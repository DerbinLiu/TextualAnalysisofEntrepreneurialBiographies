of

and
thousand
of
page
of
document
include
record
from
several
court
proceeding
there
be

number
of
different
and
often
contentious
opinion
about

of

paint
a
scene
from
the
memory
of
dozen
of
source
some
direct
witness
some
indirect
can
often
lead
to
discrepancy
i
re
create
the
scene
in
the
book
base
on
the
information
i
uncovered
from
document
and
interview
and
my
best
judgment
as
to
what
version
most
closely
fit
the
documentary
record
other
scene
be
write
in
a
way
that
describes
individual
perception
without
endorse
them
i
have
try
to
keep
the
chronology
as
close
to
exact
as
possible
in
some
instance
detail
of
setting
and
description
have
be
change
or
imagine
and
identify
detail
of
certain
people
alter
to
protect
their
privacy
other
than
the
handful
of
public
figure
who
populate
this
story
name
and
personal
description
have
be
alter
i
do
employ
the
technique
of
re
create
dialogue
i
have
base
this
dialogue
on
the
recollection
of
participant
of
the
substance
of
conversation
some
of
the
conversation
recount
in
this
book
take
place
over
long
period
of
time
in
multiple
location
and
thus
some
conversation
and
scene
be
re
create
and
compress
rather
than
spread
these
conversation
out
i
sometimes
set
these
scene
in
likely
setting
i
address
source
more
fully
in
the
acknowledgment
but
it
be
appropriate
here
to
thank
in
particular
will
mcmullen
for
introduce
me
to
eduardo
saverin
without
whom
this
story
could
not
have
be
write
mark
zuckerberg
as
be
his
perfect
right
decline
to
speak
with
me
for
this
book
despite
numerous
request
it
be
probably
the
third
cocktail
that
do
the
trick
it
be
hard
for
eduardo
to
tell
for
sure
because
the
three
drink
have
come
in
such
rapid
succession
the
empty
plastic
cup
be
now
stack
accordion
style
on
the
windowsill
behind
him
that
he
hadn
t
be
able
to
gauge
for
certain
when
the
change
have
occur
but
there
be
no
deny
it
now
the
evidence
be
all
over
him
the
pleasantly
warm
flush
to
his
normally
sallow
cheek
the
relaxed
almost
rubbery
way
he
lean
against
the
window
a
stark
contrast
to
his
usual
calcify
if
slightly
hunch
posture
and
most
important
of
all
the
easy
smile
on
his
face
something
he
d
practice
unsuccessfully
in
the
mirror
for
two
hour
before
he
d
left
his
dorm
room
that
even
no
doubt
at
all
the
alcohol
have
take
effect
and
eduardo
wasn
t
scar
anymore
at
the
very
least
he
be
no
longer
overwhelmed
with
the
intense
urge
to
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
to
be
sure
the
room
in
front
of
him
be
intimidate
the
immense
crystal
chandelier
hang
from
the
arch
cathedral
ceiling
the
thick
red
velvet
carpeting
that
seem
to
bleed
right
out
of
the
regal
mahogany
wall
the
meander
bifurcate
staircase
that
snake
up
toward
the
storied
ultrasecret
catacombed
upper
floor
even
the
windowpane
behind
eduardo
s
head
seem
treacherous
lit
from
behind
by
the
flicker
anger
of
a
bonfire
consume
most
of
the
narrow
courtyard
outside
twist
of
flame
lick
at
the
ancient
pockmarked
glass
this
be
a
terrify
place
especially
for
a
kid
like
eduardo
he
hadn
t
grown
up
poor
he
d
spent
most
of
his
childhood
be
shuttle
between
upper
middle
class
community
in
brazil
and
miami
before
matriculate
at
harvard
but
he
be
a
complete
stranger
to
the
sort
of
old
world
opulence
this
room
represent
even
through
the
booze
eduardo
could
feel
the
insecurity
rumble
deep
down
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
felt
like
a
freshman
all
over
again
step
into
harvard
yard
for
the
first
time
wonder
what
the
hell
he
be
do
there
wonder
how
he
could
possibly
belong
in
a
place
like
that
how
he
could
possibly
belong
in
a
place
like
this
he
shift
against
the
sill
scan
the
crowd
of
young
men
that
fill
most
of
the
cavernous
room
a
mob
really
bunch
together
around
the
pair
of
makeshift
bar
that
have
be
set
up
specifically
for
the
event
the
bar
themselves
be
fairly
shoddy
wooden
table
that
be
little
more
than
slab
starkly
out
of
character
in
such
an
austere
set
but
nobody
notice
because
the
bar
be
staffed
by
the
only
girl
in
the
room
match
bust
heavy
blonde
in
low
cut
black
top
brought
in
from
one
of
the
local
all
female
college
to
cater
to
the
mob
of
young
men
the
mob
in
many
way
be
even
more
frighten
than
the
building
itself
eduardo
couldn
t
tell
for
sure
but
he
guess
there
have
to
be
about
two
hundred
of
them
all
male
all
dress
in
similar
dark
blazer
and
equally
dark
slack
sophomore
mostly
a
mix
of
race
but
there
be
something
very
similar
about
all
the
face
the
smile
that
seem
so
much
easy
than
eduardo
s
the
confidence
in
those
two
hundred
pair
of
eye
these
kid
weren
t
use
to
have
to
prove
themselves
they
belong
for
most
of
them
this
party
this
place
be
just
a
formality
eduardo
take
a
deep
breath
wince
slightly
at
the
bitter
tinge
to
the
air
the
ash
from
the
bonfire
outside
be
make
its
way
through
the
windowpane
but
he
didn
t
move
away
from
his
perch
against
the
sill
not
yet
he
wasn
t
ready
yet
instead
he
let
his
attention
settle
on
the
group
of
blazer
closest
to
him
four
kid
of
medium
build
he
didn
t
recognize
any
of
them
from
his
class
two
of
the
kid
be
blond
and
preppy
look
like
they
d
just
step
off
a
train
from
connecticut
the
third
be
asian
and
seem
a
little
old
but
it
be
hard
to
tell
for
sure
the
fourth
however
african
american
and
very
polished
look
from
his
grin
to
his
perfectly
coiffed
hair
be
definitely
a
senior
eduardo
felt
his
back
stiffen
and
he
glance
toward
the
black
kid
s
tie
the
color
of
the
material
be
all
the
verification
eduardo
need
the
kid
be
a
senior
and
it
be
time
for
eduardo
to
make
his
move
eduardo
straighten
his
shoulder
and
push
off
of
the
sill
he
nod
at
the
two
connecticut
kid
and
the
asian
but
his
attention
remain
focus
on
the
old
kid
and
his
solid
black
uniquely
decorate
tie
eduardo
saverin
eduardo
introduce
himself
vigorously
shake
the
kid
s
hand
great
to
meet
you
the
kid
respond
with
his
own
name
darron
something
which
eduardo
file
away
in
the
back
of
his
memory
the
kid
s
name
didn
t
really
matter
the
tie
alone
told
him
everything
he
need
to
know
the
purpose
of
this
entire
even
lay
in
the
little
white
bird
that
speckle
the
solid
black
material
the
tie
designate
him
as
a
member
of
the
phoenix
s
k
he
be
one
of
twenty
or
so
host
of
the
even
s
affair
who
be
scatter
among
the
two
hundred
sophomore
men
saverin
you
re
the
one
with
the
hedge
fund
right
eduardo
blush
but
inside
he
be
thrill
that
the
phoenix
member
recognize
his
name
it
be
a
bit
of
an
exaggeration
he
didn
t
have
a
hedge
fund
he
d
simply
make
some
money
invest
with
his
brother
during
his
sophomore
summer
but
he
wasn
t
go
to
correct
the
mistake
if
the
phoenix
member
be
talk
about
him
if
somehow
they
be
impressed
by
what
they
d
heard
well
maybe
he
have
a
chance
it
be
a
heady
thought
and
eduardo
s
heart
start
to
beat
a
little
harder
as
he
try
to
spread
just
the
right
amount
of
bullshit
to
keep
the
senior
interested
more
than
any
test
he
d
take
freshman
or
sophomore
year
this
moment
be
go
to
define
his
future
eduardo
knew
what
it
would
mean
to
gain
entrance
to
the
phoenix
for
his
social
status
during
his
last
two
year
of
college
and
for
his
future
whatever
future
he
chose
to
chase
like
the
secret
society
at
yale
that
have
gotten
so
much
press
over
the
year
the
final
club
be
the
barely
kept
secret
soul
of
campus
life
at
harvard
house
in
century
old
mansion
spread
out
across
cambridge
the
eight
all
male
club

nurture
generation
of
world
leader
financial
giant
and
power
broker
almost
as
important
membership
in
one
of
the
eight
club
grant
an
instant
social
identity
each
of
the
club
have
a
different
personality
from
the
ultra
exclusive
porcellian
the
old
club
on
campus
whose
member
have
name
like
roosevelt
and
rockefeller
to
the
prepped
out
fly
club
which
have
spawn
two
president
and
a
handful
of
billionaire
each
of
the
club

its
own
distinct
and
instantly
define
power
the
phoenix
for
its
part
wasn
t
the
most
prestigious
of
the
club
but
in
many
way
it
be
the
social
king
of
the
hill
the
austere
building
at
mt
auburn
street
be
the
destination
of
choice
on
friday
and
saturday
night
and
if
you
be
a
member
of
the
phoenix
not
only
be
you
a
part
of
a
century
old
network
you
also
get
to
spend
your
weekend
at
the
best
party
on
campus
surround
by
the
hottest
girl
cull
from
school
all
over
the
zip
code
the
hedge
fund
be
a
hobby
really
eduardo
humbly
confide
as
the
small
group
of
blazer
hung
on
his
word
we
focus
mostly
on
oil
future
see
i
ve
always
be
obsess
with
the
weather
and
i
make
a
few
good
hurricane
prediction
that
the
rest
of
the
market
hadn
t
quite
picked
up
on
eduardo
knew
he
be
walk
a
fine
line
try
to
minimize
the
geekiness
of
how
he
d
actually
outguess
the
oil
market
he
knew
the
phoenix
member
want
to
hear
about
the
three
hundred
thousand
dollar
eduardo
have
make
trading
oil
not
the
nerdish
obsession
with
meteorology
that
have
make
the
trade
possible
but
eduardo
also
want
to
show
off
a
little
darron
s
mention
of
his
hedge
fund
only
confirm
what
eduardo
have
already
suspect
that
the
only
reason
he
be
in
that
room
in
the
first
place
be
his
reputation
as
a
budding
businessman
hell
he
knew
he
didn
t
have
much
else
go
for
him
he
wasn
t
an
athlete
didn
t
come
from
a
long
line
of
legacy
and
certainly
wasn
t
burning
up
the
social
scene
he
be
gawky
his
arm
be
a
little
too
long
for
his
body
and
he
only
really
relaxed
when
he
drank
but
still
he
be
there
in
that
room
a
year
late
most
people
be
punch
during
the
fall
of
their
sophomore
year
not
as
junior
like
eduardo
but
he
be
there
just
the
same
the
whole
punch
process
have
take
him
by
surprise
just
two
night
before
eduardo
have
be
sit
at
his
desk
in
his
dorm
room
work
on
a
twenty
page
paper
about
some
bizarre
tribe
that
live
in
the
amazonian
rain
forest
when
an
invitation
have
suddenly
appear
under
his
door
it
wasn
t
anything
like
a
fairy
tale
golden
ticket
of
the
two
hundred
mostly
sophomore
who
be
invite
to
the
first
punch
party
only
twenty
or
so
would
emerge
as
new
member
of
the
phoenix
but
the
moment
be
as
thrill
to
eduardo
as
when
he
have
open
his
harvard
acceptance
letter
he
d
be
hop
for
a
shot
at
one
of
the
club
since
he
d
gotten
to
harvard
and
now
finally
he
d
gotten
that
shot
now
it
be
just
up
to
him
and
of
course
the
kid
wear
the
black
bird
cover
tie
each
of
the
four
punch
event
like
tonight
s
meet
and
greet
cocktail
party
be
a
sort
of
mass
interview
after
eduardo
and
the
rest
of
the
invitee
be
sent
home
to
their
various
dorm
spread
across
the
campus
the
phoenix
member
would
convene
in
one
of
the
secret
room
upstairs
to
deliberate
their
fate
after
each
event
a
small
and
small
percentage
of
the
punch
would
get
the
next
invitation
and
slowly
the
two
hundred
would
be
weed
down
to
twenty
if
eduardo
make
the
cut
his
life
would
change
and
if
it
take
some
creative
elaboration
of
a
summer
spent
analyze
barometric
change
and
predict
how
those
change
would
affect
oil

pattern
well
eduardo
wasn
t
above
a
little
apply
creativity
the
real
trick
be
figure
out
how
to
turn
three
hundred
thousand
into
three
million
eduardo
grin
but
that
s
the
fun
of
hedge
fund
you
get
to
be
real
inventive
he
delve
into
the
bullshit
with
full
enthusiasm
carry
the
whole
group
of
blazer
with
him
he
d
hone
his
bullshit
skill
over
numerous
prepunch
party
as
a
freshman
and
sophomore
the
trick
be
to
forget
that
this
be
no
longer
a
dry
run
that
this
be
the
real
thing
in
his
head
he
try
to
pretend
he
be
back
at
one
of
those
less
important
mixer
when
he
wasn
t
yet
be
judged
when
he
wasn
t
try
to
end
up
on
some
all
important
list
he
could
remember
one
in
particular
that
have
go
incredibly
well
a
caribbean
theme
party
with
faux
palm
tree
and
sand
on
the
floor
he
try
to
put
himself
back
there
remember
the
less
impose
detail
of
the
decor
remember
how
simple
and
easy
the
conversation
have
come
within
moment
he
felt
himself
relax
even
more
allow
himself
to
become
enrapt
in
his
own
story
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
he
be
back
at
that
caribbean
party
down
to
the
last
detail
he
remember
the
reggae
music
bounce
off
the
wall
the
sound
of
steel
drum
biting
at
his
ear
he
remember
the
rum
base
punch
the
girl
in
flower
bikini
he
even
remember
the
kid
with
the
mop
of
curly
hair
who
have
be
stand
in
a
corner
of
the
room
barely
ten
foot
away
from
where
he
be
now
watch
his
progress
try
to
get
up
the
nerve
to
follow
his
lead
and
approach
one
of
the
old
phoenix
kid
before
it
be
too
late
but
the
kid
have
never
move
from
the
corner
in
fact
his
self
defeat
awkwardness
have
be
so
palpable
it
have
act
like
a
force
field
carve
out
an
area
of
the
room
around
him
a
sort
of
reverse
magnetism
push
anyone
nearby
away
eduardo
have
felt
a
tinge
of
sympathy
at
the
time
because
he
have
recognize
that
kid
with
the
curly
hair
and
because
there
be
no
way
in
hell
a
kid
like
that
be
ever
go
to
get
into
the
phoenix
a
kid
like
that
have
no
business
punch
any
of
the
final
club
god
only
knew
what
he
have
be
do
there
at
the
prepunch
party
in
the
first
place
harvard
have
plenty
of
little
niche
for
kid
like
that
computer
lab
chess
guild
dozen
of
underground
organization
and
hobby
catering
to
every
imaginable
twist
of
social
impairment
one
look
at
the
kid
and
it
have
be
obvious
to
eduardo
that
he
didn
t
know
the
first
thing
about
the
sort
of
social
networking
one
have
to
master
to
get
into
a
club
like
the
phoenix
but
then
as
now
eduardo
have
be
too
busy
chase
his
dream
to
spend
much
time
think
about
the
awkward
kid
in
the
corner
certainly
he
have
no
way
of
know
then
or
now
that
the
kid
with
the
curly
hair
be
one
day
go
to
take
the
entire
concept
of
a
social
network
and
turn
it
on
its
head
that
one
day
the
kid
with
the
curly
hair
struggle
through
that
prepunch
party
be
go
to
change
eduardo
s
life
more
than
any
final
club
ever
could
ten
minute
past
one
in
the
morning
and
something
have
go
terribly
wrong
with
the
decoration
it
wasn
t
just
that
the
ribbon
of
white
and
blue
color
crepe
paper
attach
to
the
wall
have
start
to
droop
one
of
them
bow
so
low
that
its
taffeta
like
curl
threaten
to
overwhelm
the
oversize
punch
bowl
perch
below
but
now
the
brightly
design
decorative
poster
that
cover
much
of
the
bare
space
between
the
crepe
paper
have
also
begin
to
unhinge
and
drop
to
the
floor
at
an
alarm
rate
in
some
area
the
beige
carpet
have
almost
vanished
beneath
pile
of
glossy
computer
print
page
on
closer
inspection
the
catastrophe
of
the
decoration
make
more
sense
the
peel
strip
of
pack
tape
that
held
the
color
poster
and
crepe
paper
ribbon
in
place
be
clearly
visible
and
what
s
more
a
sheen
of
condensation
be
slowly
work
the
strip
of
tape
free
as
the
heat
from
the
overwork
radiator
that
line
the
wall
played
havoc
with
the
hastily
construct
ambience
the
heat
be
necessary
of
course
because
it
be
new

there
be
no

compete
with
the

begin
to

thought
out

even
so
the
music
wasn

half
bad
and
the

a

it
over

out
of
respect
for
the

a
far
cry
from
the
greek
bacchanalia
one

at

and
epsilon

my

with
the
hottest

possible
i
ve
get
to
stock
my
pond
with
the
type
of

who

the
most
likely
to
be
interested
the
other
kid
nod
appreciate
his
logic
in
the

they
d
take
this
simple
equation

elaborate
it
into
a
much
more
complex
algorithm
to
try
to
explain
the
connection
between
jewish
guy
and

girl
but
tonight
they
just
let
it
remain
simple
perhaps
out
of
respect
for
the
music
which
be
now
reverberate
so
loudly
through
the
expensive
speaker
that
it
be
hard
to
engage
in
any
complex
thought
although
at
the
moment
eduardo
grimace
as
he
glance
toward
the
girl
in
the
skirt
legging
combination
this
pond
s
run
a
little
dry
again
agreement

around

it
wasn

like
any
of
his
four
frat
mate

go
to
do
anything
about
the

the

and
pudgy
he
be
also
on
the
harvard
chess

and
spoke
six

none
of
that
seem
to
help
when
it
come
to
communicate
with

the

next
to

instead

student
at
a
mostly
jewish
prep

he
be
good
with
an

about

he
be
ready

otherwise

much
useless
the
fourth

directly
across
from

but
he
wasn

to
his
left
he
be
a
bit
on
the
gawky
side
like
eduardo

his

be
more
proportionate
to
his
slim
not
entirely
unathletic
frame
he
be

blondish

there
be
something
playful
about
those

that
be
where
any
sense
of
natural
emotion
or
readability
end
his
narrow
face
be
otherwise
devoid
of
any
expression
at
all
and
his
posture
his

the
way
he
seem
close
in
on
himself
even
while
engage
in
a
group

even
here
in
the

of

almost
painfully
awkward
his
name
be
mark

he
be
a
sophomore
and
although
eduardo
have
spent
a

along
with
at

certainly
a
computer

almost
zero

in

and
it
be
impossible
for
eduardo
to
guess
what

everything
in
around
him
even
here
in
a
place
with
so
little

the
genius
everyone

before
you
graduate
the
truth
be
only
a
handful
of

find
a
spot
isolated

quite
a
feat
and
find
a
girl
who
be
willing
to
attempt
to
continue
the
tradition
be
even
more
unlikely

eduardo
wince
then
grin
again
he
be

along
the
side
of

there
it
be
again
zero
inflection
but
eduardo
could
tell
from
the
little
flash
in
mark
s
eye
that
he
be
impressed
and
more
than
a
little
envious
that
be
the
reaction
eduardo
have
learn
to
expect
when
he
mention
the
punch
process
he
be
go
through
the
truth
be
he
d
be
let
it
slip
to
everyone
he
knew
that
he
be
get
closer
and
closer
to
become
a
member
of
the
phoenix
he
d
be
through
three
punch
event
already
there
be
a
very
good
chance
now
that
he
d
go
the
distance
and
maybe
just
maybe
event
like
the
alpha
epsilon
pi
party
they
d
just
survive
would
be
a
thing
of
the
past
well
if
i
get
in
maybe
i
can
put
your
name
on
the
list
for
next
year
you
could
punch
as
a
junior
mark
pause
again
maybe
he
be
catch
his
breath
more
likely
he
be
digest
the
information
there
be
something
very
computer
like
about
the
way
he
spoke
input
in
then
input
out
that
would
be
interest
if
you
get
to
know
some
of
the
other
member
you
ll
have
a
good
shot
i
m
sure

eduardo
knew
as
he
say
it
how
foolish
the
idea
sound
phoenix
member
weren
t
go
to
get
excite
about
this
awkward
kid
because
of
some
computer
program
you
didn
t
get
popular
by
write
computer
code
a
computer
program
couldn
t
get
you
laid
you
get
popular
and
sometimes
laid
by
go
to
party
hang
out
with
pretty
girl
eduardo
hadn
t
gotten
that
far
yet
but
last
night
he
have
receive
that
all
important
fourth

in
one
week
next
friday

then
an
after
party
at
the

a
big
night
perhaps
the
final
big
punch
event
before
new
member

initiate
the
invitation
have
suggest
that
eduardo
bring
a
date
to
the
dinner
he
d
heard
from
classmate
that
in
fact
the
member
would
be
judging
the
punch
on
the
quality
of
the
woman
they
brought
with
them
the
well
look
their
date
the
more
likely
it
be
that
they
d
get
through
to
the
final
punch
round
after
receive
the
letter
eduardo
have
wonder
how
the
hell
he
be
go
to
get
a
date
an
impressive
one
at
that
on
such
short
notice
it
wasn
t
like
the
girl
be
break
down
his
dorm
room
door
so
eduardo
have
be
force
to
take
matter
into
his
own
hand
at
nine
a
m
that
morning
in
the
eliot
din
hall
he
have
walk
right
up
to
the
hottest
girl
he
knew
marsha
blond
buxom
in
reality
an
econ
major
but
she
look
like
a
psychology
major
she
be
a
good
two
inch
taller
than
eduardo
and
have
a
strange
predisposition
toward
eighty
style
hair
scrunchies
but
she
be
beautiful
in
a
northeast
prep
school
sort
of
way
in
short
she
be
perfect
for
the
punch
event
to
eduardo
s
surprise
she
d
say
yes
eduardo
have
immediately
realize
it
be
the
phoenix
it
wasn
t
about
eduardo
it
be
about
go
to
a
final
club
dinner
which
bolster
everything
eduardo
already
believe
about
the
final
club
not
only
be
they
a
powerful
social
network
but
their
exclusive
nature
give
their
member
instant
status
the
ability
to
attract
the
coolest
hottest
best
he
have
no
illusion
that
marsha
be
go
to
join
him
in
the
widener
stack
after
the
event
but
at
the
very
least
if
enough
alcohol
be
involve
she
might
let
him
walk
her
home
even
if
she
brush
him
off
at
the
door
to
her
room
with
a
little
kiss
that
would
be
far
than
he
d
gotten
in
four
month
as
they
reach
the
back
corner
of
the
library
and
jogged
out
from
under
the
long
shadow
of
the
building
s
archaic
stone
pillar
mark
shot
him
another
unreadable
glance
be
it
everything

it

to
tell
where
the

end
and
the

begin
dead
silence
a
moment
frozen
in

a

on
a

in
a

that
span
three
century
of
pregnant
frozen

this
dead
silence
and
then
the
slightest
of
noise
the
sound
of
two
knifelike
oar
dipped
expertly
into
that
frigid
glade
pivot
beneath
the
swirl
of
greenish
blue
lever
backward
in
a
perfect
and
complex
marriage
of
mechanic
and
art
a
second
later
a

slid
out
from

the

almost
seem
a

the

of

seem
to

out

so
pure
it
produce
almost
no

it

that
the

to
the

it
certainly
felt

up
every

there
be
some
day
when
it
seem
like
all
they
do
be
row
eat
and
sometimes
sleep
tyler
shift
his
gaze
from

the
kid

across
from

he
be
hold
open
in

of
him
with
both
hand
there
be
an
untouched
bowl
of
oatmeal
beneath
the
newspaper
and
tyler
be
pretty
sure
that
if
divya
didn
t
put
down
the
paper
soon
enough
cameron
would
probably
get
that
as
well
if
tyler
hadn
t
already
finish
a
tray
almost
twice
as
load
as
cameron
s
before
he
d
join
them
at
the
rear
table
he
d
have
take
the
oatmeal
down
himself
divya
wasn
t
an
athlete
like
they
be
but
he
certainly
understood
their
passion
and
work
ethic
he
be
as
sharp
a
kid
as
tyler
have
ever
met
and
together
the
three
of
them
have
be
work
pretty
intensely
on
a
somewhat
secret
project
for
quite
some
time
a
sort
of
side
venture
in
their
life
one
that
have
slowly
begin
to
take
on
more
import
ironically
the
busier
their
life
become
tyler
clear
his
throat
then
wait
for
divya
to
put
the
paper
down
so
they
could
get
start
divya
held
up
a
finger
ask
for
a
minute
tyler
roll
his
eye
frustrate
as
he
do
so
his
attention
drift
to
the
table
directly
behind
divya
a
group
of
girl
kept
glance
back
at
him
and
cameron
when
he
look
right
at
them
they
quickly
look
away
it
be
something
tyler
have
grown
pretty
use
to
because
it
happen
all
the
time
hell
he
and
cameron
be
identical
twin
he
knew
that
be
something
unusual
there
be
a
slight
freak
show
element
to
it
but
here
at
harvard
it
be
even
more
than
that
they
be
on
track
to
become
olympic
athlete
and
still
that
be
only
part
of
it
as
well
tyler
and
cameron
have
a
certain
status
on
campus
a
status
that
start
with
them
be
premier
athlete
but
carry
over
into
something
else
the
turn
point
of
course
be
easy
for
tyler
to
pinpoint
he
and
his
brother
have
become
member
of
the
porcellian
club
during
their
junior
year
that
they
have
be
punch
as
junior
be
pretty
unusual
not
only
be
the
porcellian
the
most
prestigious
secretive
and
old
final
club
on
campus
but
it
be
also
the
small
in
term
of
number
of
member
and
new
punch
and
it
be
especially
rare
for
student
to
get
punch
for
the
porc
a
year
late
tyler
be
pretty
sure
the
club
have
wait
the
extra
year
to
bring
them
in
because
of
their
background
most
member
of
the
porc
have
name
with
hundred
year
history
at
harvard
although
tyler
and
cameron
s
father
be
immensely
wealthy
he
d
make
his
money
himself
building
a
highly
successful
consult
company
from
the
ground
up
tyler
and
cameron
weren
t
from
old
money
but
they
certainly
be
from
money
at
the
fly
or
the
phoenix
that
would
have
be
enough
at
the
porc
there
have
to
be
more
the
porc
after
all
wasn
t
a
social
institution
like
the
phoenix
for
one
thing
woman
be
not
allow
inside
the
club
on
a
member
s
wedding
day
he
could
bring
his
wife
on
a
tour
of
the
building
then
during
his
twenty
fifth
reunion
he
could
bring
her
again
and
that
be
it
only
the
famed
bicycle
room
a
preparty
hot
spot
adjacent
to
the
club
proper
be
accessible
to
nonmember
and
coeds
the
porc
wasn
t
about
party
or
about
get
laid
like
the
other
club
on
campus
it
be
about
the
future
it
be
about
status
the
sort
of
status
that
get
you
star
at
in
the
din
hall
in
the
classroom
when
you
be

across
harvard
yard
the
porc
wasn
t
a
social

it
be
serious
business
which
be
something
tyler
could
appreciate
serious
business
after
all
that
s
why
he
and
his
brother
be
meeting
with
divya
that
morning
in
the

an
hour
later

tyler
turn
his
attention
away
from
the
blushing

at
the

then
grabbed
a
half

off
of

that
rag
tyler
ask
grin
at
his
friend
it
s
a
complete
waste
of
time
i
like
to
know
what
my
fellow
student
be
up
to
divya
respond
i
think
it
s
important
to
keep
a
finger
on
the
pulse
of
the
student
body
one
day
we
re
go
to
launch
this
freak
company
and
then
this
rag
be
go
to
be
real
important
to
us
don
t
you
think
tyler
shrug
but
he
knew
divya
be
right
divya
be
usually
right
which
be
the
main
reason
tyler
and
cameron
have
partner
with
him
in
the
first
place
they
have
be
meeting
like
this
once
a
week
sometimes
more
often
since
december
of
almost
two
full
year
well
we
re
not
go
to
launch
anything
unless
we
find
someone
to
replace
victor
cameron
interrupt
around
a
mouthful
of
egg
that
s
for
damn
sure
he
s
really
out
tyler
ask
yep
divya
respond
he
say
he
s
get
too
much
on
his
plate
he
can
t
put
any
more
time
into
this
we
need
a
new
programmer
and
it
s
gonna
be
hard
to
find
someone
as
good
as
victor
tyler
sigh
two
full
year
and
it
seem
like
they
be
no
closer
to
launch
than
they
be
when
they
have
first
start
victor
gua
have
be
a
great
asset
a
computer
whiz
who
d
understood
what
they
be
try
to
build
but
he
d
be
unable
to
finish
the
site
and
now
he
be
go
if
only
tyler
cameron
or
divya
have
the
necessary
computer
background
to
get
the
thing
off
and
run
christ
tyler
knew
in
his
soul
that
the
company
be
go
to
be
a
huge
success
it
be
such
an
amaze
idea
something
divya
have
initially
come
up
with
then
he
and
cameron
have
help
hone
into
what
they
all
humbly
consider
pure
genius
the
project
be
call
the
harvard
connection
and
it
be
a
web
site
that
be
go
to
change
life
on
campus
if
they
could
only
get
someone
to
write
the
computer
code
that
would
make
it
work
the
central
idea
be
simple
put
harvard
s
social
life
online
make
a
site
where
guy
like
tyler
and
cameron
who
spent
all
their
time
row
eat
and
sleep
could
meet
up
with
girl
like
the
one
steal
glance
at
them
from
the
next
table
over
without
all
the
inefficient
time
waste
wander
around
campus
that
real
life
usually
necessitate
as
member
of
the
harvard
elite
tyler
and
cameron
be
in
a
unique
position
to
see
how
flaw
harvard
s
social
scene
be
eligible
guy
like
them
never
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
enough
choice
girl
because
they
be
too
busy
do
the
thing
that
make
them
such
hot
property
on
campus
a
web
site
gear
toward
socialize
could
fix
that
problem
could
create
a
fluid
environment
where
girl
and
guy
could
meet
the
harvard
connection
would
fulfill
a
need
in
what
be
mostly
a
stagnant
social
scene
right
now
if
you
rowed
crew
or
played
baseball
or
football
that
s
all
you
ever
do
the
only
girl
you
ever
met
be
the
one
who
hung
around
the
river
or
the
baseball
field
or
the
gridiron
if
you
live
in
the
quad
quad
girl
be
all
you
d
ever
have
access
to
sure
you
could
drop
the
h
bomb
on
anyone
within
range
meaning
you
could
use
your
harvard
male
status
to
bring
down
interested
party
within
your
proximity
but
a
site
like
the
harvard
connection
would
vastly
increase
your
range
simple
perfect
fulfil
a
need
the
site
would
have
two
section
date
and
connect
and
once
it
succeed
at
harvard
tyler
and
cameron
foresaw
the
site
move
to
other
college
maybe
throughout
the
ivy
every
school
have
its
own
version
of
the
h
bomb
after
all
the
only
flaw
in
their
business
plan
be
they
didn
t
have
any
way
in
hell
of
make
the
site
without
the
help
of
a
real
computer
genius
tyler
and
cameron
have
taught
themselves
html
while
in
high
school
but
they
weren
t
good
enough
to
build
something
like
this
truth
be
they
need
a
real
geek
to
make
their
social
site
work
not
just
someone
smart
someone
who
get
what
they
be
try
to
do
the
harvard
connection
be
go
to
be
something
harvard
kid
actually
use
every
weekend
an
addition
to
their
social
routine
you
d
shower
shave
make
some
call
then
check
out
the
connection
and
see
who
d
be
check
you
out

as
he
shook
the

over
the
oatmeal
bowl
try
to
dry
it
off
some
kid
from
his
computer

we
can
start
interview
people
throw
the
word
around
that
we

look
for
someone
i
can
ask
around
the
porc
cameron
add
i
mean
nobody
there
s
gonna
know
much
about
computer
but
maybe
someone
s
get
a
young
brother
great
tyler
thought
next
they
d
be
post
a
want
add

science
center
and
hang
around
the
computer
lab

at

and
despite
his
frustration
he
have
to
smile

such
a
polished
guy
the
son
of
two
indian

follow
his
old
brother
into
harvard
he
be
always
well
dress
well
coiffed
well
spoken
nobody
would
have
guess
that
he
be
a
genius
on
the
electric
guitar
specifically
a
technical
master
of
heavy
metal
riff
in
public
he
be
so
freak
dapper
he
even
like
to
keep
his
newspaper
clean
while
he
watch
divya
and
the
newspaper
tyler
s
gaze
inadvertently
shift
back
to
the
table
of
girl
behind
his
friend

tallest
of
the
group
a
brunette

brown

a
low

under
a
carefully
torn

right
at
him
smile
over
a
purposefully
reveal
slice
of
tan
shoulder
tyler
couldn
t
help
but
smile
back
at
her
divya
coughed
interrupt
tyler
s
thought
i
highly
doubt
she
s
interested
in
html
code
couldn
t
hurt
to
ask
tyler
respond
as
he
wink
at
the
brunette
then
he
rise
from
the
table
their
meeting
have
be
short
but
until
they
found
themselves
a
new
victor
there
wasn
t
much
else
that
they
could
do
he
start
toward
the
group
of
girl
then
pause
to
grin
at
his
indian
friend
and
his
oatmeal
cover
newspaper
one
thing
i
know
for
sure
you
re
not
go
to
find
us
a
computer
programmer
in
the
fuck
crimson
eduardo
push
open
the
huge
double
door
as
quietly
as
he
could
and
slid
into
the
back
of
the
enormous
lecture
hall
the
lecture
be
already
in
full
swing
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
movie
theater
style
room
on
a
raise
stage
that
be
backlit
by
a
handful
of
industrial
size
spotlight
a
rotund
little
man
in
a
tweed
sport
coat
bounce
up
and
down
behind
a
massive
oak
lectern
the
man
be
fully
energize
his
round
little
cheek
bright
red
with
passion
his
spindly
arm
jerked
up
and
down
and
every
few
minute
he
slap
them
against
the
lectern
send
a
gunshotlike
pop
through
the
speaker
that
hung
from
the
hall
s
ridiculously
high
ceiling
then
he
d
gesture
over
his
shoulder
where
behind
him
spread
across
a
ten
foot
high
blackboard
hung
a
full
color
map
that
look
like
a
cross
between
something
from
a
tolkien
book
and
something
that
might
have
hung
in
fdr
s
war
room
eduardo
have
no
idea
what
class
this
be
or
what
this
lecture
be
about
he
didn
t
recognize
the
professor
but
that
wasn
t
unusual
there
be
so
many
professor
teach
fellow
and
senior
tutor
at
harvard
one
couldn
t
possibly
be
expect
to
keep
them
all
straight
he
could
tell
from
the
size
of
the
room
and
the
fact
that
the
three
hundred
seat
theater
be
near
full
that
it
be
some
sort
of
core
requirement
because
only
core
class
be
this
big
as
they
be
mandatory
what
student
like
eduardo
and
mark
consider
necessary
evil
of
harvard
life
the
core
at
harvard
be
more
than
a
requirement
it
be
also
what
the
school
consider
a
philosophy
the
idea
be
that
every
student
have
to
devote
at
least
a
quarter
of
their
class
time
to
course
that
be
design
to
create
a
round
scholar
the
core
category
be
foreign
culture
historical
study
literature
moral
reason
quantitative
reason
science
and
social
analysis
the
idea
seem
sound
but
in
practice
the
core
didn
t
come
close
to
living
up
to
its
lofty
ideal
because
at
their
heart
the
core
class
cater
to
the
low
common
denominator
as
nobody
take
a
core
course
because
they
be
actually
interested
in
the
subject
so
instead
of
deep
scholarly
course
on
history
and
the
art
you
have
class
such
as
folklore
and
mythology
or
as
it
be
affectionately
know
by
the
kid
who
slept
through
its
vast
lecture
greek
for
geek
a
simple
intro
to
physic
physic
for
poet
and
a
half
dozen
bizarre
anthropology
course
that
have
little
or
no
relevance
to
the
real
world
because
of
the
core
nearly
every
harvard
graduate
have
take
at
least
one
course
that
dealt
with
the
yanomam
the
fierce
people
of
the
amazonian
rain
forest
a
bizarre
little
tribe
that
still
live
like
they
be
in
the
stone
age
a
harvard
grad
didn
t
need
to
know
much
politics
or
math
but
ask
about
the
yanomam
and
any
grad
could
tell
you
that
they
be
very
fierce
that
they
often
fought
each
other
with
big
long
stick
and
engage
in
strange
pierce
ritual
that
be
even
more
disturb
than
those
engage
in
by
the
kid
who
hung
out
in
the
skateboard
pit
in
the
center
of
harvard
square
from
the
back
of
the
vast
room
eduardo
watch
the
professor
hop
about
behind
the
lectern
catch
an
odd
word
or
phrase
from
the
echo
sound
system
up
above
from
what
he
could
tell
this
particular
core
class
have
something
to
do
with
history
or
philosophy
on
closer
inspection
the
map
behind
the
prof
look
to
be
europe
sometime
in
the
past
three
hundred
year
but
that
didn
t
really
clear
thing
up
eduardo
doubt
the
class
have
anything
to
do
with
the
yanomam
but
at
harvard
you
couldn
t
be
sure
this
particular
morning
he
wasn
t
there
to
get
himself
a
little
more
well
round
he
be
on
a
mission
of
a
very
different
nature
he
scan
the
room
use
one
hand
to
shield
his
eye
from
the
immense
spot
on
the
stage
which
seem
to
be
aim
in
exactly
the
wrong
direction
for
what
they
d
be
design
to
do
his
other
hand
be
occupy
cradle
beneath
his
left
arm
be
a
bulky
crate
cover
by
a
large
blue
towel
the
crate
be
heavy
and
eduardo
be
very
careful
not
to
jostle
the
damn
thing
as
he
search
the
row
of
student
for
his
quarry
it
take
him
a
few
minute
to
locate
mark
sit
by
himself
three
row
from
the
very
back
of
the
room
mark
have
his
sandaled
foot
up
on
the
seat
in
front
of
him
which
be
empty
and
a
notebook
spread
open
on
his
lap
he
didn
t
seem
to
be
take
any
note
in
fact
he
didn
t
seem
to
be
awake
at
all
his
eye
be
close
his
head
mostly
cover
by
the
oversize
hood
of
the
fleece
he
almost
always
wore
and
his
hand
be
jammed
deep
into
the
pocket
of
his
jean
eduardo
grin
to
himself
in
a
matter
of
a
few
short
week
he
and
mark
have
become
close
friend
even
though
they
live
in
different
house
and
have
different
major
eduardo
felt
that
they
have
a
similar
spirit
and
he
d
begin
to
notice
an
almost
strange
feel
that
they
be
suppose
to
be
friend
even
before
they
be
in
that
short
time
he
d
grown
to
really
like
mark
have
begin
to
think
of
him
like
a
real
brother
not
just
someone
who
share
a
jewish
frat
and
he
be
pretty
sure
mark
felt
the
same
way
about

and
whoever
the

eduardo

thought
anything
of
it
when
the

the
fact
that

to
feed
the
chicken
some
fry
chicken
he
d
smuggle

admit
that
it

a
pretty
good
prank
by
the
porc
kid
but
it
be
a
huge
headache
for
the
phoenix
thankfully
the
phoenix
leadership
hadn
t
trace
the
fiasco
back
to
eduardo
yet
though
even
if
they
do
they
d
hopefully
see
the
humor
in
the
situation
of
course
eduardo
hadn
t
be
order
to
torture
and
kill
his
chicken
exactly
the
opposite
he
d
be
order
to
keep
his
chicken
healthy
and
alive
maybe
feed
the
chicken
chicken
be
a
mistake
how
be
he
suppose
to
know
what
chicken
ate
the
thing
hadn
t
come
with
a
manual
eduardo
have
go
to
a
jewish
prep
school
in
miami
what
the
hell
do
jew
know
about
chicken
other
than
the
fact
that
they
make
pretty
good
soup
the
entire
debacle
have
almost
overshadow
the
fact
that
eduardo
be
nearly
finish
with
his
initiation
period
in
a
few
more
day
he
be
go
to
be
a
full
fledge
member
of
the
phoenix
if
the
chicken
fiasco
didn
t
end
up
get
him
kick
out
pretty
soon
he
d
be
hang
out
in
the
club
every
weekend
and
his
social
life
be
go
to
change
dramatically
already
those
change
have
begin
to
take
effect
he
lean
toward
mark
keep
his
hand
on
the
cover
crate
try
to
soothe
the
still
anxious
bird
into
a
few
more
minute
of
silence
i
ve
get
to
get
out
of
here
before
this
thing
erupts
again
he
whisper
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
we
re
still
on
for
tonight
mark
raise
his
eyebrow
and
eduardo
nod
smile
the
night
before
he
d
met
a
girl
at
a
phoenix
cocktail
hour
her
name
be
angie
she
be
cute
and
slim
and
asian
and
she
have
a
friend
eduardo
have
convince
her
to
bring
the
friend
along
and
now
the
four
of
them
be
go
to
meet
up
for
a
drink
at
grafton
street
grille
a
month
ago
such
a
thing
would
have
be
almost
unthinkable
what
s
her
name
again
mark
ask
the
friend
i
mean
monica
and
she
s
hot
the
truth
be
eduardo
have
no
idea
if
monica
be
hot
or
not
he
d
never
see
the
girl
but
in
his
mind
neither
one
of
them
have
the
right
to
be
so
choosy
up
until
now
the
lady
hadn
t
exactly
be
knock
down
the
door
to
get
to
them
now
that
eduardo
be
almost
in
the
phoenix
he
be
start
to
have
access
to
woman
and
he
be
determine
to
bring
his
friend
along
with
him
he
couldn
t
yet
get
mark
into
the
phoenix
himself
but
he
could
certainly
introduce
him
to
a
girl
or
two
mark
shrug
and
eduardo
gently
lift
the
crate
and
rise
to
his
foot
as
he
start
down
the
row
toward
the
aisle
he
cast
a
quick
glance
back
at
mark
s
outfit
the
customary
adidas
flip
flop
jean
and
the
fleece
hoody
then
eduardo
straighten
his
own
tie
brush
chicken
feather
off
the
lapel
of
his
dark
blue
blazer
the
tie
and
blazer
be
almost
a
uniform
for
him
on
day
he
have
meeting
for
the
investment
association
he
even
wore
a
suit
just
be
there
at
eight
he
call
back
to
mark
as
he
exit
the
row
and
mark
yeah
try
and
wear
something
nice
for
a
change
behind
every
great
fortune
there
lie
a
great
crime
if
balzac
have
somehow
risen
from
the
dead
to
witness
mark
zuckerberg
storm
into
his
kirkland
dorm
room
that
monumental
even
during
the
last
week
of
october
he
might
have
amend
his
famous
word
because
that
historical
moment
one
that
inarguably
lead
to
one
of
the
great
fortune
in
modern
history
do
not
begin
with
a
crime
so
much
as
a
college
prank
if
the
newly
revive
balzac
have
be
there
in
that
spartan
claustrophobic
dorm
he
might
have
see
mark
head
straight
for
his
computer
there
would
have
be
no
question
that
the
kid
be
angry
and
that
he
have
with
him
a
number
of
beck
s
beer
as
usual
he
be
probably
wear
his
adidas
flip
flop
and
a
hoody
sweatshirt
it
be
well
know
that
he
pretty
much
hat
any
shoe
that
weren
t
flip
flop
and
one
day
he
be
determine
to
be
in
a
position
where
those
be
the
only
shoe
he
d
ever
have
to
wear
maybe
mark
take
a
deep
swig
of
the
beer
let
the
bitter
taste
bite
at
the
back
of
his
throat
as
he
tapped
his
finger
against
the
laptop
keyboard
gently
summon
the
thing
awake
since
high
school
it
could
be
observe
his
thought
have
always
seem
clearer
when
he
let
them
come
out
through
his
hand
to
an
outside
observer
the
relationship
he
have
with
his
computer
seem
much
smoother
than
any
relationship
he
d
ever
have
with
anyone
in
the
outside
world
he
never
seem
happier
than
when
he
be
look
through
his
own
reflection
into
that
glassy
screen
maybe
deep
down
it
have
something
to
do
with
control
with
the
computer
mark
be
always
in
control
or
maybe
it
be
more
than
that
an
almost
symbiosis
that
have
grown
out
of
year
and
year
of
practice
the
way
mark
s
finger
touch
those
key
this
be
where
he
belong
sometimes
it
probably
felt
like
this
be
the
only
place
he
belong
that
even
at
a
little
after
eight
p
m
he
star
into
the
brightly
lit
screen
his
finger
find
the
right
key
opening
up
a
fresh
blog
page
something
that
have
most
likely
be
percolate
in
the
back
of
his
mind
for
a
few
day
the
frustration
likely
the
result
of
the
even
he
have
just
have
be
it
seem
the
final
impetus
to
move
far
along
with
the
idea
turn
the
kernel
into
corn
he
start
with
a
title
harvard
face
mash
the
process
he
might
have
look
at
the
word
for
a
few
minute
wonder
if
he
be
really
go
to
go
through
with
this
he
might
have
take
another
drink
from
his
beer
and
hunch
forward
over
the
key

and
some
of
these
people
have
pretty
horrendous
facebook
pic
maybe
he
grin
as
he
scan
through
the
picture
that
be
now
spread
across
the
screen
of
his
desktop
certainly
he
recognize
some
of
the
guy
and
even
a
few
of
the
girl
but
most
of
them
be
probably
stranger
to
him
even
though
he
d
pass
them
in
the
din
hall
or
on
his
way
to
his
class
he
be
probably
a
complete
stranger
to
them
too
some
of
the
girl
for
sure
have
go
out
of
their
way
to
ignore
him
i
almost
want
to
put
some
of
these
face
next
to
picture
of
farm
animal
and
have
people
vote
on
which
be
more
attractive
at
some
point
during
this
process
mark
begin
to
exchange
idea
with
his
friend
who
have
gotten
home
from
dinner
class
drink
most
of
the
communication
come
as
it
usually
do
via
e
mail
nobody
in
his
circle
use
the
phone
much
anymore
it
be
all
e
mail
other
than
eduardo
they
be
all
almost
as
infatuate
with
their
computer
as
mark
be
he
turn
back
to
the
blog
it
s
not
such
a
great
idea
and
probably
not
even
funny
but
billy
come
up
with
the
idea
of
compare
two
people
from
the
facebook
and
only
sometimes
put
a
farm
animal
in
there
good
call
mr
olson
i
think
he
s
onto
something
yes
to
a
kid
like
mark
it
must
have
indeed
seem
a
great
idea
the
kirkland
housing
facebook
all
of
the
school
s
facebooks
as
their
database
of
student
photo
be
know
be
such
a
stagnant
thing
compile
entirely
in
alphabetical
order
by
the
university
the
percolation
that
must
have
gripped
mark
s
imagination
for
a
few
day
be
now
form
into
something
real
an
idea
for
a
web
site
to
mark
it
s
likely
that
the
cool
thing
be
the
math
that
be
go
to
go
into
it
the
computer
science
of
the
task
the
code
at
the
heart
of
the
web
site
idea
it
wasn
t
just
a
matter
of
write
a
program
it
be
also
create
the
correct
algorithm
there
be
some
complexity
to
it
that
his
friend
would
surely
appreciate
even
if
the
large
campus
of
bimbo
and
neanderthal
never
understood
pm
yea
it
s
on
i
m
not
exactly
sure
how
the
farm
animal
be
go
to
fit
into
this
whole
thing
you
can
t
really
ever
be
sure
with
farm
animal
but
i
like
the
idea
of
compare
two
people
together
it
give
the
whole
thing
a
very
turing
feel
since
people
s
rating
of
the
picture
will
be
more
implicit
than
say
choose
a
number
to
represent
each
person
s
hotness
like
they
do
on
hotornot
com
the
other
thing
we
re
go
to
need
be
a
lot
of
picture
unfortunately
harvard
doesn
t
keep
a
public
centralize
facebook
so
i
m
go
to
have
to
get
all
the
image
from
the
individual
house
that
people
be
in
and
that
mean
no
freshman
picture
drats
maybe
at
this
point
he
knew
that
he
be
about
to
cross
a
line
but
then
he
d
never
be
very
good
at
stay
within
the
line
that
be
eduardo
s
game
wear
a
jacket
and
tie
join
that
final
club
play
along
with
everyone
else
in
the
sandbox
from
mark
s
history
it
be
obvious
that
he
didn
t
like
the
sandbox
he
seem
the
type
who
want
to
kick
out
all
the
sand
be
let
the
hack
begin
first
on
the
list
be
kirkland
they
keep
everything
open
and
allow
index
in
their
apache
configuration
so
a
little
wget
magic
be
all
that
s
necessary
to
download
the
entire
kirkland
facebook
child
s
play
it
really
be
that
simple
for
mark
most
likely
in
a
matter
of
minute
he
have
all
the
picture
from
the
kirkland
facebook
download
off
of
the
university
s
server
and
into
his
laptop
sure
in
a
sense
it
be
steal
he
didn
t
have
the
legal
right
to
those
picture
and
the
university
certainly
didn
t
put
them
up
there
for
someone
to
download
them
but
then
if
information
be
getable
didn
t
mark
have
the
right
to
get
it
what
sort
of
evil
authority
could
decide
that
he
wasn
t
allow
access
to
something
he
so
easily
could
access
be
next
on
the
list
be
eliot
they
re
also
open
but
with
no
index
in
apache
i
can
run
an
empty
search
and
it
return
all
of
the
image
in
the
database
in
a
single
page
then
i
can
save
the
page
and
mozilla
will
save
all
the
image
for
me
excellent
move
right
along
he
be
now
deep
in
hacker
s
paradise
break
into
harvard
s
computer
system
really
be
child
s
play
to
him
he
be
smarter
than
anyone
harvard
have
employ
to
make
the
system
he
be
smarter
than
the
administration
and
he
be
certainly
smarter
than
the
security
system
harvard
have
put
into
place
really
he
be
teach
them
a
lesson
show
them
the
flaw
in
their
system
he
be
do
a
good
deed
though
it
be
pretty
likely
that
they
wouldn
t
have
see
it
that
way
but
hey
mark
be
document
what
he
be
do
right
there
in
his
blog
and
when
he
built
the
web
site
he
be
go
to
put
that
blog
right
there
on
the
site
for
everyone
to
see
maybe
crazy
a
little
but
that
be
go
to
be
the
ice
on
the
cake
be
lowell
have
some
security
they
require
a
username
password
combo
to
access
the
facebook
i
m
go
to
go
ahead
and
say
that
they
don
t
have
access
to
the
main
fa
user
database
so
they
have
no
way
of
know
what
people
s
password
be
and
the
house
isn
t
exactly
go
to
ask
student
for
their
fa
password
so
it
s
get
to
be
something
else
maybe
there
s
a
single
username
password
combo
that
all
of
lowell
know
that
seem
a
little
hard
to
manage
since
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
webmaster
to
tell
lowell
resident
how
to
figure
out
the
username
and
password
without
give
them
away
completely
and
you
do
want
people
to
know
what
kind
of
authentication
be
necessary
so
it
s
probably
not
that
either
so
what
do
each
student
have
that
can
be
use
for
authentication
that
the
house
webmaster
have
access
to
student
id
s
anyone
suspicion
affirm
time
to
get
myself
a
match
name
and
student
id
combo
for
lowell
and
i
m
in
but
there
be
more
problem
the
picture
be
separate
into
a
bunch
of
different
page
and
i
m
way
too
lazy
to
go
through
all
of
them
and
save
each
one
write
a
perl
script
to
take
care
of
that
seem
like
the
right
answer
indeed
it
be
hack
at
its
most
fundamental
like
a
cryptographer
work
out
of
some
cave
to
defeat
the
nazi
code
by
now
mark
s
computer
be
fill
up
with
picture
pretty
soon
he
d
have
half
the
house
photo
database
in
his
hand
every
girl
on
campus
except
the
freshman
under
his
control
in
his
laptop
little
electronic
byte
and
bit
that
represent
all
those
pretty
and
not
so
pretty
face
blonde
and
brunette
and
redhead
big
breast
and
small
tall
and
short
all
of
them
every
girl
this
be
go
to
be
fantastic
be
adam
have
no
security
but
limit
the
number
of
result
to
a
page
all
i
need
to
do
be
break
out
the
same
script
i
just
use
on
lowell
and
we
re
set
house
by
house
name
by
alphabetical
name
he
be
collect
them
all
be
quincy
have
no
online
facebook
what
a
sham
nothing
i
can
do
about
that
be
dunster
be
intense
not
only
be
there
no
public
directory
but
there
s
no
directory
at
all
you
have
to
do
search
and
if
your
search
return
more
than
match
nothing
get
return
and
once
you
do
get
result
they
don
t
link
directly
to
the
image
they
link
to
a
php
that
redirects
or
something
weird
this
may
be
difficult
i
ll
come
back
later
the
house
he
couldn
t
get
through
right
away
he
d
most
likely
figure
out
later
there
be
no
wall
that
he
couldn
t
climb
harvard
be
the
premier
university
in
the
world
but
it
be
no
match
for
mark
zuckerberg
for
his
computer
be
leverett
be
a
little
well
they
still
make
you
search
but
you
can
do
an
empty
search
and
get
link
to
page
with
every
student
s
picture
it
s
slightly
obnoxious
that
they
only
let
you
view
one
picture
at
a
time
and
there
s
no
way
i
m
go
to
go
to
page
to
download
pic
one
at
a
time
so
it
s
definitely
necessary
to
break
out
emacs
and
modify
that
perl
script
this
time
it
s
go
to
look
at
the
directory
and
figure
out
what
page
it
need
to
go
to
by
find
link
with
regexes
then
it
ll
just
go
to
all
of
the
page
it
found
link
to
and
jack
the
image
from
them
it
s
take
a
few
try
to
compile
the
script
another
beck
s
be
in
order
mark
be
most
likely
wide
awake
now
deep
into
the
process
he
didn
t
care
what
time
it
be
or
how
late
it
get
to
guy
like
mark
time
be
another
weapon
of
the
establishment
like
alphabetical
order
the
great
engineer
hacker
they
didn
t
function
under
the
same
time
constraint
as
everyone
else
be
mather
be
basically
the
same
as
leverett
except
they
break
their
directory
down
into
class
there
aren
t
any
freshman
in
their
facebook
how
weak
and
on
and
on
he
go
into
the
night
by
four
a
m
it
seem
as
though
he
have
go
as
far
as
he
could
go
download
thousand
of
photo
from
the
house
database
it
be
likely
that
there
be
a
few
house
that
weren
t
accessible
online
from
his
james
bond
like
lair
in
kirkland
house
you
probably
need
an
ip
address
from
within
these
house
to
get
at
them
but
it
be
also
likely
that
mark
knew
how
to
do
that
it
would
just
take
a
little
legwork
in
a
few
day
he
could
have
everything
he
need
once
he
have
all
the
data
he
d
just
have
to
write
the
algorithm
complex
mathematical
program
to
make
the
web
site
work
then
the
program
itself
it
would
take
a
day
maybe
two
at
the
most
he
be
go
to
call
the
site
facemash
com
and
it
be
go
to
be
beautiful
perhaps
harvard
will
squelch
it
for
legal
reason
without
realize
its
value
as
a
venture
that
could
possibly
be
expand
to
other
school
maybe
even
one
with
good
look
people
but
one
thing
be
certain
and
it
s
that
i
m
a
jerk
for
make
this
site
oh
well
someone
have
to
do
it
eventually
maybe
grin
as
he
down
the
rest
of
his
beck
s
he
spell
out
the
introduction
that
would
greet
everyone
who
go
to
the
site
when
he
finally
launch
it
be
we
let
in
for
our
look
no
will
we
be
judged
on
them
yes
yes
it
be
go
to
be
fuck
beautiful
if
you
be
to
ask
the
right
computer
hacker
what
might
have
happen
next
that
frigid
fall
night
in
cambridge
the
answer
seem
fairly
clear
base
on
the
blog
he
create
document
his
thought
process
as
he
create
facemash
one
can
surmise
what
might
have
follow
maybe
there
be
other
explanation
but
we
know
there
be
certain
house
mark
be
have
trouble
hack
into
he
might
have
gotten
what
he
need
in
other
way
we
certainly
don
t
know
for
sure
every
detail
but
we
can
imagine
how
it
might
have
go
down
a
harvard
residence
house
the
middle
of
the
night
a
kid
who
knew
a
lot
about
computer
security
and
how
to
get
around
it
a
kid
who
live
outside
the
great
churn
hormonal
world
of
college
life
maybe
a
kid
who
want
inside
or
maybe
a
kid
who
just
like
to
prove
what
he
could
do
how
much
smarter
he
be
than
everybody
else
imagine
the
kid
crouch
in
the
dark
down
real
low
hand
and
knee
low
curl
up
in
a
deep
crouch
behind
a
velvet
couch
the
carpet
beneath
his
finger
and
flip
flop
be
plush
and
crimson
but
most
of
the
rest
of
the
room
be
just
shadow
a
twenty
by
twenty
cavern
of
shape
and
silhouette
maybe
the
kid
isn
t
alone
maybe
two
of
the
shape
be
people
a
guy
and
a
girl
position
by
the
far
wall
right
between
the
window
that
look
out
onto
the
house
s
courtyard
from
his
position
behind
the
couch
the
kid
wouldn
t
have
be
able
to
tell
if
they
be
sophomore
junior
or
senior
but
he
would
have
know
they
be
trespass
just
like
he
be
the
third
floor
parlor
isn
t
exactly
off
limit
but
normally
you
need
a
key
to
get
inside
the
kid
didn
t
have
a
key
he
d
just
time
it
perfectly
wait
outside
the
door
on
the
third
floor
land
for
the
janitor
to
finish
with
the
carpet
and
the
window
and
then
just
at
the
right
moment
as
the
man
packed
up
his
gear
and
walk
out
lunge
inside
leave
a
textbook
lever
in
the
door
frame
the
guy
and
the
girl
on
the
other
hand
have
just
gotten
lucky
they
d
probably
notice
the
door
propped
open
and
curiosity
have
driven
them
forward
as
we
imagine
it
the
kid
have
ducked
behind
the
couch
just
in
time
not
that
the
couple
be
go
to
notice
him
they
have
other
thing
on
their
mind
at
the
moment
the
guy
have
the
girl
back
against
the
wall
her
leather
jacket
open
and
her
sweatshirt
up
all
the
way
past
her
collarbone
the
guy
s
hand
be
move
up
her
flat
naked
stomach
and
she
arch
her
back
his
lip
touch
the
side
of
her
throat
she
seem
about
to
give
in
to
him
right
then
and
there
but
thankfully
something
make
her
change
her
mind
she
let
him
go
a
second
longer
then
push
him
away
and
laugh
then
she
grab
his
hand
and
drag
him
back
across
the
room
toward
the
door
they
pas
right
by
the
couch
but
neither
of
them
look
in
the
kid
s
direction
by
the
time
the
girl
reach
the
doorway
and
push
the
door
open
the
guy
have
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
he
half
carry
her
out
into
the
hall
the
door
swing
back
against
the
textbook
and
for
a
brief
second
the
kid
think
the
textbook
be
go
to
slip
out
and
he
ll
be
lock
inside
all
night
thankfully
the
book
hold
and
finally
the
kid
be
alone
with
the
shadow
and
the
silhouette
we
imagine
him
slip
out
from
behind
the
couch
and
continue
what
he
d
be
do
before
he
d
be
interrupt
he
begin
prowl
around
the
perimeter
of
the
room
his
knee
slightly
bent
as
he
scan
the
dark
wall
especially
the
area
right
down
by
the
mold
it
take
another
few
minute
to
find
what
he
s
look
for
and
then
he
grin
reach
for
the
small
backpack
that
be
slung
over
his
left
shoulder
he
get
down
on
his
knee
as
he
open
the
backpack
his
finger
find
the
little
sony
laptop
inside
and
he
yank
the
device
free
an
ethernet
cable
be
already
attach
to
the
sony
swing
free
and
pendulant
as
he
power
the
machine
up
with
expert
ease
he
catch
the
end
of
the
cable
and
jam
it
into
the
port
in
the
wall
a
few
inch
above
the
plaster
mold
with
quick
flick
of
his
finger
against
the
computer
s
keyboard
he
engages
the
program
he
d
write
just
a
few
hour
ago
and
watch
as
the
laptop
screen
blink
up
at
him
with
him
we
can
almost
imagine
the
tiny
packet
of
electrical
information
siphon
upward
through
the
cable
tiny
pulse
of
pure
energy
cull
from
the
electronic
soul
of
the
building
itself
the
second
tick
by
as
the
laptop
whir
in
near
silent
gluttony
and
every
now
and
then
the
kid
glance
behind
himself
make
sure
the
room
be
still
empty
his
heart
be
no
doubt
pound
and
we
can
imagine
the
tiny
rivulet
of
sweat
trickle
down
the
small
of
his
back
we
don
t
think
this
be
the
first
time
he
s
do
something
like
this
but
the
adrenaline
high
be
always
the
same
it
must
feel
like
james
bond
kind
of
shit
somewhere
in
the
back
of
the
kid
s
mind
he
must
know
that
what
he
be
do
be
probably
illegal
certainly
against
school
rule
but
it
isn
t
exactly
murder
one
as
hack
go
it
isn
t
even
shoplift
he
isn
t
steal
money
from
a
bank
or
hack
into
some
defense
department
web
site
he
isn
t
fuck
with
some
power
company
s
grid
or
even
track
some
ex
girlfriend
s
e
mail
consider
what
a
highly
train
hacker
such
as
himself
be
truly
capable
of
he
be
hardly
do
anything
at
all
just
take
a
few
picture
off
of
a
house
database
that
s
all
well
maybe
not
just
a
few
picture
all
of
them
and
maybe
it
be
a
private
database
one
that
you
be
suppose
to
have
a
password
to
access
and
an
ip
address
from
this
particular
building
along
with
that
password
to
comb
through
okay
it
isn
t
totally
innocent
but
it
isn
t
a
capital
crime
and
in
the
kid
s
mind
it
be
certainly
for
the
great
good
a
few
more
minute
and
he
ll
be
do
the
great
good
freedom
of
information
and
all
that
crap
to
him
we
believe
it
be
part
of
a
true
moral
code
kind
of
an
extension
of
the
hacker
s
creed
if
there
s
a
wall
you
find
a
way
to
knock
it
down
or
crawl
over
it
if
there
s
a
fence
you
cut
your
way
through
the
people
who
built
the
wall
the
establishment
they
be
the
bad
guy
the
kid
be
the
good
guy
fight
the
good
fight
information
be
meant
to
be
share
picture
be
meant
to
be
look
at
a
minute
later
a
tiny
electronic
beep
emerges
from
the
laptop
signal
that
the
job
be
finish
the
kid
pop
the
ethernet
cable
out
of
the
wall
and
jam
the
laptop
back
into
his
backpack
this
house
down
maybe
two
house
to
go
we
almost
hear
the
james
bond
theme
run
through
the
kid
s
head
he
sling
the
backpack
over
his
left
shoulder
and
hurry
toward
the
door
he
retrieves
the
textbook
slip
out
of
the
parlor
and
let
the
door
click
shut
behind
him
we
can
imagine
him
notice
as
he
go
that
the
girl
s
floral
perfume
still
hang
seductively
in
the
air
it
wasn
t
until
about
seventy
two
hour
later
that
mark
found
out
exactly
what
he
d
do
his
drunken
even
have
most
assuredly
long
since
subside
but
he
d
carry
through
with
what
he
d
start
even
while
he
d
go
on
about
his
life
go
to
his
computer
science
course
study
for
his
core
hang
with
eduardo
and
his
buddy
in
the
din
hall
later
on
he
d
tell
reporter
from
the
college
newspaper
that
he
hadn
t
even
thought
that
much
about
facemash
other
than
that
it
be
a
task
to
be
complete
a
mathematical
and
compute
problem
to
be
solve
and
when
he
d
do
that
perfectly
wonderfully
beautifully
finish
up
just
a
couple
of
hour
earlier
he
d
e
mail
it
to
a
few
of
his
buddy
to
see
what
they
thought
to
get
opinion
feedback
maybe
even
a
few
accolade
then
he
d
head
out
of
his
room
to
a
meeting
for
one
of
his
class
which
have
last
a
good
deal
longer
than
he
d
expect
by
the
time
he
d
gotten
back
to
his
dorm
in
kirkland
all
he
have
intend
to
do
be
drop
off
his
backpack
check
his
e
mail
and
head
down
to
the
din
hall
but
when
he
enter
his
bedroom
his
attention
immediately
slid
to
the
laptop
that
be
still
open
on
his
desk
to
his
surprise
the
screen
be
frozen
and
then
it
dawn
on
him
the
laptop
be
frozen
because
it
be
act
as
a
server
for
facemash
com
but
that
didn
t
make
any
sense
unless
holy
shit
before
he
left
for
the
meeting
he
have
e
mail
the
link
to
facemash
com
to
a
handful
of
friend

obviously
some
of
them
have
forward
it
along
to
their
friend
somewhere
along
the
way
it
have
picked
up
steam
of
its
own
from
the

to
go
out
like
that
he
d
later
explain
that
he
want
to
get
some
opinion
maybe
tweak
the
thing
a
bit
he
d
want
to
figure
out
what
the
legality
be
of
download
all
those
picture
maybe
he
d
never
have
launch
it
at
all
but
now
it
be
too
late
the
thing
about
the
internet
be
it
wasn
t
pencil
it
be
pen
you
put
something
out
there
you
couldn
t
erase
it

there
mark
lunge
forward
hit
key
on
the
desktop
use
password
to
get
inside
the
program
he
d
write
in
a
matter
of
minute
he
kill
the
damn
thing
shut
it
down
he
watch
as
his
laptop
screen
finally
go
blank
then
he
drop
down
into
his
chair
his
finger
tremble
he
have
a
feel
that
he
be
in
big
trouble
from
the
outside
the
four
story
hilles
building
look
more
like
a
crash
land
space
station
than
a
university
library
jutting
pillar
of
cement
and
stone
shiny
facade
of
glass
and
steel
like
the
rest
of
the
quad
the
quad
library
be
one
of
the
newer
building
on
campus
because
it
be
tucked
so
far
away
from
the
yard
and
its
age
ivy
cover
legacy
the
architect
have
probably
figure
they
could
get
away
with
just
about
anything
even
a
futuristic
monstrosity
that
seem
more
appropriate
for
the
mit
campus
down
the
street
at
the
moment
tyler
be
entombed
in
a
back
corner
on
the
third
floor
of
the
spaceship
his
six
foot
five
frame
jammed
into
a
chair
desk
combination
that
seem
almost
as
much
torture
device
as
a
piece
of
art
deco
furniture
he
d
chosen
the
chair
desk
monstrosity
specifically
because
it
be
uncomfortable
it
be
barely
seven
in
the
morning
on
a
monday
and
after
the
workout
he
d
just
have
it
be
go
to
take
extraordinary
measure
just
to
keep
himself
conscious
there
be
a
massive
economics
textbook
open
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
next
to
one
of
the
bright
red
plastic
tray
from
the
nearby
pforzheimer
house
din
hall
a
half
eat
bologna
sandwich
be
on
the
tray
partially
wrap
in
a
napkin
even
though
tyler
and
cameron
have
just
finish
breakfast
not
a
half
hour
ago
tyler
be
still
starve
the
textbook
be
the
reason
he
be
in
the
library
with
less
than
an
hour
to
go
before
his
econ
lecture
but
the
bologna
sandwich
be
the
only
thing
keep
him
awake
the
miss
half
of
the
sandwich
be
still
in
his
mouth
and
he
be
so
busy

they
d
be
freshman
roommate
as
well
put
together
supposedly
at
random
except
nobody
on
campus
really
believe
it
be

especially
since
someone
figure
out

the

of
the

article
the

blonde
have
be

it
have
cause
quite
a
stir
on

it
get
shut
down
pretty
fast
divya
continued
point
to
the

say
here
that
the
kid
who
make
it
shut
it
down
himself
when
he
create
the
site
he
didn
t
even
realize
people
be
go
to
get
mad
even
though
on
his
blog
he
talk
about
compare

to
farm
animal
tyler
lean
back
in
his

who
get
mad
well
girl
lot
of
them
the
feminist
group
on
campus
sent
dozen
of
letter
and
then
the
university
so
many
people
be
on
the
site
at
the
same
time
it
clog
up
the
university
s
bandwidth
professor
couldn
t
even
get
into
their
e
mail
account
it
be
a
righteous
mess
tyler
whistle
low
wow
yeah
wow
it
get
like
twenty
thousand
hit
in
twenty
minute
now
the
kid
who
create
it
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
seem
he
stole
all
the
picture
off
the
house
database
hack
in
and
just
download
em
all
him
and
a
few
of
his
friend
be
gonna
get
ad
board
tyler
knew
all
about
the
ad
board
the
administration
s
disciplinary
organization
usually
make
up
of
dean
and
student
adviser
sometimes
even
university
lawyer
and
the
high
administrator
themselves
tyler
have
a
friend
in
the
porc
who
d
be
accuse
of
cheat
on
a
history
exam
the
kid
have
have
to
go
up
in
front
of
two
dean
and
a
senior
tutor
the
ad
board
have
a
lot
of
power
it
could
suspend
you
even
call
for
expulsion
though
in
this
case
tyler
doubt
the
punishment
would
be
that
severe
the
kid
who
make
facemash
would
probably
end
up
get
probation
his
reputation
be
a
little
fuck
however
certainly
the
girl
on
campus
weren
t
go
to
be
think
too
highly
of
him
although
from
the
sound
of
it
the
kid
wasn
t
exactly
a
casanova
compare
farm
animal
to
girl
that
wasn
t
the
sort
of
thing
you
come
up
with
when
you
be
get
laid
regularly
say
here
it
s
not
his
first
program
cameron
say
leaf
through
the
article
he
write
that
course
match
thing
you
remember
tyler
that
online
schedule
to
pick
your
class
and
in
high
school
he
be
supposedly
some
sort
of
megahacker
tyler
felt
the
energy
rise
inside
of
him
he
like
everything
he
be
hearing
this
kid
have
fuck
thing
up
with
his
web
site
but
he
be
obviously
a
brilliant
programmer
and
definitely
a
freethinker
maybe
he
be
exactly
what
they
be
look
for
we
should
talk
to
this
kid
divya
nod
i
already
call
victor
he
say
the
kid
be
in
some
computer
science
class
with
him
he
warn
me
that
he
s
a
little
weird
though
weird
how
cameron
ask
you
know
like
kind
of
socially
autistic
tyler
look
at
cameron
they
knew
exactly
what
divya
meant
autistic
wasn
t
the
right
word
socially
awkward
probably
cover
it
there
be
dozen
of
kid
like
that
all
over
harvard
to
get
into
harvard
you
have
to
either
be
incredibly
well
round
like
a
straight
a
student
who
be
also
the
captain
of
a
varsity
sport
or
you
have
to
be
really
really
really
good
at
one
thing
maybe
well
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
like
a
virtuoso
violinist
or
an
award
win
poet
tyler
like
to
think
that
he
and
his
brother
be
well
round
but
he
wasn
t
go
to
fool
himself
he
also
knew
that
they
be
really
really
really
good
at
crew
this
kid
be
obviously
really
really
really
good
at

because
it
sound
like
he
sure
as

wasn

nothing

precisely
the

the

thing
that
eduardo
be
that
those

have
probably
heard
of

maybe
read
about
it
in
the

or
see
something
post
on
one
of
the

maybe
the

be
even
aware
that
just
an
hour
before
mark
have
be
force
to
sit
down

three
dean
not
to

a

make
to
apologize
again
and
again
for
the
mess
he
have
inadvertently
cause
the
funny
thing
although
the
dean
hadn

exactly
see
the
humor
in
it
be
that
mark
hadn
t
seem
to
really
understand
why
anyone
be
so
upset
in
the
first
place
yes
he
d
hack
into
the
university
s
computer
and
he
d
download
picture
he
knew
that
be
wrong
and
he
d
certainly
apologize
for
it
but
he
be
truly
confuse
by
the
anger
that
have
be
direct
toward
him
by
the
various
female
group
on

not
just
the

by
the

themselves
many
of
whom
have
sent
e
mail
letter
and
sometimes
boy
friend
to
get
the
message
across
in
the
din
hall
in
the
classroom
even
in
the
library
stack
wherever
they
ran
across
mark
s
path
during
the
ad
board
meeting
he
d
readily
admit
his
guilt
in
term
of
the
hack
but
he
d
also
point
out
that
his
action
have
illuminate
some
serious
security
flaw
in
the
university
s
computer
system
his
stunt
have
a
silver
line
he
d
argue
and
he
d
readily
volunteer
to
help
the
house
fix
up
the
flaw
in
their
system
also
mark
have
gamely
point
out
that
he
d
shut
the
site
down
himself
when
he
d
realize
it
have
go
viral
he
d
never
have
any
intention
of
launch
facemash
across
the
campus
it
be
sort
of
a
beta
test
go
wild
a
stunt
and
he
hadn
t
meant
to
do
anything
malicious
with
the
web
site
frankly
mark
s
social
awkwardness
and
his
confusion
over
the
response
to
facemash
have
be
his
great
defense
the
gather
dean
have
look
at
him
and
listen
to
his
stilted
affectation
and
they
have
realize
that
mark
really
wasn
t
a
bad
kid
he
just
didn
t
think
the
same
way
other
kid
do
he
hadn
t
realize
that
girl
be
go
to
get
mad
because
guy
be
voting
on
their
appearance
hell
mark
and
eduardo
and
probably
every
other
college
guy
in
the
world
have
be
rank
female
classmate
in
term
of
hotness
since
the
dawn
of

education
eduardo
be
pretty
sure
that
someday
some
paleontologist
would
find
a
cave
draw
rank
neanderthal
girl
it
be
simply
human
nature
to
make
that
kind
of
list
to
an
outside
observer
it
seem
that
mark
hadn
t
realize
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
go
on
in
his
mind
the
sort
of
conversation
you
have
with
your

out

you
re
go

certainly
piss
a

the
dean
in
their
good
grace
have
decide
not
to
suspend
or
expel
him
over
facemash
they
d
give
mark
a
form
of
probation
really
they
d
simply
told
him
to
stay
out
of
trouble
for
the
next
two
year
or
else
they
hadn
t
clearly
define
what
or
else
meant
but
in
any
event
it
be
a
good
solid
slap
on
the
wrist
mark
have
survive
the
incident
without
much
damage
to
his
academic
stand
his
reputation
on
campus
however
hadn
t
gotten
off
quite
as
easily
if
he
d
have
trouble
get
girl
before
he
be
go
to
have
a
hell
of

have
make
sure
of
that
the
paper
have
even
follow
up
the
initial
article
about
the
facemash
debacle
with
an
editorial
about
facemash
s
popularity
and
how
the
very
number
of
hit
the
site
have
garner
show
that
there
be
interest
in
a
sort
of
online
picture
share
community
though
maybe
not
one
with
such
a
negative
bent
mark
have
certainly
stir
up
the
pot
that
be
something
wasn
t
it
when
the
two
freshman
girl
stroll
out
of
view
mark
reach
into
his
back
pocket
and

tyler
winklevoss
eduardo
read
through
the
e
mail
twice
digest
the
request
it
sound
like
these
kid
be
work
on
some
sort
of
secret
web
site
probably
they
have
read
about
mark
in
the
crimson
have
see
facemash
and
be
think
he
could
help
them
with
whatever
it
be
they
be
building
they
certainly
didn
t
know
mark
they
be
respond
to
his
reputation
his
sudden
notoriety
you
know
these
guy
mark
ask
i
don
t
know
divya
but
i
know
who
the
winklevoss
twin
be
they
re
senior
i
think
they
live
in
the
quad
they
row
crew
mark
nod
of
course
he
knew
the
winklevoss
twin
too
not
personally
of
course
but
you
couldn
t
avoid
have
notice
them
at
some
point
six
foot
five
identical
twin
be
kind
of
hard
to
miss
but
neither
eduardo
nor
mark
have
ever
exchange
a
word
with
the
two
jock
they
weren
t
exactly
wander
around
in
the
same
circle
tyler
and
cameron
be
porc
guy
they
be
athlete
and
they
hung
out
with
athlete
be
you
go
to
talk
to
them
why
not
eduardo
shrug
he
glance
at
the
e
mail
again
to
tell
the
truth
he
didn
t
have
a
great
feel
about
it
he
didn
t
know
the
winklevoss
twin
or
divya
but
he
knew
mark
and
he
couldn
t
imagine
mark
get
along
well
with
kid
like
that
it
take
a
certain
sort
of
understand
to
get
along
with
mark
in
the
long
run
and
guy
like
the
winklevosses
well
they
didn
t
understand
geek
like
eduardo
and
mark
sure
eduardo
be
make
great
ground
now
that
he
be
hang
out
at
the
phoenix
work
his
way
through
the
initiation
process
in
a
week
or
so
he
be
pretty
sure
that
process
would
end
and
he
d
become
a
full
fledge
final
club
member
but
there
be
a
vast
difference
between
be
a
member
of
the
phoenix
and
be
a
member
of
the
porcellian
the
phoenix
be
about
learn
how
to
talk
to
girl
drink
heavily
and
hopefully
get
laid
the
porcellian
be
about
learn
how
to
rule
the
world
i
d
say
fuck
em
eduardo
respond
you
don
t
need
them
mark
take
the
e
mail
back
and
shove
it
into
his
pocket
then
he
picked
at
his
shoelace
loosening
his
shoe
i
don
t
know
he
say
and
eduardo
could
tell
that
he
d
already
make
up
his
mind
maybe
the
idea
of
hang
out
with
guy
like
the
winklevoss
twin
appeal
to
something
inside
mark
or
maybe
it
be
just
another
lark
like
facemash
something
that
seem
like
it
could
be
amuse
or
as
mark
would
put
it
as
he
always
put
it
it
might
be
interest
oh
shit
lock
up
your
girlfriend
boy
look
who
s
come
to
dinner
tyler
and
cameron
be
halfway
through
the
kirkland
din
hall
move
between
the
table
at
a
near
jog
when
it
happen
tyler
saw
the
bull
shape
senior
come
toward
them
hand
outstretched
in
a
low
faux
tackle
a
sloppy
grin
above
those
wide
saggy
jowl
and
he
just
have
to
laugh
the
very
idea
that
they
could
get
through
the
meeting
at
the
river
house
without
be
notice
be
foolish
both
he
and
cameron
have
a
lot
of
friend
in
kirkland
include
a
few
member
of
the
porc
and
a
handful
of
crew
teammate
davis
mulroney
wasn
t
either
but
he
be
hard
to
avoid
consider
that
he
must
have
weigh
close
to
three
hundred
pound
played
center
on
the
varsity
football
team
and
now
he
be
come
right
at
them
tyler
feint
left
but
he
be
too
slow
and
davis
get
him
in
a
waist
high
bear
hug
lift
his
foot
off
the
floor
for
a
full
count
of
five
after
let
tyler
down
he
shook
both
brother
hand
then
cocked
a
bushy
eyebrow
at
them
slum
on
the
river
what
brings
you
boy
down
from
the
quad
tyler
glance
at
cameron
they
d
both
agree
that
it
be
well
for
now
to
keep
their
meeting
with
the
computer
kid
under
wrap
it
wasn
t
like
their
web
site
be
a
complete
secret
their
friend
knew
about
it
and
so
do
a
few
of
their
brother
at
the
porc
but
this
zuckerberg
kid
be
kind
of
a
flash
point
on
campus
at
the
moment
and
they
certainly
weren
t
ready
for
any
crimson
level
announcement
hell
they
hadn
t
even
met
the
kid
yet
but
they
do
know
he
be
very
interested
in
their
site
and
want
to
be
a
part
of
what
they
be
building
both
divya
and
victor
gua
have
trade
a
bunch
of
e
mail
with
the
kid
and
accord
to
them
zuckerberg
have
seem
really
interested
his
exact
word
in
one
of
his
recent
e
mail
make
it
sound
like
he
be
certainly
worth
the
trip
to
the
river
house
i
m
down
to
chat
but
i
need
to
deal
with
the
aftermath
of
facemash
so
maybe
tomorrow
i
m
definitely
interested
in
hearing
about
your
project
but
a
dinner
meeting
at
kirkland
wasn
t
the
same
as
a
full
partnership
and
tyler
didn
t
need
the
whole
campus
know
that
he
and
his
brother
be
work
with
the
facemash
kid
before
it
be
actually
true
still
it
be
foolish
to
think
that
he
and
his
brother
could
march
into
kirkland
without
run
into
a
handful
of
friend
davis
s
girlfriend
be
roommate
with
one
of
cameron
s
ex
and
anyway
football
and
crew
have
similar
workout
schedule
so
they
be
always
run
into
each
other
we
heard
it
be
sloppy
joe
night
tyler
respond
we
re
always
up
for
a
good
sloppy
joe
davis
laugh
he
gesture
toward
a
table
near
the
window
which
be
fill
with
rather
large
look
guy
in
match
harvard
athletic
sweatshirt
why
don
t
you
join
us
we
re
gonna
grab
a
drink
afterward
at
the
spi
maybe
head
down
to
grafton
my
buddy
have
some
chick
come
in
on
the
fuck
truck
from
wellesley
should
be
a
good
time
tyler
roll
his
eye
the
fuck
truck
be
a
harvard
institution
a
vanlike
bus
that
travel
between
the
harvard
campus
and
a
half
dozen
of
the
nearby
all
girl
school
as
well
as
a
few
of
the
more
liberal
mind
coed
party
campus
shuttle
kid
back
and
forth
most
often
on
weekend
all
socially
knowledgeable
harvard
grad
have
be
on
the
fuck
truck
at
least
once
in
their
college
career
tyler
could
close
his
eye
and
still
remember
the
wonderfully
thick
scent
of
alcohol
and
perfume
that
seem
to
permeate
the
bus
s
vinyl
seat
but
tonight
he
wasn
t
interested
in
the
fuck
truck
or
its
content
sorry
man
can
t
tonight
but
maybe
a
rain
check
he
give
the
big
kid
a
pat
on
the
shoulder
wave
at
the
table
of
jock
then
kept
on
move
through
the
din
hall
as
he
go
he
couldn
t
help
think
that
in
some
way
the
fuck
truck
be
analogous
to
the
project
he
and
his
brother
be
work
on
the
harvard
connection
would
have
feature
that
could
be
described
as
an
electronic
fuck
truck
a
superslick
connection
between
guy
and
girl
but
instead
of
a
long
ride
in
the
back
of
a
bus
you
d
just
have
to
click
a
key
on
your
laptop
one
stop
shopping
as
it
be
for
that
coed
of
your
dream
cameron
tapped
his
arm
and
point
toward
a
table
at
the
very
back
of
the
rectangular
hall
in
the
center
of
the
table
a
kid
be
wave
at
them
the
kid
be
lanky
and
have
a
mop
of
curly
brownish
blond
hair
he
be
wear
a
zippy
and
cargo
short
even
though
it
be
thirty
degree
outside
and
his
cheek
have
a
certain
ivory
pallor
to
them
as
if
he
hadn
t
be
in
the
sun
in
a
long
time
there
be
another
kid
at
the
table
with
him
a
short
dark
haired
guy
with
scruff
on
his
chin
maybe
the
kid
s
roommate
but
that
one
take
off
as
they
approach
leave
mark
by
himself
tyler
reach
the
table
first
hold
out
his
hand
tyler
winklevoss
this
be
my
brother
cameron
sorry
divya
couldn
t
make
it
he
have
a
seminar
he
couldn
t
get
out
of
mark
s
hand
felt
like
a
dead
fish
in
his
grip
tyler
drop
into
a
seat
across
the
table
from
him
and
cameron
take
the
seat
to
tyler
s
right
mark
didn
t
look
like
he
be
go
to
say
anything
so
tyler
start
right
in
we
re
gonna
call
it
harvard
connection
he
begin
get
right
to
the
point
then
he
launch
into
a
full
description
of
the
web
site
they
be
try
to
build
he
try
to
keep
it
simple
at
first
explain
the
idea
behind
an
online
meeting
place
where
harvard
guy
and
girl
could
find
each
other
share
information
connect
that
the
site
would
have
two
section
one
for
date
and
one
for
connect
student
would
be
able
to
post
picture
of
themselves
put
in
some
personal
info
and
try
to
find
link
with
one
another
then
he
get
into
the
ideology
behind
the
site
the
thought
that
there
be
an
inefficiency
in
the
way
people
met
each
other
how
there
be
so
many
obstacle
to
find
the
perfect
person
how
the
harvard
connection
could
bring
people
together
base
on
their
personality
or
whatever
they
put
online
rather
than
on
their
proximity
although
it
be
hard
to
read
the
kid
s
face
it
seem
like
mark
get
the
idea
right
away
he
like
the
concept
of
a
web
site
to
meet
girl
and
he
be
certain
that
the
program
wasn
t
go
to
be
too
difficult
for
him
he
ask
how
far
along
victor
have
gotten
with
the
code
and
cameron
suggest
that
he
could
see
for
himself
they
would
give
mark
the
necessary
password
to
go
inside
victor
s
work
and
he
could
even
download
the
code
so
he
could
work
on
it
from
his
own
computer
cameron
guess
they
be
talk
about
ten
maybe
fifteen
hour
of
program
left
to
do
no
heavy
lift
for
a
guy
like
mark
cameron
go
into
more
detail
as
tyler
lean
back
in
his
chair
watch
as
the
kid
listen
he
could
see
that
mark
be
get
more
and
more
excite
about
the
idea
as
his
brother
talk
the
awkwardness
in
him
seem
less
apparent
the
more
into
the
computer
stuff
they
get
and
unlike
the
other
computer
science
type
they
d
spoken
to
mark
seem
to
share
the
energy
and
vision
that
tyler
and
his
brother
have
brought
to
the
table
still
tyler
knew
that
the
kid
would
want
to
know
what
be
in
it
for
him
if
he
make
the
site
work
so
tyler
jumped
into
it
as
soon
as
his
brother
quiet
down
if
this
site
be
successful
we
re
all
go
to
make
money
he
say
but
more
than
the
money
this
be
go
to
be
very
cool
for
all
of
us
and
we
want
you
to
be
the
centerpiece
of
it
all
this
will
get
you
back
in
the
crimson
but
this
time
the
paper
be
go
to
be
praise
you
not
trash
you
the
offer
be
pretty
simple
in
tyler
s
view
they
d
be
partner
in
the
project
so
if
it
make
any
money
they
d
all
do
well
but
until
then
mark
could
use
the
launch
of
the
web
site
to
rehabilitate
his
image
and
he
could
be
the
center
of
attention
something
that
computer
guy
never
really
get
as
they
be
often
shove
into
the
background
and
use
the
site
however
he
want
to
well
his
social
situation
look
at
the
kid
alone
in
the
back
of
his
din
hall
obviously
awkward
as
if
uncomfortable
in
his
own
skin
tyler
knew
that
it
have
to
be
a
seductive
thought
get
the
site
go
get
a
little
famous
because
of
it
who
know
maybe
it
would
make
this
kid
a
whole
different
person
give
him
a
social
life
break
him
out
of
the
geeky
mold
get
him
in
with
the
type
of
girl
you
couldn
t
get
hang
out
in
a
computer
lab
tyler
didn
t
know
the
kid
at
all
but
who
wouldn
t
respond
to
an
offer
like
that
by
the
time
the
meeting
be
over
tyler
knew
that
the
kid
be
hooked
when
they
shook
hand
again
it
be
less
dead
fish
and
more
lively
engineer
and
tyler
head
away
from
the
table
thrill
to
have
finally
make
contact
with
someone
who
seem
to
really
understand
what
they
be
try
to
do
he
be
so
thrill
in
fact
that
he
decide
he
and
his
brother
do
have
time
to
join
the
football
kid
for
one
drink
at
the
spi
the
harvard
connection
be
one
step
closer
to
reality
maybe
it
be
time
for
a
little
celebrate
and
what
could
be
more
fitting
a
celebration
than
a
visit
from
the
fuck
truck
on
a
good
day
the
fierce
aroma
of
roast
garlic
and
parmesan
cheese
waft
out
of
the
chrome
and
glass
open
kitchen
would
have
be
titillate
if
a
little
overwhelm
but
today
be
anything
but
a
good
day
eduardo
s
head
be
throb
and
his
eye
burn
like
they
d
be
dipped
in
bleach
the
aroma
be
choke
him
and
he
want
nothing
more
than
to
crawl
underneath
the
table
in
the
small
booth
where
he
be
sit
curl
up
into
a
ball
on
the
floor
and
drift
off
into
a
coma
instead
he
take
deep
sip
from
the
glass
of
ice
water
he
have
in
front
of
him
and
try
to
make
sense
of
the
blur
word
spread
across
the
small
menu
in
his
hand
he
didn
t
blame
the
restaurant
for
his
physical
state
cambridge
be
one
of
his
favorite
eatery
in
harvard
square
and
usually
he
look
forward
to
their
thick
pile
on
pizza
you
could
smell
cambridge
from
two
block
down
church
street
and
there
be
a
good
reason
every
booth
in
the
modern
little
place
be
fill
as
well
as
every
seat
at
the
small
bar
that
sidle
up
next
to
the
open
kitchen
but
at
the
moment
eduardo
have
no
interest
in
pizza
the
very
thought
of
food
threaten
his
fragile
equilibrium
and
he
fought
the
urge
to
sprint
back
to
his
dorm
room
cover
himself
in
his
blanket
and
disappear
for
the
next
two
day
he
could
have
gotten
away
with
it
too
it
be
only
a
week
into
january
and
he
hadn
t
even
start
class
yet
after
the
two
week
winter
break
in
fact
he
d
only
gotten
back
onto
campus
from
miami
the
day
before
after
land
at
logan
he
d
head
directly
over
to
the
phoenix
really
to
decompress
after
so
much
family
time
eduardo
have
return
to
campus
need
a
mind
cleanse
experience
and
he
d
have
no
trouble
find
one
at
the
phoenix
he
d
also
found
a
few
of
his
fellow
new
member
there
and
they
d
thrown
thing
right
into
high
gear
it
be
almost
as
if
they
be
try
to
re
create
the
damage
that
have
be
do
the
night
of
their
initiation
into
the
club
which
have
occur
just
ten
day
earlier
eduardo
grin
even
through
his
pain
as
he
thought
back
to
that
night
truly
one
of
the
craziest
of
his
life
it
have
start
innocuously
enough
dress
up
in
a
tuxedo
he
and
the
other
initiate
have
be
march
like
dapper
soldier
all
over
harvard
square
then
they
have
be
herd
back
to
the
mansion
on
mt
auburn
street
and
brought
into
the
upper
living
room
of
the
clubhouse
the
ritual
have
kick
off
with
an
old
fashion
boat
race
the
initiate
have
be
divide
into
two
group
line
up
in
front
of
the
pool
table
and
the
first
kid
in
each
group
have
be
hand
a
bottle
of
jack
daniel
s
one
of
the
club
member
have
blown
a
whistle
and
the
race
have
begin
each
initiate
have
be
told
to
drink
as
much
as
he
could
then
pas
the
bottle
back
to
the
next
kid
in
line
sadly
eduardo
s
team
hadn
t
won
the
race
and
as
punishment
they
d
have
to
reenact
the
damn
thing
with
an
even
big
bottle
of
vodka
after
that
eduardo
s
memory
of
the
night
be
kind
of
blurry
but
he
do
remember
be
march
out
to
the
river
still
wear
his
tux
he
remember
how
fuck
cold
it
be
stand
there
in
his
thin
little
jacket
the
december
wind
whip
through
his
expensive
white
shirt
then
he
remember
the
brother
tell
him
and
the
other
initiate
that
they
be
go
to
race
again
except
this
time
it
be
go
to
be
a
swim
race
across
the
charles
and
back
eduardo
have
nearly
faint
at
the
idea
the
charles
be
notoriously
pollute
and
even
bad
in
the
middle
of
december
it
be
already
start
to
ice
in
some
place
try
to
swim
across
sober
be
terrify
enough
but
drunk
still
eduardo
hadn
t
have
a
choice
the
phoenix
meant
too
much
to
him
to
turn
back
then
so
like
the
other
initiate
he
d
go
to
work
on
his
shoe
and
sock
then
he
d
line
up
right
at
the
water
s
edge
lean
forward
and
thank
god
that
s
when
the
brother
have
all
come
out
of
the
darkness
laugh
and
cheer
there
wasn
t
go
to
be
any
swim
that
night
just
more
drinking
more
ritual
and
congratulation
all
around
within
a
few
hour
the
initiation
be
complete
and
eduardo
become
an
official
member
of
the
phoenix
he
be
now
free
to
wander
the
upstairs
hall
and
private
room
of
the
club
free
to
get
acquaint
with
the
nook
and
cranny
of
the
mansion
where
he
d
be
spending
so
much
of
his
social
life
go
forward
to
his
surprise
last
night
he
d
discover
that
there
be
even
bedroom
upstairs
in
the
club
even
though
nobody
actually
live
there
he
could
guess
what
the
bedroom
be
for
and
the
thought
have
lead
to
many
more
toast
with
his
club
mate
which
have
lead
to
the
terrify
state
he
be
in
now
so
bad
in
fact
that
he
be
halfway
out
of
the
booth
and
head
for
the
door
when
he
finally
spot
mark
wind
past
the
crowd
bar
his
hoody
up
over
his
head
a
strange
determine
glow
in
his
eye
eduardo
immediately
decide
he
could
fight
the
pain
for
a
few
minute
at
least
it
wasn
t
often
he
d
see
that
look
in
mark
s
eye
and
it
could
only
mean
something
interest
be
about
to
go
down
something
at
the
very
least
that
would
explain
why
they
be
meeting
in
an
italian
restaurant
instead
of
in
the
din
hall
where
they
usually
ate
lunch
mark
slid
into
the
booth
across
from
eduardo
just
as
eduardo
reposition
himself
back
behind
his
ice
water
and
his
menu
but
from
the
look
on
mark
s
face
he
didn
t
think
they
d
be
order
anything
soon
mark
seem
to
be
bursting
at
the
seam
i
think
i
ve
come
up
with
something
he
start
and
then
he
launch
right
into
it
over
the
past
month
begin
right
after
the
facemash
incident
mark
have
be
develop
an
idea
it
have
really
start
with
facemash
itself
not
the
web
site
per
se
but
the
frenzied
interest
that
mark
have
witness
firsthand
simply
put
people
have
react
to
the
site
in
drove
it
wasn
t
just
that
mark
have
put
up
picture
of
hot
girl
onto
the
internet
there
be
a
million
place
people
could
go
to
see
picture
of
hot
girl
but
facemash
have
offer
up
picture
of
girl
whom
the
kid
at
harvard
knew
sometimes
personally
the
fact
that
so
many
people
have
clicked
onto
the
site
and
vote
show
that
there
be
real
interest
in
check
out
classmate
in
an
informal
online
set
well
mark
wonder
if
people
want
to
go
online
and
check
out
their
friend
couldn
t
they
build
a
web
site
that
offer
exactly
that
an
online
community
of
friend
of
picture
profile
whatever
that
you
could
click
into
visit
browse
around
a
sort
of
social
network
but
one
that
be
exclusive
in
that
you
have
to
know
the
people
on
the
site
to
get
into
it
kind
of
like
in
the
real
world
real
social
circle
but
put
online
by
the
people
in
the
social
circle
themselves
unlike
facemash
he
want
to
create
a
web
site
where
people
put
their
own
picture
up
and
not
just
picture
but
also
profile
where
they
d
grown
up
how
old
they
be
what
they
be
interested
in
maybe
the
class
they
be
take
what
they
be
look
for
online
friendship
love
interest
whatever
and
then
he
want
to
give
people
the
ability
to
invite
their
friend
to
join
punch
them
in
a
way
and
invite
them
into
your
online
social
circle
i
m
think
we
keep
it
simple
and
call
it
the
facebook
mark
say
and
his
eye
be
positively
on
fire
eduardo
blink
his
hangover
suddenly
forgotten
right
away
he
thought
it
be
a
pretty
amaze
idea
it
felt
big
even
though
aspect
of
it
certainly
sound
familiar
there
be
a
web
site
call
friendster
that
seem
similar
but
it
be
pretty
clunky
and
nobody
use
it
at
least
not
at
harvard
and
some
kid
name
aaron
greenspan
on
campus
have
gotten
in
trouble
a
few
month
before
for
get
kid
to
join
an
info
share
bb
that
have
use
their
harvard
e
mail
and
id
as
password
then
the
greenspan
kid
have
go
on
to
develop
something
call
house
system
that
have
some
social
element
involve
in
it
grossman
have
even
add
a
universal
house
facebook
into
his
site
which
mark
have
checked
out
hardly
anyone
have
paid
any
attention
to
it
as
far
as
eduardo
knew
friendster
wasn
t
exclusive
the
way
mark
be
describe
his
idea
and
grossman
s
site
wasn
t
particularly
slick
and
wasn
t
about
picture
and
profile
mark
s
idea
be
really
different
it
be
about
move
your
real
social
network
onto
the
web
isn
t
the
school
work
on
some
sort
of
online
facebook
eduardo
also
remember
reading
in
the
crimson
article
on
facemash
that
the
university
actually
do
have
plan
in
place
to
make
some
sort
of
universal
online
student
picture
site
other
school
already
have
them
a
sort
of
repository
for
school
photo
and
such
yeah
but
what
they
re
do
isn
t
interactive
or
anything
it
s
not
what
i
m
talk
about
at
all
and
the
facebook
be
a
pretty
generic
name
i
don
t
think
it
matter
where
else
it
s
be
use
interactive
an
interactive
social
network
it
sound
pretty
compelling
it
also
sound
like
a
lot
of
work
but
eduardo
wasn
t
a
computer
expert
that
be
mark
s
department
if
mark
felt
he
could
build
such
a
site
well
then
he
could
and
it
seem
like
mark
have
already
do
a
lot
of
think
about
the
idea
it
be
pretty
developed
at
least
in
his
mind
eduardo
realize
it
be
more
than
just
facemash
it
also
incorporate
some
of
the
stuff
mark
have
do
with
course
match
where
kid
could
see
what
class
other
kid
have
take
friendster
of
course
must
have
fed
into
it
as
well
certainly
mark
have
checked
out
the
site
hadn
t
everybody
mark
must
have
take
all
those
thing
combine
them
in
his
head
and
then
take
it
all
a
step
far
eduardo
wonder
when
the
genius
moment
have
struck
while
mark
be
home
in
dobbs
ferry
over
the
holiday
while
he
be
sit
alone
in
his
dorm
room
star
at
his
computer
screen
in
class
the
one
place
he
be
pretty
sure
mark
didn
t
have
the
stroke
of
genius
be
while
hang
out
with
the
winklevoss
twin
mark
have
described
the
dinner
meeting
in
full
detail
as
well
as
the
site
the
winklevosses
thought
mark
be
work
on
for
them
the
way
mark
have
described
it
it
be
little
more
than
a
date
web
site
a
place
for
guy
to
try
to
get
laid
a
sort
of
highbrow
match
com
as
far
as
eduardo
knew
mark
hadn
t
actually
do
any
work
for
the
twin
he
d
look
at
their
site
thought
it
through
and
decide
it
wasn
t
worth
his
time
in
fact
he
d
scoffed
at
it
say
that
even
his
most
pathetic
friend
knew
more
about
get
people
interested
in
a
web
site
than
divya
and
the
winklevosses
anyway
he
be
too
busy
with
class
to
spend
time
play
with
a
date
site
just
to
impress
a
couple
of
porc
jock
though
eduardo
be
pretty
sure
mark
have
continued
to
converse
with
them
via
e
mail
and
even
phone
call
for
god
know
what
reason
probably
because
they
be
who
they
be
and
mark
be
who
he
be
eduardo
be
certain
the
winklevoss
twin
have
completely
misread
his
friend
they
d
probably
look
at
him
and
see
a
geek
who
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
rehabilitate
his
image
by
building
their
web
site
for
them
but
mark
didn
t
want
to
rehabilitate
anything
facemash
have
gotten
him
in
trouble
but
it
have
also
show
the
world
exactly
what
mark
have
want
to
show
that
he
be
smarter
than
everyone
else
he
d
beaten
harvard
s
computer
then
he
d
beaten
the
ad
board
certainly
mark
saw
himself
as
league
beyond
the
winklevoss
twin
who
be
they
to
try
to
harness
his
ability
just
a
couple
of
jock
who
thought
they
rule
the
world
maybe
they
do
rule
the
social
world
but
in
the
land
of
web
site
and
computer
mark
be
king
i
think
it
sound
great
eduardo
say
the
restaurant
have
recede
into
the
background
now
and
all
he
could
see
be
mark
s
passion
for
this
new
project
eduardo
want
to
be
involve
obviously
mark
want
his
involvement
as
well
otherwise
he
would
have
go
to
his
roommate
one
of
them
dustin
moskovitz
be
a
computer
genius
maybe
as
good
at
cod
as
mark
why
hadn
t
mark
go
to
him
first
there
have
to
be
a
reason
it
be
great
but
we
re
go
to
need
a
little
start
up
cash
to
rent
the
server
and
get
it
online
and
there
it
be
mark
need
money
to
get
his
site
go
eduardo
s
family
be
wealthy
and
more
than
that
eduardo
himself
have
money
the
three
hundred
thousand
dollar
he
d
make
trading
oil
future
the
profit
that
have
come
from
his
obsession
with
meteorology
and
the
algorithm
that
have
enable
him
to
predict
hurricane
pattern
eduardo
have
money
mark
need
money
maybe
it
be
as
simple
as
that
but
eduardo
want
to
believe
there
be
even
more
to
it
what
mark
be
talk
about
be
a
social
site
mark
have
no
social
skill
to
speak
of
and
really
no
social
life
either
eduardo
have
just
become
a
member
of
the
phoenix
he
be
start
to
branch
out
meet
girl
sooner
or
later
he
be
probably
even
go
to
get
laid
of
mark
s
friend
who
else
could
mark
have
turn
to
eduardo
be
certainly
the
most
social
of
the
bunch
i
m
in
eduardo
say
shake
mark
s
hand
across
the
table
he
could
provide
money
and
advice
he
could
help
guide
this
project
in
a
way
that
even
mark
probably
couldn
t
mark
wasn
t
a
business
mind
kid
hell
he
d
turn
down
seven
figure
from
microsoft
in
high
school
eduardo
have
grown
up
in
a
world
of
business
with
this
idea
perhaps
he
could
show
his
father
how
much
he
have
already
learn
the
head
of
the
harvard
investment
association
be
one
thing
create
a
popular
web
site
would
be
another
entirely
how
much
do
you
think
we
ll
need
eduardo
ask
i
think
a
thousand
dollar
to
start
the
thing
be
i
don
t
really
have
a
thousand
dollar
at
the
moment
but
if
you
put
up
what
you
can
right
now
we
can
get
this
thing
off
the
ground
eduardo
nod
he
knew
that
mark
wasn
t
rich
but
eduardo
could
have
a
thousand
buck
ready
in
less
than
twenty
minute
all
it
would
take
be
a
short
trip
over
to
the
near
bank
we
ll
split
the
company
seventy
thirty
mark
suddenly
volunteer
seventy
percent
for
me
thirty
percent
for
you
you
can
be
the
company
s
cfo
eduardo
nod
again
it
sound
fair
it
be
mark
s
idea
after
all
eduardo
would
finance
it
and
make
the
business
decision
maybe
they
d
never
make
any
money
off
the
thing
but
eduardo
have
a
feel
it
be
too
good
an
idea
to
just
fizzle
away
kid
all
over
campus
be
try
to
build
web
site
not
just
the
winklevosses
and
that
greenspan
kid
eduardo
personally
knew
about
a
dozen
other
student
who
be
try
to
launch
online
business
from
their
dorm
room
lot
of
them
have
social
aspect
like
the
winklevosses
site
but
none
of
the
one
that
eduardo
have
heard
of
be
anything
as
cool
sound
as
mark
s
idea
simple
sexy
and
exclusive
the
facebook
have
all
the
element
of
a
successful
web
site
a
simple
idea
a
sexy
function
and
an
exclusive
feel
like
a
final
club
except
online
it
be
the
phoenix
but
you
could
join
from
the
privacy
of
your
own
dorm
room
and
this
time
mark
zuckerberg
wasn
t
go
to
just
get
punch
he
be
go
to
be
make
president
this
be
go
to
be
really
interest
eduardo
grin
mark
grin
right
back
at
him
the
door
be
huge
and
paint
pitch
black
right
across
mass
ave
from
an
even
large
more
ominous
stone
gate
complete
with
iron
bar
ornate
masonry
and
a
great
limestone
boar
s
head
carve
into
its
arch
pinnacle
there
be
no
way
any
freshman
who
walk
through
that
gate
glance
across
the
street
toward
that
door
didn
t
feel
at
least
a
tingle
of
curiosity
if
not
outright
paranoia
the
building
itself
might
have
be
nondescript
reddish
brick
rise
up
four
floor
above
an
austere
clothing
store
but
mass

be
a
place
of
harvard
myth
and
legend
an
address
intertwine
with
the
secret
history
of
the
university
itself
at
the
moment
tyler
winklevoss
his
brother
cameron
and
their
best
friend
divya

just
be

they
would
have

than
two

arguably
the

at

in

of

porc

that
if
a

member
hadn
t
make
his
first
million
by
the
age
of
thirty
the

simply
give
it
to
him
whether

to
contemplate
the
path
to
their
first
million
they
be
there
to
commiserate
because
suddenly
success
seem
more
distant
than
ever
the
reason
for
their
frustrate
state
have
a
name
mark
zuckerberg
for
two
month
since
that
seemingly
wonderful
meeting
of
the
mind
in
the
kirkland
house
din
hall
the
kid
have
be
tell
them
that
their
partnership
in
the
harvard
connection
be
go
great
he
d
look
over
their
computer
code
study
what
they
d
already
built
of
the
site
and
be
ready
to
do
his
part
to
get
it
up
and
run
fifty
two
e
mail
between
mark
the
winklevosses
and
divya
a
half
dozen
phone
call
and
always
the
kid
have
seem
as
thrill
and
excite
about
the
project
as
he
have
be
during
that
first
dinner
meeting
his
e
mail
have
be
like
a
work
log
to
the
winklevosses
progress
report
that
they
thought
indicate
the
program
be
move
steadily
along
if
a
little
slow
than
expect
most
of
the
cod

by
the
end
of
the
seventh

when
no

ready
to
get
the

by
the
end
of

finish
the
job

but
the
response
have
be
a
request
for
more
time
sorry
it
s
take
me
a
while
to
get
back
to
you
i
m
completely
swamp
with
work
this
week
i
have
three
program
project
and
a
final
paper
due
monday
as
well
as
a
couple
problem
set
due
friday
but
in
the
same
e
mail
mark
have
let
them
know
that
he
be
still
work
on
the
site
as
much
as
he
could
as
far
as
the
site
go
for
now
i
ve
make
some
of
the
change
although
not
all
of
them
and
they
seem
to
be
work
on
my
computer
i
have
not
uploaded
them
to
the
live
site
yet
though
and
then
he
d
add
something
that
have
cause
tyler
a
little
concern
because
it
seem
out
of
the
blue
consider
how
upbeat
mark
have
seem
until
then
i
m
still
a
little
skeptical
that
we
have
enough
functionality
in
the
site
to
really
draw
the
attention
and
gain
the
critical
mass
necessary
to
get
a
site
like
this
to
run
and
in
its
current
state
if
the
site
do
get
the
type
of
traffic
we
re
look
for
i
don
t
know
if
we
have
enough
bandwidth
from
the
isp
you
re
use
to
handle
the
load
without
some
serious
optimization
which
will
take
a
few
more
day
to
implement
it
be
the
first
time
mark
have
mention
anything
about
the
site
not
have
functionality
up
until
then
he
have
seem
thrill
with
their
idea
and
have
agree
that
it
would
be
a
great
success
after
that
e
mail
tyler
have
be
insistent
put
the
pressure
on
the
kid
to
meet
with
them
he
have
hop
that
the
site
would
be
ready
to
go
online
by
now
and
every
day
they
waste
be
a
day
that
someone
else
could
beat
them
to
the
punch
get
a
good
similar
site
up
and
run
tyler
and
cameron
be
senior
they
want
to
see
their
project
happen
as
soon
as
possible
but
mark
have
kept
postpone
claim
he
have
too
much
schoolwork
to
schedule
anything
it
wasn
t
until
that
very
night
just
a
few
hour
before
the
winklevosses
and
divya
have
cross
through
the
porcellian
gate
donate
to
harvard
by
the
club
in
and
enter
that
pitch
black
door
that
mark
have
finally
acquiesce
to
a
brief
get
together
in
the
kirkland
din
hall
at
first
when
tyler
cameron
and
divya
have
join
the
kid
at
the
same
back
table
it
have
seem
just
like
before
the
kid
compliment
them
on
their
idea
told
them
how
great
he
thought
the
harvard
connection
be
go
to
be
but
then
out
of
nowhere
he
d
start
to
hedge
a
bit
explain
that
he
didn
t
have
time
to
get
much
do
right
away
that
he
have
a
lot
of
other
project
that
be
take
up
a
lot
of
his
free
hour
tyler
assume
he
be
talk
about
project
for
his
computer
class
but
mark
be
be
very
vague
very
unclear
he
also
have
brought
up
a
few
problem
he
be
have
with
the
harvard
connection
that
he
d
never
mention
before
that
there
be
some
front
end
stuff
that
need
to
be
do
and
that
he
wasn
t
good
at
that
by
front
end
stuff
tyler
assume
he
meant
the
visual
aspect
of
the
front
page
which
seem
strange
because
that
be
exactly
what
mark
have
show
himself
to
be
very
talented
at
with
the
facemash
debacle
then
mark
have
gotten
even
more
confuse
state
that
some
of
the
work
he
still
need
to
do
to
get
the
site
live
be
boring
stuff
he
wasn
t
interested
in
do
he
again
reiterate
that
the
site
be
lack
functionality
that
they
be
go
to
need
more
server
capacity
tyler
have
suddenly
gotten
the
feel
that
the
kid
be
try
to
deflate
their
balloon
where
he
have
be
enthusiastic
before
now
he
be
try
to
tell
them
that
it
just
wasn
t
that
excite
to
him
tyler
have
wonder
maybe
the
kid
be
just
burning
out
a
bit
he
be
work
hard
with
all
his
class
and
tyler
knew
from
victor
that
engineer
have
a
tendency
to
get
like
that
a
little
burn
out
a
little
tire
a
little
testy
the
kid
s
excuse
seem
pretty
hollow
that
be
for
sure
server
problem
so
they
d
get
more
server
front
end
issue
anyone
could
design
the
front
end
maybe
he
just
need
some
time
left
alone
then
he
d
get
right
back
to
work
maybe
by
february
he
would
be
enthusiastic
again
still
it
be
extremely
frustrate
and
tyler
cameron
and
divya
have
come
out
of
the
meeting
utterly
depressed
after
all
those
week
of
tell
them
that
everything
be
go
along
fine
now
mark
be
tell
them
it
wasn
t
ready
to
go
that
there
be
some
real
issue
he
be
deal
with
that
he
wasn
t
that
excite
anymore
no
real
explanation
other
than
schoolwork
nothing
more
than
a
lame
apology
and
another
two
month
waste
it
be
beyond
disappoint
tyler
have
really
thought
the
site
would
be
ready
to
be
launch
by
now
he
d
really
thought
the
geeky
kid
have
gotten
their
project
understood
the
possibility
the
kid
have
see
what
they
d
already
do
have
agree
that
it
would
be
easy
to
finish
maybe
ten
fifteen
hour
of
work
for
a
competent
computer
programmer
but
now
all
this
garbage
about
front
end
and
server
capacity
it
didn
t
make
any
sense
tyler
have
ultimately
decide
that
the
best
course
of
action
be
to
leave
the
kid
alone
for
a
few
week
maybe
he
d
be
back
to
his
old
self
and
if
he
doesn
t
get
it
together
in
a
few
week
divya
ask
as
they
sat
on
the
couch
in
the
bicycle
room
they
could
hear
car
drive
by
on
mass
ave
on
the
other
side
of
the
black
door
if
tyler
and
cameron
have
go
upstairs
they
could
have
watch
the
traffic
through
a
mirror
design
specifically
so
that
nobody
could
see
them
watch
but
tyler
have
never
be
much
of
a
voyeur
he
want
to
participate
to
be
a
part
of
thing
to
move
forward
he
hat
be
stall
just
watch
as
the
rest
of
the
world
go
by
tyler
shrug
he
didn
t
want
to
get
ahead
of
himself
but
maybe
they
have
read
the
kid
wrong
maybe
mark
zuckerberg
wasn
t
the
entrepreneur
tyler
have
thought
he
be
maybe
zuckerberg
be
just
another
computer
geek
without
any
real
vision
if
that
happens
tyler
glumly
respond
we
have
to
find
ourselves
a
new
programmer
one
that
understands
the
big
picture
maybe
mark
zuckerberg
didn
t
get
it
at
all
eduardo
have
be
stand
in
the
empty
hallway
in
kirkland
house
a
good
twenty
minute
before
mark
finally
burst
out
of
the
stairwell
that
lead
down
toward
the
din
hall
mark
be
move
fast
his
flip
flop
a
blur
beneath
his
foot
the
hood
of
his
yellow
fleece
hoody
flap
behind
his
head
like
a
halo
in
a
hurricane
eduardo
watch
his
friend
careen
forward
cross
his
arm
against
his
chest
i
thought
we
be
suppose
to
meet
at
nine
eduardo
start
but
mark
wave
him
off
can
t
talk
he
mumble
as
he
dug
his
key
out
of
his
short
and
go
to
work
on
the
doorknob
eduardo
take
in
his
friend
s
wild
hair
and
even
wilder
eye
you
haven
t
slept
yet
have
you
mark
didn
t
respond
the
truth
be
eduardo
be
pretty
sure
mark
hadn
t
slept
much
in
the
past
week
he
have
be
work
round
the
clock
light
to
dark
to
light
he
look
beyond
exhaust
but
it
didn
t
matter
at
the
moment
nothing
matter
to
mark
he
be
in
that
pure
laser
mode
that
every
engineer
understood
he
refuse
to
suffer
any
distraction
anything
that
could
jar
the
single
thought
loose
why
can
t
you
talk
eduardo
continued
but
mark
ignore
him
finally
the
key
clicked
and
mark
get
the
door
open
dive
inside
his
flip
flop
caught
in
a
pair
of
jean
that
be
ball
up
on
the
floor
and
he
momentarily
lose
his
balance
spin
past
a
clutter
bookshelf
and
a
small
color
television
then
he
be
back
on
his
foot
and
still
move
forward
he
launch
himself
into
his
bedroom
beelining
straight
to
his
desk
the
desktop
computer
be
on
the
program
open
and
mark
go
straight
to
work
he
didn
t
seem
to
hear
eduardo
plod
across
the
room
behind
him
he
hit
the
key
furiously
his
finger
move
like
they
be
possess
he
be
add
a
final
touch
eduardo
assume
because
all
the
debug
have
be
finish
by
three
and
most
of
the
design
and
cod
be
already
finish
the
only
thing
that
have
be
miss
have
be
a
function
that
mark
have
be
mull
over
for
nearly
a
day
he
d
be
play
around
with
the
feature
of
the
site
try
to
keep
the
design
as
simple
and
clean
as
possible
while
provide
enough
pizzazz
to
draw
a
viewer
s
attention
it
wasn
t
just
voyeurism
that
be
go
to
drive
people
to
use
thefacebook
it
be
the
interactivity
of
that
voyeurism
or
to
put
it
more
simply
it
be
go
to
mimic
what
go
on
at
college
every
day
the
thing
that
drove
the
college
social
experience
drove
people
to
go
out
to
the
club
and
bar
and
even
the
classroom
and
din
hall
to
meet
people
socialize
converse
sure
but
the
catalyst
of
it
all
the
burning
engine
behind
those
social
network
be
as
simple
and
basic
as
humanity
itself
that
look
pretty
good
eduardo
say
reading
over
mark
s
shoulder

nod
mostly
to
himself
yes
no
i
mean
that
s
great
that
look
great
i
think
people
be
go
to
really
respond
to
this
mark
rubbed
a
hand
through
his

lean
back
in
his

correct
the

be
key
in
eduardo
s
mind
you
have
to
be
a
harvard
student
to
join
the
site
mark
and
eduardo
knew
that
exclusivity
would
make
the
site
more
popular
it
would
also
enhance
the
idea
that
your
info
would
remain
in
a
close
system
private
privacy
be
important
people
want
to
have
control
of
what
they
put
onto
the

likewise
choose
your
own
password
be
integral
that
aaron
greenspan
kid
have
gotten
into
so
much
trouble
for
have
student
use
their
harvard
id
number
and
system
password
to
log
onto
his

mark
have
even
e
mail
with
him
about
his
experience
the
trouble
he
d
have
with
the
ad
board
greenspan
have
immediately
try
to
get
mark
to
partner
up
with
him
just
like
the
winklevoss
twin
and
their
harvard
connection
date
site
everyone
want
a
piece
of
mark
but
mark
didn
t
need
anyone
else
everything
he
need
be
right
in
front
of
him
and
what
s
that
at
the
bottom
eduardo
be
lean
forward
squint
to
read
a
small
line
of
print
a
mark
zuckerberg
production
the
line
would
appear
on
every
page
right
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen
mark
s
signature
for
everyone
to
see
if
eduardo
have
a
problem
with
that
he
didn
t
say
anything
and
why
should
he
mark
have
be
work
so
hard
the
hour
must
have
blend
together
in
one
blur
of
pure
program
he
have
barely
eat
barely
slept
it
seem
like
he
have
miss
almost
half
of
his
class
and
have
probably
be
in
real
danger
of
screw
up
his
grade
point
average
in
one
class
one
of
his
stupid
core
call
art
in
the
time
of
augustus
he
d
supposedly
fall
so
far
behind
that
he
d
almost
forgotten
about
an
exam
that
be
go
to
be
worth
a
large
percentage
of
his
overall
grade
he
d
have
no
time
to
study
for
the
damn
thing
so
he
d
reportedly
figure
out
a
unique
way
of
deal
with
the
situation
he
d
create
a
quick
little
web
site
where
he
post
all
the
artwork
that
be
go
to
be
on
the
exam
and
invite
people
in
the
class
to
comment
effectively
create
an
online
crib
sheet
for
the
test
he
d
essentially
gotten
the
rest
of
the
class
to
do
the
work
for
him
and
he
d
ace
the
exam
save
his
grade
and
now
sit
here
in
front
of
mark
s
creation
it
seem
like
all
the
work
have
paid
off
the
web
site
be
pretty
much
do
they
have
register
the
domain
name
thefacebook
com
a
couple
of
week
ago
january
they
d
book
the
server
around
eighty
five
buck
a
month
from
a
company
in
upstate
new
york
they
d
take
care
of
any
web
traffic
and
maintenance
mark
have
obviously
learn
his
lesson
from
the
facemash
incident
he
didn
t
need
any
more
frozen
laptop
the
server
could
handle
a
pretty
large
amount
of
traffic
so
there
wouldn
t
be
any
problem
with
the
site
freeze
up
even
if
the
thing
be
as
popular
as
facemash
have
be
everything
be
in
place
thefacebook
com
be
ready
to
roll
let
s
do
this
mark
point
to
his
laptop
which
be
open
on
the
desk
next
to
his
desktop
computer
eduardo
move
beside
him
hunch
over
the
laptop
keyboard
his
slop
shoulder
curve
inward
as
he
attack
the
key
he
quickly
open
his
e
mail
address
book
and
point
to
a
bunch
of
name
grouped
together
near
the
top
these
guy
be
all
member
of
the
phoenix
if
we
send
it
to
them
it
will
get
spread
around
pretty
fast
mark
nod
it
have
be
eduardo
s
idea
to
go
to
the
phoenix
member
first
they
be
the
social
star
on
campus
after
all
and
thefacebook
be
a
social
network
if
these
kid
like
it
and
sent
it
on
to
their
friend
it
would
spread
pretty
fast
and
these
phoenix
guy
knew
lot
of
girl
if
mark
have
simply
try
to
send
it
out
to
his
own
e
mail
list
it
would
bounce
around
the
computer
science
department
and
the
jewish
fraternity
of
course
certainly
it
wouldn
t
get
to
many
if
any
girl
and
that
would
be
a
problem
the
phoenix
be
a
much
well
idea
that
along
with
the
kirk
land
house
e
mail
list
which
mark
have
legal
access
to
as
a
member
of
the
house
would
get
this
thing
start
right
okay
eduardo
say
with
a
quaver
in
his
voice
here
we
go
he
write
a
simple
e
mail
just
a
couple
line
of
text
introduce
the
site
and
link
in
thefacebook
com
then
he
take
a
deep
breath
and
hit
the
key
send
out
the
mass
e
mail
with
a
single
stroke
of
his
finger
it
be
do
eduardo
close
his
eye
imagine
the
tiny
packet
of
information
ricochet
out
into
the
world
whiz
down
copper
tube
and
bounce
off
of
orbit
satellite
rip
through
the
ether
tiny
burst
of
electric
genius
leap
from
computer
to
computer
like
synaptic
flash
in
a
vast
worldwide
nervous
system
the
web
site
be
out
there
live
alive
eduardo
put
a
hand
on
mark
s
shoulder
startle
him
let
s
get
a
drink
it
s
time
to
celebrate
no
i
m
go
to
stay
here
you
sure
i
hear
there
be
some
girl
come
over
to
the
phoenix
later
they
sent
the
fuck
truck
for
em
mark
didn
t
respond
at
the
moment
eduardo
could
tell
from
mark
s
expression
that
he
be
a
distraction
like
the
sound
of
the
radiator
near
the
wall
or
the
traffic
in
the
street
down
below
his
little
window
you
re
go
to
just
stay
here
and
stare
at
the
computer
screen
again
mark
didn
t
answer
he
be
bobbing
a
little
behind
the
computer
davening
even
it
be
a
strange
sight
but
eduardo
obviously
decide
not
to
judge
his
awkward
friend
and
why
should
he
mark
have
be
work
round
the
clock
to
get
thefacebook
ready
for
this
launch
if
he
want
to
sit
by
himself
and
stare
he
d
earn
the
right
eduardo
back
away
from
him
cross
the
small
bedroom
in
near
silence
then
he
pause
at
the
doorway
tap
the
door
frame
with
his
outstretched
finger
mark
still
didn
t
turn
around
eduardo
shrug
turn
and
left
the
kid
alone
with
his
computer
mark
sat
there
envelop
in
silence
lose
in
his
own
reflection
as
it
dance
across
the
screen
tyler
be
in
the
zone
eye
close
muscle
ripple
across
his
back
chest
heave
quad
and
triceps
and

burning

white
against
the
oar
the
blade
slice
in
and
out
of
the
water
without
so
much
as
a
ripple
mimicked
exactly
by
cameron
s
pair
just
a
few
foot
behind
utterly
in
sync
again
and
again
and
again
tyler
could
almost
hear
the
cheer
of
the
fan
who
packed
the
bank
of
the
charles
he
could
almost
see
that
bridge
come
closer
and
closer
and
closer
tyler
you
ve
get
to
see
this
and
it
all
come
crash
down
his
oar
wobble
in
his
grip
and
the
water
splash
upward
soak
his
sweatshirt
and
short
his
eye
whip
open
and
he
didn
t
see
the
bank
of
the
charles
flash
by
he
saw
the
interior
of
the
newell
boathouse
home
to
harvard
s
crew
team
since
he
saw
a
cavernous
hall
like
room
wall
line
with
ancient
crew
memorabilia
oar
and
hull
and
sweatshirt
frame
black

foot
in
front
of
him
hold
up
a

blink
then
let
his
oar
down
and
wipe
water
from

back
at

connection
but
in
his
mind
it
wasn
t
that
different
either
the
harvard
connection
be
go
to
be
about
search
out
people
base
on
interest
and
it
be
go
to
be
center
on
the
domain
of
harvard
have
zuckerberg
just
take
their
idea
and
run
with
it
could
it
be
a
coincidence
have
he
be
meaning
to
work
on
their
site
but
have
just
gotten
carry
away
with
his
own
no
it
didn
t
seem
right
to
tyler
it
seem
like
theft
from
what
i
hear
he
get
some
financing
from
one
of
his
buddy
a
brazilian
kid
name
eduardo
saverin
he
s
in
the
phoenix
make
some
money
trading
stock
over
the
summer
now
he
s
part
owner
of
the
site
because
he
paid
for
it
i
guess
why
didn
t
mark
come
to
us
mark
assuredly
knew
that
the
winklevosses
have
money
he
must
have
know
they
be
in
the
porc
and
everyone
knew
what
that
meant
if
he
d
need
cash
to
start
a
site
he
could
easily
have
mention
it
to
tyler
or
cameron
unless
the
thing
he
need
cash
for
be
something
he
have
steal
from
them
unless
the
web
site
he
be
work
on
have
to
be
kept
secret
from
them
because
it
be
too
similar
to
what
they
have
hire
him
to
do
well
not
hire
exactly
they
have
never
talk
about
pay
him
just
that
he
d
benefit
if
they
benefit
there
have
be
no
contract
no
paperwork
nothing
but
a
handshake
here
and
there
fuck
tyler
lower
his
head
star
at
the
blue
green
water
in
the
row
tank
why
hadn
t
they
write
something
up
even
just
some
bullshit
one
pager
you
do
this
we
ll
do
that
something
simple
instead
they
d
just
trust
the
kid
now
it
seem
to
tyler
like
he
d
fuck
them
over
he
d
stall
them
lead
them
on
then
launch
his
own
site
with
similar
feature
here
s
the
best
part
divya
say
back
to
reading
from
the
crimson
zuckerberg
say
that
he
hop
the
privacy
option
would
help
to
restore
his
reputation
follow
student
outrage
over
facemash
com
a
website
he
create
in
the
fall
semester
tyler
slam
one
of
the
oar
with
his
palm
send
a
plume
of
water
splash
up
out
of
the
tank
almost
the
exact
word
of
his
pitch
to
mark
that
the
harvard
connection
would
restore
his
reputation
and
mark
have
use
them
right
there
in
the
crimson
it
be
almost
as
if
mark
be
mock
them
in
tyler
s
view
he
d
strung
them
along
for
two
month
right
through
the
holiday
and
the
winter
reading
period
all
the
while
work
on
his
own
web
site
then
he
d
blown
them
off
and
barely
two
week
later
launch
his
own
site
thefacebook
com
steal
their
thunder
and
in
tyler
s
mind
the
essence
of
their
idea
what
be
we
go
to
do
cameron
ask
tyler
wasn
t
sure
but
he
knew
he
couldn
t
just
let
it
happen
he
couldn
t
let
that
fuck
weasel
get
away
with
it
first
we
re
go
to
make
a
phone
call
tyler
s
mind
work
furiously
as
he
held
the
phone
hard
against
his
ear
he
be
stand
in
his
dorm
room
in
pforzheimer

soak
wet
from
a
hasty

over

and
a
pair
of

loose
around
his
waist
cameron
and
divya
be
at
his
desk
a
few
foot
away
surf
through
zuckerberg
s
site
on
tyler
s
desktop
computer
every
time
tyler
glance
toward
them
and
saw
that
blue
border
screen
his
cheek
heat
up
and
fire
spark
behind
his
eye
this
wasn
t
right
damn
it
this
wasn
t
fair
his
dad
finally
answer
on
the
third
ring
there
be
no
one
in
the
world
tyler
respect
more
his
father
a
self
make
multimillionaire
ran
one
of
the
most
successful
consult
company
on
wall
street
if
anyone
be
go
to
know
how
to
handle
a
difficult
situation
like
this
it
be
him
tyler
spoke
quickly
into
the
phone
explain
exactly
what
have
happen
his
dad
knew
all
about
the
harvard
connection
after
all
they
d
be
work
on
the
site
since
december
of
tyler
give
him
the
background
of
their
relationship
with
zuckerberg
then
told
him
what
he
d
read
in
the
crimson
and
what
he
cameron
and
divya
have
see
for
themselves
log
into
thefacebook
com
there
be
thing
that
seem
real
similar
dad
the
key
to
tyler
be
the
set
the
exclusivity
of
it
that
really
separate
what
mark
have
make
from
social
network
site
like
friendster
you
have
to
have
a
harvard
e
mail
to
enter
mark
s
site
and
that
have
be
their
idea
too
to
launch
a
harvard
centric
social
web
site
the
very
idea
of
make
everyone
who
join
have
an
edu
e
mail
address
be
completely
innovative
and
potentially
very
important
to
the
initial
success
of
the
site
it
be
sort
of
a
screen
process
that
kept
the
thing
exclusive
and
safe
maybe
a
lot
of
the
feature
mark
have
put
in
thefacebook
com
be
different
but
the
overall
concept
to
tyler
seem
too
similar
mark
have
met
with
them
three
time
they
have
exchange
fifty
two
e
mail
all
of
which
be
still
on
cameron
tyler
and
divya
s
computer
mark
have
look
at
their
code
which
they
could
prove
he
d
see
what
victor
have
already
do
and
have
talk
to
them
at
length
about
what
they
plan
to
do
it
isn
t
about
money
tyler
conclude
who
know
if
either
of
our
site
be
ever
go
to
make
any
money
but
this
just
isn
t
right
it
isn
t
fair
this
wasn
t
how
the
world
be
suppose
to
work
tyler
and
cameron
have
grown
up
believe
that
order
matter
rule
matter
you
work
hard
you
get
what
you
deserve
maybe
in
mark
s
hacker
world
his
computer
geek
worldview
thing
be
different
you
just
do
whatever
the
hell
you
want
you
launch
prank
site
like
facemash
you
hack
into
harvard
s
computer
you
thumbed
your
nose
at
authority
and
mocked
people
right
in
the
page
of
the
crimson
but
that
simply
wasn
t
acceptable
that
wasn
t
harvard
harvard
be
a
place
of
order
wasn
t
it
i
m
go
to
put
you
on
with
my
in
house
counsel
tyler
s
dad
say
tyler
nod
slow
his
breathing
force
calm
into
his
vein
a
lawyer
that
s
exactly
what
they
need
they
need
to
go
over
their
option
with
a
professional
see
what
could
be
do
maybe
it
wasn
t
too
late
maybe
just
maybe
they
could
still
make
this
right
from
up
above
the
man
look
tiny
and
hunch
behind
the
podium
his
face
just
a
little
too
close
to
the
microphone
and
his
lanky
shoulder
poked
out
at
the
corner
of
his
formless
beige
sweater
his
bowl
haircut
dribble
almost
to

of
his
splotchy
face
obscure
any
sense
of
expression
or
emotion
his
voice
reverberate
through
the
speaker
seem
a
little
too
high
and
nasal
and
sometimes
it
veer
into
a
monotone
drone
a
single
laryngeal
note
played
over
and
over
again
until
the
word
bleed
right
into
one
another
he
be
not
a
fantastic
speaker
and
yet
just
his
presence
the
mere
fact
that
he
be
stand
there
in
the
front
of
lowell
lecture
hall
with
his
pale
hand
flap
against
the
podium
his
turkey

eduardo
sat
next
to

in
the
back
row
of
the
balcony
watch
as

mesmerize
the
gather
crowd
despite
gate
s
strange
almost
autistic
mannerism
he
manage
to
toss
off
a
few
joke
one
about
why
he
d
drop
out
of
school
i
have
a
terrible
habit
of
not
go
to
class
and
certainly
some
pearl
of
wisdom
that
ai
be
the
future
that
the
next
bill
gate
be
out
there
possibly
in
that
very
room
but
eduardo
specifically
saw
mark
perk
up
when
gate
answer
a
question
from
one
of
the
audience
member
about
his
decision
to
leave
school
and
start
his
own
company
after
hem
and
haw
a
bit
gate
told
the
audience
that
the
great
thing
about
harvard
be
that
you
could
always
come
back
and
finish
the
way
mark
seem
to
smile
when
gate
say
it
make
eduardo
a
little
nervous
especially
consider
how
hard
mark
have
be
work
on
simply
keep
up
with
the
demand
of
their
nascent
web
site
eduardo
would
never
drop
out
of
school
it
simply
wasn
t
a
possibility
to
him
in
the
first
place
his
father
would
throw
a
fit
to
the
saverins
nothing
be
more
important
than
education
and
harvard
meant
nothing
if
you
didn
t
come
out
of
there
with
a
degree
second
eduardo
understood
that
entrepreneurship
meant
take
risk
but
only
to
a
certain
degree
you
didn
t
risk
your
entire
future
on
something
until
you
figure
out
how
it
be
go
to
make
you
rich
eduardo
be
so
busy
watch
mark
watch
gate
he
almost
didn
t
hear
the
giggle
come
from
the
seat
right
behind
him
he
might
not
have
turn
to
look
if
the
whisper
voice
that
follow
the
laughter
hadn
t
be
decidedly
female
as
gate
drone
on
answer
more
question
from
the
packed
crowd
eduardo
glance
over
his

be
empty

from

eduardo
could
see
wisp
of
her
red
lace
bra
wonderfully
offset
by
her
tan
smooth
skin
the
other
girl
be
in
an
equally
short
skirt
with
a

forward

to
mark

eduardo
saw
someone

want
the
benefit
that

itself
this
be
a
business
they
d
create
and
get

there
be
important
but
eduardo
didn
t
want
to
be
a
celebrity
because
of
it
and
it
be
begin
to
look
like

a
celebrity
be
a
real
possibility
though
thefacebook

be
up
and
run
only
for
a
short
time
it
be
really
change
life
at
harvard
it
be
insinuate
itself
into
everyone
s
routine
you
get
up
you
checked
your
facebook
account
to
see
who
have
invite
you
to
be
their
friend
and
which
of
your
invite
have
be
accepted
or
reject
then
you
go
about
your
business
when
you
get
home
if
there
be
a
girl
you
saw
in
one
of
your
class
or
even
just
somebody
you
d
met
in
the
din
hall
you
simply
search
for
her
on
facebook
then
invite
her
to
be
your
friend
maybe
you
add
some
little
message
about
how
you
d
met
or
what
you
saw
in
her
list
interest
that
jibed
with
one
of
your
own
or
maybe
you
just
invite
her
cold
no
message
just
to
see
if
she
knew
you
exist
when
she
open
her
account
she
d
see
your
invite
look
over
your
photo
and
maybe
accept
your
invitation
it
be
really
such
an
amaze
tool
lubricate
the
social
scene
make
everything
happen
so
much
faster
but
it
wasn
t
a
date
web
site
the
way
eduardo
saw
friendster
for
all
its
hype
as
a
social
network
friendster
and
myspace
which
be
just
begin
to
catch
fire
nationwide
be
really
just
about
search
through
people
you
didn
t
know
and
try
to
hook
up
with
them
the
difference
be
on
facebook
you
already
knew
the
people
you
invite
to
be
your
friend
you
might
not
know
them
well
but
you
knew
them
they
be
classmate
or
friend
of
friend
member
of
a
network
that
you
could
join
or
be
ask
to
join
by
people
you
knew
who
be
already
member
that
be
the
genius
of
it
all
mark
s
genius
really
but
eduardo
felt
he
be
a
part
of
that
as
well
he
d
put
up
the
money
for
the
server
but
he
d
also
have
a
hand
in
discuss
some
of
the
attribute
of
the
site
the
idea
behind
some
of
the
simplify
structure
what
neither
he
nor
mark
have
know
when
they
start
the
damn
thing
be
how
addictive
facebook
be
you
didn
t
just
visit
the
site
once
you
visit
it
every
day
you
come
back
again
and
again
add
to
your
site
your
profile
change
your
picture
your
interest
and
most
of
all
update
your
friend
it
really
have
move
a
large
portion
of
college
life
onto
the
internet
and
it
really
have
change
harvard
s
social
scene
but
that
didn
t
make
it
a
business
yet
just
a
highly
successful
novelty
eduardo
have
some
idea
about
that
and
after
the
lecture
he
and
mark
be
go
back
to
mark
s
room
to
discus
them
the
main
thing
he
want
to
push
mark
into
understand
be
that
it
be
time
to
start
chase
advertising
dollar
that
s
how
they
would
monetize
facebook
through
ad
eduardo
knew
it
be
go
to
be
a
tough
sell
mark
want
to
just
keep
it
as
a
fun
site
not
try
to
make
any
money
off
of
it
yet
but
then
again
he
be
the
kid
who
have
turn
down
a
million
buck
in
high
school
who
knew
if
he
d
ever
want
to
monetize
facebook
eduardo
have
a
different
worldview
facebook
be
cost
them
money
not
much
just
the
cost
of
the
server
but
as
more
people
join
in
surely
those
cost
would
go
up
the
thousand
dollar
eduardo
have
put
into
the
web
site
wasn
t
go
to
last
forever
until
the
company
have
some
sort
of
profit
model
until
they
could
figure
out
how
to
make
money
off
of
it
it
be
still
just
a
novelty
its
value
be
certainly
go
up
but
to
turn
that
value
into
cash
they
need
advertiser
they
need
a
business
model
they
need
to
sit
down
and
hash
it
all
out
most
of
all
mark
need
to
let
eduardo
do
what
he
do
best
think
big
very
nice
to
meet
you
eduardo

and
to
eduardo
thefacebook
seem
so
different
well
it
be
also
a
social
web
site
but
there
be
dozen
if
not
hundred
of
social
web
site
hell
every
computer
science
major
on
campus
have
a
social
web
site
under
development
that
aaron
greenspan
kid
have
even
call
part
of
his
networking
portal
the
facebook
or
something
like
that
do
that
mean
they
could
all
sue
one
another
just
for
have
similar
idea
i
talk
to
a
three
one
at
the
law
school
mark
say
i
sent
a
letter
back
and
another
one
to
the
school
under
that
next
book
eduardo
reach
for
another
computer
book
in
the
stack
on
the
tv
and
found
the
second
letter
this
one
write
by
mark
to
the
university
eduardo
skim
it
quickly
and
be
immediately
surprised
and
pleased
to
see
some
real
emotion
in
mark
s
response
to
the
winklevosses
claim
mark
have
told
the
university
in
no
uncertain
term
that
thefacebook
be
not
related
to
the
tiny
bit
of
work
he
d
do
for
the
winklevosses
originally
i
be
intrigue
by
the
project
and
be
ask
to
finish
the
connect
side
of
the
website
after
this
meeting
and
not
before
i
begin
work
on
thefacebook
use
none
of
the
same
code
nor
functionality
that
be
present
in
harvard
connection
this
be
a
separate
venture
and
do
not
draw
on
any
of
the
idea
discuss
in
our
meeting
furthermore
mark
felt
he
have
be
fool
by
the
initial
meeting
that
the
twin
have
misrepresent
what
they
want
him
to
do
from
the
initiation
of
this
project
i
perceive
it
as
a
non
business
orient
venture
with
its
primary
purpose
of
develop
an
interested
product
to
aid
the
harvard
community
i
realize
over
time
that
my
concept
of
the
web
site
be
not
as
it
have
initially
be
portrayed
and
what
s
more
mark
hadn
t
really
lead
them
on
at
all
when
we
met
in
january
i
express
my
doubt
about
the
site
where
it
stood
with
graphic
how
much
program
be
left
that
i
have
not
anticipate
the
lack
of
hardware
we
have
to
deal
with
the
lack
of
promotion
that
would
go
on
to
successfully
launch
the
web
site
etc
i
told
you
that
i
have
other
project
i
be
work
on
and
that
those
be
high
priority
than
finish
your
site
mark
have
conclude
that
he
be
appalled
to
find
himself
threaten
by
the
twin
because
of
a
few
meeting
in
the
kirkland
din
hall
and
some
e
mail
conversation
he
d
have
with
cameron
tyler
and
divya
and
that
he
saw
their
claim
as
an
annoyance
something
he
be
shrug
off
that
it
be
the
kind
of
unabashed
moneygrubbing
you
have
to
expect
when
you
make
something
successful
which
of
course
seem
a
little
over
the
top
to
eduardo
consider
that
thefacebook
wasn
t
make
anyone
any
money
and
the
winklevosses
be
hardly
hurt
for
cash
but
it
be
good
to
see
that
mark
have
stood
up
for
himself
eduardo
calm
down
a
bit
place
mark
s
letter
back
on
the
stack
of
computer
book
along
with
the
cease
and
desist
order
if
mark
wasn
t
scar
he
wasn
t
go
to
be
either
after
all
he
hadn
t
met
with
the
twin
he
wasn
t
a
computer
coder
and
he
could
only
go
by
what
mark
have
told
him
about
the
difference
between
the
two
web
site
the
way
mark
paint
it
it
be
like
one
furniture
maker
try
to
sue
someone
for
design
a
new
kind
of
chair
there
be
thousand
of
different
type
of
chair
and
make
one
didn
t
give
you
the
right
to
own
them
all
maybe
it
be
a
simplify
way
of
look
at
the
issue
but
fuck
it
they
be
college
kid
not
lawyer
the
last
thing
they
want
to
do
be
get
into
some
bullshit
legal
battle
over
a
web
site
that
be
perhaps
about
to
get
them
both
laid
their
name
be
kelly
and
alice
eduardo
start
but
before
he
could
finish
the
door
to
the
dorm
room
open
nearly
hit
eduardo
in
the
back
eduardo
turn
to
see
mark
s
two
roommate
enter
as
disparate
look
a
pair
of
college
kid
anyone
could
imagine
dustin
moskovitz
in
front
be
baby
face
and
dark
haired
with
thick
eyebrow
and
a
very
determine
look
in
his
equally
dark
eye
he
be
quiet
kind
of
withdrawn
an
economics
major
and
a
whiz
with
computer
also
incredibly
affable
a
truly
nice
guy
chris
hughes
be
the
far
more
flamboyant
of
the
two
shaggy
blond
hair
extroverted
outspoken
with
trace
of
a
southern
accent
from
his
upbringing
in
hickory
north
carolina
in
high
school
chris
have
be
president
of
the
young
democrat
society
and
could
easily
be
described
as
an
activist
on
a
number
of
liberal
issue
a
bit
of
a
fashionista
he
give
eduardo
a
run
for
the
most
presentable
of
the
group
though
where
eduardo
chose
conservative
blazer
and
tie
chris
favor
designer
shirt
and
pant
sometimes
mark
call
him
prada
because
of
the
way
he
look
the
four
of
them
together
mark
eduardo
dustin
and
chris
be
certainly
not
what
you
d
call
part
of
the
social
elite
at
harvard
in
fact
they
d
probably
be
outsider
at
any
college
not
just
the
home
to
rockefeller
and
roosevelt
they
be
all
geek
each
in
his
own
way
but
they
d
found
one
another
and
something
else
mark
start
the
conversation
because
it
be
something
he
d
already
decide
and
eduardo
be
rapidly
realize
that
that
s
the
way
thing
work
in
mark
s
world
thefacebook
be
grow
fast
and
mark
be
have
trouble
keep
up
with
it
all
he
be
in
real
danger
of
flunk
some
of
his
class
and
if
he
want
to
keep
thefacebook
grow
he
be
go
to
need
help
dustin
could
handle
the
computer
stuff
that
mark
couldn
t
do
himself
and
chris
be
a
talker
well
than
any
of
them
that
be
for
sure
so
he
could
take
charge
of
the
publicity
and
outreach
the
crimson
have
be
a
great
friend
so
far
it
turn
out
mark
have
do
some
it
work
for
the
student
paper
during
his
freshman
year
which
explain
all
the
glow
article
but
go
forward
they
be
go
to
need
to
keep
on
top
of
the
press
because
so
much
of
facebook
be
about
get
people
excite
interested
enough
to
log
on
eduardo
would
still
handle
the
business
side
of
thing
if
indeed
there
would
be
a
business
side
of
thing
the
four
of
them
would
be
the
team
to
take
facebook
to
the
next
level
and
they
be
all
go
to
have
title
eduardo
be
go
to
be
cfo
dustin
vice
president
and
head
of
program
chris
director
of
publicity
and
mark
founder
master
and
commander
and
enemy
of
the
state
mark
s
word
mark
s
sense
of
humor
eduardo
listen
to
it
all
contemplate
what
it
meant
he
knew
that
thing
have
be
much
simpler
when
it
be
just
him
and
mark
but
he
also
knew
that
run
a
company
meant
employee
and
they
didn
t
exactly
have
revenue
come
in
to
pay
for
people
s
help
so
the
only
option
be
add
more
partner
mark
s
roommate
be
smart
and
trustworthy
they
be
geek
just
like
him
and
this
be
a
dorm
room
operation
anyway
he
agree
to
the
new
leadership
and
he
also
agree
to
restructuring
their
ownership
agreement
dustin
would
get
around
percent
of
the
company
chris
would
get
a
percentage
that
would
be
more
fully
work
out
later
on
when
they
figure
out
how
much
work
he
d
be
do
mark
would
drop
his
ownership
down
to
percent
and
eduardo
would
own
percent
it
seem
more
than
fair
and
anyway
there
wasn
t
any
money
come
in
yet
so
why
haggle
over
percent
of
nothing
first
order
of
business
mark
say
when
that
be
settle
i
think
it
s
time
we
open
thefacebook
up
to
other
school
expansion
seem
like
the
natural
thing
they
d
conquer
harvard
it
be
time
to
see
how
much
farther
their
model
could
go
they
agree
to
begin
with
just
a
few
other
elite
school
yale
columbia
and
stanford
to
start
the
site
would
stay
exclusive
you
d
have
to
have
an
e
mail
address
from
one
of
those
school
to
join
eventually
the
community
could
get
big
and
they
d
allow
cross
college
pollination
facebook
have
to
keep
get
big
but
we
also
have
to
start
talk
to
advertiser
eduardo
chime
in
refuse
to
let
the
issue
go
we
need
to
start
monetize
this
mark
nod
but
eduardo
be
pretty
sure
he
didn
t
entirely
agree
mark
knew
they
should
try
to
make
enough
money
to
offset
the
server
cost
but
he
didn
t
seem
to
care
about
money
beyond
what
it
take
to
run
the
site
eduardo
felt
differently
eduardo
be
start
to
believe
in
his
heart
that
they
be
go
to
get
rich
from
this
web
site
as
he
look
around
the
room
at
the
team
of
ber
geek
they
d
assemble
it
seem
like
nothing
could
stand
in
their
way
four
hour
later
eduardo
s
heart
slam
in
his
chest
as
he
careen
forward
into
the
bathroom
stall
his
italian
leather
shoe
skid
against
the
tile
linoleum
floor
the
tall
slender
asian
girl
be
straddle
him
her
long
bare
leg
wrap
around
his
waist
her
skirt
rid
upward
her
lithe
body
arch
as
he
press
her
back
against
the
stall
his
hand
roam
under
her
open
white
shirt
trace
the
soft
material
of
her
red
bra
his
finger
linger
over
her
perky
round
breast
touch
the
silky
texture
of
her
perfect
caramel
skin
she
gasped
her
lip
closing
against
the
side
of
his
neck
her
tongue
leap
out
taste
him
his
entire
body
start
to
quiver
and
he
rock
forward
push
her
harder
against
the
stall
feel
her
writhe
into
him
his
lip
found
her
ear
and
she
gasped
again
and
then
another
sound
reverberate
through
the
bathroom
something
slam
against
the
stall
s
wall
from
the
other
side
of
the
cold
aluminum
then
a
curse
follow
by
laughter
a
second
later
the
laughter
stop
replace
by
soft
moan
and
the
sound
of
lip
against
lip
eduardo
grin
now
he
and
mark
share
more
than
a
web
site
they
also
share
an
experience
the
men
s
room
of
a
dorm
building
wasn
t
exactly
the
stack
at
widener
library
but
it
be
something
as
eduardo
go
back
to
the
girl
wrap
around
his
waist
bolster
by
the
music
of
his
friend
get
crazy
in
the
stall
next
to
him
a
thought
hit
him
and
he
couldn
t
stop
smile
they
have
groupie
and
beyond
that
he
realize
he
have
be
very
wrong
about
something
a
computer
program
could
actually
get
you
laid
the
woman
behind
the
reception
desk
be
try
not
to
stare
she
be
pretend
to
fidget
with
her
rolodex
her
finger
parse
through
the
switch
of
laminate
paper
as
her
bun
of
dark
hair
bobbed
up
and
down
but
every
now
and
then
tyler
could
see
it
that
quick
flick
of
her
pale
green
eye
she
couldn
t
help
look
at
them
sit
next
to
each
other
on
the
uncomfortable
couch
in
the
wait
area
in
front
of
her
desk
tyler
didn
t
blame
her
she
look
almost
as
tire
as
the
building
itself
and
if
he
and
his
identical
twin
brother
could
provide
a
little
entertainment
for
the
poor
overwork
woman
then
it
be
their
good
deed
for
the
day
hell
if
he
d
have
thought
it
would
help
them
with
the
task
ahead
he
and
cameron
would
have
dress
exactly
the
same
like
when
they
be
toddler
though
show
up
to
the
harvard
university
president
s
office
in
strip
pajama
and
a
beanie
might
have
seem
a
little
disrespectful
dark
blazer
and
tie
seem
more
appropriate
and
the
outer
office
receptionist
didn
t
seem
to
mind
at
least
she
couldn
t
stop
look
no
matter
how
hard
she
pretend
she
wasn
t
and
who
still
use
rolodex
anyways
the
truth
be
tyler
wasn
t
go
to
complain
about
any
form
of
attention
after
the
week
they
d
just
have
he
be
sick
and
tire
of
be
ignore
first
the
senior
tutor
of
pforzheimer
house
who
have
be
sympathetic
but
have
simply
pass
their
complaint
along
to
the
ad
board
s
office
then
the
ad
board
dean
who
d
also
seem
sympathetic
have
read
through
their
ten
page
complaint
against
zuckerberg
then
have
decide
that
for
whatever
reason
it
be
beyond
their
jurisdiction
and
zuckerberg
himself
who
d
respond
to
their
cease
and
desist
letter
with
a
bullshit
letter
of
his
own
zuckerberg
maintain
that
he
hadn
t
start
work
on
his
thefacebook
com
until
after
their
last
meeting
on
january
which
seem
odd
consider
that
he
d
register
the
domain
name
thefacebook
com
on
january
zuckerberg
have
also
maintain
that
he
d
just
be
try
to
help
out
fellow
student
for
free
out
of
his
own
generosity
and
that
their
site
be
nothing
like
his
the
kid
s
response
have
gotten
such
a
rise
out
of
tyler
and
his
partner
that
they
d
try
to
contact
mark
directly
they
d
go
back
and
forth
over
e
mail
and
on
the
phone
a
bit
try
to
get
him
to
meet
with
them
personally
at
one
point
he
d
agree
to
meet
but
for
some
reason
only
with
cameron
then
that
meeting
have
fall
through
and
all
contact
have
cease
which
to
tyler
seem
like
a
good
idea
because
he
didn
t
think
he
could
trust
mark
anyway
he
figure
that
if
in
his
opinion
mark
have
be
willing
to
lie
directly
to
his
face
why
would
a
meeting
do
any
good
so
here
they
be
sit
next
to
each
other
on
a
couch
that
felt
as
old
as
massachusetts
hall
itself
be
gawked
at
by
a
receptionist
to
tyler
everything
about
this
place
seem
ancient
indeed
mass
hall
built
in
be
the
old
building
in
harvard
yard
and
one
of
the
two
old
university
building
in
the
country
the
entrance
to
the
building
be
perpendicular
to
university
hall
where
the
legendary
statue
of
john
harvard
stood
the
statue

they
could
muster
simply

they

of
the
ultimate
power
on

it
be
hard
to
fight
off
a
loom
sense
of
dread
when
the
phone
on
the
receptionist
s
desk
burst
to

tyler
nearly
slid
off
the

then
glance
in
their
direction
the

see
you
now
she
point

like
to

about
a
complaint
we
recently
present
to
the
ad
board
which
they
decline
to
bring
forward
our
complaint
be
a
well
document
case
of
a
sophomore
student
who
broke
the
honor
code
with
respect
to
not
be
honest
and
forthright
in
his
deal
with
member
of
the
harvard
community
the
college
expect
that
all
student
will
be
honest
and
forthcoming
in
their
dealing
with

of
this
community
student
handbook
to
give
you
a
brief
synopsis
earlier
this
academic
year
the
three
of
us
approach
this
student
as
we
have
do
with
former
student
to
work
on
our
website
project
he
agree
to
work
on
our
site
and
this
begin
our
three
month
work
relationship
with
him
over
those
three
month
in
breach
of
our
agreement
and
to
our
material
detriment
in
reliance
upon
his
misrepresentation
this
student
stall
the
development
of
our
website
while
he
begin
develop
his
own
website
thefacebook
com
in
unfair
competition
with
ours
and
without
our
knowledge
or
agreement
we
be
be
lead
to
believe
this
issue
fall
outside
of
the
realm
of
academic
and
the
like
however
we
believe
this
student
s
action
be
in
direct
violation
of
the
resolution
on
right
and
responsibility
adopt
by
the
faculty
of
art
and
science
on
april
which
state
the
follow
by
accept
membership
in
the
university
an
individual
join
a
community
ideally
characterize
by
free
expression
free
inquiry
intellectual
honest
respect
for
the
dignity
of
others
and
openness
to
constructive
change
as
the
leader
of
our
university
we
think
you
should
be
aware
of
incident
that
abuse
the
honor
code
and
threaten
the
standard
of
the
community
we
believe
the
ramification
of
harvard
not
address
this
issue
will
have
long
term
negative
effect
throughout
the
school
community
and
beyond
therefore
we
be
request
a
meeting
to
speak
with
you
about

matter
at
your
early
convenience

inside
him
push
away
the
shock
he
point
toward
the
bookshelf
behind
the

he

summer
shook
his
head
his
jowl
reverberate
with
the
motion
like

storm
you
enter
into
a
code

by
the
system
by
the
university
itself
he
have
always
see
himself
as
a
member
of
the
harvard
community
as
part
of
an
honorable
order
world
now
the

beneath
the
material
of
his

be
obvious
from
his

do
about

strange
trip

be
it
isn
t
difficult
to
imagine
the
detail
of
that
morning
sometime
in
march
of
even
though
the
moment
itself
become
historical
only
in
retrospect
sean
parker
s
eye
flash
open
as
he
come
awake
to
that
sudden
and
musical
thought
bounce
around
in
his
brain
a
frenetic
little
ear
worm
let
loose
through
the
thin
membrane
of
his
aural
canal
infect
his
gray
matter
power
up
the
synapsis
flick
all
the
red
light
to
green
he
grin
as
he
usually
do
in
the
morning
star
up
at
a
blank
white
ceiling
try
to
remember
where
he
be
what
a
long
strange
trip
it
s
be
he
rubbed
the
last
gasp
of
sleep
out
of
his
eye
then
stretch
his
arm
up
above
his
head
feel
the
cool
plush
material
of
the
heavy
down
pillow
and
it
all
come
back
to
him
he
be
lie
on
a
bed
push
right
up
against
a
blandly
color
wall
of
a
little
bedroom
his
head
sunk
deep
into
that
pillow
his
hair
be
a
mess
a
tangle
of
brown
blond
curl
mushroom
out
against
the
soft
material
of
the
pillowcase
he
be
wear
a
t
shirt
and
sweatpants
but
that
be
only
because
it
be
six
in
the
morning
his
armani
jacket
skinny
legged
pitch
black
dkny
jean
and
tailor
prada
shirt
be
hang
from
a
hook
on
the
back
of
the
door
to
the
bathroom
what
a
long
strange
trip
it
s
be
his
grin
turn
cheshire
stretch
out
the
edge
of
his
lip
so
far
it
almost
hurt
yes
he
knew
exactly
where
he
be
and
it
be
a
fuck
awesome
place
to
be
he
look
around
his
little
bedroom
take
in
the
little
wooden
dresser
the
bookshelf
full
of
computer
textbook
the
lamp
in
the
corner
the
sleep
laptop
on
the
miniature
side
table
by
the
bed
there
be
clothes
strewn
all
over
the
place
on
the
floor
the
bookshelf
even
hang
from
the
lamp
but
sean
didn
t
mind
because
most
of
them
be
his
clothes
and
the
one
that
weren
t
be
pretty
damn
sexy
he
saw
a
frilly
bra
and
too
short
skirt
a
tank
top
and
tight
stylish
belt
the
kind
of
clothes
that
college
girl
wore
on
campus
all
over
california
even
here
up
north
where
the
palm
tree
be
more
often
draped
in
fog
than
in
sunlight
thankfully
at
stanford
girl
still
dress
california
despite
the
school
s
elite
status
and
of
course
they
be
all
blond
let
the
angry
brunette
have
the
ivy
blond
and
pretty
rule
the
west
sean
push
himself
up
on
one
elbow
he
wasn
t
sure
whose
bra
skirt
tank
top
and
belt
be
in
his
room
he
assume
it
be
either
a
guest
of
one
of
his
roommate
or
someone
who
have
be
there
visit
him
he
wasn
t
certain
why
the
clothes
be
in
his
room
either
he
might
have
know
the
girl
he
might
not
have
either
way
she
probably
knew
him
or
at
least
she
thought
she
do
it
seem
like
everybody
at
stanford
knew
sean
parker
which
be
kind
of
funny
consider
that
he
wasn
t
a
student
there
this
house
that
he
be
living
in
be
full
of
stanford
kid
it
be
really
just
an
extension
of
the
dorm
right
next
to
campus
but
sean
wasn
t
a
stanford
student
he
hadn
t
even
go
to
college
but
he
be
still
a
campus
hero
not
quite
as
famous
as
his
original
business
partner
shawn
fan
but
those
who
knew
the
story
knew
the
story
the
two
teenager
who
d
change
the
record
industry
by
create
a
file
share
web
site
call
napster
a
site
that
let
college
kid
everywhere
get
whatever
music
they
want
for
free
in
the
privacy
of
their
dorm
room
by
share
with
one
another
over
the
internet
napster
be
a
massive
success
a
world
change
creation
well
okay
it
have
also
kind
of
implode
but
it
have
be
a
beautiful
implosion
napster
which
sean
have
cofounded
after
meeting
fan
in
an
internet
chat
room
while
they
be
both
still
in
high
school
be
less
a
company
than
a
revolution
napster
have
make
music
free
have
make
it
downloadable
have
give
every
kid
with
a
computer
real
power
to
get
what
they
want
freedom
wasn
t
that
what
rock
and
roll
have
be
all
about
wasn
t
that
what
the
internet
be
suppose
to
be
about
of
course
the
record
company
hadn
t
see
it
that
way
the
fuck
record
company
have
descend
on
the
two
seans
like
vengeful
harpy
they
d
battle
back
but
the
end
be
really
a
foregone
conclusion
some
people
thought
it
be
sean
parker
s
fault
when
it
all
finally
tumble
and
fell
accord
to
some
print
report
he
d
write
some
e
mail
that
have
end
up
help
out
the
record
company
in
their
legal
battle
a
foolish
youthful
indiscretion
that
have
cost
napster
the
endgame
but
see
that
have
always
be
sean
s
problem
and
also
his
strength
he
be
out
there
he
didn
t
keep
anything
inside
and
he
didn
t
regret
anything
no
fuck
way
that
wasn
t
his
style
sure
he
could
have
curl
up
into
a
ball
after
napster
have
collapse
or
run
home
to
his
parent
but
instead
he
d
gotten
right
back
on
that
silicon
horse
just
a
couple
short
year
later
he
and
two
of
his
closest
friend
have
come
up
with
an
idea
that
built
on
the
notion
of
share
but
this
time
they
d
focus
on
e
mail
and
contact
information
it
start
as
a
free
system
just
a
little
program
that
would
send
out
request
for
update
info
and
it
turn
into
a
sort
of
constant
self
renovate
online
business
card
system
they
d
call
the
company
plaxo
and
then
well
in
sean
s
view
that
have
kind
of
implode
as
well
not
the
company
plaxo
be
still
do
great
the
business
be
probably
now
worth
million
but
sean
s
participation
in
it
be
over
finish
kaput
in
his
view
he
d
be
kick
out
of
his
own
company
and
it
have
be
even
uglier
than
it
sound
ugly
because
in
sean
s
mind
there
have
be
a
real
villain
involve
a
james
bond
kind
of
villain
a
bizarre
secretive
welshman
with
a
megalomaniacal
streak
almost
as
big
as
his
bank
account
it
have
be
sean
s
idea
to
bring
in
the
vc
monster
in
the
begin
because
he
d
thought
that
plaxo
need
the
money
and
he
d
thought
that
he
knew
how
to
deal
with
vcs
but
michael
moritz
wasn
t
just
any
vc
he
be
one
of
the
partner
at
sequoia
capital
and
a
deity
among
the
silicon
valley
moneyman
he
d
invest
in
both
yahoo
and
google
make
such
a
fortune
that
nobody
would
ever
question
his
method
again
in
sean
s
view
moritz
be
reclusive
mysterious
and
also
maniacal
from
the
start
he
and
sean
be
butting
head
on
almost
every
issue
sean
be
a
freethinker
a
young
and
wild
entrepreneur
moritz
seem
to
be
about
money
pure
and
simple
barely
a
year
after
seqouia
fund
the
company
sean
believe
that
moritz
decide
that
sean
have
to
go
leave
the
company
he
d
found
and
of
course
he
d
refuse
it
become
a
pitch
battle
a
vc
coup
and
eventually
sean
have
begin
to
realize
that
he
be
go
to
end
up
on
the
lose
end
of
the
situation
his
two
closest
friend
whom
he
d
start
the
company
with
in
sean
s
eye
they
d
succumbed
to
the
pressure
of
moritz
and
the
board
and
accord
to
report
account
when
sean
try
fight
back
by
say
that
the
only
way
he
d
leave
be
if
he
could
sell
a
chunk
of
his
ownership
in
the
company
for
money
up
front
it
push
sequoia
into
war
mode
sean
believe
that
moritz
have
do
the
kind
of
thing
that
one
would
expect
a
james
bond
villain
to
do
sean
be
certain
he
d
hire
a
private
eye
to
follow
sean
around
to
try
to
get
the
ammunition
necessary
to
force
him
to
leave
sean
have
start
to
notice
car
with
dark
window
follow
him
when
he
left
his
apartment
he
d
notice
strange
click
when
he
be
on
the
phone
and
even
bizarre
callback
on
his
cell
phone
from
unlisted
number
it
have
start
to
get
terrify
and
maybe
they
really
have
be
get
dirt
like
any
kid
his
age
with
the
fame
he
d
acquire
through
napster
and
plaxo
sean
like
to
party
he
like
girl
he
certainly
wasn
t
a
saint
he
be
in
his
early
twenty
a
kind
of
silicon
valley
rock
star
and
he
talk
really
fast
thought
really
fast
there
be
a
certain
jerky
frenetic
quality
to
him
a
quality
that
could
be
easily
misinterpret
so
maybe
they
have
something
on
him
maybe
they
didn
t
in
any
event
in
sean
s
view
moritz
lock
him
out
make
him
resign
from
his
own
company
make
him
hand
over
the
key
to
his
own
fuck
creation
at
the
same
time
sean
believe
he
have
lose
both
a
company
and
his
two
former
best
friend
it
have
be
ugly
and
it
have
be
pathetic
and
in
sean
s
view
it
have
be
unfair
but
well
it
have
happen
not
just
to
him
in
silicon
valley
it
happen
all
the
time
that
be
the
thing
about
vc
money
it
be
awesome
until
it
wasn
t
plaxo
have
end
badly
but
that
hadn
t
meant
it
be
over
for
sean
parker
not
even
close
the
silicon
valley
gossip
rag
have
gotten
even
more
excite
about
him
after
the
twofer
of
napster
and
plaxo
and
they
begin
to
paint
him
as
this
bad
boy
around
town
the
girl
the
designer
clothes
and
of
course
unsubstantiated
story
about
drug
coke
pill
god
knew
what
else
sean
be
half
expect
to
open
up
gawker
one
day
and
read
about
himself
mainline
baby
seal
blood
the
idea
that
he
be
a
bad
boy
be
kind
of
funny
to
him
he
guess
it
be
utterly
hilarious
to
anyone
who
d
know
him
grow
up
in
chantilly
virginia
he
be
a
skinny
kid
allergic
to
peanut
bee
and
shellfish
and
carry
an
epipen
fill
with
adrenaline
with
him
wherever
he
go
he
have
asthma
and
also
carry
an
inhaler
he
have
hair
that
be
so
unruly
it
sometimes
veer
toward
an
afro
and
okay
skinny
be
kind
of
an
understatement
he
wasn
t
exactly
intimidate
physically
the
twin
bed
be
big
enough
for
him
to
do
a
gymnastics
floor
routine
bad
boy
of
silicon
valley
the
idea
be
almost
ludicrous
he
look
at
the
frilly
bra
on
the
floor
of
his
room
and
smile
again
okay
maybe
he
do
have
his
moment
a
slight
hedonistic
streak
as
the
private
eye
probably
discover
he
like
girl
sometimes
lot
of
girl
he
like
to
go
out
late
and

next
big
thing
be
he
knew
with
a
complete
and
almost
religious
certainty
social
network
just
a
few
month
ago
he
d
make
some
connection
at
the
social
network
site
friendster
he
d
brought
them
some
series
d
vc
funding
introduce
them
to
his
buddy
around
town
most
notably
peter
thiel
the
guy
behind
paypal
a
colleague
who
d
also
experienced
some
run
in
with
the
gang
at
sequoia
but
friendster
wasn
t
go
to
be
sean
parker
s
next
home
run
it
be
already
too
far
along
and
sean
wasn
t
get
in
anywhere
near
the
ground
floor
and
to
be
honest
friendster
have
its
limitation
it
be
really
a
date
web
site
a
good
one
more
disguise
than
match
or
jdate
but
it
be
about
meeting
chick
you
didn
t
know
and
try
to
get
their
e
mail
then
there
be
myspace
the
ascendant
fledgling
site
that
be
grow
real
fast
which
sean
have
also
look
into
and
decide
against
myspace
be
great
for
what
it
be
but
to
sean
it
wasn
t
really
a
social
network
you
didn
t
go
on
myspace
to
communicate
you
go
there
to
show
yourself
off
it
be
like
one
big
narcissistic
playground
look
at
me
look
at
me
look
at
my
garage
band
comedy
routine
act
reel
model
portfolio
and
on
and
on
and
on
it
be
throw
your
brand
out
there
and
hop
someone
paid
attention
to
you
so
if
friendster
be
a
date
sight
and
myspace
a
branding
tool
what
do
that
leave
sean
wasn
t
sure
but
somewhere
out
there
he
knew
there
be
a
fan
plug
away
in
some
basement
work
on
the
napster
of
social
networking
sean
just
have
to
keep
his
eye
open
he
knew
he
have
set
the
bar
really
fuck
high
if
it
wasn
t
a
billion
dollar
company
his
own
youtube
his
google
then
it
wasn
t
worth
his
time
but
he
d
already
have
a
plaxo
and
the
experience
have
be
less
than
satisfy
the
next
time
it
would
be
a
billion
dollar
or
bust
sean
push
himself
to
a
sit
position
the
energy
rise
inside
of
him
it
be
time
to
get
back
to
his
quest
he
glance
at
the
small
table
next
to
the
futon
notice
the
open
laptop
rest
next
to
a
pink
girl
s
watch

wasn
t
his

be
either
one
of
his
roommate
or
one
of
his
or
their
houseguest
either
way
it
be
close
enough
that
he
could
reach
it
from
bed
which
make
it
the
default
first
choice
it
be
time
to
check

begin
his
morning
routine

reach
for

gently
on
his
lap
a
few
second
later
the
computer
come
out
of

saw
immediately
that
it
be
already
hooked
up
to
the
internet
through
the
stanford

he
also
notice
that
there
be
a
web

across
the

soft
blue
band
across
the
top

too
maybe
kelly

right
and
nobody
be
go
to
ask
for
their
id
but
that
be
beside
the
point
neither
she
nor
mark
be
take
this
seriously
and
it
be
drive
eduardo
crazy
and
it
wasn
t
just
the
restaurant
the
whole
trip
to
new
york
mark
have
be
goof
around
pretend
this
be
all
just
some
big
joke
maybe
kelly
could
get
away
with
it
she
be
at
the
dinner
only
because
she
happen
to
be
visit
her
family
in
queen
but
mark
be
suppose
to
be
in
new
york
on
business
though
they
be
stay
with
friend
instead
of
a
hotel
eduardo
have
picked
up
the
travel
and
all
the
food
and
taxi
bill
more
accurately
they
be
pay
for
it
out
of
thefacebook
s
bankroll
the
quickly
dwindle
thousand
dollar
that
eduardo
have
put
in
back
in
january
three
and
a
half
month
ago
that
define
the
trip
as
a
business
expense
so
mark
should
have
be
treat
the
excursion
as
serious
business
but
he
d
do
nothing
of
the
sort
for
his
part
eduardo
have
manage
to
set
up
a
handful
of
meeting
with
potential
advertiser
none
of
the
meeting
have
go
particularly
well
however
and
it
hadn
t
help
that
mark
have
slept
through
about
half
of
them
and
have
spent
the
other
half
sit
silently
while
eduardo
try
to
pick
up
all
the
slack
though
everyone
they
d
met
have
seem
impressed
by
the
number
of
people
they
d
gotten
to
sign
up
to
thefacebook
over
seventy
five
thousand
at
last
count
nobody
be
willing
to
put
any
significant
money
into
place
ad
on
the
network
they
just
didn
t
get
it
yet
and
advertising
on
the
internet
in
general
be
such
a
dicey
thing
it
be
simply
hard
to
get
the
advertiser
to
understand
how
different
thefacebook
be
the
fact
that
people
who
go
on
thefacebook
tend
to
stay
online
longer
than
on
almost
any
other
site
be
lose
on
them
the
even
more
impressive
statistic
that
most
kid
who
try
out
thefacebook
once
tend
to
come
back
percent
every
day
be
completely
beyond
their
comprehension
but
maybe
if
mark
have
take
it
all
a
little
more
seriously
thing
would
have
go
a
bit
well
case
in
point
here
they
be
at
one
of
the
fanciest
new
restaurant
in
new
york
and
he
be
sit
there
in
that
damn
fleece
hoody
his
flip
flop
bounce
off
each
other
under
the
table
grant
they
weren
t
at
to
meet
with
a
potential
advertiser
but
it
be
still
business
and
mark
should
have
look
the
part
at
the
very
least
he
should
have
try
to
look
hip
because
in
this
place
he
stuck
out
like
a
sore
thumb
locate
on
the
first
floor
of
the
textile
building
in
tribeca

spot
and
quite
possibly
the
nice
chinese
restaurant
eduardo
have
ever
see
sleek
and
minimalist
the
place
be
extremely
modern
from
the
twelve
foot
tall
curve
glass
wall
that
take
up
much
of
the
entrance
to
the
huge
fish
tank
that
separate
the
din
area
from
the
kitchen
the
floor

bamboo
and
frost

separate
the
various
leather

there
be
also
a
huge
forty
person
communal
table
next
to
another

wall
behind
which
the
bartender
scamper
about
their

back
and

chinese
red
silk
banner
hung
from
the
ceiling
but
otherwise
it
seem
more
fusion
than
asian
at
least
to
eduardo
s
palate
since
their
guest
be
run
late
they
d
already
order
some
thing
from
the
menu
lacquer
pork
with
a
shallot
and
ginger
confit
tuna
tartar
a
lobster

with
ginger
and
wine
and
foie

jammed
into
oversize
shrimp
dumpling
eduardo
s
girlfriend
hadn
t
be
too
thrill
with
the
item
and
he
could
tell
she
be
just
biding
her
time
until
they
could
order
dessert
homemade
ice
cream
that
come
in
little
tiny
chinese
takeout
container
though
if
she
could
convince
one
of
the
waiter
to
give
them
drink
without
check
their
age
she
d
forget
all
about
the
ice
cream
she
probably
wasn
t
a
keeper
but
kelly
be
still
tall
and
pretty
and
eduardo
have
manage
to
keep
her
interested
since
their
episode
in
the
dorm
bathroom
mark
have
long
lose
her
friend
alice
but
no
matter
mark
didn
t
seem
to
care
one
way
or
the
other
at
the
moment
though
kelly
wasn
t
the
big
issue
dominate
eduardo
s
thought
he
be
much
more
concerned
about
the
reason
they
be
at
the
restaurant
in
the
first
place
and
the
guy
they
be
there
to
meet
eduardo
didn
t
know
much
about
sean
parker
but
what
he
d
found
out
by
a
simple
search
on
the
internet
he
didn
t
like
parker
be
a
silicon
valley
animal
a
serial
entrepreneur
who
d
crashed
out
of
two
of
the
big
internet
company
in
what
sound
like
pretty
spectacular
fashion
to
eduardo
he
seem
like
some
sort
of
wild
man
maybe
even
a
little
dangerous
eduardo
have
no
idea
why
the
guy
want
to
talk
to
them
or
what
parker
want
from
them
but
he
be
pretty
sure
he
didn
t
want
anything
from
parker
speak
of
the
devil
eduardo
caught
site
of

first
as
he
step
out
from
behind
the
curve
glass
entrance
although
it

because
he
be
make
quite
an
entrance
bounce
off
the
wall
like
some
sort
of
animate
cartoon
creature
a
tasmanian
devil
spin
through
the
restaurant
he
seem
to

first
he
be

example
he

the
baylor
story
how
the
little
texan
university

at
first
refuse
to
adopt

because
the

a
social
network

its
own
so
instead
of
attack
baylor
head
on
they
d
make
a
list
of
all
the
school
within
a
hundred
mile
radius
of

pretty
soon
all
the
kid
at
baylor
be
see
all
their

within
day
the
baylor
social
web
site
be
history
sean
seem
really
excite
by
the
story
he
then
add
to
it
by
quote
something
he
d
read
in
the
stanford
newspaper
the
stanford
daily
on
march
class
be
be
skip

an
instant

there
be
no
deny
it
as
for
eduardo
well
sean
wasn
t
purposely
ignore
eduardo
but
he
be
definitely
pay
a
lot
more
attention
to
mark
maybe
it
be
just
the
fact
that
they
be
both
computer
savvy
but
then
again
sean
didn
t
strike
mark
as
a
computer
geek
he
be
a
geek
sure
but
his
geekiness
seem
more
chic
like
he
be
just
play
a
geek
on
some
prime
time
television
show
it
wasn
t
just
the
way
he
be
dress
or
his
amped
up
demeanor
it
be
the
way
he
handle

pretty
fast
after
that
although

forever
to
eduardo
who
almost
applaud
when
kelly

sean
picked
up
the
check
excuse
himself
and
promise

soon
then
the

as
quickly
as
he
d
appear
ten
minute
later
eduardo
be
stand
next
to
mark
on
the
sidewalk
outside
the
restaurant
his
hand
in
the
air
as
he
try
to
hail
a
cab
eduardo
s
girl
have
go
off
to
meet
sean
and
his
girlfriend
to
some
bar
nearby
in

where
they
be

go
to
meet
up
with
them
later
but
he

a
few
phone
call
to
make
more
advertiser
meeting
they
be
try
to
set
up
he
wasn
t
go
to
give
up
no
matter
how
difficult
thing
get
hand
still
in
the
air
eduardo
glance
over
at
mark
he
could
see
that
his
friend
still
have
that
flush
look
on
his
face
parker
be
go
but
his
aura
still
linger
in
the
air
he
s
like
a
snake
oil
salesman
eduardo
say
try
to
break
the
spell
i
mean
he
s
a
serial
entrepreneur
we
don
t
really
need
him
mark
shrug
but
didn
t
respond
eduardo
frown
he
could
tell
that
his
word
be
fall
on
deaf
ear
mark
like
parker
idolize
him
there
be
no
way
around
it
eduardo
guess
it
didn
t
really
matter
not
at
the
moment
it
wasn
t
like
parker
be
go
to
throw
money
at
them
the
guy
didn
t
have
any
real
money
yet
as
far
as
eduardo
could
tell
and
thefacebook
need
money
as
it
grow
and
grow
they
be
force
to
upgrade
their
server
and
they
have
also
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
need
to
hire
a
couple
more
people
to
work
on
the
program
intern
they
d
call
them
but
they
d
have
to
pay
them
something
which
be
why
tomorrow
they
be
go
to
open
a
new
bank
account
and
put
some
more
money
into
the
project
eduardo
have
freed
up
ten
thousand
dollar
to
invest
into
the
account
mark
didn
t
have
any
fund
of
his
own
so
they
d
be
rely
on
eduardo
s
money
for
a
while
longer
although
parker
didn
t
have
huge
funding
ability
himself
he
probably
do
have
some
major
connection
to
vc
capital
but
thankfully
for
once
mark
s
disinterest
in
money
make
that
beside
the
point
for
him
the
web
site
be
still
primarily
about
fun
and
it
have
to
stay
cool
advertising

t
cool
either
guy
in

eduardo
didn
t
have
to
worry
that
mark
would
be
look
for
vc
funding
anytime
soon
still
eduardo
couldn
t

even
despite
his
vc
friend
sean
parker
be
the
definition
of

the
thought
into
the
back
of
his
mind
everything

so
well

damn
thing
without
the
help
of
sean
parker
eduardo
have
a
feel
sean
parker
couldn
t
possibly

be
the
only
one
who
d
take
notice
of
their
little
web
site
it
be

matter
of
time
before
deep
pocket
come
call
pocket
that
could
afford
a
bit
more
than

on
the
professor

back
and
forth
on
the

at
the

of
the
midsize

but
it
be
almost
impossible
for
one
thing
he
wasn
t
even
sure
what
class
this
be
but
it
have
something
to

fight
that
urge
not
to
turn
around
and
stare

be
exactly
what
he
do
because
he
really
couldn
t
help
himself
it
take
less
than
a
second
to
spot
the
guy

real
offer
and
neither
mark
nor
eduardo
be
inclined
to
take
any
of
them
seriously
even
if
they
have
be
interested
in
sell
out
which
they
hadn
t
even
discuss
at
the
same
time
facebook
have
now
cross
member
and
be
add
thousand
more
every
day
if
thing
continued
like
that
eduardo
be
sure
the
site
be
go
to
be
worth
serious
money
now
that
the
school
year
be
almost
over
he
and
mark
have
to
make
some
important
decision
go
forward
even
with
dustin
and
chris
pull
their
weight
thefacebook
be
begin
to
feel
like
a
full
time
job
with
school
end
it
would
be
easy
to
balance
everything
but
thefacebook
be
certainly
go
to
be
a
priority
for
both
of
them
over
the
summer
eduardo
have
make
a
little
progress
with
advertiser
over
the
past
month
he
d
be
aggressively
solicit
on
both
national
and
local
level
and
have
already
run
free
test
ad
for
a
handful
of
big
company
such
as
at
t
wireless
america

and
monster

he
d
also

some
advertisement
to
a
few

thirty
dollar
a
day
to
drum
up
interest
in
an
upcoming
trip
to
new
hampshire
so
the
site
be
earn
a
little
bit
of
cash
not
quite
enough
to
offset
the
rapidly
grow
server
cost
and
the
upgrade
and
maintenance
necessary
now
that
there
be
so
many
people
on
the
site
twenty
four
hour
a
day
but
it
be
a
start
eduardo
have
also
move
the
business
along
in
term
of
its
structure
he
and
mark
have
officially
incorporate
themselves
on
april
legally
create
thefacebook
llc
register
in
florida
where
eduardo
s
family
live
in
the
incorporation
document
they
d
laid
out
the
ownership
of
the
company
as
they
d
agree
upon
in
mark
s
dorm
room
percent
ownership
for
mark
percent
for
eduardo
and
percent
for
dustin
chris
be
still
go
to
get
some
percentage
in
the
future
but
that
hadn
t
be
decide
on
yet
in
any
event
just
have
those
incorporation
document
make
the
company
feel
more
real
even
if
it
wasn
t
actually
make
any
profit
yet
but
even
with
the
incorporation
document
and
the
continued
viral
growth
of
thefacebook
the
decision
of
what
to
do
when
school
end
in
a
few
week
be
still
a
difficult
one
both
mark
and
eduardo
have
go
through
the
motion
of
look
for
summer
job
mark
hadn
t
found
anything
he
d
be
psyched
about
but
eduardo
through
his
phoenix
connection
and
his
family
s
friend
have
manage
to
land
a
pretty
prestigious
internship
at
a
new
york
investment
bank
eduardo
have
go
back
and
forth
about
the
internship
with
his
dad
and
it
have
be
pretty
obvious
which
way
his
dad
have
be
lean
thefacebook
be
grow
and
incredibly
popular
but
it
still
wasn
t
make
any
real
money
the
internship
be
a
respectable
job
and
an
amaze
opportunity
and
since
most
of
the
advertiser
the
facebook
be
chase
after
be
base
in
new
york
anyway
didn
t
it
make
sense
for
him
to
take
the
internship
and
work
on
thefacebook
during
his
spare
time
before
eduardo
have
even
be
able
to
bring
up
the
idea
with
mark
mark
have
drop
a
bombshell
of
his
own
although
thefacebook
be
his
priority
as
well
he
d
start
develop
a
side
project
call
wirehog
with
a
couple
of
his
computer
program
buddy
adam
d
angelo
his
high
school
friend
with
whom
he
d
invent
synapse
and
andrew
mccollum
a
classmate
and
fellow
c
major
wirehog
be
basically
a
bastard
child
of
napster
and
facebook
a
sort
of
file
share
program
with
a
social
network
feel
wirehog
would
be
downloadable
software
that
would
allow
people
to
share
anything
from
music
to
picture
to
video
with
friend
via
personalize
profile
page
link
to
other
friend
in
a
personally
control
network
the
idea
be
when
mark
be
finish
with
wirehog
he
d
merge
it
into
thefacebook
as
an
application
meanwhile
both
he
and
dustin
would
also
be
continue
to
upgrade
thefacebook
they
hop
to
increase
the
number
of
school
use
the
web
site
from
about
thirty
now
to
over
one
hundred
by
the
end
of
the
summer
it
be
a
heady
task
especially
combine
with
the
wirehog
project
but
mark
seem
more
thrill
than
overwhelmed
and
the
fact
that
mark
plan
to
divide
his
time
between
the
two
project
make
eduardo
s
decision
to
take
the
internship
a
little
easy
it
wasn
t
until
mark
have
drop
the
second
bombshell
that
eduardo
start
to
feel
a
little
concerned
mark
have
broken
the
news
to
eduardo
just
yesterday
in
fact
after
eduardo
have
already
accepted
the
internship
and
have
even
start
look
for
rental
apartment
in
new
york
somewhere
in
the
past
few
week
mark
have
explain
in
his
dorm
room
over
a
six
pack
of
beck
s
he
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
for
the
next
few
month
california
seem
like
the
place
he
should
be
he
want
to
work
on
wirehog
and
thefacebook
in
silicon
valley
a
place
of
legend
to
computer
programmer
like
mark
the
land
of
all
of
his
hero
coincidentally
andrew
mccollum
have
land
a
job
at
silicon
valley
base
ea
sport
and
adam
d
angelo
be
go
as
well
mark
and
his
computer
friend
have
even
found
a
cheap
sublet
on
a
street
call
la
jennifer
way
in
palo
alto
right
near
the
stanford
campus
to
mark
it
seem
like
a
perfect
plan
he
d
bring
dustin
along
they
d
set
up
shop
in
the
rental
house
and
thefacebook
and
wirehog
would
be
right
where
they
belong
california
silicon
valley
the
epicenter
of
the
online
world
even
a
day
later
eduardo
still
hadn
t
come
to
term
with
mark
s
second
bombshell
in
truth
he
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
it
all
not
only
be
california
as
far
away
from
new
york
as
you
could
get
but
it
be
also
to
him
a
dangerous
and
seductive
place
while
eduardo
be
off
in
new
york
chase
advertiser
guy
in
suit
like
the
vc
sit
a
few
row
behind
them
would
be
chase
mark
and
even
bad
than
the
guy
in
suit
be
the
guy
like
sean
parker
who
knew
the
exact
button
to
push
run
the
business
out
of
california
have
never
be
the
plan
mark
and
dustin
be
suppose
to
be
programmer
while
eduardo
be
suppose
to
play
the
businessman
if
they
separate
how
be
eduardo
go
to
guide
the
business
like
they
d
agree
but
mark
have
shrug
off
eduardo
s
concern
when
he
d
voiced
them
there
be
no
reason
why
they
couldn
t
work
from
two
city
at
once
mark
and
dustin
would
continue
program
while
eduardo
would
find
advertiser
and
handle
the
finance
in
any
event
there
wasn
t
time
to
debate
the
issue
mark
have
already
make
his
decision
and
eduardo
have
accepted
his
internship
in
new
york
they
d
just
have
to
find
a
way
to
make
it
work
eduardo
didn
t
love
the
idea
but
he
figure
it
be
only
for
a
few
month
then
they
d
both
be
back
at
school
be
chase
around
by
vcs
in
ridiculous
gray
suit
i
guess
i
should
go
talk
to
him
eduardo
whisper
as
he
turn
away
from
the
man
s
hundred
watt
smile
you
want
to
come
too
they
re
always
good
for
a
free
lunch
mark
shook
his
head
we
re
interview
intern
today
eduardo
nod
remember
mark
and
dustin
have
decide
that
they
d
need
to
bring
at
least
two
intern
with
them
to
california
if
they
be
go
to
have
any
chance
at
reach
a
hundred
school
by
the
end
of
the
summer
which
would
cost
them
of
course
nobody
be
go
to
follow
them
across
the
country
for
free
the
word
they
d
put
out
through
the
c
department
be
that
they
be
go
to
pay
somewhere
in
the
order
of
eight
thousand
dollar
for
the
summer
job
along
with
room
and
board
in
the
la
jennifer
way
sublet
it
seem
like
a
lot
consider
that
the
company
wasn
t
make
any
money
yet
but
eduardo
have
agree
to
fund
the
project
once
again
out
of
his
investment
earnings
in
a
few
day
he
plan
to
open
a
new
bank
of
america
account
in
the
company
s
name
he
d
freed
up
eighteen
thousand
dollar
to
deposit
into
the
account
and
he
be
go
to
give
mark
a
package
of
blank
check
to
fund
their
operation
in
california
as
the
man
in
charge
of
the
business
side
of
the
operation
it
seem
the
right
thing
to
do
after
i
m
do
with
this
bozo
eduardo
respond
i
ll
come
by
and
help
out
with
the
intern
should
be
interest
mark
respond
and
eduardo
be
pretty
sure
he
saw
the
hint
of
an
evil
little
grin
interest
could
mean
just
about
anything
in
mark
s
unusual
world
and
go
we
can
imagine
the
scene
that
eduardo
witness
when
he
step
through
the
threshold
of
the
basement
classroom
just
as
the
place
explode
his
ear
rang
from
the
shout
raucous
laughter
and
applause
and
he
have
to
push
his
way
through
a
crowd
of
onlooker
just
to
see
what
the
hell
be
go
on
the
crowd
be
mostly
men
mostly
freshman
and
sophomore
and
all
computer
program
student
obvious
from
the
pasty
pallor
of
their
cheek
to
the
way
they
seem
completely
comfortable
in
the
low
ceilinged
ultramodern
comp
lab
they
completely
ignore
eduardo
as
he
jostled
his
way
to
the
front
of
the
mob
and
when
he
finally
make
it
through
he
could
see
why
the
game
be
in
full
swing
and
it
be
infinitely
more
interest
than
even
he
could
have
imagine
the
center
of
the
computer
lab
have
be
clear
out
in
the
clearing
five
table
have
be
line
up
next
to
one
another
and
on
each
table
sat
a
laptop
computer
next
to
a
row
of
shot
glass
fill
with
jack
daniel
s
whiskey
five
computer
geek
be
at
the
table
furiously
pound
the
keyboard
of
the
laptop
at
the
head
of
the
table
stood
mark
with
a
timer
in
his
hand
eduardo
could
see
the
screen
from
his
vantage
point
but
to
him
they
be
just
a
jumble
of
number
and
letter
no
doubt
the
kid
at
the
table
be
race
through
some
byzantine
complex
computer
code
probably
design
by
mark
and
dustin
to
test
just
how
good
they
really
be
when
one
of
the
kid
reach
a
point
in
the
code
that
make
the
screen
blink
he
look
up
then
down
one
of
the
shot
of
whiskey
the
crowd
erupt
into
applause
again
and
the
kid
go
right
back
to
his
program
eduardo
be
immediately
remind
of
the
boat
race
he
have
take
part
in
during
his
initiation
into
the
phoenix
and
this
too
be
an
initiation
of
sort
into
mark
s
world
the
final
club
he
have
create
with
his
imagination
and
his
computer
prowess
it
be
a
race
a
test
and
probably
the
odd
interview
session
for
an
internship
these
kid
would
ever
go
through
but
if
it
bother
them
at
all
none
of
them
be
show
it
the
expression
on
their
face
be
of
pure
enjoyment
they
be
hack
while
do
shot
prove
not
only
their
capability
at
program
under
pressure
but
also
their
willingness
to
follow
mark
anywhere
not
just
to
california
but
wherever
he
want
to
lead
them
to
them
mark
wasn
t
just
a

he
be
rapidly
become
a
god
after
ten
more
minute
of
shout
key
slam
and
shot
pound
two
of
the
kid
leap
to
their
foot
almost
simultaneously
turn
their
chair
over
behind
them
we
have
our
winner
congratulation
at
that
moment
someone
hit
an
mp
player
hooked
up
to
speaker
in
the
corner
of
the

eduardo
have
to
smile
the

close
in
around
him
fill
the

space
and
then
the
place
be
near
bedlam
as
everyone
move
to
congratulate
the
new
intern
eduardo
be
jostled
backward
and
he
let
himself
go
with
the
flow
content
to
just
watch
mark
have
his
moment
he
saw
mark
and
dustin
join
the
intern
form
a
little
cabal
in
the
center
of
the
room
he
also
notice
that
there
be
a
pretty
asian
girl
at
mark
s
side
tall
chinese
with
jet
black
hair
and
a
really
nice
smile
she
d
be
around
mark
a
fair
amount
in
the
past
few
week
her
name
be
priscilla
and
he
be
start
to
think
that
this
girl
be
go
to
be
mark
s
girlfriend
a
concept
that
have
seem
unthinkable
just
four
month
ago
thing
have
certainly
change
for
both
of
them
for
once
mark
look
genuinely
happy
in
the
center
of
the
swarm
of
idolize
computer
programmer
and
eduardo
be
happy
too
even
though
he
be
off
to
the
side
watch
he
decide
then
and
there
that
they
could
make
it
work
he
could
run
the
company
out
of
new
york
while
mark
and
dustin
mccollum
and
the
intern
do
the
program
in
california
maybe
they
d
make
some
good
connection
in
silicon
valley
while
they
be
there
connection
that
eduardo
could
mine
for
the
well
advancement
of
the
site
they
be
a
team
and
he
would
be
a
team
player
even
if
that
meant
watch
over
them
from
three
thousand
mile
away
and
anyway
in
three
month
they
d
all
be
back
at
school
eduardo
enter
his
senior
year
mark
his
junior
and
life
would
continue
maybe
they
d
be
rich
by
then
or
maybe
they
d
be
right
where
they
be
now
watch
their
company
grow
and
grow
either
way
they
be
already
far
different
from
when
they
begin
this
adventure
and
eduardo
have
no
doubt
that
the
future
be
go
to
be
grand
he
push
any
concern
away
because
that
s
what
a
team
player
do
there
be
no
need
to
be
paranoid
truly
he
ask
himself
how
much
could
go
wrong
in
a
handful
of
month
three
two
one
tyler
felt
his
finger
whiten
against
the
crystal
flute
of
champagne
as
he
watch
divya
and
cameron
hunch
next
to
each
other
over
the
desktop
computer
divya
s
finger
be
in
the
air
pause
over
the
computer
s
keyboard
he
be
draw
this
out
for
all
it
be
worth
try
to
make
it
as
dramatic
as
possible
in
theory
the
moment
be
dramatic
the
launch
of
the
web
site
they
have
work
on
since
almost
two
full
year
rename
connectu
mostly
to
try
and
help
them
overcome
the
trauma
of
what
have
go
on
over
the
past
few
month
but
also
because
now
that
thefacebook
have
proven
that
the
idea
behind
the
harvard
connection
could
work
in
many
school
simultaneously
the
site
be
finally
ready
to
go
online
after
so
many
hour
of
discussion
planning
anxiety
so
many
day
spent
worry
over
the
design
of
the
site
the
graphic
the
feature
it
be
a
spectacular
moment
and
yet
it
didn
t
feel
that
spectacular
or
that
dramatic
maybe
that
be
because
in
practice
it
be
just
an
indian
kid
hit
a
key
on
a
computer
keyboard
while
two
identical
twin
watch
on
from
within
a
stark
almost
barren
quad
dorm
bedroom
most
of
tyler
s
belonging
have
already
be
packed
up
in
cardboard
box
which
be
label
and
stack
around
the
edge
of
the
small
room
his
and
cameron
s
dad
would
be
there
in
a
few
hour
to
help
them
move
out
and
then
they
would
be
leave
harvard
for
good
head
off
into
the
real
world
well
maybe
not
the
real
world
cameron
and
tyler
be
go
right
into
training
an
even
more
intense
regimen
than
they
have
be
follow
at
harvard
to
help
them
with
their
mission
their
father
have
revamped
a
boathouse
in
connecticut
they
d
hire
a
coach
and
now
that
they
have
graduate
they
be
go
to
make
a
serious
go
at
make
the
olympics
in
beijing
in
between
now
and
then
of
course
there
would
be
thousand
upon
thousand
of
hour
of
training
it
be
go
to
be
hard
painful
and
at
time
incredibly
aggravate
but
while
they
train
connectu
would
be
chug
along
hopefully
gain
member
in
college
across
the
country
hopefully
somehow
compete
with
thefacebook
myspace
friendster
and
all
the
other
social
network
that
be
already
move
forward
spread
like
virus
across
the
world
wide
web
tyler
knew
they
be
start
at
a
huge
disadvantage
he
knew
all
about
the
business
concept
of
first
mover
advantage
his
father
have
taught
business
at
wharton
for
twelve
year
after
found
his
consult
company
and
he
d
explain
the
idea
to
tyler
many
time
for
certain
industry
it
wasn
t
about
quality
of
product
or
even
corporate
strategy
it
be
about
who
get
there
first
it
be
a
landgrab
and
connectu
be
come
late
to
the
plain
which
be
exactly
what
be
so
damn
frustrate
about
what
mark
zuckerberg
have
do
to
them
in
tyler
s
mind
he
hadn
t
just
steal
their
idea
he
d
also
stall
them
for
two
month
if
he
d
just
told
them
he
wasn
t
go
to
program
their
site
they
d
have
found
someone
else
they
d
have
be
mad
but
they
d
have
move
forward
and
they
wouldn
t
have
blame
him
for
try
to
damage
their
dream
maybe
they
d
have
launch
first
and
it
would
be
connectu
that
every
college
kid
in
america
be
talk
about
it
would
be
connectu
that
be
change
the
social
life
of
so
many
people
it
be
beyond
frustrate
every
day
tyler
cameron
and
divya
have
to
listen
as
classmate
chat
on
and
on
about
thefacebook
and
not
just
at
harvard
the
damn
thing
be
everywhere
in
the
dorm
room
down
the
hall
on
the
laptop
in
every
bedroom
on
the
tv
news
almost
every
week
in
the
newspaper
sometimes
every
morning
mark
zuckerberg
mark
zuckerberg
mark
fuck
zuckerberg
okay
maybe
tyler
be
become
a
little
obsess
he
knew
from
mark
s
point
of
view
he
cameron
and
divya
be
just
a
blip
in
the
history
of
thefacebook
in
mark
s
mind
he
have
work
for
a
few
hour
for
some
jocky
classmate
gotten
bore
and
move
on
there
be
no
paper
sign
no
work
agreement
or
nondisclosures
or
noncompetes
mark
have
bullshit
them
in
e
mail
sure
but
in
his
mind
what
do
he
owe
a
couple
of
jock
who
couldn
t
even
write
computer
code
who
be
they
to
try
to
grasp
on
now
that
he
be
fly
so
high
sure
tyler
have
read
mark
s
letter
to
the
administration
his
e
mail
response
to
cameron
s
cease
and
desist
originally
mark
have
write
to
cameron
i
be
intrigue
by
the
project
and
be
ask
to
finish
the
connect
side
of
the
website
i
do
this
after
this
meeting
and
not
before
i
begin
work
on
thefacebook
use
none
of
the
same
code
nor
functionality
that
be
present
in
harvard
connection
the
only
common
aspect
of
the
site
be
that
user
can
upload
information
about
and
image
of
themselves
and
that
information
be
searchable
and
he
d
also
read
mark
s
more
vicious
response
to
the
university
when
tyler
and
cameron
have
be
try
to
get
the
ad
board
involve
i
try
not
to
get
involve
with
other
student
venture
since
they
be
generally
too
time
consume
and
don
t
provide
me
with
enough
room
to
be
creative
and
do
my
own
thing
i
do
however
make
an
effort
to
use
my
skill
to
help
out
those
who
be
try
to
develop
their
own
idea
for
website
perhaps
there
be
some
confusion
and
i
can
see
why
they
might
be
upset
that
i
release
a
successful
website
while
theirs
be
still
unfinished
but
i
definitely
didn
t
promise
them
anything
frankly
i
m
kind
of
appalled
that
they
re
threaten
me
after
the
work
i
ve
do
for
them
free
of
charge
but
after
deal
with
a
bunch
of
other
group
with
deep
pocket
and
good
legal
connection
include
company
like
microsoft
i
can
t
say
i
m
surprised
but
it
be
the
last
line
of
that
ad
board
letter
that
really
irk
tyler
after
trash
their
site
mark
have
conclude
i
try
to
shrug
it
off
as
a
minor
annoyance
that
whenever
i
do
something
successful
every
capitalist
out
there
want
a
piece
of
the
action
in
tyler
s
mind
that
be
utter
bullshit
for
tyler
cameron
and
divya
it
wasn
t
about
the
money
at
all
it
have
never
be
about
money
tyler
didn
t
give
a
shit
about
money
christ
his
family
have
plenty
of
money
it
be
about
honor
it
be
about
fairness
maybe
in
business
those
thing
could
be
push
to
the
side
maybe
in
a
hacker
s
world
those
thing
take
second
place
to
what
you
could
do
how
much
smarter
you
be
than
the
other
guy
but
to
tyler
there
be
nothing
more
important
than
honor
obviously
mark
felt
differently
about
the
subject
a
few
time
over
the
past
few
week
tyler
have
thought
about
just
go
over
to
the
kid
s
dorm
room
and
confront
him
face
to
face
but
he
d
resist
the
urge
because
he
d
know
that
it
wouldn
t
have
go
well
one
night
just
a
week
ago
cameron
have
in
fact
be
come
out
of
a
party
at
one
of
the
river
house
when
he
d
see
mark
stand
across
the
street
when
he
d
take
a
step
toward
the
kid
just
to
talk
mark
have
turn
and
sprint
away
there
be
no
doubt
in
tyler
s
mind
that
the
situation
would
never
be
resolve
by
a
simple
conversation
thing
have
already
gotten
too
ugly
for
that
the
only
choice
seem
to
be
to
move
forward
as
best
he
could
as
divya
finish
his
countdown
tyler
shook
his
angry
thought
away
focus
on
his
brother
and
friend
in
front
of
the
computer
this
moment
wasn
t
about
mark
zuckerberg
or
thefacebook
this
be
about
connectu
and
hopefully
they
be
turn
a
new
page
in
their
life
and
here
we
go
divya
continued
his
voice
rise
liftoff
his
finger
come
down
on
the
keyboard
the
screen
blink
and
then
it
be
do
connectu
have
go
live
it
be
out
there
and
hopefully
people
would
notice
hopefully
college
kid
would
sign
on
and
the
site
would
grow
and
grow
tyler
raise
his
glass
as
divya
and
cameron
clinked
theirs
together
then
he
take
a
long
drink
feel
the
bubble
against
his
throat
still
despite
the
celebratory
mood
he
couldn
t
help
but
notice
that
the
taste
in
his
mouth
be
exceedingly
bitter
he
knew
deep
down
that
the
bitterness
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
champagne
at
its
essence
it
be
simply
a
matter
of
physic
force
versus
an
equal
and
opposite
force
an
object
in
motion
tend
to
stay
in
motion
no
matter
how
unusual
unwanted
or
just
plain
annoy
that
motion
happen
to
be
force
equal
mass
time
velocity
there
simply
wasn
t
any
way
around
the
physic
of
it
at
pound
soak
wet
sean
parker
have
no
way
of
stop
the
oversize
mahogany
bureau
from
caterwaul
down
the
step
of
the
front
porch
of
the
compact
little
bungalow
so
he
didn
t
even
try
instead
he
just
stood
there
shake
his
head
as
the
damn
thing
roll
onto
its
side
land
with
an
ugly
thud
in
a
patch
of
grass
next
to
the
driveway
he
wait
for
a
few
second
listen
carefully
but
he
didn
t
hear
any
complaint
come
from
inside
the
house
which
be
a
very
good
thing
obviously
his
girlfriend
hadn
t
heard
the
thud
which
meant
that
if
he
could
get
the
now
slightly
damage
monstrous
piece
of
furniture
into
the
back
of
his
bmw
park
a
few
yard
away
in
the
driveway
of
the
house
she
d
never
be
the
wiser
he
bent
to
one
knee
put
his
hand
underneath
the
heavy
wood
and
give
it
a
solid
try
his
expensive
italian
drive
shoe
sank
a
few
inch
into
the
grass
as
his
face
turn
bright
red
with
the
effort
he
felt
his
lung
start
to
close
up
a
little
and
he
coughed
quickly
give
up
he
wonder
for
a
moment
if
a
few
hit
from
his
inhaler
would
make
the
task
any
less
impossible
probably
not
he
decide
more
likely
he
be
go
to
have
to
suck
it
up
and
ask
his
girlfriend
for
help
not
the
most
manly
of
option
but
then
again
he
d
be
crash
in
her
pad
for
much
of
the
last
semester
of
her
senior
year
at
stanford
and
now
that
she
be
move
back
home
it
might
be
nice
for
them
to
share
one
moment
of
domesticity
even
if
that
moment
consist
of
lug
a
hundred
pound
bureau
across
a
tranquil
bit
of
front
lawn
sean
parker
the
voice
come
out
of
nowhere
interrupt
sean
s
silent
contemplation
of
all
thing
bureau
related
he
look
up
then
realize
the
voice
have
come
from
behind
him
down
the
quiet
palo
alto
street
where
his
girlfriend
s
family
live
he
turn
on
his
heel
and
squint
as
the
sunlight
caught
him
straight
in
the
face
when
his
eye
adjust
he
make
out
four
young
guy
come
toward
him
strange
to
see
young
people
in
this
neighborhood
the
sleepy
town
wasn
t
exactly
the
hippest
part
of
the
suburban
community
a
pretty
little
warren
of
bungalow
style
home
swim
pool
and
manicure
lawn
maybe
even
with
the
odd
palm
tree
or
two
and
sean
guess
the
average
age
of
the
resident
be
a
good
thirty
year
old
than
these
kid
look
college
guy
he
assume
from
the
way
they
be
dress
sweatshirt
jean
and
one
gray
hood
fleece
between
them
sean
didn
t
recognize
any
of
the
kid
at
first
but
as
they
get
closer
he
suddenly
realize
that
he
do
indeed
know
one
of
them
this
be
a
bizarre
coincidence
he
murmur
figure
out
who
it
be
mark
zuckerberg
seem
as
shock
as
he
be
though
it
be
hard
to
read
the
kid
s
face
mark
quickly
introduce
his
roommate
and
explain
that
they
have
just
recently
move
into
a
house
right
in
the
neighborhood
in
fact
mark
point
out
the
house
which
be
barely
half
a
block
away
from
sean
s
girlfriend
s
family
mark
and
his
roomy
have
literally
stumble
on
sean
by
accident
although
sean
have
never
really
believe
in
accident
like
this
fate
fortune
call
it
whatever
you
like
but
his
whole
life
have
sometimes
seem
like
a
sequence
of
fortuitous
event
he
d
work
so
hard
to
track
mark
zuckerberg
down
in
new
york
and
now
out
here
in
california
the
boy
genius
have
stumble
right
into
his
lap
to
be
sure
since
the
dinner
at
he
and
mark
have
make
plan
a
couple
of
time
via
e
mail
to
try
to
meet
up
in
fact
only
a
few
week
earlier
they
have
hop
to
coincide
in
vega
at
some
high
tech
event
only
to
have
their
plan
fall
through
but
this
be
even
well
way
well
as
sean
explain
his
situation
that
he
be
move
his
girlfriend
into
her
parent
house
now
that
the
semester
have
conclude
that
he
be
go
to
be
stay
with
her
for
a
couple
of
day
but
after
that
he
would
be
temporarily
homeless
he
could
see
the
bright
light
go
off
behind
mark
s
eye
after
all
mark
have
come
to
silicon
valley
because
it
seem
like
the
right
place
to
go
to
build
an
internet
company
so
what
could
be
well
than
have
an
adviser
who
d
already
launch
two
of
the
most
talk
about
company
in
town
crash
in
the
same
house
mark
didn
t
make
any
formal
offer
but
sean
could
tell
that
the
option
would
be
there
if
it
be
something
he
be
interested
in
which
he
knew
it
would
be
he
d
want
to
get
involve
with
thefacebook
the
minute
he
d
see
the
web
site
if
all
go
well
he
be
go
to
be
living
with
the
guy
who
have
create
it
you
didn
t
get
more
involve
than
that
the
kid
be
fly
through
the
air
like
peter
pan
in
some
bizarre
high
school
production
except
instead
of
be
attach
to
a
safety
harness
and
a
guide
wire
he
be
hang
on
for
dear
life
to
a
makeshift
zip
line
that
have
be
run
from
the
base
of
a
chimney
on
the
top
of
the
house
all
the
way
to
a
telephone
pole
on
the
other
side
of
the
swim
pool
the
kid
be
scream
as
he
go
but
sean
could
tell
he
be
probably
more
drunk
than
scar
still
he
manage
to
launch
himself
at
exactly
the
right
moment
perform
an
airborne
spin
that
land
him
directly
in
the
center
of
the
pool
water
splash
outward
drench
an
outdoor
barbecue
and
even
reach
the
wooden
deck
that
stretch
around
the
back
side
of
the
house
on
la
jennifer
way
that
same
quiet
suburban
street
just
a
few
mile
outside
of
palo
alto
s
center
sean
couldn
t
have
be
more
pleased
by
the
setup
the
house
be
great
with
a
wonderful
frat
house
feel
to
it
even
though
mark
and
his
friend
have
only
recently
move
into
the
place
they
d
bought
the
zip

a
hundred
dollar
at
a
nearby
hardware
store
instal
it
themselves
with
only
minimal
damage
so
far
to
the
chimney
or
the
telephone
pole
the
interior
of
the
house
hadn
t
need
much
improvement
it
have
already
come
furnish
and
mark
and
his
friend
have
brought
little
with
them
maybe
a
bag
or
two
each
and
some
bedding
and
that
be
all
mark
s
parent

sent
some
fence
equipment
so
there
be
foil
and

picked
up
some
engineering
whiteboards
at
a
local
home

board
that
be
already
cover
with
the
scrawl
of
computer

numerous
bright
color

floor
of
the
house

litter
with
empty
pizza
box

and
the
cardboard
remains
of
a
fair
amount
of
computer
equipment
the
oversize
living
room
look
like
a
mix
between
a
dorm
room
and
an
engineering
lab
and
twenty
four
hour
a
day
there
be
someone
lock
into
one
of
the
multiple
laptop
or
desktop
that
be
strewn
about
wire
curl
everywhere
like
the
entrails
of
a
down
alien
spacecraft
the
sound
track
for
the
scene
be
a
mix
of
alternative
and
hardwired
rock
a
lot
of
green
day
sean
notice
which
seem
appropriate
for
a
group
of
hacker
type
with
anarchistic
streak
sean
be
likewise
happy
to
see
that
the
team
mark
have
assemble
be
perfect
engineering
soldier

the
making
of
a
real
brain
trust
the
work
ethic
in
the
house
be
spectacular
almost
literally
the
group
programmed
night
and
day
include
mark
especially
mark
when
they
weren
t
sleep
eat
or
hurl
themselves
into
the
swim
pool
via
the
zip

they
be
a
top
notch
crew
possibly
the
best
start
up
raw
material
sean
have
ever
see
the
one
person
sean
didn
t
see
in
the
house
be
eduardo
saverin
which
at
first
seem
confuse
since
back
in
new
york
eduardo
have
be
introduce
as
the
titular
business
head
of
thefacebook
and
have
certainly
make
it
very
clear
multiple
time
that
he
be
go
to
be
run
all
the
business
aspect
of
the
web
site
but
it
be
obvious
from
the
minute
sean
walk
into
the
la
jennifer
way
house
that
eduardo
wasn
t
involve
in
the
day
to
day
working
of
thefacebook
at
all
in
fact
eduardo
have
go
to
new
york
to
pursue
some
sort
of
internship
at
an
investment
bank
accord
to
mark
which
immediately
set
off
warn
bell
in
sean
s
mind
have
be
a
part
of
two
major
company
and
witness
many
more
success
and
failure
he
knew
that
the
most
important
aspect
of
a
start
up
be
the
energy
and
ambition
of
the
found
player
if
you
be
go
to
do
something
like
this
really
do
it
really
succeed
you
have
to
live
and
breathe
the
project
every
minute
of
every
day
mark
zuckerberg
be
living
it
he
have
the
drive
the
stamen
and
the
ability
he
be
obviously
a
genius
but
more
than
that
he
have
the
strange
unique
focus
that
be
necessary
to
pull
something
like
this
off
watch
him
program
at
four
five
in
the
morning
every
morning
sean
have
no
doubt
that
mark
have
the
making
of
one
of
the
truly
great
success
story
in
the
modern
revitalize
silicon
valley
but
where
be
eduardo
saverin
or
more
accurately
be
eduardo
saverin
even
part
of
the
equation
anymore
eduardo
have
seem
like
a
perfectly
nice
kid
and
of
course
he
d
be
there
in
the
begin
he
d
put
up
a
thousand
dollar
accord
to
mark
to
pay
for
the
first
server
and
it
be
his
money
at
the
moment
that
be
financing
the
current
operation
that
give
him
some
weight
sure
like
any
investor
in
a
start
up
but
beyond
that
eduardo
saw
himself
as
a
businessman
but
what
do
that
mean
exactly
silicon
valley
wasn
t
about
business
it
be
an
ongoing
war
you
have
to
do
thing
out
here
to
survive
that
weren
t
taught
in
any
business
class
hell
sean
have
never
even
go
to
college
he
d
start
napster
while
still
in
high
school
bill
gate
have
never
graduate
harvard
none
of
the
true
success
story
out
here
have
gotten
where
they
be
by
take
class
they
become
success
by
come
out
here
sometimes
with
just
a
duffel
bag
on
their
back
and
a
laptop
in
their
hand
eduardo
wasn
t
here
and
as
far
as
sean
could
tell
he
wasn
t
interested
in
be
here
so
sean
pretty
much
put
him
out
of
his
thought
he
have
mark
he
have
mark
s
team
he
have
thefacebook
with
his
help
he
truly
believe
they
could
build
this
company
into
the
billion
dollar
project
he
d
be
look
for
fate
have
put
him
in
the
right
place
for
the
third
time
hell
he
be
sleep
on
a
mattress
in
an
empty
corner
in
the
house
most
of
his
belonging
still
in
storage
somewhere
and
he
be
go
to
make
this
work
first
he
be
go
to
help
these
guy
figure
out
what
it
meant
to
be
a
part
of
this
revolution
because
the
way
sean
parker
saw
it
that
s
exactly
what
silicon
valley
be
all
about
a
constant
continue
revolution
he
be
go
to
show
them
this
world
like
only
he
could
look
around
this
house
at
these
guy
with
their
fence
equipment
and
their
pizza
box
he
could
tell
that
they
could
use
a
little
lesson
in
the
finer
way
of
living
this
life
after
all
they
be
create
a
premier
social
network
they
should
at
least
understand
what
it
meant
to
be
truly
social
sean
knew
he
be
just
the
guy
to
show
them
what
be
possible
he
be
a
rock
star
in
this
town
but
there
be
no
reason
that
mark
zuckerberg
couldn
t
eclipse
even
him
eventually
thefacebook
be
go
to
be
hot
which
meant
mark
for
all
his
awkwardness
for
all
his
flaw
he
be
go
to
become
the
toast
of
the
town
party
fancy
restaurant
girl
sean
could
show
him
the
way
to
all
of
it
as
for
eduardo
well
it
be
sad
that
the
kid
be
go
to
miss
out
on
the
next
stage
of
the
company
but
that
be
something
that
happen
all
the
time
in
this
game
eduardo
have
be
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
but
the
place
have
change
and
time
be
move
forward
at
the
speed
of
light
eduardo
might
try
to
hang
on
but
he
be
already
show
that
he
didn
t
have
what
it
take
poor
kid
sean
thought
to
himself
what
happens
when
the

he
knew
it
wasn
t

from
the
sound
of
the
night

to
have
to
hit

as

and
he
settle
back
against
the
narrow
coach
window
seat
try
to
get
comfortable
even
though
he
be
in
his
customary
jacket
and
tie
he
didn
t
think
he
be
go
to
have
trouble
sleep
during
the
six
hour
journey
he
have
be
burning

mostly
with
friend
from
the
phoenix
who
be
also
spending
the
summer
in
the
city
and
of
course
time
spent
with
kelly
who
be
now
call
herself
his
girlfriend
at
various
time
correctly
though
he
be
start
to
realize
that
she
be
a
bit
crazy
he
didn
t
regret
even
for
a
moment
that
he
have
quit
his
internship
on
the
very
first
day
really
minute
after
he
have
first
sat
down
in
the
little
cubicle
he
be
suppose
to
occupy
for
the
next
ten
week
and
have
star
at
that
pile
of
stock
valuation
he
be
suppose
to
analyze
when
he
d
realize
that
he
wasn
t
go
to
become
a
real
businessman
like
his
father
by
neglect
the
business
he
and
mark
have
cofounded
in
the
dorm
but
he
couldn
t
help
but
be
anxious
about
thefacebook
especially
late
at
night
wonder
how
thing
be
go
in
california
with
mark
and
the
rest
of
the
team
what
they
be
up
to
what
progress
they
have
make
and
why

often
he
roll
his
eye
at
himself
as
he
stretch
into
the
stiff
too
small
seat
maybe
he
be
start
to
think
like
the
crazy
girlfriend
he
be
already
consider
dump
maybe
be
a
little
jealous
wasn
t

for
himself
that

certain

the
rest
would
have
a
blast
get
some
work
do
and
everything
would
be
copacetic
and
it
would

also
be
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
more
investor
type
include
some
vcs
some
major
silicon

t
the
big

the
block
by
any
mean
but

it
seem
like

whiz
kid
behind
the
much
hyped
social

eduardo
couldn
t
help
but
grow
more
and
more
concerned
each
time
he
spoke
to
mark
and
heard
about
another
milestone
party
or
dinner
that
he
have
miss
by
be
in
new
york
bad
yet
mark
be
mark
hard
enough
to
read
in
person
but
on
the
phone
he
be
a
complete
mystery
sometimes
it
be
like
talk
to
a
computer
he
heard
what
you
say
digest
it
but
respond
only
if
he
felt
a
response
be
necessary
sometimes
he
didn
t
respond
at
all
if
he
be
thrill
that
eduardo
have
finally
make
some
real
progress
with
advertiser
specifically
land
a
deal
with
y
m
and
get
a
few
other
big
player
to
make
some
pretty
impressive
promise
he
certainly
wasn
t
show
it
to
be
fair
mark
and
his
team
be
work
round
the
clock
at
add
feature
to
the
site
and
signing
up
more
and
more
school
at
the
rate
they
be
go
they
would
surpass
five
hundred
thousand
member
by
the
end
of
august
a
pretty
spectacular
number
but
with
that
incredible
growth
there
come
new
problem
most
important
they
be
go
to
need
more
money
soon
the
company
be
still
run
off
of
the
eighteen
thousand
dollar
that
eduardo
have
deposit
into
the
bank
of
america
account
via
the
blank
check
he
d
give
mark
when
he
d
open
the
account
the
advertising
money
that
be
come
in
wasn
t
go
to
be
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
demand
five
hundred
thousand
user
would
burn
a
lot
of
server
space
and
pretty
soon
two
intern
would
not
be
enough
to
keep
the
company
run
they
d
have
to
hire
real
employee
get
a
real
office
hire
real
lawyer
etc
etc
etc
all
of
these
thing
eduardo
be
prepared
to
discus
as
soon
as
he
could
get
mark
alone
it
wasn
t
stuff
that
parker
need
to
hear
about
because
it
didn
t
concern
mark
s
houseguest
no
matter
how
many
party
he
take
them
to
eduardo
felt
a
sudden
buzzing
in
his
pocket
and
he
glance
around
the
plane
momentarily
confuse
then
he
realize
with
a
start
that
he
hadn
t
turn
his
cell
phone
off
he
hadn
t
be
get
reception
in
the
taxi
over
to
the
airport
but
it
must
have
finally
found
a
satellite
he
glance
out
the
window
saw
they
be
still
roll
along
the
tarmac
then
yanked
the
thing
out
of
his
pocket
when
he
look
at
the
screen
his
lip
turn
down
at
the
corner

paranoid
idea
that
they
be
go
to
be
party
with
girl
they
d
met
on
thefacebook
it
be
a
ridiculous
notion
although
to
be
fair
they
have
met
a
bunch
of
girl
over
thefacebook
and
more
than
that
they
be
become
pretty
well
know
on
and
off
campus
because
of
the
web
site
or
at
least
mark
be
christ
his
name
be
on
every
single
page
but
kelly
be
just
be
crazy
they
weren
t
go
to
be
party
with
random
girl
they
be
go
to
be
work
a
silicon
valley
scene
eduardo
texted
her
back
tell
her
to
calm
down
he
remember
that
he
d
left
her

gift
in
her
dorm
room
closet
the
last
time
he

new
jacket
still
wrap
up
in
a
gift
box
from
saks

he
told
her
to
open
it
and
that
he
be
think
about
her
and
not
to
worry
then
he
shut
off
the
phone
and
jammed
it
back
into
his
pocket
with
a
thrust
of
the
engine
the
plane
tipped
back
press
him
against
the
stiff
seat
didn
t
he
have
enough
to
worry
about
the
last
thing
he
need
to
deal
with
right
then
be
a
jealous
girlfriend
don
t
be
afraid
okay
be
afraid
but
it
run
pretty
well
eduardo
raise
his
eyebrow
as
he
follow
mark
out
of
the
terminal
and
caught
sight
of
the
car
park
right
up
against
the
curb
he
couldn
t
even
tell
what
make
it
be
but
it
be
really
old
and
the
whole
thing
be
tremble
it
look
like
one
of
the
tire
be
slightly
big
than
the
other
three
give
the
chassis
an
odd
sort
of
tilt
in
other
word
the
car
be
really
a
piece
of
crap
which
be
exactly
as
expect
since
mark
have
bought
the
thing
on
craigslist
just
a
couple
of
day
before
it
didn
t
even
use
a
key
you
start
it
by
fidget
with
the
ignition
the
good
thing
be
they
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
anyone
steal
it
eduardo
toss
his
duffel
bag
into
the
trunk
and
slid
into
the
backseat
dustin
be
drive
and
sean
parker
be
nowhere
to
be
see
mark
explain
that
sean
have
go
on
ahead
to
the
party
in
his
bmw
i
series
and
have
already
reserve
them
a
vip
table
he
d
left
their
name
with
the
doorman
so
they
d
have
no
problem
get
in
which
be
all
good
because
it
give
eduardo
time
to
reconnect
with
mark
on
the
drive
over
from
the
airport
mostly
it
be
him
talk
while
mark
listen
the
usual
nature
of
their
relationship
he
detailed
the
y
m
deal
and
the
progress
he
d
make
with
other
potential
advertiser
he
talk
a
bit
about
some
possible
financing
plan
about
some
idea
for
get
more
from
local
advertiser
in
each
of
thefacebook
location
then
he
told
mark
about
his
crazy
girlfriend
and
how
she
have
left
twelve
new
message
during
the
flight
from
new
york
mark
seem
to
take
it
all
in
but
his
one
word
response
didn
t
tell
eduardo
much
about
what
he
be
really
think
his
update
on
his
own
progress
on
what
have
be
go
on
in
california
for
the
past
month
on
sean
parker
and
the
intern
and
the
scene
be
his
usual
it
s
be
interest
which
wasn
t
helpful
at
all
meanwhile
the
city
flash
by
as
they
make
slow
progress
through
the
congest
narrow
street
of
the
glitter
city
on
the
hill
eduardo
thought
it
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
place
he
d
ever
see
but
strange
too
how
the
house
seem
to
be
built
right
on
top
of
one
another
how
the
wind
curve
street
some
with
cobblestone
and
wire
for
cable
car
ran
up
hill
that
be
almost
mountain
in
angle
and
height
how
you
go
from
one
corner
that
look
as
opulent
and
quaint
as
a
postcard
to
another
where
a
gang
of
shamble
homeless
stood
around
a
burning
trash
can
and
pretty
soon
it
be
more
homeless
and
less
opulence
as
they
pass
below
geary
and
enter
the
heart
of
the
tenderloin
district
the
club
be
beyond
o
farrell
locate
in
the
center
of
a
seedy
stretch
of
check
cash
joint
fast
food
restaurant
and
massage
parlor
as
they
pull
up
to
the
nondescript
entrance
eduardo
saw
a
huge
line
outside
and
a
large
man
in
a
black
suit
with
a
headset
by
the
door
this
look
promising
he
say
as
dustin
park
the
car
next
to
a
pile
of
trash
that
seem
to
swallow
a
good
portion
of
the
curb
the
homeless
men
nearby
didn
t
give
their
car
a
second
glance
a
lot
more
girl
in
line
than
guy
that
s
a
good
sign
they
get
out
of
the
car
and
approach
the
front
door

make
it
barely
ten
foot
into

crowd
when
he
heard
a
voice
over
the
music
from
the
direction
of
the
stair
he
caught
sight
of
sean

midway
up
to
the
vip
section
excitedly
wave
at
them
over
here

almost
five
minute
to
work
their
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
stair
where
they
have
to
tell
another
headsetted
bouncer
their
name
then
they
follow
sean
up
into
the
vip
and
join
him
at
one
of
the
circular
leather
line
table
he
pour
them
shot
from
a
bottle
of
ridiculously
expensive
vodka
when
they
be
seat
and
drinking
sean
launch
right
into
a
story
about
the
last
time
he
be
in
this
club
with
the
founder
of
paypal
after
some
award
ceremony
he
talk
really
fast
in
his
usual
eccentric
manner
and
he
be
so
jittery
spill
his
drink
on
the
table
tap
the
floor
with
his
little
bootlike
leather
shoe
but
sean
be
always
like
that
eduardo
knew
his
brain
just
ran
on
a
faster
set
than
everyone
else
s
while
sean
talk
eduardo
couldn
t
help
notice
the
table
next
to
theirs
because
it
be
fill
with
a
group
of
the
hottest
girl
he
d
ever
see
four
of
them
to
be
exact
each
one
hotter
than
the
next
two
blonde
in
black
cocktail
dress
their
bare
leg
so
long
they
seem
almost
alien
and
two
brunette
both
of
indeterminate
ethnic
origin
one
bulge
out
of
a
leather
bustier
while
the
other
be
barely
wear
a
wispy
summer
dress
that
could
easily
have
double
for
lingerie
it
take
eduardo
a
moment
to
realize
that
he
recognize
the
girl
and
that
they
be
in
fact
quite
literally
the
best
look
girl
he
d
ever
see
because
they
be
victoria
s
secret
model
right
from
the
catalog
and
then
he
saw
something
that
stun
him
even
more
while
sean
fritter
on
about
god
only
knew
what
one
of

ample
breast
be
barely
contain
by
her
bustier
her
tan
skin
have
sparkle
on
it
and
her
bare
shoulder
be
glow
under
the
strobing
light
she
be
gorgeous
and
she
be
talk
to
mark
he
couldn
t
imagine
what
the
conversation
could
possibly
be
about
or
how
it
have
begin
but
the
girl
seem
to
be
really
enjoy
herself

for
his
part
look
like
a
terrify
animal
caught
in
the
headlight
of
an
oncoming
truck
but
what
glorious
headlight
they
be

forward
and
touch

something
right

of
a
fairy
tale
some
of
the
original
building

and
tyler
and

much
of

narrow
street
with
their
host
family
hit
the
pub

mostly

but
despite
the
culture
they
d
experienced
during
the
week
they
d
come
to
henley
for
one
reason
to
race
in
the
grand
challenge
cup
against
the
best
crew

much
of
the

stream
out
of
the

sprawl
overly
prestigious

that
you
have
to
be
a
member
or
a
member
s
guest
to
enter

be
milling
about

the

much
shorter
in
person
but
tyler
be
quite
impressed
when
the
royal
shook
his
hand
and
seem
to
know
his
name
from
memory
the
mere
fact
that
albert
be
there
be
a
bit
of
good
luck
usually
it
be
a
lesser

but
albert
have
make
the

honor
of
his
grandfather
who
have
be
one
of

day
although
jack
kelly
have
ironically
be
ban
from

in
henley
because
of
his
bricklayer
background
which
albert
now
make

the
real
trophy

to
the
dutch

graciously
it

a
bit
bitter
watch

other
crew

trophy
above
their
head
but
tyler
be
a
good

but
nobody
seem
to
notice
the
heat
maybe
that
be
because
there

up

when

go
downhill
to
say
that
mark
have
be
unappreciative
of
eduardo

hard
work
in

would
be
an
understatement
in
eduardo

view

barely
listen
at
all
as
eduardo
explain
what
he

night
before

after
that
the
conversation

devolve
into
mark
s
usual
refrain
of
late
that
eduardo
should
move
out
to
california
because

where

intimate
that

his
time
in

when
everything
that

could
be
found
right
there
in

eduardo

try
to

a
grow

contact
but
mark
hadn
t
really
want
to
listen
to
him
at
all
and
then
to
make
matter
bad
sean
parker
have
jumped
on
the
phone
and
have
immediately
start
talk
about
two

would
happen
pretty
fast
eduardo
have
nearly
lose
it
right
there
on
the
phone
he
d
quickly
explain
to
parker

business
side
of

that
any
meeting
with
investor
would
have
to
include
him
and
why
the
hell
be
parker
set
up
these
sort
of
meeting
anyway
in
eduardo
s
mind
it
wasn
t
even
mark
s
job
to
be
look
for
potential
investor
he
be
suppose
to
just
run
the

and
parker
wasn
t
involve
at
all
he
be
a
houseguest
that
s
it
a
fuck
houseguest
after
that
first
phone
call
eduardo
s
emotion
have
start
to
shift
from
frustration
to
pure
anger
so
he
d
do
something
impetuous
maybe
out
of
that
anger
or
maybe
because
at
the
time
it
have
seem
the
proper
thing
to
do
to
clarify
his
feeling
and
let
mark
know
that
it
wasn
t
kosher
to
leave
him
out
of
the
loop
he
d
crashed
out
a
letter
reiterate
his
and
mark
s
business
relationship
specifically
he
d
respelled

d
start
thefacebook
that
eduardo
be
in
charge
of
the
business
side
of
the
company
and
that
mark
be
suppose
to
be
out
in
california
work
on
the
computer
code
furthermore
eduardo
have
add
that
since
he
own
percent
of
the
company
he
have
the
power
to
keep
them
from

any
financial
deal
that
he
do
not
agree
with
mark
have
to
accept
that
reality
and
eduardo
want
write
confirmation
that
he
could
run
the
business
side
of
thing
as
he
saw
fit
eduardo
have
know
when
he
d
write
the
thing
that
it
wasn
t
the
sort
of
letter
that
a
guy
like
mark
zuckerberg
would
react
well
to
but
eduardo
have
want
to
be
as
clear
as
possible
sure
sean
parker
have
take
them
to
some
cool
party
maybe
even
help
get
mark
laid
with
a
victoria
s
secret
model
but
in
eduardo
s
view
he
wasn
t
involve
in
thefacebook
eduardo
be
the
cfo
he
d
put
up
the
money
that
have
make
thefacebook
possible
he
be
still
the
one
funding
their
adventure
in
california
and
even
though
he
be
in
new
york
he
be
still
suppose
to
be
call
the
shot
after
receive
the
letter
mark
have
left
him
a
bunch
of
message
on
his
voice
mail
more
entreaty
for
eduardo
to
move
out
there
to
california
more
story
about
how
great
it
be
out
there
more
reassurance
that
everything
be
go
great
with
the
company
and
there
be
no
reason
for
them
to
bicker
about
stupid
thing
that
didn
t
matter
anyway
in
his
bizarre
worldview
finally
eduardo
have
call
him
back
just
a
little
while
ago
and
thing
have
go
from
bad
to
bad
mark
have
told
him
that
he
d
met
the
two
investor
sean
parker
have
told
eduardo
about
and
they
be
really
interested
in
make
an
angel
investment
basically
give
thefacebook
some
money
so
it
could
continue
grow
at
the
same
rapid
rate
thefacebook
need
the
money
since
it
be
begin
to
fall
into
serious
debt
the
more
people
who
be
signing
up
the
more
server
that
be
need
to
handle
the
traffic
and
soon
they
be
go
to
have
to
hire
more
people
to
handle
everything
that
be
go
on
but
to
eduardo
that
be
all
beside
the
point
in
his
opinion
mark
have
deliberately
ignore
the
sentiment
of
his
letter
and
be
take
business
meeting
without
eduardo
be
present
he
wasn
t
simply
step
on
eduardo
s
toe
he
and
sean
parker
seem
like
they
be
try
to
cut
off
eduardo
s
foot
maybe
mark
didn
t
think
eduardo
be
serious
that
the
letter
have
be
just
a
method
of
let
off
steam
and
maybe
it
be
in
a
way
but
mark
s
attitude
be
really
piss
eduardo
off
in
eduardo
s
opinion
they
be
out
there
living
it
up
in
california
on
eduardo
s
dime
the
house
in
california
the
computer
equipment
the
server
it
be
all
come
out
of
the
bank
account
that
eduardo
have
open
as
far
as
eduardo
be
concerned
that
eduardo
have
finance
from
his
own
personal
fund
eduardo
be
pay
for
everything
in
his
mind
and
mark
be
ignore
him
treat
him
like
an
angry
girlfriend
that
he
just
didn
t
give
a
shit
about
anymore
maybe
eduardo
be
overreact
but
now
three
day
later
fume
somewhere
in
new
york
he
be
grow
more
and
more
certain
that
he
have
to
do
something
to
show
mark
exactly
how
he
felt
he
have
to
send
a
message
one
that
mark
couldn
t
simply
ignore
we
can
picture
what
must
have
happen
next
eduardo
spin
through
the
revolve
glass
door
of
a
midtown
bank
of
america
office
his
face
a
mask
of
pure
determination
his
oxford
shirt
soak
with
sweat
from
either
a
subway
ride
or
twenty
minute
trap
in
a
traffic
bound
cab
he
move
right
past
the
teller
station
that
run
along
one
side
of
the
wide
rectangular
front
area
of
the
bank
and
head
directly
to
one
of
the
branch
associate
cubicle
by
the
time
the
balding
middle
age
banker
gesture
him
into
a
seat
and
asks
what
he
could
do
for
him
eduardo
have
already
pull
his
bankbook
out
of
his
pocket
he
slam
the
little
booklet
onto
the
desk
in
front
of
the
man
and
give
him
his
most
serious
adult
stare
i
want
to
freeze
my
bank
account
and
cancel
all
exist
check
and
line
of
credit
attach
to
this
account
as
the
man
begin
the
process
assuredly
eduardo
feel
a
burst
of
adrenaline
move
through
him
he
must
know
he
be
cross
a
line
but
this
be
go
to
send
mark
a
real
message
let
him
know
how
serious
eduardo
be
really
in
eduardo
s
mind
it
be
mark
s
own
fault
that
eduardo
even
have
the
power
to
do
such
a
thing
when
eduardo
have
first
open
the
bank
of
america
account
for
thefacebook
he
d
sent
mark
the
necessary
form
to
become
a
cosignatory
on
the
account
along
with
the
blank
check
that
be
funding
his
california
lifestyle
mark
be
mark
have
never
fill
out
the
paperwork
nor
have
he
ever
put
any
of
his
own
money
into
the
company
he
d
be
perfectly
content
to
live
off
of
eduardo
s
fund
as
if
eduardo
be
his
own
personal
banker
his
partner
except
now
he
have
start
to
make
decision
without
eduardo
s
involvement
and
eduardo
have
to
let
him
know
that
it
simply
wasn
t
okay
eduardo
have
to
let
mark
know
what
it
meant
to
be
a
good
partner
eduardo
didn
t
care
if
every
thefacebook
page
be
a
mark
zuckerberg
production
but
the
company
itself
be
the
result
of
a
combine
effort
eduardo
be
a
businessman
and
this
move
be
all
business
as
eduardo
watch
the
banker
hit
the
necessary
key
on
his
computer
to
freeze
thefacebook
s
bank
account
maybe
he
wonder
for
the
briefest
of
second
if
he
be
go
too
far
if
he
do
he
can
cancel
the
thought
with
another
a
picture
of
mark
and
sean
run
around
california
in
parker
s
bmw
take
meeting
with
investor
maybe
even
laugh
at
eduardo
s
effort
to
rein
them
in
they
wouldn
t
be
laugh
when
they
try
to
cash
the
next
blank
check
that
be
for
sure
this
time
the
revolution
wasn
t
go
to
begin
with
a
bang
instead
sean
parker
realize
it
be
go
to
start
with
the
whir
of
a
state
of
the
art
elevator
speed
up
the
spine
of
a
massive
san
francisco
skyscraper
and
the
sickly
soft
chord
of
a
brutally
mangle
beatles
song
pumped
through
speaker
embed
above
the
fluorescent
light
that
lit
the
carpet
cubic
lift
sean
have
to
admit
there
be
something
strangely
poetic
about
the
set
this
be
potentially
the
begin
of
the
next
great
digital
social
seismic
change
and
the
only
thing
that
marked
the
second
tick
away
toward
that
epochal
event
be
the
horrific
beat
of
can
muzak
he
stifle
the
urge
to
grin
as
he
stood
next
to
mark
in
the
center
of
the
otherwise
empty
elevator
star
up
at
the
little
glow
number
that
tracked
their
progress
up
the
skyscraper
at
the
moment
they
be
somewhere
between
the
ninth
and
tenth
floor
of
the
fifty
two
story
building
move
upward
at
an
incredible
pace
sean
felt
his
ear
pop
from
the
change
in
altitude
which
be
a
good
thing
for
the
briefest
of
second
he
couldn
t
hear
the
muzak
which
allow
him
to
order
his
thought
or
at
least
corral
them
in
as
close
to
a
semblance
of
order
as
his
highly
energize
gray
matter
would
allow
thing
be
happen
quickly
much
faster
even
than
sean
himself
have
expect
he
d
only
just
a
few
week
ago
move
in
with
the
eccentric
genius
stand
next
to
him
in
the
elevator
and
now
here
they
be
on
their
way
to
a
meeting
that
could
very
well
launch
them
into
a
partnership
that
would
change
the
face
of
the
internet
itself
and
put
them
well
on
their
way
toward
the
billion
dollar
payoff
sean
have
envision
when
he
first
saw
thefacebook
in
that
dorm
room
on
the
stanford
campus
sean
glance
toward
the
twenty
year
old
kid
stand
next
to
him
if
mark
be
nervous
he
didn
t
show
it
or
more
accurately
he
didn
t
look
any
more
uncomfortable
or
anxious
than
usual
his
face
be
a
mask
of
indifference
his
eye
train
on
those
same
ascend
number
above
the
elevator
door
since
they
d
run
into
each
other
on
the
street
outside
of
palo
alto
sean
have
gotten
to
know
the
eccentric
kid
pretty
well
and
he
be
genuinely
begin
to
like
him
certainly
mark
be
strange
socially
awkward
didn
t
begin
to
describe
his
standoffish
mannerism
but
even
despite
the
wall
the
kid
have
built
around
himself
sean
could
tell
that
his
initial
opinion
of
the
boy
genius
be
not
far
off
mark
be
brilliant
ambitious
and
have
a
caustic
sense
of
humor
for
the
most
part
he
be
a
quiet
person
sean
have
take
him
to
numerous
party
but
mark
be
never
comfortable
at
any
of
them
he
be
much
happier
lodge
in
front
of
his
computer
sometimes
twenty
hour
at
a
stretch
he
still
have
that
college
girlfriend
whom
he
saw
about
once
a
week
and
he
like
to
take
long
drive
when
he
get
tire
of
the
computer
but
otherwise
he
be
a
cod
machine
he
live
breathe
and
ate
the
company
he
have
create
sean
could
not
have
ask
for
more
from
a
fledgling
entrepreneur
in
fact
sometimes
he
have
to
remind
himself
that
the
kid
stand
next
to
him
be
barely
twenty
year
old
his
lifestyle
be
still
somewhat
immature
but
his
focus
be
amaze
and
sean
be
certain
he
be
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
necessary
to
continue
grow
his
web
site
which
be
exactly
why
sean
felt
certain
that
the
step
they
be
about
to
take
be
the
right
one
that
the
meeting
they
be
hurtle
toward
would
be
the
catalyst
to
that
billion
dollar
payoff
that
have
elude
him
through
two
successful
start
ups
and
half
a
decade
navigate
the
bust
and
boom
of
a
newly
reemergent
silicon
valley
in
a
weird
way
sean
have
eduardo
saverin
to
thank
for
push
thing
to
a
head
so
rapidly
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
eduardo
s
action
over
the
past
couple
of
week
it
might
have
take
an
entire
summer
to
get
mark
to
this
point
but
eduardo
have
do
the
job
of
push
mark
to
make
a
big
move
forward
for
sean
in
the
most
bizarre
and
unexpected
fashion
first
there
have
be
that
idiotic
letter
sean
thought
it
be
like
a
kidnapper
s
ransom
letter
really
it
might
as
well
have
be
write
in
cut
out
word
from
newspaper
and
color
magazine
threaten
cajole
demand
the
kid
have
some
serious
self
awareness
issue
he
need
to
deal
with
the
very
idea
that
he
be
run
the
business
side
of
an
internet
company
from
new
york
while
the
rest
of
his
partner
be
actually
building
the
site
out
in
california
be
the
height
of
absurdity
and
then
try
to
hold
his
percent
ownership
over
mark
like
it
be
some
sort

eduardo
have
go
right
off
his
rocker
still
mark
have
try
to
be
reasonable
with
his
friend
and
sean
have
be
right
there
with
him
try
to
smooth
thing
over
there
be
really
no
need
to
turn
the
letter
into
more
than
it
be
a
desperate
childish
plea
to
be
more
include
in
what
be
go
on
with
the
company
which
mark
certainly
could
have
accepted
but
before
mark
and
his
friend
have
work
anything
out
eduardo
have
go
and
cross
the
line
he
d
frozen
the
company
s
bank
account
effectively
cut
mark
and
dustin
off
at
the
throat
with
that
single
act
he
d
take
a
shot
at
the
soul
of
the
company
itself
whether
he
realize
it
or
not
his
action
could
easily
have
destroyed
everything
mark
have
work
on
because
without
money
the
company
couldn
t
function
if
the
server
go
down
for
even
a
day
it
would
hurt
the
reputation
of
thefacebook
possibly
in
an
irrevocable
way
user
be
fickle
friendster
have
proven
that
fact
time
and
again
if
people
decide
to
leave
the
web
site
well
then
that
could
quickly
have
turn
disastrous
even
a
small
scale
exodus
would
reverberate
through
the
whole
user
base
because
all
of
the
user
be
interconnect
college
kid
be
online
because
their
friend
be
online
one
domino
go
a
dozen
more
follow
maybe
eduardo
hadn
t
really
understood
what
he
be
do
maybe
he
d
act
out
of
anger
frustration
god
knew
what
but
simply
put
in
sean
s
view
his
childish
maneuver
have
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
stay
a
big
part
of
the
company
go
forward
and
in
sean
s
mind
it
really
have
be
the
act
of
a
child
not
the
businessman
eduardo
saw
himself
as
like
a
little
kid
on
the
playground
scream
at
his
friend
if
you
don
t
do
thing
my
way
i
m
take
my
toy
and
go
home
well
eduardo
have
take
his
toy
and
now
mark
have
make
a
decision
that
be
go
to
change
thefacebook
in
way
eduardo
couldn
t
imagine
first
under
sean
s
guidance
mark
have
reincorporated
the
company
as
a
delaware
llc
to
protect
it
from
saverin
s
whim
and
also
to
begin
the
restructuring
that
sean
knew
would
be
necessary
to
raise
the
money
the
company
need
to
go
forward
at
the
same
time
mark
have
gather
what
resource
he
could
and
put
his
own
money
into
keep
the
company
alive
for
the
moment
until
they
could
set
thing
right
draw
from
his
own
college
saving
money
that
have
be
earmark
for
his
tuition
mark
have
manage
to
come
up
with
enough
to
keep
the
server
run
for
the
time
be
but
the
company
be
rapidly
head
toward
real
financial
trouble
something
mark
could
no
longer
ignore
furthermore
it
wasn
t
just
the
server
or
the
need
for
new
employee
that
be
go
to
be
a
problem
to
add
to
everything
else
just
a
few
day
before
they
d
receive
a
letter
from
a
law
firm
that
have
be
hire
by
the
connectu
founder
the
winklevoss
twin
the
jocky
senior
who
have
hire
mark
to
work
on
some
date
site
back
when
he
be
still
in
school
the
letter
be
the
first
step
in
the
initiation
of
a
lawsuit
a
sort
of
warn
shot
at
thefacebook
s
bow
as
sean
saw
it
even
before
the
letter
from
the
law
firm
sean
have
spoken
at
length
with
mark
about
the
connectu
situation
and
he
d
also
do
some
research
of
his
own
into
the
situation
in
his
mind
the
winklevoss
twin
be
a
nuisance
but
not
a
real
danger
to
the
future
of
the
company
a
mild
concern
at
best
in
sean
s
opinion
their
claim
be
unfounded
and
overblown
so
mark
have
do
a
little
work
for
their
date
site
before
come
up
with
the
idea
for
thefacebook
so
what
there
be
a
hundred
social
network
out
there
every
computer
geek
in
every
dorm
room
be
work
on
some
program
like
thefacebook
that
didn
t
mean
they
be
all
subject
to
lawsuit
and
all
these
social
network
be
pretty
similar
at
their
core
mark
s
own
argument
that
there
be
an
infinite
number
of
design
for
a
chair
but
that
doesn
t
mean
everyone
who
make
a
chair
be
steal
from
someone
else
seem
as
good
as
any
to
sean
if
anything
they
be
all
borrowing
from
friendster
when
it
come
right
down
to
it
the
connectu
twin
hadn
t
exactly
invent
the
wheel
that
be
for
sure
mark
have
do
nothing
wrong
nothing
that
every
other
entrepreneur
in
the
valley
hadn
t
do
a
dozen
time
before
even
so
if
the
twin
persist
and
the
legal
letter
seem
to
indicate
that
they
would
it
be
go
to
cost
mark
upward
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollar
to
defend
himself
which
meant
he
need
to
raise
more
money
fast
and
since
sell
the
company
wasn
t
an
option
not
in
sean
or
mark
s
mind
that
be
certain
they
need
an
angel
investment
to
tide
them
over
until
they
could
reach
a
valuation
that
would
make
all
these
problem
seem
petty
and
insignificant
sean
only
wish
he
have
that
sort
of
money
but
the
way
thing
have
work
out
with
napster
and
plaxo
parker
didn
t
have
anywhere
close
to
what
mark
would
need
to
keep
thefacebook
afloat
so
instead
sean
do
what
he
do
best
he
make
a
connection
one
that
he
be
pretty
sure
be
go
to
be
the
key
to
what
have
to
happen
next
to
make
thefacebook
into
what
he
knew
it
could
be
watch
the
number
sprint
upward
as
the
elevator
brought
them
closer
and
closer
to
their
goal
sean
knew
that
once
again
he
d
do
exactly
the
right
thing
all
mark
have
to
do
be
ace
the
meeting
and
they
be
on
their
way
he
threw
another
sideways
glance
at
the
boy
wonder
and
again
get
nothing
in
return
he
remind
himself
that
mark
s
silence
didn
t
mean
anything
the
kid
would
be
able
to
perform
when
the
time
come
all
sean
need
from
him
be
fifteen
minute
you
know
they
film
tower
inferno
here
right
sean
say
try
to
keep
the
mood
in
the
elevator
light
and
easy
he
thought
he
saw
the
slightest
sliver
of
a
smile
on
mark
s
lip
that
s
comfort
mark
robotically
respond
sean
be
pretty
sure
he
be
be
ironic
and
he
allow
himself
that
grin
he
d
be
fight
it
really
be
a
fitting
place
for
the
meeting
not
because
of
the
movie
but
because
it
be
one
of
the
most
impressive
landmark
in
the
city
formerly
the
bank
of
america
center
the
behemoth
at
california
street
be
an
architectural
wonder
an
enormous
polished
granite
tower
with
thousand
of
bay
window
that
could
be
see
for
mile
a
foot
spire
rise
right
out
of
the
epicenter
of
the
city
s
financial
district
and
the
man
they
be
on
their
way
to
meet
well
he
be
nearly
as
impressive
as
the
building
itself
both
in
personal
reputation
and
in
what
he
have
already
achieve
peter
s
go
to
love
you
sean
respond
fifteen
minute
in
and
out
that
s
all
it
s
go
to
take
deep
down
he
be
certain
that
he
be
right
peter

the
richest
men
in
the
country
be
intimidate
fast
talk
and
a
true
genius
but
he
be
also
exactly
the
sort
of
angel
investor
who
have
the
gut
and
the
foresight
to
understand
how
important
how
groundbreaking
thefacebook
have
the
potential
to
be
because
thiel
like
sean
parker
and
mark
zuckerberg
be
more
than
just
an
entrepreneur
he
saw
himself
as
a
revolutionary
a
former

thiel
be
a
well
know
libertarian
during

school
he
d
found
the
stanford

and
he
be
a
firm
believer
in
the
value
of
the
free
exchange
of
information
that
thefacebook
celebrate
within
its
social
network
though
secretive
and
incredibly
competitive
thiel
be
always
search
for
the
next
big
thing
and
sean
knew
that
he
share
his
own
interest
in
the
social
networking
space
sean
have
never
work
directly
with
thiel
before
but
he
d
be
involve
in
get
thiel
invest
minorly
in
friendster
and
he
d
always
kept
the
former
paypal
ceo
in
the
back
of
his
mind
in
case
another
opportunity
ever
arose
the

and

toward

where
thiel

from

and
also
the

and
cofounder

to
hear
the
pitch
from
the
quirky
kid
who
d
lately
be
take
the
internet
world
by
storm
if
thiel
like
what
he
heard
well
sean
could
think
of
no
well
way
to
put
it
the
revolution
that
be
thefacebook
would
truly
and
earnestly
begin
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
three
hour
later
the
number
reverberate
through
sean
s
skull
as
he
stood
in
near
silence
in
the
rapidly
descend
elevator
next
to
mark
watch
those
same
glow
number
count
back
down
as
they
hurtle
back
toward
the
lobby
of
the
great
granite
building
at
california
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
in
the
general
scheme
of

of
course

huge
number
it
wasn
t

it
wasn
t
empire
make

it
wasn
t
fuck
you
money

even
as
much
money
as
mark
have
once
turn
down
back
in
high
school
when
he
d
create
that
mp
player
add
on
simply
because
he
didn
t
really
give
a
damn
about
money
whether
it
be
a
thousand
dollar
borrow
from
a
friend
to
start
a
company
or
a
million
dollar
thrown
his
way
from
an
even
big
company
as
far
as
sean
could
tell
mark
still
didn
t
really
give
a
damn
about
money
but
he
couldn
t
ignore
the
sentiment
that
come
with
those
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
the
promise
of
a
future
for
the
company
that
he
d
start
in
that
harvard
dorm
room
peter
thiel
have
be
exactly
everything
that
sean
have
prepared
mark
for
scary
as
hell
brilliant
as
hell
and
willing
to
play
ball
more
than
that
he
d
turn
a
fifteen
minute
pitch
meeting
into
a
lunch
and
an
afternoon
spent
go
over
the
detail
of
the
deal
that
would
ensure
thefacebook
s
survival
once
and
for
all
at
one
point
sean
and
mark
have
even
be
sent
out
of
the
meeting
to
walk
around
town
while
thiel
and
hoffman
and
kohler
discuss
their
pitch
but
by
the
end
of
the
afternoon
thiel
have
give
them
the
great
news
thefacebook
be
on
its
way
or
as
the
company
be
now
go
to
be
call
just
facebook
sean
s
idea
because
he
d
be
so
damn
annoyed
by
that
the
in
the
web
site
s
name
he
d
finally
go
and
gotten
mark
to
slice
it
right
off
in
the
reorganization
that
be
now
an
inevitability
a
necessary
step
in
get
that
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
angel
investment
that
be
go
to
save
all
their
neck
seed
money
thiel
have
call
it
enough
to
get
them
through
the
next
few
month
and
along
with
it
a
promise
of
more
when
the
time
come
when
the
need
arose
in
exchange
thiel
be
go
to
get
about
percent
of
the
newly
form
company
and
a
seat
on
the
five
man
board
of
director
that
would
lead
the
company
go
forward
mark
would
still
control
the
majority
of
the
seat
and
thus
the
company
itself
he
d
also
keep
the
lion
s
share
of
the
company
s
stock
even
in
its
new
iteration
but
thiel
would
become
a
guide
force
lead
them
forward
along
with
sean
and
mark
it
simply
didn
t
get
any
well
than
that
stand
there
in
that
elevator
listen
to
the
muzak
some
roll
stone
bastardization
that
make
sean
want
to
vomit
on
the
inside
it
be
an
overwhelm
moment
still
sean
knew
that
there
be
work
to
be
do
he
knew
that
this
re
formation
of
the
company
be
go
to
create
a
pretty
intense
situation
reincorporating
be
necessary
both
thiel
and
he
have
agree
facebook
have
to
become
a
new
entity
shed
its
dorm
room
genesis
and
move
into
a
sort
of
new
testament
status
they
be
go
to
have
to
reissue
share
to
represent
the
new
setup
to
include
thiel
and
of
course
sean
himself
who
d
be
work
as
a
partner
to
mark
since
he
d
move
into
the
house
anyway
and
dustin
and
chris
which
left
the
question
of
eduardo
initially
mark
have
decide
and
sean
have
agree
eduardo
would
still
get
his
percent
the
intention
be
to
include
eduardo
and
involve
him
as
much
as
he
want
to
be
involve
but
the
new
corporation
would
have
different
rule
it
have
to
have
different
rule
there
just
wasn
t
any
way
to
run
a
business
without
the
ability
to
issue
more
share
as
be
necessitate
by
the
evolve
situation
go
forward
people
have
to
be
give
share
base
on
the
amount
of
work
any
particular
individual
give
to
the
company
this
wasn
t
some
dorm
room
project
anymore
this
be
a
real
company
with
a
real
investor
people
have
to
be
reimburse
as
if
this
be
any
other
company
because
otherwise
it
would
be
impossible
to
create
a
real
valuation
base
on
what
facebook
achieve
which
meant
that
if
mark
dustin
and
sean
be
do
all
the
work
to
make
the
company
successful
they
would
get
issue
more
share
if
eduardo
be
in
new
york
work
on
find
more
advertising
partner
he
would
get
share
accordingly
but
if
he
didn
t
produce
well
he
would
be
dilute
just
like
anyone
and
everyone
else
hell
if
they
need
to
raise
more
money
in
the
future
they
would
all
be
dilute
from
sean
s
point
of
view
eduardo
have
do
a
horrible
thing
he
d
threaten
the
very
company
during
its
most
fragile
stage
mark
didn
t
seem
to
hate
eduardo
for
it
mark
didn
t
have
the
capacity
or
the
interest
to
hate
anyone
but
in
sean
s
view
eduardo
have
show
where
he
stood
to
mark
and
dustin
and
sean
facebook
be
everything
it
be
their
life
in
fact
mark
have
told
thiel
in
the
meeting
that
he
d
probably
not
even
return
to
harvard
when
the
summer
end
he
be
go
to
stay
in
california
and
continue
the
adventure
he
d
take
it
month
by
month
but
if
facebook
kept
progress
he
didn
t
envision
return
to
harvard
anytime
soon
like
bill
gate
have
say
if
microsoft
didn
t
work
out
he
could
always
go
back
to
harvard
sure
if
facebook
didn
t
work
out
mark
could
always
go
back
to
school
but
sean
doubt
he
ever
would
he
be
go
to
continue
his
endless
summer
and
most
likely
dustin
would
stay
on
in
california
as
well
but
eduardo
well
from
what
sean
knew
of
the
kid
eduardo
would
never
quit
school
he
d
already
proven
that
he
wasn
t
go
to
give
up
everything
else
for
facebook
that
simply
wasn
t
who
he
be
he
have
other
interest
for
instance
back
at
harvard
from
what
sean
understood
he
have
the
phoenix
in
new
york
he
d
have
that
internship
even
though
he
d
quit
in
the
first
week
eduardo
would
go
back
to
school
but
mark
zuckerberg
have
found
his
place
in
the
world
sean
watch
the
number
descend
the
excitement
finally
start
to
die
down
inside
him
he
force
his
pulse
to
return
to
a
steady
beat
like
the
steady
byte
and
bit
of
a
processing
computer
hard
drive
he
knew
that
there
be
still
obstacle
ahead
so
much
work
still
to
be
do
first
and
foremost
mark
would
probably
have
to
get
eduardo
to
agree
to
the
legal
detail
just
to
make
thing
cleaner
from
a
lawyer
s
point
of
view
as
harsh
as
it
sound
from
a
practical
point
of
view
eduardo
should
understand
this
wasn
t
a
personal
issue
it
be
business
and
eduardo
saw
himself
first
and
foremost
as
a
businessman
sean
and
peter
be
successful
entrepreneur
and
they
have
explain
to
mark
how
all
this
work
start
up
company
like
facebook
really
have
two
distinct
start
point
there
be
the
first
start
point
some
kid
in
a
dorm
room
hack
around
on
a
computer
then
there
be
the
second
start
point
here
in
a
skyscraper
in
downtown
san
francisco
if
you
be
there
in
the
dorm
room
you
have
an
excite
and
wonderful
story
to
tell
you
get
to
be
part
of
something
really
cool
that
spark
of
genius
that
flame
bursting
up
out
of
nowhere
that
lightning
bolt
of
imagination
if
you
be
there
in
the
skyscraper
well
that
be
something
very
different
that
be
the
real
begin
of
the
company
with
a
capital
c
that
be
the
real
business
the
corporation
the
second
lightning
bolt
that
really
take
you
straight
up
into
the
heaven
really
it
be
something
eduardo
should
understand
it
wasn
t
about
two
kid
in
a
dorm
room
anymore
and
if
he
didn
t
get
it
if
he
didn
t
understand
if
he
didn
t
want
to
understand
well
in
many
way
if
eduardo
didn
t
get
it
then
in
sean
s
opinion
he
didn
t
really
care
about
facebook
the
same
way
they
do
then
he
be
no
well
than
the
winklevoss
twin
try
to
grasp
onto
mark
s
ankle
as
he
head
toward
the
heaven
either
way
mark
have
to
know
he
be
make
the
right
decision
for
the
company
sean
and
thiel
have
make
it
clear
no
investor
be
go
to
hand
them
money
with
some
kid
run
around
new
york
claim
to
be
the
head
of
the
business
side
of
the
company
flaunt
some
percent
ownership
status
hold
it
over
them
like
a
saber
ready
to
chop
off
their
head
freeze
their
bank
account
threaten
them
threaten
facebook
that
s
what
it
all
come
down
to
facebook
the
company
the
revolution
sean
could
tell
that
s
all
mark
care
about
now
he
knew
he
be
on
top
of
something
huge
this
mark
zuckerberg
production
be
go
to
change
the
world
like
napster
but
big
facebook
be
all
about
freedom
of
information
a
truly
digital
social
network
put
the
real
world
onto
the
internet
eduardo
would
have
to
understand
and
if
he
didn
t
then
in
the
large
scheme
of
thing
he
didn
t
matter
he
didn
t
exist
stand
there
in
the
elevator
sean
thought
about
the
last
thing
peter
thiel
have
say
to
mark
after
make
the
deal
that
would
take
the
company
to
the
next
level
right
after
tell
mark
that
when
they
get
to
three
million
facebook
member
he
could
take
thiel
s
ferrari
spyder
out
for
a
drive
right
after
fill
out
the
paperwork
that
would
enable
mark
to
draw
on
that
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
in
seed
money
to
build
facebook
however
he
want
as
big
as
he
could
dream
thiel
have
lean
forward
over
his
desk
and
look
mark
right
in
the
eye
just
don
t
fuck
it
up
sean
grin
as
he
star
at
the
glow
number
above
the
elevator
door
thiel
have
nothing
to
worry
about
sean
knew
his
new
friend
mark
zuckerberg
wasn
t
go
to
let
anyone
fuck
facebook
up
he
be
go
to
lead
this
revolution
no
matter
what
the
cost
if
eduardo
have
squint
real
hard
maybe
spun
himself
around
a
little
he
could
have
be
right
back
in
mark
s
messy
dorm
room
in
kirkland
house
watch
his
friend
plug
away
at
his
laptop
even
the
furniture
in
the
open
central
office
of
the
new
rental
casa
facebook
in
los
alto
california
look
like
it
have
be
ship
in
from
harvard
scuffed
wooden
chair
futon
worn
desk
and
couch
that
seem
a
dorm
room
chic
mix
of
ikea
and
the
salvation
army
out
back
the
porch
be
speckle
with
paintball
shot
and
there
be
cardboard
box
everywhere
make
it
seem
like
they
be
a
team
of
squatter
more
than
a
start
up
operation
in
full
swing
of
course
there
be
computer
everywhere
on
the
desk
on
the
floor
on
the
counter
next
to
box
of
cereal
and
bag
of
potato
chip
but
even
with
all
the
hardware
the
house
have
the
feel
of
a
college
dorm
which
be
exactly
what
mark
and
the
rest
have
be
go
for
even
though
they
be
now
work
round
the
clock
at
that
very
minute
mark
and
dustin
be
behind
computer
screen
plug
away
while
two
young
men
in
suit
lawyer
eduardo
knew
from
the
firm
the
company
have
contract
to
handle
the
new
incorporation
contract
among
other
thing
shuffle
around
by
the
door
that
lead
to
the
kitchen
they
do
not
want
to
lose
the
college
feel
of
the
company
because
it
would
always
be
at
its
heart
a
college
experiment
go
viral
and
despite
the
somewhat
choreographed
chaos
this
five
bedroom
house
be
still
more
suit
for
mark
and
the
gang
than
the
previous
one
in
suburban
palo
alto
not
that
the
move
have
entirely
be
mark
s
choice
after
a
series
of
complaint
letter
and
visit
from
the
landlord
they
d
be
pretty
much
kick
out
of
the
la
jennifer
way
sublet
for
among
other
thing
climb
on
the
roof
play
music
too
loud
throw
patio
furniture
into
the
pool
and
damage
the
chimney
with
the
zip
line
eduardo
have
a
pretty
good
feel
that
they
wouldn
t
be
get
the
security
deposit
back
anytime
soon
which
be
okay
now
because
facebook
have
its
own
financing
in
place
an
angel
investment
from
peter
thiel
which
be
pay
for
this
new
house
all
this
computer
equipment
more
server
than
eduardo
have
imagine
they
d
ever
need
and
the
lawyer
who
have
greet
eduardo
with
smile
and
handshake
when
he
d
enter
the
house
after
the
long
flight
and
taxi
ride
that
have
brought
him
in
from
cambridge
that
very
morning
eduardo
have
slept
most
of
the
trip
eight
week
into
the
new
school
year
his
senior
year
and
he
be
already
exhaust
even
though
he
be
take
a
bit
of
a
reduce
class
load
so
that
he
could
continue
his
work
on
facebook
there
be
always
so
much
to
do
at
harvard
from
the
thesis
he
be
already
work
on
for
his
major
to
the
investment
association
which
he
be
still
a
part
of
and
of
course
the
phoenix
which
kept
his
weekend
fill
especially
since
he
be
single
after
have
broken
up
with
kelly
and
now
that
it
be
the
begin
of
another
punch
season
it
be
his
turn
to
help
pick
the
new
crop
of
campus
social
king
on
top
of
all
that
of
course
there
be
facebook
eduardo
lean
back
in
his
chair
which
be
position
to
the
side
of
a
round
table
that
take
up
most
of
the
center
of
the
main
office
in
the
house
and
watch
mark
as
he
work
away
at
his
laptop
computer
the
glow
of
the
screen
splash
across
mark
s
pallid
cheek
tiny
sequence
of
code
reflect
across
the
bluish
globe
of
his
eye
mark
have
barely
greet
him
when
he
d
first
come
into
the
house
really
just
a
nod
and
a
word
or
two
but
that
wasn
t
unusual
nor
do
eduardo
read
anything
into
it
actually
thing
have
be
go
quite
well
between
them
over
the
past
eight
week
since
he
d
be
back
at
school
the
rocky
few
week
of
summer
seem
almost
forgotten
now
mark
have
be
pretty
piss
off
about
the
bank
account
situation
and
he
d
go
right
ahead
with
the
investor
meeting
that
have
lead
to
the
financing
from
thiel
despite
eduardo
s
wish
they
d
have
it
out
on
the
phone
a
number
of
time
argue
like
any
two
friend
might
who
be
involve
in
something
that
have
gotten
big
than
either
of
them
have
really
expect
but
they
d
come
to
a
sort
of
d
tente
finally
agree
that
the
important
thing
be
the
company
that
it
continued
move
forward
in
a
smooth
fashion
eduardo
have
probably
overreact
with
the
bank
account
and
mark
have
be
a
bit
distant
and
selfish
by
keep
eduardo
out
of
the
loop
but
eduardo
be
willing
to
be
reasonable
and
move
forward
for
the
good
of
the
company
this
be
business
and
they
be
friend
they
would
find
a
way
to
work
thing
out
to
that
end
mark
have
ask
that
eduardo
step
back
a
little
to
ease
his
own
concern
and
also
so
that
eduardo
could
focus
on
finish
up
school
he
d
convince
eduardo
that
the
company
be
get
too
big
for
one
person
to
try
to
control
all
the
business
side
of
thing
that
it
be
simply
impossible
what
he
d
be
demand
as
thing
continued
to
grow
they
be
closing
in
on
user
now
head
toward
a
million
mark
and
dustin
be
take
time
off
from
college
maybe
a
semester
probably
not
longer
and
they
be
also
planning
on
hire
a
sale
executive
to
pick
up
the
slack
handle
some
of
the
thing
eduardo
have
be
work
on
in
new
york
they
be
also
rapidly
add
function
to
the
site
some
of
them
quite
incredible
they
d
create
something
call
a
wall
where
people
could
communicate
with
one
another
in
a
very
open
format
that
hadn
t
really
be
see
before
on
any
social
network
and
there
be
now
group
available
for
people
to
join
and
create
an
idea
eduardo
have
talk
about
with
mark
back
when
they
be
first
come
up
with
the
site
the
pace
of
invention
be
just
incredible
almost
mimic
the
viral
growth
of
the
user
base
in
the
end
eduardo
after
have
calm
down
a
bit
from
his
burst
of
anger
back
in
july
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
mark
be
go
to
do
thing
mark
s
way
and
now
that
the
summer
be
over
and
eduardo
be
back
in
school
he
be
probably
well
off
anyway
the
important
thing
be
that
the
company
be
thrive
with
thiel
s
money
eduardo
wasn
t
risk
his
own
cash
anymore
and
really
thiel
be
a
bottomless
pit
so
there
be
no
risk
that
the
company
wouldn
t
be
able
to
handle
whatever
be
thrown
its
way
for
eduardo
s
part
he
be
actually
glad
to
be
back
at
school
one
of
the
great
thrill
of
his
senior
year
have
be
the
first
week
he
d
heard
through
friend
at
the
phoenix
that
president
summer
have
announce
to
the
enter
freshman
that
he
have
checked
them
all
out
on
facebook
it
be
a
pretty
incredible
thought
that
the
president
of
harvard
be
use
their
site
to
get
to
know
the
incoming
class
just
ten
month
earlier
mark
and
eduardo
have
be
two
geeky
nobody
and
now
the
president
of
harvard
be
name
check
their
creation
in
light
of
that
do
any
of
the
squabble
between
him
and
mark
really
matter
when
mark
have
call
and
ask
him
to
come
out
to
california
to
sign
some
paper
basically
some
new
incorporation
stuff
for
the
new
restructure
of
the
company
now
that
thiel
be
on
board
eduardo
have
shrug
figure
it
be
all
for
the
best
so
as
one
of
the
lawyer
wander
across
the
central
office
and
hand
him
a
stack
of
legal
paper
he
take
a
deep
breath
glance
at
mark
again
then
start
reading
through
the
legalese
from
a
first
glance
it
be
pretty
complicate
stuff
four
document
in
all
number
many
page
altogether
first
there
be
two
common
stock
purchase
agreement
essentially
allow
him
to
buy
stock
in
the
newly
reincorporated
facebook
instead
of
the
now
worthless
stock
he
have
in
the
old
thefacebook
second
there
be
an
exchange
agreement
for
exchange
his
old
share
of
thefacebook
for
new
share
in
the
new
company
and
last
there
be
a
holder
voting
agreement
something
eduardo
didn
t
entirely
understand
but
seem
like
more
legalese
that
be
necessary
for
the
new
company
to
function
the
lawyer
do
their
best
to
explain
the
document
as
eduardo
leafed
through
them
after
the
repurchase
and
the
exchange
eduardo
would
have
a
total
of
share
of
the
new
company
accord
to
the
lawyer
and
mark
who
look
up
a
few
time
from
his
computer
to
help
outline
the
new
structure
eduardo
would
thus
have
about
percent
ownership
of
facebook
at
the
moment
the
rise
in
his
share
percentage
from
the
original
percent
due
to
the
necessity
in
the
future
of
dilution
as
they
hire
more
people
and
award
other
investor
that
would
surely
come
along
mark
s
own
percentage
have
go
down
to
about
percent
and
dustin
now
own
percent
of
the
company
sean
parker
have
be
give
percent
more
than
he
deserve
in
eduardo
s
mind
and
thiel
have
what
work
out
to
around
percent
include
in
the
document
be
a
vest
schedule
eduardo
wouldn
t
be
able
to
sell
his
share
anytime
soon
so
really
his
ownership
be
still
on
paper
like
mark
and
dustin
and
sean
he
assume
furthermore
there
be
also
include
a
general
release
of
any
claim
against
mark
and
the
company
basically
if
eduardo
sign
the
paper
he
d
be
say
that
these
new
paper
outline
his
position
at
facebook
in
its
entirety
that
everything
that
come
before
be
simply
history
sit
there
in
the
dormlike
house
listen
to
the
clack
of
dustin
and
mark
s
finger
against
the
computer
key
eduardo
read
through
the
paper
again
and
again
part
of
him
knew
that
these
paper
be
important
that
they
be
legal
document
that
signing
them
be
a
big
step
forward
for
the
company
but
he
felt
protect
first
because
the
lawyer
be
there
facebook
s
lawyer
which
meant
in
his
mind
that
they
be
his
lawyer
as
well
and
more
important
because
mark
his
friend
be
there
mark
be
tell
him
that
these
document
be
necessary
and
good
parker
be
somewhere
else
in
the
house
and
now
legally
he
d
be
part
of
the
team
for
good
but
he
have
brought
in
investor
money
and
he
be
one
of
the
smartest
people
in
silicon
valley
the
important
thing
be
eduardo
would
still
have
his
percentage
of
the
company
sure
there
would
be
dilution
but
wouldn
t
they
all
be
dilute
together
do
it
matter
that
it
be
no
longer
thefacebook
wouldn
t
he
be
in
the
same
position
with
facebook
he
thought
back
to
a
few
conversation
he
d
have
with
mark
recently
about
school
about
life
about
what
he
should
be
do
in
cambridge
while
mark
be
in
california
there
have
be
a
bit
of
a
miscommunication
in
eduardo
s
mind
at
some
point
mark
seem
to
be
tell
him
that
he
didn
t
need
to
work
that
hard
for
the
company
while
he
be
in
school
that
they
be
go
to
hire
salesperson
that
he
could
step
back
and
eduardo
for
his
part
have
maintain
that
he
still
have
the
time
to
do
what
be
necessary
for
facebook
well
these
paper
seem
to
say
in
eduardo
s
mind
that
he
be
just
as
big
a
part
of
the
company
as
he
d
ever
be
thing
might
change
a
bit
go
forward
as
more
money
come
in
as
more
people
be
hire
but
the
paper
be
just
a
necessary
restructuring
weren
t
they
in
any
event
mark
have
also
told
him
that
there
be
go
to
be
a
party
something
really
cool
when
the
site
reach
a
million
member
peter
thiel
be
go
to
throw
it
at
his
restaurant
in
san
francisco
and
eduardo
would
have
to
make
the
trip
back
out
because
it
be
go
to
be
well
worth
the
flight
think
about
that
party
eduardo
have
to
smile
just
a
necessary
restructuring
some
legal
paperwork
that
have
to
be
do
everything
be
go
to
work
out
just
fine
a
million
member
it
be
a
crazy
thought
he
d
definitely
come
back
out
to
california
for
that
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
reach
for
a
pen
from
one
of
the
lawyer
and
begin
signing
the
legal
document
after
all
now
he
own
percent
of
facebook
he
have
reason
to
celebrate
didn
t
he
eduardo
s
eye
burn
and
his
ear
rang
as
he
stumble
through
the
hip
and
pretty
crowd
his
head
spin
from
the
music
a
throb
mix
of
techno
alternative
and
rock
and
the
bright
multicolored
light
that
swirl
across
the
domed
ceiling
high
above
purple
yellow
orange
circular
pattern
twist
and
curve
like
galaxy
go
supernova
wash
the
entire
restaurant
in
a
truly
psychedelic
glow
the
place
be
call
frisson
and
it
be
currently
the
hottest
lounge
in
downtown
san
francisco
the
decor
be
somehow
exceedingly
modern
and
painfully
retro
at
the
same
time
land
somewhere
between
the
bridge
of
the
starship
enterprise
and
a
s
psychedelic
drug
trip
eduardo
s
head
be
really
spin
by
the
time
he
d
gotten
through
the
thick
of
the
crowd
partly
because
of
the
fairly
massive
amount
of
alcohol
he
d
already
consume
but
mostly
because
he
be
suffer
from
major
culture
shock
have
just
flown
in
once
again
from
the
staid
and
frozen
harvard
campus
he
pause
a
few
yard
from
the
dj
booth
that
be
plant
at
the
head
of
the
circular
din
area
and
survey
the
crowd
and
the
posh
restaurant
he
have
to
admit
the
restaurant
be
a
pretty
good
choice
for
facebook
s
millionth
member
party
the
shindig
mark
have
invite
him
to
set
up
to

time

d
launch
the
thing
in
mark
s
kirkland
dorm
room

modern
hip
and
exclusive

like

by
peter

who
be

for
the
party

of
his
own
deep
pocket
eduardo
watch
the
young
northern
california
crowd
bounce
to
the
music
it
be
almost
an
even
mix
of
jean
and
collar
shirt
and
sleek
black
european
style
dud
overall
the
party
be
very
silicon
valley
very
hip
san
francisco
and
it
be
also
very
facebook
much
of
the
room
be
college
age
or
close
to
it
lot
of
stanford
kid
and
fresh
graduate
everyone
be
drinking
colorful
mixed
drink
and
everyone
seem
to
be
have
a
good
time
eduardo
couldn
t
help
notice
the
group
of
cute
girl
on
the
other
side
of
the
dj
booth
one
of
them
seem
to
smile
at
him
and
he
blush
quickly
look
away
yeah
he
be
still
pretty
shy
despite
everything
that
have
change
in
his
life
the
party
have
be
go
pretty
well
for
him
too
since
he
d
walk
through
the
door
he
d
be
tell
everyone
who
would
listen
that
he
have
cofounded
facebook
along
with
mark
and
dustin
sometimes
the
girl
smile
and
sometimes
they
just
look
at
him
like
he
be
crazy
it
be
a
little
strange
at
harvard
everyone
kind
of
knew
him
what
he
have
do
here
they
be
all
look
at
mark
and
only
mark
but
that
be
okay
really
eduardo
didn
t
mind
be
in
the
background
here
in
california
he
hadn
t
gotten
into
this
for
the
fame
he
didn
t
really
care
if
people
knew
he
have
be
there
in
that
dorm
room
that
he
own
more
than
percent
of
the
company
that
he
be
the
person
most
responsible
for
those
million
member
other
than
mark
he
only
care
that
these
people
love
the
site
and
that
it
be
turn
into
one
of
the
big
business
in
internet
history
he
grin
sloppily
at
the
thought
then
shift
his
eye
past
the
dance
floor
to
the
lounge
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
restaurant
toward
the
back
of
the
room
seat
around
a
circular
table
he
could
barely
make
out
mark
and
sean
and
peter
sit
together
deep
in
conversation
he
knew
that
coincidentally
it
happen
to
be
sean
s
birthday
how
old
be
the
kid
now
twenty
five
he
consider
head
over
to
them
but
at
the
moment
he
felt
a
bit
more
comfortable
lose
in
the
crowd
anonymous
alone
the
culture
shock
again
this
place
felt
so
far
from
harvard
yard
that
he
might
as
well
have
be
on
the
starship
enterprise
he
blink
let
the
swirl
of
light
wash
through
him

first
short
skirt
of
the
season
it
s
all
downhill
from
here
eduardo
didn
t
think
he
d
ever
get
use
to
how
long
winter
seem
to
last
at
harvard
just
a
week
ago
the
yard
be
white
with
snow
these
very
step
cover
in
sheet
of
ice
the
air
so
sharp
and
cold
it
hurt
to
take
a
breath
it
have
seem
like
march
didn
t
even
have
a
spot
on
the
harvard
calendar
it
be
just
february
february
and
more
goddamn
february
but
finally
finally
the
snow
be
go
the
air
smell
alive
the
sky
be
bright
and
blue
and
pretty
much
cloudless
and
the
girl
have
start
to
rearrange
their
closet
put
the
thick
ugly
sweater
away
and
reach
for
the
skirt
the
cute
little
top
the
open
toed
shoe
well
maybe
the
top
weren
t
all
that
cute
it
be
harvard
after
all
but
the
skin
be
show
and
that
be
a
damn
good
thing
of
course
it
could
change
on
a
dime
tomorrow
those
gray
cloud
could
roll
back
in
and
the
yard
could
turn
back
into
an
inhospitable
lunar
landscape
but
then
again
tomorrow
eduardo
wouldn
t
be
in
new
england
he
d
be
back
in
california
once
more
because
he
d
be
summon
from
on
high
aj
give
him
a
wave
then
head
down
the
stone
step
on
his
way
to
a
seminar
on
the
other
side
of
the
yard
eduardo
would
follow
in
a
few
minute
but
he
wasn
t
in
any
rush
they
be
senior
barely
two
month
from
graduation
they
could
be
late
to
class
hell
they
could
skip
class
entirely
it
wouldn
t
make
any
difference
as
long
as
they
pass
the
few
exam
they
have
left
they
be
pretty
much
on
their
way
out
of
harvard
with
those
golden
diploma
that
supposedly
meant
so
much
in
the
real
world
the
real
world
eduardo
wasn
t
even
sure
what
that
term
meant
anymore
it
certainly
wasn
t
california
where
mark
be
still
hole
up
in
yet
another
sublet
in
another
leafy
suburban
town
furiously
building
facebook
ten
thousand
user
at
a
time
and
it
wasn
t
the
new
facebook
office
in
palo
alto
that
mark
have
told
him
about
the
one
they
be
put
the
finish
touch
on
before
the
upcoming
round
of
new
hire
the
growth
they
d
talk
about
back
in
the
fall
when
they
d
sign
all
the
paper
for
the
company
restructure
the
real
world
couldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
facebook
because
the
real
world
simply
didn
t
move
that
fast
one
million
member
have
suddenly
become
two
on
its
way
to
three
and
the
little
harvard
base
web
site
be
now
simply
everywhere
on
five
hundred
campus
in
every
newspaper
eduardo
saw
at
the
newsstand
on
every
news
show
he
happen
to
catch
before
or
after
class
everyone
he
knew
be
on
facebook
even
his
dad
have
log
on
use
his
account
and
have
love
what
he
d
see
facebook
wasn
t
the
real
world
it
be
way
big
than
that
it
be
a
whole
new
universe
and
eduardo
couldn
t
help
but
be
proud
of
what
he
and
mark
have
do
even
though
over
the
past
two
month
he
d
have
almost
no
significant
interaction
with
the
guy
out
in
california
other
than
the
odd
phone
call
the
odd
request
for
a
contact
from
new
york
or
a
name
from
his
research
into
potential
advertiser
in
fact
eduardo
have
be
so
distant
from
mark
over
the
past
couple
of
month
eduardo
d
have
time
to
launch
a
whole
separate
web
site
something
call
joboozle
that
aim
to
be
a
sort
of
facebook
for
job
where
kid
could
go
to
search
out
potential
employer
share
r
sum
s
network
eduardo
didn
t
have
any
expectation
that
joboozle
would
ever
be
anything
close
to
facebook
but
it
certainly
have
pass
the
time
while
he
wait
for
mark
to
get
back
in
touch
and
finally
mark
have
gotten
back
in
touch
an
e
mail
just
a
couple
day
ago
ask
him
to
make
the
trip
back
out
to
cali
something
about
an
important
business
meeting
and
a
new
hire
that
eduardo
be
suppose
to
help
train
in
the
e
mail
mark
have
also
mention
something
that
have
cause
eduardo
a
little
bit
of
concern
recently
some
big
name
venture
capital
fund
have
be
circle
the
company
sequoia
capital
the
big
fund
in
silicon
valley
run
by
sean
parker
s
old
nemesis
michael
moritz
and
accel
partner
a
very
prestigious
palo
alto
fund
that
have
be
active
in
the
space
over
the
past
decade
and
mark
have
intimate
in
the
e
mail
that
there
be
a
chance
they
d
let
one
of
the
fund
invest
mark
have
also
mention
that
don
graham
the
ceo
of
the
washington
post
company
be
interested
as
well
furthermore
mark
have
note
he
and
sean
parker
and
dustin
be
think
about
sell
a
little
of
their
own
stock
if
a
deal
go
through
two
million
dollar
apiece
be
the
figure
he
give
in
the
e
mail
eduardo
have
be
more
than
a
little
surprised
by
that
first
from
the
paper
he
d
sign
he
be
pretty
certain
that
he
didn
t
have
the
ability
to
sell
stock
his
share
didn
t
vest
for
a
long
long
time
so
why
be
mark
sean
and
dustin
able
to
cash
out
two
million
dollar
worth
hadn
t
they
sign
the
same
paper
as
he
have
during
the
restructure
and
second
why
be
mark
talk
about
sell
share
at
all
since
when
do
mark
care
about
money
and
why
do
sean
parker
get
to
make
two
million
buck
when
he
d
be
a
part
of
the
company
officially
for
about
ten
week
eduardo
have
be
there
since
the
begin
it
certainly
didn
t
seem
fair
maybe
eduardo
be
simply
misunderstand
the
situation
maybe
mark
would
clear
thing
up
when
eduardo
met
with
him
in
california
in
any
event
eduardo
have
decide
he
wasn
t
go
to
let
his
emotion
take
over
this
time
since
his
anger
hadn
t
exactly
help
the
situation
back
during
the
summer
he
be
go
to
be
calm
rational
and
understand
it
be
spring
the
skirt
be
out
and
school
be
almost
over
tomorrow
eduardo
would
make
the
six
hour
trip
check
out
the
new
office
that
be
under
construction
attend
that
business
meeting
and
train
that
new
hire
whoever
he
be
hopefully
it
would
be
the
begin
of
thing
go
back
to
normal
between
him
and
mark
so
that
when
he
graduate
he
could
go
right
back
to
his
old
role
as
mark
s
found
partner
the
idea
be
pretty
please
to
him
because
in
a
way
it
meant
he
could
extend
his
college
life
even
far
because
as
big
a
company
as
facebook
become
eduardo
be
pretty
sure
it
would
always
feel
like
college
to
him
at
facebook
he
could
keep
on
postpone
the
real
world
just
like
mark
be
do
maybe
forever
eduardo
be
warm
by
that
thought
as
he
start
down
the
library
step
toward
the
yard
tomorrow
he
d
be
back
with
mark
and
mark
would
explain
everything
eduardo
would
remember
the
moment
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
start
to
shake
as
he
stood
there
in
the
mostly
bare
office
star
down
at
the
paper
that
the
lawyer
have
hand
him
the
minute
he
d
walk
through
the
door
it
be
a
different
lawyer
this
time
and
it
be
a
different
door
not
the
dormlike
sublet
in
a
leafy
suburb
but
a
real
office
on
university
avenue
in
downtown
palo
alto
with
glass
wall
maple
cover
desk
new
computer
monitor
carpeting
even
a
staircase
cover
in
graffiti
by
a
local
artist
who
d
be
commission
for
the
task
a
real
office
and
another
real
lawyer
stand
between
eduardo
and
mark
who
be
somewhere
inside
at
one
of
the
computer
where
he
always
seem
to
be
safe
in
the
glow
of
that
goddamn
screen
at
first
eduardo
have
thought
the
guy
be
joking
greet
him
with
more
contract
to
sign
even
before
he
d
have
a
chance
to
check
out
the
place
or
ask
mark
about
the
new
hire
the
two
million
dollar
stock
sale
the
e
mail
but
as
eduardo
start
to
read
the
legalese
he
d
realize
that
this
trip
to
california
wasn
t
about
a
business
meeting
this
be
an
ambush
it
take
eduardo
a
few
minute
to
understand
what
he
be
reading
but
as
he
do
his
cheek
turn
white
his
skin
go
cold
then
full
realization
hit
him
like
a

of

up
the
library
s
great
greek
pillar
up
into
the
aquamarine
sky
it
have
be
a
long
morning
already
but
eduardo
be
fill
with
energy
and
he
could
tell
that
his
fellow
senior
felt
equally
alive
fidget
anxiously
against
the
little
wooden
seat
the
day
have
begin
early
with
the
march
from
the
river
house
the
long
line
of
senior
garbed
in
black
gown
traipse
through
harvard
square
and
down
into
the
yard
although
it
be
hot
outside
eduardo
have
his
jacket
and
tie
on
under
the
gown
after
the
ceremony
he
be
go
to
spend
most
of
the
afternoon
with
his
family
he
wasn
t
quite
sure
where
they
be
in
the
gather
audience
that
stretch
out
behind
where
the
senior
be
sit
but
he
knew
they
be
there
in
truth
the
entire
yard
be
packed
with
people
more
people
than
eduardo
have
ever
see
in
one
place
outside
of
the
odd
rock
concert
he
d
go
to
in
high
school
and
they
d
be
there
all
day
later
that
afternoon
john
lithgow
the
actor
and
harvard
grad
would
be
speak
before
that
the
graduate
senior
would
gather
on
the
step
of
widener
for
a
class
photo
they
d
go
to
a
picnic
with
their
family
and
then
they
d
say
good
bye
to
one
another
and
to
the
school
maybe
some
of
them
would
throw
their
square
hat
into
the
air
because
they
d
see
the
clich
d
act
on
television
and
well
the
hat
be
pretty
stupid
anyway
eduardo
turn
his
attention
back
to
the
stage
he
be
immediately
impressed
by
all
the
color
the
stark
contrast
to
the
sea
of
black
that
surround
him
the
university
marshal
the
tenure
professor
the
honor
alum
they
be
all
present
now
line
up
behind
the
president
in
their
bright
nearly
psychedelic
gown
eduardo
s
gaze
slid
back
to
that
bin
of
diploma
he
knew
that
somewhere
in
that
mountain
of
roll
paper
sat
a
diploma
with
his
name
on
it
a
curl
latin
emboss
page
that
have
cost
his
parent
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
dollar
in
some
way
that
diploma
have
cost
eduardo
much
much
more
ten
thousand
men
of
harvard
the
melody
be
come
somewhere
from
eduardo
s
left
he
couldn
t
believe
that
someone
actually
knew
the
word
to
the
old
college
fight
song
well
some
of
them
anyway
whoever
it
be
the
guy
be
hum
his
way
through
most
of
the
tune
eduardo
do
actually
know
the
word
because
he
d
learn
them
his
freshman
year
after
the
march
band
have
sung
the
song
during
the
harvard
yale
game
he
d
be
pretty
gung
ho
crimson
at
the
time
so
proud
that
he
be
a
part
of
this
history
this
university
so
proud
because
his
father
be
so
proud
because
all
the
hard
work
of
high
school
have
paid
off
the
difficult
road
learn
a
new
language
fitting
into
a
new
culture
have
lead
to
this
place
this
beautiful
yard
embrace
by
these
historic
building
he
have
learn
the
song
because
this
be
his
moment
as
much
as
it
belong
to
anyone
who
d
ever
stood
shoulder
to

in
this
place
he

it
every
second
of
it
ten

he
turn
his
attention
back
to
the
stage
summer
be
almost
ready
behind
the
lectern
his
wide
jowly
face
just
inch
from
the
microphone
eduardo
knew
it
would
take
them
a
while
to
get
to
his
name
and
when
they
do
he
also
knew
that
the
president
would
probably
mispronounce
it
leave
the
o
off
the
first
part
or
lean
heavily
on
the
second
syllable
of
the
last
he
be
use
to
that
and
he
didn
t
care
he
be
go
to
march
up
there
and
get
that
diploma
because
he
deserve
it
that
be
how
the
world
be
suppose
to
work
that
be
fair
just
as
the
microphone
burst
to
life
and
the
first
name
be
read
a
flash
go
off
from
somewhere
behind
eduardo
a
high
power
camera
catch
the
first
senior
on
his
way
to
the
stage
eduardo
couldn
t
help
wonder
if
that
picture
would
one
day
find
its
way
onto
someone
s
facebook
profile
he
be
pretty
certain
that
sooner
or
later
it
would
for
the
first
time
that
day
his
smile
almost
disappear
two
a
m
eighteen
long
hour
later
hand
jammed
deep
into
the
pocket
of
his
blazer

swim
from
a
day
of
family
scorch
temperature
and
a
quarter
bottle
of
expensive
scotch
eduardo
sank
deep
into
a
leather
couch
on
the
third
floor
of
the
phoenix
watch
a
group
of
blond
girl
he
didn
t
know
dance
around
a
coffee
table
pile
so
high
with
alcohol
bottle
it
look
like
a
little
glass
metropolis
sparkle
brightly
on
a
moonlit
night
downstairs
the
party
be
in
full

from

from
the
dance
floor
on
the
first
floor
a
mix
of
hip
hop
and
top
eduardo
could
picture
the
surge
crowd
of
kid
trample
the
hardwood
floor
inhale
the
smoke
from
the
bonfire
outside
kick
up
the
dander
of
two
hundred
year
of
history
as
they
buck
and
spun
to
the
beat
he
could
picture
all
the
pretty
girl
many
of
them
still
fresh
from
the
fuck
truck
and
all
the
eager
young
phoenix
member
search
for
that
special
connection
that
night
to
remember
that
frozen
moment
in
time
but
up
here
on
the
third
floor

be
quieter
aside
from
the

place

the
feel
of
a
posh
vip
room
and

d
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
this
room

contemplate
planning
out
his
future
college
be
over
now
and
eduardo
be
head
out
of
the
safe
confines
of
the
yard
he
wasn

sure
where
yet
maybe
boston
maybe
new
york
but
he
do
know
that
he
wasn
t
a
kid
anymore
he
didn
t
feel
like
a
kid
anymore
for
one
thing
he
d
already
begin
the
legal
process
of
go
after
what
he
felt
be
fairly
his
he
d
hire

the
rest
of

he
intend
to
sue
he
hat
the
idea
of
a
courtroom
of
go
up
against
his
friend
in
front
of
a
judge
or
a

but
he
knew
that
there
be
no
other
way
it
wasn
t
just
mark
and
him
anymore
sit
there
on
the

he
wonder
if
mark

any
regret
at
all
at
how
thing
have
turn
out
probably
not
he
realize
with
a
grimace
mark
probably
didn
t
even
think
that
he
d
do
anything
wrong
from
mark
s
point
of
view
he
have
only
do
what
be
necessary
for
the
business
facebook
have
be
mark
s
idea
in
the
begin
after
all
he
be
the
one
who
d
put
in
the
hour
put
in
the

the
site
go
to
california
postpone
college
found
the
funding
to
him
it
have
be
a
mark
zuckerberg
production
from
day
one
and
everyone
else
be
just
try
to
hang
on
the
winklevosses
eduardo
maybe
even
sean
parker
in
fact
from
mark
s
point
of
view
it
be
probably
eduardo
who
have
act
inappropriately
who
have
betrayed
their
friendship
from
mark
s
point
of
view
eduardo
have
try
to
hurt
the
company
by
freeze
the
bank
account
from
mark
s
point
of
view
eduardo
have
try
to
make
it
difficult
to
raise
vc
money
by
assert
his
own
position
as
the
titular
head
of
business
from
mark
s
point
of
view
eduardo
have
even
do
some
other
thing
that
could
have
cause
facebook
harm
such
as
start
a
separate
web
site
joboozle
and
approach
the
same
potential
advertising
base
with
what
mark
might
have
see
as
facebook
s
trade
secret
mark
have
as
much
reason
to
see
himself
as
the
wrong
party
as
eduardo
do
but
eduardo
didn
t
see
it
that
way
he
believe
fully
and
completely
that
he
have
be
there
from
the
begin
that
he
have
be
integral
to
facebook
s
success
he
have
put
up
the
initial
money
he
have
put
in
his
time
and
he
deserve
what
they
have
agree
upon
pure
and
simple
he
do
agree
with
mark
about
one
thing
it
wasn
t
about
friendship
anymore
it
be
business
simply
business
eduardo
would
pursue
what
he
believe
he
deserve
he
d
take
mark
to
court
make
him
explain
himself
make
him
do
what
be
fair
as
he
watch
the
girl
gyrate
to
the
music
their
blond
hair
flow
and
twist
above
them
in
a
swirl
golden
storm
he
wonder
if
mark
even
remember
how
it
have
all
start
how
they
have
be
two
geeky
kid
try
to
do
something
special
try
to
get
notice
really
try
to
get
laid
he
wonder
if
mark
realize
how
much
thing
have
change
or
maybe
mark
have
never
really
change
at
all
maybe
eduardo
have
just
misread
him
from
the
start
like
the
winklevoss
twin
eduardo
have
project
his
own
thought
onto
that
blankness
draw
in
the
feature
he
most
want
to
see
maybe
he
d
never
really
know
mark
zuckerberg
he
wonder
if
deep
down
mark
zuckerberg
even
knew
himself
and
sean
parker
sean
parker
probably
thought
he
knew
mark
zuckerberg
too
but
eduardo
be
pretty
sure
that
be
go
to
be
a
short
live
pair
as
well
in
eduardo
s
mind
sean
parker
be
like
a
jittery
little
comet
tear
through
the
atmosphere
he
d
already
burn
through
two
startup
the
question
wasn
t
if
he
d
burn
through
facebook
as
well
it
be
when
the
strange
thing
be
nobody
even
heard
the
siren
one
minute
everything
be
go
along
great
the
party
be
really
rock
the
suburban
house
fill
with
good
look
happy
people
college
girl
and
grad
student
guy
urban
hipster
and
stylish
twentysomethings
kid
with
backpack
and
baseball
hat
mingle
with
professional
in
tight
fitting
jean
and
collar
shirt
the
place
felt
like
an
extension
of
any
cosmopolitan
nightclub
scene
but
in
a
manageable
collegiate
set
kind
of
like
a
frat
party
for
kid
who
didn
t
know
the
first
thing
about
frat
the
booze
be
flow
the
music
pound
through
the
wood
floor
and
reverberate
off
the
bare
plaster
wall
and
then
blam
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
it
all
go
bad
there
be
a
scream
and
then
the
front
door
crashed
open
flashlight
tore
across
the
dark
crowd
dance
floor
dart
and
dive
along
the
plaster
wall
like
ufo
assault
a
barren
plain
and
then
they
come
pour
in
like
so
many
fuck
gestapo
bullyboy
shout
and
barking
and
shove
wield
those
flashlight
like
goddamn
light
saber
dark
blue
uniform
drawn
nightstick
and
badge
and
even
a
few
handcuff
no
gun
that
anyone
could
see
but
the
holster
be
clearly
visible
the
cruel
twist
of
metal
bulge
through
the
thick
dark
rubber
sleeve
siren
or
no
this
party
be
over
one
can
imagine
that
sean
parker
s
first
thought
be
that
someone
have
make
a
mistake
this
be
just
a
goddamn
party
right
outside
a
college
campus
it
be
totally
innocuous
he
d
go
there
with
one
of
facebook
s
many
undergraduate
employee
a
pretty
girl
whom
he
d
befriend
pure
innocent
fun
just
a
party
the
kind
of
thing
he
d
be
to
a
thousand

about

maybe
just
maybe
this
wasn

as
simple
as
a

he

facebook
wasn

sean
have
see
to
that
himself
it
be
now
a
major
corporation
on
its
way
to
a
billion
dollar
valuation
and
he
and

they
weren
t
two
kid
play
around
with
a
computer
program
they
be
executive
run
a
company
a
company
that
neither
one
of
them
want
to
sell
a
company
that
both
of
them
now
believe
would
one
day
be
worth
much
much
more
than
a
billion
dollar
the
growth
that
have
go
on
over
the
past
few
month
be
nothing
less
than
spectacular
in
sean
s
view
what
be
go
on
with
facebook
be
truly
transformative
the
culmination
of
a
few
brilliant
idea
played
out
across
an
exceedingly
successful
network
of
eager
participant
the
first
and
most
recent
transformative
development
have
to
be
the
picture
share
application
the
idea
that
facebook
be
now
a
place
where
you
share
and
view
picture
that
coincide
with
your
social
life
it
be
the
true
digitalization
of
real
life
you
didn
t
just
go
to
a
party
anymore
you
go
to
a
party
with
your
digital
camera
so
you
and
your
friend
could
relive
that
party
the
next
day
or
at
two
in
the
morning
via
facebook
and
the
tag
the
idea
that
you
could
tag
anyone
you
want
in
those
picture
so
that
those
people
could
find
themselves
see
who
be
there
literally
see
your
social
network
in
its
digital
form
it
be
utter
genius
and
it
have
lead
to
an
explosion
of
user
now
maybe
eight
million
ten
million
god
facebook
be
grow
so
fast
and
they
weren
t
even
close
to
finish
the
next
transformative
step
on
par
with
picture
would
be
the
newsfeed
an
idea
that
sean
and
mark
have
be
think
about
independently
the
newsfeed
would
be
a
constant
update
of
information
among
people
in
a
social
network
which
would
link
people
even
more
through
their
facebook
page
a
living
digital
log
of
every
change
in
a
person
s
profile
broadcast
to
all
his
friend
instantaneously
when
complete
it
would
be
a
sophisticated
feat
of
computer
engineering
that
dustin
and
mark
would
have
to
pull
off
exponentially
complex
a
sort
of
broadcast
channel
limited
to
group
of
friend
that
have
to
be
constantly
update
moment
by
moment
for
sean
the
idea
have
come
about
after
hour
spent
watch
what
people
do
when
they
log
into
facebook
how
they
always
checked
their
friend
status
update
checked
to
see
which
friend
have
change
their
profile
their
photo
the
idea
of
a
newsfeed
be
one
of
those
eureka
moment
if
there
be
a
way
this
could
happen
automatically
sean
have
realize
it
would
enhance
the
facebook
experience
the
same
way
photo
and
tag
have
these
be
more
than
just
application
they
be
milestone
in
the
make
change
what
begin
as
a
dorm
room
idea
into
a
life
change
billion
dollar
company
building
the
big
most
successful
picture
share
site
on
the
web
on
top
of
the
most
successful
social
network
add
an
innovation
like
a
newsfeed
on
top
of
that
facebook
be
go
to
be
big
than
anything
else
on
the
web
sean
be
sure
of
it
someday
soon
they
d
open
it
up
to
the
general
public
the
next
great
transformative
step
the
next
milestone
and
then
they
d
go
international
and
after
that
well
nothing
would
ever
come
close
to
facebook
again
sean
wasn
t
think
friendster
or
even
myspace
he
be
think
google
and
microsoft
facebook
would
be
that
big
and
when
thing
get
big
well
sean
parker
knew
well
than
anyone
else
what
often
happen
people
begin
to
act
differently
friendship
fell
apart
problem
arose
sometimes
seemingly
out
of
nowhere
maybe
just
maybe
as
facebook
get
big
than
big
as
the
money
pour
in
and
the
vcs
start
to
think
in
term
of
billion
maybe
there
be
people
who
didn
t
feel
they
need
a
sean
parker
involve
anymore
it
have
happen
before
twice
could
it
really
be
happen
again
or
be
he
just
be
paranoid
maybe
thing
be
exactly
as
they
seem
a
party
that
be
be
bust
and
him
right
there
in
the
middle
of
it
all
bad
luck
bad
timing
sean
s
next
thought
as
he
be
arrest
be
that
he
have
to
make
a
phone
call
speculation
be
a
beast
that
could
cause
a
lot
more
damage
than
a
nightstick
or
a
pair
of
handcuff
innocent
or
not
it
didn
t
exactly
look
good
for
the
president
of
a
transformative
world
change
billion
dollar
company
to
get
bust
with
an
undergraduate
employee
at
a
house
party
he
didn
t
think
he
be
go
to
end
up
in
jail
but
he
be
certain
of
one
thing
innocent
or
not
setup
or
pure
bad
luck
mark
zuckerberg
be
go
to
be
pretty
piss
off
at
some
point
that
night
or
maybe
even
the
next
day
mark
zuckerberg
likely
receive
a
phone
call
maybe
from
the
corporate
lawyer
maybe
from
sean
himself
the
odds
be
good
that
mark
be
at
the
facebook
office
at
the
time
because
he
be
almost
always
at
those
office
we
can
picture
him
there
alone
his
face
lit
by
the
greenish
blue
glow
of
the
computer
screen
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
maybe
it
be
still
the
middle
of
the
night
or
maybe
early
morning
time
have
never
be
a
very
useful
concept
to
mark
just
twitch
in
a
clock
that
have
no
real
world
purpose
no
claim
or
innate
value
information
be
so
much
more
important
and
the
information
mark
have
just
receive
certainly
have
to
be
dealt
with
quickly
and
with
utter
efficiency
sean
parker
be
a
genius
and
he
d
be
instrumental
in
get
facebook
to
where
it
be
now
sean
parker
be
one
of
mark
s
hero
and
would
always
be
a
mentor
an
adviser
and
maybe
even
a
friend
but
we
can
imagine
what
mark
must
have
thought
after
hearing
the
detail
of
the
house
party
that
have
just
be
bust
by
the
cop
sean
parker
have
to
go
whatever
the
reason
even
though
sean
wasn
t
go
to
be
try
or
indict
for
anything
that
he
d
do
in
some
people
s
eye
the
current
situation
would
make
sean
a
danger
to
facebook
to
his
detractor
he
have
always
be
unpredictable
wild
people
didn
t
always
understand
him
and
some
found
his
energy
level
terrify
but
this
be
different
this
be
black
and
white
no
matter
why
it
have
happen
whether
it
be
bad
luck
or
something
else
the
result
be
as
clear
as
data
in
data
out
sean
parker
have
to
go
like
eduardo
like
the
winklevosses
anything
that
become
a
threat
no
matter
the
intention
have
to
be
dealt
with
because
in
the
end
the
only
thing
that
matter
be
facebook
it
be
mark
zuckerberg
s
creation
his
baby
and
it
have
become
the
focus
of
his
life
in
the
begin
maybe
it
have
simply
be
something
fun
something
interest
another
game
a
toy
like
the
version
of
risk
he
d
built
in
high
school
or
facemash
the
stunt
that
have
nearly
gotten
him
kick
out
of
harvard
but
now
we
can
surmise
facebook
be
an
extension
of
the
only
true
love
of
mark
s
world
the
computer
that
glow
screen
in
front
of
his
face
and
like
the
personal
computer
that
mark
s
idol
bill
gate
have
unleashed
on
humanity
by
mean
of
his
groundbreaking
software
facebook
really
be
a
revolution
world
change
create
a
free
exchange
of
information
across
social
network
that
would
digitize
the
world
in
a
way
nothing
else
could
mark
wouldn
t
let
anything
or
anyone
stand
in
the
way
of
facebook
what
mark
zuckerberg
have
become
could
best
be
illustrate
by
the
business
card
simple
and
elegant
with
a
single
sentence
print
across
the
center
that
he
create
most
likely
sit
at
his
computer
the
screen
glow
across
his
face
the
business
card
that
he
would
have
print
out
to
carry
with
him
everywhere
in
one
sense
the
card
represent
nothing
more
than
mark
zuckerberg
s
personal
brand
of
humor
but
in
another
sense
the
card
be
more
than
a
joke
because
it
be
true
no
matter
what
else
anyone
want
to
believe
no
matter
what
anyone
else
ever
try
to
do
the
sentiment
of
the
card
would
always
be
true
inevitably
indelibly
true
we
can
picture
mark
reading
the
word
on
the
card
aloud
to
himself
the
small
hint
of
a
grin
twitch
across
his
usually
impassive
face
i
m
ceo
bitch
shit
it
be
go
to
be
one
of
those
night
eduardo
wasn
t
exactly
sure
what
the
name
of
the
club
be
or
even
how
exactly
he
d
gotten
there
he
knew
it
be
new
york
and
he
be
in
the
meat
pack
district
he
knew
there
have
be
a
cab
involve
and
at
least
two
friend
from
college
and
somewhere
along
the
line
there
have
be
a
girl
christ
there
always
seem
to
be
a
girl
involve
didn
t
there
and
he
be
pretty
sure
she
be
hot
possibly
asian
and
she
might
even
have
kiss
him
but
somewhere
between
the
cab
and
the
club
she
d
disappear
and
now
he
be
alone
sprawl
out
on
a
bright
blue
leather
banquette
star
at
his
own
reflection
in
a
scotch
glass
see
his
own
face
melt
down
the
curve
slope
of
the
ice
inside
like
an
image
from
a
funhouse
mirror
or
maybe
one
of
those
salvador
dal
painting
the
one
they
d
talk
about
in
that
core
class
spot
and
dot
he
thought
they
call
it
modern
art
for
kid
who
didn
t
really
give
a
shit
about
modern
art
he
be
alone
and
he
be
drunk
but
really
not
that
drunk
it
be
a
combination
of
thing
that
be
blurring
his
vision
and
the
alcohol
be
not
even
that
high
on
the
list
first
there
be
the
lack
of
sleep
it
have
be
about
three
week
since
he
d
gotten
to
bed
before
four
with
the
new
start
up
he
d
be
work
on
involve
health
care
social
network
and
everything
in
between
and
the
lawsuit
that
dominate
many
of
his
day
and
of
course
his
social
life
spread
out
between
boston
and
new
york
and
sometimes
california
and
the
phoenix
always
the
phoenix
nobody
care
that
he
be
a
little
bit
old
than
everyone
else
at
the
club
because
they
be
still
brother
they
would
always
be
brother
and
everyone
at
the
phoenix
still
knew
exactly
who
he
be
what
he
d
do
even
if
the
rest
of
the
world
have
never
heard
of
him
even
if
the
rest
of
the
world
only
equate
facebook
with
one
name
one
kid
genius
yeah
eduardo
be
tire
he
hadn
t
really
slept
in
week
he
lean
back
against
the
banquette
star
into
that
scotch
glass
when
a
sudden
memory
flash
across
his
thought
a
memory
from
a
night
just
like
this
one
another
moment
when
he
hadn
t
kept
his
mouth
shut
a
moment
from
that
summer
he
d
spent
in
new
york
way
back
in
eduardo
wasn
t
sure
exactly
of
the
day
and
month
but
it
have
be
sometime
after
he
d
frozen
that
bank
account
sometime
after
those
phone
call
between
him
and
mark
that
have
in
retrospect
be
the
begin
of
the
end
the
crack
that
eventually
turn
into
compound
fracture
eduardo
have
be
angry
and
he
d
be
hurt
and
he
d
go
out
drinking
just
like
tonight
and
have
end
up
in
a
club
just
like
this
one
that
night
he
d
be
on
the
dance
floor
chase
after
some
girl
when
he
d
glance
across
the
club
and
have
notice
someone
stand
at
the
edge
of
the
room
look
in
his
direction
eduardo
have
recognize
the
kid
immediately
because
well
he
have
be
hard
to
miss
big
muscular
an
athlete
with
a
movie
star
face
and
an
olympic
physique
eduardo
have
see
him
many
time
around
campus
with
his
identical
twin
brother
in
fact
eduardo
wasn
t
even
sure
which
of
the
winklevoss
twin
he
be
look
at
just
that
it
be
one
of
them
right
in
front
of
him
barely
ten
foot
away
in
some
nameless
new
york
club
right
there
and
then
eduardo
have
let
the
emotion
and
the
alcohol
get
the
well
of
him
maybe
deep
down
he
d
have
a
premonition
about
what
be
go
to
happen
between
him
and
mark
or
maybe
he
have
just
be
drunk
whatever
the
reason
he
d
walk
right
up
to
the
winklevoss
twin
and
have
held
out
his
hand
as
the
stun
kid
have
star
at
him
eduardo
have
let
the
word
come
spill
out
i
m
sorry
he
screw
me
like
he
screw
you
guy
and
without
another
word
he
have
turn
and
disappear
back
onto
the
dance
floor

scale
political
activism
over

tyler

since
the
end
of
tyler

winklevoss
have
doggedly
pursue
their
legal
case
against
mark
zuckerberg
and
facebook
finally
result
in
a
settlement
late
last
summer
although
the
detail
of
the

be
seal
by
order
of
the

in

in
the
vicinity
of
sixty
five
million
dollar
though
the
sum
seem
significant
there
be
much
evidence
that
tyler
and
cameron
be
not
happy
with
the
result
of
the
settlement
and
it
s
likely
that
their
battle
with
mark
and
facebook
be
far
from
over
on
a
brighter
note
tyler

the

of
his
lawsuit
against

and
that
brought
by

against

however
in
january
of
this

eduardo

abruptly
reinstate
into

this

only
be

as
evidence
that

found
some
success
in

their

remains
to
be
see
facebook
and
mark
zuckerberg
as
for
facebook
itself
in
october
of
after
a
brief
and
highly
public
bidding

valuate

at
over
billion
or
more
than
one
hundred
time
its
million
dollar
in
annual
revenue
since
then
like
the
economy
itself
facebook
have
deflate
somewhat
in
term
of
overall
valuation
while
its

have
continued
to
increase
but
whatever
the
true
multiple
might
be
facebook
have
continued
its
almost
startle
pattern
of
growth
by
the
end
of
this
