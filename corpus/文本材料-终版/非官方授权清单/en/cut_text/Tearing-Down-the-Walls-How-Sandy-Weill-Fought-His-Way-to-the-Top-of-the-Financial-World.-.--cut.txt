despite
their

sandy
and
carter
never
stop
talk
about
how
they
would
run
a
business
as
dawn
the
two
men
could
do
more
than
talk
they
be
experienced
they
be
earn
good
salary
they
have
move
their
family
into
big
suburban
home
in
affluent

although
sandy

joan
rent
rather
than
own
their
home
where
jew
be
welcome
and
they
have
some
money
in
the
bank
the
idea
of
start
their
own
firm
be
immensely
appeal
if
they
own
the
firm
they
could
keep
all
the
fee
and
commission
they
generate
but
it
be
also
frighten
sandy
s
brokerage
business
would
generate
immediate
commission
if
as
he
presume
his
client
follow
him
to
the
new
firm
it
be
much
less
likely
that
the
company
carter
advise
at
his
investment
banking
firm
would
follow
him
to
a
small
new
outfit
there
be
no
way
to
know
how
long
it
might
take
for
carter
to
begin
generate
fee
one
solution
carter
suggest
would
be
to
bring
in
another
broker
who
like
sandy
could
begin
generate
commission
immediately
and
he
have
just
the
person
in
mind
an
old
friend
name
roger
berlind
a
princeton
english
major
work
at
eastman
dillon
like
sandy
roger
berlind
be
jewish
and
have
endure
the
same
humiliation
try
to
break
into
wall
street
thirty
consecutive
rejection
before
eastman
dillon
hire
him
and
it
wasn
t
hard
to
persuade
him
to
join
them
while
his
first
impression
of
sandy
be
of
someone
gruff
and
unsure
of
himself
berlind
recognize
that
sandy
knew
the
brokerage
business
thoroughly
and
be
very
smart
berlind
also
suggest
that
they
attempt
to
recruit
his
friend
peter
potoma
another
broker
at
eastman
dillon
not
only
be
potoma
married
to
money
he
be
an
italian
and
so
more
welcome
on
the
new

exchange

when
he
get
excite
about
an
idea
and
one
of
the

however

argument
broke
out
frequently
over
who

make
the
most
money
for
the

warn
his

from

bad
still
from
the
viewpoint
of
sandy
and
berlind
carter
be
clearly
favor
the
strong
personality
and
financial
contribution
of
arthur
levitt
and
marshall
cogan
both
of
whom
have
join
the
three
founder
on
the
executive
committee

brought
the
firm
its
first
acquisition
a
small
investment
management
firm
call
bernstein
macaulay
in
and
cogan
be
clearly
become
a
star
deal
maker
with
his
high
profile
transaction
neither
sandy
nor
roger
berlind
confront
carter
but
they
be
become
deeply
resentful
of
his
imperious
attitude
toward
them
after
all
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
their
early
success
in
attract
client
to
buy
and
sell

discover
by
sandy
s
research
there
wouldn
t
even
be
a
carter
berlind
weill
arthur
carter
be
question
whether
he
want
to
stay
in
the
brokerage
business
or
take
the
firm
in
another
direction
he
have
discussion
with
both
cogan
and
levitt
suggest
that
the
three
of
them
use
their
majority
vote
on
the
executive
committee
to
slash
his
cofounder
share
of
the
firm
to
a
mere
percent
a
level
that
would
surely
force
them
to
leave
neither
cogan
nor
levitt
commit
themselves
to
the
coup
but
neither
do
they
outright
reject
it
when
carter
call
an
executive
committee
meeting
on
september
the
five
men
gather
in
a
conference
room
carter
begin
to
set
the
stage
tell
sandy
and
berlind
you
aren
t
pull
your
weight
but
before
he
could
make
his
motion
to
weaken
the
two
men
s
hold
on
the
firm
arthur
levitt
step
in
with
a
motion
to
adjourn
for
a
brief
recess
levitt
drew
sandy
and
berlind
aside
and
told
them
what
be
about
to
happen
that
carter
be
set
them
up
for
the
fire
squad
you
ve
heard
it
with
your
own
ear
levitt
warn
the
two
men
if
arthur
will
do
this
to
you
it
s
just
a
matter
of
time
before
he
pull
the
same
stunt
on
me
he
told
the
stun
pair
that
he
have
hurriedly
consult
with
bialkin
who
review
the
firm
s
charter
and
bylaw
and
conclude
that
the
partner
could
override
carter
i
propose
we
kick
carter
out
and
do
it
today
levitt
say
sandy
resist
his
long
friendship
with
carter
balance
against
the
man
s
duplicity
perhaps
they
should
warn
him
to
start
look
for
another
job
sandy
suggest
but
levitt
press
his
point
i
m
tell
you
if
you
keep
arthur
in
the
firm
he

when

meeting
reconvene
minute
later
levitt

role
of
executioner

he
told
carter
you

his
departure
as
friendly
explain
that
he
have
resign
because
basically
i
want
to

that
something

in
the

indeed
within
a
month
carter

and
soon

sandy
traumatize
by
the
sudden
turn
of
event
stood
quietly
in
a
corner
during
the
meeting
he
realize
that
this
be
an
opportunity
to
fill
the
leadership
void
but
he
couldn
t
muster
the
courage
i
m
afraid
to
be
out
front
he
thought
where
people
can
see
my
mistake
the
break
between
carter
and
sandy
weill
the
original
founder
who
plot
over
dinner
with
their
wife
and
little
boy
be
especially
hard
on
sandy
after
the
shock
disappointment
he
have
experienced
year
earlier
at
the
hand
of
his
father
sandy
value
loyalty
deeply
and
carter
would
come
to
realize
that
his
cold
demeanor
meant
the
end
of
his
good
friendship
with
sandy
although
the
restructuring
of
the
firm
go
swiftly
sandy
be
scar
none
of
the
partner
have
any
experience
manage
what
have
become
a
decent
size
firm
sandy
berlind
and
levitt
knew
they
need
cogan
who
have
become
the
firm
s
big
revenue
generator
to
prevent
him
from
leave
carter
try
to
entice
him
away
to
join
his
new
venture
they
offer
him
top
billing
in
the
new
firm
he
agree
and
cogan
berlind
weill
levitt
be
born
soon
afterward
the
weill
and
levitts
go
out
to
dinner
together
the
wife
try
to
relieve
their
husband
worry
by
bantering
about
way
they
could
save
money
include
buying
just
one
set
of
bar
mitzvah
clothes
that
their
son
could
share
but
sandy
couldn
t
make
light
of
the
firm
s
suddenly
perilous
future
he
have
be
shaken
to
the
core
practically
his
only
comment
that
even
make
over
and
over
god
can
we
survive

corn
beef
with
lettuce
the
new
firm
of
cogan
berlind
weill
levitt
may
have
be
a
traumatic
victory
for
the
participant
but
it
didn
t
inspire
any
respect
on
wall

mock
the
jewish
partner
initial
the
street
s
merciless
jokester
quickly
brand
the

corn
beef
with

thus
it
wasn
t
very
difficult
for
sandy
weill
and
roger
berlind
the
two
remain

to
take
an
important
step

sandy
vowed
the

to
its
prospective

the

client
sandy
s
old
bos
told
the
young
firm
to
take
its
clearing
business
elsewhere
the
logical
place
to
turn
be
the
esteem
firm
of
loeb
rhoades
which
handle
clearing
operation
for
many
small
firm
of

size
because
john
langeloth
loeb
one
of
the
patriarch
of
german
jew
on
wall
street
insist
that
his
firm
would
clear
trade
only
for
firm
of
the
high
quality
and
prestige
hook
up
with
loeb
rhoades
would
be
a
sign
to
the
rest
of
the
financial
community
that
cbwl
be
no
joking
matter
yet
when
sandy
ask
john
loeb
if
he
would
take
on
their
clearing
business
the
patrician
mr
loeb
told
him
in
no
uncertain
term
that
his
firm
already
be
operating
at
capacity
and
would
not
handle
their
clearing
sandy
knew
loeb
rhoades
could
easily
deal
with
the
volume
of
cbwl
s
business
if
it
want
to
it
be
a
snub
he
wouldn
t
forget
and
one
that
john
loeb
would
come
to
regret
stung
by
loeb
s
insult
sandy
begin
to
think
about
set
up
a
back
office
facility
at
cbwl
to
clear
its
own
trade
such
a
move
wouldn
t
have
be
possible
in
the
early
day
when
the
partner
be
struggle
to
pay
office
rent
but
the
firm
have
incorporate
a
few
year
earlier
and
the
owner
have
be
plow
nearly
all
their
profit
back
into
the
business
rather
than
distribute
the
proceeds
to
the
partner
as
do
many
of
the
old
line
firm
there
be
enough
cash
to
set
up
a
back
office
operation
and
the
decade
s
bull
market
have
give
the
cbwl
executive
the
confidence
that
their
fee
and
commission
would
cover
the
significant
fix
cost
until
they
could
grow
enough
to
use
all
that
clearing
capacity
who
would
set
up
and
run

operation

on
his

up
with
the

that
the

be
for

and
the
back
office
for
poor
kid
like
me
not
surprisingly
he
take
an
instant
like
to
the
four
men
he
met
in
the
general
motor
building
to
his
delight
they
be
a
lot
like
him
blunt
brash
roll
up
your

manager
much
of
his
interview
consist
of
the
four
cbwl
executive
talk
simultaneously
to
him
and
to
one
another
raise
their
voice
or
curse
to
try
to
get
the
others
attention
but
it
be
sandy
who
bowl
over
zarb
once
the
two
begin
focus
on
the
nut
and
bolt
of
become
a
self
clearing
operation
zarb
quickly
realize
that
sandy
knew
more
about
the
subject
than
anyone
he
have
ever
met
broker
think
of
the
security
business
as
a
telephone
and
a
customer
zarb
thought
but
sandy
be
intimately
familiar
with
every
aspect
of
the
business
sandy
ticked
off
a
list
of
problem
inefficiency
and
ineptness
that
marked
most
clearing
operation
pause
to
be
sure
zarb
agree
that
none
of
those
problem
would
plague
a
cbwl
back
office
already
the
antiquate
clearing
system
in
use
be
be
overwhelmed
by
the
massive
paperwork
that
a
long
bull
market
create
the
paralyze
paper
crunch
force
the
new
york
stock
exchange
to
begin
closing
on
wednesday
simply
to
allow
brokerage
house
some
breathing
room
to
catch
up
on
the
transfer
of
money
and
security
now
sandy
demand
the
attention
of
his
colleague
to
avoid
the
mess
other
brokerage
firm
be
experience
and
to
provide
room
for
the
future
growth
of
their
clearing
business
sandy
and
zarb
conclude
that
they
would
have
to
start
from
scratch
with
the
most
advanced
automate
processing
technology
and
they
would
have
to
build
a
system
that
could
handle
triple
their
current
volume
this
pipeline
will
be
our
platform
for

sandy
told
his
fellow
executive
cogan
berlind

be

a

its

still
sandy
persist
in
his
lecture
recall
a
lesson
from
his

forward
to
take
over
arthur

the

about

that
none

neither

would
admit
it

they
need
each

and
run
scar
the

whose
mastery
of

while
shearson
field
broker
in

loeb

also
would
give

banking
business
which
have
languish
after

this
crowd
sandy
the
board
doesn
t
want
to
name
you
president

right

robinson
told
him
you
will
be
chairman
of

committee
and
of
course
a
director
sandy

joan
be
dumbfound
at
such
a
nebulous
do
nothing
corporate
position
but
robinson
knew
he
be
lucky
to
get
that
for
sandy
robinson
have
just
spent
the
entire
day
be
grill
by
his
director
who
be
very
uncomfortable
with
sandy
weill
aware
of
sandy
s
no
hold
bar
tactic
and
raw
ambition
the
director
be
terrify
that
he
would
take
over
american
express
even
if
they
agree
to
get
into
the
security
business
they
weren
t
convince
it
should
be
with

and
sandy
weill
lead
by
the
imperious
howard
clark
sr
and
rawleigh
warner
the
director
refuse
to
buy
shearson
without
certain
condition
design
to
limit

power
they
insist
that
alva
way
a
senior

to
be
robinson
s
number
two
the
director
name
gerstner
a
vice
chairman
also
they
reject
sandy
s
choice
of
bialkin
on
the
ground
that
the
board
didn
t
want
a
lawyer
as
a
director
instead
they
chose
advertising
man
dan
seymour
and
sandy
s
chief
deputy
peter
cohen
over
the
weekend
cohen
have
present
his
case
for
a

slot
directly
to

without
a
board
seat
he
couldn
t
commit
to
stay
at
shearson
beyond
the
transition
of
course
robinson
didn
t
dare
confide
what
lay
behind
all
these
machination
to
sandy
who
he
sense
be
about
to
call
off
the
deal
instead
he
told
him
that
the
board
have
appoint
his
ally
seymour
and
cohen
and
in
his
sugarcoat
southern
accent
he
assure
sandy
that
he
would
rise
quickly
at
the
blue
chip
company
as
soon
as
the
board
get
to
know
him
without
a
position
of
authority
from
the
board
sandy
have
to
decide
whether
he
could
trust
jim
robinson
who
be
so
polished
he
be
difficult
to
read
what
s
your
net
worth
sandy
demand
robinson
who
be
startle
at
this
blunt
question
say
he
be
wealthy
but
nothing
compare
to
the
million
sandy
would
pocket
if
he
sell
shearson
and
end
up
with
american
express
share
compare
to

paltry

confrontational
tactic

how
different
he
be
from
robinson
who
remain
calm
and
diplomatic
sandy
be
torn
visibly
shaken
by
his
dilemma
while
his
first
instinct
be
to
tell
robinson
what
to
do
with
his
vague
promise
and
waspy
board
he
have
come
close
enough
to
the
cachet
and
clout
of
american
express
to
want
a
role
there
even
more
still

idea

he
sign
the
letter
to
shareholder
in
the
annual
report
along
with
robinson
and
way
sure
concede
robinson
who
knew
this
gesture
be
more
symbolic
than
substantive
increasingly
aware
that
sandy
s
role
at
american
express
be
more
important
to
him
than

time
will
come

meeting
be
set
for
the
next
week
august
to
evaluate
the

purchase
but
the
meeting
would
be
more
than
just
a
consideration
of
a
deal
it
would
be
a
vote
of
confidence
in
sandy
weill
as
well
as
the
acquisition
s
proponent
sandy
make
the
presentation
to
the
executive
seat
around
the
long
mahogany
table
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
actually
put
on
a
slide
show
in
the
american
express
tradition
sheinberg
who
have
know
sandy
for
nearly
two
decade
thought
to
himself
this
be
the
reverse
of
the
real
sandy
weill
this
be
a
snow
job
a
con
job
so
you
re
stoop
to
this
my
friend
you
re
so
desperate
to
get
back
in
the
game
after
the
show
and
tell
robinson
go
around
the
room
for
opinion
from
the
executive
include
gerstner
who
have
concern
about
tarnish
the
pristine
image
of
american
express
with
such
a
lowbrow
operation
when
a
question
arose
about
take
on
a
steel
subsidiary
as
part
of
the
deal
one
of
sandy
s
aide
jumped
in
actually
we
project
a
steel
company
profit
of
ten
million
dollar
he
say
where
do
you
get
that
interject
a
surprised
sheinberg
who
have
be
assign
the
due
diligence
of
the
steel
unit
because
of
his
experience
with
factory
at
bulova
that
s
bullshit
this
company
be
lucky
if
it
break
even
my
guess
be
it
will
lose
money
embarrass
and
furious
that
his
pitch
be
be
undermined
sandy
explode
why
didn
t
you
say
anything
before
this
i
just
get
back
from
a
trip
to
that
site
sheinberg
reply
assume
that
the
candor
that
have
always
marked
their
relationship
at
shearson
be
what
sandy
expect
of
him
but
this
time
sandy
felt
ambush
stabbed
in
the
back
by
one
of
his
own
men
sheinberg
have
commit
the
cardinal
sin
of
disloyalty
the
billion
id
deal
die
at
that
meeting
so
do
the
longtime
friendship
between
sandy
and
sheinberg
sandy
didn
t
speak
to
the
treasurer
for
several
month
until
he
left

coldly
inform
sheinberg

over
which

that
be
our

when
i
join
you

how

warmer
and
more
intimate

compare
to
the
snobbier
lincoln

but
as
he
attend
more
concert
he
also
found
that
he
could
let
the
music
sweep
over
him
and
erase
the
day
s
worry
and
concern
as

he
found

with
question
about

often
chose
to
sit
with

between

he
would
question

one
point

be
stun
that
he
have
caught
the
similarity
between

played
by

just
about

sandy
quickly
discover
a
major

the

on

could
relax
a
little
drop
their
corporate
armor
in
favor
of
joking
and
backslapping
they
would
whisper
in
corner
and
agree
to
call
one
another
the
next
day
after
two
decade
of

with

be
perfectly
at
home
in
the
intimate
confines
of
the
club
room
a
place
he
call
warm
and
fuzzy
initially
sandy
have
be
reluctant
to
take
on
the
job
of
cochairing
the
fund
raise
to
restore

can
hear

stern
whisper
with
his
long
workday
at
american

behind
him
sandy
could
throw
himself
wholeheartedly
into
his
carnegie
hall
work
he
be
thrill
that
other
executive
take
his
call
and
agree
to
dine
with
him
to
discus
the
project
it
s
go
to
cost
you
to
talk
to
me
about
this
he
would
jokingly
warn
his
target
he
confide
to
dimon
that
when
he
be
at
american
express
he
always
wonder
if
people
want
him
for
himself
or
because
of
his
position
it
s
a
turn
on
that
people
listen
to
me
even
though
i
m
no
longer
the
president
of
american
express
or
chairman
of
shearson
he
say
sandy
work
out
an
effective
pitch
that
often
begin
with
cocktail
at
the
weill
apartment
where
guest
would
be
show
a
video
about
the
hall
s
history
if
a
well
know
musician
be
in
town
the
cocktail
hour
might
include
a
brief
recital
then
it
be
off
to
dinner
at
the
russian
tea
room
and
on
to
a
concert
at
the
hall
sandy
want
to
get
his
potential
donor
into
the
concert
hall
not
only
so
they
could
appreciate
the
music
but
also
to
provide
them
with
a
firsthand
look
at
how
their
contribution
would
be
use
in
addition
to
point
out
the
many
crack
in
the
ceiling
he
would
encourage
his
guest
to
touch
the
wall
in
the
box
seat
you
get
a
special
feel
when
you
touch
the
wall
he
would
say
the
feel
be
damp
water
leak
into
the
box
from
the
restroom
above
while
sandy
genuinely
want
to
see
carnegie
hall
restore
and
he
found
the
business
contact
he
make
work
on
the
board
valuable
in
the
aftermath
of
american
express
his
association
with
the
famous
hall
go
beyond
all
that
if
he
have
learn
anything
from
jim
robinson
and
the
aloof
american
express
executive
it
be
the
importance
of
presentation
and
persona
as
much
as
performance
despite
a
lack
of
social
grace
or
important
connection
sandy
have
power
his
way
to
the
top
of
shearson
by
outperform
everyone
around
him
yet
he
found
at
the
high
reach
of
corporate
politics
that
just
be
the
best
executive
hadn
t
be
enough
sandy
knew
he
need
the
credential
and
clout
that
would
appeal
to
establishment
company
and
their
board
of
director
carnegie
hall
be
become
the
vehicle
that
would
enable
sandy
to
go
beyond
the
one
note
theme
of
besting
everyone
in
sight
and
on
to
orchestrate
a
place
for
himself
and
joan
among
the
broader
cultural
and
social
fabric
of
new
york
dither
while
carnegie
hall
give
sandy
a
focal
point
for
some
of
his
energy
it
be
a
far
cry
from
have
a
company
to
run
as
the
summer
wore
on
sandy
and
dimon
fell
into
a
pattern
both
would
comb
the
new
york
time
the
wall
street
journal
and
every
major
business
magazine
on
his
way
home
from
dinner
sandy
would
routinely
have
his
driver
pull
over
at
a
newsstand
so
he
could
get
an
early
edition
of
the
next
day
s
time
he
scan
it
before
go
to
bed
hop
that
some
tidbit
would
inspire
him
to
dream
about
a
possible
deal
he
could
pursue
the
next
day
dimon
would
sit
at
home
in
his
underwear
scan
the
time
and
the
journal
while
sip
his
morning
coffee
at
the
office
where
sandy
arrive
punctually
at
a
m
if
he
didn
t
have
a
power
breakfast
at
the
swank
regency
hotel
he
would
spend
much
of
his
time
place
phone
call
while
dimon
make
it
his
task
to
accumulate
and
examine
all
the
financial
document
on
any
company
in
which
they
might
conceivably
be
interested
almost
any
possibility
for
get
back
into
business
even
some
deal
that
dimon
call
little
rinky
dinkers
would
generate
some
enthusiasm
in
sandy
at

briefly
there

for

tiny

in

and
one
in

neck
long

sandy
go
so
far
as
to
ask
a
top
official
at
shearson
lehman
if
his
old
firm
would
clear
for
him
since

too
small

sandy
intend
to
show
the
bank
s
board
before
their
february
meeting
sandy
make
his
first
approach
to
bankamerica
corp
quietly
call
certain
board
member
to
inform
them
of
his
plan
and
the
commitment
he
have
in
hand
for
the
billion
infusion
the

so
desperately
need
but
the
stuffy

want
nothing
to
do

with
the
exception
of
schwab

contact
be
noncommittal
or

proposal
outright

sandy
conclude
he
would
take
his
proposal
public
hop
to
bring
sufficient
pressure
on
the

from
shareholder

the

attempt
to
paint
him
as
a
pathetic
job
applicant
and
a
hostile
suitor
even
bad
the
rejection
may
have
lain
in
the
fact
of
his
jewish
heritage
james
calvano

him
as
much
during
a
golf
game
shortly
after

he

for

picked
up
the

neither

the

indeed
they

for
someone
with
sandy

background
and
skill
he
be
just
the
kind
of
leader
the

they

with

discussion
of

sandy
ask
them

s
simultaneous
queasiness
about
go
behind
his

back
to
appeal
directly
to

when
sandy
hung
up
he
briefed
dimon
on
the

ask
him
to
hunt
down
the

sandy
hadn
t
need
to
ask
his
caller
much
about
the

because

mediocre
financial

to
a
largely
blue
collar
customer
base
yet
two
year
later
the
ail

company
didn
t
seem
so
pedestrian
to

out
from

would

if
anyone
knew
about

they
also
fear
that
their
boss
would
laugh
at
the
idea
of
recruiting
sandy
weill
to
run
the

they

what
the
hell
they
be
go
to
meet
sandy

the
risk
be
worth
it
when

building
a
very
nervous
volland

brace
themselves

they
simply
want
him
to
be
the

of
their

to
turn

around
they
didn

something
that

something
he
want
to
be
the
absolute
ruler
of

he
ran
unless
sandy
and

could
figure
out
a
way
to
free
commercial

from
control
data
and
be
in
full
control
of

so
other

company
on
the
waste
heap
of

idea
sandy
and
dimon
immediately
begin
brainstorming
way
to
make
commercial
credit
independent
as
they
evaluate
it
as
a
stand
alone
business
they
be
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
wasn
t
as
dinky
as
they
originally
thought
the
company
have
office
in
twenty
eight

of

and
asset

construct
a
chart
plot
the
ten
year
financial
performance
of
similar

company
every
decent
company
have
a
return
on
equity
in
excess
of
percent
and
an
annual
growth
rate
of
percent
or
more
not
surprisingly
commercial
credit
ranked
near
the
bottom
with
a
measly
percent
return
on
equity
but
that
be
okay
with
sandy
and
dimon
all
they
have
to
do
be
to
manage
commercial
credit
so
that
it
reach
the
industry
average
on
growth
and
return
on

that
would
produce
a
powerful
surge
in
the

earnings
and
ultimately
in
its

if
it

that

wasn

that
the

of

it

chortle
dimon
it

a
high

business
with

of

he
note
that
unlike

which
borrow

for

and
lend
them
for
long

consumer

make

at

while

in
practical
term
that
meant
that
rise

which
hurt

earnings
badly
wouldn
t
be
a
significant
factor
for
a
consumer

sandy
agree
it
s
not
the
kind
of
business
where
you
need
big
reserve
to
protect
yourself
from
the
unknown
because
you
write
off
a

in
six
month
in

word
commercial

have
the
potential
to

an
enormous

as
it
could
borrow
low
and
lend
high
of
course
one
of
commercial
credit
s
major
problem
be
that
it
couldn
t
borrow
low
because
lender
be
afraid
control
data
s
cascade
problem
would
mean
any
loan
they
make
to
commercial

might
not
be
repaid
the
debt
rating
agency
have
downgrade
commercial

several
time
thus
lender
demand
much
high

rate
to
make

to
the

those
high

to
mount
a
turnaround
he
have
forgotten
to
inspire
his

what
his

some
good
old
time
religion
on
the
value
of

that

make
them
want
to
work
harder
he
thought
sandy
call
an
employee
meeting
in
the
cafeteria
the
scene
of
the
independence
day
party
when
he
first
take
the
company
public
a
few
month
earlier
of
course
sandy
want
a
full
day
of
work
first
so
he
call
the
meeting
for
five
o
clock
with
their
benefit
cut
to
the
bone
the
employee
now
a
small
group
after
the
layoff
face
their
bos
with
trepidation
i
want
every
one
of
you
to
become
a
shareholder
in
this
company
sandy
begin
with
stock
option
you
be
an
owner
in
commercial
credit
just
as
i
be
mannes
have
warn
sandy
that
he
would
have
to
educate
an
entire
population
about
stock
option
accustom
to
paycheck
and
bonus
the
employee
be
unsure
what
sandy
be
talk
about
do
we
buy
the
option
in
the
stock
market
one
middle
manager
ask
sandy
explain
that
option
be
give
by
the
company
to
its
employee
they
enable
the
employee
at
some
future
date
to
buy
the
company
s
stock
at
a
certain
price
which
if
they
work
hard
and
the
company
do
well
would
be
less
than
what
outside
investor
would
have
to
pay
to
buy
the
stock
on
an
exchange
option
would
soon
become
part
of
the
compensation
and
retirement
package
for
most
employee
he
promise
your
option
be
really
go
to
matter
the
ceo
say
i
want
you
to
get
wealthy
on
this
too
we
be
all
in
this
he

that

credit
s
new
board
of
director
include
former
president
gerald
ford
be
paid
in
stock
alone
can
i
take
an
option
to
the
grocery
store
ask
another
employee
sandy
try
to
explain
that
an
option
isn
t
money
that
can
be
spent
i
would
rather
have
the
money
than
a
stock
option
the
employee
retort
you
think
that
now
sandy
counter
but
your
option
one
day
could
be
worth
a
lot
more
than
any
money
you
would
be
give
today
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
i
m
put
in
place
an
environment
where
you
will
want
to
succeed
he
try
another
explanation
you
have
to
reap
the
benefit
not
just
of
what
you
earn
for
a
salary
but
also
in
how
well
the
company
do
remember
you
re
not
just
an
employee
you
re
an
owner
just
like
i
be
let
s
work
like
owner
most
employee
even
an
operation
manager
like
herb
seligson
still
didn
t
grasp
what
sandy
be
promote
i
just
don
t
understand
him
seligson
told
a
colleague
as
they
be
leave
the
cafeteria
he
s
keep
our
salary
low
but
tell
us
we
ll
still
do
well
how
can
we
create
our
own
wealth
by
work
hard
all
i
know
be
that
stock
option
must
not
cost
him
much
to
give
because
he
won
t
give
us
the
cash
his
colleague
reply
the
offer
of
option
might
not
have
turn
sentiment
back
in
sandy
s
favor
but
his
continue
and
obvious
dedication
to
the
company
have
a
beneficial
effect
on
morale
the
long
hour
and
his
deep
and
intimate
knowledge
of
the
company
and
its
people
make
last
impression
on
the
employee
who
come
in

with
him
no

where

when
the

calvano
told

dryly
their

on
criterion
such
as
the
volume
quality

average

also
each

would
prepare

statement

that
would
provide
a
clearer
picture

propose
a

unheard

in

industry
the

secondary
willumstad
reflect
as

then
he

during

for
the
company
to
raise
more

harris
suggest
sell
smith
barney
albeit
at
a
considerably
low
price
than
tsai
have

for
it
and
concentrate
on
the
remain

but
tsai

that
customer
paid
in
the
first
few
year
of
a

just
as
sandy
predict
the
noose
be

harris
begin
examine
a
number
of
option
that
primerica
might
pursue
to
extricate
itself
from

give
him
extra

to
tsai
maybe

he
chose
his

the

would
enable

to
get
the
best
possible

have
grown
increasingly

a
year
by
get
a
piece
of
every

concern
at
one
rally
sandy

here
i
shouldn
t
say
that
in
an
expensive
effort
to
convert
williams
into
an
employee
rather
than
a
free
agent
sandy
paid
million
in

out
the
percent
of

justified
the

tag
on
the
ground
that
he
need
to
gain
sole
authority
over
the

with
its

to

knew
all
too
well
how
powerful

the

harder
so
the

before

we

repeatedly
told
sandy
beyond
that
he
warn
sandy
that
get

now
he

the

that
his
mere
arrival
could
increase
primerica
s
market
capitalization
by
nearly
billion
part
of
that
delight
may
also
have
be
due

the
fact
that

have
just
make
million
on

to
their
sedate
old
fashion
way
of
do
business
with
a
loyal
clientele
they
resent
the
more
aggressive
and
obnoxious
shearson
broker
and
the
broker
from
both
firm
be
the
subject
of
constant
ridicule
and
disparagement
from
the
swagger
morgan

banker
day
in
and
day
out
it
be
at
morgan
we
do
it
like
this
or
you
should
see
how
it

do
at

greenhill
even
held
secret
morning
meeting
with
his
team
before
the
usual
eight
o
clock
firm
meeting
yet
sandy
seem
oblivious
to
the
rocky
relationship
at
least
in
part
because
greenhill
get
off
to
a
quick
start
bagging
the
role
of
advisor
to
viacom
inc
in
its
megadeal
to
acquire
paramount
communication
inc
for
billion
with
greenhill
flit
around
the
country
to
meet
potential
client
in
their
boardroom
primerica
executive
wonder
aloud
if
greenhill
could
be
both
a
rainmaker
and
an
effective
administrator
yes
he
can
reply
sandy
determine
his
new
and
expensive
experiment
would
work
if
he
have
good
partner
to
ensure
that
greenhill
have
the
best
possible
partner
sandy
dispatch
jamie
dimon
to
become
the
de
facto
manager
of
smith
barney

although
he
have
no
official
role
dimon
begin
spending
up
to
percent
of
his
work
hour
at
the
security
firm
to
get
well
control
of
management
he
take
an
office
next
to
greenhill
s
sandy
believe
that
dimon
would
easily
compensate
for
greenhill
s
administrative
shortcoming
certainly
the
shearson
and
smith
barney
broker
like
the
idea
that
dimon
s
steady
hand
and
sharp
mind
be
guide
the
business
they
love
the
outgo
and
smart
primerica
president
whose
own
father
be
a
broker
in
their
rank
even
as
they
resent
the
newcomer
the
broker
and
trader
knew
if
dimon
could
hold
his
own
with
a
tough
sob
like
sandy
weill
he
wouldn
t
be
railroad
by
greenhill
and
his
crony
dimon
be
appalled
at
what
he
found
greenhill
have
go
overboard
in
hire
new
banker
and
the
one
he
have
hire
be
inexperienced
you
re
give
them
job
far
beyond
what
they
can
do
dimon
complain
bad
still
greenhill
be
pay
them
small

the

worried
this
be
so
unlike
sandy
a
zealot
about
modest
salary
offset
by
huge

of

at

all
kind
of
jealousy
besides
if
these

people
who
will
leave
a
place
for
more
money
they
ll
leave
you

pearson
become
so
concerned
about
the

on

nevertheless
jessica

knew
they
need
to
name
someone
to
the
job
they
consider
jessica
for
the
post
dimon
didn
t
think
she
deserve
it
their
colleague
held
their
breath
and
wait
to
see
if
sandy
would
force
dimon
to
promote
his
daughter
jeff
lane
the
vice
chairman
who
have
earlier
told
sandy
and
dimon
that
jessica
shouldn
t
work
at
the
firm
now
have
the
opposite
advice
for
dimon
promote
her
he
warn
know
that
sandy
would
brook
no
interference
with
his
grand
plan
not
even
from
dimon
you
re
kill
yourself
if
you
don
t
officially
sandy
take
a
hand
off
position
but
unofficially
he
urge
his
second
in
command
to
give
her
the
job
she
want
marc
already
have
a
senior
level
position
and
jessica
be
ready
for
one
as
well
dimon
disagreed
i
don
t
want
her
to
do
it
the
smith
barney
ceo
told
sandy
and
his
other
executive
she
s
not
ready
for
the
job
it
s
that
simple
sandy
clearly
want
jessica
to
get
the
big
job
but
he
wasn
t
willing
to
demand
that
dimon
promote
her
still
he
hop
and
probably
expect
that
his
prot
g
would
select
jessica
for
the
post
dimon
do
exactly
what
he
thought
be
right
he
picked
a
more
senior
finance
veteran
robert
druskin
to
head
asset
management
the
bos
s
daughter
learn
that
she
didn
t
get
the
job
from
an
acquaintance
at
another
company
she
didn
t
expect
to
get
the
post
over
druskin
who
have
be
with
her
father
since
his
shearson
day
however
jessica
still
resent

increase
unwillingness
to

contribution
after
all
she
oversaw
two
third

many
people
in

himself
caught
between

both
of
whom
he

jamie

the
split
in
the
year
since

have
promote
robert
druskin
to
oversee
all
of
traveler

for
the
post
relation
between
sandy
s
daughter
and
sandy
s
closest
deputy
have
continued
to
worsen
although
jessica
report
to
druskin
and
thus
didn
t
attend
many
meeting
at
which
dimon
be
also
present
the
few
time
the
two
be
in
the
same
room
it
be
painfully
clear
to
others
that
the
rift
be
deepen
no
one
least
of
all
dimon
dispute
that
jessica
do
a
wonderful
job
as
the
spokesperson
for
smith
barney
s
mutual
fund
her
charm
and
wit
get
the
attention
of
television
producer
and
newspaper
reporter
and
she
be
frequently
quote
or
interviewed
that
s
free
promotion
for
our
product
dimon
told
her
approvingly
but
when
dimon
and
jessica
be
involve
in
a
meeting
about
operation
or
financial
performance
dimon
frequently
found
fault
with
her
presentation
and
her
lack
of
knowledge
you
ve
get
to
know
the
detail
he
admonish
her
at
one
meeting
he
also
push
her
to
boost
the
sale
of
smith
barney
s
own
fund
which
carry
much
big
profit
than
other
mutual
fund
company
product
that
smith
barney
also
offer
at
other
big
brokerage
firm
in
house
fund
account
for
half
or
more
of
all
sale
but
they
be
only
about
a
third
of
smith
barney
s
sale
you
ve
get
to
sell
more
do
more
make
more
dimon
told
jessica
in
his
staccato
style
jessica
suggest
that
to
get
their
broker
to
push
their
in
house
fund
smith
barney
should
pay
the
broker
big
commission
to
sell
them
i
refuse
to
do
that
dimon
counter
it
give
the
wrong
incentive
customer
should
want
to
buy
our
fund
because
of
performance
and
service
not
because
the
broker
push
them
harder
so
he
can
put
more
money
in
his
own
pocket
that
s
not
in
the
customer
s
best
interest
dimon
s
cocksure
demeanor
and
his
moralistic
argument
be
typical
of
him
his
colleague
knew
but
they
also
sense
that
it
be
embarrass
to
jessica
to
be
lecture
that
way
when
jessica
introduce
a
new
mutual
fund
product
the
concert
series
design
for
corporate
k
program
dimon
dismiss
it
to
colleague
as
a
lot
of
noise
a
lot
of
mirror
the
fund
didn
t
sell
well
and
as
jessica
continued
to
fall
short
of
his
standard
dimon
saw
to
it
that
her
job
become
more
one
of
public
relation
than
operation
although
jessica
be
nominally
the
head
of
smith
barney
s
mutual
fund
operation
dimon
rely
on
the
operation
manager
more
like
himself
jessica
s
isolation
be
exacerbate
because
colleague
kept
her
out
of
the
information
flow
for
fear
she
would
report
to
her
father
finally
jessica
decide
she
should
remove
herself
from
the
contentious
environment
at
headquarters
and
take
up
dimon
s
stand
offer
to
manage
one
of
smith
barney

about
how
to

to
the

of

we
could
start

if
it
make
any
sense
the
fifty

ecstatic
he
hadn

be
reject
outright

start

right
now
he
say
whoa
thought
warner
he
have
to
slow
the
pace
of
this
thing
he
stood
up
and
walk
over
to
the

sure
we

j

be
here
one

later
because
we

true
to

culture
didn
t

he
say
still
these
two
men
as
different
as
their

have
enough
camaraderie
and

to
continue

because
of

that
separate

simply
assume
that

want
to
explore
a

it
didn

with
all
of

so
without
confirm
his
assumption

agree
that
they
should
get
their

to
the

in
a

at

practically
float
all
the
way
back
to

to

with

how
can
we
take

demand
aware
from

to

that

that
two
to

though
his

first
to

that

i
m
sure
you

about

i
believe

to
respect
them
just
because
they
have
a
name
still
dimon
agree
with
sandy
that
j
p
morgan
represent
a
unique
opportunity
worth
pursue
both
side
spent
the
summer
of
secretly
exchange
volume
of
information
evaluate
area
of
overlap
and
consider
new
activity
that
could
be
undertaken
if
some
form
of
combination
be
work
out
during
that
summer
sandy
and
traveler
director
arthur
zankel
flew
to
san
francisco
for
a
benefit
on
behalf
of
carnegie
hall
where
both
be
director
on
the
return
flight
sandy
confide
to
zankel
that
he
be
negotiate
with
j
p
morgan
that
s
one
of
the
bad
idea
i
ve
ever
heard
zankel
told
him
his
long
friendship
with
sandy
allow
him
to
be
blunt
they
ll
never
sell
to
a
guy
like
you
up
from
the
street
un
gentile
you
d
be
fight
the
establishment
all
over
again
you
ll
never
live
long
enough
to
be
the
chief
executive
officer
of
that
company
then
sandy
brought
the
matter
of
the
merger
to
his
full
board
of
director
who
he
hop
would
be
more
supportive
than
zankel
have
be
he
be
wrong
the
culture
between
traveler
and
j
p
morgan
would
be
oil
and
water
say
joseph
califano
who
be
in
a
position
to
know
he
have
married
hilary
paley
daughter
of
the
wealthy
cbs
patriarch
william
paley
morgan
handle
the
trust
for
my
wife
s
family
and
the
culture
would
never
go
together
now
sandy
be
worried
he
have
to
know
directly
from
sandy
warner
if
these
discussion
be
bound
to
be
futile
warner
have
retreat
for
the
month
of
august
to
his
family
summer
house
in
the
little
hamlet
of
we
quetonsing
michigan
near
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
but
that
didn
t
stop
sandy
from
insist
on
a
face
to
face
meeting
the
traveler
jet
could
land
at
the
small
airport
in
pellston
michigan
tuck
his
favorite
gift
into
his
briefcase
he
ask
chuck
prince
to
ride
along
to
plot
strategy
this
might
be
their
only
chance
to
convince
warner
to
move
ahead
with
the
merger
sandy
and
prince
brainstorm
various
scenario
on
their
way
to
michigan
one
concession
that
sandy
be
more
than
happy
to
make
keep
the
j
p
morgan
name
there
isn
t
a
well
name
he
told
prince
as
the
plane
settle
onto
the
runway
in
pellston
sandy
be
clearly
rid
high
prince
who
would
remain
on
the
plane
while
the
two
titan
negotiate
try
to
bring
his
bos
back
down
to
earth
my
impression
be
the
morgan
people
basically
would
be
happy
to
merge
if
we
would
all
just
disappear
warner
be
wait
on
the
tarmac
attire
in
casual
summer
clothes
he
welcome
sandy
to
the
country
as
they
climbed
into
his
jeep
when
the
pair
arrive
at
warner
s
house
a
rustic
uninsulated
version
of
a
victorian
cottage
sandy
present
his
gift
to
the
j
p
morgan
chairman
two
tie
decorate
with
float
umbrella
against
different
color
background
let
s
work
out
a
merger
so
you
can
wear
these
tie
sandy
say
optimistically
try
to
get
the
conversation
start
on
a
positive
note
as
they
sip
coffee
on
warner
s
porch
overlook
lake
michigan
the
two
men
unencumbered
by
anxious
aide
or
corporate
trapping
cut
straight
to
the
chase
who
would
run
the
merge
company
if
a
deal
be
do
the
fifty
year
old
warner
clearly
expect
to
be
run
his
company
for
year
to
come
yet
the
sixty
four
year
old
sandy
have
no
intention
of
step
down
from
the
ceo
post
the
traveler
chairman
offer
a
compromise
they
would
share
the
senior
post
we
ll
be
equal
he
say
no
warner
answer
immediately
lack
of
clarity
in
leadership
be
very
bad
sandy
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
that
particularly
when
warner
note
that
j
p
morgan
have
a
mandatory
retirement
age
of
sixty
five
sandy
i
think
the
world
of
you
but
when
be
you
go
to
retire
warner
ask
i
don
t
want
to
retire
sandy
respond
i
don
t
think
my
shareholder
want
me
to
retire
well
sandy
if
you
re
go
to
stay
around
this
isn
t
go
to
work
out
warner
say
the
traveler
chairman
offer
other
possibility
split
duty
clearer
line
of
command
anything
to
keep
the
merger
alive
let
s
be
sensible
the
j
p
morgan
ceo
counter
when
do
you
want
to
retire
we
ll
work
back
from
that
suddenly
sandy
be
be
ask
to
commit
to
something
he
have
never
really
consider
when
would
he
leave
his
business
his
very
life
he
try
to
be
coy
but
warner
be
clearly
become
frustrate
a
transition
of
twelve
to
eighteen
month
would
be
reasonable
for
you
to
stay
warner
insist
have
both
of
us
hang
around
indefinitely
be
unappealing
to
me
both
men
then
turn
away
from
the
impasse
and
continued
talk
generally
for
an
hour
or
so
each
hop
the
other
would
capitulate
on
the
leadership
issue
but
neither
do
as
sandy
walk
from
the
jeep
to
the
jet
s
stairway
prince
could
see
that
his
bos

earlier
high
spirit
have
be
dash
he
want
me
to
leave
in
a
year
sandy
told
prince
who
have
become
a
close
confidant
whenever
you
leave
a
number
of
other
people

what
sandy
ask
you

course
i

with
you
for
one
i
ll
leave
when

tenacious
as

up
back
in

the

his
need
for

clarity
and
to

about
sell
to

also
want
to
get
some
feel
for
the

your

we
would

kind
of

i
sort
of

more
about
j

have
any
objection
denham
have
already
checked
buffett
be
a
willing
seller
at
the
right
price
but
it
have
to
be
the
entire
company
not
just
part
of
it
at
the
august
meeting
of
the

group
sandy
sought
the
counsel
of
his
senior
executive
dimon
express
the
most
serious
reservation
he
worried
that
salomon
be
too
vulnerable
to
the
unpredictable
ups
and
down
of
financial
market
and
that
it
take
on
too
much
risk
by
trading
so
heavily
for
its
own
account
colleague
wonder
if
dimon
s
reaction
have
more
to
do
with
his
worsen
relationship
with
sandy
than
with

sandy

that
struck
some
of

he

by

well
about

profile

this
isn
t
hard
to
grasp
he
say
although
overall
it

to
accept
as
the

concern
about

ease
the
deal
piece
begin
to
fall
into
place
then
sandy
drop
a
bombshell
on
dimon
i
want
you
to
be
co
ceo
with
deryck
sandy
announce
to
dimon
after
the
two
have
return
to
their
office
from
a
session
at
the
four
season
i
don
t
think
that
s
right
dimon
shot
back
i
don
t
know
why
we
need
to
do
that
we
need
to
have
overlap
in
leadership
sandy
say
it
will
smooth
the
way
for
the
two
side
to
work
together
dimon
upset
stalk
out
of
sandy
s
office
a
few
minute
later
he
be
back
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
for
the
organization
and
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
for
me
he
told
sandy
sandy
didn
t
give
an
inch
and
remain
quiet
as
dimon
spent
the
next
few
day
pace
back
and
forth
between
their
office
stop
in
periodically
with
another
argument
why
maughan
should
not
share
power
with
him
dimon
have
help
build
the
traveler
empire
he
consider
maughan
a
sweet
talk
as
kisser
who
be
far
less
capable
than
himself
dimon
have
already
shoulder
the
burden
of
run
bob
greenhill
s
feeble
excuse
for
an
investment
bank
and
he
shouldn
t
have
to
do
it
again
just
because
sandy
have
fall
head
over
heel
in
love
with
deryck
maughan
it
s
a
stupid
way
to
organize
thing
dimon
told
sandy
i
don
t
want
to
be
co
ceo
with
deryck
finally
as
the
due
diligence
and
contract
negotiation
be
come
to
a
head
sandy
end
the
argument
we
re
go
ahead
with
this
deal
and
this
be
the
way
we
ll
do
it
you
and
deryck
be
co
ceo
okay
if
you
re
go
to
i
can
t
stop
you
dimon
reply
you
re
the
bos
but
i
think
it
s
wrong
sandy
didn
t
immediately
tell
maughan
of
his
decision
before
he
do
that
he
want

couldn
t
quite
settle
on
a
figure

be
close
enough
that
sandy

maughan
what
do
you
want
to

sandy
ask
him
you
should
just

in
a

apart
from
the

be
significant
collins
told

real
progress
couldn
t
occur
until
reed
who
be
on
his
way
to
asia
have
time
to
evaluate
the
proposition
more
thoughtfully
because
reed
like
to
put
his
thought
down
on
paper
test
the
logic
of
proposition
to
see
if
they

calculate
that
would

on
the

almost
entirely

on
the
notion
that
this
wouldn

be
a
takeover

the

but
rather
a
merger
of

to

under
the
unique

the

make
it
impossible
for

that

at
the
list
of

on
the

side
traveler
director
arthur

often
joked

and
pronounce

as
very
august

and

immediately
conclude
that
the

brilliant
with

we
re
nervous
as

about

full
of

for

along

to
sell
his

on
the
extraordinary

between
the
two
company
the
combination
will
bring
such
power
in
the
marketplace
and
enhance
our
growth
prospect
sandy
told
them
the
reward
would
be
gigantic
the
question
then
be
whether
these
benefit
be
worth
the
risk
that
you
and
john

will
have
trouble

grant

the
approval
to
proceed
to

only
a

assemble
by
a
remarkably
tiny

one
reason
be
that
sandy

two
of
america

top
financier
knew
what
they
be

this

the

very
impressed
with

that
would

him
up
at

nominally
as
the
heir
apparent
to

and
reed
sandy
agree
but
pointedly
didn
t
offer
the
additional

hard
he
sense
that
deep
down
sandy
be
very
very
angry
with
him
he

notice
too
that
joan

seem
colder
toward
him
since
jessica

still
dimon
be
confident
that
his

would
soon
improve
after

the

between
the

sandy
and
the

set
the

very
personal
to
an

the

playfully
he

to
cut
to
the
chase
how
much
would
this

cost
how
would

bewilder
which

first
moreover
they
wonder
how
two
people
who
seem
so
out
of
touch
with
each
other
have
ever
work
out
the
complex
detail
that
brought

together
when
the
meeting

stingy
consistent
with

practice
of
slash

reduce

and
replace
them
with

generous
benefit
sandy
want
to
immediately
scale
back
citicorp

it
would
be
a
quick
way
to
achieve
cost
saving
and
show
the
world
how
much
more
efficient
the
merge
company
could
be
but
reed
refuse
to

rush
cite
a
moral
obligation
to
employee
reed
take
the
question
under
advisement
and
begin
one
of
his
excruciatingly
thorough
analysis
of
the
situation
four
month
later
after
what
he
told
colleague
be
zillion
of
hour
of
labor
reed
finally
agree
to
a
plan
that
rely
more
heavily
on
stock
option
and
less
on
direct
expenditure
from
citigroup
s
coffer
but
he
insist
that
it
wouldn
t
take
effect
until
the
year

decision
prompt
a
debate
about

an
enthusiastic
proponent
of

for
everyone
he
want
to
encourage
all
employee
to

sandy
s
zeal
for

he
fear
they
would
become
an
end
in
themselves
prompt
manager
to
quit
care
about
the

its

about

how
to
get

delighted
with
the

at

they

grapple
with

the
difference
in

painfully
obvious

her
longtime

as
she
learn

priority
and
idiosyncrasy
she
try

into
her

drew

calibrate
risk
he
want
to
focus
on
actual

he
understood
risk
in
his

with

early
in

reporting
to
john
and
sandy
in
the

room
at
the

time
require
do
a
split
brain
she
complain
to
bill
pike
the
investor
relation
executive
even
if
both
of
them
agree
i
have
to
convince
sandy
with
one
argument
and
john
with
a

it
s
impossible
to

confess
that
he
too
be
completely
frustrate
we

how
this

pan
out
john

then
miller
have
an
idea
rather
than
give
what
amount
to
two
different
presentation
simultaneously
why
not
suggest
that
she
would
brief
sandy
and
reed
separately
it
might
be
in
violation
of
the
merger
agreement
but
it
would
be
much
easy
for
her
to
make
a
logical
organize
presentation
to
each
of
the
two
co
ceo
she
could
spend
her
time
with
each
one
address
his
concern
and
not
waste
the
other
s
time
nervously
she
take
her
idea
to
the
two
boss
they
agree
so
hastily
and
enthusiastically
that
it
dawn
on
miller
they
really
don
t
like

in
the
same
room
together
still
the
citigroup

profess
that
their
partnership
be
thrive
perceive
conflict
be
just
part
of
the
adjustment
process
for
two

show
when

i
have
no
problem
be
a
partner
with
john

add
we
do
have
difference
of
temperament
but
they
work
out
pretty
easily
but
then
just
six
month
after

most
optimistic
estimate
at
the

stood
at
more
than
double
the

complete
in
october
the
customary
conference
call
with

analyst
present
a
perfect
opportunity
for
sandy

to
show
that
their
new
business
model
be
succeed
the
investor

set
up
the
conference
call
from
a
neutral
zone
a
conference
room
on
the

floor
rather
than
from
either
ceo
s
office
as
they
ushered
sandy

into
the
small
windowless
room
they
sense
trouble
both
men
seem
uncomfortable
rather
than
celebratory
certainly
sandy
wasn
t
happy
with
the
set
he
traditionally
conduct
conference
call
from
the
comfort
of
his
tufted
leather
couch
where
he
could
relax
and
banter
and
take
full
advantage
of
his
skill
in
answer
question
spontaneously
reed
clearly
didn
t
want
to
even
do
the
call
nevertheless
sandy
prepared
for
the
call
by
pore
over
the
number
and
fire
question
at
manager
he
want
to
be
fully
conversant
with
the
result
wall

should
love
these
earnings
he
enthuse
try
to
pump
up
his
partner
i
just
don
t
care
about
quarterly
earnings
reed
say
my
concern
be
what
the
company
be
make
five
year
from
now
increase
market
share
building
the
franchise
bill
pike
wince
quarterly
earnings
and
minute
by
minute
stock
quote
be
what
sandy
live
for
well
he
thought
to
himself
the
actual
call
will
go
well
than
this
once
the
analyst
be
all
connect
sandy
diplomatically
urge
reed
to
speak
first
the
longtime
banker
briefly
described
revenue
growth
the
effect
of
expense
control
and
the
company
s
return
on
equity
but
then
he
add
a
kicker
it
won
t
get
any
well
than
that
sandy
acutely
attune
to
wall
street
s
perception
move
quickly
to
counter
reed
s
pessimistic
outlook
we
make
more
money
than
any
company
this
quarter
he
crow
and
we
re
just
get
start
as
the
conference

continued
sandy

go
back
and
forth
almost
as

the
benefit
of

interject
yes

diametrically
oppose
to
the

s
to
the

they
sound
disjoint
and
inconsistent
unable
to
articulate
a
comprehensive
strategy
or
even
a

when
the

impressed
alwaleed
didn
t
ask
sandy
directly
about
his
relationship
with

he
simply
express
his
concern
that
just
the
perception
of
tension

would
have
a
negative

alwaleed
acknowledge
that
two
high
gear
high
power

would
have
difference
and
he
encourage
sandy
to
continue
his
relentless
focus
on
the
business
separately
the
prince
met
with

s
closest
confidant
vice
chairman
paul
collins
to
discus
the
tension
between
sandy

and
urge
the

to
correct
the
perception
of
friction
between
them
separate
but
equal
citigroup
s
senior
executive
knew
however
that
the
friction
wasn
t
just
a
perception
it
be
very
real
when
be
this
place
go
to
blow
up
bill
campbell
ask
bob
lipp
campbell
and
lipp
co
ceo
of
the
consumer
banking
side
of
citigroup
have
be
get
along
very
well
mostly
because
they
stayed
out
of
each
other
s
way
campbell
as
a
former
philip
morris
head
didn
t
interfere
with
banking
operation
focus
only
on
marketing
and
image
lipp
who
didn
t
like
to
spend
money
on
advertising
left
campbell
free
to
pursue
his
interest
maybe
they
should
divide
up
responsibility
like
we
do
lipp
speculate
spur
by
prince
alwaleed
s
warn
that
be
exactly
what
sandy
be
think
he
propose
to
reed
that
he
and
his
fellow
co
ceo
follow
the
example
set
by
lipp
and
campbell
separate
but
equal
responsibility
under
his
plan
sandy
would
manage
all
financial
and
business
operation
the
profit
center
that
make
money
reed
would
oversee
the
technology
legal
and
personnel
department
the
area
that
cost
money
the
proposal
clearly
played
to
each
man
s
strength
and
interest
the
co
ceo
brought
their
idea
to
citigroup
s
board
at
its
mid
july
meeting
they
told
the
director
that
the
behemoth
they
be
charge
with
run
be
simply
too
big
and
complicate
for
them
to
be
make
every
decision
jointly
the
process
be
cumbersome
and
inefficient
everything
would
run
more
smoothly
if
they
divide
power
the
space
we
will
give
each
other
will
be
good
for
both
of
us
sandy
say
the
director
weren
t
surprised
that
the
joint
decision
make
foreseen
in
the
merger
agreement
wasn
t
work
none
of
them
have
expect
it
to
be
efficient
or
to
last
very
long
but
they
be
shock
at
the
way
the
two
co
ceo
be
propose
to
divide
their
power
it
be
certainly
separate
but
it
be
far
from
equal
the
original
citicorp
director
couldn
t
believe
that
reed
be
voluntarily
cede
so
much
authority
to
the
ex
traveler
chief
frank
thomas
a
citi
board
member
who
have
be
the
president
of
the
ford
foundation
ask
reed
pointedly
john
be
you
sure
you
want
to
do
this
his
question
be
echoed
by
one
of

most
devote
backer
edgar
woolard
be
you
sure
you
will
be
happy
with
this
i

happy
with

the

to
do
you
realize
how
much

he
ask

nod
with

assurance
that
the
power

arrangement
be
what
he
want
the

warily
give
their
blessing
while
citigroup
have
just
report
another
record
profit
for
the
second
quarter
the
director
knew
that
if
the
old
system
of
power

continued
it
would
eventually
hurt
the
company
on
july
sandy
and
reed
co
sign
an
internal
memorandum
to
senior

the

we
no
longer
feel
the
need
to
attend
every
meeting
together
or
read
all
the
same
memo
they
write
instead
we
can
well
divide
the
job
of
lead
this
great
company
and
simplify
the
decision
make
process
the
memo
continued
after
several
month
work
side
by
side
we
feel
we
know
each
other
well
know
the
company
well
and
instinctively
rely
on
each

judgment

the

the

easily

s
large
financial
empire
while
john

about
it
still
if
this
be
what
it
take
to
keep
the

on
course
then
that
be
fine
but
the
truce
didn
t
last
long
the
next
clash
between
sandy
and
reed
come
over
what
role
the
internet
would
play
in
citigroup
s
strategy
it
be
a
debate
about
the
future
not
only
of
citigroup
but
also
of
their
own
career
john

the
undisputed
visionary
of

word
by
put
them
on

despite
the
huge
capital
outlay

now
he
want
to
make
the

dramatic
push
into
online
territory
with
internet
base
financial
service
a
few
year
earlier
reed
have

around
the

via

reed
a
true
believer
in
the
power
of
technology
be
willing
to
devote
whatever
resource
necessary
to
continue
his
track
record
of
technological
innovation
but
sandy
wasn
t
buying
into
the
internet
or
the
technology
stock
boom
he
didn
t
know
how
to
turn
on
his
computer
much
less
send
an
e
mail
or
execute
a
stock
trade
electronically
and
value
conscious
investor
that
he
be
he
be
acutely
suspicious
of
the
skyrocket
value
of
technology
stock
particularly
the
start
ups
with
no
product
no
track
record
and
no

the
internet
boom
be
be
built
by
free
work
capital
he
warn
horowitz
people
can
just
go
public
and
get
capital
without
pay
for
it
obviously
that
can
t
last
when
sandy
look
at
e
citi
he
didn
t
see
the
future
all
he
saw
be
red
a
deep
hole
that
already
have
consume
million
and
have
little
to
show
for
it
he
be
particularly
irritated
that
reed
have
designate
e
citi
a
think
tank
that
effectively
isolated
it
from
the
business
unit
that
would
require
it
to
produce
fast
and
profitable
result
e
citi
become
the
focal
point
of
disagreement
between
sandy
and
reed
about
how
the
entire
empire
should
be
run
sandy
complain
to
old
friend
on
the
citigroup
board
that
reed
wasn
t
abide
by
the
new
power
share
arrangement
john
still
show
up
at
meeting
and
slows
down
decision
he
say
still
with
the
majority
of
top
level
job
held
by
sandy
s
loyalist
he
continued
to
try
to
run
the
company
his
way
reed
mount
his
own
attack
on
sandy
but
he
do
so
indirectly
after
ask
andrall
pearson
one
of
citigroup
s
director
for
a
meeting
ostensibly
to
discus
citigroup
s
future
reed
journeyed
to
greenwich
connecticut
to
meet
pearson
in
his
office
although
he
have
originally
be
a
member
of
traveler
board
pearson
have
never
be
particularly
friendly
with
sandy
he
could
be
openly
skeptical
of
sandy
s
idea
and
he
frequently
ask
stern
question
at
board
meeting
also
pearson
remain
friendly
with
jamie
dimon
if
reed
be
go
to
sway
a
traveler
director
against
sandy
pearson
would
be
the
logical
choice
when
pearson
greet
him
reed
say
i
want
to
get
to
know
the
director
from
the
traveler
side
but
as
soon
as
they
be
seat
in
pearson
s
corner
office
the
get
acquaint
meeting
turn
into
a
get
sandy
session
he
doesn
t
know
anything
about
the
internet
reed
complain
he
doesn
t
know
anything
about
banking
and
really
he
doesn
t
know
anything
about
run
a
global
business
well
that
s
not
good
pearson
say
startle
at
the
sudden
attack
on
sandy
what
s
he
good
at
sandy
s
a
detail
guy
reed
answer
he
know
all
the
number
but
can
t
articulate
a
strategy
as
a
director
of
sandy
s
burgeon
empire
for
thirteen
year
pearson
agree
with
that
assessment
he
can
t
consciously
tell
you
what
the
hell
he
s
do
he
told
reed
still
you
follow
sandy
because
he
tell
you
it
s
go
to
be
good
and
it
s
good
pearson
be
impressed
with
reed
s
dissection
of
sandy
s
fault
he
want
to
know
more
about
the
grow
conflict
between
the
two
co
ceo
over
technology
a
hot
topic
among
executive
all
over
the
country
the
banking
business
could
easily
be
branchless
reed
say
we
re
behind
sandy
won
t
invest
in
the
future
because
he
s
so
worried
about
this
quarter
s
earnings
when
reed
left
pearson
ponder
what
have
just
happen
john
just
try
to
kill
sandy
with
me
he
realize
the
conflict
at
the
top
be
bad
than
any
of
us
thought
within
day
pearson
begin
get
phone
call
from
reed
loyalist
on
the
citigroup
board
sandy
isn
t
up
to
the
job
one
director
told
pearson
he
ll
be
a
disaster
if
we
let
him
have
control
of
the
company
say
another
by
the
time
of
the
fall
board
meeting
every
director
as
well
as
sandy
and
reed
knew
that
the
infighting
and
backbiting
have
become
intense
they
have
all
know
from
the
begin
that
the
two
co
ceo
be
polar
opposite
in
so
many
respect
but
sandy
and
reed
have
work
hard
in
the
early
stage
of
the
merger
to
keep
those
difference
hidden
or
at
least
under
control
now
just
how
strongly
each
man
felt
about
his
approach
to
run
the
company
be
out
in
the
open
the
director
assemble
for
their
customary
board
dinner
the
night
before
the
meeting
in
a
private
din
room
at
le
cirque
one
of
sandy
s
favorite
restaurant
no
one
say
a
word
about
all
the
lobbying
and
attack
of
the
recent
week
but
when
pearson
left
the
room
to
go
to
the
bathroom
edgar
woolard
an
original
citicorp
director
and
former
chairman
and
ceo
of
dupont
hurry
after
him
the
word
be
obviously
out
that
pearson
could
be
the
swing
vote
in
any
showdown
between
the
two
co
ceo
you
have
to
do
something
about
this
woolard
say
it
s
get
out
of
hand
i
agree
say
pearson
and
continued
on
his
way
the
next
morning
the
director
gather
in
the
citigroup
boardroom
despite
the
reorganization
of
their
duty
reed
and
sandy
acknowledge
their
partnership
wasn
t
work
the
co
ceo
diplomatically
ask
the
director
for
their
idea
on
what
to
do
each
board
member
offer
suggestion
maybe
they
should
change
the
organization
again
or
perhaps
reduce
the
number
of
two
head
monster
under
sandy
and
reed
maybe
more
one
on
one
meeting
between
sandy
and
reed
would
smooth
thing
out
when
it
be
pearson
s
turn
to
speak
he
thought
for
a
moment
about
what
hadn
t
already
be
say
and
decide
to
plow
ahead
this
be
all
bullshit
he
told
his
fellow
director
their
various
idea
he
say
would
work
under
normal
circumstance
but
this
be
an
extraordinary
situation
he
have
everyone
s
rapt
attention
he
look
at
the
co
ceo
sandy
and
john
we
can
reorganize
this
business
until
hell
freeze
over
and
it
won
t
fix
it
the
main
problem
be
that
the
two
of
you
guy
don
t
agree
on
one
single
thing
about
how
to
run
this
company
holy
christ
one
of
you
like
salary
the
other
stock
one
of
you
be
formal
the
other
do
nothing
formal
one
be
into
process
the
other
guy
hate
process
unless
the
two
of
you
can
just
sit
down
with
the
six
or
eight
fundamental
notion
of
how
to
run
this
business
and
say
i
can
buy
this
point
of
view
you
ll
never
be
able
to
get
along
no
one
say
a
word
as
pearson
s
comment
sank
in
then
another
director
suggest
a
break
as
they
rise
john
deutch
a
longtime
citicorp
director
and
former
chief
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
told
pearson
it
s
what
need
to
be
say
no
one
would
be
frank
after
most
of
the
director
have
left
the
room
reed
come
up
to
pearson
that
really
be
a
remarkable
perceptive
conclusion
that
s
exactly
the
problem
we
have
yet
despite
pearson
s
forceful
comment
the
board
meeting
conclude
without
reach
a
solution
neither
of
the
co

volunteer
to
bend
in
the
other
s
direction
sandy
and

be
at
a
complete
impasse

what
i
know
now
i
wouldn
t
have
aid
and
abet
sandy
in
get
rid
of
jamie
he
would
be
the
logical
successor
reed
say
if
i
have
know
jamie
well
at
the
time
all
this
happen
i
think
i
could
have
save
him
the
director
look
at
one
another
nearly
all
of
them
have
like
and
admire
dimon
but
follow
the
will
of
the
co
ceo
now
one
of
them
be
say
it
be
a
mistake
but
pearson
watch
silently
on
the
videophone
didn
t
think
reed
should
be
so
quick
to
wash
his
hand
of
dimon
s
dismissal
it
doesn
t
take
long
with
dimon
to
realize
how
talented
he
be
pearson
thought
to
himself
reed
however
propose
that
a
completely
new
ceo
might
be
well
anyway
i
feel
strongly
we
should
bring
in
a
successor
from
the
outside
who
would
be
neither
of
citi
or
traveler
who
could
put
the
company
together
without
any
historic
record
or
loyalty
he
say
he
toss
out
the
name
of
philip
purcell
the
chief
executive
officer
and
john
mack
the
chief
operating
officer
both
of
morgan
stanley
dean
witter
co
as
possible
candidate
he
suggest
the
board
form
a
special
committee
to
get
a
successor
in
place
and
operating
within
a
year
then
reed
take
his
shot
at
sandy
albeit
in
the
course
of
explain
what
an
ideal
chief
executive
would
posse
i
believe
the
objective
of
a
manager
be
evolutionary
success
not
maximize
shareholder
value
or
pricing
your
stock
or
profit
or
market
share
reed
say
do
you
plant
the
seed
for
the
future
of
the
company
or
do
you
just
exploit
your
current
opportunity
and
you
re
exhaust
at
the
finish
line
finally
reed
left
the
board
with
a
thought
about
his
and
sandy
s
original
agreement
to
merge
we
agree
after
a
period
of
time
we
would
leave
for
the
good
of
the
combine
company
the
time
have
come
the
very
point
that
have
become
an
issue
on
the
night
before
the
deal
be
announce
whether
the
two
co
ceo
would
walk
off
into
the
sunset
together
be
still
firmly
in
reed
s
mind
and
he
hop
the
board
would
also
remember
how
sandy
lead
them
to
believe
he
would
leave
with
his
co
chief
then
sandy
be
ushered
in
to
the
boardroom
his
proposal
be
straightforward
make
him
the
sole
chief
executive
what
i
think
need
to
be
do
be
for
one
person
to
take
over
sandy
say
i
think
it
might
well
be
me
sandy
be
be
diplomatic
every
director
in
the
room
knew
sandy
desperately
want
the
job
as
one
director
have
joked
he
need
to
run
citigroup
like
you
and
i
need
to
breathe
still
sandy
laid
out
his
case
for
a
single
leader
cogently
and
concisely
even
though
he
have
be
criticize
in
the
past
for
his
limited
vocabulary
on
this
day
his
direct
and
statesman
like
approach
help
his
cause
there
s
still
too
much
to
do
sandy
conclude
i
m
ready
to
do
it
i
m
not
ready
to
retire
there
be
his
counterpunch
at
reed
the
director
then
want
to
speak
with
rubin
who
have
be
ask
to
leave
because
he
be
an
inside
director
every
board
member
respect
the
former
treasury
secretary
even
though
he
have
make
no
effort
whatsoever
to
be
more
than
an
advisor
at
citigroup
naturally
the
director
ask
if
he
would
take
the
top
job
i
will
not
be
ceo
rubin
say
definitively
what
would
you
do
in
our
shoe
one
director
follow
up
if
they
could
work
it
out
that
s
the
best
solution
say
rubin
they
complement
each
other
with
such
different
skill
set
he
note
that
he
and
stephen
friedman
successfully
split
the
high
job
at
goldman
sachs
between
and
the
bad
solution
be
for
both
of
them
to
leave
rubin
say
call
that
scenario
nonsensical
the
director
then
pose
to
rubin
the
same
question
he
have
be
ask
citi
executive
in
recent
week
if
he
have
to
choose
one
man
who
would
it
be
the
most
sensible
solution
be
sandy
rubin
answer
the
group
that
report
to
sandy
be
the
best
management
team
i
ve
see
in
my
business
career
that
impressed
several
director
because
rubin
have
see
some
very
able
and
experienced
manager
in
his
year
on
wall
street
then
rubin
be
go
and
the
director
be
left
to
make
their
decision
sandy
reed
or
someone
entirely
new
without
their
cochairmen
they
chose
franklin
thomas
to
lead
the
discussion
a
lawyer
and
star
ivy
league
basketball
player
the
sixty
six
year
old
be
the
retire
president
of
the
ford
foundation
the
first
black
to
head
a
major
philanthropic
institution
as
the
director
begin
their
deliberation
sandy
reed
rubin
and
prince
settle
in
for
what
they
expect
would
be
a
few
hour
of
wait
in
the
four
oversized
armchair
outside
the
boardroom
the
men
begin
reading
the
sunday
newspaper
when
noon
pass
club
sandwich
be
brought
in
every
so
often
a
director
would
walk
past
the
foursome
in
the
wait
area
and
simply
nod
on
the
way
to
the
bathroom
inside
the
boardroom
the
director
take
turn
express
their
reaction
to
the
unwelcome
ultimatum
give
them
by
their
co
ceo
the
opinion
quickly
divide
between
the
original
citicorp
director
and
the
original
traveler
director
it
become
clear
that
each
side
be
stick
with
his
favor
ceo
s
proposal
if
a
vote
be
take
reed
would
win
eight
to
seven
zankel
fully
aware
of
the
likely
outcome
of
a
vote
urge
that
rubin
be
ask
to
rejoin
the
deliberation
at
least
the
vote
would
be
tie
zankel
thought
but
edgar
woolard
the
ex
chairman
and
ceo
of
dupont
steadfastly
refuse
woolard
be
no
stranger
to
boardroom
hot
seat
he
have
be
on
the
ibm
board
when
it
replace
john
akers
with
louis
gerstner
rubin
be
a
director
zankel
fought
back
he
should
have
a
vote
woolard
disagreed
because
rubin
as
a
company
employee
be
an
inside
director
at
this
juncture
it
become
obvious
to
pearson
sit
in
front
of
a
television
camera
in
singapore
that
the
citi
director
be
prepared
to
support
reed
s
proposal
that
the
co
ceo
leave
together
he
lean
into
his
microphone
and
get
the
board
s
attention
if
we
take
a
vote
it
look
pretty
clear
it
s
go
to
be
eight
to
seven
for
both
to
leave
i
think
that
will
be
a
disaster
for
the
company
the
tricon
chairman
say
two
year
ago
either
man
would
have
make
anybody
s
all
star
list
to
get
rid
of
the
two
of
them
and
hope
for
somebody
well
be
crazy
even
the
citicorp
director
listen
carefully
to
pearson
whom
they
regard
as
shrewd
and
elite
much
like
themselves
so
here
s
what
i
think
pearson
begin
number
one
we
can
t
go
on
the
way
we
be
number
two
we
need
to
pick
one
of
these
two
guy
and
number
three
i
think
it
ought
to
be
sandy
then
pearson
fire
off
three
reason
for
make
sandy
the
sole
ceo
he
want
the
job
all
but
one
of
the
executive
reporting
to
him
be
a
sandy
person
and
he
brings
more
to
the
party
in
term
of
leadership
skill
but
a
citicorp
director
quickly
disagreed
about
hand
over
the
rein
to
sandy
if
we
leave
sandy
as
the
sole
ceo
it
would
look
like
traveler
bought
citicorp
then
people
would
say
sandy
end
up
with
the
business
who
give
a
damn
zankel
blurt
out
the
reputation
of
both
john
and
sandy
will
be
preserve
if
they
both
leave
together
another
reed
loyalist
add
the
more
gracious
solution
be
for
them
to
retire
at
the
same
time
that
s
outrageous
zankel
sputter
you
re
put
the
interest
of
these
two
men
before
the
interest
of
the
shareholder
throw
out
both
guy
be
not
in
the
interest
of
million
of
shareholder
at
this
point
zankel
one
of
sandy
s
closest
friend
knew
he
be
fight
for
sandy
s
corporate
life
but
that
wasn
t
what
really
matter
he
be
really
fight
for
the
shareholder
the
people
for
whom
sandy
have
spent
his
own
life
fight
it
s
risky
enough
to
have
an
incomplete
merger
but
bring
in
a
new
man
be
a
risk
that
doesn
t
need
to
be
take
zankel
continued
we
have
a
competent
leader
before
us
he
have
a
real
record
the
hour
drag
by

to
do
with
succession
i
m
surprised
willumstad
reply
note
to
himself
that
sandy
s
sentence
contain
no
punctuation
separate
the
offer
from
the
matter
of
succession
the
succession
issue
clearly
be
not
under
discussion
really
why
sandy
ask
i
didn
t
think
you
be
prepared
to
do
this
with
me
or
anybody
else
the
tall
unassuming
executive
say
since
dimon
s
ouster
sandy
hadn
t
name
anyone
to
the
position
of
president
they
talk
a
few
minute
about
the
additional
duty
willumstad
would
assume
as
he
carefully
weigh
the
post
do
you
accept
sandy
push
well
i
guess
so
willumstad
answer
tentatively
willumstad
spent
the
weekend
ponder
the
role
he
be
be
ask
to
take
at
citigroup
perhaps
it
be
a
big
job
than
he
be
ready
to
take
on
and
why
be
sandy
do
this
now
a
year
earlier
when
bob
lipp
begin
talk
about
retirement
he
be
clearly
hint
that
he
want
to
be
name
president
but
sandy
have
let
him
retire
without
even
broaching
the
question
and
lipp
and
sandy
be
a
lot
closer
than
sandy
and
i
be
willumstad
thought
it
just
seem
weird
that
sandy
would
name
me
president
when
he
wouldn
t
give
lipp
the
title
on
monday
willumstad
call
sandy
to
say
he
need
to
talk
some
more
about
the
job
what
s
the
matter
sandy
ask
let
s
talk
about
what
this
mean
willumstad
reply
sandy
quickly
rearrange
his
schedule
to
have
lunch
with
willumstad
that
day
in
his
private
din
room
at
citigroup
headquarters
the
fifty
six
year
old
banker
who
have
left
chemical
bank
to
join
sandy
at
commercial
credit
year
earlier
be
a
standout
in
sandy
s
management
rank
consumer
banking
have
put
in
an
impressive
performance
in
a
bad
economy
sandy
respect
willumstad
s
fervor
and
finesse
at
cut
cost
as
well
as
his
masterly
ability
to
integrate
new
operation
from
citi
card
to
associate
branch
i
would
really
like
to
know
the
context
in
which
you
make
this
decision
willumstad
begin
at
lunch
i
know
you
say
this
have
nothing
to
do
with
succession
but
do
you
have
a
time
frame
in
your
mind
as
to
how
much
longer
you
re
go
to
be
around
there
it
be
again
the
hat
question
well
some
day
i
think
i
won
t
be
here
much
longer
sandy
say
evasively
other
time
i
have
no
intention
of
retire
i
m
not
ask
to
be
the
successor
willumstad
clarify
but
clearly
become
president
have
some
meaning
to
the
outside
world
and
the
rest
of
the
organization
and
i
don
t
know
whether
i
ever
would
want
your
job
that
s
no
problem
sandy
grin
i
m
not
offering
it
to
you
but
at
some
point
in
time
you
ll
leave
willumstad
try
again
to
pin
sandy
down
he
be
still
grapple
with
why
sandy
want
him
to
be
president
and
why
now
maughan
be
no
longer
in
the
doghouse
and
mike
carpenter
be
run
salomon
smith
barney
at
a
profit
outsider
consider
them
to
be
much
more
likely
to
inherit
sandy
s
mantle
and
willumstad
knew
it
i
don
t
know
what
i
would
do
if
i
retire
sandy
say
reveal
his
unwillingness
to
give
up
his
corporate
identity
what
be
i
go
to
do
i
can
t
play
golf
every
day
but
if
you
have
some
point
in
time
in
the
next
year
or
two
you
intend
to
leave
and
you
thought
i
might
be
a
candidate
for
your
job
you
probably
should
not
give
me
this
title
willumstad
say
i
m
not
go
to
be
out
of
here
that
soon
sandy
say
still
evasive
but
clearly
pleased
that
his
choice
for
president
wasn
t
breathing
down
his
neck
to
take
his
place
i
just
want
some
help
run
this
place
it
s
a
big
company
and
we
could
do
well
do
this
make
sense
for
the
organization
willumstad
ask
be
you
sure
i
m
the
right
person
there
be
just
so
many
different
piece
in
the
business
don
t
worry
about
it
sandy
assure
him
in
six
month
you
ll
feel
differently
finally
willumstad
who
have
never
finish
college
but
have
methodically
propel
consumer
banking
to
account
for
more
than
half
of
the
citigroup
s
profit
agree
to
become
president
this
be
a
big
deal
he
told
sandy
yes
it
be
sandy
agree
i
remember
when
i
be
told
i
would
be
president
of
american
express
i
couldn
t
wait
to
go
home
and
tell
joan
the
citigroup
board
approve
willumstad
as
president
although
some
concede
that
while
he
be
an
excellent
executive
he
didn
t
cut
a
very
high
profile
one
day
we
woke
up
and
willumstad
be
run
half
the
business
and
the
most
profitable
half
one
director
note
as
they
discuss
willumstad
s
qualification
other
director
wonder
if
willumstad
s
promotion
fulfil
the
letter
if
certainly
not
the
intent
of
sandy
s
promise
to
the
board
two
year
earlier
to
come
up
with
a
succession
plan
director
andrall
pearson
have
be
push
sandy
to
give
great
responsibility
to
his
executive
to
see
if
they
could
grow
to
become
successor
material
when
willumstad
s
appointment
be
announce
however
sandy
make
it
crystal
clear
that
he
wasn
t
anoint
anyone
if
i
be
name
an
heir
apparent
i
would
have
say
that
he
chide
reporter
the
new

time
headline
call
the
new
president
a
quiet
banker
in
a
big
shadow
insider
at
citi
generally
welcome
willumstad
s
new
role
because
his
personality
be
so
different
from
sandy
s
he
never
lose
his
temper
he
love
give
others
credit
and
he
didn
t
play
favorite
and
willumstad
could
be
fun
for
his
fifty
fifth
birthday
the
avid
snowboarder
and
elvis
presley
fan
don
an
elvis

and
flashy
jumpsuit
for
the
party
one
of
willumstad
s
first
big
assignment
as
president
come
as
a
surprise
he
be
to
help
sandy
the
grand
acquisitor
sell
one
of
citigroup
s
core
company
even
when
citigroup
have
be
do
well
amid
a
healthy
economy
sandy
hadn
t
be
happy
with
the
company
s
price
to
earnings
multiple
and
he
knew
the
source
of
the
problem
traveler
property
casualty
insurance
company
certainly
traveler
be
profitable
sandy
have
make
sure
of
that
when
he
take
it
over
back
in
but
within
citigroup
traveler
wasn
t
as
profitable
as
the
other
financial
service
unit
and
thus
it
become
a
drag
on
citigroup
s
profit
and
on
its
stock
price
it
would
have
to
go
sandy
have
devise
a
plan
to
cut
the
insurance
company
loose
in
a
spin
off
leave
citigroup
with
the
faster
grow
financial
business
underlie
sandy
s
move
be
the
realization
that
the
property
and
casualty
insurance
business
even
traveler
the
jewel
in
the
industry
wasn
t
a
good
cross
sell
with
banking
and
other
financial
service
citigroup
would
however
keep
the
small
part
of
traveler
its
life
and
annuity
business
because
the
banker
and
broker
have
be
successfully
sell
its
insurance
and
investment
product
to
their
client
sandy
have
chosen
the
right
time
to
sell
traveler
while
it
be
true
that
insurer

by
the
disastrous
loss
estimate
at
more
than
billion
associate
with
the
attack
on
the
twin
tower
it
be
also
true
that
they
have
take
those
onetime
loss
as
an
opportunity
to
hike
their
rate
sharply
and
those
hike
likely
would
remain
in
effect
for
year
to
come
the
prospect
of
a
prolong
period
of
high
revenue
have
persuade
investor
that
insurance
be
a
good
bet
and
stock
price
of

have
reach
dizzy
height
amid
an

sickly

plan

for
an
initial
public
offering
of
percent
of
traveler
to

the
rest
be
to
be
spun
off
to
citigroup
shareholder
to
do
with
as
they
pleased
and
sandy
have
just
the
guy
to
run
the
new
company
bob
lipp
have
already
confess
that
he
be
flunk
retirement
and
be
itch
to
be
back
in

of
something
lipp

the
drive
force
behind
traveler
turnaround
after
sandy
acquire
the
insurer
in
the
mid
s
he
be
delighted
when
sandy
ask
him
to
return
to
the
helm
but
the
delight
fade
fast
during
his
year
with
sandy

have
always
be
negotiate
alongside

with
his
backing
now
suddenly
he
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
it
wasn
t
a
pleasant
place
sandy
be
unmerciful
in
try
to
structure
the
transaction
for
citigroup
s
maximum
advantage
at
the
expense
of
the

critical
it
be

get
the

off
to
a

that
since

have
never

he
should
defer
to

the

of

willumstad
caught
between
his
close
friend
lipp
and
the
bos
who
have
just
make
him
president
often
reluctantly
step
in
to
mediate
eventually
the
financial
issue
be
settle
but
then
come
the
big
question
who
would
get
the
red
umbrella
each
man
want
the
beloved
logo
for
his
company
it
will
always
be
know
as
the
traveler
umbrella
lipp
argue
after
all
the
red
umbrella
have
be
part
of
traveler
advertising
since
the
insurance
company
s
beginning
in
the
s
even
twenty
year
from
now
it
will
be
the
traveler
umbrella
sandy
who
have
be
enamor
of
the
umbrella
since
take
over
traveler
in
vehemently
disagreed
now
it
mean
citigroup
sandy
retort
citigroup
have
slap
the
red
umbrella
on
every
single
entity
from
salomon
smith
barney
to
citibank
and
spent
million
of
dollar
on
advertising
signage
and
stationery
he
add
besides
i
ve
probably
invest
in
more
umbrella
clothes
than
all
the
people
up
there
put
together
sandy
say
refer
to
the
traveler
employee
in
hartford
that
may
have
be
true
especially
when
counting
sandy
s
dozen
of
expensive
herm
s
silk
tie
ultimately
lipp
accepted
the
loss
of
the
red
umbrella
as
the
price
for
traveler
independence
sandy
simply
be
not
go
to
give
up
the
cherished
icon
that
he
have
so
tightly
woven
into
citigroup
s
identity
and
his
own
emerge
victorious
from
the
traveler
sale
sandy
begin
to
think
that
really
would
be
a
well
year
for
him
and
citigroup
then
the
first
suggestion
that
it
might
not
emanate
from
an
unlikely
venue
tiny
augusta
georgia
the
national
council
of

orchestrate
a
push
to
force

club
to
admit
female
member
other
golf

indeed
all
sort
of

golf
tournament
each

be
a
high
profile
target
assure
the
woman

group
that
its
effort
would
get
plenty
of
publicity
sandy
have
take
special
delight
over
the
year
in

a
member
of
the

and
have
citigroup
among
the
major
sponsor
of

now
he
be
horrify
to
find
the

and
himself
the
focus
of
news
story
about
the
controversy
many
of
the
story
pose
exactly
the
question
that
the
woman

council
be
use
as
an
economic
lever
to
pry
open
the
club
s
membership
roll
how
can
the
chief
executive
officer
of

trade
company
that
supposedly
value
woman
employee
and
woman
client
belong
to

discriminatory
old
boy
club
or
use
their
company
money
to
support
its
tournament
at

sandy
try
to
abide
by
the
club
s
policy
that
member
be
forbidden
to
talk
about
the
club
the
club
itself
in
an
expensive
effort
to
squirm
out
of
the
issue
simply
drop
all
television
sponsor
for
the
tournament
give
the
immense
wealth
of
its
member
it
could
afford
to
ignore
the
kind
of
economic
pressure
the
woman
s
coalition
be
try
to
apply
but
economic
pressure
be
only
one
weapon
in
the
arsenal
of
the
national
council
of
woman
s
organization
it
wasn
t
nearly
as
effective
as
another
bad
publicity
suddenly
sandy
found
his
picture
flash

this
worried

have
grown
up
in
then
sandy
give
prince
another
shock
i
think
we
need
to
make
a
change
sandy
say
i
think
you
ought
to
be
the
person
to
go
down
and
run
the
business
why
do
you
think
that
the
fifty
two

ask
in

have
sandy
just
say
he

salomon
smith
barney
we
have
all
these

we
have

behind
him

want
to

why
someone
already
there
even
carpenter
couldn
t
offer
a
new
approach
that
include
reform
sought
by

it
s
hard
for
anybody
to
defend
what
they
ve
do
in
the
past
and
put
in
change
at
the

time
sandy

suggest
that
carpenter
be
more
interested
in
prove
he
and
his
team

i
believe
it
be
much
more
serious
for
the

assure
the

it

clear
in

harsh
light
of

that
there
have

as
head

make

discus
if
this
be
a
good
thing
to
do

andrall

it
s
unusual
for
a
guy
with
no
management
experience
in

to
take
on
a
job
like
this
several
director
quickly
echoed
that
their
main
concern
about
prince
be
his
lack
of
an
operation
track
record
at
the
same
time
they
agree
that
carpenter
should
be
replace
with
someone
from
the
inside
someone
who
knew
citigroup
thoroughly
who
be
well
respect
and
could
work
effectively
to
overcome
the
regulatory
and

hurdle
confront
the

believe

those
quality
be
bob

but
should
we
take
him
out
of
the
consumer
business
which
be
the
best
performer
right
now
one
director
ask
no
pearson
say
adamantly
you
have
to
focus
on
the
business
while
you
re
cleaning
all
this
stuff
up
if
the
business
go
down
the
tube
then
it
doesn
t
matter
too
goddamned
much
what
else
you
re
do
as
director
debate
the
notion
of

willumstad
pearson
try
again
to
convince
them
that
the
overall
business

willumstad
right
where
he

of

dryly
that
in

activity
anyway
one
phrase
in
the

surprising
to

insider
in
the
statement
sandy
say
although
we
have
found
nothing

look
back

way
we
believe
business
should
be
do
that

apologize
his

a
deep
seat
aversion
to
apology
whenever
he
blast
one
of
them
rightly
or
wrongly
he
never
apologize
later
instead
he
just
act
a
little
nicer
for
a
while
or
at
least
act
as
if
nothing
have
happen
others
worried
that
the
apology
be
premature
when
sandy
come
to
the

on
monday
an
executive
ask
him
point
blank
how
can
you
write

t
it
sound
like
we
re
concede
guilt
of
course
i

try
to
make
light
of
it
look

that

when

once
again
become

the
most
profitable
in

even
though
a
million
fine
might
look
bad
it
would
bring
sandy
s
most
difficult
crisis
to
a
close
and
the
cost
would
amount
to
a
measly
two

he
might
be

a
fact
that
virtually
anyone

be
well
aware
of

simply
didn

when
he
prod
grubman

take
a
fresh
look
at
at
t
sandy
add
i
always
believe
that
mr

would
conduct
his
own
research
and
reach
independent
conclusion
that
be
entirely
his
own
the

grill
behind
him
sandy
hastily
call
a

for
the
next
morning
as
the

assemble
they
discuss
among
themselves
the
grubman
memorandum
and
e

the
director
didn
t
need
any
reassurance
from
sandy
about
the
falsity
of
grubman
s
claim
that
the

have

nuke
john

they
knew

no

what
an

about

the

be
another

it
be
shape
up
as
a
public
relation
disaster
although
none
of
the
director
thought
sandy
have
act
unethically
and
certainly
not
illegally
this
be
nothing
to
cheer
about
concede
arthur

in
essence
grubman
get
a
million
bonus
but
the

get
some
great

with
the

other

acknowledge
that
they
have
make
call
at
the
behest
of
valuable
employee
and
even

charity
that
s
the
way
new

work
they
say
privately
fume
that
spitzer
be
stoke
his
political
ambition
at

expense
sandy
told
the
director
about
his
meeting
at
spitzer
s
office
the
day
before
he
characterize
it
as
a
polite
interrogation
then
he
warn
them
that
citigroup
would
have
to
persevere
in
the
face
of
continue
negative
medium
coverage
this
be
not
something
we
will
win
in
the

we
will
win
it
with
the
fact
he
told
them
this
be
horrendous
but
there
will
be
a
time
when
the
outcome
will
go
our
way

exclaim
with
disgust
the

express
shock
as
they
read
the

contain
sexual
content
that

suddenly
the

saw
grubman
s

braggadocio
and
his
recent
statement
disavow
it
in
a
new
light
so
grubman
have
be
preen
for
a
woman
one
board
member
conclude
it
become
painfully
apparent
that

have
pursue
a
personal
agenda
at

whether
to
impress

with

no

reflect
the

opinion
at
the
time
we
be
all
mislead
by

he
conclude
the
lawyer
warn
the
director
that
the
material
be
so
controversial
that
they
would
have
to

facedown
at
their

when
the

adjourn
as
the

drew
to
a
close
it
be
obvious
to
all
that
the

remain
solidly

recall
among

how
sandy
have
often

of

even
straight
as
an

chuck
prince
have
ask

to
put
in
a
good
word
at

for
his

the
