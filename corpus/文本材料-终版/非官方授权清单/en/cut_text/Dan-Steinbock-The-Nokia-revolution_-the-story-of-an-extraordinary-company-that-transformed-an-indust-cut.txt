nokia
a

that
have
stood
the
test

the

to
the

however
nokia

finland

enigma
for

finland
have
be
a
puzzle
even
to
most
european
it
be
in
europe

for
century
it
be
not

it

have

with

in

it

often
left
out
of

of
europe
it
be
consider
one
of
the
nordic
country
yet
it
be
not
part
of
scandi
navia
unlike
the
swedish
norwegian
and
danish
language
which
share
many
affinity
the
structure
of
finnish
and
its
several
dialect
be
different
the
geopolitical
history
of
finland
have
left
the
finn
far
more
open
to
international
influence
than
the
russian
yet
far
less
so
than
the
swede
unlike
the
russian
the
finn
have
not
embrace
authoritarian
ideology
rather
they
have
put
their
faith
in
egalitarian
ideal
like
the
german
the
finn
tend
to
respect
formal
title
and
authority
yet
the
national
hero
have
often
be
populist
or
individualistic
maverick
these
characteristic
be
reflect
in
nokia

well
fortune

quite
rightly

why
be
the

so
high
the
conventional
explanation
might
be
that
such
valuation
derive
in
part
from
nokia
exceptional
historical
performance

primarily
from
its

prospect
like

far
more
than

some
might

it

become
something

a

come
out

nowhere
to
challenge

in

yet
many
observer
knew
relatively
little
about
the

or
its
capability
thus
an
alternative
and
unorthodox
explanation
might
be
that
high
valuation
originate
at
least
in
part
from
the
expectation
that
its
past
triumph
would
ensure
its
future
success
not
from
knowledge
about

in

such

be
difficult
to

kairamo
say
in
until

have
be
forgotten
to
the
margin

even
though
we

a

not
enough

it

kairamo
could
neither
distance
himself
from
the
soviet

nor
approach
the

so
begin
his
quest
for
a
third

the
european

process
that
a
decade
or
two

the

have
the

determination
to
turn

in

that
goal
have

take

look

kairamo
later
recall
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
could
not
grow
in
finland
with
cable
or
tire
any
more
we
decide
to
keep
what
we
have
but
also
to
put
all
the
new
money
we
could
scrape
together
into
high

so
begin
the
story
that
ultimately
climaxed
in
nokia
position
as
a
world
power
in
mobile

from

the

however
many

not
to

the

consider
such

an

with

we
have
very
similar
idea
to
develop
nokia
thing
be
take
care
of
in
good
mutual
understand
we
have
achieve
a
lot
during
the
recent
few
year
last
year
growth
be
extraordinary
major
acquisition
in
west
germany
and
sweden
have
contribute
to
our
revenue
and
strengthen
our
position
in
europe
of
course
it
take
a
while
to
digest
two
significant
acquisition
the
close
timing
of
these
deal
be
partially
due
to
external
reason
still
we
have
already
get
far
in
the
technical
quality
practical
know
how
and
market
expertise
of
our
product
and
these
thing
will
ensure
our
success
in
the
future
as
well
few
believe
the

by
the

a

bold

acknowledge
to
the

that
nokia
miscalculate
the

need

integrate
the

but
he
also
insist
that
thing
be
turn
around
at
the
company
long
vacant
management
post
have
be
fill
the
company
have
take
the
first
step
toward

its

be
seek
a

for
its

subsidiary

that
would
provide
badly
need
fund
for

we
think
we
have
some
breathing
space
for
the
moment
say
one
anonymous
senior
executive
but
in
two
to
three
year
we
will
have
to
consider
divest
or
spin
off
at
least
one
and
maybe
two
of
the
electronics

to
raise

influential

for

the
wall

suspect
that
director
have
lose
confidence
in
vuorilehto
as
the
right
man
to
lead
nokia
out
of
its
current
difficulty
apparently
vuorilehto
have
lose
his
confidence
in
nokia
as
well
when
he
be
replace
with
ollila
he
sell
a
chunk
of
his
nokia
share
to
buy
a
yacht
when
the
share
price
go
through
the
roof
in
the
late
s
he
realize
he
have
give
up
a
fortune
i
have
the
world
most
expensive
yacht
he
acknowledge
the
sense
of
urgency
for
more
drastic
restructuring
grow
rapidly
and
nokia
continued
to
divest
itself
of
noncore
operation
such
idea
be
not
far
from
kouri

however
kouri

be
well
in

with

the

condemn
any

however
a

ahti

ollila
ollila
be
a
popular
candidate
among
many

because
he
appear
to
know
what
to
do
in
the

seem
intent

communicate

the

have
many
question
for

most
have
a
common
theme
can
nokia
be
save
ollila
in

present
his
argument
if
the
company
focus
on
mobile

opt
for

nokia
could
be
save
in

this
enable

rather
than
concern
himself
with
the
relationship
between

two
bank
nokia
owner
give
ollila
the
opportunity
to
move
ahead
without
interference
but
if
he
fail
to
turn
the
company
around
they
would
intervene
follow

you

ollila
would

the

by
have

concentrate
solely
on
the
wireless

perhaps
the
single
most
important
strategic
decision
in

these

that
would

from

the

be

with
the

since
the

some

show
a
great

and
furthermore
actual
strategy
make
be
the
function
of
the

the
objective
at

be
to
always

make
by
the
people

have
the
best

result
the

the

then
the

the
return
of
the
highly
centralize

structure

it

the

however
the

in

it

precipitate

many

also
stumble
with
some
of

at

initially
the

of

be
one
such
example
by

conclude

its

the
company
have
be
work
on
ip
switch

but
without
market
momentum
so
we
begin
to
look
for
an
acquirer
because
the

be
not
move
toward
a
direction
we
would
thought
acknowledge
ipsilon
tom

nokia
expect
the

to
strengthen
its

critic

have
waste

on

a

prove
to

something

it

why
then
do
the

the

ollila
do

we

in

the
realization
that

be
the

due
to
the

the

ollila
understood
the

if

held
the

to

the

not
only
be
this
insight
ahead
of

but
it
require
the

ollila
prescient

would
pertain

the

in
ollila
team
decide
that

a

anssi

to
figure
out
how

discover
a
common

among
brand
leader
such
as
nike
daimler

the
crucial
element
he
believe
be
a
holistic
approach
in
these
company
brand
be
not
a
side
effect
or
a
function

instead
these

thought
about
the

in
every
aspect
of
the

chain
include
design
production

in

to
the

these

treat

as
a
kind
of

they
get
around
to

only
when
all
the

be
in

the
insight
be
not
new
but
it
allow
vanjoki
to
shape
new
market
as
nokia
be
undergo
a
transformation
into
a

customer
commitment
process
and
management
control
and
hrm
process
in
brief
it
would
have
to
penetrate
the
entire
organization
branding
in
mobile
cellular
branding
have
be
research
for
decade
after
all
it
have
characterize
consumer
marketing
since
the
late
nineteenth
century
furthermore
by
the
late
s
branding
have
become
one
of
the
hottest
topic
in
strategic
management
as
nokia
cfo
in
the
late
s
ollila
have
see
how
in
the
course
of
the
m
as
company
paid
substantial
premium
for
brand
name
because
alternative
development
of
new
brand
name
be
either
not
feasible
or
simply
too
costly
second
in
many
industry
the
excessive
use
of
price
promotion
have
lead
to
increase
price
pressure
divert
resource
from
brand
building
to
develop
point
of
differentiation
finally
many
senior

have
not
fully
exploit
their
asset
in
particular
brand
equity
to
maximize
the
performance
of
their
business
there
be
little
new
in

the

itself
previously

also

far
more
than

it
be
branding
an
entire
company
while
nokia
success
in
the

be
almost
identical
with
the
triumph
of
the
gsm

which
the

be
about
to
launch
ollila

his

into

optimally
the

it

yet
what
on
the
surface
seem
like
an
extraordinary
bet
or
a
lucky
guess
follow
naturally
from
nokia
premise
to
always
listen
to
the
customer
in
anticipation
of
the

nokia

from

whether

that
require

nokia
invest
almost

pursue
a
global

strategy
nokia
have
systematically

nokia
do
not
consider

a
product
related
activity
only
in
effect
there
be
a
curious
linkage
between
recruiting

both

have
a
dual
objective
one

the
other
on

the
more
attractive
the

the
more
it
could
choose
from
those
who
select
the

as
ollila
expect

to
become
even
more
intense
and
commodity
like
in
the
near
future
nokia
rush
to
differentiate
itself
from
its
rival
essentially
people
behavior
do
not
differ
that
much
in
different
market
note
anssi
vanjoki
in
the
secret
be
in
the
ability
to
discover
the
global

as
such
it
be
easy
to
page
observe
local
difference
and
understand
the
basic
culture
but
it
be
difficult
to
observe
in
time
the
truly
global
megatrends
as
competitor
product
technology
and
quality
have
become
almost
homogeneous
brand
emerge
as
an
appropriate
base
of
differentiation
as
a
result
marketing
would
have
to
understand
human
behavior
in
product
function
and
design
who
buy
a

just
because
it
show

secondary
today
a

still
remains
a

in

the

will
be

not
by

it

an
inherent
part
of

strategic

its

when

they

threw

out
for
what

deem
industrial

not
before

have
see
enough
whether
the

be
true
or
just
another

be
irrelevant
through
the
persistent
determination

practical
ingenuity
of

mechelin
and
several
generation
of

chief

the

have
insist
against
all
odds
on
be
the

time
and
time
again
this
posture
have
meant
take
a
dive
into
the
unknown
and
the
willingness
to
cannibalize
the
company
current
source
of
success
in
the
name
of
a
future
opportunity
if
then
chance
be
a
poor
explanation
the
reduction
of
nokia
success
to
jorma
ollila
management
style
be
hardly
well
on
the
surface
it
may
be
tempt
to
believe
because
it
be
relatively
easy
to
periodize
the
evolution
of
a
give
company
on
the
basis
of
its
successive
chief
executive
the
problem
be
that
such
an
explanation
tell
everything
and
nothing
everything
because
now
the
management
style
of
the
corporate
leader
appear
to
penetrate
even
the
most
intricate
process
of
everyday
operation
and
nothing
because
in
practice
no
chief
executive
have
such
power
and
influence
furthermore
nokia
have
ridicule
all
such
effort
with
disdain
point
to
the
significance
of
teamwork
the
nature
of
the
process
organization
and
the
proliferation
of
cross
functional
activity
even
more
important
the
group
executive
board
half
a
dozen
highly
capable
senior
executive
rather
than
ollila
alone
have
developed
formulate
and
implement
nokia
strategy
since
the
early
s
certainly
ollila
have
take
responsibility
and
should
be
give
credit
for
the
crucial
strategic
decision
not
all
of
which
have
be
exactly
painless
especially
in
the
first
year
of
his
leadership
it
be
almost
impossible
to
understand
nokia
magnificent
success
at
the
end
of
the
twentieth
century
without
reference
to
ollila
role
in
its
strategy
when
ollila
become
nokia
ceo
and
chairman
in
his
power
at
least
formally
only
increase
yet
even
this
formal
designation
should
be
balance
against
the
scale
and
scope
of
the
change
company
in
when
ollila
be
appoint
nokia
ceo
nokia
revenue
be
about
billion
net
loss
amount
to
almost
million
and
it

by
its

have
soar
to
almost

income
be

and
it
have
more
than

at
that
time
ollila
be
already
delegate
responsibility
to
his
second
in
command
pekka
ala
pietil
if
neither
chance
nor
management
style
can
explain
nokia
success
perhaps
there
be
something
about
the
way
nokia
work
that
have
make
it
more
pragmatic
focus
and
flexible
than
other
company
even
this
explanation
however
do
not
lead
very
far
as
fortune
explain
it
be
the
way
the
organization
creates
a
meeting
of
mind
among
people
ollila
say
how
do
you
send
a
very
strong
signal
that
this
be
a
meritocracy
and
this
be
a
place
where
you
be
allow
to
have
a
bit
of
fun
to
think
unlike
the
norm
where
you
be
allow
to
make
a
mistake
yes
this
sound
kind
of
squishy
and
vague
and
it
may
seem
a
slender
reed
upon
which
to
balance
billion
in
market
cap
but
spend
time
around
nokia
ask
what
have
make
the
company
so
successful
and
it
be
as
definite
an
answer
as
you
will

not
that
people
who
work
at
