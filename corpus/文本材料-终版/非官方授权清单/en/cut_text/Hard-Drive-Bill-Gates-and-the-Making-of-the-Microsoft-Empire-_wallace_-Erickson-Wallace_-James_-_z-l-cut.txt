the
smart
one
bill

be
the
shy
one
despite
her
volunteer
activity
and
community
involvement
that
kept
her
busy
mary
gate
be
a
devote
mother
she
also
love
to
socialize
and
she
and
her
husband
threw
frequent
party
for
their

who
include
many
of

wealthy
and
most
powerful
individual
a
charm
gracious

warm
and
outgo
she
could
nonetheless
be
quite
assertive
with
a
steely
gaze
and
a
firm
handshake
she
be
very
much
the
kind
of
person
who
size
you
up
make
quick
conversation
and
move
along
exit
gracefully
but
forcefully
a
business
friend
say
as
successful
as
the
gregarious
mary
gate
be
in
seattle
s
community
the
quieter
bill
jr
also
become
a
respect
figure
his
legal
career
be
further
by
his
relationship
through
marriage
to
the
maxwell
he
be
active
in
the
bar
eventually
serve
as
president
of
the
washington
state
bar
association
and
chair
several
american
bar
association
commission
in
he
become
a
senior
partner
in
the
law
firm
of
shidler
mcbroom
gate
lucas
a
firm
root
in
republican
politics
my
sense
be
that
bill
jr
always
want
to
position
himself
to
exert
quiet
control
in
the
law
firm
and
mary
be
more
inclined
to
pull
public
string
and
press
the
switch
say
one
seattle
attorney
who
know
the
family
both
mary
and
bill
jr
become
active
in
republican
party
circle
as
well
although
they
kept
in
the
political
shadow
and
out
of
the
public
eye
in
governor
evans
a
family
friend
quietly
push
to
have
gate
nominate
to
a
federal
judgeship
in
seattle
but
the
state
s
two
u
s
senator
at
the
time
henry
scoop
jackson
and
warren
magnuson
both
democrat
prefer
a
local
attorney
with
more
liberal
leaning
to
fill
the
vacancy
on
the
federal
bench
in
local
politics
bill
jr
refuse
to
make
personal
appearance
for
candidate
or
do
anything
that
might
draw
public
attention
to
his
political
belief
nonetheless
his
belief
be
rock
solid
when
a
lawyer
seek
re
election
as
a
democrat
to
the
state
legislature
call
on
him
to
ask
him
for
a

endorsement
and
financial
contribution
he
reply
jesus
i

never
give

bill

be
a
hard
man
difficult

trey

alternative
side
he
be
the
kind
of
teacher
who
would
show
up
for
his
class
in
a
gorilla
suit
to
illustrate
a
point
and
whose

include

fulghum
knew
gate
fairly
well
although
the

be
never

any
of
his
art
class
lakeside
always
drew
on
the
city

big
money
establishment
many
of
the
boy
who
have
pass
through
the
school
over
the
year
be
the
mover
and
shaker
of
the
community
it
be
a
fiercely
competitive
environment
at
every
level
even
the
dumb
kid
be
smart
say
one
member
of
gate
graduate
class
of
among
the
student
at
lakeside
be
the
mccaw
brother
who
together
built
a
billion
dollar
cellular
phone
empire
although
the
school
reward
the
marcher
and
the
salu
ters
the
student
who
really
attract
attention
be
those
who
be
unusual
in
some
way
these
kid
get
a
lot
of
support
and
encouragement
from
the
administration
and
faculty
you
could
if
you
look
at
lakeside
superficially
think
of
it
as
an
elitist
school
with
high
requirement
and
strictly
focus
on
college
preparation
say
fulghum
but
in
fact
it
tend
to
look
very
very
carefully
at
individual
student
especially
one
who
stuck
out
in
any
direction
and
it
would
give
those
student
lot
and
lot
of
privilege
and
rope
and
space
to
do
whatever
they
could
do
even
if
it
be
far
out
of
the
usual
constraint
of
the
school
in
that
sense
lakeside
be
extraordinary
it
allow
student
to
develop
their
own
interest
and
gate
quickly
do
just
that
there
would
come
a
time
when
every
student
in
school
knew
his
name
knew
that
he
be
the
best
of
the
best
at
lakeside
but
the
only
thing
remarkable
about
bill
gate
when
he
begin
the
seventh
grade
be
his
big
foot
although
he
be
the
small
boy
in
the
seventh
grade
gate
wore
size
wingtips
we
all
wonder
if
he
would
grow
into
his
foot
a
classmate
recall
of
all
the
friendship
he
would
develop
at
lakeside
none
would
be
as
strong
or
as
close
as
his
friendship
with
kent
evans
the
two
be
inseparable
from
the
seventh
grade
both
be
gift
both
share
a
passion
for
mathematics
and
both
would
soon
share
an
even
great
passion
for
computer
gate
and
evans
have
very
different
personality
while
gate
could
be
cold
and
aloof
like
his
father
kent
be
warm
and
outgo
a
minister
s
son
with
a
harelip
and
thick
black
hair
there
be
a
down
to
earth
quality
to
evans
lakeside
student
would
remember
him
as
the
nice
boy
in
school
toward
the
end
of
gate
first
year
at
lakeside
in
the
early
spring
of
the
school
make
a
decision
that
would
prove
decisive
to
bill
gate
future
america
be
prepare
to
send
astronaut
to
the
moon
a
technological
feat
make
possible
by
the
development
of
the
computer
lakeside
have
decide
to
expose
its
student
to
this
new
and
excite
world
of
computer
the
question
be
how
to
buy
a
computer
on
a
school
budget
even
the
budget
of
a
well
to
do
private
school
the
giant
brain
mainframe
computer
of
the
day
cost
million
of
dollar
and
be
out
of
reach
bf
all
but
the
government
university
and
the
large
corporation
digital
equipment
corporation
well
know
as
dec
have
recently
begin
marketing
a
minicomputer
but
even
this
refrigerator
size
machine
be
out
of
reach
of
the
lakeside
budget
so
the
school
bought
itself
a
relatively
inexpensive
teletype
machine
for
a
fee
user
could
type
command
on
the
teletype
and
communicate
via
telephone
line
with
a
pdp
minicomputer
in
downtown
seattle
pdp
stand
for
program

the
pdp
one
in
a
series
of
very
famous
computer
built
by
digital

corporation
would
play
a
significant
role
in
gate
development
as
a
computer
programmer
the
pdp
lakeside
use
be
own
by
general
electric
which
bill
lakeside
for
computer
time
use
by
its
student
and
computer
time
be
very
costly
a
group
of
mother
the
lakeside
mother
club
held
a
rummage
sale
to
buy
computer
time
and
raise
about
figure
the
amount
would
be
enough
to
last
the
rest
of
the
school
year
what
they
didn
t
realize
be
how
seductive
a
mistress
the
machine
would
become
to
a
few
precocious
boy
who
like
math
and
science
bill
gate
and
evans
be
about
to
develop
a
very
expensive
addiction
lakeside
become
one
of
the
first
school
in
the
country
with
computer
capability
the
computer
room
soon
become
a
powerful
magnet
for
several
of
lakeside
s
brightest
student
especially
gate
before
long
the
teletype
would
be
his
umbilical
cord
to
a
new
and
excite
universe
gate
be
in
paul
stocklin
s
math
class
when
he
get
his
first
peek
at
the
computer
room
one
spring
day
stocklin
take
his
entire
math
class
over
to
the
upper
school
to
see
it
under
stocklin
s
supervision
gate
typed
in
a
few
instruction
and
watch
in
awe
as
the
teletype
after
communicate
with
the
pdp
several
mile
away
typed
back
the
response
it
be
well
than
science
fiction
i
knew
more
than
he
do
for
the
first
day
but
only
for
that
first
day
say
stocklin
who
now
chair
the
lakeside
math
department
we
be
really
wing
it
none
of
us
knew
anything
back
then
this
thing
wasn
t
like
a
macintosh
gate
be
immediately
hooked
whenever
he
have
free
time
he
would
run
over
to
the
upper
school
to
get
more
experience
on
the
system
but
gate
be
not
the
only
computer
craze
kid
at
lakeside
he
found
he
have
to
compete
for
time
on
the
computer
with
a
handful
of
others
who
be
similarly
drawn
to
the

as
if
by
a
powerful
gravitational
force
among
them
be
a
soft
spoken
upper

be
two
year
old

classmate
would
form
microsoft
the
most
successful

company
in
the

when
albert

be
four

old
and
sick
in

his
father
give
him
a
magnetic
pocket
compass
in
his
autobiographical
note
write
year
later
einstein
described
the
compass
as
a
wonder
it
may
well
have
determine
the
direction
of
his
life
as
a
theoretical
physicist
that
this

not
at
all
fit

he
write
i
can
still
remember
at

i
believe
i
can
still
remember
that
this
experience
make
a
deep
and
last
impression
on
me
bill
gate
undoubtedly
cannot
explain
why
he
react
as
he
do
to
his
own
wonder
the
computer
but
it
trigger
a
deep
passion
an
obsession
in
him
from
that
first
day
in
the
small
computer
room
at
lakeside
its
pull
on
him
be
inexorable
gate
devour
everything
he
could
get
his
hand
on
concern
computer
and
how
to
communicate
with
them
often
teach
himself
as
he
go
the
faculty
knew
next
to
nothing
about
computer
gate
and
the
other
kid
hang
out
day
and
night
in
the
computer
room
be
pretty
much
on
their
own
we
be
off
in
our
own
world
gate
recall
later
nobody
quite
understood
the
thing
but
us
i
want
to
figure
out
exactly
what
it
could
do
this
insatiable
appetite
for
computer
time
be
very
expensive
within
week
most
of
the
raise
by
the
mother
club
be
go
eventually
parent
be
ask
to
help
pay

he
then
write
a
program
for
a

game
which
require
the

to
make
a

before
expend
all
fuel
in
the

and
crash
on

this

would
prove

prophetic
the

it
be
developed
by
two
dartmouth
college
professor
in
under
a
grant
from
the
national
science
foundation
to
teach

interested

the
strange

in
which
one
communicate

use
only
two
word
usually
designate
zero
and
one
gate
talk
about
this
relationship
between
computer
and
mathematics
in
the
book
programmer
at
work
by
susan
lammers
most
great
programmer
have
some
mathematical
background
because
it
help
to
have
study
the
purity
of
prove
theorem
where
you
don
t
make
soft
statement
you
only
make
precise
statement
in
mathematics
you
develop
complete
characterization
and
you
have
to
combine
theorem
in
very
nonobvious
way
you
often
have
to
prove
that
a
problem
can
be
solve
in
less
time
math
relates
very
directly
to
program
maybe
more
so
in
my
mind
than
in
other
people
s
mind
because
that
s
the
angle
that
i
come
from
i
think
there
be
a
very
natural
relationship
between
the
two
gate
have
always
be
very
good
at
math
in
fact
he
be
gift
on
the
math
achievement
test
lakeside
give
its
student
gate
be
the
number
one
student
in
the
school
he
later
score
a
perfect
on
the
math
portion
of
his
college
board
while
at
lakeside
he
take
advanced
math
course
at
the
university
of
washington
i
read
ahead
in
math
so
i
really
didn
t
spend
much
time
on
math
class
in
school
even
when
i
get
bad
grade
in
everything
else
which
be
up
through
the
eighth
grade
i
always
do
well
in
math
fred
wright
chairman
of
the
math
department
at
lakeside
when
gate
attend
say
of
gate
he
could
see
shortcut
through
an
algebraic
problem
or
a
computer
problem
he
could
see
the
simplest
way
to
do
thing
in
mathematics
he
s
as
good
an
analytical
mathematician
as
i
ve
work
with
in
all
my
year
of
teach
but
bill
be
really
good
in
all
area
not
just
math
he
s
get
a
lot
of
breadth
it
s
one
of
the
unusual
thing
about
him
wright
be
in
charge
of
the

in

you
have
to
understand
what
early
age
compulsion
be
like
they
be
all
consume
say
the
reverend
marvin
evans
kent

get
that

bill
and
kent

wright
amuse
by
the
antic
of
his
young

adopt
the
code
name
gymflke
to
log
on
to
the
computer
an
inside
joke
on
gate
evans
and
some
of
the
others
who
flake
out
of
gym
to
work
on
the
machine
while
the
kid
all
become
expert
at
find
confidential
user
password
and
break
computer
security
system
none
of
them
gate
include
discover
wright
s
secret
password
although
gate
be
only
in
the
low
school
before
long
some
of
the
old
boy
be
come
to
him
for
help
with
the
computer
among
them
be
paul
allen
who
would
egg
gate
on
challenge
him
to
solve
a
difficult
problem
paul
thought
i
have
this
attitude
like
i
understood
thing
gate
say
so
when
he
get
stuck
he
would
say
hey
i
bet
you
can
t
figure
this
out
he
would
kind
of
challenge
me
and
it
be
pretty
hard
stuff
as
they
spent
more
and
more
time
together
in
the
computer
room
gate
and
allen
become
friend
one
day
gate
go
to
allen
s
home
only
to
be
amaze
by
allen
s
collection
of
sci
fi
book
he
have
read
four
time
as
much
as
i
have
recall
gate
and
he
have
all
these
other
book
that
explain
thing
so
i
would
ask
him
how
do
gun
work
how
do
nuclear
reactor
work
paul
be
good
at
explain
stuff
later
we
do
some
math
stuff
and
physic
stuff
together
that
s
how
we
get
to
be
friend
it
wasn
t
surprising
that
allen
should
be
well
read
for
more
than
twenty
year
his
father
kenneth
allen
be
associate
director
of
library
for
the
university
of
washington
although
allen
could
be
just
as
intense
and
competitive
as
gate
he
be
surprisingly
soft
spoken
with
an
equally
soft
handshake
allen
talk
so
softly
in
fact
that
when
reporter
interview
him
his
voice
sometimes
fails
to
automatically
activate
their
tape
recorder
the
other
kid
at
lakeside
like
paul
allen
to
many
of
his
classmate
he
seem
more
personable
than
some
of
the
others
who
have
take
over
the
computer
room
it
be
easy
to
like
the
boy
with
the
blond
fu
manchu
mustache
and
aviator
sunglass
who
habitually
carry
a
briefcase
there
be
no
pretentiousness
in
allen
none
of
the
i
m
smarter
than
you
attitude
paul
be
cool
say
a
classmate
who
be
not
one
of
the
computer
room
crowd
he
be
a
nerd
who
didn
t
look
like
a
nerd
he
be
always
more
approachable
and
friendlier
than
bill
you
would
run
into
him
in
the
hallway
and
he
would
actually
stop
and
talk
to
you
allen
and
gate
not
only
spent
a
lot
of
time
work
together
in
the
computer
room
but
also
a
lot
of
time
talk
about
the

a
vast

of
knowledge
we
be
try
to
absorb

and
i
always
have
big
dream
of
what
we
could
do
with

ask

for
the
computer
time
use
by
their
son

and
some
of
the

soon
discover
all

the

this
meant
that
even
though
they

off
the

the

work
on

soon
ran
into
the
hundred
of

these
kid
be
very
hungry
for
time
recall
dick
wilkinson
one
of
the
partner
who
organize
computer
center
corporation
every
time
we
would
get
a
new
version
of
software
they
would
go
poke
around
in
the
system
and
we
would
have
to
forgive
some
bill
because
they
would
be
run
program
they
be
not
suppose
to
they
found
chess
on
the
system
when
they
should
not
have
so
they
would
play
a
half
game
of
chess
and
then
leave
the
lakeside
terminal
and
go
off
to

or
something
they
didn
t
understand
they

use
computer

like
it
be
go
out
of
style
the
electronic
mischief
eventually
get
out
of
hand
gate
and
a
couple
other
boy
broke
the

security
system
and
obtain
access
to
the
company
s
accounting
file
they
found
their

and
substantially
reduce
the
amount
of
the
time
the
computer
show
they
have
use
they
be
quite
proud
of
this
ingenious
accomplishment
until
they
get
caught
wilkinson
drove
out
to
lakeside
for
a
talk
with
fred
wright
the
math
teacher
in

of
the
school

like
naughty
boy
gate
and
the
others
be
march
into
the
principal
s
office
we
told
them
they
be
off
the
system
for
six
week
wilkinson
say
and
if
we
caught
them
on
it
we
would
call
the
police
because
what
they
be
do
be
illegal
they
be
all
very
contrite
they
be
pretty
good
kid
from
then
on
gate
become
even
more
of
a
problem
for
computer
center

shortly
afterward
the
very
first
basic
program
gate
write

the

the

dial
up
the

and
try

however
the

try
it
again
the
next
day
new

the

then
ask

punch
out
the

bam
just
like
that
the

crashed
again
gate
attempt
to
load
up
his
program
several
time
over
the
next
few
day
and
each
time
the
g
cubed
computer
would
break
down
this
be
not
good
news
for
computer
center
corporation
which
be
try
to
pay

attract
new
customer
and
keep
old
one
whenever
the
computer
go
down
other
pay
customer
be
also
knock
off
the
system
bad
the
computer
lose
everything
it
have
be
work
on
a
case
of
electronic
alzheimer
s
when
the
machine
come
back
up
its
memory
bank
be
blank
frustrate
programmer
at
c
cubed
eventually
figure
out
what
gate
be
do
wrong
when
the
computer
ask
him
the
name
of
his
program
he
be
suppose
to
type
only
the
word
bill
the
string
of
character
he
be
type
old
program
name
be
bill
be
too
long
for
the
machine
an
anomaly
that
cause
it
to
crash
it
be
an
exhilarate
feel
for
gate
know
he
could
single
handedly
bring
down
the
huge
computer
by
type
a
string
of
letter
he
soon
learn
however
just
how
easy
it
be
to
crash
the
pdp
the
software
that
digital
equipment
corporation
supply
with
its
pdp
be
flaky
at
best
on
good
day
the
c
cubed
system
might
stay
up
four
hour
before
crash
on
bad
day
when
there
be
lot
of
pay
customer
on
line
it
be
usually
down
within
half
an
hour
clearly
something
would
have
to
be
do
if
the
firm
be
go
to
stay
in
business
we
knew
we
have
this
reliability
problem
recall
steve
russell
one
of
the
programmer
work
for
c
cubed
we
knew
how
to
turn
the
crash
on
and
off
to
some
extent
simply
by
have
lot
of
user
and
not
have
lot
of
user
what
we
want
to
do
be
get
a
herd
of
friendly
user
that
we
could
turn
on
and
off
so
that
we
could
turn
them
on
to
test
the
system
and
turn
them
off
when
we
want
the
system
to
be
reliable
because
there
be
pay
customer
on
the
machine
make
money
for
us
so
the
company
hire
a
herd
of
friendly
user
and
they
become
the
unofficial
night
shift
c
cubed
offer
gate
and
the
other
lakeside
computer
junky
an
opportunity
to
try
to
crash
the
system
in
exchange
they
would
get
all
the
free
computer
time
they
want
they
be
simply
to
come
down
to
c
cubed
in
the
even
and
on
weekend
after
the
pay
customer
be
off
the
computer
log
onto
the
system
and
have
fun
the
only
requirement
be
that
they
be
to
carefully
document
each
bug
they
found
that
cause
the
system
to
crash
computer
bug
be
appropriately
name
in
august
of
while
work
on
an
experimental
computer
know
as
the
mark
at
harvard
university
a
circuit
malfunction
and
a
research
assistant
go
look
for
the
problem
in
the
tangle
mess
of
vacuum
tube
and
wire
he
found
the
problem
and
remove
it
with
a
pair
of
tweezer
it
be
a
inch
long

in
the
c
cubed
computer
system
prove
to
be
a
fertile
field
of
investigation
for
gate
and
the
other
boy
they
be
give
what
become
know
as
the

report
book
a
journal
of
their
discovery
and
investigation
over
the
next
six
month
the

book
grow
to
more
than
page
most
of
the
entry

make
by
just
two
boy
bill

and
paul
allen
computer

locate
in
the
city
s
university
district
in
what
have
be
an
old
buick
dealership
after
school
gate
would
rush
home
to
laurelhurst
for
dinner
then
run
to
nearby
child
s
hospital
to
catch
the
no
bus
for
the
short
ride
to
c
cubed
it
be
often
past
midnight
when
the
boy
finish
their
work
gate
would
usually
walk
home
sometimes
one
of
the
parent
would
come
by
and
drive
all
the
boy
home
it
be
when
we
get
free
time
at
c
cubed
that
we
really
get
into
computer
gate
say
i
mean
then
i
become
hard
core
it
be
day
and
night
at
this
point
gate
be
year
old
and
finish
up
the
eighth
grade
we
stayed
up
until
all
hour
of
the
night
it
be
a
fun
time
recall
allen
gate
and
allen
not
only
look
for
bug
but
they
also
look
for
any
information
that
might
help
them
learn
more
about
computer
operating
system
and
software
allen
would
hoist
gate
on
garbage
can
so
he
could
poke
around
for
important
tidbit
of
information
left
behind
by
the
day
shift
i
d
get
the
note
out
with
the
coffee
ground
on
them
and
study
the
operating
system
gate
say
kent
evans
be
often
there
late
into
the
night
with
gate
and
allen
as
be
rick
weiland
after
four
or
five
hour
work
in
front
of
a
computer
the
boy
would
send
out
for
pizza
and
coke
it
be
a
hacker
s
heaven
occasionally
a
tall
quiet
beard
fellow
by
the
name
of
gary
kildall
drop
by
in
the
evening
to
use
the
computer
and
talk
to
some
of
the
programmer
kildall
be
finish
work
on
his
ph
d
in
computer
science
at
the
university
of
washington
ten
year
later
he
would
fumble
one
of
the
big
business
opportunity
of
the
personal
computer
revolution
and
in
the
process
help
to
make
bill
gate
a
very
rich
man
the
ground
rule
set
down
by
c
cubed
for
the
night
shift
be
pretty
straightforward
the
boy
could
use
the
system
as
much
as
they
want
at
no
charge
they
be
encourage
to
try
to
crash
the
system
and
when
it
go
down
they
be
to
tell
c
cubed
what
they
have
input
when
it
crashed
the
deal
be
they
could
find
any
bug
once
but
only
once
c
cubed
would
then
de
bug
that
part
of
the
program
on
occasion
we
have
to
give
some
verbal
reprimand
for
violate
our
rule
which
be
use
the
same
bug
more
than
once
before
we
fix
it
say
steve
russell
since
we
be
give
them
time
they
have
considerable
motivation
to
play
the
game
our
way
russell
in
his
early
thirty
be
there
at
night
to
ride
herd
on
the
boy
usually
when
i
stuck
my
nose
in
on
them
i
d
get
ask
a
question
or
five
and
my
natural
inclination
be
to
answer
question
at
considerable
length
he
say
they
get
some
useful
info
from
that
steve
russell
be
famous
as
a
computer
programmer
and
the
kid
eagerly
ply
him
for

and
knew
he

all
the

over
into

unthrottled
emotion
and
occasionally
childlike
temper

several
former
classmate
vividly
remember
a
volatile
exchange
between
gate
and
physic
teacher
gary
maestretti
in
the
tenth
grade
the
two
be
heatedly
argue
with
one
another
jaw
to

in

of
the

on
a

stage
that

gate

at
the
top
of
his

wave
his
finger
hammer
away
at
maestretti
tell
him
he
be
wrong
about
a
physic
point
and
gate
be
win
the
argument
maestretti
who
now
chair
the
school
s
science
department
have
no
recollection
of
the
argument
but
he
certainly
remembers
gate
and
his
best
friend
kent
evans
write
work
from
bill
didn
t
come
across
with
a
lot
of
polish
maestretti
say
kent
evans
would
produce
copious
exploration
of
thing
bill
wasn
t
one
to
produce
a
lot
of
write
at
one
point
maestretti
try
to
encourage
gate
to
use
his
hand
as
well
as
his
intellect
as
a
project
maestretti
ask
him
to
assemble
a
radio
shack
electronics
kit
in
order
to
force
him
to
build
something
correctly
and
make
it
work
i
can
remember
when
he
brought
it
to
me
tell
me
okay
now
i
ve
satisfied
my
project
and
of
course
solder
be
drip
all
over
the
back
needle
to
say
it
didn
t
work
he
be
clearly
much
more
ethereal
and
intellectual
than
practical
the
classroom
not
the
workshop
be
gate
competitive
arena
the
intellectual
battleground
where
he
would
strive
for
the
best
test
score
or
compete
to
solve
math
and
physic
problem
faster
than
anyone
else
he
be
legendary
in
his
class
for
correctly
answer
trick
question
he
almost
always
saw
the
hidden
meaning
or
spot
the
red
herring
thrown
out
by
the
teacher
he
be
always
one
step
ahead
say
carl
edmark
his
childhood
friend
you
couldn
t
fool
him
gate
be
impatient
with
those
not
as
quick
as
he
be
teacher
include
his
science
teacher
william
dougal
once
comment
if
a
teacher
be
slow
bill
always
seem
on
the
verge
of
say
but
that
s
obvious
his
superior
attitude
rubbed
some
of
his
classmate
the
wrong
way
colby
atwood
who
be
a
year
ahead
of
gate
sat
in
front
of
gate
in
a
law
class
taught
by
lawyer
gary
little
gate
at
this
point
be
a
junior
one
day
gate
laugh
at
a
student
who
be
slow
to
answer
a
question
put
to
him
by
little
when
atwood
who
didn
t
particularly
care
for
gate
heard
him
snicker
at
his
friend
he
turn
around
grabbed
gate
by
his
shirt
and
told
him
off
little
have
to
jump
in
and
break
it
up
it
be
a
response
not
to
just
that
one
incident
but
to
an
attitude
that
gate
have
have
for
some
time
in
the
class
say
atwood
atwood
saw
gate
again
on
a
plane
year
later
when
gate
board
at
the
last
moment
he
look
rumple
tire
hair
uncombed
just
the
way
he
use
to
look
in
school
while
some
classmate
remember
gate
as
socially
awkward
and
completely
absorbed
by
the
world
of
the
lakeside
computer
room
to
those
who
knew
him
best
gate
be
hardly
the
social
outcast
he
may
have
appear
to
be
from
a
distance
he
have
a
sense
of
humor
and
adventure
he
be
a
risk
taker
a
guy
who
like
to
have
fun
and
who
be
fun
to
be
with
he
have
an
immense
range
of
knowledge
and
interest
and
could
talk
at
length
on
any
number
of
subject
anyone
who
remembers
him
as
a
nerdy
person
either
didn
t
deal
with
him
closely
or
be
remember
wrong

adolescent
kid
who
like
to
goof
off
and
take
a
break
from
the
competitiveness
of
lakeside
we
would
often
just
rap
for
hour
other
than
kent

probably
no
one
be
closer
to

like
arrogance
say
carlson
some

some
might

i
didn
t
want
to
be
paid
hourly
rate
so
we
mention
piece
rate
for
programmed
product
or
royalty
arrangement
the
royalty
scheme
go
over
big
we
get
about
ten
percent
of
the
money
isi
get
because
of
one
of
our
program
we
get
more
in
the
long
run
and
the
company
doesn
t
need
to
tie
up
any
of
its
capital
it
s
not
clear
how
much
if
anything
the
group
make
in
royalty
from
their
payroll
project
but
isi
give
them
about
worth
of
free
computer
time
if
anybody
want
to
know
why
bill
gate
be
where
he
be
today
in
my
judgment
it
s
because
of
this
early
experience
cut
deal
say
marvin
evans
kent
s
father
allen
graduate
from
lakeside
in
and
enrol
that
fall
at
washington
state
university
major
in
computer
science
but
he
and
gate
be
already
work
on
another
moneymaking
project
involve
their
own
company
which
they
call
traf
o
data
the
idea
behind
their
enterprise
be
ingenious
almost
every
municipality
use
metal
box
link
to
rubber
hose
that
stretch
across
the
roadway
to
count
car
these
traffic
box
contain
a
channel
paper
tape
twice
as
wide
as
the
channel
tape
use
in
old
teletype
machine
and
each
time
a
car
pass
over
the
rubber
hose
the
machine
punch
the
tape
with
the
binary
number
zero

the

municipality
hire
private
company
to
translate
this
raw

into

city
engineer
could
then
use
for
example
to
determine
how
long
a
traffic
light
need
to
be
red
or
green
for
the
best
traffic
flow
but
the
company
provide
these
service
be
slow
and
expensive
gate
and
allen
figure
they
could
program
a
computer
to
analyze
the
traffic
counter
tape
then
sell
the
information
to
municipality
faster
and
cheaper
than
the
competition
gate
recruit
seventh

eighth
grader
at

to
transcribe
the
number
from

allen
decide
he

thus
eliminate
the
need
for

it
prove

they

it
be
at
trw
that

begin
to
develop
as
a
serious
computer
programmer
computer
program
be
more
of
an
art
than
a
science
the
best
programmer
have
a
style
as
recognizable
to
other
programmer
as
the
brush
stroke
of
a
great
painter
gate
fancy
himself
a
master
programmer
although
today
he
hasn
t
write
code
in
year
because
he
s
too
busy
run
his
company
there
be
several
top
notch
programmer
on
the
trw
project
one
of
the
best
be
john
norton
he
like
to
write
endless
memo
comment
on
a
programmer
s
code
it
be
the
first
time
gate
have
see
anyone
respond
that
way
before
and
it
left
a
last
impression
to
this
day
gate
sends
his
own
electronic
memo
to
his
programmer
at
microsoft
comment
on
their
code
often
they
be
critical
and
sarcastic
more
than
one
unlucky
programmer
at
microsoft
have
receive
e
mail
at
a
m
that
begin
this
be
the
stupidest
piece
of
code
ever
write
norton
like
gate
and
become
something
of
a
mentor
help
the
intense
inquisitive
teenager
hone
his
program
skill
whenever
gate
make
a
mistake
or
do
sloppy
work
norton
would
review
his
code
and
explain
what
he
have
do
wrong
or
how
he
could
do
it
well
and
more
efficiently
there
be
however
still
the
matter
of
finish
high
school
in
the
spring
of
have
already
be
accepted
at
harvard
for
the

for
his
final
trimester
at

although
he
have
miss
three
month
of
school
work
he
quickly
caught
up
in
a
calculus
class
he
make
his
only
appearance
to
take
the
final
exam
which
he
ace
he
receive
a
b
in
the

however
because
the
teacher
felt
that
by
never
show
up
gate
have
not
displayed
the
right
attitude
gate
self
confidence
be
at
an
all
time
high
bill
huck
also
in
the
class
of
at

remembers
a
squash
match
with

in
the
school
gym
shortly
before
they
graduate
in
june
after
the
match
which
gate
won
huck
ask
him
so
what
s
your
story
where
do
you
go
from
here
gate
say
he
be
head
off
to
harvard
in
the
fall
then
he
add
in
a
very
matter
of
fact
way
i
m
go
to
make
my
first
million
by
the
time
i
m
it
be
not
say
as
a
boast
or
even
a
prediction
he
talk
about
the
future
as
if
his
success
be
predestine
a
give
as
certain
as
the
mathematical
proof
that
one
plus
one
equal
two
i
remember
it
not
surprising
me
say
huck
who
later
go
into
journalism
and
now
sell
medical
equipment
in
the
seattle
area
it
be
no
big
deal
that
this
gate
guy
be
ambitious
and
be
go
to
make
money
everyone
at

time
for

he
and
allen
begin
to
talk
seriously
about
form
their
own
software
company
for
some
time
now
they
have
share
the
same
vision
that
one
day
the
computer
would
be
as
commonplace
in
the
home
as
a
television
set
and
that
these
computer
would
need
software
their
software
we
always
have
big
dream
allen
say
chapter
it
s
go

he
go

no
real

his
life
although
he
list
his
academic
major
as

he
have
little
interest
in
become
a
lawyer
like
his
father
nor
do
his

have
any
expectation
that

when

receive
permission
to
take
both
graduate
and
undergraduate
course
that
be
not
unusual
for
gift
student
what
be
unusual
be
that
he
be
allow
to
set
aside
those
graduate
level
course
in
math
physic
and
computer
science
and
apply
the
credit
toward
a

later
about
two
third
of
my

toward
my
undergraduate
degree
and
about
a
third
be
set
aside
for
my
graduate
degree
although
it
all
doesn
t
matter
now
since
i
didn
t
complete
either
one
say
gate
that
first
year
he
take
one
of
harvard
s
most
difficult
math
course
call
math
almost
everyone
in
the
class
have
score
a
perfect
on
the
math
portion
of
the
scholastic
aptitude
test
gate
do
well
in
the
course
but
he
be
not
the
best
two
other
student
finish
ahead
of
him
include
andy
braiterman
who
live
in
the
same
dorm
as
gate
braiterman
have
enter
harvard
as
a
sophomore
he
and
gate
become
good
friend
and
later
room
together
gate
take
the
typical
undergraduate
course
in
economics
history
literature
and
psychology
his
attitude
toward
class
work
be
much
the
same
as
it
have
be
at
lakeside
he
work
hard
and
do
well
in
those
course
he
care
about
he
didn
t
work
hard
in
course
that
didn
t
interest
him
however
he
still
do
well
because
he
be
so
smart
in
greek
literature
his
freshman
year
gate
fell
asleep
during
the
final
exam
but
still
manage
to
receive
a
b
in
the
class
he
be
really
very
proud
of
that
recall
braiterman
it
be
a
story
he
like
to
tell
on
himself
that
gate
would
fall
asleep
in
class
be
not
surprising
he
be
living
on
the
edge
it
be
not
unusual
for
him
to
go
as
long
as
three
day
without
sleep
how
he
coped
with
lack
of
sleep
i
never
figure
out
say
znaimer
i
would
kind
of
wimp
out
after
to
hour
but
his
habit
be
to
do
hour
or
more
at
a
stretch
collapse
for
ten
hour
then
go
out
get
a
pizza
and
go
back
at
it
and
if
that
meant
he
be
start
again
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
so
be
it
his
sleep
habit
be
just
as
bizarre
gate
never
slept
on
sheet
he
would
collapse
on
his
unmade
bed
pull
an
electric
blanket
over
his
head
and
fall
asleep
instantly
and
soundly
regardless
of
the
hour
or
activity
in
his
room
gate
still
fall
asleep
instantaneously
when
he
fly
he
often
put
a
blanket
over
his
head
and
sleep
for
the
entire
flight
he
didn
t
seem
to
pay
much
attention
to
thing
he
didn
t
care
about
whether
it
be
clothes
or
sleep
say
znaimer
to
his
roommate
and
the
small
group
of
student
he
hung
out
with
gate
be
a
very
intense
character
he
would
often
work
himself
into
a
frenzy
of
energy
and
start
rock
back
and
forth
head
in
his
hand
during
a
conversation
or
while
reading
or
concentrate
on
a
mental
problem
sometimes
he
would
wave
his
arm
madly
about
to
make
a
point
in
conversation
much
of
this
energy
be
direct
toward
computer
just
as
it
have
be
at
lakeside
although
gate
may
not
have
decide
what
he
be
go
to
do
with
his
life
when
he
enter
harvard
to
those
who
knew
him

little
doubt
about
his
real
passion

week
during
his
first
year
there
on
a
basic
program

which
require
that
he
figure
out
highly
complex
algorithm
that
would
represent
figure
on
the
computer
screen
hit
throw
and
catch
a
baseball
even
when
he
be
sound
asleep

won
he
become
an
exceptional
player
at
both
pinball
and
pong
other
than
play
pinball
and
go
to
a
lot
of
movie
say
znaimer
we
be
all
do
our
share
of
sex
drug
and
rock
n
roll
with
the
exception
that
the
rest
of
us
be
more
overwhelmed
by
our
hormone
than
bill
i
don
t
remember
him
chase
any
woman
and
there
be
lot
of
opportunity
no
one
who
knew
gate
at
harvard
can
recall
him
ever
date
anyone
while
he
be
there
he
do
see
one
young
woman
occasionally
when
he
return
home
on
holiday
break
to
seattle
but
they
be
not
romantically
involve
the
woman
be
karen
gloyd
a
freshman
at
whitman
college
in
washington
state
gloyd
be
a
couple
year
young
than
gate
have
enter
college
early
at
age
they
met
through
their
parent
her
stepfather
be
on
the
state
bar
association
s
board
of
governor
as
be
gate
father
gate
do
not
make
a
very
good
impression
on
gloyd
he
lack
the
social
grace
a
young
lady
would
have
expect
of
a
harvard
man
it
be
clear
to
gloyd
that
gate
have
have
little
experience
with
woman
the
first
thing
he
want
to
know
when
they
met
be
the
score
she
make
on
her
college
sat
it
didn
t
strike
me
as
be
a
great
pickup
line
at
the
time
recall
gloyd
now
married
it
s
kind
of
amuse
look
back
on
it
but
at
the
time
i
really
wasn
t
that
amuse
i
thought
maybe
i
hadn
t
heard
him
right
i
thought
it
rather
odd
to
say
the
least
gate
then
proceed
to
explain
to
gloyd
that
he
have
take
his
scholastic
aptitude
test
twice
so
he
could
make
a
perfect
score
of
math
and
verbal
score
each
count
a
maximum
of
point
gate
told
her
that
when
he
first
take
the
test
he
breeze
through
the
math
portion
but
make
a
silly
mistake
and
end
up
with
point
the
second
time
he
take
the
test
he
get
a
perfect
math
score
of
at
that
point
in
the
conversation
say
gloyd
i
assume
we
have
very
little
in
common
they
do
see
each
other
a
few
more
time
once
when
both
be
home
from
college
they
accompany
their
father
on
a
bar
association
trip
to
friday
harbor
in
the
scenic
san
juan
island
gloyd
and
several
other
young
people
on
the
trip
take
off
in
their
parent
car
and
go
into
town
at
night
to
dance
and
party
gate
however
stayed
behind
and
played
poker
with
the
adult
bill
and
i
played
tennis
together
a
few
time
but
we
really
didn
t
have
much
in
common
socially
say
gloyd
i
always
thought
he
be
really
nice
but
i
just
thought
he
be
sort
of
a
brain
and
i
be
more
into
party
sorority
and
that
kind
of
thing
bill
be
real
shy
i
didn
t
get
the
impression
at
the
time
that
he
have
a
lot
of
experience
date
girl
and
go
out
and
do
social
thing
i
may
have
thought
of
him
then
as
be
nerdy
but
i
think
he
just
didn
t
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
do
thing
he
wasn
t
interested
in
although
gate
may
not
have
have
much
experience
with
girl
he
do
have
experience
of
another
kind
that
set
him
apart
from
many
of
his
peer
at
harvard
he
have
already
be
out
there
in
the
real
world
he
even
have
his
own
company
traf
o
data
that
be
one
of
the
more
interest
thing
about
bill
say
znaimer
compare
to
the
rest
of
us
at
harvard
he
be
much
more
broadly
ground
you
could
find
other
people
who
be
really
good
mathematician
or
really
good
physicist
but
bill
have
a
lot
more
hand
on
experience
he
have
go
and
work
in
various
environment
like
trw
znaimer
remember
gate
spending
several
night
in
his
dorm
room
in
early
work
on
an
irs
tax
return
for
his
traf
o
data
business
i
could
not
have
told
you
which
way
be
up
on
a
tax
form
it
be
something
my
parent
do
znaimer
say
but
bill
sure
knew
while
gate
be
finish
his
first
year
at

paul
allen

allen
for
this
service
when
the
fed
would
do
it
for
nothing
their
contract
in
canada
be
not
enough
to
keep
the
business
go
at
one
point
they
even
consider
sell
traf
o
data
machine
to
a
firm
in
brazil
but
the
deal
fell
through
with
their
company
on
the
skid
gate
and
allen
begin
have
long
telephone
discussion
about
what
they
should
do
next
allen
decide
he
would
join
his
friend
after
gate
complete
his
first

they
would
work
together
and

head
east

in
three

when

for
the
rest
of
the

allen
be
convince
the
computer
industry
be
about
to
reach
critical
mass
and
when
it
explode
it
would
usher
in
a
technological
revolution
of
astound
magnitude
they
be
on
the
threshold
of
one
of
those
moment
when
history
held
its
breath
and
jumped
as
it
have
do
with
the
development
of
the
car
and
the
airplane
computer
power
be
about
to
come
to
the
mass
their
vision
of
a
computer
in
every
home
be
no
longer
a
wild
dream
it
s
go
to
happen
allen
kept
tell
his
friend
and
they
could
either
lead
the
revolution
or
be
swept
along
by
it
allen
be
much
more
eager
to
start
a
company
than
gate
who
be
worried
about
the
reaction
from
his
family
if
he
drop
out
of
school
paul
kept
say
let
s
start
a
company
let
s
do
it
gate
recall
paul
saw
that
the
technology
be
there
he
kept
say
it
s
gonna
be
too
late
we
ll
miss
it
for
a
while
they
consider
building
their
own
computer
allen
be
more
interested
in
computer
hardware
than
gate
whose
interest
be
pure
software
the
soul
of
the
machine
as
a
boy
allen
have
read
electronics
magazine
and
built
radio
and
shortwave
set
he
have
work
with
vacuum
tube
transistor
and
finally
with
integrate
circuit
when
he
help
design
the
traf
o
data
machine
but
that
experience
also
taught
him
what
it
take
to
build
a
computer
he
and
gate
soon
abandon
the
idea
they
decide
to
stick
with
what
they
knew
best
software
building
a
computer
be
too
hair
raise
we
saw
that
hardware
be
a
black
art
allen
say
that
be
not
our
area
of
expertise
our
forte
be
software
by
the
fall
of
gate
have
decide
he
would
remain
in
school
the
time
just
wasn
t
right
to
start
their
company
allen
stayed
on
at
honeywell
while

former

confuse
about
his

would
later

that
he
spent
many
hour

depressed

a
pretty
good
player
bill
have
a
monomaniacal
quality

his
roommate
he
would
focus
on
something

really
stick
with
it
he
have
a
determination
to
master
whatever
it
be
he
be
do
perhaps
it
s
silly
to
compare

the
medical
school

come
in

they
weren
t
very
good
so
we
would
raise
the
stake
and
people
would
lose
their

gate
he
say
have
a
tendency
to
play
out
his

to
the
costly
end
whenever
he
believe
he
have
correctly
read
other
player
at
the
table
because
of
this
tendency
drill

nickname
for
gate

of
the
day
here
come
the
gravy
train
drill
would
say
as
gate
relentlessly
threw
more
and
more
chip
into
the
pot
refuse
to
fold
his
hand
my
perception
of
bill
s
lifestyle
and
it
be
a
lot
of
people
s
perception
be
that
he
spent
his
time
either
play
poker
or
in
the
computer
room
recall
drill
one
student
at
currier
house
who
heard
all
about
gate
poker
exploit
be
steve
ballmer
who
live
just
down
the
hall
after
a
long
night
of
gamble
gate
would
sometimes
drop
by
ballmer
s
room
to
recount
his
adventure
at
the
poker
table
ballmer
be
usually
awake
he
be
able
to
go
without
sleep
as
long
as
gate
could
they
have
the
same
intensity
level
the
same
unlimited
energy
source
they
be
on
the
same
wavelength
in
gatesspeak
it
s
know
as
high
bandwidth
communication
or
the
amount
of
information
one
can
absorb
the
two
would
often
engage
in
heat
debate
exchange
information
at
a
high
band
rate
like
two
computer
connect
by
modem
a
short
while
into
most
conversation
gate
and
ballmer
would
start
rock
in
sync
talk
at
the
same
time
but
hearing
every
word
the
other
say
several
year
later
gate
would
ask
ballmer
to
join
him
at
the
control
of
the
microsoft
joyride
he
would
become
the
second
most
influential
person
in
the
company
next
to
chairman
bill
ballmer
be
much
more
social
than
gate
he
seem
to
know
everyone
at
harvard
he
convince
gate
to
join
the
men
s
club
at
currier
house
as
an
initiation
rite
gate
be
blindfold
dress
in
a
tuxedo
and
brought
to
the
din
room
table
where
he
be
order
to
talk
about
computer
just
as
gate
want
to
be
accepted
as
one
of
the
boy
back
at
lakeside
in
seattle
he
also
want
to
fit
in
at
harvard
to
belong
to
a
fraternity
and
be
part
of
the
group
but
it
wasn
t
in
his
nature
despite
his
association
with
the
outgo
ballmer
gate
be
very
much
a
loner
with
only
a
small
group
of
friend
his
shyness
often
come
across
as
aloofness
bill
and
steve
be
polar
opposite
say
braiterman
bill
be
really
not
a
social
kind
of
guy
he
be
not
the
sort
of
person
who
hung
out
with
a
lot
of
people
i
don
t
mean
he
wasn
t
social
in
the
sense
of
be
unfriendly
or
anything
he
just
wasn
t
very
outgo
steve
be
ballmer
do
not
have
the
passion
for
computer
or
the
technical
background
that
gate
have
but
he
do
share
his
interest
in
mathematics
ballmer
be
work
on
a
degree
in
apply
mathematics
at
one
time
in
high
school
gate
have
thought
about
become
a
mathematician
it
be
one
of
many
career
possibility
now
at
harvard
he
be
have
second
thought
as
he
size
up
his
competition
still
he
continued
to
take
graduate
level
math
course
his
sophomore
year
he
would
sit
in
class
without
even
a
pad
of
paper
rest
his
head
on
his
hand
recall
henry
leitner
who
take
a
graduate
math
course
with
gate
on
the
theory
of
computation
he
would
look
very
bore
then
a
half
hour
into
a
proof
on
the
blackboard
bill
would
raise
his
hand
and
blurt
out
you
make
a
mistake
i
ll
show
you
then
he
would
trace
the
mistake
back
he
would
stump
the
teacher
he
seem
to
take
great
joy
in
that
leitner
now
a
senior
lecturer
in
computer
science
at
harvard
be
a
graduate
student
at
the
time
he
and
gate
sat
next
to
each
other
in
class
and
be
suppose
to
collaborate
on
homework
problem
but
leitner
couldn
t
get
the
young
gate
to
work
on
problem
he
didn
t
think
worthy
of
his
time
gate
only
like
the
challenge
of
the
most
difficult
problem
i
use
to
wonder
what
i
be
do
try
to
work
with
this
guy
say
leitner
he
would
only
do
about
percent
of
the
work
but
it
be
worth
it
a
couple
minute
on
the
phone
with
him
and
he
would
straighten
me
out
on
a
complex
math
problem
he
be
a
real
character
at
lakeside
gate
have
be
the
best
student
in
the
school
at
math
even
at
harvard
he
be
one
of
the
top
math
student
but
he
be
not
the
best
he
have
met
several
student
well
than
he
be
at
math
include
fred
commoner
the
son
of
scientist
author
barry
commoner
gate
eventually
give
up
any
thought
of
become
a
mathematician
if
he
couldn
t
be
the
best
in
his
field
why
risk
failure
i
met
several
people
in
the
math
department
who
be
quite
a
bit
well
than
i
be
at
math
say
gate
it
change
my
view
about
go
into
math
you
can
persevere
in
the
field
of
math
and
make
incredible
breakthrough
but
it
probably
discourage
me
it
make
the
odds
much
longer
that
i
could
do
some
world
class
thing
i
have
to
really
think
about
it
hey
i
m
go
to
sit
in
a
room
star
at
a
wall
for
five
year
and
even
if
i
come
up
with
something
who
know
so
it
make
me
think
about
whether
math
be
something
i
want
to
do
or
not
but
there
be
so
many
choice
my
mind
be
pretty
much
open
i
thought
law
would
be
fun
i
thought
physiological
psychology
the
study
of
the
brain
would
be
fun
i
thought
work
in
artificial
intelligence
would
be
fun
i
thought
theoretical
computer
science
would
be
fun
i
really
have
not
zeroed
in
on
something
it
s
not
well
know
outside
a
few
of
his
professor
but
gate
do
make
one
small
but
noteworthy
contribution
in
the
field
of
mathematics
while
at
harvard
he
help
advance
the
solution
to
a
mathematical
puzzle
that
have
be
around
for
some
time
no
one
have
come
up
with
a
definitive
solution
this
be
the
puzzle
as
it
have
appear
in
several
mathematical
journal
the
chef
in
our
place
be
sloppy
and
when
he
prepares
a
stack
of
pancake
they
come
out
all
different
size
therefore
when
i
deliver
them
to
a
customer
on
the
way
to
the
table
i
rearrange
them
so
that
the
small
wind
up
on
top
and
so
on
down
to
the
large
at
the
bottom
by
grab
several
from
the
top
and
flip
them
over
repeat
this
vary
the
number
i
flip
as
many
time
as
necessary
if
there
be
n
pancake
what
be
the
maximum
number
of
flip
as
a
function
of
n
that
i
will
ever
have
to
use
to
rearrange
them
gate
be
assist
in
his
work
on
the
puzzle
by
then
harvard
professor
christos
papadimitriou
who
taught
computer
science
gate
consider
the
math
puzzle
very
similar
to
the
kind
of
challenge
he
face
when
work
on
a
complicate
computer
program
in
which
he
have
to
design
algorithm
to
solve
a
specific
problem
this
be
a
simple
problem
that
have
prove
very
stubborn
say
papadimitriou
bill
claimed
to
have
a
way
of
do
it
well
than
anyone
else
and
i
be
patient
enough
to
suffer
through
his
long
and
ingenious
explanation
later
papadimitriou
decide
to
write
up
bill
s
solution
and
it
be
publish
in
in
the
journal
discrete
mathematics
the
breakthrough
gate
make
on
the
puzzle
have
remain
on
the
cut
edge
of
the
field
for
the
past
or
so
year
accord
to
papadimitriou
who
be
now
at
the
university
of
california
in
san
diego
the
professor
occasionally
give
the
puzzle
to
some
of
his
student
and
tell
them
if
they
solve
it
he
will
quit
his
job
and
work
for
them
i
should
have
do
this
with
bill
he
say
gate
may
not
have
be
the
best
math
student
at
harvard
but
he
have
no
peer
in
computer
science
his
professor
be
impressed
not
only
by
his
smart
but
his
enormous
energy
there
s
one
in
a
handful
who
come
through
in
computer
science
that
you
know
from
the
day
they
show
up
on
the
doorstep
they
will
be
very
very
good
say
professor
tom
cheatham
director
of
the
center
for
research
and
compute
technology
at
harvard
no
doubt
he
be
go
to
go
place
although
gate
take
several
computer
science
class
from
cheatham
they
do
not
like
each
other
gate
have
a
bad
personality
and
a
great
intellect
recall
cheatham
in
a
place
like
harvard
where
there
be
a
lot
of
bright
kid
when
you
be
well
than
your
peer
some
tend
to
be
nice
and
others
obnoxious
he
be
the
latter
when
gate
wasn
t
play
poker
at
night
he
be
usually
work
in
the
aiken
computer
center
that
be
when
the
machine
be
least
use
sometimes
an
exhaust
gate
would
fall
asleep
on
computer
work
table
instead
of
return
to
his
room
at
currier
house
there
be
many
morning
when
i
would
find
him
dead
asleep
on
the
table
recall
leitner
the
graduate
math
student
who
be
also
interested
in
computer
i
remember
think
he
be
not
go
to
amount
to
anything
he
seem
like
a
hacker
a
nerd
i
knew
he
be
bright
but
with
those
glass
his
dandruff
sleep
on
table
you
sort
of
form
that
impression
i
obviously
didn
t
see
the
future
as
clearly
as
he
do
but
paul
allen
saw
the
future
he
may
have
see
it
even
more
clearly
than
gate
on
a
cold
winter
day
in
december
allen
be
walk
across
harvard
square
in
cambridge
on
his
way
to
visit
gate
when
he
stop
at
a
kiosk
and
spot
the
upcoming
january
issue
of
popular
electronics
a
magazine
he
have
read
regularly
since
childhood
this
issue
however
sent
his
heart
pound
on
the
cover
be
a

of
the

him

allen
who
be
still
work
at

in

boston
i
told
bill
well
here
s
our
opportunity
to
do
something
with
basic
he
convince
his
young
friend
to
stop
play
poker
long
enough
to
finally
do
something
with
this
new

allen
a

of
what

ii
the

to
mit
in
albuquerque
from
gate
room
in
currier
house
it
have
be
only
a
few
day
since
he
and
allen
have
read
the
popular
electronics
article
on
the
altair
they
have
do
little
but
talk
since
a
man
with
a
deep
gruff
sound
voice
come
on
the
phone
at
the
other
end
hello
be
this
ed
robert
gate
ask
in
his
high
pitch
boyish
voice
told
it
be
gate
proceed
to
explain
with
youthful
bravado
that
he
and
his
friend
have
developed
a
basic
that
could
be
adapt
for
the
altair
computer
in
fact
they
didn
t
have
a
program
at
all
and
robert
suspect
as
much
he
have
heard
such
boast
already
we
have
at
least
people
approach
us
say
they
have
a
basic
recall
robert
we
just
told
everyone
include
those
guy
whoever
show
up
first
with
a
work
basic
have
the
deal
gate
and
allen
follow
up
the
phone
call
with
a
letter
to
robert
reiterate
that
they
do
indeed
have
a
basic
that
work
with
the
intel
chip
they
propose
an
arrange
ment
whereby
they
would
license
mit
to
sell
their
software
with
the
altair
to
hobbyist
and
in
return
they
would
be
paid
royalty
they
sent
the
letter
on
traf
o
data
letterhead
when
robert
receive
the
letter
and
call
the
number
on
the
letterhead
he
found
he
have
reach
a
private
school
in
seattle
no
one
at
lakeside
knew
anything
about
a
basic
for
the
altair
what
be
an
altair
someone
want
to
know
this
be
curious
indeed
robert
thought
who
be
these
guy
high
school
prankster
back
at
harvard
gate
and
allen
have
hunker
down
in
the
aiken
computer
center
like
a
couple
of
school
boy
caught
in
a
lie
they
be
furiously
try
to
cover
their
track
they
have
told
robert
they
have
a
basic
and
now
they
have
to
produce
one
before
all
those
other
competitor
who
undoubtedly
be
also
try
to
make
good
on
their
exaggerated
claim
for
the
next
eight
week
the
two
would
work
day
and
night
in
the
computer
room
try
to
do
what
some
expert
at
intel
say
couldn
t
be
do
develop
a
high
level
computer
language
for
the
chip
gate
not
only
stop
go
to
all
his
class
he
even
give
up
his
beloved
poker
game
his
poker
pal
knew
something
be
go
on
as
soon
as
bjll
start
miss
the
game
it
be
obvious
he
be
up
to
something
but
none
of
us
knew
what
it
be
say
greg
nelson
one
of
the
poker
regular
gate
and
allen
didn
t
have
an
altair
which
make
their
task
especially
difficult
robert
have
the
only
up
and
run
altair
in
existence
and
he
be
in
new
mexico
the
popular
electronics
article
contain
the
computer
s
schematic
which
would
help
but
what
they
really
need
be
detailed
information
about
the
chip
so
they
go
to
an
electronics
shop
in
cambridge
and
bought
a
manual
on
the
write
by
adam
osborne
an
intel
engineer
whose
job
be
to
write
technical
manual
for
the
company
s
new
microcomputer
chip
osborne
a
stately
bangkok
born
englishman
would
soon
become
a
very
famous
player
in
this
new
revolution
he
would
make
a
fortune
publishing
the
first
microcomputer
book
before
building
his
own
version
of
the
altair
while
gate
concentrate
his
effort
on
write
code
for
the
basic
allen
do
the
more
technical
work
with
the
pdp
in
the
aiken
computer
center
they
would
have
to
create
their
basic
with
some
brilliant
innovation
since
they
didn
t
have
an
altair
allen
have
to
make
the
pdp
mimic
the
chip
it
require
all
his
technical
knowledge
and
skill
but
he
eagerly
accepted
this
new
challenge
all
those
day
in
the
computer
room
at
lakeside
those
all
nighters
at
c
cubed
hack
away
on
computer
at
the
university
of
washington
building
the
traf
o
data
machine
learn
about
the
chip
all
his
previous
experience
with
computer
have
prepared
allen
for
what
he
and
gate
now
face
we
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
allen
would
say
later
because
of
our
previous
experience
bill
and
i
have
the
tool
to
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
this
new
situation
gate
face
different
challenge
than
his
friend
he
have
to
write
slick
tight
code
and
make
it
fit
into
the
maximum
k
memory
of
the
altair
it
be
like
try
to
squeeze
his
size
foot
into
size
eight
shoe
actually
it
be
a
tighter
fit
than
that
their
basic
not
only
have
to
fit
in
the
limited
memory
space
but
room
have
to
be
left
over
to
run
program
what
be
the
use
of
have
a
basic
if
there
be
no
memory
left
in
the
computer
to
do
anything
it
wasn
t
a
question
of
whether
i
could
write
the
program
gate
say
but
rather
a
question
of
whether
i
could
squeeze
it
into
k
and
make
it
super
fast
he
do
gate
say
later
that
of
all
the
code
he
ever
write
he
be
most
proud
of
the
basic
program
developed
in
those
eight
week
at
harvard
it
be
the
coolest
program
i
ever
write
gate
say
no
one
have
ever
write
a
basic
for
a
microcomputer
in
that
sense
gate
and
allen
be
blazing
the
trail
for
future
software
developer
and
establish
the
industry
standard
they
would
decide
rather
than
the
marketplace
the
minimum
feature
their
basic
need
the
two
work
at
a
frantic
pace
in
the
computer
lab
often
for
day
at
a
stretch
with
only
an
hour
or
two
of
sleep
when
he
be
so
exhaust
he
could
no
longer
program
gate
would
lay
down
behind
the
pdp
for
short
catnap
occasionally
he
would
nod
off
at
the
computer
keyboard
then
wake
up
with
a
start
and
immediately
start
type
again
he
and
allen
take
about
as
much
time
to
eat
as
they
do
to
sleep
one
day
during
a
quick
meal
break
in
the
din
hall
at
currier
house
they
be
talk
about
the
math
package
that
would
be
need
as
part
of
the
basic
this
be
a
subprogram
know
as
float
point
routine
which
manipulate
the
number
in
a
computer
the
routine
implement
basic
operation
like
addition
subtraction
multiplication
and
division
both
gate
and
allen
knew
how
to
write
this
subprogram
but
neither
want
to
spend
the
time
do
so
sit
at
their
table
and
overhear
the
conversation
about
float
point
routine
be
another
student
monte
davidoff
the
talk
have
caught
his
ear
because
he
have
do
this
kind
of
program
before
davidoff
spoke
up
i
know
how
to
do
that
he
say
gate
and
allen
want
to
know
more
after
talk
with
davidoff
for
awhile
they
told
him
about
the
altair
project
they
be
work
on
davidoff
say
he
would
like
to
help
several
day
later
they
give
him
the
word
he
be
in
but
payment
for
his
work
be
left
up
in
the
air
we
just
have
an
oral
agreement
recall
davidoff
who
now
work
for
a
computer
and
electronics
firm
in
cupertino
california
they
didn
t
know
if
the
thing
be
go
to
make
any
money
they
felt
there
be
the
potential
to
make
some
money
and
if
they
do
make
money
they
would
pay
me
so
i
just
trust
them
and
left
it
loose
like
gate
davidoff
neglect
his
study
to
work
full
time
on
his
part
of
the
project
he
would
become
the
forgotten
man
of
basic
year
later
when
gate
begin
appear
on
the
cover
of
national
magazine
and
reporter
write
story
about
how
the
harvard
dropout
and
his
sidekick
allen
developed
the
industry
s
first
basic
and
become
rich
and
famous
there
be
never
any
word
of
monte
davidoff
he
be
mention
once
just
briefly
in
the
book
fire
in
the
valley
but
even
then
his
first
name
be
misspell
as
marty
the
first
time
i
saw
bill
on
the
cover
of
time
magazine
and
it
say
he
and
paul
write
this
and
it
didn
t
mention
me
i
be
a
little
upset
say
davidoff
but
i
ve
gotten
over
it
gate
and
allen
be
about
four
week
into
the
project
when
davidoff
join
the
team
they
have
already
talk
several
time
with
mit
engineer
in
albuquerque
seek
information
about
the
altair
not
found
in
the
popular
electronics
article
robert
want
to
know
how
soon
they
could
come
to
albuquerque
to
demonstrate
a
work
basic
gate
have
initially
told
robert
he
could
have
the
basic
to
him
in
three
or
four
week
it
would
not
be
the
last
time
he
seriously
underestimated
how
long
it
would
take
to
develop
a
product
gate
do
write
the
initial
program
in
about
three
week
but
he
spent
four
more
week
polish
the
rough
edge
until
it
be
as
tight
and
fast
as
he
want
it
but
since
they
didn
t
have
an
altair
they
have
no
way
of
know
if
it
would
really
work
by
late
february
they
felt
they
be
ready
allen
would
be
the
one
to
fly
out
to
mit
on
the
eve
of
allen
s
appointment
with
robert
gate
told
his
friend
to
go
home
and
get
some
sleep
so
he
would
have
his
wit
about
him
the
next
day
gate
remain
in
the
computer
room
make
last
minute
fix
in
the
program
he
barely
have
it
ready
in
time
for
allen
to
catch
his
early
morning
flight
out
of
boston
s
logan
international
airport
as
his
plane
be
on
its
final
approach
into
albuquerque
allen
suddenly
have
a
horrible
thought
oh
my
god
he
cry
out
loud
startle
the
passenger
seat
next
to
him
he
and
gate
have
forgotten
to
write
what
s
know
as
a
bootstrap
a
program
that
would
instruct
the
altair
how
to
load
basic
write
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
complicate
machine
language
allen
have
the
program
complete
before
the
jet
s
wheel
peel
rubber
on
the
runway
of
the
albuquerque
airport
later
allen
and
the
always
competitive
gate
would
have
a
contest
to
see
who
could
write
the
shortest
loader
program
gate
won
ed
robert
met
allen
at
the
airport
he
be
drive
an
old
pickup
truck
allen
have
not
be
sure
what
he
would
find
when
he
arrive
in
albuquerque
he
certainly
wasn
t
prepared
for
the
giant
who
be
there
to
greet
him
but
he
be
in
for
an
even
great
shock
when
robert
take
him
to
mit
micro
instrumentation
telemetry
system
inc
be
locate
just
off
famous
route
in
a
string
of
business
that
pass
as
a
downtown
mall
there
be
a
massage
parlor
on
one
side
a
laundromat
on
the
other
robert
told
allen
he
want
to
wait
until
the
next
morning
to
test
the
basic
so
after
a
short
visit
he
drove
allen
to
the
most
expensive
hotel
in
town
the
future
billionaire
didn
t
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
his
hotel
room
he
have
to
borrow
extra
cash
from
robert
that
night
allen
call
an
anxious
gate
wait
back
in
cambridge
he
told
his
friend
about
the
guy
who
have
picked
him
up
in
a
run
down
pickup
told
him
about
the
low
budget
operation
he
have
see
that
afternoon
they
be
both
disappointed
and
worried
they
have
thought
all
along
they
be
do
business
with
a
big
successful
company
have
their
effort
be
waste
the
next
morning
robert
come
by
to
get
allen
and
they
return
to
mit
it
be
time
to
test
the
basic
the
code
be
on
a
paper
tape
unlike
the
altair
kit
that
would
be
sell
to
the
public
the
machine
at
mit
have
several
perk
unavailable
on
the
public
model
this
altair
be
run
on
k
of
memory
and
it
be
connect
to
a
teletype
allen
would
not
have
to
read
the
flash
light
to
understand
output
from
the
altair
but
best
of
all
this
altair
be
hooked
into
a
paper
tape
reader
allen
could
feed
his
basic
tape
directly
into
the
machine
otherwise
it
would
have
meant
flip
the
toggle
switch
on
the
front
of
the
altair
approximately
time
in
proper
sequence
the
only
thing
allen
have
to
key
into
the
machine
be
the
loader
program
allen
cross
his
finger
this
be
the
first
time
he
have
ever
touch
the
altair
any
mistake
he
and
gate
have
make
along
the
way
either
in
design
the
simulator
or
cod
the
basic
itself
would
now
mean
failure
suddenly
the
altair
come
to
life
it
print

size
allen
enter
k
the

be
ready
for
its
first
instruction
allen
typed
print
the
altair
print
out
the
correct
answer
those
guy
be
really
stun
to
see
their
computer
work
allen
say
this
be
a
fly
by
night
computer
company
i
be
pretty
stun
myself
that
it
work
the

i
try
not
to
show
much
surprise
recall
robert

that
historic
moment
when
his

turn
into
a
useful
computer
i
be
dazzle
it
be
certainly
impressive
the
altair
be
a
complex
system
and
they
have
never
see
it
before
what
they
have
do
go
a
lot
far
than
you
could
have
reasonably
expect
i
d
be
involve
with
the
development
of
program
for
computer
for
a
long
time
and
i
be
very
impressed
that
we
get
anywhere
near
as
far
as
we
do
that
day
later
that
morning
allen

very
similar
to
the

the

how
to

cause
a
riot
the

and
packed
away

attitude
here
be
that
the
kid
could
use
the

use
say
cheatham
but
after
the
gate
incident
there
be
tighter

it
s
not
clear
how
much
trouble
gate
get

for
allow

he
later
write
a
letter
to
the
university

complain
about
the
lack

by
the

for
albuquerque

go
back
to

about

told
the

he
be
not
sure
how
long
he

but
thought
likely
until
his
friend
at
harvard
could
join
him
in
a
couple
of
month
allen
didn
t
care
about
the
cheap
accommodation
or
the
motel
s
seedy
surroundings
the
important
thing
be
that
he
be
only
a
five
minute
walk
from
mit
where
he
would
be
spending
most

in

the

furiously
work
on

for

the
response
to
the
popular

article
have
be
nothing
short
of
phenomenal
fire
the
imagination
of
electronics
hobbyist
and
computer
hacker
across
the
country
who
have
dream
of
one
day
own
a
computer
and
now
they
could
for
the
very
affordable
price
of
you
ve
get
to
remember
that
in
those
day
the
idea
that
you
could
own
a
computer
your
own
computer
be
about
as
wild
as
the
idea
today
of
own
your
own
nuclear
submarine
it
be
beyond
comprehension
say
eddie
curry
who
join
mit
as
executive
vice
president
soon
after
allen
arrive
they
quickly
become

several
floor
and
have
a
staff
to
maintain
them
and
a
priesthood
to
watch
over
them
a
large
part
of
the
success
of
the
altair
and
the
microcomputer
that
follow
be
the
desire
of
people
just
to
own
one
it
didn
t
really
matter
if
they
could
do
anything
with
the
computer
everybody
knew
you
could
do
something
with
them
but
nobody
knew
what
the
mere
fact
that
you
own
a

be
very
prestigious
curry
a
childhood
friend
of
robert
be
in

school
when
robert
told
him
his
idea
of

they
talk
a
lot
on
the

run
up

they
alternate
payment
of
the

curry
couldn
t
afford
such
extravagance
while

which
take
many

most
of

they

with

but
this
late
news
take
his

by
surprise
he
want
to
start
a
company
not
in
seattle
his
hometown
where
he
would
be
close
to
his
family
but
in
albuquerque
of
all
place
way
out
in
the
desert
of
new
mexico
as
mary
gate
saw
it
her
year
old
son
be
about
to
commit
what
amount
to
academic
suicide
she
be
dead
set
against
her
son
leave
school
before
get
his
degree
dan
evans
the
governor
of
washington
and
a
close
family
friend
who
have
once
help

paint
the

on
the

how
would
it
look
for

his

both
recognize
that
they

not

i

there
be
an
unwritten
understand
between

the

that
we
wouldn

curl
up
on

sound
asleep
bill

paul
be
very
very
intense
say
curry
they
have
a
clear
understand
of

it
wasn

just
that
they
be
develop
basic
i
don
t
think
most
people
ever
really
understood
this
but
bill
certainly
always
have
the
vision
from
the
time
that
i
met
him
that
microsoft
s
mission
in
life
be
to
provide
all
the
software
for
microcomputer
gate
allen
and
the
other
programmer
get
along
with
curry
but
not
curiously
with
robert
the
microsoft
employee
have
long
hair
and
kept
strange
hour
they
listen
to
rock
n
roll
music
while
robert
prefer
easy
listen
music
as
soon
as
robert
would
leave
recall
david
bunnell
they
d
switch
to
rock
n
roll
i
couldn
t
see
how
they
ever
get
any
work
do
with
that
acid
rock
music
blaring
out
all
the
time
day
and
night
in
addition
robert
consider
gate
something
of
a
smarta
they
be
both
extraordinarily
well
read
and
would
often
debate
issue
unrelated
to
computer
should
the
united
state
have
drop
the
atomic
bomb
on
japan
regardless
of
what
side
gate
take
on
an
issue
robert
take
the
opposite
seemingly
out
of
spite
rather
than
conviction
the
gangly
teenager
clearly
get
under
robert
skin
it
be
inevitable
the
two
would
clash
about
more
serious
matter
as
well
and
they
do
often
and
angrily
the
burly
robert
who
could
be
surly
authoritative
and
intimidate
be
use
to
get
his
way
no
one
at
mit
get
along
in
complete
harmony
with
robert
employee
either
do
thing
his
way
or
encounter
fierce
opposition
gate
on
the
other
hand
didn
t
back
down
regardless
of
how
formidable
robert
could
be
bill
could
be
fairly
prickly
say
nelson
winkle
the
first
editor
of
personal
compute
magazine
he
have
his
own
view
of
what
mit
ought
to
be
do
and
how
they
should
do
it
he
be
very
much
self
possess
although
he
wasn
t
old
enough
yet
to
order
a
beer
legally
the
foot
ll
gate
stood
his
ground
with
robert
often
go
jaw
to
jaw
with
the
huge
gruff
man
year
his
senior
robert
weigh
close
to
pound
and
at
foot
tower
over
gate
bill
be
brash
very
intelligent
and
energetic
recall
bunnell
i
knew
of
no
one
who
would
go
to
the
wall
with
ed
until
i
met
bill
gate
in
gate
mind
every
good
idea
at
mit
be
only
halfexecuted
and
he
didn
t
hesitate
to
let
robert
know
how
he
felt
mit
be
run
in
a
very
strange
way
he
say
and
everyone
there
felt
very
poorly
we
all
thought
gee
this
thing
be
a
mess
and
there
be
a
vacuum
of
leadership
it
be
actually
kind
of
unusual
even
though
i
be
never
formally
an
employee
or
anything
i
be
just
do
my
software
stuff
i
have
some
thought
on
how
it
ought
to
be
run
so
we
d
all
sit
around
and
talk
about
this
stuff
and
people
would
actually
kind
of
egg
me
on
to
stand
up
to
ed
we
always
thought
we
might
do
something
to
improve
the
way
thing
be
run
the
company
s
foul
ups
drove
the
business
mind
gate
up
the
wall
especially
the
problem
mit
be
have
with
dynamic
memory
board
for
the
altair
these
high
tech
circuit
board
give
the
altair
enough
brain
power
to
run
basic
and
be
essential
to
the
sale
of
basic
which
require
a
minimum
of
k
of
memory
but
the
board
seldom
work
gate
write
a
software
program
to
test
the
board
and
didn
t
find
one
that
work
as
advertised
it
be
irritate
as
well
as
an
embarrassment
to
everybody
include
us
say
curry
this
be
particularly
so
since
many
of
the
faulty
memory
board
be
deliver
to
altair
customer
already
frustrate
that
it
have
take
so
long
to
get
one
of
the
computer
kit
other
hardware
company
see
an
opportunity
in
the
young
microcomputer
field
be
soon
make
and
shipping
memory
board
that
do
work
which
irritated
and
embarrass
robert
enormously
gate
rant
and
rave
at
robert
about
the
problem
he
saw
he
and
allen
need
cash
flow
to
fund
their
young
company
s
growth
how
could
they
expect
royalty
from
their
agreement
with
mit
when
thing
at
mit
be
so
screw
up
although
robert
respect
gate
technical
ability
he
didn
t
care
for
gate
confrontational
style
we
get
so
we
didn
t
even
invite
him
to
meeting
where
we
be
try
to
come
up
with
a
new
software
approach
or
something
like
that
because
he
be
impossible
to
deal
with
robert
recall
he
be
a
spoil
kid
he
literally
be
a
spoil
kid
that
s
what
the
problem
be
paul
allen
be
much
more
creative
than
bill
bill
spent
his
whole
time
try
to
be
argumentative
and
not
try
to
come
up
with
solution
paul
be
exactly
the
opposite
at
the
end
of
that
first
summer
in
albuquerque
larson
go
back
to
school
at
lakeside
and
davidoff
return
to
harvard
gate
too
decide
to
go
back
to
harvard
that
fall
he
be
still
wrestling
with
his
future
and
his
parent
continued
to
pressure
him
to
finish
his
education
for
the
next
year
and
a
half
gate
would
divide
his
time
between
school
and
poker
at
harvard
and
create
software
and
negotiate
deal
for
his
new
business
in
albuquerque
with
gate
larson
and
davidoff
back
in
school
allen
be
left
alone
to
deal
with
robert
and
mit
he
have
his
hand
full
mit
have
be
the
first
company
to
hit
the
market
with
an
affordable
microcomputer
but
others
quickly
follow
a
couple
startup
company
be
work
on
a
microcomputer
that
use
motorola
s
new
mc
microchip
instead
of
the
intel
the
mathematical
engine
in
the
altair
robert
want
mit
to
build
a
new
altair
around
the
motorola
chip
allen
argue
otherwise
it
would
mean
rewrite
the
basic
software
and
put
out
compete
hardware
product
in
the
marketplace
but
robert
as
usual
get
his
way
allen
brought
in
richard
weiland
one
of
the
found
member
of
the
lakeside
programmer
group
to
write
the
version
of
basic
mit
later
do
produce
an
altair
know
as
the
b
though
as
allen
have
predict
it
be
not
very
successful
in
late
mit
decide
to
release
a
floppy
disk
storage
system
for
the
altair
as
a
result
allen
as
software
director
be
ask
to
develop
a
disk
basic
quickly
magnetic
disk
that
store
data
have
be
use
for
year
in
mainframe
machine
and
minicomputer
but
it
be
not
until
after
the
altair
hit
the
market
that
floppy
diskette
be
design
for
microcomputer
disk
be
a
much
more
efficient
way
to
store
data
than
paper
tape
even
before
mit
have
announce
its
intention
to
market
a
disk
base
version
of
altair
basic
allen
anticipate
the
need
for
such
a
product
have
ask
gate
to
write
the
new
software
code
but
gate
have
be
busy
on
other
project
and
push
the
request
aside
now
gate
have
no
choice
when
the
fall
semester
end
gate
flew
to
albuquerque
and
checked
into
the
hilton
hotel
with
a
stack
of
yellow
legal
pad
five
day
later
he
emerge
the
yellow
pad
fill
with
the
code
of
the
new
version
of
basic
gate
then
go
to
the
software
lab
at
mit
to
iron
out
the
new
basic
instruct
the
others
that
he
be
to
be
left
alone
in
another
five
day
gate
have
what
would
become
know
as
disk
basic
run
on
the
altair
that
at
least
be
the
official
version
of
chairman
bill
s
feat
of
program
prowess
as
recount
in
the
preface
to
the
company
s
bible
the
m
do
encyclopedia
although
gate
be
generally
thought
of
as
the
father
of
microsoft
basic
which
become
an
industry
standard
and
be
the
foundation
on
which
his
software
company
be
built
there
be
those
in
the
industry
who
believe
allen
deserves
at
least
as
much
credit
as
gate
and
possibly
more
accord
to
them
the
legend
of
gate
have
risen
to
such
olympian
height
that
it
sometimes
overshadows
reality
ed
curry
for
one
felt
allen
never
get
the
credit
he
should
have
for
his
work
on
basic
what
be
deliver
to
us
initially
there
in
albuquerque
say
curry
be
what
come
to
be
know
as
the
k
version
and
it
have
no
file
management
capability
and
be
you
know
very
restrictive
about
as
restrictive
a
subset
of
basic
as
you
could
have
and
still
call
it
basic
it
be
paul
who
begin
to
flesh
it
out
when
you
read
thing
about
bill
write
basic
for
example
to
me
that
s
a
little
bit
of
a
joke
he
be
part
of
a
team
i
think
it
s
accurate
to
say
that
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
basic
three
or
four
year
later
and
say
okay
who
make
the
most
significant
contribution
it
be
paul
allen
the
initial
hack
be
a
very
important
piece
of
work
undoubtedly
it
be
very
challenge
and
very
difficult
but
you
know
i
don
t
want
this
to
come
out
that
i
say
bill
gate
didn
t
write
basic
that
s
not
what
i
m
say
bill
be
part
of
a
team
effort
he
make
very
important
contribution
but
if
any
one
person
be
to
be
say
to
be
the
author
of
basic
i
would
think
it
would
be
paul
if
you
ask
who
be
the
drive
force
behind
basic
it
be
bill
and
paul
if
you
ask
who
solve
the
hard
problem
it
be
bill
and
paul
but
in
term
of
who
sat
down
and
do
the
work
for
basic
as
we
know
it
today
it
s
get
to
be
paul
who
do
the
lion
s
share
those
patient
enough
to
have
actually
receive
an
altair
kit
skilled
enough
to
have
assemble
the
piece
and
lucky
enough
to
have
gotten
the
machine
up
and
run
could
have
care
less
who
author
basic
they
just
want
to
use
it
and
when
they
couldn
t
get
it
many
resort
to
steal
this

version
of

developed
by

and
allen
at
this
point
no
one
at
homebrew
who
have
order
an
altair
have
receive
a
copy
of
basic
though
they
have
sent
mit
their
money
for
the

accord
to
one
account
someone
from
homebrew
picked
up
the
punch
paper

contain
basic
lie
on
the
floor
near
the

someone
else
later
ran

and
at
the

homebrew
meeting
a
large
box
of

pass
out
to
anyone
who
want
one
gradually
then
exponentially
basic
spread
from
computer
club
to
computer
club
like
a
virus
and
no
one
be
pay
for
it
when
gate
learn
what
be
go
on
he
be
beside
himself
no
wonder
he
and
allen
be
receive
so
little
money
from
their
royalty
agreement
with
mit
he
thought
one
day
he
storm
into
robert
office
and
threw
one
of
his
fit
that
many
around
mit
have
become
accustom
to
i
vividly
remember
the
conversation
recall
robert
him
come
into
my
office
that
first
summer
and
scream
and
yell
at
the
top
of
his
lung
that
everyone
be
steal
his
software
and
he
be
never
go
to
make
any
money
and
he
wasn
t
go
to
do
another
thing
unless
we
put
him
on
the
payroll
robert
say
he
put
gate
on
the
company
s
payroll
for
about
a
year
and
paid
him
about
an
hour
gate
however
later
claimed
he
never
work
for
mit
technically
he
be
right
accord
to
david
bunnell
the
salary
gate
receive
for
the
hour
he
work
enhance
and
sell
basic
be
actually
an
advance
against
royalty
he
be
never
on
the
mit
staff
gate
eventually
become
convince
that
basic
wasn
t
sell
very
well
because
so
many
people
have
obtain
copy
without
pay
for
them
at
one
point
frustrate
and
demoralize
gate
offer
to
sell
robert
all
right
and
ownership
to
basic
for
about
in
hindsight
it
would
have
be
the
bonehead
deal
of
the
century
clearly
it
would
have
be
a
bad
decision
on
bill
s
part
because
there
might
not
be
a
microsoft
today
say
eddie
curry
but
robert
decide
not
to
take
gate
up
on
the
offer
he
later
told
curry
that
he
like
both
gate
and
allen
and
didn
t
want
to
take
advantage
of
them
because
they
be
so
young
in
truth
robert
decide
it
make
well
business
sense
to
continue
pay
royalty
to
the
two
and
reap
whatever
benefit
come
from
the
enhancement
they
be
make
with
basic
have
allen
quit
as
mit
software
director
which
he
almost
certainly
would
have
do
if
he
and
gate
no
longer
have
a
financial
interest
in
basic
then
there
would
have
be
no
one
to
make
the
badly
need
upgrade
in
the
language
in
retrospect
say
curry
it
work
out
in
a
way
that
i
don
t
think
ed
be
very
happy
about
today
but
at
the
time
be
the
right
decision
base
on
what
everybody
knew
gate
decide
the
best
thing
he
could
do
to
stop
people
from
steal
his
software
be
to
strike
back
publicly
at
the
thief
he
ask
bunnell
to
publish
a
letter
in
the
altair
newsletter
computer
note
entitle
an
open
letter
to
hobbyist
gate
note
that
the
most
important
thing
inhibit
computer
hobbyist
be
the
lack
of
good
software
almost
a
year
ago
paul
allen
and
myself
expect
the
hobby
market
to
expand
hire
monte
davidoff
and
developed
altair
basic
though
the
initial
work
take
only
two
month
the
three
of
us
have
spent
most
of
the
last
year
document
improve
and
add
feature
to
basic
now
we
have
k
k
extend
rom
and
disk
basic
the
value
of
the
computer
time
we
have
use
exceeds
gate
note
that
while
feedback
from
enthusiast
be
strong
he
d
notice
two
thing
most
of
these
user
never
bought
basic
less
than
percent
of
all
altair
owner
have
bought
basic
and
the
amount
of
royalty
we
have
receive
from
sale
to
hobbyist
make
the
time
spent
on
altair
basic
worth
less
than
an
hour
he
then
accuse
hobbyist
of
steal
software
program
be
this
fair
one
thing
you
don
t
do
by
steal
software
be
get
back
at
mit
for
some
problem
you
may
have
have
mit
doesn
t
make
money
sell
software
the
royalty
paid
to
us
the
manual
the
tape
and
the
overhead
make
it
a
break
even
operation
one
thing
you
can
do
be
prevent
good
software
from
be
write
who
can
afford
to
do
professional
work
for
nothing
the
fact
be
no
one
besides
us
have
invest
a
lot
of
money
in
hobby
software
but
there
be
very
little
incentive
to
make
this
software
available
to
hobbyist
he
go
on
to
add
that
those
who
resell
basic
software
give
hobbyist
a
bad
name
and
should
be
kick
out
of
any
club
meeting
they
show
up
at
i
would
appreciate
letter
from
anyone
who
want
to
pay
up
or
have
a
suggestion
or
comment
nothing
would
please
me
more
than
be
able
to
hire
ten
programmer
and
deluge
the
hobby
market
with
good
software
the
letter
be
publish
on
february
bunnell
not
only
print
the
diatribe
in
the
altair
newsletter
but
he
make
sure
it
ran
in
most
of
the
major
industry
publication
include
the
newsletter
of
the
homebrew
computer
club
gate
letter
cause
quite
a
stir
the
southern
california
computer
society
which
have
be
visit
by
the
mit
mobile
in
early
and
by
now
have
several
thousand
member
threaten
to
sue
him
they
be
upset
that
gate
have
call
them
thief
say
bunnell
they
be
not
all
thief
just
most
of
them
only
a
handful
of
people
who
possess
pirate
copy
of
basic
sent
gate
money
as
he
have
ask
them
to
do
in
his
letter
some
fire
off
their
own
angry
letter
in
return
what
be
the
difference
between
make
copy
of
basic
and
tap
music
off
the
air
rather
than
buying
the
record
artist
s
music
some
want
to
know
others
argue
the
altruistic
position
that
basic
belong
in
the
public
domain
an
argument
that
have
some
merit
since
gate
and
allen
have
create
basic
use
the
pdp
at
harvard
a
computer
fund
by
the
defense
advanced
research
project
agency
in
other
word
these
people
argue
the
computer
time
they
have
use
be
paid
for
with
taxpayer
money
regardless
of
what
philosophical
rationalization
hobbyist
use
to
justify
why
they
have
not
paid
for
basic
they
do
have
one
legitimate
beef
mit
be
partly
to
blame
by
engage
in
a
pricing
policy
that
all
but
assure
altair
owner
would
do
anything
possible
to
avoid
pay
for
basic
no
one
want
the
memory
board
mit
be
turn
out
but
everyone
want
basic
so
early
on
the
company
have
decide
to
charge
for
basic
alone
about
a
hundred
dollar
more
than
the
altair
itself
cost
but
for
only
a
customer
could
get
a
memory
board
plus
basic
of
course
word
quickly
get
around
that
most
of
the
board
didn
t
work
and
mit
knew
this
which
be
why
it
price
basic
out
of
reach
of
many
hobbyist
mit
be
force
customer
who
want
basic
to
buy
the
atrocious
circuit
board
gate
do
not
stop
the
antipiracy
campaign
with
his

out
on
the

later
robert
publish
his
own
diatribe
in

describe
processor
technology

other
company
who
dare
produce

he
only
damage
himself
in

far
the
three
day
convention
which
include
guide
tour
of
mit
be
more
of
a

there
be
no

in
the
penthouse

most
session
be
held
in
a
large
room
in
the
hotel
where
attendee
listen
to
speech
and
talk
about
microcomputer
when
gate
spoke
his
speech
be
another
belligerent
attack
on
those
hobbyist
who
he
say
be
rip
off
his
software
at
the
time
gate
be
fairly
unknown
in
the
industry
he
be
well
know
as
the
author
of
the
scathing
letter
in
computer
note
than
as
the
author
of
basic
now
twenty
year
old
he
look
more
like
fourteen
his
hair
be
uncombed
and
hung
helter
skelter
over
his
eyebrow
and
ear
and
his
thick
oversized
glass
accentuate
his
childlike
appearance
his
high
pitch
voice
underscored
his
youthfulness
but
gate
do
have
a
certain
charisma
his
word
crackle
with
the
authority
of
someone
much
old
and
wiser
after
his
talk
people
crowd
around
him
to
ask
question
although
he
come
off
as
brash
and
arrogant
to
many
gate
do
have
his
supporter
i
be
very
much
in
sympathy
with
his
attitude
recall
winkle
the
personal
compute
magazine
editor
how
do
you
get
your
investment
back
robert
later
ask
his
friend
eddie
curry
to
talk
with
gate
and
persuade
him
to
write
a
second
letter
in
the
hope
of
undo
some
of
the
public
relation
damage
robert
have
be
furious
with
gate
over
the
first
letter
because
it
have
be
write
on
the
mit
stationery
it
look
like
we
be
accuse
all
our
customer
of
be
crook
i
be
very
very
upset
robert
say
gate
acknowledge
that
he
have
make
a
mistake
by
use
mit
letterhead
and
he
agree
to
work
with
curry
on
a
suitable
second
letter
in
retrospect
it
really
didn
t
help
anything
to
accuse
people
of
be
thief
say
curry
all
it
do
be
to
work
against
bill
he
didn
t
feel
he
have
do
some
terrible
thing
but
in
the
calm
light
of
day
he
understood
it
be
not
the
most
prudent
thing
to
have
do
gate
subsequent
effort
entitle
a
second
and
final
letter
ran
in
the
altair
newsletter
in
april
since
send
out
my
open
letter
to
hobbyist
of
february
rd
i
have
have
innumerable
reply
and
an
opportunity
to
speak
directly
with
hobbyist
editor
and
mit
employee
at
mit
world
altair
computer
convention
march
gate
write
i
be
surprised
at
the
wide
coverage
give
the
letter
and
i
hope
it
mean
that
serious
consideration
be
be
give
to
the
issue
of
the
future
of
software
development
and
distribution
for
the
hobbyist
gate
then
go
on
to
say
unfortunately
some
of
the
controversy
raise
by
my
letter
focus
upon
me
personally
and
even
more
inappropriately
upon
mit
i
be
not
a
mit
employee
and
perhaps
no
one
at
mit
agrees
with
me
absolutely
but
i
believe
all
be
glad
to
see
the
issue
i
raise
discuss
the
three
negative
letter
i
receive
object
to
the
fact
that
state
that
a
large
percentage
of
computer
hobbyist
have
steal
software
in
their
possession
my
intent
be
to
indicate
that
a
significant
number
of
the
copy
of
basic
currently
in
use
be
not
obtain
legitimately
and
not
to
issue
a
blanket
indictment
of
computer
hobbyist
on
the
contrary
i
find
the
majority
be
intelligent
and
honest
individual
who
share
my
concern
for
the
future
of
software
development
perhaps
the
present
dilemma
have
result
from
a
failure
by
many
to
realize
that
neither
microsoft
nor
anyone
else
can
develop
extensive
software
without
a
reasonable
return
on
the
huge
investment
in
time
that
be
necessary
gate
end
by
say
he
consider
the
pirate
matter
close
he
predict
basic
would
become
the
foundation
for
the
development
of
new
and
excite
application
program
for
microcomputer

write
in

eight
frantic

in

to
the

so
bitterly
denounce

the
others
already
work

he
be
a

old
than
allen

weiland
after
wood
interviewed
for
the

and
return

with
an

he

threw
their

head
for

microsoft
have
just
rent
its
first
office
on
the
eighth
floor
of
a
bank
building
near
the
airport
the
address
two
park
central

would
be
microsoft

home
for
the
next
two
and
a
half
year
although
microsoft
now
have
office
it
do
not
have
its
own

instead
the

contract
to
timeshare
with
the
albuquerque
city
school
which
use
a
dec
pdp

microsoft

work
at
so
call
dumb

without
a

and
each
day
someone
have
to
go
down
to
the
school
administration
building
and
pick
up
computer
printout
gate
and
allen
have
decide
that
fortran
be
the
next
high
level
language
to
develop
as
microsoft
expand
its
product
line
when
wood
and
chu
arrive
they
immediately
go
to
work
write
fortran
code
for
the
microchip
at
the
time
fortran
be
probably
the
second
most
popular
computer
language
after
basic
this
strategy
of
anticipate
the
market
and
be
the
first
out
with
a
new
product
be
a
competitive
edge
microsoft
would
hone
in
the
year
ahead
allen
even
more
than
gate
have
a
knack
for
figure
out
the
direction
of
the
industry
three
or
four
year
down
the
road
the
question
constantly
before
the
young
company
be
whether
microsoft
should
invest
in
this
product
or
that
product
this
set
of
software
feature
or
that
set
of
feature
gate
and
allen
have
to
determine
where
the
market
be
head
what
the
technology
would
be
like
microsoft
definitely
have
a
vision
of
where
it
want
to
go
it
s
very
broad
compare
to
some
company
that
have
a
narrow
focus
on
only
one
product
say
allen
later
part
of
this
go
back
to
when
bill
and
i
be
work
on
new
language
in
albuquerque
every
time
there
be
a
new
language
we
thought
be
go
to
be
popular
we
d
see
that
as
another
possible
market
for
our
software
technology
in
late
microsoft
land
its
two
big
customer
and
most
lucrative
account
to
date
national
cash
register
and
general
electric
both
want
basic
general
electric
only
want
to
buy
the
source
code
but
ncr
need
a
digital
cassette
basic
that
would
work
with
its
file
system
that
job
be
give
to
marc
mcdonald
who
later
developed
what
become
know
as
stand
alone
disk
basic
for
ncr
it
be
one
of
microsoft
s
most
successful
and
important
software
product
to
date
although
gate
rather
than
mcdonald
would
get
the
credit
allen
remain
as
mit
software
director
until
november
when
he
quit
to
work
fulltime
for
microsoft
the
company
be
grow
fast
revenue
for
its
first
full
year
be
more
than
this
be
expect
to
triple
in
the
next
year
thing
be
work
out
just
as
allen
and
gate
have
imagine
that
summer
at
trw
in
vancouver
when
they
talk
about
one
day
own
a
software
company
in
january
of
two
month
after
allen
quit
mit
gate
drop
out
of
harvard
this
time
for
good
sam
znaimer
who
have
room
with
gate
when
they
be
freshman
recall
that
gate
told
him
shortly
before
he
left
school
that
he
have
come
to
harvard
because
he
be
look
for
people
smarter
than
he
be
he
told
me
he
have
not
found
them
znaimer
say
i
think
bill
just
get
bore
but
andy
braiterman
who
be
room
with
gate
at
the
end
say
gate
realize
even
he
have
limitation
bill
be
try
to
do
too
much
he
really
do
have
a
sense
that
thing
be
out
of
control
he
didn
t
have
time
for
both
his
business
and
school
not
to
mention
try
to
keep
up
with
poker
play
he
be
really
worn
out
by
the
end
if
he
have
stayed
in
school
it
would
have
be
a
tremendous
mistake
because
braiterman
have
enter
harvard
as
a
sophomore
he
graduate
at
the
same
time
gate
drop
out
during
their
final
semester
together
they
have
talk
often
about
computer
and
the
future
bill
be
one
of
the
first
people
i
ever
knew
who
really
have
this
concept
of
computer
be
everywhere
say
braiterman
he
saw
that
as
be
the
future
i
m
not
sure
he
really
saw
thing
quite
the
way
they
turn
out
though
he
saw
personal
computer
as
be
omnipresent
in
people
s
home
as
oppose
to
office
but
he
be
clearly
think
in
the
right
direction
he
also
talk
to
me
about
the
concept
of
everyone
be
able
to
discard

someday
after

put
all
his
considerable

there
be
no
more
distraction
to
divert
his
focus
from
the
company
over
the
next
five
year
in
fact
he
would
take
only
two
vacation
of
a
few
day
each
the
most
press
problem
at
microsoft
when
he
arrive
in
albuquerque
in
january
of
be
the
business
relationship
with

which
he
found
more
and
more
frustrate
there
be
so
much
money
to
be
make
he
felt
be
it
not
for
the
fact
that
microsoft
be
still
a
legal
and
financial
captive
of
mit
the
impose
figure
of
ed
robert
have
cast
a
giant
shadow
over
microsoft
s
otherwise
bright
future
the
licensing
agreement
with
mit
prevent
microsoft
from
sell
basic
to
company
without
the
approval
of
mit
robert
have
say
he
would
not
block
a
sale
unless
it
be
to
a
competitor
this
be
not
a
problem
at
first
because
the
altair
have
no
rival
but
within
two
year
of
the
popular
electronics
article
dozen
of

in
the
silicon

the

the

ii
the

a

microsoft
that
allow
computer

to
utilize
their

more
effectively
stood
to
reap
a
financial
harvest
while
gate
look
at
these
new
computer
hardware
company
and
saw
new
market
for
microsoft
s
product
robert
saw
them
as
a
threat
inevitably
he
and
gate
be
head
for
a
collision
although
the
two
have
argue
yell
and
scream
at
each
other
almost
since
the
day
they
met
two
year
earlier
robert
realize
he
be
dependent
on
gate
have
the
young
software
creator
left
mit
and
take
allen
with
him
mit
would
have
be
in
serious
trouble
particularly
if
microsoft
forge
an
alliance
with
a
new
hardware
company
so
there
be
limit
on
how
far
robert
could
go
in
argue
with
gate
on
the
other
hand
gate
knew
robert
be
not
his
equal
when
it
come
to
understand
computer
software
arguably
no
one
be
part
of
the
problem
for
robert
in
deal
with
gate
be
that
gate
knew
he
be
good
and
at
time
he
could
be
obnoxious
he
do
not
hesitate
to
call
someone
stupid
or
an
idiot
include
robert
one
heat
blow
up
between
the
two
have
occur
in
when
a
company
call
intelligent
system
corporation
approach
mit
about
licensing
basic
robert
consider
the
firm
a
competitor
and
jacked
the
price
of
basic
up
so
high
that
the
deal
fell
through
later
that
year
microsoft
negotiate
deal
for
basic
with
several
other
company
include
zilog
and
rydacom
zilog
have
recently
come
out
with
the
z
microchip
which
be
a
clone
of

but
once
again
robert
interfere
refuse
to
sign
licensing
agreement
by
early
gate
tireless
salesmanship
browbeating
and
haggle
have
result
in
tentative
agreement
to
license
basic
to
a
number
of
computer
company

add
delta

courier
control

lexar
astro
rand
lawrence
livermore
isyx
and
magnavox
microsoft
and
mit
stood
to
make
more
than
each
but
robert
again
refuse
to
sign
the
agreement
a
letter
robert
sent
to
add
apply
digital
data
system
be
typical
of
his
position
during
our
recent
discussion
involve
the
potential
of
grant
add
a
license
to
market
mit
extend
basic
we
be
have
difficulty
establish
term
that
would
mutually
satisfy
the
long
range
marketing
objective
of
both
company
after
far
consideration
of
the
potential
problem
we
feel
that
it
be
in
the
best
interest
of
both
add
and
mit
to
discontinue
our
effort
to
try
to
enter
into
a
license
agreement
robert
go
on
to
note
that
add
should
be
aware
that
mit
hold
exclusive
right
to
the
basic
software
program
developed
by
mr
gate
and
his
partner
and
that
any
commitment
regard
the
right
to
the
basic
program
or
any
modify
version
or
portion
of
it
by
anyone
other
than
mit
personnel
be
not
authorize
robert
also
fire
off
a
letter
to
microsoft
notify
gate
and
allen
that
he
have
told
add
and
delta
data
that
mit
would
not
license
basic
to
them
because
of
market
conflict
robert
also
add
in
his
letter
all
other
third
party
deal
e
g
intel
motorola
etc
appear
to
be
at
a
standstill
due
to
a
variety
of
reason
let
me
again
reiterate
my
desire
that
you
not
contact
directly
any
potential
third
party
customer
without
our
approval
and
involvement
microsoft
face
an
even
more
serious
problem
robert
be
think
of
sell
mit
and
move
to
georgia
to
buy
a
farm
the
likely
buyer
pertec
a
company
specialize
in
disk
and
tape
drive
for
microcomputer
and
mainframe
computer
have
make
it
clear
that
the
licensing
agreement
with
microsoft
be
part
of
any
sale
mit
have
gross
about
million
in
but
the
altair
which
have
go
supernova
be
now
a
collapse
star
without
the
licensing
agreement
mit
have
little
value
basic
not
the
altair
be
the
mit
cash
cow
when
gate
learn
of
the
pending
sale
he
knew
he
and
allen
have
to
do
whatever
it
take
to
get
basic
back
since
signing
the
agreement
with
mit
gate
and
allen
have
receive
almost
in
royalty
include
roughly
for
the
licensing
of
basic
when
accompany
with
the
sale
of
mit
hardware
from
the
licensing
of
basic
without
the
sale
of
hardware
and
from
the
licensing
of
the
basic
source
code
because
the
agreement
provide
for
a
royalty
cap
microsoft
could
not
make
much
more
money
from
basic
unless
they
could
break
away
from
mit
on
april
after
consult
with
gate
father
in
seattle
and
hire
an
attorney
in
albuquerque
gate
and
allen
notify
robert
by
letter
that
they
be
terminate
the
licensing
agreement
for
basic
effective
in
ten
day
they
cite
several
reason
mit
have
fail
to
account
for
thousand
of
dollar
in
royalty
payment
fail
to
make
its
best
effort
to
promote
and
commercialize
basic
and
fail
to
secure
secrecy
agreement
when
basic
be
license
to
certain
third
party
mostly
hobbyist
the
licensing
agreement
require
that
any
dispute
that
arose
would
be
settle
by
arbitration
but
a
couple
week
after
receive
microsoft
s
letter
robert
file
for
a
restrain
order
in
bernalillo

a
judge
grant
his
motion
until
the
licensing
dispute
be
resolve
microsoft
could
not
license
its
basic
robert

he
go
to

when
he
found
out
microsoft
be
negotiate
to
license
basic
to
texas
instrument
which
be
about
to
come
out
with
a
microcomputer
of
its
own
texas
instrument
of
course
have
help
to
undercut
the
market
when
mit
be
a
struggle
calculator
kit
company
it
would
take
several
month
to
resolve
the
matter
and
for
what
would
be
the
only
time
in
the
company
s
history
microsoft
face
money
problem
it
be
tough
that
spring
and
summer
recall
steve
wood
there
wasn
t
any
revenue
come
in
we
have
a
little
come
in
from
fortran
which
we
have
just
start
shipping
and
we
have
a
little
come
in
from
and
version
of
basic
but
those
be
not
huge
revenue
stream
on
may
robert
sell
mit
to
pertec
it
be
essentially
a
stock
swap
robert
walk
away
with
several
million
dollar
worth
of
pertec
stock
when
the
chief
counsel
for
pertec
come
to
albuquerque
to
ass
the
situation
and
talk
with
gate
he
take
one
look
at
the
long
haired
scraggly
year
old
and
decide
the
legal
battle
against
microsoft
be
go
to
be
easy
robert
have
warn
pertec
that
it
would
have
its
corporate
hand
full
with
gate
but
no
one
listen
to
him
pertec
kept
tell
me
i
be
be
unreasonable
and
they
could
deal
with
this
guy
robert
say
it
be
a
little
like
roosevelt
tell
churchill
that
he
could
deal
with
stalin
eddie
curry
talk
gate
into
meeting
with
robert
and
the
pertec
lawyer
they
gather
in
a
conference
room
at
mit
while
curry
wait
outside
within
minute
he
could
hear
the
three
scream
and
shout
curry
be
worried
that
gate
be
take
a
real
beating
he
place
a
frantic
call
to
allen
over
at
microsoft
advise
him
to
phone
gate
and
tell
him
they
need
to
discus
an
urgent
business
matter
it
be
a
ruse
to
get
gate
out
of
the
room
allen
make
the
call
and
rush
over
to
mit
to
wait
for
gate
to
come
out
curry
recall
that
when
gate
emerge
bill
told
paul
in
a
very
loud
voice
something
like
these
guy
think
they
ve
get
me
over
a
barrel
but
i
m
hold
my
own
and
then
he
go
right
back
in
well
i
didn
t
worry
about
him
after
that
it
be
obvious
that
talk
wasn
t
go
to
settle
thing
the
dispute
finally
go
to
arbitration
in
addition
to
underestimate
gate
pertec
make
another
mistake
the
company
write
a
very
explicit
letter
to
microsoft
say
it
would
no
longer
market
basic
or
allow
it
to
be
license
because
it
consider
all
other
hardware
company
competitor
the
letter
turn
out
to
be
the
key
piece
of
evidence
in
the
arbitration
hearing
in
that
it
go
completely
counter
to
the
best
effort
provision
in
the
licensing
agreement
it
weaken
their
case
say
wood
they
come
in
very
arrogant
essentially
say
we
be
this
huge
multimillion
dollar
company
and
you
be
just
a
handful
of
kid
and
we
be
not
go
to
take
you
seriously
and
that
be
a
big
mistake
the
hearing
go
on
for
three
week
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
about
five
at
night
each
day
it
look
like
big
giant
pertec
be
pick
on
these
poor
nineteen
and
twenty
year
old
guy
and
try
to
steal
their
life
s
work
say
robert
that
s
how
they
played
it
and
it
played
pretty
well
i
told
pertec
they
need
to
deal
with
gate
hard
but
they
didn
t
it
be
a
fatal
mistake
it
turn
out
he
won
everything
it
be
a
complex
and
highly
technical
case
if
the
arbitrator
have
have
to
decide
the
dispute
base
on
his
understand
of
the
technology
microsoft
might
still
be
wait
for
a
ruling
i
don
t
think
he
have
a
clue
to
what
anybody
be
talk
about
say
curry
instead
the
arbitrator
rule
on
the
legal
merit
microsoft
he
decide
own
the
right
to
basic
and
could
market
the
product
as
it
saw
fit
if
pertec
have
prevail
there
might
not
be
a
microsoft
today
say
david
bunnell
whether
gate
be
right
or
wrong
it
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
pc
business
that
he
prevail
after
the
pertec
decision
come
down
and
the
log
jam
of
customer
wait
for
basic
broke
loose
microsoft
never
have
to
worry
about
money
again
ed
robert
stayed
on
with
pertec
for
a
couple
year
then
return
to
his
mother
s
birthplace

the
quiet
heart
of
georgia
where
he
use
some
of
his
new
wealth
to
buy
a
farm
a
few
year
later
he
sell
the
farm
and
enter
medical
school
he
have
always
want
to
be
a
doctor
today
he
s
a
family
physician
in
cochran
a
town
of

few
of
the
townspeople

that
robert
once
built
a
tiny
computer
call
the
altair
which
shone
like
a
christmas
star
in
the
night
sky
during
the
early
day
of
the
personal
computer
revolution
a
dozen
year
after
the
light
go
out
and
robert
left
albuquerque
he
be
still
bitter
when
he
talk
about
gate
perhaps
because
gate
go
on
to
such
great
success
while
robert
become
something
of
a
robert
goddard
the
scientist
who
laid
the
foundation
of
modern
rocketry
and
then
be
all
but
forgotten
by
history
the
world
will
never
appreciate
what
ed
robert
do
for
the
computer
industry
say
his
friend
eddie
curry
robert
still
maintains
that
mit
be
the
rightful
owner
of
the
basic
that
help
make
gate
a
billionaire
several
time
over
he
do
not
dispute
that
gate
and
allen
be
the
author
but
mit
he
say
foot
the
bill
for
the
development
cost
that
turn
basic
into
a
marketable
product
for
microcomputer
he
estimate
that
gate
and
allen
use
several
hundred
thousand
dollar
worth
of
compute
time
while
work
on
basic
at
mit
i
be
naive
robert
say
it
sound
self
serve
now
but
i
be
really
concerned
with
not
try
to
screw
those
guy
bill
be
only
and
allen
only
a
couple
year
old
but
it
turn
out
they
be
a
lot
old
than
i
be
bill
be
for
sure
paul
be
a
totally
honorable
guy
what
ed
robert
understood
and
pertec
learn
the
hard
way
be
that
bill
gate
look
be
deceive
although
he
look
more
like
a
stockroom
office
boy
than
a
corporate
executive
gate
prove
himself
to
be
a
formidable
businessman
at
age
he
be
as
comfortable
sit
in
his
office
negotiate
tough
deal
with
much
old
executive
in
three
piece
suit
as
he
be
program
long
into
the
night
in
front
of
a
computer
terminal
eat
cold
pizza
and
swig
down
coke
the
skinny
kid
with
the
dandruff
and
uncombed
mop
haircut
not
only
understood
software
as
few
in
the
industry
do
but
he
have
the
business
and
marketing
savvy
to
run
a
very
profitable
company
in
a
highly
competitive
environment
he
understood
the
underlie
issue
in
negotiation
that
be
not
immediately
apparent
and
he
be
confident
that
he
could
handle
them
correctly
give
his
white
hot
drive
and
his
determination
to
trounce
the
opposition
to
do
whatever
have
to
be
do
to
dominate
the
software
market
this
rare
combination
of
technical
genius
and
managerial
acumen
be
an
unbeatable
combination
steve
wood
recall
executive
coin
to
albuquerque
and
be
take
back
by
the
long
haired
microkids
their
reaction
be
who
be
these
kid
where
s
their
leader
then
bill
would
take
charge
of
the
meeting
and
within
ten
minute
that
wouldn
t
be
an
issue
anymore
typically
these
business
meeting
be
held
with
men
in
their
thirty
and
forty
who
come
dress
in
conservative
business
attire
with
important
visitor
some
of
the
microsoft
programmer
would
wear
slack
instead
of
jean
and
try
to
get
marc
mcdonald
to
wear
shoe
instead
of
sandal
but
that
be
the
extent
of
their
effort
to
conform
to
formal
business
etiquette
look
back
on
it
now
that
must
have
be
pretty
funny
say
wood
but
at
the
time
we
pretty
much
ignore
it
we
didn
t
even
think
about
it
we
have
the
product
these
guy
need
and
want
we
thought
we
knew
what
they
need
to
do
in
term
of
their
product
development
strategy
and
their
hardware
and
we
felt
we
understood
that
well
than
most
of
them
do
and
we
told
them
that
and
we
just
kind
of
expect
they
would
listen
and
pay
attention
and
for
the
most
part
they
do
although
the
legal
battle
with
mit
and
pertec
last
throughout
much
of
the
pace
of
work
at
microsoft
never
slow
the
company
work
on
new
language
such
as
cobol
and
continued
to
market
fortran
as
well
as
basic
for
chip
other
than
the
gate
spent
much
of
his
time
farm
the
oem
market
an
oem
or
original
manufacturer
be
the
brand
name
under
which
a
product
be
sell
when
a
car
buyer
purchase
a
general
motor
car
with
goodyear
tire
general
motor
be
the
oem
because
it
buy
the
tire
to
use
on
equipment
general
motor
sell
in
the
case
of
the
computer
industry
an
oem
would
buy
a
computer
from
another
manufacturer
build
it
into
their
own
equipment
and
then
sell
the
complete
package
ready
to
run
many
oems
for
example
make
high
tech
computer
equipment
for
hospital
such
as
image
system
others
specialized
in
graphic
or
robotics
but
they
all
need
a
high
level
language
such
as
basic
or
fortran
for
their
machine
it
be
a
very
lucrative
market
and
microsoft
receive
a
substantial
portion
of
its
early
revenue
from
contract
with
oems
while
gate
cut
the
oem
deal
allen
concentrate
on
program
and
figure
out
what
need
to
be
do
next
it
be
a
synergistic
relationship
i
always
focus
on
new
idea
and
create
new
technology
allen
say
bill
would
occasionally
jump
in
and
get
involve
in
that
but
he
be
always
more
focus
on
the
business
side
more
attract
to
the
business
relationship

more
than
the
lawyer
do
not
only
do
gate
understand
what
need
to
be
do
but
he
be

save
microsoft
expensive
expert
legal
advice

the
technical

the

you

set
the

standard
with
its

and
that
s
exactly
what
gate
have
want
what
he
push
for
in
meeting
with
his
program
team
we
set
the
standard
become
the
company
s
motto
in
albuqueque
it
represent
gate
basic
business
philosophy
of
course
try
to
be
first
out
of
the
gate
with
a
new
software
product
just
to
create
an
industry
standard
sometimes
cause
problem
too
often
gate
set
unrealistic
goal
for
product
development
deadline
be
miss
product
weren
t
always
well
design
and
contract
have
to
be
revise
due
to
unforeseen
obstacle
or
delay
bill
s
approach
and
you
can
still
see
it
now
in
thing
like
window
be
always
to
go
for
create
a
standard
to
get
the
market
share
say
wood
he
just
hat
to
turn
down
business
if
it
meant
we
have
to
drop
our
price
to
get
the
business
he
be
typically
much
more
willing
to
argue
that
we
do
that
in
albuquerque
whenever
we
have
pricing
discussion
or
argument
the
way
we
would
decide
how
much
to
charge
an
oem
customer
be
we
would
sit
down
and
say
okay
what
be
they
ask
for
how
long
be
it
go
to
take
us
to
do
that
of
course
we
would
always
underestimate
that
then
we
d
sit
down
and
say
okay
how
much
do
we
think
these
guy
will
pay
how
much
can
we
get
out
of
these
guy
how
much
be
reasonable
to
expect
them
to
pay
how
bad
do
we
want
this
business
bill
would
always
be
argue
for
a
low
price
and
a
more
aggressive
schedule
oh
we
can
do
that
in
three
month
let
s
just
charge
them
fifty
thousand
because
we
really
want
to
get
the
contract
paul
would
argue
for
a
high
price
say
let
s
try
and
get
more
money
from
these
guy
we
usually
end
up
somewhere
in
between
although
gate
spent
most
of
his
time
take
care
of
business
he
still
involve
himself
with
some
of
the
technical
work
at
microsoft
he
love
program
and
would
compete
with
his
employee
occasionally
participate
in
some
of
the
informal
contest
the
microkids
held
to
see
who
could
write
a
program
in
the
few
line
in
the
book
programmer
at
work
gate
be
quote
as
say
in
the
first
four
year
of
the
company
there
be
no
microsoft
program
that
i
wasn
t
involve
in
actually
write
and
design
in
all
those
initial
product
whether
it
be
basic
fortran
basic
or
basic
not
a
line
of
code
go
out
that
i
didn
t
look
over
gate
acknowledge
his
style
rubbed
some
of
his
programmer
the
wrong
way
it
s
kind
of
painful
sometimes
if
you
have
somebody
else
work
on
the
project
they
never
code
stuff
exactly
the
same
way
you
like
to
see
it
cod
i
remember
when
we
be
work
on
basic
i
d
go
back
and
recode
other
people
s
section
of
code
without
make
any
dramatic
improvement
that
bother
people
when
you
go
in
and
do
that
but
sometimes
you
just
feel
like
you
have
to
do
it
it
be
bad
enough
that
gate
rewrote
other
programmer
code
but
at
least
once
he
also
get
credit
for
their
work
when
microsoft
publish
the
m
do
encyclopedia
the
preface
to
this
huge
technical
manual
credit
gate
for
develop
standalone
disk
basic
in
fact
the
program
be
developed
by
marc
mcdonald
for
national
cash
register
in
mcdonald
have
since
left
the
company
but
when
he
read
the
preface
he
fire
off
a
blistering
letter
to
gate
when
i
saw
that
in
the
do
encyclopedia
mcdonald
recall
i
say
to
myself
what
be
this
bullshit
bill
knew
damn
well
i
do
that
the
disk
basic
developed
by
mcdonald
use
a
revolutionary
file
management
technique
know
as
the
fat
or
file
allocation
table
accord
to
mcdonald
gate
do
not
write
any
of
the
code
for
standalone
disk
basic
it
be
much
faster
and
more
efficient
than
the
disk
basic
gate
write
for
the
altair
while
hole
up
for
five
day
at
the
hilton
hotel
in
albuquerque
bill
have
a
very
convenient
memory
mcdonald
say
of
gate
subsequent
edition
of
the
encyclopedia
give
mcdonald
rather
than
gate
credit
for
stand
alone
disk
basic
before
he
left
microsoft
mcdonald
help
develop
a
version
of

that
be
widely

well
gate
begin
to
go
aggressively
after
the
japanese
market
in
and
get
a
huge
jump
on
the
competition
i
go
into
japan
only
two
year
after
i
start
microsoft
know
that
in
term
of
work
with
hardware
company
that
be
a
great
place
to
be
he
say
a
lot
of

it
s
a
difficult

some
catch
on
after

with
his

remember
each
correct
answer
from
a
previous
roll
by
another

it
be
quite
a
feat
of

although
the
office
atmosphere

casual
it
could
also
be
confrontational
gate
be
very
demand
and
the
work
be
intense
bill
be
always
push
say
one
programmer
we
d
do
something
i
thought
be
very
clever
and
he
would
say
why
didn
t
you
do
this
or
why
didn
t
you
do
that
two
day
ago
that
would
get
frustrate
sometimes
but
the
microkids
expect
to
be
challenged
and
they
expect
to
be
able
to
challenge
gate
in
fact
he
want
them
to
argue
with
him
his
confrontational
style
of
management
help
microsoft
maintain
its
edge
its
mental
toughness
it
make
those
who
work
for
him
think
thing
through
these
be
quality
that
continue
to
distinguish
microsoft
to
this
day
it
be
a
culture
that
never
give
employee
a
chance
to
get
complacent
because
as
soon
as
they
do
someone
be
go
to
challenge
them
gate
be
not
afraid
to
change
his
mind
if
someone
make
a
convincing
argument
a
quality
that
steve
wood
come
to
admire
bill
be
not
dogmatic
about
thing
he
s
very
pragmatic
wood
say
he
can
be
extremely
vocal
and
persuasive
in
argue
one
side
of
an
issue
and
a
day
or
two
later
he
will
say
he
be
wrong
and
let
s
get
on
with
it
there
be
not
that
many
people
who
have
the
drive
and
the
intensity
and
the
entrepreneurial
quality
to
be
that
successful
who
also
have
the
ability
to
put
their
ego
aside
that
s
a
rare
trait
because
the
albuquerque
school
computer
would
get
busy
in
the
afternoon
and
the
response
time
be
so
terrible
most
of
the
microkids
work
late
into
the
night
the
work
ethic
at
microsoft
do
not
come
from
gate
it
be
self
impose
there
be
an
unstated
expectation
that
the
kid
would
work
as
many
hour
as
it
take
to
get
the
job
do
there

for
another

or
get
a

we
notice
the

hour
but
it
wasn
t
a
burden
it
be
fun
we
weren
t
do
it
because
someone

over
us
with
a

you

allen
saw
every

movie
that
come
out
murder
mystery
be
their
favorite
and
they
compete

of
what
it
can

say
allen
but
he
s
an
incredible
driver
he
would
push
thing
to
the
limit
but
he
be
always
in
control
during
the
summer
of
gate
often
go
out
at
a
m

abandon
cement
plant
here
the
finely
tune
engine
of
the
green
porsche
could
often
be
heard
whine
into
the
desert
night
as
gate
smoothly
negotiate
one
curve
after
another
with
each
high
pitch
shift
of
gear
on
one
of
these

summer
ride
with

he
spun
out
and
the

crashed
into
a
dirt
embankment
the
way
chris
described
it
say
steve
wood
they
be
go
about
mile
an
hour
forward
and
then
they
be
go
sideways
neither

nor
larson
be
injured
and
there
be
only
minor
damage
to
the
car
larson

on
late
night
shenanigan
at
a
road
construction
site
east
of
albuquerque
in
the
sandia
foothill
where
unsuspecting
worker
would
leave
the
key
in
the
heavy
equipment
when
they
go
home
for
the
day
gate
and
larson
would
sneak
into
the
site
and
by
trial
and
error
they
learn
to
operate
the
complex
machinery
and
drive
it
around
the
site
usually
it
be
by
error
gate
once
come
within
a
few
inch
of
backing
over
his
porsche
with
a
bulldozer
after
they
master
the
machinery
there
be
the
usual
friendly
competition
one
night
gate
and
larson
held
a
bulldozer
race
engine
rev
stack
belching
black
smoke
determine
to
find
out
whose

be
faster
neither
would
claim
to
be
the
winner
the
bulldozer
race
become
part
of
microsoft
folklore
i
kept
think
one
of
these
day
we
would
get
a
phone
call
in
the
morning
and
have
to
go
bail
him
out
of
jail
say
wood
the
new
mexico
desert
around
albuquerque
may
have
be
an
ideal
place
for
late
night
drive
in
fast
car
but
it
be
a
bad
location
for
a
fast
grow
software
company
like
microsoft
toward
the
end
of
gate
allen
and
wood
who
be
now
general
manager
talk
about
move
the
company
the
question
be
where
the
silicon
valley
south
of
san
francisco
which
have
give
birth
to
the
semiconductor
industry
be
one
obvious
choice
it
be
now
the
heart
of
the
new
microcomputer
industry
the
world
capital
of
high
technology
synonymous
with
bright
idea
overnight
millionaire
and
smart
upstart
company
like
apple
hardly
a
week
go
by
without
another
silicon
valley
computer
company
opening
its
door
for
business
or
go
public
we
talk
for
quite
a
while
about
whether
we
should
move
to
the
bay
area
recall
wood
there
be
very
little
discussion
about
whether
we
be
go
to
move
we
knew
we
be
go
to
move
it
be
hard
to
get
people
to
move
down
to
albuquerque
when
we
be
recruiting
it
be
an
inconvenience
to
travel
in
and
out
of
it
be
just
not
the
right
place
to
be
allen
want
to
return
home
to
seattle
after
be
in
the
desert
you
want
to
see
tree
and
water
again
he
say
allen
miss
his
family
as
do
gate
seattle
be
their
home
their
root
they
would
have
no
problem
recruiting
talented
people
to
come
to
the
northwest
and
work
for
microsoft
allen
argue
seattle
be
a
great
place
to
live
besides
with
all
the
rain
it
be
an
ideal
environment
for
creative
programmer
who
have
to
work
indoors
know
that
gate
be
very
close
to
his
family
allen
ask
mary
and
bill
jr
to
work
on
their
son
and
encourage
him
to
move
microsoft
to
seattle
we
talk
for
several
month
about
whether
the
bay
area
or
seattle
be
the
best
place
to
go
say
wood
gate
reportedly
didn
t
care
whether
microsoft
move
to
washington
or
california
as
long
as
the
company
s
continued
growth
be
assure
either
location
seem
fine
with
him
in
the
end
gate
side
with
allen
they
would
head
home
to
seattle
at
the
end
of
it
be
almost
a
year
off
but
a
lot
of
planning
have
to
take
place
first
one
person
who
benefit
from
microsoft
s
decision
to
move
to
seattle
be
bob
wallace
in
late
wallace
be
work
at
a
computer
store
in
seattle
when
he
spot
a
hand
drawn
recruitment
flier
for
microsoft
that
have
be
left
by
paul
allen
on
a
recent
visit
to
seattle
i
figure
every
programmer
in
the
world
must
want
to
work
for
microsoft
because
obviously
they
be
go
to
take
over
the
world
or
i
thought
so
at
that
point
say
wallace
although
wallace
who
be
finish
his
master
s
degree
in
computer
science
at
the
university
of
washington
want
desperately
to
work
for
microsoft
he
didn
t
want
to
leave
seattle
and
move
to
albuquerque
when
allen
told
him
the
company
would
be
move
back
to
seattle
within
a
year
wallace
be
sell
and
allen
be
sell
on
wallace
as
well
wallace
agree
to
start
work
at
microsoft
in
late

put
all
its
early
money
in
cd
in
addition
the
market
in
japan
be
about
to
open
up
since
signing
the
one
page
agreement
with
gate
the
year
before
nishi
have
be
do
missionary
work
in
japan
for
himself
and
microsoft
his
big
sale
come
when
he
convince
kazuya
watanabe
a
manager
with
the
electronics
giant
nec
to
build
japan
s
first
personal
computer
he
then
persuade
watanabe
to
fly
to
albuquerque
in
to
talk
with
gate
and
allen
about
software
for
the
computer
gate
met
him
at
the
airport
in
his
porsche
the
visit
be
short
but
watanabe
be
impressed
with
gate
and
allen
and
the
work
microsoft
have
do
develop
language
for
american
computer
when
he
return
to
tokyo
he
sell
the
nec
executive
on
produce
the
country
s
first
microcomputer
and
convince
them
that
they
should
hire
microsoft
to
supply
the
software
the
nec
pc
debut
the
next
year
within
three
year
virtually
every
brand
of
japanese
computer
available
have
some
form
of
microsoft
software
run
on
it
microsoft
played
a
big
role
in
our
decision
make
watanabe
later
told
the
wall
street
journal
i
always
felt
that
only
young
people
could
develop
software
for
personal
computer
people
with
no
tie
work
with
a
coke
and
a
hamburger
only
such
people
could
make
a
personal
computer
adequate
for
other
young
people
and
that
pretty
much
described
the
atmosphere
watanabe
have
found
at
microsoft
look
back
on
those
time
year
later
wood
try
to
explain
microsoft
s
phenomenal
early
success
it
be
more
the
character
of
the
people
than
any
particular
moment
one
of
the
real
key
and
this
have
always
be
true
of
microsoft
be
we
be
able
to
anticipate
the
market
pretty
effectively
we
be
always
a
year
or
two
ahead
of
where
the
demand
yas
really
go
to
be
but
we
be
generally
guess
right
a
lot
of
it
be
bill
s
and
particularly
paul
s
ability
to
see
where
some
of
the
stuff
be
go
to
go
a
lot
of
people
be
able
to
see
thing
like
that
but
we
have
just
an
enthusiasm
a
real
high
level
of
drive
and
ambition
there
wasn
t
anything
we
couldn
t
do
okay
so
no
one
have
do
this
for
a
personal
computer
before
so
what
we
can
do
it
no
big
deal
and
nobody
even
thought
about
whether
some
of
the
thing
we
be
do
be
feasible
or
not
we
just
say
we
can
do
them
we
overcommitted
ourselves
we
miss
deadline
we
consistently
underestimated
the
time
it
would
take
to
do
a
project
and
we
commit
to
too
many
of
those
project
at
a
time
but
we
always
get
it
do
and
it
generally
tend
to
be
pretty
successful
because
of
that
success
gate
never
have
to
use
his
family
s
wealth
or
venture
capital
to
bankroll
the
company
microsoft
be
bootstrapped
from
the
begin
by
the
time
gate
begin
scout
for
a
new
location
for
the
company
in

of
microsoft
s
revenue
for
the

be
closing
in
on
the
million
dollar
mark
we
be
drive
hard
say
o
rear
but
we
played
hard
too
before
the
summer
end
the
last
one
they
would
spend
in
albuquerque
the
entire
microsoft

day
or
two
on
the
proposal
recall
o
rear
we
just
kind
of
ripped
the
proposal
off
the
printer
and
dash
for
the
airport
then
review
it
on
the
flight
down
the
report
propose
that
microsoft
supply
four
high
level
language
basic
fortran
cobol
and
pascal
for
ibm
s
new
microcomputer
more
significantly
it
propose
that
microsoft
develop
the
computer
s
disk
operating
system
or
do
their
plane
land
at
miami
international
airport
about
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
after
pick
up
their
luggage
gate
ballmer
and
o
rear
ducked
into
an
airport
restroom
and
quickly
change
into
suit
it
be
then
that
gate
discover
he
have
forgotten
to
bring
a
tie
but
they
barely
have
enough
time
to
make
the
meeting
up
the
coast
let
alone
go
shopping
beforehand
normally
gate
be
not
big
on
appropriate
dress
but
after
all
this
be
ibm
gate
knew
he
would
be
pelt
with
question
by
the
executive
wait
for
him
in
boca
raton
and
that
he
would
be
judged
not
only
on
his
answer
but
how
he
appear
and
how
he
handle
himself
he
simply
have
to
have
a
tie
even
if
it
meant
arrive
late
for
the
meeting
he
could
always
say
the
plane
be
late
but
to
those
men
in
white
shirt
and
blue
suit
there
could
be
no
excuse
for
show
up
without
a
tie
as
their
rental
car
speed
north
along
interstate
from
the
miami
airport
toward
boca
raton
a
worried
gate
stop
at
a
small
department
store
and
wait
for
it
to
open
so
he
could
buy
a
tie
the
store
door
be
unlocked
at
ten
o
clock
and
minute
later
gate
be
stand
at
the
counter
in
the
men
s
clothing
department
buying
a
conservative
look
tie
then
he
be
back
in
the
car
speed
toward
boca
raton
and
the
meeting
that
be
suppose
to
have
already
start
in
the
back
seat
bob
o
rear
watch
the
florida

rush
by
as
the
technical
person
in

microsoft
s
propose
operating
system
for
ibm
s
new
computer
his
stomach
be
tie
up
in
knot
from
the
strain
of
the
last
few
hectic
hour
on
the
plane
how
quickly
everything
be
happen
like
the
blur
of
scenery
outside
the
car
window
he
thought
to
himself
it
have
be
only
a
year
and
a
half
since
he
have
move
his
family
from
albuquerque
to
seattle
now
microsoft
a
company
with
seven
million
dollar
in
annual
sale
and
few
than
employee
be
about
to
go
into
business
with
ibm
an
international
giant
with
revenue
approach
thirty
billion
dollar
a
year
and
a
work
force
more
than
half
as
large
as
the
population
of
seattle
that
bill
gate
should
be
speed
along
the
south
florida
coast
toward
a
rendezvous
with
destiny
on
a
fall
morning
in
be
a
matter
of
luck
rather
than
brilliant
maneuvering
many
industry
pundit
would
later
argue
even
gate
acknowledge
that
have
it
not
be
for
a
break
or
two
thing
might
have
turn
out
very
differently
but
there
be
more
to
it
than
just
luck
he
and
paul
allen
have
strategically
position
microsoft
so
that
it
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
when
ibm
broke
with
tradition
and
go
look
for
a
software
vendor
for
its
entry
into
the
personal
computer
market
they
make
one
of
these
strategic
move
early
in
soon
after
microsoft
set
up
shop
on
the
eighth
floor
of
the
old
national
bank
building
in
bellevue
intel
have
recently
release
a
new
chip
call
the
and
although
some
in
the
trade
press
suggest
it
would
never
become
an
industry
standard
like
the
chip
gate
and
allen
believe
otherwise
they
be
certain
this
new
chip
would
become
the
engine
for
the
next
generation
of
personal
computer
as
a
result
they
ask
bob
o
rear
to
begin
work
immediately
on
a
basic
for
the
it
have
be
four
year
since
the
altair
appear
on
the
cover
of
popular
electronics
the
chip
have
indeed
become
a
standard
and
the
industry
have
invest
heavily
in
program
that
ran
only
on
that
chip
but
it
be
never
intend
to
supply
the
brain
power
for
the
advanced
need
of
microcomputer
its
maker
at
intel
have
envision
the
chip
go
into
such
thing
as
traffic
light
controller
with
the
however
intel
s
engineer
have
design
a
microprocessor
especially
for
the
personal
computer
technically
speak
the
chip
represent
bit
architecture
rather
than
the
bit
architecture
of
the
chip
this
meant
it
could
process
package
of
information
of
up
to
a
million
character
at
a
time
while
the
chip
be
limited
to
character
intel
s
new
chip
could
run
ring
around
the
old
chip
not
only
be
the
new
chip
many
time
faster
but
it
could
run
much
more
sophisticated
software
program
when
o
rear
begin
develop
basic
for
microsoft
no
one
in
the
industry
have
built
a
microcomputer
use
the
new
chip
o
rear
borrow
a
page
from
the
work
of
gate
and
allen
in
the
aiken
computer
lab
at
harvard
when
they
developed
basic
without
an
altair
o
rear
simulated
the
chip
on
a
dec
computer
a
couple
month
later
in
the
spring
of
o
rear
have
his
simulated
basic
run
however
he
still
didn
t
have
an
computer
just
down
the
freeway
in
tukwila
washington
at
a
mom

who
do
have
an

tim
paterson
an
electronic
hobbyist
since
high
school
paterson
be
a
thin
fast
talk
beard
program
whiz
with
a
fondness
for
fade
jean
he
have
hack
away
on
his
first
microcomputer
at
the
university
of
washington
in
when
his
roommate
bought
an
imsai
with
a
k
memory
board
like
the
altair
that
it
imitate
the
imsai
be
mostly
good
for
fun
and
game
that
same
year
paterson
saw
a
notice
post
in
the
university
computer
lab
that
the
retail
computer
store
in
seattle
be
look
for
a
salesperson
paterson
apply
for
and
get
the
job
he
soon
become
friend
with
rod
brock
a
frequent
customer
who
own
seattle
computer
product
when
paterson
graduate
from
the
university
in
early
he
go
to
work
for
brock
as
his
chief
technician
and
programmer
at
the
time
seattle
computer
product
built
memory
board
for
microcomputer
but
after
paterson
attend
a
local
seminar
on
intel
s
just
release
chip
in
late
summer
of
he
convince
brock
that
his
company
should
design
a
central
processing
unit
or
cpu
around
the
new
chip
the
cpu
be
the
heart
of
a
computer
paterson
have
a
prototype
cpu
board
work
by
may
and
he
take
his
computer
over
to
microsoft
we
be
help
them
because
seattle
computer
heed
an
basic
and
microsoft
be
work
on
one
paterson
recall
it
be
a
remarkable
coincidence
that
we
get
our
hardware
work
about
the
same
time
they
have
a
basic
simulator
but
they
didn
t
know
if
their
basic
would
work
so
we
brought
over
the
real
computer
and
give
it
a
go
unlike
the
basic
which
ran
the
first
time
allen
fed
it
into
the
altair
at
mit
in
albuquerque
the
basic
do
not
work
the
first
time
it
be
load
into
paterson
s
machine
but
a
few
minor
bug
be
soon
eliminate
and
before
the
end
of
may
microsoft
have
a
work
basic
just
in
time
to
show
it
off
at
the
upcoming
national
computer
conference
in
new
york
city
the
computer
industry
s
yearly
fair
a
software
distribution
company
know
as
lifeboat
associate
have
invite
microsoft
to
share
its
ten
by
ten
foot
booth
at
the
fair
and
paul
allen
have
invite
paterson
to
come
along
and
show
microsoft
s
basic
run
on
seattle
computer
s
machine
our
board
look
great
sit
up
there
on
display
say
paterson
we
have
a
terminal
with
basic
run
and
you
could
type
on
it
and
make
it
do
anything
you
want
as
usual
when
it
come
to
industry
shindig
like
the
ncc
microsoft
be
well
represent
gate
and
allen
be
there
as
well
as
o
rear
kay
nishi
steve
wood
and
his
wife
marla
chris
larson
also
make
the
trip
he
be
still
enrol
at
princeton
but
work
summer
at
microsoft
paterson
have
a
cheap
hotel
room
on
the
other
side
of
town
but
gate
checked
his
team
into
the
plush
park
plaza
where
king
and
president
usually
stayed
when
they
come
to
the
big
apple
gate
and
allen
have
adjoin
room
which
they
quickly
turn
into
the
company
s
first
hospitality
suite
it
wasn
t
something
a
lot
of
industry
people
do
back
then
recall
wood
we
decide
to
have
a
cocktail
party
in
the
suite
later
that
night
around
two
o
clock
when
as
wood
put
it
none
of
us
be
feel
any
pain
and
the
guest
have
clear
out
the
microkids
get
a
bag
of
bottle
rocket
that
larson
have
brought
along
found
an
empty
booze
bottle
open
a
window
in
the
suite
and
set
up
a
launch
pad
for
the
next
hour
or
so
they
shot
rocket
out
over
neighbor
central
park
while
gate
and
allen
be
entertain
guest
in
the
hospitality
suite
during
the

kay
nishi
be
out
round
up
more
business
from
japan
one
night
during
the
conference
nishi
show
up
at
the
plaza
hotel
with
about
a
dozen
executive
from
japanese
hardware
company
who
be
interested
in
do
business
with
microsoft
they
didn
t
have
a
place
to
stay
so
we
told
them
they
could
spend
the
night
in
the
suite
say
wood
we
call
housekeep
and
told
them
to
send
up
about
ten

basic
drew
a
lot
of
attention
at
the
national
computer
conference
in
new
york
city
that
june
of
but
not
nearly
as

as

be
unveiled
on
an

bricklin
have
conceive
the
idea
of
an
electronic
spread
sheet
in
during
his
first
year
at
harvard
business
school
when
bricklin
approach
one
of
his
harvard
professor
for
advice
on
his
idea
for
a
spread
sheet
program
the
professor
suggest
he
talk
with
one
of
his
former
student
dan
fylstra
who
have
recently
start
a
small
software
marketing
company
call
personal
software
fylstra
like
bricklin
s
idea
and
loan
him
an
apple
ii
computer
for
the
project
bricklin
then
enlist
the
help
of
bob
frankston
a
programmer
he
have
become
friend
with
while
at
mit
they
spent
the
winter
of
develop
what
would
become
know
as
visicalc
and
in
january
of
bricklin
start
his
own
firm
software
art
in
a
refurbish
chocolate
factory
in
the
boston
suburb
of
wellesley
he
and
frankston
then
sign
a
contract
with
personal
software
to
market
visicalc
although
sale
be
sluggish
at
first
visicalc
eventually
take
off
and
become
one
of
the
hottest
sell
software
product
in
the
personal
computer
industry
about
the
same
time
visicalc
hit
the

in
the
fall
of
a

call
micropro
begin
sell
a

my
impression

recall
raburn
be
he
be
just
another
one
of
those

learn
about

competitive
fire
which
burn
white
hot
in
or
out
of
a
go
cart
bill
be
competitive
plus
say
raburn
race
car
driver
have
a
phrase
for
it
red
mist
they
get
so
pumped
up
they
get

in
their
eye

raburn
join
microsoft

before
visicalc
come
out
in

raburn

have
picked
the
man
he
want
to

have
laid
the

foundation
for
his

future
growth
up
to
this

microsoft

when

you
have
a
well
chance
of
win

steve
smith
microsoft
s
first
marketing
director
and
genuine
business
manager
smith
have
join
microsoft
in
july
of
shortly
before
raburn
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
occur
to
bill
we
be
out
there
with
multiple
product
language
and
we
d
sell
them
and
we
just
weren
t
able
to
become
a
much
big
company
than
digital
research
or
micropro
what
we
realize
at
that
time
be
we
have
a
lot
of
product
we
dominate
the
language
business
but
the
only
product
that
really
make
a
lot
of
money
for
us
be
basic
that
s
because
you
have
to
have
a
copy
of
basic
on
every
computer
to
make
the
application
run
and
then
we
saw
wordstar
and
realize
that
micropro
be
a
one
product
company
and
then
we
saw
visicalc
now
we
have
no
intention
of
be
a
one
product

what
we

we

around
tektronix
smith
be
regard
as
something
of
a
maverick
in
late
smith
told
wood
that
in
another
six
month
he
would
be
ready
to
leave
tektronix
microsoft
smith
say
be
the
kind
of
company
he
want
to
work
for
it
become
apparent
to
me
smith
explain
that
the
guy
at
microsoft
really
have
their
act
together
but
may
not
have
really
know
it
themselves
it
wasn
t
obvious
to
me
that
they
understood
how
to
leverage
the
business
they
have
the
contract
with
apple
with
radio
shack
but
it
wasn
t
clear
they
be
turn
it
into
an
actual
business
i
be
amaze
at
how
successful
they
be
without
what
appear
to
be
any
real
business
management
smith
recognize
that
microsoft
be
a
company
ooze
with
entrepreneurial
talent
he
decide
that
if
a
business
expert
such
as
himself
join
the
company
microsoft
could
be
even
more
successful
from
my
point
of
view
he
say
they
be
just
lucky
and
if
i
get
involve
we
could
probably
add
some
discipline
on
the
business
side
it
didn
t
take
me
very
long
to
realize
they
really
weren
t
lucky
gate
really
understood
what
he
be
do
that
realization
come
to
smith
not
long
after
he
start
work
for
microsoft
when
gate
come
into
smith
s
office
one
day
and
shout
at
him
how
can
you
possibly
take
this
much
time
work
on
this
contract
just
get
it
do
recall
smith
of
that
short
but
educational
meeting
with
his
much
young
bos
i
think
what
i
realize
be
that
i
need
to
focus
that
the
money
and
the
opportunity
be
simply
there
and
i
need
to
close
contract
with
customer
so
i
focus
on
personal
performance
over
management
initially
i
be
deal
more
with
management
issue
as
a
guy
with
an
academic
background
come
out
of
a
large
company
but
it
only
take
me
a
couple
of
meeting
to
realize
that
personal
performance
be
what
matter
in
hire
smith
gate
be
hop
to
bring
more
credibility
for
microsoft
to
the
negotiate
table
at
year
old
smith
be
ten
year
old
than
most
of
the
people
work
for
the
company
with
the
exception
of
bob
o
rear
gate
be
only
and
look
more
like
which
he
recognize
be
a
liability
in
many
business
circumstance
gate
told
smith
during
the
job
interview
that
he
be
seek
someone
who
look
old
smith
be
the
first
nontechnical
person
with
the
company
to
do
oem
sale
which
mostly
have
be
handle
by
gate
smith
have
only
be
on
the
job
a
few
week
when
he
checked
microsoft
s
bank
balance
and
discover
ten
certificate
of
deposit
for
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
each
after
that
he
never
worried
about
his
marketing
budget
when
it
come
to
make
deal
for
microsoft
what
gate
may
have
lack
in
age
and
experience
he
make
up
for
in
self
confidence
and
business
acumen
usually
when
oem
customer
come
to
microsoft
they
be
ushered
into
smith
s
office
gate
would
come
in
a
short
while
later
smith
would
be
dress
in
a
suit
gate
would
often
be
wear
whatever
he
have
on
from
the
day
before
after
pull
an
all
nighter
in
the
office
they
always
thought
he
be
one
of
my
tech
support
guy
until
i
introduce
him
smith
say
i
think
they
be
impressed
by
his
youthfulness
and
his
technical
knowledge
and
frankly
as
soon
as
he
start
talk
the
credibility
be
there
the
credibility
wasn
t
there
until
he
start
discuss
what
microsoft
could
do
and
what
basic
could
do
in
the
fall
of
gate
and
smith
make
a
trip
to
a
division
of
the
xerox
corp
in
dallas
texas
to
negotiate
a
licensing
agreement
for

this
basic
perform
many
of
the
function
normally
handle
by
the
computer
s
operating
system
and
that
s
what
xerox
be
look
for
at
the
time
xerox
be
work
on
project
surf
a
joint
venture
with
a
company
call
convergent
technology
to
develop
a
personal
computer
it
be
a
big
deal
the
big
deal
microsoft
have
take
a
shot
at
when
gate
walk
into
the
xerox
conference
room
he
be
take
aback
by
the
august
surroundings
seat
around
a
huge
table
be
more
than
a
dozen
of
the
company
s
executive
and
technical
people
dress
in
expensive
suit
and
tie
gate
lean
over
to
smith
and
whisper
this
be
the
big
conference
table
i
ve
ever
see
smith
whisper
back
that
there
be
an
even
big
table
at
tektronix
the
meeting
be
a
bit
of
a
revelation
for
gate
prior
to
this
time
many
of
the
computer
company
he
have
dealt
with
be
little
start
up
operation
man
by
pie
eyed
visionary
like
gate
himself
they
related
now
gate
be
deal
with
some
of
the
big
corporation
in
america
but
if
that
cause
his
heart
to
race
no
one
around
the
table
could
tell
within
second
of
launch
into
his
presentation
gate
have
the
attention
of
the
room
charm
the
room
with
his
knowledge
of
the
product
and
complete
grasp
of
the
work
at
hand
year
later
a
person
who
have
attend
the
meeting
as
a
xerox
executive
say
gate
be
cool
as
a
cucumber
i
thought
he
do
this
every
day
for
a
living
it
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
easy
deal
to
cut
although
project
surf
never
produce
a
marketable
computer
before
the
day
be
out
microsoft
and
xerox
have
sign
a
contract
roughly
double
the
size
of
microsoft
s
previously
large
contract
gate
hat
to
lose
business
deal
he
told
smith
that
when
you
lose
a
deal
you
lose
it
twice
you
didn
t
get
the
money
and
the
other
company
do
if
the
deal
be
worth
then
you
essentially
lose
because
that
be
the
difference
between
what
you
could
have
have
and
what
someone
else
walk
away
with
we
have
one
rule
that
we
both
agree
on
recall
smith
we
would
never
lose
the
deal
for
all
his
native
acumen
gate
be
also
rough
edge
and
inexperienced
in
the
art
of
the
deal
gate
style
be
to
browbeat
customer
until
they
wilt
and
acquiesce
but
he
often
be
so
intense
in
negotiate
session
that
he
would
push
too
hard
and
actually
jeopardize
the
deal
a
former
top
microsoft
executive
say
there
be
almost
a
viciousness
to
the
intensity
gate
displayed
when
try
to
secure
a
deal
with
another
customer
i
ve
see
gate
lose
a
deal
in
negotiation
because
of
it
the
executive
say
most
sale
guy
get
more
gentle
he
get
mad
at
a
customer
after
work
together
for
a
while
gate
and
smith
developed
a
negotiate
strategy
to
offset
their
shortcoming
gate
be
cast
as
the
bad
cop
the
one
with
final
authority
to
agree
to
a
deal
the
more
experienced
smith
be
the
good
cop
the
one
who
handle
the
actual
negotiation
he
would
try
to
coax
every
last
dime
out
of
customer
and
if
talk
stall
over
a
penny
he
would
plead
helplessness
claim
he
could
do
no
well
than
the
offer
on
the
table
gate
after
all
be
the
guy
call
the
shot
the
tactic
and
the
fact
that
gate
be
loath
to
let
any
contract
get
away
be
productive
but
there
be
potential
pitfall
gate
and
smith
once
blew
an
important
deal
with
an
intel
subsidiary
after
gate
let
his
temper
flare
unchecked
smith
and
gate
in
separate
office
at
microsoft
headquarters
have
gotten
intel
on
the
phone
for
a
conference
call
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
gate
become
upset
over
a
bad
reference
microsoft
have
receive
from
another
division
within
intel
something
about
microsoft
be
late
with
delivery
normally
smith
would
break
into
the
conversation
and
smooth
thing
out
before
temper
get
out
of
hand
smith
however
be
call
away
from
the
phone
without
gate
knowledge
and
before
he
could
intervene
the
intel
representative
have
be
chewed
over
by
gate
pretty
thoroughly
when
the
shout
be
over
the
company
decide
to
buy
software
from
other
source
it
could
have
be
a
costly
lesson
except
that
the
intel
subsidiary
eventually

a

we

here
s
what
we
can
do
for
you

then
he
d
paint
a
grandiose
picture
about
what
microsoft
could
do
the
gatesian
vision
what
it
would
amount
to

we
re
sorry
we

get
you

put
you

well
position
what

out

a
complaint
about
a
small

turn
into
the

of
a
much
big

he

sometimes

he

a

more
than

more
than

in
the

head
by
vern
raburn
it
be
not
until
the
apple
ii
come
along
that
everyone
realize
just
how
huge
a
marketplace
software
could
be
say
allen
while
gate
played
the
more
visible
and
excite
public
role
of
wheel
deal
and
manage
microsoft
allen
be
conlent
to
stay
behind
the
scene
work
on
technical
innovation
like
the
softcard
but
their
ability
and
personality
tend
to
complement
one
another
and
thus
the
company
steve
wood
who
would
leave
microsoft
for
another
job
about
the
time
the
softcard
come
out
explain
the
difference
and
similarity
he
found
in
work
with
the
two
bill
be
extremely
driven
very
intense
very
impatient
and
in
term
of
personal
relationship
he
be
very
challenge
he
could
be
very
confrontational
extremely
so
a
lot
of
people
found
him
difficult
to
work
with
over
long
period
of
time
because
of
that
you
have
to
have
a
lot
of
self
confidence
but
what
a
lot
of
people
don
t
understand
be
that
paul
to
some
extent
have
some
of
those
same
trait
they
just
manifest
themselves
in
different
way
he
too
be
very
ambitious
and
very
competitive
but
paul
tend
to
be
a
lot
more
patient
about
thing
than
bill
that
be
always
a
very
nice
counter
allen
also
have
a
diverse
set
of
interest
outside
of
work
he
love
go
to
seattle
supersonics
basketball
game
with
his
father
mother
and
sister
or
jamming
with
other
microsoft
musician
at
his
home
he
and
a
few
of
the
company
s
new
programmer
have
even
form
a
band
gate
on
the
other
hand
be
much
more
focus
on
work
he
have
little
in
the
way
of
a
social
life
outside
of
microsoft
bill
be
much
less
one
of
the
guy
than
paul
say
a
programmer
who
go
to
work
at
microsoft
in
early
he
be
much
more
into
work
if
you
want
to
be
around
him
you
work
with
him
but
gate
do
unwind
occasionally
at
microsoft
party
which
be
thrown
fairly
often
usually
at
someone
s
home
or
apartment
on
a
weekend
night
these
party
be
a
welcome
break
another
programmer
described
the
microsoft
party
scene
in
before
the
company
s
project
with
ibm
pretty
much
put
everything
outside
of
work
on
hold
for
about
a
year
this
way
there
be
drinking
some
pot
smoking
the
party
be
for
the
most
part
limited
to
people
from
the
company
staff
the
number
of
male
be
pretty
lopsided
just
like
at
the
company
it
be
fairly
typical
stuff
for
that
age
group
at
that
time
it
occasionally
get
out
of
hand
but
usually
not
too
much
i
do
remember
one
time
bill
stumble
and
fall
down
a
staircase
and
when
somebody
make
a
remark
about
that
he
say
something
to
the
effect
that
he
like
stair
dive
and
he
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
stair
and
do
it
again
these
party
be
also
a
time
for
competitive
game
play
in
keep
with
the
character
of
the
people
who
work
at
microsoft
and
their
stair
dive
bos
one
game
in
particular
spoon
be
played
at
nearly
every
company
party
back
then
player
sat
in
a
circle
in
the
center
of
which
a
small
circle
of
spoon
be
arrange
with
handle
face
out
there
be
one
less
spoon
than
the
number
of
player
card
be
then
dealt
as
in
poker
and
when
a
player
get
a
predetermine
hand
he
or
she
could
reach
for
a
spoon
everyone
else
immediately
grabbed
for
a
spoon
too
the
player
who
didn
t
react
quickly
enough
be
out
of
the
game
but
just
like
in
poker
bluffing
be
a
big
part
of
the
game
and
anyone
touch
a
spoon
on
a
bluff
be
out
of
all
the
time
that
i
played
that
game
and
there
be
something
like
a
couple
of
time
a
month
at
least
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
a
game
that
bill
didn
t
win
say
michael
orr
a
manager
on
microsoft
s
cobol
language
development
project
who
be
hire
in
late
you
can
believe
that
a
lot
of
pretty
energetic
and
talented
people
be
say
to
themselves
god
damn
it
i
m
go
to
get
this
guy
this
time
no
matter
what
but
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
him
lose
this
intense
competitive
spirit
have
be
woven
into
the
fabric
of
the
company
and
it
be
as
much
a
part
of
the
work
scene
as
the
party
scene
gate
and
his
senior
programmer
who
often
have
out
of
town
business
with
oem
customer
have
a
run
contest
to
see
who
could
leave
the
downtown
bellevue
office
closest
to
flight
time
and
still
catch
their
plane
at
seattle
tacoma
international
airport
about
mile
way
gate
held
the
record
at
something
like
minute
which
would
have
be
astound
even
with
no
other
car
on
the
road
and
the
freeway
around
seattle
especially
head
to
the
airport
be
always
congest
push
thing
to
the
edge
be
the
gate
way
the
work
ethic
at
microsoft
if
anything
have
intensified
since
the
move
to
bellevue
there
be
in
fact
a
mystique
about
the
long
hour
employee
work
at
microsoft
there
be
an
unstated
job
requirement
that
employee
have
to
be
at
the
office
late
into
the
night
and
on
the
weekend
regardless
of
how
much
work
they
have
on
a
give
day
no
one
want
to
be
the
first
to
leave
we
be
be
driven
to
the
edge
all
the
time
say
one
programmer
the
long
hour
and
demand
personality
of
gate
finally
get
to
marla
wood
who
kept
the
company
s
book
and
help
with
other
office
chore
after
the
move
from
albuquerque
she
often
have
to
fetch
hamburger
and
milk
shake
from
across
the
street
each
day
for
the
programmer

never
left
the
office
for
lunch
for
a
while
marla
have
be
the
office
staff
but
gradually
the
company
hire
a
secretary
a
receptionist
and
several
other
people
for
clerical
duty
then
gate
start
date
microsoft
s
secretary
which
create
hard
feeling
in
the
office
the
young
woman
would
show
up
late
and
leave
early
not
exactly
the
regimen
expect
of
someone
who
work
for
microsoft
gate
be
often
condescend
to
the
five
or
six
other
woman
who
work
in
the
office
none
of
whom
have
any
technical
background
gate
would
often
lose
his
temper
which
be
upset
to
staff
worker
unfamiliar
with
his
confrontational
style
paul
be
much
easy
to
work
for
say
marla
he
would
blow
up
but
five
minute
later
it
would
be
as
if
nothing
happen
of
the
two
i
d
rather
work
for
paul
than
bill
any
day
they
be
very
different
personality
we
be
always

the
long
hour
they
put
in
at
microsoft
they
never
get
home
until
well
after
dark
they
would
typically
sleep
for
a
few
hour
get
up
the
next
day
and
head
back
to
the
office
they
could
only
spend
time
work
on
their
home
from
weekend
to

and
even
then
steve

the
next

her
husband
microsoft
s
general
manager
want
out
too
gate
fit
over
the

him
there

so
bright
so
intense
he

have
carefully
plan
this

know
the

would
never
accept
his

that
they
would

you

you
have

those

estridge
would
become
the
most
visible
and
the
best
know
the

agree
the

should
be
an
open
architecture
system
in
other
word
critical

this
radical
break
from
big

would
turn
out
to
be
the
key
decision
that
make

an
industry
standard
but
it
be
do
out
of
necessity

it
be
decide
that
the

that
ibm
contract
with
microsoft
to
develop
a
basic
for
that

his
recommendation
be
reject
ibm
come
up
with
its
own
software
for
the
system
machine
it
just
take
longer
and
cost
us
more
say

in

when
sam

the

have
less
than
a
month
remain
to
come
up
with
a

machine

gather
information
that
lowe
would
need
in
make
his
report
to
the
cmc
in
august
the
corporate
brass
have
not
yet
approve
the
to
project
sam
mission
in
visit
microsoft
be
merely
to
look
the
company
over
and
report
back
to
the
task
force
gate
would
not
be
told
of
ibm
s
plan
he
would
only
be
ask
very
general
question
but
he
would
have
to
sign
ibm
s
famous
nondisclosure
agreement
the
project
be
hush
hush
even
within
ibm
and
anything
discuss
at
the
meeting
have
to
remain
confidential
in
that
first
meeting
we
be
just
prospect
we
want
to
determine
whether
they
have
the
capability
to
deliver
on
a
schedule
we
knew
we
would
have
to
meet
say
sam
if
we
have
gotten
out
there
and
found
out
they
be
only
three
guy
we
d
have
to
take
a
hard
look
at
whether
they
would
be
able
to
do
the
work
or
not
sam
make
the
trip
to
microsoft
with
two
others
from
ibm
an
executive
from
purchasing
and
someone
from
corporate
relation
they
be
along
more
or
less
as
witness
sam
say
ibm
be
paranoid
about
security
when
they
get
off
the
elevator
on
the
eighth
floor
of
the
old
national
bank
building
in
bellevue
the
receptionist
notify
gate
who
be
in
his
office
i
knew
bill
be
young
but
i
have
never
see
him
before
say
sam
when
someone
come
out
to
take
us
back
to
his
office
i
thought
the
guy
who
come
out
be
the
office
boy
it
be
bill
well
i
ll
tell
you
or
anybody
else
and
i
told
ibm
executive
this
the
next
week
that
by
the
time
you
be
with
bill
for
fifteen
minute
you
no
longer
thought
about
how
old
he
be
or
what
he
look
like
he
have
the
most
brilliant
mind
that
i
have
ever
dealt
with
gate
would
later
say
that
the
ibm
team
ask
him
a
lot
of
crazy
question
at
that
first
meeting
the
next
day
steve
ballmer
typed
up
a
letter
for
gate
to
sign
thank
ibm
for
the
visit
when
sam
get
back
to
boca
raton
he
give
a
favorable
report
about
microsoft
and
its
young
president
i
recommend
that
we
base
our
plan
on
use
their
firm
sam
say
we
left
after
the
first
meeting

what
we
want
them
to
do

they
be
correct
a

hearing
the

give
the
go
ahead
the

would
have
exactly
one
year
to
get
the
new

the

a
second
meeting
between
microsoft
and
ibm
be
held
in
late
august
not
long
after
project
chess
have
receive
corporate
blessing
from
headquarters
in
armonk
sam
told
gate
on
the
phone
that
he
be
bring
along
four
others
from
ibm
include
an
attorney
when
the
five
suit
arrive
at
microsoft
they
be
met
by
an
equal
number
of
representative
from
microsoft
gate
be
join
by
allen
ballmer
nishi
and
an
attorney
from
his
father
s
law
firm
once
again
gate
and
his
team
be
ask
to
sign
the
nondisclosure
agreement
and
after
this
formality
they
be
then
told
what
they
already
suspect
ibm
have
a
top
secret
project
underway
to
develop
a
personal
computer
numerous
publish
account
over
the
year
have
say
that
it
be
gate
who
after
hearing
about
the
project
told
the
ibm
group
their
microcomputer
should
be
built
around
the
bit
intel
chip
and
not
the
old
bit
chip
gate
knew
the
more
advanced
chip
would
allow
microsoft
to
write
much
more
powerful
software
for
the
new
computer
the
preface
to
microsoft
s
own
m
do
encyclopedia
state
that
gate
and
microsoft
convince
ibm
to
base
its
machine
on
the
newer
and
faster
chip
ibm
be
however
unsure
of
microcomputing
technology
and
the
microcomputing
market
the
preface
say
one
of
ibm
s
solution
the
one
outline
by
sam
group
be
to
base
the
new
machine
on
product
from
other
manufacturer
all
the
necessary
hardware
be
available
but
the
same
could
not
be
say
of
the
software
hence
the
visit
to
microsoft
with
the
question
give
the
specification
for
an
bit
computer
could
microsoft
write
a
rom
basic
for
ibm
by
the
follow
april
microsoft
respond
positively
but
add
question
of
its
own
why
introduce
an
bit
computer
why
not
release
a
bit
machine
base
on
intel
s
chip
instead
at
the
end
of
this
meeting
the
first
of
many
sam
and
his
group
return
to
boca
raton
with
a
proposal
for
the
development
of
a
low
end
bit
business
workstation
the
venture
be
name
project
chess
microsoft
s
official
version
of
history
be
exaggerated
however
accord
to
key
member
of
the
project
chess
task
force
all
affirm
that
ibm
engineer
in
boca
raton
have
decide
to
use
bit
architecture
long
before
gate
be
ever
told
about
the
machine
bill
sydnes
engineering
manager
for
project
chess
and
the
first
man
to
be
hand
picked
by
lowe
for
the
member
task
force
have
this
to
say
about
microsoft
s
claim
that
s
a
crock
of
bull
absolutely
a
crock
of
bull
we
have
already
do
the
system
with
an
bit
architecture
and
the
hardware
be
completely
do
and
ready
to
ship
and
the
operating
system
be
about
a
year
or
year
and
a
half
away
when
we
start
the
pc
program
so
i
move
over
to
do
that
and
we
have
firmly
settle
on
the
fact
that
it
have
to
be
a
bit
architecture
because
of
where
we
thought
the
machine
be
go
to
go
over
time
several
chip
be
consider
for
the
ibm
personal
computer
accord
to
sydnes
include
motorola
s
but
this
bit
chip
have
some
technical
flaw
basically
motorola
wasn
t
ready
sydnes
say
they
be
still
six
to
nine
month
off
from
where
we
need
them
to
be
the
task
force
eventually
decide
to
use
intel
s
chip
rather
than
the
the
be
a
bit
chip
with
some
characteristic
of
bit
technology
the
main
reason
for
go
with
this
chip
be
that
it
be
not
as
fast
as
the
which
sydnes
say
have
a
little
too
much
horsepower
for
the
machine
they
envision
by
use
the
chip
engineer
could
easily
upgrade
to
the
in
time
sam
confirm
that
the
boca
raton
group
have
already
decide
to
use
a
bit
chip
before
gate
be
contact
but
he
say
gate
be
not
told
this
at
the
second
meeting
because
of
the
ibm
secrecy
protocol
so
gate
may
well
have
believe
he
be
make
a
recommendation
that
ibm
act
on
we
have
select
the
for
reason
of
our
own
but
we
do
not
tell
that
to
bill
sam
say
we
essentially
ask
for
his
recommendation
and
among
his
recommendation
be
that
we
use
the
bit
architecture
i
m
sure
he
believe
he
suggest
it
to
us
but
we
clearly
never
intend
to
use
the
bit
cpu
again
gate
also
recommend
that
the
ibm
computer
have
color
capability
sam
say
and
he
make
several
suggestion
about
the
keyboard
ibm
want
microsoft
to
supply
software
development
tool
such
as
basic
for
its
personal
computer
and
gate
agree
to
do
so
when
he
met
with
sam
for
the
second
time
in
late
august
of
don
estridge
the
leader
of
the
project
chess
team
would
later
explain
to
byte
magazine
why
ibm
do
not
go
with
its
own
basic
ibm
have
an
excellent
basic
it
s
well
receive
run
fast
on
mainframe
computer
and
it
s
a
lot
more
functional
than
microcomputer
basic
be
in
but
the
number
of
user
be
infinitesimal
compare
to
the
number
of
microsoft
basic
user
microsoft
basic
have
hundred
of
thousand
of
user
around
the
world
how
be
you
go
to
argue
with
that
as
far
back
as
albuquerque
microsoft
s
slogan
have
be
we
set
the
standard
that
vision
and
commitment
be
now
about
to
pay
off
since
there
be
not
enough
time
to
develop
its
own
software
for
project
chess
ibm
not
only
need
to
buy
basic
but
more
importantly
a
microcomputer
operating
system
from
an
outside
source
and
the
most
popular
one
at
the
time
be
cp
m
the
operating
system
developed
by
gary
kildall
of
digital
research
sam
say
he
be
under
the
assumption
that
microsoft
have
the
right
to
the
cp
m
source
code
when
he
first
contact
gate
in
july
microsoft
have
just
release
the
softcard
which
allow
product
write
for
cp
m
to
run
on
the
apple
ii
our
target
market
be
the
apple
software
say
sam
people
be
buying
the
apple
for
business
purpose
and
we
knew
the
product
would
sell
many
of
these
product
be
base
on
cp
m
so
it
be
clear
to
us
that
we
need
a
cp
m
or
compatible
machine
our
proposal
the
one
we
originally
talk
to
microsoft
about
be
to
use
the
source
code
for
the
softcard
they
be
then
marketing
for
the
apple
i
presume
they
be
able
to
offer
us
a
bit
version
of
the
operating
system
but
we
really
didn
t
discover
until
the
second
or
third
meeting
that
be
not
true
because
we
weren
t
able
at
the
first
meeting
to
ask
the
sort
of
detailed
question
we
want
to
ask
microsoft
not
only
do
not
have
the
right
to
sell
or
license
the
cp
m
source
code
to
ibm
but
digital
research
which
own
cp
m
have
not
yet
developed
a
bit
version
of
the
software
obviously
sam
and
the
ibm
team
be
a
little
out
of
touch
with
what
be
happen
in
this
new
industry
sam
flew
to
bellevue
to
meet
with
gate
several
more
time
during
september
at
what
would
have
be
their
third
or
fourth
meeting
since
the
first
contact
they
talk
at
length
about
the
operating
system
for
the
new
pc
ibm
want
microsoft
to
supply
it
with
not
only
basic
but
also
language
such
as
fortran
cobol
and
pascal
stand
alone
basic
could
function
without
an
operating
system
but
microsoft
s
other
language
could
not
ibm
need
to
make
up
its
mind
about
what
it
want
to
do
for
an
operating
system
gate
say
time
be
short
bill
told
us
if
we
want
a
bit
cp
m
we
would
have
to
deal
with
kildall
say
sam
we
say
oops
we
have
really
only
want
to
deal
with
one
person
but
now
we
have
to
talk
with
kildall
i
ask
bill
if
he
would
make
an
appointment
for
us
gate
picked
up
the
phone
in
his
office
and
call
kildall
at
digital
research
gate
told
kildall
he
be
send
him
some
important
customer
so
treat
them
right
he
then
hand
the
phone
to
sam
who
make
an
appointment
for
his
team
to
visit
kildall
the
next
day
gary
kildall
and
bill
gate
go
back
a
long
way
to
computer
center
corporation
when
gate
be
one
of
the
bunch
of
crazy
kid
from
lakeside
hire
to
try
to
crash
the
c
cubed
computer
little
do
gate
know
how
often
in
the
come
year
his
path
would
cross
that
of
kildall
who
have
occasionally
paid
nighttime
visit
to
the
young
programmer
at
c
cubed
or
how
profound
the
consequence
would
be
a
seattle
native
whose
father
own
a
navigation
school
kildall
have
enrol
as
an
undergraduate
at
the
university
of
washington
with
thought
of
become
a
high
school
math
teacher
until
a
friend
show
him
a
computer
program
write
in
fortran
he
be
immediately
hooked
he
later
design
a
program
to
help
his
father
calculatetide
table
a
job
previously
do
by
hand
for
a
local
publishing
company
after
get
his

where
he
taught
computer
science
at
the
nearby
u
s
naval
postgraduate
school
kildall
bought
one
of
intel

write
a
simple

for
it

and
allen

with
in

kildall
developed
a

for
it
too
in
return
for
his
consult
work

give
kildall
a

he
set
up
in
his
classroom
at
the

kildall
who
do
not
have
the
necessary
hardware

brought
in
john
torode
a
friend
from
the

its
own
way
of
do
thing
such
as
manage
memory
and
file
system
if
microsoft
s
programmer
could
write
software
for
the
same
operating
system
on
each
computer
all
they
wpuld
have
to
do
be
modify
their
code
slightly
for
whatever
specific
device
a
customer
s
computer
might
have
when
we
be
talk
to
another
oem
a
hardware
customer
who
want
to
run
basic
or
any
of
our
product
we
get
to
a
point
by
or
where
we
be
always
try
to
get
them
to
go
to
digital
first
and
get
cp
m
run
because
it
make
our
job
a
whole
lot
easy
recall
steve
wood
when
we
be
do
custom
thing
like
the
general
electric
version
or
ncr
version
it
get
to
be
a
real
headache
it
make
our
life
a
lot
easy
if
someone
would
just
go
license
cp
m
and
get
that
up
on
their
machine
and
then
our
stuff
would
pretty
much
run
as
be
and
gary
would
do
likewise
if
someone
go
to
him
to
license
cp
m
and
they
be
look
for
language
he
would
refer
people
to
microsoft
it
be
a
very
synergistic
kind
of
thing
in
fact
there
be
an
unwritten
agreement
between
gate
and
kildall
that
microsoft
would
stay
out
of
the
operating
system
end
of
the
business
and
kildall
would
not
get
into
microcomputer
language
accord
to
industry
source
not
that
microsoft
do
not
want
to
get
into
this
market
too
early
on
in
new
mexico
we
talk
about
develop
an
operating
system
say
wood
we
ask
ourselves
if
we
should
really
be
refer
all
this
business
to
gary
we
always
come
back
with
the
same
answer
we
have
all
this
other
stuff
to
do
at
one
point
probably
in
late
gate
consider
a
merger
with
digital
which
certainly
would
have
change
the
face
of
the
industry
gate
flew
to
monterey
and
talk
about
a
possible
deal
over
dinner
at
the
kildall
home
it
be
a
fairly
serious
discussion
say
kildall
at
the
time
microsoft
be
think
about
move
but
they
couldn
t
decide
where
either
back
to
seattle
or
to
the
west
coast
i
thought
it
be
an
okay
idea
a
merger
but
we
weren
t
able
to
come
to
any
final
agreement
i
don
t
know
how
our
personality
would
have
mixed
i
get
along
fine
with
him
but
we
would
have
have
to
explore
it
more
microsoft
be
not
the
only
company
try
to
promote
cp
m
as
an
industry
standard
lifeboat
associate
a
new
york
software
distributor
that
have
start
out
as
a
club
for
cp
m
user
push
it
as
well
publishing
a
catalog
of
digital
s
software
microsoft
also
sell
its
cp
m
base
language
such
as
fortran
through
the
catalog
later
lifeboat
associate
do
cp
m
implementation
oem
customer
would
license
the
operating
system
from
digital
then
ask
lifeboat
to
have
it
port
to
their
computer
microsoft
work
closely
with
lifeboat
in
try
to
make
cp
m
a
standard
there
be
this
vigorous
effort
to
get
all
the
computer
maker
to
support
that
operating
system
and
microsoft
s
language
too
say
one
microsoft
programmer
there
be
intense
lobbying
from
bill
and
from
tony
cold
of
lifeboat
associate
what
really
create
the
microcomputer
industry
more
than
any
other
thing
be
that
all
these
hardware
manufacture
didn
t
really
have
a
clue
what
the
industry
as
a
whole
be
go
to
be
do
and
they
all
get
lobby
real
hard
to
support
a
consistent
operating
system
so
there
would
be
a
market
for
application
but
in
late
the
synergistic
relationship
between
microsoft
and
digital
begin
to
unravel
after
kildall
package
his
operating
system
with
a
basic
that
have
be
developed
by
gordon
eubanks
one
of
his
student
at
the
naval
postgraduate
school
eubanks
cbasic
have
be
on
the
market
for
about
two
year
and
it
represent
the
only
real
alternative
to
the
basic
offer
by
microsoft
it
wasn
t
a
real
strong
competitor
but
it
be
a
competitor
say
wood
of
cbasic
when
digital
start
marketing
that
it
upset
thing
a
little
bit
what
it
do
be
add
a
little
more
fuel
to
our
internal
discussion
whether
we
should
be
in
the
operating
system
there
be
a
big
market
there
cp
m
wasn
t
all
that
sophisticated
should
we
try
and
do
something
on
our
own
kildall
say
there
be
never
any
promise
on
his
part
to
keep
out
of
language
digital
research
in
fact
have
developed
several
language
such
as
basic
and
fortran
which
it
have
introduce
in
the
business
market
there
be
an
agreement
in
principal
that
microsoft
would
do
language
and
we
would
do
operating
system
but
that
be
only
because
at
the
time
we
be
do
operating
system
and
they
be
do
language
it
wasn
t
like
we
have
divvied
up
the
market
place
my
own
personal
expertise
be
in
language
so
i
certainly
wasn
t
go
to
give
that
up
cbasic
pose
no
market
threat
to
microsoft
kildall
say
regardless
of
whether
it
be
a
real
or
perceive
threat
it
be
at
that
time
that
gate
in
reaction
go
to
at
t
and
license
its
unix
operating
system
which
microsoft
sell
at
a
discount
under
the
name
xenix
bill
be
not
happy
recall
steve
smith
microsoft
s
marketing
manager
who
have
join
the
company
in
digital
be
now
in
our
language
and
it
couldn
t
have
be
more
than
a
month
or
two
before
we
be
introduce
xenix
it
be
as
simple
as
that
when
they
come
into
our
market
we
go
after
their
market
we
knew
that
eventually
we
would
be
compete
with
all
the
software
company
but
when
they
be
the
one
that
be
aggressively
move
into
our
market
we
tend
to
react
aggressively
kildall
say
he
do
not
lose
any
sleep
when
he
learn
gate
have
license
an
operating
system
xenix
be
not
significant
kildall
say
it
be
not
any
bother
to
me
at
all
it
didn
t
make
any
difference
it
be
like
so
what
unix
be
not
in
the
market
place
we
be
into
it
be
mostly
for
scientific
work
station
as
it
be
now
it
be
never
a
threat
to
us
in
our
business
market
such
be
the
state
of
affair
between
microsoft
and
digital
research
in
september
of
when
gate
picked
up
the
phone
and
call
kildall
once
again
he
be
send
business
to
someone
he
now
consider
a
competitor
but
now
he
have
no
choice
ibm

just
off

have
become
part
of
the
folklore
of
the
personal
computer

a
story
that
be
told
over
and
over
whenever
the

friend
of
kildall

kildall
acknowledge
he
be
fly

but
i
be
out
fly
on
business
just
like

pretty
scary
my

that
before
i
explain
that
these
be
not

no
problem
with
the
nondisclosure
agreement
kildall
say
that
when
the

he
felt
there
be
an
understand
that

with
its
cp
m
operating
system
that
night

kildall
be
off
fly
in
his
plane
when
ibm
want
to
do
business
with
him
that
s
microsoft
s
version
kildall
say
it
become
legend
the
winner
of
the
battle
not
the
loser
get
their
version
record
as
history
and
kildall
have
have
his
nose
rubbed
in
that
story
for
a
dozen
year
he
s
clearly
sensitive
to
the
criticism
that
his
bad
business
judgment
allow
gate
to
walk
away
with
the
agreement
to
produce
an
operating
system
for
ibm
it
would
certainly
bother
me
if
i
have
make
that
dumb
a
move
or
if
others
have
make
it
on
my
behalf
say
john
torode
kildall
s
friend
who
design
the
disk
system
for
their
microcomputer
he
now
run
a
computer
business
in
seattle
but
how
much
preparation
do
digital
have
do
they
know
it
be
ibm
that
be
come
do
they
have
time
to
develop
a
strategy
have
they
already
conclude
it
be
smart
to
tell
ibm
to
go
jump
in
the
lake
or
do
it
just
happen
because
of
the
personality
of
the
folk
who
be
there
at
the
time
i
ve
never
discuss
that
with
gary
i
never
want
to
rub
his
nose
in
it
regardless
of
what
really
happen
that
day
most
of
those
in
the
computer
industry
believe
kildall
s
action
help
make
microsoft
the
software
giant
it
be
today
sam
say
he
subsequently
telephone
kildall
after
the
ill
fat
trek
to
digital
research
i
told
him
we
be
serious
we
really
do
want
to
talk
with
him
i
have
to
assume
we
have
gotten
off
to
a
bad
start
and
that
he
wouldn
t
arbitrarily
refuse
to
do
business
with
us
you
know
do
he
have
some
religious
opposition
to
us
he
say
no
no
no
we
really
do
want
to
talk
with
you
but
sam
say
he
and
others
at
ibm
could
not
get
kildall
to
agree
to
spend
the
money
to
develop
a
bit
version
of
cp
m
in
the
tight
schedule
ibm
require
we
try
very
hard
to
get
a
commitment
from
gary
sam
say
when
we
couldn
t
i
finally
told
him
look
we
just
can
t
go
with
you
we
ve
get
to
have
a
schedule
and
a
commitment
we
can
get
one
from
gate
in
a
series
of
meeting
with
microsoft
after
the
initial
rebuff
from
digital
research
sam
threw
the
operating
system
problem
in
gate
lap
this
be
the
negotiate
tactic
we
take
with
them
say
sam
we
want
this
to
be
their
problem
to
find
us
the
right
operating
system
one
that
we
could
integrate
successfully
on
our
schedule
luck
once
again
would
shine
on
bill
gate
an
operating
system
for
the
bit
intel
chip
have
just
be
developed
by
tim
paterson
at
seattle
computer
product
not
more
than
a
twenty
minute
drive
from
microsoft
tim
paterson
have
always
want
to
design
an
operating
system
for
a
microcomputer
but
have
the
father
of
do
realize
he
be
go
to
stir
up
so
much
controversy
he
might
have
stuck
with
race
car
which
he
enjoy
almost
as
much
as
program
after
show
off
seattle
computer
s
cpu
board
at
the
national
computer
conference
in
the
spring
of
paterson
have
return
to
seattle
to
perfect
the
board
so
they
could
be
sell
commercially
during
this
time
he
be
contact
by
digital
research
which
want
one
of
the
cpu
board
in
order
to
develop
a
bit
version
of
cp
m
but
seattle
computer
do
not
have
any
board
to
spare
paterson
ask
when
digital
expect
to
have
its
new
version
of
cp
m
ready
by
december
he
be
told
seattle
computer
begin
shipping
its
first
cpu
board
to
customer
in
november
of
microsoft
s
stand
alone
basic
be
offer
as
an
option
these
first
customer
be
mostly
software
developer
by
april
of
digital
research
have
still
not
design
cp
m
paterson
decide
to
wait
no
longer
he
would
develop
his
own
operating
system
here
we
have
something
that
would
work
but
we
be
wait
and
wait
for
digital
to
come
out
with
their
version
of
the
operating
system
for
the
say
rod
brock
owner
of
seattle
computer
product
they
kept
tell
us
any
day
now
we
will
have
it
this
delay
be
really
cost
us
sale
it
s
hard
to
sell
a
product
without
an
operating
system
we
be
probably
sell
five
to
ten
board
a
month
but
figure
there
be
a
lot
more
sale
out
there
than
that
we
need
an
operating
system
to
get
them
five
month
later
in
september
around
the
time
jack
sam
be
be
stonewall
by
dorothy
mcewen
and
the
lawyer
at
digital
research
paterson
have
his
operating
system
up
and
run
for
the
first
time
he
call
it
qdos
which
stood
for
quick
and
dirty
operating
system
seattle
computer
begin
shipping
paterson
s
qdos
to
customer
this
be
a
real
product
say
paterson
everyone
always
think
ibm
be
the
first
to
have
it
that
s
crap
we
ship
it
a
year
before
they
do
it
be
use
on
our
computer
we
be
sell
a
computer
that
be
more
than
twice
as
fast
as
the
one
ibm
be
go
to
come
out
with
the
reason
for
the
difference
in
speed
be
that
the
ibm
pc
use
the
slow
chip
just
as
gary
kildall
have
have
to
read
over
the
year
how
he
lose
the
ibm
deal
because
he
be
off
fly
in
the
cloud
paterson
have
have
to
read
how
he
ripped
off
cp
m
in
develop
an
operating
system
that
become
the
industry
standard
typical
be
this
comment
from
an
unidentified
digital
employee
who
be
quote
in
a
business
month
article
that
depict
gate
as
a
silicon
bully
we
never
try
to
patent
cp
m
nobody
be
patent
software
then
it
be
almost
unethical
but
if
we
have
microsoft
probably
couldn
t
have
developed
m
do
because
part
of
the
original
source
code
look
a
lot
like
cp
m
s
how
else
do
paterson
and
gate
come
up
with
that
nice
new
operating
system
overnight
at
one
point
kildall
telephone
paterson
and
accuse
him
of
rip
off
cp
m
at
the
time
say
paterson
i
told
him
i
didn
t
copy
anything
i
just
take
his
print
documentation
and
do
something
that
do
the
same
thing
that
s
not
by
any
stretch
violate
any
kind
of
intellectual
property
law
make
the
recipe
in
the
book
do
not
violate
the
copyright
on
the
recipe
i
d
be
happy
to
debate
this
in
front
of
anybody
any
judge
although
paterson
s
operating
system
mimicked
some
cp
m
function
there
be
significant
improvement
qdos
store
data
on
disk
in
a
completely
different
way
than
cp
m
do
and
it
also
organize
file
differently
paterson
s
goal
be
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
software
developer
to
be
able
to
translate
what
have
become
a
huge
body
of
program
that
ran
on
the
popular
cp
m
so
they
could
run
on
his
operating
system
he
first
obtain
intel
s
manual
for
its
chip
which
have
detailed
rule
for
translate
instruction
into
instruction
paterson
write
a
translator
that
follow
intel
s
guide
he
then
get
digital
s
cp
m
manual
and
for
each
function
he
write
a
correspond
function
once
you
translate
these
program
my
operating
system
would
take
the
cp
m
function
after
translation
and
it
would
respond
in
the
same
way
say
paterson
to
do
this
do
not
require
ever
have
cp
m
it
only
require
take
digital
s
manual
and
write
my
operating
system
and
that
s
exactly
what
i
do
i
never
look
at
kildall
s
code
just
his
manual
once
paterson
have
qdos
work
he
contact
paul
allen
and
ask
him
if
microsoft
want
to
adapt
any
of
its
software
for
seattle
computer
s
new
operating
system
that
s
when
they
found
out
we
have
it
say
paterson
up
until
then
microsoft
have
be
unsure
what
it
be
go
to
do
about
obtain
an
operating
system
digital
research
be
out
of
the
picture
ibm
do
not
have
time
to
develop
an
operating
system
within
the
month
deadline
set
by
its
corporate
brass
neither
do
microsoft
at
least
not
if
it
have
to
start
from
scratch
without
an
operating
system
the
entire
pc
project
appear
to
be
in
jeopardy
the
feel
be
if
we
couldn
t
solve
it
the
project
couldn
t
go
forward
say
bob
o
rear
the
microsoft
programmer
who
would
soon
be
give
technical
responsibility
for
the
operating
system
we
d
have
no
language
to
sell
on
the
ibm
pc
it
be
of
paramount
importance
that
we
engineer
a
solution
to
the
operating
system
equation
we
have
to
do
something
so
that
this
project
could
go
forward
in
late
september
allen
contact
rod
brock
and
told
him
that
microsoft
have
a
potential
oem
customer
who
might
be
interested
in
seattle
computer
s
new
operating
system
allen
who
could
not
reveal
the
identity
of
the
customer
want
to
know
if
microsoft
could
act
as
the
licensing
agent
brock
say
yes
gate
would
later
say
that
obtain
seattle
computer
s
operating
system
save
microsoft
about
one
year
of
work
ibm
have
told
gate
it
want
a
final
proposal
from
microsoft
in
october
and
time
be
run
out
gate
face
a
critical
decision
could
microsoft
deliver
language
and
an
operating
system
and
still
meet
the
demand
schedule
ibm
have
set
to
have
a
computer
ready
for
market
within
a
year
the
software
would
have
to
be
finish
before
that
probably
in
about
six
or
seven
month
the
four
language
ibm
want
basic
cobol
fortran
and
pascal
would
require
write
about
byte
of
code
an
operating
system
would
likely
mean
another
byte
of
code
accord
to
microsoft
on
september
a
sunday
night
gate
allen
and
nishi
be
in
gate
eighth
floor
corner
office
in
the
downtown
bank
building
brainstorming
about
the
operating
system
should
they
commit
to
it
suddenly
nishi
jumped
to
his
foot
wave
his
short
little
arm
in
the
air
and
shout
gotta
do
it
gotta
do
it
that
s
when
it
become
obvious
to
gate
that
more
byte
of
code
for
an
operating
system
be
no
big
deal
of
course
they
have
to
do
it
kay
s
kind
of
a
flamboyant
guy
and
when
he
believe
in
something
he
believe
in
it
very
strongly
gate
would
say
later
he
stood
up
make
his
case
and
we
just
say
yeah
not
long
after
this
gate
be
pace
nervously
in
his
office
late
at
night
wait
impatiently
for
the
last
page
of
a
lengthy
computer
printout
when
the
machine
be
finally
silent
he
grabbed
the
pile
of
paper
it
have
be
spit
out
stuck
it
in
his
briefcase
and
dash
out
of
the
building
with
ballmer
and
o
rear
for
the
airport
microsoft
s
final
report
to
ibm
be
ready
it
be
now
time
to
get
down
to
hard
core
negotiation
with
the
guy
in
blue
suit
in
boca
raton
previously
publish
account
of
this
crucial
meeting
between
microsoft
and
ibm
include
the
book
blue
magic
fire
in
the
valley
and
the
make
of
microsoft
report
that
paul
allen
make
the
trip
to
boca
raton
with
gate
and
ballmer
this
be
not
so
it
be
bill
and
steve
and
myself
say
o
rear
i
m
not
sure
why
p
ul
didn
t
make
it
because
he
be
certainly
heavily
involve
maybe
he
be
off
on
some
other
project
that
eve
ning
it
be
a
situation
where
we
kind
of
finish
the
proposal
to
ibm
tore
it
off
the
computer
race
out
to
the
airport
barely
make
the
flight
flew
all
night
get
there
bought
a
tie
for
bill
and
make
the
pitch
the
report
gate
carry
with
him
cover
hundred
of
technical
issue
involve
both
hardware
and
software
recommendation
for
the
pc
but
it
also
detailed
financial
matter
early
on
sam
have
talk
to
gate
about
a
fix
price
for
an
unlimited
number
of
copy
of
any
software
microsoft
license
to
ibm
the
longer
gate
thought
about
this
proposal
the
more
he
become
convince
it
be
bad
business
microsoft
would
be
make
a
huge
financial
investment
in
this
project
and
a
lump
sum
payment
from
ibm
would
not
give
the
young
company
much
of
a
return
on
its
investment
over
time
when
gate
board
the
nonstop
delta
flight
for
miami
he
have
decide
to
insist
on
a
royalty
arrangement
with
ibm
sam
have
make
it
clear
from
the
first
of
his
meeting
with
gate
that
microsoft
would
retain
ownership
of
whatever
software
it
developed
in
fact
ibm
want
nothing
to
do
with
help
microsoft
other
than
make
suggestion
from
afar
there
have
be
a
lot
of
speculation
about
why
we
ever
let
microsoft
have
the
proprietorship
and
all
that
say
sam
the
reason
be
internal
we
have
have
a
terrible
problem
be
sue
by
people
claim
we
have
steal
their
stuff
it
could
be
horribly
expensive
for
us
to
have
our
programmer
look
at
code
that
belong
to
someone
else
because
they
would
then
come
back
and
say
we
stole
it
and
make
all
this
money
we
have
lose
a
series
of
suit
on
this
and
so
we
didn
t
want
to
have
a
product
which
be
clearly
someone
else
s
product
work
on
by
ibm
people
we
go
to
microsoft
on
the
proposition
that
we
want
this
to
be
their
product
i
ve
always
thought
it
be
the
right
decision
when
the
rental
car

gate
ballmer

o
rear
pull
up
in

have
a
new
tie
dangle
from

later
if

be
nervous
he
didn
t
show
it
as
usual
he
be
in
complete
command
of
his
material
and
his

sydnes
engineering
manager
for
project
chess
we
do
not
recruit
what
you
might
call
typical
ibm
blue
for
work
on
the
pc
program
they
be
all
unusual
character
a
special
camaraderie
developed
between
the
ibm
and
microsoft
team
work
on
the
project
personal
nontechnical
email
be
sent
daily
and
the
two
group
give
each
other
a
good
natured
hard
time
when
one
group
fell
behind
schedule
which
be
often
in
an
interview
with
pc
magazine
after
the
project
be
finish
gate
talk
about
that
camaraderie
this
ibm
project
be
a
super
excite
fun
project
we
be
give
even
for
a
small
company
an
incredible
amount
of
latitude
in
change
how
thing
get
do
as
the
project
progress
and
we
have
a
really
great
interface
with
the
people
from
the
customer
ibm
even
though
they
be
as
far
away
as
they
could
be
we
love
to
kid
them
about
all
the
security
how
we
have
to
have
lock
and
sign
thing
in
and
use
code
name
and
stuff
like
that
i
be
very
very
impressed
with
the
team
they
put
together
we
be
the
only
vendor
that
understood
what
the
project
be
about
even
up
to
the
announcement
most
vendor
be
kept
in
the
dark
about
the
general
scope
and
the
general
push
of
thing
so
we
enjoy
a
really
unique
relationship
gate
go
on
to
describe
the
scene
at
microsoft
during
the
year
long
project
as
very
much
like
that
which
tracy
kidder
capture
in
his
book
the
soul
of
a
new
machine
about
a
group
of
computer
whiz
kid
at
data
general
who
push
themselves
to
the
limit
of
endurance
to
build
a
new
kind
of
computer
microsoft
s
first
priority
be
get
the
operating
system
up
and
run
on
the
acorn
this
responsibility
fell
to
bob
o
rear
other
software
be
developed
for
the
pc
have
to
run
on
top
of
the
operating
system
and
if
o
rear
couldn
t
adapt
seattle
computer
s
do
to
the
prototype
the
entire
project
be
doom
if
i
be
awake
i
be
think
about
the
project
say
o
rear
who
work
throughout
december
without
even
take
christmas
or
new
year
s
day
off
just
like
many
of
the
others
at
microsoft
who
be
on
the
project
though
seattle
computer
have
furnish
microsoft
a
copy
of
do
back
in
september
when
microsoft
inform
the
company
it
have
a
possible
oem
customer
for
the
operating
system
no
licensing
agreement
have
be
sign
by
the
end
of
that
didn
t
seem
to
worry
anyone
we
have
no
hesitation
to
let
them
try
it
out
say
tim
paterson
six
day
into
the
new
year
microsoft
and
seattle
computer
finally
sign
an
agreement
give
microsoft
a
nonexclusive
right
to
market
do
this
meant
seattle
computer
could
continue
to
license
its
operating
system
to
other
customer
the
negotiation
be
handle
by
paul
allen
and
rod
brock
the
owner
of
seattle
computer
although
the
agreement
be
sign
by
gate
he
and
brock
never
met
or
even
talk
for
each
sublicense
of
do
microsoft
agree
to
pay
seattle
computer
plus
an
additional
if
the
source
code
be
part
of
the
sublicense
seattle
computer
also
receive
for
signing
the
agreement
we
come
to
an
agreement
fairly
easily
say
paterson
vice
president
of
seattle
computer
we
even
call
digital
research
to
see
what
they
sell
their
stuff
for
we
get
a
feel
for
what
the
price
be
like
of
course
no
one
at
seattle
computer
knew
that
microsoft
s
unnamed
customer
for
the
operating
system
be
ibm
with
revenue
approach
nearly
thirty
billion
dollar
one
important
clause
in
the
contract
state
nothing
in
this
licensing
agreement
shall
require
microsoft
to
identify
its
customer
to
seattle
computer
product
recall
brock
that
seem
strange
to
us
but
we
agree
to
go
along
microsoft
end
up
pay
seattle
computer
a
total
of
under
term
of
the
agreement
because
it
turn
around
and
sublicensed
do
and
the
source
code
to
only
one
customer
ibm
a
source
at
microsoft
who
be
privy
to
the
negotiation
with
ibm
for
the
operating
system
say
microsoft
license
the
first
version
of
do
to
big
blue
for
only
microsoft
also
receive
royalty
as
part
of
the
license
although
the
royalty
arrangement
have
always
be
a
closely
guard
secret
at
ibm
and
microsoft
we
be
an
aggressive
company
the
microsoft
employee
say
our
strategy
be
we
would
make
our
money
on
the
language
remember
we
already
have
the
deal
for
all
the
language
and
digital
research
be
suppose
to
have
the
deal
for
cp
m
and
when
it
look
like
we
might
lose
the
language
deal
because
ibm
didn
t
have
an
operating
system
we
simply
be
go
to
solve
the
problem
and
we
solve
that
problem
for
about
but
i
can
assure
you
it
cost
us
more
than
that
to
make
the
delivery
and
i
can
also
assure
you
we
make
money
on
the
basic
we
make
money
on
the
license
we
already
have
and
we
make
sure
that
we
get
the
operating
system
deal
not
so
much
to
make
money
and
not
so
much
to
set
the
world
standard
but
simply
because
we
couldn
t
close
our
language
deal
without
it
for
a
while
o
rear
wonder
if
he
would
ever
get
do
run
on
the
hardware
he
be
use
in
the
small
stuffy
win
dowless
room
at
microsoft
the
technical
problem
with
both
the
software
and
hardware
seem
endless
the
prototype
machine
deliver
to
microsoft
just
after
thanksgiving
be
just
that
rough
draft
they
didn
t
work
very
well
o
rear
continuously
fire
off
memo
to
his
contact
in
boca
raton
about
equipment
problem
complain
about
the
difficulty
of
meeting
the
january
date
for
the
delivery
of
do
and
the
basic
due
to
breakdown
in
the
hardware
ibm
have
provide
microsoft
didn
t
make
the
january
deadline
it
be
not
until
february
that
o
rear
finally
get
do
to
run
on
the
prototype
he
still
vividly
remembers
the
moment
it
be
like
the
middle
of
the
night
it
be
one
of
the
most
joyous
moment
of
my
life
to
finally
after
all
the
preparation
and
work
and
back
and
forth
to
have
that
operating
system
boot
up
and
tell
you
that
it
s
ready
to
accept
a
command
that
be
an
excite
moment
the
ibm
team
in
boca
raton
want
several
change
in
the
operating
system
and
allen
ask
paterson
to
help
with
these
the
change
be
all
fairly
minor
for
example
ibm
want
one
feature
that
remains
on
do
today
the
date
and
time
stamp
another
change
involve
the
so
call
prompt
that
do
left
on
the
screen
when
the
system
come
up
the
prompt
that
paterson
have
design
for
do
be
the
drive
letter
follow
by
a
colon
neat
and
simple
but
ibm
want
the
cp
m
prompt
which
be
the
drive
letter
follow
by
a
colon
follow
by
the
great
than
sign
use
in
mathematics
it
make
me
want
to
throw
up
say
paterson
of
the
request
for
cp
m
prompt
but
he
oblige
paterson
be
work
blind
as
he
make
the
request
change
in
his
operating
system
he
do
not
have
a
prototype
computer
he
do
not
even
know
one
exist
seattle
computer
picked
up
an
occasional
hint
that
microsoft
s
unnamed
customer
might
be
ibm
one
day
in
early
spring
of
brock
receive
a
call
from
someone
who
say
he
be
with
ibm
and
he
have
a
question
about
the
operating
system
brock
knew
his
company
have
not
license
do
to
ibm
so
he
ask
the
caller
where
he
be
locate
the
caller
immediately
hung
up
brock
later
mention
to
a
sale
rep
who
call
on
seattle
computer
from
time
to
time
that
microsoft
be
deal
with
an
oem
who
do
not
want
to
be
identify
the
computer
sale
rep
told
brock
he
have
heard
a
similar
story
from
a
friend
at
intel
the
chip
maker
also
have
an
agreement
with
an
oem
who
want
to
remain
anonymous
give
the
scope
of
the
pc
project
and
the
number
of
people
at
ibm
who
be
either
work
on
the
computer
or
knew
about
it
word
probably
should
have
leak
out
about
what
be
go
on
at
microsoft
and
at
the
entry
level
system
facility
in
boca
raton
but
other
than
rumor
specific
detail
didn
t
get
out
at

not
until
near
the

joked
that
this
be

big
yet
ibm
have
more
people
write
requirement
for
the
computer
than
microsoft
have

code
o

felt
overwhelmed
by
the
number
of
people
he
have

have
the

to
a
version
that
could

on
the

very
hectic
around
there
leeds
recall
everybody

driven
real
proud
to
be
kid
work
on
the

fifteen

leeds
have
a
habit
of
collect
pen
that
have
be
chewed
obsessively
by
gate
in
only
a
couple
of
month
its
grow
to
be
a
very
large
collection
gate
worried
incessantly
about
the
project
he
knew
that
ibm
have
a
habit
of
spending
vast
amount
of
money
on
research
project
that
never
saw
the
light
of
day
ibm
would
conclude
a
product
could
not
be
market
and
then
put
the
lid
on
it
bury
forever
in
its
giant
bureaucracy
up
until
the
final
day
before
the
pc
be
announce
gate
be
haunt
by
the
thought
that
ibm
would
cancel
the
project
have
his
nightmare
scenario
come
true
microsoft
would
have
be
hurt
significantly
because
gate
have
thrown
so
much
of
the
company
s
resource
into
the
project
there
be
always
the
fear
that
ibm
would
decide
not
to
announce
this
that
someone
would
say
nice
effort
guy
but
we
don
t
want
to
go
into
this
personal
computer
business
say
o
rear
gate
get
a
particularly
bad
case
of
the
jitter
when
the
industry
journal
infoworld
in
its
june
issue
report
in
alarm
detail
about
the
top
secret
pc
project
in
boca
raton
gate
worried
that
such
story
would
blow
ibm
s
cover
and
cause
it
to
abandon
the
effort
the

the

it
go
on
to
describe
the

size
monitor
and
keyboard
the
article
even
talk
about
the
operating
system
ibm
give
some
thought
to
use
cp
m
as
the
disk
operating
system
for
the
personal
computer
but
this
would
have
be
an
incredible
departure
from
normal
ibm
product
development
strategy
infoworld
report
instead
the
operating
system
for
this
new

will
be
similar
to
cp
m
in
many
respect
the
designer
didn
t
strive
for
compatibility
just
similarity
the
article
end
with
a
strong
denial
from
an
ibm
spokesperson
we
ask
harry
smith
of

so
upset
by

call
the

as
an

spokesperson
and
scold
them
for
printing
rumor
in

about

curry
head
up
the
west
coast
to
seattle
computer
which
he
knew
be
marketing
a
bit
operating
system
know
as
do
curry
offer
brock
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollar
for
the
right
to
do
while
he
be
in
seattle
curry
make
one
other
visit
to
microsoft
he
told
gate
why
he
be
in
town
there
be
no
reason
not
to
tell
him
because
i
couldn
t
in
good
faith
do
the
deal
with
brock
and
have
bill
find
out
about
it
curry
say
lifeboat
have
business
relationship
with
bill
and
i
would
have
have
to
tell
him
something
that
wasn
t
true
plus
i
have
a
personal
relationship
with
bill
so
i
told
him
about
the
offer
allen
who
have
dealt
with
seattle
computer
in
the
past
write
brock
a
letter
ask
that
microsoft
be
give
an
exclusive
license
to
sell
do
allen
say
microsoft
want
to
compete
directly
against
digital
research
i
felt
paul
out
on
the
phone
and
we
arrive
at
a
halfway
decent
agreement
i
thought
say
brock
they
would
come
up
with
fifty
grand
and
give
us
beneficial
term
on
buying
all
the
high
level
language
microsoft
offer
but
when
brock
receive
the
agreement
drawn
up
by
microsoft
s
lawyer
it
have
change
from
what
allen
have
told
him
over
the
phone
it
be
now
a
sale
agreement
microsoft
want
to
buy
the
operating
system
outright
it
would
then
relicense
do
back
to
seattle
computer
an
attorney
who
saw
the
original
agreement
say
gate
personally
go
through
the
document
and
in
his
own
handwrite
change
key
language
to
specify
a
sale
of
do
instead
of
an
exclusive
license
that
be
just
a
brilliant
master
stroke
on
his
part
the
lawyer
say
microsoft
not
seattle
computer
would
have
ownership
of
do
say
brock
i
call
paul
on
it
he
say
microsoft
s
attorney
thought
it
would
work
out
well
this
way
well
i
wasn
t
fully
convince
but
i
could
see
the
fifty
thousand
buck
on
the
other
hand
and
we
certainly
need
capital
at
that
point
brock
didn
t
take
curry
s
offer
of
five
time
that
much
because
microsoft
agree
to
provide
seattle
computer
with
update
version
of
do
brock
figure
this
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
seattle
computer
since
tim
paterson
be
no
longer
around
to
work
on
the
operating
system
microsoft
must
have
be
get
antsy
say
brock
because
they
sent
steve
ballmer
over
he
try
to
get
us
to
hurry
up
and
agree
to
the
thing
and
sign
it
i
met
with
him
personally
he
basically
told
me
how
it
be
a
good
deal
how
it
would
not
change
anything
whether
or
not
they
own
it
or
we
own
it
since
we
would
have
unlimited
right
to
use
it
i
guess
he
convince
me
because
paul
call
a
few
day
later
and
say
come
on
over
to
bellevue
and
let
s
sign
the
paper
when
brock
show
up
at
microsoft
on
july
allen
call
in
paterson
to
read
over
the
agreement
paterson
told
brock
he
thought
the
offer
be
a
fair
one
we
have
no
idea
ibm
be
go
to
sell
many
of
these
computer
paterson
say
they
be
a
stranger
to
this
business
somehow
people
seem
to
think
we
have
an
inkling
it
be
go
to
be
this
big
success
i
certainly
didn
t
so
buying
do
for
fifty
thousand
dollar
be
a
massive
gamble
on
microsoft
s
part
a
chance
before
brock
sign
the
agreement
allen
take
it
into
gate
who
be
in
another
office
brock
could
hear
gate
and
allen
talk
but
gate
never
come
in
to
greet
him
a
few
minute
later
allen
come
back
with
the
agreement
and
brock
sign
over
ownership
of
do
to
microsoft
brock
met
gate
by
chance
for
the
first
time
a
couple
of
year
later
at
a
popular
bellevue
restaurant
call
jonah
and
the
whale
the
name
be
appropriate
the
big
fish
have
eat
the
little
fish
the
operating
system
that
once
belong
to
seattle
computer
have
by
then
become
an
industry
standard
by
microsoft
be
make
more
than
million
a
year
just
from
sale
of
m
do
on
august
two
week
and
two
day
after
microsoft
acquire

no

really
knew
what

go
to

because
it

i
don
t
think
i
have
a
sense
for
the

i
m
think
more
in
term
of
the
hardware
itself
i
didn
t
give
much
thought
at
all
at
that

to
the
ramification
of
the
operating

what
an
impact
that

have
i
still
have
a

of
idea
that
cp

extremely
important

although
ibm
apologize
an
appropriate
number
of
time
to
gate
for
the

it
be
a
sign
of

on
friday
november
but
neither
the
cold
drizzle

could
dampen
the
spirit
of
the
boisterous
group
who

a
year
earlier
by
blair

the
computer
whiz
who
later
kill
himself
microsoft
do
not
need
the
venture
capital
gate
be
essentially
hire
the
firm
s
expertise
in
incorporation
procedure
he
be
also
position
the
company
should
it
eventually
go
public
as
apple
computer
have
do
the
year
before
in
december
it
be
ballmer
who
convince
gate
to
sell
off
a
small
part
of
the
company
as
a
long
term
investment
in
the
future
we
just
threw
that
million
dollar
into
the
bank
with
all
our
other
million
say
steve
smith
microsoft
s
first
business
manager
as
a
private
corporation
microsoft
could
now
offer
stock
incentive
to
its
employee
although
there
have
be
some
grumble
about
the
lack
of
a
company
stock
plan
most
of
the
technical
people
work
for
gate
would
probably
have
remain
with
microsoft
even
without
one
but
stock
participation
in
the
company
make
it
easy
to
attract
good
people
employee
could
buy
stock
for
about
a
share
own
stock
in
the
company
make
up
for
a
lot
of
hard
work
at
low
pay
microsoft
do
not
pay
very
well
in
comparison
with
the
rest
of
the
industry
but
it
be
very
generous
with
its
stock
option
when
the
company
go
public
in
a
number
of
long
time
employee
become
millionaire
on
paper
the
pay
be
always
okay
but
never
much
more
than
okay
say
one
programmer
who
be
work
for
microsoft
in
when
the
stock
plan
be
first
announce
follow
incorporation
nobody
ever
do
real
well
at
microsoft
until
the
stock
start
come
they
didn
t
pay
well
at
all
especially
when
you
consider
the
hour
involve
the
big
compensation
for
most
people
be
be
in
a
place
where
you
be
go
to
know
more
about
what
be
happen
in
the
industry
than
you
could
anywhere
else
although
it
take
a
long
time
for
the
rest
of
the
world
to
realize
it
everybody
at
microsoft
understood
the
company
s
significance
from
early
on
there
be
never
any
doubt
in
my
mind
practically
from
the
time
i
hire
on
that
microsoft
be
go
to
be
the
most
important
company
in
the
personal
computer
industry
gate
underscored
that
message
to
his
programmer
whenever
he
get
the
chance
one
day
in
late
gate
approach
richard
leeds
project
manager
for
cobol
one
of
the
language
that
microsoft
deliver
to
ibm
for
the
pc
in
the
hallway
of
the
northup
building
outside
of
leeds
office
gate
be
try
to
get
the
word
out
about
what
he
consider
microsoft
s
top
priority
and
what
be
on
his
mind
be
microsoft
s
operating
system
strategy
we
re
go
to
put
digital
research
out
of
business
he
told
leeds
slam
his
fist
into
the

those

intense

digital
be
a
very
important

its

of
machine
the

be
the
company
s
first
attempt
at
a
personal

the

persuade

want

offer
microsoft

with
the

this
word
processing
application
be
under
development
at
microsoft
in
but
be
not
officially
release
until
the
follow
year
although
version
of
word
be
design
to
work
on
computer
that
ran
on
either
cp
m
or
do

insist
that
digital

s
deal
for
word
also
include
his
do
operating

i
remember
them
dec
official
tell
me
they
be
not
go
to
follow
in
ibm
s
wake
with
do
the
industry
source
say
and
that
be
a
thorn
in
bill
s
side
because
his
gambit
be
to
get
all
the
oems
sign
up
with
do
so
digital
research
would
get
bumped
off
and
more
importantly
so
that
do
would
be
secure
the
fact
that
dec
have
picked
up
a
different
operating

be
sort
of
an
embarrassment
to
bill
but
when
the
smoke
clear
dec
be
offering
m
do
as
an
option
there
s
no
question
in
my
mind
that
bill
told
them
if
they
want
microsoft
word
they
have
to
at
least
offer
m
do
curry
for
one
believe
it
be
good
for
the

in
the
long
run
that
microsoft
beat
out
digital
research
for
control
of
the
operating
system
that
become
the
standard
in
personal
computer
you
could
not
have
rely
on
people
like
gary
kildall
say
curry
he
didn
t
have
the
vision
the
understand
of
the
problem
if
you
talk
to
bill
about
any
software
company
or
any
hardware
company
there
s
a
very
high
probability
that
he
will
be
able
to
tell
you
who
the
ceo
be
what
their
revenue
be
last
year
what
they
be
currently
work

the

he

very
very
knowledgeable

he
pride
himself
on

what

go

kildall
never
have
that
as
thing
turn
out
microsoft

t
have
to

that

the
most
incorrect
thing
we
could
do
we
reach
that
conclusion

we
thought

would
grow
far
beyond

anybody
could
see
back

that
no

there
too
he
intend
to
take
the
lucrative

by

it
would
prove
a

formidable
battle
than
he
ever
imagine
as
a
newcomer
in

go
up
against

would
later
acknowledge
that
he

at
the

do
another

lead
by
charles

be
put
the

on
multiplan
in

for
a

his

simonyi
have
quit
his

at

one

in
the

they
share
the

that
would
make

easy
to
use
than
ever
before
gate
want

to
become
more
important
to

simonyi
be
the

genius
he
picked
to

happen
he

would
tell

design
the
experimental
alto
computer
several
time
more
powerful
than
the

its

would
inspire
steve

to
develop
the

develop
a
revolutionary
advanced

by
the

introduce
the

developed
at

the

the

the

disappear
the

could
have

much
sooner
but
either
xerox
be
uninterested
in
the
commercial
potential
of
the
work
be
do
at

or
it
be
too
slow
to
react
in
the
market
place
as
a
result
parc
begin
to
lose
some
of
its
best
people
to
less
sluggish
company
like
apple
and
microsoft
i
lose
faith
in
xerox
s
ability
to
do
anything
recall
simonyi
shortly
after
he
decide
to
start
look
for
a
new
job
in
late
simonyi
have
lunch
with
a
former
parc
colleague
bob
metcalfe
who
have
recently
found
his
own
software
company
com
metcalfe
give
simonyi
a
list
of
industry
people
to
contact
about
a
job
at
the
top
of
the
list
be
the
name
bill
gate
i
call
bill
and
steve
ballmer
and
told
em
they
should
jump
at
the
chance
to
get
simonyi
say
metcalfe
and
of
course
they
do
we
have
a
fantastic
meeting
simonyi
say
of
his
initial
visit
to
microsoft
for
the
interview
with
gate
and
ballmer
i
be
incredibly
impressed
bill
have
an
incredible
grasp
of
the
future
it
be
not
something
i
expect
from
an
operation
that
compare
to
xerox
be
a
fly
by
night
outfit
we
be
kind
of
snobbish
at
xerox
we
thought
the
apple
ii
be
kind
of
a
joke
simonyi
be
also
impressed
that
gate
knew
so
much
about
program
people
talk
about
how
lucky
bill
be
or
how
nice
his
parent
be
but
when
i
come
here
i
wasn
t
bet
on
his
nice
family
i
be
bet
on
his
ability
to
understand
the
business
and
his
vision
of
the
future
which
have
turn
out
to
be
right
after
hire
simonyi
gate
spent
on
a
xerox
star
and
laser
printer
make
microsoft
one
of
the
first
company
to
buy
the

gate
be
lay
the
foundation
for
microsoft
s
development
of
window
as
well
as
application
for
apple
s
macintosh
computer
which
would
incorporate
a
graphical
user
interface
in
its
design
the
star
wasn
t
a
real
popular
machine
but
it
be
there
to
play
with
if
you
want
to
learn
something
about
the
user
interface
principal
recall
programmer
bob
wallace
although
apple
s
macintosh
be
not
publicly
announce
until
early
its
secret
development
be
already
underway
in
cupertino
by
in
fact
gate
have
be
give
a
sneak
peek
at
the
first
prototype
and
when
additional
prototype
be
available
in
early
apple
quietly
deliver
them
to
microsoft
apple
want
microsoft
to
develop
software
for
the

to
have
it

many
people
work
on

have
on
the

at

there
be
prototype
machine
from
other

strewn
about
microsoft
as
well
most
of
them
in
room
with
paper
cover
the
glass
wall
so
no
one
could
look
inside
computer
manufacturer
often
furnish
microsoft
with
a
prototype
month
before
their
computer
be
due
to
be
release
so
system
software
could
be
instal
although
the
corporate
atmosphere
around
microsoft
be
still
very
informal
with
programmer
work
in
jean
and
t
shirt
there
be
a
lot
more
security
than
in
the
early
day
in
albuquerque
before
the
serious
work
start
with
ibm
everything
be
out
in
the
open
on
table
say
wallace
who
left
microsoft
to
start
his
own
software
company
in
early
in
albuquerque
we
have
a
large
table
and
you
could
see
maybe
twenty
different
personal
computer
on
that
table
that
be
due
out
the
next
year
everything
that
be
go
to
happen
in
the
personal
computer
world
be
on
that
table
there
be
no
real
secrecy
and
nobody
thought
much
about
that
but
then
ibm
impose
a
lot
of
secrecy
and
that
be
true
of
the
macintosh
work
it
get
to
the
point
where
you
knew
there
be
go
to
be
an
industry
announcement
about
a
new
computer
some
of
the
office
be
cover
with
computer
paper
on
the
inside
so
you
could
not
look
in
them
and
you
knew
there
be
a
private
project
in
there
then
you
would
read
in
the
newspaper
that
a
new
computer
have
be
announce
and
you
would
walk
down
the
corridor
and
all
the
paper
have
come
down
on
one
of
the
office
and
there
be
the
new
machine
virtually
the
only
programmer
at
microsoft
not
work
under
strict
secrecy
requirement
impose
by
either
apple
ibm
or
other
computer
manufacturer
be
those
develop
multiplan
with
multiplan
charles
simonyi
have
inherit
a
project
that
have
be
underway
for
more
than
a
year
in
when
work
begin
on
the
project
gate
hire
an
outside
consultant
to
thoroughly
examine
visicalc
and
make
a
report
on
how
it
could
be
improve
gate
do
not
like
the
way
the
visicalc
spreadsheet
work
and
he
intend
to
improve
not
only
on
its
performance
but
its
look
a
spreadsheet
be
make
of
many
different
cell
and
in
visicalc
these
cell
be
refer
to
by
a
coordinate
such
as
a
gate
want
to
use
english
name
for
multiplan
s
cell
such
as
sale
june
simonyi
make
far
enhancement
to
multiplan
draw
from
his
work
at
parc
he
incorporate
user
friendly
menu
into
the
product
multiplan
be
finish
in
but
extensive
beta
test
delayed
its
release
in
a
beta
test
the
product
be
give
free
of
charge
to
select
customer
who
use
it
for
a
period
of
time
in
this
way
bug
not
found
during
the
development
stage
can
be
discover
and
eliminate
before
the
product
be
officially
market
the
release
of
multiplan
be
also
held
up
while
microsoft
perfect
software
tool
allow
easy
adaption
of
its
spreadsheet
to
other
computer
platform
though
microsoft
have
developed
the
operating
system
for
the
ibm
personal
computer
not
even
gate
believe
the
machine
or
his
do
would
become
as
successful
as
they
do
eventually
dominate
the
market
so
a
key
microsoft
goal
for
multiplan
be
portability
multiplan
be
to
be
an
application
that
could
be
run
on
different
machine
and
different
operating
system
it
be
eventually
tailor
to
run
on
more
than
different
computer
platform
everybody
be
guess
about
how
the
personal
computer
market
would
develop
say
jeff
raikes
to
be
honest
we
guess
wrong
we
thought
there
would
be
dozen
and
dozen
of
platform
maybe
even
hundred
multiplan
be
officially
introduce
in
the
summer
of
to
general
praise
throughout
the
industry
software
review
say
multiplan
be
easy
to
use
and
rat
it
excellent
in
every
category
test
add
that
multiplan
seem
to
have
be
design
with
the
sole
objective
of
take
visicalc
s
place
as
market
leader
at
the
time
visicalc
have
sell
nearly
copy
since
its
introduction
in
gate
believe
microsoft
now
have
the
spreadsheet
that
would
become
the
industry
standard
as
it
turn
out
he
be
wrong
visicalc
would
eventually
be
knock
down
for
the
count
but
it
would
not
be
microsoft
that
threw
the
punch
the
first
version
of
multiplan
be
release
for
the
apple

face
the

problem
brought
on
by
rapid
growth

there
be
serious
concern
over
whether
microsoft

someone

could
take
some
of
the
load
off
gate
although
microsoft
have
establish
a
considerable
reputation
in
the

it
be
still
a
relatively
small
company
with
few

most
of
the
explosive
growth
in
the
personal
computer
industry
be
take
place
in
the
silicon
valley
of

and
it

several
possible

towne
agree
to
take
the

at

towne
hardly
fit
the

of
the

microkid
about

with
a

and
two
kid
he
be
year
old
than
the
average
microsoft

and
he
do
not
have
a
technical
background
what
he
do
have
be
a
brilliant
mind
and
a
lot
of
energy
quality
that
ballmer
and
gate
demand
of
key
people
who
work
for
the

towne
be
a
personable
man
who
believe
in
delegate
authority
and
manage
through
subtlety
he
would
prove
quite
a
contrast
to
gate
and
ballmer
whose
style
be
anything
but
subtle
despite
its
overwhelm
financial
success
microsoft
be
in
dire
need
of
sound
management
practice
as
towne
quickly
discover
bookkeeping
for
the
multimillion
dollar
company
be
still
be
do
on
a
small
radio
shack
computer
the
marketing
people
have
no
idea
how
much
of
a
product
they
thought
they
could
sell
there
be
no
budgeting
system
or
salary
structure
for
example
huge
difference
exist
in
the
stock
option
grant
to
programmer
who
do
equivalent
work
it
seem
to
towne
there
be
a
philosophy
at
microsoft
that
to
be
creative
one
have
to
be
out
of
control
this
be
a
critical
time
for
the
company
towne
say
in
an
interview
with
softalk
the
industry
magazine
for
the
ibm
personal
computer
user
it
s
my
job
to
shepherd
it
through
the
stage
from
twenty
to
sixty
million
dollar
in
sale
i
m
not
a
software
guy
but
i
enjoy
this
company
help
solve
their
industrial
problem
all
the
structure
get
different
in
big
company
but
we
have
to
recognize
that
to
bright
people
big
be
not
beautiful
one
of
gate
manager
would
not
survive
the
company
s
explosive
growth
vern
raburn
president
of
the
consumer
product
division
be
responsible
for
develop
retail
market
where
microsoft
s
new
software
application
product
would
be
sell
microsoft
have
little
experience
in
the
risky
retail
end
of
the
business
it
be
use
to
deal
with
computer
manufacturer
who
need
language
or
an
operating
system
penetrate
the
consumer
retail
market
require
more
than
technical
ability
it
require
a
strong
marketing
and
sale
department
as
well
raburn
s
great
strength
lay
in
his
relationship
with
the
early
pioneer
in
the
industry
he
knew
everyone
and
he
do
business
by
simply
pick
up
the
phone
and
call
on
a
friend
early
on
at
microsoft
he
have
achieve
terrific
result
base
on
these
friendship
but
his
way
of
do
business
could
not
sustain
microsoft
as
the
company
grow
a
more
formal
and
professional
marketing
approach
be
require
we
need
to
move
to
the
next
level
of
distribution
sophistication
say
one
microsoft
executive
we
need
broader
and
more
aggressive
merchandising
tactic
that
an
ibm
would
use
rather
than

the

a

with
some
i
can
t
even
get

gate
say
he
expect

to
get
well
over
the
next
two
year
we
ll
come
up
with

that

actually
meet

all
the
way
right
now
much
of
the

be
either
bad

too
hard
to

but
these
barrier
be
come
down
microsoft

multiplan
certainly
met
the

only
a

month
into
the

it
have
completely
overtaken
both

in

when

jonathan

that

where
the

admire
what
lotus
founder
mitch
kapor
have
be
able
to
do
with
lotus
though
lose
to
a
competitor
drove
him
up
the

the

old
kapor
a
former

with
a
fondness
for

have
found
lotus
in
with
several
million
dollar
in

as

he
have

by
write

package
for

then
know
as

and
later
sell
the
right
to
the
program
kapor
s
strategy
in
develop
his
spreadsheet
be
just
the
opposite
of
that
take
by
microsoft
lotus
only
ran
on
one
machine
the
ibm

it
take
full
advantage
of
newer
version
of
the

by
comparison

s
request
to
fit
into
the
k
memory
of
the
first
version
of
the

the
result
of
course
be
that
easily
outperform
multiplan
lotus
and
not
microsoft
have
create
the
spreadsheet
standard
what
help
to
kill
multiplan
be
that
it
be
built
to
go
on
every

platform
during
its

gate
have
make

with

maker
although
microsoft
own
the

for
the

it
didn
t
realize
the

be
go
to
become
the
only
computer
platform
of
significance
kapor
on
the
other
hand
gamble
that
there
would
be
a
big
enough
market
if
he
focus
solely
on
the
ibm
pc
and
he
be
right
multiplan
be
well
than
lotus
in
many
way
but
it
be
slow
lotus
ran
ten
time
faster
than
any
other

on
the

this
be
a
big
big
loss
say
one
industry
executive
talk
about
the
beating
microsoft
take
from
lotus
it
derail
a

more
than

multiplan
it

all
of

the
multi

product
microsoft

as
a
follow
up
to

they

the

kind
of

that
multiplan
be

it
be
no
longer
a
reasonable
way
of
approach
application
lotus
definitely

sidetrack
microsoft

no

we

write
for
an

that
be
the

it

also
the
begin
of
a
change
in
strategy
by
microsoft
whose
programmer
have
be
work
hard
to
adapt
software
to
a
number
of
machine
that
be
not

we
wound
up
do
a

of
work
for
nothing
when
the
ibm
pc
emerge
as
a
standard
and
compatible
clone
begin
show
up
say
bily
the
software
developer
who
have
join
microsoft
in
after
graduate
from
mit
bily
have
be
assign
to
work
with
paul
allen
on
develop
a
basic
that
could
be
quickly
adapt
for
any
computer
platform
with
only
a
few
hour
of
work
microsoft
felt
that
this
project
have
the
potential
to
bring
the
company
enormous
amount
of
money
with
little
investment
of
resource
the
project
be
in
beta
test
in
when
it
be
suddenly
cancel
a
lot
of
other
project
around
microsoft
be
also
shelve
because
of
the
shift
in
strategy
away
from
multiple
computer
platform
you
put
your
heart
into
a
project
and
the
world
change
underneath
you
say
bily
software
engineering
be
not
a
job
with
us
it
be
an
obsession
a
lot
of
resource
get
lose
because
the
industry
change
and
the
engineer
weren
t
told
about
it
bill
gate
in
his
office
on
microsoft

sprawl
collegelike
campus
in
redmond
washington
courtesy
of
the
seattle
post
intelligencer
it
be
not
surprising
that
software
developer
around
microsoft
didn
t
see
what
be
happen
in
the
industry
they
be
usually
sequester
in
their
office
like
monk
in
a
monastery
leave
only
to
sleep
or
have
a
late
night
beer
at
the
mustard
seed
tavern
in
bellevue
sometimes
they
just
slept
in
the
office
bily
described
what
it
be
like
in
and
when
he
be
work
on
the
basic
project
with
allen
it
be
all
guy
i
start
at
age
and
about
a
year
later
i
be

everyone
have
move

know
anyone
so
you
bury
yourself
in
your
work
and
get
a
lot
of
work
do
every
thursday
night
many
of
these
young
programmer
would
go
out
for
a
beer
play
foosball
on
the
tavern
machine
and
talk
science
fiction
before

home
or
back
to

although
paul
allen
would
often
join
them
for
a
beer
gate
do
not
gate
be
so
busy
run
microsoft
that
he
no
longer
even
have
time
for
his
boyhood
friend
carl
edmark
in
early
their
friendship
be
inexplicably
damage
by
a
seemingly
minor
incident
they
have
plan
to
see
the
just
release
movie
star
base
on
the
true

on
our
relationship
be
strain
edmark
recall
it
s
something
i
never
fully
understood
we
eventually
grow
apart
completely
after
that
night
he
simply
didn
t
have
time
for
the
friendship
edmark
felt
that
gate
have
rebuffed
him
because
he
be
not
rigorous
enough
in
schedule
his
time
with
gate
the
microsoft
ceo
s
time
have
grown
too
limited
the
basic
project
paul
allen
have
be
work
on
with
raymond
bily
would
turn
out
to
be
one
of
his
last
at
microsoft
allen
have
discover
he
be
seriously
ill
in
late
while
on
a
business
trip
in
paris
with
james
towne
scott
oki
and
a
couple
of
others
from
microsoft
he
have
to
excuse
himself
during
a
meeting
to
return
to
his
hotel
room
because
he
be
feverish
allen
told
the
others
he
fear
this
be
something
more
serious
than
just
the
flu
when
he
didn
t
feel
well
after
a
couple
of
day
he
go
to
consult
a
french
doctor
but
he
felt
uncomfortable
so
far
from
home
in
a
country
whose
language
he
didn
t
understand
still
run
a
high
fever
allen
left
the
others
in
paris
board
the
supersonic
concord
jetliner
at
orly
airport
and
head
back
to
seattle
the
diagnosis
take
some
time
but
after
extensive
test
doctor
determine
allen
have
hodgkin
s
disease
a
form
of
lymph
cancer
to
save
his
life
they
say
he
need
to
undergo
a
combination
of
radiation
treatment
and
chemotherapy
immediately
colleague
say
the
relationship
between
gate
and
allen
have
become
strain
even
before
allen
become
sick
this
may
have
played
a
part
in
his
decision
to
leave
microsoft
there
be
bound
to
be
problem
between
the
two
after
so
many
year
work
together
they
point
out
that
be
around
someone
as
intense
as
gate
be
difficult
even
for
short
period
of
time
it
s
almost
inevitable
when
people
work
so
close
together
say
david
bunnell
the
former
technical
writer
for
mit
who
knew
gate
and
allen
back
in
albuquerque
it
s
like
a
marriage
as
a
publisher
of
a
national
computer
magazine
bunnell
stayed
in
touch
with
the
two
after
microsoft
move
to
bellevue
they
have
very
different
personality
bunnell
say
of
gate
and
allen
paul
be
always
much
more
laid
back
all
along
i
thought
paul
want
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
success
a
lot
more
than
bill
bill
want
to
drive
on
and
on
i
think
paul
really
want
to
not
work
so
hard
i
know
he
have
a
rock
n
roll
band
he
have
a
lot
more
interest
in
just
enjoy
life
one
microsoft
manager
say
it
be
clear
to
him
in
mid
that
allen
and
gate
be
have
problem
they
be
not
get
along
there
be
a
confrontation
of
some
kind
it
happen
before
i
get
there
paul
would
much
rather
read
science
fiction
novel
play
his
guitar
and
listen
to
music
than
be
around
the
company
after
a
while
he
would
also
occasionally
take
day
off
something
gate
would
never
do
and
which
go
against
the
hardcore
work
ethic
at
microsoft
especially
at
a
time
when
everyone
be
put
in
hour
day
rather
than
discuss
their
difference
with
each
other
directly
gate
and
allen
communicate
primarily
through
electronic
message
or
e
mail
accord
to
another
company
manager
employee
would
almost
never
see
allen
in
gate
office
although
steve
ballmer
be
in
there
a
lot
when
ask
about
speculation
that
he
and
gate
have
have
a
fall
out
allen
reply
that
s
bullshit
a
deeply
sensitive
man
allen
seem
genuinely
hurt
that
anyone
at
microsoft
would
think
he
didn
t
want
to
work
as
hard
as
everyone
else
he
be
receive
radiation
and
chemotherapy
treatment
he
point
out
while
continue
to
work
and
this
be
why
he
wasn
t
around
at
time
in
fact
allen
use
to
joke
with
friend
at
microsoft
about
his
hair
fall
out
some
in
the
company
do
not
even
know
he
be
sick
allen
although
a
captivate
conversationalist
be
a
very
private
man
and
never
one
to
explain
his
feeling
of
his
relationship
with
gate
at
the
time
allen
say
there
certainly
be
time
when
bill
and
i
have
our
difference
sure
it
be
intense
we
didn
t
always
see
eye
to
eye
but
what
always
come
out
in
the
end
be
productive
allen
do
acknowledge
that
the
illness
change
his
outlook
on
life
and
that
s
why
he
decide
to
leave
the
company
for
a
while
i
just
need
to
get
away
from
work
you
have
to
strike
a
balance
between
work
and
enjoy
the
other
thing
in
life
microsoft

never
make
such
a
statement
for
gate

today

his
team
have
developed
microsoft

specifically
for
the

concerned
the

broken
into
module
that
could

something
which
wasn

very
good
that

gate
he
knew
it
be
just
a
matter
of
time
before

of

of
late
he

much
faster
high

have
good
lawyer
who
have
be
able
to
get
some
of
his
speed
ticket
dismiss
on
technicality
but
his
drive
record
be
poor
he
be
in
danger
of
lose
his
license
on
the
way

with
rubinstein

explain
that
he
have
a

detector
in
his
porsche
he
felt
the
police
officer
have
give
him
a
speed
ticket
because
he
saw
the
device
gate
be
go
to
argue
with
the
judge
that
he
be
within
his
right
to
have
the
radar
detector
rubinstein
give
the
combative
gate
some
friendly
advice
i
told
bill
you
may
very
well
be
within
your
right
to
have
a
radar
detector
in
your
fast
porsche
but
the
fact
be
they
won
t
like
it
because
they
ll
think
the
principal
reason
that
you
have
it
be
to
escape
the
law
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
be
to
tell
them
that
you
be
go
to
throw
away
your
radar
detector
that
you

really
sorry
about
what
you
do
and
that
you

not
go

anymore
otherwise
they
be
go
to

and
as
a
result
he
get
off
with
only
a
fine
not
long
after
his
day
in

worried
he
would
lose
his
license
if
he
didn
t
slow
down
bought
a
sluggish
mercedes
diesel
sedan
he
say
the
car
be
a
good
test
of
his
mental
discipline
because
it
be
so
slow
and
there
be
no
radio
to
distract
his
think
actually
the
mercedes
just
take
a
bit
longer
to
get
up
to
high
speed
gate
push
it
hard
too
and
rack
up
several
more
speed
ticket
but
he
never
do
lose
his
license
the
brown
mercedes
however
be
a
topic
of
conversation
at
gate
tenth
anniversary
high
school
reunion
apparently
gate
have
forgotten
to
put
oil
in
the
mercedes
and
have
burn
up
the
engine
the
mercedes
be
soon
repair
nonetheless
gate
continued
to
use
the
porsche
for
late
night
drive
when
he
need
to
do
some
serious
think
jonathan
prusky
who
be
hire
by
microsoft
in
to
work
on
word
recall
gate
tell
him
that
he
would
go
out
late
at
night
and
drive
the

limit
down
the
express
lane
of
interstate
the
main
interstate
through
seattle
check
for

and
then
would
roar
back
through
the
stretch
at
mile
per
hour
if
the
coast
be
clear
no
doubt
gate
wish
microsoft
word
could
run
as
fast
as
the
porsche
word
be
in
beta
test
when
the

decide
the

ran
far
too
slowly
richard
brodie
chief
coder
for
word
along
with
simonyi
work
for
week
to
make
it
faster
but
gate
pointedly
told
him
it
wasn
t
good
enough
somehow
over
the
next
weekend
brodie
be
able
to
make
it
two
to
three
time
faster
accord
to
prusky
but
it
still
wasn
t
particularly
fast
bill
wasn
t
really
involve
in
the
design
of
the
product
contrary
to
some
stuff
that
i
ve
read
say
brodie
i
do
almost
all
the
cod
initially
bill
saw
it
after
it
be
pretty
much
do
and
try
it
out
as
he
like
to
do
he
sent
e
mail
back
with
about
thing
he
didn
t
like
about
it
so
i
take
the
e
mail
and
not
know
any
well
i
start
work
on
what
he
want
the
next
time
i
saw
bill
he
be
really
surprised
because
evidently
it
be
the
first
time
anyone
have
ever
respond
like
that
to
a
piece
of
e
mail
people
get
e
mail
from
him
all
the
time
but
this
be
the
first
time
anyone
have
ever
do
anything
about
it
when
microsoft
word
be
release
several
month
after
the
comdex
show
in
atlanta
microsoft
use
a
glitzy
million

to
market
the

that
include
a

a

promotional

microsoft

to
distribute

the
company
make
a

with

david

the

diskette
be
distribute
through
the

offer
the
promotional
campaign
for
word
be
part
of
an
aggressive
sale
approach
by
rowland
hanson
the
new
member
of
the
microsoft
management
team
before
he
arrive
at
microsoft
in
early
hanson
be
vice
president
of
marketing
for
neutrogena
corporation
which
make
soap
and
other
product
he
have
also
be
marketing
manager
for
general
mill
why
not
market
software
like
the
cosmetic
industry
market
soap
he
suggest
and
provide
some
free
sample
hanson
knew
nothing
about
computer
but
he
do
know
a
thing
or
two
about
soap
and
marketing
gate
decision
to
bring
in
an
outsider
to
the
computer
industry
reflect
the
grow
emphasis
he
place
on
marketing
microsoft
be
in
the
midst
of
its
transition
from
be
a
language
and
operating
system
company
to
one
sell
application
into
the
retail
market
it
be
not
enough
just
to
develop
good
software
microsoft
have
to
make
customer
want
to
buy
it
too
if
you
think
about
it
say
hanson
who
understands
brand
well
than
the
cosmetic
industry
look
at
the
halo
around
clinique
or
neutrogena
these
company
be
brand
dominate
if
their
brand
isn
t
strong
then
nothing
else
matter
because
there
isn
t
reality
to
cosmetic
soap
be
soap
at
microsoft
hanson
s
job
title
be
vice
president
of
corporate
communication
which
involve
all
advertising
public
relation
and
production
service
anything
and
everything
pertain
to
packaging
merchandising
and
marketing
microsoft
s
product
word
be
originally
go
to
be
release
as
multi
tool
word
a
continuation
of
the
multi
tool
application
product
line
that
be
to
follow
multiplan
hanson
suggest
a
different
product
name
strategy
it
be
important
for
a
product
to
be
identify
by
its
brand
name
he
point
out
microsoft
have
to
get
its
name
associate
with
its
product
just
like
neutrogena
hanson
later
elaborate
on
the
concept
in
this
way
if
you
look
back
at
some
of
the
old
article
that
be
write
in
the
industry
you
ll
see
the
word
multiplan
but
no
microsoft
associate
with
it
that
be
because
multiplan
be
a
stand
alone
name
it
start
to
take
on
its
own
meaning
beyond
microsoft
just
like
wordstar
people
who
want
a
word
processing
program
knew
the
name
wordstar
but
they
could
not
have
told
you
micropro
be
the
company
that
make
it
hanson
want
to
make
microsoft
the
sara
lee
of
the
software
industry
everyone
knew
the
sara
lee
brand
regardless
of
whether
they
be
shopping
for
apple
pie
or
pound
cake
the
brand
be
the
hero
hanson
say
people
start
to
associate
certain
image
with
the
brand
and
that
becomes
much
more
important
than
any
single
product
what
the
consumer
good
company
realize
year
ago
be
that
product
come
and
go
you
be
go
to
have
a
product
and
it
s
go
to
rise
and
fall
but
if
you
can
create
a
halo
around
a
brand
name
and
create
equity
in
a
brand
when
you
introduce
new
product
under
that
brand
halo
it
becomes
much
easy
to
create
synergy
momentum
we
decide
that
we
need
to
make
microsoft
the
hero
gate
immediately
saw
the
logic
of
hanson
s
argument
as
a
result
of
hanson
s
effort
the
multi
tool
name
be
thrown
out
take
their
place
be
microsoft
word
microsoft
plan
microsoft
chart
and
microsoft
file
the
strategy
work
as
hanson
have
hop
word
become
know
as
a
microsoft
product
unfortunately
the
first
version
of
word
for
the
pc
be
a
fairly
mediocre
program
and
review
be
mixed
word
be
widely
criticize
for
be
too
technical
and
difficult
to
learn
sale
while
healthy
enough
to
put
word
into
the
top
of
the
best
sell
software
product
on
the
market
be
below
expectation
accord
to
simonyi
word
be
too
far
ahead
of
its
time
some
of
the
concept
such
as
the
mouse
be
intimidate
to
user
and
simonyi
take
the
blame
for
incorrectly
insist
that
word
use
publishing
industry
jargon
such
as
folio
which
he
later
believe
contribute
to
the
slow
start
there
be
no
question
that
version
one
of
word
or
version
one
of
multiplan
weren
t
the
incredible
success
other
program
in
their
category
be
simonyi
say
they
be
tactical
disappointment
but
i
think
they
be
fantastic
strategic
success
microsoft
would
eventually
get
word
right
but
it
take
several
major
revision
this
would
become
a
pattern
with
most
of
the
company
s
initial
application
product
for
the
ibm
pc
and
compatible
computer
vern
raburn
former
president
of
microsoft
s
consumer
product
division
discuss
this
aspect
of
microsoft
in
fortune
magazine
with
few
exception
they
ve
never
ship
a
good
product
in
its
first
version
but
they
never
give
up
and
eventually
get
it
right
bill
be
too
willing
to
compromise
just
to
get
go
in
a
business
in
a
sense
it
be
all
part
of
gate
master
plan
as
that
master
of
military
combat
tactic
general
george
s
patton
like
to
say
a
good
plan
violently
execute
now
be
well
than
a
perfect
plan
next
week
in
hire
roland
hanson
an
industry
outsider
for
a
key
executive
position
at
microsoft
gate
be
take
something
of
a
risk
at
a
critical
juncture
in
the
company
s
development
gate
have
gamble
similarly
on
his
new
president
james
towne
and
the
gamble
have
not
paid
off
in
an
interview
with
business
week
in
may
of
towne
dismiss
report
of
serious
tension
between
him
and
gate
we
be
go
through
a
transition
process
from
a
centrally
organize
outfit
to
something
where
others
have
more
responsibility
but
not
long
after
that
interview
towne
be
go
microsoft
s
first
president
have
last
just
month
gate
would
later
say
that
towne
be
sort
of
random
a
favorite
techie
expression
use
at
microsoft
meaning
confuse
or
haphazard
behavior
and
usually
use
to
describe
someone
you
didn
t
like
towne
have
decline
comment
on
why
he
left
microsoft
gate
too
have
say
very
little
but
base
on
interview
with
other
manager
at
microsoft
during
towne
s
tenure
a
reveal
picture
emerges
of
two
people
who
come
to
dislike
each
other
intensely
the
part
be
far
less
amicable
than
it
be
portrayed
in
the
press
and
by
both
party
the
crux
of
the
matter
be
that
towne
never
gain
gate
respect
he
just
wasn
t
technically
proficient
enough
to
talk
byte
and
bit
with
gate
who
live
in
the
strange
rarefy
language
of
computer
i
come
aboard
about
the
time
towne
do
say
raymond
bily
jim
come
in
from
a
corporate
environment
at
tektronix
to
help
microsoft
through
some
of
the
growth
stage
and
he
felt
very
strongly
that
professionally
train
manager
need
to
be
in
management
position
and
bill
felt
strongly
that
technologist
need
to
be
manage
technical
people
it
be
a
question
of
whether
this
company
be
go
to
be
technology
driven
or
management
driven
others
say
towne
only
want
to
bring
traditional
management
practice
into
the
business
side
of
the
company
not
into
the
more
creative
software
development
area
that
gate
handle
the
part
of
the
company
that
need
creative
organization
be
software
development
one
manager
say
they
have
always
be
difficult
to
manage
that
be
always
under
bill
he
could
motivate
those
guy
but
the
other
side
of
the
company
the
financial
organization
really
didn
t
require
all
that
much
creativity
there
be
deeper
problem
however
than
just
difference
in
management
philosophy
towne
be
never
invite
into
microsoft
s
inner
sanctum
of
power
which
at
the
time
include
only
gate
and
ballmer
although
ballmer
officially
report
to
towne
on
the
management
chart
towne
be
often
left
out
of
the
decision
make
he
would
learn
week
later
of
something
that
have
be
decide
by
gate
and
ballmer
at
in
the
morning
part
of
the
problem
be
that
their
lifestyle
didn
t
mesh
towne
be
year
old
and
with
a
wife
and
two
kid
at
home
he
understandably
want
to
spend
time
with
them
gate
have
no
such
desire
or
obligation
he
would
get
increasingly
intense
late
at
night
about
the
time
towne
be
head
out
the
door
for
his
home
bill
would
say
that
some
of
his
best
time
be
sit
in
his
office
at
a
m
say
one
microsoft
manager
who
work
with
towne
bill
felt
well
then
than
any
other
time
know
his
company
be
work
and
towne
wasn
t
around
a
lot
of
those
hour
he
be
with
his
family
after
stay
up
most
of
the
night
gate
would
often
be
late
for
important
morning
meeting
which
irritated
towne
he
once
complain
to
a
colleague
that
gate
be
immature
at
time
he
felt
more
like
a
babysitter
than
a
company
president
once
as
gate
and
towne
be
leave
an
industry
trade
show
gate
told
towne
he
have
left
his
bag
in
his
room
and
ask
towne
to
fetch
them
when
towne
enter
the
room
he
found
gate
dirty
underwear
on
the
floor
and
his
clothes
scatter
helter
skelter
he
have
to
pick

have
to
do
bill
admit
lot
of
time
he
need
to
grow
up
but
he
didn
t
know
how
say
one
microsoft
executive
who
be
with
the
company
when
towne
left
frankly
he
need
a
big
brother
more
than
he
need
a
president
after
a
while
the
two
avoid
each
other
whenever
possible
towne
felt
his
meeting
with
others
in
the
company
go
much
well
when
gate
be
not
around
but
it
be
clearly
not
a
healthy
situation
both
men
knew
it
wasn
t
work
out
one
friday
morning
gate
call
towne
into
his
office
and
inform

nine
month
to
find
another

of
the
year
gate
assume
the
role
of
company
president
once
again
after
towne
depart
but
he
understood
the
mistake
he
have
make
in
hire
towne
from
the
start
there
have
never
be
any
rapport
between
the
two
gate
need
to
find
someone
he
already
knew
someone
he
like
and
felt
comfortable
with
that
be
as
important
as
a
candidate
s
managerial
and
technical
acumen
in
jon
shirley
a
vice
president
of
the
tandy
corporation
in
texas
gate
found
both
a
friend
and
someone
knowledgeable
about
the
industry
unlike
a
lot
of
corporate
executive
gate
be
able
to
put
his
ego
aside
look
at
himself
honestly
and
to
learn
from
his
mistake
he
knew
he
have
make
a
mistake
in
hire
towne
in
hire
shirley
he
would
not
make
that
mistake
a
second
time
as
you
watch
how
microsoft
have
developed
what
you
see
be
gate
realize
well
in
advance
what
he
s
not
good
at
and
go
out
and
find
exactly
the
right
person
to
do
the
job
say
stewart
alsop
a
respect
industry
observer
and
longtime
gate
admirer
who
writes
a
national
computer
newsletter
this
be
so
rare
i
ve
be
follow
startup
company
for
year
i
can
t
tell
you
how
rare
this
be
look
at
what
happen
with
james
towne
gate
be
told
that
as
the
founder
of
the
company
what
he
need
be
a
management
guy
someone
to
organize
the
company
so
he
found
towne
but
gate
realize
quickly
that
towne
be
not
take
into
account
the
history
and
culture
of
microsoft
he
be
organize
microsoft
in
a
classical
way
rather
than
as
it
should
have
be
run
he
realize
towne
be
not
bad
but
that
he
gate
have
make
a
mistake
and
towne
be
the
wrong
guy
for
the
job
so
gate
go
out
and
hire
jon
shirley
and
he
be
absolutely
the
right
guy
the
process
of
identify
the
mistake
figure
out
the
problem
and
fix
it
be
what
make
bill
gate
different
i
ve
watch
him
do
it
over
and
over
again
shirley
arrive
at
microsoft
in
august
of
after
year
with
the
tandy
corporation
where
he
have
earn
a
reputation
as
a
tremendous
organizer
know
for
his
toughness
and
efficiency
he
have
most
recently
be
a
vice
president
of
computer
merchandising
at
tandy
he
have
also
work
in
sale
international
operation
and
manufacturing
at
shirley
be
five
year
old
than
towne
but
he
and
gate
have
know
each
other
for
year
and
have
negotiate
many
time
across
the
table
the
two
have
work
closely
during
the
previous
year
on
the
model
portable
computer
they
like
each
other
despite
the
fact
that
shirley
in
an
interview
a
couple
month
before
he
join
microsoft
have
say
of
gate
he
can
be
difficult
to
work
with
gate
knew
and
respect
shirley
enough
that
he
trust
him
to
run
part
of
microsoft
without
gate
direct
supervision
this
freed
gate
to
concentrate
more
on
the
development
side
of
microsoft
and
less
on
day
to
day
administrative
matter
the
two
men
have
very
different
personality
gate
be
intense
and
energetic
like
a
shark
always
on
the
move
the
dour
pipe
smoking
shirley
on
the
other
hand
be
quiet
and
contain
prefer
cold
logic
to
hot
emotion
he
have
a
nononsense
approach
to
business
if
you
present
something
to
jon
the
emotion
would
stay
out
of
it
say
one
of
the
first
manager
shirley
hire
a
lot
of
people
found
that
very
cold
and
be
put
off
by
it
i
like
it
shirley
brought
a
calmer
more
mature
management
style
to
microsoft
he
be
the
perfect
complement
to
the
combative
gate
when
diplomatic
skill
be
need
he
have
a
temper
role
with
others
in
the
industry
when
relationship
with
gate
become
too
tense
shirley
be
a
very
easy
guy
to
work
with
easy
guy
to
talk
to
say
raymond
bily
he
help
round
out
the
team
he
wasn
t
like
bill
or
steve
ballmer
he
have
kid
glove
he
be
more
able
to
make
you
feel
good
about
a
bad
decision
and
redirect
your
effort
when
he
join
microsoft
shirley
go
to
work
immediately
on
the
company
s
numerous
organizational
and
managerial
weakness
he
restructure
the
retail
sale
force
tap
ballmer
as
a
vice
president
of
marketing
shirley
want
to
well
utilize
ballmer
s
brand
management
experience
from
his
day
at
procter
gamble
shirley
found
new
supplier
and
cut
microsoft
s
manufacturing
cost
by
percent
as
towne
have
discover
during
his
tenure
the
marketing
people
have
little
idea
how
much
product
they
could
sell
shirley
order
production
base
on
day
projection
instead
of
annual
projection
this
soon
eliminate
a
huge
backlog
of
unfilled
order
and
shirley
finally
do
something
about
the
stone
age
computer
system
use
by
accounting
secure
with
his
new
president
in
place
gate
could
now
turn
his
attention
to
what
would
prove
to
be
microsoft
s
most
ambitious
and
difficult
undertaking
the
development
of
window
a
software
program
that
gate
hop
would
make
computer
easy
to
use
than
ever
before
easy
enough
in
fact
for
his
mother
to
use
what
gate
couldn
t
foresee
in
be
that
his
vision
would
consume
the
labor
of
as
many
as
of
his
best
programmer
for
the
next
two
year
while
they
work
around
the
clock
on
make
gate
vision
a
reality
before
the
first
version
of
window
be
finish
those
programmer
would
spend
some
work
year
design
write
and
test
window
in
contrast
to
the
work
year
investment
originally
approve
by
ballmer
gate
ability
to
manage
complicate
development
program
would
be
severely
test
as
would
his
relationship
with
his
closest
adviser
several
of
his
hand
picked
manager
would
quit
unable
to
tolerate
the
scream
fit
he
and
ballmer
threw
as
the
project
slip
embarrassingly
behind
schedule
microsoft
would
be
reorganize
a
year
into
the
project
to
improve
efficiency
but
it
would
nonetheless
suffer
its
first
significant
loss
of
credibility
with
the
press
and
the
public
a
few
computer
writer
would
even
venture
that
gate
have
badly
blunder
when
he
chose
to
champion
graphical
user
interface
in
time
gate
would
prove
them
wrong
but
a
new
decade
would
have
dawn
before
window
finally
live
up
to
its
promise
with
window
gate
intend
to
draw
on
technology
developed
in
the
early
s
at
the
palo
alto
research
center
that
fountainhead
of
creativity
that
give
birth
to
the
alto
and
star
computer
in
the
summer
of
steve
job
have
give
gate
a
peek
at
the
prototype
of
a
new
computer
apple
be
develop
the
macintosh
which
use
gui
concept
developed
at
the
xerox
research
center
later
that
year
microsoft
formally
begin
a
gui
project
of
its
own
call
interface
manager
gate
have
his
own
vision
of
what
the
program
should
do
popular
software
application
program
each
have
a
unique
way
of
work
on
a
computer
user
could
not
easily
switch
from
wordstar
to
visicalc
for
example
because
the
command
to
print
a
file
or
move
text
be
different
gate
want
interface
manager
to
be
sandwich
between
m
do
and
application
by
act
as
an
interpreter
for
user
interface
manager
would
make
different
application
program
look
the
same
and
user
could
operate
them
in
nearly
the
same
way
the
display
screen
would
be
divide
up
into
individual
window
so
several
different
application
could
be
view
simultaneously
development
of
interface
manager
proceed
in
secret
at
microsoft
along
those
line
throughout
by
the
middle
of
the
year
however
it
be
become
clear
that
other
software
company
be
develop
gui
program
of
their
own
for
the
ibm
personal
computer
at
the
fall
comdex
trade
show
in
visicorp
announce
it
be
work
on
something
call
vision
this
represent
a
double
whammy
for
microsoft
charles
simonyi
have
already
see
the
swift
new
lotus
spreadsheet
at
the
show
when
he
get
a
look
at
vision
it
appear
very
similar
to
microsoft
s
own
effort
to
develop
interface
manager
not
long
afterwards
in
the
early
day
of
apple
introduce
lisa
the
first
personal
computer
with
a
graphical
interface
and
mouse
it
have
be
under
development
since
job
have
hire
away
one
of
parc
s
top
scientist
to
work
on
the
lisa

generate
quite
a
buzz
in
the
trade
publication
notwithstanding
its
price
tag
unwilling
to
let
visicorp
steal
a
march
on
microsoft
gate
hint
to
the
press
in
january
that
microsoft
would
ship
a
product
before
visicorp
could
bring
vision
to
market
the
promise
be
make
week
before
a
prototype
of
interface
manager
have
even
run
on
an
ibm
pc
it
be
the
first
of
several
pronouncement
that
would
later
embarrass
microsoft
a
graphical
user
interface
be
the
linchpin
in
gate
strat
egy
to
overtake
lotus
in
the
application
business
the
plan
be
twofold
by
write
program
for
the
macintosh
which
be
still
under
secret
development
microsoft
would
get
the
jump
on
other
software
developer
in
create
application
for
the
graphical
environment
and
if
gate
could
make
microsoft
s
interface
manager
the
industry
standard
for
the
ibm
pc
he
could
shift
million
of
do
user
over
to
his
application
rather
than
those
developed
by
lotus
to
establish
an
interface
standard
gate
have
to
get
other
software
publisher
to
agree
to
write
application
program
that
would
support
microsoft
in
the
graphical
environment
he
also
need
to
convince
the
big
personal
computer
manufacturer
to
sell
microsoft
s
interface
manager
with
their
machine
with
characteristic
zeal
gate
spent
month
sell
computer
manufacturer
and
software
developer
on
his
vision
of
gui
one
software
company
executive
recall
that
in
early
gate
paid
to
fly
him
and
a
colleague
to
microsoft
gate
want
to
convince
them
to
write
program
development
tool
for
interface
manager
rather
than
to
work
with
lotus
on
develop
tool
for
he
walk
us
all
around
seattle
and
told
us
about
this
grand
scheme
the
executive
say
he
be
do
multiplan
multifile
and
right
in
the
middle
of
it
be
this
graphical
user
interface
he
say
it
be
go
to
be
do
in
a
year
it
be
rowland
hanson
who
come
up
with
the
name
window
in
place
of
interface
manager
at
the
time
trade
article
about
graphical
user
interface
described
the
concept
as
a
windowing
system
even
vision
be
described
in
that
manner
it
appear
there
be
go
to
be
multiple
system
like
this
on
the
market
hanson
say
well
we
want
to
have
our
name
basically
define
the
generic
but
a
catchy
name
by
itself
wouldn
t
make
window
a
winner
microsoft
be
be
outflank
on
several
front
by
competitor
that
be
far
along
in
the
development
of
their
own
gui
system
bad
gate
be
have
a
tough
time
sell
ibm
on
the
product
more
than
other
computer
maker
include
compaq
and
radio
shack
have
indicate
their
willingness
to
endorse
window
but
there
be
one
name
conspicuously
absent
from
the
window
alliance
ibm
gate
want
big
blue
to
endorse
window
but
it
refuse
to
do
so
ibm
executive
never
particularly
happy
about
share
revenue
with
another
company
want
to
bring
software
development
in
house
ibm
decide
to
design
its
own
graphical
user
interface
call
topview
clearly
microsoft
need
more
firepower
to
counter
the
grow
threat
as
steve
job
have
do
before
him
gate
look
to
xerox
parc
for
software
developer
experienced
in
gui
who
could
put
the
spur
to
window

might
be
induced
to
leave

for
more
amiable
surroundings
macgregor
prematurely
bald
with
a
scholarly
air
about
him
head
a
small
software
engineering
team
that
help
create
the
windowing
system
for
the
xerox
star
when
simonyi
call
macgregor
agree
to
an
interview
after
talk
by
phone
with
gate
although
he
be
only
vaguely
aware
of
microsoft
his
curiosity
be
pique
when
gate
hint
he
want
to
talk
to
him
about
a
graphical
user
interface
for
personal
computer
their
dinner
conversation
that
night
come
easily
despite
the
distraction
of
the
belly
dancer
recall
macgregor
there
be
a
relatively
small
number
of
people
in
the
industry
who
understand
idea
very
quickly
and
one
of
the
thing
i
like
be
if
somebody
be
really
smart
and
understands
what
you
re
say
you
can
complete
each
other
s
sentence
you
start
speak
in
an
abbreviate
way
bill
and
i
hit
it
off
right
away
i
think
he
conclude
i
knew
something
about
window
and
i
think
i
conclude
he
knew
something
about
the
pc
industry
and
have
some
vision
and
goal
he
want
to
get
do
both
found
they
share
an
enthusiasm
for
the
possibility
of
a
windowing
system
that
could
make
personal
computer
far
more
accessible
to
the
average
office
worker
and
home
user
the
star
have
incorporate
all
the
feature
necessary
for
an
electronic
replica
of
a
typical
office
set
icon
menu
multiple
window
symbolize
the
desktop
file
cabinet
telephone
in
and
out
box
and
wastepaper
basket
data
could
be
coaxed
in
and
out
of
the
computer
with
a
mouse
software
combine
text
and
graphic
into
one
document
and
the
system
be
design
so
that
what
the
user
saw
on
the
screen
be
what
come
out
in
hard
copy
when
the
print
command
be
give
it
all
sound
very
much
like
what
gate
envision
for
window
we
talk
about
window
and
how
we
be
go
to
change
the
world
while
watch
a
belly
dancer
do
her
thing
say
macgregor
i
think
bill
in
a
sense
realize
gui
be
something
that
be
important
that
he
really
didn
t
know
enough
about
he
figure
he
well
get
something
in
place
fast
because
all
his
competitor
be
do
it
apple
be
drive
forward
on
the
macintosh
as
be
some
of
the
other
competitor
like
visicorp
and
digital
research
i
think
he
didn
t
quite
understand
it
but
he
didn
t
want
to
be
blindside
by
this
one
macgregor
visit
microsoft
a
couple
of
time
before
he
agree
to
sign
on
to
head
the
new
window
engineering
team
on
macgregor
s
first
day
at
work
he
and
gate
talk
about
a
name
for
the
development
team
they
finally
settle
on
the
interactive
system
group
around
the
same
time
gate
be
woo
macgregor
he
hire
two
more
people
from
xerox
a
talented
programmer
name
dan
lipkie
and
leo
nikora
a
management
veteran
of
the
star
project
with
year
of
software
program
experience
find
xerox
defector
wasn
t
difficult
macgregor
and
nikora
like
simonyi
before
them
have
grown
disillusion
with
the
fact
that
so
many
good
idea
developed
by
parc
never
get
to
market
or
fail
when
they
do
so
xerox
be
the
epitome
of
corporate
culture
say
nikora
everything
be
run
by
committee
and
there
be
not
too
much
individuality
and
i
m
talk
about
the
creative
side
of
xerox
microsoft
on
the
other
hand
be
a
bunch
of
individualist
with
the
whole
show
run
minute
to
minute
by
bill
gate
he
be
in
on
eyery
decision
from
top
to
bottom
nikora
decide
to
leave
xerox
when
he
watch
the
star
crash
and
burn
after
year
of
painstaking
evolution
he
felt
the
fault
lay
not
in
product
design
but
in
marketing
and
decide
it
be
time
for
a
career
move
the
first
person
he
call
be
gate
who
he
remember
from
the

be
particularly
impressed
with

not
just
a
brilliant
programmer
and
technical
person

like
so

visicorp

follow
by
one
from
quarterdeck
a
startup
software
publisher
that
announce
it
too
would
build

and
microsoft
begin
to
take
on
the
look
of

also
ran
gate
be
furious
to
steal
some
of
the
spotlight
from

and
quarterdeck
he
order
that

be
formally
announce
within
two
week
macgregor
be
airborne
with
gate
head
for

gate
felt
he
couldn
t
afford
to
keep
window
under
wrap
any
longer
he
have
learn
that
one
way
to
prevent
potential
customer
from
flock
to
a
competitor
s
product
be
to
announce
that
your
company
be
work
on
something
even
well
it
be
a
try
and
true
ibm
gambit
that
work
well
when
customer
look
to
your
firm
to
set
standard
they
usually
would
gladly
wait
for
the
market
leader
s
product
to
come
out
infoworld
magazine
would
later
coin
a
term
for
such
a
product
vaporware
there
seem
to
be
this
notion
that
since
all
of
our
competitor
be
announce
product
that
be
vaporware
we
have
to
have
one
too
recall
one
microsoft
manager
of
the
decision
to
announce
window
gate
have
other
motif
as
well
he
knew
the
still
secret
macintosh
with
its
graphical
user
interface
and
mouse
be
go
to
shake
up
the
industry
when
it
be
release
early
in
and
by
announce
window
now
microsoft
could
make
a
preemptive
strike
gate
want
the
industry
to
know
microsoft
be
surf
the
curl
of
the
break
gui
groundswell
not
languish
in
the
backwash
the
announcement
would
also
help
to
neutralize
not
just
compete
software
publisher
but
also
ibm
big
blue
have
recently
move
away
from

they

too
happy
to

behind

put
on
a

show
what
the
finish
product
would
be
able
to
do
at
least
in
theory
it
wasn
t
an
unprecedented
display
of
the
power
of
gui
but
the
idea
that
you
could
get
a
clunky

be
consider
reasonably
amaze
take
his
place
at
the
podium
gate
explain
to
the
press
that
window
would
end
the
problem
of
compatibility
of

once

for

and
that
it
would
be
able
to
run

do
the
statement
be
an

head
off

there

on
the
horizon
at

people
to
believe
that
window
would
make
integrate
software
obsolete
by
the
end
of
gate
boldly
predict
as
he
stood
center
stage

up
his
boxy
glass
window
would
be
use
on
more
than
percent
of
all
ibm
compatible
computer
it
be
a
brash
prophecy
that
microsoft
and
particularly
the
fledgling
window
development
team
would
come
to
greatly
regret
the

ballmer
told
infoworld
magazine
in
a
interview
whenever
you
meet
a
kick
as
guy
get
him
do
we
have
a
head
count
budget
no
way
there
be
some
guy
you
meet
only
once
in
a
lifetime
so
why
screw
around
job
candidate
be
often
ask
difficult
question
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
program
ballmer
like
to
find
out
quickly
how
smart
someone
be
and
in
the
middle
of
an
interview
he
would
fire
a
logic
problem
at
the
prospective
employee
try
to
throw
the
person
off
balance
you
don
t
have
to
be
a
programmer
to
tell
if
someone
be
smart
say
ballmer
ballmer
sometimes
ask
game
theory
question
he
would
ask
the
job
candidate
a
basic
question
and
once
that
be
answer
he
would
take
them
through
harder
and
harder
variation
of
the
question
what
we
be
interested
in
be
not
just
if
someone
knew
the
answer
but
could
they
think
say
one
senior
microsoft
programmer
who
make
recruiting
trip
to
college
campus
in
a
lot
of
bright
people
don
t
always
do
well
in
microsoft
interview
because
they
can
t
handle
the
pressure
the
first
person
you
interview
with
have
the
first
say
on
whether
you
get
the
job
if
you
don
t
do
well
that
s
the
end
of
the
road
microsoft
recruiter
have
to
change
their
question
from
time
to
time
because
student
who
didn
t
get
a
job
would
tell
their
friend
what
question
have
be
ask
and
the
word
spread
quickly
from
campus
to
campus
although
ballmer
interviewed
all
software
developer
hire
at
microsoft
gate
and
other
senior
technical
people
from
the
company
would
often
accompany
him
on
recruiting
trip
and
ask
the
tough
technical
question
we
would
rip
people
to
piece
say
mcgregor
we
would
ask
them
very
difficult
technical
question
hand
them
a
piece
of
paper
and
pen
and
say
solve
this
problem
we
probably
lose
some
people
but
the
people
we
do
hire
be
good
at

although
it

unclear
how
the
tradition
start
some
worker
bought
them
by
the
gross
and
it
wasn
t
unusual
for
programmer
to
arrive
in
the
morning
and
find
them
on
their
keyboard
in
coffee
cup
in
their

a
special
room
just
for
juggling
microsoft

programmer
who
by
late
numbered
more
than

that
stage
in

there
be
a
lot
of
respect
for
a
young
kid
right
out
of
college
the
software
engineer
be
the
lifeblood
of
the
company
if
you
want
to
surround
yourself
with
world
class
engineer
give
them
the
respect
that
they
need
friedman
be
particularly
impressed
that
gate
not

knew
the
name
and
face
of
every

but
also
their
telephone

he
have
memorize
every

the
manager
didn
t
think
that
gate
have
try
to
memorize
them
he
just
notice
them
and
remember
friedman
s
office
be
only
five
door
down
from
gate
who
be
very
visible
and
often
talk
shop
with
programmer
in
the
hallway
late
at
night
about
project
they
be
work
on
the
management
structure
on
the
creative
side
of
the

be
purposefully
very
flat
there
be
no
middle
manager
get
in
the
way
of
access
to
bill
as
everyone
call
him
just
be
able
to
see
gate
in
the
hallway
be
important
to
many
of
the
young
programmer
who
have
join
microsoft
s
crusade
gate
be
become
a
cult
figure
in
the
industry
at
microsoft
he
be
a
hero
it
be
little
wonder
that
as
they
idolize
him
the
programmer
also
emulate
him
within
the
industry
story
abound
of
microsoft
programmer
and
executive
who
become
gate
clone
adopt
his
speech
pattern
his
mannerism
even
his
trademark
quirk
that
oddball
rock
tic
i
know
people
who
come
back
from
work
at
microsoft
say
an
executive
with
a
rival
software
company
and
they
have
this
expression
to
describe
the
influence
gate
have
there
and
their
expression
be
if
bill
say
drink
kool
aid
they
would
do
it
this
be
not
flattery
the
description
allude

as

who
be
very
much
the

and
the
people
who
run

the

you
just
go

there
would
be
time
when
people
would
work
more
than
we
want
them
to
and
we
would
try
to
get
them
to
slow
down
but
sometimes
you
couldn
t
get
them
to
stop
when
they
collapse
you
cover
them
with
a
blanket
and
turn
off
the

sometimes
we
would
try
to
lock
them
out
of
their
office
temporarily
add

i
saw
kid
you
know
who
work
at
microsoft
for
a
few
year
and
truly
i
wonder
if
they
would
ever
be
able
to
work
again
there
be
a
story
that
circulates
in
the
industry
that
gate
at
one
time
require
his
manager
to
park
in
the
order
they
arrive
for
work
in
the
morning
no
one
want
to
leave
until
the
person
who
have
arrive
earlier
and
park
in
the
space
next
to
them
have
slump
exhaust
behind
the
wheel
arid
driven
home
microsoft
official
insist
the
story
be
apocryphal
but
mark
eisner
president
of
softbridge
microsystems
a
massachusetts
software
company
remember
visit
gate
in
we
be
walk
out
of
the
building
about
o
clock
at
night
and
a
programmer
be
just
signing
out
for
the
day
he
say
hey
bill
i
ve
be
here
for
hour
and
bill
look
at
him
and
say
ahhhhh
work
halfdays
again
it
be
funny
but
you
could
tell
bill
be
half
serious
gate
often
wore
his
people
down
not
just
by
his
own
personal
tenacity
but
also
by
his
sometimes
shock
lack
of
diplomacy
in
discussion
he
wield
his
formidable
intellect
like
a
blunt
instrument
he
could
be
rude
and
sarcastic
even
insult
when
he
want
to
make
a
point
if
angered
say
one
ex
employee
he
become
apoplectic
for
many
programmer
attend
a
technical
staff
meeting
with
gate
be
like
go
through
an
oral
examination
with
a
verbal
executioner
he
have
the
uncanny
ability
to
spot
the
weak
link
in
even
the
most
logical
argument
show
him
the
mona
lisa
and
he
would
see
the
errant
brush
stroke
once
the
flaw
be
pinpoint
he
would
rip
the
person
to
shred
hurl
favorite
insult
such
as
stupid
and
random
in
those
day
say
a
microsoft
product
manager
when
you
would
attend
a
meeting
with
him
he
d
be
rock
and
his
knee
would
be
jerking
up
and
down
and
there
s
all
this
idiosyncratic
motion
which
i
guess
be
a
channel
for
some
of
his
internal
energy
you
just
knew
there
be
a
dynamo
move
inside
he
be
a
very
clear
thinker
but
he
would
get
emotional
he
would
browbeat
people
just
impose
your
intellectual
prowess
on
somebody
doesn
t
win
the
battle
and
he
didn
t
know
that
it
may
not
be
the
right
thing
to
do
to
bash
your
point
across
but
he
didn
t
know
that
then
he
be
very
rich
and
very
immature
he
have
never
mature
emotionally

told
author
steven
levy
the
apple
engineer
who
developed
the
macintosh
have
work
miracle
gate
have
be
smitten
by
the
simplicity
of
the
mac
ever
since
he
saw
a
prototype
back
in
the
summer
of
shortly
before
ibm
announce
the

andy
hertzfeld

of

have
give
gate
the
first
demonstration
gate
be
unfamiliar
with
the
mouse
technology
use
in
the
macintosh
and
the
first
question
he
ask
hertzfeld
be
what
kind
of
hardware
be
use
to
make
the
pointer
move
around
the
screen
in
response
to
the
movement
of
the
mouse
actually
apple
have
solve
the
problem
with
software
not
hardware
i
have
gotten
a
similar
type
of
mouse
system
go
on
the
apple
ii
about
two
week
earlier
hertzfeld
recall
and
just
as
gate
ask
that
question
i
be
about
to
say
of
course
we
don
t
have
any
hardware
for
it
we
even
can
do
it
on
an
apple
ii
but
steve
job
yell
at
me
shut
up
job
want
gate
to
kno
y
as
little
as
possible
about
graphical
user
interface
software
microsoft
receive
the
first
prototype
of
the
macintosh
in
late
january
of
programmer
need
a
machine
before
they
could
design
application
for
it
in
create
the
macintosh
steve
job
have
go
shopping
at
parc
too
he
have
met
with
official
of
the
xerox
corporation
in
and
propose
a
venture
capital
deal
whereby
xerox
could
own
part
of
apple
if
job
could
get
a
peek
at
the
technology
under
development
at
its
palo
alto
research
center
job
be
quote
as
say
i
will
let
you
invest
a
million
dollar
in
apple
if
you
will
sort
of
open
the
kimono
at
xerox
parc
both
gate
and
job
obviously
knew
a
good
thing
when
they
saw
it
and
appropriate
everything
they
could
from
parc
include
its
best
mind
when
he
be
later
ask
about
the
similarity
between
window
and
the
graphic
use
in
the
macintosh
gate
kid
that
he
and
job
have
live
next
to
a
rich
neighbor
name
xerox
and
when
he
gate
broke
in
to
steal
the
television
set
he
discover
job
have
already
take
it
his
point
be
that
window
come
from
technology
developed
at
parc
not
apple
the
development
of
the
macintosh
be
something
of
a
pirate
operation
from
the
start
kept
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
company
in
a
building
that
be
know
as
texaco
tower
because
it
be
right
next
to
a
texaco
station
the
engineer
almost
all
of
them
in
their
twenty
kept
a
pirate
flag
on
the
wall
although
the
rainbow
color
apple
logo
have
replace
one
of
the
eye
in
the
pirate
skull
job
consider
the
mac
his
baby
and
later
neglect
other
part
of
the
company
to
run
the
show
but
he
have
at
first
oppose
the
project
accord
to
mac
team
leader
jeff
raskin
raskin
complain
in
a
memo
to
apple
chairman
mike
markkula
that
job
be
a
dreadful
manager
and
that
apple
should
see
that
he
get
management
training
before
be
allow
to
manage
other
company
project
that
involve
creative
work
when
job
get
a
copy
of
the
confidential
memo
raskin
be
fire
publicly
at
least
gate
have
only
nice
thing
to
say
about
job
when
the
macintosh
be
release
he
told
roll
stone
that
people
concentrate
on
find
job
flaw
but
there
s
no
way
this
group
could
have
do
any
of
this
stuff
without
job
privately
though
gate
have
a
different
opinion
accord
to
colleague
at
microsoft
they
say
gate
didn
t
have
respect
for
job
technical
ability
gate
look
with
disdain
on
steve

one
microsoft
manager
who
be
part
of
the
team
work
on
application
for
the
macintosh
i
think
he
thought
job
be
a
fake
that
he
be
all
bluster
and
no
go
i
don
t
think
he
thought
job
knew
how
to

anything
himself
like
steve

however
help
gate
deal
with
his
loneliness
accord
to

always
return

be
difficult
to
sustain
a
relationship
with
someone
who
could
boast
a
seven
hour
turnaround
meaning
that
from
the
time
he
left
microsoft
to
the
time
he
return
in
the
morning
be
a
mere
seven
hour
at
one
point
in
their
relationship
when

felt
particularly
overload
from
work
he
told
bennett
that
he

and
steve
ballmer
would
get
together
that
way
she

remain
more
focus
on
work
it
wasn
t
exactly
what
bennett
hop
to
hear
from
gate
he
be
and
be
very
hung
up
on
set
a
hardcore
work
example
in
his
company
bennett
say
i
think
this
be
unrealistic
and
inhuman
and
will
eventually
break
him
gate
remains
a
loyal
friend
say
bennett
i
know
he
be
there
and
would
do
anything
for
me
if
i
ask
him

could
not
have
be
too
heartbroken

wander
around
he
put
up
a

would
arrive
at
work
mid
morning
and
not
return

until
well
after
midnight
he
would
then
spend

a

either
at

as
microsoft

rely

more
and
more
to

and
he
encourage

with
him
the
same
way
he
try
to

most
people
like
electronic

say
ingrid
rasch
microsoft

human
resource
director
in
i
thought
it
be
the
best
thing
since
slice
bread
electronic
mail
be
the
hardest
thing
for
me
to
give
up
when
i
left
microsoft
in
everyone
be
connect
to
everyone
else
but
the
system
have
a
darker
big
brother
side
to
it
as
well
begin
in
microsoft
manager
secretly
begin
use
the
e
mail
system
to
determine
which
hourly
employee
be
work
on
weekend
accord
to
a
knowledgeable
management
source
at
microsoft
whenever
an
employee
log
into

it
left
a
trail
of
electronic

in
the
computer
memory
bank
this
information
be
retrieve
and
then
use
by
the
company
to
determine
employee
bonus
bonus
be
tie
not
to
how
effectively
one
work
how
much
be
accomplish
or
on
the
importance
of
a
specific
project
but
rather
on
how
many
hour
of
overtime
an
employee
put
in
late
at
night
or
on
the
weekend
in
time
word
get
out
that
big
brother
be

and
some
employee
begin
log
into
their
e
mail
on
weekend
with
a
modem
from
home
so
it
would
appear
they
have
come
in
but
microsoft
management
found
a
way
to
detect
this
too
accord
to
the
source
although
the
bonus
system
have
its
plus
it
also
provoke
hard
feeling
since
most
employee
work
strange
hour
and
no
one
punch
in
or
out
on
a
time
clock
it
be
difficult
for
management
to
know
how
much
overtime
a
person
work
many
employee
complain
the
system
be
not
equitable
e
mail
have
another
downside
an
information
explosion
employee
would
sometimes
have
to
spend
the
first
two
hour
of
their
day
answer
what
might
be
as
many
as
electronic
message
each
message
be
tag
in
military
time
so
it
be
clear
what
time
it
have
be
sent
and
many
of
the
message
be
sent
long
after
quit
time
it
be
a
big
macho
thing
to
send
e
mail
late
at
night
say
a
young
woman
who
be
hire
in
early
as
a
technical
writer
for
application
i
d
send
a
message
to
my
supervisor
and
look
at
my
watch
and
say
oh
yea
this
be
great
he
will
see
that
i
be
here
late
not
that
you
be
afraid
to
go
home
but
it
look
bad
actually
you
be
so
caught
up
in
the
work
that
you
didn
t
want
to
go
home
gate
himself
fire
off
e
mail
at
all
hour
of
the
night
and
early
morning
it
be
not
unusual
for
programmer
to
come
to
work
and
find
an
electronic
message
from
gate

and
keep

motivate
there
be
lot
of
problem
at
that
time
but
the
big
challenge
at
that
point
in
their
evolution
be
their
customer
service
area
it
be
a
total
disaster
they
didn
t
realize
how
important
it
be
until
somebody
get
in

and
start
make
them
aware

the
impact
it
have
on
their

week
on

ruttenbur
walk
into

return
call
to
customer
want
an
update
version
of
one
of
the

ruttenbur

shock
to
see
two
stack
of
hundred
of
unreturned
phone
message
on
each
of
their
desk
that
s
nothing
the
two
woman
told
him
point
to
another
table
fill
with
hundred
of
other
as
yet
unreturned
message
that
s
when
i
knew
that
i
have
a
major
challenge
on
my
hand
ruttenbur
say
ruttenbur
be
give
complete
authority
to
make
any
change
he
felt
be
necessary
customer
service
would
soon
grow
to
more
than
employee
while
the
technical
support
staff
triple
to
about
employee
ruttenbur
also
greatly
expand
the
company
s
retail
sale
force
only
major
change
involve
corporate
strategy
have
to
be
clear
by
shirley
shirley
watch
the
day
to
day
stuff
at
microsoft
he
be
good
at
that
a
good
detail
guy
ruttenbur
say
he
paid
attention
to
the
detail
so
that
bill
could
think
product
and
do
the
strategic
stuff
although
that
s
how
a
lot
of
people
described
bill
in
those
day
he
be
also
very
much
involve
in
everything
that
happen
in
that
company
bill
want
to
know
everything
that
be
go
on
he
didn
t
require
approval
he
just
want
to
know
what
you
be
do
and
he
want
you
to
explain
and
justify
it
by
his
second
or
third
product
management
meeting
ruttenbur
realize
that
it
be
vital
that
he
stand
up
and
speak
his
mind
if
he
felt
strongly
about
something
some
manager
seem
intimidate
by
gate
who
would
often
rock
back
and
forth
in
his
chair
star
off
into
space
as
if
he
be
not
pay
attention
then
suddenly
when
he
heard
something
he
didn
t
like
or
didn
t
agree
with
he
would
stop
rock
sit
up
straight
and
become
visibly
angry
sometimes
throw
his
pencil
he
often
yell
or
pound
his
fist
on
the
table
to
make
a
point
at
first
ruttenbur
thought
gate
be
just
put
on
an
act
it
be
hard
for
him
to
believe
a
ceo
could
react
so
emotionally
to
every
issue
but
he
soon
realize
this
be
no
show
gate
simply
react
to
thing
on
an
intense
emotional
level
he
would
get
upset
if
we
be
behind
the
competition
in
any
way
say
ruttenbur
and
that
meant
in
term
of
the
product
in
term
of
the
distribution
the
account
in
term
of
shelf
space
all
of
those
thing
it
be
make
very
clear
that
our
job
be
to
make
sure
we
be
number
one
but
i
learn
after
awhile
that
he
respect
people
who
disagreed
with
him
he
didn
t
expect
people
to
always
agree
with
him
and
i
think
sometimes
he
disagreed
just
to
see
if
someone
be
that
strong
in
their
belief
to
really
support
and
fight
for
their
opinion
with
the
right
people
it
really
work
well
but
with
some
people
it
suppresses
their
creativity
he
felt
that
if
gate
could
have
learn
to
use
his
intensity
and
anger
with
strong
employee
who
respond
well
to
that
kind
of
motivation
and
to
temper
it
with
people
who
become
intimidate
by
it
he
would
have
become
a
more
effective
manager
ruttenbur
be
part
of
the
group
that
come
up
with
the
name
for
the
odyssey
spreadsheet
project
excel
but
the
project
have
take
a
strange
turn
in
mid
gate
completely
change
his
strategy
and
decide
excel
would
be
developed
for
the
macintosh
rather
than
the
ibm
pc
and
its
clone
lotus
be
design
a
new
spreadsheet
call
jazz
for
apple
and
microsoft
simply
could
not
allow
lotus
to
establish
an
application
foothold
with
the
mac
as
it
have
with
the
pc
gate
desperately
want
microsoft
to
become
the
standard
bearer
for
graphical
user
interface
application
that
be
the
future
as
he
saw
it
jazz
be
clearly
a
new
threat
and
he
could
not
allow
it
to
catch
on
with
jazz
lotus
plan
to
offer
customer
much
more
than
just
a
spreadsheet
like
the
hot
new
trend
in
application
development
be
so
call
integrate
software
that
combine
several
different
application
into
one
easy
to
use
program
the
user
could
switch
say
from
a
spreadsheet
to
word
processing
without
have
to
load
another
application
jazz
would
combine
several
function
include
a
database
word
processing
and
graphic
as
well
as
a
spreadsheet
c
apple
be
enthusiastically
support
jazz
the
initial
excitement
over
the
macintosh
have
die
down
and
sale
be
sluggish
what
the
company
need
be
a
hit
application
that
would
make
people
line
up
to
buy
the
mac
just
as
they
have
bought
thousand
of
apple
ii
computer
because
they
want
visicalc
apple
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
then
they
really
thought
jazz
be
go
to
be
their
savior
say
ida
cole
who
in
be
director
of
new
product
development
at
apple
when
lotus
demonstrate
a
prototype
of
jazz
at
a
trade
show
gate
dispatch
two
of
his
programmer
to
check
it
out
the
two
furiously
scribble
note
as
mitch
kapor
talk
about
jazz
and
give
a
demonstration
some
jazz
feature
later
turn
up
in
excel
microsoft
be
experience
internal
squabble
over
the
excel
project
although
gate
have
decide
to
develop
excel
for
the
mac
after
talk
with
his
marketing
manager
he
have
never
discuss
the
change
in
strategy
with
doug
klunder
the
programmer
in
charge
of
cod
excel
for
the
pc
machine
because
the
cod
for
excel
up
to
that
point
have
be
do
for
the
pc
the
switch
meant
basically
start
over
after
month
of
hard
work
klunder
be
furious
and
threaten
to
quit
which
he
end
up
do
a
few
month
later
bill
just
screw
up
from
a
human
management
point
of
view
i
be
kill
myself
on
excel
klunder
would
later
say
gate
brought
in
a
new
programmer
from
wang
to
head
the
project
philip
florence
before
work
for
wang
florence
have
create
the
research
and
development
group
at
lead
edge
one
of
the
pc
clone
maker
it
be
a
pressure
cooker
florence
say
of
microsoft
i
be
work
directly
under
bill
and
he
take
a
special
interest
in
excel
florence
thought
he
be
be
brought
in
to
manage
the
project
but
before
long
gate
told
florence
to
write
code
and
check
for
bug
in
the
program
as
well
the
project
fell
far
and
far
behind
schedule
when
florence
told
gate
he
couldn
t
manage
the
project
and
write
code
at
the
same
time
gate
explode
slam
his
fist
down
on
the
table
to
get
his
point
across
and
carry
on
in
a
rage
say
one
of
the
manager
who
work
with
florence
imagine
an
extremely
smart
millionaire
genius
who
s
year
old
and
spoil
and
subject
to
temper
tantrum
it
be
clear
that
florence
be
not
cut
out
to
work
in
an
emotionally
charge
pressure
environment
like
microsoft
on
a
project
that
gate
himself
take
such
an
intense
interest
in
a
few
month
after
he
arrive
florence
who
have
be
put
in
hour
week
have
a
heart
attack
as
a
result
he
have
to
have
bypass
surgery
during
this
time
steve
job
have
be
try
to
convince
gate
to
incorporate
integrate
software
feature
in
excel
similar
to
those
in
jazz
but
gate
refuse
he
be
convince
lotus
be
take
the
wrong
approach
and
this
time
unlike
his
strategy
with
multiplan
gate
would
be
prove
right
because
microsoft
do
not
have
any
integrate
program
it
need
a
way
to
respond
directly
to
this
bonus
feature
of
the
jazz
software
gate
be
savvy
enough
to
realize
that
if
microsoft
could
develop
a
quick
way
of
switch
between
small
program
on
the
mac
it
would
be
more
effective
than
have
one
huge
integrate
program
like
jazz
thus
be
born
the
idea
behind
the
switcher
andy
hertzfeld
who
have
left
apple
to
strike
out
on
his
own
be
in
the
midst
of
design
his
own
switcher
when
he
get
a
call
from
a
friend
at
microsoft
his
friend
ask
him
to
come
in
and
talk
about
a
hot
new
project
that
microsoft
be
work
on
for
the
mac
it
be
hertzfeld
who
several
year
earlier
have
give
gate
the
first
demonstration
of
the
macintosh
prototype
at
apple
s
office
when
hertzfeld
sat
down
with
the
folk
at
microsoft
he
discover
the
company
want
him
to
write
a
switcher
program
very
much
like
the
one
he
have
start
a
couple
week
earlier
hertzfeld
be
convince
his
design
be
well
at
the
end
of
his
meeting
with
several
of
the
microsoft
manager
he
be
ushered
in
to
see
gate
for
a
one
on
one
meeting
hertzfeld
be
about
to
get
a
first
hand
demonstration
in
the
art
of
the
deal
from
the
young
master
himself
accord
to
hertzfeld
gate
treat
him
as
if
he
be
a
naive
technical
person
who
have
little
business
sense
whom
gate
try
to
manipulate
into
an
unfavorable
business
arrangement
the
negotiate
accord
to
hertzfeld
go
like
this
you
re
a
really
great
programmer
right
ask
gate
yeah
i
don
t
know
sure
i
guess
so
say
hertzfeld
caught
off
guard
and
unsure
where
gate
be
head
well
say
gate
a
really
great
programmer
should
be
able
to
write
this
program
pretty
quick
right
yeah
i
guess
so
i
don
t
know
sure
say
hertzfeld
so
how
long
do
you
think
it
should
take
you
ask
gate
gee
i
don
t
really
know
well
say
gate
if
you
be
really
good
and
you
be
really
good
right
then
it
shouldn
t
take
you
too
long
gate
strategy
soon
become
clear
to
hertzfeld
gate
be
attempt
to
appeal
to
hertzfeld
s
ego
his
vanity
to
get
him
to
vastly
underestimate
the
time
it
would
take
to
write
the
program
like
a
chess
master
gate
be
planning
his
negotiate
strategy
for
the
sale
price
several
move
ahead
they
finally
agree
that
hertzfeld
could
write
the
program
in
about
eight
week
gate
then
ask
hertzfeld
how
much
money
he
make
a
week
hertzfeld
told
him
about
well
say
gate
you
can
t
expect
to
make
more
than
that
right
so
eight
time
that
s
realize
his
program
be
strategically
important
to
apple
and
to
microsoft
hertzfeld
resist
gate
maneuvering
and
reject
his
offer
of
but
they
left
on
friendly
term
bill
say
even
if
i
didn
t
sell
it
to
microsoft
they
want
to
support
it
hertzfeld
turn
around
and
sell
the
switcher
program
to
apple
for
it
be
package
with
the
mac
for
free
and
also
be
sell
separately
the
switcher
enable
the
user
to
run
as
many
as
four
different
application
on
the
mac
at
the
same
time
keep
each
in
memory
while
move
between
them
with
the
flick
of
the
mouse
when
gate
receive
a
prototype
of
the
switcher
he
sent
hertzfeld
a
note
tell
him
how
great
he
thought
the
program
be
i
have
be

they
call

steve

really
pull
out
all

minute
to
shower
if
the
press
notice
however
no
one
write

perhaps
they
be
use
to
see
him
that
way
to

relief
the

go
off
without

about
million
on
a
marketing
campaign
for

microsoft
spent
less
than
million
to
promote
excel
yet
the
microsoft
program
blew
jazz
away
some
trade
publication
say
excel
on
the
mac
work
even
well
than
on
the
pc
the
mac
now
have
a
winner
of
an
application
program
and
apple
could
rest
easy
and
gate
once
again
have
set
the
standard
in
time
microsoft
would
become
the
top
seller
of
software
application
for
the
mac
lotus
as
it
turn
out
have
badly
miscalculate
with
jazz
and
its
integrate
software
strategy
jeff
raikes
director
of
microsoft
s
application
marketing
told
the
new
york
time
they
lotus
thought
all
mac
owner
be
yuppie
who
drive
bmws
they
say
let
s
boogie
with
jazz
but
we
give
the
market
a
product
that
prove
you
could
do
more
with
a
mac
than
with
an
ibm
pc
the
euphoria
over
excel
however
be
temper
by
microsoft
s
disappointment
with
window
after
many
delay
window
have
still
not
be
officially
release
at
the
time
of
the
excel
unveil
even
though
the
project
be
well
into
its
second
year
the
rag
appearance
of
gate
when
he
left
the
pierre
hotel
for
the
excel
announcement
would
not
have
surprised
most
people
who
work
closely
with
him
at
microsoft
although
he
be
about
to
celebrate
his
th
birthday
gate
have
not
change
much
from
his
hacker
day
in
the
computer
room
at
lakeside
when
he
would
forget
to
clip
his
fingernail
it
wasn
t
so
much
that
gate
didn
t
care
about
his
appearance
he
just
couldn
t
bring
himself
to
allocate
the
time
to
clean
up
on
a
regular
basis
there
always
seem
to
be
more
press
matter
that
need
his
attention
when
he
could
find
the
time
he
do
shave
shower
and
change
his
shirt
but
that
part
of
his
life
just
wasn
t
a
high
priority
when
you
saw
bill
it
always
make
you
wonder
where
do
he
sleep
last
night
in
his
office
say
one
young
woman
who
work
at
microsoft
from
through
you
always
want
to
go
up
and
ask
him
gee
bill
i
don
t
know
if
you
shower
every
day
but
if
you
do
you
should
also
wash
your
hair
of
course
no
one
would
ever
have
say
such
a
thing
to
gate
even
though
many
employee
probably
thought
it
he
be
legendary
around
microsoft
for
never
cleaning
his
glass
they
always
have
a
coat
of
oil
and
dirt
on
the
lens
when
gate
begin
appear
on
the
cover
of
national
magazine
begin
with
money
in
late
microsoft
s
public
relation
department
trust
his
secretary
to
make
sure
he
look
his
best
she
would
actually
go
out
to
his
house
and
pick
up
some
stuff
bring
him
a
clean
shirt
say
another
microsoft
employee
a
few
week
after
the
excel
announcement
the
wall
street
journal
call
microsoft
about
arrange
a
photo
shoot
with
gate
the
paper
be
run
a
series
of
promotional
ad

various
ceo
around
the

hold
up
a

with
the

line
next
to
the
wall
street
journal
nothing
keep
you
warmer
on
a
winter
night
it
be
good
publicity
for
the
paper
and
good
advertising
for
bauer
s
clothing
store
the
wall
street
journal
told
microsoft
it
would
like
a
shot
of
gate
hold
up
the
paper
with
the
tag
line
next
to
my
software
nothing
be
more
user
friendly
than
the
wall
street
journal
gate
reluctantly
agree
to
the
shoot
as
long
as
it
didn
t
take
more
than
one
hour
of
his
time
when
the
wall
street
journal
group
come
out
to
microsoft
they
brought
along
a
hair
stylist
microsoft
have
never
hire
a
hair
stylist
to
work
with
gate
when
national
magazine
want
picture
we
finally
figure
out
that
if
we
want
his
hair
wash
we
might
have
his
secretary
set
up
an
appointment
to
get
his
hair
cut
the
day
we
need
him
to
do
something
because
at
least
then
we
knew
it
would
be
wash
say
one
microsoft
manager
who
sometimes
handle
gate
the
wall
street
journal
people
figure
gate
would
be
thrill
to
have
his
picture
take
for
a
national
ad
campaign
in
fact
gate
hat
have
his
picture
take
he
thought
it
be
a
waste
of
time
and
he
be
just
sort
of
oblige
them
because
someone
have
say
it
would
be
good

find
someone
about
the

at
microsoft
who

involve
in
the

process
in
essence
both
be
hire
as
a
result
of
microsoft

attempt

win
a
lucrative
government
contract
to
provide
the
air
force
with

d
c
just
to
stay
on
top
of
government
contract
for
computer
related
product
gate
and
several
of
his
manager
would
discus
from
time
to
time
whether
to
hire
a
man
or
a
woman
for
a
particular
job
accord
to
the
source
they
would
say
well
let

hire
two
woman
because
we
can
pay
them
half
as
much
as
we
will
have
to
pay
a
man
and
we
can
give
them
all
this
other
crap
work
to
do
because
they
be
woman
that
s
directly
out
of
bill
s
mouth
i
thought
it
be
surprising
that
he
wasn
t
more
sensitive
to
the
issue
his
parent
be
pillar
of
the
community

and
the
other
officer
of
the
company
cole
wasn
t
sure
what
to
talk
to
the
microsoft
troop
about
have
only
be
with
microsoft
for
a
few
week
after

few
general
comment
she
outwardly

such
a
great
job
for
work
overtime
and
put
out
so
many
good

of
them

i
be
look
forward
to
a
great
career
at
microsoft
cole
say
it
be
very
personal
and
again
nobody
have
ever
gotten
personal
with
them
before
they
have
ballmer
up
there
be
the
cheerleader
but
it
be
so
impersonal
cole
left
the
stage
to
great
applause
some
of
the
more
experienced
technical
manager
listen
to
her
remark
be
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
all
praise
be
not
something
microsoft
employee
be
accustom
to
hearing
from
their
manager
it
be
very
weird
say
a
manager
on
the
window
development
team
it
be
this
very
mushy
person
to
person
i
m
go
to
make
it
a
well
place
very
non
technical
and
very
non
marketing
it
be
very
touchy
feely
and
of
course
here
be
all
these
guy
and
nobody
have
ever
encourage
them
to
take
an
interest
in
each
other
personally
and
here
s
ida
talk
about
personal
value
and
all
this
stuff
it
be
real
obvious
she
be
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole
we
have
no
idea
why
bill
would
have
chosen
this
person
not
long
after
the
company
meeting
cole
give
an
employee
two
week
of
paternity
leave
so
he
could
take
care
of
his
small
child
while
his
wife
recuperate
from
deliver
her
third
child
there
be
no
company
policy
on
paternity
leave

gate
told
cole
the
decision
be
unwise
by
september
of
cole

be
become
strain
cole

show
up
only
ten
minute
before
he
be
to
go
on
stage
and
appear
dishevel
in
his
rumple
suit
his
father
ran
the
slide
projector
for
the
presentation
have
promise
a
software
system
to
two
dozen
computer
manufacturer
as
well
as
hundred
of
application
publisher
gate
have
raise
enormous
expectation
but
within
microsoft
there
be
doubter
i
don
t
think
bill
understood
the
magnitude
of
do
a
project
such
as
window
macgregor
say
later
reflect
back
on
it
all
all
the
project
bill
have
ever
work
on
could
be
do
in
a
week
or
a
weekend
by
one
or
two
different
people
that
s
a
very
different
kind
of
project
than
one
which
take
multiple
people
more
than
a
year
to
do
there
be
some
odd
people
in
the
window
group
by
the
time
we
be
fully
staffed
which
for
microsoft
be
the
large
project
they
d
ever
do
the
technical
challenge
be
formidable
as
become
evident
later
to
operate
most
efficiently
the
program
require
more
memory
than
available
on
the
most
widely
use
ibm
compatible
computer
of
the
day
those
machine
base
on
intel
s
chip
have
only
k
of
memory
the
goal
for
window
be
to
create
a
system
that
could
accommodate
very
different
application
and
allow
them
to
run
at
the
same
time
with
just
the
click
of
a
mouse
but
most
application
program
write
at
the
time
be
incredibly
rude
accord
to
macgregor
when
they
d
start
up
they
d
grab
as
much
memory
as
they
could
lock
down
on
the
assumption
that
they
be
the
only
important
thing
run
so
typically
the
conversation
something
like
lotus
would
have
with
the
operating
system
when
it
start
up
would
be
how
much
memory
do
you
have
and
the
system
would
say
this
much
and
lotus
would
say
fine
i
ll
take
that
window
then
have
to
make
well
use
of
the
limited
memory
capacity
of
the
computer
available
on
the
commercial
market
one
of
the
major
challenge
be
write
code
contain
very
advanced
feature
that
could
run
fast
on
the
chip
and
be
crowd
into
so
little
available
memory
programmer
on
the
window
team
have
to
find
a
way
to
provide
the
application
only
some
of
the
memory
it
thought
it
need
to
run
at
precisely
the
time
it
need
it
during
the
first
several
month
of
the
project
there
be
little
to
suggest
such
an
undertaking
be
impossible
in
fact
nothing
seem
impossible
the
atmosphere
be
electric
it
be
exhilarate
excite
fun
we
be
compete
with
the
world
and
win
say
one
of
the
programmer
other
company
already
have
announce
windowing
product
but
we
be
able
to
persuade
the
oems
to
wait
for
ours
there
be
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
press
a
great
deal
of
excitement
around
window
that
first
year
or
so
be
really
excite
but
there
be
difficult
time
just
ahead
the
window
project
would
soon
reveal
some
serious
organizational
and
managerial
problem
within
the
company
fortune
magazine
in
an
article
on
microsoft
that
ran
at
the
end
of
january
make
what
would
turn
out
to
be
a
very
accurate
assessment
of
the
company
s
inexperienced
management
structure
a
lot
be
rid
on
window
if
it
fails
to
become
an
industry
standard
microsoft
may
not
get
another
chance
to
take
the
consumer
market
by
storm
momentum
be
an
ephemeral
quality
in
any
business
and
in
an
industry
evolve
as
fast
as
microcomputer
software
it
can
be
lose
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
like
other
fast
grow
company
race
to
seize
transient
opportunity
microsoft
have
devote
little
time
to
develop
the
kind
of
management
depth
that
will
be
need
to
turn
temporary
victory
into
long
term
dominance
the
arrival
of
macgregor
and
nikora
in
late
have
represent
an
attempt
to
bring
more
experienced
management
into
the
organization
microsoft
have
to
have
more
officer
and
sergeant
to
keep
the
soldier
march
in
semi
orderly
column
at
that
time
there
be
little
corporate
hierarchy
at
microsoft
individual
product
development
team
be
small
usually
no
more
than
three
people
simonyi
be
in
charge
of
application
development
macgregor
head
the
brand
new
interactive
system
group
with
a
staff
of
three
there
be
a
development
group
for
language
and
one
for
operating
system
each
group
have
its
own
guru
its
resident
genius
with
paul
allen
go
software
creation
be
very
much
under
the
direct
day
to
day
control
of
gate
i
don
t
think
of
bill
as
have
a
lot
of
formal
management
skill
not
in
those
day
say
macgregor
he
be
kind
of
weak
on
manage
people
so
there
be
a
certain
kind
of
person
who
would
do
well
in
the
environment
there
be
a
lot
of
people
at
that
time
with
no
people
skill
whatsoever
people
who
be
absolutely
incompetent
at
manage
people
it
be
the
peter
principle
very
successful
technical
people
would
get
promote
to
management
role
you
d
get
people
reporting
to
one
guy
who
be
not
on
speak
term
with
two
third
of
the
group
which
be
inconceivable
macgregor
try
to
interest
the
company
in
send
its
manager
to
a
short
but
intensive
management
training
program
offer
by
xerox
he
met
with
resistance
and
in
one
case
outright
hostility
from
gordon
letwin
who
be
in
charge
of
operating
system
letwin
have
be
the
last
of
the
original
programmer
hire
while
microsoft
be
still
in
albuquerque
the
microsoft
work
environment
for
programmer
be
deliberately
chaotic
and
letwin
like
it
that
way
the
feel
be
that
with
less
structure
you
could
be
more
creative
and
produce
innovative
product
a
rival
software
programmer
who
have
tour
the
company
in
found
little
formal
manage
go
on
at
all
at
least
in
software
development
they
have
a
model
where
they
just
totally
forgot
about
be
efficient
he
say
that
blew
our
mind
we
come
out
of
a
mainframe
world
and
there
we
be
at
microsoft
watch
all
of
these
software
tool
that
be
suppose
to
work
together
be
built
by
totally
independent
unit
and
nobody
be
talk
to
each
other
they
didn
t
use
any
of
each
other
s
code
and
they
didn
t
share
anything
but
over
the
year
that
s
turn
out
to
be
probably
in
the
pc
world
one
of
the
most
effective
model
with
his
experience
at
xerox
macgregor
seem
the
perfect
choice
to
guide
the
creative
process
one
year
young
than
gate
he
be
thoughtful
intellectual
and
selfcontained
the
two
of
them
spent
a
lot
of
time
together
in
the
first
week
of
often
sit
around
each
other
s
office
on
saturday
or
sunday
debate
the
proper
course
of
window
development
i
be
pretty
much
hand
off
the
ball
but
bill
and
i
would
meet
frequently
to
talk
about
the
design
and
various
need
macgregor
recall
i
ll
give
credit
to
bill
he
come
up
to
speed
pretty
fast
on
understand
the
issue
but
if
you
want
to
see
bill
you
never
try
to
reach
him
during
the
weekday
his
schedule
be
packed
if
you
really
want
to
have
a
longer
conversation
you
go
in
on
saturday
or
sunday
then
you
could
get
a
couple
hour
and
just
talk
about
something
they
do
a
lot
of
talk
how
should
memory
management
work
should
the
window
on
the
screen
be
overlap
like
on
the
macintosh
or
should
they
butt
up
against
each
other
like
tile
on
the
kitchen
sink
should
window
require
a
mouse
macgregor
understood
gate
pushy
pugnacious
way
of
make
a
point
and
he
respect
his
quick
sure
grasp
of
all
the
ramification
of
various
solution
to
a
give
problem
a
lot
of
people
don
t
like
their
job
because
they
don
t
get
any
feedback
macgregor
say
there
be
no
problem
there
you
would
know
exactly
what
bill
thought
about
what
you
be
do
the
goal
the
motivational
force
for
a
lot
of
programmer
be
to
get
bill
to
like
your
product
macgregor
also
like
the
fact
that
gate
do
not
let
his
ego
get
in
the
way
if
he
really
believe
in
something
he
would
have
this
intense
zeal
and
support
it
and
push
it
through
the
organization
and
talk
it
up
and
whenever
he
met
with
people
talk
about
how
great
it
be
macgregor
say
but
if
that
particular
thing
be
no
longer
great
he
d
walk
away
from
it
and
it
be
forgotten
a
lot
of
people
have
a
hard
time
do
that
it
make
him
incredibly
agile
in
a
business
sense
people
usually
fight
to
the
death
long
beyond
when
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
late
february
of
four
month
after
the
announcement
of
window
in
new
york
about
representative
from
various
software
publisher
and
computer
manufacturer
paid
each
to
attend
a
window
conference
sponsor
by
microsoft
most
of
the
company
that
have
publicly
pledge
their
support
be
represent
if
window
be
to
become
the
industry
standard
that
gate
sought
these
software
developer
would
have
to
write
application
for
it
so
it
be
essential
that
gate
be
able
to
keep
the
alliance
together
before
the
conference
the
word
out
of
the
microsoft
headquarters
be
that
window
would
be
available
by
the
end
of
march
but
those
who
attend
the
microsoft
conference
get
bad
news
microsoft
be
still
unable
to
provide
them
with
the
development
tool
to
write
those
application
the
window
deadline
have
be
push
back
to
at
least
may
inside
the
company
there
be
grow
problem
between
macgregor
s
interactive
system
group
and
the
operating
system
group
run
by
letwin
at
the
outset
of
window
development
it
be
the
operating
system
group
at
work
on
a
new
version
of
m
do
that
be
suppose
to
take
the
lead
write
some
of
the
most
advanced
code
which
would
be
deliver
to
the
interactive
system
group
and
adapt
for
window
but
as
the
month
drag
on
the
code
wasn
t
be
cranked
out
fast
enough
so
macgregor
have
his
team
do
some
of
the
cod
letwin
be
furious
for
the
skilled
and
ambitious
programmer
the
place
to
be
at

the

often
by

in

want
to
be
take
aboard
this
only
increase
letwin
s
resentment
the
bushy
beard
letwin
be
a
program

and
one
of
microsoft
s
old
hand
he
have
gain
his
position
as
head
of
the
operating
group
in
the
way
most
people
get
promote
at
microsoft
because
of
technical
prowess
and
not
because
of
his
management
skill
he
would
get
into
fight
with
programmer
who
work
under
him
and
would
go
for
day
or
week
give
them
the
silent
treatment
it
s
one
of
those
thing
that
happens
when
a
little
company

way
image
appear
on
the
screen
a
decision
base
on
feedback
from
test
of
the
still
evolve
program
but
it
be
become
obvious
that
the
problem
go
deeper
for
one
thing
gate
kept
change
his
mind
about
the
graphic
presentation
of
window
whether
individual
window
should
appear
tile
or
overlap
on
the
monitor
he
decide
to
add
feature
to
the
product
or
insist
on
other
midcourse
correction
and
although
he
hire
macgregor
and
nikora
to
oversee
the
project
gate
paid
no
heed
to
his
chain
of
com
mand
delegate
decision
make
on
such
an
important
project
be
anathema
to
him
and
he
intercede
in
every
decision
no
matter
how
small
he
be
down
there
micro
manage
everything
everyday
and
it
happen
all
the
time
say
one
former
member
of
the
interactive
system
group
people
would
be
go
along
and
we
would
find
out
behind
our
back
that
bill
have
totally
reverse
the
direction
we
be
go
and
never
even
bother
to
tell
us
it
be
more
than
a
minor
annoyance
whenever
a
change
be
make
or
a
glitch
uncovered
it
cost
the
company
time
change
make
by
gate
generally
improve
the
product
but
the
delay
be
have
a
cumulative
effect
that
be
hurt
morale
macgregor
would
argue
for
more
programmer
and
more
time
he
and
gate
have
loud
fierce
disagreement
about
how
long
the
project
be
take
there
be
shout
match
all
the
time
nikora
say
if
he
didn
t
like
the
way
scott
be
do
something
or
anybody
else
be
do
something
he
d
say
ok
i
ll
take
this
weekend
and
i
ll
code
it
and
i
ll
show
you
how
it
s
do
and
he
d
pound
his
fist
on
the
desk
when
macgregor
would
produce
the
late
development
schedule
he
include
extra
time
for
sickness
among
employee
fix
unexpected
bug
field
test
of
the
product
and
other
routine
contingency
gate
would
go
through
the
schedule
and
knock
out
all
of
the
contingency
time
say
he
didn
t
understand
why
it
be
necessary
i
think
bill
thought
i
be
blackmailing
him
macgregor
say
he
have
this
notion
that
gee
it
be
easy
to
make
change
he
have
typically
work
on
project
that
be
fairly
small
and
microsoft
then
do
almost
no
field
test
what
bill
didn
t
understand
be
that
when
you
have
large
and
complicate
project
with
a
lot
of
documentation
and
a
lot
of
people
the
trivial
change
take
a
long
time
you
have
to
factor
it
through
change
the
code
change
the
documentation
and
retest
it
make
sure
the
change
work
with
all
the
other
piece
of
the
program
if
you
make
a
change
once
every
three
month
you
d
never
ship
the
product
there
be
this
very
real
conflict
between
bill
s
desire
to
make
window
well
and
the
need
to
have
a
plan
to
execute
to
actually
get
the
product
out
one
of
the
most
costly
reversal
come
about
a
year
into
the
project
at
the
outset
window
have
be
design
to
operate
only
with
a
mouse
like
apple
s
macintosh
but
most
pc
user
be
only
familiar
with
type
command
on
a
keyboard
there
be
a
grow
sense
of
consumer
resistance
to
additional
hardware
also
microsoft
didn
t
want
to
jeopardize
its
chance
at
retain
lucrative
military
contract
as
macgregor
put
it
there
be
concern
about
try
to
use
a
mouse
while
drive
a
tank
despite
grow
pressure
from
digital
equipment
corporation
tandy
and
intel
to
deliver
window
gate
and
macgregor
reluctantly
decide
that
window
should
also
be
able
to
operate
with
a
keyboard
it
be
a
decision
that
cost
three
to
six
month
of
development
effort
it
be
frustrate
in
a
sense
because
shoot
if
we
have
know
that
in
the
begin
we
would
have
design
it
that
way
macgregor
say
so
why
do
he
go
along
with
gate
he
just
wore
me
down
as
the
deadline
slip
far
into
and
the
pressure
mount
to
get
a
product
out
there
be
constant
argument
in
gate
office
it
go
on
all
the
time
say
nikora
whose
office
be
next
to
that
of
gate
he
would
spot
the
fatal
flaw
in
his
opponent
s
argument
and
he
would
just
tear
into
the
person
some
like
macgregor
thought
the
obnoxious
streak
in
gate
be
his
way
of
test
his
own
idea
as
well
as
those
of
others
his
style
be
to
yell
a
lot
i
think
people
who
get
along
best
with
bill
be
those
who
can
yell
back
and
make
him
feel
they
might
be
right
macgregor
say
bill
doesn
t
surround
himself
with
yes
men
it
be
also
important
not
to
take
the
argument
personally
gate
doesn
t
rant
so
much
at
people
but
at
situation
it
s
not
like
he
s
try
to
vent
his
spleen
on
them
say
his
friend
vern
raburn
who
have
resign
under
pressure
in
as
president
of
the
company
s
consumer
product
division
because
of
his
competitiveness
he
get
so
upset
with
a
situation
it
s
like
a
stray
cruise
missile
anything
in
the
blast
range
get
in
trouble
macgregor
say
he
have
frequent
and
intense
argument
with
gate
bill
could
be
just
apoplectic
over
thing
that
be
just
the
emotional
level
he
react
to
thing
on
we
d
be
yell
at
each
other
but
at
the
end
of
the
argument
we
could
say
so
what
be
you
do
for
dinner
this
challenge
confrontational
style
be
inherently
part
of
gate
personality
his
father
described
it
as
hard
nose
conversation
engagement
gate
dismiss
it
as
high
bandwidth
communication
if
i
be
try
to
get
a
point
across
efficiently
and
i
be
with
people
i
work
with
for
a
long
time
or
we
be
talk
about
something
we
re
really
excite
about
then
if
an
outsider
listen
in
it
would
sound
awfully
hardcore
gate
say
to
characterize
it
as
just
aggressive
be
inaccurate
but
ruthann
quindlen
who
specializes
in
software
deal
for
investment
banker
alex
brown
and
have
know
gate
since
the
early
s
say
he
be
basically
insensitive
to
other
people
because
of
his
position
and
his
fame
people
be
willing
to
put
up
with
what
he
want
to
dish
out
she
say
but
he
can
t
distinguish
between
those
who
can
t
take
it
and
those
who
can
he
pay
no
attention
at
all
to
social
nicety
you
and
i
might
put
our
criticism
of
someone
in
guard
tone
he
can
t
do
that
in
any
fashion
on
the
window
project
this
confrontational
style
be
wear
down
nikora
so
be
the
long
hour
bill
require
everyone
to
devote
their
entire
life
to
microsoft
like
he
do
and
that
be
another
stick
point
between
myself
and
him
say
nikora
who
be
then
in
his
early
s
i
have
another
life
i
have
a
family
i
be
willing
to
put
in
hour
a
week
but
the
weekend
be
mine
for
my
family
i
be
right
on
the
edge
of
be
consider
someone
who
didn
t
put
in
enough
time
i
really
felt
he
be
step
on
my
toe
and
he
felt
i
be
insubordinate
gate
didn
t
want
to
hear
excuse
despite
their
management
responsibility
he
want
macgregor
and
nikora
to
really
pitch
in
it
be
at
that
point
that
he
decide
they
should
start
write
window
code
macgregor
be
incredulous
bill
he
argue
it
s
not
my
job
i
m
suppose
to
be
building
a
team
hire
people
divide
up
the
task
i
m
not
suppose
to
be
down
there
crank
code
nikora
didn
t
agree
either
but
he
dutifully
go
along
a
former
microsoft
manager
described
the
atmosphere
under
gate
in
as
management
by
crisis
everything
be
a
crisis
in
august
microsoft
and
gate
face
up
to
the
reality
that
at
least
part
of
that
haphazard
style
which
have
help
power
a
remarkable
if
sometimes
inefficient
software
incubator
for
nearly
ten
year
be
create
too
many
management
problem
the
crash
program
to
develop
window
have
stretch
into
nearly
a
year
and
still
there
be
no
marketable
product
in
sight
gate
under
the
firm
prod
of
jon
shirley
agree
to
take
himself
out
of
the
day
to
day
decision
make
he
be
try
to
oversee
five
product
line
and
key
planning
decision
be
often
delayed
or
be
never
make
at
all
it
be
a
strange
structure
gate
admit
in
an
interview
with
business
week
after
the
company
s
reorganization
we
could
never
focus
enough
on
the
different
part
of
the
business
after
microsoft
be
reorganize
into
separate
system
software
and
business
application
division
each
with
a
corporate
vice
president
gate
responsibility
become
somewhat
less
define
he
no
longer
have
anyone
reporting
directly
to
him
he
be
suppose
to
think
about
the
future
something
he
have
be
brilliant
at
all
along
he
also
have
more
time
to
become
a
more
visible
spokesperson
for
microsoft
but
there
be
another
reason
for
the
split
into
separate
division
not
disclose
to
the
press
there
be
complaint
from
software
developer
that
microsoft
have
a
competitive
advantage
because
its
application
group
get
inside
information
from
the
operating
system
group
include
the
group
develop
window
programmer
work
on
application
at
microsoft
to
run
under
window
for
example
knew
a
lot
more
about
window
than
outside
competitor
who
be
develop
application
to
work
with
window
with
this
inside
knowledge
microsoft
s
product
would
naturally
be
well
also
each
small
change
in
the
software
force
these
company
to
meet
with
microsoft
to
make
sure
the
change
would
also
work
with
m
do
this
give
microsoft
which
have
its
own
application
program
an
inside
look
at
a
competitor
s
best
product
it
be
an
advantage
enjoy
by
no
other
company
in
the
software
industry
gate
insist
that
microsoft
kept
the
play
field
level
by
erect
an
imaginary
barrier
between
the
company
s
operating
system
group
and
its
application
division
this
barrier
become
know
in
the
industry
as
the
chinese
wall
macgregor
say
that
at
the
time
of
the
reorganization
information
flow
freely
between
application
developer
and
window
developer
dan
lipkie
the
former
xerox
programmer
work
on
microsoft
word
before
transfer
to
window
and
neil
konzen
a
top
microsoft
software
engineer
switch
from
the
application
group
to
window
in
august
all
of
konzen
s
friend
be
in
the
application
group
and
they
d
talk
at
lunch
all
the
time
so
it
really
be
true
macgregor
say
the
application
developer
at
microsoft
have
well
knowledge
of
window
than
programmer
outside
the
company
two
month
after
the
august
reorganization
leo
nikora
found
himself
on
the
phone
to
the
press
explain
yet
another
delay
window
be
suppose
to
be
finish
in
october
but
after
a
year
of
development
microsoft
official
have
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
program
take
up
too
much
memory
and
be
too
slow
to
run
on
the
microchip
effectively
major
part
of
the
program
would
have
to
be
redesign
a
flashy
product
rollout
slat
for
the
fall
comdex
be
cancel
and
the
release
be
reschedule
for
spring
the
situation
be
frustrate
each
time
gate
told
his
window
marketing
crew
the
schedule
be
be
move
back
he
would
also
tell
them
that
this
time
the
release
date
would
be
met
and
each
time
nikora
found
himself
go
back
out
to
the
independent
software
vendor
to
tell
them
that
the
target
have
be
miss
again
i
just
felt
like
an
idiot
after
two
or
three
of
those
nikora
say
thing
weren
t
easy
for
gate
who
in
early
october
write
a
letter
to
one
impatient
software
publisher
explain
the
late
glitch
window
be
the
most
strategic
product
that
microsoft
be
work
on
gate
write
we
want
it
to
be
the
environment
of
choice
for
the
next
generation
of
graphical
application
to
achieve
this
goal
it
must
have
the
functionality
and
performance
require
by
this
new
generation
of
graphical
application
this
will
not
be
easy
it
will
be
a
significant
advancement
of
the
state
of
the
art
he
go
on
to
explain
how
he
felt
there
have
not
be
enough
progress
on
improve
the
product
s
performance
and
he
told
the
developer
that
window
would
be
delayed
until
april
the
press
he
say
would
be
told
that
window
would
be
available
in
june
this
be
an
attempt
by
gate
to

nau
seum
but
never
make
it
to

strategy
be
to
always
get
out
first
with
a
product
and
grab
a
share
of
the
market
and
fix
the
problem
later
with
window
he
inexplicably
take
just
the
opposite
approach
he
couldn
t
bring
himself
to
turn
it
lose
until
everything
be
perfect
most
of
the
reason
window
didn
t
get
out
be
because
bill
kept
add

and
change
the
rule
nikora

all
these

you

get

there
take
what
you
ve
get
and
get
it
out
there
you
can
always
make
it
well
you
can
always
improve
it
later
but
get
out
there
bill
s
feel
be
no
we
ve
get
to
go
out
there
with
something
that

just

everybody

it

from

the
numerous

little
encouragement
for

to

visicorp
be
go
broke
and
would
soon

go

it

suffer
disappoint
sale
digital
research
haid
a
graphical
user
interface
product
call
gem
due
for

soon
but
the
battle
as
the
industry
press
saw
it
be
go
to
be
between
window
and
topview
which
ibm
plan
to
market
in
early
in
the
opening
day
of
microsoft
be
force
into
a
key
strategic
marketing
shift
after
month
of
test
and
tinker
gate
have
to
admit
window
just
didn
t
work
fast
enough
or
well
enough
on
exist
hardware
that
end
plan
to
bundle
window
as
part
of
a
package
with
new
pc
make
by
compaq
tandy
and
the
rest
of
the
oems
who
have
originally
support
the
program
with
ibm
push
topview
instead
of
window
microsoft
have
only
one
move
left
if
it
want
the
program
to
become
a
standard
it
would
have
to
sell
window
separately
on
the
retail
market
and
hope
consumer
bought
it
in
sufficient
number
in
house
meanwhile
there
be
more
trouble
on
the
project
ballmer
be
not
get
along
with
nikora
he
would
storm
into
nikora
s
office
almost
daily
pound
his
fist
on
the
table
call
nikora
an
idiot
and
dismiss
his
idea
as
complete
joke
they
didn
t
like
what
i
be
do
in
marketing
nikora
say
they
didn
t
think
i
be
a
very
good
marketer
and
you
know
what
they
be
right
nikora
have
after
all
arrive
at
the
company
as
an
accomplish
programmer
and
manager
i
d
never
market
a
day
in
my
life
and
they
never
do
anything
to
teach
me
nikora
soon
quit
i
be
burn
out
he
say
i
also
left
because
microsoft
wasn
t
quite
ready
for
middle
management
they
thought
they
be
ready
but
they
weren
t
macgregor
be
also
have
his
problem
with
ballmer
the
former
equipment
manager
of
the
harvard
football
team
have
become
something
of
a
wild
man
he
be
a
gate
clone
but
without
gate
charm
or
technical
know
how
say
one
member
of
the
window
team
none
of
the
developer
admire
ballmer
because
bill
have
establish
this
ethos
that
development
manager
cod
then
he
appoints
steve
ballmer
who
have
never
write
a
line
of
code
in
his
life
gate
and
ballmer
have
very
different
style
ballmer
be
more
of
a
cheerleader
instead
of
work
with
the
program
team
through
macgregor
ballmer
be
always
intervene
personally
exhort
the
engineer
to
work
faster
he
would
get
the
software
engineer
psyched
to
really
go
all
out
and
push
the
outside
of
the
envelope
but
this
cause
monumental
problem
for
macgregor
by
their
nature
software
engineer
when
excite
about
a
project
would
always
underestimate
how
long
something
would
take
then
ballmer
would
get
in
meeting
with
the
engineer
look
at
their
development
schedule
and
give
em
hell
you
can
do
well
than
that
he
would
shout
while
beating
his
fist
on
the
table
these
guy
be
pretty
young
just
out
of
school
say
macgregor
and
they
d
try
to
take
some
time
off
their
schedule
which
be
already
unmakeable
this
be
incredibly
frustrate
for
me
because
you
d
get
a
quote
to
do
a
particular
function
in
four
week
and
i
knew
they
didn
t
have
a
prayer
of
do
it
in
less
than
six
and
here
ballmer
be
push
to
do
it
in
two
or
three
it
s
set
up
for
failure
he
knew
people
be
go
to
bust
their
butt
but
there
be
a
lot
of
stress
in
the
group
marriage
be
strain
my
philosophy
be
you
want
to
build
a
team
for
the
long
term
its
okay
to
sprint
you
need
to
sprint
to
get
product
out
the
door
but
you
can
t
sprint
all
the
time
ballmer
believe
that
schedule
be
something
to
be
negotiate
rather
than
an
attempt
to
accurately
project
how
much
time
something
would
take
it
meant
that
we
d
quote
date
to
software
publisher
write
window
application
that
be
totally
unrealistic
say
macgregor
but
there
be
few
and
few
customer
to
worry
about
accord
to
the
president
of
a
software
publishing
firm
that
support
window
the
repeat
delay
have
cause
a
crisis
of
confidence
in
the
industry
what
be
interest
be
everybody
from
lotus
to
ashton
tate
everybody
that
be
anybody
be
at
that
window
developer
conference
in
early
and
they
be
all
up
on
the
stage
say
yeah
we
re
go
to
do
window
and
window
be
great
blah
blah
blah
but
by
mid
they
d
all
drop
what
they
be
do
and
walk
off
part
of
it
be
they
just
get
disgust
with
microsoft
halfway
through
it
they
change
the
design
and
we
have
to
throw
away
what
we
d
do
and
start
over
one
of
the
big
disappointment
for
microsoft
be
that
lotus
decide
not
to
follow
through
on
a
pledge
to
support
window
mitch
kapor
knew
he
couldn
t
afford
to
have
microsoft
set
the
graphical
user
interface
standard
for
the
pc
allow
window
to
run
the
best
sell
spreadsheet
on
the
market
would
have
give
microsoft
too
much
leverage
if
mitch
have
put
the
seal
of
approval
on
window
it
would
have
be
a
big
deal
and
he
didn
t
want
to
do
that
say
one
of
microsoft
s
manager
both
gate
and
ballmer
do
a
lot
of
arm
twist
with
kapor
but
he
refuse
to
come
around
by
the
spring
of
macgregor
too
have
decide
to
leave
there
be
some
frustration
a
sense
of
want
to
do
some
other
thing
he
say
the
team
be
pretty
stress
out
it
have
be
a
long
haul
i
didn
t
agree
with
some
of
the
strategy
i
wasn
t
have
fun
i
think
its
very
important
if
you
have
the
luxury
of
choose
job
to
choose
one
that
s
fun
but
i
have
positive
feeling
toward
the
company
i
m
glad
to
have
work
there
glad
to
have
know
the
people
but
sometimes
you
just
want
to
do
other
thing
difference
with
ballmer
help
macgregor
make
up
his
mind
that
it
be
time
to
move
on
the
fact
that
steve
and
i
have
our
difference
be
probably
one
of
the
reason
i
didn
t
stay
i
think
his
style
of
directly
interact
with
the
programmer
and
beating
them
up
be
just
not
a
good
management
technique
he
probably
felt
i
be
drag
the
project
out
and
that
could
have
be
his
rationale
gate
do
his
best
to
persuade
macgregor
to
stay
on
in
the
week
before
macgregor
left
they
often
go
out
to
dinner
and
talk
about
the
company
gate
would
drive
over
to
his
apartment
in
his
brown
mercedes
the
back
seat
fill
with
empty
milk
carton
gate
drank
a
lot
of
milk
and
he
woulcl
toss
the
empty
carton
over
his
shoulder
and
continue
drive
the
car
smell
like
sour
milk
gate
take
it
personally
when
macgregor
finally
left
he
couldn
t
understand
why
the
relationship
couldn
t
be
repair
accord
to
macgregor
the
day
after
macgregor
left
ballmer
move
into
his
vacate
office
some
time
later
that
spring
with
another
deadline
approach
gate
call
ballmer
himself
into
his
office
on
a
rain
sodden
weekday
morning
the
night
before
gate
have
uncovered
a
bug
in
the
late
version
of
the
window
program
he
have
have
enough
fix
ballmer
with
a
cold
blue
stare
gate
begin
shout
at
him
if
window
be
not
on
the
shelf
by
the
end
of
the
year
gate
threaten
ballmer
would
be
look
for
another
job
the
ultimatum
galvanize
ballmer
he
gather
his
engineering
staff
together
to
pas
along
the
message
kid
ballmer

microsoft
have
a
similar
product
that
be
already
be
sell
with
the

apple
engineer
believe
their
basic
be
well
when
gate
heard
of
apple
s
plan
he
be
beside
himself
he
felt
betrayed
since
microsoft
have
thrown
so
much
of
its
resource
into
develop
application
for
the
macintosh
arguably
microsoft
save
the
mac
with
the
introduction
of
excel
gate
demand
that
sculley
cancel
the
project
and
sign
over
to
microsoft
right
to
the
macbasic
name
as
a
lever
gate
told
sculley
he
would
not
renegotiate
the
license
for
apple
to
use
microsoft
s
basic
on
the
best
sell
apple
ii
at
the
time
sale
for
the
macintosh
be
down
to
nothing
and
the
apple
ii
be
the
company
s
bread
and
butter
product
essentially
since
microsoft
start
their
company
with
basic
they
felt
proprietary
towards
it
say
andy
hertzfeld
the
apple
software
engineer
who
have
work
on
the
macintosh
project
they
felt
threaten
by
apple
s
basic
which
be
a
considerably
well
implementation
than
theirs
and
bill
gate
felt
compel
to
convince
apple
not
to
ship
the
one
donn
denman
have
developed
and
he
succeed
denman
have
be
work
on
macbasic
for
two
year
at
apple
when
sculley
suddenly
scuttle
the
project
it
broke
denman
s
heart
i
felt
like
my
two
year
old
child
have
be
take
from
me
he
recall
beside
himself
after
two
year
of
work
denman
climbed
on
his
motorcycle
and
go
race
wildly
through
the
foothill
above
cupertino
as
he
be
round
a
sharp
curve
he
lose
control
and
crashed
although
he
scrap
several
layer
of
skin
oflf
his
arm
and
leg
he
escape
serious
injury
i
felt
like
i
didn
t
have
too
much
to
live
for
at
that
point
he
say
denman
would
end
up
take
a
six
month
leave
from
apple
before
come
back
the
decision
to
cancel
macbasic
come
at
a
time
of
very
low
morale
around
apple
the
mac
be
not
do
particularly
well
the
industry
be
in
a
slump
employee
have
be
laid
oflf
and
steve
job
have
be
kick
out
of
the
company
but
cave
in
to
microsoft
hurt
the
most
everyone
be
somewhat
disgust
over
it
denman
say
i
know
the
issue
come
up
several
time
in
public
meeting
people
would
ask
john
sculley
whatever
happen
to
basic
i
m
work
away
on
this
project
and
how
do
i
know
it
s
not
go
to
get
cancel
like
basic
sculley
s
answer
be
we
do
some
horse
trading
there
it
be
the
right
decision
for
the
company
it
be
a
business
decision
ultimately
i
come
to
accept
that
point
of
view
i
want
to
create
something
for
people
to
use
and
it
didn
t
get
use
to
me
that
be
a
big
tragedy
but
it
be
an
ace
that
apple
trade
with
microsoft
for
something
and
i
m
not
in
a
position
to
evaluate
whether
that
be
a
good
deal
or
not
there
be
others
around

more
outspoken

hard
ball
tactic

atkinson
one
of
the

what

an
exceptional

our

would
soon
have
similar
thing
to
say
about
the
way

what
particularly
frighten

be
that

that
microsoft

reach
that
figure
by
or
it
now
make
a

for
microsoft

take

of
its

future
we
decide

those

the

need
to
be
one
that
specialized
in

choose
this

would

simpler
as
only
four
firm
with
the

of
expertise
microsoft
be
look
for
exist
choose
the

however
would
be
more
difficult
eventually
gau
dette
narrow
the
field
to
eight
firm
tell
each
of
them
they
would
have
half
a

to
him
in
the
end
gaudette
be

step
before

it
seem
ridiculous
that
a

would
have
that
kind
of
price
earnings
ratio
he
just
felt
uncomfortable
with
that
kind
of
prominence

with
the
expectation
that
would
be

in
the

of

way
he
felt
that
nishi
be
not
push
microsoft

product
such
as
multiplan
hard
enough
in
japan

be
instead
run
around
promote
his

random
high
tech
project
nishi
for
example
want
to
branch
out
into
semiconductor
gate
want
to
stay
with

nishi
thought
special

design
to
take
over
the
duty
of
the

gate
belittle
the
chip
development
effort
of
nishi
s
company
ascii
microsoft
s
operating
system
be
a
standard
he
say
and
what
nishi
propose
didn
t
make
sense
if
microcomputer
software
base
on
a
standard
be
not
a
good
thing
gate
told
the
los

time
then
hey
we
re
not
go
to
do
much
business
if
that
s
wrong
then
god
bless
kay
nishi
and
i
hope
he
find
a
raft
that
float
because
i
m
on
this
ship
tie
to
the
wheel
although
the
two
computer
whiz
kid
be
much
alike
nishi
have
a
wild
streak
that
gate
never
exhibit
especially
when
it
come
to
business
they
be
both
very
bright
intense
ambitious
and
driven
say
one
microsoft
executive
who
work
closely
with
the
two
but
kay
be
always
want
to
go
off
and
do
something
else
his
attention
span
be
not
very
long
he
always
want
to
start
something
new
and
he
always
tend
to
have
a
dozen
thing
go
at
the
same
time
of
which
six
be
just
great
and
the
other
six
be
just
random
who
knew
what
he
be
go
to
try
and
do
next
so
he
be
pretty
much
uncontrollable
nishi
have
become
something
of
a
japanese
folk
hero
he
be
feature
in
the
japanese
edition
of
playboy
magazine
and
he
be
spending
money
like
crazy
which
do
not
please
the
fiscally
conservative
gate
nishi
live
out
of
the
most
expensive
hotel
room
available
he
travel
to
appointment
by

on
one
occasion
when
he

nishi
wait
outside
the
executive
s
home
and
corner
him
when
he
arrive
this
kind
of
flamboyance
do
not
engender
the
trust
from
business
executive
that
be
so
important
in
japan
the
final
straw
for
gate

have
the
genial
informality
of
a

such
an
atmosphere

no

the
idea
be
to

that
sense
of
collegiality
say
ingrid
rasch
microsoft
s
director
of
human

in

never
be
away
from

wherever
they
go
to

we
be
move
them
halfway
across
the
country
how
do
you
make
them
comfortable
these

they
weren
t
go

quickly
or
participate
in
a
lot
of
the
thing
go
on
in
the
area
and
besides
we
need
them
at
work
so
we
want
to
keep
the
atmosphere
at
work
one
they
be
somewhat
familiar
with
and
secondly
also
make

of
social
belonging

at
all
that
he
have
no

how

that
there
might
actually
be
some
danger
leave
the

gate
and
winblad
would
assign
motif
to
their
brief
vacation
together
one
vacation
for
example
have
a
physic
theme
they
read
as
many
physic
book
as
they
could
and
listen
to
tape
of
the
feynman
lecture
series
gate
have
brought
with
him
winblad
could
not
believe
how
much
gate
read
the
breadth
of
his
knowledge
sometimes
overwhelmed
her
for
a
simple
lunch
at
burger
king
gate
once
brought
along
four
magazine
to
read
include
scientific
american
and
his
favorite
the
economist
nonetheless
there
be
significant
gap
in
what
gate
read
when
a
writer
from
the
hew
yorker
approach
him
for
an
interview
a
nonplus
gate
respond
what
s
the
new
yorker
the
always
competitive
gate
love
to
test
his
knowledge
against
others
especially
when
there
be
something
to
win
or
lose
the
bet
usually
escalate
into
double
or
nothing
with
a
few
side
bet
one
time
gate
bet
with
some
friend
about
which
year
the
mgm
hotel
in
la
vega
burn
down
to
verify
the
date
the
group
have
to
call
the
mgm
the
game
go
on
throughout
the
even
and
by
the
end
gate
have
lose
about
once
bill
have
be
bet
someone
and
it
kept
go
double
or
nothing
say
a
friend
of
winblad
s
bill
make
a
side
deal
that
work
out
to
his
advantage
and
someone
say
isn
t
that
typical
of
bill
double
or
nothing
just
won
t
do
for
him
but
that
s
why
bill
be
bill
winblad
who
be
fluent
in
gate
speak
once
described
gate
as
massively

the

a

the

could
also
be
very
entertain
accord
to
winblad
gate
be
a
fabulous
story
teller
often
resort
to
theatrics
to
make
a
point
or
tell
a
story
over
dinner
if
he
have
a
story
to
tell
it
doesn
t
matter
if
there
be
four
people
in
the
restaurant
or
a
thousand
she
say
bill
will
jump
up
from
the
table
stand
somewhere
and
start
act
out
the
story
it
s
no
longer
let
me
recount
to
you
what
happen
it
s
now
hamletl
it
becomes
more
theater
than

tell
year
ago
when
no
one
knew
who
bill
be
he
would
do
this
kind
of
stuff
and
who
would
care
but
now
he
s
totally
totally
unconscious
that
half
the
people
in
that
restaurant
be
probably
mumble
to
the
other
person
be
that

over
there
jumping
up
and
down
and
wave
his

this
include
thing
like
jumping
up
in
the

even
jumping
over
the
furniture
in
a
restaurant
to
prove
a
point
accord
to
friend
gate

at
one
point
winblad
reportedly

sooner
before

i
use
to
sit
there
in

to
myself
why
s
this
guy
gate
in
trial
here
waste
his
time
everyday
his
time
be
so
much
more
valuable
if
he
could
buy
brock
out
for
a
half
million
it
would
be
money
well
spent
i
wasn
t
sure
if
he
be
just
try
to
squash
brock
on
the
principal
of
the
thing
or
what
these
guy
microsoft
play
hardball
they
grind
people
it
almost
doesn
t
make
good
business
sense
but
after
the
trial
it
make
good
business
sense
to
corr
to
go
out
and
buy
some
of
microsoft

stock
which
have
nearly
triple
in
value
since
the

go
public
nine
month
earlier
i
thought
they

very
hard

businessmen
very
tough
and
they
now
have
a
lock
on
the

of

contact
the

the

begin
in
with
a

the

after
the
brilliant
success
of

marketing
disaster
the
most
notable
of
which
be
the

with
a

that
one

piece
of

chew

unfortunately
for

the

stuck

on

two

and
two
day
after
the

in

ibm
introduce

a

built
around

don

counting
on
the

at
to
make
up
for
the
disappointment
of
the
pc
junior
ibm
need
a
hit
and
even
though
the
price
for
the
pc
at
start
at
about
estridge
be
convince
the
new
computer
would
attract
customer
who
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
more
powerful
chip
the
pc
at
have
be
developed
with
typical
ibm
secrecy
under
the
code
name
salmon
this
time
ibm
even
get
microsoft
to
install
chicken
wire
in
the
ceiling
of
the

where
about
a
dozen
prototype
of
the

kept
microsoft

busily
perfect
the
third

run
on
the

jokingly
call
the
room
the
fish
tank
gate
do
not
share
ibm
s
enthusiasm
for
the
chip
he
described
the
chip
as
brain
dead
he
want
ibm
to
wait
and
build
its
next
computer
around
an
even
more
advanced
chip
that
intel
be
work
on
the
the
decision
by
ibm
to
go
ahead
with
a
personal
computer
strategy
base
on
the
chip
would
prove
to
be
a
major
blunder
estridge
ignore
what
bill
be
tell
him
about
the
and
decide
to
introduce
the
machine
and
that
be
the
key
decision
that
create
all
the
problem
say
stewart
alsop
editor
and
publisher
of
pc
letter
and
a
respect
authority
on
gate
and
microsoft
estridge
knew
gate
be
right
about
the
chip
but
estridge
be
under
pressure
from
high
ups
at
ibm
to
market
a
successful
pc
after
the
failure
of
the
pc
junior
accord
to
alsop
estridge
figure
the
machine
could
keep
the
corporate
dog
in
armonk
off
his
heel
until
intel
s
chip
be
ready
probably
by
although
the
pc
at
be
introduce
with
do
gate
realize
the
operating
system
be
be
push
to
the
limit
something
new
be
need
a
replacement
for
do
in
gate
sign
a
long
term
joint
development
agreement
with
ibm
to
create
a
new
operating
system
from
scratch
know
at
the
time
as
advanced
do
eventually
it
take
the
name
o
ibm
saw
the
new
operating
system
as
part
of
a
grand
strategy
to
link
computer
of
all
kind
big
and
small
ibm
want
an
operating
system
that
would
allow
it
to
connect
personal
computer
to
its
mainframe
but
the
project
soon
ran
into
major
technical
problem
because
of
the
flaw
chip
which
make
it
difficult
for
the
chip
to
handle
old
software
write
for
m
do
machine
under
the
new
operating
system
gate
do
not
want
to
continue
waste
time
and
money
try
to
develop
the
new
operating
system
for
the
chip
unfortunately
the
one
person
at
ibm
whom
gate
might
have
be
able
to
convince
estridge
be
kill
on
a
stormy
august
even
in
in
the
crash
of
delta
air
line
flight
at
the
dallas
forth
worth
airport
though
they
often
disagreed
gate
and
estridge
have
gotten
along
famously
probably
because
estridge
would
argue
with
gate
they
have
respect
and
trust
each
other
now
gate
have
to
deal
with
bill
lowe
who
take
over
the
entry
level
division
at
boca
raton
although
lowe
have
convince
the
corporate
brass
at
ibm
to
approve
project
chess
in
he
do
not
have
estridge
s
technical
competence
gate
and
lowe
profess
mutual
respect
but
they
have
an
arm
s
length
relationship
you
now
have
a
guy
in
charge
who
know
nothing
about
computer
alsop
say
of
lowe
gate
try
to
make
his
case
regard
the
chip
but
lowe
would
not
listen
the
new
operating
system
he
say
have
to
work
on
the
chip
that
chip
represent
the
future
ibm
have
invest
too
much
in
the
pc
at
and
it
could
not
abandon
those
customer
in
early
during
a
retreat
for
microsoft
s
application
development
team
gate
rant
at
what
he
call
ibm
s
fuck
up
strategy
accord
to
one
of
the
programmer
who
be
there
bill
say
screw
the
people
with
the
at
let
s
just
make
it
the
new
operating
system
for
the
so
they
can
upgrade
it
be
left
to
compaq
to
do
what
ibm
refuse
to
do
in
september
of
compaq
introduce
a
pc
with
intel
s
chip
the
other
clone
computer
maker
have
be
wait
for
ibm
to
make
the
move
to
the
after
all
it
be
ibm
that
have
always
set
the
standard
when
compaq
jumped
in
and
take
the
lead
its
gamble
paid
off
handsomely
the
compaq
deskpro
be
the
most
powerful
personal
computer
on
the
market
by
the
time
the
fall
comdex
roll
around
that
year
some
of
those
other
clone
computer
maker
be
show
off
machine
compatible
with
compaq
but
not
ibm
accord
to
alsop
at
the
time
compaq
introduce
its
new
computer
ibm
have
not
order
a
single
chip
from
intel
ibm
apparently
have
decide
the
chip
be
well
suit
from
minicomputer
but
once
the
compaq
deskpro
be
out
ibm
realize
it
have
seriously
miscalculate
and
not
only
by
ignore
the
apple
s
macintosh
with
its
user
friendly
graphic
be
finally
start
to
do
well
and
ibm
do
not
have
a
graphical
user
interface
in
the
work
to
go
with
the
new
operating
system
it
be
develop
with
microsoft
lowe
finally
realize
ibm
have
to
have
a
graphic
system
for
o
as
gate
have
be
tell
him
all
along
thus
the
stage
be
set
for
a
fateful
meeting
between
gate
and
lowe
in
armonk
new
york
gate
would
later
tell
alsop
that
when
he
met
with
lowe
he
figure
he
have
no
chance
of
get
ibm
to
go
along
with
develop
window
for
o
gate
walk
in
there
think
he
have
lose
the
account
when
in
fact
he
could
have
gotten
anything
he
want
alsop
say
he
have
be
work
so
long
and
so
hard
to
get
ibm
to
buy
into
window
and
the
and
he
hadn
t
gotten
anywhere
so
he
go
in
and
right
off
the
bat
offer
to
do
whatever
lowe
want
well
bill
lowe
be
a
smart
guy
take
advantage
of
it
at
that
point
lowe
drove
a
stake
into
the
ground
and
say
here
be
the
thing
we
be
go
to
stand
on
lowe
told
gate
ibm
want
o
to
run
on
the
chip
but
he
insist
it
first
work
on
the
he
also
agree
to
license
window
for
the
new
operating
system
but
insist
the
name
be
change
to
presentation
manager
more
importantly
he
convince
gate
to
revise
the
graphical
user
interface
and
incorporate
concept
of
a
graphic
system
use
in
ibm
mainframe
machine
what
this
meant
however
be
that
microsoft
s
window
for
do
would
not
be
compatible
with
window
for
o
gate
have
want
window
to
run
with
both
system
why
would
gate
the
ultimate
tough
nose
negotiator
roll
over
so
easily
in
deal
with
lowe
gate
be
uncharacteristically
deferential
toward
ibm
executive
accord
to
several
microsoft
manager
whenever
he
talk
with
someone
from
ibm
it
be
as
if
his
mother
be
in
the
room
with
him
gate
be
on
his
best
behavior
bill
sort
of
have
two
mode
say
scott
macgregor
the
window
development
manager
gate
hire
away
from
xerox
parc
for
all
the
other
oems
he
would
be
very
confident
and
very
self
assure
and
feel
very
comfortable
tell
them
what
the
right
thing
to
do
be
but
when
he
work
with
ibm
he
be
always
much
more
reserve
and
quiet
and
humble
it
be
really
funny
because
this
be
the
only
company
he
would
be
that
way
with
in
meeting
with
ibm
this
change
in
bill
be
amaze
macgregor
say
he
left
microsoft
partly
because
he
thought
the
company
be
make
some
strategic
mistake
in
the
joint
development
work
with
ibm
on
o
ibm
want
to
merge
presentation
manager
and
o
and
there
be
those
of
us
on
the
window
team
who
didn
t
feel
like
it
be
the
right
direction
macgregor
say
eventually
window
begin
to
take
a
back
seat
within
the
company
in
the
push
to
develop
presentation
manager
at
one
point
after
the
meeting
between
gate
and
lowe
in
steve
ballmer
want
to
kill
window
entirely
argue
that
microsoft
be
splitting
its
resource
by
stick
with
window
ballmer
be
just
be
a
good
soldier
he
have
be
responsible
for
maintain
good
relation
with
ibm
almost
from
the
day
jack
sam
first
call
on
microsoft
from
boca
raton
in
the
summer
of
i
know
from
conversation
with
people
at
microsoft
in
environment
where
they
didn
t
have
to
bullshit
me
that
they
almost
kill
window
say
alsop
it
come
down
to
ballmer
and
gate
have
it
out
ballmer
want
to
kill
window
gate
prevent
him
from
do
it
gate
view
it
as
a
defensive
strategy
just
look
at
gate
every
time
he
do
something
he
try
to
cover
his
bet
he
try
to
have
more
than
one
thing
go
at
once
he
didn
t
want
to
commit
everything
to
o
just
on
the
off
chance
it
didn
t
work
and
in
hindsight
he
be
right
ballmer
because
it
be
his
job
to
keep
the
ibm
account
want

as
the
infoworld
story
would
describe

ask
the
three
if
they
would
like
to

some
more
back
at

so
much
about
himself
that

keep
steer
the
conversation
back
to
industry

insight
on
the

from
the
industry
s
lead
spokesperson
although
gate
thoroughly
enjoy
himself
he
would
come
to
regret
that
his
candor
that
night
be
later
use
by
his
bitter
enemy
lotus
chairman
jim
manzi

sometimes
meant
work
weekend
the
combination
of

every

be
what
gate
refer
to
as

the
conversation
back
to
himself
gate
also
described
the
new
home
he
be
building
a

by
then
he
felt
computer
themselves
would
be
write
well
software
than
people
the
day
after
their
even
rap
session
with
gate
gilbert
and
his
companion
from
lotus
met
at
a
beach
and
decide
to
write
up
as
much
as
they
could
remember
of
the
meeting
it
have
be
incredibly
excite
say
gilbert
explain
why
he
want
to
record
gate
thought
in
addition
gate
have
say
some
thing
that
gilbert
felt
be
important
information
to
be
share
with
others
at
lotus
gate
for
example
have
ask
gilbert
why
lotus
never
sent
any
of
its
technical
people
out
to
microsoft
to
hear
about
thing
the
company
be
do
gilbert
thought
senior
technical
people
at
lotus
should
know
gate
have
essentially
extend
them
an
invitation
one
of
the
three
who
have
be
present
that
even
mary
fenstermaker
didn
t
agree
with
the
decision
to
write
the
memo
and
refuse
to
put
her
name
to
it
i
didn
t
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
she
say
my
impression
be
that
bill
gate
have
no
idea
nor
do
he
expect
a
memo
to
result
from
our
chat
nonetheless
gilbert
go
ahead
send
the
memo
to
four
people
at
lotus
one
of
them
bruce
johnston
sent
it
on
to
lotus
chairman
jim
manzi
title
it
note
from
a
gate
date
the
follow
report
be
blunt
unedited
and
liable
to
piss
you
off
johnston
write
of
the
gilbert
memo
it
be
manzi
who
told
his
secretary
to
send
a
copy
to
jim
cannavino
at
ibm
accord
to
a
well
place
source
at
lotus
manzi
have
have
a
long
unhappy
history
with
gate
they
have
not
spoken
in
three
year
as
of
nor
have
they
spoken
since
although
they
occasionally
trade
verbal
jab
through
the
medium
a
former
journalist
who
rise
through
marketing
to
become
the
head
of
lotus
manzi
take
over
as
chairman
in
when
mitch
kapor
left
to
pursue
other

at
the
time
gate
and
kapor
be
negotiate
a
merger
with
a
split
manzi
block
the
deal
and
he
and
gate
have
avoid
each
other
ever
since
the
fact
that
the
merger
didn
t
go
through
be
probably
just
as
well
for
microsoft
which
overtook
lotus
in
as
the
world
s
number
one
software
company
on
august
of
that
year
when

the

for
the

to
fuel
the
fire
smolder
between
microsoft
and
ibm
george
gilbert
come
to
regret
his
decision
to
write
it
it
be
my
misfortune
and
bad
judgment
to
put
myself
in
a
situation
where
something
i
do
could
be
use
against
bill

he

exactly
one
week
after

it
be
double
talk
cannavino
told
reporter
ibm
would
take
over
much
of
the
o
development
while
microsoft
be
free
to
push
window
the
new
york
time
liken
the
announcement
to
an
earthquake
that
rattle
window
and
break
china
but
leaf
the
roof
intact
as
a
result
of
their
decision
microsoft
quickly
shift
about
of
its
programmer
who
have
be
work
on
o
over
to
window
the
announcement
that
the
two
company

go
to
follow
separate
path
left

more
confuse
than
ever
about
which
direction
the

head
who

go
to
set
the
standard

there
even
be
a
standard

in
a
much
quote
remark
executive
at

microsoft

to
insist
there
be
nothing
fundamentally
wrong
in
the
relationship
they
be
still
partner
cannavino
say
few
in
the

believe
it
the
general
feel
be
that
microsoft
not
ibm
be
now
rid
the
crest
of
the
personal
compute
wave
there
be
certainly
a
lot
more

in

at
the

two

one
of

how

the

she

and
microsoft
have
an
i
win
mentality
they

the
ibm

they

not
take
the

that
everyone
can
win
with
them
with
so
much
bill
bashing
go
on
in
the

few
believe
the
ftc
investigation
be
as
narrowly
focus
as
microsoft
claimed
in
the
week
after
the
announcement
more
and
more
of
microsoft
s
competitor
empty
their
spleen
to
the
national
press
some
of
the
bile
be
obviously
start
to
get
to
gate
in
an
interview
with
usa
today
gate
fire
back
at
those
who
claimed
the
ftc
probe
be
much
broader
than
microsoft
have
acknowledge
there
s
no
truth
to
what
they
critic
be
say
gate
say
and
whenever
someone
asks
me
about
this
thing
i
say
just
get
somebody
who
be
willing
to
put
their
name
in
print
with
these
lie
because
they
be
just
direct
lie
you
can
slander
people
behind
the
scene
a
lot
but
this
time
somebody
might
be
caught
red
hand
because
this
be
just
out
and
out
baloney
gate
be
ask
if
he
felt
persecute
by
all
the
anti
microsoft
sentiment
no
i
ve
developed
a
new
view
that
be
successful
be
not
a
fun
thing
sometimes
there
be
just
a
phenomenon
where
people
don
t
like
a
company
as
successful
as
ours
although
the
price
of
microsoft
s
stock
be
be
hammer
by
the
constant
stream
of
negative
publicity
gate
profess
not
to
be
concerned
he
say
microsoft
s
stock
be
probably
too
high
in
the
first
place
and
need
to
come
down
to
a
more
realistic
figure
let
s
say
the
stock
drop
in
half
or
a
third
big

i
don
t
have
a
short

issue
ask
any
wall
street
analyst
which
company
never
over
promise
what
s
go
to
happen
always
talk
up
the
risk
in
their
business
and
take
the
long
term
approach
it
s
microsoft
besides
i
have
an
infinite
amount

microsoft
go
down

we
d
like

they
examine
it

make
a
totally
frivolous
offer
and
then
announce
that
they
be
produce
their
own
cook
however
told
the
ftc

microsoft
be
naturally
try

but
we
knew
that
we
weren

even
at

very
begin
of
our

even
before
they
told
us
they
might
enter
the

it
be
kind
of
obvious
they
be
a
big

they
be
not

some

t

come
out
with

later
over

be
go
to
be
a
viable
product
and
we
also
felt
that
this
be
just
phase
one
of
a
grander
marketing
plan
gate
have
personally
join
the
fray
he
be
pitch
the
product
to
some
of
the
large
company
in
the
nation
bearing
free
software
he
would
meet
with
in
house
computer
technician
try
to
convince
them
to
abandon
novell
and
netware
for
microsoft
and
lan
manager
bill
would
take
the
time
to
talk
to
them
directly
and
say
gee
can
i
answer
any
question
as
to
why
you
should
be
develop
for
the
o
platform
say
the
ex
novell
executive
we
also
heard
a
number
of
instance
where
microsoft
and
ibm
would
go
into
the
large
corporation
go
right
up
to
the
manager
of
information
system
level
and
say
this
be
the
future
lan
manager
be
where
the
future
be
go
to
be
and
novell
be
part
of
the
past
novell
marketer
counter
with
their
roundhouse
punch
when
they
begin
sell
a
new
generation
of
netware
they
expect
microsoft
sale
personnel
would
be
out
disparage
it
microsoft
they
felt
be
nearly
certain
to
attack
it
for
system
reliability
because
the
new
operating
system
be
programmed
in
a
way
that
make
it
faster
than
lan
manager
but
accord
to
conventional
wisdom
less
protect
against
major
system
failure
in
an
attempt
to
counter
that
attack
novell
engineer
thoroughly
test
lan
manager
try
to
find
a
way
to
make
the
program
blow
up
from
a
remote
work
station
it
didn
t
take
very
long
say
the
ex
novell
executive
i
m
sure
it
be
less
than
a
week
not
only
could
we
blow
up
the
server
we
could
virtually
put
it
into
never
never
land
where
you
have
to
reboot
and
reinstall
the
whole
operating
system
again
once
we
found
that
we
package
that
up
and
go
on
a
road
show
and
actually
go
to
the
industry
analyst
and
we
say
you
may
hear
some
issue
relative
to
reliability
what
we
d
like
to
demonstrate
to
you
be
that
no
system
be
protect
no
matter
what
you
do
and
we
would
set
up
the
lan
manager
and
commence
to
blow
it
up
we
d
do
it
right
in
their
office
we
heard
from
the
rumor
mill
that
microsoft
do
in
fact
go
back
in
to
the
analyst
three
or
four
week
afterward
and
they
do
begin
to
open
up
the
issue
of
reliability
the
analyst
from
what
we
understood
say
oh
yeah
watch
this
and
they
blew
up
lan
manager
they
say
don
t
talk
to
us
about
system
reliability
we
d
always
heard
gate
be
emotionally
attach
to
lan
manager
we
always
thought
we
could
turn
the
tide
against
them
because
we
didn
t
have
a
rational
businessman
compete
against
us
we
have
a
guy
who
be
emotionally
attach
to
a
product
that
couldn
t
compete
microsoft
have
a
tough
sell
on
its
hand
with
lan
manager
for
other
reason
o
introduce
in
december
be
not
move
well
as
note
earlier
they
make
o
and
lan
manager
appear
to
be
inseparable
say
an
industry
expert
that
be
a
mistake
they
forgot
the
most
important
common
denominator
and
that
be
all
of
the
do
user
the
do
user
be
a
second
cousin
in
this
lan
manager
environment
it
be
expensive
to
migrate
from
do
to
o
and
they
felt
they
be
be
abandon
com
meanwhile
have
become
by
far
the
large
seller
of
lan
manager
sell
more
than
seventy
percent
of
the
copy
but
the
company
be
get
kill
because
of
the
licensing
agreement
it
have
sign
to
seal
the
deal
with
microsoft
com
gamble
that
lan
manager
sale
would
soar
agree
to
pay
microsoft
a
minimum
monthly
royalty
payment
no
matter
how
many
of
the
product
be
sell
when
the
market
didn
t
develop
com
found
itself
pay
microsoft
for
thousand
of
unsold
copy
lan
manager
have
be
license
to
numerous
company
to
sell
with
the
various
company
jockeying
for
position
customer
be
confuse
frustrate
with
the
slow
sale
microsoft
take
a
drastic
step
it
decide
to
sell
lan
manager
directly
and
do
so
through
com
s
own
well
developed
network
dealer
channel
that
meant
microsoft
be
now
compete
with
its
own
partner
metcalfe
felt
the
move
be
nothing
less
than
a
double
cross
although
the
contract
didn
t
specifically
prevent
such
a
move
the
response
that
i
get
say
metcalfe
be
you
ought
to
negotiate
your
contract
more
carefully
you
be
stupid
we
be
adult
kessler
say
we
be
big
boy
and
girl
when
we
sign
the
contract
there
may
be
some
provocative
thing
you
can
say
about
microsoft
but
it
s
also
appropriate
to
say
that
this
be
a
legal
binding
document
and
we
sign
it
we
sign
it
on
the
belief
that
certain
thing
be
go
to
happen
to
the
o
market
they
do
not
happen
and
it
be
not
incumbent
on
microsoft
to
give
us
relief
if
i
be
them
i
would
have
but
i
m
not
them
they
chose
to
enforce
the
letter
of
the
agreement
in
late
com
manage
to
negotiate
its
way
out
from
under
the
crush
minimum
royalty
agreement
and
terminate
the
relationship
nonetheless
in
its
fiscal
quarter
end
in
february
com
take
loss
top
million
mostly
due
to
the
microsoft
partnership
and
a
reorganization
spark
by
the
ill
fat
deal
metcalfe
believe
com
have
be
victimize
by
the
fall
out
between
microsoft
and
ibm
as
o
falter
and
window
sale
grow
and
by
the
rapaciousness
of
microsoft
s
cadre
of
young
zealous
deal
maker
the
arrogance
of
microsoft
in
this
partnership
be
unbearable
it
drove
our
people
crazy
metcalfe
say
it
s
just
bad
business
when
your
customer
and
your
partner
emerge
damage
from
deal
with
you
microsoft
be
a
billion
dollar
company
grow
fifty
percent
a
year
that
creates
a
lot
of
pressure
on
people
especially
young
inexperienced
people
to
perform
and
deliver
and
sometimes
those
pressure
set
aside
the
nicety
despite
the
disagreement
metcalfe
still
like
gate
i
think
the
world
of
him
what
s
happen
be
a
bit
out
of
his
control
he
s
create
a
monster
in
january
microsoft
set
out
to
capture
another
segment
of
the
network
market
with
ashton
tate
the
top
database
software
publisher
and
sybase
a
california
minicomputer
software
publisher
ashton
tate
and
microsoft
plan
to
share
development
responsibility
create
an
o
version
of
sql
server
a
program
that
manages
network
database
for
ashtontate
the
partnership
represent
a
chance
to
co
opt
microsoft
which
have
not
yet
come
up
with
a
database
program
to
challenge
ashton
tate
s
lead
product
dbase
it
also
represent
an
offhand
endorsement
of

since
the

s
anticipate
upgrade
dbase
iv
be
to
be
use
in
sql
server
the
deal
take
an
inordinately
long
time
to
work
out
the
negotiator
deadlocked
frequently
which
require
ed
esber
head
of
ashton
tate
and
jon
shirley
to
intercede
and
get
talk
move
again
esber
recall
later
that
it
be
a
complicate
agreement
in
a
complex
relationship
it
s
very
hard
to
capture
the
essence
in
a
contract
on
a
piece
of
paper
esber
say
you
have
to
approach
it
in
two
style
the
way
i
approach
it
be
we
ll
have
a
partnership
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
partnership
we
ll
resolve
issue
the
way
microsoft
approach
it
be
we
will
get
on
paper
every
loophole
we
can
get
and
the
legal
document
be
the
relationship
that
be
the
difference
he
say
i
view
the
relationship
as
something
between
two
people
that
as
in
any
relationship
would
require
the
two
party
to
work
together
to
resolve
issue
that
weren
t
anticipate
i
think
they
view
the
relationship
as
the
contract
the
exact
legal
language
in
the
contract
and
nothing
more
a
few
hour
before
the
january
announcement
of
the
deal
with
ashton
tate
and
sybase
gate
place
a
call
to
his
chief
competitor
in
the
language
arena
philippe
kahn
of
borland
there
have
be
rumor
that
microsoft
be
go
to
buy
ashtontate
in
fact
the
firm
have
talk
about
merge
previously
gate
evidently
not
want
to
upset
his
borland
rival
allayed
kahn
s
fear
of
the
microsoft
ashton
tate
alignment
we
re
make
a
deal
with
ashton
tate
but
you
don
t
have
to
worry
gate
told
kahn
bill
will
only
do
thing
that
give
him
an
advantage
but
this
be
one
of
the
rare
time
he
be
boasting
about
it
say
kahn
of
the
phone
call
from
gate
it
become
a
joke
for
him
to
see
ashton
tate
give
away
the
store
that
way
on
that
note
the
partnership
formally
begin
it

not
an
auspicious
begin
it
end
on
an
equally
bad
note
ashtontate
thought
microsoft
have
promise
to
deliver
a
server
that
would
work
with
netware
so
the
product
would
reach
the
large
possible
customer
base
gate
naturally
enough
want
his
own
lan

rather
than

that

well
with

novell
would
need

its
product
to

microsoft
have
broken
the
spirit
of
the
agreement
fear
sql

would
flop
if
it
be
captive
to
the
relatively
puny
lan

market
esber

novell
the

a
joint
marketing
and
sale
agreement
for

esber
ran
into

at
a
software
conference
who
have
gotten
wind
of
the
novell
deal
in
a
crowd
hallway
he
tore
into
esber
call
his
deal
with
novell
stupid
rant
that
it
couldn

ashton

with

sue
in
deference
to
microsoft
esber
call
off
the
novell
deal
at
the
last
minute
but
the
rift
between
the
company
could
not
be
mend
microsoft
have
an
escape
clause
in
the
contract
that
allow
it
to
break
the

if
dbase

party
walk
into
the

from
the

side
esber
say
both
side
fail
to
meet
the
expectation
of
the

there
certainly
be
one
party
try
harder

the

microsoft
have
become
notorious
in
the
industry
not
just
for
capitalize
on
the
technological
advance
of
others
but
as
some
claim
for
predatory
pilfer
they
complain
that
microsoft
repeatedly
approach
small

develop

ostensibly
to
talk
about
a

good
enough
that

of

lacency
will
lead

few
year

you

make
many
time
since

who
control
the

many
feel
control
the
direction
of
the

at
the
moment
that
be
gate
microsoft
have
force
a
generation
of
software
developer
to
write
application
that
conform
to
its
standard
wordperfect
may
have
decide
it
be
time
for
someone
to
shoot
the
fox
when
microsoft
announce
in
april
of
that
the
ftc
investigation
of
the
company
have
be
expand
the
san
jose
mercury
news
quote
several
industry
source
as
say
the
folk
at
wordperfect
played
a
lead
role
in
lodge
complaint
against
microsoft
official
of
the
utah
base
company
acknowledge
they
have
talk
to
the
ftc
as
have
a
lot
of
others
in
the
industry
at
the
heart
of
the
ftc
probe
be
not
microsoft
s
aggressive
style
or
the
way
it
do
business
but
whether
or
not
microsoft
s
dominant
position
have
chill
competition
and
thus
hurt
consumer
prove
that
microsoft
have
engage
in
anticompetitive
practice
would
be
very
difficult
and
could
take
year
of
litigation
accord
to
many
legal
expert
the
federal
government
have
a
much
strong
case
against
ibm
and
be
unable
to
beat
the
computer
giant
after
a
bruising
and
costly
ten
year
court
fight
the
ftc
would
have
to
walk
a
fine
legal
line
in
try
to
make
a
case
against
microsoft
antitrust
law
be
intend
to
keep
company
from
engage
in
conduct
that
generally
tends
to
hurt
competition
but
it
s
difficult
to
determine
the
difference
between
aggressive
business
practice
and
anticompetitive
behavior
have
microsoft
abuse
its
position
or
just
out
hustle
and
outfoxed
others
in
the
industry
the
computer
business
be
so
complex
that
some
legal
expert
don
t
believe
the
ftc
even
understands
the
issue
well
enough
to
contemplate
a
suit
much
less
win
one
it
s
also
consider
unlikely
the
government
could
mount
much
of
an
attack
against
microsoft
since
the
company
do
have
competition
in
operating
system
at
t
have
a
small
part
of
the
market
and
two
year
ago
digital
research
long
since
have
give
up
on
cp
m
come
out
with
an
operating
system
call
dr
do
although
dr
do
have
not
yet
gain
a
real
industry
foothold
it
be
cut
into
microsoft
s
market
for
do
more
to
the
point
apple
computer
have
its
own
operating
system
for
the
macintosh
the
only
application
area
where
microsoft
clearly
dominates
be
in
application
for
the
mac
and
that
s
because
gate
take
a
risk
in
that
apple
s
new
computer
then
only
a
prototype
would
survive
in
a
very
competitive
industry
the
mac
might
well
have
fail
have
it
not
be
for
microsoft
application
like
excel
in
microsoft
control
about
a
quarter
of
the
application
market
although
application
product
account
for
fifty
one
percent
of
microsoft
s
revenue
in
the
bulk
of
the
company
s
profit
come
from
the
system
side
microsoft
do
not
come
close
to
dominate
the
big
three
of
application
word
processing
database
and
spreadsheet
wordperfect
be
far
ahead
of
microsoft
word
lotus
be
still
ahead
of
excel
and
microsoft
have
nothing
to
compete
against
ashtontate
s
dbase
the
reason
so
many
company
have
complain
about
microsoft
however
be
that
they
feel
it
cross
the
line
in
the
separation
of
church
and
state
competitor
like
wordperfect
and
lotus
as
well
as
many
others
suspect
microsoft
give
sneak
preview
of
change
in
its
operating
system
to
its
application
people
so
they
can
be
out
the
door
first
with
product
microsoft
s
application
programmer
they
fear
get
information
on
a
new
feature
in
do
or
window
far
in
advance
of
outside
application
developer
still
even
if
this
occurs
there
be
probably
nothing
illegal
about
microsoft
s
application
group
benefiting
from
knowledge
of
the
company
s
system
development
accord
to
legal
expert
familiar
with
antitrust
law
and
microsoft
do
invite
its
competitor
to
redmond
to
be
briefed
on
any
change
in
its
operation
system
the
company
even
hire
an
ombudsperson
to
keep
watch
over
the
system
and
operation
people
to
appease
outsider
in
theory
microsoft
keep
the
play
field
level
by
segregate
the
operating
system
division
and
the
application
division
information
be
not
suppose
to
flow
freely
between
them
this
imaginary
partition
be
call
the
chinese
wall
a
term
borrow
from
the
security
industry
to
describe
the
separation
between
investment
banker
who
have
inside
knowledge
of
stock
sale
and
stock
broker
who
could
profit
from
that
information
still
microsoft
s
competitor
complain
that
the
company
s
chinese
wall
be
full
of
hole
and
microsoft
add
fuel
to
the
fire
when
it
shift
worker
between
application
and
system
one
senior
application
programmer
at
microsoft
who
have
be
with
the
company
since
the
early
s
say
the
chinese
wall
be
a
creation
of
the
medium
not
microsoft
it
doesn
t
exist
he
say
i
remember
bill
gate
say
many
time
there
be
no
chinese
wall
somebody
get
this
idea
there
be
this
wall
between
system
and
application
so
we
wouldn
t
talk
to
each
other
there
s
no
such
thing
we
don
t
have
any
separation
here
just
one
big
company
we
don
t
have
any
limit
to
our
corporation
across
those
boundary
we
never
id
and
there
s
no
reason
to
that
doesn
t
make
sense
this
be
the
real
world
isn
t
it
if
somebody
want
to
write
application
for
our
operating
system
they
re
go
to
take
what
they
can
get
right
stewart
alsop
for
one
and
there
be
others
who
agree
with
him
say
the
fundamental
advantage
microsoft
have
be
not
the
operating
system
but
bill
gate
he
never
allows
microsoft
to
goof
off
he
always
deal
with
the
problem
every
other
company
allows
something
else
to
get
in
the
way
but
gate
be
tenacious
that
s
what
s
scary
he
note
that
the
first
version
of
microsoft
word
and
window
be
market
failure
because
they
didn
t
work
well
but
gate
kept
come
back
until
he
get
it
right
bill
always
come
back
like
chinese
water
torture
alsop
say
people
be
scar
of
microsoft
because
they
be
so
persistent
they
have
execute
well
than
any
other
company
others
don
t
feel
they
be
capable
of
compete
with
microsoft
it
s
a
lack
of
self
confidence
every
other
company
have
screw
up
do
microsoft
have
an
unfair
advantage
that
result
in
inferior
product
in
the
industry
that
s
the
myth
that
s
what
all
the
competitor
want
you
to
believe
microsoft
have
make
it
harder
to
compete
because
it
s
constantly
address
problem
it
single
handedly
force
lotus
to
improve
its
product
lotus
be
not
do
a
good
job
of
upgrade
its
product
but
because
of
excel
lotus
clearly
felt
a
competitive
threat
that
s
the
irony
the
reason
microsoft
have
such
a
hold
on
the
industry
a
monopoly
be
that
they
make
well
product
nonetheless
many
in
the
industry
would
like
to
see
the
monopoly
they
claim
microsoft
have
broken
up
by
splitting
microsoft
s
operating
and
application
division
into
separate
company
one
example
of
such
a
separation
occur
at
apple
in
apple
computer
spun
off
its
application
software
group
into
an
independent
company
know
as
claris
corporation
after
the
ftc
broaden
its
investigation
of
microsoft
there
be
rumor
the
company
might
do
just
that
divide
and
not
wait
to
see
what
come
of
the
investigation
in
fact
the
company
chose
just
the
opposite
tactic
when
microsoft
reorganize
in
early
and
mike
maple
be
place
in
charge
of
both
system
and
application
maple
have
previously
be
vice
president
of
application
and
steve
ballmer
vice
president
of
system
the
move
be
hardly
one
that
microsoft
would
have
take
if
it
be
run
scar
of
the
ftc
microsoft
refuse
to
back
off
in
the
face
of
the
ftc
probe
even
as
government
investigator
carry
out
box
of
document
from
microsoft
among
other
thing
the
ftc
order
microsoft
s
legal
department
to
notify
all
employee
they
be
not
to
kill
any
e
mail
date
back
prior
to
mid
if
microsoft
be
worried
about
complaint
it
be
monopolize
the
industry
it
didn
t
show
it
at
an
application
briefing
for
reporter
well
after
the
announcement
of
the
ftc
investigation
maple
say
if
someone
think
we
re
not
after
lotus
and
after
wordperfect
and
after
borland
they
re
confuse
my
job
be
to
get
a
fair
share
of
the
software
application
market
and
to
me
that
s
percent
although
gate
profess
not
to
be
concerned
about
what
the
ftc
might
find
a
microsoft
manager
close
to
gate
say
gate
be
hurt
by
the
viciousness
of
the
attack
against
microsoft
in
the
wake
of
the
probe
the
ftc
investigation
be
a
lighten
rod
to
bring
computer
people
forward
and
say
that
it
would
be
helpful
if
microsoft
be
hobble
in
some
way
gate
told
newsweek
in
june
of
the
newsweek
article
end
with
an
apt
passage
from
john
steinbeck
s
novel
cannery
row
the
thing
we
admire
in
men
kindness
and
generosity
openness
honesty
understand
and
feel
be
the
concomitant
of
failure
in
our

and
those
trait
we
detest
sharpness
greed
acquisitiveness
meanness
egotism
and
self
interest
be
the
trait
of
success
and
while
men
admire
the
quality
of
the
first
they
love
the
produce
of
the
second
the
same
apparently
be
true
about
gate
shortly
after
the
unveil
of

in
the

nightmare
scenario

the
year
ahead
be
leak
to
the
press
a
very
different
portrait
of
the
megalomaniac
gate
that
some
in
the
industry
picture
emerge
the
memo
reveal
a
gate
motivate
by
fear
rather
than
arrogance
the
reaction
on
wall
street
may
have
make
his
memo
the
most
costly
in
corporate
history
in
the
six
page
memo
gate

his
bad
fear
for

come
true

candidly
talk
about
all
of
the
problem
face
microsoft
from
difference
with
ibm
to
the
ftc
investigation
and
the
apple
lawsuit
the
apple
lawsuit
clearly
represent
the
big
threat
to
microsoft
at
least
in
gate
mind
microsoft
be
spending
million
to
defend
feature
contain
in
every
popular
window
system
on
the
market
and
to
help
set
the
boundary
of
where
copyright
should
and
should
not
be
apply
he
write
i
think
it
be
absurd
that
the
lawsuit
be
take
so
long
our
view
that
we
almost
certainly
will
prevail
remains
unchanged
but
gate
also
go
on
to
say
that
if
the
judge
hearing
the
apple
case
rule
against
microsoft
it
could
be
disastrous
apple
be
seek
more
than
billion
in
damage
from
microsoft
the
real
concern
however
be
not
the
money
but
have
to
make
fundamental
change
in
the
product
which
could
set
microsoft
back
several
year
not
surprisingly
ibm
receive
a
fair
amount
of
attention
in
the
memo
as
well
gate
ask
his
executive
to
refrain
from
publicly
criticize
their
former
partner
we
will
not
attack
ibm
as
a
company
and
even
our
public
attack
on
o
will
be
very
professional
gate
say
eventually
we
will
need
to
have
a
neutral
relationship
with
ibm
for
the
next
month
it
may
be
fairly
cold
we
can
emerge
as
a
well
and
strong
company
and
people
won
t
say
we
be
the
standard
because
ibm
chose
us
gate
bluntly
say
that
the
breakup
with
ibm
meant
microsoft
would
no
longer
have
to
accept
ibm
s
poor
code
poor
design
and
other
overhead

reason

want

not

sculley
would

the

way
to
do
that
be
to
work
with
another

ibm
may
have
have
a
hidden
motive

insider
believe
that
if
apple
won
its
landmark
copyright
suit
against
microsoft
and
hewlett
packard
it
would
then
go
after
ibm
for
presentation
manager
since
it
be
very
similar
to
window
but
apple
would
be
less
inclined
to
go
after
ibm
if
it
be
a
partner
publicly
at

not

there
s
no
way
anybody
can
feel

he

out
at
o
clock
in
the

i
almost
step
on
gate
on
top
of
a
woman
out
on
the
lawn
bill
like
to
have
woman
in
his
life
say
a
microsoft
executive
who
have
know
gate
for
ten
year
for
the
last
few
year
gate
have
have
an
on
again
off
again
romance
with
a
product
manager
in
microsoft
s
marketing
division
neither
will
comment
about
the
relationship
because
he
come
from
a
close
knit
family
with
traditional
value
close
friend
expect
gate
eventually
to
marry
and
have
child
his
family
be
an
important
part
of
him
say
paul
allen
i
don
t
want
to
put
word
in
his
mouth
but
i
expect
him
to
have
a
family
one
day
gate
himself
have
say
he
expect
to
be
married
before
and
he
expect
to
have
child
eventually
but
gate
have
also
make
some
rather
unfatherly
remark
over
the
year
after
a
personal
computer
forum
in
tucson
arizona
two
year
ago
gate
be
have
a

with
the
curt
pronouncement

a
subset
as
much
as
bill
want
child
he
may
never
be
able
to
take
that
step
say
his
friend
vern
raburn

a
conversation

say
raburn
he

part

t
find
in
most
people
that
s
why
he
doesn
t

priority
with
him
i
m
sure
he
never
thought

be
a
consideration
for
people

a
triumvirate
would
now
share
the

he
say
microsoft
have
become
so
large
that
no
one
person
could
handle
the
duty
of
the
number
two
job
rather
than
go
outside
the

chose
three
close

and
microsoft
executive
steve
ballmer
mike
maple
and

gaudette
as
the
ruling
troika
to

although
analyst
be
surprised
by
the
move
it
show
that
gate
be
still
very
much
in
control
and
that
s
what
investor
like
to
hear
microsoft
s
stock
surge
nearly
a
share
the
day
the
shakeup
be
announce
it
s
impossible
to
imagine
a
microsoft
without
gate
at
the
control
those
who
know
him
best
say
he
be
as
driven
as
ever
and
as
long
as
he
s
in
charge
microsoft
will
not
be
threaten
as
the
world
s
lead
software
company
we
have
this
vision
of
where
we
be
try
to
go
and
we
re
a
long
way
away
from
it
gate
say
during
a
recent
interview
in
his
modest
office
a
large
picture
window
look
out
over
part
of
microsoft
s
huge
campus
but
bill
gate
be
not
the
kind
of
ceo
who
spends
valuable
time
admire
the
view
you
gotta
watch
out
for
the
anticlimax
he
go
on
in
response
to
a
question
about
what
it
felt
like
to
be
the
chairman
of
the
world
s
large
software
company
i
mean
we
be
not
on
top
of
the
networking
heap
or
the
spreadsheet
heap
or
the
word
processing
heap
computer
be
not
very
easy
to
use
we
don
t
have
information
at
our
fingertip
there
be
one
thing
that
be
fun
i
look
out
there
and
see
fun
people
to
work
with
who
be
learn
a
lot
that
s
cool
and
that
feel
good
but
we
re
not
on
top
yes
our
revenue
be
big
than
anybody
else
s
but
if
we
don
t
run
fast
and
do
good
thing
his
voice
trail
off
leave
the
sentence
unfinished
gate
get
up
and
walk
over
to
his
desk
to
return
to
work
believe
me
he
say
as
the
interview
end
star
out
the
window
and
say
isn
t
this
great
be
not
the
solution
to
push
thing
forward
you
ve
get
to
keep
drive
hard
