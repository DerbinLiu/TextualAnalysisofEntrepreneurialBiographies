indeed
byerly
s

be
get
well
the
turn
point
come
in
a
counterintuitive
breakthrough
when
the
researcher
try
invert
his
builder
surfactant
ratio
all
prior
experience
with
soap
have
show
that
reduce
the
amount
of
builder
in
a
formula
make
it
milder
on
clothing
like
everyone
else
therefore
byerly
have
assume
he
want
to
keep
the
proportion
of
surfactant
the
actual
cleaning
agent
as
high
as
possible
he
thought
he
need
to
minimize
the
amount
of
builder
which
after
all
be
what
be
react
with
water
hardness
to
create
the
stiffness
and
gray
that
plague
early
formulation
when
byerly
try
boost
the
builder
level
well
above
the
surfactant
level
though
a
surprising
thing
happen
the
detergent
continued
to
clean
effectively
while
the
calcify
residue
the
gray
deposit
that
stiffen
wash

left
them
harsh
diminish
substantially
why
it
work
no

could

it
work
by

it

under

circumstance
we
felt
the
most

action
we
could
take
be
to
withdraw
our
laundry

from

its
side

the

hop
that
once
consumer
notice
the
inferior
performance
of
nonphosphate
detergent
they
would
agitate
to
repeal
the

but
consumer
saw
little
difference
and
a
grassroots
campaign
to
allow
the
sell
of

never

eventually
company

three
possible
approach
to

of

one
be
to

that

the
growth
of
bacteria
that
produce
the
enzyme
responsible
for
decay
cause
acid
another
be
to
try
to
eliminate
the
enzyme
the
final
option
be
to
concentrate
on
make
the
tooth
enamel
more
resistant
to
acid
attack
whichever
approach
be
take
top
management
knew
that
the
outlay
in
time
and
money
would
be
huge
eventually
it
be
agree
that
strengthen

the

the

that
evidence
of
the
value
of

be
even
less
convincing
therefore
the

believe
that

prematurely
concerned
thac
the

the

the

there
be
the

the

emerge
some
test

react
with
severe
eye
irritation
bc
have
run
into
what
research
supervisor
jim
monton
would
later
characterize
as
a
dire
need
for
a
radical
fix
fortunately
for
p
g
bolich
have
discover
just
such
a
fix
while
work
on
an
unrelated
project
the
magic
ingredient
bolich
s
team
have
be
investigate
rinse
off
conditioner
try
to
develop
formulation
that
would
counter
their
tendency
to
make
hair
get
dirtier
more
rapidly
the
fatty
tail
of
many
conditioner
molecule
the
team
found
interact
with
sebum
the
hair
s
natural
oil
cause
a
large
greasy
complex
that
would
not
rinse
off
the
hair
bolich
s
effort
to
isolate
conditioning
molecule
with
fatty
tail
that
would
not
interact
with
sebum
come
up
empty
then
the
research
team
take
a
different
tack
bolich
s
hobby
of
refurbish
old
automobile
have
familiarize
him
with
the
lubricate
property
of
a
range
of
oil
in
particular
silicone
oil
because
it
be
uncharged
and
have
no
long
fatty
chain
volatile
silicone
oil
he
found
evaporate
off
the
hair
within
a
few
hour
of
wash
make
it
unlikely
to
complex
with
sebum
or
other
conditioning
ingredient
it
do
not
deposit
easily
on
hair
however
require
formulation
with
high
oil
concentration
the
team
try
mix
the
silicone
oil
with
other
oil
that
deposit
more
effectively
these
effort
yield
a
product
that
perform
well
but
still
left
hair
rather
oily
then
come
a
breakthrough
from
out
of
the
blue
or
at
any
rate
our
of
what
bolich
call

think
while
oil
a
camp
trip
he
ran
out
of

and
use

to

his

rinse
easily
out

his

while
the
bacon
fat
remain
coat
and
slick
io
the
pan
why
lie
wonder
the
answer
lay
evidently
in
the
difference
in
their
viscosity
cooking
oil
be
thin
and
fluid

turn
to
the

problem
he
be
work
on
back
in
the

what
would
happen
if
he
could
somehow
thicken
the

cone
oil
if
it

reason
when

it

it

return
to

bolich
begin

with

he

silicone

high
in

nonvolatile
prove

we
have
all
kind
of
problem
break
that
thick
goo
up
into
small
panicle
bolich
remember
eventually
he
found
a
blend
of
gum
and
liquid
silicone
oil
thin
enough
to
disperse
while
still
stay
viscous
enough
to
stay
on
the

the
formulation
work
well
on

switch
in

and
then
when
lesting
move
to
human
subject
something
unexpected
happen
test
subject
report
that
the
conditioner
left
lhcir
hair
feel
soft

silky
that
caught
the
researcher
attention
we
hadn
t
see
that
in
the

we
be
not
look
for
it
bolich
recall
so
we
increase
the
level
and
wc
try
it
on
some
people
that
have
sortie
really
unruly
hair
and
hair
problem
they
say
gee
this
doc
so
me
tile
that
no
conditioner
have
ever
do
it
not
only
provide
the
comb
and
detangling
benefit
expect
from

but
also
provide
new
dry
hair
benefit
such
as
smoothness
softness
and
shine
and
all
without
the
dirty
oily
feel
that
traditional

create
bolich
combination
of
perseverance
nonlinear
experimentation

the
good
sense

uncovered
something

the

confirm
that

indeed
be
change
with
that
find
establish

go
on
to
the
next
problem
how
can
the
gel
be
apply
to
teeth
and
remain
there
long
enough
to
do
its
work
the
initial
approach
we

let

of

spent
a
couple
of

prototyping

could
use
at

sagel
soon
notice
dial
the
amount
of
bleaching
gel
need
to
accomplish
the
job
be
actually
very
small
the
only
thing
that
really
matter
be
surface
concentration
of
peroxide
on
the
tooth
which
would
drive
it
in
there
to
get
the
bleaching
effect
sagel
and
dirksing
conclude
that
what
be
need
be
some
way
to
keep
a
very
thin
layer
of
gel
on
the
teeth
they
first
attempt
to
mold
a
thin
wax

sagel
recall
as
thought
about
it
i
say
boh
if
we
could
juxl
find
a
film
that
be
even
thinner
still
think
the
tray
be
thick
we

in
good
shape
in

sagel
go

just
so

glad

sit
there
and

look
at
it

i

this
be
it
tin
be
what
we

on
the

cur
it
