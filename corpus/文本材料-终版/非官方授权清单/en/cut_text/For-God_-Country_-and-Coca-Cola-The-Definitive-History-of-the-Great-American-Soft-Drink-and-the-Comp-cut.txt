to
be
finally
the
young

fell
silent
intent
on
the
old

hung
unmoved

together
they
have
a
special
understand

that
the

give
his
approval
people
say
the

but
goizueta
knew
he
just
need
thing
explain
in
their
simplest
term
this
be
just
like

and
look
at
how
well
that
have

be
convincing
not
so
much
by
his
fact
and
figure
but
by
his
earnestness
he
must
be
right
but
that
didn
t
mean
that
the

be
not
beyond
imagination
however
that
somewhere
in

for
three

the
stubborn

another
reason

glad
to

me
through

that

have
begin

with
an

down
to
the

to
get
a

of

for
pemberton
because
there
be
no

through
the
several
wagon
load
of

into
a

trough
my
best
recollection
be
that
this
process
be
for
the
purpose
of
ripen
the

by
let
it
filter
through
without

there
be
two

it

this
cumbersome
method
of

coca

be
later
abandon
but
pemberton
s
laboratory
certainly
consist
of
more
than
his
kettle
unfortunately
there
be
no
way
of
know
what
this
original
coca

taste
like
after
it
have
be
slowly

a
paper
be
read
in
savannah
in
april
of
pemberton
be
schedule
to
deliver
a
major
speech
to
the
annual
convention
of
the
georgia
pharmaceutical
society
but
he
be
too
close
to
a
satisfactory
formula
to
tear
himself
away
and
travel
all
the
way
to
savannah
instead
he
sent
the
text
of
the
speech
to
be
read
aloud
in
the
paper
he
give
a
detailed
scholarly
account
of
caffeine
and
cocaine
include
the
history
of
both
drug
isolation
and
use
he
note
that
caffeine
as
obtain
from
tea
and
coffee
in
this
country
be
inferior
to
that
manufacture
from
the
kola
nut
by
merck
of
darmstadt
pemberton
s
real
passion
however
be
obviously
the
coca
leaf
all
of
the
medical
journal
be
full
of
its
praise
and
i
be
perplexed
to
know
where
to
begin
and
how
to
end
so
interest
a
subject
he
write
never
in
the
history
of
the
medical
world
have
a
remedial
agent
within
so
short
a
space
of
time
risen
from
comparative
obscurity
to
such
practical
importance
the
article
go
up
like
a
rocket
amidst
the
universal
plaudit
of
the
medical
profession
all
over
the
world
the
veteran
pharmacist
then
enumerate
the
many
benefit
of
coca
include
an
account
of
koller
s
experiment
with
eye
surgery
interestingly
he
make
the
same
point
as
mariani
that
the
peruvian
do
not
value
the
coca
leaf
with
the
large
amount
of
cocaine
prefer
a
milder
leaf
with
a
well
blend
of
alkaloid
pemberton
obviously
have
conduct
extensive
experiment
with
the
coca
leaf
by
this
time
i
must
say
after
considerable
experience
that
of
many
sample
sent
me
by
reputable
house
only
about
one
out
of
one
dozen
sample
prove
to
be
of
any
value
many
of
the
sample
contain
no
coca
whatever
a
historic
name
contest
at
almost
the
exact
moment
this
speech
be
be
read
in
savannah
pemberton
finally
pronounce
himself
satisfied
with
his
new
product
but
he
be
still
call
it
simply
my
temperance
drink
he
need
a
good
name
all
four
of
the
partner
brainstorm
and
submit
potential
title
it
would
be
interest
and
amuse
to
hear
what
they
be
but

for
over

the
fact
that

s
formula
why
do
pemberton
sell
accord
to

it
be
because
he
have
fall
ill
again
and

worried
about
where

would
come
from
both
for

and
his
morphine
which
he
must
have
need
more
than
ever
to
kill
pain
pemberton
and
lowndes
have
be
close
friend
since

the
only
thing
i
have
be

to

it
pemberton
told
him
that
coca
cola
some
day
will
be
a
national
drink
i
want
to
keep
a
third
interest
in
it
so
that
my
son
will
always
have
a
living
shortly
before
the
sale
the
ail
doctor
confide
to
his
nephew
lewis
that
if
only
he
have
the
proper
capital
he
could
make
a
fortune
from
coca
cola
if
i
could
get
i
would
spend
advertising
and
the
remainder
in
make
coca
cola
then
we
would
all
be
rich
with
the
profit
he
envision
endow
a
great
hospital
for
impecunious
son

there
be

next
day
july
robinson
carefully
reconstruct
a
financial
statement
for

probably
from
memory
because
alexander
have
the
book
with
fitting
irony
he
write
it
out
on
pemberton
chemical

the

at

then
however
he

balance

be
decidedly
in

still
he
be
sure
that
in
time
the

would
pay
handsomely
he
persuade
partner
ed
holland
to
accompany
him
to
consult
john
candler
who
have
recently
represent
the
partner
against
alexander
to
see
if
he
didn
t
think
we
could
have
our
right
maintain
candler
an
ambitious
twenty
six
year
old
prosecute
attorney
agree
to
look
into
the
matter
and
paid
a
visit
to
pemberton
still
bedridden
in
what
the
lawyer
described
as
a
small
cheap
house
pemberton
deny
any
wrongdoing
they
be
mistaken
he
say
they
have
get
no
interest
in
coca
cola
whatever
i
have
do
what
they
say
but
i
never
do
give
them
any
right
in
it
nor
their
company
he
sigh
it
don
t
make
much
difference
though
even
if
they
do
have
any
right
i
don
t
know
how
you
would
get
anything
out
of
me
the
lawyer
decide
not
to
take
the
case
because
neither
robinson
holland
nor
pemberton
have
any
money
i
laughingly
told
mr
robinson
i
didn
t
see
much
chance
candler
recall
i
didn
t
care
for
his
case
on
any
contingent
fee
and
that
be
the
end
of
it
as
far
as
the
independently
wealthy
holland
be
concerned
perhaps
the
lawyer
be
right
but
frank
robinson
have
work
hard
for
coca
cola
and
believe
in
the
future
of
the
product
he
wasn
t
about
to
let
the
matter
drop
and
he
didn
t
feel
it
be
a
laugh
matter
robinson
cast
about
for
another
plan
pemberton
may
have
sell
the
right
to
the
formula
but
robinson
still
have
a
copy
of
it
and
he
must
have
felt
legally
entitle
to
it
he
need
to
find
someone
to
purchase
the
right
to
coca

promote
it
properly

less
make
it
after
several
month
lowndes
force
a
change
we
do
very
little
business
that
s
the
truth
he
later
testify
and
it
go
into
the
concern
to
pay
the
expense
i
found
he
wasn
t
handle
it
as
a
thing
of
that
sort
should
be
handle
and
i
told
him
we
have
best
separate
he
buy
or
sell
to
me
accord
to
lowndes
venable
do
indeed
sell
to
him
but
lowndes
couldn
t
find
the
time
to
promote
the
drink
either
i
realize
that
coca
cola
would
die
if
it
do
not
receive
immediate
attention
consequently
i
resolve
to
sell
it
on
december
pemberton
sign
a
note
authorize
the
sale
and
the
next
day
lowndes
with

four
ninth
of
the
total
formula
right
joe
jacob
muddies
the
water
to
confuse

however
venable
somehow
dispose
of
his
portion
of
coca
cola
twice
at
some
point
during
the
fall
of
he
apparently
give
his
share
of
the
drink
to
joseph
jacob
the
owner
of
jacob
pharmacy
as
the
druggist
later
recall
it
thru
some
business
deal
i
acquire
mr
venable
s
share
of

cola
in
lieu
of
some
money
i
have

him
in

west
end
jacob
do
not
sell
to

keep
his

well
into
though
his
memory
be
frustratingly
hazy
and
contradictory
he
later
testify
that
at
the
time
we
bought
coca
cola
moxie
have
a
large
sale
and
we
thought
we
would
make
a

thing
out
of
coca

dr
pemberton
put
this
on
the
market

know
much
about
the

business
which
he
left
entirely
to

while
venable
have
continued
to
make

in
a
small
way
pemberton
kept
harass
jacob
for
advance
on
his
share
of
the
sale
there
be
a
clause
in
the

in
which
dr
pemberton
be
to
have
a
royalty

and

h
bloodworth
one
more
person
have
almost
certainly
enter
the
picture
by
this
point
asa
candler
the
old
brother
of
lawyer
john
candler
in
his
search
for
a
savior
frank
robinson
have
found
his
well
capitalize
industrious
businessman
the
epitome
of
the
ambitious
atlanta
druggist
candler
be
always
look
for
a
likely
new
product
but
he
be
cautious
about
spending
money
robinson
have
a
difficult
time
convincing
candler
that
coca
cola
be
a
worthwhile
venture
finally
galvanize
him
by
conjure
a
prophetic
vision
see
that
wagon
go
by
with
all
those
empty
beer
keg
well
we
be
go
to
push
coca
cola
until
you
see
the
wagon
go
by
with
coca
cola
just
like
that
though
asa
candler
do
not
appear
in
any
coca
cola
document
until
he
insist
in
later
testimony
that
he
have
become
involve
the
previous
year
i
have
the
whole
control
of
it
coca
cola
as
far
as
the
business
be
concerned
in
curiously
however
he
add
i
don
t
know
whether
i
have
bought
it
or
not
at
that
time
explain
that
he
acquire
the
drink
in
return
for
debt
owe
him
by
certain
gentleman
later
he
intervene
into
the
affair
of
this
pemberton
chemical
company
while
vague
about
exactly
how
he
become
involve
with
coca
cola
candler
be
positive
about
one
thing
robinson
have
manufacture
it
collect
it
all
and
do
everything
else
before
robinson
might
have
be
call
my
agent
candler
s
muddy
statement
becomes
clearer
when
we
compare
it
with
his
last
courtroom
testimony
in
in
it
he
say
he
thought
he
have
purchase
the
coca
cola
formula
from
joe
jacob
but
add
i
be
not
certain
about
it
what
he
be
absolutely
clear
about
be
that
frank
robinson
have
give
him
the
actual
formula
obviously
after
robinson
brought
him
the
direction
for
manufacturing
coca
cola
candler
then
have
to
obtain
legal
possession
a
process
that
would
be
not
only
confuse
but
highly
suspicious
with
the
opening
of
the
soda
fountain
season
in
march
of
candler
officially
begin
to
take
control
of
coca
cola
during
that
spring
joe
jacob
complain
to
his
friend
asa
candler
about
pemberton
s
constant
request
for
money
candler
without
appear
too
eager
offer
to
take
the
drink
off
his
hand
in
return
for
some
stock
in
a

to

the
uninsured

burn
soon
afterward
though
jacob
kick
himself
for
the
stupid
barter
in
subsequent
year
he
remain
lifelong
friend
with
candler
charley
pemberton
stake
his
claim
meanwhile
mayfield
bloodworth
and
murphey
have
settle
in
and
on
january
they
have
form
a
copartnership
with
pemberton
call
the
pemberton
medicine
company
in
which
pemberton
specifically
give
them
the

to
all
of

his
new
lemon
and
orange
elixir
after
move
to
a
well
location
on
pryor
street
the
partner
commenced
production
naively
unaware
of
the
disintegration
of
the
pemberton
chemical
company
or
the
sale
of
coca
cola
mayfield
ran
the
laboratory
bloodworth
take
to
the
road
as
a
travel
salesman
and
murphey
kept
the
book
the
only
discordant
note
seem
to
be
mayfield
s
rather
stormy
marriage
diva
mayfield
often
help
her
husband
in
the
laboratory
and
their
argument
make
murphey
and
bloodworth
uncomfortable
within
a
few
month
however
trouble
appear
in
the
person
of
charley
pemberton
who
have
return
from
a
drug
firm
in
louisville
kentucky
to
claim
his
birthright
he
demand
that
mayfield
relinquish
the
manufacturing
job
to
him
mayfield
refuse
charley
be
disgruntle
dissatisfied
and
make
it
up
for
the
old
man
dr
pemberton
mayfield
say
later
the
doctor
come
to
us
and
told
us
that
he
would
have
to
give
that
the
son
contend
that
he
have
promise
him
the
coca
cola
business
of
course
it
be
a
bomb
in
our
camp
charley
whom
mayfield
regard
as
disagreeable
a
drinking
kind
of
boy
begin
throw
tantrum
booze
wheedle
and
put
his
father
in
an
awkward
position
dr
pemberton
finally
told
the
partner
he
have
sign
the
right
to
coca
cola
over
to
charley
some
time
previously
but
hadn
t
remember
it
until
then
he
blame
his
lapse
of
memory
on
his
morphine
habit
for
a
while
there
be
no
resolution
to
the
matter
we
ran
along
there
quite
a
little
while
thereafter
undecided
just
what
to
do
mayfield
remember
as
matter
simmer
the
partner
be
far
disillusion
with
pemberton
when
they
discover
that
asa
candler
have
quietly
maneuver
to
gain
legal
control
of
coca
cola
form
a
new
company
with
charley
pemberton
and
dr

as

open
candler
s
company
be
brewing
coca
cola
faster
than
they
be
and

it
hard

company
on

charley

in

for

company
candler
soon
regret
both
the
incorporation
and
the
partnership
with
the
immature
pemberton
who
prove
to
be
more
a
liability
than
a
help
although
much
of
the
word
be
probably
boiler
plate
for
such
document
it
be
nonetheless
instructive
to
see
what
they
plan
the
purpose
of
this
company
will
be
the
manufacturing
of
coca
cola
syrup
the
buying
of
ingredient
and
appliance
necessary
therefor
and
the

article
as
a
syrup
in
bulk
bottle
as
a
medicine
and
as
a
nerve
tonic
and
they
desire
the
privilege
of
extend
such
manufacturing
to
other
specialty
of
like
kind
the
capital
stock
of
say
company
shall
be
twelve
thousand

more
than
ten

have
already

the
principal

but
petitioner
desire
the
privilege
of
establish
branch
office
or
factory
elsewhere
like
all
other
incorporation
this
one
would
last
for
twenty
year
before
renewal
the
petition

that

of

agree
that

the

but
at

one
of
the

it

that

perhaps
with

forge

he
never

her
his

suspiciously
providential
for

but
that
s
not
the
end
of
the

john

on
the
crucial

way
out

for
this

to
be
genuine
the
write
be
not
smooth
and
fast
but
rather
slow
and
unsure
wonder
where
to
go
next
this
be
a
simulated
signature
and
not
a
very
good
one
at
that
though
there
be
no
way
to
know
with
any
certainty
charley
pemberton
be
the
most
likely
one
to
have
forge
the
signature
at
the
same
time
he
try
to
contrast
and
obscure
his
own
handwrite
by
signing
with
a
large
flourish
and
much
spill
ink
but
why
would
charley
pemberton
have
commit
the
forgery
do
he
really
need
the
result
that
badly
it
be
more
probable
that
he
have
make
some
kind
of
deal
with
asa
candler
candler
apparently
write
the
body
of
the
contract
itself
in
his
distinctively
hasty
script
although
it
be
difficult
and
presumptuous
to
play
armchair
detective
so
many
year
later
it
seem
likely
that
candler
be
the
shadowy
figure
behind
both
the
pemberton
and
dozier
forgery
which
occur
within

of

from
mr

after
the

elberta

if

from

he

and
as
asa

she
felt
sure
he
would
keep

the
blame
for
the

of

on
the
dissolute
charley

in

which
he

spent

of
the

the

of

be
well
know
in

that
his

be
a
physician
of

and
repeat
that
charley
have
inherit
the
formula
which
he
afterwards
dispose
of
for
a
comparatively
small
sum
although
charley
be
an
acknowledge
alcoholic
this
be
the
first
indication
that
he
take
opium
his
death
could
have
result
from
an
accidental
overdose
suicide
or
murder
a

write
that
there
be
something
mysterious
about
charley
s
death
monroe
king
a
pemberton
expert
believe
that
suicide
be
unlikely
remember
that
charley
pemberton
have
work
for
year
with
his
father
and
knew
the
drug
trade
intimately
he
would
have
chosen
a
much
more
effective
way
to

have
he
chosen
to
do
so
take
raw
opium

make
no

at

asa

must
have
be
relieve
that
the
unpredictable
unstable
pemberton
be
go
the
allegation
of
some
sort
of
questionable
activity
be
verify
by

gilbert
a
lawyer
who
apparently
do
a
good
deal
of
work
for
asa
candler
gilbert
told
a
friend
that
if
i
told
what
i
knew
about
the
early
day
of
coca
cola
what
i
say
would
be
very
embarrass
add
that
i
m
not
go
to
tell
the
maneuvering
we
do
to
keep
afloat
in
the
early
day
of
the
company
in
during
one
of
the
company
s
move
to
large
quarter
asa
candler
over
the
objection
of
his
nephew
order
that
the
early
record
of
the
coca
cola
company
be
burn
leave
only
the
official
chain
of
title
intact
beyond
that
only
circumstantial
evidence
and
rumor
remain
to
haunt
him
as
rusty
and
weak
as
the
chain
of
title
may
be
though
it
be
quite
likely
that
we
would
view
coca
cola
extract
and
syrup
as
just
one
more
quaint
creation
of
dr
pemberton
if
asa
candler
have
not
take
control
of
it
in
the
end
rob
stephen
yet
another
relation
of
mr
pemberton
be
probably
correct
when
he
write
coca
cola
become
a
go
because
it
be
push
and
push
by
an
energetic
man
if
the
pembertons
have
not
sell
the
formula
it
probably
would
have
stayed
in
an
old
drink
somewhere
and
be
lose
in
time
i
think
cousin
cliff
always
thought
mr
candler
robbed
her
and
charley
but
i
doubt
if
it
can
be
say
he
do
he
paid
them
for
something
of
no
use
to
them
and
he
make
it
a
go
by
his
own
effort

the
contract
specify
that
mr
dozier
be
to
get
a
third
and
walker
the
balance
because
they
be
buying
two
third
of
the
entire
formula
that
come
out
to
these
odd
fraction
it
appear
that
although
candler
claimed
that
he
have
exercise
full
control
over
coca
cola
since
late
he
be
only
now
get
around
to
taste
it
and
he
still
couldn
t
spell
it
correctly
or
perhaps
he
be
only
now
try
it
as
a
cure
for
his
perennial
headache
it
be
likely
that
the
refer
to
candler
s
contribution
to
the
coca
cola
company
capitalization
if
candler
really
be
the
sole
buyer
why
would
he
bother
to
camouflage
it
john
pemberton
probably
bore
a
grudge
against
candler
for
buying
out
his
entire
stock
of
drug
and
lab
equipment
five
year
earlier
when
pemberton
be
too
sick
to
protect
himself
from
predatory
partner
the
sick
inventor
have
sue
candler
along
with
everyone
else
involve
in
a
bitter
affidavit
pemberton
write
that
he
be
now
lie
perfectly
helpless
and
utterly
dependent
upon
the
proceeds
of
the
partnership
if
allow
to
proceed
the
sale
would
be
his
present
and
utter
ruin
nonetheless
pemberton
lose

image
of
the
big
business
man
but
even
as
a
youth
he
be
the
quintessential
capitalist
born
on

happy
rural

in
spanish
to
attract
others
who
have
the
gold

he
must
have
pass
on
this
spirit
of
enterprise
and
promotion
despite
his
relative
wealth
however
asa
candler
s
father
do
not
believe
in
spoil
his
child
they
earn
every
penny
of
their
spending
money
asa
soon
prove
that
he
would
do
almost
anything
for
a
dollar
he
once
chase
down
a
wild
mink
which
bit
him
severely
when
he
finally
caught
it
as
candler
told
the
story
i
hadn
t
heard
of
people
sell
mink
skin
but
it
seem
to
me
it
might
be
a
good
idea
and
i
decide
to
try
atlanta
be
thirty
six
mile
away
and
there
be
no
railroad
but
that
seem
to
be
the
best
possible
market
so
i
sent
the
skin
in
to
town
by
wagon
and
i
say
to
myself
maybe
i
ll
get
twenty
five
cent
i
get
a
dollar
the
first
i
have
ever
make
thrill
the
young
candler
soon
organize
other
child
to
do
the
mink
trap
for
him
and
he
establish
a
regular
atlanta
trade
on
the
return
wagon
he
purchase
straight
pin
for
resale
in
villa
rica
and
learn
a
lesson
he
would
later
apply
to
coca
cola
there
be
good
money
to
be
make
from
penny
and
nickel
sale
seem
you
couldn
t
make
anything
off
pin
doesn
t
it
but
when
i
go
away
to
school
i
have
more
than
save
up
through
the
sale
of
mink
skin
and
speculation
in

that
infuriate
candler
on

just
a

after
deposit
his

of

coca

drinking
be
the
indignant
citizen
say
a
very
vicious
and
pernicious
thing
and
people
be
drinking
it
a
dozen
time
a
day
the
informant
assert
that
the
ingredient
which
make
coca

so
popular
be
cocaine
there
be
evidently
enough
of
it
in

to
affect
people
and
it
be
insiduously
but
surely
get
thousand
of
people
into
the

habit
he
then
related
the
story
of
his
friend
who
in
despair
over
his
inability
to
shake
the
cocaine
habit
have
shot
himself
the
implication
of
course
be
that
drinking

be
the

step
on
the
road
to

destruction
candler
respond
by
take
out
an
ad
in

he
challenged
anyone
to
prove
a
case
in
which
coca
cola
have
lead
to
cocaine
addiction
if
i
thought
it
could
possibly
hurt
anybody
he
assert
i
would
quit
the
manufacture
of
coca
cola
instantly
he
state
that
the
formula
for
coca
cola
call
for
only
a
half
ounce
of
coca
leaf
per
gallon
of
syrup
and
that
no
sensible
man
would
undertake
to
say
that
this
quantity
in
a
gallon
would
hurt
a
person
take
a
glass
of
the
beverage
if
candler
be
give
accurate
information
he
be
certainly
correct
that
a
glass
of
coca
cola
have
a
negligible
amount
of
cocaine
in
it
amount
to
about
milligram
either
candler
be
lie
however
or
he
have
substantially
reduce
the
amount
of
coca
leaf
in
the
formula
because
the
pemberton

for
eleven

claimed
to

nonetheless
rumor
about

would
continue

the

in

the

proclaim
because
coca
cola
have
become
a
national
drink
a
close
look
at
company
finance
reveals
how
money
be
spent
and
make
candler
paid
for
the
ingredient
of
the
gallon
of
syrup
he
sell
cent
per
gallon
or
less
than
half
a

at
the

time
he
spent

on

discount
interest
that
last
figure
include
salary
which
be
as
howard
candler
later
admit
moderate
and
in
some
instance
inadequate
if
candler
could
have
effectively
retail
his
drink
directly
to
consumer
his
profit
would
have
be
incredible
because
his
total
disbursement
come
to
just
under
for
a
gallon
of
syrup
sell
for
drink
at
a
nickel
apiece
rather
than
expand
his
work
and
sale
force
however
he
chose
to
spread
the
profit
among
distributor
and
fountain
owner
who
would
sell
for
him
in
each
territory
he
sought
out
jobber
usually
candy
or
drug
wholesaler
with
whom
he
could
set
up
a
long
term
trust
relationship
he
sell
the
syrup
to
them
at
an
average
cost
of
per
gallon
in
leave
himself
a
profit
of
thirty
cent
a
gallon
and
allow
a
whop
markup
for
both
jobber
and
retailer
that
small
profit
margin
translate
into
huge
influx
of
cash
as
the
total
gallonage
sale
rise
steadily
by
the
begin
of
the
company
have
a
surplus
cash
war
chest
of
almost
by
the
end
of
that
year
the
company
need
new
quarter
and
there
be
plenty
of
money
to
build
them
in
to
the
relief
of
the
pawnshop
and
saloon
coca

move
to
large
rent
space
at

affair
and
a

hold

be

but
this
space
be
also
soon
inadequate
thus
at
the
december
annual
meeting
be
allocate
to
buy
a
lot
and
begin
construction
the
pulse

every

however
asa

be
on
the

of
a
complete
mental
and
physical
collapse
he
have
overwork
himself
to
the

of

and
even
repeat

the

another
sign
of
the

come

that

be
the
need
for

have

do
its

it
be

that
cut
most

into

with

also
maintain

an
important

have
be

the

hung
in

if
there
be
anything
the
matter
with
it
do
you

we
would

such
a

surprised
at
the

because
it

common
knowledge
that

never
spent
a
dime
he
didn
t
have
to
the
company
must
have
be
do
very
well
indeed
an
omission
there
be
one
item
of
business
that
appear
too
trivial
to
mention
at
this
meeting
back
in
july
two
tennessee
lawyer
have
come
to
atlanta
to
see
asa
candler
about
a
business
proposition
they
want
to
bottle
coca

candler
told
the
reporter
that
coca
cola
be
introduce
to
the
public
a
little
over
a
year
ago
in
a
modest
way
its
inventor
be
unable
to
devote
to
it
the
mean
necessary
to
its
general
introduction
to
the
public
it
be
interest
that
pemberton
s
name
be
carefully
avoid
here
though
he
have
be
dead
less
than
a
year
and
be
well
know
in
atlanta
candler
be
already
minimize
the
inventor
s
contribution
note
too
that
he
move
the
introduction
of
coca
cola
to
a
little
over
a
year
ago
rather
than
the
actual
amount
of

upon

that
perhaps
his
fortune
lay
in
bottle
the
popular
soda

when
thomas
told

laugh
at
him
as
usual
but
say
that
he
actually
might
help
with
this
one
because
it
happen
that

cousin
he
soon
arrange
an
introduction
for
the

train

serious
sam

choice
wasn

interested

discussion
thomas
persuade

he
also
note
that
the

fountain
drink
they
brought
back
to
their
office
go
flat
while
they
talk
to
client
wouldn
t
it
be
great
if
a
fellow
could
put
this
stuff
in
a
bottle
and
stop
it
up
so
the
gas
wouldn
t
get
away
and
he
could
drink
it
whenever
he

the
two
men
met
with
a
harry
asa
candler
in
mid
july
he
be
annoyed
to
find
thomas
pester
him
again
in
addition
he
wasn
t
particularly
impressed
with
anyone
from
chattanooga
which
he
consider
a
hick
town
i
go
up
there
once
to
bring
back
a
fugitive
nigger
candler
later
say
and
i
didn
t
think
there
be
anything
up
there
his
initial
impression
of
thomas
and
whitehead
must
not
have
be
favorable
either
thomas
thirty
eight
be
a
heavyset
man
with
a
florid
sweaty
face
whitehead
though
a
few
year
young
walk
with
a
pronounce
waddle
carry
nearly
two
hundred
pound
on
his
frame
besides
candler
be
wary
of
the
bottle
business
he
remember
that
woolfolk
walker
have
already
bottle
coca
cola
briefly
back
in
and
the
product
have
be
to
use
nephew
sam
dobbs
term
putrid
at
that
time
candler
have
vehemently
forbidden
dobbs
to
sell
coca
cola
in
bottle
he
already
have
enough
problem
defend
his
drink
without
allow
the
promotion
of
an
inferior
product
mostly
though
he
be
simply
too
busy
to
think
about
bottle
coca
cola
as
he
recount
the
conversation
year
later
candler
told
them
gentleman
i
don
t
think
we
want
to
have
it
bottle
we
can
t
handle
it
ourselves
there
s
too
much
detail
about
the
bottle
business
in
summary
candler
say
he
have
neither
the
money
nor
time
nor
brain
to
embark
in
the
bottle
business
and
there
be
too
many
folk
who
be
not
responsible
who
care
nothing
about
the
reputation
of
what
they
put
up
and
i
be
afraid
the
name
will
be
injured
although
thomas
and
whitehead
may
not
have
be
impressive
at
first
they
be
born
salesman
friendly
and
jovial
they
listen
to
everything
candler
say
nod
with
understand
then
speak
easily
and
well
they
described
their
plan
assure
candler
that
they
would
maintain
the
purity
and
integrity
of
coca
cola
no
doubt
make
it
the
best
know
bottle
drink
in
the
united
state
the
same
way
that
he
candler
have
so
brilliantly
make
it
the
most
famous
soda
fountain
drink
warm
to
their
subject
the
men
conclude
with
a
sincere
burst
worthy
of
their
best
courtroom
oratory
we
promise
and
guarantee
to
you
mr
candler
that
in
all
the
business
we
do
in
the
bottle
of
coca
cola
we
will
make
the
name
well
every
day
we
conduct
this
business
they
weren
t
try
to
rush
him
though
he
should
take
the
matter
under
advisement
sample
their
bottle
product
and
think
it
over
they
would
be
in
town
a
few
day
candler
his
ego
flatter
and
interest
pique
visibly
soften
he
have
to
admit
that
thomas
be
persistent
a
good
trait
for
a
coca
cola
man
that
s
a
big
contract
you
have
take
on
your
hand
i
have
already
spent
all
the
money
i
have
try
to
make
it
respectable
he
told
them
he
would
have
to
look
into
their
background
and
would
let
them
know
his
decision
in
a
few
day
in
the
meantime
they
should
prepare
a
suitable
contract
candler
must
have
be
pleased
that
both
men
be
lawyer
he
be
increasingly
come
to
rely
on
men
of
their
profession
thomas
also
have
a
varied
entrepreneurial
background
include
experience
with
patent
medicine
with
satisfaction
candler
note
that
whitehead
s
father
be
a
baptist
minister
hopefully
whitehead
would
bring
a
religious
fervor
to
the
coca
cola
business
in
addition
it
didn
t
hurt
that
he
specialized
in
tax
law
in
light
of
the
pending
litigation
over
the
war
tax
finally
whitehead
too
be
already
involve
in
patent
medicine
as
the
vice
president
of
the
new
spencer
medicine
company
give
away
the
bottle
right
on
july
asa
candler
call
the
men
back
into
his
office
to
approve
their
plan
casually
the
partner
hand
him
the
six
hundred
word
contract
they
have
prepared
and
sign
after
carefully
reading
it
over
candler
also
sign
the
document
clearly
relieve
thomas
and
whitehead
assure
candler
that
he
would
not
regret
it
and
turn
to
go
before
he
change
his
mind
candler
call
after
them
if
you
boy
fail
in
this
undertaking
don
t
come
back
to
cry
on
my
shoulder
because
i
have
very
little
confidence
in
this
bottle
business
candler
must
have
believe
he
have
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
under
the
contract
s
term
it
bound
the
bottler
to
use
only
coca
cola
syrup
ban
any
substitute
and
it
expressly
exclude
the
soda
fountain
business
which
would
remain
the
sole
province
of
the
coca
cola
company
in
addition
the
contract
specify
that
if
the
bottler
fail
to
supply
the
demand
in
all
territory
embrace
in
this
agreement
the
contract
would
be
forfeit
it
be
little
wonder
that
candler
have
told
them
they
have
a
big
contract
on
their
hand
the
territory
include
almost
the
entire
united
state
exclude
only
new
england
held
by
seth
fowle
son
though
they
never
bottle
there
and
texas
and
mississippi
where
noncontract
businessmen
be
already
put

candler
be
correct
that
the

candler
set
no

as
thomas

fulfil
their

there

in
the

as
if
it

the
real
genesis
of

the

ten

i
do
a

the

now
my

sometimes
the
extract
underwent
some
funny
change
and
taste
horrible
the
bottler
complain
raspberry
and
pop
be
affected
by
sunlight
and
their
flavor
change
to
that
of
turpentine
the
raspberry
go
bad
because
it
have
no
raspberry
in
it
but
cheap
chemical
ether
the
main
reason
the
bottler
have
such
trouble
however
be
the
uncertain
seal
a
problem
widely
recognize
within
the

in
a

the

although
a

by
over
three

american
bottler

with
an

the
question

why
two
lawyer
get
the
notion
to

coca

in
but
why
no
one
have
thought
of
it
sooner
in
fact
they
have
sam
dobbs
remember
that
there
be
at

a
dozen
pre
coca

bottler
in
florida
colorado
georgia
south
carolina
texas
mississippi
and
new

two
of
those

be
convince
that
it
would
do
equally
well
in
rural
area
which
have
no

consequently
in
he
begin
bottle
carbonate

to

who
write
back
that
it
be
fine
and
thought
no
more
about
it
the
biedenharn
brother
all
seven
of

create
a

similarly

that
the

the

cause
a
not

for
a
period
of
ten

in

as
the

incorporate
though
the
crimped
crown
bottle
cap
solve
all
of
the
hutchinson
problem
its
acceptance
be
glacially
slow
because
it
require
a
new
stock
of

a
special

to
attach
the

however
the
change

thomas

no
time
in
set
up
their
first
plant
in
chattanooga
bottle
in
that
era

a
dangerous
makeshift
affair
that

but
the

often
come
loose
with
sticky

it
be
little
wonder
that
thomas

quickly
decide
to
leave
the
actual

to
others
on
november
they

the

it
spoke
volume
for
the
future
of
the

revolutionary
new

allow
the

to
reach
a
completely
different
class
of

at
the
time
no
one
in

paid
much
attention
an
article

adjacent
to
that

carry

on
december
within
a
year
the

shatter
thomas

disagreed
about
almost
everything
except
the
desirability
of
bottle
the
soft
drink
thomas
want
to
use
brown

while
whitehead
favor

thomas
thought
each
bottle
should
contain
eight
ounce
whitehead
opt
for
a
little
over
six
ounce
but
the
more
serious
conflict
begin
when
the
time
come
to
execute
additional
contract
with
other
bottler
thomas
believe
in
two
year
contract
so
that
he
could
replace
a
poor
bottler
if
there
be
problem
whitehead
want
to
give
permanent
contract
to
reinforce
loyalty
and
enthusiasm
finally
the
two
men
agree
to
split
their
territory
to
assure
an
equitable
division
whitehead
create
the
two
territory
while
thomas
chose
the
one
he
want
he
must
have
enjoy
a
challenge
because
he
picked
the
heavily
populate
eastern
seaboard
and
the
west
coast
in
addition
to
chattanooga
and
a
fifty
mile

around
it
that
left
whitehead
with
the

heartland
of
the
south
plus
much
of
the
west
whitehead
may
have

he

t
to

inevitable
confusion
the
two
firm
be
more
commonly
call
the
thomas
company
and
the
southeastern
parent
bottler
it
be
obvious
from
the
begin
that
neither
concern

the
money

to

instead
both

with
a

a

of

it

thomas

they
would

consequently
the

become

lupton

it

rapidly
acquire

lupton
be
right

man
who
would
even
consider

and
he
be
afraid
the
pop
bottler
would
ruin

why
he
wait
over
ten

before
he

fought
hard
for
their

even
for
them
it

him
point
out
that
soda
pop
be
almost
universally

the

also
unhappy
with

with
the

obviously
go

impractical
to

in
addition
these
direct
employee
of
the

bad

that
by
insist
on
a

of
half
of
the

they
might
well
bankrupt
their

these
reason
whitehead

they
immediately

through
to

thomas
and
whitehead
abandon
their
obligation
to
place
an
employee
spy
with
each
actual
bottler
rather
than
take
half

they
now
switch
to
a
straight
royalty
of
six
cent

or
a
quarter
cent
per
bottle
give
the
increase
demand
this
seemingly
small
levy
would
make
the

bottler
millionaire
within

for
simple
syrup
to
his
bottler
by
add
caramel

stretch
a
gallon
of
coca
cola
syrup
so
that
it
would
yield
bottle
in
the
ensue
month
thomas
engage
in
considerable
correspondence
about
the
proportion
of
this
saccharin
mixture
because
it
result
in
slight
variation
in
color
acidity
and
sweetness
write
to
his
pittsburgh
bottler
thomas
say
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
make
a
mistake
in
have
your
coca
cola
too
sweet
i
be
sure
that
it
taste
well
than
that
which
be
not
so
sweet
he
go
on
to
say
that
taste
vary
regard
the
proper
amount
of
acidity
in
thomas
defense
he
be
probably
add
saccharin
not
only
because
it
be
cheaper
than
sugar
but
because
it
act
as
a
preservative
from
the
outset
he
have
be
plague
by
a
cloudy
drink
that
deposit
an
unpleasant
sediment
at
first
he
blame
the
hutchinson
faulty
seal
when
the
problem
continued
with
the
crown
cork
he
decide
that
pollute
water
must
be
the
cause
an
amateur
chemist
thomas
tinker
with
pasteurization
of
coca
cola
but
it
kill
the
taste
eventually
he
devise
a
system
of
cleaning
the
water
with
alum
and
recommend
filter
the
syrup
before
use
as
well
parent
bottler
pioneer
or
pirate
the
effort
of
thomas
have
be
emphasize
here
simply
because
no
similar
record
have
survive
from
whitehead
and
lupton
it
be
obvious
from
the
correspondence
between
thomas
and
whitehead
that
both
men
deserve
full
credit
for
building
the
coca
cola
bottle
business
whitehead
frazzle
by
overwork
die
of
pneumonia
in
at
forty
two
and
thomas
follow
at
fifty
two
in
they
have
see
the
future
far
more
clearly
than
asa

they
create
the

of

they
brought
coca

to
the
mass

later
during

court

between
the

company

would
denigrate
the

of
the

out
that

never
even
saw
the
coca
cola

that
be
ship
directly
to
the

bottler
why
should
they
have
a
perpetual
right
to
their
royalty
in
later
year
there
be
certainly
some
validity
to
those
argument
and
the
coca
cola
company
eventually
bought
back
the
parent
bottler
to
avoid
this
unnecessary
tithe
but
in
these
early
year
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
parent
bottler
perform
the
essential
job
of
recruiting

initially

there
may
have
be
vestige
of

add
that

such
like

hard
to

themselves
from

it

state
that
quite
a
number
of
the
soft

dispense
at
soda
fountain
contain
cocaine
and
that
these
drink
serve
to
unconsciously
cultivate
the
habit
during
his
testimony
in
the
trial
against
the
irs
candler
admit
that
there
be
a
very
small
proportion
of
cocaine
in
coca
cola
with
mount
frustration
he
listen
to
physician
testify
on
the
effect
of
the
coca
cola
habit
one
atlanta
doctor
cite
the
case
of
a
thirteen
year
old
boy
who
usually
drank
ten
to
twelve
glass
per
day
but
lose
his
job
and
be
suddenly
unable
to
buy
coca
cola
he
come
to
my
office
the
day
after
in
a
very
nervous
almost
collapse
condition
state
to
me
that
he
could
not
get
his
coca
cola
and
that
he
knew
something
be
the
matter
with
him
another
doctor
say
that
his
neurasthenic
partner
be
very
strangely
affected
by
drinking
coca
cola
if
he
take
a
glass
he
can
t
find
his
way
home
perhaps
the
poor
man
drank
a
double
or
quadruple
dose
since
atlanta
druggist
be
in
the
habit
of
use
anywhere
from
one
to
four
ounce
of
syrup
per
glass
accord
to
one
witness
all
of
these
statement
come
from
the
trial
but
candler
have
already
heard
similar
testimony
during
the
first
irs
trial
which
have
end
in
july
of
with
a
hung
jury
at
some
point
during
the
first
trial
the
accumulation
of
such
testimony
combine
with
adverse
press
coverage
and
the
spread
of
bottle
coca
cola
among
black
consumer
force
him
to
remove
the
cocaine
his
first
attempt
be
only
partially
successful
which
explains
why
a
chemist
found
four
hundredth
of
a
grain
of
cocaine
per
ounce
of
syrup
in
it
also
account
for
candler
s
curious
stumble
answer
at
one
point
when
he
be
ask
how
much
cocaine
be
in
coca
cola
if
we
get
all
of
it
but
we
don
t
treat
it
the
lawyer
save
him
by
interrupt
with
another
question
no
wonder
candler
be
smitten
with
severe
headache
while
on
the
witness
stand
soon
afterward
in
august
of
candler
contract
with
the
schaefer
alkaloid
work
of
maywood
new
jersey
to
decocainize
the
coca
leaf
before
send
merchandise
no
on
to
atlanta
the
exact
date
of
candler
s
first
attempt
to
remove
cocaine
cannot
be
pinpoint
but
it
be
probably
in
that
january
coca
cola
distribute
a
defensive
pamphlet
what
be
it
coca
cola
what
it
be
in
which
candler
admit
a
small
amount
of
cocaine
the
pamphlet
contain
an
analysis
which
say
it
would
require
about
thirty
glass
to
make
an
ordinary
dose
of
the
drug
the
text
also
praise
the
coca
leaf
which
make
one
active
brilliant
vigorous
and
able
to
accomplish
great
task
easily
it
seem
clear
then
that
at
the
begin
of
cocaine
be
still
in
the
drink
but
most
of
it
have
be
remove
by
the
follow
year
the
removal
of
the
cocaine
present
a
delicate
public
relation
problem
if
the
company
respond
to
attack
by
tell
the
truth
they
would
be
admit
that
the
drink
do
once
have
cocaine
in
it
the
implication
would
be
that
they
have
remove
it
because
it
be
harmful
which
might
even
open
the
door
to
lawsuit
besides
it
be
unthinkable
to
admit
that
coca
cola
have
ever
be
anything
but
pure
and
wholesome
finally
of
course
they
didn
t
want
the
public
to
know
that
one
of
the
drink
s
more
entice
ingredient
be
now
miss
consequently
candler
orchestrate
a
mighty
revision
of
coca
cola
history
perhaps
convincing
himself
in
the
process
in
later
year
he
repeatedly
deny
under
oath
that
the
drink
have
ever
have
cocaine
in
it
even
today
the
company
feel
compel
to
deny
it
after
instead
of
bragging
about
the
removal
of
cocaine
the
company
pour
on
the
advertising

another
explanation
for

of

be
the

it
be
surprising
that
there
be
no

in

those

after

be
more
logical
for

even
though

sale
grow
enormously
in
the
first
decade
of
the

the

resolutely
ignore
them
presumably
because
the

that
a

of

not

take
on

for
a
few
month
it
appear
that
all
would
be
well
but
early
in
asa
candler
picked
up
a
paper

read
the
headline

take

clearly
wiley

claimed
to
remove

he
say
coca

s
caffeine
content
be
subject
to
investigation
candler
write
to
wiley
on
february
to
complain
that
his
statement
would
work
vast
deteriment
to
his
drink
s
sale
and
offer
wiley
the
plain
fact
that
coca
cola
be
a
harmless
non
alcoholic
beverage
it
contains
no
cocaine
nor
any
deleterious
drug
he
stress
add
that
a
serve
of
the
soft
drink
contain
about
as
much
caffeine
as
a
weak
cup
of
tea
there
can
be
no
more
objection
to
the
consumption
of
caffeine
in
the
form
of
coca
cola
than
there
be
to
the
importation
of
tea
and
coffee
and
their
use
candler
conclude
we
therefore
ask
you
most
respectfully
to
give
your
endorsement
to
the
meritorious
cause
to
which
we
have
devote
our
energy
candler
may
be
forgiven
for
believe
that
this
would
resolve
the
matter
but
he
didn
t
understand
how
harvey
wiley

mind
work
in
many
way
candler
and

wiley
have
actually
earn
a
medical
degree
but
never
practice
instead
become
a

their
most
important
similarity
however
be
an
almost
fanatical
belief
in
the
righteousness
and
correctness
of
their

wiley
take
his

seriously

you
be
right
and
then

ahead

use

when
he
say

be
no
more
harmful
than
a

for

however
there
be
a
clear
difference
everyone
knew
that

such
also

ominously
wiley
end
by
reassure

that
the

not
do
anything
that
be

the

thus
the

the

at

have
numerous
new

and
since
august
with
inside
help
from
dobbs
he
have
be
maneuvering
behind
the
scene
to
pull
off
the

that
have
be
scuttle
twice
before
after
the
barrel
case
be
settle
in
november
they
proceed
with
an
informal
understand
that
the
sale
would
indeed
take
place
it
be
ernest
woodruff
who
have
mastermind
the
creation
of
the
beneficial
ownership
certificate
a
complex
arrangement
that
would
prevent
any
single
shareholder
from
derail
the
purchase
of
the
company
yet
again
it
be
due
to
his
influence
that
the
new
factory
on
north
avenue
be
built
adjacent
to
land
own
by
woodruff
and
his
son
across
which
the
company
would
need
a
railroad
easement
woodruff
now
confirm
that
certain
interest
would
offer
the
same
price
of
million
besides
the
threat
of
the
koke
case
dobbs
realize
there
be
powerful
tax
incentive
favor
a
sale
which
would
greatly
reduce
the
accumulate
earnings
tax
and
as
important
the
excess
profit
tax
that
have
arrive
with
the
war
the
government
taxed
the
company
on
excess
earnings
above
a
reasonable
percentage
of
its
tiny
capitalization
enthusiastically
dobbs
agree
to
take
the
woodruff
proposition
back
to
atlanta

the

the

so
tight
with

that
he

woodruff

what
would
now
be
call
a
friendly
leveraged

the

would

the

the

presumably
the

would
come
from
other

the

do
not

with

initially
they

complain

should
be
yellow
and
red
with

the
real
issue
of

be
whether

be

not

he
be
horrify
when

in

he
would
soon
find

mr

the

protest
it
don

do
no
good
to

the

it
ll
just
look
like
this
again
there
be
a
moment
of
tense
silence
as

slowly
take
his

out

into

you
wipe

you
woodruff
say
with
that
he
replace
the
cigar
and
left
while
this
piece
of
company
folklore
may
be
exaggerated
there
be
no
question
that
robert
woodruff
could
and
do
make
the
bottler
acutely
uncomfortable
notably
by
manipulate
the
amount
of

cooperation
he
extend
beyond
the
minimal
amount
specify
in
their

the
bottler
soon
get
the
message
if
you
played
ball
with
woodruff
if
you
be
a
good
boy
you
be
reward
with

woodruff

another

love
to

out
that

in

have
to
go

horsey

final
recommendation
be
to
commence
bottle
in

commit
to
a
three
year
introductory
period
he
suggest
import

purpose
since
it

in
addition
a
separate
british
corporation
entirely
under
control
of
the
coca
cola
company
should
be
set
up
since
a
prospective
consumer
do
not
become
enthusiastic
when
he
first
taste
it
horsey
predict
that
the
work
of
the
english
company
in
the
begin
will
be
similar
to
the
pioneer
work
do
in
america
forty
year
ago
woodruff
do
not
actually
implement
horsey
s
suggestion
in
england
until
probably
because
he
fail
to
secure
sufficient
fund
from
his
board
instead
in
he
found
the
foreign
department
and
sent
horsey
back
to
the

to
re
kindle
the

there
on
a
limited
budget
at
the

time
he
sent
other
emissary
to
central

the
follow
year
himself
embark
on
a
three

foreign

this
official

in

he
urgently
confront

with
the

to
act
every

aggravates
the

jones
say
and
the

bug
just
crawl
in
the
solution
accord
to

be
to
give
the

revelation
of

it
be
not
be

now
he
recommend
a
dare
diversification
in
which
the

would
set
up
a

corporation
to
produce
a

under

completely
different
trade
name

to
experiment
with
other
flavor
as
well
ultimately
jones
hop
the
competition
would
be
snuffed
out

eliminate

one

write

four

within
inch
of
your

no
mistake
now
it
be
it
be
coke
the
urge
now
be
to
quaff
the
whole
thing
in
one
gulp
but
if
you
have
the
least
bit
of
the
esthetic
in
you
you
don
t
one
more
sniff
and
deftly
hold
the
bottle
between
thumb
and
two
middle
finger
small

slightly
raise
you
bring

you
don

take
a
full

just
a

he
told

stem
from

there
be

unnecessary
since

the
obvious
choice
after

a
skillful
politician
tough
marketer
and
the
best
speaker

motivator
since
harrison

keough
could
read
from
the

book
and
make
you
cry
as
one
admirer
put
it
goizueta
on
the

hand
a
technical
man
with
no
operating
experience
spoke
in
a
halt
accent
a
curious
amalgam
of
cuba
and
dixie
it
seem
strange
that
a
latin
chemical
engineer
should
run
the
company
that
produce
the
most
american
of
product
insider
like
joe

weren
t
so
surprised
however
only
forty
eight
goizueta
the
consummate
corporate
politician
have
risen
quickly
within
the
company
since
his
arrival
in
atlanta
in
most
important
he
have
grown
very
close
to

goizueta
his
partner
perceive
something
in
the
cuban
that
remind
him
of
himself
when
he
first
take
over
the
company
like
woodruff
goizueta
the
son
of
a
very
wealthy
man
have
establish

outside

goizueta
enjoy
the
attention
of
his

still
sprinkle
with
the
cuban
proverb
he
learn
from
him
in

goizueta
found
another

while
his

to
the

genuine

simplistic
aphorism
remind
him
of
his

acquire

my

it

have
be
it
come
right
out
of
the

the
only
way
i
could
accurately
convey

be
to
memorize
word
by
word
entire
passage
incredibly
by
the
end
of
the
year
he
deliver
the
valedictory

later
he
graduate
tenth
in
his

at
yale

goizueta
as
a
dedicate
impeccably
dress
employee
who
left
a
bare
desk
every
night
never
a

he

an
able
administrator
a

perfectionist
with
an
eye
for

he
knew
where
every
grain
of

be
in
the

a
fellow
worker
recall
goizueta
s
courtly
affable
manner
and
latin
good
look
hid
what
some
call
ruthlessness
but
he
reward
result
and
he
never
assume
an
absolute
position
quote
one
of
his
grandfather
s
proverb
the
quality
of
one
s
compromise
be
much
more
important
than
the
correctness
of
one
s
position
intensely
pragmatic
and
somewhat
cynical
he
once
observe
it
s
a
pretty
good
bet
that
human
being
will
act
in
their
own
self
interest
most
of
the
time
although
goizueta
kept
his
emotion
under
a
steely
logical
control
his
mind
be
like
a
piece
of
crystal
an

the

somewhat
incongruously
the

ask
what
he
would
do
if
he
weren
t
the
head
of
coca
cola
goizueta
give
a
wholly
unexpected
answer
i
d
probably
be
a
good
teacher
in
a

school
what
would
he
assign
not
in

of

other
popular
management
tome
but
the
brother
karamazov
and
the
gospel
of
st
luke
his
answer
reveal
not
only
his
eclectic
reading
but
deep
philosophical
and
religious
concern
nonetheless
the
coca
cola
executive
s
brand
of
religion
do
not
call
for
turn
the
other
cheek
when
ask
for
his
best
characteristic
goizueta
do
not
speak
of
his
devotion
to
god
incisive
mind
intuitive
grasp
or
managerial
expertise
i
m
very
persistent
his
great
fault
he
say
be
impatience
these
two
trait
together
produce
a

with

study
best

beat
pepsi
soundly
if
the
mexican
have
really
propose
any
of
these
silly
name
austin
and
other
coke
executive
wouldn
t
have
be
disturbed
the
whole
point
of
the
project
however
be
to
utilize
the
brand
equity
of
the
coca
cola
name
the
new
product
diet
coke
would
constitute
a
line
extension
to
lend
the
magical
coke
name
to
any
other
soft
drink
be
heretical
when
a
few
dare
company
men
suggest
the
idea
in
when
tab
be
invent
austin
have
condemn
them
for
it
now
tab
held
a
command
lead
over
all
other
diet
drink
why
would
the
company
want
to
cannibalize
its
venerable
drink
with
another
diet
entry
furthermore
wouldn
t
another
product
with
the
coke
name
simply
dilute
the
brand
confuse
consumer
and
contribute
to
already
poor
bottler
morale
zyman
dyson
keough
and
goizueta
be
convince
however
that
the
introduction
of
diet
coke
would
energize
the
business
as
zyman
put
it
in
a
february
memo
to
brian
dyson
over
the
last
few
year
the
company
have
drift
to
a
perceive
image
of
a
traditional
sedentary
conservative
company
the
bold
introduction
of
diet
coke
would
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
this
image
revitalize
the
bottler
and
capitalize
on
the
coca
cola
name
it
would
also
be
profitable
since
a
saccharin
sweeten
drink
wouldn
t
cost
as
much
to
produce
the
timing
be
demographically
perfect
as
well
the
age
baby
boomer
weren
t
drinking
few
cola
drink
as
doomsayers
have
warn
but
be
switch
to
diet
drink
as
part
of
the
emerge
fitness
craze
zyman
conclude
that
competition
cannot
duplicate
this
effort
simply
because
there
already
be
a
diet
pepsi
because
coke
have
held
back
so
long
this
late
bloomer
would
have
an
enormous
catalytic
effect
motivate
bottler
to
go
out
and
really
get
aggressive
in
short
conclude
the
mexican
marketer
this
could
be
the
silver
bullet
then
paul
austin
abruptly
and
inexplicably
pull
the
plug
on

that
a

have
already

introduce
in

you

no
one
object

astonish
at

it
don
t
tell
me
you
re
take
my

away
the

also
reveal
another
disturb
fact
although
many
interviewee
forcefully
assert
that
coca
cola
be
their
favorite
drink
when
ask
what
cola
they
actually
drank
they
waver
coke
sure
but
sometimes
pepsi
or
even
the
generic
store
brand
if
it
be
on

stout
thus
discover
that
while
coca
cola
have
a
place
in
the
heart
it
wasn
t
necessarily
in
the
refrigerator
in
the
fall
of
gianturco
finally
devise
a
new
cola
that
he
assure
zyman
and
stout
would
beat
pepsi
sure
enough
stout
s

test
show
that

prefer
the

enormously
excite

have
work
so
far
and
this
audacious
bold
move
would
prove
coca

s
flexibility
and
leadership
to
any
doubter
at
almost
the
same
moment
scott

be
interview
pepsi
s
dick
alven
for
a
smithsonian
institution
oral
history
of

alven
told
ellsworth
that
the

have
be
completely
halt
but
that
it
s
a
nice
thing
to
have
in
your
arsenal
see
for
them
to
put
that
thing
to
rest
totally
they
would
have
to
do
something
to
their
formula
i
mean
dramatically
and
i
don
t
think
they
re
go
to
do
that
it
s
too
risky
alven
note
that
coca
cola
be
after
all
a
good
product
that
sell
a
lot
of
drink
it
s
kind
of
dangerous
for
them
to
play
with
it
goizueta
who
have
promise
in
that
he
be
willing
to
reformulate
any
or
all
of
our
product
didn
t
question
the
new
recipe
but
he
wasn
t
sure
it
should
replace
the
standard
drink
why
not
call
it
coke
two
or
some
other
name
there
be
multiple
objection
to
that
idea
though
the
product
call
coca
cola
have
to
be
the
best
number
one
it
just
wasn
t
conceivable
to
market
a
well
taste
drink
as
a
competitor
such
a
move
would
also
probably
split
coke
drinker
into
two
small
share
of
the
market
allow
pepsi
to
emerge
as
the
undisputed
leader
nor
could
the
coke
men
alter
the
formula
quietly
consumer
would
notice
an
entirely
different
flavor
complex
and
then
the
company
would
have
to
lie
to
the
public
or
admit
tamper
with
the
world
s
most
famous
secret
formula
clearly
they
must
introduce
the
new
flavor
with
great
fanfare
aside
from
these
consideration
the
company
never
publicly
acknowledge
another
underlie
motivation
to
replace
the
old
formula
new
coke
would
contain
no

the

their

consequently
coca

mount
feeble

the

then
you
take
them

it
be
easy
to

why
goizueta
be
alarmed
in

neither

goizueta
insist

a

bottom
line
credo
the

of

to
create

for
its

he
get
his
psychic
income
from
the
impact
he
have
not
only
on
his
company
but
on
society
as
a
whole
when
i
be
in
eastern
europe
goizueta
explain
i
saw
people
who
for
the

get
paid
real

they

they
really
be
thank
the
coca

company
he
espouse
a
strict
laissez

philosophy
it
puzzle
me
that
many
american
want
our
government
to
fix
our
economy
or
even
protect
our
job
when
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
be
thrill
to
have
government
finally
play
its
appropriate
role
he
explain
that
he
knew
the
peril
of
a
socialist
system
firsthand
it
s
the
reason
i
come
to
this
country
from
cuba
goizueta
argue
that
by
boost
the

price
he
have
do
more
good
than
any
number
of

in

create
nearly

dollar
in
additional
wealth
for
nonprofit
organization
hold
coke

he
emphasize
however
that
such
gain
should
not
come
at
the
expense
of
employee
he
lament
the
downsize
trend
in
which
corporation
laid
off
thousand
of
loyal
employee
i
be
against
a
scorch
earth
adherence
to
profit
at
all
cost
such
shortsighted
policy
would
inevitably

prove
to
be
a
workmanlike
business
narrative
his
unique
gift
as
an
executive
greising
write
be
his
ability
to
change
his
own
formula
to
quickly
understand
his
mistake
adapt
and
ultimately
triumph
but
reader
learn
little
of
the
leader
s
inner
life
perhaps
when
you
knew
his
devotion
to
his
family
and
product
you
knew
goizueta
for
all
his
aloof
grandeur
however
the
business
giant
sometimes
show
a
softer
side
picture
of
the
ceo
with
child
at
the

him
grin

goizueta
rarely
spoke
about
his
past
insist
that
he
prefer
to
look
forward
but
he
never
forgot
the
day
he
flee
castro
s
cuba
in
with
forty
dollar
and
one
hundred
share
of

on

goizueta
address
a
group
of
immigrant
who
have
just
take
the
oath
of
american
citizenship
for
me
look
into
your
eye
this
morning
be
like
look
into
a
mirror
he
say
then
wonder
aloud
at
his
own
good
fortune
that
a
young
immigrant
could
come
to
this
country
be
give
a
chance
to
work
hard
and
apply
his
skill
and
ultimately
earn
the
opportunity
to
lead
not
only
a
large
corporation
but
an
institution
that
actually
symbolizes
the
very
essence
of
america
and
american
ideal
he
also
reveal
how
he
get
there
you
must
sense
the
opportunity
in
your
nostril
with
every
breath
and
you
must
see
it
in
your
dream
when
you
be
asleep
perhaps
as
he
be
laid
to
his
eternal
rest
roberto
goizueta
still
dream
of
coca

one
of
nelson
mandela
s
old

be
richard
maponya
an
elder
statesman
of

maponya
own
a

undoubtedly
maponya
help
persuade
mandela
to

to
see
that
what
be
hold
us
back
now

not

coca

there

of
bureaucratese
say
that
the

be
take
all
necessary
step
to
ensure
its

the

day
ivester
flew

to
exercise
personal
damage

he
pen
an
apology
that
ran
in
full

in

he

in
a
ninety

a
free

even

halt
to
this
restore

violate

finally
by

both
belgium
and

have
rescind
their
ban
though
coke
still
have
to
destroy
its
survive
stock
before
it
could
gear
up
again
the
massive
recall
cost
the
company
and
its
major
bottler
over
million
not
to
mention
a
severely
tarnished
image
just
as
the
belgian
crisis
be
finally
wind
down
the
french
medium
publicize
rumor
that
rat
poison
have
somehow
contaminate

then
a
polish
consumer
found
some
mold
in
bonaqa
coke
s
european
bottle
water
the
mold
be
not
a
health
problem
but
some
reusable

hadn
t
be
properly
clean
as
a
result
coke
spent
another
million
to
withdraw

destroy
the
product
yet
in
all
these
incident
coke
probably
didn
t
make
anyone
sick
as
every
scientist
who
study
the
belgian
scare
conclude
perhaps
there
be
an
off
odor
even
that
much
be
unclear
but
nothing
to
account
for
the
panic
the
nausea
the
dizziness
those
be
the
classic
vague
symptom
of
psychosomatic
illness
coke
found
itself
embroil
in

victim
than
a

that

bashers
love
to
vilify
it
be
because
of
coke
s
size
ubiquity
power
and
popularity
that
the
rumor
spread
so
quickly
the
medium
report
it
with
insufficient
explanation
and
a
great
deal
of
sensationalism
and
credulity
caught
in
a
catch

coke

no
choice
but
to

in

then
heyer
basically
take
over

it

find
two
can
of

in

refrigerator
he
gulp
down
one
of
them
then
us
the

to
cool
himself
rub
it
on
his

inside
his

under

after

he
give
it

don

thought
the

represent
everything
that

with
recent

ad
it
be
jarring
and
negative
though
he
have
applaud
heyer
when
he
arrive
at

keough
be
have
second
thought
he
have
also
heard
about
heyer
s
temper
castigate
somebody
publicly
it
s
obscene
in
my
view
keough
told
a

that
april

by
late

the

have
settle
on

the

ran
an

full
of

call
him
a

when
the

want

move

atlanta
bob
nardelli

steve

also

then
it
look

jack

take

we

not

there

no

that
would
turn

around
the

dipped

isdell
later
admit
there
be
legitimate
concern
that
if
the

price
drop
too
low
the

could
be
a
takeover
target
either

no
rosy

well
execution
around

lament
another

for
the

he
put
it
the
next

he
open
up
the

one

why

when
we
can
t
seem
to
figure
out
how
to

isdell
ask
or
do
we
need
to
buy
another

because
we
can
t
over
four
hundred

employee
take
part
in
this
intensive
self
assessment
which
ultimately
produce
a
large

pamphlet
entitle
our

for
growth
a
kind
of
capitalist
reverse
spin
of
the
marx
engels
communist
manifesto
in
recent
year
we
ve
lack
a
clear
direction
and
a
common
understand
of
our
purpose
as
a
company
it
begin
we
ve
dealt
with
challenge
reactively
and
separately
not
as
a

we
ve
be
too
focus
on
the
short
term
the
pamphlet
contain
no
startle
innovation

plenty
of
hackneyed
aphorism
accountability
if
it

it
s
up
to
me
for

the

vague
on

but
at

it
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
problem

coke

say
well
that
s
not
too
good
for
us
and
it
occur
to
me
that
any
major
world
event
would
have
an
impact
on
coca

but
that
none
would
really
impede

advance
for

though
company
men
have
be
work
closely
with

they
soon

struck

no

jacobson
observe

that
a
subtle
transformation
have
take

within
my

a

his

flow

he
have

though
he
never
try

convert
me
i
knew
he
practice
a

that
i
continue
to
find
somewhat
amuse
somewhat
alarm
and
ultimately
mystify
he
have
become
a
coca

man

i
must
add
a
cautionary
note
when
he
learn
i
be
work
on
a
new
edition
another
former

man
lament
i
m
not
sure
whether
the
title
of
your
book
still
make
sense
as
it
absolutely
do
year
ago
for
many
reason
i
don
t
think
there
be
nearly
as
many
coca
cola
men
or
woman
as
there
be
two
decade
ago
i
fear
that
he
be
correct

be
no
longer

high
call
that
it

come
to
work
for
coke
for
a
while
merely
as
a
step
stone
in
a
career
but
much
of
the
magic
and
of
the
religion
remains
at
least
more
than
with
most
corporation
for
this
edition
i
interviewed
a
former
coke
marketer
whose
job
be
cut
in
one
of
the
purge
of
the
early
twenty
first
century
he
remain
somewhat
bitter
but
he
obviously
love
talk
about
coca
cola
and
when
i
comment
on
that
he
pause
for
a
moment
then
say
it
s
funny
but
it
sort
of
get
in
your
blood
