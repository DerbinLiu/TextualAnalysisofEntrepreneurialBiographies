can	5.62
the	4.98

be	5.68
part	4.98
of	4.94
the	4.98
solution	6.84
probably	5.64
they	5.62
try	6.02
they	5.62
provide	6.4
the	4.98
bank	5.92
with	5.72
capital	5.92
and	5.22
credit	5.86
that	4.94
the	4.98

the	4.98

don	4.98
t	4.84
pas	5.12
it	5.02

so	5.08
it	5.02
be	5.68
only	4.92

of	4.94
the	4.98
