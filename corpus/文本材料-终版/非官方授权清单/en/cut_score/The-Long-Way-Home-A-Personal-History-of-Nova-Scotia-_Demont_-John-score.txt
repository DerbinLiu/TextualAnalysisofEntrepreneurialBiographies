year	5.38
before	5.1
i	5.92
attend	6.0

so	5.08
it	5.02
be	5.68

that	4.94
by	4.98
then	5.34
i	5.92
d	4.72
never	3.34
actually	5.3
be	5.68

therefore	5.08
could	5.52

that	4.94
from	5.18

remember	6.42
what	4.8
i	5.92
do	5.76

feel	5.9
that	4.94
half	4.6
a	5.24
century	5.78
later	4.6
i	5.92
recognize	6.08
as	5.22
the	4.98
ache	2.68
of	4.94
nostalgia	-1
even	5.58
though	4.78
at	4.9
such	5.16
an	4.84
age	4.88
i	5.92
have	5.82
nothing	3.9
to	4.98
be	5.68
really	5.84
nostalgic	-1
about	5.16
the	4.98
sensation	6.68
cannot	3.32
have	5.82
last	3.74
long	4.74
there	5.1
be	5.68
a	5.24
noise	3.74
i	5.92
turn	5.2
i	5.92
m	5.06
sure	6.32
without	3.54
look	5.54
and	5.22
hightail	-1
it	5.02
run	5.48
as	5.22
fast	6.44
as	5.22
i	5.92
could	5.52
stay	5.56

block	4.02
but	4.24
seem	5.24

so	5.08
much	5.74
farther	5.14
i	5.92
have	5.82
no	3.48

whether	4.92
i	5.92
just	5.76

it	5.02
now	5.9
it	5.02
all	6.22

then	5.34
i	5.92
have	5.82

long	4.74
as	5.22
i	5.92
remember	6.42
even	5.58
though	4.78
after	5.08
all	6.22
this	5.06

i	5.92
still	5.14
struggle	3.4

explain	5.46
what	4.8
exactly	6.0
i	5.92
