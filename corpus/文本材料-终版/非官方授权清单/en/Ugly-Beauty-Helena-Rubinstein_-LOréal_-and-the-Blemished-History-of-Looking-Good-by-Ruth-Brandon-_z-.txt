Introduction

			Everyone has heard of Helena Rubinstein, international queen of cosmetics. Tiny, plump, spike-heeled, bowler hatted, and extravagantly jeweled, she was for many years one of the fixtures of the New York scene, scurrying between her vast apartment on Park Avenue and her salon on Fifth Avenue at Fifty-seventh Street, in one hand an enormous leather bag stuffed with cash, business notes, old tissues, and spare earrings, in the other a paper sack containing a copious lunch. Instantly recognizable to all from the photographs that adorned her advertisements, she was energy personified, at once comic and awe inspiring.

			Few, by contrast, have heard of Eugène Schueller—though everyone knows L’Oréal, the firm he founded in Paris in 1909. Like Rubinstein he was born poor; like her, he rode to riches on the back of women’s compulsion to beautify themselves. Unlike her, however, neither his name nor his face were familiar to those who bought his hair dyes. Immured within his empire, traveling between factories in the Rolls that was his office on wheels, he shunned personal publicity. So removed was he from society, indeed, that when his wife died and he wished to remarry, the only woman he could find, though he was by then one of the richest men in France, was his daughter’s governess.

			In 1988, Schueller’s business swallowed Rubinstein’s. In the normal way of things the takeover would have gone unnoticed except in the business press. But Rubinstein was a Jew, while Schueller, during the German Occupation, had been a leading fascist collaborator. And although they never met during their lifetimes, and both, by then, were long dead, the consequences of this potentially lethal opposition outlived them. The conjunction led to a series of scandals that not only threw a new and sinister light on L’Oréal but threatened the reputations of some of France’s most powerful men—up to and including its president himself.

			It may seem odd—certainly unexpected—that a history of the beauty business should include an excursion into fascist politics. But cosmetics, unlike clothes, have always been a political hot potato. The stories of Helena Rubinstein and Eugène Schueller show us why this has been so—and continues to be so today.

				Beauty Is Power!1




I

				Her life,” 					said Vogue of Helena Rubinstein, “reads like a fairy 						story.”1 It was 1915: Madame (as she was 					always known) had just opened her first New York salon. Dark-blue velvet covered 					the walls of its main room, with rose-colored woodwork and sculptures by Elie 					Nadelman from Madame’s own art collection. Each of the many other rooms had its 					own decorative theme, from a Louis XVI salon to a Chinese fantasy in black and 					gold and scarlet. The diminutive proprietor, high heels adding a few needed 					inches to the mere four foot ten nature had allowed her, personally showed the 					journalists around. However busy she might be, there was always time for 					journalists. Madame, ever keen to pinch a penny where she could, knew no amount 					of advertising could equal the boost afforded by a really long interview, with 					photos, spread over several pages. And such a piece cost nothing at all.

				The fairy story in question was a classic 					rags-to-riches tale. Twelve years earlier, in 1903, Helena Rubinstein, a poor 					emigrant from Poland, had opened her first beauty salon: a single room in 					Melbourne, Australia, from which she sold pots of homemade face cream. So great 					were her marketing skills, such the demand, and so enormous the markup, that 					within two years she was rich. By 1915 she was a millionaire. She had dazzled 					London and Paris, and was set to do the same in America.

				Fairy stories, however, are more than just dazzling 					social leaps. They are also dramatizations of our deepest dreams. And in this 					sense, too, the metaphor was apposite, both for Rubinstein and for her chosen 					industry. For cosmetics are all about dreams—specifically, the dream of an 					ideal, time-defying physical self.

				Generally speaking, the public acceptance of 					women’s cosmetics has varied according to the social status of their sex. When 					the Roman poet Ovid, in his Ars amatoria, advised 					women to make sure their armpits didn’t smell, that their legs were shaved, to 					keep their teeth white, to “acquire whiteness with a layer of powder,” to rouge 					if they were naturally pale, “hide your natural cheeks with little patches,” and 					“highlight your eyes with thinned ashes,” he was speaking to a society where 					women had substantial social freedoms in all spheres other than politics. 					Equally, the heroine of Pope’s Rape of the Lock, 					with its famous dressing-table scene enumerating “Puffs, Powders, Patches, 					Bibles, Billet-doux,” was free to take her place as an active player on the 					social stage. But in societies where a wife’s functions are solely to produce 					children and service her husband, cosmetics are taboo. Saint Paul inveighs 					against them; the Talmud declares that “a beautiful wife—beautiful without 					cosmetics—doubles the days of her husband and increases his mental 						comfort.”2

				The nineteenth century, particularly in Britain, 					was just such a society: in the words of social commentator William Rathbone 					Greg, writing in 1862, a woman’s function in it was to “complete, sweeten, and 					embellish the existence of others.”3 But Helena 					Rubinstein’s good fortune, after a century of repression during which no 					respectable lady could allow herself even a touch of rouge, was to hit a moment 					when women were poised to claim new freedoms. Her fairy-tale riches—rubies, 					emeralds, pearls, and diamonds that would not have looked out of place in Ali 					Baba’s cave, sculptures and paintings, apartments and houses in New York, 					London, Paris, and the Riviera—reflected, in the reassuringly solid form Madame 					always favored, this surge of empowerment. And since empowerment is the keynote, 					too, of her own personal story, nothing could be more appropriate than that the 					first woman tycoon—the first self-made female millionaire—should have amassed 					her fortune through cosmetics.

				Rubinstein’s life, as recounted by herself in two 					memoirs, was a fairy tale in yet another sense: a desirable fiction that had 					little to do with reality. “I have always felt a woman has the right to treat 					the subject of her age with ambiguity until, perhaps, she passes into the realm 					of over ninety,” she wrote—she herself being, by then, well into that realm. And 					ambiguous she was, and remained, not just about her age but about every aspect 					of her life. Although in the year of her death she finally acknowledged she was 					born “in the early 1870s, on Christmas Day” (the year was in fact 1872), even 					then she maintained the story—repeated so often she had perhaps come to believe 					it—that the family had been well-off. They lived, she said, in a big house near 					the Rynek, the ancient and splendid market square that is Krakow’s city center; 					her father, a “wholesale food broker,” was an intellectual who collected books 					and fine furniture; she herself had attended a gymnasium, she had for two years 					been a medical student, and her sisters, too, had attended university.4

				In fact anyone could tell that Helena had been 					poor, and hated it, from the extreme pleasure she took in being rich, piling up 					the bright, shiny goodies with a compulsive delight that never dimmed and that 					no one born rich could ever experience.

				Similarly, it is clear she would have studied 					medicine if she could. She always projected herself as a qualified scientific 					professional, was constantly photographed in white lab coats amid test tubes and 					Bunsen burners, emphasized her products’quasi-medical aspects. She became as 					knowledgeable in her field as anyone alive. But that field was far from 					scientific, and such knowledge as she possessed was laboriously gleaned over the 					years, not formally acquired.

				The Rubinsteins actually lived in Kazimierz, 					Krakow’s Jewish ghetto, whose cramped streets, despite restoration as a tourist 					attraction by the wealthy descendants of the poor Jews who once lived there, 					still exude a dingy poverty. There, Naftali Herzl Rubinstein, Helena’s father, 					was a kerosene dealer, occasionally selling eggs in the market. His eldest 					daughter, Chaja, who would become known as Helena, attended a local Jewish 					school.

				She was, like many firstborn children, ambitious 					and high-achieving, and as the eldest of eight sisters acquired a precociously 					adult habit of responsibility. When she recounts that her father, “since he had 					no son . . . fell into the habit of talking over his plans and 					projects with me,”5 there is, for once, no 					reason to doubt her. Many Jewish wives kept the family going by managing a 					business as well as running a home and raising children, providing the material 					necessities while their menfolk lived the life of the mind. Yiddish has a 					special word—baleboosteh—for this combination of 					worldly competence and efficient domesticity, and this, clearly, was clever 					Chaja’s destiny. For a poor girl from her orthodox background (her mother’s 					father was a rabbi), medical school could never have been anything but a dream. 					A girl’s career was marriage. Any activities preceding that were mere 					time-marking. Afterwards, if her mother’s example was anything to go by, she 					could expect more or less permanent pregnancy: a cramped and frantic life amid 					an ever-increasing brood of babies.

				It was enough to put any intelligent girl off 					marriage and motherhood for life, and (judging by her later forays into those 					territories) this was just the effect it had on Chaja. It can be no coincidence 					that the only Krakow suitor she mentions with enthusiasm was not a possible 					prospect, as he was not a Jew. Coming from a family like the Rubinsteins, to 					marry “out” would have been equivalent to death. Had Chaja done so, they would 					have cut off all contact with her and recited funeral prayers. Instead, her 					father produced a suitable widower. Chaja refused him, there was an almighty 					row, and she left the family home, never to return. She took refuge in Vienna 					with an aunt, her mother’s sister. It was her life’s defining moment. From now 					on she would be Helena, and her own woman.

				Everything that happened to her subsequently, 					everything she did, stemmed from this furious decision. It not only reflected 					her attitude toward the prescribed female life of marriage and motherhood, but 					would influence her view of what cosmetics were for and what they might do for 					the wearer. No one was ever less interested in politics, whether of the 					international or the gender variety, than Helena Rubinstein—on the contrary, 					throughout her life, until it became impossible, she would shun, in every 					possible way, the political arena. But this one act catapulted her into it from 					the outset.

				Her Vienna relations, the Splitters, were 					prosperous furriers. (A photo exists, taken in Vienna, of Helena, aged 					twenty-one, looking matronly in astrakhan.) Frau Splitter continued, on her 					sister’s behalf, the hunt for a suitable husband. But Helena refused all comers. 					And since Europe offered no obvious prospects, she decided to move on to a new 					continent. Three of her mother’s Silberfeld brothers had settled in Australia. 					John was a jeweler in Melbourne; Bernhard and Louis, along with Louis’s daughter 					Eva, a cousin about Helena’s age who was married with two small children, kept a 					general store and a grocery in Coleraine, a small town two hundred miles to the 					west. The Coleraine family were in need of some extra help, and in the summer of 					1896 Helena sailed from Genoa to join them.

				Nothing in Europe could have prepared her for the 					rude life of an Australian small town. She did not get on with her Uncle Louis, 					who, she hinted in a memoir, made unwelcome advances, and her cousin Eva’s 					marriage was disastrously unhappy. But, speaking no English, she could 					communicate with no one else: she was stuck with them. In later years Helena 					conducted her enormous correspondence (even when writing to her sisters) in 					English, the language of her adult life. But until her arrival in Australia she 					had spoken only Yiddish and Polish. Her spoken English always remained heavily 					accented, resounding with Yiddishisms. She described herself as shy, a quality 					hard to reconcile with her singularly uninhibited approach to business and her 					constant entertaining. The difficulty, however, seems largely to have arisen 					from her awkwardness in English. “She uttered in grunts,” fashion writer 					Ernestine Carter recalled6—a strange mix of 					English, French, Polish, and Yiddish that made her hard to follow and reluctant 					to strike up conversation with strangers. Surrounding herself with family as she 					famously did, calling in sister after sister, cousins, nephews, nieces, as the 					business expanded, she carried her homeland with her, whether to New York, 					Paris, or London: the archetypical rootless cosmopolitan.

				She endured Coleraine for three years. Then, having 					picked up enough English to operate independently, she decided it was time to 					make her escape. Revisiting Australia in 1958, she refused to set foot in 					Coleraine. “No! No! I don’t want to go back there,” she told Patrick O’Higgins, 					the aide and companion of her later years. “For what? I was hungry, lonely, poor 					in that awful place.”7 But the Coleraine years 					had not been wasted. She knew now that she wanted to start up a business, and 					knew, too, what that business would be. One reason she was so convincing a 					beauty counselor was that her exquisite complexion meant she did for a long time 					look much younger than her real age. This was unusual in Australia, whose harsh 					climate, with its strong winds and baking sun, is hard on the skin. Her 					weather-beaten neighbors were admiring. What was her secret?

				Helena claimed to have begun by selling her own 					spare pots of face cream to the local ladies, telling them that she used a 					formula discovered by some brothers called Lykusky “who had supplied us with it 					for our personal use ever since I was a little girl.” When the supply was 					exhausted, the legend went, she sent off to Poland to replenish her supplies. 					This was, on every level, a fantasy. The voyage between Europe and Australia 					took forty-five days—far too slow if orders had to be fulfilled—and it is 					unlikely that her own initial supplies would have provided any surplus. But for 					a natural entrepreneur like Helena, her neighbors’ interest was enough to plant 					an idea—the idea she had been looking for ever since abandoning her father’s 					house and the narrow life it offered. She would start a business selling face 					cream.

				This chance direction was Helena’s first great 					stroke of luck. In all other areas of commerce, women were at a disadvantage, 					but the beauty business was different. With odd exceptions, such as the French 					court of Louis XV, where everyone, male and female, whitened their faces (as a 					sign that they did not lead a lower-class outdoor life) and rouged their cheeks 					and lips, the misogynistic Christian world had frowned upon cosmetics even where 					(as in Restoration England) they were widely used. Even when everyone knew that 					women did use rice powder, or face cream, or rouge, or whitened their skins with 					the notorious and poisonous ceruse, made from white lead, these preparations 					still had to be obtained discreetly and applied in strict privacy. Men averted 					their eyes from such arrangements—and so failed to realize what was obvious to 					Helena Rubinstein: that half the human race was interested in what she had to 					sell. Indeed, long after Helena Rubinstein, Elizabeth Arden, and Estée Lauder 					had all made millions out of cosmetics, men remained noticeably absent from the 					beauty business. There was Max Factor, but his main specialty was stage makeup, 					although he did introduce a line of cosmetics to the public in 1920. Otherwise, 					until the arrival of Charles Revson’s Revlon in the 1950s, women entrepreneurs 					dominated the beauty scene. This was partly because, as Life magazine observed in 1941, “Most men do not find an atmosphere 					conducive to their best work in the tight little matriarchy of the beauty 						business”8—a business Madame described in 					1920 as “working for women with women, and giving that which only women can 					give—an intimate understanding of feminine needs and feminine desires.”9 But the prospect of enormous profits is 					generally enough to overcome any squeamishness or uncertainty. What gave women 					the edge in the beauty industry was that, in the beginning at least, this was a 					huge potential market of which only women were 					aware.

				Helena decided to start her business in Melbourne. 					It was a large city (in 1901 it already had over 500,000 inhabitants), and her 					uncle John was established there. And—in her second stroke of luck—it proved to 					be an uniquely propitious location for what she now proposed. Whether or not 					Australian men disapproved of makeup was of little interest to Australian 					women—for unlike Europeans, they did not depend on men for their money. In 					Europe in 1901, respectable women only worked if they had no other means of 					support. Possible jobs were still effectively limited to dressmaking, millinery, 					and teaching, either as governesses or in schools. Australia, too, had its 					dressmakers, milliners, and governesses. But Australian women also worked in 					other fields, as journalists, telephone switchboard operators, and secretaries, 					in shops and hotels, in small factories . . . Around 35 percent of 					Melbourne’s breadwinners were women, and 40 percent of working-age women were in 					paid employment. The Melbourne Age coined the phrase 					“bachelor girls” to describe the young women who, like Helena herself, arrived 					in the city looking for work—and who constituted an instant customer base. Their 					wages might be small—the average female wage was only half what men could expect 					to earn—but this was, nonetheless, their own money, to spend as they 						pleased.10

				Unsurprisingly, the beauty-cream business was not a 					wholly unplowed field. Before the rise of commercial products, most women made 					their own simple cosmetics. And the fact that this was a familiar domestic 					craft, with cheap raw materials, made it a tempting, and unintimidating, female 					business proposition.2 Recipes were available in printed 					compilations in the same way as food recipes, and often using the same 					ingredients. Skin creams, for example, were made from an emulsion of fat and 					water, perfumed with scented plant extracts. Women used whatever fat was to 					hand: milk or cream, goose grease, calf’s foot jelly, almond oil, egg yolks. 					(The egg whites, mixed with lemon juice, could be used to make an astringent 					face mask.) As it happened, Australia abounded in a particularly suitable fat: 					this was sheep country, and lanolin, a by-product of sheep’s wool, is both cheap 					and good for the skin. And lots of ladies advertised in the Melbourne papers, 					offering various treatments for the skin and hair.

				The existing Melbourne enterprises, however, were 					mostly semi-amateur and hand-to-mouth—not at all the kind of business Helena had 					in mind. But proper business start-ups need capital, and in Australia, as 					throughout the British Empire, no woman could take out a bank loan under her own 					name. To start a serious business meant finding someone to underwrite her.

				In her unreliable memoir, written sixty years 					later, Helena identified her Maecenas as a Miss Helen Macdonald, a friend she 					had made on board ship when she came to Australia, “far from wealthy, but she 					insisted upon lending me part of her life savings, the two hundred and fifty 					pounds I would need to start my venture.”11 In 					fact no such person appears on the relevant passenger list. In another account, 					she suggested that a Coleraine friend come with her to Melbourne and take a half 					share in the business. The offer was declined—surely one of the worst business 					decisions in history—but perhaps it was this friend who contributed the 						money.12 Whatever its provenance, the £250 					was forthcoming. It was the only money Helena Rubinstein ever borrowed. Now all 					that remained was to create a product and sell it.

				The first thing was to learn, if she did not 					already know it, the simple knack of making face cream by emulsifying lanolin 					and adding essential plant oils to disguise its unpleasant sheepy smell. Some 					years later she would instruct her London manageress in this process, with a 					recipe for making blackhead cream:

				Take one pint of oil, 						put it into a white basin and take four pints of peroxyde 6 percent and add 						to the oil or rather the foundation. But you must do it very slowly. You 						will spoil it if you put in much at a time. You just add a little by little 						to the oil and stir the whole time. Stir with a knife. The less peroxyde you 						put in at a time the better and thicker it will get. Add a little rose 						geranium, to perfume. Also mix.

				Essential oils were expensive—violet perfume cost 					£25,000 a kilo, “more expensive than diamonds and pearls,” but a little went a 					long way.13

				Anyone who has made mayonnaise will recognize the 					method—and indeed, Helena Rubinstein always referred to her workbench as her 					“kitchen.” She adored preparing creams and lotions, and her “kitchen” remained 					the place she was always happiest. Many years later, when she met her fellow 					Pole Marie Curie, who had isolated radium by boiling down ton upon ton of 					pitchblende in a drafty old shed, she startled the distinctly un-domestic Madame 					Curie by asking what her “cuisine” was like.

				With some of the £250 she rented a large, bright 					room in Melbourne’s city center, painted it white, adorned it with curtains made 					from the unused evening gowns she had brought from Europe, made up some stock, 					painted a sign announcing “Helena Rubinstein—Beauty Salon,” and opened for 					business. She started out with just one all-purpose face cream, “Crème 					Valaze.”

				“VALAZE” BY DR LYKUSKI, 						the most celebrated European Skin Specialist, is the best nourisher of the 						skin. “VALAZE” will improve the worst of skin in one month. 3/6d. and 5/6d. 						If posted, 6d. extra.3 Available from Helena Rubinstein 						and company.14

				Valaze, “of exceptional value to those who are 					disfigured with freckles, sun-burn, wrinkles, eczema, blackheads or 					skin-blemishes of any kind,” would remain a central Rubinstein product for the 					next fifty years.

				Although her advertisements emphasized the cream’s 					exotic provenance, specially imported from Poland and “compounded from rare 					herbs which only grow in the Carpathian Mountains,” this description was pure 					snake oil. Importing someone else’s skin cream from Europe to Australia would 					not just be grindingly slow, it would eat disastrously into the markup. Lots of 					factors made Helena Rubinstein rich—intelligence, astuteness, hard work, lucky 					timing. But what made her (and her competitors) so very rich, so fast, was the 					markup: the difference between cheap raw ingredients and the astounding prices 					charged for the finished product. A few months before her death, Madame found 					the original Valaze formula among a heap of old papers in the cellar of her 					Paris home: it contained only such common raw materials as ceresine wax, mineral 					oil, and sesame.15 Psychologically, however, 					“rare Carpathian herbs” were essential. Then, as now, the beauty industry’s real 					product was magic; and when it came to transforming perfumed fats into magic 					vials, boring old rose oil or pine-bark extract could never compete with rare 					Carpathian herbs.

				This was Australia’s first proper beauty salon, and 					it aroused enormous curiosity. “People streamed in,” Rubinstein remembered. “The 					majority stayed for advice, and few left without a jar of my hand-labelled 						cream.”16 This was no small purchase. A 					milliner earned around £2 a week, a barmaid £1, a dressmaker £3: a pot of Valaze 					therefore consumed a good proportion of a week’s wages. However, one of Helena 					Rubinstein’s early discoveries was that in the beauty business, high prices do 					not deter sales. On the contrary—if one of her lines failed to sell, Madame 					would raise the price, and sales would miraculously increase.4

				Even as she struggled to keep up with the demand of 					the walk-in trade, Rubinstein was inundated with mail orders—many of them 					spurred by an article about the salon in a Sydney newspaper. Newspaper articles 					were not only free, they were more effective than any number of expensive 					advertisements. From then on, Rubinstein made it her business to court the 					press. She studied beauty editors’ personal preferences, and in later years, 					when she was due to meet one, always made sure to wear some dispensable item of 					jewelery—a ring, a bracelet—that she could press upon them as a parting gift. 					Now she wrote to each customer offering to return their money if they weren’t 					prepared to wait. She had placed a new order with Dr. Lykusky, but it would not 					arrive for a while. Only one customer asked for her money back. After days and 					nights of feverish work in the “kitchen,” preparing the cream and packing the 					jars, Miss Rubinstein announced that her stock was replenished, and filled the 					orders.

				She worked eighteen-hour days, and (as she told it 					sixty years later) “lost many a beau, and missed the fun of being young.” The 					truth was that being young had not been fun—and that work was. “Work has been my 					best beauty treatment!” she wrote at the end of her life. “It keeps the wrinkles 					out of the mind and the spirit. It helps to keep a woman young. It certainly 					keeps a woman alive!”17 It interested her more 					than any man ever did. She could never keep a boyfriend for long, Helena 					recounted of those Melbourne days. Hoping for a night out, they found themselves 					hefting vats of cream, filling jars, or sticking labels. Even when she met 					Edward Titus and fell in love—even after they had children—work came first.

				The business grew with extraordinary speed. After 					two years, the original £250 debit had become a credit of £12,000, and larger 					premises were urgently needed. Helena took a seven-room suite in a new building 					a little way down the street and began to train up a small staff. Her 					advertising philosophy was simple: “Fear copy with a bit of blah-blah.” Until 					now women had just had skin, but now they had different varieties of skin: oily, 					dry, or normal. This distinction sowed profitable uncertainty among her 					clientele, who demanded, and happily bought, different creams—moisturizing, 					astringent, bleaching—to combat their newly defined deficiencies. It was a 					brilliant move. Later, in a similar brainstorm, Helena rebranded and promoted 					her existing range of creams and lotions as suitable for particular hours of the 					day or night, making them “Wake-Up Creams,” or “Night Creams.” An investigation 					of cosmetics, conducted by the left-wing pressure group Consumer Research in the 					1930s, quoted a trade journal that observed: “From a merchandising point of view 					every manufacturer should . . . avoid ‘all purpose’ claims, because, 					even though they could be in part substantiated, it is better to sell a woman 					four different creams for four different purposes than one cream for all 						purposes.”18

				A lesser woman might have been satisfied with this 					unheard-of success. But Helena Rubinstein’s secret weapon, the one that set her 					furthest apart from the small-time habitués of the small ads, was her utter 					imperviousness to satisfaction. She always needed to move on. And at this point, 					that would require actual knowledge—dermatological, dietary, even surgical—not 					available in Australia. In the summer of 1905, confident that the business was 					established enough to survive her brief absence, she embarked for Europe, and a 					crash course in the science of beauty.

				Her 					first stop was Krakow. For ten years she had bathed its memory in the rosy glow 					of homesickness. The reality, inevitably, was anticlimactic, but also 					liberating. “The old town had not moved a pace in my absence. To me who had 					changed so much in a short while, it seemed indeed to have moved backwards, and 					to be a bit alien. . . . Home was not the same to me and from that 					time on I felt my life was in my own hands.”19 					Cutting short her visit (she would not see her parents again), she set out on a 					whirlwind tour of Europe’s skin-care specialists, working, as was her habit, day 					and night, so as not to waste a second of her limited time in Europe. In Paris, 					where she stayed with her sister Pauline Hirschberg (who would eventually take 					charge of the Helena Rubinstein Paris salon), she studied dermatology, learning 					“[the skin’s] intricate anatomy and the principles which govern its appearance 					and health.” In Wiesbaden she became acquainted with the then highly 					experimental science of facial surgery, and learned about metabolism and diet 					and their relation to health and beauty. In Vienna she met a woman doctor, Frau 					Doktor Emmy List, who became a good friend and would later come to work for her 					in London.

				Here, at last, was the education she had dreamed of 					as a girl, albeit in a telescoped version. Described in My 						Life for Beauty as “I think the most stimulating years of my 						life,”20 this period in fact lasted two or 					three months at most. She left Australia in June and returned in September. But 					for Madame, time was relative. In her later publicity she knocked a decade off 					her age, simply losing the years in which nothing had happened, and in the same 					way she extended these life-changing months into the years they psychologically 					represented. When she told an American interviewer, in 1922, that she “studied 					medicine in Germany,” that (for a week or two) was what she did. The trip to 					Krakow had disposed, finally and forever, of the Kazimierz daughter; Wiesbaden, 					Vienna, Paris, Berlin, legitimized the businesswoman. She was no longer in any 					doubt “that my choice had been right—that this work I had chosen was infinitely 					preferable to any marriage which my aunt might have destined for me.”21

				When the time came to return to Australia, she did 					not travel alone, but took with her Ceska, the third-youngest of her sisters, 					and a cousin, Lola. All but one of the eight Rubinstein sisters would end up 					working for Helena’s company, as would an assortment of cousins. This can be 					seen as an act of generosity—having discovered the pleasures of the 					self-sufficient working life, she wanted to extend them to her family. When 					fashion editor Ernestine Carter, having met the London and Paris Rubinstein 					sisters, congratulated Madame on her clever family, “she focussed her black gaze 					on me. ‘Better they work,’ she said.”22 But 					family also staved off loneliness. Later, when she became rich, she constantly 					entertained the famous personalities she encountered in her working life and 					through her interest in art and fashion. But that was business rather than 					pleasure, part of the public persona around which the entire Helena Rubinstein 					operation revolved. For relaxation she relied on her sisters, and endless games 					of cards.

				She opened more salons, and devised a range of 					wonderful new products: Novena Poudre, a face powder for dry and normal skin; 					Valaze Herbal Powder for oily skins; Dr. Lykusky’s Valaze Blackhead and 					Open-Pore Paste; Valaze Red Nose Ointment and Powder; Valaze Liquidine 					. . . “Money flowed in, in a continuous stream,” she recalled in her 					first memoir, The Art of Feminine Beauty. “It seemed 					the whole Australian continent—or, at least, its feminine half—was bent on 						beautification.”23

				But her visit to Europe had expanded her ambitions. 					If Krakow had been a backwater, neither was Australia the center of the 					universe. Europe called, and only one thing held her back: a new acquaintance, 					Edward Titus.

				Titus was a Polish Jew who had known Helena’s 					sisters in Krakow. He had emigrated to America, become a journalist there, and 					acquired American nationality; now he was traveling around Australia. Arriving 					in Melbourne, he called in at the salon. For the first and last time in her 					life, Helena fell in love. “Until then,” she said, “most of the people I had 					known had led rather narrow, humdrum lives; they were afraid of change and 					suspicious of new ideas. Edward Titus excited my imagination; he was an 					intellectual, interested in everything, and he had many friends in the literary 					and artistic world.” He took her to theaters and concerts; soon they were seeing 					a great deal of each other; and one day—to her surprise, she said—he 					proposed.

				“Marriage had never entered into my scheme of 					things,” she wrote at the end of her life.24 					She loved Titus, but she loved her business more; if she married now, would she 					ever fulfil her ambitions? So she followed her invariable habit when faced with 					a difficult decision, and fled the country. She packed her bags, withdrew 					£100,000 from the bank (the equivalent of about $11.7 million today5), and, leaving the Australian business in the safe hands of her 					sister and cousin, took ship for London.

				Until now, moneyed women had been heiresses, rich 					widows, queens, sometimes even empresses. Helena Rubinstein had become the 					world’s first self-made female tycoon.

				Helena had 					decided to go to London because it was “the world center of thought, taste, 					money and beauty.”25 But she knew nobody there, 					and her first few weeks were lonely. She shared a small flat in Arlington Street 					with an Australian girl she met on the boat, and spent her days trudging round 					the West End in search of suitable premises. Eventually she heard that a 					Georgian house in Grafton Street belonging to Lord Salisbury was for rent. It 					cost more than she wanted to pay but she took it nonetheless. It was in the 					right position, and the attic could be converted into a flat for her to live 					above the shop. Then she returned to Australia, where Titus awaited her, and got 					married. They at once reembarked for Europe, and a honeymoon on the French 					Riviera. Madame’s pattern for the coming decades was set: constant journeys, and 					an uneasy juggling of her personal and business lives.

				Helena Rubinstein’s marriage to Edward Titus might 					have been designed to provide ammunition for those who—like L’Oréal’s founder, 					Eugène Schueller—felt nothing but bad could come of women entering the world of 					work. Of course it was no new thing for wives to be richer than their husbands. 					But until now those wives, and their bank balances, had bolstered, rather than 					challenged, their fortunate husbands’ position in society. High-earning wives were something else—a novelty, and not 					necessarily an agreeable one psychologically.

				What was the role of such a person’s husband? 					Whether consort or housekeeper, it was quite evidently subordinate—even now not 					easy for many, and particularly hard in a culture where men had always been in 					charge. When Titus proposed, he talked about the business he and Helena would 					build together.26 But the business was entirely 					hers, and always would be. “He claims partnership in everything but everybody 					knows he has no claim to anything,” she complained in 1915.27

				Put like that, her attitude sounded selfish. But 					had the situation been the more usual one where the business belonged to the 					husband, there would not have been—and probably still would not be—any question 					of the wife claiming partnership as of right. It was only because Titus was a 					man that he felt it his due. Nor did the situation improve when Helena 					officially put him on the payroll. He earned his salary—he had a way with words, 					never her forte, and was good at advertising. But he hated the work, and the 					lack of independence affronted his self-esteem.

				Hers, meanwhile, was dented by his irrepressibly 					roving eye. Helena was now approaching forty, and her short frame, full of the 					copious meals she required to keep her energy up, was getting squarer by the 						year—brayder vi lenger (wider than she’s long), 					as her Yiddish-speaking family would have phrased it. Sex appeal had never 					figured high on the list of her attractions, and her constant hope that Titus 					might desire her sexually, as she desired him, was always disappointed. During 					the honeymoon itself, Helena walked into the hotel lobby one morning in “a haze 					of happiness” and caught him in rapt conversation with a pretty young girl. 					Humiliated and smarting, she rushed to the nearest jewelers and bought herself a 					pick-me-up in the shape of a string of fine pearls.

				She had found, as a lone woman in the man’s world 					of business, that wearing fine stones gave her confidence,28 announcing her as a woman of substance. Her 					self-respect momentarily buoyed, she caught the next train to Paris. By the time 					Titus caught up with her, however, she regretted her foolish behavior. She still 					kept the pearls, though, and added to them whenever there was a quarrel. Soon 					she possessed a good many pearls. “Buying ‘quarrel-jewellery’ is one of my 					weaknesses,” she would write, still, at ninety-two, using the present 						tense.29 By then, gems had become a 					personal statement, as habitual as the unchanging chignon whose severity they 					set off.

				When the honeymoon was over, Mr. and Mrs. Titus 					returned to London, where they installed themselves in the Grafton Street attic 					flat. Then Helena opened her doors and, once again, waited for customers.

				It was a nerve-racking moment. Opening a beauty 					salon in London was a far more complicated affair than opening one in Melbourne. 					London had no equivalent of the “bachelor girls” who had constituted her 					Australian clientele. In London, that clientele would have to be drawn from a 					quite different social stratum—that of well-to-do married ladies with generous 					dress allowances: a conservative social group, and one that for the past century 					had been accustomed to consider paint and powder a badge of whoredom. In 1894, 					the young Max Beerbohm contributed a satirical “Defence of Cosmetics” to the 					first number of the decadent magazine The 					Yellow Book. The article—which contended, 					improbably, that “enamelling” would confine women to the home, because the 					slightest movement would crack the painstakingly applied paint surface—outraged 					his readers, most of whom, like Max himself, hated cosmetics and would have been 					mortified had their womenfolk used them.

				In fact the piece was a spoof. Max’s real view was 					that “only women of the street resorted to rouge.”30 But the fury he unleashed among the supposedly unshockable 					readership of The Yellow Book showed that this 					remained a delicate area. And in 1908 the stigma still persisted. Customers 					came, but only after taking careful precautions. They found the prospect of 					beautification too tempting to resist, but still worried about the social 					consequences. “Many a time I watched from an upstairs window as [a customer] 					arrived, alone, in a covered carriage which dropped her discreetly at the corner 					of Grafton street,” Rubinstein remembered. “There, with her veil lowered, she 					would wait for a few moments, out of sight, she thought, until the street was 					free of passers-by. Then came the last few steps to the salon. . . . 					More than once I wondered what would have happened if any two of my furtive 					visitors had stepped simultaneously from their carriages and recognized each 						other.”31

				The new salon did not yet offer eye paint, rouge, 					or lipstick, though in her attic “kitchen” Helena had begun to experiment with 					tinted and perfumed powder to supplant the chalky rice powder then in vogue, 					which gave faces a peculiar whitewashed look. Although Queen Alexandra was 					rumored to wear cosmetics in the evening, only actresses really knew the art of 					makeup as it would later develop. They passed on useful tips to the stagestruck 					Helena, whose memoirs record many London evenings spent at the theater, at that 					time perhaps the only place where makeup was habitually and openly used. After 					trying out the new techniques herself, she would pass them on, in turn, to her 					bolder clients. In her correspondence with Rosa Hollay, who would become her 					London manageress in 1914, she mentions a “prep . . . called stage 					white for arms and neck, it positively does not come off.”32 She also offered skin analysis and facial 					treatments, including facial peels for bad cases of acne, the province of Frau 					Doktor List from Vienna.

				These treatments were expensive—ten guineas (nearly 					$1,600 in today’s money) for a course of twelve, or £200 ($32,000) for regular 					weekly visits the year round. But despite the expense, and their initial 					nervousness, the customers kept coming. Within a year there were over a thousand 					regular clients on the books, and in London, as in Australia, the money poured 					in. Later, when life had become less easy, she wistfully looked back to those 					early days. “We took in before the war about £30,000 a year and expenses were 					about 7 [thousand],”33 she told Rosa Hollay in 					1923.

				In 1909, Helena became pregnant. “I had not 					consciously longed for motherhood,” was how she put it in her memoirs; in fact, 					her first reaction was fury.34 Titus, though, 					was pleased, and in 1912 their first child, a son, Roy, was joined by another, 					Horace (an anglicization of Helena’s father’s name, Herzl). “The nursery teas 					with the boys, the evenings of gaiety with Edward [Titus] and our friends—all of 					these memories fill me even today with nostalgia,” she wrote fifty years 						later,35 exhausting the joys of motherhood 					in three lines before going on to devote several pages to her preferred topic, 					interior decoration. She was fond enough of her boys in the abstract—various 					somewhat stilted photographs show them together. But as many career women since 					have found, not only do the prosaic realities of child care tend to pall beside 					the constant excitement of a successful professional life, it is famously hard 					to combine the two. Helena’s great rival Elizabeth Arden had no children. Nor, 					for that matter, did her friend Coco Chanel, the most successful career woman in 					Paris. Her own summation in 1930 was, “Maternity, I believe, gives a richness to 					a woman’s life which no other satisfaction can replace, yet most women, during 					this generation at least, are finding that the home and the nursery are not 						enough.”36 Thirty years later Betty Friedan 					came to the same conclusion; her book on the subject, The 						Feminine Mystique, would become the catalyst for women’s liberation. 					It is doubtful, however, whether Friedan or anyone else would have recommended 					subordinating family life to business in quite the single-minded way Helena 					did.

				Despite her domestic ties—or perhaps because of 					them—this was a period of frenetic traveling for Helena. She visited Australia 					to keep Ceska up to the mark, and shuttled, when in Europe, between London and 					Paris. Helped by Titus, a cultured man who knew many writers and artists, she 					began to buy paintings and sculptures, and developed what would become a 					lifelong addiction to the Paris couture houses. In Paris, too, she acquired the 					severe and elegant hairstyle that would henceforth be her trademark, an 					uncompromising black chignon (later, she had it rinsed blue-black every six 					weeks) that set her where she would henceforth remain: outside time.

				It soon became clear that Paris could use its own 					Salon de Beauté Valaze. The couture business was becoming an important industry, 					with houses such as Worth and Lanvin beginning to show collections instead of 					simply making clothes for individual women, and Helena realized that the couture 					clients were also, potentially, hers. They needed to know how to make themselves 					up in a way that would set off their new gowns to maximum effect, and she could 					show them the way. In 1908 a herbal skin-products business came up for sale on 					the rue Saint-Honoré. Helena snapped it up, together with its stock, and set 					about its transformation. In 1911, she established her first factory, just 					outside Paris at Saint-Cloud, and in 1912, she relocated to France. Her sister 					Manka took over the London salon, while Helena, Titus, and the boys moved to 					Montparnasse. Madame had had enough of London and nursery teas.

				In Paris, although aristocratic society was every 					bit as closed and snobbish as in London, the raffish, the artistic, and the 					talented constituted a glittering haute bohème. If 					you were gifted enough—like Diaghilev, like Picasso, like Chanel—you were 					lionized even though (like Diaghilev) you were perpetually broke, or (like 					Chanel) notoriously a femme entretenue. And since 					artists must sell their work in order to live, rich patrons in search of art to 					buy could also become members of this charmed circle. Madame met everyone, 					including Marcel Proust—“Nebbishy looking . . . He smelt of 					moth-balls, wore a fur-lined coat to the ground—How could I have known that he 					was going to be so famous?” He quizzed her about makeup. “Would a duchess use 					rouge? Did demimondaines put kohl on their eyes? How should I know?”37 She preferred Chanel, that rarity of 					rarities—a self-made woman like herself. Why, Madame once asked the great 					designer, had she never married the Duke of Westminster, who had been her lover 					for so many years? “What, and become his third duchess? No,” returned Coco, “I 					am Mademoiselle Chanel and I shall remain so, just as you will always be Madame 					Rubinstein. These are our rightful titles.”38

				Parisians, unlike Londoners, had no qualms about 					being seen visiting a beauty salon. Particularly popular was Madame’s Swedish 					masseuse, Ulla. “You know, it wasn’t just an ordinary massage, they did little 					extra things,” Madame told Patrick O’Higgins; a hint of what those “extra 					things” might have been is perhaps to be found in her 1915 request to her London 					manageress, Rosa Hollay, for some small massage vibrators to be sent to New 					York, where she had then just opened her first salon.39 Colette, who had created a scandal when it emerged that she, not 					her husband Willy, had written the sexy Claudine books, and who received free 					treatments because of her publicity value, was particularly keen on Ulla’s 					massages. “Massage is a woman’s sacred duty,” Colette announced after her first 					visit. “The women of France owe it to themselves—without it, how can they hope to keep a lover!”40 Ulla was soon fully booked, while Colette was so taken with the 					idea of beauty salons that years later she opened one of her own. (It was not a 					success. Her clients did not emerge noticeably beautified and did not 					return.)

				In August of 1914 Madame’s European progress was 					interrupted. War was declared—and who knew how it would affect business, or what 					it would leave in its wake? Fortunately for her, however, one huge potential 					market remained unaffected. America was booming, and quite remote from the 					carnage. Titus held American nationality—and so, as his wife, did Helena. 					Everything pointed westward. She made a quick swoop on her London bank, 					appointed a new manageress, Rosa Hollay, to look after Grafton Street (where she 					would soon be joined by Ceska), and in October 1914 sailed with Manka for New 					York, leaving Titus and the two little boys in Paris to pack up the artworks and 					follow in her wake.

				In 					Australia and Europe, Madame had been a pioneer; in America she was pushing at 					an open door. A touch of lipstick made a girl feel good. Above all, it made her 					feel liberated. Participants in the big women’s suffrage marches held in New 					York in 1912 and 1913 were told to wear white shirtwaists—and red lipstick, the 					badge of independence. Domestic production of manufactured toiletries was 					nudging $17,000,000.41 Influential women’s 					magazines such as Vogue and Vanity Fair were eager to accept beauticians’ advertisements and to 					fill their columns with copy about fashionable persons and doings. And a galaxy 					of potent new role models was about to enter the public consciousness, as the 					budding film industry created a goddesshood of idealized beauties for whom heavy 					makeup was a working necessity. Helena Rubinstein liked to claim that she had 					taught Theda Bara, the notorious femme fatale who became known as “The Vamp,” 					how to apply her eye makeup. That was dubious, to say the least. What was 					incontestable was the effect Theda Bara’s makeup had on public ideas of what was 					acceptable and desirable. By the time Helena Rubinstein arrived in New York, 					every restaurant, hotel, and store of any importance kept a supply of cosmetics 					in their dressing rooms or bathrooms.

				The results of this enthusiasm were not subtle. In 					1910, a New York World reporter sitting in a café 					window on Forty-second Street and Broadway noted, “Eyelids can’t be painted too 					blue nor lashes too heavily beaded.”42 Madame 					was not impressed. “When I first came to America about ten years ago, I was 					shocked . . . by the number of young girls who were excessively made 					up,” she confided to the American Magazine.43 By contrast she offered a more subtle European 					exclusiveness. Madame Helena Rubinstein, “the accepted adviser in beauty matters 					to Royalty, Aristocracy and the great Artistes of Europe,” was ready, for a 					price, to show them how it should really be done. And everyone wanted to learn. 					Not just rich ladies but “Stenographers, clerks, and even little office girls” 					would be interested in what she had to offer.44

				After a continental railroad tour, to pick out the 					cities they would target, Helena and Manka returned to New York, where Madame 					began the now familiar business of locating a suitable site for a salon—her 					first in the New World. “We haven’t found a place yet, it seems to be very very 					difficult. Indeed there are thousands of places empty as things are not good in 					general. But as soon as I want one it costs £2500 a year,” she grumbled in her 					first letter to Rosa Hollay (adding: “See that you are economical with 					everything, even electric light”45). She 					settled upon a house at 15 East Forty-ninth Street, and in February 1915 a 					half-page advertisement appeared in Vogue announcing 					that “A Famous European ‘House of Beauty’ ” had opened its doors in New York. 					“At Madame Rubinstein’s Maison de Beauté Valaze treatments are administered for 					the removal of wrinkles, crowsfeet, coarseness of skin, puffiness under the 					eyes, blackheads, and other complexion defects. The New York salon radiates the 					same elegance, the same Spirit of Beauty, as her famous salons in London and 					Paris.” Helleu’s 1908 etching of Madame looking fey in an aigrette adorned the 					advertisement. It was the first of what would eventually total twenty-seven 					portraits by the day’s leading artists, from Marie Laurencin to Pavel 					Tchelitchew, Raoul Dufy to Salvador Dalí, that reflected both Rubinstein’s 					bottomless narcissism and the central role her image played in her business 					until the very end. In 1955 Picasso sketched her, but never worked up the 					portrait. “How old are you, Helena?” he asked her, to which she replied, evasive 					as ever, “Older than you, Pablo.”46 Three years 					later the British artist Graham Sutherland portrayed her as a monstre sacré, a craggy, baton-wielding field marshal 					weirdly attired in embroidered satin by Balenciaga, with kohl-rimmed eyes and 					thinning, boot-blacked hair, the whole topped off by a six-strand pearl necklace 					and Ping-Pong–ball diamond drop earrings. She was then eighty-six. (Sutherland 					was especially impressed by her makeup skills. He had made a number of 					preliminary drawings, but the day he began the actual painting, Madame had a 					fall. Left with two black eyes, she disguised them by applying copious rouge 					below them and green eyeshadow above. Sutherland was ecstatic, and at once 					abandoned all his earlier drawings. “She’s a completely different person. It’s 					amazing what really dramatic eye make-up can do!”47)

				Vogue ran two long 					articles in the months following the New York salon’s opening. They extolled the 					facial treatments of “a certain skin-specialist who has a small and smart 					establishment on 5th Avenue and gives her personal attention to each and every 					patron,” describing at length the wonders of the new salon and its “moving 					spirit . . . obviously a continental, and as chic as her charming 					individuality and Poiret costumes can make her.”48 Then they got down to the real business: all the various balms, 					lotions, rouges, powders, skin foods, and “beauty grains,” together with their 					prices, which were considerable. The smallest box of powder cost $1 (just over 					$21 today), while a large pot of cream rouge cost $6.50. In a city where most 					handbags were sold with specially fitted sets of cosmetic accessories—a powder 					puff, a rouge box, an eyebrow pencil—how could women possibly be persuaded to 					spend extra money on Helena Rubinstein’s pricey offerings?

				The answer was that the high price was an essential 					part of the treatment. Even if a woman could not afford costly facials and 					massages, she could still buy indulgence in the form of the same expensive 					cosmetics rich women used, and vicariously join the wealthy. When a woman paid 					$6 for a pot of Water Lily Cleansing Cream, “a rejuvenating cream de luxe for 					the ultra fastidious woman, containing the youthifying essence of Water Lily 					buds,” the mere possession of such a luxury helped her feel both youthified and 						richer.6

				Success, however, created its own problems. Buyers 					at stores all over the country clamored for her lines, but if Helena Rubinstein 					products became available in every corner drugstore rather than through her 					salons, then half the selling value—the half that derived from their 					exclusivity—would be lost. If the customer paid top prices, she expected the 					personal attention that went with them. As the advertisements put it, “A visit 					to [Madame Rubinstein’s] sanctum or an inquiry by letter solves many a little 					heartache that may be due to some shortcoming in appearance. . . .” 					But Madame could not be everywhere at once, nor could she open a salon in every 					city in America. How, then, was her special brand of personal service to be 					maintained?

				The solution, she decided, was to set up 					mini-salons in leading department stores, staffed by specially trained and 					uniformed women and made worthwhile because the condition of being allowed to 					stock Helena Rubinstein products was that her whole range had to be carried. 					When a suitably substantial order was received, Helena or Manka or both would 					travel to the store to train the sales staff—the famous “Rubinstein ladies”—in 					the appropriate introduction, promotion, and sales techniques.

				“I did not realise what I was letting myself in 					for!” Madame wrote later. “At night we trained the assistants to be beauty 					consultants and teachers, giving them a sound knowledge of my preparations and 					their use, to be imparted to their assistants, and to customers. For eighteen 					out of the twenty-four hours we were either travelling between one city and 					another or actively working. We lived out of our suitcases like actresses in a 					theatrical touring company.”49 It was hard 					work, but she loved it. What better way to spend one’s life? As she put it, “My 					only recreation is work.”50 Then and always, it 					was the literal truth.

				Titus, meanwhile, was left holding the babies. “We 					were naturally very glad to hear from you and of your safe arrival. There is 					practically a little kindergarten class here,” he wrote her in the summer of 					1919. The war had ended, and Madame had left for Europe to survey the remnants 					of her French and English businesses, leaving him in charge not just of Roy and 					Horace, now aged nine and seven, but Manka’s son, Johnnie, and a young cousin, 					Helena Silberfeld. “With a house so full of children it is difficult to have a 					little time to oneself.”51 As though she needed 					telling! Writing at midnight from Paris, where she had occupied a spare hour 					laying linoleum herself, she commented: “If Mr. Titus had been here I would not 					have made any progress whatsoever as he wouldn’t have allowed me to work.”52

				By 1924 Titus had had enough of this life. When he 					was unavailable, the boys were looked after by what their mother called “nice 					women”—the kind of impecunious ladies who in a previous age would have become 					governesses, and who, like governesses, were both better educated and cheaper 					than housekeepers, nurses, or maids.53 Leaving 					his sons to their uncertain care, he returned to Paris, his favorite city, where 					he would remain from then on. He had many old friends there, both from prewar 					days and from New York, which during the war had become a sort of 					Paris-in-exile.

				Artists such as Francis Picabia and the then 					little-known Marcel Duchamp, desperate to get away from war-torn Europe, had 					crossed the Atlantic in 1916 to find themselves American celebrities as a result 					of the great 1913 Armory Show of modern art. Lionized by wealthy collectors, 					they took their places at the center of a decadent, nihilistic, and blackly 					exhilarating whirl in which everyone desperately tried to block out what was 					happening across the Atlantic. But when the war ended, Paris became once more 					the center of art and excitement. The exiles returned, and Titus knew them all. 					With a mortgage from Helena’s property company Franc-Am Ltd., he opened a 					bookshop on rue Delambre. He sold rare books and manuscripts on the ground 					floor, and ran a small avant-garde publishing house, Black Manikin Press, 					catering to the anglophone colony, from the rooms above.

				Meanwhile, Madame was expanding her repertoire. She 					began to produce lipstick and other colored cosmetics and became interested, 					too, in plastic surgery and the famous (and soon to become infamous) 					monkey-gland extracts, both of which promised more tangible youthifying 					possibilities than water lily buds. Monkey glands had originally been the 					province of Dr. Serge Voronoff, who had observed that eunuchs aged faster than 					men still in possession of their balls and had concluded that grafting pieces of 					monkey testicle onto human testes might not only increase recipients’ potency 					but might also slow the aging process.7 By extension, 					he was now touting the possibility that grafting monkey ovaries onto women might 					produce similarly beneficial effects. A Dr. Kapp, whom Helena had met during her 					initial whirlwind tour of European skin specialists in 1905, and who had since 					been supplying her with creams and jellies, had become enthusiastic about this 					idea, and she was anxious to keep him on board. “Put down all sorts of imaginary 					things every month [i.e., as expenses] and I will take the money and pay Dr 					Kapp,” she instructed Rosa Hollay from New York in 1920. Mrs. Hollay was also to 					look out for potential surgery guinea pigs. “Do you know anyone who has a scab 					or a crooked nose or something?”54




IV

				By 1928, 					Helena Rubinstein had become a New York institution. The opening of her new 					salon at 8 East Fifty-seventh Street, on the site of Collis P. Huntington’s old 					mansion, was marked by an article in The 					New Yorker, carefully orchestrated by Madame to 					enhance her reputation for ice-cool acumen and elegant eccentricity. Her 					original salon “ranked” (the article reported) “even then, as one of the finest 					of all such ateliers in New York.” But she wanted a better place, and one she 					owned rather than rented. The palace of the Southern Pacific Railway magnate 					Collis P. Huntington, recently deceased, caught her eye: she took it instantly, 					“without pausing to inquire just how many thousands, or hundreds of thousands, 					of dollars the building could cost. She saw to it later that it wouldn’t be too 					many. Madame is impulsive but canny. . . .” When the salon was 					finished, she told the interviewer, she had to spend three days in a sanitarium 					to recover. “Always after the opening of a new salon she has a nervous 					breakdown; she expects it and looks forward to it. It is part of her 						schedule.”55

				Decided, imperturbable, astute, elegant—such was the public Madame Rubinstein. Her 					most potent product, as she well knew, was herself. Eagerly scanning Helena 					Rubinstein’s advertisements, emblazoned as they invariably were with pictures of 					the eponymous founder—ageless, elegant, beholden to no man—women hoped that if 					they did as she advised, they might become as successful as she was. Salon 					patrons would often plead for some extra-special beauty cream not available to 					the general public. If the customer insisted, she would be sold an unlabeled jar 					for $50, with the whispered assurance that it was “Madame’s own cream.”56

				But beneath the visible surface seethed a quite 					different person, assailed by anxieties, doubts, fury, and hypochondria. She had 					created this vast sprawling empire (“There are remote cities which have 					Rubinstein agencies where there are not even Ford agencies,” Vanity Fair marveled); everyone depended upon her for 					instructions, for policy, above all for money; and yet she felt, at every 					moment, as though the whole laboriously constructed edifice might come tumbling 					down and she would find herself in poverty once more. Her favorite photographs 					showed her in her white coat in a laboratory, one of the great women scientists 					of the world engaged in a ceaseless search for more potent ingredients. But she 					knew, even if she did not choose to remember, that her vaunted medical studies 					amounted to a two-month tour of visits to selected practitioners. At any moment 					some prying journalist might find her out and expose her for a quack.

				One solution to these constant worries—the solution 					favored by Titus—was to bow out, sell her business, and live on the proceeds. 					Eventually the temptation was too much, and on December 11, 1928, Lehman 					Brothers acquired the American arm of Helena Rubinstein. It netted Madame, who 					retained the European and Australian interests, a cool $7,300,000—over $84 					million today. All her worries should have been at an end.

				On the contrary, they got worse. Deprived of the 					work that had taken up the greater part of her time, she was bored and 					frustrated. Impotent to intervene, she had to watch as Leh-man’s sales strategy, 					which she had endorsed—to expand into a more mid-range market—came unstuck in 					the wake of the 1929 Wall Street crash. The upmarket end of the trade was 					unaffected. In fact, sales rose: the first example of the now well-documented 					“lipstick effect,” in which, during hard times, women who otherwise would have 					bought an expensive outfit buy a nice lipstick instead.8 But 					lower-priced items did less well, and the new range of mass-market goods tainted 					Helena Rubinstein’s upmarket outlets by association. “I knew that they would 					make a mess of it,” she told Patrick O’Higgins. “What do bankers know about the 					beauty business? Except that it can make money for them. After they bought me 					out they tried to go mass; to sell my products in every grocery store. Pfft! The 					idea wasn’t bad. But the timing was all wrong.”57

				In October 1930, she became ill—struck with 					appendicitis in Vienna, Titus said. But this was no mere appendicitis. The 					following May found her still confined to bed at her sister Ceska’s London flat, 					and boiling with frustration. Ironically, Titus, for the first time in his life, 					was enjoying considerable professional success. In the spring of 1929 his Black 					Manikin Press published D. H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s 						Lover, which went into three printings within a year. And in 1930 he 					published another smash hit, the English translation of Kiki’s Memoirs. Kiki was Man Ray’s mistress, and her racy tale came 					with embellishments by the Montparnasse Americans—saucy photos by Man Ray, and 					an introduction by Ernest Hemingway. Admittedly, Helena was fabulously wealthy 					and Titus still relied on her subventions, but for the first time in their 					married life, with Helena on a low and Titus doing well, the balance tilted his 					way.

				When she fell ill, Titus was kind and attentive, 					frequently coming over to visit her in London. After all the years of quarrels 					and separations, was it possible that their marriage might yet be salvaged? They 					were both over sixty, he pointed out—retirement age, when people think of 					drawing a pension and putting their feet up. The Lehman deal had given Helena 					more money than even she could ever spend. Wasn’t it time to relax a little?

				Depressed by this prospect, she hatched a new plan. 					The combination of the financial downturn and Lehman’s mishandling meant that 					shares in Helena Rubinstein, Inc., had sunk from $60 to $3. Why not try to buy 					back control? She could set the business on its feet again, and still be left 					with a healthy profit. Some of her old board members still remained in place. 					One of them slipped her a list of shareholders—mostly women—and she wrote to 					every one, explaining how the business’s only chance of survival lay in 					restoring it to the hands of its creator and convincing them to let her use 					their proxy votes. Meanwhile she bought whatever shares came on the market, 					building up a considerable holding.

				The whole process had to be conducted discreetly, 					and for a while it was uncertain whether or not it would succeed. A letter from 					Titus during this edgy period shows that he, for one, hoped it would not. “Look 					here, outside of your wounded pride, which is not a wound that can be healed, if 					you do not win, you will gain something more valuable,” he wrote.

				 You have two fine boys, 						whom you do not enjoy possessing, you have a husband if you would only once 						begin to really believe in him, who loves you truly and sincerely, whatever 						his faults are, you finally have yourself, to whom you have never, never 						given a real chance. These are the only things that substantially matter. 						The children’s life, your life and mine, the combined life of the four of 						us. Everything else are only things, just things. 						. . .58

				Vain hopes! Things, as 					he should have known, were all that mattered to Helena. An expenditure of $1.5 					million, combined with the proxies, netted majority control. Madame was in the 					saddle once more, with a net profit of $6 million after the sale and buyback. 					Lehman’s furiously issued a communiqué denouncing this brilliant maneuver as 					“financially illiterate,” but she had trounced them handsomely, and recovered 					her health and happiness in the process. “Ahead of me once more was the lonely 					treadmill of work,” she sighed in her memoir.59 					And with that, miraculously restored, she sailed for New York.

				The 					Authoritarian




I

				When people say at a dinner-party, “You’re so 					lucky to be in cosmetics!” I say, “Yes, but you had to realize that in 					1907.”

				—LILIANE 						BETTENCOURT-SCHUELLER, 1987

				Rue 					Saint-Honoré, where Helena Rubinstein opened her first Paris salon in 1908, is 					one of Paris’s most glamorous thoroughfares. But the backstreets that surround 					it are dark and dingy. Among the least prepossessing is a little corridor, 					called rue d’Alger, that links rue Saint-Honoré with rue de Rivoli. It was here, 					however, while Madame bustled about installing her stock and arranging couches 					and curtains in her new boutique, that the true revolution in cosmetics was 					taking shape. At the back of number 4’s dim courtyard a young chemist named 					Eugène Schueller had rented a two-room mezzanine to serve as a combination of 					laboratory, bedroom, and kitchen. He was working to isolate the world’s first 					safe artificial hair dye, and by the time Rubinstein opened her salon, he was 					almost there. For more than two years he had worked night and day, watching his 					savings diminish, cooking his food on the Bunsen burner he used for his chemical 					experiments. Finally he established his formula. He gave it the provisional name 					L’Auréole, after a hairstyle popular in 1905, the year he had begun his 					researches. Soon he would change this name to L’Oréal. Eighty years later, his 					company would swallow Madame’s.

				Like Helena Rubinstein, Eugène Schueller entered 					the beauty business at the optimum moment, when the market was ready but still 					untapped. Like her, it would make him rich. Like her, he spoke to the universal 					fear of aging, to every woman’s dread of wrinkles and grey hairs. But in every 					other respect, they, like their products, were utterly different.

				If you believed Helena Rubinstein’s advertising, 					her various creams and lotions were miracle balms that banished blemishes and 					left the user’s skin blissfully free of wrinkles. And since that was what her 					customers ached to believe, they convinced themselves that it was true—or, at 					the very least, that the creams prevented deterioration. There was never any 					proof, however, that this was actually so. By the 1930s a large number of firms 					were marketing beauty products of various kinds, and in 1934 the pressure group 					Consumer Research organized a survey of them, the first attempt at any 					systematic analysis of what beauty creams did. It showed that most beauty 					products did not live up to their claims, while some were even dangerous. None 					of the creams marketed by Helena Rubinstein or her competitors had, Consumer 					Research reported, any measurable effect on wrinkles, while the notion that skin 					needed three or four different types of cream—cold cream, cleansing cream, 					vanishing cream, and skin food—was a myth invented to increase sales. Worse, the 					glycerine frequently used in vanishing cream was a common allergen that often 					caused rashes.

				Beauticians like Rubinstein and her peers thus trod 					a wobbly psychological tightrope. On the one hand they shared their customers’ 					profound desire to believe the propaganda. On the other, they knew—none 					better!—that what went into their products was really nothing but the same old 					less-than-magical stuff women had always used, repackaged and skillfully sold. 					The Consumer Research survey therefore filled them with dread. On the day its 					results were published, in a book called Skin Deep, 					the cosmetics industry threw a party for magazine editors at the Pierre Hotel in 					Manhattan. The captive audience was harangued for an hour and a half on the 					wickedness of reformers and consumers’ research organizations and the 					irresponsible anticosmetic prejudice of the American Medical Association. It was 					magazines’ duty, the speaker perorated, to help preserve a million-dollar 					industry, now irresponsibly imperiled. Meanwhile the worst offenders hastened to 					change their more offensive products—Max Factor removing barium sulphate colors, 					which caused rashes, from its lipstick lines, Pond’s discontinuing the use of 					rice starch, which clogged the pores, in its face powder. But there was little 					they could do to make products such as face creams perform the wonders promised 					in the advertising copy—and they knew it.

				As it happened, they need not have worried. The 					public bought the book, which swiftly rose up the bestseller charts—and went on 					with their usual cosmetic routines. No exposé, however painstaking, could 					outweigh the magical allure of hope. A reader from California spoke for many. 						Skin Deep had “quite shattered my illusions as 					to the efficacy of cosmetics,” she wrote. But despite being “a college graduate 					and a schoolteacher, I don’t really so much believe what saleswomen tell me as I 					hope that what they tell me will come true.”1 					This blind and unquenchable desire—a desire that she herself shared—was the 					foundation of Madame’s fortune.

				L’Oréal was a different matter entirely. Like 					Helena Rubinstein, Eugène Schueller owed his success to both luck and talent. 					But his talent was for science, and his luck to have been presented with an 					opening that, left to himself, he would never have espied. In the beauty 					industry, whose claims routinely bore little if any relation to reality, his 					product was unique in that both he and his customers knew it would always do 					precisely what the package promised. L’Oréal worked: it would dye your hair any 					color you wished—and safely. And this was possible because of perhaps the 					greatest of all the differences between Eugène Schueller and Helena Rubinstein: 					he was educated, where she was not. The foundation of her business was folk 					wisdom; Schueller’s business rested on science. What was applicable to hair dye 					was applicable elsewhere, too. He could make other products, in other 					industries, and realize their possibilities as he 					had realized L’Oréal’s. It was simply a matter of time.




II

				Eugène 					Schueller, born in 1881, was nine years younger than Helena Rubinstein. He, too, 					came from a poor background. His grandfather was a shoemaker, his father a 					pastry cook, his mother a baker’s assistant. The Schueller family originated in 					Alsace, the much-disputed Rhineland province on the borders of France and 					Germany. Eugène’s father, Charles, who considered himself French and did not 					wish to be a German subject, had come to Paris with his wife, Amélie, after the 					1870 Franco-Prussian War, when Germany occupied Alsace.

				They bought a little patisserie at 124 rue du 					Cherche-Midi, in Montparnasse, where five sons would be born.1 Only one, Eugène, made it past infancy.2 And for this one surviving child the Schuellers would make any 					sacrifice. He was bright, and they determined to give him a good education, 					whatever it might cost. That way he might escape the hand-to-mouth poverty that 					constrained their own lives, forcing them to work from six every morning (five 					on Sundays) until ten at night (on Sundays till eleven) 365 days a year.

				Young Eugène was expected to take his share of the 					work. From the age of four he buttered tart tins and shelled almonds before 					leaving for school in the morning. The habit he then acquired, of early rising 					in order to lead two or more parallel existences, would remain with him. Later, 					when he gave lectures or interviews, he often described himself as “Monsieur 					6,000 hours” (2,000 hours a year being a normal conscientious working life). “Do 					you know what a 6,000 hours man is?” he demanded during a 1954 lecture at the 					Paris École de Commerce. “It’s someone who will work more than sixteen hours a 					day, 365 days a year, without Saturdays, Sundays or holidays.”3

				His daily routine showed what this work involved. 					He rose at four, and for two hours, in his dressing gown, addressed all the 					questions raised by colleagues the previous day. Then came an hour’s walk in the 					company of a physical-training instructor, followed by breakfast, when he read 					the papers. By the time his secretary arrived at eight a pile of notes and 					letters awaited her, each with the reply indicated in the margin. This secretary 					was the object of his pride and admiration: Schueller, possibly because he was 					rather deaf, could never believe anything was real unless it was written down, 					and she could take dictation at the speed of light.4 Another pile had penciled reminders of the replies he would 					dictate; a third had been read and thought about. Other replies were decided 					upon while the first batch were dictated. This went on until midday, when his 					Rolls arrived to take him to the Valentine paint factory at Gennevilliers—one of 					four businesses he was running in 1954, the year he gave the interview setting 					out this routine. (The others were L’Oréal, Monsavon soap, and a magazine called 						Votre Beauté.) Office work continued during the 					drive. At Valentine, he conferred with divisional heads until three p.m., 					lunching during these discussions on a grapefruit and a cup of tea. Then he left 					for Monsavon, taking with him a briefcase full of notes, and leaving at five 					with a second briefcase full. Then it was on to Votre 						Beauté and a third briefcase, and thence to the offices of L’Oréal, 					where he stayed until nine p.m. He went to bed at midnight, and slept four 					hours. But even then his work continued: “My best working-time is when I’m 					asleep,” he told business journalist Merry Bromberger. “During the afternoon I 					often listen to people without knowing how to respond. And then during the night 					I dream I’m in a meeting at L’Oréal, or in the lab with my chemists, and when I 					get up in the morning most of the necessary decisions have been made.” And so 					another day began.

				He remembered his early life, which had instilled 					this habit, as “very rough and hard on us.” But it produced enough money for his 					parents to send him to a private school, where he got on well. In 1890, however, 					the Panama Canal Company, in which his father had invested his small savings, 					failed. The shop had to close, and there could be no more private school. M. 					Schueller found a job in a big patisserie at Levallois-Perret, a working-class 					district on Paris’s northwest outskirts, where Eugène attended the local state 					school.

				And here, unexpectedly, Eugène’s private education 					resumed. Levallois abuts rich, leafy Neuilly, where the patisserie supplied a 					fashionable school, the Collège Sainte-Croix de Neuilly. M. Schueller made a 					deal with its head: if he made part payment in cakes, he could just afford a 					place there for his clever son.

				It was a life-changing moment—perhaps the most 					important thing that ever happened to Eugène Schueller. The Collège Sainte-Croix 					was a feeder school for the elite Lycée Condorcet, and after that the way was 					open to the highly competitive grandes écoles—the 					Polytechnique, the Centrale, the Ponts et Chaussées, the École Normale 					Supérieure, whose graduates run France. He was all set to join the ruling 					class.

				He duly made it to Condorcet, where the family 					scraped together enough to pay the fees. He discovered a bent for science, took 					his baccalaureate, and was hoping for the École Polytechnique or the École 					Centrale when his father was wiped out yet again. This time the family, 					including the sixteen-year-old Eugène, had to return to Alsace, and the German 					rule they had earlier rejected. His mother kept a market stall, helped by his 					aunt, whom Eugène remembered watching as she walked to the market barefoot, 					carrying baskets of goods weighing ten or fifteen kilos on her head. Eugène was 					apprenticed to a patissier, and also had to help his mother in the market, which 					he hated. A gifted publicist, he always loathed the business of face-to-face 					selling.

				He endured this life for a couple of years, and 					then could bear it no longer. Returning to Paris, he entered the Institute for 					Applied Chemistry, paying his fees by working nights as a patissier. This was 					chemistry’s heyday: Mendeleyev had recently formulated the periodic table of the 					elements, and Marie Curie would soon isolate radium. Eugène graduated top of his 					class, and Victor Auger, one of his professors, who had become a friend, found 					him an instructor’s post at the Sorbonne. The way ahead was clear. He would 					become a research chemist, and, eventually, a professor. Had he continued on 					this route, his friend Frédéric Joliot-Curie later remarked, he would 					undoubtedly have made some significant discovery.5

				But he found academic life disappointing—“dusty,” 					as he phrased it.6 The place, he said, felt 					like a cemetery. No one in France was much interested in science, there weren’t 					enough materials at the lab—even the gas supply was unreliable. And no one 					seemed to work. Accustomed from childhood to a punishing schedule, he felt 					cheated by academe’s comparatively relaxed pace. Why could one not get into the 					lab before it officially opened? Why did one have to leave when the bell rang? 					He would climb in and out through the window before and after hours, sometimes 					starting work at six a.m., sometimes staying on late into the evening—hours his 					colleagues inexplicably preferred to spend with their friends and families, or 					even in bed. He soon left for something less lackadaisical, a job at the 					Pharmacie Centrale de France, the standard manufacturer of chemical products. He 					remained there for three years, becoming head of the research laboratory and 					eventually head of the chemical service and secretary to the editorial board of 					its publication, the Grande Revue Scientifique.

				Some of the people he met during this trajectory 					would remain his friends for life. One was Jacques Sadoul, a friend from 					Condorcet who later became a Communist, and with whom he would conduct an 					experimental “free university” before World War I. Another was Fred Joliot, who 					later became Marie Curie’s son-in-law (and who added the Curie name to his own). 					Joliot and Schueller met at L’Arcouest, a tiny Breton village where the 					distinguished Sorbonne historian Charles Seignobos kept a cottage. Around the 					village, in a scatter of houses and rented rooms, a group of all ages known to 					all as “Sorbonne-sur-mer”—consisting of professors, their families, and their 					students—passed happy summers sailing, swimming, and living a quasi-communal 					existence. “A reporter suddenly finding himself in the midst of the peaceful 					group would have been overjoyed,” Marie Curie’s daughter, Eve, remembered. “He 					would have had to take great care not to step on some member of the Institut de 					France lazily stretched out on the ground, or not to kick a Nobel Prize winner. 					. . . These customs of children or savages, living half-naked in the 					water and the wind, were later to become the fashion and to intoxicate all 					classes from the richest to the poorest. But in those days . . . they 					aroused the shocked criticisms of the uninitiated. In advance of the fashion 					. . . we discovered beach life, swimming races, sun-bathing, camping 					out on deserted islands, the tranquil immodesty of sport.”7

				Eugène became part of the group at the invitation 					of Victor Auger. It was his first introduction to the notion that life, or parts 					of it, might be spent having fun, and he adored it. Ever after, recreation, for 					him, meant L’Arcouest and its pastimes. In 1926 he built himself a luxurious 					house there on a high spit of land that had once been a beautiful orchard. He 					kept his own yacht, the Edelweiss; Ambre Solaire was 					invented to counter the sunburn he suffered while sailing it. Sorbonne-sur-mer 					did not approve. The plot of land had first been noticed, and coveted, by 					another member of the group, and they found the house pretentious—there was even 					a colonnade, Fred Joliot remarked with disgust. Worse, he fenced his estate off, 					something unheard-of.8 Schueller didn’t care. 					He might love L’Arcouest and its pastimes, but once he became rich, the simple, 					communal life was not his idea of pleasure.

				The breezy outdoor life at L’Arcouest also set a 					benchmark for an ideal of feminine beauty. The magazine Votre Beauté, which he established in 1933, always included articles 					on the healthy sporting life, and promoted a tanned and glowing look that 					related more to fitness and exercise than paint and powder—something rather 					unusual in the 1930s.

				But academic life, even as enjoyed by 					Sorbonne-sur-mer, was not for him, and in 1905, after only two years as an 					instructor, he glimpsed a way of escape. A hairdresser came to the Pharmacie 					Central, offering to pay fifty francs a month to someone who would help him find 					a safe and reliable artificial hair dye. Schueller eagerly volunteered. A 					harmless hair dye might not be what Fred Joliot meant by an “important 					discovery,” but it was an interesting problem. Nobody had tackled it before, 					because hair dye was, as Schueller put it, “such a small part of the scheme of 						things.”9 That was to say, it was women’s 					frippery and therefore of little interest to male chemists. Indeed, they 					retained this blind spot even after it became clear that fortunes were to be 					made in the beauty business. In 1935, the Consumer Research book Skin Deep declared, “So far as we have been able to 					learn, there is no hair dye which is both certainly safe and at the same time 						effective.”10 In fact, such a hair dye had 					by then existed for nearly thirty years—but it was available only in France, and 					no American chemist had concerned himself with this problem.

				Schueller discovered that hair dyes were based upon 					four groups of substances: anilines, silver nitrate, pyrogallic acid, and lead 					acetate. The first group was the most dangerous. Aniline derivatives are very 					soluble, going through many intermediate stages before forming the lacquers 					which give the hair its new color, and some of these derivatives are extremely 					caustic and may eventually enter the bloodstream, affecting the white cells and 					giving rise to chemical eczema. Anilines were, nevertheless, the most popular 					base for hair dyes, because they were easy to prepare. Their dangers were known, 					but as only 3 to 5 percent of users were adversely affected, they were sold 					widely. Silver nitrate and lead acetate were less dangerous compounds, though 					still not altogether safe, but they turned the hair raven-black. “You could see 					it was artificial a hundred yards away,” Schueller remarked. Such blatant 					artificiality scandalized people: Eugène’s own mother would point her finger at 					a neighbor. “She’s using hair dye! And we thought she was a decent woman!” He 					finished by writing so many articles on the subject for the Grande Revue Scientifique that he eventually made a little book out 					of them: De l’Innocuité des teintures pour cheveux. 					(It is not dated, but since among the author’s many listed 					qualifications—Ingénieur-Chimiste, Diplômé de l’Université de Paris, 					Ex-préparateur à la Sorbonne, Ex-chef du Laboratoire des Recherches de la 					Pharmacie Centrale de France—he included “Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur,” it 					must have been published after World War I, when he received this 					decoration.)

				The hair-dye job meant working at the hairdresser’s 					salon in the evenings, from eight till eleven, at the end of an already 					unimaginably long day. Eugène’s excessive appetite for hard work had not 					endeared him to his boss at the Institute, and he soon found himself exiled to a 					factory at Plaine-St.-Denis, out in the northern suburbs. Work there started at 					6:30 a.m. There was as yet no Metro. To arrive in time, he had to get up at 4:30 					and take a tram. And at the end of the day, the hairdresser’s salon was on the 					other side of Paris.

				It was not long before Eugène fell out with the 					hairdresser—in one account because the hairdresser took no interest in the work, 					in another because Eugène wanted to claim all the credit for himself. The 					probable truth was that Eugène’s acute business antennae sensed the moneymaking 					potential of this work, and he preferred to pursue it on his own. The 					hairdresser, too, must have had some notion of a harmless hair dye’s commercial 					possibilities, else he would not have commissioned the work in the first place. 					He specialized in hair dyes, and his clients referred to his store of bottles as 					“the fountain of youth,” a phrase potent enough to start the mental 					cash-registers ringing loud and clear. He had only employed Eugène because he 					did not know how to make the new product himself and needed a consultant who 					did. Unfortunately for him, the consultant fate allotted him happened to be that 					extreme rarity, a brilliant scientist who was also a business genius, and whose 					sensitivity to potential moneyspinners, and ability to make them spin money, 					would turn out to surpass that of almost anyone else in France.

				The prospect of working for himself with a definite 					end in view, and of financial independence should he succeed, suited Eugène far 					better than dreary academic security. He decided to continue his research on his 					own account, and resigned from the Pharmacie Centrale. His boss was 					disbelieving. He was still only twenty-six and was already being paid a special 					salary, 250 francs a month. How could he give it up, just like that?

				It was indeed an excellent salary—so much so that 					during his three years at the Pharmacie he had managed to save 3,000 francs, 					enough to support him while he perfected his formulas. The only snag was, he’d 					lent most of the money to a friend who was not just then in a position to pay it 					back. He resigned anyway, on 800 francs, the capital remaining to him. The 					two-room apartment on rue d’Alger cost 400 francs a year, which since he had 					also to eat and buy materials gave him a little less than two years. The dining 					room became his office, the bedroom his lab. He lived alone, cooked for himself, 					and slept in a little camp bed until it was crowded out by laboratory equipment, 					when he took it up to a vacant storage room. “When I think back to those days, I 					can’t imagine how I got through them,” he reflected forty years later.

				His first product worked well on dead hair in the 					lab, but proved useless in the salon, on live hair still attached to a sensitive 					human scalp. He had therefore to begin all over again. But by 1907 he had his 					formula; all that remained was to sell it.

				How he summoned up the courage to go out and find 					clients he could never afterwards imagine. He was by nature rather shy, and a 					very bad salesman. But the product was excellent, and he soon got to know 					Paris’s fifty top hairdressers, who formed a respectable core of clients. He 					made his products at night, took orders in the morning, and delivered in the 					afternoons. By 1909, he had the satisfaction, “which I think I deserved,” of 					making a small profit. There were no margins. If he didn’t sell, he didn’t eat. 					Every bill, whether for raw materials or household necessities, was a nightmare. 					Nevertheless, L’Oréal was a going concern. On the strength of it he allowed 					himself to get married, and Mlle. Berthe Doncieux, whom everyone called Betsy, 					and of whom we know little save that she was musical and liked to play the piano 					and sing,11 came to share his storage-room 					bed.

				In every town, there will be shops where the scalp 					will simply be massaged with lotions, each more wonderful than the last—liquids 					that will prevent hair from turning white in the first place.

				—EUGÈNE 						SCHUELLER, Coiffure de 						Paris, 1909

				Although 					Eugène Schueller’s public career is amply documented, the private man remains 					elusive. He makes a few cameo appearances in other people’s memoirs. He gave two 					short accounts of his life, one in 1948, when he was tried for collaborating 					with the Germans, another in 1954, to Merry Bromberger. He produced a few 					treatises on politics and economics, and a good many articles and speeches. But 					in most of these writings he had one if not both eyes on his own or his 					country’s future. He always remained committed to L’Oréal, but as the 1930s 					progressed it became more and more the means to an end—an inexhaustible source 					of money that would allow him to influence the economic and political scene.

				There was little time for private life. The marital 					bed crowded out by laboratory and office requirements was as much metaphor as 					reality. And although later he surrounded himself with the trappings of 					luxury—big houses, a Rolls-Royce, specially commissioned furniture—his lifestyle 					remained ascetic. If you work, as he did, from five in the morning until nine at 					night, there is little time left for anything else.

				We can glimpse his progress in a magazine called 						Coiffure de Paris, whose first issue, in October 					1909, declared that it was “distributed free to Wholesale Buyers and to 					principal Practitioners in the Five Corners of the World.” A double-page 					photo-spread of founders’ portraits showed a cluster of well-set-up gentlemen of 					a certain age, with neat gray beards. In this portly and expansive company, E. 					Schueller, listed as one of the magazine’s “independent corporate publicists,” 					was noticeable for his youth and his abundant black, curly locks. Confined to 					the bottom right-hand corner of the page, he was seemingly a sort of 					afterthought. But this placement was deceptive. He was one of the magazine’s 					moving spirits. A hairdresser of his acquaintance had started it at the 					suggestion of a journalist, and co-opted Schueller because of his experience 					editing the Grande Revue Scientifique. Always 					publicity-hungry, he saw in it an excellent potential vehicle for his 					advertisements: L’Oréal occupied the whole of the back page, the space purchased 					at a cheap contributor’s rate. Before long, in a foretaste of events to come, he 					had taken the magazine over entirely and become its proprietor, editor, manager, 					and publicist.

				Coiffure de Paris, when 					it began, was largely about the now lost world of the postiche, the false hair 					piece every fashionable woman needed to achieve the bouffant hairstyles then in 					vogue (such as the one called “L’Auréole,” the original inspiration for the new 					hair dye’s name), necessary to support the vast hats of the period. Much of this 					hair came from Asia, though some was also harvested in the depths of la France profonde. A tragic photo in the magazine’s 					first issue, “Cutting Hair in the Corrèze,” showed one of the avuncular gents 					from the frontispiece, a large pair of scissors in one hand, triumphantly 					holding on high a thick mane of locks. Its erstwhile owner, shown in back view, 					sat crudely shorn on a bench, while to the right of the picture a second girl, 					still in possession of her hair, but about to lose it, and on the verge of 					tears, was being pushed forward by a grim-faced maman, intent on driving a hard bargain. But these were mere 					peasants, whose hair was wasted upon the Corrèze. Paris was its true home, where 					in studios such as “Postiches d’Art” “a buzzing hive of posticheuses” washed, 					colored, and otherwise prepared the raw material.

				The art of the postiche consisted in blending it 					undetectably with the wearer’s own hair—a complex and time-consuming business 					almost impossible to achieve at home. It had largely contributed to the spread 					of commercial hairdressing salons, as need overcame the traditional distrust of 					that immoral figure, the male hairdresser. And of course satisfactory matching 					necessitated a wide range of hair dyes.

				Amid the magazine’s fashionable hyperbole—“This 					season, big hats mean big hair”—the title of E. Schueller’s article, “Practical Techniques 					for Dyeing Hair,” struck a strictly down-to-earth note. Every month he supplied 					a piece on dyeing techniques and dangers, as well as answering readers’ 					questions. How, for example, should one deal with accidents that left hair green 					or purple? “This happens because you don’t know about hair dye, as you prove 					when you say ‘I tried in vain to dye it again.’ That’s just what you mustn’t do. 					When hair turns green, you don’t dye it again, you remove the dye that’s already 					there. What you’re doing isn’t colouring, it’s interior decorating—applying 					coats of plaster.”

				Schueller’s dynamism soon put him in charge of 						Coiffure de Paris. And that same year, 1909, 					L’Oréal, too, was financially transformed. One of Eugène’s cousins gave him an 					introduction to an accountant by the name of Sperry who worked for the liqueur 					firm Cusenier in Epernay. Sperry had just come into a small inheritance of 					25,000 francs which he was looking to invest. Impressed by Schueller’s evident 					intelligence and excited certainty, he agreed to set up a joint venture, 					Schueller et Sperry. He insisted, however, on a special safety clause. At the 					end of each year Sperry was entitled to withdraw if he chose, and if he did, 					Schueller would repay his 25,000 francs. The clause was never invoked. On the 					contrary, when Sperry became ill some years later and had to retire, Schueller, 					grateful for the the help Sperry had given him when he needed it, suspended it 					and paid Sperry’s full share of the annual profits (by then exceeding 25,000 					francs) every year until he died.

				This injection of funds allowed Schueller to set 					himself up more sustainably. He hired a delivery boy and splurged on some 					advertising. His first account books showed expenditures of 49 francs on 					salaries, 28 fr. 25c on publicity.12 And he and 					his wife, Berthe, moved from their cramped quarters in rue d’Alger to a 					four-room apartment at 7bis rue du Louvre, at the eastern end of rue 					Saint-Honoré. As at rue d’Alger, this apartment housed not only living quarters 					but the firm’s office, laboratory, and showroom. And as at rue d’Alger, the 					business expanded and expanded, until the Schuellers found themselves sleeping, 					as before, in a vacant maid’s room at the top of the house.

				For many years they remained childless. Perhaps 					this is hardly surprising. At first there was literally no room for children. 					And then war broke out, and Schueller enlisted. Whether by accident or design, 					it was not until 1922 that their only child, a daughter, Liliane, was born. 					Schueller was by then forty-one, and Berthe cannot have been a great deal 					younger. They had been married fourteen years; she did not become pregnant 					again. There are hints that this was not for want of trying. In the plan for an 					ideal world he set out in 1939, he insisted that women should marry young and 					conceive early, since after the age of twenty-five “children are conceived and 					born only with the greatest difficulty.”13

				The war interrupted the hair-dye business, along 					with everything else. Schueller was overage, and at first the army refused to 					take him. Later it agreed to admit him as a chemist, but he turned that down and 					was eventually inducted into the 31st Artillery at Le Mans, leaving L’Oréal in 					the hands of his wife. At the front he acted as a liaison officer, with 					spectacular success. The citations for his various decorations describe him as 					careless of personal danger, quick to grasp what was relevant, and precise in 					conveying necessary detail.14 He was mentioned 					in dispatches at Verdun, the Aisne, the Chemin des Dames; in all, there were 					five citations. He was awarded the Légion d’Honneur in the trenches, and by the 					time he was demobilized, in 1919, he was a lieutenant of artillery and had been 					awarded the Croix de Guerre with several palms. He enjoyed the army’s 					adventurous life, and its lessons in organization were useful to him later in 					business.

				He returned to find that Berthe had done an 					excellent job of managing the business. L’Oréal was flourishing, and the rue du 					Louvre apartment was now far too small. They moved once again, just around the 					corner, to rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, taking an entire floor at an annual rental 					of 16,000 francs—four times what they had previously been paying—and soon needed 					an additional floor for offices. Before long, revenue was running at 300,000 					francs a month, and a large proportion of that was profit.

				It all 					seemed too easy, and Schueller began to get bored. He diverted himself by 					embarking upon a voyage of industrial exploration, progressing from industry to 					industry as one led to another.

				The first move arose through his prewar activities 					at Coiffure de Paris. In search of advertising, he 					had met some manufacturers of celluloid combs. The war, with its demand for 					nitrocellulose explosives, meant a large development of their chemical division. 					They asked Schueller if he might be interested in helping them expand it, and 					how much money he would want for doing so. He explained that money was not his 					principal concern—he was already making plenty of that. What did interest him 					was how big they expected the business to become. They would be happy, they 					replied, with a million francs a year profits. By the end of the first year, the 					profits stood at 4 million francs, of which Schueller was entitled to 					one-quarter. Five years later, he had become the company’s principal 					shareholder.

				At the same time he started a new company, Plavic 					Film, which took control of the Lumière film-manufacturing company of Lyon (run 					by Auguste Lumière, one of the two brothers who in 1895 had made the first true 					motion picture). Plavic manufactured movie and still photographic film. He 					bought into another company that made Bakelite, and yet another making cellulose 					acetate and artificial silk.

				At this point, huge orders for celluloid began to 					arrive from Russia. Schueller had recently renewed acquaintance with Jacques 					Sadoul, his boyhood friend from the Lycée Condorcet. Capitaine Sadoul had been 					sent to Moscow in 1917 as part of a French military mission intended to make 					sure Russia remained on the Allied side. Excited by what he saw, he declared 					himself a Communist and declined to return to France. Having worked in various 					capacities for the Bolsheviks, he now returned to find that he had been accused 					of treason and sentenced to death in absentia, and 					took shelter with Schueller while gathering courage to give himself up. In the 					event, the charges were dropped. Sadoul returned to thank his old friend and, 					incidentally, put him in the Russian picture. The Russians, Sadoul said, were 					granting concessions to foreign businessmen to set up new industries in the 					U.S.S.R. Schueller, he insisted, should get himself in there.

				The upshot was a concession to make celluloid and 					also photographic film stock. In reality this boiled down to a comb factory. But 					in 1928, Lenin’s NEP (New Economic Policy), which had allowed small businesses 					to operate for private profit in an effort to rebuild Russian industry, was 					abandoned by Stalin in favor of a collectivization program of five-year plans, 					and the Russians bought Schueller out.

				Meanwhile, in 1927, he became interested in the 					manufacture of cellulose paints, which shared many laboratory processes with 					celluloid, and was soon managing director of a paint firm, Valentine. As he put 					it, however, “it wasn’t enough to manufacture paint—we also had to sell it”15; so he went to see André Citroën, whose 					company was the world’s fourth-largest automobile manufacturer. Citroën gave him 					a contract for 23 million francs; there were also valuable contracts with 					Renault and Peugeot. But this arrangement, though lucrative, left the company at 					the mercy of just a few clients. Schueller decided to branch out and sell his 					quick-drying paints to the public—by radio.

				Radio advertising was new. It had hit France 					courtesy of the young advertising genius Marcel Bleustein, who recognized its 					potential during a year’s stay in America. Returning to Paris in 1926 at the age 					of nineteen, he opened his own advertising agency, Publicis. By Christmas of 					1927, he had his first client, and in 1935 bought a private station, Radio LL, 					which he rechristened Radio Cité. It was the first station in France to 					broadcast uninterrupted from six a.m. till midnight, with talent contests, news 					reporting, singing stars such as Maurice Chevalier and Edith Piaf—and 					commercials interspersed amid the programming. Schueller persuaded Bleustein to 					let him advertise with a sung jingle, in the style of Maurice Chevalier:


Elle se vend en tout petits bidons,

				Valentine, Valentine,

				Elle se fait dans les plus jolis tons,

				Valentine, Valentine. . .

				(It’s sold in little cans, / Valentine, 					Valentine, / And in such pretty tones, / Valentine, Valentine 					. . .)

				At first Bleustein was reluctant—perhaps because he 					hadn’t thought of this idea himself. But Schueller won him over, and the 					advertising jingle hit France.

				After a while, Schueller decided to exchange his 					shares in plastic and celluloid for his partners’ shares in Valentine, leaving 					him with just two business interests—Valentine and L’Oréal. But this comparative 					calm did not last long.

				In 1928, following his Russian adventure, Schueller 					had got involved with yet another business: a brand of soap called Monsavon, 					created just after World War I by a M. Wisner. The brothers Henri and Philippe 					de Rothschild were persuaded to put 18 and 20 million francs, respectively, into 					the business, lost the lot, and wanted out. They were prepared to sell cheaply. 					Schueller bought it from them for nothing, paying only for existing stocks and 					such money as remained in the bank.

				Monsavon went on losing money. It wasn’t a bad 					product, but brands like Palmolive and Cadum were much better known—so much so 					that shoppers, especially in rural areas, would request “a cadum of 						Monsavon.”16 Schueller was losing 300,000 					francs a month. He sold his cars and mortgaged the two houses he now owned, at 					L’Arcouest and at Franconville, just outside Paris.

				With Valentine and L’Oréal both flourishing, the 					obvious answer was to cut his losses and close Monsavon down. But acknowledging 					defeat was something he could not bring himself to do. Business, for him, meant 					risk. “Difficult problems like Monsavon interest me more than easy successes,” 					he said at the end of his life. “It’s the way I’m made. . . . You 					can’t argue with the way you’re made.”17 He 					reduced production: the monthly loss fell to 30,000 francs, a level he could 					bear. He reformulated the product, reorganized the factory, publicized the 					improvements in the papers. Sales still did not rise.

				The problem Schueller faced was the problem all 					cosmetics and toiletry manufacturers face—that their products are almost 					indistinguishable, and that brand loyalty must somehow be engineered despite 					this. Publicity is therefore all important. As Helena Rubinstein observed, 					“There’s nothing like a clever stunt to get something off the ground.” Her 					favorite campaign was the one for the fragrance “Heaven Sent,” when in the late 					1940s thousands of pale-blue balloons were released over Fifth Avenue, each one 					bearing a sample of the fragrance, with the tag: “A gift for you from heaven! 					Helena Rubinstein’s new ‘Heaven Sent.’ ”

				Schueller, too, realized that he needed a really 					huge publicity campaign. He returned to Bleustein and Radio Cité, and this time 					he did not confine himself to mere jingles, but bought an entire program, the 					extremely popular Crochet Radiophonique, which he 					interspersed with catchy advertisements for Monsavon and sponsored singing 					contests, broadcast live from different locations. For six months nothing 					happened. Then sales suddenly took off. Monsavon took and retained first place 					in soap sales. Schueller was vindicated.

				Sales of L’Oréal also rose during the 1920s, not 					because of any advertising campaign but because of a new hairstyle: the bob. The 					fashion for short hair began during World War I, when many women took jobs in 					factories. The popular film stars Clara Bow and Louise Brooks were famously 					bobbed, as was Coco Chanel, the up-and-coming fashion designer, who cut her hair 					off after singeing it one day. Just as Chanel’s straight, comfortable clothes 					meant the end of corsets, padding, and petticoats, so her new short hair did 					away with laborious, long-drawn-out hair-washing and -drying sessions. Women 					everywhere began to cut their hair. Like lipstick a few years earlier, the bob 					became the symbol of a new freedom and independence. Men were horrified. “A 					bobbed woman is a disgraced woman!” thundered one in outrage. “ . . . 					How strangely ill at ease our poor shorn sisters would have been had they been 					present in the Bethany home that day!”18

				Schueller, too, was gloomy—not because of possible 					troubles in Bethany, but because L’Oréal’s sales had always been predicated on 					women having lots of hair to dye. He anticipated a catastrophic drop in demand. 					He could not have been more wrong. Short hair needs frequent cutting, and only 					men’s barbers had the appropriate skills. Faced with a female invasion, they 					were hesitant at first, but soon reinvented themselves as hairdressing salons, 					and flourished as never before. “Before the bob became the accepted style, there 					were less than 11,000 beauty shops in America. . . . Today there are 					more than 40,000 beauty shops in operation in America alone,” wrote hairdresser 					George E. Darling in 1928.19 And more 					hairdressers meant more hair-dyeing outlets.

				Short hair did, however, present some difficulties 					when it came to coloring. The bob was about modernity, and hence youth: a gray 					bob looked anomalous. But a large proportion of short hair consists of roots, so 					that any coloring must be frequently retouched. And this meant frequent dyeing 					sessions, which were bad both for the hair and the pocket.

				One easy answer was to bleach. Schueller set to 					work and produced L’Oréal Blanc. It quickly became the rage. Advertisements 					throughout Europe and America were overtaken by a blond invasion. He soon 					occupied the whole building in rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and opened, too, his 					first proper factory, in rue Clavel, out in Paris’s 19th arrondissement. In 					1929, for the first time, L’Oréal achieved revenues of more than a million 					francs a month.

				Almost at once another problem presented itself: 					the permanent wave, or as it was more usually known, the “perm.” The difficulty 					this time was that perms do not take on dyed hair if the dye forms an 					impermeable colored film on the outside of the hairs, as L’Oréal’s existing dyes 					did. Permed hair needed a dye that would penetrate the hairs and color them from 					the inside. Some new British and American dyes did this, and threatened to sweep 					the market.

				Schueller had in fact discovered and patented just 					such a dye during his early researches, in 1907. But he had never used it. As 					with the penetrating dyes his competitors were selling, its active ingredient 					was paraphenylenediamine. “Para” had a fatal flaw: as Skin 						Deep would reveal, some people were allergic to it. If they used it 					they would suffer from an itchy, flaky scalp, or in the worst cases a facial 					rash and swelling of the eyelids, face, and neck. Urged now by his colleagues to 					resuscitate this dye, Schueller hesitated. L’Oréal’s reputation was built on its 						not provoking allergic reactions. “If one client 					starts to scratch, there go twenty years of confidence!” he objected. But 					without the new formula, sales would continue to fall.

				Schueller decided the only remedy—and the only way 					to outflank his competitors—was to be frank. The new dye, called “Imédia,” was 					launched with a warning: it might be dangerous. New users were advised to dab a 					drop behind an ear and wait forty-eight hours. If an inflammation appeared, the 					dye should not be used. At the same time he advised that should an allergic 					reaction declare itself, there was an antidote: a rinse of brine mixed with 					oxygenated water, which would remove the offending substance. The policy worked, 					and sales jumped.

				By the mid-1930s, L’Oréal employed three hundred 					salesmen where once it had employed ten, and the company decamped once again, to 					the imposing building in rue Royale that remains its headquarters to this day. 					Like all L’Oréal’s successive headquarters, as it outgrew one building after 					another, this building, too, was just a few steps from rue d’Alger. But by this 					time both L’Oréal and its founder had moved, definitively, into the other, 					brilliant world—the world of rue Saint-Honoré that in 1908, though physically 					close, had been at the same time so immeasurably distant.




IV

				What I always tried to do, in dealing with people, 					was to provide them with something they seemed cruelly to lack: a goal in 					life.

				—EUGÈNE 						SCHUELLER, 1957 						20

				Like Helena 					Rubinstein’s endless scurryings from one side of the world to the other, Eugène 					Schueller’s zigzag path from industry to industry bore the mark of compulsion. 					They had to keep moving or they were lost. But these compulsions had 					diametrically opposite roots.

				Rubinstein’s career was chaotic, a progression of 					brilliantly executed extempore sallies. Just as her business was an extension of 					herself, peopled by the sisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces who were her pale 					imitations, so her constant journeyings reflected her emotional life. They might 					go under the name of business necessity, but the essence of Madame was that 					business and emotion were not separable. Every crisis—the row with her father 					when she turned down his choice of husband and left his house forever, Edward 					Titus’s insistent desire that she marry him, the arrival of children, the 					outbreak of World War I, the sale of her American business to Lehman Brothers, 					the outbreak of World War II—was marked by physical flight, to another country, 					another continent, another beginning. Stuff happened, and she dealt with it 					somehow, and because she was clever and thought nothing of the world’s opinion, 					simply following her instincts, which rarely led her astray, things turned out 					all right. And then there was more stuff, and she dealt with that. She ran on 					adrenaline: her chaotic, compulsive letters to Rosa Hollay, in which the worry 					of the moment was scribbled down whenever it might occur on whatever scrap of 					paper lay to hand, reveal the constant, jumbled panic beneath her assured 					exterior. “I haven’t paid any bills the last three weeks, let me know again what 					must and should be paid now. I am frightfully short of money, it seems worse and 					worse. . . . I often don’t know if I am on my feet or my head.” “I am 					in such chaos, I am most thankful to have good constitution all the same I feel 					at times I will go mad, the worry and the responsibility is just eating me up. 					. . .” “I do actually nothing and work all the time.”21 However successful, however mountainously 					rich, hers was life as crisis management. “I have too much on my shoulders. I’m 					surrounded with people, but I can’t get to them. . . . People 					. . . people . . . and I’m alone! With burdens 					. . . such burdens!” she told Patrick O’Higgins the day she offered 					him the indeterminate job that would keep him by her side for the rest of her 						life.22

				Schueller, by contrast, was in control. In the 					world, as in the laboratory, he knew what he wanted to achieve and methodically 					set about achieving it. He was a scientist, and therefore saw the universe as a 					place of logic and patterns. Human life was no exception: without a pattern, all 					was chaos. Having abandoned the Catholic faith of his childhood, he spent the 					rest of his life constructing a substitute for it, a framework within which a 					modern industrial state might function fairly and efficiently for the benefit of 					its citizens.

				This fascination with possible worlds surfaced in 					some unexpected places. The opening paragraphs of his earliest contribution to 						Coiffure de Paris, the October 1909 essay on 					“Technical and Practical Hints on Hair Dyes,” plunged its readers into a world 					of scientific fantasy.

				In four or five years 						from now, our bicycles will have become monoplanes weighing a hundred kilos, 						which will carry one or two people, and on which it will be possible to 						travel from here [Schueller evidently assumed all his readers lived in 						Paris] to Orléans in an hour.

				When that happens, there 						will probably be no more hair dyers. That delicate, difficult, and sometimes 						even dangerous profession will exist only in a few lost villages in Morocco 						or Calabria. Nor will there be any more dyeing of white hair. Instead, in 						every town, there will be shops where the scalp will simply be massaged with 						lotions, each more wonderful than the last—liquids that will prevent hair 						from turning white in the first place.

				Eagerly, Schueller outlined the chemistry by which 					this future would be achieved. The magic liquids would be “dilute solutions, in 					alcohol, tafia, or rum, of some di- or tri-ethylaminoparoxybenzene which will 					recolor any hair, whatever its original color, that will be harmless and that 					everyone will use each morning, like powder or toothpaste, but”—a bow here to 					the readers of Coiffure de Paris—“which many will 					prefer to have applied by a hair artist—the successor of today’s hairdressers.” 					Another miraculous invention would abolish the barbershop: men would simply rub 					their faces with an oil that stopped the hairs from growing.23

				Here is the authentic voice of the times, of Jules 					Verne and H. G. Wells, of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. 					Like them, Schueller was enraptured by the new worlds science was opening up, 					convinced that it would transform the future in unimaginable ways, and eager to 					share this vision with a wondering public. There was, of course, an important 					difference between them and him. Where Verne, Lang, and Wells expressed 					themselves through stories, Schueller aimed to work his transformations in 					reality. But whatever its medium, one significant corollary of Schueller’s 					visionary mind-set, with its scientifically argued blueprints for ideal worlds, 					was a deep impatience with the retrogressive dullards who refused to act on 					these excellent ideas. And this impatience would point the way to dark 					places.

				Schueller was always conscious that had he not 					received the kind of education rarely available to bakers’ sons, he would 					probably, despite all his abilities, have remained poor. He was aware, too, that 					that education had been largely a question of luck. Despite his parents’ desire 					to give their son the best possible start in life, he would have had to make do 					with whatever the state could then provide had not the Collège Sainte-Croix, in 					an unusual access of imagination, accepted part payment of his school fees in 					pastries. He therefore directed his first social efforts towards education. He 					felt it was time to end the self-perpetuating mandarinate of the 					supercompetitive and expensive grandes écoles that 					excluded so much talent even when—as in his own case—a poor boy had demonstrated 					unusual intellectual potential. Intelligent working-class men seemed to him 					particularly disabled by their lack of math and science education,24 and he wanted to remedy this personally, so 					far as he could. Before they were even twenty, he and his friend Jacques Sadoul, 					who shared his concerns, had founded a modest people’s university at La 					Chapelle, a poor area to the north of Paris, where they taught in their free 						time.25

				Soon enough, of course, there was no more free 					time, at least for Schueller, and the teaching lapsed. But despite his 					increasingly frenetic level of activity, first with L’Oréal, then in the army 					during World War I, then during his headlong progress through assorted chemical 					industries during the 1920s and thirties, his concern with the unsatisfactory 					state of the world, like Sadoul’s, continued. Sadoul turned to communism and 					took refuge in the nascent Soviet Union; Schueller, the self-made man, set about 					designing a new, improved capitalism.

				His sense that the old model was failing 					crystallized during the 1920s. In 1923, at the height of the great inflation, he 					made a trip to Germany, where L’Oréal had opened an agency, and “felt, for the 					first time, that the world had veered off-track.” Three years later, in France, 					it veered off again, almost as catastrophically, though in the opposite 					direction, as the franc was revalued. “Factories full of orders were going day 					and night . . . and suddenly, customers stopped ordering. A month 					later they wouldn’t even take delivery of stuff that was already in the 					pipeline, and I had to close two out of three factories.”26

				One day he realized that with modern machines he 					could double production using only half his existing workforce. But if only half 					the previous number of workers were earning salaries, who would be there to buy 					the goods? Then he had a revelation. If salaries were 						doubled along with production, there would still be buyers. 					“Capitalists had to realize that they should stop lowering prices while trying 					to maintain their profits by cutting salaries too. On the contrary, what they 					needed to do was not lower prices but raise salaries—not in an unplanned way, as 					when workers demanded and threatened [and employers gave in]—but mathematically, 					raising them as production increased. The trick was to raise buying power, not 					lower prices. Lowering prices would never absorb overproduction, because it was 					impossible ever to lower them enough.”27

				Over the next few years Schueller worked out his 					economic theories. He first expounded them in a speech to old Sainte-Croix 					pupils in 1934, later published as an article in the Sainte-Croix de Neuilly 					magazine. The article created such a stir that he was encouraged to spread the 					word wider, which he did at two meetings of industrialists. Later, in 1936, he 					published a journal, L’Action patronale, in which 					employers were exhorted to social reform. Finally he set out his programs in two 					books, Le Deuxième salaire (The Second Salary), 					written in 1938 and published in 1939, and La Révolution de 						l’économie, published in 1941.

				What was needed, he was convinced, was a new 					formula for paying workers. They would receive their salaries as usual at the 					end of each month—but this basic pay would not be their only pay. In his own 					industry, he reckoned that salaries should amount to 30 percent of the product’s 					factory-gate selling price. If, at the end of the month, 30 percent of total 					receipts amounted to more than the total of the workers’ agreed-upon basic 					salaries, the difference would be paid out to the workers, apportioned according 					to their individual work records. Thus: the “second salary.”28

				This system would have several advantages, of which 					the first and most important was that workers, instead of spending the day 					watching the clock, would work hard because they would benefit personally if the 					business flourished. He himself, Schueller said, had spent a good deal of his 					youth performing boring manual tasks, and recognized that the reason this had 					never bothered him was because, unlike most workers, he had always, even when he 					was very young, been working for his own benefit rather than an employer’s. Of 					course, few young men were as driven as he had been. Nevertheless, the second 					salary would make every worker a stakeholder in his own factory.

				It would also, Schueller thought, solve the problem 					of impersonality, which inevitably increased as the business grew larger. While 					his own business had still been small, he had worked alongside his employees and 					transmitted his own enthusiasm to them. But when it grew larger, and personal 					contacts became rarer, he saw that most workers had no real interest in their 					job. It was then, he wrote, “that the problem of restoring some sense to the 					life of the men who worked in my businesses began to obsess me.”29

				These theories, dismissed by contemporaries as 					“Schueller’s dada” (Schueller’s hobbyhorse) were in 					fact extremely forward-looking. As he realized, in a recession nothing is more 					fatal than the deflationary spiral of ever-reduced prices, jobs, and wages. It 					was this problem he sought to tackle.

				Schueller knew the second salary worked: he used 					the system in his own factories, and they, as everyone could see, flourished.2 Others of his ideas—social security for the unemployed paid for 					through an automatically deducted national insurance (revolutionary, he 					admitted, “but we live in revolutionary times”30); a united Europe in which the mark and the franc would be one 					monetary unity in a European economy31—are now 					part of everyday life. In economics he was a visionary, and a benign one.

				He did not stop at economics, however. Having 					lighted upon an idea that he felt would save the world, he felt impelled to 					design the world he would save. And that was altogether more problematic. For 					the second salary did not take the form of a simple monthly addition to the 					paycheck. Rather, it went to workers’ wives and children, to the retired, the 					ill and the unemployed, in the form of grants. Only after these grants had 					permitted the wives, children, and old to live “properly” were surpluses passed 					on to the workers themselves, as bonuses.32 But 					who was to define “properly”?

				Not the workers, that was for sure. Schueller did 					not believe in consultation. To run an enterprise jointly was, he felt, “humanly 						impossible.”33 He saw egalitarianism, “the 					determination not to recognize any superiority, and never to admit the truth,” 					as a sort of social gangrene. Trade unions and work councils were destructive 					rather than constructive; the noisiest propagandists always got elected, and 					then had to justify their election by making unreasonable demands. Concerned 					only with their short-term interests, they were part of the company, but not for 						it.34 Everything about workers’ lives 					precluded the visionary detachment essential if those lives were to be 					improved.

				Schueller, on the other hand, felt himself uniquely 					well placed in this respect. France in the first half of the twentieth century 					was a very static society, and his rise from poverty to wealth and power had 					given him an unusually broad view of it. His scientific training and industrial 					experience meant that he had a wide personal experience of design, production, 					and publicity. Through his factories, he remained intimately acquainted with how 					the poor lived, and he devoted much of his business life to teaching them better 					habits, in the form of cleanliness. For him, advertising was not just a way to 					raise sales but a tool for improving people’s living standards. “People are 					lazy,” he told business journalist Merry Bromberger. “You have to push them to 					spend, to consume—to move on. When I advertise . . . I feel I’m 					working in the public interest, not just for myself.”35

				This evangelistic inclination was also evident in 						Votre Beauté, the magazine he published monthly. 					His original magazine, Coiffure de Paris, had 					become, by the 1920s, Le Coiffure et la mode. But 					despite carrying its articles in English, Spanish, and German, presumably to 					increase international sales, this was still of very limited interest compared 					to the general-interest women’s magazines he saw on visits to England. So in 					1933 Le Coiffure et la mode became Votre Beauté, complete with readers’ letters seeking 					help for confidential problems (one of its most important sources of copy), as 					well as the latest from the couturiers, interviews with prominent society women 					and actresses, and assorted beauty hints. The result was a much wider readership 					and advertising base.

				Although Schueller’s name did not appear above any 					of the articles, he wrote a great deal of Votre 						Beauté himself. And this gave it a particular flavor. In similar 					American and British magazines, beauty hints meant discussions of cosmetics, 					creams, and the best ways to apply them. But such things had little place in 					Schueller’s world: he neither made nor used them. Instead, French women were 					exhorted to make themselves beautiful through strict routines of diet and 					exercise. From thinness and fitness, all else followed. “Do marrons glacés put 					on weight?” enquired “Rose d’Orléans” in the first selection of readers’ 					letters. “Yes!” came the uncompromising answer—followed by a calorie breakdown 					showing that a single marron put you 100 calories to the bad (the recommended 					daily intake being no more than a meager 1,500 calories all told3).36 Many readers wanted to grow 					taller: they were advised to stand up straight—and, above all, to exercise. 						“It is a crime,” thundered an editorial in 					January 1934, “not to make the most of such an easy and 						pleasant way of improving your physique, keeping young, and prolonging your 						life!” Pages of detailed drawings and photographs introduced readers 					to winter sports (their skins protected, of course, by L’Oréal’s Ambre Solaire), and every issue contained a new, 					health-giving diet. When Colette, whose love of good food was legendary and who 					in later life had become very plump, wrote a piece in her journal saying fat 					women were happier than thin ones, Votre Beauté’s 					disapproval was almost hysterical. “Colette, dear, wonderful Colette, we all 					know you’re too fond of food. . . . But, for heaven’s sake, don’t try 					and make converts. . . . Go to all the banquets in the world, but 					don’t put your genius at the service of big bottoms and fat thighs!”37

				In particular (a clue, here, as to the editor’s 					particular predilection?) women were exhorted to take care of their breasts. How 					to stop them sagging? (Exercises.) How to prevent them getting too large? 					(Stimulate ovarian activity as soon as puberty sets in, as sluggish ovaries lead 					to oversize breasts.) How to make them bigger? (Exercise.) Every issue contained 					a page of before and after photographs, in which nipples, following the 					recommended treatment, migrated upwards as if by magic; every month Dr. Magnus 					Hirschfeld, a well-known pundit and “the uncontested master of sexology,” 					recommended his special hormone treatment (also with before and after 					photographs). A despairing reader, writing in to ask if she should undergo 					breast reduction surgery, was, however, recommended not to do so immediately. 					Big breasts weren’t necessarily a complete barrier to attraction; she shouldn’t 					give up hope, and she should remember that surgery left scars.

				Economics, health, beauty—who better than such a 					universally qualified man to propound the basic principles of utopia? The 1930s 					in France was a time of intense theorizing on both the left and the right, and 					everyone was eager to set out his own plan for national renewal. Schueller was 					no exception. In his book Le Deuxième salaire, 					published in 1939, he described his ideal world. To begin with, every family 					would have a house, ideally one designed by Schueller himself. In 1929 the 					American architect R. Buckminster Fuller had designed a house made of aluminum 					with premolded pipework, kitchen, and bathroom, and intended for low-cost mass 					production, that he called the Dymaxion House. Schueller made no mention of 					Fuller in his writings, but his own design incorporated many Dymaxion-type 					features—aluminum construction, industrial prefabrication, molded bathrooms. The 					Schueller house was prefabricated along the lines of an aircraft hangar, its 					triple-skinned aluminum frame providing heat and sound insulation, and its 					ogival shape giving a lofty sense of space. It was built from modules 85 					centimeters long, 6 meters wide, and 5 meters high: house sizes would vary 					depending on the number of modules used. Large windows and skylights would make 					for light, airy spaces. Modern domestic necessities would be built in: piped 					water, washing machines, ironing machines, fridges, radios. The furniture would 					be of the latest wonder material, Bakelite, and designed by the best designers 					(Schueller was a connoisseur of fine furniture, commissioning his own from the 					great Art Deco designer Ruhlmann, whose clients also included Baron Henri de 					Rothschild, from whom he had bought Monsavon). Schueller’s suburbs would be 					spacious and green, with widely spaced dwellings set among intensively 					cultivated vegetable gardens, along the lines of William Morris’s 1890 utopian 						News from Nowhere, which advocated a bucolic 					lifestyle in harmony with the natural world.4 Transport 					would consist of small family cars with an average ten-year life span. People 					would wear modern fabrics, crease-resistant and stretchy. Only young, strong men 					would work in industry, traveling to work in car pools. Women would stay home, 					devoting their lives to their families. Every working man, in Schueller’s view, 					needed a wife waiting for him at home. Especially when work was scarce, he 					thought women had a duty not to compete with men: they should resign their jobs 					and look after their many children. “A home, for a man, means a wife at home, 					and if every member of the family over fourteen has to work for a living, it 					isn’t a real home.”38 Older men would cultivate 					the gardens, and help the women with household tasks and crafts. Artists and 					craftsmen were also accommodated in this worldview, their artifacts adding to 					the pleasure of life.

				Under Schueller’s system, poverty would be 					eliminated. So, too, would enormous wealth. Schueller admitted that getting rich 					was a not insignificant motivation in business, but in the end “we all have the 					same pen, the same telephone, the same radio, we’ll all have more or less the 					same fridge, the same car, the same mattress, the same sheets—and anyway,” he 					grumbled, like Helena Rubinstein indignant that such a large proportion of his 					rightful earnings should be confiscated by an ungrateful state, “there’s not 					much left once you’ve paid your taxes.”39 					Running a business was, rather, about reinvestment and development, and he had 					definite ideas about that.

				First, it was important that employers personally 					own their concerns. They must be allowed to take risks and go broke from time to 					time—for Schueller, risk-taking was what being a successful industrialist was 					all about—and shareholders would always vote for income over investment, 					rejecting risk on the pretext that “it all works fine as it is.” (L’Oréal 					remained a private company throughout its founder’s lifetime, going public only 					in 1963, six years after Schueller’s death.) Banks’ money was especially to be 					avoided, since banks were particularly risk-averse.5 So were those 					who owned a business through inheritance. Schueller thoroughly disapproved of 					businesses being inherited. The fact that so many of France’s businesses were 					dynastic was, he thought, a great weakness. Not only did it entrench social 					immobility, it had left the country economically underdeveloped—to the point, 					indeed, where even Schueller felt France’s most important resource was her 						land;6 her industries relied for survival on 					tariffs and cartels.

				Above all, Schueller felt that being an employer 					was about social responsibility. He offered his own experience as an example of 					the kind of management vision needed. In 1936, he had mechanized one of his 					factories, and two years later production had risen 34 percent, using 11 percent 					less in the way of manpower. Each sacked worker represented 12 francs a day 					saved, but 15 percent of those let go were unable to find another job, and to 					those he continued to pay 10 francs a day out of this saving. He also paid 					monthly supplements to his workers’ families, 100 francs for the first child, 50 					francs for the second, 200 francs to mothers who stayed home rather than going 					out to work. Motherhood was a social service: big families were essential if 					France was to be repopulated following the carnage of World War I.40 He hoped such practices would become 					widespread. All that was needed to achieve the revolution was a handful of 					strong-minded men like himself. If they persevered, they would prevail.

				To connoisseurs of twentieth-century self-made men, 					all this will sound oddly familiar. A dynamic employer who rises from poverty to 					create a new industry through his own outstanding technical and commercial 					abilities, and who then uses part of his profits to create a kind of 					self-contained mini-state in which to impose his idea of how things should 					be—such a man already, and famously, existed. Schueller’s trajectory, so rare in 					France, would have raised no eyebrows in America. And his hero was indeed 					American—the automobile magnate Henry Ford. Ford, like Schueller, directed some 					of his profits into social services—housing, schooling, hospitals—for the 					families of his workers. Like Schueller, he was concerned that these subventions 					should be used properly—that is, used as Ford thought best. Like Schueller he 					was a political idealist, the idealism, in his case, taking the form of 					pacifism. (In 1915, his Peace Ship initiative tried vainly to bring World War I 					to an end.) And, like Schueller, he had an economic dada—in Ford’s case, the five-dollar day, his aim being to ensure 					that every one of his workers could afford to buy one of his cars.

				When Ford instituted the five-dollar day in 1914, 					it seemed like an act of reckless generosity. In fact it paid for itself 					handsomely as higher wages led to better health and morale, and hence increased 					production. But it was not, in practice, as straightforward as it sounded. You 						could earn five dollars a day, if you worked 					uncomplainingly on the production lines Ford had built and led the kind of life 					he thought you should lead: not smoking or drinking (Ford did neither), and 					putting some of your money into savings. Ford created a Sociological Department 					to educate and inspect his workers, and decide how much each man should be 					awarded. You didn’t have to be a respectably married nonsmoking teetotaller to 					work at Ford’s. But you wouldn’t earn five dollars a day unless you were, any 					more than Schueller’s workers would see their share of profits until their 					families were certified as living “properly.”

				Schueller was a great admirer of Ford, and his 					economic and social theories were heavily influenced by Fordism.41 And Fordism led to a particular kind of 					politics. Unlike most businessmen, whose interest in their workers ceased once 					they had left the plant, Ford and Schueller’s form of extended paternalism 					effectively turned their businesses into mini–welfare states. And in the chaotic 					world of the 1920s and thirties, it seemed logical that what worked for their 					businesses might also work in the wider political arena.

				Ford first dipped his toes into political waters in 					1918. He ran for the United States Senate, as a Democrat, but was defeated in a 					viciously corrupt campaign. In 1923 there was talk of drafting him to run for 					president. But he hated public speaking so much, and was so bad at it, that 					after his one and only failed attempt at a political rally, he determined never 					again to risk a comparable humiliation. “I can hire someone to talk for me that 					knows how,” he said. “That talking thing is a gift. I’m glad I never acquired 					it, and I’ll never try again.”42 Nor did he 					need to. Why humiliate himself at the hustings when he could practice his 					theories upon a captive audience and a captive population?

				Untrammeled by the need to accommodate public 					opinion, what had begun as a benign dictatorship soon changed into something 					altogether unpleasant. Ford’s Sociological Department, begun in a genuine spirit 					of philanthropy, was after a few years replaced by a Service Department, which 					sounded equally altruistic but whose function was very different. Set up to 					coordinate the protection of the plant, the Service Department soon transmuted 					into a network of spies, informers, and enforcers who terrorized the Ford 					factories and suppressed all dissent. Labor organizers were beaten, strikes were 					broken brutally, protesters were sacked: one ex-member of the Service Department 					referred to it as “our Gestapo.”743 					Indeed, Hitler was a fervent admirer of Ford. Mein 						Kampf was written with Ford’s autobiography, My 						Life and Times, and philosophy—“an absence of fear of the future and 					of veneration of the past”—much in mind.8

				Schueller, too, was an unashamed authoritarian: as 					he put it, “An elected leader is already less of a leader.” 44 He thought democracy should mean government 						for all, but not by 					all. Running a modern state was too difficult to be left to anyone the masses 					might choose.45 However, when it came down to 					picking actual men, he showed himself to be somewhat uncertain. The list of 					leaders he admired included Stalin, Mussolini, Franco, Hitler, Horthy, Atatürk, 					Pilsudski, Roosevelt, Chamberlain, and Daladier—that is, pretty much every 					available one, elected or otherwise. From which we can only conclude that the 					mere fact of making it to the top was evidence, as far as he was concerned, of 					the right stuff. Similarly, although he did not at this stage think France 					should ally herself with Germany—on the contrary, his great concern was the 					unpreparedness of the French army—as a committed authoritarian he could not help 					admiring Hitler’s style. Hitler hadn’t pandered to the trade unions with a New 					Deal like Roosevelt in the United States, or with a forty-hour week and 					unemployment pay like Léon Blum in France. Instead, he had taken all the men he 					could get hold of and put them to work, creating a formidable military power. 					France, Schueller felt, should do likewise. Nevertheless, despite his dislike 					and distrust of the unions (a dislike wholeheartedly reciprocated), he continued 					to employ union men, and did not persecute them as Ford did.

				Of course Schueller and Ford were not alone in 					being attracted by the idea of dictatorship. They were probably unique, outside 					the ranks of politicians, in actually running, to a greater or lesser extent, 					their own state; but as the broke and dithering thirties limped on, many 					idealists with no personal experience of power were attracted by the capacity 					for unimpeded action that dictatorship seemed to offer. “I am asking for a 					Liberal Fascisti, for enlightened Nazis,” declared H. G. Wells, addressing the 					Oxford Union in 1932, still, despite all the evidence, apparently believing that 					a benign dictatorship was not an oxymoron. “The world is sick of parliamentary 					democracy. The fascist party is Italy. The Communist is Russia. The Fascists of 					liberation must carry out a parallel ambition on a far grander scale.”

				With hindsight, Wells’s call seems extraordinarily 					naive. But it was a true expression of his personal creed, which managed to 					combine socialism with unambiguous elitism. Many of his novels—The Time Machine, A Modern Utopia, The New Machiavelli, 						Anticipations—envisaged worlds ruled by a special governing order of 					the best and the brightest. And Wells was not alone in this seemingly 					incompatible combination of beliefs: this was the generation of socialists who 					embraced the new “science” of eugenics—but who were appalled when those theories 					were actually translated into action.

				It is tempting—though probably false—to wonder 					whether eugenic considerations partly explain the fascist sympathies of Europe’s 					beauty tycoons. The perfumier François Coty famously backed the far-right 					Faisceau and Croix de Feu movements during the 1930s, and a little later founded 					the infamous paramilitary group Solidarité Française; Coco Chanel was a renowned 					horizontal collaborator. Eugenics, after all, did identify physical 					beauty—which, for these Europeans, naturally meant Caucasian beauty—as a 					prerequisite for most other desirable qualities. As the then-celebrated American 					psychologist Knight Dunlap put it in 1920, “All dark races prefer white 						skin.”46

				In his book Personal Beauty 						and Racial Betterment, Dunlap, who, inter 						alia, saw baldness as a sign of physical degeneration—“It is 					difficult to conceive of a baldheaded musical genius or artist”47—pointed the way, twenty years before the 					event, to notions of the Untermensch and the Final Solution. “Perhaps there are 					limits beyond which the preservation of the individual is undesirable. It seems 					not only useless but dangerous to preserve the incurably insane and the lower 					grades of the feeble-minded.”48

				Dunlap was not alone in these thoughts. Similar 					theories were commonplace among psychologists at the time, some of whom had 					little hesitation in acting upon them when they could with impunity. Their use 					of inmates in American state hospitals as fodder for experimentation during the 					1920s and thirties has become notorious. If fascism is the absolute subjection 					of the individual to the needs of the state, as defined by the ruling 					dictatorship, then those psychologists—absolute dictators in their own 					realm—were undoubtedly fascists. And if—as after World War II—culpability is 					graded along a scale of readiness to eradicate undesirable individuals, with 					Hitler at one end and, say, H. G. Wells at the other, then Dunlap and his ilk 					would probably not have survived a Nuremberg.

				Most of those who held these views, however, lay at 					some point between these two extremes. In those cases, the matter of gradation 					could become a question of crucial personal concern. And one of these cases 					would be Eugène Schueller.

				What Did You Do in the 						War, Daddy?




I

				Our readers are true Frenchwomen. They are worried 					and sad. That’s only natural. But sadness is not the same as losing heart. No 					one, in France, should lose heart. . . . Not to care about your 					appearance shows a lack of courage. Beauty is a discipline, and it’s cowardly to 					reject it.

				—Votre 						Beauté, NOVEMBER 1940

				In 1939, 					the year World War II broke out, Eugène Schueller was fifty-eight. Small, shy, 					rotund, full of a disarming nervous enthusiasm, his words tripping over each 					other in a vain attempt to keep up with his ideas, he had, Merry Bromberger 					remarked, “the candid eyes and hesitant manner of Charlie Chaplin. 					. . . [His] curls, whether permed or natural, have survived fifty 					years of experiments. . . . When people say chemicals are not good for 					the hair, the great hair chemist need only show his own froth of little 						waves.”1 Those waves were now an odd violet 					tint that suggested frequent use of his own products.

				Those products had bought him the grandest possible 					lifestyle. He had built himself two houses, the villa at L’Arcouest, where he 					relaxed, and an imposing pile at Franconville, just northwest of Paris, 					surrounded by elaborate terraced gardens—a highly impractical venture, he 					observed ruefully: seven servants and seven gardeners were needed to keep it up 					properly, and he liked to complain, somewhat hyperbolically, that the taxes he 					so bitterly resented paying meant he would never be left with enough to run it 					as it should be run. There was also a luxurious Paris apartment, on avenue 					Suchet, overlooking the Bois de Boulogne. And now a new war threatened, and who 					knew where he, and France, would be left at the end of it?

				Unlike Henry Ford, whose enthusiasm for Hitler 					(including generous financial support) was rewarded in 1938 by the Grand Cross 					of the German Eagle, Schueller spent the prewar years warning his countrymen 					against the German “wolf” and the dangers it threatened. General mobilization 					and the ramping-up of war industries had at least averted the open civil war 					that had threatened France earlier in the decade, getting the economy moving and 					solving the problem of mass unemployment. But he saw that France was no match 					for Germany. Unless Britain sent 300,000 men and 5,000 aircraft, and the United 					States the same, all would be lost.2

				The Ministry of Defense was more sanguine, or more 					fatalistic. Its response to the impending threat was to extend the so-called 					Maginot Line of concrete fortifications and tank traps built after World War I 					to prevent any new German incursion (and to provide its defenders with munitions 					that in many cases were the wrong size for the guns).3 Few people thought it would work. As a gamekeeper on his father’s 					land near the Belgian border observed to the young François Dalle (later to 					become L’Oréal’s managing director), “You know as well as I do, Franchot, that 					the Maginot line won’t stop the Germans. They’ll go through Holland like they 					did last time.” 4

				They did just that, in a furious attack launched on 					May 10, 1940, through Holland and Belgium. By May 26 the French were in retreat 					and the British Expeditionary Force, sent to support them, had been driven back 					to Dunkirk beach. During the following week over 338,000 British, French, and 					Canadian troops were evacuated across the Channel, under constant German fire. 					On June 14 the Germans entered Paris, declared an open city to avoid 					bombardment; on June 17 Marshal Pétain, whose troops had triumphed over the 					Germans at Verdun twenty-five years before, ordered the French army to stop 					fighting; and on June 22 he signed the armistice, under the terms of which 					two-thirds of France would be occupied by Germany.

				Although in the immediate aftermath of the invasion 					ten million panicked French citizens took to the roads, eventually most of them 					trickled back home and tried to take up the threads of their lives. Many put 					their faith in Pétain, who at least offered the promise of a French rather than 					a German government, and made themselves inconspicuous in hopes that the 					occupying authorities would leave them alone. The more defiant retreated into 					sullen noncooperation or more active resistance. A core of diehard nationalists 					and furious young men joined de Gaulle in London. And at the other end of the 					political spectrum, some actively welcomed the new German rulers: among them, 					prompted by a mix of practical necessity, economic evangelism, and political 					ambition, Eugène Schueller.

				A good many French businessmen of the time were, 					like Schueller, interested in social reform. Several thought, as he did, that a 					benign dictatorship—the equivalent of H. G. Wells’s “enlightened Nazis”—was the 					only efficient mode of government. One of these, Ariste Potton, wrote a novel on 					this subject in 1937 in which he set out his countrymen’s (and his own) 					psychological position: “The Frenchman wants to be free,” he declared, “but he’s 					happy to accept discipline, if he has confidence in the person in charge.”5 Potton’s fictional businessman, clearly a 					wishful self-portrait, is loved by his workers, whom he’s always treated 					well—something on which Schueller, too, prided himself. Unlike Potton, however, 					who left the question of his leader’s actual political standpoint unelaborated 					(he simply brings “social progress and economic revival” to France and peace to 					Europe) Schueller did not mince his words. “Need I say, I believe in an 					authoritarian state, properly led, and that I consider it impossible to build a 					representative state based on universal liberty and equality? . . . 					Everyone must realize that many are his superiors and deserve more than he. Life 					is about opportunity. Everyone must have his chance, and not try to deprive 					others of what he hasn’t got himself.”6

				In this state of inferiors and superiors, Schueller 					was in no doubt as to his own position. The merest handful of men, so long as 					they were true revolutionaries, would be enough, he thought, to change a 					nation’s fate.7 Postwar France would badly need 					such men—“what these days are called ‘Führers of the professions’ ”8—and Eugène Schueller would be one of them, 					hopefully as finance minister in whatever French government would replace the 					Germans when they left. He therefore set himself to acquire the skills without 					which success in politics is impossible. He was not a natural orator and was 					determined not to repeat the experience of Henry Ford. He engaged a private 					speech tutor to visit him every morning, and fitted out one of the rue Royale 					rooms as a small auditorium, where he could try out speeches on a few friends 					before risking himself in front of a wider public. And at the same time he 					looked around for a political group that would make a suitable vehicle for his 					ideas.

				Schueller’s decision to throw in his lot with the 					Germans was governed more by pragmatism than doctrine. An engineer hired by him 					during the war, and who made it clear he did not wish to work even indirectly 					for the Germans, reported that Schueller “saw my point of view.” But “he said he 					thought the Germans were very strong, and better organized, while the other side 					seemed completely without organization. It was just a social conversation 					. . . and I have to say, I think M. Schueller is too much of an 					opportunist to risk engaging himself absolutely in favor of anyone.”9

				In fact, there was more than mere opportunism to 					Schueller’s vocal welcome of the invaders. The Occupation solved a dilemma that 					had long frustrated him: that although Hitler’s new order corresponded 					remarkably closely to his own long-held visions, Hitler himself was 					unfortunately the enemy. Had that not been so, France would now be in a far 					better state. “We haven’t been as lucky as the Nazis, who came to power in 					1933,” he would write in La Révolution de 					l’économie, published in 1941 by Guillemot et Delamotte, whose list was 					headed by the collected speeches of Adolf Hitler. But now, at last, the years of 					stasis were over. Finally, the French people would realize that only a complete 					transformation could save them; and then all the suffering—“the war, the defeat, 					the destruction of our armies, an entire nation in flight”10—would not have been in vain.

				Although almost all enthusiastic collaborators 					would have agreed, most had arrived there by a very different route. Schueller 					was a pragmatist. But for his future allies, fascism’s attraction lay in 					doctrine rather than practicalities. By no means all were pro-German. But the 					Germans had achieved something they had long hoped for: the destruction of the 					hated Republic—la gueuse (the beggarwoman), as they 					disdainfully referred to it.

				Nor did they find any problem with other aspects of 					Nazi philosophy, such as anti-Semitism. Most had begun political life as 					followers of Action Française, the right-wing nationalist pressure group that 					had arisen out of the Dreyfus affair, and which advocated that the unfortunate 					Captain Dreyfus should not be pardoned even though he had been proven innocent, 					and that his accusers should not be charged with perjury. That would tarnish the 					honor of the French army—something rather more important than an injustice meted 					out to a mere Jew. For them, Jews and Freemasons not only represented the 					sinister forces of international capital and secularism that had imposed 					themselves on France at the time of the Revolution, but threatened, by their 					alien culture, everything that made France special.

				This toxic mix of xenophobic nationalism, Catholic 					fundamentalism, and fascinated envy was summed up by Henry Charbonneau, who 					would for a while become one of Schueller’s political colleagues:

				In every walk of 						life—political, economic, artistic, intellectual—the Jews were 						disproportionately prominent. Some professions were effectively under their 						control. It was truly a state within a state. . . . Personally, 						I’ve always felt defensive about this tentacular Jewish influence. Not that 						I’ve actually known many Jews, but they’ve always interested me. I was one 						of the first to see The Dybbuk when it was put on at the Théâtre 						Montparnasse in 1931. And later, when I was studying the culture of 						Andalusia, I really loved digging into the writings of the great Jewish 						savants of the Caliphate and Cordoba. . . . So it isn’t that I had 						anything against Judaism as such, but what always got under my skin was the 						notion that . . . you couldn’t really be talented, intelligent, 						witty, or even courageous unless you were a Jew or had Jewish friends. How 						could I bear to see intellectual and political life taken over by a minority 						many of whom weren’t even properly assimilated yet? 11

				For Schueller, who had once been a Freemason and 					who had many Jewish colleagues, these obsessions played little if any part in 					his thinking. He disliked the Republic not because he looked back nostalgically 					to the days of a Catholic monarchy but because, as he never tired of repeating, 					he was an authoritarian. For a man convinced that “Everyone’s first duty, 					whether boss, employee, or civil servant, is to obey,”12 the wave of strikes that paralyzed France in 1936 had been a 					glimpse into a terrifying future. His main objection to Léon Blum, who ended 					this situation by caving in to many of the unions’ demands, was his socialism, 					not his Judaism. The formulaic phrase, compulsory for all right-wing orators, 					about freeing France from “la franc-maçonnerie et la juiverie,” appeared only 					once in Schueller’s speeches and writings, when he used it to underline the need 					to make a complete break with the failed Third Republic—an institution with 					which, in the circles he was addressing, that phrase was conventionally 						associated.13

				For Schueller, as for many industrialists, the new 					Europe essentially meant a new economic order, neither French nor German but 					“mixte.” They had long hoped for a breaking down of economic boundaries—as 					Schueller put it in La Révolution de l’économie, “a 					day when the mark and the franc would be one monetary unity in a European 						economy.”14 For years that had been a pipe 					dream: but if the Germans won, it would be the future. And if one thought this 					way, collaboration was a logical way forward.

				And this was not just a question of theory. At the 					most fundamental level, it was the only way to stay in business. The war years 					were very profitable for those who could keep manufacturing—anything that could 					be made could be sold, the occupiers would pay any price for luxuries, and there 					was a flourishing black market in scarce necessities. But only collaboration 					ensured access to raw materials.15 Later, 					Schueller would argue that he did only the minimum business with the enemy, but 					L’Oréal’s profits quadrupled between 1940 and 1944, and Monsavon’s doubled. He 					must have been selling something, in quantity; and it hadn’t been manufactured 					out of air.

				Part of this may be put down to ingenuity. Most 					industrialists, Schueller scornfully pointed out, were not good at making do. 					Despite a law making it compulsory to recycle scarce substances, they found it 					impossible to operate without their usual quantities of basic materials. 					Schueller, by contrast, tried wherever possible to use substitutes. Before the 					war, Monsavon soaps had contained 72 percent fats; during it, only 20 percent. 					The quality, admittedly, was less good—but people didn’t complain: anything was 					better than nothing.16 Even inferior materials 					had nonetheless to be sourced somewhere. And there was inevitably a price to 					pay. The Germans demanded not just that French manufacturers supply them, but 					that shares in French companies be transferred to German hands.

				For manufacturers commited to the idea of a 					Franco-German community, however, this transfer of assets presented no problem. 					Rather it made sound economic sense. A mixte economy 					required mixte management. An investigative 					commission set up in the Lyon region in 1945 found “no trace of forcing” by 					Vichy or the Germans in this respect. On the contrary, when, as happened from 					time to time, Vichy tried to prevent such moves, the businessmen generally 					managed to get around the prohibition. “They say now that resistance, in 1940 					and 1941, would have been premature and useless,” the commission reported. “But 					the question . . . never really arose for the bosses of finance and 					industry. . . . It simply didn’t concern them. . . . 					Resistance seemed absurd and pointless—a fight against themselves.”17

				Naturally, little if any of this was ever stated in 					so many words. When the occupation ended, and Schueller was tried for industrial 					collaboration, he was asked about his paint firm Valentine, whose product was of 					course of considerable interest to the occupiers, and which appeared to have 					sold them a good proportion of what it made. Schueller simply replied that he 					was no longer in charge there at the time. He had relinquished his majority 					holding, along with his position as Valentine’s CEO, in October 1940. What he 					did not say was that Valentine was closely involved with the German firm 					Druckfarben, and helped it take control of another French paint firm, Neochrome, 					in which Valentine had a 50-percent holding. Valentine (and thus Schueller) 					ceded 15 perent of its Neochrome holdings to the Germans, and as a 					“participation française” was necessary, retained the remaining 35 percent. 						. . .18 The German in charge of 					this transaction was a Dr. Schmilinsky. He valued his acquaintance with 					Schueller and went out of his way to introduce this “eminent industrial chemist 					and an eminent and ardent partisan of the Franco-German accord,” to his 					superiors in the German embassy.19

				Dr. Schmilinsky also described Schueller as being 					head of the economic section of a political party. For he had now made his 					choice. He would offer his services—and his money—to the Mouvement Sociale 					Révolutionnaire (MSR—which, in the French pronunciation, emerges as “Aime et 					Sers,” or Love and Serve—an acronym we shall encounter frequently in the 					following pages).

				MSR were the most extreme of the extreme. They were 					led by Eugène Deloncle, a clever and charismatic naval engineer whose hypnotic 					personal charm nullified his somewhat absurd appearance—short, plump, invariably 					bowler-hatted—and kept his inner circle spellbound. Deloncle, who operated under 					the nom-de-guerre of “Monsieur Marie,” was a plotter and intriguer; his favorite 					reading was Malaparte’s Technique of the 					Coup-d’état. Ultranationalist and deeply anti-German, he was nevertheless 					convinced that, given the fait accompli of the Occupation, collaboration was a 					“biological necessity” if France was to become, as he hoped, an independent 					fascist state.20 “The first priority for France 					is to collaborate. Why is she wasting so much time?” he demanded in a radio 					broadcast in January 1941.21

				Deloncle had been spurred into independent 					political action by the failure of the great antigovernment demonstration of 					February 6, 1934. Ever since 1789, French politics had been dominated by the 					never-resolved conflict between those who supported the Revolution and those who 					were against everything it stood for. For the antis, who included many if not 					most of the governing and officer class, this February day represented the last 					best chance of overturning the hated Republic. Forty thousand supporters of the 					royalist right—Charles Maurras’s Action Française and its youth wing, the 					Camelots du Roy; Colonel de la Rocque’s ultra-Catholic Croix de Feu; the fascist 					Solidarité Française; and the Jeunes Patriotes—gathered in the Place de la 					Concorde to march on the Chamber of Deputies in the Palais-Bourbon, on the other 					side of the Seine. For more than a month the rhetoric had been building. The 					climate of insurrection had reached the boiling point; the time had come for 					action.

				By the end of the day, sixteen were dead and a 					thousand wounded, including four hundred police. But at the crucial moment La 					Rocque, whose Croix de Feu were massed in a vital passage from where they could 					have overwhelmed the garde républicaine, called off 					his troops. He had decided that as a serving officer he could not march on the 					Chamber of Deputies. None of the other factions had either the men or the arms 					to act without him. The Republic was saved, and in the 1936 elections, a huge 					left-wing majority swept Léon Blum and his Popular Front to power.

				There was general gnashing of right-wing teeth, but 					for some, gnashing was not enough. In February 1936, Blum was attacked by Jean 					Filliol, the little killer who would become Deloncle’s hit man. On his way back 					from a meeting, Blum’s car had got caught up in the funeral cortege of a popular 					royalist historian. Filliol, who was attending the funeral, noticed it and 					seized his opportunity. He broke the car’s window, sank a bayonet into its 					backseat, and was preparing to sink it into Blum himself when workers from a 					nearby building site rescued the prime minister, who eventually found refuge in 					the nearby headquarters of the League of Catholic Women. Blum was bloodied and 					terrified but still alive. That June, he dissolved the right-wing ligues, making 					them illegal.

				Deloncle, always attracted by the clandestine, 					thereupon decided to set up his own secret army: the Organisme spécial de l’action régulatrice nationale, or OSARN. It 					was more commonly known as La Cagoule, “the hood”—an epithet referring to the 					Klan-type red hoods supposedly worn when members were inducted, and soon 					generally adopted. These chosen shock troops would be a French fascist party in 					embryo, and would counter what Deloncle dubbed “inaction française.” He 					organized them along the lines of the secret societies that perennially 					fascinated him, even when (as with the Freemasons) he hated them. Potential 					members were vetted. They needed a reliable “godfather” to vouch for them, and 					were allotted to separate cells that knew only their own members and doings, and 					that operated under names with anodyne and vaguely patriotic associations, 					different in every region. Connections between the center and the regions were 					kept indirect. Army officers received what was in effect a contract, promising 					protection in exchange for their support. And “traitors” were pitilessly 					executed. “Nous sommes méchants,” Deloncle liked to 					say—something Filliol made sure was no idle boast.

				The proper equipment of this organization would 					require funds. Deloncle obtained signed letters of endorsement from the aged 					Marshal Franchet d’Espèrey, France’s most senior soldier, and set about raising 					them. Many of France’s biggest businessmen—Lafarge cement, the Byrrh and 					Cointreau liqueur interests, Ripolin paints, several of the big Protestant 					banks, the Lesieur cooking-oils magnate Lemaigre-Dubreuil—were sufficiently 					terrified by the looming specter of communism to fill his coffers. Louis Renault 					donated two million francs; Pierre Michelin gave a million, and sent another 					three and a half million in cash, in a briefcase. The Michelin tire empire was 					based in Clermont-Ferrand, in the Auvergne; the local branch of La Cagoule was 					composed entirely of Michelin engineers, placed by their employer at Deloncle’s 					disposal. Soon Deloncle’s organization had ten thousand members, among them many 					senior army officers.

				They at once set about their business. When 					Franchet d’Espèrey demanded a “blood proof” before raising any more money, it 					was provided in the shape of Dmitri Navachine, the Soviet representative in 					Paris, who in addition to being a Communist was a Jew and a Freemason, thus 					ticking all the hate boxes of the right. Filliol murdered Navachine in his 					trademark way—shot, then finished off with a dagger—while the diplomat was out 					walking his dogs in the Bois de Boulogne on January 24, 1937.

				Other murders followed. On March 16, 1937, a La 					Cagoule commando fired missiles into a socialist demonstration in Clichy, a 					working-class district of Paris. In June, in exchange for machine guns from 					Mussolini, the Italian socialist Carlo Rosselli was assassinated, along with his 					brother, Nello, in the quiet Normandy spa of Bagnoles de l’Orne: “the sad death 					in exile that seems almost inevitable for the best sons of Italy,” as Rosselli 					himself wrote of another Italian socialist (Filippo Turati) who had suffered a 					similar fate. The police solved none of these crimes: the details did not emerge 					until La Cagoule was finally brought to trial after the Liberation.

				On September 11, 1937, Deloncle overreached 					himself. At ten that evening, in a coup organized by Filliol and a team that 					included a Michelin engineer, two bombs exploded in Paris near the Arc de 					Triomphe. One destroyed the façade of the rue de Presbourg offices of the 					Confédération Générale du Patronat Français (the general confederation of French 					employers), raising a cloud a hundred meters high and blowing over a nearby 					taxi. The second destroyed the building of the iron and steel manufacturers’ 					association at 45, rue Boissière. Two people were killed and many more injured. 					Deloncle spread rumors, propagated by the right-wing press, that this attack was 					the work of Communist plotters. The police had infiltrated La Cagoule and soon 					began to unravel what had happened, but Deloncle’s numerous supporters in the 					army all believed in the Communist plot, their fears further fanned by a new 					Deloncle rumor, this time that a Communist takeover had been planned and was 					imminent. It was agreed that they would descend on Paris, avert the danger, and 					take over. The night of November 15–16 was fixed for the operation and assembly 					points arranged at four addresses where La Cagoule had established arms dumps: 					in a pension de famille for elderly ladies, an 					antiques shop, a radiography center, and a villa in the suburb of Rueil where 					the basement had been fitted up as a torture chamber. Unfortunately for the 					plotters, the police were waiting, arrested those cagoulards unable to escape in 					time, and confiscated the arms. Deloncle and his brother were picked up, as were 					a number of others, including, sensationally, a general—Duseigneur—and a duke, 					who held the Corsican title of Pozzo di Borgo. They were held in prison awaiting 					trial. When war was declared, however, the cagoulards were provisionally freed 					to join—or rejoin—the armed forces. And after the German triumph, they went 					their different ways.

				Supporting La Cagoule did not mean that you 					automatically supported the occupying Germans. On the contrary, many, especially 					among army officers, were proud nationalists. They had been unable to bear the 					spectacle of their beloved France mismanaged by a leftist rabble, and now found 					the thought of a teutonic hegemony equally intolerable. Some followed de Gaulle 					to London; others supported General Giraud, who had been an active cagoulard 					while governor of Metz, and who became a rival focus for resistance. Several 					joined Pétain in Vichy, where an increasingly vain pretense of independence was 					maintained. But a hard core, including Filliol, chose out-and-out collaboration. 					They followed Deloncle to Paris, becoming the MSR.

				For Deloncle, the debacle offered the prospect of a 					dazzling revenge as the hated Republic was destroyed, along with its “puppets.” 					“I witnessed their agony,” he wrote to his wife. “If you could have seen their 					faces, masks of terror, sweating dishonor, you’d have hugged yourself with 						joy.”22 Now he, whom they had forced into 					hiding and imprisoned, would prepare to take power. But to do so he would need 					money, and Schueller offered it.

				Schueller said he first met Deloncle at the end of 1940, “when he came 					to find me and said he was utterly converted to my social and economic ideas, 					which he wanted to include in his party’s program.”23 In fact, many historians claim he was the secret financier behind 					La Cagoule, in which case they would have met much earlier. But there seems to 					be no evidence—other than the historians’ assertions—to support that. La 					Cagoule’s finances were not secret, at least within cagoulard circles; nor did 					Schueller’s name appear on the carelessly uncoded list of members kept by La 					Cagoule’s archivist, Aristide Corre, and found by the police when they searched 					his rooms five days after the Arc de Triomphe bombs. The list was sketchy 					regarding the provinces, but was clear and full as far as Paris membership was 					concerned, giving all members’ names and addresses.

				When the new party was born, on September 15, 1940, 					describing itself as “European, racist, revolutionary, communitarian [i.e., 					Franco-German in outlook], authoritarian,” Schueller was the first member to 					sign up (the second was Filliol).24 On the new 					party’s letterhead, where his name appeared just below that of Eugène Deloncle, 					he was named as “president and director of technical commissions and study 					committees.” As well as money, he gave the MSR a meeting room adjacent to his 					own luxurious offices in the L’Oréal building on rue Royale.25 In return, a nod to the proportional salary 					was included in the MSR manifesto of aims. Alongside the standard racist and 					nationalist clichés that Deloncle took so chillingly literally (“We want to 					construct the new Europe in co-operation with National Socialist Germany and all 					the other European nations liberated, as she has been, from liberal capitalism, 					Judaism, Bolshevism, and Freemasonry. . . . The racial regeneration of 					France and the French . . . Severe racial laws to prevent such Jews as 					remain in France from polluting the French race . . . We want to 					create a united, virile and strong youth . . .”) there was a promise 					“To create a socialist economy that will assure a fair distribution of goods by 					raising salaries along with production.”26

				What all this meant varied according to one’s point 					of view. When the young engineer Georges Soulès (later to become known as 					Raymond Abellio, a writer on the occult) visited MSR headquarters for the first 					time, he noticed with some amusement that Deloncle, “so warm, voluble, full of 					charm and Gascon verve,” and who spoke so spontaneously and enthusiastically 					when he was discussing his militias and their doings, only mentioned 					Schueller—whom he referred to as “our future minister of the national economy, 					the most important man in the movement”—at the end of their conversation, as an 						afterthought.27

				The truth, of course, was that what mattered to 					Deloncle was Schueller’s money. Indulgence of his economic ideas was the price 					that had to be paid for it. But if Schueller recognized this (later he said, “No 					doubt Deloncle knew how passionate I felt, and how easy it would be to use me as 					a front man in certain industrial circles if he flattered me”28), it was of little importance. All that 					mattered was that his ideas be propagated and, eventually, implemented. And why 					not through the charismatic and energetic Deloncle?

				Other right-wing politicians could see plenty of 					reasons why not. The prospect of Schueller’s money being made available to this 					crazed fanatic terrified them—so much so that in 1940, General de La Laurencie, 					Pétain’s then representative in the Occupied Zone, sent his nephew to try to 					persuade Schueller to moderate his support for the MSR.29 But Schueller stuck with Deloncle. Part of the attraction, Soulès 					said, was that Deloncle was an engineer, not a professional politician. Like 					Schueller himself, he was a new and energetic force amid the professors, 					lawyers, and old soldiers who generally cluttered the political scene.

				Schueller’s defense, when he later had to try to 					justify his actions, was that he had been misunderstood and misled—that, in the 					words of his daughter, Liliane, “He was a pathological optimist who hadn’t the 					first idea about politics, and who always managed to be in the wrong 						place.”30 That, though, was not convincing. 					It was hard to believe that a person who had made such a huge success in the 					cutthroat world of business could be quite such an innocent. On the other hand, 					his decision to associate himself with a murderous fantasist like Deloncle threw 					serious doubts on his political judgment. No one familiar with Deloncle’s 					cagoulard past, with its melodramatic plots and bloody assassinations, could 					have imagined the MSR would ever form a government.

				Perhaps the explanation is that the past, even the 					recent past, had no interest for Schueller. A true Fordist in this respect, his 					sole concern was to select the most efficient route to the desired future. 					Having picked the MSR as his route, and with his blind faith in the power of his 					economic ideas, perhaps he truly thought he could promote a coherent political 					program within it—that, in Soulès’ words, it “would take on new colors, and an 					intelligent game would become possible, Deloncle’s personal game reduced, 					channeled, made wise, by the application of systems and ideas.”31 If he did think this way, however, he had 					misread his man. Deloncle was happy to tolerate intellectuals, but only so long 					as they confined themselves strictly to cultural activities.32 He, and only he, would dictate the action.

				In 					February 1941, Otto Abetz, the German ambassador to Paris, pressed the MSR to 					combine with Marcel Déat’s far larger Rassemblement Nationale Populaire (RNP) to 					maximize their power and influence. As Abetz perhaps foresaw, it was not a 					natural meeting of minds. Déat was an old pacifist and socialist who had been 					part of the Front Populaire. He had bitterly opposed France’s entry into this 					war, which he saw as a British plot to further its imperial interests, and had 					worked his way across the political spectrum to become a pro-German 					national-socialist. He thus embodied everything that the anti-German, 					right-wing, bellicose Deloncle most loathed. At the RNP, Soulès noted, “one was 					received in a quiet, discreetly elegant salon that might have belonged to a 					studious professor who had suddenly become famous; at the MSR the anteroom was a 					closed guardroom, entirely military, with no trace of politics.”33 Indeed, the MSR had acquired smart new 					paramilitary uniforms, with khaki shirts, cross-belts, breeches, and black boots 					and gloves, in which they continued to stalk their enemies just as in the glory 					days of La Cagoule.

				Deloncle agreed to Abetz’s arrangement—he could 					hardly have done otherwise. But, as always, there was a plot. He would take over 					the RNP from within, à la Cagoule, beginning, in the 					classic manner, by assassinating several Déatists. When these assassinations 					happened, Déat himself was in the hospital. A former secretary of Deloncle’s, a 					Mme. Massé, went to visit him there. A few days later, she too was killed and 					her body found in the Seine. She may have shown Déat some documents proving that 					Deloncle, his supposed ally, had been behind the assassinations, or perhaps 					simply wanted to warn him that Deloncle planned to use his absence in the 					hospital to take over the RNP. Either way, the visit proved fatal. An attempt 					was made, some time later, on Déat himself. It failed. But Marx Dormoy, who had 					once been Déat’s colleague in the Front Populaire, and who was now under house 					arrest in Montélimar, was blown up in his bed that July. Dormoy had been 					minister of the interior at the time of the Arc de Triomphe bombs and had 					overseen the arrest and imprisonment of the cagoulards. They had not 						forgotten—“nous sommes méchants”’—and this was 					their revenge.

				Not surprisingly, morale in the wider RNP 					plummeted. Its membership had expanded during the early weeks of the enforced 					cohabitation, but soon fell into an irreversible decline. For Schueller, so 					accustomed to success, this was his first real experience of failure. “I’ve 					never known a man able to inspire so much confidence in a movement, so long as 					he was in charge,” Soulès observed.34 But now 					he was not in charge, and MSR no longer inspired confidence. Was it a good idea 					to associate so closely with a man as shady as Deloncle, and to throw good money 					after bad into a product as unsatisfactory as the RNP’s dreadful magazine, the 						Révolution Nationale? It was clearly time to 					distance himself. In late 1941, Schueller severed his connection with Deloncle 					and the MSR. This prompt dissociation was one of the main planks of his defense 					during his postwar trials for collaboration. Whatever his dealings with MSR, it 					was to his credit, the judges decided, that he had quit it in good time.

				It is the opinion of German men and women that 					women who pluck their eyebrows, use cosmetics, color their hair, and try to draw 					attention to themselves through eccentric behavior (for example smoking, face 					powder, etc.) belong to an older generation whose time has passed. The younger 					generation is against all these things, and youth has to be counted not by years 					but by strength of feeling. The women who are doing such things should be 					ashamed. . . . To be young means to be natural, and to understand the 					admonitions and demands of a great era.

				—DR. 						KRUMMACHER, LEADER 						OF THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST WOMEN’S 						ORGANIZATION, WRITING IN 					Koralle (A GERMAN GENERAL-INTEREST 						MAGAZINE), 1936

				Schueller 					could not deny that throughout the war years he had been one of the voices of 					the Occupation. The radio broadcasts and newspaper articles, the public lectures 					and the pep talks to his workforce spoke for themselves. But politics, he 					assured the court, had played no part in those talks: they had been concerned 					purely with economics. “If, like me, you’re convinced that you’ve found the 					answers to the world’s economic and social problems, you obviously can’t stop 					talking about them just because the wrong people listen.”35

				The burden of his broadcasts, speeches, and 					articles was indeed economic, the same ideas—about the proportional salary and 					bosses’ responsibilities—that he had been preaching for years. Thus, a radio 					talk on May 8, 1941, entitled “How Not to Die of Hunger This Winter,” was about 					the efficiency, or otherwise, of workers’ allotments and the importance of 					making the most of small parcels of land. And a public lecture titled “The 					Revolution of the Economy Is the Economy of a Revolution” (given at the Salle 					Pleyel, the concert hall on rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré) was about the 					proportional salary and new ways to calculate taxes. But there were other ideas, 					too. In June 1941, he promised, to a standing ovation, that “We are going to 					become the first state of a new Community. We shall issue twenty decrees in 					twenty days, one a day following the Rassemblement Nationale Populaire’s 					assumption of power. Then, in spite of her defeat—because of that defeat—France 					will once again take her rightful place in the world.”36 A talk on taxes was more problematic, culminating as it did with 					the phrase: “There can be no patriotism without a mystique of blood and soil.” 					Since ignorance of that mystique’s associations was unlikely for one so well 					acquainted with Hitler’s writings, this implies extreme innocence, Nazi 					leanings, or amoral opportunism. After the war he pleaded ignorance and 					innocence; and since that was what people preferred to believe, they did not 					question it, or him, too closely.

				These broadcasts and lectures were often published 					as articles, in propaganda newspapers such as L’Oeuvre or La Gerbe, or periodicals 					such as Révolution Nationale (which Schueller 					financed himself). But there was also another, and much more popular, vehicle 					for his ideas—his beauty magazine, Votre Beauté. For 					cosmetics were still, as they had always been, acutely political.

				In Britain and America, where women worked 					alongside men as a vital part of the war effort, glamor was recognized as being 					of the greatest psychological importance. When Helena Rubinstein asked President 					Roosevelt what she could do to help the war effort, FDR told her the story of a 					woman in London being stretchered out of a blitzed building. Offered a sedative, 					she insisted, first, on touching up her lipstick. “It just does something for 					me,” she said.

				It certainly did something for Helena Rubinstein, 					Inc. The company’s range that year included 629 items: 62 creams, 78 powders, 46 					perfumes, colognes, and eaux de toilette, 69 lotions, 115 lipsticks, plus soaps, 					rouges, and eye shadows. In 1941, its profits were $484,575; by 1942 they had 					almost doubled, to $823,529. That year every woman in the United States spent an 					average of twelve dollars on cosmetics.37 “You 					have got to look right down into their pocketbook and get 						that last nickel,” Madame remarked.

				The war was good for business in other ways, too. 					In a development that she could never, at her most optimistic, have imagined—and 					one that would transform the postwar beauty industry—Helena Rubinstein became an 					official supplier to the U.S. Army. A few years earlier, Madame had tried to 					introduce a line of men’s toiletries, House of Gourielli, opening a lavish salon 					on Fifth Avenue she hoped would induce a new habit of male pampering. It failed 					to take off, however. The salon closed, and the men’s toiletries line faded 					away. But the war succeeded where all her efforts and advertising had failed, 					and moved men’s toiletries into the mainstream. When the Allies invaded North 					Africa in 1942, every GI was issued a kitbox containing sunburn cream, 					camouflage makeup, and cleanser, discreetly lettered on the inside “Helena 					Rubinstein Inc” and including instructions on how to apply cosmetics in desert 					conditions. Army PX stores routinely stocked a range of aftershave lotions, skin 					creams, deodorants, talcum powder, sunburn lotions, lip cream, and cut-price 					cologne, for use where no bathing facilities were available.38 A lucrative new market beckoned. “Men could be 					a lot more beautiful,” Madame observed hopefully in 1943,39 and if she had anything to do with it, they 					would be.

				In Britain, too, glamor was taken seriously. It was 					becoming increasingly hard to source raw materials for the manufacture of 					cosmetics, which were classed as a nonessential industry. Even so, recruitment 					posters for Britain’s all-women Auxiliary Territorial Service, which provided 					drivers and ran army camps—a laborious and often drab life of catering, 					cleaning, and general maintenance—emphasized the importance of looking good. The 					most famous of these posters, Abram Games’s profile of a beautiful, poutingly 					lipsticked girl, her ATS cap set becomingly amid blond curls, caused something 					of a furor—for a poster, the ultimate compliment. People complained it was too 					sexy—and indeed, the girl might have stepped straight off a film set, perhaps 					one of those Powell and Pressburger wartime fables in which immaculately coiffed 					telephonists with cut-glass vowels inspire crashed airmen to cling to life. 					Games, however, stuck by his poster. It was, he insisted, drawn from life—a 					genuine ATS girl he had met in a train. British Vogue set out a detailed regime by which its readers might achieve 					comparable perfection, setting out a timetable for rising, washing, dressing, 					breakfasting, and making-up in one hour. Twenty of those sixty minutes were 					devoted to makeup. Lipstick, properly applied—color, blot, powder; color, blot, 					powder—would last all day without retouching. Helena Rubinstein had begun her 					career turning evening dresses into curtains. Now Vogue urged its readers to defeat rationing by turning their 					curtains into dresses—“Toile de Jouy curtains are ideal for pretty 					housecoats.”

				The Nazis, with their embrace of naturism, sport, 					and motherhood, officially abhorred such degeneracy. Hitler stopped short of 					closing beauty parlors and hairdressers, allowing them to remain open throughout 					the war because, as he remarked to Goebbels in 1943, “women after all constitute 					a tremendous power and as soon as you dare to touch their beauty parlors they 					are your enemies.”40 But as always when women 					were offically relegated to the kitchen and the nursery, cosmetics were frowned 					upon. As early as 1933, it was decreed in Breslau that “painted” women could not 					attend Party meetings. The single women chosen to breed for Germany in the 					“Lebensborn” project, in which Aryan maidens were put at the disposal of SS 					officers, were not permitted to use lipstick, paint their nails, or pluck their 					eyebrows. Reddened lips and cheeks might suit the “Oriental” or “southern” 					woman, the sort of woman destined for Auschwitz or Belsen, but Aryan beauties 					supposedly preferred the purity of a suntanned skin, with its natural sheen of 					perspiration. “Though our weapon is but the wooden spoon, its impact must be no 					less than that of other weapons!” declaimed Reichsfrauenführerin Gertrud Scholtz-Klink.41

				This stern philosophy was alien to France, where 					feminine beauty was an important part of the culture, and where devotion to 					style was epitomized by the haute couture for which 					Paris was renowned. Schueller’s own taste, however—oddly, it might be thought, 					for one whose business was so bound up with feminine beauty—tended, if his Révolution de l’économie is to be believed, rather 					toward the Nazi Kinder, Kirche, Küche (children, 					church, kitchen) model of womanhood. Votre Beauté 					reflected this. Its stern emphasis on fitness, sport, and diet, not to say the 					commercial imperative of selling more bottles of Ambre Solaire, had always 					inclined it to promote a healthy tan rather than lipstick and face powder, which 					were not L’Oréal products. Now it bracingly reflected the new hardship. 					Reappearing in a half-size format in November 1940, its first issue began with 					several pages of exercises as prescribed by Jean Borotra, the aging tennis star 					who had become the new regime’s General Commissioner for Sports. “Beauty,” the 					magazine declared, “is a discipline: it’s cowardly to let yourself go.” 					Naturally, wartime imposed certain difficulties when it came to grooming. But 					they could—must—be overcome. “No hot water? Tell yourself it’s all for the good! 					Cold water is far better for your health than hot. Hot water is a luxury for 					people made soft by carelessness. No more hot water, vive 						l’eau froide!” The magazine urged readers not to be nostalgic for the 					old days of culinary plenty: pictures of lamb chops were sternly crossed out, 					while plates of potatoes received a nod of approval with the exhortation: 					“Accept the restrictions bravely and with good grace—rationing will help you 					live longer.”1 Feeling the winter cold? Exercise was 					the thing! As for cosmetics, they were quite simply a relic of a discredited 					past age. “Women used to use far too much makeup—now we’re finding our true 					nature again,” readers were assured in the April 1941 issue.

				When it came to product placement, however, the 					demands of commerce won out over propaganda. “For a woman used to looking after 					her body, soap is as necessary as bread!” urged an ad for Monsavon. A 					neighboring ad for L’Oréal was equally forthright. “Dyeing your hair is no 					longer a matter of coquetry, it’s a gesture of defiance, a social necessity.” 					But the tone remained stern. Frivolity and flirtation in the dancehall belonged 					to a past age. In wartime, survival was what mattered—and the race went to the 					fittest. “Jobs are scarce, competition’s hot—you have to look young! However 					capable and experienced you may be, gray hair will mean you don’t get 					hired.”

				Strangely, Votre Beauté 					continued to feature the couture collections, some of which—Lanvin, Gres, 					Balenciaga—continued throughout the war years. Few of the magazine’s readers 					would have been able to afford these creations, but they had always been 					featured, and perhaps provided a comforting sense that life as it had once been 					was not wholly extinct. The most enthusiastic wartime clientele, however, was 					German. There was even a plan (soon abandoned) to remove the Paris couture 					houses wholesale to Berlin, a strangely schizophrenic notion given the official 					Nazi attitude toward chic, but one accurately reflecting the invaders’ taste for 					luxury.

				Whether Votre Beauté’s 					readers shared its stern outlook was doubtful. Most wartime photos of young 					Frenchwomen show no sign of a retreat into scrubbed dowdiness. On the contrary, 					they tried their best to stay seductive against the odds. One urban legend told 					how a smart hairdresser employed young men to generate electricity for the 					dryers by cycling on stationary tandems in the cellars. And perhaps it was true: 					similar tandems can still be seen in the catacombs beneath the 15th 					arrondissement.

				In 					those days of scarcity, when only approved publications were allotted paper and 					ink, Votre Beauté’s continued appearance confirmed 					that its owner toed the official line. It would form part of the case against 					him when, after the Liberation, Schueller had to face trial. In fact he was 					tried twice: once in 1946 for industrial collaboration as the owner of L’Oréal 					and Valentine—when he was all but convicted, scraping out an acquittal on the 					second hearing—and once in 1948 in his personal capacity as one of the leaders 					of MSR, when he was acquitted. Had he been found guilty on either count his 					businesses would have been nationalized, and he would have been banned from ever 					running a business in France again.

				Fortunately for him, little of the evidence brought 					against him was as clear and undeniable as the volumes of Votre Beauté. As usual when alleged collaborators were brought 					before the courts, there was a jumble of conflicting testimony, leaving gaps and 					ambiguities that could be interpreted more or less according to taste. The 					transcripts of the evidence given in Schueller’s trials show how hard it was to 					be certain either of witnesses’ motivations or of their veracity.

				For example, an item of evidence in both trials 					concerned a van requisitioned from L’Oréal by the Germans in 1944, when the 					Occupation was ending and they needed transport to evacuate both themselves and 					their loot. Everyone agreed that a van had indeed been handed over. But the 					courts heard three different versions of this story. In one, a late-model van 					was unquestioningly provided; in another, a van was provided, but it was a gazogène, a vehicle developed for use when petrol was 					unavailable and that ran on methane gas; in the third, a smart new van was 					promised, but the German in charge omitted to make a final check, and a 					broken-down old gazogène was substituted—one so 					decrepit that it had to be towed to within a few meters of the factory gate on a 					trailer, as it would never have made the entire journey unaided. Which story was 					true?

				At least vans were visible objects. Either they 					were or were not there, had or had not been provided. Less tangible, and so that 					much harder to pin down, were policies and attitudes. The detested Service du 					Travail Obligatoire, or STO, under which Frenchmen were compelled to go and work 					in Germany, was one example.

				At first the Germans had tried to raise a volunteer 					workforce by promising that for each volunteer who went to Germany, a French POW 					would be released. This arrangement was known as the Relève, and many of 					Schueller’s employees attested that he had addressed his workforce urging those 					unmarried and without family responsibilities to volunteer in this way. He 					offered substantial sums to any who did so volunteer, and explained that no one 					should hesitate to leave because they were worried about the living conditions 					they might expect: they would sleep in good beds and eat well. This was very far 					from the general horrific experience, though L’Oréal employees returning from 					Germany testified that they had received regular food parcels.

				Schueller admitted that he had indeed encouraged 					men to volunteer for the Relève, but insisted that he had been motivated purely 					by the desire to repatriate prisoners. When it became evident that the Germans 					were not in fact fulfilling this promise, he ceased to support it. In any case, 					the program soon ceased to be voluntary, and the Relève was replaced by the 					compulsory STO.

				But was Schueller’s real motivation as innocent as 					he tried to make it appear? One man testified that when he and his group left, 					“M.Schueller gave us lunch and a little pep talk, saying we didn’t need to be 					afraid, he had always felt more at home in Germany than in England.”42 The man was shocked to hear this overt 					enthusiasm for the invaders, though perhaps it was not entirely surprising given 					Schueller’s Alsatian parentage. Alsace borders Germany, its dialect is a form of 					German, and many Alsatians (though not Schueller) felt more German than 					French—so much so that some of the SS troops who perpetrated the massacre at 					Oradour-sur-Glâne in 1944 were Alsatian.2

				There is no doubt that Schueller, like all 					employers, tried to minimize the number of workers obliged to undertake this 					hated journey, as much for his own sake as for theirs. Experienced men were hard 					to replace. His line was that the reason he had agreed to fulfill some German 					business orders was in order to keep his workers in France, which may have been 					true but of course was also a handy way of justifying collaboration. He pointed 					out that his products had no military value, produced figures showing that the 					profits derived from German sales were zero in 1940 and 1941, less than 3 					percent of profits in 1942, just over 5 percent in 1943, and zero in 194443—and reiterated that he thought taking a few 					German orders would reduce the number of his workers forced to go to Germany. 					Schueller’s loyal manager at L’Oréal, Georges Mangeot, confirmed this story. He 					said they began to deal with the Germans in 1942 because they thought that 					otherwise, with no German business and in a nonvital industry, they would be 					disadvantaged with regard to STO.

				The STO numbers did indeed come down—from 200 to 93 					for L’Oréal, and from 75 to 5 for Monsavon. But Mangeot also described how, 					after discussing the matter with Schueller, he got the numbers reduced in quite 					another way—by bribing a German member of staff at the Bureau Allemand, who was 					later shot, having been caught taking similar bribes.44 And at Monsavon, the reduction was achieved by the young François 					Dalle, who persuaded a friendly commissaire de 						police to mislay, at considerable risk to himself, the factory’s list 					of eligible men (which included Dalle himself).45

				Necessary collaboration, or bribes, or a bit of 					both? In the complex and shadowy world of occupied France, survival, even for 					those as well-placed as Schueller, was an endless balancing act, this morsel of 					disobedience bought at the price of that obeisance to authority. And this 					balancing act was inevitably reflected in the postwar trials that came to be 					known as the épuration, or purge. Evidence depends 					on record, and the record reflected at best only a small part of the reality. 					The judging panels had to reconstitute what was missing as well as they 					could.

				Notoriously, people’s motive for testifying in 					these cases was, more often than not, revenge. Schueller’s case was no 					exception. His chief accuser, in both his trials, was a man called Georges 					Digeon who had once managed the L’Oréal canteen. It was Digeon who, in 1944, 					first drew the authorities’ attention to Schueller, in an affidavit accusing him 					of giving the MSR more than 20 million francs; of providing a room for it at rue 					Royale; and of being a member of the executive committee of Déat’s party. Digeon 					also raised the question of two vans: the one mentioned earlier, requisitioned 					by the Germans in 1944, and another allegedly given by Schueller to the MSR. 					This van had all its windows darkened except one at the back, enabling people to 					be photographed without their knowledge. Schueller, Digeon said, had provided 					these vehicles without question when asked. But others raised questions about 					Digeon himself. He was loathed throughout L’Oréal, was known by all as a 					collaborator who had done regular business with the Germans, and had been sacked 					in September 1944 “on the demand of the factory” for making baseless 					accusations. He had then gone straight to the local mairie, and had laid the accusations against Schueller that formed 					the basis of both the personal and industrial épuration trials.46 It could hardly 					be clearer that he was motivated by fury—and also, as with many such accusers, 					by an urgent need to divert attention from what he himself had done. On the 					other hand, that did not mean his accusations were groundless.

				Another piece of evidence presented at Schueller’s 					trials was an anonymous letter from some members of the CGT trade union at 					Valentine, denouncing Schueller for his support of the STO, and for employing 					known collaborators.

				If the few workers who 						are still there can bring themselves to tell the truth, they’ll confirm all 						this. We swear on the heads of our wives and children that we’re telling the 						truth, and we hope you’ll arrest that whole nest of collaborators, whether 						they’re millionaires or just working for a boss. . . . We promise 						to tell you who we are as soon as you start your enquiries, but you can’t 						trust these bastards, and as we need to eat we can’t sign our names yet 						because we’d be thrown out. . . . We swear on our honor that 						there’s no question of vengeance in all this, we’re just good Frenchmen who 						want to see the wicked punished.47

				But of course they were a bit more than that. As 					everyone knew, the trade unions had obvious reasons for hating Schueller, who 					publicly despised the workers’ democracy they stood for.

				Another difficulty was that, as the war progressed, 					people’s behavior changed with their expectations. In June 1940, a Nazi victory 					seemed imminent and inevitable. But in June 1941, Hitler invaded Russia, 					extending his fighting front by 1,800 miles and bringing the Red Army into the 					war on the Allies’ side. And in December 1941, the Japanese bombing of Pearl 					Harbor finally brought America, too, into the war. The German victory, which had 					seemed so certain, now seemed far less assured. Behavior that had seemed most 					ill-advised yesterday suddenly began to make sense, as prudent persons hedged 					their bets—among them, Schueller. On December, 10, 1942, he sent a note to 					L’Oréal representatives:

				Competitors are 						spreading lies about me. They come to clients with their order book and my 						book The Economic Revolution with passages underlined in red pencil, and use 						them to present me as a bad person who shouldn’t be dealt with.

				They accuse me of being 						German. I’m not.

				They accuse me of being 						Jewish. I’m Catholic. My father was a seminarist for a time. 						. . .

				I’m not interested in 						politics, but in political economy. . . . I was almost made a 						minister or an undersecretary but I refused because it would have been 						impossible to do what I would have wanted.

				I belonged to the 						Economic Commission of MSR—but only so long as MSR was approved by Marshal 						Pétain. When that was withdrawn, I resigned. . . .

				I think it my duty, in 						the present circumstances, to do all I can to help in what I consider to be 						the revival of my country. . . .48

				He did so by quietly extending his support to the 					Resistance as well as the occupiers. On the one hand, L’Oréal set aside a room 					for MSR meetings; on the other, Schueller also organized a weekly mail and 					parcel drop across the boundary between the zone 						occupée and the zone libre, using a 					L’Oréal van driven by an employee who happened to have an American passport 					(accredited with a forged German stamp). On the one hand, he continued to 					finance La Révolution Nationale; on the other, he 					gave 700,000 francs to the underground in the maquis in the Puy de Dôme and sent 					2 million francs to de Gaulle. He joined a network that helped more than two 					hundred people escape into the zone libre in the 					Cher, near Saint-Aignan; he helped others escape from Paris. At the beginning of 					1944, his paint firm, Valentine, gave over 100,000 francs to help réfractaires—workers who went underground to escape 					the STO. And all the time, while publicly supporting the official line, he 					maintained, within occupied Paris, amicable contacts with friends from earlier 					days.

				One such was Fred Joliot-Curie. The two had moved 					far apart since the early days at L’Arcouest. Joliot-Curie had remained in 					academic research, which, far from being “dusty,” had won him, together with his 					wife, Irène Curie, the 1935 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Like Schueller, he had 					always been socially conscious, but there, too, they had moved in opposite 					directions. Joliot-Curie was now a Communist and active in the Resistance, and 					had sent his papers on atomic research to London as soon as war broke out, 					keeping them out of Hitler’s grasp.

				The contrast between Joliot-Curie’s wartime life 					and that of Schueller illustrated the material advantages of collaboration. Both 					men were now famous and distinguished. But despite his eminence, Joliot-Curie 					was not sheltered from the general hardship, while for Schueller, life in 					wartime was far from austere.

				Schueller’s only real wartime inconvenience 					occurred in 1941, when he was forced to move out of his luxurious apartment on 					boulevard Suchet, in the smart 16th arrondissement, as all the apartment 					buildings in that street had been requisitioned by the Germans. The owner of the 					buildings wrote a pleading letter on behalf of his lessees to the sinister 					Fernand de Brinon, then Vichy’s “Ambassador to Paris.” None of the foreigners 					living in the apartment buildings had had to move; couldn’t at least the Aryan 					French be spared? These were important people: Madame Roederer of the champagne 					family; the president of Cinzano; M. Guerlain the perfumier; bankers; 						industrialists.49 No, they all had to go, 					even though Schueller’s name was included on a list of important industrial 					collaborators who, on the strict and express instruction of Reichsmarschall 					Göring, were to be allowed to keep their apartments in otherwise requisitioned 					districts. He moved to avenue Paul Doumer, a short walk away, but preferred to 					spend his time at his grand house, the Villa Bianca, at Franconville. 					Joliot-Curie, by contrast, could not even obtain a new tire for the motorbike on 					which he relied to commute between the Collège de France, where he held a chair, 					his lab at Ivry, and his temporary home outside Paris. His request was turned 					down, and a little later he registered the acquisition of a bicycle, with 					gears.

				Despite this disparity, the two remained on 					surprisingly amicable terms. For Joliot-Curie, Schueller presumably represented 					that invaluable wartime necessity—one of the enemy who could be trusted on a 					personal level. Despite what he must have felt about Schueller’s politics, he 					still felt able to request help for a Jewish chemical engineer languishing in a 					prisoner-of-war camp and who might be a useful employee in Schueller’s 					businesses. Schueller replied to his “cher ami,” from a spa where he was taking 					the cure for rheumatism, that to his great regret he could not help—he had 					“approached M. Scapini many times, and we got a few people out at first, but 					there’s been nothing doing on that front for a while now. You can imagine, I’m 					really sorry about this.”50 Georges Scapini was 					the man deputed by Pétain to negotiate with the German authorities regarding 					prisoners of war. If he couldn’t help, no one could.

				In return, Schueller requested a favor of his 					own—one that throws a rare light on his personal life. In 1927 his first wife, 					Berthe, had died, and in 1932 he had married again. The second Madame Schueller 					was Liliane’s English governess, Miss Annie Burrows from Fulham (a genteelly 					run-down part of southwest London), a choice that may reflect her charm, or 					simply Schueller’s own loneliness and lack of social life. He felt that a wife 					at home was something every man needed. It was one of the social rules set out 					in the Révolution de l’économie. And his 					work-centered life afforded him few opportunities to meet suitable ladies.

				At the time, Miss Burrows (generally known as Nita) 					must have been overwhelmed by her good luck. Although governesses in novels 					frequently married their wealthy employers, they rarely did so in real life. But 					when war broke out, her position, as an Englishwoman married to a leading 					collaborator, became equivocal, to say the least. She was by no means the only 					wife to find herself in a similarly awkward fix. The chief Vichy Jew-hunter, the 					odious Darquier de Pellepoix, was married to an Australian, while Fernand de 					Brinon, an arch-anti-Semite, had a Jewish wife. How Madame de Brinon felt we do 					not know. Madame Darquier drowned her troubles in drink. As for Madame 					Schueller, she seems to have taken refuge in nervous ill health. “The doctor who 					used to advise Madame Schueller, Dr. Layani, is a non-Aryan, and has escaped to 					the zone libre,” Schueller wrote. “I’m looking for a 					replacement, someone really good on women’s illnesses . . . and who 					can put up with my wife’s short temper. Would the director of the Hôpital Curie 					know anyone?” Joliot-Curie gave a name, and undertook to write a letter of 					recommendation. He enclosed, along with his note, two flasks of rabbit urine, 					one irradiated, the other a control.51 Between 					the politics and the business maneuvers, Schueller still kept up his interest in 					chemistry.

				Obviously, when forced to account for himself by 					the épuration, he did his best to emphasize his 					Resistance-friendly activities and draw a veil over the others. It was not an 					easy task, given that those others had been so very public. But although 					Schueller’s was an extreme case, so many businessmen were prosecuted for 					collaboration following the Liberation that at least one employers’ federation, 					that of the ironmasters, circulated a questionnaire to its members to help them 					prepare dossiers in their own defense. Two main defense planks were recommended: 					one, that they had kept the largest possible proportion of their production for 					the use of the French civilian economy and had done as little as possible for 					the Germans; two, that they had obstructed the deportation of their workers for 					the STO.52

				Schueller, like everyone else, stressed these. And 					like everyone else, he showed how he had helped Jews escape the Nazi horrors. 					All those he had helped in their hour of need now repaid the debt by writing 					letters in his support. Two brothers named Freudiger, neighbors in Brittany, had 					told him they were thinking of joining de Gaulle in London. Schueller warmly 					encouraged them to do so. Professor Levy of the École Normale, a consultant 					chemist to L’Oréal, fled to Lyon in the zone libre 					and received money while he was there, paid through L’Oréal’s Lyon branch. 					Another professor of chemistry, M. Meyer, who taught at Lyon University, was 					sacked from the faculty by Vichy and left without work. Schueller offered a loan 					to be repaid after the war, as well as other unspecified help. Every time the 					two met, Meyer testified, Schueller repeated his hatred of the Germans, of the 					Nazis, of racism. A L’Oréal chemist, M. Chain, first continued to work under a 					false name, but then had to vanish. He continued to be paid. Mlle. Huffner, a 					secretary, was paid under a false name, and money was sent to her when she left 					for the zone libre. M. Kogan, the factory manager at 					Valentine, was a Russian émigré, naturalized only recently, and was therefore 					caught by the Nazi laws that declared all Jews in this situation to be 					noncitizens, liable to deportation. Schueller bought him false papers to escape 					to Portugal; when they failed, and he was stuck in Spain, Schueller arranged a 					job with L’Oréal’s Spanish subsidiary. M. Schatzkes, L’Oréal’s commercial 					director, was sent to Lyon; when competitors complained that the Lyon branch had 					a Jewish manager, he was sent to Marseille; and when that became dangerous, he 					stayed in a villa at St. Jean Cap-Ferrat until Marseille became safe again. When 					the Germans finally arrived there, he and his wife were enabled to escape to 					Switzerland.

				Almost everyone hauled up before the courts in the 					postwar purges could offer similar examples. Admiral Darlan himself, who for 					some time was Pétain’s deputy (and, thus, effectively head of the Vichy 					government), and who negotiated a political alliance between French Vichy forces 					and Nazi Germany, pleaded for Jews who had married into his own family—all 					belonging to “good old French Jewish families”—to be spared deportation. Perhaps 					helping a few individuals made it easier not to think about the rest—or perhaps, 					conversely, the thought of people one knew and liked being subjected to some 					terrible fate made the awful reality too uncomfortably clear.

				The few contemporary documents that survive from 					the Jewish community show just how difficult it was to persuade people to 					confront that reality. Hélène Berr, the daughter of a prominent Jewish 						industrialist,3 kept a journal giving a day-by-day 					account of life as a Jew in occupied Paris. In entry after entry, she records 					her helpless horror as one after another of her friends and acquaintances is 					deported. In November 1943, the Berrs’ neighbor, Mme. Agache,

				came rushing in because 						she had just heard that young Mme. Bokanowski, who had been sent to the 						Hôpital Rothschild with her two infants when her husband was in Drancy, had 						been taken back to Drancy. She asked Maman: “You mean to say they are 						deporting children?” She was horrified.

				It’s impossible to 						express the pain that I felt on seeing that she had taken all this time to 						understand, and that she had only understood because it concerned someone 						she knew. Maman . . . replied: “We have been telling you so for a 						whole year, but you would not believe us.”

				Not knowing, not 						understanding even when you do know, because you have a closed door inside 						you, and you only can realize what you merely know if you open it. That is 						the enormous drama of our age. Everyone is blind to those being 						tortured.53

				Schueller, of course, had invested everything in 						not confronting these realities. While he 					comforted his conscience by helping his own Jewish acquaintances, his new 					friends and colleagues from MSR were dividing the spoils of abandoned Jewish 					property—that property whose “administration” was such a valued perk of 					collaborationist life. “I didn’t much enjoy the Friday policy meetings [of MSR 					at the L’Oréal offices] because they went on too long,” Henry Charbonneau 					remembered. “I was only too happy to leave L’Oréal’s fancy panelling for my 					office in rue Paradis (where we had taken over the LICA building) and get on 					with working on propaganda.”54 LICA was the 					Ligue Contre Antisémitisme.

				Schueller’s épuration 					hearing for personal offenses took place in 1948. He was acquitted with little 					trouble. In the end what seems to have weighed with the judge was less the 					evidence, which could be read so many different ways, than the character 					references given by two witnesses. One was his old friend Jacques Sadoul, who 					was still a Communist—an important recommendation, since the Communists had been 					the only political party to support the Resistance officially—and had now also 					become mayor of Ste. Maxime in the Var. And the other, whose evidence tipped the 					scales in Schueller’s favor, was Pierre de Bénouville, a garlanded Resistance 					hero, founder in 1942 of the Mouvements Unis de la Résistance, organizer of the 					Free French forces in Algeria, and who had been named a general on the Italian 					front—one of only three résistants to end the war 					with this rank.

				Bénouville’s testimony concerned one of those 					incidents that now reads like something out of an action movie, but which were 					quite commonplace during the dark and dramatic days of the Occupation. One of 					Schueller’s Resistance contacts, a man named Max Brusset, notified him that a 					delegate of the Provisional Government in Algiers wanted to meet him. The 					meeting was to take place at Brusset’s apartment at 28, boulevard Raspail. It 					was agreed that Schueller would prepare a report concerning certain questions, 					and deliver it Saturday morning. Needing a little longer, he asked to delay the 					delivery until Monday morning at eleven. But at nine o’clock Monday, there was a 					phone call from Brusset: he had the flu, Schueller shouldn’t come. In fact, at 					seven that morning the Gestapo had arrived at the apartment. Brusset’s 					sixth-floor bedroom gave onto a terrace, from which he had been able to jump 					onto another terrace on the fifth floor and enter the apartment from which he 					was now phoning. He was able to contact all save one of the people who had been 					due to meet that morning; that one arrived as arranged, carrying incriminating 					papers, was arrested, and almost certainly shot. Bénouville knew Brusset, and 					had promised him that he would provide an authenticating certificate for this 					story when he returned to Paris.55 The panel 					accepted Benouville’s evidence and recommended a relaxe.

				The hearings for industrial collaboration, however, 					which began in 1946 and were not resolved until two years later, had been more 					problematic. The panel found that Schueller’s Resistance activities were not 					enough to outweigh the evidence that he had collaborated with the Germans. He 					had organized lectures in his factories, promised help to men who volunteered to 					fight alongside the Germans, funded the MSR, published La 						Révolution de l’économie with its anti-union tirades, devised the 					economic policy of the RNP and encouraged the Relève. The panel did not feel 					that the various Resistance activities he had brought to their notice 					counterbalanced this, and found him guilty. In addition to disqualifying him 					from business, the panel also threatened to forward the evidence to the Court of 					Justice, which might have confiscated his assets, sentenced him to national 					disgrace, to a prison term, or even to death.

				And if Schueller was not guilty of collaboration, 					who was? Not only did his name appear in RNP and MSR literature alongside those 					of Marcel Déat, who was sentenced to death, and Eugène Deloncle, whom only 					assassination saved from a comparable fate, but he had left an indelible trail 					in numerous articles, pamphlets, and broadcasts, all urging collaboration; his 					book La Révolution de l’économie had been published 					on the same list as the works of Hitler himself. Acts or motives might remain 					cloudy, but the published word was one thing that could not be denied.

				Once again, however, Bénouville saved him. Twice—at 					the first hearing, and again after the guilty verdict—he sent urgent letters, 					stressing his desire to testify on behalf of the accused, visiting the judge and 					the Préfet, apologizing when business took him away from Paris at the crucial 					moment. Schueller, he insisted, was a victim of his fixation on proportional 					salaries, which had led him into various imprudent actions. But he had been of 					inestimable help to Bénouville.56 Bénouville 					got his way, and Schueller was let off.

				Such solidarity between resisters and collaborators 					was not unusual during the épuration. As Schueller’s 					own activities demonstrated, channels of communication between the two sides had 					always remained open. During the Occupation, collaborators often put in a word 					for a Resistance figure in trouble. Now those who had been helped, helped in 					their turn. Bénouville testified in this way on behalf of many old friends. What 					was interesting about his efforts for Schueller, however, was that the two had 					met only once, and then briefly (when Schueller, anxious to buy himself onto the 					winning side, had promised financial aid when Bénouville needed it). Indeed, 					Bénouville insisted that Schueller had never approached him personally for help. 					What he had done, he had done for Max Brusset. Even so, it seems surprising that 					he should have put quite so much effort into getting Schueller cleared. Why had 					he done so?

				The answer, like everything else about Schueller, 					could be traced back to the life rules he had evolved. The way both Schueller 					and Rubinstein conducted their family affairs would be decisive in the 					intermingling of their stories. And Bénouville, for Schueller, was family—albeit 					that family was a surrogate one, and Bénouville only a tangential member.

				Family Affairs




I

				The sons and grandsons of an industry’s creators 					won’t take risks. Sons should inherit money, but not management. If a son wants 					to work, he should take a job elsewhere and work his way up.

				—EUGÈNE 						SCHUELLER, La 						Révolution de l’économie

				Among the 					most strongly held of Eugène Schueller’s many strongly held beliefs was the 					conviction that businesses (as opposed to money) should not be passed on as a 					family inheritance. When Helena Rubinstein’s first grandchildren were born, she 					declared, “Now the business will last for three hundred years!”1 But such a thought would have been anathema to 					Schueller. On the contrary, he thought entrepreneurship required very particular 					skills, and that “being a general’s son doesn’t automatically make you a good 					general.” (This was a pet expression of Schueller’s, and he used these same 					words in article after article, lecture after lecture.)

				Of course, it was easy for him to say this. His 					only child was a daughter, which (given his view of woman’s place in the world) 					ruled her out as a possible candidate. And since he had no siblings, he had no 					aspiring nephews. But it also left him with a problem. Building up L’Oréal had 					been his life’s work. It would have been less than human, not to say 					irresponsible, to give no thought to his eventual successor. Schueller, of all 					people, knew that his day-to-day decisions affected the lives of hundreds, 					possibly thousands, of people. Since he was not immortal, perhaps the most 					important decision of all concerned the man who would take his place when he 					died or retired. But who would that be? And how would Schueller identify him? As 					the thirties drew on and he moved into his middle fifties, he began, consciously 					or subconsciously, to look around for the young man who would become, in effect, 					his surrogate son.

				As it turned out there would be two such people, 					each playing a different filial role.

				The first, André Bettencourt, was introduced to 					Schueller in 1938 by a journalist friend, who invited Bettencourt to lunch with 					“a man you really ought to meet, he’s extraordinary.”2 Bettencourt was then nineteen, Schueller fifty-seven. The meeting 					took place in Schueller’s boulevard Suchet apartment, where Bettencourt also met 					Schueller’s daughter, Liliane. The friendship flourished. In December 1941, 					Bettencourt referred in an article to “a remarkable book by a friend, M. E. 					Schueller, called ‘La Révolution de l’Economie’ . . . that all 					businessmen ought to read.”3

				In that same year, 1941, Bettencourt drew 					Schueller’s attention to another promising young man: his friend François Dalle. 					The two had met as students in 1936, when both lived at a university residence 					for young men such as themselves—Catholic, provincial, well-connected—run by the 					Marist Fathers at 104, rue de Vaugirard. In 1941, Dalle needed a job, and 					Bettencourt thought Schueller might have one for him.

				Although Bettencourt and Dalle were both members of 					the Catholic bourgeoisie, they had grown up in very disparate milieux. The 					Bettencourts were traditional Normandy landowners, conservative and rooted in 					their village, St. Maurice d’Ételan, of which André’s father was the mayor, of 					which he would in time become mayor himself, and where they were intricately 					intermarried with the surrounding seigneurial families. They were pious, and M. 					Bettencourt père went on frequent religious 					retreats, although meditation did not prevent him writing home to remind his 					gardeners, when planting new apple trees, to “if possible put some fresh soil in 					the holes.”4 These two preoccupations—religious 					and agricultural—were passed on to André, and were reflected in his wartime 					activities.

				By contrast, the Dalles were industrialists from 					France’s gritty Nord. François’s father was a brewer in Wervicq-Sud, near the 					Belgian border. The family lived beside the brewery, and their neighbors were 					mostly working families. François grew up in an austere and socially conscious 					household, aware from his earliest youth of industrial conflict and the ravages 					of war. He realized, too, that the main source of unrest in the local textile 					industry—the workers’ continuing and justified complaints about their low level 					of pay, the factory owners’ riposte that as their profits were so low, they 					could not afford to pay more—arose because of outdated attitudes and machinery. 					Capitalism, he concluded, could be justified only insofar as it brought material 					abundance. 5

				By the time the two young men arrived in Paris, 					toward the end of 1936, it was clear that Europe was sliding toward another 					general conflict, and that France, if involved, would almost certainly be 					defeated. In 1937 and again in 1938, Dalle, Bettencourt, and some other friends 					from the old university lodgings at 104, rue de Vaugirard, including France’s 					future president François Mitterrand, whose family was in the vinegar business 					in the Charente, visited Luxembourg, Belgium, and Germany during their 					vacations. They saw tanks rolling at full speed through villages while the 					villagers cheered and girls threw flowers. On one memorable day, on a riverbank 					near the German-Luxembourg border, they watched as a thousand soldiers in 					swimming-gear stood at attention while a hundred-piece orchestra played 					Beethoven, and then, at the sound of a bugle, threw themselves, as one man, into 					the river. It was an impressive show of fitness and discipline, and the young 					Frenchmen were left wondering how their ragtag conscript army could ever stand 					up to a force composed of men such as that.6

				In this charged and uncertain atmosphere, the young 					men from 104 inclined to the right. The left seemed to offer only chaos. 					Fascism—not as practiced by Hitler, but of the Mussolini and Salazar Catholic 					variety—at least held out the possibility of order. “We didn’t think Mussolini 					would go in with Hitler,” Dalle said. “We were bourgeois students, Catholics. 					. . . We knew the war was lost before it began, because our arms were 					as hopeless as our high command. We were just cannon fodder. 						. . .”7 They were mostly studying 					law, and preferred to use the faculty library, which was recognized as the 					province of the far-right Camelots du Roi, rather than the Sorbonne library, 					where, Dalle said, “less than 5 percent were non-Marxists, and not a single girl 					ever caught your eye.”8

				When the war came, Dalle, Mitterrand, and 					Bettencourt, like all young Frenchmen, were called up. Following the debacle of 					France’s capitulation, Mitterrand was captured and sent to a prisoner-of-war 					camp inside Germany, an experience that would shape his future political career, 					while Bettencourt and Dalle returned to Paris, and looked around for something 					to do. Bettencourt found a job in journalism, writing a youth-interest column 					under the heading Ohé les jeunes! for a magazine 					called La Terre Française, directed at 					agriculturists. Dalle thought of resuming his studies. But his preferred 					professors were no longer teaching their courses, and besides, having just 					married, he needed to earn some money. Going through the want ads one day he 					noticed that the Society of French Soapmakers, working through Monsavon, was 					looking for trainees. He knew that Schueller owned Monsavon, and knew and liked 					his economic theories. He knew, too, that his friend André was acquainted with 					the Schuellers. Bettencourt encouraged him to apply for the job.

				Schueller, who always took a personal interest in 					trainees, met Dalle, agreed to hire him, and asked where he came from. The Nord, 					Dalle replied. “That’s good,” Schueller said. “In this country there are only 					two sets of people who really work, the ones from Alsace, and the ones from the 					Nord.” A few days later, Dalle presented himself for work at the Monsavon 					factory in Clichy, a dank place in what he described as “the miserabilist style 					of the Paris suburbs.” He was twenty-four. His job was to help the sales 					director’s secretary—“a radical change of direction,” as he observed, “for 					someone who had always dreamed of teaching law.”9

				His first job, which he hated, consisted of 					multiplying the number of soaps sold by their price, to calculate turnover. But 					at the end of 1943 the sales director fell ill, and the managing director 					mysteriously vanished: suddenly, at the age of twenty-five, Dalle found himself 					the de facto boss of a large factory. Schueller liked to divide his colleagues 					into two categories: people men and things men. Dalle certainly wasn’t a “things 					man,” though there were two in the factory: they had just devised an innovative 					continuous soap-making process that would prove valuable in the immediate 					postwar years. However, they couldn’t try it out on Monsavon’s wartime product, 					which consisted almost wholly of bentonite and kaolin and contained virtually no 					fat. It could hardly be called soap at all. And there were problems with morale. 					Keeping Monsavon’s little community going in those desperate days, when food of 					any kind was short, good food almost unobtainable, and nobody trusted anyone 					else, was an invaluable experience for the “people man” François Dalle would 					become.

				Monsavon survived the war. But it then faced the 					problem of surviving the peace, which had its own difficulties. In wartime the 					buying public had grabbed anything put before it, including Monsavon’s ersatz 					soap; but now the presence of American troops and American products reminded 					battered Europeans of a long-forgotten abundance. American competition meant 					hard times for indigenous companies facing huge shortages of raw materials. 					Dalle thought for a while about returning to the law, but he had lost the habit 					of study, and soon realized that the subject no longer interested him. So he 					returned joyfully to Monsavon and the entrepreneurial life he found so 					exhilarating, and was put in charge.

				During these years, Schueller let Dalle get on with 					the job without interference. One summer Sunday in 1948, however, an indication 					came that Schueller had plans for him. Summoned to the Franconville house, Dalle 					was informed that, starting the next day, he was to work at L’Oréal as well as 					Monsavon. He had done well with Monsavon and, hopefully, would continue to do 					so. But now it was time to find his place within the company as a whole. “I was 					flattered, but terribly embarrassed,” Dalle remembered. “It hadn’t ever crossed 					my mind that women’s hair grew white as they got older, let alone that they 					might dye it—the notion that one might want to change the natural order of 					things would have seemed odd to me, actually almost shocking. Where I came from 					women didn’t use cosmetics.”10

				This uncertainty was soon buried, however, beneath 					the whirlwind of his new life. He was given an office at rue Royale and began 					the long task of getting to know a new business and gaining the trust of 					longstanding lieutenants over whose heads he was all too evidently being 					promoted. He soon became Schueller’s chief confidant, which meant adopting his 					chief’s frenetic pace. From six till eight a.m. he read notes dictated by 					Schueller the previous evening, then walked for an hour around the park at 					Bagatelle, near where he lived, before dictating his responses. He spent the 					morning at Monsavon and the afternoon at L’Oréal, staying there until nine—the 					hour when Schueller left the office.

				After a few months of this pace he became tired, 					and Schueller offered him and his family the L’Arcouest house for a couple of 					weeks of relaxation and enjoyment. It rained solidly; when the offer was renewed 					the following year, Dalle’s wife and children refused to accompany him. It 					rained again; cooped up all alone in the big house, Dalle thought longingly of 					Paris and all the work awaiting his return. He called for his secretary and 					resumed his Parisian work schedule, wondering later if this had not been a 					deliberate ploy on the part of Schueller, who did the same thing during his vacations.

				It was soon clear to them both that Dalle would be 					L’Oréal’s next chief executive. But it was not until 1957, when Schueller’s 					health began to fail, that this was said in so many words. That July, Dalle was 					summoned to L’Arcouest. He found Schueller tanned and apparently well, but 					appearances were deceptive: he was dying. He was L’Oréal’s present, the old man 					said, but Dalle would be its future. The speech left both of them in tears. Not 					long after it, Schueller died, and Dalle became managing director of 						L’Oréal. Where, politically and 					commercially, Schueller had remained essentially a man of the 1930s, Dalle would 					move L’Oréal into the postwar world.11

				While 					Dalle was taking his place as Schueller’s industrial heir, André Bettencourt had 					maintained their friendship on a more personal level: in 1950, he would marry 					Schueller’s daughter, Liliane. The file of papers concerning Schueller’s épuration trial contains two letters from Bettencourt, 					one written in January 1944, the other in September of the same year. They make 					it clear that the two had become close enough for Schueller to trust the younger 					man with both money and personal confidences.

				By 1944, the course of the war had turned in the 					Allies’ favor, and those who had positioned themselves three years earlier in 					expectation of a German victory now found themselves somewhat awkwardly placed. 					Bettencourt had spent the first years of the war as a journalist, writing for 					collaborationist and Pétainist publications, and had later spent some time at 					Vichy, working for the Pétain administration there. It is clear from his January 					letter to Schueller that both of them anticipated difficulties if, as seemed 					increasingly likely, the Germans were defeated.

				You told me about your 						fears, and various conversations I had before I left Paris seem 						unfortunately to justify them. Do be very careful. You’re so terribly 						impulsive about everything, but I think you should be very cautious about 						revealing too much regarding the way you’ve helped some of us, and some 						friendships should also be kept quiet; if you’re publicly compromised, those 						who have been close to you might find themselves in a delicate 						position.

				I think, and I hope 						you’ll agree, that the essential thing for you is to get social matters 						organized. . . .

				This prophecy of trouble ahead was soon fulfilled. 					When the war ended, Schueller was hauled in front of the courts on a charge of 					collaboration, where, as we have seen, he was liberated largely because of the 					efforts of Pierre de Bénouville, whom he had barely met. And here, at last, is 					the explanation for this surprising intervention: Bénouville had been a 					contemporary of Dalle and Bettencourt at 104 rue de Vaugirard, and it was 					largely to oblige these friends that he agreed to testify for Schueller. 					Bettencourt, if not Schueller, had social matters highly organized, and 					Schueller now benefited from his excellent connections.

				Bénouville was not in any way put out by 					Schueller’s links with the cagoulards and MSR—rather the opposite: he had 					himself been an enthusiastic cagoulard. His name appears in the Corre list of 					members, and although when questioned in old age he refused to admit directly 					that he had belonged to La Cagoule, he reaffirmed that he thought Filliol and 					Deloncle had been “good chaps who refused to give in” (Des 						gens très sympas qui ne voulaient pas céder). On the same occasion he 					said that he quite understood why it had been necessary to assassinate the 					Soviet diplomat Dmitri Navachine—he had been trying to infiltrate the royalist 					journal Le Courrier Royal, something Bénouville 					seems to have felt merited a death sentence.12 					His nationalism was so extreme that it was impossible for him to countenance any 					form of collaboration with the German occupation. But his gut loathing of the 					left remained undimmed, even when they were his fellow résistants. As Pierre Péan’s Vie et morts de 						Jean Moulin shows, he was almost certainly part of the complex 					machinations that betrayed the Communist Resistance leader Jean Moulin to the 					Germans. Moulin, a man Bénouville saw as standing “on the very left of the 					left,” was an associate of Pierre Cot, who had been interior minister at the 					time of the great demonstration of February 6, 1934, and who had ordered the 					police to fire on the crowd: “That was something about Moulin that I didn’t like 					at all.”13 Bénouville preferred to deal with 					characters like Georges Soulès, who had belonged to MSR but who in 1943 switched 					over to the Resistance, and who was close enough to Bénouville to have a special 					postbox arrangement to communicate with him.14 					Indeed, Bénouville was, if anything, to the right of Schueller 					politically—certainly in his anti-Semitism. In 1937 he had been a regular 					contributor to Le Pays Libre, a violently 					anti-Semitic publication.1

				It was the 104 network, too, that steered 					Bettencourt clear of the anticipated post-Liberation hazards. By the summer of 					1944 it was obvious that anyone who wanted to enter public life after the war 					would need to show they had been a résistant, and 					Mitterrand and Bénouville, who both had starry Resistance credentials, had 					worked together to ensure, while there was still time, that their old friend 					Bettencourt would come out of the war with the correct reputation. They did so 					by arranging to send him to Geneva on Resistance business.

				I’m just back from 						Geneva [Bettencourt wrote Schueller that September]. I can’t come to rue 						Royale immediately, but I can tell you that your Swiss affairs are in good 						shape. . . . As it turned out I didn’t need the money you so 						kindly made available to me there. There was enough credit available from 						the Resistance delegation. . . .15

				The Geneva trip did what it was intended to do, and 					in the years following the war, Bettencourt swiftly climbed the political 					ladder. Meanwhile, his intimacy with the Schuellers grew. Liliane Schueller was 					tubercular, and spent the winter of 1947–48 in the Swiss resort of Leysin; André 					joined her there, at the chic Hotel Belvedere. Soon the two were engaged, and on 					January 9, 1950, André Bettencourt and Liliane Schueller were married. The 					ceremony took place at Vallauris, the home of a family friend, rather than at 					Franconville or L’Arcouest. Evidently Liliane did not regard the second Madame 					Schueller as part of the family—or not enough to host her wedding reception. 					Nor, it seemed, did Schueller himself. Interviewed in 1954, he told journalist 					Merry Bromberger that he had “lost his wife, who had been such a support to him 					[and that] his daughter, Madame Bettencourt, the wife of a young deputy for 					Seine-Infèrieure, looks after the house at Franconville.”16 Of the former Miss Burrows there was no 						mention.2

				By this time the 104-L’Oréal connection had widened 					to include François Mitterrand. Mitterrand had had a busy and productive war. 					After escaping from his prisoner-of-war camp he had become caught up in Vichy 					politics, receiving the Francisque medal from Pétain himself, at the same time 					using his position at the head of the prisoners-of-war organization to run an 					important Resistance network. He had also fallen in love and got married. It was 					a varied, thrilling, and risky double and treble life, and one he hugely 					enjoyed. When the Liberation brought it to an end, he felt restless and 					dissatisfied. He wanted to enter politics, but was unable to locate a suitable 					political niche. Meanwhile his wife was pregnant, and he urgently needed to earn 					some money. So he turned to his friends for help—and, as always, 104 did not 					disappoint. Dalle, supported by André Bettencourt, used his influence with 					Schueller, and for a while, before returning to politics and getting elected as 					deputy for the Nièvre, Mitterrand edited Votre 						Beauté.

				He hated it. Editing a women’s magazine for a 					beauty-products company was not the future the ambitious François had envisaged. 					Every evening when he came home he grumbled to his wife about how he was wasting 					his life. For Schueller, L’Oréal represented first a scientific challenge, and 					then a bottomless fountain of cash. For Dalle, it would be a fascinating and 					lucrative career following in the footsteps of a man he revered. But although 					Mitterrand was grateful for the comfortable salary, he felt his association with 						Votre Beauté made him look ridiculous. Although 					his actual name never appeared, his alter ego Frédérique Marnais was much in 					evidence, writing articles and responding to readers’ letters. Why was François 					Mitterrand, of all people, advising women on their emotional problems and beauty 					routines? He made a few feeble attempts to turn Votre 						Beauté into a literary magazine, but met with no encouragement—there 					were, Danielle Mitterrand remembered, “constant battles with the editorial 						board.”17 And at home, things were also not 					going well. The Mitterrands’ first baby died at the age of three months, an 					event from which both he and his wife struggled to recover.

				Frédérique Marnais welcomed in the new year of 1946 					with a touching and heartfelt piece entitled “A Woman’s Most Beautiful Necklace: 					The Arms of a Little Child.”18 But by then the 					association was clearly doomed. “I don’t exactly see this job as a religious 						calling,”19 he wrote irritably to his 					L’Oréal superiors—a fatal admission in a company where this was precisely the 					kind of dedication required from senior staff. As was inevitable, Mitterrand 					left L’Oréal soon after, and spent the summer of 1946 looking for a winnable 					seat in the Chamber of Deputies. In November he found it, in the department of 					the Nièvre, and by 1947 he was minister for war veterans.

				It was Mitterrand who brought Pierre de Bénouville 					onto the Schueller scene. Hauled up before the courts in 1946 on a charge of 					industrial collaboration, Schueller was in real danger of being convicted. And 					he knew—none better—the damning evidence that might be brought against him, even 					though a lot of what had been most compromising had not been recorded. In the 					end it was the quality of the witnesses that mattered—who testified against you, 					and who supported you. He needed to find people who would testify in his favor 					and whom the court could not dismiss—in other words, people with good Resistance 					credentials and political connections. The obvious person was Mitterrand, but he 					was taken up by political campaigning. So Pierre de Bénouville was called 					in—Mitterrand being an even older friend of his than Bettencourt, since the two 					of them had not only been students together, but had attended the same school in 					Angoulême.

				Bénouville did not disappoint. It was thanks to him 					that Eugène Schueller survived. He, who for the whole of his life had stood 					quite outside the family, business, and educational networks whose members 					controlled France, became caught up, through the boys from 104, at the very 					center of one such network. From this moment on, Schueller, his family, friends, 					and associates, would be part of the establishment—with all the potential for 					scandal and embarrassment that entailed.




II

				For Helena 					Rubinstein, too, the war changed everything.

				The buyback from Lehman Brothers had marked, as 					Titus feared, the end of their marriage. They divorced in 1937, and by 1938 					Madame had married again.

				She met her new husband, the Georgian prince 					Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia, at a bridge party given by her old friend 					Marie-Blanche de Polignac (the daughter of her even older friend, Jeanne 					Lanvin). His title was a little dubious—gossip had it that when he presented his 					intended bride with a copy of the Almanach de Gotha, 					the page detailing his heritage had been specially printed and inserted. But no 					one was about to travel to Georgia to check it out. And in the meantime he was 					handsome, charming, and he made her laugh. They met again, several times, before 					she left Paris for New York. “Where do you like to dine in New York?” Artchil 					artlessly enquired. At the Colony, Helena replied. “Two weeks later he 					telephoned me, in New York. He had just arrived and meant to hold me to my 					promise, he said. Within an hour he called for me at my home, and that evening 					we dined at the Colony. How could I resist such a man? Our courtship was brief. 					In his usual direct way he said, ‘We are neither of us children, Helena, and you 					need me.’ ”20 He was forty-three, she, 					sixty-six. They understood each other perfectly.

				It was an excellent marriage. Unlike Titus, Artchil 					was only too happy to be Mr. Helena Rubinstein. He appreciated the opulent 					living and material peace of mind this title bestowed, and the price was not 					excessive: “I only had to sleep with her once,” he is reported to have 						said.21 After that he looked, with tactful 					discretion, elsewhere—an arrangement which suited them both perfectly. At 					sixty-six, an ardent sex life was not one of Helena’s requirements, if indeed it 					ever had been. She had married Artchil for other reasons. He was presentable, 					sweet-tempered, funny, and affectionate; her family, who mostly regarded each 					other with suspicion and dislike, all loved Artchil. And—he made his wife a 					princess! That little Chaja Rubinstein would become Princess Gourielli was a 					fate even her most extravagant imaginings could not have anticipated.

				It was also indirectly because of Artchil that she 					had to acknowledge something that had not concerned her since she left 					Kazimierz: the fact of her Jewishness.

				Helena’s idea of relaxation had hitherto been 					limited to bridge or the theater. But Artchil wanted to give parties, so she 					found a suitable apartment: a twenty-six-room triplex on Park Avenue at 					Sixty-fifth Street. When she tried to buy it, however, her offer was turned 					down: the building had a no-Jews policy. Enraged, Madame bought the building. 					The apartment was hers. But for the first time in her life, anti-Semitism had 					become something she could not ignore.

				Since leaving Krakow she had not lived among Jews; 					neither, until the problem with the Park Avenue apartment building, had 					discrimination brought her Jewishness home to her. It was true that her 					Jewishness enforced certain business imperatives. When she set up her first 					American branches they were in cities where Jews were accepted, such as San 					Francisco, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Atlantic City; she left strongholds of 					anti-Semitism such as Boston, Washington, Palm Beach, and Newport to her goyishe 					rival Elizabeth Arden, whose business was distinctly WASP-oriented. But she felt 					no personal affinity with Jews—rather the contrary. She had refused to live on 					New York’s Upper West Side because it was “too Jewish,” and disliked the French 					Riviera, the preferred playground of her rival Estée Lauder, for the same 					reason.

				It looked, for a while, as though this distancing 					would survive even World War II. When, toward the end of the thirties, Marc 					Chagall asked her for some money to help relatives escape from Germany, she told 					him to try elsewhere. And when war broke out she followed her usual practice and 					left for distant parts, taking an extended cruise with Artchil to Central and 					South America. Everything, including real estate, was wonderfully cheap there, 					and she took the opportunity to establish branches in Buenos Aires, Rio de 					Janeiro, and Panama. She was soon, she happily told the New 						York Times, doing “astounding” business.22 Over the following four years she went back twice, eventually, as 					always, placing relatives in charge of the new offices.

				But as the war dragged on, even Madame had to 					recognize that being Jewish enforced perspectives and priorities rather 					different from those she had hitherto preferred. She urged all those members of 					her family who still remained within Hitler’s reach to leave while they could, 					with the promise of jobs wherever they might choose to settle. Her sister Stella 					went to Argentina, and a great-niece named Regina was sent to Australia. But the 					sister after whom that Regina had been named, the only one of Helena’s 					generation not to have left Krakow, refused to budge and was killed in the death 					camps.

				Regina’s death was a turning point for Helena. She 					threw herself wholeheartedly into the war effort, becoming a booster for War 					Bonds and organizing concerts on behalf of the Polish Red Cross. She had always 					been unenthusiastic about the Germans, furious during World War I when her 					German-sounding name had led people to accuse her of being pro-German herself. 					“Poles hated always the Germans. . . . I am really upset. I got a 					letter . . . which mentioned that some letters were received from 					England re my pro-German feelings and so on. Fancy I wish them going to hell, 					excuse the expression, I hate the sight of them. . . .”23 Returning now from one of her trips to South 					America, where so many Nazi war criminals would soon find shelter, she assured 					the New York Times that among all the people she 					met, the Germans were universally unpopular, “and even when it was hard to get 					servants many people would not engage a German cook.’’ She “estimated that 90 					percent of the Argentine people were ‘really our allies.’ ”24

				When the war ended, she became a keen supporter of 					the new State of Israel (which she always called Palestine). “I’m going to build 					a museum and a factory in . . . in? Not Jerusalem but the other town,” 					she told Patrick O’Higgins in 1958.

				“Tel Aviv?”

				“Yes, that’s the place.”

				Feted as a big donor, she sat through any number of 					tedious receptions, and finally met Israel’s then foreign minister, Golda Meir. 					Surveying Mrs. Meir’s craggy features, she remarked disapprovingly on the 					minister’s lack of makeup. Then the two formidable ladies got down to 					business—in English, although Yiddish was in both cases their mother tongue.

				“Madame Rubinstein, what do you think of our 					country?” Mrs. Meir asked.

				“If I plan to build a factory and a museum, I must think highly of it.”

				“Which do you think is the more important?”

				“The factory!”

				“I agree!”25

				And with that simple exchange, the stage was set 					for the drama to come.

I

				On April 1, 					1965, Helena Rubinstein relinquished her avid grip on life. In a memoir 					published the previous year she had for the first time admitted her real 					birthdate. She was ninety-two years old.

				Until a year before her death, Madame had remained 					in active, some thought hyperactive, charge of her business. But on the morning 					of May 21, 1964, she was surprised by thieves in her New York triplex. They 					gained entry by pretending to deliver a flower arrangement, then tied up the 					butler at gunpoint and made for the main bedroom, which they expected to find 					empty. Madame, however, was no longer an early riser. On the contrary, she liked 					to conduct much of her business from her bed. At eight thirty a.m. she was 					eating her breakfast toast, prior to conferring with her secretary and publicity 					adviser.

				Presented with the traditional choice—her money or 					her life—she retorted that at her age she didn’t care if they killed her, but 					she was damned if they were going to rob her. At which point she realized that 					her keys—including the keys to her safe and the filing cabinet in which she kept 					her jewels—were in her purse on the bed, under the intruders’ noses.

				Fortunately the purse was buried deep in papers, 					and the thieves were by then busy emptying drawers and disconnecting phones. 					Madame silently extracted the keys and with characteristic presence of mind 					dropped them in the one place she could be sure no one would ever look: down her 					ample bosom. By the time the thieves noticed the purse it contained only some 					handfuls of paper, a powder compact, five twenty-dollar bills, and a pair of 					diamond earrings worth around forty thousand dollars. The earrings rolled away 					as they upended it, and Madame covered them with a Kleenex. One of the thieves 					grabbed the money. “Your friend took a hundred dollars out of my purse. See that 					you get your share,” she admonished his friends. Furious and frustrated, aware 					that time was passing and that other household members would soon arrive, they 					ripped off her bedcovers, tore the sheets in strips and tied her to a chair, 					before fleeing with their negligible loot. And there, screaming at the top of 					her still-considerable lungs, she was found by the butler, who had managed to 					break free of his own bonds. After he freed her, Madame instructed him to put 					the thieves’ roses in the icebox, in case there should be company for lunch. She 					calculated that after paying $40 for the roses, they had made just $60 profit on 					their morning.1

				Madame was justifiably proud of her sangfroid. But 					the shock drained her, and she never recovered either her confidence or her 					health. As always when faced with a crisis, she took refuge in motion, traveling 					from New York to Paris, on to Tangiers and evenings of bridge with such of the 					ancient International Set as still survived (“If you add up the combined ages 					round this table we’re back in the sixteenth century,” quipped one of the 					players, at which Madame snapped “Don’t—until you’ve paid the ten francs you owe 					me!”), back to Paris, on to Normandy, which held sentimental memories of her 					romance with Edward Titus, a stop at Saint-Cloud, where she had established her 					first French factory (“It’s where I was always happiest,” she sighed, “in my 					kitchen, my laboratory”). Then she returned to New York, suffered a stroke, and 						died.2

				Helena Rubinstein’s death liberated a small 					mountain of possessions. Her estate was variously estimated at between $1 					million and $100 million, depending on what was counted in. The American 					business alone grossed over $22 million a year.3 Officially, it was publicly owned, but in fact Madame personally 					held 52 percent of the shares—worth around $30 million—as she had done ever 					since the Lehman Brothers maneuver. The Park Avenue triplex was rented, in a 					move that would surely have appalled her, to Charles Revson of Revlon, an 					upstart whose name she had always refused to utter, referring to him only as 					“the nail man.” Her will, when it was read, contained 121 individual 						bequests.4 But that was just the property: 					gowns, jewels, pictures, real estate. The business was not so easily disposed 					of. The industry that she had founded in one room and a “kitchen” was by the 					time of her death the tenth-most important in the United States, just behind 					rubber. Helena Rubinstein, Inc., had become an empire. Where would it end 					up?

				For her American competitors, the problem was 					easily solved. The business would be sold, and one of them would buy. 					Particularly keen was a firm called Cosmair. Set up in 1953, Cosmair, although 					nominally independent, was part-owned and effectively controlled by L’Oréal, and 					was L’Oréal’s sole U.S. licensee. The person appointed to run it by Schueller, 					John Seemuller, was half-American—he was the person who had performed those 					risky missions for the firm in France during the war, using his American 					passport to run forbidden items across the border between the occupied and 					nonoccupied zones. The Cosmair job may have been Schueller’s way of showing his 					appreciation. But Seemuller did not appreciate how tricky it might be to 					penetrate the American market, and made little headway.

				Seemuller’s incompetence frustrated François Dalle, 					who was keen to extend L’Oréal’s reach into the huge market of the United 					States. He was also anxious to broaden L’Oréal’s range to include cosmetics, 					whose sales, as women cast off housewifery and flooded into the workplace during 					the 1960s and early seventies, were rising at an average of 10 percent a year. 					One of Dalle’s first acts on taking over as CEO was therefore to appoint his own 					man to head Cosmair: the suave and charming Jacques Corrèze, who had been vice 					president of L’Oréal’s Spanish subsidiary, Procasa. Corrèze was good at both 					administration and business, and was particularly good with money. Seemuller had 					quickly run through all the cash Paris allowed him, to little effect; Corrèze, 					Dalle remembered, was “close with his—which was to say, our—pennies.”5

				In 1965, when Helena Rubinstein died, Cosmair was 					still small. It had only twenty employees, producing and distributing L’Oréal’s 					hair-care preparations to beauty parlors. But Corrèze had made a point of 					getting to know Madame—he was just the sort of man she liked, smooth, 					cultivated, and full of Old World charm—and when she died, he was determined 					that if anyone took over Helena Rubinstein, Inc., it would be Cosmair. At the 					end of the war, French manufacturers, who since 1940 had enjoyed a market in 					which anything they produced was snatched from the shelves, had been rocked by 					the sudden influx of unaccustomed competition from America. Now it was L’Oréal’s 					turn to extend its reach into America.

				Helena Rubinstein, however, was not for sale. 					Although the American branch was publicly quoted, all its other branches (except 					the English business and its South African and Far East subsidiaries, which were 					the property of a foundation set up to avoid inheritance taxes) remained 					privately owned. The company was now managed by Madame’s son, Roy Titus, and her 					nephew and niece, Regina’s son and daughter Oskar Kolin and Mala Rubinstein, who 					were reported to have metamorphosed “from depression to a vibrant 						pragmatism.”6 Released from Madame’s beady 					eye and unsettling tendency to descend unannounced and bawl out all those 					present, they were enjoying the unaccustomed pleasures of self-rule.

				But those pleasures did not last, for they did not 					get on. Indeed, the experience of Helena Rubinstein, Inc., as it declined after 					its founder’s death (in marked contrast to L’Oréal, which continued from 					strength to strength under Dalle) might have been designed to prove Eugène 					Schueller’s theory that business and family were best kept separate. Although 					Madame had always assumed that “the family” would carry on the business after 					her death, she had never trained a successor. That would not only have meant 					admitting her own mortality, but would have run the risk of transferring too 					much of her own power to someone else, something quite alien to her autocratic 					character.

				Instead, she had encouraged rivalries. Although Roy 					was her firstborn, she had never taken him seriously, preferring his younger 					brother, Horace, whose only real interest in the firm while he was alive (he 					predeceased his mother, much to her anguish) had been as a source of cash. Her 					real business partners had been Oskar, a sharp accountant who did any necessary 					dirty work and was known to all as the Lord High Executioner, and his sister 					Mala, of whom she had been fond, and whom Roy bitterly resented. “She enjoys 					it,” her long-time secretary, Ruth Hopkins, said, she “plays one against the 						other.”7 But all this was secondary—for 					Madame, and nobody else, made the decisions: as she had liked to say, “I am the business.” The inevitable upshot was that her 					death left an unfillable void at the business’s center. Once the firm’s living 					trademark and main motive power had vanished, all that remained was a disunited 					boardroom with no clear strategy.

				By 1972, the family had had enough and decided to 					sell. The buyer, Colgate-Palmolive, paid $146 million: more than twenty times 					earnings. But Colgate soon regretted its purchase. The overseas businesses, 					which continued to operate much as before, remained profitable. But the American 					arm soon began to lose money. Colgate’s idea had been to integrate the 					Rubinstein product range into its existing marketing operation. But as Madame 					could have told them had she still been around to do so, high-end beauty 					products require special sales techniques, different from those that sell 					everyday necessities like soap and toothpaste. By 1978, Helena Rubinstein’s 					losses were estimated at $22 million, and its debts at $50 million. Colgate had 					had enough, and Helena Rubinstein was once more for sale.

				In early 1979, KAO, a Japanese toothpaste business, 					was reported to have offered $75 million for it. Later that same year, L’Oréal 					was again in the picture, the price now having dropped to $35 million. But 					neither sale materialized. In 1980, however, Colgate finally offloaded its 					unwise acquisition. The buyer was a privately owned concern, Albi Enterprises, 					the price $20 million, plus a Colgate guarantee for up to $43 million in bank 						loans.8 Albi quickly recouped its outlay by 					selling off Helena Rubinstein’s mass-market lines and its American headquarters. 					By 1985 the company’s only American employees were a dozen people in a New York 					office. They spent their days consolidating international financial statements, 					and no longer had any idea who they worked for.

				Cosmair, by contrast, was doing very well. During 					the 1970s, Dalle had pushed L’Oréal’s U.S. subsidiary into high gear, investing 					heavily in research and identifying profitable niches in what the industry 					jargon called a “maturing” market. Some of this success was down to deep 					pockets: L’Oréal, and hence Cosmair, was now part-owned by the Swiss foods giant 					Nestlé. But Cosmair also had a dynamic new managing director of its own. Dalle, 					like Schueller before him, was looking out for a suitable successor, and had 					recently identified him in the person of Lindsay Owen-Jones. In 1985, Dalle 					planned to retire. There would follow a short interregnum, when the firm would 					be run by its head of research, Charles Zviak, after which, in the autumn of 					1988, “O-J” would become L’Oréal’s CEO. In the meantime he was put in charge of 					Cosmair.

				Arriving in New York in 1981, Owen-Jones won a 					reputation as a ruthless and aggressive player in an increasingly tough market. 					In 1983, Cosmair staged a brilliant coup, buying up the entire European stock of 					aerosol cans in preparation for the introduction of its Free Hold hair-styling 					mousse. The mousse became terrifically popular, and since Cosmair owned all the 					aerosol cans, no one could compete until they had found another source, which 					did not happen for several crucial months. Magazines that failed to place 					Cosmair’s ads in what O-J considered the best spots had the company’s 					advertising withdrawn. And the company ferociously, and successfully, jockeyed 					for counter space in department stores and other outlets. By 1984, Cosmair’s 					sales had tripled, to $600 million.

				Meanwhile, L’Oréal had not given up its ambitions 					regarding Helena Rubinstein, which was becoming weaker by the day. In 1983, 					following a Rubinstein family quarrel, a L’Oréal subsidiary had quietly acquired 					Helena Rubinstein’s Japanese and South American branches. And in October 1988, 					HR’s U.S. employees discovered, when they read the papers, that they had a new 					owner. Cosmair had bought Helena Rubinstein, Inc., including the European 					branches, for “several hundred million francs” (the franc was then valued at 					about ten to the pound sterling, and about seven to the dollar) in what the 					business press described as “a shrouded deal.”9 					It made L’Oréal the biggest cosmetics business in the world, and put Jacques 					Corrèze where he had long wanted to be—in the chair of Helena Rubinstein.

				“Nothing ever happens at L’Oréal—it’s really 					boring, nothing but bigger and bigger profits,” a financial analyst told Le Monde in June 1988.10

				It would not stay boring long.




II

				In February 					of 1988, eight months before the purchase of Helena Rubinstein was completed, 					L’Oréal learned, to its “utter astonishment,”11 					that it had been placed on the blacklist of the Arab League’s anti-Israel 					boycott committee. The committee, whose offices were located in Damascus, had 					been set up in 1948, when the State of Israel was established, in an attempt to 					strangle the new state by cutting off all Arab trade with companies linked to 					Israel, or doing business with it. This proved rather an empty threat at first, 					but took on new force after oil prices quadrupled in 1973, leaving oil-producing 					countries with huge surpluses of petrodollars that made them highly desirable 					trading partners.

				L’Oréal had for many years maintained subsidiaries 					in Egypt, Syria, and Palestine. But although no company likes to face the 					prospect of losing an entire segment of the world market, it might in principle 					have ignored the boycott committee. Indeed, in principle it had no option but to 					do so, since complying with the boycott had been outlawed in France in 1981, at 					the start of President Mitterrand’s first term. L’Oréal, however, was not the 					only company involved. In 1974, Liliane Bettencourt had exchanged a large block 					of her L’Oréal shares for shares in the Swiss food conglomerate Nestlé—a company 					of which Dalle, when he retired in 1984, had become vice president. All these 					shares were now owned by a holding company, Gesparal, of which Liliane 					Bettencourt owned 51 percent and Nestlé 49 percent, and which itself owned 53.65 					percent of L’Oréal. And if Nestlé, as part owner of L’Oréal, were to become 					involved in the boycott, that would be serious indeed: Arab markets accounted 					for 15 percent of its milk products exports.12

				On the face of it, L’Oréal’s astonishment at being 					singled out by the boycott committee was logical. Helena Rubinstein did have an 					Israeli subsidiary—but L’Oréal had, as yet, no official ties with HR. In 					reality, however, the committee’s announcement came as no surprise at all, nor 					had the boycott committee suddenly acquired the gift of prophecy. This affair 					had been rumbling on ever since L’Oréal’s 1983 acquisition, through a 					subsidiary, of Helena Rubinstein’s Japanese and South American businesses. The 					boycott committee had told L’Oréal then that it was taking a risk, since the 					Rubinstein parent company had strong Zionist ties, but L’Oréal had set its 					sights on Helena Rubinstein and refused to be put off. On the contrary, the 					following year, 1984, they discreetly, and via another subsidiary, bought 45 					percent of Helena Rubinstein, Inc., from Albi; and that same year, they sold off 					HR Inc.’s Israeli subsidiary to Israeli nationals in an attempt to head off the 					boycott threat. In 1985, however, the boycott committee announced that it was 					still not satisfied. L’Oréal indignantly riposted that it was not the owner of 					Helena Rubinstein—which indeed it was not. And there matters rested—until 					1988.

				L’Oréal had two problems. The first was that French 					law forbade it to deal with the Arab boycott committee. The second was that its 					ties to Israel, far from being cut, had recently been strengthened.

				The first problem was annoying but not 					insurmountable. L’Oréal had for years been conducting discreet negotiations with 					the boycott committee. Now it dispatched France’s one-time ambassador to the 					United Nations, Claude de Kémoularia, to represent it in Damascus. M. de 					Kémoularia was a particularly apt choice, as he knew the people concerned: when 					President Mitterrand first outlawed all dealings with the boycott, it was 					Kémoularia who had been deputed to convince the Arab leaders that they would 					have to accept this new stance. Now he returned with a (to them) much more 					acceptable message, and was soon back in Paris with the boycott committee’s 					conditions. Among them was a stipulation that L’Oréal must either buy the whole 					of Helena Rubinstein or drop all links with the company; that all Israeli 					manufacture of Helena Rubinstein products must be stopped, along with all Helena 					Rubinstein activity in that country; and that all existing directors of Helena 					Rubinstein be removed and replaced (it was understood, by non-Jews: this was 					when Jacques Corrèze became HR’s chairman).

				Since L’Oréal was anyway about to finalize the 					total purchase of Helena Rubinstein, Inc., Corrèze, who was in charge of the 					Israeli end of these negotiations, was dispatched to offer the Israeli buyer of 					the business in that country a manufacturing deal in Germany that would be far 					cheaper than maintaining an Israeli factory. The Israelis were happy to accept 					this offer, and were also persuaded to drop the name “Helena Rubinstein” for the 					preposterous reason that if the firm was to be L’Oréal’s Israeli agent, there 					was no reason to use this particular brand name. It was agreed that HR Israel 					would henceforth be known as Interbeauty. Only the paperwork remained to be 					finalized.

				But just as the Helena Rubinstein problem seemed to 					have been settled, a new one arose. Although François Dalle was no longer CEO of 					L’Oréal, he still maintained ties with the firm, heading its strategy committee. 					L’Oréal had money to invest—in 1987 its net profits had for the first time 					topped the billion-franc mark—and in 1988 Dalle, looking for profitable ways to 					invest it, had done a deal with an old friend, Jean Frydman. Frydman, the son of 					Polish-Jewish parents who had emigrated to Paris when he was five, had known 					Dalle for thirty years. They had met soon after the war, in which Frydman had 					been a daring résistant, and had been good friends 					ever since. One of Frydman’s enterprises, CDG, owned a valuable catalogue of 					film rights, including the non-U.S. rights to High 						Noon, Citizen Kane, and other movie 					classics. It was agreed that L’Oréal would form a joint venture with CDG called 					Paravision, and that Frydman would sit on its board.

				The Paravision deal was only a few weeks old when 					Dalle realized that it might raise problems for L’Oréal. Dalle had thought 					Frydman lived in Canada, where he owned a ranch, but in fact he now spent most 					of his time in Israel, and was domiciled in that country. And although the 					boycott committee’s conditions regarding Helena Rubinstein had been met, the 					final removal of L’Oréal from the blacklist had not yet been signed and sealed. 					That would not happen until the end of 1989. Meanwhile, in Damascus and Paris, 					multiple copies of questionnaires and affidavits languished on bureaucrats’ 					desks or got lost in embassies awaiting signature, and more and more generous 					sub rosa sweeteners to intermediaries were required, and envoys expensively 					shuttled back and forth, and nothing was settled. In the spring of 1989, 					therefore, Dalle suggested to Frydman that it might be a good thing if he 					temporarily stepped down from the joint venture’s board.

				Thus far, both Dalle and Frydman agreed that this 					was the way things were. As to what happened next, however, they disagreed 					bitterly.

				Dalle said Frydman had not objected to resigning 					temporarily from the Paravision board, and had even had a letter of resignation 					prepared by one of his aides. Frydman, on the contrary, insisted that he had 					objected, and strongly: he had no wish whatever to accommodate the Arab boycott 					committee. Despite this, however, his resignation was offered and 					accepted—without his knowledge—at a board meeting held, also without his 					knowledge, in April of 1989.

				That he had known nothing about the meeting was not 					surprising, since investigations revealed that it had never taken place. L’Oréal 					at first tried to deny any such maneuver, then admitted that that was indeed 					what had happened. But such proceedings were apparently not unusual. Notional 					board meetings, fleshed out later on paper, were, Dalle insisted, quite normal 					in France.

				However, Frydman was in no mood to listen to feeble 					excuses. For he had made another disturbing discovery. It concerned Cosmair’s 					Jacques Corrèze, who as the original instigator of the Helena Rubinstein deal 					was deeply involved in the boycott negotiations. Frydman knew Jacques Corrèze—or 						a Jacques Corrèze—only too well. While the 					fifteen-year-old Frydman had been escaping deportation and risking his life with 					the Resistance, Jacques Corrèze had been Eugène Deloncle’s loyal lieutenant in 					MSR—not merely propagating its hateful doctrines but actually leading the gangs 					who took possession of properties once owned by Jewish families like the 					Frydmans. After the war he had been disgraced and condemned to ten years’ hard 					labor. Could this Corrèze be the same person?

				He could, and he was. This one-time Jew-baiter not 					only held an important position in a leading French company but was now engaged 					in the ethnic cleansing of an American Jewish firm whose takeover he had 					engineered. He had even had the chutzpah to visit Israel, several times, to 					negotiate the sale of Helena Rubinstein’s Israeli branch and the closure of its 					manufacturing operation there. It was Corrèze, Frydman declared, who had wanted 					him removed from the Paravision board. He was determined to expose L’Oréal’s 					fascist and racist connections, and show the world how it conducted its 					affairs.

				Dalle was apoplectic. He insisted that not only had 					he never been an anti-Semite, but that Frydman’s real aim in raising these 					irrelevant, if embarrassing, matters, was financial: to blackmail L’Oréal into 					conceding a better settlement regarding Paravision than they were prepared to 					offer. “Frydman’s using the Shoah to make himself some money, and that’s the 					beginning and end of it,” Dalle declared,13 a 					remark he later regretted, but did not retract. At L’Oréal’s 1991 annual general 					meeting, its new CEO, Lindsay Owen-Jones, gave shareholders a long explanation 					of its antiracist principles. His speech was met with “ringing applause,”14 and the company’s unions, including one that 					was Communist-led, issued a statement confirming that in all their dealings with 					L’Oréal and Dalle they had never been aware of any racism.

				Frydman admitted that the Paravision affair had 					done him no harm financially. On the contrary, he emerged 200 million francs to 					the good—by no means negligible, though far less than he had asked and less than 					he had hoped for.15 But he was infuriated by 					Dalle’s insinuations (repeated by L’Oréal’s vice president, André Bettencourt) 					that money was his real concern in this affair. “There are three things he 					regards as sacred,” his brother, David, said, “his family, Israel, and the 						Resistance.”16 And L’Oréal, by employing 					Jacques Corrèze, had insulted two of them.




III

				Just as the 					boycott committee’s interest in L’Oréal had not exactly been a total surprise, 					so Jean Frydman’s revelations regarding Jacques Corrèze’s previous life were not 					news to L’Oréal’s senior management.

				Corrèze’s last public appearance in France had been 					in October 1948, when he had been chief defendant in the Cagoule trial, which 					had been postponed when war broke out but not canceled. For a while it had 					seemed as though the trial would be postponed indefinitely, for the enormous 					dossier of relevant papers—more than two tons of them—had vanished. There was a 					rumor that just before the Germans arrived in Paris in 1940 the papers had been 					sent for safekeeping to Lesparre in the Gironde, the constituency of Georges 					Mandel, then minister of the interior. But after the Liberation, when the 					examining magistrate traveled there from Paris to find them so that the 					prosecution could proceed, no one at the Lesparre Palais de Justice could help 					him.

				The magistrate was about to return to Paris 					empty-handed when someone suggested that the concierge, who had been there 					throughout the war, might know something. As it turned out, she did. One night 					in June 1940, a party of men had arrived with a load of boxes which they hid in 					the washrooms. The boxes had been stacked up at one end, a wooden partition 					erected to conceal them, and the concierge sworn to silence. Then the men left. 					She had never said a word, but as far as she knew, everything was still where 					they had put it. Sure enough, there, behind a heap of assorted odds and ends, 					was the partition—and there, behind it, were the Cagoule papers: damp and 					stained, but still legible. In October 1945, those of the seventy-one accused 					who could be located were politely requested to present themselves at police 					stations. Fifteen obliged, and forty were eventually tried: amongst them, 					Jacques Corrèze.

				Corrèze’s story, as he told it to the court, was a bizarre mix of 					thuggery, courtly love, and melodrama. He was, a reporter noted, “dark and 					romantic-looking, extremely courteous and remarkably intelligent”; he affected 					“a hand-on-heart frankness”17—but did not, in 					the end, reveal much. He told the court that before the war his father had been 					an interior decorator in Auxerre, where the Deloncles had a country house. In 					1932 they decided to do the place up: Jacques went to look it over—and fell 					under their spell. “I was nineteen, and I fell deeply in love with Mme. 					Deloncle,” he testified. He insisted, however, that their relations had remained 					platonic. He joined the household as a sort of additional son, and lived with 					them from then on. But although Deloncle inducted him into La Cagoule, and later 					the MSR, he insisted that he had played little part in their policymaking. “I 					was just a soldier, they weren’t going to share the secrets of the gods with a 					boy like me!”18

				The truth, as it emerged from the documents, was 					rather different. Corrèze had been no minor figure in “Monsieur Marie’s” 					clandestine universe, but had been his chief aide and confidant in both La 					Cagoule and MSR. His dossier contained an envelope with all the keys of the 					Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, and maps of how to get to the 					minister’s private office, for use during the planned coup d’état of 1937. 					During the Occupation, “Colonel” Corrèze, whose group marched the streets of 					Paris in high boots, tunics, and cross-belts, oversaw expropriation operations, 					received reports from concierges and neighbors when the buildings were taken 					over, and made inventories of their contents. Among these was the building in 					the rue du Paradis that had housed the Ligue Contre Antisémitisme, where, 					subsequent to Corrèze’s “liberation” of it, the fascist Charbonneau so enjoyed 					returning to his cozy office after MSR meetings chez L’Oréal in rue Royale. Its 					filing cabinets, desks, chairs, safes, stepladders, were all carefully 						listed.19 And alongside the highly 					profitable expropriation business, rumors held that Deloncle had set up a 					“parallel” police to extort money from Jewish entrepreneurs, with Corrèze as its 					chief enforcer.20

				However, in the middle of 1941, when the Germans 					abandoned the Nazi-Soviet pact and marched on Moscow, Deloncle lost interest in 					expropriations. The most important task as he now saw it was to join the fight 					against the Bolsheviks. He therefore set about raising a French volunteer force 					to fight in Russia alongside the Germans. The Légion de Volontaires Françaises 					(or LVF) was perhaps the extreme point of the collaboration. Of little 					consequence militarily (only 3,205 volunteers signed up), it had considerable 					psychological importance, allowing French fascists to feel that the Germans 					really valued them as partners. Corrèze, Deloncle’s loyal protégé, was one of 					the first to sign up. He spent the hellish winter of 1941–42 on the Russian 					front, failing to take Moscow, and returned in April 1942.

				By then, however, the MSR was in disarray. For now 					that German victory seemed less certain, Deloncle was rethinking his position 					vis-à-vis collaboration. Unseated in a putsch by the assassin Jean Filliol, he 					opened contacts with the Americans, hinting that he was working with the résistant (and ex-cagoulard) General Giraud. The 					German army was already less than enthusiastic about him on account of a 					mini-Kristallnacht he organized in October 1941, when his men blew up seven 					Paris synagogues using explosives supplied by the Gestapo—a gesture that may 					have pleased the Berlin high command but appalled the Wehrmacht because it 					needlessly antagonized the French, without whose cooperation, or at least 					indifference, the Occupation would become much harder to sustain. Deloncle was 					becoming a liability.

				On January 7, 1944, he was dealt with. At seven 					thirty that morning, the concierge of his apartment building in the fashionable 					16th arrondissement was awakened by repeated knocking on the door. She opened it 					to find fifteen civilians armed with machine guns, some speaking perfect French, 					others with heavy German accents. They ordered her to go up to Deloncle’s 					apartment via the service stairs. They would follow. She was to ring Deloncle’s 					bell and say it was the gas meter reader. On the stairs, however, the party met 					Lucienne, the Deloncles’ maid. She opened their door with her key, and the armed 					men found themselves face-to-face with the Deloncles’ son Louis and a manservant 					holding a breakfast tray. Louis shouted, “Papa! 					Papa! 					Des terroristes!” and Deloncle appeared, wearing 					only his pyjama jacket. He left the room to get his pistol; the armed men 					followed. There were a number of shots. When the men left, Deloncle was dead, 					and Louis had a bullet in his head, leaving him permanently disabled.

				Corrèze, who still lived with the Deloncles as one 					of the family, and who was standing naked in the hallway when the posse burst 					in, threw himself to the ground as soon as the shooting started, and escaped 					unharmed. He and Mercédès Deloncle, with whom he was still in love, were 					arrested and imprisoned, but released after a few days. Mercédès then vanished, 					not reappearing until more than a year later, when her daughter Claude married 					Guy Servant, an LVF stalwart and the son of a pro-Nazi friend, Patrice 					Servant.

				Corrèze, for his part, abandoned politics following 					the assassination and went underground to join a Resistance network. This 					volte-face counted in his favor when it came to the épuration: he was sentenced only to ten years’ hard labor. At the 					end of the Cagoule trial he received a further ten years, to run concurrently 					with the first sentence.

				He was freed in 1949, when an amnesty was 					announced: the three years he had already served before the Cagoule trial were 					judged to count as part of his sentence, making him eligible for freedom as this 					meant he had served five years in all, 50 percent of his sentence. However, 					prison was not his only punishment. Like many collaborators, including Mercédès 					Deloncle, whom he married as soon as he was freed, he had also been sentenced to 						dégradation nationale (public disgrace) and 					confiscation of all his property in France, past, present, and future. He turned 					to the man at once most likely to sympathize with him and most able to help: his 					old friend from the MSR, Eugène Schueller. Schueller had, after all, employed 					François Mitterrand, whose brother was married to Mercédès’ niece. And Schueller 					did not disappoint him.

				In fact, it was not Schueller who officially hired 					Corrèze, but François Dalle. Dalle insisted he did so without any input from 					Schueller. He thought Corrèze had paid his debt to society, his sentence was 					“not amongst the most serious,” and “as a participant in the Resistance, I 					thought it was important to demonstrate tolerance at a time of reconciliation in 						France.”21 But like so many of the 					pronouncements emanating from L’Oréal after Frydman’s revelations, this left 					much unsaid. For Corrèze was by no means the only cagoulard to find salvation at 					L’Oréal after the war. It was rumored that even Jean Filliol, who had been 					sentenced to death in absentia on three separate counts and had lived the rest 					of his life on the lam, was among them (though one scandal sheet hinted that 					Filliol didn’t actually have a L’Oréal job but was living on blackmail money 					extorted during a clandestine trip to Paris in 1946).22 Indeed, it was common knowledge in certain circles that Schueller 					“looked after his own” and “could be relied on to fish out people who were going 						under.”23

				Of course this was hardly surprising. Schueller had 					only by the narrowest of margins, and by a concerted effort on the part of 					influential friends, escaped the punishments meted out to so many of his wartime 					colleagues. The least he could do was to help the less fortunate as he himself 					had been helped. Just as Helena Rubinstein’s business success had allowed her to 					provide a refuge from the Jew-hunters, in the shape of far-flung employment, for 					her nieces, nephews, sisters, and brothers-in-law, L’Oréal allowed Schueller to 					do the same for Deloncle’s band of brothers. Jean Filliol’s son and daughter, 					using their mother’s name of Lamy, took a job with L’Oréal’s Spanish subsidiary, 					Procasa, as did the son of Michel Harispe, Corrèze’s confederate in Jewish 					expropriation, and Deloncle’s brother and son.1

				Corrèze, like the other ex-cagoulards, followed the 					well-trodden route to Franco’s Spain, where a sympathetic regime allowed them to 					start life afresh. But unlike most of them, for whom this exile was little more 					than an afterlife, he took his work seriously and put all his considerable 					energy and charm into making a success of it. Sent to the United States in 1953, 					“he visited all the New York hairdressers with his little bag of samples, 					selling our hair dyes.”24 Within a few years 					Corrèze was heading a sizable organization, had become an important figure in 					L’Oréal, and was considering the purchase of Helena Rubinstein, Inc. His 					subsequent negotiations in Israel were congenial on both sides. “They knew all 					about my past,” Corrèze said (somewhat of an exaggeration: what he told the 					Israelis was that he was not proud of his past during World War II, and that 					they should not bruit his name about because “then he wouldn’t be able to help 						anymore”25). He found them “delightful 						people.”26 And this liking was wholly 					reciprocated. “He was a big man, very warm and charismatic. You really wanted to 					please him,” said Gad Propper, the Israeli businessman who dealt with him.27

				In 1959, Corrèze was officially amnestied, and in 					1966 he was rehabilitated. He could once more participate in French life and own 					property there. From then on he lived between the Bahamas and Paris, where his 					apartment overlooking the Seine was described by those who knew it as 					“palatial.”

				But although his past was now officially expiated, 					it lived on in the minds of those Corrèze and his friends had hunted. Deeds that 					the perpetrators recalled only with great difficulty remained vivid in their 					victims’ memories. Serge Klarsfeld, the indefatigable French lawyer and 					Nazi-hunter, had amassed a large collection of papers pertaining to the Nazi 					persecution of the Jews in France, among them several documents attesting to 					Corrèze’s anti-Semitic wartime activities. In the wake of Frydman’s accusations, 					Klarsfeld passed these papers on to the American Office of Special 					Investigations, so that the Justice Department could decide whether or not to 					place Corrèze on its special watch list of foreigners believed to have 					participated in religious or racial persecution.

				The affair was now getting seriously embarrassing 					for L’Oréal, and on June 25, 1991, Jacques Corrèze resigned from the company. He 					was seventy-nine years old and suffering from cancer of the pancreas: on June 					26, the day after his resignation, he died. A short statement was issued in his 					name. “I cannot change what has been. Allow me simply to express my most 					heart-felt and sincere regrets for the acts that I may have committed 40 years 					ago, and their consequences, however indirect.”28




IV

				At the same 					L’Oréal annual meeting, in 1991, where Lindsay Owen-Jones had been cheered when 					he rejected any taint of racism, André Bettencourt, L’Oréal’s vice president, 					had reiterated Dalle’s contention that Jean Frydman’s real concern was 						financial.29 Infuriated, Frydman vowed he 					would not rest until Bettencourt had been forced to retract and, hopefully, was 					hounded out of L’Oréal.

				His task was not, on the face of it, easy. Since 					the war, Eugène Schueller’s group of young friends from 104 had done 					spectacularly well—and become spectacularly influential. By 1991, when the 					Corrèze scandal broke, François Dalle had become one of France’s industrial 					elder statesmen; Pierre de Bénouville was (among other things) second-in-command 					to Marcel Dassault, né Bloch, the aviation magnate; 					François Mitterrand was well into his second term as president of France. As for 					André Bettencourt, he had become not only a powerful political figure but 					immensely rich. He had been a valiant résistant, 					with the Resistance Medal and the Croix de Guerre 1939–45, with palms, to prove 					it. He was a senator, and had been many times a minister under presidents of 					both the right and the left—in the Foreign Ministry during the presidency of 					Pierre Mendès-France, a minister under General de Gaulle, and a cabinet minister 					under Georges Pompidou, who had been not just president but a close friend, as 					was François Mitterrand, the current holder of that office. And he was one-half 					of France’s wealthiest couple: the fortune inherited by his wife on her father’s 					death had grown. She was now France’s richest woman.

				Frydman was undeterred. In 1994, after reading 					Pierre Péan’s book Une Jeunesse française, which 					revealed the far-right connections and dubious youth of Bettencourt’s friend 					Mitterrand, he thought he would do some basic research himself—starting with the 					weekly columns Bettencourt had written for La Terre 						Française between December 1940 and July 1942. On the rare occasions 					Bettencourt had been confronted with his authorship of these pieces he had 					played them down as being harmless, unimportant contributions to an obscure 					farming magazine. But was that true? It should be easy enough to find out: the 					Bibliothèque de Documentation Internationale Contemporaine at the Nanterre 					campus of the University of Paris had a set of copies. Frydman’s brother David 					went to have a look at them.

				His first finding was that La 						Terre Française was by no means as innocuous as Bettencourt implied. 					It might have been, once, but during the Occupation it had been taken over by 					the Germans, acting through a small company called “Le Comptoir financier 					français.” This was wholly financed by the Nazi Propagandastaffel and in 1949 					suffered the fate narrowly avoided by Eugène Schueller, of having its assets 					confiscated as punishment for aiding the enemy. The magazine’s contents were a 					careful mix of agricultural articles and general-interest hearts-and-minds 					pieces designed to appeal to a deeply conservative and distrustful section of 					the population.

				Bettencourt’s column Ohé les 						jeunes! was a mix of religious and political uplift geared to the 					Church calendar and the changing seasons. The pieces appeared between December 					1940 and June 1942, and were featured prominently, sometimes taking up the 					entire front page. And what they contained was dynamite. Bettencourt’s public 					image was founded on his being an old résistant and 					a pillar of the Republic. But his wartime writings promoted a down-the-line 					antidemocratic pro-Nazi agenda. “All the old formulas of excessive liberty” must 					be abandoned: “the words democracy, dictatorship, republic, universal suffrage, 					organized proletariat, liberty, equality, have had their day.”30 Denunciations of suspect neighbors were a duty 					“insofar as they truly serve the community.”31 					As for the Jews, “rubbing their hands [after the crucifixion, they] cried, ‘Let 					his blood fall on us and our children!’ You know exactly how it fell, and still 					falls. The edicts of the eternal Scriptures must and will be accomplished.”32 And, if this material were not graphic enough, 					“Their race is forever stained with the blood of the just. They will be 					universally accursed. . . . Today’s Jews . . . will be spat 					out [seront vomis]. It’s already happening.”233

				All these prejudices had long been familiar to the 					devotees of Action Française, and it was no surprise 					to find them voiced by an ambitious young man of Bettencourt’s religious and 					conservative background. His generation had never seen the Republic as anything 					but enfeebled and corrupt; for the circles in which he moved, the Jews embodied 					everything—liberalism, secularism, cultural dilution—that was destroying their 					beloved France. For forty years these same prejudices had been brandished in an 					ongoing and increasingly bitter war of words. Bettencourt was simply repeating 					what he had heard all his life.

				However, it could hardly have escaped this highly 					intelligent young man that by the time he wrote his pieces the war was no longer 					a war of mere words. On the contrary, in the context of the Nazi Occupation, the 					familiar phrases had become lethal weapons. The extolling of denunciation was 					particularly sinister—not just repellent in itself, but because it laid a duty 					on readers to impose what was probably a death sentence upon anyone who did not 					conform to the ruling ideology.3 And to denigrate the Jews in an era of 					deportations, expropriations, and extermination camps, was direct incitement to 					persecution.

				Bettencourt’s first intimation that Frydman had 					disinterred his articles and was preparing to publish them was at a symposium on 					museum management he was moderating. When questions were invited, David Frydman 					stood up and said he was proposing to fund a museum of the collaboration. He had 					a set of Bettencourt’s articles for La Terre 						Française. Would Bettencourt agree to donate the manuscripts to 					Frydman’s museum?

				Later, Bettencourt would try to pretend that he 					could not remember what he had written all those years ago, and that in any 					case, his articles had been anodyne and unimportant. But his reaction to 					Frydman’s intervention indicated that, on the contrary, he remembered only too 					well, and knew the effect disclosure might have on his current image. The shock 					was palpable. He turned pale and left the room. When he returned, he was urged 					by a member of the panel not to answer, but rejected this suggestion with the 					words “I am a public figure, I must answer.” He went on: “It is true that I had 					the misfortune to write for La Terre Française, but 					I redeemed myself. I was in the Resistance. I even represented the National 					Council of Liberation at Geneva.”34

				Bettencourt at once used his powerful position as a 					senator to try to prevent the matter going any further. When Frydman returned to 					the library to make sure he had photographed everything, he found that all 					copies of La Terre Française had vanished. He looked 					elsewhere, in vain: the magazine had been removed from every library in 					France—except the Bibliothèque Nationale’s Versailles site, where he finally 					tracked it down. It had recently been moved there from the library’s then main 					building in rue Richelieu, probably escaping Bettencourt’s sweep because at the 					crucial moment it was in transit between locations.4

				In the autumn of 1994, Jean Frydman set out his 					findings in a pamphlet, Pour servir la mémoire, 					giving the names and details of the old fascists “recycled” by Schueller and 					reproducing the more explosive of Bettencourt’s Terre 						Française articles. The result was all he had hoped, and all 					Bettencourt had dreaded. Not only was there a renewed focus of attention on 					L’Oréal’s dark history, both in the French press and in other countries, but 					Serge Klarsfeld requested the U.S. Department of Justice to put Bettencourt on 					its watch list of undesirable aliens. That listing in turn prompted New York 					congressman Eliot L. Engel to write Bettencourt a letter demanding clarification 					on three counts. How had he been able to obtain an American visa, given that 					applicants were required to state whether they had been implicated in any Nazi 					persecutions? What about those articles, now republished by Frydman, from La Terre Française—in particular one containing the 					phrase “Today’s Jews will be spat out. It’s already happening”? And had 					Bettencourt, during the war, been a collaborator or a résistant?

				Bettencourt declined to respond to Frydman’s 					allegations, on the grounds that the conflict between Frydman and L’Oréal was 					still before the courts, and that as vice president of L’Oréal he was debarred 					from commenting. But he did reply to Congressman Engel’s letter. He had no 					memory of filling in a visa application form, as he normally used a diplomatic 					passport; in any case, he would not fill in such a form himself—tasks like that 					were the job of his staff. As a résistant, he had 					been imprisoned in Nancy and had met Allen Dulles, head of the American OSS, 					while on a mission to Switzerland. He had been asked to write for La Terre Française because he had previously been 					active in the Catholic young farmers association (Jeunesse Agricole Catholique), 					and this was a farming magazine. He had been France’s official representative at 					the funeral of Israel’s David Ben-Gurion, when he had been received by Golda 					Meir and Abba Eban, hardly a mission for an anti-Semite. Nor would anyone with a 					record of collaboration have been tolerated by de Gaulle or Mendès-France, who 					had not only been a staunch résistant but was 					himself Jewish. He held the Resistance Medal. His son-in-law was a Jew. He 					rested his case. As for Mr. Engel’s citation of a phrase about the Jews being 					“spat out,” supposedly published in the Christmas 1940 edition of La Terre Française, he assured him that no such phrase 					appeared in that article. Indeed, it did not: it turned out that Frydman’s notes 					were in error. The phrase had appeared the following Easter, in a piece, also by 					Bettencourt, entitled “Carillon pascale.”

				Frydman’s pamphlet, and its repercussions, prompted 					investigations into other aspects of André Bettencourt’s wartime life—in 					particular, his claim to have been active in the Resistance. He had undeniably 					been awarded the Resistance Medal, but for what, exactly?

				In his letter to Congressman Engel, Bettencourt 					wrote that in 1944 he had been sent to Geneva to represent the Conseil National 					de la Résistance. There, under the assumed name of Grainville, he had contacted 					many members of the Resistance and also members of the English and American 					intelligence services, in particular Allen Dulles and Max Shoop of the OSS, on 					behalf of the Ministry for Prisoners of War. He returned to France with Dulles 					at the time of the Allied landings in the south of France.

				But these claims did not stand up to examination. 					It was true that Bettencourt did go to Switzerland in the summer of that year. 					Mitterrand had tasked him with contacting American agents in Switzerland in 					order to obtain funds on behalf of the Ministry for Prisoners of War, which was 					trying to foment unrest in German prisoner-of-war camps. Once he had the money 					he was to pass it on to Mitterrand.

				It was not a hard task, and he accomplished it 					easily enough, making the requisite contacts and forwarding the money—$2,500,000 					in all,35 though what became of it is unclear. 					No POW insurrections of the type it was supposed to fund were recorded. However, 					he certainly did not, as he claimed, represent the Conseil National de la 					Résistance. That organization was headed by Jean Moulin and General de Gaulle, 					who were convinced that America’s ultimate intention was to turn France into an 					American client state, and forbade all contact with the American secret services 					in Switzerland, particularly in financial matters. When confronted with this 					faux pas by the satirical weekly Le 					Canard Enchaîné, Bettencourt backtracked: he had 					made a mistake, he had actually been part of the delegation of the Mouvements 					Unifiés de la Résistance—a different and much less significant body, headed by 					his old friend (and Jean Moulin’s mortal enemy) Pierre de Bénouville. But it 					transpired that this position, too, was impossible: the MUR had ceased to exist 					on December 31, 1943,36 nine months before 					Bettencourt visited Switzerland.

				Nor did he meet Allen Dulles: Bettencourt’s 					dealings were with Dulles’s deputy, Max Shoop.37 And even had Dulles and Bettencourt been acquainted, they could 					not have journeyed to France together. Dulles did not leave Switzerland until 					the night of August 29–30, while Bettencourt told Pierre Péan in an interview 					that from August 21 he was in Paris, where he and Dalle were helping Mitterrand 					with post-Liberation policy regarding prisoners of war.538

				Bettencourt’s first line of defense was to insist 					that everything about his past was known and had long been dealt with and 					dismissed. “I answered the questions about La Terre 						Française in my very first electoral campaign,” he told New York’s 					Congressman Engel. And some years later, interviewed for a book, he said, 					“Everyone knew perfectly well what my position was during the war.”39 When this tack failed to impress, he declared 					that although he regretted what he had written, it was insignificant: “I 					mentioned the Jews two or three times and the freemasons once. 						. . .”40 And finally he pleaded 					ignorance. He had not known what was happening to the Jews: “I would never have 					written those words if I’d had any idea of what the Jews were going through. 					. . . No one knew anything about Jews being arrested and deported to 					extermination camps,” he complained to an interviewer.41 Nor had he had any idea who the real owners of La Terre Française were: “I knew absolutely nothing 					about that. . . . For me it was just a magazine with a large 					circulation among agriculturalists.” 42 And 					when all these excuses failed, he simply went into denial. When confronted with 					yet another outrageously anti-Semitic, antidemocratic article written for yet 					another Pétainist youth publication (L’Élan, 					published in Bordeaux), “I don’t remember,” he flatly replied.43

				None of it worked. The Frydmans’ revelations ended 					Bettencourt’s public career. On December 13, 1994, he quietly resigned from 					L’Oréal (where he was replaced as vice president by his son-in-law, Jean-Pierre 					Meyers, by a supreme irony a Jew whose grandfather had died in Auschwitz) and 					declared he would not be standing in the Senate elections due to take place the 					following year. He insisted that these decisions had nothing to do with the 					Frydmans’ investigations or Congressman Engel’s letter, which he made a point of 					not having received until December 16, three days after his resignation. On the 					contrary, he said, L’Oréal’s CEO, Lindsay Owen-Jones, had been aware for some 					time of his impending departure: at the age of seventy-six he could no longer 					fulfil his duties as actively as he should, and from now on he would have to 					curtail his activities. But sources “close to L’Oréal’s management” told Le Monde that, on the contrary, the letter and the 					resignation were by no means unconnected. The troubles stemming from the Corrèze 					affair were only just behind them, and they were anxious that this new 					embarrassment should remain confined to Bettencourt himself and not taint the 					company or its principal shareholder, who was, of course, his wife.44

				The tone Bettencourt took thereafter, on the rare 					occasions when he consented to speak about the affair, was one of sadness and 					indignation. He was, he asserted, the victim of a malicious conspiracy. But “the 					more I say, the more I stoke the polemic. . . . It’s all a terrible 					trap,” he complained to Le Monde. “Have some 					consideration for my dignity. It’s appalling to imply that I could possibly have 					participated in genocide!” 45 And writing to 					Congressman Engel he reiterated the accusation that had so enraged Jean Frydman 					when he had first made it, saying that in his view, “this sudden revival of 					interest in articles . . . written half a century ago is at least 					partly due to the misrepresentation of events by people who want to make sure 					their financial interests prevail.” 46




V

				It seems 					clear that neither André Bettencourt nor Jacques Corrèze felt guilty about what 					they had done during the war. Their regret was rather for the embarrassment 					their youthful acts caused them later. But that regret manifested itself quite 					differently in the two men, and had different roots.

				Bettencourt’s chagrin clearly stemmed from the 					sense that he had been unfairly picked out. Countless others—including, 					doubtless, many of his own acquaintances—had acted as discreditably as he. Even 					if they had not, as he had, actively promoted fascism, they had adjusted their 					lives to it without too much trouble. But the épuration was supposed to have dealt with all that. One of its 					important functions had been to act as an “exercise in the suppression of 					memory,” 47 so that France could step forward 					into the future, confident that the worst offenders had been punished. For 					private individuals, this amnesia took effect almost instantly. Thus, the 					journalist Merry Bromberger, profiling Schueller in 1954—only six years after 					his second trial—glossed over his wartime career with the comment “From time to 					time his enthusiasms have led him where he shouldn’t have gone.” 48

				All this meant that when Bettencourt said, 					“Everyone knew perfectly well what my position was during the war,” the truth 					was in reality just the opposite. People thought they knew—and wanted nothing more than to go on 					thinking so. No one in the French establishment welcomed his exposure. It 					undermined the whole edifice. If Bettencourt was shown to be a liar, whose story 					could be believed?

				For what made the Bettencourt case so disturbing 					(and what so infuriated him) was the certainty that it was not unique. His 					shameful trajectory had, after all, only been revealed by the sheerest chance. 					If Corrèze had not become obsessed with taking over Helena Rubinstein, if the 					Boycott Office had not intervened, if Dalle had not picked Jean Frydman as a 					partner for L’Oréal, none of his wartime activity would have come out. It was 					possible that the fates had picked the one rotten apple out of the 					barrel—possible, but not probable. What of the industrialists who had so 					enthusiastically funded La Cagoule, and whose names still remained household 					words in France? Would their stories, had they been forced to reveal them, have 					been so very different? And how many public figures had, like Bettencourt 					himself, transformed themselves into résistants at 					the last minute—as his friend François Mitterrand put it, “mal embarqués, bien arrivés”?49 					Were not their careers based, as his was, on lies and concealments?

				One of the people most anxious that Frydman should 					not pursue his vendetta to the bitter end was Mitterrand himself. “This story 					has gone too far,” his aide Charles Salzmann told David Frydman. The president 					didn’t want the affair discussed in the press because they might write “all 					sorts of things.”50

				But it was too late: they already had. As more and 					more of the L’Oréal story seeped out, Mitterrand’s many detractors seized upon 					the Schueller connection, pointing up his far-right relations and questioning 					whether he had played the important part in the Resistance that he had always 					claimed. In particular, they pounced upon a decoration he had played down: the 					Francisque, the medal awarded for outstanding service to Vichy and Pétain. 					Mitterrand could hardly deny receiving it—when his party went into opposition, 					in 1962, the Gaullist deputies amused themselves by shouting “Francisque! 					Francisque!” whenever he rose to speak51—but he 					had hitherto explained it away by saying “When I received it in 1943, I was in 					England [i.e., on Resistance business]. That was really useful when I got 					back—it was the best possible alibi.”52 Now, 					however, when people looked into the issue more closely, they found that a 					photograph existed of him receiving the medal in person from the Marshal’s own 					hand.

				That Mitterrand should have been part of Vichy was 					no surprise. Of all the gang from 104, his background was probably the furthest 					right, and his family was intertwined, in many ways and on many levels, with La 					Cagoule. Not only was his sister, Marie-Joséphine, for many years the lover of 					Jean Bouvyer, who was involved in the Rosselli assassination, but the 					Mitterrands were actually related to the Deloncles via Mitterrand’s brother, 					Robert, whose wife was Mercédès Deloncle’s niece. During the days of La Cagoule 					and the MSR, the Mitterrands cut off contact with the Deloncles, but after 					Deloncle was killed they looked after his daughter, Claude, and her young 					children. And when, in 1949, Mercédès Deloncle finally married her long-time 					love Jacques Corrèze, the Mitterrands were present in force at their wedding. In 					1984, when President Mitterrand, visiting New York, attended a party at the 					Hotel Pierre in New York given by the local French community, Corrèze’s friends 					and colleagues were astonished to see the president greet him with a warm 						hug.53

				But the point about Mitterrand’s far-right 					connections, which he so fervently did not wish exhumed, was that they had never been secret. When he first emerged as a 					leader of the left, during the 1950s, the political scandal sheets made much of 					this sudden volte-face. “Our aim here isn’t to determine the exact relations 					between M. Mitterrand and La Cagoule: everyone knows that that monster (by which 					of course we mean La Cagoule) had many heads and thousands of feet. We merely 					note that it’s odd that an eminent member of the UDSR [Mitterrand’s party] 					should be mixed up in the intrigues of [cagoulards] . . . who managed, 					during the Occupation, to construct a Vichyist/Gaullist/collabo/résistant synthesis before which 					the most persistent bloodhounds would lose heart,” commented one in 1953; in 					1954, another invoked “the political waters in which Mitterrand first met his 					friend Schueller, the father-in-law of Bettencourt, who’s now a minister.”54 And the same was true of Jacques Corrèze. If 					anyone wanted to look, his beginnings with L’Oréal were an open secret. The 					latter article went on to mention “the cagoulard Jacques Corrèze, who owes his 					job in Madrid to Schueller . . . .” And later, as Lindsay Owen-Jones, 					Dalle’s successor, said quite plainly, “This is not a guy who tried to hide in 					Argentina or Brazil. He never changed his name.”55 It was all out there—if you wanted to know it.

				The truth was that most people did not want to 					know. They wanted to look forward, not backward. In the words of Mitterrand’s 					Socialist Party colleague Laurent Fabius, whom he had made France’s 					youngest-ever prime minister, “What did I care what he’d done thirty years 						ago?”56 François Dalle, for instance, knew 					all about Corrèze, but decided to employ him nonetheless. In Dalle’s eyes, he 					had paid his debt to society. “As a participant in the Resistance, I thought it 					was important to demonstrate tolerance at a time of reconciliation in 						France.”57

				But, then, neither Dalle nor Owen-Jones had ever 					suffered at the hands of Corrèze and his like. Those who had were not so blithe 					about letting bygones be bygones. And France’s problem, in the postwar years, 					was that the two sides—the victims and the rest—could never agree as to the best 					way forward. One side wished to move on, the other—for whom closure was 					impossible unless the past was recognized—could not move on until it had seen 					justice done. The L’Oréal affair exhumed this split, which was why so many 					people found it so painful.

				This problem was not unique to France. In one form 					or another it affected many countries after the war. But what made the French 					situation particularly edgy was that anti-Semitism had for so many years been 					one of the mantras of the anti-Republican right—and that for many, the 					differentiation this implied between French Jews and the “real” French had never 					really been effaced. Thus, in 1980, when a bomb exploded at a synagogue in 					Paris’s rue Copernic, the then prime minister, Raymond Barre, commented, “This 					disgusting attack was aimed at the Jews who were going to the synagogue, but it 					actually injured innocent Frenchmen who were crossing the street.”58 If as late as 1980, in the mind of a moderate 					politician, Jews and “innocent Frenchmen” were still instinctively 					differentiated, then it was clear just how embedded in the national psyche 					Action Française’s demonization still remained.

				Obviously, there were real differences between a 					Bettencourt, who simply blew with whatever wind prevailed, and a Corrèze, who 					had been a committed Nazi and who made a point of insisting that he had always 					acted on principle. The Senator Bettencourt of 1994 probably was genuinely 					different from the young man he had once been, just as the climate of postwar 					opinion was genuinely different from that in which he had been brought up. 					Admittedly his career was based on lies. But by the time Frydman resuscitated 					them he had told the official story so often that he had probably come to 					believe it. Had he truly been that young fascist cheerleader? His reaction to 					David Frydman’s revelations showed that he knew he had. But how could that young 					man have turned into the person he was now? Was it really he who had inveighed 					against “the republic and her masks of parliamentarianism and liberalism,” he 					who had called for “a leader who commands, not a crowd of clerks eternally 					discussing”? 59 It was impossible—yet it was 					true. A journalist who spoke to him on the phone after his resignation said he 					sounded “wounded and tormented.”60 “There’s 					this incredible atmosphere of hate,” Bettencourt said.

				I had to withdraw from 						the only occasion I’ve been offered to put my side of things on television. 						. . . because I found out they were going to accompany it with 						images of the Germans marching up the Champs-Élysées. . . . You 						just have to put up with it; every time you talk about it you just fall into 						another trap. To say I’m an anti-Semite is shameful when my only daughter is 						married to a Jew who’s like a son to me. After fifty years of an existence 						devoted to my country, am I only to be seen as an anti-Semite and 						anti-Freemason? It’s horrible.61

				No such bitter regret was ever felt by Corrèze. He 					had never, as Bettencourt had, suppressed the person he had once been. On the 					contrary, he insisted that he did what he did when the MSR was in its prime “for 					a noble cause,” haughtily declaring that although he had lost faith in the MSR 					some time before Deloncle died, he had not abandoned his old mentor while he 					lived because “I do not desert my friends.”62 					Had his views changed simply because they were no longer admissible? It seems 					unlikely. Rather, his whole life had been a continuation of the same game, and 					when that game was exposed, he was not so much embarrassed as furious.

				Naturally, he never went so far as to publicly 					glory in his past. When first questioned about his role in expelling 					Jews—including Georges Mandel, who until June 1940 had been minister of the 					interior, and Bernheim the well-known art dealer—from their homes and 					businesses, he, too, resorted to evasion, first denying everything. “I can’t 					recall it—I don’t think that can be true,” he said first, then insisted that 					there was a difference between what he had done and actually maltreating Jews 						(“faire des saloperies contre les juifs”).63 Which was true enough: he had waited for 					others to do the dirty work, and then taken the profits. A few days later he 					issued a written statement asserting that “There’s no one, among those hunted 					during the Occupation, Jewish or not, who can complain of having suffered, in 					his person or his goods, from my activity.”64 					But in the end his actions were what they were, and he did not apologize for 					them.

				The characteristic that struck reporters during the 					Cagoule trial in 1948 was his arrogance. He sat aloofly at the end of the row, 					leaning away from his fellow accused, his handsome head thrown back, viewing the 					proceedings from a distance down his well-shaped nose. He answered questions, 					when addressed, with a weary politeness. He was, journalists remarked, a 					romantic figure. He was also utterly unrepentant. And unrepentant he remained. 					Interviewed on television in June 1991, he was asked, “Do you feel you were a 					real anti-Semite?” to which he flashed savagely back, “I don’t know if I was, 					but I’m about to become one!”65

				He did not, like Bettencourt, try to cheat the 					gods. Rather, in a classic tale of hubris, he simply gave them the finger, 					pushing his luck, because he felt himself invincible. Given his past, and his 					defiant arrogance, it is hard to believe that Helena Rubinstein’s Jewishness 					played no part in Corrèze’s absolute determination to acquire her business. He 					never showed any interest in the very comparable Elizabeth Arden, who was an 					equally powerful player, who died only a year after Madame, and whose business 					went downhill in much the same way as Helena Rubinstein’s. On the contrary, it 					seems in character that, having arrived in New York and sized up the situation, 					he should have decided to resume the old game he had so enjoyed in Paris—Colonel 					Corrèze redivivus, minus only the high boots and cross-belts. Everything he did 					points to his enjoyment of this underlying drama, his pleasure doubtless 					enhanced by the fact that only he was aware of it.

				We have no way of knowing when he first set his 					sights on Helena Rubinstein’s business, but since Madame was already over eighty 					when he arrived in New York, he must have realized even before he met her that 					Helena Rubinstein, Inc., would come into play sooner rather than later. He made 					a point of getting to know her; and to good effect. Dalle testified that it was 					Corrèze’s personal friendship with Madame that enabled L’Oréal to acquire Helena 					Rubinstein Spain—the first step to the eventual takeover of the entire 						company.66 When the boycott difficulties 					arose, it was he who insisted on conducting the Israeli end of the negotiations. 					He dropped hints to the Israelis regarding his past—which helped convince them 					that he was an honest broker—but as at the Cagoule trial this apparent 					frankness, whose effect was so disarming, in fact concealed far more than it 					revealed. And as the saga of the boycott became more and more tangled, his 					behavior became increasingly flamboyant. At one point he floated a crazy plan 					that might have come from Deloncle himself: a project called Operation Rocher to 					create a bogus company in Switzerland, apparently quite unconnected to L’Oréal, 					that would buy the Helena Rubinstein international operation.67 He would control 					Helena Rubinstein—at, it seemed, any cost—and ended up occupying its chair in 					the same way as, during the war, he and his MSR cronies occupied the one-time 					offices of the Ligue Contre Antisémitisme, Georges Mandel’s apartment, and the 					Bernheim art gallery. Would anyone realize who he was? Would they make the 					connection? Eventually, of course, someone did. And then he defeated them after 					all—by dying.




VI

				The story 					of L’Oréal’s takeover of Helena Rubinstein, and the ensuing explosions, is an 					almost perfect dramatic construct. Had it not been for the vicious anti-Semitism 					of Schueller and his friends, Madame would never have rediscovered her Jewish 					identity and established the Israeli presence that gave rise to the boycott 					problems. Had Jacques Corrèze not been disgraced in France as an old Nazi he 					would not have ended up in New York, nor been so enchanted by the prospect of 					taking over a Jewish business. His and Schueller’s eventual unmasking was a 					direct, if unforeseeable, consequence of their previous actions.

				For the businessman who had to deal with the 					consequences, however, the scandals were nothing less than a nightmare. Lindsay 					Owen-Jones, L’Oréal’s fourth CEO, assumed office in the autumn of 1988—just at 					the moment the boycott storm broke—and spent the next six years firefighting, as 					successive news stories rose from the dead to rip through L’Oréal’s image.

				A large part of his effort to repair the damage was 					directed at the reestablishment of that image with the Jewish community and 					Israel. American reaction to the boycott settlement had been angry, and L’Oréal 					faced a $100 million lawsuit alleging it had broken U.S. laws designed to 					prevent American firms from cooperating with the Arab boycott of Israel. In June 					1994, therefore, L’Oréal announced that it had bought a 30-percent stake in 					Interbeauty (formerly Helena Rubinstein Israel) at a price of $7 million. Six 					months later, in January 1995, the company opened a factory in the Israeli town 					of Migdal Ha-Emek, producing Elseve shampoo, Plenitude antiwrinkle cream, and a 					line of products for export using Dead Sea minerals, called Natural Sea Beauty. 					That same year, L’Oréal agreed to pay $1.4 million to the U.S. government to 					settle its legal problems, and thanked the Anti-Defamation League “for its 					support of L’Oréal’s business and community services activity in Israel.” 					Bettencourt had resigned, Corrèze was dead, the Jewish lobby was happy. In 1997, 					the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America gave L’Oréal its 					International Leadership Award. Owen-Jones heaved a sigh of relief and prepared 					to turn his attention to other matters.

				And then, in 2001, ten years after the Corrèze 					affair, six years after Bettencourt’s exit, the Nazi past returned to haunt 					L’Oréal once more.

				In the 					freezing winter of 1948, Eugène Schueller announced to his protégé François 					Dalle that they were going to visit L’Oréal’s German subsidiary, which had its 					headquarters in Karlsruhe, just across the Rhine from Schueller’s native Alsace. 					The company had opened its first German agency in Berlin, in 1922, but it did 					not do as well as expected, and its manager, Frau Kuhm, refused to produce her 					account books. In 1930 L’Oréal sacked her (to her fury—she sued, but lost) and 					opened another office under the management of a Frenchman, André Tondu.68

				The Berlin premises were destroyed during the war, 					and after it Tondu, who remained in charge, moved the business to Karlsruhe. 					There, under the name Haarfarben und Parfümerien (Hair Dyes and Perfumery) he 					rented the ground floor and cellar of a house in the center of town, at number 					18, Kaiserallee. The business at that point was “Lilliputian,” Dalle remembered: 					its “factory” consisted of the cellar room, an area of about 300 square 						meters.69

				When the business needed more space, in February 					1949, Tondu signed purchase papers on its behalf for a property situated just 					round the corner, at 17, Wendtstrasse. This house and the one at 18, 					Kaiserallee, shared a common neighbor, number 19, Wendtstrasse, a once-luxurious 					mansion that had been bombed during the war, and which occupied the corner lot 					where Wendtstrasse met Kaiserallee. If Tondu could consolidate, and buy this 					property also, his business would then occupy an important and valuable site in 					the center of town.

				In November 1951, he seemed to have received some 					assurance that he would indeed, sooner or later, be able to buy number 19. That 					month, Haarfarben bought the house at 18, Kaiserallee, whose ground floor and 					basement it had hitherto been renting—a move that only made sense if they now 					knew they would also be able to buy the ruined lot situated between the two 					properties they owned already. And in 1954 they duly did so.

				The seller was a large insurance company, the 					Badischer Gemeinde Versicherung Verband (BGV), which had acquired number 19 in 					1938 from a Frau Luise Dürr. The property, however, was not owned by Frau Dürr. 					Rather, it belonged to the family of a wealthy lawyer named Dr. Fritz 					Rosenfelder in whose name she was acting. Until 1936, Dr. Rosenfelder had lived 					there with his mother-in-law, his wife, Kaethe, and their young daughter, Edith. 					But the family was Jewish, and by the end of 1936 they knew they would have to 					leave Germany. Dr. Rosenfelder spoke French and had studied in Paris, and he 					therefore decided to move his family to that city, traveling on ahead to look 					for accommodations. They would join him there as soon as he had found somewhere 					suitable for them all to live.

				By the time he was ready to receive them, however, 					the situation in Germany had deteriorated further. For Jews to leave was no 					longer a straightforward matter. There was now invariably a price to pay: in the 					Rosenfelders’ case, this included their house. They would need exit visas, and 					to obtain them, Dr. Rosenfelder was told he must designate an agreed Aryan to 					handle all his business in Germany—which meant transferring “all the rights” to 					this person, including the right to dispose of property.70 The holder of this power of attorney would be 					Frau Dürr. Dr. Rosenfelder had never met her and knew nothing about her. No one, 					least of all an experienced lawyer, would willingly sign over his property to 					such a person in this way. But as it was the only way to get his family out of 					danger, he signed.

				The family duly came to Paris and in September of 					1938 moved into an apartment in the rue des Saussaies, near the Champs-Élysées 					(as it happened, just across the road from where the Gestapo would establish its 					headquarters). Meanwhile, on January 20, 1938, Frau Dürr transferred rights in 					number 19, Wendtstrasse on behalf of Dr. Rosenfelder “once of Karlsruhe, now of 					New York,”71 to BGV.

				For the Rosenfelders, as for so many Jewish 					families, the war was a time of unspeakable torment. In 1939, Dr. Rosenfelder 					was sent by the French to the first of a series of internment camps, where food 					was scarce and living conditions atrocious.6 During 					intervals of freedom he managed to get visas for his family to emigrate to 					America, but his mother-in-law refused to go: America, she declared, had no 					culture. By 1941, however, it was clear that Paris, though doubtless cultured, 					was no longer safe for Jews. Fritz Rosenfelder was interned once again, this 					time at Les Milles, near Aix-en-Provence, and Kaethe, Edith, and Kaethe’s 					mother, Emma, decamped to Allauch, a small town not far away, where they lodged 					with a family and Edith went to school.

				So things went on for some months. Then one day, 					when Edith chanced to be at the beach with her teacher, her mother and 					grandmother were picked up by the milice. They were 					sent to the infamous internment camp at Drancy, a staging post for Auschwitz, 					where they died. Edith was saved by a young village girl who arrived before the 					gendarmes could find her, and who helped her hide.

				Fritz, meanwhile, had escaped from Les Milles. When 					he heard what had happened, he realized there was no way of retrieving his wife 					and mother-in-law. He and his daughter made their perilous way to Switzerland, 					where, weakened by his successive ordeals, he died in 1945. Edith, then 					seventeen, ended up in a camp for Jewish displaced persons, where she stayed 					until an uncle who had made it to Brazil agreed to take her in. She traveled to 					Brazil, married there, and had two children. But she could never bear to talk 					about the war, or her dead mother and grandmother. She told her children she 					didn’t remember.72

				In 1951, the year Edith Rosenfelder married, BGV 					took full legal possession of 19, Wendtstrasse. Until 1949, regulations imposed 					by the victorious Allies had prevented any dealing in property stolen from the 					Jews by the Nazis. But on January 1st of that year these restrictions were 					lifted, and in August 1950, BGV began the process of establishing their legal 					right to number 19. In the absence of living claimants, all such matters were 					decided via the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO), based in New 					York.

				There were, of course, living claimants: not just 					Edith Rosenfelder, but an uncle, Fritz’s brother, Karl Rosenfelder, who was then 					still alive. And it seems that Karl Rosenfelder was trying to lay claim to his 					family’s property. But BGV made no effort to contact him—on the contrary: an 					internal memorandum dated June 4, 1951, records that a lawyer had phoned to say 					that Karl Rosenfelder had been in touch with a view to establishing his right to 					restitution of the property, but that if the matter could not be settled by 					negotiation via the JRSO, he (the lawyer) would not pursue the matter, as he had 					no wish to act against his friends in BGV.73 As 					it turned out, this man had been chairman of the Association of National 					Socialist Lawyers for Karlsruhe during the 1930s and was personally responsible 					for the banning of Fritz Rosenfelder from practicing. He was unlikely, to say 					the least, to have been an enthusiastic advocate for Fritz’s brother Karl.

				The matter was settled, without reference to either 					Karl or Edith Rosenfelder, on November 5, 1951. On that day, BGV agreed to pay 					JRSO 5,000 deutschmarks as compensation, in return for ownership of the lot at 					19, Wendtstrasse.74 Later they claimed that 					Karl Rosenfelder had signed the document, but neither they nor anyone else have 					ever produced his signature.

				Meanwhile, André Tondu’s property purchases on 					behalf of Haarfarben progressed in close step with BGV’s. In January 1949, as we 					have seen, the restriction on dealing in stolen Jewish properties was lifted, 					allowing BGV to begin the formalization of its ownership of 19, Wendtstrasse. In 					February, Tondu made the first of his purchases—number 17, Wendtstrasse. And he 					bought the property at 18, Kaiserallee on the very day—November, 5, 1951—that 					the BGV/JRSO matter was settled, that same day reconfirming his purchase of 17, 					Wendtstrasse.

				Two and a half years later, on June 29, 1954, the 					Wendtstrasse saga was completed—at least as far as Tondu and Haarfarben/L’Oréal 					were concerned. That day Tondu, on behalf of Haarfarben, bought number 19 from 					BGV for DM 27,000. The transfer document noted that a restitution procedure had 					been initiated concerning ownership of this property, but that the file had been 					closed, entitling the present owner [BGV] to dispose of the property.75 Haarfarben/L’Oréal now owned the entire corner 					site at the junction of Kaiserallee and Wendtstrasse. They would remain there 					for the next thirty-seven years, selling the property in 1991 (the same year, as 					it happened, that the Corrèze scandal broke).

				Edith Rosenfelder, now Edith Waitzfelder, living in 					Rio de Janeiro, knew nothing of these maneuverings. But her daughter, Monica, 					noticed that the other Jewish families they knew in Rio, many of whom had 					arrived there in circumstances very similar to Edith’s, had all received 					restitution payments from Germany. Edith had received nothing; and although she 					hated talking about her family’s life in Germany, and what had happened to them, 					she said enough to indicate that they had been well-off and had owned a 					substantial property in Karlsruhe. Why, then, had she been neglected? What had 					happened to her rightful compensation?

				Monica Waitzfelder determined to find out. She 					moved to Paris, found a job there, and set about unraveling her family’s German 					affairs.

				The task, which she carried out in the intervals of 					her busy life as an opera director, turned out to be difficult and complex. 					Papers that should have been available somehow could not be found. Bureaucrats 					were unhelpful. A clause in the November 5, 1951, agreement by which BGV 					acquired 19, Wendtstrasse, for example, stated that “The JRSO undertakes, 					inasmuch as the defendant (the BGV) acts in conformity with instructions from 					the JRSO, to compensate the defendant to a maximum of 5,000 DM if a situation 					arises where those with a priority right make themselves known and validly 					undermine the defendant’s position.”76 But when 					Waitzfelder made inquiries regarding this clause, she was informed that the 					compensation had already been paid, and the matter was closed. Yet how was this 					possible? No one but Edith, her uncle Karl having now died, had a priority 					right, and she had never made herself known to JRSO, since by the time she found 					out what was going on in Karlsruhe, the JRSO no longer existed.

				“L’Oréal is still very powerful [in Karlsruhe],” 					was the explanation offered by one nervous and unhelpful woman at the Karlsruhe 					town hall when asked why she could not supply copies of the relevant documents. 					Bit by bit, however, Monica Waitzfelder accumulated the documents and pieced 					together the story. The 1954 papers recording BGV’s sale of 19, Wendtstrasse to 					Haarfarben stated that “The compensation rights owed to victims of the war 					remain entirely within the possession of the vendor.” That was to say, BGV—the 					people who had illegally acquired the property in the first place.

				On June 18, 2001, Maître Charles Korman, acting for 					Monica Waitzfelder, wrote to Lindsay Owen-Jones, managing director of L’Oréal, 					detailing what his client had uncovered. Valuations of sales and rental income 					for comparable properties indicated that the Waitzfelders had been cheated, over 					the years, of a substantial sum. The amount named by Korman was DM 60,556,726, 					(roughly, €30,000,000, or $40,500,000). He made it clear that both he and Ms. 					Waitzfelder would prefer an out-of-court settlement, but failing that they would 					go to court.

				However, in letters to the lawyer and, later, to 					Edith and Monica Waitzfelder, Owen-Jones rejected all notion of a settlement. He 					declined to acknowledge that L’Oréal had any responsibility in the affair, 					asserting that Haarfarben was quite distinct from L’Oréal and that L’Oréal had 					not bought a majority holding in it until 1961. If strictly true in a legal 					sense, in practice the company always regarded the German subsidiary as part of 					the parent organization. There is particular mention of Haarfarben as part of 					the L’Oréal family in staff magazines from 1948 and 1949, while a paragraph in 					L’Oréal Deutschland’s website describes how André Tondu restarted the business 					in Karlsruhe after it was bombed out of Berlin.

				Owen-Jones insisted that the JRSO transaction of 					1951, in which due compensation had been awarded, had been signed by Karl 					Rosenfelder (though he, too, failed to produce any signature). He declared his 					“deepest conviction . . . that L’Oréal has done no wrong to Mrs. Edith 					Rosenfelder,” and announced that L’Oréal had appointed its own lawyers to deal 					with the case. They were Michel Zaoui and Jean Veil, two well-respected Jewish 					advocates, one of whom (Zaoui) had been a leading prosecutor in the Klaus Barbie 					trial—a choice whose insulting implications were not lost on the 						Waitzfelders.77 Owen-Jones had clearly been 					advised that the law was on his side, and, that being so, he was not inclined to 					give in.

				L’Oréal did indeed win the case, both at the first 					hearing, when the Waitzfelders’ complaint was declared out of time, and later, 					to Korman’s great surprise, on appeal. But it is still hard to understand why 					Owen-Jones decided to fight rather than settle. From a publicity point of view, 					it would surely have been better for L’Oréal to portray themselves as prepared 					to right old wrongs rather than as legalistic skinflints upholding shameful Nazi 					theft. The Waitzfelders would doubtless have settled for less than the stated 					sum—not that €30 million would bankrupt a company of L’Oréal’s size and wealth. 					In 1988, Capital magazine calculated that the 					Bettencourts, its main shareholders, were getting richer at the rate of €14.2 					million a day, or €590,000 an hour, while in 2001 					their share of the company’s dividends amounted to more than €81 million.78 As Owen-Jones presided over year after year of 					double-digit growth, the share price rose from $8 in 1990 to $76 in 2000. When 					he took charge, Liliane Bettencourt, the company’s largest shareholder, was 					already the wealthiest woman in France; he made her the wealthiest woman in the 					world.

				From its very inception, however, Owen-Jones’s 					tenure as L’Oréal’s CEO had been marked by rumblings from the Nazi past. When he 					took charge, in 1988, the Frydman affair was just about to explode. He spent 					seven years negotiating his way through that minefield, and succeeded in 					extricating his company without ever once actually admitting the various 					allegations. Perhaps the Waitzfelder case was simply one too many for him. To 					settle would be to acknowledge that L’Oréal really was tainted; and that, 					perhaps, was more than he could bring himself to do.

				Whatever his motivation, the result has been hard 					on the Rosenfelder family. Edith Rosenfelder still lives, in difficult 					circumstances, in Brazil. Monica Waitzfelder has told her lawyers not to contact 					her unless they have good news to offer, as she otherwise finds the whole affair 					too upsetting. At the time of writing, she had not heard from them. The case is 					still unresolved, and it is before the European Court of Human Rights.

Conditions for Nazi prisoners of 							war in France were rumored to be—and were—far superior. (Koestler, Scum of the Earth, pp. 92, 114.)

				Consumers or 						Consumed?

				For 					Owen-Jones, it is easy to see how these political scandals must have seemed like 					a never-ending, irritating diversion from his main job. These years saw the 					transformation of L’Oréal from a national treasure into a multinational giant. 					And from that point of view, the acquisition of Helena Rubinstein did what it 					had been intended to do. Corrèze and all he stood for represented a regrettable 					past. But the Helena Rubinstein deal represented the future. In 1988, when O-J 					assumed the chief executive’s chair, the company was still a French hair-care 					group; when he stepped down in 2006, it was the biggest cosmetics business in 					the world, and readying itself to expand still further, into India, China, 					Brazil, and Russia. In such a context, recollections of ancient misdeeds receded 					into insignificance. “Not that old story,” the family would sigh wearily 					whenever the old scandals resurfaced. The years, they implied, should have drawn 					the sting from that tale—and this hope, clearly, was shared by Owen-Jones.

				But, on the contrary, the scandals remain relevant 					precisely because L’Oréal has become so large and powerful. The bigger the 					enterprise, after all, the bigger its capacity to bully. Huge multinational 					enterprises, with their enormous budgets and their ability to bestow or remove 					patronage, in the form of jobs or investment, hold more real clout than many 					nation-states. Their acts, therefore, take on a moral and political significance 					over and above the commercial. And L’Oréal is among them—number 346 in Fortune’s list of the world’s 500 largest companies, 					with revenues in 2008 of nearly $26 billion. It is true that L’Oréal does not 					operate in such obviously edgy areas as power generation or banking. But the 					company’s huge advertising outlay gives it immense influence over what we read 					in newspapers and magazines and watch on television. That advertising not only 					molds our sense of what we want to look like and who we want to be—in a very 					real sense, our perception of who we are—but also, as an essential source of 					revenue, enables the company to discourage unwelcome content in the media where 					it buys space.1 Yet at the same time, as the 					Rosenfelder case shows, the company remains—as a commercial and not a political 					entity—politically unaccountable.

				L’Oréal’s founder would have been very much at home 					in this world where business and politics are inseparably twinned. Not that 					Eugène Schueller saw his company as a source of political power in itself. 					Rather it was a guinea pig upon which to test out his theories and a provider of 					funds with which, subsequently, to buy the power to implement them. But in 					practice—and especially in France, where there has long existed a seamless 					interface between commerce and politics—such separations are almost meaningless. 					In Britain, where political power has traditionally been a perquisite of land 					ownership, the time-honored muckraking format is Who Owns 						Britain? with three books of (more or less) that title, by different 					authors, published between 1944 and 2001.1 The 					same is true in America, where wealth has always ruled, and where four Who Owns America? books have been published since 						1936.2 But in France, the equivalent 						books—Les 200 familles, Le 						Retour des 200 familles, Les Nouvelles 200 						familles, Les Bonnes fréquentations—are 					all about social networks. President Pompidou worked at the Rothschild bank and 					had numerous connections in the social and business worlds; Marcel Dassault, the 					aeronautical industrialist, was a member of the Assemblée Nationale; André 					Bettencourt was a senator and a member of successive governments, as well as 					being vice president of one of France’s biggest companies.

				By comparison with these far-reaching tentacles, 					Helena Rubinstein’s concerns seem quaintly parochial. Never interested in 					political power, her extracommercial interests were solely personal and 					familial. And although she and Schueller were of the same generation, and set up 					shop within a few years of each other, this comparatively limited worldview 					meant that by the time of the takeover, his company represented the future, 					hers, the past.

				Although the conjunction of the barber’s hair-dye 					commission and Schueller’s particular talents was undoubtedly fortuitous, it is 					clear that his combination of intellectual ability, obsession, and business 					acumen would have taken him to the top in whatever field he chose. For him, the 					vital factor was education. Once educated, he became unstoppable, able both to 					produce new products at the laboratory bench and to evolve a management 					philosophy that, like its inventor, could succeed in any industry.

				Helena Rubinstein’s success was far narrower, and 					was based almost wholly on her phenomenal talent for trading. Patrick O’Higgins 					once accompanied her on an afternoon’s shopping in Paris. They started by 					visiting the painter Kees van Dongen, where she bought a canvas for $2,000 less 					than the price quoted by the artist, distracting Madame Kees van Dongen (who did 					the selling) at the crucial moment by observing that her skin was dry and 					promising to send her some products. They then continued on to Cartier’s, who 					had developed a new double lipstick container that interested her, and which she 					acquired, after playing the manager like a hooked fish, for 700,000 francs 					($14,000) rather than the official price of 800,000. The painting was sold, 					after her death, for three times what she paid; the lipstick case was “adapted” 					with great success, and as “Nite ’n Day” sold more than a million, at three 					dollars each. Nor was her interest limited to large sums. As a business 					associate observed, “If someone offered Helena Rubinstein a package of gum for a 					nickel she would say ‘too much’ in the hope that it was the only package of gum 					in the world that could be bought for four cents.”3

				Rubinstein’s drive and marketing ability were so 					far above the ordinary that they enabled her to overcome both her lack of 					education and the social and commercial obstacles that confronted all would-be 					businesswomen. But even with all her business talents, she made it big only 					because her face cream hit at a crucial moment in social history.

				Quite how fundamental this was may be seen in the 					very different fate of an equally determined Jewish entrepreneuse who tried to 					open a beauty salon in London’s Bond Street forty years before Helena 					Rubinstein, and whose business, despite its great commercial success, crashed in 					humiliation and bankruptcy.

				Mrs. Rachel Leverson, trading as Madame Rachel 					under the banner “Beautiful For Ever!” opened her salon in 1865. She sold the 					usual range of lotions, creams, powders, and paints, and did well. Within a few 					months of her salon’s opening, she and her many daughters moved from the distant 					suburb of Blackheath to a fine house in Maddox Street, just around the corner 					from her shop, filled it with expensive furniture, and rented a pit-tier box at 					the opera, at £400 a season.

				In the summer of 1868, Madame Rachel was sued for 					fraud and conspiracy by a middle-aged widow, a Mrs. Borradaile. Madame Rachel 					had sold Mrs. Borradaile a number of pricey products—cosmetics, a course of bran 					baths—promising that they would make her beautiful again and would enable her to 					catch a new husband in the person of Lord Ranelagh (whose role in all this 					remained unclear: he was a well-known and notoriously disreputable 					man-about-town). Mrs. Borradaile spent all she had on these treatments, and the 					results were not as promised. So she sued.

				The case against Madame Rachel held little legal 					water. Admittedly, Mrs. Borradaile, stringy, middle-aged, with dyed yellow hair, 					had not become beautiful. Lord Ranelagh had not married her. And the sums 					charged by Madame Rachel—it was rumored £1,000 for the bran baths (around 					£62,000, or over $100,000, in current value)—were large. But nobody had forced 					the plaintiff to buy these products, and Madame Rachel had delivered what she 					had promised: namely, a course of baths. When the jury, after hearing much 					strange and muddled evidence, failed to agree on a verdict, the Times found its failure to acquit “only 					comprehensible on the supposition that they failed to see on which side the 					burden of proof lay.”4 Under English law Madame 					Rachel did not have to prove herself innocent. Mrs. Borradaile had to prove her 					guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, which she had failed to do.

				That should have been that: case dismissed. But the 					prosecution appealed for a retrial, the judge allowed it, and this time the jury 					duly convicted. Madame Rachel, who had been denied bail while waiting for the 					retrial, was sentenced to an unusually harsh five years’ hard labor; and 						the Times, despite its earlier pronouncement, 					applauded. “Whatever may be the differences of opinion about the prisoner’s 					legal guilt, about her moral guilt we take it there can be no doubt whatever,” 					it thundered—thus dismissing, in one sentence, the entire basis of the British 					legal system.

				What was it about Madame Rachel that so rattled the 					British establishment? The prosecution made much of her Jewishness—but it was no 					crime to be Jewish in Victorian England: the prime minister in 1868 was the 					not-very-Protestant Benjamin Disraeli. There were hints of various unsavory 					doings: that the baths were taken in a room fitted up for voyeurs, that Mrs. 					Leverson’s promise to “cleanse the system from many of its impurities” was code 					for performing abortions, whose providers often called themselves “Madame.” But 					none of this hearsay was under scrutiny. That the real problem was the beauty 					salon was made clear by the prosecutor’s declaration that he “wished all the 					ladies who had heard or read this case would learn that if once they crossed the 					threshold of such places they would come out with a taint upon them.”5 That was an extraordinary phrase. Men in 					nineteenth-century Britain clearly found the use of cosmetics highly 					threatening.

				If asked to justify this attitude, the Times editorial writer would doubtless have taken his 					stand, as Victorian gentlemen did, on the Bible, where Saint Paul recommended 					that women should cover their hair—their “crowning glory”—while a man should not 					cover his, because “he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of 						man.”6 In Victorian Britain as in Pauline 					Judea, women were second-class beings, inferior in the sight of God, and as soon 					as they married, the property of their husbands, who alone were entitled to 					enjoy their good looks. And Victorian men, like Saint Paul, further assumed that 					the only reason a woman might want to look good in public—and thus the only 					point of cosmetics—was to seem more attractive to the opposite sex: if 					unmarried, to catch a husband (in the words of a 1770 British law banning it, 					makeup was for “seducing men into matrimony by cosmetic means”); if married, to 					carry on adulterous flirtations.

				This (invariably male) assumption still persists, 					as does the misogyny that informs it. In 2005, Zoo 						Weekly, a British men’s magazine, ran a “Win a boob job for your 					partner” competition, offering all-expenses-paid breast implant surgery as a 					prize to the girl “who deserves it most.” The magazine called for men, or their 					girlfriends, to send in shots of the woman’s cleavage, to be voted on by 					readers. When BBC Radio 1 asked its listeners what they thought about this, some 					women objected that they found the idea of such a competition degrading. But 					this elicited aggressive replies from competition entrants. “Woah! Woah! Woah! 					Too much ‘Girl Power’ in here,” ranted one. “Calm down, girls! I entered the 					competition not because I wanted to give my girlfriend a gift, if she wants 					bigger boobs she can pay for them herself. . . . Its [sic] not always about you girls. High horse 					. . . climb down off of.”

				Victorian England, Pauline Judea, and the readers 					of Zoo could hardly be more different. But they are 					all disturbed by the same idea: that women might choose to be something more 					than a support system for men. For them, the worrying thing about cosmetics is 					the inescapable sense that women do not wear them 					with men in mind, but on the contrary, for their own benefit. Just as on a bad 					hair day nothing will go right, so looking good is always a confidence booster. 					And self-confidence leads to self-assertion.

				This was certainly Helena Rubinstein’s view. One of 					her nieces once asked her what use cosmetics were in meeting people’s real 					needs. Rubinstein replied: “If my products help one young worker feel better 					about herself that day, then I feel I have accomplished something 						worthwhile.”7 And making people feel better 					about themselves still remains the primary function of cosmetics and (more 					recently) cosmetic surgery. In a survey of 1,000 British women conducted in 2005 					by the women’s magazine Grazia, only 13 percent of 					those considering cosmetic surgery said they were doing so because they wanted 					to look more attractive to men, while 64 percent thought it would give them more 						confidence.8 That confidence would of 					course help should they wish to attract a man. But it would also help them 					function without one.

				Powder and paint, when worn by respectable women, 					were thus intolerable to the Victorians on two fronts. First, they bolstered the 					self-esteem of a class of persons supposed to be meek and subordinate; second, 					they represented a highly visible form of rebellion, an incontrovertible and 					unmissable statement that the wearer valued her personal satisfaction above the 					wishes of her husband. One might turn a blind eye to the receipt of a discreet 					parcel of beauty aids, or the digging-out of Grandma’s recipe for rosy cheeks 					(though such activities were always noticed and remarked on: Mrs. X powders, 					Mrs. Y rouges.) But visiting a beauty salon too openly defied social taboos. As 					for running one, that was too much. It had to be stopped, and stopped it 					was.

				Forty years later, however, the daughters of those 					Victorian wives had become lipsticked suffrage marchers who, as everyone knew, 					would sooner rather than later have their way. And Helena Rubinstein, rich, 					independent, self-made, eye-poppingly chic, and sheathed in a seamless shell of 					creams, powders, and paints, both offered an image of what was possible and 					provided the means of getting there—or at least of taking a step along the 					way.

				The problem, however, with products that are of a 					particular moment is that they tend to date. Economically, today’s women have 					never been freer. In that sense we are still living in Rubinstein’s world. But 					cosmetics have moved on dramatically since Madame, in her heyday, was the 					constantly visible face of Helena Rubinstein. It was Eugène Schueller’s 					scientific laboratory, not Helena Rubinstein’s kitchen, that would hold the key 					to the cosmetics future.




II

				During the 					twentieth century, dreams that had for centuries been the stuff of fairy tales 					one after another became reality. Airplanes gave us magic carpets; automobiles, 					seven-league boots. The telephone let us speak across continents; radio and 					television showed us all that was happening in the world, often at the moment it 					happened. Most recently, the Internet has granted us instant, universal 					knowledge. And although immortality is still beyond us, the beauty business 					offers a consolation prize. What (Freud famously inquired) do women want? Madame 					Rachel could have told him: to be beautiful forever. And today, beautiful 					forever is, up to a point, ours. When, in 1935, a reader wrote to the author of 						Skin Deep inquiring about Helena Rubinstein’s 					“Herbal Tissue” cream, retailing at $1.25 and supposed to “prevent or heal 					lines, crepy eyelids and crows around the eyes,”9 the answer was: “There is, alas, no cosmetic known capable of 					doing the things described.” Today, however, that is no longer true.

				Skin creams are still most people’s first line of 					defense. And these days, they can have some slight 					effect. In April 2007, research carried out for the BBC television program Horizon, investigating the antiaging industry, found 					that although most creams left wrinkles wholly unsmoothed, one did, over time, 					make a slight, but measurable, difference: No. 7 Protect and Perfect Serum, a 					proprietary brand of the British pharmacy chain Boots, and at £16.75 ($27) for a 					30ml jar, one of the cheapest products in the survey. Within twenty-four hours 					of the program being broadcast, sales jumped 2,000 percent. Customers queued 					outside branches of Boots at five the next morning. In Yorkshire, there was a 					near-riot when one woman bought a store’s entire stock. Within two weeks what 					had been a year’s supply of the lotion was bought up, and single jars sold on 					eBay for up to £100. Today, in time-honored style, the Protect and Perfect 					family has expanded to include day cream, night cream, beauty serum, intense 					beauty serum, and a range of products for men. Why stop at one product when 					twelve will do?

				The secret of Boots’ cream is a vitamin A compound 					called retinol, which increases the production of two important components of 					the skin, glycosaminoglycan and procollagen. Creams today also use hyaluronic 					acid, or hyaluronan, a component of connective tissue that cushions and 					lubricates, and their advertising heavily emphasizes scientific certainty. Thus, 					L’Oréal’s Youth Code skin cream is “Inspired by the Science of Genes.” But the 					scientifically active ingredients in such creams, although present, are a 					vanishingly small proportion of the whole—far less than the quantity required to 					produce any noticeable effect. As Liz Walker, proprietor of the House of Beauty 					in Barnsley, Yorkshire, put it, “A pampering facial or a nice cream is all very 					well, but it’s not going to make those wrinkles completely disappear, is 						it?”10

				If the cream doesn’t do the trick, however, new and 					effective resources are now available. We can either go deeper, with plastic 					surgery, or iron out wrinkles with “cosmoceuticals.” In 2006, the number of 					cosmetic procedures, both surgical and noninvasive, was estimated at well over 					21 million worldwide. By 2015, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons expects 					its members to carry out 55 million such procedures annually in the United 					States alone.11 The market, valued at nearly 					$14 billion in 2007, is growing at $1 billion a year.12 On-demand shape-shifting has become one of the passions of the 					new millennium.

				Plastic surgery is not new. As long ago as 2000 						B.C., doctors in India repaired noses 					disfigured by disease or punishment. But until antiseptics and anesthesia made 					operations relatively painless and safe, it was used only in extreme cases. 					Toward the end of the nineteenth century, it gained ground: plastic surgery was 					one of the treatments Helena Rubinstein investigated on her whirlwind tour of 					European skin specialists in 1905, along with chemical skin peels and other such 					scientific innovations. But these treatments were expensive and often risky. In 					1921, the American heiress Gladys Deacon, whom the press dubbed the world’s 					loveliest woman, and who was certainly one of the richest, had paraffin wax 					injected into her face to correct a small indentation at the bridge of her nose. 					She hoped to achieve the profile of a Greek statue, but unfortunately for her 					the wax slipped, leaving her with an incipient horn on her forehead and a 					swollen neck where the wax had run down under the skin. It was a catastrophe 					from which neither she nor paraffin-wax treatments ever recovered.

				As so often, military requirements nudged the 					science forward. Wars destroy many faces, and doctors such as Jacques Joseph in 					Germany during World War I and Archibald McIndoe in Britain during World War II 					were both made famous by their pioneering techniques in reconstructive surgery. 					Inevitably, these were soon co-opted by the beauty business. After World War I, 					another pioneering plastic surgeon, Sir Harold Gillies, wondered if it might be 					possible to make a living out of private plastic surgery. The answer, as he soon 					found, was yes. He neatly summed up the difference between his new field and his 					old: “Reconstructive surgery is an attempt to return to normal; cosmetic 					surgery is an attempt to surpass the normal.”13 					But while comparatively few people, at least in peacetime, need reconstructive 					surgery, almost everybody would like to look better than they do, and many are 					happy to pay for the privilege.

				Today, surpassing the normal has become so 					run-of-the-mill that to age unretouched seems almost a form of obstinacy. The 					website of one London cosmetic-surgery practice offers a body map: click on the 					appropriate part to choose your preferred procedure. Face, ears, arms, hands, 					breasts, abdomen, genitalia, hips, legs, skin—all can be altered, and, 					hopefully, improved. You can indulge in medical tourism: see Prague (or Warsaw, 					or Rio) and get your tummy tucked while you’re there. The New York Times even published a restaurant-type guide to Rio 					doctors, giving prices, specialties, booking advice, and handy hints: “Dr. 					Müller is known for, among other things, sculpturing beautifully shaped breasts 					and performing body liposuction. If you’re looking for an aggressive makeover 					this is not the place for you: Dr. Müller specializes in the natural look. 						. . .”14 Doctors tout themselves 					online, publishing testimonials from grateful patients and employing media 					consultants to promote their public image—not only in America, where this kind 					of thing has always been allowed, but in Britain, where it very much has not. An 					old-school plastic and cosmetic surgeon I spoke to—he didn’t want to be named, 					I’ll call him Peter—thought advertising for cosmetic surgery “the pits: you used 					to get struck off by the General Medical Council for that kind of thing.” 					However, even where there is a prohibition, doctors get around it: all they need 					do is belong to a clinic, which does the advertising for them.

				So fundamental, indeed, has body altering become to 					our lives, and so fascinating are the possibilities, that watching it in action 					has become a component of prime-time television. In programs such as Extreme Makeover, Nip/Tuck, and Ten Years Younger, unreconstructed subjects undergo transformation 					by a team of experts—the dentist, the hairdresser, the boob man, the nose man, 					the stylist-cum-cheerleader—into another person altogether. The original 					subject—the clay, so to speak—exists only as raw material: the Before. The 					wizards do their stuff, and—shazam!—a new woman or man is born, all their own 					work. Pygmalion and Frankenstein live!

				I asked Peter if he felt like a sculptor when 					remolding people’s faces and bodies. He said he did. A lot of his colleagues, he 					said, are (as he is) painters or sculptors in their spare time—that was often 					what first attracted them to this branch of surgery. Indeed, he feels artistic 					skills so necessary to plastic surgeons that he set up a course called 					“Sculpture for Surgeons.” In it, seven or eight plastic surgeons are given a 					ball of clay and told to model the head of a sitter—something they do not, at 					first, find easy even though, or perhaps because, they are so familiar with 					facial anatomy. One typical participant produced, in the words of Luke Shepherd, 					the sculptor who teaches the course, “what turned out to be an anatomical model, 					very hollow-looking, more like a skull. He said he didn’t know how to fill in 					the soft tissue around the bone structure.” That is, the shape of the end of the 					nose, or the eyelids—the details, in fact, that concern potential patients. “We 					try to give them a basic grounding in the language of form—what symmetry is, how 					the eye balances things,” Shepherd said. “It’s training the eye to ask questions 					of the form so when they come to surgery the eye is able to make those sort of 					decisions.” He aims to teach the surgeons on his course to “see 3-D.” It is also 					important that they see each patient as an individual problem. Plastic surgeons 					get known for a particular specialty, but with facial work this specialization 					can be dangerous: patients don’t want a “signature” job, they want the nose, or 					chin, they themselves feel they need.

				Plastic surgery is still not cheap. But easy terms 					are available, and the customers are happy to pay up. Fifty-four percent of the 					interviewees in the Grazia survey intended to have 					cosmetic surgery, expecting to spend on average $5,650 (£3,500). If they didn’t 					have the necessary money available, they were happy to spend less on clothes and 					going out. If necessary they would take out a loan—many practices offer 					low-interest financing to their customers. And the market is not confined to 					women: a 2007 survey by the market-reseach organization YouGov found that a 					quarter of all men in the United Kingdom. would consider cosmetic 					intervention.

				However, the great majority of cosmetic procedures 					these days do not involve surgery. On the contrary, the American Society of 					Plastic Surgeons predicts that 88 percent of the 55 million procedures 					anticipated in 2015 will be noninvasive. “You can do a lot of things with a 					needle now—you can compete with a knife,” said Dr. Lucy Glancey, a specialist in 					cosmetic and antiaging treatments.15 You can 					either plump out your face with collagen fillers, “redistributing volume,” as 					Dr. Glancey put it, so that firmness returns without the deadly “windswept” look 					that can result from a face-lift; or you can simply smooth those wrinkles away 					with Botox, the registered name for an injectable solution of the botulinum 					toxin, which blocks the signals telling your muscles to contract. If you eat 					meat containing this poison, it attacks the muscles in your chest: you can’t 					breathe and it kills you. But if a small amount is injected into your face, the 					facial muscles can’t move—and so, can’t wrinkle.

				First used medicinally in the 1970s to relieve 					uncontrollable muscle spasms, Botox’s possible cosmetic application was first 					recognized in 1987. Since then, its popularity has increased exponentially. In 					2000, about 800,000 Americans had Botox injections, while nearly 2 million had 					cosmetic surgery; in 2008, 5.5 million chose Botox (one in eleven of whom were 					men), and 1.7 million surgery. L’Oréal, already part of the injectables market 					through its part ownership of the pharmaceuticals firm Sanofi-Aventis and its 					share of Galderma, a joint venture with Nestlé, in 2009 introduced its own 					botulinum toxin treatment, to be marketed under the name Azzalure in Europe, and 					Reloxin in the States. The market for these treatments, worth $1.2 billion in 					2009, is expected to grow by 13 percent per year between 2009 and 2012—a 					tempting prospect, especially given that both 2008 and 2009 saw L’Oréal’s 					profits fall: in 2008 by 27 percent, in 2009 by a further 3.2 percent.

				Injections of Botox (as the treatment has become 					generically known, though in fact the name is a proprietary trademark owned by 					Allergan) are quick and virtually painless. The effects are almost instantaneous 					and involve no ugly scarring. And if you don’t like the result, no problem: it 					wears off. Since it works because of its paralyzing effect, it makes your face 					less mobile, producing a curious masklike look. But some users actively prefer 					this. Just as in eighteenth-century France, the cosmetic mask represents 					something so desirable—membership in the king’s set, the defeat of time—that its 					very artificiality becomes a mark of status. “As the Botox wears off towards the 					end of three months, the movement returns to my face and I get really impatient 					for my next fix,” said Jay Nicholls, a thirty-two-year-old model and 						dancer.16 Jay has her Botox renewed every 					three months at £500 (about $700) a time. That’s the financial equivalent of a 					face-lift every two years, on and on, into the foreseeable future.

				Fillers are more dubious—or that, at any rate, is 					Peter’s view. In fact, he thought they could sometimes be quite dangerous. 					Gladys Deacon–type disasters are by no means inconceivable even now. The “trout 					pout” that can result from having your lips plumped is a notorious risk. But, as 					with Botox, these treatments are not permanent, and since they are both cheaper, 					per treatment, than surgery, as well as far less time-consuming and daunting, 					more and more people want to try them. “Supermarket workers, dinner ladies, 					they’re all saving up for [Botox],” says Liz Walker. “And there are no holds 					barred as to how far they’ll go for all the other stuff, either. We’re now using 					machines they don’t even use in London in order to get more immediate 					results.”

				I asked Dr. Glancey if she had tried out her own 					treatments. She admitted that she had: several of them, in fact. “We’re in a 					sweetie shop here—you can’t resist,” she said. And it’s easy to see what she 					means. Once you take the first step—iron out your frown lines, whiten your 					teeth, plump out your cheeks or the backs of your hands—your body becomes a 					blank sheet. What about those crow’s-feet, those baggy upper arms 					. . . ? If something goes wrong, perhaps some further tweaking may 					improve it. Once you begin, the possibilities for discontent are infinite, 					perfection always somewhere around the next corner. And soon, in the excitement 					of redesign, you’ve forgotten what you looked like in the first place. 					Before-and-after photographs of surgery addicts show a terrifying disjunction 					between the presurgery face and the end result of serial adjustments. “Most 					surgeons have to convince people to have less,” said Luke Shepherd.

				For some, the procedure rather than the result is 					the important thing. In an extreme form, this pattern can be pathological: the 					feeling of constant discontent with one’s body, and compulsion to change it, is 					a syndrome known as body dysmorphic disorder. But even for nondysmorphics, 					cosmetic procedures can be addictive. “I’m here for a wound check to make sure 					I’m healing properly,” Lauren, forty-five, said as she waited for her 					appointment at a large London practice.

				I had a tummy tuck, had my implants changed 					and I had a breast uplift. I had my first breast implants done 17 years ago 					after I had my son. My boobs went from a C to an A and I thought, “I don’t like 					that, they look like pita breads.” I was considering having a tummy tuck so I 					thought while I’m there I might as well have my breasts done.17

				Mostly, though, the treatments are a means to an 					end: feeling better about yourself. “I have completely re-invented myself and 					Botox has played a big part in that,” said Lisa, thirty-seven, while Victoria, a 					widow, age forty-five, said Botox “has given me the confidence to restart my 					life after [my husband’s] death.”18

				Workplace issues are also important. Particularly 					when times are hard, people feel that if they begin to look old they may lose 					their job to someone younger. When the beauty business began, this fear was not 					a woman’s concern, as men were the principal wage earners and most women’s chief 					preoccupation was to catch a husband—as in a typical L’Oréal ad from 1923, which 					showed a pretty girl sitting between two admirers: “The young are life’s 					favorites. . . . Gray hairs don’t attract admiring looks. 					And happy youth lasts longer for those who use L’Oréal.”

				But priorities soon changed—and the letters written 					by readers to the author of Skin Deep in 1935 and 					1936, during the Depression, pinpoint the moment. These women’s principal worry 					was no longer that they would fail to catch a man, but that they might lose 					their job. Their earnings, formerly, like their bright-red lipstick, a badge of 					newly gained freedom and independence, had become a vital part of the family 					budget; and cosmetics and hair dye (once carefree banners for emancipation) were 					now essential tools in the grim fight for employment. In those circumstances, 					cosmetics played a vital role—whether by preserving the illusion of youth, so 					that an employer would be less inclined to “let you go,” or because the wearer 					felt—and so worked—better. Skin Deep’s researches 					revealed that all the synthetic hair dyes on the market in America during the 					1930s were more or less allergenic, some seriously so; but the ensuing 					correspondence made it clear that many women felt they had to risk them, or else 					face unemployment. “Due to the fact that my hair is prematurely grey, and even 					more important, that if such a fact were known it would jeopardize my job, I 					have in desperation and with much fear and trembling been using Inecto Hair 					Dye,” confessed a worried reader in 1935. Inecto had been found to cause acute 					dermatitis of the face, inflammation and irritation of the scalp, face, and 					nose, dermatitis of the scalp, sores on scalp and face, swelling of the eyelids 					and closing of the eyes, and “many other unpleasant consequences, including 					toxic absorption extending down over the face, back and arms, followed by acute 					nephritis, Bright’s disease and anaemia.”19 					Another wanted to know “if there is certain proof of injury to persons who have 					used Grayban for a long period. My work makes it important that I look as well 					as possible, and gray hair is not flattering to me, as many try to make me 						fancy.”20 Grayban was based on a salt of 					bismuth, and poisonous when absorbed. But many users would tolerate any 					discomfort to avoid being sacked.

				Similar fears resurfaced in the economic crisis 					year of 2008. As always in a time of recession, the beauty business boomed. In 					America, a total of 12.1 million cosmetic procedures took place—despite the 					recession, a 3-percent increase over the preceding year. People were, however, 					less inclined to go for pure “bling”: Dr. Richard Baxter, a plastic surgeon in 					Washington State, noticed a marked decrease in the size of breast implants as 					the economy started to go downhill. Before the recession, fewer than a third of 					his clients chose a B cup implant; after, about half picked a B. “People have 					turned to more natural-looking things,” he said.21 But men as well as women now turned to the beauty industry in 					hopes that it might make them seem more desirable to employers. In 2008’s first 					quarter, one big U.K. cosmetic group reported a 17-percent rise in male 					face-lifts, while over 5,200 men consulted for other youth-enhancing 						procedures.22 In the last three months of 					that same year, a time when thousands of workers in financial institutions lost 					their jobs, there was a 10-percent rise in face-lifts for men countrywide as 					sacked bankers used their severance packages to buy plastic surgery.23 “There was this notion in the City [of London] 					where the older partners felt threatened by the younger partners,” said Dr. 					Glancey (who also saw a marked increase in the number of men coming to her for 					treatment). “They didn’t want to look too tired. That tells everyone you’re not 					going to be as good as a young person. If your face doesn’t give that message 					then perhaps they’ll forget how old you really are.”

				Naturally this becomes even edgier if everyone else 					in the office has had the signs of advancing years removed. It’s a classic 					example of positive feedback: once your competitors have had “work done,” the 					notion of what’s acceptable changes, and you’re obliged to go down the same 					route merely in order to stay in the game.

				For as youth increasingly becomes a necessary 					qualification for success, aging, even for the happily partnered and employed, 					has become frightening and unacceptable. “I’m not alone in thinking the idea of 					being 50 is an absolute outrage,” confessed journalist Christa D’Souza. “If you 					were to look at [my] photograph and tell me you see an attractive middle-aged 					woman (for that technically is what I am at 46) I’d not be merely insulted, I’d 					feel, on some level, that I had failed.”24 But 					at what? At holding back age itself? Does looking younger make people feel 					younger? It is true that as longevity increases, forty will genuinely become, as 					we’re constantly told, the new thirty. In 2000, the average German was 39.9 					years old and could expect to live another 39.2 years; middle age could 					therefore be said to occur at age 40. But by 2050, the average German will be 					51.9 years old and will live, on average, another 37.1 years, pushing middle age 					back five years.25

				Face-lifts, then, may help reconcile people not 					only to the inevitability of getting older, but of being old longer. Writer 					Linda Brown said that when she first had her face-lift she felt her face no 					longer really belonged to her—it was simply “the face.” “I wanted me back,” she 					said. “I couldn’t reconcile myself to the woman in the mirror—I just couldn’t 					relate to this woman at all.” That is easy to imagine, for we have all met that 					woman, and she is oddly unnerving: neither old nor young but rather, 					indefinably, outside age. Hers is the face of cosmetic surgery, the face of our 					times. And however familiar on others, to meet it in the mirror must inevitably 					be an odd experience. As the weeks passed, though, Brown got accustomed to it. 					“I now look like ‘me.’ I don’t care about the red marks, I think for the first 					time in my life I don’t have to compensate.”26

				I can personally attest to the irresistible allure 					of cosmetic surgery. I was brought up to assume that one made the best of what 					one had been given: in my case, large breasts. I’ve always hated them, but the 					thought of doing anything about them (other than wearing a good bra) never 					seriously crossed my mind. Perhaps that was stupid: Peter the surgeon thinks 					breast operations almost always leave the woman much happier than before. But my 					bikini-wearing days are over, nor do I any longer lust after strapless or 					spaghetti-strap dresses. It seemed inconceivable I would ever consider such an 					operation now.

				In a spirit of inquiry, however, and for the 					purposes of this book, I arranged a consultation with one of the 					cosmetic-surgery practices whose ads, plastered throughout the London transport 					system, encourage travelers to “Shape up for summer!” Adorned with photos of 					improbably self-supporting cleavage, the advertisers imply that buying new 					breasts is no more problematic or significant (though a little more expensive) 					than buying a new swimsuit. The ad gave a phone number and urged tube-riders to 					call for a free consultation. So I did.

				The practice was located in London’s Harley Street, 					the traditional address of Britain’s grander doctors, and one of the planet’s 					most expensive parcels of real estate. A quick trawl through the Internet 					revealed at least thirty-two different plastic-surgery clinics and practitioners 					located there, and even more in the surrounding streets. Presumably Harley 					Street’s aura of oak-aged respectability offers a counterweight to cosmetic 					surgery’s still somewhat tacky image, compounded of dubious outcomes, tasteless 					advertising (one such ad, urging customers to “Make Yourself Amazing,” offers 					£750 off breast augmentations if they take a late booking and fill a vacant 					slot), medical tourism, and easy finance.

				The group with which I had my appointment started 					out twenty years ago with one clinic. Now it has sixteen nationwide. In the 					waiting area, which takes up the entire ground floor, every seat was occupied, 					with a six-deep queue at reception. Most of the patients were women, though 					there were a couple of young men. (In fact, I was told, 40 percent of this 					group’s clientele is now male.) Many of those waiting were clearly habitués, in 					for a quick touch-up: “Vicky, you know your way downstairs—thank you, honey,” 					the receptionist trilled. I had never met her, and was there to discuss what is 					in fact quite a serious operation, but I, too, was unhesitatingly greeted by my 					first name: “Hallo, Ruth.”

				When I got to see the nurse I was quite open about 					my reason for being there, and assured her there was little chance I would 					actually have the operation. But we agreed that she would nonetheless take me 					through the consultation as though I were one of her more usual customers—who 					generally, once they’ve saved up the money, can’t wait to get it done. The 					booklet she gave me to take away urged patients to “take a period of 7–14 days 					to consider,” which must mean that many don’t. We began with pictures—befores 					and afters—and then the nurse explained what the procedures would be, and the 					costs. With one night in hospital, a breast reduction would cost me £5,720 					($9,180), with two nights, £5,990 ($9,600), plus another £300 ($480) for a 					subsequent necessary injection. That is serious money, for which I have other 					uses. But as we went on, and against all expectation, I found myself wondering 					whether, perhaps, I mightn’t have the operation after all. Was it too late, even 					now, to release my inner Venus de Milo? If I’d still been in the spaghetti-strap 					market, I’d almost certainly have done it.

				Vanity, vanity. But research shows that this desire 					to attain something nearer one’s ideal physical self is more than that. Our 					preference for attractive people over plain ones is hardwired. When newborn 					infants as young as one day old are shown pairs of photographed faces, one 					judged attractive by adult subjects, one judged plain by the same subjects, the 					babies spend more time looking at the attractive face.27 Such innate preferences must affect how others judge us, yet 					until now we have never been able permanently to alter our less attractive 					physical characteristics.

				Which would seem to imply that the real gift is 					agency: the fact that we are now able to take the necessary action. A 1995 study 					of cosmetic surgery included one woman whose breast augmentation went 					disastrously wrong, leading to multiple correctional operations and scarring. 					But she was still pleased she had had the procedure done. Before it she had seen 					life as a downward spiral over which she had no control; after, she felt 					determined to keep going.28 Next time, it would 					turn out better. In our age of infinite choice, a new and better possibility is 					always available, in bodies as in everything else. And there can always be a 					next time. And another. And another. . .




III

				But if new 					bodies, and new faces, are available off the rack, how will we choose which to 					select? Who sets the fashionable ideal?

				The answer is: some enviable, powerful other. The 					look of the eighteenth-century French court, for example, was not only clownish 					but dangerous. Everyone knew that the skin-whitening paste called ceruse, made 					from lead, was a deadly poison that ruined the skin it covered and could cause 					death. But the king painted his face in this way; and rather than risk losing 					their social position by appearing outlandishly unpainted, members of the court 					made themselves up to match.

				More recently the choice has often been a matter of 					race. Sometimes, as with those who sought urgent nose jobs in Nazi Germany, 					“passing” can be a matter of life and death. More often people simply want to 					look like the majority, because that majority holds the social and economic 					power. “Trying to succeed in a white world is very, very difficult,” said Sami, 					a young Malaysian man living in Britain. “It’s hard enough if you’re white—but 					even harder if you’re black.” Sami was about to spend 40,000 euros on a 					leg-lengthening operation because he felt his present height—5’2”, nothing 					unusual in Malaysia, where the average male height is 5’4”—made it impossible to 					be taken seriously in a society where the average man is 5’9” tall. And from 					mere practicality—aping the looks of the powerful because that will make life 					easier—it is a short step to finding those looks aesthetically preferable.

				It is thus not surprising, though still depressing, 					that America’s first black self-made millionaire, Sarah Breedlove, aka Madam C. 					J. Walker, made her money by developing hair-straightening products such as the 					hot comb. “Hair pressing was a ritual of black women’s culture of intimacy,” 					wrote the black author and historian bell hooks. “It was a world where the 					images constructed as barriers between one’s self and the world were briefly let 					go. . . . I was overjoyed when mama finally agreed I could join the 					Saturday ritual.” Later, hooks abandoned straightened hair, wearing her 					“natural” as a political declaration. But “For years I still considered it a 					problem. . . . It has been only in recent years that I have ceased to 					worry about what other people would say about my hair.”29 Similarly, flat-chested Asian girls living in Caucasian societies 					seek breast enlargements to conform to the white notion of what is beautiful, 					while big-bosomed black women seek reductions for the same reason.

				Recently, L’Oréal has used two nonwhite women as 					its “face”: singer Beyoncé Knowles and Freida Pinto, who starred in the film 						Slumdog Millionaire. In both cases, however, the 					pictures used in the ads showed them paler than in real life. When a storm of 					protest was raised by the sudden lightening of Beyoncé, L’Oréal said it was 					“categorically untrue that L’Oréal Paris altered Ms. Knowles’s features or skin 					tone in the campaign.” But the fact remained: the image they used was lighter 					than any other photo of Beyoncé. If L’Oréal Paris had not done the alteration, 					someone most certainly had. Presumably it was thought the main customer-base was 					not yet ready to emulate anyone more than slightly coffee-colored.2

				Above and beyond the thorny issue of race, however, 					the lightening of Beyoncé raises interesting questions. They concern the 					relations between photography and the beauty industry; for not only do the age 					of mass cosmetics and the age of universal photography coincide, they are 					inextricably intertwined. Powerful new technologies inevitably affect our 					perceptions. The arrival of the gramophone changed the way we listened to music. 					And in the same way, the arrival of photography revolutionized the way we 					visualized ourselves. For the first time in history, we could obtain, at any 					moment, a record of ourselves as others saw us—and use that image to experiment 					with ways of improving what they saw. From then on, the camera dictated the way 					we wanted to look. And despite the camera’s deceptive instantaneity, that look 					was always far from nature.

				Photography has always been an art as much as a 					recording device. Because the earliest photographic films were more sensitive to 					blues than reds, and so didn’t properly register flesh-tones, the detail of 					early portraits had to be manually adjusted after the event. And when both films 					and cameras became more efficient, a new problem arose. The super-sharp images 					were wonderful for landscapes and buildings, and also for portraits when the 					intention was documentary, as in pictures of relentlessly weathered Native 					American braves or aging, bewhiskered prime ministers. But a pitiless record of 					every pore was not what a lady required. Often, therefore, photographers 					inserted a kindly blurring, softening the focus until blemishes were obscured in 					a gentle fuzz. After the small photographs known as cartes-de-visite became de rigueur in the 1860s, every woman 					visualized herself as she might be when posed in soft focus against a studio 					background.

				It was this photo-face, painstakingly smoothed and 					prepared, that Helena Rubinstein presented to her customers, both in her 					advertisements and in all the other extensive publicity she engineered. Madame, 					as she appeared in those photos, was everything implied by the word soignée, her hair glossily in place, her skin matte, 					white, and flawless, her lips a perfectly outlined scarlet jewel, her face—even 					in her sixties and seventies—preternaturally devoid of wrinkles. Often pictured 					in her lab coat, she looked calm, dignified, smooth, youthful, elegant, an image 					of perfection that was far from the chaotic and substantial reality. “I had to 					airbrush inches from her waist!” moaned photographer 					Cecil Beaton after snapping the distinctly rotund Madame of the 1930s; and 					snapshots taken at less guarded moments show how much of this ideal look was 					achieved by a combination of skillful makeup and photographer’s artifice. But 					the alteration had a significance over and above vanity. It was the photographs, 					not the unretouched reality, that defined the look women wanted to emulate; and 					the cosmetics those photographs sold gave them the means to do so.

				Other cosmetics companies of course used their own 					endorsers, chosen from among society’s enviable strata—which at first meant 					socialites. During the 1920s, Pond’s Cold Cream divided these ladies into two 					classes—$1,000 people and $500 people—approaching them for endorsements around 					the twentieth of the month, when their allowances were getting depleted. They 					also recruited some genuine aristocrats from Europe—the Duchesse de Richelieu, 					Lady Mountbatten, and Queen Marie of Romania “a bargain [who] endorsed for 					$2,000, two silver boxes, and a miniature of herself by de Laszlo.”30 There, under a misty photograph, nestled the 					illustrious name; but you would have been hard put to identify its original if 					you passed her in the street.

				Soon, however, these blurry socialites were 					supplanted by a new, specifically photographic aristocracy: film stars. 					Traditionally, actresses had been classed with courtesans, and had ranked 					similarly low in society. But photography—and, a little later, and definitively, 					cinematography—transformed them into goddesses, their images known and 					worshipped across the world. Constance Talmadge, one of the great stars of the 					silent screen, was said to have posed for 400 testimonial photographs in one 					day, “showing a set of white teeth due to the exclusive use of Pepsodent, 					Iodent, Kolynos, Dentyne, Ipoma, Squibbs, Lyon’s, Colgate’s or Pebeco.”31 Between takes, maids would help change her 					outfit, and stagehands would rearrange the settings.

				These endorsement photographs were quite obviously 					posed. But soon a different class of pictures entered the public’s photographic 					consciousness: the off-duty “snapshots” that became such an important part of 					Hollywood publicity. These photographs, the public was given to understand, 					represented the movie gods and goddesses in their casual, offscreen moments. The 					truth, of course, was that nothing could have been less casual: those perfectly 					clear complexions with their carefully graded highlights, those huge, mascaraed 					eyes, those big scarlet lips, that hair glowing with improbable brilliance and 					color, were the result of careful makeup, endless posing, skillful lighting, 					and, usually, extensive retouching.

				And it was this denatured photographic 					“naturalness” that women tried to reproduce through cosmetics. You ladled on the 					foundation and powder, the eye shadow, mascara, and lipstick, and left the house 					camera-ready. Even in the most dimly day-lit offices and high streets, people 					felt undressed if they weren’t wearing long black lashes, blue-shadowed eyes, 					bright red lips, and pancake foundation, as though imminently about to face the 					klieg lights. Traveling in the New York subway one day, I was struck by the 					unusually beautiful complexion of the young woman opposite—only to be confounded 					a few seconds later as she opened her bag, took out a makeup kit, and proceeded 					to cover her face with pink gloop. When she’d finished she looked just like 					everyone else, which, presumably, was the intention. Office life required this 					bland, smoothed-over, highly colored look. Even some men in the public eye—think 					Tony Blair, John Edwards—now feel undressed without the layer of artificial tan 					to which constant studio exposure has accustomed them—and us.

				So people’s notion of what constituted a “normal” 					appearance was rejigged to fit the movies. But the conspiracy was, on the whole, 					benign. Not only were the cosmetics companies happy, so was the woman in the 					street. At least the effect she sought was achievable. The Helena Rubinstein of 					the advertisements might be an artifact, but she was a self-created artifact. 					Artur Rubinstein the pianist, her friend, compatriot, and neighbor in New York 					(though no relation), would watch from his Park Avenue window, directly opposite 					her makeup room, as Madame, then well into her seventies, painstakingly 					constructed the face she wished to present to the world—a ritual he found 					touching, impressive, and, as a public performer himself, understandable.32 And the final result, though heavily worked, 					nevertheless remained rooted in actual appearance. With time and expertise you, 					too, could construct a comparably perfect surface: a carapace that (if you 					followed wartime Vogue’s instructions, applying the 					color, blotting, powdering, reapplying, reblotting, repowdering . . .) 					would carry you through the day without cracking. The products were within most 					people’s easy financial reach, and the effort was free.

				Today, 					all is different. The fashion pages and celebrity magazines no longer represent 					living women and men but a sort of meta-world. In the film The September Issue, about Vogue 					magazine, there is a wonderfully self-referential scene where the 					cameraman is persuaded to become part of the fashion shoot he is filming. He is 					of normal shape—that is to say, his stomach is not perfectly flat. When Anna 					Wintour, the editor, views the resulting pictures, her immediate reaction is to 					call the Photoshop studio to have the offending inches shaved down. They are an 					intrusion: they have no place in the world Vogue 					sets out to create. In Vogue-world, as in the 					world of “procedures,” reality is merely a starting point. Just when the 					universal takeup of cosmetic surgery, Botox, and the rest began to shift the 					boundaries of what could be achieved in recasting the body, Photoshop began to 					revolutionize the photographic image. Ever since, the two have been twinned.

				The acknowledged master of Photoshop is Pascal 					Dangin, a Frenchman living in New York. He works for (among others) Vogue, Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar, 						Allure, French Vogue, Italian Vogue, V, the New York Times Magazine. Many photographers, including 					Annie Leibovitz and Steven Meisel, “rarely work with anyone else.” For 					Leibovitz, he is a sort of validator of her craft. “Just by the fact that he 					works with you, you think you’re good. If he works with you a lot, maybe you 					think, Well, maybe I’m worthwhile.”33

				Lauren Collins of The 					New Yorker spent several months shadowing Dangin for 					a profile, “Pixel Perfect.” Here she describes him at work on some pictures of 					an actress:

				“She looks too small 						because she’s teeny,” he said. On a drop-down menu, he selected a warping 						tool, a device that augments the volume of clusters of pixels. The dress 						puffed up pleasingly, as if it had been fluffed by some helpful 						lady-in-waiting inside the screen.

				Next, Dangin moved the 						mouse so the pointer hovered near the actress’s neck. “I softened the 						collarbones, but then she started to get too retouched, so I put back some 						stuff,” he explained. He pressed a button and her neck got a little bonier. 						He clicked more drop-down menus—master opacity stamp, clone stamp. [This] 						minimized the actress’s temples, which bulged a little, tightened the skin 						around her chin, and excised a fleshy bump from her forehead. She had an 						endearingly crooked bottom row of teeth, which Dangin knew better than to 						fix. . . .

				Another time, Dangin 						showed me how he had restructured the chest . . . of an actress 						who, to his eye, seemed to have had a clumsy breast enhancement. Like a 						double negative, virtual plastic surgery cancelled out real plastic surgery, 						resulting in a believable look.34

				Even the recent Dove campaign, which uses larger 					women to model underwear in an attempt to counteract the relentlessly skinny 					ideal promoted by the fashion industry, was Danginized. “Do you know how much 					retouching was on that?” Dangin said. “But it was great to do, a challenge, to 					keep everyone’s skin and faces showing the mileage but not looking 						unattractive.”35

				Routine retouching of this kind has created an 					ever-greater distance between what the beauty business tells us we ought to look 					like and what is achievable. The pictures of the possible and desirable that we 					carry inside our head are no longer based upon images of actual bodies. Jay 					Nicholls, the dancer who so loves her Botox, is thinking of using it to prevent 					underarm sweating. Not because sweating presents a particular problem: “I 					already use a roll-on solution that stops me sweating for two weeks.” But she 					“would love to be able to stop it for longer.”36 What’s sweating, after all? A mere bodily function. And who, 					these days, has any patience for those? Inside and out, we prefer the virtual 					ideal.

				Of course people are aware of this disjunction. And 					the nervousness it arouses is reflected in their fury when the image of some 					well-known icon appears so heavily reconstructed that it is no longer possible 					to pretend these images reflect reality. With L’Oréal’s Beyoncé and Pinto 					pictures, many of the protests were prompted by the perceived racism of the 					alterations. But race played no part in the controversy surrounding the heavily 					doctored images of actress Kate Winslet published by Vanity 						Fair in November 2008. “Those of us who are not legally blind will 					instantly realize that the woman on the cover looks nothing like the real Kate Winslet. Is the woman an imposter? An 					evil twin? Or just the result of hundreds of man hours of digital retouching? 					I’m going with ‘alien,’ ” typically announced one blog.37

				A video has recently been doing the rounds of 					YouTube. Marked “Every Teenage Girl Should See This,” it shows a transformation 					scene: a normally pleasant-looking young woman Photoshopped before your eyes, 					her neck lengthened, her face thinned, her eyebrows raised, her complexion 					clarified: duckling to swan. Photographically, she becomes the beauty no 					“procedures”—and certainly no makeup—will ever make her in real life. How the 					girl in question feels, faced with so clear and unattainable an image of what 					she might look like if she only looked different, we are not told.

				Unsurprisingly, the now habitual digital 					enhancement of fashion and glamour images has given rise to a good deal of 					agonizing. The British Liberal Democrat Party is so perturbed by its pernicious 					influence on young girls’ self-esteem that it has proposed a new law. Just as 					cigarette manufacturers must print a warning on every packet announcing that 					tobacco is lethal, so they want every photographic image to be accompanied by a 					message saying whether or not it has been doctored.38

				Our great-great-grandmothers encased their bodies 					in whalebone in pursuit of the eighteen-inch waist; our mothers covered their 					faces with paste and powder so that they might look like their favorite film 					stars. And today’s women turn to the knife and the needle, liposucking off some 					inches here, tightening a jawline there, plumping out this fallen cheek, lifting 					that recalcitrant breast, in a never-ending, inevitably futile attempt to 					achieve the ultimate unreality: Photoshop.




IV

				When Helena 					Rubinstein started out in business, men held the upper hand, financially and 					socially. And men decreed that respectable women should go unpainted.

				Over the next half-century, the beauty industry ran 					hand in hand with women’s progress toward an equal place in the public world. 					Painting one’s face and cutting one’s hair signaled a new universe of choice and 					possibility. It is no coincidence that lipstick, between the 1920s and the 					1950s, was bright, bright red. Helena Rubinstein’s motives were of course 					commercial: she wanted to be rich. But she also wanted independence, the right 					to control both her life and her money. And the cosmetics industry not only 					granted her wishes, it reflected her customers’ similar aspirations.

				Today the wheel has come full circle. Cosmetics and 					cosmetic “procedures,” far from being unthinkable, have become almost 					compulsory. Who, now, dares be the only one in the room with wrinkles? 					Ironically, although women’s independence and equality are enshrined in law, 					their appearance is once again under someone else’s control.

				And that someone is usually a man. Ninety percent 					of those “having work done,” both in Europe and America, are women. And 90 					percent of cosmetic surgeons are men. Although the British Association of 					Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons has 850 members, only 98 of them are women. 					In America, not one of New York magazine’s nominated 					“Best Doctors” for cosmetic surgery in 2008 was a woman. An online trawl through 					plastic surgeons in New York and Los Angeles turned up only four women’s 					names.

				This gender imbalance does not mean that male 					plastic surgeons exercise some sinister power over their female patients. 					However, it does reflect the extent to which, in this world of supposed 					equality, men rather than women still tend to be the active agents. And nowhere 					is this truer than in the world the beauty industry now inhabits: the world of 					big business.

				In her groundbreaking book The 						Feminine Mystique, published in 1963, Betty Friedan asked why so many 					highly educated American women were effectively abandoning careers. Instead, 					they were devoting their energies to homemaking, which, despite all the 					propaganda in its favor, left them bored, frustrated, depressed, and 					unfulfilled. Friedan concluded that in postwar America, women’s “really crucial 					function . . . [was] to buy 					more things for the home.” An entire industry of 					advertising and market research devoted itself to persuading them to do so. And 					since the marketing men had decided that “a woman’s attitude toward housekeeping 					appliances cannot be separated from her attitude towards homemaking in general,” 					it had become commercially imperative that as many women as possible spend time 					at home being what business labeled “true housewives.” From the sellers’ 					standpoint, career women were considered “unhealthy.” And the persuaders had 					conveyed their message so successfully that the American career woman had become 					an endangered species.39

				Partly as a result of Friedan’s book, that changed. 					But the sellers still needed to sell. So they expanded their sights to include 					not just the home but the body—which of course accompanies you wherever you go 					and whoever you are. And although the beauty business, the industry concerned 					with bodies, had traditionally been a female enterprise, that now began to 					change. The structure of the market thus remained what it had been pre-Friedan. 					The buyers were mostly women, the sellers mostly men.

				Helena Rubinstein, Elizabeth Arden, Estée Lauder, 					the great names in twentieth-century cosmetics, got where they did because men 					hadn’t yet cottoned on to beauty’s commercial possibilities. But by the time 					Friedan began her research, they had begun to do so. Patrick O’Higgins, offered 					a job by Helena Rubinstein in 1955, wandered uncertainly past the drugstore 					windows, eyeing the products. His first thought was, “Golly! Who ever buys all 					this crap?” and his second, “Women’s names! Women’s work?” Only when he noticed 					the other names—Max Factor, Revlon, Charles Antell—did he reflect that “The 					beauty business is an enormous industry.”40 And 					that made it suitable for men. Once the likes of Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden 					had made beauty’s commercial possibilities apparent, the boys moved in.

				Now they have taken full control. The beauty 					business has become very big business indeed—and big business in the 					twenty-first century is a male preserve. A survey released in March 2010 found 					that only 10 percent of directors in Britain’s top 100 companies are women, and 					twenty-five of the top firms had no women board members at all.41 Whatever the potion, the firm manufacturing it 					will almost certainly be run by men. And that firm will likely be L’Oréal, which 					now owns more than 400 subsidiaries and 500 brands, spanning 150 different 					countries, including (in addition to Helena Rubinstein) consumer products 					Maybelline, Softsheen, Garnier, CCB; luxury products Lancôme, Biotherm, Kiehl’s, 					Shue Uemura; the fragrance lines of Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren, Cacharel, 					Lanvin, Viktor & Rolf, Diesel, and YSL Beauté; professional products 					Kerastase, Redken, Matrix, Mizani, Shue Uemura Art of Hair; cosmoceuticals 					Vichy, La Roche Posay, Innéov, Skinceuticals, Sanoflore; The Body Shop; and 					Laboratories Ylang, the main producer of cosmetics in Argentina, where L’Oréal 					now controls 25 percent of the cosmetics market.

				Seventy percent of L’Oréal’s chemists are women. In 					Lindsay Owen-Jones’s words, “the future of the company is in their hands at that 						level.”42 But the board is another matter. 					L’Oréal’s board of directors contains three women—Liliane Bettencourt, her 					daughter Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, and Annette Roux, whose family runs a 					yacht-making business in Brittany, not far from L’Arcouest. But none of these 					sits on the ten-strong management committee, where all the firm’s real planning 					is done. At the time of this writing, the committee contained just one woman: 					the director of communications, Béatrice Dautresme—the same proportion as in the 					British survey and, as it happens, an exact echo of the proportions of males to 					females among cosmetic surgeons.

				The constant concern of boards such as 					L’Oréal’s—the ambition of all big business, as shareholders press for 					ever-higher dividends—is expansion: to increase revenues and profits. And as the 					main cosmetic market of mostly middle-aged women approaches saturation, new 					avenues are being explored. One highly controversial trend encourages very young 					women to start Botox treatment preemptively, to prevent lines before they form: 					a 2009 market research survey found that there was particular growth of interest 					in “procedures” among teenagers.43

				There is also the still largely untapped pool of 					men. Helena Rubinstein’s wartime cosmetics packs for soldiers developed into a 					postwar male market for such products as deodorants and aftershave. But despite 					breakthroughs (such as President Reagan’s much-touted use of Grecian 2000 hair 					dye) men never went for cosmetics in a big way. However, today’s fixation with 					youthfulness and attainable perfection affects both sexes. As the world gets 					fatter, and man-boobs (“moobs”) proliferate, more and more men are opting for 					breast reductions. The British Association of Plastic Surgeons reported an 					80-percent rise in demand for this operation in 2009.44 And they’re worrying about their wrinkles. Boots’ “Protect and 					Perfect” line now includes a special range for men, while in a recent 					advertising campaign, a succession of aging male icons including Pierce Brosnan, 					the last James Bond but one, fronted for L’Oréal’s tautening cream “Revitalift.” 					If straight men can be induced to share what was once a dread exclusive to women 					and gays, the potential market at once grows by almost 50 percent.

				Whatever the sex of the consumer, however, the 					world of cosmetics is still, as it always has been, associated with social 					control. In Madame Rachel’s day, the argument was about keeping women in their 					place. For Helena Rubinstein, cosmetics were her route to emancipation; for her 					generation of women, they symbolized freedom. For Eugène Schueller, convinced 					that control and authority were essential aspects of a good society in which 					“Adam delved while Eve span,” they paradoxically conferred the means to enforce 					dictatorship. And now, when Madame Rachel’s “Beautiful For Ever” is literally 					and routinely attainable, the cosmetics world is the visible expression of a 					society in which anything is available to those with the means to buy it. The 					body has become a mere canvas, upon which the digital-age beauty business 					remasters our image of what is physically possible. But since perfection is ipso 					facto unattainable, what is really on offer, in the world of beauty as 					elsewhere, is infinite discontent.

				Work has been my best beauty treatment! It keeps 					the wrinkles out of the mind and the spirit. It helps to keep a woman young. It 					certainly keeps a woman alive!

				—HELENA 						RUBINSTEIN, 1956

				Helena 					Rubinstein died at ninety-two, in full command of her empire. At the time of 					this writing, Eugène Schueller’s daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, is eighty-seven 					years old and still an active member of the L’Oréal board. Madame Rubinstein 					personified her own views of what a woman’s life might be; Madame Bettencourt 					was raised in accordance with her father’s quite opposite views. Which is the 					more successful life model? Or, to put it another way, which, if either, leads 					to contentment?

				If money is the key, then these must have been the 					happiest of lives. Helena Rubinstein died before rich lists, but would certainly 					have figured on them had they existed in her day. And in 2007 Liliane 					Bettencourt, with a fortune of $20.7 billion, was, according to Forbes, the wealthiest woman in the world, and its 					twelfth-richest person. By 2009, both her ranking and her fortune had slipped, 					to twenty-first place and $13.4 billion, respectively (she was rumored to have 					lost “an undisclosed amount of money” in a fund overseen by René-Thierry Magnon 					de la Villehuchet, whose judgment was less impressive than his name and who 					committed suicide after losing $1.4 billion in Bernie Madoff’s infamous Ponzi 						scam).1 Her place as wealthiest woman had 					been claimed by a Walmart heiress. But although comparable losses would 					devastate public finances in the city-sized economies, sums like these more 					usually represent, at the level of individual lives they can make no conceivable 					difference. For a Bettencourt, the only real difficulty is in disposal. How can 					one spend even a fraction of that money? Solving that problem has been one of 					her life’s chief occupations. “Fortune is an opportunity,” she told Le Figaro in 2008. “You only need to look around—there 					are actions that impose themselves—and then go for it. Simply, without ulterior 					motives, without calculation, without waiting for a ‘return on investment.’ 					”

				But money, however plentiful, cannot immunize its 					possessors against misfortune. And poverty, though always an inconvenience, is 					not always a fatal drawback. Helena Rubinstein was raised in poverty, but her 					subsequent instinct always to include her sisters in her good fortune attests to 					a strong sense of family solidarity. By contrast, Liliane Schueller, born to 					parents who had already become rich, suffered a cold and lonely childhood. When 					she was five, the rich little girl’s mother died of an abscess on the liver. And 					this calamity would shape Liliane’s life.

				She has only once spoken publicly about this, in an 					interview with Egoïste magazine in 1987. “They came 					to fetch me in the middle of the night and I saw my father on his knees at the 					foot of my mother’s bed. . . . When she died there was no more music 					in the house. She was a musician. A very beautiful woman, very tall, who got on 					easily with other people. . . . It meant my father was left to raise 					me as he wanted. When he had time, that is. . . . It isn’t easy being 					raised by your father when your mother’s gone. There’s an absence of 						tenderness.”2

				Liliane’s upbringing certainly presented her father 					with a problem. His wife’s death occurred at a moment when he was diversifying 					in numerous directions—celluloid, photographic film, Russia, paint. There could 					be no question of looking after Liliane himself even had he wanted to (which he 					surely did not, being a man for whom child-rearing was doctrinally a woman’s 					job). So he sent her to a Dominican convent school, where she remained for ten 					years. But the mother superior, though kind, was no substitute for the mother 					who had died. Nor did the holidays bring any respite from austerity. Home, 					Liliane remembered, was “all about the business, the economic climate, working 					hard.”

				This did not imply grimness—on the contrary, 					Schueller enjoyed luxury. He filled his houses with specially commissioned 					furniture, owned a yacht and a Rolls-Royce. But he was a particularly unsuitable 					lone parent for an only daughter. Business was his sole interest: “Work was how 					he communicated with me, and vice-versa. When he talked to me about a book or 					some other thing, he was still talking about work. . . . Psychology, 					action, ideas, that’s still all business.” Yet this fascinating world was one 					into which, on principle, Liliane could never be admitted. Although she was sent 					to work in her father’s factory during the last three weeks of every vacation 					from the age of fifteen, starting by sticking labels on bottles, her father’s 					writings made it clear that there was never any possibility she might succeed 					him. Admittedly his wife had kept the business going while he was away during 					World War I, but that was out of necessity. For Liliane there was no such 					necessity. Nor, despite her obvious intellectual capacities, did she attend 					university. It was her husband who became L’Oréal’s vice president, her husband 					who, cushioned by his wife’s money, became a senator and a minister. Her job was 					to support, partner, entertain, do charity work. That was what women did.

				Of course it was not what Helena Rubinstein did—and 					her father disapproved of her quite as heartily as Schueller would have done in 					similar circumstances. But although Herzl Rubinstein hated what his daughter had 					become, the home he provided, and the Jewish tradition of strong women that 					underlay its culture, gave her (albeit unwittingly, and to his horror) the 					self-confidence to break away. And the consequence was a life defined not by 					money but by the business success that produced it. Like Eugène Schueller, of 					whom this was also true, Rubinstein enjoyed her money—the more so since, like 					him, she had once been poor—but it was their work, not their bank balance, that 					mattered most to them. This was something of which Rubinstein, to the end of her 					long span, was acutely conscious, and which she profoundly valued. Work was, as 					she said, the best beauty treatment.

				The upbringing Schueller gave his daughter, 					however, meant that this satisfying life could never be hers. That would have 					necessitated rebellion, which for her was unthinkable. Her love and respect for 					her father were “visceral,” a friend observed, her admiration for him, 					limitless. When he died, and she found herself owner of the business, she 					became, above all, the keeper of his flame—which included his values.3 Yet that same upbringing, with its constant 					emphasis on achievement, also ensured that, paradoxically, she could never be 					satisfied by the life for which it destined her. “As far as people are 					concerned, if a woman’s rich, she can’t be intelligent,” Madame Bettencourt told 						Egoïste defensively. “People park you in a 					corner and leave you there. Rich—it’s not an agreeable word. In fact it’s an 					ugly word. I prefer fortune. That implies luck.”

				The sense conveyed in that interview is of a life 					pervaded by an undefined frustration. Raised to consume, able to possess 					anything she might desire, consumption holds no glamor for Schueller’s daughter. 					When an art critic cattily observed that Helena Rubinstein possessed 					“unimportant paintings by every important painter of the nineteenth and 					twentieth centuries,” Madame retorted, “I may not have quality but I have 					quantity. Quality’s nice but quantity makes a show.” 4 “Making a show,” though, is the last thing Bettencourt has ever 					wanted. “I like emptiness more than clutter,” she told Egoïste. “Even if I fall in love with a painting, I’m quite happy to 					see it on someone else’s wall.” Rubinstein kept her jewels in a filing cabinet, 					sorted alphabetically, A for amethysts, B for beryls, D for diamonds, ready to 					hand for instant use. Liliane Bettencourt owns an equally astonishing collection 					of gems—bags of cut but unset stones, diamond necklaces, shelves of emeralds, 					rubies, sapphires—but they are kept in a bank vault whose contents rarely see 					the light of day,5 while no photograph shows 					her wearing anything more extravagant than a pair of stud earrings. Rubinstein’s 					New York living room, like everything else about her, was tasteless but full of 					gusto. It sported an acid-green carpet designed by Miró, twenty Victorian carved 					chairs covered in purple and magenta velvets, Chinese pearl-inlaid coffee 					tables, gold Turkish floor lamps, life-sized Easter Island sculptures, 					six-foot-tall blue opaline vases, African masks around the fireplace, and 					paintings covering every inch of wall space. But in Liliane Bettencourt’s 					tasteful salon, gusto is conspicuous by its absence, the dead hand of the 					interior decorator everywhere apparent.

				These contrasting styles are partly a function of 					milieu. Slender and terrifically elegant—in 2009 she was elected a permanent 					member of Vanity Fair’s best-dressed Hall of 					Fame—Liliane Bettencourt is a supreme exemplar of “bcbg,” bon chic, bon genre, a style to which all Frenchwomen aspire and 					whose standards, of both chic and genre, are set by the couture-clad haute bourgeoisie 					of which Madame Bettencourt is a leading member. In bcbg, taste is all, excess 					is suspect, and a rather uniform, perfectly executed, expensive understatement 					rules. The whole point is not to draw attention to oneself. The Bettencourts’ 					dislike of the public eye was legendary: for them, one of the privileges riches 					bought was total privacy. When Bruno Abescat, a financial journalist at L’Express, set out to write a book about “France’s 					wealthiest couple,” it was a year before he was able to get near them in the 					flesh—and then only at a public distribution of prizes financed by the 					Bettencourt Schueller Foundation.6

				For Helena Rubinstein, by contrast, the whole point 					of spending money was to show you had money to spend. If nobody knew, half the 					pleasure was lost. In her milieu, wealth validated every eccentricity, and such 					was her status within it that even her ignorance was accepted as part of her 					personality. During a lunch in New York the conversation turned to the sad fate 					of Joan of Arc, burned as a heretic by an ancestor of Edith Sitwell, who was one 					of the guests. “Somebody had to do it!” cried Madame—an observation so 					stunningly crass that it would have barred her forever from bcbg circles. But 					the New Yorkers simply turned the conversation elsewhere.

				The essentials of personal life, however, are 					unaffected by such details. And in that department Bettencourt, happily married 					for fifty-seven years, with a happily married daughter and grandchildren living 					just down the road in Neuilly, would seem to have beaten Rubinstein hands down. 					In 1987, after thirty-seven years of marriage, Liliane described her husband as 					“someone quite out of the ordinary”7; after his 					death in 2007 she remained in love with his memory. He was “charming, alive, 					intelligent. We were together fifty years, there was something indescribable 					between us, and then business and politics—it was so exciting.”8

				By contrast, Rubinstein’s intimate life was a 					disaster. Her first husband, whom she married for love, constantly ran after 					other women. Her elder son bored her; her younger son, Horace, whom she adored, 					quarreled with her incessantly, made nothing of his life, and died in his 					forties. Artchil, whom she married for companionship, predeceased her by twelve 					years. So she blotted out the unbearable (Horace’s death, Titus’s infidelity) 					and compensated for the absence of real personal attachments with compulsive 					hyperactivity. And yet—despite this catalog of emotional catastrophes—her life 					was fulfilled in a way that Bettencourt’s never has been.

				There is one striking similarity in the lives of 					Helena Rubinstein and Liliane Bettencourt. Each, in old age, established a 					friendship with a much younger man. As the years passed, these friendships 					became the women’s most important emotional focus. But the two relationships, 					apparently so similar, were quite different in emphasis. And those differences 					reveal, perhaps more than anything else in the lives of these two formidable 					women, their true vulnerabilities.

				Helena Rubinstein’s young man, Patrick O’Higgins, 					was the impecunious playboy son of Irish diplomats. He first noticed her in 					1950, a tiny nexus of palpitating impatience barreling down the New York street 					ahead of him, furiously tapping her foot when lights forced her to wait before 					crossing the road. He had no idea who this vision might be, but soon afterwards 					ran into her at a cocktail party and was introduced. She was then seventy-eight, 					at the height of her power in the social and fashionable worlds. He was fifty 					years her junior, handsome, charming, and disorganized. She at once took a fancy 					to him, but although their conversation was noted by Rubinstein-watchers, 					nothing came of it until a year or so later, when out of the blue she asked him 					to lunch. After a copious meal (“I need to keep up my energy!”) they went on to 					see Ben-Hur (“Most interesting! I’m glad the Jewish 					boy won!”) then returned to her apartment, where, over a glass of whiskey, she 					asked him, “What do you really want to do with your life?” When he hesitated, 					she at once took over: “Let Me tell you!”9 And tell him she did, from then on until the 					day she died, fifteen years later.

				O’Higgins’ role in Madame’s life was to do and be 					whatever she required at the time. He accompanied her everywhere, as secretary, 					nurse, escort, interpreter, PR man, social director, and majordomo. Her strange 					and compelling personality mesmerized him. A floating bachelor (he may well have 					been gay, though he never openly admitted it—in the 1950s and sixties, when he 					knew Madame, homosexuality was still unmentionable), he received from her a 					focus his life had hitherto lacked. After first Artchil and then Horace died, 					they became increasingly close, until toward the end of her life he described 					their relationship as that of “a devoted son and a demanding mother.”10 “Who’s your goy?” the Israeli prime minister 					David Ben-Gurion once asked her during a long and tedious dinner. “That’s 					Patrick!” Madame beamed. “And . . . and, yes, he 						is my goy.”11

				Significantly, money played a relatively small part 					in their relationship. When she first employed him they agreed on a salary of 					$7,000 a year. To him, at the time, it seemed a fortune, though as the years 					went on he realized that others who did considerably less than he were paid 					considerably more. But although he often remarked on Madame’s habitual tightness 					with money, O’Higgins never contemplated leaving her—or not on that account. 					Their one serious contretemps was emotional, when she refused to admit he might 					need to mourn the death of his mother. Her refusal was partly a jealous 					reaction—she hated the thought of sharing him, even with the dead. And partly, 					too, it reflected her horror of death and refusal to admit its existence. Her 					invariable response to bereavement was to pretend it hadn’t happened, drowning 					grief in perpetual motion. But O’Higgins was made of less stern (one might say, 					more human) stuff, and her callousness brought on a nervous breakdown.

				They were reunited in the end. Distraught at his 					absence, she wrote him letters: “I want to forget our differences. I hope you 					know that I love you as a mother. The mother you 					lost!” For a while he was unmoved—particularly since those letters somehow never 					enclosed promised checks. But eventually “I . . . realized that it was 					impossible for me to leave Madame. I couldn’t escape from her. . . . 					Her letters had touched me and I longed to be by her side.”12 From then until the day she died, he was with 					her.

				Rubinstein spent her last year putting finishing 					touches to her will. She left O’Higgins $5,000 in cash plus a yearly income of 					$2,000 “so he won’t starve.” He calculated that, should he survive twenty years 					(in fact he died thirteen years later, in 1980), this amount must represent a 					capital outlay of between sixty and eighty thousand dollars. Might she not have 					left him a larger sum outright? But then he recalled a conversation in which 					she’d said, “If I was to leave you twenty-five thousand dollars in cash, what 					would you do with it?” He’d replied, “Spend it! Have a lovely holiday!” at which 					she’d nodded sagely—and acted accordingly, in what she saw as his best 						interests.13 Given his devotion and her 					great wealth, the bequest was far from generous. But that did not affect the 					love and respect he felt for her. They shine through the funny, affectionate 					memoir he left of their life together, a testament to the humanity that lay 					behind Rubinstein’s overbearing and egotistical façade.

				Liliane Bettencourt’s young man was (and is) a 					different matter. François-Marie Banier is a well-known photographer, novelist, 					and all-round man-about-town twenty-five years her junior. As with O’Higgins and 					Rubinstein, the relationship is quasi-filial, with no hint of sex. Banier, 					unlike O’Higgins, is openly gay. “I see him with his partner, who is charming, 					cultivated, and intelligent,” Bettencourt told the Journal 						du Dimanche in 2008.14

				As with Rubinstein, too, the friendship is the more 					significant in that Madame Bettencourt has evidently found close personal 					relationships difficult. “I like to keep a distance between myself and other 					people,” she told Egoïste. She had to be persuaded 					into marriage, and does not seem to have felt wholly at ease even with her own 					daughter, Françoise. “She was always rather an inscrutable child,” Bettencourt 					told an interviewer in 2008, a year after her friendship with Banier had sparked 					a public fight between the two. “She got on better with my husband. 					Mother-daughter relations are very different from father-daughter 						relations.”15

				Banier has thus achieved an intimacy denied to 					anyone else. But where Patrick O’Higgins’ attachment to Helena Rubinstein was 					independent of what she paid him (never, in any case, more than a very moderate 					salary), Banier’s relationship with Madame Bettencourt appears to be rather 					different.

				The two first met in 1969, at the home of the 					journalists Pierre and Hélène Lazareff, Neuilly neighbors of the Bettencourts. 					Madame Bettencourt was then in her forties—as Banier remembered, “the most 					sought-after woman in society—very impressive and extraordinarily 						beautiful.”16 But they did not become close 					at that time. That happened eighteen years later, in 1987, when Bettencourt was 					sixty-five and Banier thirty-nine. He was assigned to photograph her for the 						Egoïste interview, they became friends, and the 					friendship flourished. Banier quickly became a habitué of the Bettencourt 					mansion; inevitably, Madame Bettencourt was at home much more than her busy 					husband. Soon he was not just her friend but her principal friend.

				Ironically, during that interview, one of the 					questions was about whether she wasn’t afraid of being loved just for her money. 					“How would one like to be loved, then?” she said. “Does one have to be ugly and 					undersized and fat before one can know that one’s loved for oneself?”

				That she loves Banier for himself is beyond doubt. 					And she is not alone in doing so. As he himself put it, “Wherever I go, I make 					waves” (“Il y a toujours eu de vacarme derrière 						moi”).17 Louis Aragon was besotted 					by him; he charmed François Mitterrand, Samuel Beckett, and Vladimir Horowitz. 					When he wanted to be an actor, Robert Bresson and Eric Rohmer gave him parts in 					their films. His novels—three published before he was twenty-five—were the talk 					of Paris. Diane von Furstenberg prefers his photographs to anyone else’s; Johnny 					Depp insists Banier’s portraits of him are unique and made Banier godfather to 					his daughter Lily-Rose.

				Banier approaches all social encounters with the 					same all-consuming concentration. “Not many people are really interested in 					others. But I’m genuinely fascinated by everyone I meet, whether it’s someone I 					know or a passer-by in the street. I speak to them with my real voice. 						. . .”18 It could almost be a 					definition of how charm works. The photographs, the books, the films, are all 					secondary: his real metier is to enchant. It is compulsive—and the compulsive is 					by definition compelling.

				Banier’s particular specialism, however, is wealthy 					and well-connected old ladies, whose pursuit appears to have been the first of 					his many careers. He embarked upon it at the age of nineteen, when he got to 					know Marie-Laure de Noailles, the maecenas of the Paris avant-garde, then 					sixty-four. “Didn’t you have anything better to do at the age of nineteen?” 					asked an interviewer; to which Banier responded, “It’s as though you asked me 					why I bothered to visit Leonardo da Vinci.”19

				Well, up to a point. Unlike Leonardo, wealth, not 					talent, had been Madame de Noailles’s entrée into the artistic world. Banier, on 					the other hand, was poor: his father worked at the Citroën factory.20 Both father and son, however, rejected the 					fact of poverty. Banier père hid his real life even 					from his family, pretending he was the bourgeois he dreamed of being; and his 					son, whom he ill-treated and who hated him, inherited this dream and 					singlemindedly fulfilled it. François-Marie followed the old precept: if you 					want to be rich, go where the money is. And it worked.

				In 1971, when he was twenty-four, Banier published 					a novel, Le Passé composé (The Perfect Tense), which 					is in some ways transparently autobiographical. The hero, also called François 					(but whose surname, de Chevigny, implies membership of a class to which Banier 					did not, yet, belong), is poor but would like to be rich. He latches on to a 					rich girl from Neuilly, Cécile, and before their first date wanders through the 					Bois de Boulogne near her house, clutching a record he will give her as a 					present. “One day this boy, wandering around with a record in his hand, will 					have a big house with a big garden. People will say, ‘Did you see? That’s 					François de Chevigny! He’s got lots of money. He has a house full of beautiful 					things, and a huge garden with enormous trees.’ ”21 Now Banier, too, has all that. When speaking of his elderly lady 					friends, he never mentions their wealth. But it appears to have been the central 					fact of these relationships.

				Of course, there were other attractions. Madame de 					Noailles knew everyone, and introduced Banier to her world. He repaid her with 					devoted attention. When she died of pneumonia in 1970, it was Banier who heard 					her last words. By then he had already made another conquest—Madeleine Castaing, 					the “diva of decorators.” Castaing owned a smart shop on the corner of rue Jacob 					and rue Bonaparte and was famous, among other things, for her collection of 					paintings by Chaim Soutine, whom she had known in the 1920s. (When Banier’s 					fictional François is courting Cécile, one of his lures is a promise to 					introduce her to Madeleine Castaing and show her the famous collecton of 						Soutines.22) When Castaing’s husband of 					fifty years died in 1969, the young Banier obtained an introduction and stepped 					in to console her;23 the friendship lasted 					until her death in 1992, at the age of ninety-eight. The photographs he took of 					her in extreme old age, nightgowned and wigless on her staircase, became famous. 					Her family detested them—saw them, indeed, as a form of abuse—but according to 					Banier it was she who initiated this photo shoot.24 “You’ve got a nerve,” he says Castaing said when she saw the 					photographs. “But that’s fine: It’s me.”25 They 					were exhibited everywhere, and launched Banier’s photographic career.

				Asked whether Banier “tried to use the friendship 					for material profit,” Castaing’s grandson said that thefts of family property 					had been a constant topic of conversation between his parents for as long as he 					could remember. A Soutine, he said, had disappeared during the 1930s, probably 					stolen by the famously light-fingered writer Maurice Sachs; another went—who 					knows where?—during the 1980s, along with his grandparents’ letters from 					Picasso, Satie, and Cocteau. “And as it happens, I know that my grandmother gave 					François-Marie Banier a place with a conservatory in rue Visconti, in the 6th 					arrondissment of Paris. Things were just like that . . .”26

				By 1987, when Banier met Liliane Bettencourt for 					the second time, Madeleine Castaing was already ninety-three. Clearly, this 					source of support could not last much longer. So it was a happy chance that, at 					the crucial moment, another generous friend should present herself. Pressed as 					to whether he didn’t sometimes think his penchant for elderly ladies a little 					strange, Banier replied, “The young have fewer secrets than the old. It isn’t 					just that they’re old, they’re loners. Also I find a person more beautiful at 					108 than at eight years old. But I photograph young people too.”27

				What he did not add was that the old people who 					seemed most to interest him were also rich. Immaterial as this may be to Banier 					(“I don’t take from people, I let them blossom, because I love and respect 						them,”28) this financial nexus is what the 					world chiefly sees. And in the case of Liliane Bettencourt, the pickings have 					been unimaginably huge. Beginning in 1996, there were regular outings when her 					chauffeur, under oath to tell no one, “particularly not M. Bettencourt,” would 					drive Liliane the short distance from Neuilly to the Trocadero, where Banier 					would be waiting. Together they would continue to the nearby avenue Georges 					Mandel, where Banier’s notary had his office; there she would make over money to 					Banier, and the notary would check the paperwork.29

				As the years went on, the gifts got larger. In 					2002, $14 million (€11 million) was handed over; in 2003, $315 million (€250 					million), mostly in the form of a life insurance contract of which he is the 					beneficiary; in 2004, $7.6 million (€6 million); in 2005, $71 million (€56 					million); in 2006, $315 million (€250 million); in 2007, $2.5 million (€2 					million). Nine paintings by Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian, and Leger have been 					signed over to Banier: they remain in Neuilly, but he will possess them after 					Bettencourt’s death.30 According to one 					account, he no sooner admired a Matisse painting hanging in one of her 					houses—its blue, he remarked, was “the color of our friendship”—than she said, 					“It’s yours, François-Marie!” The Bettencourt Schueller Foundation, which 					supports both artistic activities, such as painting and filmmaking, and science, 					in particular medical research, has an annual budget of $160 million. That is a 					lot of money. But it is dwarfed by the untold wealth that has been lavished on 						Banier.1

				“There have never been quarrels in the Bettencourt 					family, particularly not about money or power,” admiringly declared their 					chronicler in 2002.31 But this happy state of 					affairs was soon overtaken by events. If André Bettencourt remained unaware how 					attached his wife had become to Banier, as her instructions to the chauffeur 					would seem to indicate, their daughter Françoise both suspected what was afoot 					and was deeply disturbed by it. A few days after M. Bettencourt’s death in 					November, 2007, Banier allegedly tried to get the new widow to adopt him as a 					son, which would give him the right to half her estate. A month later, Françoise 					Bettencourt-Meyers launched a criminal complaint accusing him of abus de faiblesse, arguing that her increasingly frail 					mother was no longer capable of withstanding emotional pressure, and producing 					copious evidence from Madame Bettencourt’s staff showing that Banier had bullied 					her.

				Liliane Bettencourt indignantly denies that she is 					vulnerable. She argues, reasonably enough, that she is entitled to do whatever 					she likes with her own money. When the case first came to court there were 					rumors that she had even called in President Sarkozy, another Neuilly neighbor, 					to get it thrown out—a maneuver, if that is what it was, that failed (and which 					she denied, asserting, accurately enough, that Sarkozy “has other things to 					think about”).2

				And although it is unarguable that Banier has made 					a profitable career out of befriending rich elderly ladies, a habit some might 					find distasteful, the ladies themselves have not appeared to object. Why would 					they? Few old ladies are courted and made much of by glamorous younger men, and 					many might enjoy the experience. From their standpoint, Banier provided, and 					provides, the one thing money can’t buy. Who can put a price on friendship? “I 					make Liliane rich, Banier makes her live,” Lindsay Owen-Jones is reported as 						saying.32 “He’s an artist, that’s what I 					like,” Madame Bettencourt explained in 2008, after the friendship had become a 					matter of scandal. “Artists see things differently. Times change, everything’s 					moving, you’ve got to stay in the swim . . . I was with him just a few 					days ago in the United States. We met some most interesting people. A big 					family, very artistic, with ten children. It’s not much fun only seeing people 					like oneself, is it?”33

				An interesting light has recently been shed on 					Bettencourt-Meyers’ motivation in bringing this case. She is, after all, already 					unimaginably rich: Liliane Bettencourt has made over a large part of her estate 					to her daughter. Why, in those circumstances, would any daughter want to cause 					her aged mother such anguish, dragging her through the courts and making the 					family a focus for public prurience? In a similar situation Castaing’s family 					drew back from this path. “As far as I’m concerned these aren’t legal matters, 					they’re about something else altogether,” her grandson remarked.34

				The answer, rumor has it, is business: the business 					in which neither Liliane nor Françoise Bettencourt, being female, play an active 					part. However, Jean-Pierre Meyers, Françoise’s husband, is both a L’Oréal board 					member and (more significantly) a member of its management committee. He is also 					on the board of Nestlé; and there are hints that he “would like to do Nestlé a 						favour.”35 Nestlé owns 30 percent of 					L’Oréal, the Bettencourts, 31 percent; in 2004 Liliane Bettencourt signed an 					agreement freezing these holdings until six months after her death. It is common 					knowledge that Nestlé has for years wanted to acquire L’Oréal. If it can be 					proved that Madame Bettencourt was not competent when she signed that agreement, 					it is nullified, and Nestlé is free to move.3

				Between Banier and Meyers, Liliane Bettencourt 					seems to be at other people’s mercy. Or rather, at the mercy of the men in her 					life, starting with her father, whom she revered and could never contradict. 					Schueller brought up his daughter to do what he thought women were made for—to 					embellish the lives of her menfolk. And it has been the pattern of her life ever 					since.

				Helena Rubinstein was no one’s patsy: the 					self-effacing do not become captains of industry. Insufferable, selfish, 					bullying, crass, she did the exploiting, if any. For 					Schueller, this was the very reason why women should not aspire to the 					workplace. But Rubinstein showed, by example, and in a way that no woman had 					ever done before, that Schueller’s prescription for the female sex was not just 					patronizing: it was—for those with ambitions beyond the home such as his own 					daughter might have nourished—actively cruel.

				Rubinstein’s astonishing self-confidence resounds 					through every word ever written about her. It was what enabled her to create the 					life she desired, and the fact of having achieved that life constantly 					reinforced it. And here, surely, is the core of the matter. For self-confidence 					is what the beauty business has always been about, has always been its true 					commodity. The creams, the paints, the injections, the operations, are merely 					routes to that all-important end. Self-confidence was what the Victorians wanted 					to deny their womenfolk. It was what Helena Rubinstein and her customers aimed 					to achieve through cosmetics. Selling it gave Eugène Schueller the riches to buy 					power. But in a nice irony, the company he used as a cash-cow now arguably 					wields more real power—trading, as it does, in self-confidence—than any 					political party, any economist, ever has or ever will.

				The 					Banier affair, though it aroused a good deal of attention, seemed relatively 					trivial—if not to those concerned, at least to the world at large. But in the 					summer of 2010 it suddenly acquired a new and scandalous political dimension. 					Liliane Bettencourt’s staff were already outraged by what they saw as Banier’s 					bullying of their employer—the more so when he reacted to their criticisms by 					having several of them sacked after years of faithful service. Now the 					increasingly deaf and infirm Madame Bettencourt was, it seemed to them, being 					mercilessly manipulated by yet another interested party—her financial adviser, 					Patrice de Maistre. So her butler decided to take matters into his own hands and 					acquire proof of what was going on. He did so by bugging his cocktail tray—an 					item, in his experience, always central to these conversations. He then passed 					the memory card containing the recordings to Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, who 					transferred them to twenty-eight CDs that she delivered, three weeks later, to 					the police.

				What emerged was dynamite. The recorded 					conversations between Madame Bettencourt and de Maistre showed that Banier had 					not been the only one allegedly benefiting from the L’Oréal heiress’s open 					purse. There had also, it seemed, been sub-rosa cash subventions to politicians, 					including the minister responsible for taxation, whose helpful inattention would 					of course have been highly advantageous to the Bettencourt interests, and whose 					wife was conveniently employed by de Maistre in the Bettencourt office. And 					although the legal limit for individual contributions to French political 					campaigns was €7,500, the election campaign of 					Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president (and a member of André Bettencourt’s old 					party), appeared to have benefited to the tune of €150,000. It also transpired that André Bettencourt, while he was 					alive, had kept a chest full of cash conveniently at hand, cash that he doled 					out every election season to members of his political party, the UMP (Union pour 					un mouvement populaire), in unmarked envelopes.

				There were other recordings, too, of telephone 					discussions between de Maistre and Fabrice Goguel, a tax lawyer and onetime 					official adviser to Madame Bettencourt on tax affairs. These conversations gave 					rise to allegations that Goguel was still involved with the estate—not advising 					on tax avoidance, which of course is legal, but on tax evasion and money 					laundering, which very much are not. Tens of millions had been stashed away in a 					Swiss bank account; other conversations seemed to show that de Maistre, worried 					about Switzerland’s new openness on such matters, was anxious to transfer this 					money to Singapore, where it could be more securely hidden. There was also an 					island in the Seychelles that had never been declared to the tax authorities. 					Bettencourt’s people asserted that the island no longer belonged to her and had 					been given to Banier, but Banier denied this: He had no use for it; there were 					too many sharks and mosquitoes. . . . Twenty years after the 					Frydman revelations, L’Oréal’s owners were once again enveloped in 					controversy.

				The parallels between the Nazi scandal of 1989–1995 					and the affaire Bettencourt that began in 2007 (and 					which continues to fill the headlines at the time of this writing in summer 					2010) are striking. In both cases, what began as something relatively banal 					expanded and metamorphosed into a huge political scandal. In 1989, the spark was 					a disagreement over a board meeting that may or may not have taken place and in 					2007, a family quarrel over money. In both cases, the event that moved the 					affair onto a new, hotly political plane was a wholly unpredictable chance 					event. If L’Oréal’s François Dalle had not decided to bring his old friend Jean 					Frydman into the business at what turned out to be exactly the wrong moment, 					Eugène Schueller’s Nazi past, with all its ramifications, would have remained 					conveniently forgotten, as so many similar pasts were forgotten. And if Liliane 					Bettencourt’s butler had not conceived the wholly baroque notion of bugging his 					cocktail tray, the affaire Bettencourt would have 					remained the comparatively innocuous affaire 					Banier.

				For the public, the affaire 						Bettencourt’s chief scandalous revelation (perhaps less a revelation 					than a confirmation of what we always suspect but can rarely prove) was the way 					the very rich and very powerful casually assume that the laws governing everyone 					else are, for them, purely optional. Taxes need be paid only by the 					disorganized, limits on political contributions are routinely ignored, public 					servants can always be bought, and the happy recipients of cash-stuffed 					envelopes naturally do all they can to forward the interests of their 					paymasters.

				The tax aspect, at least, would not have shocked 					Eugène Schueller. He was paranoid about taxation, ending his life as a supporter 					of Pierre Poujade, the anti-tax, anti-intellectual small shopkeepers’ hero, 					whose protectionist Union de Défense Commerçants et Artisans gained fifty-three 					seats in the 1955 elections. In the perfect economic system, to which Schueller 					devoted his intellectual energies for the last thirty years of his life, 					taxation would be related not to income but to energy use. As for democratic 					accountability, he regarded it with contempt. A self-proclaimed authoritarian, 					Schueller thought government should be run in the same way as an efficient 					company, by those who had proved their fitness to lead by rising to the top. 					When political power was at the mercy of the popular vote—just as when a company 					found itself at the mercy of the trade unions—weak, inefficient leadership would 					invariably result. Few of today’s public figures would actually utter such 					thoughts out loud. But one consequence of the affaire 						Bettencourt has been to show that many public figures actually 					conduct their lives upon such assumptions.

				Both the affaire 						Bettencourt and the affaire Banier from 					which it sprang are about money—specifically, the huge fortune belonging to 					Schueller’s daughter Liliane. But one can’t help noticing that the one person 					who doesn’t really figure in the drama is Liliane herself. She is simply a huge 					fountain of cash, which the various men in her life have tapped into in order to 					fulfill their desires. First there was her husband, André Bettencourt, whose 					political progress she financed and supported. Where did the cash come from, 					which stuffed those envelopes he kept ready, each election season, for the 					procession of political beggars? M. Bettencourt was a vice president of L’Oréal, 					but it was his wife who owned the company—and the money. Then there was 					François-Marie Banier, who befriended Liliane in 1987. Banier, a poor boy, 					dreamed of becoming rich; she fulfilled his dream. And now her financial 					adviser, Patrice de Maistre, appears to have his own ideas regarding her 					money.

				The striking thing about Madame Bettencourt is that 					she seems to accept that this is simply how the world works. It is agreed by all 					that she is, or was, “a brilliant woman.” Unlike other brilliant women, however, 					and despite all her apparent advantages, she never had a career of her own, but 					confined her role to furthering the careers of other people. The butler’s 					recordings show a pitiful puppet whose strings are pulled alternately by Banier 					and de Maistre. According to Bettencourt’s onetime nurse, emboldened by the 					recordings to testify, Banier uses his emotional thrall to get his hands on yet 					more of Madame Bettencourt’s money; de Maistre instructs her, word for word, on 					what she must say when she meets the important politicians who are his friends, 					and he makes out checks for her to sign, impatiently explaining how the benefits 					they will buy are cheap at the price. For his pains, he has received the Légion 					d’Honneur. But no conceivable benefit accrues to Liliane Bettencourt.

				Anyone who knows about Eugène Schueller and his 					ideas will recognize that this fate—to have all the money and none of the 					power—might have been precisely, albeit unintentionally, designed by the father 					Liliane idolized. Just as the Nazi scandal was a consequence of his politics, so 					the affaire Bettencourt is a consequence of his 					social theories. Schueller, as we have seen, had decided opinions on many 					subjects, among them the place of women in society. Women, in his view, were 					there to support men. They were for making homes and breeding children; they 					should never compete in the man’s world of work. This is the mold in which 					Liliane was cast, and she did not question it. First her widowed father’s 					dutiful daughter, then her husband’s supportive wife, she now, it seems, exists 					for the benefit of Banier, de Maistre, and their friends. It is for men to 					dictate the program. Liliane, true daughter of her father, merely facilitates 					it.

				It is deeply ironic that the source of all this 					money should be cosmetics, the same commodity that constituted Helena 					Rubinstein’s escape route from a similar situation. For Rubinstein and her 					clients, lipstick, powder, rouge, and the rest of the arsenal symbolized women’s 					claims to an equal footing in public life. In this sense, the affaire Bettencourt is simply another episode in the 					standoff between Helena Rubinstein and Eugène Schueller. More than half a 					century after their deaths, it continues.
