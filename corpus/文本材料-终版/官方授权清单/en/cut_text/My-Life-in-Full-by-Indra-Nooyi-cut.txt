foggy
tuesday

after
hour
of
meeting
in
washington
dc
with
two
dozen
top
us
and
indian

between
the
president
of
the
united
state
and
the
prime
minister
of
india
barack

and
manmohan

the
room
for

update
on
our
group
s
progress
and
president

the
american
team
to
his
indian
counterpart
when
he

indra
nooyi
ceo
of
pepsico
prime
minister
singh
exclaim
oh
but
she
be
one
of
us
and
the
president
with
a
big
smile
and
without
miss
a
beat
respond
ah
but
she
be
one
of
us
too
it
s
a
moment
i
never
forget
spontaneous
kindness
from
the
leader
of
the
two
great
country
that
have
give
me
so
much
i
be
still
the
girl
who
grow
up
in
a
close
family
in
madras
in
the
south
of
india
and
i
be
deeply
connect
to
the
lesson
and
culture
of
my
youth
i
be
also
the
woman
who
arrive
in
the
us
at
age
twenty
three
to
study
and
work
and
somehow
rise
to
lead
an
iconic
company
a
journey
that
i
believe
be
possible
only
in
america
i
belong
in
both
world
look
back
i
see
how
my
life
be
full
of
this
kind
of
duality
compete
force
that
have
push
and
pull
me
from
one
chapter
to
another
and
i
see
how
this
be
true
of
everyone
we
be
all
balance
juggling
compromise
do
our
best
to
find
our
place
move
ahead
and
manage
our
relationship
and
responsibility
it
s
not
easy
in
a
society
that
change
very
fast
yet
stick
to
some
age
old
habit
and
rule
of
behavior
that
feel
out
of
our
control
the
twin
demand
that
define
me
have
always
be
my
family
and
my
work
i
join
pepsico
in
in
part
because
the
company
s
headquarters
be
close
to
my
house
i
have
two
daughter
age
ten
and
one
and
a
half
at
the
time
and
a
husband
whose
office
be
nearby
pepsico
s
job
offer
make
sense
we
thought
because
the
commute
be
short
i
d
be
able
to
drive
to
the
school
or
home
to
the
baby
in
fifteen
minute
of
course
this
be
not
the
only
reason
i
chose
pepsico
an
exuberant
optimistic
company
that
i
wholeheartedly
enjoy
from
the
moment
i
walk
in
i
also
felt
that
pepsico
be
a
place
that
be
open
to
change
with
the
time
that
be
important
i
be
female
an
immigrant
and
a
person
of
color
enter
an
executive
floor
where
i
be
different
from
everyone
else
my
career
have
start
when
the
dynamic
between
woman
and
men
at
work
be
not
the
same
as
they
be
now
in
fourteen
year
as
a
consultant
and
corporate
strategist
i
have
never
have
a
woman
bos
i
have
no
female
mentor
i
wasn
t
upset
when
i
be
exclude
from
the
custom
of
male
power
i
be
just
happy
to
be
include
at
all
but
by
the
time
i
get
to
pepsico
wave
of
educate
ambitious
woman
be
pour
into
the
workforce
and
i
could
sense
the
atmosphere
change
the
competition
between
men
and
woman
be
become
more
acute
and
in
the
subsequent
decade
woman
have
alter
the
game
in
way
that
would
have
be
unthinkable
to
me
early
on
as
a
business
leader
i
always
try
to
anticipate
and
respond
to
the
shift
culture
as
a
woman
and
the
mother
of
girl
i
want
to
do
everything
possible
to
encourage
it
as
my
career
progress
and
my
child
grow
up
i
wrestle
with
the
ever
present
conflict
of
work
motherhood
for
fifteen
year
i
kept
a
whiteboard
in
my
office
that
only
my
daughter
could
write
on
or
erase
over
time
that
board
be
a
comfort
kaleidoscope
of
doodle
and
message
a
constant
reminder
of
the
people
closest
to
me
when
i
move
out
of
my
office
i
kept
a
canvas
replica
of
its
last
iteration
hey
mom
i
love
you
very
very
much
xoxoxox
hang
in
there
never
forget
that
you
have
people
that
love
you
have
a
great
day
hey
mom
you
be
the
absolute
best
keep
do
what
you
be
do
the
image
exclaims
with
cartoon
character
and
picture
of
sun
and
cloud
all
in
green
and
blue
dry
erase
marker
as
a
high
profile
female
ceo
i
be
ask
over
and
over
to
discus
work
and
family
conflict
in
front
of
large
audience
i
once
comment
that
i
wasn
t
sure
my
daughter
thought
i
be
a
good
mother
don
t
all
mom
feel
that
way
sometimes
and
an
indian
tv
network
produce
a
full
hour
prime
time
discussion
program
without
me
on
what
indra
nooyi
say
about
work
woman
over
the
year
i
met
thousand
of
people
worried
about
how
to
be
true
to
their
family
their
job
and
their
ambition
to
be
good
citizen
this
engagement
have
a
great
impact
on
me
i
learn
and
absorbed
the
detail
at
a
visceral
level
i
thought
about
how
family
be
such
a
powerful
source
of
human
strength
but
realize
that
create
and
nurture
family
be
a
source
of
stress
for
so
many
at
the
same
time
i
be
among
a
vaunt
group
of
global
ceo
regularly
invite
into
room
with
the
most
influential
leader
on
the
planet
and
i
come
to
notice
that
the
painful
story
about
how
people
especially
woman
struggle
to
blend
their
life
and
livelihood
be
entirely
absent
in
those
room
the
titan
of
industry
politics
and
economics
talk
about
advance
the
world
through
finance
technology
and
fly
to
mar
family
the
actual
messy
delightful
difficult
and
treasure
core
of
how
most
of
us
live
be
fringe
this
disconnect
have
profound
consequence
our
failure
to
address
work
and
family
pressure
in
the
senior
reach
of
global
decision
make
restrains
hundred
of
million
of
woman
every
day
not
only
from
rise
and
lead
but
also
from
blending
a
satisfy
career
with
a
healthy
partnership
and
motherhood
in
a
prosperous
marketplace
we
need
all
woman
to
have
the
choice
to
work
in
paid
job
outside
the
home
and
for
our
social
and
economic
infrastructure
to
entirely
support
that
choice
woman
s
financial
independence
and
security
so
central
to
their
equality
be
at
stake
more
broadly
ignore
the
fact
that
the
work
world
be
still
largely
skewed
toward
the
ideal
worker
of
yore
an
unencumbered
male
breadwinner
depletes
us
all
men
too
company
lose
out
because
productivity
innovation
and
profit
suffer
when
so
many
employee
feel
they
can
t
bring
their
whole
self
to
work
family
lose
out
because
they
spend
so
much
energy
cop
with
old
system
from
short
school
hour
to
a
lack
of
parental
leave
or
elder
care
that
don
t
mesh
with
their
reality
and
of
course
the
entire
global
community
suffers
many
young
people
worried
about
how
they
will
manage
it
all
be
choose
not
to
have
child
this
could
not
only
have
dire
economic
consequence
in
the
decade
to
come
but
on
a
very
personal
note
i
find
this
detail
sad
with
everything
i
have
accomplish
my
great
joy
be
have
child
and
i
wouldn
t
want
anyone
to
miss
the
experience
if
they
want
it
i
believe
that
we
must
address
the
work
and
family
conundrum
by
focus
on
our
infrastructure
around
care
with
an
energy
and
ingenuity
like
never
before
we
should
consider
this
a
moonshot
start
with
ensure
that
every
worker
have
access
to
paid
leave
flexibility
and
predictability
to
help
them
handle
the
ebb
and
flow
of
work
and
family
life
and
then
move
fast
to
develop
the
most
innovative
and
comprehensive
childcare
and
eldercare
solution
that
our
great
mind
can
devise
this
mission
will
require
leadership
that
we
don
t
often
see
i
think
the
fundamental
role
of
a
leader
be
to
look
for
way
to
shape
the
decade
ahead
not
just
react
to
the
present
and
to
help
others
accept
the
discomfort
of
disruption
to
the
status
quo
we
need
the
wisdom
of
business
leader
policy
maker
and
all
woman
and
men
passionate
about
ease
the
work
and
family
burden
to
come
together
here
with
a
can
do
sense
of
optimism
and
a
must
do
sense
of
responsibility
we
can
transform
our
society
transformation
be
difficult
but
i
have
learn
that
with
courage
and
persistence
and
the
inevitable
give
and
take
it
can
happen
when
i
become
pepsico
s
ceo
in
i
laid
out
an
extremely
ambitious
plan
to
address
the
underlie
tension
in
a
company
still
root
in
sell
soda
and
chip
i
knew
we
have
to
balance
support
our
prize
pepsi
cola
and
doritos
brand
with
a
full
throttle
effort
to
make
and
market
more
healthy
product
we
have
to
keep
stock
store
and
pantry
with
convenient
delicious
snack
and
beverage
but
account
for
the
environmental
impact
of
that
growth
we
have
to
attract
and
retain
the
very
best
thinker
in
their
field
but
ensure
that
pepsico
be
also
a
terrific
place
to
work
for
a
quarter
of
a
million
people
i
call
this
mission
performance
with
purpose
and
for
a
dozen
year
i
weigh
every
decision
against
these
measure
make
constant
trade
offs
to
achieve
a
more
sustainable
contemporary
organization
in
the
month
before
i
left
pepsico
in
i
thought
about
how
i
would
contribute
in
the
year
ahead
know
that
i
be
one
in
a
chain
of
woman
leader
who
can
help
move
us
forward
for
generation
to
come
i
set
out
to
write
a
book
and
insist
to
all
around
me
that
it
would
not
be
a
memoir
instead
i
thought
i
would
devote
every
ounce
of
my
experience
and
intellect
to
a
manual
for
fix
how
we
mix
work
and
family
the
book
you
hold
be
not
that
book
first
i
soon
found
that
the
research
on
work
and
family
have
be
do
from
every
angle
in
every
corner
of
the
world
the
argument
and
idea
for
support
family
from
maternity
leave
to
early
childhood
education
to
multigenerational
living
have
be
compile
analyze
score
and
debate
by
brilliant
mind
i
didn
t
need
to
repeat
all
that
second
everything
i
bring
to
this
issue
i
know
now
come
from
my
own
life
in
full
part
i

put

accept
the
adult

us
constantly
not
allow

to
finish

us
you
will
be
fine
our

common

push
me
to
learn
both
self
discipline
and
how
to
speak
up
i
get
the
courage
to
branch
out
and
prove
myself
because
i
be
raise
within
a
framework

run
around

judged
on
their

girl
be
allow
to
be
equally
ambitious
that
s
not
to
say
that
the
rule
be
just
the
same
there
be
certainly
a
sense
that
girl
be
to
be
protect
differently
than
boy
be
but
intellectually
and
in
term
of
opportunity

felt
held
back
by
my

this
come
from
the

fundamental
to
our
life
on
this

both
my

of
the

budget
on
us
and
then
buy
herself
something

and
dhoti
my

wash
our
knee
high

it
just
right
to
race
through
the
process
when
it
rain
we
iron
the
hell
out
of
those
clothes
to
avoid
have
to
wear
anything
wet
in
the
morning
if
the
power
go
out
which
happen
pretty
often
we
wore
slightly
damp
uniform

very
few
toy
my

we
call
house

doctor
with
crude
medical
equipment

we
craft
out
of

our
life
would
have
be
very
different
and
difficult
thatha
s
pension
be
small
and
my
mother
with
three
kid
have
no
mean
of
earn
money
none
of
my
aunt
and
uncle
could
have
afford
to
take
us
in
with
no
government
support
system
in
place
my
mother
may
have
add
more
tenant
in
the
big
house
but
would
have
run
full
speed
into
the
deep
seat
bias
against
the
woman
of
her
generation
who
almost
never
go
into
business
our
education
as
we
knew
it
would
probably
have
stop
family
as
powerful
as
it
be
can
also
be
so
fragile
every
family
run
the
risk
of
unexpected
hardship
and
without
adequate
safety
net
from
government
or
private
enterprise
episode
like
my
father
s
accident
can
ripple
through
people
s
life
for
decade
or
generation
most
significantly
this
event
make
real
my
father
s
urge
for
me
as
a
woman
to
always
have
the
mean
to
provide
for
myself


in
tenth
grade
a
new
girl
mary
bernard
transfer
into
holy
angel
and
we
become
fantastic
friend
mary
be
the
daughter
of
an
army
officer
and
she
be
funny
and
adventurous
more
important
she
own
a
shiny
new
acoustic
guitar
and
take
lesson
i
really
want
to
learn
to
play
the
guitar
too
but
amma
be
just
not
go
to
buy
me
one
she
be
adamant
and
a
little
horrify
good
south
indian
brahmin
girl
do
not
play
guitar
and
sing
english
rock
n
roll
song
she
insist
this
be
not
appropriate
i
should
focus
on
south
indian
classical
music
and
instrument
she
say
but
this
wasn
t
go
to
stop
me
and
in
a
lucky
break
mary
and
i
found
an
old
guitar
in
a
storage
cupboard
in
the
school
we
take
it
to
sister
nessan
who
unexpectedly
agree
to
refurbish
it
for
me
to
use
contrary
to
my
mother
s
attitude
i
think
she
be
a
contemporary
thinker
who
be
not
immune
to
the
beatles
and
be
probably
excite
by
the
prospect
of
a
new
genre
of
music
at
holy
angel
then
with
two
more

i
have
my
three
year
chemistry
degree
from

and
a
well
hone
sense
that
i
could
learn
anything
if
i
work
hard
enough
i
also
felt
i
simply
couldn
t
fail
and
bring
that
shame
to
my
family
it
would
be
a
tough
slog
but
i
have
to
figure
it
out
i
be
a
girl
of
just
eighteen
and
many
of
my
classmate
be
in
their
early
twenty
most
be
engineer
from
the
famous
indian

different
from
mine
middle

kid
mostly
from

and
have
be

to
excel
at

we
have
all
attend
elite
undergraduate
college
and
almost
no
one
have
work
experience
i
found
the
guy
cheerful
and
erudite
dress
in
jean
and
t
shirt
hang
out
together
play
guitar
or

deep
purple
played

drank
and
smoke
a
lot
of

which
seem
to
be
widely
available
iim
calcutta
be
very
ambitious
it
be
set
up
by
the
indian
government
in
with
the
help
of
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
mit
and
be
steep
in
high
level
math
and
statistic
i
have
grown
up
in
socialist
lean
india
but
the
country
be
keen
to
groom
the
next
generation
in
school
like
this
for
a
future
of
democracy
and
capitalism
the
subject
matter
at
iim
calcutta
be
classic
mba
a
two
year
program
with
require
course
in
the
first
and
elective
in
the
second
we
study
finance
marketing
operation
strategy
economics
team
dynamic
all
taught
with
a
huge
dollop
of

center
and
prepared
the
rout

for
a
complex
truck

the
faculty
be
renowned
in
their
field
and
be
terrific
teacher
too
they
built
a
great
rapport
with
the
student
one
mandatory
course
be
computer
board
wiring
i
d
never
use
a
computer
and
calcutta
have
just
two
system
mainframe
the
then
iconic
ibm
system
that
help
globalize
compute
we
d
get
a
three
by
three
foot
sheet
of
paper
with
dot
and
grid
and
have
to
solve
a
problem
first
create
a
flowchart
then
write
a
program
in
fortran
and
translate
it
into
a
wiring
diagram
for
a
computer
board
for
the
electrical
engineer
this
be
second
nature
for
me
it
be
grueling
our
solution
be
take
across
town
to
the
system
at
the
indian
statistical
institute
if
the
diagram
be
right
we
get
an
answer
if
it
be
wrong
no
credit
i
have
no
idea
why
that
course
be
useful
at
all
while
i
struggle
in
some
class
i
be
well
prepared
in
others
i
d
grown
up
in
a
swirl
of
conversation
and
learn
to
argue
philosophical
question
in
front
of
a
crowd
thatha
have
often
ask
me
to
read
him
the
newspaper
because
his
eye
be
tire
i
thought
i
be
help
him
out
but
he
have
usually
read
the
article
already
and
just
want
to
make
sure
i
learn
about
current
affair
as
a
teenager
in
madras
when
i
be
in
high
school
i
d
also
be
invite
to
three
more
important
student
conference
sponsor
by
the
indian
government
or
international
development
group
i
don
t
know
how
i
make
these
list
but
i
suspect
i
be
recommend
by
r
k
barathan
the
ceo
of
a
chemical
company
who
judged
our
student
debate
in

have
sometimes
pull
me
aside
and
give
me
tip
on
how
to
improve
my
performance
so
i
presume
he
saw
something
in
me

t

have
elevate

at

at

at

the
job
be
in
bombay
where
madras
be
quiet
and
calcutta
be

bombay
on
the
west
coast
be
the
heart
of
commercial
india
a
city
of
tall
building
and
shiny
apartment
open
late
crammed
with
worker
rush
through
the
street
i
watch
the
incredible
dabbawalas
men
in
white
hat
and
strip
outfit
rid
their
bicycle
or
on
train
and
bus
move
thousand
of
lunch
every
day
from
home
to
office
their
delivery
system
so
finely
tune
have
now
become
a
popular
case
study
on
logistics
management
in
business
school
around
the
world
i
rode
a
double
decker
bus
to
work
near
the
bustling
waterfront
and
the
gateway
of
india
monument
i
met
up
with
business
school
friend
at
midday
and
played
bridge
with
them
on
weekend
i
slept
on
a
sofa
in
my
aunt
lalitha
and
uncle
haran
s
apartment
in
sion
a
suburb
of
bombay
they
be
full
of
love
and
told
my
parent
they
would
be
responsible
for
me
and
set
a
firm
p
m
curfew
which
i
never
violate
i
be
team
up
with
a
student
from
iim
ahmedabad
to
look
at
the
construction
schedule
of
six
nuclear
power
plant
and
determine
which
would
be
complete
on
time
over
three
month
we
pore
over
list
of
hundred
of
equipment
and
engineering
service
for
each
plant
to
understand
the
delay
and
figure
out
new
schedule
it
be
an
exhaust
process
but
i
think
the
vendor
and
partner
give
us
an
honest
assessment
of
the
issue
they
be
up
against
the
picture
be
trouble
we
learn
that
some
developed
country
held
back
their
state
of
the
art
technology
from
emerge
market
to
extract
a
little
more
return
from
outdated
design
that
be
flaw
and
expensive
we
also
learn
that
large
government
project
could
be
pretty
inefficient
the
internship
left
me
with
a
sharper
focus
on
the
interdependence
of
business
and
society
and
convince
me
that
mba
student
could
play
a
constructive
role
in
help
government
but
it
didn
t
leave
me
encourage
about
the
motivation
of
wealthy
country
toward
emerge
market


one
even
in
mid
june
my
father
call
to
say
that
our

unable

it
be
a
picture
i
could
imagine
my
parent

care
for
him
in
the
men

only
my

calcutta
by
the
time
chandrika
and
i
be
in

my
parent
and
grandparent
saw
that
it
be
more
acceptable
for
woman
to
be
in
the
ring
with
men
they
would
not
have
question
us
have
we
want
to
get
married
and
settle
down
like
many
of
our
friend
but
they
didn
t
hold
us
back
from
want
to
do
more
in

they
encourage
it
we
be
lucky
not
to
have
our
ambition
dampen


educate
girl
remains
the
bedrock
of
advance
woman
in
our
world
although
poverty
violence
and
ancient
male
dominate
culture
still
stand
in
the
way
the
benefit
be
endless
educate
girl
and
woman
be
healthier
contribute
more
to
the
paid
economy
and
have
far
few
child
as
teenager
themselves
they
lead
in
their
community
in
the
develop
world
educate
girl
be
also
less
likely
to
be
married
off
as
teen
in
part
because
when
they
be
elevate
in
their
family
by
the
confidence
and
wisdom
that
come
with
education
they
be
more
value
but
educate
girl
and
woman
and
what
these
woman
do
once
they
get
their
degree
be
not
just
issue
in
the
develop
world
in
the
us
europe
and
india
where
university
and
community
college
be
packed
with
woman
get
the
most
degree
we

haven
t
smooth
the
path
to
get
the

and
brightest
into

difference
from
the
hour
at

at
the
time

johnson
johnson
have
already
introduce
carefree
a

a
step
up
the
first
disposable
maxi
pad
with
an
adhesive
strip
that
stuck
to
underwear
it
have
be
sell
in
the
us
for
almost
ten
year
and
promise
woman
a
new
kind
of
freedom
the
stayfree
team
in
india
have
a
lot
to
do
to
tweak
the
product
to
make
it
widely
acceptable
we
have
to
manufacture
the
pad
with
the
right
layer
of
absorbent
and
waterproof
material
suitable
for
the
indian
market
and
undergarment
worn
by
local

we
have
to
get
the
adhesive
rework
for
the
humidity
the
box
illustration
of
a
woman
with
long
hair
and
a
flow
pink
dress
wad
in
the
sea
have
to
be
precisely
color
match
with
the
global
package
we
conduct
extensive
research
ask
dozen
of
woman
in
the
office
and
their
acquaintance
to
use
a
pad
and
then
leave
it
in
the
bathroom
for
me
to
see
how
it
crumple
or
leak
the
request
be
awkward
but
many
of
the
woman
trust
us
enough
to
comply
i
want
those
pad
smooth
not
visible
through
clothes
i
felt
this
issue
have
purpose
and
that
the
product
could
make
woman
s
life
just
a
little
well
cloth
be
uncomfortable
this
be
some
form
of
liberation
my
boss
be
all
men
and
i
have
to
routinely
explain
my
research
and
progress
these
be
delicate
conversation
for
me
but
the
men
listen
intently
and
have
constructive
suggestion
they
knew
this
be
the
job
advertising
feminine
personal
product
be
taboo
in
india
at
that
time
we
could
only
talk
tangentially
about
the
experience
of
use
them
we
have
to
go
into
school
and
college
to
explain
the
benefit
to
young
woman
we
also
have
to
convince
parent
especially
mother
to
pay
for
this
freedom
for
their
daughter
which
wasn
t
always
easy
and
there
be
an
additional
issue
these
product
be
never
displayed
or
talk
about
in
a
store
they
be
kept
behind
the
counter
and
pass
to
customer
wrap
in
newspaper
to
ask
for
sanitary
napkin
a
woman
would
typically
wait
for
a
shop
to
clear
then
quietly
whisper
to
the
clerk
almost
always
a
man
that
she
want
something
personal
the
clerk
understood
but
sometimes
smile
in
a
way
that
make
her
uncomfortable
india
have
no
self
service
store
in
those
day
despite
all
these
hurdle
we
introduce
stayfree
in
two
test
market
in
less
than
seven
month
i
felt
like
my
effort
have
paid
off


while
i
be
busy
at
mettur
beardsell
and
johnson
johnson
many
of
my
friend
all
men
have
left
for
america
for
postgraduate
program
at
university
in
california
illinois
texas
and
minnesota
the
us
have
a
special
draw
for
young
people
and
be
view
as
a
seat
of
culture
and
innovation
we
listen
to
american
music
watch
american
movie
and
read
american
news
many
of
the
best
student
from
the
iits
chose
to
go
to
the
us
for
their
master

and
phd
degree
and
then
go
on
to
amaze
career
in
a
way
the
us
get
india
s
very
best
student
who
have
be
educate
in
elite
institution
subsidize
by
the
indian
government
this
be
a
tremendous
brain
drain
that
unfortunately
continue
even
today
it
s
surprising
to
me
that
the
indian
government
hasn
t
help
foster
more
of
an
entrepreneurial
ecosystem
to
incentivize
this
talent
to
remain
in
the
country
after
iim
i
felt
a
steady
drumbeat
from
these
friend
to
come
to
america
too
but
i
be
always
quick
to
think
that
i
have
no
real
reason
what
be
my
place
in
america


india
of
course
can
be
excruciatingly
hot
but
never
more
than
in
the
humid
summer
month
in
madras
as
teenager
chandrika
and
i
have
discover
that
the
library
at
the
british
and
us
consulate
have
consistently
good
air
conditioning
we
often
sought
refuge
there
and
love
their
full
collection
of
publication
from
abroad
magazine
newspaper
and
book
in
december
during
a
visit
to
madras
over
the
holiday
i
wander
the
mile
or
so
from
home
down
the
road
to
the
american
library
as
i
have
so
often
do
before
i
begin
to
browse
back
issue
of
magazine
and
there
in
a
september
issue
of
newsweek
with
jimmy
carter
and
gerald
ford
on
the
cover
i
read
an
article
title
a
shade
of
difference
about
yale
university
s
new
business
school
which
focus
on
public
and
private
management
that
article
be
speak
to
me
i
be
interested
in
a
life
in
global
business
but
felt
that
my
chance
of
go
to
the
us
for
a
job
be
very
low
i
have
be
think
that
a
degree
from
the
us
be
probably
the
best
way
to
move
ahead
but
i
be
reluctant
to
repeat
an
mba
the
various
course
i
d
attend
and
my
summer
internship
all
awaken
in
me
the
interdependence
of
the
public
and
private
sector
yale
seem
to
be
create
the
exact
blend
of
what
i
be
eager
to
learn
a
lot
more
about
over
the
next
few
month
i
sent
away
for
the
yale
application
and
take
the
gmat
i
told
my
parent
about
it
but
no
one
be
too
optimistic
when
i
receive
an
acceptance
letter
no
one
really
care
we
couldn
t
afford
it
then
a
few
week
later
another
letter
arrive
the
university
have
decide
to
offer
me
financial
aid
percent
of
the
cost
in
loan
percent
in
a
work
to
pay
program
and
the
rest
in
a
scholarship
suddenly
the
excitement
and
nervousness
in
the
family
be
palpable
the
idea
that
i
might
leave
india
be
become
real
my
father
be
abundantly
proud
my
mother
be
terrify
about
let
me
go
so
far
away
not
surprisingly
both
worried
about
how
i
would
repay
the
loan
convert
to
indian
rupee
my
debt
upon
graduation
would
be
much
large
than
my
father
s
annual
pay


one
even
in
may
norman
be
in
bombay
and
invite
me
to
dinner
he
told
me
the
mill
strike
be
over
and
ask
me
to
come
back
to
mettur
beardsell
this
time
to
run
the
whole
textile
division
this
be
a
major
promotion
i
couldn
t
believe
it
i
d
be
in
charge
of
almost
percent
of
the
company
i
told
norman
about
yale
and
then
ask
him
norman
do
you
really
think
i
should
give
up
this
yale
admission
and
come
back
to
work
for
you
and
he
reply
no
you
shouldn
t
i
m
disappointed
that
you
re
go
but
if
i
be
advise
you
as
my
daughter
i
d
say
go
this
i
think
be
true
mentorship
norman
be
approach
his
mandatory
retirement
age
in
india
and
he
must
have
thought
that
he
d
train
me
as
an
executive
for
a
couple
of
year
before
he
return
to
the
uk
but
he
also
didn
t
want
to
cap
my
progress
he
be
quick
to
support
a
different
road
for
me
he
be
unselfish
he
also
played
a
pivotal
role
in
convincing
my
parent
that
i
could
succeed
in
america
when
i
told
them
he
have
offer
me
a
big
new
position
at
mettur
beardsell
they
both
immediately
assume
i
d
take
it
and
come
back
to
madras
when
i
then
say
norman
thought
i
should
go
to
yale
instead
they
accepted
that
choice
for
me
too
they
trust
norman
i
realize
now
that
they
trust
me
as
well
as
i
prepared
to
leave
india
my
two
mettur
beardsell
boss
do
one
more
thing
that
still
astonishes
me
at
that
time

us
consulate
in
madras
approve
about
fifty
student
visa
application
to
the
us
a
day
and
reject
more
than
half
the
people
who
apply
i
be
nervous
about
face
james
e
todd
the
interview
officer
who
be
well
know
as
a
tough
questioner

on
there
be
about
sixty
people
already
in

at
p
m
all
nervously
clutch
folder
with
their
admission
document
and
uncertain
about
their
fate
i
be
the
only
woman
and
then
every
few
hour
norman
or
s
l
rao
show
up
with
food
and
encouragement

have
overheard
them
at
night

the
pro
and
con
of

and
i
think

the
one
who
finally
persuade
my
mother
to
just
let
me
spread
my
wing

can
imagine
the
overwhelm
sadness

must
have
felt
to
see
their
daughter
go
to
a
distant
land
although
they
be
nothing
but
cheerful
and
encourage

that
day

in
every
way
i
be
a
complete
novice
i
start
to

i
now
know
that
many
immigrant
american
dream
begin
with
fear
awe
and
loneliness
i
believe
in
the
american
story
because
it
be
my
story
as
a
ceo

once
sat
in
the
eighteenth
century
wood
panel
din
room
at
chequer

fact
that
i
be
in
that
dorm
room
in
new
england
in
the
s
be
a
testament
to
my
family
in
southern
india
the
focus
since
my
birth
on
my
education
my
grandfather
s

parent
faith
in

their
courage
to
defy
century
of
cultural
and
social
pressure
to
let
their
daughter
fly

be
a
testament
to
the
nun
in
my
convent
school

my
indian
schoolmate
who
encourage
me
and
to

signal
that
woman
could
reach
any
height

also
a
sign
of
the
time

advance
in
technology

and
communication
have

and
other

and
i
knew
it
meant
i
have
to
work

professional
life
and
to

in
india

in
the
us
instead
i

a
few
buck
on
a
loaf
of
white
bread
a
tomato
and
a
bag
of
potato
chip
i
squish
the
tomato
onto
the
bread
and

thing
be
to
get
you

with
red
chili
flake
we
venture
out
to

enjoy
it
it
will
get
well
every
day
he
say
for
a
month
or
so
as
a

humble
i
realize
that
i
have
a

others
finish
to
watch
my
body
language

to
include
everyone
in

have
to
speak
clearly

deliberately
and
remain
pithy
with
my
interjection
after
the
first
feedback
session
i
be
a
little
disillusion

simple

in

really
believe
in

afraid

be
fully
prepared
for

during

the

would
meet
with

hear

to
listen
to
student
input
on
quality
of
life
at

difference
from
the
top
down
approach
in

i
be
careful

d
go
to
a
local
tailor
with
a

he
d
sewn
me
a
couple
of
shirt
and
top

i
thought
reflect
current
american
style

ugly

the
snowy

notwithstanding
the

and
alexander

which
i
be
proud

a
cricketer
miss
my
bat
and
ball
sport
and
knew
nothing
about
american
baseball
but
i
be
delighted
one
even
when
a
few
guy
ask
me
to
sit
with
them
and
taught
me
the
rule
i
start
reading
everything
i
could
about
reggie
jackson

and
be
over
the
moon
when
the
yankee
won
the
series
again
i
cry
when
the
captain
and
catcher
thurman
munson
die
in
a
plane
crash
in
the
summer
of
this
be
the
time
i
learn
that
the
language
of
sport
and
the
detail
of
particular
game
and
player
be
relevant
in
business
when
student
come
together
in
the
morning
they
talk
sport
in
interview
employer
talk
sport
if
you
weren
t
current
on
baseball
or
football
you
didn
t
fit
in
this
notion
seem
connect
with
wisdom
i
d
receive
from
my
parent
when
i
left
india
a
few
month
earlier
be
yourself
but
try
to
blend
in
too


shortly
after
our
winter
break
the
race
be
on
to
land
a
summer
job
i
need
a
paycheck
and
i
be
a
good
student
my
professor
be
ready
to
give
me
great
reference
they
view
me
as
hardworking
and
easy
to
work
with
they
felt
i
have
a
unique
global
perspective
on
issue
that
be
sorely
need
in
corporate
america
company
be
come
to
yale
and
i
have
to
impress
them
my
only
worry
be
that
i
have
no
business
suit
i
head
back
to
kresge
s
with
fifty
dollar
my
entire
saving
at
the
time
and
picked
out
a
dark
blue
polyester
outfit
a
two
button
jacket
and
match
slack
i
add
a
turquoise
polyester
blouse
with
light
blue
and
dark
blue
vertical
stripe
i
go
to
try
these
on
but
have
never
be
in
a
fitting
room
before
and
be
uncomfortable
about
undress
behind
a
drape
l
someone
peek
in
so
i
held
the
piece
up
in
front
of
the
mirror
the
slack
be
ok
the
jacket
seem
a
little
oversized
but
i
remember
my
mother
s
advice
to
buy
clothes
a
couple
of
size
too
big
because
i
d
grow
into
it
i
be
twenty
four
year
old
but
just
then
forgot
i
be
fully
grown
i
bought
it
all
proud
of
handle
this
big
purchase
and
i
use
all
of
my
money
this
be
the
single
big
expenditure
in
my
life
thus
far
leave
kresge
s
i
notice
the
shoe
department
but
i
have
nothing
to
spend
on
shoe
never
mind
i
thought
my
orange
suede
loafer
with
the
chunky
plastic
base
which
i
d
be
wear
all
winter
would
do
fine
i
could
tuck
my
foot
under
the
table
no
one
would
notice
on
interview
day
i
put
on
the
suit
the
blouse
fit
nicely
but
the
slack
be
a
lot
shorter
than
i
have
realize
the
jacket
hung
awkwardly
on
me
but
that
s
what
i
have
and
i
be
stuck
it
be
too
late
to
exchange
the
clothes
for
different
size
i
head
to
the
som
administration
building
where
everyone
be
gathering
in
the
career
office
to
meet
prospective
employer
there
be
my
schoolmate
pristine
in
their
well
fit
brook
brother
suit
the
woman
with
silk
shirt
and
elegant
wool
skirt
and
blazer
i
heard
a
collective
gasp
everyone
be
look
at
me
i
pretend
not
to
care
i
met
that
day
with
insilco
a
connecticut
base
conglomerate
that
manage
brand
in
prefabricate
housing
and
office
supply
among
other
business
the
interview
go
fine
but
i
left
the
room
completely
embarrass
and
defeat
i
ran
down
the
hall
to
the
director
of
career
development
jane
morrison
i
sat
down
on
her
sofa
and
burst
into
tear
look
at
me
i
say
i
go
to
the
interview
like
this
everyone
be
laugh
at
me
jane
be
very
matter
of
fact
yup
it
s
pretty
bad
she
say
pretty
bad
i
told
jane
about
my
financial
predicament
and
how
i
bought
a
suit
to
fit
my
budget
i
want
to
fit
in
i
explain
then
she
ask
me
what
i
d
wear
to
an
interview
in
india
a
sari
i
told
her
i
have
many
of
them
back
in
my
room
her
advice
next
time
wear
the
sari
and
if
they
won
t
hire
you
for
who
you
be
it
s
their
loss
just
be
yourself
insilco
make
two
offer
that
even
one
be
to
me
it
dawn
on
me
that
i
be
in
a
new
environment
and
that
this
might
be
a
living
example
of
the
american
promise
of
meritocracy
it
be
clear
that
insilco
picked
me
because
of
what
i
say
and
what
i
could
contribute
and
look
past
the
horrendous
outfit
i
wore
i
have
three
week
to
accept
the
offer
my
next
interview
be
schedule
with
booz
allen
hamilton
the
consult
firm
consult
be
consider
aspirational
the
hour
and
travel
be
brutal
but
the
job
paid
well
and
the
conventional
wisdom
be
that
the
experience
offer
a
three
to
five
year
head
start
versus
a
regular
corporate
career
this
meeting
be
too
good
to
pas
up
even
with
an
offer
in
my
pocket
i
decide
to
carry
on
with
it
i
wore
my
favorite
turquoise
silk
sari
with
cream
flower
and
a
turquoise
blouse
and
i
met
with
a
booz
allen
partner
from
texas
who
put
me
at
ease
right
away
he
conduct
a
rigorous
interview
use
a
business
case
and
i
felt
he
be
judging
my
ability
not
worry
one
bit
about
what
i
wore
or
look
like
booz
allen
hire
me
for
a
summer
job
in
chicago
with
intern
from
harvard
stanford
northwestern
and
the
university
of
chicago
i
join
a
team
develop
strategy
for
an
indiana
base
company
that
make
food
ingredient
a
wonderful
group
of
men
who
include
me
in
all
discussion
and
deliberation
coached
me
and
fully
support
me
i
wore
a
sari
to
work
every
day
but
never
visit
the
client
take
me
to
a
client
meeting
in
indianapolis
in
a
sari
would
have
be
too
jarring
in
those
day
at
the
time
i
fully
understood
and
accepted
my
colleague
leave
me
behind
it
seem
a
small
price
to
pay
i
be
thrill
to
be
on
my
way
as
a
work
woman
in
america


work
it
s
not
really
optional
and
that
s
good
because
the
benefit
of
paid
work
hardly
need
review
human
thrive
when
they
be
challenged
they
be
proud
when
they
ve
do
a
job
well
and
gain
from
be
with
people
who
share
the
same
goal
and
we
all
need
money
to
live
i
believe
that
woman
s
choice
to
work
outside
the
home
be
integral
to
their
well
be
and
their
family
s
prosperity
somehow
some
people
in
even
the
most
sophisticated
society
have
continued
to
question
whether
woman
should
engage
in
paid
work
at
all
this
perspective
seem
connect
to
the
idea
that
child
suffer
if
a
job
distracts
their
mother
from
care
for
them
in
some
place
it
s
just
easy
for
the
whole
society
to
stick
with
the
outdated
habit
they
know
i
don
t
see
it
this
way
in
fact
work
woman
s
kid
tend
to
do
well
in
school
be
more
independent
and
see
their
mother
as
valuable
role
model
besides
we
have
clear
proof
that
woman
s
paid
labor
force
participation
be
crucial
to
the
whole
economy
more
woman
in
the
workforce
make
us
all
more
prosperous
cut
poverty
boost
wage
and
swell
gross
domestic
product
but
for
me
the
reason
woman
need
a
clear
path
to
paid
work
be
more
direct
we
all
deserve
the
power
of
the
purse
for
our
own
freedom
the
full
acceptance
of
woman
as
paid
worker
spell
human
progress
it
unlocks
them
from
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
male
dominate
world


i
be
happy
to
have

of
the
objection
melt
away
when
raj
later
insist
that
he
be
go
to
marry
me
whatever
they
thought
of
the
situation
his
relative
be
then
quick
to
see
how
we
complement
each
other
and
embrace
me
wholeheartedly
meanwhile
i
told
my
parent
over
the

that
i

raj
nooyi
and
give
them
a
few
detail
they
be
understandably
scar
and
worried
because
they
hadn
t
met
him
or
vet
his
family
but
they
also
realize
they
have
no
choice
again
they
trust
my
judgment
and
acquiesce
a
month
later

raj
my

thought
my
new

wonderful
and
conclude
that

we
must
be
compatible
too

of

we

and
to
see
the
white

when
the

we
also
once
bundle
up
in
thermal
underwear
and
our
thickest
sweater
and
coat
to
sit
in
the

at
soldier
field
for
a
chicago
bear
football
game
the
number
of

really
didn
t
matter
the
vicious
wind
off
lake
michigan
that
swirl
around
the
stadium
have
us
frozen
in
minute
raj
be
a
big
dallas
cowboy
fan
after
his
time
in
texas
and
i
have
to
learn
the
rule
of
american
football
fast
to
enjoy
the
game
with
him
on
the
weekend


after
a
year
or
so
we
decide
we
should
buy
a
house
we
picked
a
lovely
tudor
style
three
bedroom
in
the
village
of
glen
ellyn
it
be
a
new
block
and
the
grass
be
barely
plant
the
tree
be
mere
twig
the
house
cost
with
a
minimum
percent
down
payment
we
have
save
and
raj
s
uncle
lent
us
even
then
we
have
to
buy
mortgage
insurance
because
we
d
contribute
so
little
the
interest
rate
be
percent
the
number
do
not
scream
that
this
be
a
good
deal
but
it
seem
to
us
that
the
american
dream
meant
we
should
buy
a
house
and
that
we
d
be
save
money
for
the
future
because
the
value
of
the
house
would
go
up
we
move
in
but
have
no
money
for
much
else
so
the
breakfast
area
family
room
and
master
bedroom
be
the
only
room
that
be
furnish
the
rest
of
the
house
remain
empty
we
do
buy
a
toro
lawn
mower
at
the
local
hardware
store
right
away
we
felt
very
american
my
parent
have
return
to
madras
right
after
our
wedding
and
my
dad
told
me
he
be
eager
to
come
back
to
explore
the
us
with
his

one
day
i
miss
them
a
lot
but
make
an
international
call
to
india
be
expensive
especially
during
the
day
so
once
a
week
after
p
m
i
d
talk
for
half
an
hour
with
my
parent

to
new
haven
in
august
as
part
of
the
yale
class
of

and
my
plan
to
save
for
the
future
be
shelve
for
the
moment

a
shadow
of
himself
and
suffer
yet
he
kept
reassure
us
not
to
worry
the
sight
of
my
sick
father
take
me
back
to

after

that
the
outlook
be
grim
and
then
in
the
single
most
valuable
corporate
benefit
i
receive
in
my
early
career
the
head
of
bcg
s
chicago
office
carl
stern
call
to
tell
me
to
take
up
to
six
month
off

my

a
friendly
wise
manager
who
have
recently
move

knew
the
toll
of
consult

and
go
out
of

generous
act
carl
both

financial
trouble

unsettled
until
he

it
be
also
important
that

how
paid
leave
to
get
through
all
kind
of
personal
situation
include
childbirth
and
personal
illness
but
also
other
circumstance
can
be
a
game
changer
for
so
many
career
in
many
way
it
s
only
when
you
have
experienced
this
benefit
yourself
that
you
can
truly
realize
its
critical
importance


after
my
dad
s
cancer
surgery
chandrika
and
nandu
return
to
the
us

still
walk
with

commute
by
car
every
morning
from
our
downtown
chicago
home
to
motorola
about
thirty
mile
away
a
few
week
later
my
mother
told
us
that
she
just
didn
t
want
to
face
another
chicago
winter
with
month
of
frigid
wind
and
below
freeze
temperature
the
gently
fall
snow
could
be
beautiful
she
say
but
she
be
feel
cooped
up
and
really
want
to
return
to
india
for
several
month
raj
and
i
fully
understood
we
bought
her
the
plane
ticket
preetha
wasn
t
happy
about
it
and
then
we
have
no
childcare
while
amma
live
with
us
through
my
pregnancy
as
we
adjust
to
parenthood
and
as
i
recover
from
the
terrible
car
accident
i
have
never
once
worried
about
preetha
be
safe
and
love
i
didn
t
worry
about
her
food
or
clothing
or
whether
she
be
be
truly
care
for
she
be
read
to
talk
to
picked
up
encourage
and
sign
up
for
baby
class
i
be
always
in
touch
with
my
mother
and
knew
the
detail
of
their
day
our
daughter
live
in
the
center
of
a
full
devote
community
but
now
for
one
cold
dark
season
at
least
raj
and
i
be
on
our
own
and
the
next
five
month
drove
home
how
difficult
it
be
for
two
work
parent
with
young
child
to
cope
in
an
environment
where
quality
affordable
childcare
be
not
ubiquitous
and
where
support
system
for
work
family
be
completely
lack
first
we
put
the
word
out
to
relative
friend
and
neighbor
that
we
be
look
for
a
caregiver
and
interviewed
a
few
people
like
so
many
other
parent
though
we
didn
t
meet
someone
we
trust
and
connect
with
and
the
whole
prospect
of
a
high
end
well
train
nanny
be
very
expensive
then
thankfully
a
woman
name
vasantha
whom
we
d
met
a
few
time
at
indian
music
concert
offer
to
help
she
live
with
her
husband
three
daughter
and
one
son
all
teenager
in
a
house
in
oak
park
illinois
about
twenty
minute
from
our
apartment
and
on
the
route
to
raj
s
office
she
would
take
preetha
every
morning
she
say
and
either
of
us
could
get
her
on
our
way
home
one
absolute
blessing
of
this
arrangement
i
know
in
retrospect
be
that
vasantha
let
us
pick
up
the
baby
any
time
in
the
even
so
every
morning
at
we
dress
preetha
in
her
full
body
snowsuit
hat
mitten
and
boot
and
packed
her
bag
of
diaper
extra
clothes
toy
cream
and
little
snack
then
raj
carry
her
by
a
m
down
the
street
to
his
car
through
the
chicago
winter
he
buckle
her
into
her
car
seat
and
drove
her
to
oak
park
in
the
evening
it
be
often
raj
who
go
back
to
vasantha
s
house
make
his
way
through
the
snowbank
to
the
front
door
i
be
less
available
to
pick
preetha
up
because
in
my
first
year
at
motorola
i
have
to
travel
to
phoenix
fairly
often
to
work
with
the
chicago
base
executive
who
have
their
winter
head
office
in
arizona
i
remember
a
few
episode
when
i
be
stuck
in
a
plane
on
the
tarmac
at
o
hare
airport
panicked
that
i
be
late
on
my
night
to
get
my
little
daughter
sometimes
i
didn
t
make
it
to
vasantha
s
house
until
or
p
m
preetha
love
vasantha
but
the
early
morning
drive
in
the
cold
and
the
late
night
pickup
wore
on
her
some
morning
she
just
refuse
to
leave
the
house
and
threw
tantrum
that
winter
be
not
our
most
shin
moment
by
spring
raj
and
i
be
exhaust
with
it
all
something
have
to
change
we
chose
to
move
back
to
glen
ellyn
into
a
four
bedroom
house
with
a
semifinished
basement
a
front
porch
and
a
double
garage
near
a
park
and
a
montessori
school
the
new
house
in
a
brand
new
development
be
much
closer
to
my
office
and
have
space
for
live
in
help
in
addition
to
visit
family
our
suburban
american
life
begin
for
a
second
time
now
with
furniture
in
almost
every
room
and
a
lively
three
year
old
girl
she
love
to
explore
the
nook
and
corner
and
many
stair
in
the
house
and
to
splash
in
the
bathtub
she
have
a
couple
of
friend
across
the
street
mark
and
david
and
they
watch
a
lot
of
teenage
mutant
ninja
turtle
on
tv
i
never
really
understood
this
show
but
raphael
donatello
michelangelo
and
leonardo
the
four
main
character
become
my
new
best
friend
raj
and
i
also
ask
our
parent
uncle
and
aunt
in
india
whether
any
of
them
could
take
time
off
and
come
to
the
us
to
help
us
with
preetha
some
agree
and
then
we
have
to
schedule
them
we
use
a
large
full
year
calendar
and
work
month
ahead
to
sort
out
all
the
travel
time
and
ticket
as
well
as
the
visa
and
support
document
everyone
need
to
get
into
the
us
and
then
go
back


for
the
next
few
year
my
mother
in
law
and
relative
alternate
living
with
us
occasionally
we
also
hire
a
local
babysitter
to
help
get
preetha
ready
for
her
preschool
class
assist
in
cooking
and
do
some
housework
in
the
evening
raj
and
i
take
over
we
still
didn
t
have
a
social
life
our
neighbor
be
friendly
but
hustle
to
keep
their
work
and
family
life
on
track
too
the
indian
relative
each
come
for
two
or
three
month
they
slept
in
a
bright
bedroom
with
an
attach
bathroom
on
the
main
floor
and
chipped
in
for
preetha
s
need
and
activity
frankly
they
watch
a
lot
of
tv
and
didn
t
go
anywhere
except
on
weekend
when
we
show
them
around
chicago
or
drove
them
to
the
mall
or
the
movie
they
struggle
a
bit
in
the
quiet
of
suburbia
miss
guest
pop
in
and
the
bustle
of
home
we
bought
them
each
a
visit
usa
airline
ticket
a
deal
for
foreign
visitor
to
fly
around
the
country
and
see
the
sight
but
no
one
use
it
they
come
to
glen
ellyn
just
to
be
with
us
the
men
have
decent
midlevel
job
in
government
in
india
and
have
never
take
much
vacation
so
they
have
paid
time
off
to
make
the
trip
their
wife
hadn
t
work
outside
their
home
and
didn
t
have
many
commitment
of
their
own
help
our
grow
family
be
view
both
as
an
intergenerational
responsibility
and
a
joy
they
felt
vested
in
our
success
crucially
for
me
they
reject
the
traditional
indian
notion
that
the
woman
in
the
family
even
if
she
earn
money
outside
the
house
be
also
responsible
for
keep
everyone
fed
clothed
clean
and
content
if
i
come
home
from
work
tire
they
d
tell
me
to
rest
i
have
stuck
with
my
job
as
raj
s
father
urge
me
to
do
after
our
wedding
and
they
be
very
proud
of
me
i
be
an
educate
energetic
woman
make
track
in
american
business
and
they
talk
about
my
career
with
their
friend
and
acquaintance
in
india
nooyi
be
a
small
village
near
mangalore
and
my
in
law
love
that
i
carry
the
name
in
my
pursuit
in
the
us
and
put
their
tiny
town
on
the
map
we
didn
t
pay
the
visit
relative
or
my
mother
for
their
help
raj
and
i
paid
for
everything
in
my
mother
s
life
when
she
live
with
us
but
didn
t
give
her
a
salary
for
the
childcare
cooking
cleaning
and
thousand
of
other
small
task
she
do
to
keep
our
household
go
over
the
year
have
we
suggest
we
pay
her
she
would
have
be
insult


even
though
raj
and
i
juggled
worried
bicker
and
coped
during
the
one
winter
when
we
drove
preetha
to
the
in
home
childcare
i
know
our
problem
be
pretty
simple
the
arrangement
be
short
live
and
we
have
secure
job
and
a
healthy
child
otherwise
when
our
child
be
small
raj
and
i
be
very
fortunate
to
be
able
to
rely
on
a
care
ecosystem
make
up
of
extend
family
support
by
household
help
to
let
our
own
little
family
flourish
and
of
course
we
could
keep
advance
in
our
career
but
what
of
the
million
of
family
who
don
t
have
this
luxury
the
travail
of
work
parent
who
do
this
dance
every
day
for
year
through
snowstorm
but
also
through
job
loss
divorce
illness
and
the
million
of
other
hurdle
we
all
face
make
me
wonder
why
accessible
affordable
quality
childcare
isn
t
a
national
priority


the
trust
care
i
have
at
home
let
me
dive
into
my
job
at
motorola
in
my
first
week
i
sat
down
in
my
new
office
in
the
old
automotive
electronics
building
to
read
about
the
recent
strategy
work
and
i
soon
figure
out
that
gerhard
have
burn
through
three
or
four
chief
strategist
in
the
eighteen
month
before
me
not
a
good
sign
i
ask
the
head
of
hr
about
it
yeah
that
s
because
gerhard
be
impossible
to
work
with
he
say
he
have
an
idea
a
minute
and
no
one
can
keep
up
with
him
we
re
hop
you
ll
last
this
be
essential
knowledge
gerhard
need
me
to
run
fast
with
him
and
to
help
push
his
vision
within
the
organization
he
start
stop
by
my
office
every
morning
with
new
musing
and
i
start
put
each
into
one
of
three
bucket
worth
work
on
right
away
fine
to
take
a
few
week
to
get
to
it
not
worth
pursue
over
time
i
reorder
the
list
and
he
saw
progress
he
never
question
my
judgment
on
how
and
why
i
have
prioritize
his
idea
gerhard
hire
me
a
total
outsider
because
i
have
be
expose
to
so
many
different
industry
and
could
apply
a
strategic
framework
to
understand
what
drive
value
in
a
business
i
be
outspoken
and
willing
to
challenge
the
status
quo
still
i
knew
nothing
about
car
and
electronics
so
i
have
two
community
college
professor
come
twice
a
week
to
my
office
for
lesson
one
on
how
automobile
work
and
the
other
on
solid
state
physic
and
electronics
what
be
a
microprocessor
what
be
a
semiconductor
what
be
electronic
engine
control
what
be
a
transmission
what
be
a
carburetor
without
this
extra
training
i
couldn
t
have
succeed
i
have
to
establish
myself
as
a
curious
and
quick
study
who
understood
motorola
s
whole
portfolio
especially
automotive
electronics
the

of
the
future
and
home
of
the
future
we
be
to
examine
how
people
could

to

company
in
silicon
valley
as
a
leader
i
could

make
sure
we
make
all
the
right
decision
in
some
meeting
i
would
comment
on
plan
directly
and
sometimes
point
out
why
i
thought
a
unit
s
strategy
wouldn
t
work
your
strategy
make
no
sense
i
d
say
there
s
no
way
you
can
deliver
the
return
you
have
assume
in
your
financial
model

at
some
point

to
take
a
different
tack
by
say
for
example
help
me
understand
how
this
come
together
as
i
see
it
this
technology
platform
require
a
lot
of
investment
and
patience
be
it
prudent
to
factor
in
a
quick
return
much
as
i
hat
this
new
softer
way
of
ask

to
me
he
reach
out
to
raj
about
the
connecticut
plan
and
mapped
out
all
the
reason
why
we
should
move
proximity
to
new

and
my
sister
well
school
lovely
home
more

and
an
action
orient
bos
and
company
he
be
quite
the
salesman
raj
take
the
call
and
listen
patiently
a
real
tribute
to
the
prince
of
a
man
he
be
one
night
raj
ask
me
if
i
thought
anything
be
go
to
happen
with
my
motorola
portfolio
analysis
i
told
him
it
didn
t
look
good
the
problem
lay
in
the
structure
of
motorola
s
leadership
the
president
of
each
division
ultimately
have
far
more
sway
than
i
do
over
these
decision
and
the
ceo
s
office
have
to
build
consensus
with
them
for
major
strategy
decision
my
department
be
always
go
to
be
a
sound
board
but
our
recommendation
might
take
year
to
implement
how
fresh
would
they
be
in
the
fast
move
tech
world
ok
raj
say
then
let
s
move
i
want
you
to
be
happy
and
it
s
clear
you
be
not
that
my
husband
place
my
happiness
and
career
at
the
center
of
this
discussion
be
touch
indeed
he
have
clearly
thought
it
through
and
he
be
willing
to
have
his
wife
and
daughter
move
across
the
country
while
he
stayed
in
chicago
and
follow
us
later
god
know
when
he
knew
he
d
have
to
switch
job
in
hp
or
move
to
another
company
he
be
willing
to
make
sure
that
i
be
fulfil
raj
s
selflessness
be
all
the
more
remarkable
because
he
be
take
on
the
convention
of
the
time
in
so
many
way
he
be
an
ambitious
educate
man
in
his
thirty
on
his
own
corporate
climb
with
great
financial
and
management
prospect
he
be
also
an
indian
immigrant
in
the
us
bound
by
both
the
behavioral
expectation
of
his
family
and
friend
back
home
and
by
the
men
he
be
get
to
know
in
this
new
country
with
this
choice
to
change
his
life
for
the
sake
of
my
career
he
be
contest
all
of
that
his
courage
and
devotion
to
me
and
to
his
family
be
why
i
adore
him
and
view
him
as
the
best
thing
that
ever
happen
to
me
when
i
decide
to
quit
motorola
chris
whose
grandfather

found
the

visibly
upset
he
come
to
our
house
one
weekend
morning
to
convince
me
to
stay
his
most
compelling
argument
be
that
i
shouldn
t
leave
an
institution
motorola
for
an
individual
gerhard
i
told
him
i
didn
t
want
to
leave
but
i
didn
t
feel
like
i
be
have
an
impact
all
i
want
be
to
see
the
result
of
my
work

my
mother
preetha
and
i
uprooted
to
a
small
two
bedroom
rental
apartment
on

connecticut
in
late
the
building
be
a
gigantic
cement
block
the
wall
be
thin
the
carpet
be
worn
and
preetha
now
age
six
have
nowhere
to
run
around
at
least
it
be
temporary
the
plan
be
for
raj
to
commute
from
chicago
a
couple
of
weekend
a
month
while
he
work
with

on
a
transfer
to
the
northeast
he
be
a
top
performer
and
set
for
a
promotion
and
he
love
the
work
he
be
optimistic
but
sadly
after
a
few
month
we
learn
that
the
big
job
in
connecticut
wasn
t
go
to
be
available
for
more
than
a
year
while
raj
be
ok
with
continue
to
travel
back
and
forth
i
didn
t
want
him
away
from
us
for
such
long
period
preetha
miss
him
and
i
didn
t
think
i
could
cope
without
him
raj
reluctantly
chose
to
move
to
connecticut
unclear
about
what
he
be
go
to
do
next
it
be
a
difficult
choice
and
a
sacrifice
that
he
make
out
of
love
he
quit
a
great
job
in
a
dominant
company
in
the

a
big
day
for

i
be
thrill
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
us
but
i
be
give
up
my
citizenship
of
india
the
country
where
i
be
born
and
a
place
so
central
to
my
identity
it
be
very
emotional


while
i
be
very
busy
in
my
strategy
job
i
be
also
a
critical
extra
set
of
eye
and
ear
for
gerhard
he
be
often
at
headquarters
in
zurich
because
he
be
a
member
of
the
abb
vorstand
the
executive
board
i
become
his
intermediary
in
the
us
passing
message
to
and
from
the
manager
try
to
make
his
big
idea
work
we
talk
several
time
a
day
gerhard
communicate
in
english
but
his
style
be
german
he
like
simple
framework
data
neatly
and
logically
present
and
pithy
presentation
sometimes
he
d
sit
through
a
meeting
and
then
turn
to
me
in
front
of
everyone
and
say
i
take
it
you
didn
t
review
this
material
before
it
come
to
me
i
could
sense
when
this
be
go
to
happen
because
his
ear
would
turn
red
i
be
the
only
one
who
notice
that
sort
of
comment
result
in
most
of
my
colleague
run
work
by
me
before
it
go
to
gerhard
they
appreciate
my
input
and
it
be
another
way
for
me
to
learn
about
issue
for
which
i
be
not
directly
responsible
i
have
to
use
the
power
of
my
access
carefully
i
make
sure
people
knew
i
be
not
speak
for
gerhard
and
that
gerhard
knew
that
i
didn
t
intend
to
carry
tale
there
be
a
downside
to
this
role
however
chris
galvin
at
motorola
be
right
my
loyalty
to
gerhard
be
complete
but
i
be
really
work
for
the
individual
not
the
institution
my
success
and
longevity
in
abb
be
tie
to
gerhard


strawberry
hill
be
not
to
our
like
and
after
a
few
month
i
start
look
for
a
house
to
rent
while
we
save
extra
money
to
buy
a
permanent
home
raj
and
i
carefully
thought
through
this
next
step
we
d
rent
in
a
location
close
to
where
we
want
to
buy
a
house
then
put
down
root
there
we
chose
connecticut
s
fairfield
county
which
be
largely
a
bedroom
community
line
with
metro
north
train
station
for
the
hundred
of
thousand
of
worker
who
travel
in
and
out
of
new
york
city
every
day
the
county
extends
thirty
mile
up
the
atlantic
coast
from
greenwich
on
the
new
york
state
line
with
big
house
on
wind
verdant
road
to
bridgeport
which
in
be
teeter
on
the
edge
of
bankruptcy
in
between
be
the
small
community
of
darien
new
canaan
norwalk
fairfield
westport
and
a
half
dozen
more
town
that
epitomize
new
england
suburban
life
good
school
public
library
old
church
and
pumpkin
on
the
doorstep
in
the
fall
when
i
didn
t
find
a
rental
after
a
couple
of
outing
gerhard
have
a
suggestion
helga
and
their
child
be
move
from
chicago
but
wouldn
t
arrive
for
a
few
week
gerhard
and
helga
have
line
up
a
temporary
house
in
new
canaan
why
didn
t
raj
and
i
take
that
house
the
schulmeyers
would
then
find
another
one
the
place
gerhard
and
helga
have
rent
be
gorgeous
big
than
we
might
have
chosen
with
mature
tree
and
a
lovely
yard
ok
raj
and
i
thought
when
we
saw
it
it
will
cost
a
little
more
but
let
s
do
it
but
when
gerhard
inform
the
homeowner
of
the
switch
to
tenant
of
indian
origin
they
renege
the
house
be
not
available
to
rent
they
declare
we
can
guess
why
these
owner
pull
out
but
raj
and
i
just
move
on
we
need
to
find
a
house
and
have
no
time
or
energy
to
dwell
on
this

at
this
point
we
need
reliable
affordable
childcare
for
preetha
someone
to
support
a
child
in
elementary
school
this
time
we
decide
to
hire
a
live
in
nanny
through
a
reputable
agency
since
we
be
eager
to
find
someone
who
be
screen
and
trustworthy
and
who
could
drive
preetha
to
school
we
chose
a
young
woman
in
her
midtwenties
from
upstate
new
york
we
like
her
although
preetha
seem
to
watch
a
lot
of
tv
when
we
weren
t
around
we
spoke
to
the
nanny
about
engage
more
with
the
child
reading
book
and
play
but
nothing
much
change
one
even
the
nanny
go
into
new
york
city
with
a
friend
to
a
party
and
inform
us
the
next
day
that
there
be
an
incident
involve
her
friend
in
the
house
where
the
party
be
held
she
wasn
t
part
of
it
she
say
but
the
police
might
show
up
to
question
her
we
let
her
go
we
return
to
the
nanny
agency
which
charge
a
sizable
fee
for
every
placement
and
picked
someone
else
from
the
database
who
we
hop
would
last
longer
she
be
from
the
midwest
and
appear
pleasant
in
her
bio
and
photograph
we
interviewed
her
by
phone
she
sound
capable
and
organize
after
a
couple
of
week
though
we
realize
that
she
couldn
t
keep
up
with
the
demand
of
the
job
she
be
kind
but
we
couldn
t
be
constantly
worry
about
how
she
d
get
through
the
day
we
have
to
let
her
go
too
we
felt
desperate
for
these
nanny
to
work
out
and
have
the
resource
to
fit
the
right
person
comfortably
into
our
family
but
the
process
be
so
fraught
and
stressful
that
like
million
of
other
work
parent
we
bail
out
on
any
formal
plan
amma
held
the
fort
off
and
on
and
we
found
a
retire
woman
in
the
neighborhood
who
babysat
preetha
when
we
need
her
frank
drove
preetha
to
school
if
raj
or
i
couldn
t
do
it


for
me
and
raj
this
be
a
time
of
hope
stress
excitement
and
trepidation
as
my
pregnancy
progress
i
go
from
brutal
morning
sickness
to
intense
fatigue
work
travel
and
try
to
live
up
to
the
expectation
of
be
a
great
executive
mother
wife
and
daughter
my
mother
living
with
us
brought
great
advantage
and
over
time
some
difficulty
she
have
her
own
way
of
parent
preetha
sleep
time
and
din
time
be
fairly
lax
and
tv
watch
be
equally
random
raj
want
a
little
more
routine
and
discipline
in
preetha
s
life
my
mother
kept
remind
us
that
she
d
raise
three
kid
and
knew
what
she
be
do
i
didn
t
want
to
make
her
mad
raj
be
right
to
want
to
organize
preetha
s
life
a
little
more
i
couldn
t
change
my
mother
i
try
to
intervene
with
little
luck
there
be
a
lot
of
tension
in
the
house


multigenerational
living
so
natural
in
asian
household
and
many
other
culture
around
the
world
can
be
a
tremendous
advantage
to
work
family
mother
and
father
have
an
extra
set
of
hand
when
they
need
them
and
child
and
grandparent
connect
building
the
kind
of
deep
and
last
relationship
that
i
have
with
thatha
and
that
preetha
have
with
my
mother
and
raj
s
parent
this
model
also
work
for
care
for
our
elder
and
allows
for
young
adult
to
rely
on
support
from
the
home
base
when
they
be
venture
out
in
the
world
i
m
very
aware
that
it
s
not
easy
living
this
way
require
adjustment
from
all
side
it
limit
everyone
s
privacy
and
can
lead
to
tussle
that
hurt
elder
and
cause
rift
within
marriage
this
be
clearly
not
the
intend
outcome
whole
household
have
to
agree
on
boundary
and
behavior
to
keep
relationship
healthy
in
some
culture
where
multigenerational
living
be
common
it
can
be
particularly
hard
on
woman
who
be
caught
in
the
middle
as
mother
daughter
or
daughter
in
law
these
woman
may
work
outside
the
home
but
also
have
the
tremendous
burden
of
need
to
be
outstanding
homemaker
parent
and
caregiver
to
the
elder
every
move
can
be
analyze
and
criticize
a

may
be
deposit
against
her

have
the
freedom
to
make
her

population
and
a

figure
out
the
best
way
to
set
up
multigenerational

practically

become
urgent
do
this
well
with
inventive
architecture
and
development
and
connect
with

infrastructure
could
be
a
real
boon
to
work

in
way
that
reduce
the
pressure
but
capture
the
wonderful
benefit
of

together


raj
and
i
start
look
for
a
permanent
house
in
the
vicinity
of
our
noroton
home
we
like
be
near
the
water
the
neighbor
be
friendly
and
preetha
love
her
school
then
one
day
i
be
fly
to
europe
and
be
seat
beside
another
senior
woman
executive
who
also
live
in
the
connecticut
suburb
when
i
told
her
about
our
search
for
a
home
to
buy
she
respond
very
plainly
i
hope
you
be
not
think
about
lily
white
darien
or
new
canaan
i
be
struck
by
her
comment
but
didn
t
ask
her
what
she
meant
curiously
a
few
week
later
we
be
talk
to
a
neighbor
about
our
house
search
and
he
use
the
exact
same
phrase
what
be
you
do
here
in
lily
white
darien
he
ask
us
in
the
long
run
he
say
we
wouldn
t
belong
and
we
would
feel
unwelcome
these
two
conversation
in
rapid
succession
open
our
eye
to
how
our
experience
with
gerhard
s
rental
house
ran
much
deeper
than
we
d
imagine
my
father
have
always
told
me
to
assume
positive
intent
but
the
message
be
pretty
clear
these
community
be
not
for
people
like
us
we
move
our
search
to
greenwich
a
large
town
that
be
closer
to
the
new
york
metropolitan
area
greenwich
wasn
t
particularly
diverse
either
but
we
be
told
that
more
international
family
live
there
the
real
estate
agent
show
us
everything
that
be
available
and
we
found
a
lovely
house
within
a
short
drive
to
the
commercial
part
of
town
it
cost
more
than
we
d
budget
but
met
all
our
other
criterion
we
close
on
the
purchase
the
home
be
now
ours
when
we
move
to
greenwich
we
knew
we
be
go
to
be
living
in
a
wealthy
community
a
sort
of
bubble
quite
different
from
the
more
unassuming
house
and
surroundings
we
be
use
to
in
chicago
we
be
a
little
ambivalent
but
the
quality
of
the
school
the
safe
neighborhood
and
our
belief
that
we
could
protect
our
child
all
weigh
on
our
choice


shortly
after
the
purchase
we
hire
a
contractor
to
do
a
few
repair
before
we
move
in
a
few
week
later
i
return
from
a
trip
and
go
to
check
on
his
progress
and
found
that
half
the
house
have
be
strip
to
its
frame
the
contractor
claimed
the
building
have
much
more
wrong
with
it
than
expect
he
start
with
a
little
demolition
and
then
didn
t
stop
what
a
disaster
we
just
didn
t
have
the
money
for
a
big
renovation
i
be
four
month
pregnant
we
have
to
find
a
new
construction
team
this
guy
seem
dishonest
and
we
have
to
pull
off
this
project
on
a
very
tight
timeline
raj
and
i
felt
completely
out
of
our
depth
this
be
a
wood
frame
house
and
we
d
grown
up
in
the
flat
topped
concrete
structure
of
india
we
didn
t
know
anything
about
two
by
four
lumber
or
how
to
ass
the
require
pitch
for
a
roof
to
handle
the
snow
we
be
at
the
mercy
of
contractor
thankfully
to
tide
us
over
abb
lent
us
some
money
as
part
of
a
common
company
loan
program
at
the
time
and
helga
who
be
a
designer
and
have
renovate
many
home
before
knew
what
she
be
do
and
step
in
she
be
work
on
her
own
new
house
in
greenwich
and
add
ours
to
her
list
we
continued
to
be
two
family
rely
on
each
other
to
get
through
the
demand
of
a
broad
range
of
work
and
family
obligation
from
building
abb
into
a
dominant
global
company
to
make
sure
we
all
have
a
place
to
lay
our
head
at
night
in
mid
december
four
day
after
we
move
into
our
rebuilt
home
i
go
into
labor
the
next
morning
i
give
birth
via
cesarean
section
to
a
beautiful
healthy
baby
girl
tara
nooyi
once
again
my
love
for
the
baby
just
overtook
me
in
the
hospital
i
didn
t
want
her
out
of
my
sight
and
never
let
anyone
take
her
to
the
nursery
i
gaze
at
her
in
wonderment
and
prayed
that
god
would
give
me
the
strength
and
ability
to
be
a
good
mother
to
her
and
preetha
our
family
be
complete
raj
and
i
be
delighted
to
have
two
daughter
we
love
them
dearly
and
felt
the
great
weight
of
our
responsibility
we
want
to
protect
them
and
to
save
for
their
education
and
wedding
just
as
our
family
have
do
before
us
we
want
to
make
sure
they
could
dream
big
and
fly
high
we
talk
about
how
they
would
grow
up
to
be
care
contribute
citizen
of
their
community
and
country
and
perhaps
responsible
parent
themselves
someday


two
child
be
harder
than
one
it
be
clear
in
tara
s
first
month
that
the
emotional
physical
and
organizational
work
of
parent
our
girl
be
go
to
be
far
more
complicate
than
we
have
anticipate
i
realize
now
for
instance
that
i
should
have
paid
more
attention
to
preetha
s
adjustment
to
have
a
baby
sister
she
d
always
be
the
family
vip
and
she
particularly
treasure
the
joyful
time
alone
with
me
when
we
sang
and
dance
together
she
have
already
indicate
that
she
miss
me
because
i
work
so
much
when
she
be
about
eight
gerhard
once
ask
her
what
she
want
to
be
when
she
grow
up
i
want
to
have
your
job
preetha
reply
because
if
i
have
your
job
i
ll
always
be
with
my
mommy
when
tara
come
along
preetha
be
a
third
grader
in
a
brand
new
house
we
d
be
through
month
of
a
renovation
a
pregnancy
our
work
obligation
and
general
rush
around
i
thought
she
d
love
have
a
little
sibling
but
now
in
retrospect
i
understand
she
felt
jealous
and
upset
about
share
her
spotlight
she
act
up
and
disobeyed
i
be
preoccupy
short
temper
and
too
often
ignore
the
fact
that
preetha
too
need
me
meanwhile
little
tara
begin
refuse
to
sleep
unless
she
lay
on
my
outstretched
low
leg
while
i
be
propped
up
in
bed
pretty
soon
i
be
spending
my
night
in
this
position
a
habit
that
wasn
t
great
for
the
mood
many
time
as
i
try
to
get
some
work
do
with
the
baby
sleep
on
my
leg
and
preetha
snooze
beside
me
i
wonder
what
i
be
do
i
start
to
ask
myself
should
i
keep
work
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
i
quit
would
i
have
regret
and
resentment
that
would
create
a
negative
environment
at
home
i
have
no
idea
how
to
take
a
break
from
work
and
then
return
a
few
year
later
i
could
think
of
no
example
of
woman
who
have
do
this
i
be
concerned
that
any
hiatus
would
render
my
skill
irrelevant
and
that
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
reenter
the
job
market
contribute
to
the
economic
well
be
of
my
family
and
stay
intellectually
active
there
be
also
no
young
mother
around
who
be
work
from
home
even
temporarily
go
into
the
office
be
require
i
worried
about
all
this
and
struggle
to
sleep
but
i
kept
go


my
job
at
abb
remain
relentless
i
have
three
month
of
paid
maternity
leave
but
as
a
senior
executive
i
didn
t
feel
i
could
disengage
to
devote
that
time
to
my
family
the
work
didn
t
stop
in
fact
the
day
after
tara
be
born
gerhard
call
me
in
the
hospital
to
tell
me
about
a
project
that
would
benefit
from
my
input
i
remind
him
i
d
just
give
birth
and
be
recover
from
surgery
but
it
s
your
body
that
have
the
baby
he
joked
your
brain
be
still
work
gerhard
show
me
he
need
and
appreciate
me
and
that
i
be
important
to
his
work
he
also
knew
that
have
a
baby
be
a
big
deal
and
let
me
decide
when
i
want
to
return
but
after
he
told
me
about
the
project
i
brought
my
team
together
right
away
to
talk
about
it
they
be
all
men
but
they
too
knew
something
about
childbirth
and
told
me
i
be
nut
to
jump
in
so
fast
they
say
they
d
call
me
if
they
need
me
nonetheless
i
have
them
come
over
to
my
house
regularly
during
my
leave
to
discus
the
project
this
be
all
percent
my
choice
i
wonder
why
i
be
wire
this
way
where
my
inner
compass
always
tell
me
to
keep
push
on
with
my
job
responsibility
whatever
the
circumstance
if
i
feel
that
i
can
help
make
something
well
then
i
cannot
stop
myself
from
jumping
in
i
have
a
deep
sense
of
duty
and
find
it
very
hard
to
say
no
if
someone
asks
for
help
i
love
my
family
dearly
but
this
inner
drive
to
help
whenever
i
can
certainly
have
take
a
lot
of
time
away
from
them
much
to
their
dismay
i
sometimes
wish
i
be
wire
differently


by
this
time
we
have
more
money
to
spend
on
household
help
which
clearly
smooth
my
return
to
work
we
hire
a
retire
nurse
to
take
care
of
tara

big
help
to

any
question
they

and
then

me
in
on

year

big
collective
start
to
work
for
all
of
us
we
get
into
a
routine
where
i
felt
there
be
a
group
look
after
the
girl
and
no
individual
be
carry
the
whole
load
that
felt
healthy
and
familiar
to
me
for
almost
twenty
year
raj
and
i
take
very
few
vacation
although
every

be
full
of
fun
and
game
and
laughter
with

me
of
my
childhood
summer
they
roam
the
garden
without
parent
and
never
complain
about
mosquito
the
power
go
out
or
the
persistent
noise
the
minute
we
get
off
the
plane
in
india
it
seem
they
assume
a
certain
indianness
they
be
comfortable
wear
indian
clothes
and
eat
meal
off
banana
leaf
they
view
it
all
as
one
big
adventure


for
fourth
grade
we
move
preetha
to
the
north
street
public
school
in
greenwich
close
to
our
new
house
after
about
six
month
we
get
a
surprising
note
from
the
teacher
say
that
she
wasn
t
turn
in
her
homework
preetha
be
smart
lively
and
funny
and
she
enjoy
school
we
d
be
exceedingly
conscientious
about
her
education
she
be
surround
by
book
and
always
have
glow
report
she
be
only
ten
she
didn
t
have
all
that
much
homework
but
we
be
very
concerned
when
we
get
the
note
when
we
checked
her
room
we
found
the
work
do
but
not
submit
we
ask
preetha
about
it
and
she
have
no
real
answer
she
just
shrug
give
our
tendency
to
trust
teacher
and
school
administrator
completely
we
be
upset
with
her
and
give
her
the
time
out
we
thought
be
appropriate
i
discuss
the
situation
with
mary
our
neighbor
and
she
say
she
saw
preetha
as
an
unusually
diligent
kid
and
suggest
that
something
must
be
go
on
at
school
that
be
trouble
her
mary
recommend
we
consult
a
child
psychologist
and
with
the
permission
of
the
school
principal
we
arrange
for
the
expert
to
sit
in
preetha
s
classroom
as
a
silent
observer
it
take
just
one
day
to
learn
the
problem
accord
to
the
psychologist
preetha
put
up
her
hand
with
an
answer
to
almost
every
question
in
class
but
hadn
t
be
call
on
all
day
we
be
told
one
of
her
teacher
who
be
a
man
simply
ignore
her
but
that
wasn
t
the
whole
issue
at
lunchtime
preetha
sat
alone
with
her
meal
she
say
while
other
kid
sat
together
and
chat
and
carry
on
preetha
do
try
to
sit
with
the
others
but
they
push
her
away
and
when
they
be
finish
make
preetha
pick
up
after
them
we
later
discover
that
she
have
be

into
this
chore
for

and
the

not
intervene
we
be

d
put
our
daughter
into
a
situation
where
she
be
picked
on
like
this
apparently
because
she
be
one
of
just
a
couple
of
student
of
color
in
the
school
we
have
fail
to
protect
our
child
in

roger

a
tremendous
leader
and
thinker
who
become
pepsico

ceo
two
year
later
he

up
among

roger
s
favorite
approach
and
his
claim
to
fame
in
pepsico
be
that
he
make
big
change
to
big
thing
roger
s
day
start
at
a
m
and
he
refuse
to
read
anything
related
to
business
after
p
m
he
have
lovely
home
in
montana
dallas
and
the
cayman
island
and
spent
weekend
in
one
or
the
other
fly
fishing
horseback
rid
scuba
dive
golfing
or
visit
museum
he
be
wily
and
political
and
many
people
thought
he
be
curt
and
gruff
but
he
be
a
showman
at
heart
it
be
his
idea
to
sign
michael
jackson
and
his
brother
to
endorse
pepsi
in
the
early
s
and
when
that
campaign
boost
our
market
share
coca

stumble
by
change
its
recipe
to

roger
write
a
book
call
the
other
guy
blink
declare
victory
in
the
cola
war
now
roger
be
talk
about
restaurant
because
that
part
of
the
overall
pepsico
operation
be
suddenly
and
surprisingly
falter
the
problem
be
that
the
quick
service
restaurant
qsr
business
be
overbuilt
simply
put
every
new
restaurant
that
open
ate
into
the
business
of
all
others
but
pepsico
couldn
t
stop
expand
because
our
competitor
kept
expand
for
example
if
we
held
off
on
put
a
pizza
hut
in
a
new
strip
mall
domino
s
pizza
or
some
other
restaurant
concept
would
probably
take
the
spot
either
way
pizza
hut
restaurant
and
other
qsrs
in
the
neighborhood
would
suffer
this
bind
be
show
up
in
the
number
although
we
hadn
t
yet
figure
it
all
out
the
business
be
enormous
and
very
complex
involve
real
estate
franchisees
dine
in
establishment
delivery
drive
throughs
complicate
employee
recruitment
initiative
food
safety
system
marketing
and
on
and
on
i
knew
almost
nothing
about
restaurant
the
day
that
roger
abruptly
introduce
himself
but
i
want
to
prove
i
could
handle
any
challenge
he
threw
at
me
for
the
next
week
and
a
half
my
seven
person
restaurant
strategy
team
work
around
the
clock
to
prepare
for
our
meeting
in
dallas
the
presentation
a
few
dozen
slide
and
chart
present
in
the
big
boardroom
beside
roger
s
office
be
a
detailed
analysis
that
laid
out
the
value
driver
of
the
business
analyze
pepsico
s
history
in
restaurant
over
the
past
five
year
and
consider
its
future
prospect
we
conclude
with
a
list
of
question
that
need
answer
right
away
roger
be
impressed
but
he
didn
t
say
much
he
do
not
believe
in
compliment
my
team
return
to
new
york
and
shortly
after
his
secretary
call
and
ask
me
to
meet
him
at
a
m
the
follow
monday
at
the
private
airplane
hangar
in
atlanta
i
press
her
a
little
bit
for
detail
but
she
have
none
she
suggest
i
pack
for
three
or
four
day
i
fill
up
my
over
the
shoulder
garment
bag
and
briefcase
once
again
flew
to
atlanta
on
delta
air
line
and
found
my
way
to
where
the
company
plane
park
roger
arrive
on
a
pepsico
challenger
jet
we
get
in
a
car
with
a
driver
and
ten
minute
later
begin
stop
at
every
qsr
on
a
busy
commercial
road
near
the
airport
we
d
go
into
the
restaurant
and
roger
would
order
something
get
the
food
look
at
it
maybe
taste
a
little
bit
and
throw
it
out
then
get
back
in
the
car
as
someone
who
grow
up
never
waste
food
this
sample
approach
horrify
me
a
little
i
kept
my
opinion
to
myself
after
four
stop
he
turn
to
me
and
ask
well
what
s
the
scorecard
i
be
clearly
puzzle
what
do
you
think
we
be
do
here
he
exclaim
it
s
a
market
tour
we
need
to
understand
the
business
from
the
ground
up
he
step
out
of
the
car
to
take
a
break
i
quickly
call
richard
goodman
the
cfo
of
taco
bell
whom
i
barely
knew
and
explain
the
situation
richard
genially
told
me
to
track
order
time
wait
time
food
temperature
cleanliness
back
of
the
house
and
front
of
the
house
staff
and
any
other
variable
that
might
affect
a
customer
s
experience
i
use
this
input
to
rough
out
a
scorecard
on
a
sheet
of
paper
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
ranked
any
criterion
i
could
think
of
on
a
scale
of
to
this
be
my
first
experience
with
the
pepsico
sink
or
swim
culture
i
do
not
sink
at
about
p
m
we
go
back
to
the
pepsico
plane
and
flew
to
chicago
the
next
day
we
be
back
at
it
visit
fast
casual
dine
in
restaurant
like
olive
garden
california
pizza
kitchen
and
cracker
barrel
order
leave
and
score
on
the
third
day
we
do
it
all
in
suburban
washington
dc
i
get
comfortable
with
this
discovery
process
and
start
to
enjoy
it
as
roger
and
i
flew
back
to
westchester
county
airport
i
chance
to
open
the
local
newspaper
and
come
across
the
astrological
forecast
section

be
a
scorpio

today
you

will
remain
a
big
part
of
your
life
for
the
next
few
year
it
be
roger
in
a
nutshell
i
circle
it
and
give
it
to
him
he
read
it
and
with
a
smile
pass
it
back
note
i
be
a
scorpio
too
our
three
day
fast
food
foray
solidify
my
relationship
with
roger
for
year
to
come
we
barely
spoke
on
that
trip
but
he
saw
that
i
be
as
curious
about
operational
detail
as
i
be
about
the
broad
view
we
both
knew
he
be
under
the
gun
to
learn
the
business
himself
in
the
next
few
month
roger
and
i
work
together
on
what
drove
the
system
s
best
restaurant
the
answer
we
found
be
that
diner
need
attention
on
a
very
personal
level
lifetime
restaurateur
who
love
their
work
tend
to
innovate
for
their
own
market
with
local
promotion
and
other
enticement
their
location
be
cleaner
happier
more
love
the
manager
like
people
and
treat
each
customer
as
family
pepsico
be
a
package
good
company
that
be
approach
this
very
high
touch
business
in
an
impersonal
way
we
be
good
at
add
unit
and
hire
and
de
veloping
menu
item
and
as
long
as
the
restaurant
business
be
grow
this
way
we
do
well
when
we
have
to
get
more
sale
from
exist
restaurant
though
we
struggle
we
be
not
as
good
as
we
need
to
be
at
the
touch
part
in
bold
move
roger
cut
back
on
building
new
restaurant
and
franchise
exist
location
from
all
our
qsr
brand
to
our
best

immediately
improve
our
cash
flow
and
return
on
capital
with
franchisees
run
restaurant
well
sale
and
earnings
start
to
climb
roger
be
view
as
a
hero
i
learn
so
much
in
this
process
about
a
service
business
and
how
different
it
be
from
package
good
i
also
have
my
first
real
experience
on
the
front
line

to

me
to

there
be
dozen
and
i
enjoy
get
to
know
them
i
thought
they
be
smart
and
well
inform
about
the
overall
business
model
although
they
be
surprisingly
lack
in
operational
knowledge
never
really
dig
into
the
nuance
of
what
drove
sale
or
competition
in
early
pepsico
file
its

the

me
when
i
saw
it


in
addition

on
lack
international
diversity
they
work
hard
and
have
great
presence
but
i
be
a
little
worried
about
a
training
program
without
much
non
us
representation
in
the
group
after
all
pepsico

we
need
to
provide

operation
i
ask
our
internal
recruiter
for
more
diversity
in
the
next
group
four
month
later
he
proudly
introduce
me
to
the
late
hire
i
be
amuse
and
dismayed
they
be
all
canadian
apparently
our
recruiter
be
concerned
about
the
corporate
planning
team

the
department
have
won
the
pepsico

least
knew
the
rule
of
softball
and
be
ready
to
play
after
my
initial
disappointment
i
sat
down
with
the
hire
team
and
specify
exactly
what
i
meant
by
diversity
the
follow
year
they
do
deliver
with
an
excellent
group
of
truly
global
hire
but
the
corporate
planning
team
lose
the
softball
trophy
pepsico
still
come
out
ahead


in
early
after
nearly
two
year
of
work
like
mad
in
strategy
and
planning
i
be
ready
for
my
own
operating
role
with
responsibility
for
sale
profit
and
loss
this
be
the
career
path
for
those
rise
in
pepsico
and
critical
to
my
success

in
the
strategy
position

and
without
blinking
he
told
me
the
move
be
off
i
have
a
lot
of
operating
executive
but
no
one
as
strategic
as
you
to
help
me
he
say
it
be
high
praise
from
mr
gruff
our
london
arrangement
have
to
be
reverse
the
house
rental
cancel
the
school
notify
the
mover
stop
raj
and
preetha
take
the
news
in
stride
but
i
be
disappointed
and
not
so
sure
how
this
would
play
out
for
me
in
the
long
term
on
one
hand
i
d
be
more
involve
in
help
roger
reposition
the
company
on
the
other
hand
i
d
miss
the
opportunity
to
manage
a
business
it
be
great
to
be
appreciate
for
my
strategic
think
but
the
people
in
the
field
with
responsibility
for
profit
and
loss
always
get
the
most
respect
stay
put
would
certainly
restrict
my
career
growth
in
senior
management
position
in
most
company
stay
in
place
or
a
lateral
move
may
indicate
to
the
organization
that
you
aren
t
promotable
and
very
often
may
be
fungible
once
you
cross
into
those
vaunt
rank
there
s
no
slow
down
i
also
knew
as
a
woman
i
have
to
outdo
the
men
raj
and
i
talk
it
over
and
we
agree
that
this
wasn
t
a
time
to
worry
about
my
own
career
but
rather
the
good
of
the
whole
enterprise
the
new
ceo
have
make
his
decision
it
be
time
to
get
down
to
work


to
be
sure
it
be
a
very
tough
time
for
roger
to
take
over
he
have
stabilize
the
restaurant
but
need
to
determine
their
long
term
prospect
within
pepsico
a
separate
crisis
be
also
brewing
pepsi
cola
international
which
account
for
a
third
of
total
beverage
sale
be
the
next
division
to
significantly
miss
profit
estimate
our
venezuelan
bottler
have
defect
to
coke
put
our
percent
market
share
in
that
country
in
jeopardy
our
bottler
in
brazil
and
argentina
be
face
financial
difficulty
a
couple
of
key
executive
include
bob
dettmer
decide
to
retire
roger
be
force
to
sort
out
this
part
of
the
company
for
the
next
six
month
at
the
same
time
he
ask
that
i
confidentially
begin
a
full
independent
strategic
review
of
the
restaurant
industry
and
our
business
prospect
i
pull
together
an
experienced
team
and
immerse
myself
in
this
work
i
didn
t
have
an
official
profit
and
loss
role
at
this
time
but
i
be
deeply
involve
with
the
financials
of
the
whole
company
because
my
department
ran
multiple
mathematical
model
to
project
quarterly
sale
and
growth
projection
for
every
division
this
work
be
separate
from
the
individual
division
own
financial
forecast
and
cause
some
friction
my
department
s
number
be
sometimes
a
little
different
from
theirs
and
often
more
accurate
all
of
the
forecast
be
review
every
quarter
with
roger
and
the
company
s
eleven
senior
leader
in
a
big
meeting
that
i
come
to
find
very
stressful
i
be
the
only
woman
at
the
table
i
would
present
our
analysis
from
headquarters
which
be
use
to
manage
investor
expectation
and
then
the
division
president
would
weigh
in
with
their
own
perspective
when
the
number
differ
the
criticism
of
my
department
could
be
very
mean
i
be
particularly
insult
by
accusation
that
corporate
planning
be
try
to
run
the
company
in
reality
the
whole
thing
be
a
charade
some
division
president
would
be
vocally
upset
if
my
department
s
model
suggest
they
could
do
well
but
also
mutedly
miffed
if
we
say
they
be
too
optimistic
they
just
didn
t
want
to
upset
the
ceo
by
be
wrong
either
way
quarter
after
quarter
i
felt
hostility
from
a
few
people
in
these
meeting
and
i
be
increasingly
irk
that
no
one
else
in
the
room
ever
back
me
up
once
we
held
the
meeting
in
london
and
when
the
same
scenario
played
out
again
i
left
at
midday
and
flew
back
to
new
york
this
be
completely
out
of
character
for
me
roger
notice
but
he
say
nothing
as
time
go
by
his
failure
to
intervene
start
to
bother
me
too


in
september
we
finish
the
full
restaurant
business
review
and
sum
it
up
to
present
to
the
board
of
director
this
would
be
my
first
real
exposure
to
pepsico
s
board
and
i
have
no
idea
how
i
d
be
view
by
these
stalwart
of
industry
the
day
before
that
board
meeting
on
a
day
when
we
have
one
of
the
quarterly
division
president
meeting
i
go
to
see
roger
in
his
office
roger
i
m
ready
for
the
board
tomorrow
i
say
and
after
that
i
m
leave
pepsico
i
ve
put
up
with
countless
meeting
where
i
ve
be
humiliate
i
won
t
deal
with
this
anymore
i
don
t
want
anything
from
pepsico
i
m
just
go
even
though
i
d
always
be
willing
to
push
myself
to
the
edge
for
my
employer
i
felt
that
i
have
to
draw
a
line
when
it
come
to
others
respect
the
sincerity
of
my
work
on
that
day
i
didn
t
consider
where
my
career
would
take
me
next
i
just
want
to
get
out
of
what
i
felt
be
an
unacceptable
situation
roger
flinch
he
be
hold
a
pen
and
twiddle
it
nervously
back
and
forth
on
the
desk
i
could
tell
i
d
unsettled
him
but
then
he
say
i
ll
get
back
to
you
i
don
t
know
what
he
do
after
our
talk
the
meeting
that
day
be
delayed
by
several
hour
and
when
it
happen
late
in
the
afternoon
the
atmosphere
be
completely
change
for
me
everyone
be
incredibly
supportive
the
next
day
i
present
our
strategic
review
of
the
restaurant
business
to
the
board
and
be
very
satisfied
by
how
my
work
be
receive
i
still
remember
ray
hunt
who
be
then
ceo
of
hunt
oil
say
it
be
the
best
strategic
presentation
he
d
see
at
pepsico
or
in
any
company
i
be
on
cloud
nine
we
now
have
two
month
to
come
up
with
detailed
option
for
the
business
include
look
at
get
out
of
restaurant
altogether
that
would
mean
hive
off
a
third
of
pepsico
s
revenue
culturally
this
would
be
tough
on
many
people
in
pepsico
our
three
division
be
one
family
and
i
knew
the
restaurant
division
would
feel
betrayed
but
i
view
any
form
of
separation
as
unfettering
the
restaurant
from
a
package
good
company
that
be
hold
them
back
the
restaurant
have
to
be
an
independent
public
company
this
be
a
moment
for
brutal
objectivity
it
s
a
situation
i
found
myself
in
repeatedly
over
many
year
good
business
demand
tough
decision
base
on
rigorous
analysis
and
unwavering
follow
through
emotion
can
t
really
play
a
part
the
challenge
we
all
face
as
leader
be
to
let
the
feeling
churn
inside
you
but
then
to
present
a
calm
exterior
and
i
learn
to
do
that
after
that
board
meeting
steve
reinemund
the
president
of
frito

enthusiasm

show
up
too
let
s
get
crack
he
say
no
mention
of
our
conversation
he
obviously
thought
that
the
explicit
support
of
the
division
president
and
the
board
over
the
previous
twenty
four
hour
be
enough
to
prove
i
be
valuable
to
everyone

we
synthesize
the
message
into
six
graphic
easy
to
understand
poster
and
propped
them
up
on
easel
around
the
conference
room
in
another
important
board
meeting
i
lead
pepsico
s
director
from
chart
to
chart
to
explain
it
all
and
then
rest
my
case
coke
s
stock
price
be
unsustainable
our
competitor
s
earnings
growth
be
largely
held
up
by
onetime
item
include
regular
sale
of
piece
of
their
minority
interest
in
their
bottle
company
coke
many
year
earlier
have
separate
out
their
soft
drink
bottle
and
distribution
system
to
independent
public
company
that
mix
the
syrup
with
water
and
other
ingredient
to
make
the
final
bottle
product
this
ownership
could
be
increase
or
decrease
within
a
range
pretty
much
at
will
in
the
meeting
i
show
that
coke
s
return
on
invest
capital
which
drove
the
price
to
earnings
ratio
be
high
than
pepsico
s
because
coke
be
focus
primarily
on
make
and
sell
the
syrup
pepsico
own
our
bottler
but
roger
be
intrigue
by
our
competitor
s
financial
engineering
we
start
to
discus
how
we
could
spin
off
our
north
american
bottler
too
i
be
nervous
about
it
because
i
thought
that
cede
control
of
our
us
beverage
distribution
could
get
difficult
independent
bottler
would
want
to
set
their
own
growth
goal
and
i
be
worried
that
this
could
end
up
hurt
us
in
the
year
ahead
still
i
wasn
t
in
charge
roger
weigh
all
the
input
and
decide
that
pepsico
should
create
a
new
publicly
trade
bottle
company
largely
with
our
north
american
asset
we
would
retain
percent
of
this
company
our
strategic
review
of
coke
reveal
much
to
our
executive
and
board
about
how
our
competitor
be
deliver
its
number
it
also
prove
right
in
its
conclusion
once
roger
decide
to
follow
the
same
strategy
investor
wised
up
coke
s
stock
price
fell
as
much
as
percent
during
the
third
quarter
of


the
dealmaking
for
me
in
this
period
be
nonstop
in
the
midst
of
the
bottle
transaction
banker
for
seagram
call
roger
and
ask
if
we
d
buy
its
fruit
juice
subsidiary
tropicana
i
thought
this
be
a
great
idea
i
now
knew
pepsico
inside
and
out
and
could
see
the
gap
one
be
that
consumer
didn
t
engage
with
our
drink
or
snack
before
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
pepsico
have
once
test
market
a
product
for
the
coffee
crowd
call
pepsi
a
m
but
that
be
a
bust
tropicana
the
number
one
orange
juice
maker
be
a
great
grocery
brand
with
a
grow
international
business
after
an
intense
three
week
analysis
where
i
hustle
to
florida
belgium
and
england
to
complete
the
due
diligence
we
bought
tropicana
in
july
for
billion
in
cash
i
start
think
more
about
how
we
should
pay
attention
to
the
nutritional
value
of
pepsico
s
offering
soda
sale
be
slow
down
consumer
be
shift
to
noncarbonated
and
healthier
drink
aquafina
our
bottle
water
be
slowly
gain
traction
and
our
tea
and
coffee
be
do
well
we
no
longer
have
the
restaurant
and
our
balance
sheet
be
prim
to
make
substantial
change
health
and
wellness
to
me
be
undeniably
a
category
that
offer
huge
opportunity
i
d
see
this
come
on
the
home
front
i
found
it
more
than
curious
that
a
couple
of
child
at
tara
s
birthday
party
one
year
ask
if
they
could
phone
their
mother
to
get
permission
to
sip
the
pepsi
we
serve
that
sent
up
a
real
red
flag
for
me
one
day
i
ask
our
marketing
team
to
help
me
think
this
through
we
decide
to
set
up
a
health
and
wellness
advisory
board
of
six
expert
from
outside
the
company
and
add
a
couple
of
professor
and
nutrition
expert
to
this
group
at
one
point
we
also
take
over
a
little
use
conference
room
and
create
a
mock
grocery
store
with
shelf
full
of
healthier
product
that
we
imagine
for
our
portfolio
in
the
twenty
first
century
roger
tour
this
setup
and
be
intrigue
steve
saw
it
and
be
skeptical
in
part
because
he
thought
it
be
a
distraction
we
take
down
the
display
and
dissolve
the
wellness
advisory
board
for
several
month
i
wonder
if
i
have
cave
in
too
early
should
i
have
come
back
with
fact
and
figure
to
prove
that
health
and
wellness
could
be
important
for
us
the
reality
be
that
give
all
my
other
priority
this
be
a
mountain
i
d
have
to
climb
later


from
to
i
work
and
work
and
work
i
d
go
home
at
night
take
a
shower
put
on
my
flannel
nightgown
to
show

up
reading

and
spent
long

for
many
year
when
i
travel
i
write
note
and
letter
to
preetha
and
tara
and
left
them
at
home
to
open
when
i
be
away
i
would
grab
time
whenever
possible
to
compose
these
missive
at
my
desk
sit
in
car
or
on
plane
or
at
night
in
a
hotel
before
i
go
to
bed
i
be
always
look
out
in
airport
gift
shop
for
sticker
or
little
toy
and
knickknack
to
include
with
the
envelope
we
end
up
with
quite
a
collection
of
doll
in
national
dress
from
finland
from
japan
from
brazil
these
note
and
keepsake
be
an
ongoing
private
little
project
for
me
as
i
carry
on
with
my
other
duty
it
kept
me
closer
to
my
child
although
i
know
it
be
a
poor
substitute
for
actually
be
there
for
many
year
the
guilt
of
not
be
a
full
time
mother
to
my
kid
in
their
early
year
gnawed
at
me
in
some
way
i
think
of
these
day
with
great
sadness
i
often
wonder
why
i
kept
go
the
job
be
intellectually
stimulate
and
i
truly
love
what
i
be
do
i
be
sure
i
d
be
miserable
if
i
quit
and
i
wasn
t
willing
to
step
out
totally
on
a
more
practical
note
we
be
still
pay
off
some
debt
from
the
house
renovation
and
our
expense
be
high
with
two
private
school
tuition
we
d
also
set
a
financial
goal
a
dollar
amount
of
saving
for
our
retire
life
and
more
put
aside
to
ensure
the
girl
could
be
economically
independent
and
in
the
back
of
our
mind
we
always
worried
what
would
happen
if
one
of
us
lose
our
job
raj
and
i
both
work
be
our
safety
net
probably
more
of
the
typical
immigrant
mentality


one
day
in
the
spring
of

thousand
of
talented
ambitious
woman
who
ve
step
out
of
big
company
make
perfect
sense
the
rule
of
engagement
in
corporate
leadership
be
absolutely
unforgiving
compromise
to
accommodate
home
life
be
unthinkable
brenda
didn
t
have
the
same
extend
family
support
i
could
count
on
and
in
job
with
relentless
travel
we
have
no
technology
to
really
connect
with
our
child
s
day
to
day
activity
from
afar
the
whole
issue
boil
down
to
time
she
told
the
press
in
when
she
be
interviewed
about
her
departure
hopefully
one
day
corporate
america
can
battle
this


our
day
be
still
only
twenty
four
hour
and
we
must
use
them
wisely
when
we
take
on
additional
responsibility
like
care
for
child
or
a
sick
family
member
the
best
we
can
do
be
use
the
hour
we
have
even
more
efficiently
without
sacrifice
our
performance
at
work
now
that
we
have
tool
for
remote
seamless
communication
i
believe
job
flexibility
and
remote
work
for
everyone
who
need
it
should
be
entirely
routine
this
will
give
family
the
chance
to
take
care
of
home
life
obligation
during
the
workday
without
feel
load
with
emotional
consequence
shift
worker
have
have
to
deal
for
far
too
long
with
last
minute
call
or
switch
to
their

that
foul
up
their
ability
to
plan
their
day
and
week
stable
work
hour
aid
by

should
be
the
norm
for
all
shift
worker
especially
those
who
have
any
sort
of

responsibility
employer
have
no
good
reason
to
deny
this
courtesy
relieve
the
time
conundrum
include
one
more
factor
too
address
the
culture
of
urgency
that
consumes
our
economy
and
workplace
deadline
be
incredibly
important
but
too
often
they
be
arbitrary
i
be
involve
in
hundred
of
project
with
tight
deadline
that
probably
could
have
stretch
into
a
few
more
day
would
that
have
make
a
difference
to
the
project
most
of
the
time
no
would
that
have
make
a
difference
to
my
colleague
life
at
home
as
caregiver
or
as
member
of
their
community
i
think
the
answer
be
a
resound
yes


i
have
just
settle
into
the
cfo
job
in
september
when
roger
get
a
call
from
bob
morrison
the
ceo
of
quaker
oat
ask
if
pepsico
might
consider
buying
his
company
this
be
a
big
one
the
quaker
oat
company
base
in
chicago
for
almost
a
century
be
certainly
a
household
name
know
for
its
red
and
blue
cylinder
with
a
reassure
picture
of
a
long
haired
quaker
in
a
wide
brim
hat
quaker
be
a
food
company
but
over
the
year
make
plenty
of
money
in
other
business
too
include
fisher
price
toy
which
it
have
sell
in
now
with
sale
of
about
billion
a
year
its
brand
be
quaker

a
roni
and
near
east
flavor
rice
couscous
and
other
grain
much
more
intrigue
to
investor
and
the
reason
quaker
stock
have
double
in
value
that
year
be
the
surge
popularity
of
its
sport
drink
gatorade
pepsico
have
long
covet
quaker
oat
we
d
be
in
casual
talk
to
merge
two
year
earlier
but
nothing
come
of
it
we
certainly
want
the
incredible
market
share
that
gatorade
would
give
us
in
the
isotonic
drink
market
but
we
also
love
the
quaker
trademark
which
would
so
beautifully
blend
with
tropicana
for
our
morning
lineup
our
own
effort
to
come
up
with
breakfast
option
weren
t
go
so
well
some
experimental
frito
lay
bar
be
squishy
didn
t
taste
good
and
be
roundly
unappealing
quaker
s
sale
be
not
an
open
auction
pepsico
be
quietly
ask
to
hear
the
pitch
roger
steve
and
i
and
a
few
of
our
operating
executive
flew
to
chicago
for
a
full
day
of
presentation
bob
morrison
and
his
team
met
us
in
a
hotel
boardroom
and
impressed
us
with
their
story
they
d
stabilize
the
company
after
a
few
difficult
year
and
believe
quaker
need
a
large
company
s
scale
to
grow
outside
the
us
we
talk
it
all
over
and
a
few
day
later
put
in
a
bid
within
hour
the
news
leak
that
pepsico
and
quaker
be
in
talk
and
then
the
pressure
be
really
on
quaker
agree
to
our
price
but
add
a
guardrail
to
the
agreement
that
would
protect
its
shareholder
if
pepsico
s
stock
fell
below
a
certain
price
we
huddle
with
our
banker
and
discuss
the
pro
and
con
again
roger
have
decide
that
the
three
of
us
roger
steve
and
i
have
to
be
in
full
agreement
about
everything
related
to
this
transaction
steve
be
uncomfortable
with
the
guardrail
and
we
push
back
but
quaker
wouldn
t
budge
after
two
week
of
negotiation
we
walk
away
much
to
bob
s
surprise
the
next
week
with
the
world
aware
that
quaker
be
look
to
sell
itself
coca
cola
make
the
deal
our
rival
would
take
gatorade
and
likely
sell
off
the
other
quaker
brand
we
thought
we
be
a
little
worried
but
decide
to
not
look
back
a
few
more
week
pass
then
in
late
november
thanksgiving
week
roger
steve
and
i
be
all
together
in
dallas
at
frito
lay
s
annual
budget
meeting
quaker
felt
like
it
be
in
the
rearview
mirror
but
we
knew
that
coke
s
board
of
director
be
voting
on
its
transformational
purchase
of
quaker
that
day
that
even
we
flew
back
to
new
york
out
of
the
news
feed
for
three
hour
when
we
land
our
blackberry
lit
up
coca
cola
s
board
include
a
skeptical
warren
buffett
have
vote
down
the
plan
to
spend
billion
on
quaker
we
assume
it
be
because
they
didn
t
want
a
food
business
they
knew
nothing
about
the
three
of
us
be
dumbfound
for
about
five
second
this
meant
the
quaker
ceo
bob
morrison
be
out
of
option
and
would
likely
come
back
to
pepsico
he
really
need
a
buyer
we
decide
to
go
home
to
our
family
for
thanksgiving
and
think
about
it
all
roger
manage
the
situation
perfectly
in
long
phone
call
that
weekend
he
make
the
point
that
if
we
go
back
to
bob
with
a
low
bid
than
we
d
offer
before
bob
would
lose
face
if
we
really
want
quaker
the
brand
the
people
the
customer
the
image
of
the
smile
guy
in
the
big
hat
we
need
the
ceo
on
our
board
for
advice
as
we
integrate
the
company
roger
propose
we
stick
to
our
original
bid
but
ask
quaker
to
modify
its
demand
for
the
financial
guardrail
a
week
later
we
announce
that
pepsico
would
buy
quaker
for
billion
unexpectedly
roger
add
a
management
shake
up

down
as
ceo

when

and
steve

serve
on

the
thrill
ride
now
we
have
to
make
it
work
we
d
promise
the
world
that
add
quaker
oat
to
pepsico
would
unlock
tremendous
efficiency
with
at
least
million
in
cost
saving
over
five
year
that
would
cushion
our
short
term
financial
commitment
and
help
pepsico
invest
in
more
big
idea
include
expand
our
snack
business
outside
the
us
back
on
we
all
knew
that
an
ill
conceive
postmerger
integration
could
doom
the
success
of
the
acquisition
we
d
see
that
happen
in
the
industry
before
lousy
execution
would
linger
on
our
balance
sheet
and
in
the
mind
of
investor
for
year
to
come
affect
our
credibility
we
figure
we
have
about
three
month
to
come
up
with
a
very
detailed
plan
to
blend
the
company
and
we
have
to
get
it
exactly
right
we
also
need
us
government
approval
which
require
prove
to
the
federal
trade
commission
ftc
that
gatorade
back
by
pepsico
s
heft
in

if
the
ftc
block
the

quaker
would
remain
a
pepsico
rival
so
our
planning
team
have
to
operate
completely
in
private
we
tapped

we
have
a

every
possible
cost

how
we
d
land
it
it
be
an
intense
time


meanwhile
roger

the
showman
who
sum
up
his

style
with
the
pronouncement
make
big

spun
it
off
separate
the
north

bottler
into
a
public
company
and
start
pepsico
on
the
path
to
a
more
balance
portfolio
of
product
i
don
t
think
this
broad
rethink
would
have
happen
without
roger
at
the
helm
because
he
have
the
complete
trust
of
the

to
very

even
though
roger

confuse
and
annoy
at
time
i
admire
him
enormously

work
at

at
the

time
he
always
try
to
do
the

thing
he
consider
pepsi
cola
s
one
hundredth

too
extravagant
and
chose
not

their
four
kid
i
of
course
be
never

trip
because
they
be
always
men
only
for
me
that
be
fine
because
i
want
more
time
at

i
be
confident
that
roger
wouldn
t
pursue
anything
significant
without
my
be
consult
or
involve


steve
s
frugal
approach
and
attention
to
detail
be
just
what
pepsico
need
when
he
take
over
in
we
be
now
a
pure
package
good
company
without
the
restaurant
and
have
to
earn
superior
profit
from
our
new
streamline
core
in
when
steve
be
transition
to
the
corporate
office
he
have
push
me
to
learn
more
about
what
he
call
the
right
side
of
the
decimal
point
the
penny
by
ask
me
to
oversee
a
major
frito
lay
logistics
project
he
be
right
to
do
that
he
knew
i
d
negotiate
dozen
of
million
and
billion
dollar
transaction
and
easily
handle
big
number
on
the
left
side
of
the
decimal
point
but
i
hadn
t
reckon
with
how
fraction
of
a
cent
over
huge
volume
drove
pepsico
profitability
indeed
i
hadn
t
really
dealt
with
tiny
increment
in
business
since
i
walk
from
shop
to
shop
sell
thread
and
print
fabric
for
mettur
beardsell
in

the
frito
lay
assignment
take
me
to
plano
every
week
for
seven
month
i
left
home
for
the
airport
at
a
m
on
monday
and
live
in
a
marriott
hotel
room
until
thursday
night
i
miss
my
family
terribly
and
of
course
the
technology
that
connects
us
today
with
smartphones
texting
facetime
or
zoom
do
not
exist
i
talk
to
raj
or
the
girl
on
the
phone
but
those
end
of
day
call
be
usually
short
and
our
communication
wasn
t
immediate
or
spontaneous
we
have
the
service
of
a
babysitter
and
a
housekeeper
and
raj
be
home
almost
every
night
that
i
be
away
we
have
agree
never
to
leave
the
girl
without
a
family
member
with
them
for
the
night
whatever
the
circumstance
this
require
a
lot
of
planning
on
our
part
preetha
be
just
start
high
school
and
tara
be
in
first
grade
it
be
a
very
precious
time
for
me
to
have
to
leave
them
for
several
day
at
a
time
i
threw
myself
into
the
task
a
massive
rethink
of
the
direct
store
delivery
system
that
be
a
hallmark
of
get
frito
lay
product
to
market
lay
s
doritos
walker
and
most
other
salty
snack
be
packed
with
air
so
they
don
t
break
and
that
result
in
very
large
lightweight
freight
the
product
also
sell
fast
so
store
shelf
need
constant
restock
all
this
mean
the
best
way
to
move
million
of
bag
of
chip
from
the
factory
where
they
be
make
to
the
consumer
be
to
deliver
them
directly
to
the

whenever
possible
without
interim

the

and
offering
new

wasn
t
expensive
for
us
at
the

almost
everything

some

we
launch

give
it
a
try
all
of
this
burden
the

every
type

need
different

for
people
who
bought

in
bulk
once
a
month
we
have
to
create
and
move
hundred

steve
want
to
double
the
capacity
of
the
dsd
system
and
reconfigure
it
to
handle
percent
more

we
have
to
remove

then
upgrade
everything
from

in
the
distribution
center
to
how
we
tailor
shelf
assortment
by
store
and
sell
area
it
be
a
herculean
task


of
course
as
i
sweat
the
detail
at
frito
lay
i
have
no
idea
that
we
d
be
buying
quaker
a
year
later
in
retrospect
that
plano
experience
be
really
critical
because
it
taught
me
how
to
look
for
the
small
cost
saving
by
the
time
i
be
work
on
the
postmerger
integration
planning
with
brian
and
john
i
have
some
expertise
in
find
the
nugget
those
two
work
in
their
confidential
bubble
figure
out
how
we
d
leverage
the
combine
scale
of
pepsico
and
quaker
to
pay
less
for
everything
from
our
packaging
supply
to
furniture
to
truck
tire
to
ingredient
like
wheat
and
oat
they
plan
how
we
could
consolidate
office
and
function
like
hr
accounting
and
legal
they
detailed
how
quaker
s
warehouse
sale
team
could
take
on
tropicana
and
small
volume
frito
lay
item
that
didn
t
work
well
with
dsd
they
found
almost
two
hundred
project
that
would
save
us
anywhere
from
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollar
to
ten
of
million
of
dollar
each
have
to
be
scoped
score
card
shepherd
and
land
within
a
year
the
bulk
of
it
have
to
happen
in
the
first
four
month
through
these
effort
we
deliver
more
than
million
in
saving
to
pepsico
s
bottom
line
over
five
year
twice
the
million
we
d
estimate


unfortunately
government
approval
didn
t
progress
quite
as
smoothly
as
we
expect
after
an
initial
examination
the
ftc
s
commissioner
decide
to
take
a
second
look
at
whether
buying
gatorade
give
pepsico
too
much
power
in
the
soft
drink
industry
we
then
have
to
provide
far
more
data
detailed
econometric
model
and
analysis
to
make
our
case
one
day
steve
drop
by
my
office
and
ask
me
to
take
over
the
ftc
process
work
with
our
legal
team
what
a
minefield
i
thought
the
executive
who
be
responsible
for
this
project
would
be
understandably
puzzle
and
insult
i
have
no
experience
with
washington
regulator
and
be
already
flat
out
with
other
work
not
to
mention
my
family
at
home
i
try
to
talk
steve
out
of
it
but
he
too
be
new
to
this
and
say
he
d
only
be
comfortable
if
i
be
on
the
case
if
our
hard
won
quaker
deal
fell
apart
he
say
at
least
the
two
of
us
could
say
we
try
our
very
best
i
have
to
turn
my
efficiency
up
another
notch
i
convince
my
mother
to
come
and
live
with
us
again
full
time
because
raj
be
also
extremely
busy
at
work
for
the
next
few
month
i
be
at
my
desk
by
a
m
then
at
least
three
time
a
week
by
a
m
i
board
a
pepsico
plane
that
be
on
standby
for
me
and
with
the
lawyer
flew
to
washington
we
met
with
ftc
staff
discuss
the
case
and
collect
question
by
p
m
we
be
back
in
the
air
and
i
be
in
my
office
by
i
pass
out
assignment
to
get
the
question
answer
review
the
previous
day
s
answer
and
carry
on
with
my
other
work
i
go
home
about
p
m
and
again
sat
up
in
bed
until
past
midnight
review
mail
and
make
to
do
list
our
whole
team
work
incredibly
hard
in
those
few
month
in
august
pepsico
s
plan
to
buy
quaker
oat
finally
go
to
a
vote
by
four
ftc
commissioner
the
decision
be
as
close
as
can
be
a
tie
that
meant
our
deal
be
approve
steve
and
i
be
unspeakably
relieve
i
come
away
from
this
process
thoroughly
impressed
by
the
ftc
staff
they
be
dedicate
focus
and
quick
to
learn
the
intricacy
of
our
business
they
didn
t
start
out
know
the
business
but
read
everything
we
sent
them
and
ask
difficult
and
insightful
question
these
federal
government
staffer
aren
t
as
well
paid
as
we
be
in
private
enterprise
and
in
those
humid
summer
month
the
people
i
work
with
didn
t
even
have
air
conditioning
because
their
building
be
be
renovate
yet
they
carefully
combed
through
almost
two
hundred
box
of
our
document
with
the
sole
intent
of
protect
the
american
consumer
from
the
adverse
effect
of
reduce
competition
the
transaction
get
a
very
thorough
look
at
one
point
i
remember
wish
that
all
american
could
see
their
tax
dollar
in
action
at
the
ftc
because
they
d
be
proud
of
this
well
intentioned
work
year
later
i
happily
accepted
an
invitation
to
deliver
the
keynote
address
at
the
ftc
s
one
hundredth
anniversary
event
i
recount
my
experience
with
the
ftc
and
belatedly
thanked
everyone
for
their
yeoman
s
effort
on
this
transaction


a
month
after
we
close
the
deal
i
move
office
again
into
a
huge
corner
space
with
ten
window
seven
on
one
side
and
three
on
the
other
it
be
magnificent
in
every
way
spacious
with
lovely
light
wood
floor
and
at
my
insistence
the
same
furniture
i
have
bought
in
my
first
week
at
pepsico
the
room
be
so
big
and
sparse
that
some
of
roger
s
old
furniture
a
couple
of
couch
and
chair
be
move
in
to
fill
the
space
i
felt
like
i
have
land
whatever
that
meant
i
also
get
a
substantial
raise
when
steve
become
my
bos
and
i
become
president
he
notice
that
my
compensation
hadn
t
be
adjust
to
reflect
all
of
my
responsibility
beyond
cfo
roger
hadn
t
bother
with
this
hr
never
brought
it
up
and
neither
do
i
i
love
my
job
and
felt
it
be
a
privilege
to
be
sit
in
that
office
i
felt
i
owe
pepsico
my
hard
work
money
be
not
my
driver
and
my
salary
be
impressive
i
thought
give
where
i
d
start
at
bcg
i
didn
t
compare
myself
with
the
men
around
me
some
of
whom
i
later
learn
have
be
get
generous
special
stock
option
grant
for
year
in
my
first
six
year
at
the
company
i
receive
nothing
like
that
now
the
new
ceo
give
me
a
meaningful
base
salary
increase
and
ask
the
board
to
award
me
a
special
stock
grant
i
still
wonder
why
over
many
year
i
found
it
typical
for
the
hr
department
to
skate
over
the
issue
of
woman
not
be
reward
quite
the
same
as
men
why
do
hr
people
tolerate
it
it
didn
t
seem
to
matter
if
the
hr
head
be
male
or
female
they
be
all
very
energetic
about
their
worthy
diversity
program
yet
defensive
if
i
ask
why
a
promising
young
woman
executive
wasn
t
get
the
same
salary
as
a
similarly
ranked
guy
we
know
that
on
the
whole
woman
s
median
salary
in
the
us
be
about
percent
that
of
men
in
my
world
pay
disparity
be
express
in
small
increment
a
woman
would
get
percent
of
the
base
pay
of
a
man
do
the
same
work
if
i
ask
why
she
be
get
percent
less
i
d
be
told
it
s
such
a
small
difference
don
t
worry
about
it
sometimes
i
would
fight
back
a
little
with
then
why
don
t
we
pay
her
percent
of
what
he
be
get
it
be
always
an
uphill
battle
when
in
reality
hr
should
have
be
flag
these
issue
and
systematically
address
them
in
any
case
i
found
the
very
people
manage
salary
budget
stuck
on
the
idea
that
the
men
should
get
a
little
more
i
wonder
if
it
be
because
hr
department
intrinsically
still
see
men
as
more
ideal
i
have
talk
to
friend
in
many
industry
and
this
pattern
persists
no
matter
how
outrage
we
claim
to
be
about
woman
be
paid
less


closing
the
quaker
deal
with
the
ftc
approval
also
ushered
in
a
somewhat
calmer
period
in
our
family
life
the
girl
be
get
a
little
old
and
more
independent
raj
be
work
on
a
start
up
and
be
in
both
the
us
and
india
a
fair
amount
and
i
be
busy
with
us
base
project
now
i
also
have
the
advantage
of
a
company
plane
this
be
revolutionary
for
me
for
my
entire
tenure
at
pepsico
up
to
this
time
i
have
witness
other
senior
executive
use
the
corporate
jet
for
business
trip
and
sometimes
for
personal
travel
until
the
ftc
work
i
always
flew
commercial
even
when
i
haul
alone
to
juice
factory
in
europe
and
florida
over
two
week
for
the
due
diligence
on
the
tropicana
deal
roger
didn
t
offer
me
a
company
plane
i
didn
t
ask
and
maybe
i
should
have
no
one
seem
to
notice
or
consider
my
situation
as
a
mom
with
two
young
kid
at
home
for
whom
time
be
so
dear
i
know
there
s
more
than
a
hint
of
elitism
in
discuss
fly
on
company
plane
but
the
reality
be
that
thousand
of
jet
ferry
businesspeople
around
the
world
all
the
time
particularly
if
they
run
global
company
once
i
be
president
of
pepsico
and
i
have
that
convenience
i
be
much
more
productive
on
the
road
i
could
work
quietly
with
the
privacy
to
read
confidential
document
or
discus
proprietary
information
while
i
travel
the
plane
be
a
fly
office
i
could
do
many
multistop
one
day
trip
i
be
home
for
dinner
more
often
than
i
be
earlier
in
my
career
and
help
my
daughter
with
their
homework
once
they
go
to
bed
i
would
read
and
go
over
work
in
our
family
room
often
with
the
yankee
game
on
mute
in
the
background
preetha
be
a
gift
student
a
national
merit
scholar
semifinalist
from
her
school
and
a
vivacious
witty
young
girl
but
her
teenage
year
be
not
easy
this
be
a
difficult
period
for
girl
in
general
but
have
me
her
mother
whom
she
be
so
attach
to
constantly
travel
and
with
zero
flexibility
to
take
time
off
to
work
from
home
when
she
just
want
me
around
be
tough
on
her
she
also
wasn
t
enjoy
sacred
heart
anymore
after
so
many
year
frustrate
by
the
clique
and
petty
fight
that
can
arise
when
grow
girl
have
be
together
too
long
to
top
it
all
i
realize
that
raj
and
i
be
restrict
her
by
refer
back
to
our
value
system
root
in
s
india
the
stylish
clothes
for
girl
preetha
s
age
at
that
time
involve
a
lot
of
spaghetti
strap
which
we
didn
t
like
we
want
her
home
on
saturday
night
by
p
m
we
question
why
she
couldn
t
just
always
have
her
friend
to
our
house
it
all
seem
so
reasonable
to
us
at
the
time
look
back
perhaps
not
it
be
all
too
much
for
preetha
she
chose
to
go
to
boarding
school
a
few
hour
drive
away
in

and
developed
an
eagerness
to
protect
our

for
the
future
we
be
very
proud
of
her
tara
in
the
elementary
school
grade
be
happy
at
sacred
heart
and
i
drove
her
many
morning
on
the
way
to
the
office
as
she
get
out
of
the
car
i
would
roll
down
the
window
and
merrily
shout
after
her
i
love
you
best
in
the
whole
wide
world
i
think
she
love
it
although
as
she
grow
old
she
do
take
up
turn
around
and
loudly
whisper
mom
stop
it
you
re
embarrass
me
it
never
stop
me
for
several
of
these
year
we
also
have
a
young
teacher
from
the
school
come
and
hang
out
with
tara
in
the
late
afternoon
and
help
her
with
homework
that
arrangement
work
out
very
well
raj
help
tara
with
math
over
the
year
with
mixed
result
often
i
d
get
panicked
call
mom
help
dad
s
way
of
teach
me
math
be
not
the
way
my
teacher
taught
us
i
m
get
more
confuse
i
could
hear
raj
mutter
in
the
background
these
teacher
have
no
clue
obviously
the
approach
take
by
his
school
in
india
be
vastly
different
from
the
sacred
heart
approach
the
petty
frustration
of
work
motherhood
persist
for
me
and
i
still
felt
plenty
of
nag
low
lie
guilt
the
school
for
instance
have
a
class
coffee
for
mother
at
on
some
wednesday
morning
i
miss
almost
all
of
them
preetha
have
accepted
this
reluctantly
but
tara
start
to
express
that
she
wish
i
could
be
a
real
mom
too
and
show
up
at
the
class
coffee
like
the
other
mom
what
could
i
do
i
call
a
teacher
at
the
school
whom
i
be
friendly
with
and
ask
how
many
mother
be
actually
attend
then
i
figure
out
who
wasn
t
there
the
next
time
tara
mention
it
i
rattle
off
the
name
of
the
other
mom
in
her
grade
who
skip
it
it
be
my
way
of
cop
but
may
not
have
be
a
satisfy
response
for
my
young
daughter
for
all
my
work
stress
travel
and
impossible
schedule
i
really
try
to
make
sure
i
be
a
care
involve
mother
to
the
extent
i
could
every
one
of
my
daughter
birthday
party
be
plan
and
execute
with
great
love
and
attention
to
every
small
detail
because
i
be
aware
that
those
day
be
special
and
fleeting
i
go
to
every
school
event
or
competition
that
my
kid
be
in
and
for
five
year
be
an
active
member
of
the
school
s
board
of
trustee
i
don
t
think
i
ever
miss
a
meeting
if
anyone
be
sick
or
hurt
i
be
always
there
which
be
in
my
nature
from
my
early
year
as
a
mom
when
preetha
have
chicken
pox
infect
me
and
left
me
with
a
seriously
scabbed
face
for
month
i
soothe
my
child
beyond
what
raj
thought
be
require
i
once
drop
everything
and
race
to
school
when
preetha
injured
her
ankle
in
gym
and
end
up
stand
to
the
side
while
this
daughter
too
told
me
to
stop
embarrass
her
it
didn
t
matter
i
have
to
make
sure
she
be
ok
another
time
i
be
in
california
and
get
a
call
from
a
hysterical
tara
she
have
two
rabbit
in
a
hutch
in
the
backyard
and
one
have
die
i
do
my
best
to
console
her
a
half
hour
later
she
call
back
the
second
rabbit
be
lifeless
too
she
be
beside
herself
i
cancel
the
rest
of
my
meeting
and
flew
home
i
also
can
t
overstate
how
much
i
rely
on
my
pepsico
assistant
from
to
barbara
spadaccia
a
smart
love
and
incredibly
generous
woman
in
her
fifty
with
no
kid
of
her
own
who
take
on
my
child
and
me
as
though
we
be
her
own
kin
she
be
my
unwavering
supporter
and
a
calm
voice
in
everything
i
be
try
to
accomplish
often
all
at
once
i
be
always
determine
that
the
girl
could
phone
me
at
work
anytime
and
they
be
regular
at
the
office
but
i
also
get
call
that
i
couldn
t
take
and
then
barbara
would
step
in
she
sort
out
all
kind
of
small
crisis
from
miss
school
supply
to
forgotten
assignment
sometimes
she
d
take
preetha
out
for
a
late
day
coffee
or
a
walk
just
to
talk
about
the
pressure
of
school
life
barbara
be
basically
a
part
of
our
family
and
she
work
very
hard
to
make
my
life
easy
barbara
once
stood
in
for
me
with
tara
at
the
mother
daughter
liturgy
event
at
the
school
a
special
service
in
the
chapel
with
a
processional
sing
reflection
by
one
mother
in
the
group
and
a
sermon
then
all
the
mom
and
daughter
exchange
letter
with
one
another
and
have
lunch
i
always
love
that
day
and
make
sure
i
be
there
but
this
time
i
have
an
investor
meeting
that
i
simply
couldn
t
skip
when
i
get
home
that
even
i
be
very
apologetic
to
tara

tear
up

miss
our
time
together
tara
wasn
t

year

awesome
steve
and
i
also
drew
closer
as
friend
when
he
be
ceo
and
i
be
president
of
pepsico
partly
because
he
have
twin
about
the
same
age
as
tara
he
make
a
big
effort
to
give
them
his
complete
attention
every
weekend
i
remember
drive
out
to
see
preetha
at
boarding
school
once
and
steve
pick
up
tara
after
school
to
get
her
home
i
don
t
know
of
any
other
ceo
who
be
quite
so
supportive
our
surrogate
all
those
special
people
in
our
child
s
life
who
support
them
encourage
them
and
love
them
too
have
a
profoundly
important
role
to
play
for
all
of
us
after
all
it
do
take
a
village
to
raise
a
child


my
work
at
pepsico
be
essentially
endless
i
never
go
to
bed
at
night
think
what
should
i
do
tomorrow
i
be
always
catch
up
answer
question
move
forward
i
once
flew
to
moscow
on
a
friday
night
to
help
a
young
european
team
develop
compelling
logic
for
a
russian
acquisition
they
want
to
propose
boarding
the
plane
home
two
day
later
on
a
sunday
afternoon
i
exclaim
do
you
guy
realize
i
give
up
my
weekend
and
flew
all
the
way
to
moscow
to
help
you
prepare
for
a
presentation
to
me
next
friday
we
know
one
respond
thank
you
for
be
indra
nooyi
our
teacher
we
now
feel
much
well
about
how
we
ll
do
with
indra
nooyi
the
president
and
cfo
with
extremely
high
standard
in
these
same
year
i
begin
an
enormous
redo
of
pepsico
s
entire
it
system
the
project
emerge
from
crisis
one
spring
day
in
frito
lay
s
order
system
crashed
and
we
have
to
hire
hundred
of
temporary
worker
to
process
order
as
we
move
into
the
busy
memorial
day
weekend
the
backlog
be
huge
in
a
peak
holiday
period
frito
lay
have
more
than
order
a
day
and
human
just
couldn
t
do
it
all
we
be
cop
with
old
legacy
system
and
most
of
the
people
who
knew
how
they
work
and
how
to
fix
them
be
retire
we
have
to
locate
some
of
those
people
and
call
them
in
across
pepsico
we
have
many
system
like
this
piecemeal
technology
that
be
increasingly
unreliable
and
expensive
to
maintain
we
weren
t
alone
with
this
dilemma
many
large
company
be
confront
the
same
problem
and
to
pay
for
technology
update
be
take
onetime
charge
separate
from
their
ongoing
cost
so
that
these
expense
would
be
view
as
temporary
and
not
affect
underlie
operating
earnings
i
conclude
that
we
need
a
whole
new
enterprise
system
that
could
handle
pepsico
s
growth
a
major
investment
that
would
touch
every
part
of
our
operation
we
need
to
set
the
tone
at
pepsico
that
state
of
the
art
it
be
core
to
our
success
i
also
have
a
personal
reason
to
get
this
fix
new
federal
financial
regulation
the
sarbanes
oxley
act
require
that
cfo
and
ceo
sign
document
every
year
guarantee
the
integrity
of
their
company
s
financials
i
told
steve
we
need
robust
it
system
to
be
comfortable
about
signing
steve
be
reluctant
this
be
go
to
be
really
expensive
and
time
consume
but
he
told
me
that
if
i
found
the
money
i
should
take
care
of
it
for
several
month
i
work
with
it
and
external
consultant
on
a
plan
that
would
end
up
cost
billion
million
a
year
for
five
year
just
for
phase
a
couple
of
month
later
a
twenty
five
page
approval
document
be
on
my
desk
lay
it
all
out
twenty
people
have
already
sign
and
i
be
the
second
to
last
person
who
have
to
approve
it
steve
be
the
last
i
knew
that
if
he
saw
my
signature
he
d
go
ahead
i
couldn
t
do
it
i
couldn
t
sign
off
on
a
billion
capital
expenditure
that
be
so
technical
that
i
couldn
t
fully
comprehend
it
so
just
as
i
d
do
in
the
old
day
i
hit
the
book
i
bought
everything
i
could
find
on
enterprise
system
process
mapping
data
warehouse
and
master
data
management
and
over
the
next
six
week
through
the
december
and
new
year
s
holiday
season
i
study
it
all
i
cancel
our
annual
trip
to
india
which
the
family
protest
but
have
to
accept
in
january
i
go
back
to
the
team
with
a
long
list
of
question
and
once
they
have
answer
every
one
add
my
name
approve
the
spending
we
paid
for
this
system
which
take
more
than
seven
year
to
build
by
sell
some
share
that
pepsico
own
in
our
publicly
trade
bottle
company
i
think
that
leader
need
to
understand
the
detail
behind
what
they
be
approve
before
they
affix
their
signature
to
anything
this
be
not
about
trust
the
people
that
work
for
you
it
s
about
basic
responsibility
don
t
be
a
pas
through
i
think
the
people
who
work
for
me
come
to
appreciate
that
i
read
everything
they
sent
me
both
as
a
mark
of
respect
to
them
and
their
work
and
because
it
be
my
responsibility
i
know
i
drove
people
crazy
with
question
but
this
be
my
job
i
intend
to
do
it
well


but
what
about
leave
my
crown
in
the
garage
honestly
i
wasn
t
even
home
enough
in
my
first
year
as
pepsico
s
president
to
think
too
much
about
how
i
be
handle
the
relationship
between
my
professional
success
and
my
role
as
a
mother
wife
and
daughter
i
certainly
didn
t
feel
very
royal
as
i
hustle
from
one
project
to
another
and
make
all
those
trip
to
washington
i
be
just
try
to
keep
up
with
the
tremendous
responsibility
of
the
job
in
a
world
with
no
one
else
like
me
still
my
mother
s
comment
that
night
have
stuck
with
me
just
vague
enough
to
interpret
in
myriad
way
first
i
think
she
say
something
deeply
important
about
how
we
combine
work
and
family
she
be
right
of
course
that
no
matter
who
we
be
or
what
we
do
nobody
can
take
our
place
in
our
family
i
be
enjoy
big
success
but
the
stability
of
our
home
meant
i
would
be
equally
value
and
important
whether
or
not
i
have
be
name
president
of
pepsico
she
indicate
so
should
my
mother
have
just
let
me
share
my
great
news
yes
my
excitement
that
night
be
not
about
my
new
title
per
se
i
want
to
enjoy
the
moment
and
my
accomplishment
with
the
people
closest
to
me
and
to
share
in
their
pride
i
have
a
feel
that
if
i
be
a
man
a
husband
a
father
i
might
have
have
a
little
more
leeway
i
think
woman
be
held
to
a
different
standard
from
men
when
it
come
to
celebrate
their
professional
accomplishment
no
matter
what
we
do
we
be
never
quite
enough
get
a
promotion
or
a
prize
outside
the
home
sometimes
seem
to
mean
that
either
that
prize
be
easy
to
get
or
that
we
be
let
our
domestic
duty
slide
this
zero
sum
game
for
woman
when
it
come
to
work
or
family
achievement
be
pernicious
it
s
important
for
men
in
particular
to
see
that
this
hold
us
all
back
why
not
just
let
woman
soar
in
every
part
of
life
why
not
celebrate
what
we
do
well
when
we
do
it
we
all
love
to
see
our
daughter
win
at
sport
or
in
spell
contest
when
they
be
child
so
why
do
we
undercut
grown
woman
who
succeed
on
the
career
play
field
by
frequently
add
commentary
on
whether
they
be
equally
fabulous
at
home
to
be
sure
woman
don
t
help
themselves
or
one
another
in
this
regard
i
know
it
s
easy
say
than
do
but
we
really
need
to
let
go
of
perfection
i
often
felt
that
even
as
i
be
gain
influence
and
power
in
the
corporate
world
i
be
fail
my
family
because
i
wasn
t
home
more
look
back
i
m
a
little
heartbroken
that
i
spent
so
much
energy
worry
about
this
i
once
felt
so
bombard
with
commentary
from
my
daughter
about
how
my
work
be
all
consume
that
i
told
them
ok
i
m
go
to
quit
pepsico
my
heart
be
with
you
two
and
clearly
it
s
all
too
much
and
i
will
just
give
it
up
and
be
at
home
at
that
moment
it
seem
to
be
a
great
decision
but
then
i
get
the
pivot
no
mom
you
can
t
quit
exclaim
tara
you
have
work
so
hard
for
this
dream
big
mom
dream
big
preetha
wish
there
be
two
of
me
a
dedicate
always
present
mother
she
could
count
on
and
a
ceo
mother
she
be
so
proud
of
i
wish
this
have
be
possible
somehow
i
have
to
learn
to
let
these
wave
of
emotion
among
all
of
us
just
pas
this
be
also
endemic
to
a
mother
s
role
perhaps
i
be
super
commit
and
connect
with
my
family
and
no
matter
what
i
be
do
outside
i
still
have
an
important
part
to
play
in
absorb
everyone
s
feeling
sometimes
i
felt
like
a
punch
bag
with
everyone
s
trouble
attribute
to
my
be
a
top
executive
at
pepsico
even
though
i
struggle
with
these
feeling
i
know
i
be
supremely
lucky
to
be
married
to
raj
in
the
crunch
year
for
work
woman
with
grow
kid
and
a
demand
job
i
think
our
spouse
do
take
a
back
seat
and
they
have
to
be
able
to
handle
it
often
raj
would
tell
me
your
list
be
always
pepsico
pepsico
pepsico
then
your
kid
as
if
they
be
only
mine
then
your
mother
then
at
the
bottom
there
s
me
he
be
right
but
my
joking
response
be
at
least
you
be
on
the
list
in
reality
raj
transcends
list
i
be
sure
he
know
it
the
only
way
our
marriage
work
and
last
be
because
we
be
on
this
journey
together
for
the
success
of
our
entire
family
but
there
be
many
demand
on
my
time
at
pepsico
and
i
know
that
raj
often
felt
quite
ignore
for
any
work
woman
with
kid
a
supportive
spouse
can
compensate
for
all
that
guilt
we
carry
around
as
i
ve
often
say
be
a
mom
be
a
full
time
job
be
a
wife
be
a
full
time
job
and
be
an
executive
be
more
than
a
full
time
job
all
of
it
require
constant
prioritization
and
reprioritization
sometimes
several
time
a
day
and
depend
on
who
we
be
talk
to
we
feel
like
we
never
get
it
right
for
me
raj
be
there
at
every
step
ground
me
he
never
once
make
me
feel
guilty
about
not
be
home
with
the
kid
i
also
feel
that
a
sisterhood
of
friend
can
make
an
enormous
difference
there
be
time
when
we
don
t
want
to
be
told
that
we
be
wrong
and
we
don
t
want
to
be
told
what
to
do
differently
we
want
to
vent
and
be
heard
not
be
judged
i
have
close
dear
best
friend
woman
i
know
in
india
israel
and
the
us
whom
i
can
absolutely
rely
on
to
just
listen
to
what
s
bugging
me
they
aren
t
in
my
family
they
aren
t
in
my
work
life
and
in
no
way
do
i
feel
i
have
to
impress
them
or
prove
myself
in
any
way
they
span
multiple
time
zone
but
that
never
seem
to
be
a
problem


the
crown
in
the
garage
comment
also
speaks
to
the
broader
relationship
between
power
and
humility
this
be
an
incredible
lesson
for
those
who
rise
in
their
career
and
end
up
in
role
that
give
them
real
authority
in
the
workplace
and
in
society
over
the
year
i
start
to
downplay
my
job
with
my
extend
family
when
i
be
a
midlevel
executive
it
be
easy
for
them
to
talk
to
me
and
just
let
me
be
myself
once
i
rise
to
the
senior
rank
some
start
to
treat
me
somehow
as
more
of
a
stranger
they
assume
i
would
be
too
busy
to
speak
with
them
or
too
important
to
deal
with
normal
people
others
simply
resent
my
success
all
of
this
create
some
unease
in
the
family
i
adjust
by
keep
my
observation
experience
and
stress
to
myself
more
than
i
might
have
otherwise
and
make
sure
i
be
in
good
spirit
when
i
come
home
or
be
with
family
that
be
very
hard
when
i
be
think
about
decision
that
would
affect
hundred
of
thousand
of
pepsico
employee
consumer
around
the
world
or
an
earnings
report
that
could
influence
global
market
but
i
think
that
approach
be
necessary
to
maintain
sanity
and
equilibrium
in
my
life
outside
work
at
the
same
time
my
career
be
extremely
interest
i
be
good
at
it
and
i
be
try
to
help
steer
a
very
large
company
i
love
pepsico
and
where
we
be
go
i
love
our
product
and
our
great
idea
i
admit
i
be
sometimes
disappointed
that
i
couldn
t
just
celebrate
all
that
without
worry
that
people
would
think
i
be
some
sort
of
egomaniac
for
instance
when
i
receive
the
padma
bhushan
award
the
third
high
civilian
honor
in
india
from
the
indian
government
in
i
felt
genuinely
proud
i
imagine
how
pleased
thatha
and
my
father
would
have
be
to
know
that
i
be
on
a
list
that
include
prominent
artist
scientist
lawyer
and
social
worker
i
be
hand
the
award
by
president
a
p
j
abdul
kalam
in
the
impose
rashtrapati
bhavan
in
delhi
it
be
the
same
building
i
have
visit
for
tea
as
a
girl
of
fifteen
and
now
i
be
be
honor
there
raj
flew
from
the
us
to
be
with
me
my
mother
join
us
too
i
be
sad
that
preetha
and
tara
be
in
school
and
have
to
skip
the
event
no
one
else
in
my
family
call
to
congratulate
me
the
trapping
of
leadership
in
our
world
money
travel
meeting
famous
and
fascinate
people
beautiful
living
and
work
space
become
easy
to
adapt
to
and
accept
but
true
leader
must
keep
their
foot
firmly
root
to
the
ground
and
focus
on
the
responsibility
of
their
job
that
s
what
i
always
try
to
do
i
felt
i
be
a
role
model
with
everyone
watch
me
i
have
very
difficult
job
to
do
and
try
to
take
everything
else
in
stride
female
leader
have
this
much
tougher
than
male
leader
because
the
world
of
power
be
design
for
men
woman
be
always
break
ground
as
they
navigate
the
upper
reach
of
business
government
or
finance
we
have
to
demonstrate
our
gravitas
in
a
world
where
authority
and
brilliance
to
many
people
still
look
like
an
old
gentleman
and
we
have
to
absorb
dozen
of
the
simple
little
slight
that
show
woman
be
not
yet
fully
embrace
when
i
be
head
of
pepsico
i
once
exit
a
plane
in
mexico
with
a
team
of
guy
we
be
each
greet
by
the
immigration
official
welcome
mr
x
welcome
mr
y
welcome
mr
z
hi
indra
woman
obviously
have
to
spend
a
lot
more
time
on
their
appearance
and
can
t
cut
corner
in
that
department
without
risk
all
credibility
but
there
be
much
more
i
spoke
at
hundred
of
conference
and
always
have
to
worry
about
whether
i
could
sit
comfortably
on
the
chair
that
be
set
out
because
it
might
be
too
deep
or
too
high
for
me
in
a
dress
or
a
skirt
i
wore
the
same
beautiful
blue
ball
gown
to
two
gala
event
in
new
york
two
year
apart
and
heard
comment
from
photographer
who
wish
i
d
bought
a
new
dress
so
they
could
build
their
collection
of
stock
photo
of
me
every
guy
at
that
event
be
probably
in
the
same
tuxedo
he
d
worn
for
a
decade
i
be
once
on
the
cover
of
greenwich
magazine
wear
my
favorite
armani
jacket
that
make
me
feel
elegant
and
comfortable
i
thought
i
look
pretty
good
then
a
saleswoman
at
the
local
saks
fifth
avenue
department
store
call
and
suggest
that
in
the
future
i
come
to
them
for
a
more
up
to
date
look
before
any
important
photo
shoot
wear
a
jacket
from
last
season
she
observe
be
not
ok
woman
s
voice
be
too
high
or
too
low
or
they
be
see
as
too
short
or
too
tall
or
too
fat
or
too
thin
to
be
great
leader
these
judgment
wear
us
down
we
know
that
when
we
hear
them
about
other
woman
there
be
plenty
of
talk
out
there
about
us
too
i
think
woman
can
t
escape
the
reminder
that
we
must
always
weigh
our
power
whatever
it
may
be
against
society
s
expectation
that
we
must
at
all
cost
remember
that
we
be
imperfect


with
all
the
way
that
it
can
be
analyze
i
also
can
t
forget
who
deliver
the
crown
in
the
garage
line
that
night
in
the
kitchen
my
mother

the
same

always
be
torn
between

up
to
my
role
as
a

persian
rug
and
a

ooze
traditional
american
corporate
authority
hearken
back
to
the
portrait
line
private
men
s
club
and
smoky
banker
den
where
for
decade
the
real
deal
be
say
to
have
happen
what
should
i
do
i
have
to
claim
my
place
as
ceo
and
chairman
of
the
board
for
all
to
see
i
briefly
wonder
whether
i
need
those
old
trapping
then
i
decide
to
stay
put
i
have
the
fireplace
and
the
wood
panel
on
the
wall
remove
and
that
space
renovate
into
two
elegant
office
for
people
who
report
to
me


i
felt
i
knew
the
rhythm
and
responsibility
of
pepsico
s
ceo
i
have
work
faithfully
with
the
past
three
leader
deeply
involve
in
all
big
decision
from
spin
off
the
restaurant
to
buying
tropicana
to
separate
the
bottler
into
a
public
company
and
revamp
the
it
system
i
be
sensitive
to
the
pressure
of
manage
an
expansive
famous
company
and
to
the
season
and
mood
of
the
global
economy
in
tune
with
my
personality
i
be
probably
overprepared
in
twelve
year
as
pepsico
s
corporate
strategist
cfo
and
then
president
i
have
tour
with
truck
driver
walk
through
acre
of
manufacturing
plant
and
visit
with
retail
partner
in
every
corner
of
the
world
i
have
taste
hundred
of
experimental
chip
and
dip
flavor
and
sip
dozen
of
drink
concoction
and
i
could
weigh
in
on
every
kind
of
mouthfeel
i
be
learn
about
how
to
grow
potato
in
inner
mongolia
and
cut
water
usage
in
rice
field
i
knew
every
lever
of
our
profit
and
loss
statement
and
balance
sheet
and
have
credibility
with
our
investor
and
analyst
i
be
as
passionate
about
the
spirit
of
pepsico
as
ever
and
completely
intimate
with
its
structure
and
foible
most
important
i
be
a
dreamer
and
a
doer
and
i
could
paint
a
vivid
picture
of
the
future
for
pepsico
and
lead
people
to
deliver
on
that
vision
in
retrospect
i
understand
why
the
board
select
me
as
ceo
but
i
also
have
butterfly
in
my
stomach
when
i
walk
into
the
building
as
ceo
on
october
i
have
that
strange
feel
that
many
top
leader
have
try
to
explain
i
be
it
like
in
a
game
of
tag
i
felt
like
everyone
be
watch
me
and
wait
for
me
to
tell
them
what
to
do
next
i
be
catapult
into
the
wider
public
eye
i
be
the
eleventh
female
ceo
in
the
fortune
a
tiny
club
that
include
meg
whitman
at
ebay
anne
mulcahy
at
xerox
and
patricia
russo
at
lucent
technology
i
be
also
an
immigrant
woman
of
color
from
a
develop
market
take
over
a
very
well
know
american
consumer
product
company
and
that
make
me
a
curiosity
in
the
first
few
month
the
press
attention
be
constant
and
rather
punish
i
have
one
chat
with
a
senior
new
york
journalist
whom
i
knew
socially
that
stuck
with
me
he
say
i
d
be
the
focus
of
attention
for
some
time
the
press
would
gleefully
build
me
up
as
a
brilliant
different
new
ceo
so
that
when
my
inevitable
trouble
come
along
i
d
have
farther
to
fall
that
s
the
game
he
warn
me
so
far
my
relationship
with
the
medium
have
be
pretty
good
in
my
early
day
at
pepsico
i
have
no
public
persona
although
i
spoke
with
wall
street
analyst
about
our
strategy
and
finance
for
their
investor
report
on
the
prospect
for
pepsico
stock
as
cfo
i
present
pepsico
s
number
every
quarter
on
conference
call
with
the
same
analyst
and
with
investment
fund
manager
i
found
it
all
very
cordial
and
routine
after
the
quaker
deal
my
profile
have
ramped
up
businessweek
ran
a
story
contrast
steve
s
leadership
style
and
mine
look
back
i
realize
this
be
a
first
taste
of
how
i
d
be
persistently
perceive
and
present
differently
from
powerful
men
we
be
an
odd
couple
the
story
say
steve
be
a
former
us
marine
who
ran
marathon
i
be
a
woman
with
an
unsettle
habit
of
hum
during
meeting
to
calm
herself
the
article
call
my
wardrobe
business
indian
include
anything
from
a
flow
scarf
to
a
sari
it
go
on
she
ll
make
offbeat
comment
you
d
never
expect
a
high
level
executive
to
utter
and
she
have
sort
of
a
guileless
unencumbered
quality
in
forbes
be
prepare
a
feature
article
about
pepsico
under
steve
and
hastily
arrange
a
photo
shoot
with
me
in
our
parking
lot
for
picture
to
accompany
a
sidebar
then
they
use
my
photo
on
the
issue
s
cover
indra
nooyi
have
feisty
candor
the
story
say
it
include
a
quote
from
roger
indra
be
like
a
dog
with
a
bone
say
enrico
he
s
be
complimentary
i
felt
terrible
about
that
forbes
cover
story
because
steve
as
ceo
deserve
the
attention
it
make
no
sense
to
me
that
i
be
the
one
highlight
this
episode
affected
my
approach
to
journalist
ever
after
i
be
always
wary
i
learn
that
as
hard
as
company
like
ours
may
try
to
manage
the
message
with
vast
communication
and
pr
department
it
be
an
uphill
climb
the
medium
will
write
what
it
want
to
for
well
or
bad
often
i
found
story
on
pepsico
in
newspaper
magazine
and
elsewhere
fairly
straightforward
and
factual
although
the
headline
could
be
sensational
and
far
from
our
news
some
reporter
publish
story
base
on
rumor
that
weren
t
true
and
create
noise
in
the
company
that
be
difficult
to
quiet
still
for
all
the
challenge
that
the
medium
pose
for
public
figure
like
me
i
remain
convince
that
the
press
be
a
critical
element
of
democracy
and
must
be
celebrate
and
nurture
i
do
urge
journalist
who
cover
company
to
recommit
to
their
core
mission
of
detailed
reporting
and
analysis
and
to
really
spend
the
time
to
learn
the
complicate
business
and
industry
they
cover
writer
also
should
not
sacrifice
the
essence
of
a
story
for
a
dramatic
headline
accuracy
be
so
fundamental
to
our
system
work
when
i
rise
to
ceo
in
the
press
be
again
thrill
to
celebrate
my
exoticism
as
a
woman
and
indian
immigrant
i
be
present
in
a
sari
and
sometimes
enhance
by
bare
foot
i
hadn
t
worn
a
sari
to
work
since
my
booz
allen
hamilton
internship
in
chicago
twenty
five
year
earlier
i
do
occasionally
kick
off
my
shoe
in
the
office
after
p
m
like
almost
every
executive
woman
in
pump
one
wall
street
journal
story
when
i
take
over
with
the
headline
pepsi
s
new
ceo
doesn
t
keep
her
opinion
bottle
up
describes
me
in
the
first
paragraph
wear
a
sari
and
celebrate
harry
belafonte
by
sing
day
o
in
reality
i
briefly
introduce
mr
belafonte
and
as
a
group
we
all
sang
day
o
at
a
diversity
and
inclusion
event
i
be
wear
a
business
suit
with
my
trademark
flow
scarf
maybe
they
thought
that
be
a
sari
to
be
clear
since
my
teary
conversation
with
jane
morrison
in
her
office
at
yale
after
that
uncomfortable
interview
i
have
embrace
the
idea
that
anyone
include
me
should
wear
whatever
neat
and
respectful
attire
they
feel
comfortable
in
i
have
adopt
a
philosophy
that
people
should
be
able
to
bring
their
whole
self
to
work
i
see
this
as
fundamental
to
inclusivity
in
any
organization
however
i
admit
it
be
discourage
that
as
i
step
up
to
lead
the
second
large
food
and
beverage
company
in
the
world
i
be
often
described
as
some
sort
of
zany
outsider
with
a
penchant
for
traditional
indian
dress
separately
i
experienced
a
groundswell
of
support
from
the
indian
and
indian
american
community
for
so
long
indian
immigrant
like
me
have
be
view
as
nerdy
people
in
science
only
capable
of
run
silicon
valley
startup
i
heard
from
a
friend
at
an
investment
bank
who
told
me
that
he
and
other
indian
american
in
us
business
be
hold
their
head
a
little
high
and
feel
they
might
be
take
more
seriously
as
potential
leader
in
their
own
firm
because
for
the
first
time
an
indian
american
be
finally
head
up
a
quintessential
american
consumer
company


in
my
first
week
as
ceo
i
have
to
put
my
team
in
place
this
be
tricky
business
i
want
to
surround
myself
with
strong
leader
to
make
sure
i
always
have
honest
feedback
the
management
changeover
from
steve
inspire
a
few
retirement
and
that
be
ok
in
one
surprise
for
me
my
assistant
barbara
left
sadly
her
mother
have
die
a
few
month
earlier
and
she
resign
to
care
for
her
ail
father
for
a
time
i
felt
like
i
d
lose
my
right
hand
although
i
be
fortunate
to
then
hire
ann
cusano
a
pepsico
veteran
who
d
work
at
pepsico
for
more
than
two
decade
and
have
be
steve
s
executive
assistant
ann
really
knew
how
to
handle
the
conflict
and
change
priority
of
a
ceo
s
office
she
always
have
a
smile
when
anyone
reach
out
to
her
but
played
the
role
of
gatekeeper
with
great
aplomb
she
have
grown
child
of
her
own
and
have
deftly
juggled
motherhood
and
the
pressure
of
her
job
and
naturally
she
endear
herself
to
tara
and
preetha
she
be
support
by
jan
niski
a
lovely
care
person
who
seem
to
be
an
extension
of
ann
s
efficiency
together
they
cover
the
ceo
s
office
from
a
m
to
p
m
and
handle
the
mound
of
mail
and
all
the
call
that
come
in
every
day
ann
be
with
me
until
i
left
pepsico
i
cannot
emphasize
enough
how
these
woman
for
more
than
a
decade
kept
my
life
in
order
and
contribute
to
my
sanity

promote
richard
goodman

our
international
business
unit

s
cfo
he
be
respect
meticulous
and
fearless
in
give
his
opinion
in
a
similar
vein

former
general
motor
executive
who
be
on
pepsico
s
board
to
join

many
of
our
hr
process
and
practice
for
the
decade

great
idea
which
she
frequently
express
at
board
meeting
i
need
her
around

that
i
retain
larry
thompson

former
deputy

attorney
general
as
our
general
counsel

and
absorb
everything
around
him
but
in
one
on
one
session
with
me
he
d
say
exactly
when
i
be
wrong
or
right
and
he
d
never
hold
back
one
day
i
walk
over
to
larry
s
office
and
then
without
really
planning
it
i
told
him
he
be
fire
he
be
confuse
ten
second
later
with
a
big
smile
i
rehired
him
as
general
counsel
i
know
this
be
whiplash
for
larry
and
maybe
not
stellar
ceo
technique
still
he
later
told
me
that
even
though
he
be
shock
for
those
few
second
he
understood
how
valuable
it
be
for
me
to
rerecruit
him
for
the
job
from
that
moment
larry
be
my
general
counsel
and
energize
to
be
part
of
my
new
team
finally
to
keep
my
ceo
office

practice

start
rotate
in
an

and
come
executive
to
serve
as
my
chief
of
staff

eighteen
month
at
a
time
i
begin
with
john
sigalos
whom
i
d
work
with
in
the
corporate
strategy
office
and
who
be
now
in
bangkok
he
move
back
to
new
york
and
his
arrival
brought
need
order
and
structure
to
keep
track
of
the
new
demand
on
me
for
the
next
twelve
year
i
rely
on
a
treasure
group
of
outstanding
rise
leader
in
this
role
from
the
begin
i
intend
to
travel
a
lot
and
i
expect
my
chief
of
staff
to
travel
with
me
these
trip
would
involve
spending
time
with
our
business
of
course
but
i
also
want
roundtable
with
young
employee
separate
meeting
with
woman
visit
with
local
government
official
and
very
often
at
the
request
of
our
local
team
public
engagement
with
chamber
of
commerce
or
woman
s
group
for
every
meeting
i
require
this
person
to
prepare
a
detailed
briefing
document
in
addition
all
my
speech
have
to
include
my
early
input
and
then
careful
work
with
a
speechwriter
to
ensure
every
word
be
culturally
correct
this
person
also
kept
a
list
of
follow
up
item
to
make
sure
they
be
address
if
that
wasn
t
enough
my
chief
of
staff
have
one
more
very
important
duty
worry
about
me
in
a
public
set
be
the
chair
suitable
for
a
woman
on
a
dais
should
i
wear
a
dress
or
trouser
what
be
the
background
color
so
i
didn
t
blend
in
or
clash
could
i
get
a
vegetarian
meal
most
important
i
also
need
break
so
i
didn
t
get
overwhelmed
by
nonstop
activity
i
think
they
be
all
pretty
burn
out
at
the
end
of
their
stint
but
each
one
left
with
a
deep
understand
of
the
inner
working
of
a
global
ceo
s
office
as
i
step
up
i
could
sense
supporter
and
detractor
enthusiasm
resentment
and
some
skepticism
the
company
s
international
team
be
happy
that
i
have
a
global
view
and
that
mike
white
would
remain
their
bos
i
be
easily
accepted
by
the
pepsi
beverage
and
frito
lay
executive
whom
i
d
work
with
for
year
roger
and
steve
be
both
on
hand
although
they
let
me
be
i
always
appreciate
that
of
course
a
few
individual
be
loyal
to
their
own
idea
of
pepsico
one
write
to
steve
furious
that
the
board
have
elevate
someone
so
different
from
past
ceo
steve
write
him
a
wonderful
letter
back
outline
all
the
way
i
be
the
best
person
to
run
the
place


in
my
dream
i
create
a
new
era
for
pepsico
i
imagine
a
define
corporation
of
the
twenty
first
century
one
that
would
carry
far
into
the
future
proud
of
its
american
root
yet
global
and
nimble
enough
to
reflect
change
time
that
kind
of
corporate
longevity
isn
t
very
common
of
the
five
hundred
big
us
company
in
when
frito
lay
and
pepsi
cola
merge
just
seventy
seven
about
percent
remain
on
the
list
fifty
year
later
i
want
to
set
up
pepsico
to
be
successful
for
decade
and
decade
not
just
fleetingly
successful
during
my
time
as
ceo
my
instinct
be
that
pepsico
have
to
rethink
its
purpose
in
society
and
to
develop
a
new
model
to
conduct
its
business
i
be
also
influence
by
my
formal
training
in
india
by
the
conference
that
school
me
in
democracy
and
capitalism
and
by
my
internship
at
the
department
of
atomic
energy
in
bombay
where
i
d
see
how
powerhouse
western
company
interact
with
the
develop
world
yale
som
have
inspire
me
to
cross
ocean
for
an
education
focus
on
the
intersection
of
business
and
society
and
the
case
i
study
there
open
my
eye
to
how
company
be
embed
in
a
world
of
politics
government
nonprofit
community
and
family
all
must
work
together
to
create
a
well
future
in
the
month
after
steve
walk
into
my
kitchen
on
that
summer
monday
morning
i
ponder
all
this
even
as
i
go
through
the
busy
work
excitement
and
trepidation
of
take
it
on


the
task
be
monumental
pepsico
be
an
iconic
company
make
and
marketing
seventeen
brand
with
retail
sale
of
more
than
billion
a
year
each
the
most
of
any
consumer
package
good
company
at
that
time
people
ate
and
drank
more
than
one
billion
serving
of
pepsico
product
every
day
we
operate
in
more
than
country
and
territory
but
pepsico
and
our
whole
industry
be
also
be
bombard
with
criticism
that
the
sugar
fat
and
salt
in
our
product
contribute
to
the
scourge
of
obesity
hypertension
and
diabetes
in
the
us
and
increasingly
the
rest
of
the
world
we
have
acquire
quaker
oat
and
have
start
boost
our
nutritious
offering
we
d
eliminate
trans
fat
we
be
add
omega
s
to
tropicana
we
d
pull
full
sugar
drink
from
school
yet
all
this
seem
marginal
give
the
scope
of
our
business
pepsico
be
still
see
as
a
junk
food
company
the
pressure
be
intense
from
public
health
expert
parent
group
and
government
but
consumer
trend
be
drive
the
health
message
too
that
be
clear
even
inside
our
own
operation
i
be
once
in
egypt
have
dinner
with
our
local
leader
and
their
spouse
and
one
of
the
woman
told
me
how
she
be
reluctant
to
let
her
child
consume
our
product
because
they
lack
nutritional
value
this
be
incredibly
honest
and
useful
for
me
that
someone
could
be
so
blunt
even
when
her
family
s
income
count
on
pepsico
amped
up
my
sense
of
urgency
to
do
something
about
it
even
our
executive
habit
be
change
sometimes
i
notice
i
be
the
only
person
drinking
full
sugar
pepsi
in
conference
meeting
i
d
get
frustrate
that
i
have
to
argue
in
favor
of
more
marketing
support
for
our
healthier
brand
more
than
once
i
point
out
that
if
we
prefer
low
calorie
drink
and
bottle
water
ourselves
why
do
we
think
others
weren
t
shift
that
way
we
be
all
consumer
we
should
support
consumer
choice
for
sure
but
our
marketing
and
innovation
decision
have
to
reflect
the
change
time
our
rivalry
with
coca
cola
didn
t
help
matter
coke
have
no
food
division
but
coke
versus
pepsi
be
firmly
embed
in
the
popular
imagination
our
strategy
and
stock
be
repeatedly
compare
and
any
divergence
surprised
or
worried
the
market
this
make
change
tougher
for
us
we
be
always
pin
to
the
cola
war
but
in
reality
the
two
company
be
very
different
unfortunately
the
longtime
beverage
analyst
and
reporter
who
cover
us
be
comfortably
stuck
on
old
comparison
as
oppose
to
the
new
reality
of
our
portfolio
it
be
frustrate
indeed
for
example
in
coca
cola
s
namesake
drink
brought
in
about
percent
of
revenue
pepsi
cola
meanwhile
brought
in
about
percent
of
our
revenue
our
beverage
business
in
total
make
up
only
percent
of
pepsico
s
sale
to
be
sure
carbonate
drink
be
still
a
very
profitable
business
for
both
company
even
amid
decline
popularity
a
few
year
into
my
tenure
as
ceo
we
explore
change
the
company
s
name
to
a
moniker
related
to
anderson
hill
our
headquarters
address
to
separate
our
huge
diverse
portfolio
from
the
soda
brand
once
and
for
all
some
in
our
upper
rank
felt
a
new
name
would
give
pepsico
an
image
more
befit
of
its
product
line
but
after
think
through
logo
and
a
rollout
plan
and
then
calculate
the
cost
we
can
the
idea
we
couldn
t
see
spending
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
to
retire
the
iconic
pepsico
name
when
almost
no
consumer
buying
sabra
hummus
lay
s
potato
chip
quaker
oat
or
naked
juice
realize
the
product
be
all
link
to
pepsico


the
health
debate
wasn
t
our
only
big
test
i
be
also
worried
about
pepsico
and
the
environment
all
those
bottle
and
bag
all
that
squander
water
and
fuel
everywhere
i
go
particularly
in
develop
and
emerge
market
where
trash
collection
wasn
t
organize
i
saw
discard
plastic
and
wrapper
it
be
impossible
to
avoid
i
be
embarrass
and
i
felt
even
bad
when
around
that
time
i
get
two
letter
in
the
mail
first
a
group
of
us
legislator
from
east
coast
state
write
to
the
head
of
all
consumer
package
good
company
draw
attention
to
the
waste
wash
up
on
their
shore
how
can
you
help
i
remember
the
letter
ask
then
i
get
a
picture
in
the
mail
of
the
north
atlantic
garbage
patch
a
hulk
island
of
debris
float
in
the
ocean
that
have
be
tracked
since
the
picture
be
fill
with
drink
bottle
and
process
food
packaging
material
i
recognize
some
of
our
bottle
and
chip
bag
the
image
of
that
garbage
patch
which
i
much
later
saw
write
about
in
national
geographic
evoke
an
even
deeper
sense
of
responsibility
in
me
i
have
grown
up
in
a
household
where
one
small
bucket
of
waste
a
week
be
too
much
now
i
be
captain
the
convenience
culture
where
onetime
use
and
a
throwaway
habit
be
the
dominant
leitmotif
when
i
talk
about
the
letter
and
the
garbage
island
with
my
senior
executive
i
didn
t
get
much
reaction
i
felt
oddly
alone
it
s
not
like
this
be
out
of
the
blue
al
gore
s
documentary
on
climate
change
an
inconvenient
truth
have
just
be
release
and
the
whole
world
be
talk
about
the
planet
but
i
think
that
for
some
key
pepsico
executive
the
packaging
waste
problem
just
felt
too
colossal
something
that
would
require
a
technological
breakthrough
to
address
in
addition
and
they
be
right
the
convenience
culture
be
embed
in
our
society
and
would
take
a
lot
to
change
a
second
trouble
environmental
issue
for
me
be
water
the
value
of
water
be
in
my
bone
our
life
in
madras
be
regulate
by
the
flow
of
clear
clean
water
and
the
hour
in
the
day
when
the
tap
be
on
or
off
in
my
mind
i
saw
my
dad
at
the
kitchen
sink
wait
for
the
trickle
to
fill
our
pan
and
bowl
i
saw
myself
bathing
with
my
little
steel
cup
i
saw
the
woman
of
madras
line
up
wait
their
turn
at
a
public
well
at
pepsico
we
be
use
gallon
of
water
for
every
gallon
we
make
of
pepsi
cola
and
our
other
beverage
just
fifteen
mile
outside
chennai
i
saw
our
plant
draw
water
out
of
the
aquifer
use
powerful
pump
while
the
people
in
the
city
be
parch
on
my
watch
i
have
to
figure
out
how
to
make
our
factory
extremely
water
efficient
and
more
important
to
use
our
water
management
method
to
help
whole
community
improve
their
water
efficiency


the
more
i
thought
about
pepsico
s
future
the
more
i
felt
it
be
incumbent
on
me
to
connect
what
be
good
for
our
business
with
what
be
good
for
the
world
i
need
a
relatable
universal
plan
it
have
to
reflect
our
youthful
culture
and
signal
a
wise
evolution
of
our
historic
company
i
need
to
bring
along
ten
of
thousand
of
employee
and
bottle
partner
many
of
whom
have
work
for
pepsico
for
decade
and
love
it
just
the
way
it
be
i
start
reading
everything
i
could
about
transform
large
organization
about
manage
change
and
about
the
responsibility
of
corporation
i
consult
with
board
member
and
with
trust
friend
at
bcg
finally
i
decide
the
way
forward
be
to
rethink
the
company
under
the
umbrella
performance
with
purpose
this
be
my
opus
we
would
deliver
excellent
performance
as
be
expect
for
pepsico
but
would
add
three
imperative
to
our
work
ahead
nourish
humanity
and
the
community
in
which
we
live
replenish
our
environment
and
cherish
the
people
in
our
company
this
wasn
t
corporate
social
responsibility
or
philanthropy
focus
on
give
our
money
away
pwp
would
transform
the
way
pepsico
make
money
and
tie
our
business
success
to
these
objective
nourish
replenish
cherish
nourish
be
focus
on
human
sustainability
we
have
to
feed
people
and
society
responsibly
and
contribute
to
healthier
eat
and
drinking
by
nudge
consumer
into
make
inform
food
choice
we
have
to
keep
support
the
item
we
call
fun
for
you
like
original
pepsi
cola
and
doritos
but
figure
out
how
to
cut
their
fat
sugar
and
salt
level
we
need
to
dial
up
our
well
for
you
product
our
zero
and
low
calorie
option
include
pretzel
and
diet
soda
and
we
have
to
step
up
innovation
and
marketing
of
our
good
for
you
product
include
our
range
of
juice
tea
and
oatmeal
our
new
goal
be
noble
but
we
have
one
big
obstacle
taste
everything
we
make
have
be
optimize
over
the
year
to
taste
fantastic
now
i
be
propose
that
we
tinker
with
recipe
and
ingredient
to
reduce
the
very
element
that
contribute
to
that
taste
the
fat
the
sugar
and
the
salt
this
pose
both
a
complicate
technical
challenge
and
a
huge
opportunity
replenish
meant
ensure
environmental
sustainability
we
have
to
rethink
how
we
use
energy
and
water
reduce
plastic
in
our
packaging
and
set
up
recycle
system
we
have
to
help
our
farm
partner
use
less
water
in
their
agriculture
we
have
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emission
we
need
to
join
the
global
effort
to
restore
the
health
of
the
planet
and
couldn
t
wait
any
longer
for
more
evidence
on
global
warm
we
have
to
be
very
open
mind
seek
out
and
embrace
completely
new
idea
for
our
business
in
these
area
hybrid
and
electric
truck
solar
power
update
bottle
wash
and
irrigation
method
the
list
of
idea
to
explore
and
implement
be
long
and
grow
cherish
be
all
about
ensure
talent
sustainability
pepsico
have
to
be
a
supportive
empower
workplace
where
all
people
could
prosper
this
be
inextricably
link
with
another
press
issue
attract
and
keep
top
talent
to
make
it
all
work
we
knew
that
the
millennial
woman
and
men
flood
into
the
workplace
would
not
choose
pepsico
unless
we
turn
the
corner
on
health
and
the
environment
these
be
critical
table
stake
even
more
important
i
thought
be
help
these
young
people
integrate
work
and
family
millennials
be
face
enormous
stress
related
to
balance
money
marriage
and
kid
they
d
witness
their
parent
struggle
with
the
same
issue
they
have
no
idea
how
to
navigate
all
of
this
any
help
we
could
provide
would
give
us
a
competitive
advantage
we
have
to
come
to
the
realization
that
when
we
hire
someone
it
be
not
merely
a
pair
of
hand
a
person
the
whole
family
come
along
the
company
have
more
than
employee
and
we
have
to
cherish
every
one
of
them
perhaps
not
surprisingly
the
word
cherish
spark
plenty
of
controversy
over
the
year
it
be
too
soft
too
feminine
to
be
a
business
imperative
i
be
told
one
colleague
comment
in
a
note
to
me
that
the
word
prompt
audible
groan
that
accompany
eye
roll
back
in
head
like
slot
machine
and
have
absolutely
no
credibility
and
to
the
contrary
be
now
the
source
of
ridicule
well
i
guess
it
struck
a
nerve


shortly
into
my
new
job
i
travel
to
frito
lay
s
triangle
shape
headquarters
in
plano
texas
for
my
first
town
hall
meeting
as
ceo
the
auditorium
be
packed
i
talk
about
our
hard
work
and
challenge
and
celebrate
frito
lay
s
clout
in
the
company
i
float
pwp
and
then
in
a
private
meeting
with
the
senior
team
i
laid
it
all
out
this
be
an
experiment
frito
lay
s
manager
be
always
the
skeptic
usually
reject
idea
from
outside
their
own
business
but
i
knew
i
need
them
with
me
so
i
make
them
my
protagonist
after
an
interest
discussion
they
promise
to
come
back
to
me
with
their
thought
the
follow
week
i
be
cautiously
optimistic
three
day
later
frito
lay
s
cfo
and
the
head
of
strategy
flew
to
purchase
and
told
me
how
much
the
entire
team
love
pwp
they
understood
and
agree
that
the
time
have
come
for
the
hard
work
of
make
our
product
healthier
while
preserve
their
taste
and
all
the
fun
of
frito
lay
they
be
super
enthuse
about
hybrid
truck
and
solar
power
in
particular
and
saw
that
pwp
could
be
a
great
recruiting
tool
i
also
share
pwp
and
all
its
component
with
derek
yach
a
global
health
expert
who
d
work
at
the
world
health
organization
derek
have
be
a
vocal
critic
of
our
product
and
environmental
impact
i
thought
that
a
critic
inside
our
tent
would
help
me
do
it
right
i
hire
him
to
help
me
think
through
how
to
transform
the
company
and
communicate
the
change
to
public
policy
expert
derek
thought
the
direction
i
be
propose
be
bold
and
he
endorse
it
that
be
an
important
seal
of
approval
for
me
a
few
week
later
in
a
hotel
ballroom
in
scottsdale
arizona
i
present
pwp
again
this
time
to
pepsico
s
four
hundred
top
manager
from
around
the
world
who
be
gather
for
our
private
annual
conference
i
talk
for
more
than
an
hour
reflect
on
our
history
our
performance
our
brand
our
capability
and
our
wonderful
people
i
then
unveiled
pwp
in
all
its
detail
i
explain
how
pwp
be
not
about
give
the
money
we
make
to
deserve
cause
there
be
a
place
for
that
but
what
i
be
talk
about
be
a
new
way
to
make
money
if
we
didn
t
transform
our
portfolio
to
meet
change
consumer
we
couldn
t
grow
if
we
didn
t
focus
on
the
environment
our
cost
would
rise
and
some
country
would
deny
us
license
to
operate
if
we
didn
t
let
people
bring
their
whole
self
to
work
we
wouldn
t
get
the
best
employee
and
if
we
didn
t
deliver
performance
we
couldn
t
fund
purpose
performance
and
purpose
reinforce
each
other
it
be
a
virtuous
circle
i
threw
my
head
and
heart
into
this
speech
i
want
all
to
sense
my
deep
commitment
it
work
you
could
hear
a
pin
drop
as
i
spoke
they
be
electrify
no
shuffle
in
the
seat
and
when
i
finish
the
group
stood
up
and
cheer
i
be
relieve
and
ready
to
take
it
on
the
road


i
believe
in
company
i
think
the
world
be
well
off
with
large
private
organization
not
only
because
they
add
stability
but
also
because
they
innovate
company
create
job
and
offer
product
that
satisfy
people
s
demand
they
add
to
the
tax
base
and
create
community
but
i
also
believe
that
company
must
be
good
in
the
ethical
as
well
as
the
commercial
sense
some
thought
it
odd
that
a
modern
day
ceo
would
try
so
hard
to
move
an
organization
beyond
the
idea
that
a
good
company
exists
to
make
shareholder
happy
and
beat
the
competition
within
the
bound
of
the
law
but
the
notion
that
a
company
be
just
a
profit
center
be
very
recent
throughout
history
company
have
pride
themselves
on
their
root
in
society
and
the
legacy
they
leave
to
it
no
business
can
ever
truly
succeed
in
a
society
that
fails
i
believe
that
a
company
s
impact
on
society
need
to
be
write
through
all
business
planning
and
that
this
cannot
be
an
afterthought
what
s
good
for
commerce
and
what
s
good
for
society
have
to
go
together
with
pwp
i
have
a
strategy
simple
and
thoughtful
to
take
pepsico
into
the
future
i
be
quietly
thrill
that
frito
lay
s
manager
bought
into
it
early
and
that
our
global
leader
like
it
too
when
i
walk
through
the
detail
with
our
board
of
director
i
have
four
vocal
supporter
dina
dublon
the
former
cfo
of
jpmorgan
chase
sharon
percy
rockefeller
a
philanthropist
and
the
ceo
of
public
television
station
weta
in
washington
dc
victor
dzau
then
the
head
of
the
duke
medical
system
and
alberto
ibarg
en
the
ceo
of
the
knight
foundation
alberto
wrap
up
the
conversation
by
say
this
felt
like
the
only
sensible
way
forward
for
pepsico
i
have
the
wind
at
my
back
importantly
i
be
also
excite
that
pwp
resonate
with
our
young
employee
i
knew
that
friend
and
relative
grill
them
about
the
ethic
of
work
for
a
company
that
churn
out
treat
and
lot
of
packaging
waste
now
they
have
an
answer
we
be
work
on
evolve
pepsico
to
address
those
very
concern
this
initiative
come
from
the
top
but
drew
in
our
new
hire
and
intern
they
be
proud
of
it
the
investment
and
medium
audience
be
a
lot
tougher
shareholder
wouldn
t
stand
for
anything
that
might
affect
pepsico
s
short
term
profitability
target
and
when
i
told
them
the
plan
the
response
be
decidedly
mixed
some
be
very
clear
that
they
bought
pepsico
stock
because
they
believe
in
soda
and
chip
they
want
earnings
growth
today
not
a
new
strategy
for
tomorrow
if
they
be
interested
in
a
different
food
and
beverage
company
they
say
they
d
look
elsewhere
the
most
memorable
comment
come
from
a
portfolio
manager
in
boston
who
do
you
think
you
be
he
ask
me
mother
teresa


i
forge
on
as
it
turn
out
pwp
inform
all
my
decision
for
more
than
a
decade
the
strategy
held
up
through
the
global
financial
crisis
the
soda
tax
debate
and
a
fail
multiyear
campaign
by
an
activist
investor
to
alter
our
company
s
direction
pwp
constantly
test
my
resolve
and
deliver
many
of
the
most
gratify
joyful
experience
of
my
life
twelve
year
after
i
laid
out
pwp
in
november
member
of
the
business
roundtable
an
association
of
ceo
of
america
s
big
company
sign
a
statement
commit
to
a
stakeholder
focus
as
oppose
to
a
narrow
shareholder
focus
it
remains
to
be
see
how
many
will
articulate
specific
plan
and
metric
in
support
of
that
statement
but
the
fact
that
they
sign
on
to
a
broader
sensible
mandate
for
business
be
gratify
indeed
i
felt
vindicate
when
i
have
the
honor
of
be
include
in
the
smithsonian
s
national
portrait
gallery
in
i
sat
for
a
painting
with
four
object
on
a
shelf
behind
me
in
the
composition
a
photo
of
my
parent
a
photo
of
raj
preetha
and
tara
a
yale
som
baseball
cap
and
a
pepsico
annual
report
with
the
word
performance
with
purpose
on
the
cover


huge
change
have
no
shortcut
it
require
honesty
agility
and
courage
once
i
commit
to
transform
pepsico
i
felt
my
education
and
experience
merge
to
serve
that
mission
i
be
ready
for
it
i
knew
what
to
do
the
critical
first
step
be
to
frame
the
message
for
all
to
understand
and
embrace
i
talk
about
pwp
everywhere
describe
in
straightforward
term
why
the
shift
be
so
necessary
society
and
consumer
be
change
and
we
can
t
be
left
behind
i
say
in
every
possible
forum
this
be
about
how
we
make
money
not
about
how
we
spend
the
money
we
make
i
add
this
be
essential
for
our
employee
and
their
family
this
be
our
route
to
thrive
together
this
be
all
terrific
but
i
also
knew
that
no
one
would
take
my
grand
plan
seriously
unless
i
hire
the
require
talent
to
take
us
into
this
new
direction
and
put
financial
resource
behind
them
so
i
go
about
building
a
completely
new
global
r
d
operation
up
to
now
every
pepsico
division
have
its
own
small
r
d
unit
a
few
scatter
team
that
largely
respond
to
what
product
manager
and
marketer
ask
for
they
be
expert
at
flavor

and
package
graphic
but
have
engineer
no
radical
change
since
switch
diet
pepsi
to
aspartame
from
saccharine
in
pepsico
s
r
d
effort
be
never
connect
with
nutrition
physiology
or
the
intricacy
of
how
human
being
actually
eat
at
a
minimum
i
thought
we
need
new
lab
and
chemist
to
figure
out
how
to
reduce
the
salt
in
lay
s
potato
chip
cut
the
sugar
in
pepsi
cola
and
add
whole
grain
to
cheetos
while
leave
the
experience
of
eat
those
treat
as
satisfy
as
ever
but
i
be
much
more
ambitious
than
that
pepsico
s
science
could
be
at
the
heart
of
reimagining
the
global
food
system
it
be
a
venture
i
hop
that
would
far
outlast
me
at
pepsico
we
need
a
chief
scientific
officer
to
oversee
it
all
someone
who
be
part
of
the
executive
team
reporting
to
me
i
interviewed
a
few
people
for
the
new
role
and
then
i
met
mehmood
khan
he
be
president
of
global
r
d
at
takeda
pharmaceutical
the
japanese
biomedical
company
and
have
previously
lead
the
diabetes
endocrine
and
nutritional
trial
unit
at
the
mayo
clinic
we
have
a
fascinate
conversation
over
a
long
lunch
and
i
felt
like
we
totally
clicked
mehmood
exude
what
pepsico
need
leadership
experience
enthusiasm
vision
excite
i
offer
him
the
job
mehmood
decline
why
would
he
come
to
pepsico
to
reengineer
potato
chip
he
ask
when
takeda
give
him
so
much
latitude
for
lifesaving
work
in
the
drug
industry
good
point
i
thought
but
i
have
a
response
because
at
pepsico
you
can
taste
everything
that
you
create
drug
research
go
on
for
year
with
minute
advance
i
say
with
us
mehmood
could
build
an
entire
wing
of
pepsico
he
d
lead
the
conversation
on
what
people
eat
he
d
have
immeasurable
impact
on
public
health
he
wasn
t
convince
a
few
week
later
we
spoke
again
and
mehmood
recapped
how
hard
it
would
be
to
convince
the
outside
world
that
pepsico
be
serious
about
science
calorie
and
garbage
do
you
have
the
stomach
for
it
he
ask
me
i
assure
him
i
do
there
be
no
go
back
i
didn
t
think
we
have
any
other
choice
for
the
long
term
vitality
of
our
business
but
to
do
this
and
i
really
want
mehmood
on
board
in
december
after
six
month
of
talk
it
over
mehmood
finally
agree
to
join
pepsico
and
he
move
with
his
family
to
greenwich
from
chicago
he
begin
with
a
fairly
modest
budget
that
triple
over
eight
year
he
hire
dozen
of
new
people
with
knowledge
and
skill
that
pepsico
have
never
sought
before
molecular
biology
physiology
pharmacology
computer
model
environmental
engineering
he
brought
in

from
merck
dupont

our
facility
in
plano
chicago
and

new

and
set
up
research
center
in
china
mexico
and
russia
in
part
to
broaden
the
background
and
ethnicity
of
those

about
our
health
and
scientific
challenge
mehmood

how
we
should
approach

by
trim
the

so
the
human

year
this
prize
be
symbolic
for
me
it
underscored
how
no
purpose
driven
task
be
impossible
if
you
put
your
mind
to
it
i
told
people
about
the
lack
of
water
in
my
youth
and
found
plenty
of
others
in
our
global
company
with
similar
experience
once
the
emotion
take
hold
the
task
get
easy
we
also
have
the
great
advantage
of
be
able
to
commit
developed
world
scientific
resource
to
an
emerge
market
problem


transform
pepsico
with
the
idea
of
pwp
be
never
go
to
happen
in
a
vacuum
we
also
have
to
bring
our
industry
along
to
confront
the
world
s
health
and
environmental
challenge
i
take
that
on
too
i
accepted
the
invitation
to
deliver
the
keynote
address
at
the
annual
conference
of
the
food
marketing
institute
an
industry
association
represent
grocery
retailer
again
in
scottsdale
i
be
back
at
the
podium
in
a
ballroom
now
face
a
sea
of
season
executive
who
control
much
of
the
american
food
supply
include
the
ceo
of
the
big
package
good
grocery
and
agricultural
company
i
briefly
reintroduce
myself
to
the
crowd
for
the
first
time
as
pepsico
s
ceo
i
spoke
a
little
about
my
goal
for
our
company
then
i
start
talk
about
obesity
the
people
in
that
room
represent
company
with
a
total
of
billion
in
annual
revenue
i
say
make
us
together
the
thirteenth
large
economy
in
the
world
we
have
to
use
our
influence
and
resource
responsibly
we
have
to
confront
the
contemporary
affliction
of
too
many
calorie
too
little
exercise
and
the
devastate
health
and
economic
burden
on
our
society
we
have
to
act
together
i
suggest
we
all
adopt
sensible
nutrition
label
and
encourage
portion
control
and
physical
fitness
i
talk
about
walkable
city
legal
reform
for
playground
safety
and
tax
incentive
to
develop
positive
nutrition
i
threw
load
of
idea
at
the
crowd
and
finally
call
for
us
to
come
together
as
business
and
civic
leader
and
as
parent
and
care
citizen
to
change
the
trajectory
of
big
food
for
a
healthier
population
this
be
a
system
issue
i
say
and
we
need
to
collectively
promote
complex
behavioral
change
let
s
be
a
good
industry
that
do
what
it
possibly
can
not
grudgingly
but
willingly
not
as
a
last
resort
but
as
a
first
i
conclude
it
be
a
rouse
entreaty
to
the
most
powerful
decision
maker
in
our
corporate
universe
after
the
speech
i
especially
remember
steve
burd
who
head
the
safeway
grocery
store
chain
for
more
than
twenty
year
and
ric
jurgens
the
ceo
of
hy
vee
a
midwestern
retailer
come
up
to
me
full
of
enthusiasm
about
pull
together
i
believe
that
speech
which
spark
the
food
industry
s
subsequent
initiative
the
healthy
weight
commitment
foundation
help
turn
the
tide
on
how
the
us
food
industry
approach
health
and
wellness
the
foundation
be
set
up
as
a
nonprofit
to
help
reduce
obesity
and
grow
to
include
more
than
three
hundred
industry
and
nonprofit
partner
we
commit
to
remove
at
least
trillion
calorie
from
the
food
system
over
five
year
and
three
year
later
have
eliminate
more
than
six
trillion
calorie
we
partner
with
first
lady
michelle
obama
s
let
s
move
campaign
and
fund
community
health
program
in
thirty
four
thousand
school
this
kind
of
pull
together
to
address
a
societal
issue
be
very
encourage
to
me
it
be
possible
it
just
doesn
t
happen
enough
private
industry
with
its
incredible
ability
to
move
fast
and
efficiently
in
partnership
with
government
with
its
broad
mandate
be
perhaps
the
most
powerful
force
we
have
for
positive
change
in
society


through
all
this
systemic
change
for
pepsico
i
be
still
of
course
ground
by
my
home
life
tara
be
in
high
school
and
preetha
now
in
her
twenty
and
work
be
consider
graduate
business
school
i
felt
like
i
have
more
time
for
the
family
but
they
didn
t
need
me
as
much
my
commute
be
familiar
and
easy
we
d
do
a
few
more
renovation
on
the
house
and
work
on
the
garden
plant
tree
and
perennial
we
put
in
a
pool
although
i
have
no
inclination
to
learn
to
swim
we
have
help
at
home
antonia
our
housekeeper
be
dedicate
and
indira
who
cooked
for
us
kept
the
family
healthy
make
us
all
delicious
vegetarian
food
between
the
two
of
them
the
house
ran
smoothly
raj
s
travel
continued
but
we
have
to
do
less
calendar
coordination
technology
be
slowly
help
us
i
have
my
blackberry
to
talk
regularly
with
the
kid
whenever
i
be
away
my
time
day
to
day
be
pretty
much
my
own
to
dedicate
to
my
insanely
busy
job
but
i
never
shook
the
sense
that
family
be
ever
present
include
for
the
people
who
work
for
me
we
all
come
from
somewhere
i
love
hearing
employee
story
when
i
travel
to
pepsico
facility
around
the
world
and
always
take
the
extra
hour
to
meet
everyone
shake
hand
give
hug
and
take
picture
i
try
to
notice
when
one
more
person
want
to
greet
me
on
a
factory
floor
or
in
a
sale
office
i
felt
it
be
great
for
the
company
that
every
pepsico
employee
knew
me
and
felt
i
be
accessible
i
want
to
humanize
my
role
and
show
that
this
be
everyone
s
company
i
enjoy
real
meaning
in
my
job
as
ceo
because
of
the
people
i
met
and
how
they
invite
me
into
their
life
cherish
be
very
natural
to
me
it
be
not
uncommon
for
executive
to
bring
their
grown
child
to
town
hall
i
host
so
that
their
daughter
could
meet
me
fairly
often
senior
executive
would
seek
me
out
share
detail
of
personal
crisis
that
might
affect
their
role
at
work
i
always
listen
to
their
issue
and
make
it
a
point
to
follow
up
in
december
as
we
have
do
many
time
before
raj
preetha
tara
and
i
travel
to
india
for
the
holiday
break
for
a
couple
of
week
to
visit
our
extend
family
one
morning
in
the
house
on
g
n
chetty
road
where
my
mother
still
live
a
few
month
of
the
year
she
ask
me
to
sit
with
her
in
the
men
s
living
room
because
she
have
a
few
people
come
by
i
be
still
the
relatively
new
ceo
of
pepsico
and
hadn
t
spent
any
time
in
india
since
my
appointment
they
be
keen
to
see
me
she
say
for
several
hour
i
sat
in
a
chair
while
my
mother
s
friend
come
in
to
meet
the
corporate
chief
every
one
of
them
walk
by
me
nod
hello
and
then
go
straight
to
my
mother
to
congratulate
her
and
tell
her
what
a
great
job
she
have
do
raise
me
this
successful
daughter
the
ceo
of
pepsico
i
truly
enjoy
watch
her
as
the
center
of
attention
and
wish
my
father
could
have
be
there
too
how
proud
he
would
have
be
i
miss
him
enormously
when
i
return
to
the
us
i
reflect
back
on
that
morning
connect

life
as
a
high
profile

business
executive
with
my
year
as
a
girl
give
every
opportunity
by
my
parent
and
grandparent
to
learn
and
excel
i
thought
about
all
the
people
work
for
pepsico
and
how
commit
their
parent
must
also
have
be
to
get
them
to
the
point
of
contribute
to
our
company
so
faithfully
and
energetically
i
decide
to
write
to
the
parent
of
my
senior
executive
over
the
next
ten
year
i

by
percent
every

to
keep
investor
happy
that

very
well

have
hop
and

grow
by
double
digit
in
the
first
five
year
we
own
it
steve
use
trade
spending
discount
and
promotion
to
gain
share
which
work
very
well
for
a
while
gatorade
however
need
a
reboot
a
few
year
later
when
sale
flag
because
all
those
discount
have
undercut
its
premium
status
our
business
also
surge
because
wal
mart
the
world
s
big
retailer
expand
fast
in
the
first
part
of
the
decade

sell
pepsico
product
in
every
new
store
wal
mart
be
our
high
volume
customer
by
far
and
steve
himself
lead
the
sale
effort
unfortunately
for
me
just
a
year
after
i
take
over
the
whole
economy
head
into
a
tailspin
and
i
have
to
learn
in
a
hurry
how
to
manage
through
a
period
of
extreme
adversity
by
the
end
of
a
crisis
in
the
us
mortgage
market
be
ripple
through
bank
and
then
threaten
the
whole
global
financial
system
market
plunge
and
take
the
us
and
european
economy
with
them
the
so
call
great
recession
which
come
right
after
last
almost
three
year
and
completely
alter
our
business
landscape
in
particular
wal

s
expansion
slow
and
demand
for
carbonate
drink
in
north
america
dwindle
even
more
coke
have
make
a
major
reinvestment
in
its
business
in
and
be
reap
the
benefit
of
this
reset
commodity
price
include
oil
jumped
add
extra
expense
to
our
operation
a
rise
us
dollar
have
the
same
effect
we
need
to
grow
in
emerge
market
as
a
counterweight
to
the
lull
in
north
america
but
hadn
t
invest
much
to
develop
opportunity
in
china
and
india
over
the
previous
ten
year
among
my
first
big
trip
as
ceo
be
a
visit
to
several
city
in
china
to
well
understand
those
opportunity
and
challenge
i
d
be
to
china
a
dozen
time
before
but
always
with
a
narrow
business
agenda
this
time
with
tara
along
i
spent
several
week
learn
more
about
the
city
town
and
people
we
visit
home
and
i
get
a
much
well
sense
about
package
size
popular
flavor
and
how
family
stock
their
small
refrigerator
i
absorbed
how
multigenerational
household
function
in
china
with
various
family
structure
and
individual
role
i
get
a
much
fuller
sense
of
how
pepsico
should
grow
in
the
region
we
step
up
investment
in
china
follow
by
india
and
brazil
include
commit
more
than
billion
for
marketing
and
distribution
over
three
year
in
russia
we
bought
lebedyansky
a
fruit
and
vegetable
juice
company
for
almost
billion
in
early
and
later
add
percent
of
wimm
bill
dann
the
country
s
number
three
dairy
and
juice
maker
for
about
billion
wimm
bill
dann
pepsico
s
large
acquisition
since
quaker
be
very
important
to
me
because
it
add
billion
a
year
in
revenue
from
nutritious
product
include
milk
yogurt
and
baby
food
our
good
for
you
portfolio
be
grow
elsewhere
too
i
get
a
call
one
day
from
ofra
strauss
the
ceo
of

elite

our
snack
partner
in
israel

show
up
with
a
huge
hamper
of
mediterranean

name
it
she
laid
them
all
out
with
fresh
pita
bread
on
my
conference
table
and
we
enjoy
a
picnic
of
product
from
sabra
a
new
york
base
company
that
strauss
have
recently
purchase
it
be
a
delicious
lineup
totally
vegetarian
and
a
great
potential
mate
to
stacy
s
pita
chip
which
we
d
acquire
a
couple
of
year
earlier
less
than
a
year
later
sabra
and
frito
lay
sign
a
joint
venture
and
sabra
now
lead
the
us
hummus
market
more
important
for
me
ofra
be
one
of
my
dearest
friend


those
kind
of
agreement
be
very
satisfy
and
in
the
grand
scheme
of
thing
not
that
complicate
but
we
also
go
ahead
with
a
very
complex
negotiation
simultaneously
buying
back
control
of
our
two
large
beverage
bottle
partner
in
i
d
work
with
roger
to
spin
off
the
north
american
bottle
operation
into
a
publicly
trade
company
the
pepsi
bottle
group
ten
year
later
exactly
as
i
have
predict
we
be
constantly
at
odds
with
this
company
as
soda
sale
its
primary
source
of
profit
continued
to
slow
the
fundamental
problem
be
that
our
interest
weren
t
totally
align
the
bottler
make
more
money
when
they
sell
each
bottle
of
soda
at
a
high
price
pepsico
meanwhile
sell
the
syrup
to
the
bottler
and
so
want
more
bottle
sell
at
a
very
competitive
price
over
time
we
have
developed
an
uneasy
compromise
that
include
pepsico
provide
the
bottler
more
and
more
marketing
money
but
in
a
decline
soda
market
that
spending
didn
t
actually
increase
sale
very
much
it
only
propped
up
market
share
and
we
found
the
bottler
appetite
for
this
support
difficult
to
handle
because
it
shift
pepsico
s
consumer
focus
marketing
dollar
to
the
bottler
to
help
them
boost
their
bottom
line
the
situation
be
unsustainable
we
be
erode
the
beverage
business
in
a
very
involve
transaction
we
bought
back
our
two
major
north
american
bottler
for
billion
give
us
operational
control
of
almost
percent
of
our
bottle
system
this
be
time
consume
in
part
because
we
have
to
negotiate
with
two
different
party
pepsico
have
clear
parameter
for
walk
away
and
we
absolutely
stuck
with
those
when
the
deal
close
we
immediately
saw
cost
saving
but
more
important
our
increase
control
over
our
beverage
distribution
meant
we
could
grow
our
top
line
by
call
on
more
food
service
account
such
as
restaurant
and
others
who
sell
fountain
drink
we
be
able
to
redirect
the
time
spent
argue
with
the
bottler
toward
innovation
new
marketing
idea
and
sell
our
product
i
learn
plenty
from
this
experience
i
wonder
about
backtracking
on
our
rationale
of
just
ten
year
earlier
when
roger
have
decide
to
separate
the
bottle
asset
into
an
independent
publicly
trade
company
some
observer
saw
a
flip
flop
but
i
didn
t
see
it
that
way
and
perception
wasn
t
go
to
run
the
company
i
have
to
muster
the
courage
to
change
my
mind
when
the
environment
change
and
require
a
different
approach
to
the
business
that
be
leadership

in
my
early
day
as
ceo
if
i
have
a
few
hour
on
any
weekend
i
d
slip
on
my
comfortable
shoe
and
get
in
the
car
i
d
head
somewhere
in
connecticut
or
suburban
new
york
to
community
like
mount
kisco
ridgefield
newburgh
or
new
haven
i
d
pick
a
strip
mall
or
a
main
street
and
enter
a
target
a
stop
shop
supermarket
or
a
family
own
convenience
store
i
be
anonymous
a
random
woman
a
mom
buying
for
her
family
i
knew
every
particular
of
how
store
shelf
come
to
be
stock
and
generally
do
my
own
shopping
near
home
but
i
couldn
t
resist
the
tug
of
a
secret
market
tour
i
d
take
in
the
whole
store
maybe
push
a
cart
pick
out
a
few
item
and
note
the
signage
lobby
display
and
the
other
shopper
by
the
time
i
get
to
the
center
aisle
with
the
bottle
starbucks
frappuccino
the
oat
square
cereal
or
the
sunchips
my
mind
set
be
almost
completely
that
of
a
regular
shopper
i
start
to
notice
the
clutter
in
the
pepsico
section
our
company
be
churn
out
dozen
of
option
lay
s
chip
in
regular
kettle
cooked
lightly
salt
and
oven
bake
quaker
oat
in
quick
roll
instant
and
steel
cut
tropicana
in
original
low
acid
homestyle
and
grovestand
and
all
in
multiple
flavor
or
blend
we
be
absolute
master
of
variety
distribution
and
display
i
kept
ask
myself
what
be
the
unify
message
of
all
those
bright
color
and
loud
logo
how
do
our
product
look
in
pantry
at
home
what
be
right
for
this
neighborhood
s
family
and
what
should
get
the
covet
eye
level
placement
fun
for
you
or
good
for
you
it
bother
me
that
our
shelf
even
when
very
neat
look
a
little
tire
at
the
same
time
i
be
drawn
to
the
upstart
the
simple
bag
of
sea
salt
popcorn
by
regional
brand
or
the
quiet
font
on
bottle
of
artisanal
drink
all
billing
themselves
as
natural
low
calorie
or
preservative
free
i
start
to
see
why
a
young
woman
might
sample
green
tea
kombucha
or
coconut
water
instead
of
pick
up
another

of
diet
pepsi
even
if
we
have
add
a
new
splash
of
lime
the
business
be
in
flux
some
snappy
niche
brand
be
grow
very
fast
but
if
they
couldn
t
expand
they
nose
dive
a
boom

phenomenon
meanwhile
chain
like
kroger
the
big
supermarket
company
in
the
us
be
add
special
health
and
wellness
section
and
i
worried
that
shopper
at
these
chain
wouldn
t
see
our
nutritious
product
elsewhere
in
the
store
i
love
observe
grocery
market
across
the
country
i
once
sat
with
brian
cornell
then
head
of
pepsico
america
food
in
a
car
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
publix
store
near
a
florida
retirement
village
watch
shopper
they
go
in
and
out
of
the
slide
glass
door
some
help
out
of
their
car
at
the
curb
others
steer
motorize
wheelchair
shopping
be
clearly
a
happy
occasion
for
the
old
generation
with
lot
of
greet
and
chat
then
brian
and
i
go
into
the
store
to
see
our
product
on
the
shelf
the
twenty
four
pack
of
pepsi
can
and
aquafina
bottle
how
could
these
people
even
get
these
case
home
i
d
already
be
pester
our
engineer
about
how
tight
the
aquafina
plastic
cap
be
screw
on
the
bottle
and
how
tough
they
be
to
open
even
for
me
after
that
florida
stakeout
i
be
convince
we
need
to
think
more
carefully
about
the
need
of
boomer
and
the
silver
generation
i
later
sent
a
pepsico
team
to
mit
s
agelab
a
center
for
research
on
quality
of
life
for
old
people
from
mit
we
glean
great
insight
on
label
typeface
ergonomics
and
age
american
view
of
a
grocery
shelf
through
all
of
this
i
realize
the
opportunity
and
imperative
of
innovate
for
more
specific
customer
cohort


my
store
outing
often
drew
me
back
to
an
absorb
visit
i
d
have
with
steve
job
in
his
office
at
the
apple
headquarters
in
cupertino
california
in
my
dear
friend
dean
ornish
a
doctor
who
work
on
lifestyle
medicine
and
health
be
close
to
steve
and
broker
our
meeting
i
hadn
t
met
steve
before
and
he
be
incredibly
gracious
we
start
out
talk
about
our
share
vegetarianism
then
he
brought
up
a
few
pepsico
brand
and
i
explain
how
we
be
evolve
the
portfolio
toward
healthier
food
and
reengineering
our
flagship
soda
and
snack
to
cut
the
salt
fat
and
sugar
i
explain
my
idea
around
human
environmental
and
talent
sustainability
steve
say
he
thought
we
should
just
cut
half
the
sugar
from
everything
but
we
d
have
no
company
left
i
say
laugh
the
respectable
formal
food
and
beverage
industry
and
its
long
term
investor
won
t
tolerate
the
high
drama
that
silicon
valley
entrepreneur
pull
off
i
say
besides
people
like
sugar
then
we
talk
about
design
for
two
hour
i
soak
up
steve
s
think
about
inject
great
authentic
design
into
a
company
s
product
and
culture
design
be
how
steve
live
and
how
he
thought
design
be
embed
in
innovation
from
the
start
he
say
and
can
t
come
in
at
the
end
at
apple
design
be
in
everything
steve
worried
about
what
the
new
beautiful
iphone
look
and
felt
like
but
also
about
the
interface
the
accessory
the
store
and
who
might
innovate
to
partner
with
the
company
apple
be
an
experience
user
didn
t
only
see
the
product
he
say
they
be
romance
by
it
design
be
emotional
it
captivates
despite
pepsico
s
stun
ad
campaign
graphic
and
packaging
and
all
our
delicious
ubiquitous
food
and
drink
i
knew
we
be
nowhere
near
this
holistic
approach
to
fitting
it
all
together
design
think
would
need
to
permeate
every
part
of
the
company
it
would
be
a
new
way
of
work
coordinate
across
r
d
marketing
and
advertising
manufacturing
and
distribution
and
involve
far
more
prototyping
and
test
this
would
be
a
radical
change
for
us
the
design
function
have
to
be
nurture
and
protect
steve
say
if
you
don
t
show
ceo
support
don
t
bother
start
on
the
journey
inspire
i
decide
we
have
to
use
design
as
a
critical
differentiator
of
our
product
but
first
i
have
to
understand
the
gap
between
where
we
be
and
where
we
need
to
be
i
give
each
of
my
executive
committee
member
a
copy
of
package
design
now
a
coffee
table
book
full
of
splendid
example
of
great
consumer
product
design
later
that
week
i
ramped
it
up
passing
out
elegant
soft
brown
leather
photo
album
and
ask
them
to
photograph
anything
that
they
be
drawn
to
as
good
design
anything
at
all
i
say
it
could
be
a
chair
a
pencil
a
tea
kettle
they
could
make
collage
of
magazine
image
i
really
didn
t
care
what
it
be
just
think
design
the
album
be
due
back
to
me
in
three
month
this
didn
t
turn
out
well
of
the
fifteen
people
who
get
the
album
one
deliver
outstanding
work
that
she
have
prepared
by
a
professional
agency
a
few
more
turn
in
travel
photo
or
what
appear
to
be
last
minute
shot
of
toothpaste
and
a
mouthwash
bottle
in
their
bathroom
some
men
have
their
wife
prepare
the
album
a
few
blew
it
off
altogether
i
realize
that
design
think
be
almost
nonexistent
among
my
senior
manager
i
set
the
return
album
aside
in
a
cupboard
in
my
office
but
these
idea
linger
in
my
mind


by
i
really
have
my
leg
under
me
as
ceo
pwp
be
our
guide
principle
mehmood
be
building
out
the
science
of
taste
we
d
safely
navigate
through
the
rocky
economy
and
make
some
great
international
acquisition
most
important
we
have
resolve
the
trouble
relationship
with
our
large
north
american
bottler
by
buying
them
back
and
we
could
see
the
gain
we
d
predict
from
that
strategic
move
next
up
i
have
to
contemplate
talent
who
should
lead
big
part
of
our
company
in
the
come
decade
who
should
ultimately
take
my
job
on
average
the
ceo
of
a
us
publicly
trade
company
last
about
five
year
that
s
roughly
the
time
that
roger
and
steve
each
lead
pepsico
i
wasn
t
leave
anytime
soon
but
succession
planning
be
a
fundamental
duty
and
critical
to
my
vision
of
pepsico
as
a
well
oil
organization
that
would
prosper
long
after
i
be
go
every
year
the
board
review
what
would
happen
if
the
ceo
be
hit
by
a
bus
this
be
good
corporate
governance
and
we
take
it
seriously
include
precise
detail
of
the
quick
transition
option
if
i
be
suddenly
not
available
but
we
also
need
a
systematic
and
rigorous
effort
to
develop
the
next
generation
of
c
suite

we

the

pepsico
we
have
a
guidebook
of
sort
over
four
year
i
have
handwritten
and
refine

industry
and
for
our
company
over
several
month
in
late
and
early
i
met
one
on

with
each
of

from
then

out
i

as
i
work
to
redesign
our
organizational
structure
and
develop
new
business
leader
for
a
different
world
ahead
when
the
go
get
tough
i
could
always
refer
back
to
the
reason
we
take
on
even
more
change
the
meticulously
craft
megatrends
research
pepsico
have
long
be
a
decentralize
organization
a
company
with
division
that
want
to
do
their
own
thing
populate
with
energetic
competitive
team
increasingly
though
the
world
demand
that
we
become
a
much
more
networked
company
some
year
earlier
steve
have
built
up
an
important
coordinate
sale
effort
across
snack
and
beverage
for
customer
like
wal
mart
kroger
and
safeway
which
we
call
power
of
one
we
knew
that
get
people
to
buy
more
drink
and
snack
together
would
help
the
whole
company
s
growth
he
go
about
create
power
of
one
customer
team
which
help
pepsico
become
one
of
the
large
supplier
to
almost
every
north
american
retailer
similarly
pepsico
in
europe
get
more
favorable
retailer
status
because
we
come
to
the
table
with
both
beverage
and
snack
line
that
alone
be
not
major
player
in
that
part
of
the
world
i
have
expand
power
of
one
to
more
account
but
we
have
to
take
that
coordinate
view
beyond
sale
to
every
part
of
pepsico
we
need
so
call
center
of
excellence
in
traditional
area
like
operation
dsd
and
consumer
research
we
also
have
to
add
new
area
like
digital
marketing
e
commerce
design
and
artificial
intelligence
in
a
way
that
every
division
and
region
have
access
to
world
class
capability
without
duplicate
effort
we
need
people
to
communicate
and
collaborate
across
every
function
of
the
company
i
decide
to
change
the
lattice
of
title
and
reporting
line
in
our
senior
rank
and
give
more
executive
global
mandate
i
be
help
by
a
few
departure
mike
white
who
be
run
our
non
us
business
left
the
company
to
become
the
ceo
of

i
split
his
job
into
three
richard
goodman
the
cfo
retire
and
hugh
johnston
the

who
d
have
job
in
all
our
north
american
business
take
over
he
turn
out
to
be
a
fantastic
cfo
and
a
great
partner
to
me
that
left
another
senior
opening
we
elevate
more
internal
talent
and
brought
in
a
few
star
from
the
outside
the
people
puzzle
go
on
and
on
our
it
work
which
begin
back
when
frito
lay
s
order
system
crashed
in
help
in
this
transition
too
with
each
go
live
of
new
software
we
have
more
visibility
into
stream
of
information
across
the
company
include
retailer
sale
data
at
our
fingertip
we
could
see
what
product
marketing
or
manufacturing
activity
be
go
on
around
the
world
and
how
effective
they
be
that
become
a
boon
to
efficiency
we
could
take
the
best
idea
from
any
country
revise
it
a
little
if
we
have
to
and
implement
it
elsewhere
this
lift
and
shift
of
idea
and
best
practice
boost
both
revenue
growth
and
profitability
eventually
contribute
to
at
least
billion
in
productivity
gain
over
three
year
all
this
new
collaboration
be
liberate
in
many
way
we
start
use
real
time
data
to
make
quick
decision
and
be
catch
up
to
many
other
company
leverage
similar
system
unfortunately
some
pepsico
old
timer
weren
t
accustom
to
share
much
information
and
struggle
with
what
i
thought
be
a
necessary
refreshingly
open
approach
a
few
senior
executive
and
midlevel
marketing
manager
in
the
us
depart
others
be
let
go
when
they
fail
to
embrace
our
new
process
in
hindsight
i
think
i
kept
some
people
in
job
for
too
long
hop
they
would
improve
or
change
during
a
transformation
as
consequential
as
pwp
though
these
people
can
be
extremely
problematic
i
now
realize
that
it
s
well
to
move
them
out
sooner
rather
than
later
it
be
a
difficult
transition
but
clear
to
everyone
in
the
end
that
these
change
be
essential
and
here
to
stay


in
february
i
announce
my
last
big
strategic
move
to
let
the
pepsico
that
i
envision
for
the
long
run
fly
a
huge
reinvestment
in
our
famous
name
in
the
ballroom
of
the
grand
hyatt
hotel
on
forty
second
street
in
manhattan
just
after
reporting
revenue
of
billion
and
profit
of
billion
i
announce
that
we
d
be
spending
an
additional
million
of
advertising
and
marketing
money
to
boost
our
brand
include
pepsi
cola
and
mountain
dew
this
move
be
directly
related
to
buying
back
our
bottler
we
now
have
more
to
spend
on
pull
in
customer
because
we
no
longer
have
to
fund
the
bottler
demand
for
extra
push
fund
for
five
year
i
have
work
diligently
to
fix
the
underbelly
of
pepsico
and
set
it
up
for
this
moment
but
i
have
also
be
through
wither
criticism
vilified
by
wall
street
analyst
and
the
medium
for
not
pay
more
attention
to
our
short
term
financial
result
and
stock
performance
in
actuality
our
result
be
pretty
good
from
the
end
of
december
to
the
end
of
december
pepsico
s
shareholder
return
be
percent
that
compare
with
the
s
p
index
s
decline
of
percent
in
the
same
period
around
this
time
i
also
have
to
reassure
one
activist
investor
ralph
whitworth
of
relational
investor
who
have
bought
million
of
pepsico
share
think
he
might
be
able
to
influence
us
i
met
with
ralph
in
the
conference
room
of
a
midtown
manhattan
law
firm
surround
by
lawyer
and
men
of
finance
and
listen
carefully
to
his
concern
he
say
he
need
some
clarity
on
why
i
d
bought
back
the
bottler
i
explain
the
strategy
in
detail
ralph
be
smart
and
friendly
and
after
a
couple
of
discussion
he
endorse
our
plan
he
told
me
to
keep
go
he
do
not
want
to
waste
any
more
of
my
time
he
later
sell
his
stock
at
a
profit
and
remain
a
friend
and
a
supporter
until
his
untimely
death
in
september
when
we
announce
the
brand
reboot
with
a
chunk
earmark
for
our
core
beverage
in
north
america
i
be
again
hound
to
some
reporter
and
analyst
this
new
spending
look
like
capitulation
a
reassemble
behind
traditional
soda
brand
that
flew
in
the
face
of
our
push
to
healthier
fare
i
didn
t
see
it
that
way
we
be
drive
a
very
big
car
in
a
very
long
race
and
we
have
to
make
sure
the
engine
be
in
good
shape
pepsi
cola
diet
pepsi
and
mountain
dew
be
critical
the
billion
a
year
soda
market
in
the
us
be
decline
but
we
have
to
remain
competitive
in
that
business
a
profitable
category
that
brought
in
traffic
for
retailer
our
key
competitor
have
increase
advertising
behind
its
soda
brand
and
we
have
to
keep
in
step
the
fun
be
about
to
begin


what
we
didn
t
bargain
for
be
the
fun
that
come
with
our
second
activist
investor
nelson
peltz
of
trian
partner
who
we
learn
have
quietly
bought
up
billion
of
pepsico
stock
a
little
more
than
percent
of
the
company
i
d
know
nelson
socially
for
year
and
one
day
he
be
on
the
phone
indra
indra
indra
i
need
to
see
you
he
declare
he
say
he
d
stop
by
my
home
for
a
quick
meeting
soon
he
present
me
with
a
so
call
white
paper
a
document
prepared
by
his
team
with
all
the
reason
why
pepsico
should
be
split
into
two
piece
each
publicly
trade
i
take
a
copy
of
his
paper
and
assure
him
i
would
read
it
carefully
and
discus
every
aspect
of
it
with
the
board
the
decade
after
the
global
financial
crisis
start
in
be
a
heyday
for
these
kind
of
aggressive
investor
move
activist
fund
pool
of
money
in
search
of
huge
return
pursue
company
with
decent
cash
flow
where
they
thought
they
could
perturb
the
ceo
enough
to
do
their
bidding
activist
don
t
actually
have
to
hold
too
much
of
a
company
s
stock
to
make
it
all
work
they
air
their
grievance
so
publicly
and
often
that
others
invest
along
with
them
i
think
they
also
look
out
for
company
that
be
try
something
new
so
they
can
take
the
credit
if
it
work
out
peltz
be
a
billionaire
expert
at
all
of
this
but
his
plan
for
pepsico
be
aggressive
to
say
the
least
he
want
to
break
up
our
company
into
beverage
and
snack
and
then
merge
the
snack
company
frito
lay
with
mondel
z
the
chicago
base
maker
of
oreo
and
chip
ahoy
cooky
triscuit
cracker
and
cadbury
chocolate
nelson
s
fund
own
about
billion
of
mondel
z
stock
he
say
he
d
float
pepsico
s
beverage
division
as
a
separate
company
every
aspect
of
this
scheme
be
problematic
first
break
up
pepsico
would
destroy
our
very
successful
power
of
one
sale
effort
second
nelson
s
idea
for
frito
lay
to
combine
with
a
cookie
and
chocolate
company
didn
t
make
sense
frito
lay
s
business
grows
because
it
take
market
share
from
sweet
occasion
all
those
time
when
people
reach
for
cooky
and
chocolate
a
company
that
own
a
whole
range
of
both
salty
and
sweet
snack
would
compete
with
itself
it
would
be
a
zero
sum
game
in
addition
break
up
pepsico
would
surely
distract
our
individual
business
and
their
momentum
would
stall
and
frito
lay
and
mondel
z
would
likely
have
to
go
through
a
yearlong
ftc
antitrust
process
with
an
uncertain
outcome
nelson
want
us
to
spend
billion
to
billion
to
do
all
of
this
and
go
through
two
or
three
year
of
chaos
and
disruption
it
would
have
destroyed
the
competitiveness
of
pepsico
our
weaken
company
would
have
be
a
gift
to
our
rival
despite
all
this
pepsico
s
board
of
director
our
senior
leader
and
i
analyze
nelson
s
white
paper
in
great
detail
engage
with
him
respectfully
and
met
with
him
whenever
he
ask
for
time
i
remind
him
that
most
of
my
net
worth
be
tie
up
in
pepsico
share
and
that
i
d
love
to
see
the
stock
soar
if
you
have
a
great
idea
i
d
be
delighted
to
listen
to
it
i
say
but
i
have
no
desire
to
destroy
a
great
company
finally
in
nelson
sell
his
share
at
a
profit
of
more
than
percent
after
recommend
we
add
a
new
board
member
bill
johnson
the
retire

of

the

related
to
our
expand

and
our
millennial

and

fun

meanwhile
i
be
still
think
about
great

and
how
to
move
the
dna
of
the
company
in
that
direction
outside

and
design
operation
set
up
by
many
of
our
country

left
us
with

finally
time
for
world
class
in
house
design
capability
a
beehive
of
artistry
and
critical
think
that
would
work
side
by
side
with
our
marketer
but
also
with
mehmood
s
team
on

to
people
who
i
thought
might
be
sympathetic
to
how
far
we
have
to
go
one
of
those
people
be
brad

later

make
my
point
to
a
team
work
on
a
confidential
project
to
design
a
new
beverage
dispense
machine
brad
and
i
realize
we
have
to
build
an
in
house
design
capacity
fast
we
need
a
strong
collaborative
iconic
leader
for
this
new

after
a
long
search
for
a
permanent

me
to
mauro
porcini

italian
designer

don
t
believe

than

have
ever
walk
into
my
office
i
couldn

take
my
eye
off

slipper
with
red
stone
that
work
elegantly
with
his
eclectic
clothing
and
genial
smile
the
first
time
we
met
mauro
spoke
with
so
much
passion
i
felt
he
understood
exactly
what
i
want
to
do
with
design
give
me
word
that
i
hadn
t
be
able
to
find
i
decide
on
the
spot
that
this
be
the
guy
for
us
i
have
vision
of
the
company

attract

the
world
i
agree

on

the
intersection
with

and

a
truly
virtuous
circle

start
reading
even
more
about
what
design
could
do
for
us
and
then
gladly
agree
to
mauro

suggestion
that

a
fish
out
of
water
in
the
colorful
world
of
global
design
later
i
absorbed

particular
pace
of
the
event
and
just
take
in
as
many
exhibit
as
i
could
i
come

me
to
so
many
people
and
i
begin
to
learn
design
culture
something
very
new
and
very
exhilarate
for
me
i
still
get
goose
bump
when
i
think
about
where
we
come
from
and
where
we
go
with
design
at
pepsico
we
embrace
it
as
a
building
block
of
innovation
shift
our
attention
away
from
just
sell
product
to
create
whole
experience
related
to
our

long
great
partnership
in
both
the
sport

that
we
believe
give
people
immense
moment
of
joy
and
reflect
the
spirit
of
pepsi
we
chose
to
partner
with
league
that
have
annual
season

oppose
to

i
come
to
love
the
game
and
developed
a
great
rapport
with
roger
goodell
the
nfl
commissioner
and
with
several
team
owner
in
i
be
ask
to
speak
at
a
sport
business
journal
conference
in
manhattan
a
talk
i
remember
very
well
for
two
reason
first
i
make
my
long
felt
case
for
how
i
thought
woman
be
ignore
in
sport
marketing
a
topic
i
d
explore
with
the
help
of
jennifer
storm
pepsico
s
senior
vp
of
global
sport
marketing
who
be
always
think
about
how
we
could
leverage
sport
to
build
our
brand
second
adam
silver
then
the
national
basketball
association
s
deputy
commissioner
and
coo
and
now
its
commissioner
be
in
the
audience
i
start
my
speech
show
a
magazine
advertisement
from
the
s
for
heavy
wool
climb
sweater
the
ad
feature
two
strap
gentleman
stand
on
top
of
a
mountain
and
a
woman
below
them
grasp
a
rope
the
copy
read
men
be
well
than
woman
indoors
woman
be
useful
even
pleasant
on
mountain
they
be
something
of
a
drag
of
course
the
world
have
change
i
say
but
the
reality
be
that
sport
marketer
together
with
company
like
ours
still
didn
t
do
much
to
recognize
that
woman
be
athlete
coach
and
genuine
fan
we
have
to
do
more
than
pink
it
and
shrink
it
when
it
come
to
capture
their
heart
and
i
thought
there
be
huge
largely
untapped
potential
in
do
much
more
sophisticated
sport
marketing
to
woman
the
audience
be
rapt
this
be
an
approach
i
don
t
think
the
industry
have
heard
from
a
consumer
package
good
ceo
before
of
course
there
be
probably
no
other
female
ceo
quite
like
me
i
be
a
sport
fan
who
d
receive
dozen
of
football
baseball
and
basketball
jersey
over
the
year
all
customize
with
my
name
and
the
number
on
the
back
and
all
in
enormous
men
s
size
that
i
couldn
t
wear
when
adam
and
i
talk
after
my
speech
he
knew
i
be
look
at
sport
marketing
in
a
broad
and
creative
way
and
he
ask
me
some
very
point
question
culminate
with
why
do
the
nfl
get
so
much
visibility
and
excitement
with
its
beverage
partnership
and
we
don
t
i
told
him
he
be
partner
with
the
wrong
company
aside
from
its
longtime
affiliation
with
gatorade
a
pepsico
brand

be
largely

from

engagement
to
how

more

in

i
watch
game
on
tv
whenever
i
could
and
soon
found
myself
counting
the
minute
that
our
brand
be
on
the
screen
instead
of
keep
track
of
the
play
a
couple
of
time
a
year
i
go
to
game
in
person
and
our
sale
team
would
make
certain
we
have
extra

joe
girardi
then
the
yankee
manager
once
joked
with
me
that
he
might
have
to
take
out
a
player
or
two
to
make
more
room
for
extra
gatorade
cooler
in
the
dugout
in
we
inked
a
partnership
with
the
union
of
european
football
association
uefa
help
lift
brand
marketing
in
european
football
by
add
more
of
the
flash
and
dazzle
that
mark
american
sport
marketing
through
everything
at
work
and
home
my
love
of
sport
have
not
wan
i
be
always
excite
to
go
to
a
few
game
meet
athlete
and
celebrate
the
hard
work
that
be
so
well
exhibit
in
competitive
sport
but
this
wasn
t
all
about
big
league
team
sport
the
bowling
proprietor
association
of
america
a
trade
organization
once
ask
me
to

its
bowl
expo

the
thirty
four
hundred
us
bowling
center
that
belong
to
the
nonprofit
group
true
to
form
i
really
prepared
for
this
talk
i
go
out
bowling
a
few
time
by
myself
to
get
a
sense
of
the
sport
and
the
flavor
of
contemporary
bowling
culture
i
talk
to
the
bowler
and
the
staff
to
understand
the
whole
experience
it
be
useful
two
week
later
i
felt
like
i
could
speak
somewhat
authentically
about
bowling
to
the
la
vega
crowd


after
eight
or
nine
year
in
the
job
i
be
well
know
as
pepsico
s
ceo
the
company
be
do
very
well
and
business
and
functional
leader
want
me
to
do
even
more
outside
the
company
i
met
with
customer
and
become
close
with
more
top
ceo
include
mike
duke
and
then
doug
mcmillon
at
wal
mart
jim
sinegal
at
costco
and
arne
sorenson
at
marriott
we
still
have
independent
bottle
partner
around
the
world
and
they
get
to
know
me
very
well
too
i
think
we
developed
great
respect
for
one
another
i
spoke
at
hundred
of
event
industry
panel
economic
club
woman
s
conference
and
business
school
i
be
a
popular
voice
on
work
life
balance
i
be
also
ask
to
speak
at
corporate
governance
event
and
annual
conference
host
by
big
investor
i
receive
many
leadership
award
and
always
encourage
a
balance
view
of
company
do
well
and
do
good
i
talk
endlessly
about
pwp
i
be
also
press
into
service
to
speak
with
us
state
government
and
others
around
the
world
on
issue
related
to
soda
tax
in
our
own
backyard
michael
bloomberg
the
mayor
of
new
york
city
be
lobbying
to
limit
the
size
of
soda
to
sixteen
ounce
soda
tax
cropped
up
in
other
state
and
area
of
the
world
too
include
california
mexico
and
many
other
part
of
latin
america
and
the
middle
east
we
try
to
make
sure
they
be
sensible
and
suggest
option
such
as
exempt
zero
calorie
drink
and
individual
package
of
few
than
one
hundred
calorie
i
felt
these
tax
be
more
about
the
revenue
they
generate
for
local
municipality
than
limit
sugary
soda
tax
on
plastic
container
also
start
to
emerge
and
we
found
partner
to
develop
close
loop
recycle
system
a
difficult
undertaking
i
try
to
look
at
these
issue
through
the
eye
of
the
community
an
approach
that
give
me
credibility
with
our
critic
much
of
what
i
articulate
with
pwp
be
come
to
pas
with
hit
and
miss
but
with
a
flow
of
enthusiasm
from
pepsico
employee
that
energize
me
we
publish
our
sustainability
report
every
year
and
could
show
the
world
all
the
progress
we
be
make
on
our
various
initiative
i
felt
very
strongly
that
these
report
have
to
be
meticulous
in
their
detail
with
no
waffle
on
how
difficult
it
be
make
real
change
in
these
area
the
integrity
of
our
goal
our
timeline
and
our
reporting
be
absolutely
crucial
to
me
we
have
also
undertaken
a
renovation
of
pepsico
s
headquarters
and
move
out
of
the
building
for
two
year
the
overhaul
let
us
engineer
new
space
and
we
add
an
on
site
childcare
facility
call
pepstart
with
a
special
drop
off
area
outdoor
climb
equipment
and
beautifully
design
infant
and
toddler
space
for
sleep
eat
and
learn
pepstart
rapidly
fill
with
dozen
of
baby
and
kid
under
five
and
a
wait
list
family
paid
for
the
service
but
the
benefit
of
offering
this
convenience
and
peace
of
mind
be
immediate
and
last
we
also
offer
near
site
and
on
site
childcare
in
many
office
around
the
world
and
if
i
have
stayed
longer
at
pepsico
i
would
like
to
have
introduce
this
benefit
at
our
factory
as
well
on
one
hand
i
felt
vindicate
by
all
of
pwp
s
success
on
the
other
i
wish
we
have
move
even
faster
on
some
of
our
sustainability
initiative
interestingly
one
of
the
early
and
most
vocal
detractor
of
all
the
product
change
i
aspire
to
with
pwp
visit
our
office
one
day
and
give
me
a
dvd
about
the
ill
of
sugar
he
told
me
he
d
cut
down
on
his
sugar
intake
massively
i
wish
him
well


as
time
go
on
i
met
many
world
leader
ceo
often
have
perfunctory
photo
ops
with
president
and
prime
minister
but
i
enjoy
lengthy
discussion
with
head
of
government
and
senior
minister
all
over
the
world
i
think
they
appreciate
pepsico
s
investment
in
their
country
and
be
keen
to
work
with
us
as
we
implement
pwp
many
also
be
also
intrigue
that
i
be
a
foreign
born
female
leader
ambitiously
reposition
a
big
american
company
i
hope
that
our
conversation
force
them
to
think
about
how
woman
could
succeed
in
their
company
and
country
too
in
china
i
found
the
leadership
focus
on
agricultural
development
to
keep
their
farmer
viable
in
baotou
inner
mongolia
pepsico
initiate
potato
farm
with
water
efficient
drip
irrigation
system
to
grow
the
potato
we
need
to
make
chip
for
the
country
and
these
farm
also
yield
a
surplus
for
export
the
chinese
leader
want
to
understand
how
to
prolong
the
life
of
agricultural
commodity
as
the
good
travel
across
a
vast
distribution
system
my
trip
to
india
be
fascinate
too
i
always
visit
with
the
prime
minister
and
other
related
ministry
and
be
once
invite
by
the
indian
ambassador
to
the
us
nirupama
rao
to
address
indian
foreign
service
official
in
new
delhi
i
spoke
passionately
about
something
i
strongly
believe
that
ambassador
and
consul
general
have
to
expand
their
effort
to
focus
on
economic
diplomacy
as
a
key
pillar
of
their
political
diplomacy
this
be
the
first
time
they
have
invite
a
global
ceo
to
address
them
and
i
give
them
a
lot
to
think
about
i
often
remind
myself
that
i
make
these
fascinate
contact
and
receive
these
invitation
because
of
my
position
and
that
my
friend
list
would
shrink
when
i
retire
a
few
relationship
evolve
from
positional
to
personal
but
not
too
many

ceo
open
door
in
the
most
dazzle
way

do
it
because
they
be
nice
people
it
s
about
what
you
can
do
for
them
i
be
also
very
conscious
whenever
i
get
off
the
plane
in
an
unfamiliar
place
that
i
have
to
think

breathtaking
at

i
ask

simple
question

girl
in
my
arm
they
just
want
a
parental
embrace
they
be
reluctant
to
let
go
i
be
overcome
with
emotion


so
what
about
my
personal
life
tara
go
off
to
college
in
new
york
city
and
preetha
graduate
from
yale
som
and
start
a
new
job
raj
become
an
independent
consultant
help
large
company
develop
next
generation
supply
chain
solution
i
still
head
home
from
the
office
almost
every
day
with
three
bag
of
correspondence
and
other
document
to
read
some
people
at
work
openly
call
me
the
bag
lady
and
one
executive
jokingly
remark
that
i
carry
those
canvas
sack
for
show
i
recently
get
a
letter
from
him
now
the
ceo
of
a
major
us
company
tell
me
he
be
think
about
me
as
he
head
home
with
his
three
bag
of
reading
material
i
also
have
more
report
and
article
to
review
than
ever
because
trend
in
technology
and
geopolitics
be
evolve
so
fast
there
really
be
no
choice
when
i
start
at
pepsico
i
remember
one
senior
leader
tell
people
the
distance
between
number
one
and
number
two
be
a
constant
he
meant
that
when
a
leader
overperforms
the
team
come
along
with
him
or
her
when
the
leader
underperforms
the
same
thing
happens
i
take
that
to
heart
if
i
want
pepsico
to
develop
to
be
an
inform
curious
organization
then
i
as
ceo
have
to
always
exhibit
those
quality
myself
i
also
love
the
intellectual
stimulation
of
all
that
reading
and
correspondence
with
raj
and
i
as
empty
nester
i
begin
to
focus
a
bit
more
on
myself
i
start
play
tennis
at
the
grand
slam
tennis
club
in
banksville
new
york
twice
a
week
at
a
m
my
coach
nesar
nayak
patiently
accommodate
my
early
start
and
many
schedule
change
i
sign
up
for
individual
ballroom
dance
lesson
just
to
learn
something
different
from
the
indian
tradition
i
be
brought
up
in
and
to
enjoy
the
movement
and
music
in
a
calm
private
way
my
instructor
john
campbell
a
british
dancer
in
his
thirty
start
out
rather
scar
of
me
the
ceo
who
want
to
learn
the
waltz
and
the
fox
trot
he
be
also
very
patient
and
once
we
have
work
together
for
a
while
boldly
told
me
as
we
dance
together
my
job
be
to
lead
and
yours
be
to
follow
sometimes
if
you
learn
to
follow
you
will
be
a
well
leader
i
ve
take
this
great
advice
to
heart
in
many
circumstance
i
add
some
daily
exercise
on
pepsico
s
campus
too
i
start
walk
on
the
roadway
around
the
building
a
mile
loop
and
finally
i
take
the
time
to
explore
the
garden
and
wood
and
to
admire
the
sculpture
i
get
to
know
the
golden
path


at
some
point
in
my
ceo
year
i
also
learn
about
the
power
of
look
the
part
for
a
long
time
i
have
paid
little
attention
to
my
wardrobe
i
work
with
men
and
they
wore
gray
and
blue
suit
with
collar
shirt
i
do
too
i
felt
self
conscious
about
my
leg
which
i
thought
be
too
skinny
and
chose
long
skirt
to
cover
them
up
i
didn
t
buy
inexpensive
clothes
and
i
appreciate
fine
fabric
i
shop
at
richards
on
greenwich
avenue
an
elegant
store
that
begin
as
an
exclusive
men
s
suit
shop
and
then
add
a
woman
s
section
i
usually
chose
a
lovely
wool
suit
with
wide
leg
trouser
and
disregard
urge
from
scott
mitchell
one
of
the
partner
at
richards
for
me
to
update
my
style
have
the
tailor
fashion
the
trouser
into
a
skirt
i
select
functional
shoe
with
small
heel
but
no
color
pointy
toe
bow
or
buckle
then
in
a
peculiar
and
wonderful
episode
a
young
freelance
consultant
name
gordon
stewart
ask
permission
to
speak
to
me
privately
we
d
met
briefly
at
a
gatorade
new
product
showcase
i
didn
t
know
him
but
i
agree
to
a
quick
chat
gordon
told
me
that
i
need
a
sartorial
makeover
and
that
he
have
idea
to
help
me
he
ask
me
to
meet
him
at
the
saks
fifth
avenue
club
a
private
shopping
area
in
the
manhattan
department
store
on
the
follow
saturday
morning
at
eleven
i
be
not
offend
by
his
comment
or
offer
of
help
i
be
embarrass
intrigue
and
nervous
i
accepted
his
invitation
that
weekend
i
take
the
elevator
to
the
fifth
floor
at
saks
where
gordon
greet
me
he
take
me
to
a
large
dress
room
where
dress
skirt
jacket
shoe
bag
and
jewelry
for
me
to
consider
be
arrayed
on
the
wall
all
exquisite
all
coordinate
very
professional
my
first
response
be
that
i
wouldn
t
try
on
the
dress
and
skirt
because
they
be
knee
length
too
short
but
gordon
would
not
give
up
he
coaxed
me
to
put
them
on
and
slowly
i
come
around
to
his
point
of
view
it
cost
me
quite
a
bit
to
give
away
the
old
and
restock
my
wardrobe
but
add
all
this
color
and
style
give
me
a
newfound
confidence
which
i
carry
with
me
even
now
occasionally
i
go
back
and
look
at
the
look
book
that
gordon
put
together
his
courage
and
attention
to
detail
left
an
indelible
mark
to
match
all
these
new
clothes
i
also
start
to
listen
to
my
patient
longtime
hairdresser
anna
magnotta
i
agree
to
blow
dry
my
hair
the
way
she
want
me
to
and
boy
do
this
help
my
overall
appearance
strangely
i
get
firsthand
affirmation
that
change
my
look
make
a
difference
in
the
boardroom
too
i
start
wear
nicely
tailor
dress
and
jacket
with
pearl
and
maybe
a
scarf
to
work
every
day
at
the
end
of
one
board
meeting
one
of
our
male
director
write
me
that
ever
since
i
change
my
clothing
he
found
me
more
intimidate
i
didn
t
quite
know
how
to
interpret
that
remark
except
perhaps
to
infer
that
clothes
might
make
a
woman
too


in
i
told
the
board
that
i
thought
we
should
start
narrow
the
list
of
who
would
become
pepsico
s
next
ceo
i
think
ceo
usually
leave
because
they
be
tire
they
want
to
do
something
else
or
the
board
want
them
out
i
be
start
to
feel
that
exhaustion
and
be
think
about
my
future
but
i
also
felt
good
about
how
the
company
be
do
and
i
knew
we
have
built
an
amaze
roster
of
senior
executive
who
could
take
over
around
that
time
i
move
four
key
candidate
into
expand
assignment
to
get
to
know
new
part
of
the
company
a
year
or
so
later
with
the
help
of
ruth
fattori
then
our
head
of
hr
i
give
our
director
curated
dossier
on
each
of
the
four
include
detailed
performance
appraisal
from
the
past
five
year
and
note
on
their
long
and
impressive
career
an
organizational
psychologist
provide
a
summary
report
on
the
arc
of
development
for
each
candidate
i
ask
the
board
to
meet
each
of
them
separately
and
to
watch
them
in
action
in
their
business
ruth
and
i
would
enable
all
this
i
say
but
i
would
not
give
my
opinion
on
who
should
take
over
that
decision
be
up
to
the
board
lead
by
the
unflappable
preside
director
ian
cook
the
board
handle
the
job
diligently
even
hire
an
external
firm
to
conduct
an
independent

of
each
candidate
all
four

in
their
own
way
in
early
august
ian
told
me
that
the
board

picked
ramon
laguarta
to
be

him
of
the
board

the
other
three

tougher

away
two

a
true
loss
for
the

the
best
ex
ceo
for

discreet

around
if
necessary
but
the
company
be
now
his
to
shape
really
during
those
slow
october
day
i
be
catch
my
breath
contemplate
the
past
think
about
the
future
and
brimming
with
gratitude
one
afternoon
i
read
the
entire
fifty
year
of
pep
a
storied
past
a
promising
future
a
page
book
i
have
commission
but
never
have
the
chance
to
open
another
day
i
linger
over
a
beautiful
scrapbook
assemble
by
jon
banner
our
head
of
communication
detail
my
twelve
year
journey
as
ceo
with
fact
photograph
and
testimonial
it
sure
brought
a
lump
to
my
throat
i
look
at
the
hundred
of
thank
you
note
and
goodbye
i
d
receive
i
leafed
through
annual
report
and
reread
each
one
of
the
shareholder
letter
i
d
write
on
pepsico
s
progress
i
have
spent
hour
every
year
sweat
over
those
letter
i
be
happy
i
do
together
they
do
an
amaze
job
recount
the
company
s
transformation
i
also
flip
through
the
many
photo
album
of
my
travel
and
thought
about
the
people
i
d
met
the
culture
i
d
experienced
and
the
opportunity
and
challenge
still
ahead
in
so
many
country


none
of
these
letter
or
book
of
course
show
the
frustration
and
indignation
of
the
job
but
i
reminisce
about
those
too
the
activist
the
quarterly
earnings
pressure
pepsico
executive
resistance
to
change
the
passive
aggressive
behavior
direct
at
me
so
many
conflict
agenda
how
do
i
cope
with
it
indeed
the
thousand
of
small
decision
that
pwp
entail
include
both
the
victory
and
misfire
didn
t
happen
without
plenty
of
concern
about
whether
we
could
do
it
all
but
i
have
commit
to
this
massive
transformation
and
just
as
have
happen
when
i
arrive
in
calcutta
with
the
weight
of
my
family
s
expectation
on
me
i
have
to
stick
with
it
no
matter
what
i
have
heard
of
and
see
male
ceo
yell
throw
thing
and
use
four
letter
word
with
great
gusto
apparently
a
sign
of
their
passion
and
commitment
but
i
be
well
aware
that
show
any
of
these
emotion
myself
would
set
me
back
with
the
people
around
me
so
on
day
that
i
be
mad
that
people
both
inside
and
outside
the
company
didn
t
quite
get
what
i
be
try
to
do
i
d
go
into
the
little
bathroom
attach
to
my
office
look
at
myself
in
the
mirror
and
just
let
it
all
out
and
when
the
moment
have
pass
i
d
wipe
my
tear
reapply
a
little
makeup
square
my
shoulder
and
walk
back
out
into
the
fray
ready
again
to
be
it


only
one
thing
about
leave
pepsico
really
nag
at
me
so
much
discussion
of
my
departure
focus
on
how
i
didn
t
leave
the
company
to
another
woman
a
new
york
time
story
be
headline
when
a
female
ceo
leaf
the
glass
ceiling
be
restore
ugh
of
all
those
powerful
men
who
retire
every
year
where
be
the
article
about
why
their
successor
isn
t
a
woman
the
number
of
female
ceo
in
the
fortune
rise
from
ten
in
to
thirty
two
in
and
then
thirty
seven
in
we
ve
only
move
from
less
than
percent
woman
ceo
in
the
fortune
to
percent
over
twenty
seven
year
progress
on
this
issue
it
seem
to
me
should
not
be
about
celebrate
gain
or
lament
loss
when
the
number
of
woman
at
the
top
of
large
company
be
still
abysmally
low
we
need
woman
in
equal
decision
make
role
in
this
world
because
woman
be
half
the
population
more
female
leader
will
mean
a
healthier
wealthier
more
egalitarian
society
i
also
believe
that
we
get
the
best
decision
when
people
with
different
experience
come
together
to
hash
out
the
detail
and
that
true
leadership
require
learn
from
diverse
team
like
family
this
be
messy
there
s
no
doubt
that
it
s
easy
to
run
a
company
or
a
government
when
the
people
in
the
room
come
from
the
same
social
background
approach
problem
the
same
way
and
reach
consensus
fairly
smoothly
but
easy
doesn
t
mean
well
writ
large
half
the
company
out
there
and
of
the
big
should
be
run
by
woman
at
the
pace
we
be
move
now
this
will
absurdly
take
more
than
year
my
successor
ramon
laguarta
join
pepsico
in
lead
the
wimm
bill
dann
deal
and
integration
in
russia
and
serve
as
ceo
of
pepsico
in
europe
and
sub
saharan
africa
he
work
in
five
country
and
his
wife
and
three
son
move
around
with
him
in
i
promote
him
to
president
of
pepsico
and
he
move
to
purchase
to
get
more
exposure
to
how
the
whole
company
work
the
board
select
ramon
after
a
rigorous
process
that
prioritize
pepsico
s
long
term
vision
the
fact
that
none
of
the
final
four
people
interviewed
to
follow
me
as
ceo
be
a
woman
wasn
t
because
we
ignore
the
need
for
more
female
ceo
it
s
just
that
despite
year
of
effort
we
weren
t
there
yet
this
be
particularly
related
to
two
heart
wrench
issue
first
several
high
potential
woman
whom
i
mentor
move
around
for
the
right
job
and
introduce
to
the
board
over
the
year
become
chief
executive
and
chief
operating
officer
but
they
left
pepsico
to
do
it
these
executive
train
in
our
exceptional
talent
academy
drew
the
attention
of
recruiter
and
the
board
of
small
company
i
be
proud
of
them
but
upset
that
we
d
lose
them
perhaps
it
be
the
right
move
the
competition
to
lead
pepsico
such
an
enormous
enterprise
be
a
long
shot
for
anyone
second
i
know
some
up
and
come
woman
move
on
because
of
how
they
be
manage
in
their
midlevel
job
one
way
i
recognize
this
happen
be
when
i
listen
to
the
performance
appraisal
of
the
top
two
hundred
people
in
the
company
i
be
in
on
them
because
we
paid
attention
to
rise
leader
as
part
of
the
talent
pillar
of
pwp
with
a
special
focus
on
woman
and
other
diverse
talent
i
notice
that
when
a
male
manager
be
evaluate
the
talk
would
go
like
this
he
do
a
good
job
deliver
on
most
of
his
objective
and
and
then
some
detail
about
this
man
s
terrific
potential
a
woman
s
evaluation
would
get
a
different
twist
she
do
a
great
job
deliver
on
all
of
her
objective
but
and
then
some
detail
about
some
kind
of
issue
or
personality
problem
that
might
derail
her
future
success
the
and
but
phenomenon
bother
me
tremendously
many
time
i
stop
and
ask
manager
point
question
do
you
give
her
timely
feedback
do
you
get
her
the
right
help
to
address
these
issue
i
often
sent
manager
back
and
ask
them
to
make
it
work
with
female
executive
x
this
be
not
always
a
win
proposition
sometimes
these
manager
change
their
view
but
many
stuck
to
their
gun
about
the
people
work
for
them
men
and
woman
and
i
can
t
say
they
be
always
wrong
at
the
same
time
i
know
we
lose
smart
hardworking
female
executive
at
pepsico
for
reason
undoubtedly
related
to
how
men
and
woman
be
perceive
differently


so
many
woman
in
today
s
workplace
have
extraordinary
skill
intelligence
ambition
creativity
determination
and
good
cheer
they
be
valedictorian
and
graduate
with
top
grade
from
competitive
school
they
have
overcome
adversity
they
have
sacrifice
and
work
incredibly
hard
they
be
hungry
to
be
financially
self
sufficient
we
no
longer
need
to
make
the
case
for
why
woman
be
so
great
as
contributor
to
the
bottom
line
they
just
be
there
be
no
single
reason
why
more
woman
don
t
lead
big
company
there
be
no
list
of
ten
item
that
simply
need
fix
there
be
hundred
of
issue
some
tiny
and
difficult
to
pinpoint
and
some
huge
and
structural
that
add
up
to
make
it
so
despite
all
the
progress
we
have
make
the
modern
workplace
be
still
replete
with
damage
custom
and
behavior
that
hold
woman
back
this
be
gender
bias
and
it
affect
every
woman
s
success
in
some
case
woman
make
the
completely
rational
choice
to
move
on
or
try
something
different
to
pay
their
bill
in
other
case
this
bias
just
grind
away
at
their
confidence
which
then
affect
their
competence
and
at
some
point
attack
their
performance
i
think
many
people
get
caught
in
this
doom
loop
bias
also
press
many
woman
with
child
or
even
those
think
about
have
a
family
to
feel
mightily
conflict
about
stick
with
their
job
at
all
a
woman
must
contend
with
all
that
subtle
prejudice
in
the
workplace
and
in
the
us
at
least
a
largely
ad
hoc
support
structure
for
take
care
of
child
until
they
be
eligible
to
start
public
school
at
age
five
many
woman
end
up
choose
if
they
can
afford
it
to
drop
out
of
the
paid
labor
force
some
hope
to
return
one
day
but
concede
that
they
won
t
jump
back
onto
a
train
to
the
very
top
some
call
this
a
leaky
pipeline
although
i
think
that
kind
of
language
downplays
the
problem
the
pipeline
be
way
beyond
leaky
it
be
broken
in
any
event
we
still
have
relatively
few
woman
with
the
experience
and
fortitude
to
be
consider
for
the
position
of
ceo
of
a
multibillion
dollar
enterprise
this
be
a
real
issue
because
we
be
just
not
enable
so
many
talented
young
woman
to
achieve
their
full
potential
a
loss
for
the
overall
economy


i
be
always
aware
that
woman
in
the
corporate
world
be
climb
a
steeper
more
slippery
ladder
than
the
men
i
think
back
to
my
day
at
bcg
when
one
partner
would
never
make
eye
contact
with
me
he
spoke
to
me
look
squarely
at
the
men
on
our
team
as
a
young
consultant
i
wonder
what
put
him
off
my
wardrobe
my
look
something
else
year
later
a
colleague
casually
told
me
that
he
behave
that
way
with
all
the
woman
and
people
of
color
similarly
umpteen
time
over
the
year
i
be
address
as
babe
and
sweetie
and
honey
i
put
up
with
it
until
i
finally
felt
i
have
enough
power
in
the
job
marketplace
to
take
a
stand
with
the
new
bos
at
abb
and
just
leave
even
when
i
be
on
the
very
top
rung
i
be
still
on
the
woman
s
ladder
as
pepsico
s
chairman
for
a
dozen
year
i
lead
our
board
meeting
sit
at
the
head
of
a
large
u
shape
conference
table
in
a
sunny
corner
room
on
we
be
eight
men
and
four
woman
the
meeting
would
begin
with
friendly
greeting
and
then
get
down
to
business
we
analyze
performance
risk
strategy
talent
and
what
we
saw
across
the
world
i
be
lucky
to
work
with
a
supportive
board
but
some
of
the
comment
in
public
and
private
by
a
board
member
or
two
be
rude
and
patronize
remark
i
imagine
they
wouldn
t
dare
make
to
a
male
leader
additionally
i
have
put
up
with
a
couple
of
the
men
think
it
be
ok
to
talk
over
me
or
interrupt
me
midsentence
i
found
this
simply
unacceptable
and
try
not
to
stew
about
it
once
sharon
rockefeller
who
be
a
valuable
board
member
for
almost
thirty
year
have
have
enough
i
watch
her
tell
one
of
the
men
that
his
behavior
of
interrupt
her
constantly
have
to
stop
she
be
direct
firm
and
public
everyone
get
the
message
every
board
need
a
sharon
rockefeller
another
board
member
early
in
my
day
as
ceo
insist
on
a
one
on
one
meeting
with
me
every
six
week
or
so
almost
always
require
me
to
travel
to
his
home
city
to
see
him
he
d
ask
me
question
and
my
answer
be
always
greet
with
i
wouldn
t
say
it
that
way
i
d
then
politely
ask
for
his
suggest
response
hop
to
learn
something
he
d
almost
always
repeat
verbatim
what
i
d
just
say
i
view
this
as
a
funny
power
game
he
be
a
newly
retire
senior
business
executive
who
be
struggle
with
give
up
his
position
of
power
he
want
to
retain
his
influence
through
me
it
drove
me
crazy
i
view
these
dinner
as
a
waste
of
my
time
when
i
be
rise
in
pepsico
like
many
female
senior
executive
i
be
also
the
only
woman
in
the
room
when
our
management
team
sat
around
debate
tactic
i
be
always
well
prepared
and
offer
good
insight
and
i
know
i
be
respect
but
quite
often
when
i
make
suggestion
someone
would
jump
in
and
say
oh
no
indra
that
s
too
theoretical
a
few
minute
later
a
man
would
suggest
the
exact
same
thing
use
the
same
word
and
be
congratulate
for
his
terrific
insightful
idea
i
once
lean
over
to
a
senior
operating
executive
and
loudly
ask
him
to
bring
up
a
thought
of
mine
otherwise
it
will
be
view
as
too
theoretical
i
quipped
that
end
the
too
theoretical
comment
i
really
didn
t
think
i
could
do
all
that
much
about
how
people
treat
me
personally
but
i
always
try
to
support
woman
in
the
organization
i
make
sure
my
corporate
strategy
team
be
as
good
as
it
could
be
and
it
end
up
percent
female
i
held
many
woman
only
town
hall
to
let
female
employee
talk
about
anything
on
their
mind
i
quietly
spoke
with
some
about
how
they
present
themselves
from
how
they
sat
in
meeting
to
how
they
communicate
their
idea
most
take
my
feedback
and
act
on
it
a
few
thought
i
be
too
conservative
and
push
back
although
everyone
accepted
that
i
have
their
best
interest
at
heart
i
also
weigh
in
with
a
female
perspective
on
marketing
and
advertising
campaign
one
diet
pepsi
tv
commercial
in
the
s
stick
in
my
mind
the
set
be
a
fancy
wedding
with
the
bridesmaid
and
guest
wait
around
something
have
go
wrong
one
woman
tell
another
that
the
bride
s
diamond
be
small
and
then
it
becomes
clear
that
the
groom
isn
t
show
up
the
resplendent
bride
be
cry
her
father
give
her
a
diet
pepsi
she
sip
she
pep
up
she
look
at
her
dad
and
say
this
be
diet
i
saw
this
ad
in
an
internal
screen
and
told
the
creator
that
i
didn
t
think
it
would
encourage
woman
to
drink
diet
pepsi
because
it
be
insult
none
of
the
men
agree
and
they
be
furious
that
i
weigh
in
note
that
this
wasn
t
my
responsibility
the
campaign
go
ahead
later
a
few
of
those
guy
actively
avoid
talk
to
me
about
the
number
when
diet
pepsi
have
a
disappoint

i
make
one
more
memorable
very
visible

the
beautiful
french
cobblestone
on
the
walkway
between

improve
immeasurably
for
woman
in
the
us
since
i
be
a
sari
clad
intern
at
booz
allen
hamilton
and
be
content
to
stay
out

be
the
legacy
of
decade
of
work
by
woman
like
ruth
bader
ginsburg
gloria
steinem
and
shirley
chisholm
and
by
the
feminist
movement
more
recently
the
metoo
movement
and
time
s
up
campaign
have
have
a
profound
impact
on
expose
the
degree
to
which
woman
be
subject
to
sexual
violence
and
harassment
the
movement
and
campaign
have
create
a
necessary
community
for
survivor
i
be
never
sexually
assault
i
do
witness
and
hear
about
plenty
of
male
behavior
early
in
my
day
in
the
corporate
world
that
offend
my
sense
of
decency
and
my
value
i
later
make
it
a
priority
to
shut
down
offensive
behavior
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
or
it
become
know
after
i
become
pepsico
s
president
i
instruct
our
compliance
department
to
address
harassment
complaint
make
to
our
anonymous
speak
up
line
immediately
we
be
quick
to
fire
confirm
harasser
the
number
of
sexual
harassment
complaint
fell
although
i
still
worried
about
whether
woman
held
off
call
the
speak
up
line
for
fear
of
retaliation


when
i
craft
pwp
i
knew
the
talent
piece
be
the
easy
to
conceive
and
would
be
the
hardest
to
execute
i
want
pepsico
to
be
a
phenomenal
place
to
work
i
want
our
associate
to
both
make
a
living
and
have
a
life
and
for
everyone
to
be
respect
as
individual
at
the
same
time
our
talent
related
action
have
to
be
measurable
and
related
to
pepsico
s
business
outcome
so
here
be
my
plan
we
d
do
the
basic
very
well
hire
the
best
without
discriminate
give
these
people
the
right
assignment
stretch
them
mentor
them
pay
them
fairly
celebrate
them
give
them
useful
feedback
promote
them
when
they
show
great
result
move
them
out
if
they
didn
t
perform
and
make
sure
they
didn
t
confront
conscious
or
unconscious
bias
along
the
way
in
addition
and
this
come
from
my
own
heart
we
d
ask
everyone
to
remember
that
employee
be
mother
father
daughter
and
son
when
we
hire
a
person
we
hire
the
family
behind
that
person
too
each
employee
have
to
be
treat
with
an
emotional
connection
i
say
there
be
no
managerial
formula
that
will
do
for
everyone
but
we
also
need
universal
support
system
needle
to
say
it
be
not
easy
i
be
lucky
that
steve
reinemund
have
haul
diversity
and
inclusion
into
pepsico
s
executive
suite
when
he
become
ceo
in
company
at
that
time
saw
the
dearth
of
woman
and
people
of
color
in
their
management
rank
but
few
do
much
about
it
steve
thought
our
employee
base
should
reflect
our
consumer
base
and
insist
we
recruit
and
promote
diverse
candidate
at
every
level
of
management
he
be
convince
that
we
need
critical
mass
to
truly
change
our
culture
and
demonstrate
the
value
of
diversity
he
create
advisory
board
to
guide
us
on
african
american
and
hispanic
advancement
and
brought
in
actor
to
dramatize
behavior
in
the
workplace
so
that
manager
could
realize
what
bias
in
action
be
all
about
this
be
well
before
the
ubiquitous
bias
training
program
we
see
now
steve
also
link
executive
bonus
to
diversity
and
inclusion
metric
he
upset
some
senior
manager
who
felt
they
already
have
enough
to
do
meeting
their
sale
target
but
he
stuck
with
it
we
make
good
progress
on
representation
between
and
the
number
of
woman
in
management
position
rise
from
around
percent
to
almost
percent
i
need
to
tie
steve
s
initiative
to
pwp
and
take
his
effort
far
we
start
examine
hr
process
to
make
sure
every
person
be
get
an
equal
chance
for
progress
we
found
for
example
that
many
employee
weren
t
get
honest
properly
document
performance
appraisal
in
a
timely
way
so
we
add
training
program
on
how
to
do
this
i
begin
to
scrutinize
end
of
the
year
evaluation
to
ensure
manager
take
the
time
to
ass
and
document
each
person
s
contribution
i
also
challenged
our
hire
process
when
no
woman
or
minority
candidate
be
consider
for
many
job
one
particular
incident
still
make
me
shake
my
head
we
need
a
new
cfo
for
pepsico
india
and
the
hire
manager
be
speak
to
male
candidate
only
when
i
ask
why
they
wouldn
t
be
move
heaven
and
earth
to
look
at
the
entire
pool
of
candidate
and
maybe
find
a
woman
for
the
job
give
that
there
be
no
woman
yet
in
the
pepsico
india
c
suite
the
answer
be
a
stunner
if
it
s
a
woman
she
ll
end
up
leave
if
her
husband
get
move
i
be
told
we
can
t
take
that
chance
then
i
ask
why
the
previous
cfo
have
quit
he
be
move
because
his
wife
just
get
a
big
promotion
we
hire
kimsuka
narasimhan
as
cfo
of
pepsico
india
she
be
an
outstanding
choice


while
i
be
ceo
i
built
on
all
the
family
friendly
policy
in
place
we
increase
paid
maternity
leave
to
up
to
twelve
week
and
wherever
possible
add
on

or
near

childcare
on

medical
facility
private
space
for
breast
feed
and
a
healthy
pregnancy
program
we
also
create
the
company
s
first
global
flexible
work
arrangement
employee
be
grateful
that
we
didn
t
cut
these
program
when
we
be
look
for
cost
saving
our
organizational
health
score
improve
a
lot
percent
of
pepsico
employee
answer
that
they
be
satisfied
with
the
company
as
a
place
to
work
by
the
time
i
left
up
from
percent
when
i
take
over
many
pepsico
employee
cheer
our
talent
initiative
others
thought
our
associate
personal
life
be
their
own
business
and
we
shouldn
t
be
quite
so
generous
i
couldn
t
quibble
with
either
response
but
i
didn
t
change
my
agenda
i
be
happy
with
our
progress
for
me
personally
there
be
also
a
more
painful
criticism
that
come
through
when
we
ask
for
feedback
she
only
care
about
people
like
her
that
be
woman
and
people
of
color
i
knew
i
have
be
refer
to
as
a
quota
hire
when
i
join
pepsico
in
imply
that
i
be
only
hire
because
i
be
a
woman
of
color
but
i
really
thought
i
have
pretty
much
prove
myself
now
when
i
step
up
to
champion
diversity
and
inclusion
my
ethnicity
and
gender
be
front
and
center
some
incident
related
to
this
sentiment
gall
me
if
an
indian
american
be
hire
into
pepsico
north
america
in
a
management
job
for
instance
it
get
back
to
me
that
people
say
this
must
be
indra
s
contact
when
a
woman
or
person
of
color
be
promote
it
be
common
to
hear
it
must
be
her
focus
on
diversity
and
inclusion
our
it
department
once
outsource
work
to
an
indian
company
that
be
do
similar
project
for
many
us
client
a
tiny
contract
that
i
knew
nothing
about
someone
call
the
speak
up
line
to
complain
that
the
job
go
to
my
relative
sometimes
i
felt
like
people
assume
that
everyone
from
india
all
billion
people
be
my
cousin
or
somehow
related
to
me
it
be
dishearten
but
amuse
in
its
own
disturb
way


diversity
and
inclusion
be
here
to
stay
and
corporate
leader
need
to
get
use
to
the
concept
as
a
major
business
driver
some
senior
manager
talk
about
talent
and
then
say
they
look
forward
to
the
day
when
they
don
t
have
to
worry
about
diversity
and
inclusion
because
the
problem
be
solve
i
don
t
see
this
happen
anytime
soon
as
long
as
we
keep
grow
compete
and
move
toward
the
idea
that
the
economy
belongs
to
everyone
we
will
be
work
on
this
i
do
believe
however
that
some
of
our
idea
on
how
to
address
bias
should
evolve
i
wonder
for
instance
if
appoint
a
diversity
and
inclusion
vice
president
alone
be
the
right
approach
diversity
and
inclusion
cannot
simply
be
delegate
to
one
individual
that
be
a
cop
out
it
should
be
on
the
ceo
s
plate
as
a
priority
and
central
to
the
hr
agenda
not
something
that
ebb
and
flow
with
the
quality
of
a
diversity
and
inclusion
leader
human
resource
in
turn
can
t
be
shy
about
the
challenge
cover
any
of
this
up
be
building
a
house
on
a
weak
foundation
it
doesn
t
work
far
the
tone
at
the
top
of
any
division
or
work
group
be
critical
we
need
training
that
say
to
a
broad
swath
of
leader
and
manager
how
do
you
make
sure
the
organization
be
welcome
to
talented
qualify
people
of
all
kind
along
with
the
obvious
goal
of
fairness
it
just
make
business
sense
talent
drive
performance
and
it
take
so
much
time
and
money
to
hire
people
and
train
them
why
not
do
all
we
can
do
to
hire
the
best
from
the
whole
population
include
them
and
help
them
succeed
leader
must
then
model
the
behavior
themselves
there
can
be
no
tacit
acceptance
of
stereotypically
bias
behavior
and
in
my
view
it
need
to
be
call
out
when
it
happens
when
you
see
people
talk
over
anyone
especially
minority
voice
who
face
this
regularly
stop
it
when
you
see
a
woman
be
put
down
stop
it
i
firmly
believe
this
can
be
do
artfully
and
effectively
and
do
it
set
the
tone
we
don
t
tolerate
negative
discriminate
behavior
against
our
daughter
or
sister
or
wife
why
do
we
allow
it
in
the
workplace
direct
at
woman
who
be
daughter
and
sister
themselves
company
should
also
rethink
how
to
deliver
bias
training
in
the
early
day
many
company
insist
on
across
the
board
diversity
training
for
all
employee
we
need
to
create
awareness
in
generation
of
employee
who
perhaps
didn
t
grow
up
in
very
diverse
environment
now
we
have
millennials
and
gen
zers
who
be
far
more
accustom
to
work
in
diverse
group
when
they
walk
in
the
door
unconscious
bias
still
need
attention
but
talk
about
it
must
be
super
relevant
and
tailor
to
the
audience
for
us
to
move
forward
i
also
believe
that
board
of
director
could
play
a
more
significant
role
in
stamp
out
bias
and
create
an
inclusive
environment
first
board
must
select
ceo
base
on
their
ability
and
desire
to
hire
and
get
the
best
out
of
a
diverse
workforce
then
those
director
should
hold
their
ceo
accountable
and
once
a
year
dedicate
time
to
a
comprehensive
discussion
on
issue
related
to
bias
inclusion
and
sexual
harassment
in
the
company
director
should
also
review
organizational
health
survey
to
ensure
the
right
question
be
be
ask
and
to
make
sure
all
result
be
analyze
by
gender
and
ethnicity
most
important
board
must
show
genuine
care
for
and
intent
about
this
topic
if
it
be
view
as
yet
another
item
on
a
long
list
of
corporate
governance
change
it
will
never
result
in
meaningful
progress
i
also
believe
ceo
and
board
have
to
finally
step
up
on
pay
parity
we
all
know
that
woman
on
average
be
paid
less
for
the
same
work
as
men
this
be
a
travesty
and
we
need
a
far
more
precise
effort
to
resolve
the
discrepancy
some
company
be
now
publicly
reveal
their
pay
disparity
put
their
own
foot
to
the
fire
i
admire
this
but
i
be
not
sure
it
s
need
i
absolutely
believe
however
that
director
should
demand
and
review
fully
transparent
compensation
analysis
and
hold
the
ceo
accountable
for
get
to
pay
parity
it
s
about
time
each
of
these
point
be
a
matter
of
a
company
s
integrity
but
the
market
be
pay
attention
too
gender
diversity
and
work
life
matter
belong
in
the
environmental
social
and
corporate
governance
goal
that
be
increasingly
use
as
screen
standard
for
investor
the
best
run
most
successful
company
in
the
come
decade
will
be
those
that
demonstrate
the
most
foresight
on
people
matter
and
i
think
their
stock
performance
will
reflect
this
this
doesn
t
mean
ever
more
generous
hr
program
it
mean
company
as
part
of
their
purpose
must
pursue
the
smartest
combination
of
policy
to
let
employee
flourish
at
work
and
at
home
related
to
all
of
this
who
be
on
the
board
if
the
boss
of
the
ceo
don
t
understand
these
issue
at
a
deep
level
and
nudge
the
company
toward
them
change
won
t
happen
unfortunately
woman
hold
just
percent
of
us
corporate
board
seat
in
my
view
company
should
consider
set
term
limit
on
board
member
of
fifteen
year
and
a
mandatory
retirement
age
of
seventy
two
immediately
they
could
also
expand
their
board
by
one
or
two
member
to
make
room
for
qualify
people
who
well
understand
the
issue
face
work
woman
and
young
family


shortly
after
i
take
over
pepsico
i
invite
female
ceo
of
large
company
to
my
home
for
a
dinner
party
some
be
friend
with
one
another
and
some
do
business
together
but
as
a
group
we
hadn
t
gather
this
way
before
i
be
hop
we
could
collectively
make
our
voice
heard
for
woman
in
corporate
america
i
also
thought
we
might
forge
some
sort
of
kitchen
cabinet
an
informal
network
that
we
could
rely
on
for
advice
or
support
as
we
ran
our
company
i
be
spur
to
do
this
in
part
by
a
memorable
visit
to
pepsico
a
few
week
earlier
by
hillary
clinton
who
be
one
of
new
york
s
us
senator
at
the
time
i
d
never
met
her
before
she
be
very
friendly
and
we
first
sat
down
in

statistic
about

city
we
share
story
of
the
little
thing
that
add
up
in
our
career
to
define
us
separate
from
the
men
we
found
that
our
path
be
distinct
but
familiar
to
one
another
we
talk
about
the
market
our
industry
and
the
burden
of
be
the
bos
we
discuss
the
slow
progress
for
woman
in
leadership
and
the
tough
slog
of
convincing
men
in
power
that
elevate
woman
be
worth
their
true
attention
as
everyone
put
on
their
coat
to
leave
we
vowed
to
meet
regularly
and
to
add
to
our
group
nine
month
later
i
host
again
cherie
blair
attend
with
her
husband
tony
blair
who
have
just
step
down
as
uk
prime
minister
she
be
work
on
woman
s
initiative
and
be
eager
to
join
force
we
talk
more
about
what
we
might
do
to
help
woman
in
the
pipeline
yet
again
we
vowed
to
meet
soon
someone
else
insist
they
would
host
then
nothing
happen
this
be
no
one
s
fault
the
simple
truth
be
that
none
of
us
have
an
extra
ounce
of
time
to
create
a
strong
support
organization
for
female
ceo
and
our
prot
g
s
if
anyone
be
wonder
there
be
no
club
of
the
most
senior
woman
in
corporate
america


men
in
business
operate
in
a
system
with
century
of
history
related
to
play
that
role
in
society
their
club
and
association
be
establish
long
ago
and
they
don
t
have
to
do
anything
extra
to
set
them
up
the
men
who
go
to
war
together
have
a
camaraderie
and
emotional
connection
that
extend
well
into
their
work
life
despite
our
advance
woman
be
still
break
into
this
world
we
belong
to
every
industry
group
and
fill
the
seat
on
nonprofit
board
but
men
have
the
distinct
advantage
of
have
create
the
rule
of
the
game
and
we
aren
t
invite
everywhere
even
in
the
most
obvious
circumstance
integrate
woman
into
the
custom
of
power
and
influence
have
prove
strangely
controversial
in
the
augusta
national
golf
club
in
augusta
georgia
which
host
the
annual
master

be
a
woman
ibm
be
one
of
the
master
big
sponsor
to
be
sure
this
be
a
tip
point
a
year
later
the
club
change
its
eighty
year
old
male
only
policy
and
admit
its
first
two

and
business
story
may
seem
clich
but
connection
forge
over

aren
t
incidental

more
executive
have
use
the
club
for
year
to
entertain
customer

the
catch
for
me

that
this

thought
get
around
that
be
easy
raj

tick

approach

i
find
that
these

often
poorly

bad

bore
fidgety
and

i
m
disappointed
that
even

conference
where
this
scenario
play
out
we
need
to
be

expand

then
we
will
have

positive
that
these

have
filter
into
the

power
structure
and
broken
through

also

very
quickly
it
s
usually

myself
at

forty
year
ago
i
see
the
future
leader
of
pepsico
and
other
big
multinational
company
i
see
scientist
and
entrepreneur
with

i
see
in
those
woman
and
men
my
own
daughter
who
now
both
have
graduate
business
degree
and
grasp
the
world
as
a
social

economic
puzzle
the
way
i
do
we
end
the
two
day
seminar
with
a
relaxed
open
conversation
in
which
the
student
can
talk
to
me
about
anything
and
after
lot
of
insightful
global
business
question
these
young
people
so
full
of
promise
invariably
ask
me
this
how
do
you
do
it
how
do
you
rise
in
your
career
and
keep
your
family
together
and
then
anxiously
they
add
how
can
we
do
it
i
reply
honestly
it
wasn
t
easy
my
life
be
a
constant
juggling
act
with
pain
guilt
and
trade
offs
run
a
global
company
be
a
tremendous
privilege
but
i
have
some
regret
too
life
be
like
that
i
have
be
ask
some
version
of
these
question
hundred
of
time
at
yale
west
point
and
other
school
at
pepsico
factory
at
roundtable
in
latin
america
or
the
middle
east
at
major
woman
s
event
after
fireside
chat
with
academic
and
with
young
leader
of
the
world
economic
forum
i
get
dozen
of
email
and
letter
from
friend
acquaintance
and
stranger
who
want
my
advice
about
how
to
combine
work
and
family
sometimes
i
feel
like
these
people
think
i
have
some
sort
of
secret
recipe
because
i
manage
to
pull
it
off
i
don
t
in
many
way
i
be
just
lucky
with
my
close
knit
household
great
education
and
parent
who
value
their
daughter
as
much
as
their
son
i
married
a
man
who
share
my
ideal
we
support
each
other
and
we
start
out
carefully
and
frugally
we
ve
have
our
disagreement
that
s
true
in
every
marriage
but
raj
and
i
have
steadfast
love
and
commitment
to
each
other
and
our
child
i
also
have
constant
help
from
relative
and
later
could
afford
to
hire
people
to
help
me
both
at
work
and
at
home
i
met
mentor
at
critical
moment
and
as
many
have
remind
me
i
have
the
special
genetics
of
not
have
to
sleep
more
than
five
hour
a
night
i
have
the
good
fortune
too
of
land
at
pepsico
a
company
with
a
youthful
ethos
that
be
male
dominate
when
i
join
in
the
s
but
not
so
stuck
in
its
way
that
i
didn
t
fit
in
pepsico
name
me
the
ceo
and
that
make
all
the
difference
i
don
t
think
many
other
us
corporate
board
at
the
time
would
have
select
someone
who
look
like
me
to
lead
i
don
t
mind
repeat
that
do
well
at
work
be
by
definition
a
full
time
job
be
a
mother
a
wife
a
daughter
and
a
daughter
in
law
can
also
be
full
time
job
and
i
found
be
a
ceo
be
at
least
three
full
time
job
so
while
i
devote
every
drop
of
my
talent
and
time
to
it
all
my
success
be
actually
a
bit
like
win
the
lottery
somehow
it
work
out


this
be
no
model
for
achieve
real
progress
on
combine
career
and
family
in
a
world
where
society
s
explicit
message
to
young
family
builder
in
recent
decade
have
largely
be
this
if
you
want
job
and
kid
it
s
your
problem
my
story
doesn
t
change
the
heartbreaking
reality
that
we
as
a
society
haven
t
built
robust
contemporary
system
to
truly
support
anyone
male
or
female
who
want
to
both
earn
a
good
living
and
build
a
happy
healthy
home
life
in
fact
the
situation
in
the
us
be
even
tougher
now
than
when
raj
and
i
start
out
health
care
childcare
education
and
housing
use
up
a
far
large
percentage
of
average
income
than
in
the
early
s
the
stress
surround
work
and
family
have
many
millennials
sadly
delay
marriage
and
childbirth
or
decide
not
to
have
kid
at
all
in
the
us
fertility
rate
fell
to
birth
per
woman
of
childbearing
age
a
record
low
meanwhile
some
woman
be
do
all
they
can
to
hang
on
to
their
chance
to
have
a
baby
include
pay
the
enormous
financial
physical
and
emotional
cost
of
freeze
their
egg
a
few
corporate
benefit
plan
now
cover
this
procedure
an
accommodation
to
those
who
may
have
spent
so
much
time
on
their
education
and
job
that
they
haven
t
yet
have
the
chance
to
take
on
pregnancy
and
motherhood
too
it
s
more
evidence
that
our
system
put
the
career
clock
and
the
female
biological
clock
in
direct
conflict
i
be
so
excite
to
see
how
the
millennial
generation
and
the
gen
zers
who
follow
them
will
drive
our
economy
and
improve
the
world
i
have
be
witness
as
a
ceo
deeply
interested
in
people
to
countless
example
of
their
sincerity
imagination
and
purpose
in
a
shift
business
world
but
i
believe
that
we
also
need
these
woman
and
men
to
be
parent
and
to
let
them
actually
enjoy
that
incomparable
experience
not
everyone
have
to
want
child
let
alone
the
baby
that
be
the
standard
population
replacement
rate
but
broadly
i
think
we
need
to
do
more
to
value
family
have
child
and
raise
them
to
be
educate
productive
citizen
those
child
be
also
necessary
the
demographic
picture
be
clear
in
the
us
ten
thousand
baby
boomer
turn
sixty
five
every
day
a
pattern
that
s
expect
to
continue
into
the
s
these
folk
and
the
one
who
come
after
them
will
live
longer
than
any
previous
group
the
number
of
old
american
be
expect
to
double
by
we
will
need
the
stability
of
a
strong
economy
and
over
time
million
of
new
worker
pay
into
the
system
to
support
the
age
population
the
us
be
not
alone
in
this
a
similar
scenario
be
play
out
in
developed
country
everywhere
and
increasingly
in
develop
country
too


i
m
not
the
first
to
say
it
but
it
s
also
tragic
to
me
that
no
matter
how
hard
our
young
woman
and
men
work
in
a
school
like
insead
or
in
a
family
business
in
india
or
in
a
factory
in
indiana
they
re
still
deal
with
so
many
rule
and
expectation
from
the
past
that
don
t
reflect
real
life
again
this
be
the
most
skilled
creative
and
connect
group
in
history
with
so
much
potential
we
can
t
go
on
have
them
repeatedly
stymie
by
how
can
we
do
it
i
be
atop
a
fortune
company
for
a
long
time
and
it
s
second
nature
to
me
to
calculate
return
on
investment
with
pwp
pepsico
acknowledge
that
the
line
between
business
and
society
be
blurring
and
our
challenge
be
not
to
deny
the
ambiguity
but
to
accept
them
we
set
the
company
on
a
course
that
delivers
great
result
for
shareholder
and
pepsico
be
evolve
with
some
trial
and
error
to
become
a
model
of
sustainable
capitalism
now
i
have
the
same
instinct
about
elevate
work
and
family
to
much
more
prominent
consideration
in
business
and
the
economy
once
and
for
all
we
must
embrace
the
fact
that
both
woman
and
men
work
in
job
outside
their
home
that
child
need
fantastic
care
that
our
age
parent
need
tender
attention
and
that
government
company
community
and
individual
need
a
common
road
map
to
address
the
massive
complex
social
issue
involve
in
make
life
a
little
easy
what
well
purpose
could
we
have
for
this
than
to
take
care
of
our
love
one
advance
gender
equality
and
i
be
convince
generate
tremendous
economic
benefit
the
return
in
the
long
haul
will
be
extraordinary


often
when
people
approach
me
to
talk
about
their
struggle
with
work
and
family
or
to
ask
my
advice
they
begin
with
a
story
some
woman
say
they
be
torn
between
their
career
and
the
tug
of
a
baby
at
home
single
parent
say
they
be
cop
with
a
sick
child
and
afraid
they
will
lose
their
only
source
of
income
some
people
mention
age
parent
with
dementia
or
adult
child
whose
kid
have
land
on
their
doorstep
others
talk
about
cultural
expectation
to
do
more
at
home
in
a
way
that
can
t
align
with
their
paid
work
obligation
the
issue
i
find
be
frequently
a
question
of
care
care
be
a
warm
and
fuzzy
word
but
they
talk
about
it
with
so
much
pain
that
have
always
move
me
to
somehow
want
to
smooth
their
path
now
our
collective
experience
with
covid
billion
of
people
struggle
to
balance
their
livelihood
with
obligation
at
home
when
kid
weren
t
in
school
when
family
and
friend
be
sick
or
when
they
be
isolated
like
never
before
have
add
a
new
urgency
to
this
work
for
me
as
the
global
order
responds
to
what
we
learn
during
the
pandemic
we
have
arrive
at
a
unique
moment
for
change


to
begin
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
support
family
and
the
role
that
woman
in
particular
play
both
in
paid
work
and
at
home
as
mother
and
caregiver
be
essential
for
all
of
us
that
s
evident
in
every
culture
in
the
world
and
i
don
t
think
we
need
to
spend
much
time
and
energy
reframing
this
message
yet
again
the
problem
in
my
view
be
who
be
receive
the
message
and
who
have
the
power
and
influence
to
respond
to
it
in
a
meaningful
way
this
be
where
we
should
all
be
frustrate
with
so
few
woman
in
leadership
position
include
in
company
and
government
we
have
to
rely
on
men
i
know
that
men
with
real
power
in
our
society
admire
their
mother
wife
and
daughter
and
that
they
have
see
load
of
evidence
that
help
woman
succeed
in
their
organization
can
help
the
bottom
line
they
also
understand
that
the
march
to
woman
s
equality
spell
progress
in
the
twenty
first
century
still
many
men
ceo
and
others
perpetually
linger
on
the
sideline
of
the
work
family
debate
in
part
because
they
be
reluctant
to
break
routine
that
be
ultimately
easy
comfortable
and
lucrative
for
them
i
ve
notice
that
young
men
include
husband
and
dad
who
be
just
as
stress
as
their
partner
also
refrain
from
this
discussion
perhaps
fearful
of
hurt
their
own
chance
to
move
ahead
i
believe
that
men
need
to
recognize
how
many
woman
be
held
back
or
depart
the
workforce
in
the
middle
of
their
career
and
how
many
woman
often
in
the
shadow
of
the
economy
be
work
to
hold
up
our
entire
system
they
need
to
realize
that
this
be
their
burden
too
real
change
in
the
matter
of
integrate
work
and
family
isn
t
go
to
happen
without
men
especially
those
in
power
help
drive
the
discussion
and
help
implement
the
solution
i
think
that
a
woman
aim
to
be
ceo
of
a
public
company
or
anything
close
to
it
in
term
of
power
pay
and
responsibility
also
need
to
be
realistic
about
how
thing
will
play
out
i
celebrate
woman
s
ambition
to
lead
and
have
no
doubt
of
the
bias
they
encounter
still
compete
to
reach
the
very
top
of
an
organizational
pyramid
be
a
brutal
business
no
matter
who
you
be
and
once
a
woman
or
a
man
be
within
strike
distance
of
the
ceo
s
office
two
or
three
level
away
the
idea
of
balance
work
with
any
kind
of
normal
life
outside
work
isn
t
practical
in
my
experience
the
requirement
for
do
those
job
be
boundless
and
can
occupy
almost
every
moment
this
isn
t
to
say
that
female
ceo
shouldn
t
have
child
and
happy
family
of
course
they
should
i
do
but
make
no
mistake
the
require
support
system
and
sacrifice
to
lead
at
the
very
top
be
enormous
broad
base
solution
that
help
most
people
find
well
work
family
balance
may
not
apply


in
as
be
my
style
when
tackle
a
big
idea
i
begin
reading
a
load
of
book
and
research
on
integrate
work
and
family
on
woman
s
role
in
the
economy
and
on
why
some
woman
advance
to
leadership
position
when
so
many
don
t
i
start
speak
to
scholar
advocate
and
entrepreneur
and
look
at
government
and
corporate
intervention
from
around
the
world
on
these
issue
one
day
i
even
organize
my
think
by
create
equation
with
career
woman
systemic
bias
family
social
pressure
on
one
side
and
a
long
list
of
possible
offset
on
the
other
side
through
it
all
i
thought
often
of
my
own
story
i
be
happy
i
finally
have
some
time
post
pepsico
to
well
understand
the
interplay
of
bias
gender
family
employer
and
the
global
power
structure
i
also
thought
about
the
great
diversity
of
the
us
how
this
country
welcome
me
and
despite
some
early
bump
in
the
road
let
me
flourish
and
make
a
name
for
myself
i
wouldn
t
have
risen
to
these
height
in
any
other
country
in
the
world
despite
our
continue
struggle
with
how
to
evolve
as
a
nation
found
on
the
idea
of
equal
opportunity
to
everyone
i
be
proud
of
how
far
we
ve
come
and
where
we
can
go
next
this
be
a
very
personal
road
my
conclusion
be
that
our
society
can
leap
ahead
on
the
work
family
conundrum
by
focus
on
three
interconnect
area
paid
leave
flexibility
and
predictability
and
care
we
must
recognize
that
these
three
element
of
how
we
look
after
one
another
function
together
and
must
evolve
together
i
believe
that
collective
action
on
each
of
them
will
lay
the
foundation
to
transform
our
economy
and
community
because
finally
the
next
generation
of
family
will
have
the
reasonable
systemic
foundation
they
need
to
prosper


first
paid
maternity
and
paternity
leave
must
be
mandate
by
the
us
government
as
soon
as
possible
maternal
and
child
health
be
compromise
every
day
when
woman
return
to
work
too
soon
after
have
a
baby
because
they
can
t
afford
to
be
off
without
pay
the
us
be
the
only
developed
country
in
the
world
where
paid
leave
for
a
new
baby
be
only
now
make
its
way
into
law
because
some
state
government
have
take
it
up
this
isn
t
enough
we
need
this
to
be
true
across
the
nation
include
for
all
federal
government
employee
some
may
rail
against
the
cost
to
government
and
business
of
this
basic
social
provision
that
s
entirely
outdated
think
because
we
know
the
long
list
of
physical
and
mental
benefit
to
both
infant
and
parent
when
they
bond
and
heal
in
the
week
after
birth
paid
maternity
and
paternity
leave
be
a
necessary
link
in
the
chain
of
create
healthy
life
and
in
the
long
run
a
successful
robust
country
in
fact
this
be
not
spending
it
s
investment
woman
who
take
paid
leave
be
percent
more
likely
to
be
in
the
workforce
twelve
month
after
a
child
s
birth
than
woman
who
take
no
leave
and
father
who
take
leave
be
more
likely
to
share
childcare
and
household
responsibility
equitably
with
their
female
partner
over
the
long
term
and
to
have
great
empathy
for
family
demand
this
be
a
no
brainer
i
would
start
with
twelve
week
of
paid
time
off
for
the
mother
or
the
primary
caregiver
of
a
new
baby
and
eight
week
for
the
father
or
secondary
caregiver
some
will
argue
for
more
or
less
time
although
this
baseline
be
a
good
start
and
i
believe
could
be
accommodate
by
a
wide
swath
of
employer
it
s
very
true
that
small
business
will
have
a
tough
time
when
integral
employee
be
away
for
a
few
month
but
i
also
think
this
be
an
area
where
we
can
think
more
creatively
about
solve
the
problem
what
about
a
corp
of
retiree
who
can
step
in
to
help
fund
by
a
community
s
pool
resource
what
private
public
or
philanthropic
resource
should
we
use
where
do
technology
fit
in
this
pressure
point
be
fixable
if
we
put
our
mind
to
it
the
us
paid
leave
debate
include
extend
the
benefit
to
those
care
for
sick
family
member
or
employee
recover
from
illness
these
be
very
important
provision
i
would
not
have
become
the
ceo
of
pepsico
without
take
advantage
of
all
three
type
of
paid
leave
during
my
early
career
bcg
paid
me
both
when
my
father
be
sick
and
when
i
be
recover
from
my
car
accident
and
i
receive
paid
maternity
leave
twice
through
both
bcg
and
abb
however
while
we
debate
the
cost
and
parameter
of
how
to
expand
this
benefit
within
a
broader
care
economy
i
see
no
reason
why
paid
leave
related
to
all
newborn
baby
in
the
country
should
not
be
implement
immediately


of
course
parent
return
to
work
after
their
maternity
or
paternity
leave
still
have
a
very
young
child
and
we
know
that
the
long
stand
constraint
of
absolutely
set
time
and
place
for
work
be
no
longer
require
in
many
job
i
support
work
flexibility
as
the
norm
in
addition
to
its
advantage
across
the
whole
economy
flexibility
be
an
integral
part
of
give
family
some
breathing
room
it
obviously
help
both
woman
and
men
look
after
kid
and
age
parent
and
deal
with
the
other
strain
of
modern
life
plus
we
learn
fast
during
the
covid
crisis
that
our
economy
be
fully
equip
across
many
role
and
industry
for
people
to
work
remotely
to
be
sure
i
also
think
office
be
here
to
stay
we
crave
the
creativity
that
bubble
up
when
people
be
work
together
in
the
same
space
and
can
talk
face
to
face
and
share
human
connection
but
in
general
i
believe
our
workday
should
be
organize
around
productivity
not
time
and
place
at
a
minimum
we
should
give
worker
whose
job
mostly
happen
at
a
desk
the
choice
to
work
from
wherever
they
want
at
home
in
a
coworking
space
or
in
a
central
office
evaluation
should
be
adjust
so
that
people
who
spend
less
time
physically
in
the
office
aren
t
judged
differently
from
those
who
spend
more
time
there
we
don
t
want
to
create
different
class
of
worker
again
cast
people
with
family
obligation
in
a
negative
light
shift
worker
who
must
physically
be
in
a
space
to
do
their
job
from
a
factory
floor
to
a
retail
shop
have
a
different
set
of
struggle
work
flexibility
be
very
limited
in
these
job
but
we
need
to
make
sure
these
employee
have
schedule
predictability
at
least
two
week
out
this
be
paramount
and
a
matter
of
respect
the
lack
of
predictable
hour
for
many
worker
especially
those
with
care
responsibility
be
extremely
difficult
to
manage
meanwhile
shift
worker
who
have
predictable
schedule
have
prove
to
be
both
more
productive
and
commit
to
their
employer
today
every
company
have
access
to
sophisticated
schedule
technology
why
not
use
it
to
make
life
easy
for
the
worker
who
need
it
most
early
in
my
career
my
lack
of
work
flexibility
and
the
feel
that
i
could
never
simply
schedule
my
time
in
a
way
that
make
sense
for
me
be
among
the
most
stressful
aspect
of
my
life
the
only
way
i
get
through
this
when
preetha
and
tara
be
small
be
that
i
have
gerhard
as
a
bos
at
both
motorola
and
abb
he
knew
my
family
and
be
very
understand
at
pepsico
i
be
senior
enough
to
allocate
my
hour
however
i
want
to
but
give
all
that
be
go
on
at
the
company
i
allocate
almost
all
of
them
to
pepsico
not
long
ago
i
be
drive
near
my
home
one
afternoon
and
saw
a
couple
of
school
bus
drop
child
off
on
a
street
corner
with
their
parent
wait
to
greet
them
mom
and
dad
work
from
home
be
able
to
take
a
quick
break
to
pick
up
their
kid
from
the
bus
i
look
longingly
at
this
scene
again
remind
that
i
miss
that
experience
because
of
the
era
in
which
i
have
my
career
as
work
flexibility
becomes
more
typical
supercharge
by
our
experience
during
the
pandemic
i
m
glad
that
more
parent
may
be
able
to
take
a
little
time
to
welcome
their
kid
after
school
i
also
believe
in
take
the
idea
of
flexibility
one
step
far
worker
should
be
able
to
pause
their
career
for
the
sake
of
their
home
life
for
longer
period
without
suffer
the
social
and
economic
penalty
that
be
still
common
this
doesn
t
oblige
employer
to
keep
a
job
open
for
year
or
pay
people
for
the
extra
month
they
be
away
but
we
should
encourage
many
more
option
to
let
people
come
in
and
out
of
paid
work
some
company
have
introduce
program
that
acquaint
return
employee
with
new
job
requirement
and
new
organizational
priority
for
those
who
build
this
into
their
business
model
there
be
clear
advantage
returnees
with
institutional
knowledge
and
network
can
be
very
valuable
hire
why
not
take
advantage
of
their
expertise
this
could
very
well
be
the
future
of
work


finally
we
must
address
care
this
be
the
most
important
i
believe
that
the
big
investment
we
can
make
in
the
future
of
our
population
be
to
build
a
reliable
high
quality
safe
and
affordable
care
infrastructure
focus
on
childcare
from
birth
to
age
five
and
to
expand
our
think
to
include
the
whole
cycle
of
life
the
covid
crisis
expose
the
beleaguer
state
of
the
us
care
economy
one
consequence
of
this
mess
be
that
hundred
of
thousand
of
woman
who
have
be
manage
job
and
kid
felt
they
have
to
quit
their
paid
work
we
be
also
remind
that
so
many
of
our
essential
worker
include
caregiver
to
both
child
and
the
old
don
t
earn
enough
money
to
live
on
it
s
about
time
that
care
attracts
moonshot
think
in
the
us
fix
this
issue
will
remove
barrier
to
work
for
woman
and
young
family
and
help
many
woman
achieve
financial
independence
this
be
a
commitment
to
future
generation
that
will
lay
the
foundation
for
a
healthier
more
prosperous
population
i
believe
though
that
focus
on
care
will
do
even
more
as
a
businessperson
who
successfully
ran
a
large
american
company
for
a
dozen
year
i
can
attest
that
this
will
be
a
competitive
advantage
for
every
company
community
and
state
where
we
make
it
happen
let
s
start
with
child
regardless
of
paid
leave
duration
or
a
parent
s
time
flexibility
baby
and
young
child
need
care
when
their
mom
and
dad
be
work
right
now
for
many
parent
find
good
day
care
in
a
center
that
be
either
close
to
home
or
close
to
their
job
be
near
impossible
because
there
simply
aren
t
enough
spot
or
they
be
just
too
expensive
and
that
problem
doesn
t
take
into
account
care
for
child
whose
parent
work
at
night
or
need
backup
help
a
different
plan
might
be
hire
an
individual
nanny
to
look
after
the
child
an
approach
that
be
usually
more
expensive
and
present
more
question
again
whom
to
hire
how
much
to
pay
how
to
supervise
what
be
the
boundary
many
parent
still
end
up
with
the
kind
of
makeshift
care
arrangement
that
raj
and
i
rely
on
in
chicago
when
preetha
be
a
baby
thirty
five
year
ago
we
met
someone
in
a
social
environment
and
left
our
precious
child
with
her
vasantha
be
wonderful
and
have
brought
up
four
kid
of
her
own
but
she
be
an
acquaintance
not
a
train
childcare
worker
the
fact
that
she
work
out
well
as
preetha
s
babysitter
for
us
that
winter
be
really
just
luck
if
we
hadn
t
like
her
we
would
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
and
energy
look
for
someone
else
drain
our
momentum
at
work
that
s
the
scene
that
played
out
for
us
in
connecticut
a
few
year
later
even
when
we
spent
the
extra
money
on
a
nanny
agency
nothing
much
have
change
we
need
the
federal
and
state
government
the
private
sector
and
expert
in
early
childhood
education
and
community
building
to
come
together
to
create
a
full
scale
creatively
design
childcare
system
that
eliminates
so
call
childcare
desert
i
laud
the
people
who
have
be
work
on
this
issue
for
decade
as
well
as
program
such
as
head
start
and
other
pre
k
initiative
that
do
tremendous
work
to
prepare
child
for
their
school
year
ahead
but
i
be
suggest
we
go
much
far
we
need
to
expand
program
that
exist
today
network
them
with
in
home
care
option
and
link
them
with
community
organization
that
have
building
from
religious
institution
to
library
to
create
a
new
generation
of
terrific
option
we
also
need
comprehensive
licensing
and
training
program
for
childcare
owner
and
staff
and
we
need
to
pay
caregiver
wage
that
reflect
their
awesome
responsibility
early
childhood
education
so
critical
for
every
baby
s
lifelong
well
be
be
a
grow
field
why
not
create
incentive
to
get
young
people
into
these
job
it
be
hearten
to
see
the
biden
administration
take
on
care
as
critical
infrastructure
for
the
country
and
i
cheer
on
janet
yellen
the
treasury
secretary
when
she
recently
declare
that
our
policymaking
have
not
account
for
the
fact
that
people
s
work
life
and
their
personal
life
be
inextricably
link
and
if
one
suffers
so
do
the
other
but
the
follow
through
for
any
white
house
initiative
will
be
paramount
give
block
grant
to
state
to
address
care
be
a
good
start
for
instance
but
it
s
important
that
the
template
for
great
care
network
be
specify
upfront
and
that
detail
of
the
spending
be
monitor
this
issue
deserves
a
historic
commitment
that
should
extend
for
decade
to
come


while
the
government
set
out
how
best
to
implement
this
moonshot
large
company
and
other
employer
should
step
up
where
possible
company
should
add
on
site
or
near
site
childcare
for
their
employee
if
the
number
of
child
doesn
t
sustain
that
investment
company
should
work
with
others
to
pool
childcare
service
either
near
office
or
in
residential
cluster
at
pepsico
headquarters
the
total
cost
of
retrofit
one
floor
of
our
headquarters
into
a
childcare
facility
an
amount
that
i
insist
we
spend
even
with
skeptic
all
around
me
be
about
million
we
hire

a

the

offer
incredible
return
in

of
loyalty

peace

for
our
current

it
save
them

and
they
be
close
by
if
their

have
an
emergency
it
be
also
a
terrific
recruiting
tool
the
service
wasn
t
free
to
employee
they
paid
for
their

to
be
there
but
within
a
year
pepstart
be
oversubscribed
small
company
or
those
with
a
more
flexible
workforce
should
consider
create
consortium
to
run
joint
childcare
center
or
work
in
partnership
with

from

childcare
attach
to
coworking
location
should
be
a
give
i
call
this
a
moonshot
but
we
be
not
bet
on
the
unknown
here
those
country
with
comprehensive
childcare
network
do
keep

in
that
province
we
must
also
include
elder
care
in
our
discussion
and
recommendation
the
care
responsibility
of
family
do
not
end
when
the
young
child
leaf
home
that
be
not
just
because
the
emotional
work
of
a
parent
be
never
do
it
s
because
more
people
than
ever
will
require
help
well
into
their
eighty
and
the
majority
will
rely
on
unpaid
care
from
family
and
friend
many
of
these
unpaid
caregiver
who
be
mostly
woman
be
in
the
sandwich
generation
and
have
both
child
and
old
relative
to
support
redesign
the
structure
and
location
of
senior
care
center
may
be
part
of
this
effort
too
as
we
contemplate
a
world
with
a
grow
senior
population
one
complement
to
senior
care
center
be
multigenerational
living
i
grow
up
with
three
generation
of
family
and
have
no
doubt
that
this
brought
great
benefit
to
my
sister
my
brother
and
me
not
least
the
presence
in
our
home
of
our
wise
thatha
age
population
all
over
the
world
be
revive
the
idea
of
the
multigenerational
family
as
more
people
become
great
grandparent
and
even
great
great
grandparent
every
day
this
be
often
write
about
as
a
grow
problem
a
demographic
time
bomb
where
pension
be
become
unaffordable
and
health
service
overburden
we
need
to
turn
this
on
its
head
a
large
age
population
could
be
a
blessing
the
old
generation
be
a
great
support
system
for
family
million
of
grandparent
in
the
us
provide
childcare

again
we
haven
t
adjust
to
make
it
easy
for
these
vital
family
structure
to
work
for
instance

stuck
in
the
last
century
prevent
house
with
separate
kitchen
or
entrance
and
prohibit
multifamily
dwelling
this
present
another
path
for
change
we
need
to
get
local
ass
these
law
and
gather
the
steam
to
change
them
while
we

embrace
our
