put

on
a
corporate

it

excite
to

regardless

though
this
be
less
a
story
about
a
company
rise
steadily
through
the
fortune
than
it
be
one
of
humble
beginning
because
that
s
the
real
miracle
of
dollar
tree
not
how
big
and
successful
it
be
today
but
how
unlikely
its
good
fortuneseemedjustafewyearsago
it
s
the
story
of
an
unassuming
man
from
the
north
carolina
stick
who
come
to
a
city
norfolk
virginia
to
learn
how
to
cut
hair
and
stuck
around
to
open
a
barbershop
it
s
the
story
of
how
he
parlayed
that
shop
into
a
busy
little
knot
of
enterprise
after
world
war
ii
among
them
an
old
ben
franklin
variety
store
it
s
the
story
of
how
he
enlist
his
family
into
the
business
and
then
a
cadre
of
loyal
staff
many
of
whom
be
in
high
school
when
they
sign
on
and
most
of
whom
didn
t
have
a
lick
of
college
credit
and
how
together
they
work
long
day
against
long
odds
to
build
something
outofnext
tonothing
it
s
a
story
i
know
well
because
i
be
part
of
it
that
barber
be
my
father
in
law
today
i
m
the
chairman
of
dollar
tree
s
board
of
director
for
many
year
i
serve
as
the
company
s
president
and
chief
executive
officer
i
be
its
public
face
as
we
demonstrate
year
after
year
that
the
idea
at
the
heart
of
the
business
that
we
could
price
quality
merchandise
that
consistently
surprised
and
delighted
customer
at
just
one
dollar
and
hold
to
that
price
nomatterwhat
wasn
ta
crazyas
itfirstseemed
which
be
one
of
the
reason
it
s
important
to
me
to
tell
this
story
now
because
iwasdollar
tree
s
spokesman
in
thepress
and
its
faceto
thepublic
i
get
much
of
the
credit
for
the
company
s
success
dollar
tree
and
macon
brock
become
synonymous
in
a
lot
of
people
s
mind
and
that
s
not
how
it
be
i
m
no
genius
i
didn
t
come
up
with
the
dollar
store
idea
and
can
t
claim
any
flash
of
brilliance
that
transform
one
tiny
store
into
a
national
chain
i
work
hard
hell
i
work
my
as
off
but
so
do
the
people
around
me
trite
though
it
sound
i
be
part
of
a
team
it
be
a
small
team
early
on
and
a
big
one
later
but
always
a
real
team
every
member
be
essential
to
what
we
create
and
everyone
live
and
work
by
principle
that
we
come
tovaluetogether
do
your
best
do
the
right
thing
when
in
doubt
choose
the
solution
that
work
best
for
the
long
term
be
the
bos
or
one
of
the
boss
be
only
so
important
what
make
the
difference
and
make
the
company
be
collective
effort
we
all
from
buyer
to
warehouse
worker
store
manager
to
computer
whizz
accountant
to
payroll
clerk
be
the
creator
of
dollar
tree
we
share
a
sense
of
mission
we
embark
on
an
adventure
that
we
weren
t
sure
would
end
the
way
we
want
it
to
but
we
be
united
in
give
it
our
best
shot
in
theprocess
webecamecloser
thanmostfamilies
so
before
my
memory
start
to
slip
i
want
to
assign
the
credit
for
our
success
to
the
people
who
make
it
happen
i
ll
narrate
the
proceeding
and
in
the
course
of
do
so
i
ll
share
my
own
meander
journey
to
and
from
that
ben
franklin
store
that
start
it
all
but
make
no
mistake
this
be
our
story
notjust
mine
i
have
a
second
related
motive
today
with
the
company
grown
beyond
our
wild
imaginings
most
of
us
be
retire
or
have
move
on
to
new
venture
onlya
few
membersof
theteam
still
gotowork
every
day
in
dollar
tree
s
office
and
while
i
have
nothing
but
admiration
for
the
many
way
that
our
successor
have
built
on
what
we
start
not
to
mention
the
spectacular
result
they
ve
achieve
i
worry
that
the
excitement
and
drama
and
sheer
improbability
of
the
early
day
will
be
forgotten
once
the
last
of
us
leaf
i
don
t
want
that
to
happen
a
company
be
more
than
an
engine
for
deliver
bag
of
cash
to
its
stockholder
in
america
especially
it
s
among
the
most
important
building
block
of
society
we
each
might

becausewehavetopay

shareasense
ofpurposewithourcoworkers
building
and
sustain
that
sense
of
purpose
that
culture
require
an
awareness
of
history
you
can
understand
yourself
only
so
much
if
you
know
nothing
of
your
parent
the
circumstance
of
your
birth
your
early
childhood
tradition
mean
little
if
you
don
t
understand
where
they
come
from
and
why
it
s
important
that
you
stick
to
them
or
challenge
them
and
startnewones
so
in
share
the
tale
of
dollar
tree
s
creation
and
its
long
prehistory
i
hope
to
offer
up
a
corporate
genealogy
if
you
will
i
figure
that
explain
where
this
mercantile
juggernaut
come
from
and
how
and
why
it
turn
out
to
be
a
winner
will
be
instructive
to
those
ninety
thousand
people
now
work
at
the
company
who
will
leap
in
number
in
the
next
few
year
as
for
folk
who
have
no
connection
to
dollar
tree
and
no
intention
of
get
into
the
dollar
store
business
themselves
well
i
hope
they
ll
find
something
useful
inthelessonswelearnedalongtheway
most
of
all
though
i
don
t
want
the
early
day
forgotten
because
they
make
for
a
good
story

he
do

it
like
any

always
follow
his
advice

his
dedication
to
fitness
be
something
i
embrace
from
early
on
he
be
a
kind
man
with
a
nurture
bedside
manner
and
be
adore
by
his

it
be
commonplace
that
after
put
in

long

tend
to
the

do
me
no
favor
and
as
my
senior
year
begin
back
at
granby
my
parent
worry
about
my
college
prospect
dim
next
to
other
more
basic
concern
what
if
i
amount
to
absolutely
nothing
what
if
i
couldn
t

letalonea
family
they
never
share
this
in
so
many
word
but
they
didn
t
have
to
they
knew
someone
who
be
a
harbor
pilot
and
they
approach
him
about
perhaps
take
me
on
they
sat
me
down
to
talk
about
it
pilot
make
good
money
they
say
this
would
be
a
career
not
just
a
job
what
i
take
away
from
the
conversation
wasn
t
that
pilot
be
a
viable
option
which
it
wasn
t
actually
because
the
rare
job
opening
almost
always
go
to
family
but
that
my
parent
be
in
a
panic
they
be
cast
about
for
something
anything
tohead
offmyimpendingfailure
and
with
that
something
funny
happen
their
doubt
heck
their
certainty
that
i
be
destine
to
fall
flat
ignite
a
contrary
resolve
in
me
i
can
t
point
to
any
particular
moment
when
i
become
aware
of
this
course
correction
but
i
can
say
that
once
it
take
hold
a
determination
grow
inside
me
until
it
become
a
consume
fire
it
be
as
if
a
switch
have
be
thrown
inside
my

i

go
to
make
it
i
would
succeed
i
have
no

what
i
d
do
with
myself

whatever
it
be
i
would

i

school
i

aware
of

no
more
than
three
or
four
mile
from

but
when
it
come
time
to
consider
where
i
might
apply
idecidedtherewasreallyjustonechoice
it
be
only
because
frank
s
brother
be
an
administrator
that
i
have
a
prayer
of
get
in
and
even
so
it
be
dicey
before
i
could
be
accepted
i
be
told
i
d
havetoprove
i

to
attempt
the
task
my
graduation
from
granby
high
be
thus
somewhat
anticlimactic
because
almost
as
soon
as
i
close
my
last
book
i
found
myself
back
in
a
classroom
across
town
a
glance
through
the
granby
yearbook
reveals
my
smile
face
in
a
couple
of
place
but
not
among
the
class
of

then
i
might
have
sense
that
joan
wasn
t
as
indifferent
to
me
as
i
d
be
to
her
back
in
those
dark

before

up

some

saw
me
lean
against
a

outside

in

i
be

to

just
after

i
take
to

immediately
i
found
it
easy
to
concentrate
there
and
to
use
my
time
effectively
and
to
the
great

but
six

a

i

i

i

at

that
i

i
decide

i
be
not

a
family
tradition
in
this
i
d
never
be
encourage
to
consider
a
career
in

but
the
draft
be
in
place
and
while
i
could
delay
service
while
in

i
would
be
expect
to

afterward
that

as
long
as
i

to
go

i
might
as
well
go

i
d
see
townspeople
treat

badly
call
them
goat

and
to
be
candid
i
d
see

earn
some
of
the
disrespect
i
couldn
t
see
join
the

which
seem
oversized
and
featureless
to
me

the

everything
about
the

from
their

john

s
portrayal
of

fearless

in

i
figure
the

corp
be
the
most
demand
of
the

and
would
be
the
great
test

not
found
true
love
she
be
just
back
in
town
after
six
week
in
europe
and
be
attend
the
wedding
with
hermother
it
be
at
the
reception
at
the
norfolk
yacht
and
country
club
that
we
get
a
chance
to
talk
and
i
learn
that
she
d
be
predictably
a
star
at
longwood
president
of
her
class
high
grade
perhaps
even
more
energetic
than
at
granby
and
to
my
own
surprise
i
found
that
this
girl
i
d
overlook
backin
highschool
hadmycompleteandundividedattention
it
wasn
t
until
much
later
that
i
discover
joan
have
spot
me
in
the
church
before
i
saw
her
and
have
engineer
her
place
in

at
the

so
i
d
be
the
usher
who
walk
her
in
she
say
she
be
certain
back
in
high
school
that
i
be
a
good
fit
for
her
and
that
the
three

since
we
d
go
our
separate
way
hadn
t
cool
her
opinion
of
me
she
confesses
to
be
aggressive
i
suppose
i
be
operating
at
a
disadvantage
because
she
be
a
mathmajor
she
knew
howtocalculate
the
hunter
and
prey
get
tougher
to
distinguish

that
however
back
at

after
my
second
plc
boot
camp
i
begin
to

we
rely
on
greyhound
for
weekend
visit
all
that
fall
and
the
follow
spring
it
be
another
age
in
term
of
date
almost
an
extension
of
the
victorian
era
when
i
travel
to
longwood
i
have
to
sign
joan
out
of
her
dormitory

on

evidently
i

my
importance
to
the

with
just
about
a

left
in

about

about
leave

run

i

i

i
mcomingto

we
decide
right
off
that
it
make
sense
for
joan
to
go

withkathryn
i
help
set
her
up

i
d
pay
rent
to
him
for
the
duration
of
her
stay
it
seem
only
right
to
do
that
it
be
my
responsibility
to
take
care
of
my

and
even
if
i
couldn

be

accepted

perhaps
the
lucky

it
didn

seem
that
way
at
all
on
the

it
crawl
by
loneliness
be
a
constant
i
spoke
to
joan
only
once
during
my

in
look
back
i
face
the
decision
of
stay
or
quit
the
marine
while
i
be
still
a
relativenewbie
re
up
be
a
temptation
i
be
proud
to
be
a
member
of
the

i
like
be
useful
to
my
fellow
marine
and
be
i
to
stay
in
uniform
and
return
to
vietnam
for
a
second
tour
i
reckon
i
d
most
likely
get
another
administrative
job
though
that
be
no
certainty
regardless
of
my
specialty
but
it
would
certainly
mean
more
time
away
from
my
family
and
i
miss
joan
miss
baby
kathryn
and
felt
as
if
my
time
overseas
have
place
them
in
hardship
the
fast
way
out
of
the

enough
to

to
count
the

left
the

we
swung
through
an

outside

then
we

do
i
arrive

that
summer

thus

along
with
its

they
d
screw

heck
one
day
i
saw
a
piece
of

on
the

and
bent
over
to
pick
it
up
and
get
into
a
skirmish
i
couldn

understand
it
it
seem
mindless
the

s
stance
wasn

just
anti

it

anti

it

nothing
for

in

the

to

even
if

my

my
confusion

we

so
i

and

i
didn
t
give
joan
a
head
up
before
i
do
it
which
i
felt
bad
about
but
it
be
clear
that
ravenswood
didn
t
offer
the
life
we
sought
we
d
make
some
friend
there
and
the
approach
of
our
second
child
suggest
we
d
enjoy
some
good

but
otherwise

our

be
to

wecan
so
they
re
not

to

i
ve
found
that
if
we
pay
people
well
treat
them
with
respect
and
recognize
that
their
contribution
be

they

earlier
if

at

in

i

of

to
one

in
even
the

he
get

in
one
of
them
in
watertown
new

exactly
dream
up
the
idea
behind
the
five

either
the
inspiration
for
that
come
to
him
from
a

who
visit
the

in
when

alice
didn
t
think
much
of
me
when
i
walk
through
the
door
i
reckon
she
have
me
pegged
as
a
silver
spoon
hire
and
wasn
t
expect
me
to
work
hard
i
surprised
her
i
threw
myself
into
the
job
i
unloaded
truck
stock

price
the
inventory
help
customer
mopped
and
swept
i
never
take
a

i
work
longer
and
harder
than
anyone
there
and
what
s
more
i
enjoy
it
i
found
it
fun
and
within
a
few
day
i
think
alice
come
around
in
her
opinion
of
me
which
be
a
good
thing
because
soon
enough
i
need
herhelp
i
hadn
t
realize
when
mr
perry
offer
me
the
job
how
little
a
role
he
played
in
the
store
s
day
to
day
operation
fact
be
he
played
next
to
none
he
ate
lunch
at
the
counter
every
afternoon
and
he
confer
with
my
bos
now
and
then
in
the
office
and
he
love
visit
with
customer
he
knew
but
he
be
busy
with
his
other
enterprise
and
entrust
most
of
the
actual
work
tothepeople
hehired
another
thing
about
k
r
he
disliked
confrontation
unassuming
and
humble
as
he
be
he
go
to
extreme
to
avoid
come
to
personal
loggerhead
with
anyone
shortly
after
join
the
store
i
realize
my
hire
happen
to
coincide
with
his
have
grown
exasperate
with
the
store
manager
for
whatever
reason
k
r
have
recently
decide
year
into
have
this
gentleman
run
the
business
without
incident
that
the
fellow
wasn
t
who
he
want
for
the
job
now
the
two
weren
t
get
along
in
the
way
people
don
t
when
one
of
them
won
t
say
what
s
eat
at
him
and
can
t
put
it
into
word
evenifhe
wantstospeak
up
the
poor
manager
must
have
see
the
future
when
the
bos
s
son
in
law
show
up
as
his
assistant
and
he
didn
t
mull
his
option
for
long
after
three
or
four
week
he
quit
mr
perry
come
to
me
and
announce
okay
you
rethenewmanager
isaid
excuse
me
what
all
these
year
later
i
understand
his
think
and
might
have
make
the
same
decision
you
can
always
teach
someone
a
business
it
s
a
lot
harder
to
teach
smart
or
drive
or
honesty
the
old
manager
knew
the
business
and
be
certainly
honest
but
he
didn
t
have
the
most
important
ingredient
he
didn
t
have
desire
the
hunger
to
make
of
the
place
something
big
and
well
i
still
nurse
an
unfocused
but
strong
desire
to
succeed
plus
though
i
didn
t
know
the
business
at
all
i
share
a
strong
work
ethic
with
my
father
in
law
i
ve
always
believe
that
hard
honest
work
be
its
own
reward
and
that
it
almostalways
paysdividendsin
time
when
i
balk
at
the
news
k

he

say
and
alicewouldhelp

i
d

he
be
right
alice
do
help
me
for
the
next
several

i

what
i
be
really

mentor
exactly
alice
wasn
t
user
friendly
not
some
sweet
old
grandmother
type
but
evidently
she
decide
i
deserve
the
effort
and
she
school
me
in
all
aspect

really
i
could

have
no

to

me
adjust
those

to
the

at

in

hung
around
when

clean
it

business
picked

almost
immediately
we

have
a
separate
entrance
into
the
toy
department
from
the
parking
lot
out
back
we
encounter
a
few
kink
in
the
new
operation
initially
we
set
up
the
toy
department
s
cash
register
just
inside
the
back
door
and
one
night
somebody
snatch
the
machine
from
the
counter
and
take
off
with
it
we
rearrange
the
room
move
the
register
away
from
the
door
and
institute
a
new
rule
because
the
room
couldn
t
be
see
from
the
front
of
the
store
the
clerk
on
duty
back
there
couldn
t
leave
without
first
be
relieve
by
anotherclerk
the
girl
who
held
most
of
those
job
knew
to
take
the
rule
seriously
because
do
otherwise
would
provoke
alice
one
night
a
man
in
a
trench
coat
wander
in
loiter
among
the
toy
for
a
while
then
flash
the
girl
at
the
register
he
didn
t
seem
in
a
hurry
to
leave
afterward
he
just
stood
there
star
at
her
the

bytheway
such
minor
foible
aside
the
new
department
perform
well
than
we
hop
we
start
advertising
and
business
become
ever
more
brisk
we
offer
layaways
which
be
unusual
at
the
time
we
trade
on
great
merchandise
at
great
price
and
by
the
follow
christmas
we
be
the
go
todestinationinnorfolkforfamilies

business
be
good
enough
that
we
be
already
think
big
a
few
mile
to
the
southeast
a
new
venue
for
retail
be
under
construction
the
region
s
first
enclose
mall
military
circle
a
variety
store
specialize
in
toy
would
make
a
kill
there
we
figure
and
it
would
give
doug
a
store
ofhisowntooversee
when
we
approach
the
developer
lease
the
mall
however
we
found
they
weren
t
nearly
as
enthusiastic
as
we
be
they
saw
no
future
for
a
smallish
local
variety
store
in
their
stylish
new
cathedral
to
retail
especially
see
as
how
they
already
have
a
woolworth
pencil
in
at
a
prime
location
in
retrospect
they
do
us
a
tremendous
favor
because
at
the
time
other
variety
retailer
be
planning
huge
new
store
in
the
area
s
s
kresge
the
old
woolworth
competitor
be
building
kmarts
all
over
the
place
and
mccrory
s
be
set
to
open
a
store
on
the
mall
s
edge
we
d
have
be
eat
alive
so
doug
who
found
he
be
comfortable
in
the
wheel
and
deal
of
lease
negotiation
go
back
to
the
mall
people
with
a
new
plan
what
if
instead
of
a
variety
store
that
specialized
in
toy
we
ditch
the
variety
component
and
just
open
a
toy
store
the
lease
agent
like
the
idea
this
be
late
and
stand
alone
toy
store
be
rarity
but
now
the
mall
s
grand
opening
wasn
t
far
off
and
they
have
no
space
left
for
us
they
do
have
a
storefront
already
commit
to
plum

want

the

when
we

i
have
a
sense
that
it
would
do
well
but
it
be
just
that
a
sense
we
have
practically
no
empirical
data
on

to
predict
how
a
store
sell
only
toy
would
do
in
a

and
we
heard
from
more
than
a
few
people
that
it
wouldn

thatwewereboundtogo
broke
up
to

american
bought
most

do
the
great
bulk
of
their
trade
in
toy
at
christmas
during
the

their
toy
department
would
double

it

every

for
sixty

and
a
great
many
kid
found
inspiration
inits
pageswhenitcametimetomaketheirchristmaslists
but
we
felt
we
could
succeed
we
d
see
the
toy
department
at
ward
corner
grow
in
reputation
and
customer
traffic
and
that
told
us
that
devote
a
whole
store
to
toy
and
locate
it
along
a
big
busy
thoroughfare
of
a
new
clean
air
condition
mall
would
generate
business
not
only
at
christmas
but
throughout
the
year
as
k
r
put
it
we
go
into
it
with
the
idea
that
every
child
will
have
a
birthday
between
now
and
next
december
most
will
have
a
party
with
about
twelve
kid
and
each
kid
will
bring
a

they

so
we
underestimated
just
how
big
a
hit
the
military

be
from
the
first
day
we

and
they
couldn

keep
up
with
our
order
doug
couldn
t
get
the
toy
on
the

fast
enough
that

we
might
have

maybe
even
into
the
upper
management
rank
he

the
military
circle
store
as
an
assistant
manager
it
didn
t
suit
him
he

bore
stiff
by

an
environment
i
told
bryan
leave
just
when
we
be
get

would
be
about
the
bad
mistake
he
could

see
as
how
he

to
fix
a
problem
we
couldn
t
have
foretold
the
synergy
his
presence
would
bring
the
calmness
at
the
center
of
our
collective
culture
he
come
along
eleven
year
after
i
start
at
the
five
and
dime
and
eight
year
after
we
open
our
first
toy
store
but
ray
compton
be
as
much
a
founder
ofwhatwouldbecomedollartreeas
doug
orme
in
his
first
two
year
at
k
k
he
completely
revamped
our
system
no
longer
do
the
individual
store
write
check
to
the
warehouse
no
longer
do
we
maintain
handwritten
ledger
we
be
up
to
thirty
odd
store
now
and
that
old
ben
franklin
plan
be
unwieldy
it
be
everything
we
could
do
just
tokeep
track
ofwherethemoney
wasmoving
ray
simplify
all
that
so
that
now
we
bought
merchandise
put
our
retail
price
on
it
and
ship
it
to
the
store
and
when
the
store
sell
it
the
cash
come
back
to
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
paid
the
vendor
so
straightforward
ray
will
say
that
he
do
nothing
brilliant
but
that
it
work
it
sure
look
brilliant
to
me
he
create
a
system
that
enable
us
to
see

than

of

that
everything

do
in

keep

be

because
the

with
what
amount

obviously
this
be
not
an

i
suppose
it

both
fill

that
we
manage
to
make
it
work
for
year
testify
that
we
have
complementary
strength
and
together
be
pretty
formidable
we
have
similar
helping
of
brain
but
be
wire
differently

at

an
idea
over
in
his
head
to
see
it
from
all
side
i
be
probably
more
attune
to
merchandising
to
the
product
that
would
excite
our
customer
doug
understood
real

far
well
than
i
do
and
be
especially
sensitive
to

we
have
enough
in

that

he
be

be
a
stand
up
guy
in

to
be
smart
a
faithful
husband
and
father
who
follow
a
strong
moral
code
believe
in
treat
people
fairly
take
the
long
term
view
on
decision
i
think
he
see
me
the
same
way
we
have
just
the
right
mix
of
difference
and
similarity
to
hit
on
idea
and
solution
that
neither
ofus
wouldhave
foundon
his
own
still
it
be
a
tremendous
waste
of
time
and
effort
for
us
to
show
up
as
a
pair
for
every
product
purchase
every
real
estate
convention
so
we
decide
to
far
divvy
up
what
need
do
our
first
split
into
area
of
specializationcameintoybuying
let
me
explain
how
the
process
work
in
the
early
day
we
get
our
merchandise
from
wholesaler
who
bought
the
stuff
from
the
manufacturer
the
toymakers
might
have
dealt
directly
with
some
of
the
really
big
retailer
such
as
sears
or
kmart
but
rarely
do
they
bother
with
comparatively
small
outfit
like
k
k
it
be
much
easy
for
them
far
less
complicate
to
deal
withjobbersthatsupplied
severalretail
customer
but
jobber
be
middleman
and
marked
up
any
good
that
pass
through
their
hand
we
saw
the
need
as
we
grow
to
knock
down
our
purchase
cost
on
top
of
that
we
found
that
our
wholesaler
be
have
trouble
keep
up
with
our
demand
so
doug
and
i
start
go
to
new
york
every
year
to
talk
to
the
toy
company
to
try
to
get
their
direct
business
toconvincethemwewereworth
theeffort
the
big
we
get
and
the
strong
our
buying
power
the
easy
it
be
to
make
this
pitch
stick
it
might
seem
strange
that
we
have
to
sell
the
manufacturer
on
the
idea
of
work
with
us
to
sell
their
product
but
that
s
how
it
be
we
d
plead
with
them
to
open
us
up
as
it
be
call
as
direct
account
eventually
we
gotthem
allto
work
withus
but
it
take
several
trip
and
a
lot
of
beg
our
meeting
typically
come
at
toy
fair
a
trade
show
that
be
held
each
february
in
the
toy
building
a
fourteen
story
office
block
at
fifth
avenue
in
new
york
city
s
flatiron
district
all
the
factory
have
showroom
in
the
place
some
big
some
small
depend
on
the
size
of
the
company
and
in
the
case
of
the
big
company
the
showroom
could
be
almost
crazily
elaborate
we
d
make
appointment
with
each
anddoug
and
i
would
wander
the
hall
from
showroom
to
showroom
to
inspect
the
new
product
intheworks
for
thecoming
year
the
toy
business
be
vibrant
in
those
day
with
plenty
of
manufacturer
and
a
fast
grow
roster
of
independent
toy
retailer
it
be
excite
to
be
there
mattel
have
the
most
extravagant
showroom
of
anyone
and
it
would
put
on
these
enormous
presentation
to
coax
order
from
us
we
d
be
met
at
the
door
by
our
account
rep
who
show
off
the
good
take
our
order
and
be
the
guy
we
d
call
with
question
about
shipping
or
the
detail
of
our
account
many
of
the
rep
and
most
of
our
fellow
merchant
be

and
here
we
be
a
pair
of
southerner
try
to
navigate
this
strange
northeastern
world
strive
to
conduct
ourselves
in
such
a
way
that
we
d
be
consider
mensch
we
learn
quickly
how
to
do

and
decent
tobehave
ina

wehad

on

ofbusiness
which
isn
t
to
say
toy
fair
be
all
smile
and
good
cheer
an
ongoing
challenge
in
deal
with
the
big
vendor
be
that
they
always
try
to
dictate
what
we
d
buy
from
their
line
and
if
we
didn
t
go
along
with
their
wish
they
could
squeeze
us
by
deny
us
perk
discount
say
or
advertising
allowance
or
let
us
delay
payment
on
the
whole
year
s
order
until
early
december
whenwehad
plentyofcash
onhand
they
might
refuse
us
the
product
they
knew
we
want
until
we
agree
to
buy
those
we
didn
t
in
our
dealing
with
mattel
for
instance
we
always
want
barbie
she
be
a
franchise
barbie
almost
always
sell
our
account
rep
would
present
the
new
barbie
line
and
we
d
be
ready
and
able
to
buy
but
then
he
d
show
off
another
toy
line
i
ll
call
it
xyz
that
perhaps
we
didn
tlike
so
much
wecould
get
all
the
barbie
we
want
hemightsay
but
onlyifwesupportedxyzatsuch
and
such
alevel
the
vendor
goal
be
to
load
us
up
with
as
much
product
as
possible
the
pressure
be
always
on
to
buy
more
if
we
do
million
worth
of
sale
one
year
they
want
us
to
do
million
the
next
they
d
want
all
the
order
as
early
as
possible
and
we
naturally
want
to
wait
as
long
as
possible
to
place
them
the
whole
process
be
an
ongoing
tussle
over
what
we
need
for
our
business
to
stay
healthy
versus
what
they
need
to
promote
theirlinesand
maximize
order
it
wasn
t
bitter
negotiation
it
be
business
deal
but
a
lot
rode
on
it
get
stuck
with
dud
merchandise
be
no
fun
we
could
if
we
get
really
hung
one
year
use
that
experience
in
our
negotiation
the
next
and
try
to
win
a
discount
on
new
line
get
some
help
as
the
industry
put
it
but
it
be
nosure

it
all

this
back
and
forth
take
time
and
require
a
certain
amount
of

so
doug
and
i
decide
we
d
split
the
buying
pie
to
create
more
time
to
meet
with
the
really
big
vendor
which
we
d
continue
to
do
as
a
team
i
specialized
in

boy

doug
in

us

to
handle

doug
be

you
expect
to

and
they

still
have
to
cough
up
the
dough
for
them
and
figure
out

with
all
the

up
much
of

conversation
at

thus
center
on
marketing
we
d
have
a
chance
to
handle
the
toy
and
eye
the
ad
there
be
always
some
back
and
forth
over
whether
kid
would
respond
to
a
commercial
whether
it
would
create
demand
but
the
decision
on
how
big
an
order
to
place
often
come
down
to
whether
or
not
we
believe
what
the
manufacturer
say
about
its
plan
for
advertising
whether
or
not
all

a

market
and
worth
it
to
toymakers
to
foot
the
expense
of
book
commercial
but
our
store
be
in
small
city
mostly
in
the
south
and
it
wasn
t
a
sure
bet
that
toymakers
would
push
their
product
in
our
market
to
the
same
degree
we
have
to
do
a
little
handicap
over
whether
or
not
a
television
promoteditemwouldreallygeta
pushinourneckofthe
wood
as
we
continued
to
grow
the
big
toy
manufacturer
start
invite
us
to
private
presentation
usually
in
the
fall
precede
toy
fair
they
d
set
up
at
some
cool
location
a
resort
in
arizona
say
and
foot
the
bill
for
us
to
come
out
they
want
our
attention
on
their
product
without
distraction
and
they
be
willing
to
spend
money
to
get
it
they
d
have
us
there
for
two
day
maybe
and
we
d
sit
down
with
our
account
rep
and
talk
business
have
a
wonderful
dinner
enjoy
some
drink
by
the
pool
they
be
fun
to
attend
and
they
work
we
couldn
t
help
be
favorably
impressed
because
they
putonashow
as
time
go
on
these
pre
toy
fair
meeting
fell
earlier
and
earlier
in
the
fall
because
the
toymakers
couldn
t
afford
to
wait
until
february
to
get
order
from
their
big
account
they
have
to
have
some
commitment
before
they
could
take
the
gamble
of
put
a
toy
line
into
production
because
the
lead
time
need
to
build
it
be
immense
the
big
the
account
the
earlier
wemet
withthem
sometimes
a
toy
we
saw
at
these
getaway
be
so
new
that
the
manufacturer
itself
wasn
t
yet
fully
commit
to
it
the
meeting
serve
as
a
test
balloon
the
manufacturer
study
our
reaction
sought
feedback
and
gauge
our
excitement
by
the
size
of
our
order
if
it
didn
t
get
the
necessary
commitment
it
could
theoretically
can
the
idea
but
if
a
new
toy
have
make
it
that
far
the
manufacturer
be
probably
go
to
give
it
a
try
the
question
be
again
how
much
support
it
would
give
the
toy
how
much
advertising
if
a
toy
be
in
trouble
that
would
be
the
first
thing
to
go
regardless
of
what
we
dbeenpromised
we
couldn
t
go
into
a
buying
season
with
a
blank
checkbook
we
have
to
haveaplan
we
get
pretty
skilled
at
planning
we
d
develop
an
annual
sale
budget
which
company
wide
would
amount
to
x
million
of
dollar
and
we
d
have
a
margin
we
d
want
to
aim
for
on
those
sale
subtract
the
margin
from
sale
and
we
knew
how
many
dollar
we
have
available
to
spend
how
much
we
be
open
tobuy
one
of
my
responsibility
be
to
figure
out
how
we
d
divide
that
amount
among
our
vendor
that
s
where
a
merchant
s
touch
his
intuition
for
what
would
sell
become
critical
when
it
come
down
to
say
i
ll
buy
this
item
butiwon
tbuy
thatone
but
it
wasn
t
a
simple
matter
of
pick
winner
from
the
lineup
of
new
toy
each
year
the
big
toymakers
have
retailer
they
prefer
to
work
with
and
we
be
pretty
far
down
the
list
the
reason
advertising
cut
both
way
we
rely
on
the
toymakers
to
back
their
ware
with
ad
blitz
they
rely
on
local
advertising
from
their
retailer
and
while
k
k
advertised
we
didn
t
do
it
on
nearly
the
scale
of
target
kmart
or
sears
who
be
our
big
competitorsthroughoutthe
seventy
the
toy
company
knew
those
big
store
would
carpet
bomb
their
market
with
ad
and
thus
ensure
that
their
toy
would
sell
in
effect
our
competitor
paid
twice
for
the
merchandise
they
paid
for
the
toy
then
invest
more
in
push
the
toy
on
the
public
so
when
it
come
to

on

too
and
thus

they

a
fifteen

hot
toy
for
twelve

and
advertise
the
hell
out
of
it
shopper
would
flock
in

respond
to
the

and
to
the

price
long
past
the
point
that
the
big
store
ran
out
of
stock
that
put
pressure
on
us
if
we
slap
a
percent
markupon
an
item
which
wasnot

we
d
look
foolish
because
wesold
that

they

our

our
relationship
with
the

company
be
thus
a
weird
one
we
need
their
hot
toy
because
we
have
to
have
them
to
get
shopper
in
the
door
but
we
could
get
only
a
fraction
of
the
hot
item
we
want
because
our
money
be
worth
less

whenever
a

hit

a
line
of

would
come
to

sell
both
a
movie
and
the
toy
that
go

in
my

we
thought
it
be

expensive
big

aspect
of
the
sometimes
surreal
business
of

from
the

point
of
view
the
whole
process
rest
on
get
to
know
us
and
pose
as
our
friend
they
d

but
i
say
they
be
pose
because
at
its
core
the
relationship
be
purely
a
business
tactic
we
interested
them
only
so
long
as
we
carry
a
big
pencil
which
be
to
say
we
be
in
a
position
to
buy
their
good

he
share
with
bryan
don
t
ever
let
salesperson
get

your
pocket
that
be
good
advice
because
it
wasn
t
unheard
of
for
account
rep
to
offer
something
more
extravagant
than
a
meal
while
fishing
for
business
and
we
have
to
guard
against
it
they
d
send
lavish
care

at
christmas
fill
with
liquor
expensive
cheese
ham

candy
a

one
of
our
buyer
something
really
over
the

a

a

don

recall
which
story
throughout
the

told
of

this
sort

me
we
own
the
company
after
all
we
have
a
vested
interest
in
keep
everything
honest
and
our
culture
at
k
k
be
such
that
the
buyer
we
hire
to
work
with
us
start
with
bryan
prove
themselves
as
immune
to
temptation
as
we
be
small
as
our

remain
through
the
seventy

eighty
there
be
a

sense
we
be
all
in
the

the
best
safeguard
against
inappropriate
influence
i
believe
then
and
still
do
be
to
have
an
up
front
conversation
about
it
with
our
people

they

recognize
it
when

another
thing
we
do
involve
the
christmas
care
package
which
usually
come
to
the

we
d
have
the
buyer
accept

divide

by

in

they
completely
ignore
him

a

year
later
when

he
found

him
without
so
much
as

how

what

in
august
magnavox
an
american
electronics
company
know
for
its
tv
and

introduce
the
odyssey
the
first

it
be
a
primitive
battery
power
machine
with
a
black

and
a

the

year
another
american
company
atari
introduce

simulated

tennis
on

both
the
home
and
arcade
machine
be
instant
hit
and
together
they
launch
a
video

that
be

at
the

neither

at
k
k
the
magnavox

be
sell
at
department

for
the
most
part
and
the
atari
machine
be
the
province
of
arcade
bar
and
bowling
alley
but
that
change
soon
enough
late
in
yet
another
american
company
fairchild
semiconductor
introduce
its
video
entertainment
system
a
home
game
console
that
combine
microprocessor

with

theforerunner

odds
be
you
don
t
remember
the
fairchild
but
just
a
few
month
later
atari
come
out
with
a
console
use
the
same
technology
its
video
computer
system
later
rename
the
atari
which
be
easy
to
use
elegant
in
design
and
almost
single
handedly
create
a
craze
for
video
game
cartridge
over
the
next
four
year
game
developer
in
the
state
and
japan
hurry
to
meet
the
demand
for
new
game
and
do
so
with
a
string
of
hit
that
remain
familiar
to
anyone
alive
at
the
time
asteroid
space
invader
pac
man
and
finally
donkey
kong
a
game
design
and
market
by
a
japanese
outfitcallednintendo
by
the
fall
of
when
we
met
with
the
big
toy
company
to
order
for
christmas
game
cartridge
be
become
a
toy
store
staple
problem
be
aslew
of
company
be
tryingtorepeatthe
atari
machine
s
success
so
the
market
be
suddenly
flood
with
console
and
the
game
to
go
with
them
remember
mattel
s
intellivision
or
coleco
s
colecovision
we
couldn
t
order
just
atari
and
risk
lose
customer
who
own
one
of
those
other
machine
and
there
be
no
way
of
tell
in
a
market
that
be
out
of
control
which
machine
might
prove
to
be
big
hit
so
we
like
a
lot
of
retailer
stock
avariety
ofconsoles
along
withtheirgames
thewholetoy
industrywentelectronic
thatchristmas
now
i
can
look
back
and
see
that
it
s
plain
what
have
to
happen
the
country
be
mire
in
a
recession
money
be
tight
the
console
and
game
be
expensive
compare
to
traditional
toy
and
the
market
be
split
too
many
way
by
too
many
player
a
few
game
sell
well
space
invader
for
one
but
most
remain
on
the
shelf
late
into
the
season
until
the
big
retailer
dumped
their
stock
slash
price
just
to
unload
the
stuff
the
ripple
effect
of
this
dump
be
brutal
christmas
be
a
disaster
for
toy
store
fromcoasttocoast
so
if
you
have
ask
me
in
early
what
i
thought
of
the
future
of
electronic
game
and
toy
i
would
have
told
you
they
d
show
themselves
to
be
a
brief
and
expensive
fad
that
ultimately
flop
i
would
have
predict
a
return
to
basic
traditional
toy
i
say
as
much
at
a
toy
fair
round
table
that
february
and
if
you
d
flip
through
the

you
d

we

i
be

the

s

hangover
be
momentary
a
lot
of
people
it
turn
out
bought
the
atari
and
other

at
deeply
discount
price
and
they

manufacturer
kept
churn
out
new

until

even
more
company
be
make
too
many
console
by
then
and
for
a
brief
while
we
try
to
keep
up
but
it
be
tough
how
much
should
we
invest
in
game
cartridge
for
each
console
they
sell
for
twenty
to
thirty
dollar
apiece
meaning
they
cost
us
plenty
we
have
a
tremendous
amount
invest
in
inventory
that
didn
t
take
up
much
space
in
the
store
and
because
the
cartridge
be
small
they
present
us
with
a
real
shoplift
problem
theft
wasn
t
confine
to
the
store
either
when
game
go
miss
in
our
norfolk
warehouse
we
built
a
cage
in
which
we
lock
the
most
expensive
merchandise
include
the
game
stuff
even
so
we
detect
shortage
in
our
inventory
and
launch
an
immediate
search
for
the
miss
cartridge
we
found
a
pile
of
them
in
the
dumpster
out
back
someone
on
the
cleaning
crew
have
thrown
them
away

that

the

bythe

and
the

simply
jumped

then
in
nintendo
introduce

ne
and
withthat
awholenewgeneration

so
wasanewgorillainthetoybusiness
nintendo
be
by
no
mean
the
first
asian
manufacturer
we
d
trade
with
the
early
eighty
have
see
us
adopt
the
same
tactic
that
f
w
woolworth
have
nearly
a
century
before
by
venture
overseas
to
buy
some
of
our
toy
directlyfromthesources
andthathadmeant
deal
withthechinese
china
have
long
produce
most
toy
enjoy
by
american
kid
the
package
might
have
say
mattel
or
ideal
or
hasbro
but
by
the
seventy
most
toy
be
stamp
out
and
assemble
in
factory
scatter
across
taiwan
and
a
little
later
the
people
s
republic
so
just
after
christmas
each
year
we
dheadto
hong
kong
for
thechineseversionoftoyfair
the
vendor
we
met
there
be
mostly
small
company
with
showroom
scatter
across
the
colony
most
of
them
in
kowloon
we
d
usually
stay
a
week
or
so
crisscross
the
city
to
make
three
or
four
appointment
a
day
to
see
the
good
which
be
basic
toy
the
perennial
year
round
stuff
that
every
kid
played
with
such
as
train
set
racecar
set
toy
car
plush
animal
squirtguns
swimflippers
andothersummertoys
doll
this
be
not
in
other
word
merchandise
with
a
familiar
american
name
though
mattel
might
buy
from
the
same
factory
we
be
not
buying
mattel
brandedtoysfromthevendors
typically
we
dealt
with
vendor
who
represent
chinese
factory
rather
than
the
factory
themselves
these
guy
would
display
line
of
good
produce
by
different
manufacturer
they
d
already
do
much
of
the
legwork
in
identify
the
product
that
might
appeal
to
american
kid
they
d
present
their
line
to
us
and
we
d
order
from
the
menu
payment
be
by
letter
of
credit
all
the
money
be
up
front
but
the
price
be
so
much
well
than
those
back
home
that
it
be
worth
the
hassle
and
risk
plus
the
toy
be
so
affordable
that
we
could
double
our
money
on
an
item
and
still
sell
it
for
an
amount
that
most
american
shopper
would
consider
a
bargain
once
our
order
be
complete
the
vendor
would
shepherd
the
good
from
the
various
factory
he
represent
and
put
them
on
a
boat
and
we
d
see
them
in
norfolkthreemonthslater
these
trip
to
china
in
the
eighty
laid
the
groundwork
for
our
success
with
dollar
tree
because
we
grow
accustom
to
the
rhythm
and
tone
of
do
business
there

earn
a

the

the

big

every

the

we
have
more
competition
now
and
that
competition
be
get

while
we
struggle
to
make

it
be
akin
to
fight
with
an

if

our

in
short
it
be
much
the
same
disadvantage
we
d
face
with
the
big
american
toy
company
only
many
time
bad
because
we
never
have
the
opportunity
to
forge
a
relationship
with
the
japanese
instead
of
negotiation
we
receive
an
edict
they
rarely
let

i
remember
just
one
christmas
when
we
receive
more
than
the
usual
pittance
of
machine
and
cartridge
one
year
nintendo
have
a
shipment
bound
for
best
product
and
the

couldn

accept
the
order
for
financial
reason
it
be
maybe
two
orthree
day
beforechristmas
when
we
get
a
call
would
we
take
it
heck
yes
we
say
the
shipment
arrive
at
the
norfolk
warehouse
and
everyone
at
headquarters
load
console
and
cartridge
into
their
car
as
well
as
the
company
s

and
race
them
out

we
put

make
no
difference
to

the

it
simply
didn

muchofus

it
get
to
the
point
that
i
flew
out
to
redmond
washington
where
the
company
kept
its
american
headquarters
to
explain
our
situation
face
to
face
to
appeal
to
nintendo
s
sense
of
fairness
we
want
it
to
sell
to
us
on
an
equitable
basis
base
on
our
relative
size
if
we
represent
percent
of
the

i
told
them
all
we
ask
for

i
try
to

of

too
if
it
didn
t
sell
us
product
in
reasonable
number
i
say
it
would
force
us
out
of

it
be
that
simple
and
that
wouldn

be
good
for
anyone
if

out

whittle
down
the

to
an
ever
small
number
of

until
it
would
eventually
see
the

shift

our

toy
be
change
and
it
be
hard
to
keep
up
with
the

and
depress
to
witness
the
rapid
abandonment
of
old
school
product
that
have
foster
imagination
and
creativity
we
couldn
t
get
the
merchandise
we
desperately
need
from
nintendo
some
of
the
big
american
toymakers
be
go
public
come
under
stockholder
pressure
to
increase
profit
merge
give
time
this
consolidation
would
leave
us
with
just
two
or
three
stateside
toy
vendor
and
the
prospect
for
the
same
disregard
we
be
get
from
the
japanese
the

would
feature
huge
toy
company
sell

a

in

the
toy
business
as
we
d
know
it
be
mature
and
sell

wasn
t
so
much
fun
anymore
we
be
still
make
money
in
fact
our
earnings
be
robust
and
grow
but
continued
growth
be
become
an
ever
more
doubtful
proposition
and
as
the
old
say
go
if
you
don
t
grow
youdie
so
doug
ray
and
i
start
talk
about
do
something
different
or
at
the
least
find
a
second
type
of
store
to
open
so
we
d
be
more
attractive
to
mall
landlord
it
would
sweeten
our
appeal
if
we
could
offer
them
two
specialtyretailersinsteadofone
but
what
kind
of
second
store
we
have
no
idea
what
we
might
do
we
talk
about
the
shoe

for
a
while
an
old
norfolk

but
it
be
more
a
conversation
among
ourselves
than
a
deep
look
because
we
didn
t
need
long
to
see
that
the
shoe
business
be
a

like
the

his

of

be
that
he
more
than

about
anyone

could
see

we

if

the

i
can
understand
why
they
felt
that

the

be
off

we
rippedoff
what
they

besides
they

they

their

be

tend
toward
product
they
could
get
really
cheaply
and
others
with
too
thin
a
margin
they
couldn
t

the

and
make
too
little

on
the

their

they

so
in

at
the

look
for

in

we
brought
storyboards
with
us
detail
how
the
store
would
look
how
we
d
display
merchandise
in
bin
like
everything
s
a

or
right
in
the
box
in

us
a
listen
because
we

a

then
they
laugh
in

crazy

they
ask

about
it
it
s
bound
to
be

we
don
t
want
a
junk
store
clutter
up
our
shiny
new
mall
over
and
over
we
heard
variation
on
this
theme
along
with
doubt
that
we
could
keep
the
concept
go
for
more
than
a
year
or
two
inflation
would
destroy
us
our
audience
predict
customer
would
visit
once
but
the
slim
picking
of
merchandise
wouldn
tkeep
them
come
back
here
s
an
early
only
store
though
it
s
tough
to
pinpoint
which
since
they
be
all
in

tiny
jumbled
and
as

maryville
tennessee
and
be
game
to
experiment
with
only

in
both
we
decide
we
could
put
another
store
in
k
r
s
shopping
center
at
ward
corner
the
small
cinema
there

in

these
would
be

of
roughly
two
thousand
square

but
when
it
s
your
job
to
fill
them
with
merchandise
you
can
buy
cheaply
enough
to
sell
for
a

that
can
seem
a
vast
amount
of

the
thing
be
though
we
have
to
sell
it
for
abuck
the
whole
business
come
down
to
that
single
fundamental
idea
the
rest
of
the
retail
world
go
out
and
bought
a
bunch
of
stuff
to
put
on
the
shelf
and
figure
out
what
to
charge
for
it
base
on
what
they
d
spent
we
do
the
opposite
we
knew
what
we
d
charge
we
just
have
to
find
merchandise
inexpensiveenoughtosellforthatprice
from
early
on
we
have
three
test
for
merchandise
first
and
most
obviously
it
have
to
sell
for
a
dollar
so
it
have
to
have
a
first
cost
of
considerably
less
meaning
sixty
five
cent
or
so
top
and
as
a
rule
considerably
less
than
that
before
tax
shipping
and
such
second
it
have
to
have
a
perceive
value
of
high
than
a
dollar
so
anyone
encounter
it
in
our
store
would
be
surprised
it
be
price
so
low
they
d
reasonably
expect
to
pay
more
the
third
test
be
that
it
have
to
be
of
some
quality
some
value
it
have
to
be
something
people
would
want
it
couldn
t
be
junk
otherwise
we
observe
few
rule

the
number
weren
t
as
impressive
at

forty
dollar
video

a
toy

s
annual

be
go
to
be

we
be
spending
fifty
or
sixty
cent
on
the
merchandise
we
sell
for
a
dollar
and
our
operating
cost
be
rock

if
you
d
walk
into
our
headquarters
at
that
point
you
might
have
have
some
difficulty
pick
out
the
space
devote
to
our
dollar
store
operation
it
be
a
couple
of
desk
in
a
corner
of
the
k
k
office
no
more
than
twenty
foot
square
and
i
m
probably
overestimate
occupy
by
three
full
time
employee
alan
and
kay
and
another
woman
laura
hoyle
whom
we
broughtinasliaisonto
thestore
manager
most
people
in
the
building
in
fact
didn
t
treat
it
as
a
separate
company
a
lot
of
our
k
k
employee
refer
to
it
as
the
dollar
department
the
fact
be
however
that
although
it
often
felt
like
an
offshoot
of
the
toy
company
it
be
a
completely
separate
corporation
from
its
first
day
not
one
penny
from
k
k
go
toward
start
our
dollar
store
it
have
to
be
that
way
because
the
ownership
be
different
k
r
be
the
majority
owner
of
k
k
but
he
didn
t
have
a
piece
of
the
dollar
business
he
welcome
the
experiment
encourage
our
success
with
it
but
didn
t
invest
in
it
and
in
fairness
to
him
it
be
vital
that
we
keep
the
book
separate
and
not
have
one
companyprosperatthe
expenseofthe
other
so
when
i
say
that
we
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
k
k
s
exist
infrastructure
togrow
thedollar
chain
i
don
t
meanwe
do
so
without
pay
for
it
we
split
the
cost
of
our
share
activity
billing
a
percentage
to
each
company
accord
to
its
share
of
our
total
business
that
percentage
change
from
year
to
year
in
dollar

s
early
day
when
k
k
be
the
dominant
partner
the
toy

probably
cover
percent
or
more
of

a

our
warehouse
bound
for
georgia
say
carry
merchandise
for
three
toy
store
and
a
dollar
store
the
cost
of
that
shipment
be
carefully
figure
so
each
company
paid
its

this
split
didn
t
stop
at

those
employee
like
me

a

to

of

one

they
sue
us
for
unfair
business
practice
namely
for
rip
off
their

and
have
a

they
believe
be

similar
to
theirs
in

court
in

we
each
present

and

robert

down
the
middle
we
have
everyright
to
bein
thedollarbusiness
hesaid
but
wehadto
change
our
name
because
it
be
confuse
to
consumer
we
threw
a
bunch
of
name
around
i
think
a
lawyer
tom
mcphaul
come
up
with
dollar
tree
and
wentbacktothejudge
say
yourhonor
whatabout
this
the
new
name
wasn
t
a
suggestion
that
everyone
in
the
room
instantly
recognize
as
world
class
we
didn
t
all
turn
to
each
other
cry
that
s
it
fact
be
we
like
our
original
name
and
have
no
intention
of
pull
it
from
most
of
our
store
the
court
s
ruling
require
that
we
change
our
name
only
in
those
market
where
everything
s
a
dollar
be
establish
first
a
half
dozen
city
or
so
most
in
virginia
so
we
kept
opening
only
store
exceptinthose
fewmarkets
but
we
quickly
come
to
believe
the
everything
s
a
dollar
people
have
do
us
a
favor
by
force
us
to
come
up
with
a
new
name
because
the
beauty
of
dollar
tree
be
that
it
make
no
promise
to
the
customer
unlike
only
which
assure
shopper
they
could
expect
one
price
and
one
price
alone
the
new
name
didn
t
mean
anything
really
it
simply
played
on
theoldsayingaboutmoney
growingon
tree
that
lack
of
a
promise
be
important
to
us
because
we
didn
t
know
if
we
d
be
able
to
stick
to
the
dollar
price
point
i
m
talk
very
early
on
here
the
first
year
or
two
when
we
be
sell
nothing
but
closeout

out

and
i
get
to

about
the
future
one
day
andrealizedthat
ifwe
do
have
to
move
off
that
pricepoint
we

of
all
the
question
i
ve
be
ask
about

tree
over
the
year
the
most
persistent
by
far
be
how
long
do
you
think
you
ll
be
able
to
keep
the
price
point
at
a
dollar
even
now
with
the
company
s
thirtieth
anniversarybehind
us
people
can
tbelievewecanstickwith
itindefinitely
i
can
understand
that
because
we
weren
t
confident
about
it
at
the
start
either
the
conventional
wisdom
held
that
it
would
prove
impossible
how
could
we
adjust
for
inflation
with
our
price
lock
at
a
dollar
how
could
we
maintain
a
decent
margin
if
the
dollar
fluctuate
versus
the
chinese
yuan
or
thethaibaht
our
concern
be
exacerbate
by
the
pressure
we
felt
from
vendor
who
push
hard
to
get
us
off
a
fix
price
if
we
charge
two
dollar
they
say
imagine
what
wonderful
thing
they
d
be
able
to
sell
us
our
customer
would
barely
notice
the
price
change
but
my
how
they
d
love
the
range
of
stuff
they
could
find
in
our
store
besides
they
argue
it
be
just
a
matter
of
time
before
circumstance
force
us
to
make
such
a
change
so
why
not
takecharge
anddo
itourselves
don
t
believe
that
kind
of
talk
didn
t
get
us
think
there
be
quite
a
bit
of
it
inside
the
company
even
without
the
vendor
contribution
we
debate
in
the
office
about
whether
or
not
ditch
the
price
point
be
in
fact
inevitable
those
who
believe
it
so
advocate
experiment
with
multiple
price
point
we
should
give
it
a
try
some

there

i
don
t

serious

perhaps
discussion
be
a
well
way
to
describe
it
conversation
even
it
be
low
key
and
collegial
but
even
so
the
price
point
be
clearly
a
subject
on
people
s
mind
and
few
subject
be
more
important
to
the
natureofour

personally
i
view
the

concept
as
sacred
it
be
everything
without
it
we
d
be
just
another

a

how

and
we

surrender
our

we
d
also
damage
our
negotiate
position
with
the
very
vendor
who
be
bitching
about
our

because
as

they
knew
what

they
have

prospective

knew
we

because
we

it
be
clear
to
everyone
on
both
side
of
the

most
importantly
we

we

over
our

who

not

twenty
nine

all
that
i
be

that
the
merchandise
we
d
sell
at
or
two
buck
or
even
three
would
not
be
appreciably
well
than
what
we
be
already
offering
for
one
i
devise
an
experiment
to
test
my
think
i
sent
alan
wood
to
new
york
with
instruction
to
buy
merchandise
we
could
sell
for
one
dollar
for
two
dollar
for
three
and
five
and
to
bring
back
a
sample
of
good
at
each
level
he
return
and
we
spread
all
the
booty
on
a
table
and
ask
people
in
the
office
to
pick
out
which
item
should
go
in
eachpile
they
couldn
t
do
it
everyone
be
shock
even
i
be
shock
and
i
d
come
up
with
the
experiment
it
be
impossible
to
tell
the
difference
between
an
item
we
could
sell
for
a
buck
and
others
we
might
charge
three
or
even
five
time
as
much
for
so
how
could
a
customer
tell
when
she
get
a
good
buy
on
something
she
couldn

the

up

that
we
have
to
stick
with
a

if
someday
we
be
force
by
circumstance
to
shift
it
we
d
do
so
we
decide
but
unless
and
until
that
happen
we
d
stand
firm
on
price
and
as
inflation
and
supply
and
exchange
rate
change
we
d
instead
alter
the
merchandise
we
offer
which
we
could
do
see
because
we
weren
t
beholden
to
sell
any
particular
product
think
about
that
for
a
moment
we
be
a
dollar
store
the
only
thing
customer
expect
on
walk
through
the
door
be
that
everything
inside
would
sell
for
a
dollar
if
they
found
motor
oil
on
the
shelf
one
week
and
believe
it
or
not
in
the
company
s
early
day
they
do
find
quart
of
top
grade
oil
at
dollar
tree
they
wouldn
t
start
think
of
us
as
their
go
to
supplier
for
motor
oil
or
auto
supply
they
d
recognize
that
they

lucky
once
maybe
but
not
necessarily
they
d
get
lucky
again
and

so
when
we
could
no
longer
buy

at
a
price
that
enable
us
to
sell
it
for
a
dollar
and
drop
it
from
our
store
no
tear
would
be
shed
we
d
replace
the
oil
with
something
else
that
we
could
get
at
the
price
we
sought
and
which
packed

no

she

we
could
see
that

have
a
much
much

it
be

by
the
begin
of
the

seem
to
suggest
that
the
little

of
our

could
grow
to
dominate
the

thatwas

andit

off
the
big
question
we
face
be
whether

not
we
could
find
enough
merchandise
to
nourish
our

growth
our
shelf
and

be

by
the
catch
as
catch
can
stuff
we
found
in
closeout
a
little
guy
could
make
out
quite
well
by
trading
only
in
the
castoffs
of
other
company
he
could
buy
in
small
lot
he
could
react
quickly
to
opportunity
a
little
guy
have
some
advantage
over
a
big
company
now
however
we
be
outgrow
our
supply
chain
the
lot
be
too
small
to
supply
us
availability
be
unpredictable
the
product
we
could
find
in
sufficient
bulk
tendedtobeimportsweboughtfromwholesalers
whobumpeduptheprice
which
be
what
drove
me
overseas
to
see
what
i
could
find
to
buy
there
just
as
a
century
before
frank
woolworth
have
be
spur
to
seek
merchandise
in
europe
i
always
aim
to
find
well
good
at
a
well
price
and
because
we
could
now
buy
at
significant
volume
i
thought
we
could
nail
down
much
well
price
for
foreign
good
if
we
bought
and
import
themourselves
price
wasn
t
the
only
consideration
after
year
in
the
toy
business
and
after
deal
with
big
toy
company
that
dictate
what
we
bought
and
how
much
iwantedcontrol
iwantedtobedependentonnoone
so
we
venture
back
to
hong

now
with
two
company
to
buy
for
on
our
first

have
some
feel

even
so
hong

be
a

it

i
have
no
idea
exist
if
i
have
any
doubt
about
the

business
beforehand
my
first
few
trip
back
to
hong
kong
cure
me
of
them
look
what
be
out
there
wait
for
us
look
what
we
could
do
if
we
get
dollar
tree
up
to
top
speed
i
come
home
and
talk
to
doug
and
ray
about
what
i
d
see
convince
them
we
could
have
everything
we
want
by
deal
directly
with
the
chinese
we
could
control
our
product
line
and
slash
what
we
paid
for
them
we
d
have
no
far
worry
about
supply
we
could
buy
in
any
quantity
we
want
pay
very
little
for
it
mark
it
up
to
just
a
dollar
and
still
make
a
tidy
profit
a
few
trip
peryearwouldkeepusfatwith
merchandise
at
the
time
any
chinese
good
available
through
american
wholesaler
cost
far
more
than
those
i
saw
in
hong
kong
because
they
d
go
through
two
three
or
four
markup
buying
direct
eliminate
those
built
in
price
hike
we
d
find
an
item
in
hong
kong
buy
it
put
it
on
a
shelf
in
america
for
a
buck
and
people
go
crazy
they
be
amaze
to
find
the
same
thing
in
our
store
that
they
d
be
spending
three
dollar
for
or
more
we
sell
push
broom
straw
broom
and
dustpan
we
d
bought
there
mop
eighty
count
package
of
cosmetic
wipe
sunglass
sew
kit
with
fifty
spool
ofthread
infiftydifferentcolors
people
be
even
more
amaze
that
we
could
be
make
money
sell
such
stuff
fact
be
we
be
double
our
money
on
close
to
everything
we
sell
and
still
we
saw
the
opportunity
to
do
even
well
not
only
to
spend
less
on
the
stuff
we
found
in
hong
kong
but
to
buy
well
high
quality
merchandise
thatcostnomore
ifnotless
the
key
be
that
the
hong
kong
showroom
themselves
be
apply
a
markup
to
the
good
they
show
us
they
be
run
by
trading
company
which
be
just
another
term
for
wholesaler
they
be
middleman
between
chinese
factory
and
the
united
state
market
almost
all
be
represent
by
westerner
or
english
speak
chinese
national
which
make
buying
from
them
easy
so
few
buyer
for
american
store
look
beyond
hong
kong
when
they
go
to
asia
to
shop
it
be
a
quick
painless
one
stop
journeyinvolvingnoforeign
language
but
i
d
heard
of
another
marketplace
that
promise
to
make
hong
kong
look
like
a
ripoff
on
one
of
our
early
trip
to
the
far
east
i
left
the
others
to
take
care
of
business
in
hong
kong
and
go
off
in
search
of
the
canton
trade
fair
the
canton
trade
fair
also
know
as
the
china
import
and
export
fair
be
a
twice
yearly
meeting
for
buyer
and
factory
that
s
be
held
in
its
present
form
in
guangzhou
about
a
hundred
mile
northwest
of
hong
kong
since
and
be
say
to
date
back
in
one
style
or
another
to
the
time
of
marco
polo
nowadays
it
s
a
big
deal
that
attracts
hundred
of
foreign
buyer
to
a
lavish
campus
of
modern
showroom
and
a
reception
hall
much
like
thejavitscenter
innewyork
it
sa
fancyas
the
tajmahal
in
the
late
eighty
that
wasn
t
the
case
the
fair
be
held
in
a
cluster
of
world
war
ii
era
concrete
building
that
look
like
former
barrack
inside
those
no
frill
structure
be
home
to
huge
room
stuffed
with
booth
set
up
by
chinese
factory
and
their
representative
it
be
an
extremely
low
tech
bare
bulbsetting
but
from
my
first
hour
there
i
could
see
we
d
be
buying
less
from
the
trading
company
in
hong
kong
those
guy
be
mark
up
stuff
even
percent
on
item
we
be
in
the
hunt
for
that
amount
only
to
nickel
and
dime
but
percentage
wise
the
markup
be
immense
an
item
with
a
first
cost
of
forty
cent
in
hong
kong
might
cost
a
quarter
at
the
cantontradefair
iwasstunned
canton
s
buyer
be
westerner
and
middle

the
factory

to
be
chinese

who
spoke
decent

i
have
a
chinese
agent
with
me
on
my
first
visit
and
make
it
a
habit
afterward
because
once
we
get
into
the
nitty
gritty
detail
of
an
order
both
side
need
it
a
lot
of
the
buyershadtheirowninterpreters
to
stand
at
the
fair
be
to
be
awash
in
culture
and
language
and
visual
stimulus
the
buyer
foreign
chatter
layer
over
the
stilted
english
of
the
factory
rep
and
the
insistent
chinese
of
the
interpreter
while
all
around
be
sight
too
vast
and
complex
to
absorb
it
be
like
a
scene
from
blade
runner
onlybusier
and
almost
everything
my
eye
fell
upon
be
a
ridiculously
good
value
it
be
a
real
surprise
what
we
could
buy
this
be
not
the
sort
of
stuff
anyone
back
home
would
associate
with
a
dollar
store
this
be
merchandise
of
real
quality
and
usefulness
price
so
we
could
buy
it
pay
to
ship
it
cover
the
duty
cost
of
land
it
in
the
state
and
still
achieve
a
spectacular
margin
it
might
be
mind
boggling
to
think
we
could
buy
anything
of
last
value
for
thirty
eight
or
forty
cent
but
we
could
since
we
be
buying
in
large
quantity
and
of
course
that
be
more
the
case
in
the
year
that
follow
becauseas

it

i
think
it
s
probably
true
that
they
make
very
little
money
but
i
believe
it
to
be
equally
true
that
without

they
d
have
have
no

certainly
the

in

we

we

all
that

would
stretch
forsomereason
and

that
get
us
think
about
other
place
in
the

where
we
might
show
off

without

we

a

by
this

stock
merchandise

our
think
be
to
build
on
the
thing
people
bought
predictably
the
merchandise
that
so
unlike

as

we
continued
to
emphasize
the
element
of
surprise
continued
to
bring
in
merchandise
of
such
quality
that
our
customer
could
not

however
they
didn

and
they

they

to

because
once
they

they

at
what
we

they
never

people
never

what
surprise
might

wait
early
on
we
actually
ran
out
of
merchandise
sometimes
especiallyatchristmas
as
he
be

and
try
to
get
them

doug
use
to
fuss
at
me
about
not
have
enough
merchandise
for
them
in
january
and
february
i
d
say
doug
we
just
don
t
have
the
good
we
can
t
get
the
good
we
be
chase
our
tail
try
to
buy
sufficiently
early
to
land
good
for
the
start
of
the
next
year
but
we
weren
t
sophisticated
enough
to
keepthatflowgoing
which
of
course
be
bad
in
one
sense
then
again
turn
our
inventory
that
completely
be
the
sign
of
a
healthy
company
we
weren
t
maximize
our
sale
potential
but
we
be
always
get
something
fresh
turnover
be
constant
whichbroughtcustomers
back
andkeptthemcoming
the
takeaway
for
me
be
that
we
couldn
t
worry
about
what
we
didn
t
have
just
sell
what
we
have
and
we
couldn
t
ob
over
what
we
could
havedone
justdo

still
we
have
some
pretty
spartan

at

our
store
start
to
undergo
another
more
noticeable
evolution
in
the
early
ninety
as
well
up
to
now
our
dollar
store
have
be
locate
in
shopping
mall
and
more
often
than
not
in

where
we
also
ran

and
it
wasn

the

for

there
be

those

and
they

either
oftentimes
a
mall
operator
would
make
a

with
the

which
he
need
more
than
anything
to
make

from

the
little

our

be
small
and
have
a
big
margin
but
modest
income
after
all
we
charge
a
dollar
for
everything
and
our
toy
store
be
not
the
money
machine
they
d
be
twenty
year
before
as
our
ability
to
compete
with
toy
r
us
and
the
other
big
box
retailer
begin
to
slip
and
as
we
continued
to
be
shut
out
of
a
healthy
supply
of
merchandise
by
nintendo
we
turnedtodiscount

the
upshot
be
that
mall
rent
and
fee
be
a
heavy
load
and
grow
heavier
we
become
dissatisfied
with
other
aspect
of
indoor
shopping
center
as
well
they
be
restrictive
in
design
it
wasn
t
easy
to
expand
or
shrink
a
store
and
the
frontage
tend
to
be
small
delivery
be
a
major
pain
in
the
neck
especially
at
the
dollar
store
where
we
move
in
a
lot
of
smallcartons
we
d
experiment
with
locate
some
toy
store
in
strip
shopping
center
and
be
pleased
with
the
result
now
a
new
kind
of
strip
mall
be
spring
up
all
over
america
the
power
center
usually
anchor
by
two
or
three
big
box
retailer
such
as
walmart
target
and
office
depot
with
an
assortment
of
small
retailer
in
between
these
shopping
center
be
draw
traffic
and
a
lot
of
tenant
we
thought
might
be
good
neighbor
for
dollar
tree
their
rent
be
far
low
than
those
of
the
enclose
mall
maintenance
fee
be
nonexistent
and
they
offer
other
advantage
as
well
delivery
be
easy
just
pull
a
truck
around
back
and
unload
directly
through
the
store
s
rear
door
rather
than
hassle
with
the
twisty
back
corridor
that
link
a
mall
store
with
the
load
dock
they
be
visible
from
the
street
which
brought
in
not
only
customer
but
job
applicant
whom
we
need
over
the
next
ten
year
we
pull
dollar
tree
out
of
enclose
mall
as
our
lease
expire
and
move
into
traditional
strip
mall
and
power
center
the
trick
be
to
get
a
storefront
as
close
as
possible
to
one
of
the
anchor
preferably
a
variety
anchor
or
a
supermarket
a
place
where
shopper
would
be
go
as
a
matter
of
course
if
those
shopper
be
already
near
our
store
when
they
left
their
car
we
figure
they
just
might
make
a
quick
visit
to
dollartreeon
the
wayinoroutofourlargerneighbor
so
that
become
our
strategy
just
as
a
remora
attache
itself
to
a
shark
to
take
advantage
of
the
big
fish
s
supply
of
food
we
shoulder
up
to
big
box
shopping
magnet
and
the
strategy
work
do
it
ever
in
fact
it
work
so
well
that
some
big
retailer
now
write
a
ban
against
us
into
their
lease
agreement
it
s
annoy
but
i
can
understand
their
position
they
don
t
much
enjoy
sell
merchandise
for
three
buck
that
we
have
next
door
for
one
once
a
customer
see
that
she
begin
to
wonder
about
all
the
other
price
inthat
big
box
store
the
low
overhead
in
the
strip
center
enable
us
to
experiment
with
large
store
throughout
the
ninety
we
try
on
a
variety
of
size
and
configuration
even
within
the
dollar
segment
of
the
retail
market
we
face
some
competition
from
small
chain
and
mom
and
pop
company
and
these
store
especially
the
one
in
ethnic
neighborhood
tend
to
be
large
they
might
be
small
company
but
they
impressed
us
with
the
sheer
size
of
their
outlet
so
as
we
spread
across
the
east
and
venture
west
of
the
appalachian
we
found
ourselves
force
by
competition
to
think
large
from
our
tiny
square
foot
mall
footprint
we
evolve
first
to
foot
and
then
as
our
asian
import
grow
and
we
found
more
and
well
merchandise
to
stock
to
or
that
be
our
standard
size
for
year
in
search
of
the
right
size
we
sometimes
go
too
large
our
few
failure
typically
come
when
we
lease
a
former
grocery
store
and
try
to
fill
that
to
square
foot
space
with
merchandise
nowadays
we
could

we
couldn

we
didn

the
big

weren

from
that
little

at

which

and
where
he
still

at
the

counter
most

to
a
toy

that
peaked
at

throughout
the
southeast
k
r
have
never

but
he
d
always
be
our
spiritual

emotional
leader
and
be
always
a
source
of
encouragement
and

that
held
everyone
together
we

to
leave

a

later
another

occur
that
at
first
glance
might
not
seem
nearly
so
earth
shake
but
which
force
me
to
change
my
role
in
the
company
in
the
first
four
year
of
our
dollar
tree
venture
alan
wood
have
grown
in
importance
to
us
he
report
to
me
but
for
all
intent
he
ran
the
show
since
most
of
my
attention
center
on
the
toy
business
and
the
mount
pressure
we
face
from
competitor
and
supplier
alan
be
dollar
tree
s
chief
buyer
through
its
early
closeout
dependent
day
and
our
first
few
trip
to
the
far
east
he
be
talented
i
like
him
and
the
fact
that
i
place
so
much
responsibility
on
his
shoulder
spoke
to
how
much
i
trust
him
in
retrospect
his
exposure
to
asian
culture
might
not
have
do
him
any
favor
here
he
be
a
guy
who
d
risen
through
the
company
from
the
humblest
of
start
as
a
stock
boy
at
military
circle
he
d
spent
his
entire
work
life
in
southeastern
virginia
and
the
maryland
suburb
around
d
c
and
now
suddenly
he
be
passing
a
lot
of
time
in
hong
kong
and
guangzhou
where
vendor
angle
for
his
business
by
win
and
din
him
and
smother
him
with
compliment
the
big
the
pencil
a
buyer
held
the
more
lavish
their
attention
i
think

so
on

i
take
a
high

in

percent
range
to
balance

out
that
way
the

fell
within
a

the

i

more

every

we

what

we
have

that
the

the

even
by

perhaps

thing
about
these

that
we

we

we

in
the

we

okay
i

so
i

an

up
reorder
in
the
warehouse
it
be
seat

a

we

our
freight

rather
than

with

and
sometimes
those

differ
by
a
wide

one
thing
we
come
to

about

that
any

of

we

the

one
final
point
about
that

it
be
no
cheap
piece
of

this
be
a
big
heavy

available
in

with
a

on
its

the
sort
of
flashlight
a
customer
might
hold
onto
for
year
it
be
an
almost
unbelievable
bargain
at
a
dollar
a
smart
buy
for
us
at
thirty
five

we

the
big

of
that
stuff
in
the
world
we
go
through
million
ofpieces
but
we
also
come
to
see
that
sometimes
the
chinese
didn
t
get
thing
quite
right
one
vendor
understood
that
jesus
be

miscue
weren
t
quite
so
dramatic
but
some
aspect
of
the
executionwould
often
bea
little
off
we
all
but
kay
in
particular
take
to
tweak
the
sample
we
be
show
we
might
like
a
jesus
figurine
for
example
but
would
dictate
the
paint
color
we
want
use
for
skin
hair
eye
sometimes
the
color
of
clothing
on
a
figurine
would
be
a
little
too
bright
for
western
sensibility
and
we
d
order
the
piece
with
more
mute
clothing
instead

we
take

many
of
the

our

supplier
and
say
we
d
really
like
to
have
this
see
what
you
can
do
on
our
next
trip
over
there
it
would
be
we
start
design
our
own
polyresin
figure
as
well
bryan
and
i
be
sit
together
on
an
airplane
flight
talk
about
what
might
excite
american
shopper
and
we
hit
on
lighthouse
the
idea
struck
us
as
perfect
see
as
how
crazy
people
be
for
the
lonesome
romance
of
the
seashore
and
the
beacon
in
particular
bryan
cut
picture
of
lighthouse
out
of
magazine
lighthouse
from
all
over
the
country
and
we
give
them
to
our
trading
partner
a
little
while
later
we
come
out
with
our
lighthouse
collection
and
it
be
a
huge
hit
for
good
reason
too
those
little
statuette
be
beautiful
and
authentic
down
to
the
last
detail
some
of
them
even
take

when
you

trip
i
get
the
notion
that
we
should
have
some
polyresin
turkey
for
thanksgiving
while
meeting
with
vendor
in
guangzhou
i
mention
what
i
want
turn
out
there
be
no
turkey
in
china
it
s
a
western
bird
i
try
to
describe
it
make
gobble
gobble
sound
but
it
be
clear
from
thestaresofthevendors
that
theyhad
noidea
whati
be
try
to
imitate
so
i
round
up
a
picture
of
a
turkey
and
in
shortorder
they
turn
out
a
sample
line
of
turkey
figurine
that
s
not
what
they
call
them
by
the
way
they
didn
t
have
a
word
for
the
bird
so
they
make
one
up
the
english
translation
be
fire
chicken
kay
meanwhile
come
out
with
a

we

we
get
well
with
time
still

we
misjudge
how

we
should
buy
judging
the
quantity
we
need
be
more
or

a

we
could
sell
a

if
we

thousand
we

it

often
maybe
with
percent
of

but
when
it
do
we
face
the
challenge
of
get
it
off
the
shelf
make
all
the
more
difficult
because

one
of
the
thing
we

store
the
idea
almost
always
come
from
someone
with
an
up
close
view
of
our
day
to
day
habit
we
try
to
promote
independent
thought
and
initiative
in
our
people
to
impress
upon
them
that
whatever
their
decision
be
and
of
course
they
have
to
make
decision
everybody
do
if
they
do
it
for
the
right
reason
with
honesty
and
integrity
they
llgenerallycomeout
okay
they
have
prove
themselves
worthy
of
trust
in
all
but
the
rarest
of
case
and
have
repaid
anything
we
ve
give
them
with
a
dedication
to
hard
work
and
customer
service
that
be
the
envy
of
the
industry
so
as
i
continue
with
this
storyand
the
flurry
of
development
that
saw
dollar
tree
become
a
retail
giant
bear
in
mind
that
throughout
the
real
story
of
the
company

success
be
play
out
every

consider
how
well
dollar
tree
be
perform
and
how
lucrative
that
be
for
doug
ray
and
me
it
might
seem
counterintuitive
that
in
the
middle
of
not
yet
six
year
into
run
the
company
we
be
actively
look
for
someoneto
buyapieceofitfromus
we
have
many
reason
first
and
most
importantly
we
want
the
best
for
the
business
we
d
start
it
on
a
shoestring
with
little
direct
investment
and
have
see
it
grow
beyond
our
dream
it
have
be
a
fun
excite
and
deeply
gratify
experience
but
now
with
dollar
tree
have
eclipse
k
k
s
size
in
a
handful
of
year
we
have
reach
a
point
at
which
the
company
s
continued
growth
be
beyond
our
experience
and
require
a
more
season
hand
we
knew
nothing
about
big
really
big
business
i

no
more
professional

than
i
do
ray
be
a
fantastic
financial
planner
and
disciplinarian
but
be
almost
as
far
out
of
his
element
as
we
be
and
with
few
exception
our
senior
management
team
be
likewise
inexperienced
some
of
our
most
important
people
have
topped
out
education
wise
in
high
school
they

we

the
second

and
it
be
a
distant

be
that
doug
ray
and
i
have
all
of
our
personal
asset
tie
to
dollar
tree
we
d
collateralize
everything
we
own
to
get
bank
loan
to
finance
our
expansion
and
while
it
s
nice
to
be
comfortable
on
paper
it
s
a
lot
more
so
to
be
comfortable
in
liquid
form
when
your
house
and
future
be
mortgage
to
your
business
it
s
like
that
old
tennessee
ernie
ford
song
you
owe
your
soul
to
the
company
store
so
no
bone
about
it
we
want
to
take
some
chip
off
the
table
we
want
to
have
money
in
our
personal
bank
account
we
want
to
find
someone
to
share
the
benefit
and
also
the
risk
of
grow
dollar
tree
to
its
full
potential
we
be
willing
to
surrender
a
stake
in
the
company
in
exchangeforthat
this
wasn
t
a
thought
that
just
occur
to
us
in
in
fact
we
d
first
sought
a
partner
back
in
less
than
a
year
after
start
the
dollar
business
we
d
forge
an
understand
with
the
jordan
company
a
new
york
investment
firm
we
be
in
new
york
that
october
ready
to
close
the
deal
when
the
market
collapse
on
the
infamous
black
monday
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
suffer
its
bad
one
day
decline
in
history
our
financing
evaporate
on
the
spot
we
close
the
book
on
the
deal
and
flew
hometonorfolk
we
wentlooking
again
in
just
afterk
r
cashed
out
this
time
our
potential
partner
be
a
new
orleans
investment
company
jefferson
capital
partner
we
be
on
the
phone
with
one
of
its
people
go
over
deal
point
when
he
suddenly
holler
oh
my
god
we
ve
just
bombed
iraq
i
haveto
getoffthephone
thatended
that
so
we
d
come
close
to
acquire
a
partner
twice
before
and
have
see
global
event
derail
our
plan
now
we
start
sniff
around
again
we
thought
the
most
straightforward
approach
might
be
to
find
a
big
retail
operator
to
play
the
role
of
synergistic
partner
but
we
couldn
t
find
any
we
be
comfortable
with
or
that
be
willing
to
take
us
on
so
we
look
for
a
privateequity
firmtorecapitalizeus
a
recapitalization
partner
an
investment
firm
with
an
entrepreneurial
company
that
isn
t
reach
its
full
potential
the
firm
buy
into
the
company
offering
cash
in
exchange
for
a
piece
of
the
action
typically
it
acquires
a
majority
stake
in
the
business
so
it
can
call
the
shot
though
the
company
s
management
remains
in
place
the
investment
along
with
the
firm
s
expertise
and
guidance
enables
the
company
to
expand
without
its
boss
be
personally
liable
if
the
business
tank
in
exchange
the
firm
see
the
value
of
its
investment
grow
assume
the
business
succeed
and
returnstheearnings
fromthatinvestmenttoits
ownbackers
these
arrangement
be
not
meant
to
be
permanent
the
investment
firm
typically
stick
around
for
a
few
year
help
grow
the
company
then
exit
the
partnership
by
take
the
company
public
and
sell
its
share
or
by
simply
sell
out
to
a
hungry
buyer
either
option
yield
more
money
than
the
investor
have
at
stake
and
thus
give
them
a
second
bite
of
the
apple
of
course
none
of
this
be
as
simple
as
it
sound
to
successfully
go
public
a
company
have
to
show
strong
consistent
performance
to
convince
the
stock
market
it
s
a
good
bet
it
must
grow
in
value
at
a
rate
that
make
potential
buyer
of
stock
sit
up
and
notice
but
these
daunt
expectation
for
growth
and
performance
be
part
of
what
attract
us
to
a
recap
ultimately
it
would
force
ustobe
well
when
we
sell

thing
i
should
point
out
be
that
the
bottom
line
be
the
same
with
both
potential
partner
we
figure
dollar
tree
s
enterprise
value
at
roughly
million
a
figure
that
include
all
of
its

its

and
the
cash
on

that
we
founder
plan
to
pull
out
of
the

once
the

we
plan

that
wasn
t
subject
to
much
negotiation
we
be
confident
the
company
be
worth
every
penny
we
say
it
be
in
fact
year
later
people
would
ask
why
we
want
to
sell
the
company
for
so
low
a
figure
suggest
in
that
question
that
we
d
fleece
ourselves
we
didn
t
the
question
apply
knowledge
of
what
come
later
to
a
deal
with
more
uncertainty
than
guarantee
and
to
a
time
when
we
remain
a
pretty
modest
undertaking
at
the
end
of
we
operate
store
our
annual
profit
stood
at

wewerenowhere
nearthedollartreeeveryoneknowstoday
the
whole
reason

that
before

some
serious
internal
turmoil
ugly
intergenerational
family
stuff
that
look
to
sink
the
whole
firm
we
wonder
if
they
be

we
wonder
if
they

survive

john

after
we

how
thing
be
come
together
when
he

have
to
admit
that
our

immediately
resume
his
pursuit
of
dollar

and
we
be
happy
to
be
pursue
doug
ray
and
i
view
saunders
karp
as
the
lead
candidate
after
the
first
deal
do
in
fact
unravel
what
the

lack
in

it
address
with
intense
study
of
our
business
it
understood
our
concept
and
love
it
and
it
brought
a
broader

we
fascinate
them
we
seem
to

defy
gravity
as
tom
saunders
put
it
it
s
hard
to
understand
how
you
can
improve
your
quality
and
your
margin
and
never
change
your
price
year
in
and
year
out
no
matter
what
s
go
on
in
the

the
whole

be
counterintuitive

it
take

they

the

whether

we
should

so
john

assume
we
d
continue
openingseventy
store
a
year
and
that
those
store
would
do
about
the
same
which
be
to
say
very
well
as
those
we
d
open
to
date
scenario
two
assume
circumstance
that
saw
our
opening

at
a
slow
pace
and
those

at

three
saw

opening

atthesametime
thenewstores

not
surprisingly
the
model
paint
different
future
if
we
hit
our
in
house
projection
saunders
karp
would
make
ton
of
money
for
its
institutional

everyone
would

that

operator
it
be
impressed
by
our
past
performance
it
believe
us
to
be
honorable
but
other
discount

have
go

and
none
of

could
predict
how
public
taste
international

or
global
economics
might
change
in
the
year
to
come
actually
saunders
karp
have
another
concern
and
it
be
the
big
a
potentialdealbreaker
i
want
any
alliance
whether
it
be
with
saunders
karp
or
someone
else
to
be
a
true
partnership
fifty
fifty
us
and
them
equal
no
majority
partner
no
minority
partner
no
one
control
anyone
else
no
one
give
the
order
and
no
one
take

the
way
i
saw
it
if
we

thendamnit
let
sbe

i
knew
this
wasn
t
the
way
most
recapitalizations
work
typically
an
investment
firm
take
at
least
percent
of
the
control
often
it
take
a
lot
more
than
that
it
might
leave
the
company
s
management
in
place
but
the
realshots
be
calledbythemajorityowners
that
typical
structure
didn
t
interest
me
i
d
rather
have
do
without
a
partner
than
give
up
control
i
want
to
share
the
business
not
surrender
it
and
i
didn
t
want
to
have
our
side
serve
as
majority
owner
either
i
want
both
side
truly
to
be

this
thing
together
saunders

i
tookthatatfacevalue
tom
saunders
do
not
share
that
view
he
want

to

a

because
he
fear
that
a
fifty
fifty
split
might
lead
to
stalemate
he
come
to
me
and
say
we

or
you
can

and
the

andover
we
be
able
to
calm
the
firm
s
other
fear
about
the
deal
we
explain
that
we
could
offset
inflation
by
buying
in
large
volume
and
tighten
down
on
inefficiency
and
unnecessary
expense
we
show
it
that

retailer
hadn
t
tanked
because
their
business
model
be
bad
but
because
their
execution
be
flaw
but
on
the
question
of
equal
ownership
wewereatan
impasse
in
a
way
i
suppose
tom
s
fear
have
come
to
pas
he
worried
that
if
the
board
deadlocked
on
a
decision
we
could
put
the
company
in
jeopardy
he
fear
for
instance
that
if
we
fail
to
meet
our
performance
target
saunders
karp
would
have
to
earn
the
full
board
s
assent
before
it
could
adjust
the
company
s
strategy
if
we
didn
t
sign
off
on
the
firm
s
plan
we
dbedeadinthewater
whichbrought
upa
relatedpoint
doug
ray
and
i
be
adamant
that
we
not
be
told
how
to
run
the
business
we
knew
how
to
do
that
well
than
anyone
as
we
go
back
and
forth
over
ownership
i
become
ever
more
unyielding
on
this
in
fact
the
longer
the
negotiation
drag
on
and
the
wearier
i
grow
of
the
whole
process
the
more
i
wonder
if
we
need
a
partner
at
all
i
begin
to
question
our
need
for
outside
money
i
grow
unconvinced
that
we
should
share
our
profit
when
our
return
on
investment
be
so
quick
it
seem
to
me
that
we
might
be
able
to
finance
our
own
expansion
and
relieve
ourselves
of
any
worry
over
ownership
and
control
mostly
though
iwas
sickto
deathoftoomuch
talkandtoolittleaction
we
be
still
hung
up
when
as
part
of
his
due
diligence
john
megrue
ask
for
a
tour
of
a
representative
dollar
tree
store
outside
of
southeastern
virginia
so
that
he
and
barron
fletcher
could
gauge
how
much
white
space
we
require
that
s
an
industry
term
for
how
close
to
each
other
our
store
could
operate
without
steal
customer
from
each
other
do
a
store
require
a
two
or
three
mile
radius
or
do
it
have
to
be
twenty
i
decide
we
dvisitstoresin
thedetroit
area
john
barron
fletcher
and
i
explore
several
store
there
over
a
couple
of
day
in
early
september
they
be
clearly
excite
by
what
they
saw
the
store
be
busy
with
shopper
who
be
do
what
dollar
tree
shopper
do
react
with
shock
and
delight
to
what
wait
on
the
shelf
come
in
for
one
item
and
leave
with
several
buying
far
more
than
they
dplanned
ihave
tobehonest
even
iwasimpressed
afterward
in
a
lounge
at
detroit
metro
airport
john
and
i
wait
for
our
flight
home
he
be
obviously
eager
to
get
back
to
new
york
to
share
with
his
partner
what
he
d
see
i
have
come
to
like
john
a
great
deal
over
the
course
of
our
conversation
have
come
to
feel
we
have
a
real
chemistry
and
be
pleased
thathewasblown
awayby
whatweweredoing
every
day
but
despite
his
excitement
he
seem
resistant
to
commitment
he
didn
t
want
to
be
rush
and
i
be
through
wait
i
d
have
enough
i
have
a
trip
to
asia
come
up
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
i
be
so
fed
up
that
if
we
didn
t
have
something
pin
down
by
the
time
i
left
i
be
willing
to
walk
away
so
i
turn
to
john
and
say
either
we
finish
in
the
next
three
week
or
the
dealisoff
this
announcement
surprised
john
to
say
the
least
i
knew
him
reasonably
well
he
say
of
me
and
the
episode
now
he
s
a
pretty
mellow
and
balance
person
some
people
you
don
t
see
as
have
that
style
genetically
inthem
buthe
d
obviously
thoughta
lot
about
it
i
later
learn
that
on
his
flight
back
to
new
york
he
wonder
if
the
deal
so
long
in
the
work
might
collapse
wonder
if
his
partner
would
balk
at
join
force
with
a
guy
who
resort
to
ultimatum
eventually
his
takeaway
be
practical
he
have
a
deadline
to
meet
in
our
business
there
be
time
you
need
for
various
reason
to
do
thing
that
might
not
be
in
one
s
ideal
zone
or
time
frame
or
price
he
say
but
you
have
to
make
sure
you
keepthemajoritems
separatefromtheminoritems
in
contrast
on
my
flight
back
to
norfolk
i
couldn
t
have
felt
more
relaxed
it
be
clear
to
me
that
without
a
firm
deadline
the
talk
would
drag
on
and
as
i
ate
the
little
bag
of
pretzel
the
flight
attendant
pass
me
i
realize
that
doug
ray
and
i
along
with
dollar

would
be
fine

as
it
happen
john
s
partner
saw
more
benefit
than
danger
in
the
deal
despite
our
insistence
that
ownership
be
evenly
split
we
reluctantly
agree
tom
saunders
say
now
in
my
well
judgment
it
didn
t
make
sense
butwedecided
todoit
i
ll
let
him
explain
the
reason
in
most
of
these
thing
tom
say
it
all
come
down
to
relationship
big
number
be
thrown
around
all
the
time
but
well
deal
and
partnership
and
well
experience
together
be
because
ofrelationships
it
be
all
about
character
and
integrity
someone
you
can
depend
on
to
do
what
he
say
and
never
attempt
to
one
up
you
or
take
advantage
of
a
situation
you
can
take
what
they
say
to
the
bank
and
it
be
our
view
that
the
character
of
these
founder
all
of
them
be
great
we
knew
that
we
could
take
them
at
their
word
that
they
d
always
be
straight
up
with
us
and
lay
it
on
the
line
and
we
would
try
to
respond
with
the
same
behavior
and
i
think
that
bond
the
recognition
of
that
be
what
provoke
us
to
take
what
we
perceivedasarisk
if
we
get
into
this
and
it
wasn
t
work
out
it
would
be
very
difficult
all
the
textbook
tell
you
not
to
do
this
you
have
the
risk
of
do
damage
to
the
institution
if
the
arrangement
be
dysfunctional
the
only
way
we
get
over
that
concern
be
becauseof
who
they
be
and
we
feltcomfortableina
relationship
that
be
not
structurally
sound
in
term
of
control
but
be
very
strong
intermsofcharacter
even
if
you
get
into
a
tough
situation

the

taught
us
the
way
of
the
world
of

business
and
left
us
to
run
our
store
as
we
saw
fit
with
one
difference
because
it

we
d
everimagined
we
might
have
continued
to

without
saunders

but
if
there
s
a
pivotal
point
to
this
story
the
merger
s
magical
fusion
of
talent
and
vision
be
it
without

which
in

tom
call
the
union
the
best
relationship
we
ever
have
with
anyone
and
i
can
t
imagine
its
have
go
well
year
later
tom
and
i
participate
in
a
case
study
of
the

at
the
university
of

s
darden
school
of
business
we
head
to
charlottesville
and
go
into
the
classroom
and
the
professor
split
all
the
student
into
two
camp
some
on
the

side
some
skm
each
of

analyze
the

that
face
us
as
we
negotiate

to
answer
the
pivotal
question

then
we
all
go
into
a
large
auditorium
where
tom

i
explain
what
we
have
do
and
why
many
of

be
surprised
quite
a

would
not

the

continue

especially
as
we
push
farther
west
there
be
a
time
early
in
our
history
when
i
d
resist
the
notion
of
a

i
be
leery
of

fast

l
we
run
into
the
same
trouble
that
have
doom
everything
s
a

but
it
be
clear
that
we
d
now
reach
the
point
where
we
d
be
doom
if

step
wewerestretchedwaytoothin
we
recognize
this
new

have
to

requirement
it
would
have
to
be
accessible
to
interstate
highway
and
easily
reach
from
major
port
it
would
have
to
be
far
enough
west
of
our
virginia
headquarters
to
enable
us
to
rationally
divide
up
our
territory
so
we
wouldn
t
spend
too
long
on
the
road
to
reach
any
group
of
store
and
it
have
to
facilitate
our
opening

in

part
of
the
country
not
only
to
ease
ourcurrentlogisticalloadbuttoenableustogrow
we
conclude
that
the
logical
location
be
the
memphis
area
which
be
close
to
both
east
west
and
north

just
a

from

an
infinitely
more
complex
company
to
operate
we
have
eleven
gargantuan
distribution
center
today
sprinkle
from
coast
to

but
the
most
difficult
transition
wasn
t
go
from
two
warehouse
to
those
eleven
it
be
go
from
one
to
two
we
have
to
develop
new
system
for
shipping
merchandise
to
the
united
state
from
around
the
world
so
an
appropriate
share
of
the
stuff
we
bought
would
be
delivereddirectlytoeachwarehouse
think
about
that
for
a
moment
our
trading
agent
in
china
now
have
to
split
our
shipment
among
container
head
to
different
destination

that
be
come
to
the

from
dozen
of

the
job
suddenly
become
way
way
more
complicate
and
here
at
home
we
have
to
develop
new
trucking
route
that
make
the
optimal
use
of
time
and
fuel
where
we
previously

however
he
beg

that
the

he
be
right

our

the

depend
to
a
large
degree
on

the

we
need
system
we
could
put

right
away
but
would
be
expandable
as
we
open
additional

in

so
it
be
that
stephen

join

as
our

a

but
the
experience
prove
useful
to

it
make
me
very
objective
as
far
as
how
to
run
a
business
he

and
i
learn
an
awful
lot
about
what

still
he

down

that
the

in

in

who
the

be

you
ask

for

and
always
rely
on
one
another
to
take
care
of
our
respective
piece
of
the
business
neither
of
us
be
in
a

to
tell
the

what
to
do
and
wouldn

have
be
inclined
to
do
so
anyhow
our
new

weren
t
look
to
change
the
dynamic
we
enjoy
any
more
than
necessary
for
example
they
weren
t
interested
in
acquire
title
themselves
they
merely
take
place
on
our
board
and
i
think
they
admire
the
way
we
three
lead
the
company
as
a
unit
a
meld
of
personality
but
about
one
thing
they
be
firm
and
consistent
dollar
tree
need
to
have
one
leader
one
public
face
that
leader
should
hold
the
rank
of
ceo
and
that
ceo
shouldbeme
to
tom
saunders
the
issue
seem
pretty
straightforward
he
and
his

at

weren
t
in
the
business

operation
with
the
expectation
that
they
d
be
able
to
help
us
boost
our
income
thereby
provide
their
investor
with
a
good
return
eventually
they

remove
themselves
from

either
by

all
of
this
depend
on
their
spur
us
to
grow
at
a
much
great
pace
than
we
d
manage
so
far
that
commitment
to

and
the
prospect
of
our

place
real

always
be
a
vital
component
of
our

what
most
excite
our
new

be
what
we
chose
to
sell
in
the

and
our

you

if
saunders
karp
take
us
through
the
process
of
become
a
public
company
we
d
have
to
sell
ourselves
in
an
entirely
new
way
to
the
american
public
the
style
and
confidence
with
which
we
make
that
pitch
would
be
essential
we
need
a
spokesman
your
ceo
have
to
play
that
role
and
he
have
to
be
believable
tom
say
it
s
like
pick
the
quarterback
of
your

who
can
throw
the
tightest
spiral
and
still
stay
in

in
the
toughest
condition
and
get
the

he
felt
that
i
have
the
best
chance
ofbeingthequarterbacksuccessfully
anddoingwhatweneededdone
when
i
reflect
on
the
thirty
year
since
we
start
the
company
that
decree
from
our
new
partner
ushered
in
my
great
period
of
discomfort
i
understood
why
they
insist
on
it
i
come
to
understand
why
they
thought
i
be
the
guy
for
the
job
but
because
our
partner
be
mandate
that
one
of
doug
s
title
be
transfer
to
me
title
suddenly
become
very
important
indeed
the
issue
be
that
doug
and
i
be
family
i
d
be
married
to
his
sister
for
thirty
year
he
and
i
have
work
side
by
side
for
his
dad
for
more
than
twenty
year
have
found
dollar
tree
together
as
a
stepchild
of
the
perry
family
business
our
role
have
be
entirely
interdependent
the
business
would
not
have
flourish
without
him
or
without
me
so
the
idea
that
just
one
of
us
be
now
go
to
be
the
bos
do
not
go
down
easy
for
any
of
us
if
we
could
have
kept
on
go
as
we
be
i
would
have
vote
that
we
should
it
wascomfortable
itworked
but
only
for
us
for
our
new
partner
comfort
wasn
t
much
of
a
priority
they
want
result
they
want
the
company
s
sale
to
grow
at
percent
a

they
want
us
to

all
of
which
make
sense
but
the
situation
create
a
tension
between
doug
and
me
that
we
d
never
felt
before
and
that
i
still
lament
to
this

doug
retain
the

as
such
an
undiminished
voice
in
dollar

s
leadership
he
be
as
important
to
the
company
as
ever
but
i
think
his
perception
of
his
place
at
the
table
be
alter
by
the

and
it
probably
didn

in
scale
its
automation
be
even
more
mind
blowing
a
generation
ago
when
we
brought
that
first
center
on
line
i
delegate
the
entire
task
to
steve
white
as
i
do
with
anyone
work
with
me
i
trust
him
to
get
the
job
do
he
be
the
expert
not
me
and
besides
i
never
saw
much
sense
in
attempt
to
do
other
people
s
jobsforthem
still
i
be
nervous
as
the
time
approach
in
january
for
the
roller
derby
to
kick
into
gear
i
ask
steve
more
than
once
be
you
sure
this
thing
be
go
to
work
and
i
told
him
more
than
once
steve
this
thing
have
betterwork
they
be
waste
worry
when
we
flip
the
switch
on
our
first
automate
dc
it
work
just
as
advertised
in
the
old
warehouse
it
would
have
take
three
shift
to
move
twenty
thousand
carton
in
the
first
week
at
the
new
dc
we
move
that
many
in
a
single
shift
on
four
separate
occasion
right
from
the
start
at
chesapeake
and
all
of
our
dc
since
we
ve
fill
store
order
correctly
and
on
time
to
percent
of
the
time
not
a
bad
average
what
we
learn
at
chesapeake
inform
our
design
and
system
at
all
of
our
later
dc
today
the
scale
of
our
logistical
operation
be
almost
unfathomable
in
we
import
forty
thousand
shipping
container
of
merchandise
forty
thousand
just
juggling
the
container
be
a
huge
task
at
each
dc
we
want
the
twenty
odd
container
that
arrive
today
empty
today
so
we
can
have
the
empty
ready
for
pickup
tomorrow
an
incoming
truck
will
drop
off
a
full
container
and
haul
away
an
empty
we
have
a
negotiate
deal
with
a
single
trucking
company
for
each
of
our
dc
and
we
re
usually
amongthatcompany
s
biggestclients
right
now
we
have
more
than
million
square
foot
of
warehouse
under
roof
with
our
eleventh
dc
have
just
go
on
line
in
we
ship
million
carton
of
merchandise
we
ship

just
out
of
the
gargantuandcin

the

be
now
our
small
it
service
store
less
than
half
the
load
carry
by
marietta
but
the
warehouse
operation
be
only
half
the
story
when
we
open
it
because
the
dc
share
the
site
with
our
corporateheadquarters
which
open
atthesametime
our
new
office
require
almost
as
much
thought
as
the
automate
logistics
because
we
need
a
home
that
would
enable
us
to
run
a
big
company
and
give
us
room
to
get
big
but
one
that
would
still
reflect
our
trait
since
the
k
k
day
which
doug
ray
and
i
view
as
real
strength
we
want
a
home
that
foster
communication
among
different
piece
of
the
operation
we
want
a
certain
level
of
informality
an
atmosphere
that
encourage
everyone
to
mingle
we
want
it
to
feel
like
a
small
family
run
business
intimateandfriendly
butto
work
efficiently
and
the
square
foot
headquarters
give
us
all
we
sought
at
its
center
be
a
soar
atrium
topped
by
high
window
and
flood
with
sunlight
which
serve
as
a
sort
of
town
square
for
the
company
it
be
a
natural
gathering
spot
and
meeting
place
just
off
the
atrium
be
a
soda
fountain
with
refrigerator
for
brown
bagger
and
a
mock
up
of
a
dollar

we
felt
it
important
to
have
a
constant

most

plenty

it

we

we
be
interested
but
that
their
current
style
be
so
different
from
ours
that
integrate
their

into
dollar

would
tax
us

take
everything
we

and
transform
the

over
the

when

we

it

close

the

one
and
sure
to
chew
into
its
business
a

of

eventually
we

we

in
just
thirteen

actually
up

from
the

that
didn

mean
we
didn
t
experience
some
hiccup
sometimes
the
language
barrier
cause
headache
on
one

we

to
collect
us
in
the
hotel
lobby
so
we
come
down
from
our
room
and
found
this
driver
we
told
him
our
name
he
nod
we
climbed
into
his
limo
and
off
we
go
he
snake
through
the
street
and
over
a

to
hong

and
we
get
to
a
high
rise
the
driver
escort
us
to
the
fourteenth
floor
where
we
met
a
group
of
chinese
businessmen
they

at

and
shook
their
head
at

our

to
the

to
pick
up
the

passenger
and
pretty
much
threw
us
out
the
mix
up
have
be
their
driver
s
mistake
but
they
didn
t
care
we
be
abandon
to
find
our
own
way
to
our
appointment
i

hop
mad
outside
i
try
without
success
to
hail
a

until
kay
step
in
and
told
me
that
no
one
would
pick
us
up
as
long
as
i
be
wear
such
a
scowl
she
manage
to
flag
a
taxi
but
we
never
make
themeeting
that
be
a
rare
event
thankfully
mostly
because
we
have
good
trading
partner
who
look
out
for
us
i
rarely
go
on
a
buying
trip
on
which
i
didn
t
have
one
of
our
chinese
trader
at
my
elbow
introduce
me
to
people
i
need
to
meet
steer
me
away
from
people
i
didn
t
and
help
me
bridge
the
language
and
cultural
chasm
separate
us
from
the
manufacturer
unfortunately
even
a
trading
partner
didn
t
protect
us
all
the
time
especially
when
the
problem
be
that
trading
partner
through
most
of
the
ninety
the
most
important
of
our

this
be
the

chosen
year

it
be

trading
that
serve
as
our
eye

we

for
an

the

we

like
we

put
a
stop
to
it
even
if
we
d
be
fully
aware
of
whatwasgoing
on
thatwas
the
chinese
style
of
business
my
philosophy
be
that
we
need
the
merchandise
if
we
get
it
and
it
sell
and
we
make
our
margin
on
it
i
couldn
t
worry

what
low
price
i
might
have

able

i
have
to
run
the

the
point
be
that
vincent
be
make
quite
a
bit
of
money
off

i

vincent
go
bad
i
don
t
know
what
happen
or
why
but
i
do
know
that
before
the
british
hand
hong
kong
over
to
the
chinese
in
many
people
there
get
nervous
they
didn
t
know
whether
hong
kong
would
be
allow
to
continue
do
business
and
they
d
be
able
to
carry
on
with
their
capitalistic
enterprise
or
whether
the
people
s
republic
would
put
the
brake
on
trade
and
send
everyoneoffto
reeducation
camp
maybe
vincent
panicked
whatever
the
case
we
have
a
huge
shipment
slat
to
leave
hong
kong
close
to

in

when

early
k

day
since
then
luanne
have
held
several
job
in
the
company
and
in
the
mid
to
late
ninety
be
our
lead
person
on

to
it
that

that

that
ourpaperworkwithunited

she
spoke
to
vincent
often
by
telephone
because
rayman
be
notorious
for
shipping
late
if
it
have
a
window
of
july
to
for
instance
it
always
ship
on
the
fifteenth
if
not
later
luanne
s
first
clue
that
something
be
amiss
be
that
on
this
occasion
rayman
ship
early
her
second
clue
be
an
email
from
a
chinese
manufacturer
inform
us
that
it
have
our
merchandise
ready
for
pickup
wait
a
minute
she
thought
that
stuff
should
have
be
at
mid
ocean
by
then
part
of
that
early
shipment
of
twenty
one
container
boundforvirginia
suspicious
luanne
examine
the
invoice
for
the
shipment
and
found
that
everything
be
screwy
they
say
the
container
be
packed
with
far
more
merchandise
than
would
fit
and
that
the
weight
be
out
of
kilter
with
thesupposedcargo
we
be
pay
by
letter
of
credit
when
rayman
have
good
ready
to
ship
vincent
would
present
document
to
his
bank
which
would
then
receive
payment
from
our
stateside
bank
the
letter
be
as
good
as
cash
and
irrevocable
once
approve
they
could
be
stop
only
by
court
order
in
this
case
rayman
have
be
paid
something
like
nine
hundred
thousand
dollar
for
this
early
shipment
a
second
payment
of
roughly
the
same
size
be
pending
luanne
go
to
ray
and
told
him
something
be
wrong
and
that
we
should
stop
payment
we
manage
to
cut
off
the
second
letter
of
credit
and
to
get
vincent
on
the
phone
he
plead
ignorance

two

i

we

it
off
i
told
him
what
have

and
he
go

we

as

giant
we
necessarily
become

sophisticated
in
how
we
safeguard
ourselves
against

we

the
risk
that
come
with
buying
from
people
on
the

side
of
the

but
we
could
install

that
minimize
them
take
for

the
lesson
we
learn
when
we
inadvertently

on

what
we

these

to
the
polyresin

that
command
so
much
of
our
attention
and
spending
back
in
the
ninety
but
at
the
height
of
their
popularity
in
our
store
we
have
to
be
wary
of
buying
merchandise
that
be
already

by
others
we
recognize
some
of
the
popular
line
of

such
as
precious
moment
on

and
knew
to
avoid

by
a

that

we

walk

see
something
we
like

ask
the
chinese
to
build

on

they

do

up
some

anything
to

especially
knockoff
be
a
stock
in

if
we
didn

know
well
and
the
vendor
didn

tell
us
we
might
have
the
item
churn
out
by
the
thousand
ship
it
back
home
and
not
long
after
find
a
letter
in
the

and
our
headache
be
not
confine
to
polyresin

we
be
nail
for
all
manner
of
good
i
won
t
claim
we
be
always
the
guileless
victim
we
be
in
the
business
of
parallel
marketing
anything
that
be
popular
and
by
that
i
mean
we
intentionally
sell
item
that
be
pretty
darn
close
to
stuff
available
inotherstoresforalotmoremoney
wepushed
thelimits
twentyyearsago
our
attitude
be
that
it
be
well
to
seek
forgiveness
than
ask
permission
when
we
be
caught
we
be
quick
to
make
amends
those
other
company
have
to
protect
their
brand
and
their
price
we
understood
that
and
gavethemtheirdue
but
as
you
can
imagine
all
the
legal
wrangle
grow
to
be
a
real
pain
in
the
neck
not
to
mention
a
major
expense
over
time
we
decide
we
d
be
well
off
buying
far
less
merchandise
from
sample
and
instead
go
to
china
with
our
own
product
design
these
day
we
no
longer
rely
on
copying
what
we
see
in
the
showroom
if
an
item
in
our
store
have
a
design
on
it
whether
it
s
a
plate
a
gift
bag
or
the
packaging
on
a

brand
odds
be
we
create
it
in

we

it
s

take
to
a

level
we
can
fashion
a
more
attractive
pattern
than
the
chinese
designer
or
at
least
one
that
sits
well
with
american
consumer
and
we
avoid
any

issue
it
also
enables
us
to
match

with

and
ours
have
the

popular
look

we

stamp
that
on
the

of
every
gift
bag
and
sell

such

notwithstanding
joan
and
i
still
love
go
overseas
with
the
team
we
continued
to
have
great
adventure
on
every
trip
and
as
the
new
century
approach
the
dynamic
of
negotiation
shift
to
favor
us
even
more
i
could
approach
a
vendor
about
a
plastic
cup
for
instance
and
say
i
d
like
to
buy
two
million
of
these
cup
the
vendor
might
say
very
well
that
cup
cost
sixty
five
cent
to
which
i
could
say
no
i
need
to
make
a
percent
margin
on
this
cup
so
i
can
pay
fifty
three
cent
thank

that
before

without

andi
also
knew
that
any

who

let
alone
trade
with
us
in
the

would
have
to
do
some
serious

it

doug

decide

take
a

more
chip
off

we
sell
a

and
i
have
be
comfortable
before
then
to
be
sure
but
with
this

we
reach
a
point
where
the
big
worry
we
have
about
money
be
which
worthy
cause
we
dgiveitto
we
also
begin
to
wonder
each
in

way
how
much
longer
we
could
play
the
role
we
occupy
and
if
it

to
have
someone
else
come
in
to
keep
the

doug
felt
he
d
do
well
enough
as
a
work
man
an
understatement
if
ever
there
be
one
and
that
it
might
be
time
to
take
it
easy
see
the

have
some
fun
ray
have
work
hard
for
decade
he
be
at
the

seven

most
week
and
now
face
great
pressure
related
to
our
public
status
especially
deal
with
a
board
of
director
that
ask
what
seem
silly
question
on
top
of
those
frustration
he
have
some
health
issue
that
wouldn
t
abate
unless
he
slow
down
the

who
d
bankroll

and
now
they
have
an
opportunity

for
me
i
worried
that
our
improbable
venture
might
soon
outgrow
us
we
d
achieve
success
so
far
by

as
much
as
anything
go
with

john
megrue
have
be
tell
me
for
year
that
i
d
face
some
difficult
decision
about
our
corporate
leadership
because
we
be
outrun
the
ability
of
the
team
member
who
d
be
with
us
from
the
early
day
and
who
have
risen
through
the
rank
as
we
d
grown
we
would
need
expert
in
big
corporate
system
he
say
expert
in
new
technology
we
d
need
leader
who
be
humble
enough
to
mesh
with
the
dollar
tree
culture
but
whose
business
training
give
them
the
wherewithal
to

itwas

i
couldn

bring
myself
to

over
time
i
realize
john
be
probably
right
thatwe

i
come
to
this
realization
because
i
saw
that
everything

apply
to
me
too
i
be
an
instinctive
leader
along
with
doug

i
have
create
a
vision
of
what
we

pursue
it
successfully

i

only
to

the

us
determine

network
move
carton
efficiently
from
the

to
the

to
our

but
even
so
we
have
no
system
in
place
to
manage
how
many
carton
to
send
to
each
and
thus
how
to
buy
at
the
proper
level
we
might
find
an
item
in
hong
kong
we
like
a
good
item
we
knew
would
sell
but
how
many
should
we
buy
we
use
to
work
out
those
number
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
in
our
hotel
room
we
have
so
many
store
and
figure
we
could
sell
so
many
item
per
store
so
we
should
buy
x
number
of
item
then
we
have
to
decide
where
to
send
it
how
many
to
warehouse
a
to
warehouse
b
and
so
on
who
would
get
it
and
who
wouldn
t
we
use
to
buy
merchandise
and
simply
push
it
out
to
the
store
but
that
could
land
us
in
trouble
because
when
we
be
fly
blind
and
push
merchandise
to
the
store
simply
because
we
have
it
come
into
the
country
we
could
jam
some
store
with
too
much
inventory

leave
some

our

out

too
some
would
get
swamp
with
merchandise
while
others
be
hungry
for
more
to
the
point
that
we
d
have
to
shift
store
from
one
dc
to
another
if
chesapeake

because
it

physically
close

olive

we
d
take
some
of
chesapeake

and
have
olive

supply
them
even
though
it
be
farther
away
until
the
inventory
be
back
in

it
be
much
cheaper
to
run
truck

beyond

it

when
we
crunched

it
might
be
easy
for
an
outsider
review
the
crazy
growth
of
dollar
tree
through
the
end
of
to
dismiss
it
all
as
the
product
of
undersell
the
competition
to
say
we
achieve
success
simply
because
our
product
be
so
inexpensive
but
that
s
not
the
way
i
look
at
dollar
tree
i
never
have
our
success
have
always
seem
to
me
the
result
of
try
to
do
therightthingfortherightreason
those
aren
t
just
word
i
reckon
we
could
have
bought
cheaper
less
worthy
stuff
at
a
high
margin
on
our
buying
trip
and
offer
it
for
a
dollar
and
our
customer
would
have
be
none
the
wiser
but
we
didn
t
do
that
we
strove
to
treat
our
customer
as
we
d
want
to
be
treat
and
that
meant
gettingthebest
qualitywecould
afford
we
could
have
look
after
our
own
people
poorly
could
have
paid
our
sale
associate
and
warehouse
team
the
minimum
without
benefit
and
not
bother
with
performance
bonus
and
investment
option
but
we
didn
t
do
that
we
can
t
pay
them
as
much
as
they
re
worth
to
us
because
if
we
do
we
d
have
go
bankrupt
long
ago
consider
how
high
a
regard
we
have
for
them
but
we
pay
them
decently
and
always
try
to
treat
them
fairly
we
train
our
manager
to
catch
people
do
something
right
to
praise
them
encourage
them
show
them
how
important
they
be
to
the
company
s
success
because
without
question
they
re
the
most
important
asset
we
have
we
reward
initiative
and
smart
with
advancement
into
the
management
tier
and
at
the
rate
we
ve
grown
those
opportunity
have
come
along
frequently
we
ve
always
try
to
give
our
people
a
way
to
share
in
our
success
early
on
when
we
be

to
obtain

some
of
them
make
out
very
well
when
we
sell
the
toy
company
we
try
to
deal
them
into
the

by
that

at
some

amid
this
expansion
we

a
big
retreat
in

for

not

the
business

we
be
still
strive
to
be
straight
up

by
the

just
as
we
have
try
to
be
on
our
first
toy
buying

we
still
hew
to
the
idea
that
to
be

we
first
have
to
be
good
as
we
grow

like
these
people
be
on
some
holy
mission
when
what
they
re
do
be
run
a
bunch
of
dollar
store
fair
enough
but
those

fill
an
importantniche
theyprovideaservice
let
me
offer
a
story
that
illustrates
what
i
m
say
darcy
stephan
brought
us
into
the
computer
age
at
k
k
built
our
computer
network
at
dollar

consult
with
steve
white
on
the
development
of
our
logistical
system
and
start
the
process
of
automate
our
store
but
she
didn
t
spend
a
whole
lot
of
time
in
those
store
she
be
always
saturate
with
task
atourheadquarters
sometimes
at
christmas
when
the
store
be
overwhelmed
with
customer
we
all
have
to
pitch
in
on
the
front
line
darcy
have
help
at
k
k
store
early
in
her
tenure
and
one
holiday
season
in
the
early
ninety
she
foundherselfworkingthe
floorinadollartree
until
that
night
darcy
hadn
t
much
understood
the
appeal
of
our
merchandise
now
she
be
approach
by
an
old
gentleman
who
ask
for
her
help
in

out
a

gift
for
his
wife
the
country

hehad
fivedollarstospend
it
be
a
moment
both
wonderful
and
devastate
for
her
suddenly
she
have
a
sense
of
what
the
company
be
all
about
of
how
much
its
customer
have
come
to
depend
on
it
she
help
the
man
select
a

of

and
a
vase
or
some
similar
knickknack
he
left
happy
she
end
her
shift
a
true
believer
so
sure
it
s
a
dollar
store
but
the
mission
and
value
mean
something
to
me
and
the
fact
that
they
remain
virtually
unchanged
since
we
write
them
might
not
mean
much
if
we
weren
t
a
very
different
company
in
a
great
many
respect
fromthe

none
of

be
revolutionary
it
come
as
ray
might
have
phrase
it
in
steady
measure
fashion
but
a
veteran
from
a
dozen
year
ago
would
hardly
recognize

go

i
hope
they
will
it
llbeamuchdifferentcompanyagain
inanotherdozen

why
because
in
retail
if
you
re
not
change
you
re
die
we
have
to
strive
to
stay
fresh
to
keep
surprising
our
customer
we
can
t
make
that
happen
by
embrace
the
status
quo
even
for
a

yet
i
like
to
think
that
our

statement
and

will
still
be
in

in
a

beyond

too
what
the

need
be
no
longer
my
personal
style
of
leadership
but
a
ceo
with
the
sort
of
organizational
skill
to
manage
a
corporate
giant
i

beganmyown
exit
succession
from
a
company
s
founder
to
someone
new
be
i
m
told
one
of
the
most
difficult
transition
that
can
take
place
in
business
few
transfer
of
power
happen
smoothly
the
work
force
have
a
hard
time
accept
new
leadership
in
place
of
a
bos
who
have
a
hand
in
building
the
enterprise
and
the
founder
have
a
heck
of
a
time
let
go
who
after
all
know
the
business
well
in
the
course
of
a
company
s
history
that
founder
have
do
everything
from
buying
paper
clip
and
mop
the
floor
to
devise
long
term
strategy
and
perhaps
more
importantly
he
embodies
the
vision
everyone
in
the
work
force
have
share
the
goal
toward
which
everyone
have
labor
in
theory
it
shouldn
t
be
such
a
big
deal
if
you
build
a
company
with
the
right
structure
and
with
the
best
possible
people
in
each
slot
you
should
be
able
to
swap
out
individual
executive
like
component
of
an
engine
personality
shouldn
t
count
for
nearly
as
much
as
competence
but
company
aren
t
machine
they
re
living
breathing
entity
susceptible
to
organic
stress
and
ailment
as
surely
as
you
or
me
you
can
put
two
company
of
equal
size
to
the
same
task
and
it
won
t
take
long
to
see
that
their
success
or
failure
turn
on
element
that
be
few
in
number
hard
to
measure
and
entirely
human
their
commitment
to
the
mission
their
overall
morale
their
collective
determination
a
commit
pumped
up
work
force
will
always
outperform
a
competent
but
uninspired
bunch
personality
count
and
no
one
s
personality
be
as
visible
as
influential
as
that
of
the
man
or
woman
at
the
top
that
person
be
ideally
both
a
symbolic
and
a
real
leader
in
the
company
s
culture
he
s
a
cross
between
a
car
s
hood
ornament
and
its
driver
he
give
thebusiness
a
face
he
sshorthand

and
he
have
a
tremendousroleincharting

so
i
knew
on
decide
to
hand
over
the
ceo
s
title
and
duty
to
bob
that
the
company
depend
on
me
to
handle
the
transfer
correctly
and
that
meant
succeed
at
what
might
be
my
great
challenge
as
a
dollar

executive
do
nothing
keep
my
mouth
shut
and
stay
out
of
the

fortunate

in
all
my
year
of
work
with
doug
and
ray
we
d
manage
to
hold
one
thought
high
in
our
mind
the
company
be
more
important
than
we
be
do
the
right
thing
for
the
right
reason
almost
always
meant
put
dollar
tree
first
and
subsume
our
ego
to
whatever
the
business
need
and
now
what
be
best
for
dollar

be
clear
to
me
care
about
the
company
put
it
first

hand
it
over
to
a
new
generation

the

that

take
him
with
me
on
my
presentation
to

i
want
not
only
for
bob
to
gain
the
experience
of
deal
with
new

financier
but
for

to
get

and
we
both
spoke
after
i
make
the
decision
to
retire
as
ceo
we
chose
to
announce
it
in
the
fall
of
but
to
have
it
take
effect
a
few
month
later
again
give
the
street
time
to
digest
the
news
and
to
watch
bob
in
action
i
want
our
transition
to
seem
orderly
and
inevitable
so
it
would
be
greet
with
of
course
sasser
be
take
over
rather
than
oh
my
god
the
last
founder
be
leave
what
s
goingtohappen
iwouldnotbeleavingcompletely
i
d
takethetitleof
executive
chairman
of
the
board
which
would
give
me
a
management
function
bob
would
run
the
company
but
i
d
be
there
to
work
with
him
and
the
board
to
far
ease
the
transition
so
much
of
this
plan
seem
common
sense
to
me
that
i
be
a
bit
surprised
people
make
such
a
big
deal
of
it
it
be
consider
remarkable
in
that
we
go
from
a
family
company
to
a
public
company
then
turn
the
company
over
to
a
new
regime
and
still
achieve
great
success
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
university
of
virginia
s
darden
school
do
another
case
study
on
that
succession
i
guess
i
look
at
succession
as
a
last
opportunity
to
do
something
right
we
dfounded
thecompany
institutedgreatideas
andearnedareputationfor
be
good
retailer
and
run
a
great
company
the
next
thing
to
do
be
to
figure
out
howtokeep
itgoing
so
on
january
bob
sasser
become
dollar
tree
s
ceo
i
come
into
the
office
most
day
and
have
plenty
to
do
in
my
new
role
but
by
and
large
i
stayed
out
of
the
kitchen
he
be
the
chef
and
i
left
the
cooking
to
him
i
want
him
to
succeed
want
it
desperately
and
i
figure
the
best
way
i
could
encourage
that
be
to
stay
out
of
his
way
unless
he
need
my
help
bob
sasser
left
and
i
hobnob
at
a
company
get
together
shortly
after
he
take
dollar
tree
s
rein
and
spur
growth
that
eventually
saw
it
reach
billion
in
sale
even
before
the
purchase
of
the
large
family
dollar
chain
use
by
permission
of
dollar
tree
he
didn
t
need
it
much
bob
prove
himself
the
ideal
new
leader
for
a
company
that
kept
grow
and
become
ever
more
sophisticated
in
its
corporate
system
and
logistics
at
the
end
of
his
first
year
at
the
helm
we
have
store
and
point
of
sale
scan
gear
have
be
instal
in
of
them
anastounding
achievement
just
three
year
after
wefirsttoyed
with
the
technology
we
open
two
new
distribution
center
in
in
joliet
and
in
ridgefield
washington
oh
and
we
bust
the
billion
threshold
in
sale
the
follow
year
we
bought
a
store
chain
of
discount
variety
store
base
in
the
midwest
and
southeast
and
kept
the
store
name
unchanged
deal
be
our
first
foray
into
run
store
that
do
not
hew
to
the
dollar
price
point
we
figure
we
could
use
it
as
muscle
in
some
market
against
low
end
competitor
with
similar
product
mix
namely
family
dollar
and
dollar
general
the
purchase
from
supervalu
inc
cost
millionin
cashand
millionofinventory
which
wasabargain
be
this
a
signal
that
we
intend
to
dump
the
price
point
someday
not
at
all
we
open
hundred
of
new
dollar
tree
at
the
same
time
and
they
operate
at
much
high
margin
than
our
new
deal
store
the
dollar
price
point
remain
and
remains
magical
for
us
it
s
who
we
be
but
the
deal
purchase
do
give
us
a
feel
for
run
big
broader
store
with
product
mix
we
hadn
t
experienced
since
the
early
day
at
ward
corner

retire

myself

even
when

will
for

immensely
proud

it

the

it

what
we
learn
often
the
hard
way
during
our
long
apprenticeship
in
the
toy
business
it
testifies
to
decade
of
sweat
moxie

from
a
dedicate
group
of

i

i
have
the

to
recognize
the

many

they
help

grown
beyond
any

imaginings
it
s
a
much
big
system
driven
organization
today
and
most
of
us
old

would
find
it
probably
a
little
less
fun
and
excite
than
the

of
the

dollar
tree
of
old
but
it
continue
to
grow
and
continue
to
hew
to
the

we
establishedand
live
by
i
think
that
most
of

the

be
almost

great
than
the

second
it
pay
to
have
a
mission
in

we
aim
to
surprise

delight
our

to
do
right
by
them
to
make
their

just

we
could
have
set

simply
to

and
perhaps
we
would
have
but
have
that
be
our

don

believe
we
