belief
of
goal
zero
but
safety
be
not
about
the
number
safety
be
about
the
overall
protection
of
people
it
s
about
save
life
the
consequence
of
any
injury
can
be
life
change
we
conduct
countless
number
of
goal
zero
culture
workshop
for
our
employee
and
contractor
to
help
them
internalize
the
concept
of
goal
zero
jmj
associate
work
with
us
to
develop
the
initial
workshop
and
then
our
global
safety
director
gary
jones
and
his
team
lead
the
facilitation
effort
around
the
lyondellbasell
world
these
workshop
turn
out
to
be
life
change
event
for
our
people
rather
than
specifically
define
goal
zero
we
use
a
variety
of
video
story
and
example
of
serious
incident
to
introduce
topic
one
of
the
most
effective
video
be
call
remember
charlie
it
s
the
story
of
charlie
morecraft
s
near
death
experience
in
a
refinery
explosion
he
tell
the
story
passionately
and
describes
how
take
a
shortcut
and
break
some
rule
change
his
life
forever
it
s
a
well
do
emotional
video
that
be
certain
to
get
your
attention
our
approach
in
the
workshop
be
to
facilitate
discussion
and
lead
the
people
rather
than
tell
them
what
to
do
we
d
ask
people
to
think
deeply
about
the
consequence
of
a
serious
injury
and
what
it
would
be
like
for
their
family
if
they
didn
t
make
it
home
from
work
we
use
small
group
breakout
session
for
discussion
on
why
goal
zero
behavior
be
so
important
and
what
it
meant
to
them
as
we
gather
back
together
individual
give
emotional
testimony
of
their
experience
at
time
people
cry
as
they
talk
about
the
impact
a
serious
injury
would
have
on
their
love
one
imagine
never
get
to
play
baseball
with
your
son
again
or
never
get
to
watch
your
daughter
s
dance
recital
time
and
time
again
people
say
they
thought
they
have
be
work
safely
but
now
realize
they
have
be
nonchalant
about
it
goal
zero
take
them
to
an
entirely
new
level
and
make
them
much
more
proactive
in
their
work
to
prevent
incident
and
defect
we
use
the
powerful
theme
goal
zero
begin
with
me
over
time
we
developed
a
toolbox
of
additional
workshop
and
tool
that
all
center
around
the
goal
zero
theme
coach
to
goal
zero
be
one
of
the
more
popular
one
for
help
front
line
supervisor
there
be
many
key
to
success
for
these
workshop
the
workshop
be
lead
by
our
internal
staff
and
we
engage
local
people
from
the
host
location
to
help
with
the
facilitation
especially
when
break
into
small
group
culture
varied
from
country
to
country
so
patience
be
necessary
to
give
time
for
concept
to
be
understood
and
internalize
translate
material
into
the
local
language
be
critical
before
we
left
a
site
we
want
the
local
people
to
understand
goal
zero
believe
in
goal
zero
and
own
goal
zero
people
be
smart
and
can
accept
principle
if
they
understand
why
the
principle
be
important
and
have
some
data
to
back
them
up
people
begin
to
change
their
belief
about
goal
zero
and
that
not
get
hurt
be
indeed
possible
and
expect
they
know
and
believe
they
can
achieve
goal
zero
and
expect
everyone
around
them
to
do
the
same
people
recognize
that
by
risk
incident
and
injury
they
be
put
everyone

if
each
person
accomplishes
each
task
every
day
injury
free
they
will
make
it
injury
free
the
entire
year
team
member
begin
to
understand
that
the
only
way
to
achieve
goal
zero
be
to
follow
the
rule
at
all
time
even
when
no
one
be
watch
to
do
a
good
pre

analysis
before
each

about
the

you
can
see
the
passion
in
people
as
they

and
so
do

a

everything
throughout
the
organization

begin
promote
and
explain
goal
zero
to
others
they
work
with
a
goal

attitude
because
they
want
to
not
because
they
have
to
as

always
felt
an
enormous
sense
of

when
visit
our

around
the
world
and
listen
to
the
people

success
in
a
manufacturing
organization
contractor
tend
to
perform
many
of
the
high
risk
activity
so

especially
important
for
them
our
employee
articulate
goal

to
every
contractor
as
soon
as
he

be
both
proud
to

in
a
goal

company
that
care
so
much
for
their
safety
one
of
our
success
factor
be
an
annual
conference
we
conduct
with
the
ceo
of
our
large
contractor
company
the
purpose
be
to
establish
strong
relation
at
the
top
to
align
on
expectation
and
to
share
best
practice
the
ceo
of
these
company
be
smart
individual
with
enormous
experience
we
all
improve
by
work
together
we
want
each
of
our
contractor
employee
to
work
with
the
same
goal
zero
spirit
as
our
own
employee
the
contractor
ceo
understood
that
we
would
only
work
with
the
safest
contractor
company
in
return
the
safest
company
would
secure
the
most
business
at
that
time
the
average
contractor
osha
rate
in
our
industry
be
around
the
company
that
we
select
to
do
business
with
average
an
osha
rate
of
and
what
s
even
well
these
company
maintain
an
average
rate
when
work
in
our
facility
the
same
as
our
employee
in
other
word
we
select
the
safest
contractor
company
available
and
they
perform
even
well
when
work
with
us
everyone
knew
the
expectation
of
goal
zero
and
they
deliver
a
word
of
caution
now
that
i
have
explain
the
virtue
of
a
goal
zero
approach
i
want
to
issue
a
word
of
caution
goal
zero
by
itself
be
not
a
safety
program
instead
it
s
a
platform
on
which
to
build
a
culture
of
excellence
in
safety
and
everything
else
a
very
poor
example
sometimes
see
in
company
be
to
employ
a
very
simplistic
zero
harm
safety
approach
i
ve
witness
this
tactic
in
some
contractor
organization
that
negotiate
a
safety
incentive
award
as
part
of
their
contract
for
the
work
for
each
month
that
the
employee
work
injury
free
they
receive
an
award
if
someone
get
injured
during
the
month
no
one
receives
an
award
that
month
to
make
matter
bad
if
an
employee
get
injured
he
or
she
get
single
out
for
cause
everyone
else
to
lose
their
reward
of
course
if
this
zero
harm
safety
approach
be
the
full
extent
of
a
company
s
safety
program
it
s
a
terrible
approach
this
approach
will
lead
to
all
type
of
unintended
consequence
people
will
hide
injury
not
report
near
miss
and
the
organization
will
never
learn
and
improve
if
this
approach
be
your
intention
with
goal
zero
forget
it
and
never
tell
anyone
that
you
read
my
book
the
key
to
goal
zero
be
to
set
clear
expectation
and
then
focus
on
the
positive
zero
be
very
easy
for
people
to
understand
and
becomes
a
motivate
factor
the
purpose
of
this
book
be
to
illustrate
how
to
implement
a
goal
zero
approach
in
a
constructive
manner
combine
the
power
of
strong
leadership
people
culture
system
and
asset
the
book
provide
a
foundation
on
which
to

one

i
have
participate
in

more

than
i
care
to
remember
where
the
root
cause
of
a
major

be
typically
the
result
of
not
follow
the
process
or
inattention
to
detail
all
of
these
incident
be
preventable
that
s
why
long
ago
i
realize
the
power
of
goal
zero
on
even
the
small
of
item
in
each
of
the
category
i
have
mention
earlier
leadership
people

and
asset
the
point
of
this

be
that

if
you
truly
want
your

make
the
concept
clear
for
people
establish
a

for
everything
and
you
will
stand
a
much
well
chance
of
avoid
not
only
small
incident
but
also
significantly
large
one
goal
zero
nugget
pay
attention
to
small
detail
move
forward
with
operational
excellence
let
s
turn
now
to
the
concept
of
operational
excellence
it
s
important
to
look
at
the
big
picture
and
understand
how
everything
fit
together
in
develop
a
world
class
win
organization
you
must
understand
the
model
clearly
and
be
able
to
explain
it
to
others
albert
einstein
say
if
you
can
t
explain
it
simply
then
you
don
t
understand
it
well
enough
i
personally
feel
that
a
concept
should
be
as
intuitive
as
possible
to
help
people
fully
endorse
it

call

once
say
one
of
the
great
mistake
be
to
judge
policy
and
program
by
their
intention
rather
than
their
result
you
can
t
wish
your
way

but
too
many
company
get
serious
only
after
a
serious
incident
occurs
the
answer
be
that
you
must
address
all
aspect
in
a
proactive
way
under
a
common
umbrella
of
operational
excellence
no
one
doubt
the
importance
of

make
no

for
yourself

if
you
break
it
down
into
these
understandable
category
you
be
most
likely
already
work
in
each
of
the
category
list
above
but
may
have
not
organize
the
focus
in
this
way
a

system
capture

practice
so
that
the

can
continually
improve
and
win
the
system
approach
one
of
the
reason
give
for
incident
be
people
retire
and
leave
the
workforce
the
knowledge
be
go
out
the
door
another
cause
frequently
discuss
be
people
forget
learning
year
after
an
incident
occur
these
reason
focus
on
the
loss
of

rather
than
the
lack
of
a
good
system
to
capture
those
experience
address
loss
of
institutional
knowledge
be
one
of
the
primary
reason
i
have
write
this
book
and
specifically
this
section
about
operational
excellence
management
system
a
well
function
management
system
will
prevent
this
loss
of
knowledge
most
leader
will
say
they
have
a
management
system
but
i
wonder
if
their
system
be
fully
utilized
and
effective
many
system
don
t
have
good
process
for
continually
capture
knowledge
and
information
a
good
management
system
document
all
learning
from
the
past
in
an
understandable
manner
so
the
learning
be
constantly
integrate
into
daily
work
and
be
never
forgotten
people
can
leave
but
the
knowledge
remains
you
should
never
repeat
the
same
incident
twice
no
matter
how
much
time
have
go
by
there
be
so
many
analogy
between
business
and
sport
both
have
competitor
both
be
commit
to
win
both
take
discipline
talented
people
a
game
plan
and
flawless
execution
let
s
take
football
for
example
one
of
my
favorite
football
coach
be
nick
saban
at
the
university
of
alabama
in
he
notch
his
seventh
national
championship
in
college
football
saban
be
consider
one
of
the
great
college
football
coach
of
all
time
saban
be
one
coach
that
get
it
if
you
listen
to
him
speak
he
always
talk
about
the
system
he
figure
out
and
understood
the
power
of
a
management
system
year
ago
he
have
continually
update
and
perfect
his
system
on
a
regular
basis
he
ll
tell
you
that
when
he
hire
a
new
assistant
coach
he
want
the
coach
to
come
in
and
learn
the
alabama
system
not
operate
by
his
previous
practice
saban
know
that
if
every
new
coach
come
in
and
do
thing
his
own
way
the
team
will
never
have
consistency
or
establish
excellence
this
doesn
t
mean
the
knowledge
and
process
the
new
coach
brings
be
not
value
i
m
sure
that
nick
saban
listens
to
idea
from
new
coach
and
update
his
system
as
appropriate
to
capture
new
and
well
concept
saban
s
system
include
process
for
every
aspect
of
his
operation
how
the
organization
identifies
and
access
talent
how
they
recruit
how
they
onboard
their
new
player
and
coach
include
how
to
tie
your
shoe
how
they
conduct

how
they
prepare

how
they
prepare
their

mentally
how
they

the

how
they
make
sure
every

executes
every
play
flawlessly
how
they
analyze
the
game
afterward
and
how
they
make
correction
as
need
guess
what
his
team
win
on
a
consistent
basis
if
you
watch
nick
saban
on
the
sideline
it
doesn
t
matter
if
his
team
be

be
to
perform

a

due
to

of
the

have
developed
his
plan
the
system
over
the
year
which
allows
him
to
focus
almost
entirely
on
his
player
execution
on
the
rare
occasion
that
his

loses
you
won
t
hear
him
say
that
he
need
to
figure
out
what
go
wrong
and
wonder
about
what
need
to
be
do
differently
as
you
hear
from
so
many
mediocre
coach
instead
he

talk
about
go
back
and
work

execution
of
the

saban
definitely
understands
the
value
of
a
good
management
system
now
let
s
get
back
to
the
system
for
business
you
often
hear
the
say
the
best
defense
be
a
good
offense
i
believe
this
say
directly
applies
to
business
i
would
much
rather
run
my
business
proactively
base
on
a
system
that
have
be
thoroughly
developed
through
the
year
and
keep
get
well
spend
your
time
focus
on
the
flawless
execution
of
your
management
system
especially
the
people
aspect
too
many
organization
wait
for
problem
to
occur
and
then
spend
countless
hour
investigate
and
figure
out
how
to
prevent
the
problem
from
occur
again
this
be
a
backward
and
reactive
approach
in
today

global
environment
with

tool
and
social
medium
bad
news
travel
fast
your
company
be
only
as
good
as
its
weak

a
major
incident
occur
in
a
single
location
in
the
world
can
have
devastate
consequence
and
potentially
bring
down
the
organization
we
use
to
say
when
part
of
the
skunk
stink
the
entire
skunk
stink
therefore
you
can
no
longer
afford
to
have
every
location
operate
its
facility
entirely
its
own
way
as
we
do
in
the
ancient
past
change
operating
practice
each

leadership
change
have
inherently
high
risk
increase
turmoil
and
never
lead
to
overall
company
consistency
and
operational
excellence
what
do
you
really
want
to
achieve
be
you
serious
i
ve
described
the
concept
of
goal
zero
operational
excellence
and
the
tragic
consequence
that
can
occur
from
a
significant
incident
you
must
ask
yourself
if
you
be
serious
about
take
your
organization
to
the
next
level
it
doesn
t
matter
if
you
be
the
ceo
or
an
engineer
in
an
operating
unit
what
level
of
intensity
do
you
have
for
goal
zero
and
operational
excellence
do
everyone
around
you
see
and
feel
the
intensity
and
expectation
that
you
have
inherently
everyone
agrees
and
fundamentally
understands
the
importance
of
operational
excellence
but
where
do
leadership
spend
most
of
its
time
in
my
experience
most
of
the
time
spent
in
corporate
leadership
team
and
board
of
director
meeting
be
on
financial
item
business
strategy
earnings
cost
management
customer
growth
and
merger
and
acquisition
this
allocation
change
however
after
a
major
incident
or
operational
problem
occurs
the
focus
then
change
to
a
reactive
mode
but
it
s
too
late
the
damage
have
already
be
do
plenty
of
people
monitor
the
financial
result
of
a
company
wall
street
have
a
laser
focus
on
quarterly
earnings
countless
investor
call
and
meeting
take
place
throughout
the
year
the
board
of
director
constantly
focus
on
earnings
and
the
strategy
go
forward
this
emphasis
trickle
down
through
the
ceo
the
leadership
team
and
the
entire
organization
and
finally
each
department
be
held
accountable
for
cost
management
and
earnings
growth
for
the
business
unit
financial
metric
be
very
clear
and
easy
to
track
this
financial
focus
be
all
perfectly
understandable
and
of
course
very
important
the
smartest
leader
however
understand
that
financial
result
be
lag
indicator
of
action
and
performance
the
key
be
a
focus
on
the
driver
of
performance
in
a
passionate
and
obvious
manner
every
company
have
strategy
and
plan
but
many
company
fail
in
the
execution
of
those
plan
a
manufacturing
company
will
never
achieve
excellence
in
profitability
if
there
be
mediocre
performance
in
operation
reliability
quality
and
safety
how
much
time
be
spent
in
your
organization
in
a
proactive
way
on
operational
excellence
be
you
serious
about
operational
excellence
and
do
you
demand
and
expect

constancy

the
company
an
old
chinese
proverb
be
pertinent
when
evaluate
your
approach
to
goal
zero
performance
and
operational
excellence
if
you
want
to
know
your
past

every
company
have
strategy
and
plan
but
many
company
fail
to
execute
bad
good
or
great
we
be
all
customer
in
our
personal
life
and
business
at
the
high
level
we
all
want
the
same
thing
a
good
quality
product
consistency
availability
when
i
need
it
and
at
a
reasonable
price
we
also
know
how
frustrate
it
can
be
when
we
pay
good
money
and
don
t
receive
the
expect
product
or
service
i
ve
often
told
the
story
about
how
a
restaurant
can
reside
in
one
of
three
category
bad
good
or
great
we
can
all
relate
to
this
model
whether
it
s
a
restaurant
or
any
other
type
of
establishment
if
you
dine
at
a
restaurant
and
the
food
or
service
be
bad
you
probably
won
t
go
back
the
damage
be
already
do
even
bad
you
ll
tell
our
friend
about
the
experience
the
result
be
a
ripple
effect
for
the
reputation
of
the
establishment
and
customer
never
forget
the
second
category
and
most
common
be
that
the
food
or
service
be
good
but
not
anything
special
people
don
t
normally
talk
about
these
kind
of
establishment
to
others
because
so
many
restaurant
fall
into
this
category
you
may
return
or
you
might
go
somewhere
else
the
next
time
it
really
doesn
t
matter
because
you
have
other
choice
the
final
category
be
the
great
restaurant
the
food
be
outstanding
and
consistent
every
time
the
service
be
impeccable
the
restaurant
be
clean
and
have
an
invite
atmosphere
you
and
your
family
or
friend
eagerly
look
forward
to
every
visit
the
food
and
drink
price
may
be
high
but
the
place
be
so
popular
that
you
have
to
make
reservation
way
ahead
of
time
you
brag
about
this
kind
of
restaurant
to
others
people
line
up
for
a
chance
to
dine
there
the
great
reputation
travel
far
and
wide
this
kind
of
establishment
differentiates
itself
from
the
competition
and
the
result
be
enormous
we
always
drove
hard
for
our
business
to
be
in
the
great
category
even
a
commodity
business
can
differentiate
itself
from
the
competition
by
a
constant
focus
on
product
consistency
on
time
delivery
and
mistake
free
performance
satisfied
customer
of
good
company
be
not
good
enough
because
they
might
switch
strive
to
have
loyal
customer
who
won
t
go
anywhere
else
when
your
customer
brag
about
your
product
and
service
you
be
on
your
way
to
become
great
and
it
s
relatively
easy
to
differentiate
your
company
because
most
of
the
competitor
be
good
at
best
in
other
word
achieve
greatness
through
a
systematic
approach
of
operational
excellence
and
a
consistent
goal
zero
mindset
insist
on
zero
defect
at
all
time

every
incident
as
a

rapid
transformation
in
your

successful
change
management
require
considerable
discussion
communication
and
flexibility
to
bring
the
entire
organization
along
in
the
end
you
want
your
people
to
truly
believe
in
the
path
forward
and
feel
they
have
all
be
part
of
its

it
s
a
wonderful
feel
when
your
team
be
align
on
a
common
mission
and
everyone
work
enthusiastically
towards
the
same
goal
one
of
the
most
important
factor
in
make
major
change
in
an
organization
be
to
assure
there
be
understand
alignment
and
support
of
top
leadership
to
be
most
effective
operational
excellence
need
to
be
company
wide
and
cut
across
traditional
functional
boundary
in
organization
break
down
functional
barrier
be
an
important
concept
and
difficult
to
achieve
in
many
company
that
have
strong
function
turf
battle
be
common
it
s
critical
that
leadership
at
the
top
understands
and
insists
on
a
company
wide
approach
with
each
function
work
closely
together
and
in
alignment
another
common
challenge
in
large
company
be
an
independent
focus
on
improvement
within
each
individual
function
rather
than
companywide
function
such
as
manufacturing
quality
personal
safety
process
safety
environment
reliability
and
human
resource
often
have
independent
strategy
and
plan
for
improvement
they
be
all
work
hard
but
not
necessarily
in
a
smart
and
coordinate
manner
this
independent
approach
often
include
different
terminology
and
concept
which
add
complexity
and
confuses
the
organization
a
well
approach
be
to
keep
the
focus
at
a
high
level
under
the
umbrella
of
operational
excellence
operational
excellence
provide
an
overall
corporate
approach
from
the
top
of
the
organization
which
improves
clarity
and
consistency
an
operational
excellence
approach
allows
each
function
and
location
to
work
within
an
overall
framework
to
provide
proper
attention
for
its
specific
area
of
responsibility
operational
excellence
also
eliminates
the
discussion
about
which
be
most
important
safety
reliability
quality
cost
etc
the
answer
be
that
operational
excellence
be
most
important
and
all
of
these
item
be
include
we
broke

that
it
be
a
brilliant
approach
since

brought
the
three
major
special

in

the
term
commonly

purpose
i
believe
change
elkington
s
economic
component
to
a
much
broader
governance
focus
be
another
brilliant
move
governance

more

thereby
attract
increase
attention
of
investor
esg
have
lead
to
more
consistent

be

as
a
tool
for
responsible

after
all
of
these
year
many
people
still
ask
the

question
how
do
you
define
sustainable
development
and
esg
what
do
it
mean
for
us
as
a

confusion
be
understandable
since
it
seem
like
almost
anything
can
fit
under
the
broad
umbrella
of

make
it

easy
for

never

easy
to

softer

not

this
be
why
leadership
operational

the

so
important
for

it

difficult

a

exchange
view
on

topic
but
the
ceac
do
not
vote
or
try
to
bring
consensus
on
how
dow
should
proceed
go
forward
these
guideline
allow
each
member
to
freely
express
his
or
her
opinion
since
there
be
no
decision
or
commitment
to
be
make
we
discuss
all
type
of
issue
such
as
climate
change
dioxin
human
right
and
test
of
product
i
remember
my
first
meeting
in
which
we
present
a
touchy
issue
we
be
deal
with
and
our
plan
approach
when
we
complete
the
presentation
the
first
ceac
member
to
speak
give
a
passionate
talk
on
how
wrong
we
be
and
why
she
thought
so
she
have
my
full
attention
however
the
next
speaker
take
the
opposite
view
and
say
we
be
take
exactly
the
right
approach
he
give
an
equally
energetic
talk
on
the
issue
each
of
these
ceac
member
be
extremely
eloquent
and
present
his
her
case
passionately
i
quickly
found
out
that
on
practically
every
topic
there
be
diverse
opinion
on
both
side
of
the
issue
the
value
of
these
discussion
be
to
dialogue
listen
and
learn
and
then
make
our
own
decision
on
which
way
to
proceed

ceac
discussion
be
extremely
helpful
to
me
personally
and
to
all
of
us
in
the
company
one
of
the
clear
learning
be
to
be
careful
when
someone
say
the
public
feel
one
way
or
another
about
a
topic
or
the
public
demand
or
won
t
accept
something
the
fact
be
there
be
a
diversity
of
view
by
people
that
make
up
the
public
and
you

educate
yourself
on
the
issue

make
good
sound
decision

allow
people
to
generalize
how
the

cautious
of
fall
into
the

very
poorly
by
some
leader
in
the
company
peter

to
me

think
dow
have
lose
its

with
the
way

and

he
look
back
at
me
with
a
puzzle
look

i
don
t

from
that
response
i

t
and

joked
about

me
i
m
from

i
m
here
to

to
counter
this
opinion
i
never
ask
anyone

do
anything

i
wouldn

feel
comfortable

i
look
back
my

embed
in
each
of
us
at
a
very
early
stage
in

and
reverent
as

progress
through

career
i
realize
that
robert
baden
powell
the
father
of
boy
scout
should
have
add
a
th
principle
safe
safety
do
not
happen
by
accident
but
rather
by
deliberately
think
about
it
and
be
proactive
to
prevent
injury
this
principle
be
a
terrific
one
to
instill
in
every
young
person
my
boy
scout
experience
taught
me
many
lesson
which
remain
throughout
my
life
one
be
simply
to
leave
your
campsite
cleaner
than
when
you
found
it
don
t
make
excuse
if
it
s
not
clean
when
you
show
up
just
clean
it
up
just
do
it
this
philosophy
definitely
applies
to
every
workplace
and
in
every
environment
if
something
need
to
be
do
don
t
complain
just
do
it
as
we
get
old
and
progress
through
life
we
face
many
challenge
to
our
value
it
s
not
easy
at
time
and
the
choice
we
make
have
long
last
consequence
our
friend
and
people
we
work
with
face
these
same
challenge
especially
leader
of
company
in
responsible
position
i
ll
tell
you
a
story
that
be
a
turn
point
in
my
career
i
be
bless
as
i
begin
my
career
to
have
many
superb
supervisor
and
leader
they
be
tough
challenge
and
demand
but
we
always
perform
our
work
the
right
way
we
follow
the
dow
and
legal
requirement
at
all
time
i
be
happy
and
proud
at
the
time
to
be
work
for
dow
chemical
after
many
year
of
operation
management
i
become
the
environmental
manager
for
dow
s
texas
operation
in
freeport
texas
in
at
the
time
it
be
one
of
the
large
chemical
complex
in
the
world
with
over
employee
and
operating
unit
my
predecessor
told
me
that
one
of
the
most
important
aspect
of
my
job
be
to
manage
risk
i
didn
t
realize
that
one
of
those
risk
be
legal
compliance
previously
i
only
knew
one
way
and
that
be
full
legal
compliance
well
it
didn
t
take
me
long
to
understand
what
he
be
talk
about
one
of
the
facility
be
the
magnesium
production
unit
magnesium
be
a
lightweight
metal
use
in
aircraft
and
other
application
the
plant
have
be
construct
in
six
month
during
world
war
ii
for
the
war
effort
i
quickly
learn
that
the
unit
have
many
area
of
potential
non
compliance
with
the
relatively
new
environmental
protection
agency
regulation
the
magnesium
plant
have
be
construct
long
before
any
of
these
new
regulation
be
enact
this
non
compliance
be
contrary
to
everything
i
have
be
accustom
to
at
the
time
the
texas
operation
site
be
lead
by
a
four
member
texas
operating
board
tob
after
considerable
thought
i
go
to
the
tob
that
have
place
me
in
the
job
be
careful
on
how
i
address
the
issue
i
remind
them
that
i
be
new
in
the
job
and
ask
their
advice
i
ask
them
what
should
be
my
approach
if
i
be
to
find
a
plant
with
major
legal
non
compliance
require
potentially
million
of
dollar
to
remedy
and
possibly
put
the
plant
out
of
business
to
my
pleasure
each
member
of
the
tob
adamantly
say
they
expect
full
compliance
with
the
law
no
matter
the
cost
or
consequence
they
show
strong
leadership
integrity
and
tone
at
the
top
my
predecessor
have
mistakenly
thought
that
he
be
do
good
by
manage
the
risk
of
noncompliance
this
experience
point
out
how
often
disconnect
exist
between
top
leadership
and
people
down
in
the
organization
we
begin
address
the
noncompliance
issue
head
on
result
in
the
magnesium
plant
closure
within
the
next
year
throughout
my
year
of
global
leadership
in
major
multinational
company
i
come
across
many
controversial
issue
i
always
research
each
issue
heavily
so
that
i
be
personally
comfortable
with
the
right
position
to
take
i
be
never
go
to
provide
leadership
for
any
product
or
operation
that
i
felt
would
endanger
employee
or
the
public
or
damage
the
environment
in
an
unacceptable
manner
this
stance
take
courage
perseverance
and
considerable
discussion
on
many
significant
issue
but
my
value
constancy
of
purpose
and
strong
executive
leader
above
and
around
me
always
help
to
prevail
i
rest
well
at

that
we

very
important

quality
of
be
honest

principle

credibility
the
quality
of
be
trust
and
believe
in
the
code
of
conduct
in
most
company
have
rule
prohibit
acceptance
of
gift
or
trip
from
contractor
company
and
supplier
this
requirement
be
to
help
prevent
impropriety
or
the
appearance
of
impropriety
a
couple
of
year
before
i
retire
i
receive
a
nice
ice
chest
at
my
home
from
one
of
our
very
good
service
provider
it
be
value
at
around
my
initial
thought
be
that
it
be
a
nice
gesture
and
i
could
really
put
it
to
good
use
however
i
quickly
decide
that
i
couldn
t
keep
the
ice
chest
i
have
a
good
relationship
with
the
ceo
of
the
company
and
i
contact
him
to
say
thanks
but
that
i
could
not
accept
the
ice
chest
and
would
return
it
to
him
we
met
and
as
i
be
move
the
ice
chest
to
his
vehicle
i
ask
how
many
of
these
do
you
send
out
each
year
he
reply
i
send
out
around
then
i
ask
how
many
people
return
them
he
smile
and
say
you
re
the
first
one
this
say
a
lot
about
your
integrity
i
felt
really
good
about
what
i
have
do
it
s
actually
not
difficult
if
you
think
about
it
why
risk
your
job
or
potentially
damage
your
reputation
over
a
relatively
low
cost
item
truthfulness
and
honesty
be
essential
many
people
get
themselves
into
trouble
because
they
don
t
want
to
deliver
bad
news
they
tell
little
white
lie
or
don
t
tell
the
whole
story
always
remember
that
people
get
over
bad
news
but
they
never
get
over
be
lie
to
once
you
get
a
reputation
for
not
tell
the
truth
you
will
have
a
very
difficult
time
of
rebuild
it
a
good
practice
be
to
always
look
at
a
particular
situation
from
the
other
person
s
point
of
view
what
information
would
he
she
like
to
have
and
know
about
hold
back
pertinent
information
be
often
consider
as
bad
as
lie
we
be
always
taught
to
be
honest
provide
the
bad
news
and
full
story
right
away
and
then
get
on
with
correct
the
situation
do
what
you
commit
to
do
such
a
simple
statement
that
be
often
not
follow
if
you
commit
to
a
certain
action
with
your
bos
make
it
a
high
priority
to
get
it
do
if
he
or
she
asks
you
several
time
if
the
task
have
be
do
you
be
already
in
trouble
be
competent
at
what
you
do
too
many
people
try
to
get
by
and
fake
their
way
most
people
can
see
right
through
this
charade
whatever
your
line
of
work
learn
everything
you
can
about
your
job
and
become
an
expert
i
spent
hour
in
each
of
my
manufacturing
plant
learn
every
piece
of
equipment
line
valve
and
process

i
knew

people
often
make
a
short
term
decision
that
they
later
regret
if
you
face
a
difficult
decision
don
t
just
take
the
easy
path
consider
the
impact
the
decision
will
have
on
your
reputation
and
ensure
you
will
be
comfortable
with
the
decision
how
will
you
feel
later
when
you
look
at
the
decision
in
your
rearview
mirror
finally
as
a
leader
i
always
try
to
be
as
honest
with
our
people
as
i
possibly
could
honesty
make
my
job
easy
because
i
never
have
to
think
back
about
what
i
have
told
them
the
last
time
we
be
together
sometimes
of
course
you
have
confidential
information
that
you
can
t
divulge
in
these
situation
you
simply
say
that
you
can
t
talk
about
it
at
the
current
time
but
never
lie
to
your
people
tell
the
truth
do
what
you
say
you
be
go
to
do
be
trustworthy
increase
your
competency
and
remain
genuine
all
of
these
quality
will
serve
you
well

depends
on

they

around
three
week
after
i
become
vice
president
of
eh
s
at
dow
our
ceo
schedule
a
meeting
to
approve
the
purchase
of
a
production
plant
from
another
company
typically
we
use
meeting
such
as
this
to
assure
all
detail
have
be
address
and
everyone
be
in
alignment
in
preparation
for
the
meeting
i
met
with
our
eh
s
due
diligence
team
for
an
update
on
their
due
diligence
of
the
acquisition
to
my
disappointment
the
due
diligence
team
state
that
the
plant
have
reactor
which
have
stress
corrosion
crack
stress
corrosion
crack
can
lead
to
sudden
and
unexpected
failure
at
dow
we
would
have
never
operate
equipment
in
such
a
state
to
complicate
matter
the
population
surround
the
plant
have
be
move
closer
to
the
site
over
time
the
due
diligence
team
say
they
have
communicate
this
defect
to
the
commercial
team
in
charge
of
the
acquisition
and
the
commercial
team
say
they
have
commit
money
to
replace
the
reactor
however
the
timeline
for
replacement
be
over
a
year
prior
to
the
executive
leadership
meeting
i
met
with
the
vice
president
of
the
business
who
be
in
charge
of
the
deal
in
our
discussion
i
told
him
i
couldn
t
support
the
acquisition
and
operate
the
plant
with
the
reactor
in
the
current
state
he
believe
that
add
money
into
the
budget
to
repair
the
problem
be
good
enough
he
be
extremely
furious
and
say
that
we
have
come
this
far
and
couldn
t
stop
now
despite
his
pressure
i
told
him
that
i
be
go
to
voice
my
opinion
in
the
upcoming
meeting
during
the
executive
review
meeting
i
explain
that
i
have
just
become
aware
of
the
deal
and
be
inform
about
the
stress
corrosion
crack
issue
prior
to
the
meeting
from
my
experience
i
wouldn
t
operate
the
plant
in
such
a
manner
and
have
the
risk
of
catastrophic
failure
with
potentially
serious
consequence
to
the
safety
of
our
employee
and
the
public
to
my
surprise
my
comment
be
the
first
time
the
ceo
and
the
vice
president
of
manufacturing
have
heard
about
the
issue
the
vice
president
of
the
business
say
that
we
be
get
the
plant
for
cent
on
the
dollar
i
say
that
i
wouldn
t
take
it
for
free
and
that
s
probably
why
it
be
be
sell
so
cheap
the
sell
company
obviously
understood
the
risk
in
the
end
we
stop
the
deal
and
didn
t
make
the
acquisition
follow
the
meeting
the
ceo
told
me
this
be
why
we
put
you
in
this
job
incidentally
the
plant
be
never
sell
and
be
shut
down
by
the
owner
and
dismantle
a
short
time
later
the
important
learning
from
this
experience
be

you
must
have
courage
to
speak
up
even
when
you
be
the
lone
voice
in
the
room
on
a
particular
issue
never
remain
quiet
if
it
threatens
your
integrity
these
job
be
not
a
popularity
contest

we
obviously
have
flaw
in
our
due
diligence
process
with
the
commercial
organization
drive
most
of
the
process
issue
such
as
the
stress
corrosion
crack
should
have
be
elevate
to
the
appropriate
decision
maker
much
sooner
in
the
process

scorecard
can
sometimes
drive
the
wrong
behavior
even
though
the
vice
president
of
the
business
knew
about
the
safety
concern
his
scorecard
be
to
grow
the
business
check
and
balance
in
an
organization
be
important
and
powerful
don
t
hesitate
to

adam
as
a
young
engineer
in
research
at
dow
i
be
work
with
a
team
focus
on
toluene
diisocyanate
tdi
technology
tdi
be
use
in
the
production
of
polyurethane
primarily
for
flexible
foam
application
include
bedding
furniture
and
carpet
underlay
tdi
be
also
utilized
for
coating
sealant
adhesive
and
in
transportation
application
to
make
automobile
part
lighter
this
product
lead
to
improvement
in
vehicle
fuel
efficiency
and
energy
conservation
dow
purchase
the
tdi
technology
and
have
just
commission
a
new
production
plant
my
department
be
conduct
research
on
improve
yield
of
the
reaction
of
toluene
diamine
and
phosgene
to
produce
tdi
the
reaction
technology
involve
a
large
wipe
film
mixer
that
be
a
huge
energy
user
and
a
maintenance
headache
while
we
be
conduct
pilot
plant
run
on
various
incremental
improvement
we
have
an
idea
for
a
different
approach
involve
high
pressure
liquify
phosgene
we
believe
this
new
technology
could
eliminate
the
need
for
the
wipe
film
mixer
prevent
plug
and
lead
to
much
high
yield
however
this
technology
entail
a
major
shift
from
the
exist
technology
we
conduct
numerous
technology
review
during
those
day
one
frequent
attendee
be
levi
leather
a
member
of
the
dow
board
of
director
he
be
a
much
old
gentleman
at
least
it
seem
like
that
to
me
at
the
time
that
have
retire
from
dow
as
the
executive
vice
president
of
manufacturing
levi
have
a
huge
reputation
across
the
company
as
a
tough
smart
leader
that
be
very
demand
i
present
a
summary
of
our
current
research
during
one
of
our
technology
review
and
conclude
with
future
plan
i
described
our
long
term
plan
to
evaluate
the
new
liquid
phosgene
concept
levi
become
interested
and
ask
if
i
thought
it
would
work
and
i
answer
that
i
thought
it
would
he
growl
as
usual
and
say
to
move
the
project
up
on
the
priority
list
and
work
on
it
immediately
why
wait
he
ask
levi
s
direction
be
all
it
take
for
our
top
management
to
quickly
get
on
board
with
their
support
to
make
a
long
story
short
the
new
technology
be
a
huge
success
the
wipe
film
mixer
be
eliminate
and
the
yield
increase
significantly
generate
million
of
dollar
in
increase
profit
this
new
technology
be
so
different
from
the
previous
technology
that
i
m
not
sure
we
would
have
ever
try
it
if
levi
hadn
t
push
it
through
the
point
of
this
story
be
to
be
bold
and
take
reasonable
risk
base
on
the
data
at
hand
many
breakthrough
idea
never
get
implement
because
people
be
too
conservative
and
reluctant
to
take
risk
another
lesson
be
how
much
influence
a
board
member
or
executive
leader
can
have
on
a
young
person
in
an
organization
be
bold
proactive
v
reactive
behavior
leader
and
employee
have
many
compete
priority
for
their
time
we
ve
all
heard
the
concept
of
important
and
urgent
people
may
be
well
aware
of
item
that
be
important
to
the
organization
but
the
urgent
item
commonly
get
the
most
focus
i
m
go
to
generalize
but
most
people
operate
in
either
the
proactive

pertain
to

i

begin
with

when

the

it
s

i

a
frequent
number
of

don

take
these

one
of

a

develops
it
s
not

for

to
result
in
several

operate
with
a

number
of

of

i
see
this
kind
of
reactive

on
the
highway
every
day
people
drive
too
fast
or

don

themselves
time

a
little
embarrass
ted

point
from

when

still
hear
people

a
cfo

recently
about
my

and
my
financial
report
everyone
know
he
didn
t
create
them
alone
and
it
just
doesn
t
sound
right
or
come
across
well
to
others
think
about
how
you
speak
and
give
credit
to
others
as
much
as
possible
goal
zero

enough
time
to
help
people
understand
why
something
be
important
effective
and
efficient
communication
be
imperative
because
people
be
busy
and
have
an
enormous
number
of
item
compete
for
their
attention
strike
a
balance
between
communicate
enough
and
not
overload
the
organization
don
t
overcommunicate
like
so
many
retail
organization

delete
those
immediately

team
i
want
the
communication
department
to
understand
our
action
to
drive
operational
excellence
performance
and
why
this
work
be
so
important
for
the
success
of
the
company
through
their
active
participation

provide
an
unlimited
amount
of
material
for
companywide

upward
to
your

be
as
important
as
communicate
with
the
people
in
your
organization
i
always
take
the
approach
of
want
to
make
my
bos
successful
it
be
important
for
me
to
understand
what
be
important
to
him
or
her
and
for
them
to
know
what
be
important
to
me

good
alignment
build
trust
and
clarity
on

how
everything
fit
into
the
big
picture
and
help

it
always
tell
it
like
it
be
and
don
t
sugar
coat
when
a
problem
arises
acknowledge
it

be
take
people
be
smart
and
know
when
a

honest
and
one
selfish
motive
be
if
you
be
always
honest
and
consistent
you
don

this

a
second
language
i
could
share
story
about
major
disagreement

endless
discussion
simply
because
people
have
different
interpretation
for
the

this
confusion

i
remember
a
time
management
class
in
which
the
discussion
turn
into
how
often
you
call
your
mother
on
the
telephone
many
people
say
they
have
a
hard
time
find
the
time
to
do
so
the
instructor
say
to
change
how
we
described
the
situation
he
say
if
you
haven
t
call
your
mother
for
a
long
time
tell
her
you
haven
t
call
because
everything
else
be
more
important
he
be
right
i
could
never
tell
my
mother
this
so
i
always
make
it
a
priority
to
call
her
regularly
life
balance
you
hear
a
lot
of
talk
about
work
life
balance
i
prefer
the
word
life
balance
since
work
be
such
a
big
part
of
everyone
s
life
it
s
important
to
approach
work
in
a
positive
manner
and
with
life
balance
it
s
not
just
a
job
but
rather
a
career
and
something
you
should
look
forward
to
as
part
of
your
life
have
say
that
there
be
an
essential
need
to
maintain
overall
balance
in
your
life
one
of
the
model
i
have
follow
for
many
year
be
the
seven
f
the

from
a

book

faith
family
and
friend
be
obvious
and
the
most
important
in
my
opinion
finance
include
manage
your
money
so
you
can
provide
for
your
basic
need
finance
include
the
need
to
work
since
most
of
us
weren
t
born
rich
future
focus
involves
planning
goal
set
and
constantly
check
that
you
be
on
the
right
path
and
living
your
life
as
you
want
to
fitness
include
exercise
proper
nutrition
sleep
and
your
emotional
state
and
fun
we
all
need
it
the
philosophy
be
to
not
neglect
any
of
the
seven
for
very
long
there
will
always
be
period
of
time
when
any
one
of
the
seven
dominates
work
may
dominate
for
a
while
due
to
a
special
project
or
other
consideration
family
may
dominate
at
time
for
a
number
of
reason
the
key
be
to
maintain
balance
over
the
long
term
and
make
sure
you
be
living
up
to
the
value
and
priority
you
have
for
yourself
i
always
work
very
hard
no
one
ever
challenged
my
work
ethic
i
work
many
night
and
weekend
but
i
also
use
all
of
my
vacation
each
year
i
always
found
that
spending
time
away
from
work
in
the
other
seven
f
category
actually
make
me
much
more
effective
when
back
at
work
my
terrific
wife
stephanie
help
to
maintain
the
balance
in
our
life
one
story
involves
my
son
brandon

five
year
old
and
begin
to

much
time
with

as
possible

time
when

with
considerable
problem
and
we
be

day

face
a
huge
dilemma
since
i

same
time

be
need
at
work
i
have
always
promise
myself
to

after
a
lot
of
deliberation
i
go
to
my
bos
and
explain
the
situation
i
told
him
i
have
decide
to
coach
which
would
require
me
to
be
at
practice
and
the
game
on
some
day
at
i
also
say
i
would

include
come
back
out
to

it
easy
for
me
in
the
long
run
which
in
turn
always
lead
to
more
successful
outcome
my
most
important
advice
be
be
yourself
and
develop
a
leadership
style
that
feel
natural
some
people
try
to
act
differently
as
a
leader
than
their
natural
state
off
of
the
job
this
difference
cause
stress
and
doesn

for

leadership
and
continually
improve
it
begin
with
your
key
objective
and
then
ask
important
question
such
as

how
do
we
manage
our
recruiting
process

how
do
we
achieve
diversity

i
discuss
the

and
reporting

this
statement
may
seem
obvious
tragically
terrible
incident
often
occur
simply
because
someone
hasn
t
follow
a
rule
procedure
or
paid
attention
to
detail
while
perform

not
repeat
the

mistake
of
the

develop
a
culture
in
which
individual
ask
themselves
what

what
can

the
pertinent
question
be
what

to
prevent
the

the
emphasis
be
on

as
oppose

be
essential
develop
this
expectation
from
the
begin
for
new
people
the
first
few
hour
day
and
week
for

the
most
influential
time
for
establish
an
understand

your

one
of
the
simplest
example
of
the
importance
of
i
be
someone
walk
down
the

many
company
choose
to
use
outside
resource
for
the
survey
so
that
the
company
can
benchmark
data
to
prespecified
consistent
question
the

should
request
additional
question
from
other

you
should
not
waste
the
opportunity

you
must

it

overnight
rather
transparency

take
a
considerable
amount
of

this

this
reticence
be
especially
true
in
certain
country
of

transparency
begin
with
set
clear

the

the

different
many

until
they
become

serious
i
wonder
to
myself
if
this

be
one
of
the
reason
his

be
the
subject
of
so
many
class

kept
at

too
long
until
they
become

and
out
of

another
story
on
lack

manufacturing
plant
in
china
we
receive
a
report
through
our
employee
hot
line
that
there
have
be
a
coverup
of
an
injury
at
the
plant
we
launch
an
investigation
and
unfortunately
determine
that
an
employee
have
cut
his
hand
require
suture
the
employee
s
supervisor
and
the
eh
s
manager
decide
to
hide
the
injury
and
take
the
employee
to
a
private
doctor
for
treatment
fortunately
an
honest
and
concerned
fellow
employee
report
the
incident
to
leadership
the
female
manager
of
the
plant
be
extremely
good
and
one
of
my
favorite
manager
in
china
we
work
with
her
on
the
situation
and
decide
to
terminate
the
supervisor
and
the
eh
s
manager
we
have
high
expectation
for
honesty
and
transparency
and
would
not
tolerate
such
a
deliberate
act
a
few
week
later
we
receive
another
employee
hot
line
communication
that
the
plant
manager
have
actually
be
in
on
the
incident
coverup
the
supervisor
who
have
be
terminate
have
met
with
the
plant
manager
to
discus
the
incident
and
have
secretly
record
the
conversation
this
record
provide
all
of
the
evidence
we
need
to
confirm
that
the
plant
manager
have
sadly
agree
to
the
incident
cover
up
of
course
we
let
her
go
and
lose
a
previously
very
good
plant
manager
with
high
potential
for
this
deliberate
dishonest
deed
it
be
difficult
since
the
termination
left
us
without
three
key
leader
in
a
relatively
small
plant
but
we
have
no
other
choice
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
i
make
it
a
point
to
communicate
these
dismissal
across
our
entire
company
this
incident
be
a
teachable
moment
for
all
i
talk
about
our
goal
zero
aspiration
for
eliminate
injury
but
that
we
want
to
accomplish
our
vision
the
right
way
not
by
hiding
injury
we
never
take
any
action
for
someone
experience
an
injury
unless
he
she
deliberately
violate
safety
rule
however
we
make
it
very
clear
that
we
expect
openness
and
honestly
in
reporting
of
all
incident
so
that
we
can
learn
and
failure
to
do
so
would
result
in
serious
consequence
i
can
assure
you
that
everyone
get
the
message
and
it
be
another
step
forward
in

the
culture
that
we
want
company
must
also
be
transparent
with
the
public
especially
in
local
community
where
you
operate

hold
onto
bad
news
the
bad
it
get

news
after
the
initial
shock
and
in
the
long
term

situation
and
prevent

i
always
work
to
establish
a
sense
of
urgency
among
the
people
in
our
company

to
determine
the
high
priority
item
that
will
make
the

and
then
get
after
it
when
we
decide
in
a
meeting
that
something
need
to
be
do
i
often
say
this
afternoon
would
be
a
good
time
to
start
it
s
important
to
continually
prioritize
and

the
action
that
will
make
the

for
prevent
recurrence
to
add
emphasis
we
replace
the
commonly
use
safety
moment
with
a
sense
of
urgency
moment
we
didn
t
require
it
for
all
meeting
but
only
when
there
be
a
current
topic
to
highlight
safety
moment
can
quickly
become
old
stale
and
ineffective
i
ve
see
safety
moment
turn
into
a
minute
discussion
in
an
hour
long
meeting
the
safety
topic
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
in
the
end
it
take
up
a
considerable
amount
of
time
that
could
have
be
use
to
address
other
more
serious
issue
a
sense
of
urgency
moment
can
deal
with
topic
much
broader
than
safety
it
can
pertain
to
a
current
incident
that
have
occur
elsewhere
and
how
it
relates
to
your
operation
a

build
a
sense
of
awareness
in
area
where
the
event
didn
t
occur
and
help
spread
the
word
it
stress
why
it
be
so
important
to
take
action
as
quickly
as
possible
shame
on
you
if
the
same
type
of
incident
ever
happens
in
your
area
before
you
have
take
action
base
on
a
previous
event
elsewhere
make
it
fun
the
workplace
doesn
t
have
to
be
serious
all
of
the
time
think
of
creative
way
to
loosen
up
the
organization
in
way
to
help
accelerate
your
agenda
here

be
on

than
when

sometimes
in
extreme
case
the
problem
be
serious
or
the
cause
unknown
and
these
be
the
bad
of
time
as
you
and
your
team
work
to
resolve
the
issue
and
get
the
plant
back
online

a
leader
be
to

during
such
time
shelter
the
heat
from
upper
management
pressure
and
provide
a
calm
influence
for
your
people
your
people
have
enough
pressure
already
in

with
the
urgent
issue
at
hand
they
want
to
know
that
you
have
their
back
and
will
support
them
avoid
panic
and
help
your
people
to
keep
their
head
straight
so
they
can
think
clearly
and
do
their
best
at
the
same
time
people
up
the
line
which
be
responsible
for
sale
customer
and
profitability
naturally
get
concerned
and
want
to
know
what
be
be
do
it
s
critical
to
communicate
proactively
and
regularly
to
keep
everyone
up
to
date
the
last
thing
you
need
be
unnecessary
pressure
from
above
during
time
of
trouble
as
i
move
into
high
leadership
role
my
philosophy
be
always
to
drive
progress
and
improvement
very
hard
when
time
be
good
and
to
be
as
supportive
as
possible
when
time
be
rough
i
always
remember
what
it
be
like
to
be
on
the
receive
end
i
ve
have
plenty
of
site
manager
tell
me
how
much
they
notice
and
appreciate
the
support
during
difficult
time
many
leader
sadly
take
the
opposite
approach
they
become
complacent
and
take
good
operation
for
grant
and
alternatively
become
overly
upset
when
there
be
problem
they
be
reactive
not
proactive
as
i
discuss
earlier
my
message
be
to
be
proactive
drive
operational
excellence
very
hard
and
set
high
expectation
during
good
time
be
as
supportive
as
possible
during
the
difficult
time
any
manufacturing
person
know
what
i
m
talk
about

believe
it
and
be
extremely
appreciative

to
the
company
but
this
action
by
my
supervisor
take
my
loyalty
to
a
new
level
i
remember
it
still

this
day
and

amount
of
excellent
leadership

union
represent
the
hourly
workforce

enjoy
work
in
both
type
of
organization

my
opinion
people
be
basically
the
same
and
respond
well
to
good
leadership
and
attention
of
course
we
prefer
salaried
operation
to
avoid
the
hassle
if
you
have
unreasonable
union
leadership
we
have
frequent
training
workshop
on
how
to
maintain
a
salaried
operation

of
the
principle
be
to
take

of

comment
be
very
surprising
to
all
of
us
as
we
continued
the
discussion
it
become
clearer
that
he
be
right
this
cat
may
have
be
the
high
priority
in
ralph
s
life
any
pet
owner
understands
that
feel
if
it
s
important
to
your
employee
try
to
say
yes
if
you
can
your
employee
will
be
much
appreciative
and
more
loyal
in
the
future
if
you
say
no
he
ll
be
bitter
and
remember
it
forever
and
it
will
cause
much
more
damage
in
the
long
term
than
let
him
go
home
in
the
first
place
on
the
other
hand
maintain
a
watchful
eye
on
each
of
your
employee
if
a
person
start
to
abuse
a
privilege
such
as
this
you
ll
know
he
s
play
game
and
you
should
approach
him
differently
you
can
never
allow
your
willingness
to
say
yes
get
out
of
hand
just
don
t
punish
the
entire
group
for
one
or
two
bad
actor
the
point
of
this
section
be
that
the
natural
tendency
of
many
leader
be
to
immediately
say
no
to
suggestion
however
be
careful
and
give
the
request
or
suggestion
some
thought
if
something
be
very
important
to
your
people
and
it
s
a
reasonable
request
try
to
say
yes
even
though
it
s
not
important
to
you
you
will
be
delighted
at
how
positively
people
react

a
favorite
story
of
mine
be
about
a
plant
control
board
operator
name
harry
harry
be
a
smart
guy
but
typically
do
the
minimum
and
be
never
proactive
a
supervisor
would
tell
him
to
make
a
process
change
so
he
d
do
it
and
then
sit
back
down
harry
be
see
by
others
as
a
mediocre
performer
with
little
enthusiasm
his
supervisor
robert
go
bowling
one
night
with
some
friend
as

give
it
his
total
concentration
then
he
d
roll
the
ball
down
the
lane
watch
intently
as
the
ball
struck

d
jump
for
joy
and
shout
out
robert
have
never
see
this
side
of
harry
how
could
it
be
the
same
person
how
could
harry
act
so
differently
at
work
from
the
way

i
learn
some
time
ago
be
a
grid
with
confidence
in

on
the
x
axis

confidence

the
ideal

for
a
high

team
be
to
have
high
confidence
in
both
category
if
you
have
a
strong
team
in
which
individual
each
have
self
confidence
and
confidence
in

on
the

there
be
no
limit
to
what
the
team
can
achieve
for

at

in
the
organization
there
typically
isn

individual
have
be

in
their
career
and
have
make
it
to
this
level
confidence
in

however
be
often
a
challenge
if
you
have
a
team
of
self
confident
individual
that
don
t
have
confidence
in

there
will
be
a
severe
lack
of

various
approach
to

keep
this
concept
in
mind
confidence

be
built
in
many
way
confidence
in

come
when
team
member
be
competent
honest
take
responsibility
for
their
mistake
meet
their
commitment
and
be
willing
to
step
up
and
do
whatever
be
necessary
bruce
piasecki
in
his
book
do
more
with
team
make
some
excellent
observation
piasecki
state
one
way
in
which
team
be
magical
be
that
they
allow
all
type
of
individual
to
succeed
people
who
would
not
normally
be
able
to
succeed
on
an
individual
basis
can
reap
the
benefit
of
success
and
reach
peak
they
would
not
be
able
to
climb
alone
some
team
member
may
be
planner
other
may
be
doer
and
still
others
may
be
natural
born
leader
the
planner
and
doer
be
often
people
whose
creativity
and
contribution
may
go
unnoticed
because
they
do
not
have
the
internal
spark
to
market
themselves
or
stand
out
like
the
natural
born
leader
nonetheless
the
mix
of
difference
meld
and
as
the
group
come
together
the
team
becomes
one

it
triumph
piasecki
get
it
right
understand
each

go
a
long
way
towards
building
confidence
in
self
and
confidence
in
others
friendly
competition
by
now
in
the
book
you
know
that
i
place
a
lot
of
value
on
competition
i
believe
a
good
competitive
spirit
and
a
desire
to
perform
well
and
win
be
extremely
motivate
of
course
you
can
overdo
competition
and
it
can
result
in
unintended
consequence

social
skill
and
would
be
the

stay
what
would
make
someone
want
to
leave
these
be
all
important
question
to
address
if
you
make
these
a
priority

will
be
far
ahead
in
not
only
make
your

in
your
organization

the
talent
in
your
organization
an
old
say
be
popular
about
what
it
take
to
become
a
professional
golfer
all
it
take
be
good
technique
determination
lot
of
practice
and
god
give
talent
there
isn
t
much
we
can
do
about
the
god
give
talent
we
be
born
with
so
most
of
us
will
never
become
a
professional
golfer
however
almost
everyone
have
some
type
of
skill
that
need
to
be
recognize
and
utilized
i
ve
see
many
new
leader
in
an
organization
quickly
change
almost
every
person
on
their
team
they
be
look
for
people
that
fit
their
mold
and
their
expectation
they
lose
year
of
experience
in
the
process
they
often
let
their
search
for
perfect
get
in
the
way
of
good
i
ve
see
many
of
those
same
leader
fail
and
or
take
longer
to
make
progress
i
assume
leadership
of
many
team
throughout
the
year
one
of
my
first
priority
be
learn
about
my
people
as
well
as
i
could
rather
than
make
rapid
change
i
want
to
know
the
skill
they
thought
they
be
good
at
and
how
they
brought
value
to
the
organization
i
often
found
many
of
them
have
year
of
valuable
experience
in
the
department
or
company
and
some
of
their
unique
talent
have
be
overlook
i
appreciate
the
past
contribution
they
have
make
and
the
potential
of
their
unique
value
i
clearly
understood
that
none
of
us
be
as
smart
as
all
of
us
some
individual
be
superb
leader
others
be
individual
contributor
competent
reliable
and
consistent
performer
that
constantly
deliver
on
their
commitment
some
be
outspoken
and
critical
but
i
appreciate
their
input
as
long
as
they
be
positive
in
speak
up
and
not
constantly
complain
a
few
be
exceptionally
creative
typically
a
little
different
from
the
mainstream
conservative
type
i
call
these
stallion
and
try
my
best
to
harness
their
talent
into
make
the
organization
great
i
love
people
that
be
proactive
and
self
starter
i
enjoy
say
whoa
a
lot
well
than
giddy
up
some
team
member
didn
t
live
up
to
expectation
or
be
detrimental
to
the
organization
and
i
didn
t
hesitate
to
quickly
make
a
change
each
team
i
manage
end
up
different
than
the
one
before
i
believe
that
with
this
approach
and
play
to
each
person
s
talent
we
always
come
up
with
a
diverse
high
perform
team
that
drove
rapid
transformation
all
these
people
need
in
most
case
be
good
leadership
the
bottom
line
be
not
to
overlook
the
hidden
talent
your
people
may
have
and
do
your
best
to
capture
and
utilize
these
talent
for
the
benefit
of
your
organization
recognition
and
appreciation
i
be
a
strong
believer
that
feedback
be
the
breakfast
of
champion
people
want
to
be
listen
to
trust
give
responsibility
and
thanked
for
a
good
job
everyone
enjoys
a
pat
on
the
back
or
an
occasional
thank
you
i
ve
often
told
our
leader
that
we
don
t
have
a
budget
for
give
out
praise
and
personal
recognition
it
s
so
easy
to
do
and
yet
so
underutilized
i
often
write
personal
handwritten
note
of
appreciation
when
i
saw
someone
do
something
special
on
one
occasion
early
in
my
career
we
have
an
operator
name
gary
who
have
be
a
problem
performer
just
a
year
earlier
he
be
begin
to
show
excellent
initiative
so
i
write
a
letter
complement
him
on
some
of
his
specific
contribution
and
his
value
to
the
team
during
a
visit
to
my
parent
s
home
a
month
later
my
mother
show
a
copy
of
the
letter
to
me
i
ask
how
she
have
obtain
the
letter
she
say
gary
have
be
so
proud
of
the
letter
that
he
sent
a
copy
to
his
mother
she
in
turn
be
a
proud
mother
sent
copy
to
her
two

of

town
as

mother
her
sister
knew
our
family
and
give
a
copy
to
my
mother
it
be
just
one
example
of
how
much
impact
a
simple
note
of
sincere
appreciation
can
have
on
another
occasion

be
a

puzzle
she
turn

ask
then
why
do
you
act
so
dumb
at

we
all
get
a
good
laugh
out
of
that

if
you

behavior
management
the
only
way
anything
get
accomplish
in
an
organization
be
through
the
behavior
of
people
whether
you
want
to
improve
reliability
increase
production
reduce
quality
defect
eliminate
injury
or
take
advantage
of

to
do
more
of
certain

less
of
other

or
change
their
current

therefore
one
of
the
most
important
subject
for
leader
to
understand
be
human
behavior
human
behavior
be
one
of
the
most
study
concept
of
all
time
why
do
we
do
the
thing
we
do
what
drive
us
when
do
our
behavior
become

how
much
influence
can
we
have
on
the
behavior
of
others
as
a
leader
create
the

so
people
conduct
themselves
ethically
you
want
them
to
work
the
right
way
even
when
no
one
be
watch
you
want
them
to
comply
with
the
code
of

and
follow

and
procedure
to
eliminate

in

you

that
your

make
the

many
book
have

on
the

one
outstanding
book

bring
out
the
best
in

one
of
the

model
he
describes

his
book
have
more
detail
but
i
ll
provide
my
simple
summary
the
three
primary
term
use
in
the
model
be
a
antecedent
b
behavior
c
consequence

antecedent
include
condition
before
we
act
how
we
think
the
rule
the
expectation
the
situation
we
be
in
and
our
past
personal
experience

behavior
be
the
action
we
take
do
we
perform
safe
act
follow
the
rule
and
work
with
care
or
do
we
perform
unsafe
act
break
rule
and
take
unnecessary
risk

consequence
occur
from
every
behavior
consequence
can
be
positive
or
negative
and
intend
or
unintended
the
abc
concept
be
quite
simple
and
powerful
an
antecedent
come
before
a
behavior
and
a
consequence
be
a
result
of
the
behavior
our
behavior
be
shape
by
pre
exist
condition
antecedent
and
by
the
potential
consequence
of
our
behavior
both
past
consequence
and
future
potential
consequence
consequence
of
previous
behavior
become
antecedent
for
future
behavior
an
example
of
abc

my

on

i
have
a
choice

if

i
might

however
i
also
might

even

i
might
get

these
antecedent
and

will
impact
my

make
these
be
the
type
of
situation
and
decision
we
face
every
day
in
the
above
example
the
decision
of
my

to
obey
the

not
will
result
in
possible
negative

positive

of
course
a
much

would
have
be
for
me
to

by
the

we
experience
in
your
organization
it
s
critical
to
have

that
s
the
easy
part
in
addition
to

there
also
need
to
be
a
culture
of

most
consequence
in
your

should
be

for

and
good

praise
reward
recognition
and
thank
you
positive
reinforcement
be
powerful
a
frequent
occurrence
be
when
someone
do
something
good
and
nothing
happens
you
ll
often
hear
no

when
you
notice
someone
do
something
right
effective

create

that
then
become

we
always

we

this

hopefully
not

don

remember
if
you
ignore
bad
behavior
that
s
a
positive
consequence
to
the
person
for
a
negative

he

be
more
likely
to
repeat

again
in

put

of
your
energy
into

don

hesitate
to
apply
a
negative

when
need
the
most

finally

a
couple
of
technique
we
have
found
to
be
extremely
effective
be
chalk
talk
and
competition
you
ve
all
participate
in
your
share
of
classroom

the

and
the

people
speed
through
the
course
to
finish
as
quickly
as
possible
they
check
the
box
for
the
training
but
do
they
really
learn
an
effective
technique
be
utilize
chalk
talk
for
production
plant
operator
we
put
the
emphasis
on
the
operator
to
learn
rather
than
for
us
to
teach
the
operator
have
a
training
schedule
that
include
a
weekly
chalk
talk
to
demonstrate
his
or
her
learn
the
operator
knew
he
she
need
to
learn
the
material
that
week
because
he
she
would
have
to
present
it
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
process
consist
of
the
operator
draw
a
portion
of
the
production
plant
on
the
chalkboard
and
then
describe
the
process
and
answer
question
not
only
do
this
technique
provide
the
student
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
what
he
she
have
learn
it
also
provide
coachable
moment
for
area
in
which
he
she
need
help
it
s
amaze
how
this
simple
approach
change
the
behavior
of
student
and
the
effectiveness
and
speed
at
which
they
learn
you
could
see
the
pride
and
confidence
build
as
the
person
demonstrate
his
her
newly
acquire
knowledge
we
utilized
another
successful
technique
for
more
experienced
personnel
who
attend
training
or
workshop
last
several
day
at
the
begin
of
the
session
we
divide
the
student
into
team
at
the
end
of
the
course
the
team
be
expect
to
present
an
overview
of
a

study
associate
with
the
training
material
the
presentation
be
judged
by
senior

and
the
result
be
highly
publicize
the
team
work
on
their
presentation
each
day
and
night
of
the
training
course
the
energy
level
for
learn
be
much
high
since
the
participant
knew
they
have
to
learn
and

important
participant
enjoy
the

create

for

severe
we

each
new
plant

to
clearly
understand
the
major
risk
at
his
her
new
plant
and

say
it
be
tough

well
worth
it
early
in

most
of
the
plant
manager
implement
the

process
for

direct

they

i
highly
recommend

zero

emphasize
a
person
learn
more
than
the
teacher
teach
bring
out
the
best
in
function
when
i
become
the
vice
president
of
eh
s
at
dow
i
found
that
many
people
in
the
function
refer
to
themselves
as
subject
matter
expert
and
their
job
be
to
help
the
plant
by
provide
tool
process
advice
and
track
result
all
be
very
good
people
but
i
be
surprised
they
be
not
held
accountable
for
the
result
eh
s
performance
result
and
didn
t
believe
they
have
the
accountability
i
commonly
heard
that
the
line
be
accountable
for
result
i
agree
and
the
eh
s
personnel
be
just
advisor
i
disagree
on
this
notion
my
question
to
the
team
be
what
if
our
tool
process
and
advice
be
not
good
and
don
t
contribute
to
improvement
how
will
we
measure
the
end
result
and
our
associate
accountability
a
common
understand
in
the
industry
be
that
an
operating
plant
should
not
depend
on
the
safety
organization
for
its
safety
performance
the
line
leadership
clearly
have
accountability
for
safety
not
the
function
however
many
people
in
the
function
take
this
concept
too
far
and
begin
to
act
in
an
advisory
and
consult
role
they
say
that
if
the
line
be
accountable
then
the
function
be
not
accountable
you
can
see
this
understand
in
behavior
too
many
will
do
their
job
in
their
allot
time
instead
of
a
manufacturing
behavior
of
do
whatever
it
take
regardless
of
time
to
achieve
desire
result
a
huge
difference
exists
between
these
two
behavior
base
on
my
line
leadership
experience
i
realize
a
change
be
necessary
i
want
each
of
our
functional
employee
to
have
skin
in
the
game
so
we
add
a
strong
accountability
element
for
the
function
and
each
individual
to
be
clear
each
individual
manufacturing
plant
be
clearly
accountable
for
its
operation
and
eh
s
result
but
i
say
the
function
s
scorecard
would
include
overall
eh
s
improvement
for
the
company
if
the
function
be
provide
the
proper
tool
process
and
support
for
improvement
then
the
measurable
result
need
to
show
it
we
eliminate
title
such
as
advisor
and
consultant
and
change
to
more
action
orient
title
these
change
be
a
major
shift
in
philosophy
for
the
function
in
that
they
be
be
held
accountable
for
bottom
line
eh
s
result
for
the
first
time
in
their
career
most
people
rise
to
the
challenge
the
increase
enthusiasm
in
their
behavior
be
evident
for
the
first
time
they
have
a
measurable
scorecard
that
would
show
the
result
of
their
effort
all
function
eh
s
human
resource
etc
need
to
understand
what
success
look
like
and
have
clear
accountability
for
expect
result
i
contend
that
in
addition
to
provide
the
basic
service
of
a
function
these
group
need
an
accountability
element
for
overall
result
accountability
provide
a
focus
for
drive
improvement
and
creates
a
strong
function
accountability
also
significantly
improves
morale
people
enjoy
be
held
accountable
work
hard
and
see
the
result
of
their
work
good
people
will
respond
well
if
they
have
the
right
work
environment
incentive
and
clear
expectation
support
function
need
to
maintain
a
good
balance
in
their
work
i
call
it
support
and
challenge
individual
in
function
need
to
provide
support
through
their
expertise
work
process
tool
and
advice
most
people
be
very
good
at
support
and
enjoy
help
others
however
they
must
also
have
the
courage
to
challenge
the
organization
when
necessary
their
add
accountability
for
result
provide
them
with
skin
in
the
game
and
lay
the
foundation
for
challenge
the
line
it
s
not
enough
to
give
advice
like
a
consultant
and
then
people
in
the
line
do
whatever
they
wish
function
need
to
do
more
be
strong
and
not
give
up
until
the
right
action
be
take
place
persistence
be
key
functional
people
must
create
a
level
of
discomfort
at
time
to
drive
initiative
and
the
right
behavior
of
course
this
role
take
good
human
relation
skill
but
absolutely
add
to
effectiveness
and
credibility
of
the
function
and
the
result
they
will
achieve
choose
the
right
leader
for
function
be
critically
important
do
you
want
a
staff
person
to
just
manage
the
back
office
of
a
function
or
do
you
want
a
strong
leader
to
drive
the
function
and
achieve
measurable
improvement
across
the
entire
organization
there
be
a
huge
difference
between
the
two
if
the
wrong
person
be
assign
to
lead
a
function
with
no
history
of
drive
bottom
line
result
then
don
t
expect
a
paradigm
shift
in
company
performance
a
person
with
no
proven
history
of
influence
others
and
drive
improvement
will
find
it
difficult
to
lead
a
function
that
have
to
work
through
influence
of
others
to
achieve
result
the
leader
will
do
a
good
job
of
the
basic
however
he
she
might
fall
short
in
the
skill
it
take
to
improve
company
performance
a
subject
matter
expert
doesn
t
necessarily
become
a
strong
leader
just
to
be
clear
line
management
should
always
have
primary
accountability
for
their
people
and
performance
of
their
organization
however
a
terrific
functional
leader
accepts
accountability
that
his
her
function
s
system
and
tool
be
work
well
and
the
line
be

the

all
of
you
currently

you
can

it
s
great
if
you
want
to
be
a
subject
matter
expert
in
a
particular
field
however
if
you
want
to
become
a
leader
you
must
begin
early
to
develop
leadership
skill
and
demonstrate
a
track

of
ownership
passion
and
result
work
closely
with

you
can
gain
these

in
a

of
manner
such
as
through

the
key
be
to
be

then
you
will
be
an
outstanding
candidate
for

my
career
take
a
major
shift
when
i
move
into
a
global
functional
leadership
role
in
prior
role
i
always
have
clear
line
accountability
with
an
appropriate
number
of
direct
report
and
staff
to
do
the
job
in
my
new
functional
role
with
only
a
small
group
of
direct
report
i
quickly
realize
i
have
to
operate
through
influence
of
others
to
be
successful
an
important

element

create

for

for
the

of
promote
operational

i
felt
that
if
i
create
an
excite
and
reasonable

and
plan
that
be
well
understood
our
people
would
get
on

and
execute
i
need
leadership
throughout
the
company
to
consistently
deliver
our
message
i
utilized
every
person
in
the
organization
who
could
help
us
spread
the
word
and
implement
the

to

in
the

how
could
we
fail
for

i

interested
so
they
could
keep
their

fascinate
the
point
of
this
section
be
that
no
one
can
accomplish

in

i
hear
individual

often
say
i
don

i
find
that
to

many
of

other
subject

who

be
a

shy
tend
to
wait

call
when

may
become

live
on
their

these

they
have

a

vital
for

i
ve
see
many

become
too
comfortable
in
their
job
and
develop
a
responsive
mode
go
wherever
they
be
ask
to
present
at
meeting

whenever
someone
call
on
them
i
ve
see
many
rest
on
their
laurel
from
past
contribution
i
remember
one
of
our
research
scientist
from
dow
in
my
early
year
he
be
a
crystalline
morphology
expert
i
saw
him
give
the
same
presentation
a
hundred
time
over
the
year
and
always
wonder
what
contribution
he
have
make
lately
a
professional
baseball
player
may
have
be
the
league
s
most
valuable
player
a
few
year
earlier
but
his

many
company
have
be
on
an
endless
path
of
reorganize
restructuring
and
downsize
ever
since
the
early
s
as
described
in
my
history
lesson
in
chapter
some
company
never
learn
their
lesson
during
good
time
they
lose
discipline
and
hire
too
many
people
then
when
time
get
tough
they
be
force
to
downsize
the
organization
and
implement
layoff
i
learn
early
on
to
maintain
the
headcount
of
my
team
on
the
lean
side
people
would
come
to
me
and
say
we
need
more
resource
and
i
d
tell
them
no
you
don
t
it
s
always
well
to
stay
slightly
understaffed
they
all
learn
to
appreciate
it
when
the
bad
time
come
around
and
we
didn
t
need
to
do
much
cut
of
budget
on
one
occasion
dow
announce
there
would
be
a
reduction
in
headcount
after
a
few
week
my
best
instrument
electrical
technician
come
to
talk
with
me
he
be
shake
and
say
he
be
extremely
worried
about
lose
his
job
and
couldn
t
sleep
at
night
i
told
him
danny
you
be
our
best
technician
and
you
would
be
the
last
to
lose
your
job
he
say
he
understood
but
still
couldn
t
get
over
the
fear
of
the
possibility
some
of
your
best
people
worry
the
most
on
many
other
occasion
i
saw
organization
take
month
to
begin
execute
downsize
plan
after
announcement
have
be
make
the
pending
employee

kept
hang
over
everyone
s
head
and
impact
morale
in
significant
way
for
the
first
time
some
of
the
very
best
and
loyal
people
update
resume
and
start
proactively
look
elsewhere
for
a
job
the
damage
be
incredible
don
t
underestimate
the
impact
that
downsize
can
have
on
the
people
leave
but
also
on
the
people
remain
avoid
the
need
to
downsize
in
the
first
place
however
if
downsize
must
be
do
move
as
quickly
as
possible
and
communicate
clearly
as
often
as
you
can
downsize
can
be
slow
and

the
poor
performer
many
company
and
leader
lack
the
skill
for
deal
with
poor
performer
these
leader
let
poor
performance
continue
result
in
morale
loss
with
good
perform
employee
and
much
bad
a
significant
incident
as
a
result
of
the
poor
performance
i
ve
have
my
fair
share
of
poor
performer
through
the
year
i
m
proud
that
in
most
case
i
be
successful
in
turn
their
performance
around
i
always
approach
poor
performance
as
quickly
and
as
directly
as
i
could
time
be
of
the
essence
a
poor
perform
employee
need
to
improve
or
move
on
most
leader
will
look
back
and
wish
they
have
move
faster
to
deal
with
a
poor
performer
the
big
detriment
of
a
poor
performer
be
how
much
he
she
negatively
affect
others
in
the
workplace
when
someone
be
not
perform
well
he
she
know
it
and
everyone
around
them
know
it
as
well

focus
on
the
best
interest
of
the
individual
as
well
as
the
organization
our
work
be
too
important
to
not
have
every
individual
pull
his
or
her
fair
share
and
contribute
i
always
explain
my
expectation
and
where
the
person
be
fall
short
instead
of
focus
on
the
negative
i
would
say
that
i
want
them
to
succeed
and
clearly
explain
what
have
to
be
do
to
improve
i
offer
to
help
in
any
way
i
could
it
be
always
important
to
get
agreement
and
alignment
but
that
improvement
need
to
be
make
quickly
if
the
performance
didn
t
improve
we
d
conduct
another
session
and
tighten
up
expectation
and
timeline
every
step
of
the
way
documentation
of
our
discussion
be
important
and
apply
to
both
union
and
non
union
personnel
in
many
case
no
one
have
ever
be
so
clear
and
direct
which
be
a
common
problem
with
many

very
clear
most
of
my
problem
performer
close
the
gap
and
significantly

however
in
some
case
the
person
be
a
mismatch
for
the
job
and
a
change
be
necessary
tell
an
individual
about
lose
his
or
her
job
be
never
a
pleasant
experience
but
employee
often
thanked
me
for
everything
i
do
for
them
at
least
i
knew
i
have
do
my
best
to

them

in
a
goal
zero
company
full
compliance
with
all
internal
and
external
requirement
be
an
expectation
the
phrase
be
positive
and
the
expectation
be
very
clear
as
i
mention
ensure
the
rule
be
fair
and
reasonable
and
hold
people
accountable
many
leader
like
to
use
the
word
zero
tolerance
i
personally
don
t
like
the
zero
tolerance
terminology
and
never
use
it
zero
tolerance
sound
like
a
threat
and
come
across
negative
the
phrase
typically
mean
automatic
termination
for
noncompliance
many
type
of
consequence
be
available
short
of
termination
that
be
just
as
effective
and
be
actually
more
powerful
automatic

limit
your
flexibility
leader
use
zero
tolerance
as
a
simple
way
to
deal
with
noncompliance
and
they
want
to
send
a
message
to
the
organization
many
unintended
consequence
exist
with
a
zero
tolerance
policy
one
of
the
big
be
the
potential
loss
of
a
person
with
considerable
valuable
experience
if
you
use
proper
consequence
the
right
way
short
of
termination
you
can
be
assure
the
person
will
never
repeat
the
same
behavior
again
and
will
in
fact
become
an
ambassador
to
the
organization
for
the
importance
of
do
thing
the
right
way
i
m
not
say
to
never
terminate
individual
for
poor
behavior
rather
make
sure
that
termination
be
the
right
consequence
for
the
particular
individual
and
don
t
forget
about
the
myriad
of
other
potential
consequence
you
have
the
ability
to
take
goal
zero
most
people
be
good
and
will
deliver
on
expectation
if
you
communicate
clearly
and
the
culture
of
the
company
be
one
of
goal
zero
however
a
few
individual
will
always
try
to
buck
the
system
every
person
need
to
be
held
accountable
for
follow
all
rule
and
you
must
deal
with
the
person
individually
if
he
she
doesn
t
comply
one
note
of
caution
leader
action
for
deal
with
noncompliance
need
to
be
see
as
fair
and
just
don
t
punish
an
individual
if
there
be
systemic
violation
of
rule
if
the
people
in
your
organization
lose
trust
in
leadership
they
will
not
get
on
board
with
a
goal
zero
vision
more
importantly
a
broad
culture
of
rule
break
indicates
a
leadership
and
organization
issue
it
s
a
sign
of
poor
leadership
when
an
incident
occurs
and
an
individual
be
held
accountable
for
break
a
rule
when
the
rule
be
broken
all
the
time
by
others
here
s
a
simple
example
to
illustrate
the
point
i
participate
in
hundred
of
visit
to
operating
facility
my
primary
objective
be
to
interact
with
the
people
communicate
learn
and
see
for
myself
how
the
facility
be
be
operate
i
try
my
best
to
look
for
good
practice
and
compliment
people
people
appreciate
the
recognition
and
sincere
appreciation
for
the
good
work
they
be
do
and
i
receive
considerable
positive
feedback
however
i
never
hesitate
to
address
problem
when
i
saw
them
on
one
tour
of
a
facility
our
group
go
through
a
door
with
a
sign
that
say
eye
protection
require
the
group
start
enter
the
room
anyway
without
eye
protection
i
stop
the
group
and
ask
about
the
sign
the
leader
knew
he
have
make
a
mistake
and
nervously
give
a
weak
excuse
say
we
be
just
go
in
the
room
for
a
short
time
i
actually
enjoy
these
type
of
situation
because
they
serve
as
a
coach
opportunity
i
reply
what
kind
of
example
do
it
set
for
others
when
leader
don
t
follow
the
rule
in
a
goal
zero
plant
everyone
must
follow
all
of
the
requirement
all
of
the
time
if
the
rule
isn
t
important
take
the
sign
down
it
s
that
simple
remember
the
little
thing
matter
enforce
zero
rule
break
zero
non
compliance
and
zero
defect
until
it
becomes
habit
and
culture
goal
zero
you
be
my
ambassador
in
my
early
year
i
transfer
to
many
different
operating
unit
within
dow
s
texas
operation
i
be
always
adamant
about
compliance
and
follow
the
rule
i
didn
t
want
a
single
person
to
ever
get
hurt
however
i
be
disappointed
at
time
to
find
a
loose
approach
to
compliance
in
new
group
i
join
i
often
heard
the
same
excuse
from
supervisor
for
a
particular
rule
such
as
wear
safety
goggles
in
require
area
we
just
can
t
get
the
operator
to
follow
the
rule
these
be
systemic
and
cultural
issue
that
i
need
to
address
so
i
begin
what
i
secretly
call
my
compliance
ambassador
program
i
would
begin
by
conduct
an
employee
meeting
to
discus
our
strategic
plan
in
the
meeting
i
d
make
it
crystal
clear
that
i
expect
full
compliance
with
all
rule
we
could
change
or
eliminate
a
rule
if
we
felt
it
didn
t
add
value
follow
the
meeting
i
d
send
a
note
to
everyone
with
a
clear
message
about
a
particular
rule
in
which
noncompliance
be
common
such
as
require
safety
goggle
area
the
note
be
important
to
document
the
communication
i
d
admit
that
we
have
not
be
in
good
compliance
with
safety
goggle
requirement
in
the
past
and
why
it
be
so
important
from
a
safety
point
of
view
to
follow
the
rule
at
all
time
i
d
emphasize
that
we
will
never
risk
someone
get
blind
by
an
unexpected
release
of
a
toxic
corrosive
chemical
i
d
say
from
this
moment
on
i
expect
full
compliance
with
the
safety
goggle
requirement
in
specify
area
it
be
always
important
to
personalize
the
message
and
help
people
to
understand
why
a
particular
rule
be
important
i
knew
a
single
note
wouldn
t
change
everyone
s
behavior
so
i
ask
my
supervisor
to
watch
closely
and
find
the
first
person
who
break
the
rule
note
this
be
opposite
from
my
typical
approach
of
try
to
find
people
do
something
right
due
to
old
habit
it
didn
t
take
long
before
we
d
catch
the
first
person
break
the
rule
as
an
example
i
ll
tell
you
how
i
would
handle
the
situation
with
charlie
who
be
first
to
break
the
rule
the

about

and
for

discus
it
with
the
other
operator

meeting
be
go
to
take
place
by
the
time
charlie
arrive
in
my
office
at
he

be
concerned
about
what
we
be
go
to
talk
about
and
have
his
story
all
prepared
i
consider
these
opportunity
as
teachable
moment
and
actually
look
forward
to
them
my
routine
be
fairly
typical
and
i
try
my
best
to
urge
the
person
to
do
most
of
the
talk
in
a
very
calm
manner
i
d
welcome
him
into
my
office
please
sit
down
charlie
charlie
would
sit
and
after
a
pause
i
d
start
the
conversation
you
re
one
of
our
very
good
operator
but
i
understand
you
be
in
a
safety
goggle
area
today
without
goggles
break
the
rule
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
this
violation
of
the
safety
rule
charlie
would
squirm
around
and
say
something
like
everyone
break
that
rule
all
of
the
time
he
d
make
all
kind
of
excuse
i
d
say
that
s
true
charlie
our
people
didn
t
follow
the
rule
consistently
in
the
past
that
s
why
i
held
the
employee
meeting
and
then
sent
the
note
say
that
from
now
on
we
be
change
and
everyone
must
follow
the
rule
i
be
never
go
to
allow
anyone
to
get
hurt
by
break
a
safety
rule
didn
t
you
hear
and
read
the
message
of
full
compliance
charlie
respond
yes
but
i
guess
i
just
forgot
i
d
urge
charlie
to
say
more
about
the
incident
then
i
d
say
charlie
have
you
ever
give
serious
thought
about
get
blind
by
a
toxic
chemical
spray
into
your
eye
what
would
it
be
like
to
never
see
your
child
again
he
d
think
about
it
for
a
while
and
say
i
can
t
imagine
anything
bad
then
i
d
get
more
serious
and
say
i
can
t
take
a
chance
with
this
kind
of
behavior
anymore
and
risk
that
you
might
get
blind
in
our
workplace
you
know
that
i
m
go
to
have
to
take
some
disciplinary
action
this
violation
be
so
serious
that
i
m
think
about
fire
you
for
break
the
safety
rule
of
course
this
statement
would
be
a
shock
to
charlie
and
he
d
say
please
don
t
i
ll
never
do
it
again
again
i
d
remain
silent
by
give
him
time
to
think
about
it
then
after
far
discussion
i
d
say
well
how
about
some
time
off
without
pay
we
have
to
send
a
strong
message
about
compliance
around
here
and
that
expectation
be
change
charlie
didn
t
like
that
suggestion
either
and
i
d
give
him
more
time
to
talk
of
course
by
now
charlie
be
become
very
uncomfortable
after
enough
deliberation
i
d
make
a
suggestion
charlie
what
if
we
don
t
do
any
disciplinary
action
but
you
agree
to
go
back
to
work
and
be
my
ambassador
for
full
compliance
in
our
plant
i
be
not
go
to
tolerate
non
compliance
and
we
have
to
change
our
team
s
approach
charlie
look
relieve
would
say
that
s
a
great
idea
sam
and
i
ll
do
it
i
ll
tell
everyone
thank
you
we
d
shake
hand
and
with
a
smile
i
d
say
thanks
charlie
i
m
counting
on
you
after
charlie
left
i
would
document
the
discussion
and
file
in
his
record
charlie
didn
t
receive
a
lecture
or
punishment
but
he
surely
didn
t
want
to
go
through
an
uncomfortable
discussion
like
that
again
the
interest
part
be
that
charlie
would
then
go
out
into
the
control
room
where
his
colleague
would
be
anxiously
wait
for
him
they
d
ask
what
happen
charlie
do
you
get
chewed
out
do
you
get
any
punishment
charlie
still
a
bit
shaken
and
confuse
would
answer
no
i
didn
t
get
chewed
out
or
get
any
punishment
but
i
m
never
go
to
break
any
rule
again
and
you
well
not
either
sam
be
serious
about
safety
and
compliance
i
repeat
this
process
many
time
in
my
career
step
from
one
noncompliance
item
to
another
until
we
have
the
right
culture
of
full
compliance
this
method
work
and
be
a
positive
way
to
address
problem
the
employee
appreciates
not
be
punish
and
we
accomplish
the
intend
result
there
s
something
about
the
reverse
psychology
of
a
person
be
held
accountable
and
not
be
punish
rather
than
resentful
from
receive
punishment
this
technique
give
terrific
result
and
help
build
the
culture
i
be
seek
i
always
consider
punishment
as
a
last
resort
if
all
else
fail
retirement
and
exit
employee
i
ve
always
be
a
strong
advocate
of
talk
and
listen
to
people
in
my
organization
to
find
out
what
s
go
on
people
be
willing
to
talk
but
many
people
seem
to
open
up
a
lot
more
when
they
be
leave
the
company
i
personally
enjoy
visit
with
individual
who
be
leave
not
only
be
it
an
opportunity
to
thank
them
for
their
service
but
i
could
solicit
their
thought
for
way
we
could
improve
visit
with
these
individual
be
time
consume
but
i
learn
considerable
information
which
be
especially
true
when
the
exit
person
be
several
layer
down
in
the
organization
one
example
involve
an
operator
in
one
of
my
early
manufacturing
plant
our
unit
be
locate
in
a
very
large
union
site
operator
could
bid
for
a
job
in
a
unit
base
on
their
seniority
work
a
minimum
of
two
year
and
then
bid
on
another
unit
when
i
begin
work
at
this
unit
the
problem
be
considerable
the
morale
be
terrible
and
there
be
fruit
basket
turnover
of
plant
operator
i
realize
quickly
that
i
have
to
turn
this
frequent
turnover
of
personnel
around
and
stop
the
loss
of
experience
we
work
very
hard
on
address
operator
issue
after
a
couple
of
year
of
improvement
i
be
proud
of
our
accomplishment
and
the
way
the
plant
be
operating
one
of
our
operator
give
notice
that
he
be
go
to
bid
on
another
unit
so
i
schedule
some
time
with
him
to
ask
why
he
be
leave
he
say
when
he
have
arrive
the
work
environment
be
so
bad
that
he
marked
his
calendar
to
leave
after
two
year
his
mind
be
make
up
from
the
very
begin
i
ask
for
specific
and
he
begin
to
name
his
complaint
he
talk
about
one
of
the
front
line
supervisor
and
how
disrespectful
he
be
i
say
i
agree
and
i
have
move
him
out
month
ago
he
name
item
after
item
and
it
turn
out
we
have
correct
each
one
after
a
while
he
have
a
puzzle
look
on
his
face
and
say
i
guess
everything
be
well
than
i
thought
i
didn
t
realize
how
much
thing
have
improve
and
i
think
i
ll
stay
i
need
to
go
talk
to
my
co
worker
about
this
this
conversation
open
my
eye
to
the
fact
that
people
may
not
notice
gradual
change
and
you
must
communicate
often
to
make
improvement
obvious
to
the
organization
hr
department
typically
conduct
exit
interview
but
the
data
be
often
lump
together
and
not
as
useful
as
it
could
be
nothing
be
well
than
get
information
directly
from
a
person
when
he
or
she
be
willing
to
talk
salaried
operation
union
and
work
council
i
ve
have
the
benefit
and
pleasure
of
work
in
location
of
salaried
operation
location
represent
by
a
union
and
location
with
work
council
primarily
in
europe
i
enjoy
them
all
people
be
people
and
the
same
principle
apply
everywhere
pertain
to
honesty
respect
fairness
and
communication
most
people
be
good
but
you
ll
always
find
a
few
individual
who
be
difficult
to
work
with
in
both
union
and
non
union
operation
it
s
not
the
system
but
rather
how
your
people
be
treat
that
make
the
difference
the
origin
of
union
date
back
to
the
th
century
in
europe
the
purpose
be
to
represent
worker
protect
their
common
interest
and
give
them
a
strong
voice
union
provide
a
check
and
balance
with
company
management
union
have
help
all
of
us
in
many
way
through
the
year
such
as
negotiate
wage
increase
establish
reasonable
work
hour
gain
employee
benefit
and
improve
workplace
safety
union
membership
peaked
in
the
early
s
and
have
since
be
in
steady
decline
some
individual
in
union
leadership
position
be
very
reasonable
fair
and
enjoyable
to
work
with
they
do
their
best
to
protect
the
right
of
their
worker
and
negotiate
for
increase
pay
and
benefit
others
unfortunately
don
t
look
at
the
big
picture
and
constantly
create
friction
by
make
totally
unreasonable
demand
the
company
where
i
work
figure
out
that
if
you
don
t
take
care
of
your
people
the
union
will
another
common
say
be
that
you
will
get
the
union
that
you
deserve
we
prefer
non
union
operation
over
union
representation
because
it
allow
for
more
flexibility
we
kept
our
salaried
operation
pay
and
benefit
well
than
the
union
site
yield
no
good
reason
a
site
would
vote
for
union
representation
unless
the
site
have
poor
leadership
i
m
proud
to
say
that
i
ve
never
have
a
site
vote
to
be
represent
by
a
union
as
i
say
earlier
the
people
you
work
with
make
the
difference
i
ve
work
with
some
union
leader
that
do
everything
they
can
to
protect
worker
even
those
that
blatantly
break
the
rule
and
be
very
poor
performer
on
the
other
hand
some
union
leader
be
primarily
concerned
with
fairness
for
their
worker
and
don
t
hesitate
to
address
problem
performer
directly
one
example
be
when
i
become
plant
superintendent
for
the
epichlorohydrin
production
unit
at
dow
epichlorohydrin
be
a
chemical
intermediate
use
in
downstream
product
such
as
food
product
epoxy
resin
and
plastic
one
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
union
be
the
company
union
contract
that
detail
specific
agreement
and
rule
agree
to
by
the
union
and
the
company
one
of
those
agreement
be
that
overtime
should
be
distribute
fairly
but
the
individual
unit
could
determine
how
to
accomplish
the
distribution
the
epichlorohydrin
plant
have
a
fair
system
for
distribute
overtime
if
you
be
offer
and
turn
down
an
overtime
shift
the
turn
down
would
count
the
same
as
if
you
have
accepted
it
in
addition
a
clause
provide
that
if
you
have
vacation
schedule
the
day
before
or
after
one
of
your
long
weekend
you
would
not
be
charge
for
overtime
you
turn
down
during
that
long
weekend
one
of
the
operator
dan
be
game
the
system
and
upset
his
co
worker
dan
s
behavior
have
become
a
huge
issue
in
the
unit
at
the
begin
of
each
year
dan
schedule
a
day
of
vacation
adjacent
to
each
of
his
long
weekend
as
the
year
progress
he
would
cancel
his
vacation
the
day
before
it
be
schedule
after
overtime
for
the
weekend
have
be
offer
he
have
game
the
system
so
that
he
have
his
long
weekend
off
and
wasn
t
charge
for
any
overtime
offer
naturally
dan
s
action
make
the
other
operator
furious
when
i
arrive
and
heard
about
the
problem
i
read
the
union
contract
carefully
and
saw
that
another
agreement
state
supervision
have
the
option
to
approve
or
not
approve
vacation
that
be
schedule
or
cancel
which
almost
never
happen
to
address
the
situation
i
told
dan
i
would
not
approve
any
more
of
his
vacation
cancellation
of
course
dan
be
upset
and
call
the
union
bos
who
go
by
the
name
of
the
duke
the
duke
be
a
tough
guy
and
have
a
huge
reputation
across
the
site
the
other
operator
and
i
listen
as
dan
talk
to
the
duke
on
the
telephone
and
told
him
how
unfair
i
be
be
dan
then
hand
the
telephone
to
me
and
say
the
duke
want
to
talk
to
you
the
duke
told
me
sam
this
doesn
t
sound
like
you
you
aren
t
be
very
fair
sometimes
people
change
their
plan
and
you
should
allow
them
to
cancel
their
vacation
if

and
explain
what

be
actually
do
after
hearing
it
the

agree
with
me
and

the

also
to

another
lesson
if
you
work
in
a

represent

read
every
line
of
the

the

deal
with

performer
can
be
almost
the
same
in
a
union
or
non
union
environment
if
you
do
it
the
right
way
the
main
principle
be
to
treat
people
fairly
and
to
address
problem
openly
with
the
individual
if
you
take
measurable
action
to
improve
performance
most
of
the
time
the
employee
will
improve
it
s
critical
to
document
every
step
of
the
way
by
follow
this
process
i
never
have
a
problem
terminate
an
individual
that
didn
t

he
have
many
saying

one
that
always
stuck
in
my
mind
be
people
don
t
care
what
you
know
they
want
to

this
quote
be
so
true
especially
when
you
be
deal
with
the
topic
of
safety
it
s
so
easy
to
become
obsess
with

such
as
osha

however
safety
be
not
about
the
number
it
s
about
protect

more
important
it
s
about
prevent
the
terrible
consequence
that

and
family
must
suffer
when
a
love
one
get
seriously
injured
in
our
goal
zero
workshop
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
ask
our
people
to
think
about
the
personal
aspect
of
an
injury
not
only
the
consequence
for
themselves
but
also
for
their
friend
and
family
we
talk
about
the
life
event
you
might
miss
such
as
watch
your
child
grow
play
sport
with
them
watch
dance
lesson
or
attend
their
wedding
many
of
our
people
told
us
how
these
session
change
their
life
and
their
behavior
and
how
much
they
believe
in
the
importance
of
goal
zero
intervention
when
witness
an
unsafe
act
with
others
be
a

out
for
each
other
we
all
get
in
a
hurry

take
shortcut
at
time
we
found
that
most
people
be
not
comfortable
intervene
with
others
therefore
we
provide
tip
and
guidance
on
how
to
conduct

in
a
positive
way

during

be
extremely
important
the
other
reason
for
go
to
the
scene
quickly
be
to
learn
and
see
the
situation
for
yourself
it

amaze
how

every
task
many
routine

typically
perform

consider
to
be

in

and
of

people
may

it

important
to
know
the

be
aware
of
subtle
change
in

work
with
zero

be
much
easy
say
than
do
no
one
be
perfect
and
people
make
mistake
but
you
can
implement
program
and
practice
that
significantly
reduce
the
risk
of
error
football
be
an
excellent
example
the
top
coach
understand
they
have
the
best
chance
of
win
if
every
play
be
execute
to
perfection
one
play
at
a
time
for
each
play
every
player
need
to
concentrate
on
the
signal
count
so
he
doesn
t
jump
offside
then
he
need
to
perform
his
individual
assignment
to
perfection
if
each
player
on
the
team
executes
well
the
play
have
a
good
chance
of
be
successful
business
be
the
same
you
want
each
of
your
employee
to
perform
each
task
to
perfection
one
task
at
a
time
carpenter
understand
this
concept
very
well
and
you
ll
hear
them
say
measure

cut
once
work
hard
to
develop
a
culture
of

in

daydream
be
something
we
all
do
how
many
time
have
you
go
into
another
room
to
get
something
and
when
you
get
there
you
forget
what
you
go
to
get
have
you
ever
be
get
dress
in
the
morning
and
forget
whether
you
brush
your
teeth
or
not
do
one
thing
while
think
about
something
else
can
lead
to
mistake
that
can
have
significant
consequence
especially
in
the
workplace
throughout
the
year
i
ve
come
across
many
theme
and
program
design
to
keep
people
focus
on
the
task
at
hand
here
be
a
few
example

pre
task
analysis
many
company
utilize
this
analysis
which
require
the
employee
or
work
group
to
think
through
the
job
and
make
sure
they
understand
the
risk
be
take
the
right
precaution
have
the
right
tool
and
can
do
the
job
safely
a
pre
prepared
checklist
be
often
utilized
a
downside
to
a
checklist
be
it
can
become
so
routine
that
employee
begin
to
check
the
box
without
give
it
the
thought
that
be
need
therefore
keep
it
fresh
and
rotate
process
from
time
to
time

check
signal
this
mental
process
require
every
employee
to
answer
three
question
before
each
task
what
can
go
wrong
what
precaution
do
i
need
to
take
can
i
do
the
job
safely

eye
on
path
people
should
use
this
simple
technique
when
move
from
one
location
to
another
to
avoid
trip
hazard

look
up
look
down
look
all
around
this
practice
help
employee
identify
potential
hazard
by
become
more
aware
of
the
surroundings
in
their
workplace

do
what
you
be
do
this
one
simply
reminds
people
to
concentrate
on
the
job
they
be
do
at
the
time
if
you
find
yourself
think
about
something
else
stop
take
some
time
to
process
your
other
thought
and
then
get
back
to
the
task
at
hand
focus
start
to
finish
this
mantra
help
to
reinforce
with
individual
the
need
to
focus
on
what
they
be
do
from
start
to
finish
when
do
a
task
avoid
distraction
that
can
lead
to
mistake
and
defect
intervention
this
technique
allows
individual
to
feel
free
to
give
or
receive
an
intervention
if
someone
be
perform
an
unsafe
act
or
be
not
concentrate
on
the
task
at
hand
we
all
need
to
help
each
other
all
these
approach
help
drive
incident
free
performance
keep
your
approach
fresh
since
everyone
can
become
complacent
over
time
use
frequent
example
of
bad
incident
and
result
as
reminder
of
consequence
that
can
occur
by
inattention
to
detail
these
technique
and
many
others
be
various
way
to
help
and
remind
people
to
keep
their
mind
on
what
they
be
do
inattention
to
detail
be
one
of
the
lead
cause
of
incident
avoid
unsafe
act
mother
nature
be
actually
quite
forgive
if
someone
drop
an
object
from
height
the
chance
that
you
will
be
hit
be
quite
low
since
the
space
surround
you
be
much
large
than
your
body
odds
be
good
that
you
will
not
be
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
flammable
material
typically
have
narrow
flammability
range
if
the
fuel
oxygen
ratio
be
too
high
or
too
low
the
material
won
t
ignite
i
can
remember
time
when
we
have
accidental
hydrocarbon
release
that
didn
t
ignite
for
which
i
be
always
extremely
thankful
therefore
the
chance
of
a
near
miss
be
much
great
than
an
injury
the
difference
between
a
near
miss
a
minor
incident
and
a
fatality
be
often
base
on
luck
i
don
t
know
about
you
but
i
don
t
want
to
rely
on
luck
to
remain
safe
be
sure
to
investigate
high
potential
near
miss
the
same
as
you
would
if
a
tragic
result
occur
in
a
goal
zero
culture
we
rely
on
personal
behavior
not
luck
to
assure
our
safety
avoid
unsafe
act
be
one
of
the
basic
and
easy
behavior
of
goal
zero
eliminate
unsafe
act
be
one
of
the
best
way
to
reduce
your
chance
of
injury
here
s
a
simple
example
to
illustrate
my
point
if
i
stand
on
a
chair
or
table
to
reach
a
light
fixture
i
have
already
perform
an
unsafe
act
chance
be
i
will
probably
finish
the
task
without
incident
however
there
s
a
chance
i
might
fall
off
of
the
table
if
i
fall
i
might
get
lucky
and
not
get
hurt
however
i
might
get
bruise
break
an
arm
or
even
receive
a
head
injury
and
die
the
point
be
i
should
have
do
the
job
safely
in
the
first
place
by
take
the
time
to
get
a
ladder
instead
of
stand
on
the
chair
or
the
table
the
concept
be
simple
zero
unsafe
act
by
all
people
at
all
time
even
for
small
job
watch
out
for
each
other
and
intervene
as
need
avoid
unsafe
act
and
unnecessary
risk
be
important
on
and
off
the
job
injury
rate
be
much
much
high
off
the
job
than
they
be
at
work
we
instill
in
our
people
to
live
the
goal
zero
culture
at
home
like
they
do
at
work
discus
the
concept
with
your
friend
and
family
take
the
extra
time
to
conduct
home
activity
safely
such
as
work
with
electricity
make
a
repair
at
height
use
knife
or
lift
heavy
object
remember
goal
zero
might
make
the
difference
in
help
a
friend
or
family
member
prevent
a
very
serious
injury
we
often
say
we
want
you
to
go
home
safely
each
day
and
we
also
want
you
to
return
to
work
the
same
way
alarm
management
i
learn
about
the
importance
of
alarm
management
in
process
control
system
during
my
first
manufacturing
assignment
at
the
allyl
chloride
unit
allyl
chloride
be
a
chemical
intermediate
use
in
the
production
of
pharmaceutical
plastic
pesticide
epoxy
glue
and
numerous
food
product
when
i
arrive
the
alarm
panel
in
the
control
room
have
about
active
alarm
while
the
plant
be
actually
run
normally
to
say
the
least
the
discipline
of
alarm
management
in
the
unit
be
atrocious
the
third
week
that
i
be
work
in
the
plant
a
tank
of
highly
flammable
allyl
chloride
overflow
and
fill
the
surround
dike
area
the
high
level
alarm
wasn
t
work
and
have
be
active
for
week
fortunately
the
material
never
ignite
and
the
spill
be
clean
up
but
i
never
forgot
the
incident
and
the
importance
of
alarm
management
alarm
management
become
a
high
priority
for
me
and
the
lesson
remain
throughout
my
career
alarm
management
take
diligence
and
special
attention
at
all
time
i
surely
hope
that
no
plant
exists
today
with
that
dismal
level
of
active
alarm
in
a
goal
zero
environment
the
objective
be
to
operate
your
plant
with
zero
active
alarm
everyone
play
a
role
in
achieve
this
objective
the

the

make
sure
that
every
alarm
be
important
and
require
action
and
finally

be
important
a
few
key
metric
to
use
regularly

number
of

it
s
easy
for
programmer
to
add
all
type
of

but
you
don
t
want
an
operator
to
get

with
alarm
during
time
of
trouble
plant
operational

available
to

with
this
important
work
when
you
enter
a

room
the
number
of

be
a
good
quick
indicator
of
how
well

be
worthy
of
recognition
and
appreciation
to
the

when

for
many
year
a

be
terrific
but
the
side
effect
be
that
people
can
become
complacent
and
drop
their
guard
through
the
year
i
saw
many
time
how
a

another
useful

occur
outside

we
believe
that
no

should
go

be
use
as
a
learn

extremely
helpful
concept
we
developed

this
program
through
the

conduct
it
annually

over
time
the
topic
expand
to
health
security
environmental
protection

other
pertinent
area
but
we
kept
the
name
consistent
so
people
always
knew
what
to
expect
we
want
to
conduct
a
day
so
powerful
and
impactful
that
every
participant
would
leave
work
at
the

of
the

the
power
be
in

about

about

it
s
important
to
align
on
the
concept
of
a

some
consider
a
management
system
as
an
operating
model
my
simple
definition
be
that
it
be
an
organize

structure
for

how
we
do
thing
around
here
a

to

for
people
in

when
you

of

how
would
you
describe
the
perfect
management
system
a
few
of
the
key
word
that
come
to
my
mind
be
simplicity
crisp
intuitive
logical
fit
for
purpose
helpful
user
friendly
and
up
to
date
start
with
the
end
in
mind
and
develop
your
system
to
fit
the
user
s
need
in
this
chapter
i
ll
describe
various
work
process
and
method
we
found
to
be
helpful
in
building
a
world
class
management
system
i
ll
share
many
tip
to
assure
the
element
of
the
management
system
be
effective
and
meet
the
need
of
the
organization
in
addition
i
ll
highlight
some
of
the
work
process
that
be
particularly
useful
at
improve
performance
such
as
self
assessment
audit
investigation
the
why
review
learn
from
experience
and
high
potential
incident
a
good
management
system
be
so
important
for
any
organization
but
why
do
so
many
get
it
wrong
it
s
no
one
s
fault
document
be
typically
write
by
many
different
author
through
the
year
with
a
lack
of
consistent
format
or
style
the
result
be
a
system
that
have
morph
over
time
without
an
overall
structure
or
organization
of
documentation
many
company
experience
a
series
of
problem
or
a
major
incident
and
you
ll
hear
leadership
say
we
need
to
get
back
to
the
basic
i
ve
heard
this
phrase
many
time
through
the
year
and
i
ll
bet
you
have
too
why
do
we
have
to
keep
learn
this
same
lesson
over
and
over
you
can
be
proactive
by
create
an
effective
management
system
that
becomes
the
cornerstone
of
your
company
s
operating
culture
once
you
have
an
effective
system
and
execute
with
a
goal
zero
mentality
you
ll
never
have
to
get
back
to
the
basic
again
the
key
to
the
success
of
your
management
system
be
to
create
document
that
people
in
the
organization
want
to
use
rather
than
be
force
to
use
user
want
to
know
why
the
document
be
important
see
the
value
find
information
they
need
quickly
and
then
get
back
to
work
the
management
system
becomes
an
enable
tool
that
be
helpful
to
them
make
the
system
and
sub
process
intuitive
people
shouldn
t
need
any
special
training
if
you
develop
your
document
by
work
back
from
what
the
user
actually
need
your
employee
will
trust
the
system
if
the
tool
process
and
information
help
them
to
work
smarter
finally
the
next
bad
thing
to
not
have
a
management
system
be
have
one
that
s
not
maintain
and
be
out
of
date
unfortunately
this
scenario
if
very
common
in
many
organization
due
to
no
one
be
assign
to
maintain
the
system
and
the
lack
of
a
process
for
capture
and
organize
learning
your
management
system
will
be
continually
update
if
you
follow

progress
through
each
company
in
my
career
i
increasingly
understood
the
power
of
standardization
and
simplicity
we
work
to
reduce
our
number
of
requirement
improve
clarity
of
each
requirement
and
increase
the
focus
on
full
compliance
to
provide
some
example
and
perhaps
some
similar
to
your
current
situation
i
ll
describe
a
few
of
my
experience
at
my
summer
job
with
exxon
in
i
be
work
at
the
huge
gas
processing
plant
near
kingsville

a
series
of
company
wide
operating

for

the
manual
be
write
in
a
practical
manner
and
easy
to
understand
every
gas

in

rely
on
the
knowledge
and
information
in
these
manual

and
be
well
know
across
the
industry
i
m
confident
that
oems
be
one
of
the
primary
enablers
of
exxonmobil
s
long
term
operational
success
at
dow
chemical
the
company
have
a
long
history
of
a
good
management
system
it
be

odms
in
addition
we
have
a
concept
of
global
expertise
center
consist
of
subject
matter
expert
accountable
for
the
rule
and
process
in
their
particular
area
these
expertise
center
be
charge
with
collect
and
communicate
best
practice
across
the
organization
and
be
extremely
effective
when
i
become
vice
president
of
eh
s
at
dow
i
begin
to
understand
how
some
of
our
onerous
global
standard
and
requirement
make
compliance
difficult
and
in
fact
create
problem
we
soon
begin
work
to
improve
the
clarity
and
understand
of
the
requirement
in
our
management
system
when
i
arrive
at
shell
in
i
found
that
the
company
governance
structure
be
quite
different
royal
dutch
shell
be
a
joint
venture
with
numerous
subsidiary
and
the
organization
be
manage
by
a
committee
of
manage
director
the
legal
guidance
be
that
the
parent
organization
could
not
dictate
requirement
for
the
independent
operating
subsidiary
each
of
the
operating
company
have
full
autonomy
quite
the
opposite
from
my
experience
at
exxon
and
dow
the
lack
of
a
standardize
approach
and
consistency
across
the
organization
result
in
significant
problem
in
a
year
before
i
join
shell
the
company
have
experienced
a
major
setback
when
the
security
and
exchange
commission
sec
found
that
the
company
have
be
accounting
for
oil
and
gas
reserve
differently
in
various
country
shell
have
to
significantly
restate
its
reserve
result
in
a
reduction
the
company
stock
take
a
major
hit
and
the
termination
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
manage
director
and
executive
vice
president
of
upstream
there
be
significant
value
destruction
the
sec
determine
that
shell
could
no
longer
operate
with
such
global
inconsistency
and
non
compliance
with
the
rule

and
we
waste
no
time
move
forward
and
drive
standardization
across
the
company
one
of
the
first
example
be
with
motor
vehicle
accident
which
have
be
a
major
cause
of

and
other

everything
at

be
huge
i
commission
a
small
team
to
develop
a
safe
drive
standard
the
first
draft
the
team
present
to
me
be
page
however
i
want
a
much
shorter
document
one
that
every
driver
could
read
and
remember
i
sent
the
team
back
to
tighten
up
the
document
one
of
the
team
member
say
sam
i
think
i
ve
get
it
you
want
the
commandment
not
the
bible
i
chuckle
and
say
that
s
right
you
have
it
the
final
document
be
only
a
handful
of
page
it
be
a
simple
document
contain
only
the
most
important
requirement
that
every
driver
could
easily
understand
and
follow
this
new
safe
drive
standard
be
the
begin
of
our
simplification
process
for
requirement
at
shell
by
the
time
i
be
recruit
to
lyondellbasell
in
i
have
reach
full
stride
in
my
approach
to
operational
excellence
lyondellbasell
have
be
create
in
early
when
basell
a
private
dutch
company
purchase
lyondell
a
publicly
trade
us
company
this
transaction
occur
just
prior
to
the
economic
crisis
of
and
the
merger
quickly
fail
the
company
declare
bankruptcy
in
early
the
two
company
have
never
fully
integrate
and
very
little
consistency
in
the
management
system
and
associate
process
exist
legacy
lyondell
have
a
complex
set
of
overbear
document
with
many
requirement
legacy
basell
have
a
handful
of
optional
guideline
the
performance
result
be
not
up
to
expectation
a
significant
process
safety
incident
be
occur
every
other
week
in
which
the
primary
cause
be
either
non
compliance
or
not
follow
a
well
know
standard
in
another
part
of
the
company
i
knew
that
to
truly
achieve
progress
in
overall
performance
it
would
take
a
concert
multi
functional
approach
to
simplify
the
system
develop
standard
implement
work
process
eliminate
variation
and
drive
performance
improvement
in
addition
by
drive
a
goal
zero
culture
lead
with
safety
i
knew
we
would
achieve
benefit
in
reliability
quality
cost
control
and
many
other
area
one
of
my
first
action
be
to
form
an
operational
excellence
leadership
team
oelt
consist
of
the
head
of
manufacturing
human
resource
legal
business
and
myself
i
lead
the
team
and
we
have
the
full
and
complete
support
from
the
ceo
we
want
to
break
down
the
barrier
between
function
make
sure
we
have
agreement
at
the
high
level
for
any
new
standard
rule
and
process
we
developed
human
resource
representation
be
critical
at
the
table
since
so
much
of
our
success
be
base
on
the
performance
of
our
people
business
representation
on
the
team
be
vital
because
a
cost
be
often
associate
with
any
new
requirement
and
it
be
important
to
have
their
support
from
the
very
begin
as
a
member
of
the
oelt
i
personally
review
and
edit
every
line
of
every
revise
standard
to
make
sure
it
be
fit
for
purpose
i
use
my
year
of
plant
management
experience
and
always
ask
the
question
would
i
be
comfortable
with
this
requirement
if
i
be
a
plant
manager
as
we
begin
to
develop
our
management
system
we
first
create
a
list
of
operational
excellence
expectation
to
guide
the
organization
then
we
developed
an
entirely
new
set
of
global
standard
initiate
new
work
process
and
begin
to
empower
the
various
functional
group
we
create
a
system
in
which
the
mandatory
requirement
be
succinct
and
easy
to
understand
all
of
this
effort
lead
to
the
creation
of
our
management
system
which
we
call
technology
and
knowledge
management
tkm
we
create
a
series
of
excellence

for
each
major
category
of

once
we
establish

we
be
able
to
primarily

these

much
more

any

with

the

i
believe
everyone
would
rather
proactively

than
investigate
a

ensure
that

occur
which
be
the
good
part
as
the

however
the
danger
lie
in
people
relax

become
complacent
we
all
know
that

continue
to

nothing

many
company
encourage
their

to
report

near

reporting
help
keep
employee
awareness
up
at
all
time
the
problem
with
the
near

category
be
that
the
definition
of
a
near

be
not
typically
well

result
in
a
wide
variation
of

across
the
organization
if
a

they
don
t
generate
a
sense

receive
the

they
may
deserve
i
highly
recommend
a
high
potential
incident
hpi
reporting
requirement
institute
an
hpi
program
be
extremely
effective
since
it
creates
an
important
incident
category
between
an
actual
reportable
incident
with
consequence
and
a
loosely
define

category
be
a

subset
of

the

a

main

the

reason

for

when

a
management
system
be
issue
new
and
revise
document
be
typically
issue
twice
a
year
so
the
department
can
plan
accordingly
the
responsibility
of
the
facility
be
to
perform
a
gap
assessment
and

step
to
the
audit
process
after
an
audit
of
a
unit
be
complete
and
significant
non
compliance
item
be
found
we
d
conduct
a
follow
up
meeting
call
the
why
review
the
purpose
be
to
learn
and
improve
we
didn
t
dwell
on
what
the
finding
from
the
audit
be
rather
we
focus
on
why
the
non

item
exist
the
explanation
typically
result
in
a
system
problem
or
people
performance
include
leadership
issue
the
participant
in
the
meeting
include
the
plant
manager
and
anyone
he
or
she
want
to
bring
from
their
team
the
plant
manager
s
bos
the
head
of
operational
excellence
and
myself
sometimes
we
determine
a
requirement
in
a
global
standard
wasn
t
clear
and
need
to
be
update
or
eliminate
entirely
if
deem
a
low
priority
other
time
the
conclusion
be
that
the
plant
didn
t
have
a
sufficient
process
for
assure
compliance
in
a
particular
area
at
time
a
non
compliance
be
due
to
an
individual
that
simply
wasn
t
perform
his
her
assign
task
and
need
to
be
dealt
with
individually
and
finally
the
non
compliance
be
sometimes
a
plant
leadership
issue
i
e
allow
a
culture
of
non
compliance
to
exist
regardless
of
the
cause
these
session
always
provide
a
terrific
learn
experience
and
a
coachable
moment
for
leadership
these
review
be
an
opportunity
to
reinforce
how
serious
we
be
about
goal
zero
compliance
the
session
be
not
intend
to
be
negative
towards
plant
leadership
although
i
m
sure
none
of
them
look
forward
to
the
session
instead
the
session
serve
the
purpose
and
allow
the
plant
manager
to
do
some
self
reflection
on
their
leadership
behavior
and
how
they
could
work
well
with
their
team
to
deliver
desire
result
change
management
building
a
new
culture
of
goal
zero
and
operational
excellence
require
continuous
focus
and
constancy
of
purpose
a
change
management
process
should
be
follow
and
many
process
be
available
here
be
the
step
i
like
to
follow
for
institute
effective
and
last

develop
a
compelling
case
for

and
vision

create

sustain
the
change
leadership
in
organization
often
spends
considerable
time
develop
and
planning
change
initiative
however
by
the
time
a
program
get
roll
out
to
the
organization
leadership
have
already
move
on
to
the
next
priority
area
to
be
successful
leadership
need
to
remain
intimately
involve
during
step
of
the
process
just
as
it
take
leadership
a
while
to
fully
understand
and
get
behind
the
new
concept
it
will
take
the
same
amount
of
time
for
the
people
across
your
organization
time
of
change
be
an
excellent
time
for
leader
to
lead
dedicate
time
to
coach
talk
and
listen
to
their
people
the
second
area
of
caution
be
to
not
underestimate
the
time
and
effort
it
take
to
truly
impact
culture
change
stay
the
course
and
be
consistent
in
your
message
at
all
time
goal
zero
be
a
mindset
and
once
engrained
in
people
s
mind
it
won
t
ever
go
away
don
t
forget
to
communicate
frequently
during
every
step
of
the
change
process
to
institute
the
permanent
change
initiative
and
action
item
overload
every
initiative
have
good
intention
but
the
organization
have
limited
capacity
initiative
overload
can
create
too
much
distraction
from
the
daily
pursuit
of
excellence
make
sure
you
have
a
robust
prioritization
process
to
help
manage
the
load
someone
must
have
the
power
to
say
stop
and
draw
the
line
on
initiative
the
same
principle
applies
for
action
item
action
item
be
assign
from
meeting
investigation
audit
and
many
other
initiative
action
item
be
essential
to
correct
problem
or
make
improvement
in
your
work
but
remember
each
action
item
creates
work
for
someone
people
have
limited
time
and
every
action
item
will
take
the
place
of
some
other
work
that
be
need
my
advice
be
to
use
strict
prioritization
for
action
item
the
same
as
for
initiative
it
s
easy
to
proceed
through
a
meeting
or
incident
investigation
and
create
action
item
along
the
way
however
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
or
follow
the
meeting
someone
need
to
review
the
action
item
in
context
with
everything
else
on
people
s
plate
and
cull
out
the
one
with
low
priority
make
sure
people
be
always
work
on
the
high
value
item
that
will
deliver
the
most
positive
impact
as
mention
before
every
action
item
that
get
assign
in
a
goal
zero
culture
must
be
perform
by
the
assign
due
date
and
tracked
the
process
should
allow
for
extend
the
date
base
on
valid
reason
but
these
extension
should
be
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
deadline
extension
should
be
document
and
monitor
with
this
process
you
should
always
have
zero
overdue
corrective
action
overdue
corrective

create
legal
liability
not
to
mention
how
terrible
it
would
be
if
someone

unit
across

we
achieve
operational
excellence
through
a
leadership
people
culture
system
and
asset
approach
it
s
actually
pretty
basic
you
must
maintain
your
asset
in
good
shape
before
you
can
even
think
about

every

it
s
vital
that

as

the

way
in
my
allyl

example
above
we
have
to
overspend
our
maintenance
budget
for
a
while
to
get
the

course
obtain

require
considerable
discussion
with

data
top
management
may
not
like
it
but
they
be
generally
willing
to
approve
extra
spending
if
they
truly
understand
why
the
spending
be
important
believe
it
will
make
a
difference
and
understand
the
consequence
of
not
do
it
throughout
my
career
i
ve
often
see
manufacturing
unit
that
be
under
the
responsibility
of
leader
with
no
operating
experience
some
of
these
leader
determine
how
much
the
business
can
afford
and
set
strict
budget
no
excuse
i
ve
see
some
of
these
leader
turn
down
request
for
extra
spending
even
though
the
work
be
necessary
lack
of
appropriate
funding
be
one
of
the
cause
of
the
bp
texas
city
incident
in
which
process
hazard
have
be
identify
but
insufficient
fund
be
provide
a
similar
example
be
in
one
of
our
joint
venture
when
i
be
vice
president
of
eh
s
at
dow
this
joint
venture
have
be
form
about
five
year
previously
and
the
plant
manager
be
a
good
experienced
dow
person
the
joint
venture
be
operate
independently
of
dow
and
the
plant
manager
report
directly
to
the
business
vice
president
an
unusual
reporting
relationship
for
dow
plant
at
the
time
an
incident
occur
in
which
an
employee
be
severely
burn
from
an
equipment
failure
in
a
boiler
unit
upon
investigation
and
follow
up
discussion
we
realize
the
joint
venture
be
not
be
operate
or
maintain
up
to
dow
standard
the
plant
manager
told
me
how
frustrate
he
have
be
since
take
the
job
he
have
told
the
vice
president
many
time
about
the
problem
and
the
extra
cost
need
to
get
the
plant
up
to
standard
he
say
the
vice
president
told
him
they
couldn
t
afford
it
the
expense
would
kill
the
business
the
plant
manager
be
in
an
unfortunate
position
of
reporting
to
a
bad
leader
and
as
a
result
have
operate
the
plant
in
poor
condition
result
in
an
unfortunate
injury
at
the
time
dow
be
make
billion
of
dollar
in
profit
blame
a
serious
injury
or
fatality
on
lack
of
affordability
in
a
business
unit
or
subsidiary
wouldn
t
have
pass
the
red
face
test
in
my
independent
position
as
vice
president
of
eh
s
i
be
able
to
help
persuade
the
business
to
provide
necessary
funding
for
the
plant
i
also
learn
to
increase
our
independent
functional
audit
and
check
of
operating
unit
to
proactively
assure
all
be
follow
our
management
system
expectation
and
maintain
facility
in
good
shape
these
example
show
that
improperly
maintain
an
asset
be
sometimes
due
to
the
individual
unit
cost
and
profitability
restraint
of
a
particular
business
not
the
restraint
of
the
entire
company
the
business
leader
have
his
her
scorecard
which
can
cause
conflict
with
core
value
of
the
company
through
the
year
i
often
found
disconnect
between
the
ceo
of
a
company
and
the
leader
of
unit
function
and
business
down
in
the
organization
i
have
yet
to
find
a
good
ceo
who
want
any
of
his
her
unit
to
be
operate
in
poor
condition
or
in
an
unsafe
manner
this
issue
be
another
reason
why
manufacturing
and
eh
s
should
have
strong
independent
voice
at
the
top
of
the
organization
to
help
resolve
such
conflict
of
priority
i
ve
also
witness
multiple
occasion
when
a
poor
plant
manager
delayed
much
need
maintenance
know
that
he
would
soon
be
transfer
to
another
unit
the
delayed
maintenance
typically
involve
unseen
item
such
as
internal
equipment
inspection
later
the
next
manager
and
the
company
suffer
much
more
by
the
reliability
problem
cause
by
the
lack
of
proper
maintenance
in
our
company
we
be
laser
focus
on
meeting
budget
but
we
be
even
stricter
if
a
manager
take
shortcut
and
neglect
regularly
schedule
maintenance
eliminate
this
type
of
work
be
not
an
acceptable
way
to
meet
budget
we
take
a
goal
zero
approach
for
inspection
with
no
overdue
inspection
allow
lack
of
preventative
maintenance
typically
cost
more
bottom
line
dollar
later
due
to
the
unscheduled
downtime
and
lose
sale
that
occur
have
say
all
of
this
don
t
get
me
wrong
i
have
always
have
a
relentless
focus
on
cost
control
as
it
be
essential
for
profitability
and
competitiveness
we
always
strive
to
be
the
low
cost
producer
and
be
prepared
for
downturn
in
the
economic
cycle
in
cyclical
business
your
company
and
all
of
your
competitor
continue
to
get
well
therefore
during
good
time
and
to
prevent
cost
increase
we
kept
our
budget
focus
on
the
bottom
of
the
economic

we

in

we

it
s
true

one
of
the
ethylene
plant
manager
come
into
our
meeting
and
give
a
passionate
presentation
he
claimed
that
some
of
his
ethylene
pip
have
too
much
corrosion
be
unsafe
and
he
didn
t
have
enough
budget
to
do
the
maintenance
i
be
upset
and
concerned
about
his
safety
comment
so
i
told
him
i
want
to
go
look
at
the
pip
follow
the
meeting
as
we
drove
into
the
entrance
of
his
unit
we
saw
eight
maintenance
people
painting
everything
along
the
entrance
to
the
plant
the
equipment
that
they
be
painting
look
fine
to
me
but
the
dutch
have
a
lot
of
pride
and
like
their
facility
to
be
perfect
i
ask
him
if
this
work
be
out
of
the
same
budget
that
he
have
for
his
unsafe
ethylene
pip
of
course
it
be
and
then
we
have
a
short
discussion
about
prioritization
after
talk
for
a
while
he
say
you
don
t
need
to
go
look
at
the
pip
we
ll
get
it
paint
he
finally
realize
he
really

the

important
work

you
dig
deep
enough
however
you
may
find
that
the
work
process
or
procedure
to
maintain
and
operate
the
equipment
be
insufficient
even
more
often
the
cause
of

may

exceptional
housekeep
be
a
cornerstone
of
a
goal
zero
operation
housekeep
should
be
a
basic
tenet
for
every
person
in
the
organization
from
ceo
to
the
front
line
operator
in
one
of
my
early
assignment
in
dow
s
texas
operation
the
unit
s
housekeep
be
terrible
and
the
unit
manager
didn
t
care
therefore
many
people
in
the
unit
didn
t
care
about
it
either
but
the
sloppy
housekeep
bother
me
around
that
same
time
i
remember
take
our
child
to
disneyland
and
marvel
at
the
wonderful
housekeep
in
the
park
i
saw
employee
immediately
pick
up
any
litter
that
hit
the
ground
and
clip
the
edge
of
grass
immaculately
i
knew
the
difference
between
disneyland
housekeep
and
what
we
be
tolerate
in
the
unit
be
leadership
expectation
shortly
after
our
disneyland
visit
a
new
site
manager
larry
wright
be
assign
to
texas
operation
he
insist
that
every
unit
in
the
site
maintain
excellent
housekeep
i
be
thrill
and
we
begin
to
immediately
clean
up
our
plant
you
could
see
the
pride
and
morale
improve
along
with
the
cleanup
larry
demonstrate
the
power
of
strong
leadership
from
that
moment
on
i
accelerate
my
passion
for
excellence
in
housekeep
we
conduct
a
minute
bucket
brigade
in
all
of
my
plant
once
per
week
immediately
after
lunch
everyone
participate
i
make
it
a
point
to
personally
cover
as
much
area
as
i
could
to
be
visible
to
as
many
employee
and
contractor
as
possible
the
bucket
brigade
make
a
big
impression
on
everyone
and
our
housekeep
be
always
second
to
none
another
example
be
on
one
of
my
visit
to
china
i
go
to
a
unit
our
company
have
acquire
in
a
large
industrial
complex
own
by
another
company
the
housekeep
be
very
poor
nothing
be
paint
and
weed
be
grow
everywhere
i
talk
to
employee
at
the
unit
and
convince
them
to
clean
up
and
to
send
picture
to
me
they
follow
my
guidance
and
the
improvement
over
the
next
few
month
be
remarkable
in
later
month
to
my
delight
they
say
the
unit
around
them
own
by
the
other
company
begin
to
take
notice
and
be
actively
work
to
improve
their
area
too
peer
pressure
work
one
of
our
plant
manager
in
france
and
a
good
friend
of
mine
jerome
mauvigney
coin
the
phrase
the
smolik
sweep
he
say
every
time
i
visit
the
plant
and
we
walk
around
i
would
casually
reach
down
as
we
be
walk
and
pick
up
any
piece
of
trash
that
i
saw
i
always
felt
it
be
a
good
way
to
set
a
good
example
and
demonstrate
our
expectation
i
chuckle
each
time
on
these
tour
as
other
people
in
our
group
would
start
pick
up
litter
too
good
housekeep
be
important
for
contractor
work
in
your
operation
if
the
work
area
be
clutter
when
they
begin
their
work
they
will
leave
the
site
in
even
bad
condition
however
if
they
start
with
a
clean
workplace
they
will
leave
it
clean
begin
by
make
sure
that
exceptional
housekeep
be
an
expectation
across
your
company
place
trash
container
in
convenient
location
throughout
the
unit
and
keep
them
empty
out
on
a
regular
basis
a
good
guideline
be
that
nothing
should
be
on
the
ground
unless
it
s
there
for
a
specific
reason
keep
area
paint
and
well
lit

important
in
so
many
way
it
build
employee
pride
housekeep
be
integral
to
safety
and
quality
performance
it
help

most
importantly
outstanding

that
could
occur

the

for

it

as
i
look
back
on
my

one
of
the
most

accomplishment
undoubtedly
be
simplify
the

work
process
and
then
organize
them
so
that

could
easily
access
the

we
essentially
update
every
mandatory
standard
that
apply

we
shorten
them
make
them
easy
to

that
be

we

the

the

should
drive

seem
so
obvious

three

therefore
it

even
when

adversity
he
taught
this
lesson
by
constantly
create

would
have
small

be
a
real
treat
for
us
his
real
objective

fascinate
with
the
concept
of
leadership
excellence
and
how
to
get
the
best
out
of
people
this
fascination
have
remain
with
me
throughout
my
life
i
paid
my
own
way
through
college

and
part
time

terrific
friend
in

and
we
be
all
in
a
similar
situation
with
not
much
extra
spending
money
on
spring
break
for
example
we
never
even
thought
about
go
to
cancun
or
any
other
hot
spot
we
be
out
hustle
some
work
to
make
a
little
extra
spending
money
in
the
long
run
we
all
look
back
and
know
that
it
didn
t
hurt
us
in
fact
this
experience

shape
our
behavior
and
work
ethic
for
the
rest
of
our
life
i
ve
always

strong
sense
of
curiosity
in
what
motivates

how
to
make
thing
well

tend
to
face
problem
in
a
positive
manner

the
problem
at

naturally
focus

s
true
i
don
t
give
up
easily
drive
change
take
persistence
since

resistant
to
change
if
you
believe
strongly
in
something
or
have
a
clear
vision
of
what
need

few
time

still
remember
the
people
