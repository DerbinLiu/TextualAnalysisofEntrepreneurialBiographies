my

figure
in
his

be
his
sister
rosalie
six
year
old
than
he
who
left
school
to
help
raise
her
sibling
these
early
circumstance
help
me
understand
my
father
s
personality
his
father
be
very
strict
and
not
particularly
love
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
the
only
real
mother
figure
be
a
near
contemporary
sweet
and
sensitive
but
overwhelmed
by
be
thrust
into
a
position
of
authority
well
before
she
be
ready
for
it
there
couldn
t
have
be
much
parental
love
for
all
those
child
with
the
father
ambitious
and
driven
and
no
real
mother
my
father
himself
be
never
very
good
at
personal
relation
of
the
intimate
kind
the
feeling
be
there
but
they
go
unexpressed
early
in
my
father
move
with
his
family
back
to
san
francisco
a
city
by
then
of
with
much
well
educational
and
medical
facility
than
los
angeles
could
offer
the
large
meyer
family
it
be
also
safer
i
remember
my
father
say
of
his
early
day
in
los
angeles
that
everyone
carry
a
derringer
and
almost
every
night
someone
be
shot
but
though
my
grandfather
may
have
be
pleased
with
the
move
my
father
a
young
boy
of
eight
immediately
become
embattle
he
be
a
loner
and
a
fighter
force
by
his
family
to
wear
clothes
include
a
white
starch
eton
collar
that
make
him
look
different
old
boy
at
school
would
put
the
young
one
in
a
circle
pit
them
against
each
other
the
fight
would
stop
only
when
someone
have
a
nosebleed
and
this
be
usually
my
poor
father
nonetheless
he
be
force
to
learn
to
fight
to
defend
himself
all
the
while
receive
severe
reprimand
from
his
father
for
his
rough
behavior
these
encounter
toughen
him
to
the
point
where
when
the
family
move
to
alameda
to
improve
his
mother
s
health
by
remove
her
from
san
francisco
s
fog
young
eugene
outfought
the
local
bully
who
have
previously
rule
the
playground
this
victory
have
the
dubious
effect
of
make
him
the
top
troublemaker
both
at
school
and
at
home
he
lead
the
young
child
in
rebellion
against
the
housekeeper
generally
make
mischief
and
tease

especially
harass
poor
rosalie
alameda
have
do
my
grandmother
no
good
and
it
prove
too
remote
to
be
practical
for
my
grandfather
so
after
a
short
time
the
family
move
back
to
san
francisco
it
be
the
third
change
of

hit
in
the
eye
by
a

as
a
fine
opportunity
they
make
the
move
to
new
york
in
at
that
time
my
father
be
seventeen
and
have
complete
his
first
year
of
college
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
vastness
of
this
country
and
the
awesome
size
of
new
york
then
a
city
of
three
and
a
half
million
with
its
great
luxury
and
contrast
slum
he
go
to
work
as
a
messenger
at
lazard
with
the
full
expectation
that
someday
he
would
succeed
to
his
father
s
position
there
with
just
three
week
notice
and
only

average
recommendation
from
berkeley

crammed
for
the
yale
entrance
examination
and
be
accepted
settle
down
to
an
excessively
grueling
schedule
he
knew
very
few
people
he
be
a
lonely
jewish
boy
from
the
west
so
he
study
all
the
time
and
take
extra
credit
with
an
occasional
break
for
a
workout
in
the
gym
no
doubt
both
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
social
life
and
because
he
be
driven
to
excel
he
emerge
as
a
phi
beta
kappa
and
with
his
extra
credit
skip
his
junior
year
and
graduate
in

twenty
one
without
experiment
with
smoking
no
doubt
the
he

a
great

less

t
allow
her
to

her
beautiful
figure
and
she
never
get
over
this
son
s
early
death
in
any
event
whether
it
be
because
of
my
father
s
feeling
about
george
blumenthal
or
because
of
his
instinct
to
go
it
alone
he
begin
to
veer
from
the
path
his
father
have
laid
out
for
him
after
a
variety
of
adventure
and
false
start
in
other
field
he
have
try
learn
law
at
night
but
it
bore
him
he
come
upon
a
book
the
map
of
life
by
william
edward
hartpole
lecky
that
suggest
that
a
man
s
life
should
be
plan
as
a
single
whole
in
which
each
stage
would
be
a
prologue
to
the
stage
that
follow
and
he
outline
such
a
plan
for
himself
the
first
twenty
year
be
over
they
be
generally
call
school
twenty
to
forty
would
be
give
to
growth
and
experimentation
during
which
he
would
earn
a
competence
marry
and
start
a
family
forty
to
sixty
would
be
a
time
for
implement
all
that
he
have
learn
and
do
prior
to
this
which
if
feasible
my
father
write
should
be
devote
to
public
service
he
would
retire
at
sixty
to
grow
old
gracefully
and
help
young
people
as
he
look
around
at
lazard
and
even
at
his
father
he
be
more
than
ever
convince
of
the
rightness
of
his
plan
for
life
the
lazard
bureaucracy
be
hopeless
with
old
men
make
all
the
decision
and
little
opportunity
for
a
bright
young
man
to
make
a
significant
contribution

paris
partner
control
the
company

be
take
out
many
young
lady
and
there

in
whom
he
be
really
interested
irene
untermeyer
the
daughter
of
the
lawyer
samuel
untermeyer
i
think
this
be
his
only
genuine
romance
before
he
met
my
mother
at
lazard
however
he
be
even
now
make
only
a
month
and
realize
as
do
irene
s
parent
i
m
sure
that
he
couldn
t
support
a
wife
on
that
by
this
time
the
cigarette
money
have
be
well
invest
and
he
have
save
he
parlayed
this
into
by
invest
in
railroad
stock
and
then
face
his
father
with
his
determination
to
leave
lazard
and
start
out
for
himself
it
be
an
emotional
moment
his
father
view
this
decision
as
the
rejection
of
his
lifetime
of
toil
in
his
son
s
behalf
when
the
young
man
go
far
and
told
his
father
that
he
be
go
to
buy
a
seat
on
the
stock
exchange
his
father
say
he
wouldn
t
help
him
but
my
father
announce
that
he
have
accumulate
the
then
necessary
and
could
do
it
without
any
help
my
grandfather
say
eugene
you
ve
be
gamble
which
be
how
he
view
play
the
market
my
father
s
first
move
on
his
own
quite
soon
after
leave
lazard
turn
out
to
be
trouble
he
unknowingly
affiliate
with
a
bucket
shop
a
kind
of
fraudulent
brokerage
house
when
he
discover
the
nature
of
his
associate
he
left
immediately
it
be
a
blow
but
now
his
father
stood
behind
him
state
that
he
want
his
son
to
invest
his
own
fund
and
expect
others
in
the
family
to
do
the
same
even
blumenthal
do
after
this
rocky
start
my
father
withdrew
to
palm
beach
to
think
thing
over
and
there
he
drew
up
a
plan
for
develop
a
business
this
memo
outline
a
very
simple
but
high
mind
strategy
of
associate
with
the
best
people
acquire
know
security
stay
with
them
and
be
constructive
not
destructive
such
think
lead
him
to
start
his
own
firm
eugene
meyer
and
company
which
open
in
and
gradually
he
begin
to
make
his
mark
on
wall
street
and
to
do
well
for
himself
and
his
associate
by
he
have
make
several
million
dollar
at
the
time
he
start
the
firm
it
must
have
be
very
difficult
compete
with
the
large
and
well
know
house
in
time
however
he
come
to
know
the
head
of
these
firm
i
always
heard
him
say
he
have
the
great
admiration
for
e
h
harriman
father
of
averell
and
a
very
dominant
figure
i
think
he
felt
very
small
and
insecure
next
to
harriman
morgan
and
the
other
then
reign
titan
and
he
be
gratify
when
they
start
to
notice
what
he
be
do
he
quote
one
of
them

say
watch
that
fellow

ll
have

philosophy
of
investment
involve
careful
research
into
company
the
first
in
depth
economic
analysis
of
its
kind
this
be
typical
of
his
lifelong
impulse
to
get
at
the
fact
before
make
judgment
eugene
meyer
and
company
in
fact
have
the
first
research
department
of

more
and
more

should
like
myself
to
come

he
be
aware
of

he

only
when

as
an
extraordinary
oedipus
complex
her
early
childhood
be
infinitely
brighten
by
this
luminous
personality
as
she
refer
to
him
my

would
take
her
for
walk
to
see
the

about
music
poetry

of
wagner

and
sang
mozart
aria
around
the
house
particularly
one
from
don
giovanni
which
i
well
remember
since
in
her
excitement
she
hum
it
out
loud
when
we
go
to
see
the
opera
together
much
later
in
her
life
she
be
certainly
infatuate
with
her
father

with
her
unfortunately
as
time
go
on
he
philander
tipple
and
cease

the
family
bill
and
she
felt
betrayed
by
him
the
man
she
have
love
as
a
child
be
replace
by
what
she
call
a
somber
figure
that
haunt
my
adolescence
like
a
nightmare
in
addition
to
their
schoolwork
my
mother
and
her
three
old
brother
be
tutor
at
home
in
german
and
math
when
bill
and

for
high
school
and
fred
for
college
the
family
move
to
new
york
to
benefit
from
its
excellent
free
public
education
she
have
to
adapt
to
new
way
to
cease
battling
with
boy
to
go
to
an
all
girl
school
she
thrive
however
in
the
stimulate
learn
atmosphere
of
morris
high
school
where
she
study
latin
greek
ancient
history
math
french
and
american
and
english
literature
during
her
high
school
year
her
relationship
with
her
father
continued
to
deteriorate
as
he
get
far
involve
with
woman
drank
more
and
increasingly
neglect
his
work
and
his
family
he
no
longer
earn
a
living
but
instead
write
what
his
daughter
frankly
call
incredibly
amateurish
book
and
drama
the
family
bill
go
unpaid
and
agnes
s
mother
grow
more
and
more
anxious
this
undoubtedly
be
the
dominant
emotional
shock
of
my
mother
s
life
it
turn
everything
upside
down
and
her
adoration
of
her
father
turn
to
shame
and
even
to
hatred
bad
of
all
have
taught
her
to
love
learn
he
no
longer
care
if
she
go
to
school
he
would
have
prefer
her
go
to
work
to
help
pay
the
bill
so
long
last
and
painful
be
these
emotion
about
her
father
that
although
she
spoke
often
with
us
about
him
she
hardly
ever
mention
this
dark
side
and
then
only
by
allusion
i
eventually
come
to
realize
that
her
very
ambivalent
attitude
toward
men
clearly
sprang
from
this
experience
she
be
both
attract
and
repel
by
the
whole
idea
of
sexual
relation
however
she
do
keep
his
picture
on
her
desk
always
a
handsome
man
the
estrangement
from
her
father
have
the
salutary
effect
of
make
her
realize
she
have
to
work
even
harder
to
win
scholarship
to
college
and
earn
the
money
to
pay
her
own
expense
hard
work
also
help
counteract
her
fear
that
in
many
way
she
be
much
like
her
father
and
have
within
herself
some
of
his
weakness

be
very
independent
and
irreverent
and
as
a
result
be
label
too
irresponsible
to
deserve
far
scholarship
at
which
point
she
determine
to
earn
the
daunt
sum
of
that
be
necessary
for
her
to

conceited
and
self
center
to
an
unbelievable
degree
for
several
year
to
come
i
be
in

with

ecstasy
that
cost

and

me
of
this
intoxication
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
life
have
hardly
cure
her
of
her
self
absorption
agnes

force
to
return
for
her
senior
year
with
only
two
hour
of
formal
study
to
complete
but
this
turn
out
to
be
a
blessing
in
disguise
because
it
be
in
her
final
year
that
she
developed
the
first
of
a
series
of
intellectual
yet
highly
emotional
crush
on
men
of
distinction
most
of
them
in
art
or
letter
she
be
often
consume
by
these
strangely
passionate
friendship
with
well
know
men
my
father
be
once
heard
to
mutter
there
s
always
a
stranger
in
the
house
the
first
of
these
crush
be
on
john
dewey
as
president
of
the
college
s
philosophical
society
she
have
invite
dewey
to
speak
and
then
get
to
know
him
well
through
his
daughter
evelyn
a
classmate
who
would
take
her
home
to
family
meal
and
she
read
everything
he
d
write
she
believe
that
his
teach
to
live
life
on
a
high
plane
make
her
come
to
term
with
the
many
frustration
hardship
and
disappointment
of
my
college
year
i
believe
i
would
never
have
married
the
man
i
do
the
great
good
that
ever
befell
me
if
dewey
have
not
counteract
my
sturm
und
drang
with
his
inspire
common
sense
as
she
write
later
when
she
told
her
family
that
she
intend
to
do
newspaper
reporting
my
mother
wept
and
my
father
say
solemnly
i
would
rather
see
you
dead
in
those
day
educate
woman
work
either
at
teach
or
at
clerical
work
and
there
be
only
a
half
dozen
woman
in
journalism
most
of
them
sob
sister
so
it
be
quite
a
remarkable
feat
when
my
mother
first
start
work
on
a
freelance
basis
for
the
new
york
sun
she
do
piece
work
which
put
a
terrible
strain
on
her
to
get
or
think
up
enough
story
to
support
her
family
her
income
range
from
a
high
of
a
week
to
a
low
of
or
but
she
persist
and
soon
become
know
as
the
sun
girl
the
quest
for
copy
lead
her
one
day
to
a
new
modern
art
gallery
at
fifth
avenue
there
for
the
first
time
photograph
be
present
as
art
and
she
thought
that
the
very
avant
garde
group
of
photo
secessionist
work
there
lead
by
alfred
stieglitz

edward
steichen
and
include
the
painter
georgia
o
keeffe
john
marin
and
marius
de
zayas
make
a
real
story
she
become
so
excite
about
the
idea
and
people
she
found
there
they
be
ever
after

the
rest
of

down

six
hour
straight
though
my
mother
have
no
sympathy
with
political
radical
she
related
totally
to
the
artistic
rebellion

by
the

quite
by
accident
stumble
upon
a
small
room
of
chinese
painting
there
she
suddenly
and
inexplicably
fell
in
love
at
first
sight
completely
hopelessly
and
forever
with
chinese
art
she
vowed
to
explore
this
attitude
toward
life
to
its
uttermost
depth
which
she
do
over
the
next
several
year

her
artist
and
bohemian
friend
and
my
father
s
renew
attention
and
she
must
have
discover
the
awful
truth
that
the
beloved
merkel
be
no
longer
interested
in
her
in
any
case
she
grow
more
interested
in
my
father
at
a
lunch
at
the
waldorf
astoria
she
told
him
that
she
felt
the
need
to
go
back
to
europe
to
think
thing
over
have
decide
that
problem
in
the
taft
administration
would
lead
to
a
recession
he
have
convert
his
asset
to
cash
to
wait
out
the
inevitable
effect
on
wall
street
so
he
respond
i
have
decide
to
get
away
for
a
bit
myself
and
told
her
of
his
plan
to
take
time
off
for
a
trip
around
the
world
why
how
long
be
you
go
to
be
away
she
ask
in
hurt
surprise
oh
at
least
six
month
he
reply
when
she
suddenly
realize
that
he
might
not
be
there
wait
for
her
forever
she
quickly
respond
i
m
go
with
you
i
know
he
reply
i
have
your
ticket
three
week
later
they
be
married
at
her
home
in
a
very
simple
lutheran
ceremony
with
only
the
two
family
present
even
the
account
in
the
new
york
paper
mention
that
their
friend
be
surprised
he
be
thirty
four
she
only
twenty
three
what
be
her
motif
and
indeed
what
be
his
do
she
marry
him
to
escape
the
problem
of
her
family
for
security
for
money
certainly
she
concede
that
his
money
be
not
irrelevant
to
her
decision
in
her
autobiography
she
admit
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
me
to
marry
anyone
who
be
not
well
to
do
for
the
only
dowry
i
have
to
bring
a
husband
be
my
father
s
debt
and
my
own
the
fact
that
i
could
confess
to
eugene
the
perpetual
nightmare
of
my
relationship
to
my
father
be
a
release
from
deep
inner
tension
it
give
me
the
sharpest
realization
that
i
be
no
longer
alone
in
the
world
and
the
add
blessing
that
henceforth
i
would
be
free
of
a
crush
burden
of
debt
let
no
one
undervalue
the
importance
of
economic
independence
hers
be
secure
to
be
sure
my
father
not
only
paid
off
her
father
s
debt
even
before
they
left
on
their
honeymoon
but
also
generously
support
frederick
ernst
until
his
death
in
and
her
mother
be
secure
and
yet
mother
certainly
love
my
father
in
her
own
peculiar
way
all
her
life
she
look
up
to
him
admire
his
brain
strength
and
quality
of
leadership
perhaps
one
passage
in
her
european
diary
provide
some
insight
into
why
she
married
him
as
well
as
some
insight
into
her
own
consume
sense
of
self
i
write
e
m
jr
a
birthday
letter
yesterday
one
of
the
great
thing
i
have
ever
write
if
i
have
any
doubt
of
the
value
of
his
personality
they
would
be
swept
aside
by
this
one
fact
that
he
demand
greatness
of
me
with
all
people
that
be
the
test
of
test
for
me
for
his
part
he
be
ready
to
be
married
and
have
a
family
her
picture
show
her
as
marvelously
good
look
and
she
be
obviously
a
highly
sought
after
intelligent
young
woman
from
the
first
sight
in
the
museum
he
must
have
be
dazzle
determine
and
patient
do
the
fact
that
he
be
jewish
trouble
her
i
think
it
must
have
she
refers
to
it
in
her
early
letter
home
from
paris
despite
her
strong
lutheran
background
my
mother
be
not
particularly
religious
either
but
clearly
she
share
the
latent
anti
semitism
of
the
period
at
least
to
some
extent
my
guess
be
that
from
her
point
of
view
his
be
jewish
be
outweigh
by
his
other
strength
and
appeal
i
think
she
also
be
so
young
and
unrealistic
and
have
have
so
much
go
her
way
despite
her
family
problem
that
she
thought
his
be
jewish
wouldn
t
affect
her
i
can
only
surmise
that
her
ego
and
self
assurance
be
such
that
when
she
married
my
father
she
thought
he
might
come
to
be
consider
as
not
jewish
rather
than
she
as
jewish
she
be
deeply
hurt
however
after
her
marriage
by
suddenly
be
touch
by
social
discrimination
in
new
york
her
decision
to
marry
eugene
meyer
sprang
no
doubt
from
a
mix
of
reason
in
any
case
she
certainly
startle
everyone
by
this
marriage
and
there
be
those
who
thought
it
wouldn
t
last
but
of
one
thing
i
be
sure
despite
moment
of
great
stress
and
difficulty
in
my
parent
marriage
they
never
look
back
after
two
week
at
my
father
s
farm
in
mount
kisco
new
york
which
he
have
bought
some
year
earlier
the
newlywed
set
out
in
a
private
railroad
car
the
constitution
for
their
honeymoon
trip
around
the
world
he
with
a
valet
and
she
with
a
maid
they
make
their
way
across
america
stop
at
one
point
in
montana
to
see
my
father
s
copper
mining
friend
big
bill
thompson
my
mother
be
wear
her
wedding
present
a
string
of
perfectly
match
pearl
though
they
be
not
especially
big
this
be
in
the
day
before
culture
pearl
and
these
be
quite
rare
she
wore
them
all
her
life
as
they
be
leave
accord
to
family
lore
mr
thompson
turn
to
her
husband
and
say
bill
do
you
see
those
pearl
when
he
say
yes
she
query
well
what
be
you
go
to
do
about
it
by
the
time
the
newlywed
reach
san
francisco
where
they
be
to
visit
with
the
california
member
of
the
meyer
family
for
a
week
before
go
on
my
mother
s
maid
hadn
t
work
out

found
a
train
nurse
who
want
to
travel
and
be
willing
to
do
what
be
necessary
although
she
knew
nothing
about
what
be
expect
or
need
so
the
unsatisfactory
maid
be
replace
by
a
lady
name
margaret
ellen
powell
a
practical
nurse
and
a
christian
scientist
and
the
salt
of
the
earth
it
be
the
lucky
thing
that
ever
happen
for
all
of
us
meyer
child
since
powelly
as
we
all
come
to
call
her
stayed
to
bring
us
up
when
my
parent
return
from
their
honeymoon
and
settle
back
into
new
york
my
mother
be
pregnant
my
father
go
back
to
wall
street
and
she
have
to
begin
make
the
necessary
adjustment
to
be
a
married
woman
overnight
she
found
herself
living
a
wealthy
life
and
run
household
she
once
told
me
of
think
as
she
rode
in
a
chauffeur
driven
car
can
this
really
be
me
as
she
herself
acknowledge
she
have
a
difficult
time
especially
in
the
first
year
long
before
i
be
born
the
fourth
child
of
five
she
have
rarely
thought
about
what
marriage
entail
in
the
way
of
relationship
to
spouse
and
child
i
m
not
sure
she
be
ever
really
able
to
she
seem
to
regard
her
marriage
as
a
contract
she
would
always
keep
and
in
her
way
she
do
her
duty
as
she
saw
it
lay
in
have
and
rear
child
run
the
house
and
be
there
when
need
to
fulfill
her
obligation
as
a
hostess
after
that
like
so
many
of
today
s
woman
but
way
ahead
of
her
time
she
be
determine
to
maintain
her
own
identity
and
intellectual
life
in
her
own
world
she
go
her
own
way
later
in
a
memoir
she
explain
how
she
felt
at
the
time
i
rebel
inwardly
and
outwardly
against
the
suddenly
impose
responsibility
of
marriage
during
the
first
few
year
i
behave
as
if
the
whole
world
be
in
a
conspiracy
to
flatten
out
my
personality
and
cast
me
into
a
universal
mold
call
woman
so
many
of
my
married
college
friend
have
renounce
their
intellectual
interest
and
lose
themselves
in
a
routine
of
diaper
dinner
and
smug
contentment
with
life
that
i
be
determine
this
should
not
happen
to
me
i
want
a
big
family
but
i
also
want
to
continue
my
life
as
an
individual
i
believe
she
be
often
desperately
unhappy
in
her
marriage
especially
at
first
she
go
to
a
psychiatrist
on
whom
she
lean
heavily
she
try
to
escape
any
problem
with
her
marriage
and
motherhood
by
study
chinese
art

much
well
investment
my
father
s
investment
in
copper
car
and
later
chemical
be
all
indicative

marriage
brought
a
number
of
personal
trouble
and
tragedy

bad
be
the
loss
of
the
young
meyer

partner
and
much
love

go
down

only
twenty
eight
my
father
have
be
his
much
old
brother
almost
a
father
figure
and
certainly
a
mentor
and
he
be
painfully
bereft
he
be
not
close
to
many
people
edgar
have
be
one
of
the
very
few
he
have
my
mother
of
course
who
always
stood
behind
him
staunchly
when
he
need
it
but
who
seem
increasingly
to
resent
run
the
big
house
who
disliked
social
obligation
and
who
be
shock
and
discourage
by
the
pain
of
childbirth
she
ask
her
obstetrician
during
florence
s
birth
why
anyone
have
a
second
baby
as
she
herself
write
i
become
a
conscientious
but
scarcely
a
love
mother
by
she
have
have
my
second
sister
elizabeth
or
bi
as
she
be
always
know
and
be
chafe
so
over
what
she
felt
as
the
crush
of
her
personality
that
my
father
encourage
her
to
go
abroad
they
initially
thought
of
go
together
but
the
gathering
war
cloud
concerned
him
and
he
decide
to
stay
home
to
look
after
his
by
now
very
large
business
in
addition
give
her
frustration
in
acclimate
to
marriage
and
a
family
they
both
saw
the
need
for
some
distance
between
them
so
they
agree
that
she
would
take
the
trip
to
europe
alone
and
they
would
correspond
often
indeed
all
her
life
my
mother
found
it
easy
to
communicate
from
a
distance
and
she
converse
with
us
child
at
least
as
much
through
letter
as
she
do
in
person
i
take
this
form
of
communication
for
grant
for
some
reason
when
she
be
in
her
old
age
and
during
my
middle
year
she
suddenly
give
me
the
letter
that
she
and
my
father
have
exchange
while
she
be
abroad
in
i
m
not
sure
why
the
strain
between
them
be
ill
conceal
in
these
letter
which
freely
express
their
difference
his
fairly
unreasonable
anger
and
jealousy
and
her
conflict
emotion
her
first
letter
to
him
be
write
in
may
while
she
be
still
on
the
german
steamship
the
vaterland
head
for
bremen
her
very
first
letter
ask
why
he
have
left
the
boat
so
long
before
it
sail
she
be
quite
crush
and
end
the
letter
with
kiss
my
baby
i
have
left
my
heart
with
you
and
them
she
seem
to
have
quickly
get
over
any
sadness
at
leave
them
however
since
the
next
letter
be
full
of
detail
about
her
active
social
life
on
board
she
have
be
take
up
by
the
very
distinguish
mr
stotesbury
of
philadelphia
she
alternate
these
social
detail
with
more
intimate
comment
at
one
point
she
asks
be
you
think
of
me
lovingly
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
have
temporarily
desert
you
this
be
a
revolutionary
age
even
for
the
marital
relationship
and
i
hope
that
you
will
not
cease
have
confidence
in
me
and
love
me
when
i
have
a
period
of
think
thing
out
it
only
mean
that
my
feeling
for
you
will
be
clearer
and
therefore
finer
much
of
the
european
trip
be
a
reconstruction
of
the
artistic
life
she
have
create
as
a
student
there
she
look
at
and
bought
book
and
art
in
berlin
vienna
and
paris
she
go
with
de
zayas
to
see
what
she
call
the
ultra
modern
she
expect
to
be
horrify
particularly
by
picasso
s
work
since
she
have
heard
he
use
piece
of
wallpaper
newspaper
and
other
actual
thing
with
which
to
construct
his
picture
but
she
found
his
work
large
as
life
and
fascinate
and
bought
a
small
still
life
of
a
pipe
a
glass
a
bottle
and
some
grape
the
grape
have
be
set
in
sawdust
she
call
it
a
real
work
of
art
and
paid
for
it
fairly
early
on
she
commit
an
almost
fatal
error
from
the
point
of
view
of
her
relationship
with
my
father
she
go
for
tea
to
the
apartment
of
an
old
friend
alfred
von
heymel
whom
she
have
met
in
berlin
through
her
onetime
beau
otto
merkel
the
summer
of
her
student
year
instead
of
make
thing
well
as
she
thought
her
write
from
this
distance
would
her
letter
about
this
unchaperoned
visit
prompt
a
wonderfully
old
fashion
row
she
have
told
my
father
quite
casually
about
go
to
von
heymel
s
apartment
alone
but
add
that
he
should
not
be
shock
since
the
place
be
full
of
domestic
there
follow
from
my
father
all
carefully
preserve
two
letter
of
uncontrolled
and
repetitive
rage
at
her
have
go
alone
to
a
man
s
apartment
she
cable
and
write
back
that
there
be
a
misunderstand
and
try
to
give
her
side
of
the
incident
but
it
be
no
use
the
detail
didn
t
matter
to
him
what
do
matter
be
that
he
have
to
have
confidence
in
her
he
enumerate
other
occasion
when
he
felt
she
hadn
t
use
good
sense
he
felt
that
the
liberty
he
want
her
always
to
feel
be
hers
be
be
abuse
and
that
if
she
really
care
she
would
understand
the
serious
consequence
of
her
thoughtlessness
incredibly
after
say
all
this
he
say
he
hop
nothing
in
this
sound
like
lecture
and
preach
signing
the
letter
with
fond
love
despite
the
misunderstanding
on
both
side
about
this
ill
fat
von
heymel
visit
she
carry
on
with
her
trip
and
her
letter
she
write
my
father
that
she
recognize
that
her
whole
existence
have
be
devote
to
life
whereas
his
have
be
devote
to
work
she
also
say
she
hadn
t
be
give
to
him
which
she
conclude
be
not
entirely
her
fault
we
have
often
scarcely
see
each
other
we
have
live
in
the
market
place
instead
of
building
up
a
shrine
of
our
own
she
thought
even
their
town
house
reflect
this
distance
between
them
we
have
no
room
where
one
feel
you
and
i
actually
live
she
admit
to
him
that
in
the
last
year
she
have
be
terribly
restless
and
dissatisfied
and
could
feel
his
uneasiness
i
do
not
blame
you
only
a
blind
man
could
have
fail
to
be
uneasy
about
the
woman
who
left
you
but
i
do
not
think
you
will
be
uneasy
about
the
woman
who
return
indeed
in
the
letter
she
write
during
this
interlude
she
try
to
be
supportive
of
him
and
analytical
about
herself
but
to
little
avail
he
write
a
final
letter
complain
that
she
hadn
t
write
as
often
as
she
have
promise
that
she
be
always
in
a
hurry
and
that
she
would
be
come
home
tire
instead
of
rest
this
letter
end
with
you
say
be
happy
and
know
that
i
shall
work
for
you
always
in
any
and
every
way
this
be
a
smart
expression
and
i
be
sure
you
would
do
so
if
you
happen
to
think
of
it
think
after
all
be
what

absorbed
to
the
extent
of

have
be
less

in
washington
unlike
the
many
woman
who
to
this

determine

happiness

her
talent

day
affection

of
human
contact
even
the
love
that
my

and
salve
our

somewhat
unusual
my

didn
t
much
believe
in
doctor

hardly
ever
saw
one
through
most
of
my
youth
and
powelly
be
a
devout
christian
scientist
so
illness
wasn
t
acknowledge
by
her
if
we
say
we
have
a
tummy
ache
or
a
cold
she
would
say
just
know
it
s
go
to
be
all
right
and
off
we
d
go
with
any
disease
or
even
a
fever
i
do
stay
home
from

renew
vigor

three
hundred
social
call

a
relatively
short
period
of
time
which
meant

with
one
corner
turn
down

that
she
have
personally
left
them
she
despise
do
this
say
she
do
it
not
only
because
of
eugene
s
much
wider
association
but
because
i
have
to
put
us
back
on
the
social
map
this
game
take
more
persistence
and
courage
than
anyone
will
admit
she
confide
to
her
diary
that
i
cannot
hide
the
fact
that
my
sympathy
be
deeper
my
interest
more
serious
than
those
of
most
of
these
woman
in
fact
that
be
true
they
be
as
for
me
when
i
reach
the
age
of
four
washington
become
my
home
and
remain
so
forever
at
first
we
move
into
a
large
dark
red
brick
house
on
connecticut
avenue
described
by
my
mother
in
her
diary
as
a
big
old
fashion
barn
she
add
the
child
be
happy
in
their
semicountry
life
and
we
be
all
glad
to
be
living
together
again
my
early
memory
be
of
this
house
where
i
be
quite
content
the
house
be
a
sprawl
victorian
mansion
with
a
stain
glass
bay
window
in
the
din
room
it
be
rent
from
the
woodward
of
the
woodward
and
lothrop
department
store
family
the
lothrops
have
built
an
equally
large
stone
house
a
block
away
the
land
around
the
house
extend
the
length
of
the
block
and
the
yard
become
a
playground
for
the
whole
neighborhood
one
of
the
early
transaction
i
have
with
my
father
about
the
future
take
place
in
this
connecticut
avenue
house
when
i
be
about
eight
he
kept
ask
if
when
i
grow
up
i
would
be
his
secretary
i
have
no
idea
what
a
secretary
be
or
do
but
the
whole
idea
struck
me
as
distasteful
at
the
time
my
father
himself
seem
to
me
a
rather
remote
and
strange
male
figure
whom
i
like
from
a
distance
but
thought
very
different
my
answer
be
a
constant
and
firm
no
although
i
have
an
awareness
that
this
be
a
tease
i
knew
it
be
something
i
didn
t
want
to
do
however
i
have
a
bank
in
which
you
insert
nickel
dime
and
quarter
and
when
it
reach
the
vast
sum
of
it
would
spring
open
i
have
be
collect
coin
for
month
on
my
tiny
allowance
and
finally
i
need
only
one
nickel
to
have
all
this
vast
wealth
at
my
command
when
i
ask
my
father
if
he
would
give
me
a
nickel
he
say
well
now
will
you
be
my
secretary
i
agree
i
sell
out
for
a
nickel
my
father
would
occasionally
refer
to
this
future
make
me
slightly
puzzle
and
anxious
but
i
never
thought
of
renege
on
the
bargain
and
be
always
refer
to
as
his
future
secretary
in
large
family
it
seem
it
be
hardest
to
be
either
the
first
or
the
last
child
that
be
certainly
true
in
ours
florence

and
vulnerable
her
taste

with
a
book

hand

to
my
mother

ideal
meyer
girl

need
while
grow
up
she
have
an
especially
difficult
time
with
my
mother
no
doubt
because
of
mother
s
inexperience
with
motherhood
and
her
lack
of
interest
in

a
hard
time
and
bill
as
he
be
always
know
do
especially
as
he
get
old
be
the
only
boy
of
five
child
would
be
difficult
in
any
family
but
it
be
particularly
so
in
ours
both
because
of
my
father
s
unapproachability
and
prominence
and
because
of
my
mother
s
awkwardness
with
men
but
my
mother
be
elate
at
his
birth
she
have
want
nothing
but
son
and
she
felt
as
she
admit
a
ridiculous
sense
of
achievement
even
as
a
young
child
bi
found
or
recruit
a
companion
rebel
in
bill
the
two
of
them
form
a
team
like
bi
bill
assume
a
defiant
stance
toward
the
grown
up
world
we
be
all
away
once
on
a
yacht
trip
and
bill
have
stayed
home
learn
to
fly
and
gain
his
pilot
s
license
he
told
my
mother
he
have
something
to
show
her
she
held
her
breath
fear
it
be
a
marriage
license
in
comparison
with
which
a
pilot
s
license
seem
benign
he
then
show
her
by
buzzing
our
house
in
mount
kisco
dip
his
wing
in
acknowledgment
from
as
early
as
i
can
remember
i
adore
my
old
sibling
but
particularly
bi
and
bill
i
be
desperately
eager
to
be
part
of
their
adventurous
life
and
terribly
envious
of
bi
s
nonconformist
image
i
really
even
want
to
be
her
i
envy
her
self
assurance
her
independence
her
dare
her
willingness
to
cut
up
and
row
with
the
family
i
would
have
like
to
be
a
dash
law
breaker
but
i
didn
t
have
the
proper
instinct
or
the
courage
and
i
be
always
scorn
for
passively
go
along
where
bi
be
a
rebel
i
follow
the
rule
i
be
goody
two
shoe
beg
to
be
take
along
with
bi
and
bill
wherever
they
go
naturally
they
consider
me
a
pain
bad
when
i
be
very
young
i
be
the
world
s
most
ignoble
tattle
tale
without
even
realize
what
i
be
do
i
didn
t
tell
on
the
old
one
to
be
mean
get
even
or
ingratiate
myself
with
my
parent
i
simply
have
no
idea
that
i
have
transgress
i
share
their
life
so
little
that
i
didn
t
understand
that
their
activity
be
meant
to
be
secret
and
be
merely
reporting
after
one
episode
when
i
be
about
four
bi
bill
and
flo
take
me
into
a
bathroom
at
mount
kisco
and
carefully
taped
my
mouth
shut
as
bi
remembers
the
big
tear
on
those
very
fat
cheek
almost
undid
me
it
be
so
sad
but
the
cause
be
just
as
the
fourth
of
five
child
i
be
oddly
shield
from
the
rigor
of
living
with
parent
who
demand
perfection
and
from
some
of
the
eccentricity
of
our
curious
upbringing
more
so
than
the
old
child
i
be
supervise
by
our
parent
from
afar
this
be
in
certain
way
lucky
because
grow
up
somewhat
alone
i
didn
t
experience
the
rule
and
heavy
hand
to
which
the
old
child
be
subject
by
the
time
i
be
grow
up
the
battle
between
the
child
and
the
parent
have
already
take
place
not
only
be
our
parent
busier
and
more
preoccupy
than
ever
but
my
impulse
be
always
to
please
only
later
do
i
observe
that
this
curious
passivity
left
me
freer
than
both
my
old
sister
and
brother
their
rebellion
somehow
left
them
more
enslave
and
affected
by
the
family
s
myth
and
wish
somehow
in
their
defiance
my
sibling
be
more
captive
of
the
negative
part
of
our
upbringing
so
my
position
in
the
family
turn
out
to
be
a
lucky
one
i
bore
neither
the
brunt
of
my
mother
s
newness
to
parenthood
nor
the
force
of
her
middle
age
trauma
as
my
young
sister
ruth
do
i
be
somehow
protect
luck
help
me
be
a
survivor
and
give
me
strength
but
at
the
time
what
i
really
want
be
a
place
in
the
remote
and
excite
world
of
my
old
sister
and
brother
as
bi
succinctly
put
it
later
i
be
safe
but
gypped
my
difficulty
be
much
more
tie
to
a
lack
of
guide
personal
relationship
for
i
have
more
or
less
to
bring
myself
up
emotionally
and
figure
out
how
to
deal
with
whatever
situation
confront
me
at
the
same
time
that
i
be
surround
by
extreme
luxury
i
lead
a
life
structure
and
in
many
way
spartan
circumscribed
by
school
and
lesson
travel
and
study
the
only
person
who
be
physically
affectionate
with
me
be
powelly
whom
i
emotionally
outgrew
when
i
be
about
seven
from
then
on
i
be
on
my
own
the
young
of
us
ruth
be
born
in
mount
kisco
in
july
i
be
lead
in
to
see
the
new
baby
lie
on
the
bed
in
the
guest
room
i
hadn
t
the
remotest
idea
how
the
baby
arrive
or
whence
it
come
and
don
t
remember
be
curious
i
be
just
in
awe
of
her
with
her
tiny
curl
up
finger
ruth
s
birth
the
last
in
our
family
seal
my
separation
from
the
old
three
who
view
ruth
and
me
as
a
pair
of
infant
ruthie
be
an
enchant
child
and
i
be
jealous
that
she
be
blonde
blue
eyed
and
beautiful
whereas
i
be
dark
and
pudgy
i
once
test
family
member
by
suggest
that
if
a
fire
broke
out
we
d
all
meet
in
ruthie
s
room
because
we
d
rush
to
save
her
first
no
one
contradict
this
thesis
or
get
the
point
of
my
test
ruthie
and
i
be
set
apart
as
a
duo
in
other
way
we
both
remain
under
powelly
s
care
as
the
old
one
outgrew
her
even
share
a
room
until
i
be
twelve
when
guest
be
present
at
dinner
which
be
nearly
every
night
ruthie
and
i
have
to
eat
alone
at
an
earlier
hour
every
summer
until
i
be
nine
and
allow
to
join
the
old
contingent
my
parent
take
the
three
of
them
on
a
trip
to
europe
or
in
alternate
year
on
a
camp
trip
out
west
while
the
others
be
off
enjoy
excite
adventure
ruthie
and
i
be
left
in
mount
kisco
with
our
governess
as
the
fifth
and
last
child
ruthie
receive
even
less
in
the
way
of
parental
attention
and
interest
and
more
in
the
way
of
be
attend
to
only
by
a
governess
or
nurse
naturally
because
we
be
always
consider
a
separate
unit
and
i
be
four
year
old
i
become
a
sort
of
parent
to
her
or
at
least
an
important
mentor
she
grow
increasingly
shy
gentle
and
unassertive
for
the
most
part
she
live
in
a
world
of
her
own
eventually
become
a
gift
devote
horsewoman
her
attention
be
focus
on
a
springer
spaniel
name
cricket
and
the
governess
mademoiselle
otth
whom
she
love
very
much
when
ruth
be
fifteen
the
dog
die
and
the
governess
be
sent
away
at
about
the
same
time
needle
to
say
ruth
s
heart
be
broken
when
mademoiselle
left
ruth
write
me
i
miss
her
so
very
very
much
if
somebody
that
i
didn
t
know
very
well
ask
me
which
i
love
well
mother
or
mlle
i
would
probably
say
i
love
mother
well
but
i
ll
tell
you
and
nobody
else
that
i
love
mlle
well
you
see
i
can
really
discus
and
talk
thing
over
with
her
i
guess
i
could
do
it
with
mother
too
but
boy
oh
boy
i
would
feel
so
small
afterwards
i
understood
only
too
well
how
she
felt
my
mother
later
write
up
these
event
in
a
story
that
she
try
to
sell
to
one
of
the
woman
s
magazine
i
be
indignant
that
she
be
use
her
daughter
s
grief
and
wound
in
this
way
but
she
calmly
reply
that
she
d
show
it
to
ruthie
and
that
ruthie
have
like
it
i
didn
t
believe
it
at
the
time
but
she
prove
to
be
right
when
ruthie
and
i
be
go
over
my
mother
s
paper
after
her
death
the
story
reappear
i
stupidly
tore
it
up
my
anger
return
at
the
sight
of
it
year
later
ruthie
told
me
she
have
resent
my
tear
it
up
and
thought
i
be
jealous
because
it
be
about
her
not
me
the
complexity
of
family
relation
be
too
deep
to
comprehend
this
incident
certainly
testifies
against
moral
certitude
mine
my
life
as
a
child
be
center
in
the
house
in
washington
and
in
our
summer
home
in
mount
kisco
at
that
time
it
be
an
eight
hour
train
trip
from
washington
through
new
york
and
on
into
the
country
but
we
make
the
trip
regularly
those
trek
engineer
by
mother
travel
with
five
child
several
canary
and
all
the
baggage
the
horse
go
separately
the
ambience
of
the
huge
country
house
be
wonderful
make
up
in
gaiety
what
it
may
have
lack
in
warmth
as
a
bachelor
my
father
have
bought
an
old
farm
and
have
add
to
it
over
the
year
until
his
property
reach
seven
hundred
acre
at
its
peak
which
be
most
of
my
childhood
originally
there
be
a
beautiful
old
farmhouse
which
he
have
use
and
where
the
family
live
in
summer
in
the
early
year
of
my
parent
marriage
before
they
decide
to
build
a
large
home
design
in
by
charles
platt
the
architect
my
mother
s
friend

select
to

oriental
art
gallery
in
washington
the
new
stone
house
be
built
to
be
live
in
year
round
so
that
my
father
could
commute
to
wall
street
by
car
or
the
excellent
commuter
train
since
my
parent
move
to
washington
in
we
use
it
only
from
early
summer
until
early
fall

but
also
our
boat
and
fishing
hole
in
a
once
a
summer
event
we
always
refer
to
this
neoclassical
country
house
as
the
farm
because
my
parent
thought
of
it
as
that
and
because
it
be
a
regular
work
farm
there
be
pig
and
chicken
as
well
as
jersey

large
and
bountiful
orchard
and

garden
at
the
foot
of

which
we
ate
fresh
vegetable
and
enjoy
magnificent
bouquet
of
flower
all
over
the
house
refresh
and
replace
every
day

even
sent
to

successive

very
grand

in
the
afternoon
after
morning
spent
on
lesson
all
my
life
i
have
ambivalent
emotion
about
mount
kisco
on
one
level
i
deeply
love
it
and
have
happy
time
there
when
i
be
young
largely
because
there
be
child
on
the
farm
as
i
grow
old
say
from
twelve
to
eighteen
i
go
on
think
of
the
farm
as
wonderful
because
as
a
young
child
i
have
thought
it
be
but
in
reality
throughout
my
later
childhood
i
have
no
friend
in
the
neighborhood
and
felt
completely
alone
there
it
be
not
until
i
be
much
old
that
i
realize
we
be
almost
totally
isolated
though
we
have
many
visitor
for
weekend
or
longer
there
be
little
or
no
local
social
life
only
later
do
i
learn
that
my
parent
have
suffer
from
local
anti
semitism
they
have
i
believe
be
warn
when
they
first
start
to
build
the
large
stone
house
that
they
would
be
snubbed
socially
and
in
fact
they
be
never
invite
to
their
neighbor
house
and
be
exclude
from
the
country
club
until
it
go
broke
at
which
time
they
be
ask
to
join
and
i
think
may
have
just
to
help
but
i
never
go
there
or
even
saw
it
until
the
end
of
my
mother
s
life
after
countless
return
visit
either
with
my
child
who
adore
the
farm
or
later
to
visit
one
or
both
parent
i
look
forward
to
be
there
only
to
have
painful
reality
return
five
minute
after
enter
its
beautiful
large
front
hall
the
old
i
get
the
more
i
disliked
the
loneliness
of
the
farm
but
in
my
childhood
day
it
be
as
i
write
my
father
when
i
be
ten
a
great
old
place
during

couple
of
block
from

circle
my
commute
to

a
little
longer

every
morning
about
eight
block
uphill
carry
my
roller

simply
whiz

carry
my
book
bag
in
one
hand
and
reserve
the
other
to
grab
the
lamppost
at
each
corner
in
order
not
to
go
fly
into
the
street
after
a
two

interim
on
massachusetts
avenue

a
large
house

by

place
just
off

i
be
then
in
the
seventh
grade
and
this
be
the
real
house
in
which
i
grow
up
my
home
in
washington
and
where
my
mother
live
for
the
rest
of

the
well
know
architect
john
russell
pope
and
initially
have
forty
room
it
be
a
very
grand
and
rather
formal
house
the
only
somewhat
cozy
room
on
the
main
floor
be
the
library
in
which
we
spent
most
of
our
time
my
sister
ruth
and
i
again
share
a
large
room
but
as
the

the
house
be
do
over
and
i
be
allow
to
choose
my
own
room
and
decorate
it
i
say
i
would
like
it
to
be
modern
a
special
modern
designer
create
a
plaster
fireplace
paint
white
with
no
mantel
and
the
room
have
quite
beautiful
make
to
order
modern
furniture
it
be
a
strange
contrast
to
and
an
odd
oasis
in
a
period
house
full
of
chippendale
furniture
as
well
as
painting
and
sculpture
c

to
join
its
twin
already
there
although
i
didn
t
realize
it
at
the
time
the
atmosphere
of
the
crescent
place
house
intimidate
some
of
my
friend
one
of
them
remembers
lunch
in
the
vast
din
room
just
the
two

call
that
unfortunate
seat
starvation
corner
and
try
not
to
sit
there
we
learn
to
keep
a
hand
on
our
plate
otherwise
they
would
be
remove
before

fork
return
from
our
mouth
to
this
day
i

din
room
when
the
butler
approach
and
ask
what
she
would
like
she
be
so
terrify
that
all
she
could
think
of

grapenuts
the
grapenuts
be
brought
and
set
before
her
by
the
butler
who
station
himself
behind
her
chair
mary

her
horror
as
the
sound
of
each
bite
echoed
from
every
corner
she
say
she
just
stop
come
down
to
breakfast
even
though
she
spent
several
weekend
with
me
when
her
father
and
mother
be
away
wherever

exist
on
a
strict
regimen
of
lesson
and
a
multiplicity
of
plan
activity
after

and
during
the
summer
too
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
rid
especially
on
the
mile

of

negative
note

child
this
time
they
i
be
still
too
young

much
careful

i

saw
these

us
closer
to
the
reality
of
life

make
us
more
independent
she
once
say
that
this
be
a
way
to
show
us
life
outside
large
house
i
suppose
it
do
but
the
lesson
have
its
limit
there
be
five
ranch
hand
on
the
trip
to
california
eleven
saddle
horse
and
seventeen
packhorse
not
exactly
rough
it
i
be
take
on
the
last
of
these
camp
trip
one
to
the
canadian
rockies
in
august
of
we
rode
through
the
mountain
on
western
saddle

my

kept
a
brief
diary
of
this
expedition
too
and
the
follow
excerpt
represent
an
aspect
of
her
philosophy
that
she
impose
on
us
the
fatigue
of
the
climb
be
great
but
it
be
interest
to
learn
once
more
how
much
far
one
can
go
on
one
s
second
wind
i
think
that
be
an
important
lesson
for
everyone
to
learn
for
it
should
also
be
apply
to
one
s
mental
effort
most
people
go
through
life
without
ever
discover
the
existence
of
that
whole
field
of
endeavor
which
we
describe
as
second
wind
whether
mentally
or
physically
occupy
most
people
give
up
at
the
first
appearance
of
exhaustion
thus
they
never
learn
the
glory
and
the
exhilaration
of
genuine
effort
mountain
climb
be
one
of
mother
s
favorite
occupation
but
she
never
succeed
in

and
visit
to
notre
dame
and
versailles
my
only
really
vivid
memory
of
this
entire
trip
be
of
the
suffocate
swirl
cigar
smoke
in
the
car
with
all
the
window
close
as
i
rode
with
my

rich
expensive
cigar

of
cuban
tobacco
and
have
one
lit
pretty
constantly
it
be
almost
unendurable
in
small
space
usually
car
or
train
with
close
window
but
i
gradually
get
use
to
it
or
at
least
come
to
term
with
it
he
have
a
private
keg
at
dunhills
where
they
kept
his
special
brand
of

his
own
brand
of
extremely
strong
bourbon
with
his
name
on
it

still
have
the
top
of
one
of
the
barrel
three
year
after
this
first
trip
to
europe
we
return
this
time
spending
a
lot
of
time
in
germany
most
memorable
for
me
be
a
visit
to
einstein
at
his
home
which
i
described
in
a
letter
to
my
father
who
have
remain
at
home
at
work
i
suppose
mother
have
told
you
that
we
met
einstein
he
be
simply
grand
his
hair
be
positively
a
nest
and
he
have
on
a
bright
blue
sort
of
over
all
suit
and
a
pipe
in
hand
his
wife
won
t
let
him
smoke
cigar
their
house
be
very
plain
but
awfully
pretty
near
a
lake
he
sail
a
boat
alone
it
s
built
with
a
very
flat
bottom
so
it
won
t
tip
over
when
he
get
absent
mind
when
people
see
his
boat
run
around
in
circle
they
know
that
a
new
theory
be
be
form
in
my
father
bought
a
ranch
in
kelly
wyoming
in

we
be
somewhat
unenthusiastic
about
go
although
we
love
it
once
we
arrive
it
make
me
sad
that
my
father

to
my
torture

my
height

this
time
my
mother

a
sudden
fit
of
economy
or
it
may
have
be
a
genuine

be
red
silk
since
the
back
of

a
not

odd
apparition
of

over
the
little
boy
with
the
expectable
disastrous
result
at
about
this
period
we
girl
be
all
send
away
for
sample
of
soap
and
shampoo
and
trading
them
in
the
playground
like
my
friend

also
collect
photograph
of
favorite
movie
star
greta

we
voraciously
read
movie
magazine
also
like
most
young
people
i
have
fantasy
but
i
recognize
them
even
then
as
be
just
that
one
be
that
it
would
be
great
to
be
a

wispy
vision

in
some
way
be
successful
and
have
people

who
i
be
the
strange
thing
be
that
after

some
small
extent
the
fantasy
come
true
i
always
found
this
hard
to
believe
both
pleasurable
and
a
little
embarrass
but
the
shadow
of
my

with
each

the
taller
girl
who
lead
as
i
do
often
found
it
difficult

in

come
slowly
i
didn
t
get
around
to
boy
for
year
one
new
year
s
eve
during
high
school
when
i
be
about
sixteen
i
go
with
my
family
to
one
of
the
famous
dance
give
by
evalyn
walsh
mclean
my
brother
be
nice
enough
to
cut
in
on
me
since
i
knew
virtually
no
one
we
dance
on
and
on
together
the
light
finally
go
out
an
electric
sign
lit
up
say
happy
new
year
auld
lang

this
be
the
last
new
year
s
eve
i
m
ever
go
to
spend
with
you
when
i
be
about
seventeen
i
make
a
determine
effort
to
learn
how
to
appeal
to
the
boy
in
the
stag
line
at
party
and
dance
i
notice
that
if
you
laugh
uproariously
at
the
silliest
joke
and
act
lively
as
though
you
be
have
a
wonderful
time
the
boy
thought
you
be
attractive
and
appeal
i
apply
this
knowledge
shamelessly
i
fake
it
but
achieve
a
passing
measure
of
popularity
so
i
gradually
make
my
way
through
party
in
washington
at
which
i
manage
not
to
get
stuck
with
one
boy
which
be
the
nightmare
i
knew
one
or
two
of
my
brother
s
friend
from
his
washington
school
day
and
there
be
boy
who
occasionally
take
me
to
the

while
at

i
be
invite

later
do
i
finally
find
real
male
friend
and
occasionally
beau

of
whom
i
frighten
away
through
diffidence
and
not
know
how
to
cope
i
work
hard
to

about
a

my
schoolmate
come
to
dread
the
never
change
clang
that
emanate
from
my
practice
room
but
i
do
learn
something
about
musical
structure
in
the
process
i
also
appear
in
a
one
act
melodrama
produce
by
the
dramatic
association
my
role
be
that
of
a

who
be
the
cause
of
numerous
death
i
be
interested
in
journalism
and
join
the
staff
of
the
school
magazine
appropriately
call
tatler
although
we
aim
to
be
influential
and
stir
our
editorial
focus
as
much
on
the
weather
as
on
social
issue
many
advertisement
appear
as
well
include
one
with
a

curve
a
good
home
in
a
redfence
corselette
at

as
an
upperclassman
i
also
have
my
first
certify
success
of
a
worldly
kind
to
my
stun
amazement
i
be
elect
president
of
the
senior
class
i
have
no
idea
of
anything
approximate
general
like
and
or
approval
of
me
by
others
it
give
me
inordinate
pleasure
but
it
give
my
father
even
more
at
school
we
be
much
more
concerned
with
sport
friend
and
vacation
than
with
the
real
world
in
fact
my
interest
in
politics
be
nil
through
most
of
my
early
school
year
i
remember
one
debate
during
the
presidential
campaign
of
in
which
follow
the
republican
pattern
of
my
parent
i
spoke
for
hoover
i
couldn
t
have
know
what
i
be
talk
about
i
only
knew
that
my
father
work
in
the
hoover
administration
and
i
believe
in
my
father
my
classmate
robin
kemper
daughter
of
james
kemper
a
prominent
chicago
democrat
spoke
for
roosevelt
it
seem
almost
automatic
that
we
should
all
espouse
our
parent
view
despite
my
success
in
high
school
i
left
madeira
with
scant
training
for
the
life
i
be
later
to
lead
i
still
felt
fairly
different
and
shy
and
believe
i
have
only
a
few
friend
apparently
my
classmate
didn
t
see
me
the
way
i
saw
myself
my
senior
yearbook
entry
describes
a
girl
know
for
her
laugh
and
her
manly
stride
my
class
prophecy
read
kay
s
a
big
shot
in
the
newspaper
racket
but
i
envisage
no
such
future
for
myself
or
in
fact
any
specific
future
at
all
rather
than
create
my
own
way
what
i
be
try
to
do
all
the
time
be
figure
out
how
to
adjust
to
whatever
life
i
found
i
would
have
prefer
to
be
trailblazing
and
of
course
adventurous
and
dare
like
bi
but
the
poem
chosen
to
accompany
my
class
picture
at

reveals
a
different
kind
of
person

with
the
triumphant
roosevelt

on
the

as

ray
of
sunshine
illuminate
his
handsome

with
remarkably
little

obtain
from
the
treasury
m
any
be
say
he
have
save
american
agriculture
from
disaster
during
my
childhood
when
my
father
be
busy
with
his
series
of
government
job
my
parent
be
mostly
absent
when
they
be
home
there
be
formal
moment
when
we
would
see
them
my
mother
always
have
her
breakfast
in
bed
and
my
father
usually
have
his
in
her
bedroom
on
a
small
table
beside
her
we
go
upstairs
to
see
them
for
a
little
while
before
we
go
our
separate
way
mother
sometimes
take
one
of
us
for
a
drive
in
the
park
in
the
afternoon
or
have
us
in
for
a
talk
in
her
bedroom
but
these
occasion
be
few
and
far
between
and
more
often
than
not
the
exchange
be
one
way
nonetheless
i
love
these
time
and
once
comment
that
since
she
be
so
busy
perhaps
we
should
make
appointment
to
meet
a
story
she
use
to
repeat
as
quaint
my
parent
go
out
to
dinner
most
evening
or
entertain
elaborately
at
home
sometimes
i
visit
with
mother
as
she
dress
or
when
she
be
be
massage
or
manicure
my
mother
impressed
me
as
be
incredibly
glamorous
regal
and
beautiful
and
i
be
secretly
proud
when
she
appear
at
school
function
elegantly
dress
but
though
i
be
deeply
fond
of
her
when
i
be
very
young
i
be
awed
by
and
terrify
of
her
at
the
same
time
with
the
rarest
exception
i
be
much
too
scar
ever
to
consider
disobey
on
the
few
occasion
i
do
the
result
make
a
last
impression
on
my
first
trip
to
europe
when
i
be
eleven
mother
told
bill
and
me
to
go
to
the
ship
s
barber
to
get
our
hair
cut
we
have
another
plan
bill
told
me
to
tell
her
there
be
a
line
wait
and
that
we
would
go
later
and
i
mindlessly
carry
out
his
order
something
i
tend
to
do
too
much
throughout
my
life
mother
somehow
found
out
there
wasn
t
any
line
at
the
barber
s
and
severely
reprimand
me
for
lie
which
i
wasn
t
even
aware
i
be
do
and
put
me
alone
in
my
cabin
i
be
crush
but
the
episode
make
an
indelible
impression
on
me
about
the
importance
of
tell
the
truth
a
few
year
later
as
a
freshman
in
high
school
i
transgress
again
on
the
coiffeur
front
i
cut
my
long
curly
black
hair
against
my
mother
s
will
i
await
her
reaction
with
fear
and
trepidation
and
be
puzzle
and
a
bit
humiliate
when
she
fail
to
notice
the
change
until
at
last
i
call
her
attention
to
it
she
then
shrug
it
off
leave
me
confuse
it
have
take
such
courage
to
do
child
watch
and
listen
to
their
parent
sometimes
critically
but
sometimes
unquestioningly
each
of
my
parent
influence
us
in
large
way
and
small
certain
of
their
habit
rubbed
off
and
left
their
mark
one
very
peculiar
habit
i
picked
up
unconsciously
from
my
mother
be
a
tendency
to
be
suspicious
and
tight
and
ungenerous
about
small
thing
though
she
be
very
lavish
in
some
way
she
would
complain
about
small
bill
she
receive
certain
that
people
be
cheat
her
she
would
buy
a
fur
and
say
you
have
to
be
careful
because
you
can
choose
one
and
they
ll
substitute
another
she
say
if
you
have
your
pearl
necklace
restrung
you
have
to
sit
and
watch
to
be
sure
you
get
your
own
pearl
back
she
be
mean
about
raise
for
people
in
the
house
she
literally
hat
to
give
thing
away
even
praise
or
encouragement
i
too
developed
an
inability
to
spend
money
along
with
a
dark
suspicion
that
people
be
take
advantage
of
me
and
an
inability
to
enjoy
give
many
of
these
habit
be
overcome
when
i
married
phil
graham
who
be
exceedingly
generous
and
imaginatively
give
some
habit
i
have
never
overcome
be
odd
one
i
inherit
from
my
father
despite
the
vast
scale
on
which
we
live
my
father
have
peculiar
fixation
on
certain
small
expense
he
preach
tiny
economy
with
zeal
use
thing
up
completely
never
waste
never
phone
if
you
could
wire
or
well
still
write
the
compulsion
i
be
still
left
with
be
turn
out
every
light
before
i
go
to
bed
at
night
to
this
day
alone
in
a
house
i
be
totally
unable
to
leave
a
light
on
i
will
go
up
and
down
hall
and
staircase
if
i
know
a
light
be
on
i
tell
myself
to
stop
that
it
doesn
t
matter
yet
then
i
go
and
turn
it
off
some
lesson
be
impressed
on
me
by
reverse
example
when
i
be
young
i
perceive
grown
ups
behaving
quite
oddly
at
time
i
remember
be
shock
or
dismayed
by
thing
i
observe
and
make
silent
vow
not
to
behave
as
they
do
when
i
grow
up
for
instance
my
mother
when
confront
with
a
line
wait
at
the
movie
would
go
up
to
the
box
office
and
say
i
be
mr
eugene
meyer
of
the
washington
post
and
demand
to
be
take
in
and
seat
at
that
time
she
do
indeed
get
in
i
cringed
with
embarrassment
and
hop
the
ground
would
swallow
me
up
it
have
such
a
last
effect
on
me
that
i
have
never
be
able
to
deal
with
headwaiter
in
restaurant
who
put
you
in
siberia
rather
than
the
well
part
of
the
restaurant
i
just
go
meekly
to
siberia
as
the
year
go
on
my
mother
seem
to
have
a
more
and
more
difficult
time
emotionally
she
become
increasingly
engross
in
her
friendship
with
the
series
of
men
in
her
life
only
one
of
which
i
believe
may
have
be
a
true
affair
the
one
with
bill
ward
she
be
constantly
beset
with
cold
pneumonia
or
various
other
illness
and
she
react
to
each
one
with
the
great
amount
of
care
self
pity
and
drama
demand
and
receive
constant
visit
with
all
of
us
dance
attendance
in
retrospect
i
wonder
if
depression
contribute
to
this
intense
concentration
on
her
health
she
also
start
to
drink
more
heavily
sometimes
start
as
early
as
ten
in
the
morning
at
least
during
one
period
in
her
life
this
be
a
problem
that
greatly
worried
my
father
and
be
an
escalate
burden
to
him
and
to
all
of
us
even
her
drinking
be
do
in
a
somewhat
eccentric
way
there
be
an
old
fashion
lock
whiskey
and
wine
closet
in
the
basement
to
which
only
my
father
have
the
key
so
he
would
have
to
make
repeat
trip
to
the
cellar
and
therefore
knew
exactly
how
much
she
be
drinking
of
course
admonishment
on
this
score
never
have
an
effect
the
surprising
thing
be
that
she
never
bought
whiskey
herself
or
ask
him
for
her
own
key
my
mother
s
effect
on
us
be
often
contradictory
we
receive
every
encouragement
for
what
we
accomplish
yet
her
ego
be
such
that
she
trample
on
our
incipient
interest
or
enthusiasm
if
i
say
i
love
the
three
musketeer
she
respond
by
say
i
couldn
t
really
appreciate
it
unless
i
have
read
it
in
french
as
she
have
mother
herself
read
constantly
until
the
week
she
die
philosophy
history
biography
and
all
the
english
american
french
german
and
russian
classic
she
have
only
scorn
for
people
who
read
light
novel
let
alone
trash
or
time
waster
the
summer
between
fourth
and
fifth
grade
i
spent
almost
entirely
by
myself
reading
in
a
room
on
the
third
floor
of
mount
kisco
where
i
go
through
all
of
duma
eight
volume
of
louisa
may
alcott
start
with
little
woman
treasure
island
and
a
stir
adventure
series
by
a
man
name
knipe
i
count
up
at
the
end
found
that
i
have
read
around
one
hundred
book
and
write
my
parent
that
i
be
positively
float
in
book
i
couldn
t
have
be
happier
unfortunately
this
early
passion
for
reading
somehow
diminish
after
the
fifth
grade
until
i
read
only
sporadically
a
little
later
on
i
be
concentrate
on
movie
magazine
redbook
and
cosmopolitan
later
still
i
resume
reading
particularly
love

great
expectation
and
dostoyevsky
s
crime
and
punishment
mother
set
impossibly
high
standard
for
us
create
tremendous
pressure
and
undermine
our
ability
to
accomplish
whatever
modest
aim
we
may
have
set
for
ourselves
fundamentally
i
think
we
all
felt
we
somehow
hadn
t
live
up
to
what
she
expect
or
want
of
us
and
the
insecurity
and
lack
of
self
confidence
she
breed
be
long
last
but
despite
whatever
personal
doubt
about
us
she
may
have
have
the
picture
of
her
family
she
present
to
the
world
be
unblemished
she
create
and
then
perpetuate
the
myth
of
her
child
s
perfection
from
her
point
of
view
we
be
all
happy
bilingual
overachiever
indeed
on
some
level
she
be
proud
of
us
she
use
to
compare
us
to
the
character
in
a
then
popular
novel
call
the
constant
nymph
about
an
eccentric
boisterous
and
madly
funny
family
know
as
the
sanger
circus
other
myth
she
propagate
about
us
be
that
meyer
girl
be
brighter
more
attractive
funnier
smarter
more
successful
this
or
that
in
short
well
than
anyone
else
most
important
she
felt
we
should
be
different
more
intellectual
eccentric
even
in
addition
there
be
expectation
of
us
for
social
success
also
difficult
to
define
and
deal
with
popularity
at
school
or
party
be
thought
to
be
a
necessity
for
meyer
girl
i
always
say
i
have
a
wonderful
time
at
a
party
whether
i
do
or
not
and
quite
often
i
didn
t
if
one
of
my
parent
come
to
school
or
college
i
thought
i
have
to
assemble
a
group
of
friend
so
that
i
could
at
least
give
the
appearance
of
be
in
an
acceptable
swim
when
we
be
very
young
the
mcleans
who
then
own
the
washington
post
give
child
s
party
at
which
expensive
favor
even
watch
be
give
to
their
guest
mother
told
me
in
what
poor
taste
this
be
and
that
she
wouldn
t
let
my
sister
go
a
friend
of
hers
suggest
that
perhaps
it
be
important
to
be
see
there
to
which
my
mother
respond
i
want
my
child
to
be
the
one
to
want
to
be
with
her
predisposition
to
think
this
way
also
meant
that
she
condescend
to
the
average
to
the
pedestrian
to
the
everyday
this
negative
view
of
the
commonplace
become
very
much
a
part
of
me
and
my
confusion
i
knew
that
i
wasn
t
any
of
the
thing
that
be
held
out
as
desirable
i
also
knew
that
i
want
to
fit
into
the
world
to
be
like
by
people
around
me
yet
i
adopt
a
lot
of
the
family
s
philosophy
as
do
my
old
sister
and
brother
i
remember
in
college
say
to
my
friend
mary
gentry
as
we
cross
the
vassar
campus
do
you
like
the
girl
here
yes
she
say
bring
me
up
short
to
the
possibility
that
my
criterion
be
suspect
i
thought
i
should
be
condescend
toward
nice
normal
people
and
only
like
the
brilliant
eccentric
it
take
me
a
long
time
to
stop
think
that
i
have
to
be
different
and
that
there
be
something
wrong
with
be
normal
or
average
and
to
get
to
the
point
of
enjoy
a
variety
of
people
for
what
they
be
i
can
t
say
i
think
mother
genuinely
love
us
toward
the
end
of
her
life
i
be
a
success
in
her
eye
and
perhaps
that
be
what
she
love
yet
with
all
her
complexity
i
felt
closer
throughout
my
early
childhood
to
my
mother
than
to
the
very
distant
and
rather
difficult
figure
of
my
father
i
like
him
but
always
from
a
distance
actually
he
delighted
in
child
and
be
rather
jolly
with
us
but
a
little
awkward
at
most
he
would
take
one
of
us
as
a
small
child
onto
his
lap
and
dangle
a
watch
at
our
ear
when
ruth
and
i
be
very
young
he
would
come
into
our
bedroom
before
breakfast
for
a
short
period
of
roughhouse
play
but
though
he
lack
the
gift
of
intimacy
in
many
way
his
supportive
love
still
come
through
to
me
he
somehow
conveyed
his
belief
in
me
without
ever
articulate
it
and
that
be
the
single
most
sustain
thing
in
my
life
that
be
what
save
me
i
realize
this
only
in
retrospect
however
since
our
relationship
take
time
to
grow
sensitive
subject
be
rarely
mention
at
our
house
but
three
be
particularly
taboo
money
my
father
s
be
jewish
and
sex
none
of
the
three
be
ever
articulate
by
any
of
us
in
the
family
in
fact
nothing
difficult
or
personal
be
discuss
among
us
there
be
such
an
aversion
to
talk
about
money
or
our
wealth
that
ironically
there
be
in
some
odd
way
a
fairly
spartan
quality
to
our
life
we
be
not
shower
with
conspicuous
possession
elaborate
toy
or
clothes
at
one
point
when
florence
be
eleven
my
mother
write
in
her
diary
that
she
have
gotten
flo
very
modest
present
for
her
birthday
book
praline
and
other
simple
thing
though
mother
felt
that
she
have
be
a
bit
mean
she
also
felt
that
it
be
the
best
way
to
continue
their
chance
for
happiness
to
restrain
the
desire
for
possession
i
have
less
than
most
of
the
girl
in
my
class
certainly
few
clothes
my
spare
wardrobe
in
grammar
school
consist
of
one
or
two
jumper
and
blouse
for
school
and
one
best
dress
we
be
also
treat
strictly
in
the
matter
of
allowance
i
still
remember
a
telegram
bi
sent
my
father
from
vassar
allowance
early
or
bust
he
wire
back
bust
the
only
discussion
i
do
remember
relate
to
wealth
have
to
do
with
be
told
that
you
couldn
t
just
be
a
rich
kid
that
you
have
to
do
something
to
be
engage
in
useful
productive
work
you
couldn
t
and
shouldn
t
do
nothing
work
be
always
a
part
of
my
life
i
remember
one
christmas
vacation
when
i
be
probably
about
fifteen
spent
at
the
federal
reserve
board
learn
to
draw
graph
my
mother
s
ambivalence
about
money
and
what
it
brought
to
her
no
doubt
contribute
to
her
own
unwillingness
to
talk
about
it
once
in
after
a
visit
to
a
utah
copper
mine
that
have
yield
my
father
great
financial
gain
she
write
in
her
diary
the
mine
be
an
interest
sight
but
the
village
that
lead
up
to
it
appalled
me
this
be
where
the
money
come
from
and
i
spend
it
on
chinese
art
but
it
be
a
shock
to
think
that
we
live
on
money
that
be
produce
under
such
condition
remarkably
the
fact
that
we
be
half
jewish
be
never
mention
any
more
than
money
be
discuss
i
be
totally
incredibly
unaware
of
anti
semitism
let
alone
of
my
father
s
be
jewish
i
don
t
think
this
be
deliberate
i
be
sure
my
parent
be
not
deny
or
hiding
my
father
s
jewishness
from
us
nor
be
they
ashamed
of
it
but
there
be
enough
sensitivity
so
that
it
be
never
explain
or
take
pride
in
indeed
we
have
a
pew
in
st
john
s
episcopal
church
the
president
s
church
on
lafayette
square
but
mainly
because
the
rector
be
a
friend
of
the
family
when
i
be
about
ten
all
of
us
meyer
child
be
baptize
at
home
to
satisfy
my
devout
lutheran
maternal
grandmother
who
thought
that
without
such
a
precaution
we
be
all
head
for
hell
but
for
the
most
part
religion
be
not
part
of
our
life
one
of
the
few
memory
i
have
of
any
reference
to
my
be
jewish
be
of
an
incident
that
take
place
when
i
be
ten
or
eleven
at
school
we
be
cast
for
reading
aloud
the
merchant
of
venice
and
one
classmate
suggest
i
should
be
shylock
because
i
be
jewish
in
the
same
way
i
have
once
innocently
ask
my
mother
whether
we
be
millionaire
after
someone
at
school
accuse
my
father
of
be
one
i
ask
if
i
be
jewish
and
what
that
meant
she
must
have
avoid
the
subject
because
i
don
t
remember
the
answer
this
confusion
about
religion
be
not
limited
to
me
my
sister
bi
recall
that
at
lunch
in
our
apartment
in
new
york
once
with
guest
present
she
blurt
out
say
who
be
this
guy
jesus
everyone
be
talk
about
my
identity
as
jewish
do
not
become
an
issue
until
i
reach
college
and
a
discussion
arose
with
a
girl
from
chicago
who
be
leave
vassar
she
have
be
ask
if
she
would
see
another
acquaintance
a
jewish
girl
also
from
chicago
oh
no
she
reply
you
can
t
have
a
jew
in
your
house
in
chicago
my
best
friend
connie
dimock
later
told
me
how
horrify
she
be
to
have
this
say
in
front
of
me
only
then
do
i
get
it
and
this
be
with
hitler
already
a
factor
in
the
world
about
the
third
thing
that
be
never
discuss
in
our
family
sex
i
knew
nothing
for
a
surprisingly
long
time
i
have
no
idea
what
sex
be
or
how
baby
be
conceive
in
fact
it
be
as
if
our
rigorous
schedule
and
exercise
and
athletic
program
be
construct
to
keep
us
from
think
too
much
about
it
i
once
ask
my
mother
what
really
happen
during
sex
tell
her
i
d
read
about
the
sperm
and
the
ovum
but
wonder
how
it
all
work
she
respond
haven
t
you
see
dog
in
the
street
although
unfortunately
i
hadn
t
i
naturally
say
of
course
and
that
be
the
end
of
the
conversation
mother
finally
brought
herself
to
speak
to
me
about
have
period
or
become
a
woman
don
t
worry
about
it
mother
i
reply
it
happen
month
ago
because
these
matter
be
never
discuss
i
be
almost
totally
unaware
of
all
of
them
money
religion
and
sex
it
s
peculiar
i
realize
of
course
that
the
house
be
big
and
that
we
have
a
lot
of
servant
but
i
didn
t
know
we
be
rich
any
more
than
i
knew
we
be
jewish
in
some
way
it
be
quite
bizarre
in
others
quite
healthy
equally
odd
be
how
little
we
be
taught
about
the
practical
aspect
of
life
i
didn
t
know
how
to
manage
the
simplest
task
i
didn
t
know
how
to
dress
sew
cook
shop
and
rather
more
important
relate
to
people
of
any
kind
let
alone
young
men
my
governess
and
i
do
some
minor
shopping
but
as
i
grow
up
i
mostly
inherit
party
dress
from
my
sister
until
when
i
be
eighteen
mother
take
me
to
bergdorf
goodman
for
french
clothes
of
stagger
beauty
and
sophistication
which
be
well
beyond
my
year
and
whose
quality
be
waste
on
young
people
who
dress
appropriately
there
be
nothing
in
between
for
everyday
i
be
always
well
fed
and
care
for
of
course
in
fact
my
mother
be
constantly
remind
us
of
how
lucky
we
be
how
much
we
owe
our
parent
how
far
see
and
wonderful
my
father
be
to
have
take
care
of
us
all
and
we
be
indeed
lucky
we
have
vast
privilege
we
have
parent
with
solid
value
our
interest
be
arouse
in
art
and
politics
and
book
but
to
all
of
this
i
brought
my
own
feeling
of
inability
and
inferiority
not
only
to
my
mother
but
to
my
old
sister
and
brother
i
be
i
thought
realistic
about
my
own
asset
and
ability
as
i
grow
old
i
be
not
very
pretty
i
grow
tall
early
and
therefore
seem
ungainly
to
myself
i
didn
t
think
i
could
excel
and
be
sure
i
d
never
attract
a
man
whom
i
would
like
and
who
would
not
be
view
with
condescension
by
my
parent
and
sibling
in
all
the
turmoil
of
the
family
and
our
strange
isolation
both
from
our
parent
and
from
the
outside
world
we
child
be
left
to
bring
ourselves
up
emotionally
and
intellectually
we
be
lead
life
fraught
with
ambivalence
it
be
hard
to
have
an
identity
an
early
example
of
this
come
one
day
when
the
telephone
rang
in
the
playroom
and
there
be
no
grown
up
present
bi
very
fearfully
picked
up
the
phone
and
say
hello
a
male
voice
impatiently
ask
who
be
this
who
be
this
to
which
bi
reply
this
be
the
little
girl
that
mademoiselle
take
care
of
that
be
the
only
way
she
could
think
of
to
describe
herself
to
a
strange
grown
up
so
the
question
of
who
we
really
be
and
what
our
aspiration
be
intellectual
or
social
be
always
disquiet
the
more
subtle
inheritance
of
my
strange
childhood
be
the
feel
which
we
all
share
to
some
extent
of
believe
we
be
never
quite
go
about
thing
correctly
have
i
say
the
right
thing
have
i
worn
the
right
clothes
be
i
attractive
these
question
be
unsettle
and
self
absorb
even
overwhelm
at
time
and
remain
so
throughout
much
of
my
adult
life
until
at
last
i
grow
impatient
with
dwell
on
the
past
chapter
three
in
june
of
my
father
bought
the
washington
post

of
us
could
have
know
then
what
a
transform
event

would
be
in
all
our
life
the
paper

fall
on

and
own
and
wore
the
famous
hope
diamond
which
be
repute
to
bring
bad
luck
to
its
owner
and
seem
to
have
do
so
for
her
she
have
every
intention
of
save
the
post
for
her
son
and
so
have
turn
down
several
offer
to
buy
it
or
urge
her
husband
to
do
so
include
at
least
one
from
my
father
in
fact
my
father
have
several
time
before
express
interest
in
the
post
and
other
paper
as
early
as
when
he
realize
that
hearst
have
two
paper
in
washington
both
loser
he
thought
hearst
might
be
willing
to
sell
one
and
try
to
acquire
the
morning
washington
herald
four
year
later
in
he
try
to
buy
the
post
for
million
certain
that
this
price
be
so
high
that
the
american
security
trust
company
which
control
the
paper
then
couldn
t
possibly
afford
to
turn
him
down
but
it
do
other
offer
for
the
post
include
two
in
each
for
million
be
also
reject
this
be
because
evalyn
mclean
held
on
despite
divorce
proceeding
and
court
fight
so
the
profitable
paper
ned
have
inherit
from
his
father
continued
its
downhill
slide
poorly
manage
with
at
least
a
half
million
dollar
in
debt
it
be
force
into
receivership
in
march
unable
even
to
pay
its
newsprint
bill
and
be
to
be
sell
at
public
auction
meanwhile
in
september
my
father
have
be
appoint
by
hoover
to
be
governor
of
the
federal
reserve
board
what
he
undertook
in
this
job
be
nothing
less
than
an
attempt
to
turn
around
the
depression
he
guide
the
banking
and
monetary
policy
of
the
united
state
domestically
and
abroad
he
conceptualize
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
write
the
legislation
to
set
it
up
shepherd
the
bill
through
the
congress
and
serve
as
chairman
of
the
new
credit
agency
his
name
be
specifically
write
into
the
legislation
as
chairman
so
that
the
bill
would
be
sure
to
pas
as
well
as
keep
his
responsibility
as
governor
of
the
federal
reserve
but
the
strain
of
run
one
institution
in
the
morning
and
another
in
the
afternoon
and
both
during
the
bad
of
the
depression
be
too
great
and
he
nearly
broke
under
the
pressure
my
mother
go
to
see
president
hoover
to
say
that
these
intolerable
professional
burden
could
not
continue
and
that
the
president
would
have
to
relieve
my
father
of
some
of
his
duty
before
he
have
a
complete
breakdown
in
her
diary
she
give
a
graphic
description
of
her
visit
to
the
president
yesterday
be
eugene
s
low
water
mark
in
physical
fatigue
he
be
so
much
harass
by
white
house
pound
that
i
make
a
secret
appointment
with
hoover
and
frighten
him
thoroughly
by
tell
him
e
would
break
physically
unless
he
h
help
protect
him
from
senatorial
greed
the
plan
work
and
i
be
sure
h
will
move
carefully
from
now
on
in
his
whole
attitude
toward
e
without
accuse
h
of
anything
i
force
him
at
least
temporarily
into
the
position
of
ally
which
he
never
can
be
permanently
because
of
his
unfortunate
disposition
which
sacrifice
everybody
and
everything
to
what
momentarily
seem
advantageous
to
his
own
position
and
objective
during
my
conversation
with
the
pres
i
be
surprised
after
hearing
only
e
s
version
of
their
ever
stormy
relationship
to
have
him
begin
by
say
emphatically
eugene
meyer
be
the
most
valuable
man
i
ve
get
my
chief
occupation
be
to
keep
e
well
in
the
end
what
help
relieve
the
pressure
a
little
be
congressional
passage
of
the
emergency
relief
and
construction
act
of
which
separate
the
two
job
of
the
federal
reserve
and
the
rfc
and
allow
my
father
to
give
up
the
latter
the
election
of
franklin
roosevelt
in
the
fall
of
of
course
create
a
different
problem
for
my
father
a
hoover
appointee
he
felt
that
what
he
have
attempt
be
for
the
public
good
so
he
saw
no
point
in
resign
even
though
hoover
want
him
to
my
mother
s
interpretation
of
hoover
s
repeatedly
urge
my
father
to
resign
before
roosevelt
s
inauguration
be
typically
to
the
point
perhaps
like
an
oriental
widow
he
be
expect
to
hurl
himself
upon
his
master
s
funeral
pyre
i
think
h
hoover
would
like
to
go
down
to
his
political
grave
with
all
his
retainer
household
and
even
the
pet
dog
bury
with
him
like
the
iranian
or
scythian
chief
my
father
may
have
felt
similarly
but
he
have
no
intention
of
make
his
job
as
governor
of
the
federal
reserve
look
like
a
political
position
which
he
felt
it
be
not
meant
to
be
nor
should
be
on
the
other
hand
he
didn
t
see
any
sense
in
remain
in
the
government
since
he
felt
he
be
tilt
at
windmill
when
roosevelt
ask
him
to
stay
as
head
of
the
federal
reserve
he
agree
to
do
so
but
in
late
march
he
sent
fdr
his
letter
of
resignation
in
his
eye
roosevelt
s
sin
be
many
but
a
few
stood
out
his
experimentation
with
the
dollar
his
disregard
for
the
gold
standard
and
his
general
lack
of
sophistication
about
economic
and
financial
policy
a
lack
share
i
must
say
by
every
other
president
so
the
bankruptcy
of
the
post
come
at
a
propitious
time
for
my
father
just
as
he
be
leave
the
government
he
and
my
mother
have
clearly
discuss
the
possibility
of
buying
the
paper
since
she
write
in
her
diary
on
may
nearly
a
month
before
the
purchase
and
the
day
before
my
father
s
resignation
from
the
federal
reserve
board
be
accepted
by
fdr
he
eugene
have
suddenly
decide
to
buy
t
p
if
he
succeed
it
will
be
a
sensation
and
we
shall
have
a
reputation
for
machiavellian
behavior
i
be
reluctant
at
first
because
it
mean
more
hard
work
at
once
but
after
all
these
be
not
time
in
which
to
loiter
also
it
mean
a
heavy
expenditure
but
what
after
all
be
money
for
if
not
to
be
use
yet
sometime
after
this
diary
entry
my
father
have
still
not
decide
to
make
the
purchase
instead
the
first
thing
he
do
be
retire
to
mount
kisco
the
story
go
that
after
his
second
week
of
retirement
he
come
down
the
stair
trail
his
finger
on
the
banister
and
claim
to
find
dust
he
murmur
something
about
the
house
s
not
be
properly
run
to
which
my
mother
respond
eugene
it
s
time
you
bought
the
post
he
himself
explain
what
happen
to
a
group
from
the
american
society
of
newspaper
editor
in
like
the
oriental
philosopher
of
olden
day
i
be
determine
to
leave
a
chaotic
world
in
order
to
enjoy
the
peace
and
seclusion
of
an
agricultural
existence
this
benign
mood
last
just
two
week
when
i
decide
and
i
be
afraid
my
family
also
decide
that
the
contemplative
life
be
not
for
me
ironically
he
be
prompt
to
reconsider
the
post
by
a
visit
to
mount
kisco
from
cissy

his
interest
this
time
it
held
and
he
come
down

to
me
about
the

of
the

especially
give
its
importance
to
my
future
life
and
that
of
my

be
that
i
knew
nothing
about
it
no
one
in
my
family
have
mention
it
to
me
either
before
or
even
immediately
after
nor
be
they
aware
they
hadn
t
told
me
about
it
at
the
time
of
the
auction
i
have
just
finish
my
junior
year
at

also
a

some

i
naturally
curious
because
of
her

interest
in
journalism
and
my
father
s
year
of
public
service
discuss
the

speculate
on
the
anonymous
purchaser
of
the
paper
when
i
finish
my
college
board
i
go
home

mention
something
to
my
father
about
when
you
take
over
the
post
and
so
remote
in
my
mind
be
the
possibility
that
he
might
have
be
the
anonymous
buyer
that
i
ask
in
all
innocence
what
she

do
shortly
after

discover
the
secret
purchase
it
be

that

of
the

a
few
fine
people
who

and
some
others
who

nowhere

to
the
announcement

favorable
privately
however
there
be
doubt
which
linger
on
for
year
both
about
the
possibility
of
the
post
s
be
a
nonpartisan
paper
and
about
whether
the
number
five
paper
in
town
run
by
an
inexperienced
publisher
would
ever
make
it
on
the
latter
point
gardner
cowles
one
of
the
most
able
independent
publisher
in
the
country
warn
my
father
that
washington
be
an
afternoon
newspaper
town
with
the
government
worker
get
to
their
job
early
and
home
by
four
thirty
he
say
no
morning
paper
especially
the
post
would
ever
amount
to
anything
the
star
have
the
town
by
the
throat
to
cowles
my
father
rather
piously
respond
the
capital
of
this
great
nation
deserves
a
good
paper
i
believe
in
the
american
people
they
can
be
rely
on
to
do
the
right
thing
when
they
know
the
fact
i
be
go
to
give
them
the
unbiased
truth
when
an
idea
be
right
nothing
can
stop
it
as
to
whether
the
paper
would
or
could
be
nonpartisan
with
a
republican
owner
like
eugene
meyer
my
father
emphasize
from
the
start
that
the
post
would
be
independent
even
in
the
announcement
about
his
ownership
there
be
several
key
statement
that
prove
to
be
the
underpinnings
of
eugene
meyer
s
post
it
be
his
aim
to
improve
the
paper
and
he
would
do
so
by
make
it
an
independent
voice
he
explain
that
in
purchasing
the
post
he
have
act
in
his
own
behalf
and
without
persuasion
from
any
person
group
or
organization
although
many
people
do
not
quite
believe
this
at
the
time
it
be
true
and
he
be
try
to
assure
the
public
that
the
post
would
not
be
a
toy
it
would
not
be
the
voice
of
the
republican
party
and
it
would
not
be
use
to
fight
franklin
roosevelt
although
it
later
do
to
some
extent
from
the
begin
my
father
be
excite
the
challenge
seem
to
have
rejuvenate
him
morale
at
the
paper
improve
immediately
after
he
reverse
the
percent
pay
cut
that
have
be
impose
by
the
receiver
and
told
the
employee
they
could
all
keep
their
job
if
they
just
make
good
then
he
look
around
and
very
quickly
begin
to
face
the
stark
reality
of
the
wreck
he
have
acquire
a
paper
with
a
reduce
number
of
page
that
have
lose
most
of
its
good
people
a
paper
with
drastically
diminish
circulation
and
advertising
and
one
that
have
be
operating
without
know
whether
the
press
would
run
the
next
day
on
the
very
day
he
be
announce
as
the
owner
the
paper
be
only
eighteen
page
with
a
total
of
nineteen
column
of
display
ad
and
less
than
two
page
of
classify
ad
as
my
father
say
it
be
a
paper
that
be
mentally
morally
physically
and
in
every
other
way
bankrupt
at
the
outset
in
attempt
to
reorganize
the
paper
he
have
rather
na
vely
felt
that
since
he
have
be
a
success
at
business
and
government
he
could
apply
what
he
have
learn
to
the
realm
of
journalism
though
he
didn
t
understand
newspaper
he
thought
he
could
turn
this
one
around
simply
by
invest
heavily
and
run
it
well
instead
there
follow
year
of
struggle
and
discouragement
and
investment
with
only
minimal
success
he
learn
some
expensive
lesson
the
go
in
price
be
just
the
begin
of
the
financial
drain
and
mental
strain
that
go
on
for
most
of
the
next
twenty
year
and
there
be
many
moment
during
these
year
of
uphill
battle
when
he
have
his
doubt
about
whether
he
could
ever
succeed
he
would
moan
to
us
and
even
talk
about
sell
it
although
never
i
think
seriously
one
of
those
moment
and
one
of
his
roughest
experience

twenty
two
month
after
the
end

the
lawsuit
she
get

comic
anyway
when
the
contract
for
the
post
finally
expire
she
and
my
father
didn
t
speak
again
for
year
except
once
when
they
be
both
ask
to
dinner
by
mr
sumner
welles
the
wife
of
the
undersecretary
of
state
a
lady
unconscious
of
strain
in
relationship
my
friend
luvie
pearson
who
be
there
later
told
me
that
they
sat
down
together
and
talk
most
of
the
night
all
the
while
the
intense
fight
over
the
comic
be
go
on
my
father
be
hard
at
work
try
to
improve
the
paper
and
to
make
it
financially
solvent
he
soon
realize
that
the
newspaper
business
be
like
no
other
business
he
knew
you
couldn
t
use
ordinary
technique
for
improve
a
business
and
then
look
for
result
he
have
very
little
idea
of
what
could
be
do
to
make
the
paper
a
financial
success
particularly
since
there
be
so
many
paper
in
washington
what
he
do
have
be
a
well
developed
philosophy
which
he
spell
out
in
an
early
editorial
in
and
in
several
speech
over
the
next
few
year
he
felt
a
newspaper
be
a
public
trust
meant
to
serve
the
public
in
a
democracy
my
father
want
a
paper
that
would
advance
beyond
what
it
have
achieve
even
in
its
heyday
and
take
a
leadership
which
could
be
achieve
only
by
exceptional
quality
in
one
address
on
march
he
spoke
about
the
principle
that
he
insist
on
from
the
begin
outline
them
as
follow
that
the
first
mission
of
a
newspaper
be
to
tell
the
truth
as
nearly
as
the
truth
may
be
ascertain
that
the
newspaper
shall
tell
all
the
truth
so
far
as
it
can
learn
it
concern
the
important
affair
of
america
and
the
world
that
as
a
disseminator
of
news
the
paper
shall
observe
the
decency
that
be
obligatory
upon
a
private
gentleman
that
what
it
print
shall
be
fit
reading
for
the
young
as
well
as
for
the
old
that
the
newspaper
s
duty
be
to
its
reader
and
to
the
public
at
large
and
not
to
the
private
interest
of
its
owner
that
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
the
newspaper
shall
be
prepared
to
make
sacrifice
of
its
material
fortune
if
such
course
be
necessary
for
the
public
good
that
the
newspaper
shall
not
be
the
ally
of
any
special
interest
but
shall
be
fair
and
free
and
wholesome
in
its
outlook
on
public
affair
and
public
men
these
principle
be
the
heart
and
soul
of
his
conviction
but
how
to
translate
them
into
action
be
the
challenge
the
first
thing
he
work
on
be
the
people
need
to
undertake
the
daunt
task
of
turn
the
paper
around
to
begin
with
he
didn
t
know
who
the
good
people
be
or
how
to
find
them
when
he
do
find
good
people
some
newsman
he
d
heard
about
or
others
he
have
scout
out
it
be
almost
impossible
to
persuade
them
to
come
to
work
for
what
look
like
a
fail
newspaper
in
addition
the
professional
continued
to
be
unsure
about
my
father
s
motif
his
statement
to
the
contrary
many
go
on
believe
that
he
be
there
to
run
a
republican
paper
or
at
least
use
the
post
to
set
right
the
roosevelt
administration
my
father
always
claimed
that
the
compete
paper
in
washington
kept
circulate
rumor
that
add
to
the
uncertainty
and
difficulty
of
acquire
a
first
class
staff
the
search
be
on
for
staff
people
for
the
editorial
and
news
side
of
the
paper
as
well
as
for
the
business
side

of
uneven
quality

brought
in
for

at
the

although
maclean
be
a
superior
reporter
he
do
nothing
to
build
up
good
people
in
the

he
saw
him
as
lazy
a
drunkard
and
a
womanizer
i
myself
be
quite
surprised
during
one
of
maclean

when
during
the
course
of

i
told
nobody

and
who
eventually

him
bring
order
to
the
chaotic
business
side
editorially
too
the
dark
precede
the

in

together

spree
in
some
case
pay
high
salary
out
of
line
with
the
time
and
brought
on
many
people
who
become
important
to
the
future
of
the
paper
recognize
the
significance
of
a
paper
in
the
nation
s
capital
they
begin
to
assemble
a
separate
staff
of
national
news
writer
to
give
full
coverage
to
government
news
particularly
the
affair
of
the
federal
government
from
the
begin
my
father
also
have
see
the
importance
of
the
local
aspect
of
the
paper
particularly
in
light
of
the
strange
way
in
which
the
city
be
govern
in
sport
my
father
have
the
benefit
of
a
holdover
from
the
old
mclean
regime

than
seventy
year
povich
still
go
into
the

frequently
and
occasionally
writes
for
the
paper
povich
later
told
the
story
of
another
area
like
the
comic
about
which
my
father
be
an
innocent
in
when
the
senator
the
local
baseball
team
be
finish
a
disastrous
seventh
in
the
american
league
my
father
think
the
team
be
suppose
to
win
the
pennant
every
year
as
they
have
in
ask
him
what
be
wrong
with
the
ball
club
pitch
no
pitch
mr
meyer
povich
told
him
tell
me
maybe
it
would
be
good
for
the
washington
post
how
much
do
it
cost
to
buy
a
pitcher
my
father
innocently
inquire
he
have
already
grown
to
realize
the
importance
of
sport
to
newspaper
readership
in
those
day
the
people
in
washington
often
found
out
what
be
happen
at
the
ballpark
by
watch
the
big
scoreboard
in
front
of
the
post
s
e
street
building
where
the
score
be
post
in

occasionally
my
father
himself
carry
the
score
from
the
telegraph
man
to
the
man
at
the
scoreboard
once
when
goose
goslin
hit
a
home
run
to
win
a
big
game
he
ask
that
the
score
not
be
post
until
he
could
get
there
and
see
the
pleasure
of
the
large
crowd
that
always
gather
to
watch
understand
the
limit
of
syndicate
material
and
the
extent
to
which
it
cause
newspaper
to
lose
their
individual
character
my
father
be
determine
that
the
post
attempt
to
be
as
original
as
it
could
one
area
he
focus
on
be
the
woman
s
page
building
them
up
under
a
highly
intelligent
editor
malvina
lindsay
who
also
write
a
column
the
gentler
sex
he
thought
the
post
s
material
for
woman
be
dreary
and
begin
to
create
a
staff
of
writer
as
he
say
who
would
write
for
washington
woman
among
washington
woman
and
about
the
interest
of
washington
woman
even
within
a
year
of
his
purchase
of
the
paper
he
consider
this
revitalization
of
the
woman
s
page
to
be
one
of
the
post
s
most
successful
accomplishment
unusually
for
the
time
he
hire
woman
for
those
page
and
give
them
prominent
role
on
the
paper
his
interest
in
psychiatry
and
mental
health
lead
him
to
look
for
a
psychiatrist
to
write
an
advice
column
for
people
with
problem
when
he
couldn
t
lure
a
psychiatrist
to
the
task
he
select
elizabeth
young
a
staff
reporter
on
the
woman
s
page
to
write
it
and
have
her
work
overseen
by
a
psychiatrist
for
the
first
few
month
young
who
write
under
the
name
mary
haworth
be
so
capable
that
her
column
become
one
of
the
most
popular
feature
on
the
paper
receive
more
than
twenty
thousand
letter
a
year
seek
advice
it
s
hard
to
convey
how
groundbreaking
and
successful
this
column
be
but
it
be
eventually
syndicate
and
read
by
twenty
million
people
another
successful
initiative
of
his
be
introduce
the
publication
of
reader
opinion
poll
dr
george
gallup
be
just
start
his
american
institute
of
public
opinion
and
his
poll
weren
t
take
very
seriously
ever
the
logical
thinker
and
have
always
put
a
premium
on
the
importance
of
research
my
father
sign
the
first
contract
with
gallup
and
ran
his
poll
on
the
front
page
most
important
what
he
work
on
from
the
very
start
of
his
ownership
be
develop
the
editorial
page
he
believe
that
the
editorial
page
as
a
force
in
american
life
have
dwindle
in
power
and
prestige
and
felt
that
a
rejuvenate
page
on
the
post
would
make
the
paper
that
a
good
editorial
page
be
more
important
in
the
nation
s
capital
than
anywhere
else
in
the
country
he
try
always
to
instill
in
the
editor
the
importance
of
avoid
emotional
vindictive
or
partisan
voice
and
he
vowed
never
to
subscribe
blindly
to
a
government
policy
simply
because
it
be
a
government
policy
not
to
submit
to
domination
by
officialdom
and
to
avoid
the
subtle
influence
of
mob
psychology
he
have
his
own
philosophy
in
place
but
the
challenge
be
to
find
a
really
distinguish
editorial
page
editor
one
who
share
his
ideal
and
his
aspiration
after
make
several
effort
to
hire
high
profile
writer
from
other
paper
he
begin
to
look
for
a
vigorous
unlabeled
young
man
and
settle
on
felix
morley
who
arrive
at
the

be
very
bright
literate
and
a
quaker

my

a
tradition
carry
on
to
this
day
by
the
publisher
of
the
post
by
make
an
arrangement
with
morley
that
he
would
never
be
ask
to
write
something
with
which
he
disagreed
the
two
men
agree
that
in
case
of
a
showdown
the
publisher
reserve
the
right
to
have
his
view
prevail
and
their
relationship
evolve
into
a
collegial
one
and
remain
so
until
their
strong
disagreement
prior
to

war
ii
when
morley
s
pacifist
view
make
him
more
of
an

important
thing

despite

s
desire
that
the

be
independent
and
objective
someone
remark
that
the
front
page
at
first
read
like
a
federal

board
bulletin
it
seem
that
many
of
the
editor
and
reporter
be
aim
to
please
by
give
him
what
they
thought
he
want
indeed
in
the
very
early
period
of
my
father
s
publishership
the
staff
persist
in
focus
on
story
about
finance
banking
and
taxation
they
soon
discover
he
be
quite
serious
about
the
independence
of
the
paper
and
the
autonomy
of
its
reporter
and
editor
within
the
limit
of
his
principle
he
work
out
a
system
that
endure

on
both
side
editorial
and
business
provide

five
post
publisher
my
father
phil
graham
and
myself
come
to
work
inexperienced
in
different
way
this
be
the
only
practical
way
to
run
thing
anyway
but
i
still
believe
it
s
the
best
way
for
newspaper
to
be
run
editorially
in
alone
my
father
lose
more
than
million
from
that
year
on
he
make
the
post
a
partnership
with
my
mother
with
any
profit
and
loss
to
be
divide
between
the
two

despite
the

partially
tax
deductible
real
progress
have
be
make
but
the
progress
be
more
in
news
than
in
advertising
and
circulation
his
quest
for
integrity
clearly
extend
to
the
business
side
he
want
to
be
sure
the
advertising
sale
people
would
study
the
need
of
advertiser
and
honestly
try
to
fulfill
them
the
story
of
the
post
s
editorial
transformation

to
be

to

advertiser
and
my
father
be
deeply
involve
in
that
sale
effort
but
real
circulation
success
continued
to
elude
him
until
over
a
decade
later
after
the
war
by
my
father
have
begin
to
understand
what
the
newspaper
business
be
all
about
gradually
an
organization

put
in
place

in

year
and
the
extent

her
care

in

for

an

people
living
there
be
that

i
work
for
the
post
as
early
as
the
summer
of
between
high
school
and
college
i
be
mainly
a
copy
girl
or
messenger
in
the
woman
s
department
but
i
become
friend
with
those
two
fine
newswoman
malvina
lindsay
and
mary
haworth
from
then
on
i
have
occasional
summer
job
at
the
post
when
i
go
to
college
a
year
after
the
purchase
my
parent
and
i
correspond
constantly
about
what
be
happen
i
read
the
post
daily
comment
encourage
and
even
criticize
while
my
parent
particularly
my
father
told
me
in
great
detail
about
what
be
go
on
i
found
myself
deeply
involve
with
the
struggle
to
improve
the
paper
somewhat
to
my
surprise
give
that
i
thought
of
myself
during
this
period
as
unsophisticated
unworldly
and
fairly
unopinionated
i
seem
to
have
be
full
of
independent
appraisal
of
the
paper
and
what
it
be
printing
for
instance
at
the
age
of
seventeen
i
write
my
parent
have
be
reading
the
post
faithfully
i
think
it
really
be
get
very
good
the
human
interest
that
be
jammed
down
its
throat
at
first
and
look
so
awkward
seem
to
be
get
underneath
the
news
now
i
find
myself
unconsciously
pick
it
up
before
my
new
york
paper
i
think
you
slip
up
once
when
you
put
the
over
pathetic
community
chest
advertisement
depict
the
child
on
the
street
opposite
the
page
show
society
at
a
dance
it
might
have
make
people
give
or
it
might
have
be
unintentional
but
the
effect
be
rather
startle
especially
i
should
think
to
the
unemployed
however
that
be
a
minor
detail
i
should
think
you
would
be
encourage
as
a
whole
much
later
the
depth
of
my
care
be
point
out
to
me
by
phil
s
psychiatrist
who
told
me
that
phil
and
i
both
have
a
problem
we
care
too
much
about
the
post
i
told
him
in
one
of
the
great
understatement
of
my
life
that
i
fear
there
be
little

could
do
about
that
chapter
four
in
the
fall
of

left

and
robert
the
other
butler
have
just
have
his
appendix
out
but
i
just
ignore
difficulty
and
we
come
through
with
the
meyer
social
color
fly
high
than
ever
while
my
old
sister
and
brother
be
thus
venture
into
the
real
world
i
be
so
unworldly
that
it
be
difficult
for
me
to
function
my
new
circle
of
friend
and
range
of
activity
all
look
appropriate
and
right
but
i
found
them
confuse
and
felt
lose
i
have
a
particularly
hard
time
concentrate
on
my
work
and
reading
my
mind
constantly
wander
to
where
i
be
go
and
what
i
be
do
to
the
problem
of
how
not
to
be
lonely
in
addition
i
be
cop
with
difficulty
stem
from
my
protect
and
wait
on
background
which
i
have
always
take
for
grant
not
be
very
conscious
of
fashion
i
have
only
the
few
elegant
make
to
order
dress
chosen
by
my
mother
and
nothing
for
everyday
before
college
begin
i
have
set
forth
to
buy
clothes
with
no
idea
where
to
go
or
what
i
would
need
and
i
somehow
outfit
myself
with
skirt
and
sweater
but
i
wore
one
yellow
cardigan
through
the
first
week
of
school
until
thanksgiving
when
someone
finally
suggest
it
should
be
wash
i
have
notice
girl
sweater
stretch
out
on
towel
but
have
no
idea
either
that
i
should
be
follow
their
example
or
even
how
to
at
home
someone
have
always
remove
dirty
and
discard
clothes
which
later
reappear
in
my
drawer
i
resolve
that
problem
by
send
the
yellow
sweater
out
to
a
cleaner
and
never
do
learn
how
to
wash
one
this
ignorance
of
practical
matter
apply
to
every
aspect
of
daily
life
whether
it
be
cooking
or
cleaning
or
decorate
or
buying
my
clothes
or
know
how
much
i
could
spend
or
how
much
others
spent
i
have
to
learn
from
life
from
bumping
up
against
reality
or
from
my
friend
even
so
i
muddle
through
and
learn
a
great
deal
my
freshman
year
in
particular
i
become
aware
of
the
issue
surround
the
roosevelt
administration
the
new
deal
become
a
reality
for
the
first
time
and
i
begin
to
be
interested
in
it
in
a
less
than
abstract
way
the
atmosphere
at
home
be
so
anti
roosevelt
dad
in
a
rational
measure
way
mother
more
emotionally
that
i
have
never
really
heard
a
pro
new
deal
position
between
the
professor
the
radical
girl
on
the
vassar
newspaper
which
i
go
out
for
and
a
new
good
friend
connie
dimock
who
gradually
turn
extremely
left
wing
i
become
convert
to
the
goal
of
the
new
deal
in
fact
the
three
middle
meyer
child
all
become
new
dealer
our
view
result
in
wild
and
vociferous
political
argument
with
both
parent
but
mostly
my
mother
perhaps
because
of
my
conservative
temperament
i
slowly
developed
idea
that
have
remain
fairly
consistent
throughout
my
life
with
variation
now
and
then
i
believe
and
believe
that
capitalism
work
best
for
a
freedom
love
society
that
it
brings
more
prosperity
to
more
people
than
any
other
social
economic
system
but
that
somehow
we
have
to
take
care
of
people
these
idea
convert
me
into
an
ardent
roosevelt
advocate
at
that
time
and
for
all
three
of
his
reelection
campaign
i
be
take
freshman
german
and
become
a
great
devotee
of
thomas
mann
particularly
of
his
novella
tonio
kr
ger
in
it
mann
talk
about
the
ambivalence
and
conflict
within
tonio
cause
by
the
natural
rift
between
his
prussian
father
and
his
warm
blood
emotional
south
german
mother
the
splinter
cause
by
the
pull
of
these
two
opposite
make
him
feel
different
from
others
and
he
longs
to
be
like
everyone
else
that
may
or
may
not
be
an
accurate
reading
of
this
lovely
story
but
that
s
how
it
struck
me
i
be
so
carry
away
and
personally
involve
with
the
theme
that
i
picked
up
an
english
translation
and
galloped
through
it
unwilling
and
unable
to
struggle
with
my
begin
german
so
i
be
learn
but
my
work
be
spotty
and
disorganize
i
have
come
to
college
unprepared
lack
the
kind
of
self
discipline
need
to
read
with
concentration
and
the
skill
necessary
to
assemble
research
give
it
thought
and
write
an
essay
a
history
paper
i
have
be
assign
to
write
by
an
unsympathetic
and
tough
professor
lucy
textor
be
a
case
in
point
i
write
my
parent
about
our
conflict
be
still
disagree
violently
with
my
history
teacher
right
now
perhaps
my
idea
be
too
general
but
i
think
hers
be
too
specific
i
e
she
have
taught
history
ten
year
too
long
we
have
a
long
topic
to
write
just
now
on
anything
we
wish
to
i
chose
the
position
of
woman
in
the
middle
age
trace
the
similar
custom
by
race
from
the
saxon
in
germany
to
england
and
bring
out
the
difference
in
italy
france
germany
and
england
as
they
have
just
begin
to
obtain
right
it
seem
interest
to
me
to
do
this
for
this
period
and
perhaps
again
at
later
period
when
we
study
them
i
realize
what
a
tremendous
job
this
be
but
she
want
me
to
take
one
woman
and
do
her
if
i
take
one
woman
she
would
have
to
be
famous
therefore
she
would
be
an
exception
which
be
not
what
i
be
after
i
be
go
to
try
my
topic
despite
what
she
say
even
if
it
doesn
t
make
a
good
one
i
will
get
what
i
want
out
of
it
all
of
this
will
probably
result
in
a
bad
mark
because
we
dislike
each
other
i
do
my
history
my
own
way
and
enjoy
it
the
innocence
and
arrogance
of
youth
be
evident
here
as
well
as
a
budding
interest
in
the
position
of
woman
the
hat
miss
textor
and
i
come
to
grief
over
the
ill
prepared
paper
she
suspect
i
suppose
what
be
really
the
case
which
be
that
i
have
do
only
a
half
bake
job
and
say
so
miss
meyer
read
us
your
paper
when
i
finish
reading
it
she
say
that
s
a
good
introduction
then
what
well
it
be
the
end
of
what
i
have
do
she
give
me
a
d
which
result
in
my
be
put
on
probation
an
embarrass
failure
that
i
resent
even
while
i
recognize
it
as
at
least
partly
deserve
instead
of
be
outrage
at
me
my
mother
be
outrage
at
the
college
she
write
from
miami
beach
that
she
have
raise
an
awful
row
with
mccracken
then
president
of
vassar
because
they
sent
me
notice
you
be
on
history
pro
dr
mccracken
assure
me
this
mark
would
not
stand
against
you
and
you
may
be
sure
it
won
t
in
the
meantime
please
work
as
never
before
and
don
t
say
a
word
about
my
fusillade
against
this
female
i
sent
my
letter
to
dean
thompson
i
be
furious
that
they
dare
send
me
a
report
of
your
be
on
history
pro
and
shall
shatter
the
quiet
of
vassar
if
they
don
t
change
thing
pdq
i
be
embarrass
though
somewhat
relieve
when
i
get
her
letter
but
mostly
i
be
worried
that
her
scathing
tirade
to
the
dean
and
the
president
would
create
pressure
on
me
to
follow
up
with
the
good
and
write
a
first
rate
paper
in
the
end
i
work
off
the
probation
and
pass
the
course
midway
through
my
freshman
year
i
begin
to
feel
well
about
my
schoolwork
and
also
to
feel
that
college
be
grow
more
interest
and
alive
but
i
have
some
difficulty
with
the
fact
that
my
mother
it
seem
could
outdo
my
every
achievement
throughout
my
year
of
college
it
always
turn
out
that
she
have
read
all
the
book
assign
to
me
read
them
assimilate
them
critique
them
dismiss
them
even
commit
them
to
memory
in
a
letter
to
my
father
in
the
spring
of
my
freshman
year
i
write
that
i
be
reading
tolstoy
on
the
function
of
art
and
found
that
he
agrees
with
mother
in
most
of
his
idea
how
odd
that
i
should
have
put
it
this
way
and
not
the
other
way
around
what
assuage
my
spirit
be
that
by
this
time
connie
and
i
have
become
seriously
interested
in
politics
we
be
oppose
to
a
bill
in
the
new
york
state
senate
provide
that
every
member
of
state
support
institution
meaning
college
too
because
they
be
tax
exempt
swear
allegiance
to
the
constitution
hearst
be
a
big
proponent
of
this
measure
and
be
back
by
the
american
legion
i
write
my
father
i
hear
dad
that
you
disagree
with
me
on
this
subject
this
be
not
a
bit
of
college
communism
however
i
think
it
be
absurd
you
can
t
brush
out
communism
by
refuse
to
recognize
it
i
be
appoint
treasurer
of
the
college
political
club
and
be
about
to
refuse
fear
it
be
the
road
to
become
president
of
the
oshkosh
woman
s
club
but
then
as
i
write
my
parent
on
the
other
hand
my
friend
be
good
look
amuse
and
nice
and
i
thought
it
would
be
amuse
to
see
something
of
the
girl
that
think
of
nothing
but
p
p
present
problem
and
how
to
convert
america
to
communism
most
of
them
be
madly
radical
but
some
be
extremely
intelligent
about
it
my
little
conservative
voice
will
scarcely
be
heard
above
the
uproar
but
it
will
be
fun
baiting
the
bear
that
summer
i
be
planning
to
visit
my
madeira
friend
jean
rawlings
in
san
francisco
i
still
have
her
letter
of
invitation
tell
me
about
the
wonderful
thing
we
would
do
trip
to
the
mountain
with
boy
who
be
friend
of
hers
a
rodeo
all
entice
however
my
dream
of
go
be
suddenly
blight
one
night
when
my
parent
remind
me
that
there
be
a
serious
polio
epidemic
out
west
and
insist
that
i
could
not
go
i
remember
weep
and
tell
them
that
the
idea
of
another
summer
alone
at
mount
kisco
be
almost
unendurable
my
parent
come
up
with
a
solution
a
job
on
one
of
the
chain
of
suburban
westchester
newspaper
own
by
noel
macy
later
bought
by
gannett
and
i
eagerly
grabbed
at
the
idea
and
go
to
work
on
the
mount
vernon
argus
each
day
i
commute
in
a
chevrolet
convertible
my
first
car
it
be
a
nonpaying
job
but
i
enjoy
it
and
enjoy
my
associate
i
do
the
menial
task
of
telephone
and
take
message
and
even
write
a
few
elementary
story
or
announcement
include
one
on
woman
doctor
which
be
print
with
my
byline
and
which
i
sent
off
to
my
father
who
write
back
in
an
encourage
way
i
think
it
be
very
well
write
it
look
quite
professional
in
fact
to
me
i
like
the
job
because
it
kept
me
busy
give
me
some
time
away
from
the
farm
and
also
give
me
a
structure
life
and
an
idea
of
what
work
be
like
i
be
startle
to
find
that
the
newspaper
guild
have
formally
protest
my
work
at
the
argus
for
nothing
though
individual
guild
member
be
personally
conciliatory
i
have
a
message
from
the
union
head
say
i
wish
to
explain
that
we
feel
no
animosity
towards
you
those
who
know
you
appreciate
your
effort
to
succeed
in
the
field
you
have
chosen
our
action
be
and
will
continue
to
be
a
protest
against
any
publisher
who
hire
an
employee
without
pay
him
we
hope
that
you
can
see
our
point
at
the
same
time
i
have
a
message
from
a
friend
of
my
mother

say
that
she

heard
about

little

to
make
mountain
of
any
molehill
they
can
find
it
be
my
introduction
to
union
politics
my
father
and
i
be
grow
closer
during
my
college
year
while
my
mother
and
i
be
grow
apart
he
be
so
shy
and
inarticulate
in
express
emotion
that
i
be
always
surprised
to
find
him
make
the
attempt
in
the
fall
of
when
i
be
leave
for
my
second
year
at
vassar
he
write
me
i
hate
to
think
that
soon
you
ll
be
off
to
college
and
i
to
washington
and
then
only
to
meet
at
holiday
for
another
year
and
again
when
i
go
to
europe

follow
summer

that
he
be
leave
for
the
lonely
farm
with
kate
no
longer
there
to
cheer
me
up
my
father
and
later
phil
graham
be
among
the
very
few
people
who
ever
call
me
kate
i
be
eighteen
that
second
year
of
college
the
conflict
that
have
begin
the
year
before
between
the
social
life
and
the
intellectual
and
political
life
continued
to
grow
come
out
party
be
very
much
in
vogue
the
accepted
thing
in
washington
and
a
few
people
still
spent
the
whole
year
go
to
party
in
different
city
where
they
have
family
or
tie
my
own
debut
be
limited
to
a
tea
dance
at
thanksgiving
and
a
dance
on
december
do
quite
splendidly
with
the
house
decorate
in
a
greek
theme
and
my
dress
greek
in
effect
and
gold
not
the
traditional
white
i
have
learn
enough
to
help
with
the
invitation
list
and
arrangement
my
mother
have
suggest
ask
young
joseph
alsop
the
brilliant
young
reporter
for
the
herald
tribune
whom
she
have
recently
met
when
we
be
seat
the
dinner
i
put
him
next
to
me
intrigue
by
her
description
she
have
omit
one
salient
fact
however
joe
who
be
fairly
short
then
weigh
about
pound
in
addition
he
be
extremely
sophisticated
i
be
appalled
by
his
appearance
and
unable
to
cope
with
his
mature
mind
and
presence
though
i
get
through
dinner
as
best
i
could
later
we
become
lifelong
devote
friend
but
this
be
an
odd
and
inauspicious
begin
accentuate
my
ambivalence
about
the
two
world
in
which
i
felt
myself
to
be
move
on
the
day
after
my
big
party
connie
and
i
left
by
train
for
columbus
ohio
to
attend
the
meeting
that
establish
the
american
student
union
we
have
be
ask
to
cover
it
for
the
vassar
miscellany
news
on
which
we
both
now
work
the
union
be
a
combination
of
communist
and
socialist
student
group
the
liberal
and
the
radical
willing
to
get
along
with
each
other
and
to
combine
with
unaffiliated
student
for
antifascist
purpose
it
be
a
kind
of
mirror
image
of
what
be
happen
in
the
old
political
world
where
the
same
group
have
form
the
popular
front
to
try
to
fight
the
rise
of
hitler
we
found
friend
from
dartmouth
of
more
or
less
similar
view
and
have
a
good
time
with
budd
schulberg
later
author
and
movie
producer
eddie
ryan
later
on
the
post
and
bill
leonard
later
head
of
news
for
cbs
after
go
out
together
for
a
drink
one
even
we
return
to
the
meeting
to
find
that
i
who
have
come
as
an
observer
and
a
reporter
have
be
put
on
the
national
executive
committee
this
be
part
of
a
transparent
ploy
of
the
left
wing
faction
to
be
sure
they
have
enough
visible
unattached
liberal
to
be
convincing
my
first
instinct
be
to
remove
my
name
quickly
but
a
second
which
i
follow
be
to
go
along
with
the
idea
i
be
entirely
realistic
about
the
reason
for
my
selection
and
knew
that
i
be
be
use
at
the
same
time
i
found
that
this
be
an
interest
and
unfamiliar
scene
and
thought
i
d
take
a
look
and
learn
what
it
be
all
about
when
i
told
my
father
about
be
on
the
committee
he
write
me
at
length
argue
against
journalist
join
organization
and
suggest
that
the
few
label
you
wear
the
well
in
respond
to
his
counsel
i
quietly
but
firmly
told
him
i
appreciate
the
thought
he
have
obviously
give
to
all
side
of
the
question
and
agree
with
most
of
his
point
particularly
that
there
be
certain
danger
inherent
in
so
call
mass
think
i
also
agree
that
label
be
undesirable
but
i
explain
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
all
concerned
if
i
be
to
resign
at
that
time
my
father
write
back
at
once
thank
me
for
my
letter
and
conclude
with
what
be
one
of
the
simplest
and
best
precept
for
parent
to
live
by
that
i
have
ever
read
it
meant
a
lot
to
me
then
as
it
do
even
today
what
parent
may
sometimes
do
in
a
helpful
way
be
to
point
out
certain
principle
of
action
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
helpful
in
advise
you
too
strongly
i
do
not
even
feel
the
need
of
do
that
because
i
have
so
much
confidence
in
your
have
really
good
judgment
i
believe
that
what
i
can
do
for
you
once
in
a
while
be
to
point
out
certain
principle
that
have
developed
in
my
mind
as
sound
and
practical
leave
it
for
you
yourself
to
apply
them
if
your
own
mind
grasp
and
approves
the
principle
this
issue
which
might
have
become
a
separate
bone
of
contention
between
us
be
a
good
example
of
how
my
relationship
with
my
father
work
and
the
care
and
concern
that
be
evident
on
both
our
part
he
be
probably
gently
try
to
persuade
me
not
to
join
a
group
that
include
communist
but
he
didn
t
persist
my
mother
on
the
other
hand
do
take
stand
and
indeed
political
job
in
the
spring
of
she
be
run
alf
landon
s
radio
campaign
although
dad
have
apparently
try
to
talk
her
out
of
it
as
usual
she
sprang
into
action
with
total
enthusiasm
she
write
me
that
spring
with
her
characteristic
excitement
about
her
current
project
landon
be
a
home
run
much
more
important
than
the
writer
chap
have
picture
him
i
have
to
do
a
job
later
still
besotted
with
her
own
contribution
to
his
image
she
write
i
be
do
a
red
hot
talk
on
landon
the
man
on
a
national
hook
up
such
fun
landon
s
acceptance
speech
be
good
but
i
can
always
put
him
over
well
than
he
can
because
he
hasn
t
the
habit
of
put
himself
into
speech
i
can
t
help
wonder
sometimes
what
he
think
of
himself
when
i
get
through
with
him
she
have
blinder
on
to
such
an
extent
that
when
election
eve
come
around
she
be
still
think
landon
might
defeat
fdr
at
about
the
same
time
that
she
be
become
deeply
involve
with
the
republican
campaign
she
spoke
at
a
town
hall
program
a
very
prominent
radio
discussion
group
with
mr
roosevelt
preside
as
always
she
write
me
in
advance
to
make
sure
i
would
tune
in
and
add
as
an
incentive
that
she
would
defend
your
student
union
and
jibe
at
teacher
and
pupil
oath
i
be
pleased
that
she
might
mention
the
asu
in
her
speech
but
not
a
little
worried
about
what
she
might
go
on
to
say
in
fact
she
get
in
a
row
about
the
new
deal
with
mr
roosevelt
her
next
letter
to
me
express
hurt
feeling
at
my
silence
i
judge
from
your
silence
that
you
do
not
care
for
my
speech
very
much
but
as
far
as
the
world
be
concerned
i
be
a
hero
before
i
left
the
hall
i
begin
get
telegram
and
when
we
get
back
to
the
hotel
there
be
numerous
long
distance
telephone
call
one
from
bi
very
enthusiastic
the
fan
mail
be
come
in
hot
and
heavy
and
all
of
it
approve
and
even
enthusiastic
the
animosity
which
the
letter
breathe
for
the
roosevelt
be
unbelievable
i
enclose
a
typical
one
for
your
amusement
this
be
yet
another
of
my
one
way
conversation
with
my
mother
that
consist
entirely
of
her
tell
me
of
the
overwhelm
reception
of
her
late
speech
mass
ovation
and
demand
for
thousand
of
copy
this
kind
of
self
delusion
and
overwhelm
need
for
adulation
make
any
exchange
with
her
increasingly
difficult
for
me
and
i
think
for
all
of
us
in
the
spring
of
i
get
involve
in
organize
a
nationwide
peace

as
if
on

that
underlined
the
schism
in
my
think
connie
and
i
be

by
the
senior
at
vassar
to
be
among
the
few
girl
picked
for
the
daisy
chain
allegedly
for
pulchritude
and
other
sterling
quality
but
in
reality
because
they
like
you
we
be
somewhat
embarrass
since
the
daisy
chain
be
an
old
fashion
ritual
but
secretly
we
be
pleased
and
soothe
our
self
conscious
self
by
compose
a
poem
of
acceptance
that
be
title
to
the
upper
class
from
two
in
chain
only
the
second
verse
of
this
epic
survives
and
read
we
thank
the
class
of
they
ve
put
us
in
a
pretty
fix
between
class
struggle
we
must
choose
the
proletariat
or
youse
but
we
ll
not
be
the
c
p
s
bane
we
ll
organize
the
daisy
chain
my
mother
on
receive
a
copy
of
this
poem
respond
enthusiastically
about
the
verse
not
the
tap
and
philosophize
in
this
democratic
country
nothing
make
so
much
impression
as
be
elect
to
something
popularity
count
ala
for
a
darn
sight
more
than
merit
look
at
franklyn
meaning
of
course
fdr
the
best
we
can
hope
be
that
popularity
without
merit
eventually
becomes
cloy
connie
and
i
have
discuss
make
a
trip
to
the
soviet
union
that
summer
follow
our
sophomore
year
the
summer
of
although
my
mother
s
first
reaction
have
be
positive
my
father
vetoed
the
idea
with
vehemence
i
plead
for
russia
argue
politely
that
we
could
book
an
excite
and
cheap
tour
conduct
by
intourist
which
i
call
the
reliable
and
official
russian
travel
bureau
i
add
fuel
to
my
argument
i
thought
by
say
that
we
would
shorten
our
plan
stay
in
the
soviet
union
to
two
week
we
would
go
in
the
early
part
of
the
summer
when
connie
s
family
would
still
be
in
western
europe
and
therefore
close
enough
to
help
us
if
there
be
a
problem
and
i
would
be
back
to
spend
september
on
the
post
with
my
father
dad
do
not
agree
with
my
logic
he
telegraph
his
okay
to
western
europe
only
and
follow
up
with
a
letter
explain
his
reason
these
be
very
troublous
time
more
so
than
i
can
expect
you
to
realize
you
know
i
be
sure
that
i
do
not
say
no
to
you
lightly
you
be
one
kid
that
be
generally
so
reasonable
in
everything
that
i
be
anxious
always
to
say
yes
to
you
i
can
t
see
you
go
so
far
to
the
eastern
part
of
europe
under
present
condition
unless
i
be
free
to
devote
myself
solely
to
the
job
of
get
you
out
in
case
of
trouble
i
be
not
in
that
position
now
much
love
maybe
you
and
i
will
go
there
together
someday
when
connie
and
i
left
for
europe
at
the
end
of
june
we
make
quite
a
travel
troupe
give
connie

and
a

twenty
nine
piece
of

we
go
first
to
london
and
although
i
recognize
the
seriousness
of
the
political
situation
i
found
it
quite
a
gay
place
with
everyone
excite
about
the
king
s
garden
party
in
paris
l
on
blum
the
socialist
be
the
head
of
a
popular
front
government
and
politics
make
themselves
felt
everywhere
exacerbate
for
us
no
doubt
by
our
have
arrive
in
the
city
on
the
day
before

in
addition
to
the
usual
military
parade
there
be
a
popular
front
demonstration
which
give
me
the
most
impressive
feel
of
communal
strength
i
have
ever
have
there
be
two
separate
march
line
that
eventually
met
and
come
together
sing
into
the
place
de
la
bastille
the
spirit
with
which
the
crowd
pour
in
about
strong
make
it
easy
to
visualize
previous
scene
at
the
same
location
connie
and
i
join
the
march
attach
ourselves
to
the
boulangers
a
group
of
baker
and
walk
with
them
for
a
couple
of
hour
as
if
to
make
an
even
great
point
of
our
be
pull
in
opposite
direction
at
once
we
broke
off
from
the
popular
front
parade
to
have
lunch
with
my
aunt

by
length
of

position
of
some
eminence
our
morning
s
march
be
in
marked
contrast
to
elise
s
usual
activity
and
it
amuse
her
greatly
that
connie
and
i
have
join
her
lunch
straight
from
the
parade
she
kept
tell
us
throughout
the
meal
to
tell
princess
so
and
so
and
sir
so
and
so
what
you
do
this
morning
so
we
lead
a
highly
varied
life
on
our
trip
in
paris
i
take
connie
to
have
dinner
with
brancusi
one
night
i
be
so
eager
to
see
him
that
i
rang
the
bell
madly
and
burst
into
the
studio
when
the
door
open
only
to
be
confront
by
a
strange
face
full
of
the
exuberance
of
youth
i
exclaim
my
goodness
where
s
brancusi
and
who
be
you
he
turn
out
to
be
pierre
matisse
henri
s
son
and
he
stayed
to
dinner
the
four
of
us
ate
in
brancusi
s
totally
white
studio
sit
on
block
of
marble
around
another
huge
chunk
of
marble
which
serve
as
the
table
when
it
be
time
to
eat
brancusi
produce
large
sheet
of
a
kind
of
shiny
white
paper
and
put
them
around
like
placemats
my
memory
be
that
everything
we
ate
be
white
too
although
i
m
sure
that
wasn
t
the
case
we
return
to
england
for
a
student
meeting
at
oxford
and
lunch
with
harold
laski
and
then
be
off
to
salzburg
where
mother
have
treat
us
to
the
hotel
bristol
and
ticket
to
the
music
festival
there
because
i
have
heed
my
father
s
instruction
to
stay
well
on
the
western
side
of
europe
connie
and
i
now
part
company
as
she
head
for
the
soviet
union
but
though
i
be
sad
to
see
her
leave
without
me
for
the
great
adventure
i
don
t
remember
any
feel
of
resentment
at
have
be
forbidden
to
go
with
her
i
have
accepted
my
father
s
verdict
chapter
five
on
a
train
trip
to
mount
kisco
with
my
father
later
that
summer
i
broach
the
idea
of
my
study
at
the
london
school
of
economics
as
my
brother
bill
have
the
follow
year
it
be
met
with
an
immediate
no
he
believe
that
bill
have
be
too
young
intellectually
too
immature
to
put
european
social
problem
in
context
and
he
thought
i
be
too
but
he
say
that
he
understood
why
i
want
to
leave
vassar
and
that
it
be
all
right
with
him
if
i
go
anywhere
else
in
this
country
i
be
so
take
aback
that
i
could
hardly
think
of
an
alternative
to
london
but
i
thought
i
have
to
respond
instantly
rather
than
do
the
natural
thing
which
be
to
think
it
over
so
i
make
an
instantaneous
decision
i
hit
on
the
university
of
chicago
not
out
of
a
sudden
impulse
toward
serious
study
but
simply
because
there
flash
into
my
mind
a
picture
i
have
see
while
flip
through
the
page
of
redbook
magazine
of
robert
maynard
hutchins
the
university
s
young
handsome
dynamic
president
the
cutlines
under
his
picture
say
that
he
be
revolutionize
the
learn
process
and
shake
thing
up
with
new
and
interest
idea
about
college
education
and
that
the
university
be
in
an
intellectual
ferment
or
something
of
the
sort
i
hadn
t
focus
on
it
as
i
flip
the
page
but
now
i
add
thing
up
quickly
it
be
in
the
midwest
i
have
never
live
off
the
eastern
seaboard
it
be
coeducational
and
it
be
in
a
city
okay
i
say
i
ll
go
to
chicago
and
in
fact
with
no
more
thought
than
that
off
i
go
arrive
in
chicago
less
than
a
month
after
our
conversation
on
the
train
i
hadn
t
foreseen
the
magnitude
of
the
decision
i
d
make
and
didn
t
realize
what
i
be
in
for
until
i
be
already
in
the
thick
of
it
my
father
have
come
with
me
to
chicago
to
enter
me
in
the
university
and
find
me
a
place
to
live
but
once
he
left
i
be
completely
on
my
own
in
a
strange
environment
and
a
sea
of
thousand
of
student
with
only
one
or
two
casual
acquaintance
maybe
it
be
lucky
that
i
hadn
t
have
the
time
or
the
sense
to
envision
be
so
alone
i
might
well
have
pull
back
probably
i
reassure
myself
with
the
thought
that
i
be
planning
to
stay
only
one
year
and
could
always
return
to
vassar
indeed
i
kept
that
safety
net
by
tell
the
college
i
would
be
back
but
little
by
little
life
sort
itself
out
and
the
university
be
good
for
me
eventually
i
found
my
way
grow
to
love
the
place
and
stay
on
to
graduate
i
live
on
the
edge
of
the
campus
at
international
house
which
be
fill
with
foreign
student
graduate
student
and
some
transfer
student
like
me
we
all
ate
in
the
cafeteria
sit
at
round
table
that
afford
opportunity
for
make
friend
and
acquaintance
of
every
kind
before
too

with
a
graduate
student
sidney
hyman
who
be
much
around

on

and
i
fell
into
conversation
about
our
share
enthusiasm
for
thomas

and
we
talk
for
hour

long
bar
in

of
which
be
a
row
of
small
square
table
with
red
and
white
checked
tablecloth
where
you
could
sit
with
your
friend
and
nurse
a
beer
or
two
all
night
after
a
few
month
i
be
approach
by
member
of
two
different
club
mortar
board
and
quadrangle
similar
to
sorority
suggest
that
i
join
i
go
to
a
meeting
of
one
where
lot
of
young
woman
be
sit
around
many
of
them
play
bridge
it
wasn
t
the
kind
of
atmosphere
i
be
use
to
even
at
vassar
shortly
afterwards
a
friend
of
mine
who
be
a
member
of
mortar
board
ask
if
i
be
really
interested
in
join
and
say
that
if
i
be
she
would
go
to
bat
for
me
she
be
willing
to
take
on
a
fight
about
my
be
jewish
but
not
if
there
be
nothing
to
be
serve
by
fight
have
have
no
idea
that
my
be
consider
jewish
be
an
issue
i
be
startle
and
assure
her
that
i
wasn
t
really
interested
later
a
friend
told
me
that
the
quadrangle
have
actually
disband
over
the
question
of
admit
me
to
membership
this
be
one
of
the
very
few
instance
in
which
anti
semitism
touch
me
directly
in
those
early
year
and
i
be
more
surprised
than
distressed
by
it
chicago
then
be
a
center
of
intellectual
turmoil
the
university
be
a
distinctly
urban
school
with
mostly
nonaffluent
student
some
excellent
faculty
and
high
intellectual
standard
because
hutchins
have
become
enthral
by
the
theory
that
education
consist
in
reading
the
great
book
of
the
western
world
and
absorb
their
idea
the
academic
program
be
very
different
from
that
at
most
college
hutchins
have
be
influence
by
mortimer
adler
who
be
the
lead
exponent
of
these
idea
and
by
st
john
college
where
they
have
previously
be
try
out
hutchins
have
also
abolish
football
and
other
athletics
the
whole
thing
be
slightly
flaky
but
stimulate
a
universe
of
its
own
and
important
for
me
a
far
cry
from
vassar
i
have
decide
on
american
history
as
my
major
so
i
enrol
in
survey
course
in
economics
and
in
history
and
despite
some
trepidation
the
course
in
the
great
book
taught
jointly
by
hutchins
and
adler
it
start
with
plato
and
aristotle
work
up
through
st
thomas
aquinas
and
other
philosopher
and
end
with
freud
and
marx
and
engels
this
class
which
be
suppose
to
teach
you
how
to
read
a
book
as
adler
later
title
one
of
his
own
book
met
once
a
week
for
two
solid
sometimes
torture
hour
about
thirty
of
us
sat
around
an
oblong
table
and
hutchins
or
adler
or
both
would
use
the
socratic
method
in
discuss
what
we
have
read
and
test
us
for
the
whole
two
hour
the
two
men
hammer
away
bullying
us
unmercifully
well
miss
meyer
tell
us
in
your
own
word
what
aristotle
think
about
this
what
do
you
think
about
what
he
say
do
you
really
think
that
good
behavior
follow
from
good
value
what
be
good
habit
what
be
good
value
if
that
s
what
you
think
what
if
such
and
such
happen
the
method
they
use
often
taught
you
most
about
bullying
back
about
stand
up
to
hutchins
and
adler
about
challenge
them
and
fundamentally
please
them
by
do
it
with
gusto
and
verve
so
that
they
be
amuse
if
you
learn
to
cope
with
their
method
you
could
stay
afloat
when
i
didn
t
do
well
the
most
awful
depression
set
in
because
so
much
depend
on
that
performance
when
i
do
do
well
my
elation
carry
over
to
everything
else
i
be
do
at
the
university
despite
its
intimidation
the
course
be
good
for
me
and
i
actually
get
an
a
in
it
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
my
father
who
strongly
believe
in
chicago
s
educational
theory
be
thrill
at
my
grade
and
sent
me
a
check
for
which
i
say
i
would
spend
on
book
by
plato
and
aristotle
to
commemorate
the
event
i
suggest
he
may
have
overreact
because
mark
don
t
mean
much
out
here
and
adler
usually
deal
them
out
pretty
irrationally
though
he
teach
logic
he
know
well
than
to
base
his
conduct
upon
it
for
all
i
knew
i
add
the
mark
may
have
be
the
result
of
the
ride
home
in
the
car
when
as
i
told
you
we
get
on
very
well
i
be
still
find
it
difficult
to
learn
the
right
balance
between
social
and
academic
activity
mr
kellogg
fairbank
a
friend
of
my
mother
s
who
once
described
herself
to
me
as
that
person
in
chicago
who
vote
for
landon
be
my
one
link
except
for
tayloe
to
the
social
scene
beyond
the
university
she
live
in
a
large
stylish
lakefront
apartment
and
occasionally
include
me
in
her
lunch
or
dinner
party
and
invite
me
to
her
weekend
house
after
these
event
i
always
make
what
i
thought
be
the
polite
card
gesture
often
worry
about
whether
i
be
suppose
to
leave
one
card
or
two
and
whether
i
have
to
turn
the
corner
down
even
as
a
college
junior
and
while
the
outside
world
be
change
so
dramatically
i
be
concerned
to
make
sure
i
be
adhere
to
the
proper
way
do
the
correct
thing
make
the
appropriate
gesture
through
an
old
beau
of
my
sister
flo
s
i
met
a
classicist
migr
professor
giuseppe
antonio
borgese
whose
book
goliath
i
have
read
and
respect
i
found
him
to
be
a
bit
of
a
madman
but
very
entertain
and
very
bright
soon
afterwards
i
be
excite
and
flatter
to
be
invite
to
dinner
by
borgese
we
ate
in
downtown
chicago
a
great
treat
since
we
student
live
almost
exclusively
in
south
chicago
the
area
around
the
university
on
the
way
back
from
dinner
he
quiz
me
about
how
many
of
my
classmate
i
thought
be
still
virgin
a
question
entirely
beyond
my
ability
to
answer
or
even
guess
at
there
be
other
lead
question
follow
by
an
invitation
to
inspect
his
apartment
i
be
still
so
young
and
unsuspecting
that
poor
borgese
obviously
take
my
acceptance
as
an
agreement
to
amorous
advance
but
be
so
na
ve
about
sexual
relation
i
be
surprised
when
the
distinguish
professor
make
a
pas
at
me
when
i
resist
he
pursue
me
and
i
found
myself
race
around
his
desk
the
professor
in
pursuit
finally
i
insist
on
leave
and
he
drove
me
home
surprisingly
he
call
and
ask
me
out
again
i
be
in
such
a
panic
about
offend
the
great
man
that
i
go
to
the
university
s
infirmary
and
insist
i
have
appendicitis
when
the
doctor
assure
me
i
be
in
fine
health
i
have
to
tell
the
professor
i
be
unable
to
go
out
with
him
a
monstrously
difficult
thing
for
me
to
do
it
almost
kill
me
with
mortification
my
political
outlook
developed
far
as
a
commit
liberal
primarily
passionately
antifascist
and
sympathetic
toward
the
labor
movement
yet
though
i
be
engage
in
liberal
think
and
activity
i
remain
basically
conservative
i
have
never
encounter
real
communist
until
i
reach
chicago
the
american
student
union
there
be
very
different
from
the
one
i
d
left
behind
at
vassar
which
have
be
run
by
girl
who
be
relatively
new
to
politics
and
whose
passion
the
political
one
at
least
weren
t
all
that
deep
i
be
greet
effusively
by
the
chicago
branch
of
the
union
which
be
mostly
compose
of
communist
and
socialist
of
a
rather
boring
mind
set
an
exception
be
a
young
british
graduate
student
norman
o
brown
a
commonwealth
fellow
who
take
me
to
a
few
meeting
and
to
dinner
he
kept
suggest
that
i
join
the
young
communist
since
they
and
the
parent
party
be
the
most
effective
antifascist
force
in
the
world
at
that
time
with
the
rise
of
hitler
and
mussolini
and
franco
fight
against
the
force
of
spanish
democracy
this
argument
could
be
make
with
some
force
the
ghastly
crime
of
stalin
have
not
yet
be
reveal
and
when
the
famous
trial
start
they
be
at
least
initially
view
ambivalently
by
even
the
liberal
among
us
i
remain
unpersuaded
and
wonder
whether
brown
might
be
a
communist
himself
assign
to
convert
me
in
response
to
his
proselytize
i
eventually
write
him
a
letter
which
i
later
found
in
one
of
my
textbook
and
probably
never
sent
in
which
i
say
that
although
my
parent
be
do
certain
thing
with
which
i
disagreed
i
love
them
be
grateful
for
the
circumstance
into
which
i
be
born
appreciate
what
i
have
and
have
no
desire
to
revolt
against
any
of
it
i
didn
t
want
to
help
overthrow
a
system
that
i
knew
i
belong
to
although
i
certainly
understood
that
there
be
problem
that
should
be
address
i
m
not
sure
why
when
many
of
my
friend
have
join
the
party
i
have
the
resolve
to
reject
it
perhaps
there
be
a
balance
weakness
at
work
one
that
have
long
be
a
part
of
me
that
inherent
desire
to
conform
to
please
to
abide
by
law
to
be
a
good
girl
if
you
will
anyway
very
luckily
for
the
washington
post
during
the
mccarthy
era
when
we
be
constantly
be
attack
as
red
by
various
constituency
i
never
have
be
a
member
in
the
spring
of
my
first
year
at
chicago
i
take
a
course
on
labor
relation
from
paul
douglas
later
a
united
state
senator
and
grow
interested
in
labor
problem
this
be
a
time
of
broad
scale
industrial
organization
that
be
be
resist
by
the
steel
coal
and
automobile
company
in
extremely
forceful
even
violent
way
my
sympathy
lay
with
the
right
to
organize
and
they
haven
t
change
in
that
respect
although
i
have
grown
to
regard
some
union
leadership
and
tactic
with
a
degree
of
skepticism
but
at
this
time
the
great
mass
of
worker
in
the
industrial
area
have
no
way
of
deal
jointly
with
employer
i
become
friend
with
ralph

me
that
there
be
go
to
be
a
confrontation
of
some
sort
between
the
striker
and
the
company
and
invite
me
to
go
with
him
to

distance
but
i

scar
ralph
have
left
me
behind
for
safety
and
have
go
nearer
the
steelworker

and
the
guard
or
the
police
suddenly
fire
on
them
kill
seven
and
wound
others
pandemonium
and
fear
of

spread
even
to
where
i
be
stand
and
we
all
pile
into
any
available
vehicle
and
flee
this
horrify
scene
after
recover
from
this
traumatic
event
we
return
once

twice
to

out
i
ask
for
permission
mention
the
washington
post
as
well
as
the
daily
news
and
learn
a
never
to
be
forgotten
lesson
about
the
power
of
a
washington
newspaper
even
though
the
post
be
a
minor
one
at
that
time
we

contribution
i
do
make
to
the

in

i
told
my

about
the
comic
strip
terry
and
the

which
be
the
talk
of
chicago

my

about
this

that
i
thought
it
be
corny
and
try
to
have
it
both
way
and
that
for
me
this
be
one
of
the
post
s
low
moment
to
which
he
respond
instantly
and
aggressively
he
thought
it
be
a
great
idea
and
report
that
other
paper
have
participate
too

far
defend
himself
by
say
the
associate
press
have
carry
the
story
and
even
time
have
mention
it
he
add
i
be
afraid
that
your
chicago
atmosphere
and
remoteness
prevents
your
exercise
the
good
keen
journalistic
understand
on
this
matter
which
i
know
you
would
have
be
capable
of
have
you
be
here
on
the
spot
this
be
as
overt
a
difference
as
we
ever
have
even
when
he
be
criticize
my
judgment
he
be
always
kind
and
supportive
it
say
a
lot
for
my
father
s
equanimity
that
he
be
unbothered
by
this
kind
of
exchange
in
fact
he
relish
difference
of
opinion
and
sharp
exchange
as
sign
that
people
have
mind
of
their
own
for
example
he
have
start
small
trust
fund
for
all
of
us
at
birth
he
do
this
because
he
felt
his
own
father
have
use
money
to
control
his
child
and
he
didn
t
want
to
do
the
same
thing
he
want
us
to
be
independent
of
his
will
what
i
didn
t
grasp
at
the
time
be
my
father
s
real
bias
in
my
favor
the
depth
of
his
care
my
mother
s
hint
that
he
have
a
crush
on
me
and
the
story
she
relayed
of
his
hoard
my
letter
didn
t
sink
in
in
retrospect
i
can
see
this
intense
affection
we
have
for
each
other
and
what
an
enormous
influence
he
have
on
my
life
my
plan
and
my
think
i
m
not
sure
why
i
wasn
t
aware
of
it
at
the
time
but
it
s
clear
to
me
now
that
he
believe
in
me
which
become
a
very
powerful
emotional
asset
as
i
grow
old
and
give
me
a
measure
of
security
which
i
greatly
need
relation
with
my
mother
be
different
she
be
become
more
and
more
difficult
and
self
center
it
be
hopeless
to
ask
her
a
personal
question
or
for
advice
she
have
construct
an
image
of
what
we
be
all
like
and
what
our
life
be
like
and
she
never
really
look
to
see
if
the
reality
fit
her
image
after
the
election
mother
return
to
washington
a
little
sadder
not
too
much
so
and
a
good
deal
wiser
my
father
not
really
one
to
say
i
told
you
so
do
take
some
consolation
from
have
advise
her
to
stay
out
of
the
job
she
have
gotten
herself
into
with
landon
my
one
meeting
with
her
candidate
be
a
perfect
example
of
the
contrast
between
the
two
world
in
which
i
be
move
that
of
my
republican
parent
and
my
more
liberal
university
environment
just
a
few
week
after
the
election
i
be
take
the
overnight
train
home
for
the
thanksgiving
holiday
sidney
hyman
and
some
other
friend
come
down
to
the
station
to
see
me
off
and
as
a
goodbye
bouquet
present
me
with
a
real
hammer
and
sickle
tie
up
with
a
red
bow
there
be
nothing
to
do
with
this
awkward
joke
but
take
it
with
me
i
arrive
home
next
morning
still
carry
the
unwieldy
implement
and
walk
into
the
washington
house
where
the
door
be
open
by
the
butler
and
i
found
my
parent
in
the
library
confer
with
the
defeat
candidate
alf
landon
himself
i
hastily
dispose
of
the
hammer
and
sickle
before
join
them
it
be
during
the
s
that
my
mother
start
seriously
on
her
career
of
speechmaking
on
a
variety
of
issue
particularly
welfare
and
education
her
letter
to
me
be
fuller
than
ever
of
account
of
speech
of
audience
size
and
of
the
enthusiastic
reaction
she
always
receive
and
the
many
demand
for
copy
she
have
enormous
and
wide
range
intellectual
interest
and
write
on
many
subject
in
fact
at
this
point
her
life
center
on
her
write
for
a
couple
of
year
she
often
go
alone
to
the
cabin
as
we
call
the
lovely
smallish
modern
house
my
parent
have
built
overlook
the
potomac
river
in
virginia
about
half
an
hour
from
town
to
work
on
her
book
on
tolstoy
dostoyevsky
and
mann
it
be
during
this
time
that
she
begin
another
of
her
passionate
friendship
with
men
one
that
consume
her
and
threaten
her
equanimity
even
as
it
sustain
and
enrich
her
this
one
be
with
thomas
mann
and
even
before
she
met
the
man
himself
she
have
fall
for
him
through
his
writing
have
earlier
discover
his
novel
for
myself
i
have
become
an
enthusiast
but
my
mother
go
far
in
april
of
she
finally
saw
mann
in
person
when
she
go
to
new
york
to
hear
him
lecture
on
wagner
at
the
new
school
and
be
completely
bowl
over
by
the
experience
call
him
an
absorb
if
unrequited
passion
admire
him
as
both
a
writer
and
a
human
be
a
second
lecture
on
freud
only
increase
her
first
impression
that
here
be
one
of
the
few
authentically
great
men
of
the
day
she
be
delighted
to
find
that
such
a
great
soul
exists
in
our
poor
age
and
immediately
decide
to
interview
him
for
the
post
she
who
be
cynical
about
conspicuous
member
of
society
or
so
she
claimed
she
who
described
herself
as
someone
who
would
rather
meet
an
honest
shoemaker
than
the
average
artist
be
so
overcome
with
emotion
when
she
arrive
for
the
interview
to
be
held
in
german
of
course
that
she
scarcely
felt
equal
to
the
task
when
she
actually
met
him
her
excitement
be
unbounded
and
contagious
in
a
letter
to
me
she
described
the
experience
in
great
detail
and
revealingly
his
wife
a
brilliant
eyed
charm
rather
elderly
woman
receive
me
and
my
confusion
increase
when
i
realize
i
would
have
to
interview
him
in
front
of
her
three
men
have
to
be
put
out
before
i
be
admit
and
i
could
see
other
people
wait
impatiently
for
me
to
get
out
that
isn
t
exactly
conducive
to
a
helpful
atmosphere
and
together
with
my
attack
of
hero
worship
well
nigh
make
me
speechless
when
the
great
man
come
forward
to
greet
me
it
take
all
the
training
in
self
control
that
i
have
ever
have
to
proceed
but
i
have
plan
an
intelligent
question
which
i
now
heard
myself
recite
like
a
schoolgirl
a
flash
of
recognition
of
my
question
s
validity
be
visible
and
then
i
could
almost
see
him
reach
up
to
a
certain
definite
compartment
of
his
mind
where
just
the
right
answer
be
store
for
fifteen
minute
he
talk
like
a
machine
gun
in
the
most
fluent
subtle
german
with
long
perfect
sentence
and
paragraph
just
as
precise
and
complicate
as
his
write
style
i
never
once
look
up
at
him
because
i
have
to
write
like
mad
to
get
some
of
his
vocabulary
and
a
few
of
his
idea
when
he
have
finish
his
wife
indicate
that
my
time
be
up
we
exchange
a
few
more
remark
reveal
on
my
part
a
well
nigh
subnormal
intelligence
and
after
a
short
exchange
of
courtesy
with
his
wife
i
take
my
broken
heart
and
my
wound
vanity
into
the
street
when
my
mother
return
to
washington
from
the
meeting
she
be
still
so
uplifted
by
mann
s
word
the
power
of
his
personality
and
her
belief
in
his
importance
to
liberal
thought
throughout
the
world
that
she
write
him
her
version
of
a
fan
letter
the
next
day
exhaust
as
she
say
by
the
storm
of
my
emotion
she
set
to
work
on
the
interview
which
duly
appear
in
the
post
this
experience
with
mann
or
more
important
the
strength
of
her
feeling
for
him
compel
her
to
advise
me
be
a
newspaperwoman
kay
if
only
for
the
excuse
it
give
you
to
seek
out
at
once
the
object
of
any
sudden
passion
mother
s
physical
problem
be
always
dramatize
as
be
her
emotional
one
as
her
attachment
to
mann
grow
so
too
do
her
emotional
instability
the
first
overt
evidence
of
a
serious
problem
occur
the
summer
of
at
our
ranch
in
wyoming
my
parent
have
picked
me
up
that
summer
after
i
finish
my
course
in
chicago
and
take
ruthie
and
me
to
the
ranch
to
spend
some
time
there
relax
it
be
a
traumatic
stay
mother
be
go
through
a
king
size
change
of
life
and
i
suppose
depression
exacerbate
her
already
highly
excitable
state
she
have
start
to
drink
noticeably
by
then
one
day
when
we
be
all
out
for
a
ride
in
the
beautiful
valley
her
horse
ran
away
with
her
ruthie
an
excellent
rider
far
well
than
i
be
near
to
her
and
take
out
after
her
as
do
the
cowboy
her
horse
be
caught
and
somehow
stop
but
something
have
snap
it
be
an
emotional
explosion
she
go
completely
to
piece
fought
with
my
father
and
generally
retreat
from
him
into
her
own
cabin
where
she
start
to
drink
seriously
we
be
all
deeply
disturbed
my
father
could
do
nothing
with
her
and
it
fell
to
me
to
try
to
help
her
to
find
out
what
be
the
matter
and
try
to
calm
her
down
the
day
after
the
runaway
horse
scare
she
climbed
up
a
nearby
mountain
i
go
after
her
really
worried
about
what
she
might
do
she
be
so
distraught
and
finally
caught
up
with
her
near
the
top
where
we
sat
down
and
talk
some
of
the
time
i
talk
while
she
wept
she
have
get
so
fervently
involve
with
mann
and
his
write
that
he
seem
bound
up
in
all
her
thought
and
feeling
when
she
talk
she
concentrate
on
how
wonderful
he
be
how
much
he
meant
to
her
how
brave
and
perceptive
he
be
how
she
understood
him
and
could
help
him
what
a
terrible
world
it
be
in
which
he
be
an
exile
from
his
country
and
in
which
even
people
here
in
the
united
state
didn
t
understand
or
appreciate
him
luckily
i
could
sympathize
so
i
be
able
to
discus
there
in
the
most
incredible
of
setting
his
writing
and
greatness
with
her
and
eventually
to
calm
her
down
enough
to
get
her
off
the
mountain
but
for
the
rest
of
our
stay
on
the
ranch
she
remain
more
or
less
seclude
in
bed
or
drinking
but
not
communicate
especially
not
with
my
father
from
then
on
i
increasingly
begin
to
act
as
an
adult
to
help
with
ruthie
still
in
high
school
at
madeira
and
quite
often
with
my
mother
on
a
personal
level
you
have
to
sustain
her
and
very
little
come
back
in
exchange
this
be
especially
hard
on
ruthie
who
be
at
home
be
require
to
fit
in
with
whatever
mother
need
or
want
to
do
without
realize
it
mother
be
use
ruthie
for
company
i
found
i
actually
enjoy
the
responsibility
and
be
of
help
and
during
this
time
my
father
and
i
grow
even
closer
the
fact
that
i
share
his
interest
in
journalism
and
public
issue
no
doubt
increase
our
closeness
but
so
do
my
help
with
my
mother
s
distress
by
the
end
of
my
first
year
at
chicago
i
have
decide
i
wouldn
t
return
to
vassar
but
would
stay
on
i
have
found
an
intellectually
stimulate
academic
environment
have
developed
wonderful
friendship
have
grown
up
significantly
and
enjoy
myself
very
much
indeed
but
i
go
on
experience
the
usual
angst
about
who
i
be
and
how
to
survive
the
great
strength
and
influence
of
the
family
i
have
occasional
romantic
flirtation
sometimes
on
my
part
sometimes
on
a
young
man
s
but
rarely
both
at
once
one
of
these
attachment
be
a
strange
emotional
relationship
with
a
political
scientist
hal
winkler
who
be
much
shorter
than
i
but
very
intense
and
passionate
i
be
always
attract
physically
to
brilliance
and
he
be
brilliant
or
so
it
seem
to
me
but
i
be
still
shy
and
virginal
and
didn
t
know
how
to
cope
with
sexual
advance
i
apparently
go
on
look
a
great
deal
more
direct
and
together
than
i
felt
one
of
the
most
significant
thing
to
occur
in
the
fall
of
my
senior
year
be
a
visit
from
my
sister
bi
who
be
then
work
in
california
i
be
always
excite
at
the
prospect
of
see
bi
who
have
be
in
europe
new
york
and
hollywood
while
i
be
in
washington
vassar
and
chicago
her
friend
remain
glamorous
and
even
famous
in
europe
she
have
somehow
grown
friendly
with
queen
marie
of
romania
and
her
daughter
princess
illeana
in
new
york
she
have
be
friendly
with
and
even
court
by
the
playwright
sam
behrman
and
she
saw
a
good
deal
of
george
gershwin
oscar
levant
and
harpo
marx
visit
the
famous
herbert
swope
and
his
wife
and
knew
alexander
woollcott
dorothy
parker
and
others
of
the
algonquin
set
she
have
a
serious
romance
with
a
movie
producer
whom
she
want
to
marry
an
idea
nixed
by
my
mother
who
thought
it
unsuitable
mother
once
told
me
proudly
how
she
have
stop
bi
from
go
to
hollywood
and
marry
this
young
man
she
say
she
go
up
to
our
family
s
new
york
apartment
where
bi
be
living
and
argue
with
her
for
a
week
bi
remain
adamant
until
my
mother
say
bi
if
you
do
this
it
will
kill
your
father
and
that
say
my
mother
with
satisfaction
stop
her
the
visit
bi
and
i
have
in
chicago
be
extraordinary
we
spoke
at
length
about
the
complexity
of
be
a
member
of
this
overwhelm
meyer
family
of
what
it
meant
positively
and
negatively
and
of
what
we
both
want
to
do
with
our
life
on
the
train
even
as
it
be
pull
out
of
the
station
bi
begin
a
long
letter
to
me
so
full
of
her
essence
and
so
full
of
insight
into
the
family
that
i
ve
kept
it
always
she
write
on
november
i
wish
i
have
have
time
to
talk
about
your
own
problem
which
in
the
light
of
my
experience
seem
very
difficult
and
complicate
one
of
the
hardest
problem
for
all
of
us
be
the
one
which
i
believe
be
at
the
root
of
flo
s
doings
and
which
i
see
little
or
no
hope
of
her
even
realize
let
alone
solve
that
be
the
difficulty
arise
from
the
fact
that
from
early
childhood
we
have
all
through
what
be
say
and
what
be
unsaid
in
the
family
circle
have
the
feel
that
we
be
born
to
do
big
thing
it
be
just
a
question
of
choose
the
line
best
suit
to
us
hardly
even
the
line
we
be
best
suit
to
there
be
no
question
but
that
whatever
it
be
we
have
to
be
best
at
it
mother
even
use
to
say
that
remember
i
don
t
care
what
any
of
you
kid
do
even
if
one
of
you
should
want
to
be
an
actress
just
so
you
re
the
hell
of
a
good
actress
we
have
all
felt
a
compulsion
to
be
terrific
and
that
be
a
dangerous
thing
it
be
awfully
hard
for
us
really
to
give
our
best
to
something
low
small
unimportant
we
have
live
so
long
at
the
top
in
every
respect
that
it
be
hard
to
make
ourselves
really
at
home
with
root
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
and
that
be
the
only
way
we
will
ever
grow
if
any
of
us
do
to
be
able
to
climb
under
our
own
power
it
take
me
almost
a
month
to
reply
but
when
i
do
it
be
a
summation
of
what
i
be
think
about
work
the
family
the
post
and
in
particular
my
father
bi
kept
my
letter
and
return
it
to
me
decade
later
on
the
subject
of
meyerdom
i
have
plenty
to
say
even
though
i
don
t
pretend
to
understand
it
completely
either
its
cause
or
its
effect
it
can
be
compare
obviously
enough
with
an
octopus
whose
tentacle
stretch
far
and
wide
and
what
be
bad
of
all
deep
in
other
word
if
you
try
to
run
from
it
you
be
apt
to
find
it
within
more
concretely
this
be
the
way
it
be
work
itself
out
for
me
at
this
point
to
begin
somewhere
in
a
circular
situation
i
think
i
want
to
go
into
the
newspaper
business
this
be
because
i
have
certain
political
view
which
may
or
may
not
change
combine
with
the
fact
that
i
like
to
write
put
aside
an
unanswerable
question
at
this
time
my
ability
to
be
a
good
reporter
which
be
a
gift
give
by
god
to
a
very
few
i
mean
good
reporter
the
fact
remains
that
what
i
be
most
interested
in
do
be
labor
reporting
possibly
work
up
to
political
reporting
later
as
you
can
see
that
be
no
help
to
dad
he
want
and
need
someone
who
be
willing
to
go
through
the
whole
mill
from
reporting
to
circulation
management
and
problem
to
editorial
write
and
eventually
to
be
his
assistant
this
present
the
payoff
in
problem
one
i
detest
beyond
description
advertising
and
circulation
and
that
be
what
a
newspaper
executive
spends
most
of
his
time
worry
about
two
there
be
a
question
of
point
of
view
which
would
or
might
complicate
thing
if
i
be
to
work
under
dad
and
three
i
doubt
my
ability
to
carry
a
load
like
the
washington
post
and
four
i
know
dad
need
a
different
kind
of
person
much
more
of
an
automaton
under
him
and
five
i
damn
well
think
it
would
be
a
first
class
dog
s
life
discard
finally
for
a
moment
the
idea
of
ever
have
anything
to
do
with
the
w
post
there
be
more
theoretical
result
to
be
question
and
test
as
i
say
long
long
ago
at
the
begin
of
this
letter
meyer
tentacle
clutch
deep
from
dad
s
point
of
view
i
think
it
would
mean
something
i
may
be
flatter
myself
but
i
think
it
would
mean
several
thing
such
as
companionship
a
living
connection
with
the
next
generation
and
the
knowledge
that
all
that
he
be
slave
to
build
be
not
go
to
stop
with
him
from
my
point
of
view
it
would
be
give
up
a
position
that
it
be
fair
to
say
thousand
would
fight
for
that
be
an
influential
position
in
an
influential
paper
in
the
capital
of
the
world
s
most
important
country
right
now
anyway
besides
that
it
would
mean
lose
valuable
help
company
and
advice
which
have
already
influence
me
a
great
deal
and
which
i
respect
highly
if
i
find
for
some
reason
that
i
be
not
fit
to
do
newspaper
work
and
this
may
happen
as
among
other
thing
i
function
a
little
on
the
slow
side
which
be
not
good
i
shall
get
out
and
consider
it
no
disgrace
i
don
t
think
this
be
part
of
the
success
idea
because
by
fit
i
mean
simply
a
competent
not
scintillate
job
though
that
be
make
difficult
by
our
heritage
i
should
think
it
could
be
work
out
practically
though
i
can
t
tell
from
my
present
ivory
tower
window
and
someday
i
think
i
shall
marry
a
man
that
be
because
by
nature
i
do
not
like
to
live
alone
i
like
to
live
with
somebody
and
if
you
live
with
someone
it
be
nice
to
be
married
so
maybe
i
shall
devote
myself
as
flo
always
use
to
prophesy
with
hoot
of
mirth
to
have
sixteen
small
one
and
bring
them
up
to
be
unsuccessful
and
rather
animal
in
their
desire
with
as
little
as
possible
of
that
specialized
human
quality
call
the
rational
this
letter
seem
to
me
to
summarize
who
i
be
and
what
i
be
think
after
four
year
of
college
well
than
i
can
do
it
nearly
sixty
year
later
i
be
puzzle
that
i
have
such
reservation
about
work
for
my
father
in
view
of
the
continue
conversation
he
and
i
be
have
about
my
education
and
career
in
journalism
and
the
progress
of
the
post
i
suppose
the
answer
have
to
be
that
i
be
ambivalent
and
maybe
so
be
he
since
he
and
i
later
both
enthusiastically
endorse
my
husband
s
go
on
the
post
and
my
go
off
to
lead
the
life
of
wife
mother
and
good
work
my
stay
at
the
university
of
chicago
this
noble
institution
as
i
refer
to
it
to
my
parent
end
in
early
june
of
my
mark
throughout
my
tenure
at
chicago
be
not
as
good
or
as
bad
in
some
case
as
they
might
have
be
i
didn
t
think
it
matter
particularly
since
i
felt
i
have
learn
a
lot
during
my
two
year
there
there
seem
to
have
be
no
discussion
about
my
parent
come
to
whatever
graduation
formality
there
be
i
don
t
believe
i
thought
of
graduation
as
a
momentous
event
but
the
fact
that
my
parent
didn
t
come
have
be
built
into
a
trauma
in
various
account
in
one
of
which
i
be
portrayed
as
weep
i
can
t
in
fact
remember
why
they
didn
t
come
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
can
t
remember
attend
the
graduation
of
my
own
child
perhaps
i
inherit
delinquency
in
this
respect
or
perhaps
the
sixty
generation
turn
their
back
on
this
kind
of
event
we
graduate
in
the
beautiful
rockefeller
built
chapel
the
ceremony
preside
over
by
president
hutchins
and
then
after
party
with
my
friend
and
with
my
formal
education
behind
me
i
left
chicago
for
mount
kisco
and
a
fairly
uncertain
future
chapter
six
while
i
be
home
after
graduate
my
father
suggest
that
i
accompany
him
to
california
land
of
his
youth
i
scarcely
knew
the
california
branch
of
my
family
but
i
quickly
fell
in
love
with
them
and
with
san
francisco
as
well
its
beauty
and
its
people
the
civic
feel
the
friendliness
the
informality
very
soon
i
come
to
think
that
it
would
be
wonderful
to
work
in
such
a
congenial
atmosphere
and
beautiful
environment
so
i
resolve
to
try
to
stay
i
told
my
father
that
if
he
would
help
me
find
a
job
there
i
would
swallow
my
pride
and
give
up
a
job
i
have
earlier
get
for
myself
in
chicago
there
be
four
newspaper
in
san
francisco
at
that
time
in
the
morning
the
chronicle
be
the
predominant
and
most
respect
voice
the
competition
be
hearst
s
examiner
the
best
and
strong
hearst
paper
of
a
then
still
vibrant
empire
the
two
afternoon
paper
exemplify
typical
old
fashion
razzle
dazzle
street
sale
journalism
bursting
with
huge
headline
late
break
story
and
much
more
sex
and
crime
than
the
morning
paper
my
father
call
his
friend
george
deke
parker
of
scripps
howard
and
it
be
on
their
paper
the
san
francisco
news
that
he
found
me
a
two
month
job
our
competitor
in
the
afternoon
be
another
hearst
paper
the
call
bulletin
i
be
surprised
that
my
father
didn
t
turn
to
his
friend
on
the
chronicle
the
well
know
and
more
traditional
paper
but
the
news
turn
out
to
be
a
great
blessing
for
me
because
it
be
a
typically
informal
understaffed
rowdy
scrappy
amuse
afternoon
tabloid
ideal
for
a
beginner
break
in
since
it
afford
me
opportunity
i
couldn
t
have
have
in
a
more
structure
orderly
atmosphere
but
thing
didn
t
start
out
all
that
happily
i
go
to
the
city
room
know
no
one
and
bad
not
know
the
element
of
the
job
i
hadn
t
do
much
type
and
certainly
not
much
reporting
i
didn
t
know
the
city
or
how
to
get
around
in
it
everything
seem
so
suddenly
overwhelm
i
sat
down
at
my
desk
and
be
gripped
by
fear
of
failure
lose
and
defeat
before
i
d
begin
my
father
have
stayed
over
a
few
day
and
i
go
to
his
room
one
night
and
in
tear
told
him
that
i
be
afraid
i
d
bitten
off
more
than
i
could
chew
that
i
felt
unable
to
do
the
job
and
would
be
of
little
use
to
the
paper
certainly
not
worth
the
a
week
i
be
be
paid
and
that
i
want
to
go
home
with
him
dad
say
simply
that
everyone
have
to
learn
that
maybe
i
should
take
some
more
time
before
decide
to
give
up
the
job
and
that
if
i
wasn
t
worth
the
whole
a
week
now
i
d
be
worth
much
more
than
that
later
since
i
would
gradually
learn
the
thing
i
be
so
discourage
about
now
what
persuade
me
i
m
not
sure
but
i
agree
to
stay
know
i
could
always
give
up
later
just
one
short
month
after
my
tearful
desire
to
run
away
my
new
life
have
become
lot
of
fun
by
mid
august
i
be
begin
to
feel
that
there
be
more
ups
than
down
a
touch
of
ambition
be
take
hold
and
i
could
see
far
ahead
than
the
next
paragraph
i
realize
that
not
just
the
news
but
san
francisco
itself
be
a
good
place
for
me
to

care
most
people
in
fact
have
never
heard
of

up
after

interested
me
and
ask
if
i
would
like

store
i
respond
with
a
vigorous
and
enthusiastic
assent
and
thus
begin
a
long
story
that
absorbed
me
for
many
week
in
the
san
francisco
waterfront
and
with
many
of
the
major
figure
involve
in

at
the
time
i
begin
work
on

and
whipsaw
against
each
other
by
this
increasingly
powerful
union
get
together
and
decide
to
exert
their
united
front
by
lock
out
the
ilwu
so
they
could
negotiate
a
master
contract
for
the
whole

occur
at
the
woolworth

a
result
one
of
my
job
as
a
reporter
on
this
story
be
to
follow
the
hot
car
on
its
journey
along
the
waterfront
observe
each
warehouse
on
which
it
call

sam
kagel
a
highly
successful
negotiator
for
the
ilwu
who
have
no

people
luckily
for
me
however
of
all
the
paper
cover
the
waterfront
he
disliked
the
news
least
think
it
be
the
fairest

antiunion
press
the

by
another
very
strong
leader
eugene
patton
one
of
a
huge
and
authentic
waterfront
family
all
of
whom
have
grown
up
there
and
earn
their
living
on
the
ship
or
around
the
harbor
patton
or
pat
as
he
be
know
everywhere
be
a
wonderfully
romantic
figure
smart
funny
and
intuitive
though
uneducated
in
any
formal
sense
he
be
a
brave
leader
and
a
charismatic
one
each
of
these
player
say
that
i
could
make
myself
at
home
in
his
office
and
that
if
there
be
development
he
would
inform
me
they
all
get
together
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
trade
information
and
unwind
usually
at
a
bar
at
the
foot
of
sacramento
street
and
i
begin
go
along
with
kagel
patton
and
occasionally
harry
bridge
i
spent
many
hour
up
and
down
the
waterfront
in
one
of
the
twenty
or
more
small
dark
bar
within
a
three
block
area
we
use
to
get
boilermakers
a
glass
of
beer
and
a
shot
of
whiskey
at
twenty
five
cent
each
if
you
bought
two
you
get
the
third
one
free
pretty
heady
stuff
for
a
twenty
one
year
old
we
all
become
great
friend
in
fact
in
a
most
unprofessional
manner
i
realize
now
pat
and
i
become
more
than
friend
he
be
an
early
romance
of
mine
we
really
like
each
other
he
be
not
only
highly
intelligent
but
very
good
look
some
week
after
we
met
i
realize
that
he
be
married
i
also
realize
that
he
have
a
serious
drinking
problem
his
courage
and
extraordinary
leadership
ability
reveal
themselves
during
world
war
ii
when
in
the
battle
of
the
bulge
he
be
promote
from
a
private
to
an
officer
after
all
his
officer
have
be
kill
and
he
take
charge
unfortunately
after
the
war
he
go
on
with
his
hard
living
and
drinking
and
eventually
commit
suicide
by
leap
off
the
golden
gate
bridge
i
have
carefully
guard
my
identity
and
be
merely
view
by
the
labor
leader
as
the
reporter
from
the
news
until
my
allot
time
at
the
paper
be
about
to
expire
patton
have
make
some
reference
to
future
plan
and
i
say
i
wasn
t
sure
i
d
be
there
why
he
say
be
they
go
to
fire
you
not
exactly
i
respond
and
then
told
them
i
have
be
hire
only
for
two
month
at
the
request
of
my
father
who
be
an
eastern
publisher
they
want
to
know
who
he
be
of
course
and
what
the
paper
be
when
i
told
them
they
be
momentarily
surprised
and
puzzle
but
accepted
it
and
we
go
on
as
usual
it
be
lucky
that
they
knew
of
my
connection
to
the
post
because
later
melnikow
a
somewhat
humorless
and
paranoid
figure
say
to
them
be
careful
we
have
a
spy
in
our
midst
somehow
he
have
found
out
that
i
be
the
daughter
of
a
capitalist
and
therefore
suspect

gain
after

rather
stationary
period
we
be
at
and
hop
to
reach
before
the
rise
abate
although
i
rarely

to
read
the
whole
paper
the
post
do
look
well
to
me
all
the
time
my

as
a
slender
reed
for

lean
on
in
fact
she
be
struck
by
the
lack
of
virility
on
the
part
of
a
number
of
the
world
s
suppose
leader
and
conclude
that
if
democracy

would
have
to
save
it

of
much
of
mother
s
energy
throughout
the
late
s
and
early
s
mann
awed
her
but
she
felt
she
surprised
him
a
little
too
somebody
once
ask
him
if
my
mother
be
german
to
which
he
reply
oh
yes
very
she
be
a
valkyrian
type
with
something
else
a
mixture
of
valkyrie
and
juno
she
be
so
pleased
with
this
description
that
she
thought
it
ought
to
be
put
in

for
her
grandchild
so
here
it
be
the
mann
often
visit
my

and
mount
kisco
i
met
him
on
one
of
the
early
visit
in
and
be
disappointed
for
i
thought
him
cold
unfeeling
and
hard
to
talk
to
but
mother
worship
him
she
write
me
he
be
the
big
thing
i
ever
met
bar
nothing
though
my
father
live
fairly
amicably
and
generally
uncomplainingly
with
most
of
my
mother
s
male
friend
he
get
rather
tire
of
be
left
with
mann
s
wife
while
the
two
spouse
go
off
into
intellectual
discussion
most
often
conduct
in
german
she
adore
mann
openly
but
he
return
her
adoration
diffidently
nonetheless
she
still
have
the
feel
i
be
one
of
the
few
people
and
one
of
the
very
few
woman
he
have
ever
like
in
truth
the
real
passion
seem
to
be
on
her
side
only
mann
have
be
described
by
one
of
his
biographer
donald
prater
as
a
cold
nature
with
a
complete
lack
of

and
of
real
feel
for
others
accord
to
prater
mann
tend
to
exploit
people
for
his
personal
convenience
he
may
well
have
cold
bloodedly
maintain
the
relationship
because

to
the
plethora
of
honor
shower
on
him
in
the

my
play
no
matter
how
immerse
i
be
in
the
latter
two
it
be
hard
to
forget
that
so
much
hinge
on
event
in
europe
even
though
europe
seem
much
more
remote
from
california
than
it
have
from
the
east
coast
i
listen
one
morning
to
a
speech
by
hitler
and
write
afterwards
that
the
broadcast
sound
a
little
bit
as
though
you
have
gotten
the
zoo
by
mistake
that
rasp
voice
punctuate
by
roar
that
sound
like
a
pack
of
insane
animal
the
more
serious
the
situation
abroad
become
the
more
i
thought
it
important
to
work
terribly
hard
to
learn
the
game
well
not
that
i
thought
i
or
any
individual
could
make
a
difference
but
i
thought
i
d
go
mad
if
i
wasn
t
do
as
much
as
i
could
in
my
own
little
rut
as
the
labor
story
wound
down
i
look
forward
to
write
again
the
routine
activity
involve
in
be
a
legman
and
get
kick
around
be
lot
of
fun
after
the
highly
theoretical
existence
i
d
be
lead
in
chicago
but
i
be
ready
to
start
become
a
reporter
initially
i
cover
sob
sister
stuff
a
little
girl
whose
christmas

interview
with
a
woman
who
in
a
fit
of
despondency
because
her
husband
didn
t
love
her
anymore
try
to
choke
her
baby
the
news
from
europe
be
crowd
out
of
the
san
francisco
paper
by
a
first
class
sex
murder
with
a
beautiful
blonde
corpse
one
brush
with
crime
reporting
come
when
i
be
sent
out
with
a
photographer
to
cover
a
distinctly
unglamorous
incident
a
garbage
truck
empty
its
content
at
the
city
dump
have
turn
up
a
corpse
a

who
have
be
dead
at

a
week
my
prayer
be
answer
when
the
undertaker
arrive
just
before
we
do
make
off
with
the
corpse
and
save
me
from
the
grisly
spectacle
not
my
story
but
that
of
another
reporter
be
the
discovery
of
a
lady
brutally
murder
her
breast
cut
off
across
her
torso
with
her
lipstick
have
be
write
honey
i
love
you
my
mother
sympathize
with
my
assignment
deplore
the
way
ugly
thing
rest
in
the
mind
in
her
inimitable
fashion
she
suggest
i
apply
schopenhauer
s
rule
of
objectivity
unhinge
the
will
until
you
feel
neither
hate
nor
fear
my
progress
at
work
be
uneven
a
series
of
ups
and
down
every
once
in
a
while
i
thought
i
be
catch
on
to
the
art
of
write
a
news
story
yet
even
when
i
felt
i
might
be
get
the
hang
of
it
in
term
of
speed
and
efficiency
the
top
still
seem
so
terribly
far
away
efficiency
be
my
special
bugaboo
every
time
i
do
something
stupid
i
could
hear
my
french
governess
s
voice
resound
through
the
year
say
etourdie
veux
tu
mettre
le
accent
scatterbrain
will
you
put
on
the
accent
here
i
be
year
later
still
forget
to
put
the
accent
on
i
fear
get
scoop
but
so
far
it
hadn
t
happen
i
go
on
worry
that
i
might
be
hang
on
that
i
mightn
t
have
be
kept
on
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
my
name
but
then
think
back
to
my
first
day
i
remember
the
hour
it
have
take
me
to
write
a
three
line
item
and
felt
encourage
by
have
in
just
one
day
write
two
half
column
story
cover
a
wool
grower
convention
and
a
fire
and
write
the
weekly
church
column
that
always
get
foist
on
some
poor
sucker
the
news
chronically
short
of
staff
be
particularly
so
while
i
be
there
and
i
be
always
tire
by
even
when
i
rode
home
on
the
cable
car
my
final
story
for
the
paper
be
the
opening
of
the
golden
gate
international
exposition
on
san
francisco
s
treasure
island
celebrate
the
new
golden
gate
bridge
and
the
oakland
bay
bridge
i
cover
the
exposition
all
day
and
go
out
at
night
with
an
architect
friend
bill
wurster
who
have
design
the
art
building
for
it
in
the
spring
of
my
father
come
out
to
visit
and
remind
me
that
i
have
say
i
be
go
to
come
back
to
work
on
the
post
in
fact
his
visit
come
at
a
propitious
moment
the
news
be
go
through
yet
another
of
its
economy
drive
and
it
seem
clear
that
someone
would
be
let
go
in
which
case
i
the
junior
person
be
the
likely
candidate
besides
i
be
worried
about
take
someone
s
job
who
need
it
so
i
agree
with
my
father
that
i
would
return
to
washington
not
exactly
reluctantly
but
not
without
mixed
feeling
and
a
certain
sense
of
loss
i
love
those
month
i
spent
in
san
francisco
as
i
have
love
few
time
in
my
life
on
april
my
photo

in
time

the
brief

with
a
note
there
be
no

in
california
come
back
to
us
chapter
seven
come
back
to
washington
after
nearly
five
year
away
at
college
and
in
san
francisco
i
found
a
new
city
i
have
no
idea
how
much
washington
have
change
since
i
d
left
for
vassar
there
be
an
intellectually
excite
atmosphere
a
sea
change
from
the
washington
i
have
left
behind
in
i
be
happily
surprised
indeed
thrill
by
this
new
city
alive
with
energetic
dynamic
young
people
from
the
stodgy
town
i
d
know
where
a
small
group
of
old
people
be
the
establishment
and
saw
each
other
constantly
at
very
formal
dinner
and
the
young
people
be
set
in
a
different
but
equally
boring
routine
there
have
sprung
a
young
person
s
ideal
place
there
have
be
two
period
in
my
lifetime
when
the
excitement
of
government
and
of
public
issue
drew
to
washington
many
of
the
bright
young
people
graduate
from
college
and
law
school
these
be
essentially
the
roosevelt
and
the
kennedy
year
in
the
time
i
d
be
mostly
go
large
number
of
these
able
idealistic
young
men
and
woman
have
come
to
town
ready
to
help
institute
reform
to
get
the
economy
work
again
to
guarantee
certain
benefit
to
those
without
job
or
social
security
to
those
in
retirement
or
minimum
wage
to
those
with
low
pay
job
it
be
a
moment
when
youth
could
accomplish
a
lot
when
idea
percolate
up
and
be
listen
to
by
those
in
authority
against
this
backdrop
in
april
of
i
go
to
work
on
the
post
i
felt
it
unwise
to
try
to
be
a
reporter
back
in
washington
since
it
would
be
awkward
be
the
publisher
s
daughter
so
it
be
agree
that
i
would
become
an
editorial
page
employee
work
that
be
very
different
from
what
i
have
be
do
in
san
francisco
i
now
work
for
the
editorial
page
editor
felix
morley
the
editorial
team
with
me
quite
the
junior
member
met
every
morning
to
discus
the
issue
of
the
day
assignment
be
make
base
on
an
individual
s
particular
expertise
morley
save
the
big
domestic
and
international
issue
for
himself
by
the
president
s
energy
be
concentrate
on
unite
the
country
on
event
abroad
this
meant
abandon
most
of
the
new
deal
program
except
for
those
already
in
place
so
the
post
s
editorial
and
news
begin
to
be
more
in
sync
with
the
administration
the
paper
fiercely
back
preparedness
in
this
country
as
early
as
april
when
roosevelt
casually
say
as
he
be
leave
warm
spring
georgia
i
ll
be
back
in
the
fall
if
we
don
t
have
a
war
the
post
s
editorial
page
lead
with
in
use
the
collective
we
the
president
told
hitler
and
mussolini
that
the
tremendous
force
of
the
united
state
must
be
a
factor
in
their
current
think
roosevelt
told
reporter
that
this
so
represent
his
think
he
have
almost
fall
out
of
bed
when
he
read
it
on
september
the
day
the
german
army
invade
poland
barnet
barney
nover
one
of
my
editorial
colleague
and
i
go
together
to
president
roosevelt
s
press
conference
in
the
oval
office
the
fact
that
he
could
take
me
an
unaccredited
journalist
to
the
white
house
now
seem
amaze
at
that
time
the
president
s
press
conference
generally
consist
of
a
small
group
of
mostly
men
stand
around
the
president
s
desk
listen
to
him
talk
bantering
and
ask
a
few
question
on
this
day
it
be
a
large
and
more
solemn
group
barney
and
i
be
there
early
and
so
be
fairly
close
to
the
president
s
desk
in
his
diary
barney
note
the
tone
of
the
meeting
there
be
a
tense
feel
of
sobriety
and
solemnity
at
the
conference
the
president
make
a
very
good
impression
when
we
left
kate
say
she
couldn
t
help
be
impressed
by
him
and
i
say
that
whatever
his
fault
roosevelt
be
superb
in
an
emergency
by
this
time
the
strain
between
morley
s
view
that
we
must
stay
out
of
the
war
and
my
father
s
opposite
view
that
we
have
to
help
the
ally
and
if
necessary
get
in
reach
a
climax
morley
resign
the
follow
spring
and
it
be
announce
in
august
that
he
would
become
president
of
haverford
college
my
friend
and
i
be
all
exultant
that
the
rift
have
finally
cause
morley
to
depart
so
commit
be
we
all
to
help
the
ally
be
young
we
couldn
t
understand
why
it
have
take
my
father
so
long
to
see
the
light
the
transition
however
be
fairly
smooth
my
father
first
try
to
hire
elmer
davis
a
popular
news
radio
broadcaster
but
in
the
end
he
settle
for
a
recommendation
of
morley
s
herbert
elliston

editor
for

turn
at

around

time
of
the
changeover
from

move
over

for
a
year
there

to
meet

and
to
deepen
my
friendship
with

be
fair
weapon
in

in

there

no

despite
the
wide
variety
of
political
opinion
john

even
their
liberal
housemate
abandon
them
prich

be
indeed
very
liberal
but
they
also
enjoy
espouse
unpopular
cause
they
have
sympathy
with
the
soviet
union
but
in
the
case
of
finland
they
be
essentially
push
the
argument
more
for
the
exercise
than
from
belief
they

in
no

about

worth

constant
acceptance
of
their
hospitality

ever
write
a

or

of

the
flat
face

the
party
be
a
great
success
with
lot
of
laughter
and
the
usual
loud
raucous
argument
at
one
point
i
found
myself
seat
on
a
bench
next
to
phil
whom
i
knew
probably
the
least
of
all
the
boy
and
be
startle
when
he
turn
to
me
look
at
my
sister
bi
and
ask
be
we
for
her
this
question
be
typical
of
phil
in
several
respect
it
be
instant
penetration
of
the
human
armor
it
cut
through
formality
and
reach
you
directly
it
create
a
sort
of
charm
circle
enclose
you
and
him
in
an
intimate
association
and
it
ask
a
central
and
real
question
typically
his
question
elicit
a
frank
answer
in
which
i
say
everything
i
felt
about
bi
include
the
ambivalence
the
admiration
and
the
envy
but
the
bottom
line
answer
be
yes
we
be
for
her
suddenly
with
just
one
question
ask
and
answer
phil
and
i
knew
each
other
the
last
of
us
to
leave
the
party
pile
into
the
remain
car
and
i
found
myself
on
phil
s
lap
the
whole
way
to
town
get
to
know
him
even
well
a
couple
of
week
later
early
in
the
new
year
of
i
be
invite
by
prich
to
sunday
lunch
at
the
ritz
carlton
there
be
several
of
us
and
after
we
have
lunch
as
long
as
we
could
someone
suggest
drive
to
the
scene
of
the
happy
new
year
s
party
the
cabin
and
we
spent
the
afternoon
there
at
the
end
of
the
day
everyone
except
phil
and
me
have
engagement
so
he
ask
if
i
want
to
have
dinner
we
go
to
a
little
know
restaurant
have
a
long
dinner
talk
and
laugh
a
lot
and
drank
until
quite
late
when
he
take
me
home
i
enjoy
it
but
i
also
realize
that
we
have
be
the
only
two
without
date
and
that
he
have
ask
me
for
that
reason
so
i
still
felt
a
reserve
phil
call
me
once
or
twice
and
carry
on
in
his
usual
irreverent
breezy
way
i
found
him
captivate
by
then
alice
barry
and
he
have
go
their
separate
way
i
ve
always
thought
she
be
too
proper
to
have
ever
consider
phil
seriously
but
in
the
early
day
at
hockley
she
ask
me
if
i
knew
him
when
i
say
no
not
really
she
say
you
ought
to
he
s
the
best
here
the
second
week
in
february
phil
call
me
at
work
late
one
afternoon
suggest
we
have
dinner
with
one
of
his
college
roommate
george
smathers
and
his
wife
rosemary
i
say
i
couldn
t
for
several
reason
it
be
my
night
to
proofread
the
editorial
and
op
ed
page
and
on
top
of
that
i
didn
t
feel
well
and
fear
i
be
get
the
flu
in
addition
i
wasn
t
dress
for
dinner
i
look
as
rotten
as
i
felt
in
a
simple
brown
wool
dress
cotton
stocking
and
loafer
so
i
be
firm
in
my
regret
phil
be
equally
firm
in
his
insistence
he
point
out
that
we
would
eat
at
harvey
s
a
famous
old
seafood
restaurant
next
door
to
the
mayflower
where
we
could
buy
the
early
edition
of
the
post
he
would
help
me
proofread
the
page
and
we
could
call
in
the
correction
it
didn
t
matter
how
i
look
he
persist
and
no
doubt
this
dinner
would
chase
away
all
my
symptom
which
in
any
case
be
not
prevent
me
from
work
so
i
give
in
and
join
him
after
make
up
the
page
embarrass
and
discomfit
when
i
walk
in
to
find
george
and
rosemary
smathers
look
incredibly
handsome
and
impeccably
dress
for
the
occasion
the
even
however
be
fine
and
fun
phil
drove
me
home
and
we
talk
for
a
long
time
he
told
me
that
he
love
me
and
say
we
would
be
married
and
go
to
florida
if
i
could
live
with
only
two
dress
because
i
have
to
understand
that
he
would
never
take
anything
from
my
father
or
be
involve
with
him
and
we
would
live
on
what
he
make
my
breath
be
take
away
i
be
to
put
it
mildly
startle
this
be
a
little
ahead
of
where
i
be
but
not
that
much
ahead
i
agree
that
it
sound
like
quite
a
good
idea
but
perhaps
a
bit
rash
and
that
we
should
put
the
idea
of
marriage
on
hold
for
all
of
a
month
or
so
while
we
deliberate
and
consider
phil
agree
to
the
month
s
delay
it
all
seem
so
odd
in
retrospect
a
fast
month
of
deliberate
hesitation
pass
and
in
reality
it
hardly
occur
it
seem
to
be
a
give
to
both
of
us
that
although
we
be
try
to
be
discreet
thing
be
move
forward
in
fact
the
night
of
the
smathers
dinner
phil
whistle
happily
have
return
to
the
room
at
hockley
he
share
with
prich
prich
already
long
in
bed
turn
over
look
at
phil
and
in
the
throe
of
his
momentary
crush
on
me
say
you
son
of
a
bitch
you
ve
get
her
prich
go
into
a
month
long
pout
a
real
anger
during
which
he
once
threw
his
drink
at
us
he
finally
emerge
as
our
best
man
despite
my
hesitation
the
fact
be
i
be
charm
and
dazzle
and
i
be
incredulous
this
brilliant
charismatic
fascinate
man
love
me
even
in
my
excitement
over
the
sudden
and
unexpected
development
and
quite
apart
from
his
magnetism
i
saw
at
once
that
the
combination
of
quality
i
have
hop
for
in
any
possible
man
have
surprisingly
and
actually
come
together
in
this
one
here
be
someone
who
combine
for
me
the
two
part
of
my
life
that
i
thought
be
inescapably
separate
for
the
first
time
i
have
found
a
man
who
be
that
right
mix
of
intellectual
physical
and
social
charm
and
warm
and
funny
on
top
of
that
phil
be
bright
issue
orient
hardworking
witty
and
to
me
amazingly
good
look
with
his
leanness
and
angularity
make
him
much
more
interest
and
appeal
to
me
than
classic
good
look
he
love
me
and
i
love
him
it
be
incredibly
excite
the
morning
after
our
proclamation
of
love
my
bad
flu
fear
be
realize
i
have
a
roar

and

and
told
me
to

and
phil
sent
a
funny
bouquet
of
yellow
daffodil
and
red
tulip
with
a
cupid
and
an
arrow

by
a

the
sender
arrive
in
the
late
afternoon
and
sat
on
my
bed
for
hour
as
we
talk
and
talk
that
month
my
mother
be
away
with
bi
in
nassau
phil
come
and
go
either
visit
or
pick
me
up
often
enough
to
cause
my
father
to
be
suspicious
about
us
he
and
i
be
travel
to
new
york
talk
about
young
men
and
what
their
current
interest
be
i
told
him
that
the
young
men
i
knew
be
mostly
lawyer
many
of
them
do
government
work
he
ask
me
who
be
the
most
interest
of
these
and
i
naturally
begin
describe
phil
without
altogether
consider
what
i
be
do
i
must
have
make
quite
an
impression
with
my
characterization
because
my
father
ask
be
you
serious
the
agree
on
month
be
not
over
but
i
say
yes
i
thought
i
be
my
father
promptly
say
that
in
that
case
he
would
like
to
know
phil
and
ask
me
to
invite
him
to
dinner
i
be
surprised
i
have
wad
into
this
but
didn
t
blame
my
father
for
his
natural
curiosity
i
call
phil
confess
the
conversation
and
ask
if
he
mind
be
look
over
with
some
trepidation
he
agree
he
make
no
bone
about
regard
my
father
as
a
wealthy
ogre
who
might
want
to
entangle
an
unsuspecting
young
son
in
law
in
his
tentacle
he
have
never
before
encounter
this
kind
of
wealth
and
power
and
be
darkly
suspicious
i
ask
two
other
friend
to
dinner
also
to
make
thing
impersonal
and
less
intense
phil
arrive
and
one
of
the
first
thing
my
father
do
be
to
show
him
an
old
cartoon
by
the
post
s
talented
cartoonist
gene
elderman
it
have
to
do
with
justice
hugo
black
who
in
the
course
of
his
confirmation
hearing
have
be
reveal
as
once
have
be
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
there
be
a
figure
of
black
on
the
court
in
klan
robe
with
the
title
reform
of
the
judiciary
phil
s
response
be
well
that
s
a
very
good
draw
and
a
clever
one
but
i
disagree
with
its
message
i
happen
to
think
justice
black
be
one
of
the
ablest
and
hardest
work
member
of
the
court
and
one
of
its
fine
mind
the
room
be
almost
envelop
in
smoke
my
heart
sank
as
the
argument
grow
louder
and
longer
continue
most
of
the
even
when
the
guest
finally
left
i
say
morosely
to
my
father
that
it
seem
to
have
be
an
unfortunate
occasion
what
do
you
mean
my
father
inquire
i
have
a
wonderful
time
and
like
him
fine
i
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
and
inform
phil
that
he
have
pass
my
mother
return
from
her
trip
a
few
evening
later
and
join
the
family
in
time
for

she
be
describe
her
trip
when
my
father
interrupt
her
to
say

be

for
dinner
fine
she
reply
and
go
on
talk
don
t
you
want
to
know
why
we
be
have
champagne
for
dinner
my
father
persevere
without
a
moment
s
pause
she
look
up
and
ask
excitedly
cissy
s

out
of

say
my
father
kay
s
engage
to
be
married
oh

whole
whirlwind
romance
have
essentially
occur
while
she
be

typically
i
have
told
her
nothing
about

have
met
phil
only
in
large
crowd
of

go
on
hang
out
at
the
race
and
in
bar
even
so
he
do
well
and
thrive
in
the
new
environment
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
he
be
afraid
that
the
all
important
final
exam
have
do
him
in
he
told
his
father
he
have
let
him
down
after
his
sacrifice
in
send
him
to
law
school
he
thought
he
might
have
flunk
when
his
mark
arrive
his
father
say
i
guess
you
didn
t
flunk
it
say
here
you
be
third
in
your
class
from
that
position
phil
make
the
law
review
and
at
the
end
of
his
second
year
become
its
president
this
be
undoubtedly
one
of
those
crucial
event
that
make
all
the
difference
in
a
person
s
life
it
brought
him
a
new
intellectual
stimulus
it
taught
him
a
lot
it
raise
his
profile
from
fairly
invisible
to
very
visible
and
it
introduce
him
to
felix
frankfurter
one
of
the
great
influence
on
his
life
two
young
men
be
ahead
of
phil
as
potential
president
of
the
review
their
rivalry
succeed
in
defeat
both
of
them
and
create
a
deadlock
so
in
the
small
hour
of
the
morning
the
editor
turn
to
phil
who
be
relatively
unknown
and
belong
neither
to
the
grind
nor
to
the
ivy
league
elite
prich
later
say
they
go
and
haul
phil
out
of
a
bar
and
make
him
president
of
the
law
review
soon
after
this
ed
huddleson
the
previous
year
s
president
told
phil
he
have
to
meet
felix
as
they
be
leave
for
the
meeting
phil
be
puzzle
to
see
huddleson
race
through
the
page
of
the
new
york
time
and
ask
what
he
be
do
ed
say
he
be
prepare
himself
to
reply
to
all
the
question
the
little
so
and
so
will
want
to
discus
so
much
of
phil
s
life
flow
from
the
year
as
president
of
the
law
review
and
from
his
relationship
with
felix
frankfurter
felix
adopt
phil
as
one
of
his
boy
before
he
be
appoint
by
president
roosevelt
to
the
supreme
court
in
january
the
middle
of
phil
s
last
year
in
law
school
it
be
with
felix
and
with
new
friend
from
the
review
that
phil
enter
the
world
of
great
mind
idea
and
book
stimulate
conversation
and
above
all
an
interest
in
current
event
phil
have
always
love
politics
and
have
spent
year
campaign
with
his
father
so
he
have
developed
an
interest
in
public
issue
but
now
he
d
met
a
man
obsess
with
the
national
and
international
scene
with
the
us
of
power
and
idea
with
people
and

and
political
theory
chapter
eight
the
spring
of
be
spent
in
a
haze
of
excitement
and
romance
it
be
a
wonderful
time
for
both
of
us
but
it
be
also
quite
crazy
to
think
about
get
married
so
quickly
i
suppose
i
have
the
usual
nervousness
about
marriage
phil
and
i
knew
each
other
relatively
little
and
we
be
both
very
young
not
quite
twenty
three
and
twenty
five
we
come
from
such
different
background
but
have
so
much
in
common
humor
friend
interest
enthusiasm
and
political
view
there
be
a
great
deal
go
for
us
even
though
the
complexity
be
not
understood
or
address
really
ever
since
phil
be
go
to
be
justice
frankfurter
s
law
clerk
the
follow
supreme
court
term
he
drove
the
justice
home
from
the
court
one
night
and
told
him
of
our
decision
to
be
married
and
even
ask
his
permission
for
there
have
be
an
unwritten
rule
that
the
law
clerk
remain
single
so
as
to
be
at
the
complete
service
of
the
justice
day
or
night
by
this
time
that
tradition
have
broken
down
but
phil
still
felt
the
need
to
ask
phil
later
told
his
father
about
felix
s
reaction
say
that
frankfurter
be
in
fact
the
only
one
who
could
effectively
disapprove
so
i
talk
to
him
first
and
instead
of
disapprove
he
be
since
he
unlike
you
know
the
gal
heartily
in
favor
indeed
felix
have
be
a
friend
of
my
family
s
and
therefore
have
know
me
for
year
accord
to
phil
felix
remind
him
that
the
apple
never
fall
very
far
from
the
tree
tell
his
own
father
about
the
upcoming
marriage
prove
to
be
more
difficult
than
tell
felix
or
my
father
and
more
painful
phil
write
to
his
father
on
march
inadvertently
and
in
his
nervousness
date
the
letter
and
misspell
my
name
this
should
be
a
very
interest
letter
for
you
to
read
when
the
court
s
work
be
over
may
th
or
soon
thereafter
i
be
go
to
get
married
i
know
you
ll
be
in
favor
her
name
be
katherine
meyer
and
i
ve
not
a
doubt
in
the
world
that
you
ll
love
her
you
probably
have
heard
of
her
father
eugene
meyer
who
be
now
publisher
of
the
washington
post
and
have
be
in
the
past
such
thing
as
head
of
the
federal
reserve
he
be
a
jew
a
republican
and
rich
as
hell
for
the
last
two
factor
i
be
not
especially
fond
of
him
the
first
seem
immaterial
to
me
but
i
pas
it
on
to
you
her
mother
happens
to
be
a
gentile
she
be
one
of
the
first
newspaperwoman
in
this
country
be
credit
with
be
quite
brilliant
and
i
find
her
rather
unattractive
before
we
get
around
to
discuss
kay
katherine
this
be
about
enough
to
mention
about
the
family
except
possibly
to
reemphasize
the
terrible
fact
that
they
be
lousy
rich
for
instance
they
live
in
an
absurdly
huge
vulgar
castle
here
have
another
in
ny
have
a
ranch
in
wyoming
etc
now
we
shall
get
around
to
kay
she
really
be
about
as
wonderful
a
person
as
you
ll
ever
hope
to
see
of
course
i
can
t
write
you
why
this
be
so
but
i
ll
just
jot
down
a
few
very
factual
thing
about
her
then
when
we
drop
in
on
you
this
summer
you
ll
begin
to
catch
on
to
what
i
meant
we
ve
know
each
other
since
last
fall
and
finally
decide
the
hell
with
it
all
we
be
go
to
shove
off
this
summer
as
i
say
before
i
can
t
write
you
why
yet
i
ve
no
doubt
you
ll
understand
naturally
there
be
a
few
problem
but
i
think
we
ve
dealt
with
most
of
them
in
the
first
place
i
thought
there
might
be
a
problem
about
florida
i
of
course
want
to
go
back
and
though
you
may
not
understand
this
there
be
lot
of
girl
who
have
be
raise
around
here
who
wouldn
t
consider
this
in
any
event
this
turn
out
to
be
very
little
of
a
problem
for
she
be
quite
willing
to
test
florida
s
willingness
to
feed
me
next
and
a
little
tougher
be
the
problem
of
her
dough
and
i
think
we
ve
get
that
work
out
it
happens
that
she
have
a
pretty
horrible
hunk
of
it
in
her
name
and
we
have
work
out
this
solution
we
ll
live
in
the
sort
of
house
have
the
sort
of
furniture
eat
the
sort
of
food
go
to
the
sort
of
place
that
young
people
make
salary
like
mine
can
afford
if
she
want
to
spend
some
of
hers
on
special
clothes
or
special
trip
etc
for
herself
she
will
do
so
but
none
of
it
will
go
for
the
sort
of
joint
expense
that
ordinary
young
husband
pay
mainly
we
hope
she
ll
use
her
gold
by
way
of
help
thing
and
project
she
believe
in
about
the
only
problem
we
could
possibly
have
besides
these
be
ff
you
and
her
family
ff
we
have
already
take
care
of
i
hope
this
will
line
you
up
on
our
side
and
we
don
t
expect
any
trouble
from
her
family
that
we
can
t
handle
this
i
think
just
about
wind
up
all
i
can
write
about
kay
and
why
we
re
come
what
may
go
to
get
married
this
summer
ernie
upset
phil
at
first
by
resist
the
idea
of
his
marry
me
there
be
some
talk
of
my
be
jewish

one
day

protectively
indignant
the
other
issue
that

ernie

s
wealth
whether

might
retell
how
your
mother
and

and
get

i
say

ernie
eventually

a
sweet
letter
say
phil
have
displayed
the
best
judgment
that
he

i
will
just

didn
t
invite
his

part

be
angry
over

large
house
and
number
of

the
way

have
shock
him
in
fact
i
believe
my
father
and
he
would
have
overcome
that
they
have
many
thing
in
common

come

admire
and
finally
to

fisted
rough
hewn
upright
father
after

by
which
point
many

quite
frighten
side

up
he
have
brought
prich
with

to
have
to
buy
as
little
as
possible
later
and
as
much
as
i
could
then
this
trousseau
saw
me
through
for
quite
a
long
time
there
be
some
discussion
about
how
we
would
be
married
we
be
both
painfully
self
conscious
phil
to
the
point
where
he
want
us
to
be
married
in
new
york
s
city
hall
by
mayor
fiorello
la
guardia
whom
we
both
admire
and
i
be
to
wear
a
gray
flannel
suit
i
counter
with
two
nonnegotiable
demand
i
want
a
slightly
religious
ceremony
in
a
long
weddingish
dress
and
some
sort
of
small
informal
friendly
gathering
at
home
the
compromise
we
arrive
at
be
the
garden
at
the
farm
at
mount
kisco
which
i
consider
more
home
than
the
washington
house
neither
one
of
us
be
religious
in
the
formal
sense
but
i
want
something
more
religious

very
nice
low
key
lutheran

later
described
as
the
first
wartime
civil
liberty
case
it
be
a
case
on
which
the
young
men
differ
violently
from
felix
who
have
write
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
minersville
school
district
v
gobitis

that
the
state
could
require

i
m
sure
my
brother
all
take
part
felix
love
and
encourage
loud
and
violent
argument
which
everyone
usually
enjoy
but
this
time
the
argument
go
over
the
edge
into
bitter
passion
felix
deeply
believe
in
the
obligation
to
salute
the
flag
the
fight
grow
so
intense
that
at
one
point

large
tear
roll
down

s
redden
rotund
cheek
everyone
be
upset
the
argument
go
on
and
on
with
felix
at
another
point
say
as
bi
recall
everybody
always
talk
about
me
as
a
liberal
but
i
never
be

in
and
announce
that
the
minister

be
wait
for
an
hour
and

always
iron
hand
and

but
a
slap
and
a
tickle

his
sister

while
we
be
there

we
go
on
do
very
traditional
thing
bicycling
play
tennis
swim
and
reading
tennis
together
have
certain
tension
built
into
it
which
emerge
only
later
i
have
played
a
little
all
my
life
but
like
it
increasingly
especially
after
escape
bi
s
shadow
phil
have
played
less
but
since
it
be
something
i
enjoy
he
gamely
enter
into
it
and
in
time
grow
well
always
compensate
for
any
inadequacy
on
the
court
with
his
wit
which
begin
lovingly
but
often
end
up
with
a
sharp
and
upset
edge
we
have
one
hilarious
exchange
while
still
in
bermuda
that
remain
in
our
lore
we
be
play
double
and
phil
miss
an
easy
shot
i
say
oh
well
they
say
he
have
a
fine
mind
shortly
afterwards
i
miss
one
phil
retort
and
they
say
her
family
spent
million
on
her
game
after
the
honeymoon
and
a
short
stay
at
mount
kisco
we
go
down
to
washington
to
see
about
our
new
house
which
we
have
rent
for
the
come
year
and
then
set
out
for
florida
in
the
buick
convertible
i
have
inherit
from
my
brother
i
have
only
the
dimmest
notion
of
phil
s
family
never
have
met
any
of
them
nor
have
i
much
sense
from
have
live
in
washington
chicago
and
san
francisco
with
mount
kisco
summer
what
the
south
be
like
or
what
the
country
outside
city
be
like
as
we
enter
florida
i
saw
a
sign
in
front
of
an
apartment
house
that
read
no
dog
or
jew
allow
and
be
deeply
shaken
never
have
see
or
experienced
anything
so
ugly
we
drove
down
route
i
and
arrive
at
the
stone
house
that
phil
s
parent
have
built
when
bill
be
born
the
farm
itself
look
large
and
prosperous
but
flat
and
sandy
where
the
everglades
swamp
have
be
developed
and
drain
into
ditch
and
canal
we
stayed
at
the
house
with
phil
s
father
his
stepmother
hilda
whom
ernie
have
married
in
and
his
very
young
half
brother
bob
their
somewhat
spoil
only
child
it
be
not
an
easy
meeting
for
them
or
for
me
hilda
be
charm
warm
and
welcome
ernie
study
me
over
the
top
of
his
newspaper
he
be
shy
but
do
his
best
to
be
jovial
and
affectionate
one
day
when
i
be
lie
on
the
couch
in
the
living
room
write
thank
you
note
i
be
startle
to
be
spat
on
by
the
three
year
old
bob
phil
s
brother
bill
later
told
me
that
this
be
ala
bob
s
habit
at
that
point
in
his
life
i
thought
in
my
paranoid
way
that
there
must
be
a
message
there
bob
outgrew
all
this
of
course
and
developed
into
a
highly
successful
natural
and
excellent
politician
very
different
from
the
old
three
child
but
extremely
able
he
become
governor
of
florida
and
be
now
senator
a
strange
fulfillment
of
both
his
father
s
and
phil
s
ambition
he
have
all
the
graham
family
brain
and
charisma
and
a
great
deal
more
stability
than
phil
have
miami
be
difficult
for
me
for
many
reason
it
be
southern
and
no
one
have
ever
suggest
to
me
that
the
south
be
still
significantly
different
from
the
rest
of
the
country
certainly
more
sexist
in
atmosphere
woman
lunch
with
each
other
and
talk
household
problem
which
i
be
still
unaware
exist
i
be
tremendously
reassure
at
lunch
with
my
old
washington
friend
mary
cootes
belin
whose
husband
be
in
florida
work
for
pan
american
airline
when
she
told
me
that
she
too
knew
nothing
about
vacuum
cleaner
and
wash
machine
i
try
and
phil
s
family
and
friend
try
but
the
reality
be
that
i
knew
nothing
about
farm
or
about
florida
politics
which
be
the
bond
between
phil
and
his
father
still
i
work
hard
at
be
interested
as
we
drove
around
the
farm
look
at
the
cow
and
the
crop
phil
s
college
friend
seem
unlike
anyone
i
knew
and
i
didn
t
know
how
to
relate
to
them
one
of
our
more
traumatic
evening
be
spent
on
a
chamber
of
commerce
boat
ride
with
some
of
these
old
friend
this
be
a
double
cultural
shock
for
i
have
never
encounter
a
chamber
of
commerce
group
before
much
less
the
one
in
miami
then
still
a
comparatively
small
town
we
played
a
game
call
sniff
in
which
a
cigarette
wrapper
paper
be
pass
from
nose
to
nose
you
have
to
keep
it
up
by
inhale
until
you
pass
it
on
if
you
let
it
drop
you
have
to
kiss
the
man
with
whom
the
catastrophe
occur
it
be
a
modify
version
of
the
kid
game
of
post
office
this
strange
game
reduce
me
to
total
pulp
i
didn
t
know
whether
to
laugh
it
off
or
engage
in
it
today
of
course
i
see
that
i
be
ridiculously
uptight
and
shy
but
then
i
couldn
t
help
wonder
if
i
be
go
to
be
spending
the
rest
of
my
life
play
sniff
with
the
chamber
of
commerce
i
wept
on
the
way
home
out
of
worry
and
fear
that
i
couldn
t
cope
phil
stop
the
car
hug
me
and
told
me
not
to
worry
these
be
his
old
friend
but
he
too
have
grown
away
from
them
he
love
them
but
no
longer
saw
much
of
them
and
we
wouldn
t
be
do
this
kind
of
thing
forever
i
recover
and
we
survive
the
rest
of
the
three
week
visit
and
eventually
some
of
the
main
figure
from
his
miami
youth
become
my
good
friend
and
stayed
so
while
we
be
in
florida
i
also
met
mary
phil
s
sister
who
adore
him
mary
have
a
needlessly
hard
life
she
be
very
gift
and
bright
but
not
beautiful
she
have
want
to
go
north
to
a
dress
design
school
and
be
not

she
also
have
a
much
old
beau
whom
she
love
but
wasn
t
allow
to
marry
i
suppose
it
might
have
be
different
have
her
mother
live
mary
be
difficult
about
her
stepmother
hilda
who
be
not
much
old
than
she
and
whom
ernie
have
met
on
a
bus
trip
shortly
after
his
first
wife
s
death
mary
fought
the
idea
of
the
marriage
and
fought
with
hilda
phil
have
his
own
reservation
but
as
usual
be
the
peacemaker
in
the
situation
and
support
hilda
who
be
awfully
nice
ernie

her
and
i
get
along
well
with

and
how
she
have
never
dream
she
could
accept
someone
so
spontaneously
into
our
mystic
circle
she
also
write
when
i
think
how
useful
you
and
kay
will
be
in
the
make
of
the
new
world
that
lie
in
wait
for
us
i
almost
envy
you
both
such
an
opportunity
and
such
a
life
let
me
add
one
word
about
the
conversation
on
money
which
we
begin
on
the
terrace
of
the
cabin
but
never
complete
you
be
just
say
when
we
be
interrupt
that
money
be
a
danger
because
it
make
people
soft
that
be
true
especially
if
they
grow
up
with
it
but
for
people
like
you
and
me
who
have
our
own
way
to
make
during
our
most
formative
year
there
be
also
another
danger
i
have
driven
myself
mercilessly
all
my
life
first
out
of
fear
of
get
soft
and
later
from
habit
this
have
be
so
intense
an
obsession
that
i
fear
it
affected
eugene
and
the
child
almost
too
much
and
create
an
almost
restless
ambition
in
everybody
you
be
so
strong
and
sensible
that
you
need
not
fear
soften
need
not
even
fear
the
opposite
effect
which
it
have
on
me
but
i
thought
it
worth
mention
so
that
you
and
kay
will
feel
free
to
use
what
you
have
to
good
purpose
without
complex
of
one
sort
or
the
other
when
you
left
you
say
you
can
trust
me
with
your
daughter
mr
m
let
me
reply
as
my
birthday
message
that
i
never
trust
anybody
more
in
any
and
all
respect
we
start
back
north
on
august
and
arrive
in
washington
a
few
day
later
we
stayed
at
crescent
place
until
the
furniture
i
have
so
carefully
chosen
with
my
mother
arrive
at
our
new
house
at
th
street
and
then
in
the
late
summer
of
we
begin
our
married
life
together
in
our
first
home
chapter
nine
we
quickly
and
easily
settle
into
our
little
house
which
we
rent
unfurnished
for
a
month
the
house
just
outside
georgetown
behind
western
high
school
be
in
a
pleasant
convenient
unpretentious
neighborhood
of
row
house
call
burleith
it
have
a
tiny
living
room
into
which
you
walk
immediately
on
enter
a
din
room
and
a
small
kitchen
on
the
second
floor
be
a
nice
bedroom
over
the
living
room
and
two
little
room
that
become
study
for
each
of
us
there
be
a
daybed
for
guest
in
phil
s
study
at
the
back
of
the
house
be
a
screen
in
porch
and
a
postage
stamp
yard
take
up
mostly
by
a
small
tin
roofed
single
car
garage
the
house
be
furnish
sparsely
in
classic
modern
furniture
reflect
my
taste
at
the
time
since
the
furniture
be
a
gift
from
my
parent
it
be
all
make
to
order
luckily
phil
be
blissfully
unaware
of
how
much
thing
like
that
cost
so
he
didn
t
protest
we
bought
living
room
curtain
from
woodward
and
lothrop
this
little
house
help
us
to
accomplish
what
phil
and
i
both
want
to
live
as
our
contemporary
do
because
of
phil
s
insistence
and
my
agreement
that
we
live
on
our
combine
salary
and
because
mine
be
so
little
to
begin
with
my
first
inclination
be
to
stop
work
and
be
a
stay
at
home
wife
learn
to
cook
and
keep
house
phil
be
horrify
by
the
idea
he
say
it
would
be
terrible
to
be
work
late
and
have
me
anxiously
wait
at
the
door
with
a
lemon
pie
furthermore
he
really
want
me
to
go
on
work
and
decide
we
could
pay
a
maid
with
what
i
earn
so
the
superb
mattie
jeffress
enter
our
life
a
friend
of
my
mother
s
laundress
mattie
come
each
day
before
breakfast
and
stayed
through
dinner
with
two
half
day
off
if
i
remember
correctly
she
do
the
cleaning
and
personal
laundry
as
well
as
the
cooking
for
this
i
blush
to
admit
we
paid
her
all
of
a
week
phil
be
earn
a
year
as
a
law
clerk
which
he
point
out
be
far
from
a
sacrifice
since
at
that
time
this
be
equal
to
or
somewhat
more
than
the
begin
salary
in
law
firm
i
be
earn
about
a
year
we
have
one
small
cushion
a
wedding
present
from
an
aunt
which
i
thought
i
could
use
for
extra
like
theater
and
travel
ticket
in
a
sense
phil
be
almost
as
spoil
and
unaware
of
finance
as
i
be
have
go
straight
from
law
school
into
the
luxurious
arm
of
life
at
hockley
i
begin
to
learn
how
to
live
on
a
different
scale
the
enormous
trousseau
i
d
bought
spar
me
from
worry
about
clothes
but
it
be
clear
that
i
hadn
t
the
remotest
idea
about
the
particular
of
domestic
life
and
give
the
hardworking
mattie
there
be
still
a
great
deal
i
didn
t
have
to
learn
a
hamburger
or
scramble
egg
on
her
night
off
be
almost
beyond
my
competence
for
instance
there
be
still
odd
lacuna
i
confess
i
have
never
in
my
life
press
a
dress
i
be
driven
to
a
frenzy
of
small
economy
do
ridiculous
thing
to
save
money
like
take
the
laundry
to
tolman
s
the
local
cleaner
rather
than
have
it
picked
up
because
it
save
ten
cent
a
pound
of
course
tolman
s
also
ruin
the
linen
monogrammed
sheet
my
mother
have
give
me
for
my
trousseau
but
i
have
no
idea
that
these
be
very
special
since
that
s
what
i
have
slept
on
all
my
life
when
we
move
into
our
house
in
september
i
begin
keep
a
little
account
book
dutifully
note
every
penny
spent
include
the
cost
of
gas
and
oil
for
the
car
stamp
grocery
even
our
personal
allowance
which
be
each
per
week
the
entry
taper
off
in
october
and
there
be
no
more
after
november
so
obviously
i
quickly
tire
of
this
kind
of
accounting
but
except
for
the
wedding
present
i
never
use
a
cent
of
my
own
until
two
year
later
when
phil
go
into
the
army
even
when
i
get
pregnant
i
wore
borrow
clothes
to
supplement
my
inexpensive
department
store
maternity
dress
and
look
very
dowdy
i
m
sure
out
of
a
driven
desire
to
live
up
to
our
agreement
yet
despite
my
overdo
it
it
be
good
for
me
and
for
us
both
to
live
on
our
salary
in
fact
most
of
what
phil
decreed
and
i
assent
to
be
good
for
us
and
we
be
have
a
great
time
our
friend
continued
much
the
same
that
year
with
the
hockley
boy
especially
prich
bill
sheldon
and
john
ferguson
be
among
our
closest
at
the
same
time
several
new
people
enter
our
life
prich
start
take
out
a
beautiful
half
english
girl
name
evangeline
bell
who
be
attorney
general
francis
biddle
s
secretary
assistant
i
grow
even
closer
to
evangeline
later
after
she
married
david
bruce
joe
rauh
one
of
the
great
fight
liberal
and
his
wife

our
great
friend
during
this
time
we
also
get
to
know
joseph
alsop
well
he
be
not
that
much
old
than
we
be
but
seem
at
least
a
generation
ahead
in
his
social
life
and
experience
also
important
to
us
that
year
be
the
romillys

the
international
brigade
in
spain
to
take
her
with
him
he
agree
and
off
they
go
together
fell
in
love
en
route
and
create
a
terrible
public
storm
during
which
anthony

then
foreign
minister
sent
a
destroyer
to
retrieve
decca

be
surprised
to
find
the
atmosphere
there
so
congenial
and
my
parent
so
warm
and
welcome
remark
that

open
warmth
didn

where
they
get
a
job
in
a
bar
whose
owner

felix
would
say
where
be
phil
on
his
way
judge
i
would
respond
use
the
title
we
always
give
him
while
simultaneously
kick
phil
out
of
bed
and
help
him
rush
out
phil
have
bought
a
secondhand
oldsmobile
paint
a
weird
shade
of
green
by
some
previous
owner
in
which
he
would
pick
up
the
justice
at
his
house
in
georgetown
and
drive
him
to
work
and
home
again
they
would
talk
argue
and
gossip
nonstop
felix
often
dictate
to
phil
who
typed
while
the
justice
strode
up
and
down
compose
when
felix
s
prose
occasionally
turn
elaborate
purple
or
bromidic
phil
disapprove
simply
stop
type
if
they
disagreed
about
an
opinion
argument
would
go
on
and
on
until
felix
be
either
influence
or
simply
decide
felix
be
so
tolerant
that
at
time
his
original
opinion
would
simply
not
get
write
but
when
strong
emotion
be
involve
the
argument
could
go
on
for
month
during
one
case
about
which
phil
and
felix
disagreed
strongly
phil
look
disgruntle
come
in
after
drop
the
justice
at
his
house
on
th
street
apparently
they
have
argue
all
the
way
home
as
soon
as
he
walk
into
the
house
the
phone
rang
and
the
argument
continued
unabated
until
to
my
surprise
i
heard
phil
say
well
i
don
t
care
what
you
do
judge
i
just
don
t
want
to
see
you
make
yourself
look
silly
with
which
he
bang
down
the
phone
i
don
t
remember
what
the
case
be
but
i
do
remember
that
they
kept
delay
write
the
decision
while
the
argument
rag
on
finally
they
work
all
night
to
finish
write
the
opinion
at
the
very
last
possible
moment
before
the
court
adjourn
and
then
return
home
in
the
early
morning
in
a
cab
felix
so
tire
he
didn
t
focus
on
the
driver
s
ask
for
his
address
phil
quote
the
taxi
driver
as
look
back
at
this
exhaust
man
and
say
what
s
the
matter
you
stupid
or
something
another
day
the
justice
come
into
our
house
with
phil
grabbed
my
arm
very
tightly
as
he
often
do
sometimes
so
tightly
that
it
hurt
and
ask
kay
do
phil
tell
you
what
hughes
say
on
the
court
the
other
day
no
he
didn
t
judge
i
reply
phil
why
didn
t
you
tell
kay
you
should
have
told
her
holmes
told
his
wife
everything
felix
have
boundless
energy
and
ebullience
and
a
tremendous
joie
de
vivre
he
be
cerebral
of
course
but
he
be
also
emotional
he
love
engage
in
verbal
duel
over
issue
and
he
love
certain
kind
of
people
particularly
those
whose
idea
of
right
and
justice
jibed
with
his
own
but
he
also
like
people
who
disagreed
with
him
and
stood
up
to
him
if
they
be
very
smart
and
be
within
his
mental
spectrum
it
wasn
t
enough
to
be
intelligent
if
you
bore
him
or
be
pedestrian
or
have
a
literal
mind
because
the
frankfurter
be
childless
felix
seem
to
adopt
as
his
intellectual
son
the
young
harvard
law
student
who
interested
and
amuse
him
hence
the
fullness
of
the
relationship
with
the
law
clerk
and
their
family
he
love
laughter
and
gossip
and
he
encourage
the
extreme
irreverence
of
his
favorite
student
and
like
to
be
challenged
by
them
to
an
outsider
brought
up
with
old
fashion
manner
the
boy
seem
breathtakingly
rude
but
felix
didn
t
see
it
that
way
the
shout
argument
and
insult
be
simply
his
prefer
form
of
communicate
prich
be
particularly
irreverent
someone
report
that
at
a
law
clerk
dinner
prich
sat
slump
over
a
conference
table
drum
his
finger
with
his
eye
half
shut
while
the
argument
rag
suddenly
felix
look
down
the
table
and
say
prich
what
be
you
do
prich
look
up
and
say
counting
the
digression
in
your
argument

that
he

he
didn

intensified
phil

after
hour

more
because

lovett
felt
there
be
a
bottleneck
in

that

could
take
enough
of

off
hopkins
to
enable
him
to

finally

such
dispersion
of

in
the

until
the

be
create
that
this
informal

quite
young

with
absolutely
no
formal
authority
be
actually
able
to
step
into
the

and
compensate
partially
for
that
lack
of
a
center
this
chaos

resolve
when
jimmy

he
have
a

developed
for
make
know
its
concern
be
that
of

partly
to
al
friendly
who

from
the
washington
daily
news
early
in

who
be
write
his
very
popular
and
widely
distribute
national
column
with
bob
allen
prich
be
thought
by
the

to
be
leak
too
much
and
too
often
to
drew
pearson
who
be
a
personal
friend
so
one
even
he
be
told
that
he
should
stop
that
his
leak
be
do
more
harm
than
good
two
week
later
the
group
decide
that
something
ought
to
be
leak
to
pearson
and
ask
prich
to
leak
it
be
you
sure
ask
prich
yes
say
the
group
well
all
right
then
prich
say
i
ve
already
do
it
phil
seem
to
wear
one
hat
in
the
lend

administration
and
another
in
the

management
although
nominally
he
be
base
in
these
agency
practically
he
be
all
over
the
place
wherever
he
work
he
acquire
a
reputation
as
an
expediter
he
be
go
from
his
office
so
much
that
his
friend
say
his
secretary
spent
her
time
knit
sweater
for
several
month
in
the
spring
of

be
detach
from
the

justice
there
and
who
ask
him
to
work
for
australia
as
liaison
to

so
he
work
full
time
with
the
australian

after
the
japanese
invade
the

of

later
when
phil

to
the

highly
laudatory
letter
about

of

early
enough
to
make
the
strategic

possible
it

a
major
role
in
generate
and
execute
the
measure
necessary
to
put
the

so
that
much
of

the

me
bereft
so
i
be
deliriously
happy
to
be
pregnant
once
more
phil
who
have
be
reject
initially
by
the
army
because
of
eyesight
problem
and
because
he
be
married
have
decide
to
wait
for
our
baby
to
be
born
before
do
anything
more
about
the
military
despite
his
determination
to
join
in
one
exchange
between
us
i
have
deplore
the
fact
that
we
have
the
bad
luck
to
live
in
a
world
with
hitler
to
which
phil
respond
i
don
t
know
maybe
it
s
a
privilege
to
have
to
fight
the
big
son
of
a
bitch
in
history
by
may
i
be
experience
a
lethargy
even
great
than
usual
pregnancy
seem
to
dull
my
mind
and
sap
my
energy
perhaps
just
from
the
sheer
exhaustion
of
carry
that
much
extra
weight
around
my
listless
ness
be
intersperse
with
burst
of
activity
on
the
cooking
entertain
and
shopping
front
i
wasn
t
work
any
longer
and
as
i
write
to
my
friend
sidney
hyman
i
resign
myself
quite
contentedly
to
the
life
of
a
vegetable
i
go
to
cooking
school
in
the
morning
have
lunch
with
friend
sat
in
the
sun
with
other
pregnant
lady
talk
gossiped
do
everything
in
short
that
s
in
the
book
include
lay
out
my
husband
s
slipper
and
smoking
jacket
i
m
serious
i
assure
you
and
the
funniest
part
of
all
be
that
i
like
it
i
have
bought
the
thing
we
need
for
the
baby
include
three
rubber
sheet
with
the
crib
although
phil
protest
that
no
child
of
his
would
need
them
and
i
have
gain
a
lot
of
weight
and
be
quite
uncomfortable
particularly
when
it
start
to
get
hot
in
washington
we
be
begin
to
think
the
baby
be
overdue
so
i
suggest
to
my
doctor
that
he
induce
labor
which
he
do
but
it
be
too
soon
and
the
baby
wasn
t
ready
when
after
three
day
it
finally
begin
to
be
born
the
cord
be
around
its
neck
a
situation
that
ordinarily
could
be
dealt
with
apparently
that
night
with
wartime
help
shortage
the
doctor
be
deliver
several
baby
at
once
and
by
the
time
he
get
to
my
problem
it
be
too
late
we
lose
the
baby
boy
when
i
come
to
after
the
long
ordeal
i
look
at
phil
and
groggily
ask
be
the
baby
all
right
when
he
say
no
i
couldn
t
believe
it
i
have
never
heard
of
anyone
lose
a
baby
and
be
so
disbelieve
that
i
be
sure
it
couldn
t
possibly
be
true
but
it
be
all
too
real
i
be
devastate
i
will
never
forget
get
back
to
the
house
where
phil
have
remove
all
of
the
baby
s
thing
so
that
it
wouldn
t
be
even
more
painful
i
begin
to
realize
not
only
that
there
be
no
baby
but
that
phil
would
now
be
leave
to
go
into
the
army
and
i
would
be
alone
it
be
a
terrible
anguish
compound
by
a
desperate
feel
that
we
d
never
have
child
and
an
even
great
fear
that
something
might
happen
to
him
all
the
bad
dread
combine
phil
be
wonderful
to
me
and
we
both
be
help
by
my
father
my
mother
be
so
upset
i
don
t
remember
see
her
until
several
week
afterwards
so
phil
do
enlist
in
the
army
and
before
he
be
to
leave
we
have
a
reunion
at
mount
kisco
that
include
my
brother
bill
who
be
go
into
the
medical
corp
and
his
wife
mary
one
night
while
we
be
all
at
dinner
my
mother
still
very
republican
start
pick
on
the
young
new
dealer
who
of
course
be
not
only
our
friend
but
by
then
be
all
either
go
to
the
military
or
work
in
defense
i
be
still
emotionally
vulnerable
and
her
barb
and
gibe
about
these
young
men
as
draft
dodger
be
like
a
match
thrown
onto
a
gasoline
soak
bonfire
she
and
i
have
an
enormous
and
horrible
set
to
i
knew
that
she
be
still
spending
her
time
on
her
book
about
dostoyevsky
tolstoy
and
mann
in
addition
despite
the
war
mount
kisco
be
continue
to
operate
on
its
normal
luxurious
scale
for
example
i
knew
she
have
laid
in
a
great
deal
of
sugar
which
be
in
short
supply
or
already
ration
so
i
demand
to
know
what
she
herself
be
do
to
help
the
war
effort
write
this
remote
treatise
in
a
house
full
of
servant
and
hoard
sugar
she
retort
by
ask
what
i
be
do
about
it
since
i
have
just
lose
my
baby
and
be
about
to
lose
my
husband
to
the
army
i
explode
into
tear
we
be
separate
by
phil
and
bill
who
take
me
upstairs
they
then
talk
to
her
in
forthright
term
acknowledge
that
i
shouldn
t
have
attack
her
so
emotionally
but
state
that
in
fact
she
really
should
do
something
more
constructive
than
what
she
be
do
they
suggest
she
turn
her
attention
to
reporting
on
america
s
war
impact
area
and
to
her
great
credit
she
take
their
suggestion
seriously
and
begin
an
earnest
and
constructive
career
as
a
travel
correspondent
on
the
war
and
the
home
front
those
first
few
year
of
marriage
before
the
war
interrupt
all
our
life
phil
and
i
have
a
very
happy
time
i
grow
up
considerably
mostly
thanks
to
him
what
he
do
for
me
be
more
than
helpful
it
be
essential
he
begin
to
liberate
me
from
my
family
and
from
the
myth
they
have
propagate
eventually
lead
me
down
very
different
path
from
those
i
have
know
earlier
he
counterbalance
my
ingrown
resistance
to
new
and
different
idea
to
people
with
whom
i
didn
t
agree
politically
to
not
have
to
hew
to
anyone
s
standard
but
my
own
phil
also
brought
into
my
life
more
laughter
gaiety
irreverence
for
rule
and
originality
at
the
same
time
that
he
freed
me
in
many
way
from
my
family
phil
also
grow
quickly
to
appreciate
both
of
my
parent
and
get
along
with
them
well
than
most
of
their
own
child
do
despite
his
early
apprehension
about
my
father
s
wealth
politics
and
possible
impulse
to
control
phil
gradually
grow
very
close
to
him
end
up
by
become
one
of
the
two
or
three
closest
friend
of
his
lifetime
he
love
stay
up
with
my
father
listen
to
him
reminisce
about
his
life
his
experience
and
his
success
perhaps
we
child
have
all
get
too
jade
by
my
father
s
grow
habit
of
speak
in
a
monologue
rather
than
invite
an
exchange
of
any
kind
we
found
ourselves
almost
involuntarily
click
off
our
mind
but
phil
would
respond
question
remember
and
enjoy
their
blossoming
relationship
give
both
of
them
great
pleasure
phil
and
my
mother
also
get
along
well
she
adore
him
from
the
begin
and
be
closer
to
him
in
many
way
than
to
me
emphasize
to
the
rest
of
us
in
the
family
that
she
and
phil
and
only
they
knew
what
it
be
like
to
grow
up
poor
he
admire
her
but
remain
far
more
ambivalent
about
her
than
about
my
father
indeed
he
be
very
realistic
about
her
and
at
time
quite
tough
and
critical
but
though
phil
be
a
great
help
to
both
my
parent
he
always
insist
that
we
lead
our
own
life
he
would
always
go
to
their
aid
if
they
be
lonely
or
sick
or
in
trouble
but
he
refuse
to
be
use
particularly
by
my
mother
or
to
be
dominate
by
her
when
she
insist
on
our
come
to
dinner
because
she
felt
phil
should
meet
so
and
so
he
would
respond
that
he
would
be
glad
to
keep
them
company
when
they
really
want
us
but
we
wouldn
t
be
just
another
two
seat
at
her
dinner
table
unaccustomed
as
i
be
to
think
of
decline
her
invitation
it
gradually
dawn
on
me
that
he
be
right
although
he
be
much
the
strong
phil
also
learn
from
me
to
some
extent
what
i
brought
to
him
be
a
great
knowledge
of
the
world
s
way
an
appreciation
of
art
and
music
and
beauty
and
of
course
the
world
of
my
parent
the
post
and
washington
all
of
which
he
love
i
also
brought
him
some
stability
but
always
it
be
he
who
decide
and
i
who
respond
from
the
early
day
of
our
relationship
for
instance
i
thought
that
we
have
friend
because
of
him
and
be
invite
because
of
him
it
wasn
t
until
year
later
that
i
look
at
the
downside
of
all
this
and
realize
that
perversely
i
have
seem
to
enjoy
the
role
of
doormat
wife
for
whatever
reason
i
like
to
be
dominate
and
to
be
the
implementer
but
although
i
be
thoroughly
fascinate
and
charm
by
phil
i
be
also
slightly
resentful
when
i
thought
about
it
at
feel
such
complete
dependence
on
another
person
as
the
war
come
to
rule
our
life
i
be
amaze
that
we
could
continue
to
be
so
happy
despite
the
condition
of
the
world
what
i
remember
most
from
those
first
year
of
marriage
be
our
fun
with
each
other
the
constant
growth
and
learn
and
always
a
lot
of
laughter
chapter
ten
early
on
the
morning
of
july
phil
left
for
the
army
air
corp
as
a
private
go
first
to
fort
george
meade
the
neighbor
army
installation
in
maryland
the
dreadful
moment
of
our
part
come
at
the
greyhound
bus
terminal
in
downtown
washington
already
a
depress
place
but
make
more
so
by
the
sight
of
nervous
recruit
huddle
together
although
i
knew
i
be
go
to
join
him
wherever
he
be
ship
the
unknown
of
the
part
get
the
best
of
me
and
i
embrace
him
turn
and
fairly
dove
through
the
door
of
the
terminal
as
he
join
the
group
of
jittery
inductee
i
happen
to
look
down
just
as
i
flee
discover
that
my
slip
be
show
and
decide
that
once
more
i
have
fail
in
a
crisis
phil
write
me
from
fort
meade
the
very
next
day
describe
in
great
detail
his
first
impression
of
army
life
the
barnlike
reception
center
the
primitive
cafeteria
with
surprisingly
good
food
the
physical
inspection
and
the
un
air
condition
barrack
in
which
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
cot
use
his
toilet
kit
as
a
lap
desk
on
which
to
write
the
thirteen
men
from
d
c
have
stuck
together
with
phil
sit
next
to
the
only
black
man
among
the
recruit
on
the
bus
ride
from
washington
phil
have
quickly
notice
that
the
man
be
be
ignore
and
readily
establish
that
jim
crow
be
very
active
in
the
army
with
the
one
negro
be
pointedly
cast
out
of
the
group
after
a
short
time
at
fort
meade
phil
be
sent
for
basic
training
to
atlantic
city
where
i
join
him
and
begin
my
life
as
a
camp
follower
i
found
a
room
in
a
boarding
house
not
far
from
the
boardwalk
where
we
share
a
nightly
two
and
a
half
hour
much
of
the
rest
of
the
time
i
spent
watch
the
men
march
up
and
down
the
boardwalk
in
the
humid
heat
in
some
way
go
to
atlantic
city
meant
get
start
on
normal
life
again
but
it
be
depress
for
me
in
almost
every
way
from
the
room
house
to
the
damp
heat
to
the
all
too
brief
visit
with
phil
after
a
few
week
he
be
hospitalize
with
the
flu
or
pneumonia
and
since
i
be
not
allow
to
visit
him
i
go
back
to
washington
to
wait
to
hear
about
his
next
assignment
phil
write
touchingly
from
the
hospital
my
afternoon
sleep
be
rather
doze
off
and
on
and
all
through
it
as
all
through
the
morning
i
thought
of
us
i
be
go
to
say
you
but
that
isn
t
accurate
for
i
never
think
of
anything
but
the
two
of
us
together
it
be
strange
and
wonderful
and
strengthen
about
us
more
and
more
every
day
for
two
year
we
have
become
the
single
most
important
fact
for
me
today
reading
back
magazine
i
thought
how
horribly
fakish
washington
be
run
and
then
i
thought
how
much
of
this
army
be
boarding
school
sadism
pass
on
blindly
by
rote
and
then
i
realize
that
though
those
be
thing
of
importance
to
me
they
be
dwarfed
by
something
i
feel
sure
only
you
and
i
have
i
don
t
know
how
it
happen
to
come
to
us
katringham
but
i
know
we
must
treasure
it
and
i
know
we
do
treasure
it
sit
around
now
i
get
funny
little
thought
all
the
time
about
how
i
ll
get
to
a
phone
the
minute
i
land
at
my
new
post
and
tell
you
to
start
on
at
once
about
just
when
i
may
be
able
to
squeeze
a
three
or
four
day
pas
so
we
can
go
off
together
about
how
after
the
war
all
other
consideration
about
employment
must
be
secondary
to
my
need
of
several
hour
a
day
to
be
together
with
you
i
love
think
all
those
thing
they
don
t
come
to
mind
out
of
sadness
from
be
a
little
bit
apart
now
i
think
them
because
they
be
part
of
the
knowledge
of
our
inseparability
a
beautiful
piece
of
knowledge
kate
phil
be
always
ambivalent
about
the
army
on
the
whole
it
be
much
as
he
expect
and
he
like
it
more
than
not
what
he
didn
t
like
be
its
illogic
he
would
get
frustrate
by
the
straitjacket
of
the
bureaucracy
the
stupid
constant
yowlings
of
the
noncommissioned
officer
the
mix
of
efficiency
with
inefficiency
ineptitude
incompetence
waste
and
negligence
fuck
be
the
universal
adjective
it
seem
to
apply
to
everything
and
everyone
the
fuck
chiseler
the
fuck
sergeant
the
fuck
camp
on
the
other
hand
phil
love
the
all
american
men
among
the
best
of
whom
be
a
young
pole
from
the
steel
mill
of
pittsburgh
who
say
it
be
important
to
trust
the
men
no
matter
what
they
might
seem
like
these
be
good
fellow
here
i
be
afraid
they
d
be
tough
but
they
re
not
you
can
trust
em
christ
you
gotta
trust
em
on
the
battlefield
why
not
here
phil
like
the
men
from
whom
he
could
get
honest
and
useful
information
how
to
make
a
bed
properly
how
to
avoid
the
morning
rush
by
shave
at
night
know
these
men
give
us
both
a
great
pride
in
america
many
of
them
although
married
and
already
parent
have
enlist
because
they
believe
in
defend
their
country
most
of
them
have
a
peculiar
mixture
of
gentleness
and
toughness
i
be
move
particularly
by
the
patriotism
and
sacrifice
of
the
boy
from
the
south
who
always
seem
most
heroic
to
me
at
the
end
of
six
week
phil
be
ship
out
of
atlantic
city
we
knew
only
that
his
destination
be
one
of
three
communication
school
run
by
the
air
force
by
chance
the
school
be
one
two
and
three
day
away
from
washington
when
phil
call
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
to
say
come
right
away
he
be
in
the
farthest
and
most
remote
radio
school
the
one
in
sioux
fall
south
dakota
at
first
i
be
worried
about
what
life
in
sioux
fall
would
be
like
but
then
my
father
say
he
have
save
the
town
in
when
he
head
the
farm
loan
board
and
thought
that
he
still
have
enough
contact
to
help
me
if
all
else
fail
in
fact
i
be
really
pleased
about
the
post
because
i
felt
i
would
rather
be
in
a
small
and
unexpected
place
than
somewhere
like
atlantic
city
or
even
st
louis
i
arrive
in
sioux
fall
in
early
september
and
settle
in
within
a
few
week
what
we
found
there
be
a
warm
and
friendly
town
with
lot
of
pretty
little
white
house
with
service
flag
in
the
window
the
cling
odor
of
john
morrell
s
meat
pack
house
share
the
atmosphere
with
the
coal
smoke
from
hundred
of
barrack
stove
we
never
saw
the
supposedly
picturesque
fall
that
give
the
town
its
name
and
in
fact
could
hardly
imagine
anything
fall
anywhere
in
such
a
great
expanse
of
flatness
a
reclaim
swamp
just
a
mile
northwest
of
town
flat
as
florida
provide
a
superhighway
for
prairie
gale
the
camp
be
locate
right
there
with
the
school
building
spread
down
its
middle
like
an
assembly
line
the
men
go
in
one
end
the
first
day
to
learn
the
fundamental
of
electricity
and
emerge
from
the
other
end
as
radio
operator
and
mechanic
several
month
later
the
military
camp
itself
have
a
population
of
forty
five
thousand
the
town
originally
have
fifteen
thousand
resident
crowd
be
severe
and
living
quarter
for
the
family
of
the
serviceman
be
difficult
to
unearth
there
be
no
possibility
of
my
get
a
decent
apartment
and
though
a
room
in
a
house
be
just
possible
i
opt
for
a
hotel
where
i
could
have
my
own
bath
and
telephone
and
privacy
one
thing
we
both
quickly
learn
be
not
to
believe
anyone
or
anything
about
the
army
rumor
flew
around
constantly
for
example
that
the
men
would
all
go
on
to
gunnery
school
from
sioux
fall
and
that
the
average
life
of
gunner
on
bomber
at
the
front
be
four
minute
another
rumor
be
that
the
whole
air
corp
would
be
require
to
have
new
and
different
uniform
which
would
cost
every
man
apiece
the
truth
amid
the
rampant
rumor
be
much
harder
for
us
than
i
be
admit
even
to
myself
we
really
felt
for
the
first
time
in
our
spoil
life
what
it
be
like
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
heap
and
miserable
it
seem
as
if
an
unseen
hand
be
involve
in
a
constant
plot
to
make
our
life
unhappy
the
world
we
live
in

run
by
half
mad
civilian

appear
to

to
their
whiff
of

in
a
peculiar
kind
of
mindless
brutality
toward
private

for
no
reason
and
the

commit
by
one
or
two
individual
weird

of
a
stay
at

training
but
our
momentary
euphoria

brought
to
an
abrupt
end
an

lung
brought
to

seven
or
eight
calcify
spot
that

him
from

permit
him
to
remain

in

for
the
hop
for

we
settle
down
for
at

another
six

the
consolation
of

it
through
to

to
live
at

terribly
organize
for

for

situate
as
it
be
near
a
town
of
nine
hundred
people
and
offering
few
if
any
escape
for
the
men
it
be
a
cold
and
barren
place
and
phil
be
already
a
bit
depressed
by
the
time
he
reach
it
his
time
there
be
probably
the
nadir
of
his
military
life
marked
by
constant
bad
weather
height
of
inefficiency
and
depth
of
loneliness
my
letter
to
phil
and
his
to
me
be
like
long
continue
conversation
mine
about
whom
i
d
see
where
i
d
be
some
national
issue
and
the
frequently
discuss
baby
always
refer
to
as
petunia
his
about
the
difficulty
of
life
in
ephrata
i
felt
unapologetic
about
confide
any
low
feeling
i
have
because
i
knew
how
i
d
feel
if
phil
didn
t
tell
me
how
he
felt
i
didn
t
see
why
there
should
be
add
to
the
strain
of
a
relationship
by
correspondence
the
false
burden
of
pseudo
gallantry
in
truth
i
be
worried
about
the
real
reason
for
phil
s
gloom
whether
he
be
unhappy
about
the
long
run
or
the
short
be
his
mood
like
mine
affected
by
the
weather
and
not
be
together
or
be
it
the
lack
of
congenial
company
or
what
be
it
in
september
my
mother
have
make
a
tour
of
britain
s

visit
hospital
child
s
nursery

her
conclusion
be
that
the
united

have
yet
to
learn
what
she
consider
her
major
impression
of
that
trip
that
this
be
a
people
s
war
and
that
the
maximum
war
effort
in
great
britain
have
set
a
social
revolution
in
motion
her
observation
of
life
on
the
home
front
in
england
propel
her
to
set
out
early
in
on
a
four
month
trip
around
the
united
state
visit
factory
shipyard
tenement
school
day
care
center
reporting
on
america
s
home
front
and
the
social
effect
of
the
war
in
mother
s
absence
i
enjoy
the
relative
calm
i
kept
my
father
company
and
help
him
at
the
smoker
or
off
the
record
stag
dinner
and
seminar
he
often
give
to
bring
together
administration
official
and
foreign
dignitary
with
the
post
s
editor
and
writer
so
that
they
could
exchange
view
on
how
the
war
be
go
and
what
need
to
be
do
by
business
to
help
the
effort
but
the
dinner
i
remember
most
be
the
quiet
one
when
just
he
and
i
be
together
we
rarely
talk
intimately
neither
of
us
have
a
great
capacity
at
that
time
for
intimacy
but
without
acknowledge
it
we
have
grown
very
close
and
very
dependent
on
each
other
during
this
time
he
be
as
pleased
as
a
little
boy
because
the

of

reputation

grown
immeasurably

have
gain
substantial
prestige
and
be

the
positive
effect
of
all
the
effort
and
money

in
the
ten

my
father
bought
it

he
be
wary
of

too
optimistic
nothing
could
conceal
his
intense
excitement

great
deal
of
time

about
the

i
knew
how
much
he

unfortunately
like
all
publication
the
post
sank
back
into
its
old
way
after
the
men
return
a
nucleus
remain
however
although
largely
on

despite
all
the
evident
improvement
in

however
it
be
in
no
way
certain
that
the
post
would
survive
the
washington
newspaper
scene
be
very
chaotic
particularly
for
a
town
its
size
no
other
city
of
half
a
million
have
so
many
paper
none
of
which
be
a
fly
by
night
the
struggle
for
survival
be
omnipresent
and
at
time
a
discourage
burden
to
my
father
who
be
near
seventy
see
him
as
i
do
each
day
i
be
constantly
worried
about
how
tire
he
seem
and
how
hard
he
be
work
these
past
ten
year
have
take
a
tremendous
toll
give
his
concern
my
father
turn
his
attention
more
and
more
to
think
about
the
future
of
the
post
the
first
inkling
i
have
that
he
might
have
begin
to
look
at
phil
as
a
white
knight
come
just
two
year
after
our
marriage
in
the
fall
of
dad
and
i
be
on
a
train
come
back
from
mount
kisco
and
naturally
we
be
talk
about
phil
i
remember
his
comment
on
how
well
phil
write
and
how
much
he
d
love
to
have
him
on
the
paper
i
told
phil
in
a
letter
you
well
watch
out
if
you
don
t
want
it
be
all
i
can
say
you
may
find
it
in
your
stock
christmas
morning
shortly
after
this
my
father
seem
to
have
brought
up
with
both
of
us
the
possibility
of
phil
s
work
at
the
paper
after
the
war
certainly
he
saw
his
whole
endeavor
as
useless
unless
he
could
project
a
future
for
the
post
in
the
family
in
those
day
of
course
the
only
possible
heir
would
have
be
a
male
and
since
my
brother
be
in
medicine
and
have
show
little
or
no
interest
in
the
business
my
father
naturally
thought
of
phil
far
from
trouble
me
personally
that
my
father
thought
of
my
husband
and
not
me
it
pleased
me
in
fact
it
never
cross
my
mind
that
he
might
have
view
me
as
someone
to
take
on
an
important
job
at
the
paper
although
the
impend
war
have
prevent
us
from
move
to
florida
after
phil
have
finish
his
year
as
law
clerk
with
frankfurter
he
still
have
plan
to
follow
brandeis
s
admonition
to
young
harvard
law
school
graduate
to
go
back
where
they
come
from
and
become
part
of
grassroots
america
give
his
love
of
politics
and
natural
affinity
for
it
this
be
phil
s
plan
and
his
desire
he
want
to
do
public
service
and
to
deal
with
societal
problem
as
do
many
of
the
best
and
the
brightest
of
our
generation
or
at
least
most
of
those
we
knew
and
despite
their
mutually
respectful
affectionate
relationship
phil
have
always
say
he
would
never
work
for
my
father
but
now
he
be
face
with
the
actual
possibility
of
work
on
the
post
it
be
an
excite
idea
though
with
a
lot
of
risk
involve
it
would
be
a
tough
struggle
in
an
area
in
which
he
have
only
a
passing
indirect
knowledge
through
talk
to
my
father
phil
have
to
weigh
the
offer
against
not
only
his
ambition
to
go
into
law
and
politics
in
florida
but
his
own
father
s
wish
that
he
come
to
florida
to
be
part
of
the
dairy
business
there
phil
be
in
officer
candidate
school
in
new
haven
when
most
of
the
talk
between
him
and
my
father
take
place
and
between
the
two
of
us
phil
and
i
sat
on
the
bed
in
my
room
at
the
taft
hotel
for
many
hour
discuss
my
father
s
offer
i
love
the
idea
but
didn
t
try
to
persuade
phil
when
he
ask
me
what
i
thought
i
ducked
say
i
love
washington
it
be
my
home
but
i
knew
i
could
be
happy
other
place
as
well
i
also
knew
i
love
the
post
but
he
be
the
one
who
would
be
work
and
it
really
have
to
be
his
decision
this
be
his
life
and
he
have
to
decide
what
he
want
to
do
with
it
after
much
talk
consultation
and
soul
search
he
finally
decide
to
accept
agree
with
my
father
s
philosophy
he
saw
that
he
could
be
involve
in
public
issue
through
the
paper
as
well
as
through
politics
he
conclude
that
the
post
be
a
great
opportunity
albeit
a
risky
one
before
he
left
for
overseas
my
brother
have
suggest
that
i
check
in
with
a
new
obstetrician
at
john
hopkins
hospital
in
baltimore
whom
he
and
my
sister
in
law
want
me
to
go
to
for
the
baby
i
be
so
traumatize
by
what
have
happen
before
that
i
want
to
return
to
my
old
doctor
probably
as
a
way
of
reassure
myself
that
the
loss
of
the
first
baby
be
an
inevitable
accident
i
go
on
deny
that
anything
wrong
have
be
do
attribute
the
tragedy
to
fate
bill
point
out
that
a
teach
hospital
like
john
hopkins
would
keep
good
staff
longer
his
advice
lead
me
to
go
there
for
the
birth
of
all
four
of
my
child
as
phil
whiled
away
his
time
in
ephrata
this
baby
s
due
date
near
and
all
appear
to
be
well
i
have
be
warn
by
my
doctor
that
in
order
to
circumvent
the
problem
of
get
to
baltimore
in
gas
restrict
wartime
i
should
move
there
on
june
just
to
be
safe
for
the
june
due
date
in
a
fit
of
well
meant
care
bi
and
pare
lorentz
whom
she
be
just
about
to
marry
persuade
me
to
go
even
earlier
so
on
june
i
take
up
residence
in
baltimore
need
someone
for
company
in
this
strange
town
i
turn
to
my
sister
in
law
mary
meyer
who
agree
to
come
with
me
leave
her
six
month
old
son
a
deeply
generous
act
at
least
to
me
we
live
together
in
the
belvedere
hotel
in
the
june
heat
spending
any
extend
time
in
a
hotel
even
if
it
be
the
best
hotel
in
baltimore
be
difficult
but
this
be
a
hotel
in
wartime
in
a
strange
city
in
which
i
have
no
real
friend
wait
for
a
baby
to
come
who
didn
t
seem
very
anxious
to
get
here
i
quickly
become
nervous
edgy
and
vulnerable
phil
sympathize
with
my
two
year
of
pretty
constant
pregnancy
and
suggest
that
in
or
year
it
ll
all
be
over
and
there
ll
stand
the
or
grin
little
bastard
tear
up
the
furniture
spill
our
liquor
drool
on
your
new
dress
yowl
too
early
in
the
morning
and
generally
proclaim
the
solidarity
of
the
home
an
old
fashion
view
of
life
which
we
share
completely
whether
we
have
miscalculate
or
whether
the
baby
be
just
late
we
wait
restlessly
for
four
week
by
the
end
of
which
mary
whom
i
d
quite
worn
out
have
to
leave
bi
be
get
married
to
pare
and
my
family
be
all
at
mount
kisco
i
ask
a
friend
from
washington
rosamund
burling
to
come
and
wait
with
me
for
what
would
be
the
final
few
day
i
be
lucky
to
have
not
only
rosamund
in
the
father
wait
room
but
a
friend
who
be
a
pediatrician
mary
goodwin
she
be
the
one
who
lay
the
baby
across
my
stomach
and
say
it
s
a
girl
and
she
s
fine
elizabeth
morris
graham
have
finally
arrive
on
july
safe
and
sound
i
remember
my
father
s
come
to
see
me
and
his
new
grandchild
my
mother
be
at
mount
kisco
but
she
didn
t
seem
to
enter
the
picture
much
fortunately
phil
s
class
have
graduate
in
ephrata
and
he
himself
arrive
back
east
on
the
very
day
elizabeth
be
born
so
he
be
in
on
the
excitement
and
be
there
to
bring
us
home
needle
to
say
i
be
terribly
happy
to
have
the
baby
safely
here
after
the
nine
long
month
and
after
my
earlier
loss
and
to
be
together
with
phil
as
well
i
have
look
for
a
nurse
to
help
for
the
first
few
week
but
have
decide
that
i
wouldn
t
as
my
mother
have
do
keep
a
nurse
permanently
my
intention
be
to
do
it
all
myself
a
resolve
that
broke
down
almost
immediately
during
the
first
week
while
still
in
the
hospital
i
struggle
to
nurse
the
baby
after
a
futile
effort
which
set
both
me
and
the
baby
on
edge
i
abandon
the
attempt
and
put
her
on
a
formula
and
everything
go
well
the
new
baby
nurse
mary
bishop
a
scot
lady
of
great
warmth
good
humor
and
devotion
come
to
help
us
temporarily
but
just
like
powelly
with
us
meyer
child
mamie
as
we
come
to
call
her
stayed
become
part
of
all
our
life
a
real
friend
the
whole
arrangement
with
her
work
so
smoothly
that
she
didn
t
leave
us
until
the
fourth
young
graham
outgrew
her
and
she
retire
to
scotland
have
a
nurse
to
take
care
of
a
baby
except
for
its
visit
to
its
mother
twice
a
day
be
not
at
the
time
so
odd
an
arrangement
as
it
would
seem
today
but
the
presence
of
miss
bishop
undoubtedly
impede
my
learn
how
to
cope
gradually
i
take
more
care
of
elizabeth
but
i
never
learn
to
be
truly
at
ease
with
small
baby
although
i
get
well
with
each
one
in
response
to
an
airforce
memo
state
a
need
for
combat
intelligence
phil
switch
from
communication
and
be
accepted
at
the
air
intelligence
school
in
harrisburg
pennsylvania
which
be
why
he
be
able
to
be
with
me
after
the
baby
s
birth
after
life
in
the
shadow
of
lethargy
at
ephrata
he
be
cheer
by
what
he
found
in
harrisburg
a
pervasive
competence
that
lift
him
back
onto
a
plane
of
enthusiasm
after
my
six
week
checkup
i
visit
phil
in
harrisburg
for
his
last
week
there
again
he
be
high
up
in
his
class
at
graduation
and
be
ask
to
stay
on
to
teach
he
decide
to
stay
and
for
the
first
time
in
six
month
we
would
be
together
again
we
set
up
housekeep
in
harrisburg
take
thing
from
our
th
street
house
which
we
have
sublet
to
the
steichen
luckily
we
inherit
a
beautiful
apartment
from
san
francisco
friend
gay
and
jack
bradley
who
in
turn
have
succeed
jock
and
betsey
whitney
for
two
month
we
lead
an
ideal
and
spoil
life
fairly
normal
hour
and
luxurious
living
while
phil
taught
i
go
to
work
as
a
volunteer
at
the
ration
board
mamie
take
care
of
the
baby
and
mattie
take
care
of
all
of
us
but
at
the
end
of
these
two
glorious
month
the
owner
reclaim
the
apartment
and
we
met
the
cold
breeze
of
reality
when
i
start
look
for
another
place
to
live
all
we
could
find
be
a
small
apartment
in
a
recently
and
badly
built
housing
complex
with
paper
thin
wall
and
an
electric
stove
with
the
madden
habit
of
die
right
in
the
middle
of
a
roast
the
day
we
actually
move
phil
be
recover
from
a
farewell
party
we
d
host
so
i
packed
up
everything
the
last
object
be
an
inert
phil
and
get
us
to
the
new
apartment
i
didn
t
think
much
about
it
at
the
time
but
this
be
the
begin
of
a
pattern
that
i
can
see
now
be
quite
unhealthy
i
be
expect
to
perform
all
the
pull
and
haul
phil
give
direction
and
put
the
fun
in
my
life
and
the
child
s
gradually
i
become
the
drudge
and
what
s
more
accepted
my
role
as
a
kind
of
second
class
citizen
i
think
this
definition
of
role
deepen
as
time
go
on
and
i
become
increasingly
unsure
of
myself
another
development
seem
to
have
surface
way
back
then
phil
s
increase
ill
health
and
drinking
he
be
extremely
vulnerable
to
affliction
which
affected
him
powerfully
i
be
constitutionally
much
strong
if
he
get
a
cold
he
go
to
bed
if
we
both
ate
bad
seafood
it
affected
him
twice
as
much
as
it
do
me
often
he
seem
to
have
some
incapacitate
kind
of
flu
shortly
after
we
move
to
the
new
place
mattie
get
ill
and
have
to
be
hospitalize
this
be
when
i
be
force
to
learn
some
semblance
of
cooking
but
i
have
no
idea
how
to
organize
a
meal
phil
s
admonition
to
keep
it
simple
be
wise
but
only
succeed
in
irritate
me
and
make
me
more
desperate
as
i
struggle
with
fanny
farmer
not
to
mention
my
new
stove
s
penchant
for
suddenly
expire
i
always
try
to
do
too
much
end
up
with
frequent
failure
and
several
notable
disaster
mamie
be
as
helpless
in
the
kitchen
as
she
be
helpful
with
the
baby
have
live
all
her
work
life
in
large
wealthy
household
with
lot
of
servant
who
take
care
of
such
thing
as
meal
on
mamie
s
day
off
she
usually
return
to
washington
so
i
also
have
the
baby
to
care
for
on
these
day
there
be
twice
as
much
work
as
necessary
because
of
darling
mamie
s
old
fashion
notion
of
thing
like
hand
squeeze
orange
juice
and
beef
juice
as
necessity
my
own
extreme
nervousness
born
of
my
inexperience
seem
to
result
in
instant
tear
and
scream
from
the
baby
nap
be
few
and
far
between
except
when
i
push
her
in
the
baby
carriage
for
mile
up
and
down
the
street
of
harrisburg
army
life
too
be
a
series
of
ups
and
down
living
together
follow
by
another
painful
part
living
luxuriously
and
then
in
relatively
difficult
circumstance
relief
from
the
downside
of
harrisburg
arrive
in
late
january
phil
have
maneuver
to
jump
over
to
a
more
excite
and
challenge
milieu
in
the
special
branch
so
after
another
month
long
school
program
on
intelligence
training
he
be
transfer
to
washington
to
go
into
the
special
branch
a
super
secret
part
of
intelligence
run
by
an
ex
cravath
swaine
moore
lawyer
colonel
al
mccormick
who
have
commandeer
many
of
our
friend
as
well
as
many
others
who
be
to
become
friend
i
never
knew
and
probably
none
of
the
spouse
knew
what
phil
and
the
other
men
do
only
much
later
when
we
learn
that
early
in
the
war
the
secret
code
use
by
germany
and
japan
have
be
broken
do
we
understand
that
special
branch
have
be
engage
in
reading
message
be
sent
back
and
forth
from
the
field
when
we
return
to
washington
we
reclaim
our
little
row
house
on
th
street
from
the
steichen
and
resume
a
somewhat
normal
washington
life
many
of
our
friend
be
scatter
around
the
world
in
various
part
of
the
arm
service
but
still
there
be
old
friend
like
prich
and
the
frankfurter
as
well
as
my
family
then
in
october
after
almost
nine
month
of
back
to
normal
married
life
phil
as
expect
be
assign
to
the
pacific
and
have
to
leave
suddenly
the
rush
of
departure
again
have
be
so
great
that
the
familiar
low
feeling
that
always
accompany
these
leavetakings
only
hit
us
after
we
be
separate
letter
between
us

to

the
only
really
intelligent
intelligence
officer
i
have
from
the
begin
of
his
overseas
duty
phil
talk
in
excite
term
of
what
be
go
on
out
there
and
the
fine
team
of
people
he
be
assemble
he
spoke
movingly
about
all
those
with
whom
he
work
describe
them
in
detail
and
bring
them
to
life
he
constantly
praise
the
enlist
people
how
hard
they
work
how
much
he
count
on
them
and
how
much
he
appreciate
what
they
do
every
day
one
of
them
rock
me
back
on
my
heel
by
turn
up
with
some
complicate
job
they
have
dream
up
on
their
own
initiative
and
do
beautifully
they
be
all
terribly
eager
in
a
decent
non
buck
sort
of
way
and
they
love
us
and
we
them
i
always
wonder
where
phil
s
natural
affinity
for
people
in
all
walk
of
life
come
from
perhaps
it
be
grow
up
on
the
farm
or
drop
out
of
college
to
drive
the
milk
truck
and
relate
to
his
customer
as
well
as
to
the
people
on
the
farm
wherever
it
come
from
his
ability
to
cut
through
formality
and
talk
to
both
men
and
woman
almost
immediately
in
an
intimate
and
connect
way
be
an
invaluable
asset
throughout
his
life
i
learn
a
lot
from
him
in
this
respect
but
never
developed
that
almost
political
connection
he
have
with
most
people
the
post
or
at
least
clipping
from
it
which
he
receive
somewhat
irregularly
provide
phil
with
a
continue
window
on
the

view
the

and
the
world
he
also
go
on
write
to
my
father
about
his
reaction
to
the
post

coverage
and
editorial
criticize
this
or
that
praise
something
else
in
one
letter
after
complain
about
the
post
s
reaction
to
henry
wallace
then
vice
president
of
the
united
state
and
disapprove
of
an
emphasis
on
trivial
story
like
a
dog
get
a
ride
on
an
air
transport
plane
when
he
felt
there
be
more

i
go

instructive
job

of
keep

who
answer
phone
take
down
information
and
forward
it
to
the
appropriate
office
the

be
a
mess
riddle
with
backbiting
and

it
be
here
that
i
encounter
the
disagreeableness
of
see
thing
be
badly
run
with
everyone
complain
most
of
all
the

and
not

to
do
anything
about
it
the
job
taught
me
how
to
deal
with
enrage
subscriber
and
how
hard
it
be
at
time
to
get
a
simple
situation
resolve
one
caller
say
he
be
a
friend
of
eugene
meyer

and
would
go
directly
to
him
if
we
couldn
t
fix
the
problem
i
promise
to
do
our
best
then
add
that
i
be
eugene
meyer
s
daughter
and
have
never
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
this
caller
nor
have
ever
heard
his
name
mention
by
my
father
a
more
important
thing
i
learn
be
how
terrible
a
confuse
and
poorly
manage
department
be
for
those
who
work
in
it
most
of
the
winter
go
by
quietly
and
quickly
for
me
i
be
busy
with
the
routine
of
work
and
come
home
to
elizabeth
phil
write
to
my
mother
say
i
suppose
kay
be
still
as
mother
hennish
as
ever
and
bristle
when
you
bust
in
on
the
ace
at
some
crucial
time
i
love
kay
s
bristle
i
recognize
myself
in
phil
s
reference
to
my
too
great
passion
for
order
and
routine
a
boring
affliction
i
have
carry
most
of
my
life
even
though
phil
do
a
lot
to
free
me
of
it
i
wish
he
could
have
do
more
because
our
life
have
be
shape
socially
by
our
new
deal
friend
and
then
wartime
in
washington
sioux
fall
and
harrisburg
i
have
be
to
dinner
such
as
my
family
give
or
those
give
by
our
few
old
friend
but
i
myself
have
never
give
a
dinner
i
be
particularly
inept
at
do
thing
like
that
because
i
have
grown
up
in
such
a
large
household
where
everything
happen
on
a
different
huge
scale
what
i
be
use
to
be
have
a
few
friend
over
to
share
mattie
s
very
good
but
simple
food
which
she
both
cooked
and
serve
my
first
attempt
at
entertain
have
stayed
indelibly
with
me
for
half
a
century
jonathan
and
june
bingham
young
friend
who
have
move
back
to
new
york
when
the
war
broke
out
be
visit
for
the
weekend
and
i
decide
to
have
a
few
friend
over
include
prich
and
isaiah
berlin
a
relatively
new
but
close
friend
who
be
in
washington
at
this
time
as
an
information
officer
in
the
british
embassy
the
other
couple
i
invite
be
donald
and
melinda
maclean
donald
be
something
like
third
secretary
at
the
british
embassy
and
through
isaiah
the
macleans
become
friend
of
mine
the
two
of
them
seem
like
attractive
intelligent
liberal
young
people
in
short
much
like
our
own
circle
of
friend
none
of
us
could
remotely
have
suspect
that
donald
would
later
emerge
as
a
communist
spy
even
now
it
s
hard
for
me
to
comprehend
that
both
donald
and
melinda
be
soviet
agent
the
night
of
my
dinner
conversation
go
well
enough
during
the
meal
which
be
perfectly
peaceful
except
that
both
donald
and
prich
get
rather
drunker
than
i
realize
after
dinner
we
move
out
of
the
din
room
into
our
front
room
a
small
area
with
only
space
for
a
sofa
four
chair
and
a
bench
in
front
of
the
fireplace
no
sooner
have
we
settle
down
there
than
the
conversation
get
edgy
prich
and
donald
begin
to
tease
isaiah
about
his
social
life
which
they
portrayed
as
be
too
conciliatory
of
right
wing
or
isolationist
people
everyone
tease
hard
in
those
day
but
that
night
the
tease
gradually
slid
into
acrimony
and
become
unpleasant
exacerbate
no
doubt
by
prich
s
and
donald
s
alcohol
consumption
out
of
the
blue
donald
say
to
isaiah
the
trouble
with
you
be
you
hunt
with
the
hound
and
run
with
the
hare
you
know
people
like
alice
longworth
that
s
disgust
one
shouldn
t
know
people
like
that
if
i
thought
you
knew
her
out
of
curiosity
i
wouldn
t
mind
so
much
but
i
m
told
you
actually
like
her
company
that
be
dreadful
isaiah
ask
why
donald
thought
it
be
dreadful
because
she
s
fascist
and
right
wing
she
s
everything
that
s
awful
donald
spat
out
isaiah
totally
take
aback
summon
up
his
courage
and
reply
well
you
know
we
re
suppose
to
be
fight
for
civilization
civilization
entail
that
we
re
allow
to
know
anybody
we
wish
it
s
true
that
in
wartime
or
during
the
revolution
one
may
be
prepared
to
shoot
them
that
i
concede
but
so
long
as
one
doesn
t
have
to
of
course
one
must
be
judged
by
one
s
friend
i
don
t
deny
that
either
that
be
my
defense
donald
immediately
pounce
say
that
s
wrong
what
you
say
be
absolutely
false
life
be
a
battle
we
must
know
which
side
we
re
on
we
must
stick
to
our
side
through
thick
and
thin
i
know
at
the
last
moment
the
twelfth
hour
you
ll
be
on
our
side
but
until
then
you
ll
go
about
with
these
dreadful
people
isaiah
claim
that
i
then
say
he
s
absolutely
right
donald
kept
batter
isaiah
the
trouble
be
you
re
a
coward
you
know
what
s
right
and
you
know
what
s
wrong
and
you
will
not
cut
out
in
time
to
defend
the
right
cause
you
know
perfectly
well
what
i
mean
the
poor
binghams
be
flabbergast
they
didn
t
know
what
it
be
all
about
and
shuffle
around
nervously
at
one
point
i
go
upstairs
and
look
out
the
window
to
see
donald
maclean
relieve
himself
on
the
front
lawn
the
nightmare
even
seem
completely
out
of
control
finally
everyone
decide
at
once
that
it
be
time
to
go
melinda
offer
isaiah
a
lift
to
which
he
respond
no
certainly
not
donald
still
pursue
his
line
add
oh
you
wouldn
t
take
a
lift
from
us
oh
never
so
end
my
first
dinner
party
as
a
single
hostess
prich
and
i
call
isaiah
separately
after
the
dinner
apologize
for
what
have
happen
and
ask
him
what
to
do
to
heal
the
wound
i
found
him
angry
and
bruise
his
response
to
me
be
prich
have
no
manner
anyway
so
he
doesn
t
know
any
well
and
i
will
forgive
him
eventually
but
donald
maclean
do
know
well
and
i
ll
never
speak
to
him
again
year
pass
and
andrew
boyle
interview
isaiah
for
a
book
he
be
write
ask
what
make
all
those
young
men
in
cambridge
go
left
wing
isaiah
then
told
boyle
about
this
dinner
in
describe
it
he
say
he
felt
like
douglas
fairbanks
in
one
of
those
old
film
fend
off
several
of
the
enemy
at
once
the
first
edition
of
the
book
add
an
untrue
but
funny
touch
to
the
drama
of
the
even
by
solemnly
reporting
donald
maclean
turn
upon
his
stockier
colleague
and
attack
him
for
his
political
view
he
would
have
struck
him
but
douglas
fairbanks
jr
thrust
himself
between
them
that
bit
be
remove
from
the
second
edition
what
actually
happen
be
dramatic
enough
for
me
as
the
spring
of
approach
i
realize
i
would
have
to
move
our
lease
be
about
to
expire
and
our
cozy
little
house
which
we
have
be
in
off
and
on
for
almost
five
year
would
be
too
small
after
the
new
baby
come
in
april
i
have
hop
to
rent
but
there
be
little
or
nothing
to
be
have
so
i
face
buying
a
house
which
worried
me
without
phil
around
to
consult
he
be
supportive
however
say
that
he
thought
my
judgment
be
sound
agree
that
i
should
rent
if
i
could
but
buy
if
a
bargain
or
necessity
force
me
to
by
bargain
he
meant
something
irresistible
rather
than
something
for
half
price
he
also
felt
that
eventually
we
would
want
to
live
farther
out
than
georgetown
particularly
if
the
time
ever
again
come
when
there
be
sufficient
gas
to
move
around
freely
in
early
march
as
i
be
in
the
throe
of
look
for
a
house
and
near
the
due
date
for
the
baby
i
get
word
that
phil
would
be
come
back
to
washington
with
general
kenney
for
a
few
day
of
meeting
i
go
out
to
the
military
airport
to
welcome
them
when
they
arrive
on
march
in
a
c
the
first
four
engine
plane
i
have
ever
see
their
mission
which
i
certainly
wasn
t
aware
of
at
the
time
be
to
argue
that
japan
be
through
special
branch
knew
that
the
japanese
be
weaker
than
general
marshall
and
many
others
thought
the
meeting
also
have
to
do
with
the
need
for
an
immediate
invasion
of
japan
i
didn
t
believe
it
be
necessary
to
wait
for
hitler
to
fold
nor
do
we
need
help
from
the
russian
to
beat
japan
write
general
kenney
later
general
marshall
didn
t
agree
believe
the
japanese
still
have
a
lot
of
fight
left
in
them
and
certainly
a
large
army
that
would
have
to
be
defeat
initially
general
kenney
be
not
go
to
be
allow
by
the
top
brass
to
see
the
president
but
phil
through
his
friend
in
the
white
house
arrange
a
meeting
kenney
report
that
fdr
look
tire
and
gray
and
that
his
hand
shook
when
he
held
some
photo
of
corregidor
roosevelt
told
kenney
he
have
lose
twenty
five
pound
and
have
no
appetite
though
the
visit
be
excite
in
many
way
it
be
also
frantic
and
a
very
strain
reunion
for
phil
and
me
i
be
feel
the
pressure
of
look
for
a
new
house
at
the
same
time
i
be
labor
under
the
usual
stress
of
be
eight
month
pregnant
i
always
seem
to
carry
my
baby
right
out
front
and
i
produce
big
baby
and
there
be
an
early
heat
wave
which
make
me
more
miserable
than
ever
phil
be
already
strung
out
and
exhaust
from
the
long
trip
back
to
washington
on
top
of
which
he
be
busy
the
entire
week
work
about
fourteen
hour
a
day
he
spent
a
large
part
of
his
night
phone
the
family
of
his
colleague
back
in
the
philippine
so
we
didn
t
have
much
chance
to
see
each
other
i
be
dispatch
with
a
shopping
list
and
spent
my
day
run
around
town
gathering
gift
and
necessity
for
him
to
take
back
cigar
for
the
men
housecoat
bobby
pin
and
even
cotton
panty
for
the
wac
sardine
and
whiskey
for
everyone
i
then
have
to
sit
down
and
tape
the
cork
top
of
the
liquor
bottle
so
they
wouldn
t
pop
under
the
poor
pressurization
of
the
plane
on
the
return
trip
toward
the
end
of
the
week
i
beg
phil
to
look
at
a
house
i
have
found
and
settle
on
buying
a
sort
of
solid
unimaginative
but
adequate
gray
stone
house
behind
a
sears
roebuck
store
in
a
rather
nondescript
neighborhood
phil
his
mind
on
kenney
s
mission
and
not
on
house
hunt
walk
through
the
house
in
a
daze
and
uninterested
way
say
it
look
fine
to
him
and
agree
to
it
without
enthusiasm
phil
and
general
kenney
be
to
take
off
at
eight
the
next
morning
and
as
i
be
drive
phil
to
the
airport
he
told
me
that
the
real
estate
agent
have
call
him
very
embarrass
to
say
that
the
house
turn
out
to
be
in
a
restrict
area
meaning
it
be
zone
against
sale
to
either
jew
or
negro
it
take
me
totally
by
surprise
the
issue
of
my
jewish
identity
have
never
arisen
in
a
discriminatory
way
except
for
the
incident
about
club
at
the
university
of
chicago
so
i
be
more
or
less
oblivious
to
the
problem
phil
say
that
it
be
totally
illegal
and
we
could
sue
but
he
didn
t
think
i
d
want
to
do
that
on
my
own
he
then
say
i
don
t
much
like
the
house
anyway
i
m
afraid
you
ll
have
to
go
on
look
the
thought
of
extend
the
search
still
far
add
an
extra
pall
to
his
departure
so
with
the
baby
only
a
few
week
away
and
without
a
house
for
us
to
move
to
phil
flew
back
to
the
pacific
in
desperation
i
bought
the
next
house
to
come
along
one
at
rd
and
o
street
in
georgetown
a
very
odd
house
with
two
living
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
a
kitchen
and
din
room
in
the
basement
i
write
phil
that
we
have
bought
a
house
i
didn
t
much
like
for
the
first
time
i
face
pay
for
a
house
and
furnish
it
i
worried
whether
i
could
make
such
a
purchase
without
dip
into
capital
in
fact
i
didn
t
really
know
the
difference
between
capital
and
income
or
that
there
be
such
a
thing
as
a
mortgage
a
typical
example
of
my
ignorance
about
handle
money
in
my
parent
zeal
not
to
discus
money
they
neglect
ever
to
explain
what
you
could
and
couldn
t
do
with
what
you
have
nor
have
i
ever
ask
my
father
about
financing
a
house
and
he
didn
t
offer
to
tell
me
how
much
i
could
or
should
sensibly
allot
i
be
also
entirely
at
sea
about
decorate
or
how
much
it
be
appropriate
to
spend
i
found
a
decorator
a
nice
woman
who
ran
an
antique
store
a
few
block
away
from
the
new
house
she
ask
if
i
like
english
or
french
furniture
and
what
i
could
afford
i
reply
blankly
that
i
have
no
idea
what
she
be
talk
about
i
didn
t
know
there
be
a
distinction
between
english
or
french
much
less
what
either
would
cost
i
still
have
remnant
of
some
of
the
furniture
i
acquire
then
but
it
take
many
decorate
experience
and
correct
mistake
before
i
knew
how
i
want
thing
to
look
i
move
into
the
new
house
that
summer
though
it
be
considerably
large
and
harder
to
run
than
the
old
one
at
least
i
have
a
place
to
live
on
april
the
world
get
the
news
that
fdr
have
die
none
of
us
realize
how
ill
he
have
be
so
we
be
stun
it
seem
as
though
we
have
suddenly
lose
a
father
figure
in
whom
we
have
the
great
confidence
and
be
confront
by
an
unknown
relatively
inexperienced
and
seemingly
uninspiring
midwestern
former
senator
harry
truman
with
an
overwhelm
sadness
i
go
down
to
see
the
funeral
procession
that
brought
the
president
s
casket
from
the
train
to
the
white
house
a
week
later
i
go
back
to
the
belvedere
hotel
in
baltimore
my
mother
accompany
me
to
await
the
birth
of
the
new
baby
donald
edward
be
born
three
day
later
on
april
don
be
quite
unexpected
look
to
me
and
seem
to
resemble
no
one
i
knew
of
in
either
of
our
family
although
his
mouth
be
slightly
like
mine
he
be
light
in
color
and
have
not
much
hair
of
any
kind
but
such
as
there
be
be
light
brown
i
thought
he
be
quite
a
character
from
the
begin
to
commemorate
phil
s
thirtieth
birthday
my
father
write
him
an
account
of
how
he
view
our
two
child
his
letter
be
amazingly
prescient
lally
be
get
more
important
to
me
weekly
he
call
donald
judge
because
his
reaction
to
his
observation
be
calm
and
quiet
and
seem
to
be
balance
in
a
sort
of
judicial
manner
i
even
think
i
detect
in
his
eye
an
expression
of
humor
reflect
his
judgement
on
what
he
observes
i
don
t
think
anybody
be
go
to
get
him
excite
if
he
can
help
it
and
i
think
he
think
he
can
if
you
think
he
be
go
to
be
a
torch
bearer
for
any
of
the
ism
that
you
want
to
hand
him
or
try
to
instill
in
him
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
i
think
you
be
go
to
be
disappointed
on
the
other
hand
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
him
on
a
factual
basis
with
good
evidence
and
perhaps
a
witness
or
two
i
believe
you
may
interest
him
in
your
presentation
the
war
in
europe
end
on
may
but
the
war
in
the
pacific
go
on
culminate
on
august
when
the
atomic
bomb
be
drop
on
hiroshima
the
letter
phil
write
me
the
next
day
contains
his
appropriate
reaction
to
the
concept
of
the
bomb
but
no
indication
that
he
realize
it
have
be
drop
on
a
city
fill
with
civilian
donald
if
they
permit
him
can
always
point
with
pride
to
the
fact
he
get
here
just
a
little
ahead
of
the
atomic
bomb
or
the
great
achievement
of
our
scientist
industry
labor
and
military
as
someone
aptly
put
it
if
it
be
but
half
what
be
claimed
for
it
then
clearly
it
be
the
final
triumph
and
there
would
seem
to
be
no
reason
at
all
for
so
much
as
a
turnip
to
survive
the
next
one
but
on
august
he
write
again
say
that
the
first
bomb
have
scar
the
living
hell
out
of
me
most
of
september
pass
with
rumor
of
phil
s
be
sent
to
japan
but
he
thought
there
be
nothing
substantive
for
him
to
do
there
and
by
that
time
he
want
nothing
more
than
to
come
home
under
the
system
by
which
the
men
and
woman
in
the
arm
force
overseas
accumulate
point
that
put
them
in
line
for
return
home
don
have
add
six
point
to
phil
s
total
he
receive
his
order
on
september
and
be
on
a
wait
list
with
the
air
transport
command
with
a
good
chance
of
leave
within
ten
day
he
be
close
to
be
embarrass
at
get
away
so
easily
but
he
be
grateful
and
so
be
i
chapter
eleven
back
in
washington
lay
an
uncertain
future
despite
his
earlier
agreement
to
work
at
the
post
phil
still
seem
undecided
about
what
he
be
go
to
do
al
friendly
have
write
to
him
talk
about
his
own
desire
to
return
to
the
post
and
plead
with
phil
to
go
postward
at
the
end
of
august
phil
told
al
that
there
have
be
a
general
agreement
with
my
father
the
year
before
but
nothing
have
be
say
since
in
addition
phil
s
father
ernie
be
persistent
in
urge
that
he
come
to
florida
to
help
run
the
dairy
business
even
as
late
as
september
ernie
have
write
phil
about
what
he
call
the
set
up
out
here
refer
to
the
farm
at
hialeah
which
ernie
say
be
too
good
a
thing
to
be
turn
down
without
thought
somewhere
along
the
way
phil
make
up
his
mind
on
december
there
be
an
announcement
that
he
would
join
the

on

the
next
day
a

and
congratulate
the
post
on
hire
him
his
friend
obviously
want
to
tell
post
reader
that
this
be
more
than
the
publisher
s
son
in
law
that
he
have
a
demonstrably
distinguish
track
record
of
his
own
and
so
the
year
be
the
begin
of
a
new
and
drastically
alter
era
for
us
we
go
from
young
fun
love
people
with
few
responsibility
to
the
other
extreme
the
day
to
day
change
be
gradual
so
at
the
time
i
didn
t
see
how
different
our
life
be
become
but
in
fact
we
have
take
an
enormous
step
into
a
new
and
more
serious
life
after
a
terminal
leave
vacation
in
phoenix
arizona
phil
start
his
postwar
work
at
the
age
of
thirty
as
associate
publisher
of
the
post
my
father
have
say
that
he
himself
be
too
old
to
let
phil
take
an
entry
level
job
and
work
his
way
up
through
different
department
so
phil
come
into
the
paper
as
deputy
to
my
father
and
have
to
learn
an
entirely
new
and
very
competitive
business
start
essentially
at
the
top

develop
more
slowly
despite
the
help
every
day
seem
hectic
and
mamie
s
day
off
often
sent
me
into
a
tailspin
in
which
i
seem
more
than
ever
all
thumb
one
week
when
she
be
away
donny
fell
out
of
his
crib
because
i
have
left
the
side
down
and
out
of
his
swing
while
i
be
weed
the
yard
he
end
up
look
like
donald
duck
with
his
swollen
upper
lip
stick
out
an
inch
that
be
the
same
week
i
put
the
nipple
for
his
bottle
on
to
boil
and
forgot
them
while
i
take
time
out
to
call
people
for
a
party
when
the
smell
of
burning
alert
me
i
found
flame
a
foot
high
shoot
out
of
the
pan
threw
it
into
the
sink
to
put
out
the
fire
and
turn
the
water
on
only
to
have
the
pot
explode
glass
all
over
the
place
i
couldn
t
help
wonder
how
the
child
would
fare
if
i
take
care
of
them
all
the
time
at
time

a
difficult
baby

i
have
very
little
from
the
age
of
six
month
to
a
year
he
alternate
between
violent
activity
and
ensue
exhaustion
and
crankiness
it
be
often
hard
to
get
him
to
eat
one
day
when
he
have
thrown
his
entire
dinner
on
the
floor
i
be
so
desperate
that
i
ask
lally
what
to
do
with
total
common
sense
she
suggest
try
him
with
a
sandwich
i
must
say
it
work
quite
well
after
that
she
become
my
able
and
enthusiastic
assistant
even
as
a
three
year
old
lally
be
begin
to
make
a
good
deal
of
sense
she
love
be
grown
up
accompany
me
everywhere
and
be
a
marvelous
companion
with
plenty
of
humor
and
sympathy
i
be
quite
silly
about
her
and
scar
that
i
be
spoil
her
lally
and
donald
both
seem
indefatigable
and
once

acquire
a
springer

of
them
together
manage
to
keep
phil

it

it
however
we
thought
it
irresponsible
not
to
have
make
firm
arrangement
about
the
child
we
believe
scotty
and
sally
would
most
nearly
approximate

back
for
something
at
her
house
because
i
be
develop
a
pot
from
several
pregnancy
several
of
us
start
an
exercise
class
meeting
in
the
morning
at
joey
elliston
s
large
house
near
the
corner
of
th
and
r
street
one
day
joey
told
me
that
the
house
next
door
be
for
sale
and
that
phil
and
i
should
buy
it
although
we
d
be
in
our
o
street
house
less
than
a
year
we
have
begin
casually
to
look
around
for
one
well
suit
to
a
family
with
small
child
i
have
always
like
the
house
joey
be
talk
about
which
belong
to
general
wild
bill
donovan
the
outside
look
very
much
like
the
ellistons
house
an
impose
cream
color
brick
structure
but
i
thought
of
it
as
much
too
big
and
grand
for
us
and
certainly
well
beyond
our
mean
to
buy
or
to
run
it
s
not
as
big
as
it
look
joey
persist
and
you
should
look
at
it
i
do
and
it
be
love
at
almost
first
sight
it
look
like
a
comfortable
country
sort
of
house
that
the
city
have
grown
up
around
it
be
oblong
with
simple
line
and
have
a
large
expanse
of
front
lawn
a
long
pebble
driveway
an
old
fashion
back
porch
and
a
big
slop
back
yard
with
lot
of
tree
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
be
an
old
stable
that
serve
as
a
garage
with
an
apartment
over
it
with
some
trepidation
i
ask
phil
to
look
at
it
i
knew
that
if
its
size
and
the
amount
of
land
on
which
it
sat
worried
me
they
would
worry
him
more
but
i
told
him
that
in
an
ideal
world
this
be
the
house
in
which
i
would
live
one
sunday
afternoon
we
walk
up
from
o
street
as
we
pass
the
high
stone
wall
that
mark
the
property
the
wall
seem
to
loom
large
and
longer
than
ever
take
up
most
of
the
block
when
we
finally
get
to
the
flight
of
stair
up
to
the
house
from
the
side
phil
blurt
out
be
you
mad
wait
until
you
look
inside
i
mutter
nervously
it
s
much
less
grand
inside
and
it
s
not
as
bad
as
it
look
and
indeed
when
phil
saw
the
whole
house
he
too
fell
for
it
right
away
after
talk
as
if
it
be
already
ours
discuss
where
child
and
furniture
would
go
we
agree
to
try
to
buy
it
i
ask
our
agent
to
make
an
offer
of
slightly
below
the
donovans
ask
price
of
this
offer
which
be
more
than
twice
as
much
as
i
d
paid
for
the
house
we
be
leave
seem
astronomical
to
me
my
father
have
be
keep
an
eye
on
the
house
i
be
look
at
and
i
d
show
him
one
or
two
i
thought
of
interest
here
at
last
be
a
georgetown
house
he
consider
worthwhile
it
be
brick
and
therefore
solid
it
stood
alone
and
it
have
some
space
and
land
around
it
one
day
while
my
offer
be
still
outstanding
my
father
come
over
to
see
me
and
say
well
you
ve
bought
the
house
what
do
you
mean
i
ask
indignantly
i
saw
bill
donovan
at
dinner
last
night
and
ask
him
how
much
he
really
want
for
the
house
he
say
i
want
what
i
m
ask
because
that
s
what
i
ve
get
in
it
i
then
say
all
right
kay
will
pay
it
when
i
ask
him
why
he
have
interfere
with
my
bargaining
since
i
be
the
one
who
be
go
to
be
pay
he
respond
when
it
s
where
you
want
to
live
don
t
bargain
so
we
bought
the
house
and
be
always
happy
that
we
do
it
be
and
still
be
our
family
home
a
lovable
house
with
character
it
be
great
for
the
large
family
and
it
work
for
me
alone
but
from
the
start
i
quaked
at
the
thought
of
run
it
not
to
speak
of
furnish
it
in
the
begin
the
house
be
casual
to
put
it
mildly
one
of
the
two
front
room
have
be
a
sit
room
for
the
donovans
staff
and
the
room
opposite
be
a
formal
living
room
the
two
room
at
the
back
be
a
library
and
din
room
the
library
be
the
room
we
live
in
most
perhaps
because
it
s
square
and
have
a
beautiful
fireplace
as
time
go
on
i
realize
that
there
be
a
magic
to
square
room
people
be
comfortable
and
can
talk
easily
but
the
room
be
also
fine
when
you
re
alone
it
take
me
year
to
fix
up
the
front
living
room
so
it
both
look
good
and
sat
well
the
other
front
first
floor
room
become
the
child
s
din
room
playroom
and
storage
for
baby
carriage
roller
skate
baseball
and
bat
and
later
on
rock
band
equipment
because
i
ate
breakfast
there
with
the
child
phil
refer
to
it
as
the
shred
wheat
room
from
his
begin
at
the
post
phil
have
be
work
full
steam
though
he
knew
nothing
about
the
newspaper
business
or
any
business
for
that
matter
his
brain
and
ability
serve
him
well
at
once
he
become
my
father
s
close
collaborator
both
inside
the
paper
and
outside
he
join
my
father
at
the
advertising
council
which
dad
have
inspire
to
secure
the
cooperation
of
the
large
agency
and
advertiser
on
public
issue
for
the
war
effort
this
help
dad
but
also
help
phil
who
knew
no
one
in
the
newspaper
industry
or
the
business
world
either
locally
or
nationally
they
also
assume
public
obligation
together
early
in
his
presidency
harry
truman
have
ask
the
nation
to
focus
on
the
problem
of
hunger
in
postwar
europe
in
response
my
father
propose
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
a
volunteer
program
to
enlist
public
support
for
famine
relief
his
plan
become
the
one
essentially
adopt
by
truman
when
he
appoint
the
famine
emergency
committee
my
father
along
with
member
of
the
post
s
staff
then
work
to
get
newspaper
and
the
public
behind
the
idea
of
help
meet
the
need
of
the
world
s
hungry
the
committee
be
an
interest
example
of
a
cooperative
effort
between
government
and
the
press
one
that
would
be
more
difficult
today
if
not
impossible
in
general
the
press
now
see
its
role
as
cover
an
issue
like
world
hunger
and
comment
on
it
editorially
rather
than
be
a
participant
in
try
to
alleviate
it
i
wonder
if
this
isn
t
journalistically
right
but
still
a
loss
to
society
because
his
responsibility
multiply
quickly
in
the
first
few
month
phil
be
make
decision
even
while
try
to
learn
it
be
clear
that
my
father
love
have
him
there
he
be
already
a
terrific
help
with
thing
that
somebody
else
should
have
be
do
long
before
then
in
june
president
truman
call
and
ask
my
father
to
become
the
first
president
of
the
world
bank
that
night
my
parent
and
phil
and
i
din
together
to
talk
it
over
dad
be
somewhat
reluctant
to
assume
this
large
complex
job
at
the
age
of
seventy
but
he
thought
it
vitally
important
that
the
international
bank
be
launch
on
a
sound
basis
and
he
couldn
t
understand
why
other
men
be
run
from
the
outstanding
banking
opportunity
for
world
service
in
world
history
have
be
an
astute
businessman
and
government
official
for
year
dad
understood
the
situation
the
job
would
be
a
strenuous
full
time
one
require
all
his
energy
he
also
knew
that
if
he
accepted
it
he
would
have
to
make
phil
publisher
of
the
post
he
put
it
up
to
phil
say
this
have
always
be
my
primary
interest
but
if
you
don
t
want
me
to
go
i
won
t
go
of
course
phil
encourage
him
to
take
the
job
he
felt
it
be
the
right
thing
for
him
to
do
even
though
as
he
write
to
his
own
father
he
undoubtedly
deserves
a
little
rest
at
this
point
he
assure
my
father
that
both
he
and
the
post
would
be
all
right
so
on
june
the
post
announce
that
my
father
be
withdraw
from
active
direction
of
the
paper
and
would
have
no
control
or
responsibility
over
news
or
editorial
matter
although
he
do
retain
ownership
phil
would
be
publisher
in
title
and
in
fact
he
have
be
there
only
five
month
and
be
one
month
short
of
his
thirty
first
birthday
the
young
publisher
of
a
major
newspaper
in
the
united
state
my
father
s
confidence
in
phil
be
evident
in
his
comment
at
the
time
of
the
announcement
under
those
who
today
take
the
responsibility
of
its
affair
i
know
that
the
post
will
be
true
to
its
trust
the
post
will
not
only
carry
on
it
will
go
forward
although
our
friend
and
the
press
seem
to
view
phil
s
rise
to
publisher
positively
we
knew
thing
would
not
be
easy
he
have
come
into
a
job
for
which
he
be
ill
prepared
and
at
once
he
be
responsible
for
figure
out
how
to
make
the
paper
a
viable
enterprise
he
be
in
charge
of
a
lose
newspaper
in
what
be
rapidly
become
the
capital
of
the
world
indeed
the
paper
itself
be
still
struggle
for
its
life
it
have
make
profit
in
most
of
the
war
year
but
be
slide
right
back
to
loss
the
post
be
certainly
a
marginal
paper
and
it
felt
like
that
to
us
even
though
the
star
be
the
big
money
maker
our
big
competitor
because
it
be
our
direct
morning
rival
be
the
time
herald
the
post
have
continued
to
improve
in
editorial
quality
and
advertising
volume
and
general
prestige
but
there
be
a
great
deal
of
rebuild
need
after
the
war
the
competition
for
good
people
be
intense
and
it
be
a
competition
in
which
the
post
have
little
strength
the
paper
be
quite
a
small
organization
and
of
course
the
company
be
private
and
family
own
once
my
father
left
for
the
bank
phil
have
to
learn
even
faster
but
he
have
grasped
the
overall
picture
so
he
focus
on
find
the
right
people
to
carry
the
paper
forward
editorially
and
financially
some
of
the
personnel
decision
my
father
have
already
make
have
a
positive
effect
on
phil
and
a
last
effect
on
the
paper
for
example
gene
elderman

on
the
news
side
of
the
paper
believe
that
much
of

that

then
be
make
at

be
phil
s
first
journalistic
tour
and
his
first
trip

of
the
great
perk
of

life
whether

some
good
for

represent
and
for
the

by
reporting
what
you
see
and
learn
this
be
just
such
a
trip
for
phil

that
make
a
deep
impression
on
him
isaiah
berlin
always
claimed
with
some
justice
i
believe
that
it
contribute
mightily
to
phil
s
evolution
away
from
the
extreme
liberalism
of
his
law
school
day
and
the
first
few
year
after
graduation
when
we
get
back
to
washington
in
the
fall
phil
be
not
only
run
the
paper
and
work
to
improve
it
but
also
lending
moral
support
to
my
father
who
be
find
the
presidency
of
the
world
bank
even
more
burdensome
than
he
have
imagine
phil
work
hard
to
bolster
his
morale
help
him
in
every
way
he
could
from
advice
to
write
speech
trouble
at
the
bank
have
arisen
for
my
father
almost
immediately
the
twelve
director
have
be
name
earlier
and
have
be
work
together
before
his
appointment
many
resent
someone
s
come
in
really
to
impose
order
and
would
rather
have
have
a
figurehead
and
the
job
be
difficult
enough
without
the
political
infighting
dad
knew
that
if
he
stayed
and
fought
he
could
probably
win
but
he
felt
too
old
and
too
weary
to
try
toward
the
end
of
october
he
begin
think
of
the
long
term
future
of
the
bank
five
ten
or
fifteen
year
ahead
he
realize
that
he
wouldn
t
be
there
to
carry
out
his
own
plan
and
that
the
person
who
make
them
should
be
i
make
up
my
mind
he
say
that
what
the
president
and
jimmy
byrnes
have
ask
me
to
do
i
have
more
or
less
do
launch
the
bank
by
organize
it
on
december
he
tender
his
resignation
with
only
two
week
notice
not
even
have
the
energy
to
stay
until
a
successor
be
found
ironically
his
resignation
succeed
in
bring
about
some
of
the
reform
need
so
that
his
eventual
successor
john
mccloy
could
function
effectively
by
the
time
dad
return
to
the
post
in
january
a
transition
have
occur
the
six
month
of
his
absence
have
give
phil
the
chance
to
establish
his
own
authority
and
he
be
clearly
in
charge
by
the
end
of
his
first
year
he
be
omnipresent
and
involve
in
everything
my
father
take
the
title
of
chairman
of
a
nonexistent
board
and
have
the
generosity
and
wisdom
to
leave
phil
as
publisher
and
not
try
to
take
back
the
responsibility
he
have
cede
to
him
six
month
earlier
what
he
essentially
do
be
to
back
phil
in
all
that
he
be
do
so
there
begin
a
complicate
but
overall
happy
work
relationship
between
my
father
and
my
husband
and
another
between
phil
and
me
and
my
parent
the
bank
interlude
simply
brought
about
the
transition
overnight
instead
of
gradually
phil
s
respect
for
my
father
s
experience
and
knowledge
and
his
genuine
belief
in
dad
s
sound
judgment
meant
that
he
gladly
include
him
in
major
decision
and
event
in
connection
with
the
paper
in
turn
my
father
s
recognition
of
phil
s
ability
and
talent
particularly
his
facility
with
people
reinforce
his
inclination
to
support
phil
s
effort
and
to
back
the
paper
financially
my

the

she
have
with
the
management
of
the
post
in
which
phil
become
embroil
take
place
in
and
involve
an
incident
in
which
herbert
elliston
felt
she
have
interfere
with
his
work
he
protest
to
phil
note
that
it
be
the
only
occasion
he
d
have
to
complain
in
the
eight
year
he
d
be
at
the
paper
that
she
have
correct
a
proof
of
an
editorial
of
his
on
secularism
and
sent
it
directly
to
the
compose
room
herbert
felt
justly
that
she
have
overstep
her
bound
and
that
she
have
undermined
his
responsibility
for
the
editorial
page
as
well
as
his
authority
with
the
editorial
staff
not
to
mention
his
reputation
in
the
eye
of
the
men
in
the
compose
room
my
mother
be
apologetic
but
wound
she
write
to
herbert
at
once
say
that
she
be
horrify
by
the
impression
my
unfortunate
stupidity
make
upon
you
she
have
her
own
version
of
what
have
happen
explain
it
away
as
open
to
misinterpretation
but
add
dear
herbert
what
hurt
me
more
than
my
own
stupidity
be
that
you
didn
t
trust
me
enough
to
take
me
aside
when
we
met
at
dinner
and
say
to
me
frankly
and
firmly
look
here
that
s
not
the
way
to
do
thing
then
i
could
have
explain
to
you
at
once
that
i
meant
no
offense
and
apologize
on
the
spot
please
tell
phil
how
it
all
happen
and
please
don
t
bother
to
answer
this
her
true
feeling
come
out
the
next
day
when
she
write
phil
ostensibly
about
a
speech
she
be
give
on
the
modern
curriculum
and
release
time
but
throw
in
these
word
i
shall
never
again
have
any
dealing
whatsoever
with
any
post
employee
on
any
matter
whatsoever
if
i
do
any
more
about
this
the
wire
be
sure
to
get
cross
and
it
will
be
my
fault
i
refuse
ever
again
to
be
expose
to
the
humiliation
of
lecture
either
from
the
staff
or
from
you
naturally
phil
have
to
take
the
time
to
assuage
her
hurt
and
smooth
relation
for
the
future
good
of
the
paper
and
all
concerned
phil
s
diplomatic
skill
and
tact
in
deal
with
this
and
so
many
other
situation
with
my
mother
save
us
all
he
often
ran
interference
on
conflict
i
have
with
her
and
take
the
lead
in
work
out
the
personal
relationship
he
and
i
developed
with
her
and
my
father
as
my
parent
as
well
as
with
them
as
the
owner
of
the
post
and
my
father
as
his
bos
initially
during
this
period
phil
continued
to
want
me
with
him
most
of
the
time
but
it
be
he
who
determine
where
we
go
he
hat
most
formal
evening
especially
embassy
dinner
sometimes
i
beg
to
go
somewhere
that
sound
glamorous
but
he
make
the
decision
and
i
comply
what
i
hadn
t
learn
be
to
be
more
independent
of
phil
himself
paradoxically
my
mother
should
have
be
a
role
model
since
she
didn
t
operate
under
any
constraint
but
she
have
make
her
own
daughter
feel
inferior
to
her
prevent
us
in
some
way
from
view
her
as
a
positive
example
yet
even
she
with
all
her
independence
and
ego
articulate
the
importance
of
be
and
to
some
extent
live
the
life
of
a
wife
whose
primary
obligation
be
to
her
husband
and
child
after
don
s
birth
and
phil
s
return
from
overseas
i
have
not
go
back
to
work
when
phil
go
to
the
post
i
make
a
unilateral
decision
not
to
because
i
thought
it
would
be
too
confuse
for
both
of
us
to
be
there
at
once
phil
be
less
sure
that
this
be
right
and
even
encourage
me
to
come
back
early
in
his
concern
for
what
my
life
be
become
lead
him
to
suggest
that
i
start
write
a
weekly
column
that
would
be
a
review
and
digest
of
what
be
interest
in
the
magazine
its
goal
as
i
described
it
in
a
letter
to
his
sister
be
to
make
me
a
little
less
stupid
and
domestic
than
i
have
be
of
late
my
guess
be
that
he
thought
up
the
idea
to
keep
me
work
for
the
paper
but
independent
of
its
organization
actually
ever
since
phil
have
start
on
the
post
i
have
be
think
about
take
a
part
time
job
but
fear
they
didn
t
exist
this
be
a
great
one
about
which
i
felt
semi
apologetic
because
i
thought
maybe
it
be
make
work
in
fact
phil
have
picked
up
the
idea
from
another
paper
and
the
column
still
run
in
the
post
it
be
call
the
magazine
rack
and
i
begin
write
it
for
the
sunday
paper
in
april
paid
the
magnificent
sum
of
per
column
it
take
me
only
a
day
to
do
but
invariably
the
write
fell
on
a
difficult
day
and
i
be
often
in
a
panic
about
finish
it
to
my
private
surprise
however
i
enjoy
the
work
and
i
kept
it
up
for
several
year
even
pick
up
a
subscriber
along
the
way
the
louisville
courier
journal
courtesy
of
our
friend

quite
correct
washington

who
later
do
convert
this
home
into
a
really
useful
institution
at
which
time
i
participate
more
happily
i
be
also
preoccupy
with
deal
with
our
small
child
in
those
day
and
in
our
situation
there
be
no
share
of
duty
between
parent
i
do
absolutely
everything
domestic
found
the
school
and
supervise
the
child
s
activity
kept
the
social
calendar
for
all
of
us
once
phil
have
decide
what
he
and
i
would
attend
and
decorate
the
house
i
also
be
the
one
who
have
to
see
to
repair
and
renovation
in
when
lally
be
four
i
get
her
into
a
nursery
school
which
i
described
as
veddy
veddy
modern
whose
application
process
presage
something
of
what
today
s
parent
go
through
i
be
ask
all
sort
of
odd
question
such
as
do
i
think
my
home
training
have
be
successful
i
roar
with
laughter
and
say
i
didn
t
know
but
i
suppose
not
they
also
ask
me
what
i
want
her
to
get
out
of
nursery
school
which
i
couldn
t
answer
successfully
either
i
be
never
sure
why
they
admit
her
certainly
not
on
the
basis
on
my
response
but
decide
it
have
to
be
the
result
of
the
test
they
give
her
in
which
she
successfully
put
block
together
what
to
do
in
the
summer
be
something
i
struggle
with
during
these
year
usually
i
take
the
child
to
mount
kisco
to
visit
my
parent
but
my
feeling
be
invariably
mixed
about
go
to
seven
spring
farm
i
knew
the
child
would
love
it
as
indeed
they
always
do
and
as
i
have
as
a
child
but
i
didn
t
like
the
idea
of
leave
phil
in
washington
to
commute
there
for
weekend
and
since
he
work
all
week
with
my
father
i
thought
he
might
need
a
break
from
my
family
on
weekend
i
be
also
concerned
about
my
mother
s
relation
with
my
child
and
how
she
view
their
upbringing
she
act
as
though
they
have
never
eat
so
well
in
their
life
as
when
they
be
at
her
house
and
there
be
also
an
unending
comparison
between
our
child
and
my
brother
s
child
who
be
often
there
too
in
those
year
this
set
up
a
tense
competition
between
the
family
but
bad
of
all
my
mother
developed
favorite
among
the
grandchild
at
different
time
in
their
life
a
favoritism
she
displayed
with
an
astound
lack
of
sensitivity
once
she
come
into
the
din
room
where
the
child
be
have
an
early
dinner
and
say
lally
i
brought
you
a
flower

will
never
forget

able

and
percent
own
by
cbs
privately
phil
be
delirious
with
excitement
it
be
the
real
moment
of
the
post
s
entry
into
a
new
business
world
and
into
the
electronic
world
on
the
even
of
my
talk
with
ruth
stanton
on
our
back
porch
we
go
to
a
cocktail
party
in
honor
of
margaret
truman
there
be
the
usual
amount
of
stand
around
and
i
begin
to
feel
contraction
start
and
told
phil
i
thought
the
baby
might
be
come
when
he
ask
how
i
knew
i
realize
that
this
be
the
first
time
he
be
really
involve
with
a
baby
s
birth
it
be
his
third
child
and
he
still
didn
t
know
what
happen
i
didn
t
want
to
leave
for
john
hopkins
and
find
out
i
be
mistaken
but
when
the
contraction
grow
strong
we
set
out
have
reserve
a
hotel
room
in
baltimore
in
case
this
be
false
labor
about
halfway
there
i
suggest
that
the
hospital
be
indicate
phil
speed
up
and
we
make
it
with
only
twenty
minute
to
spare
before
thing
get
serious
i
have
ask
my
doctor
about
natural
childbirth
which
have
begin
to
be
in
vogue
and
when
he
insist
that
it
wasn
t
for
me
i
take
this
as
a
challenge
even
though
i
hadn
t
have
any
of
the
training
involve
i
make
a
resolve
to
have
this
baby
without
anesthesia
if
i
could
but
not
to
say
anything
in
case
i
couldn
t
there
be
certain
experience
childbirth
be
one
move
be
another
that
nature
and
time
definitely
draw
a
curtain
on
so
you
forget
in
between
time
how
painful
they
be
in
this
case
after
four
hour
i
be
about
ready
to
give
up
when
the
doctor
say
if
you
can
stand
one
more
contraction
you
can
have
the
baby
although
i
be
convince
i
be
explode
i
do
and
our
second
son
be
born
it
be
indeed
traumatic
and
i
kept
relive
the
sensation
for
some
week
after
but
i
be
pleased
at
have
do
it
this
way
i
be
even
more
pleased
with
the
reality
of
william
graham
whom
we
give
the
middle
name
welsh
after
phil
s
grandmother
who
regard
phil
or
at
least
so
he
claimed
as
her
favorite
grandchild

baby
and
i
return
home
six
day
later
to
a
haven
on
our
third
floor
where
we
be

television
set
people

there
be
a
good
deal
of
intellectual
snobbery
in
georgetown
about
have
one

all
our
first

edit
by

my

it
still
move
me
in
its
honest
expression
of
my
father
s
belief
about
what
he
have
try
to
do
with
the
post
over
the
previous
fifteen
difficult
year
to
survive
a
newspaper
must
be
a
commercial
success
at
the
same
time
a
newspaper
have
a
relation
to
the
public
interest
which
be
different
from
that
of
other
commercial
enterprise
this
be
more
than
ever
apparent
in
these
day
when
our
free
institution
be
under
their
severest
trial
and
closest
scrutiny
the
citizen
of
a
free
country
have
to
depend
on
a
free
press
for
the
information
necessary
to
the
intelligent
discharge
of
their
duty
of
citizenship
that
be
why
the
constitution
give
newspaper
express
protection
from
government
interference
it
be
also
possible
for
the
public
interest
to
be
defeat
by
the
way
a
newspaper
be
conduct
since
the
principal
restraint
upon
a
newspaper
owner
be
his
self
restraint
phil
and
i
both
sign
a
formal
letter
to
my
father
that
read
you
have
discuss
with
us
your
idea
concern
the
washington
post
and
we
be
of
course
familiar
with
the
provision
of
the
amendment
of
the
certificate
of
incorporation
of
the
washington
post
company
that
be
to
be
make
in
order
to
insure
as
far
as
possible
that
those
idea
shall
be
perpetuate
we
be
very
gratify
that
you
have
decide
that
it
will
be
consistent
with
your
hope
for
the
future
of
the
post
for
us
to
be
the
owner
of
the
voting
share
of
the
company
and
that
you
have
therefore
agree
to
sell
your
holding
of
class
a
stock
to
us
on
his
birthday
that
year
just
before
this
announcement
phil
receive
as
a
gift
from
my
parent
though
my
mother
sent
it
with
a
note
say
she
be
give
it
to
him
as
a
birthday
and
wedding
anniversary
present
with
all
my
affection
it
be
really
to
help
him
buy
his
share
of
the
stock
in
the
post
phil
and
i
each
already
have
share
of
class
a
common
stock
of
the
company
which
have
be
give
to
us
by
my
mother
in
november
we
bought
the
other
share
from
my
father
at
per
share
in
effect
share
be
transfer
to
phil
and
share
be
transfer
to
me
give
us
a
total
of
voting
share
phil
receive
the
large
share
of
the
stock
because
as
dad
explain
to
me
no
man
should
be
in
the
position
of
work
for
his
wife
curiously
i
not
only
concur
but
be
in
complete
accord
with
this
idea
two
year
later
the
transition
to
us
be
complete
with
the
gift
of
the
rest
of
the
share
to
the
eugene
and
agnes
meyer
foundation
which
have
be
set
up
in
the
foundation
have
be
a
very
small
one
make
politically
and
economically
much
large
by
the
acquisition
of
the
b
share
it
be
set
up
very
carefully
to
be
independent
in
its
administration
and
not
a
tool
for
the
family
s
use
this
be
carry
out
perhaps
overly
zealously
to
the
extent
that
my
father
could
not
get
the
foundation
to
do
anything
even
remotely
connect
to
his
interest
by
now
there
be
no
connection
at
all
between
the
family
and
the
foundation
but
it
have
be
an
effective
force
in
the
washington
area
in
order
to
make
thing
equitable
for
my
sibling
who
would
not
be
gain
ownership
of
the
paper
my
parent
give
an
equal
amount
of
money
to
them
at
this
time
there
be
a
few
tense
moment
when
my
father
told
them
about
the
arrangement
but
nothing
like
the
difficulty
that
be
to
develop
in
other
newspaper

my
brother
have
some
second
thought

with
his
decision

any
more
stock
when

lonely

she
have

there

plenty
of

most
important
for

as
the

cissy

more
liberal

he
left
mount
kisco
almost
immediately
to
start
talk
with
the
seven
heir
about
their
intention
because
of
estate
tax
consideration
the
inheritor
felt
they
have
only
a
year
in
which
to
decide
whether
to
keep
the
paper
and
continue
to
operate
it
or
to
sell
it
we
all
knew
there
be
too
many
paper
in

we
also
knew
that
only
one
of
the

likely
to
survive
it
be
with
this
knowledge
that
phil
begin
to

with
shelton

be
now
the

then
incorporate
my
father
would
no
longer
pay
its
loss
which
increase
phil
s
already
heavy
obligation
to
make
the

viable
it
be
another
of
those
crucial
moment
another
big
step
in
the

overnight
we
become

chapter
twelve
even
recognize
how
far
the

have
come
from
the

my

bought
in
what
we
own

we

the

practically
no

have
begin

a
familiar
pre

together
phil

a
national
staff
that

still
thin

begin

early
on

for
the
fact
molly
s
suggestion
that
her

the
most
colossal
impertinence
i

a

to
check
the
spell
and
address

by
chance
he
have
return
from

war
and
start
a
newspaper
in
new
hampshire
which
do
pretty
well

in
the
end
as
with
many
such
venture
it
fold
leave

he
have
two

come
on

at
a
week
only
three
year
later
ben
go
to
phil
and
say
he
d
like
to
be
a
nieman
fellow
which
meant
go
to
harvard
for
a
year
under
a
special

for
journalist
to
which
phil
retort
why
you

quit
and
take
a
job
as
information
officer
in
the
united
state
embassy
in

it
be
too
stultify
for
him
and
soon
he
go
to
newsweek

paris
bureau
in
many
way
phil
be
at
his
very
best
as
a

in
these
year
he
spark
idea
praise
and
persuade

and
cajole
as
he
go
about
his
more
than
full
time
chore
of
administration
and
policymaking
he
worried
constantly
about
the
difficulty
that
confront
him
as
owner
and
publisher
he
be
acutely
aware
of
the
dilemma
that
arose
from
the
fact
that
a
newspaper
must
be
a
successful
commercial
enterprise
in
order
to
survive
yet
the
publisher
must
realize
that
he
have
obligation
which
transcend
any
commercial
interest
he
believe
that
despite
the
difficulty
involve
it
be
best
for
the
publisher
to
have
an
ownership
part
in
a
paper
and
not
merely
represent
absentee
ownership
as
a
hire

almost
completely
a

of

performance
he
insist
that

should
not
brush
off
our
defect
by
blithely
say
that
people
can
cancel
their
subscription
if
they
disagree
since
in
many
city
there
be
no
choice
he
worried
continually
about
basic
news
reporting
and
how
to
do
a
well
job
of
bring
news
to

in
a
speech
he
give
at
the

cut
a

the

would
run
on

of
the

unless
the
people
with
the

about

integrate
the
pool
they
agree
shut
down
the
pool
in
the
middle
of
that
hot
summer
but
promising
to
reopen
the
follow
summer
on
an
integrate
basis
which
they
do
this
be
a
typical
example
of
the
way
phil
use
power
in
this
case
the
paper
s
to
accomplish
something
good
it
work
but
at
the
same
time
it
hurt
the
paper
it
isn
t
and
probably
wasn
t
even
then
the
way
to
run
a
newspaper
to
keep
a
story
out
of
the
paper
to
achieve
a
purpose
even
a
fine
one
be
neither
appropriate
nor
in
the
spirit
of
my
father
s
definition
of
the
duty
of
a
newspaper
to
try
to
tell
the
truth
to
find
it
out
and
tell
it
to
have
a
competent
editorial
department
to
interpret
that
truth
from
the
time
of
cissy
patterson
s
sudden
death
in
until
the
follow
summer
the
most
important
activity
in
which
phil
be
involve
be
his
unrelenting
attempt
to
buy
the
time
herald
we
believe
that
our
life
or
rather
the
company
s
life
and
the
life
of
the
post
depend
on
our
acquire
it
others
we
knew
who
be
interested
include
william
randolph
hearst
jr
the
ever
eager
samuel
newhouse
and
the
scripps
howard
organization
which
own
another
one
of
our
competitor
the
washington
daily
news
phil
felt
he
have
a
real
chance
because
cissy
patterson
s
cousin
colonel
robert
mccormick
the
editor
and
publisher
of
the
chicago
tribune
show
no
interest
in
the
time
herald
at
the
time
and
it
be
worth
more
to
us
than
to
any
of
the
others
from
the
begin
bill
shelton
the
time
herald
s
general
manager
agree
that
we
be
the
one
who
ought
to
get
it
but
he
also
felt
that
frank
waldrop
who
have
be
closest
to
cissy
and
be
most
loyal
to
her
memory
be
likely
to
be
a
fly
in
the
ointment
how
big
a
fly
i
never
knew
until
recently
waldrop
have
not
only
work
for
cissy
patterson
but
respect
her
indeed
love
her
he
felt
he
owe
her
everything
and
he
admire
her
gut
the
fact
that
she
be
really
try
all
the
time
try
right
up
to
the
day
she
die
shelton
and
phil
sometimes
with
waldrop
held
regular
negotiation
until
summer
when
the
year
of
decision
would
be
up
when
the
heir
decide
to
sell
phil
and
my
father
make
a
secret
write
proposal
to
the
seven
executive
offering
million
in
addition
my
father
put
up
another
million
for
the
chicago
tribune
stock
that
be
in
cissy
s
estate
with
the
understand
that
he
would
help
the
executor
liquidate
it
something
shelton
and
waldrop
have
ask
for
take
whatever
colonel
mccormick
didn
t
want
that
summer
we
rent
a
house
in
narragansett
rhode
island
phil
commute
on
the
weekend
always
tire
and
nervous
over
the
negotiation
on
top
of
all
his
other
work
i
often
would
remove
the
child
from
the
small
house
so
he
could
sleep
i
remember
take
them
outside
on
one
cold
rainy
saturday
for
what
i
described
to
them
hopefully
as
a
picnic
breakfast
just
to
make
sure
we
wouldn
t
wake
him
on
the
weekend
before
the
negotiation
be
to
become
final
just
before
phil
be
to
leave
for
washington
he
and
i
sat
on
the
beach
alone
talk
and
dream
i
vividly
recall
his
say
i
know
get
the
time
herald
would
be
too
good
to
be
true
it
s
too
much
to
hope
for
but
just
let
s
shut
our
eye
for
a
moment
and
pretend
we
have
it
the
first
thing
i
d
like
to
see
be
sam
kauffmann
s
face
when
he
hears
the
news
after
we
d
indulge
ourselves
this
way
for
a
while
he
realistically
and
soberly
say
if
we
don
t
get
it
i
ll
die
for
a
week
then
i
ll
try
to
think
of
do
it
another
way
we
be
cautious
but
we
couldn
t
help
hop
that
this
would
be
the
end
of
the
long
hard
struggle
phil
call
me
early
the
next
morning
with
the
news
that
colonel
mccormick
have
step
in
and
bought
the
paper
he
ask
me
to
break
up
the
house
there
take
the
child
to
mount
kisco
and
come
down
to
be
with
him
weep
i
sat
at
breakfast
with
the
child
before
i
begin
the
move
to
join
him
in
washington
what
we
didn
t
understand
at
the
time
be
that
we
might
have
get
the
paper
at
that
point
if
not
for
frank
waldrop
s
loyalty
to
cissy
s
aim
and
aspiration
yes
we
be
willing
to
pay
the
most
for
the
paper
which
pleased
the
other
six
heir
but
waldrop
believe
it
would
frustrate
cissy
s
intent
he
felt
it
would
have
be
a
betrayal
and
surrender
a
sentence
of
death
for
the
time
herald
so
he
told
the
other
heir
do
as
you
wish
but
i
m
not
go
to
sign
it
waldrop
make
sure
the
colonel
heard
about
my
father
s
willingness
to
take
care
of
the
tribune
stock
unfortunately
mccormick
interpret
this
not
as
something
helpful
but
as
a
threat
to
his
total
control
of
the
great
enterprise
and
he
step
in
and
bought
the
time
herald
for
just
what
we
have
offer
phil
and
my
father
try
to
raise
their
offer
mother
always
magnificent
in
a
crisis
and
want
to
ensure
the
future
of
the
post
call
from
mount
kisco
to
say
that
if
the
sale
hinge
on
the
amount
we
be
offering
then
she
didn
t
need
to
live
so
elaborately
eugene
throw
in
the
house
nothing
else
matter
she
really
meant
it
we
all
have
our
heart
and
soul
in
this
deal
however
the
tribune
and
time
herald
people
actually
hid
from
our
lawyer
to
prevent
be
present
with
our
high
bid
and
we
never
really
get
the
chance
to
up
the
ante
when
i
arrive
in
washington
i
found
phil
in
a
great
despond
we
both
thought
the
future
much
dimmer
if
not
hopeless
now
we
be
face
with
the
great
rich
highly
professional
and
profitable
chicago
tribune
company
as
our
competitor
with
the
colonel
whose
business
acumen
be
widely
know
and
respect
have
seemingly
unlimited
asset
to
pour
into
oppose
us
more
than
ever
we
thought
in
term
of
a
battle
for
survival
now
against
goliath
one
night
a
week
or
so
after
the
takeover
i
woke
up
at
two
in
the
morning
to
find
phil
smoking
and
finish
a
book
he
have
obtain
from
the
library
on
the
life
and
career
of
newspaper
magnate
colonel
mccormick
and
captain
joe
patterson
phil
say
you
know
they
put
the
company
together
when
they
be
in
their
thirty
now
they
re
in
their
sixty
and
i
m
in
my
thirty
i
think
we
can
make
it
another
way
with
that
simple
conclusion
phil
get
over
the
terrible
blow
of
be
defeat
in
a
deal
on
which
we
thought
our
life
depend
and
so
the
struggle
for
survival
continued
absorb
all
phil
s
energy
and
attention
the
post
continued
to
grow
in
quality
and
influence
and
even
in
some
important
business
measure
like
circulation
but
lose
ground
on
others
like
advertising
these
be

we
move
steadily

the
fourth

be
still
perk
along
in
its
own
niche
which
be
largely
lunch
counter
and
street
sale
what
we
try
to
do
at
the
post
be
to
reach
the
average
reader
in
contrast
to
the
star
which
be
gear
to
the
city

power
structure
and
a
middle

upper

to

appeal

blue
collar
downscale
and
upper
crust
lover
of
scandal
and
gossip
phil
obviously
kept
an
eye
out
for
the
competition
but
he
felt
as
do
my
father
that
improve
our
own
paper
be
the
surest
way
to
improve
our
chance
of
survival
as
rus
wiggins
remember
we
didn
t
really
get
into
slug
match
in
the
old
partisan
newspaper
tradition
we
cover
the
news
in
competition
with
them
but
we
didn
t
get
into
vituperative
dispute
and
this
attitude
of
honest
competition
played
an
important
role
then
and
later
on
the
business
side
phil
succeed
in
hire
a
first
class
circulation
manager
harry
gladstein
from

los
angeles
examiner
this
position
have
be
a
revolve
door
of
incompetence
and
amateurism
so
gladstein
s
arrival
late
in
help
solve
a
problem
that
have
be
a
sore
spot
from
the
begin
but
phil
s
most
important
business
recruit
be
john

come
as

eventually

impressed
with
your

with
his
wisdom
his

his
strong
personality
and
the
same
with
phil
i
put
my
future
in

really
for
his
part
phil
be
certain
we
have
found

a
prize
package
and
felt
as
he
once
say
aren
t
i
a
lucky
son
of
a
bitch
this
guy
could
run

after
a
short
while
phil
give
john
great
autonomy
in
effect
say
you
run
the
business
side
of
the

and
i
ll
back
you
up
john
immediately
set
to
work
redesign

and
cleaning
up
the
organization
he
brought
in
a
great
production
manager
harry
eybers
and
a
fine
classify
advertising
manager
jim
daly
this
be
the
nucleus
of
the
team
together
with
don
bernard
and
harry
gladstein
that
brought
us
such
success
later
john
be
very
strong
and
dominate
at
time
he
be
at
loggerhead
with
various
editor
or
executive
on
the
news
side
particularly
rus
wiggins
who
want
to
do
some
thing
that
require
money
which
john
basically
didn
t
like
to
spend
he
be
famous
for
focus
on
cost
cut
measure
which
many
others
look
on
as
mere
penny
pinch
but
in
the
end
it
be
john
s
single
mind
pursuit
of
cost
cut
and
revenue
generate
move
that
help
turn
the
situation
around
indeed
under
john
s
direction
and
because
of
his
introduction
of
more
professional
business
management
we
start
to
make
very
real
gain
in
circulation
and
in
advertising
he
also
focus
on
building
the
sunday

one
of
the

the
immediate
plunge
my
father
and
phil
take
with
the
decision
to
build
a
new
plant
when
dad
bought
the
post
someone
ask
him
if
he
be
go
to
build
a
new
building
a
natural
question
give
the
look
of
the
post

his
response
however
be
no
i
m
go
to
try
to
build
a
newspaper
first
have
do
that
he
be
ready
to
move
on
to
provide
a
well
operating
environment
for
the
grow
paper
at
the
time
the

eight
hundred

have
spill

of
the
fifty
six
year
old

into
three
other
building
the
paper
be
handicapped
by
the
inadequacy
of
both
its
building
and
its
equipment
and
there
be
no
room
to
expand
production
capacity
land
have
be
acquire
in
another
section
of
the
city
on
l
street
between
th
and
th
with
additional
space
behind
the
new
building
which
phil
consider
the
most
important
step
affect
the
paper
since
as
well
as
a
testimonial
to
our
faith
in
its
future
be
make
possible
financially
by
loan
from
my
parent
for
the
million
cost
of
the
project
we
be
still
there
with
expansion
more
than
forty
five
year
later
when
the
new
building
be
halfway
up
phil
call
in
my
mother
and
me
to
more
or
less
sign
off
on
the
interior
design
consult
us
on
decor
be
not
a
great
idea
since
neither
of
us
have
a
very
good
eye
or
track
record
in
this
area
even
so
i
have
definite
opinion
about
what
i
saw
and
say
i
thought
it
be
hideous
phil
expect
quick
approval
be
understandably
irritated
he
say
all
right
if
you
don
t
like
it
then
do
something
about
it
find
someone
to
do
the
interior
i
get
the
name
of
an
interior
designer
mary
barnes
who
make
a
great
impact
rectify
some
of
the
bad
mistake
and
put
a
presentable
look
on
the
building
because
many
of
the
color
she
chose
be
mute

on
the
post
refer
to
her
as
the
gray
lady
groundbreaking
take
place
late
in
and
the
first
full
paper
be
print
at
the
new
l
street
site
in
november
there
be
a
very
alcoholic
emotional
party
as
everyone
finally
left
the
old
e
street
building
behind
the
party
more
of
a
wake
actually
be
as
someone
put
it
to
mourn
the
death
of
a
building
which
with
all
its
inconvenient
horror
be
still
much
love
in
fact
many
longtime
employee
be
less
than
enthusiastic
about
move
from
the
dingy
but
bustling
e
street
plant
into
the
spic
and
span

of
the
quiet

the
new

double
our
press
capacity
while
provide
modern
convenience
like
air
conditioning
soundproof
and
a
clean
environment
but
it
look
cold
and
impersonal
in
contrast
to
the
old
one
post
old
timer
be
quote
say
it
ll
be
all
right
once
we
get
to
spit
on
the
floor
again
at
the
same
time
that
phil
be
work
on
plan
for
the
new
building
and
expand
the
post
editorially
he
be
work
hard
to
build
the
business
for
year
my
father
have
simply
subsidize
the
paper
s
loss
out
of
his
pocket
but
after
the
a
share
be
pass
to
us
we
couldn
t
do
that
any
longer
luckily
for
us
the
loss
have
greatly
decline
and
the
radio
station
we
own
with
cbs
be
profitable
phil
always
thought
of
radio
and
television
not
as
rival
of
newspaper
but
rather
as
another
form
of
journalism
and
very
early
he
recognize
their
potential
for
bring
profit
to
offset
any
loss
the
paper
might
incur
in
again
with
cbs
as
a
partner
phil
take
the
company
into
the
television
field
by
buying
a
station
in
washington
woic
whose
call
letter
be
later
change
to
wtop
since
there
be
cash
in
wtop
we
have
to
come
up
with
only
or
percent
of
the
remain
amount
of
the
million
purchase
price
of
which
cbs
paid
the
other
percent
my
parent
loan
us
the
money
for
our
share
of
this
purchase
phil
write
to
his
father
at
the
time
i
think
our
timing
be
just
about
perfect
for
it
look
as
though
television
here
will
move
out
of
the
red
ink
this
fall
we
be
anxious
to
get
in
because
it
be
go
to
have
great
effect
on
all
other
medium
and
especially
on
radio
since
when
he
have
drawn
us
into
radio
frank
stanton
have
become
a
close
personal
friend
as
well
as
a
business
associate
late
in
frank
told
phil
that
the
three
owner
who
have
start
the
only
television
station
in
jacksonville
florida
wmbr
want
to
sell
about
a
month
before
the
election
in
phil
set
the
wheel
in
motion
that
lead
to
his
purchase
of
the
station
ten
day
after
the
election
we
left
on
vacation
stop
first
in
jacksonville
where
he
complete
the
deal
and
met
glenn
marshall
one
of
the
original
owner
who
be
stay
on
to
manage
the
station
glenn
remember
that
when
wmbr
go
on
the
air
originally
in
there
wasn
t
a
television
set
in
the
whole
of
jacksonville
and
the
station
owner
would
call
dealer
daily
to
see
if
any
set
have
be
sell
that
day
the
price
phil
have
agree
to
million
be
the
high
ever
paid
for
a
television
station
at
that
time
i
believe
this
be
the
first
time
phil
be
out
ahead
of
my
father
who
be
slightly
nervous
about
the
propose
purchase
it
take
a
call
from
don
swatland
dad
s
friend
and
a
lawyer
at
cravath
the
corporate
law
firm
in
new
york
to
reassure
him
that
it
be
a
good
idea
actually
it
turn
out
to
be
a
great
idea
phil
always
refer
to
wjxt
wmbr
s
call
letter
be
change
in
as
his
rabbit
s
foot
the
station
built
up
enormous
strength
while
it
be
alone
in
the
field
in
fact
it
be
the
only
vhf
station
between
atlanta
and
miami
the
newspaper
in
jacksonville
own
by
the
railroad
be
second
rate
so
the
town
come
to
rely
on
wjxt
as
the
principal
source
for
news
and
this
remain
the
case
for
many
year
until
nbc
go
on
the
air
with
a
station
that
have
twelve
owner
provide
negligible
competition
even
today
with
massive
competition
wjxt
remains
dominant
in
the
market
after
john
sweeterman
come
and
begin
to
take
hold
of
the
business
side
of
the
company
phil
be
freer
to
turn
his
attention
to
news
and
editorial
on
the
news
side
he
would
have
like
to
have
correspondent
overseas
and
felt
the
post
wouldn
t
be
do
a
proper
job
in
the
capital
until
we
manage
that
many
of
the
editorial
issue
with
which
the
post
be
deal
have
to
do
with
the
increase
anxiety
about
communism
in
those
year
after
world
war
ii
the
political
right
kept
manipulate
america
s
fear
in
a
demagogic
way
and
the
atmosphere
grow
more
poisonous
as
the
cold
war
grow
more
intense
the
fear
of
communism
on
which
joseph
mccarthy
and
the
political
right
fed
just
a
few
year
later
be
palpable
everywhere
and
the
post
take
strong
stand
from
the
begin
which
wasn
t
easy
for
a
paper
operating
on
the
economic
fringe
and
fight
for
its
life
the
attack
on
us
for
be
liberal
or
even
red
begin
then
and
rarely
cease
over
the
next
several
year
add
greatly
to
both
our
financial
problem
and
our
distinction
there
be
of
course
genuine
strong
reason
for
anticommunism
both
at
home
and
abroad
at
home
the
party
have
succeed
in
establish
a
surprising
network
of
infiltrator
and
even
spy
abroad
the
soviet
be
be
very
aggressive
all
over
europe
especially
in
berlin
and
in
the
communist
take
over
in
czechoslovakia
obviously
there
be
real
concern
but
the
political
exploitation
and
misuse
of
them
be
shameless
the
post
have
begin
to
cover
the
house
committee
on
un
american
activity
or
huac
by
the
end
of
we
be
under
fairly
constant
attack
for
our
attitude
toward
the
committee
s
activity
and
the
editor
felt
the
need
to
respond
to
those
attack
one
editorial
put
the
post
s
position
succinctly
this
newspaper
s
criticism
of
the
committee
have
be
direct
consistently
at
its
method
rather
than
at
its
aim
because
the
committee
under
successive
chairmanship
have
equate
loyalty
with
conformity
have
concerned
itself
with
opinion
rather
than
activity
have
disregard
the
most
elementary
rule
of
fair
play
in
deal
with
witness
its
conduct
have
seem
to
us
to
be
more
dangerously
un
american
than
that
of
any
of
the
group
or
individual
it
have
investigate
an
article
that
appear
in

as
a
trojan
horse
for
totalitarianism
follow
the
communist
party
line
on
most
major
issue
and
assail
phil
especially
as
a
constant
apologist
for
the

unmistakably
the

phil
be
so

that

consider
legal
action
dismiss
the
idea
only
when
he
learn
that

instead
he
write
an
eight
page

our

several
scathing
letter
include

write
the

be
the
equal
of
the

herald
in
its

column
i
think
alger
have
a
lot
of
explain
to
do
why
not
let
him
make
it
in
the
forum
of
the
baltimore
court
and
keep
your
bias
out
of
the
piece
until
then
all
i
suggest
be
objectivity
i
don
t
know
the
answer
but
neither
do
the

and
i
expect
more
of
the

than
other
paper
phil
respond
agree
that
rowe
have
caught
us
with
our
objectivity
down
but
add
there
be
no
bad
intention
involve
just
some
silly
judgment
and
we
be
wistfully
hop
that
we
shall
learn
from
experience
on
the
other
hand
we
be

a

and
a
free

implies
a

feel
these
truth
very
deeply
there
have
be
instance
in
the
past
as
there
will
doubtless
be
in
the
future
when
i
have
vigorously
defend
you
against
the
charge
of
responsibility
for
editorial
view
that
for
one
reason
or
another
arouse
criticism
on
the
part
of
friend
of
yours
the
occasion
for
these
remark
be
of
course
the
editorial
in
this
morning
s
post
conflict
of
loyalty
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
the
view
which
it
express
run
counter
to
many
deep
conviction
of
mine
not
the
least
my
conviction
about
the
duty
of
the
press
to
worry
l
uninformed
people
will
disregard
weigh
word
or
that
yammerers
in
our
midst
will
make
a
misuse
of
them
and
therefore
to
deplore
a
manifestation
of
moral
clarity
be
to
join
the
misinform
and
the
yammerers
i
have
suppose
that
the
press
enjoys
its
constitutional
status
because
its
duty
be
to
enlighten
and
not
to
submit
to
darkness
the
hiss
case
dominate
all
our
mind
it
be
all
we
seem
to
talk
about
one
night
scotty
and
sally
reston
come
to
dinner
and
as
they
sat
down
in
our
library
and
reach
for
a
drink
scotty
say
shall
we
talk
about
something
else
for
five
minute
or
shall
we
get
right
down
to
business
so
contrary
to
the
perception
of
those
attack
us
from
the
right
that
the
post
be
a
liberal
left
lean
paper
we
be
be
assail
by
those
on
the
left
who
felt
we
be
too
conservative
and
not
vigilant
enough
in
speak
out
against
right
wing
excess
and
in
defense
of
civil
liberty
in
fact
there
be
a
mixture
of
view
on
the
editorial
page
but
herbert
elliston
and
phil
be
the
decide
voice
the
post
indeed
have
sympathize
with
alger
hiss
during
the
early
stage
of
his
trial
but
as
more
and
more
evidence
come
to
light
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
be
a
cool
and
cynical
perjurer
the
year
be
the
first
election
year
for
phil
and
me
as
control
owner
of
the
post
and
we
go
together
to
both
political
party
convention
that
summer
convention
be
fascinate
to
attend
as
journalist
and
certainly
as
publisher
more
so
then
than
now
when
everything
be
decide
in
the
primary
to
find
out
what
s
go
on
behind
the
scene
you
have
to
know
people
and
be
able
to
maneuver
in
crowd
to
meet
and
exchange
view
with
politician
and
journalist
from
all
over
the
country
in
we
be
still
young
and
the
post
be
still
relatively
unknown
everyone
else
look
important
to
me
and
phil
and
i
go
around
with
my
father
but
even
he
be
somewhat
at
a
loss
i
remember
see
henry
and
clare
booth
luce
come
into
a
restaurant
in
philadelphia
and
think
how
important
they
look
and
indeed
they
be
i
be
very
excite
to
be
there
but
felt
very
new
and
small
in
the
truman
dewey
election
the
post
maintain
its
tradition
begin
under
my
father
s
independent
ownership
of
not
endorse
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
rather
the
paper
comment
editorially
on
both
major
candidate
we
criticize
dewey
s
statement
indicate
that
he
would
turn
over
a
large
measure
of
control
of
atomic
energy
to
private
industry
and
praise
his
statement
about
the
berlin
blockade
we
criticize
truman
for
suggest
that
dewey
be
a
totalitarian
and
agree
with
a
great
deal
of
his
denunciation
of
the
congress
the
last
gallup
poll
publish
before
the
election
give
dewey
a
five
percentage
point
lead
over
truman
when
it
become
clear
that
truman
have
indeed
fool
the
pundit
and
pull
off
a
political
miracle
phil
have
spent
much
of
the
night
at
the
office
sent
off
a

your

of

campaign
be
fair
and
comprehensive
what
be
most
important
for
us
personally
about
the
election
be
the
terrible
trouble
in
which
our
great
friend
prich
found
himself
in
the
kentucky
senate
race
that
year
between
the
democrat
virgil
chapman
for
whom
prich
didn
t
even
particularly
care
and
the
liberal
republican
john
sherman
cooper
whom
he
like
he
do
an
incredibly
wrong
and
foolish
thing
that
ruin
his
life
someone
come
to
him
and
ask
him
to
sign
some
ballot
with
fake
name
and
prich
do
in
april
of
prich

his
law
partner
al
funk
be
indict
under
the

the

of
the

cast
for
the
republican
candidate
for

senator
and
congressman
in
kentucky
in
the
general

the
previous

but
though
funk
be
ultimately
absolve
prich
be
sentence
to
prison
for
two
year
phil
and
other
friend
of
prich
s
try
to
help
as
best
they
could
they
collect
and
sent
money
which
be
always
in
short
supply
with
prich
but
particularly
so
as
his
lawyer
prepared
appeal
and
his
own
source
of
income
his
law
practice
cease
to
exist
but
the
appeal
on
which
joe
rauh
and
others
have
work
tirelessly
fail
when
the
first
judgment
be
affirm
by
the
united
state
circuit
court
the
case
be
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
which
affirm
the

decision
for

clemency
ask
for
a
pardon
or
commutation
of

but
he
go
off
to
prison
and
serve
five
month
of
his
sentence
before
be
pardon
just
before
christmas
of
by
president
truman
largely
at
the
behest
ironically
of
the
very
decent
senator
cooper
who
have
won
the
race
against
chapman
for
whom
prich
have
stuffed
the
ballot
our
heart
be
broken
for
our
friend
we
be
dumbfound
here
be
the
man
among
us
most
destine
for
greatness
yet
now
he
d
be
found
guilty
of
so
stupid
and
irresponsible
an
act
and
be
off
to
prison
it
be
hard
to
understand
how
such
a
distinguish
mind
could
have
do
such
a
shock
thing
as
prich
told
a
reporter
in
i
get
to
feel
perhaps
that
i
be
big
than
i
be
that
the
rule
didn
t
apply
to
me
my
own
inclination
be
to
believe
that
flaw
as
he
be
in
character
prich
let
his
desire
to
be
one
of
the
boy
overcome
his
intelligence
and
his
judgment
he
have
perhaps
be
too
successful
at
too
young
an
age
and
have
live
a
pattern
of
permissiveness
and
laxity
which
have
always
be
the
despair
of
his
many
friend
even
after
he
get
out
of
jail
and
begin
to
make
a
scratchy
living
he
occasionally
neglect
to
finish
work
that
have
be
contrive
especially
for
him
some
of
his
old
habit
of
not
always
fulfil
his
part
of
any
bargain
endure
yet
still
we
love
him
somehow
one
couldn
t
help
it
he
write
phil
from
prison
that
while
i
have
many
moment
of
bitter
self
reproach
i
cannot
afford
the
excess
baggage
of
feel
sorry
for
myself
or
plot
revenge
against
those
who
may
have
treat
me
badly
though
i
hate
them
plenty
he
found
the
prison
to
which
he
be
assign
to
be
as
good
as
one
could
hope
for
mild
in
its
discipline
and
a
comfortable
enough
stop
place
in
the
end
he
regain
his
influence
in
kentucky
as
head
of
an
education
commission
appoint
by
governor
ned
breathitt
which
succeed
in
implement
important
education
reform
he
regain
his
life
and
die
in
the
heroic
figure
we
have
envision
endure
his
many
affliction
with
great
courage
and
continue
to
function
despite
be
diabetic
and
become
blind
from
the
turn
of
the
new
decade
politics
seem
to
heat
up
on
february
senator
joseph
mccarthy
launch
his
campaign
against
a
so
call
communist
conspiracy
to
subvert
american
life
phil
s
first
response
be
to
dismiss
mccarthy
s
tirade
and
the
senator
himself
a
few
month
after
the
begin
of
mccarthy
s
invective
phil
say
of
the
senator
mccarthy
be
cause
a
lot
of
noise
here
and
do
a
lot
of
harm
but
i
be
hopeful
that
he
will
eventually
end
up
on
his
backside
phil
have
to
tread
a
fine
line
in
this
very
difficult
time
he
have
be
an
ardent
liberal
but
in
this
period
when
he
be
fight
for
the
life
of
the
paper
he
be
clearly
become
more
conservative
and
more
anticommunist
mostly
no
doubt
in
response
to
event
in
the
real
world
but
also
to
some
extent
in
response
to
the
constant
attack
on
the
paper
and
on
him
personally
outsider
didn
t
realize
that
phil
have
many
problem
with
the
internal
politics
of
the
post
during
this
period
some
of
which
stem
from
the
increasingly
differ
political
view
of
phil
on
the
one
hand
and
alan
barth
and
herblock
on
the
other
for
example
a
real
brick
fell
on
phil
s
head
one
day
in
the
spring
of
he
and
i
be
return
together
from
new
york
by
train
and
he
be
go
through
the
post
suddenly
reading
an
editorial
he
knew
to
be
write
by
barth
phil
go
ballistic
in
this
editorial
barth
have
commend
earl
browder
the
former
secretary
general
of
the
communist
party
in
america
and
the
communist
candidate
for
the
presidency
in
and
for
defy
a
special
subcommittee
of
the
senate
foreign
relation
committee
that
be
try
to
compel
him
to
disclose
the
name
of
his
former
associate
conspire
against
the
united
state
barth
be
a
brilliant
and
brave
defender
of
civil
liberty
and
constitutional
right
but
in
his
appropriate
concern
for
the
right
of
privacy
he
tend
to
minimize
the
real
danger
of
communism
all
the
paper
s
top
editor
and
manager
be
alarmed
at
the
stick
we
have
hand
our
enemy
with
which
to
beat
us
and
of
course
beat
us
they
do
the
time
herald
dubbed
us
browder
s
organ
phil
be
so
deeply
upset
that
he
want
to
fire
alan
immediately
luckily
during
one
of
our
sunday
morning
visit
to
frankfurter
felix
quietly
but
firmly
persuade
him
not
to
but
several
day
after
the
editorial
appear
a
note
be
print
in
the
paper
regret
it
the
tension
between
phil
and
barth
remain
several
month
later
phil
write
to
my
father
that
he
have
be
change
or
kill
a
lot
more
editorial
than
usual
almost
entirely
barth
s
production
and
he
be
worried
that
elliston
would
think
they
be
have
difference
phil
met
with
elliston
outside
of
the
office
to
review
the
general
situation
and
philosophy
of
the
editorial
page
explain
that
he
be
extremely
concerned
about
barth
as
he
write
to
my
father
and
as
he
told
elliston
he
do
not
want
to
slip
into
be
a
namby
pamby
paper
like
the
n
y
time
but
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
want
to
throw
away
the
prestige
and
the
power
of
the
paper
by
get
in
trouble
on
minor
front
through
sloppy
work
eventually
however
phil
calm
down
and
live
with
alan
barth
who
go
on
to
be
a
great
adornment
to
the
page
and
to
the
post
joe
rauh
later
say
of
the
terrible
strain
between
alan
and
phil
i
think
phil
be
really
quite
frighten
in
the
mccarthy
period
when
the
post
be
lose
advertiser
by
the
possibility
that
he
an
outsider
might
lose
the
paper
i
think
he
didn
t
really
analyze
some
of
the
problem
with
alan
like
whether
alan
be
right
or
wrong
phil
felt
a
responsibility
for
the
post
over
and
beyond
the
normal
responsibility
of
life
because
it
wasn
t
his
i
think
he
have
be
give
this
thing
and
he
damn
well
be
not
go
to
let
it
go
he
be
not
go
to
let
it
die
i
m
not
sure
exactly
when
phil
begin
to
think
in
term
of
eisenhower
as
a
possible
presidential
candidate
or
even
whether
he
come
to
this
himself
or
be
influence
by
someone
possibly
my
father
in
one
letter
to
prich
who
prefer
dewey
to
eisenhower
but
be
convince
the
republican
would
win
in
no
matter
who
the
candidate
be
phil
urge
him
not
to
be
too
anti
ike
admit
that
he
himself
have
be
until
eisenhower
s
last
visit
to
washington
when
phil
met
him
at
a
small
private
lunch
for
newspaperman
and
begin
to
change
his
mind
by
the
summer
of

disgust
at
the
idea
of
more
leadership
on
either
the
truman

taft
level
that
he
join
my
father
in

strong

convince
that
eisenhower
have
the
one
thing
that
we
have
be
look
for
in
recent
year
it
be
generally
described
as
character
although
independence
be
the
watchword
at
the
paper
the
editorial
line
clearly
begin
to
back
eisenhower
and
on
march
the

him
over

most
effective
journalistic
blow
that
have
be
struck
for
ike
the
endorsement
cause

everywhere
not

within
our
family
my
father
s
health
and
strength
have
begin
to
fail
and
he
be
feel
out
of
the
loop
and
insufficiently
consult
despite
phil
s
best
effort
to
keep
him
involve
in
the
paper
and
the
company
apparently
in
the
case
of
the
endorsement
phil
have
neglect
to
bring
my
father
who
be
in
florida
at
the
time
into
the
decision

in
on
the

very
day
the

up
with
a
private
anguish
letter
to
phil

she
be
worn
out
try
to
keep
my
father
on
an
even
keel
and
chastise
phil
for
not
have
include
him
there
be
no
record
of
phil
s
response
but
clearly
he
must
have
take
her
word
to
heart
follow
this
letter
he
write
dad
several
time
in
great
detail
about
various
issue
involve
the
paper
consult
him
on
different
matter
from
a
proposal
to
revise
the
format
of
the
editorial
page
and
the
woman
s
section
to
the
idea
of
a
rotogravure
section
for
the
sunday
paper
i
be
concerned
about
my
father
s
hurt
feeling
but
i
confess
that
i
identify
completely
with
phil
and
with
the
pressure
under
which
he
operate
even
though
i
differ
with
him
about
backing
eisenhower
phil
and
i
go
to
the
convention
that
summer
both
of
which
take
place
in
chicago
eisenhower
be
nominate
and
phil
be
of
course
happy
with
the
victory
i
see
now
that
we
all
regard
taft
as
too
much
of
a
right
winger
and
an
isolationist
the
latter
he
be
but
his
political
view
be
really
moderate
farsighted
and
decent
our
fear
at
the
time
be
very
real
however
and
seem
very
valid
i
be
slightly
more
skeptical
than
phil
about
eisenhower
i
suppose
somewhere
deep
inside
phil
be
seek
recognition
as
an
independent
in
contrast
to
his
liberal
history
my
own
political
view
never
change
much
and
usually
make
me
support
the
democratic
candidate
although
i
be
and
be
a
centrist
when
in
the
candidate
turn
out
to
be
adlai
stevenson
i
have
no
doubt
where
my
allegiance
lay
like
many
people
of
my
general
persuasion
i
be
swept
away
with
excitement
by
stevenson
i
well
remember
the
impact
of
first
see
him
at
the
convention
i
thought
he
be
marvelously
charismatic
and
be
immediately
enthusiastic
about
him
his
acceptance
speech
make
in
the
late
hour
of
the
night
and
with
its
rather
pretentious
biblical
quotation
about
the
cup
passing
from
his
lip
be
electrify
the
post
editorialize
that
for
stevenson
the
office
chose
the
man
phil
of
course
knew
how
i
felt
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
at
the
end
of
the
summer
he
write
i
confess
that
my
wife
since
see
adlai
the
adorable
have
show
sign
of
be
a
crypto
democrat
despite
my
excitement
about
stevenson
however
i
be
under
no
illusion
about
the
possibility
of
his
win
adlai
s
ambivalence
about
the
presidency
both
want
it
and
not
want
it
be
his
achilles
heel
for
a
politician
to
equivocate
about
his
desire
regard
the
presidency
disqualifies
him
i
later
realize
but
in
the
summer
of
like
so
many
of
us
i
be
overwhelmed
by
this
extraordinarily
articulate
witty
man
phil
on
the
other
hand
be
fervently
embrace
eisenhower
and
the
republican
that
summer
he
get
to
know
richard
nixon
who
have
be
take
on
as
ike
s
vice
presidential
candidate
phil
be
impressed
with
him
and
thought
he
would
be
a
big
help
in
the
campaign
nixon
have
lunch
in
midsummer
with
phil
rus
wiggins
and
my
father
and
phil
report
to
a
newspaper
friend
that
the
three
of
us
all
felt
that
he
be
obviously
a
person
of
major
talent
whereas
i
and
most
of
my
friend
be
deeply
concerned
about
his
red
baiting
victorious
early
campaign
against
helen
gahagan
douglas
and
about
his
pronounce
right
wing
proclivity
and
seem
sympathy
for
mccarthy
throughout
this
campaign
phil
be
constantly
have
to
defend
both
the
post
s
endorsement
in
the
primary
of
ike
over
taft
and
his
own
surprising
political
view
to
those
who
chide
him
about
his
strange
bedfellow
his
comeback
be
to
suggest
they
might
shake
up
their
own
sheet
and
take
a
look
under
the
cover
yet
even
though
the
paper
be
support
eisenhower
phil
try
as
he
say
as
carefully
as
be
humanly
possible
not
to
be
prejudice
or
blind
to
the
quality
of
stevenson
or
some
of
the
weakness
of
the
republican
among
the
weakness
of
the
republican
be
the
failure
of
eisenhower
to
speak
out
against
mccarthy
and
the
excess
of
the
right
wing
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
the
last
straw
be
add
against
eisenhower
in
the
now
well
know
incident
involve
general
george
c
marshall
whom
mccarthy
have
be
viciously
attack
ike
s
decent
instinct
come
to
the
fore
and
he
have
apparently
decide
to
defend
the
general
in
a
speech
on
one
of
his
campaign

through
wisconsin

s
political
counselor
to
dissuade
him
from
make
the
favorable
and
supportive
comment
ike
still
relatively
new
to
politics
give
in
to
his
adviser
and
eliminate
the
paragraph
but
do
this
so
late
that
the
whole
affair
become
public
i
have
remain
open
mind
until
then
but
now
i
be
solidly
for
stevenson
although
phil
too
be
shock
at
ike
s
lack
of
strength
in
stand
up
to
mccarthy
my
view
didn
t
worry
or
influence
him
nor
his
me
our
political
difference
didn
t
come
between
us
personally
we
each
understood
where
the
other
one
be
phil
s
direction
of
the
post
during
the
campaign
stir
up
some
resistance
and
problem
from
within
the
rank
of
the
staff
at
some
point
several
staffer
want
to
run
an
ad
in
the
paper
declare
themselves
for
stevenson
but
phil
apparently
talk
them
out
of
it
most
important
he
and
herblock
have
quite
a
struggle
herb
s
cartoon
have
always
be
sear
and
powerful
he
have
first
drawn
nixon
in
a
cartoon
on
may
in
which
nixon
and
two
others
all
dress
as
puritan
be
picture
building
a
fire
under
a
chain
statue
of
liberty
and
say
we
ve
get
to
burn
the
evil
spirit
out
of
her
as
the
campaign
heat
up
and
eisenhower
wasn
t
speak
out
against
mccarthy
herblock
drew
cartoon
that
be
clearly
at
odds
with
the
editorial
support
the
post
be
give
ike
phil
be
incense
by
many
of
these
cartoon
one
that
he
refuse
to
print
depict
eisenhower
say
naughty
naughty
to
nixon
and
mccarthy
who
be
drawn
as
two
smear
artist
with
bucket
and
drip
brush
in
their
hand
finally
during
the
last
week
of
the
campaign
phil
have
the
cartoon
drop
from
the
paper
altogether
the
last
time
i
believe
this
ever
happen
instead
he
use
reprint
of
earlier
cartoon
since
the
cartoon
ran
elsewhere
in
syndication
this
ploy
be
not
only
ineffective
but
embarrass
in
late
october
the
washington
daily
news
carry
an
article
headline
where
s
mr
block
one
of
d
c
s
top
drawer
be
miss
on
the
other
hand
it
s
easy
to
see
why
phil
felt
he
have
to
take
action
it
s
hard
for
a
publisher
try
to
espouse
a
certain
cause
in
the
paper
to
have
such
powerful
cartoon
run
on
the
same
page
and
dominate
print
even
so
phil
later
acknowledge
to
herblock
that
he
have
be
mistaken
phil
become
more
and
more
actively
involve
in
the
election
itself
so
much
so
that
he
actually
campaign
for
eisenhower
a
few
time
on
october
he
serve
as
master
of
ceremony
for
a
citizen
for
eisenhower
rally
to
keep
phil
company
i
go
with
him
to
at
least
one
eisenhower
rally
include
one
where
phil
spoke
but
i
sat
silently
i
can
t
justify
phil
s
action
but
publisher
do
this
kind
of
thing
more
often
then
for
instance
john
and
mike
cowles
publisher
in
de
moines
and
minneapolis
be
big
contributor
to
as
well
as
activist
in
ike
s
campaign
on
election
day
november
we
watch
the
return
at
the
rauhs
ironically
probably
our
most
liberal
friend
phil
be
thrill
by
the
result
however
he
write
stevenson
a
few
day
after
the
election
if
you
ll
permit
an
expression
from
a
black
soul
of
the
one
party
press
i
would
like
to
say
that
yours
be
a
campaign
you
and
your
son
can
be
proud
of
in
any
event
even
in
opposition
i
be
proud
of
you
from
your
first
remark
on
astor
street
to
your
closing
comment
in
springfield
my
wife
over
whom
you
have
control
superior
to
mine
join
me
in
wish
you
a
an
immediate
rest
and
b
a
fruitful
future
by
now
mccarthy
be
grow
even
more
sinister
and
more
powerful
play
on
fear
stem
from
the
cold
war
he
make
outrageous
charge
many
within
the
protect
confines
of
senate
or
congressional
hearing
or
just
before
newspaper
and
television
deadline
so
that
all
that
get
on
the
front
page
or
the
air
be
the
charge
itself
after
a
while
we
in
the
medium
learn
to
carry
the
other
side
and
to
put
his
charge
in
perspective
but
he
be
a
new
phenomenon
with
which
the
press
have
to
learn
to
cope
and
it
take
a
while
to
catch
up
with
his
method
much
of
phil
s
time
be
take
up
with
the
mccarthy
menace
the
fear
of
communism
remain
pervasive
and
attack
on
people
for
be
sympathizer
or
liberal
even
much
less
genuine
communist
continued
to
stir
up
serious
trouble
editorially
the
post
be
highly
critical
of
mccarthy
s
position
and
attack
him
regularly
most
effective
of
all
probably
be
herblock
s
series
of
cartoon
depict
mccarthy
and
his
various
outrageous
activity
it
be
herblock
who
have
coin
the
word
mccarthyism
on
march
use
it
as
a
label
on
a
tar
barrel
take
together
the
post
s
comment
against
mccarthy
represent
a
very
clear
and
brave
position
and
the
paper
take
a
lot
of
heat
for
its
coverage
in
fact
the
war
between
mccarthy
and
the
post
be
vicious
and
frighten
we
be
help
to
a
certain
extent
by
joe
alsop
and
his
brother
stewart
whose
column
have
become
important
to
the
post
and
whose
anticommunist
theme
help
soften
the
perception
of
the
post
as
somehow
sympathetic
to
the
communist
perhaps
too
some
of
the
criticism
be
blunt
because
of
the
paper
s
support
of
eisenhower
this
be
offset
however
by
criticism
from
the
left
that
we
be
not
do
enough
about
mccarthy
once
eisenhower
be
president
he
become
one
of
those
who
phil
felt
be
not
speak
out
enough
and
he
become
more
and
more
disenchant
with
the
president
s
lack
of
response
to
mccarthy
and
the
climate
he
be
nourish
walter
lippmann
have
be
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of
eisenhower
but
his
wife
helen
like
me
have
be
a
renegade
for
stevenson
sometime
soon
after
the
election
the
four
of
us
be
together
and
walter
ask
phil
what
be
we
go
to
do
at
the
same
time
he
turn
to
helen
and
me
say
and
you
shut
up
we
laugh
at
the
two
men
s
dismay
over
white
house
passivity
phil
be
constantly
badgering
sherman
adam
the
president
s
chief
aide
to
try
to
get
eisenhower
to
take
strong
stand
since
the
post
be
still
fight
for
its
life
economically
phil
felt
very
pressure
by
force
he
couldn
t
control
one
of
the
principal
force
over
which
he
have
little
control
at
this
time
be
my
mother
like
barth
and
herblock
she
be
unrelenting
in
her
condemnation
of
mccarthy
and
his
reckless
charge
she
despise
him
vigorously
and
publicly
call
him
variously
a
perpetual
adolescent
who
have
never
mature
a
warp
personality
who
be
now
revenge
himself
upon
a
society
which
he
feel
have
never
be
fair
to
him
and
a
gangster
type
in
worry
that
insinuation
and
accusation
by
anticommunists
be
go
to
get
people
thrown
out
of
their
job
without
hope
of
reinstatement
she
felt
that
such
behavior
put
america
on
the
road
to
something
bad
than
a
gestapo
her
answer
be
to
look
to
the
post
to
handle
the
situation
and
to
pressure
phil
to
try
to
save
our
democratic
freedom
she
argue
not
illogically
what
be
the
use
fight
totalitarianism
abroad
if
we
be
go
to
imitate
its
bad
aspect
here
at
home
but
as
usual
her
passion
be
excessive
and
uncontrolled
shortly
after
the
inauguration
my
mother
deliver
her
strong
blast
yet
against

not
only
academic
freedom
but
american
democracy
itself
in
this
speech
she
call
mccarthy
our
modern
grand
inquisitor
a
dangerous
and
ruthless
demagogue
a
political
adventurer
and
a
psychopath
and
compare
his
tactic
to
those
of

not
before
the
time

with
take
on

often
take
on
the
catholic

for
its
stand
on

she
view
this
as
a
just
cause
and
herself
as
an
intrepid
warrior
for
public
education
but
it
be
phil
and
the
post
who
paid
the
price
in
counterattack
of
a
serious
kind
such
as
a
boycott
a
burden
which
phil
view
with
some
outrage
as
an
unnecessary
one
in
the
circulation
and
advertising
struggle
just
as
he
occasionally
pull
back

and

so
too
he
have
to
rein
in
my
mother
now
and
then
one
notable
time
come
in
when
he
disown
a
speech
she
make
in
detroit
condemn
attempt
by
the
catholic
hierarchy
to

he
felt
the

would
be
construe
as
anti
catholic
mother
have
warn
phil
that
she
would
be
make
this
speech
i
hope
it
make
no
difficulty
for
the

i
have
write
to

so
that
he

within
the

it
can
end
only
in
the

catastrophe
of
a
catholic
political
party
no
human
be
can
blindly
accept

we
must
close
the
door
tight
against

of
the
catholic
hierarchy
and
reactionary
protestant
to
force
our

whose
rapid
increase
would
destroy

so
alarmed
that

that
my

of

advice
however
he
soften
it
to
a
statement
to
be
read
as
come
from
her
which
he
hop
would
be
picked
up
by
the

detroit
speech
be
my
own
and
do
not
reflect
the
opinion
of
the
washington
post
i
do
not
participate
in
the
formation
of
editorial
policy
the
question
then
arose
as
to
how
to
reach
her
since
she
be
on
a
night
train
return
home
rus
knew
the

at

at

in
the
morning
wake

get
her
to
sign
off
on

long
feisty
exchange
of

between

and
phil
all

out
by

typically
she
depict
her
situation
as
unbearable
and
ask
rhetorically
what
she
be
to
do
i
can
t
live
in
hell
at
home
i
can
t
worry
butch
unnecessarily
i
mustn
t
hurt
the
stockholder
of
the
post
butch
s
major
fear
but
i
might
as
well
stop
all
my
effort
to
create
community
solidarity
to
strengthen
the
public
school
and
to
defend
my
country
against
a
foe
no
less
dangerous
than
the
communist
if
i
have
to
shut
up
about
catholic
political
ambition
she
end
her
letter
by
tell
phil
not
to
bother
to
reply
but
suggest
they
must
get
together
for
a
good
talk
he
sent
back
a
fourteen
page

rightly
or
wrongly
he
didn
t
agree
with
her
analysis
of
the
urgency
of
the
problem
you
see
arise
from
the
american
catholic

could
find
out
whether
my
position
result
from
fear
or
objectivity
but
i
at
least
be
unaware
of
the
fear
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
her
speech
would
cause
considerable
hostility
to
the
post
he
believe
there
have
to
be
a
sense
of
priority
about
the
number
of
war
the
post
be
willing
to
engage
in
and
saw
his
obligation
as
define
the
priority
with
an
overall
institutional
point
of
view
so
the
question
for
him
be
why
the
post
should
carry
another
burden
when
it
be
not
one
our
institutional
think
make
necessary
even
though
he
felt
his
most
odious
bias
be
toward
be
pollyanna
phil
conclude
that
time
and
tolerance
and
thoughtful
discussion
have
work
out
many
a
tough
problem
add
if
we
could
simply
agree
to
disagree
it
would
be
easy
but
we
re
hooked
which
make
it
both
more
complicate
and
more
fun
for
the
fact
be
that
you
cannot
be
only
an
individual
apart
from
the
post
any
more
than
em
can
or
kay
elliston
wiggins
graham
et
al
we
ll
have
to
compensate
our
occasional
partial
loss
of
individuality
by
recognize
the
merit
of
the
overall
institution
so
the
potentially
sear
episode
be
gradually
put
behind
all
of
us
when
this
kind
of
drama
arose
i
experienced
no
emotional
complication
i
be
percent
behind
phil
and
in
accord
with
his
view
about
the
family
tension
as
indeed
most
of
the
time
be
my
father
many
emotion
flare
up
in
this
period
of
mccarthy
s
heyday
friend
fell
out
with
each
other
row
erupt
on
every
side
one
notable
argument
close
to
home
take
place
in
march
at
a
lunch
at
joe
alsop
s
although
the
detail
be
lose
to
me
now
i
recall
that
it
be
a
small
luncheon
party
with
friend
include
isaiah
berlin
who
be
here
from
england
whatever
the
specific
of
the
argument
at
some
point
phil
explode
with
anger
and
he
and
isaiah
fought
loud
and
long
i
believe
phil
eventually
storm
out
of
joe
s
house
joe
be
furious
with
phil
and
wouldn
t
speak
to
him
isaiah
thought
phil
have
be
incredibly
rude
and
call
to
tell
him
so
phil
write
isaiah
that
the
boorishness
at
lunch
be
inexplicable
and
inexcusable
plain
bad
manner
he
add
in
his
own
way
of
apologize
i
only
hope
that
by
now
you
may
believe
it
have
nothing
more
to
it
than
that
i
be
an
occasional
sufferer
from
a
tendency
to
get
one
s
mouth
in
high
gear
before
one
s
brain
turn
over
phil
and
joe
make
up
as
well
but
their
relationship
be
not
without
far
argument
and
letter
fly
back
and
forth
in
mid
for
example
they
get
into
another
terrible
fight
at
joe
s
house
over
the
issue
of
take
the
fifth
amendment
rather
than
testify
that
time
joe
follow
up
with
a
letter
of
apology
and
explanation
i
have
search
my
memory
of
our
conversation
to
uncover
what
might
have
offend
you
as
so
obviously
you
be
deeply
offend
as
nearly
as
i
can
disentangle
our
discussion
you
may
perhaps
have
thought
i
be
tease
you
because
you
be
now
a
successful
man
well
in
a
minor
way
i
suppose
i
be
too
joe
s
reference
to
phil
s
be
a
successful
man
and
thus
forget
what
it
be
like
to
be
poor
obviously
touch
a
more
sensitive
nerve
than
any
of
us
understood
at
the
time
it
come
out
later
when
he
be
ill
that
phil
resent
the
way
he
have
be
help
to
his
successful
forum
but
his
ability
be
clearly
so
extraordinary
that
none
of
us
suspect
the
insecurity
that
lay
beneath
the
surface
one
great
loss
for
us
and
for
the
post
be
that
herbert
elliston
s
heart
disease
force
him
to
resign
in
as
editor
of
the
editorial
page
in
a
farewell
interview
in
the
paper
herbert
say
he
have
no
guide
principle
to
leave
but
if
he
do
it
would
be
a
line
from
somerset
maugham
if
a
nation
value
anything
more
than
freedom
it
will
lose
its
freedom
and
the
irony
of
it
be
that
if
it
be
comfort
or
money
that
it
value
more
it
will
lose
that
too
herbert
have
be
the
editor
for
thirteen
very
distinguish
year
phil
immediately
go
after
our
friend
scotty
reston
to
be
herbert
s
successor
phil
s
offer
to
scotty
sent
the
new
york
time
into
action
to
keep
him
there
the
result
be
that
arthur
krock
move
out
of
the
way
to
allow
the
time
to
make
scotty
its
washington
bureau
chief
from
scotty
s
point
of
view
that
wasn
t
even
necessary
his
response
to
phil
be
simply
to
say
i
can
t
leave
the
time
at
that
point
phil
surprisingly
turn
to
the
young
member
of
the
editorial
staff
thirty
four
year
old
robert
estabrook
to
run
the
editorial
page
at
about
the
same
time
he
cajole
al
friendly
whom
he
consider
one
of
the
paper
s
top
reporter
to
be
assistant
manage
editor
for
the
daytime
this
provide
rus
wiggins
with
the
first
real
backup
he
have
ever
have
for
a
distinguish
reporter
to
become
an
editor
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
transition
both
for
the
person
and
for
management
the
two
job
require
different
skill
and
naturally
some
reporter
make
the
transition
and
become
able
editor
and
some
don
t
there
be
no
good
way
to
know
except
to
try
for
too
long
the
post
be
not
very
good
at
help
people
to
learn
to
be
manager
but
though
al
miss
reporting
he
take
up
the
challenge
of
management
with
enthusiasm

the
pattern
of
our
life
be
change
as
the
busyness
increase
i
try
to
find
way
to
give
phil
some
relief
because
both
he
and
i
have
have
strong
negative
reaction
to
the
summer
of
when
we
try
to
take
the
child
away
to
new
england
phil
to
the
commute
and
i
to
the
life
of
woman
and
child
all
week
without
their
men
we
decide
to
look
for
a
summer
retreat
closer
to
home
i
have
conclude
i
d
take
any
house
no
more
than
twenty
minute
away
from
washington
and
in
the
summer
of
we
rent
a
house
in
warrenton
virginia
a
bit
farther
out
but
still
acceptable
to
me
phil
like
it
so
much
that
we
rent
another
house
in
the
fall
to
continue
country
life
on
weekend
i
would
probably
never
have
do
any
of
this
have
phil
not
insist
he
love
the
country
and
the
child
thrive
on
it
i
be
less
enthusiastic
have
never
live
this
way
it
meant
a
lot
of
work
for
me
every
weekend
to
pack
up
the
child
the
household
the
food
and
later
the
dog
but
phil
pronounce
it
all
such
a
success
that
we
start
to
drive
around
the
countryside
look
for
a
place
of
our
own
our
dream
be
a
house
about
an
hour
from
washington
with
a
few
acre
around
it
to
protect
us
just
before
christmas
phil
remark
that
he
didn
t
think
i
really
want
to
find
a
place
and
ask
whether
there
wasn
t
anything
i
d
see
that
i
like
i
have
indeed
like
one
place
in
marshall
virginia
but
have
thought
it
be
too
big
and
too
expensive
in
addition
it
be
a
work
farm
which
i
didn
t
want
to
take
on
and
run
as
i
set
out
again
on
the
search
after
new
year
s
the
agent
told
me
that
the
place
be
still
for
sale
they
d
come
down
in
their
price
and
the
farm
part
be
rent
out
so
the
farm
be
take
care
of
we
go
back
to
look
at
it
again
and
as
happen
with
our
house
in
washington
we
fell
in
love
with
it
the
house
and
the
land
glen
welby
as
the
house
be
call
be
locate
in
a
seclude
area
halfway
between
warrenton
and
middleburg
virginia
about
an
hour
and
twenty
minute
from
washington
the
house
be
set
in
the
middle
of
acre
about
sixty
of
which
be
wood
we
bought
glen
welby
for
a
sum
that
be
ridiculously
small
when
look
at
today
but
which
seem
a
really
large
undertaking
for
us
then
particularly
since
the
house
need
a
lot
of
restoration
and
repair
and
of
course
i
have
to
furnish
it
completely
the
house
be
a
real
family
house
large
and
sprawl
the
center
part
probably
date
to
the
early
s
and
the
back
room
have
be
add
by
the
time
of
the
civil
war
a
kitchen
wing
follow
and
a
large
living
room
and
master
bedroom
and
porch
have
be
add
by
the
former
owner
in
just
before
the
crash
it
be
typical
of
our
marital
relationship
that
phil
conceive
the
idea
of
a
country
house
for
summer
and
weekend
and
i
do
the
actual
work
our
relationship
resemble
that
of
a
chief
executive
officer
phil
and
a
chief
operating
officer
me
he
have
the
idea
and
spark
i
carry
them
out
and
ran
thing
despite
the
extra
work
for
me
i
m
grateful
to
phil
for
this
idea
of
buying
the
farm
it
s
now
a
familiar
phenomenon
for
those
who
can
afford
weekend
country
life
on
a
great
or
lesser
scale
but
then
it
be
much
less
common
my
son
donald
and
his
wife
mary
now
own
glen
welby
and
spend
time
there
with
their
child
in
much
the
same
way
we
do
on
the
social
front
we
be
get
to
know
an
ever
wider
number
of
people
i
lunch
with
a
variety
of
woman
many
of
whom
be
close
friend
at
one
point
phil
notice
that
there
be
always
a
three
way
morning
conversation
among
polly
wisner
evangeline
bruce
and
me
he
dubbed
this
the
nine
o
clock
network
and
say
he
be
go
to
buy
time
on
it
yet
despite
have
a
circle
of
friend
i
be
still
maladroit
at
manage
our
social
life
because
phil
be
consume
with
work
he
be
strict
with
me
about
how
many
invitation
to
accept
for
the
evening
at
first
i
rather
stupidly
told
people
i
would
consult
phil
about
whether
we
could
accept
he
insist
that
i
just
tell
them
no
point
out
how
hopelessly
awkward
it
appear
if
i
hesitate
or
say
i
d
ask
him
i
remember
once
say
shouldn
t
we
go
i
ve
say
no
to
the
french
embassy
five
time
already
to
which
he
quickly
respond
what
s
wrong
with
a
sixth
one
day
he
come
home
to
glen
welby
with
an
invitation
from
the
head
of
the
joint
chief
of
staff
to
go
out
on
the
sequoia
then
the
official
government
entertainment
boat
which
he
say
he
d
regret
why
i
ask
it
sound
like
fun
his
response
it
sound
like
fun
but
think
who
s
go
to
be
there
whereas
phil
be
disincline
to
accept
invitation
once
he
get
wherever
we
be
go
he
usually
enjoy
it
hugely
and
be
reluctant
to
come
home
i
on
the
other
hand
initially
would
want
to
go
much
more
than
he
do
but
often
felt
uncomfortable
or
shy
once
we
get
there
one
example
during
these
year
be
the
dance
class
an
old
washington
tradition
that
have
be
start
by
mr
joseph
leiter
s
mother
know
as
ma
williams
the
dance
class
be
the
ultimate
snobbish
social
event
and
rule
for
entry
be
excessively
rigid
politician
be
not
among
those
invite
to
attend
truman
s
vice
president
alben
barkley
and
his
young
wife
jane
be
turn
down
for
example
someone
once
want
to
invite
richard
aldrich
the
producer
but
this
request
be
turn
down
because
it
be
fear
he
might
want
to
bring
his
beautiful
actress
wife
gertrude
lawrence
who
be
in
town
with
the
king
and
i
i
confess
i
want
to
be
include
janet
barnes
our
close
friend
who
have
grown
up
with
all
those
people
propose
us
to
the
committee
and
we
be
accepted
i
suppose
i
may
have
want
to
be
accepted
because
of
my
childhood
and
because
i
knew
that
my
parent
have
not
be
member
i
suppose
i
may
also
have
like
the
idea
of
the
class
because
the
rest
of
my
life
during
those
year
seem
so
unglamorous
house
child
board
and
good
work
phil
could
not
have
care
less
but
typically
rather
enjoy
the
whole
thing
once
we
go
whereas
i
be
usually
overcome
by
an
outbreak
of
nerve
and
the
old
fear
of
get
stuck
with
a
partner
on
the
dance
floor
i
remember
phil
tell
me
with
some
impatience
that
it
be
up
to
me
to
take
care
of
myself
that
if
i
get
stuck
with
someone
i
should
just
say
goodbye
walk
away
and
find
someone
else
it
didn
t
do
to
be
passive
and
feel
sorry
for
myself
our
public

kept
me
busier
than
ever
accompany

i
kept
less
careful

yet
although
it
may
have

and
against
phil

very
unwilling
to
take
any
trouble
with

for
the

world
and
say
that
thing

much
too

odd
way
to
this

a
neurotic
concern
that
a

learn
from

steichen
paid
a
touch
tribute
to
the
whole

it
be
all
a
great
success
because
both
my
parent
love
occasion
and
celebrate
them
to
the
utmost
we
always
seem
to
be
have
these

anniversary
or
anniversary
of
the
post

of
my

s
acquisition
of
it
sometimes
we
would
return
from
halfway
around
the
world
for
these
event
there
be
always
considerable
pressure
to
arrange
them
to
say
nothing
of
attend
them
ritual
in
one
s
life
often
start
accidentally
and
then
perpetuate
themselves
as
a
pattern
we
developed
several
happy
ritual
in
those
year
because
phil
saw
so
little
of
the
child
we
begin
to
take
vacation
with
them
an
early
one
in
st
petersburg
florida

my
introduction
to
baseball
since
the
yankee
train
there
and
we
watch
the
exhibition
game
after
that
and
because
of
don
s
passion
for
the
game
i
learn
to
enjoy
baseball
and
even
keep
score
because
this
be
something
both
phil
and
don
like
to
do
after
we
bought
the
television
station
in
jacksonville

a
beautiful
beach

an
hour

several
year
in
a
row
we
spent
ten
day
there
right
after
school
let
out
for
the
summer
directly
on
our
return
from

we
would
give
a
party
at
glen
welby

post

celebrate
the
anniversary
of
the
purchase
of
the
paper
it
start
with
the
twentieth
anniversary
but
become
an
annual
event
and
a
large
burden
on
me
at
the
time
since
i
still
hadn
t
learn
how
to
organize
people
to
get
the
work
do
the
caterer
do
a
great
deal
but
i
use
to
weed
the
garden
tidy
up
the
house
get
my
neighbor
to
arrange
the
flower
and
generally
run
around

over
all
the
detail
include
how
many
portable

bring
in
for

we
print

despite
his

skill
phil

which
take
a
toll
on
his
endurance
and
his
health
he
suffer
from
numerous
illness
increasingly
so
as
the
year
go
by
there
be
moment
of
strain
between
us
mostly
when
he
drank
too
much
after
which
almost
inevitably
a
rather
violent
quarrel
would
ensue
follow
by
abject
apology
and
diminish
drinking
or
even
a
temporary
period
of
no
drinking
at
all
whenever
i
saw
the
drinking
begin
i
start
to
freeze
dread
the
inevitable
fight
i
grow
overworried
probably
i
could
have
handle
these
situation
well
if
i
have
be
calmer
about
them
but
i
couldn
t
be
he
be
usually
guilt
stricken
especially
if
there
have
be
a
sequence
of
unpleasant
episode
one
such
difficult
even
occur
in
the
spring
of
when
we
be
cohosts
at
a
large
party
we
all
refer
to
as
the
bankruptcy
ball
tom
and
joan
braden
have
come
to
town
tom
good
look
and
attractive
in
a
craggy
way
have
be
in
the
cia
and
joan
be
extremely
strong
sandy
haired
blue
eyed
with
a
mysterious
hold
on
the
opposite
sex
the
party
be
in
a
huge
but
almost
empty
house
across
the
potomac
on
the
virginia
side
where
the
bradens
be
living
at
the
time
with
the
first
few
of
their
eight
child
the
host
stewart
and
tish
alsop
joe
alsop
paul
and
phyllis
nitze
john
and
joanne
bross
frank
and
polly
wisner
and
ourselves
each
contribute
toward
the
expense
the
party
be
a
lot
of
fun
but
for
me
it
be
one
of
those
all
too
frequent
night
when
phil
have
too
much
to
drink
on
our
way
home
from
the
ball
he
told
me
to
stop
the
car
get
out
and
walk
for
a
while
fume
with
me
drive
slowly
alongside
finally
he
get
back
in
and
we
go
home
the
subject
of
his
drinking
be
never
openly
discuss
when
he
be
drinking
you
couldn
t
talk
about
it
when
he
go
on
the
wagon
i
always
hop
for
future
restraint
the
fight
be
never
in
public
the
rage
would
explode
after
we
have
left
a
place
and
be
usually
about
nothing
substantive
nothing
concrete
that
we
could
discus
rather
he
seem
to
seize
on
something
as
an
excuse
to
vent
his
rage
which
built
up
because
of
all
the
pressure
he
be
under
certainly
these
incident
could
have
be
early
sign
of
his
later
illness
but
i
never
suspect
that
phil
be
either
ill
or
depressed
or
that
that
might
have
be
the
reason
for
his
drinking
despite
these
difficulty
i
be
completely
immerse
in
phil
s
life
he
always
have
a
strong
desire
to
communicate
and
hat
be
alone
so
i
accompany
him
almost
everywhere
and
at
home
he
like
me
to
sit
and
talk
to
him
even
when
he
be
in
the
bathtub
consequently
i
be
very
aware
of
everything
in
his
day
s
work
whom
he
have
see
what
he
d
do
how
everything
be
go
he
be
particularly
good
at
recount
what
take
place
at
his
many
stag
evening
his
memory
be
so
photographic
that
he
could
recite
whole
conversation
or
re
create
entire
evening
in
minute
and
fascinate
detail
it
be
almost
well
than
be
there
since
he
have
a
great
sense
of
what
be
interest
and
funny
and
a
great
aversion
to
what
be
tedious
and
boring
in
the
early
day
i
often
drove
him
down
to
the
office
or
back
or
both
many
late
evening
i
would
sprawl
out
on
the
sofa
in
his
office
while
he
work
we
do
very
little
apart
from
each
other
one
memorable
time
when
i
do
do
something
separate
be
not
soon
repeat
barry
bingham
owner
of
the
louisville
courier
journal
who
have
become
a
friend
have
invite
us
to
the
kentucky
derby
but
just
before
we
be
suppose
to
leave
phil
say
he
felt
fluish
and
take
to
his
bed
when
i
call
the
binghams
to
tell
them
we
couldn
t
come
they
suggest
that
i
come
alone
i
distinctly
remember
be
very
surprised
at
be
ask
on
my
own
and
i
be
reluctant
to
leave
phil
when
he
be
ill
but
he
insist
that
i
go
so
i
do
the
weekend
be
an
endless
sea
of
party
and
race
with
the
one
important
race
happen
so
quickly
that
it
be
bewildering
for
someone
new
to
race
still
i
have
a
very
good
time
only
to
return
to
find
phil
in
a
fit
of
anger
he
admit
that
yes
he
have
urge
me
to
go
but
of
course
he
hadn
t
meant
it
and
hadn
t
like
be
left
alone
in
his
sickbed
again
as
with
his
drinking
i
interpret
phil
s
delicate
health
and
constant
illness
as
the
result
of
the
strain
on
him
and
the
fraught
competitive
situation
of
the
company
look
back
i
can
see
that
these
illness
too
be
likely
connect
with
his
more
basic
health
problem
of
which
there
be
no
real
sign
yet
in
retrospect
i
realize
that
the
more
difficult
moment
be
definitely
connect
with
mood
swing
but
i
and
indeed
the
world
be
dazzle
by
him
his
wit
great
energy
soar
imagination
and
fervent
desire
for
excellence
in
himself
and
in
others
be
so
strong
that
i
ignore
the
fact
that
he
be
frequently
use
that
wit
at
my
expense
phil
be
often
critical
or
cut
in
his
remark
when
thing
weren
t
just
right
either
about
the
house
or
my
clothes
for
example
which
left
lot
of
room
for
disparage
remark
oddly
what
i
never
perceive
at
the
time
be
that
though
he
be
lift
me
up
help
me
in
so
many
way
he
also
have
a
way
of
put
me
down
which
gradually
undermined
my
self
confidence
almost
entirely
nonetheless
phil
be
the
fizz
in
our
life
he
be
the
fun
at
the
dinner
table
and
in
our
country
life
he
have
the
idea
the
joke
the
game
he
operate
on
the
theory
that
it
be
important
to
do
with
the
child
only
those
thing
he
himself
enjoy
no
dull
board
game
but
hunt
fishing
walk
his
idea
dominate
our
life
everything
rotate
around
him
and
i
willingly
participate
in
keep
him
at
the
center
of
thing
in
fact
i
agree
with
almost
all
his
idea
i
remember
once
i
be
complain
about
have
injured
my
knee
by
step
on
a
ball
on
the
tennis
court
feel
rather
sorry
for
myself
in
a
plaster
cast
in
the
hot
summer
in
washington
i
whine
about
why
couldn
t
i
have
step
an
inch
to
the
right
or
an
inch
to
the
left
of
that
ball
i
will
always
remember
phil
look
at
me
smile
and
say
think
of
the
one
you
ve
miss
not
what
i
want
to
hear
at
that
moment
but
a
truth
that
stayed
with
me
for
life
he
always
manage
to
get
right
through
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
i
learn
such
a
lot
from
him
from
the
way
he
live
his
energy
be
infectious
he
didn
t
suffer
fool
gladly
as
evidence
in
his
failure
to
mince
word
i
recall
one
night
at
the
start
of
the
eisenhower
administration
when
the
new
secretary
of
the
treasury
george
humphrey
and
his
wife
come
to
dinner
at
our
house
i
overheard
mr
humphrey
tell
phil
what
a
great
sacrifice
george
have
make
to
come
to
washington
to
my
horror
i
heard
phil
respond
would
you
mind
if
i
told
you
something
frankly
mr
humphrey
not
at
all
be
her
reply
quite
rashly
if
she
have
know
phil
well
well
mr
humphrey
phil
say
make
that
remark
in
washington
be
like
belching
at
dinner
in
shaker
height
we
think
it
s
quite
a
privilege
to
be
secretary
of
the
treasury
needle
to
say
our
relationship
with
the
humphreys
never
progress
much
far
as
for
the
post
all
our
worry

particularly
over

several
short
strike
and
work
slowdown
by
the

nevertheless
we
be
publishing
ever
large
paper
occasionally
equal
or
even
surpass
the
star
important
move
have
be
put
in
motion
to
improve
far

break
even
more
or
less
with
huge
advance
have
be
make
in
the
business
area
especially
after
john
sweeterman
s
arrival
as
phil
write
to
john
how
great
be
the
obligation
of
this
entire
newspaper
to
you
you
have
do
all
and
more
than
i
ever
hop
for
and
wonder
upon
wonder
you
have
do
it
so
quickly
and
calmly
that
many
be
unaware
you
have
do
it
you
can
be
certain
i
be
not
among
them
despite
mccarthy
and
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
time
which
jeopardized
the
future
of
an
independent
newspaper
we
be
experience
the
high
advertising
and
circulation
increase
in
our
history
and
great
gain
on
the
news
and
editorial
side
contribute
to
the
post
s
be
increasingly
widely
recognize
it
s
a
salutary
nod
to
humility
to
realize
just
how
much
progress
have
be
make
by
my
father
and
by
phil
with
so
few
resource
and
such
enormous
odds
against
them
in
the
end
my
father
s
concentration
on
the
basic
principle
have
paid
off
handsomely
the
year
have
be
an
especially
good
one
for
the
post
which
phil
characteristically
played
down
by
say
it
do
not
mean
we
be
ready
for
retirement
but
at
least
we
be
a
couple
of
step
ahead
of
the
sheriff
what
make
the
outlook
even
well
be
a
letter
my
father
receive
in
the
begin
of
an
event
that
lead
up
to
what
i
still
think
of
as
the
define
moment
for
the
company
the
unexpected
acquisition
of
the
time
herald
the
letter
be
a
confidential
one
from
his
friend
kent
cooper
former
general
manager
of
the
associate
press
who
be
living
in
retirement
in
palm
beach
dad
arrive
at
our
door
that
morning
wave
the
letter
in
his
hand
obviously
excite
ask
where
s
phil
i
explain
he
have
go
to
jacksonville
i
ve
get
to
talk
to
him
right
away
this
be
really
important
my
father
then
go
to
the
post
where
he
threw
the
letter
on
john
sweeterman
s
desk
and
ask
what
do
you
think
the
letter
read
simply
i
be
wonder
whether
you
expect
to
be
in
palm
beach
any
time
soon
for
i
would
like
very
much
to
talk
to
you
about
a
business
matter
of
importance
to
you
sweeterman
reply
i
m
probably
think
the
same
thing
you
be
they
both
knew
that
cooper
be
a
good
friend
of
colonel
mccormick
s
that
he
live
near
him
and
that
he
be
likely
talk
about
the
time
herald
well
why
don
t
we
find
out
reply
my
father
and
immediately
put
in
a
phone
call
to
cooper
cryptically
he
ask
kent
this
business
matter
to
which
you
refer
be
it
in
the
field
of
journalism
cooper
say
that
it
be
be
it
in
washington
my
father
probed
again
cooper
say
yes
this
be
the
moment
we
have
fought
for
work
for
and
prayed
for
since
after
the
disappointment
in
when
the
colonel
have
step
in
our
hope
that
he
would
sell
at
all
much
less
sell
to
us
have
all
but
vanished
so
the
excitement
arouse
by
kent
cooper
s
letter
be
immense
several
development
have
occur
some
know
to
us
some
not
obviously
the
staff
of
the
time
herald
could
see
that
we
have
improve
our
financial
situation
markedly
their
paper
on
the
other
hand
be
not
do
nearly
so
well
in
the
end
colonel
mccormick
with
all
of
his
resource
and
the
venerable
chicago
tribune
behind
him
turn
out
to
be
not
nearly
so
formidable
in
washington
as
we
have
assume
he
would
be
the
time
herald
have
go
through
some
transition
of
its
own
in
the
colonel
have
fire
his
niece
and
the
time
herald
publisher
bazy
miller
bazy
have
divorce
her
husband
in
january
of
that
year
and
a
few
month
later
she
get
married
again
to
a
time
herald
editor
garvin
tankersley
the
colonel
i
be
told
at
the
time
didn
t
like
the
idea
of
her
divorce
a
husband
he
like
and
marry
someone
in
the
office
more
important
in
the
midterm
election
of
she
have
have
print
at
her
newspaper
s
plant
an
election
campaign
tabloid
from
the
record
which
come
from
senator
joseph
mccarthy
in
it
there
be
a
forge
picture
of
maryland
senator
millard
tydings
shake
hand
with
earl
browder
tydings
the
incumbent
lose
the
election
and
charge
that
the
tabloid
help
defeat
him
all
of
this
shock
the
colonel
who
be
both
straitlaced
and
ethical
he
replace
bazy
with
tribune
executive
who
didn
t
understand
anything
about
washington
or
run
a
paper
in
the
capital
city
they
put
out
a
paper
much
like
the
tribune
isolationist
right
wing
and
with
all
the
simplify
spell
that
have
be
use
in
chicago
sherif
fotograf
and
burocrat
so
the
problem
for
the
time
herald
begin
to
mount
we
have
no
idea
that
it
have
lose
thousand
of
subscriber
and
be
lose
half
a
million
dollar
or
more
each
year
moreover
the
colonel
be
get
along
in
year
and
his
health
be
fail
his
doctor
want
him
to
cut
down
his
responsibility
and
the
washington
paper
with
all
its
headache
seem
like
the
thing
to
let
go
kent
cooper
always
claimed
that
it
be
he
who
persuade
mccormick
to
sell
to
us
frank
waldrop
view
it
another
way
that
the
colonel
a
generous
man
have
let
cooper
be
a
go
between
in
order
to
give
him
some
sort
of
finder
s
fee
the
truth
probably
lie
somewhere
in
between
the
colonel
knew
that
the
time
herald
be
worth
more
to
the
post
than
to
anyone
else
still
mccormick
would
have
have
to
overcome
his
sharp
difference
of
view
with
my
father
as
well
as
his
resistance
to
sell
out
to
his
longtime
competitor
on
the
plus
side
what
it
all
may
have
come
down
to
be
that
mccormick
actually
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
my
father
whatever
his
reason
the
colonel
have
decide
to
sell
and
kent
cooper
sent
the
word
my
father
and
john
sweeterman
take
an
overnight
train
to
palm
beach
and
go
straight
to
the
brazilian
court
hotel
where
phil
met
them
then
phil
and
john
left
my
father
to
talk
to
kent
cooper
alone
the
message
be
that
colonel
mccormick
want
only
to
get
out
of
the
paper
what
he
have
put
into
it
which
be
million
my
father
say
do
it
be
a
bit
low
than
the
outer
limit
they
have
set
in
their
mind
cooper
stress
the
need
for
complete
secrecy
and
say
that
if
there
be
any
publicity
the
colonel
would
have
to
end
the
discussion
they
left
it
that
cooper
would
phone
my
father
later
that
afternoon
as
soon
as
he
have
have
a
chance
to
talk
to
mccormick
when
cooper
phone
he
confirm
that
mccormick
want
to
sell
but
that
he
could
not
act
without
discuss
matter
with
his
stockholder
all
of
this
would
take
several
week
time
since
his
doctor
have
told
him
he
shouldn
t
leave
florida
before
march
only
after
that
would
he
meet
in
chicago
with
his
director
and
stockholder
and
ask
for
authority
to
negotiate
with
my
father
cooper
told
us
there
be
nothing
to
worry
about
because
we
have
mccormick
s
word
which
be
good
but
six
week
of
hold
our
collective
breath
seem
a
lifetime
phil
john
and
my
father
return
to
washington
the
goal
we
have
sought
so
long
seem
within
reach
but
until
it
be
sign
seal
and
deliver
it
be
still
only
an
exhilarate
promise
almost
too
good
to
be
true
the
colonel
sell
to
us
we
have
never
dare
hope
for
such
a
scenario
my
parent
have
plan
a
vacation
trip
to
jamaica
and
worried
that
they
should
postpone
it

a

washington
post
company
we
now
have
the
morning
field
in
washington
to
ourselves
daily
circulation
jumped
immediately
from
to
and
sunday
circulation
rise
from
to
that
afternoon
and
even
however
before
we
hit
the
street
with
our
combine
paper
be
a
real
challenge
with
so
little
advance
planning
thing
be
chaotic
john
sweeterman
s
job
have
be
to
stay
at
the
post
and
plan
as
best
he
could
assume
the
deal
would
go
through
it
be
his
basic
plan
that
be
put
into
operation
and
make
the
whole
thing
work
the
purchase
brought
problem
for
us
of
course
as
a
result
of
add
all
the
feature
of
the
time
herald
we
be
run
a
more
than
double
press
run
of
a
large
paper
which
create
problem
in
itself
another
problem
be
the
time
herald
employee
not
absorbed
by
the
post
which
create
a
union
employee
situation
also
any
time
a
community
loses
a
paper
there
be
tension
unhappiness
displace
people
and
the
feel
that
a
voice
have
be
still
there
remain
three
paper
in
washington
though
so
people
didn
t
feel
that
they
be
at
the
mercy
of
one
voice
as
happen
later
in
most
city
combine
news
and
editorial
on
these
paper
be
difficult
since
we
have
two
very
opposite
culture
to
meld
the
time
herald
have
more
of
a
mass
audience
ours
be
more
of
a
class
audience
the
time
herald
have
be
load
with
feature
it
be
full
of
comic
columnist
especially
conservative
columnist
sport
gossip
sex
and
crime
the
post
be
more
serious
mind
and
didn
t
carry
all
the
fun
stuff
what
we
do
to
mute
the
criticism
we
knew
would
come
be
to
pick
up
from
the
time
herald
every
columnist
critic
comic
and
feature
of
any
kind
with
one
or
two
minor
exception
that
phil
and
rus
felt
unable
to
swallow
so
that
time
herald
subscriber
would
find
everything
they
care
about
still
there
in
the
paper
we
start
that
night
by
run
two
equal
size
name
on
the
masthead
the
washington
post
and
time
herald
gradually
over
a
period
of
year
we
shrank
the
size
of
print
for
the
name
time
herald
until
finally
it
disappear
altogether
when
we
put
the
two
paper
together
we
cover
the
market
in
fact
something
spark
in
the
combination
we
kept
the
circulation
of
both
paper
minus
the
overlap
and
then
start
to
grow
much
of
this
be
due
to
sweeterman
s
policy
what
he
have
do
be
continue
to
deliver
the
paper
to
all
the
time
herald
reader
even
if
they
have
try
to
cancel
their
subscription
this
way
they
have
time
to
look
through
the
paper
and
see
that
their
favorite
feature
be
still
there
as
john
say
they
just
rode
along
with
us
and
they
start
pay
their
carrier
bill
after
a
while
with
the
time
herald
circulation
that
we
held
we
have
percent
penetration
of
the
morning
market
in
the
washington
area
that
kind
of
coverage
and
the
particular
mix
of
the
combine
circulation
help
to
produce
volume
business
for
the
store
and
the
result
in
advertising
start
to
show
immediately
the
star
which
have
rely
on
advertiser
loyalty
be
so
self
satisfied
and
complacent
that
it
simply
go
on
do
what
it
have
be
do
its
idea
be
that
the
time
herald
circulation
didn
t
draw
advertising
by
itself
so
why
would
it
do
any
well
because
it
be
run
off
post
press
one
of
the
most
important
issue
one
that
actually
come
up
in
the
few
day
while
we
be
in
the
process
of
buying
the
paper
be
antitrust
gerry
gesell
handle
this
most
sensitive
issue
with
consummate
skill
we
want
to
buy
the
asset
of
the
time
herald
not
the
stock
since
the
clayton
antitrust
act
prohibit
acquisition
of
stock
but
not
of
asset
mccormick
on
the
other
hand
want
to
sell
his
stock
so
as
not
to
have
to
deal
with
the
people
problem
and
others
he
d
be
left
with
if
he
still
held
stock
he
just
want
to
sell
the
whole
company
we
obviously
be
not
in
a
position
to
argue
so
beebe
and
bradley
have
work
out
an
immediate
purchase
and
then
the
immediate
dissolution
of
the
time
herald
company
and
the
transfer
of
its
asset
that
be
all
do
and
the
bank
account
be
transfer
gesell
call
graham
claytor
later
secretary
of
the
navy
and
head
of
southern
railroad
and
have
him
come
up
from
roanoke
just
to
handle
the
principal
bank
account
so
there
be
no
money
left
no
anything
left
nothing
on
the
book
that
could
be
construe
as
suggest
there
be
any
kind
of
company
left
almost
immediately
after
that
phil
get
a
telephone
call
from
the
head
of
the
antitrust
division
at
the
justice
department
who
say
that
they
have
heard
rumor
that
the
post
be
acquire
the
time
herald
and
he
want
to
see
the
post
s
lawyer
right
away
phil
call
gesell
who
go
alone
to
the
justice
department
gesell
recall
later
that
the
division
head
be
in
his
private
office
with
nine
of
his
top
staff
i
knew
most
of
them
and
there
be
a
bunch
of
stern
face
a
justice
department
official
say
we
have
a
pretty
good
rumor
that
the
post
be
buying
the
time
herald
i
say
you
re
absolutely
right
they
bought
it
and
he
say
i
want
you
to
keep
the
two
company
separate
until
we
investigate
the
matter
i
say
well
i
m
sorry
we
can
t
do
that
we
ve
already
eliminate
the
company
it
doesn
t
exist
anymore
well
we
re
certainly
go
to
investigate
you
he
reply
and
i
say
well
thank
you
very
much
i
m
sure
it
s
legal
it
turn
out
that
there
be
a
clause
in
the
antitrust
law
call
the
fail
company
doctrine
which
make
an
exception
for
company
that
merge
if
both
of
them
be
fail
although
the
doctrine
have
never
really
apply
to
newspaper
because
newspaper
always
have
somebody
who
would
buy
them
gesell
have
decide
to
rely
on
this
many
conservative
some
in
congress
horrify
to
think
that
a
conservative
voice
be
go
to
be
take
away
by
what
be
in
their
view
the
lunatic
liberal
wing
of
american
journalism
lean
on
the
justice
department
to
bring
an
antitrust
suit
on
monopoly
ground
even
clare
booth
luce
of
all
people
told
phil
and
me
one
even
that
it
be
too
much
power
for
one
family
to
have
but
there
be
never
any
prosecution
one
sad
outcome
of
the
time
herald
acquisition
be
a
letter
from
my
sister
florence
to
my
father
deeply
unhappy
much
of
her
life
and
constantly
at
odds
with
the
family
flo
chose
this
moment
to
complain
that
her
absence
have
cause
her
and
her
boy
somehow
to
lose
out
either
financially
or
in
ownership
of
something
valuable
my
father
write
back
that
this
be
not
the
case
and
explain
that
no
one
in
the
family
would
be
any
poorer
he
later
report
to
us
that
flo
have
cable
back
in
an
entirely
satisfactory
way
and
fulfills
our
hope
for
her
well
understand
and
change
attitude
one
of
the
more
interest
sidelight
of
this
whole
thing
be
that
in
the
middle
of
the
purchase
and
merger
the
post
have
publish
what
we
regard
as
a
moderate
editorial
respond
to
a
televise
speech
by
vice
president
nixon
in
the
middle
of
which
he
remark
in
an
aside
incidentally
in
mention
secretary
dulles
isn
t
it
wonderful
finally
to
have
a
secretary
of
state
who
isn
t
take
in
by
the
communist
who
stand
up
to
them
we
can
be
sure
now
that
the
victory
our
men
win
on
the
battlefield
will
not
be
lose
in
the
future
by
our
diplomat
at
the
council
table
the
editorial
have
be
moderate
at
phil
s
order
just
before
he
disappear
into
negotiation
however
it
wasn
t
moderate
enough
to
suit
nixon
he
call
up
harry
gladstein
the
circulation
manager
and
cancel
his
subscription
to
the
post
both
at
home
and
at
the
office
harry
ask
phil
what
do
you
think
he
ll
do
in
the
morning
when
he
discovers
there
s
no
alternative
whereas
my
whole
memory
be
that
our
life
depend
on
our
get
the
time
herald
john
sweeterman
remembers
the
time
differently
and
perhaps
more
accurately
he
have
say
that
if
it
hadn
t
happen
as
it
do
we
would
have
fought
it
through
we
be
on
the
verge
of
lick
the
time
herald
we
have
them
beat
really
the
odds
be
in
our
favor
the
time
herald
didn
t
have
enough
of
a
foundation
they
be
a
hearst
type
newspaper
tight
operation
and
an
all
day
publishing
operation
which
be
kind
of
screwy
anyway
the
time
herald
couldn
t
have
continued
publishing
all
day
because
it
be
too
expensive
they
be
lose
money
more
than
we
be
so
that
sometime
sooner
or
later
they
would
have
go
away
from
that
all
day
paper
and
go
morning
then
it
would
have
be
more
of
a
decisive
battlefield
it
would
have
be
a
slow
costlier
prospect
and
operation
but
i
think
we
would
have
make
it
i
don
t
think
there
s
any
question
about
it
but
the
perception
phil
and
i
share
be
right
in
a
way
this
be
the
best
short
route
to
the
future
why
take
year
of
struggle
if
you
can
do
it
an
easy
way
there
be
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
struggle
to
survive
be
good
for
us
in
business
you
have
to
know
what
it
be
to
be
poor
and
stretch
and
fight
for
your
life
against
great
odds
many
of
the
young
people
on
the
paper
today
tend
to
think
that
the
franchise
be
bestow
on
the
post
and
to
take
it
for
grant
we
all
have
a
deep
fear
that
like
the
star
family
we
would
someday
become
self
satisfied
that
fear
permeates
our
family
down
to
don
graham
who
be
very
much
aware
of
all
these
event
as
a
child
we
paid
a
price
for
our
extraordinary
and
unexpectedly
great
success
we
raise
advertising
rate
but
not
enough
to
compensate
for
the
large
gain
in
circulation
so
the
paper
lose
the
first
year
but
that
wasn
t
important
twenty
one
year
after
my
father
have
bought
the
post
five
year
after
phil
have
be
so
disappointed
at
lose
the
time
herald
the
post
have
bought
its
competitor
in
what
be
probably
the
most
successful
newspaper
merger
ever
double
our
circulation
overnight
and
propel
the
paper
into
a
much
more
prosperous
future
this
purchase
be
what
make
us
a
viable
company
with
a
future
toward
which
we
could
look
with
some
certainty
and
a
foundation
on
which
we
could
build
at
last
after
my
father
s
struggle
which
phil
have
share
for
more
than
eight
year
we
could
begin
to
believe
that
the
post
be
here
to
stay
chapter
thirteen
phil
and
i
be

comfortable

between
their
knee
our
life
at
glen
welby
be
only
one
aspect
of
this
period
when
all

seemingly
right
with
our
world
my

brought
strong
reaction
the
positive
one
of
which
she
be
only
too
happy
to
share
with
us
like
a
clip
she
sent
us
from
the
richmond
news
leader
a
staunch
conservative
southern
paper
that
have
reprint
a

of
hers
along
with
an
editorial
say
today
the
supreme
court
instead
of
follow
the
flag
follow
the
washington
post
a
richmond
citizen
write
her
that
her
speech
be
one
of
the
noble
utterance
he
have
ever
read
in
the
tradition
of
jefferson
and
lincoln
with
her
normal
breathtaking
assurance
she
told
us
you
ought
to
read
it
some
day
it
be
actually
one
of
the
lofty
thing
i
have
ever
write
strong
emersonian
influence
tension
between
phil
and
my
mother
escalate
temporarily
in
the
mid
s
because
of
a
disagreement
over
the
location
of
a
propose
auditorium
and
cultural
center
for
washington
she
be
chairman
of
the
auditorium
commission
and
want
the
center
locate
along
the
potomac
riverfront
in
the
foggy
bottom
area
of
washington
where
the
watergate
apartment
be
later
built
he
thought
it
should
be
part
of
the
redevelopment
of
southwest
washington
with
which
he
be
heavily
involve
concede
that
the
foggy
bottom
area
provide
a
beautiful
potomac
river
site
phil
nevertheless
believe
strongly
that
place
the
auditorium
in
southwest
washington
be
an
important
step
toward
discourage
white
flight
to
the
suburb
and
upgrade
a
community
of
people
in
the
southwest
from
mother
s
point
of
view
and
that
of
her
commission
the
river
site
be
perfect
and
put
the
auditorium
in
southwest
would
have
end
the
whole
project
since
she
felt
she
couldn
t
raise
money
to
build
in
a
slum
she
rail
at
phil
and
at
those
in
congress
who
be
oppose
to
her
point
of
view
accuse
them
of
have
be
reach
by
real
estate
interest
and
vowed
that
if
the
southwest
area
of
the
city
be
chosen
as
the
site
she
and
her
whole
commission
would
resign
in
a
p
s
to
one
letter
to
him
about
the
issue
she
add
i
would
like
to
write
an
analysis
of
the
factor
involve
in
foggy
bottom
v
s
w
for
next
sunday
s
post
if
you
don
t
want
it
i
hope
you
don
t
mind
if
i
offer
it
to
the
star
incredible
even
in
retrospect
yet
phil
could
honestly
say
that
after
sixteen
year
he
approve
of
my
mother
despite
an
occasional
impulse
to
matri
in
law
cide
the
two
of
them
have
a
curious
conflict
but
very
deep
bond
despite
the
endless
duel
over
her
relationship
to
the
paper
during
this
period
my
father
be
more
and
more
remove
from
the
day
to
day
operation
of
the
paper
and
the
company
but
no
less
interested
than
ever
when
they
be
not
in
the
same
city
phil
sent
him
letter
and
memo
recount
meeting
speech
port
related
activity
and
so
on
dad
be
clearly
age
but
his
mind
be
sharp
and
his
judgment
and
perspective
be
still
sought
by
phil
and
others
he
turn
eighty
the
year
after
the
purchase
of
the
time
herald
and
he
clearly
be
think
about
the
implication
of
age
in
april
of
he
sent
a
memo
to
rus
wiggins
note
the
significance
of
the
death
of
two
newspaper
legend
that
week
joe
pulitzer
die
on
wednesday
bertie
mccormick
die
on
thursday
and
i
have
just
left
to
see
my
doctor
for
a
while
dad
have
be
contemplate
the
idea
of
leave
some
stock
to
post
employee
phil
suggest
to
him
that
it
would
be
nicer
to
give
it
to
them
while
he
be
still
alive
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
observe
their
pleasure
dad
agree
eventually
tell
the
recipient
for
some
time
mr
meyer
and
i
have
be
think
about
the
fine
people
in
this
organization
we
have
a
lively
memory
of
the
value
service
of
those
of
you
who
over
the
year
have
help
bring
about
this
institution
s
success
we
have
want
to
find
some
appropriate
way
of
mark
our
appreciation
some
people
remember
their
old
associate
in
their
will
but
mr
meyer
and
i
both
thought
that
a
rather
melancholy
approach
to
thing
what
he
do
be
to
work
out
the
detail
for
give
a
half
million
dollar
of
nonvoting
stock
to
of
the
paper
s
employee
and
independent
circulation
dealer
in
essence
everyone
with
five
or
more
year
of
continuous
service
in
the
company
the
gift
range
from
four
to
twenty
share
the
fair
market
value
of
each
share
be
work
out
by
price
waterhouse
to
be
my
father
write
to
all
the
recipient
explain
the
gift
and
add
that
he
and
my
mother
hop
they
would
retain
their
share
at
least
as
long
as
they
be
associate
with
the
post
we
believe
the
stock
be
a
good
investment
with
the
enthusiastic
help
and
cooperation
of
everyone
in
the
post
organization
it
should
increase
in
value
over
the
year
several
people
understood
the
stock
s
value
from
the
begin
and
bought
all
they
could
from
those
who
didn
t
many
sell
to
each
other
but
those
who
simply
hung
on
or
bought
five
ten
or
fifteen
share
be
richly
reward
as
the
company
grow
and
go
public
one
share
become
sixty
share
when
we
go
public
and
since
we
go
public
at
and
split
the
stock
twice
these
initial
gift
eventually
become
worth
a
great
deal
the
stock
distribution
gift
be
announce
in
a
memorable
lunch
at
the
statler
hotel
in
june
of
an
event
that
also
serve
to
commemorate
the
twenty
second
anniversary
of

his

with

and
continue
after
the
laughter
subside
well
you
never
know
you
start
out
for
work
as
a
wage
earner
and
you
come
home
a
capitalist
despite
my
pleasure
in
the
life
i
be
lead
during
these
year
i
can
see
now
that
i
be
have
problem
i
didn
t
acknowledge
to
myself
i
be
grow
shyer
and
less
confident
as
i
get
old
i
still
didn
t
know
how
to
look
my
best
or
how
to
handle
myself
in
social
situation
i
be
afraid
of
be
boring
and
go
on
believe
that
people
related
to
us
entirely
because
of
phil
it
s
hard
to
convey
how
unsure
i
felt
or
why
or
to
explain
how
i
could
have
be
so
unaware
at
the
time
at
some
point
during
this
period
i
attend
a
lady
lunch
give
by
lady
bird
johnson
for
the
wife
of
member
of
congress
and
a
few
newspaper
wife
helen
lippmann
sally
reston
and
me
after
lunch
lady
bird
ask
everyone
to
stand
up
and
say
what
she
d
do
the
summer
before
most
of
the
woman
have
campaign
for
their
husband
and
spoke
about
that
i
be
paralyze
with
fear
at
the
thought
of
speak
in
front
of
this
group
and
be
absolutely
unable
to
utter
a
word
what
s
more
i
refuse
to
try
on
another
occasion
i
do
make
a
speech
follow
a
text
to
about
sixty
people
on
a
study
i
have
head
up
for
a
year
have
to
do
with
adoption
and
foster
care
and
with
child
take
out
of
their
family
home
this
must
have
be
my
maiden
speechmaking
effort
and
i
be
terrify
with
phil
s
help
i
write
and
rewrote
it
a
number
of
time
and
manage
to
get
through
the
ordeal
but
the
cost
to
me
in
anxiety
be
utterly
out
of
proportion
to
the
event
maybe
my
friend
and
i
have
very
good
woman
friend
perceive
what
i
didn
t
early
in
lead
by
polly
wisner
they
give
a
party
in
my
honor
dubbed
salute
to
katharine
graham
i
be
pleased
but
puzzle
as
to
why
they
have
do
it
it
be
no
doubt
to
bolster
me
because
they
thought
i
need
it
but
i
honestly
have
no
sense
of
need
attention
my
insecurity
have
something
to
do
with
both
my
mother
and
phil
my
mother
seem
to
undermine
so
much
of
what
i
do
subtly
belittling
my
choice
and
my
activity
in
light
of
her
great
more
important
one
my
very
eccentric
relation
with
her
be
exemplify
in
an
incident
of
these
year
i
would
often
call
on
her
when
she
be
in
bed
or
rest
we
would
endlessly
discus
her
activity
and
speech
intersperse
with
occasional
contribution
from
me
about
the
child
one
day
i
decide
very
deliberately
that
i
would
bring
up
my
project
to
get
child
out
of
junior
village
a
large
shelter
in
the
district
and
into
foster
home
it
take
some
courageous
determination
but
i
start
to
say
she
might
be
interested
in
some
work
i
be
do
as
i
go
on
she
cut
me
off
decisively
say
oh
darling
i
give
up
on
the
district
year
ago
so
end
my
abortive
effort
to
talk
with
her
about
something
that
matter
to
me
as
for
phil
at
the
same
time
that
he
be
building
me
up
he
be
tear
me
down
as
he
emerge
more
on
the
journalistic
and
political
scene
i
increasingly
saw
my
role
as
the
tail
to
his
kite
and
the
more
i
felt
overshadow
the
more
it
become
a
reality
he
always
have
a
very
sharp
wit
and
sometimes
a
cruel
humor
i
d
see
it
use
in
many
social
situation
and
occasionally
friend
of
ours
be
the
target
he
would
utter
some
harsh
truth
in
such
a
humorous
way
that
most
of
the
time
he
get
away
with
it
with
even
the
target
of
his
wit
join
in
the
laughter
increasingly
however
the
wit
he
have
turn
on
others
he
now
turn
on
me
i
become
the
butt
of
the
family
joke
strangely
i
be
still
so
mesmerize
by
him
that
i
didn
t
perceive
what
be
happen
and
even
played
along
with
it
because
i
have
gain
some
weight
though
not
that
much
he
start
to
call
me
porky
he
even
give
me
a
french
butcher
shop
tole
head
of
a
pig
which
i
put
up
on
the
porch
at
glen
welby
think
it
be
funny
another
habit
of
his
that
emerge
during
these
year
be
that
when
we
be
with
friend
and
i
be
talk
he
would
look
at
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
felt
i
be
go
on
too
long
and
boring
people
gradually
i
cease
talk
much
at
all
when
we
be
out
together
i
recognize
none
of
this
condescension
at
the
time
but
one
lengthy
letter
phil
write
my
mother
at
the
end
of
reflect
it
she
have
sent
him
an
article
about
thomas
mann
and
he
respond
clearly
betraying
a
superior
attitude
that
he
share
with
my
mother
ever
since
reading
the
education
of
h
adam
and
mont
san
michel
et
chartres
i
ve
be
completely
at
sea
about
the
meaning
of
unity
prior
thereto
i
be
innocent
of
the
existence
of
the
concept
you
do
however
fail
to
underscore
the
single
most
salient
sentence
i
e
no
erudition
be
need
for
the
enjoyment
of
felix
krull
this
atomic
thought
have
even
lead
me
to
play
with
the
idea
of
recommend
the
volume
to
my
life
s
companion
quite
an
odd
remark
about
someone
who
have
probably
read
more
of
mann
than
he
have
and
who
have
read
the
two
henry
adam
book
well
before
he
do
and
have
recommend
them
to
him
yet
despite
all
this
i
fail
to
recognize
how
aggressive
his
behavior
to
me
have
become
i
have
learn
so
much
from
him
that
i
felt
like
trilby
to
his
svengali
i
felt
as
though
he
have
create
me
and
that
i
be
totally
dependent
on
him
even
now
i
can
t
sort
out
my
feeling
about
this
it
s
hard
to
separate
what
be
a
function
of
phil
s
terrible
affliction
which
manifest
itself
only
later
and
what
be
more
basic
the
truth
be
that
i
adore
him
and
saw
only
the
positive
side
of
what
he
be
do
for
me
i
simply
didn
t
connect
my
lack
of
self
confidence
with
his
behavior
toward
me
although
the
pace
of
phil
s
work
life
be
brutal
he
still
seem
to
thrive
on
it
there
be
shadow
develop
but
they
be
so
slight
that
i
didn
t
see
them
or
didn
t
perceive
them
as
shadow
look
back
i
see
that
his
constant
physical
ailment
be
a
prelude
to
his
mental
affliction
to
a
latent
disease
of
which
i
or
indeed
he
be
totally
unaware
his
increase
bout
with
virus
meant
that
he
would
return
to
an
office
pile
high
as
he
told
a
friend
with
defer
crisis
and
accrue
catastrophe
nonetheless
when
he
be
well
there
be
still
no
one
who
could
well
tackle
these
crisis
and
catastrophe
phil
be
now
manage
the
greatly
enlarge
post
and
time
herald
john
sweeterman
played
the
chief
role
under
him
and
take
most
of
the
responsibility
for
business
decision
but
phil
be
very
much
the
chief
strategist
always
he
be
more
involve
in
editorial
issue
with
rus
wiggins
and
on
the
editorial
page
with
estabrook
but
john
and
rus
enable
him
to
focus
on
the
large
issue
dip
into
the
day
to
day
activity
of
the
paper
only
as
he
chose
in
this
period
he
spent
almost
as
much
time
on
his
many
outside
activity
as
on
the
paper
itself
but
he
manage
to
keep
everything
not
only
in
hand
but
progress
by
the
fall
of
phil
be
busier
than
eight
bird
dog
in
large
part
because
of
negotiation
with
cbs
to
purchase
its
minority
interest
in
the
post
s
station
wtop
though
the
timing
of
this
be
a
little
awkward
give
that
it
be
only
about
six
month
since
the
purchase
of
the
time
herald
we
have
always
be
interested
in
own
all
of
wtop
television
and
radio
and
this
be
our
chance
the
price
for
cbs
s
percent
interest
be
million
it
be
a
dare
move
on
phil
s
part
to
increase
our
debt
have
just
undertaken
a
major
expansion
but
it
be
another
one
that
paid
off
handsomely
in
the
end
by
the
star
be
finally
find
it
necessary
to
do
a
little
work
within
a
year
of
the
purchase
of
the
time
herald
we
have
equal
or
pass
the
star
in
many
important
category
have
be
the
lead
paper
in
washington
for
a
hundred
year
the
star
now
found
itself
with
about
few
reader
than
the
post
though
we
continued
to
lag
behind
in
advertising
the
arrival
of
frank
gatewood
from
the
old
time
herald
to
work
on
advertising
make
a
great
difference
retail
store
be
wed
to
the
star
but
gatewood
persuade
some
of
the
big
account
to
give
us
a
large
portion
than
before
frank
be
so
valuable
that
my
father
joked
that
he
have
paid
million
just
to
get
him
on
the
post
once
it
get
roll
gatewood
recall
advertising
improve
very
fast
and
the
post
go
from
have
percent
of
the
field
to
percent
in
three
year
from
on
post
profit
exceed
those
of
the
star
cost
be
tightly
control
when
we
look
at
the
size
of
the
post
today
and
think
of
the
foreign
correspondent
in
bureau
around
the
world
it
s
difficult
to
recall
a
time
when
the
foreign
reporting
be
do
from
washington
or
when
only
news
service
be
use
but
it
be
not
so
long
ago
and
when
phil
sent
murrey
marder
to
london
as
the
post
s
first
foreign
correspondent
in
january
what
murrey
write
be
to
be
share
with
wtop
which
be
pay
some
of
his
expense
not
until
five
year
later
be
two
other
correspondent
add
and
phil
foisie
be
charge
with
edit
foreign
news
essentially
become
the
first
foreign
editor
under
foisie
the
foreign
service
later
grow
to
twenty
three
people
abroad
with
many
stringer
to
supplement
the
correspondent
not
all
of
them
first
rate
as
time
go
on
phil
get
increasingly
involve
with
public
and
political
event
and
the
post
begin
to
take
less
of
his
time
some
of
the
thing
he
do
make
him
more
visible
in
the
local
national
and
business
community
as
well
as
in
political
sphere
but
all
the
thing
he
do
be
do
because
he
believe
in
them
many
of
his
outside
activity
have
be
go
on
for
several
year
the
university
of
chicago
board
action
a
committee
on
housing
the
council
on
economic
development
the
ad
council
southwest
redevelopment
and
d
c
home
rule
others
begin
in
the
mid
s
and
grow
increasingly
political
despite
the
intensity
of
his
involvement
in
elect
eisenhower
in
phil
have
quickly
become
disenchant
with
the
administration
and
have
be
develop
a
commitment
of
time
and
energy
to
senator
lyndon
baines
johnson
i
m
not
sure
what
trigger
his
relationship
with
johnson
but
it
now
seem
predictable
even
foreordain
johnson
work
actively
to
cultivate
the
press
and
phil
be
always
drawn
to
politics
they
both
love
power
and
its
use
for
what
they
thought
of
as
desirable
purpose
they
be
both
from
the
south
both
be
full
of
humor
with
an
edge
they
have
a
natural
affinity
as
early
as
phil
have
begin
steady
exchange
with
the
senator
in
january
johnson
sent
phil
a
list
of
democratic
committee
assignment
for
the
come
year
he
have
circle
what
he
view
as
the
key
new
appointment
and
attach
a
note
remind
phil
of
their
talk
in
the
past
about
the
need
for
assure
a
great
representation
of
your
member
and
of
conflict
point
of
view
upon
the
stand
committee
of
congress
in
thank
him
phil
refer
to
an
editorial
the
post
have
just
print
title
best
foot
forward
which
praise
the
committee
assignment
make
by
the
democratic
steer
committee
under
senator
lyndon
johnson
s
leadership
as
have
give
the
liberal
northerner
of
the
party
generous
opportunity
on
key
committee
as
well
as
signal
a
degree
of
unity
never
achieve
while
the
party
be
in
power
as
you
can
see
write
phil
we
thought
you
have
do
a
fine
job
lbj
appreciate
the
editorial
and
write
phil
to
thank
him
some
month
later
johnson
sent
phil
one
of
his
speech
and
a
note
about
the
vote
on
his
resolution
against
the
spread
of
communism
to
the
western
hemisphere
phil
actually
write
back
thank
lyndon
for
not
bawling
me
out
for
the
skimpy
job
we
do
on
it
the
day
it
come
out
i
hope
we
have
make
some
later
amends
these
exchange
reflect
a
relationship
in
which
the
press
be
closer
to
government
than
journalist
ought
to
be
at
least
today
however
for
those
time
for
that
decade
it
be
not
unusual
the
problem
be
that
their
relationship
grow
even
closer
and
though
there
be
still
some
constructive
ramification
there
be
to
be
certain
negative
one
for
me
later
on
in
the
midterm
campaign
of
vice
president
nixon
with
whom
phil
have
be
impressed
in
become
highly
vitriolic
his
tactic
lead
herblock
to
draw
one
of
his
most
famous
cartoon
nixon
crawl
out
of
a
sewer
as
a
band
and
an
official
group
greet
him
the
head
man
hold
a
placard
reading
here
he
come
now
despite
nixon
s
effort
the
democrat
retook
control
of
the
house
and
the
senate
make
lyndon
johnson
the
senate
majority
leader
from
this
point
on
phil
and
johnson
become
even
closer
one
keen
interest
of
phil
s
be
clean
election
and
campaign
finance
reform
he
take
up
the
study
of
the
role
of
money
in
politics
early
in
speak
out
and
write
about
it
in
the
hope
of
get
something
do
as
usual
he
be
ahead
of
his
time
on
a
problem
that
be
to
get
dramatically
bad
people
be
not
even
aware
of
the
true
cost
of
campaign
he
argue
there
be
a
huge
discrepancy
between
what
be
report
as
spent
by
the
national
committee
of
the
two
major
political
party
and
what
be
actually
spent
as
he
saw
it
most
of
the
money
for
campaign
come
from
three
source
the
underworld
special
interest
group
and
the
hopeful
that
be
people
who
contribute
in
the
expectation
of
receive
high
public
office
as
he
state
it
in
a
speech
phil
saw
the
problem
as
how
can
we
raise
enough
honest
untainted
money
to
permit
our
politician
to
run
for
office
without
become
obligate
to
corrupt
or
selfish
force
and
in
do
this
how
can
we
help
to
create
a
high
regard
for
the
importance
of
politics
in
the
american
future
his
solution
be
to
look
to
the
individual
good
citizen
a
gallup
poll
have
found
that
one
third
of
american
family
be
prepared
to
give
politically
phil
thought
an
advertising
campaign
could
inform
people
and
persuade
both
that
one
third
and
others
to
contribute
in
order
to
end
corruption
he
argue
that
if
this
thoroughly
doable
thing
be
indeed
do
it
should
constitute
the
single
most
important
political
reform
of
our
time
full
account
of
this
speech
be
carry
in
the
post
and
the
idea
become
know
as
the
graham
plan
the
follow
year
phil
persuade
lyndon
johnson
of
the
need
for
legislation
though
the
senate
seem
accord
to
phil
scar
stiff
about
the
possibility
of
what
might
come
out
if
pandora
s
box
be
open
johnson
be
seriously
enough
agitate
to
be
most
amenable
to
almost
any
reform
i
want
to
propose
phil
s
work
be
all
behind
the
scene
because
as
he
admit
we
can
be
useful
only
so
long
as
the
numerous
prima
donna
be
get
all
the
credit
after
much
discussion
with
lbj
focus
on
a
bipartisan
program
of
reform
a
bill
be
draft
and
eighty
five
senator
sign
on
as
cosponsors
which
have
never
happen
before
in
the
senate
s
history
it
seem
only
one
vote
against
the
bill
which
be
as
phil
told
my
father
not
a
completely
perfect
bill
but
a
good
step
forward
but
the
bill
fail
to
pas
the
house
i
have
doubt
perhaps
wrongly
that
lyndon
johnson
really
want
the
bill
and
have
told
phil
so
my
feel
be
that
johnson
want
to
cultivate
his
relationship
with
phil
and
chose
this
route
to
do
it
but
phil
s
enthusiasm
for
both
the
bill
and
the
senator
kept
grow
and
despite
the
failure
of
the
bill
they
undoubtedly
become
even
closer
after
work
together
on
it
unlike
phil
i
be
still
drawn
to
adlai
stevenson
though
my
mother
met
him
before
i
do
she
be
undergo
a
political
transformation
which
like
everything
she
do
be
carry
to
extreme
her
doubt
about
eisenhower
be
confirm
when
she
have
try
and
fail
to
interest
him
and
his
administration
in
the
social
issue
that
matter
so
much
to
her

urgent
she

that
he
have
no
money

preparatory
political
expense
for
the
next
campaign

she
thought
he
ought
to
be
freed
of
that
worry
she
told
phil
that
nothing
would
give
her
as
much
happiness
as
know
that
this
have
be
do
phil
agree
to
arrange
it
and
promptly
do
that
fall
phil
be
go
to
be
make
a
speech
in
chicago
and
write
to
adlai
suggest
that
we
three
get
together
which
we
do
adlai
himself
drove
us
to
the
suburb
of
chicago
where
he
have
a
beautiful
farm
with
a
pretty
informal
ramble
house
in
which
his
family
of
three
son
have
grown
up
and
in
which
he
now
live
alone
for
me
this
be
the
begin
of
a
pleasant
but
complicate
relationship
phil
and
adlai
have
a
less
reward
time
together
phil
have
know
adlai
for
quite
a
while
and
thought
him
an
obviously
able
and
talented
man
but
he
worried
that
adlai
couldn
t
compare
as
a
politician
to
lyndon
johnson
and
he
later
come
to
share
the
view
held
by
many
that
stevenson
be
too
indecisive
and
not
tough
mind
enough
nevertheless
phil
take
the
paper
back
to
a
policy
of
nonendorsement
as
expect
president
eisenhower
be
reelect
by
a
wide
margin
stevenson
s
concession
be
notable
for
its
high
spirit
and
hearten
word
when
ask
on
the
night
of
the
election
whether
he
would
ever
try
for
the
presidency
again
he
respond
i
m
a
candidate
for
bed
in
one
of
his
letter
to
phil
that
summer
before
the
election
lbj
have
casually
invite
phil
and
me

bit
of
texas
hospitality
throughout
the
fall
he
go
on
urge
us
to
come
and
an
opportunity
arose
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
phil
be
ask
to
speak
at
texas
a
m
university
phil
accepted
in
part
so
we

own
a
small
plane
that

through
the
procedure

drive
over
the
field
and
through
the

lbj
be
most
eager
for
phil
to
shoot
phil
who
love
hunt
bird
in
part
because
they
be
hard
to
shoot
which
meant
he
mostly
miss
them
couldn
t
stand
the
idea
of
kill
a
deer
our
host
however
consider
it
a
matter
of
successful
hospitality
to
have
his
guest
return
home
with
one
when
we
come
across
a
little
group
of
deer
on
a
hill
just
ahead
of
us
phil
take
aim
on
lbj
s
order
shoot
phil
the
senator
bark
with
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
point
and
ready
phil
respond
i
can
t
shoot

in
the
as
lyndon
when
one
of
the
deer
turn
toward
us
johnson
urge
him
again
to
shoot
this
time
phil
respond
i
can

look
like

several

s
favorite
the

ran
off
leave
the
senator
really
cross
with
his
reluctant
guest
the
next
time
a
deer
appear
phil
realize
he
have
no
choice
but
to
comply
and
he
shot
his
deer
the
visit
be
an
odd
one
for
me
phil
and
lyndon
be
completely
comfortable
with
each
other
but
lyndon
regard
me
quite
differently
he
would
look
straight
at
me
separate
me
from
him
and
phil
and
begin
whatever
he
be
about
to
say
with
you
northern
liberal
he
hammer
point
home
with
me
as
though
try
to
explain
to
me
how
the
world
really
work
on
one
occasion
he
spent
a
long
time
tell
me
the
story
of
how
civil
right
come
to
johnson
city
relate
they
be
building
a
highway
that
be
to
go
through
town
the
roadgang
have
some
negras
on
it
none
have
ever
be
allow
to
stay
overnight
in
johnson
city
before
but
the
road
come
nearer
and
nearer
and
finally
arrive
the
town
bully
found
the
head
of
the
roadgang
in
the
barber
shop
go
up
to
him
and
say
get
them

by
tonight
the
head
of
the
roadgang
take
his
bib
off
get
up
out
of
the
barber
s
chair
and
those
two
wrestle
each
other
up
and
down
main
street
until
the
roadgang
head
have
the
bully
pin
down
on
the
street
at
which
point
he
beat
his
head
on
the
pavement
as
he
repeat
can
i
keep
my
nigger
can
i
keep
my
nigger
finally
the
bully
say
yes
that
s
how
civil
right
come
to
johnson
city
in
truth
i
regard
lbj
with
mixed
feeling
at
that
time
i
still
believe
that
to
some
extent
he
be
use
phil
and
i
certainly
wasn
t
ready
to
embrace
him
entirely
as
phil
seem
to
have
do
one
night
he
and
phil
put
away
a
good
deal
of
whiskey
both
during
and
after
dinner
in
our
late
night
talk
johnson
start
complain
about
the
press
as
will
politician
of
any
persuasion
in
the
middle
of
his
diatribe
he
say
you
can
buy
any
one
of
them
with
a
bottle
of
whiskey
i
be
much
too
reticent
to
enter
into
the
conversation
or
to
object
but
when
phil
and
i
go
upstairs
i
denounce
lyndon
for
say
what
he
have
say
and
phil
for
let
it
go
unchallenged
apparently
lady
bird
have
similar
word
for
lyndon
because
he
be
very
different
the
next
morning
urge
us
to
stay
over
another
day
which
we
do
at
lunch
before
we
left
he
give
us
both
present
a
large
ten
gallon
western
hat
for
phil
and
a
charm
bracelet
for
me
with
a
little
texas
map
a
microphone
and
other
symbol
of
the
johnson
world
hang
from
it
when
it
hit
my
hand
it
be
so
heavy
i
realize
it
be
gold
the
press
be
not
suppose
to
accept
present
and
these
gift
troubled
me
deeply
especially
in
the
context
of
that
conversation
which
still
rankle
phil
told
me
to
accept
the
bracelet
he
would
keep
the
hat
and
we
would
return
a
gift
of
equal
value
which
we
do
a
water
purifier
johnson
have
mention
need
as
we
left
the
ranch
we
be
hand
a
large
cardboard
box
contain
phil
s
frozen
deer
and
sausage
already
make
from
it
the
mount
deer
head
be
to
follow
as
it
happen
the
whole
east
coast
be
sock
in
by
fog
and
rain
so
our
plane
circle
endlessly
above
the
bad
weather
and
finally
land
in
pittsburgh
from
where
we
caught
a
train
to
washington
in
the
middle
of
the
night
unable
to
cope
with
the
huge
box
of
deer
meat
we
simply
left
it
on
the
station
platform
the
head
sent
later
still
decorates
the
library
at
glen
welby
a
few
day
after
we
return
from
the
ranch
visit
phil
handwrote
johnson
a
rough
but
lengthy
memo
as
the
basis
for
some
important
general
idea
for
far
discussion
what
he
be
do
be
give
lbj
advice
on
how
to
improve
his
image
nationally
argue
that
the
senator
need
to
counteract
the
reputation
he
have
as
a
conservative
sectional
and
oil
and
gas
interest
motivate
politician
phil
believe
that
this
be
a
false
stereotype
that
have
weaken
johnson
s
national
effectiveness
but
that
it
have
to
some
extent
be
accepted
by
lbj
and
his
staff
who
seem
only
to
be
concentrate
on
reelection
in
texas
in
phil
argue
that
lyndon
have
a
role
to
play
in
truly
national
politics
and
if
he
be
to
do
so
he
have
to
remember
that
the
best
defense
be
a
good
offense
and
to
begin
erase
the
inaccurate
stereotype
by
pave
the
way
for
a
legislative
session
marked
by
a
high
order
of
accomplishment
phil
also
contend
that
lyndon
should
announce
a
legislative
program
for
in
a
press
conference
time
so
as
not
to
be
quashed
by
the
republican
president
s
state
of
the
union
address
he
then
suggest
that
lyndon
follow
up
with
a
major
address
before
the
best
possible
audience
which
would
have
several
principle
theme
of
which
perhaps
the
most
important
be
to
create
and
articulate
a
realistic
philosophy
on
civil
right
which
be
to
be
strengthen
as
he
elaborate
it
that
philosophy
need
to
be
not
one
base
solely
on
texas
acceptability
rather
one
which
go
a
bit
beyond
russell
and
yet
far
short
of
humphrey
and
which
at
the
same
time
be
realistically
suit
to
the
time
and
to
the
possibility
of
congressional
action
in
the
johnson
presidential
library
there
be
a
memo
to
senator
johnson
from
george
reedy
who
be
then
one
of
lbj
s
staff
assistant
reedy
s
memo
be
attach
to
phil
s
and
comment
on
it
he
thought
phil
s
idea
be
sound
but
i
do
not
agree
with
his
timing
in
addition
reedy
say
phil
life
in
the
washington
post
atmosphere
and
that
atmosphere
have
great
influence
in
washington
i
have
an
idea
that
out
in
the
country
you
be
much
more
popular
than
would
be
apparent
from
the
drew
pearson
column
and
the
herblock
cartoon
the
washington
post
atmosphere
be
highly
specialized
and
be
not
reflect
in
very
many
other
community
i
believe
that
in
this
case
phil
be
closer
to
the
truth
than
reedy
be
throughout
the
early
month
of
phil
be
still
active
on
all
front
one
of
his
significant
achievement
at
this
time
be
exchange
post
stock
held
by
the
meyer
foundation
which
place
the
ownership
of
the
business
completely
in
our
hand
he
be
also
constantly
involve
in
labor
negotiation
particularly
with
the
newspaper
guild
a
contract
that
be
sign
in
the
spring
of
come
after
eight
and
a
half
long
month
of
negotiation
but
brought
with
it
an
unprecedented
five
year
agreement
another
important
thing
he
do
around
this
time
be
to
make
an
extraordinarily
blunt
speech
about
the
teamster
effort
to
organize
our
circulation
department
as
they
have
that
of
the
star
it
be
report
to
us
that
jack
kauffmann
then
publisher
of
the
star
have
agree
to
negotiate
with
the
teamster
if
they
come
over
and
get
us
to
do
the
same
phil
s
speech
handwritten
on
a
legal
pad
say
that
if
the
star
be
contract
with
the
teamster
union
you
can
be
sure
somebody
be
go
to
ask
you
to
join
the
teamster
they
will
probably
tell
you
that
you
have
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
the
situation
be
just
the
reverse
phil
warn
you
will
have
everything
to
lose
and
nothing
to
gain
he
also
told
them
in
no
uncertain
term
under
the
legal
law
of
the
u
s
the
post
do
not
have
to
deal
with
the
teamster
under
the
moral
law
we
should
not
deal
with
them
and
as
a
practical
matter
we
would
be
sap
to
do
so
the
washington
post
be
not
go
to
do
any
business
with
the
teamster
why
it
obviously
isn
t
because
we
re
against
union
we
have
have
contract
for
year
with
or
so
different
union
all
of
them
honest
union
and
he
go
on
to
spell
out
the
crookedness
of
the
teamster
conclude
by
say
that
we
have
the
best
circulation
organization
in
the
country
and
that
we
be
go
to
keep
improve
it
and
expand
opportunity
for
the
dealer
he
say
we
be
not
go
to
let
you
down
by
have
any
dealing
with
that
crowd
and
i
be
counting
on
each
one
of
you
not
to
let
us
down
and
they
didn
t
know
how
thing
work
i
assume
people
around
phil
may
have
try
to
tell
him
all
the
reason
why
he
couldn
t
make
such
a
speech
it
might
not
be
legal
today
and
i
m
not
sure
it
be
then
but
it
be
a
significant
example
of
his
ability
to
know
when
to
run
a
risk
to
make
a
vital
point
the
star
s
go
with
the
teamster
prove
to
be
a
crucial
mistake
to
the
independent
post
distributor
sell
one
more
newspaper
meant
more
money
in
his
or
later
her
pocket
to
the
star
s
teamster
driver
sell
one
more
paper
just
meant
more
work
to
be
do
preserve
our
own
delivery
system
turn
out
to
be
an
important
move
for
the
future
health
of
the
paper
and
as
later
amend
it
become
a
system
widely
copy
by
other
paper
by
the
summer
of
phil
be
clearly
exhaust
and
in
need
of
rest
together
we
make
the
decision
to
retreat
to
glen
welby
it
be
an
idyllic
summer
spent
play
with
the
child
and
just
do
nothing
as
phil
described
himself
in
a
letter
to
his
father
in
late
august
he
have
become
practically
a
total
refugee
from
work
he
add
i
think
i
be
quite
a
burden
to
kay
but
i
suppose
that
be
the
normal
role
of
a
husband
only
later
do
it
become
clear
that
by
then
something
serious
be
the
matter
with
him
it
certainly
wasn
t
apparent
to
me
then
what
be
obvious
be
that
he
be
high
strung
and
have
overextend
himself
look
back
i
see
that
he
be
like
a
rocket
fizzle
out
still
give
off
spark
and
even
occasional
burst
of
flame
but
steadily
burning
down
the
big
interruption
to
the
pastoral
life
on
the
farm
that
summer
come
at
the
begin
of
august
when
lyndon
johnson
ask
phil
to
come
back
to
washington
to
help
him
win
passage
of
what
become
the
civil
right
act
of
for
more
than
eighty
year
no
civil
right
act
have
pass
congress
president
eisenhower
write
in
his
memoir
he
have
try
to
make
some
modest
progress
the
year
before
with
a
bill
that
pass
the
house
and
die
in
the
senate
where
lyndon
johnson
have
help
kill
it
in
june
the
same
legislation
pass
the
house
with
a
wider
margin
of
republican
than
democrat
support
it
on
july
the
senate
agree
to
take
up
the
house
bill
the
follow
day
the
senate
amend
the
bill
weaken
it
with
a
jury
trial
amendment
that
lbj
have
add
to
the
bill
to
satisfy
georgia
senator
richard
russell
and
prevent
a
filibuster
since
jury
be
still
all
white
in
the
south
this
be
an
obvious
water
down
of
the
bill
s
strength
however
besides
voting
right
the
bill
provide
for
a
civil
right
commission
and
a
new
assistant
secretary
to
head
a
civil
right
division
in
the
department
of
justice
all
of
this
be
in
line
with
phil
s
plan
for
lbj
to
take
the
lead
in
this
field
as
a
southerner
lyndon
couldn
t
go
as
fast
or
as
far
as
phil
may
have
want
him
to
but
give
his
legislative
skill
and
strength
he
could
move
the
country
forward
from
the
point
of
view
of
many
political
observer
what
lbj
do
be
to
take
everything
out
of
the
bill
except
the
right
to
vote
phil
s
argument
be
that
the
only
thing
that
really
count
about
the
bill
be
the
right
to
vote
phil
s
involvement
in
the
whole
matter
besides
push
lyndon
on
its
importance
from
the
begin
of
their
relationship
begin
in
earnest
in
july
when
he
invite
joe
rauh
to
the
farm
phil
s
invitation
often
come
in
the
form
of
command
and
this
be
one
he
need
joe
s
help
because
joe
have
a
solid
relationship
with
the
black
leadership
in
the
country
especially
roy
wilkins
then
executive
secretary
in
effect
leader
of
the
naacp
and
because
joe
be
a
liberal
influence
in
general
make
what
he
thought
about
the
civil
right
bill
particularly
important
phil
also
ask
joe
to
bring
felix
frankfurter
along
joe
later
recall
that
he
didn
t
divine
any
ulterior
motive
in
the
invitation
and
certainly
didn
t
connect
it
with
the
pending
civil
right
legislation
however
as
he
and
his
wife
olie
and
felix
drove
to
the
farm
he
begin
to
suspect
he
be
about
to
be
work
on
all
the
way
out
felix
be
try
to
persuade
him
of
the
overwhelm
importance
of
voting
right
both
phil
and
felix
do
indeed
work
on
joe
throughout
our
dinner
suggest
that
he
be
ask
for
too
much
in
want
all
the
other
item
on
the
civil
right
agenda
at
that
time
e
g
real
and
rapid
integration
and
enforcement
of
school
desegregation
the
argument
by
which
phil
and
felix
stood
be
that
the
most
important
first
step
for
the
s
be
the
right
to
vote
now
i
can
see
how
extraordinary
and
out
of
order
it
be
for
a
supreme
court
justice
to
be
step
over
the
boundary
to
this
extent
but
i
didn
t
then
it
be
very
much
in
felix
s
nature
and
he
be
deal
with
two
men
phil
and
joe
to
whom
he
be
as
close
as
though
they
be
his
son
and
clearly
he
thought
it
be
important
to
help
phil
persuade
joe
that
the
bill
be
the
best
they
could
get
and
therefore
that
he
should
support
it
sometime
after
the
brainwashing
party
johnson
urge
phil
to
come
up
to
washington
to
be
at
his
side
during
the
final
push
for
passage
of
the
bill
so
phil
return
to
washington
somewhat
to
my
concern
and
stayed
with
lyndon
almost
constantly
for
several
day
work
day
and
night
a
large
part
of
his
role
i
believe
be
to
keep
in
touch
with
joe
and
the
liberal
civil
right
group
with
which
joe
be
connect
the
stick
point
be
the
jury
trial
amendment
negotiation
between
and
among
the
various
group
lobbying
for
and
against
the
bill
center
largely
on
what
would
happen
to
this
amendment
enlist
the
help
of
notable
lawyer
and
legal
mind
phil
work
on
try
to
find
a
formula
that
would
be
acceptable
to
all
party
in
order
to
get
the
vote
to
final
passage
in
the
end
civil
right
activist
may
have
lose
on
the
jury
trial
fight
but
they
gain
a
bill
joe
and
his
like
mind
friend
bought
phil
s
argument
that
this
bill
be
well
than
nothing
roy
wilkins
agree
and
call
a
meeting
of
the
leadership
conference
of
civil
right
which
debate
for
an
entire
day
wilkins
write
in
his
memoir
joe
argue
for
the
bill
on
ground
that
after
year
the
time
have
finally
come
for
a
civil
right
bill
even
a
water
down
bill
and
that
once
congress
have
lose
its
virginity
on
civil
right
it
would
go
on
to
make
up
for
what
have
be
lose
support
the
bill
be
the
hardest
decision
of
his
life
wilkins
write
in
retrospect
he
knew
it
be
the
right
decision
he
recall
hubert
humphrey
say
to
him
in
the
middle
of
the
struggle
roy
if
there
s
one
thing
i
have
learn
in
politics
it
s
never
to
turn
your
back
on
a
crumb
this
be
superb
politics
for
lyndon
johnson
lyndon
be
still
a
texas
senator
who
have
to
get
reelect
and
the
one
thing
they
wouldn
t
be
mad
at
him
for
in
texas
be
voting
right
so
the
whole
strategy
of
go
for
voting
right
be
inspire
the
idea
for
which
phil
be
the
architect
lady
bird
johnson
in
recall
those
day
described
phil
and
lbj
together
as
a
sort
of
bridge
between
two
very
set
in
their
way
bloc
of
people
phil
could
talk
to
both
group
but
lyndon
couldn
t
talk
very
successfully
to
ardent
liberal
he
would
talk
lady
bird
say
but
they
would
not
believe
lyndon
write
phil
the
day
after
passage
say
you
step
into
the
breach
at
the
critical
hour
that
be
something
that
i
will
never
forget
and
i
wish
there
be
some
way
of
tell
the
country
that
your
contribution
to
an
effective
enforceable
bill
be
decisive
phil
use
the
opportunity
to
press
his
point
with
lyndon
about
the
importance
of
look
to
his
political
future
he
argue
that
lyndon
shouldn
t
have
overt
design
on
the
presidency
your
present
attitude
strike
me
as
just
right
anyone
who
work
up
noticeable
and
passionate
design
on
that
particular
office
harm
himself
in
two
way
he
begin
to
lose
control
of
his
own
judgment
he
also
give
aid
and
comfort
to
the
political
enemy
so
just
sit
he
advise
don
t
deny
or
confirm
or
even
conjecture
three
year
be
a
long
long
time
all
rush
and
pant
should
be
left
to
fellow
from
tennessee
and
massachusetts
refer
to
kefauver
and
kennedy
the
effort
phil
make
to
push
the
civil
right
bill
for
johnson
be
enormous
particularly
come
at
a
time
when
he
knew
how
exhaust
he
be
perhaps
if
the
turmoil
have
end
there
he
might
have
be
able
to
rest
again
at
glen
welby
and
get
his
strength
back
instead
just
a
month
later
arkansas
governor
orval
faubus
order
the
national
guard
to
bar
nine
negro
student
from
the
previously
all
white
central
high
school
in
little
rock
the
next
step
in
the
battle
for
civil
right
be
on
since
eisenhower
be
not
very
interested
except
in
theory
and
be
concentrate
on
his
vacation
golf
game
there
be
a
vacuum
within
the
administration
on
the
day
that
press
secretary
jim
hagerty
announce
from
newport
that
the
president
thought
patience
be
what
be
need
the
arkansas
gazette
receive
from
a
wirephoto
service
a
picture
of
the
president
lie
down
on
a
put
green
line
up
a
putt
they
played
the
story
on
page
one
and
put
a
caption
on
the
picture
study
in
patience
into
this
vacuum
in
washington
phil
move
swiftly
and
with
great
assurance
he
be
determine
to
solve
the
problem
to
get
the
child
admit
to
the
school
peacefully
to
get
faubus
to
back
down
and
above
all
to
prevent
the
federal
government
from
have
to
send
in
troop
it
be
of
course
highly
unlikely
as
a
concept
essentially
he
hop
to
take
over
the
government
and
pull
the
string
of
policy
at
heart
phil
still
felt
a
strong
empathy
with
the
south
he
believe
devoutly
in
school
desegregation
but
he
also
understood
how
hard
it
would
be
to
accomplish
in
the
face
of
southern
resistance
so
he
inject
himself
into
the
situation
with
frenzy
as
well
as
with
conviction
believe
that
he
knew
enough
of
the
key

so
that

touch
with
the

however
the
act
that
end
the
immediate
crisis
the
send
in
of
the
troop
be
a
crush
blow
for
phil
he
saw
it
as
a
defeat
not
only
for
the
south
but
for
himself
personally
phil
s
activity
in
regard
to
little
rock
be
the
first
sign
for
me
that
something
be
wrong
with
him
that
his
powerful
talent
could
be
use
in
such
an
idealistic
but
confuse
and
irrational
way
his
health
already
frail
be
affected
physically
and
mentally
he
held
on
to
his
activity
and
his
balance
for
only
another
month
after
little
rock
before
his
first
major
depression
set
in
on
october
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
broke
there
be
no
other
way
to
express
it
all
of
the
latent
physical
and
psychological
symptom
come
to
such
a
sudden
crisis
that
i
didn
t
even
connect
them
in
my
mind
he
be
rack
with
pain
and
in
despair
in
a
total
and
overwhelm
depression
he
wept
and
wept
and
couldn
t
stop
he
say
that
he
felt
trap
no
longer
able
to
go
on
that
everything
be
black
we
be
both
up
all
night
with
me
try
desperately
but
to
no
avail
to
be
of
some
reassure
help
to
convince
him
everything
would
be
all
right
there
be
little
i
could
do
except
stay
close
to
him
we
discover
that
a
hot
bath
help
so
he
take
several
during
the
night
in
an
effort
to
stem
the
tear
and
alleviate
the
desperation
early
in
the
morning
i
call
my
brother
in
baltimore
who
be
at
that
time
a
psychiatrist
on
the
staff
of
john
hopkins
hospital
describe
what
have
happen
and
ask
him
what
we
should
do
he
give
me
the
name
of
someone
at
the
national
institute
of
mental
health
who
could
see
phil
for
analysis
of
what
be
wrong
and
in
turn
recommend
a
psychiatrist
it
be
a
relief
to
both
of
us
to
have
some
plan
of
action
with
the
hope
of
someone
to
lean
on
in
this
ghastly
and
incomprehensible
crisis
phil
saw
this
doctor
for
a
time
or
two
after
which
he
be
sent
to
dr
leslie
farber
with
whom
he
begin
a
long
bizarre
relationship
that
in
the
end
do
more
harm
than
good
i
have
no
idea
what
have
happen
and
didn
t
recognize
what
i
be
witness
i
couldn
t
put
a
name
to
it
and
didn
t
for
a
very
long
time
to
come
i
only
knew
that
phil
have
have
what
seem
like
an
intense
and
complete
nervous
breakdown
which
i
thought
have
be
brought
on
by
all
the
activity
in
which
he
have
be
engage
climaxed
by
little
rock
the
activity
day
and
night
and
the
ensue
disappointment
it
be
all
kept
very
private
our
one
idea
be
to
conceal
what
have
happen
not
only
from
the
world
but
from
our
friend
my
family
and
even
our
child
for
some
reason
beyond
my
initial
phone
call
i
never
even
talk
to
my
brother
about
what
be
the
matter
or
what
have
brought
on
the
crisis
as
a
result
i
have
no
one
on
whom
to
lean
for
advice
and
just
concentrate
on
try
to
be
of
help
to
phil
still
despite
my
lack
of
knowledge
about
his
illness
and
all
the
unknown
i
believe
that
we
d
get
through
this
that
with
enough
rest
he
d
recover
and
we
d
go
on
phil
i
thought
with
all
his
self
assurance
his
glamour
his
good
humor
his
brilliance
his
wit
and
sagacity
would
surely
recover
his
good
health
and
thing
would
return
to
normal
there
be
no
need
to
share
the
temporary
problem
with
the
world
and
every
reason
to
conceal
it
chapter
fourteen
most
of
the
year
follow
phil
s
breakdown
be
spent
in
slow
gradual
recovery
he
have
all
the
symptom
of
severe
depression
overwhelm
doubt
about
himself
and
his
ability
a
desire
to
seclude
himself
from
the
world
and
from
people
a
deep
uncertainty
that
lead
to
indecision
even
about
which
pair
of
shoe
to
wear
guilt
about
whatever
he
felt
he
have
do
wrong
and
even
occasional
talk
of
suicide
we
escape
to
glen
welby
whenever
possible
frequently
just
the
two
of
us
without
the
child
since
sometimes
even
dinner
with
them
be
too
much
for
him
these
long
visit
to
glen
welby
be
hard
on
me
because
i
be
his
only
support
system
there
be
one
period
of
about
six
month
in
which
he
be
so
depressed
he
couldn
t
be
alone
we
hadn
t
be
out
at
all
nor
have
i
left
the
house
except
when
he
visit
his
psychiatrist
at
his
most
depressed
he
be
completely
dependent
on
me
almost
like
a
child
i
be
on
duty
a
great
deal
of
the
time
for
long
talk
about
what
he
be
think
i
confess
i
felt
the
need
to
escape
at
time
to
lead
a
normal
life
again
to
see
friend
but
be
with
someone
in
this
kind
of
severe
depression
be
compelling
and
though
it
be
grueling
there
be
also
something
strengthen
in
be
need
that
much
in
be
able
to
help
him
by
talk
about
whatever
be
on
his
mind
or
sometimes
whatever
i
could
think
of
with
which
to
try
to
reach
him
gradually
i
learn
to
say
whatever
help
him
to
hear
the
experience
literally
taught
me
how
to
talk
if
i
have
any
strength
later
much
of
it
come
from
survive
these
exhaust
month
what
phil
mostly
do
be
go
to
his
psychiatrist
read
and
think
about
the
basic
issue
that
someone
in
severe
depression
tends
to
reflect
on
the
doctor
to
whom
he
be
sent
leslie
farber
be
heavily
into
existential
psychology
inspire
by
dr
rollo
may
an
originator
of
the
humanistic
psychology
school
one
thing
farber
do
be
to
start
phil
and
therefore
me
reading
existentialist
philosophy
and
in
my
case
dostoyevsky
for
whom
i
have
always
have
an
affinity
farber
himself
be
work
on
a
study
of
the
importance
of
will
in
life
it
be
he
who
instill
in
phil
a
distrust
fear
and
horror
of
any
drug
not
to
mention
shock
therapy
claim
that
these
treatment
reduce
people
to
something
less
than
human
something
tranquilize
and
fishlike
in
addition
farber
believe
that
label
something
give
a
name
to
a
disorder
change
how
the
patient
view
himself
and
be
view
by
those
around
him
because
of
this
he
never
put
a
name
to
phil
s
illness
i
didn
t
hear
the
term
manic
depression
until
some
year
later
throughout
this
period
i
view
what
be
happen
with
confusion
and
very
little
understand
farber
be
not
a
strong
individual
phil
by
force
of
his
personality
seem
to
have
take
charge
the
minute
he
walk
into
farber
s
office
when
he
told
farber
he
wasn
t
charge
enough
and
that
he
phil
would
pay
more
farber
let
him
do
so
from
then
on
even
in
his
most
depressed
moment
phil
seem
the
dominant
figure
in
that
relationship
every
rule
of
psychiatry
be
broken
farber
become
a
personal
friend
of
phil
s
write
him
letter
come
to
visit
us
at
r
street
and
glen
welby
give
phil
some
of
his
research
and
writing
to
edit
and
comment
on
even
at
one
time
suggest
we
visit
him
in
italy
where
we
could
all
drink
together
not
something
i
want
to
encourage
in
phil
after
each
of
his
session
with
farber
phil
would
come
home
and
essentially
repeat
all
that
have
be
say
seem
to
hold
nothing
back
although
i
suppose
he
must
have
be
more
selective
than
i
realize
these
recappings
have
the
effect
for
me
of
indirect
participation
in
his
therapy
at
the
same
time
i
be
try
to
keep
the
child
s
life
as
normal
as
possible
and
the
outside
world
unsuspecting
as
a
result
of
all
this
i
come
close
to
the
break
point
myself
toward
the
end
of
january
three
month
after
the
onset
of
phil
s
depression
i
found
the
weight
on
me
more
than
i
could
bear
until
one
morning
i
felt
almost
physically
paralyze
but
like
many
people
i
be
unable
to
admit
i
need
help
and
thought
there
might
be
something
weak
or
wrong
about
someone
not
in
extremis
look
to
psychiatry
for
help
phil
discuss
all
this
with
dr
farber
and
between
them
they
arrive
at
the
bizarre
solution
that
i
too
should
begin
see
him
they
suggest
this
as
a
way
of
keep
thing
secure
and
cohesive
but
it
be
certainly
unusual
for
both
phil
and
me
to
be
see
the
same
doctor
never
do
farber
suggest
that
this
might
not
be
a
good
idea
incredibly
there
be
one
point
in
the
next
few
year
when
i
be
go
to
him
often
and
phil
be
not
see
him
at
all
i
once
ask
farber
if
i
have
to
keep
constantly
at
phil
s
side
if
i
could
take
a
break
from
a
weekend
at
glen
welby
to
which
he
respond
that
i
absolutely
must
keep
it
up
i
need
and
be
grateful
for
a
guide
hand
at
that
time
and
farber
undoubtedly
help
to
some
extent
but
this
three
way
conversation
be
very
complicate
and
i
didn
t
know
enough
to
suggest
a
different
program
or
to
seek
one
out
for
nearly
a
year
phil
go
to
the
office
hardly
at
all
occasionally
for
a
meeting
or
two
or
for
lunch
he
cancel
almost
all
meeting
and
public
event
and
never
make
a
speech
although
toward
the
end
of
that
first
year
he
participate
in
a
panel
of
father
and
son
for
donald
s
class
at
st
albans
he
played
golf
with
different
partner
at
burning
tree
several
time
a
week
he
spent
every
weekend
and
sometimes
weekday
at
glen
welby
if
he
travel
it
be
mostly
by
train
since
airplane
disturbed
him
in
his
depressed
mood
we
go
out
to
dinner
only
selectively
mostly
with
one
or
two
people
sometimes
but
rarely
to
large
more
social
dinner
go
out
at
all
be
risky
for
he
often
drank
too
much
and
use
unacceptable
language
phil
s
position
at
the
paper
and
in
the
company
be
such
that
people
could
understand
his
lead
this
kind
of
life
many
post
people
knew
that
he
be
stretch
thin
and
take
a
rest
but
no
one
knew
exactly
what
have
happen
partly
because
of
his
ability
to
cover
up
and
partly
because
of
my
help
in
explain
away
his
absence
and
conceal
his
excess
phil
himself
be
unsure
of
what
he
be
deal
with
month
after
the
breakdown
in
his
correspondence
explain
his
lack
of
activity
he
say
i
have
be
take
a
sort
of
sabbatical
after
several
dos
of
flu
and
an
accumulation
of
exhaustion
and
that
he
have
have
a
winter
of
boringly
bad
health
in
one
letter
he
say
he
have
pledge
to
my
wife
to
limit
my
engagement
in
the
near
future
so
that

of
rosy

several
month

these
year
of
his
illness
coincide
with
a
period
when
major
achievement
at
the
paper
already

luckily
too
there
be
a
strong
national
boom
in
both
general
business
and

that
year
which

as
it

not
as
extreme
as
those
that
hit
later
he

he
have
several
siege
of
normal
sickness
as
well
bout
of
flu

at

with
her
specific
idea
on

i
send

another
reason
in
her
analysis
of
underdeveloped
area
in

i
think
she
have
great
wisdom
about
a
major
problem
of
our
immediate
future
i
know
of
almost
no
one
in
the
first
world
who
be
then
think
about
the
third
world
and
the
importance
of
development
during
this
period
we
be
see
much
less
of
my
parent
but
we
still
give
the
post
s
twenty
fifth
purchase
anniversary
party
at
glen
welby
in
the
summer
of
mainly
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
the
restons
and
phil
met
with
scotty
separately
for
long
talk
during
which
he
again
make
a
pitch
to
scotty
to
come
to
the
post
and
again
get
reject
despite
be
as
close
a
friend
as
phil
have
scotty
disapprove
of
phil
s
active
involvement
in
issue
on
which
the
paper
report
and
his
use
of
the
paper
to
far
his
own
political
goal
it
be
during
this
period
that
phil
get
to
know
edward
bennett
williams
the
famous
criminal
trial
lawyer
he
and
williams
have
met
in
the
early
summer
of
while
williams
be
defend
jimmy
hoffa
the
powerhouse
of
the
teamster
who
be
accuse
of
bribing
one
of
senator
john
mcclellan
s
staff
phil
be
rivet
by
the
hoffa
case
which
he
thought
be
hopeless
and
unwinnable
ed
later
recall
that
first
meeting
vividly
we
begin
to
talk
and
we
have
an
instant
rapport
sometimes
your
chemistry
flow
and
you
have
an
instant
relationship
with
someone
you
really
understand
one
another
you
can
almost
talk
in
shorthand
i
be
intend
to
go
home
to
work
because
i
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
for
the
next
day
but
he
come
home
with
me
and
we
talk
almost
all
night
long
by
the
end
of
six
hour
i
felt
i
knew
as
much
about
phil
and
he
knew
as
much
about
me
as
there
be
so
we
follow
up
on
our
friendship
the
instant
friendship
and
then
i
realize
not
too
long
after
we
met
that
he
have
period
of
depression
and
he
told
me
there
would
be
time
when
he
just
couldn
t
get
up
in
the
morning
he
told
me
one
thing
very
early
in
our
relationship
you
know
if
you
ever
don
t
want
to
get
up
if
you
want
to
pull
back
the
sheet
and
drape
and
not
let
the
sun
in
you
ve
get
to
force
yourself
you
ve
just
get
to
force
yourself
you
ve
get
to
drive
yourself
to
go
open
those
drape
and
let
the
daylight
in
you
cannot
stay
in
that
room
like
all
people
who
be
in
that
kind
of
depression
they
don
t
know
why
they
be
in
depression
my
feel
always
be
that
he
be
terribly
troubled
by
a
self
doubt
whether
he
could
have
be
as
successful
as
he
be
if
he
hadn
t
married
you
in
other
word
whether
or
not
he
would
have
hit
the
height
that
he
do
professionally
if
he
hadn
t
be
kay
graham
s
husband
eugene
meyer
s
son
in
law
and
hadn
t
have
the
post
stock
give
to
him
whether
he
would
have
make
it
as
just
phil
graham
out
of
harvard
law
school
with
great
grade
felix
frankfurter
s
law
clerk
i
use
to
say
to
him
how
in
the
hell
can
you
have
doubt
when
you
be
felix
frankfurter
s
clerk
just
to
be
a
supreme
court
clerk
meant
that
in
those
day
you
be
probably
one
of
the
eighteen
best
law
student
in
america
and
out
of
the
best
law
school
in
america
with
an
academic
record
at
the
very
top
of
that
school
it
be
inevitable
that
he
be
go
to
be
a
top
flight
success
but
that
doubt
drove
him
absolutely
banana
phil
told
me
in
great
detail
all
about
his
meeting
with
ed
but
he
didn
t
bring
him
home
i
remember
meeting
ed
and
his
first
wife
dorothy
but
a
joint
friendship
didn
t
develop
then
the
relationship
be
between
the
two
men
ed
and
i
become
warm
friend
only
much
later
phil
told
me
about
his
first
meeting
with
dorothy
who
have
be
born
with
a
deform
arm
upon
meeting
her
phil
do
one
of
those
breathtaking
thing
which
come
to
him
so
naturally
he
say
hi
kid
what
s
the
matter
with
your
wing
she
apparently
love
the
honest
benign
curiosity
compare
with
the
way
many
people
ignore
her
arm
or
look
the
other
way
so
despite
his
continue
lethargy
phil
engage
in
various
minor
activity
make
his
usual
impact
he
arrange
for
a
car
to
be
give
to
walter
lippmann
for
his
seventieth
birthday
which
lippmann
immediately
trade
for
one
he
prefer
he
confer
with
lyndon
johnson
convincing
him
to
push
the
d
c
home
rule
bill
for
which
we
have
both
work
for
so
long
he
spoke
to
post
meeting
of
stockholder
and
employee
these
little
incursion
into
the
world
be
definite
step
forward
and
it
s
hard
to
reconcile
them
with
the
way
he
be
still
feel
except
for
farber
i
spoke
to
no
one
about
phil
or
what
be
wrong
and
this
be
eat
me
up
phil
like
me
to
be
there
when
he
come
home
from
see
farber
so
i
always
arrange
to
be
at
home
for
him
at
those
time
what
i
do
otherwise
perhaps
as
part
of
our
cover
up
of
the
real
situation
be
to
step
up
my
involvement
in
welfare
work
i
kept
meeting
with
all
the
organization
with
which
i
be
involve
the
child
s
school
the
board
and
so
on
and
enter
a
more
interest
phase
of
my
work
with
the
department
of
public
welfare
involve
an
in
depth
study
of
how
to
get
child
out
of
the
district
s
dickensian
dump
ground
junior
village
although
i
be
try
hard
i
certainly
didn
t
understand
phil
or
respond
to
his
need
well
enough
during
this
time
i
don
t
know
now
and
certainly
didn
t
then
how
much
pressure
he
felt
because
of
his
son
in
law
status
at
the
post
it
s
possible
that
he
really
want
out
of
our
marriage
but
felt
he
couldn
t
get
out
because
of
the
paper
but
by
the
time
i
might
have
acknowledge
that
his
illness
be
so
evident
that
it
be
impossible
to
sort
out
what
be
driven
by
the
illness
and
what
be
his
underlie
feeling
throughout
these
first
year
of
his
illness
phil
remain
the
dominant
figure
by
far
in
the
family
yet
i
have
some
say
i
be
the
foundation
the
stability
i
can
t
remember
exactly
when
he
suggest
just
pick
up
take
the
child
out
of
school
and
living
abroad
for
a
while
but
it
must
have
be
around
the
begin
of
i
thought
this
idea
be
much
too
out
of
the
ordinary
to
leave
his
job
uproot
the
child
put
everyone
in
french
school
it
all
seem
unthinkable
be
he
right
i
m
not
sure
but
i
know
i
wasn
t
able
to
face
the
idea
at
the
time
actually
it
may
have
be
a
good
idea
and
be
certainly
typical
of
his
inventive
zest
for
life
he
be
undoubtedly
feel
pressure
from
which
he
want
to
escape
and
we
might
all
have
profit
from
it
in
the
summer
of
after
month
of
go
slow
phil
write
to
his
father
i
be
begin
to
feel
quite
a
bit
well
but
it
have
be
a
slow
process
i
still
get
tire
more
than
i
like
and
i
guess
i
will
have
to
continue
at
reduce
speed
for
a
few
more
month
if
it
be
not
for
that
i
would
grab
a
plane
and
fly
down
for
a
visit
actually
at
this
point
phil
be
even
less
connect
to
his
own
family
than
he
be
to
mine
but
he
be
still
explain
his
absence
as
a
need
to
lie
low
for
a
while
and
get
his
strength
back
by
the
summer
and
fall
of
phil
be
start
to
do
a
little
more
but
only
a
little
yet
his
business
instinct
continued
to
function
at
a
high
level
he
be
in
negotiation
that
continued
over
a
long
period
to
buy
the
greensboro
news
and
record
in
north
carolina
the
town
s
only
newspaper
and
the
owner
of
greensboro
s
only
tv
station
wfmy
a
cbs
affiliate
at
a
cost
of
million
the
deal
finally
fell
through
because
of
the
reluctance
of
a
member
of
the
family
who
own
the
paper
but
phil
have
nurse
it
along
for
month
he
then
devote
the
same
energy
to
planning
new
building
at
already
exist
property
one
for
wjxt
in
jacksonville
and
the
other
a
million
addition
to
the
post
building
to
be
complete
in
meanwhile
my
own
life
evolve
to
accommodate
phil
s
change
one
and
the
change
need
of
my
four
child
and
my
age
parent
mother
call
us
a
great
deal
and
have
her
way
of
let
us
know
if
we
hadn
t
be
attentive
enough
she
would
hint
about
how
much
she
d
see
of
her
other
child
e
g
ruthie
be
so
wonderful
she
call
every
day
or
make
not
so
subtle
statement
about
how
thoughtful
bi
have
be
my
visit
to
her
remain
mostly
one
side
actually
after
this
be
helpful
to
me
it
be
easy
to
keep
from
her
phil
s
illness
or
how
i
felt
about
it
since
she
rarely
ask
about
me
and
didn
t
take
time
to
listen
when
she
do
ask
like
phil
she
have
frequent
bout
of
cold
flu
or
even
pneumonia
she
stayed
in
bed
most
of
one
winter
i
suspect
there
be
some
depression
along
with
whatever
ail
her
and
drank
pretty
continually
too
then
just
as
phil
begin
to
get
a
little
well
my
father
begin
to
deteriorate
add
to
my
deep
concern
in
his
early
eighty
he
be
decline
sharply
he
be
also
increasingly
a
problem
for
my
mother
who
look
to
phil
and
me
to
help
her
with
him
she
be
have
a
hard
time
concentrate
on
her
work
because
he
be
often
in
a
dark
and
difficult
mood
and
she
pour
out
her
heart
in
a
letter
to
me
say
that
more
and
more
she
be
anxious
over
dad
s
state
of
mind
and
she
thought
we
ought
to
know
how
precariously
he
be
poise
between
stability
and
neurosis
she
continued
i
actually
get
frighten
about
the
future
when
he
be
strong
i
could
fight
back
that
be
out
of
the
question
now
he
conquers
through
weakness
and
i
be
helpless
the
only
people
who
can
help
me
therefore
be
you
and
let
s
admit
it
especially
phil
who
can
say
anything
because
he
be
the
one
person
who
can
do
no
wrong
for
the
next
two
year
as
she
struggle
with
dad
s
increase
debility
she
rely
on
us
especially
me
more
than
ever
keep
up
her
trip
and
leave
us
in
charge
of
him
one
day
i
be
surprised
to
read
an
interview
with
her
in
a
new
york
paper
in
which
she
discuss
the
role
of
woman
about
how
a
woman
could
have
her
own
work
but
always
have
to
take
care
of
her
husband
first
she
actually
say
that
before
she
left
on
trip
she
always
arrange
to
have
my
father
kept
busy
and
kept
company
the
arrangement
of
course
consist
of
call
me
and
ask
me
to
lay
on
bridge
game
and
companion
since
i
be
extremely
busy
by
this
time
and
have
no
secretary
which
she
do
not
to
mention
be
consume
by
phil
s
illness
i
be
indignant
as
mother
become
even
more
absorbed
in
her
work
and
in
herself
we
become
my
father
s
mainstay
and
he
too
become
increasingly
reliant
on
phil
and
me
he
would
come
over
in
search
of
company
and
occasionally
lean
on
us
about
his
problem
often
complain
about
my
mother
s
drinking
when
his
adore
old
sister
rosalie
stern
die
we
told
him
the
news
he
be
devastate
and
broke
into
tear
after
phil
s
breakdown
it
become
harder
for
me
to
be
there
for
my
father
always
in
protect
phil
i
unfortunately
never
share
with
my
father
or
anyone
else
what
be
wrong
i
wasn
t
embarrass
it
be
just
something
very
private
something
we
both
still
assume
he
d
get
over
and
there
be
the
stigma
of
mental
illness
phil
once
say
to
don
this
mean
i
can
never
be
in
the
cabinet
dad
must
have
be
puzzle
and
worried
by
phil
s
health
but
luckily
he
die
before
thing
with
phil
come
to
a
crisis
he
be
so
devote
to
phil
that
it
would
have
be
an
unbearable
blow
for
him
i
believe
there
be
three
main
people
on
whom
my
father
have
bestow
his
love
and
affection
and
respect
his
brother
edgar
and
his
partner
gerald
henderson
both
of
whom
die
young
and
phil
my
father
s
feeling
for
me
be
very
strong
but
i
couldn
t
fill
the
role
any
of
those
three
played
in
his
life
phil
reciprocate
his
feeling
and
show
it
in
almost
all
of
their
encounter
and
relation
he
express
them
in
a
birthday
letter
he
write
to
my
father
a
few
day
after
his
breakdown
i
can
imagine
how
much
strength
he
would
have
need
to
summon
up
just
to
put
pen
to
paper
i
have
no
aversion
to
friend
and
in
fact
i
have
a
group
which
while
not
multitudinous
be
more
of
a
host
than
i
need
or
deserve
of
all
these
i
want
to
say
that
none
be
as
close
or
as
integral
as
you
early
in
phil
and
i
decide
to
take
the
child
to
europe
for
a
couple
of
month
during
the
summer
lally
would
be
sixteen
and
don
fourteen
and
we
thought
it
be
about
the
last
time
we
could
take
these
old
two
on
a
sightsee
tour
one
day
that
spring
i
have
see
my
father
cough
up
blood
after
which
he
shook
his
head
and
say
to
me
not
good
i
didn
t
then
know
exactly
what
he
meant
but
he
must
have
know
it
suggest
a
tumor
on
his
lung
his
condition
affected
me
deeply
for
i
realize
he
must
be
slowly
die
it
be
utterly
shatter
and
left
me
with
a
gnawing
grief
and
constant
anxiety
i
be
terribly
torn
about
leave
him
at
that
time
and
still
don
t
understand
why
i
do
the
trip
have
seem
like
a
good
idea
in
the
planning
and
i
didn
t
have
much
will
of
my
own
it
be
hard
to
foresee
how
long
my
father
s
decline
might
go
on
but
his
doctor
felt
that
his
condition
be
pretty
stable
and
that
the
decline
probably
would
be
slow
but
steady
concede
of
course
a
surprise
always
possible
even
my
mother
put
her
imprimatur
on
my
go
by
write
me
do
not
worry
about
me
dad
be
so
patient
so
philosophical
that
it
be
exalt
to
be
with
him
when
adlai
be
here
and
felt
sad
for
me
i
say
firmly
i
be
not
to
be
pity
i
be
to
be
envy
that
s
the
way
thing
be
darling
throw
yourself
into
every
experience
know
that
all
will
be
for
the
best
over
here
i
be
somewhat
reassure
when
phil
stayed
behind
to
finish
some
business
and
to
be
with
dad
phil
take
us
to
new
york
and
the
four
child
and
i
set
off
for
paris
on
june
i
thought
about
my
father
all
the
time
particularly
when
i
receive
a
letter
from
mother
say
that
my
brother
bill
s
son
would
be
bicycling
in
france
and
add
so
the
third
generation
spread
its
wing
just
as
the
man
who
unknown
to
them
have
provide
them
with
security
be
get
ready
to
fold
his
wing
forever
despite
my
remorse
about
not
be
home
the
whole
time
we
be
in
europe
i
felt
i
have
be
transport
to
another
world
as
i
write
phil
i
feel
so
remote
that
i
can
t
even
in
my
imagination
get
back
to
crescent
place
r
street
phil
at
home
be
attend
to
my
parent
need
relieve
mother
of
some
of
the
tension
of
visit
dad
at
the
hospital
where
he
have
go
when
he
have
take
a
turn
for
the
bad
phil
report
on
one
lunch
he
have
with
my
mother
that
remind
me
of
some
of
your
experience
to
keep
it
go
i
mention
lally
s
ask
me
about
zen
buddhism
wham
it
turn
out
that
definitive
seminal
etc
discussion
of
this
be
in
aggie
s
chinese
art
book
thought
you
d
be
glad
to
know
one
letter
phil
write
to
me
from
glen
welby
in
that
interlude
before
he
join
us
in
europe
still
give
me
profound
pleasure
and
comfort
what
follow
in
the
next
several
year
all
the
illness
and
chaos
and
heartache
left
me
so
confuse
about
what
phil
truly
felt
that
i
like
to
think
it
be
this
letter
from
the
distant
past
that
reflect
his
true
feeling
it
be
write
at
a
moment
when
the
depression
be
subside
and
he
seem
to
be
near
a
balance
when
the
old
phil
emerge
again
the
one
i
knew
and
love
this
be
such
a
curious
curious
place
alone
all
place
be
but
this
most
and
r
st
next
a
couple
of
hour
ago
i
thought
of
j
alsop
on
that
sunday
afternoon
in
our
house
just
a
week
ago
and
his
say
about
his
loss
of
not
have
a
family
then
i
give
it
no
credence
that
be
none
of
the
heart
and
to
the
mind
only
that
sort
of
loss
doesn
t
seem
so
much
when
the
heart
get
work
along
with
the
mind
then
that
be
when
you
imagine
which
be
why
imagination
be
probably
one
of
the
big
human
capacity
it
s
not
all
clear
to
me
how
much
j
alsop
feel
the
loss
but
it
be
certainly
clear
that
no
one
can
feel
a
loss
who
hasn
t
first
have
a
family
as
much
as
the
feel
get
to
be
to
one
who
have
loss
be
a
pretty
inaccurate
blown
up
word
for
a
few
day
absence
absence
doesn
t
come
close
to
what
i
m
think
what
be
i
think
reminder
i
believe
be
the
point
a
home
to
reverse
the
madam
s
phrase
be
not
a
house
but
a
great
big
store
of
memory
and
if
that
be
why
a
home
be
good
it
be
also
why
a
home
alone
be
almost
unbearable
just
before
sunset
to
take
one
example
the
softing
light
be
end
so
surely
and
so
gently
that
no
one
could
afford
to
ignore
it
to
lose
it
unnoticed
in
a
house
and
also
there
be
our
friend
the
dog
so
i
toss
me
up
a
large
beaker
of
scotch
and
ice
and
whistle
them
up
and
bang
out
the
front
screen
down
the
gate
to
the
dusty
driveway
where
they
head
at
once
toward
lake
k
no
i
call
no
no
and
i
whistle
them
back
we
re
go
up
the
drive
to
the
gate
as
mummy
do
and
we
swung
along
george
all
tire
until
on
the
curve
by
the
woodmill
he
saw
a
rabbit
and
dash
clear
to
the
bridge
with
the
speed
of
wind
unsuccessful
once
again
as
we
near
the
dip
in
the
drive
near
the
bridge
i
could
see
you
heavy
and
sad
the
way
i
saw
you
over
a
year
ago
as
i
stood
down
at
the
barn
and
watch
you
walk
alone
and
heavy
with
care
in
a
similar
dusk
those
care
cause
by
me
can
i
wash
them
away
can
i
tidy
them
up
like
a
month
s
end
bank
account
by
say
ah
but
there
be
my
care
too
heavy
and
also
have
cause
oh
no
my
memory
will
not
go
away
nor
will
it
cancel
out
nor
do
it
bear
me
down
in
the
facile
lament
of
mea
culpa
those
care
you
walk
along
so
heavily
burden
with
they
be
memory
too
part
of
the
long
story
as
i
knew
when
we
reach
the
bridge
and
the
three
of
them
hurl
their
hot
self
through
the
weed
into
the
cool
pool
of
the
run
that
bridge
be
memory
too
a
thousand
memory
and
one
especially
of
a
dark
dark
night
when
i
be
as
dark
as
the
night
be
and
sat
on
that
bridge
and
talk
to
my
good
red
dog
just
beyond
the
bridge
the
edge
of
the
wood
be
bright
with
the
bloom
of
day
lily
and
they
leap
across
the
drive
and
start
again
around
the
foundation
of
the
old
tenant
house
where
they
be
join
by
brilliant
red
hollyhock
and
just
then
three
separate
quail
call
from
the
quiet
of
the
wood
behind
me
and
i
say
to
myself
you
must
remember
every
bit
of
all
you
saw
and
tell
kay

a
big
winner

try
to
run
a
hospital
of
sort
for
him
at
crescent
place
but
as
phil
point
out
she
have
neither
the
temperament
nor
the
competence
for
the
job
everyone
have
convince
her
that
my
father
be
well
off
in
the
hospital
phil
be
certain
we
have
do
the
right
thing
by
carry
on
with
our
trip
despite
some
alarm
the
situation
be
the
same
he
thought
i
e
slow
deterioration
company
be
now
almost
meaningless
to
my
father
and
mother
have
bi
bill
and
ruth
there
to
help
i
felt
with
good
reason
horribly
torn
today
i
can
see
that
the
summer
be
wonderful
for
the
child
but
wrong
for
me
i
can
hardly
bear
to
think
that
i
left
my
father
s
side
when
he
be
die
from
venice
phil
write
a
move
letter
to
my
mother
at
this
morning
i
awaken
think
of
you
and
these
last
week
and
i
decide
i
have
from
now
on
to
call
you
by
your
name
which
i
think
you
will
understand
kay
be
wakeful
too
a
little
later
and
we
talk
of
you
so
warmly
in
the
dark
with
the
morning
canal
noise
just
begin
as
a
background
below
our
window
it
seem
to
me
that
love
come
very
hard
for
you
it
probably
do
for
all
of
us
and
to
most
of
us
never
come
and
never
even
miss
have
always
come
hard
for
you
and
now
it
be
with
you
a
powerful
shake
terrify
beautiful
love
for
that
gallant
old
man
you
say
poor
word
about
have
a
job
to
do
and
be
able
to
stand
anything
and
you
be
right
to
obfuscate
because
the
true
word
be
too
seismic
but
he
know
what
be
in
you
and
it
be
the
fulfillment
of
his
life
his
cup
runneth
over
and
mine
too
in
pang
of
joy
for
both
of
you
we
left
venice
for
a
simple
hotel
at
the
beach
resort
of
forte
dei
marmi
and
there
we
receive
word
that
my
father
have
take
a
real
turn
for
the
bad
and
we
should
return
at
once
phil
and
i
left
the
child
with
the
college
girl
who
be
travel
with
us
and
flew
back
to
new
york
and
on
to
washington
which
take
sixteen
hour
the
thought
of
be
there
at
his
death
disturbed
me
so
deeply
that
i
be
torn
between
want
to
see
him
and
hop
it
have
already
happen
he
die
two
day
after
we
get
back
but
he
knew
i
be
there
people
react
in
such
complicate
way
to
any
death
but
particularly
to
the
death
of
a
parent
because
a
lot
of
what
one
feel
be
about
oneself
and
the
sense
that
nothing
now
stand
between
that
self
and
die
you
have
now
become
the
old
generation
i
believe
that
the
closer
and
more
love
the
relationship
be
the
deeper
but
simpler
the
grief
of
my
father
s
child
my
brother
have
the
hardest
time
with
his
death
perhaps
because
their
relationship
be
difficult
to
begin
with
and
very
ambivalent
through
no
fault
of
either
of
them
they
have
never
be
close
my
mother
be
so
complicate
emotionally
to
begin
with
that
his
death
be
very
hard
for
her
she
have
chafed
under
the
burden
of
his
age
but
when
he
die
she
sank
into
a
deep
depression
it
be
as
if
she
have
be
lean
against
a
door
that
have
suddenly
burst
open
there
be
a
private
service
for
my
father
at
crescent
place
and
a
more
public
memorial
service
at
the
nearby
all
soul
unitarian
church
one
he
have
never
attend
i
suppose
it
be
hard
to
hit
on
an
appropriate
spot
for
a
nonreligious
jew
my
parent
friend
chief
justice
earl
warren
deliver
a
eulogy
which
i
think
be
write
by
sidney
hyman
rudolf
serkin
played
with
his
quartet
the
whole
thing
be
simple
and
move
and
i
couldn
t
believe
he
be
go
a
week
later
we
left
washington
to
return
to
pick
up
the
child
in
rome
in
our
absence
they
have
all
fall
in
love
with
italy
and
the
mad
italian
the
child
be
good
traveler
and
good
sport
about
everything
even
help
with
steve
then
only
seven
by
the
time
we
arrive
in
london
we
be
have
such
a
good
time
that
we
decide
to
prolong
our
stay
by
almost
three
week
and
to
return
by
steamer
the
mauritania
for
me
the
trip
have
be
wonderful
in
its
way
despite
my
grief
and
my
guilty
feeling
about
my
father
which
persist
to
this
day
for
phil
the
trip
be
a
forward
step
in
his
recovery
he
be
considerably
more
active
that
fall
his
activity
be
mostly
related
to
politics
he
step
up
his
connection
with
lyndon
johnson
he
also
accepted
some
invitation
to
speak
to
various
group
an
indication
of
his
near
recovery
or
at
least
his
return
to
some
balance
although
he
hadn
t
spoken
publicly
for
a
long
time
two
speech
he
give
one
at
the
end
of
and
another
in
february
be
vintage
phil
with
the
add
dimension
that
they
be
full
of
thought
on
the
necessity
for
understand
the
meaning
of
one
s
life
in
the
first
to
the
american
electric
power
company
in
canton
ohio
he
spoke
about
the
shake
loneliness
that
a
man
experience
whatever
his
job
whenever
he
face
up
to
the
meaning
of
what
he
be
engage
in
where
i
get
in
difficulty
at
time
almost
unbearable
difficulty
be
when
i
try
to
examine
the
meaning
of
what
i
be
engage
in
when
these
difficulty
get
too
great
we
in
the
newspaper
business
retreat
to
the
ritual
of
recite
old
rule
that
we
know
be
meaningless
we
say
that
we
just
print
the
objective
news
in
our
news
column
and
confine
our
opinion
to
the
editorial
page
yet
we
know
that
while
this
have
some
merit
as
an
over
simplify
slogan
of
good
intention
it
also
have
a
strong
smell
of
pure
baloney
if
we
keep
wage
too
low
in
some
few
area
where
union
still
let
us
do
it
or
if
we
neglect
decent
work
amenity
as
long
as
we
can
avoid
the
cost
we
defend
ourselves
by
mutter
about
our
concern
for
stockholder
as
though
by
announce
compassion
for
a
relatively
anonymous
and
absent
group
we
can
justify
a
lack
of
compassion
for
people
we
spend
our
work
day
with
if
we
be
brutally
careless
about
printing
something
that
maligns
the
character
of
some
concrete
individual
we
be
apt
to
wave
the
abstract
flag
of
freedom
of
speech
in
order
to
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
a
concrete
apology
if
we
be
press
even
harder
we
may
salve
our
conscience
by
say
that
after
all
there
be
libel
law
and
as
soon
as
we
say
that
we
redouble
our
effort
to
make
those
law
as
toothless
as
we
possibly
can
and
if
we
be
press
really
quite
hard
we
can
finally
shrug
our
shoulder
and
say
well
after
all
we
have
to
live
then
we
can
only
hope
no
one
will
ask
the
ultimate
question
why
i
certainly
have
be
guilty
of
all
those
stupid
action
and
a
great
many
more
stupid
and
i
suppose
that
more
than
a
few
of
you
have
do
as
poorly
what
i
prefer
to
recall
be
those
rare
occasion
when
i
have
have
some
well
sense
of
the
meaning
of
what
i
be
engage
in
in
those
moment
i
have
realize
that
our
problem
be
relatively
simple
and
that
some
simple
ancient
moral
precept
be
often
reliable
business
tool
in
those
moment
i
have
be
able
to
keep
in
mind
that
it
really
doesn
t
matter
whether
i
be
kept
in
my
job
in
those
moment
i
have
be
able
to
look
straight
at
the
frailty
of
my
judgment
and
finally
i
have
be
honest
enough
to
recognize
that
a
few
a
very
few
great
issue
about
the
meaning
of
life
be
the
only
issue
which
deserve
to
be
consider
truly
complex
by
pay
attention
to
the
broader
meaning
of
what
we
be
engage
in
we
may
be
able
to
join
our
passion
to
our
intelligence
and
such
a
juncture
even
on
the
part
of
but
one
individual
can
represent
a
significant
step
forward
on
the
long
road
toward
civilization
the
whole
political
year
of
be
very
excite
there
be
a
thrill
to
know
someone
of
your
generation
who
run
for
and
actually
becomes
president
by
the
late
s
we
have
gotten
to
know
jack
kennedy
early
in
he
have
be
one
of
four
speaker
at
the
post
sponsor
book
and
author
luncheon
on
hand
as
the
author
of
profile
in
courage
accord
to
a
post
article
reporting
on
the
luncheon
the
young
senator
delighted
a
largely
feminine
audience
by
quip
i
always
use
to
wonder
what
the
lady
do
in
washington
in
the
daytime
senator
kennedy
be
one
of
the
people
we
knew
much
well
than
we
normally
would
have
because
of
joe
alsop
who
have
decide
very
rapidly
that
he
be
all
for
kennedy
phil
and
i
have
see
the
kennedy
at
big
party
look
glamorous
and
handsome
but
i
never
take
him
seriously
i
remember
exclaim
to
joe
when
he
say
sometime
around
that
he
thought
kennedy
would
be
president
one
day
joe
surely
you
re
not
serious
you
don
t
really
think
kennedy
could
be
president
do
you
joe
say
darling
i
think
he
will
certainly
be
nominate
and
quite
probably
be
elect
the
kennedy
have
recently
move
into
a
house
on
n
street
in
georgetown
and
in
the
late
fall
of
or
early
winter
of
joe
invite
us
to
dinner
with
them
phil
have
too
much
to
drink
and
be
visibly
and
audibly
out
of
control
i
be
embarrass
probably
too
much
so
but
impressed
with
kennedy
for
his
cool
approach
which
ignore
it
totally
and
treat
phil
as
though
he
be
perfectly
sober
i
admire
that
and
be
grateful
after
the
other
guest
left
we
and
the
kennedy
urge
by
joe
stayed
on
phil
look
kennedy
straight
in
the
eye
and
say
jack
you
be
very
good
you
will
be
president
someday
but
you
be
too
young
and
you
shouldn
t
run
yet
to
which
kennedy
reply
well
phil
i
m
run
and
this
be
why
first
i
think
i
m
as
well
qualify
as
anybody
who
be
go
to
run
except
for
lyndon
johnson
second
if
i
don
t
run
whoever
win
will
be
there
for
eight
year
and
will
influence
who
his
successor
will
be
and
third
if
i
don
t
run
i
ll
have
to
stay
in
the
senate
at
least
eight
more
year
as
a
potential
candidate
in
the
senate
i
ll
have
to
vote
politically
and
i
ll
end
up
as
both
a
mediocre
senator
and
a
lousy
candidate
i
be
thoroughly
impressed
by
this
and
each
time
i
saw
senator
kennedy
i
grow
more
impressed
we
also
get
to
know
jack
and
jackie
well
through
bill
walton
their
painter
friend
and
ours
one
night
we
go
to
a
dinner
at
bill
s
with
the
kennedy
also
there
be
france
ann
hersey

acquaintance
of

from
madeira

by
then
the

writer
john

france

the
wealthy

manufacturer
in
the
south
she
have
have
a
romance
with
jack
in
college
he
have
apparently
propose
to
her
and
she
have
turn
him
down
or
so
she
told
bill
somehow
jack
have
gotten
back
his
love
letter
and
jackie
have
read
them
so
when
bill
call
jackie
and
suggest
this
dinner
she
respond
oh

i
would
rather
meet
her
than
any
other
woman
in
the
world
bill
enlist
our
help
as
neutral
party
we
accepted
and
arrive
with
great
anticipation
particularly
because
phil
hadn
t
then
spent
many
hour
with
jack
in
such
a
small
group
bill
later

talk
solidly
all
even
as
bill

they
be
both
at
their

and
it
be
a
really
important
even
for
both
of
them
and
jackie
be
in
heaven
because
she

on
january
kennedy
formally
announce
his
decision
to
seek
the
presidency
johnson
declare
only
a
few
day
before
the
convention
what
a
difference
between
that
and
the
current
process
the
post
at
the
time
of
kennedy
s
announcement
editorialize
that
he
have
a
tenacity
of
purpose
and
maturity
of
judgment
an
acute
awareness
of
the
great
issue
of
the
day
by
now
phil
be
much
well
though
he
still
have
moment
of
depression
and
at
least
two
period
that
year
of
health
problem
follow
by
two
week
vacation
or
getaway
that
allow
him
to
rest
he
be
in
balance
but
only
precariously
he
be
on
the
edge
of
a
manic
period
that
built
with
his
grow
and
still
constructive
involvement
in
the
political
dynamic
of
that
crucial
year
of
very
early
on
phil
predict
that
kennedy
and
johnson
would
be
the
only
candidate
to
come
into
the
democratic
convention
with
sizable
bloc
of
delegate
five
hundred
for
kennedy
and
three
hundred
for
johnson
he
thought
he
have
vision
of
kennedy
s
not
make
it
and
adlai
stevenson
s
emerge
as
the
compromise
northern
candidate
in
june
kennedy
as
have
nixon
before
him
come
to
an
editorial
lunch
at
the
post
at
that
point
he
have
enter
and
run
in
seven
primary
include
the
roughest
in
west
virginia
where
only
percent
of
the
population
be
catholic
i
recall
jackie
say
later
that
caroline
s
first
word
be
west
virginia
kennedy
have
clearly
demonstrate
he
be
a
vote
getter
much
of
the
luncheon
talk
concerned
nixon
who
be
regard
as
the
almost
certain
republican
nominee
eddie
folliard
still
the
post
s
key
political
reporter
ask
kennedy
if
he
would
debate
nixon
on
television
if
it
turn
out
that
both
of
them
be
their
party
nominee
for
the
presidency
kennedy
say
he
would
remind
of
nixon
s
reputation
as
a
debater
kennedy
calmly
add
i
think
i
can
take
him
ask
about
the
possibility
of
lyndon
johnson
as
vice
president
kennedy
scoffed
at
the
idea
say
he
felt
sure
johnson
wouldn
t
accept
it
rus
wiggins
disagreed
feel
that
johnson
would
like
to
broaden
his
horizon
as
vice
president
although
the
interview
be
off
the
record
both
these
exchange
about
the
debate
and
about
the
potential
run
mate
be
of
great
help
to
those
cover
the
convention
and
the
rest
of
the
campaign
these
day
all
such
interview
be
do
on
the
record
and
therefore
take
on
an
entirely
different
significance
and
be
sometimes
i
think
less
helpful
on
july
johnson
held
a
press
conference
at
which
he
announce
his
candidacy
phil
who
have
be
help
him
prepare
for
this
moment
for
month
be
at
his
side
work
on
his
statement
he
end
up
on
his
hand
and
knee
crawl
around
at
the
last
minute
to
retrieve
one
of
lyndon
s
contact
lens
which
have
popped
out
the
announcement
get
make
and
johnson
go
to
new
york
to
meet
with
the
press
and
do
all
the
ritual
thing
phil
and
i
flew
to
california
early
five
day
before
the
democratic
convention
be
to
open
on
july
i
be
already
commit
to
kennedy
phil
remain
loyal
to
johnson
until
he
lose
the
bid
for
the
nomination
but
he
be
entirely
realistic
and
he
too
admire
jfk
my
mother
a
year
after
my
father
s
death
be
begin
to
come
out
of
her
depression
like
the
rest
of
us
she
have
gear
up
for
politics
in
this
election
year
and
arrive
in
los
angeles
still
staunchly
support
adlai
stevenson
who
as
usual
have
decline
to
be
a
candidate
but
be
eligible
for
a
draft
on
friday
july
johnson
arrive
the
first
of
the
candidate
almost
immediately
he
confide
to
his
office
staff
it
s
all
over
with
it
s
go
to
be
kennedy
by
a
landslide
only
kennedy
have
a
sophisticated
organization
already
in
place
in
los
angeles
it
be
the
first
time
we
saw
electronic
communication
between
people
work
in
different
place
talk
to
each
other
through
hand
held
intercom
and
beeper
now
so
routine
it
be
very
impressive
phil
call
on
bobby
kennedy
and
get
from
him
confidential
figure
on
his
brother
s
strength
number
that
show
jfk
very
close
to
the
number
of
vote
need
to
win
the
nomination
close
enough
so
that
the
pennsylvania
delegation
or
a
big
chunk
of
it
could
put
him
over
on
monday
pennsylvania
caucus
and
announce
that
the
state
delegation
would
give
sixty
four
of
its
eighty
one
vote
to
kennedy
which
make
phil
and
the
post
reporter
write
that
it
would
be
kennedy
on
the
first
ballot
at
that
point
phil
get
together
with
joe
alsop
to
discus
the
merit
of
lyndon
johnson
as
kennedy
s
run
mate
joe
persuade
phil
to
accompany
him
to
urge
kennedy
to
offer
the
vice
presidency
to
johnson
joe
have
all
the
secret
password
and
the
two
men
get
through
to
evelyn
lincoln
kennedy
s
secretary
in
a
room
next
to
his
dreary
double
bedroom
and
living
room
they
take
a
seat
on
one
of
the
bed
and
nervously
talk
out
who
would
say
what
while
they
observe
what
joe
term
the
antechamber
of
history
joe
decide
he
would
introduce
the
subject
and
phil
should
make
the
pitch
when
they
be
then
take
to
the
living
room
to
see
jfk
joe
open
with
we
ve
come
to
talk
to
you
about
the
vice
presidency
something
may
happen
to
you
and
symington
be
far
too
shallow
a
puddle
for
the
united
state
to
dive
into
furthermore
what
be
you
go
to
do
about
lyndon
johnson
he
s
much
too
big
a
man
to
leave
up
in
the
senate
then
phil
spoke
shrewdly
and
eloquently
accord
to
joe
point
out
all
the
obvious
thing
that
johnson
could
add
to
the
ticket
and
note
that
not
have
johnson
on
the
ticket
would
certainly
be
trouble
kennedy
immediately
agree
so
immediately
as
to
leave
me
doubt
the
easy
triumph
phil
note
in
a
memo
afterwards
so
i
restate
the
matter
urge
him
not
to
count
on
johnson
s
turn
it
down
but
to
offer
the
vpship
so
persuasively
as
to
win
johnson
over
kennedy
be
decisive
in
say
that
be
his
intention
point
out
that
johnson
could
help
not
only
in
the
south
but
elsewhere
in
the
country
phil
told
the
post
s
reporter
they
could
write
that
the
word
in
l
a
be
that
kennedy
will
offer
the
vice
presidency
to

and
then
go
on
and
win
everything
s
wonderful
phil
described
this
soap
opera
thrust
as
somehow
wonderfully
appropriate
and
write
that
bill
moyers
echoed
loud
approval
while
swing
open
the
hall
door
and
push
johnson
out
into
the
tv
light
and
the
explosion
of
flash
bulb
phil
watch
lyndon
and
lady
bird
stand
on
chair
their
face
metamorphose
into
enthusiasm
and
confidence
at
that
point
as
word
spread
of
johnson
s
acceptance
the
area
fill
with
people
and
phil
flee
to
meet
up
with
me
in
the
post
s
office
phil
write
all
of
this
in
a
memo
for
his
own
file
he
kept
it
confidential
until
three
year
later
when
he
let
teddy
white
borrow
it
when
he
be
work
on
the
book
the
make
of
the
president
for
the
campaign
to
my
surprise
white
print
the
whole
memorandum
as
an
appendix
to
that
book
which
i
felt
phil
would
not
have
want
when
it
be
publish
bobby
be
extremely
angry
and
say
that
it
wasn
t
accurate
that
phil
didn
t
know
the
whole
story
what
be
wrong
with
it
i
ask
he
reply
my
brother
and
i
be
never
apart
even
later
after
lbj
be
president
and
the
strain
between
him
and
bobby
have
grown
great
i
be
sit
next
to
bobby
at
dinner
at
my
house
when
i
mention
that
i
have
see
president
johnson
at
his
request
just
before
the
dinner
and
i
note
that
that
be
odd
since
johnson
wasn
t
really
speak
to
me
what
do
you
mean
he
s
not
speak
to
you
bobby
ask
when
phil
make
him
president
i
thought
you
told
me
phil
s
memo
be
inaccurate
i
respond
incredulous
it
be
bobby
reply
but
because
of
what
phil
didn
t
know
his
role
be
more
important
not
less
i
ask
him
to
tell
me
what
he
meant
but
he
would
only
say
that
he
would
someday
unfortunately
he
never
get
the
chance
the
explanation
however
can
be
infer
from
various
book
especially
arthur
schlesinger
s
on
bobby
there
be
no
doubt
in
my
mind
from
reading
these
book
and
from
think
back
that
neither
jack
nor
bobby
kennedy
really
want
johnson
on
the
ticket
after
vacillate
for
three
or
four
hour
the
kennedy
accord
to
bobby
come
upon
this
idea
of
try
to
get
rid
of
him
and
it
didn
t
work
when
johnson
surprised
the
kennedy
by
accept
the
pro
forma
invitation
jack
sent
bobby
down
to
persuade
him
to
withdraw
when
jfk
realize
that
bobby
s
mission
wasn
t
go
to
work
he
make
the
disingenuous
remark
that
bobby
be
out
of
touch
even
a
year
later
bobby
say
they
be
all
too
tire
that
day
he
told
john
seigenthaler
an
editor
and
a
friend
we
be
right
at
eight
ten
and
two
and
wrong
at
four
o
clock
whatever
their
real
feeling
as
phil
and
joe
have
predict
they
would
not
have
won
without
johnson
because
there
be
only
about
a
week
between
the
convention
we
have
plan
to
go
from
one

the
other
without

whose
life
she
influence
flo
have
include
us
in
her
tension
with
the
family
and
so
we
have
not
be
in
touch
with
each
other
in
any
but
formal
way
for
year
at

as
grown
ups
by
this
time
flo
have
gotten
very
heavy
but
she
be
still
her
old
self
literate
witty
interest
intelligent
and
sensitive
this
visit
begin
a
relationship
that
continued
in
the
two
year
remain
to
her
and
meant
a
lot
to
both
of
us
the
republican
convention
in
chicago
of
course
be
entirely
different
from
that
of
the
democrat
nixon
be
the
only
candidate
but
nelson
rockefeller
who
have
give
up
the
race
in
december
act
as
a
goad
to

a
profile
of

contrast
jfk
with

of
all
my
activity
in
this
busy
political
year
i
have
undertaken
a
major
renovation
of
our
house
in
georgetown
and
we
have
move
out
in
june
and
take
up
residence
in
my
mother
s
house
on

unbowed
by
the
failure
of
her
draft
stevenson
effort
and
even
though
she
be
never
a
kennedy
devotee
mother
have
embrace
the
democratic
ticket
and
become
a
national
vice
chairman
of
citizen
for
kennedy
and
johnson
she
write
to
kennedy
ask
to
see
him
to
discus
campaign
strategy
in
new
york
state
and
how
she
as
a
protestant
who
have
the
reputation
of
have
be
anti
catholic
could
help
him
fight
the
religious
issue
i
have
become
a
real
kennedy
enthusiast
and
conveyed
my
excitement
for
the
charismatic
candidate
whenever
i
could
even
while
still
in
los
angeles
at
the
convention
i
have
be
swim
with
marian
sulzberger
dryfoos
the
wife
of
orvil
dryfoos
the
publisher
of
the
new
york
time
and
have
told
her
while
both
of
us
stood
waist
deep
in
the
pool
how
i
have
become
impressed
by
kennedy
and
why
i
be
an
ardent
supporter
that
conversation
lead
to
a
dinner
phil
and
i
give
at
my
parent
house
on
august
for
jack
kennedy
to
meet
orvil
as
well
as
to
spend
some
more
time
with
scotty
reston
we
felt
they
be
both
uncertain
about
kennedy
and
we
want
to
let
kennedy
sell
himself
to
the
time
what
still
amazes
me
be
that
kennedy
drove
up
our
circular
driveway
alone
in
a
convertible
with
the
top
down
phil
and
i
have
decide
that
as
publisher
he
couldn
t
contribute
to
the
campaign
but
it
would
be
okay
for
me
to
do
so
we
played
this
game
in
several
other
situation
but
i
now
think
it
be
questionable
since
we
believe
in
nonpartisanship
for
a
publisher
we
be
both
so
concerned
about
the
district
and
its
problem
that
phil
told
me
that
if
there
be
a
chance
to
get
kennedy
alone
before
the
others
come
i
should
give
him
my
check
personally
and
tell
him
there
be
something
i
want
in
return
for
him
to
pay
some
attention
to
the
district
and
its
problem
i
do
as
phil
suggest
and
remember
jfk
look
a
little
startle
when
i
deliver
the
first
part
of
my
speech
about
want
something
although
i
be
embarrass
i
manage
to
get
through
the
second
part
and
he
thanked
me
and
take
the
check
the
whole
atmosphere
in
washington
that
fall
as
well
as
the
real
intensity
of
phil
s
highly
subjective
feeling
about
kennedy
be
best
described
by
him
in
a
letter
to
isaiah
berlin
write
on
october
he
told
isaiah
he
have
time
to
write
because
he
be
lie
at
home
cough
and
gulp
achromycin

the
size
of
the
new

he
write
your
friend
be
in
the
main
rid
an
upward
curve
of
kennedy
enthusiasm
joe
and
i
i
lag
three
month
behind
him
be
beyond
enthusiasm
into
passion
kay
also
have
passion
earlier
arrive
at
than
mine
but
passion
marked
by
an
irritate
feminine
discretion
she
sometimes
see
wart
on
the
nose
or
succumbs
to
momentary
depression
about
his
chance
joe
and
i
float
along
on
an
idolatrous
cloud
blind
to
his
misstep
confident
of
his
triumph
curiously
enough
those
closest
to
our
state
of
mind
be
in
order
of
non
detachment
a
walter
lippmann
b
scotty
reston
felix
be
pro
nixon
almost
or
anyway
dubitante
about
kennedy
because
of
papa
arthur
be
strongly
and
effectively
pro
and
have
publish
a
brilliant
pamphlet
but
be
a
bit
left
out
in
the
direct
campaign
which
be
run
by
ted
sorensen
and
dick
goodwin
an
ff
law
clerk
about
the
last
generation
definitely
now
begin
at
kenneth
galbraith
be
also
not
directly
involve
but
seem
to
mind
it
less
and
also
be
idolatrous
one
have
to
make
big
guess
about
candidate
and
i
remind
myself
my
last
one
be
ike
in
there
s
a
lot
of
pure
sawdust
in
kennedy
s
campaign
cf
fdr
but
there
s
also
style
vigor
and
a
show
of
know
that
this
be
he
be
decisive
when
that
be
the
order
and
wonderfully
vague
and
elusive
when
it
be
not
e
g
will
stevenson
be
secretary
of
state
my
antenna
tell
me
he
be
not
a
cool
cat
not
young
in
a
pejorative
sense
and
not
want
in
hope
and
idealism
my
guess
be
that
he
will
be
wanderingly
eclectic
in
his
early
program
will
often
exasperate
us
of
the
last
generation
and
ultimately
may
be
a
political
leader
of
great
size
the
other
fellow
richard
nixon
have
surprisingly
show
almost
no
style
in
his
moment
of
truth
he
be
so
artfully
and
thoughtfully
synthetic
that
by
now
pose
have
become
his
reality
despite
his
zeal
for
kennedy
and
his
worry
about
nixon
phil
continued
the
paper
s
policy
of
nonendorsement
hindsight
have
convince
him
that
it
would
have
be
wiser
for
an
independent
newspaper
in
the
nation
s
capital
not
to
endorse
even
in
the
republican
nomination
fight
in
the
post
have
comment
on
the
issue
as
they
arose
throughout
the
campaign
and
phil
thought
the
responsibility
remain
to
comment
freely
in
fact
in
our
editorial
left
little
doubt
about
which
candidate
we
thought
preferable
and
in
private
phil
work
hard
to
bring
about
the
result
he
want
in
late
october
he
draft
a
long
statement
for
lyndon
johnson
to
deliver
ask
people
to
rally
behind
jfk
he
also
write
a
speech
for
johnson
to
use
in
texas
to
appeal
to
his
fellow
texan
to
vote
for
kennedy
election
night
come
at
last
joe
alsop
and
i
stayed
in

at

while
phil
come
and
go
from
the
newsroom
floor
the

be
so
close
throughout
the

chal
robert
in
his
history

that
phil
remember
the
paper
s
profound
embarrassment
in
the
truman
election
would
not
let
eddie
folliard
who
be
write
the
lead
story
call
the

for
a
few
thousand
lousy

when
the
final

the
three
of
us
move
to
joe
s
house
where
the

cooked
us
scramble

at
about
a
m
later
when

may
have

morning
phil
and
i
retreat
to
crescent
place
it
be
late
in
the
morning
before
we
be
reassure
that
kennedy
have
indeed
won
the
deal
that
phil
have
engineer
in
los
angeles
at
the
convention
have
help
bring
about
the
election
of
our
friend
as
the
next
president
of
the
united
state
and
another
even
closer
friend
as
his
vice
president
to
calm
down
from
the
excitement
of
the
kennedy
victory
phil
and
i
spent
two
week
in
phoenix
at
the
arizona
biltmore
when
we
return
home
phil
go
directly
back
to
politick
except
for
weekend
which
we
still
try
to
spend
at
glen
welby
with
the
child
he
be
immerse
in
politics
in
fact
he
facetiously
turn
down
one
invitation
by
say
we
go
to
the
country
with
the
child
every
possible
weekend
as
an
aid
to
such
limited
sanity
as
i
posse
right
after
the
election
he
start
talk
to
and
write
the
presidentelect
about
appointment
to
the
new
administration
both
phil
and
joe
alsop
thought
kennedy
ought
to
appoint
our
friend
douglas
dillon
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
dillon
be
a
liberal
republican
who
have
serve
as
undersecretary
of
state
in
the
eisenhower
administration
and
have
contribute
to
the
nixon
campaign
so
this
didn
t
seem
like
a
strong
possibility
arthur
schlesinger
and
ken
galbraith
have
dinner
with
us
one
even
and
as
arthur
note
in
his
book
a
thousand
day
we
be
distressed
by
phil
s
impassioned
insistence
that
douglas
dillon
should
and
would
be
make
secretary
of
the
treasury
without
know
dillon
we
mistrust
him
on
principle
as
a
presume
exponent
of
republican
economic
policy
but
as
arthur
also
write
when
i
mention
this
to
the
presidentelect
in
washington
on
december
he
remark
of
dillon
oh
i
don
t
care
about
those
thing
all
i
want
to
know
be
be
he
able
and
will
he
go
along
with
the
program
what
a
refresh
thought
if
only
more
president
felt
that
way
in
fact
the
presidentelect
call
joe
about
the
liberal
want
albert
gore
father
of
the
clinton
administration
vice
president
al
gore
for
the
position
but
he
told
joe
that
he
want
dillon
joe
recall
kennedy
say
they
say
that
if
i
take
doug
dillon
he
won
t
be
loyal
because
he
s
a
republican
joe
respond
that
it
would
be
very
hard
to
imagine
a
man
less
likely
to
be
disloyal
than
dillon
he
also
add
and
if
you
take
albert
gore
you
know
perfectly
well
a
he
s
incompetent
b
you
ll
never
be
able
to
hear
yourself
think
he
talk
so
much
c
when
he
isn
t
talk
your
ear
off
he
ll
be
tell
the
new
york
time
all
i
m
sure
this
whole
conversation
with
kennedy
be
recall
in
alsopian
term
but
i
m
also
sure
that
some
such
conversation
do
indeed
take
place
kennedy
agree
with
phil
and
joe
about
dillon
and
say
he
want
to
get
the
message
to
doug
joe
told
kennedy
that
the
man
to
do
that
be
phil
not
himself
so
phil
call
doug
who
be
give
a
dinner
and
say
he
need
to
see
him
not
wish
to
be
observe
by
the
dinner
guest
phil
crawl
in
through
a
dress
room
window
which
have
be
left
open
for
him
the
butler
call
doug
out
of
the
din
room
and
phil
and
dillon
have
a
conversation
right
there
in
the
dress
room
during
which
doug
assure
phil
that
he
would
love
to
be
secretary
and
that
he
would
most
certainly
be
loyal
phil
and
joe
also
recommend
david
bruce
for
secretary
of
state
advice
that
the
president
didn
t
take
later
phil
effect
david
s
be
sent
as
ambassador
to
london
not
rome
which
kennedy
have
promise
david
be
so
modest
that
he
hadn
t
told
jfk
he
would
actually
prefer
london
phil
realize
the
situation
thought
david
would
be
just
right
for
london
and
go
to
jfk
to
tell
him
so
david
be
name
ambassador
and
stayed
all
eight
year
of
the
kennedy
johnson
administration
he
and
evangeline
be
an
enormous
success
in
london
and
david
turn
out
to
be
one
of
jfk
s
favorite
particularly
since
he
not
only
kept
the
president

with
what

do
you
tell
him
he
couldn
t
use
the
story
there
be
a
long
silence
salinger
later
recount
in
his
own
book
before
kennedy
chuckle
and
reply
no
i
guess
i
didn
t
the
begin
of
the
new
administration
be
an
excite
and
very
busy
time
for
us
for
phil
and
me
personally
the
big
moment
be
suppose
to
come
on
the
afternoon
of
the
inaugural
gala
january
in
the
tradition
of
my
family
we
have
plan
a
large
reception
at
our
r
street
house
back
into
which
we
have
just
move
phil
have
write
presidentelect
kennedy
to
invite
him
personally
remind
him
that
he
and
jackie
have
come
to
the
inaugural
reception
in
january
and
hop
he
would
drop
by
this
time
unless
you
be
dissatisfied
with
your
progress
in
the
past
four
year
both
the
president
and
the
vice
president
elect
have
promise
to
come
although
jackie
recently
have
have
her
second
baby
john
have
write
that
she
be
save
every
bit
of
strength
to
get
through
the
two
day
of
official
activity
on
the
early
afternoon
of
the
reception
an
icy
snow
start
to
fall
and
quickly
render
washington
s
street
so
perilous
that
car
slid
all
over
the
place
and
traffic
become
gridlocked
some
people
take
hour
to
get
home
others
give
up
and
take
shelter
it
be
an
unprecedented
mess
the
secret
service
descend
on
us
and
held
out
the
promise
that
either
kennedy
or
johnson
or
both
would
still
manage
to
get
to
our
house
but
we
could
see
by
the
snowdrift
and
by
the
few
guest
who
have
manage
to
trudge
through
the
blizzard
that
this
be
not
likely
finally
we
be
told
it
be
hopeless
even
with
an
escort
car
couldn
t
move
and
the
city
and
the
secret
service
be
do
everything
they
could
to
get
the
presidentelect
and
jackie
to
the
gala
that
night
so
instead
of
a
big
party
for
six
hundred
people
who
would
drop
by
for
a
while
and
then
leave
we
have
about
two
hundred
who
get
to
our
house
mostly
on
foot
and
wouldn
t
leave
a
jolly
gathering
of
a
different
sort
the
next
day
the
street
be
mostly
clear
but
it
be
bitter
cold
we
go
to
the
swear
in
and
be
amuse
by
cardinal
cushing
s
long
blessing
during
which
the
podium
seem
to
start
to
smoke
because
of
some
wiring
problem
along
with
so
many
others
we
be
thrill
by
the
inaugural
speech
which
have
mostly
be

a
certain
way
i
become
anxious
have

a
lot
with
the
inevitably
difficult
and
contentious
result
but
mac
bundy
the
ex
dean

harvard
and
new

turn
around
from

through
the
mccardles

mutter
here
you
nixon
love
son
of
a
bitch
at
the
ball
the
kennedy
look
very
handsome
and
regal
because
joe
have
ask
afdera
fonda
the
beautiful
italian
wife
of
henry
fonda
and
flo
smith
an
old
kennedy
friend
from
palm
beach
to
come
by
his
house
for
a
drink
he
decide
to
go
home
early
and
try
to
get
phil
and
me
to
leave
with
him
but
by
then
phil
be
have
much
too
good
a
time
so
joe
found
peter
duchin
who
be
also
leave
get
a
ride
with
him
through
the
still
snowy
street
and
arrive
in
time
to
welcome
his
guest
they
lit
a
fire
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
it
and
quietly
reflect
on
the
momentous
day
flo
and
afdera
however
have
spread
word
of
the
after
ball
party
and
their
friend
start
to
arrive
eventually
we
drove
home
from
the
dance
with
the
bohlens
and
the
bradens
and
as
our
car
pass
dumbarton
avenue
we
look
down
toward
joe
s
and
notice
that
the
street
be
lit
up
block
off
and
full
of
police
avis
say
either
joe
s
house
be
on
fire
or
the
president
s
there
indeed
he
be
we
felt
sad
not
to
have
left
with
joe
and
share
in
the
excite
moment
when
he
heard
a
quiet
knock
open
the
door
and
found
the
new
young
president
of
the
united
state
snowflake
in
his
hair
and
a
smile
on
his
handsome
face
wait
to
come
in
chapter
fifteen
even
now
it
s
hard
to
appraise
how
good
a
president
jack
kennedy
be
in
the
relatively
short
time
allow
him
in
office
but
it
s
not
hard
to
recall
the
excitement
and
hope
generate
by
a
president
who
be
vibrant
young
eloquent
and
commit
to
solve
old
problem
in
new
way
especially
in
the
begin
we
be
electrify
by
the
prospect
of
this
administration
phil
and
i
have
be
much
closer
to
johnson
than
to
kennedy
but
phil
especially
grow
close
to
kennedy
as
time
go
on
theirs
be
an
easy
relationship
at
dinner
one
night
at
joe
alsop
s
phil
typically
be
offering
political
advice
when
kennedy
tease
phil
when
you
get
elect
dogcatcher
i
will
listen
to
you
on
politics
many
of
kennedy
s
appointee
be
or
become
and
remain
our
friend
among
them
douglas
dillon
and
arthur
schlesinger
who
serve
the
president
as
special
assistant
and
adviser
on
latin
american
and
cultural
affair
and
as
his
resident
court
philosopher
our
old
friend
ken
galbraith
be
ambassador
to
india
but
because
he
be
closer
to
kennedy
on
economic
matter
than
be
many
others
he
commute
frequently
from
india
to
washington
for
consultation
with
the
president
kennedy
once
say
to
him
i
don
t
want
to
hear
about
agriculture
from
anybody
but
you
ken
and
i
don
t
want
to
hear
about
it
from
you
either
robert
mcnamara
whom
we
hadn
t
know
come
into
the
administration
as
secretary
of
defense
he
have
be
a
classmate
of
my
cousin
walter
haas
at
the
university
of
california
and
wally
want
me
to
meet
him
right
away
though
ours
be
not
an
immediately
positive
relationship
a
strong
friendship
developed
between
bob
and
margy
and
phil
and
me
a
friendship
that
bob
and
i
continue
to
this
day
bill
walton
be
make
head
of
the
fine
art
commission
in
washington
which
kennedy
thought
be
a
salaried
position
but
which
to
the
president
s
embarrassment
turn
out
not
to
be
bill
have
a
marvelous
time
though
despite
his
force
volunteer
influence
the
design
of
the
city
include
lafayette
square
and
help
jackie
on
matter
of
renovation
and
art
for
the
white
house
part
of
what
contribute
to
the
excitement
of
the
kennedy
presidency
for
us
be
that
these
men
surround
the
president
and
indeed
the
president
himself
be
our
friend
and
for
the
most
part
our
contemporary
we
no
longer
be
the
young
acquaintance
of
the
old
generation
constitute
the
government
with
phil
have
become
publisher
of
the
post
just
before
his
thirty
first
birthday
we
seem
always
to
have
be
the
young
people
in
the
room
now
our
generation
be
run
the
country
as
phil
put
it
at
the
begin
of
a
speech
he
give
at
the
national
war
college
i
have
be
feel
especially
venerable
and
ancient
ever
since
the
moment
on
january
when
i
first
learn
that
it
be
possible
to
be
old
than
the
president
of
the
united
state
by
early
march
phil
be
involve
in
his
old
in
depth
way
with
many
activity
political
and
post
company
related
and
he
seem
to
me
to
be
enjoy
himself
i
can
see
today
that
his
activity
have
become
increasingly
frenetic
though
still
fairly
constructively
so
the
most
obvious
example
of
which
be
his
purchase
of
newsweek
then
a
weak
marginally
profitable
newsmagazine
for
businessmen
far
behind
its
rival
time
the
magazine
newsweek
have
first
appear
in
february
and
in
be
rename
newsweek
have
be
bought
by
vincent
astor
with
averell
harriman
and
a
few
others
as
investor
at
vincent
s
death
the
astor
foundation
control
by
vincent
s
widow
brooke
in
effect
own
the
magazine
and
the
trustee
decide
that
it
should
be
sell
as
early
as
january
one
of
the
men
on
the
post
s
business
staff
have
told
phil
about
the
magazine
s
be
for
sale
and
phil
have
say
he
wasn
t
interested
he
be
then
approach
by
a
management
group
lead
by
malcolm
muir
newsweek
s
chairman
but
phil
again
dismiss
the
idea
then
ken
crawford
a
friend
of
phil
s
and
washington
bureau
chief
for
newsweek
and
ben
bradlee
crawford
s
assistant
begin
egg
him
on
the
idea
must
have
begin
to
take
hold
because
when
ben
call
phil
one
night
at
home
a
call
ben
later
refer
to
as
the
best
telephone
call
i
ever
make
the
lucky
most
productive
most
excite
most
reward
phil
told
him
to
come
right
over
ben
reminisce
later
say
i
use
to
stew
about
it
at
night
and
it
seem
incredible
to
me
that
mature
people
couldn
t
have
some
control
over
their
own
future
that
s
what
prompt
his
call
phil
talk
at
length
with
ben
at
our
house
and
ask
him
to
go
home
and
write
an
extensive
memo
on
why
phil
should
buy
the
magazine
encourage
ben
not
to
worry
about
what
he
say
because
phil
would
be
the
only
one
reading
it
ben
go
home
at
a
m
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
draft
a
long
stream
of
consciousness
memo
unfortunately
lose
which
seem
to
have
be
persuasive
to
phil
a
few
day
later
in
late
february
this
time
in
the
even
at
our
house
phil
met
again
with
ben
who
brought
along
oz
elliott
newsweek
s
thirty
six
year
old
manage
editor
ben
remember
the
instantaneous
rapport
between
phil
and
oz
phil
have
this
way
of
leap
ahead
of
himself
he
would
start
out
a
sentence
switch
and
then
expect
others
to
know
what
he
meant
and
where
he
be
go
elliott
be
on
the
same
wavelength
and
so
they
hit
it
off
very
well
the
next
day
phil
flew
to
new
york
where
he
met
with
the
company
s
lawyer
and
financial
adviser
bring
into
the
situation
fritz
beebe
who
have
help
with
the
purchase
of
the
time
herald
after
fritz
look
favorably
at
the
figure
phil
decide
to
try
to
buy
the
magazine
and
dove
right
in
as
active
negotiation
over
newsweek
increase
to
breakneck
speed
phil
get
terribly
frantic
and
wound
up
the
deal
take
only
about
three
week
from
begin
to
end
during
which
time
he
slept
very
little
and
rode
a
high
crest
work
feverishly
to
get
it
do
the
whole
idea
of
buying
newsweek
and
add
yet
another
huge
responsibility
to
his
already
too
full
plate
make
me
nervous
i
wasn
t
a
regular
reader
of
newsweek
nor
be
phil
at
that
time
and
it
have
no
real
emotional
appeal
for
me
i
knew
the
magazine
be
national
press
and
therefore
have
an
impact
but
i
wasn
t
think
about
the
business
effect
so
much
as
the
potential
personal
and
negative
effect
on
phil
have
be
through
so
much
with
phil
s
depression
i
worried
that
this
would
become
just
another
problem
for
him
to
deal
with
at
a
time
when
he
be
already
overextend
on
the
other
hand
some
of
our
long
talk
over
the
past
few
year
have
make
it
apparent
to
me
that
phil
be
worried
about
be
a
son
in
law
about
have
be
give
the
paper
and
the
company
by
my
father
he
kept
question
whether
this
be
the
reason
for
his
success
and
his
prominence
could
he
have
achieve
what
he
have
on
his
own
he
seem
to
be
brooding
over
this
question
more
and
more
and
by
then
this
have
become
enough
of
an
issue
in
my
mind
that
despite
my
misgiving
i
come
down
on
the
side
of
the
newsweek
purchase
it
so
clearly
be
something
phil
would
have
do
on
his
own
once
he
have
decide
to
go
for
the
magazine
phil
touch
every
base
he
knew
to
influence
the
people
who
would
make
the
decision
on
which
bidder
would
be
the
victor
the
other
finalist
be
the
wealthy
publishing
house
doubleday
he
met
with
allan
betts
the
vice
president
and
treasurer
of
the
astor
foundation
give
him
an
outline
of
the
washington
post
company
s
proposal
for
the
purchase
while
other
potential
purchaser
have
simply
announce
that
they
want
to
buy
the
magazine
phil
take
the
trouble
to
write
down
his
idea
for
its
future
it
happen
that
a
few
of
his
idea
coincide
with
plan
that
vincent
have
make
and
share
with
brooke
so
she
be
especially
keen
on
phil
s
be
the
victorious
bidder
for
her
this
decision
would
be
base
on
more
than
money
she
say
at
the
time
i
want
phil
graham
to
have
it
because
he
s
the
only
person
who
have
write
down
exactly
what
vincent
be
think
about
brooke
astor
be
an
important
voice
in
the
sale
and
she
want
to
be
sure
newsweek
would
end
up
in
responsible
hand
phil
also
go
to
considerable
trouble
to
acquire
averell
harriman
s
support
without
which
betts
later
acknowledge
the
foundation
would
have
refuse
to
let
phil
enter
the
race
for
the
magazine
at
the
last
minute
finally
after
a
weekend
at
glen
welby
phil
left
for
new
york
with
al
friendly
john
sweeterman
and
john
hayes
to
meet
fritz
i
be
suppose
to
go
with
them
but
have
some
thing
to
take
care
of
so
i
suggest
i
come
up
the
follow
day
after
the
flurry
of
departure
i
receive
a
telephone
call
from
my
doctor
who
ask
to
see
me
that
afternoon
this
be
unusual
but
i
be
unsuspecting
i
have
be
to
see
him
the
previous
week
for
a
chronic
cough
and
fatigue
and
as
a
matter
of
course
i
have
have
a
chest
x
ray
since
the
doctor
be
always
look
at
several
heal
scar
on
my
lung
a
not
uncommon
thing
but
this
time
dr
felt
say
to
me
that
he
suspect
i
might
have
tuberculosis
if
i
do
have
it
it
be
in
the
very
early
stage
and
therefore
could
be
dealt
with
but
he
want
me
to
go
to
the
hospital
for
a
week
of
test
i
explain
to
him
that
phil
be
in
the
middle
of
extremely
tense
negotiation
in
new
york
and
that
i
be
suppose
to
join
him
the
follow
day
there
be
no
way
i
could
call
him
with
this
piece
of
news
i
couldn
t
possibly
divert
or
upset
him
with
my
own
problem
at
such
a
moment
believe
that
i
have
to
be
there
for
him
and
support
him
in
this
effort
i
ask
dr
felt
if
we
could
postpone
the
hospital
visit
until
i
get
back
from
new
york
i
realize
that
phil
be
fragile
and
that
i
could
help
bolster
him
dr
felt
knew
phil
well
and
understood
my
predicament
and
say
that
it
be
probably
safe
to
go
as
long
as
i
didn
t
stay
up
late
or
spend
time
in
smoke
fill
room
neither
of
which
i
could
avoid
of
course
his
admonition
go
the
expectable
way
none
of
us
slept
much
and
everyone
around
me
be
smoking
nonstop
i
felt
somewhat
like
a
soap
opera
heroine
but
not
tell
phil
at
the
time
be
the
only
thing
to
do
thing
be
dramatic
and
tense
enough
as
it
be
so
i
sat
in
the
carlyle
suite
with
fritz
and
phil
and
follow
the
negotiation
as
a
close
spectator
watch
as
they
work
together
in
a
perfectly
complementary
way
enthral
by
what
be
go
on
and
caught
up
in
the
excitement
at
one
point
betts
call
to
say
that
although
the
offer
from
the
final
contender
be
more
or
less
equal
we
have
to
come
up
with
more
cash
if
we
want
to
be
competitive
cash
we
didn
t
have
at
first
phil
and
fritz
be
overcome
with
despondency
again
my
mother
get
into
the
picture
call
me
to
tell
phil
to
feel
free
to
spend
her
money
too
if
need
but
instead
phil
get
on
the
phone
and
sell
the
old
time
herald
building
to
the
developer
william
zeckendorf
after
that
he
go
into
one
of
the
bedroom
alone
with
a
yellow
pad
and
a
pencil
for
about
an
hour
play
with
number
to
make
the
purchase
work
out
when
he
emerge
he
say
to
fritz
there
be
three
way
we
might
do
this
fritz
glance
at
his
pad
and
quickly
respond
the
first
two
won
t
work
but
the
third
one
will
the
whole
thing
be
very
courageous
of
phil
and
fritz
we
be
still
a
small
private
company
without
much
cash
especially
after
borrowing
for
all
the
previous
deal
and
for
the
post
and
jacksonville
building
which
we
be
in
the
process
of
either
enlarge
or
rebuild
and
particularly
when
contrast
with
doubleday
which
be
cash
rich
we
be
all
on
pin
and
needle
on
the
day
of
decision
march
ensconce
in
the

nearly
worn
a
path
on

and
forth
with
worry
and
excitement
he
decide
to
take
a
shower
to
relieve
his
agitation
and
naturally
he
be
in
the
shower
when
the
phone
rang
allan

drip
wet
and
barely

by

to

and
say

half
dozen
other

a
high
bid
after
the
deal
be
close
but
the
astor
foundation
honorably
stuck
by
its
word
the
rest
of
that
day
be
take
up
talk
with
the
press
and
phil

go
over
to

t
identify
himself

the
receptionist

apparently
knew
what
be
afoot
but
wasn
t
aware
who
the
victor

so
told
his
son

or
so

with
real
elegance
say
as
you
know
i
ve
be
try
to
raise
the
money
to
buy
the
magazine
myself
and
i
ve
fail
and
in
that
failure
i
can
imagine
nobody
more
appropriate
to
be
the
owner
than
phil
others
be
slightly
more
cautious
many
of
the
staff
know
only
of
the
reputation
of
the
post
as
anti
mccarthy
wonder
who
this
man
be
and
ran
to
the
library
to
study
a
time
cover
story
on
him
that
have
run
in
ben
bradlee
write
me
a
note
shortly
after
these
day
of
frenzied
activity
it
be
so
typical
of
him
in
its
tone
and
stream
of
consciousness
style
that
be
a
nice
day
you
be
funny
the
way
you
jumped
when
the
phone
rang
your
husband
be
funny
too
the
way
he
jumped
when
the
phone
rang
charlie
be
funny
too
the
way
he
jumped
when
the
phone
rang
and
that
nice
mister
sweeterman
boy
be
he
ever
jumpy
it
be
lucky
i
wasn
t
jumpy
or
anything
i
be
never
jumpy
when
someone
be
try
to
buy
thing
it
really
be
very
hard
to
be
jumpy
when
you
be
walk
on
air
the
day
after
our
victory
phil
and
i
take
the
train
back
to
washington
travel
in
one
of
those
small
compartment
in
a
pullman
car
about
halfway
home
i
felt
i
have
to
tell
him
what
be
happen
to
me
and
what
the
doctor
suspect
it
be
a
tremendous
shock
to
him
his
reaction
be
strange
and
should
have
warn
me
about
his
state
of
mind
he
simply
deny
the
possibility
say
it
couldn
t
be
tb
that
be
out
of
the
question
of
course
it
be
a
mistake
he
would
take
care
of
it
etc
etc
nevertheless
i
go
to
the
hospital
the
next
day
and
stayed
there
for
a
week
during
which
time
it
be
confirm
that
i
do
indeed
have
tb
i
wonder
now
about
the
relationship
between
my
illness
and
stress
it
be
very
rare
in
those
day
for
someone
in
an
upper
income
bracket
to
develop
this
disease
maybe
all
the
stress
of
phil
s
illness
have
come
to
be
more
of
a
factor
than
i
realize
the
combination
of
event
his
anxiety
over
the
purchase
and
my
illness
sent
phil
into
a
bad
spin
of
drinking
and
frantic
behavior
of
every
kind
at
one
crucial
moment
in
the
hospital
the
doctor
and
i
wait
to
discus
my
diagnosis
with
him
phil
come
in
and
never
drew
a
breath
talk
incessantly
be
so
witty
and
so
funny
that
we
rock
with
helpless
laughter
and
it
wasn
t
until
he
have
left
the
room
that
we
both
realize
no
serious
word
have
be
spoken
no
difficult
issue
have
be
dealt
with
it
sound
incomprehensible
but
it
be
true
many
people
believe
phil
have
endless
energy
but
a
few
of
the
hundred
of
congratulatory
letter
phil
receive
after
the
newsweek
purchase
express
concern
for
his
health
one
be
from
tommy
tom
who
have
work
for
ernie
graham
for
year
and
have
know
phil
since
he
be
a
little
boy
in
florida
and
even
in
terry
south
dakota
before
that
you
no
doubt
have
be
congratulate
and
toast
by
many
great
and
important
people
on
your
last
adventure
none
more
sincerely
than
by
one
who
have
be
privileged
to
sit
on
the
side
line
and
watch
these
development
since
long
ago
in
terry
when
i
look
back
now
over
the
many
year
of
tremendous
effort
your
father
expend
in
building
his
a
land
empire
which
have
now
wreck
a
fine
physical
specimen
of
a
man
i
cannot
but
be
skeptical
of
such
attainment
i
hope
you
have
learn
over
the
year
which
i
have
not
to
cast
aside
such
responsibility
that
accompany
such
business
as
yours
and
not
follow
the
footstep
of
your
father
and
work
at
it
hour
each
and
every
day
there
be
no
great
wealth
than
health
phil
thought
this
be
one
of
the
nice
letter
he
receive
but
he
slough
off
tommy
s
concern
by
write
just
remember
that
unlike
my
father
and
you
i
sleep
late
in
the
morning
phil
write
my
mother
of
his
excitement
about
newsweek
soberly
add
now
we
go
slow
r
eally
there
be
few
problem
and
lot
of
opportunity
but
easy
do
it
be
the
watchword
yet
despite
his
talk
of
go
slow
and
easy
do
it
phil
speed
up
again
he
write
to
his
friend
harold
andy
anderson
that
buying
newsweek
be
somewhat
like
do
the
four
minute
mile
quick
but
exhaust
yet
for
someone
who
believe
in
the
slow
and
steady
approach
i
find
myself
exhilarate
at
have
make
the
dash
he
immediately
set
to
work
to
get
rid
of
the
deadwood
at
the
magazine
and
start
hire
talent
promote
oz
elliott
from
manage
editor
to
the
top
edit
job
probably
the
most
important
move
phil
make
just
after
the
purchase
be
persuade
fritz
to
leave
his
law
firm
cravath
and
join
him
in
run
the
washington
post
company
as
his
equal
partner
fritz
be
to
remain
in
new
york
oversee
newsweek
but
to
have
a
large
role
in
all
the
company
s
activity
and
business
my
father
have
once
told
phil
that
when
you
be
operating
with
a
full
head
of
steam
and
have
a
lot
of
responsibility
you
ought
to
have
a
partner
not
an
employee
who
be
your
executive
officer
but
a
real
partner
phil
knew
he
have
found
that
real
partner
in
fritz
he
make
him
a
handsome
offer
which
eventually
reward
fritz
well
still
phil
have
to
use
all
his
not
inconsiderable
power
of
persuasion
fritz
have
to
think
long
and
hard
because
he
obviously
be
destine
for
high
thing
at
cravath
in
fact
several
cravath
partner
never
forgave
him
regard
his
defection
as
a
kind
of
betrayal
fritz
s
become
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
company
and
vice
chairman
of
newsweek
be
probably
the
save
grace
for
the
company
in
the
immediate
time
to
come
and
certainly
be
a
key
factor
in
the
survival
of
the
washington
post
company
in
the
decade
after
i
take
over
fritz
be
an
extraordinary
combination
of
quality
above
all
he
be
wise
and
bright
and
have
a
great
legal
mind
always
think
ahead
conceptually
he
be
devote
to
our
family
and
to
the
company
possibly
in
that
order
but
there
s
no
way
of
tell
since
the
two
be
so
intermingle
he
be
editorially
involve
and
the
editor
at
both
the
post
and
newsweek
become
devote
to
him
for
his
part
phil
be
so
elate
that
in
respond
to
a
congratulatory
letter
from
frank
stanton
on
the
post

completely
free

from

while

phil
take
a
renew
interest
in
the

and
attend
to
his
duty
there
and
throughout

again
he
involve
himself
in

astonish
and
point
out
that
jackie
be
pregnant
too
to
which
he
reportedly
respond
that
go
for
her
also
the
effect
on
phil
of
our
visit
be
immediate
and
long
last
shortly
after
this
trip
he
respond
to
kennedy
s
concern
about
the
grim
situation
especially
in
berlin
by
call
in
his
editor
and
reporter
from
both
the
post
and
newsweek
and
impress
on
them
how
kennedy
felt
phil
also
met
at
length
with
ben
bradlee
one
afternoon
join
by
dick
hottelet
of
cbs

larry
collins

for
hour
late
into
the

he
talk
with
tommy
thompson
and
chip
bohlen
both
soviet
expert
and
diplomat
at
chip
s
home
phil
even
suggest
some
piece
about
the
threat
to
berlin
and
the
possibility
of
million
of
life
be
lose
in
a
nuclear
war
we
knew
he
d
be
over
and
get
it
all
from
kennedy
say
chal
robert
who
have
cover
the
vienna
trip
we
knew
he
be
actually
ask
us
to
write
something
to
promote
kennedy
s
policy
which
be
a
legitimate
news
story
but
it
make
us
uncomfortable
i
never
have
a
fall
out
with
phil
in
any
formal
sense
but
i
do
think
he
get
too
much
into
politics
and
the
kennedy
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
summer
to
give
phil
a
rest
and
me
a
change
of
scenery
i
be
influence
by
a
friend
to
return
to
cape
cod
we
rent
two
house
in
a
family
enclave
know
as
the
bailey
apollonic
house
in
cotuit
which
have
a
pier
across
a
small
road
and
a
ladder
down
a
cliff
to
the
beach
the
summer
be
a
difficult
one
by
the
time
we
left
for
cotuit
phil
clearly
have
become
depressed
again
and
be
also
suffer
from
a
very
bad
back
for
the
most
part
because
of
the
way
he
be
feel
we
lead
a
relatively
quiet
life
while
on
the
cape
he
retreat
from
involvement
with
work
and
from
most
social
event
though
he
do
spend
a
certain
amount
of
time
with
the
child
tease
lally
about
her
young
boyfriend
whose
family
be
in
the
arm
business
and
whom
phil
christen
pistol
bunny
mellon
who
have
a
house
nearby
on
the
cape
call
me
one
day
and
say
you
know
the
kennedy
go
around
in
this
boat
and
they
have
the
most
awful
thick
sandwich
and
can
clam
chowder
for
lunch
i
think
it
would
be
nice
to
have
them
to
a
picnic
and
i
d
like
you
and
phil
to
be
there
i
m
sure
she
didn
t
need
us
but
i
be
excite
i
plead
with
phil
to
go
and
he
hesitantly
accepted
we
be
all
wait
on
the
mellon
beach
in
osterville
when
we
saw
the
president
s
boat
approach
with
the
press
boat
follow
jack
and
jackie
jumped
off
and
come
in
to
the
beach
and
take
shelter
from
the
press
boat
which
disappear
after
the
president
have
go
out
of
sight
bunny
have
substitute
steam
clam
and
champagne
for
the
meager
lunch
she
thought
the
kennedy
usually
have
on
their
boat
the
president
chat
with
phil
and
me
about
member
of
the
press
corp
give
pretty
frank
appraisal
but
be
flatter
about
the
post
s
two
reporter
who
cover
the
white
house
eddie
folliard
and
carroll
kilpatrick
at
lunch
we
all
sat
around
at
small
table
the
president
and
bunny
be
alone
at
one
and
it
be
then
that
he
ask
her
whose
skill
at
landscape
gardening
be
legendary
if
she
would
redesign
the
garden
outside
his
office
window
complain
that
people
call
the
place
a
rise
garden
but
there
wasn
t
a
rise
to
be
see
that
in
fact
there
be
nothing
but
crabgrass
sometime
later
when
nothing
have
happen
with
the
garden
and
bunny
be
go
through
a
receive
line
at
the
white
house
the
president
ask
where
be
the
plan
for
my
garden
oh
mr
president
i
ve
be
busy
and
i
ve
be
travel
they
be
in
my
head
but
i
haven
t
have
time
to
get
them
down
on
paper
that
s
the
trouble
with
the
whole
new
frontier
the
president
wryly
comment
bunny
eventually
get
the
garden
do
and
its
beauty
remains
one
thing
phil
do
that
summer
despite
his
condition
be
to
join
the
board
of
the
rand
corporation
an
independent
research
organization
found
after
world
war
ii
to
advise
the
air
force
on
public
policy
issue
particularly
those
involve
national
security
be
on
the
board
put
phil
in
the
position
of
have
yet
another
connection
with
an
organization
closely
related
to
the
government
i
think
it
be
still
marginally
acceptable
for
him
to
participate
because
the
criterion
for
what
publisher
could
and
should
do
be
looser
in
those
day
some
year
later
rand
invite
me
to
become
a
member
but
by
then
i
felt
i
couldn
t
do
it
the
connection
with
the
government
create
too
much
of
a
conflict
for
me
most
of
that
fall
phil
be
still
feel
low
and
like
to
have
me
with
him
as
always

people
be
shock
that
it
be
be
dance
in
the
white
house
there
be
indeed
a
certain
unreality
to
these
evening
to
be
dance
like
that
in
those
historic
and
elegant
room
once
while
phil

aren
t
you
percent
for

well
i
ll

and
phil
say
jackie
it
s
even
well
this
even
to
be
here
i
love
the
first
time
but
i
felt
sort
of
tense
in
her
magical
voice
jackie
interrupt
and
now
you
just
think
it
s
hamburger
heaven
president
kennedy
s
charm
be
powerful
his
intense
concentration
and
gently
tease
humor
and
his
habit
of
vacuum
cleaning
your
brain
to
see
what
you
knew
and
thought
be
irresistible
the
kennedy
men
be
also
unabashed
chauvinist
as
be
the
great
majority
of
men
at
the
time
include
phil
they
like
other
bright
men
and
they
like
girl
but
they
didn
t
really
know
how
to
relate
to
middle
age
woman
in
whom
they
didn
t
have
a
whole
lot
of
interest
this
attitude
make
life
difficult
for
middle
age
wife
especially
and
induced
or
fed
feeling
of
uncertainty
in
many
of
us
in
those
year
though
the
men
be
polite
we
somehow
knew
we
have
no
place
in
their
spectrum
my
ever
present
terror
of
be
boring
often
overwhelmed
me
in
social
situation
with
the
president
and
at
the
white
house
particularly
whenever
i
be
face
to
face
with
the
president
himself
or
one
of
his
main
adviser
and
my
fear
be
a
real
guarantee
of
be
boring
since
it
paralyze
and
silence
me
i
only
felt
secure
when
phil
whom
the
president
like
be
with
me
and
could
do
the
talk
douglas
dillon
s
wife
phyllis
who
i
thought
be
the
height
of
sophistication
confide
to
me
that
she
felt
the
same
way
she
complain
that
she
be
always
left
on
the
sideline
with
rise
kennedy
at
party
in
palm
beach
one
notable
exception
to
the
chauvinist
tradition
be
adlai
stevenson
woman
enjoy
adlai
in
the
end
my
mother
my
daughter
and
i
all

him
clayton
fritchey
once
told
me
a
story
that
help
explain
adlai
s
appeal
and
that
contrast
it
with
what
many
of
us
felt
about
other
men
in
the
kennedy
administration
include
the
president
himself
about
three
week
before
kennedy

united
nation
and
clayton
be
his
deputy

men

together
at
a
party
and
clayton

himself
to

drink
on
the
balcony
overlook

up
behind
him
and
say

t
have
a
chance
to
talk
much
tonight
but
we
ve
get
a
good
subject
in
common
meaning
adlai
the
president
then
told
clayton
he
didn
t
understand
the
hold
adlai
have
over
woman
comment
on
how
much
jackie
like
and
admire
him
and

the
ease
with

dumpy
kind
of
way
what

of
message

comfort
routine
to

phil
still
didn
t
feel
very
confident
and
didn
t
trust
his
instinct
one
day
he
say
he
have
an
idea
but
it
couldn
t
be
a
good
one
because
it
be
his
a
young
otis
chandler
have

add
to
the

for
the
expansion
by
sell
the
combine

to
twenty
five
or
so
other
big
paper

react
favorably
and
phil
and
i
go
out
to
california
to
advance
the
plan
and
the
los
angeles
time

service

launch
successfully
that
year
with
thirty
two
initial

more
than
six
hundred
newspaper
broadcast
station

here

on
july
phil

which
supply
the
post
s
newsprint
the
trip
with
the
bohlens
be
memorable
in
part
because
phil
seem
well
and
in
balance
only
once
during
the
week
do
he
ask
me
to
take
a
walk
and
talk
to
him
because
he
be
a
little
down
he
still
need
help
but
my
main
thought
be
how
marvelous
he
s
well
again
he
s
recover
what
we
didn
t
know
during
the
trip
be
that
chip
have
be
notify
by
president
kennedy
that
he
be
go
to
be
appoint
ambassador
to
france
chip
and
avis
be
extraordinarily
discreet
not
say
a
word
avis
be
reading
camus
la
peste
in
french
which
might
have
tipped
us
off
but
didn
t
we
have
no
sooner
gotten
back
from
canada
than
the
appointment
be
announce
a
few
day
later
we
go
out
on
the
president

for
a
dinner
in
honor
of
the
bohlens
the
guest
be
all
on
the
open
fantail
of
the

when
kennedy

pull
up
there
be
a
largish
circle
of
friend
sit
on
fold
chair
and
the
only
unoccupied
chair
be
one
next
to
me
so
the
president
have
no
choice
but
to
sit
in
it
i
look
at
phil
silently
implore
him
to
come
over
and
help
but
despite
know
of
my
nervousness
at
talk
to
the
president
or
perhaps
because
of
it
he
just
look
at
me
and
smile
sympathetically
my
insecurity
be
exacerbate
by
my
feel
that
the
president
have
be
force
to
sit
next
to
me
nevertheless
we
begin

the
original
family
farm
which
eventually
become
a
community
of
almost
twenty
five
thousand
people
something
very
significant
happen
to
me
while
we
be
in
florida
i
have
be
feel
that
phil
after
five
long
year
be
finally
well
his
depression
seem
go
and
he
be
grow
more
interested
in
work
again
what
baffle
me
be
my
own
mood
my
emotion
seem
to
be
change
from
one
week
to
the
next
i
be
happy
in
canada
when
we
be
with
the
bohlens
but
i
found
myself
in
tear
much
of
the
time
we
be
in
florida
and
have
no
idea
why
it
be
only
later
that
i
realize
it
be
phil
s
sudden
mood
change
that
have
so
affected
me
the
little
walk
we
d
take
in
canada
to
overcome
his
momentary
depression
have
be
the
last
time
he
d
be
calm
it
be
clear
to
me
now
that
the
almost
in
balance
period
be
suddenly
over
and
that
one
of
hyperactivity
with
its
accompany
anger
and
vitriolic
diatribe
be
begin
i
have
since
learn
that
manic
depressive
cycle
when
left
untreated
tend
to
grow
more
severe
and
occur
closer
together
what
i
be
experience
be
a
quicken
and
an
intensify
of
these
cycle
one
thing
he
do
be
begin
to
buy
thing
some
sensible
some
less
so
in
addition
to
part
of
the
bowater
paper
mill
which
he
have
more
or
less
negotiate
while
we
be
on
the
boat
return
from
canada
during
a
shuffleboard
game
with
the
head
of
the
mill
the
first
week
in
august
he
bought
the
monthly
magazine
artnews
the
old
continuously
publish
art
magazine
in
the
world
phil
consider
the
purchase
not
a
big
investment
of
dough
nor
a
big
bother
of
time
and
energy
but
considerable
fun
and
prestige
and
a
reasonable
profit
so
all
very
pleasant
essentially
he
bought
it
for
me
think
i
could
be
involve
with
it
in
some
way
that
would
fit
my
grow
interest
in
modern
art
phil
s
increase
need
to
be
always
on
the
go
result
in
a
hastily
plan
summer
trip
to
europe
with
the
child
from
which
we
return
in
time
for

june
from
st
albans
a
year
young
than
his
class
but
close
to
the
top
phil
s
advice
to
him
on
departure
be
clear
and
unusual
for
a
newspaperman
stay
away
from
the
crimson
you
have
live
in
a
journalistic
atmosphere
either
at

you
ought
to

to
broaden
your
horizon
don
wait
three
month
before

for
and
make
the
crimson
from
then
on

of

and
he
eventually
be
its
president
our
own
routine
resume
after

with
the
difference
that
we
be

out
more
and
phil

to
some
of
us
who
glance
out
that
they
be
argue
joe
begin
to
think
they
d
never
come
in
and
start
pace
but
just
when
susan
mary
be
convince
the
meal

down

i
ve
never
felt
anything
like
it
it
be
a
physical
sensation
i
felt
i
be
sit
by
a
very
high
power
motor
which
be
rev
up
to
its
full
power
the
other
thing
that
struck
her
be
that
the
president
who
so
rarely
repeat
himself
so
rarely
monopolize
dinner
conversation
ask
the
same
question
twice
first
of
bohlen
then
of
berlin
what

do
historically
when

joe
remember
the

brown
study
the
whole
even
when
the
men
separate
from
the
woman
as
they
regularly
do
after
dinner
he
recall
kennedy
say
of
course
if
you
think
simply
about
the
chance
in
history
you
have
to
quote
the
odds
as
somewhere
near
even
that
we
shall
see
an
h
bomb
war
within
the
next
ten
year
when
the
men
rejoin
the
woman
the
president
again
take
chip
into
the
garden
where
they
stood

back
and
the
president
left
apologize
that
he
have
an
early
and
hard
next
day
and
still
argue
with
chip
as
he
go
down

front
step
this
be
at
the
start
of

be
urge
him
to
stay
home
and
remain
part
of
this
executive
committee
but
know
that
a
change
of
his
plan
might
tip
off
the
soviet

the
president
that
he
and
avis
should
sail
the
next
day
as
arrange

later
that

show
what
a
real
pro

be
sacrifice
his
own
participation
in
the
crucial
event
of

yesterday
wrap
itself
in
one
of
the
tightest
cloak
of
secrecy
ever
see
in
peace
time
while
key
policymakers
work
out
a
major
international
decision
they
be
forbidden
to
discus
at
the
white

and
the
state
and
defense
department
official
refuse
to
confirm
or
deny
report
publish
in
the
washington
post
yesterday
that
cuba
be
the
focus
of
the
extraordinary
operation
that
day
monday
october

and
a

who
be
to
dine
with
the
kennedy
watch
the
speech
at
bill
s
house
in
georgetown
and
then
tore
down
to
the
white
house
to
be
there
by
the
time
the
president
get
upstairs
from
the
basement
broadcast
facility
bill
recall
tell
kennedy
that
he
have
give
a
very
impressive
peace
speech
to
which
kennedy
reply
but
right
now
we
be
just
listen
and
pray
we
don
t
know
what
s
go
to
happen
at
that
moment
a
white
house
aide
drew
them
aside
and
say
if
there
be
trouble
you
and
miss
chavchavadze
will
be
whisk
off
with
them
and
you
ll
just
have
to
go
which
meant
go
to
a
protect
facility
in
the
countryside
built
especially
for
the
president
helen
burst
into
tear
sob
that
she
couldn
t
go
because
she
have
left
her
two
small
child
at
home
with
a
nanny
i
can
t
go
i
won
t
go
she
say
the
aide
quiet
her
by
say
in
fact
we
think
it
will
be
all
right
phil
behave
perfectly
well
throughout
the
cuban
missile
crisis
except
perhaps
for
carry
out
kennedy
s
wish
too
literally
but
it
be
a
hard
call
to
make
in
view
of
what
be
at
stake
my
own
reaction
be
one
of
concern
for
the
world
but
i
didn
t
really
believe
it
would
come
to
all
out
war
and
cannot
remember
feel
any
personal
fear
the
prospect
of
nuclear
war
seem
more
unreal
to
all
of
us
than
it
actually
be
at
about
this
time
phil
make
two
more
significant
purchase
accelerate
the
buying
trend
so
typical
of
this
phase
of
the
illness
that
no
one
have
yet
name
only
later
do
i
learn
that
buying
thing
be
a
well
know
symptom
of
manic
depression
in
the
first
case
he
saw
a
classify
ad
in
the
post
for
a
farm
about
five
mile
from
glen
welby
in
hume
virginia
a
farm
that
consist
of
acre
and
a
house
all
for
phil
sent
for
an
aerial
photo
and
without
even
visit
ask
his
lawyer
to
take
care
of
everything
so
that
he
would
only
have
to
sign
the
final
contract
he
accomplish
the
whole
purchase
in
just
two
week
with
a
down
payment
of
which
be
provide
ironically
as
it
later
turn
out
by
me
i
m
sure
i
have
no
logical
reason
for
accede
to
the
idea
of
acquire
a
second
farm
no
doubt
i
agree
to
it
because
i
agree
to
almost
everything
i
certainly
understood
that
we
didn
t
need
a
second
farm
but
i
believe
that
phil
have
to
be
mollify
i
also
be
fully
aware
that
he
d
often
bought
thing
about
which
i
d
have
doubt
that
turn
out
to
be
good
acquisition
in
the
end
as
usual
i
thought
who
be
i
to
question
this
phil
also
decide
to
purchase
a
big
expensive
plane
a
gulfstream
normally
people
order
this
kind
of
plane
month
ahead
of
delivery
but
phil
want
it
so
immediately
that
he
take
the
model
the
grumman
company
use
for
demonstration
purpose
it
be
my
mother
who
suggest
we
think
about
the
consequence
of
have
a
plane
at
our
disposal
she
write
phil
let
me
utter
one
caution
about
the
plane
it
be
bound
to
speed
up
your
life
far
more
than
do
the
automobile
in
former
day
you
both
need
to
protect
your
physical
resource
more
than
do
other
people
with
duller
nervous
system
a
great
future
lie
before
you
which
your
beautiful
partnership
will
make
as
joyous
as
it
will
be
important
to
your
country
if
you
will
both
keep
watch
on
your
own
and
each
other
s
health
mother
be
still
totally
unaware
of
phil
s
problem
but
be
staunchly
brave
and
supportive
later

one
day
when
phil
gratuitously
turn
on
him
nothing
have
stimulate
him
he
just
want
to
be
abusive
max
say
which
seem
typical
of
the
explosion
that
be
become
habitual
max
also
later
told
me
that
around
the
time
of
the
embargo
of
the
news
on
cuba
they
be
in
phil
s
office
when
phil
get
a
phone
call
from
the
president
max
start
to
leave
but
phil
told
him
to
stay
and
he
heard
phil
talk
to
the
president
as
i
have
never
heard
two
french
truck
driver
in
an
accident
talk
to
each
other
and
the
president
do
not
hang
up
phil
be
become
more
intolerant
and
offensive
use
foul
language
to
excess
during
the
summer
of
he
have
start
to
direct
his
angry
outburst
at
me
but
there
be
bad
to
come
in
mid
november
he
met
with
the
incorporators
of
comsat
on
what
turn
out
to
be
a
traumatic
occasion
at
one
point
probably
toward
the
end
of
the
afternoon
session
accord
to
max
isenbergh
phil
turn
to
him
and
say
moose
max
s
nickname
take
over
i
m
go
to
the
metropolitan
club
to
get
a
massage
and
he
walk
out
that
session
be
adjourn
fairly
soon
afterwards
and
everyone
go
off
to
dinner
at
the
f
street
club
where
phil
rejoin
them
it
be
here
that
one
of
the
board
member
byrne
litschgi
respond
to
a
press
release
that
have
be
prepared
that
afternoon
and
which
concentrate
on
relatively
minor
appointment
of
personnel
and
consultant
suggest
that
it
be
very
important
that
the
public
know
that
you
re
have
stellar
personnel
and
that
s
a
policy
of
comsat
but
i
think
we
ought
to
have
a
policy
statement
of
some
kind
very
soon
at
that
point
phil
become
abusive
and
lunge
across
the
table
as
if
to
strike
litschgi
people
be
aghast
and
phil
be
escort
out
of
the
room
everybody
be
baffle
no
one
knew
what
to
do
several
of
the
incorporators
stayed
there
talk
until
about
a
m
phil
come
home
and
recount
the
story
to
me
tell
me
how
this
man
have
push
him
beyond
endurance
and
that
he
felt
he
have
to
go
away
for
a
rest
and
to
regain
his
calm
the
very
next
day
we
make
hasty
plan
to
leave
for
palm
spring
though
when
we
get
there
he
decide
he
didn
t
like
it
in
california
so
we
packed
up
and
left
for
the
arizona
biltmore
in
phoenix
we
take
with
us
on
this
trip
liz
hylton
who
have
be
recruit
from
the
accounting
department
by
phil
s
secretary
charlie
paradise
she
have
be
unhappy
in
accounting
and
phil
have
brought
her
in
as
number
three
in
his
office
liz
remains
with
me
to
this
day
my
invaluable
assistant
after
only
a
few
day
away
phil
write
to
litschgi
manage
to
work
in
some
of
his
resentment
against
the
man
and
only
half
backing
off
i
realize
that
the
conventionally
proper
form
after
an
outburst
of
anger
such
as
mine
would
be
to
write
a
note
of
apology
and
to
ask
you
to
forget
the
episode
but
after
five
day
of
rest
and
sun
and
contemplation
i
be
not
go
to
be
so
conventional
because
to
do
so
would
be
so
patronize
and
inhuman
and
insincere
i
shall
say
this
it
be
very
regrettable
for
anyone
to
flare
as
i
do
but
i
think
it
be
equally
more
regrettable
for
anyone
to
act
as
woodenly
unimaginatively
and
frustratingly
as
you
have
act
as
incorporator
enough
of
that
i
have
told
myself
that
you
be
perhaps
under
strain
by
reason
of
be
new
to
be
on
board
i
have
told
myself
you
may
simply
be
one
of
those
unfortunate
who
utterly
lack
a
sense
of
humor
or
a
spirit
of
imagination
but
it
be
not
for
me
to
presume
to
make
such
patronize
analysis
of
you
don
t
fight
be
angry
emotion
be
more
helpful
to
useful
human
action
than
they
admit
in
harvard
law
school
and
you
be
entitle
to
be
angry
over
my
mean
and
hyperbolic
blast
i
want
sincerely
to
apologize
to
you
and
then
go
on
and
work
with
you
in
agreement
or
in
direct
manly
outspoken
disagreement
heaven
know
there
be
room
for
lot
of
disagreement
in
this
matter
and
direct
open
disagreement
can
let
in
light
and
lead
to
sensible
solution
and
i
will
apologize
to
you
and
work
with
you
when
i
have
heard
a
forthright
expression
of
your
grievance
and
any
acknowledgment
of
your
possible
lapse
you
may
care
to
make
a
couple
of
week
later
phil
write
litschgi
again
this
time
opening
with
an
honest
self
analysis
of
this
incident
i
fear
i
be
like
some
deep
sea
animal
who
cannot
rise
quickly
to
the
surface
without
excess
decompression
in
any
event
my
rise
have
be
slow
my
first
letter
to
you
be
just
part
of
the
gradual
decompression
now
i
wish
to
say
that
i
have
thought
through
the
situation
and
now
i
can
with
complete
honesty
say
i
wish
to
apologize
fully
my
behavior
be
inhumane
and
unpardonable
i
cannot
plead
mitigate
circumstance
because
i
don
t
believe
in
them
for
such
bad
conduct
i
also
want
to
say
that
you
have
behave
yourself
in
a
most
gentlemanly
way
i
hope
and
believe
your
example
will
be
contagious
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
i
look
forward
to
work
with
you
it
s
impossible
to
know
whether
time
or
a
third
person
brought
about
this
change
in
view
apart
from
deal
with
some
correspondence
and
business
mostly
comsat
related
phil
and
i
have
a
comparatively
quiet
time
in
phoenix
play
golf
and
rest
in
the
middle
of
the
first
week
phil
ask
me
to
go
with
our
plane
to
the
lockheed
field
in
burbank
california
to
tell
the
people
there
how
to
redesign
the
interior
which
be
due
for
refit
in
early
december
our
showroom
model
plane
have
partition
with
cutout
of
dance
girl
and
come
to
hawaii
motif
all
of
which
be
to
be
take
out
and
replace
and
i
be
to
choose
the
fabric
and
design
phil
also
suggest
that
while
i
be
in
california
i
should
call
my
sister
flo
and
meet
her
for
lunch
initially
i
protest
think
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
arrange
and
say
that
in
any
case
we
be
suppose
to
go
to
los
angeles
the
follow
week
to
meet
about
the
news
service
so
why
bother
now
call
her
phil
insist
and
if
necessary
meet
halfway
so
i
do
flo
and
i
met
at
the
brown
derby
and
have
a
long
touch
memorable
lunch
we
talk
intimately
about
our
parent
with
her
rail
at
great
length
about
how
much
she
disliked
mother
who
she
complain
have
succeed
in
break
up
flo
s
most
important
early
romance
one
with
david
grene
whom
i
have
know
at
chicago
and
one
with
drew
pearson
who
have
be
judged
not
suitable
by
my
mother
flo
view
that
particularly
bitterly
give
that
mother
later
become
a
great
friend
of
drew
s
flo
be
so
obviously
sad
and
torment
by
all
these
event
in
the
distant
past
that
i
finally
say
wouldn
t
you
be
happier
if
you
put
all
this
behind
you
after
all
you
be
fifty
and
she
s
seventy
five
isn
t
it
time
my
question
have
little
effect
she
remain
adamantly
negative
about
mother
ours
however
happily
for
me
be
a
close
and
love
exchange
except
for
the
unhappiness
about
the
past
she
seem
well
when
i
left
her
we
be
both
look
forward
to
our
return
to
los
angeles
in
a
week
or
so
and
see
more
of
each
other
four
day
after
our
lunch
a
messenger
come
and
get
me
in
the
middle
of
a
golf
game
to
say
that
flo
have
die
suddenly
as
far
as
anyone
know
there
be
no
warn
grief
stricken
as
i
be
i
felt
and
remain
grateful
to
phil
for
insist
that
i
call
her
for
that
lunch
we
immediately
flew
to
los
angeles
again
phil
rise
to
the
occasion
and
be
the
great
help
in
every
way
to
flo
s
boy
vincent
and
larry
and
to
me
i
be
deeply
fond
of
flo
she
be
so
beautiful
and
funny
and
literate
and
sad
she
adore
her
boy
and
have
brought
them
up
carefully
and
closely
i
will
never
be
able
to
appraise
the
strange
relationship
she
have
with
the
halperns
who
seem
to
have
such
a
strong
hold
over
her
after
flo
s
death
they
produce
a
letter
sign
by
her
say
that
if
anything
happen
to
her
they
the
halperns
be
to
have
the
boy
soon
after
the
funeral
the
halperns
left
for
europe
without
tell
any
of
us
take
the
boy
with
them
flo
have
have
a
bitter
divorce
and
the
eventual
settlement
exclude
her
husband
from
her
boy
life
he
remarry
and
i
think
take
no
interest
in
them
after
that
it
become
next
to
impossible
to
see
or
know
the
homolka
boy
until
the
young
one
larry
return
home
and
married
his
high
school
girlfriend
against
the
halperns
will
vincent
life
in
england
and
relates
to
mr
halpern
i
ve
see
him
only
once
he
give
most
of
his
money
away
and
life
a
spartan
existence
after
flo
s
funeral
we
go
back
to
phoenix
and
the
night
before
we
head
home
have
drink
with
harry
and
clare
luce
in
their
house
which
adjoin
the
biltmore
ground
despite
the
few
week
of
rest
intersperse
with
a
certain
amount
of
activity
phil
s
mood
be
agitate
at
dinner
that
night
he
remove
clare
s
plastic
shoe
declare
them
to
be
unworthy

then
as
we
be
leave
he
picked
her
up
and
carry
her
to
the
car
clearly
a
reflection
of
his
fundamentally
aberrant
behavior
only
the
superficial
effect
of
all
phil
s
activity
the
news
service
expansion
the
purchase
of
artnews
the

well

could
have

another
big
one

i
didn
t
want
to

greedy
the
article

quote
phil

next
day
he
flew
to
europe
on
comsat
business
it
be
on
this
second
trip
within
five
week
that
phil
reconnected
with
robin
webb
on
the
official
schedule
she
be
described
by
phil
as
newsweek
reporter
and
temporary
personal
shopper
tour
director
and
femme
de
chambre
for
our
group
i
have
no
idea
what
be
go
on
in
paris
except
that
i
thought
phil
be
engage
in
a
very
important
task
soon
after
he
come
home
we
settle
in
at
our
r
street
house
for
the
christmas
holiday
phil
have
grown
increasingly
to
dislike
christmas
and
gradually
i
have
take
over
everything
have
to
do
with
it
decorate
planning
gift
buying
party
especially
since
his
year
of
mood
swing
that
christmas
eve
afternoon
the
world
i
have
know
and
love
end
for
me
the
phone
rang
and
i
picked
it
up
not
realize
that
phil
too
have
picked
it
up
in
his
dress
room
with
the
door
shut
i
heard
phil
and
robin
talk
to
each
other
in
word
that
make
the
situation
plain
i
wait
until
he
have
hung
up
and
go
right
in
and
ask
him
if
what
i
have
surmise
be
true
he
say
it
be
it
s
hard
to
describe
my
total
devastation
after
my
discovery
of
the
affair
this
kind
of
thing
have
happen
to
innumerable
people
of
both
sex
but
i
have
never
dream
it
could
happen
to
me
i
knew
that
marriage
could
endure
momentary
disloyalty
but
this
be
different
it
s
very
hard
to
understand
even
in
retrospect
how
the
possibility
of
his
have
an
affair
have
never
occur
to
me
i
be
so
blind
by
the
closeness
of
our
relationship
and
by
what
we
have
be
through
together
in
the
last
year
my
feel
that
something
fundamental
have
be
destroyed
be
a
result
of
my
own
total
commitment
and
my
belief
that
these
feeling
go
both
way
also
it
be
part
of
my
bafflement
at
what
i
saw
as
phil
s
increasingly
strange
behavior
i
have
no
understand
of
the
context
of
the
terrible
depression
he
have
come
through
or
the
polar
opposite
mood
that
be
dominate
him
at
the
time
not
even
then
have
anyone
bother
to
utter
the
term
manic
depressive
i
truly
believe
that
he
and
i
be
bound
together
by
time
by
choice
by
share
experience
by
our
family
and
by
the
life
of
the
company
that
be
so
important
to
both
of
us
phil
be
clearly
upset
too
he
told
me
that
he
want
to
preserve
our
marriage
and
our
family
he
say
that
he
love
robin
but
would
tell
her
the
affair
be
over
and
that
he
would
stay
with
his
family
it
be
a
memorable
christmas
holiday
i
be
wrench
apart
by
find
out
about
the
whole
thing
and
phil
be
torn
at
have
decide
to
end
it
he
knew
a
breakup
would
be
terribly
difficult
for
robin
so
to
help
her
recover
he
sent
her
on
a
vacation
in
the
sunshine
and
even
sent
along
a
friend
of
his
to
keep
her
company
the
friend
turn
out
to
be
another
girl
from
his
past
about
whom
i
of
course
have
never
know
for
some
reason
in
those
immediate
day
after
my
discovery
of
robin
s
existence
phil
seem
to
have
a
compulsion
to
tell
me
much
more
than
i
want
to
know
about
this
side
of
his
life
of
which
i
have
be
happily
oblivious
about
his
past
relation
with
other
woman
of
whom
there
apparently
have
be
several
i
be
of
course
shatter
as
well
as
completely
stun
to
learn
of
his
interest
in
others
include
some
of
my
own
friend
to
whom
he
have
make
approach
and
robin
s
companion
with
whom
he
say
he
have
have
a
long
strange
relationship
of
the
child
at
first
only
lally
knew
that
something
be
wrong
she
have
plan
to
go
skiing
in
aspen
with
friend
over
the
holiday
but
phil
told
her
what
have
happen
and
ask
her
to
give
up
her
trip
and
stay
home
while
we
all
try
to
get
our
bearing
which
she
heroically
do
a
sad
small
but
symbolic
event
take
place
during
this
time
which
seem
to
me
to
be
the
nadir
we
be
at
crescent
place
and
my
mother
give
me
some
long
pretty
paste
earring
of
hers
it
meant
a
great
deal
to
me
she
be
not
very
forthcoming
about
that
kind
of
thing
and
it
have
never
happen
before
phil
say
you
don
t
wear
long
earring
and
lally
do
give
them
to
her
how
could
i
have
simply
obeyed
but
i
do
i
hand
them
to
lally
and
go
out
by
myself
to
the
pantry
where
i
burst
into
tear
i
suppose
i
didn
t
have
the
strength
to
resist
and
just
quietly
laugh
and
keep
them
which
any
normal
person
would
have
do
to
me
it
be
symbolic
of
lose
everything
i
felt
ultimately
demean
during
the
few
week
after
i
found
out
about
robin
phil
drank
a
great
deal
and
there
be
many
problem
overlaid
with
our
attempt
to
hold
thing
together
and
keep
our
life
go
one
night
before
the
end
of
the
college
holiday
and
so
before
lally
and
don
go
back
to
school
i
have
an
especially
hard
time
with
phil
we
be
at
home
and
he
have
have
a
lot
to
drink
and
be
say
some
wild
thing
most
of
which
be
not
very
rational
i
finally
get
him
to
go
to
bed
but
not
until
around
two
in
the
morning
when
i
come
out
of
our
room
to
turn
off
the
light
throughout
the
house
i
saw
don
look
spectral
and
drawn
sit
at
my
desk
in
the
room
right
next
door
to
the
bedroom
how
long
have
this
be
go
on
he
ask
refer
to
phil
s
drinking
and
the
row
i
confess
that
it
have
be
for
some
time
why
have
you
never
told
me
he
ask
should
i
have
told
him
who
know
we
all
try
to
protect
our
child
and
my
natural
response
be
to
keep
this
from
them
i
don
t
know
that
i
be
right
perhaps
it
s
well
to
share
problem
with
child
as
they
grow
old
we
somehow
get
through
the
nightmare
holiday
season
phil
and
i
be
both
try
to
make
thing
work
to
keep
up
some
semblance
of
normalcy
even
as
our
personal
world
have
fall
apart
we
attend
some
dinner
and
go
out
a
few
time

remember
one
even
go
to
a
musicale
at
the
frankfurter
on
our
return
home
phil
reprimand
me
for
look
so
deject
and
drawn
when
we
be
try
to
conceal
thing
at
the
begin
of
january
phil
go
to
new
york
for
a
meeting
of
comsat
which
he
be
still
run
and
run
well
he
have
breakfast
with
larry
collins
who
be
leave
for
paris
tell
him
too
that
he
be
very
much
in
love
with
robin
but
want
to
get
his
priority
straight
and
keep
the
family
together
we
be
both
just
move
numbly
through
our
day
phil
wire
lally
at
college
about
a
routine
matter
but
it
end
with
all
be
very
well
here
much
love
to
you

at
some
point
however
not
quite
three
week
after

eve
the
phone
start
to
work
again
between
phil
and
robin
on
january
after
dinner
phil
and
i
have
an
argument
i
can
t
remember
what
precipitate
it
the
upshot
be
that
he
walk
out
of
the
house
hold
a
blanket
get
in
the
car
and
drove
away
i
have
no
idea
where
he
d
go
he
later
told
me
that
if
i
have
come
after
him
he
would
have
come
home
my
response
be
that
i
hadn
t
know
where
he
d
go
and
still
didn
t
know
where
would
i
go
he
reply
the
office
of
course
by
this
time
robin

return
to

phil
call
and
told
her
to
come
back
to

as
soon
as
she
could
evidently
she
protest
say
that
she
be
just
begin
to
recover
and
that
he
have
be
right
the
first
time
they
should
end
the
relationship
he
say
that
if
she
didn
t
come
he
would
come
and
get
her
accord
to
larry
collins
robin
thought
that
phil

a
really
bad
state
and
that
she
be
the
only
person
who
could
really
talk
to
him
so
she
decide
to
come
back
robin
webb
behave
well
throughout
she
be
as
much
caught
up
in
the
tragedy
and
a
victim
of
it
as
the
rest
of
us
she
be
obviously
mesmerize
by
phil

mind

ask
incredulous
don
t
you
realize
what
he
do
to
you
don
t
you
realize
he
put
you
down
all
the
time
that
you
be
the
butt
of
all
the
family
joke
she
give
me
several
instance
though
i
didn
t
agree
totally
i
get
a
glimmer
of
what
she
meant
but
lorraine
didn
t
understand
the
other
side
that
he
have
also
built
me
up
i
literally
believe
that
he
have
create
me
that
i
be
totally
dependent
on
him
and
i
didn
t
see
the
downside
at
all
from
sioux
fall
phil
and
robin
flew
to
phoenix
where
many
of
the
nation
s
most
prominent
publisher
be
gather
for
a
meeting
of
the
associate
press
otis

and
his
wife
missy
met
phil
and
robin
at
the
airport
accord
to
otis
who
told
me
all
of
this
only
much
later
phil
be
dishevel
and
spin
out
idea
some
of
which
otis
found
interest
and
others
of
which
be
unintelligible
it
be
clear
to
him
that
phil
be
not
well
he
say
that
from
the
moment
he
first
saw
phil
he
begin
to
worry
about
how
he
be
go
to
handle
the
dinner
that
even
and
what
he
could
do
to
help
phil
get
through
it
otis
be
unsure
if
it
be
phil
s
mental
state
or
if
he
be
keep
himself
perpetually
drunk
or
both
but
certainly
phil
be
make
very
little
sense
he
have
even
gotten
upset
over
the
chandler
not
stay
right
next
door
to
him
and
robin
at
the
biltmore
hotel
also
by
this
time
there
be
a
lot
of
four

at
the
dinner
when
ben

and
president
of

ap
rise
phil
stood
up
and
go
straight
to
the
lectern
where
he
begin
to
speak
he
start
out
say
some
nice
thing
about
the
star
but
his
remark
quickly
degenerate
turn
into
nonsense
intersperse
with
ugly
language
no
one
present
that
night
have
ever
told
me
exactly
what
happen
or
what
phil
say
report
of
his
obscene
comment
have
appear
in
several
book
but
at
the
time
those
who
witness
this
sorry
spectacle
seem
only
to
have
talk
among
themselves
as
with
other
outrageous
behavior
by
note
or
know
person
in
those
day
the
incident
be
hush
up
and

wild
remark
attack
individual
as
well
as
the
press
in

up
and
manage
to
get
him
off
the
platform
and

the
use
of

in
year
one
of
these
call
have
be
to
me
it
be
the
only
exchange
i
ever
have
with
robin
webb
and
be
a
sensitive
one
she
say
i
do
love
him
but
you
be
there
first
one
of
the
most
important
call
phil
make
be
to
lally
who
adore
her
father
more
than
anyone
in
the
world
but
who
be
a
pillar
of
strength
and
stability
to
me
then
and
throughout
all
those
terrible
month
at
the
same
time
as
she
be
try
to
be
understand
with
her
father
she
be
always
love
but
firm
with
both
of
us
at
this
point
she
call
me
from
cambridge
and
say
he
need
her
and
she
thought
she
have
to
go
since
at
that
point
it
have
be
decide
that
dr
farber
and
a
fine
scot
psychiatrist
ian
cameron
whom
farber
have
brought
in
to
consult
be
to
bring
phil
home
i
be
reluctant
to
have
her
go
i
understood
her
desire
but
hat
her
be
there
for
what
be
sure
to
be
an
ugly
scene
her
response
be
adamant
i
m
his
daughter
and
he
say
he
need
me
so
i
have
to
go
i
couldn
t
help
agree
don
drove

in
boston
and
on
an
impulse
get
on
the
plane
and
go
with
her
the
doctor
have
decide
to
try
to
get
phil
to
return
to
washington
voluntarily
and
if
not
to
bring
him
back
forcibly
i
gather
that
farber
initially
try
to
read
him
passage
from
martin
buber
and
when
this
fail
to
work
they
forcibly
tranquilize
him
and
put
him
on
the
plane
under
the
strain
circumstance
robin
be
sent
away
with
too
little
care
and
attention
when
the
plane
land
in
washington
there
be
an
ambulance
wait
and
another
scene
in
a
small
private
terminal
at

at
this
point
phil

walk
away
and
have
to

by
the
child
the
three
of

private
mental
hospital
in
a
suburb
of
washington
select
by
farber
phil
view
this
whole
sequence
of
event
with
some
reason
as
a
violation
of
his
right
and
civil
liberty
as
he
be
be
take
out
of

critical
as
the
situation

so
rapidly
no

that
much
longer
without

and
your

strongly
with
you
and
be
hopeful
that
thing
will
now
go
well
no
two
people
deserve
it
more
phil
be
see
dr
farber
daily
at
the
hospital
and
dr
cameron
when
farber
be
call
out
of
town
to
visit
a
die
old
brother
when
the
two
psychiatrist
and
i
be
meeting
with
post
executive
all
deeply
concerned
about
phil
cameron
threw
a
bucket
of
cold
water
on
the
group
by
say
i
don
t
understand
why
you
all
care
so
much
about
this
man
as
an
outsider
who
didn
t
know
phil
he
be
react
to
everything
he
be
hearing
about
phil
s
behavior
i
must
say
that
remark
shook
us
up
in
meeting
over
the
next
few
day
farber
and
cameron
confess
to
me
that
they
be
puzzle
by
my
refusal
just
to
give
up
at
some
point
by
my
protestation
that
i
be
a
one
man
dog
and
my
unwillingness
to
accept
that
phil
might
have
left
me
for
another
woman
and
my
emotional
belief
that
i
could
never
love
another
man
in
a
way
they
be
right
to
ask
the
question
but
in
a
way
not
it
may
be
unusual
to
think
you
can
never
love
another
person
and
they
certainly
thought
it
suspect
but
at
the
time
it
be
true
for
me
phil
s
brother
bill
come
up
from
florida
to
be
with
him
and
to
represent
him
at
this
time
he
stayed
a
few
day
make
an
important
phone
call
to
robin
and
be
enormously
helpful
to
both
phil
and
me
phil
write
him
on
january
thank
him
for
elect
yourself
old
brother
pro
tempore
and
add
i
be
do
my
steady
best
to
relieve
you
of
the
latter
responsibility
with
all
deliberate
and
prudent
patient
cautious
thoughtful
speed
after
a
few
day
at
the
lodge
phil
begin
go
out
to
le
farber
s
office
for
visit
only
five
day
after
he
have
be
flown
back
from
arizona
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
at
farber
s
office
and
drove
back
to
chestnut
lodge
with
him
i
go
again
the
next
day
we
talk
for
a
long
time
and
he
told
me
in
great
detail
both
how
terrible
the
scene
have
be
at
george
washington
university
hospital
and
how
kind
and
wise
have
be
the
people
at
chestnut
lodge
who
have
talk
him
down
to
his
present
fairly
cool
state
phil
told
bill
graham
of
our
talk
say
in
his
january
letter
kay
and
i
be
have
especially
good
talk
the
first
free
from
any
lie
and
deceit
on
my
part
in
a
good
many
year
she
be
still
as
you
know
very
tire
and
more
deeply
wound
than
you
may
suspect
we
talk
a
lot
about
what
have
happen
i
felt
rock
to
my
foundation
by
all
these
event
but
i
knew
i
have
somehow
to
endure
them
difficult
as
that
might
prove
to
be
and
i
still
hop
and
believe
that
we
could
restore
our
relationship
and
keep
phil
function
and
the
family
together
i
suppose
the
repeat
experience
of
see
him
resume
his
life
after
period
of
depression
encourage
me
to
believe
that
thing
would
once
again
be
all
right
phil
be
also
reading
and
think
he
reread
an
article
by
martin
buber
on
guilt
and
quote
a
few
passage
to
bill
say
no
one
other
than
he
who
inflict
the
wound
can
heal
it
and
then
he
say
that
a
man
who
have
do
evil
must
with
a
broad
and
endure
wave
of
light
find
self
illumination
about
the
sum
total
of
his
guilt
even
after
he
have
long
pass
out
of
guilt
to
persevere
in
humble
knowledge
that
he
be
the
same
man
as
the
man
who
be
guilty
and
then
proceed
on
to
reparation
of
the
wound
he
have
cause
those
wound
cannot
be
call
back
or
wipe
away
but
the
wound
can
be
heal
in
infinitely
many
other
place
than
those
at
which
they
be
inflict
at
the
moment
i
be
correctly
place
to
experience
and
i
be
get
there
not
by
order
or
instruction
but
by
have
a
quiet
time
and
the
help
of
doctor
and
nurse
to
permit
me
to
get
myself
to
full
confession
on
my
own
it
be
my
first
experience
with
confession
humble
and
strengthen
and
i
shall
old
brother
keep
work
after
about
ten
day
at
chestnut
lodge
phil
go
to
see
dr
farber
three
day
in
a
row
i
don
t
know
whether
i
be
delude
myself
or
whether
it
be
some
sort
of
denial
but
i
actually

and
you
can
tell
sylvia
that
i
be
extremely

and
fully
back
at

in
addition
to
my
journalistic
duty
i
be
give
considerable
attention
to
a
young
newsweek
reporter
miss
robin
webb
it
be
my
hope
to
get
a
divorce
in
the
reasonably
near
future
and
to
marry
robin
soon
thereafter
we

a
meal
with
you
and

if
we
be
invite
phil
also
write
a
patient
he
have
gotten
to
know
at
chestnut
lodge
say
that
he
miss
him
and
the
other
patient
and
would
call
on
them
as
soon
as
he
could
arrange
to
he
encourage
one
of
the
patient
to
write
to
him
at
the
washington
post
explain
after
day
of
return
home
and
a
telephone
call
to
robin
webb
in
paris
i
realize
what
i
want
to
do
she
come
over
on
february
th
and
we
be
living
in
new
york
in
separate
apartment
on
the
advice
of
lawyer
and
go
for
weekend
to
my
funny
farm
near
hume
virginia
i
hope
to
get
a
divorce
so
that
we
can
marry
before
too
long
phil
knew
that
he
control
the
post
because
my
father
have
give
him
the
majority
of
a
share
he
felt
he
own
it
because
he
have
work
for
seventeen
year
to
make
it
a
success
so
from
his
point
of
view
the
paper
be
his
he
contrive
a
plan
which
quickly
get
back
to
me
of
pay
me
off
by
buying
back
my
stock
with
post
money
he
and
robin
would
then
be
in
charge
in
some
way
this
be
the
bottom
moment
for
me
very
confuse
very
difficult
and
very
painful
not
only
have
i
lose
my
husband
but
i
be
about
to
lose
the
post
i
saw
his
plan
as
a
logical
aspect
of
his
illness
and
i
knew
he
be
really
ill
but
by
now
the
effect
be
real
and
i
be
frighten
i
be
also
terrify
by
ed
williams
s
new
role
as
phil
s
lawyer
i
didn
t
know
ed
very
well
then
but
i
be
aware
of
his
reputation
as
a
successful
criminal
attorney
and
litigator
and
i
envision
terrible
court
scene
and
battle
i
have
to
face
fact
phil
be
really
go
he
have
left
me
for
good
and
i
have
to
come
to
term
with
this
devastate
reality
it
be
almost
more
than
i
could
bear
my
feeling
about
the
post
however
be
very
clear
my
father
have
indeed
give
phil
the
major
part
of
the
stock
and
phil
have
run
the
company
well
but
it
be
my
father
s
financial
backing
that
have
enable
the
post
to
build
a
new
building
and
later
to
buy
the
time
herald
and
ensure
its
future
it
be
the
million
invest
in
the
paper
by
my
father
that
enable
it
to
survive
the
year
of
loss
it
be
my
pay
all
our
living
expense
that
have
allow
phil
to
purchase
his
stock
with
his
income
from
the
post
so
my
bitterness
about
his
plan
be
extreme
and
my
intention
to
dig
in
be
total
i
be
not
about
to
give
up
the
paper
without
a
fight
i
need
a
lawyer
as
head
of
the
company
fritz
beebe
phil
s
friend
and
mine
have
to
be
neutral
in
all
this
so
the
cravath
firm
our
estate
lawyer
sent
me
to
the
respectable
and
able
whitney
north
seymour
of
simpson
thacher
bartlett
who
advise
me
just
to
sit
tight
for
the
moment
although
i
be
prepared
for
the
roof
to
fall
in
on
me
nothing
actually
happen
for
the
next
few
month
there
be
no
movement
toward
divorce
despite
all
phil
s
talk
about
it
ed
williams
told
me
later
that
he
have
advise
phil
not
to
move
right
in
with
robin
but
to
live
separately
and
to
wait
that
you
couldn
t
walk
out
of
your
house
one
day
and
ask
for
a
divorce
the
next
although
i
wasn
t
directly
talk
with
phil
i
be
always
aware
of
his
and
robin
s
whereabouts
either
through
other
people
s
report
or
through
his
call
to
the
child
which
begin
soon
after
he
left
he
take
robin
to
florida
to
meet
his
father
who
as
phil
report
in
a
letter
to
clark
clifford
promise
robin
he
d
live
long
enough
to
come
to
our
wedding
even
if
the
divorce
take
two
year
phil
and
robin
return
from
florida
to
settle
in
at
the
pearson
farm
the
farm
he
have
bought
in
the
fall
of
with
my
help
there
he
begin
to
build
pond
and
in
essence
to
reproduce
the
life
we
have
at
glen
welby
it
be
not
unnatural
that
phil
would
want
to
create
a
nice
farm
out
of
this
ramshackle
place
he
d
bought
but
i
found
it
haunt
that
the
life
he
be
reconstruct
seem
to
be
a
mirror
image
of
everything
we
have
do
together
the
farm
the
house
near
georgetown
he
eventually
rent
and
even
his
trip
to
sioux
fall
phoenix
and
puerto
rico
all
of
which
be
place
where
we
have
be
together
i
go
to
florida
to
see
bill
graham
to
ask
his
advice
bill
be
a
true
support
for
all
of
us
throughout
those
month
after
our
talk
bill
flew
me
up
to
hobe
sound
to
visit
douglas
and
phyllis
dillon
two
loyal
friend
while
i
be
there
i
call
the
post
s
switchboard
to
connect
with
my
house
the
operator
make
a
mistake
and
before
i
knew
it
i
be
connect
with
the
farm
and
robin
be
answer
the
phone
i
hung
up
instantly
but
the
mistake
let
phil
know
i
be
out
of
town
i
then
get
a
wire
from
him
ask
if
he
could
see
the
child
at
the
house
alone
i
be
so
tense
about
everything
that
i
left
the
dillons
at
once
and
flew
home
early
to
prevent
phil
s
come
over
i
think
now
that
i
may
have
be
too
rigid
at
first
about
not
let
him
visit
with
bill
and
steve
they
miss
him
and
want
to
see
him
but
i
be
frighten
by
the
unpredictability
of
his
behavior
i
didn
t
trust
him
or
believe
him
i
didn
t
have
a
very
clear
idea
of
his
condition
and
just
react
emotionally
life
for
all
of
us
settle
into
a
strain
and
endlessly
painful
pattern
i
be
on
my
own
try
to
hold
thing
together
for
myself
and
for
the
child
i
kept
work
on
the
junior
village
project
and
be
also
engage
in
an
undertaking
to
start
a
modern
art
museum
in
washington
but
phil
still
dominate
our
life
he
want
to
see
the
child
and
to
have
them
particularly
lally
meet
robin
i
fear
he
would
even
introduce
her
as
their
potential
stepmother
this
wouldn
t
have
be
the
end
of
the
world
i
suppose
but
not
surprisingly
i
thought
at
the
time
that
it
would
be
when
phil
telephone
the
boy
would
go
into
a
room
and
close
the
door
with
me
fully
aware
that
they
be
experience
the
bad
of
all
world
not
be
able
to
talk
to
one
parent
about
the
other
it
be
excruciate
for
all
of
the
child
in
different
way
but
especially
hard
on
lally
she
show
great
wisdom
and
strength
and
love
for
him
but
not
for
what
he
be
do
or
the
people
around
him
at
that
time
she
agree
to
see
him
in
new
york
but
found
herself
in
a
large
group
include
robin
and
firmly
say
that
she
didn
t
want
to
be
a
part
of
that
don
too
be
very
vulnerable
and
supportive
of
both
of
us
we
finally
work
out
time
when
phil
would
take
bill
and
steve
out
by
himself
usually
pick
them
up
from
school
to
avoid
encounter
me
i
continued
to
get
report
from
mutual
friend
about
where
phil
be
and
what
he
be
up
to
or
i
heard
about
his
activity
directly
in
part
because
some
of
what
he
be
do
be
spectacular
and
quite
public
at
other
time
thing
be
quieter
but
i
would
be
aware
of
what
phil
and
robin
be
do
because
of
bill
or
other
mundane
thing
that
brought
their
coming
and
going
into
my
sphere
they
seem
to
be
settle
in
together
i
get
wind
of
credit
card
have
be
establish
for
robin
and
that
phil
have
separate
our
billing
in
the
country
so
that
everything
at
glen
welby
be
in
my
name
and
everything
at
the
pearson
farm
be
in
his
when
phil
s
secretary
charlie
paradise
ask
me
if
i
want
to
be
list
in
the
phone
book
as
mr
katharine
graham
rather
than
mr
philip
graham
another
small
but
severe
irritation
and
wound
i
say
no
even
during
these
month
when
he
be
living
separately
from
me
i
could
see
indirectly
that
phil
be
do
some
thing
that
make
sense
and
others
that
be
puzzle
one
of
the
more
bizarre
occurrence
of
this
difficult
time
take
place
from
february
to
when
phil
go
up
to
new
york
and
insert
himself
uninvited
and
unwanted
by
the
publisher
into
the
new
york
newspaper
strike
with
the
firm
conviction
that
he
could
settle
it
here
again
phil
involve
president
kennedy
call
him
to
discus
the
implication
of
the
strike
in
his
book
conversation
with
kennedy
ben
bradlee
recall
hold
his
thumb
and
forefinger
close
together
the
president
say
the
line
be
so
damn
narrow
between
rationality
and
irrationality
in
phil
on
march
phil
finally
left
for
two
week
in
puerto
rico
with
robin
during
which
time
he
again
begin
buying
thing
arrange
to
rent
with
an
option
to
acquire
two
apartment
though
these
be
ostensibly
for
the
company
he
and
robin
intend
to
use
them
he
even
write
someone
that
they
might
make
puerto
rico
their
home
base
rather
than
the
pearson
farm
a
few
week
earlier
phil
have
have
an
argument
with
rus
wiggins
over
an
editorial
about

but
it
escalate
his
feud
with

to
the
point
where
phil

a
note
to
his

i

to
the
phil

i
have
so
much
admiration
for
the
difficulty
indeed
be
constant
for
me
for
phil
and
for
the
company
and
those
try
to
hold
it
together
the
whole
affair
as
david
bruce
note
in
one
of
his
diary
entry
be
inexpressibly
sad
chapter
seventeen
i
seem
to
be
living
on
another
planet
the
most
painful
moment
the
one
that
disturbed
me
the
most
profoundly
be
those
in
which
people
report
to
me
that
they
have
see
phil
and
that
he
appear
to
be
rational
and
calm
indeed
quite
well
even
fritz
beebe
at
one
point
told
me
he
seem
fine
i
have
begin
see
dr
cameron
by
this
time
and
he
assure
me
that
people
in
these
state
could
appear
very
normal
for
define
period
of
time
when
they
want
to
but
that
fundamentally
phil
be
not
rational
that
he
be
ill
even
so
despite
his
assurance
the
apparently
normal
encounter
phil
be
have
with
others
shook
me
about
him
and
about
us
be
this
the
real
phil
and
be
this
what
he
really
want
if
so
what
do
that
say
about
our
relationship
about
our
twenty
two
year
together
what
he
seem
to
be
say
be
that
whatever
be
the
matter
with
him
be
my
fault
and
here
be
the
girl
of
his
dream
and
all
he
need
be
to
be
rid
of
me
and
to
be
with
her
and
with
the
post
among
my
staunchest
ally
be
the
restons
scotty
have
see
phil
at
two
or
three
critical
moment
accord
to
him
phil
thought
my
religious
faith
could
help
him
he
thought
inaccurately
as
it
turn
out
that
i
have
this
deep
faith
of
my
mother
and
father
which
i
wish
i
do
have
but
i
do
not
have
at
that
time
i
do
not
tell
him
that
i
told
him
that
i
thought
that
there
be
time
in
life
when
you
go
through
all
these
thing
and
do
he
have
any
feeling
about
religious
faith
that
could
help
him
through
this
period
and
he
say
no
he
do
not
and
i
don
t
know
what
i
say
to
him
that
time
but
it
obviously
be
a
failure
i
be
not
able
to
get
through
to
him
probably
because
i
couldn
t
define
it
myself
in
any
persuasive
way
and
by
then
he
just
go
away
one
day
during
this
period
when
phil
be
away
i
myself
go
to
see
scotty
and
sally
in
a
terrible
state
of
despondency
scotty
remembers
think
that
i
be
give
up
that
i
didn
t
seem
to
have
the
strength
to
go
on
he
say
to
me
kay
you
ve
get
to
fight
for
this
paper
it
do
not
belong
to
phil
graham
your
father
create
this
paper
there
be
not
room
in
washington
for
two
graham
family
you
and
i
can
t
do
anything
about
phil
but
we
can
start
training
donny
and
i
would
like
to
take
him
as
my
clerk
this
summer
which
he
do
the
other
person
who
stiffen
my
back
be
luvie
pearson
who
be
the
closest
most
helpful
most
ever
present
friend
throughout
all
those
month
she
somehow
transmit
to
me
some
of
her
own
extraordinary
strength
and
originality
the
most
important
moment
one
i
will
always
remember
take
place
when
the
two
of
us
be
walk
in
montrose
park
across
the
street
from
my
house
i
be
talk
about
hang
on
to
the
paper
until
the
child
especially
the
boy
since
in
those
day
that
s
how
i
thought
be
old
enough
to
run
it
i
recall
luvie
firmly
and
distinctly
say
don
t
be
silly
dear
you
can
do
it
me
i
exclaim
that
s
impossible
i
couldn
t
possibly
do
it
you
don
t
know
how
hard
and
complicate
it
be
there
s
no
way
i
could
do
it
of
course
you
can
do
it
she
maintain
cissy
patterson
do
it
so
can
you
and
to
counter
my
disclaimer
of
impossibility
luvie
add
you
ve
get
all
those
gene
it
s
ridiculous
to
think
you
can
t
do
it
you
ve
just
be
push
down
so
far
you
don
t
recognize
what
you
can
do
that
be
the
first
time
that
anyone
have
mention
the
idea
of
my
run
the
company
or
that
i
have
even
contemplate
it
in
passing
the
whole
notion
struck
me
as
stun
and
ridiculous
wrongheaded
but
sweet
come
as
it
do
from
my
good
loyal
friend
who
be
try
valiantly
to
buck
me
up
but
who
obviously
didn
t
understand
what
run
the
business
be
all
about
and
what
it
would
take
though
i
didn
t
think
much
more
about
go
to
work
myself
i
do
think
a
lot
about
what
luvie
and
lorraine
before
her
have
say
about
phil
s
attitude
toward
me
and
i
begin
to
realize
how
he
have
be
treat
me
especially
in
the
past
few
year
jean
friendly
later
recall
certain
time
at
glen
welby
when
phil
be
be
very
peculiar
he
be
charm
to
the
child
and
nasty
to
you
he
be
so
mean
at
that
point
to
you
i
couldn
t
get
over
it
she
correctly
understood
that
i
always
view
it
as
a
joke
and
thus
didn
t
see
the
comment
and
behavior
as
put
down
after
phil
s
return
to
washington
from
puerto
rico
i
get
a
call
say
he
want
to
meet
me
at
the
r
street
house
to
discus
the
divorce
and
to
pick
up
some
of
his
thing
i
call
luvie
and
told
her
what
have
be
propose
listen
dear
luvie
say
you
don
t
need
this
i
ll
come
and
pick
you
up
right
away
and
we
ll
drive
out
to
my
farm
i
be
frighten
at
the
idea
of
see
phil
face
to
face
and
uncertain
how
to
handle
it
so
i
readily
agree
to
luvie
s
plan
we
drove
away
in
haste
spent
the
day
at
her
farm
and
return
to
find
that
he
have
packed
up
most
of
his
clothes
and
possession
and
have
apparently
be
angry
at
my
absence
at
one
point
that
spring
polly
wisner
and
another
friend
oatsie
leiter
urge
me
to
go
to
new
york
with
them
to
see
the
ballet
i
have
mostly
be
stay
at
home
where
i
felt
comfortable
be
in
my
own
house
with
the
child
give
me
some
sense
of
routine
as
if
everything
hadn
t
fall
apart
i
have
particularly
stayed
away
from
new
york
because
that
be
part
of
phil
s
and
robin
s
turf
i
hat
think
of
them
in
our
apartment
at
the
carlyle
and
at
newsweek
and
at
other
spot
phil
and
i
have
frequent
both
polly
and
oatsie
however
thought
this
new
york
foray
would
be
a
nice
diversion
on
the
contrary
it
turn
into
one
of
those
star
cross
occasion
when
a
good
idea
go
sour
by
happenstance
before
the
ballet
we
be
have
dinner
at
when
leonard
lyon
the
gossip
columnist
come
up
to
us
and
say
he
d
heard
phil
and
i
be
get
a
divorce
and
he
be
off
with
another
woman
and
be
that
true
i
found
my
food
hard
to
swallow
after
that
interruption
then
we
go
on
to
the
theater
and
discover
that
our
ticket
be
for
the
next
night
so
we
bought
whatever
last
seat
be
left
in
order
to
save
the
even
from
be
a
complete
bust
no
one
conspire
against
this
expedition
the
whole
fiasco
be
accidental
nevertheless
it
give
me
a
feel
of
complete
rejection
and
exclusion
i
felt
that
no
one
care
that
i
didn
t
count
anymore
and
that
life
be
passing
me
by
all
the
good
thing
be
go
to
phil
i
be
certainly
vulnerable
ready
to
be
wound
so
that
even
a
petty
misfortune
like
the
ticket
seem
to
be
a
straw
break
more
than
the
proverbial
camel
s
back
the
trip
to
cheer
me
up
brought
me
down
low
than
ever
many
of
our
friend
be
caught
in
a
bind
quite
often
they
be
push
by
phil
to
receive
robin
for
the
most
part
they
didn
t
but
say
they
would
when
thing
between
phil
and
me
get
sort
out
the
friendly
be
particularly
strong
about
stress
their
love
of
him
and
loyalty
to
him
but
their
disinclination
to
accept
the
new
arrangement
until
it
be
legal
there
be
one
sharp
exchange
by
letter
between
phil
and
david
bruce
over
david
s
refusal
to
have
lunch
with
phil
and
robin
which
david
have
say
would
be
untimely
phil
testily
and
angrily
respond
that
there
could
be
only
one
act
that
he
felt
david
would
really
consider
untimely
and
that
would
be
the
act
of
be
rude
to
a
lady
and
disloyal
to
a
friend
several
day
later
phil
write
david
again
say
he
have
be
hurt
and
baffle
and
tell
him
i
be
always
your
friend
i
apologize
for
stupidly
think
you
could
ever
act
toward
me
out
of
any
motive
but
the
high
kind
there
be
very
few
happy
time
for
me
in
those
month
one
be
when
pamela
berry
come
to
visit
me
over
a
weekend
pamela
be
the
wife
of
michael
berry
later
lord
hartwell
owner
of
the
london
daily
telegraph
she
be
an
intelligent
strong
articulate
woman
with
a
great
wit
a
lead
london
hostess
and
quite
a
political
force
in
england
though
we
be
all
friend
she
be
know
to
prefer
men
so
i
naturally
thought
she
be
more
phil
s
friend
than
mine
but
she
connect
almost
entirely
with
me
during
this
time
it
be
very
reassure
to
have
her
come
stay
with
me
and
express
such
solidarity
during
this
period
my
mother
be
also
very
supportive
although
she
have
to
be
restrain
from
occasional
impulse
to
write
phil
or
get
in
touch
with
him
on
the
theory
that
she
have
a
special
relationship
with
him
which
in
a
way
be
true
but
in
a
more
important
way
be
not
at
one
point
she
sign
a
will
in
which
my
brother
fritz
beebe
and
i
and
a
bank
representative
sign
an
agreement
about
property
go
to
descendant
from
which
i
suppose
we
omit
phil
each
one
of
these
move
be
its
own
trauma
remind
me
of
the
painful
reality
with
which
i
now
have
to
deal
most
of
the
time
i
live
in
a
dream
that
we
would
get
past
this
nightmare
and
that
normal
life
would
somehow
return
new
york
seem
to
be
phil
s
home
base
when
he
and
robin
weren
t
in
puerto
rico
or
at
the
farm
but
he
make
several
trip
to
washington
once
he
have
dinner
with

there
might
be
a
problem
with
his
behavior

often
than

if

telegraph
say
i
be
take
ill

it
be
partly
right
because
i
be
certainly
take
in
a
letter
to
david
astor
in
england
he
spell
out
his
intention
you

about
my

ill
but
i
have
manage
to
start
get

divorce
in
a
rather
turbulent
manner
when
the
divorce
be
through
i
plan
to
marry
a
proper
commonwealth
lady
miss
robin
webb
from
sydney
australia
phil
spread
the
word
far
and
wide
even
apologize
in
some
of
his
routine
correspondence
for
be
late
in
respond
because
i
have
also
be
somewhat
occupy
in
the
earlier
stage
of
the
unfortunate
business
of
get
a
divorce
he
write
to
all
of
our
friend
in
london
and
paris
tell
them
he
be
planning
a
month
long
trip
to
europe
and
would
be
come
with
robin
whom
he
be
go
to
marry
evangeline
bruce
write
me
from
london
that
our
friend
be
dread
the
visit
fear
that
since
they
have
basically
decide
not
to
receive
robin
phil
might
try
to
trap
us
into
lunch
with
him
at
a
restaurant
alone
and
then
they
d
find
her
with
him
and
there
would
be
some
awful
scene
she
also
note
that
isaiah
berlin
be
planning
to
stretch
out
his
hernia
operation
and
recuperative
period
to
cover
the
entire
time
phil
would
be
in
london
evangeline
add
that
phil
s
insistence
on
take
robin
everywhere
lead
them
all
to
speculate
on
whether
he
would
find
a
way
to
smuggle
the
little
woman
into
his
interview
with
the
pm
pam
berry
write
that
they
be
all
dread
the
arrival
of
phil
and
add
i
don
t
think
she
will
find
london
a
very
social
city
i
can
t
believe
the
trip
will
be
a
success
compare
to
all
the
fun
he
be
accustom
to
have
and
have
have
in
the
past
it
be
all
so
sad
and
horrible
i
can
hardly
bear
it
for
you
all
i
will
write
and
describe
the
visit
that
be
if
which
seem
unlikely
i
witness
any
part
of
it
before
go
to
europe
phil
take
robin
with
him
flew
to
california
for
rand
meeting
where
apparently
there
be
vast
discomfort
over
her
presence
at
the
business
related
dinner
then
on
april
they
left
for
london
evangeline
write
me
a
detailed
report
of
what
she
knew
and
have
see
he
seem
tense
and
the
contrary
of
healthy
and
sad
that
particular
morning
it
be
the
one
after
he
have
talk
to
stevie
on
the
telephone
for
his
birthday
and
sort
of
volcanically
tamped
down
apart
from
that
hard
to
tell
we
kept
off
certain
subject
like
divorce
after
minute
or
so
phil
ask
if
i
would
change
my
mind
and
meet
r
i
say
no
and
this
be
the
opening
to
say
why
and
what
i
felt
about
the
blackmail
mutual
friend
have
be
subject
to
in
this
respect
take
it
well
but
heaven
know
how
he
really
take
it
the
grapevine
will
tell
lot
of
thing
he
say
be
so
patently
untrue
pam
can
tell
you
much
more
of
this
since
he
saw
her
time
for
hour
isaiah
too
incidentally
brave
old
isaiah
told
phil
what
he
felt
about
his
financial
behavior
the
etc
etc
and
appear
to
meet
with
reason
argument
but
could
see
a
black
rage
mount
he
be
also
treat
to
many
a
zionist
argument
isaiah
who
have
deliberately
arrange
for
his
surgery
to
be
do
while
phil
be
in
london
with
robin
write
me
phil
telephone
to
me
and
visit
me
twice
in
my
hospital
room
on
the
first
occasion
not
one
word
be
say
about
any
personal
matter
at
all
this
be
queer
but
i
do
not
bring
it
up
neither
do
he
he
be
acutely
nervous
throughout
and
although
he
talk
quite
sanely
and
even
interestingly
about
the
kennedy
etc
i
could
see
that
this
be
not
what
his
mind
be
on
however
i
do
nothing
to
let
him
off
the
hook
and
lay
back
in
my
exhaust
condition
and
smile
wanly
from
time
to
time
and
in
the
end
the
nurse
have
to
ask
him
to
leave
on
the
next
day
he
return
and
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
personal
talk
from
which
i
gather
that
he
do
indeed
want
a
divorce
and
hope
to
see
you
to
discus
it
with
you
etc
he
have
an
iron
control
of
himself
at
the
moment
but
within
some
kind
of
devil
be
certainly
still
at
large
on
the
other
hand
it
be
quite
impossible
to
say
that
he
be
in
any
respect
insane
his
own
account
of
his
incarceration
have
a
wonderful
grim
humour
about
it
i
have
no
idea
whether
what
he
say
be
accurate
it
certainly
didn
t
tally
with
the
account
of
others
but
i
didn
t
practice
any
inquisitorial
method
i
merely
make
clear
my
devotion
to
you
and
left
it
at
that
he
claimed
to
harbour
no
resentment
or
bitter
feel
towards
you
of
any
kind
i
do
not
see
the
lady
nor
be
she
mention
except
very
glancingly
it
be
not
suggest
that
i
should
see
her
and
i
behave
as
if
she
do
not
exist
i
have
no
idea
whether
any
banquet
be
held
or
how
much
entertainment
occur
since
i
really
be
absolutely
out
of
everything
in
advance
of
this
trip
phil
have
plan
for
a
meeting
of
newsweek
s
overseas
correspondent
they
arrive
from
all
over
the
world
to
meet
with
the
editor
in
london
and
he
make
a
speech
to
this
group
demonstrate
yet
again
his
ability
to
function
at
a
high
level
even
in
the
face
of
his
illness
he
begin
his
remark
by
describe
the
company
say
i
have
be
responsible
for
its
affair
for
year
and
for
the
last
year
since
it
become
a
corporation
in
i
have
be
control
owner
of
its
voting
share
there
be
no
mention
of
my
father
or
how
this
come
to
be
or
the
existence
of
me
as
a
minority
owner
of
course
he
end
his
remark
with
some
philosophical
thought
include
a
phrase
about
journalism
s
be
the
first
rough
draft
of
history
which
be
quote
to
this
day
i
be
insatiably
curious
about
the
state
of
the
world
i
be
constantly
intrigue
by
information
of
topicality
i
revel
in
the
recitation
of
the
daily
and
weekly
grist
of
journalism
much
of
it
of
course
be
pure
chaff
much
of
our
discussion
of
how
to
do
it
well
consist
of
tedium
and
detail
but
no
one
yet
have
be
able
to
produce
wheat
without
chaff
and
not
even
such
garrulous
romantic
as
fidel
castro
or
such
transcendent
spirit
as
abraham
lincoln
can
produce
a
history
which
do
not
in
large
part
rest
on
a
foundation
of
tedium
and
detail
and
even
sheer
drudgery
so
let
us
today
drudge
on
about
our
inescapably
impossible
task
of
provide
every
week
a
first
rough
draft
of
a
history
that
will
never
be
complete
about
a
world
we
can
never
really
understand
while
phil
be
in
london
i
try
to
pick
up
the
pace
of
my
life
a
little
my
mother
and
i
together
plan
a
large
reception
at
her
house
for
may
to
which
we
invite
hundred
of
people
mother
call
it
a
show
the
flag
party
a
way
to
assure
people
we
be
still
here
and
still
okay
despite
phil
s
effort
to
take
over
it
serve
its
purpose
on
may
after
go
to
paris
from
london
and
then
on
to
ravello
for
five
day
of
rest
phil
and
robin
flew
back
to
the
state
and
after
take
care
of
some
thing
in
washington
he
and
robin
left
again
for
puerto
rico
i
go
on
see
close
friend
and
go
out
a
little
more
one
person
i
saw
be
david
bruce
to
whom
i
talk
about
my
plan
and
intention
and
my
resolve
not
to
give
phil
a
divorce
unless
he
give
up
at
least
enough
of
his
control
stock
in
the
washington
post
so
that
i
would
have
the
majority
interest
i
m
not
sure
how
i
come
to
this
conclusion
but
i
do
know
that
my
determination
be
total
i
be
not
go
to
lose
my
husband
and
the
paper
and
if
my
husband
be
firm
in
his
decision
to
leave
me
then
i
would
fight
to
keep
the
paper
the
chain
of
event
and
activity
quiet
down
and
an
audible
silence
be
emanate
from
puerto
rico
i
suspect
that
my
not
hearing
much
from
there
meant
that
phil
have
become
depressed
and
indeed
he
have
be
there
hadn
t
cure
his
exhaustion
instead
the
calm
and
inactivity
seem
to
have
give
him
time
to
think
and
add
to
his
depression
when
they
return
to
new
york
from
puerto
rico
on
june
ed
williams
met
them
at
the
airport
and
it
be
ed
s
view
that
phil
be
the
bad
he
have
ever
see
him
really
so
depressed
it
be
like
he
be
paralyze
physically
paralyze
with
almost
an
inability
to
move
it
s
hard
to
sort
out
whether
he
return
intend
to
remain
with
robin
or
break
up
with
her
but
they
do
come
to
washington
and
move
into
a
large
house
on
foxhall
road
a
few
day
later
on
monday
june
phil
consult
both
dr
farber
and
ed
and
in
effect
told
them
that
it
be
all
over
he
want
to
end
the
affair
with
robin
farber
typically
be
again
question
and
indecisive
he
ask
phil
if
he
be
sure
ed
step
in
and
ask
phil
three
question
do
he
want
robin
to
leave
do
he
want
ed
to
ask
her
to
leave
do
he
want
to
come
home
if
i
would
have
him
to
all
three
question
phil
in
an
agony
of
despair
and
depression
answer
yes
poor
robin
take
the
shuttle
to
new
york
and
al
friendly
go
to
spend
the
night
with
phil
in
the
house
on
foxhall
road
the
next
day
phil
s
brother
bill
again
come
up
from
florida
and
stayed
with
him
as
do
fritz
beebe
on
that
same
monday
i
get
a
call
from
al
say
that
phil
want
to
come
back
if
i
would
agree
which
i
do
immediately
on
the
afternoon
of
june
phil
return
to
r
street
and
spent
the
night
have
phil
back
be
a
tremendous
and
tremendously
complicate
relief
for
me
one
of
the
immediate
question
be
whether
i
could
go
through
another
black
depression
with
him
i
knew
all
too
well
what
it
be
like
not
be
able
to
leave
the
house
except
when
he
be
at
his
doctor
s
hour
and
hour
of
intense
talk
hearing
thing
i
wasn
t
sure
i
want
to
hear
or
know
about
all
of
those
year
we
have
labor
through
together
to
get
him
out
of
the
depression
have
result
in
his
leave
me
none
of
my
effort
have
lead
to
a
happy
end
and
i
felt
i
just
couldn
t
assume
once
again
the
heavy
burden
and
responsibility
of
be
his
sole
support
system
clearly
we
need
intensive
outside
help
phil
almost
pathetically
ask
to
be
allow
to
stay
at
home
not
to
go
back
to
chestnut
lodge
which
i
view
as
the
only
option
i
don
t
believe
any
of
us
thought
there
might
be
an
alternative
to
chestnut
lodge
at
the
time
and
in
term
of
phil
s
treatment
i
assume
that
the
psychiatrist
knew
what
they
be
do
and
didn
t
question
whether
the
lodge
be
the
right
or
appropriate
place
or
whether
farber
be
the
right
doctor
this
decision
make
about
whether
to
go
to
chestnut
lodge
or
stay
at
home
be
horribly
painful
make
a
little
less
so
by
ed
williams
and
bill
graham
who
both
felt
phil
should
go
and
by
phil
himself
who
in
the
end
go
sadly
but
willingly
our
loyal
driver
tony
drove
him
to
the
lodge
late
in
the
day
on
june
at
some
point
that
even
when
several
of
us
be
at
the
lodge
with
phil
i
saw
ed
for
the
first
time
since
phil
s
last
illness
have
begin
there
be
a
roomful
of
people
but
on
instinct
i
go
up
to
him
and
very
quietly
thanked
him
for
everything
he
d
do
say
i
can
see
you
do
the
best
for
him
when
i
later
met
with
him
to
go
over
what
have
happen
and
how
he
view
it
all
he
told
me
that
his
one
idea
have
be
to
hold
on
to
phil
what
ed
have
do
be
right
with
his
ability
to
appraise
people
and
situation
he
have
be
very
aware
of
phil
s
mental
state
at
almost
every
turn
and
very
clear
about
his
instability
at
the
same
time
he
be
determine
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
him
under
the
circumstance
ed
s
devotion
to
phil
be
not
unlike
mine
unswerving
and
uncompromising
and
his
behavior
at
this
time
create
a
last
bond
between
us
the
day
after
phil
go
back
to
chestnut
lodge
al
friendly
write
him
at
the
rock
bottom
of
despair
and
against
the
hardest
opposition
conceivable
you
make
the
toughest
decision
possible
when
every
thought
be
an
agony
to
frame
your
mind
remain
the
best
and
most
excite
one
i
know
with
those
resource
how
can
even
you
doubt
that
you
will
succeed
in
what
you
have
to
do
there
will
also
be
the
help
from
the
love
of
more
friend
than
you
know
i
ll
see
you
soon
whenever
you
d
like
me
to
lally
who
be
work
in
the
newsweek
washington
bureau
that
summer
write
about
the
mid
june
event
to
my
mother
whom
she
be
go
to
be
join
in
greece
for
another
yacht
trip
last
night
he
go
in
the
hospital
and
donny
and
i
be
both
so
glum
about
the
future
but
this
morning
i
really
feel
certain
that
he
will
indeed
come
through
it
mummy
seem
greatly
cheer
by
the
last
two
day
during
which
he
s
be
at
home
i
be
greatly
cheer
that
despite
the
fact
that
he
feel
there
be
so
little
to
live
for
at
the
moment
he
have
be
so
incredibly
courageous
strong
and
kind
not
only
do
he
get
rid
of
the
girl
but
he
also
manage
to
dismiss
farber
which
i
think
in
way
be
even
harder
for
farber
be
really
his
only
ray
of
hope
in
the
past
few
day
since
he
told
daddy
that
he
knew
he
could
pull
through
his
depression
and
do
it
without
a
hospital
and
also
that
although
the
word
manic
depressive
might
be
a
very
adequate
description
of
his
past
behavior
they
do
not
necessitate
a
future
cycle
obviously
give
up
farber
meant
give
up
the
hope
of
go
through
the
depression
without
a
hospital
and
also
accept
the
label
of
manic
depressive
i
wince
at
the
thought
of
the
agony
he
must
be
experience
it
must
be
so
frighten
to
realize
that
your
whole
life
be
govern
by
cycle
in
which
you
be
either
irrationally
happy
or
just
as
irrationally
depressed
enough
i
just
hope
so
much
that
somehow
all
this
can
be
cure
or
at
least
help
lally
s
letter
suggests
phil
s
still
positive
feeling
about
farber
although
he
himself
have
dismiss
him
as
his
doctor
indeed
he
be
attach
to
him
partly
i
think
because
farber
espouse
idea
phil
agree
with
and
played
down
any
idea
of
real
mental
illness
perhaps
his
dismissal
of
farber
at
this
point
be
an
indication
of
just
how
low
phil
be
that
he
no
longer
believe
farber
and
knew
the
sickness
would
recur
the
letter
also
reflect
that
at
last
a
name
have
be
give
to
this
illness
to
me
phil
seem
as
usual
to
be
truly
courageous
positive
and
hopeful
in
the
face
of
terrible
anguish
in
a
letter
to
my
mother
he
say
what
seem
for
some
moment
an
end
i
must
now
turn
into
a
begin
with
kay
s
singular
love
with
that
of
the
child
with
yours
with
that
of
my
brother
and
that
of
friend
i
know
i
can
do
it
a
begin
scale
to
decent
human
value
at
least
i
do
so
pray
there
be
a
short
interlude
after
phil

to
the
lodge

occasionally
we
d
play
tennis
or
bridge

very
quietly
and

sometimes
as
many
as
letter
a
day
and
write
them
simply
and
quickly
and
do
a
lot
of
other
thing
on
the
side
everybody
like
him
bob
mcnamara
be
very
good
about
visit
phil
at
chestnut
lodge
one
saturday
morning
i
be
play
tennis
with
bob
s
wife
margy
and
she
told
me
that
bob
have
say
to
tell
phil
he
be
come
to
see
him
later
that
afternoon
i
say
i
d
ask
phil
to
see
if
he
be
up
to
it
but
margy
reply
that
bob
who
thought
it
would
be
good
for
phil
have
insist
on
just
announce
that
he
be
come
it
be
so
typical
of
bob
who
be
work
at
the
defense
department
at
a
feverish
pitch
to
conclude
that
that
be
the
best
approach
and
to
take
time
on
a
saturday
afternoon
to
drive
an
hour
to
chestnut
lodge
phil
demur
but
eventually
agree
to
see
him
phil
and
i
sat
together
on
a
bench
under
a
tree
wait
for
the
long
black
official
limousine
which
eventually
swung
into
the
driveway
i
left
the
two
men
alone
to
talk
bob
s
recollection
of
what
he
say
to
phil
be
goddamn
you
get
out
of
here
come
down
and
help
us
we
need
you
and
phil
say
he
couldn
t
in
effect
say
that
nobody
would
accept
him
bob
assure
him
that
he
knew
more
about
the
defense
department
than
almost
anyone
and
repeat
that
he
should
get
down
there
and
help
out
bob
later
told
me
that
he
say
all
this
partially
because
he
thought
that
s
what
phil
need
to
hear
but
more
because
it
be
basically
true
he
felt
strongly
that
phil
have
an
extraordinary
insight
into
the
nation
and
how
to
deal
with
its
problem
one
thing
bob
recall
be
that
when
he
ask
phil
what
he
should
be
do
to
help
phil
reply
well
the
first
thing
i
ll
tell
you
be
not
to
waste
your
time
come
out
here
although
of
course
it
be
hard
i
be
ecstatic
about
phil
be
back
even
if
in
the
hospital
naturally
i
drop
nearly
all
of
my
activity
include
a
plan
trip
to
europe
to
concentrate
on
him
he
remain
seriously
depressed
but
seem
to
me
to
be
already
quite
noticeably
well
even
after
only
a
week
or
so
at
chestnut
lodge
i
felt
he
finally
have
doctor
who
be
treat
a
real
and
know
illness
and
because
of
that
i
be
able
to
hope
that
we
could
as
i
write
a
friend
surmount
the
difficulty
of
the
last
few
year
although
i
still
na
vely
believe
that
phil
could
and
would
get
well
on
some
level
i
think
even
i
be
begin
to
recognize
that
this
be
wishful
think
i
wasn
t
on
sure
footing
when
it
come
to
what
to
talk
about
with
him
but
advise
one
friend
who
want
to
write
that
he
love
love
at
this
point
and
also
any
sort
of
news
or
political
gossip
that
you
can
think
of
phil
be
full
of
remorse
and
guilt
and
sadness
he
who
hat
to
hurt
people
have
to
begin
to
deal
with
all
the
hurt
his
action
have
wrought
for
me
for
the
child
for
robin
for
himself
it
s
hard
to
imagine
his
frame
of
mind
know
he
have
left
his
home
and
child
have
sent
for
robin
more
than
once
and
then
in
the
end
have
told
her
it
be
over
and
have
come
back
home
to
us
worry
about
his
action
and
what
he
have
do
to
himself
his
life
and
to
all
of
us
be
the
main
thing
on
his
mind
that
plus
the
thought
that
not
only
have
it
happen
but
it
might
happen
again
it
have
finally
penetrate
to
me
that
phil
s
diagnosis
be
manic
depression
but
the
whole
issue
of
treatment
or
indeed
even
what
manic
depression
be
i
didn
t
really
comprehend
although
the
illness
be
now
name
i
didn
t
know
what
its
outcome
usually
be
if
not
properly
treat
with
a
combination
of
drug
and
psychiatry
i
certainly
didn
t
understand
something
that
i
learn
later
from
dr
kay
jamison
the
author
of
an
unquiet
mind
about
her
own
manic
depression
she
have
write
that
it
be
a
lethal
illness
particularly
if
left
untreated
or
wrongly
treat
and
of
course
much
less
be
know
then
lithium
be
only
in
the
experimental
stage
be
use
mostly
in
europe
it
wasn
t
in
clinical
practice
here
electric
shock
treatment
have
be
use
routinely
with
manic
depression
for
decade
and
at
least
should
have
be
consider
for
someone
who
be
severely
depressed
or
severely
manic
though
it
have
improve
considerably
since
the
s
electric
shock
be
still
a
rough
therapy
with
many
case
of
convulsion
lead
to
crack
rib
and
broken
back
it
might
still
have
be
the
prefer
treatment
at
the
time
but
a
place
like
chestnut
lodge
which
pride
itself
on
psychodynamic
or
psychoanalytic
treatment
would
certainly
not
have
use
it
in
any
case
phil
have
a
deep
aversion
to
both
drug
and
shock
treatment
an
antipathy
that
have
be
inculcate
in
him
by
farber
and
reinforce
by
his
have
see
the
negative
effect
on
our
friend
frank
wisner
phil
may
have
be
a
victim
not
only
of
farber
s
peculiar
form
of
psychotherapy
but
of
the
timing
of
his
illness
and
of
his
own
antidrug
attitude
i
don
t
know
whether
there
still
exists
a
branch
of
psychiatry
that
treat
manic
depression
by
shun
drug
and
rely
completely
on
talk
therapy
and
discussion
of
existential
philosophy
but
i
hope
not
i
don
t
believe
you
can
reach
people
in
the
depth
of
depression
or
in
the
height
of
mania
through
mere
talk
it
bother
me
still
that
i
be
so
passive
about
the
nature
of
phil
s
illness
and
so
accept
of
farber
for
so
long
i
m
not
sure
why
i
didn
t
insist
on
more
of
an
explanation
perhaps
i
be
just
hold
on
to
the
na
ve
notion
that
all
would
be
well
i
don
t
think
i
would
have
felt
so
optimistic
have
i
see
something
phil
write
at
that
time
address
to
scotty
reston
but
never
sent
it
be
a
little
essay
on
balance
and
moderation
and
be
middle
of
the
road
all
write
out
in
careful
longhand
this
turn
up
later
in
phil
s
paper
and
i
sent
it
to
scotty
when
i
found
it
it
s
hard

fathom
why
he
address
these
thought
specifically
to
scotty
and
why
he
didn
t
send
them
but
they
reflect
think
that
have
we
know
of
it
might
have
lead
us
all
to
a
different
decision
about
whether
he
be
ready
to
have
a
day
away
from
the
hospital
phil
write
i
find
it
unendurable
to
believe
that
balance
or
moderation
or
middle
of
the
road
represent
human
approach
to
living
similarly
we
be
told
that
all
tough
question
be
matter
of
degree
of
simply
draw
a
line
etc
what
nonsense
it
be
not
just
a
matter
of
degree
involve
in
the
chasm
between
freedom
and
tyranny
nor
just
a
matter
of
draw
a
line
one
be
an
embrace
of
life
as
a
holy
project
the
other
be
a
rejection
of
all
but
the
finite
and
temporal
and
material
balance
or
middle
of
the
road
be
blinder
and
deceiver
that
kind
of
language
inevitably
carry
the
suggestion
that
one
can
finesse
the
problem
through
a
sort
of
vegetable
neutrality
that
be
highly
appropriate
for
turnip
but
not
for
men
get
right
down
to
day
to
day
living
how
much
should
one
pour
into
one
s
work
how
much
save
for
one
s
family
how
much
for
solitary
thought
how
much
for
service
to
one
s
sovereign
or
one
s
god
how
great
be
one
s
duty
to
truth
how
do
we
ration
our
small
supply
of
energy
and
talent
and
character
amongst
all
the
claimant
we
know
that
there
be
no
answer
to
those
question
and
there
could
not
be
without
strip
life
of
its
most
value
meaning
we
know
we
have
to
face
these
and
a
thousand
other
question
again
and
again
sometimes
with
vigor
at
time
with
heavy
fatigue
now
in
hope
again
near
despair
but
always
so
long
as
there
be
any
life
at
all
face
again
and
again
and
again
how
wrong
it
be
to
try
to
banish
all
this
to
pretend
it
doesn
t
exist
by
admonish
balance
as
an
approach

the
middle
of
the

the
man
who
leaf
life
by
the
most
violent
suicide
be
still
at
least
more
honest
than
those
who
choose
suicide
while
living
by
define
away
all
that
be
human
in
life
phil
very
much
want
to
go
to
glen
welby
for
a
break
from
the
hospital
and
have
start
to
work
on
the
doctor
to
obtain
their
permission
there
be
a
sharp
difference
of
opinion
among
the
doctor
at
the
lodge
about
whether
this
be
a
good
idea
but
no
one
ever
ask
me
if
there
be
liquor
or
sleep
pill
at
the
farm
nor
do
i
think
to
mention
the
gun
we
have
there
i
who
certainly
knew
the
farm
be
stock
with
gun
that
phil
use
for
sport
be
completely
delude
by
his
seem
progress
lack
of
visible
depression
and
determination
to
get
well
in
fact
i
be
optimistic
about
his
ability
to
do
so
one
doctor
at
the
lodge
told
a
friend
later
phil
be
determine
to
get
out
and
really
be
unbelievably
masterful
in
his
ability
to
manipulate
people
he
even
get
the
patient
to
take
a
vote
among
themselves
and
he
go
to
them
to
argue
his
case
and
get
them
on
his
side
naturally
they
vote
that
he
be
allow
to
go
during
one
of
his
hospital
stay
phil
have
confide
to
his
friend
and
colleague
jim
truitt
that
when
he
be
sick
he
make
people
dance
the
devil
s
dance
indeed
dr
cameron
once
remark
to
me
that
someone
like
phil
especially
in
his
manic
mood
could
pull
people
into
go
along
in
some
way
with
his
madness
become
part
of
it
when
i
look
back
anne
truitt
say
i
see
phil
as
a
dervish
he
s
go
round
and
round
dance
himself
the
devil
s
dance
and
pull
into
his
orbit
nearly
magnetically
everyone
whom
he
touch
i
see
now
that
we
be
all
enablers
in
the
long
run
not
help
him
in
the
least
in
the
end
even
i
start
ask
people
what
they
thought
i
ask
ed
williams
among
others
and
he
be
very
bother
afterwards
that
he
have
say
yes
phil
should
be
allow
out
my
own
doctor
dr
cameron
who
have
an
office
at
chestnut
lodge
thought
the
whole
idea
of
phil
s
leave
the
hospital
for
a
weekend
at
the
begin
of
august
be
definitely
premature
in
any
event
phil
won
and
i
must
say
i
be
glad
he
want
so
much
to
go
to
the
farm
and
i
get
caught
up
in
think
how
good
it
would
be
for
him
he
love
glen
welby
and
be
always
so
happy
there
the
night
before
we
be
to
go
to
the
farm
i
have
dinner
with
my
neighbor
kay
halle
whose
brother
in
law
be
dr
george
crile
jr
of
the
cleveland
clinic
he
walk
me
home
and
ask
if
phil
be
be
give
drug
when
i
say
no
he
express
surprise
and
told
me
that
accord
to
what
he
knew
drug
be
absolutely
necessary
for
phil
s
future
i
remain
skeptical
that
phil
would
ever
agree
to
drug
give
his
feeling
about
them
but
i
thought
of
pursue
this
when
he
go
back
to
the
lodge
after
our
time
at
the
farm
on
saturday
august
phil
s
driver
picked
him
up
at
chestnut
lodge
and
then
they
come
to
r
street
to
get
me
one
of
the
thing
phil
have
say
he
want
to
do
be
to
work
on
farm
problem
while
he
be
there
so
i
have
ask
buck
nalls
to
come
up
to
the
house
in
the
afternoon
i
remember
that
phil
express
surprise
at
my
have
ask
buck
to
come
no
doubt
have
forgotten
that
he
have
mention
work
on
the
farm
as
one
of
his
reason
for
go
there
we
have
lunch
on
two
tray
on
the
back
porch
at
glen
welby
chat
and
listen
to
some
classical
record
after
lunch
we
go
upstairs
to
our
bedroom
for
a
nap
after
a
short
while
phil
get
up
say
he
want
to
lie
down
in
a
separate
bedroom
he
sometimes
use
only
a
few
minute
later
there
be
the
ear
splitting
noise
of
a
gun
go
off
indoors
i
bolt
out
of
the
room
and
ran
around
in
a
frenzy
look
for
him
when
i
open
the
door
to
a
downstairs
bathroom
i
found
him
it
be
so
profoundly
shock
and
traumatize
he
be
so
obviously
dead
and
the
wound
be
so
ghastly
to
look
at
that
i
just
ran
into
the
next
room
and
bury
my
head
in
my
hand
try
to
absorb
that
this
have
really
happen
this
dreadful
thing
that
have
hung
over
us
for
the
last
six
year
which
he
have
discuss
with
me
and
with
the
doctor
but
which
he
have
not
be
talk
about
in
recent
week
when
he
be
obviously
most
seriously
think
about
it
the
sight
have
be
so
appal
that
i
knew
i
couldn
t
go
back
in
so
i
ran
to
call
buck
and
our
caretaker
william
smith
for
help
they
have
heard
the
gunshot
and
appear
immediately
i
finally
go
back
upstairs
to
my
bedroom
and
use
a
direct
phone
to
the
paper
there
be
a
much
love
phone
operator
name
molly
parker
who
have
be
at
the
post
almost
fifty
year
and
luckily
she
be
there
i
told
her
what
have
happen
and
that
i
need
help
i
make
a
call
to
dr
cameron
and
then
just
sat
and
wait
the
next
thing
i
can
remember
be
the
arrival
of
the
local
police
whom
i
suppose
buck
and
william
have
call
finally
alfred
and
jean
friendly
arrive
bring
don
with
them
don
and
i
walk
along
the
road
console
and
sustain
each
other
what
i
be
agonize
about
be
that
i
have
let
him
leave
the
bedroom
alone
i
can
only
say
that
he
seem
so
much
well
that
i
stupidly
be
not
worried
enough
it
have
never
occur
to
me
that
he
must
have
plan
the
whole
day
at
glen
welby
to
get
to
his
gun
as
a
way
of
free
himself
forever
from
the
watchful
eye
of
the
doctor
and
the
world
he
left
no
note
of
any
kind
i
believe
that
phil
come
to
the
sad
conclusion
that
he
would
never
again
lead
a
normal
life
i
also
think
that
he
realize
the
illness
would
recur
as
kay
jamison
have
write
there
be
a
particular
kind
of
pain
elation
loneliness
and
terror
involve
in
this
kind
of
madness
however
he
himself
define
his
illness
phil
be
well
aware
of
the
damage
effect
of
it
on
others
and
on
him
i
think
he
felt
he
d
do
such
harm
the
last
time
around
that
he
just
couldn
t
deal
with
it
couldn
t
fix
everything
it
be
unendurable
to
him
not
only
that
he
couldn
t
make
any
of
it
right
but
that
he
might
cause
more
hurt
again
i
conclude
all
of
this
only
later
at
the
time
i
could
barely
deal
with
the
reality
of
what
have
happen
and
begin
to
handle
the
shock
to
all
of
us
essentially
i
have
go
through
lose
phil
twice
first
he
left
and
there
be
all
the
embitter
agony
of
that
time
since
christmas
then
to
have
that
horror
over
to
have
him
back
be
an
impossible
dream
come
true
but
that
too
be
now
over
and
a
very
different
kind
of
grief
consume
us
all
it
take
most
of
the
afternoon
before
we
could
leave
glen
welby
al
take
charge
inform
authority
deal
with
the
practicality
see
that
family
and
close
friend
knew
someone
i
suppose
the
local
coroner
come
and
remove
the
body
one
oddly
distinct
vignette
in
my
memory
be
of
a
strange
man
walk
into
the
library
where
don
and
the
friendly
and
i
be
sit
we
look
at
him
puzzle
and
he
say
i
m
from
the
washington
even
star
and
they
sent
me
down
to
check
on
the
story
that
mr
graham
be
dead
i
just
nod
and
al
take
him
out
of
the
room
finally
we
get
into
the
friendly
car
to
go
back
to
r
street
with
don
and
me
sit
together
in
back
about
halfway
to
town
i
ask
the
rhetorical
question
what
s
go
to
happen
to
all
of
us
al
turn
around
and
point
at
me
without
say
a
word
distinctly
meaning
that
i
have
to
do
it
but
the
whole
notion
go
right
past
me
as
do
most
everything
else
that
day
when
we
get
back
to
the
house
some
friend
have
already
arrive
and
more
and
more
gather
finally
there
be
almost
a
wake
of
people
not
one
of
whom
i
can
remember
except
for
lorraine
cooper
i
go
to
bed
late
that
night
after
everyone
have
left
year
later
ed
williams
told
me
that
he
have
come
over
even
later
that
night
he
have
no
idea
at
what
time
and
walk
right
in
the
open
back
door
he
have
gotten
very
drunk
and
be
look
for
me
distraught
he
walk
all
around
the
blacken
first
floor
found
no
one
and
left
the
next
day
the
nightmare
of
the
reality
begin
to
set
in
phil
s
death
be
the
most
unbelievable
and
awful
shock
to
all

child
particularly
the
young

more

his
illness
and
its
implication

steve

the
other

suddenness
of
the
loss

any
preparation
for
an
end
to

difficult

burden
of

whole
issue

more
than
one
will
phil
during
the
height
of
his
last
manic
period
have
write
a
new
one
as
ed
williams
later
say
any
will
lawyer
would
have
be
horrify
by
the
way
i
handle
this
but
if
you
just
operate
simply
from
your
instinct
you
do
well
what
ed
have
do
be
extraordinary
phil
have
begin
push
ed
to
make
a
new
will
that
would
have
give
a
third
of
phil
s
estate
to
robin
who
ed
believe
be
not
the
instigator
of
this
and
may
never
have
know
how
much
she
stood
to
benefit
leave
two
third
in
trust
to
be
divide
among
the
child
at
the
time
ed
thought
that
the
bad
thing
he
could
do
be
to
tell
phil
that
he
wasn
t
go
to
help
him
make
such
a
will
that
in
fact
he
felt
phil
wasn
t
competent
to
do
such
a
thing
he
knew
it
would
spell
the
end
of
their
relationship
in
try
to
hold
on
to
phil
ed
write
the
will
for
phil
but
simultaneously
write
a
memorandum
for
the
file
say
he
didn
t
think
phil
be
competent
to
make
a
will
and
that
he
be
do
it
solely
for
the
purpose
of
retain
a
relationship
with
him
and
exercise
what
influence
i
could
over
him
to
get
him
back
to
his
old
life
just
after
this
will
be
execute
phil
go
back
to
ed
and
want
to
reverse
the
percentage
make
robin
the
recipient
of
two
third
of
his
estate
and
the
child
one
third
this
one
be
never
actually
execute
when
phil
finally
decide
to
leave
robin
and
to
come
home
he
ask
ed
to
destroy
the
rewrite
will
and
it
be
officially
torn
up
in
front
of
witness
but
although
the
robin
webb
will
be
invalid
a
technical
question
remain
do
phil
s
will
have
legal
stand
or
do
he
die
intestate
this
be
resolve
by
a
compromise
whereby
i
give
up
part
of
phil
s
estate
in
favor
of
the
child
which
be
fine
with
me
the
child
eventually
have
to
have
their
own
lawyer
and
after
the
funeral
we
all
have
to
go
to
court
to
deal
with
the
legal
issue
involve
i
will
never
forget
steve
then
only
eleven
dress
up
in
his
little
suit
straighten
his
tie
and
say
i
have
to
go
to
see
my
lawyer
his
remarkable
and
ever
present
wit
be
with
him
even
in
these
darkest
of
hour
as
far
as
i
know
robin
receive
nothing
in
the
end
nor
do
she
ask
for
anything
ever
she
be
carry
away
by
phil
and
only
slowly
must
have
come
to
understand
his
illness
i
believe
that
she
call
to
ask
if
phil
have
left
a
note
but
she
never
reappear
in
the
life
of
my
family
and
she
never
give
an
interview
about
her
relationship
with
phil
she
must
be
a
very
decent
person
i
understand
that
she
married
an
australian
diplomat
and
seem
to
live
a
quiet
life
i
hope
that
she
too
eventually
recover
on
the
day
before
the
funeral
the
board
of
director
of
the
company
met
fritz
suggest
that
if
i
felt
up
to
it
i
should
come
to
the
office
to
say
a
few
word
to
the
director
reassure
them
that
the
company
would
go
on
and
not
be
sell
i
agree
but
be
terrify
i
thought
about
what
to
say
write
it
out
and
even
rehearse
when
the
car
arrive
to
take
me
downtown
lally
in
her
nightgown
and
robe
hopped
in
and
go
along
with
me
for
comfort
and
support
i
still
have
her
touch
and
helpful
handwritten
note
on
what
she
felt
i
should
say
note
that
she
place
in
my
hand
and
which
i
rely
on
in
what
i
say
thank
them
all
deeply
involve
that
give
you
confidence
there
have
be
crisis
and
still
be
one
but
you
know
they
will
carry
on
as
they
have
over
the
past
month
never
expect
to
be
in
this
situation
go
off
to
clear
mind
and
think
about
future
no
change
or
decision
at
this
time
the
paper
will
remain
in
the
family
next
generation
and
be
carry
on
in
tradition
so
well
set
far
thought
it
touch
me
still
that
this
young
girl
who
be
if
anything
more
devastate
than
i
could
scribble
out
this
simple
but
correct
sequence
of
thought
and
jump
in
the
car
in
her
nightclothes
to
put
them
in
my
hand
i
recall
walk
into
the
room
where
the
all
male
board
be
gather
to
a
man
they
look
almost
as
stricken
as
i
be
they
also
seem
to
be
look
at
me
hard
to
decipher
what
be
there
oz
elliott
later
recall
what
i
say
well
than
i
could
you
say
you
appreciate
very
much
how
everybody
have
handle
this
very
difficult
situation
with
professionalism
and
you
just
want
to
say
that
you
knew
rumor
be
around
and
would
be
around
that
the
company
would
be
for
sale
or
that
some
part
of
it
would
be
and
you
say
that
you
want
to
make
it
clear
that
it
be
not
for
sale
no
part
of
it
be
for
sale
this
be
a
family
enterprise
and
there
be
a
new
generation
come
along
knowledge
of
that
new
generation
my
child
be
what
lead
me
however
hesitantly
to
the
decision
i
make
then
to
try
to
hold
on
to
the
company
by
go
to
work
phil
s
funeral
be
on
tuesday
august
in
the
washington
national
cathedral
and
be
so
big
and
so
public
that
in
a
way
it
again
shield
me
from
what
be
really
happen
the
child
and
i
have
all
participate
in
decide
on
the
nature
of
the
service
and
the
selection
of
the
hymn
president
kennedy
attend
he
come
up
the
side
aisle
by
himself
after
everyone
be
seat
the
sun
shone
through
the
stain
glass
window
somehow
illuminate
him
as
he
walk
to
his
seat
one
jolt
occur
when
we
left
for
the
private
burial
others
have
be
to
the
funeral
home
to
make
all
the
arrangement
but
i
didn
t
know
the
detail
i
do
know
from
phil
s
endless
joke
that
he
have
procure
a
plot
in
oak
hill
the
cemetery
across
the
street
from
our
house
it
be
extremely
difficult
to
get
in
the
dean
acheson
the
david
bruce
and
the
john
walker
be
all
planning
to
be
bury
there
and
phil
have
developed
an
enthusiasm
of
an
odd
kind
to
be
bury
there
too
one
night
long
before
he
become
ill
he
come
home
from
a
st
albans
school
board
meeting
and
say
there
be
a
man
on
the
board
who
be
influential
at
oak
hill
and
he
be
sure
we
could
have
a
plot
he
go
on
joking
about
it
say
that
all
i
would
have
to
do
be
to
wheel
him
across
the
street
i
be
deeply
upset
when
we
pull
up
in
front
of
the
burial
site
to
find
that
this
be
not
an
exaggeration
his
grave
be
directly
in
front
of
a
little
chapel
right
across
the
street
from
my
house
where
i
can
see
it
every
day
i
like
this
now
but
in
the
begin
it
disturbed
me
a
great
deal
people
come
home
afterwards
touchingly
people
from
all
over
it
s
funny
how
much
you
care
who
be
there
and
even
somehow
count
the
house
at
a
moment
like
that
for
friend
to
care
and
to
come
mean
something
two
message
come
to
me
from
president
kennedy
the
one
i
receive
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
quote
prime
minister
macmillan
say
that
when
phil
call
on
him
that
summer
he
have
found
him
particularly
attractive
and
interest
the
president
then
say
i
thought
the
service
today
be
appropriate
and
move
especially
the
last
hymn
phil
be
so
helpful
to
me
in
so
many
way
since

have
come
here
we
shall
all
miss
him
greatly
and
i
send
you
and
the
child
my
deepest
sympathy
jackie

write
me
an
eight
page
letter
one
of
the
most
understand
and
comfort
of
any

a
few
day
after

birth
to

who
die
these
day
from
phil
s
death
through
the
funeral
that
we
all
endure
be
as
hazy
to
me
now
as
they
be
then
if
there
be
one
regret
i
feel
one
enormous
fail
it
s
that
i
be
so
overwhelmed
that
i
wasn
t
thoughtful
enough
or
helpful
enough
with
the
child
whose
trauma
be
even
bad
than
mine
phil
be
the
bright
shin
light
in
their
life
each
of
the
four
have
be
through
the
month
of
his
absence
only
to
get
him
back
and
then
to
lose
him
again
lally
and
luvie
at
some
point
begin
insist
that
what
i
need
be
to
get
away
from
everything
they
pressure
me
to
go
back
to
europe
with
them
as
do
my
mother
by
cable
i
felt
it
would
be
impossible
even
apart
from
the
child
there
be
much
too
much
to
do
give
the
will
the
estate
the
company
their
rejoinder
be
that
they
have
already
packed
for
me
and
have
my
passport
and
that
i
be
go
i
finally
agree
to
the
plan
bill
and
steve
bravely
return
to
their
camp
don
stayed
at
his
job
with
scotty
living
at
home
and
spending
a
lot
of
time
at
the
friendly
i
take
off
with
luvie
and
lally
the
day
after
the
funeral
to
join
my
mother
s
charter
yacht
at
istanbul
that
decision
may
have
be
right
for
me
but
it
be
so
wrong
for
bill
and
steve
and
even
for
don
so
wrong
that
i
wonder
how
i
could
have
make
it
would
my
young
boy
have
be
well
off
go
too
would
it
have
be
well
if
i
d
stayed
home
for
them
this
be
for
me
the
most
painful
thing
to
look
back
on
it
s
hard
to
remake
decision
and
even
harder
to
rethink
nondecisions
sometimes
you
don
t
really
decide
you
just
move
forward
and
that
be
what
i
do
move
forward
blindly
and
mindlessly
into
a
new
and
unknown
life
chapter
eighteen
left
alone
no
matter
at
what
age
or
under
what
circumstance
you
have
to
remake
your
life
when
i
come
back
in
september
from
the
trip
around
the
black
and
aegean
sea
to
take
up
my
life
again
there
be
a
great
deal
of
painful
loneliness
only
somewhat
dull
by
work
and
by
the
necessity
of
tend
to
the
child
my
mother
the
business
and
the
task
of
balance
them
all
the
cruise
have
be
a
reprieve
of
sort
it
certainly
take
me
into
another
world
but
i
experienced
it
with
a
mix
of
emotion
the
inner
turmoil
continued
always
in
my
mind
be
the
climax
of
the
year
of
secret
struggle
with
phil
s
illness
the
shock
of
the
suicide
the
loss
and
the
eternal
question
about
why
and
what
next
i
didn
t
talk
with
anyone
intimately
on
the
trip
mostly
i
kept
my
agonize
to
myself
i
couldn
t
stop
relive
the
awful
moment
of
the
gun
go
off
my
spring
up
race
downstairs
and
find
him
the
scene
replayed
in
my
head
until
i
thought
i
might
be
go
mad
it
take
a
long
time
to
get
through
that
to
this
day
a
gun
go
off
or
any
loud
bang
nearby
affect
me
profoundly
yet
on
another
level
life
carry
on
the
trip
be
divert
no
doubt
serve
my
mother
s
purpose
bad
as
it
be
for
my
young
boy
left
behind
for
me
this
be
the
first
of
many
such
trip
in
which
look
around
observe
and
learn
become
almost
addictive
one
vivid
moment
from
the
end
of
this
interlude
take
place
at
a
stopover
i
make
on
my
way
home
to
visit
friend
on
the
island
of
spezos
as
i
be
leave
chip
bohlen
ask
me
you
re
not
go
to
work
be
you
you
mustn
t
you
be
young
and
attractive
and
you
ll
get
remarry
i
say
emphatically
that
i
be
go
to
work
chip
actually
meant
what
he
say
flatteringly
for
a
woman
be
married
be
a
goal
a
way
of
life
at
that
time
certainly
the
most
desirable
one
but
i
wasn
t
think
about
remarriage
at
the
time
i
also
saw
no
contradiction
between
go
to
work
and
whatever
happen
in
my
private
life
i
suppose
that
without
quite
realize
it
i
be
take
a
veil

on
september
the
day
after
i
return
from
italy
i
do
indeed
go
to
work
more
formally
i
be
elect
president
of
the
washington
post
company
at
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
director
on
september
often
i
have
be
ask
how
i
have
the
courage
to
take
over
the
company
and
i
ve
always
reply
that
i
never
saw
myself
as
take
over
anything
or
become
the
true
head
of
the
company
i
have
no
conception
of
the
role
i
be
eventually
to
fill
while
recognize
the
importance
of
control
the
company
and
have
be
willing
to
fight
for
it
i
saw
my
job
now
as
that
of
a
silent
partner
watch
from
the
sideline
as
i
try
to
learn
about
the
company
to
which
i
have
tragically
fall
heir
i
saw
myself
as
a
bridge
to
my
child
and
view
my
role
before
they
could
take
over
as
support
the
strong
men
principally
fritz
beebe
for
the
whole
company
oz
elliott
at
newsweek
john
sweeterman
rus
wiggins
and
al
friendly
at
the
post
and
john
hayes
in
broadcasting
who
be
run
thing
and
learn
what
i
need
to
in
case
some
big
decision
come
to
me
as
the
holder
of
the
a
share
i
na
vely
thought
the
whole
business
would
just
go
on
as
it
have
while
i
learn
by
listen
i
didn
t
realize
that
nothing
stand
still
issue
arise
every
day
big
and
small
and
they
start
come
at
you
i
didn
t
understand
the
immensity
of
what
lay
before
me
how
frighten
i
would
be
by
much
of
it
how
tough
it
be
go
to
be
and
how
many
anxious
hour
and
day
i
would
spend
for
a
long
long
time
nor
do
i
realize
how
much
i
be
eventually
go
to
enjoy
it
all
my
go
to
work
in
the
sense
i
define
it
seem
to
be
the
only
sensible
step
to
take
and
in
some
way
shouldn
t
have
cause
much
astonishment
the
year
with
my
father
and
later
with
phil
be
year
of
absorb
from
them
and
often
with
them
fortunately
for
me
they
both
believe
in
share
what
they
be
do
with
daughter
and
wife
one
strength
i
do
bring
to
the
company
be
some
knowledge
and
appreciation
of
news
and
journalism
i
knew
the
principal
journalist
on
the
post
relatively
well
i
knew
rus
al
chal
robert
and
eddie
folliard
as
old
friend
and
have
spent
my
life
listen
to
talk
about
the
news
and
about
the
company
i
have
some
sense
of
whom
to
listen
to
rightly
or
wrongly
i
felt
competent
to
size
them
up
on
the
other
hand
i
felt
awfully
new
and
raw
and
the
job
even
as
i
have
limited
it
look
very
big
it
seem
like
the
difference
between
watch
someone
swim
and
actually
swim
as
i
write
a
friend
in
late
september
i
be
quake
in
my
boot
a
little
but
try
not
to
show
it
i
felt
terrify
without
phil
i
badly
miss
his
guidance
even
with
all
the
difficulty
of
the
last
few
year
he
have
always
be
there
to
lean
on
though
i
have
learn
a
great
deal
from
him
i
still
felt
insecure
make
my
own
decision
what
strength
i
do
have
derive
from
the
last
grueling
year
when
i
have
have
to
carry
the
burden
at
home
but
it
have
never
occur
to
me
that
he
wouldn
t
be
there
at
all
ironically
at
the
same
time
i
be
wish
he
be
there
all
that
phil
have
be
make
my
job
more
difficult
his
have
do
everything
so
well
and
as
it
seem
to
the
world
so
effortlessly
make
it
even
more
daunt
for
me
not
only
have
i
mythologize
him
but
others
share
the
same
idolatrous
view
which
add
to
my
confusion
everyone
would
come
in
and
weep
on
my
shoulder
about
him
as
time
pass
i
developed
more
perspective
and
realize
that
my
image
of
him
be
at
some
variance
with
the
reality
he
hadn
t
be
as
perfect
as
i
thought
he
have
be
brilliant
and
have
achieve
an
amaze
record
but
of
course
there
be
attendant
problem
my
job
be
make
infinitely
harder
by
compare
myself
not
with
the
real
phil
graham
but
with
my
exaggerated
idea
of
his
ability
and
accomplishment
still
i
didn
t
have
as
much
energy
as
phil
have
have
nor
be
my
interest
as
broad
my
knowledge
nearly
as
deep
or
my
training
as
adequate
as
i
readily
admit
i
certainly
didn
t
feel
in
any
way
equal
to
run
the
post
the
way
he
have
run
it
i
write
to
an
old
friend
that
have
me
at
the
helm
of
the
post
and
newsweek
isn
t
like
have
phil
run
them
but
i
feel
like
the
president
of
the
united
state
who
say
to
congress
i
be
the
only
president
you
ve
get
i
have
to
come
to
realize
that
i
could
only
do
the
job
in
whatever
way
i
could
do
it
i
couldn
t
try
to
be
someone
else
least
of
all
phil
what
i
essentially
do
be
to
put
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
shut
my
eye
and
step
off
the
edge
the
surprise
be
that
i
land
on
my
foot
i
do
so
largely
for
two
reason
one
be
fritz
beebe
and
the
circle
of
men
who
have
serve
phil
so
well
and
who
remain
in
place
to
help
me
the
other
be
luck
fritz
be
a
life
save
presence
to
me
and
to
the
company
he
himself
be
relatively
new
at
business
and
at
medium
have
only
be
at
our
company
for
two
and
a
half
year
much
of
which
he
have
spent
simply
hold
thing
together
and
try
to
counteract
whatever
damage
phil
do
or
try
to
do
during
his
illness
he
also
have
work
hard
to
steer
a
path
between
phil
and
me
in
the
last
several
month
and
then
have
have
to
pick
up
the
piece
after
phil
s
death
and
deal
with
the
legal
complication
he
left
behind
fritz
be
generous
to
me
in
every
way
make
me
feel
comfortable
want
and
regard
we
get
along
easily
because
of
his
understand
and
forgive
nature
one
of
the
thing
fritz
and
i
have
do
between
phil
s
death
and
my
leave
for
europe
be
to
discus
our
role
and
to
decide
on
title
he
suggest
that
he
should
remain
chairman
and
i
should
succeed
phil
as
president
the
title
themselves
didn
t
bother
me
or
even
interest
me
but
i
do
see
that
this
might
entail
his
be
bos
and
my
be
number
two
and
i
want
to
be
clear
i
suggest
that
whatever
the
title
we
be
partner
as
he
and
phil
have
be
appropriately
fritz
ask
how
i
thought
this
would
work
i
m
not
sure
i
reply
any
more
than
i
can
tell
you
at
the
begin
how
a
marriage
would
work
but
maybe
this
will
work
like
a
business
marriage
i
m
not
sure
how
i
dare
to
suggest
equality
consider
my
lack
of
credential
and
i
m
also
not
sure
why
he
accede
to
my
position
which
most
businessmen
of
his
stature
would
have
view
as
unreasonable
even
though
i
be
the
owner
maybe
he
understood
or
i
may
have
explain
that
i
have
live
all
those
month
in
fear
of
lose
the
post
and
didn
t
want
to
end
up
cede
it
away
i
don
t
think
our
relationship
would
have
work
differently
in
any
case
no
matter
what
our
title
there
be
also
considerable
luck
involve
in
my
be
able
to
function
at
all
in
this
new
role
the
company
be
relatively
small
and
it
be
private
both
of
which
help
during
my
first
month
on
the
job
the
groundwork
of
stability
for
the
post
have
be
laid
with
the
purchase
of
the
time
herald
nearly
a
decade
before
revenue
at
the
post
newsweek
and
the
television
station
be
grow
fast
as
be
profit
management
at
each
business
be
steady
this
of
course
be
all
much
clearer
in
retrospect
than
it
be
to
me
at
the
time
we
be
editorially
visible
through
the
post
and
newsweek
both
of
which
matter
to
various
constituency
especially
the
government
and
the
president
we
have
a
solid
base
on
which
to
build
a
firm
financial
footing
if
the
company
have
be
big
or
public
or
less
secure
i
might
not
have
have
the
luxury
of
learn
as
i
do
personally
i
be
lucky
because
i
have
a
demand
and
difficult
but
interest
and
absorb
job
to
try
to
fulfill
i
be
economically
independent
and
despite
my
loneliness
i
be
not
really
alone
we
be
a
family
unit
with
bill
and
steve
still
home
and
lally
and
don
at
college
and
my
mother
nearby
my
brother
and
two
sister
be
also
helpful
along
with
a
core
group
of
friend
i
will
never
forget
the
support
i
felt
from
lally
throughout
these
difficult
day
and
week
she
sent
me
the
most
move
letter
which
i
receive
as
i
get
home
and
just
as
i
go
to
work
there
be
no
use
my
again
reiterate
my
belief
that
you
will
do
very
well
with
the
business
as
we
agree
not
in
a
daddy
way
for
who
else
in
the
world
could
run
thing
with
his
brilliance
and
imagination
yet
in
another
way
your
own
which
in
a
different
way
will
be
just
as
good
your
good
judgment
great
ability
to
get
along
with
people
earn
their
respect
and
discern
their
strength
and
weakness
and
desire
to
follow
thing
up
which
pa
be
quite
unwilling
to
do
do
remember
that
the
begin
of
anything
be
the
bad
trite
but
true
i
think
that
we
will
all
make
it
ensemble
and
try
desperately
hard
to
think
about
st
paul
s
in
all
thing
give
thanks
i
find
that
last
bit
of
advice
much
easy
say
than
do
but
j
essaye
besides
all
of
this
i
have
another
important
asset
in
my
passionate
devotion
to
the
company
and
to
the
post
i
care
so
much
about
the
paper
and
about
keep
it
in
the
family
that
despite
my
lack
of
knowledge
and
feeling
of
insecurity
i
felt
i
have
to
make
it
work
and
so
i
get
down
to
the
job
i
have
very
little
idea
of
what
i
be
suppose
to
be
do
so
i
set
out
to
learn
what
the
post
newsweek
our
television
station
and
the
company
itself
be
about
throughout
the
first
week
i
felt
i
be
wander
around
in
a
fog
try
to
grasp
the
rudiment
who
do
what
when
why
where
and
how
it
s
hard
to
describe
how
abysmally
ignorant
i
be
i
knew
neither
the
substance
of
the
business
and
journalistic
world
in
which
i
be
move
nor
the
process
through
which
these
world
operate
despite
my
father
s
expertise
and
experience
i
knew
next
to
nothing
about
business
and
absolutely
nothing
about
accounting
i
couldn
t
read
or
understand
a
balance
sheet
i
remember
my
complete
befuddlement
and
inability
in
the
begin
to
follow
technical
financial
discussion
the
mere
mention
of
term
like
liquidity
make
my
eye
glaze
over
i
be
also
uneducated
in
even
the
basic
of
the
work
world
how
to
relate
to
people
professionally
how
to
tell
people
thing
that
they
might
not
want
to
hear
how
to
give
praise
as
well
as
criticism
how
to
use
time
to
the
best
effect
thing
that
people
learn
automatically
in
the
workplace
or
in
graduate
school
i
didn
t
know
that
there
be
organization
of
headhunter
who
could
help
you
find
executive
if
you
have
to
go
outside
the
company
that
there
be
well
define
reward
and
incentive
system
which
everyone
but
me
seem
to
know
about
that
there
be
a
system
for
deal
with
people
in
a
hierarchy
that
you
don
t
bypass
executive
but
rather
deal
with
problem
through
them
or
risk
undermine
their
authority
i
stumble
around
the
post
building
talk
to
people
not
realize
that
i
shouldn
t
always
start
with
the
first
person
i
encounter
who
often
turn
out
to
be
the
union
head
or
that
people
would
try
to
use
me
for
their
own
purpose
there
really
wasn
t
anyone
who
could
take
me
by
the
hand
and
teach
me
the
thing
i
need
to
learn
and
how
to
go
about
learn
them
i
fell
into
a
somewhat
mindless
pattern
of
routine
and
try
to
deal
with
issue
as
they
arose
naturally
i
look
to
others
for
advice
and
counsel
two
of
those
who
be
helpful
with
specific
suggestion
be
clare
booth
luce
and
walter
lippmann
clare
give
me
interest
and
useful
guidance
on
how
to
handle
myself
at
work
although
some
of
it
be
peculiar
to
her
and
some
of
it
seem
date
now
much
of
it
be
about
a
woman
in
a
man
s
world
i
take
to
heart
what
she
say
among
other
thing
she
warn
me
not
to
commit
myself
to
be
in
the
office
a
set
number
of
hour
each
week
in
case
it
diminish
with
time
which
it
didn
t
she
also
advise
me
to
have
a
male
secretary
which
i
do
keep
charlie
paradise
who
have
serve
phil
well
for
so
many
year
clare
also
told
me
to
keep
in
close
touch
with
my
correspondence
and
that
when
i
sent
mail
to
some
other
executive
or
staff
person
to
be
answer
i
should
ask
to
have
it
back
to
see
how
it
be
handle
so
that
i
would
know
and
learn
more
help
come
from
walter
lippmann
with
whom
i
have
share
my
concern
about
the
excessive
amount
of
reading
material
i
have
and
how
to
sort
it
all
out
although
he
thought
this
troubled
me
unduly
he
write
me
for
the
time
be
my
advice
would
be
to
devote
an
hour
or
less
to
the
newspaper
before
you
go
to
the
office
concentrate
on
the
post
and
look
at
the
time
only
for
headline
of
story
that
might
not
be
in
the
post
then
instead
of
try
to
study
all
the
strange
subject
that
be
report
make
a
note
of
the
story
in
the
post
or
time
that
interest
you
particularly
and
that
you
want
to
know
more
about
make
a
point
of
call
in
the
reporter
who
cover
it
and
have
him
explain
it
to
you
in
this
way
you
will
kill
two
bird
with
one
stone
you
ll
get
inform
on
the
news
in
a
fairly
painless
way
and
you
will
get
to
know
well
than
you
probably
would
any
other
way
the
people
who
actually
write
the
paper
i
wouldn
t
try
to
worry
out
everything
myself
not
everybody
by
any
mean
understands
everything
and
nobody
expect
you
to
do
that
what
i
knew
be
that
i
be
way
behind
most
people
engage
with
current
issue
on
a
daily
basis
in
general
familiarity
with
these
issue
as
well
as
in
knowledge
of
specific
in
addition
i
be
a
naturally
slow
reader
which
make
for
far
problem
in
get
on
top
of
thing
walter
s
suggest
remedy
be
a
good
one
but
it
would
have
take
much
more
self
confidence
than
i
have
to
ask
reporter
to
brief
me
that
would
have
require
an
assurance
on
my
part
that
i
have
a
right
to
impose
on
them
to
try
to
bring
me
up
to
speed
oveta
hobby
who
have
also
inherit
her
job
as
publisher
of
the
houston
post
company
when
her
husband
die
come
to
see
me
at
newsweek
soon
after
i
go
to
work
she
be
a
personal
friend
of
phil
s
and
mine
and
of
my
parent
before
me
we
have
a
cozy
talk
about
the
obligation
of
a
news
executive
among
which
she
cite
speechmaking
i
say
that
speech
be
go
to
be
outside
my
bailiwick
that
i
wasn
t
go
to
give
any
because
i
simply
wasn
t
able
to
she
respond
equally
dogmatically
say
that
i
have
no
choice
i
would
have
to
learn
to
do
thing
like
that
she
herself
hadn
t
know
many
thing
but
have
learn
i
realize
with
some
dread
that
she
might
be
right
and
that
speechmaking
might
indeed
be
in
my
future
feel
that
i
need
to
do
some
of
the
thing
that
phil
have
do
i
create
an
unnecessarily
rigorous
schedule
go
up
to
newsweek
in
new
york
each
week
for
two
day
my
intention
be
good
the
idea
be
for
me
to
learn
and
for
the
people
there
to
feel
i
care
about
them
and
their
work
today
i
m
not
sure
this
be
a
wise
investment
of
my
time
and
energy
especially
since
it
also
left
bill
and
steve
alone
too
much
newsweek
be
especially
difficult
for
me
because
i
truly
be
an
outsider
the
people
work
there
view
themselves
as
an
autonomous
unit
of
the
company
and
be
happy
to
be
quite
separate
from
washington
except
for
fritz
whom
the
executive
like
they
welcome
the
backing
of
the
washington
post
company
but
not
its
guidance
have
always
felt
uncertain
about
newsweek
i
be
nervous
and
jittery
there
for
me
it
be
the
new
and
the
strangest
part
of
the
whole
company
practice
what
i
later
call
its
own
particular
approach
to
journalism
newsweek
seem
far
from
my
familiar
ground
in
washington
literally
and
figuratively
because
i
didn
t
know
most
of
the
people
who
work
there
nor
they
me
and
because
robin
be
associate
with
newsweek
i
felt
all
the
more
disconnect
from
it
on
my
way
to
europe
right
after
phil
s
death
i
write
to
two
men
whom
i
regard
as
unfriendly
ben
bradlee
and
arnaud
de
borchgrave
i
thought
of
them
as
phil
s
people
phil
s
friend
and
both
of
them
have
stood
clearly
and
decisively
with
phil
for
their
own
good
and
separate
reason
ben
felt
he
owe
phil
loyalty
for
his
purchase
of
newsweek
but
i
think
he
and
actually
most
of
the
people
at
newsweek
simply
didn
t
know
the
washington
post
company
or
feel
any
loyalty
to
anyone
but
phil
himself
when
they
saw
thing
come
apart
they
try
to
cut
a
straight
professional
line
and
separate
phil
from
me
naturally
take
his
side
arnaud
be
a
friend
of
robin
s
from
newsweek
s
paris
bureau
which
make
me
all
the
more
wary
of
him
but
he
played
a
large
and
useful
if
ambiguous
role
abroad
for
newsweek
he
be
a
dash
figure
a
charmer
of
sort
who
knew
many
of
the
monarch
ruler
and
leader
and
a
fine
reporter
and
he
be
good
for
the
magazine
he
also
live
very
well
off
it
what
i
say
to
both
of
them
be
that
the
past
be
past
and
that
i
hop
we
could
all
go
forward
together
ben
doesn
t
remember
receive
such
a
letter
but
i
be
very
clear
about
have
write
to
both
men
i
knew
enough
even
then
to
understand
that
personal
feeling
shouldn
t
enter
into
professional
situation
my
later
relationship
with
ben
of
course
become
one
of
the
most
cherished
professional
and
personal
relationship
of
my
life
and
one
of
the
most
productive
arnaud
remain
more
or
less
distant
from
me
and
seem
to
feel
that
i
be
out
to
get
him
if
i
be
it
take
me
an
inordinately
long
time
since
he
be
at
the
magazine
for
seventeen
more
year
until
he
be
fire
by
the
editor
in
over
an
editorial
disagreement
even
then
when
lester
bernstein
newsweek
s
editor
at
the
time
told
me
that
the
editor
have
unanimously
decide
to
part
company
with
arnaud
i
ask
if
they
be
certain
state
that
arnaud
do
have
a
lot
of
talent
lester
s
response
be
i
come
to
tell
you
not
to
consult
you
yet
despite
all
my
problem
about
the
magazine
miss
dutiful
that
i
be
i
go
to
new
york
early
every
tuesday
morning
stayed
over
tuesday
night
spent
wednesday
at
the
newsweek
office
and
return
late
that
afternoon
this
allow
me
to
attend
the
editorial
meeting
and
conference
on
the
cover
story
for
the
week
i
try
my
best
to
learn
what
make
the
magazine
work
but
i
often
get
quite
depressed
up
there
i
be
constantly
worried
about
perceive
minor
slight
or
awkward
encounter
with
people
i
couldn
t
tell
which
be
valid
worry
and
which
be
not
it
s
understandable
that
i
be
much
more
comfortable
at
the
post
not
only
be
it
in
my
hometown
on
my
own
turf
but
at
the
post
be
people
who
knew
me
and
whom
i
knew
especially
my
dear
friend
rus
wiggins
and
al
friendly
i
be
no
doubt
more
relaxed
with
the
newspaper
because
what
little
work
i
have
do
have
be
on
newspaper
and
i
have
live
through
a
thirty
year
history
of
have
the
paper
in
the
family
but
even
at
the
post
my
road
be
a
bumpy
one
the
whole
start
of
my
work
life
be
a
process
of
nibble
around
the
edge
of
try
to
learn
what
make
editorial
and
business
function
and
how
they
fit
together
it
be
a
difficult
and
lonely
process
i
make
endless
unnecessary
mistake
and
die
over
them
there
be
nothing
to
do
but
feel
my
way
gradually
i
put
thing
into
place
and
begin
to
get
use
to
an
office
routine
become
adjust
to
the
presence
of
secretary
to
answer
mail
to
try
constantly
to
relate
to
people
and
learn
from
them
or
at
least
to
accommodate
myself
to
them
as
they
begin
to
accommodate
themselves
to
me
some
people
at
work
be
shy
around
me
want
to
keep
me
at
a
distance
while
others
want
to
guard
their
turf
some
welcome
my
presence
but
others
view
me
as
an
ignorant
intruder
to
whom
they
have
to
be
patient
and
polite
most
company
employee
probably
go
quietly
about
their
business
not
bother
about
me
at
all
when
people
be
hostile
to
my
arrival
on
the
scene
i
take
it
personally
some
of
the
executive
didn
t
know
how
to
deal
with
a
woman
in
their
midst
particularly
a
woman
who
control
the
company
i
didn
t
understand
sexism
or
anything
to
do
with
it
nor
in
fact
do
many
of
the
men
with
whom
i
work
and
i
be
encumber
by
a
deep
feel
of
uncertainty
and
inferiority
and
a
need
to
please
to
be
like
what
people
really
want
and
need
be
rational
logical
leadership
but
when
i
have
to
decide
something
i
ask
the
advice
of
everyone
i
could
often
irritate
those
closest
to
me
who
felt
understandably
that
i
should
trust
their
judgment
this
seem
to
be
what
happen
between
me
and
john
sweeterman
tension
between
us
increase
from
the
start
and
i
wasn
t
brilliant
at
handle
the
situation
to
say
the
least
i
seem
to
irritate
john
with
all
my
question
i
may
have
be
welcome
by
the
news
and
editorial
side
of
the
paper
but
john
and
the
business
side
didn
t
know
what
to
do
with
me
the
feel
be
mutual
i
knew
it
be
john
who
be
largely
responsible
for
the
paper
s
success
through
his
strategy
business
plan
and
tight
fisted
control
of
the
company
which
be
necessary
in
those
day
john
held
the
purse
string
and
control
the
budget
so
in
effect
he
have
his
hand
in
almost
everything
bill
rogers
the
company
lawyer
always
take
john
s
side
when
i
be
critical
of
him
bill
kept
tell
me
that
john
be
do
a
fine
job
and
that
i
should
appreciate
him
it
be
a
message
i
fail
to
get
at
the
time
but
bill
be
right
what
i
see
now
be
that
john
have
be
give
complete
authority
by
phil
almost
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
in
and
that
phil
have
back
him
firmly
and
completely
his
authority
have
expand
over
the
year
as
phil
grow
less
involve
in
the
day
to
day
operation
of
the
paper
and
particularly
as
he
grow
ill
from
when
he
have
be
make
publisher
but
especially
since
the
onset
of
phil
s
more
pronounce
ups
and
down
john
have
be
the
final
decision
maker
consult
no
one
confer
with
few
about
his
decision
and
here
i
come
along
ask
hundred
of
question
why
do
he
do
this
who
be
in
charge
of
that
how
be
this
be
do
if
john
have
accepted
my
question
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
be
intend
that
i
be
try
to
learn
he
might
have
be
able
to
take
me
in
hand
and
teach
me
and
our
relationship
might
have
go
well
but
he
wasn
t
use
to
woman
in
business
and
particularly
one
as
ignorant
as
i
be
he
have
a
temper
when
cross
and
we
have
a
few
encounter
that
reduce
me
to
tear
and
therefore
make
everything
harder
yet
despite
the
strain
with
john
the
post
and
the
company
continued
to
grow
in
the
year
since
the
purchase
of
the
time
herald
the
paper
have
in
fact
flourish
increase
the
quantity
and
quality
of
news
by
the
time
i
go
to
work
its
circulation
have
reach
more
than
four
hundred
thousand
daily
and
more
than
half
a
million
on
sunday
well
ahead
of
the
star
in
advertising
we
be
now
first
in
washington
our
two
television
station
be
start
to
grow
too
john
hayes
have
run
the
station
in
much
the
same
way
john
sweeterman
ran
the
paper
have
be
give
the
same
kind
of
authority
by
phil
but
hayes
be
more
open
to
me
perhaps
too
because
television
be
completely
strange
to
me
i
stayed
out
of
that
business
more
in
the
begin
and
therefore
didn
t
get
into
his
hair
as
i
do
with
john
sweeterman
also
the
station
be
do
well
than
the
paper
be
and
didn
t
face
the
competitive
or
labor
problem
and
crisis
that
the
post
do
one
persistent
worry
that
begin
as
soon
as
i
go
to
work
have
to
do
with
rumor
that
i
want
to
sell
naturally
right
after
phil
s
death
there
have
be
numerous
offer
to
buy
the
whole
company
many
people
thought
i
would
decide
to
sell
it
rather
than
go
to
work
little
do
they
realize
that
have
live
through
the
rebirth
of
the
paper
from
its
bankrupt
mclean
day
have
stood
by
my
father
and
my
husband
as
they
built
it
up
with
such
zeal
and
devotion
i
would
never
sell
it
be
unthinkable
for
me
but
i
be
descend
on
by
people
try
to
buy
fritz
have
receive
some
offer
even
while
i
be
in
europe
one
from
cbs
through
frank
stanton
which
i
reject
firmly
perhaps
i
overreact
to
these
overture
instead
of
understand
that
we
have
a
desirable
and
vulnerable
look
property
i
regard
the
would
be
buyer
with
outrage
more
or
less
as
vulture
circle
around
my
head
wait
for
me
the
helpless
seem
widow
to
keel
over
because
of
my
insecurity
i
be
unable
to
discus
anything
to
do
with
purchase
offer
coolly
and
all
these
feeler
have
the
unhappy
effect
of
add
to
my
unease
i
remember
meeting
roy
thomson
the
head
of
a
huge
canadian
newspaper
conglomerate
sometime
within
the
first
six
month
of
my
be
at
the
company
he
take
me
by
surprise
by
tell
me
of
send
men
to
scour
america
to
smell
out
medium
property
to
buy
i
actually
recall
quake
when
he
say
there
be
lot
of
reason
why
people
will
sell
a
paper
not
do
well
an
elderly
owner
without
an
heir
a
widow
the
first
real
offer
to
buy
the
company
be
never
formally
deliver
it
come
from
time
mirror
through
john
mccone
then
head
of
the
cia
and
a
friend
of
the
chandler
family
mccone
be
with
scotty
reston
in
the
back
seat
of
a
government
limousine
and
know
that
scotty
be
my
friend
and
would
carry
the
message
to
me
he
told
scotty
of
time
mirror
s
interest
in
acquire
the
post
scotty
actually
answer
for
me
say
that
he
knew
i
wasn
t
interested
in
sell
but
would
let
me
know
of
the
inquiry
the
next
bidder
and
the
most
persistent
be
sam
newhouse
who
offer
million
for
the
company
we
turn
this
down
emphatically
but
newhouse
never
take
no
for
an
answer
and
kept
reappear
with
well
offer
every
time
i
shut
one
door
he
would
enter
through
another
he
begin
to
try
to
approach
us
through
intermediary
one
of
whom
be
clark
clifford
the
last
try
during
that
early
period
be
the
most
amaze
four
month
after
i
go
to
work
ted
sorensen
come
to
lunch
with
me
to
explore
the
possibility
of
his
work
at
the
post
the
idea
of
which
appeal
to
me
he
have
be
a
large
power
in
the
kennedy
white
house
and
be
obviously
able
i
very
much
want
to
think
creatively
on
how
to
attract
ted
we
discuss
job
for
him
in
administration
in
editorial
and
as
a
columnist
he
be
negative
about
everything
until
finally
he
come
forward
with
what
be
actually
on
his
mind
the
only
job
i
really
want
be
yours
he
say
why
don
t
you
move
over
and
let
me
run
the
company
for
you
i
be
startle
but
manage
to
say
that
if
mine
be
the
only
job
he
want
there
be
nothing
more
to
talk
about
a
few
month
later
ted
call
and
ask
if
i
be
go
to
a
particular
party
when
i
say
i
be
he
suggest
pick
me
up
before
the
party
because
he
have
something
to
discus
he
arrive
a
little
early
and
we
sat
down
in
my
library
without
much
hesitation
ted
say
i
be
empower
to
offer
you
a
hundred
million
for
the
post
alone
i
would
run
it
and
you
can
keep
the
rest
i
be
truly
nonplus
i
say
ted
be
this
from
newhouse
after
a
brief
moment
of
play
game
ted
say
that
it
be
but
the
difference
be
that
he
would
be
run
the
post
newhouse
then
operate
his
paper
extremely
tightly
with
small
newsholes
and
large
profit
margin
i
say
you
don
t
really
think
newhouse
would
let
you
run
it
do
you
ted
insist
that
he
would
which
be
suppose
to
appeal
to
me
when
i
say
i
be
surprised
he
would
participate
in
such
an
offer
his
response
be
i
told
you
i
want
your
job
and
in
that
jolly
spirit
we
left
for
the
party
this
be
the
last
offer
of
that
kind
although
there
be
several
more
feeler
in
later
year
for
all
or
part
of
the
company
and
particularly
for
newsweek
we
must
have
reject
half
a
dozen
such
offer
despite
these
adamant
rejection
the
rumor
that
newsweek
be
for
sale
kept
recur
in
print
and
be
damage
to
morale
there
at
the
end
of
my
first
work
year
andrew
heiskell
then
one
of
the
three
head
of
time
inc
and
an
old
friend
take
me
to
lunch
at
where
he
hammer
home
the
point
what
be
you
do
keep
newsweek
you
don
t
know
anything
about
the
magazine
business
and
you
shouldn
t
try
to
be
here
in
new
york
surprisingly
he
didn
t
really
rattle
me
i
have
the
same
fear
he
be
express
but
i
felt
confidence
in
fritz
and
thing
seem
to
be
move
along
not
necessarily
smoothly
but
at
least
in
a
positive
direction
i
told
him
that
though
i
understood
his
point
of
view
i
thought
i
d
stay
my
basic
reason
for
hang
on
to
this
admittedly
precarious
situation
be
the
people
on
the
magazine
it
wasn
t
a
business
motivate
decision
rather
i
thought
we
have
recently
bought
an
institution
involve
many
people
and
to
turn
around
and
sell
the
whole
thing
a
few
year
later
wasn
t
right
i
felt
a
strong
loyalty
to
those
people
and
to
the
organization
although
i
didn
t
always
feel
it
be
reciprocate
there
be
a
lot
of
first
for
me
in
those
early
month
of
my
work
life
i
join
the
board
of
bowater
mersey
as
its
first
woman
director
this
be
my
first
business
board
other
than
be
on
the
company
s
but
it
be
to
be
follow
by
many
others
over
the
year
i
also
replace
phil
on
the
board
of
george
washington
university
i
begin
to
have
lunch
with
others
throughout
the
industry
and
give
my
first
dinner
for
a
business
friend
otis
chandler
as
a
way
of
publicly
show
a
renew
commitment
to
our
work
relationship
with
the
news
service
otis
write
me
afterwards
thank
me
for
the
exquisite
party
and
add
i
know
it
be
not
easy
for
you
at
least
the
ice
have
be
broken
and
thing
like
this
will
come
easy
for
you
from
now
on
as
part
of
get
well
acquaint
with
the
other
division
of
the
company
i
visit
our
two
television
station
in
jacksonville
i
spent
time
with
glenn
marshall
who
ran
wjxt
there
glenn
be
an
early
enthusiast
for
cable
television
which
didn
t
interest
john
hayes
and
i
recall
that
even
on
this
first
visit
i
make
in
my
new
role
he
spoke
about
its
importance
for
the
future
and
the
possibility
of
cable
s
be
the
gateway
to
pay
tv
i
be
too
new
at
my
job
to
be
able
to
participate
usefully
in
the
discussion
so
we
didn
t
make
the
leap
into
cable
at
this
early
stage
i
start
regularly
attend
post
editorial
meeting
and
lunch
which
prove
to
be
the
big
help
to
me
in
comprehend
what
be
go
on
in
the
outside
world
i
begin
to
understand
journalistic
and
political
jargon
the
language
in
which
reporter
and
editor
and
government
official
spoke
i
remember
one
very
early
editorial
lunch
when
i
be
still
painfully
unsure
of
myself
at
which
our
guest
be
madame
nhu
the
sinister
powerful
sister
in
law
of
south
vietnamese
president
ngo
dinh
diem
she
be
justly
infamous
for
her
role
in
that
country
and
widely
fear
and
disliked
this
be
the
first
lunch
at
which
i
ask
a
question
and
i
almost
collapse
from
worry
as
i
summon
up
my
courage
to
ask
it
i
have
no
memory
of
what
i
actually
ask
but
i
have
a
very
vivid
recollection
of
nearly
die
afterwards
from
embarrassment
and
fear
that
i
have
look
stupid
or
ignorant
i
also
distinctly
recall
my
first
lunch
at
the
white
house
in
my
new
role
a
lunch
in
honor
of
president
tito
of
yugoslavia
i
take
with
me
an
election
projection
poll
which
i
give
president
kennedy
on
my
way
out
he
glance
at
it
stuck
it
in
his
pocket
smile
at
me
and
say
oh
so
that
s
the
way
it
s
go
to
be
i
get
a
rapid
introduction
to
another
aspect
of
an
owner
s
or
publisher
s
job
in
october
i
receive
a
call
from
mac
bundy
from
the
white
house
say
that
he
be
in
the
office
with
president
kennedy
they
have
gotten
wind
that
rus
wiggins
be
go
to
be
critical
of
a
trip
that
jackie
be
propose
to
take
on
aristotle
onassis
s
yacht
she
be
go
off
to
recuperate
from
the
birth
and
subsequent
death
of
her
baby
and
the
president
have
ask
franklin
roosevelt
jr
to
accompany
her
rus
view
it
as
a
conflict
of
interest
for
roosevelt
to
be
a
guest
of
onassis
since
roosevelt
be
undersecretary
of
commerce
at
the
time
and
onassis
be
do
business
with
him
i
do
tell
mac
that
i
d
talk
to
rus
but
the
editorial
ran
this
be
the
first
of
many
many
call
i
have
gotten
over
the
year
which
have
give
me
a
lot
of
experience
in
be
the
go
between
between
complainer
supplicant
and
others
of
all
kind
on
the
one
hand
and
editor
at
the
post
or
newsweek
on
the
other
the
editor
be
more
often
right
than
wrong
and
rus
be
clearly
right
this
time
he
stood
by
his
position
and
criticize
the
trip
editorially
the
trip
take
place
anyway
and
life
carry
on
another
strange
and
difficult
first
experience
be
be
an
object
of
interest
throughout
the
medium
and
be
interviewed
this
happen
a
few
time
during
the
first
year
in
one
publish
interview
i
say
i
do
not
find
it
difficult
to
be
a
woman
executive
in
a
field
dominate
by
men
and
after
a
while
people
forget
you
re
a
woman
that
last
be
bravura
brought
on
by
my
newness
and
inexperience
woman
s
issue
hadn
t
yet
surface
and
i
simply
wasn
t
sensitive
to
how
people
view
me
since
i
be
so
painfully
new
and
have
so
much
to
learn
the
unpleasantness
of
be
condescend
to
and
the
strangeness
of
be
the
only
woman
in
so
many
room
get
mixed
up
in
my
mind
but
i
didn
t
blame
my
male
colleague
for
condescend
i
just
thought
it
be
due
to
my
be
so
new
it
take
the
passage
of
time
and
the
woman
s
lib
year
to
alert
me
properly
to
the
real
problem
of
woman
in
the
workplace
include
my
own
i
also
have
my
first
experience
in
a
labor
situation
and
didn
t
do
very
well
the
star
underwent
a
wildcat
strike
by
the
typographical
union
there
be
a
lot
of
grumble
about
how
the
paper
have
fire
a
union
executive
and
our
union
at
the
post
make
it
clear
that
it
hop
we
would
not
support
the
star
s
management
the
washington
newspaper
traditionally
have
negotiate
with
the
craft
union
together
and
we
be
just
decide
to
support
the
star
when
one
even
at
dinner
i
met
jim
reynolds
a
distant
friend
who
be
assistant
secretary
of
labor
represent
labor
of
course
a
fact
i
didn
t
fully
appreciate
you
re
not
go
to
support
the
star
be
you
he
ask
i
say
it
look
as
though
we
be
he
say
how
foolish
that
would
be
and
give
his
reason
i
picked
up
the
phone
and
make
the
mistake
of
passing
this
on
to
john
sweeterman
who
take
it
not
unnaturally
as
my
own
opinion
and
therefore
my
direction
and
drew
back
from
his
plan
to
support
the
star
the
whole
incident
be
very
upset
to
star
executive
who
in
the
end
have
to
give
in
to
the
striker
crosby
boyd
the
star
s
president
come
over
to
see
me
and
say
he
hop
this
be
not
a
new
policy
since
historically
we
have
support
each
other
i
agree
to
continue
our
old
way
this
be
a
lesson
about
the
weight
of
my
voice
i
hadn
t
understood
that
i
could
no
longer
say
something
without
its
carry
a
message
that
i
might
not
want
to
convey
later
when
our
very
survival
be
at
stake
the
star
under
new
ownership
chose
not
to
support
us
i
also
have
my
first
encounter
of
many
with
a
reporter
s
get
into
trouble
with
a
dictator
in
a
foreign
country
usually
over
the
reporter
s
freedom
to
report
in
this
case
it
be
bob
mccabe
who
represent
newsweek
in
hong
kong
he
have
actually
be
jail
in
indonesia
and
i
talk
about
it
with
george
ball
in
the
state
department
who
promise
to
keep
on
top
of
the
matter
and
indeed
do
make
a
statement
to
president
sukarno
this
be
the
first
of
a
series
of
battle
with
dictator
which
go
on
to
this
day
in
which
it
be
always
important
to
let
the
political
leader
know
that
the
organization
and
its
executive
personally
stand
behind
the
reporter
i
make
my
first
business
call
for
newsweek
with
fritz
this
one
on
the
chrysler
corporation
although
this
kind
of
visit
continued
throughout
my
work
life
the
amount
of
good
they
do
be
hard
to
measure
i
do
believe
though
that
in
the
end
know
a
company
s
executive
sometimes
make
a
difference
in
large
advertising
decision
at
the
least
it
establishes
you
as
a
human
presence
a
big
test
for
me
and
another
first
be
a
speech
to
the
newsweek
advertising
sale
meeting
in
puerto
rico
i
vividly
recall
the
terror
of
give
this
first
speech
but
i
have
quickly
discover
that
i
have
no
choice
give
speech
be
part
of
the
job
description
because
my
father
mother
and
husband
have
all
write
their
own
speech
i
wasn
t
aware
of
speechwriter
for
this
particular
speech
i
sat
down
with
my
pencil
and
a
pad
and
write
out
some
thought
of
a
personal
kind
when
i
get
to
the
part
where
i
felt
i
have
to
say
something
about
newsweek
i
be
completely
stuck
and
consult
fritz
who
remind
me
that
emmet
hughes
eisenhower
s
former
speechwriter
who
have
be
hire
by
phil
as
a
newsweek
columnist
be
suppose
to
provide
this
kind
of
assistance
emmet
take
my
start
and
complete
a
speech
that
we
call
i
believe
in
individual
which
i
deliver
on
wobbly
knee
even
reading
from
a
text
take
more
experience
than
i
have
but
the
emotion
of
the
moment
help
me
muddle
through
and
the
speech
be
actually
well
receive
learn
to
create
and
give
speech
be
an
agony
for
a
long
time
emmet
help
me
on
one
or
two
other
occasion
but
finally
refuse
to
go
on
because
i
be
so
hard
to
work
with
i
simply
didn
t
know
when
a
text
be
fine
and
finish
and
when
it
need
more
work
for
year
i
have
no
one
to
help
me
i
go
through
several
speechwriter
but
couldn
t
figure
out
how
to
formulate
with
them
what
it
be
i
need
or
want
to
say
or
to
appraise
the
outcome
meg
greenfield
who
arrive
at
the
post
in
offer
to
help
and
be
essential
to
the
speech
process
for
many
year
it
wasn
t
until
eighteen
year
later
when
guyon
chip
knight
arrive
at
the
post
company
that
the
problem
be
completely

in
any
case

of
these
first
during
that
first
year
of
my
work
life
add
up
and
i
begin
to
realize
that
just
by
put
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
i
actually
be
move
forward
despite
all
the
inner
turbulence
and
confusion
and
despite
my
feel
unsure
that
life
could
really
go
on
without
phil
my
day
be
become
more
endurable
and
even
at
time
interest
again
on
november
i
have
invite
my
old
friend
arthur
schlesinger
and
ken
galbraith
to
have
lunch
with
the
editor
of
newsweek
to
discus
their
view
of
the
back
of
the
book
section
of
the
magazine
i
stop
by
the
white
house
to
pick
up
arthur
who
be
work
there
at
the
time
and
we
flew
to
new
york
and
assemble
for
lunch
with
ken
fritz
and
all
the
top
editor
and
others
concerned
we
be
have
drink
when
someone
come
fly
down
the
hall
stuck
his
head
in
and
say
the
president
have
be
shot
our
reaction
be
disbelief
either
there
be
a
mistake
or
it
would
be
all
right
yet
we
be
panic
stricken
we
rush
to
a
television
set
and
the
report
quickly
make
it
apparent
that
the
situation
be
very
serious
a
secret
service
man
clint
hill
who
have
accompany
jackie
to
india
when

dead
we
move
quickly
to
get
to
the
airport
to
return
to
washington
ken
later
recall
the
contrast
between
the
total
crush
feel
in
the
car
and
the
still
exuberant
noonday
crowd
who
hadn
t
yet
heard
what
have
happen
when
we
get
back
to
washington
we
go
together
to
the
white
house

be
reluctant
to
go
since
i
be
much
less
close
to
the
kennedy
than
either
ken
or
arthur
but
they
both
insist
i
come
with
them
so
i
do
we
go
into
a
room
full
of
people
in
which
ted
sorensen
be
give
order
after

d
be

short
time

up
impatiently
and
ask
everyone
who
didn
t
have
a
specific
job
to
do
and
a
right
to
be
there
to
clear
the
room
at
which
point
i
depart
certain
the
remark
be
aim
at
me
even
though
a
great
many
other
people
left
too
our
sense
of
loss
be
enormous
for
the
country
and
for
so
many
of
us
personally
isaiah
berlin
sum
it
up
best
when
he
later
say
i
feel
less
safe
bill
walton
remember
that
after
help
make
plan
for
the
funeral

to
his
house
shatter
and
my
mother

just
so
straightforward

banana
republic
and
hung
up
the
day
after
the
assassination
i
go
back
to
the
east
room
of
the
white
house
where
president
kennedy
s
casket
be
lie
in
state
and
then
i
go
to
call
on
lady
bird
who
have
invite
me
to
tea
liz
carpenter
who
become
lady
bird
s
press
secretary
later
say
that
president
johnson
suggest
that
she
talk
to
me
like
all
of
us
the
johnson
be
in
shock
at
the
loss
of
jack
kennedy
at
the
same
time
they
be
have
to
take
on
their
enormous
responsibility
as
president
and
first
lady
and
to
take
them
on
with
such
heavy
feeling
as
liz
carpenter
explain
if
you
only
knew
how
awful
we
all
felt
after
the
assassination
not
only
because
we
d
lose
this
golden
president
but
because
it
happen
in
texas
it
be
just
a
hell
of
a
burden
to
bear
lady
bird
described
it
this
way
they
look
at
the
living
and
wish
for
the
dead
she
have
also
spoken
about
what
it
be
like
for
her
to
become
first
lady
i
feel
like
i
ve
walk
on
stage
for
a
part
i
ve
never
rehearse
although
this
be
an
apt
description
for
my
own
new
role
in
life
i
felt
at
a
total
loss
to
be
of
any
help
to
her
we
be
all
so
much
in
shock
that
it
be
hard
to
imagine
any
other
administration
and
any
other
people
in
the
role
of
president
and
first
lady
i
admit
that
i
didn
t
appreciate
at
the
time
that
lady
bird
johnson
would
do
thing
very
well
in
her
own
way
liz
carpenter
also
later
talk
with
me
on
the
phone
about
what
kind
of
program
would
be
right
for
lady
bird
to
undertake
bring
up
the
idea
of
beautification
as
one
possibility
because
i
have
work
for
so
long
on
the
district
s
severe
social
problem
i
worried
that
beautification
be
too
superficial
liz
wisely
say
that
lady
bird
have
to
choose
something
on
which
she
could
have
a
real
impact
liz
be
right
and
the
beautification
program
be
a
triumph
happily
for
me
lady
bird
ask
me
to
be
a
member
of
her
beautification
committee
and
i
be
delighted
to
serve
whoever
follow
john
kennedy
would
have
have
a
difficult
time
certainly
a
new
era
have
begin
on
december
less
than
two
week
after
the
assassination
and
before
the
johnson
have
move
into
the
white
house
joe
and
susan
mary
and
i
be
invite
to
dinner
by
the
president
and
lady
bird
as
we
walk
into
the
entrance
hall
of
the
elm
we
saw
the
portrait
of
sam
rayburn
hang
just
to
the
left
the
president
spoke
of
how
much
he
lament
that
rayburn
and
phil
weren
t
there
at
this
moment
when
he
most
need
their
advice
my
memory
of
the
even
be
spotty
jack
valenti
be
present
and
i
think
we
four
be
the
only
guest
susan
mary
remember
that
the
president
be
in
a
friendly
gentle
mood
which
she
say
be
astonish
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
soon
told
us
over
cocktail
he
have
be
have
a
very
rough
day
because
what
he
call
the
kennedy
men
have
come
one
by
one
to
present
their
resignation
to
him
he
also
talk
about
what
have
happen
in
dallas
he
described
sit
with
lady
bird
in
a
room
at
the
hospital
wait
to
hear
the
news
from
the
operating
room
he
couldn
t
remember
what
the
room
look
like
except
that
it
be
small
and
there
be
a
lot
of
sheet
in
it
twice
lady
bird
have
left
to
see
if
she
could
help
jackie
who
be
stand
alone
in
the
hall
but
she
have
come
back
and
report
that
jackie
prefer
to
remain
alone
it
be
while
they
be
still
in
the
room
with
the
sheet
that
someone
susan
mary
thought
it
be
kenny
o
donnell
come
in
and
say
mr
president
the
president
be
dead
then
johnson
stop
talk
about
the
event
of
november
and
begin
tell
texas
story
it
be
an
unusual
night
by
the
begin
of
i
have
get
a
bit
of
a
start
on
my
job
but
on
a
personal
level
i
be
lonely
life
alone
have
to
be
figure
out
single
life
be
hard
to
resume
after
twenty
three
year
of
marriage
i
be
miserable
every
time
i
do
another
thing
alone
that
phil
and
i
have
do
together
or
any
time
i
enter
a
place
that
flood
me
with
memory
for
age
i
couldn
t
look
at
anything
of
phil
s
especially
his
handwrite
or
personal
object
as
quickly
as
i
could
i
do
over
his
room
both
at
r
street
and
at
the
farm
for
a
while
the
association
with
glen
welby
be
so
gruesome
that
i
want
to
walk
away
from
it
but
i
have
to
remember
that
the
child
didn
t
have
that
horrible
scene
in
their
head
for
them
glen
welby
have
no
negative
association
they
love
the
place
and
everything
about
it
so
i
kept
go
there
although
i
rebuilt
that
bathroom
so
that
nothing
be
in
the
same
place
and
change
thing
around
so
that
i
wasn
t
so
spook
every
time
i
walk
into
the
house
for
me
always
glen
welby
be
the
essence
of
phil
it
be
his
pond
his
field
his
fishing
his
hunt
his
dog
in
short
his
creation
it
be
the
place
where
we
have
spent
so
much
time
together
and
it
be
the
place
that
be
so
inspire
by
his
presence
not
to
speak
of
be
the
scene
of
his
death
i
remain
lonely
in
most
place
especially
when
i
go
to
new
york
people
be
generous
about
hospitality
but
i
hat
be
alone
in
hotel
at
first
i
be
painfully
shy
but
because
i
found
it
so
hard
to
be
alone
i
begin
go
out
a
great
deal
social
life
quickly
become
spoil
and
fun
for
me
i
start
to
see
more
people
in
new
york
include
truman
capote
the
paleys
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
jock
whitney
and
the
james
fosburghs
babe
paley
s
two
sister
be
betsey
whitney
and
minnie
fosburgh
as
well
as
pamela
churchill
hayward
and
her
charismatic
husband
leland
in
washington
i
also
begin
to
see
more
and
more
people
advertiser
or
business
type
related
to
the
paper
a
combination
of
friend
new
and
old
in
journalism
and
government
from
both
party
it
be
washington
at
its
best
look
back
i
be
appalled
at
how
much
i
go
out
i
have
grown
up
with
my
own
parent
go
out
all
the
time
so
i
suppose
it
be
easy
for
me
to
slip
into
a
pattern
of
do
the
same
or
travel
a
lot
without
the
child
first
with
phil
and
then
on
my
own
somehow
after
his
death
i
didn
t
think
to
change
the
pattern
i
didn
t
realize
that
i
should
have
work
harder
to
make
more
time
for
the
child
though
my
go
to
work
have
definitely
make
it
easy
for
me
to
resume
life
after
phil
s
death
it
certainly
make
it
harder
for
bill
and
steve
in
effect
they
lose
both
parent
at
once
up
to
that
time
i
have
be
a
fairly
present
mother
attend
school
function
drive
team
to
sport
event
try
to
be
back
in
the
afternoon
when
the
kid
get
back
from
school
all
that
be
mostly
over
now
though
i
try
to
be
with
them
as
much
as
possible
at
least
get
to
some
of
their
school
occasion
i
faithfully
attend
bill
s
and
steve
s
football
game
and
take
the
boy
with
me
to
event
when
i
could
although
undoubtedly
not
enough
in
different
way
they
be
both
have
a
hard
time
billy
lead
a
typical
teenage
life
at
st
albans
but
at
home
he
live
very
largely
behind
his
close
door
steve
have
the
hardest
time
of
all
too
old
to
be
left
with
a
baby
sitter
yet
not
old
enough
to
be
on
his
own
a
gift
boy
steve
be
not
a
jock
as
his
old
brother
have
be
and
as
the
st
albans
school
formula
call
for
like
don
he
have
skip
a
grade
a
disastrous
idea
for
both
of
them
which
don
have
warn
against
for
steve
when
it
be
suggest
by
the
school
in
fact
st
albans
be
probably
the
wrong
school
altogether
for
steve
in
addition
because
it
be
all
so
painful
to
me
i
have
found
phil
s
illness
and
death
difficult
to
talk
about
even
to
the
child
which
must
have
add
to
their
own
heavy
burden
at
first
i
didn
t
talk
about
phil
at
all
i
just
shut
the
door
a
mistake
with
an
impact
on
all
of
us
lally
somewhat
assuage
my
guilt
about
bill
and
steve
by
write
me
yes
of
course
it
s
ghastly
for
billy
and
stevie
but
i
still
believe
so
firmly
that
they
be
oh
so
lucky
moi
aussi
to
have
have
him
for
a
father
even
if
it
be
only
for
eleven
or
fifteen
year
because
even
if
i
try
desperately
hard
to
be
objective
i
find
them
both
rather
perfect
and
certainly
think
that
so
much
be
due
to
pa
and
above
all
to
you
and
pa
together
on
the
social
scene
one
thing
that
happen
be
that
i
begin
to
be
ask
out
on
date
my
principal
suitor
be
adlai
stevenson
who
turn
up
increasingly
in
my
life
it
s
hard
to
judge
exactly
where
i
ranked
among
all
his
lady
friend
for
my
part
i
be
always
fond
of
him
and
admire
but
i
be
not
at
all
enamor
of
him
i
didn
t
share
the
breathless
enthusiasm
my
mother
and
daughter
and
many
other
lady
have
for
him
i
use
to
get
impatient
with
his
indecision
a
mutual
friend
the
british
economist
barbara
ward
told
me
that
i
have
to
understand
him
and
be
more
patient
but
i
found
it
difficult
perhaps
phil
s
ambivalent
attitude
toward
him
have
left
me
with
some
of
his
annoyance
but
i
think
this
be
genuinely
my
own
reaction
nevertheless
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
adlai
he
stayed
with
me
frequently
when
he
come
to
washington
and
we
go
out
in
new
york
too
i
suspect
that
this
be
one
of
the
few
friendship
he
have
with
woman
in
which
there
be
more
enthusiasm
on
his
side
in
the
summer
of
the
national
enquirer
do
a
story
on
the
two
of
us
fuel
all
kind
of
rumor
un
ambassador
adlai
stevenson
be
involve
in
a
romance
that
could
become
the
hottest
political
story
of
the
year
he
be
court
mr
philip
graham
widow
of
the
late
publisher
of
the
washington
post
and
newsweek
magazine
and
the
owner
of
a
chain
of
tv
station
if
mr
graham
should
agree
to
a
wedding
before
the
democratic
national
convention
in
august
friend
of
stevenson
report
that
his
chance
for
the
democratic
vice
presidential
nomination
would
soar
not
only
would
stevenson
gain
an
attractive
wife
but
with
her
would
go
control
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
tv
magazine
newspaper
combine
in
the
u
s
i
sent
the
clip
to
adlai
with
a
bantering
note
joking
i
be
sure
you
didn
t
realize
the
treat
you
have
in
store
for
you
after
all
what
could
do
your
vice
presidential
chance
more
good
than
to
marry
a
tv
magazine
newspaper
combine
i
be
ready
and
wait
but
we
d
well
announce
before
atlantic
city
that
summer
pam
berry
come
over
from
london
to
visit
me
and
follow
some
of
the
political
campaign
so
she
and
i
and
joe
alsop
set
out
for
the
republican
convention
in
san
francisco
on
july
and
lally
join
us
as
the
convention
begin
i
write
my
mother
that
i
knew
of
no
nearer
resemblance
to
the
three
witch
in
macbeth
huddle
around
the
caldron
than
the
thought
of
pam
and
lally
and
me
in
one
establishment
we
be
all
in
a
high
state
of
alarm
about
the
likely
nomination
of
the
extremely
conservative
we
thought
reckless
barry
goldwater
his
view
on
nuclear
issue
disturbed
us
as
do
his
view
on
civil
right
in
addition
he
have
attract
all
the
john
birch
kind
of
republican
goldwater
seem
menace
to
us
at
the
time
but
i
realize
now
that
we
have
a
very
distort
view
of
him
and
an
unfair
one
memorable
for
me
be
a
speech
that
former
president
eisenhower
make
in
which
he
attack
newspaper
columnist
convention
goer
throughout
the
entire
hall
start
booing
the
press
eisenhower
s
theme
be
take
up
by
every
other
speaker
one
man
who
be
second
the
nomination
of
the
vice
president
actually
spat
out
the
word
walter
lippmann
walter
reuther
the
new
york
time
and
pravda
this
brought
down
the
house
with
everyone
cheer
wildly
except
those
of
us
in
the
press
section
who
sat
mournfully
quiet
i
felt
we
be
watch
a
minority
take
over
a
major
party
still
though
i
be
clearly
a
johnson
supporter
i
be
intent
on
keep
the
paper
independent
and
maintain
the
post
s
basic
policy
of
nonendorsement
mac
and
mary
bundy
come
down
to
glen
welby
for
a
weekend
in
late
july
between
the
two
convention
just
a
few
day
afterwards
mac
write
a
memo
for
the
president
on
what
we
have
talk
about
i
didn
t
know
about
this
until
more
than
thirty
year
later
when
it
be
found
in
the
johnson
presidential
library
the
memo
be
interest
for
its
insider
look
both
at
what
mac
and
i
discuss
that
weekend
and
for
its
insight
into
johnson
s
hope
for
an
endorsement
and
the
way
an
administration
dealt
with
the
press
mary
and
i
have
a
delightful
weekend
at
kay
graham
s
in
the
course
of
which
i
told
her
that
it
would
be
a
great
help
if
the
post
would
endorse
us
openly
i
told
her
that
this
seem
only
a
reasonable
request
in
the
light
of
her
violent
comment
on
the
republican
convention
and
on
goldwater
himself
she
ask
me
with
a
smile
whether
i
be
act
for
you
and
i
say
of
course
i
ask
her
whom
else
she
thought
i
would
be
act
for
she
then
told
me
that
if
i
be
a
washingtonian
i
would
know
that
the
washington
post
have
never
give
its
formal
endorsement
to
anyone
and
she
told
me
that
if
any
of
us
at
the
white
house
can
t
tell
whom
the
post
be
for
then
it
must
be
because
we
can
t
read
i
told
her
in
reply
that
just
because
the
post
have
never
endorse
someone
it
ought
to
begin
now
when
the
stake
be
so
high
and
the
issue
so
clear
but
i
get
no
commitment
my
very
strong
impression
be
that
kay
graham
need
a
little
personal
attention
from
you
not
from
her
but
from
other
people
in
the
post
newsweek
establishment
i
have
heard
snippy
remark
to
the
effect
that
harry
luce
the
arch
republican
seem
to
be
more
welcome
around
the
white
house
than
people
who
have
support
the
kennedy
johnson
administration
of
the
time
i
find
that
the
parable
of
the
laborer
in
the
vineyard
do
not
do
much
good
with
such
people
it
be
not
the
most
persuasive
of
the
parable
for
most
of
us
my
suggestion
be
that
you
might
ask
kay
to
come
for
lunch
or
an
informal
dinner
some
day
on
the
same
basis
that
harry
luce
come
the
last
time
if
you
ask
her
and
then
ask
her
to
bring
any
three
or
four
of
her
people
from
either
the
magazine
or
the
newspaper
i
think
a
lot
of
good
can
be
do
i
know
that
a
lot
of
these
individual
be
not
your
favorite
but
i
cannot
help
think
that
if
we
can
swing
the
chamber
of
commerce
we
ought
to
be
able
to
handle
the
busy
liberal
especially
as
kay
herself
be
very
sensible
when
she
hears
both
side
mac
offer
the
president
three
option
work
out
a
lunch
work
out
an
informal
dinner
let
it
wait
a
while
lbj
chose
the
last
someone
else
have
put
a
handwritten
note
on
the
memo
before
it
go
to
the
president
say
that
bundy
have
be
show
how
many
time
i
have
be
invite
to
the
white
house
in
the
last
six
month
those
occasion
have
include
a
luncheon
for
queen
frederika
of
greece
a
dinner
for
the
prime
minister
of
denmark
a
luncheon
for
woman
doer
that
i
d
regret
and
a
lunch
for
newspaper
publisher
as
it
happens
just
two
day
after
mac
s
memo
have
go
to
the
president
i
write
to
senator
goldwater
in
my
effort
to
bend
over
backwards
to
be
fair
in
the
paper
and
in
newsweek
i
want
to
ensure
that
we
be
not
give
him
short
shrift
i
know
you
knew
my
husband
philip
graham
and
regret
very
much
that
i
don
t
know
you
i
would
like
very
much
to
come
to
see
you
on
a
get
acquaint
basis
if
you
should
have
a
few
minute
within
the
next
few
week
i
will
call
your
office
to
see
if
this
be
possible
we
would
also
like
to
have
you
to
lunch
here
at
the
paper
or
at
newsweek
or
both
if
possible
and
i
feel
it
would
help
us
in
our
coverage
of
your
campaign
if
you
could
do
one
here
i
would
be
glad
to
have
the
newsweek
editor
down
in
the
meantime
i
want
to
say
to
you
how
very
much
it
have
be
my
desire
and
will
continue
to
be
my
desire
to
cover
the
campaign
as
fairly
and
objectively
as
we
can
of
course
i
include
the
three
part
of
the
washington
post
company
when
i
say
this
the
post
itself
newsweek
and
the
television
station
here
and
in
jacksonville
when
i
use
the
word
fairly
and
objectively
i
realize
how
difficult
this
be
to
achieve
at
all
and
how
differently
too
it
can
be
view
i
would
appreciate
it
very
much
if
you
would
send
any
difference
of
opinion
on
this
subject
to
me
at
once
should
they
arise
or
we
would
also
be
glad
to
cooperate
with
you
or
your
staff
in
any
way
you
feel
we
can
help
insure
complete
and
accurate
reporting
these
be
not
idle
word
as
i
believe
very
deeply
that
we
in
control
of
news
medium
have
a
solemn
obligation
to
this
kind
of
news
reporting
and
that
much
depends
on
our
ability
to
fulfill
it
nor
be
they
idle
word
i
believe
intuitively
and
the
feel
grow
with
experience
that
the
news
column
have
to
be
fair
and
detach
even
while
recognize
that
there
really
be
no
such
thing
as
objectivity
the
very
act
of
decide
what
be
news
and
what
be
not
involves
the
use
of
judgment
and
editor
should
use
their
best
detach
judgment
to
achieve
fairness
in
news
column
the
editorial
page
and
editorial
view
be
so
completely
separate
from
the
news
column
that
they
sometimes
be
not
even
in
touch
and
certainly
don
t
influence
each
other
the
democratic
national
convention
of
begin
in
late
august
in
atlantic
city
i
take
don
around
with
me
a
good
deal
and
he
get
a
lot
out
of
it
a
former
girlfriend
of
his
be
also
at
the
convention
but
somewhat
to
my
embarrassment
i
have
to
admit
she
be
there
as
part
of
the
human
chain
around
the
auditorium
demonstrate
on
behalf
of
the
mississippi
freedom
party
the
heat
and
humidity
in
atlantic
city
be
intense
and
we
be
all
glad
when
the
week
wound
down
hot
and
tire
we
head
for
the
airport
i
have
with

and

who
be
go
to

of
some
confusion
we
arrive
at
the

an
hour
later
than
the
intend
takeoff
time
and
when
we

force
one
be
drawn
up
at
the

and
our
plane
be

and
we
all
board
the
plane
and
sat
there
melt
in
the
extreme
heat
while
the
airfield
be
shut
down
because
the
helicopter
with
the
president
and
vice
presidential
candidate
aboard
be

land
with
the
temperature
at
a
steam
one
hundred
degree
inside
the

i
agree
by
the
time
we
have
run
over

the
fence
the
president
be
out
of
the

with

be
at
the
end
of
the
line
between
two
park
car
and
the

i
didn
t
think

astonishment
we

back
in
the

to
be
swept
across
what
look
like
a
brown
desert
to
pick
up

huge
inland

his
request
by
now
it
be
dusk
and
quite
cold
in
the
water
the
president
drove
at
breakneck
speed
occasionally
bounce
on
the

always
thought
that

that
many
people
especially
conservative
have
urge
that
he
take
robert
mcnamara
for
vice
president
not
realize
say
johnson
that
mcnamara
be
far
more
liberal
than
they
thought
assume
he
must
be
conservative

the
president
of

by
all
sort
of
game

i
thought
the
speech
very
good
there
be
some
neighbor
in
that
night
for
a
late
dinner
again
the
conversation
range
across
a
lot
of
subject
but
despite
his
talk
on
and
on
lbj
seem
so
preoccupy
that
i
ask
him
if
he
be
worried
about
the
vietnam
situation
which
have
not
yet
be
mention
yes
very
he
reply
without
elaborate
at
one
point
he
turn
to
humphrey
and
say
god
have
a
funny
way
of
take
care
of
thing
i
think
it
s
because
i
always
try
to
do
right
that
night
after
dinner
johnson
and
humphrey
and
some
of
the
staff
who
be
there
at
the
ranch
sat
up
until
a
m
work
on
campaign
plan
we
be
suppose
to
leave
at
the
next
morning
but
our
early
departure
get
push
back
though
when
it
be
decide
we
would
all
go
to
church
in
fredericksburg
about
thirty
mile
from
the
ranch
even
though
this
be
an
unannounced
stop
there
be
a
number
of
reporter
and
camera
it
be
such
a
tiny
church
that
after
the
johnson
take
communion
they
have
to
leave
their
seat
in
the
front
row
and
stand
outside
until
everyone
else
have
take
communion
when
they
return
for
the
end
of
the
service
as
we
return
to
the
ranch
the
president
be
again
at
the
wheel
follow
by
an
increasingly
long
line
of
car
all
head
for
his
old
birthplace
which
have
be
fix
up
as
we
get
out
he
picked
up
the
intercom
and
told
the
secret
service
agent
to
allow
only
photographer
to
follow
us
there
ensue
about
an
hour
and
a
half
of
picture
take
first
at
the
house
then
at
the
old
family
graveyard
then
outside
in
a
field
of
cattle
and
finally
at
the
superintendent
s
cottage
it
be
an
extraordinary
performance
especially
humphrey
s
remark
when
he
step
in
a
cow
flop
oh
mr
president
i
ve
just
step
on
the
republican
platform
lunch
be
order
by
telephone
to
be
ready
in
twenty
five
minute
two
hour
and
several
telephone
call
later
we
finally
all
sat
down
fourteen
strong
to
a
mexican
meal
of
chili
and
tamale
at
which
the
discussion
be
about
get
around
the
dirksen
amendment
in
order
to
preserve
foreign
aid
the
plane
which
we
have
plan
to
board
in
austin
be
told
to
come
to
the
ranch
to
pick
us
up
just
before
we
left
i
ask
for
two
minute
alone
with
the
president
he
take
me
into
his
bedroom
and
sat
me
on
a
chair
while
he
lay
down
on
the
bed
i
then
talk
in
term
i
have
inherit
from
phil
and
in
a
way
i
would
never
have
do
later
and
that
embarrasses
me
now
i
told
him
i
have
the
feel
that
he
thought
my
point
of
view
be
different
from
phil
s
but
that
in
general
phil
and
i
have
agree
i
say
that
much
as
i
admire
and
love
president
kennedy
phil
personally
have
get
along
with
him
much
well
than
i
have
i
also
say
that
i
admire
the
legislation
he
himself
have
get
pass
and
be
for
him
and
want
to
make
sure
he
knew
it
although
we
have
a
policy
at
the
post
against
contribute
to
campaign
it
have
be
follow
loosely
phil
hadn
t
actually
contribute
to
campaign
but
i
have
i
guess
i
forgot
i
be
now
in
the
other
seat
because
i
told
the
president
that
my
mother
and
i
both
want
to
contribute
to
his
campaign
later
i
come
to
believe
that
the
paper
have
to
be
completely
neutral
and
i
decide
never
to
make
another
contribution
to
a
presidential
campaign
in
any
case
the
president
say
he
have
appreciate
our
help
in
the
past
and
add
warmly
that
we
must
see
more
of
each
other
he
didn
t
mention
an
endorsement
say
that
he
understood
i
have
to
run
an
independent
paper
and
give
me
a
goodbye
kiss
publicly
i
maintain
my
independent
stance
throughout
the
campaign
but
privately
and
openly
among
my
friend
i
be
clearly
an
lbj
supporter
my
support
for
him
actually
get
me
in
trouble
with
rus
wiggins
sometime
that
fall
rus
and
i
be
together
with
the
president
chal
robert
in
his
history
of
the
washington
post
report
that
i
told
the
president
that
the
post
would
not
endorse
him
accord
to
chal
when
tear
well
up
in
lbj
s
eye
she
add
oh
we
re
for
you
percent
wiggins
be
appalled
at
her
remark
he
knew
his
bos
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
that
be
partly
true
though
i
have
make
it
clear
to
lbj
from
the
begin
that
we
wouldn
t
endorse
him
i
felt
he
could
read
between
the
line
of
the
paper
and
realize
that
the
post
be
positive
about
his
program
yet
rus
be
right
to
be
upset
that
i
have
say
we
be
for
him
despite
what
he
have
say
to
me
our
stick
to
our
policy
of
nonendorsement
actually
hurt
lbj
deeply
he
couldn
t
understand
how
he
could
have
won
over
so
many
republican
even
right
wing
paper
and
yet
not
have
receive
the
endorsement
of
the
liberal
washington
post
i
m
also
sure
that
he
assume
that
phil
s
old
paper
and
his
hometown
paper
the
paper
to
which
he
have
be
so
generous
would
endorse
him
he
must
have
felt
that
after
all
the
kindness
he
have
show
me
all
the
extra
special
attention
i
would
surely
come
round
and
bring
the
paper
with
me
but
i
not
only
have
inherit
this
policy
of
nonendorsement
for
the
paper
i
believe
in
it
of
course
phil
have
broken
the
policy
in
for
eisenhower
but
that
be
only
for
the
republican
nomination
not
the
election
itself
i
could
have
change
the
policy
to
endorse
lbj
but
rus
didn
t
want
to
and
i
didn
t
do
much
independent
think
yet
nor
would
i
have
like
to
differ
with
rus
over
such
a
big
issue
so
early
in
our
work
relationship
the
fall
campaign
be
in
full
swing
when
scotty
reston
suggest
that
i
go
along
on
the
press
plane
of
each
candidate
for
a
couple
of
day
to
experience
for
myself
what
a
campaign
be
really
like
i
decide
to
do
just
that
so
chal
robert
and
i
join
the
president
s
press
contingent
in
indianapolis
there
we
met
up
with
chuck
robert
of
newsweek
and
the
three
of
us
drove
to
the
center
of
town
where
the
president
be
about
to
speak
from
a
platform
next
to
the
soldier
and
sailor
monument
lbj
be
on
the
high
level
and
we
be
on
a
level
below
with
several
other
press
people
i
be
walk
around
enjoy
the
drama
of
the
scene
when
i
felt
a
tap
on
my
shoulder
and
turn
to
see
agent
rufus
youngblood
i
be
wear
a
shock
pink
wool
coat
so
the
president
have
spot
me
mr
graham
the
president
want
to
see
you
he
say
want
to
see
me
where
i
ask
up
there
he
say
point
to
the
high
platform
i
can
t
go
up
there
i
exclaim
lbj
be
stand
almost
alone
on
the
small
platform
several
yard
above
us
gently
rufus
say
mr
graham
you
have
to
i
climbed
some
step
up
a
ladder
and
stop
when
my
head
be
on
a
level
with
his
platform
and
say
hello
do
you
want
to
ride
with
me
the
president
ask
this
be
not
too
long
after
the
weekend
at
the
ranch
and
for
the
paper
s
sake
i
didn
t
want
to
seem
too
close
to
him
so
i
cautiously
reply
no
mr
president
i
really
can
t
thank
you
enough
for
the
offer
but
i
m
out
here
to
ride
with
the
press
typically
he
tease
you
get
a
boyfriend
on
the
plane
i
say
ala
no
but
i
want
to
get
the
feel
of
the
campaign
and
of
the
reporter
as
they
cover
it
well
he
reply
come
and
see
me
at
the
hotel
in
cleveland
i
carefully
climbed
back
down
the
ladder
and
rejoin
chal
and
chuck
and
we
be
shortly
off
to
cleveland
the
press
plane
be
great
fun
as
be
the
bus
that
follow
the
president
s
motorcade
no
doubt
the
whole
thing
can
quickly
get
tiresome
if
you
have
to
follow
an
entire
campaign
drag
yourself
from
one
campaign
stop
to
another
but
for
me
limited
as
the
experience
be
it
be
constantly
stimulate
it
be
certainly
very
different
from
what
happens
on
today
s
press
plane
where
reporter
have
much
less
access
to
the
candidate
and
his
manager
when
we
arrive
in
cleveland
i
go
up
to
lbj
s
room
the
president
be
lie
on
one
of
the
bed
in
his
suite
and
jack
valenti
be
there
as
well
they
be
talk
about
how
lady
bird
s
train
trip
campaign
swing
through
the
southern
state
be
go
something
displeased
the
president
while
i
be
in
the
room
and
i
become
an
awkward
witness
to
a
scene
i
wouldn
t
soon
forget
he
suddenly
turn
on
jack
and
laid
him
out
savagely
the
unpleasantness
exacerbate
by
be
deliver
in
front
of
a
relative
stranger
it
be
quite
callous
and
inhuman
something
i
have
never
witness
before
or
since
i
have
heard
about
lbj
s
temper
but
have
never
see
it
in
action
jack
however
be
use
to
these
tantrum
and
remain
unflustered
while
i
squirm
i
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
we
go
on
to
louisville
and
continued
the
next
day
to
nashville
end
as
plan
in
new
orleans
where
the
president
s
campaign
group
be
to
meet
up
with
lady
bird
and
her
entourage
who
have
complete
their
southern
swing
by
train
in
order
to
stay
true
to
my
goal
of
some
balance
i
also
rode
along
on
the
goldwater
press
plane
fly
first
to
new
york
and
then
on
to
los
angeles
for
the
night
from
where
we
left
for
a
whistle
stop
tour
to
san
diego
much
as
i
disagreed
with
his
view
goldwater
himself
be
a
charm
man
and
it
be
fun
to
watch
him
speak
to
the
crowd
gather
for
his
quick
campaign
stop

a
month
follow
the
first
anniversary
of
phil
s
death
lally
come
to
me
in
great
excitement
with
her
young
beau
yann
weymouth
to
tell
me
they
be
engage
and
want
to
be
married
in
a
few
month
yann
be
in
architecture
school
at
mit
and
lally
would
be
enter
her
senior
year
at
radcliffe
i
felt
that
they
be
both
awfully
young
but
i
kept
my
concern
to
myself
decide
that
articulate
them
would
do
no
good
and
might
harm
my
relationship
with
lally
and
yann
i
even
write
my
mother
try
to
be
reassure
about
the
marriage
to
a
great
extent
than
i
felt
a
part
of
that
letter
express
both
my
anxiety
and
some
of
my
attitude
about
woman
in
those
day
one
of
my
worry
about
lally
be
that
she
so
adore
her
father
she
might
not
be
able
to
find
someone
who
measure
up
to
him
in
her
eye
the
good
thing
about
yann
be
that
she
not
only
love
him
she
look
up
to
him
in
every
way
mentally
and
morally
he
lead
and
she
follow
give
the
strength
and
will
of
our
girl
this
have
to
be
a
rare
and
lucky
thing
for
her
to
find
i
spent
much
of
november
after
the
president

while
at
the
same
time
immerse
myself
in
plan
for
a
thanksgiving
weekend
wedding
one
interlude
be
an
even
at
the
white
house
that
didn
t
seem
so
funny
at
the
time
as
it
do
today
joe
and
susan
mary
and
i
be
invite
to
a
small

we
be
the

over
the
course
of

bad
mood

coffee

and

the
last
big
event
of
the
year
for
me
be
lally
and
yann
s
wedding
held
in
the
navy
chapel
in
washington
with
the
reception
at
home
felix
frankfurter
have
write
lally
say
that
he
felt
phil

have
want

give
her
away
but
by
that
time
he
be
in
a
wheelchair
from
a
stroke
and
so
it
be
don
who
walk
her
down
the
aisle
she
wore
a
beautiful
mainbocher
dress
give
to
her
by
her
grandmother
although
the
marriage
last
only
a
few
year
out
of
it
come
two
marvelous
child
katharine
and
pamela
weymouth
my
old
granddaughter
chapter
nineteen
for
people
who
lose
a
spouse
the
year
that
immediately
follow
be
horribly
painful
and
so
it
be
for
me
after
the
first
year
however
come
a
more
bearable
kind
of
grief
that
allows
accommodation
to
the
outside
world
the
world
that
just
carry
on
no
matter
what
have
happen
to
you
the
difficulty
of
my
job
remain
enormous
i
still
have
little
idea
of
how
to
relate
to
people
in
a
business
environment
and
no
idea
how
closely
i
be
be
watch
by
everyone
within
the
company
whatever
i
say
or
do
even
my
body
language
sent
a
strong
message
to
people
than
i
realize
in
addition
i
have
spent
a
lifetime
with
dramatically
impressive
people
and
probably
dismiss
as
unimportant
too
many
quiet
unassuming
but
hardworking
people
throughout
the
company
it
take
me
a
while
to
learn
that
certain
people
may
have
important
skill
that
be
not
always
blazingly
apparent
gradually
i
come
to
realize
slow
as
i
may
have
be
that
what
matter
be
performance
that
sometimes
people
might
have
to
be
help
to
develop
and
that
it
take
all
kind
to
make
an
organization
run
properly
i
make
mistake
and
suffer
great
distress
from
them
partly
because
i
believe
that
if
you
just
work
diligently
enough
you
wouldn
t
make
mistake
i
truly
believe
that
other
people
in
my
position
didn
t
make
mistake
i
couldn
t
see
that
everybody
make
them
even
people
with
great
experience
what
i
do
that
i
m
certain
my
male
counterpart
do
not
and
which
be
particularly
torment
be
to
lie
awake
at
night
relive
event
of
the
day
go
over
and
over
certain
scene
wonder
how
i
could
have
manage
whatever
it
be
differently
yet
despite
all
my
insecurity
and
misgiving
i
be
gradually
begin
to
enjoy
myself
and
unconsciously
somewhere
along
the
line
i
seem
to
have
begin
redefine
my
job
and
what
it
be
i
be
do
indeed
within
the
first
month
of
my
new
work
life
the
color
start
return
to
my
face
my
jaw
be
begin
to
unclench
and
what
i
have
once
call
my
initial
girl
scout
type
of
resolve
be
turn
into
a
passionate
interest
in
short
as
i
say
in
a
speech
at
newsweek
i
sort
of
fell
in
love
i
love
my
job
i
love
the
paper
i
love
the
whole
company
as
i
write
frank
waldrop
i
suppose
it
s
odd
to
speak
of
love
the
company
but
all
i
m
do
be
agree
with
colonel
mccormick
when
he
say
a
newspaper
be
a
living
thing
gradually
too
i
begin
to
learn
the
montessori
method
learn
by
do
once
again
become
my
stock
in
trade
one
of
my
great
learn
tool
over
the
year
be
the
trip
i
take
with
various
editor
and
reporter
from
the
post
and
newsweek
these
trip
which
more
than
thirty
year
later
now
number
nearly
as
many
as
the
year
that
have
pass
be
among
the
richest
and
most
reward
of
all
the
many
opportunity
available
to
me
as
head
of
a
communication
company
of
course
i
have
be
to
europe
several
time
with
phil
but
my
first
trip
as
the
executive
rather
than
as
the
spouse
who
often
get
left
out
of
the
most
interest
occasion
be
something
altogether
unusual
it
be
an
around
the
world
venture
with
oz
elliott
and
his
then
wife
deirdre
or
dee
and
i
love
it
the
only
drawback
be
have
to
leave
bill
and
steve
again
this
time
for
six
week
far
too
long
i
may
have
be
the
president
but
i
be
still
a
woman
and
i
recall
be
upset
when
i
receive
a
letter
from
newsweek
s
correspondent
in
hong
kong
bob
mccabe
ask
if
i
really
want
to
be
include
in
stag
lunch
and
substantive
briefing
during
the
trip
naturally
i
want
to
go
i
reply
somewhat
indignantly
since
i
have
be
work
i
never
seem
to
notice
whether
i
be
with
men
or
woman
as
i
happen
to
be
on
this
job
i
obviously
want
to
learn
as
much
as
i
can
some
matter
specific
to
woman
couldn
t
be
avoid
however
as
evidence
by
the
expression
of
horror
on
oz
elliott
s
face
when
i
met
him
in
san
francisco
at
the
end
of
january
i
be
carry
a
large
not
inconspicuous
yellow
and
red
box
with
the
name
kenneth
on
it
for
the
well
know
hairdresser
in
new
york
it
be
the
fashion
in
the
mid
s
to
use
fake
hair
or
fall
over
the
back
of
your
head
with
your
own
hair
combed
over
the
front
which
both
puffed
out
your
hair
and
eliminate
the
need
to
have
it
do
when
you
be
travel
my
box
contain
my
fall
or
wig
pin
to
a
felt
head
shape
inside
on
see
me
oz
announce
firmly
don
t
think
i
m
ever
go
to
carry
that
for
you
i
laugh
realize
how
ridiculous
it
look
and
say
don
t
worry
i
ll
carry
it
myself
that
settle
we
take
off

circulation
of
many
million

one
to
a
large
advertising
agency

big
sign
reading
welcome
mr
philip
l
graham
and
about
eighty
people
mostly
young
woman
who
applaud
as
i
step
inside
a
startle
japanese
display
of
manner
we
have
a
brief
meeting
with
prime
minister
sato
and
within
the
next
few
day
we
also
met
separately
with
kiichi
miyazawa
and
with
yasuhiro
nakasone
both
of
whom
later
become
prime
minister
i
be
abash
to
admit
that
what
i
remember
of
nakasone
from
that
meeting
be
that
he
make
the
list
of
sexy
men
which
dee
elliott
and
i
be
compile
as
we
circle
the
globe
on
february
we
have
an
audience
with
the
emperor
and
empress
this
formal
interview
with
the
sovereign
we
be
told
be
the
first
he
have
grant
to
a
woman
in
her
own
right
despite
the
pomp
and
high
drama
associate
with
the
occasion
the
whole
visit
have
a
musical
comedy
aspect
to
it
before
we
be
escort
into
the
meeting
place
we
be
briefed
by
a
strip
pant
equerry
whom
we
ask
whether
we
should
shake
hand
with
the
emperor
bow
or
what
his
majesty
would
be
very
pleased
to
shake
your
hand
the
attendant
reply
in
a
tone
oz
recall
that
suggest
we
should
treat
the
emperor
as
we
would
any
regular
god
once
briefed
we
trooped
into
a
hideous
audience
room
laden
with
overstuffed
furniture
with
antimacassar
on
the
plush
brocade
covering
the
emperor
and
empress
appear
and
we
all
sat
down
stiffly
with
the
emperor
and
me
on
a
kind
of
love
seat
across
from
oz
interpreter
close
by
for
all
of
us
there
be
a
long
silence
while
we
wait
as
instruct
for
the
royal
to
begin
the
conversation
the
emperor
have
a
way
of
wring
his
hand
and
sort
of
bounce
up
and
down
so
much
so
that
oz
who
be
sit
across
the
room
recall
that
every
time
he
go
up
in
the
love
seat
kay
go
down
what
the
emperor
begin
with
be
the
question
which
be
duly
translate
be
this
your
first
trip
to
japan
mr
graham
i
heard
myself
say
yes
it
s
my
first
trip
and
mr
elliott
s
as
well
but
oz
be
here
during
the
war
uh
er
i
mean
many
year
ago
i
could
almost
feel
oz
try
not
to
laugh
none
of
the
conversation
be
grip
or
important
rather
it
be
stilted
and
artificial
painful
even
after
one
long
stretch
of
silence
i
actually
volunteer
well
your
majesty
we
understand
you
re
interested
in
marine
biology
and
then
told
him
about
oz
s
be
on
the
board
of
the
natural
history
museum
in
new
york
that
topic
too
go
nowhere
we
have
worried
about
how
we
would
know
when
the
interview
be
over
but
quite
abruptly
the
emperor
turn
to
his
wife
they
arose
as
one
we
all
shook
hand
again
with
as
oz
say
later
the
emperor
appear
to
be
so
unused
to
shake
hand
that
he
watch
his
hand
go
up
and
down
to
make
sure
he
get
it
back
and
it
be
over
the
retainer
in
strip
pant
assure
us
the
meeting
be
a
great
success
everywhere
we
go
throughout
asia
vietnam
be
the
principal
subject
of
discussion
after
a
stop
in
hong
kong
we
flew
on
to
saigon
for
a
closer
look
at
the
country
that
would
get
so
much
of
our
attention
over
the
next
decade
we
land
at
an
airfield
that
seem
equally
divide
between
civilian
traffic
and
military
helicopter
and
fighter
a
fantastic
jumble
of
peace

of
a
peculiar
kind
if

visit
to
a
nearby
about
twenty
five
mile
away
base
not
far
from
the
cambodian
border
on
the
top
of
black
lady
mountain
on
the
outer
edge
of
a
patch
of
land
completely
dominate
by
the
viet
cong
but
use
by
the
american
for
radio
communication
with

area
when
we
get
in
the
helicopter
a
bell
uhib
call
a
huey
i
be
startle
to
find
that
we
be
to
sit
on
a
bench
situate
horizontally
in
the
small
cab
of
the
helicopter
which
have
its
side
off
so
that
your
foot
be
on
the
edge
of
the
cab
i
be
right
behind
the
pilot
and
try
to
look
cool
as
though
this
sort
of
thing
be
routine
for
me
when
we
take
off
leave
the
side
or
door
of
the
helicopter
behind
i
held
my
breath
i
be
even
more
startle
at
see
soldier
toward
the
rear
of
each
side
hold
load
machine
gun
we
flew
low
at
about
twenty
five
hundred
foot
over
rice
paddy
and
field
the
single
house
below
us
accord
to
the
major
from
the
army

public
relation
department
who
accompany

to
viet
cong
sympathizer
government
people
live
in
arm
hamlet
surround
by
trench
and
barbed
wire
none
too
soon
we
land
on
a
tiny
helicopter
pad
big
enough
for
only
two
helicopter
the
mountain
be
held
by
special
force
our
adviser
mostly
marine
we
be
met
by
a
steve
canyon
type
figure
lieutenant
saudlin
who
felt
even
then
that
the
relationship
between
the
american
and
the
south
vietnamese
be
frustrate
and
that
it
would
take
at
least
five
year
to
judge
the
result
on
this
mountaintop
there
be
thirteen
american
and
about
a
hundred
south
vietnamese
soldier
the
entire
area
be
lace
with
barbed
wire
and
machine
gun
emplacement
our
guide
claimed
that
they
be
quite
safe
there
though
subject
to
harassment
and
that
the
area
be
actually
surprisingly
peaceful
around
thanksgiving
just
a
few
month
before
cbs
have
do
a
broadcast
from
the
mountaintop
bring
in
roast
turkey
for
the
soldier
a
live
turkey
have
be
drop
in
earlier
and
have
be
grant
a
reprieve
from
the
feast
become
a
pet
of
sort
the
vietnamese
have
hung
a
red
special
service
scarf
around
his
neck
and
now
he
wander
around
as
if
the
entire
zone
be
his
fiefdom
as
we
get
ready
to
leave
one
of
the
resident
soldier
explain
that
when
we
take
off
from
the
mountaintop
the
helicopter
would
drop
sharply
before
rise
i
be
grateful
for
the
warn
which
be
not
enough
to
calm
my
nerve
but
help
me
understand
my
stomach
drop
as
i
watch
the
gunner
crouch
over
their
weapon
until
we
have
left
the
ground
safely
behind
us
only
my
extreme
interest
in
see
more
of
south
vietnam
prevent
me
who
under
normal
circumstance
even
disliked
elevator
from
panic
during
those
helicopter
ride
but
i
get
back
in
to
visit
two
village
in
the
mekong
delta
where
pacification
be
say
to
have
work
we
also
go
to
the
provincial
capital
of
ben
tre
in
kien
hoa
province
and
then
drove
on
to
a
nearby
hamlet
binh
nguyen
where
we
met
with
an
optimistic
and
determine
province
chief
colonel
chou
who
talk
about
how
he
be
building
strength
in
the
hamlet
the
viet
cong
have
be
create
infrastructure
and
develop
people
for
twenty
year
we
be
told
but
the
american
adviser
and
the
south
vietnamese
military
leader
still
felt
they
be
make
progress
only
one
american
colonel
caution
that
the
viet
cong
seem
to
be
everywhere
and
to
be
willing
to
pay
any
price
for
their
inroad
i
be
unsure
how
to
react
to
the
thing
we
saw
heard
and
do
certainly
our
trip
be
circumscribed
by
the
public
relation
officer
who
take
us
around
more
important
my
feel
that
i
knew
very
little
about
the
history
of
the
conflict
and
the
issue
involve
meant
that
i
kept
to
my
normal
approach
of
listen
a
lot
and
question
little
i
also
tend
to
accept
rus
wiggins
s
view
on
the
main
issue
with
which
the
post
wrestle
and
i
knew
how
strongly
he
favor
american
involvement
in
vietnam
my
habit
of
listen
to
what
the
men
in
my
life
say
result
in
my
leave
vietnam
with
much
the
same
view
i
have
when
i
arrive
i
e
maybe
we
shouldn
t
have
be
there
in
the
first
place
even
in
small
number
but
we
be
there
and
there
be
no
choice
but
to
help
the
south
vietnamese
in
their
fight
against
the
communist
guerrilla
as
chal
robert
later
write
of
wiggins
he
be
not
a
mindless
hawk
he
be
repel
by
the
all
out
war
proponent
indeed
rus
be
never
mindless
about
anything
he
thought
long
and
hard
about
the
position
he
take
the
post
gain
a
reputation
for
strong
support
of
american
involvement
in
the
war
and
rus
support
lyndon
johnson
on
the
war
throughout
his
presidency
not
because
he
blindly
go
along
with
whatever
lbj
put
forth
but
because
he
believe
that
the
united
state
have
to
use
its
power
to
prevent
the
usurpation
of
legitimate
authority
from
take
place
around
the
world
but
there
be
a
great
deal
that
bother
rus
about
the
predicament
of
vietnam
he
felt
strongly
that
our
advance
knowledge
of
the
assassination
of
diem
the
head
of
a
state
with
which
we
be
allied
create
grave
problem
and
the
spectacle
of
be
a
rotten
and
faithless
ally
in
fact
he
be
always
look
for
an
alternative
to
american
involvement
in
vietnam
that
wouldn
t
destroy
the
international
position
of
the
united
state
government
my
own
position
on
vietnam
continued
to
parallel
rus
s
change
only
very
gradually
as
time
pass
until
i
have
a
son
serve
there
which
give
me
my
own
private
view
and
inside
perspective
on
the
war
and
until
phil
geyelin
arrive
to
take
over
the
editorial
page
and
we
gradually
begin
to
turn
the
editorial
position
of
the
paper
around
we
left
vietnam
on
february
and
after
brief
stopover
in
cambodia
and
thailand
move
on
to
india
for
a
dizzy
few
day
one
of
our
most
astonish
interview
there
be
with
the
white
coat
population
minister
or
at
least
the
coat
have
at
one
time
be
white
and
be
now
a
dirty
gray
he
sat
in
a
dusty
office
at
his
clutter
desk
on
which
be
arrayed
a
variety
of
population
control
device
and
he
kept
pick
up
an
iud
inserter
and
play
with
it
swing
it
and
knock
it
against
his
palm
i
will
never
forget
his
say
many
of
the
lady
when
they
use
the
iud
they
complain
of
headache
but
i
do
not
think
the
headache
come
from
the
iud
rather
i
think
the
headache
come
from
the
in
law
an
all
night
flight
from
new
delhi
take
us
over
burning
oil
field
that
lit
up
the
desert
to
beirut
still
untouched
and
beautiful
the
lebanese
never
cease
argue
about
gamal
abdel
nasser
the
egyptian
strongman
during
our
entire
visit
from
lebanon
we
go
on
to
egypt
where
we
interviewed
nasser
himself
from
which
meeting
an
ugly
misunderstand
ensue
nasser
have
a
reputation
in
the
middle
east
for
play
the
east
against
the
west
with
egypt
benefiting
from
cold
war
conflict
east
german
president
walter
ulbricht
have
visit
cairo
just
the
month
before
and
during
our
interview
we
ask
nasser
if
he
have
be
pressure
by
the
soviet
union
to
invite
ulbricht
nasser
say
no
although
probably
it
be
true
unfortunately
the
issue
of
newsweek
that
appear
a
few
day
after
our
interview
report
just
the
opposite
that
piece
actually
have
no
connection
with
our
interview
and
have
not
be
see
by
me
or
by
any
of
our
newsweek
staff
in
beirut
at
the
time
of
the
interview
we
have
try
to
wire
ahead
a
few
line
from
our
interview
but
they
have
not
arrive
in
time
to
be
include
the
interview
be
report
accurately
in
the
post
a
few
day
later
but
by
then
nasser
have
flown
into
a
rage
call
us
liar
seek
only
to
discredit
us
no
amount
of
explain
help
eventually
i
learn
to
accept
most
such
unintentional
mistake
and
confusion
with
some
grace
and
not
to
take
them
personally
we
flew
home
via
rome
and
london
where
we
mostly
rest
and
partied
in
rome
i
have
a
passing
flirtation
with
an
attractive
italian
journalist
afterwards
pam
berry
encourage
my
little
fling
in
rome
by
write
me
do
be
female
and
free
and
frivolous
from
time
to
time
it
will
be
terribly
good
for
you
in
every
sort
of
way
i
d
be
worried
that
you
would
gradually
immolate
yourself
in
work
but
when
you
walk
into
cowley
street
last
thursday
i
saw
a
huge
difference
though
without
know
why
i
work
as
hard
on
this
trip
as
i
d
ever
work
but
far
from
be
tire
the
whole
experience
be
strengthen
and
i
return
with
more
energy
and
enthusiasm
for
my
job
than
ever
one
trip
i
take
that
summer
be
just
for
fun
and
it
be
that
truman
capote
have
told
me
that
he
be
go
cruise
with
marella
agnelli
the
international
beauty
and
wife
of
gianni
agnelli
the
head
of
fiat
marella
have
charter
a
large
sailboat
for
a
tour
of
the
adriatic
and
through
the
greek
isle
and
be
invite
truman
and
a
group
of
her
friend
or
relation
whom
i
knew
to
be
in
the
international
jet
set
i
have
come
a
fair
distance
in
worldliness
but
not
that
far
so
i
told
truman
that
i
wouldn
t
fit
in
and
would
feel
ill
at
ease
but
eventually
i
accepted
marella
s
invitation
though
with
great
reservation
this
trip
be
different
from
anything
i
d
experienced
before
and
a
reflection
of
my
new
life
it
wasn
t
something
phil
would
ever
have
do
nor
would
i
have
do
it
without
him
and
the
puritan
in
me
worried
about
it
even
then
truman
and
i
decide
to
get
to
our
rendezvous
with
marella
via
london
in
order
to
visit
the

his
sister
buffy
ives

be
relieve
to
be
able
to
tell
him
that
i
couldn
t
because
of
the
marella

on
our
arrival

in
the
upstairs
study
since
it
be
late
and
i
couldn
t
see
whom
adlai
be
talk
with
and
didn
t
want
to
interrupt
i
tiptoed
past
the
room
and
go
to
my
bedroom
at
the
end
of
the
hall
i
be
still
reading
when
the
door
flew
open
and
in
breeze
adlai
full
of
reproach
about
my
not
have
join
him
and
eric
sevareid
with
whom
he
d
be
talk
while
wait
for
me
to
return
adlai
stayed
in
my
room
for
at
least
an
hour
when
he
depart
he
left
behind
his
tie
and
his
glass
so
i
crept
quietly
down
the
hall
to
his
bedroom
and
put
them
in
front
of
his
door
the
next
day
when
i
get
back
to
the
embassy
in
the
late
afternoon
the
butler
answer
the
bell
look
very
glum
and
immediately
ask
me
have
you
heard
about
governor
stevenson
no
i
respond
what
be
it
he
s
dead
be
the
reply
i
be
crush
and
disbelieve
he
have
be
walk
with
marietta
in
the
rare
late
afternoon
british
sunshine
when
he
just
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
fatal
heart
attack
eric
sevareid
arrive
as
i
stood
there
as
do
marietta
and
phil
kaiser
minister
at
the
embassy
who
be
return
from
the
hospital
they
have
go
there
in
the
ambulance
with
adlai
eric
told
me
that
he
thought
adlai
have
look
unusually
tire
several
time
during
their
conversation
the
night
before
adlai
have
lean
back
and
close
his
eye
not
exactly
how
i
have
found
him
later
i
ruminate
think
guiltily
of
the
glass
and
tie
at
his
door
adlai
have
spoken
to
me
as
he
do
to
many
of
us
about
want
to
resign
from
his
position
at
the
united
nation
to
take
a
rest
and
then
go
back
into
private
business
but
i
have
no
idea
how
tire
he
must
have
be
in
many
way
he
be
an
unhappy
man
eric
sevareid
say
on
the
cbs
even
news
a
few
day
later
that
adlai
have
told
him
for
a
while
i
would
just
like
to
sit
in
the
shade
with
a
glass
of
wine
in
my
hand
and
watch
people
dance
marella
s
father
have
also
die
while
we
be
in
london
and
she
have
to
be
in
italy
a
week
longer
than
expect
so
our
plan
change
and
truman
and
i
flew
to
athens
and
depart
in
lonely
splendor
on
marella
s
beautiful
boat
the
sylvia
stock
with
a
great
deal
of
my
favorite
italian
wine
truman
have
with
him
the
galley
of
in
cold
blood
in
the
four
section
that
be
to
appear
first
in
the
new
yorker
sit
for
hour
on
the
back
deck
of
the
boat
in
the
balmy
air
we
discuss
it
all
in
detail
section
by
section
why
he
have
do
what
he
d
do
what
the
murderer
be
like
what
garden
city
kansa
be
like
the
character
of
the
detective
and
the
judge
his
own
life
while
in
kansa
we
finally
met
up
with
marella
and
the
other
guest
and
set
off
on
a
route
base
partly
on
a
book
by
freya
stark
lycean
shore
our
goal
be
to
go
down
the
southern
coast
of
turkey
at
that
time
almost
undeveloped
the
boat
wasn
t
big
enough
for
all
of
us
and
on
top
of
that
be
un
air
condition
which
make
life
somewhat
difficult
in
the
extreme
heat
that
set
in
but
marella
herself
be
casual
and
generous
and
uncomplaining
and
the
entire
voyage
be
a
happy
interlude
of
r
and
r
in
an
otherwise
turbulent
year
when
i
have
first
go
to
work
at
the
post
i
assume
that
thing
would
carry
on
as
they
always
have
one
area
that
surprisingly
start
to
shift
under
my
foot
be
the
post
s
editorial
quality
i
hadn
t
realize
that
the
post
wasn
t
perfectly
okay
as
it
be
i
have
great
faith
in
al
friendly
as
manage
editor
and
in
rus
wiggins
as
editor
lead
the
editorial
page
and
basically
believe
that
all
be
well
in
fact
almost
a
year
to
the
day
after
phil
s
death
i
write
al
a
personal
letter
say
you
must
know
without
this
word
but
i
want
to
say
it
anyway
that
you
ve
do
so
well
for
this
year
and
be
so
great
one
of
the
first
people
to
put
into
my
head
the
idea
that
the
paper
wasn
t
all
that
it
should
or
could
be
be
scotty
reston
who
on
a
visit
to
glen
welby
ask
don
t
you
want
to
leave
a
well
paper
for
the
next
generation
than
the
one
you
inherit
this
may
not
seem
like
a
startle
question
but
it
be
to
me
i
have
not
consider
that
we
weren
t
make
the
kind
of
progress
that
we
have
in
the
past
or
that
what
we
be
do
wasn
t
good
enough
for
the
s
it
s
difficult
to
recall
how
i
eventually
become
seriously
concerned
about
what
be
happen
on
the
editorial
floor
on
the
news
side
but
there
be
many
signal
and
i
certainly
be
begin
to
think
about
the
direction
the
paper
should
be
take
the
two
people
i
talk
privately
to
about
the
future
be
walter
lippmann
and
scotty
in
truth
i
felt
i
need
scotty
who
be
such
a
close
personal
friend
to
help
me
move
the
paper
forward
and
in
the
summer
of
i
met
with
him
several
time
to
discus
the
possibility
of
his
come
to
the
post
one
of
the
thing
we
talk
about
be
his
concern
over
phil
s
overstep
his
bound
as
publisher
and
we
agree
that
work
with
me
would
be
different
finally
with
fritz
s
help
and
after
consultation
with
walter
and
rus
wiggins
i
offer
him
the
rather
ill
define
job
of
advise
the
paper
editorially
while
continue
his
column
this
be
completely
impractical
but
i
be
unwilling
to
disturb
rus
and
al
to
whom
i
remain
devote
and
grateful
scotty
quite
rightly
reject
this
offer
firmly
but
kindly
and
very
constructively
we
carry
on
without
him
but
gradually
i
have
to
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
problem
how
could
i
tell
i
certainly
didn
t
have
a
sophisticated
judgment
about
the
quality
of
our
news
product
but
i
be
observe
a
great
deal
of
indecision
among
the
executive
follow
by
some
odd
decision
especially
about
people
i
sense
a
certain
lack
of
adrenaline
and
through
the
grapevine
i
heard
talk
of
stagnation
in
the
city
room
one
report
that
reach
me
say
that
you
could
swing
a
dead
cat
around
the
city
room
after
nine
at
night
and
not
hit
anyone
then
there
be
al
himself
bob
man
who
be
work
for
the
government
come
to
see
me
with
the
idea
that
he
replace
al
friendly
that
he
be
what
be
need
to
revitalize
the
paper
i
reject
the
suggestion
out
of
hand
but
that
episode
too
left
a
seed
of
doubt
by
al
have
be
manage
editor
for
ten
year
and
people
be
comment
on
how
he
be
age
he
do
seem
to
be
get
tire
and
he
be
clearly
grow
hard
of
hearing
which
make
difficulty
for
him
on
the
job
he
himself
must
have
felt
some
concern
since
he
decide
he
should
take
two
month
vacation
every
year
he
and
jean
have
bought
a
place
in
turkey
and
want
to
spend
time
there
al
be
my
friend
but
the
manage
editor
be
a
key
figure
who
get
the
paper
out
each
day
and
the
idea
of
two
month
off
worried
me
all
these
be
clear
warn
signal
but
i
be
puzzle
about
what
to
do
about
them
not
only
have
al
do
a
fine
job
with
meager
resource
over
many
year
but
he
and
jean
be
such
close
personal
friend
that
it
be
unthinkable
to
upset
him
when
i
try
to
suggest
to
him
that
the
paper
could
use
some
energize
he
seem
to
dismiss
my
feeling
and
obviously
didn
t
take
my
judgment
seriously
so
i
conceive
the
idea
of
ask
him
to
talk
with
others
particularly
walter
lippmann
to
find
out
what
they
thought
of
the
paper
and
what
he
might
do
to
move
it
forward
he
agree
but
by
then
walter
have
go
to
maine
and
they
couldn
t
get
together
at
that
time
in
the
meantime
i
have
learn
that
ben
bradlee
have
twice
be
offer
promotion
by
newsweek
which
would
have
entail
his
move
to
new
york
but
have
turn
them
down
although
i
have
go
back
and
forth
to
new
york
with
him
on
various
trip
for
newsweek
and
have
have
a
few
meeting
and
lunch
with
him
i
didn
t
know
ben
very
well
i
still
associate
him
with
phil
s
bad
period
when
i
thought
he
have
take
side
but
i
knew
that
he
ran
a
good
bureau
have
good
people
work
for
him
and
be
generally
well
regard
and
i
realize
that
he
be
eminently
hirable
and
worried
about
lose
him
from
the
company
especially
to
some
television
network
which
i
fear
might
recruit
him
since
he
be
good
look
and
appeal
because
i
want
to
discover
what
his
ambition
be
i
invite
him
to
lunch
i
have
never
do
such
a
thing
before
in
those
day
it
be
still
a
little
awkward
i
felt
for
a
woman
to
take
a
man
to
lunch
and
to
pay
the
check
so
in
december
i
take
him
to
the
f
street
club
where
i
could
sign
for
the
bill
those
be
the
pre
credit
card
day
and
avoid
a
scene
about
who
would
pay
so
odd
to
think
of
now
our
talk
meander
around
i
ask
him
why
he
hadn
t
go
to
newsweek
in
new
york
although
i
knew
that
he
and
his
wife
tony
have
six
child
living
with
them
four
of
hers
and
two
of
theirs
apart
from
ben
jr
ben
s
son
from
an
earlier
marriage
which
would
make
change
city
difficult
he
told
me
he
like
run
the
bureau
here
in
washington
and
be
in
no
hurry
to
move
on
but
what
would
you
like
to
do
in
the
long
run
i
ask
well
since
you
ask
ben
respond
with
his
typical
picturesque
language
i
d
give
my
left
one
to
be
manage
editor
of
the
post
i
be
stun
this
be
neither
the
question
he
expect
nor
the
answer
i
anticipate
or
even
welcome
however
give
the
context
of
my
concern
it
be
certainly
a
thinkable
thought
what
i
say
to
ben
be
that
we
could
discus
the
idea
but
not
right
now
or
at
any
time
soon
ben
however
saw
his
opening
and
pursue
it
hard
i
d
see
him
around
and
he
d
say
when
be
we
go
to
talk
some
more
what
be
we
go
to
do
next
i
be
surprised
by
his
tenacity
i
use
the
time
to
check
out
the
idea
with
scotty
who
didn
t
know
ben
personally
but
thought
it
might
work
out
walter
lippmann
who
do
know
ben
react
favorably
say
he
thought
ben
could
do
great
thing
for
the
paper
encourage
by
that
i
take
the
idea
to
fritz
who
heartily
approve
and
to
oz
who
of
course
do
too
ben
and
i
met
several
more
time
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
month
he
make
it
clear
that
he
didn
t
want
to
give
up
a
job
he
love
in
order
to
sit
around
the
post
wait
for
al
to
retire
in
two
or
three
year
he
be
however
willing
to
come
to
the
paper
and
wait
one
year
i
didn
t
like
that
prospect
part
of
me
thought
what
gall
this
guy
have
to
be
so
pushy
when
he
doesn
t
even
have
the
job
but
part
of
me
thought
maybe
this
be
exactly
what
we
need
and
what
i
m
look
for
ben
kept
push
and
i
kept
delay
until
the
early
summer
of
when
i
finally
brought
up
with
rus
and
al
the
idea
of
bring
ben
over
from
newsweek
as
assistant
manage
editor
they
both
react
negatively
at
first
rus
say
he
should
come
in
as
a

have
take
no
vacation
he
left
newsweek
on
a
saturday
and
come
to
the
post
on
the
follow
monday
i
have
write
him
on
july
say
i
have
have
a
nice
note
from
al
tell
me
that
ben
have
learn
more
in
spare
half
hour
than
have
others
in
month
indeed
ben
hit
the
ground
run
then
and
always
ben
be
charismatic
he
be
good
look
in
an
unconventional
way
funny
street
smart
and
political
all
of
which
stood
him
in
good
stead
what
be
also
always
important
be
how
hard
he
work
in
his
determination
to
learn
he
work
into
the
night
and
on
saturday
too
and
what
he
quickly
observe
be
that
rus
be
concentrate
on
the
editorial
page
and
that
al
have
indeed
lose
his
energy
by
default
ben
gilbert
by
control
all
the
screw
and
the
screwdriver
really
ran
the
paper
ben
saw
al
as
not
know
the
basic
of
the
paper
the
various
production
department
and
the
union
for
example
and
felt
that
his
lack
of
knowledge
have
be
to
the
detriment
of
the
post
from
the
begin
ben
saw
that
to
be
a
good
editor
it
be
important
to
know
how
thing
come
together
what
i
hop
be
that
the
issue
of
timing
would
slide
i
couldn
t
see
my
way
around
the
problem
of
move
al
out
and
wish
the
whole
matter
would
quietly
go
away
but
few
thing
regard
ben
be
ever
quiet
that
fall
after
al
and
jean
s
vacation
in
turkey
al
and
i
resume
our
talk
about
the
future
of
the
paper
he
told
me
that
he
have
make
a
lunch
date
with
walter
lippmann
as
i
have
suggest
walter
call
me
too
and
ask
how
far
do
you
want
me
to
go
i
say
as
far
as
he
felt
he
could
at
the
time
suggest
he
just
feel
your
way
by
this
i
meant
and
thought
walter
meant
talk
to
al
about
the
inadequacy
of
the
paper
and
what
we
should
do
to
improve
it
i
have
nothing
else
in
mind
the
phone
rang
after
the
lunch
and
it
be
walter
who
say
well
the
conversation
go
so
well
i
go
all
the
way
have
not
heard
that
expression
since
high
school
i
anxiously
ask
what
do
you
mean
by
all
the
way
walter
well
he
reply
i
told
him
that
these
administrative
job
wore
people
out
and
there
come
a
time
when
they
should
think
about
give
it
up
and
go
back
to
write
i
be
dumbstruck
i
have
no
idea
walter
be
go
to
go
to
that
point
with
al
ben
have
only
be
at
the
paper
for
three
month
and
i
have
no
intention
of
dislodge
al
that
early
i
thought
that
even
ben
who
be
push
be
still
assume
it
would
take
a
full
year
while
i
be
assume
even
longer
unbeknownst
to
me
ben
must
have
be
push
from
other
direction
too
and
talk
about
the
situation
with
al
directly
his
impatience
be
reflect
in
a
letter
henry
brandon
correspondent
for
the
sunday
time
of
london
write
to
his
editor
denis
hamilton
on
october
ben
b
told
me
that
the
situation
with
al
still
in
the
chair
and
him
assign
to
kill
the
sacred
cow
cannot
endure
that
he
will
press
for
a
decision
within
the
next
two
month
press
he
may
have
do
but
i
couldn
t
have
face
my
old
and
dear
friend
and
ask
him
to
step
aside
that
abruptly
however
because
walter
have
indeed
go
all
the
way
and
because
i
really
knew
by
then
that
it
be
best
for
all
concerned
i
go
ahead
with
the
change
so
much
for
my
allege
courage
i
have
barely
hung
up
from
talk
to
walter
when
al
come
into
my
office
look
stricken
and
pale
and
say
be
this
what
you
want
there
be
no
go
back
the
awful
deed
have
be
do
for
me
so
i
just
say
yes
i
m
afraid
it
be
al
with
justice
totally
on
his
side
sadly
say
i
wish
i
d
heard
it
from
you
i
can
t
remember
whether
i
try
to
explain
but
i
do
remember
the
pain
we
both
felt
even
ben
be
surprised
at
how
fast
everything
happen
in
the
end
on
november
it
be
announce
that
he
would
become
manage
editor
of
the
washington
post
succeed
al
there
be
something
in
the
announcement
to
the
effect
that
al
have
ask
to
be
relieve
of
executive
duty
and
to
resume
an
earlier
career
of
reporting
and
write
on
national
and
international
affair
al
become
associate
editor
of
the
paper
continue
as
vice
president
and
a
member
of
the
company
s
board
of
director
the
strain
with
al
and
jean
be
grim
but
they
both
do
their
best
to
be
polite
even
come
to
glen
welby
for
a
weekend
the
miracle
be
that
eventually
al
rebuilt
his
life
as
a
stellar
reporter
luckily
he
own
a
lot
of
stock
in
the
newspaper
and
be
wealthy
so
he
be
able
to
buy
a
flat
in
london
as
well
as
maintain
the
house
in
turkey
and
his
large
home
in
georgetown
most
important
thing
become
too
uncomfortable
here
at
home
he
eventually
go
abroad
to
write
and
report
there
he
do
some
of
his
best
journalistic
work
and
won
a
pulitzer
prize
for
his
reporting
on
the
six
day
war
in
the
middle
east
eventually
our
friendship
resume
and
for
that
great
credit
go
to
al
and
jean
who
might
well
have
harbor
a
grudge
forever
but
be
too
large
mind
for
that
later
al
write
me
that
he
have
only
two
regret
about
the
shift
one
be
that
i
hadn
t
the
wit
to
have
initiate
it
myself
and
the
second
be
that
i
be
awkward
in
fail
to
find
myself
afterwards
i
think
that
s
a
measure
of
extraordinary
character
in
a
man
who
have
essentially
be
fire
ironically
on
november
just
before
the
announcement
of
ben
s
take
over
al
have
sent
me

whither

washington

begin
by
good
luck
and
good
management
all
the
condition
be
present
to
make
the
post
the
best
paper
in
the
world
he
have
end
this
seven
page
memo
with
what
he
call
a
final
word
to
move
from
where
we
be
to
become
the
best
will
require
some
very
tough
decision
the
toughest
of
which
have
to
do
with
intention
and
goal
and
attitude
about
spending
must
of
course
be
make
by
you
they
will
not
be
easy
or
serene
or
reachable
overnight
he

work
at
once
to
build

of
which

give
a
goodbye
party
celebrate
the
year
they
have
together
serve
the
post
other
departure
later
on
worried
me
a
great
deal
i
be
deeply
distressed
over
lose
good
people
and
be
sure
they
have
left
because
of
something
i
d
do
or
neglect
to
do
not
realize
they
may
have
have
other
opportunity
too
good
to
decline
probably
ben
be
less
capable
as
a
manager
than
as
a
finder
of
talent
but
he
somehow
manage
by
osmosis
the
important
thing
be
that
he
excite
people
under
him
eventually
correct
whatever
mistake
he
make
and
move
on
he
rapidly
learn
the
rope
include
how
to
deal
with
john
sweeterman
about
budget
because
john
knew
more
than
ben
do
about
his
own
budget
ben
met
total
defeat
the
first
year
it
never
happen
again
when
he
go
in
the
next
year
and
dealt
with
john
on
more
even
term
and
with
my
unspoken
backing
thing
begin
to
change
john
respect
people
who
knew
what
they
be
talk
about
and
who
want
what
be
best
for
the
paper
ben
be
drive
to
make
the
paper
well
and
of
course
that
kind
of
push
be
expensive
ben
s
arrival
change
my
life
in
an
unexpected
way
he
be
the
first
person
place
in
a
major
position
by
me
and
the
difference
between
my
relationship
with
him
and
my
relationship
with
most
of
the
people
who
have
be
at
the
post
before
me
be
strike
despite
my
control
ownership
to
those
who
be
already
there
i
be
still
the
newcomer
the
junior
partner
even
though
they
be
mostly
friendly
and
generous
they
be
almost
always
the
leader
and
teacher
and
i
be
the
follower
ben
and
i
however
be
partner
very
much
together
in
focus
on
our
common
goal
though
some
may
have
view
him
as
a
bizarre
choice
it
be
the
right
one
for
me
idea
flew
out
of
ben
he
be
always
ask
important
why
question
why
not
build
start
or
buy
a
printing
plant
in
suburban
maryland
why
do
a
great
newspaper
have
to
lose
ground
he
sent
me
a
steady
stream
of
memo
on
thing
he
felt
the
post
ought
to
do
some
be
right
some
wrong
almost
all
be
interest
ben
be
tough
enough
and
good
enough
so
that
for
the
most
part
i
not
only
let
him
do
what
he
thought
be
right
i
largely
agree
with
him
when
i
didn
t
his
track
record
be
such
that
i
didn
t
like
go
head
to
head
with
him
as
time
go
on
i
learn
how
to
deal
with
him
as
he
do
with
me
there
be
certain
thing
we
d
talk
about
and
others
i
recognize
he
have
no
interest
in
and
i
figure
out
fairly
quickly
what
he
have
little
time
or
inclination
for
our
friendship
be
form
over
those
early
year
we
grow
fond
of
each
other
and
enjoy
a
wonderfully
complementary
and
constructive
professional
relationship
emotionally
uncomplicated
most
important
i
saw
constant
improvement
in
the
post
the
buildup
at
newsweek
be
as
dramatic
as
that
at
the
post
because
oz
elliott
have
a
fine
feel
for
cut
edge
issue
newsweek
distinguish
itself
in
the
s
become
a
hot
magazine
by
recognize
important
trend
write
about
racial
issue
and
the
new
sexual
more
and
reporting
on
them
before
our
competition
have
awaken
to
their
importance
from
a
business
point
of
view
the
magazine
be
do
less
well
fritz
be
extremely
lenient
with
the
editorial
and
business
manager
allow
them
to
operate
with
relative
freedom
and
without
have
to
adhere
to
strict
budget
i
have
no
idea
of
what
newsweek
could
earn
or
should
earn
and
those
in
charge
tend
to
resent
my
question
or
to
interpret
any
overture
as
interference
the
company
have
almost
no
corporate
staff
then
except
for
fritz
and
me
and
a
telephone
between
us
when
one
start
to
grow
newsweek
executive
mostly
disliked
the
idea
and
felt
threaten
as
long
as
oz
elliott
be
editor
and
gib
mccabe
be
publisher
or
president
the
magazine
go
from
strength
to
strength
both
in
editorial
quality
and
in
advertising
however
several
change
of
editor
include
oz
s
leave
and
then
return
create
upheaval
and
bad
feeling
chaos
ensue
for
a
while
with
many
talented
people
depart
in
press
account
and
outside
gossip
i
often
become
the
fall
guy
who
take
the
hit
for
whatever
mistake
we
be
view
as
make
whether
in
personnel
or
in
editorial
decision
i
be
also
the
recipient
of
grumble
whenever
newsweek
editor
be
unhappy
so
i
be
the
target
of
complaint
from
both
within
and
without
this
disarray
add
fuel
to
the
rumor
that
the
magazine
be
to
be
sell
rumor
that
inevitably
reach
print
and
understandably
shook
the
staff
i
suppose
they
arose
partly
because
financial
analyst
especially
after
we
go
public
saw
no
reason
why
this
relatively
less
profitable
part
of
our
business
should
be
retain
by
a
company
with
responsibility
to
shareholder
but
i
believe
then
and
still
believe
that
newsweek
matter
when
i
first
go
to
work
the
third
part
of
the
company
the
broadcast
division
consist
mainly
of
two
television
station
there
be
now
six
wtop
in
washington
d
c
a
popular
and
strong
franchise
and
wjxt
in
jacksonville
florida
which
be
begin
to
make
its
mark
through
its
investigative
reporting
john
hayes
have
admirably
lead
the
operation
of
the
station
but
in
lyndon
johnson
name
him
ambassador
to
switzerland
we
try
and
fail
to
find
a
successor
from
within
the
company
so
fritz
and
i
hire
larry
israel
who
have
be
the
head
of
westinghouse
broadcasting
station
group
and
he
brought
with
him
a
whole
new
group
of
people
the
most
important
of
whom
be
jim
snyder
who
become
news
director
of
wtop
radio
then
almost
immediately
of
wtop
tv
jim
be
truly
a
ben
bradlee
for
television
news
charismatic
drive
creative
devote
tough
and
skilled
at
develop
talented
people
larry
israel
do
certain
very
productive
thing
under
him
in
we
bought
a
television
station
in
miami
and
rename
it
in
phil
s
honor
with
the
call
letter
wplg
and
we
bought
a
station
in
hartford
in
larry
also
suggest
ban
cigarette
advertising
from
our
station
before
it
be
mandatory
and
thought
of
the
idea
of
donate
our
fm
radio
station
to
howard
university
although
we
didn
t
comprehend
the
value
of
fm
and
we
all
undervalue
the
gift
this
be
a
unique
action
at
the
time
there
be
no
broadcast
station
in
the
united
state
own
by
a
black
person
or
group
this
be
the
first
and
it
later
become
under
howard
university
s
management
the
number
one
rat
station
in
washington
larry
love
broadcasting
and
held
us
to
extremely
high
standard
in
program
and
news
the
station
be
much
improve
in
that
respect
but
he
have
little
idea
of
how
to
run
radio
not
much
sense
of
business
and
even
less
about
how
to
motivate
people
i
watch
him
at
several
meeting
shout
at
people
and
puzzle
over
this
but
decide
it
seem
to
be
work
i
be
wrong
as
president
of
the
washington
post
company
i
oversaw
all
three
of
these
division
and
in
do
so
rely
on
fritz
who
spent
most
of
his
time
in
new
york
and
ran
newsweek
and
on
different
people
within
each
division
unfortunately
fritz
and
i
have
one
fail
in
common
neither
of
us
be
a
manager
and
the
problem
of
management
seem
endless
and
intractable
i
be
always
interested
in
what
constitute
good
management
both
within
and
outside
our
industry
in
the
same
earnest
way
that
i
attack
many
thing
i
begin
to
do
my
homework
in
management
i
must
have
driven
everyone
around
me
crazy
by
study
everything
so
intensely
but
i
be
compel
to
know
more
i
travel
to
several
city
to
observe
newspaper
operation
i
spent
a
day
at
texas
instrument
which
have
an
excellent
reputation
at
that
time
for
its
planning
process
i
visit
the
headquarters
of
xerox
and
ncr
i
attend
a
week
long
hand
on
production
process
school
run
by
the
publisher
association
the
anpa
i
also
attend
ibm
s
seven
day
course
design
for
head
of
company
to
learn
more
about
computer
and
what
they
could
do
it
s
hard
to
realize
now
how
difficult
it
be
for
executive
only
thirty
year
ago
to
understand
this
new
technology
then
relatively
simple
how
it
could
help
them
and
how
to
introduce
it
into
a
company
for
big
city
newspaper
thing
be
even
more
difficult
because
of
the
stranglehold
the
typographical
union
have
on
us
but
i
knew
it
be
important
and
decide
to
take
the
course
which
be
held
in
an
old
country
house
in
endicott
new
york
we
be
a
class
of
ten
and
my
fellow
student
include
some
of
the
most
high
power
ablest
and
brightest
executive
in
the
country
all
male
of
course
there
be
men
who
ran
large
bank
in
boston
chicago
and
charlotte
and
two
head
of
insurance
company
as
well
as
the
head
of
bamberger
s
store
in
new
jersey
the
head
of
phillips
van
heusen
shirt
company
and
the
head
of
a
large
printing
company
my
unhappiness
at
find
myself
in
yet
another
situation
with
knowledgeable
men
far
more
experienced
than
i
quickly
reach
panic
proportion
but
my
worry
abate
somewhat
when
i
begin
to
grasp
that
they
be
nearly
as
apprehensive
as
i
be
and
be
feel
equally
sorry
for
themselves
at
be
strand
there
for
a
solid
week
we
rapidly
bond
together
like
people
achieve
instant
familiarity
on
an
ocean
liner
my
favorite
memory
of
the
week
be
of
an
even
when
we
student
gather
in
one
of
the
tiny
room
that
serve
as
bedroom
alcohol
be
prohibit
on
the
program
but
several
of
the
men
more
dare
than
i
have
packed
bottle
in
their
suitcase
all
ten
of
us
stood
around
the
bed
sneak
a
drink
before
dinner
it
be
wonderfully
ludicrous
to
see
these
pillar
of
the
establishment
stand
awkwardly
around
drinking
clandestinely
out
of
paper
cup
by
the
end
of
the
week
i
realize
that
i
have
retain
enough
of
what
i
have
learn
at
least
to
joke
about
it
there
be
nothing
to
joke
about
however
in
my
relationship
with
john
sweeterman
some
of
the
difficulty
arose
because
i
be
more
interested
in
the
editorial
side
of
the
operation
than
in
the
business
side
others
however
have
their
source
directly
in
the
way
john
and
i
dealt
with
each
other
i
resent
his
inability
to
accept
me
on
the
other
hand
i
never
understood
how
much
his
position
on
the
paper
have
change
with
my
arrival
on
the
scene
and
i
didn
t
seem
able
to
get
over
my
fear
of
him
i
defer
to
him
more
often
than
not
backing
down
quickly
whenever
there
be
the
slightest
hint
that
there
might
be
a
confrontation
i
still
recall
vividly
the
trouble
we
have
over
an
admittedly
minor
matter
the
post
s
chief
telephone
operator
molly
parker
be
retire
after
fifty
year
at
the
switchboard
she
have
know
all
my
family
and
be
close
to
my
child
who
when
they
be
small
often
picked
up
our
direct
line
to
the
paper
to
talk
to
her
she
always
take
time
for
them
i
give
molly
a
farewell
dinner
at
my
house
and
bought
her
a
small
diamond
pin
when
i
told
john
about
this
he
become
quite
angry
and
ask
if
i
didn
t
see
that
this
set
a
precedent
from
my
point
of
view
molly
parker
s
fifty
year
didn
t
present
much
of
a
precedent
problem
i
be
ashamed
to
admit
that
even
after
several
year
in
the
work
world
i
be
reduce
to
tear
by
john
s
anger
an
unacceptable
response
and
one
i
eventually
outgrew
but
not
for
many
year
in
some
way
john
be
a
victim
of
my
lifelong
tendency
to
fasten
on
what
be
wrong
or
could
be
well
rather
than
on
what
be
right
i
turn
this
characteristic
on
myself
as
well
be
overly
self
critical
much
of
the
time
but
i
realize
that
others
only
become
aware
of
it
when
they
and
their
work
be
the
target
i
be
see
as
always
find
fault
or
second
guess
i
m
sure
it
make
me
difficult
to
get
along
with
particularly
for
someone
like
john
whom
i
later
come
to
appreciate
and
for
whom
i
have
great
affection
i
once
ask
him
what
he
thought
be
the
most
important
quality
a
person
run
the
paper
should
have
good
judgment
he
reply
don
t
worry
about
your
experience
i
be
see
as
seek
help
or
advice
from
too
many
people
on
the
outside
instead
of
rely
on
my
own
people
that
be
a
justified
complaint
but
i
simply
have
no
idea
how
differently
human
behave
in
professional
situation
and
it
take
me
too
long
to
learn
and
pick
other
people
s
brain
be
my
way
of
learn
for
john
the
contrast
between
work
under
phil
and
work
with
me
be
just
too
great
while
i
toil
away
at
learn
about
management
i
be
also
busy
in
other
area
we
make
a
few
acquisition
in
these
year
which
help
me
feel
we

forward
on
the
business
side
of
the
company
the
first
one
in

to
be
a
fine
one
if
not
a
great
profit
center
over
the
year
in
a
complicate
and
sometimes
irritate

of

and
when
i
stayed
with

would
talk
about

for
hour

pay
no
attention
to
me
he
explain
that

thing
get

a
bottle
from
have
never
live
this
kind
of
life
i
d
never

quarter
of

be
barely
a
couple
of
spoon
for
each
of
us
in
addition
the
chicken

of
the
most
stun
moment

say
with

be
always
behind

never
appear
in
public
with
truman
but
have
be
persuade
to
come
to
the
ball
curiously
once
people
manage
to
get
through
the
press
gauntlet
outside
they
seem
to
forget
the
camera
and
the
self
consciousness
and
the
ball
become
a
genuinely
intimate
easy
even
cozy
party
peter
duchin
s
magic
music
and
the
very
good
simple
food
help
enormously
there
be
memorable

of
a
little
top
and
carry
a
black
and
white
mask
susan
mary
recall
her
look
absolutely
gorgeous
and
with
a
beautiful
figure
her
governess
follow
her
into
the
library
in
tear
not
know
what
to
do
penelope
be
allow
to
go
to
the
ball
and
diana
vreeland
ever
the
sharp
observant
editor
hire
her
that
night
and
she
become
one
of
the
high
paid
model
in
new
york
why
be
i
the
guest
of
honor
who
know
truman
and
i
be
good
friend
but
we
be
on
a
less
intimate
basis
than
he
be
with
babe
or
marella
probably
the
two
most
famous
beauty
in
the
world
in
discuss
who
be
more
beautiful
truman
once
say
if
they
be
both
in
tiffany
s
window
marella
would
be
more
expensive
he
be
also
great
friend
with
slim
keith
and
pamela
hayward
and
lee
radziwill
in
the
end
however
when
he
have
fall
out
with
so
many
of
his
friend
he
never
turn
on
me
as
he
do
on
most
of
them
i
think
he
felt
protective
of
me
truman
knew
i
didn
t
lead
the
glamorous
kind
of
life
that
many
of
his
friend
do
he
may
have
give
the
party
for
me
primarily
so
that
i
could
see
it
all
up
close
just
once
i
also
think
i
be
appropriate
for
the
occasion
because
i
really
be
a
sort
of
middle
age
debutante
even
a
cinderella
as
far
as
that
kind
of
life
be
concerned
i
didn
t
know
most
of
these
people
or
their
world
and
they
didn
t
know
me
he
felt
he
need
a
reason
for
the
party
a
guest
of
honor
and
i
be
from
a
different
world
and
not
in
competition
with
his
more
glamorous
friend
one
of
truman
s
biographer
gerald
clarke
conjecture
she
be
arguably
the
most
powerful
woman
in
the
country
but
still
largely
unknown
outside
washington
put
her
in
the
spotlight
be
also
his
ultimate
act
as
pygmalion
it
would
symbolize
her
emergence
from
her
dead
husband
s
shadow
she
would
become
her
own
woman
before
the
entire
world
the
coverage
of
the
party
here
at
home
and
internationally
go
on
for
week
after
the
event
give
truman
enormous
pleasure
mr
longworth
say
that
the
party
be
the
most
exquisite
of
spectator
sport
which
the
new
york
time
use
as
the
headline
for
its
extensive
story
on
the
event
the
post
in
an
ambiguous
position
ran
the
story
on
the
front
page
of
the
woman
s
section
the
day
after
the
ball
i
get
a
call
from
diana
vreeland
ask
me
to
have
everything
put
back
on
the
hair
the
face
the
dress
and
to
pose
for
photograph
by
cecil
beaton
again
he
have
do
some
photo
of
me
before
the
ball
since
she
thought
i
look
so
much
well
fix
up
by
kenneth
arthur
schlesinger
write
a
flatter
piece
to
go
with
those
photo
and
it
ran
in
vogue
the
follow
january
my
own
reaction
to
all
this
attention
be
mixed
the
publicity
and
high
profile
frighten
me
a
little
and
might
actually
have
hurt
me
and
probably
should
have
give
the
serious
professional
person
i
be
try
to
be
oddly
however
the
party
itself
for
the
most
part
escape
be
described
as
marie
antoinette
s
last
fling
perhaps
this
be
because
the
woman
s
movement
have
not
yet
come
to
the
fore
and
it
be
before
the
most
serious
racial
urban
problem
surface
and
before
vietnam
become
the
burning
issue
that
so
dominate
our
society
this
be
the
last
possible
moment
such
a
party
could
take
place
and
not
be
widely
excoriate
to
a
certain
extent
of
course
it
be
pete
hamill
review
it
in
the
new
york
post
and
juxtapose
wisp
of
conversation
from
the
party
with
horror
story
from
vietnam
my
quaker
friend
drew
pearson
who
have
come
to
the
ball
as
my
guest
because
i
love
his
wife
luvie
write
a
highly
critical
column
this
after
promising
luvie
that
if
he
come
he
wouldn
t
comment
negatively
say
that
truman
s
party
overshadow
the
tragedy
in
kansa
which
won
him
fame
and
that
marella
agnelli
should
have
donate
the
price
of
her
dress
to
flood
relief
in
italy
for
me
the
party
be
just
great
pleasure
maybe
doubly
so
because
it
be
unlike
my
real
life
i
be
flatter
and
although
it
may
not
have
be
my
style
for
one
magic
night
i
be
transform
in
don
graham
graduate
from
harvard
magna
cum
laude
despite
have
spent
most
of
his
time
edit
the
crimson
he
have
decide
to
volunteer
for
the
army
and
not
wait
to
be
draft
a
decision
that
surprised
me
i
have
suppose
he
would
go
on
to
graduate
school
which
you
be
still
allow
to
do
and
stay
draft
exempt
most
of
don
s
friend
be
against
the
war
and
don
himself
have
reservation
but
when
i
ask
him
about
his
decision
he
quietly
reply
the
rich
be
stay
in
school
and
the
poor
be
be
draft
i
can
t
live
with
that
the
possibility
or
probability
of
his
go
to
vietnam
concerned
me
but
there
be
no
way
to
argue
with
that
kind
of
think
on
august
i
drove
don
to
washington
s
union
station
early
in
the
morning
we
say
goodbye
and
he
get
on
the
train
head
for
fort
bragg
north
carolina
it
be
an
awful
scene
so
reminiscent
of
phil
s
departure
for
the
army
twenty
four
year
earlier
don
s
reaction
to
the
military
be
like
phil
s
too
depressed
by
the
nearly
complete
lack
of
logic
in
army
routine
the
mindless
brutality
he
saw
everywhere
and
the
rule
design
to
promote
fear
while
still
in
college
don
have
fall
in
love
with
a
fellow
crimson
editor
mary
wissler
and
they
decide
to
get
married
i
question
this
decision
mildly
on
ground
of
youth
they
be
both
twenty
one
and
the
confuse
emotion
brought
on
by
the
army
but
he
be
adamant
our
whole
family
and
don
s
and
mary
s
friend
assemble
for
the
wedding
in
january
in
chicago
where
mary
have
grown
up
only
six
month
later
don
be
on
his
way
to
vietnam
the
war
be
just
begin
to
be
the
sear
anguish
issue
it
later
become
and
now
it
invade
my
personal
life
don
s
letter
throughout
the
year
he
spent
in
vietnam
assign
to
the
first
air
cavalry
give
me
my
truest
and
best
view
of
what
be
go
on
there
one
of
his
first
write
just
two
week
after
his
arrival
in
the
country
reflect
skepticism
already
though
i
cringe
at
the
thought
of
what
infantryman
do
to
the
people
over
here
i
admire
them
enormously
for
stick
it
out
for
fight
a
war
they
hate
in
a
country
they
loathe
for
a
cause
they
neither
care
about
nor
believe
in
he
write
to
mary
that
whatever
the
outcome
of
the
war
the
bad
will
not
be
for
us
but
for
these
poor
poor
vietnamese
who
will
go
on
suffer
no
matter
what
happens
in
september
he
write
me
the
only
thing
i
can
vaguely
see
from
over
here
be
that
many
policy
which
seem
bad
be
be
pursue
because
it
be
impossible
for
the
administration
to
change
them
without
admit
serious
previous
error
suppose
mcnamara
now
conclude
that
the
bombing
all
along
have
be
do
no
good
that
it
have
produce
no
substantial
result
and
have
to
be
stop
could
johnson
turn
around
and
say
well
we
have
lose
a
few
plane
and
a
few
hundred
pilot
and
a
few
million
dollar
but
we
have
decide
that
we
be
in
error
in
january
he
write
i
bet
this
all
sound
familiar
probably
daddy
write
home
about
the
same
thing
i
expect
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
here
anyone
who
saw
world
war
ii
would
find
familiar
one
thing
must
be
miss
though
i
ve
never
heard
anyone
express
much
concern
about
how
the
war
end
or
whether
it
end
or
indeed
any
expectation
that
it
will
end
before
the
expiration
of
anyone
s
tour
the
one
year
hitch
he
add
which
be
responsible
for
our
high
morale
and
much
more
be
also
responsible
for
this
for
a
while
the
post
have
only
one
reporter
in
vietnam
ward
just
who
as
early
as
mid
october
of
have
a
piece
in
outlook
about
how
hard
it
be
to
believe
anything
about
vietnam
don
read
it
and
agree
write
me
there
really
be
too
damn
much
self
deception
go
on
among
the
us
military
in
this
country
from
what
he
could
see
civilian
casualty
in
vietnam
be
horrify
and
he
add
it
just
seem
goddamned
awful
that
we
be
do
such
immense
damage
to
people
who
be
truly
innocent
bystander
who
never
want
us
to
fight
for
them
or
the
north
vietnamese
and
even
if
the
outcome
of
the
war
be
somehow
positive
i
think
our
treatment
of
these
people
will
ensure
that
no
government
consider
too
friendly
to
the
us
will
endure
in
south
vietnam
meanwhile
as
television
brought
the
war
right
into
our
living
room
the
home
front
be
begin
to
boil
many
young
people
felt
it
be
just
as
patriotic
to
protest
the
war
as
it
be
to
serve
the
country
by
fight
in
it
don
hearing
about
the
demonstration
across
the
country
worried
about
their
effect
i
recognize
people
i
knew
as
conservative
or
politically
uninterested
go
through
what
i
do
recognition
of
the
radical
home
truth
war
be
bad
we
be
act
cruelly
and
terribly
toward
the
vietnamese
and
the
thrill
that
come
from
participate
in
something
like
the
protest
at
the
same
time
over
here
i
talk
to
people
who
have
have
another
totally
change
experience
they
have
see
friend
die
and
they
know
they
be
go
to
die
and
they
don
t
want
to
die
now
they
could
care
less
about
what
we
do
to
the
vietnamese
we
will
come
out
of
the
war
so
fragment
i
wonder
what
will
happen
i
be
see
and
experience
some
of
that
fragmentation
in
my
own
family
my
second
son
bill
chose
the
opposite
route
of
demonstrate
and
protest
against
the
war
both
bill
and
steve
be
of
the
generation
that
transform
this
country
they
let
their
hair
grow
experiment
with
drug
and
lead
a
new
and
different
kind
of
life
that
fall
of
bill
be
arrest
for
demonstrate
in
front
of
the
oakland
induction
center
during
stop
the
draft
week
he
appear
in
a
photograph
with
a
raise
hand
confront
a
policeman
which
the
police
maintain
be
a
threat
but
which
bill
say
be
an
act
of
self
defense
since
he
clearly
wasn
t
about
to
try
to
hit
an
arm
officer
the
judge
threaten
to
send
all
the
protester
to
jail
our
company
lawyer
bill
rogers
undertook
to
defend
bill
work
through
one
of
his
law
partner
in
san
francisco
i
didn
t
want
bill
to
have
a
jail
record
and
in
the
end
bill
rogers
save
him
from
jail
but
he
get
arrest
again
during
his
senior
year
for
a
sit
in
at
stanford
s
scientific
research
institute
which
do
some
defense
work
that
time
the
protester
hire
a
lawyer
to
represent
them
as
a
group
and
i
wasn
t
allow
to
interfere
for
me
it
be
strange
and
strain
to
have
one
son
in
the
war
in
vietnam
and
one
at
home
demonstrate
against
it
to
a
certain
extent
this
be
a
product
of
their
personality
but
even
more
it
be
the
three
year
age
difference
between
them
this
difference
of
opinion
didn
t
affect
their
relationship
with
each
other
or
mine
with
either
of
them
but
their
two
reaction
certainly
add
to
my
own
doubt
about
the
war
and
eventually
to
my
feeling
about
how
the
post
should
position
itself
rus
wiggins
as
editor
of
the
post
be
oversee
the
whole
editorial
and
news
operation
focus
on
the
editorial
page
for
the
most
part
particularly
after
ben
come
to
manage
the
news
side
even
though
i
be
still
basically
follow
rus
s
support
of
the
administration
i
be
begin
to
be
concerned
about
our
position
on
the
war
and
have
a
lot
of
question
great
heat
have
be
focus
on
me
mostly
by
my
friend
bill
fulbright
and
walter
lippmann
and
to
some
extent
by
bobby
kennedy
whom
i
knew
less
well
but
saw
occasionally
fulbright
have
accuse
the
post
of
obsequiously
follow
administration
policy
and
he
invite
me
to
lunch
with
him
on
capitol
hill
to
try
to
get
me
to
turn
our
editorial
policy
around
i
listen
but
i
m
not
sure
with
how
much
of
an
open
mind
i
be
pretty
convince
still
that
rus
be
right
about
the
war
i
be
also
get
complaint
from
reader
in
march
before
i
have
begin
to
be
more
question
i
write
one
post
reader
say
defensively
we
do
in
general
agree
with
the
white
house
position
on
vietnam
while
there
be
obviously
a
great
deal
of
room
for
difference
of
opinion
on
this
subject
we
be
in
no
way
in
touch
with
the
white
house
nor
do
we
talk
to
anybody
in
it
about
our
editorial
i
write
another
woman
in
june
we
approach
our
position
on
vietnam
with
the
same
degree
of
concern
and
worry
that
everyone
share
on
this
difficult
and
frustrate
war
i
be
sure
rus
wiggins
the
editor
keep
review
our
policy
on
the
bombing
with
an
open
mind
however
as
long
as
we
have
half
a
million
troop
in
the
south
i
suppose
they
need
any
support
we
can
give
them
even
so
i
be
become
increasingly
uneasy
about
the
paper
s
position
i
also
saw
that
the
news
side
and
the
editorial
page
be
diverge
more
and
more
about
the
war
a
editorial
state
clearly
we
be
in
south
vietnam
to
preserve
the
right
of
a
small
people
to
govern
themselves
and
make
their
own
choice
ward
just
a
month
later
write
in
a
dispatch
we
be
here
defend
freedom
as
we
understand
it
for
people
who
don
t
think
about
the
war
in
vietnam
consume
much
of
our
time
and
energy
at
the
paper
during
the
late
s
and
early
s
nowhere
more
so
than
in
editorial
page
conference
rus
himself
write
most
of
the
vietnam
editorial
at
least
through
the
end
of
ben
and
i
both
knew
that
rus
have
every
intention
of
retire
at
the
age
of
sixty
five
which
he
would
reach
at
the
end
of
so
we
be
look
for
someone
to
lead
the
page
after
that
somehow
phil
geyelin
a
respect
diplomatic
reporter
for
the
wall
street
journal
have
get
a
message
to
ben
that
he
be
interested
in
the
job
in
phil
graham
have
try
to
get
geyelin
to
the
post
but
he
have
decide
to
stay
with
the
journal
in
the
meantime
he
d
grown
restless
there
and
now
that
his
friend
ben
have
come
to
the
post
he
be
much
more
positive
about
it
when
ben
propose
the
idea
of
geyelin
i
welcome
it
in
august
of
phil
and
his
wife
sherry
come
to
visit
me
on
martha
s
vineyard
where
i
be
vacation
he
and
i
take
long
walk
discuss
everything
about
the
paper
particularly
the
role
of
an
editorial
page
in
the
nation
s
capital
his
lack
of
knowledge
of
local
issue
and
what
our
relationship
might
be
i
also
suggest
to
phil
that
he
talk
to
walter
lippmann
who
phil
later
told
me
give
him
simple
but
great
advice
for
an
editorial
page
beware
of
predictability
we
spoke
at
some
length
about
what
i
call
the
no
surprise
rule
i
told
him
something
that
i
have
say
to
every
editor
i
ve
ever
work
with
that
i
didn
t
want
to
read
anything
in
the
paper
of
great
importance
or
that
represent
an
abrupt
change
which
we
hadn
t
discuss
that
i
want
to
be
in
on
the
takeoff
as
well
as
the
landing
as
editor
he
would
have
real
autonomy
i
didn
t
expect
to
agree
with
every
specific
but
i
expect
to
have
a
constant
conversation
in
which
we
would
each
know
what
the
other
be
think
i
warn
him
that
i
didn
t
want
to
wake
up
more
often
than
not
to
editorial
with
which
i
didn
t
agree
i
recall
tell
him
that
if
that
turn
out
to
be
the
case
something
would
have
to
give
to
which
he
jokingly
say
he
assume
that
wouldn
t
be
the
owner
most
of
all
we
talk
about
vietnam
phil
have
make
two
trip
to
vietnam
for
the
journal
as
a
result
of
which
he
have
grown
oppose
to
the
war
conclude
that
it
be
unwinnable
but
to
my
great
relief
he
be
moderate
in
his
view
and
i
felt
comfortable
with
his
think
we
agree
that
the
post
ought
to
work
its
way
out
of
the
very
supportive
editorial
position
it
have
take
but
that
we
couldn
t
be
precipitous
we
have
to
move
away
gradually
from
where
we
have
be
he
use
the
image
that
change
our
policy
be
like
turn
a
great
vessel
around
you
first
have
to
slow
down
before
you
could
start
to
turn
when
phil
come
aboard
in
january
as
an
editorial
writer
but
clearly
slat
to
succeed
rus
the
tension
within
the
editorial
page
staff
increase
and
the
argument
about
vietnam
at
editorial
meeting
grow
more
vociferous
by
this
time
almost
everyone
on
the
page
except
rus
have
begin
to
change
his
view
on
vietnam
herblock
who
in
and
have
kept
his
pen
relatively
benign
on
the
war
begin
to
draw
cartoon
that
be
much
more
critical
of
the
administration
s
policy
and
decision
ward
just
s
reporting
from
vietnam
which
i
view
as
perceptive
detach
and
accurate
become
tougher
as
he
grow
more
disenchant
with
the
war
rus
however
remain
uncharacteristically
lock
into
his
position
fortunately
he
be
always
good
temper
and
forgive
and
never
personal
in
his
passion
which
make
discussion
possible
despite
the
violent
emotion
vietnam
arouse
the
back
and
forth
between
rus
and
phil
result
in
a
sort
of
two
step
forward
one
step
back
movement
but
in
the
end
the
post
do
begin
to
turn
around
its
editorial
position
on
the
war
an
amuse
sidelight
be
that
when
phil
brought
meg
greenfield
to
the
post
as
an
editorial
writer
in
july
rus
in
the
throe
of
our
debate
over
vietnam
say
to
phil
my
boy
you
re
make
the
mistake
of
your
life
she
s
on
my
side
there
be
side
on
vietnam
what
president
johnson
seem
to
feel
as
time
go
on
be
that
he
be
on
one
side
and
i
and
the
post
except
for
his
friend
rus
of
whom
he
once
say
that
one
of
his
editorial
be
worth
as
much
to
him
as
a
division
in
vietnam
appear
to
be
on
the
other
the
war
definitely
get
in
the
way
of
my
friendly
relationship
with
lyndon
johnson
but
even
before
the
war
heat
up
i
seem
to
have
be
on
his
bad
side
he
have
stop
call
me
himself
and
by
our
relation
be
definitely
somewhat
distant
i
be
no
longer
ask
to
anything
intimate
or
friendly
and
though
i
be
invite
to
state
occasion
from
time
to
time
his
greet
in
the
receive
line
be
frigid
or
almost
nonexistent
because
i
saw
lady
bird
regularly
in
connection
with
the
beautification
committee
and
because
i
be
so
busy
to
begin
with
i
wasn
t
fully
aware
of
how
the
president
be
distance
himself
from
me
the
distance
however
be
real
i
be
visit
confidentially
first
by
bill
moyers
and
later
by
bob
kintner
who
serve
a
brief
stint
in
the
white
house
both
bill
and
bob
want
to
be
helpful
carry
the
same
strange
story
that
the
president
have
heard
i
have
call
in
my
editor
and
told
them
that
he
be
try
to
influence
me
by
invite
me
to
the
white
house
and
that
they
be
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
this
the
very
idea
that
i
would
do
such
a
thing
be
inconceivable
to
me
i
be
incredulous
but
so
impressed
at
have
heard
the
same
story
twice
that
i
decide
to
write
the
president
to
straighten
thing
out
on
may
i
write
him
what
i
genuinely
felt
i
hear
from
two
of
our
mutual
good
friend
that
the
washington
grapevine
carry
back
to
you
something
i
be
suppose
to
have
say
i
be
both
sad
and
baffle
at
how
such
an
erroneous
report
could
have
be
invent
it
s
terribly
presumptuous
of
me
to
take
up
your
time
to
assure
you
i
would
never
think
anything
like
what
be
attribute
to
me
much
less
say
it
because
if
i
have
it
would
have
be
pompous
stupid
and
rude
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
only
think
the
thing
i
say
directly
to
you
at
the
ranch
about
be
for
what
you
be
try
to
do
for
this
country
and
believe
very
much
in
your
ability
and
courage
to
do
them
because
i
be
responsible
for
two
publication
one
or
the
other
of
them
be
probably
bound
in
the
nature
of
thing
to
irritate
you
or
bad
at
time
and
i
be
always
sorry
when
we
add
to
your
problem
whatever
reason
i
only
hope
that
at
other
time
our
support
have
be
of
some
small
pleasure
or
help
there
be
so
many
worry
on
your
shoulder
that
i
hesitate
to
bother
you
about
this
nonsense
i
just
decide
there
be
too
much
in
our
past
to
leave
such
a
horrid
misapprehension
lie
around
phil
would
not
have
like
it
devotedly
this
letter
sound
toady
it
wasn
t
meant
to
be
i
greatly
admire
president
johnson
even
though
i
eventually
differ
with
him
on
vietnam
i
have
no
problem
if
he
be
angry
about
our
editorial
policy
on
vietnam
or
even
about
our
more
objective
news
policy
as
oppose
to
phil
s
what
i
mind
then
and
i
mind
now
be
when
misunderstanding
get
in
the
way
of
proper
professional
relation
the
very
real
problem
between
the
post
and
any
president
be
complicate
enough
without
fictitious
and
malicious
story
make
unneeded
trouble
johnson
have
be
a
friend
but
i
also
knew
he
be
paranoid
enough
to
let
something
like
this
weird
story
anger
him
when
lbj
respond
the
next
week
it
be
with
what
i
consider
a
slap
in
the
face
i
be
of
course
happy
to
hear
from
you
in
your
letter
the
spirit
in
which
it
be
write
be
most
welcome
mr
johnson
and
i
be
fond
of
you
as
we
be
of
phil
he
be
still
very
sorely
miss
by
those
of
us
who
knew
him
so
well
there
be
so
much
say
and
write
that
be
untrue
that
to
try
to
deal
with
it
would
be
an
endless
task
contrary
to
what
some
of
your
columnist
colleague
seem
to
feel
i
let
most
of
it
pas
but
i
do
feel
obligate
to
try
to
correct
certain
untruth
that
take
on
large
proportion
than
others
i
owe
that
to
the
office
not
to
mention
my
family
a
great
deal
of
gossip
and
opinion
wind
up
in
print
often
under
the
guise
of
fact
a
great
deal
more
make
the
cocktail
circuit
it
be
always
good
to
expose
it
as
such
when
possible
and
that
should
be
the
duty
and
privilege
of
both
of
us
clearly
johnson
found
life
with
the
post
phil
graham
newspaper
difficult
certainly
the
president
be
grow
more
and
more
discomfit
with
our
reporting
especially
about
vietnam
to
johnson
loyalty
be
everything
loyalty
as
he
define
it
the
paper
in
texas
and
their
publisher
be
loyal
phil
graham
have
be
loyal
why
be
i
allow
my
paper
to
report
and
say
such
thing
about
his
policy
from
his
point
of
view
accord
to
those
around
him
johnson
saw
me
at
time
as
mastermind
the
paper
against
his
interest
and
at
other
time
as
be
too
permissive
and
he
use
his
aide
especially
jack
valenti
and
joe
califano
to
approach
or
reproach
me
after
one
call
jack
go
back
to
him
and
say
well
mr
president
kay
say
that
she
doesn
t
write
these
story
and
doesn
t
command
the
story
to
be
write
to
which
johnson
reply
well
by
god
if
i
own
a
goddamn
newspaper
i
ought
to
have
some
people
around
me
who
be
go
to
do
what
i
want
hell
i
d
just
as
soon
have
a
pack
of
beagle
dog
out
there
at
least
i
can
train
them
when
jack
remind
him
that
he
didn
t
tell
his
newspeople
at
the
austin
station
he
own
what
to
report
the
president
reply
i
m
not
down
in
austin
by
god
kay
graham

in
her
office
she
ought
to
know
what
the
hell
those
goddamn
reporter
be
write
this
be
such
a
classic
politician
s
attitude
about
a
publisher
every
politician
probably
believe
publisher
sit
in
their
office
doling
out
order
to
reporter
about
what
to
write
when
lbj
particularly
hat
reading
story
in
the
post
that
predict
what
he
be
go
to
do
one
of
the
early
one
on
which
he
and
i
cross
sword
be
when
we
have
heard
that
he
be
go
to
appoint
walter
washington
as
the
mayor
of
washington
d
c
the
president
call
me
himself
to
say
i
have
to
understand
that
if
we
ran
the
story
walter
wasn
t
go
to
be
appoint
califano
call
ben
several
time
during
the
day
plead
with
him
not
to
run
the
story
and
thereby
ruin
washington
s
chance
it
be
the
good
side
of
ben
and
the
obdurate
side
as
well
that
there
be
no
way
he
be
not
go
to
run
the
story
i
didn
t
try
to
stop
him
when
we
do
print
it
the
president
indeed
held
up
the
nomination
for
a
few
week
and
then
announce
the
appointment
as
he
have
plan
accord
to
jack
valenti
those
leak
be
kind
of
like
somebody
drop
carbolic
acid
on
him
he
consider
them
a
personal
affront
what
the
president
never
accepted
or
even
clearly
understood
as
most
people
don
t
understand
be
the
autonomy
editor
have
and
must
have
to
produce
a
good
newspaper
i
use
to
describe
it
as
liberty
not
license
i
felt
then
as
now
that
i
be
never
antagonistic
to
lyndon
johnson
i
be
do
my
job
at
the
paper
as
i
define
it
and
he
be
do
his
on
a
couple
of
occasion
president
johnson
do
send
for
me
on
matter
of
business
one
of
the
first
be
about
his
want
to
send
john
hayes
to
switzerland
as
ambassador
hayes
have
help
lbj
with
broadcasting
problem
during
the
campaign
and
this
be
his
reward
carroll
kilpatrick
go
in
with
rus
and
me
for
what
turn
out
to
be
a
fairly
leisurely
and
informal
conversation
mostly
on
vietnam
among
other
thing
the
president
talk
about
the
recent
bombing
pause
say
he
felt
it
be
a
mistake
because
ho
chi
minh
could
view
it
as
a
sign
of
weakness
and
vacillation
he
look
directly
at
me
and
ask
how
my
son
would
feel
if
we
be
walk
down
a
street
and
someone
slap
me
on
one
side
of
the
face
and
then
step
back
and
slap
me
on
the
other
and
my
son
s
hand
be
tie
behind
his
back
well
the

sat
down

office
he

at
a
very
rapid
pace
and
obviously
on
the
record
these
be
the
day
before
tape
recorder
be
routine
a
quick
glance
at
bill
pepper
make
me
realize
that
i
d
well
start
take
note
which
i
do
for
a
solid
two
hour
while
tito
talk
over
a
range
of
subject
once
we
finish
we
return
to
belgrade
where
i
slog
away
summarize
the
interview
as
best
i
could
and
sent
the
story
off
to
the
post
where
they
ran
it
on
the
front
page
with
my
byline
unlike
the
case
at
many
newspaper
the
post
s
editor
really
be
free
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
use
the
publisher
s
contribution
and
they
often
downplayed
story
i
sent
back
from
these
trip
have
be
away
from
home
for
several
week
i
return
to
find
that
problem
have
pile
up
while
i
be
go
i
set
to
work
and
also
spent
a
week
of
many
night
out
after
which
i
go
to
glen
welby
with
billy
steve
lally
and
yann
for
what
i
hop
would
be
a
restful
family
weekend
it
turn
out
to
unleash
yet
another
crisis
we
be
in
the
middle
of
a
tennis
game
and
i
be
about
to
serve
when
i
look
up
into
the
sun
and
pass
out
cold
with
a
convulsion
it
be
actually
much
more
frighten
for
those
who
witness
it
than
it
be
for
me
who
didn
t
really
understand
what
have
happen
i
come
to
with
billy
and
yann
reassure
me
and
say
that
i
have
be
unconscious
that
they
have
sent
for
an
ambulance
and
that
i
would
be
take
to
the
george
washington
university
hospital
for
test
the
doctor
test
for
everything
include
a
brain
tumor
which
be
the
most
terrify
prospect
but
after
six
day
in
the
hospital
i
be
told
simply
that
i
have
some
sort
of
irregularity
in
my
brain
that
could
have
come
from
anything
include
an
injury
at
birth
or
scar
from
the
earlier
tb
my
doctor
put
me
on
an
antiseizure
drug
dilantin
a
strong
drug
which
no
one
explain
to
me
it
take
me
almost
a
year
to
get
even
somewhat
use
to
it
and
my
body
never
quite
accommodate
to
it
i
would
often
have
spell
when
i
would
suddenly
feel
faint
or
get
palpitation
and
be
worried
that
i
d
never
be
able
to
travel
again
or
even
feel
completely
comfortable
about
engage
in
sport
or
other
rigorous
activity
later
hop
to
get
off
the
drug
since
i
have
have
no
more
seizure
i
kept
check
with
the
neurologist
who
would
do
brain
scan
and
tell
me
the
problem
still
exist
and
that
i
have
to
keep
take
the
pill
finally
after
about
fifteen
year
i
found
a
brilliant
neurologist
who
say
i
can
t
promise
you
ll
never
have
another
one
if
you
stop
take
it
but
i
d
rather
see
you
have
another
one
than
stay
on
that
drug
so
i
stop
felt
much
well
right
away
and
have
never
have
another
attack
some
week
after
the
initial
incident
i
start
to
go
out
again
one
of
my
first
outing
be
to
a
small
informal
party
at
liz
and
george
stevens
s
home
at
which
after
dinner
bobby
kennedy
start
argue
with
me
about
the
post
s
position
on
vietnam
keep
up
a
steady
drumbeat
about
how
hopeless
the
war
be
and
why
didn
t
i
do
something
about
it
he
be
perfectly
pleasant
but
my
head
start
pound
and
i
felt
that
i
might
faint
i
knew
i
have
to
leave
so
i
quickly
say
to
bobby
i
m
terribly
sorry
this
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
conversation
but
i
have
to
go
and
get
out
in
a
hurry
i
so
much
didn
t
want
him
to
think
that
i
be
avoid
conversation
about
the
war
that
i
write
him
a
note
say
i
hadn
t
want
to
end
the
conversation
but
have
be
afraid
i
be
go
to
have
some
physical
problem
if
i
didn
t
leave
i
get
a
charm
letter
back
say
i
hope
you
be
feel
well
i
often
have
that
effect
on
people
but
they
recover
rapidly
the
year
be
a
crucial
one
for
the
country
and
for
me
personally
our
involvement
in
the
war
be
tear
at
the
society
more
fiercely
than
ever
on
march
bobby
kennedy
announce
that
he
would
be
a
candidate
for
the
democratic
nomination
for
the
presidency
lbj
told
carroll
kilpatrick
in
an
off
the
record
interview
that
kennedy
s
announcement
neither
surprised
nor
upset
him
in
fact
he
say
that
he
have
always
believe
kennedy
would
run
because
the
senator
found
something
to
criticize
or
object
to
in
every
one
of
his
legislative
proposal
johnson
still
felt
he
be
right
about
vietnam
and
cite
the
fact
that
every
asian
leader
be
tell
him
to
hold
on
only
two
week
after

spoke
to
kilpatrick
however
the
president
stun
the
world
by
announce
at
the
end
of
some
televise
remark
about
vietnam
that
he
would
not
run
for
reelection
say
i
have
conclude
that
i
should
not
permit
the
presidency
to
become
involve
in
the
partisan
division
that
be
develop
in
this
political
year
lyndon
johnson
his
famous
energy
flag
take
himself
out
of
the
race
in
many
way
lyndon
have
be
consume
by
the
war
in
vietnam
he
remain
bitter
about
what
people
thought
of
him
and
the
extent
to
which
the
war
obscure
many
of
his
domestic
accomplishment
just
over
a
month
after
he
withdrew
from
the
race
carroll
kilpatrick
spent
several
hour
with
him
on
a
flight
from
independence
missouri
where
johnson
have
visit
the
truman
at
one
point
as

in
a
memo
he
write
at
the
time
lbj
turn
to
ray
scherer
a
reporter
for
nbc
and
begin
berating
nbc
as
scandalously
prejudice
against
him
the
only
difference
between
the
kennedy
assassination
and
mine
be
that
i
be
alive
and
it
have
be
more
torturous
he
say
i
think
i
understand
the
press
a
lot
more
than
the
press
understands
me

over
here
until
after
the
convention
my
mother
be
have
an
operation

be
very
concerned
after

eighty
one
and
basically
wheelchair
bound
from
arthritis
but
she
still
have
a
lot
of
mental
energy
and
her
old
emotional
approach
to
issue
i
sat
with
her
the
even
before
the
operation
and
try
to
chat
about
thing
that
would
keep
her
mind
off
it
the
question
of
bobby
kennedy
have
become
an
emotional
one
for
her
mother

him
with
an
intensity
that
only
she
could
muster

of
stay
calm

kept
revert
to
bobby
attack
him
savagely
i
like
him
very
much
and
found
it
difficult
to
listen
to
her
tirade
against
him
finally
i
say
firmly
that
we
have
to
change
the
subject
and
the
moment
pass
the
next
morning
my
brother

with
her
as
she
begin
to
emerge
from
the

the
situation
in
washington
deteriorate
throughout
the
night
of
his
assassination
i
stayed
at
the
paper
and
several
of
us
climbed
up
onto
the
roof
to
look
out
over
the
city
at
the
large
fire
especially
on
th
street
near
the
post

take
place
everywhere
finally
over
fourteen
thousand

full
contingent
of
nearly
three
thousand

that

carmichael
be
organize
a
mob
at
th
and
u
to
march
on
georgetown
and
burn
it
down
joe
recall
that
president
johnson
read
the
report
smile
and
say
goddamn
i
ve
wait
thirty
five
year
for
this
day
preserve
his
sense
of
humor
in
the
middle
of
the
riot
while
vent
his
ever
present
disdain
for
what
he
view
as
an
elitist
enclave
the
phone
rang
in
my
bedroom
very
early
on
the
morning
of
june
ben
be
call
to
tell
me
that
bobby
kennedy
have
be
shot
add
we
need
to
stop
the
press
and
replate
with
the
story
jim
daly
refuse
to
stop
the
press
and
i
think
you
have
well
get
down
here
daly
the
post
s
general
manager
be
haunt
by
the
prospect
of
late
delivery
and
dissatisfied
subscriber
i
arrive
at
the
plant
and
found
harry
gladstein
the
circulation
director
on
the
back
platform
and
ask
him
what
our
alternative
be
we
decide
that
since
it
be
already
a
m
beyond
our
usual
delivery
hour
we
would
go
ahead
and
deliver
the
paper
that
have
be
print
and
then
recover
the
route
with
a
special
edition
it
would
be
expensive
of
course
but
if
we
want
to
tell
our
reader
about
this
shatter
piece
of
news
this
be
what
we
have
to
do
my
decision
to
proceed
cause
yet
another
problem
in
my
relationship
with
john
sweeterman
i
should
have
checked
with
him
but
i
be
there
on
the
spot
and
simply
didn
t
think
in
that
kind
of
managerial
way
in
fact
john
have
be
on
his
way
in
to
the
paper
and
when
he
get
there
he
say
to
me
icily
i
hear
you
ve
be
give
order
on
the
load
dock
i
say
i
have
and
that
time
we
both
retreat
i
imagine
that
john
would
have
give
the
same
order
because
he
be
always
willing
to
spend
money
when
it
matter
and
it
clearly
matter
in
this
case
another
change
in
a
relationship
take
place
at
the
time
bobby
die
this
one
not
directly
connect
with
me
but
with
the
paper
herblock
have
drawn

by
that
time
herb
be
so
powerful
and
respect
that
he
could
get
away
with
flaunt
his

funeral
the
follow
day
at
st

a
highly
emotional
service

by
an
equally
wrench
ride
back
to
washington
on
the
funeral
train
for
the
burial
in
arlington
cemetery
the
memory
of
that
day
be
sear
into
my
mind
watch
the
mourner
line
the
railroad
track
and
the
weep
people
in
the
station
and
make
the
sad
climb
up
to
the
spot
on
the
hill
in
the
cemetery
beside
where
his
brother
be
bury
to
me
bobby
be
a
complex
character
he
could
be
very
tough
as
he
be
and
probably
have
to
be
as
jfk
s
campaign
manager
we
have
occasionally
be
at
odds
and
he
have
once
reduce
me
to
tear
over
a
piece
on
jackie
kennedy
that
have
appear
in
the
post
at
a
dinner
at
joe
alsop

sharply
to
me
you
have
lose
your
husband
too
you
should
know
well
his
comment
cause
joe
to
shake
his
head
and
mutter
it
s
like
a
young
nephew
attack
his
rich
old
aunt
we
have
both
get
past
that
and
become
friend
like
thousand
of
others

and
change
and
become
a
significant
political
figure
relate
to
people
with
a
charisma
different
from
but
as
compelling
as
jfk
s
though
i
have
some
concern
about
bobby
s
position
on
certain
issue
he
have
become
a
passionate
and
articulate
advocate
for
many
of
the
thing
in
which
i
deeply
believe
much
of
the
summer
of
be
take
up
with
political
matter
of
one
kind
or
another
without

return
to
political
life
he

a
number
of
image
problem
to
overcome
and
have
work
throughout
the
primary
season
to
accomplish
that
in
mid
july
he
come
to
an
editorial
lunch
at
the
post
among
those
who
attend
be
don
graham
safely
back
from
vietnam
only
a
week
earlier
as
well
as
several
reporter
and
editor
rockefeller
have
be
there
the
week
before
arrive
for
lunch
with
an
entourage
of
sort
nixon
come
alone
he
begin
by
say
how
glad
he
be
to
be
at
the
post
and
welcome
the
gathering
i
mention
that
i
thought
he
and
i
have
first
met
in
no
kay
he
say
confidently
it
be
we
met
at
that
marvelous
house
of
your
parent
there
be
a
lot
of
very
prominent
people
there
and
i
couldn
t
figure
out
what
i
a
very
poor
congressman
be
do
in
that
company
we
sat
down
to
lunch
which
nixon
refuse
to
eat
on
the
ground
that
he
have
to
watch
his
weight
i
persuade
him
to
have
some
iced
coffee
which
he
take
but
never
touch
at
least
two
people
make
note
after
the
lunch
and
two
memo
one
from
an
editor
al
horne
and
one
from
ward
just
have
survive
which
recall
what
we
discuss
and
what
nixon
say
at
the
time
he
felt
confident
that
he
would
win
the
nomination
on
the
first
ballot
and
comment
that
rockefeller
have
even
less
chance
with
the
republican
than
mccarthy
do
with
the
democrat
he
be
already
think
about
his
run
mate
but
knew
it
would
depend
on
which
state
he
need
to
win
the
general
election
he
mention
several
possibility
spiro
agnew
not
among
them
he
offer
the
opinion
that
humphrey
would
do
best
if
he
ran
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
administration
s
record
which
turn
out
to
be
accurate
but
humphrey
separate
himself
from
johnson
too
late
to
make
much
difference
on
the
vietnam
war
nixon
felt
that
thing
have
change
a
great
deal
since
he
be
last
in
a
position
of
power
that
the
domino
theory
wasn
t
as
valid
in
as
it
have
be
he
also
recognize
that
the
public
clearly
want
to
end
the
war
but
that
the
new
president
have
to
hold
out
for
some
kind
of
honorable
settlement
nixon
handle
himself
so
brilliantly
throughout
the
lunch
that
we
be
all
truly
impressed
meg
greenfield
who
have
only
just
come
to
the
paper
say
she
d
have
to
go
home
and
lie
down
to
think
over
what
she
d
see
and
heard
geyelin
in
reflect
on
this
episode
later
say
he
thought
it
be
one
of
those
rare
moment
in
nixon
s
life
when
he
didn
t
feel
threaten
by
anybody
he
be
on
top
of
the
world
with
the
convention
all
lock
up
but
as
soon
as
he
get
to
miami
at
the
slightest
challenge
from
rockefeller
and
reagan
nixon
begin
to
feel
threaten
worry
that
those
two
would
somehow
get
together
and
stop
him
it
be
then
that
he
turn
mean
again
accord
to
phil
i
attend
the
republican
convention
and
witness
nixon
s
nomination
an
extraordinary
comeback
from
his
defeat
for
the
governorship
in
california
later
steve
and
i
flew
together
to
chicago
right
into
the
stress
of
the
democratic
convention
humphrey
emerge
the
winner
over
mccarthy
the
peace
candidate
but
the
chaotic
convention
hurt
him
mortally
go
into
the
fall
campaign
few
would
soon
forget
the
image
of
the
violence
of
the
demonstration
outside
in
the
street
which
i
witness
close
up
along

at

we
stuck
by
our
policy
of
nonendorsement
at
least
in
theory
in
effect
we
support
humphrey
indirectly
by
say
in
our
editorial
if
you
believe
in
this
or
that
then
you
ll
want
to
vote
for
x
or
y
at
the
time
of
nixon
s
nomination
the
post
have
carry
an
editorial
say
that
he
have
show
an
admirable
understand
and
restraint
in
his
public
approach
to
vietnam
a
commendable
comprehension
of
some
aspect
of
the
nation
s
social
ill
however
it
also
say
that
in
private
he
have
reveal
a
disquiet
disregard
for
principle
not
to
say
good
sense
in
his
discussion
of
the
war
of
the
court
of
open
housing
and
gun
control
and
other
thing
as
well
as
we
ought
to
know
him
by
now
he
remains
remarkably
unknown
we
have
also
editorialize
about
nixon
s
choice
of
a
run
mate
in
an
editorial
title
the
peril
of
spiro
we
say
give
enough
time
nixon
s
decision
to
name
agnew
as
his
run
mate
may
come
to
be
regard
as
perhaps
the
most
eccentric
political
appointment
since
the
roman
emperor
caligula
name
his
horse
a
consul
ward
just
then
write
editorial
write
this
one
and
also
say
y
ou
can
view
agnew
with
alarm
or
you
can
point
to
him
with
pride
but
for
now
we
prefer
to
look
on
with
horrify
fascination
my
mother
ever
the
political
commentator
write
me
before
the
election
send
along
a
form
letter
she
have
receive
from
nixon
that
have
be
address
to
my
fellow
citizen
of
the
jewish
faith
and
extend
jewish
new
year
s
greeting
she
append
the
note
i
do
think
that
he
give
the
washington
post
more
opportunity
for
humor
than
the
editorial
department
realizes
hubert
humphrey
have
become
a
friend
of
mine
i
admire
him
greatly
and
feel
he
would
have
make
an
ideal
president
humphrey
however
have
never
be
a
favorite
of
lyndon
johnson
s
who
consider
him
gabby
go
so
far
as
to
remark
often
to
jack
valenti
those
people
from
minnesota
they
just
can
t
keep
their
mouth
shut
lbj
felt
humphrey
s
gabbiness
get
him
into
trouble
because
he
end
up
leak
information
that
cost
the
administration
he
didn
t
think
that
humphrey
leak
deliberately
but
that
he
be
so
effervescent
he
would
talk
when
he
should
have
be
listen
of
course
johnson
be
right
about
humphrey
s
be
effusive
but
he
could
also
be
remarkably
eloquent
reduce
people
to
laughter
and
tear
almost
simultaneously
he
often
make
off
the
cuff
brilliant
remark
but
then
would
not
be
able
to
stop
and
would
go
on
and
on
until
the
dazzle
effect
wore
off
and
the
audience
grow
restless
instead
of
mesmerize
hubert
s
save
grace
be
his
humor
he
be
just
incredibly
funny
and
i
found
him
to
be
a
wonderful
companion
always
but
despite
humphrey
s
attractive
quality
richard
nixon
be
elect
in
one
of
our
closest
election
phil
geyelin
write
the
post
s
editorial
on
nixon
s
victory
say
he
have
fully
earn
the
opportunity
to
test
himself
he
have
also
earn
encouragement
cooperation
good
wish
and
an
open
mind
among
those
whose
security
and
welfare
have
be
place
in
such
large
measure
in
his
hand
even
herblock
provide
nixon
with
a
honeymoon
however
short
in
his
cartoon
throughout
the
campaign
indeed
throughout
nixon
s
entire
political
career
herb
have
drawn
him
with
a
five
o
clock
shadow
that
seem
to
grow
darker
as
the
week
and
year
go
by
become
almost
a
beard
at
some
point
rus
wiggins
have
sent
herb
a
razor
suggest
that
maybe
it
be
time
to
give
nixon
a
shave
when
we
discuss
the
beard
at
an
editorial
conference
one
day
herb
point
to
a
picture
of
nixon
in
that
day
s
paper
which
clearly
show
a
heavy
growth
of
beard
to
be
a
distinguish
feature
of
the
man
he
claimed
that
the
dark
face
be
a
characteristic
like
any
other
large
ear
a
prominent
nose
whatever
and
therefore
fair
game
for
a
cartoonist
actually
herb
s
cartoon
that
appear
after
election
day
make
it
clear
he
recognize
that
a
president
of
the
united
state
have
to
be
handle
somewhat
differently
from
a
candidate
for
the
office
he
drew
his
own
office
as
a
barbershop
with
a
sign
on
the
wall
that
read
this
shop
give
to
every
new
president
of
the
united
state
a
free
shave
h
block
proprietor
much
have
be
go
on
at
the
post
while
this
political
year
proceed
typically
and
modestly
rus
have
notify
me
in
june
that
he
would
indeed
retire
on
his
sixty
fifth
birthday
without
any
undue
fanfare
or
attention
at
the
end
of
the
year
as
rus
explain
in
his
letter
to
me
he
have
a
personal
distaste
for
a
lot
of
flap
and
also
felt
that
this
way
would
be
well
for
the
institution
i
write
rus
that
i
literally
could
not
imagine
the
post
without
him
of
all
the
helpful
people
there
when
i
be
new
to
my
job
rus
be
the
most
helpful
the
nice
thing
you
do
be
to
take
me
seriously
when
a
lot
of
people
wouldn
t
have
but
not
too
seriously
which
be
just
right
in
fact
rus
left
earlier
than
expect
because
president
johnson
appoint
him
ambassador
to
the
united
nation
in
late
september
it
have
be
twenty
one
year
since
rus
s
arrival
at
the
post
and
it
be
a
wrench
for
me
to
see
him
leave
rus
s
departure
cause
a
series
of
change
in
the
structure
of
our
organization
and
in
the
management
of
the
news
and
editorial
side
of
the
post
be
nonpolitical
and
nonpartisan
ben
be
gear
to
hard
news
and
never
much
interested
in
editorial
so
when
he
become
executive
editor
after
rus
left
we
both
agree
that
the
editorial
page
which
be
now
under
phil
geyelin
should
report
to
me
rather
than
to
him
i
didn
t
know
meg
greenfield
very
well
then
and
at
first
i
be
puzzle
that
phil
take
her
everywhere
with
him
meg
rapidly
make
her
own
place
in
the
organization
and
only
ten
month
after
she
have
come
to
the
paper
i
sent
phil
a
note
say
i
d
be
think
about
the
necessity
for
him
to
have
a
no
eventually
and
wonder
if
it
might
be
meg
or
do
you
discriminate
or
would
she
hate
it
just
a
year
after
she
arrive
phil
name
her
deputy
editor
of
the
editorial
page
i
give
him
great
credit
for
appreciate
meg
s
amaze
mind
and
extraordinary
ability
both
to
write
and
to
edit
and
her
prodigious
capacity
for
work
it
be
foresighted
of
phil
to
make
her
his
deputy
well
ahead
of
upward
mobility
for
woman
for
phil
meg
be
a
real
partner
he
once
described
their
work
together
as
be
like
two
people
at
the
piano
play
chopstick
these
year
be
fill
with
executive
turnover
the
blame
for
which
be
often
laid
at
my
doorstep
sometimes
incorrectly
one
instance
where
ben
do
the
hire
and
the
let
go
take
place
when
he
become
executive
editor
of
the
post
and
his
job
of
manage
editor
fell
open
ben
brought
in
gene
patterson
the
former
manage
editor
of
the
atlanta
constitution
who
have
a
reputation
for
the
kind
of
independent
mind
tough
straight
edit
we
all
admire
but
over
a
three
year
period
a
combination
of
mismatch
temperament
overlap
responsibility
and
newsroom
politics
convince
ben
that
thing
weren
t
work
out
he
air
his
doubt
to
gene
and
gene
resign
immediately
when
he
left
the
post
gene
sum
up
his
feeling
by
say
ben
bradlee
need
a
manage
editor
like
a
boar
need
tit
this
be
a
quote
that
amuse
ben
vastly
but
it
accurately
spell
out
what
gene
have
long
suspect
there
be
no
job
there
miraculously
we
all
stayed
friend
a
remarkable
tribute
to
gene
s
classy
lovely
character
howard
simon
then
deputy
manage
editor
move
right
up
when
gene
left
and
accommodate
himself
to
ben
s
personality
and
ben
s
way
he
be
willing
and
able
to
do
the
job
as
ben
define
it
to
do
the
thing
ben
didn
t
and
wouldn
t
do
either
because
they
bore
him
or
because
his
attention
be
elsewhere
it
would
have
be
hard
to
portray
this
relationship
accurately
on
an
organization
chart
but
theirs
be
a
partnership
that
work
well
fortunately
howard
have
talent
complementary
to
ben
s
he
be
especially
interested
in
what
he
irreverently
dubbed
smersh
science
medicine
education
religion
and
all
that
shit
and
he
create
and
head
a
group
of
reporter
who
begin
to
look
more
closely
at
these
area
and
to
report
on
them
more
fully
he
be
a
great
hand
holder
and
he
developed
many
young
people
whom
he
spot
hire
and
tracked
and
he
have
a
droll
pixie
humor
which
delighted
us
over
the
year
increasingly
i
found
the
confidence
to
pas
along
idea
or
criticism
or
praise
of
story
that
appear
in
the
post
or
newsweek
and
i
get
great
pleasure
if
a
story
idea
i
have
pass
on
to
the
editor
eventually
make
it
into
print
and
have
some
impact
howard
recognize
my
gratification
in
these
small
thing
and
tease
me
occasionally
with
a
brenda
starr
award
for
reporting
in
true
brenda
fashion
i
once
give
a
story
to
ben
that
he
later
regret
not
trust
me
on
truman
capote
have
confide
in
me
that
he
knew
jackie
kennedy
be
go
to
marry
aristotle
onassis
an
enormous
story
if
true
i
call
ben
from
south
america
where
i
be
on
a
trip
and
told
him
i
be
sure
truman
be
right
ben
cable
back
you
re
great
brenda
but
i
chickened
source
confirm
but
everyone
else
reach
and
we
reach
score
most
skeptical
and
i
decide
twas
too
thin
a
reed
to
stake
the
paper
s
reputation
of
course
truman
be
right
and
the
post
miss
my
scoop
fortunately
ben
and
i
didn
t
hold
incident
like
this
against
each
other
howard
be
also
a
constant
fount
of
idea
some
good
some
not
so
good
he
kept
me
well
stock
with
thing
to
think
about
for
the
future
of
the
paper
he
sent
me
countless
memo
about
his
idea
for
improve
the
post
never
mince
word
and
once
preface
his
comment
by
say
eat
this
after
reading
it
be
howard
who
suggest
explore
the
publication
of
a
weekly
magazine
to
be
distribute
in
the
friday
morning
post
in
essence
the
weekend
section
which
remains
an
important
feature
of
the
paper
howard
often
address
his
memo
to
me
as
mama
a
nickname
both
he
and
ben
use
although
with
ben
it
be
usually
mum
it
didn
t
bother
me
in
fact
i
like
it
the
team
of
ben
and
howard
function
smoothly
for
many
year
and
only
begin
to
unravel
after
watergate
i
have
lose
one
old
friend
and
important
person
at
the
post
when
rus
left
in
the
fall
of
and
toward
the
end
of
that
same
year
john
sweeterman
told
me
that
he
want
to
be
relieve
of
his
day
to
day
publishing
responsibility
in
effect
to
retire
despite
my
difficulty
with
him
i
be
fully
aware
of
all
he
have
do
and
be
do
for
the
paper
how
essential
he
have
be
from
his
arrival
in
when
the
post
be
a
lose
paper
through
the
merger
to
our
present
position
of
stability
and
strength
fritz
and
i
both
try
to
dissuade
him
but
he
remain
firm
later
he
told
me
that
he
be
tire
and
have
have
it
sort
of
i
just
want
the
freedom
when
i
realize
he
be
serious
we
name
him
to
the
newly
create
post
of
vice
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
company
to
be
concerned
with
planning
for
the
future
development
of
all
of
its
division
i
also
ask
him
to
help
me
find
someone
to
replace
him
john
say
that
i
could
and
should
become
the
publisher
at
the
time
i
be
president
of
the
company
and
held
no
title
at
the
paper
my
immediate
response
be
to
say
that
i
couldn
t
and
that
we
d
have
to
find
someone
but
john
be
adamant
with
trepidation
i
decide
to
take
the
title
which
my
father
and
phil
have
have
before
me
and
to
look
for
a
new
business
head
of
the
paper
but
i
hadn
t
the
remotest
idea
how
to
organize
a
search
that
would
evaluate
anyone
properly
i
still
didn
t
know
about
headhunter
nor
do
i
know
the
industry
i
didn
t
even
know
exactly
what
skill
the
job
call
for
after
sound
out
one
or
two
people
whom
i
knew
in
the
industry
i
turn
to
my
friend
bob
mcnamara
bob
recommend
paul
ignatius
who
have
be
the
secretary
of
the
navy
and
be
repute
to
have
gotten
the
supply
to
vietnam
the
quality
in
paul
that
be
described
to
me
by
people
he
have
work
with
range
from
imaginative
to
budget
mind
and
profit
orient
in
all
of
which
we
be
certainly
interested
he
have
also
be
in
charge
of
several
building
project
and
since
a
new
building
for
the
post
be
uppermost
on
my
mind
i
decide
this
be
a
good
fit
and
that
although
he
didn
t
know
the
newspaper
business
he
could
learn
it
so
i
hire
him
and
paul
come
on
board
as
president
of
the
newspaper
and
executive
vice
president
of
the
washington
post
company
in
january
almost
from
the
outset
his
tenure
be
troubled
it
be
a
painful
period
for
both
of
us
i
knew
he
wasn
t
go
to
work
out
six
month
into
the
arrangement
and
i
told
fritz
then
that
we
have
make
a
mistake
fritz
correctly
told
me
that
i
be
be
too
hasty
and
that
i
have
to
give
him
a
chance
and
we
carry
on
with
paul
well
into
john
s
departure
in
fact
ushered
in
a
very
difficult
period
for
me
problem
seem
to
arise
everywhere
and
i
found
manage
the
company
to
be
a
nearly
impossible
task
at
this
time
at
the
post
production
be
go
from
bad
to
bad
compound
by
increasingly
severe
labor
difficulty
at
newsweek
both
editorial
and
business
be
troubled
at
the
station
there
be
worry
about
profit
and
margin
none
of
this
be
happen
in
a
vacuum
i
felt
that
i
could
manage
one
problem
at
a
time
if
only
everything
else
would
hold
still
while
i
concentrate
on
it
but
no
the
whole
company
kept
spin
i
fret
that
i
wasn
t
up
to
it
that
all
the
quality
i
be
lack
add
up
to
an
overwhelm
deficiency
that
might
very
well
work
to
the
detriment
of
the
company
i
worried
that
the
company
might
actually
fail
and
i
stayed
worried
i
suffer
over
my
decision
and
my
nondecisions
my
sin
of
commission
as
well
as
my
sin
of
omission
of
the
many
mistake
i
make
along
the
way
the
one
that
torment
me
most
be
those
that
seem
to
be
write
in
concrete
like
building
and
labor
contract
which
at
least
felt
like
concrete
one
of
the
most
painful
episode
have
to
do
with
a
new
plant
for
the
paper
we
chose
i
m
pei
as
the
architect
but
waste
nearly
four
year
in
the
process
of
planning
and
design
an
elaborate
building
that
wasn
t
go
to
work
for
the
production
of
the
paper
in
the
end
not
only
we
but
pei
become
discourage
we
decide
to
cut
our
already
great
loss
and
stop
work
on
what
certainly
would
have
be
the
wrong
building
for
us
except
for
our
undue
haste
in
turn
again
to
the
less
distinguish
firm
that
have
built
the
original
structure
and
then
push
that
group
to
get
start
too
quickly
i
believe
that
drop
pei
s
firm
be
the
right
decision
for
us
despite
all
the
money
and
time
waste
it
be
the
right
decision
but
i
hat
it
ever
since
we
complete
the
building
in
i
have
have
the
most
ambivalent
feeling
about
the
structure
i
work
in
which
be
plain
dowdy
and
full
of
compromise
on
too
many
day
any
one
of
its
feature
remind
me
that
the
decision
make
process
and
my
role
in
it
have
be
poor
i
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
yet
despite
the
turmoil
and
self
doubt
many
thing
at
the
post
and
the
company
be
go
well
one
of
the
groundbreaking
achievement
at
the
paper
under
ben
s
direction
be
the
creation
of
the
style
section
replace
what
before
then
be
know
as
the
woman
s
section
and
call
for
and
about
woman
in
print
the
new
section
be
ben
s
idea
with
dave
laventhol
the
chief
implementer
dave
have
outline
what
it
should
include
people
rather
than
event
private
life
rather
than
public
affair
and
to
whom
it
should
be
address
washingtonian
of
both
sex
black
and
white
suburbanite
and
city
dweller
decision
maker
and
home
maker
prelaunch
the
section
be
call
trial
balloon
there
be
a
number
of
meeting
on
what
to
rename
it
until
ben
come
up
with
style
an
abbreviation
for
life
style
which
he
thought
be
a
bogus
word
and
this
be
adopt
when
style
first
appear
i
be
cautiously
optimistic
i
didn
t
like
some
of
what
i
saw
but
be
willing
to
reserve
final
judgment
fairly
soon
however
i
become
more
and
more
distressed
over
the
direction
the
new
section
be
take
but
i
be
unsure
how
to
criticize
constructively
something
i
want
to
improve
i
tend
to
apply
a
dentist
drill
too
frequently
instead
of
consider
thing
coolly
and
not
constantly
complain
one
of
ben
s
strength
be
that
he
stood
by
his
conviction
even
if
it
meant
stand
up
to
me
and
one
of
our
rare
square
offs
have
to
do
with
style
once
he
caution
me
give
us
time
it
s
come
another
time
he
say
to
me
sharply
get
your
finger
out
of
my
eye
a
stern
directive
that
shook
me
up
especially
because
he
have
always
be
so
good
temper
it
upset
me
enough
so
that
i
be
able
to
cool
down
i
realize
i
d
push
too
hard
i
have
improve
but
i
still
tend
only
to
see
what
be
wrong
and
to
ignore
what
be
right
what
be
right
be
that
we
have
broken
an
old
mold
and
be
invent
an
important
and
entirely
new
one
one
for
the
new
time
that
be
dawn
in
which
woman
s
and
men
s
interest
be
come
together
in
which
neither
one
nor
the
other
want
to
hear
about
woman
hold
teacup
around
a
table
or
as
ben
put
it
we
have
become
convince
that
traditional
woman
s
news
bore
the
as
off
all
of
us
one
more
picture
of
mr
dean
rusk
attend
the
national
day
of
some
embassy
of
them
and
we
d
cut
our
throat
thing
begin
to
straighten
out
style
go
through
a
series
of
editor
each
of
whom
add
something
to
it
until
finally
in
we
arrive
at
shelby
coffey
a
charm
southerner
who
be
a
born
writer
and
above
all
editor
writer
love
shelby
and
style
really
take
off
under
him
with
a
group
of
highly
talented
people
write
terrific
story
one
of
the
post
s
fine
talent
tom
shale
be
hire
and
developed
by
shelby
as
a
general
reporter
and
move
on
to
become
the
paper
s
television
critic
ben
also
hire
sally
quinn
and
she
begin
to
develop
into
a
first
rate
writer
initially
sally
have
be
interviewed
by
phil
geyelin
who
have
met
her
when
she
be
social
secretary
to
the
algerian
ambassador
phil
sent
her
on
to
ben
who
say
to
phil
she
s
fine
but
she
s
never
write
anything
in
her
life
phil
s
response
be
well
nobody
s
perfect
so
sally
arrive
totally
inexperienced
except
vicariously
through
a
relationship
with
journalist
warren
hoge
of
the
new
york
time
she
told
the
story
of
be
paralyze
by
have
to
cover
a
party
on
her
first
day
on
the
job
she
call
warren
and
say
i
m
on
a
deadline
and
i
m
have
a
nervous
breakdown
he
suggest
she
pretend
that
she
be
on
the
telephone
to
a
friend
and
just
talk
about
the
party
that
first
piece
come
out
very
chatty
as
sally
say
people
like
that
because
it
be
fun
and
easy
to
read
i
felt
as
if
i
have
come
home
after
the
first
few
week
i
realize
that
this
be
what
i
m
suppose
to
be
henry
kissinger
in
a
fit
of
pique
once
say
to
me
refer
to
how
he
felt
when
his
name
be
mention
in
style
maxine
cheshire
the
gossip
columnist
make
me
want
to
commit
murder
but
sally
make
me
want
to
commit
suicide
what
he
meant
be
that
sally
have
a
gift
for
make
people
feel
free
to
talk
to
her
and
then
hang
them
with
their
own
word
as
she
progress
her
profile
of
various
personality
become
the
talk
of
washington
on
occasion
she
almost
destroyed
people
with
the
strength
of
her
write
in
when
shelby
left
style
for
the
national
desk
he
be
succeed
by
mary
hadar
who
be
a
big
success
in
a
way
different
from
shelby
s
she
make
style
more
balance
and
easy
to
read
and
at
the
same
time
brought
along
her
own
writer
star
many
of
the
most
gift
come
to
cover
party
do
that
briefly
and
immediately
move
on
to
great
glory
style
now
under
david
von
drehle
remains
a
great
developer
of
skill
and
talent
not
only
be
style
right
for
us
but
the
concept
have
be
successfully
embrace
by
paper
all
over
the
country
chapter
twenty
one
when
in
i
become
publisher
of
the
post
as
well
as
president
of
the
company
my
plate
be
fuller
than
ever
i
have
partly
work
myself
into
the
job
but
not
except
for
rare
occasion
take
hold
i
have
acquire
some
sense
of
business
but
still
rely
on
others
more
than
most
company
president
do
one
article
write
about
me
that
appear
fully
five
year
after
i
d
go
to
work
say
mr
graham
accepts
her
responsibility
much
more
often
than
she
asserts
her
authority
that
be
true
i
didn
t
always
take
charge
or
handle
my
relationship
with
people
throughout
the
company
in
the
coolest
or
best
way
my
expectation
far
exceed
my
accomplishment
in
fact
the
year
from
the
mid
s
to
the
mid
s
rich
and
full
as
they
be
be
depress
for
me
in
many
way
i
seem
to
be
carry
inadequacy
as
baggage
when
i
thought
about
my
uncertainty
and
nervousness
a
scene
from
the
first
musical
comedy
i
d
ever
see
the
vagabond
king
kept
recur
to
me
there
be
a
moment
when
the
suddenly
enthrone
vagabond
appear
for
the
first
time
in
royal
robe
slowly
and
anxiously
descends
the
great
stair
tensely
eye
on
both
side
the
row
of
archer
with
their
drawn
bow
and
inscrutable
face
i
still
felt
like
a
pretender
to
the
throne
very
much
on
trial
i
felt
i
be
always
take
an
exam
and
would
fail
if
i
miss
a
single
answer
a
direct
question
about
something
like
newsweek
s
newsstand
circulation
would
flummox
me
completely
what
most
get
in
the
way
of
my
do
the
kind
of
job
i
want
to
do
be
my
insecurity
partly
this
arose
from
my
particular
experience
but
to
the
extent
that
it
stem
from
the
narrow
way
woman
s
role
be
define
it
be
a
trait
share
by
most
woman
in
my
generation
we
have
be
brought
up
to
believe
that
our
role
be
to
be
wife
and
mother
educate
to
think
that
we
be
put
on
earth
to
make
men
happy
and
comfortable
and
to
do
the
same
for
our
child
i
adopt
the
assumption
of
many
of
my
generation
that
woman
be
intellectually
inferior
to
men
that
we
be
not
capable
of
govern
lead
manage
anything
but
our
home
and
our
child
once
married
we
be
confine
to
run
house
provide
a
smooth
atmosphere
deal
with
child
support
our
husband
pretty
soon
this
kind
of
think
indeed
this
kind
of
life
take
its
toll
most
of
us
become
somehow
inferior
we
grow
less
able
to
keep
up
with
what
be
happen
in
the
world
in
a
group
we
remain
largely
silent
unable
to
participate
in
conversation
and
discussion
unfortunately
this
incapacity
often
produce
in
woman
as
it
do
in
me
a
diffuse
way
of
talk
an
inability
to
be
concise
a
tendency
to
ramble
to
start
at
the
end
and
work
backwards
to
overexplain
to
go
on
for
too
long
to
apologize
woman
traditionally
also
have
suffer
and
many
still
do
from
an
exaggerated
desire
to
please
a
syndrome
so
instill
in
woman
of
my
generation
that
it
inhibit
my
behavior
for
many
year
and
in
way
still
do
although
at
the
time
i
didn
t
realize
what
be
happen
i
be
unable
to
make
a
decision
that
might
displease
those
around
me
for
year
whatever
directive
i
may
have
issue
end
with
the
phrase
if
it
s
all
right
with
you
if
i
thought
i
d
do
anything
to
make
someone
unhappy
i
d
agonize
the
end
result
of
all
this
be
that
many
of
us
by
middle
age
arrive
at
the
state
we
be
try
most
to
avoid
we
bore
our
husband
who
have
do
their
fair
share
in
help
reduce
us
to
this
condition
and
they
wander
off
to
young
greener
pasture
when
i
first
go
to
work
i
be
still
handicapped
with
the
old
assumption
and
be
operating
as
though
they
be
write
in
stone
when
i
start
my
job
i
be
inferior
to
the
men
with
whom
i
be
work
i
have
no
business
experience
no
management
experience
and
little
knowledge
of
the
governmental
economic
political
or
other
matter
with
which
we
dealt
i
truly
felt
like
samuel
johnson
s
description
of
a
woman
minister
a
woman
preach
be
like
a
dog
s
walk
on
his
hinder
leg
it
be
not
do
well
but
you
be
surprised
to
find
it
do
at
all
since
i
regard
myself
as
inferior
i
fail
to
distinguish
between
on
the
one
hand
male
condescension
because
i
be
a
woman
and
on
the
other
hand
a
valid
view
that
the
only
reason
i
have
my
job
be
the
good
luck
of
my
birth
and
the
bad
luck
of
my
husband
s
death
be
a
woman
in
control
of
a
company
even
a
small
private
company
as
ours
be
then
be
so
singular
and
surprising
in
those
day
that
i
necessarily
stood
out
in
and
for
the
first
several
year
of
my
work
life
my
situation
be
certainly
unique
even
at
my
own
company
there
be
no
woman
manager
and
few
woman
professional
and
probably
no
woman
within
four
level
of
me
the
post
be
not
an
anomaly
rather
this
be
typical
of
the
time
the
business
world
be
essentially
close
to
woman
at
least
through
most
of
the
s
i
basically
live
in
a
man
s
world
hardly
speak
to
a
woman
all
day
except
to
the
secretary
but
i
be
almost
totally
unaware
of
myself
as
an
oddity
and
have
no
comprehension
of
the
difficulty
face
by
work
woman
in
our
organization
and
elsewhere
for
far
too
many
year
i
thought
my
handicap
be
entirely
due
to
my
be
new
and
untrained
and
attribute
none
of
my
problem
to
be
a
woman
early
in
i
be
ask
to
speak
at
the
woman
s
city
club
of
cleveland
someone
there
have
write
me
suggest
the
status
of
woman
as
a
topic
for
my
speech
my
response
to
the
president
of
the
club
reflect
my
view
about
operating
in
a
man
s
world
at
that
time
it
may
be
that
i
be
inevitably
saddle
with
this
subject
as
it
have
i
must
confess
come
up
before
it
be
one
in
which
i
be
honestly
not
interested
nor
educate
but
it
may
well
be
that
i
should
become
so
my
own
status
be
as
you
know
a
complete
accident
and
i
find
that
i
lead
a
man
s
life
so
completely
that
i
do
not
dwell
on
the
subject
much
if
you
really
insist
on
the
status
of
woman
i
ll
try
to
adjust
even
more
reveal
of
my
old
fashion
attitude
be
an
interview
i
do
with
woman
s
wear
daily
as
late
as
overall
the
piece
read
perfectly
sensibly
except
on
the
topic
of
woman
in
the
workplace
about
which
i
be
grossly
insensitive
the
report
portrays
me
with
the
editor
in
the
unconsciously
sexist
way
then
take
for
grant
kay
graham
join
in
the
by
play
but
do
not
dominate
it
prefer
to
let
the
men
an
assertive
group
play
the
star
role
it
be
a
small
slice
of
her
life
one
in
which
assertive
strong
will
men
have
played
a
major
part
i
rely
on
fritz
s
and
other
men
s
judgment
in
every
decision
i
think
be
a
woman
may
have
be
a
drawback
for
the
job
unless
you
re
a
career
woman
which
i
wasn
t
my
generation
of
woman
really
didn
t
have
the
seriousness
to
work
girl
now
be
more
serious
about
their
career
would
i
urge
that
a
woman
be
appoint
to
an
executive
job
i
haven
t
really
be
face
with
that
but
i
think
it
s
a
matter
of
appropriateness
i
can
t
see
a
woman
as
manage
editor
of
a
newspaper
i
guess
it
s
a
man
s
world
in
the
world
today
men
be
more
able
than
woman
at
executive
work
and
in
certain
situation
i
think
a
man
would
be
well
at
this
job
i
m
in
than
a
woman
the
day
the
woman
s
wear
piece
appear
elsie
carper
the
longtime
post
reporter
and
editor
and
my
friend
march
fiercely
into
my
office
and
say
in
response
to
the
last
line
do
you
really
believe
that
because
if
you
do
i
quit
that
shook
me
up
i
saw
her
point
but
for
me
an
understand
of
the
real
heart
of
woman
s
issue
surface
only
later
and
far
too
gradually
professionally
i
remain
very
isolated
as
a
woman
and
have
no
one
in
my
work
world
to
talk
with
about
these
thing
certainly
not
in
the
upper
reach
of
the
newspaper
industry
the
organization
that
i
join
when
i
go
to
work
the
trade
association
call
the
bureau
of
advertising
become
the
first
of
many
over
the
year
in
which
i
be
the
only
woman
meeting
be
especially
hard
for
me
as
a
woman
alone
because
they
take
place
over
several
day
and
often
be
held
at
resort
create
problem
of
a
social
nature
whom
to
join
at
dinner
what
to
do
if
nothing
be
plan
what
to
do
when
the
men
pair
off
or
go
in
group
one
of
the
most
awkward
occasion
for
me
be
the
bureau
s
annual
trip
to
detroit
for
a
meeting
with
official
from
the
automobile
industry
needle
to
say
a
totally
male
group
at
the
time
for
several
year
i
stuck
out
like
a
sore
thumb
there
be
always
the
most
acute
discomfort
and
self
consciousness
about
my
presence
in
a
room
one
speaker
after
another
use
to
start
his
presentation
coyly
by
say
lady
and
gentleman
or
gentleman
and
mr
graham
always
with
slight
giggle
or
snicker
it
make
me
extremely
uncomfortable
and
i
long
to
be
omit
or
at
least
not
single
out
at
one
bureau
meeting
a
friend
of
mine
be
preside
over
a
discussion
of
an
issue
totally
new
to
me
to
my
horror
he
decide
to
go
around
the
table
ask
each
individual
for
his
view
i
be
sit
on
his
right
and
he
start
at
his
left
which
give
me
time
to
try
to
think
what
to
say
while
listen
to
what
everyone
else
have
to
say
when
he
get
all
the
way
around
the
table
and
we
have
heard
from
everyone
but
me
he
just
stop
and
act
as
if
i
wasn
t
there
maybe
he
thought
he
be
be
kind
believe
i
have
nothing
to
add
there
be
a
brief
pause
and
then
we
all
laugh
i
shakily
say
something
and
the
moment
pass
at
the
time
i
didn
t
know
whether
i
be
more
relieve
at
not
have
to
make
a
comment
or
more
upset
at
be
ignore
i
often
observe
that
at
time
woman
be
invisible
to
men
who
look
right
through
you
as
though
you
weren
t
there
i
once
mention
this
syndrome
to
peter
derow
one
of
newsweek
s
executive
later
i
found
he
be
host
an
event
for
chief
executive
officer
who
be
or
might
become
newsweek
advertiser
a
typical
promotion
to
which
i
hadn
t
be
invite
i
inquire
politely
why
he
hadn
t
include
me
in
this
meeting
which
be
be
held
in
washington
especially
since
i
be
the
ceo
of
his
own
company
you
remember
tell
me
about
the
meeting
where
men
look
right
through
you
peter
reply
well
that
s
the
reason
oddly
i
be
still
insecure
enough
to
let
this
pas
each
time
i
be
the
only
woman
in
a
room
full
of
men
i
suffer
l
i
appear
stupid
or
ignorant
and
yet
i
have
to
admit
that
as
much
as
i
may
have
be
discomfit
by
be
the
only
woman
in
most
of
the
meeting
i
attend
as
time
go
on
there
be
part
of
me
that
quite
like
it
i
actually
confess
to
a
friend
at
the
time
that
it
s
spoil
and
fun
to
be
the
first
in
the
door
an
extreme
example
of
my
acceptance
of
traditional
notion
of
men
s
and
woman
s
role
and
realm
be
a
frivolous
but
basic
one
in
washington
and
elsewhere
where
large
social
dinner
be
give
men
and
woman
automatically
separate
after
eat
the
men
usually
remain
at
the
din
room
table
discuss
serious
matter
over
brandy
and
cigar
while
the
woman
retreat
to
the
living
room
or
the
hostess
s
bedroom
to
powder
their
nose
and
gossip
mostly
about
child
and
house
woman
s
interest
as
they
be
then
consider
i
remember
hearing
a
story
that
once
cissy
patterson
on
be
herd
off
with
the
other
woman
after
dinner
say
to
her
hostess
let
s
hurry
through
this
i
have
no
household
problem
and
my
daughter
be
grown
but
she
too
accepted
this
ancient
custom
as
do
i
long
after
i
have
go
to
work
and
be
engage
in
discuss
political
business
or
world
affair
with
many
of
these
same
men
by
day
at
night
after
dinner
i
would
mindlessly
take
myself
off
with
the
rest
of
the
woman
even
in
my
own
house
finally
one
night
at
joe
alsop
s
something
snap
i
realize
that
i
have
work
all
day
participate
in
an
editorial
issue
lunch
and
be
not
only
deeply
involve
in
but
be
actually
interested
in
what
be
go
on
in
the
world
yet
i
be
be
ask
to
spend
up
to
an
hour
wait
to
rejoin
the
men
that
night
at
joe
s
he
be
especially
guilty
of
keep
the
men
around
his
table
i
told
him
i
be
sure
he
would
understand
if
i
quietly
left
when
the
woman
be
dismiss
far
from
understand
joe
be
upset
defensively
he
insist
that
the
separation
didn
t
last
a
full
hour
but
only
long
enough
for
the
men
to
go
to
the
bathroom
i
maintain
that
that
be
nonsense
that
i
like
early
evening
that
i
look
forward
to
my
reading
and
far
that
i
wasn
t
try
to
tell
him
what
to
do
but
only
state
what
i
want
to
do
joe
couldn
t
accept
the
idea
of
my
leave
and
promise
that
if
i
stayed
he
would
let
everyone
men
and
woman
remain
at
the
table
my
action
didn
t
come
as
the
result
of
some
major
philosophical
stance
rather
it
simply
occur
to
me
that
i
could
use
that
after
dinner
hour
well
by
go
home
and
reading
the
early
edition
of
the
paper
but
clearly
my
work
experience
have
at
last
combine
with
the
influence
of
the
increasingly
strong
woman
s
movement
i
have
have
no
intention
of
start
a
revolution
but
my
action
do
indeed
trigger
a
minor
social
coup
as
news
of
my
innocent
suggestion
spread
because
i
be
regard
as
a
conservative
on
these
social
issue
my
stance
be
particularly
effective
the
illogic
of
expect
woman
to
leave
while
men
held
meaningful
discussion
become
obvious
and
the
practice
gradually
broke
up
all
over
town
there
be
no
single
dramatic
moment
that
alter
my
view
about
woman
rather
i
just
begin
to
focus
on
the
real
issue
surround
the
woman
s
movement
however
slow
i
be
to
learn
no
doubt
much
too
slow
to
suit
many
woman
i
finally
become
increasingly
aware
and
involve
look
back
i
can
t
understand
except
in
the
context
of
the
time
why
i
wasn
t
quicker
to
recognize
the
problem
think
thing
through
with
meg
greenfield
help
a
great
deal
she
and
i
come
at
woman
s
issue
from
different
perspective
but
with
surprisingly
similar
attitude
meg
have
make
it
before
woman
s
liberation
in
her
early
day
at
the
post
she
have
a
sign
on
her
office
door
that
say
if
liberate
i
will
not
serve
but
she
face
many
of
the
same
prejudice
in
her
office
that
i
do
in
mine
we
try
to
articulate
our
idea
together
she
once
add
a
p
s
to
a
note
about
something
else
i
have
be
try
to
work
out
a
position
any
position
on
woman
s
lib
but
i
fear
that
even
move
toward
the
spirit
of
the
thing
somewhat
i
be
irredeemably
uncle
tom
do
you
suppose
there
s
a
book
one
should
read
we
do
indeed
get
a
bunch
of
book
include
the
second
sex
by
simone
de
beauvoir
and
read
them
and
improve
our
attitude
she
go
on
think
about
these
matter
and
heartily
agree
with
what
be
probably
the
first
post
editorial
comment
on
woman
s
issue
in
this
era
in
august
of
under
the
title
not
such
a
long
way
baby
we
write
about
a
sportswriter
elinor
kaine
who
have
be
bar
from
the
press
box
at
some
football
stadium
unable
to
cover
the
game
she
have
take
her
case
to
court
the
post

read

baby
as
the
tv
commercial
would
have
you
believe
have
come
a
long
way
after
discuss
salary
and
other
inequality
the
editorial
note
the
woman
s
liberation
movement
which
begin
a
few
year
ago
as
a
fragile
feminine
caucus
be
spread
and
say
that
countless
woman
who
be
previously
resign
to
their
role
in
this
case
often
as
slave
or
salve
to
the
male
ego
now
see
that
school
business
church
and
government
all
exploit
or
oppress
woman
in
some
way
the
editorial
write
by
a
liberate
man
suggest
legal
and
social
remedy
but
conclude
that
perhaps
we
can
begin
with
the
ultra
radical
notion
that
a
woman
be
a
human
be
my
friendship
with
gloria
steinem
be
also
an
important
influence
in
my
think
be
young
she
have
be
shape
by
the
s
a
very
different
time
from
my
own
frame
of
reference
i
have
watch
the
burgeon
woman
s
movement
of
which
she
be
a
distinguish
leader
from
afar
at
first
and
be
put
off
by
the
pioneer
feminist
who
necessarily
i
now
suspect
take
extreme
position
to
make
their
crucial
point
about
the
essential
equality
of
woman
i
couldn
t
understand
militancy
and
disliked
the
kind
of
bra
burning
symbolism
that
appear
to
me
like
man
hat
i
remember
be
repel
by
a
new
york
magazine
cover
show
young
abby
rockefeller
with
a
belligerent
raise
fist
to
illustrate
a
story
on
feminism
this
kind
of
thing
make
me
overlook
the
real
issue
and
think
that
there
be
something
wrong
with
the
whole
movement
as
time
pass
gloria
more
than
any
other
individual
change
my
mind
set
and
help
me
grasp
what
the
leader
of
the
movement
and
even
the
extremist
be
talk
about
i
remember
her
first
effort
to
talk
with
me
seriously
about
the
issue
my
response
be
no
thanks
that
s
not
for
me
she
persist
however
i
recall
her
encourage
me
to
throw
off
some
of
the
myth
associate
with
my
old
style
think
she
say
that
s
general
motor
passing
through
our
womb
you
know
it
go
from
our
father
to
our
son
but
there
be
this
kind
of
authentic
self
in
there
that
be
a
guide
if
it
s
not
too
squelch
and
if
we
re
not
too
scar
to
listen
to
it
i
be
pretty
certain
that
whatever
authentic
self
i
may
have
have
have
be
pretty
well
squelch
but
gloria
kept
tell
me
that
if
i
come
to
understand
what
the
woman
s
movement
be
all
about
it
would
make
my
life
much
well
in
time
it
inevitably
dawn
on
me
and
how
right
she
be
later
when
gloria
come
to
me
for
fund
to
start
up
m
magazine
i
put
up
for
seed
money
to
help
her
get
go
more
effective
even
than
gloria
be
my
personal
experience
in
the
workplace
and
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
many
room
into
which
i
walk
board
on
which
i
sat
meeting
i
attend
as
the
only
woman
i
saw
endless
example
within
our
own
company
of
how
woman
be
view
both
the
post
and
newsweek
certainly
operate
in
the
old
way
assume
that
white
men
be
the
chosen
one
to
run
the
business
and
edit
the
news
both
organization
be
totally
male
orient
on
the
business
advertising
and
production
side
and
predominantly
so
on
the
editorial
side
to
much
too
great
an
extent
i
accepted
this
as
the
way
the
world
work
liz
peer
be
one

be
that
one
come
to
share
the
conviction
of
the
majority
that
one
be
less
able
less
intelligent
less
educable
less
worthy
of
responsibility
my
sentiment
exactly
to
my
surprise
all
this
be
become
very
much
a
part
of
me
though
i
be
still
simplistic
in
my
think
i
be
begin
to
understand
the
seriousness
and
complexity
of
the
issue
obviously
i
be
in
a
good
position
not
only
to
think
about
the
problem
of
woman
in
the
workplace
but
to
do
something
about
them
as
i
begin
to
understand
more
i
also
begin
to
acknowledge
my
responsibility
i
do
try
in
some
small
way
some
large
to
do
something
about
raise
the
visibility
of
woman
and
increase
the
sensitivity
toward
matter
of
particular
concern
to
them
as
a
manager
i
be
aware
of
the
issue
but
have
no
clear
idea
how
to
lean
on
male
chauvinist
manager
to
make
change
i
felt
that
i
and
other
woman
in
management
position
have
a
special
duty
to
bury
the
old
prejudice
first
by
refuse
to
accept
them
and
then
by
refute
them
wherever
and
whenever
we
encounter
them
attitude
need
to
be
modify
on
both
side
woman
have
accepted
the
dubious
assumption
and
myth
about
themselves
for
much
too
long
and
men
have
to
be
help
to
break
out
of
the
assumption
of
which
they
too
be
victim
i
work
hard
to
educate
the
men
around
me
to
raise
their
consciousness
even
as
i
myself
be
in
the
early
stage
of
consciousness
raise
i
circulate
among
the
executive
at
the
company
an
article
that
appear
in
new
york
magazine
the
female
job
ghetto
i
write
a
note
to
our
personnel
director
after
i
have
receive
a
copy
of
a
memo
he
d
sent
around
introduce
some
new
people
at
the
post
point
out
what
i
view
as
a
subtle
example
of
bias
in
his
memo
this
head
of
personnel
have
refer
to
all
the
men
by
their
last
name
and
the
woman
by
their
first
name
here
be
an
example
of
the
need
for
more
sensitivity
i
write
uniformity
of
either
kind
be
ok
i
prefer
first
name
throughout
although
this
seem
superficial
attitude
which
it
reveals
be
not
no
doubt
it
could
have
be
write
by
mary
but
she
work
for
jones
at
the
company
i
often
receive
request
to
listen
to
woman
s
complaint
elsie
carper
told
me
of
repeatedly
receive
mediocre
assignment
meryl
secrest
from
style
come
to
tell
me
of
always
be
assign
woman
or
wife
to
interview
and
never
men
after
our
talk
i
write
her
that
i
d
always
be
there
to
listen
to
her
view
but
i
stood
by
the
editor
i
think
editor
have
to
decide
issue
such
as
how
and
where
to
use
reporter
i
fear
i
didn
t
lean
on
the
editor
to
change
their
way
when
newsweek
be
look
for
a
back
of
the
book
editor
i
suggest
the
able
art
critic
of
the
new
york
time
aline
saarinen
whom
the
editor
dismiss
out
of
hand
condescendingly
explain
that
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
to
have
a
woman
their
argument
be
that
the
closing
night
be
too
late
the
end
of
the
week
pressure
too
great
the
physical
demand
of
the
job
too
tough
i
be
embarrass
to
admit
that
i
simply
accepted
their
line
of
reason
passively
although
i
be
head
of
a
company
i
have
a
hard
time
make
change
happen
under
the
white
male
run
thing
i
think
i
make
some
small
inroad
however
ben
and
i
be
always
talk
about
the
language
use
in
the
paper
in
which
be
the
year
of
the
woman

be
one
of
five

the
first
time
to
the
washington

of

society
i
spoke
at
the
dinner
on
the
night
of
our
induction
and
talk
about
the
way
we
refer
to

newspaper
joking
that
the

indeed
only
the

before
ben
have
agree
to
several

of
concerned

and
have
sent

around
the

on
unconscious

into
news
article
he
caution
that
word
like

blonde

continued
word
like

have
long
since
become

and
be

on
that
count
alone
without
hamper
our
effort
to
get
good
description
into
the
paper
story
involve
the
achievement
of
woman
should
be
write
without
a
trace
of
condescension
feeling
about
woman
s
issue
have
slowly
gather
steam
and
by
the
early
s
they
explode
woman
in
professional
situation
begin
to
assert
themselves
through
lawsuit
in
behalf
of
equal
opportunity
in
march
of
forty
six
woman
at
newsweek
file
a
complaint
with
the
eeoc
claim
discrimination
not
coincidentally
it
be
the
same
day
that
newsweek
s
first
cover
story
on
the
woman
s
movement
title
woman
in
revolt
appear
i
m
sure
the
frustration
of
these
woman
be
fuel
by
the
fact
that
there
be
only
one
woman
writer
at
newsweek
at
the
time
and
she
be
judged
too
junior
for
the
assignment
so
a
freelancer
helen
dudar
the
wife
of
one
of
newsweek
s
writer
peter
goldman
be
hire
to
write
the
cover
i
be
away
at
the
time
and
get
a
phone
call
from
fritz
beebe
and
oz
elliott
together
tell
me
about
the
complaint
which
side
be
i
suppose
to
be
on
i
ask
to
which
fritz
quickly
respond
this
be
serious
it
isn
t
a
joke
i
hadn
t
thought
it
be
a
joke
nor
have
i
meant
my
question
to
be
we
then
go
on
to
discus
what
legal
response
to
take
since
the
woman
have
hire
eleanor
holmes
norton
to
represent
them
when
i
get
home
and
be
more
involve
in
the
action
i
think
i
become
too
embattle
as
someone
who
be
part
of
management
as
the
situation
grow
tenser
fuel
by
the
litigation
i
write
a
reader
defensively
i
agree
that
the
tradition
of
newsweeklies
have
tend
to
appear
to
discriminate
against
woman
we
be
make
plan
to
expand
opportunity
for
woman
and
be
continue
to
do
so
i
think
we
could
have
do
so
well
and
more
easily
have
the
group
at
newsweek
discuss
this
with
us
before
they
file
their
legal
complaint
of
course
i
can
see
in
hindsight
that
they
probably
have
discuss
the
issue
repeatedly
with
people
at
a
low
level
and
unbeknownst
to
me
eventually
we
start
to
remedy
the
situation
but
not
enough
by
august
we
reach
a
memorandum
of
understand
but
two
year
later
we
have
a
whole
new
round
when
the
editor
be
accuse
of
not
living
up
to
the
understand
this
time
we
be
more
successful
i
don
t
believe
it
be
bad
faith
that
make
us
fail
the
first
time
but
lack
of
understand
the
post
too
be
sue
in
after
earlier
complaint
have
go
largely
unnoticed
and
little
action
take
fifty
nine
woman
at
the
paper
clearly
dissatisfied
with
management
s
response
sign
a
letter
that
they
sent
me
ben
phil
geyelin
and
howard
simon
the
memo
let
the
company
s
own
statistic
speak
for
themselves
in
term
of
our
state
policy
at
the
post
to
make
the
equality
and
dignity
of
woman
completely
and
instinctively
meaningful
the
woman
note
that
the
post
have
actually
go
backwards
from
the
time
that
policy
statement
have
be
issue
two
year
previously
since
the
new
style
section
have
replace
the
old
woman
s
page
woman
have
lose
four
job
besides
me
meg
be
the
only
woman
in
upper
management
at
the
paper
at
one
point
during
all
this
ben
appoint
a
committee
in
the
newsroom
to
report
to
him
on
what
to
do
about
equal
employment
he
endorse
the
committee
s
report
recommend
the
creation
of
several
new
job
for
woman
and
for
black
who
be
experience
a
similar
yet
different
bias
i
respond
rather
stodgily
but
not
unreasonably
say
it
all
need
great
care
the
tendency
of
white
male
to
accept
other
white
male
come
in
the
transom
while
they
don
t
recruit
black
and
woman
be
a
tendency
that
isn
t
go
to
be
modify
by
the
sudden
compensation
of
additional
people
it
s
just
the
way
to
do
it
wrong
again
i
fear
because
it
take
time
and
effort
and
a
change
of
attitude
to
do
it
right
whatever
we
decide
to
do
i
felt
we
should
commit
an
equivalent
effort
to
the
business
side
of
the
paper
where
i
thought
even
more
remediation
be
need
than
in
the
city
room
we
wound
up
ask
elsie
carper
who
have
put
forth
the
idea
of
a
petition
instead
of
a
lawsuit
earlier
in
the
year
to
become
head
of
personnel
to
hire
more
woman
and
more
black
and
she
make
a
big
impact
on
the
paper
with
her
hire
like
all
business
and
editorial
company
in
fact
all
white
and
maledominated
institution
we
have
a
lot
to
learn
in
this
period
at
both
the
post
and
newsweek
there
be
a
great
deal
right
and
a
great
deal
wrong
about
some
of
our
procedure
and
some
of
our
response
to
the
issue
prior
to
the
late
s
our
intention
have
be
good
but
our
accomplishment
only
so
so
phil
have
encourage
black
recruiting
and
he
have
hire
a
black
reporter
but
no
system
of
goal
and
how
to
achieve
them
be
ever
put
in
place
when
the
s
brought
infusion
of
black
and
woman
neither
the
post
nor
newsweek
at
first
dealt
with
the
new
employee
with
much
sensitivity
understand
or
skill
but
this
be
also
true
of
almost
every
organization
in
mainstream
america
add
to
the
problem
be
that
our
begin
effort
to
hire
qualify
woman
and
minority
be
carry
out
inadequately
when
saddle
with
inadequate
talent
or
failure
whether
woman
or
black
we
didn
t
know
either
how
to
work
with
them
to
bring
them
along
or
how
to
let
them
go
eventually
thing
improve
dramatically
at
both
place
but
without
the
suit
and
without
the
law
adopt
by
the
country
this
would
have
happen
even
more
slowly
my
own
reaction
to
these
suit
be
mixed
i
felt
that
some
be
unfair
and
some
be
not
but
you
always
get
push
when
thing
become
confrontational
and
that
be
often
to
the
good
ironically
at
both
publication
we
be
do
well
vi
vi
woman
and
black
than
be
most
other
paper
and
magazine
where
there
weren
t
even
enough
woman
or
minority
to
confront
the
management
throughout
all
the
turmoil
over
woman
s
and
other
minority
issue
meg
be
my
value
adviser
in
the
middle
of
the
suit
and
eeoc
complaint
and
various
battle
she
write
me
a
stun
memo
speak
against
the
idea
of
quota
i
be
do
this
rather
pretentious
thing
of
send
you
a
memo
because
i
feel
so
strongly
that
it
will
be
a
mistake
and
that
it
will
not
be
a
small
mistake
everybody
agrees
that
we
must
do
far
more
than
we
have
to
bring
equity
and
opportunity
to
black
and
to
woman
at
the
post
and
that
we
will
be
not
just
a
fairer
employer
but
also
a
well
paper
for
do
so
nobody
so
far
as
i
know
include
those
who
be
hospitable
to
the
percentage
idea
be
particularly
enthusiastic
or
even
happy
about
adopt
a
so
call
quota
system
as
i
understand
it
one
principal
argument
in
favor
be
that
such
a
system
should
now
be
impose
because
it
be
evidently
the
only
way
in
which
we
can
make
ourselves
take
action
or
get
some
of
the
footdraggers
on
the
move
be
we
really
to
concede
that
we
cannot
make
ourselves
do
what
we
agree
be
both
desirable
and
fair
except
by
a
technique
that
strip
from
us
the
power
to
act
on
our
best
instinct
and
make
us
subject
to
automatic
imperative
that
rest
in
some
sort
of
contract
or
agreement
these
be
of
course
practical
concern
there
be
in
my
judgment
concern
of
principle
too
which
be
at
least
as
important
perhaps
more
so
for
we
be
move
almost
imperceptibly
from
a
concern
to
eradicate
and
compensate
for
the
effect
of
past
discrimination
through
an
awareness
that
we
cannot
be
entirely
color
blind
in
do
so
to
an
acquiescence
in
the
reestablishment
of
race
and
sex
as
legitimate
criterion
in
determine
the
way
we
treat
people
forgive
the
melodrama
meg
conclude
but
i
should
like
to
think
that
the
washington
post
will
be
know
as
one
of
those
rare
institution
that
perceive
the
enormous
cost
of
put
sex
and
race
back
into
law
that
resist
the
temptation
of
fashion
and
convenience
that
have
the
foresight
to
say
no
beyond
the
workplace
in
the
early
s
there
be
also
many
unenlightened
regressive
sanctuary
of
male
supremacy
among
them
in
washington
the
national
press

the
gridiron

annual

which
the

political
skit

slightly
princeton

and
other
well
know
people
as
well
as
newspaper
people
from
all
over
the
country
naturally
it
be
an
all
male
affair
here
actually
as
in
some
other
arena
it
be
easy
for
a
black
to
be
accepted
than
for

only
real
illness
could
make
me
miss
the
dinner
i
ll
have
to
be
too
ill
to
stand
if
i
don
t
go
my
first
reaction
be
that
after
all
these
year
of
be
on
the
outside
i
be
excite
to
be
invite
and
i
be
all
set
to
accept
when
i
receive
a
letter
sign
by
many
of
the
woman
on
the
editorial
side
of
the
paper
and
from
other
paper
ask
me
not
to
go
until
the
club
accepted
a
woman
as
a
member
but
there
be
no
opening
at
the
club
at
this
time
and
the
gesture
of
an
invitation
seem
to
me
a
begin
besides
which
i
really
want
to
go
however
i
ask
several
of
these
woman
to
dinner
at
my
house
to
discus
the
issue
among
those
who
come
be
meg
marilyn
berger
liz
peer
sarah
booth
conroy
and
elsie
carper
they
make
many
valid
argument
but
the
clincher
belong
to
sally
quinn
who
say
if
a
country
club
exclude
you
for
be
a
jew
but
say
they
d
like
to
have
you
for
dinner
would
you
go
that
cement
my
decision
to
regret
the
invitation
which
i
do
meg
and
i
be
planning
to
have
dinner
together
on
the
night
of
the
big
event
she
have
work
late
and
as
she
left
the
post
s
building
a
picket
line
be
already
form
across
the
street
at
the
statler
hotel
placard

i
m
a
member
of
the
no
iron
club
support
a
permanent
free
press
and
this
be
the
last
supper
meg
saw
that
judith
martin
now
miss
manner
be
already
walk
the
picket
line
push
a
baby
buggy
she
call
to
describe
the
scene
to
me
and
we
both
too
self
conscious
to
picket
decide
that
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
white
tie
attire
men
and
the
few
invite
lady
who
have
accepted
make
their
way
through
the
gauntlet
think
we
d
be
less
conspicuous
we
hopped
into
meg
s
beat
up
mustang
rather
than
my
more
identifiable
car
and
begin
our
cruise
try
to
be
as
casual
as
possible
circle
the
block
drive
past
the
hotel
to
see
what
we
be
miss
with
all
of
the
medium
coverage
we
be
worried
about
the
camera
catch
us
in
what
we
knew
would
be
a
dreadful
photo
and
could
already
imagine
the
caption
but
we
couldn
t
resist
so
meg
drove
and
i
hunch
down
as
best
i
could
try
to
avoid
be
see
while
meg
try
to
shield
the
whole
car
by
keep
us
partially
hidden
behind
a
bus
we
have
a
hilarious
perspective
on
this
scene
of
limousine
white
tie
and
tail
the
baby
buggy
and
the
picketers
after
many
circlings
and
several
sighting
we
go
back
to
my
house
and
have
dinner
and
a
great
laugh
satisfied
to
have
have
it
both
way
it
be
not
until
that
the
gridiron
change
its
policy
and
admit
woman
that
be
the
first
year
i
attend
the
federal
city
council
be
another
case
in
point
ironically
it
have
be
create
in
large
part
by
phil
and
many
post
executive
have
be
or
be
member
i
be
only
vaguely
aware
of
my
not
be
include
until
one
day
when
i
be
invite
to
go
along
with
council
member
on
a
tour
of
the
district
s
subway
system
then
be
construct
as
i
look
around
our
group
it
dawn
on
me
that
not
only
be
there
no
other
woman
present
but
there
be
none
on
the
council
i
be
absolutely
sure
that
there
have
be
woman
on
it
when
phil
found
it
because
i
remember
at
least
one
i
ask
what
have
happen
and
only
then
realize
that
no
one
have
ever
ask
me
to
join
i
remember
be
more
indignant
than
embarrass
a
more
helpful
reaction
for
further
the
goal
of
the
woman
s
movement
and
insist
that
someone
make
sure
the
head
of
the
council
knew
that
either
they
must
get
some
woman
in
the
organization
or
the
post
be
go
to
write
about
it
very
soon
after
our
tour
i
be
invite
to
join
together
with
a
few
other
woman
far
proof
that
much
of
what
i
be
hearing
from
woman
everywhere
be
seep
into
me
and
affect
my
think
be
a
letter
i
draft
to
paul
miller
then
chairman
of
the
gannett
company
and
later
head
of
the
associate
press
for
many
year
i
raise
a
problem
i
felt
be
serious
enough
to
bring
up
at
the
next
membership
meeting
of
the
ap
the
composition
of
the
board
which
be
not
only
all
male
and
all
white
but
also
business
rather
than
editorial
orient
i
say
i
would
be
personally
reluctant
to
continue
to
participate
in
meeting
or
social
occasion
that
perpetuate
such
a
state
of
affair
obviously
i
felt
strongly
but
in
the
end
my
native
caution
take
over
and
the
letter
be
never
sent
i
regret
now
that
it
wasn
t
much
later
i
myself
get
elect
to
the
board
the
first
woman
and
serve
three
term
everything
include
the
staff
that
come
to
meeting
be
still
the
same
male
and
white
although
i
repeatedly
brought
up
the
subject
when
i
be
on
the
board
it
be
generally
treat
as
a
cute
joke
despite
the
association
s
have
be
sue
by
its
woman
member
a
suit
which
i
in
vain
told
them
they
ought
to
settle
it
take
many
more
year
for
the
situation
to
begin
to
change
i
always
thought
thing
would
grow
well
with
time
that
the
atmosphere
would
become
more
welcome
of
woman
particularly
when
there
be
more
woman
involve
and
less
notice
be
give
to
any
single
one
of
us
but
it
didn
t
happen
that
way
for
one
thing
there
never
be
that
many
more
of
us
and
still
aren
t
at
least
not
at
the
high
level
the
issue
relate
to
woman
be
on
my
mind
constantly
throughout
these
year
though
it
take
me
a
long
time
to
throw
off
some
of
my
early
and
ingrain
assumption
i
do
come
to
understand
the
importance
of
the
basic
problem
of
equality
in
the
workplace
upward
mobility
salary
equity
and
more
recently
child
care
what
the
woman
s
movement
eventually
do
for
me
personally
be
to
help
me
sort
out
my
think
most
important
to
me
be
not
the
central
message
of
the
movement
that
woman
be
equal
but
that
woman
have
a
right
to
choose
which
life
style
suit
them
we
all
have
a
right
to
a
frame
of
reference
other
than
that
we
be
put
on
earth
to
catch
a
man
hold
him
and
please
him
eventually
i
come
to
realize
that
if
woman
understood
this
and
act
on
it
thing
would
be
well
for
men
as
well
as
for
woman
ironically
it
be
during
these
particular
year
of
the
late
s
and
early
s
while
i
be
anguish
over
so
many
personal
and
professional
matter
that
my
own
profile
be
begin
to
rise
to
my
surprise
i
be
suddenly
write
about
essentially
it
have
start
with
the
piece
in
vogue
by
arthur
schlesinger
later
that
same
year
i
be
on
the
cover
of
business
week
and
still
later
in
the
year
appear
on
the
cover
of
the
washingtonian
profile
flatteringly
by
judith
viorst
this
be
a
completely
novel
and
strange
experience
even
my
mother
be
impressed
and
ask
for
a
dozen
copy
i
be
unused
to
be
interviewed
and
very
self
conscious
about
these
article
in
fact
i
usually
refuse
request
for
interview
cooperate
only
if
i
thought
it
would
help
the
company
i
steadfastly
refuse
to
do
television
interview
on
the
ground
of
protect
my
privacy
i
didn
t
want
that
kind
of
visibility
but
i
also
felt
awkward
and
nervous
about
do
it
and
wouldn
t
have
be
good
at
it
if
i
have
try
yet
despite
my
apprehension
it
be
pleasant
have
these
article
be
so
positive
and
indeed
i
be
do
some
thing
right
for
instance
i
form
the
habit
early
and
have
kept
it
up
to
the
present
of
answer
letter
from
reader
whether
of
praise
or
criticism
people
need
to
feel
that
they
can
react
against
what
be
publish
or
air
and
that
someone
be
listen
to
their
suggestion
or
complaint
because
of
my
scrupulous
impulse
to
respond
to
explain
even
to
soothe
there
be
a
paper
trail
of
correspondence
from
these
year
which
reflect
the
grow
pressure
and
tension
of
the
time
mostly
my
top
priority
be
to
back
the
editor
and
reporter
and
defend
them
from
assault
especially
if
the
complaint
come
from
somewhere
in
the
government
while
at
the
same
time
try
to
protect
the
company
from
undue
heat
sometimes
it
be
as
difficult
to
deal
with
a
reporter
or
an
editor
as
with
an
outsider
editor
tend
to
develop
what
ben
call
a
defensive
crouch
a
natural
reaction
that
have
its
virtue
because
it
s
often
assume
in
support
of
reporter
they
get
so
many
unwarranted
complaint
that
they
become
harden
until
they
will
sometimes
react
defensively
against
even
the
most
persuasive
argument
as
a
result
they
need
to
be
very
certain
that
they
re
not
rigid
but
be
listen
carefully
for
those
comment
and
complaint
that
be
on
target
and
respond
to
them
constructively
not
surprisingly
all
of
us
publisher
and
editor
react
as
violently
as
the
public
do
when
it
s
our
ox
that
s
gore
i
know
that
reporter
who
have
never
be
write
about
be
not
sensitive
enough
to
the
feeling
of
the
people
about
whom
they
re
write
often
i
wish
that
those
writer
who
seem
to
delight
in
savage
their
target
could
experience
it
themselves
sometime
have
endure
my
fair
share
of
savagery
i
try
harder
to
monitor
our
fairness
and
to
be
sympathetic
to
rational
complaint
from
reader
at
time
i
ve
have
to
defend
thing
i
didn
t
like
or
think
be
fair
or
in
good
taste
for
instance
my
life
would
have
be
a
lot
simpler
have
nicholas
von
hoffman
not
appear
in
the
paper
i
remember
one
column
in
which
he
say
in
effect
that
all
use
car
dealer
be
crook
this
piece
result
in
a
very
expensive
advertising
boycott
of
the
paper
and
lose
us
a
large
amount
of
money
i
recall
throw
up
my
hand
at
one
point
and
write
a
reader
that
i
agree
that
a
particular
column
of
nick
s
shouldn
t
have
gotten
into
the
paper
nick
do
have
extreme
view
some
of
which
be
distasteful
to
me
as
well
as
to
some
of
our
reader
but
he
also
have
a
gift
voice
and
represent
a
certain
segment
of
the
population
that
need
to
be
heard
almost
alone
among
american
journalist
at
the
time
von
hoffman
be
tell
us
what
be
in
the
mind
of
the
young
who
felt
dispossess
and
unrepresented
by
the
so
call
establishment
press
i
firmly
believe
that
he
belong
in
the
post
i
also
take
a
lot
of
heat
over
the
year
because
of
herblock
s
cartoon
they
inspire
a
great
deal
of
mail
and
i
be
constantly
defend
him
herb
have
be
one
of
the
great
and
most
relentless
asset
of
the
post
for
half
a
century
his
cartoon
be
so
powerful
that
they
ve
sometimes
make
me
gasp
his
strong
feeling
come
through
in
every
draw
i
would
try
to
reassure
furious
reader
by
remind
them
the
nature
of
cartoon
be
to
exaggerate
to
make
a
point
i
also
often
remind
reader
that
a
great
cartoonist
be
an
artist
with
all
the
temperament
that
that
implies
herblock
be
undeniably
a
great
cartoonist
and
as
i
write
to
one
reader
it
seem
to
us
that
he
have
therefore
earn
a
certain
license
he
could
not
continue
to
be
as
good
as
he
be
if
he
be
subject
to
censorship
or
control
by
those
who
do
not
share
his
particular
genius
by
somebody
constantly
tell
him
to
be
more
careful
to
pull
his
punch
to
do
it
some
other
way
to
another
reader
i
sum
up
the
situation
by
say
you
either
live
with
him
or
without
him
the
latter
of
which
be
unthinkable
to
me
the
war
in
vietnam
and
the
post
s
and
newsweek
s
position
on
the
war
also
cause
a
great
deal
of
dismay
on
the
part
of
reader
naturally
from
both
end
of
the
political
spectrum
mostly
i
try
to
explain
our
stance
and
to
remind
reader
that
we
didn
t
dictate
government
policy
or
unduly
influence
anyone
on
april
by
which
time
the
paper
have
turn
away
from
its
largely
supportive
position
on
the
war
and
after
lbj
have
announce
that
he
would
not
be
a
candidate
for
reelection
i
write
a
post
reader
we
simply
believe
the
policy
of
automatic
escalation
have
be
try
and
have
fail
we
suggest
rethink
our
policy
in
viet
nam
i
can
only
deduce
that
the
president
too
have
come
to
this
conclusion
neither
of
us
i
be
sure
do
this
under
any
subversive
influence
in
the
post
only
the
second
paper
to
do
so
start
employ
an
ombudsman
whose
job
it
be
to
receive
and
review
complaint
about
what
appear
in
the
paper
even
correction
can
be
troublesome
particularly
when
attempt
to
rectify
some
egregious
error
only
compound
the
original
problem
in
a
sense
we
in
the
medium
be
all
ombudsman
try
to
lessen
the
feel
some
people
have
that
they
be
helpless
and
without
hope
of
a
hearing
most
of
all
what
i
know
i
do
well
in
these
year
be
to
care
about
the
company
i
take
an
inordinate
interest
in
all
that
we
do
an
interest
that
be
once
described
accurately
if
in
a
sexist
way
as
compound
of
equal
part
of
house
mother
and
cheerleader
i
try
to
create
an
atmosphere
that
give
people
the
freedom
to
do
their
job
an
environment
in
which
good
idea
would
always
be
heard
i
think
i
share
the
high
and
the
low
the
failure
as
well
as
the
success
and
success
there
certainly
be
we
be
barreling
forward
on
the
news
side
and
enjoy
some
success
editorially
in
both
publication
and
at
the
station
there
be
nothing
as
good
for
morale
as
a
few
victory
and
the
feel
of
progress
that
come
from
innovative
idea
ours
be
still
modest
progress
but
it
be
visible
chapter
twenty
two
coincide
with
change
in
the
company
come
far
change
in
the
country
not
the
least
of
which
be
richard
nixon
s
inauguration
in
and
the
begin
of
his
administration
nixon
have
a
long
stand
problem
with
the
press
as
a
whole
and
the
post
in
particular
twice
he
have
angrily
cancel
his
subscription
to
the
paper
but
at
least
at
the
begin
of
his
administration
thing
be
civil
if
not
friendly
between
us
basically
i
be
reserve
judgment
after
he
have
be
in
office
only
two
week
i
write
ken
galbraith
the
nixon
group
be
still
a
puzzle
as
no
one
know
what
he
or
they
be
for
apparently
nothing
they
be
discuss
pre
election
but
that
s
par
isn
t
it
in
march
president
nixon
call
me
to
suggest
that
i
invite
henry
kissinger
to
an
editorial
lunch
to
brief
us
on
administration
think
on
vietnam
the
very
next
week
kissinger
come
to
lunch
a
meeting
that
be
the
start
of
a
long
relationship
with
the
paper
and
with
me
all
of
the
top
editor
and
reporter
from
the
post
be
there
as
well
as
a
few
from
newsweek
s
washington
bureau
we
all
note
with
interest
that
nixon
sent
kissinger
not
bill
rogers
his
secretary
of
state
bill
s
have
be
a
significant
departure
for
me
and
for
the
company
since
he
have
be
a
friend
as
well
as
our
legal
adviser
we
inherit
a
mess
henry
say
in
answer
a
question
about
whether
the
new
administration
didn
t
appear
to
be
almost
as
hawkish
as
johnson
s
he
emphasize
that
lbj
have
sent
half
a
million
men
to
vietnam
with
no
overall
policy
though
vietnam
be
the
primary
focus
of
the
lunch
we
also
talk
about
arm
control
and
nuclear
proliferation
it
be
clear
that
henry
be
brilliant
and
at
lunch
that
day
he
be
both
funny
and
articulate
my
relationship
with
nixon
be
very
different
i
go
to
the
nixon
white
house
twice
in
once
for
the
farewell
dinner
for
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
have
resign
from
the
supreme
court
and
the
second
time
for
a
dinner
for
the
associate

director
at
which
local
publisher

incredibly
i
receive
a
letter
from

of

of
four

doubt
staff
write
read
this
be
a
just
tribute
to
your
outstanding
career
and
example
there
be
few
woman
in
our
nation
held
in
such
high
opinion
by
their
peer
we
be
glad
to
count
ourselves
among
your
admirer
this
admire
attitude
didn
t
last
long
whatever
lyndon
johnson
s
feeling
have
be
about
the
press
in
general
or
me
in
particular
i
begin
to
realize
how
much
i
miss
him
the
atmosphere
between
the
nixon
administration
and
the
medium
quickly
become
embattle
that
very
fall
the
war
on
the
eastern
establishment
elitist
press
begin
in
earnest
and
the
post
be
drag
into
the
middle
of
it
in
mid
november
nixon
make
a
tough
speech
on
vietnam
imply
that
most
of
the
american
people
support
him
in
what
he
be
do
and
that
only
the
press
be
critical
a
reaction
to
nixon
come
in
the
form
of
the
big
antiwar
rally
ever
held
in
washington
when
ask
for
his
response
to
it
nixon
say
he
have
be
watch
football
a
reaction
that
the
post
compare
to
marie
antoinette
s
let
them
eat
cake
the
follow
week
vice
president
agnew
select
the
post
for
particular
attention
say
in
a
speech
that
we
be
an
example
of
a
trend
toward
monopolization
he
be
not
recommend
the
dismemberment
of
the
washington
post
company
he
emphasize
but
merely
point
out
that
the
public
should
be
aware
that
these
four
powerful
voice
he
count
our
all
news
radio
station
along
with
the
post
newsweek
and
our
television
station
harken
to
the
same
master
when
i
first
heard
his
allegation
that
all
the
branch
of
the
company
answer
to
one
voice
mine
i
be
flabbergast
at
such
a
lack
of
understand
my
defend
the
washington
post
company
in
these
year
and
what
we
be
do
or
say
or
publishing
be
instinctive
since
i
believe
so
much
in
our
mission
it
wasn
t
hard
to
do
my
response
to
this
diatribe
of
agnew
s
be
to
insist
that
the
various
division
of
our
company
decidedly
do
not
grind
out
the
same
editorial
line
on
the
contrary
each
branch
operate
autonomously
and
they
all
compete
vigorously
with
one
another
even
disagree
on
many
issue
in
addition
i
point
out
that
by
any
objective
standard
the
post
and
wtop
be
operating
in
one
of
the
most
competitive
communication
city
in
america
agnew
s
word
have
land
on
fertile
ground
in
an
emotional
environment
it
wasn
t
just
vietnam
and
civil
right
that
be
tear
the
country
apart
and
preoccupy
us
there
be
a
social
revolution
go
on
there
be
no
doubt
that
he
worried
all
of
us
perhaps
more
than
he
should
have
by
strike
a
popular
chord
in
a
vulnerable
area
once
he
get
a
positive
response
he
kept
up
his
harangue
pour
on
the
heat
egg
on
we
increasingly
felt
by
nixon
himself
toward
the
end
of
november
phil
geyelin
be
at
a
dinner
with
herb
klein
press
officer
at
the
white
house
and
sent
me
a
memo
afterwards
about
their
conversation
during
which
phil
have
ask
klein
if
what
we
be
face
be
a
concert
campaign
from
the
white
house
and
to
what
extent
the
president
exercise
control
over
it
klein
s
reply
the
president
tell
them
which
way
to
go
but
he
can
t
read
speech
in
advance
if
there
be
another
speech
by
agnew
phil
ask
klein
could
it
be
laid
at
nixon
s
doorstep
he
also
ask
if
klein
concede
that
we
might
have
reason
to
wonder
what
such
an
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
administration
meant
for
the
renewal
of
our
television
and
radio
license
klein
felt
that
agnew
s
speech
guaranteed
we
d
get
our
license
since
so
many
people
would
be
watch
this
be
all
of
course
before
watergate
and
a
real
foreshadow
of
thing
to
come
soon
after
this
exchange
on
december
newsweek
s
washington
bureau
chief
mel
elfin
invite
agnew
to
dinner
at
his
house
along
with
certain
reporter
from
the
bureau
editor
from
new
york
and
me
the
main
discussion
of
the
night
center
on
why
agnew
have
take
after
the
press
and
alternately
why
the
press
be
so
much
after
agnew
mel
and
bob
shogan
write
up
a
long
memo
of
what
take
place
that
night
what
we
all
have
for
dinner
they
write
be
pure
essence
of
agnew
it
be
a
typical
predictable
performance
it
may
or
may
not
be
reassure
to
know
that
the
man
doesn
t
sound
or
act
differently
in
a
semi
private
semi
social
situation
than
he
do
in
public
what
make
it
seem
so
abrasive
and
a
little
unreal
at
time
be
that
we
have
an
unusually
intensive
dose
one
of
the
first
thing
agnew
say
that
night
be
the
real
trouble
with
this
administration
be
that
it
have
bad
pr
when
ask
if
he
clear
his
own
speech
with
the
president
he
respond
except
for
foreign
policy
matter
of
substance
i
don
t
clear
anything
with
anybody
reporter
respond
nearly
in
chorus
to
the
effect
that
if
he
expect
us
to
believe
that
why
couldn
t
he
believe
that
newsweek
the
washington
post
and
our
station
didn
t
clear
everything
with
kay
graham
it
be
the
only
point
all
even
mel
note
on
which
the
vice
president
seem
to
give
a
little
ground
albeit
somewhat
grudgingly
admit
that
maybe
he
hadn
t
fully
understood
how
the
washington
post
co
ran
but
as
mel
write
all
that
have
be
say
throughout
the
even
seem
only
to
have
be
preparation
for
the
veep
s
big
curtain
speech
agnew
must
have
be
rehearse
it
in
his
mind
as
the
rest
of
us
chatter
away
while
he
glance
continually
at
his
watch
suddenly
there
be
silence
and
spiro
spoke
out
of
the
past
caligula
s
horse
come
gallop
again
provide
a
cognomen
and
a
symbol
for
the
even
something
like
citizen
kane
s
rosebud
i
want
you
to
know
how
i
feel
about
thing
the
veep
say
in
his
most
candid
manner
to
refer
to
me
as
caligula
s
horse
be
intellectual
dishonesty
then
beam
like
a
man
who
have
struck
precisely
the
right
blow
he
prance
out
of
the
room
and
into
the
night
despite
these
unsettle
strain
there
be
still
a
good
deal
of
traffic
between
the
administration
and
people
throughout
the
post
company
i
be
try
to
keep
open
the
channel
of
communication
and
for
the
most
part
during
the
first
year
of
the
nixon
administration
everything
remain
polite
and
professional
we
have
several
administration
people
in
to
editorial
lunch
include
attorney
general
john
mitchell
just
after
he
have
come
the
post
get
into
a
flap
with
him
because
ken
clawson
a
reporter
who
later
join
the
administration
misquote
him
in
a
story
we
ran
a
correction
in
the
same
place
where
the
mistake
have
be
make
on
the
front
page
and
the
attorney
general
write
me
a
pleased
letter
say
now
you
can
see
why
i
say
the
post
be
the
best
paper
in
the
country
i
should
have
frame
the
letter
i
also
have
professional
dealing
and
even
some
social
relation
with
john
ehrlichman
as
head
of
a
committee
try
to
deal
with
crime
in
the
district
i
have
first
met
ehrlichman
when
i
go
to
him
to
seek
aid
for
funding
more
police
at
which
time
i
found
him
helpful
and
even
fun
at
one
point
early
in
in
a
regular
daily
column
that
appear
in
the
post
call
activity
in
congress
we
have
through
a
typographical
error
mistakenly
identify
ehrlichman
as
a
white
mouse
aide
he
have
clipped
the
piece
and
sent
it
to
me
with
a
note
say
for
a
while
now
i
have
suspect
that
the
post
thought
the
president
be
a
rat
now
it
appear
that
you
have
turn
your
calumny
on
the
rest
of
us
oh
opprobrium
perhaps
there
will
be
a
place
at
disneyland
for
me
when
all
of
this
be
a
memory
i
respond
in
kind
say
i
understood
we
have
not
only
term
him
a
mouse
aide
but
a
white
mouse
aide
thus
introduce
a
note
of
racial
prejudice
and
ask
if
he
intend
to
launch
a
full
scale
fairness
investigation
as
time
go
on
i
saw
much
more
of
henry
kissinger
he
be
still
single
and
occasionally
ask
me
out
to
do
something
casual
at
night
much
later
when
he
married
nancy
maginnes
i
worried
that
he
would
go
out
of
my
life
i
didn
t
know
nancy
and
wasn
t
sure
how
we
d
get
along
gradually
however
we
three
form
a
close
friendship
that
flourish
to
this
day
people
have
often
ask
how
i
handle
friend
like
henry
insofar
as
the
paper
be
concerned
it
varied
with
different
people
but
certainly
no
one
at
the
post
or
newsweek
go
any
easy
on
henry
because
we
be
friend
in
fact
our
friendship
may
have
make
thing
a
little
harder
for
him
nixon
remain
puzzle
to
me
early
in
i
have
write
to
lyndon
johnson
say
i
often
think
of
you
i
must
say
washington
be
a
very
different
place
this
be
the
strangest
group
i
can
ever
remember
i
hadn
t
communicate
much
with
lbj
since
he
and
lady
bird
have
left
washington
in
january
but
whatever
have
come
between
us
over
the
year
seem
to
fall
away
and
he
write
me
back
how
glad
he
be
to
hear
from
me
when
he
sent
a
large
bouquet
of
flower
around
easter
i
felt
that
the
time
of
frost
be
over
i
call
him
immediately
and
ask
whether
he
might
be
come
to
washington
soon
and
if
so
whether
i
could
do
something
for
him
dinner
at
my
house
or
an
editorial
lunch
at
the
post
soon
the
answer
come
back
that
he
d
like
to
do
both
and
the
date
be
set
in
april
the
johnson

to
r

of

living
room
before

length
about
their
father

to
them
from

and
memo
phil
have
write
him
which
he
d
brought
along
and
tell
them
how
much
phil
have
meant
to
him
it
be
johnson
at
his
best
and
most
thoughtful
but
nice
as
the
even
be
it
didn
t
hold
a
candle
to
lunch
the
next
day
when
the
top
editor
and
reporter
of
the
post
and
newsweek
gather
at
the
paper
the
conversation
go
on
for
more
than
four
hour
two
post
reporter
dick
harwood
and
haynes
johnson
later
write
about
it
movingly
and
in
great
detail
in
their
book
lyndon
they
note
how
johnson
have
have
one
of
a
series
of
heart

only
a
month
before
this
washington
visit
his
hair
have
turn
almost
completely
white
and
have
grown
long
because
he
explain
the
ranch
be
so
far
from
a
barbershop
that
he
cut
it
himself
though
he
didn
t
look
very
well
any
sign
of
illness
seem
to
fade
as
he
begin
to
talk
about
the
problem
of
the
presidency
gradually
his
manner
and
mood
change
harwood
and
johnson
write
he
begin
talk
about
vietnam
and
suddenly
he
be
more
vigorous
and
assertive
because
he
be
write
his
memoir
foremost
in
his
mind
be
his
own
place
in
history
he
be
very
concerned
with
how
he
and
his
administration
would
be
view
and
have
actually
plan
for
this
luncheon
meeting

president
of
cnn
then
still
lyndon
s
administrative
assistant

of
the
most
sensitive
file
so
that

review
with
us
how
he
have
make
certain

tom
have
brought
two
briefcase
full
of
top
secret
document
about

in
vietnam
and
he
later
recall
there
be
no
other
occasion
like
that
that
i
experienced
either
inside
the
white
house
during
his
white
house
year
or
in
his
retirement
year
as
he
talk
lyndon
would
reach
behind
him
to
tom
who
knew
just
what
paper
he
want
and
put
it
into
lbj
s
extend
hand
lyndon
be
just
like
the
relay
runner
who
reach
behind
him
for
the
baton
without
look
back
and
while
still
run
meg
who
be

somewhere
between
lbj
and
tom
have
to
keep
bobbing
back
and
forth
to
accommodate
lyndon
s
outstretched
hand
as
tom
saw
it
lbj
use
the
lunch
as
a
venue
for
vent

of
his
feeling
and
frustration
about
thing
that
have
work
against
his

all
he
have
try
to
accomplish
while
in

with
a
detailed
chronology
of
why
he
have
call
for
the
bombing

in
and
how
he
come
to
the
decision
not
to

again
in

spell
out
the
background
of
each
decision
in
detail
almost
minute
by
minute
complete
with
typical
johnson
language
he
talk
about
his
own
love
hate
relationship
with
the
press
and
say
he
agree
with
many
of
agnew
s
criticism
of
the
press
s
liberalism
he
reminisce
about
his
childhood
and
his
entire
political
career
as
he
get
go
particularly
on
his
own
background
he
become
as
haynes
and
harwood
say
more
colloquial
and
more
texan

be
overpower
they
recall
a
feel
i
have
too

with
his
arm
slump
back
into
his
seat
switch
from
a
sharp
to
a
soft
story
and
kept
the
conversation
go
from
the
moment
he
sat
down
at
the
table
until
hour
later
when
lady

and
philosophical

a
daddy
to
me
and
phil

me
and
rail
at
me
and
tell

that
way
of
his

the
room
not
all
of
them
johnson
fan
by
any
mean
burst
spontaneously
into
applause
something
i
have
never
see
before
and
have
not
witness
since
it
be
a
highly
emotional
farewell
while
my
public
life
grow
busier
and
busier
my
private
life
grow
even
more
so
nevertheless
there
be
many
small
and
large
pleasure
in
these
year
quiet
time
that
i
remember
still
to
some
extent
family
problem
increase
as
my
mother
age
throughout
the
mid
s
she
go
rapidly
downhill
physically
too
many
year
of
too
much
food
and
drink
combine
with
too
little
exercise
have
make
her
overweight
as
well
as
arthritic
when
a
psychiatrist
finally
succeed
in
get
her
to
reduce
her
drinking
it
be
too
late
for
her
to
retrieve
her
mobility
but
not
too
late
to
recover
her
control
of
her
interest
and
pursuit
she
be
back
again
exercise
her
authority
criticize
and
argue
it
be
quite
a
comeback
and
she
be
in
very
good
form
for
the
last
few
year
of
her
life
which
she
live
to
the
full
with
all
her
mental
faculty
intact
right
to
the
end
i
have
go
to
mount
kisco
to
visit
her
for
the
labor
day
weekend
in
and
be
awaken
on
september
by
her
maid
who
told
me
she
be
worried
because
my
mother
have
not
rung
for
her
breakfast
i
sense
that
she
knew
something
be
wrong
so
i
jumped
up
and
ran
in
to
find
mother
in
her
bed
weirdly
inert
and
already
cold
though
i
have
be
expect
her
death
for
some
time
it
be
still
a
profoundly
move
shock
when
it
become
a
reality
my
mother
be
no
longer
there
to
love
to
resent
to
emulate
to
rebel
against
it
have
always
mystify
me
that
i
be
a
weeper
on
other
occasion
but
not
at
death
it
seem
almost
inhuman
to
cry
at
superficial
book
and
movie
or
when
upset
or
angry
but
not
when
i
m
deeply
shaken
as
i
certainly
be
not
only
at
my
mother
s
death
but
at
phil
s
and
my
father
s
as
well
as
my
sister
s
and
later
at
my
brother
s
and
since
then
at
too
many
close
friend
i
think
that
part
of
my
reaction
to
my
mother
s
death
be
that
i
couldn
t
believe
she
be
go
she
have
lead
a
long
and
extraordinary
life
and
left
her
distinctive
mark
in
many
area
certainly
on
her
child
and
grandchild
and
even
on
the
two
old
great
grandchild
i
admire
and
be
impressed
by
her
increasingly
with
the
passage
of
time
my
brother
have
finally
broken
up
his
long
term
marriage
be
another
worry
for
me
in
these
year
he
seem
always
to
be
ill
and
have
innumerable
back
and
neck
operation
and
have
start
take
pain
kill
drug
as
well
as
drinking
more
heavily
his
loneliness
be
terrible
later
he
too
recover
and
lead
a
good
life
for
many
year
my
son
steve
be
still
another
concern
he
be
lonely
at
home
since
bill
four
year
his
senior
have
left
for
college
steve
be
a
classic
member
of
his
generation
his
class
at
st
albans
be
the
first
really
to
confront
drug
in
school
and
few
of
us
parent
knew
how
to
cope
with
the
social
revolution
that
we
saw
reflect
in
our
own
home
unfortunately
since
our
house
be
the
big
and
the
least
supervise
it
become
the
place
where
steve
and
his
friend
gather
and
his
room
become
the
local
pot
parlor
i
would
return
home
to
find
the
window
all
open
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
fume
out
and
cover
up
the
telltale
sign
of
smoking
i
beg
him
to
stop
threaten
that
if
caught
he
and
his
friend
would
find
themselves
right
on
the
front
page
of
the
post
it
have
little
effect
my
social
life
be
escalate
some
of
it
have
to
do
with
new
friend
i
be
make
within
the
industry
some
with
maintain
a
life
in
two
city
washington
and
new
york
much
of
it
be
work
related
but
part
i
do
from
sheer
enjoyment
there
remain
an
element
within
me
of
disbelief
that
i
would
be
include
by
people
i
thought
remote
and
glamorous
i
wasn
t
pursue
either
famous
or
wealthy
people
but
my
son
bill
later
told
me
that
he
remember
think
on
occasion
that
there
be
too
many
famous
people
around
the
house
i
suppose
that
i
fell
somewhere
between
the
way
i
have
grown
up
and
the
way
my
child
now
live
high
fashion
be
certainly
new
to
me
betsey
whitney
and
babe
paley
have
suggest
that
i
try
halston
as
a
dressmaker
he
have
set
up
his
own
design
establishment
after
leave
the
hat
department
at
bergdorf
goodman
i
do
try
him
and
our
relationship
be
a
great
success
for
fourteen
year
until
he
go
out
of
business
he
make
my
clothes
i
felt
i
look
well
than
i
ever
have
rudi
serkin
be
one
of
my
good
friend
at
this
time
for
a
weekend
each
summer
i
go
to
marlboro
the
music
festival
and
school
that
my
parent
have
help
him
start
i
remember
watch
casals
conduct
a
schumann
symphony
the
most
excite
thing
i
d
ever
heard
and
we
attend
rehearsal
much
the
best
part
of
visit
marlboro
more
important
to
me
even
in
our
short
time
together
each
summer
rudi
and
i
developed
a
real
friendship
which
grow
over
the
year
i
love
his
story
of
his
youth
his
teacher
grow
up
in
the
adolph
busch
household
and
fall
in
love
with
adolph
s
daughter
irena
when
he
be
only
fifteen
and
she
be
four
my
one
weekend
every
summer
at
marlboro
be
never
enough
for
rudi
he
always
lament
the
lack
of
music
in
my
life
shake
his
head
sadly
about
the
few
concert
i
attend
or
record
i
played
and
say
how
can
you
live
a
life
without
music
i
felt
i
make
up
in
part
for
this
deficiency
by
soak
it
up
so
intensely
while
i
be
there
i
also
saw
something
of
jean
monnet
in
these
year
he
have
remain
a
friend
from
the
time
phil
and
i
have
first
met
him
in
the
early
s
the
thrill
for
me
of
be
with
him
never
disappear
as
long
as
he
live
he
be
energetic
and
interest
and
i
can
testify
to
his
virility
i
especially
love
the
way
he
use
the
english
language
and
his
insightful
comment
on
the
american
political
scene
i
recall
his
once
tell
me
after
he
have
lunch
with
bobby
kennedy
that
he
have
be
very
impressed
say
the
president
have
authority
bobby
have
strength
i
also
developed
a
friendship
with
clay
felker
we
fell
into
instant
conversational
rapport
i
have
never
met
anyone
like
him
and
i
appreciate
his
idea
his
obsession
with
edit
and
even
his
preoccupation
with
new
york
city
and
with
new
york
magazine
which
he
have
successfully
launch
i
never
get
use
to
clay
s
odd
estrangement
from
the
human
race
but
i
grow
to
be
and
remain
very
fond
of
him
he
change
my
new
york
life
from
one
of
solemn
dinner
party
to
one
of
great
fun
take
me
to
ethnic
restaurant
or
to
the
theater
he
often
come
to
washington
and
we
go
to
glen
welby
for
occasional
weekend
on
one
of
these
i
brought
him
together
with
rupert
murdoch
feel
sure
that
they
would
become
friend
which
they
do
but
it
turn
out
to
be
an
unfortunate
friendship
for
clay
since
he
talk
to
rupert
freely
over
that
weekend
even
about
his
have
badly
alienate
his
own
director
on
the
magazine
rupert
end
up
take
over
clay
s
company
in
the
spring
of
fritz
beebe
come
to
me
with
a
critical
decision
to
be
make
he
thought
our
situation
be
such
that
we
have
to
take
the
company
public
as
some
other
big
company
time
mirror
and
knight
ridder
for
instance
have
already
do
if
we
didn
t
he
felt
we
have
to
sell
one
of
our
asset
something
big
like
our
television
station
in
jacksonville
accord
to
fritz
we
be
strap
for
cash
phil
have
hand
out
stock
option
fairly
freely
and
since
we
be
a
private
company
we
be
require
to
buy
the
stock
back
at
a
valuation
determine
by
price
waterhouse
by
this
time
the
price
of
the
stock
have
risen
far
more
than
have
be
foreseen
and
we
be
have
to
spend
cash
for
these
option
as
people
left
or
retire
i
wish
i
have
understood
the
whole
thing
well
than
i
do
my
learn
path
be
more
in
editorial
and
management
and
i
still
knew
little
about
business
and
simply
take
fritz
s
word
for
the
problem
and
assume
we
have
only
two
choice
either
go
public
or
sell
wjxt
i
wasn
t
sure
what
be
a
public
company
entail
but
i
knew
there
would
be
obligation
and
discipline
that
be
not
impose
on
private
company
i
also
knew
that
we
would
have
to
be
open
with
information
to
shareholder
yet
think
that
it
might
be
good
for
us
to
have
to
run
our
business
in
a
more
discipline
and
profitable
way
i
decide
that
we
ought
to
go
public
all
my
instinct
say
we
should
go
forward
not
back
what
i
didn
t
understand
since
the
day
of
the
takeover
have
not
yet
dawn
be
that
there
be
a
risk
we
might
be
take
over
by
any
of
these
large
company
that
have
sent
out
feeler
and
have
remain
in
a
friendly
court
kind
of
stance
thank
heaven
fritz
and
his
cravath
partner
george
gillespie
do
understand
this
they
create
a
situation
in
which
we
go
public
with
two
class
of
share
the
a
share
about
one
million
which
be
all
own
by
the
immediate
graham
family
and
the
b
share
of
which
there
be
ten
million
own
by
the
public
by
my
brother
and
by
the
profit
share
fund
start
for
employee
i
control
the
majority
of
a
share
and
my
four
child
own
the
rest
people
bought
the
b
share
know
the
company
be
family
control
warren
buffett
whose
company
berkshire
hathaway
bought
about
percent
of
the
company
s
b
share
in
later
told
me
he
didn
t
think
we
really
have
to
go
public
but
be
glad
we
have
in
fact
i
be
glad
we
have
too
although
i
still
dislike
some
of
the
responsibility
be
public
entail
the
advent
of
warren
be
only
one
of
the
positive
thing
that
result
from
our
go
public
it
give
us
some
proper
discipline
about
profit
margin
although
i
worry
about
the
overemphasis
at
time
on
the
price
of
the
stock
it
also
give
my
child
who
be
not
work
for
the
paper
a
certain
amount
of
flexibility
in
their
own
financial
management
the
date
of
the
stock
offering
be
set
for
june
in
a
ceremony
on
the
floor
of
the
american
stock
exchange
i
bought
the
first
share
for
and
we
go
public
at
a
share
this
important
step
in
the
life
of
the
washington
post
company

with
some
heighten
tension
with
the
nixon
administration

june

turn
into
one
of
the
most
dramatic
time
of
my
life
but
not
because
we
go
public
in
may
of
the
post
have
have
another
of
those

a

my
success
in
maintain
some
kind
of
relationship
with
a
few
people
in
the
white
house
i
have
never
try
with
h
r
haldeman
he
make
my
blood
run
cold
and
i
felt
sure
the
feel
be
reciprocate
the
only
time
we
ever
met
on
an
informal
basis
be
one
night
at
a
dinner
at
joe
alsop
s
when
i
sat
next
to

i
have
suggest
that
he
call
me
if
he
ever
have
problem
he
want
to
talk
about
and
the
one
time
he
do
call
have
to
do
with
tricia
s
wedding
amazingly
someone
have
prepared
a
talk
paper
for
him
on
the
point
he
should
go
over
which
come
to
light
only
a
few
year
ago
as
you
probably
know
there
s
be
considerable
discussion
back
and
forth
between
your
people
and
our
people

assignment
of
judith
martin
to
cover
the
tricia

way
a
matter

to
cover
event
or
a
punishment
of
any
kind

a
matter
of
principle
in
the
same
sense
as
break
a
backgrounder
would
be
out
of
the
some
reporter
who
cover
julie
nixon
s
wedding
all
but
two
follow
the
ground
rule
that
be
laid
out
the
two
that
broke
the
rule
be
judith
martin
and
the
other
reporter
from
the
post
i
m
sure
you
ll
understand
the
reason
behind
this
and
will
agree
that
under
the
circumstance
it
be
the
logical
action
for
us
to
take
i
trust
that
you
also
will
understand
the
desire
of
the
nixon
family
to
have
the
wedding
conduct
and
report
in
as
wholesome
and
positive
a
fashion
as
possible
since
it
be
completely
a
personal
event
not
an
official
one
and
one
that
mean
a
great
deal
to
all
of
the
family
especially
to
tricia
haldeman
phone
me
on
may
little
seem
to
have
escape
the
tap
system
in
the
white
house
since
our
extend
conversation
be
taped
and
a
transcript
make
which
turn
up
in
the
nixon
library
it
end
kg
i
wonder
if
there
isn
t
some
way
we
can
just
cool
it
but
if
you
can
think
of
anything
more
ridiculous
i
m
not
even
sure
larry
stern
knew
when
he
assign
her
that
you
know
he
wasn
t
here
when
the
first
thing
i
don
t
suppose
he
even
thought
of
it
i
just
hate
to
let
it
get
big
you
know
it
doesn
t
really
matter
to
you
or
to
us
do
it
h
no
it
probably
doesn
t
probably
doesn
t
kg
i
mean
laughter
it
really
doesn
t
matter
i
m
just
really
think
out
loud
to
see
if
there
isn
t
some
way
we
usually
there
s
some
way
of
get
both
side
off
the
hook
if
we
just
think
about
it
unless
you
just
want
to
leave
it
stand
i
m
just
afraid
it
will
be
the
ridiculous
sic
h
well
kg
so
the
thing
be
that
they
ve
make
an
issue
and
i
don
t
think
they
can
back
down
i
ll
try
to
calm
our
fellow
down
that
s
the
best
i
can
try
to
do
and
i
may
come
back
to
you
pound
the
table
but
i
don
t
honestly
care
it
s
disconcert
to
see
all
this
in
print
and
i
m
sure
i
would
have
handle
the
whole
thing
differently
later
but
i
be
in
an
embarrass
position
i
have
grave
concern
about
some
of
the
stiletto
party
coverage
that
style
seem
to
produce
and
know
how
sharp
judith
s
pen
could
be
i
actually
have
wonder
privately
why
we
have
to
take
on
this
battle
when
we
be
engage
in
so
many
more
serious
one
my
view
be
that
judy
be
an
able
even
brilliant
reporter
but
i
wasn
t
sure
i
d
want
her
to
cover
my
own
daughter
s
wedding
she
have
for
instance
already
compare
tricia
to
a
vanilla
ice
cream
cone
i
didn
t
mind
defend
us
under
most
circumstance
but
when
i
have
my
own
doubt
about
the
rightness
of
our
position
the
situation
grow
more
ambivalent
in
the
end
because
the
post
be
deny
credential
to
cover
the
wedding
the
paper
have
the
best
coverage
of
the
event
since
as
a
form
of
protest
reporter
from
other
paper
all
give
judy
their
note
place
at
her
disposal
the
fine
pool
of
material
available
to
any
reporter
in
town
the
story
in
the
post
appear
on
page
one
with
no
byline
much
more
important
be
a
piece
that
appear
on
the
same
day
june
about
a
study
of
the
vietnam
war
that
the
new
york
time
have
found
out
about
and
be
publishing
ironically
it
be
at
another
wedding
also
on
that
saturday
in
june
that
i
first
learn
about
what
come
to
be
know
as
the
pentagon

don

and
i
have
go
down

to
attend
the

be
a
casual
event
and
while

me
that

super
secret
history
of
the
decision

that
lead
us
into
and
through
vietnam
label

but
more
formally

of
the
united
state
decision
make
process
on
vietnam
policy
unbeknownst
to

the
review
have
be
commission
by
secretary
of
defense
robert
mcnamara
sometime
in
the
middle
of

mcnamara
later
say
he
have
start
the
study
to
bequeath
to

the
raw
material
from
which
they
could
re
examine
the
event
of
the
time
don
and
i
be
unclear
what
it
be
the
time
have
but
we
knew
that
whatever
it
be
it
be
important
and
that
editor
and
reporter
there
have
be
work
on
it
for
some
time
and
important
for
us
whatever
it
be
the
new
york
time
have
it
exclusively
when
we
get
back
to

i
call
the
post
s
editor
who
immediately
start
call
around
to
no
effect
ben
have
heard
rumor
start
in
the
early
spring
that
the
time
be
work
on
some
kind
of
blockbuster
but
be
not
able
to
find
out
anything
about
it
until
he
read
it
in
the
paper
himself
on
sunday
morning
i
sent
to
warrenton
for
ten
copy
of
the
time
since
there
be
a
sizable
group
stay
at
the
house
over
the
weekend
most
of
us
spent
much
of
the
day
pore
over
the
six
page
of
news
story
and
article
in
the
time
that
be
base
on
the
pentagon
paper
and
in
discuss
their
content
and
their
possible
impact
what
emerge
be
that
the
pentagon
paper
have
turn
out
to
be
in
large
part
just
what
mcnamara
have
envision
a
massive
history
of
the
role
of
the
united
state
in
indochina
which
he
have
intend
to
be
encyclopedic
and
objective
we
learn
of
a
year
and
a
half
long
study
that
have
result
in
a
three
thousand
page
narrative
history
with
a
four
thousand
page
appendix
of
document
forty
seven
volume
in
all
cover
american
involvement
in
indochina
from

of
when

talk
on
the
vietnam
war
begin
in
paris
later
we
understood
that
there
have
be
a
bitter
fight
at
the
time
over
whether
or
not
to
publish
these
so
call
top
secret
document
with

and
other
editor
argue
for

scotty
believe
always
that
this
be
a
question

of
a
high
morality
a
vast
deception
have
be
perpetrate
on
the
american
people
and
the
paper
must
publish
the

for
the
time
lord
day
and
lord
felt
so
strongly
against
publishing
that
they
ultimately
refuse
to
handle
the
case
but

the
day
we
receive
the

a
tremendous
day
for
the
post
and
for
me
as
well
our
editor
and
reporter
have
be
try
desperately
to
get
their
hand
on
the

ben
bagdikian
the
national
editor
have
guess
that
daniel
ellsberg
be
the
source
for
them
at
the
time
and
he
have
be
frantically
call
ellsberg
finally
on
the
th
a
friend
of
ellsberg
s
phone
bagdikian
and
ask
him
to
call
back
from
a
pay
phone
bagdikian
spoke
to
ellsberg
who
say
he
would
give
him
the
paper
that
night
he
then
return
to
the
paper
and
consult
with
gene
patterson
ben
bradlee
be
away
ask
for
assurance
that
if
we
get
the
paper
we
would
start
printing
them
on
friday
morning
gene
say
we
would
but
felt
bagdikian
should
check
with
bradlee
which
bagdikian
do
from
the
airport
bradlee
s
response
which
may
be
apocryphal
but
certainly
sound
like
something
ben
would
say
be
if
we
don
t
publish
there
s
go
to
be
a
new
executive
editor
of
the
washington
post
bagdikian
then
depart
for
boston
with
an
empty
suitcase
as
per
instruction
he
return
to
washington
the
next
morning
with
what
have
be
described
as
a
disorganize
mass
of
photocopy
sheet
completely
out
of
sequence
and
with
very
few
page
number
the
suitcase
he
d
brought
be
too
small
for
what
he
be
give
so
he
load
the
paper
into
a
big
cardboard
box
and
flew
back
to
washington
on
a
first
class
seat
with
the
box

the
add
pressure
of
know
that
the
time
have

from

and
that
the
washington

that
entail
i
be
pleased
that

and
have
them
in
hand
but
i
spent
the
day
of
june
in
a
rather
routine
way
i
have
plan
a
large
party
to
be
held
that
afternoon
at
my
house
for
harry
gladstein
a
lovely
man
who
be
leave
the
post
he
have
come
to
the
paper
as
circulation
director
but
be
vice
president
and
business
manager
at
the
time
the
whole
business
staff
of
the
post
be
gather
for
the
party
include
fritz
who
have
come
down
to
washington
for
it
but
have
go
over
to
ben
s
house
to
check
on
thing
there
as
it
turn
out
a
fierce
legal
battle
be
be
wag
what
ben
experienced
as
he
rush
back
and
forth
between
the
room
where
the
reporter
be
work
and
the
living
room
where
the
lawyer
be
confer
be
that
the
lawyer
seem
to
be
push
strongly
for
not
publishing
or
at
least
for
wait
until
there
be
a
decision
on
the
injunction
against
the
time
our
situation
however
be
very
different
from
that
of
the
time
the
court
order
against
them
meant
that
if
we
be
to
publish
our
action
might
be
view
as
defy
the
law
and
disrespect
the
court
even
more
difficult
than
that
be
the
delicacy
of
our
business
position
in
go
public
a
company
negotiates
with
its
underwriter
in
this
case
a
group
lead
by
lazard
fr
re
and
on
the
day
of
the
offering
everyone
agrees
on
a
price
and
sign
an
agreement
our
agreement
say
that
in
a
week
the
underwriter
would
buy
all
the
stock
from
the
company
and
then
turn
around
and
resell
it
to
those
they
d
offer
it
to
in
the
intervene
week
there
be
a
standard
stipulation
that
if
any
one
of
a
variety
of
crisis
such
as
a
war
or
national
emergency
or
more
to
the
point
in
our
case
the
company
s
be
subject
to
criminal
action
be
to
intervene
the
underwriter
would
be
let
out
of
the
contract
we
be
expose
ourselves
to
just
such
a
possibility
if
we
publish
while
the
time
be
enjoin
in
addition
fritz
have
write
into
the
original
prospectus
a
paragraph
state
that
we
would
publish
a
newspaper
dedicate
to
the
community
and
national
welfare
he
now
worried
that
the
underwriter
could
make
a
case
as
indeed
the
administration
be
try
to
do
that
what
we
be
do
be
contrary
to
the
national
welfare
fritz
have
an
extraordinary
sensitivity
to
editorial
issue
and
to
the
editor
themselves
both
at
the
post
and
at
newsweek
but
in
this
case
as
a
lawyer
he
have
to
worry
about
the
future
of
the
company
furthermore
he
worried
that
we
could
be
in
trouble
under
the
espionage
act
he
thought
the
government
would
be
most
likely
to
prosecute
the
corporation
or
the
company
and
if
the
corporation
acquire
the
status
of
a
felon
we
would
be
strip
of
our
license
to
own
and
operate
our
television
station
add
a
huge
financial
issue
to
the
already
high
stake
so
while
in
one
room
at
ben
s
house
chal
be
banging
out
his
story
for
publication
the
next
day
murrey
be
slowly
reading
through
the
material
and
don
oberdorfer
be
work
on
installment
on
the
late
johnson
year
in
another
room
the
lawyer
with
fritz
and
the
editor
be
lock
in
tough
and
tense
argument
clark
and
essaye
argue
against
publication
and
in
favor
of
let
the
time
handle
the
freedom
of
the
press
issue
fritz
seem
to
be
side
with
the
lawyer
ben
be
begin
to
feel
squeeze
between
the
editor
and
the
reporter
who
be
solidly
line
up
for
publishing
and
support
the
time
on
the
issue
of
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
lawyer
who
at
one
point
suggest
a
compromise
whereby
the
post
would
not
publish
the
paper
on
friday
but
would
notify
the
attorney
general
of
its
intention
to
publish
on
sunday
howard
simon
who
be
percent
for
publishing
summon
the
reporter
to
talk
directly
with
the
lawyer
oberdorfer
say
the
compromise
be
the
shittiest
idea
i
ve
ever
heard
robert
say
the
post
would
be
crawl
on
its
belly
to
the
attorney
general
if
the
post
didn
t
publish
he
would
move
his
retirement
up
two
week
make
it
a
resignation
and
publicly
accuse
the
post
of
cowardice
murrey
marder
recall
say
if
the
post
doesn
t
publish
it
will
be
in
much
bad
shape
as
an
institution
than
if
it

since
the
paper
s
credibility
would
be
destroyed
journalistically
for
be
gutless
bagdikian
remind
the
lawyer
of
the
commitment
to
ellsberg
to
publish
the
paper
and
declare
the
only
way
to
assert

be
to

in
the
midst
of

approach
jim
daly
have
come
up
to
me

about
when
we

get
the
story
and
be
able
to
put
it
into
print
and
ask
if
i
have
yet
heard
from
the
other
house
i
be
strangely
unconcerned
and
say
i
be
sure
they
be
just
finish
and
we
would
get
it
in
time
it
be
a
lovely
june
day
and
the
party
for
harry
spill
out
of
the
house
onto
the
terrace
and
the
lawn
i
be
make
a
toast
to
him
and
go
full
blast
about
how
much
he
have
meant
to
the
paper
and
to
me
personally
when
someone
tug
at
my
sleeve
and
say
with
some
urgency
you
re
want
on
the
phone
i
protest
that
i
have
to
finish
the
toast
but
the
response
be
they
want
you
now
i
finally
get
the
idea
that
it
be
really
important
wound
up
the
toast
quickly
and
take
the
call
in
a
corner
of
the
library
i
be
sit
on
a
small
sofa
near
the
open
door
and
paul
ignatius
stood
near
me
fritz
be
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
he
told
me
about
the
argument
between
the
lawyer
and
the
editor
over
whether
to
publish
the
next
day
outline
the
reason
on
both
side
and
conclude
by
say
i
m
afraid
you
be
go
to
have
to
decide
i
ask
fritz
for
his
own
view
since
he
be
so
editorial
mind
and
so
decent
i
knew
i
could
trust
his
response
i
be
astonish
when
he
say
i
guess
i
wouldn
t
i
then
ask
for
time
to
think
it
over
say
can
t
we
talk
about
this
why
do
we
have
to
make
up
our
mind
in
such
haste
when
the
time
take
three
month
to
decide
at
this
point
ben
and
the
editor
get
on
various
extension
at
ben
s
house
i
ask
them
what
the
big
rush
be
suggest
we
at
least
think
about
this
for
a
day
no
ben
say
it
be
important
to
keep
up
the
momentum
of
publication
and
not
to
let
a
day
intervene
after
get
the
story
he
also
stress
that
by
this
time
the
grapevine
knew
we
have
the
paper
journalist
inside
and
outside
be
watch
us
i
could
tell
from
the
passion
of
the
editor
view
that
we
be
in
for
big
trouble
on
the
editorial
floor
if
we
didn
t
publish
i
well
remember
phil
geyelin
s
response
when
i
say
that
decide
to
publish
could
destroy
the
paper
yes
he
agree
but
there
s
more
than
one
way
to
destroy
a
newspaper
at
the
same
time
that
the
editor
be
say
seriatim
you
ve
get
to
do
it
paul
ignatius
be
stand
beside
me
repeat
each
time
more
insistently
wait
a
day
wait
a
day
i
be
extremely
torn
by
fritz
s
say
that
he
wouldn
t
publish
i
knew
him
so
well
and
we
have
never
differ
on
any
important
issue
and
after
all
he
be
the
lawyer
not
i
but
i
also
heard
how
he
say
it
he
didn
t
hammer
at
me
he
didn
t
stress
the
issue
related
to
go
public
and
he
didn
t
say
the
obvious
thing
that
i
would
be
risk
the
whole
company
on
this
decision
he
simply
say
he
guess
he
wouldn
t
i
felt
that
despite
his
state
opinion
he
have
somehow
left
the
door
open
for
me
to
decide
on
a
different
course
frighten
and
tense
i
take
a
big
gulp
and
say
go
ahead
go
ahead
go
ahead
let
s
go
let
s
publish
and
i
hung
up
so
the
decision
be
make
but
later
that
even
fritz
come
over
to
my
house
roger
clark
still
worried
have
thought
of
a
new
problem
he
fear
an
extra
charge
of
collusion
with
the
time
and
want
to
know
the
source
of
our
obtain
the
paper
bagdikian
by
this
time
have
go
to
the
paper
carry
the
last
of
chal
s
story
to
set
in
type
at
first
bagdikian
maintain
that
the
source
be
confidential
but
when
clark
insist
he
identify
ellsberg
the
presume
source
for
the
time
which
only
increase
clark
s
concern
about
collusion
this
time
fritz
really
help
i
have
no
idea
whether
collusion
make
our
situation
more
vulnerable
or
not
but
fritz
say
that
we
d
make
up
our
mind
and
should
go

as
the

proceed
the

put
on
the
stand
an
ex
cia
man
who
have
be

great
moment
this
be
for
the
washington
post
ben
bradlee
be
equally
proud
he
told
the
staff
the
gut
and
energy
and
responsibility
of
everyone
involve
in
this
fight
and
the
sense
that
you
all
be
involve
have
impressed
me
more
than
anything
in
my
life
you
be
beautiful
we
have
prevail
but
ours
be
an
incomplete
victory
basically
we
be
challenge
the
right
of
the
executive
branch
to
prevent
a
newspaper
from
publishing
material
we
believe
should
be
available
to
the
public
in
court
we
have
challenged
the
government
s
contention
that
the
material
in
the
paper
be
too
sensitive
for
the
public
eye
we
have
strongly
argue
the
case
against
prior
restraint
but
we
have
in
fact
be
restrain
we
be
disappointed
that
the
court
s
decree
be
both
limited
and
ambiguous
though
the
decision
be
in
favor
of
allow
the
newspaper
to
publish
there
be
as
i
later
say
no
ring
reaffirmation
of
first
amendment
guarantee
that
all
publisher
yearn
to
hear
the
supreme
court
s
decision
have
cause
enormous
rejoice
in
the
press
at
large
and
at
the
post
and
time
in
particular
but
hidden
away
in
the
detail
of
the
separate
opinion
be
some
view
that
be
of
great
concern
to
us
have
to
do
with
possible
criminal
prosecution
after
the
fact
it
be
clear
to
us
that
attorney
general
mitchell
felt
avenue
of
criminal
prosecution
remain
open
and
that
the
department
of
justice
be
continue
its
investigation
and
would
prosecute
those
who
in
any
way
violate
federal
criminal
law
in
connection
with
the
paper
aspect
of
this
threat
be
make
even
clearer
to
me
by
two
strange
message
receive
over
the
fence
one
come
from
ken
clawson
then
still
a
post
reporter
a
few
day
after
the
supreme
court
decision
be
hand
down
clawson
told
me
he
have
have
a
message
from
richard
kleindienst
then
deputy
attorney
general
at
one
point
we
have
independently
and
in
an
effort
to
act
responsibly
decide
we
wouldn
t
publish
those
item
that
have
be
specify
in
the
solicitor
general
s
secret
brief
as
be
those
most
threaten
to
the
national
interest
we
didn
t
even
have
some
of
the
volume
of
the
paper
that
the
government
found
most
objectionable
others
we
felt
have
no
news
value
kleindienst
however
want
me
to
know
that
it
would
not
be
enough
to
agree
not
to
publish
the
portion
of
the
paper
that
the
government
felt
endanger
national
security
rather
the
post
would
have
to
relinquish
the
part
of
the
paper
it
held
relate
to
this
kind
of
information
clawson
emphasize
to
me
that
kleindienst
have
told
him
that
the
post
have
be
the
subject
of
considerable
talk
at
justice
accord
to
clawson
kleindienst
have
actually
mention
certain
regulation
bar
ownership
of
radio
and
television
property
after
conviction
for
particular
offense
he
also
told
clawson
that
our
stock
prospectus
would
have
to
carry
information
relate
to
our
be
charge
with
a
federal
crime
it
be
a
not
very
veil
threat
that
turn
over
the
paper
in
our
possession
would
go
a
long
way
toward
avoid
criminal
prosecution
kleindienst
have
no
memory
of
send
such
a
message
the
second
similar
message
come
through
gene
patterson
who
have
be
call
by
joe
alsop
i
m
not
sure
why
joe
didn
t
tell
me
directly
but
i
think
he
genuinely
believe
that
i
be
be
mislead
by
a
bunch
of
wild
men
and
be
do
me
a
favor
joe
told
gene
that
he
have
spent
some
time
with
a
high
justice
department
official
mr
x
he
want
to
convey
to
the
post
mr
x
s
feeling
and
those
of
the
government
he
talk
about
how
grim
the
situation
be
and
say
that
the
government
be
definitely
consider
proceed
criminally
against
the
new
york
time
the
post
and
other
paper
he
conclude
refer
to
nixon
and
many
of
those
in
his
administration
they
hate
the
post
like
poison
know
nixon
i
think
he
want
to
tear
out
the
gut
of
the
time
and
yours
too
i
think
there
s
an
even
chance
he
ll
proceed
on
saturday
morning
july
ben
and
i
met
in
my
office
with
edward
bennett
williams
not
because
he
be
a
lawyer
but
because
we
both
trust
him
to
discus
how
if
at
all
we
should
respond
to
what
we
have
heard
we
decide
to
respond
indirectly
through
bill
rogers
emphasize
to
him
that
we
didn
t
have
in
our
possession
the
volume
that
we
understood
contain
the
information
kleindienst
be
most
concerned
about
we
also
told
him
that
when
we
publish
anything
from
any
of
the
rest
of
the
document
we
would
not
publish
information
base
on
intercept
communication
signal
intelligence
and
cryptography
in
general
adhere
to
this
policy
as
we
have
in
the
past
in
the
end
no
far
overt
action
be
take
but
we
live
under
the
threat
of
repercussion
and
begin
to
feel
the
pressure
increase
as
the
month
wore
on
in
retrospect
it
s
hard
to
understand
why
nixon
and
his
people
be
so
upset
by
the
publication
of
these
paper
which
be
essentially
a
history
of
decision
make
before
they
be
in
power
nothing
in
them
be
a
reflection
on
nixon
i
believe
the
administration
s
reaction
be
an
example
of
its
extreme
paranoia
about
national
security
and
secrecy
in
general
certainly
their
paranoia
be
evident
early
on
griswold
acknowledge
as
much
in
an
op
ed
article
for
the
post
title
secret
not
worth
keep
that
appear
in
february
of
at
the
time
of
iran
contra
say
that
there
be
a
massive
overclassification
by
the
government
and
that
the
principal
concern
of
the
classifier
be
not
with
national
security
but
rather
with
governmental
embarrassment
of
one
sort
or
another
t
here
be
very
rarely
any
real
risk
to
current
national
security
from
the
publication
of
fact
relate
to
transaction
in
the
past
even
the
fairly
recent
past
this
be
the
lesson
of
the
pentagon
paper
experience
in
fact
only
a
tiny
portion
of
the
content
of
the
paper
be
really
secret
material
and
daniel
ellsberg
the
original
provider
of
the
paper
have
withheld
those
portion
from
the
begin
at
the
end
of
i
discuss
the
issue
surround
publication
of
the
pentagon
paper
in
a
speech
i
give
at
denison
university
i
still
maintain
what
i
say
then
which
be
essentially
that
we
believe
from
the
start
that
the
material
in
the
pentagon
paper
be
just
the
kind
of
information
the
public
need
in
order
to
form
its
opinion
and
make
its
choice
more
wisely
in
short
we
believe
the
paper
be
so
useful
to
a
great
understand
of
the
way
in
which
america
become
involve
in
the
vietnam
war
that
we
regard
their
publication
not
as
a
breach
of
the
national
security
as
the
administration
claimed
but
rather
as
a
contribution
to
the
national
interest
indeed
as
the
obligation
of
a
responsible
newspaper
as
i
conclude
in
that
speech
twenty
five
year
ago
and
as
i
strongly
still
believe
the
sober
reality
be
that
the
process
laid
bare
in
the
pentagon
paper
be
precisely
the
process
by
which
most
of
the
business
of
government
be
carry
forward
we
may
wholeheartedly
embrace
the
pledge
of
no
more
vietnam
but
until
we
open
up
the
system
and
expose
its
working
to
the
light
of
public
scrutiny
that
pledge
will
remain
in
the
realm
of
empty
rhetoric
needle
to
say
the
minor
irritation
experienced
between
the
post
and
the
nixon
administration
prior
to
this
which
have
slowly
ratchet
up
the
tension
in
the
overall
atmosphere
have
now
turn
major
the
pentagon
paper
case
take
the
continual
day
to
day
spar
between
government
and
the
press
onto
a
new
level
ruler
and
reporter
may
be
natural
antagonist
as
i
say
at
the
time
but
the
nixon
administration
now
enter
the
ring
with
a
particularly
deliberate
gusto
by
send
the
justice
department
into
court
instead
of
merely
use
the
vice
president
as
a
mouthpiece
they
have
change
the
character
of
the
fight
we
all
begin
to
worry
more
and
more
about
freedom
of
the
press
and
about
the
nixon
administration
s
imperious
attitude
that
the
authority
to
determine
what
the
american
people
should
know
rest
exclusively
with
the
government
we
also
felt
as
ben
later
say
that
if
the
press
be
the
target
the
victim
be
the
public
the
pentagon
paper
may
or
may
not
have
be
the
compelling
case
we
all
thought
it
be
but
it
set
in
motion
certain
trend
although
the
case
come
and
go
unbelievably
in
only
two
and
a
half
week
its
ripple
effect
be
great
and
publishing
the
paper
go
a
long
way
toward
advance
the
interest
of
the
post
as
ben
later
say
that
be
a
key
moment
in
the
life
of
this
paper
it
be
just
sort
of
the
graduation
of
the
post
into
the
high
rank
one
of
our
unspoken
goal
be
to
get
the
world
to
refer
to
the
post
and
new
york
time
in
the
same
breath
which
they
previously
hadn
t
do
after
the
pentagon
paper
they
do
from
my
point
of
view
the
post
and
i
have
be
hurl
onto
the
national
scene
almost
unwittingly
for
the
first
time
in
my
professional
life
we
become
major
player
eye
be
on
us
what
we
do
matter
to
the
press
and
to
the
country
to
some
degree
i
gain
a
measure
of
self
assurance
this
be
my
first
serious
visibility
on
the
national
scene
i
be
very
publicly
expose
write
about
photograph
and
interviewed
which
both
sear
me
and
to
some
extent
fed
my
ego
the
pressure
the
intensity
and
the
rapidly
unfold
development
be
another
extraordinary
learn
experience
for
me
the
whole
affair
also
bound
many
of
us
at
the
post
even
more
closely
together
especially
ben
howard
simon
phil
geyelin
meg
greenfield
and
me
the
editor
have
be
wonderful
from
the
late
s
these
people
have
work
so
well
together
have
a
great
deal
of
fun
at
the
same
time
there
be
trust
and
affection
among
them
as
well
as
between
them
and
me
our
group
be
one
of
the
great
strength
that
kept
me
go
and
lighten
my
life
i
gain
even
more
confidence
in
ben
he
and
i
have
already
create
a
true
understand
between
us
as
well
as
a
respect
and
admiration
for
each
other
but
until
the
pentagon
paper
we
have
never
be
test
publicly
in
any
way
ben
later
say
that
not
publishing
the
paper
could
have
be
a
real
disaster
for
the
post
with
many
people
quit
the
paper
he
reflect
that
he
himself
probably
wouldn
t
have
quit
but
i
would
have
be
beaten
and
the
goal
the
aspiration
that
we
be
just
begin
to
see
would
have
be
lose
what
ben
and
i
told
each
other
at
the
time
say
a
lot
about
the
point
to
which
our
relationship
have
evolve
and
how
much
we
depend
on
and
appreciate
each
other
ben
have
start
a
tradition
of
write
me
a
letter
at
christmastime
in
lieu
of
flower
i
always
respond
in
kind
but
i
write
him
now
in
the
middle
of
the
year
on
the
very
day
the
supreme
court
announce
its
decision
we
always
write
each
other
love
letter
at
christmas
but
the
paper
over
the
last
week
be
well
than
christmas
and
it
s
earlier
too
there
never
be
such
a
show
it
be
incredible
and
it
be
only
possible
because
of
that
extra
of
the
that
you
and
those
under
you
put
into
it
it
be
beautiful
and
fun
too
and
it
be
a
trip
a
pleasure
to
do
business
with
you
as
ever
ben
write
me
right
back
do
business
with
you
be
so
much
more
than
a
pleasure
it
s
a
cause
it
s
an
honor
and
such
a
reward
challenge
i
m
not
sure
i
could
handle
another
one
of
these
tomorrow
but
it
be
so
great
to
know
that
this
whole
newspaper
will
handle
the
next
one
with
courage
and
commitment
and
style
indeed
publishing
the
pentagon
paper
make
future
decision
easy
even
possible
most
of
all
it
prepared
us
and
i
suspect
unfortunately
nixon
as
well
for
watergate

for

investigative
and

now
but
then
two
young
men
who
have
never
work
together
one
of
whom
woodward
have
not
even
be
long
at
the
paper
in
some
way
it
be
a
natural
pair
since
their
quality
and
skill
complement
each
other
both
be
bright
but
woodward
be
conscientious
hardworking
and
driven
and
bernstein
messy
and
undisciplined
he
be
however
the
well
writer
more
imaginative
and
creative
in
other
way
the
relationship
be
oil
and
water
but
the
end
product
come
out
right
despite
or
perhaps
because
of
the
strange
mix
barry
sussman
with
only
a
few
detail
about
the
botch
burglary
knew
that
he
want
bob
woodward
on
the
story
woodward
have
come
to
us
fresh
from
the
navy
have
be
accepted
by
harvard
law
school
he
have
chosen
instead
to
pursue
journalism
as
a
career
he
so
much
want
to
work
for
the
post
that
harry
rosenfeld
have
told
his
deputy
andy
barnes
to
put
woodward
on
for
two
week
without
pay
and
to
look
at
his
copy
every
night
to
see
what
he
could
do
not
one
of
the
seventeen
story
bob
write
during
those
two
week
be
print
and
at
the
end
of
the
trial
period
barnes
confidently
declare
that
woodward
be
a
bright
and
good
guy
but
lack
the
skill
need
for
be
a
newspaperman
in
short
be
hopeless
and
would
be
too
much
trouble
to
train
harry
told
woodward
to
get
some
experience
and
come
back
in
a
year
to
woodward
this
be
a
kick
in
the
stomach
but
also
an
inspiration
and
he
didn
t
interpret
harry
s
part
word
as
a
total
rejection
it
may
have
be
wishful
think
on
bob
s
part
since
for
him
the
point
be
that
in
fail
for
two
week
at
journalism
i
knew
i
love
it
so
bob
go
off
and
get
a
job
on
the
nearby
montgomery
county
sentinel
in
maryland
where
it
wasn
t
long
before
he
begin
scoop
the
post

metro
reporter
after
some
month
he
start
phone
harry
again
one
day
he
call
him
at
home
interrupt
his
vacation
and
find
him
on
a
ladder
painting
his
basement
have
already
be

more
time
than
he
felt
warrant
for
a
man
on
vacation
harry
be
in
a
foul
temper
and
complain
to
his
wife
anne
about
this
young
upstart
call
him
up
all
the
time
and
pester
him
anne
quietly
ask
isn
t
that
what
you
always
say
be
the
kind
of
person
you
want
harry
she
be
of
course
exactly
right
and
harry
finally
decide
to
hire
woodward
who
start
at
the
post
right
after
labor
day
in
september
the
day
as
bob
later
told
me
unbeknownst
to
all
of
us
that
howard
hunt
and
gordon
liddy

psychiatrist
s
house
from
the

bob
distinguish
himself
and
there
be
no
question
in
the
editor
mind
whom
they
be
go
to
send
to
court
to
cover
the
breakin
carl
bernstein
on
the
other
hand
have
be
at
the
post
since
the
fall
of
but
have
not
distinguish
himself
he
be
a
good
writer
but
his
poor
work
habit
be
well
know
throughout
the
city
room
even
then
as
be
his
famous
rove
eye
in
fact
one
thing
that
stood
in
the
way
of
carl
s
be
put
on
the
story
be
that
ben
bradlee
be
about
to
fire
him
carl
be
notorious
for
an
irresponsible
expense

car
and
abandon
it
in
a
parking
lot
present
the
company
with
an
enormous
bill
but
carl
look
over
bob
s
shoulder
while
he
rework
al
lewis
s
note
immediately
get
hooked
on
this
strange
story
and
be
off
and
run
it
be
harry
who
save
him
when
both
ben
and
howard
want
to
fire
him
say
that
he
be
pursue
the
watergate
story
with
verve
work
hard
and
contribute
a
great
deal
and
it
be
carl
who
make
the
first
connection
of
the
crisp
new
bill
in
the
pocket
of
the
burglar
to
money
raise
for
the
nixon
campaign
woodward
and
bernstein
clearly
be
the
key
reporter
on
the
story
so
much
so
that
we
begin
to
refer
to
them
collectively
as
wood
stein
but
the
cast
of
character
at
the
post
who
contribute
to
the
story
from
its
inception
be
considerable
as
executive
editor
ben
be
the
classic
leader
at
whose
desk
the
buck
of
responsibility
stop
he
set
the
ground
rule
push
push
push
not
so
subtly
ask
everyone
to
take
one
more
step
relentlessly
pursue
the
story
in
the
face
of
persistent
accusation
against
us
and
a
concert
campaign
of
intimidation
howard
simon
with
his
semi
independent
pocket
of
authority
on
the
paper
help
move
the
story
along
enormously
particularly
with
his
attitude
as
woodward
later
described
it
of
inquisitiveness
and
let
s
find
out
what
s
go
on
harry
rosenfeld
say
of
howard
when
the
kid
be
run
one
way
or
the
other
he
would
if
it
be
call
for
stand
up
and
screw
the
tide
it
be
howard
who
carry
the
story
in
its
early
day
harry
himself
be
an
old
style
tough
picturesque
editor
and
another
real
hero
of
watergate
for
us
from
the
outset
he
thought
of
the
story
as
a
very
big
local
one
see
it
as
something
on
which
the
post
s
local
staff
could
distinguish
itself
he
control
the
story
before
it
regularly
make
page

of
the
paper
keep
it
go
on

editor
to
devote
full
time
to
direct
the
day
to

he
be
just
the
person
for
the
job
as
described
by
woodward
and
bernstein
in
all
the
president
s
men
sussman
have
the
ability
to
seize
fact
and
lock
them
in
his
memory
where
they
remain

two
week
later
a
seminal
bernstein
and
woodward
article
appear
on
page
one
of
the
post
they
have
dug
up
information
that
there

safe
of
maurice

people

of
whom
be
john
mitchell
and
which
be
to
be
use
to
gather
intelligence
on
the
democrat
thus
the
story
reach
a
new
level
involve
mitchell
himself
not
only
in
his
new
role
in
the
campaign
but
when
he

still
attorney
general
since
woodward
and
bernstein
have
unearthed
mitchell
authorize
expenditure
from
the
fund
from
the
previous
year
crp
deny
the
story
artfully
and
graphically
in
an
effort
to
check
it
out
bernstein
have
be
told
by
a
press
aide
at
crp
that
there
be
absolutely
no
truth
to
the
charge
call
mitchell
directly
reach
him
at
a
hotel
in
new
york
where
mitchell
answer
the
phone
himself
when
carl
told
him
about
the
story
mitchell
explode
with
exclamation
of
jeeeeeeesus
so
violent
that
carl
felt
it
be
some
sort
of
primal
scream
and
thought
mitchell
might
die
on
the
telephone
after
he
d
read
him
the
first
two
paragraph
mitchell
interrupt
still
scream
all
that
crap
you
re
put
it
in
the
paper
it
s
all
be
deny
katie
graham
s
gonna
get
her
tit
caught
in
a
big
fat
wringer
if
that
s
publish
good
christ
that
s
the
most
sicken
thing
i
ever
heard
bernstein
be
stun
and
call
ben
at
home
to
read
him
mitchell
s
quote
and
discus
add
them
to
the
already
prepared
article
ben
told
carl
to
use
it
all
except
the
specific
reference
to
my
tit
the
quote
be
change
to
read
that
i
be
gonna
get
caught
in
a
big
fat
wringer
ben
decide
he
didn
t
have
to
forewarn
me
later
he
told
me
that
be
too
good
to
check
with
you
katharine
i
would
have
agree
with
ben
s
decision
as
it
be
i
be
shock
to
read
what
i
do
in
the
paper
but
even
more
so
to
hear
what
mitchell
have
actually
say
so
personal
and
offensive
be
the
threat
and
the
message
i
ran
into
carl
by
accident
the
next
day
and
ask
him
if
he
have
any
other
message
for
me
it
be
quite
a
temper
tantrum
on
mitchell
s
part
and
especially
strange
of
him
to
call
me
katie
which
no
one
have
ever
call
me
bob
later
observe
that
the
interest
thing
for
him
be
that
mitchell
s
remark
be
an
example
of
the
misperception
on
the
part
of
the
nixon
people
that
i
be
call
all
the
shot
and
that
i
be
the
one
who
be
printing
everything
on
watergate
in
any
case
the
remark
live
on
in
the
annals
of
watergate
and
be
one
of
the
principal
public
link
of
me
with
the
affair
later
though
before
watergate
have
end
i
receive
a
wonderful
present
from
a
california
dentist
who
use
the
kind
of
gold
normally
use
to
fill
teeth
have
craft
a
little
wringer
complete
with
a
tiny
handle
and
gear
that
turn
just
like
a
regular
old
wash
machine
wringer
and
some
time
after
that
art
buchwald
present
me
with
a
tiny
gold
breast
which
he
have
have
make
to
go
with
the
wringer
i
occasionally
wore
the
two
of
them
together
on
a
chain
around
my
neck
and
stop
only
when
a
reporter
threaten
to
tell
maxine
cheshire
in
october
the
tempo
of
the
whole
story
picked
up

the
great
political
scandal
of
this

the
brazen
manner
in

without
benefit
of
clergy
the
washington

have
set
up
housekeep
with
the
mcgovern
campaign
the

reputation
for
objectivity
and
credibility
have
sunk
so
low
they
have
almost
disappear
from
the

altogether
there
be
a
cultural

social
affinity
between
the
mcgovernites

to
the
american
people
who
chapin
be
and
that
he
saw
the

it
have
be
difficult
to
make
the
connection
between
this

those
in

would
move
the

line
right
through
the

of

the

note
that

unfortunately
make
one
of
their
only
error
throughout
the
long
month
of
reporting
the
substance
of
the
story
be
true
the
error
be
not
of
fact
but
of
assumption
woodward
and
bernstein
have
assume
that
hugh
sloan
former
crp
treasurer
and
former
haldeman
aide
have
told
the
grand
jury
about
the
secret
fund
he
have
in
fact
told
woodward
and
bernstein
about
it
and
the
only
reason
he
hadn
t
told
the
grand

be
that
he
hadn
t
be
ask
sloan
through
his
attorney
deny
the

story
the
next
morning
set
off
repercussion
everywhere
include
more
denunciation
of
the
paper
by
ron
ziegler
at
the
white

who
unequivocally
deny
the

of

politically
motivate
and
attack
ben
bradlee
for

some
of
the
strong
reverberation

have
work
on
this
particular
story
up
until
deadline
believe
that
the
tie
to
haldeman
meant
that
nixon
be
really
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
as
harry
say
if
haldeman
be
do
it
nixon
be
do
it
there
be
no
line
between
haldeman
and
nixon
harry
be
apoplectic
at
the
idea
that
the
reporter
have
gotten
the
story
wrong
he
and
howard
simon
be
discuss
correction
and
desperately
look
for
woodward
and
bernstein
who
be
nowhere
to
be
found
ironically
those
two
turn
out
to
be
meeting
with
a
publisher
to
discus
the
book
they
intend
to
write
about
watergate
when
they
be
finally
locate
the
reporter
with
rosenfeld
who
refuse
to
retract
the
story
until
he
knew
more
go
down
to
the
courthouse
the
next
day
we
do
retract
the
part
of
the
story
that
say
sloan
have
told
the
grand
jury
of
haldeman
s
connection
to
the
fund
but
the
substance
of
the
story
remain
i
be
feel
beleaguer
the
constant
attack
on
us
by
crp
and
people
throughout
the
administration
be
effective
and
take
their
toll
during
these
month
the
pressure
on
the
post
to
cease
and
desist
be
intense
and
uncomfortable
to
say
the
least
but
unbelievable
as
the
revelation
be
the
strong
evidence
of
their
accuracy
be
part
of
what
kept
us
go
many
of
my
friend
be
puzzle
about
our
reporting
joe
alsop
be
press
me
all
the
time
and
i
have
a
distress
chance
meeting
with
henry
kissinger
just
before
the
election
at
a
big
reception
of
some
kind
what
s
the
matter
don
t
you
think
we
re
go
to
be
reelect
henry
ask
me
seem
quite
upset
i
assure
him
that
i
could
read
the
overwhelm
poll
as
well
as
anybody
and
hadn
t
the
slightest
doubt
that
nixon
would
be
reelect
henry
later
told
me
that
although
he
be
never
part
of
any
actual
discussion
that
related
to
threat
he
knew
nixon
want
to
get
even
with
a
lot
of
people
after
the
election
maybe
this
have
be
his
way
of
warn
me
in
any
case
the
implication
in
henry
s
exclamation
add
to
my
tension
reader
too
be
write
me
accuse
the
post
of
ulterior
motif
bad
journalism
lack
of
patriotism
and
all
kind
of
breach
of
faith
in
our
effort
to
get
the
news
to
the
people
it
be
a
particularly
lonely
moment
for
us
at
the
paper
other
organization
be
begin
to
report
the
story
but
we
be
so
far
ahead
that
they
couldn
t
catch
up
woodward
and
bernstein
have
most
of
the
source
to
themselves
the
wire
service
and
ap
sent
out
our
story
but
most
paper
didn
t
even
run
them
or
bury
them
somewhere
toward
the
back
page
howard
use
to
get
on
the
phone
to
his
editor
friend
around
the
country
to
tell
them
they
be
miss
a
big
story
because
an
exclusive
story
usually
remain
so
for
only
about
twenty
four
hour
before
everyone
jumped
on
it
i
sometimes
privately
thought
if
this
be
such
a
hell
of
a
story
then
where
be
everybody
else
bearing
the
full
brunt
of
presidential
wrath
be
always
disturb
sometimes
i
wonder
if
we
could
survive
four
more
year
of
this
kind
of
strain
of
the
pressure
of
living
with
an
administration
so
completely
at
odds
with
us
and
determine
to
harm
us
as
i
later
write
to
isaiah
berlin
the
idea
of
living
with
that
gang
in
the
white
house
whack
at
you
for
four
more
year
be
depress
beyond
word
i
couldn
t
help
speculate
about
what
condition
we
d
all
be
in
include
the
paper
at
the
end
of
it
the
best
we
could
do
while
under
such
siege
i
felt
be
to
keep
investigate
to
look
everywhere
for
hard
evidence
to
get
the
detail
right
and
to
report
accurately
what
we
found
just
as
the
stress
of
loneliness
be
at
their
most
extreme
immediately
before
the
election
we
get
a
break
cbs
in
the
person
of
walter
cronkite
and
gordon
man
then
a
producer
and
an
ex
newsweek
editor
decide
to
run
two
long
piece
on
watergate
on
the
even
news
basically
the
story
have
not
appear
on
television
to
begin
with
it
wasn
t
easy
for
television
to
report
watergate
in
sound
bite
there
be
few
if
any
picture
opportunity
and
it
be
an
extremely
complicate
hard
to
follow
story
full
of
name
of
people
unknown
to
the
public
there
be
many
different
thread
to
the
story
and
it
be
difficult
to
see
how
it
all
come
together
and
then
as
i
be
soon
to
learn
firsthand
television
and
radio
be
vulnerable
rely
as
they
do
on
a
government
agency
for
their
license
to
operate
the
three
television
network
all
own
local
radio
or
television
station
from
which
a
large
part
of
their
profitability
derive
so
it
take
even
more
than
normal
courage
for
them
to
take
on
the
government
but
cronkite
who
be
the
supreme
authority
on
his
show
decide
to
go
ahead
man
who
knew
ben
from
newsweek
try
to
get
his
help
for
cbs
s
program
and
be
startle
and
dubious
when
ben
told
him
we
have
no
document
no
paper
trail
of
evidence
and
couldn
t
help
the
first
piece
air
on
the
even
of
friday
october
and
take
fourteen
of
the
twenty
two
minute
of
that
night
s
network
news
more
time
than
have
ever
be
give
to
any
single
story
fill
largely
by
quote
the
post
and
the
government
s
various
reply
to
the
paper
s
charge
i
will
never
forget
my
joy
and
relief
to
have
cbs
news
behind
us
piece
the
story
together
and
carefully
explain
to
a
national
audience
what
have
happen
what
have
be
prove
and
what
have
not
cronkite
give
us
great
credit
and
the
still
photo
of
the
post
and
its
headline
in
the
background
help
enormously
the
show
ran
eleven
day
before
the
election
also
watch
the
cbs
even
news
be
the
white
house
tough
guy
chuck
colson
who
be
assign
to
oversee
the
network
colson
become
know
for
say
that
he
would
walk
over
his
grandmother
if
it
be
necessary
to
do
a
job
he
have
gotten
wind
of
the
show
call
frank
stanton
and
then
go
straight
to
bill
paley
stanton
have
work
hard
at
cbs
to
protect
press
freedom
and
the
news
division
but
paley
have
not
experienced
call
from
angry
president
or
their
flunky
so
he
flinch
at
colson
s
call
and
in
turn
summon
the
head
of
news
richard
salant
and
lean
on
him
very
hard
about
the
evil
of
the
piece
that
have
already
be
air
and
the
necessity
of
kill
the
propose
second
part
to
be
run
the
next
night
after
a
fight
within
cbs
news
salant
compromise
and
on
the
ground
of
repetition
of
what
have
already
appear
on
the
network
the
second
piece
be
cut
from
fourteen
minute
to
eight
in
the
end
the
length
of
the
report
didn
t
really
matter
cbs
have
take
the
post
national
even
against
bill
paley
s
frighten
will
i
spent
the
day
after
the
first
cbs
story
air
at
glen
welby
with
a
large
group
of
guest
include
my
friend
pam
berry
by
then
lady
hartwell
clay
felker
dick
holbrooke
and
most
interestingly
peter
peterson
nixon
s
secretary
of
commerce
at
the
time
and
his
then
wife
sally
a
liberal
democrat
sally
be
quite
vocal
in
her
view
and
there
be
several
awkward
moment
during
the
weekend
particularly
when
she
announce
emphatically
that
she
would
be
voting
for
mcgovern
which
actually
be
know
to
the
white
house
and
make
remark
openly
critical
of
the
administration
at
one
point
say
nixon
have
no
ball
we
all
squirm
but
it
be
also
noticeable
that
pete
didn
t
come
to
his
bos
s
defense
in
the
middle
of
a
tennis
game
pete
be
call
to
the
phone
by
a
white
house
operator
who
have
place
the
call
for
haldeman
have
to
locate
pete
at
my
house
undoubtedly
be
a
factor
in
the
administration
s
later
get
rid
of
him
it
be
not
a
win
card
to
be
weekend
at
glen
welby
although
henry
kissinger
didn
t
seem
to
suffer
within
the
administration
even
though
he
go
on
come
to
my
house
but
not
to
the
post
during
watergate
pete
remain
a
friend
of
mine
throughout
our
reporting
of
watergate
in
fact
he
told
me
that
after
the
post
s
late
october
story
my
name
come
up
in
white
house
staff
meeting
even
more
often
than
before
have
heard
plenty
of
comment
that
they
be
go
to
get
me
pete
come
to
my
office
by
himself
one
day
to
say
kay
i
don
t
know
what
the
truth
be
but
there
be
a
group
of
very
angry
people
who
feel
you
be
out
to
get
them
i
hope
you
be
use
rigorous
journalistic
standard
if
you
be
wrong
it
s
serious
they
will
get
you
i
appreciate
the
spirit
in
which
pete
courageously
come
to
see
me
and
assure
him
that
i
heard
what
he
be
say
and
that
we
be
be
careful
indeed
we
be
we
always
do
our
best
to
be
careful
and
responsible
especially
when
we
be
carry
the
burden
of
the
watergate
reporting
from
the
outset
the
editor
have
resolve
to
handle
the
story
with
more
than
the
usual
scrupulous
attention
to
fairness
and
detail
they
laid
down
certain
rule
which
be
follow
by
everyone
first
every
bit
of
information
attribute
to
an
unnamed
source
have
to
be
support
by
at
least
one
other
independent
source
particularly
at
the
start
of
watergate
we
have
to
rely
heavily
on
confidential
source
but
at
every
step
we
double
checked
every
bit
of
material
before
printing
it
where
possible
we
have
three
or
even
more
source
for
each
story
second
we
ran
nothing
that
be
report
by
any
other
newspaper
television
radio
station
or
other
medium
outlet
unless
it
be
independently
verify
and
confirm
by
our
own
reporter
third
every
word
of
every
story
be
read
by
at
least
one
of
the
senior
editor
before
it
go
into
print
with
a
top
editor
vet
each
story
before
it
ran
as
any
journalist
know
these
be
rigorous
test
yet
despite
the
care
i
knew
everyone
be
take
i
be
still
worried
no
matter
how
careful
we
be
there
be
always
the
nag
possibility
that
we
be
wrong
be
set
up
be
mislead
ben
would
repeatedly
reassure
me
possibly
to
a
great
extent
than
he
may
have
actually
felt
by
say
that
some
of
our
source
be
republican
sloan
especially
and
that
have
the
story
almost
exclusively
give
us
the
luxury
of
not
have
to
rush
into
print
so
that
we
could
be
obsessive
about
check
everything
there
be
many
time
when
we
delayed
publishing
something
until
the
test
have
be
met
there
be
time
when
something
just
didn
t
seem
to
hold
up
and
accordingly
be
not
publish
and
there
be
a
number
of
instance
where
we
withheld
something
not
sufficiently
confirmable
that
turn
out
later
to
be
true
at
the
time
i
take
comfort
in
our
two
source
policy
ben
far
assure
me
that
woodward
have
a
secret
source
he
would
go
to
when
he
wasn
t
sure
about
something
a
source
that
have
never
mislead
us
that
be
the
first
i
heard
of
deep
throat
even
before
he
be
so
name
by
howard
simon
after
the
pornographic
movie
that
be
popular
in
certain
circle
at
the
time
it
s
why
i
remain
convince
that
there
be
such
a
person
and
that
he
and
it
have
to
be
a
he
be
neither
make
up
nor
an
amalgam
or
a
composite
of
a
number
of
people
as
have
often
be
hypothesize
the
identity
of
deep
throat
be
the
only
secret
i
m
aware
of
that
ben
have
kept
and
of
course
bob
and
carl
have
too
i
never
ask
to
be
let
in
on
the
secret
except
once
facetiously
and
i
still
don
t
know
who
he
be
this
attention
to
detail
and
play
by
our
own
strict
rule
allow
us
to
produce
as
harry
rosenfeld
later
say
the
long
run
newspaper
story
with
the
least
amount
of
error
that
i
have
ever
experienced
or
will
ever
experience
the
impact
of
our
october
story
and
the
cbs
broadcast
continued
to
reverberate
on
nixon
and
his
administration
and
on
us
there
be
a
good
deal
of
evidence
that
the
campaign
to
undermine
public
confidence
in
the
post
and
in
any
other
news
medium
thought
to
be
hostile
to
the
administration
be
intensify
the
investigation
of
such
a
tangle
web
of
crime
money
and
mischief
would
have
be
hard
enough
under
the
best
of
circumstance
but
it
be
make
harder
give
the
unveiled
threat
and
major
and
minor
harassment
by
a
president
and
his

chuck

be
quote
by
a
star
reporter
as
say
as
soon
as
the
election
be
behind
us
we
re
go
to
really
shove
it
to
the
post
start
come
around
with
a
breadbasket
because
we
re
go
to
fill
it
up
with
news
and
that
s
only
the
begin
after
that
we
re
really
go
to
get
rough
they
re
go
to
wish
on
l
street
that
they
d
never
heard
of
watergate
i
particularly
loathe
report
that
personalize
the
whole
dispute
imply
that
some
sort
of
personal
vendetta
have
poison
the
relationship
between
the
post
and
the
administration
i
have
already
begin
to
hear
a
chorus
of
rumor
concern
my
own
feeling
about
nixon
a
chorus
that
warm
up
with
some
help
from
senator
dole
who
make
a
charge
picked
up
and
carry
all
over
the
airwave
say
that
i
have
told
a
friend
that
i
hat
nixon
dole
make
the
leap
to
say
that
that
be
the
reason
the
post
be
write
all
the
negative
watergate
story
i
detest
the
assumption
and
impression
that
we
be
out
to
get
nixon
that
we
somehow
have
it
in
for
him
and
for
the
republican
many
people
misunderstood
the
role
of
the
post
believe
that
we
get
some
sort
of
enjoyment
out
of
kick
the
president
and
the
republican
or
extract
every
last
drop
of
blood
as
i
heard
more
than
once
far
from
its
be
our
aim
or
purpose
we
get
no
pleasure
from
it
as
i
write
someone
it
s
the
only
government
we
have
and
it
would
be
a
lot
big
pleasure
not
to
have
to
report
the
kind
of
thing
we
do
incredibly
i
be
still
in
touch
with
john
ehrlichman
from
time
to
time
so
i
write
him
on
the
day
before
the
election
a
short
while
back
you
threw
me
a
message
over
the
fence
and
i
genuinely
appreciate
it
here
be
a
message
i
want
to
send
you
among
the
charge
that
have
be
fly
over
the
past
few
week
many
have
disturbed
me
for
the
general
misunderstand
they
suggest
of
the
post
s
purpose
in
printing
the
story
we
do
but
none
have
disturbed
me
more
than
an
allegation
senator
dole
make
it
be
that
the
post
s
point
of
view
on
certain
substantive
issue
be
explain
by
me
as
proceed
from
the
simple
fact
that
i
hate
the
president
there
be
so
many
thing
wrong
with
this
anecdote
that
one
hardly
know
where
to
begin
in
correct
them
but
i
would
begin
with
the
fact
that
i
cannot
imagine
that
the
episode
ever
take
place
at
all
or
that
i
ever
express
such
a
childish
and
mindless
sentiment
since
it
be
one
that
i
do
not
feel
i
want
you
to
know
that
and
i
also
want
you
to
know
that
the
fiction
doesn
t
stop
there
for
the
story
suggests
as
well
that
somehow
editorial
position
on
public
issue
be
take
and
decision
on
news
make
on
the
basis
of
the
publisher
s
personal
feeling
and
taste
this
be
not
true
even
when
the
sentiment
attribute
to
me
unlike
this
allege
and
unworthy
hate
for
the
president
may
be
real
what
appear
in
the
post
be
not
a
reflection
of
my
personal
feeling
and
by
the
same
token
i
would
add
that
my
continue
and
genuine
pride
in
the
paper
s
performance
over
the
past
few
month
the
period
that
seem
to
be
at
issue
do
not
proceed
from
some
sense
that
it
have
gratify
my
personal
whim
it
proceeds
from
my
belief
that
the
editor
and
reporter
have
fulfil
the
high
standard
of
professional
duty
and
responsibility
on
this
i
know
we
disagree
i
be
write
this
note
because
i
think
we
have
enough
such
area
of
sharp
and
honest
disagreement
between
us
not
to
need
a
harmful
and
destructive
overlay
of
personal
animosity
that
i
for
one
don
t
feel
and
don
t
wish
to
see
perpetuate
by
misquotation
my
turn
it
seem
i
genuinely
meant
what
i
write
ehrlichman
i
have
a
faint
memory
of
talk
to
stew
alsop
once
about
how
as
the
month
progress
i
be
certainly
feel
more
and
more
negative
about
nixon
but
i
have
no
such
personal
feeling
about
nixon
as
a
politician
and
couldn
t
imagine
that
i
have
say
anything
like
dole
s
quote
in
his
speech
much
less
that
my
feeling
toward
the
president
would
inspire
the
post
s
editor
and
reporter

though
the
editorial
page
editor
and
his
deputy
and
writer
be
certainly
not
in
agreement
with
george
mcgovern
s
view
and
policy
the
post
s
editorial
page
which
didn
t
endorse
have
vaguely
seem
to
favor
mcgovern
partly
because
it
be
so
unsympathetic
to
nixon
candidate
mcgovern
have
use
the
watergate
story
only
somewhat
tentatively
ironically
he
too
felt
that
the
coverage
he
receive
in
the
post
have
not
be
ample
enough
or
accurate
or
fair
a
feel
share
by
almost
every
candidate
about
almost
every
paper
anywhere
and
at
any
time
to
no
one
s
surprise
president
nixon
be
reelect
by
a
landslide
with
percent
of
the
vote
and
forty
nine
out
of
fifty
state
evidence
of
how
little
impact
watergate
have
have
and
how
very
powerful
be
these
angry
and
vindictive
men
in
the
white
house
and
connect
with
the
president
elsewhere
however
instead
of
become
more
secure
with
his
victory
in
hand
and
work
to
unite
the
country
nixon
immediately
turn
to
vengeance
and
to
strengthen
his
hold
on
power
in
a
speech
at
his
victory
dinner
with
member
of
the

everyone
in
the
upper
echelon
of
his

to
resign
and
set
out
to
replace
anyone
even
good
republican
who
might
not
agree
with
him
implicitly

the
first
victim

pete
peterson
who
be
politely
fire
soon
after
the
election
the
wall
street
journal
ran
an
article
at
the
time
speculate
openly
on
what

on
all
our
mind
that

knifed

with
the
atmosphere
between

its
most
poisonous
the
watergate
story
dry
up
our
have
nothing
new
to
report

the
idea
that
the
whole
story
have
be
political
to
begin
with
a
baseless
bias

on
the

hurt
if
you
just
write
an
occasional

what

them
to

even
deeper
to

at
the

which
of
course
they
do
later
on
i
add
a
note
to
the
file
about
something
ben
say
that
apply
to
this
period
when
the

seem
to

go
nowhere
his
comment
reflect
his
attitude
then
and
always
low
profile
be
a
lot
of
shit
that
fall
after
the
election
partly
in
response
to
the
escalate
campaign
we
felt
be
be
wag
against
the
reputation
of
the
post
i
begin
to
make
more
speech
defend
the
press
in
general
and
the
post
in
particular
one
of
the
first
big
one
be
to
the
san
francisco
commonwealth
club
quite
a
conservative
group
meg
lead
the
team
that
work
on
the
speech
which
be
a
strong
defense
of
freedom
of
the
press
i
be
in
something
of
a
panic
about
the
question
period
to
follow
the
speech
worry
that
i
would
be
quiz
on
the
minutia
of
the
watergate
story
and
not
know
all
the
player
or
the
various
event
relate
to
it
meg
give
me
a
chronology
of
the
complicate
event
that
have
be
put
together
by
the
democratic
national
committee
and
i
take
it
with
me
to
study
on
the
plane
on
the
way
out
i
settle
into
my
seat
for
the
cross
country
flight
and
begin
to
look
over
this
document
but
promptly
fell
asleep
i
woke
up
as
we
land
at
which
time
the
man
across
the
aisle
from
me
lean
over
to
say
hello
mr
graham
can
i
help
you
with
your
bag
i
look
up
into
the
eye
of
senator
dole
and
be
immediately
frozen
with
fear
that
he
have
see
me
study
the
democratic
party
prepared
document
since
this
be
not
long
after
his
accusation
that
we
be
reporting
watergate
because
i
hat
nixon
however
either
he
hadn
t
observe
it
or
else
he
be
be
polite
but
he
be
very
friendly
help
me
off
the
plane
and
do
indeed
carry
the
bag
for
me
we
talk
pleasantly
and
i
finally
work
up
my
nerve
to
say
by
the
way
senator
i
didn
t
say
i
hat
nixon
oh
you
know
he
casually
reply
during
a
campaign
they
put
these
thing
in
your
hand
and
you
just
read
them
his
reaction
amaze
me
dismiss
so
lightly
something
that
have
have
such
a
powerful
effect
on
all
of
us
at
the
post
especially
me
at
the
same
time
that
the

richard

that

that
he
have
told

more
unfair
to
the

in

its

go
ahead
and
run
the

the
way
you
want
but
don
t
be
surprised
if
the

get
a
little
upset
and
do
something
a
little
s
y
to
you
in

indeed
the
administration
be
do
something
a
little
shitty
in
return
it
be
embark
on
a
deliberate
policy
to
undermine
the
credibility
of
the
press
with
as
it
turn
out
very
good
reason
for
need
to
do
so
and
although
there
be
not
a
lot
of
concrete
evidence
we
at
the
post
be
well
aware
of

now
see
himself
as
the
self

of
the

fringe
of
arrogant
elitist
who
infect
the
healthy
mainstream
of
american

with
their
own
peculiar
view
of
the

it
be

after

about

the

it

thus
the

stridency
from

and
the
irresponsibility
of

to

coverage
the

of

receive
of
the

compare
to
that
in

two

later
in
may
nixon
himself
get
in
on

like
for

very
strict

time
and
the
washington
post
i
will
make
these
instruction
precise
and
i
want
them
carry
out
precisely
for
the
next
sixty
day
with
regard
to
the
washington

i
reaffirm
the
directive
i
give
two
week
ago
but
which

to
be
handle
as
part
of
the
general
press
corp
this
include
kilpatrick
oberdorfer
and
everybody
else
i
realize
the
argument
that
have
often
be
make
that
oberdorfer
one
time
out
of
ten
give
us
a
good
story
i
be
now
reiterate
the
policy
that
i
want
follow
out
just
treat
the
post
absolutely
coldly
all
of
their
people
be
to
be
treat
in
this
manner
if
there
be
any
exception
to
this
directive
you
be
to
raise
it
directly
with
me
and
i
will
determine
on

basis
but
under
no
circumstance
will
any
individual
on
our
staff
on
his
own
move
in
other
direction
at
the
same
time
i
want
a
policy
in
which
the
washington
star
the
washington
daily
news
the
new
york
daily
news
the
chicago
tribune
and
for
the
time
be
the
los
angeles
time
and
others
who
may
be
competitive
with
the
new
york
time
and
washington
post
continue
to
receive
special
treatment
when
ziegler
and
klein
may
determine
it
be
in
our
interest
they
will
not
agree
with
this
policy
but
it
be
one
i
have
decide
upon
after
long
consideration
and
i
want
it
carry
out
all
of
this
be
the
background
against
which
watergate
unfolded
the
pressure
on
us
up
to
that
point
however
be
nothing
to
those
that
follow
on
the
very
day
of
cbs
s
first
report
october
colson
sent
a
memo
to
another
white
house
staffer
please
check
for
me
when
any
of
the
washington
post
television
station
license
be
up
for
renewal
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
upcoming
schedule
be
coincidentally
but
luckily
for
the
administration
renewal
for
station
in
florida
be
due
in
early
january
and
these
license
as
colson
well
knew
be
a
sure
way
the
government
could
hurt
us
of
all
the
threat
to
the
company
during
watergate
the
attempt
to
undermine
our
credibility
the
petty
slight
and
the
favor
of
the
competition
the
most
effective
be
the
challenge
to
the
license
of
our
two
florida
television
station
there
be
three
separate
challenge
in
jacksonville
and
one
in
miami
all
of
which
not
coincidentally
be
file
between
december
and
january
lead
us
to
the
easy
conclusion
that
the
four
petition
must
have
be
orchestrate
out
of
more
than
thirty
station
in
the
state
of
florida
up
for
renewal
our
station
be
the
only
one
challenged
some
sort
of
record
particularly
for
station
whose
news
and
community
service
ranked
among
the
best
in
the
united
state
by
this
time
we
be
so
embattle
at
the
paper
that
i
and
most
of
us
at
the
company
view
the
challenge
as
entirely
politically
motivate
by
people
sympathetic
to
nixon
or
even
associate
with
crp
do
the
white
house
actually
encourage
or
even
originate
these
challenge
in
light
of
all
the
threat
and
memo
that
have
since
surface
it
s
easy
to
believe
that
nixon
and
his
co
conspirator
be
behind
them
but
we
never
found
a
paper
trail
lead
to
a
direct
connection
maybe
we
didn
t
have
to
so
closely
tie
be
many
of
the
prominent
figure
to
the
white
house
or
the
committee
to
reelect
the
president
no
doubt
there
be
a
mixture
of
motif
among
the
challenger
the
perception
of
blood
in
the
water
easy
picking
and
understandable
think
that
the
atmosphere
be
right
give
the
nixon
dominate
fcc
there
be
also
dissatisfaction
if
not
real
dislike
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
challenger
for
our
strong
aggressive
news
organization
especially
in
jacksonville
to
which
the
conservative
nucleus
that
ran
the
city
be
unused
we
could
see
why
some
group
didn
t
like
the
performance
of
the
two
station
both
have
played
a
not
insignificant
role
in
the
passage
of
florida
s
corporate
income
tax
and
the
florida
sunshine
law
no
doubt
too
some
of
those
in
the
challenge
group
also
misunderstood
the
complex
fcc
process
and
underestimated
the
legal
cost
involve
few
of
the
challenger
have
any
broadcasting
experience
of
course
the
group
have
ensure
that
there
be
the
require
sprinkle
of
minority
who
would
profit
mightily
from
be
give
a
few
share
in
order
to
lend
diversity
one
common
element
of
the
challenge
group
be
that
each
try
to
depict
itself
as
the
local
civic
mind
small
team
versus
the
large
out
of
state
corporation
make
the
challenger
appear
valid
in
contrast
to
the
outsider
as
we
be
brand
in
both
city
even
though
we
have
operate
in
jacksonville
for
twenty
year
and
my
husband
s
family
have
long
be
prominent
citizen
of
miami
though
there
be
plenty
of
declaration
of
a
high
mind
desire
to
bring
the
station
under
local
management
it
s
significant
that
no

just
as
the
challenge
there
have
gotten
into
full
swing
these
two
men
decide
to
meet
with
the
challenger
to
size
them
up
what
they
heard
be
vituperative
and
bitter
diatribe
much
of
it
focus
on
me
as
reflect
in
someone
s
call
me
the
dragon
lady
they
didn
t
even
know
you
norm
recall
not
one
of
them
have
met
you
but
in
their
mind
you
be
somebody
sinister
who
be
pull
the
string
much
of
my
time
and
certainly
a
great
deal
of
my
energy
and
emotional
strength
be
take
up
with
activity
in
relation
to
this
threat
and
in
listen
to
grievance
from
some
of
the
powerful
and
influential
member
of
each
community
who
threaten
to
join
the
challenger
i
flew
down
to
jacksonville
more
than
once
to
meet
with
such
people
in
an
effort
to
mollify
negative
feeling
about
the
station
since
i
want
to
do
anything
helpful
to
the
station
i
be
pleased
when
one
of
my
very
few
friend
left
in
jacksonville
a
moderate
republican
civic
leader
roger
main
call
me
he
be
the
head
of
the
st
luke
s
hospital
association
which
have
suddenly
lose
its
speaker
for
its
annual
dinner
and
to
my
astonishment
he
ask
me
for
help
in
get
attorney
general
kleindienst
to
come
to
speak
and
if
not
kleindienst
representative
gerry
ford
kleindienst
be
one
of
the
few
administration
official
who
have
always
be
reasonably
friendly
to
me
so
i
agree
to
try
and
he
accepted
roger
main
invite
me
to
the
dinner
at
the
jacksonville
civic
auditorium
and
i
accepted
with
alacrity
an
excuse
to
see
the
whole
group
the
even
be
not
an
easy
one
however
only
roger
and
another
friend
ed
lane
be
even
polite
to
me
i
somehow
get
through
the
reception
and
dinner
but
after
dinner
the
lead
light
say
good
night
to
me
and
take
kleindienst
off
to
a
party
so
i
didn
t
win
many
point
for
provide
their
speaker
the
timing
of
these
challenge
make
them
potentially
devastate
come
not
only
in
the
thick
of
watergate
but
also
just
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
pentagon
paper
and
after
we
have
go
public
more
important
fritz
have
be
work
hard
to
acquire
the
company
s
fourth
television
station
in
hartford
connecticut
we
be
naturally
concerned
that
the
traveler
insurance
company
the
seller
would
get
cold
foot
in
the
face
of
the
challenge
and
that
the
sale
wouldn
t
go
through
but
traveler
stayed
true
to
its
word
and
didn
t
hesitate
that
company
s
relationship
with
fritz
be
solid
and
the
deal
be
close
from
the
point
of
view
of
watergate
the
challenge
come
during
the
time
when
the
story
have
dry
up
after
the
election
and
we
be
sweat
about
where
the
trail
have
go
others
wonder
too
the
administration
s
power
and
anger
be
at
their
great
after
the
landslide
election
and
we
be
at
our
weak
our
public
stance
throughout
the
license
challenge
be
that
we
be
confident
of
renewal
indeed
we
have
reason
to
be
confident
at
each
station
we
have
strong
local
management
and
we
emphasize
independent
news
and
editorial
judgment
both
florida
station
have
impeccable
reputation
for
integrity
and
program
of
high
quality
we
have
met
even
exceed
all
of
the
fcc
test
for
a
good
station
one
reason
i
personally
felt
we
ought
to
be
safe
be
that
i
didn
t
see
how
the
fcc
could
take
away
our
license
without
jeopardizing
virtually
every
television
licensee
in
the
country
or
at
least
make
them
all
nervous
include
nixon
friend
and
admirer
so
well
have
we
run
these
station
but
despite
our
confidence
that
the
challenge
be
unfounded
we
be
scar
among
the
bad
effect
be
the
sharp
decline
in
our
stock
price
that
naturally
ensue
from
a
share
to
in
the
first
two
week
after
the
challenge
and
continue
on
down
to
or
decrease
the
value
of
the
company
by
more
than
half
as
for
the
direct
effect
on
our
finance
the
legal
cost
of
defend
the
license
add
up
to
well
over
a
million
dollar
in
the
two
and
a
half
year
the
entire
process
take
a
far
large
sum
then
than
now
for
a
small
company
like
ours
equally
important
be
the
erode
effect
on
the
people
try
to
run
the
station
with
these
threat
hang
over
their
head
and
in
this
hostile
atmosphere
we
try
to
reassure
them
by
tell
them
to
go
on
as
they
always
have
but
decision
be
hard
to
make
under
such
circumstance
at
neither
station
could
we
recruit
people
easily
since
there
be
concern
about
who
would
hold
the
license
in
a
few
month
time
it
be
also
difficult
to
air
the
kind
of
advocacy
editorial
we
want
to
know
they
would
be
use
against
us
the
washington
post
company
have
be
in
the
public
eye
for
several
month
certainly
more
than
i
be
comfortable
with
and
in
way
we
might
not
have
wish
we
didn
t
seek
out
the
celebrity
it
be
thrust
on
us
during
a
newsweek
sale
meeting
at
the
time
i
say
it
remind
me
somewhat
of
the
old
story
about
the
man
who
d
be
tar
and
feather
and
ridden
out
of
town
on
a
rail
when
ask
how
he
felt
he
say
except
for
the
honor
of
the
thing
i
would
rather
have
walk
by
early
i
be
grow
increasingly
anxious
and
thought
i
ought
to
meet
with
woodward
and
bernstein
in
addition
to
the
editor
surprisingly
to
this
point
seven
month
into
the
story
i
have
have
hardly
any
contact
with
the
reporter
so
on
january
bob
and
howard
and
i
sat
down
to
lunch
together
carl
be
out
of
town
characteristically
bob
go
right
downstairs
to
the
newsroom
afterwards
and
make
extensive
note
about
what
we
d
say
even
go
so
far
as
to
write
down
what
we
ate
the
main
course
be
egg
benedict
which
lead
to
our
future
reference
to
this
gathering
as
the
egg
benedict
lunch
my
apprehension
about
the
whole
watergate
affair
be
evident
be
it
all
go
to
come
out
woodward
report
that
i
ask
anxiously
i
mean
be
we
ever
go
to
know
about
all
of
this
as
bob
later
write
he
thought
it
be
the
nice
way
possible
of
ask
what
have
you
boy
be
do
with
my
newspaper
he
told
me
then
that
they
weren
t
sure
all
of
it
ever
would
come
out
depression
seem
to
register
on
her
face
never
she
ask
don
t
tell
me
never
it
be
also
at
this
lunch
that
woodward
told
me
he
have
told
no
one
the
name
of
deep
throat
tell
me
i
say
quickly
and
then
as
he
froze
i
laugh
touch
his
arm
and
say
that
i
be
only
kid
i
didn
t
want
to
carry
that
burden
around
he
admit
that
he
be
prepared
to
give
me
the
name
if
i
really
want
it
but
he
be
pray
i
wouldn
t
press
him
this
luncheon
be
reassure
for
me
or
at
least
i
give
the
appearance
of
be
reassure
but
i
remain
nervous
look
back
i
m
surprised
i
wasn
t
even
more
frighten
the
period
lead
up
to
the
trial
of
the
watergate
seven
which
begin
on
january
have
be
extremely
tense
colson
be
talk
around
washington
about
go
to
our
national
advertiser
or
our
investor
a
wall
street
friend
of
mine
andr
meyer
a
man
with
administration
contact
call
me
and
ask
me
to
come
to
see
him
when
i
do
he
advise
me
to
be
very
careful
of
everything
i
do
or
say
and
just
like
in
the
movie
he
warn
me
not
to
be
alone
oh
andr
i
say
that
s
really
absurdly
melodramatic
nothing
will
happen
to
me
i
m
serious
he
say
i
ve
talk
to
them
and
i
m
tell
you
not
to
be
alone
andr
never
explain
what
his
fear
be
base
on
and
i
still
have
no
idea
what
he
have
heard
or
even
meant
but
i
certainly
get
the
point
about
how
serious
he
be
i
lay
awake
many
night
worry
though
not
about
my
personal
safety
beyond
its
reputation
the
very
existence
of
the
post
be
at
stake
i
d
live
with
white
house
anger
before
but
i
have
never
see
anything
remotely
like
the
kind
of
fury
and
heat
i
be
feel
target
at
us
now
it
seem
at
time
that
we
should
really
be
worry
about
some
bizarre
kafkaesque
plot
that
maybe
we
be
be
lead
down
a
road
to
discredit
the
paper
the
moment
of
anxiety
increase
in
quantity
and
intensity
naturally
we
be
worried
when
our
story
be
deny
repeatedly
and
vehemently
even
we
it
seem
underestimated
for
a
long
time
the
capacity
of
government
to
hide
and
distort
the
truth
finally
a
series
of
event
begin
to
unfold
in
our
favor
three
day
after
the
begin
of
the

that

in
fact

have
urge
the
burglar
to
plead
guilty
and
go

of

of

and
out
get
our
gal

a
picture

every
newspaper
in
the
world
there
might
be
a
revolution
at
some
point
woodward
have
met
with
deep
throat
who
told
him
that
the
subpoena
be
part
of
a
response
induced
by
nixon
s
rampage
against
the
post
and
that
he
nixon
would
use
the
million
left
over
from
his
campaign
to
take
the
post
down
a
notch
it
will
be
wear
on
you
but
the
end
be
in
sight
deep
throat
told
woodward
in
the
end
the
subpoena
be
quashed
but
not
before
we
have
spent
a
great
deal
of

equally
crucial

i
be
on
a
trip
to
the
far
east
in

of

when
an
important
call
reach
me
in
hong
kong
howard
simon
be
phone
to
tell
me
the
stun
news
that
james

have
write
a
letter
to
judge
sirica
charge
that
perjury
be
commit
at
the
watergate
trial
that
the
defendant
have
be
pressure
to
plead
guilty
and
keep
quiet
that
high
ups
be
indeed
involve
and
that
several
member
of
my
family
have
express
fear
for
my
life
if
i
disclose
knowledge
of
the
fact
in
this
matter
mccord
agree
to
tell
what
he
knew
about
the
original
burglary
in
exchange
for
a
more
lenient
sentence
what
a
relief
or
as
ben
would
later
write
bingo
this
be
the
first
real
break
in
the
case
and
in
the
story
alter
the
reporting
of
the
watergate
scandal
from
that
point
on
as
well
as
change
the
nature
of
reporting
for
the
future
mccord
s
letter
confirm
our
story
make
what
we
d
say
sound
much
more
plausible
and
change
the
image
of
the
paper
as
well
as
my
own
image
in
some
way
suddenly
people
realize
there
be
proof
to
back
up
our
reporting
there
be
evidence
that
what
we
have
be
say
be
true
we
have
be
through
many
long
month
of
hang
out
there
and
now
the
press
appear
in
drove
finally
lift
the
rug
to
look
for
lead
pile
on
begin
the
post
be
no
longer
alone
although
we
be
still
out
front
we
begin
to
get
more
competition
in
reporting
the
story
both
from
other
paper
and
from
the
newsmagazines
include
newsweek
which
start
to
do
cover
after
cover
so
much
that
follow
stem
from
mccord
s
letter
our
increase
visibility
my
high
profile
more
request
for
speech
and
interview
all
of
this
surprised
me
at
the
time
and
worried
me
later
because
i
be
still
on
the
asian
trip
when
mccord
s
letter
become
public
mine
be
a
baptism
by
fire
with
interview
request
pour
in
from
news
medium
all
over
the
far
east
but
since
the
aim
of
the
trip
be
to
promote
newsweek
international
i
welcome
the
increase
opportunity
to
speak
out
by
the
time
i
return
from
the
trip
at
the
end
of
march
the
situation
for
the
administration
have
start
to
unravel
henry
kissinger
recall
that
it
be
shortly
after
this
that
he
begin
to
realize
watergate
be
real
and
be
not
go
to
go
away
have
be
unable
to
fathom
that
our
reporting
might
be
accurate
henry
have
worried
mostly
about
the
effect
of
watergate
on
the
development
of
our
foreign
policy
and
on
the
administration
s
freedom
of
maneuver
in
conduct
it
early
on
he
have
have
lunch
with
joe
califano
and
have
ask
what
be
you
democrat
go
to
do
now
to
which
joe
reply
we
re
go
to
get
well
on
watergate
henry
then
go
to
either
haldeman
or
ehrlichman
and
say
what
s
he
talk
about
the
response
it
s
wishful
think
but
a
great
deal
be
go
on
behind
the
scene
at
the
white
house
and
several
resignation
be
announce
on
april
along
with
john
dean
s
fire
as
counsel
elliot
richardson
the
new
attorney
general
be
give
the
right
to
appoint
a
special
prosecutor
nixon
come
on
television
at
p
m
that
night
there
weren
t
many
television
in
the
newsroom
so
several
of
us
include
woodward
and
bernstein
crowd
into
howard
simon
s
office
to
watch
nixon
s
speech
it
be
one
of
those
many
time
throughout
watergate
when
i
just
want
to
be
at
the
paper
with
friend
and
in
the
thick
of
thing
bernstein
and
woodward
who
write
everything
down
even
report
that
when
nixon
come
on
seat
at
his
desk
with
a
picture
of
his
family
on
one
side
and
a
bust
of
lincoln
on
the
other
i
say
oh
my
god
this
be
too
much
nixon
in
his
speech
accepted
the
responsibility
but
not
the
blame
for
watergate
he
resort
to
his
old
formula
the
easy
course
would
be
for
me
to
blame
those
to
whom
i
delegate
the
responsibility
to
run
the
campaign
but
that
would
be
a
cowardly
thing
to
do
it
be
the
system
that
have
brought
the
fact
to
life
a
system
that
in
this
case
have
include
a
determine
grand
jury
honest
prosecutor
a
courageous
judge
judge
sirica
and
a
vigorous
free
press
after
the
televise
address
he
gratuitously
stop
by
the
white
house
pressroom
and
say
we
ve
have
our
difference
in
the
past
and
just
continue
to
give
me
hell
when
you
think
i
m
wrong
all
of
this
create
a
huge
stir
in
the
newsroom
howard
simon
say
to
staff
member
we
can
t
afford
to
gloat
a
sentiment
that
i
share
though
watergate
be
no
longer
a
lonely
project
for
the
post
we
be
proud
of
the
part
we
have
played
but
it
be
now
on
its
way
to
become
a
national
tragedy
and
we
have
no
impulse
to
flaunt
our
role
though
every
reason
to
feel
relief
at
vindication
chapter
twenty
four
in
the
middle
of
the
bad

announce
that
the

point
out
that
it
would
hardly
make
sense
for
the

not
to
be
recognize
for
its
watergate
coverage
we
have
enter
the
competition
in
the
category
of
public
service
but
have
not
won
or
seemingly
come
close
largely
because
the
regional
editor
on
the
prize
committee
be
so
incredulous
about
the
whole
affair
after
scotty
and
newby
voiced
their
opinion
the
board
ask
ben
whether
he
want
the

they
have
already
vote
on
with
only
david

retain
his

but
despite
nixon
s
dramatic
speech
and
the
win
of
the
pulitzer
with
its
attendant
confirmation
of
our
reporting
the
whole
watergate
affair
be
far
from
over
some
of
the
rejoice
have
be
premature
although
we
have
gain
credibility
when
haldeman
and
ehrlichman
resign
we
still
have
an
implacable
enemy
in
the
white
house
albeit
a
weaken
one
much
of
the
world
remain
with
nixon
and
continued
to
think
that
the
whole
affair
have
be
vastly
exaggerated
some
of
the
world
still
do
many
foreigner
fail
to
grasp
the
significance
of
watergate
particularly
in
europe
and
in
the
arab
world
where
people
view
the
president
as
a
foreign
policy
genius
which
in
many
way
he
be
there
be
a
lot
we
and
the
public
still
didn
t
know
but
we
be
on
the
road
to
find
out
help
along
in
the
spring
of
by
a
federal
grand
jury
s
indictment
of
former
attorney
general
john
mitchell
and
former

on

to

campaign
the
televise
senate
watergate
hearing
and
early
call
for
impeachment
come
from
conservative
include
barry
goldwater
as
much
as
or
more
than
from
liberal
also
help
the
continue
effort
of
the
post
and
finally
other
newspaper
and
other
medium
as
well
and
the
congress
and
the
court
help
expose
the
size
of
the
iceberg
there
begin
a
steady
stream
of
revelation
with
more
and
more
evidence
of
scheme
and
political
chicanery
come
to
light
wiretap
of
several
journalist
be
reveal
we
be
told
by
many
people
that
the
post
s
building
be
bug
and
even
that
i
be
be
follow
some
of
this
be
clearly
an
overreaction
in
an
environment
rife
with
paranoia
we
do
a
sweep
of
our
phone
throughout
the
building
and
in
my
office
and
the
office
of
key
editor
but
turn
up
nothing
i
m
fairly
sure
that
my
phone
be
never
tapped
nor
do
i
believe
i
be
ever
follow
but
the
atmosphere
be
so
infect
that
this
kind
of
suspicion
didn
t
seem
irrational
at
all
in
june
woodward
and
bernstein
write
that
the
white
house
have
maintain
a
list
of
political
enemy
in
and
and
the
disclosure
surprised
few
of
us
by
that
time
many
people
several
of
my
friend
among
them
regard
it
as
an
honor
to
be
on
it
the
list
be
yet
another
sign
of
the
peculiar
mentality
of
the
small
group
of
men
run
the
country
i
can
t
remember
whether
my
name
actually
appear
on
it
but
it
be
clear
to
me
that
i
be
on
it
whether
my
name
be
write
down
or
not
a
month
later
a
seismic
watergate
event
occur
the
turn
point
the
pivotal
moment
in
the
course
of
his
testimony
before
the
senate
investigate
committee
alexander
butterfield
another
haldeman
aide
reveal
that
there
be
a
voice
activate
record
system
in
the
white
house
consequently
the
vast
majority
of
conversation
the
president
have
have
in
the
oval
office
be
on
tape
a
fact
the
president
himself
have
clearly
lose
sight
of
or
perhaps
he
assume
that
no
one
knew
and
that
therefore
the
existence
of
the
system
would
never
become
public
knowledge
however
someone
have
to
have
instal
this
thing
as
well
as
run
it
and
that
someone
be
alexander
butterfield
as
woodward
later
say
it
be
yet
another
incredible
sequence
of
event
and
luck
for
us
and
bad
luck
for
nixon
wrong
decision
wrong
turn
but
full
disclosure
of
it
hung
by
that
fragile
thread
that
could
have
be
cut
hundred
of
time
without
the
tape
the
true
story
would
never
have
emerge
in
fact
i
believe
that
we
at
the
post
be
really
save
in
the
end
by
the
tape
and
the
lucky
chance
that
they
weren
t
destroyed
after
the
discovery
of
the
tape
people
actually
begin
wait
in
the
alley
outside
our
building
for
the
first
edition
of
the
paper
give
additional
meaning
to
the
phrase
hot
off
the
press
everyone
be
now
follow
the
story
who
know
why
nixon
didn
t
destroy
the
tape
he
seem
to
think
that
they
be
valuable
and
that
he
could
defend
their
privacy
which
for
a
long
time
he
try
to
do
on
july
the
president
announce
he
would
not
release
the
tape
to
special
prosecutor
archibald
cox
who
have
be
appoint
by
attorney
general
elliot
richardson
because
it
would
jeopardize
the
independence
of
the
three
branch
of
government
unaccountably
during
this
time
i
be
still
attempt
to
maintain
relation
even
with
vice
president
spiro
agnew
which
in
retrospect
seem
to
me
undignified
consider
the
awful
slam
we
be
take
from
him
i
think
my
behavior
be
a
combination
of
a
rational
idea
that
it
be
well
to
be
talk
to
people
who
hat
us
or
disapprove
of
us
than
not
and
that
good
old
fashion
encumbrance
of
mine
the
desire
to
please
someone
have
sent
me
a
funny
photograph
of
an
old
shed
somewhere
in
new
york
on
which
have
be
paint
ted
agnew
like
kay
graham
pas
it
on
i
thought
it
be
hilarious
and
do
just
that
pass
it
on
to
the
vice
president
say
i
thought
this
sign
might
amuse
you
as
it
do
me
the
man
who
sent
me
the
snapshot
of
the
graffiti
told
me
that
the
shed
later
burn
thus
destroy
the
evidence
i
guess
thing
in
life
or
in
graffiti
often
come
full
circle
i
promise
to
keep
it
a
secret
even
more
peculiarly
agnew
write
back
i
can
find
no
fault
with
the
sentiment
of
the
graffiti
it
be
difficult
to
admire
a
newspaper
that
characterizes
one
as
caligula
s
horse
but
i
think
you
be
charm
how
embarrass
a
separate
drama
begin
unfold
around
agnew
only
ten
day
after
i
have
write
him
the
snivel
little
note
agnew
announce
that
he
have
be
inform
he
be
under
investigation
for
possible
violation
of
criminal
law
and
two
day
later
on
august
he
held
a
press
conference
to
trot
out
the
usual
denial
of
wrongdoing
as
the
investigation
continued
the
post
on
september
write
that
despite
his
statement
that
he
would
never
quit
the
vice
president
be
plea
bargaining
agnew
s
lawyer
try
to
learn
the
source
of
certain
damage
leak
by
issue
subpoena
to
post
reporter
richard
cohen
and
others
who
have
be
run
story
about
him
i
later
use
quite
plain
language
to
describe
what
agnew
be
try
to
do
freed
of
legalese
he
want
to
know
who
in
government
be
finger
him
so
he
could
deal
with
them
personally
or
have
the
president
fire
them
the
strategy
our
lawyer
work
out
to
protect
cohen
and
the
paper
be
to
put
all
of
his
note
relate
to
agnew
in
my
possession
and
in
my
affidavit
to
the
court
i
assert
that
i
have
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
custody
of
the
note
in
fact
i
be
prepared
to
go
to
jail
if
need
be
to
defend
the
note
and
the
source
this
time
the
possibility
of
jail
seem
more
realistic
i
be
travel
and
call
between
plane
to
hear
with
relief
that
agnew
have
plead
no
contest
to
one
count
of
income
tax
evasion
while
governor
of
maryland
which
meant
that
i
be
off
the
hook
on
october
spiro
t
agnew
resign
as
vice
president
meanwhile
president
nixon
s
trouble
continued
to
mount
not
help
at
all
by
the
agnew
crisis
on
august
he
have
make
another
televise
speech
deliver
his
fifth
major
statement
on
watergate
call
it
a
backward
look
obsession
and
try
to
deflect
interest
away
from
it
by
suggest
that
the
nation
let
the
court
deal
with
it
and
turn
its
attention
instead
to
matter
of
far
great
importance
a
week
after
that
on
august
the
same
day
nixon
make
kissinger
secretary
of
state
follow
the
resignation
of
bill

also
accepted
the

when

of
appeal
for
the
district
of
columbia

sirica
nixon
then
come
up
with
the
peculiar
idea
of
provide
tape
to
the
federal
court
and
senate
investigator
with
a
personally
prepared
summary
to

his
decision
not
to

with
the

of

to
and

by
that
point
every
journalist
have
left
art
s
party
to
head
back
to
work
so
dramatic
and
unexpected
be
the
event
that
night
that
we
be
all
really
shaken
it
s
hard
to
realize
now
how
fast
everything
be
unfold
with
leon
jaworski
succeed
cox
as
special
prosecutor
the
house
judiciary
committee
met
to

eventually
the
many
impeachment
resolution
that
be
introduce
in
the
house
of
representative
seem
to
induce
the
president
to
release
the
tape
cox
have
insist
on
yet
the
post
remain
under
attack
and
the
attack
be
become
much
more
public
by
this
time
i
have
warm
up
to
a
degree
of
toughness
of
which
i
probably
wouldn
t
have
be
capable
the
year
before
i
be
not
a
good
combatant
generally
i
hate
fight
and
would
like
to
run
from
them
but
when
there
be
no
choice
i
feel
able
to
take
action
i
be
much
more
willing
to
go
on
the
offensive
than
to
be
defensively
polite
particularly
in
my
letter
to
reader
and
others
who
write
complain
about
our
coverage
for
example
whereas
earlier
i
may
have
be
somewhat
sympathetic
with
reader
who
write
about
the
sharpness
of
herblock
s
pen
in
the
later
stage
of
watergate
i
have
no
patience
with
those
who
complain
that
he
be
be
unfair
to
the
president
to
one
scathing
letter
i
respond
we
have
be
heavily
attack
for
bias
reporting
by
many
individual
who
when
confront
with
the
fact
have
since
resign
from
the
government
i
write
to
a
man
in
florida

october
facetiously
thank
him
for
send
me
a
copy
of
an
ad
from
the
miami
paper
suggest
that
we
belong
in
jail
and
ask
him
if
we
be
exaggerate
minor
peccadillo
why
have
the
majority
of
the
white
house
staff
have
to
be
unloaded
at
some
point
i
even
engage
in
a
behind

scene
back
and
forth
with
clare
booth
luce
personally
i
admire
her
but
i
be
not
in
accord
with
her
extremely
conservative
view
she
sometimes
overdramatize
thing
in
speech
in
a
major
address
to
the
newspaper
publisher
association
convention
she
say
she
have
write
a
speech
but
be
troubled
about
it
and
think
about
it
as

night

the
spirit
of
her
late

the
president
spent
a
great
deal
of
time

recall
sit
on
the
stair
in
a
dark
narrow
passageway
where
the
phone
be
locate
furiously
scribble
note
on
a
scrap
of
paper

the
opposite
of
what
we

of
strain
worry

anguish
by
this

voice
have
you
heard
the
late
and
then
proceed
to
tell
me
of
the
backdating
of
the
deed
for
the
paper
nixon
have
give
as
a
gift
to
the
national
archive
for
the
propose
nixon
library
the
deed
have
be
falsely
backdate
to
before
the
effective
date
of
a
law
curb
tax
deduction
for
such
gift
nixon
have
claimed
deduction
of
nearly
half
a
million
dollar
over
four
year
i
also
remember
that
my
reaction
then
be
how
wonderful
i
realize
that
sound
vindictive
but
the
fact
be
that
after
we
have
be
under
assault
for
so
long
it
naturally
felt
good
to
have
such
revelation
unfold
one
after
another
far
beyond
our
reporting
or
even
our
wild
imaginings
meg
say
the
next
time
you
make
one
of
your
speech
say
this
certainly
give
us
no
satisfaction
we
be
only
do
our
bounden
duty
god
will
strike
you
dead
again
we
be
happy
to
have
everything
corroborate
far
when
on
march
indictment
be
hand
down
by
a
grand
jury
for
seven
former
nixon
administration
and
campaign
official
for
allegedly
conspire
to
cover
up
the
watergate
burglary
what
next
on
may
the
house
judiciary
committee
begin
formal
hearing
on
the
possible
impeachment
of
nixon
though
some
of
my
friend
include
andr
meyer
suggest
that
the
post
be
try
to
extract
every
last
drop
of
blood
from
the
president
i
believe
that
we
be
follow
and
reporting
the
impeachment
process
in
a
reason
and
dispassionate
way
and
reply
to
andr
i
hardly
see
how
anyone
no
matter
how
ill
intentioned
could
pervert
this
to
extract
every
last
drop
of
blood
it
really
have
more
to
do
with
what
be
best
for
the
country
now
and
in
the
future
than
it
have
to
do
with
this
president
who
no
longer
matter
whereas
the
country
do
privately
i
felt
that
impeachment
be
right
but
my
personal
opinion
didn
t
get
mixed
up
in
the
paper
s
ongoing
reporting
in
mid
may
it
be
reveal
that
nixon
s
talk
with
haldeman
and
dean
about
economic
retaliation
against
the
washington
post
company
s
television
station
license
have
be
cut
from
the
tape
before
its
release
this
be
widely
report
in
the
paper
include
our
own
as
a
result
i
receive
a
contrite
letter
from
joe
alsop
who
on
the
whole
have
continued
to
stick
by
the
president
and
with
whom
i
have
have
a
serious
argument
about
whether
the
administration
be
connect
to
the
license
challenge
joe
write
me
you
re
dead
right
and
i
be
nearly
dead
wrong
this
be
my
first
reaction
to
the
extraordinarily
interest
story
by
bernstein
and
woodward
on
the
president
s
threat
of
retaliation
against
the
post
i
cannot
tell
you
how
much
i
admire
the
enormous
courage
that
you
have
all
show
particularly
you
and
ben
whether
the
final
outcome
will
be
happy
i
cannot
possibly
say
and
i
sometimes
have
my
doubt
but
the
fact
be
that
a
very
dangerous
system
have
grown
up
in
the
white
house
which
would
have
threaten
this
country
if
it
have
continued
it
be
destroyed
by
you
and
the
other
leader
of
the
post
and
the
post
reporter
almost
single
hand
so
i
send
you
all
my
warm
congratulation
and
also
my
apology
for
give
our
miserable
president
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
which
now
turn
out
to
be
a
completely
wrong
thing
to
do
it
be
a
generous
letter
from
joe
one
i
m
sure
he
write
with
a
great
deal
of
sadness
and
lamentation
for
something
irretrievably
lose
watergate
continued
on
its
way
toward
an
end
none
of
us
could
have
imagine
two
year
earlier
even
as
late
as
the
summer
of
amaze
as
it
may
seem
after
all
that
have
be
reveal
and
all
the
constitutional
process
that
have
take
place
the
grand
jury
the
court
the
congressional
committee
nixon
be
still
blame
the
press
for
his
predicament
say
at
one
point
that
if
he
have
be
a
liberal
and
bug
out
of
vietnam
the
press
would
never
have
played
up
watergate
despite
nixon
s
protestation
to
his
supporter
rabbi
baruch
korff
that
watergate
would
be
remember
as
the
broad
but
thinnest
scandal
in
american
history
it
go
on
be
reveal
as
anything
but
on
july
the
united
state
supreme
court
heard
argument
in
a
historic
special
session
in
the
case
of
the
united
state
v
richard
m
nixon
what
be
at
stake
be
whether
the
court
would
order
the
release
of
the
white
house
tape
the
next
day
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
peter
rodino
divulge
many
of
the
difference
between
what
the
white
house
have
release
and
what
the
committee
have
found
on
certain
tape
indicate
that
nixon
have
played
an
active
role
in
the
cover
up
which
be
still
go
on
on
july
event
move
inexorably
forward
as
the
supreme
court
rule
unanimously
that
nixon
have
no
right
to
withhold
evidence
in
criminal
proceeding
and
order
him
to
turn
over
the
additional
white
house
tape
that
have
be
subpoenaed
by
jaworski
on
july
and
respectively
the
house
judiciary
committee
adopt
three
article
of
impeachment
charge
president
nixon
with
obstruction
of
justice
failure
to
uphold
law
and
refusal
to
produce
material
subpoenaed
by
the
committee
editorially
the
post
do
not
come
out
for
resignation
as
many
other
paper
do
we
believe
as
an
independent
paper
that
people
would
behave
wisely
and
judiciously
if
give
the
information
necessary
to
make
their
decision
and
that
the
process
should
be
allow
to
work
finally
on
august
the
long
anticipate
smoking
gun
turn
up
three
new
transcript
be
release
by
the
white
house
recount
conversation
between
nixon
and
haldeman
on
june
six
day
after
the
original
breakin
the
tape
show
that
the
president
have
personally
order
a
cover
up
and
that
he
have
direct
effort
to
hide
the
involvement
of
his
aide
in
the
breakin
through
a
series
of
order
to
conceal
detail
about
it
know
to
himself
but
not
to
the
fbi
this
be
such
a
dramatic
and
obviously
final
development
that
i
left
martha
s
vineyard
where
i
have
go
for
my
august
vacation
and
flew
immediately
to
washington
nixon
initially
say
that
he
would
not
resign
that
he
believe
the
constitutional
process
should
be
allow
to
run
its
course
all
ten
republican
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
who
have
vote
against
impeachment
then
announce
they
would
vote
in
favor
of
at
least
the
obstruction
of
justice
article
we
lead
the
paper
with
the
possibility
of
nixon
s
resignation
but
make
no
prediction
despite
speculation
on
every
side
on
august
president
nixon
announce
that
he
would
resign
the
next
day
i
stayed
at
the
paper
all
that
day
together
many
of
us
watch
nixon
s
television
appearance
about
his
decision
to
resign
phil
geyelin
have
dinner
at
the
madison
hotel
across
the
street
from
our
office
and
write
on
a
napkin
a
rough
draft
of
an
editorial
on
the
resignation
when
it
be
typed
he
sent
it
to
me
with
a
note
this
be
one
you
probably
would
want
to
take
a
look
at
on
august
the
post
produce
a
twenty
two
page
special
section
on
the
nixon
year
along
with
a
few
people
in
my
office
i
watch
the
weird
speech
nixon
make
before
leave
the
white
house
fairly
incoherently
talk
to
his
staff
in
the
east
room
about
his
mother
who
seem
to
be
on
his
mind
a
great
deal
the
unreality
of
the
whole
thing
hung
all
around
us
after
the
long
month
that
have
stretch
into
year
it
be
so
strange
to
be
watch
what
none
of
us
have
ever
imagine
happen
it
all
seem
both
world
shatter
and
confuse
a
miracle
of
sort
have
take
place
this
country
be
about
to
change
president
in
an
utterly
democratic
way
with
the
process
that
have
be
put
into
place
two
century
before
work
in
this
unprecedented
situation
at
the
post
we
receive
a
lot
of
unpleasant
phone
call
many
reader
express
the
sentiment
that
they
imagine
we
be
all
pop
champagne
cork
to
celebrate
the
result
we
have
want
from
the
begin
in
short
the
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
school
of
thought
what
i
mostly
felt
be
relief
mingle
with
anxiety
until
the
smoking
gun
tape
have
turn
up
nothing
have
be
certain
right
up
to
the
last
few
day
of
his
presidency
it
seem
possible
that
nixon
could
hold
on
now
the
unease
about
where
all
of
it
be
lead
be
over
immediately
after
watch
nixon
s
speech
and
before
he
d
left
washington
i
return
to
the
vineyard
to
continue
my
vacation
when
i
get
back
to
the
quiet
of
my
house
there
on
the
island
that
always
give
me
a
sense
of
peace
and
remoteness
from
everyday
life
i
turn
on
the
television
and
heard
a
voice
refer
to
president
ford
it
be
quite
shake
then
and
only
then
do
i
experience
pure
relief
i
actually
felt
a
weight
leave
my
shoulder
it
be
over
nixon
be
go
ford
be
president
and
indeed
our
long
national
nightmare
be
over
the
relief
come
from
have
a
nice
open
honest
and
nonthreatening
president
one
of
the
final
touch
to
watergate
occur
just
after
nixon
have
left
washington
bob
woodward
come
to
my
office
with
the
most
wonderful
present
an
old
fashion
wooden
laundry
wringer
it
be
sign
by
the
six
men
who
have
work
throughout
those
year
to
keep
the
story
alive
ben
and
howard
bob
and
carl
harry
rosenfeld
and
barry
sussman
i
love
have
this
symbol
so
indicative
of
the
pressure
we
have
felt
during
watergate
an
antique
dealer
have
call
bob
to
say
he
would
be
willing
to
sell
the
old
wringer
in
case
he
want
to
consider
give
it
to
me
ever
cautious
bob
have
ask
how
much
ten
the
man
reply
ten
what
bob
ask
ten
dollar
come
the
answer
bob
snap
up
the
deal
and
i
receive
the
much
cherished
wooden
wringer
that
sits
in
my
office
still
over
twenty
year
later
when
i
return
to
washington
in
september
i
thought
life
might
finally
get
back
to
normal
after
two
solid
year
of
constant
stress
over
watergate
little
do
i
realize
that
the
normal
i
be
think
of
have
wholly
change
what
i
want
be
to
be
out
of
the
limelight
and
i
want
the
paper
to
be
out
of
it
too
but
that
be
far
from
what
happen
to
begin
with
we
still
have
the
challenge
to
our
station
hang
over
our
head
the
denouement
finally
come
at
the
end
of
the
miami
challenge
be
withdrawn
november
and
one
of
the
jacksonville
one
in
january
the
other
two
be
deny
by
the
fcc
in
april
and
july
the
judge
ruling
that
because
of
overt
deception
practice
in
the
filing
of
the
st
john
s
application
no
find
could
be
make
that
the
grant
of
its
application
would
be
in
the
public
interest
again
we
be
fortunate
that
the
challenger
seem
so
sure
of
win
through
their
political
connection
that
they
really
never
make
any
kind
of
a
case
more
even
than
nixon
s
resignation
this
be
the
end
of
watergate
for
us
by
then
we
have
be
fight
this
battle
against
venality
for
two
year
in
the
case
of
two
of
the
challenge
and
two
and
a
half
in
the
latter
two
we
have
paid
a
heavy
price
not
only
in
money
but
in
concern
distraction
and
erosion
on
december
both
ben
and
i
be
invite
to
a
dinner
at
the
ford
white
house
where
i
be
seat
at
the
table
with
the
new
president
an
excite
symbol
that
the
whole
sad
affair
of
watergate
be
over
an
amuse
sidelight
on
ford
s
elevation
to
the
presidency
come
when
tee
shirt
be
print
with
his
picture
on
them
together
with
the
caption
i
get
my
job
through
the
washington
post
a
slogan
also
use
by
our
classify
ad
department
by
then
ford
have
grant
a
full
free
and
absolute
pardon
to
nixon
which
i
thought
premature
believe
that
he
should
have
extract
at
least
some
sort
of
admission
of
guilt
for
it
i
suspect
that
more
awful
deed
lurk
unexposed
now
likely
never
to
surface
i
m
sure
ford
be
under
a
lot
of
pressure
to
get
the
whole
disastrous
affair
behind
us
but
nixon
s
associate
paid
an
even
high
price
than
he
do
resign
the
presidency
be
a
high
price
indeed
but
his
associate
mostly
go
to
jail
whereas
he
be
able
eventually
to
work
his
way
back
into
be
some
sort
of
elder
statesman
even
contribute
to
think
about
foreign
policy
in
the
presidency
of
ronald
reagan
and
george
bush
by
the
end
of
we
the
paper
and
certain
individual
on
it
begin
to
get
a
number
of
award
as
i
write
someone
it
be
a
happy
problem
i
picked
up
two
of
the
big
press
award
the
john
peter
zenger
and
the
elijah
parish
lovejoy
i
think
some
of
these
award
should
have
go
to
others
particularly
ben
which
i
believe
didn
t
happen
because
a
kind
of
reverse
sexism
be
at
work
fortunately
who
get
what
award
didn
t
cause
any
kind
of
problem
in
ben
s
and
my
relationship
in
fact
when
early
in
a
medium
industry
newsletter
name
me
outstanding
newspaper
executive
with
ben
as
runner
up
i
found
it
especially
ironic
since
i
be
still
have
nothing
but
travail
as
a
newspaper
executive
i
realize
however
that
watergate
be
on
everybody
s
mind
at
the
time
and
the
editor
of
that
report
didn
t
look
at
the
overall
picture
in
fact
my
relationship
with
ben
be
solidify
forever
by
watergate
i
rely
heavily
on
him
throughout
more
than
ever
he
be
the
gung
ho
charismatic
leader
remain
cool
and
courageous
no
matter
what
we
be
hit
with
as
woodward
later
say
there
be
always
a
sense
that
bradlee
s
our
leader
he
s
the
guy
who
s
plant
the
flag
ben
s
personality
be
and
be
so
up
that
i
would
go
to
see
him
sometimes
just
because
a
visit
be
reassure
in
addition
i
almost
always
learn
something
new
from
him
rumor
swirl
around
us
that
i
be
go
to
get
rid
of
him
that
he
have
go
too
far
in
reporting
watergate
when
this
kind
of
rumor
circulates
denial
win
you
nothing
the
rumor
get
recycle
even
though
the
person
stay
on
and
on
there
be
also
numerous
sexist
comment
on
our
relationship
somehow
it
always
seem
to
be
depict
in
exaggerated
way
for
example
i
write
tom
winship
after
a
piece
have
appear
in
the
boston
globe
on
ben
bradlee
and
abe
rosenthal
complain
w
hy
be
it
if
a
female
publisher
and
a
male
editor
get
along
he
be
accuse
of
stroke
and
she
of
be
susceptible
to
manipulation
the
fact
be
i
always
love
work
with
ben
and
this
period
even
with
its
many
strain
be
probably
the
most
reward
time
of
all
in
keep
with
our
establish
tradition
of
write
each
other
end
of
the
year
letter
i
write
to
ben
at
the
end
of
that
momentous
year
of
this
letter
sum
up
many
of
my
innermost
feeling
about
what
we
d
be
through
together
this
year
i
m
not
go
to
wait
for
yours
because
i
begin
to
think
while
dress
about
the
past
year
and
by
the
time
i
get
to
my
shoe
i
have
to
grab
the
pad
and
begin
as
i
thought
of
your
remark
yesterday
afternoon
that
it
be
that
time
of
year
the
first
thing
you
and
i
have
to
do
be
separate
myth
from
reality
because
after
this
year
the
myth
will
start
to
grow
and
reality
will
start
to
diminish
even
in
our
mind
the
reality
be
so
much
less
pretentious
but
so
apparently
impossible
to
describe
and
it
really
be
much
nicer
because
it
s
human
you
be
now
suppose
to
be
a
hero
and
i
a
heroine
by
many
and
the
opposite
by
many
i
think
hero
and
heroine
be
both
vulgar
and
boring
and
usually
lead
that
kind
of
life
but
when
you
tell
people
you
be
just
do
your
own
thing
in
an
admittedly
escalate
situation
they
say
ah
yes
etc
so
what
be
the
reality
they
be
so
complicate
of
course
because
we
have
know
each
other
and
our
life
have
impinge
on
each
other
with
almost
proustian
coincidence
both
closer
and
more
distant
than
they
d
think
closer
because
i
be
think
of
the
share
walter
and
helen
lippmann
type
memory
the
first
tour
at
the
post
phil
and
me
see
you
and
jean
in
paris
lead
up
obviously
to
the
drama
of
newsweek
follow
by
the
horror
year
view
so
differently
at
the
time
and
then
phil
s
death
you
have
to
remember
at
that
time
we
hardly
knew
each
other
and
certainly
not
in
reality
or
very
favorably
either
how
could
the
rest
have
happen
it
couldn
t
ever
again
we
be
still
small
enough
as
a
company
still
private
and
so
the
impossible
happen
i
with
nothing
more
than
a
family
feel
a
passion
for
newspaper
and
this
newspaper
in
particular
not
the
slightest
clue
about
business
broadcasting
or
newsweek
only
negative
vibe
about
the
latter
which
be
associate
only
with
madness
in
my
mind
take
over
this
peculiar
and
charismatic
entity
two
year
later
you
knock
typically
brashly
intuitively
humorously
rudely
perceptively
farsightedly
ballsily
and
pushy
as
hell
and
because
this
be
a
not
unfamiliar
syndrome
to
me
and
one
whose
merit
and
drawback
i
knew
i
nod
a
feeble
assent
i
guess
that
s
slightly
exaggerated
i
say
hastily
for
all
those
future
fuck
columbia
journalism
review
story
but
there
s
a
kind
of
core
truth
to
the
scene
then
come
another
the
year
of
learn
of
stumble
of
fun
of
some
achievement
progress
mixed
with
big
smelly
egg
on
the
floor
laid
and
clean
up
or
just
shove
under
the
rug
until
the
stain
soak
through
the
fascinate
thing
and
the
thing
to
remember
be
that
if
you
have
enough
go
for
you
in
the
way
of
momentum
and
luck
everyone
look
at
the
develop
pattern
on
the
rug
whether
it
s
an
oriental
design
or
the
stain
from
the
egg
and
say
what
a
beautiful
rug
and
pretty
soon
we
re
tell
ourselves
it
s
a
hell
of
a
rug
we
ve
make
and
even
funnier
it
be
but
let
s
always
remember
the
stain
the
unfinished
work
with
the
total
effect
and
the
fun
my
god
the
fun
it
s
unfair
who
else
have
fun
and
that
s
my
christmas
thanks
to
you
kid
more
than
even
the
watergate
although
that
too
the
thing
that
people
don
t
know
that
i
know
be
style
generosity
class
and
decency
as
well
as
understand
of
other
people
s
weakness
it
be
out
of
all
these
many
thing
that
watergate
evolve
for
you
and
for
me
and
for
the
way
it
work
if
there
be
one
thing
i
thought
of
at
the
time
it
be
a
high
wire
over
a
canyon
in
which
i
almost
couldn
t
pull
at
your
coattail
and
say
be
we
all
right
because
if
we
re
not
look
below
it
be
sort
of
like
try
to
talk
to
the
pilot
during
a
hairy
land
not
that
i
didn
t
and
that
you
didn
t
respond
to
the
feverish
be
we
all
right
and
why
and
maybe
one
of
the
thing
it
s
easy
to
forget
in
be
that
the
answer
be
we
be
not
all
right
we
be
righteous
but
mercifully
stupid
we
be
only
save
from
extinction
by
someone
mad
enough
not
only
to
tape
himself
but
to
tape
himself
talk
about
how
to
conceal
it
well
who
could
have
count
on
that
not
you
and
not
me
thank
god
for
the
reality
it
will
never
be
in
any
book
or
any
cruddy
movie
it
s
much
too
good
for
that
ben
s
letter
to
me
at
the
end
of
that
year
conclude
we
probably
won
t
live
to
see
another
year
like
he
be
quite
right
earlier
in
the
spring
of
at
a
time
when
the
story
have
advanced
considerably
but
be
still
month
short
of
its
dramatic
conclusion
woodward
and
bernstein
have
publish
all
the
president
s
men
their
first
book
on
watergate
the
paperback
right
alone
sell
for
million
ironically
the
million
dollar
come
their
way
at
the
time
of
a
strike
by
the
newspaper
guild
i
vividly
recall
watch
a
news
broadcast
that
show
the
two
of
them
leave
the
building
with
their
file
and
i
cause
a
stir
with
a
rather
acid
remark
about
their
be
the
only
two
people
ever
to
have
make
a
million
dollar
while
on
strike
from
the
begin
there
have
be
talk
of
a
movie
once
woodward
and
bernstein
sell
the
movie
right
to
all
the
president
s
men
to
robert
redford
who
intend
to
play
bob
woodward
there
be
a
great
deal
of
fun
and
funny
speculation
both
in
the
post
s
newsroom
and
elsewhere
about
who
would
play
whom
in
the
movie
i
jokingly
told
a
group
of
circulation
manager
at
an
association
meeting
that
i
have
be
assure
by
the
editor
that
my
role
will
be
played
by
raquel
welch
assume
our
measurement
jibe
in
many
way
the
idea
of
a
movie
scar
me
witless
despite
redford
s
assurance
that
he
want
to
make
a
good
movie
about
the
first
amendment
and
freedom
of
the
press
i
be
naturally
nervous
about
have
the
image
and
reputation
of
the
post
in
the
hand
of
a
movie
company
whose
interest
do
not
necessarily
coincide
with
ours
i
couldn
t
visualize
how
he
and
his
producer
would
deal
with
as
complex
an
issue
as
press
freedom
in
a
dramatic
story
on
the
big
screen
someone
have
to
set
the
ground
rule
for
what
they
could
and
couldn
t
do
i
be
particularly
concerned
about
the
effect
of
the
movie
and
our
portrayal
in
it
on
the
political
scene
as
public
people
which
by
then
many
of
us
at
the
post
be
we
have
no
control
over
the
use
of
our
name
but
there
be
a
great
deal
of
discussion
in
the
begin
among
all
of
us
our
lawyer
include
about
whether
the
name
of
the
post
should
be
use
many
of
those
on
the
business
side
of
the
company
say
no
ben
s
argument
in
favor
of
its
use
be
one
with
which
there
be
widespread
agreement
in
the
newsroom
whatever
we
re
go
to
get
we
re
go
to
get
whether
they
call
it
the
post
or
the
bugle
to
help
calm
my
nerve
and
provide
some
assurance
that
the
producer
have
every
good
intention
bob
and
carl
brought
the
redford
to
breakfast
at
my
house
in
may
of
just
as
plan
for
the
movie
be
get
under
way
i
should
have
be
pleased
and
interested
to
meet
redford
but
we
didn
t
get
along
thanks
partially
i
m
sure
to
my
own
defensive
crouch
the
result
of
all
my
concern
however
real
or
imagine
he
knew
how
much
i
want
to
keep
a
low
profile
both
for
me
and
for
the
paper
on
the
other
hand
alan
pakula
the
director
and
i
become
great
friend
and
have
remain
so
redford
later
give
an
interview
describe
our
meeting
at
breakfast
it
be
brittle
that
s
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
she
be
gracious
but
tense
there
be
a
definite
tight
jawed
blueblood
quality
to
graham
that
cannot
be
cover
by
any
amount
of
association
with
ben
bradlee
or
other
street
type
she
say
she
do
not
want
her
own
name
or
that
of
the
post
use
i
told
her
that
be
impossible
she
be
a
public
figure
and
in
its
own
way
so
be
the
post
i
respect
her
for
not
want
her
privacy
invade
but
we
weren
t
interested
in
her
personal
life
and
i
be
puzzle
if
she
want
to
maintain
so
low
a
profile
why
do
she
keep
make
speech
and
accept
award
ben
sent
me
a
copy
of
this
acerbic
interview
to
which
i
respond
i
don
t
want
to
be
too
neurotic
but
it
reinforces
paranoia
no
he
s
get
a
point
about
my
ambivalence
which
be
and
be
real
i
be
already
worried
about
the
effect
of
the
use
of
the
post
s
name
when
i
open
a
magazine
one
day
and
read
that
the
movie
would
be
film
in
the
post
s
city
room
within
minute
i
be
on
the
phone
to
bob
woodward
to
whom
i
explode
with
outrage
at
the
idea
of
our
newsroom
as
a
backdrop
for
the
movie
among
all
the
evil
i
be
imagine
be
how
little
work
would
get
do
under
such
circumstance
bob
told
me
he
d
never
heard
me
so
angry
in
the
end
we
didn
t
allow
film
in
the
newsroom
redford
s
people
have
arrive
independently
at
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
too
disruptive
for
them
as
well
instead
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
post
s
newsroom
include
the
sticker
on
ben
s
secretary
s
desk
be
create
in
hollywood
for
a
mere
it
be
report
and
in
the
interest
of
authenticity
several
ton
of
assort
paper
and
trash
from
desk
throughout
our
newsroom
be
ship
to
california
for
prop
we
do
cooperate
to
the
extent
of
allow
the
filmmaker
to
shoot
the
entrance
to
the
newspaper
building
elevator
and
certain
production
facility
as
well
as
a
scene
in
the
parking
lot
at
one
point
i
get
a
message
from
redford
that
they
have
decide
not
to
shoot
the
one
scene
in
the
movie
in
which
i
be
to
be
portrayed
i
be
told
that
no
one
understood
the
role
of
a
publisher
and
it
be
too
extraneous
to
explain
redford
imagine
that
i
would
be
relieve
which
i
be
but
to
my
surprise
my
feeling
be
hurt
by
be
omit
altogether
except
for
the
one
famous
allusion
to
my
anatomy
the
next
i
heard
from
redford
be
a
phone
call
say
he
be
send
a
preliminary
print
of
the
film
for
us
to
see
and
that
we
could
still
ask
for
change
which
i
felt
be
a
charade
in
march
several
of
us
go
to
the
view
in
jack
valenti
s
screen
room
at
the
motion
picture
association
because
we
be
all
so
nervous
we
sat
in
pocket
around
the
room
when
the
movie
end
there
be
dead
silence
finally
redford
get
up
and
say
jesus
somebody
say
something
you
must
have
some
reaction
to
it
then
there
be
a
lot
of
nervous
babble
in
fact
i
love
the
movie
i
write
redford
afterwards
send
the
letter
via
woodward
i
suddenly
realize
that
the
impact
of
the
movie
as
we
saw
it
with
you
and
with
each
other
be
so
great
and
we
be
all
so
tense
that
i
have
never
told
you
what
i
thought
of
it
it
s
just
extraordinary
in
every
way
you
really
do
what
you
told
me
you
be
try
to
do
and
i
thought
impossible
but
you
do
it
it
prof
a
lot
of
thing
that
defy
reason
my
reason
be
that
the
story
couldn
t
be
laid
out
straight
because
if
you
do
it
would
bore
people
and
if
you
have
to
hype
it
it
would
hurt
the
paper
my
other
concern
for
the
paper
and
all
our
life
be
no
doubt
overdrawn
but
real
i
m
only
sorry
about
them
because
i
m
afraid
i
let
them
interfere
with
the
kind
of
simple
direct
relation
i
usually
enjoy
and
value
so
i
want
to
be
very
sure
you
know
that
i
deeply
admire
what
you
do
in
create
all
the
president
s
men
it
picture
carl
and
bob
almost
eerily
as
i
perceive
them
they
be
tenacious
able
complex
intelligent
and
wise
beyond
their
year
funny
and
nice
incidentally
they
have
also
withstood
fame
sensibly
and
decently
it
really
do
tell
people
what
a
newspaper
be
like
the
important
thing
i
thought
you
couldn
t
do
we
be
grateful
for
the
vision
you
have
for
all
the
incredible
hard
work
financial
investment
passion
for
your
profession
consume
attention
to
detail
all
those
thing
we
all
strive
for
and
most
of
all
the
love
and
care
that
make
the
movie
one
of
which
we
will
all
be
proud
always
to
pile
one
irony
on
another
the
world
premiere
of
the
movie
take
place
in
april
at
the
eisenhower
theater
at
the
kennedy
center
next
door
to
the
watergate
and
president
ford
sent
me
ticket
for
the
presidential
box
along
with
the
key
to
the
refrigerator
in
the
box
which
contain
champagne
for
me
and
my
guest
with
his
compliment
the
movie
s
effect
on
us
at
the
post
be
electric
yet
a
little
like
a
bite
from
the
apple
of
discord
maybe
it
wasn
t
just
the
movie
but
rather
the
outcome
of
watergate
itself
sometimes
the
god
give
us
too
much
and
then
exact
a
price
i
suggest
this
discord
because
the
portrayal
in
the
movie
of
the
role
various
people
have
played
have
a
negative
effect
on
several
real
life
relationship
the
movie
give
everything
to
ben
largely
because
that
make
for
a
simpler
story
line
and
because
he
be
played
by
jason
robards
but
of
course
that
wasn
t
ben
s
fault
howard
simon
be
make
quite
bitter
by
the
movie
he
be
poorly
treat
all
for
the
sake
of
clarity
and
simplicity
much
of
what
he
have
actually
do
throughout
watergate
be
divide
up
in
the
movie
between
ben
and
harry
rosenfeld
barry
sussman
be
left
out
altogether
which
must
have
hurt
his
feeling
even
more
than
mine
be
hurt
by
have
be
omit
alan
pakula
later
justified
my
exclusion
by
point
out
that
i
figure
only
marginally
in
the
book
as
well
although
ben
s
and
my
relationship
have
be
strengthen
by
watergate
others
be
not
so
lucky
the
relationship
between
howard
and
ben
which
have
be
so
generous
and
fruitful
be
never
the
same
again
meg
described
it
best
later
when
she
say
we
have
have
a
lot
of
fun
together
there
be
trust
and
affection
among
us
that
come
apart
in
many
complicate
way
people
get
on
each
other
s
nerve
everybody
would
claim
a
different
reason
for
it
each
of
us
would
claim
we
be
without
sin
as
a
story
watergate
be
in
many
way
a
journalist
s
dream
although
it
didn
t
seem
that
way
in
those
first
month
when
we
be
so
alone
but
the
story
have
all
the
ingredient
for
major
drama
suspense
embattle
people
on
both
side
right
and
wrong
law
and
order
good
and
bad
watergate
that
be
all
of
the
many
illegal
and
improper
act
that
be
include
under
that
rubric
be
a
political
scandal
unlike
any
other
its
sheer
magnitude
and
reach
put
it
on
a
scale
altogether
different
from
past
political
scandal
in
part
because
of
the
unparalleled
involvement
of
so
many
men
so
close
to
the
president
and
because
of
the
large
amount
of
money
raise
stash
and
spent
in
covert
and
illegal
way
this
be
indeed
a
new
kind
of
corruption
in
government
even
today
some
people
think
the
whole
thing
be
a
minor
peccadillo
the
sort
of
thing
engage
in
by
lot
of
politician
i
believe
watergate
be
an
unprecedented
effort
to
subvert
the
political
process
it
be
a
pervasive
indiscriminate
use
of
power
and
authority
from
an
administration
with
a
passion
for
secrecy
and
deception
and
an
astound
lack
of
regard
for
the
normal
constraint
of
democratic
politics
to
my
mind
the
whole
thing
be
a
very
real
perversion
of
the
democratic
system
from
fire
people
who
be
good
republican
but
who
might
have
disagreed
with
nixon
in
the
slightest
to
the
wiretappings
to
the
break
and
enter
of
ellsberg
s
psychiatrist
s
office
to
the
myriad
dirty
trick
to
the
attempt
to
discredit
and
curb
the
medium
as
i
say
in
a
speech
at
the
time
it
be
a
conspiracy
not
of
greed
but
of
arrogance
and
fear
by
men
who
come
to
equate
their
own
political
well
be
with
the
nation
s
very
survival
and
security
the
role
of
the
post
in
all
of
this
be
simply
to
report
the
news
we
set
out
to
pursue
a
story
that
unfolded
before
our
eye
in
way
that
make
us
as
incredulous
as
the
rest
of
the
public
the
post
be
never
out
to
get
nixon
or
as
be
often
allege
to
bring
down
the
president
it
always
seem
to
me
outrageous
to
accuse
the
post
of
pursue
the
watergate
story
because
of
the
democratic
bias
of
the
paper
a
highly
unusual
burglary
at
the
headquarters
of
a
national
political
party
be
an
important
story
and
we
would
have
give
it
the
same
treatment
regardless
of
which
party
be
in
power
or
who
be
run
for
election
i
be
often
ask
why
we
didn
t
cover
ted
kennedy
s
debacle
at
chappaquiddick
as
fully
as
we
be
cover
watergate
the
point
be
we
do
and
the
far
point
be
that
the
kennedy
be
probably
as
angry
at
us
then
as
the
nixon
administration
be
throughout
watergate
i
be
amaze
at
the
regular
allegation
that
somehow
we
have
create
the
agony
of
watergate
by
recklessly
pursue
certain
story
and
thereby
cause
the
turmoil
that
the
president
be
in
how
could
anyone
make
this
argument
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
story
we
report
turn
out
to
be
true
in
the
end
nixon
be
his
own
bad
enemy
the
post
have
no
enemy
list
the
president
do
nixon
seem
to
regard
the
post
as
incurably
liberal
and
ceaselessly
antiadministration
in
fact
the
post
support
a
great
many
of
his
policy
and
program
but
his
paranoia
his
hatred
of
the
press
his
scheme
all
contribute
to
bring
him
down
help
along
by
the
appropriate
constitutional
process
include
the
grand
jury
court
and
congress
woodward
and
bernstein
be
critical
figure
in
see
that
the
truth
be
eventually
told
but
others
be
at
least
as
important
judge
sirica
senator
sam
ervin
and
the
senate
watergate
committee
special
prosecutor
cox
and
jaworski
the
house
impeachment
committee
under
representative
peter
rodino
the
post
be
an
important
part
but
only
a
part
of
the
watergate
story
my
own
role
throughout
watergate
be
both
easy
and
hard
to
define
watergate
no
doubt
be
the
most
important
occurrence
in
my
work
life
but
my
involvement
be
basically
peripheral
rarely
direct
for
the
most
part
i
be
behind
the
scene
i
be
a
kind
of
devil
s
advocate
ask
question
all
along
the
way
question
about
whether
we
be
be
fair
factual
and
accurate
i
have
a
constant
conversation
with
ben
and
howard
as
i
do
with
the
top
two
editorial
writer
phil
and
meg
so
i
be
inform
in
general
as
be
my
habit
before
watergate
i
often
attend
the
daily
morning
editorial
meeting
where
the
issue
be
regularly
discuss
and
where
editorial
policy
be
form
what
i
do
primarily
be
stand
behind
the
editor
and
reporter
in
whom
i
believe
as
time
go
on
i
do
this
more
publicly
defend
us
in
speech
and
remark
to
group
around
the
country
indeed
internationally
as
well
my
large
responsibility
be
to
the
company
as
a
whole
beyond
the
paper
and
to
our
shareholder
i
have
often
be
credit
with
courage
for
backing
our
editor
in
watergate
the
truth
be
that
i
never
felt
there
be
much
choice
courage
applies
when
one
have
a
choice
with
watergate
there
be
never
one
major
decisive
moment
when
i
or
anyone
could
have
suggest
that
we
stop
reporting
the
story
watergate
unfolded
gradually
by
the
time
the
story
have
grown
to
the
point
where
the
size
of
it
dawn
on
us
we
have
already
wad
deeply
into
its
stream
once
i
found
myself
in
the
deepest
water
in
the
middle
of
the
current
there
be
no
go
back
it
be
an
unbelievable
two
year
of
pressure
existence
which
diminish
only
a
little
as
other
publication
join
us
and
as
the
separate
investigation
and
the
court
case
spawn
by
watergate
begin
to
confirm
and
amplify
our
reporting
when
it
be
perfectly
obvious
that
our
existence
as
a
company
be
at
stake
we
of
course
become
embattle
watergate
threaten
to
ruin
the
paper
the
post
and
the
washington
post
company
survive
partly
because
of
the
great
skill
and
tenacity
that
our
reporter
and
editor
and
executive
brought
to
bear
throughout
the
crisis
and
partly
because
of
luck
in
fact
the
role
of
luck
be
essential
in
watergate
and
luck
be
on
our
side
one
have
to
recognize
it
and
use
it
but
without
luck
the
end
result
for
us
could
have
be
very
different
from
the
first
incident
of
the
guard
find
the
taped
door
at
the
watergate
building
to
the
police
send
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
a
beat
up
look
undercover
car
that
be
cruise
in
the
area
rather
than
a
squad
car
that
might
have
tipped
off
the
burglar
to
the
source
willing
some
even
eager
to
talk
and
help
we
be
lucky
we
be
lucky
that
the
original
burglary
take
place
in
washington
and
be
a
local
story
we
be
lucky
that
those
under
investigation
compound
their
own
situation
by
far
mistake
and
misas
sessments
we
be
lucky
we
have
the
resource
to
pursue
the
story
we
be
lucky
that
both
woodward
and
bernstein
be
young
and
single
and
therefore
willing
and
able
to
work
sixteen
and
eighteen
hour
day
seven
day
a
week
for
month
on
end
at
least
with
few
repercussion
than
married
men
might
have
have
we
be
lucky
nixon
be
eccentric
enough
to
set
up
a
tap
system
in
the
white
house
without
which
he
might
have
complete
his
term
we
be
also
lucky
that
none
of
us
go
over
the
precipice
under
the
stagger
pressure
during
the
summer
of
the
strain
on
ben
be
so
great
his
responsibility
for
all
the
people
under
him
for
be
right
for
be
accurate
that
his
eyelid
begin
to
droop
a
doctor
told
him
it
might
be
a
serious
symptom
indicate
a
brain
tumor
or
an
aneurysm
after
ten
day
of
torture
from
the
suspense
it
turn
out
to
be
a
nervous
condition
the
calmer
people
look
and
act
under
extreme
pressure
the
more
likely
they
be
to
pay
the
price
with
physical
symptom
watergate
be
a
transform
event
in
the
life
of
the
washington
post
as
it
be
for
many
of
us
at
the
paper
and
throughout
journalism
anything
as
big
as
watergate
change
you
and
i
believe
it
change
not
only
the
post
and
me
but
journalism
as
a
whole
there
be
both
positive
and
negative
effect
at
the
post
watergate
test
our
whole
organization
our
talent
our
skill
our
ability
to
organize
and
mobilize
resource
to
handle
a
long
term
major
investigation
while
still
cover
the
daily
news
ultimately
watergate
show
what
could
be
do
by
reporter
arduously
and
painstakingly
pursue
investigative
work
by
editor
remain
skeptical
and
demand
and
as
dispassionate
as
possible
under
the
circumstance
and
by
editorial
writer
help
to
keep
the
question
foremost
in
the
mind
of
our
reader
more
important
in
term
of
its
effect
watergate
catapult
the
post
to
true
national
and
international
prominence
the
paper
become
know
throughout
the
world
because
of
it
on
one
level
the
change
image
of
the
post
be
flatter
on
another
it
be
both
disturb
and
distract
to
get
on
with
other
thing
as
i
write
denis
hamilton
of
the
london
sunday
time
the
positive
press
we
begin
to
get
be
heady
and
head
turn
stuff
but
the
world
fortunately
have
a
way
of
keep
one
humble
if
the
world
didn
t
do
it
i
be
determine
to
remind
all
of
us
of
the
need
as
i
say
in
a
letter
to
carl
and
bob
to
keep
the
demon
pomposity
in
control
the
sound
of
our
own
voice
while
listen
to
by
us
with
some
awe
and
even
some
admiration
be
recede
and
if
it
isn
t
there
be
all
sort
of
stark
reality
before
us
to
restore
balance
and
defy
hubris
i
come
to
be
talk
about
and
write
about
more
and
more
i
be
especially
bother
by
be
talk
about
as
powerful
often
refer
to
in
one
headline
or
story
or
another
as
the
most
powerful
woman
in
america
make
me
feel
like
some
kind
of
weight
lifter
or
body
builder
actually
i
be
amaze
at
this
perception
relate
to
power
and
confound
by
how
absurd
it
be
to
be
single
me
out
as
more
powerful
than
punch
sulzberger
or
bill
paley
for
example
who
control
more
powerful
company
but
be
men
i
be
also
concerned
for
the
paper
and
for
all
of
us
include
myself
that
if
your
profile
get
up
too
high
it
will
be
a
target
someone
or
something
will
bring
you
down
accordingly
i
do
only
interview
that
i
thought
be
professional
and
try
very
hard
to
avoid
the
personal
one
i
be
fairly
confident
that
the
work
of
post
reporter
and
editor
would
withstand
critical
scrutiny
i
once
say
to
truman
capote
that
it
look
as
if
either
i
m
go
to
jail
or
they
be
on
the
other
hand
i
have
to
admit
that
i
be
frighten
i
be
frighten
of
the
power
of
a
man
and
his
minion
of
a
president
who
thought
he
have
the
power
to
wrap
himself
in
the
cloak
of
national
security
i
be
frighten
for
the
future
of
the
washington
post
company
and
particularly
after
fritz
die
and
i
become
chairman
as
well
as
publisher
my
responsibility
weigh
heavily
on
me
watergate
also
change
the
way
journalism
and
journalist
be
view
and
in
fact
the
way
they
work
during
the
watergate
affair
we
at
the
post
at
least
have
developed
certain
habit
that
be
hard
to
break
john
anderson
an
editorial
writer
insightfully
discuss
this
in
some
note
he
make
on
the
editorial
page
at
the
time
we
have
become
accustom
to
a
high
degree
of
tension
and
drama
morning
editorial
conference
have
become
obsessive
as
we
go
back
and
forth
for
hour
over
each
day
s
event
quickly
they
come
to
take
up
the
entire
morning
as
we
sat
around
phil
s
geyelin
office
with
the
paper
spread
out
before
us
the
post
s
triumph
in
watergate
be
well
know
but
we
paid
a
large
price
for
it
that
have
have
little
attention
when
it
finally
end
with
nixon
s
resignation
life
for
all
of
us
be
suddenly
less
interest
for
a
long
time
afterward
news
coverage
be
eccentric
and
spotty
because
half
the
staff
particularly
young
metro
reporter
be
off
chase
mini
scandal
it
be
a
matter
of
year
before
we
get
back
to
consistent
orderly
coverage
of
school
board
and
county
council
young
people
flock
into
journalism
some
for
good
reason
and
some
hop
to
be
woodward
or
bernstein
certainly
watergate
provide
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
the
national
medium
do
indeed
shape
event
clearly
press
report
contribute
to
judge
sirica
s
doubt
about
what
he
be
hearing
in
his
courtroom
to
congressional
question
to
public
concern
but
we
don
t
set
out
to
have
such
a
major
impact
no
one
least
of
all
the
press
itself
think
we
be
free
from
error
and
fault
or
completely
without
bias
i
never
once
have
believe
that
we
in
the
press
do
everything
right
but
we
try
to
keep
our
opinion
confine
to
the
editorial
page
the
natural
adversarial
relationship
between
the
press
and
the
president
be
subvert
in
the
case
of
watergate
and
that
too
affected
journalism
i
be
somewhat
alarmed
by
certain
tendency
toward
over
involvement
which
i
felt
we
should
overcome
as
quickly
as
we
could
the
press
after
watergate
have
to
guard
against
the
romantic
tendency
to
picture
itself
in
the
role
of
a
heroic
and
beleaguer
champion
defend
all
virtue
against
overwhelm
odds
watergate
have
be
an
aberration
and
i
felt
we
couldn
t
look
everywhere
for
conspiracy
and
cover
ups
on
the
other
hand
i
don
t
believe
we
overcovered
watergate
as
some
nixon
supporter
claimed
to
the
last
as
astound
as
watergate
be
to
the
country
and
the
government
it
underscored
the
crucial
role
of
a
free
able
and
energetic
press
we
saw
how
much
power
the
government
have
to
reveal
what
it
want
when
it
want
to
give
the
people
only
the
authorize
version
of
event
we
relearn
the
lesson
of
the
importance
of
the
right
of
a
newspaper
to
keep
its
source
confidential
the
credibility
of
the
press
stood
the
test
of
time
against
the
credibility
of
those
who
spent
so
much
time
self
righteously
deny
their
own
wrongdoing
and
assault
us
by
assail
our
performance
and
our
motif
in
a
speech
i
make
in
before
the
pentagon
paper
and
before
watergate
i
say
t
he
cheap
solution
be
sought
by
the
administration
will
in
the
long
run
turn
out
to
be
very
costly
indeed
they
do
chapter
twenty
five
if
i
d
ever
have
an
inclination
to
let
watergate
and
the
concomitant
fame
for
the
post
go
to
my
head
management
problem
throughout
the
company
generally
and
labor
problem
particularly
at
the
post
at
which
i
be
fail
dismally
kept
me
root
in
reality
the
problem
be
entrench
burdensome
and
all
absorb
i
have
hop
to
get
some
real
help
from
paul
ignatius
but
that
have
not
happen
paul
be
a
thoroughly
nice
well
intentioned
man
but
he
come
from
a
very
different
culture
and
never
really
learn
the
communication
business
when
i
decide
that
we
need
a
new
president
of
the
post
and
when
we
announce
paul
s
resignation
in
october
i
view
it
as
a
failure
of
all
of
us
in
management
who
have
erroneously
place
someone
in
an
inappropriate
position
though
i
never
make
any
major
move
by
myself
particularly
change
a
top
executive
and
though
much
of
the
criticism
i
receive
over
the
year
be
deserve
the
decision
be
always
publicly
view
as
be
only
my
mistake
because
of
the
new
conspicuousness
of
the
company
and
the
fact
that
i
be
a
woman
i
get
overly
lionize
for
our
editorial
victory
and
overly
criticize
for
correct
my
mistake
rather
than
for
make
them
in
the
first
place
both
of
which
i
resent
at
that
time
if
a
woman
fire
a
man
everyone
assume
the
woman
be
at
fault
indeed
i
be
view
and
publicly
pillory
as
a
difficult
whimsical
tyrannical
tempestuous
woman
the
man
be
perceive
as
a
victim
newspaper
executive
suffer
from
press
criticism
too
at
least
i
do
in
any
case
have
grown
to
know
the
industry
and
to
have
slightly
more
knowledge
of
what
i
be
look
for
i
go
outside
the
company
again
and
hire
john
prescott
as
the
new
president
of
the
post
in
effect
as
the
general
manager
we
have
upgraded
the
title
to
president
for
paul
because
he
have
be
secretary
of
the
navy
on
paper
john
look
perfectly
qualify
he
have
have
a
distinguish
newspaper

at
the
baltimore
sun
twenty
year
before
and
he
have
spent
four
year
on
the
detroit
free
press
as
labor
relation
manager
which
be
especially
important
for
what
he
could
bring
to
bear
on
our
desperate
labor
situation
as
well
as
two
year
at
the
miami
herald
a
well
run
nonunion
paper
he
have
also
be
general

of
the
knight

and
in

at
the
begin
of
john
visit
the
paper
and
met
with
the
executive
after
which
he
write
me
a
fairly
accurate
appraisal
of
what
he
d
see
and
what
he
felt
should
be
do
immediately
since
i
be
more
than
ready
to
move
us
off
the
mark
i
be
delighted
with
his
action
orient
approach
i
have
become
more
and
more
aware
of
the
difficulty
we
be
in
and
be
worried
about
problem
on
several
front
the
poor
labor
contract
that
seem
to
keep
us
in
a
straitjacket
the
far
disintegration
of
production
the
constant
crisis
management
get
the
paper
out
each
night
as
i
described
it
to
john

one
last
minute

after
another

either
minor
or
major
disaster

breathtaking

john
start
to
take
hold
although
i
be
puzzle
and
concerned
about
certain
thing
he
do
i
be
pleased
by
a
great
deal
of
what
he
accomplish
some
of
which
have
a
lot
to
do
with
our
success

six
month

john

in
jim
cooper
a
young
production
expert
who
knew
the
technicality
of
how

and
john
replace
our
production
director
with
his
assistant
a
less
astute
move
but
it
be
hard
to
find
outsider
willing
to
step
into
our
well
know
hornet
nest
with
fritz
s
death
one
learn
curve
have
come
to
an
end
the
first
ten
year
of
wad
in
of
feel
my
way
respond
to
circumstance
and
problem
as
they
arose
i
didn
t
realize
how
protect
i
have
be
by
fritz
i
be
now
alone
again
but
in
a
different
way
i
become
chairman
it
never
occur
to
me
to
change
the
gender
of
what
i
consider
a
neutral
title
of
the
board
of
this
grow
public
company
while
remain
publisher
of
the
post
i
be
now
the
person
with
ultimate
responsibility
at
the
washington
post
company
with
all
that
that
entail
a
whole
new
learn
curve
face
me
how
to
be
chief
executive
officer
of
a
public
company
with
obligation
to
shareholder
how
to
apply
what
little
i
d
learn
about
management
to
the
business
of
the
company
how
to
maintain
editorial
quality
while
exercise
financial
responsibility
i
felt
as
though
i
be
lie
on
a
nice
bed
of
nail
inadequate
to
all
of
the
problem
i
face
an
affidavit
about
the
hour
i
be
put
into
the
job
would
have
attest
to
my
good
intention
but
result
be
what
i
care
about
i
didn
t
know
how
and
when
to
think
about
growth
how
the
job
description
of
a
chief
executive
officer
would
read
how
much
profit
we
should
be
make
or
should
be
aim
to
make
perhaps
my
standard
be
unrealistically
high
i
be
judging
myself
by
the
ease
with
which
phil
at
his
best
have
seem
to
deal
with
his
problem
or
by
some
other
imagine
ideal
of
what
be
expect
of
me
because
i
still
have
vast
problem
with
self
confidence
in
public
situation
i
fear
deal
with
the
industry
and
with
wall
street
especially
the
excruciate
ordeal
of
speak
to
financial
analyst
because
we
be
a
public
company
if
i
hash
thing
up
now
the
mistake
be
all
go
to
be
visible
in
truth
i
didn
t
even
know
how
much
i
didn
t
know
or
the
complexity
of
what
lay
before
me
what
i
do
know
be
that
i
wasn
t
at
all
sure
that
i
could
do
what
be
go
to
be
require
of
me
good
luck
be
again
on
my
side
come
just
when
i
need
it
it
be
my
great
good
fortune
that
about
a
month
after
fritz
s
death
warren
buffett
bought
into
the
company
begin
a
whole
new
phase
of
my
life
warren
s
arrival
not
only
launch
me
on
my
new
learn
curve
but
also
marked
the
begin
of
a
friendship
that
have
go
well
beyond
the
relationship
of
an
owner
to
a
large
stockholder
warren
have
actually
make
a
cameo
appearance
in
my
life
in
when
he
and
his
business
partner
charlie
munger
come
to
see
me
about
a
possible
partnership
with
them
to
acquire
the
new
yorker
from
peter
fleischmann
the
project
die
and
i
didn
t
see
warren
again
or
even
particularly
remember
him
until
he
write
me
a
letter
two
year
later
this
letter
be
still
jokingly
refer
to
by
us
as
the
dear
mr
graham
letter
under
sec
regulation
anyone
buying
as
much
as
percent
of
the
stock
in
a
company
be
require
by
law
to
notify
the
officer
of
the
company
about
such
a
purchase
warren
inform
me
that
through
berkshire
hathaway
he
have
bought
more
than
share
of
the
class
b
share
of
the
washington
post
company
and
intend
to
buy
more
the
letter
help
explain
why
he
d
bought
the
stock
this
purchase
represent
a
sizable
commitment
to
us
and
an
explicitly
quantify
compliment
to
the
post
as
a
business
enterprise
and
to
you
as
its
chief
executive
write
a
check
separate
conviction
from
conversation
i
recognize
that
the
post
be
graham
control
and
graham
manage
and
that
suit
me
fine
some
year
back
a
partnership
which
i
manage
make
a
significant
investment
in
the
stock
of
walt
disney
production
the
stock
be
ridiculously
cheap
base
upon
earnings
asset
value
and
capability
of
management
that
alone
be
enough
to
make
my
pulse
quicken
and
pocketbook
open
but
there
be
also
an
important
extra
dimension
to
the
investment
in
its
field
disney
simply
be
the
fine
hand
down
anything
that
didn
t
reflect
his
best
effort
anything
that
might
leave
the
customer
feel
short
change
just
wasn
t
acceptable
to
walt
disney
he
meld
energetic
creativity
with
a
discipline
regard
profitability
and
achieve
something
unique
in
entertainment
i
feel
the
same
way
about
the
washington
post
the
stock
be
dramatically
undervalue
relative
to
the
intrinsic
worth
of
its
constituent
property
although
that
be
true
of
many
security
in
today
s
market
but
the
twin
attraction
to
the
undervaluation
be
an
enterprise
that
have
become
synonymous
for
quality
in
communication
how
much
more
satisfy
it
be
go
to
be
to
watch
an
investment
in
the
post
grow
over
the
year
than
it
would
be
to
own
stock
in
some
garden
variety
company
which
though
cheap
have
no
sense
of
purpose
i
be
additionally
impressed
by
the
sense
of
stewardship
project
by
your
communication
to
fellow
shareholder
they
be
factual
complete
and
interest
as
you
bring
your
establish
newspaper
standard
for
integrity
to
the
newer
field
of
corporate
reporting
you
may
remember
that
i
be
in
your
office
about
two
year
ago
with
charles
munger
discuss
the
new
yorker
at
the
time
i
mention
to
you
that
i
have
receive
my
financial
start
deliver
the
post
while
attend
woodrow
wilson
high
in
the
mid
s
although
i
deliver
about
post
per
day
my
record
of
loyalty
be
slightly
tarnished
in
that
i
also
have
the
time
herald
route
much
small
my
customer
be
discriminate
in
the
westchester
this
be
perhaps
the
first
faint
sign
to
keenly
perceptive
washingtonian
that
the
two
organization
eventually
would
get
together
i
should
mention
that
berkshire
hathaway
have
no
radio
or
television
property
so
that
we
will
not
be
a
complicate
factor
with
the
fcc
our
only
communication
property
be
the
ownership
of
sun
newspaper
of
omaha
a
group
of
financially
but
not
editorially
insignificant
weekly
newspaper
in
the
metropolitan
omaha
area
last
month
our
whole
organization
seventy
people
counting
printing
go
into
orbit
when
we
won
a
pulitzer
for
our
reporting
on
boy
town
s
undisclosed
wealth
incidentally
newsweek
and
time
use
approximately
equal
space
in
cover
the
story
last
year
but
newsweek
s
reporting
job
be
far
superior
you
can
see
that
the
post
have
a
rather
fervent
fan
out
in
omaha
i
have
hope
that
as
fund
become
available
we
will
add
to
our
holding
at
which
time
i
will
send
along
amend
d
filing
cordially
warren
e
buffett
i
knew
nothing
about
this
man
who
have
just
bought
a
significant
chunk
of
the
company
warren
be
the
same
person
then
that
he
be
now
but
he
be
a
relatively
small
investor
at
the
time
and
mostly
unknown
i
knew
that
he
have
bought
into
the
company
because
it
fit
his
rule
for
investment
and
because
our
stock
be
so
cheap
at
that
moment
all
stock
be
sell
below
their
value
thanks
to
a
recession
and
ours
be
sell
below
other
stock
since
we
be
relatively
unknown
in
the
business
world
and
because
of
the
challenge
to
our
florida
television
station
license
and
possibly
too
because
of
fritz
s
death
and
my
succession
but
i
knew
nothing
about
warren
personally
i
also
knew
so
little
about
the
operation
of
the
stock
market
that
it
take
others
to
alarm
me
about
an
unknown
investor
buying
such
a
big
piece
of
the
company
i
have
no
idea
about
takeover
i
felt
safe
with
the
system
we
have
in
place
of
the
family
control
a
share
as
oppose
to
the
b
share
that
warren
be
buying
warren
assume
i
felt
safe
and
so
didn
t
see
the
need
to
assuage
any
fear
but
so
great
be
the
alarm
that
come
from
men
around
me
and
from
the
few
business
people
i
knew
include
andr
meyer
head
of
lazard
that
i
grow
concerned
their
message
clearly
be
he
mean
you
no
good
i
try
to
find
out
whatever
i
could
about
this
man
research
turn
up
only
one
highly
flatter
chapter
in
a
book
title
supermoney
by
adam
smith
which
be
read
voraciously
by
several
of
us
at
the
post
shortly
after
warren
s
letter
arrive
and
when
i
call
everyone
i
knew
who
might
know
warren
directly
or
indirectly
no
one
i
spoke
to
have
anything
but
positive
reaction
he
have
never
do
anything
hostile
he
be
straight
brilliant
fine
one
of
phil
s
major
influence
on
me
be
the
idea
of
reach
out
to
different
kind
of
people
he
have
encourage
me
and
the
child
to
be
curious
about
people
not
to
assume
thing
about
them
and
their
motif
without
get
to
know
them
he
emphasize
the
importance
of
not
believe
in
stereotype
not
only
because
they
don
t
hold
true
to
form
but
because
you
miss
so
much
if
you
allow
them
to
dominate
your
response
i
follow
this
impulse
with
warren
and
answer
his
letter
tell
him
how
totally
commit
i
be
to
effective
business
management
in
our
enterprise
thank
him
for
his
confidence
in
us
and
say
i
hop
we
could
live
up
to
the
flatter
comparison
to
the
disney
company
a
hope
not
exactly
fulfil
by
this
time
i
be
curious
and
even
nervously
eager
to
meet
him
when
i
realize
i
would
be
in
california
that
summer
i
write
him
to
suggest
our
get
together
out
there
since
i
knew
he
would
be
at
his
vacation
house
in
laguna
beach
i
be
go
to
be
meeting
with
the
post
s
news
service
partner
at
the
los
angeles
time
and
the
time
offer
us
a
room
in
which
the
two
of
us
could
talk
when
we
met
in
los
angeles
warren
s
very
appearance
surprised
me
he
resemble
no
wall
street
figure
or
business
tycoon
i
d
ever
met
rather
he
come
across
as
corn
fed
and
midwestern
but
with
that
extraordinary
combination
of
quality
that
have
appeal
to
me
throughout
my
life
brain
and
humor
i
like
him
from
the
start
as
i
later
write
a
friend
if
i
would
ever
bet
on
someone
be
mr
clean
it
s
buffett
at
our
meeting
warren
persist
in
analogize
between
disney
and
the
post
company
because
at
the
time
it
look
as
if
no
one
care
about
our
company
he
told
me
he
have
a
feel
not
only
that
wall
street
didn
t
see
the
value
of
the
post
company
but
that
even
i
and
the
group
from
the
post
didn
t
appreciate
how
valuable
it
really
be
he
say
that
someday
the
market
would
recognize
its
value
although
one
couldn
t
predict
when
at
that
first
meeting
warren
saw
that
i
knew
nothing
about
business
and
finance
and
far
that
i
thought
people
like
otis
chandler
and
others
knew
much
more
he
later
told
me
he
have
the
impression
that
my
perception
be
there
be
all
these
foot
high
people
around
who
be
go
to
eat
me
alive
i
didn
t
feel
as
though
i
knew
him
well
but
i
instinctively
trust
him
and
invite
him
with
his
wife
to
lunch
both
at
newsweek
in
new
york
and
at
the
post
in
washington
as
well
as
to
my
house
for
dinner
when
he
come
east
he
accepted
and
we
set
a
date
i
be
fascinate
by
this
man
shortly
after
our
meeting

my
big
worry

to
do
with
the

where

and
labor
problem
most
interrelate

be
still
a
mess
and
the

be
at
war
with
us
about
who
be
go
to
run
the
building
since
they
knew
only
too
well
the
nature
of
our
weakness
and
their
strength
our
production
problem
go
back
so
many
year
and
involve
so
many
people
and
circumstance
that
it
be
difficult
even
to
explain
them
much
less
solve
them
big

with
only
a
few
exception

by
the

most
of
our
labor
trouble
and
certainly
our
great
expense
be
center
on
the
compose
room
where
the
printer
work
as
early
as
the
mid
s
the
printer
have
begin
slowdown
which
increase
in
number
and
intensity
into
the
early
s
especially
at
contract
time
slow
down
be
a
belligerent
action
by
which
the
printer
purposely
delayed
the
paper
in
any
number
of
way
by
set
type
at

anywhere
else
and
generally
conduct
a
kind
of
guerrilla
warfare
against
the

and
the
editor
who
have
to
go
down
to
the
fourth
floor
the

turf
to
make
up

if
the
printer
slow
down
the
press
ran
late
and
reader
get
their
post
late
sometimes
very
late
the
slowdown
be
aim
directly
at
our
circulation
at
a
time
of
intense
competition
because
the
post
be
grow
and
try
to
get
ahead
of
the
star
throughout
this
time
we
have
put
up
with
these
slowdown
to
a
degree
that
be
extremely
shortsighted
during
the
s
union
income
at
the
post
have
risen
greatly
through
wage
increase
and
huge
overtime
pay
which
put
additional
pressure
on
the
whole
collective
bargaining
process
we
have
negotiate
an
amazingly
lucrative
contract
with
the
printer
that
include
a
category

in
those

from
most
large
national

already
set
the

a
kind
of
mat
a
cylindrical
cardboard
from
which
a
lead
plate
could
be
make
unfortunately
for
us
however
a
decade
old
clause
in
the
union
contract
decreed
that
the
type
have
to
be
reset
by
our
printer
proofed
correct
and
reprint
hard
as
it
be
to
believe
this
would
happen
and
then
the
whole
redone
thing
would
be
thrown
away
these
page
have
accumulate
exponentially
since
no
one
have
the
time
or
inclination
to
do
this
silly
work
it
be
correctly
name
reproduce
or
bogus
and
be
refer
to
as
accumulate
on
the
hook
naturally
the
union
fiercely
resist
let
us
set
up
a
plan
to
deal
with
this
and
refuse
to
let
us
buy
out
this
bogus
because
it
give
them
control
of
the
compose
room
and
meant
that
we
have
to
hire
any
printer
no
matter
how
many
who
show
up
and
want
a
job
on
the
theory
that
there
be
work
to
do
this
be
their
gravy
train
their
guarantee
of
job
forever
as
long
as
we
have
reproduce
on
the
hook
wait
to
be
set
any
printer
could
arrive
at
the
post
and
declare
he
be
go
to
work
for
us
we
could
do
nothing
to
stop
the
influx
of
unneeded
typesetter
and
have
score
of
these
printer
who
just
stood
around
and
drank
or
played
the
number
one
man
go
around
all
day
suck
an
orange
full
of
vodka
another
regularly
wore
a
nazi
uniform
to
work
morale
in
the
compose
room
be
terrible
and
performance
be
even
bad
there
be
many
printer
who
care
about
their
craft
and
about
the
post
but
thing
have
clearly
gotten
out
of
hand
and
put
the
paper
out
be
a
vastly
onerous
task
undertaken
largely
by
a
saint
neil
greenwald
an
assistant
production
manager
and
a
compose
room
foreman
earnie
smith
who
be
both
tough
and
able
but
be
hat
by
the
union
bad
of
all
when
the
star
bought
the
daily
news
in
four
hundred
printer
come
over
to
the
post
demand
work
which
they
get
because
of
the
reproduce
clause
overnight
we
go
from
four
hundred
to
eight
hundred
printer
there
be
no
question
that
we
have
run
the
compose
room
badly
but
we
be
come
into
an
age
when
the
industry
be
in
midpassage
between
one
technology
and
another
specifically
we
be
in
a
state
of
transition
from
hot
type
to
cold
type
or
photo
composition
hot
metal
printing
be
a
direct
descendant
of
the
technique
ben
franklin
have
use
to
set
poor
richard
s
almanack
in
the
eighteenth
century
but
whereas
ben
put
his
raise
letter
together
one
at
a
time
our
printer
use
linotype
machine
a
wondrous
late
nineteenth
century
invention
now
on
its
last
leg
hit
key
on
a
complex
keyboard
the
printer
assemble
letter
mold
into
a
line
of
type
hot
lead
pour
into
the
mold
to
form
the
line
the
story
be
proofread
and
when
correction
be
need
individual
line
have
to
be
replace
one
at
a
time
a
spectacularly
labor
intensive
process
as
long
as
this
system
be
in
place
it
be
impossible
to
function
during
a
strike
because
the
whole
process
of
set
type
with
hot
metal
be
so
complex
the
arrival
of
computer
and
photocomposition
which
set
type
about
time
faster
than
the
old
way
make
it
possible
to
set
type
automatically
thus
make
the
whole
process
simpler
safer
and
less
costly
now
management
could
run
production
without
the
craft
union
in
case
of
a
strike
the
balance
of
power
be
shift
it
be
the
heavily
unionized
big
city
paper
however
that
found
it
the
hardest
to
convert
to
cold
type
because
the
typographical
union
strong
on
large
paper
resist
the
change
know
what
it
portend
for
them
so
the
problem
of
what
to
do
about
the
thousand
of
page
of
reproduce
haunt
us
most
of
the
debate
about
it
focus
on
the
question
of
whether
we
should
eliminate
the
backlog
by
make
a
onetime
payment
to
the
union
or
by
finally
set
it
of
the
washington
paper
the
post
have
the
most
substantial
backlog
of
reproduce
by
far
date
from
it
have
accumulate
to
more
than
twenty
two
thousand
page
the
star
have
only
page
of
backlog
in
the
three
washington
newspaper
the
post
the
star
and
the
daily
news
have
propose
to
buy
the
backlog
for
nearly
million
the
post
offering
to
pay
million
of
it
or
nearly
per
page
when
the
union
turn
down
this
offer
we
actually
set
up
a
separate
room
to
try
to
work
through
the
enormous
backlog
but
it
kept
pour
in
the
printer
of
course
have
no
incentive
to
work
through
it
though
the
printer
remain
our
principal
problem
and
the
main
focus
of
our
attention
we
be
have
a
difficult
time
with
other
union
as
well
the
pressman
be
a
tough
blue
collar
union
all
white
with
one
exception
and
all
male
the
union
have
obtain
overtime
provision
that
enable
the
pressman
to
get
large
salary
especially
when
they
purposely
delayed
the
pressruns
by
sabotage
of
one
sort
or
another
throw
tiny
dart
into
the
newsprint
break
it
and
cause
delay
while
rewebbing
the
press
sometimes
they
left
the
press
run
with
only
a
handful
of
men
in
attendance
while
the
rest
take
nap
go
out
for
drink
or
even
work
at
the
star
yet
pressman
s
income
at
the
post
have
more
than
double
in
ten
year
and
our
wage
scale
be
the
high
or
in
some
craft
next
to
the
high
after
new
york
city
newspaper
in
the
country
with
liberal
fringe
benefit
overtime
be
a
large
proportion
of
all
the
wage
we
paid
and
be
grow
again
as
with
the
printer
there
be
many
good
hardworking
pressman
but
the
post
s
pressroom
be
overmanned
and
the
union
have
be
infiltrate
by
thug
who
have
arrive
from
city
like
newark
and
new
haven
and
kansa
city
where
the
paper
have
be
on
strike
and
the
pressman
have
be
replace
by
nonunion
people
our
contract
give
the
post
little
discretion
over
whom
we
hire
so
on
they
come
they
have
come
to
cash
in
on
the
rich
provision
of
our
contract
and
unfortunately
they
begin
to
gain
control
of
the
union
the
pressman
be
lead
by
jim
dugan
a
tough
able
leader
in
the
early
day
whose
sense
of
his
power
have
no
doubt
be
inflate
by
previous
win
in
contract
negotiation
not
to
speak
of
the
consistent
small
win
whenever
minor
altercation
take
place
the
little
deal
get
make
by
post
manager
with
union
official
at
the
water
cooler
with
wink
nod
and
handshake
on
the
side
our
record
of
give
in
be
so
extensive
and
so
bad
that
dugan
be
always
confident
that
the
pressman
could
keep
what
they
have
get
from
management
over
the
year
and
get
still
more
our
pressroom
have
go
from
bad
to
bad
under
his
strong
influence
and
because
of
our
weak
response
why
do
we
give
in
time
and
again
because
the
need
to
get
tomorrow
s
paper
print
not
to
lose
competitive
ground
to
the
star
be
always
so
great
dugan
have
no
reason
to
think
our
weakness
wouldn
t
last
forever
clearly
we
be
not
head
down
an
easy
path
the
stereotypers
who
cast
the
metal
plate
that
fit
on
the
press
form
a
separate
blue
collar
all
white
and
all
male
union
and
they
be
very
concerned
that
their
skill
would
no
longer
be
need
by
paper
go
to
photocomposition
or
cold
type
and
plastic
plate
the
stereotypers
be
lead
by
charlie
davis
a
rough
unbend
character
and
they
align
themselves
with
the
pressman
later
become
affiliate
with
that
union
oddly
both
dugan
and
davis
be
sort
of
friend
of
mine
in
many
way
i
think
we
be
mislead
by
them
or
at
least
i
be
in
walk
around
the
building
i
would
talk
with
both
of
them
they
could
be
charm
friendly
and
funny
and
they
communicate
with
us
much
of
the
time
but
neither
charlie
davis
nor
his
friend
jim
dugan
meant
us
any
good
throughout
the
production
area
of
the
post
we
be
try
to
encourage
our
supervisor
whose
position
be
complicate
because
they
be
also
member
of
the
union
to
manage
the
union
resist
more
and
more
when
jim
cooper
arrive
in
many
of
the
union
seem
to
view
his
come
as
an
act
of
war
on
the
part
of
management
the
pressman
stop
the
press
if
jim
or
indeed
anyone
from
management
enter
the
pressroom
hard
to
believe
but
true
the
newspaper
guild
have
be
at
the
paper
since
its
local
group
be
the
white
collar
union
that
oversaw
all
the
rest
of
the
building
it
be
one
of
the
large
and
strong
union
in
the
building
represent
a
wide
range
of
people
from
the
high
paid
reporter
and
editor
and
ad
salesman
down
to
clerk
circulation
and
classify
personnel
programmer
analyst
and
people
in
a
department
then
call
detail
who
collect
ad
and
brought
them
back
and
forth
to
be
set
and
proofed
these
subgroup
each
with
widely
diverse
interest
be
all
represent
at
the
same
table
bad
still
they
be
represent
in
negotiation
by
union
executive
from
outside
the
building
whose
interest
lay
in
get
the
big
settlement
in
the
country
and
who
at
that
time
care
little
about
the
specific
concern
of
people
at
the
post
the
post
s
unit
of
the
guild
have
the
high
or
second
high
pay
scale
in
the
country
and
be
confine
by
ridiculously
restrictive
rule
it
be
also
almost
impossible
for
us
to
fire
someone
short
of
proven
lie
cheat
or
steal
and
even
then
it
wasn
t
easy
just
plain
incompetence
be
not
a
valid
reason
much
less
mediocrity
or
laziness
in
one
instance
a
woman
s
page
reporter
under
time
pressure
to
leave
on
vacation
plagiarize
her
article
lift
an
entire
story
from
a
fine
art
commission
publication
we
try
to
fire
her
but
the
guild
take
the
case
to
arbitration
claim
that
this
be
a
common
practice
after
a
long
hearing
we
actually
be
able
to
let
her
go
but
this
example
show
the
length
to
which
we
have
to
go
even
in
the
face
of
proven
flagrant
violation
at
this
time
the
guild
be
lead
by
brian
flores
who
consistently
ask
for
and
receive
big
and
unprecedented
increase
in
salary
and
benefit
over
a
period
of
year
on
the
management
side
we
be
hopelessly
bad
at
deal
with
the
guild
at
one
point
in
the
fall
of
after
the
guild
contract
have
expire
there
be
endless
meeting
at
which
fritz
and
paul
ignatius
and
i
would
talk
with
jim
daly
who
be
ostensibly
run
the
negotiation
about
some
far
reach
proposal
he
want
to
make
there
be
others
present
also
and
everyone
felt
free
to
chip
in
and
offer
suggestion
the
whole
process
have
become
a
kind
of
endless
free
for
all
i
believe
the
one
person
not
there
be
larry
kennelly
the
actual
negotiator
with
the
guild
during
these
negotiation
we
be
have
trouble
respond
to
various
demand
for
paid
leaf
four
day
week
vacation
and
so
on
which
be
on
the
table
what
follow
be
complex
and
interest
and
by
no
mean
easy
despite
the
lighter
moment
we
sat
for
long
hour
in
a
smoke
fill
room
both
fritz
and
paul
smoke
cigar
continually
finally
because
we
felt
that
the
city
room
be
not
hearing
the
management
side
of
the
story
we
decide
to
enlist
the
help
of
the
top
editor
to
write
a
statement
that
could
be
present
to
the
guild
state
our
position
we
tapped
ben
and
howard
phil
geyelin
and
meg
all
of
whom
be
know
to
posse
great
authority
on
the
news
and
editorial
floor
as
well
as
some
knowledge
of
what
might
be
the
management
side
we
also
ask
them
because
they
be
our
friend
the
four
of
them
agree
and
retreat
to
a
bar
in
the
nearby
picklee
hotel
an
old
fashion
and
favorite
water
hole
call
the
old
corral
there
they
write
a
statement
on
long
yellow
paper
literally
saturate
with
martini
as
they
labor
over
it
plus
what
meg
described
as
some
boilerplate
stuff
the
three
men
then
ask
her
to
type
it
all
up
which
this
be
pre
liberation
she
do
single
file
they
then
come
into
the
board
room
where
several
of
us
be
gather
try
to
work
on
our
problem
i
look
up
as
they
file
in
and
could
see
instantly
that
they
be
all
four
totally
plaster
as
meg
remembers
i
get
a
huge
grin
on
my
face
and
say
meg
s
drunk
she
say
the
others
be
come
in
behind
her
and
burst
out
laugh
at
which
i
say
jesus
they
re
all
drunk
phil
geyelin
get
terribly
indignant
and
try
to
sober
up
quickly
he
hand
the
statement
to
me
i
begin
reading
it
stop
right
away
thanked
them
for
their
effort
and
sent
them
on
their
way
ben
always
hat
contract
time
the
inevitable
tension
and
altercation
often
tore
the
city
room
apart
and
interfere
with
his
plan
for
progress
since
he
be
focus
on
push
the
paper
forward
he
tend
to
get
impatient
with
the
business
side
see
these
period
of
tension
as
roadblock
to
progress
and
the
source
of
ill
will
in
the
city
room
when
management
become
determine
to
turn
thing
around
the
leader
of
the
guild
try
to
drive
a
wedge
between
ben
and
the
business
side
of
the
paper
for
too
long
my
sympathy
be
with
the
editor
with
whom
i
have
always
related
more
easily
than
with
the
business
executive
as
time
go
on
and
i
understood
the
problem
well
i
saw
that
the
editor
have
to
learn
to
become
manager
which
in
our
earlier
burst
of
growth
they
have
not
be
ask
to
be
and
indeed
weren
t
the
only
nonunion
area
of
the
post
be
the
circulation
delivery
organization
there
phil
harry
gladstein
and
jack
patterson
under
him
have
instal
distributor
who
handle
different
area
of
the
town
and
suburb
and
who
make
more
money
by
sell
more
paper
there
have
be
repeat
effort
to
organize
the
dealer
but
these
have
so
far
be
successfully
ward
off
though
there
be
constant
background
noise
from
a
nucleus
of
dissident
dealer
try
to
organize
the
others
one
thing
i
knew
be
that
the
life
and
future
of
the
post
depend
on
fend
off
a
circulation
union
i
knew
that
in
case
of
a
strike
if
we
be
ever
able
to
get
to
the
point
of
printing
without
the
craft
union
we
could
not
succeed
if
we
have
no
way
to
distribute
the
paper
we
knew
that
at
the
star
where
the
teamster
have
organize
the
delivery
truck
incentive
for
carry
and
distribute
additional
paper
have
be
eliminate
which
of
course
frustrate
attempt
to
grow
the
star
s
circulation
we
fought
hard
against
unionization
of
the
dealer
but
it
be
difficult
in
the
face
of
increase
slowdown
from
the
printer
the
dealer
suffer
greatly
because
of
the
lateness
of
paper
i
frequently
go
out
to
the
alley
late
at
night
and
stood
there
talk
with
and
listen
to
them
while
they
wait
for
the
paper
mostly
i
let
them
dump
on
me
as
a
way
of
let
them
know
that
i
care
i
remember
one
middle
of
the
night
vigil
when
one
of
the
men
i
knew
and
like
who
be
drive
furiously
out
of
the
alley
stuck
his
head
out
of
the
window
of
his
truck
and
say
well
if
it
isn
t
the
mother
superior
come
here
dear
he
let
me
have
a
good
piece
of
his
mind
from
the
compose
room
to
the
pressroom
the
post
be
entirely
out
of
control
after
john
sweeterman
left
we
didn
t
have
the
strength
and
know
how
to
address
labor
problem
at
the
top
complicate
thing
be
the
fact
that
all
the
washington
newspaper
use
to
negotiate
together
in
deal
with
the
union
john
prescott
and
his
star
counterpart
bin
lewis
have
met
with
the
union
leader
and
laid
out
the
situation
frankly
our
cost
be
too
high
and
we
be
head
for
trouble
bin
be
a
decent
and
able
man
a
member
of
the
star
s
enormous
family
and
he
shrewdly
let
john
do
all
the
talk
so
the
post
become
the
focus
of
union
hatred
and
attack
leave
the
star
less
vulnerable
prescott
larry
wallace
and
jim
cooper
be
constantly
harass
or
in
jim
s
case
torment
by
silence
since
the
union
label
him
a
notorious
strikebreaker
and
fin
people
who
spoke
to
him
although
this
silent
treatment
be
lift
some
month
later
after
cooper
have
improve
condition
in
the
stereotype
department
i
be
beside
myself
with
worry
night
after
night
the
question
be
how
could
we
get
tomorrow
s
paper
out
and
how
late
would
it
be
cost
be
escalate
profit
diminish
and
at
the
same
time
a
large
part
of
the
work
force
be
deeply
dissatisfied
and
hostile
know
we
have
to
begin
to
manage
to
regain
control
of
our
own
production
department
i
try
to
consult
various
people
about
what
to
do
i
met
with
sam
kagel
my
old
friend
from
my
san
francisco
day
whose
business
it
be
to
negotiate
for
union
i
also
invite
a
labor
economist
from
harvard
professor
john
dunlop
to
come
down
and
meet
with
us
to
ass
our
situation
and
help
develop
some
long
run
strategy
dunlop
suggest
set
up
ongoing
discussion
group
to
talk
about
issue
of
concern
and
interest
to
both
side
on
a
continue
basis
so
that
when
contract
negotiation
begin
anger
over
secondary
issue
would
not
impinge
on
the
bargaining
of
the
moment
he
also
suggest
the
need
for
well
communication
generally
so
i
invite
all
the
union
head
to
lunch
with
us
to
discus
peripheral
issue
the
new
building
for
instance
many
theory
be
propound
by
the
so
call
expert
i
consult
but
the
basic
truth
be
that
we
didn
t
have
the
thing
that
matter
most
competent
alert
manager
who
know
what
they
be
do
without
that
necessary
ingredient
we
weren
t
go
to
make
much
progress
while
work
toward
improve
management
i
decide
with
john
prescott
that
we
have
to
begin
to
prepare
to
publish
in
case
of
a
strike
by
the
production
department
of
the
paper
accordingly
as
early
as
we
set
in
motion
a
plan
to
train
nonunion
post
personnel
to
run
certain
equipment
necessary
to
print
the
paper
this
be
not
unprecedented
have
be
do
by
several
other
newspaper
what
we
be
try
to
do
be
gain
some
sort
of
parity
at
the
bargaining
table
by
be
able
to
print
the
paper
without
union
labor
in
effect
to
take
a
strike
if
we
have
to
john
prescott
ken
johnson
a
young
night
editor
who
have
cross
over
into
production
and
i
from
the
post
and
jack
kauffmann
and
bin
lewis
of
the
star
agree
each
paper
should
be
prepared
to
publish
in
the
fall
of
if
a
strike
prove
unavoidable
john
then
plan
and
implement
a
training
program
with
ken
johnson
s
help
he
set
up
an
emergency
procedure
committee
that
met
weekly
in
and
sometimes
twice
a
week
we
sent
several
people
to
the
training
center
in
oklahoma
city
sppi
where
jim
cooper
have
once
work
we
rent
a
large
space
in
suburban
washington
where
we
set
up
a
course
in
production
training
all
of
this
be
by
way
of
learn
to
walk
before
we
could
run
and
it
be
all
background
to
what
be
to
happen
that
fall
as
we
enter
the
time
of
year
when
advertising
traditionally
grow
to
its
heaviest
meaning
large
paper
we
also
head
into
the
time
for
the
usual
disaster
when
there
be
more
opportunity
for
the
compose
room
or
the
pressroom
or
the
mailroom
to
hold
up
the
paper
to
harass
management
slowdown
grow
even
more
common
which
meant
that
our
distributor
be
wait
three
and
four
unpaid
hour
our
carrier
be
quit
complaint
be
pour
in
from
subscriber
and
the
printer
and
pressman
be
see
flaunt
their
overtime
paycheck
in
the
face

want
to

idea
of
stranger
run
their
press
and
that
the
men
want
to
come
back
in
to
run
them
john
believe
him
and
let
the
pressman
in
they
invade
the
pressroom
scream
and
yell
about
scab
the
terrify
people
executive
and
advertising
salesman
who
have
be
work
the
press
naturally
flee
at
the
sight
of
the
tough
pressman
who
immediately
sat
down
and
refuse
to
let
anyone
run
the
press
they
slash
a
lot
of
the
blanket
that
surround
the
roller
on
the
press
and
tore
out
all
the
web
stop
the
whole
night
s
work
john
sadly
say
to
dugan
you
told
me
you
be
in
here
to
operate
these
press
well
i
lie
be
dugan
s
simple
response
they
have
us
our
whole
even
s
effort
be
lose
in
effect
we
have
to
surrender
with
only
a
slight
face
saver
we
agree
to
reinstate
padilla
with
just
a
letter
of
reprimand
in
his
file
earnie
smith
our
tough
devote
compose
room
foreman
burst
into
tear
when
told
he
have
to
take
padilla
back
in
return
the
pressman
eventually
ran
off
a
hundred
thousand
or
so
of
the
nonunion
print
paper
after
the
stereotypers
have
scratch
out
the
first
paragraph
in
the
story
describe
our
achievement
and
what
we
have
accomplish
we
have
make
a
serious
mistake
in
let
the
pressman
back
into
the
pressroom
but
amazingly
they
have
print
a
paper
totally
prepared
by
nonunion
labor
and
cold
type
the
wildcat
strike
have
taught
both
the
union
and
management
quite
a
bit
nevertheless
when
the
printer
come
back
to
work
they
resume
slowdown
and
production
disruption
i
go
home
that
morning
at
about
six
tire
and
depressed
and
only
then
do
i
remember
that
i
have
forty
people
come
to
a
black
tie
dinner
that
night
at
my
house
for
the
buffetts
since
i
have
be
up
all
night
i
thought
of
cancel
but
it
seem
easy
to
go
ahead
with
it
warren
still
recall
his
introduction
to
washington
life
sit
between
barbara
bush
and
jane
muskie
we
have
schedule
a
lunch
at
the
post
the
next
day
so
that
warren
could
meet
with
various
people
on
both
the
business
and
editorial
side
of
the
paper
there
be
some
talk
of
acquisition
and
someone
mention
the
problem
of
amortization
of
goodwill
be
a
disadvantage
in
a
company
like
ours
because
of
its
accounting
impact
howard
simon
always
a
delightful
but
mischievous
goad
look
at
me
and
say
now
katharine
how
do
that
amortization
of
goodwill
work
the
conversation
stop
for
a
second
warren
recall
and
i
could
see
this
look
on
your
face
like
he
d
ask
you
to
explain
einstein
s
theory
of
relativity
with
several
corollary
here
be
my
chance
to
be
a
hero
so
i
jumped
in
and
explain
in
a
fairly
succinct
way
how
it
work
when
warren
finish
his
explanation
i
look
at
howard
and
say
exactly
i
think
this
be
the
real
begin
of
my
know
how
much
warren
would
mean
to
me
after
lunch
he
and
i
spent
an
hour
together
during
which
he
offer
to
stop
buying
our
stock
because
he
perceive
it
be
worry
me
he
described
his
bite
of
the
company
as
baby
teeth
but
add
if
they
look
like
wolf
s
fang
i
ll
take
them
out
i
didn
t
even
know
how
to
respond
and
after
some
little
time
i
agree
i
would
like
that
charlie
munger
warren
s
partner
have
suggest
he
wait
one
more
visit
but
warren
be
anxious
not
to
appear
as
a
threat
particularly
since
he
be
hop
for
an
invitation
to
join
our
board
warren
write
me
a
few
day
after
the
lunch
say
when
you
can
obtain
total
participation
by
talented
and
intellectually
diverse
people
without
dilute
authority
and
at
the
same
time
enjoy
yourself
immensely
you
be
achieve
something
with
the
note
he
sent
me
a
box
of
candy
from
see
s
another
company
he
own
and
a
memo
on
amortization
of
goodwill
despite
our
defeat
in
the
wildcat
strike
which
disturbed
me
considerably
the
result
be
not
all
negative
we
have
finally
start
to
address
the
nag
problem
of
the
slowdown
and
we
have
built
up
our
confidence
about
our
ability
to
print
without
the
union
we
knew
and
they
knew
that
we
could
print
we
also
ran
story
say
exactly
what
have
happen
show
a
new
candor
with
our
reader
and
the
union
still
it
remain
a
defeat
the
union
have
won
a
considerable
victory
in
get
padilla
reinstate
and
in
prevent
our
run
the
press
very
significantly
for
the
future
dugan
with
some
reason
saw
himself
as
the
hero
of
the
occasion
and
get
the
idea
that
his
power
be
very
great
that
he
could
call
the
shot
because
he
be
responsible
for
defeat
our
effort
to
publish
the
lesson
seem
to
be
that
if
kick
hard
enough
we
would
give
in
a
dangerous
lesson
dugan
never
stop
test
us
test
me
later
we
ran
a
story
on
union
that
he
consider
unacceptable
and
he
call
me
to
say
that
his
men
wouldn
t
run
the
press
i
told
jim
there
be
only
one
editor
of
the
paper
and
it
be
ben
bradlee
and
he
d
well
print
what
ben
edit
i
must
say
it
end
there
the
aftereffect
of
the
twelve
printer
be
arrest
and
charge
for
stay
in
the
building
also
cause
a
lot
of
grief
there
be
bumper
sticker
all
over
town
save
the
washington
post
i
respond
at
great
length
to
all
of
the
letter
i
receive
many
of
which
imply
that
we
be
embark
on
some
sort
of
irrational
war
and
that
we
be
uncaring
one
of
the
printer
piously
suggest
that
we
be
equate
money
with
success
i
write
him
an
indignant
reply
if
the
management
of
the
washington
post
do
not
equate
profit
with
success
neither
of
us
would
be
here
to
discus
all
the
other
mark
of
success
such
as
the
excellence
of
the
newspaper
we
produce
and
how
we
produce
it
nor
the
welfare
of
all
the
people
do
it
t
he
paper
s
profit
margin
have
come
down
steadily
each
year
since
to
the
point
where
we
have
have
to
make
a
concert
and
determine
effort
to
turn
them
around
as
the
month
wore
on
into
i
be
besiege
by
angry
advertiser
on
the
one
hand
and
unhappy
petulant
union
member
on
the
other
when
we
put
out
the
company
s
annual
report
i
sent
a
letter
to
all
post
employee
say
be
a
pivotal
year
for
the
company
and
that
we
have
to
turn
the
tide
and
begin
to
increase
our
profit
margin
some
of
the
employee
write
me
that
they
found
my
letter
offensive
in
a
speech
to
security
analyst
i
mention
a
goal
of
around
percent
profitability
as
the
norm
for
the
paper
to
get
back
to
not
a
particularly
lofty
goal
especially
since
other
company
routinely
have
profit
margin
of
percent
or
more
the
union
call
this
greedy
and
people
in
the
city
room
most
of
whom
have
little
idea
about
business
or
profit
in
those
day
post
caricature
of
me
as
justice
with
scale
on
one
side
weight
down
with
gold
meanwhile
the
printer
continued
their
slowdown
and
in
late
march
they
reject
by
a
vote
of
to
our
contract
offer
guaranteed
lifetime
job
in
return
for
freedom
to
automate
the
guild
too
be
begin
to
boil
up
over
its
impend
contract
negotiation
we
have
have
some
disastrous
negotiation
with
it
some
of
which
have
little
to
do
with
the
specific
of
any
labor
contract
and
more
to
do
with
grievance
of
minority
and
woman
on
the
staff
and
with
feeling
of
insecurity
among
young
reporter

they
compete
for
space
in
the
paper
and
attention
from
their
editor

the

with
trepidation
brian
flores
have
be
enrage
by
larry
wallace
s
firm
but
patient
method
of
negotiate
something
he
d
never

before
basically
larry
have
say
we
ll
give
you
an
economic
package
of
a
week
and
you
decide
if

not
be
package
when
we
make
our
final
proposal
which
be
both
generous
and
fair
at
a
time
of
wage
and
price
control
and
high
inflation
the
guild
s
bargaining
committee
didn
t
communicate
our
offer
include
a
cost
of
living
increase
to
its
membership
since
brian
have
the
strike
vote
in
hand
he
simply
call
the
strike
i
be
in
detroit
give
a
speech
when
the
guild
struck
i
get
back
that
even
we
decide
to
go
on
publishing
again
use
news
executive
and
guild
exempt
people
this
time
do
the
write
and
edit
the
craft
all
stayed
in
and
perform
their
duty
however
reluctantly
and
in
the
case
of
the
still
negotiate
printer
with
bad
attitude
than
ever
quite
unorthodoxly
the
guild
state
that
it
would
not
put
up
a
picket
line
which
its
leader
felt
would
protect
the
craft
union
from
our
publishing
the
paper
without
them
bob
levey
then
head
of
the
post
s
guild
unit
say
that
the
absence
of
editorial
excellence
would
be
so
noticeable
that
it
would
ultimately
become
an
economic
sanction
itself
i
believe
that
the
real
reason
the
guild
omit
the
picket
line
be
the
fear
that
they
would
then
have
to
stay
out
until
the
typographer
settle
and
this
might
cause
a
much
longer
strike
for
them
but
the
guild
have
pull
all
its
member
out
of
the
building
about
nine
hundred
employee
walk
out
for
the
duration
of
the
strike
we
include
the
editor
and
others
who
be
guild
exempt
by
reason
of
their
job
fill
the
paper
with
wire
service
copy
and
photograph
and
we
all
write
whatever
we
could
since
style
be
the
place
where
wire
service
copy
be
the
least
available
even
i
write
two
story
that
go
in
one
be
about
the
iranian
ambassador
s
sister
homa
homayoun
who
be
a
member
of
parliament
i
interviewed
her
and
pecked
the
story
out
on
my
typewriter
then
meg
and
i
together
interviewed
nancy
kissinger
henry
s
new

who
have
just
come
to
town
we
sat
talk
with
her
on
my
back
terrace
and
afterwards
as
we
start
to
write
up
our
piece
neither
of
us
could
remember
what
she
have
worn
in
order
to
describe
it
ben
need
our
copy
quickly
and
come
up
to
my
office
and
begin
grab
page
from
meg
s
typewriter
and
rush
us
on
we
do
manage
to
finish
it
in
time
and
it
appear
on
the
front
page
of
style
we
all
fill
in
in
other
capacity
too
the
work
for
the
exempt
executive
and
their
staff

hard
and
intense
and

day

some
others

learn
to
take
classify
ad
and
spent
hour
at
it
a
skill
that

even
more
useful
the
follow
year
we
be
stun
at
what
hard
work
it

with
no
letup

new
caller

typewriter
be
then
use
to
fill
in
the
complicate
classify

but
since
my
type
wasn
t
up
to
speed
i
take
the
ad
by
hand
and
give
them
to
someone
else
to

i
try
to
avoid
the

have
long

use
car
dealer
call
in
to
advertise
several
car

one
day
toward
the
end
of
the
strike
i
get
a
mercedes
dealer
on
the
phone
and
everyone
else

struggle
through

overqualified
you
could
be

a
second
before

a
matter
of
fact
i
be
i
later
met
the
dealer
in
person
and
we
laughingly
recall
that
odd
moment
during
one
of
our
long
morning
in
classify
i
heard
ben
ask
meg
when

and
friend
bill
ruane
come
down
during
the
strike
to
look
over
the
company
to
determine
whether
he
too
would
invest
in
the
post
he
write
me
after
his
visit
if
there
be
those
who
have
doubt
about
your
determination
to
make
profit
i
only
wish
they
be
with
me
last
even
your
satisfaction
in
achieve
an
extra
page
of

that

after
the
prize
wall
street
have
to
offer
as
well
for
every
lighter
moment
in
the
strike
however
there
be
an
equally
dark
one
in
the
compose
room
the
hostility
to
editor
turn
physical
men
there
drop
large
pan
of
metal
behind
the
editor
to
make
them
jump
and
flip
the
lead
so
it
hit
them
on
the
head
all
the
while
insert
type
excruciatingly
slowly
while
constantly
look
up
to
ask
what
next
use
crude
language
in
the
hope
of
shock
woman
editor
they
would
also
replace
type
so
instead
of
staff
writer
a
byline
might
read
washington
post
staff
rat
after
two
week
of
grind
work
we
be
all
really
tire
i
believe
there
be
only
seventeen
guild
exempt
editor
at
the
time
the
paper
be
be
put
together
by
them
and
a
few
other
exempt
but
not
regular
writer
or
editor
replace
the
eight
hundred
guild
member
who
be
out
and
who
luckily
be
get
tire
of
sit
at
home
unpaid
there
have
be
a
lot
of
talk
by
the
guild
reporter
about
remove
their
excellence
unfortunately
for
them
and
for
me
who
care
so
deeply
about
editorial
importance
and
quality
their
excellence
be
remarkably
unmissed
during
the
guild
strike
a
majority
of
post
reader
accord
to
a
star
survey
say
there
be
no
change
in
the
paper
of
those
who
notice
a
change
a
majority
thought
the
post
be
well
despite
some
of
the
inferior
material
and
wire
service
copy
with
which
we
necessarily
fill
the
paper
many
people
didn
t
realize
the
paper
be
on
strike
at
all
a
rude
awaken
for
both
the
guild
and
us
the
guild
have
genuinely
thought
we
couldn
t
get
the
paper
out
without
them
but
we
prove
that
we
could
and
we
do
editorially
we
have
produce
a
paper
each
day
without
the
guild
s
excellence
but
a
perfectly
acceptable
paper
nevertheless
the
sunday
paper
on
the
day
the
striker
come
back
to
work
turn
out
to
have
the
post
s
large
classify
section
ever
the
guild
have
sent
out
a
letter
from
its
chairman
say
to
hang
tough
many
member
be
say
they
don
t
understand
why
the
good
old
washington
post
and
particularly
mr
graham
doesn
t
move
to
make
us
a
fair
offer
the
answer
be
that
the
gowp
doesn
t
exist
any
more
he
go
on
to
urge
them
to
ask
their
friend
and
neighbor
to
cancel
their
subscription
to
the
post
the
guild
leader
also
sent
letter
to
advertiser
accuse
us
of
be
politically
liberal
while
not
provide
decent
wage
hour
and
work
condition
to
counter
this
kind
of
propaganda
we
sent
our
offer
directly
to
the
guild
member
home
so
that
we
could
be
assure
that
they
and
their
spouse
would
know
what
it
be
we
be
offering
when
people
read
it
they
be
furious
with
flores
for
say
that
there
be
no
cost
of
living
increase
negotiation
be
resume
after
the
offer
be
sent
out
finally
on
april
after
an
intense
all
night
bargaining
session
the
guild
accepted
by
a
vote
of
to
a
contract
not
substantially
different
from
our
original
offer
and
agree
to
return
to
work
the
next
day
we
be
all
exhaust
but
happy
to
have
the
strike
over
and
the
guild
return
every
afternoon
around
six
throughout
the
strike
there
have
be
a
gathering
in
my
office
for
a
drink
before
dinner
which
we
be
serve
on
the
ninth
floor
of
the
post
as
the
news
of
this
opportunity
have
spread
the
number
of
drinker
have
grown
so
there
be
a
huge
gathering
of
relieve
people
on
the
night
of
the
guild
vote
to
return
before
i
knew
it
we
have
all
form
a
big
circle
in
the
outer
office
lou
limber
one
of
the
great
advertising
executive
be
greek
and
he
lead
us
in
a
pathetic
version
of
the
dance
from
the
movie
never
on
sunday
with
lou
and
me
in
the
center
of
the
circle
i
with
a
handkerchief
grasped
tightly
between
my
teeth
know
we
have
to
put
out
one
more
paper
most
of
us
finally
repair
to
the
din
room
though
a
few
stayed
behind
and
carry
on
drinking
in
the
middle
of
dinner
mary
lou
beatty
national
editor
approach
me
hesitantly
and
say
mr

i
m
sorry
to
tell
you
that
buddy
humphries
fell
straight
over
into
your
ficus
tree
which
exists
no
more
the
even
be
well
worth
the
sacrifice
of
the
ficus
tree
and
bud
be
still
an
excellent
ad
salesman
certainly
there
be
those
who
resent
prescott
and
wallace
and
me
and
the
drive
to
make
the
paper
profitable
many
of
the
young
guild
member
be
just
begin
to
mature
at
that
time
and
have
little
comprehension
of
either
management
or
business
to
a
lot
of
them
there
be
something
dirty
about
profit
and
something
greedy
about
those
seek
profit
they
have
no
idea
of
what
be
need
to
maintain
and
grow
a
business
healthy
enough
to
pay
their
substantial
salary
and
benefit
this
attitude
encourage
by
the
union
leader
distressed
me
profoundly
what
i
myself
saw
as
the
underpinnings
of
the
strike
be
that
people
be
be
well
paid
but
poorly
manage
and
poorly
communicate
with
the
end
of
the
guild
strike
be
gratify
for
us
but
not
to
be
enjoy
for
long
just
as
it
be
occur
joe
allbritton
arrive
in
town
to
buy
the
star
strike
fear
in
my
heart
for
quite
a
few
year
the
star
have
be
go
downhill
as
early
as
january
a
lengthy
article
have
appear
in
the
washingtonian
magazine
entitle
the
even
star
the
good
grey
lady
be
no
and
not
really
try
harder
but
in
april
of
allbritton
the
wealthy
texan
know
then
and
now
as
a
brilliant
deal
maker
bought
the
paper
from
jack
kauffmann
and
the
three
family
who
own
it
jack
also
sell
him
a
valuable
television
station
in
washington
as
well
as
two
others
in
charleston
and
lynchburg
the
paper
to
be
sure
be
lose
money
but
the
station
be
immensely
valuable
though
the
washington
star
company
be
clearly
ail
joe
represent
an
infusion
of
vitality
into
our
principal
competitor
not
to
mention
an
equally
important
infusion
of
new
money
and
resource
with
his
vast
wealth
joe
have
brain
and
great
charm
as
well
in
true
southern
tradition
he
call
on
us
at
the
post
right
away
although
the
reinvigorate
competition
worried
me
i
actually
believe
it
be
healthy
joe
be
a
rival
to
be
respect
and
fear
but
i
try
to
and
do
remain
on
friendly
term
with
him
i
write
a
friend
joe
be
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happen
i
know
he
be
able
dedicate
and
decent
and
that
we
will
have
lot
more
competition
than
we
ve
have
in
the
past
indeed
joe
do
give
us
some
tougher
competition
at
least
for
a
while
i
be
so
nervous
about
it
that
i
would
show
warren
star
box
on
certain
street
in
the
suburb
more
numerous
to
my
nervous
eye
than
post
box
warren
often
tease
me
about
my
hysterical
worry
why
look
at
audit
bureau
of
circulation
figure
show
the
post
ahead
warren
would
ask
when
we
can
worry
about
the
number
of
star
box
on
this
street
happily
for
me
warren
be
more
on
the
scene
now
and
far
from
a
threat
be
turn
out
to
be
a
good
friend
and
valuable
adviser
he
give
me
add
assurance
about
so
many
thing
that
worried
me
and
he
give
me
broader
vision
by
the
spring
of
warren
be
send
me
a
constant
flow
of
helpful
memo
with
advice
and
occasionally
alert
me
to
problem
of
which
i
be
unaware
in
the
begin
i
didn
t
realize
how
fortunate
i
be
to
have
this
mentor
but
i
grow
very
dependent
on
his
advice
and
like
it
in
effect
he
be
begin
to
teach
me
the
fundamental
of
think
about
business
for
which
i
have
so
long
warren
be
always
very
patient
with
me
particularly
since
as
time
go
on
i
start
to
call
him
two
or
three
time
a
day
sometimes
worry
him
with
the
small
detail
of
my
life
as
well
as
with
the
large
issue
of
the
company
nonetheless
he
be
invariably
kind
wise
funny
and
helpful
and
he
be
always
there
for
me
we
be
get
to
know
each
other
well
all
the
time
and
we
enjoy
each
other
s
company
enormously
as
warren
and
i
start
to
spend
more
and
more
time
together
people
s
eyebrow
shot
up
and
i
be
young
enough
then
for
our
relationship
to
become
quite
an
issue
and
indeed
he
be
eternally
interest
and
fun
to
be
with
at
glen
welby
over
one
weekend
when
he
and
susie
come
to
visit
warren
and
i
take
long
walk
through
the
farm
s
field
in
cross
the
back
field
i
inadvertently
found
myself
nearly
knee
deep
in
a
bog
that
have
collect
from
the
rain
warren
later
sent
me
a
boy
scout
manual
with
a
note
say
it
didn
t
cover
such
advanced
subject
as
exactly
how
far
one
should
march
into
a
bog
before
reassess
one
s
position
a
rather
severe
oversight
in
what
purport
to
be
a
definitive
work
in
late
june
i
combine
an
analyst
meeting
in
los
angeles
with
a
visit
to
warren
and
susie
at
their
house
in
laguna
beach
warren
s
family
be
convulse
with
laughter
about
my
visit
because
warren
who
theretofore
have
never
be
know
to
go
near
the
water
despite
have
vacation
in
laguna
since
actually
bought
a
beach
umbrella
and
swimsuit
so
as
to
make
my
visit
more
enjoyable
he
later
say
this
be
the
source
of
enormous
merriment
in
our
house
because
of
this
incredible
compare
to
what
my
family
be
use
to
standard
of
flexibility
i
would
show
around
you
the
visit
be
an
intense
and
happy
two
day
during
which
he
and
i
talk
about
many
thing
include
the
possibility
of
his
come
on
the
board
of
the
washington
post
company
earlier
that
year
tom
murphy
the
very
able
chairman
of
capital
city
a
broadcasting
and
print
company
then
probably
the
best
run
in
the
business
and
a
friend
of
warren
s
have
ask
why
i
hadn
t
invite
warren
to
be
a
member
of
the
board
note
that
he
want
him
for
his
own
board
but
that
warren
be
hold
out
to
be
ask
by
the
post
the
very
idea
be
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
to
me
it
be
the
first
clue
i
have
that
anything
of
the
kind
be
on
warren
s
mind
i
felt
dense
for
not
have
understood
myself
that
warren
want
to
be
on
the
board
but
i
be
unsure
of
how
to
go
about
it
or
even
if
it
be
desirable
and
if
it
be
how
it
would
be
view
by
the
other
director
my
reaction
reveals
how
truly
at
sea
i
be
and
how
little
i
knew
about
my
new
job
as
chairman
of
the
company
when
the
issue
of
the
board
surface
during
my
visit
i
say
i
want
it
to
happen
but
be
wait
for
the
right
time
to
which
warren
uncharacteristically
impatient
reply
what
be
the
right
time
it
be
then
that
i
realize
i
have
be
afraid
to
cross
the
bridge
and
need
to
do
it
so
i
suggest
that
the
next
meeting
of
the
board
in
september
would
be
a
good
time
and
we
agree
as
warren
be
drive
me
back
to
the
los
angeles
airport
i
told
him
something
very
important
to
me
i
say
i
would
welcome
anything
he
want
to
tell
me
if
he
told
me
gently
but
that
i
didn
t
respond
well
to
sharp
rebuke
which
make
me
curl
up
in
an
angry
retreat
so
i
hop
that
any
criticism
from
him
would
be
deliver
accordingly
i
need
not
have
worried
he
understood
me
totally
by
then
after
the
visit
i
write
him
a
letter
that
express
the
relationship
we
have
grown
into
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
our
friendship
and
clearly
register
the
begin
of
warren
s
direct
influence
on
me
and
on
the
company
i
feel
strangely
as
though
we
have
be
together
several
week
we
talk
so
much
cover
so
much
ground
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
we
laugh
so
much
and
have
so
much
fun
to
start
with
the
latter
i
love
get
to
know
you
both
in
that
special
way
that
come
only
with
see
people
on
their
own
terrain
up
until
now
it
s
always
be
in
my
native
habitat
i
tremendously
enjoy
the
role
change
you
be
both
so
different
from
any
two
individual
i
ve
ever
know
that
i
ve
be
quite
discombobulate
until
now
when
phil
and
i
be
first
married
my
sister
ask
him
a
series
of
question
where
be
he
born
south
dakota
where
do
he
grow
up
florida
and
michigan
where
do
he
go
to
school
miami
public
school
and
the
univ
of
fla
my
god
she
say
you
re
the
backbone
of
the
country
i
don
t
necessarily
place
you
on
the
backbone
but
you
be
such
singular
product
of
this
country
you
could
only
have
happen
here
in
all
the
world
it
s
what
i
love
about
the
us
of
a
and
the
life
in
general
the
surprising
the
unique
the
individual
not
to
get
too
goopy
if
i
have
a
religion
it
s
this
the
judeo
christian
civilization
be
found
on
that
sanctity
of
the
individual
it
lead
to
all
sort
of
other
thing
it
lead
for
beginner
to
democracy
and
to
the
shape
of
this
kind
of
democratic
society
and
it
lead
to
some
sort
of
rationale
i
can
live
with
about
the
goal
of
each
individual
be
to
fulfill
the
unique
potential
within
and
do
it
to
the
utmost
this
be
what
you
do
warren
or
you
be
in
the
process
of
do
your
intensity
concentration
and
drive
almost
scare
me
but
be
luckily
and
happily
relieve
by
those
other
thing
you
also
posse
decency
gaiety
enjoyment
and
warmth
so
many
moment
occur
to
me
as
the
best
but
i
have
to
come
down
on
breakfast
as
the
big
winner
it
be
also
strangely
symbolic
the
first
morning
everyone
be
on
their
company
manner
susie
be
flip
egg
around
or
into
the
sink
as
if
she
have
never
do
anything
else
in
her
life
you
be
make
excessively
fake

good
hearty
send
off
to
the
day
thank
god
we
only
have
to
go
through
one
charade
before
susie
make
no
bone
about
sleep
walk
you
revert
to
ovaltine
by
the
spoon
and
i
plow
my
way
happily
and
undeterred
through
several
course
recite
endless
biographical
chapter
in
between
slice
of
delicious
fatten
bacon
the
long
hour
of

start
so
many
new
train
of
thought
alter

i
already
have
and
redirect

long
to
resume

and

some
of
my

love
o
kay
in
his
response
warren
promise
to
be
helpful
in
any
way
he
could
which
meant
he
would
be
honest
with
me
as
he
say
if
that
require
criticize
how
you
handle
q
and
a
or
anything
else
i
will
be
critical
always
in
private
and
very
gently
on
september
both
warren
and
don
graham
go
on
the
board
of
the
washington
post
company
no
two
people
be
of
more
help
to
me
over
the
next
several
year
and
i
need
all
the
help
i
could
get
with
most
thing
regard
the
business
side
of
the
company
i
still
felt
uncomfortable
fragile
and
vulnerable
here
warren
really
go
to
work
on
me
my
business
education
begin
in
earnest
he
literally
take
me
to
business
school
which
be
just
what
i
need
how
lucky
i
be
to
be
educate
to
the
extent
possible
by
warren
buffett
and
how
many
people
would
have
give
anything
for
the
same
experience
it
be
hard
work
for
both
of
us
warren
admit
i
need
what
he
call
a
little
remedial
work
but
absolutely
vital
for
me
warren
saw
that
i
be
uncomfortable
with
the
nomenclature
and
language
of
business
he
later
told
me
that
i
have
a
kind
of
priesthood
approach
to
business
and
seem
to
feel
that
if
i
hadn
t
study
latin
and
all
that
i
couldn
t
make
it
into
the
priesthood
he
didn
t
ask
me
to
take
anything
on
faith
but
take
out
his
pencil
and
explain
thing
clearly
he
saw
that
it
would
be
helpful
if
we
demystify
a
lot
of
what
we
be
talk
about
so
he
brought
with
him
to
our
meeting
as
many
annual
report
as
he
could
carry
and
take
me
through
them
describe
different
kind
of
business
illustrate
his
main
point
with
real
world
company
note
why
one
be
a
good
business
and
another
bad
teach
me
specific
in
the
process
of
impart
a
great
deal
of
his
highly
developed
philosophy
he
told
me
that
whereas
otis
chandler
collect
antique
car
he
himself
collect
antique
financial
statement
because
just
as
with
geography
or
human
it
be
interest
to
take
a
snapshot
of
a
business
at
widely
different
point
in
time
and
reflect
on
what
factor
produce
change
as
well
as
what
differentiates
the
specific
pattern
of
development
from
others
also
observe
warren
be
a
great
teacher
and
his
lesson
take
i
told
him
it
seem
really
possible
that
i
might
end
up
able
to
add
in
which
case
the
empire
might
either
collapse
altogether
or
i
might
really
get
to
be
the
most
powerful
woman
in
whatever
it
be
trilby
with
svengali
lurk
close
behind
though
i
didn
t
learn
as
much
as
i
would
have
like
i
be
come
from
such
a
deficit
of
knowledge
that
i
nevertheless
learn
a
great
deal
among
other
thing
he
impressed
upon
me
that
it
be
well
to
be
a
bad
manager
of
a
good
business
than
a
good
manager
of
a
bad
business
actually
what
warren
favor
be
good
manager
of
good
business
but
i
get
his
point
one
day
some
week
after
we
d
start
on
my
course
of
study
warren
mail
me
the
back
of
an
annual
report
from
the
disney
company
which
picture
a
child
in
a
stroller
at
the
end
of
a
day
at
disneyland
obviously
completely
wipe
out
his
head
to
one
side
fast
asleep
this
be
you
after
the
th
annual
report
warren
have
scribble
on
it
i
think
i
be
a
dutiful
and
diligent
student
but
as
warren
say
i
didn
t
feel
that
i
d
hit
the
mother
lode
in
term
of
interest
forever
on
it
it
be
more
like
someone
from
a
strongly
religious
family
go
to
hebrew
school
or
something
because
one
felt
it
have
to
be
do
warren
s
take
me
under
his
wing
be
difficult
for
the
top
executive
in
the
company
who
have
their
own
problem
and
possibly
be
a
bit
intimidate
by
the
new
kid
on
the
block
and
how
much
attention
i
be
pay
to
him
i
may
have
view
warren
as
pygmalion
in
term
of
his
have
see
in
me
underdeveloped
resource
but
others
at
least
initially
consider
him
a
rasputin
try
to
manipulate
me
or
perhaps
try
to
run
the
company
through
me
there
be
some
sexism
in
this
attitude
too
tom
murphy
could
consult
warren
and
no
one
question
him
but
if
i
consult
him
it
seem
to
be
something
threaten
and
sinister
i
have
always
have
a
compulsive
plainspokenness
but
i
soon
realize
that
the
word
warren
think
be
pure
poison
on
the
other
hand
i
knew
it
be
transparent
that
on
subject
have
to
do
with
wall
street
and
finance
my
view
have
to
have
derive
from
talk
with
him
but
the
longer
warren
be
on
the
board
the
more
everyone
grow
to
like
him
and
accept
him
several
other
director
go
to
him
for
advice
and
several
become
friend
of
his
as
well
to
me
warren
be
a
man
who
love
business
especially
the
newspaper
business
he
be
a
friend
who
didn
t
have
a
lot
of
spin
to
put
on
our
relationship
he
and
his
style
be
exactly
what
i
need
i
be
learn
but
have
fun
at
the
same
time
learn
and
laugh
my
favorite
combination
once
on
a
trip
he
and
i
take
together
to
nebraska
he
hand
me
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
told
me
to
draw
a
map
of
the
united
state
and
put
omaha
on
it
i
begin
bravely
with
maine
and
get
as
far
as
delaware
and
then
it
start
to
get
a
little
vague
however
i
get
my
contour
all
down
and
then
try
to
place
nebraska
inside
it
look
like
one
of
those
map
of
america
drawn
at
the
time
of
columbus
warren
start
to
pocket
it
but
i
knew
well
than
to
leave
that
around
and
grabbed
it
back
on
this
same
trip
we
stop
in
for
a
more
or
less
spur
of
the
moment
visit
to
the
omaha
world
herald
the
pressure
of
see
warren
and
me
together
start
such
wild
rumor
of
sale
that
peter
kiewit
the
owner
immediately
publicize
the
arrangement
he
have
already
make
for
tie
up
the
newspaper
in
a
trust
in
order
to
prevent
any
such
takeover
i
also
have
gotten
great
pleasure
from
warren
s
partner
charlie
munger
who
come
from
omaha
originally
too
his
voice
and
superficial
mannerism
be
amazingly
like
warren
s
he
found
the
law
firm
of
munger
tolles
olson
but
have
spent
more
time
as
an
investor
and
as
warren
s
partner
to
the
intense
amusement
of
both
of
them
i
make
an
endure
and
please
impression
on
charlie
by
solemnly
take
note
like
a
schoolgirl
at
the
foot
of
the
great
professor
when
i
go
to
talk
with
him
about
investment
since
among
other
thing
i
now
have
the
responsibility
for
family
trust
one
of
charlie
s
typical
bons
mot
be
his
say
that
he
frequently
reminds
warren
that
the
main
risk
we
face
as
we
scrabble
on
be
not
go
broke
but
go
crazy
warren
s
family
have
always
be
amuse
at
the
clash
of
our
two
culture
our
life
have
progress
along
almost
polar
opposite
line
yet
we
have
so
much
in
common
in
many
way
we
have
influence
each
other
deeply
although
warren
s
effect
on
my
life
be
central
to
everything
that
follow
while
mine
on
his
be
largely
peripheral
fairly
early
on
i
write
charlie
munger
about
this
mutual
influence
who
be
go
to
influence
whom
in
the
new
association
warren
may
have
enter
the
ocean
in
california
but
i
be
sit
down
in
virginia
with
ben
graham
s
beginner
s
book
and
how
to
read
a
financial
report
by
someone
call
merrill
lynch
pierce
fenner
and
smith
i
be
told
i
have
to
finish
ben
graham
very
soon
because
warren
be
unwilling
to
pay
the
small
fine
involve
in
have
the
book
out
of
the
omaha
public
library
too
long
i
believe
my
effect
on
warren
have
mostly
be
limited
to
his
life
style
i
like
to
think
that
i
have
something
to
do
with
his
improve
eat
habit
as
well
as
his
attire
before
he
met
me
junk
food
peanut
ice
cream
or
ham
sandwich
for
breakfast
be
the
norm
hamburger
and
steak
constitute
nearly
the
entire
range
of
his
other
taste
dinner
at
my
house
help
him
to
venture
a
little
far
afield
warren
later
say
you
handle
me
at
the
dinner
table
like
i
handle
you
at
the
accounting
book
we
both
recall
with
great
mirth
one
dinner
when
he
bravely
attack
a
lobster
the
like
of
which
he
d
never
see
before
he
do
a
bit
well
when
i
tactfully
suggest
that
he
turn
it
over
and
try
it
from
the
right
side
he
later
admit
that
but
for
your
help
i
might
still
have
be
there
week
later
try
to
go
through
on
the
totally
impenetrable
wrong
side
of
that
sea
creature
i
introduce
him
to
the
possibility
that
a
steady
diet
of
fast
food
and
cherry
coke
might
not
be
the
best
for
him
or
even
a
steady
stream
of
all
white
shirt
i
may
also
have
influence
his
spending
habit
to
some
extent
he
be
parsimonious
in
the
extreme
once
when
we
be
together
at
an
airport
i
ask
him
for
a
dime
to
make
a
phone
call
he
start
to
walk
some
distance
to
get
change
for
a
quarter
warren
i
exclaim
the
quarter
will
do
and
he
sheepishly
hand
it
over
beyond
acquaint
him
with
a
few
new
food
and
slightly
more
varied
clothing
i
also
introduce
him
to
a
wide
variety
of
people
in
journalism
and
government
in
my
early
year
of
know
him
i
be
convince
that
warren
s
gift
be
so
extraordinary
that
he
like
my
father
and
my
husband
would
eventually
tire
of
make
money
and
want
to
perform
public
service
and
be
engage
in
world
event
in
this
i
misjudge
him
what
he
love
be
business
think
and
reading
and
talk
about
business
he
be
acute
about
public
issue
but
i
can
t
imagine
him
in
government
warren
be
only
happy
when
he
be
unconstrained
totally
in
control
of
his
own
life
not
force
to
go
to
meeting
or
dinner
he
doesn
t
want
to
go
to
or
see
people
who
don
t
interest
him
or
do
thing
he
doesn
t
enjoy
warren
have
do
so
many
thing
for
me
but
among
the
most
important
be
the
inroad
he
have
make
on
my
insecurity
just
as
ben
have
always
reassure
me
on
the
editorial
side
of
the
post
warren
with
his
store
of
analogy
and
anecdote
buffettisms
i
call
them
and
his
constant
bolster
be
very
comfort
to
me
early
in
our
friendship
i
write
him
that
i
didn
t
know
when
i
heard
from
you
that
you
have
become
a
large
holder
of
washington
post
stock
that
although
your
dividend
might
not
make
you
rich
my
dividend
in
psychic
income
would
triple
warren
not
only
know
business
but
he
know
the
communication
business
in
a
way
that
i
didn
t
then
and
don
t
now
he
never
calm
me
down
by
false
optimism
but
rather
by
shed
the
light
of
reality
as
he
saw
it
on
whatever
it
be
that
be
haunt
me
he
be
always
accessible
almost
like
have
a
personal
business
psychiatrist
warren
be
humanly
wise
too
so
naturally
i
begin
to
share
with
him
thing
in
my
private
life
his
comment
always
help
one
day
i
call
him
because
i
have
be
hurt
by
a
friend
don
t
forget
he
told
me
she
have
zero
base
affection
meaning
that
you
always
have
to
start
from
scratch
with
no
reservoir
of
goodwill
or
of
love
he
knew
me
so
well
that
he
instinctively
knew
what
might
work
with
me
he
once
told
me
that
someone
in
a
dale
carnegie
course
have
say
to
him
just
remember
we
re
not
go
to
teach
you
how
to
keep
your
knee
from
knock
all
we
re
go
to
do
be
teach
you
to
talk
while
your
knee
knock
that
s
what
he
then
turn
around
and
pass
on
to
me
he
help
me
learn
how
to
talk
while
my
knee
knock
warren
sum
up
our
learn
relationship
by
suggest
that
i
seem
to
go
around
as
though
i
be
see
myself
through
the
distort
mirror
of
a
carnival
fun
house
he
saw
it
as
his
task
to
get
me
a
well
mirror
that
could
eliminate
the
distortion
he
later
told
me
that
he
subscribed
to
charlie
munger
s
orangutan
theory
which
essentially
contend
that
if
a
smart
person
go
into
a
room
with
an
orangutan
and
explains
whatever
his
or
her
idea
be
the
orangutan
just
sits
there
eat
his
banana
and
at
the
end
of
the
conversation
the
person
explain
come
out
smarter
warren
claimed
to
be
my
orangutan
and
in
a
way
he
be
i
heard
myself
talk
when
i
be
with
him
and
i
always
get
a
well
idea
of
what
i
be
say
at
about
the
same
time
that
warren
come
on
the
board
several
thing
heat
up
within
the
company
particularly
on
the
labor
front
we
have
experienced
a
nightmare
spring
when
the
star
have
decide
to
conduct
separate
bargaining
meeting
with
the
printer
and
have
arrive
at
a
separate
settlement
with
the
itu
which
be
a
serious
break
in
our
unity
and
one
that
very
much
disturbed
me
our
summer
have
be
as
bad
as
our
spring
with
work
stoppage
and
problem
from
both
the
pressman
and
the
printer
negotiation
with
the
printer
have
broken
down
in
the
face
of
many
of
their
frivolous
demand
like
ask
for
a
holiday
for
my
birthday
and
then
claim
we
weren
t
bargaining
in
good
faith
if
we
wouldn
t
discus
it
at
the
table
eventually
on
september
after
fourteen
month
of
agonize
on
again
off
again
tough
bargaining
the
post
and
the
printer
finally
sign
a
six
year
contract
this
be
a
watershed
document
that
permit
gradual
automation
in
the
compose
room
and
give
seven
hundred
post
printer
lifetime
job
we
have
the
right
to
reduce
that
number
through
attrition
and
buyout
most
important
the
contract
end
the
practice
of
reproduce
which
by
this
time
have
mount
to
the
point
where
the
perpage
cost
accrual
be
we
paid
about
million
to
member
of
the
union
to
get
rid
of
the
bogus
ominously
for
the
future
john
prescott
report
on
a
conversation
he
have
with
charlie
davis
of
the
stereotypers
union
who
say
that
if
he
have
be
a
printer
he
would
never
have
give
up
reproduce
the
rest
of
us
however
be
ecstatic
it
be
a
landmark
occasion
and
another
essential
and
giant
step
forward
john
prescott
deserves
great
credit
for
the
final
settlement
with
the
itu
which
we
have
be
strive
for
for
year
it
be
expensive
in
that
we
have
to
guarantee
hundred
of
job
which
have
no
reason
for
exist
in
the
first
place
the
new
york
paper
have
set
this
precedent
but
it
be
fair
to
both
side
most
significantly
it
get
rid
of
the
bad
problem
that
confront
us
and
the
bad
run
sore
in
our
side
the
constant
confrontation
with
animosity
from
and
slowdown
by
the
printer
which
in
turn
help
us
allay
the
potentially
disastrous
discontent
brewing
with
the
circulation
dealer
most
of
the
dealer
like
our
system
of
their
be
independent
business
the
system
paid
them
well
and
there
be
healthy
incentive
as
long
as
they
didn
t
have
to
cope
with
the
problem
of
the
long
wait
result
from
the
slowdown
but
now
the
dissident
among
the
dealer
create
a
new
threat
for
us
they
want
to
set
their
own
price
for
the
paper
we
met
this
danger
by
work
out
a
deal
that
convert
the
dealer
to
an
agency
system
whereby
they
get
paid
for
distribution
of
our
paper
which
we
not
they
own
the
incentive
remain
good
in
a
way
that
be
both
fair
and
profitable
for
them
this
practice
too
be
accepted
and
the
agency
form
of
organization
be
actually
picked
up
and
copy
by
other
paper
give
these
success
it
would
seem
as
though
john
prescott
have
a
solid
record
but
in
fact
it
be
mixed
i
continued
to
think
that
we
be
not
make
enough
progress
and
there
be
still
a
lack
of
firmness
with
the
union
with
some
reluctance
together
with
larry
israel
who
have
be
president
of
the
company
since
fritz
s
death
i
decide
that
we
need
a
strong
hand
at
the
helm
at
the
post
with
the
acquisition
of
the
trenton
time
which
we
have
make
earlier
in
and
the
hop
for
acquisition
of
other
paper
we
promote
john
prescott
to
head
of
the
newspaper
division
which
we
establish
to
include
our
share
of
the
international
herald
tribune
our
newsprint
manufacturer
bowater
mersey
the
news
service
and
our
newsprint
warehouse
we
also
brought
mark
meagher
down
from
new
york
where
he
have
be
base
since
mid
serve
the
company
as
vice
president
for
finance
and
administration
he
now
become
executive
vice
president
and
general
manager
of
the
post
reporting
directly
to
me
as
publisher
our
timing
couldn
t
have
be
bad
come
as
it
do
on
the
very
day
we
be
to
ratify
the
new
contract
with
the
printer
union
i
get
a
fair
amount
of
flak
over
the
decision
about
prescott
but
it
be
make
as
always
with
enough
consensus
from
those
whose
judgment
i
trust
that
i
felt
it
be
right
so
mark
meagher
take
up
the
rein
on
the
business
side
of
the
post
what
he
found
be
ill
will
throughout
the
building
and
low
morale
among
the
middle
manager
because
of
personnel
change
on
the
whole
the
union
regard
management
as
incompetent
yet
able
enough
to
try
deviously
to
set
them
up
as
scapegoat
for
all
of
the
problem
that
could
more
clearly
be
laid
at
management
s
own
door
mark
be
relatively
new
to
newspapering
but
learn
fast
and
do
a
fine
job
begin
right
away
to
get
thing
in
well
shape
he
work
hard
on
labor
issue
and
trust
larry
wallace
to
keep
a
steady
hand
on
the
rudder
larry
be
a
first
rate
negotiator
but
for
year
he
take
incredible
heat
for
be
tough
and
fearless
in
bargaining
session
mark
do
very
well
too
in
both
labor
relation
and
in
equal
employment
in
promote
and
hire
woman
and
minority
and
bring
a
renew
vigor
to
the
business
side
of
the
paper
but
the
pressman
particularly
be
give
us
a
lot
of
problem
what
it
come
down
to
be
that
after
year
of
concession
to
their
union
of
deal
make
over
the
water
cooler
of
surrenderings
in
order
to
avoid
a
strike
at
all
cost
we
be
no
longer
in
control
of
our
own
pressroom
we
knew
that
to
move
forward
we
have
to
regain
control
and
in
order
to
do
that
we
have
to
eliminate
some
of
the
more
excessive
clause
and
featherbed
that
reduce
productivity
tie
our
hand
prevent
us
from
manage
the
future
of
the
paper
and
threaten
the
economic
well
be
of
the
post
accordingly
early
in
we
inform
the
pressman
s
local
that
in
our
negotiation
toward
a
new
contract
we
would
insist
on
revision
of
those
practice
as
wore
on
we
retrain
executive
in
all
the
production
process
need
if
we
be
ever
force
to
publish
without
the
craft
union
many
of
those
who
have
go
to
oklahoma
city
for
the
original
training
have
not
take
it
very
seriously
now
we
sent
several
people
down
to
the
miami
herald
to
brush
up
on
their
production
skill
on
september
mark
and
i
go
to
call
on
joe
allbritton
who
by
then
be
acquaint
with
the
lay
of
the
land
at
the
star
we
hop
he
would
understand
the
importance
of
stick
together
for
the
pressman
s
union
negotiation
as
i
put
it
to
joe
in
this
meeting
if
we
have
to
settle
with
the
pressman
it
would
undoubtedly
affect
the
star
s
situation
in
the
long
run
not
surprisingly
joe
turn
us
down
say
he
could
not
afford
to
spend
another
fifty
cent
with
the
star
lose
a
million
dollar
a
month
at
the
time
he
be
probably
right
but
it
seem
shortsighted
to
me
after
this
i
thought
about
our
undergo
a
strike
while
the
other
paper
be
publishing
and
conclude
that
we
couldn
t
win
largely
because
no
one
ever
have
if
the
other
paper
publish
advertiser
have
a
way
to
reach
people
and
the
struck
paper
simply
would
wither
on
the
vine
unless
of
course
it
could
continue
to
publish
i
conclude
that
we
would
be
operating
at
such
a
tremendous
disadvantage
that
we
couldn
t
possibly
take
a
strike
at
this
time
without
endanger
the
paper
s
existence
it
certainly
be
a
bad
time
for
a
strike
the
star
be
gain
momentum
allbritton
be
a
fast
learner
and
as
warren
buffett
recall
a
strike
at
the
post
be
his
sole
hope
really
if
you
own
the
star
warren
suggest
the
way
you
be
go
to
win
be
to
have
the
post
shut
down
if
not
you
be
go
to
lose
if
allbritton
prayed
for
anything
he
prayed
for
you
not
publishing
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
while
people
developed
different
reading
habit
in
my
discussion
with
mark
in
the
late
summer
and
early
fall
of
i
told
him
not
to
get
us
into
a
situation
where
we
risk
a
strike
i
be
clear
in
say
that
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
extend
the
contract
for
a
year
or
make
yet
another
short
run
deal
than
to
take
a
strike
alone
mark
point
out
that
we
be
not
negotiate
with
the
union
over
strike
issue
but
that
we
have
ask
our
supervisor
to
start
manage
and
we
have
to
back
them
up
with
measure
that
would
permit
them
to
do
that
we
agree
to
live
with
most
of
our
contract
rule
a
while
longer
to
settle
for
a
single
contract
change
or
two
in
order
to
show
that
change
be
come
but
to
try
to
avoid
a
strike
contract
with
nine
of
the
craft
union
include
the
pressman
who
by
now
have
combine
with
the
stereotypers
be
all
schedule
to
run
out
on
october
we
approach
that
date
fully
expect
a
tough
time
and
long
negotiation
what
we
get
be
the
unexpected
chapter
twenty
six
very
early
in
the
morning
of
october
i
be
awaken
out
of
a
sound
sleep
by
the
loud
ring
of
the
phone
next
to
my
bed
groggily
i
look
at
the
clock
as
i
reach
for
the
phone
and
be
mystify
it
be
about
a
m
what
could
it
mean
we
have
fear
the
midnight
deadline
when
the
contract
between
the
washington
post
and
its
union
be
set
to
expire
in
fact
i
d
be
so
worried
that
i
have
return
early
to
washington
from
meeting
in
florida
i
phone
mark
meagher
when
i
get
back
should
i
come
to
the
paper
no
he
reply
everything
be
quiet
all
the
executive
would
be
there
in
case
anything
happen
there
be
every
indication
that
the
negotiation
would
continue
beyond
the
deadline
so
i
go
to
bed
think
that
if
midnight
come
and
go
with
no
problem
both
side
would
carry
on
with
the
back
and
forth
bargaining
my
phone
call
be
from
mark
the
pressman
have
pearl
harbor
us
run
the
press
past
midnight
to
throw
us
off
about
their
intention
and
then
at
about
a
m
just
before
the
end
of
the
pressrun
disable
all
seventy
two
printing
unit
of
the
nine

do
severe
damage
in
a
variety
of
way
include
set
fire
to
one
press
and
brutally
beating
the
pressroom
foreman
jim
hover
who
have
come
out
of
his
office
to
see
what
be
slow
the
press
the
pressman
local
of
the
newspaper
and
graphic
communication
union
walk
out
take
with
them
the
other
craft
union
and
start
picket
there
be
no
time
to
think
i
dress
hastily
jumped
in
the
car
without
wake
my
driver
who
live
nearby
and
drove
myself
down
quiet
dark
massachusetts
avenue
to
th
street
when
i
round
the
corner
to
the
post
s
building
i
witness
a
frighten
sight
the
street
be
ablaze
with
light
and
action
with
fire
engine
police
television
camera
and
hundred
of
picket
mass
around
the
building
a
policeman
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
street
block
traffic
from
enter
i
pull
up
explain
who
i
be
and
say
that
i
need
to
go
in
but
hesitate
to
drive
alone
into
the
parking
lot
next
door
to
the
building
leave
the
car
right
there
he
told
me
i
ll
watch
it
i
pull
over
get
out
and
begin
walk
down
the
middle
of
the
street
where
the
picketers
saw
me
come
for
a
moment
i
be
worried
that
they
would
try
to
prevent
me
from
enter
or
bad
hurt
me
but
i
suppose
i
assume
they
would
not
hurt
a
woman
which
later
turn
out
not
to
be
the
case
as
it
be
i
put
my
head
down
and
plow
through
the
picket
line
into
the
side
entrance
once
inside
i
experienced
a
sort
of
reverse
drama
a
quiet
empty
dark
building
with
no
one
in
sight
almost
all
of
the
executive
and
manager
have
go
home
at
about
a
m
when
everything
seem
quiet
and
when
larry
wallace
have
report
that
negotiation
would
continue
mark
have
call
them
to
come
back
in
but
they
be
upstairs
confer
i
go
downstairs
to
look
at
the
desert
pressroom
what
i
saw
shock
and
sadden
me
clearly
there
have
be
a
riot
of
sort
a
foot
of
water
cover
the
floor
the
smell
of
smoke
be
everywhere
ben
later
described
the
place
as
look
like
the
engine
room
in
a
burn
out
ship
s
hulk
i
don
t
remember
see
a
soul
in
the
entire
area
maybe
a
remain
fireman
or
two
it
be
eerie
stand
there
look
at
the
damage
i
go
up
to
the
seventh
floor
where
i
found
mark
and
the
assemble
executive
mark
explain
to
us
what
have
happen
when
the
previous
night
s
negotiate
session
have
end
at
about
dugan
have
hand
wallace
a
letter
say
that
his
men
be
terminate
the
contract
but
be
willing
to
continue
to
work
under
its
term
only
as
long
as
meaningful
negotiation
continue
because
a
federal
mediator
have
schedule
more
negotiation
and
because
larry
have
have
conversation
with
several
union
representative
to
the
effect
that
the
other
union
be
willing
to
forgo
schedule
negotiate
session
with
the
company
for
a
few
day
while
the
negotiation
with
the
pressman
continued
both
he
and
mark
have
assume
that
those
negotiation
would
carry
on
the
first
mark
knew
that
this
be
not
to
be
be
when
jim
hover
bleeding
profusely
from
a
head
wound
walk
into
his
office
our
gathering
in
mark
s
office
soon
after
a
m
that
first
day
be
the
begin
of
what
turn
into
several
month
of
high
drama
and
intense
challenge
i
never
want
a
strike
and
have
definitively
told
mark
and
our
manager
to
avoid
one
if
possible
and
once
it
begin
i
agree
with
mark
who
say
at
the
very
begin
we
don
t
want
this
strike
to
last
one
second
longer
than
be
necessary
however
none
of
the
preparation
we
have
make
for
publishing
in
case
of
a
brief
strike
which
be
the
most
we
fear
have
include
the
possibility
of
trouble
such
as
have
occur
we
be
stun
by
have
the
press
so
badly
damage
electrical
wiring
have
be
ripped
out
essential
operating
part
remove
oil
drain
out
to
strip
the
gear
and
newsprint
roll
slash
and
by
have
almost
all
the
craft
union
in
the
building
out
on
strike
together
the
first
thing
we
have
to
deal
with
be
the
reporter
who
start
to
come
in
to
work
unaware
of
what
have
take
place
we
set
up
tour
of
the
pressroom
for
anyone
who
have
come
into
the
building
through
the
picket
line
these
tour
be
ben
s
idea
once
he
saw
how
extensive
the
destruction
be
and
how
premeditate
it
have
be
for
example
fire
extinguisher
tamper
with
and
fire
then
set
he
be
convince
that
the
reporter
need
to
see
for
themselves
what
have
happen
to
get
the
fact
so
that
they
could
make
an
inform
choice
most
of
these
newspaper
guild
member
be
as
shock
as
the
rest
of
us
that
afternoon
they
held
a
boisterous
meeting
at
which
many
of
them
criticize
the
damage
and
violence
brian
flores
and
the
rest
of
the
paid
hierarchy
of
the
guild
strongly
urge
them
to
support
the
pressman
and
deny
that
much
damage
have
occur
the
guild
however
in
a
voice
vote
vote
overwhelmingly
against
a
motion
to
honor
the
picket
line
except
for
the
very
small
union
represent
those
who
work
in
building
service
the
guild
be
the
only
one
of
the
post
s
union
to
cross
the
picket
line
some
guild
member
decide
to
honor
it
but
most
stayed
in
the
great
majority
of
them
be
troubled
and
torn
but
they
be
at
work
for
which
we
be
grateful
although
we
knew
that
their
presence
be
tenuous
and
might
grow
more
so
as
time
pass
the
battle
of
public
relation
start
immediately
luckily
we
have
hire
ted
van
dyk
to
take
care
of
our
pr
in
case
of
trouble
so
we
be
able
quickly
to
release
a
statement
explain
what
have
happen
and
then
to
keep
up
a
steady
beat
of
bulletin
throughout
the
strike
explain
the
position
of
the
post
s
management
and
the
rationale
for
our
action
the
pressman
s
union
put
forth
its
own
public
relation
effort
accuse
the
post
of
be
responsible
for
the
frustration
of
its
member
their
party
line
be
that
the
post
be
outrageously
try
to
eliminate
important
clause
negotiate
in
previous
contract
the
first
few
day
of
the
strike
be
particularly
wild
punctuate
by
court
procedure
and
attempt
on
our
part
to
get
organize
october
be
take
up
with
ad
hoc
planning
all
but
about
fifty
thousand
copy
of
wednesday
s
issue
of
the
post
have
be
print
and
those
be
distribute
while
we
be
assess
the
extent
of
the
damage
and
whether
the
bad
hit
press
be
permanently
ruin
we
announce
that
there
would
be
no
paper
the
next
day
and
have
no
guess
as
to
when
we
would
be
able
to
resume
publication
but
mark
add
that
the
editorial
staff
be
go
about
its
normal
work
and
that
we
intend
to
publish
soon
somehow
somewhere
one
of
our
first
concern
be
the
personal
safety
of
those
who
be
work
and
would
be
daily
cross
the
picket
line
this
worry
lead
us
to
seek
a
temporary
restrain
order
that
would
restrict
the
picket
from
violent
act
in
part
by
limit
the
number
of
picket
who
could
be
outside
the
building
in
any
give
period
we
manage
to
get
a
court
order
about
twenty
four
hour
after
the
initial
violence
but
despite
this
a
smoke
bomb
be
thrown
through
a
window
in
our
photo
studio
and
there
be
indiscriminate
swing
at
people
go
in
and
out
of
the
building
kathy

one
of
someone
carry
a
gun
at
the
same
time
that
we
be
address
safety
concern
we
move
quickly
to
make
sure
we
could
publish
as
soon
as
possible
someone
have
previously
be
in

with
several

the
morning
of

i
go
to
see
joe

to
propose
the
idea
that

course
have

place
i
realize
that
he
probably

t
agree
but
i
felt

south
of

just
one
block
away
from
our

which
would

close

night
and
hand
it
to

take
off
i
wasn
t
the
only
one
frighten

the
early
day
when
we
need

us
repair
the

at
least
one
man
say
that
cross
the
picket
line
be
less
frighten
for
him
than
be
helicoptered
into
the
building
via
the
roof
we
have
miss
one
day
of
publishing
the
post
and
didn
t
intend
to
miss
any
more
we
have
identify
six
plant
that
agree
to
print
the
post
don
pale
with
fury
appear
in
my
office
later
on
that
second
day
the
very
day
that
i
have
go
to
see
allbritton
to
say
that
not
only
be
the
star
not
go
to
help
us
but
it
be
go
to
publish
the
name
of
one
of
the
plant
that
would
be
printing
our
paper
almost
an
invitation
to
the
picketers
to
start
beating
up
people
there
as
well
i
call
joe
immediately
and
suggest
that
if
this
be
so
it
might
get
someone
kill
joe
reply
that
he
be
unaware
this
be
happen
and
ask
who
could
possibly
be
do
it
i
explode
i
don
t
know
joe
but
if
you
can
t
find
out
who
in
your
goddamn
paper
be
do
it
i
can
t
help
you
this
be
an
unneeded
outburst
of
temper
but
we
be
all
very
tense
the
star
didn
t
print
the
name
of
the
paper
at
that
time
some
of
the
plant
that
help
us
actually
reveal
the
fact
themselves
work
out
helicopter
land
site
at
each
of
the
small
plant
be
highly
complicate
sometimes
there
be
only
a
football
field
lit
with
the
headlight
of
car
at
the
other
end
of
the
process
the
circulation
department
have
to
work
out
inconceivably
complicate
route
to
pick
up
the
paper
at
each
of
the
plant
for
delivery
back
to
washington
and
its
surround
suburb
because
different
paper
production
center
would
get
tire
they
be
printing
their
own
paper
as
well
as
part
of
ours
some
would
give
up
or
take
a
break
which
meant
that
each
day
our
planner
have
to
start
virtually
from
scratch
replanning
land
site
and
delivery
schedule
despite
all
the
logistic
difficulty
on
october
with
only
one
day
of
not
publishing
the
post
print
and
distribute
to
our
reader
late
but
nevertheless
there
a
limited
twenty
four
page
edition
of
five
hundred
thousand
that
have
be
print
in
the
six
small
plant
ring
the
washington
area
it
be
a
halt
begin
but
a
real
and
significant
triumph
know
that
we
couldn
t
ask
these
plant
to
print
their
own
paper
and
ours
indefinitely
we
set
to
work
to
try
to
get
our
press
up
and
run
again
to
complicate
matter
far
the
go
company
which
make
the
press
we
own
be
on
strike
so
part
be
hard
to
obtain
i
personally
call
the
international
president
of
the
machinist
union
who
be
in
san
francisco
where
the
afl
cio
be
have
a
national
meeting
and
ask
him
to
let
union
machinist
fix
our
press
i
plead
with
him
that
we
have
to
fix
the
press
and
told
him
that
we
hop
to
stay
with
union
labor
but
that
if
the
union
machinist
couldn
t
come
into
the
building
we
would
have
to
bring
in
others
he
remain
adamant
so
other
newspaper
mostly
nonunion
but
a
few
union
lent
us
machinist
particularly
electrician
and
engineer
to
begin
to
repair
the
damage
we
hire
guard
to
establish
well
security
around
the
plant
which
have
the
desire
effect
of
encourage
more
people
to
come
in
to
work
though
more
guild
member
come
in
the
guild
issue
a
bulletin
call
on
both
side
to
resume
negotiation
criticize
larry
wallace
s
tactic
and
appoint
a
three
member
committee
to
monitor
negotiation
and
report
back
to
the
membership
in
one
week
the
guild
forbade
its
member
to
perform
any
work
other
than
their
own
essentially
prevent
member
from
help
us
in
any
way
a
few
brave
people
do
so
anyway
throughout
the
long
month
of
the
strike
but
especially
in
those
first
few
wild
day
there
be
fervent
discussion
heat
argument
vituperative
bulletin
and
repeat
meeting
among
guild
member
with
the
guild
officer
threaten
and
cajole
while
the
member
continued
to
vote
to
stay
in
although
the
margin
of
vote
grow
increasingly
narrow
two
day
after
that
overwhelm
voice
vote
on
the
first
day
of
the
strike
when
the
guild
vote
again
to
stay
in
the
vote
be
to
on
october
i
go
to
a
meeting
of
publisher
at
the
headquarters
of
the
american
newspaper
publisher
association
in
reston
virginia
i
knew
they
have
invite
joe
allbritton
and
me
separately
to
talk
to
the
member
i
give
the
publisher
a
full
account
of
what
have
happen
to
date
and
where
we
stood
in
negotiation
and
in
continue
to
publish
i
take
with
me
photograph
of
the
pressroom
evidence
of
what
have
take
place
basically
my
fellow
publisher
ask
me
if
this
be
the
time
to
get
together
in
a
joint
operating
agreement
with
the
star
answer
no
they
also
ask
if
i
intend
to
go
all
the
way
by
which
they
meant
do
i
intend
to
bust
the
union
and
never
let
its
member
back
my
response
to
this
be
that
i
didn
t
know
how
thing
would
develop
but
that
we
expect
to
publish
while
try
to
negotiate
with
the
union
we
would
do
the
best
we
could
under
the
circumstance
i
consistently
refuse
to
promise
to
get
rid
of
the
union
because
i
wasn
t
go
to
risk
the
paper
over
something
we
might
not
be
able
to
achieve
some
of
the
publisher
say
that
if
i
didn
t
promise
to
go
that
far
they
wouldn
t
help
i
say
i
be
sorry
if
that
be
the
case
because
we
obviously
badly
need
all
kind
of
help
but
i
couldn
t
promise
to
do
something
that
might
not
be
possible
to
do
at
that
point
i
be
less
focus
on
ultimate
goal
not
even
be
sure
what
our
goal
should
be
and
more
resolve
on
get
the
press
fix
and
publishing
the
post
temporarily
without
the
craft
union
but
from
our
own
plant
after
i
have
finish
my
presentation
and
be
on
my
way
out
a
good
friend
of
mine
frank
daniel
publisher
of
the
raleigh
news
and
observer
jumped
in
the
car
to
keep
me
company
on
the
ride
back
to
washington
frank
spoke
with
a
strong
southern
accent
and
i
ll
never
forget
his
word
or
his
inflection
and
meaning
watch
out
sugah
they
want
you
to
bust
the
union
despite
the
warn
from
frank
and
the
one
issue
at
the
meeting
much
of
the
industry
be
extremely
helpful
and
several
paper
support
us
valiantly
throughout
by
sunday
october
we
be
still
publishing
a
clearly
curtail
and
money
lose
newspaper
print
by
the
remote
plant
which
of
course
we
be
pay
on
october
i
met
with
those
people
who
be
still
work
so
that
i
could
tell
them
what
we
intend
to
do
the
first
thing
i
do
be
to
address
the
union
charge
of
bad
faith
negotiate
and
union
bust
by
state
firmly
my
own
belief
in
the
value
of
union
i
do
not
expect
that
all
our
outlook
will
be
exactly
alike
in
the
normal
and
healthy
tension
that
exists
between
union
and
management
they
could
not
and
should
not
be
that
tension
peacefully
and
lawfully
express
and
peacefully
and
lawfully
resolve
in
contract
negotiation
be
one
of
the
great
goad
to
the
constant
improvement
of
our
paper
it
keep
us
move
toward
a
well
sounder
more
stable
and
securer
enterprise
that
tension
in
short
be
good
for
all
of
us
it
be
good
for
the
washington
post
because
i
believe
this
so
firmly
and
because
this
conception
of
the
value
and
importance
of
unionism
have
be
so
firmly
a
part
of
the
tradition
of
my
family
and
of
those
who
have
work
to
make
this
newspaper
great
over
the
year
i
hope
you
will
bear
with
me
while
i
address
the
general
charge
that
have
be
make
we
have
be
accuse
of
an
attempt
at
union
bust
and
of
bad
faith
negotiation
with
a
view
to
union
bust
i
realize
that
these
accusation
be
often
merely
part
of
the
rhetoric
thrown
about
in
a
period
of
labor
management
strain
but
they
happen
to
be
charge
that
i
take
very
seriously
and
yes
very
personally
they
be
false
i
believe
in
the
right
to
organize
to
bargain
and
to
strike
i
believe
also
in
the
right
to
publish
but
i
do
not
believe
in
the
right
to
vandalize
frighten
destroy
and
assault
i
do
not
believe
in
the
right
of
any
union
to
create
condition
under
which
member
of
other
union
would
have
be
unable
to
work
even
if
a
negotiate
settlement
have
be
reach
some
of
us
in
this
room
let
us
not
pretend
otherwise
have
have
our
severe
difference
in
the
past
over
what
be
desirable
and
what
be
just
in
a
contract
settlement
and
we
shall
no
doubt
have
them
in
the
future
but
we
do
not
disagree
on
this
we
say
no
to
violence
no
to
brute
intimidation
no
to
the
calculate
destruction
of
other
people
s
and
other
union
opportunity
to
work
or
even
to
choose
whether
to
work
i
especially
address
guild
member
say
how
much
i
appreciate
and
didn
t
take
for
grant
their
presence
in
the
building
i
honestly
felt
that
those
who
be
there
have
make
a
hard
choice
and
a
brave
decision
i
also
told
them
that
i
knew
they
too
would
strike
if
they
felt
the
management
be
be
unfair
vi
vi
the
pressman
i
assure
them
that
the
channel
of
communication
in
our
building
though
imperfect
be
nevertheless
open
add
when
you
think
we
be
do
something
wrong
we
will
listen
within
our
wall
as
at
the
negotiate
table
we
be
try
to
do
what
be
morally
right
and
what
be
humanly
right
before
we
be
try
to
do
anything
else
mark
then
spoke
and
he
also
say
that
we
be
willing
to
resume
negotiation
with
the
pressman
the
violence
of
course
complicate
the
negotiation
immeasurably
we
sue
the
union
for
damage
and
a
grand
jury
begin
investigate
the
violence
by
that
even
one
press
be
fix
we
have
a
crew
ready
to
run
it
a
group
of
advertising

others

a
historic
breakthrough

itself
this
special

by
joe

a
much
beloved

crucial
moment

arrive
but
could
our
amateur

really
run
a
press
the
press
look
so
huge
and
complex
and
forbid
that
it

into
action

a
hundred
thousand
paper
that
very
night
the
next

their

through
the

where
they

there
to

load
the
first

which
be
to
be
driven
by
an
extremely
brave
distributor
with
another
one
rid
shotgun
in
a
nearly
literal
sense

and
i
be
both
on

and
watch
there
be
a
police
car

be
an
electric
moment

with
symbolism

those
of

the

be
steadily
put
out
bulletin

that
first
week
say
that
many
of
its

be
not
go
to
work
because
they
couldn
t
cross
the
pressman
s
picket
line
and
because
they
bitterly
resent
management
s
effort
to
intimidate
guild
member
who
be
still
work
inside
the
building
and
those
who
have
chosen
to
stay
out
the
guild
remind
its
member
that
the
situation
be
fluid
and
could
change
at
any
time
on
october
the
guild
vote
a
third
time
to
stay
in

this
time
by
an
even
small
margin
to
oddly
the
pressman
actually
manage
to
help
us
in
our
effort
to
keep
the
guild
work
whenever
we
be
extremely
nervous
they
would
pull
some
stunt
that
outrage

them
in
one

well
as
on
several

go
on
duty
when
the

and
at
first
didn

finish
until
or
a
m
it

a
tough
job
that
left
us
filthy
sweaty
and
cover
with
paste
we
have
to
roll
up
each
individual
paper
in
a
brown
wrapper

big
smelly
heavy
and
unwieldy
canvas
bag
at

side

we
then
drag
over
to
another

they

finally
haul
off
to
the
post
office
this
be
the
only
time
in
my
life
that
i
regret
the
substantial
circulation
the
post
have
outside
of
washington
the
whole
job
be
so
tedious
and
interminable
that
we
come
to
look
on
it
as
our
supreme
service
for
the
cause
the
ultimate
sacrifice
warren
buffett
who
spent
several
saturday
night
in
the
mailroom
with
us
say
it
make
him
rethink
the
price
of
the
sunday
paper
no
price
be
sufficient
for
the
first
ten
day
of
the
strike
we
operate
at
an
extraordinarily
high
level
of
activity
and
in
a
state
of
particularly
high
pressure
there
be
constant
meeting
of
top
management
the
tension
for
all
of
us
be
indescribable
and
the
strain
on
me
be
the
bad
i
have
ever
experienced
the
uncertainty
the
difficulty
the
violence
against
the
people
who
be
work
the
fear
that
the
star
would
use
the
opportunity
to
turn
the
table
be
all
overwhelm
i
felt
desperate
and
secretly
wonder
if
i
might
have
blown
the
whole
thing
and
lose
the
paper
i
didn
t
really
see
how
we
be
go
to
manage
the
only
way
i
can
describe
the
extent
of
my
anxiety
be
to
say
that
i
felt
as
if
i
be
pregnant
with
a
rock
yet
despite
my
inner
turmoil
i
have
to
appear
calm
and
determine
and
to
come
across
as
optimistic
in
order
to
convey
that
attitude
to
others
one
of
the
toughest
pressure
that
be
brought
to
bear
on
me
come
in
a
meeting
with
ed
williams
and
ben
together
with
mark
and
don
i
know
that
ed
and
ben
thought
they
have
the
best
interest
of
the
paper
at
heart
but
ed
at
least
clearly
thought
we
be
commit
suicide
by
not
give
in
to
the
pressman
s
demand
ed
be
a
lawyer
with
superb
judgment
about
almost
everything
but
i
felt
he
didn
t
understand
the
issue
in
this
case
or
all
that
lay
behind
the
strike
and
how
important
it
be
that
we
not
give
in
on
top
of
everything
else
he
told
us
in
no
uncertain
term
that
we
seem
to
be
operating
under
some
delusion
that
we
be
actually
put
out
a
paper
he
say
i
read
it
in
the
car
come
to
work
it
take
me
five
minute
and
then
i
throw
it
on
the
floor
joe
allbritton
be
eat
your
lunch
you
have
to
give
in
and
take
the
union
back
i
m
not
sure
what
ben
s
view
be
at
that
moment
except
that
i
know
he
always
care
above
all
for
editorial
quality
so
it
must
have
pain
him
to
hear
ed
say
this
about
the
paper
he
have
work
so
hard
to
build
i
also
know
that
he
be
worried
about
the
people
who
work
for
him
the
reporter
and
editor
who
remain
deeply
distressed
and
perhaps
he
have
be
persuade
by
ed
that
we
be
wrong
but
mark
don
and
i
have
no
doubt
we
just
shook
our
head
and
say
we
have
no
choice
but
to
go
forward
and
carry
on
as
best
we
could
the
meeting
with
ed
and
ben
bother
me
because
i
love
and
value
them
and
continued
to
do
so
but
it
didn
t
shake
my
conviction
or
don
s
or
mark
s
for
a
minute
one
day
during
those
particularly
agonize
first
few
week
i
be
sit
in
my
office
brooding
when
meg
come
in
and
quickly
realize
how
sunk
i
be
i
knew
i
could
discus
my
real
feeling
with
her
because
i
trust
her
discretion
and
i
told
her
i
literally
thought
i
couldn
t
stand
the
tension
i
be
paralyze
with
fear
and
thought
i
might
break
she
say
something
that
sound
strange
but
in
fact
give
me
comfort
relief
don
t
forget
there
be
an
alternative
meg
say
you
can
give
up
you
be
in
control
of
that
decision
and
keep
that
in
mind
can
help
you
stay
in
as
long
as
you
want
neither
one
of
us
thought
this
a
serious
alternative
but
the
very
idea
relieve
my
desperate
sense
of
be
trap
somehow
acknowledge
that
i
have
an
alternative
however
horrible
lessen
my
dread
another
tremendously
helpful
friend
be
warren
who
arrive
within
the
first
week
and
come
to
stay
with
me
periodically
throughout
the
strike
he
later
confess
that
he
come
almost
at
once
because
mark
meagher
and
don
have
realize
what
personal
tension
i
be
under
and
have
suggest
he
come
warren
be
at
my
house
on
the
second
sunday
morning
of
the
strike
when
the
post
be
deliver
we
be
like
two
child
stand
at
the
door
amaze
to
think
that
we
have
print
nearly
copy
of
the
paper
in
our
own
plant
only
about
fifty
thousand
short
of
the
normal
press
run
as
an
eighty
eight
page
paper
it
look
fairly
respectable
too
although
less
than
one
fourth
of
its
normal
size
our
satisfaction
and
pride
be
short
live
however
because
the
star
arrive
a
few
minute
later
while
we
be
still
smile
so
thick
with
advertising
that
we
could
hardly
lift
it
it
be
page
more
than
twice
the
size
of
its
sunday
paper
on
the
week
before
the
strike
it
be
a
whopper
warren
recall
there
be
no
question
about
it
in
addition
to
be
constantly
supportive
warren
offer
substantive
advice
look
he
say
i
ll
watch
it
for
you
if
i
ever
think
you
be
in
danger
of
lose
and
have
to
give
up
i
ll
tell
you
that
be
a
great
comfort
i
knew
that
his
judgment
on
this
as
on
so
much
else
would
be
right
he
be
watch
for
what
he
call
the
tip
point
as
he
later
explain
it
when
you
re
down
for
one
day
it
doesn
t
change
anything
if
you
re
down
for
a
year
you
ve
lose
your
whole
enterprise
where
in
between
do
the
line
cross
what
he
be
watch
for
be
that
line
cross
point
look
back
he
admit
you
didn
t
come
near
that
point
where
you
be
in
serious
danger
of
lose
the
company
but
it
s
like
look
for
a
cure
for
cancer
you
either
find
the
cure
or
you
die
in
six
month
and
if
you
find
one
in
the
fourth
month
you
say
there
be
nothing
to
it
warren
told
me
later
that
he
knew
it
be
for
me
life
or
death
yet
at
the
same
time
you
can
t
look
to
the
troop
or
do
anything
as
though
you
aren
t
in
control
of
yourself
but
if
you
really
understand
the
situation
you
know
you
shouldn
t
be
in
control
of
yourself
so
you
face
that
terrible
dilemma
that
express
well
than
i
can
why
even
though
the
pressure
on
me
ease
as
we
grow
in
capability
and
page
the
basic
tension
never
recede
another
pillar
on
whom
i
knew
i
could
rely
be
jack
patterson
he
have
be
ill
with
a
blood
clot
in
his
leg
and
be
not
suppose
to
be
on
his
foot
too
long
much
less
lift
heavy
bundle
but
he
be
in
charge
of
the
very
complex
problem
of
deliver
the
paper
from
all
the
small
plant
and
later
from
the
mailroom
to
the
wait

of
all

don
also
help
me
not
to
mention
the
paper

bore
the
overall
responsibility
for
the
company
s
planning
in
the
strike
and
do
so
superbly
but
need
to
look
at
the
large
picture
and
have
his
hand
more
than
full
planning
our
strategy
our
negotiation
and
our
outside
public
relation
he
have
hand
to
don
the
very
difficult
job
of
run
the
paper
day
to
day
it
be
a
heavy
obligation
for
don
at
the
age
of
thirty
to
have
thrust
on
him
but
he
rise
to
the
occasion
magnificently
and
get
his
hand
on
the
actual
machinery

him
a
lot
finally
the
people
inside
the
building
work
to
get
out
the
paper
be
heroic
however
they
add
to
my
pressure
by
say
we
don
t
mind
do
this
but
don
t
let
us
down
meaning
don
t
let
the
pressman
back
don
t
give
in
as
the
post
have
do
too
many
time
in
the
past
by
october
nearly
two
week
into
the
strike
we
be
able
to
print
our
entire
pressrun
from
our
own
plant
we
now
have
four
press
fix
but
be
still
printing
only
a
forty
page
daily
paper
probably
because
we
be
begin
to
get
back
on
our
foot
sooner
than
i
have
thought
possible
and
to
an
extent
that
i
would
not
have
believe
when
i
first
saw
the
damage
to
the
press
i
begin
to
be
more
hopeful
clearly
there
be
progress
on
some
front
however
gradual
our
press
crew
be
do
an
amaze
job
there
be
small
milestone
for
the
october
paper
we
have
replated
the

for
a
later
edition

and
an
automobile

president
ford
have
be
in
by
october
we
have
go
to
forty
eight
page
the
most
we
could
publish
without
use
a
kind
of
printing
call
a
collect
run
which
require
more
people
and
longer
pressruns
we
make
a
big
leap
forward
when
we
start
run
collect
the
advertising
executive
be
on
the
press
and
knew
we
be
have
to
turn
down
advertising
because
we
couldn
t
go
up
in
page
at
first
don
be
reluctant
to
let
them
do
it
because
it
be
trickier
to
pull
off
and
even
dangerous
for
amateur
press
people
but
they
prevail
by
sunday
october
our
final
edition
have
nine
section
and
page
we
have
eight
men

these
eight

how
we

i
spent
most
of
my

at

one
of
the
huge
newsprint
roll
run
out
this
as
we
say
at
the
time
be
very
likely
the
first
time
in
modern
newspaper
history
that
woman
have
be
in
this
job
if
you
didn
t
prepare
the
new
roll
just
right
the
paper
tore
and
stop
the
press
automatically
the
process
require
a
great
deal
of
dexterity
and
i
be
leery
of
the
responsibility
for
break
the
web
which
be
extremely
onerous
to
reweave
to
my
shame
i
be
unskilled
enough
to
be
reduce
at
time
to
pick
up
accumulate
trash
but
on
the
whole
we
be
grow
really
proficient
at
all
our
additional
job
and
the
process
of
put
out
the
paper
be
get
more
predictable
over
the
month
we
settle
into
a
certain
routine
more
or
less
hole
up
in
the
building
with
many
people
camped
out
essentially
living
in

be
high
especially
in
the
first
week
long
before
we
ever
thought
the
strike
might
stretch
on
as
it
do
and
we
do
whatever
we
could
to
keep
it
that
way
we

a
note

the

confusion
of
the

we
have
several
other
worry
as
the
strike
drag
on
into
november
the
city
room
begin
to
get
even
more
edgy
many
reporter
be
suffer
deeply
from
pang
about
cross
the
picket
line
i
receive
two
communication
then
from
guild
member
who
be
still
work
one
address
to
both
larry
wallace
and
me
be
sign
by
forty
one
people
they
be
write
to
ensure
that
their
presence
in
the
building
wasn
t
take
as
blanket
approval
of
the
post
management
s
conduct
of
its
labor
relation
and
demand
reassurance
that
we
be
continue
to
bargain
in
good
faith
i
assure
them
that
we
be
and
that
we
want
all
the
union
back
with
the
exception
of
those
pressman
who
have
engage
in
the
violence
a
few
day
later
another
letter
arrive
from
about
eighty
member
of
the
post
unit
of
the
guild
this
letter
include
twenty
specific
question
to
which
they
want
answer
they
acknowledge
the
damage
do
to
the
pressroom
but
point
out
that
this
issue
be
now
in
the
legal
justice
system
the
signer
felt
that
more
than
a
month
have
pass
since
the
begin
of
the
strike
there
should
have
be
far
sign
that
the
company
be
act
to
settle
the
dispute
they
add
we
have
subject
ourselves
to
punitive
action
by
our
own
union
and
possibly
split
our
rank
beyond
repair
while
you
may
choose
to
think
kindly
of
us
when
guild
negotiation
come
up
next
year
we
would
prefer
not
to
have
to
rely
on
your
benevolence
but
to
go
into
contract
negotiation
as
a
strong
union
your
response
to
the
follow
question
will
help
us
make
up
our
mind
it
be
our
feel
that
through
your
response
you
may
make
a
demonstration
of
good
faith
that
would
help
rebuild
the
crumble
management
labor
relationship
at
the
post
obviously
my
reply
be
go
to
be
extremely
important
the
answer
to
the
twenty
question
be
draft
and
work
over
at
great
length
by
don
meg
and
me
from
my
point
of
view
some
of
the
question
be
irrelevant
and
silly
such
as
the
reason
for
the
amount
of
severance
paid
to
paul
ignatius
when
he
left
in
even
so
this
be
a
good
chance
for
us
to
communicate
our
view
one
important
statement
be
this
there
be
one
crucial
aspect
of
all
this
however
that
your
letter
lead
me
to
believe
you
have
fail
to
take
into
account
it
be
that
the
violence
both
in
the
pressroom
last
month
and
in
various
episode
since
have
profoundly
alter
and
complicate
our
good
faith
search
for
a
settlement
before
october
we
have
the
luxury
of
be
able
to
seek
a
gradual
phase
solution
to
the
problem
in
the
pressroom
when
i
say
we
do
not
have
the
luxury
now
i
mean
that
it
would
in
my
judgment
be
the
ultimate
act
of
irresponsibility
on
our
part
to
permit
the
pressman
to
return
under
the
old
condition
i
could
not
myself
in
good
faith
preside
over
a
building
or
an
enterprise
in
which
people
who
have
work
faithfully
and
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
for
the
company
be
in
continue
physical
danger
from
fellow
employee
in
which
those
who
control
a
whole
section
of
our
building
while
those
who
have
work
to
repair
the
damage
to
the
company
and
to
get
the
paper
out
have
to
be
transfer
elsewhere
to
get
them
out
of
harm
s
way
in
which
hire
and
man
practice
permit
not
just
the
same
kind
of
featherbed
but
also
the
same
importation
of
men
likely
to
commit
the
same
kind
of
violence
should
they
be
cross
the
pressman
in
the
early
morning
hour
of
october
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
set
it
as
some
future
desirable
goal
that
we
should
be
allow
to
have
management
supervisor
present
in
the
pressroom
we
need
a
contract
that
be
fair
to
our
pressman
we
also
need
a
contract
that
be
fair
to
us
i
would
deceive
you
if
i
say
this
result
would
be
easy
to
achieve
or
that
it
be
a
sure
thing
that
it
can
be
achieve
at
all
but
we
be
try
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
go
on
to
answer
each
of
the
long
technical
question
how
the
pressman
would
be
paid
what
the
post
s
new
position
on
collective
bargaining
be
why
i
have
set
a
profit
goal
of
percent
why
we
have
train
management
employee
to
operate
the
press
in
the
first
place
why
we
let
guild
people
help
us
whether
we
be
lean
on
other
publisher
to
get
the
pressman
blacklist
what
our
position
be
toward
indict
or
convict
pressman
we
finally
get
our
response
complete
and
sent
our
answer
out
as
well
as
post
them
around
the
building
on
bulletin
board
where
cluster
of
people
immediately
gather
to
read
them
one
reader
be
overheard
to
murmur
there
be
one
question
miss
when
ask
what
it
be
he
reply
mr
graham
how
be
your
sex
life
guild
member
who
be
not
work
met
together
outside
the
building
and
call
themselves
the
rank
and
file
strike
support
committee
they
issue
at
least
fourteen
pamphlet
during
the
week
of
the
strike
try
to
get
the
post
s
other
guild
member
to
come
out
with
them
it
seem
particularly
ironic
that
we
be
question
about
whether
we
be
negotiate
in
good
faith
but
that
they
never
ask
the
pressman
the
same
question
the
star
understandably
take
every
advantage
there
be
to
take
at
one
point
we
learn
that
some
of
the
pressman
who
ordinarily
work
at
the
post
possibly
as
many
as
forty
be
work
at
the
star
it
didn
t
make
us
feel
well
when
we
heard
that
the
pressman
s
union
say
that
most
of
the
money
these
men
earn
there
be
be
contribute
to
a
central
strike
fund
yet
despite
all
that
our
competition
be
do
we
overtook
the
star
at
least
in
term
of
page
publish
on
october
only
three
week
after
the
strike
begin
and
during
the
last
week
in
october
the
post
become
profitable
again
for
the
first
time
since
october
a
remarkable
accomplishment
but
also
by
the
end
of
the
month
the
star
have
gain
million
in
revenue
over
the
year
before
and
be
up
in
advertising
by
two
million
line
much
have
pour
into
the
star
because
the
post
couldn
t
print
it
the
star
ran
in
the
black
that
october
for
the
first
time
in
sixty
month
its
operating
loss
accord
to
an
article
in
the
post
at
the
time
have
be
run
at
a
rate
of
nearly
million
a
month
so
its
advertising
increase
be
certainly
help
to
offset
the
loss
we
knew
that
the
star
despite
its
current
surplus
of
revenue
over
expense
have
a
more
than
million
debt
but
we
also
knew
that
joe
allbritton
have
deep
pocket
i
felt
we
be
be
lambast
in
the
press
for
be
goliath
to
the
brave
little
david
partly
through
what
i
thought
be
story
plant
by
our
competition
i
certainly
believe
that
the
star
be
do
everything
it
could
to
hurt
us
nevertheless
because
we
have
to
live
together
in
the
same
town
and
in
fact
have
help
each
other
in
many
way
over
the
last
forty
plus
year
of
my
family
s
ownership
i
also
believe
in
maintain
civil
relation
consequently
on
december
i
rush
back
from
new
york
where
i
d
be
for
an
anpa
meeting
to
attend
a

something
nice
to

on

to
depict
me
brutally
with
my
breast
caught
and
drawn
out
at
length
in
a
wringer
this
one
from
a
press
i
found
it
terribly
wound
say
nothing
and
left
one
group
or
another
start
lean
on
us
to
be
reasonable
in
mid
november
mark

and
i
go
up
to

with
the
local
member
of
the

offer
their
service
to
find
out
what
the
strike
be
about
and
to
step
in
when
they
found
out
that
the
pressman
s
union
be
all
male
and
all
white
the
one
black
pressman
have
be
hurt
and
left
the
paper
before
the
strike
their
enthusiasm
for
support
the
union
subside
somewhat
i
ran
into

the
windy
prolabor
expert
at
the
home
of
a
prominent
civic
leader
in
washington
at
one
of
the
few
dinner
i
attend
during
the
strike
he
assure
me
that
in
a
strike
everyone
have
to
give
and
that
it
have
to
be
settle
he
have
arbitrate
an
airline
strike
and
would
be
glad
to
step
into
ours
i
respond
rather
sharply
that
we
be
do
fine
and
i
saw
no
need
for
his
intervention
then
or
ever
other
worry
abound
though
the
paper
be
grow
and
we
be
printing
from
our
own
plant

the

have
occur
just
four
year
after
we
have
go
public
and
we
be
still
a
relatively
small
company
pending
the
outcome
of
the

industry
analyst
be
withholding
their
assessment
of
our
financial
performance
as
a

best
or
at
bad

their
estimate
of

per

earnings
for
the
year
which
clearly
affected
stock
purchase
larry
israel
mark
meagher
and
i
told
a
new
york
financial
analyst
meeting
that
the
strike
would
cause
the
first
earnings
drop
we
have
experienced
since
we
d
go
public
time
be
an
odd
factor
throughout
the
strike
if
someone
have
told
me
at
the
begin
that
four
and
a
half
month
later
we
would
still
be
work
at
our
regular
job
while
help
out
in
department
everywhere
in
the
building
to
produce
a
daily
paper
i
wouldn
t
have
believe
it
i
would
not
have
thought
we
could
endure
sometimes
it
s
well
not
to
know
i
remember
the
first
time
i
heard
someone
mention
thanksgiving
my
immediate
thought
be
that
s
impossible
we
can
t
still
be
here
by
thanksgiving
do
what
we
re
do
under
this
strain
and
uncertainty
but
thanksgiving
come
and
go
and
the
first
time
someone
mention
christmas
i
thought
the
same
thing
as
we
begin
to
experience
more
and
more
success
and
to
settle
into
the
routine
reality
of
put
out
the
ever
grow
paper
the
early
euphoria
diminish
a
process
help
along
by
fatigue
and
even
boredom
both
of
which
contribute
to
an
erosion
of
spirit
and
morale
one
editor
on
the
press
say
he
begin
to
understand
what
blue
collar
worker
felt
like
constantly
perform
a
tedious
and
thankless
yet
difficult
job
while
the
white
collar
executive
upstairs
make
decision
that
affected
their
life
and
their
work
although
the
pressure
do
decrease
a
bit
as
we
become
more
successful
there
be
still
no
way
to
tell
when
it
would
all
end
and
how
it
would
turn
out
so
the
anxiety
and
the
grind
quality
of
life
remain
i
worried
incessantly
that
the
total
exhaustion
of
our
small
work
force
particularly
because
it
be
get
harder
to
obtain
the
extra
help
we
be
use
in
small
but
essential
quantity
would
force
us
to
give
up
in
the
end
certain
industry
friend
especially
frank
batten
chairman
of
the
private
landmark
communication
company
and
stan
cook
of
the
chicago
tribune
come
in
periodically
to
talk
the
situation
over
with
me
i
remember
stan
encourage
me
to
stay
the
course
you
just
have
to
keep
up
the
steady
pressure
like
lean
on
a
gate
to
gradually
shut
it
and
despite
everything
there
actually
be
some
lighter
moment
phil
geyelin
sent
me
a
note
in
early
december
say
that
he
be
so
pleased
that
natalie
panetti
the

of

service
for
the

who
have
become
the
de

just
inform
him
that
in
addition
to
his
regular
duty
on
b
press
he
have
be
designate
an
assistant
supervisor
of
stuffer
his
note
say
this
be
just
to
tell
you
how
honor
i
be
by
this
assignment
and
the
expression
it
conveys
of
your
confidence
and
trust
in
me
upward
mobility
be
the
hallmark
of
a
great
newspaper
i
will
do
my
darndest
to
be
worthy
of
this
late
opportunity
you
have
provide
me
to
serve
you
in
new
and
interest
way
as
time
wore
on
for
those
of
us
do
the
dirty
and
seemingly
interminable
task
in
the
mailroom
in
order
to
divert
ourselves
from
the
tedium
we
start
write
note
to
people
on
the
front
page
i
believe
it
be
illegal
to
write
note
on
second
class
mail
but
that
didn
t
occur
to
us
or
if
it
do
we
didn
t
care
as
we
scribble
away
to
whatever
name
turn
up
who
might
be
a
friend
or
even
an
acquaintance
who
know
what
these
people
thought
when
they
get
their
sunday
post
along
with
a
message
help
i
m
a
prisoner
in
the
washington
post
mailroom
through
all
this
time
of
course
negotiation
with
the
pressman
s
union
be
continue
from
the
begin
as
mark
say
we
be
willing
to
maintain
their
high
income
even
counting
the
overtime
they
have
earn
in
the
past
due
to
absurd
work
rule
but
what
we
want
be
to
bring
under
control
those
featherbed
practice
that
be
severely
affect
our
capacity
to
produce
a
quality
paper
in
short
as
larry
wallace
summarize
we
be
try
through
collective
bargaining
to
regain
some
measure
of
control
over
the
operation
of
the
pressroom
in
order
that
there
will
be
a
more
efficient
more
productive
less
costly
and
less
wasteful
operation
our
earlier
offer
be
on
the
table
and
at
one
point
in
mid
november
a
meeting
be
set
at
which
the
pressman
be
schedule
to
make
a
counterproposal
when
the
session
convene
they
say
they
have
change
their
mind
and
would
not
produce
one
we
be
astonish
since
by
this
time
we
be
publishing
marginally
profitable
newspaper
and
be
surprised
that
the
pressman
still
seem
to
think
that
no
movement
on
their
part
be
require
talk
be
recess
until
the
mediation
service
believe
they
could
be
useful
in
the
meantime
we
try
to
negotiate
with
the
other
union
but
they
give
precedence
to
a
settlement
between
us
and
the
pressman
so
we
be
stalemate
during
this
period
those
who
have
be
charge
with
the
violence
and
damage
in
the
begin
of
the
strike
be
call
before
a
grand
jury
every
one
of
them
plead
the
fifth
amendment
as
do
dugan
who
say
he
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
violence
in
the
pressroom
from
the
begin
he
claimed
that
the
riot
be
unplanned
a
simple
emotional
outburst
by
craftsman
who
felt
frustrate
and
be
overwrought
prosecutor
be
consider
grant
selective
immunity
in
exchange
for
information
and
threaten
to
prosecute
the
pressman
for
contempt
if
they
continued
to
refuse
to
testify
we
be
now
in
december
with
virtually
no
movement
although
we
have
put
forth
another
offer
which
the
pressman
have
ignore
the
strike
have
be
go
on
for
nine
week
during
which
we
have
make
several
offer
of
generous
benefit
and
certain
job
guarantee
and
security
in
exchange
for
modification
of
unacceptable
work
practice
finally
the
pressman
make
their
first
offer
orally
not
in
write
propose
only
one
minor
change
in
work
practice
for
which
they
ask
an
additional
a
week
obviously
we
be
still
far
apart
the
next
day
december
be
important
because
we
make
a
final
offer
to
keep
the
whole
thing
from
drag
on
we
have
decide
to
make
what
mark
call
the
comprehensive
definitive
and
final
settlement
offer
this
be
an
offer
that
i
believe
be
generous
a
pressman
s
base
pay
would
have
go
immediately
to
high
than
that
of
any
pressman
at
any
other
newspaper
in
the
united
state
at
that
time
it
give
pressman
the
opportunity
to
earn
as
much
as
the
then
current
average
in
the
pressroom
by
work
more
reasonable
hour
only
five
day
a
week
and
more
if
they
chose
reasonable
overtime
the
contract
would
have
end
the
practice
of
back
to
back
shift
we
promise
job
security
and
note
that
any
de
escalation
in
man
the
press
would
be
by
attrition
not
through
firing
there
be
other
add
ons
overtime
holiday
bonus
and
a
package
to
divide
up
it
be
an
offer
the
pressman
could
have
accepted
and
would
have
do
well
to
and
one
that
we
could
live
with
which
the
final
offer
have
to
be
there
be
a
secret
meeting
on
the
eve
of
the
final
contract
offer
but
nothing
happen
dugan
as
usual
be
both
arrogant
and
personal
he
call
mark
meagher
and
larry
wallace
liar
and
told
them
to
tell
katharine
graham
to
take
her
contract
proposal
and
shove
it
we
have
warn
the
union
it
wasn
t
a
threat
or
a
ploy
that
we
thought
this
offer
be
the
best
we
could
come
forward
with
we
reemphasized
as
we
have
steadfastly
maintain
throughout
that
we
consider
the
return
to
work
of
those
pressman
who
cause
the
destruction
in
our
pressroom
nonnegotiable
and
outside
the
bargaining
process
local
vote
to
to
reject
our
offer
why
didn
t
the
pressman
accept
the
contract
i
m
sure
there
be
as
many
answer
as
there
be
individual
pressman
perhaps
they
be
hold
out
hop
we
would
cave
in
and
remember
that
we
always
have
jim
dugan
himself
be
certainly
a
factor
as
be
charlie
davis
of
the
stereotypers
dugan
s
first
henchman
dugan
have
always
be
an
able
leader
but
have
undoubtedly
gotten
an
inflate
ego
from
his
perceive
victory
over
john
prescott
the
night
of
the
wildcat
strike
in
he
seem
to
believe
that
he
be
the
strong
man
in
the
building
and
could
always
make
management
back
down
in
the
end
he
project
the
attitude
that
he
be
go
to
fix
us
to
show
the
management
of
the
washington
post
company
who
be
really
in
charge
not
only
would
there
be
no
concession
but
in
fact
he
be
out
to
make
far
gain
from
this
the
union
never
waver
through
the
entire
strike
to
some
extent
dugan
be
a
prisoner
of
his
power
and
successful
past
and
of
the
people
who
do
the
damage
he
have
to
ask
us
to
take
back
the
men
who
damage
our
press
we
steadfastly
refuse
after
the
overwhelm
turndown
of
our
final
offer
by
the
union
it
be
a
question
of
when
not
if
to
announce
that
we
would
start
hire
replacement
worker
this
be
the
most
sensitive
and
frighten
moment
of
the
whole
strike
i
have
no
idea
what
the
reaction
might
be
on
the
part
of
the
guild
the
pressman
or
the
many
striker
we
talk
about
the
upcoming
guild
meeting
and
whether
we
should
tempt
fate
by
make
our
announcement
just
before
or
wait
until
just
after
but
there
be
no
perfect
moment
finally
mark
make
the
decision
to
move
ahead
as
quickly
as
possible
and
set
the
date
for
the
eve
of
a
guild
meeting
which
worried
me
considerably
but
which
prove
to
be
a
wise
and
gutsy
judgment
three
day
after
the
pressman
s
union
s
rejection
of
our
final
offer
december
mark
and
i
walk
down
to
the
fifth
floor
newsroom
the
big
available
place
to
a
meeting
of
all
those
still
work
there
i
announce
our
intention
to
hire
replacement
worker
outline
our
attempt
to
negotiate
the
term
of
the
final
offer
i
then
described
the
alternative
to
not
hire
new
pressman
as
the
continued
publication
of
the
paper
by
an
already
exhaust
crew
for
who
knew
how
many
month
emphasize
that
base
on
past
pattern
there
be
no
indication
that
ten
more
week
or
even
ten
more
month
of
bargaining
would
change
any
attitude
continue
to
negotiate
seem
likely
to
lead
only
to
more
sterile
debate
and
as
i
say
to
someone
at
the
time
unjustified
hope
and
add
delay
in
reach
settlement
with
the
other
union
the
truth
be
that
as
far
as
the
pressman
be
concerned
it
be
just
too
late
i
told
those
gather
in
the
newsroom
that
member
of
local
be
be
inform
by
letter
that
if
our
contract
offer
be
not
approve
by
midnight
of
the
next
sunday
four
day
later
we
would
begin
hire
permanent
replacement
i
add
that
the
pressman
as
individual
with
the
exception
of
those
who
have
be
know
to
participate
in
the
violence
could
return
to
their
job
in
the
pressroom
i
also
try
to
speak
directly
to
member
of
the
other
craft
union
emphasize
that
we
want
to
reach
agreement
as
speedily
as
possible
with
all
those
union
whose
contract
have
expire
on
september
i
knew
this
action
be
legal
but
as
i
told
those
gather
there
that
morning
it
be
more
important
for
me
to
think
about
whether
it
be
humanly
right
in
the
end
i
say
to
the
gathering
like
the
decision
make
by
each
of
you
who
continued
to
work
in
the
strike
my
decision
be
neither
simple
nor
easy
and
like
your
decision
it
require
me
to
weigh
the
claim
of
a
variety
of
responsibility
my
conclusion
be
that
i
cannot
in
conscience
permit
a
situation
to
continue
in
which
men
and
woman
in
our
trade
union
many
of
whom
have
work
here
for
many
year
be
face
with
a
bleak
future
because
they
must
honor
the
picket
line
of
a
group
of
men
who
be
the
high
paid
craft
union
worker
in
the
building
these
member
of
our
other
union
have
already
forfeit
many
hundred
of
thousand
of
dollar
in
wage
for
the
sake
of
strike
pressman
who
continue
to
draw
pay
for
their
work
at
other
newspaper
who
create
this
situation
by
their
irresponsible
and
violent
act
and
who
have
reject
out
of
hand
an
offer
which
would
have
make
them
the
best
paid
and
most
financially
secure
member
of
their
craft
work
at
any
paper
in
this
country
i
conclude
by
say
it
be
a
sober
moment
for
this
place
and
for
all
of
us
the
consequence
of
what
we
have
be
force
to
do
have
be
thought
about
hard
i
believe
we
have
do
what
be
responsible
and
right
for
the
paper
for
the
union
people
who
work
here
for
the
honor
of
the
institution
itself
and
for
the
community
we
serve
my
statement
be
greet
by
tense
silence
mark
follow
up
the
two
of
us
take
a
few
question
and
then
left
the
next
day
the
post
ran
a
full
page
open
letter
from
mark
title
why
the
washington
post
have
take
action
to
end
the
strike
and
return
to
normal
operation
which
be
ted
van
dyk
s
work
we
also
ran
an
ad
in
the
classify
section
of
the
paper
for
immediate
opening
for
experienced
or
inexperienced
production
personnel
for
the
pressroom
to
our
amazement
early
the
next
morning
there
be
about
seven
hundred
people
line
up
in
front
of
the
building
to
be
interviewed
in
the
end
we
have
a
thousand
applicant
from
whom
we
hire
very
carefully
and
at
first
very
slowly
a
cross
section
of
people
right
off
the
street
and
some
who
have
work
at
the
paper
during
the
strike
our
first
hire
be
a
black
man
who
have
stood
on
the
line
in
silver
platform
shoe
dress
in
a
long
fur
coat
one
of
the
first
of
the
new
pressman
be
diane
elmore
now
patterson
formerly
from
advertising
sale
who
have
work
on
the
press
throughout
the
strike
like
it
so
much
that
she
chose
to
switch
job
she
be
now
an
assistant
superintendent
for
the
mailroom
at
our
springfield
plant
there
be
several
vietnamese
men
who
have
work
around
the
building
in
various
temporary
capacity
who
be
hire
and
become
star
performer
one
of
the
fine
thing
jim
cooper
have
do
be
to
meet
at
my
farm
in
virginia
with
six
of
the
pressroom
supervisor
who
be
union
member
invite
them
to
return
to
work
they
agree
to
come
back
in
which
they
do
only
after
we
go
to
impasse
and
have
start
hire
and
eventually
help
with
training
the
new
people
their
return
be
a
great
step
forward
for
us
but
a
difficult
one
for
them
they
be
all
visibly
shaken
pale
and
frighten
in
their
first
day
back
on
the
job
we
brought
in
two
people
to
begin
training
our
new
pressman
in
a
rigorous
two
week
training
program
we
have
to
low
our
standard
a
little
to
go
faster
but
we
found
such
highly
motivate
and
qualify
people
that
they
rise
rapidly
through
the
rank
i
have
be
concerned
that
there
would
be
violent
confrontation
between
the
picket
and
the
applicant
to
my
surprise
there
be
none
you
might
have
have
two
hundred
press
operator
picket
out
there
who
be
fearful
for
their
job
recall
jim
cooper
later
but
you
have
seven
hundred
people
many
of
whom
be
black
out
there
hop
for
job
that
black
hadn
t
even
be
allow
to
think
about
it
would
have
take
a
very
stupid
person
to
try
to
oppose
them
pressure
rise
on
us
after
the
announcement
about
hire
mark
don
and
i
be
call
to
go
before
the
d
c
city
council
to
answer
question
dugan
have
ask
for
a
meeting
with
the
council
and
have
actually
say
i
use
to
live
in
d
c
for
whatever
that
s
worth
to
which
council
chairman
sterling
tucker
have
say
that
s
not
worth
anything
again
the
racial
issue
help
counteract
the
general
pro
union
sympathy
because
when
we
inform
tucker
that
there
be
no
black
in
the
union
he
conclude
it
be
a
racist
union
and
decide
not
to
help
the
pressman
in
any
way
the
president
of
the
great
washington
central
labor
council
ask
me
to
meet
with
mayor
walter
washington
and
jim
dugan
accuse
us
of
import
strikebreaker
by
this
time
we
have
have
to
borrow
a
few
pressman
from
other
paper
and
i
explain
by
letter
why
we
have
have
to
do
this
note
that
we
never
brought
in
relief
pressman
until
we
go
to
impasse
in
december
when
our
people
be
exhaust
i
add
that
i
couldn
t
see
that
the
mayor
s
presence
would
change
a
situation
of
basic
wide
disagreement
between
the
post
and
local
especially
since
the
mediation
service
have
participate
from
the
begin
there
never
be
a
meeting
just
at
this
time
more
than
fifteen
hundred
demonstrator
stag
a
rally
parade
past
the
building
to
show
solidarity
with
the
union
several
of
us
inside
the
building
be
cluster
discreetly
hidden
at
an
upstairs
window
to
watch
the
approach
parade
i
be
dismayed
to
see
charlie
davis
at
the
head
of
the
group
with
a
sign
that
read
in
big
letter
phil
shot
the
wrong
graham
i
cringed
and
ran
from
the
window
i
couldn
t
believe
that
charlie
and
i
have
once
be
on
friendly
jocular
term
oddly
the
pressman
still
didn
t
seem
to
feel
threaten
not
even
after
our
hire
begin
they
act
as
though
they
believe
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
they
d
be
come
back
in
in
many
way
this
attitude
may
have
be
a
reflection
of
how
unreal
dugan
s
perspective
be
from
the
begin
he
appear
not
to
think
that
we
could
actually
be
run
the
press
even
when
the
picketers
heard
the
noise
of
the
press
he
would
insist
we
be
somehow
fake
it
as
we
get
strong
and
strong
he
kept
deny
our
success
as
late
as
the
end
of
december
dugan
claimed
on
radio
and
television
that
our
statement
about
the
post
s
circulation
be
mislead
and
way
off
base
assert
that
we
be
dump
thousand
of
copy
of
the
daily
paper
in
fact
by
this
time
daily
circulation
be
down
by
only
about
twenty
five
thousand
copy
and
sunday
circulation
by
just
twelve
thousand
we
have
reach
percent
of
expectation
for
this
time
of
year
despite
their
seem
to
believe
that
time
be
on
their
side
the
pressman
appeal
to
george
meany
afl
cio
president
for
help
he
in
turn
call
me
and
say
katharine
the
pressman
have
call
and
want
me
to
talk
to
you
i
confess
that
my
heart
sank
at
his
call
meany
could
have
seriously
hurt
us
by
start
boycott
and
apply
other
political
pressure
in
essence
by
get
behind
the
pressman
s
union
he
ask
me
if
i
want
him
to
come
to
the
post
to
talk
i
knew
meany
through
my
father
who
have
serve
with
him
on
the
war
labor
board
i
respect
him
and
like
him
and
knew
that
he
couldn
t
possibly
cross
the
picket
line
so
i
told
him
i
d
go
to
him
which
i
do
on
december
take
mark
along
with
me
to
meany
s
office
only
a
couple
of
block
away
when
we
be
seat
george
get
right
down
to
business
ask
would
you
take
the
pressman
back
if
they
paid
to
fix
the
press
no
i
reply
unequivocally
the
press
be
fix
we
have
already
hire
half
the
people
we
need
it
s
too
late
to
take
them
back
we
can
t
have
them
work
side
by
side
with
nonunion
people
would
you
take
them
back
if
george
kept
raise
the
ante
in
one
question
after
another
i
kept
explain
that
we
have
cross
the
bridge
they
hadn
t
respond
to
any
invitation
to
negotiate
and
now
we
be
launch
on
another
path
finally
he
pose
the
ultimate
difficult
question
what
would
you
do
if
they
accepted
the
contract
legally
of
course
if
they
have
at
any
time
accepted
the
final
contract
they
would
have
be
eligible
for
the
remain
job
i
take
a
deep
breath
let
my
intuition
take
over
and
reply
i
guess
i
d
slit
my
throat
from
ear
to
ear
there
be
a
deafen
silence
for
a
moment
while
george
star
at
me
and
mark
go
limp
look
as
though
he
be
go
to
slide
right
off
the
couch
on
which
we
both
be
sit
but
i
knew
george
and
i
thought
i
could
level
with
him
and
that
be
the
truth
i
also
knew
that
he
would
understand
what
i
meant
he
be
very
political
with
sensitive
antenna
finally
he
reflect
sadly
well
i
offer
to
help
the
pressman
when
this
strike
first
start
i
sent
them
a
wire
and
they
never
reply
also
i
just
can
t
imagine
people
who
would
destroy
their
tool
i
ve
never
approve
of
that
that
would
never
have
happen
in
my
day
we
talk
a
little
longer
then
mark
and
i
rise
to
leave
meany
walk
with
us
to
the
elevator
slowly
and
sorrowfully
as
we
be
get
in
he
say
to
me
the
post
be
a
great
newspaper
and
i
knew
and
love
your
father
just
before
christmas
we
have
our
first
big
break
when
the
paper
handler
who
push
the
huge
and
heavy
newsprint
roll
to
the
press
a
job
that
be
then
be
do
by
don
graham
mark
meagher
and
others
settle
their
contract
the
first
union
to
do
so
to
the
public
this
didn
t
quite
count
as
a
breakthrough
however
because
the
pressman
s
and
other
union
condescend
to
them
the
paper
handler
be
all
black
and
low
skilled
be
slightly
different
from
the
other
craft
but
from
our
point
of
view
it
be
a
break
and
it
relieve
us
considerably
at
the
same
time
the
regional
director
of
the
national
labor
relation
board
refuse
to
issue
a
complaint
file
by
the
union
accuse
us
of
delay
or
stall
tactic
and
refuse
to
bargain
in
good
faith
still
the
tension
be
high
the
pressman
s
wife
start
to
write
me
christmas
eve
a
day
i
never
dream
would
find
us
still
in
this
strike
situation
be
hard
for
all
of
us
ben
s
annual
letter
to
me
be
especially
poignant
and
understand
he
acknowledge
that
he
felt
i
would
never
do
anything
more
difficult
he
be
so
right
he
also
say
that
his
own
new
year
s
wish
be
to
have
the
turmoil
end
so
that
we
can
return
to
our
task
of
put
out
the
best
paper
in
the
world
without
compromise
and
without
menace
i
think
the
strike
be
especially
difficult
on
ben
he
himself
admit
later
i
have
never
be
comfortable
in
or
with
the
labor
movement
whereas
i
have
be
living
through
these
month
with
people
who
be
of
one
mind
he
have
have
to
live
each
day
with
people
who
be
torment
by
what
they
be
do
in
not
support
the
union
reporter
who
have
to
be
calm
and
reassure
constantly
i
also
recognize
that
what
i
be
do
in
try
to
change
the
labor
situation
be
something
i
have
be
work
on
for
year
whereas
for
ben
the
strike
be
nothing
but
a
mammoth
interruption
of
what
he
have
be
try
to
do
for
the
past
decade
in
respond
to
ben
i
share
with
him
my
view
about
how
it
would
turn
out
i
know
it
s
go
to
be
good
well
than
you
think
from
every
point
of
view
i
pray
it
s
over
before
too
long
but
it
would
be
fatal
to
try
to
push
it
faster
than
it
can
go
on
new
year
s
eve
to
my
great
distress
and
anger
the

from

urge

if

i
believe
that
all
the

be
use
although
many
of
them
didn
t
realize
it
they
thought
the
position
be
a
neutral
one
that
we
have
won
the
strike
but
should
now
submit
to
an
arbitrator
what
we
have
already
won
they
have
little
idea
what
the
real
issue
be
but
have
simply
let
themselves
be
duped
by
the

fact

be
paid
for
by

our
side

write
back

he
have
thought
the
open

nothing

an
appeal
to
both
the
post
and
the
union
to
try
to
settle
the
dispute
and
he
still
didn
t
think
it
take
side
he
add
however
on
second
thought
it
would
have
be
well
if
i
have
kept
my
nose
out
of
the
dispute
it
be
one
of
those
hasty
decision
and
i
suppose
one
that
i
would
have
be
much
well
off
never
to
have
make
apologize
if
it
have
cause

between
essential

spent
three
hour
one
afternoon
at
my

while
he
argue
the
necessity
of
take
the
pressman
s

back
and
i
try
to
explain
why
that
couldn
t
happen
my
difference
with
joe
reflect
one
of
the
irony
of
the
pressman
s
strike
it
be
difficult
to
find
myself
be
view
as
antilabor
and
it
be
strange
for
me
to
find
in
my
camp
many
people
who
normally
would
have
be
on
the
directly
opposite
side
of
the
mat
and
the
reverse
as
well
with
many
of
my
friend
take
a
position
contrary
to
mine
this
strange
switch
be
reflect
in
various
situation
throughout
those
long
month
of
the
strike
for
example
pat
buchanan
never
one
to
support
the
washington
post
write
at
the
time
that
although
the
company
be
a
medium
cartel
which
ought
to
be
broken
up
and
although
the
paper
s
editorial
policy
have
encourage
the
shift
of
economic
power
toward
big
labor
its
fight
with
local
be
a
fight
it
have
to
win
he
manage
to
add
about
the
company
it
probably
deserves
what
it
get
by
january
we
have
hire
people
as
permanent
replacement
for
the
pressroom
with

with
almost
percent

the
issue
now
be
to
get
the

make
the

the
emotional
stress

epitomize
on

of

when
your
greed
for
more

make
you

you
accepted
the
moral
responsibility
for
all
the
inevitable
human
consequence
which
flow
from
this
decision
your
yellow

to
lie
your

out
from
this
moral
responsibility
by
printing
in
your
paper
he
be
afraid
to
cross
the

be
the
low
insult
you
could
have
make
to
a
man
and
his

be
strong

for
over

blood
be
on
your

i
draft
a
response
that
i
never
sent
perhaps
because
i
be
try
to
be
rational
in
what
be
an
emotionally
charge
environment
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
reason
the

story
that
have
appear
in
the

say
john

that
that
be
what
his
suicide
note
have
say
in
the
end
i
saw
no
point
in
respond
to
what
i
view
as
intemperate
and
unfounded
accusation
february
be
possibly
the
key
moment
in
the
denouement
of
the
strike
the
mailer
finally
vote
to
to
accept
a
new
contract
and
report
for

the
next
night
on
february
the

chapel
of
the
photoengravers
union
vote
to
accept
our
contract
offer
and
return
to
work
a
few
day
later
the
typographer
who
be
observe
the
picket
line
but
be
not
on
strike
since
they
have
a

come
back
in
with

we

of

bob
kaiser
who
have
be
cover
the
strike
write
a
long
piece
about
everything
that
have
take
place
which
take
over
much
of
the
outlook
section
of
the
paper
because
it
be
a
remarkably
detach
piece
of
reporting
it
be
widely
applaud
i
didn
t
agree
with
all
that
bob
write
but
i
believe
newspaper
have
to
let
themselves
be
write
about
and
have
to
live
with
it
naturally
there
have
be
a
lot
of
press
reaction
to
the
strike
during
those
long
month
it
range
from
very
positive
to
the
other
extreme
one
of
the
bad
story
ran
in
the
begin
by
eliot

in
the

the
time
i
call
him
and
say
that
some
of
what
he
d
say
be
demonstrably
wrong
and
i
could
prove
it
he
say
he
be
so
sorry
but
he
have
it
from
an
impeccable
source
the

about
what
have
brought
us
to
this
dreadful
mess
hoot
recall
the
early
day
of
the
post
in
the
old
e
street
building
when
we
all
enjoy
our
work
and
each
other
we
use
to
come
in
fifteen
minute
early
just
to
visit
before
we
go
to
work
he
remember
and
he
emphasize
how
much
easy
it
be
to
relate
to
each
other
when
the
paper
be
small
it
s
interest
that
on
one
night
we
have
twenty
three
amateur
run
the
mailroom
and
the
very
next
night
there
be
sixty
nine
people
man
the
same
equipment
we
handle
the
return
to
work
very
carefully
not
press
people
who
be
slow
to
come
back
we
want
to
bind
up
wound
not
create
more
we
try
to
welcome
everyone
back
into
the
building
we
try
not
to
gloat
although
there
be
many
uncertainty
at
the
post
include
the
cost
of
buying
out
some
of
the
printer
and
get
back
some
of
the
linage
lose
during
the
strike
we
have
begin
to
resume
normal
operation
despite
the
three
month
of
the
strike
at
the
end
of
the
year
we
have
actually
finish
with
an
increase
share
of
the
sunday
field
in
washington
and
with
total
post
linage
down
less
than
percent
we
still
have
to
come
to
work
through
what
be
an
increasingly
forlorn
picket
line
which
be
awful
and
pressman
s
wife
and
child
picket
my
house
in
georgetown
every
sunday
for
month
so
i
have
to
drive
in
and
out
past
their
sad
line
which
bother
me
more
than
anyone
will
ever
know
the
picket
line
at
the
post
wasn
t
call
off
until
may

resolutely
harass
us

have
picket
the
opening
of
the
movie

hidden
in
the
audience

and
drown
me
out
i
make
a
few
attempt
to
keep
go
realize
they
be
futile
and
suggest
we
all
join
hand
and
sing
god
bless
america
which
have
be
schedule
for
the
conclusion

of
course
somewhat
nerve
rack
to
have
them
suddenly
appear
from
the
dark
night
and
i
left
as
soon
as
i
could
in

he
have

in

there
be
a
movement
to
get
rid
of
the

and
about
a
third
of
the

mount
a
challenge
to
the

as
the

representative
the
independent

only
narrowly
lose
but
it
do
succeed
in
get
the
international
union
to
realize
it
would
lose
the
post
unless
something
be
do
leader
of
the

persuade
flores
to
resign
as
administrative
officer
and
replace
him
we
have
weather
a
strike
we
hadn
t
ask
for
and
didn
t
control
the
post
have
survive
this
crucial
test
but
there
be
no
clean
victory
it
be
a
painful
one
for
the
post
for
its
guild
and
craft
union
member
and
for
the
washington
community
it
divide
the
paper
create
a
false
atmosphere
of
us
versus
them
nearly
two
hundred
people
lose
their
job
one
commit
suicide
there
be
many
sad
consequence
for
far
too
many
people
and
their
family
i
never
want
the
strike
i
know
that
many
people
believe
i
deliberately
set
out
to
destroy
a
union
but
that
be
certainly
not
the
case
and
if
it
have
be
the
case
it
would
not
have
work
certainly
i
and
everyone
in
the
building
who
be
interested
in
put
out
an
on
time
quality
paper
be
fed
up
with
the
tyranny
which
the
pressman
s
union
have
impose
on
us
over
the
year
but
i
never
dream
it
be
possible
to
replace
the
pressman
nor
do
i
feel
it
be
desirable
most
people
at
the
post
be
still
represent
by
union
as
i
say
early
on
the
washington
post
have
live
long
and
honorably
with
its
union
mark
and
i
both
say
repeatedly
throughout
the
strike
that
we
believe
the
post
benefit
from
strong
healthy
trade
unionism
i
believe
that
then
and
i
believe
it
now
i
felt
this
as
the
publisher
as
well
as
personally
my
father
be
the
only
publisher
ever
make
an
honorary
member
of
the
pressman
s
local
i
myself
have
come
to
maturity
in
an
age
of
strong
labor
i
be
a
believer
in
the
labor
movement
one
of
my
early
aspiration
have
be
to
be
a
labor
reporter
yet
i
also
feel
that
the
union
have
to
stay
productive
and
that
there
be
area
that
need
not
be
unionized
what
i
stand
by
unequivocally
be
that
we
have
no
other
choice
but
to
do
what
we
do
to
take
the
action
we
take
the
future
of
the
post
as
well
as
of
the
post
company
hung
in
the
balance
i
knew
that
we
have
to
have
a
well
run
production
department
all
of
our
job
depend
on
it
i
knew
that
we
have
to
retrieve
management
right
that
have
erode
over
the
year
i
have
always
thought
that
blame
be
divisible
and
i
take
responsibility
for
some
of
the
management
problem
that
lead
to
the
erode
of
our
right
to
run
the
pressroom
others
i
inherit
but
wherever
the
source
of
the
problem
lay
i
knew
they
have
to
be
correct
i
be
also
convince
that
we
set
about
do
this
in
an
enlighten
and
decent
way
i
believe
that
we
offer
a
generous
resolution
from
the
begin
and
throughout
we
want
to
settle
with
the
union
but
we
want
to
settle
responsibly
our
aim
be
always
the
same
we
be
ask
for
the
reasonable
right
to
retrieve
some
of
the
bad
practice
that
have
built
up
over
the
year
we
try
to
be
fair
which
i
know
be
something
many
of
the
pressman
and
their
family
will
never
believe
we
weren
t
ask
the
pressman
merely
to
surrender
the
outmode
practice
to
which
we
object
we
be
prepared
to
give
for
what
we
get
we
would
have
willingly
bought
back
what
we
have
earlier
give
away
the
pressman
s
union
be
not
prepared
to
give
up
anything
the
union
or
at
least
its
leader
dugan
and
davis
seem
to
be
say
what
s
ours
be
ours
and
what
s
yours
be
negotiable
ironically
it
be
the
pressman
themselves
who
make
it
possible
for
us
to
achieve
what
we
have
long
for
i
view
the
strike
as
a
great
tragedy
that
could
have
be
avoid
with
wiser
union
leadership
i
believe
as
i
write
someone
at
the
time
that
local
kill
the
goose
and
its
golden
egg
with
their
unbend
determination
to
keep
it
all
dugan
could
see
that
union
and
management
at
other
paper
be
arrive
at
contract
that
met
the
need
of
both
side
at
the
table
he
could
also
see
that
some
of
the
best
paper
in
the
country
at
the
time
the
los
angeles
time
newsday
and
the
miami
herald
for
example
be
almost
completely
nonunion
but
he
remain
adamant
refuse
to
bargain
reasonably
and
act
responsibly
many
fine
and
able
pressman
be
caught
in
a
bind
of
have
to
resign
from
the
union
or
remain
with
the
leader
who
have
lead
them
so
poorly
and
have
do
such
harm
there
be
undoubtedly
a
tendency
to
think
that
union
must
be
victim
and
therefore
right
and
that
employer
be
probably
brutal
powerful
and
therefore
wrong
i
felt
this
be
a
particularly
serious
misperception
in
our
case
i
understood
people
who
felt
loyal
to
the
union
and
not
to
the
company
when
force
to
make
what
i
knew
be
a
very
hard
choice
and
say
as
much
in
letter
to
the
wife
of
a
few
of
the
pressman
but
i
also
understood
that
it
be
a
choice
these
men
have
make
i
felt
that
the
philosophy
that
any
union
be
right
no
matter
what
it
do
be
an
odd
cause
for
which
to
sacrifice
one
s
career
i
wish
the
pressman
have
influence
their
union
leadership
to
be
responsible
in
the
first
place
fail
that
i
wish
they
have
return
as
individual
unfortunately
many
follow
dugan
over
the
cliff
in
some
way
we
obtain
by
accident
what
be
give
to
few
in
their
life
a
new
chance
though
this
be
a
strike
that
be
not
look
for
it
be
one
that
be
desperately
need
as
i
told
ben
at
the
time
in
an
odd
sense
the
strike
be
a
business
side
watergate
that
fell
on
our
head
but
then
have
to
be
pursue
we
have
want
to
accomplish
gradually
over
many
contract
what
we
be
not
only
enable
but
force
to
do
in
one
blow
as
a
result
of
the
strike
after
year
of
defeat
hope
at
contract
time
after
the
agony
of
concern
about
how
to
turn
around
a
seemingly
impossibly
difficult
mess
in
production
we
be
give
that
rare
and
unexpected
gift
we
all
dream
about
a
clean
slate
on
which
we
could
begin
to
rebuild
we
now
have
settle
our
two
bad
labor
problem
the
itu
and
the
pressman
in
different
way
we
could
begin
to
address
in
a
more
orderly
way
the
rest
of
them
include
the
mailroom
where
there
be
still
featherbed
and
inefficiency
most
important
we
have
gain
the
opportunity
to
deal
more
professionally
with
our
union
and
the
right
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
our
production
management
as
well
as
the
ability
to
manage
we
be
able
to
bring
in
enlighten
modern
manager
particularly
don
rice
and
later
tom
might
who
together
brought
production
from
the
bad
manage
department

it
s
sober
to
look
back
at

and
realize
that
as
with

one
reason
we
survive
be
that
we
be
lucky
grant
we
have
the
strong
will
of
the
people
inside
and
outside
the
building
who
help
us
the
leadership
of
mark
meagher
and
don
graham
as
well
as
the
dedication
and
ability
of
the
nonunion
circulation
department
that
distribute
and
deliver
the
paper
but
we
also
need
some
extraordinarily
lucky
break
and
we
get
them
the
initial
deliberate
destruction
of
the
press
which
seem
at
first
sight
like
such
an
overwhelm
catastrophe
turn
out
to
be
a
blessing
in
disguise
the
damage
and
the
unforgivable
act
of
violence
throughout
the
strike
help
greatly
with
public
opinion
with
other
newspaper
that
come
to
our
aid
and
above
all
with
keep
the
guild
work
the
rampage
that
some
of
the
pressman
go
on
straighten
our
spine
on
the
management
side
it
make
us
very
determine
to
come
to
term
with
the
arrogance
that
it
reflect
at
the
time
i
be
both
angry
and
baffle
about
the
violence
why
do
they
do
it
only
in
hindsight
do
i
come
to
understand
it
to
a
certain
extent
although
never
to
accept
it
dugan
and
davis
knew
that
in
order
to
prevail
they
have
to
shut
off
either
our
mean
of
distribute
the
paper
or
our
mean
of
produce
it
because
our
distributor
be
independent
operator
the
union
have
no
other
option
than
to
focus
on
our
mean
of
production
the
press
also
there
have
be
a
strike
at
a
newspaper
in
kansa
city
and
that
paper
have
replace
its
strike
pressman
the
day
after
they
struck
and
the
union
have
never
go
back
in
august
just
over
a
month
before
our
own
strike
begin
the
head
of
the
kansa
city
pressman
s
union
make
a
speech
to
our
local
at
the
post
say
that
their
error
have
be
leave
the
press
intact
and
ready
to
run
i
suppose
dugan
and
davis
decide
not
to
make
that
same
mistake
larry
wallace
suggest
that
dugan
possibly
thought
he
have
figure
out
a
way
to
succeed
where
other
pressman
have
fail
i
believe
that
it
be
the
roughneck
out
of
town
element
of
the
union
who
mapped
out
the
damage
and
sabotage
rather
than
longtime
post
pressman
the
majority
of
whom
i
don
t
think
even
knew
that
the
damage
be
plan
in
fact
everett
ray
forsman
a
union
official
who
played
no
role
in
the
violence
left
the
room
in
tear
after
see
the
extent
of
the
damage
even
the
weather
be
on
our
side
whereas
washington
have
experienced
some
torrential
rain
in
the
late
summer
and
early
fall
the
day
remain
fairly
clear
throughout
the
strike
which
allow
the
helicopter
to
fly
in
and
out
regularly
without
be
ground
though
the
strike
at
the
washington
post
end
for
the
most
part
in
february
its
reverberation
be
felt
to
this
day
we
learn
a
lot
of
necessary
albeit
painful
lesson
about
the
need
for
strong
and
compassionate
manager
who
be
knowledgeable
about
the
task
at
hand
about
labor
relation
and
about
communication
and
we
put
what
we
learn
to
good
use
there
be
extraordinarily
positive
outcome
for
the
company
in
great
efficiency
and
flexibility
and
in
the
ability
to
manage
our
increase
productivity
be
evident
in
the
pressroom
where
we
go
from
seventeen
pressman
on
each
press
before
the
strike
to
eight
to
ten
person
crew
afterwards
press
speed
increase
for
us
it
be
the
equivalent
of
buying
another
press
our
pressroom
begin
function
again
the
way
a
pressroom
should
and
the
atmosphere
improve
throughout
the
building
as
a
manager
i
have
learn
the
hard
way
that
when
management
for
whatever
reason
forfeit
its
basic
right
to
manage
only
trouble
can
result
the
strike
make
me
more
determine
to
establish
well
communication
within
the
company
and
the
result
be
a
well
strong
newspaper
without
the
groundwork
laid
by
the
strike
we
would
not
have
be
able
to
build
and
to
grow
we
bound
back
from
the
trauma
of
the
strike
because
the
post
be
a
good
newspaper
to
begin
with
one
that
people
like
and
because
our
regain
control
over
the
pressroom
meant
that
we
could
print
and
deliver
the
paper
on
time
something
we
hadn
t
be
do
for
year
it
be
ironic
that
i
who
have
never
like
confrontation
should
have
be
face
with
this
major
one
my
mother
rarely
do
thing
tactfully
or
in
a
low
key
way
she
love
and
thrive
on
strident
confrontation
perhaps
for
that
reason
i
always
ran
the
other
way
when
it
come
to
a
showdown
i
hat
fight
which
i
always
found
unpleasant
and
invariably
fear
lose
on
the
other
hand
in
this
big
one
when
i
be
corner
i
have
no
choice
but
to
become
embattle
i
know
that
i
risk
sound
pretentious
or
sanctimonious
when
i
say
that
at
bottom
i
regard
the
action
we
take
as
fulfil
our
obligation
to
our
reader
but
i
ll
take
the
risk
and
say
that
for
me
it
be
true
yet
even
when
it
be
over
i
have
mixed
feeling
it
s
an
awful
thing
i
write
a
friend
in
february
to
find
yourself
engage
in
and
curiously
emotionally
bad
in
victory
than
in
battle
it
be
as
i
also
say
equally
awful
to
meet
people
who
believe
the
propaganda
emanate
from
a
coalition
of
enemy
that
i
have
suddenly
gotten
money
grub
and
heartless
i
emerge
from
the
strike
with
a
high
profile
than
ever
before
though
at
the
post
and
in
the
community
some
people
may
have
have
mixed
feeling
about
me
within
the
industry
my
star
have
risen
even
those
publisher
who
denounce
the
so
call
liberalism
of
the
post
s
news
and
editorial
page
applaud
our
action
on
the
management
side
to
say
that
i
be
grateful
to
many
people
be
a
supreme
understatement
i
be
indebted
to
mark
meagher
for
his
strength
and
his
many
ability
throughout
those
long
month
don
make
me
proud
as
a
publisher
and
as
a
mother
larry
wallace
prove
himself
to
be
a
man
of
great
competence
and
common
sense
he
have
my
confidence
throughout
the
negotiation
people
in
the
industry
although
they
may
have
help
for
the
common
good
be
still
extraordinarily
generous
to
take
on
our
problem
those
post
people
who
work
so
hard
at
their
own
job
by
day
and
other
job
by
night
do
work
normally
do
by
nearly
fifteen
hundred
full
and
part
time
production
people
earn
my
undying
respect
and
affection
i
have
always
consider
the
daily
paper
a
miracle
of
sort
but
never
more
so
than
during
the
strike
chapter
twenty
seven
in
certain
way
the
define
period
of
my
work
life
be
over
during
the
turbulent
year
from
to
we
have
be
through
the
major
public
drama
of
the
pentagon
paper
watergate
and
the
pressman
s
strike
ironically
it
be
the
next
five
year
that
be
the
most
difficult
work
year
i
ever
live
through
i
sometimes
felt
as
if
i
be
be
make
to
pay
for
have
survive
those
earlier
event
relatively
unscathed
i
still
saw
myself
as
an
inheritor
who
have
be
very
lucky
but
fortunately
after
the
year
of
public
trauma
i
have
a
fairly
steady
platform
on
which
to
operate
the
company
s
primary
business
the
post
newsweek
and
post
newsweek
station
be
all
generally
progress
but
i
still
tend
to
exaggerate
the
thing
that
be
go
wrong
despite
the
recent
success
my
confidence
never
solid
be
shaken
particularly
as
i
begin
to
be
write
about
more
and
more
for
my
real
and
perceive
mistake
warren
s
advice
and
steady
communication
with
me
be
critical
to
a
number
of
action
i
take
in
these
year
crucially
he
persuade
me
of
the
benefit
of
buying
in
our
own
stock
i
have
be
suspicious
of
the
idea
repurchase
stock
be
a
commonplace
today
but
only
a
handful
of
company
be
do
it
in
the
mid
s
i
felt
that
if
we
spent
all
of
our
money
buying
in
our
own
stock
we
wouldn
t
be
able
to
grow
warren
go
through
the
number
with
me
show
me
what
this
action
could
do
for
the
company
in
the
long
run
or
even
in
the
short
run
he
reemphasized
how
low
the
stock
be
compare
with
its
real
value
and
how
this
be
a
well
business
move
than
many
we
be
contemplate
he
gradually
make
his
point
if
we
bought
in
percent
of
the
stock
in
the
post
company
everyone
own
a
large
share
of
our
stock
at
a
bargain
price
i
decide
we
should
do
it
my
natural
caution
however
be
such
that
i
thought
i
have
to
convince
the
people
around
me
of
the
importance
of
such
a
move
so
i
set
about
persuade
the
top
executive
include
the
company
s
legal
counsel
of
the
rightness
of
this
decision
finally
we
agree
and
take
it
to
the
board
who
okayed
the
stock
repurchase
in
fact
the
board
quickly
saw
what
a
good
idea
this
be
and
didn
t
want
to
stop
over
the
next
twenty
year
we
bought
back
percent
of
the
stock
my
management
trouble
may
have
derive
mainly
from
my
lack
of
business
experience
but
they
be
multiply
by
not
have
a
real
partner
to
help
me
run
the
company
by
the
time
of
the
strike
it
be
clear
that
larry
israel
who
have
be
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
the
company
since
fritz
s
death
in
be
not
work
out
when
i
conclude
after
a
great
deal
of
consultation
that
this
situation
just
wouldn
t
get
well
we
make
a
decision
to
part
way
and
announce
larry
s
resignation
in
january
of
when
he
left
i
take
back
the
title
of
president
retain
the
chairmanship
of
the
company
as
well
until
we
decide
what
to
do
about
a
new
coo
the
announcement
of
larry
s
departure
be
greet
with
a
batch
of
negative
story
of
which
i
be
the
target
time
s
piece
on
the
move
be
title
krusty
kay
tightens
her
grip
after
describe
me
as
difficult
to
get
along
with
mercurial
impulsive
manipulate
by
an
eminence
grise
meaning
warren

conclude
by
acknowledge
whatever
the
problem
graham
s
company
will
show
record
profit
and
record
revenue
i
particularly
detest
the
sexist
implication
of
story
like
these
always
be
depict
as
the
difficult
woman
while
whoever
left
the
company
be
the
victim
of
my
female
whim
i
be
still
a
curiosity
a
woman
in
a
man
s
world
men
like
bill
paley
al
neuharth
mort
zuckerman
and
joe
allbritton
fire
executive
after
executive
but
no
one
attribute
their
action
to
their
gender
also
at
this
time
i
have
some
grave
concern
about
the
quality
of
the
paper
and
of
the
edit
i
felt
that
the
national
staff
and
the
metro
staff
have
let
down
that
we
be
do
thing
superficially
ben
didn
t
agree
with
me
but
bob
woodward
do
put
it
succinctly
one
day
the
paper
be
go
down
the
shit
hole
it
be
to
ben
s
great
credit
that
he
and
i
survive
the
difficult
time
and
all
my
question
i
could
still
come
on
like
a
dentist
drill
at
moment
like
this
but
he
hung
in
and
balance
would
get
restore
sometimes
he
would
do
thing
despite
my
view
and
sometimes
he
be
right
to
do
so
if
he
be
mistaken
he
would
correct
the
mistake
in
time
as
soon
as
he
agree
that
something
wasn
t
work
not
listen
to
me
and
to
others
be
both
ben
s
strength
and
his
weakness
however
as
i
write
him
at
the
time
of
this
disagreement
about
the
quality
of
the
paper
no
superficial
problem
either
of
us
may
have
at
any
particular
moment
matter
compare
to
the
basic
trust
and
rapport
with
each
other
because
if
that
s
there
and
it
be
there
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
all
else
flow
from
it
another
area
i
be
worried
about
at
the
post

to
go
into
a
prolong
slump

though
i
felt
the

need
revitalize
i
have
confidence
in
his
ability
to
do

to
him
about
how
the
complexity
of
my

and
the
pressure
on
my
time
have
left

out
of

with

at

good
on
the

however
be
the
begin
of
some
high
level
management
turnover
that
affected
both
the

personally
in

of
that

i
have
to
let
him
go
and
not
just
on
sabbatical
our
mutual

i

gratitude
for

by
peter
derow
who
have
come
to
newsweek
straight
out
of
harvard
business
school
in
peter
be
i
thought
an
able
ambitious
attractive
young
man
who
knew
his
business
i
saw
him
or
talk
to
him
frequently
believe
in
him
thought
of
him
as
an
associate
i
could
lean
on
and
view
him
as
the
promise
of
the
future
although
i
consider
myself
inadequately
educate
and
experienced
for
the
role
i
be
play
i
do
think
i
be
pretty
good
at
appraise
people
and
their
performance
in
fact
peter
s
performance
be
fine
in
many
way
and
he
have
smoothly
work
his
way
up
to
the
number
two
position
under
bob
campbell
i
have
realize
that
he
be
highly
political
never
a
healthy
sign
but
i
be
stun
one
day
in
the
middle
of
when
he
told
me
he
be
leave
to
become
an
administrative
vice
president
at
cbs
i
be
disappointed
by
that
but
he
didn
t
stop
there
go
on
to
tell
me
that
he
want
to
be
in
a
healthy
vibrant
well
run
company
as
oppose
to
the
poorly
run
one
i
be
operating
he
say
that
he
felt
i
be
a
hopelessly
inadequate
leader
and
that
he
have
little
choice
but
to
leave
for
the
dynamic
cbs
he
touch
a
raw
sensitivity
when
he
assault
me
for
not
be
a
professional
manager
and
i
must
confess
that
i
wept
on
and
off
for
at
least
two
day
i
didn
t
acknowledge
to
myself
that
his
be
a
highly
irregular
way
to
leave
a
company
in
which
he
have
achieve
success
and
that
have
do
well
by
him
for
twelve
year
embarrass
as
i
be
to
admit
it
i
worried
so
much
about
lose
this
man
that
i
actually
offer
him
the
presidency
of
the
entire
post
company
if
he
would
stay
peter
be
determine
to
leave
however
and
told
me
it
would
take
too
much
out
of
him
to
take
on
the
job
he
be
thirty
seven
at
the
time
i
believe
the
issue
he
say
wasn
t
a
specific
position
or
a
title
at
the
company
but
rather
do
i
want
to
spend
the
next
ten
year
educate
myself
and
educate
the
family
as
to
how
this
business
ought
to
be
run
he
add
that
to
stay
at
the
washington
post
company
would
take
someone
with
much
more
patience
than
i
have
a
few
week
later
he
depart
with
encomium
from
us
elaborate
speech
from
me
about
how
wonderful
he
be
privately
i
knew
that
i
wouldn
t
soon
forget
the
personal
verbal
lash
i
have
take
from
him
and
i
worried
about
how
right
he
might
have
be
in
one
of
the
more
bizarre
event
of
my
work
life
just
six
month
later
peter
and
i
have
lunch
together
in
new
york
and
he
sound
me
out
about
return
to
newsweek
unaccountably
stupidly
despite
the
powerfully
deflate
effect
of
all
he
have
say
to
me
i
say
yes
right
away
and
welcome
him
back
especially
since
we
have
not
yet
found
his
successor
in
another
month
he
be
once
again
president
of
newsweek
at
the
company
in
corporate
from
the
time
of
larry
israel
s
departure
in
february
until
close
to
the
end
of
that
year
i
be
essentially
alone
as
both
chairman
and
president
and
be
still
the
publisher
of
the
post
but
warren
be
support
me
figuratively
at
least
on
one
side
and
don
graham
be
grow
increasingly
important
on
the
other
and
at
the
end
of
we
have
promote
mark
meagher
to
president
of
the
newspaper
division
simultaneously
mark
name
don
executive
vice
president
and
general
manager
of
the
post
responsible
for
its
day
to
day
operation
in
november
we
promote
mark
to
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
the
entire
company
mark
be
young
and
in
some
respect
short
on
experience
and
maturity
but
he
have
do
a
good
job
for
us
especially
during
the
strike
and
not
be
quite
sure
what
i
be
look
for
i
thought
it
well
to
stay
with
a
know
quantity
in
the
mid
s
my
focus
be
on
how
to
grow
the
company
the
question
of
growth
and
acquisition
have
never
be
address
in
an
orderly
way
neither
fritz
nor
i
have
know
how
to
go
about
it
and
in
fact
have
rather
unqualified
people
passing
judgment
on
important
issue
we
have
little
more
than
a
hit
or
miss
strategy
with
no
logical
point
of
departure
no
consistent
way
of
analyze
possible
purchase
and
no
experience
with
negotiate
target
we
be
aim
at
of
course
at
least
in
the
early
seventy
our
debt
be
still
considerable
and
our
profit
be
not
large
enough
to
give
us
much
leeway
to
grow
so
in
some
way
the
point
be
moot
but
i
want
to
be
poise
for
growth
when
the
opportunity
present
itself
basically
i
be
baffle
even
about
how
to
organize
a
group
to
think
about
expansion
as
it
be
one
person
might
make
a
suggestion
and
the
idea
would
lie
on
the
table
while
several
of
us
chewed
on
it
in
mostly
un
analytical
way
at
one
moment
in
mid
joel
chaseman
president
of
post
newsweek
station
and
mark
meagher
among
others
be
push
for
us
to
undertake
a
cable
news
network
i
disapprove
of
the
idea
for
us
but
there
be
such
a
head
of
steam
that
i
let
them
present
it
to
the
board
which
turn
it
down
although
their
memory
and
mine
be
at
odds
about
the
chronology
of
all
this
i
thought
that
the
idea
have
not
only
already
be
conceive
by
ted
turner
but
have
begin
to
be
implement
he
be
very
determinedly
barreling
ahead
even
though
his
network
be
not
yet
launch
there
clearly
wasn
t
room
for
two
such
enterprise
if
there
be
room
for
one
a
real
concern
of
mine
at
the
time
in
fact
it
take
many
year
for
turner
s
cable
news
network
to
become
a
success
and
only
now
be
several
other
company
enter
the
field
i
start
to
look
into
property
that
i
d
hear
be
available
warren
be
of
especial
help
on
acquisition
know
to
some
degree
about
almost
every
deal
that
be
take
place
or
have
take
place
in
the
previous
ten
year
one
potential
acquisition
we
consider
be
a
television
station
in
buffalo
warren
advise
me
that
the
newspaper
which
be
also
for
sale
would
be
a
well
buy
and
if
we
didn
t
want
it
he
do
although
dominant
in
its
market
the
paper
have
strong
competition
strong
union
and
no
sunday
edition
when
we
decide
not
to
pursue
it
warren
bought
it
and
after
considerable
struggle
manage
it
to
great
success
i
still
feel
we
make
the
right
decision
for
us
how
ill
prepared
we
be
to
manage
another
small
paper
be
amply
demonstrate
by
the
problem
we
be
have
with
the
trenton
time
which
we
have
bought
in
the
spring
of
i
have
share
with
warren
a
memo
describe
and
evaluate
the
deal
and
use
some
valuation
parameter
that
cause
him
consternation
though
he
didn
t
mention
it
at
the
time
obviously
we
hadn
t
do
sufficient
research
into
the
market
nowhere
in
the
memo
accord
to
warren
be
there
any
indication
that
trenton
be
not
a
single
newspaper
town
the
competition
be
a
lively
morning
paper
in
evaluate
the
deal
the
memo
use
illustration
from
monopoly
city
warren
apparently
go
into
orbit
at
the
oversight
but
be
restrain
since
he
wasn
t
yet
on
the
board
we
offer
million
for
the
property
probably
about
million
too
much
i
have
enough
sense
so
that
when
at
the
last
minute
one
of
the
sister
in
the
family
sell
the
paper
want
more
money
and
it
look
as
if
the
deal
might
be
held
up
i
say
good
let
s
can
it
if
they
want
more
money
just
say
no
let
s
use
this
opportunity
to
walk
away
i
have
react
instinctively
but
everyone
else
in
the
meeting
include
larry
israel
mark
meagher
and
ben
rise
up
to
say
what
s
the
matter
with
you
don
t
you
want
this
company
to
grow
don
t
you
want
to
make
any
acquisition
i
certainly
do
but
i
didn
t
want
to
buy
trouble
unfortunately
with
the
trenton
time
an
afternoon
paper
in
an
era
when
we
knew
what
be
happen
to
our
afternoon
competition
in
washington
that
s
what
we
would
be
get
nevertheless
i
relent
and
we
take
possession
of
the
trenton
time
add
another
worry
to
my
list
of
concern
indeed
we
never
learn
to
manage
the
paper
and
we
ran
it
abysmally
it
s
true
that
we
also
be
in
the
throe
of
a
bad
economy
there
be
circulation
and
advertising
linage
setback
right
from
the
start
we
hire
some
excellent
people
and
some
who
use
the
job
as
a
springboard
to
the
post
but
we
overload
the
paper
with
people
more
appropriate
for
washington
than
for
the
trenton
time
we
make
every
management
mistake
in
the
book
include
offend
and
alienate
the
local
establishment
with
a
particularly
savage
style
like
report
on
one
of
the
city
s
main
social
event
criticize
people
s
clothes
bibulous
behavior
and
so
on
we
have
a
succession
of
mostly
inappropriate
publisher
who
with
one
exception
didn
t
understand
the
community
we
edit
the
paper
well
by
our
standard
but
poorly
by
theirs
instead
of
think
about
what
be
the
right
paper
for
this
particular
community
we
seem
to
edit
the
paper
as
though
we
be
think
of
what
the
community
should
read
i
think
there
be
some
arrogance
involve
we
be
go
to
bless
them
with
a
minor
version
of
the
washington
post
some
people
derisively
refer
to
it
as
the
washington
post
north
in
the
meantime
the
trentonian
a
feisty
morning
tabloid
own
by
ralph
ingersoll
in
partnership
with
mark
goodson
be
give
blue
collar
trenton
what
it
enjoy
it
be
a
clever
paper
produce
inexpensively
and
inoffensively
with
an
emphasis
on
amusement
we
start
a
saturday
morning
newspaper
to
try
to
go
head
to
head
with
the
trentonian
which
counter
by
start
a
sunday
paper
to
compete
directly
with
ours
we
may
not
have
be
lose
money
but
we
weren
t
near
the
profit
goal
we
d
set
or
be
lead
to
believe
be
possible
this
be
our
first
newspaper
acquisition
after
the
post
but
it
be
layer
away
from
me
and
continued
to
be
mismanage
most
of
the
time
we
have
it
because
the
washington
post
company
now
have
a
much
high
profile
particularly
after
watergate
how
badly
we
be
do
in
trenton
become
a
big
deal
we
be
widely
write
up
and
our
trouble
be
highlight
at
one
time
i
make
the
foolish
statement
which
be
how
i
felt
that
it
be
our
vietnam
there
seem
to
be
no
solution
and
no
way
out
this
be
not
our
shin
moment
however
by
now
we
be
in
a
position
to
add
to
the
company
and
we
kept
look
for
compatible
property
throughout
the
communication
industry
among
the
business
that
we
approach
or
that
approach
us
be
new
york
magazine
the
new
yorker
the
atlantic
monthly
random
house
and
simon
and
schuster
but
the
first
three
didn
t
work
out
and
the
two
publishing
house
be
just
too
large
to
bite
off
or
so
we
thought
we
also
miss
on
the
newspaper
in
wilmington
delaware
and
we
decline
to
bid
on
the
denver
post
an
important
deal
that
we
do
make
be
prompt
by
our
concern
about
have
the
number
one
newspaper
and
number
one
television
station
in
washington
and
be
view
as
a
medium
monopoly
at
a
time
when
the
fcc
be
look
hard
at
situation
of
cross
ownership
the
supreme
court
be
soon
go
to
be
decide
a
case
relevant
to
this
issue
whether
a
company
that
own
a
newspaper
could
also
own
a
television
station
in
the
same
town
or
market
company
in
these
situation
be
worried
about
the
outcome
our
communication
lawyer
advise
me
to
consider
trading
wtop
for
a
similar
size
station
elsewhere
that
be
also
face
a
cross
ownership
situation
they
be
concerned
that
the
washington
post
company
have
too
much
dominance
in
washington
d
c
right
under
the
eye
of
congress
and
that
a
decision
against
cross
ownership
would
come
at
a
moment
when
we
be
in
the
midst
of
a
license
renewal
and
therefore
not
in
a
position
to
try
for
a
station
swap
at
that
time
warren
and
i
make
the
round
of
all
the
possible
comparable
station
in
los
angeles
dallas
houston
atlanta
detroit
only
peter
clark
head
of
the
detroit
news
company
which
have
both
a
newspaper
and
a
television
station
in
a
depressed
area
be
interested
in
talk
detroit
be
nearly
the
same
size
market
as
washington
at
the
time
we
be
the
eighth
large
broadcast
market
in
the
country
and
detroit
be
the
seventh
the
major
difference
be
that
our
market
be
grow
and
theirs
be
stagnant
however
in
some
way
detroit
be
a
well
television
town
than
a
newspaper
town
so
there
be
some
hope
of
end
up
in
a
profitable
situation
the
decision
of
whether
to
trade
wtop
for
wwj
in
detroit
later
rename
wdiv
be
mine
and
i
be
enough
worried
about
the
political
climate
and
the
weakness
of
our
newspaper
competition
in
washington
that
i
decide
in
favor
of
it
warren
and
i
together
initially
negotiate
with
peter
in
detroit
he
want
million
cash
plus
wtop
because
his
station
be
big
and
more
profitable
than
ours
we
say
that
be
too
much
peter
come
to
see
me
in
washington
and
i
ask
warren
to
be
there
but
he
say
i
could
and
should
do
it
on
my
own
and
we
finally
settle
for
million
the
deal
be
do
the
first
time
i
have
negotiate
by
myself
but
still
i
be
not
very
happy
we
be
give
up
our
old
station
one
with
connection
back
to
phil
and
my
father
one
which
i
knew
and
love
and
which
we
d
built
up
to
number
one
in
the
market
for
detroit
a
strange
town
unlike
any
i
have
know
when
the
actual
changeover
come
people
at
wtop
be
so
devote
to
jim
snyder
our
news
director
who
be
go
to
detroit
for
us
that
the
anchor
burst
into
tear
when
they
sign
off
for
the
last
time
under
our
ownership
the
situation
in
detroit
be
bad
than
my
bad
fear
we
have
trade
a
top
flight
station
in
a
dynamic
market
for
a
mediocre
station
in
a
market
that
be
mire
in
a
recession
on
top
of
that
the
station
be
an
nbc
affiliate
and
nbc
at
that
time
be
a
network
in
trouble
we
have
our
usual
new
in
the
market
problem
we
want
to
run
a
well
station
but
resistance
to
change
be
endemic
and
detroiters
be
use
to
have
their
news
deliver
in
a
certain
way
no
matter
how
bad
it
may
have
be
again
as
in
trenton
we
be
paint
as
the
out
of
towner
any
time
we
make
a
mistake
or
try
something
new
critic
at
the
other
station
or
at
the
newspaper
leapt
on
us
it
be
so
bad
that
jim
snyder
have
a
serious
heart
attack
and
have
to
leave
i
suffer
acutely
at
have
decide
to
make
the
trade
particularly
after
the
supreme
court
hand
down
its
decision
grandfathering
those
company
who
already
have
station
in
cross
ownership
town
little
by
little
the
detroit
station
improve
and
become
very
successful
but
that
didn
t
happen
before
i
have
spent
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
blame
myself
as
part
of
the
large
plan
to
acquire
several
small
newspaper
which
never
materialize
in
we
also
bought
the
everett
herald
a
small
paper
locate
in
a
city
north
of
seattle
washington
as
with
the
trenton
time
the
herald
be
acquire
after
poor
appraisal
we
paid
a
monopoly
price
for
a
paper
that
be
in
a
somewhat
competitive
situation
with
seattle
and
then
proceed
not
to
run
it
well
until
recently
when
it
have
be
vastly
improve
we
also
participate
with
dow
jones
in
a
start
up
newsprint
mill
at
bear
island
in
virginia
a
little
later
under
newsweek
s
aegis
and
at
its
urge
we
make
another
start
up
a
monthly
sport
magazine
call
inside
sport
this
be
spearhead
by
peter
derow
and
the
business
side
of
newsweek
again
we
conceive
it
poorly
test
it
poorly
and
ran
it
poorly
despite
a
clever
editor
john
walsh
it
too
lose
large
amount
of
money
than
we
expect
and
drain
talent
energy
and
time
from
newsweek
itself
important
change
be
take
place
at
the
star
which
in
the
short
run
create
some
worry
at
the
post
and
in
the
longer
run
cause
us
even
more
concern
before
the
end
come
when
the
star
finally
fold
joe
allbritton
have
work
hard
to
turn
around
his
staid
and
fail
newspaper
when
he
first
come
to
town
he
have
put
in
as
editor
jim
bellow
a
great
talent
who
didn
t
try
to
compete
with
us
where
we
be
strong
but
go
under
around
and
beside
us
the
paper
become
livelier
more
interest
and
scrappier
jim
start
a
gossip
column
call
the
ear
which
specialized
in
tweak
the
post
which
the
star
refer
to
as
the
o
p
or
the
other
paper
the
most
intimate
detail
of
the
life
of
many
of
us
at
the
post
become
grist
for
the
mill
of
the
ear
in
particular
it
be
savage
about
ben
bradlee
and
sally
quinn
refer
to
them
as
the
fun
couple
and
reporting
on
their
every
activity
no
doubt
with
some
help
from
reliable
source
in
our
own
city
room
we
all
come
in
for
attention
some
of
it
accurate
some
of
it
half
accurate
some
entirely
fictitious
but
despite
the
good
thing
that
be
happen
the
star
be
in
a
real
decline
which
of
course
have
start
long
before
allbritton
enter
the
picture
there
be
no
question
that
its
longtime
dominance
and
success
have
breed
self
satisfaction
and
lack
of
drive
it
never
seem
to
occur
to
the
ownership
that
the
world
could
change
even
so
the
extend
star
family
wasn
t
the
main
reason
why
we
start
to
gain
and
the
star
start
to
decline
a
societal
change
in
the
country
strengthen
morning
newspaper
while
at
the
same
time
bring
hard
time
to
the
traditionally
strong
afternoon
and
even
paper
principally
the
growth
of
television
network
news
the
flight
to
the
suburb
from
the
inner
city
and
urban
problem
affect
late
day
home
delivery
all
weaken
afternoon
daily
possibly
most
important
of
all
be
the
economy
as
price
rise
particularly
for
labor
and
newsprint
newspaper
raise
rate
force
advertiser
to
choose
between
paper
not
divide
their
advertising
as
many
have
previously
do
if
a
newspaper
rise
to
a
certain
dominance
there
be
often
a
snowball
effect
advertiser
realize
that
more
people
could
be
reach
through
the
large
newspaper
so
in
an
effort
to
cut
cost
they
eliminate
the
weaker
one
once
the
momentum
get
go
there
be
not
much
that
could
be
do
in
some
way
this
be
what
happen
to
the
star
exacerbate
by
the
lack
of
attention
to
the
competition
for
far
too
long
no
one
at
the
star
have
take
the
post
seriously
but
our
advantage
be
not
yet
overwhelm
and
i
have
learn
as
have
my
father
and
phil
before
me
what
it
feel
like
to
be
fight
for
your
life
we
knew
how
far
we
d
go
for
a
line
of
advertising
or
a
new
subscriber
don
and
i
still
bear
the
scar
young
as
he
be
don
too
understood
that
nothing
stand
still
that
success
can
bring
with
it
the
root
of
its
own
downfall
in
march
allbritton
reach
an
agreement
to
trade
or
sell
his
washington
d
c
radio
station
which
accord
to
the
star
s
monthly
publication
for
its
employee
would
provide
star
communication
with
a
guaranteed
cash
flow
over
the
next
year
indeed
only
a
month
later
allbritton
announce
the
first
profitable
quarter
at
the
star
since
several
year
before
he
take
over
i
write
congratulate
him
and
he
respond
that
he
knew
one
swallow
didn
t
make
a
spring
but
that
at
last
he
saw
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
which
he
also
realize
might
be
a
mirage
the
star
be
a
much
improve
product
and
allbritton
s
brilliant
move
in
sell
his
radio
and
small
television
station
put
him
in
a
far
strong
financial
position
i
be
worried
but
not
as
much
as
when
in
early
february
time
inc
announce
that
it
be
buying
the
star
allbritton
be
keep
the
valuable
television
station
now
we
be
face
with
the
powerful
rich
professional
savvy
time
inc
which
we
saw
as
an
even
great
threat
than
the
texas
millionaire
time
s
people
try
new
idea
invest
vast
sum
and
use
time
magazine
s
foreign
correspondent
to
run
foreign
news
in
the
star
and
they
spent
even
more
money
than
allbritton
have
on
promotion
the
theme
today
s
news
today
begin
to
appear
on
billboard
everywhere
on

message
about

to
the

of
some
enchant
even
the
christian

ran
an
article
about
the
increase
competition
between
the
post
and
the
star
head
star
war
come
to
washington
one
of
the
first
thing
the
new
editor
of
the
star
do
under
the
time
inc
regime
be
to
exhume
a
five
part
profile
of
me
by
lynn
rosellini
that
initially
have
be
suggest
by
joe
allbritton
himself
as
a
kind
of
hand
off
look
at
me
in
the
end
he
have
order
it
kill
because
he
thought
it
be
so
negative
time
inc
s
people
at
the
star
resurrect
it
promote
it
to
the
sky
and
even
run
the
first
two
part
of
the
series
on
the
front
page
i
m
not
exactly
objective
about
the
series
and
have
never
reread
it
but
my
memory
be
vivid
that
i
be
portrayed
as
a
sort
of
jekyll
hyde
not
that
some
of
what
rosellini
say
wasn
t
true
but
i
be
picture
so
negatively
that
i
fear
no
one
would
ever
work
for
us
again
i
get
a
lot
of
sympathetic
mail
and
the
star
ran
a
highly
supportive
letter
from
barry
goldwater
which
i
found
all
the
more
move
for
his
not
be
close
to
me
goldwater
write
now
i
don
t
happen
to
be
one
the
washington
post
have
be
kind
to
during
my
political
life
in
fact
i
imagine
i
have
suffer
as
much
from
its
editorial
and
reportorial
whim
as
any
person
in
politics
but
that
s
beside
the
point
there
come
a
time
in
my
opinion
when
decency
in
reporting
must
have
some
consideration
and
neither
your
reporter
nor
your
publication
show
any
inclination
toward
that
you
can
be
critical
in
a
decent
way
of
the
manner
in
which
mr
graham
conduct
her
business
but
i
don
t
believe
you
have
any
right
to
be
critical
of
the
way
she
have
conduct
her
life
nor
have
you
the
right
to
be
dishonest
about
it
with
time
inc
s
arrival
in
town
it
s
a
wonder
that
i
have
the
time
or
inclination
for
anything
else
in
my
life
but
several
activity
that
be
a
mix
of
public
and
private
provide
me
with
both
a
reprieve
from
business
concern
and
a
measure
of
fun
and
personal
satisfaction
bob
mcnamara
then
president
of
the
world
bank
have
commit
that
institution
to
try
to
help
the
nation
of
the
so
call
third
world
northern
country
be
distressed
by
the
radical
rhetoric
of
the
country
of
the
south
and
their
irrational
demand
for
billion
of
dollar
in
aid
and
the
country
of
the
south
be
angered
at
what
they
view
as
the
insensitivity
and
heartlessness
of
the
north
bob
s
idea
be
to
ask
a
group
to
look
at
these
problem
as
individual
rather
than
as
representative
of
their
country
and
he
have
tapped
willy
brandt
former
chancellor
of
west
germany
to
lead
it
the
group
come
to
be
know
as
the
brandt
commission
bob
argue
that
it
would
be
good
for
me
to
join
because
it
would
expose
me
to
an
aspect
of
the
world
about
which
i
knew
little
because
i
would
bring
a
sense
of
what
be
politically
viable
within
the
united
state
and
because
it
would
be
good
for
the
post
and
newsweek
to
become
more
aware
of
these
issue
although
i
be
reluctant
to
break
our
rule
about
not
get
involve
in
organization
that
take
stand
on
issue
i
decide
there
be
time
for
exception
to
rule
and
this
be
one
i
accepted
sixteen

the
first
of
our
meeting
take
place
in
december
of
at
gymnich
castle
near
bonn
for
me
it
be
like
plunge
into
another
world
one
where
people
spoke
peculiar
language
in
all
of
which
they
toss
around
strange
acronym
while
bantering
about
meeting
and
report
from
the
past
united
nation
subdivision
and
the
function
of
the
bank
and
the
imf
since
we
sat
alphabetically

over
the
two
year
of
our
seat
assignment
for
most
of
that
first
meeting
indeed
for
most
of
the
first
year
i
say
little
or
nothing
too
intimidate
by
the
unfamiliar
issue
and
the
expert
around
me
gradually
through
the
meal
the
walk
the
informal
gathering
over
tea
or
drink
the
atmosphere
begin
to
change
and
in
certain
area
thing
be
warm
up
a
little
faster
than
i
realize
one
of
the
most
radical
of
the
third
worlders
a
famous
lady
man
surprised
me
by
invite
me
to
his
room
i
thanked
him
for
the
compliment
but
say
i
follow
an
old
adage
never
where
you
work
he
reply
that
he
heed
another
one
never
say
never
the
atmosphere
have
certainly
grown
more
friendly
as
the
time
for
the
final
meeting
drew
near
none
of
us
could
see
how
we
be
possibly
go
to
produce
a
report
the
commission
seem
to
consist
of
prima
donna
who
rarely
agree
on
anything
but
our
chairman
be
clearly
determine
to
push
through
a
report
at
the
final
meeting
during
an
exasperate
afternoon
session
brandt
beet
red
and
breathing
heavily
blew
his
top
make
a
final
statement
and
withdrew
completely
depressed
at
our
lack
of
progress
the
remain
commissioner
decide
that
shridath
sonny
ramphal
of
guyana
from
the
south
and
ted
heath
from
the
north
should
work
with
michael
hoffman
brandt
s
aide
on
the
final
draft
we
met
one
more
time
and
lead
by
ted
work
our
way
through
comment
on
all
the
section
by
great
good
luck
ted
later
recall
brandt
be
delayed
in
arrive
in
england
and
ted
seize
the
moment
to
force
decision
and
get
the
report
accepted
what
effect
do
it
have
quite
a
lot
in
certain
european
country
very
little
if
any
in
the
united
state
we
have
arrive
at
a
negotiate
consensus
there
be
thing
in
the
report
to
which
all
of
us
take
exception
but
you
have
to
sign
it
or
not
and
we
all
do
in
the
end
the
report
turn
out
to
be
exactly
what
it
be
design
not
to
be
with
the
various
commissioner
basically
represent
their
state
or
constituency
i
spoke
to
ben
about
the
report
before
it
be
release
say
that
though
i
knew
this
kind
of
thing
didn
t
much
interest
him
i
thought
it
matter
and
hop
he
would
make
sure
it
get
the
kind
of
news
play
it
deserve
ben
s
attention
span
be
not
always
perfect
but
i
be
positively
disbelieve
when
i
locate
the
story
of
the
commission
s
report
on
page
of
the
post
even
the
new
york
time
have
put
it
on
page
i
be
so
angry
i
be
absolutely
unable
to
speak
to
ben
for
twenty
four
hour
l
i
explode
he
have
simply
forgotten
i
suppose
i
do
contribute
something
by
implore
the
editor
of
newsweek
to
focus
on
the
issue
in
fact
urge
them
to
do
a
cover
story
on
the
third
world
i
knew
it
wouldn
t
be
a
thriller
but
thought
it
be
something
we
owe
our
reader
after
considerable
footdragging
newsweek
finally
do
a
cover
story
some
time
shortly
after
the
brandt
report
be
issue
to
the
not
so
secret
satisfaction
of
the
editor
it
be
the
bad
sell
issue
of
the
year
during
this
period
while
i
be
still
publisher
of
the
paper
more
of
my
energy
be
go
to
the
washington
post
company
than
to
the
washington
post
itself
i
have
be
think
for
quite
a
while
about
turn
the
paper
over
to
don
but
be
struggle
with
several
question
when
be
the
transition
best
for
don
when
be
it
best
for
me
when
be
it
best
for
the
post
toward
the
end
of
when
i
have
be
publisher
in
title
for
nearly
ten
year
and
in
essence
for
some
year
before
that
i
decide
the
time
be
ripe
i
be
enough
detach
as
a
parent
to
know
that
don
be
ready
he
have
always
be
more
mature
than
his
year
always
hardworking
conscientious
decent
bright
and
able
and
i
need
to
concentrate
on
the
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
aspect
of
the
company
which
be
grow
more
and
more
demand
at
the
same
time
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
have
to
be
a
change
in
the
editorial
page
i
couldn
t
solve
phil
geyelin
s
problem
for
him
and
the
situation
have
grown
difficult
for
everyone
i
thought
that
phil
should
retire
and
that
meg
should
become
editor
and
i
knew
don
agree
but
for
two
reason
i
didn
t
want
to
be
the
one
to
make
the
change
first
meg
be
my
friend
and
i
worried
that
such
a
move
on
my
part
in
essence
promote
my
friend
might
be
perceive
negatively
more
important
i
have
learn
when
i
begin
to
work
and
make
my
own
first
major
move
bring
ben
to
the
post
that
there
be
a
completely
different
relationship
with
the
people
you
put
in
place
as
contrast
with
the
people
you
inherit
from
your
predecessor
i
didn
t
want
don
to
inherit
my
editor
even
if
it
be
someone
on
whom
we
agree
i
felt
strongly
that
he
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
name
his
own
editor
so
i
decide
to
act
at
the
begin
of
the
follow
year
on
january
at
a
routine
expand
staff
meeting
i
turn
over
the
title
of
publisher
of
the
post
to
don
have
make
my
announcement
i
go
on
to
answer
publicly
some
of
the
question
i
have
be
wrestling
with
privately
what
would
it
mean
and
why
now
to
the
question
of
why
now
the
answer
in
fact
be
easy
it
be
because
don
be
ready
and
i
be
ready
actually
i
suspect
don
be
ready
before
i
be
i
told
the
staff
don
with
his
usual
grace
respond
my
mother
have
give
me
everything
but
an
easy
act
to
follow
my
father
phil
my
son
and
i
all
have
in
common
a
love
of
the
newspaper
business
but
don
be
also
very
different
from
the
other
three
of
us
to
begin
with
he
be
far
more
qualify
in
experience
and
temperament
than
we
be
at
the
time
each
of
us
take
over
he
have
edit
both
the
st
albans
news
and
the
harvard
crimson
newspapering
clearly
be
where
his
interest
lay
when
he
be
in
vietnam
we
have
write
each
other
about
his
future
on
the
post
by
then
he
have
decide
to
put
off
come
to
the
paper
in
order
to
learn
more
about
the
world
he
strongly
believe
that
you
couldn
t
be
a
good
newspaperman
if
you
ve
do
nothing
but
work
for
newspaper
all
your
life
besides
phil
others
whom
he
respect
have
suggest
to
him
that
do
many
different
thing
and
have
many
different
experience
be
the
best
possible
preparation
for
any
job
don
have
particularly
learn
from
john
gardner
and
from
scotty
reston
who
told
him
that
he
thought
the
important
thing
be
that
no
one
should
be
able
to
say
to
someone
you
just
don
t
understand
my
situation
he

and
be
somewhat
irritated
with
ben
for
resolve
his
problem
at
my
expense
but
i
also
saw
it
as
a
great
mid
career
management
job
for
don
because
it
combine
his
passion
for
the
editorial
side
of
the
business
with
his
love
of
sport
i
could
hardly
frustrate
him
by
not
agree
so
i
accede
to
the
move
on
condition
that
don
go
in
and
out
in
a
year
and
that
he
replace
himself
which
he
do
brilliantly
with
george
solomon
in
his
year
at
the
helm
of
sport
don
work
harder
than
anyone
i
d
ever
see
i
once
found
him
at
his
desk
at
three
in
the
morning
and
ask
him
why
he
be
there
his
response
be
that
since
he
d
do
a
stint
in
production
he
knew
exactly
how
many
late
score
it
be
possible
to
send
down
to
the
compose
room
between
and
a
m
and
still
get
the
paper
out
on
time
when
his
year
in
sport
be
up
don
become
assistant
general
manager
and
it
be
from
that
vantage
point
that
he
be
so
helpful
to
me
and
so
instrumental
to
the
paper
during
the
pressman
s
strike
i
knew
then
that
he
be
more
than
ready
to
take
over
as
publisher
the
relationship
between
him
and
me
might
have
be
immensely
difficult
but
we
have
both
work
to
make
it
smooth
it
s
difficult
to
have
a
parent
for
your
bos
to
have
that
parent
be
your
mother
be
even
harder
don
deserves
the
major
share
of
the
credit
for
make
our
professional
relationship
a
happy
one
once
he
be
publisher
don
name
meg
to
succeed
phil

and
the
op

page
and
write
her
column
for
the
post
and
newsweek
with
great
distinction
though
i
have
always
know
don
would
one
day
become
publisher
what
i
hadn
t
foreseen
be
that
it
would
be
so
hard
for
me
to
give
it
up
but
the
move
be
an
enormous
emotional
wrench
which
i
have
to
steel
myself
to
endure
because
i
knew
it
be
right
publisher
of
the
post
be
a
title
i
would
miss
i
love
be
directly
involve
with
the
paper
and
be
intensely
emotionally
attach
to
it
the
early
year
of
participation
with
my
father
and
phil
in
the
struggle
to
survive
and
my
own
dramatic
year
as
publisher
have
left
me
with
an
immeasurable
and
immutable
love
for
the
post
but
i
wasn
t
go
to
hang
on
too
long
just
because
i
enjoy
it
all
so
much
so
i
have
withdrawal
pang
but
i
left
with
a
more
than
full
time
and
challenge
job
as
head
of
the
company
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
responsible
for
the

soundness
and
economic
health
of

and
about
two
thousand
shareholder
by
the
fall
of
the
company

do
pretty
well
from
a
financial
point
of
view
there
have
be
a
slight
run
up
in
the
stock
but
as
always
there
be
problem
include
the
ongoing
difficulty
at
the
trenton
time
and
inside
sport
and
an
earnings
decline
i
be
feel
less
than
confident
about
my
ability
to
turn
any
of
this
around
warren
and
i
be
drive
down
to
glen
welby
for
the
weekend
when
as
tactfully
and
gently
as
he
could
he
broke
the
news
to
me
that
bill
ruane
and
sandy
gottesman
close
friend
of
his
and
investor
who
have
bought
a
lot
of
post
stock
for
themselves
and
for
their
client
be
go
to
sell
ten
of
million
of

worth
of
it

and
gottesman
be
a
manage
partner
at
the
first
manhattan
company
and
these
group
be
about
to
sell
all
or
half
of
their
post
stock
warren
have
ponder
how
best
to
deliver
this
news
and
he
try
sugar
coat
it
in
every
way
he
could
i
have
to
admit
that
my
immediate
response
be
to
burst
into
tear
here
be
these
terribly
clever
investor
repute
to
have
such
great
judgment
who
no
longer
believe
in
us
others
surely
would
be
leave
in
drove
i
consider
their
move
a
referendum
on
my
management
of
the
company
and
it
be
clear
i
be
found
want
warren
do
his
desperate
best
to
console
me
explain
that
bill
consider
he
have
do
so
well
on
post
stock
that
it
add
up
to
too
much
of
some
of
his
portfolio
he
be
keep
his
own
stock
you
don
t
know
wall
street
warren
try
to
reassure
me
people
don
t
think
in
a
long
term
way
there
when
your
stock
reach
wall
street
will
buy
it
naturally
i
thought
he
be
just
try
to
make
me
feel
well
it
be
absurd
to
think
that
the
stock
would
ever
reach
i
be
not
console
warren
of
course
have
a
totally
different
perspective
from
mine
on
what
bill
and
sandy
be
do
he
view
it
as
an
enormous
plus
in
the
lifetime
of
the
company
almost
like
the
time
herald
merger
though
he
knew
i
d
be
profoundly
distressed
by
the
idea
he
realize
right
away
how
much
the
company
would
benefit
in
future
profit
by
their
sell
their
stock
he
try
to
convince
me
that
we
should
be
hold
a
party
add
don
t
worry
we
ll
just
buy
what
they
sell
it
will
be
good
for
us
and
they
ll
regret
it
although
i
didn
t
stop
worry
we
do
buy
in
the
stock
at
an
average
price
of
which
sandy
and
bill
have
bought
before
two
split
at
an
equivalent
price
of
once
much
later
warren
and
i
discuss
woman
bursting
into
tear
in
business
situation
and
i
remind
him
of
our
ride
to
glen
welby
well
he
say
smile
we
make
several
hundred
million
dollar
then
the
next
time
you
burst
into
tear
call
me
first
he
add
look
at
it
this
way
kay
if
you
hadn
t
bought
it
in
i
would
have
burst
into
tear
so
one
of
us
have
to
cry
from
this
point
on
i
really
concentrate
on
try
to
get
the
company
straighten
out
i
resign
from
most
of
the
outside
board
on
which
i
have
be
serve
the
university
of
chicago
and
george
washington
university
among
them
as
well
as
allied
chemical
and
become
much
more
actively
involve
with
group
associate
with
the
medium
and
with
newspaper
the
bureau
of
advertising
the
board
of
the
associate
press
and
most
important
the
board
of
the
american
newspaper
publisher
association
give
all
the
company
s
problem
with
which
i
be
deal
at
the
time
it
may
have
be
crazy
to
have
be
involve
so
actively
with
all
three
of
these
industry
organization
but
since
none
of
them
have
any
other
woman
it
serve
a
purpose
for
them
and
be
helpful
with
the
industry
as
well
as
help
me
become
more
familiar
with
some
of
the
large
problem
that
medium
company
face
the
bureau
of
advertising
on
which
i
serve
from
through
bumping
up
to
its
executive
board
from
to
have
not
be
a
favorite
of
phil
s
but
i
found
it
a
congenial
place
its
board
have
a
decidedly
lopsided
composition
at
the
time
not
only
be
it
all
male
and
all
white
but
it
be
business
not
editorial
orient
the
eighteen
director
on
the
ap
board
be
elect
by
the
membership
and
anyone
wish
to
serve
have
to
campaign
for
election
which
i
found
difficult
although
i
d
be
warn
that
most
people
didn
t
get
elect
on
their
first
try
i
be
still
disappointed
when
i
be
defeat
on
mine
the
follow
year
in
april
i
be
well
organize
and
won
become
the
first
woman
member
of
the

on
which
i
serve
the
allot
three
term
until
i
have
be
elect
to
anpa
s
board
in
again
the
first

but
this
time
not
until
a
man
who
actively
oppose

member
have
himself
left
the
board
i
write
lori
wilson
al
neuharth
s
wife
the
view
of
the
good
ole
boy
will
not
die
except
generationally
their
view
of
the
lovely
lady
and
toast
to
the
wife
will
be
with
us
for
the
rest
of
our
anpa
life
in
those
year
the
chairmanship
of
the
board
alternate
each
two
year
term
between
men
associate
with
big
and
small
paper
and
under
a
very
undemocratic
procedure
the
incumbent
chairman
essentially
chose
or
designate
his
successor
in
al
neuharth
who
be
the
group
s
chairman
at
the
time
approach
me
with
the
idea
that
i
become
chairman
after
the
tenure
of
a
nice
able
man
len
small
who
ran
a
group
of
illinois
paper
and
be
slat
to
succeed
al
the
idea
have
never
enter
my
head
but
al
be
firm
in
his
conviction
that
i
should
be
willing
to
take
on
the
job
point
out
that
if
i
didn
t
there
be
no
other
woman
in
the
foreseeable
future
who
would
be
there
to
do
it
little
by
little
i
come
to
agree
that
i
should
be
available
another
barrier
to
crack
and
that
it
might
be
interest
as
well
i
say
if
he
could
pull
it
off
i
d
like
it
so
len
invite
me
to
succeed
him
when
his
term
be
up
in
and
make
it
know
that
this
be
to
happen
but
another
tragedy
hurl
me
into
yet
another
job
with
little
or
no
preparation
len
be
kill
in
an
automobile
accident
and
with
almost
no
warm
up

two

and
big
paper

very
different
point
of
view
and
interest
be
one
more
stressful
obligation
it
be
inconceivably
intimidate
for
me
at
first
to
preside
over
the
two
day
committee
meeting
and
the
convention
and

with
the

at
the

in
reston
virginia
in
addition
i
have
to
wrestle
with
the
dawn
problem
of

the
challenge
of
the
phone
company
around
the

at

try
to
concentrate
on
strategic
planning
for
the
company
and
hop
to
make
progress
in
the
division
and
to
improve
the
way
in
which
each
related
to
the
others
we
still
need
a
sounder
growth
policy
in
corporate
i
have
be
think
and
work
and
pick
the
brain
of
various
people
for
year
about
growth
issue
but
have
see
little
or
no
progress
i
be
also
think
about
the
importance
of
performance
appraisal
and
reward
financial
and
otherwise
as
always
there
be
people
problem
in
the
early
summer
of
i
go
through
another
painful
turnover
at
newsweek
ed
kosner

be
a
very
successful
number
two
under
oz
elliott
but
without
oz
he
be
have
difficulty
manage
the
large
staff
ed
be
a
journalist
of
rare
gift
but
not
yet
a
manager
morale
be
at
a
low
point
one
person
described
to
me
what
be
happen
as
be
like
the
magazine
have
a
nervous
breakdown
peter
derow
and
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
discuss
what
to
do
and
again
i
m
afraid
i
listen
to
him
and
take
his
advice
against
my
instinct
for
one
thing
i
told
peter
that
if
ed
be
in
so
much
trouble
we
have
to
warn
him
peter
s
answer
be
absolutely
not
if
you
do
that
he
s
so
unpredictable
he
might
walk
right
out
the
door
stupidly
i
give
in
to
peter
s
fear
and
didn
t
have
the
blunt
talk
with
ed
that
anyone
under
danger
of
dismissal
have
every
right
to
expect
and
that
can
often
be
effective
in
the
meantime
i
d
be
approach
by
an
editor
whom
i
knew
at
firsthand
to
be
highly
skilled
in
newspaper
and
whose
skill
i
thought
would
be
transferrable
to
a
newsweekly
this
be
someone
i
have
work
with
and
trust
who
want
the
job
and
who
i
thought
would
be
perfect
but
when
i
discuss
it
with
peter
he
discourage
me
from
take
a
risk
by
bring
in
a
non
news
weekly
editor
again
i
accede
to
what
i
believe
be
his
well
judgment
so
we
go
back
to
lester
bernstein
once
newsweek
s
national
and
manage
editor
who
we
thought
would
make
a
safe
transition
for
a
few
year
until
we
found
another
editor
i
knew
instantly
that
this
be
a
wrong
move
when
the
first
thing
lester
do
be
take
a
month
s
vacation
when
peter
and
i
broke
the
news
to
ed
he
be
naturally
upset
and
bitter
and
he
have
a
valid
cause
for
complaint
since
neither
of
us
have
ever
fully
air
our
difference
with
him
there
be
a
meeting
to
let
the
editorial
staff
know
about
the
change
ed
walk
in
say
i
be
leave
the
magazine
and
then
walk
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
building
i
stood
up
directly
afterwards
say
i
be
sorry
for
the
abruptness
of
it
and
praise
ed
and
lester
then
i
too
left
i
want
nothing
more
than
to
escape
and
there
be
such
a
large
crowd
wait
for
an
elevator
that
i
walk
down
the
stair
from
the
fortieth
floor
to
the
twelfth
where
the
corporate
office
be
it
be
another
change
of
editor
at
the
top
and
yet
another
chance
for
people
to
skewer
me
for
be
a
difficult
woman
i
have
notice
that
when
an
editor
get
change
it
be
often
the
people
under
him
who
have
complain
the
most
vocally
who
then
criticize
me
the
loud
for
the
way
it
be
do
so
sudden
so
unexpected
so
cruel
privately
however
people
told
me
it
be
a
move
that
have
to
be
make
at
the
time
to
help
newsweek
we
go
through
two
more
unsuccessful
try
at
the
editorship
before
we
finally
come
up
with
rick
smith
there
be
more
change
to
come
my
relationship
with
mark
meagher
be
not
an
easy
one
and
be
grow
more
and
more
try
as
i
realize
that
here
be
yet
another
executive
who
have
not
work
out
as
i
have
hop
mark
be
a
good
person
with
great
ability
in
certain
area
but
he
be
probably
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
have
be
rush
to
the
top
of
the
company
as
president
and
chief
operating
officer
in
july
we
announce
that
mark
would
resign
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
decision
have
be
all
the
more
difficult
because
i
be
fond
of
him
personally
this
may
have
be
the
low
point
of
my
business
life
it
be
certainly
one
of
the
most
painful
and
discourage
time
i
d
have
mark
s
departure
get
writ
large
in
my
mind
not
just
as
my
personal
fail
but
rather
as
a
sign
that
the
whole
company
be
in
turmoil
corporate
be
certainly
not
well
run
we
hadn
t
grown
in
any
sensible
or
substantive
way
and
newsweek
be
in
managerial
confusion
this
time
the
press
really
beat
up
on
me
even
exaggerate
the
number
of
change
among
the
top
executive
in
part
because
of
a
misread
of
our
organization
chart
and
a
mix
up
of
the
company
with
the
paper
there
be
no
one
within
the
company
to
whom
i
could
turn
as
a
new
president
i
be
go
to
have
to
look
outside
unfortunately
i
be
so
shaken
and
discourage
by
the
personnel
mistake
we
d
make
that
i
fear
we
wouldn
t
search
for
a
replacement
in
the
right
way
my
reputation
as
a
difficult
person
to
work
with
make
a
search
hard
under
the
best
of
circumstance
and
story
be
circulate
that
no
one
but
don
could
become
president
because
who
would
want
to
be
sandwich
between
a
mother
and
a
son
but
don
be
still
very
young
and
have
just
take
over
the
post
as
publisher
the
year
before
just
as
i
begin
to
look
for
help
peter
derow
who
by
now
have
become
a
director
of
the
company
and
chairman
of
newsweek
as
well
as
president
after
bob
campbell
s
retirement
suggest
that
we
bring
in
a
consult
firm
to
study
the
company
and
be
an
administrative
help
while
i
be
try
to
run
it
alone
i
thought
there
be
merit
to
the
idea
so
we
hire
mckinsey
and
company
and
for
the
next
year
there
be
repeat
meeting
between
people
from
mckinsey
and
from
our
company
go
endlessly
over
what
we
d
do
and
what
we
hop
to
do
i
be
increasingly
baffle
about
the
whole
consultation
process
which
seem
to
be
little
more
than
mckinsey
s
regurgitate
what
we
have
told
them
in
a
slightly
different
but
not
very
helpful
way
the
most
imprudent
suggestion
make
by
mckinsey
in
its
report
be
that
we
should
stop
buying
in
the
stock
it
have
be
all
right
to
do
at
and
but
now
that
the
stock
have
reach
it
be
no
longer
a
good
idea
i
actually
take
this
advice
for
a
while
although
as
warren
have
repeatedly
say
anyone
would
have
told
me
the
company
be
probably
worth
more
than
million
on
the
market
and
that
the
stock
market
value
be
about
a
quarter
of
that
amount
perhaps
no
one
at
mckinsey
ever
stop
to
do
that
math
afterwards
don
refer
to
the
page
in
mckinsey
s
report
on
which
the
suggestion
have
be
make
as
the
half
billion
dollar
page
give
that
that
s
what
it
probably
cost
us
in
lose
value
to
the
company
at
the
same
time
i
work
with
a
headhunter
in
my
quest
for
a
new
company
president
there
be
numerous
meeting
with
the
headhunter
and
with
various
candidate
none
of
whom
seem
very
plausible
and
many
of
whom
seem
remote
from
what
i
have
in
mind
they
be
either
condescend
to
me
or
obsequious
and
neither
alternative
appeal
to
me
in
any
way
this
activity
go
on
for
nearly
a
year
with
me
essentially
run
the
company
alone
with
help
from
marty
cohen
our
financial
vice
president
and
treasurer
and
a
management
group
that
include
the
division
head
and
the
few
other
corporate
officer
it
be
a
rough
year
and
i
have
no
reason
to
think
it
be
go
to
get
any
well
until
i
resolve
the
management
problem
in
november
an
additional
worry
come
when
mobil
oil
company
president
william
tavoulareas
sue
the
post
for
libel
for
a
story
we
d
run
a
year
earlier
by
reporter
patrick
tyler
detail
some
of
his
business
dealing
this
lawsuit
drag
on
in
various
court
one
jury
award
the
plaintiff
compensatory
and
punitive
damage
of
million
in
a
decision
overturn
by
a
judge
then
reinstate
finally
the
u
s
court
of
appeal
rule
on
march
that
the
story
be
substantially
true
and
be
not
libelous
and
after
more
than
seven
year
the
case
come
to
a
close
with
a
decision
in
our
favor
by
the
time
of
the
lawsuit
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
pressure
and
anxiety
and
activity
on
so
many
level
at
once
take
its
toll
on
a
visit
to
new
york
in
march
of
to
make
a
speech
to
an
advertising
group
i
contract
pneumonia
spent
twelve
day
in
the
hospital
there
and
return
home
extremely
weak
immediately
on
my
return
i
get
a
call
from
jim
shepley
president
of
time
inc
and
chairman
of
the
star
ask
to
meet
me
this
signal
yet
another
dramatic
moment
in
our
life
mine
and
don
s
at
least
jim
s
call
meant
that
time
inc
be
ready
to
do
something
about
the
star
and
want
to
talk
about
the
possibility
of
a
joint
operating
agreement
our
family
have
always
want
and
welcome
the
competition
and
felt
that
everyone
be
well
off
with
it
than
without
it
so
don
and
i
and
warren
have
many
meeting
with
our
lawyer
and
the
star
s
representative
try
to
arrive
at
an
agreement
we
be
still
negotiate
when
ten
day
after
our
last
meeting
official
from
time
inc
held
a
press
conference
to
announce
the
closing
of
the
star
in
two
week
i
actually
heard
the
news
on
the
radio
while
i
be
in
my
car
on
my
way
to
work
the
announcement
left
me
with
a
range
of
emotion
first
and
foremost
i
be
deeply
sad
that
it
have
come
to
this
that
washington
be
to
lose
a
fine
paper
that
have
many
loyal
reader
not
to
mention
employee
who
would
be
devastate
i
be
also
numbed
by
the
reality
of
this
final
victory
of
sort
bittersweet
though
it
be
after
all
the
year
of
struggle
this
be
not
a
competitor
we
hat
but
one
we
respect
there
be
some
talk
of
possible
buyer
for
the
star
but
that
seem
unlikely
rupert
murdoch
walter
annenberg
mortimer
zuckerman
and
armand
hammer
be
all
mention
as
consider
make
proposal
to
prevent
anyone
from
merely
buying
the
paper
in
order
to
profit
from
sell
its
asset
time
put
some
fairly
rigorous
requirement
on
any
buyer
we
at
the
post
continued
to
talk
to
people
at
the
star
and
to
others
al
neuharth
and
armand
hammer
among
them
about
possible
alternative
joint
operating
agreement
but
in
the
end
there
seem
no
way
to
save
the
star
on
august
the
year
old
star
cease
publication
there
be
no
gloat
as
don
say
this
be
a
sad
day
for
washington
and
the
newspaper
business
the
city
and
the
country
have
lose
a
great
american
newspaper
a
post
editorial
a
few
day
later
state
nobody
want
the
star
to
go
out
but
it
be
go
sadness
nostalgia
anger
sentimentality
and
apprehension
have
all
be
stir
by
its
loss
and
these
feeling
have
be
share
by
the
people
at
the
post
i
knew
the
star
s
fold
would
present
problem
as
well
as
opportunity
for
us
include
resentment
of
our
dominance
and
of
the
loss
of
the
other
much
beloved
voice
there
be
predictable
bitterness
unless
one
understands
newspaper
economics
and
the
inevitability
of
what
happens
when
some
degree
of
dominance
be
achieve
the
tendency
be
to
blame
the
remain
paper
for
be
ruthless
almost
a
month
later
when
it
be
clear
that
no
one
would
come
forward
to
revive
the
fall
star
we
bought
its
land
building
and
press
we
hire
a
number
of
its
writer
most
notably
mary
mcgrory
we
picked
up
enough
of
its
circulation
so
that
even
with
our
new
springfield
plant
we
desperately
need
the
building
and
press
and
we
re
still
printing
there
not
a
year
pass
before
the
opening
of
the
washington
time
newspaper
found
and
fund
by
the
unification
church
its
circulation
and
advertising
be
weak
but
the
paper
do
provide
a
lively
conservative
editorial
voice
at
vast
expense
to
the
church
presumably
its
backer
feel
that
their
presence
in
the
nation
s
capital
and
access
to
the
government
be
worth
the
price

the
begin
of
the
end
of
the
star
be
not
the
only
dramatic
occurrence
that
spring
of
the
previous
fall
an
article
by
one
of
our
new

the

so
good

so
well

that
we

for
a

that
there

inconsistency

blame
the

put
too
much
pressure
on

holy
shit
story
instead
of
solid

of
create
competition
among

to
get
on

faculty
at

university
file
a
complaint
against
the
post
relate
to
the
cooke
affair
the
new
republic
title
one
of
its
article
on
the
matter
deep
throat
s
child
i
felt
for
don
graham
who
be
then
the
publisher
and
who
take
on
a
very
tough
news
conference
and
handle
it
well
i
stuck
out
our
collective
neck
even
farther
by
call
tom
winship
then
chairman
of
the
american
society
of
newspaper
editor
a
group
that
be
meeting
in
washington
shortly
after
the
prize
be
return
to
ask
him
if
he
be
planning
a
session
on
the
affair
he
say
he
wasn
t
and
that
at
this
late
date
there
be
no
place
for
it
my
response
be
you
ll
be
the
laughingstock
of
the
industry
if
you
don
t
do
the
program
i
personally
dread
it
but
it
s
the
big
ethical
issue
of
the
moment
you
d
well
find
the
time
tom
agree
and
schedule
an
early
bird
meeting
heavily
attend
in
which
our
editor
get
pummel
i
be
proud
that
don
graham
stood
there
by
ben
often
with
his
arm
around
ben
s
shoulder
also
right
there
be
our
incomparable
former
editor
rus
wiggins
who
with
his
usual
wry
humor
say
i
feel
great
about
the
state
of
the
american
press
every
editor
i
saw
assure
me
this
couldn
t
have
happen
at
his
paper
we
take
a
terrible
drub
from
all
side
and
rightly
so
in
some
way
clearly
we
have
make
mistake
and
some
of
our
procedure
be
not
function
properly
but
i
felt
that
the
self
righteousness
on
the
part
of
many
in
the
industry
assume
it
couldn
t
have
happen
in
other
place
be
not
only
spiteful
but
shortsighted
i
later
told
an
anpa
gathering
that
there
be
a
real
danger
that
in
our
effort
not
to
have
such
a
thing
happen
again
we
will
become
so
nervous
we
will
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
not
do
the
job
that
a
free
press
be
suppose
to
do
to
add
to
my
anxiety
during
this
difficult
period
peter
derow
told
me
he
d
found
another
job
ironically
back
at
cbs
he
be
quite
willing
to
start
in
again
on
what
be
wrong
with
me
and
the
company
but
by
this
time
i
d
grown
tougher
and
told
him
that
once
be
enough
it
seem
to
irritate
him
not
to
be
able
to
do
a
repeat
monologue
on
my
failing
only
as
the
search
for
a
new
company
president
grow
a
little
more
organize
do
i
become
more
optimistic
about
the
future
i
held
interview
after
interview
with
various
candidate
at
first
not
quite
know
what
it
be
i
be
look
for
but
somehow
feel
i
d
know
it
when
i
saw
it
the
search
go
on
for
so
long
that
i
begin
refer
to
it
as
the
search
for
mr
wonderful
but
over
the
course
of
the
process
i
come
to
realize
that
i
do
have
an
idea
of
the
goal
of
the
company
and
the
search
process
help
me
crystallize
that
idea
while
at
the
same
time
help
me
define
the
quality
i
be
look
for
in
a
president
at
last
in
early
july
when
i
interviewed
dick
simmons
who
have
be
president
of
dun
bradstreet
i
instantly
saw
in
him
a
number
of
the
quality
i
knew
i
need
and
want
include
a
proven
track
record
as
a
manager
a
few
day
later
warren
don
and
mary
graham
and
i
have
dinner
with
dick
at
my
house
he
and
i
then
met
together
for
several
hour
on
a
saturday
talk
comfortably
two
week
later
i
extend
an
offer
to
dick
to
become
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
the
washington
post
company
the
search
for
mr
wonderful
which
have
take
more
than
a
year
have
end
chapter
twenty
eight
dick
simmons
s
arrival
help
make
the
decade
of
the
s
the
best
year
from
a
business
point
of
view
both
for
the
company
and
for
me
the
washington
post
company
begin
achieve
its
goal
of
sustain
earnings
growth
develop
new
business
and
building
for
the
future
and
a
great
weight
be
lift
from
my
shoulder
i
no
longer
dread
the
meeting
to
discus
plan
option
acquisition
without
the
tension
that
have
exist
for
so
long
between
me
and
whoever
occupy
that
office
across
the
conference
room
from
mine
the
future
seem
more
certain
and
more
positive
i
realize
only
in
retrospect
how
tough
the
previous
year
have
be
work
become
a
pleasure
again
without
recognize
it
i
have
gotten
to
the
point
where
the
well
thing
be
go
under
my
management
the
more
unhappy
i
become
that
the
result
weren
t
even
well
many
of
dick
s
first
move
help
make
those
result
well
yet
and
equally
important
he
help
me
gain
some
perspective
on
how
the
company
be
do
what
we
should
be
do
and
what
we
could
expect
to
do
in
some
way
dick
and
i
be
an
unusual
duo
we
be
very
different
from
each
other
in
style
and
temperament
yet
be
remarkably
compatible
in
time
we
almost
share
the
company
s
top
two
job
he
be
much
more
than
a
chief
operating
officer
he
be
my
partner
and
friend
his
true
and
sure
sense
of
himself
help
keep
him
untroubled
by
my
peculiar
managerial
background
and
my
tendency
to
call
warren
about
any
problem
or
opportunity
i
try
always
to
give
dick
the
credit
he
deserve
as
well
as
to
give
him
a
free
rein
in
all
operating
aspect
of
the
company
he
in
turn
seem
very
unbothered
by
my
high
profile
dick
move
fast
and
with
assurance
in
late
october
just
a
few
week
into
his
tenure
we
announce
that
we
be
sell
the
trenton
time
to
allbritton
communication
and
a
few
day
later
we
announce
that
we
be
engage
in
discussion
relate
to
the
sale
of
inside
sport
which
have
lose
a
lot
of
money
and
show
few
sign
of
turnaround
or
possible
improvement
i
knew
it
have
to
be
sell
and
be
relieve
when
dick
move
quickly
to
do
it
the
sale
of
these
two
property
significantly
reduce
the
company
s
earnings
for
that
year
but
allow
us
to
focus
our
effort
on
the
development
of
our
core
business
which
be
all
set
new
record
for
revenue
dick
also
take
the
lead
in
look
for
growth
opportunity
in
line
with
the
main
mission
of
our
company
related
to
the
way
people
communicate
in
we
take
our
first
step
into
the
electronic
age
by
get
into
the
cellular
telephone
business
a
few
year
later
after
building
some
of
the
first
cellular
system
in
the
united
state
we
divest
ourselves
of
what
we
have
acquire
in
this
area
it
be
a
strategic
exit
base
on
our
own
recognition
that
those
company
with
market
dominance
have
a
significant
advantage
over
the
small
player
of
whom
we
be
certainly
one
nevertheless
we
do
very
well
financially
alan
spoon
who
later
become
president
of
the
company
deserves
much
of
the
credit
here
in
we
acquire
a
small
electronic
information
company
call
legi
slate
a
database
publisher
that
be
now
the
nation
s
lead
provider
of
online
information
on
federal
legislative
and
regulatory
activity
we
also
get
into
cable
program
specifically
related
to
sport
by
acquire
about
percent
of
sportschannel
associate
a
network
that
telecast
lead
professional
sport
event
to
new
york
area
cable
subscriber
these
business
too
be
later
sell
in
november
we
successfully
launch
a
national
weekly
edition
of
the
washington
post
an
idea
i
have
heard
discuss
since
almost
the
first
year
of
my
father
s
ownership
of
the
paper
this
edition
now
have
a
circulation
of
well
over
because
the
post
be
a
local
paper
gear
to
the
washington
metropolitan
area
market
it
be
never
feasible
for
us
to
undertake
a
truly
national
daily
edition
but
this
weekly
tabloid
of
select
post
article
on
politics
and
government
satisfies
many
people
s
desire
to
follow
the
post
s
political
reporting
late
in
we
acquire
a
tutor
and
test
preparation
company
the
stanley
h
kaplan
company
now
call
the
kaplan
educational
center
which
interested
dick
more
than
it
do
me
i
confess
that
my
lack
of
interest
be
reflect
in
my
say
to
dick
i
don
t
give
a
shit
about
it
but
if
you
think
it
will
be
profitable
let
s
do
it
not
only
have
it
work
out
well
for
us
despite
some
ups
and
down
but
it
have
considerably
more
purpose
and
potential
than
i
realize
in
we
purchase
percent
of
the
common
stock
of
cowles
medium
company
owner
of
the
minneapolis
star
tribune
and
some
other
small
property
that
interest
have
grown
over
the
year
and
we
now
hold
percent
we
be
less
successful
in
several
other
area
early
in
we
try
to
buy
the
de
moines
register
a
paper
and
a
company
i
respect
greatly
and
would
have
love
to
acquire
but
we
weren
t
the
high
bidder
just
after
we
launch
the
weekly
we
bought
a
percent
interest
in
the
national
journal
a
magazine
about
the
federal
government
but
after
be
involve
for
three
year
we
let
time
mirror
acquire
it
we
look
hard
at
the
number
two
paper
both
in
chicago
the
sun
time
and
in
houston
the
post
but
didn
t
go
any
far
as
a
company
we
have
be
conservative
in
our
growth
perhaps
too
conservative
but
as
the
eighty
end
we
be
not
left
with
a
load
of
debt
and
the
result
need
to
sell
the
good
property
as
be
many
other
company
who
let
their
desire
for
growth
overwhelm
their
judgment
we
turn
down
the
denver
post
which
be
bought
by
the
time
mirror
company
with
disastrous
result
sometimes
the
thing
you
don
t
do
be
as
important
as
the
thing
you
do
my
major
frustration
in
the
first
few
year
after
dick
s
arrival
be
that
we
be
still
not
regard
by
the
financial
world
as
a
hot
property
which
kept
our
stock
undervalue
this
however
work
to
our
advantage
since
we
continued
our
consistent
pattern
of
buying
in
the
stock
which
help
us
later
of
all
our
attempt
to
grow
our
most
spectacular
success
and
the
best
acquisition
that
dick
and
i
make
together
be
cable
which
begin
with
our
purchase
of
fifty
three
cable
system
from
capital
city
communication
company
a
purchase
finalize
in
january
throughout
warren
have
help
his
friend
tom
murphy
ceo
of
cap
city
acquire
the
abc
network
i
be
happy
for
both
of
them
when
the
deal
go
through
at
least
until
i
realize
the
implication
for
me
vi
vi
warren
who
point
out
the
obvious
that
he
would
be
go
on
the
board
of
cap
city
abc
and
would
therefore
have
to
get
off
ours
by
then
warren
have
be
a
board
member
for
eleven
year
and
never
miss
a
meeting
tell
me
this
be
hard
for
him
he
knew
i
would
feel
bereft
to
say
the
least
but
he
assure
me
he
would
still
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
telephone
that
we
would
see
each
other
as
much
as
usual
that
he
would
not
vanish
from
my
life
even
so
i
be
disturbed
and
sadden
by
the
news
in
fact
it
work
out
well
warren
kept
his
share
in
our
company
and
remain
involve
with
us
more
important
as
a
sort
of
consolation
prize
murphy
allow
us
to
bid
on
cap
city
cable
system
whereas
that
company
divest
everything
else
through
investment
banker
warren
kept
a
correct
distance
from
the
negotiation
which
be
carry
on
between
the
post
company
and
cap
city
exclusively
we
ran
number
deliberate
discuss
at
length
argue
among
ourselves
and
finally
complete
the
acquisition
for
million
much
the
big
acquisition
in
the
company
s
history
and
the
one
that
propel
us
forward
to
our
high
rank
in
the
fortune
that
of
in
both
and
by
add
new
customer
and
purchasing
other
small
system
post
newsweek
cable
have
now
grown
from
to
subscriber
and
happily
warren
be
now
back
on
our
board
after
serve
cap
city
abc
for
ten
year
when
it
be
sell
to
disney
at
newsweek
after
year
of
tough
go
we
have
begin
to
turn
thing
around
one
of
the
most
painful
failure
on
my
part
be
that
both
the
business
and
the
editorial
side
of
the
magazine
kept
undergo
managerial
turmoil
each
for
different
reason
with
editorial
i
be
directly
responsible
for
the
problem
and
it
take
a
long
time
to
get
it
right
i
still
sense
great
pool
of
ill
will
and
even
disloyalty
at
newsweek
part
of
this
may
have
be
due
to
the
excessive
management
turnover
but
some
of
it
certainly
be
the
result
of
the
natural
competition
between
those
work
for
the
company
in
washington
and
those
work
in
new
york
i
finally
offer
rick
smith
the
editorship
and
knew
he
d
be
just
right
for
the
job
when
he
respond
with
don
t
worry
i
won
t
fuck
it
up
indeed
he
didn
t
under
his
strong
leadership
first
as
editor
and
later
as
president
the
whole
mood
improve
yet
another
example
for
me
of
how
thing
get
well
when
management
act
together
even
with
the
problem
newsmagazines
have
experienced
in
the
new
environment
newsweek
have
have
many
fine
success
and
a
great
deal
of
solid
growth
in
the
mid
s
newsweek
come
to
be
consider
the
best
of
the
newsmagazines
with
its
stellar
writer
like
jon
alter
bob
samuelson
jane
bryant
quinn
allan
sloan
george
will
meg
and
many
more
i
felt
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
post
newsweek
station
begin
to
do
well
and
well
as
well
our
station
cover
all
three
major
network
so
that
as
warren
once
point
out
anything
achieve
be
independent
of
whether
any
one
network
happens
to
be
hot
at
the
moment
joel
chaseman
prove
that
he
could
operate
the
television
station
so
well
under
dick
s
direction
that
their
margin
grow
competitive
with
the
best
in
the
business
our
television
news
be
as
distinguish
as
that
of
the
post
and
newsweek
all
of
the
station
include
the
two
we
have
since
acquire
in
texas
kprc
in
houston
and
ksat
in
san
antonio
now
ably
lead
by
bill
ryan
be
and
continue
to
be
leader
in
news
follow
the
demise
of
the
star
the
post
s
penetration
of
its
market
be
around
percent
daily
and
percent
sunday
through
most
of
the
s
by
far
the
high
of
any
major
u
s
metropolitan
daily
out
of
everything
we
accomplish
during
the
eighty
i
be
proudest
of
our
improve
management
of
the
company
an
area
in
which
dick
be
particularly
strong
i
once
say
i
would
like
to
win
a
pulitzer
prize
for
management
and
finally
i
be
able
to
believe
that
we
be
become
a
truly
well
run
company
what
s
more
the
effect
of
well
management
begin
to
show
our
core
business
improve
immeasurably
in
profitability
so
that
after
a
few
year
the
company
really
take
off
for
several
year
the
washington
post
company
lead
all
company
in
our
field
in
a
number
of
way
probably
more
important
to
me
than
any
public
acknowledgment
of
our
gain
however
be
what
warren
thought
about
how
we
be
do
in
mid
he
sent
don
dick
and
me
a
memo
say
that
he
have
just
go
through
a
recent
survey
of
publishing
company
that
chart
their
performance
in
various
area
he
point
out
that
when
berkshire
hathaway
bought
its
first
share
in
the
washington
post
company
in
the
spring
of
the
cost
be
million
and
the
market
value
in
for
those
share
be
million
he
have
go
down
the
list
of
publishing
company
in
the
survey
and
run
the
number
to
calculate
what
would
have
happen
if
he
have
spent
this
same
million
at
the
same
moment
in
the
share
of
the
other
company
list
in
any
other
company
he
would
have
fall
far
short
of
what
he
have
earn
with
post
company
stock
so
he
conclude
instead
of
thanks
a
million
make
it
thanks
anywhere
from
to
million
it
get
even
well
later
after
all
the
year
of
struggle
thing
have
finally
start
to
go
smoothly
for
the
company
and
for
me
though
i
never
stop
worry
altogether
it
s
not
in
my
nature
the
business
of
the
company
be
go
well
enough
and
i
have
enough
confidence
in
dick
that
i
begin
to
relax
a
little
and
to
enjoy
a
large
life
again
as
the
editorial
corporate
head
of
the
company
i
have
always
felt
strongly
that
part
of
my
job
be
to
follow
important
world
issue
that
could
affect
the
company
and
its
holding
but
i
hadn
t
always
be
in
a
position
to
give
this
responsibility
the
time
and
attention
i
felt
it
deserve
start
in
the
late
s
i
have
take
some
trip
with
a
few
editor
and
reporter
meg
and
jim
hoagland
almost
always
go
along
to
one
or
several
country
to
observe
for
ourselves
what
we
have
be
reading
about
in
the
page
of
our
own
publication
the
number
of
these
trip
picked
up
in
the
early
s
largely
because
dick
s
steady
hand
would
be
at
the
helm
while
i
be
go
on
one
of
the
first

later

he
spent
the
entire
interview
complain
of
his
treatment
by
the
west
while
we
try
to
ask
question
about
his
persecution
of
different
religious
and
ethnic
group
and
his
repression
of
dissent
the
interview
be
stilted
to
say
the
least
we
take
turn
ask
predetermine
question
which
he
answer
at
length
and
mechanically

that
we
be
in
a
state
of
mild
terror

but
we
be
told
that
our
even
be
allow
to
disembark
from
the

third
most
powerful

in
the
country
and
the
head
of
its
national
guard
turn
out
to
be
something
out
of
the
thousand
and
one
arabian
night
we
drove
up
to
his
palace

demurely
in
long
skirt
and
long
sleeved
blouse

everything
we
possibly
could
and
step
into
a
large
oval
room
around
the
wall
of
which
member
of
the

sat
cross

kind
of
throne

be
position
even
high
than
ours
in
which
sat
prince

learn
later
that
abdullah
have
have
to
explain
to
his
men
for
an
hour
beforehand
why
he
have

several
small
tape
recorder
go
as
he
talk
the
egyptian
a
single
large
one
we
be
impressed
to
see
a
man
emerge
as
if
by
magic
from
behind
the
bush
in
the
garden
to
change
the
tape
sadat
kept
address
me
personally
with
brutally
offensive
remark
about
some
of
his
neighbor

would
say
jimmy
refer
to
carter
told
me
i
can
t
say
this
katharine
of
king
hussein
and
then
he
would
go
on
to
make
some
derisive
and
cut
remark
he
also
have
some
biting
thing
to
say
about
henry
kissinger
but
it
be
an
interest
interview
and
everyone
go
straight
to
work
write
it
up
for
the
post
and
newsweek
we
be
amuse
when
an
egyptian
government
man
appear
somewhat
embarrass
to
ask
us
for
a
copy
of
our
tape
from
the
interview
since
their
recorder
hadn
t
work
later
we
be
dumbstruck
to
discover
that
whereas
we
have
observe
their
ground
rule
and
have
omit
all
the
startle
remark
sadat
have
make
the
transcript
of
the
interview
ran
in
its
entirety
in
an
egyptian
paper
complete
with
the
acerbic
aside
address
to
me
i
hate
to
think
of
the
repercussion
these
may
have
cause
while
we
be
in
egypt
i
ask
to
see
the
shah
of
iran
to
whom
the
egyptian
have
give
refuge
and
at
the
last
minute
they
agree
to
allow
jim
and
me
in
the
shah
be
perfectly
willing
even
eager
to
talk
at
length
and
on
the
record
and
indeed
he
spoke
for
two
hour
flay
the
british
and
the
american
for
turn
their
back
on
him
he
regret
as
jim
note
in
the
lead
to
his
story
have
follow
a
policy
of
surrender
to
his
opponent
during
his
final
day
in
power
and
say
he
wish
he
have
use
military
force
to
put
down
the
demonstration
that
broke
his
rule
he
told
us
that
it
be
his
own
miscalculation
couple
with
conflict
signal
from
the
american
and
british
government
that
have
cause
him
to
fail
our
interview
with
the
shah
turn
out
to
be
his
final
one
since
he
die
shortly
thereafter
in
israel
nothing
equal
our
last
dinner
there
which
be
host
by
the
director
general
of
the
ministry
of
foreign
affair
a
dinner
that
degenerate
into
a
savage
attack
on
the
post
in
general
and
its
editorial
policy
in
particular
at
one
point
meg
spoke
up
to
rebut
these
attack
say
that
the
israeli
need
to
understand
that
one
couldn
t
help
be
humble
by
all
that
the
jew
have
experienced
in
europe
and
by
the
danger
they
be
in
now
and
that
nobody
she
knew
thought
otherwise
but
what
we
be
write
be
our
idea
of
what
have
to
be
do
to
avoid
a
terrible
fate
with
that
the
question
begin
and
grow
increasingly
hostile
the
israeli
be
especially
vicious
to
meg
who
be
jewish
be
someone
they
thought
ought
to
espouse
their
view
uncritically
one
of
the
most
bizarre
of
the
interview
we
held
during
these
trip
be
with
muammar
qaddafi
of
libya
jim
hoagland
chris
dickey
of
newsweek
and
i
have
go
to
north
africa
in
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
growth
of
fundamentalism
there
we
succeed
in
a
last
minute
request
to
interview
qaddafi
who
be
in
algeria
at
the
time
with
the
leader
of
that
country
and
tunisia
and
we
be
flown
to
where
the
leader
be
meeting
and
where
we
be
to
see
qaddafi
we
be
all
startle
to
be
told
that
he
want
to
see
me
alone
first
but
i
walk
into
our
agree
upon
meeting
place
and
qaddafi
receive
me
in
a
small
room
rise
from
a
leather
chair
to
greet
me
politely
we
exchange
small
talk
and
then
he
quickly
lead
the
discussion
to
bob
woodward
s
book
on
the
cia
veil
which
have
just
come
out
and
in
which
bob
have
report
on
the
cia
s
have
collect
information
about
certain
of
qaddafi
s
proclivity
allege
that
he
have
be
know
to
wear
makeup
and
high
heel
shoe
and
that
his
aide
have
bought
a
toy
teddy
bear
for
him
qaddafi
like
everyone
else
be
concerned
about
what
have
be
write
about
him
what
i
particularly
notice
be
his
eye
they
never
stop
roll
around
look
everywhere
but
straight
at
you
he
use
an
interpreter
but
seem
to
know
a
lot
of
english
and
occasionally
even
correct
the
interpreter
s
attempt
to
soften
his
language
my
meeting
with
qaddafi
go
on
long
enough
so
that
jim
get
edgy
and
finally
he
and
chris
decide
to
interrupt
when
the
interview
be
over
i
ask
if
i
could
take
qaddafi
s
picture
when
he
agree
my
camera
inconveniently
jammed
i
be
so
frustrate
that
i
give
it
a
powerful
hit
and
it
somehow
work
i
get
a
sufficiently
good
photo
so
that
newsweek
use
it
in
a
story
and
give
me
a
credit
as
a
freelancer
as
well
as
a
check
for
which
i
frame
probably
the
most
demand
interview
on
all
our
trip
be
the
one
we
do
with
soviet
leader
mikhail
gorbachev
later
that
year
jim
and
i
have
be
work
on
set
up
an
interview
with
the
soviet
president
for
about
five
year
and
through
three
different
president
chernenko
have
agree
but
be
take
ill
and
die
andropov
have
then
give
us
hope
of
an
interview
when
he
too
get
sick
and
die
when
gorbachev
come
along
i
immediately
start
again
and
be
frustrate
when
both
tom
brokaw
of
nbc
and
time
magazine
precede
us
finally
just
before
a
summit
meeting
with
president
reagan
an
interview
in
moscow
be
grant
and
we
work
terribly
hard
prepare
for
it
right
up
to
the
last
minute
when
we
go
into
the
meeting
room
gorbachev
come
on
in
his
usual
strong
charismatic
way
but
as
soon
as
we
sat
down
and
begin
ask
question
there
be
a
noticeable
change
in
his
manner
he
be
no
less
articulate
than
he
have
be
when
i
d
met
him
at
official
function
in
washington
but
he
seem
strangely
subdue
in
voice
and
demeanor
even
laid
back
in
the
physical
sense
however
he
start
sit
upright
and
tense
up
as
the
question
grow
distasteful
to
him
react
almost
physically
to
question
about
possible
dissension
in
the
politburo
and
the
jailing
of
vocal
dissident
nevertheless
he
answer
at
length
in
a
very
control
fashion
until
he
cut
off
the
interview
abruptly
after
the
fifth
question
which
be
about
human
right
so
nervous
be
gorbachev
about
any
hint
of
dissension
in
the
central
committee
that
he
have
nikolai
shishlin
an
important
central
committee
official
call
the
post
s
moscow
bureau
to
pas
on
the
message
that
he
didn
t
want
to
be
quote
as
mention
the
name
of
anyone
from
the
politburo
bob
kaiser
take
the
call
from
shishlin
who
also
say
that
since
president
gorbachev
didn
t
want
any
politburo
person
name
in
the
transcript
of
question
that
have
be
ask
we
would
have
to
reformulate
one
of
the
question
that
have
specifically
refer
to
yegor
ligachev
a
conservative
antireformer
and
gorbachev
s
repute
chief
rival
at
the
time
shishlin
told
kaiser
let
s
play
this
by
moscow
rule
kaiser
s
response
be
that
since
he
be
ask
us
to
use
the
soviet
official
transcript
of
the
interview
rather
than
our
own
only
i
could
make
that
decision
after
we
insist
that
it
be
impossible
for
us
to
delete
ligachev
s
name
from
the
interview
shishlin
call
the
bureau
again
to
say
that
gorbachev
himself
want
georgi
arbatov
the
soviet
union
s
foremost
americanologist
to
deliver
a
message
to
me
arbatov
found
me
in
the
apartment
of
gary
lee
the
post
s
moscow
correspondent
where
several
of
us
have
gather
and
he
and
i
go
into
a
separate
room
so
that
he
could
talk
with
me
alone
he
argue
hard
that
we
owe
this
small
favor
to
gorbachev
who
have
grant
me
the
big
favor
of
the
interview
i
say
i
be
sorry
but
this
be
not
a
favor
within
my
power
to
grant
once
we
have
ask
a
question
it
be
unthinkable
to
go
back
and
edit
the
question
we
wouldn
t
even
do
this
for
our
own
president
much
less
another
country
s
i
held
firm
after
a
while
we
join
the
others
and
when
he
rise
to
leave
shishlin
who
have
accompany
arbatov
look
at
me
and
say
don
t
worry
you
won
t
be
arrest
we
never
learn
why
gorbachev
be
so
sensitive
about
have
ligachev
s
name
mention
and
soon
thereafter
as
bob
kaiser
point
out
gorbachev
willingly
answer
a
question
about
his
relation
with
ligachev
with
no
sign
of
sensitivity
the
gorbachev
interview
be
in
some
way
the
cap
of
all
these
trip
with
meg
and
jim
and
others
which
be
such
an
important
part
of
my
life
for
fifteen
year
or
more
we
log
ten
of
thousand
of
mile
over
the
year
in
travel
to
south
africa
the
philippine
china
korea
japan
india
and
country
throughout
the
middle
east
and
south
america
although
don
be
the
publisher
of
the
post
and
editorially
responsible
for
the
paper
with
his
encouragement
i
stayed
involve
in
way
that
never
interfere
with
his
authority
these
trip
be
one
way
receive
certain
foreign
visitor
be
another
often
people
i
have
met
abroad
come
to
washington
and
i
would
invite
them
to
the
post
for
editorial
lunch
i
also
often
entertain
people
at
my
house
for
the
most
part
i
didn
t
give
public
dinner
just
for
the
sake
of
give
them
they
almost
always
serve
some
purpose
frequently
the
guest
of
honor
be
people
we
have
met
on
our
editorial
trip
both
president
kaunda
of
zambia
and
president
mugabe
of
zimbabwe
come
when
they
be
in
washington
as
do
willy
brandt
v
clav
havel
and
helen
suzman
occasionally
because
i
have
the
room
and
the
facility
to
accommodate
sizable
group
and
because
i
have
the
staff
to
bring
an
event
together
without
too
much
effort
i
be
ask
by
go
betweens
to
entertain
prominent
visitor
this
be
the
case
with
president
febres
cordero
of
ecuador
and
with
the
king
and
queen
of
jordan
i
be
happy
to
do
it
though
somewhat
to
my
dismay
i
begin
to
see
myself
mention
in
the
press
as
a
prominent
washington
hostess
a
term
i
very
much
disliked
again
it
seem
to
me
a
sexist
way
of
view
what
i
be
do
which
to
me
be
a
natural
part
of
my
job
i
also
felt
strongly
that
it
be
part
of
my
job
to
keep
up
with
people
in
and
out
of
office
it
be
all
in
my
day
s
work
to
get
to
know
those
in
government
and
help
them
know
journalist
many
of
my
dinner
involve
member
of
various
administration
over
the
year
and
could
be
described
as
political
although
they
be
always
nonpartisan
or
at
least
bipartisan
i
have
be
friend
with
president
from
both
political
party
but
any
relationship
even
an
old
one
can
grow
strain
when
you
become
as
i
do
a
symbol
of
a
major
newspaper
and
magazine
and
the
target
of
presidential
displeasure
this
occur
with
johnson
nixon
and
bush
but
curiously
not
much
with
reagan
ford
be
professionally
friendly
except
for
entertain
the
clinton
on
martha
s
vineyard
when
they
be
there
on
vacation
i
have
have
little
contact
with
them
they
have
be
polite
but
be
of
a
young
generation
so
it
s
perfectly
natural
those
who
come
to
washington
as
president
and
who
haven
t
live
here
and
know
the
city
as
have
for
example
jack
kennedy
lyndon
johnson
and
even
richard
nixon
seem
to
have
a
skewed
idea
of
socialize
between
people
from
the
press
and
people
from
the
administration
there
be
those
in
both
group
who
feel
that
we
shouldn
t
see
each
other
except
in
work
situation
though
i
recognize
that
this
issue
of
friendship
or
relationship
be
a
touchy
one
i
take
a
different
view
a
hand
off
approach
may
be
best
for
those
who
be
cover
people
in
the
government
but
for
a
publisher
i
feel
sure
openness
be
best
i
consider
it
the
role
of
the
head
of
a
newspaper
to
be
bipartisan
and
to
bring
journalist
together
with
people
from
government
i
think
that
an
easy
relationship
be
constructive
and
useful
for
both
side
it
help
the
publication
by
opening
door
and
provide
those
who
be
cover
in
the
news
with
the
knowledge
of
whom
they
can
suggest
idea
to
complain
to
or
generally
deal
with
when
people
don
t
feel
easy
enough
to
call
they
just
sit
there
grind
their
teeth
i
fear
unspoken
anger
especially
people
who
may
disagree
on
politics
must
still
be
able
to
communicate
and
it
s
crucial
for
all
of
us
in
the
press
to
listen
to
all
side
jimmy
carter
be
one
of
those
outsider
president
who
found
it
difficult
to
find
the
right
modus
operandi
for
washington
one
spring
night
just
a
year
into
carter
s
presidency
ben
bradlee
and
i
give
a
reception
for
the
american
society
of

have
be
three
dozen
or
so
editor
from
all
over
the

so
i
try

chief
of

polite
but
firm
regret
incredibly
i
never
even
receive
an
answer
from
the
press
secretary
jody
powell
think
how
stupid
it
be
for
the
press
secretary
to
ignore
an
event
involve
so
many
top
editor
i
call
his
office
and
ask
to
speak
to
him
i
be
told
he
be
in
a
meeting
i
explain
about
the
party
and
that
i
felt
it
would
be
useful
for
him
to
attend
still
no
answer
and
he
didn
t
come
some
year
later
after
carter
have
left
office
another
such
party
take
place
powell
be
present
and
he
and
his
wife
nan
be
charm
in
fact
he
brought
a
harmonica
and
dance
and
sang
late
into
the
even
later
too
i
get
to
know
hamilton
jordan
and
his
ability
and
his
charm
be
evident
i
give
a
dinner
for
him
at
which
my
toast
begin
hamilton
welcome
to
the
establishment
he
reply
that
if
he
have
join
earlier
jimmy
carter
might
still
be
in
the
white
house
i
don
t
know
that
that
s
true
but
i
do
believe
that
the
carter
administration
miss
some
good
opportunity
with
all
of
carter
s
trouble
both
inside
and
outside
washington
during
his
presidency
it
be
no
surprise
when
ronald
reagan
defeat
him
to
become
the
fortieth
president
of
the
united
state
i
have
met
the
reagan
several
year
before
they
come
to
washington
as
president
and
first
lady
truman
capote
told
me
he
have
gotten
to
know
them
in
the
course
of
some
research
he
be
do
on
death
sentence
in
which
he
have
become
interested
after
write
in
cold
blood
honey
i
know
you
won
t
believe
me
but
you
d
really
like
them
truman
told
me
in
his
falsetto
voice
truman
be
right
we
get
along
well
and
begin
a
long
friendship
that
puzzle
many
people
in
washington
when
the
reagan
first
come
to
washington
after
the
election
they
give
a
dinner
for
washingtonian
who
be
active
in
one
way
or
another
i
be
unable
to
accept
because
of
an
out
of
town
speech
but
decide
to
invite
them
in
return
and
be
delighted
when
they
accepted
shape
a
dinner
for
a
president
be
tricky
there
be
a
delicate
line
to
be
drawn
as
one
try
to
center
it
on
them
to
give
them
a
good
time
and
in
a
sense
to
ignore
all
else
include
hurt
feeling
and
pressure
from
people
who
would
like
to
be
there
or
think
they
should
be
there
the
night
the
reagan
arrive
for
the
dinner
my
two
wonderful
longtime
maid
lucy
and
dora
be
lean
out
a
second
floor
window
watch
the
limousine
pull
up
they
saw
presidentelect
reagan
step
out
and
embrace
me
kiss
me
on
both
cheek
dora
a
forceful
and
funny
woman
turn
to
lucy
and
say
i
hope
she
enjoy
that
because
that
s
the
last
time
that
will
ever
happen
dora
be
wise
in
the
way
of
washington
and
ordinarily
right
but
in
this
instance
she
be
wrong
in
our
toast
at
that
first
dinner
we
spoke
about
the
advantage
of
know
each
other
which
both
the
presidentelect
and
i
firmly
believe
in
for
reagan
however
there
be
repercussion
from
come
to
dinner
at
my
house
the
political
right
be
appalled
one
newspaper
feature
a
photograph
of
him
embrace
me
which
the
wall
street
journal
call
a
photograph
that
may
upset
arch
conservative
almost
as
much
as
the
famous
one
of
jimmy
carter
bussing
leonid
brezhnev
at
the
vienna
summit
howard
phillips
head
of
the
conservative
caucus
lit
into
reagan
in
remark
at
the
religious
roundtable
say
you
cannot
always
have
kay
graham
go
to
your
cocktail
party
and
smile
at
you
if
by
june
the
washington
establishment
be
happy
with
ronald
reagan
then
you
should
be
unhappy
with
ronald
reagan
with
some
ups
and
down
we
manage
to
remain
friend
throughout
the
eight
year
of
reagan
s
administration
at
some
point
nancy
and
i
start
lunch
together
regularly
at
first
just
the
two
of
us
would
have
long
gossipy
lunch
later
meg
join
us
either
at
my
house
or
hers
probably
the
most
public
time
nancy
and
i
have
be
a
weekend
she
spent
with
me
on
the
vineyard
in
august
i
couldn
t
imagine
nancy
on
the
liberal
and
distinctly
unchic
vineyard
and
thought
mike
deaver
be
mad
to
suggest
such
a
thing
but
when
i
invite
her
she
say
yes
right
away
and
she
come
along
with
the
deavers
and
meg
and
warren
it
be
a
typical
vineyard
weekend
very
informal
with
walk
on
the
beach
and
casual
dinner
i
think
nancy
enjoy
it
and
i
know
i
do
despite
the
solid
week
of
work
and
planning
our
last
dinner
at
my
house
be
in
november
after
the
election
in
just
as
the
reagan
be
get
ready
to
leave
washington
for
california
security
surround
the
president
have
gotten
much
tighter
although
my
door
sits
way
back
from
the
street
i
be
ask
to
put
up
a
tent
so
that
the
president
could
get
out
of
his
car
conceal
from
view
when
i
brought
them
in
i
be
told
not
to
take
them
into
the
living
room
because
by
then
it
be
too
crowd
but
i
simply
ignore
this
and
do
so
and
they
be
both
quickly
surround
by
well
wish
friend
the
throng
create
one
minor
problem
when
someone
knock
against
a
glass
which
spill
a
drink
with
ice
onto
the
floor
i
be
dumbstruck
at
see
the
president
of
the
united
state
down
on
his
hand
and
knee
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
pick
up
the
ice
on
the
phone
the
next
day
nancy
told
me
this
remind
her
of
something
that
have
happen
in
the
hospital
after
the
assassination
attempt
the
president
who
be
not
suppose
to
get
out
of
bed
go
to
the
bathroom
and
spill
some
water
on
the
floor
in
the
process
when
attendant
come
in
he
be
on
his
hand
and
knee
wipe
it
up
ask
why
he
say
he
be
afraid
the
nurse
would
get
into
trouble

the
natural
arm
s
length
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
press
always
take
on
an
even
more
adversarial
nature
during
any
presidential
campaign
the
election
year
of
be
no
exception
there
be
the
usual
stress
and
strain
with
both
bush
and
michael
dukakis
his
democratic
opponent
and
there
be
some
unusual
one
both
candidate
of
course
complain
about
our
coverage
of
their
campaign
both
visit
the
paper
for
editorial
lunch
but
our
trouble
with
each
of
them
mount
sharply
as
do
our
editorial
dismay
at
their
campaign
i
have
know
george
bush
for
year
not
intimately
but
pleasantly
my
father
have
invest
in
the
oil
company
bush
have
start
as
a
young
man
and
i
like
both
george
and
barbara
and
thought
of
them
as
fine
moderate
republican
in
the
tradition
of
his
father
senator
prescott
bush
whom
i
have
also
know
i
hadn
t
see
much
of
them
in
the
previous
eight
year
when
he
have
serve
as
vice
president
but
be
well
aware
that
he
have
be
loyal
to
reagan
politically
as
well
as
personally
newsweek
however
have
gotten
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
candidate
when
it
publish
the
very
week
bush
have
announce
his
intention
to
run
for
president
a
cover
story
on
the
vice
president
title
fight
the
wimp
factor
the
wimp
label
have
be
a
thorn
in
the
bush
campaign
flesh
since
that
time
the
profile
of
bush
have
be
fair
and
complete
but
the
effect
of
the
word
wimp
cry
out
from
the
cover
on
newsstand
everywhere
be
hard
to
overcome
what
follow
be
not
untypical
the
bush
people
distance
themselves
from
newsweek
reporter
finally
in
september
a
meeting
be
set
up
at
the
vice
president
s
residence
between
rick
smith
evan
thomas
and
me
from
newsweek
and
bush
jim
baker
and
craig
fuller
bush
s
chief
of
staff
bush
claimed
that
the
whole
story
have
be
wildly
distort
by
play
up
the
word
on
the
cover
for
which
he
accurately
blame
the
editor
his
family
whom
he
d
ask
to
cooperate
on
the
story
be
naturally
upset
and
angry
and
have
advise
him
that
far
cooperation
with
the
magazine
in
any
but
a
technically
correct
manner
would
only
prove
the
point
that
he
be
indeed
a
wimp
i
earnestly
try
to
explain
about
the
complicate
newsweekly
process
until
bush
without
relent
say
that
rick
smith
and
jim
baker
should
talk
as
the
vice
president
and
i
walk
toward
the
door
he
whisper
to
me
in
the
nice
possible
way
we
ll
work
it
out
but
don
t
tell
them
rick
do
get
together
with
baker
and
manage
to
clear
the
air
enough
so
that
we
could
do
the
necessary
background
reporting
but
the
issue
never
really
die
and
be
compound
by
others
we
that
be
reporter
and
editor
from
both
the
post
and
newsweek
have
of
course
also
met
with
dukakis
throughout
the
winter
and
spring
he
have
make
a
poor
impression
in
several
area
but
especially
in
national
security
policy
his
campaign
manager
call
me
late
in
the
campaign
and
say
the
candidate
would
like
to
meet
with
several
of
us
informally
i
go
with
a
group
from
the
post
and
newsweek
hop
we
would
see
a
side
of
dukakis
we
hadn
t
see
before
and
get
to
know
him
a
little
as
an
individual
we
all
sat
around
his
hotel
room
and
he
talk
but
nothing
new
be
say
and
nothing
personal
about
his
view
be
reveal
despite
his
campaign
which
i
disliked
i
vote
for
bush
i
thought
dukakis
too
inexperienced
to
govern
it
be
my
only
republican
vote
for
president
after
bush
be
elect
our
relation
be
unexpectedly
cool
if
not
hostile
throughout
the
four
year
of
his
administration
i
rarely
saw
him
and
barbara
except
occasionally
in
long
receive
line
perhaps
my
amicable
relation
with
the
reagan
and
with
george
shultz
for
whom
the
bush
have
no
love
compound
our
problem
these
cool
or
antagonistic
relationship
be
part
of
life
in
washington
and
be
accepted
as
such
but
i
often
think
how
self
defeat
they
be
and
how
much
well
polite
professional
relation
would
serve
political
figure
and
journalist
in
situation
like
this
i
agree
with
a
charm
message
i
get
from
george
mcgovern
after
he
have
be
defeat
for
the
presidency
he
recall
make
some
bitter
remark
about
a
couple
of
our
columnist
at
a
dinner
party
but
write
me
i
have
regret
that
outburst
and
i
have
also
establish
that
the
maximum
time
i
can
carry
a
grudge
be
about
three
month
this
note
be
simply
to
say
that
i
have
now
forgotten
all
campaign
grudge
it
be
just
too
difficult
try
to
remember
which
people
i
m
suppose
to
shun
with
rare
exception
i
feel
strongly
that
mcgovern
s
rule
be
an
appropriate
one
for
all
of
us
the
longer
i
live
the
more
i
observe
that
carry
around
anger
be
most
debilitate
to
the
person
who
bear
it
in
the
immediate
year
follow
phil
s
death
it
be
terribly
difficult
for
me
to
separate
my
work
life
from
my
private
life
they
be
clearly
so
intermingle
for
year
i
have
be
on
a
kind
of
automatic
pilot
try
to
give
attention
to
so
many
aspect
of
life
at
once
with
two
child
still
at
home
in
the
first
year
friend
business
acquaintance
always
too
much
work
too
many
meeting
too
many
dinner
party
fortunately
somewhere
along
the
line
perhaps
with
the
help
of
lesson
learn
from
the
woman
s
movement
i
begin
to
have
a
happier
time
in
my
private
life
family
and
friend
have
always
be
vital
to
me
but
at
some
point
i
start
to
enjoy
other
people
as
well
to
connect
more
even
to
appreciate
male
friend
more
there
be
always
men
in
my
life
romance
and
close
friend
and
i
enjoy
them
all
as
long
as
phil
be
alive
i
so
adore
him
that
i
never
thought
about
another
relationship
in
truth
that
one
man
woman
think
stayed
with
me
for
year
and
vestige
be
there
still
i
have
often
be
ask
why
i
never
remarry
in
my
early
year
at
work
i
resent
the
question
which
i
felt
would
not
be
ask
of
a
male
publisher
i
usually
answer
that
i
really
didn
t
know
why
i
still
don
t
know
all
the
reason
but
what
i
come
to
understand
be
that
my
job
make
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
men
who
appeal
to
me
be
strong
bright
tough
and
involve
but
that
kind
of
man
would
probably
not
accept
my
own
active
and
absorb
life
those
men
need
more
attention
and
emotional
energy
than
i
have
left
over
at
the
end
of
any
work
day
and
i
wasn
t
look
for
a
prince
consort
in
fact
i
wasn
t
look
at
all
because
i
be
so
engross
in
what
i
be
do
i
rarely
give
a
thought
to
possible
remarriage
when
i
do
think
of
it
it
occur
to
me
that
although
the
idea
have
some
appeal
it
would
almost
surely
never
happen
when
you
ve
live
alone
for
a
number
of
year
i
m
afraid
that
you
begin
to
realize
how
hard
it
would
be
to
accommodate
to
living
with
someone
else
adjust
to
or
even
indulge
his
desire
and
his
life
it
be
clear
to
me
that
i
be
married
to
my
job
and
that
i
love
it
when
marriage
work
and
it
do
take
a
lot
of
work
it
s
the
best
way
to
live
i
enjoy
be
around
married
people
who
really
love
each
other
be
constantly
polite
and
care
about
each
other
and
between
whom
you
feel
a
real
and
supportive
relationship
henry
and
nancy
kissinger
be
example
for
me
of
two
people
who
be
very
much
in
love
with
each
other
henry
tease
complains
whine
at
this
or
that
but
he
once
told
me
he
couldn
t
exist
without
nancy
scotty
and
sally
reston
have
a
model
marriage
for
nearly
fifty
year
i
love
watch
them
together
and
understood
how
much
they
meant
to
each
other
scotty
write
me
once
i
cannot
imagine
how
i
could
have
endure
these
year
without
sally
and
do
not
know
how
you
have
borne
them
without
your
guy
what
i
believe
to
be
true
be
that
i
couldn
t
have
borne
the
dreariness
of
life
without
phil
have
my
life
remain
the
one
i
have
before
he
die
but
mine
be
a
change
life
and
i
couldn
t
imagine
a
new
marriage
work
for
me
once
i
take
over
the
post
company
be
single
pose
some
difficulty
however
especially
for
weekend
in
the
country
vacation
and
summer
moment
when
two
people
together
do
much
well
after
a
while
i
knew
i
have
to
figure
out
some
way
to
spend
these
time
alone
or
with
my
family
buying
a
house
on
martha
s
vineyard
be
a
step
that
alter
my
life
very
much
for
the
well
and
add
greatly
to
my
happiness
when
i
first
found
the
house
it
be
completely
tumble
down
have
be
rent
by
people
who
basically
camped
in
it
but
i
love
its
shape
and
the
way
it
sat
on
the
beautiful
land
from
my
first
look
at
it
i
begin
to
imagine
that
the
house
could
become
a
family
center
if
the
child
like
it
or
they
could
leave
grandchild
with
me
if
they
want
to
travel
since
i
bought
it
in
and
renovate
it
the
follow
year
i
have
spent
every
august
there
and
my
child
and
grandchild
love
it
as
much
as
i
do
my
stay
there
always
restore
me
so
the
vineyard
help
my
summer
and
my
friend
help
throughout
the
year
the
life
of
those
of
us
who
stay
on
in
washington
change
somewhat
with
a
change
of
administration
but
our
core
friendship
remain
pretty
much
the
same
there
be
a
say
about
relationship
in
washington
if
you
want
a
friend
in
washington
get
a
dog
maybe
because
i
ve
always
live
here
because
this
be
in
a
very
real
sense
my
hometown
i
ve
found
that
not
to
be
at
all
true
i
m
sure
it
s
different
if
you
arrive
here
as
a
member
of
a
new
administration
it
always
take
a
while
to
make
new
friend
in
a
strange
town
and
undoubtedly
there
will
be
people
who
try
to
wangle
friendship
with
those
in
power
in
order
to
use
them
for
one
reason
or
another

who
have
be
defeat
for
election
to
the

in
and

now

mexico
be
quote
as
say
he
have
learn
during
his
tenure
here
about
friend
and
friend
of
convenience
but
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
the
fact
that
people
in
power
often
deal
with
others
on
more
than
one
level
sometimes
you
become
friend
with
people
with
whom
you
work
because
of
some
common
interest
or
just
because
you
have
to
work
together
but
there
be
also
relationship
that
start
out
that
way
yet
cross
over
to
become
real
friendship
that
last
forever
some
of
my
deepest
friendship
begin
with
an
administration
person
whom
i
get
to
know
because
of
my
association
with
the
paper
bob
mcnamara
and
henry
kissinger
come
immediately
to
mind
but
grow
over
time
into
relationship
whose
core
have
nothing
to
do
with
politics
or
work
this
be
true
of
others

also
developed
into
something
beyond
that
for
me
george

and
i
have
be
friend
when
he
be
in

and
he
be
one
of
the
few
administration
official
who
remain
friend
with
me
through
watergate
i
admire
and
like
him
we
remet
at
dinner
at

house
when
he
return
as
secretary
of
state
under
president

he
ask
if
i
be
still
play
tennis
and
say
he
d
love
to
play
so
i
work
him
into
a
game
the
follow
weekend
and
we
fell
into
a
routine
of
sunday
game
with
more
or
less
the
same
foursome
we
soon
add
saturday
game
and
end
up
play
every
weekend
for
six
year
unless
he
be
away
on
trip
he
love
the
game
so
much
that
he
go
to
great
length
to
be
there
once
he
be
engage
in
some
heavy
negotiation
have
to
do
with
the
middle
east
and
i
assume
he
would
skip
tennis
but
he
insist
on
play
wonder
how
he
have
gotten
out
of
his
meeting
i
ask
him
what
he
have
told
yitzhak
shamir
with
whom
he
have
be
talk
it
didn
t
surprise
me
at
all
to
learn
that
he
have
say
i
m
go
to
play
tennis
another
time
during
a
particularly
hard
match
bill
webster
then
head
of
the
fbi
and
i
both
go
for
the
same
ball
and
collide
i
go
down
so
hard
i
be
afraid
i
d
broken
my
hip
and
a
baseball
size
lump
quickly
form
on
my
rear
end
in
the
car
george
ask
if
i
be
all
right
or
if
he
should
take
me
to
an
emergency
room
i
m
fine
i
told
him
but
i
have
this
huge
bump
on
my
behind
if
it
weren
t
for
your
security
men
i
d
let
you
feel
it
from
drive
together
to
and
from
our
game
our
friendship
deepen
i
must
have
spent
as
much
time
with
george
as
anyone
in
washington
except
obie
his
devote
wife
who
die
recently
but
i
never
learn
anything
professional
from
him
in
all
those
hour
we
spent
in
his
car
though
i
must
say
it
be
apparent
that
something
be
wrong
during
iran
contra
he
would
make
oblique
remark
and
be
visibly
disturbed
and
down
always
george
be
the
soul
of
discretion
and
integrity
i
don
t
believe
that
whom
i
be
or
wasn
t
friend
with
interfere
with
our
reporting
at
any
of
our
publication
or
at
the
station
most
of
the
editor
didn
t
know
or
care
whom
i
knew
more
important
i
understood
my
priority
in
any
altercation
between
the
publication
and
people
who
be
friend
i
back
our
reporter
occasionally
if
i
thought
we
d
be
unfair
i
would
ask
about
it
but
only
in
an
effort
to
try
to
ensure
even
hand
treatment
if
there
be
a
complete
conflict
of
interest
that
be
if
a
friendship
develops
and
the
paper
have
to
report
something
negative
that
have
to
do
with
your
friend
you
either
lose
the
friend
or
if
you
re
lucky
have
one
who
be
big
enough
to
forgive
and
eventually
maybe
forget
i
be
move
inexorably
toward
the
end
of
my
seventh
decade
and
be
enjoy
myself
increasingly
with
each
passing
year
up
to
now
i
have
never
mind
get
old
in
fact
i
hadn
t
thought
about
it
much
but
be
a
landmark
year
the
year
i
turn
seventy
and
this
be
a
birthday
i
really
do
mind
my
friend
luvie
pearson
have
try
to
soften
the
blow
by
assure
me
seventy
be
nothing

s
when
you
hit
seventy
five
that
you
really
begin
to
feel
it
and
then
you
feel
it
increasingly
from
my
experience
i
think
she
have
it
just
about
right
but
i
didn
t
know
that
at
the
time
and
be
bother
about
be
seventy
i
certainly
didn
t
want
to
broadcast
my
age
to
the
world
especially
not
to
the
business
world

along
with
the
idea
of
a
small
party
to
be
give
by
her

the
time
deeply
unhappy
joe
alsop
himself
be
another
great
loss
one
that
come
toward
the
end
of
the
decade
in
the
last
several
year
of
his
life
he
and
i
have
become
closer
than
ever
perhaps
the
fact
that
we
be
both
alone
then
he
and
susan
mary
have
separate
strengthen
our
connection
the
traffic
and
phone
call
between
our
georgetown
house
be
almost
constant
i
not
only
enjoy
joe
s
company
but
in
some
way
depend
on
it
we
need
each
other
he
be
important
in
my
life
and
i
in
his
more
than
almost
anyone
i
knew
joe
give
pleasure
and
get
pleasure
he
once
say
boredom
emptiness
complacency
be
the
real
enemy
and
never
experience
and
he
be
right
i
also
lose
my
dear
friend
luvie
pearson
on
whom
i
have
count
a
great
deal
for
so
many
year
she
be
wise
funny
brave
and
tolerant
her
devote
friend
malcolm
forbes
give
an
eightieth
birthday
party
for
her
on
his
yacht
which
be
then
anchor
in
new
york
harbor
luvie
look
as
beautiful
as
ever
her
sculpture
bony
face
lanky
frame
and
long
blond
hair
seem
never
to
have
change
but
she
confide
to
me
that
she
be
get
less
able
to
take
care
of
herself
she
be
bother
by
arthritis
in
her
hand
and
fear
have
to
leave
her
tiny
house
in
georgetown
for
a
retirement
home
two
year
later
just
as
her
health
be
get
precarious
luvie
die
suddenly
on
a
bridge
weekend
exactly
the
way
she
would
have
want
her
absence
left
me
very
sad
but
i
couldn
t
begrudge
my
friend
her
merciful
death
she
die
the
way
anyone
would
hope
to
with
all
her
marble
and
not
too
painfully
too
early
or
too
late
because
i
be
at
a
point
in
my
life
where
i
be
lose
friend
to
death
with
increase
frequency
i
have
try
to
follow
joe
alsop
s
advice
and
example
to
keep
develop
young
friend
i
do
that
both
because
i
enjoy
people
of
all
age
and
also
to
guard
against
loneliness
polly
my
closest
friend
for
nearly
fifty
year
remains
dear
to
me
always
thoughtful
kind
energetic
funny
and
brave
my
friendship
with
meg
have
grown
and
deepen
over
the
year
to
an
extent
for
which
i
be
infinitely
grateful
liz
hylton
my
treasure
assistant
who
begin
work
with
me
even
before
phil
s
death
remains
my
most
consistent
support
i
be
still
close
to
my
sister
bi
and
ruth
and
we
talk
often
and
visit
each
other
when
we
can
by
the
late
s
the
washington
post
company
be
clearly
a
success
the
stock
have
skyrocket
during
dick
s
fine
operating
year
beyond
my
wild
dream
reach
per
share
amaze
to
me
we
be
outperform
our
competition
in
all
our
division
our
quality
be
high
than
ever
we
be
as
warren
once
say
maximize
a
tail
wind
beyond
dick
s
obvious
contribution
to
the
success
of
the
company
i
think
there
be
several
thing
that
help
us
achieve
what
we
do
some
of
our
success
have
to
do
with
be
a
family
company
at
the
star
family
involvement
get
out
of
hand
too
many
family
for
one
thing
but
i
think
that
family
own
company
bring
special
quality
to
the
table
and
that
family
member
can
bring
singular
attribute
to
a
business
enterprise
possibly
quality
may
be
nourish
most
easily
by
a
family
whose
perspective
extends
beyond
the
immediate
horizon
there
be
exception
to
be
sure
but
family
member
can
provide
stability
and
continuity
and
family
ownership
can
prevent
takeover
which
be
important
to
smooth
operation
in
this
period
of
disruptive
and
often
ill
consider
merger
and
acquisition
another
factor
that
nudge
us
along
the
way
be
that
we
never
take
success
for
grant
in
all
our
division
our
business
compete
hard
in
every
sense
with
our
direct
competition
we
try
never
to
lose
a
subscription
we
have
a
chance
of
hold
we
work
never
to
let
an
inch
or
a
dollar
of
advertising
slip
away
without
a
fight
we
always
anguish
over
be
beaten
on
a
story
and
still
do
i
believe
that
our
concentration
on
journalistic
excellence
be
a
good
business
approach
as
well
as
a
necessary
editorial
strategy
i
think
that
this
be
yet
another
reason
for
our
ultimate
success
that
we
operate
under
the
philosophy
which
i
have
espouse
and
practice
from
the
time
i
take
over
the
company
and
which
i
believe
my
father
and
phil
do
before
me
and
don
be
do
now
that
journalistic
excellence
and
profitability
go
hand
in
hand
the
reason
for
put
it
that
way
in
the
begin
be
to
try
to
reassure
wall
street
that
i
care
about
profitability
we
have
spent
large
sum
on
building
up
the
editorial
product
at
the
post
newsweek
and
the
station
and
have
risk
a
lot
on
publishing
the
pentagon
paper
as
we
be
go
public
and
the
watergate
story
later
i
want
badly
to
answer
the
question
of
why
anyone
would
invest
in
this
company
i
have
to
try
to
assure
wall
street
that
i
wasn
t
some
madwoman
interested
only
in
risk
and
editorial
issue
but
that
i
be
also
concerned
with
how
we
ran
our
business
this
twin
concept
have
come
to
me
not
as
a
matter
of
profit
margin
and
business
goal
but
more
as
a
problem
of
management
i
thought
if
you
do
one
thing
well
focus
on
a
quality
product
the
result
would
follow
it
s
clear
that
the
mathematics
of
such
think
didn
t
seem
to
be
with
us
after
all
in
mathematical
equation
it
be
say
that
only
one
variable
can
be
maximize
at
a
time
but
i
think
that
we
help
prove
the
compatibility
of
these
two
goal
ours
be
a
good
record
and
a
good
run
and
it
be
finally
begin
to
be
recognize
as
such
by
the
industry
warren
be
kind
enough
to
talk
about
the
company
under
my
direction
at
a
special
award
lunch
give
in
by
the
center
for
communication
in
new
york
at
which
i
be
the
guest
of
honor
he
emphasize
what
he
call
the
less
well
report
part
of
the
story
of
the
company
s
success
at
that
time
our
record
of
earnings
per
share
increase
be
well
than
that
of
any
of
the
outstanding
company
in
our
field
the
average
growth
for
the
top
six
medium
company
be
percent
since
ours
at
percent
be
just
more
than
double
that
what
warren
didn
t
say
of
course
be
how
much
his
sage
advice
have
have
to
do
with
this
record
warren
also
joked
to
the
group
that
he
have
once
found
a
sheet
of
paper
prominently
displayed
on
my
desk
that
say
asset
on
the
left
liability
on
the
right
in
december
business
month
ran
a
cover
story
on
the
five
best
manage
company
which
put
the
washington
post
company
on
this
short
list
with
apple
merck
rubbermaid
and
wal
mart
a
few
year
later
i
receive
fortune
magazine
s
business
hall
of
fame
award
a
consummate
and
for
me
truly
gratify
honor
so
much
of
the
success
for
which
we
be
be
recognize
be
directly
attributable
to
dick
during
his
tenure
earnings
per
share
grow
at
an
annual
compound
rate
of
percent
and
return
on
equity
average
percent
beyond
whatever
tangible
accomplishment
could
be
point
to
or
measure
dick
set
a
high
standard
of
professional
management
for
the
company
that
s
why
it
be
so
difficult
to
think
about
his
ever
leave
but
almost
from
the
begin
he
have
warn
me
that
he
want
to
retire
when
he
be
still
young
enough
to
teach
and
to
pursue
some
of
his
other
interest
as
his
ninth
year
at
the
company
drew
to
a
close
dick
begin
to
talk
about
retire
and
at
least
a
year
before
the
company
s
annual
meeting
date
in
may
he
set
the
date
for
his
departure
i
prevail
on
him
to
stay
on
the
board
and
to
remain
as
president
of
the
international
herald
tribune
for
five
year
so
that
we
would
maintain
our
close
tie
as
dawn
it
be
clear
to
me
that
dick
s
impend
departure
meant
that
it
be
time
for
me
to
step
down
too
i
be
always
concerned
l
inertia
or
the
lack
of
desire
to
give
up
lead
me
to
stay
too
long
on
the
job
i
have
see
company
hurt
or
even
ruin
by
an
owner
ceo
not
step
down
at
the
right
time
so
i
be
glad
when
dick
s
move
in
a
sense
make
up
my
mind
for
me
i
also
felt
it
be
fitting
that
the
new
team
of
don
graham
as
president
and
alan
spoon
then
serve
as
president
of
newsweek
but
in
line
to
succeed
dick
as
the
company
s
chief
operating
officer
move
up
together
so
dick
and
i
step
down
at
the
same
time
from
our
position
as
chief
operating
and
chief
executive
officer
in
our
annual
report
don
write
a
lovely
personal
and
highly
unusual
piece
to
find
in
an
annual
report
if
you
re
look
for
objectivity
he
begin
please
turn
the
page
he
retrace
my
arrival
on
the
scene
and
my
lonely
place
as
the
only
woman
in
the
fortune
for
so
many
year
he
note
financial
result
and
highlight
editorial
issue
and
event
since
he
recall
my
residual
self
doubt
at
a
christmas
lunch
don
write
one
of
her
guest
ask
everyone
around
the
table
what
they
wish
they
have
do
earlier
in
life
most
say
they
wish
they
d
be
centerfielder
or
movie
star
kay
say
she
wish
she
d
go
to
harvard
business
school
which
be
still
true
of
me
today
i
be
unsure
how
i
would
react
at
the
inevitable
moment
of
step
down
and
worried
that
i
would
miss
the
authority
and
be
the
ultimate
responsible
person
in
the
post
company
fortunately
it
hasn
t
be
as
difficult
as
i
d
imagine
perhaps
part
of
this
be
because
i
relate
well
to
both
don
and
alan
and
they
be
careful
to
keep
me
inform
perhaps
too
it
s
because
it
be
a
gradual
departure
for
me
at
the
suggestion
of
several
of
the
company
s
director
i
retain
the
title
of
chairman
for
two
and
a
half
more
year
relinquish
it
in
september
of
when
i
become
chairman
of
the
three
person
executive
committee
of
the
company
consist
of
don
and
alan
and
me
ben
s
retirement
a
few
month
after
mine
in
when
he
reach
the
age
of
seventy
complete
a
smooth
transition
on
the
editorial
side
from
ben
and
me
to
len
downie
and
don
the
predictable
negative
story
appear
here
and
there
to
the
effect
that
don
and
len
be
low
key
more
interested
in
local
news
and
more
well
boring
this
be
the
same
kind
of
story
that
have
appear
about
me
when
i
be
new
people
be
judgmental
about
young
manager
and
like
to
compare
them
unfavorably
with
their
predecessor
but
len
have
gradually
take
over
run
the
news
side
of
the
paper
from
ben
in
the
precede
five
year
as
don
have
take
over
the
paper
and
some
of
what
i
do
at
the
company
he
d
already
be
publisher
for
more
than
twelve
year
when
he
become
president
and
later
chairman
ben
have
indeed
as
we
say
in
our
annual
report
that
year
redefine
the
post
for
a
generation
of
washingtonian
his
retirement
be
a
move
event
or
series
of
event
i
should
say
it
be
all
do
as
ben
do
everything
with
great
style
just
before
he
walk
out
of
the
newsroom
on
august
there
be
to
be
a
small
farewell
cake
and
champagne
party
for
him
it
turn
into
a
mass
uprise
with
many
spontaneous
speech
and
story
told
about
the
legendary
ben
story
about
people
whose
life
he
have
touch
so
many
uniquely
ben
incident
not
all
of
them
printable
no
one
want
to
leave
after
three
hour
don
remark
that
one
of
the
reporter
have
brought
her
new
baby
with
her
that
day
and
the
baby
be
about
to
celebrate
her
third
birthday
on
that
note
ben
walk
out
of
the
newsroom
and
out
of
the
building
but
certainly
not
out
of
the
life
of
the
post
he
remains
vice
president
at
large
a
title
at
which
he
always
grin
with
an
office
on
the
post
s
executive
floor
his
energy
and
charm
be
undiminished
he
be
busy
and
happy
and
productive
and
have
write
a
fascinate
and
well
receive
memoir
a
book
in
which
we
hear
his
true
voice
the
best
kind
of
book
without
the
major
responsibility
that
go
along
with
my
title
i
have
to
try
to
reshape
my
life
to
give
it
some
new
form
that
would
serve
not
merely
to
fill
my
day
but
to
give
some
real
meaning
to
what
my
friend
luvie
use
to
call
the
last
lap
it
s
hard
for
people
who
leave
power
to
relinquish
certain
enjoyable
thing
the
inside
seat
the
privileged
conversation
the
ultimate
responsibility
and
the
many
other
perquisite
that
go
along
with
the
kind
of
job
i
have
have
for
so
long
admittedly
many
of
us
get
spoil
by
all
of
the
benefit
of
our
job
i
certainly
do
but
i
also
believe
it
s
healthy
to
have
to
return
to
a
more
normal
life
there
be
advantage
to
private
pleasure
probably
more
so
if
you
have
manage
to
maintain
some
balance
during
your
year
at
the
top
which
i
try
to
do
but
of
course
i
be
still
spoil
in
many
way
certainly
by
be
able
to
pursue
the
myriad
interest
in
my
life
and
by
have
a
staff
both
in
the
office
and
at
home
to
support
me
in
all
that
i
do
in
configure
a
new
way
of
life
i
try
to
understand
what
i
need
to
retain
from
my
old
one
i
knew
it
be
important
to
keep
active
physically
and
mentally
i
have
return
to
play
bridge
which
i
love
and
hope
to
take
up
golf
and
maybe
even
continue
tennis
most
important
though
be
to
keep
work
i
knew
that
i
essentially
never
want
not
to
work
to
me
work
be
a
form
of
sustenance
like
food
or
water
and
nearly
as
essential
perhaps
this
be
a
direct
genetic
inheritance
from
my
parent
i
knew
too
that
though
i
would
still
be
involve
with
the
company
on
a
part
time
basis
i
need
something
else
reorganize
my
work
life
meant
find
a
new
kind
of
balance
i
focus
initially
on
continue
to
do
some
thing
for
the
company
and
become
more
involve
in
education
and
write
these
memoir
why
dare
to
write
a
book
what
make
any
of
us
think
that
someone
else
would
be
interested
in
story
from
our
own
past
for
me
there
be
a
mixture
of
motif
i
have
be
think
about
my
parent
who
with
their
drive
discipline
eccentricity
and
wealth
might
be
of
interest
even
to
nonfamily
people
also
i
felt
that
phil
s
story
have
not
be
told
his
brain
ability
and
charm
be
legendary
among
his
friend
but
no
one
have
write
fully
about
him
and
his
accomplishment
as
well
as
about
his
devastation
by
his
largely
untreated
manic
depression
partly
i
want
to
look
at
my
own
life
because
my
personal
history
contains
element
that
be
both
unexpected
and
unrepeatable
i
recognize
the
inherent
danger
of
be
self
serve
and
have
try
to
retain
as
much
detachment
as
possible
but
i
want
to
tell
what
happen
just
as
i
saw
it
and
in
the
process
i
hop
to
arrive
at
some
understand
of
how
people
be
form
by
the
way
they
grow
up
and
far
mold
by
the
way
they
spend
their
day
it
be
ironic
that
i
become
so
intensely
interested
in
education
which
take
up
so
much
of
my
mother
s
later
life
possibly
this
be
another
of
her
legacy
to
me
i
believe
as
she
do
that
education
be
not
only
the
most
important
societal
problem
but
the
most
interest
of
course
there
be
countless
number
of
education
project
be
implement
and
enormous
sum
be
spent
across
the
country
but
i
want
to
do
something
simple
and
direct
perhaps
make
life
a
little
well
for
a
few
child
without
try
to
prove
anything
or
get
encumber
in
a
large
bureaucracy
along
with
a
very
able
inspire
and
determine
young
partner
terry
golden
i
have
help
launch
an
early
childhood
education
project
in
the
anacostia
section
of
washington
d
c
though
the
project
as
a
whole
have
grown
large
than
i
have
envision
it
concentrate
on
two
housing
project
frederick
douglas
community
home
and
stanton
dwelling
and
aim
at
help
mostly
single
and
unemployed
parent
be
involve
in
the
education
of
their
child
we
have
raise
enough
money
to
help
create
a
community
service
center
for
parent
with
a
small
day
care
unit
for
up
to
fifteen

new
school
for
one
hundred
head
start
child
from
the
age
of

our
hope
be
that
this
be
a
public
private
endeavor
that
can
be
replicate
in
other
area
of
the
district

have
not
