a
great
solution
there
be
no
agreement
as
to
how
to
actually
get
the
sop
to
happen
step
up
to
the
change
it
be
a
january
night
in
the
retail
executive
be
wrestling
with
the
reality
that
the
solution
they
have
devise
to
fix
the
underlie
problem
in
the
store
be
flounder
they
begin
to
perceive
that
the
expansion
of
store
and
the
development
of
the
field
management
team
be
lead
to
neither
sustainable
operating
excellence
nor
profit
the
sop
upon
which
they
have
be
base
their
plan
for
improvement
be
simply
not
work
the
way
it
need
to
despite
its
promise
and
performance
in
several
test
store
store
management
be
not
apply
the
voluminously
document
manual
of
new

operating
procedure
the
development
of
which
have
involve
extensive
effort
and
multimillion
dollar
resource
people
be
just
not
implement
the
change
what
management
knew
be
critical
to
best
buy
success
be
stall
in
retrospect
one
of
the
retail
executive
say
we
do
not
fully
understand
the
complexity
of
behavioral
change
and
how
much
time
it
take
to
implement
a
consultant
be
on
hand
for
a
meeting
with
the
retail
executive
on
talent
selection
and
development
clearly
though
the
two
executive
be
distract
and
not
in
the
mood
to
talk
about
those
topic
one
of
them
express
his
frustration
i
do
not
get
it
the
new
sop
just
make
sense
why
be
not
they
the
people
in
the
store
use
it
it
be
to
their
advantage
we
design
it
to
make
their
life
easy
in
fact
they
design
it
what
the
hell
be
they
do
the
retail
executive
be
on
the
hook
for
the
successful
implementation
of
the
sop
in
the
field
when
the
consultant
heard
this
she
remember
hearing
alarm
go
off
in
november
and
december
when
she
be
in
the
field
store
manager
have
told
her
that
the
sop
be
not
work
and
that
they
would
only
superficially
support
it
they
have
give
several
reason
why
and
one
in
particular
have
stuck
in
her
memory
it
be
the
store
gm
in
houston
who
have
express
his
concern
the
sop
introduce
new
role
and
team
in
the
store
structure
the
people
who
land
on
the
sale
team
be
see
as
the
winner
and
the
people
who
land
on
the
merchandising
team
be
see
as
the
loser
the
teamwork
across
the
store
be
break
down
people
be
take
side
and
the
antagonism
keep
grow
the
consultant
push
deeper
how
do
you
introduce
the
sop
to
the
store
and
help
them
work
through
the
change
after
hearing
about
the
rollout
of
the
sop
which
happen
at
the
same
time
the
store
be
gear
up
for
the
holiday
season
and
at
the
same
time
that
marketing
have
introduce
a
special
promotion
in
the
store
which
be
labor
intensive
she
more
fully
understood
the
problem
think
about
it
if
this
be
a
cartoon
you
would
have
the
draw
but
no
animation
it
be
a
still
life
they
ca
not
see
how
to
fit
it
into
their
everyday
work
routine
change
behavior
be
one
of
the
hardest
thing
for
people
to
do
but
it
can
be
do
the
consultant
then
described
how
successfully
change
behavior
require
work
through
how
people
think
about
the
change
head
how
they
feel
about
the
change
heart
and
how
they
learn
to
do
thing
the
new
way
hand
and
she
explain
change
be
not
an
event
but
a
process
that
unfolds
over
time
first
people
have
to
come
to
grip
with
the
need
to
change
and
what
the
change
actually
mean
then
they
have
to
work
through
the
change
piece
by
piece
and
finally
they
have
to
guard
against
slide
back
to
the
old
way
to
make
the
change
stick
she
say
to
sustain
it
take
a
lot
of
skill
and
hard
work
for
a
company
such
as
best
buy
which
operate
in
such
a
freeform
and
back
of
the
envelope
manner
a
simple
framework
fit
the
consultant
word
have
the
ring
of
authority
about
what
it
take
to
implement
and
sustain
effective
change
the
map
she
described
would
guide
the
retail
executive
through
these
challenge
they
acknowledge
that
they
be
expert
in
many
thing
but
not
in
implement
effective
change
these
executive
be
experienced
and
confident
enough
to
partner
with
others
who
have
the
relevant
knowledge
and
experience
that
they
do
not
have
partner
with
people
who
specialized
in
change
people
behavior
make
sense
the
meeting
end
with
an
agreement
that
the
consultant
would
develop
a
proposal
for
implement
the
sop
in
a
way
that
would
lead
to
sustain
change
as
you
might
imagine
there
be
skepticism
about
the
consultant
be
they
able
to
push
us
beyond
our
own
resistance
and
blind
spot
ask
brad
anderson
best
buy
vice
chairman
of
the
board
and
chief
executive
officer
who
be
president
and
coo
at
the
time
acutely
aware
of
the
need
for
change
but
what
about
these
consultant
he
ask
the
retail
executive
be
they
tough
enough
to
withstand
everything
our
people
and
culture
will
throw
at
them
we
have
see
it
kill
off
other
outsider
before
one
of
the
executive
have
work
with
the
consultant
before
and
give
his
honest
opinion
this
will
be
the
big
challenge
they
have
ever
take
on
but
i
know
these
people
they
will
do
whatever
it
take
to
help
us
succeed
well
say
the
other
executive
what
be
our
alternative
none
of
the
other
option
look
viable
so
the
partnership
begin
one
of
the
retail
executive
be
a
field
test
veteran
of
best
buy
with
a
string
of
proven
success
in
the
midwest
region
where
the
company
begin
he
be
a
tough
skeptical
pragmatist
the
executive
for
the
other
half
of
the
retail
division
be
a
champion
of
many
controversial
idea
who
excel
in
tough
love
he
could
be
hard
on
people
who
do
not
perform
or
see
the
same
need
to
perform
that
he
do
but
he
be
willing
to
invest
in
develop
those
people
he
do
believe
in
or
who
prove
themselves
to
him
both

of

a

from
the
most
insightful
manager
give
a
flavor
of
the
best
buy
culture
at
that
time
we
believe
that
we
have
already
achieve
success
we
have
an
aura
of
invincibility
we
totally
disregard
how
you
get
result
how
you
get
there
in
fact
the
cowboy

the
hero
everyone
be
happy
to
work
within
his

silo
there
be
no
value
see
in
partner
we
have
a
superman
perspective
that
we
can
do
anything
in
twenty
minute
without
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
think
about
it
we
get

do
through
brute
force
push
thing
through
never
share
a
best
practice
with
another
store
or
district
you
need
to
win
on
your
own
and
not
through
collaboration
look
back
a
former
store
gm
described
the
culture
as
be
like
the
volume
on
a
stereo
if
it
be
turn
down
too
soft
you
ca
not
hear
it
and
if
it
be
turn
up
too
loud
it
blast
you
message
like
win
at
all
cost
drive
for
result
do
whatever
it
take
and
do
it
on
your
own
be
not
bad
but
the
volume
on
those
message
be
turn
up
way
too
high
part
of
the
culture
get
overuse
the
volume
control
be
out
of
whack
an
annoyed
manager
say
we
be
run
a
multibillion
dollar
business
like
it
be
a
music
store
in
minneapolis
and
there
be
a
corporate
v
retail
tension
each
side
felt
the
problem
lay
with
the
other
the
field
be
see
as
weak
because
it
could
not
implement
the
multiple
uncoordinated
often
conflict
initiative
but
because
the
corporate
department
do
not
have
to
coordinate
among
themselves
they
sent
out
directive
and
initiative
without
really
understand
the
impact
of
what
they
be
ask
for
here
be
an
example
the
marketing
department
elect
to
have
special
in
the
sunday
newspaper
insert
that
would
require
extensive
reconfiguration
of
display
in
the
store
this
seem
like
something
the
store
should
easily
be
able
to
implement
if
they
be
not
so
inept
meanwhile
the
labor
hour
guru
in
operation
have
analyze
the
staff
of
the
store
and
have
cut
back
on
the
labor
budget
so
the
store
manager
do
not
have
the
money
to
pay
people
to
reset
the
store
to
support
the
advertising
campaign
unless
they
paid
overtime
but
if
they
paid
overtime
they
would
be
criticize
for
go
over
their
budget
it
be
easy
to
blame
the
hectic
nature
of
store
operation
than
to
look
at
the
systemic
issue
as
the
store
and
the
field
start
get
their
act
together
their
improve
performance
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
the
corporate
department
to
become
more
efficient
and
to
coordinate
with
one
another
at
a
divisional
offsite
the
general
district
and
regional
manager
work
on
improve
themselves
in
a
number
of
skill
one
of
which
be
time
management
during
a
break
in
the
meeting
to
play
golf
one
of
the
gm
say
i
do
not
know
that
learn
time
management
be
go
to
help
me
or
any
of
us
gm
maybe
it
will
help
some
who
have
not
have
good
time
management
skill
in
the
past
but
i
have
and
i
think
that
i
still
do
i
think
it
be
out
of
our
hand
the
amount
of
information
we
get
from
corporate
headquarters
on
a
daily
and
weekly
basis
be
huge
i
be
pretty
efficient
and
i
do
think
that
pay
attention
to
that
communication
be
important
so
i
try
to
stay
up
with
it
but
i
simply
ca
not
it
be
impossible
the
gm
be
on
a
roll
now
our
department
just
wo
not
talk
to
each
other
they
seem
to
have
no
clue
they
think
they
have
a
great
idea
and
just
take
off
without
get
us
involve
and
it
bomb
out
here
in
the
field
because
we
be
just
not
prepared

put
it

in
logistics
and
loss
prevention
that
be
critical
to
this
new
sop

we
really
need
them
they
just
do
not
seem
to
realize
we
should
act
like
we
be

of
the
same

lurch
off
to

certainly
skeptical
of

everyone
be
also
enthusiastic
about

ready
to

the
sacrifice
of

and
lack
of
appreciation
sometimes
even
skepticism
and
rejection
from

up

there
be
lot
of

the

often
seem

broad

abstract
for

when

to
that
particular

of

it
be

because
you
developed
a

to

because
you
work

you
put

so
on

we

more
specifically
behavioral

this
approach
be
to
be
very
different
from

at

they
be
all

us
we
felt
like
we
be
in
a

and
we
ask
all

to

they
do
this
be
the
point
at

i
felt

be

come

that
have
overwhelmed
the

among
other
thing
the

would
consolidate
all

over
the
course
of

of
large
systemic
issue
affect
the

issue
originate
outside
of

function
and
would
have
to
consider
how
to
best
deal
with
these
issue
for
the
first

the

would
decide
to
not
address
these

unless
an
issue
impact
have
the
potential
to
be
catastrophic
and
to
stay
focus
on
get
retail
discipline
and
use
the
sop
after
the
first
year
the
cit
would
form
liaison
with
various
corporate
function
and
together
work
on
way
to
convey
how
the
store
could
be
or
be
affected
by
decision
and
direction
stem
from
these
function
the
manage
change
workshop
know
how
would
need
to
be
transfer
not
just
from
the
consultant
who
be
expert
in
human
behavior
to
the
cit
but
also
from
the
cit
to
the
people
in
the
field
for
the
organization
to
increase
its
synchronicity
and
its
flexibility
all
the
employee
would
need
to
know
more
about
how
change
affected
them
and
others
how
to
collaboratively
work
through
issue
and
how
to
learn
more
effectively
fortunately
the
consultant
have
already
developed
material
include
a
framework
and
a
workshop
on
manage
the
human
side
of
change
to
meet
the
challenge
of
transfer
change
know
how
throughout
the
company
the
consultant
would
tailor
the
change
management
workshop
for
best
buy
and
even
more
specifically
for
the
sop
implementation
the
workshop
contain
much
of
the
material
in
this
book
with
the
addition
of
role
play
exercise
and
example
take
from
real
life

that
occur
in
the

while
the
sop
be
be
implement
to
maximize
learn
appropriate
timing
be
important
the
cit
be
not
give
the
formal
training
on
how
to
manage
change
until
after
the
team
have
make
its
first
extend
foray
into
the
field
one
of
the
cit
member
remembers
that
the
timing
be
critical
i
thought
it
be
key
that
the
consultant
do
not
teach
us
change
implementation
change
management
right
away
instead
they
just
sent
us
out
to
do
a
baseline
then
once
we
have
real
example
from
our
own
experience
they
taught
us
about
the
head
heart
and
hand
use
actual
example
from
what
we
would
just
be
through
we
all
thought
that
we
have
the
answer
since
we
would
be
successful
gm
thing
start
to
click
and
the
rhythm
start
to
change
also
they
start
to
teach
us
about
facilitation
how
to
facilitate
a
meeting
i
saw
that
we
use
a
sequence
of
have
an
experience
from
which
to
draw
real
life
example
go
into
a
meeting
and
discuss
it
really
learn
the
how
to
and
then
apply
it
right
away
after
the
consultant
and
the
cit

taught
the

resonate
within

the

create
a

the

today
some

we

we

successfully
implement

a
majority
of

can
answer
question
about
the

correctly

we
all

learn
to
perform

at
time

to
refocus

raise
our

add
up

have
learn
to

a

synthesis

that

it
take
work
to

your
job
be
to
help
people
see
the
advantage
of
become
a
collective

you
need
to
guide
them
in
shape
common

way
of
work
together
that
every

can

have
try

tease
out
the
essence
of
the
platform
for
each
of
the

to
give
you
conceptually
the
why
and
benefit
at
the
next
level
of
implementation
this
should

you
in
your
effort
to
communicate
and
lead
your
team
through
change
at
this
point
we
know
that
some
of
you
could
write
these
list
so
feel
free
to
add
your
own
benefit
and
reason
as
you
discus
this
with
your
team

or
what

look
like
one
of
the
most

that
the

a
relearn
of
something
great
organizational

have
described
as
develop
a
share
vision
in
down
to

best

term
this
notion
would
be
translate
into
do
we
know
what
good
look
like
the
team
start
with
the
goal
of
implement
the
sop
so
that
it
would
be
use
consistently
in
every
store
every
day
that
sound
like
a
pretty
clear
goal
but
no
one
have
ever
witness
what
the
retail
store
would
look
and
feel
like
with
the
sop
fully
implement
it
have
not
happen
yet
so
people
in
line
position
in
management
position
and
on
the
cit
would
need
to
fill
in
the
picture
of
what
good
look
like
over
time
executive
sponsorship
the
retail
executive
knew
that
they
have
the
mandate
to
implement
the
sop
one
of
them
clearly
remembers
that
brad
anderson
then
best
buy
president
and
coo
give
his
support
but
make
it
clear
that
they
be
in
charge
his
hand
off
approach
would
prove
to
be
essential
the
cit
be
to
be
give
the
full
backing
of
the
three
retail
executive
initially
there
be
some
rough
spot
while
both
the
executive
and
the
team
be
learn
what
full
backing
really
meant
for
example
before
the
team
be
form
the
executive
give
their
word
that
for
a
full
year
the
cit
member
could
not
be
recruit
off
the
team
to
go
into
another
job
they
let
the
rest
of
retail
management
know
that
people
could
not
leave
the
team
during
the
first
year
that
they
should
not
even
try
to
lure
them
away
this
practice
of
move
people
around
and
promote
them
rapidly
without
determine
whether
the
individual
have
be
in
the
job
long
enough
to
become
competent
be
part
of
the
old
best
buy
culture
and
it
happen
frequently
in
spite
of
the
retail
executive
apparent
commitment
just
after
the
very
first
cit
meeting
the
only
one
of
the

who
have
be
a
district
manager
be
offer
another
dm
position
he
be
pull
from
the
team
two
of
the
executive
challenged
the
third
executive
who
have
sanction
this
move
and
then
all
three
of
them
reconfirm
their
commitment
to
leave
people
in
place
on
the
team
for
a
year
this
time
their
agreement
held
as
one
retail
executive
put
it
we
all
have
the
same

one
of
the

of

remember
the

this

the
time

actually
try
to
learn

this
period
of
resistance

essential

in
the
early
day
of
its
formation
politely
listen
to
the
discussion
about
change
scorecard
but
like
student
at
the
begin
of
the
semester
the
test
be
too
far
in
the
future
to
be
real
and
in
truth
they
have
only
a
hazy
understand
of
how
to
measure
these
squishy
concept
about
organizational

these

in
figure
out
what
must
go
on
inside
the

of
their
employee
and
let
be
candid
the
consultant
do
not
yet
know
exactly
what
would
go
on
these
scorecard

how
well
they
might
work
they
knew
only
that
those
scorecard

we
will
talk
much
more
about
scorecard
in
chapter
and
head

simple
but
powerful
as
we
have
say
change
always
require
energy
and
focus
nothing
change
without
sweat
and
emotion
we
assert
that
successful
change
require
overcome

challenge
and
obstacle
unique
to
each
of
the
three

to
achieve
last
result
as
the
cit
and
consultant
step
up
to
their

they
establish
a

of
tool
and
practice
to
ass
and
manage
the
obstacle
of
each
arena
in
follow
chapter
we
go
deeper
into
the
best
buy
experience
and
each
of
the
arena
and
stage
we
describe
the
critical
foundational
skill
necessary
to
master
the
challenge
and
obstacle
of
change
in
each
arena
you
have
to
think
it
to
lead
it
first
and
foremost
you
have
to
understand
and
believe
in
the
change
yourself
so
you
can
provide
a
living
example
of
it
day
to
day
people
learn
by
watch
what
you
do
as
a
manager
rather
than
listen
to
what
you
say
so
next
we
turn
to
the
head
arena
and
look
at
how
to
change
the
dominant
mind
set
of
an
organization
chapter
use
the

to

an
organization
first
change
mind
the
success
of
an
organization
rest
more
with
how
it
think
about
the
world
than
many
business
strategist
acknowledge
where
america
online
saw
a
mass
audience
ready
to
have
an
internet
portal
and

other
medium
company
saw
nerd
pc
and
a
hopelessly
tiny
market
similarly
woolworth
saw
the
retailing
world
as
small
town
main
street
and
familiar
customer
and
fail
to
change
its
think
as
the
retail
world
drove
past
main
street
on
its
way
to
mall
and
big
discount
store
to
change
an
organization
its
people
and
process
even
its
value
and
strategy
you
must
change
the
organization
mind
set
about
the
world
first
what
do
you
see
in
figure
a
man
face
or
a
woman
hold
a
baby
what
be
more
remarkable
than
the
fact
that
there
be
two
figure
be
that
your
first
mind
set
predominates
and
it
require
conscious
effort
to
keep
the
alternate
image
in
mind
this
be
the
power
of
mind
set
we
get
in
a
groove
and
sometimes
a
rut
in
the
way
we
see
our
world
our
habit
of
thought
how
we
perceive
and
interpret
a
situation
and
what
we
see
as
its
implication
be
automatic
it
be
difficult
to
be
aware
of
these
filter
without
something
jarring
our
perception
and
change
our
worldview
this
be
the
arena
of
the
head
how
we
think
about
our
business
model
and
our
image
of
the
organization
to
change
in
the
arena
of

to
alter
our

what
do
you
see
business
people
especially
retailer
be
often
hypercompetitive
in

the
hypercompetition
between
store
district

and

drove
people
to
succeed
the

either
you

or
you
be

either
or

go

although
the
true
competition
be
and

the
perception
be
that
the

people
be
ranked
against

every

when
someone

to

an

that

do
not

for
example
in

before
the

the
retail

that
everyone
would
consistently
hold
morning

these
meeting
be
meant
to
reinforce

to
give
people
feedback
they
would
at

the

meeting
we
nail
it
the
senior

then
spent
two

only

that
you
can
speak
to
her
in
way
that

then
you

each
of
these
arena
give
us
a
primary
challenge
the
key
objective
in
the
head
arena
be
to
help
people
realize
what
no
longer
work
with
the
old
way
of

and
what
must

to
what
the
change
be
to
the
new
mind
set
and
include
a
new

and
a
rationale
for
its
success
how
be
such
a
basic
part
of
us
as
our
mind

simply
tell
people
they
need
to
change
wo
not
accomplish
deep
result
to
change
mind
you
must
create
an
environment
in
which
people
ask
their
own
question
find
their
own
answer
and
make
their
own

saw
the
need

that
emphasize
consistency
discipline
and
all

what
everyone
underestimated

the

about

alone
the

of
the

the

gotten
they
be
often
frustrate
on
a
personal
level
with
their
internal

they
soon
realize
it
be
more
constructive
to
confront
the
old
mind
set
than
to
take
any
approach
that
could
be
interpret
as
a
personal
critique
they
need
solid
compelling

see
the

as

put

we

you
put

sometimes
can

by
the

executive
always
help
them
get

of
operating
manager
also
make
visit
to
competitor
and
even
retailer
from
other

sometimes
we
ask
rms
to
make
presentation
for
and
against
the

implementation
we
have
department
head
become

for
a
day
all
these
experience
prompt
new
think
and
create
enough
emotional
charge
to

lock
in
pattern
of

and
finally
scorecarding
the
use
of

question
and
answer
and
observation
about
behavior
can
also
help
evaluate
mind
set
in
our

scorecard
developed
for
best
buy
described
in
chapter
and
we
ask
store
manager
and
employee
to
describe
their
reason
for

various
process
and
procedure
when
an

can

only
that
she

by
define

people
in
their

i
be

to
sell
more
computer

show
me
how
that
would
work
melanie
thought
about
it
a
minute
then
say
i
have
get
a
proposal
for
you
let
run
an
experiment
and
do
three
thing
first
follow
the

guideline
to
the
letter
second
observe
what
happens
look
for
opportunity
to
coach
the
salesperson
on
make
the
most
of
zone
third
compare
the
result
to
time
when
you
be
not
use
zone
like
yesterday
both
melanie
and
the
manager
be
surprised
by
the
result
use
zone
and
coach
people
on
how
to
make
the
most
of
it
work
they
both
have
to
see
with
new
eye
that
the
sop
be
a
solution
not
just
another
task
at
hand
this
profound
shift
in
mind
set
be
evident
when
chris
one
of
the

broadcast
a
personal
revelation
the

be
the
way
you
get
all
the

it

another

it
be
the
way
to
manage
the
whole
process
to
get
the
result
we
need
i
would
be
think
of
it
as
another
plate
to
keep
spin
but
now
i
see
that
it
be
the
platform
that
all
the

human
behavior
emotion
in
its
various
guise
can
either
power
or
derail
change
one
reason
for
this
be
that
all
change
involves
loss
as
we
enter
a
change
we
move
out
of
our
familiar
comfort
zone
we
lose
some
of
our
sense
of
control
which
trigger
fear
and
anxiety
like
hunger
pang
on
an
empty
stomach
anxiety
be
the
companion
of
change
such
emotion
if
not
extreme
can
lead
to
constructive
rather
than
destructive
behavior
establish
successful
change
always
involves
help
participant
understand
and
cope
with
their
emotional
reaction
in
an
adaptive
manner
how
do
you
know
when
you
be
deal
with
an
emotional
reaction
to
change
sometimes
the
emotion
be
obvious
you
see
it
in
a
person
action
expression
or
voice
but
sometimes
it
be
disguise
as
apparently
rational
argument
whether
emotion
be
express
overtly
or
not
you
need
to
look
under
whatever
be
happen
and
ask
why
in
chapter
we
discuss
the
importance
of
a
clear
vision
and
a
strong
business
rationale
for
change
this
sense
of
direction
be
essential
but
it
lead
to
change
only
if
it
engages
the
emotion
that
can
power
such
a
change
those
who
create
the
sop

their
design
primarily
in
several
experimental
store
the
logic
of
the
sop
and
the
elegance
of
its
process
improvement
perhaps
be
thought
to
be
enough
to
ensure
their
implementation
if
you
look
at
an
organization
from
a
mechanistic
mind
set
you
might
assume
that
a
well
design
platform
will
put
the
piece
of
the
machine
or
store
or
company
together
flawlessly
this
viewpoint
do
not

the
complexity
of

the
messy
dicey
human
element
the
designer
of
the

appear

with

they
thought
should
be
faster
and
brighter
about
learn
and
apply
what
the

within
the
store
people
be
upset
and
unsure
about
the
change
effort
they
have
not
have
opportunity
to
express
and
work
through
their
feeling
and
they
do
not
see
any
payoff
in

some
thought
the
bar

they

in

its
unique

require
you
to
balance
patience
with
the
complexity
of
emotional
change
while
still
respond
with
the
urgency
need
to
accomplish
the
change
the
key
challenge
of
the
heart
arena
be
to
increase
the
readiness
of
individual
and
team
for
change
this
often
involves
overcome
resistance
in
the
pursuit
of
commitment
to
a
new
mind
set
a
vision
and
specific
behavior
of
implementation
to
accomplish
this
challenge
one
must
deal
with
the
central
question
in
everyone
mind
what
in
it
for
me
or
wiifm
the
challenge
can
be
visceral
as
tom
put
it
we
think
we
can
convert
the
mass
but
people
be
accept
us
like
the
pharisee
accepted
the
christian
readiness
for
change
every
organization
team
and
individual
be
ambivalent
about
change
there
be
almost
never
either
complete
openness
or
total
opposition
to
change
successful
change
involves
move
individual
and
team
into
the
more
ready
than
not
category
as
eminent
organizational
psychologist
henry
levinson
say
all
change
involves
loss
and
all
loss
require
mourn
even
positive
change
and
achievement
involve
loss
when
your
teenager
leaf
home
for
college
he
loses
some
of
the
close
parental
support
as
well
as
the
laundry
service
that
have
be
so
familiar
to
him
even
though
the
increase
freedom
and
self
direction
he
gain
may
far
outweigh
the
loss
in
the
corporate
world
change
mean
the
loss
of
familiar
and
comfortable
pattern
usually
successful
one
up
until
now
you
can
see
this
when
a
person
be
promote
to
a
managerial
position
for
the
first
time
or
when
the
restructuring
of
business
process
affect
the
role
and
responsibility
of
those
involve
resistance
to
change
occurs
when
you
perceive
your
loss
to
outweigh
your
gain
conversely
readiness

when
your

loss
be
uncomfortable
even

produce
and
the
motivation
be
to
avoid
them
a
key
dynamic
in
the
heart
arena
be
that
you
must
help
individual

for
most
people
gain

thus
they
feel
ambivalent
they
sit
on
the

they
be

even

an
organization
cannot

with
most
people
either
resist
or
watch
from
the
sideline
as
illustrate

on
the

right
where
a
large
proportion
of
people
be

note
that
even
in
a
change

organization
there
will
still
be
a
significant
number
of
people
either

we

the
slogan
name
it
and
frame
it
give
the
fear
a
name

then
look
at
it
from
different

realign

if

the

to
tell
you
why
he

then
you

you

you
when

employee
must

it
be
the

that

so
to

you
must
have

the

start
to

strain
the
team
have
create
a
faq

on
the

for
coach
and
training
purpose
the
faq
sheet
essentially
contain
the
answer
to
the
test
but
without
all
the
specific
as
every

know
if
you
get
your

on
an

of
the

you
can
score
well
by

rather
than

the

decide
not
to
share
the

outside
the

and
only
to
use
it
in
teach
and

one
of
the

charles
either
misunderstood

decide

the

he
give
the

to
his

and
not
surprisingly
the
people
in
that

begin
to
appear
very
knowledgeable
charles
insist
that
the

of
the

follow
his

charles
region
be
do
an
effective
job
of
communicate

support
the

but
the
dissemination
of
the

faq

cause
other

to
question
charles
result
at
a
cit
meeting
the

raise
the
issue
charles
challenged
the

this
should
be
okay
we
should
do
this
everywhere
if
we
do
not
hand
it
out
in
the
other
region
it
be
go
to
make
my

look
bad
but
say
the

we
as
a
team
agree
not
to
do
this
the
cit
member
be
shift
restlessly
in
their
chair
but
not
say
anything
charles
grow
angry
and
insist
that
the
consultant
and
the
team
capitulate
look
around
the
group
it
be
clear
that
the
other
cit
member
disagreed
with
him
the
consultant
say
just
look
at
your
team
member
they
all
stayed
with
our
agreement
what
message
would
it
send
them
if
we
be
to
make
it
okay
to
hand
out
the
faq
sheet
just
because
you
have
already
do
so
we
ca
not
do
it
and
we
wo
not
do
it
then
alex
spoke
up
the
only
credibility
we
have
in
the
company
come
from
our
integrity
as
individual
and
as
a
team
it
be
what
we
stand
on
as
cit
member
it
be
the
only
thing
we
have
to
keep
us
from
get
divide
and
pull
apart
we
have
to
stick
to
our
agreement
otherwise
we
be
no
different
from
the
culture
we
be
try
to
change
so
the
team
except
for
charles
stuck
with
its
original
practice
and
become
more
united
in
the
process
charles
continued
to
diverge
from
the
team
in
his
practice
cause
concern
that
the
organization
would
perceive
in
the

a
disconnect
between
the

and

eventually

the

the

thus
change

also
a

with
the
person
who
be
unwilling

to
the

that

when
the
organizational
momentum
have

if
he
have
a

if

it

here
be
the

let
take
a
simple
example
on
a
shopping
trip
you
see
a
child
throw
a
temper
tantrum
even
though
the
parent
be
try
to
suppress
the
wail
why
do
that
child
throw
a
temper
tantrum
because
the
child
parent
be
give
him
what
he
or
what
every
child
craves
attention
sometimes
the
parent
give
a
treat
on
top
of
that
and
the
tantrum
becomes
a
likely
feature
of
every
trip
to
the
store
behavioral
analysis
be
about
understand
what
encourages
or
discourages
behavior
you
can
imagine
the
power
of
this
approach
to
understand
why
employee
might
not

now
you
see
it
now
you
do
not
the
first
step
in

to
simply
watch
carefully

the

happen

so
simple
all
i
have
to
do

this

impression
i
spent
a
few
hour
in
the

and
what
i

be
rather
than

observation
i
spent
an
hour
in

of
the

carefully
tracked
the

first
before

the
reality
be
that
we
usually
do
not
change
deeply
until
we
absolutely
have
to
and
it
may

as
the

parallel
the

it
be
no
one
fault
but
it
be
everyone
responsibility
since
we
be
all
part
of
the
system
we
live
in
we
be
part
of
what
need
to
be
change
to
recognize
and
accept
that

of

the

as
part
of
the
system
your
behavior
will
be
caught
in
a
struggle
between
the
need
to
change
in
constructive
way
and
the
natural
inclination
to
preserve
the
status
quo
we
be
all
creature
of
habit
and
a
product

our
experience
our
habitual
behavior

not
something
that
we
consciously
do
to
inhibit

they
be
simply
part
of
our
current
or
previous
way

about
some
familiar
topic
of
dissension
that
keep
surface
with
your
spouse
or
other
family
member
have
you
ever
found
yourself
in
the

of
a
familiar
disagreement
with
the
other

you
have
say
before

that
you
know
what
pattern
the
discussion
will
follow
it
be
like
living
a
rerun
in
which
you
know
both
your
and
the
other
person
line
it
be
not
easy
to
recognize
these
pattern
of
behavior
when
they
start
and
it
be
even
more
difficult
to
try
to
replace
them
with
new
behavior
the
more
senior
you
be
in
an
organization
the
more
likely
it
be
that
you
be
unconsciously
follow
the
practice
and
mind
set
of
that
culture
and
since
sustain

require

you
must
change
as
challenge
as
this
will
be
it
be
possible
to
change
your
behavior
especially
if
you
can
get
honest
feedback
from
people
you
trust
and
if
you
practice
the
new

have
a
behavioral
expert
coach
you
through
the
process

in

by

after
the
second
round
of
scorecarding
some
of
us
have
become
aware
that
we
need
to
address
the
leadership
behavior
of
the
retail

work
out
a
plan
and
agree
on
it
melanie
met
with
one
of
them
and
i
met
with
the
other
this
be
the
big
turn
point
if
they
ignore
us
or
do
not
believe
us
we
could
see
that
the
change
effort
be
doom
melanie

i
be
tour

with
my

how
to
give
him
feedback
in
a
way
that
he
could
hear
it
early
on
i
would
told
him
to
focus
on
the
process
and
that
the
result
would
come
we
both
take
extreme
position
about
this
the
executive
remembers
i
read
the
book
of
new
store
procedure
but
i
do
not
understand
what
behavior
it
translate
into
or
that
i
need
to
model
the
new
behavior
melanie
try
a
different
approach
with
the
retail
executive
i
told
him
do
not
change
your
expectation
about
output
just
put
it
into
a
different
frame
ask
what
process
be
break
down
we
be
able
to
move
from
be
caught
up
in
punch
list
simplistic
result
only
orient
scorecard
and
focus
more
on
what
the
manager
and
leader
be
do
the
other
retail

agree
to
a
close
door
discussion
with
jason
jason

lead
up
to
our
attempt
to
effect
a

in
the
top

have
begin
teach
us
how
to

with
my
retail

here
be
a
re
creation
of
jason
close
door
session
jason
hesitate
and
then
begin
the
way
you
look
at
thing
and
the
way
you
tell
people
what
they
be
do
wrong
during
your
store
visit
be
undo
our
work
he
quickly
add
i
be
not
say
that
you
be
do
this
on
purpose
run
that
by
me
again
the
executive
reply
jason
say
well
last
week
when
i
be
with
you
the
first
thing
you
ask
each
person
on
the
floor
be
what
be
your
accessory
sale
today
the
executive
look
skeptical
yes
that
be
true
and
your
point
would
be
jason
reply
when
you
ask
people
thing
like
what
be
your
accessory
sale
today
you
be
direct
their
attention
to
isolated
activity
and
individual
result
instead
of
how
they
use
the
sop
as
a
system
that
allows
them
to
manage
process
to
get
all
kind
of
result
and
instead
of
think
in
term
of
a
complete
solution
for
the
customer
the
executive
frown
i
still
do
not
get
it
jason
explain
sell
accessory
be
just
part
of
the
salesperson
responsibility
it
fit
in
sometime
after
greet
the
customer
and
before
he
walk
out
the
door
how
about
ask
the
salesperson
to
describe
her
last
interaction
with
a
customer
ask
her
to
take
you
through
it
step
by
step
then
you
will
hear
the
overall
flow
of
how
she
do
or
do
not
connect
with
the
customer
you
can
get
a
lot
more
information
and
you
can
also
land
the
point
with
the
salesperson
that
the
sop
help
her
manage
her
overall
activity
and
help
her
to
achieve
each
particular
result
mmmm
the
retail
executive
say
okay
i
think
i
see
your
point
so
what
else
be
i
do
wrong
jason
answer
with
his
own
question
be
you
sure
you
be
up
for
this
if
i
can
dish
it
out
i
well
be
able
to
take
it
and
to
learn
from
it
the
executive
state
all
right
jason
continued
you
walk
in
and
pound
on
people
for
bad
shrink
lose
and
steal
product
and
poor
financial
result
you
put
people
on
the
spot
and
accuse
them
why
ca
not
you
do
this
you
say
get
it
fix
and
it
sound
like
a
threat
the
retail
executive
comment
i
be
just
hold
them
accountable
well
jason
told
him
that
be
the
way
we
define
the
word
accountable
around
here
a
lot
it
come
across
like
you
be
pound
on
them
we
have
have
to
operate
here
at
best
buy
with
a
lot
of
inadequate
and
broken
system
how
about
instead
of
point
the
finger
at
the
person
you
work
with
her
to
find
out
where
the
system
be
break
down
first
you
can
always
blame
them
later
there
be
plenty
of
that
go
around
think
about
it
jason
continued
you
could
be
ask
the
store
manager
question
like
what
could
this
be
link
to
what
other
problem
do
it
cause
and
your
rms
and
dm
be
do
the
same
thing
nobody
be
think
about
how
to
use
the
sop
to
tackle
the
underlie
cause
and
problem
in
that
store
or
region
the
executive
listen
he
be
quiet
for
a
long
time
look
out
the
window
beyond
his
desk
and
past
jason
into
the
parking
lot
and
the
gray
overcast
winter
sky
okay
he
say
finally
let
start
by
make
some
more
store
visit
together
i
think
i
be
teachable
in
public
forum
each
of
the
retail
executive
become
willing
to
role
model
his
learn
in
front
of
his
entire
leadership
team
this
forum
let
them
showcase
the
executive
listen
to
the
feedback
change
their
behavior
and
give
credit
to
the
cit
for
example
at
a
divisional
management
meeting
in
santa
barbara
one
of
the
executive
role
played
himself
absolutely
lay
into
a
store
manager
he
really
get
into
his
role
and
there
be
know
chuckle
in
the
audience
this
be
too
familiar
then
one
of
the
member
of
the
cit
call
a
halt
to
the
scene
he
ask
the
executive
what
effect
he
thought
he
be
have
on
the
store
manager
and
suggest
that
the
executive
proceed
in
a
different
way
they
replayed
the
scene
but
this
time
the
retail
executive
work
with
the
store
manager
to
investigate
where
the
problem
be
originate
and
what
to
do
about
it
they
conclude
by
talk
about
what
each
have
learn
from
the
process
and
how
they
felt
about
it
the
experience
of
see
the
executive
laugh
at
himself
and
acknowledge
how
he
need
to
change
his
own
behavior
to
be
more
effective
be
electrify
this
group
of
leader
saw
that
even
their
most
senior
leader
be
open
to
feedback
and
learn
as
one
cit
member
recall
we
all
begin
to
understand
what
change
be
really
about
before
we
expect
that
we
would
tell
people
what
to
do
and
they
would
do
it
one
of
the
other
retail
executive
remembers
this
time
also
when
i
ask
myself
what
be
the
major
turn
point
it
come
to
me
that
it
be
when
melanie
come
to
me
and
jason
go
to
the
other
retail
executive
with
feedback
about
how
our
leadership
behavior
be
derail
the
change
effort
and
how
we
need
to
change
too
a
member
of
the
cit
add
once
it
become
the
thing
to
do
and
the
executive
start
walk
the
talk
it
make
our
job
as
the
cit
so
much
easy
then
the
rms
finally
get
it
and
we
start
get
cascade
sponsorship
from
every
level
the
success
or
failure
of
the
sop
change
implementation
effort
turn
on
this
point
leader
start
acknowledge
that
they
need
to
change
too
for
the
change
effort
to
succeed
feedback
ask
for
it
and
you
might
get
it
why
be
feedback
necessary
as
someone
involve
in
or
responsible
for
change
your
organization
you
need
thoughtful
objective
feedback
from
the
people
you
work
with
to
accurately
gauge
the
impact
and
implication
of
your
leadership
behavior
often
though
these
people
may
be
reluctant
to
share
with
you
how
they
really
see
you
it
may
be
that
their
high
regard
for
you
cause
them
to
hold
back
or
they
may
be
afraid
of
repercussion
if
they
be
honest
or
they
may
simply
not
know
how
to
do
it
they
might
think
you
will
label
them
as
negative
when
they
be
actually
try
to
be
positive
and
constructive
the
leadership
paradox
be
that
the
more
you
could
benefit
from
feedback
the
less
likely
you
be
to
get
it
that
be
the
more
senior
your
position
the
great
the
impact
of
your
leadership
behavior
and
the
great
your
need
for
input
but
the
less
likely
that
people
will
offer
it
the
most
effective
leader
turn
this
paradox
upside
down
to
find
the
truth
they
ask
for
take
and
use
sincere
critical
feedback
on
their
style
behavior
and
impact
a
consistent
underlie
characteristic
of
highly
successful
leader
be
their
ability
to
manage
themselves
that
be
they
be
willing
to
look
at
and
change
when
necessary
their
own
mind
set
emotional
reaction
and
behavior
we
all
have
blind
spot
and
in
very
successful
people
these
blind
spot
often
be
the
flip
side
of
the
strength
that
have
gotten
them
where
they
be
and
have
contribute
to
their
success
for
example
in
best
buy
leader
be
use
to
take
care
of
a
problem
and
quickly
move
on
to
work
on
the
next
big
thing
this
attitude
and
behavior
enable
them
to
successfully
build
an
entrepreneurial
company
sometimes
though
they
could
miss
the
fact
that
a
problem
might
require
their
more
sustain
attention
and
effort
an
executive
from
another
function
be
recruiting
a
retail
executive
to
work
on
a
new
major
corporate
undertaking
that
would
require
substantial
time
and
commitment
to
take
on
this
new
duty
the
retail
executive
be
planning
to
stop
come
to
the
cit
executive
briefing
however
this
could
send
the
message
that
he
be
withdraw
his
support
for
the
sop

the
culture

pull
the
retail

to
move
on
to
something
new
and
excite
rather
than
sustain
something
already
in
progress
another

damn
it
you

into
our
usual
trap
we
move
from

if
you
back
out

and
the

the

do
you

this
be
not
a
trick
question
but
it
be
a
tough
one
to
answer
we
have
already

some
of
the
step
to
take
in

use
the
hand
to
make
change
real
but
we
will
reframe
them
here
for
your
use
the
first
step
be
to
ask
question
such
as
what
leadership

will
be
require
and
how
do
i
have
to

then

the
question
embed
in
those
broad
question
use
your
answer
to
the
above
question
how
do
you
evaluate
yourself
as
a
leader
of
change
and
as
an
effective
leader
in
the
change
organization
what
be
your
strength
and
area
for
improvement
as
a
change
leader
and
a
leader
in
the
new
order
how
would
others
evaluate
you
on
all
these
question
how
do
you
know
who
can
you
ask
that
will
give
you
an
honest
unbiased
answer
that
you
will
trust
what
be
your
organizational
relationship
with
this
person

you
ask
her
for
feedback
about
yourself

so

do
you

she
give
you

speculate
as
to
how
others
would

you
on
the

leadership
question
then
you
need
to
set
up
some
way
of
get
timely
honest
feedback
to
help
you
grow
and
change
who
do
you

even
then
in
a

here
if

the

a

therefore
go

with

do
the

then

that
when
they

into

and
have
evolve
the

realize
that
they
would
need
to
move
back
into
mode
of
understand
and
feel
when
the

be
not

especially
when
the

be
model
and
coached
by
people
direct
supervisor
but
still
be
not
take
hold
here
be
some
question
from
a
change
scorecard
use
in
the
first
several
month
of
a
change
implementation
these
question
focus
on
the
head
arena
understand
why
the
change
be
necessary
know
the
essence
of
the
change
well
enough
to
problem
solve
with
it
or
teach
it
to
someone
else
and
understand
what
it
take
to
lead
the
change
effort
in
your
opinion
what
be
the
purpose
of
the
standard
operating
platform
in
each
discipline
for
the
store
as
a
whole
what
benefit
have
result
in
the
store
from
implement
the
standard
operating
platform
as
people
start
to
come
to
term
with
the
change
in
the
head
and
heart
arena
they
still
need
to
learn
what
they
need
to
do
differently
and
how
to
do
it
fortunately
we
know
a
lot
about
what
it
take
to
unlearn
old
habit
and
learn
new
habit
and
develop
new
skill
even
though
many
technique
can
be
use
in
this
arena
change
behavior
be
never
easy
remember
for
people
to
learn
something
new
they
need
to
have
a
model
picture
or
example
of
the
new
behavior
they
need
opportunity
to
practice
the
new
behavior
and
get
feedback
on
their
progress
and
they
need
coach
and
encouragement
in
the
next
chapter
we
address
how
to
meet
these
requirement
for
learn
and
skill
development
and
what
that
implies
for
the
organization
process
and
culture
here
our
main
point
be
that
in
develop
item
for
the

in
use
it
wisely
the
raters
and
manager
need
to
rely
on
observe
behavior
include
verbal
behavior
to
observe
people
and
what
they
be
do
you
have
to
take
the
time
to
do
so
and
be
in
a
position
to
notice
observe
what
they
be
do
realize
and
promote
this
idea
be
just
one
of
the
many
lesson
the
organization
learn
and
embed
in
its
evolve

they

that
the

a

for
any

if
what

do
in

the

will
need
to
address
those

if
with
the

differ
function
require
specific

then
there

that

change
management
know
how
earlier
we
make
the
case
for
leader
who
be
involve
in
a
change
effort
at
any
level
become
knowledgeable
about
how
change
effect
people
in
the
organization
the
term
know
how
mean
more
than
simply
know
about
change
it
implies
that
the
person
have
the
capacity
to
take
effective
action
the
key
challenge
for
leader
then
be
how
well
do
they
understand
what
it
take
to
lead
and
manage
change
and
how
skilled
be
they
at
do
it
we
also
emphasize
that
become
a
skilled
successful
leader
of
change
mean
that
you
know
how
you
approach
and
work
through
change
and
how
it
have
the
potential
to
change
you
it
be

that
some
aspect
of
manage
change
will
be
the

regardless
of
the
type
of
organizational
change
be
implement
while
other
aspect
of
manage

be
likely
to
be
specific
to
the

of

implement
put
the

scorecard
to
more
work
measure
the
progress
of
the

effort
be
the
most
obvious
use
of
the

scorecard
when
we
stop
to
think
about
it
we

that

learn
when
we
learn
something

really
learn
it
it
change

when

we
often
learn
something
new
about
others
our
world

ourselves
the

can
be
use
for
feedback

in
the
follow
way
feedback
be
people
get
feedback
about
how
they
be
do
to
teach

coach
people

for
them
to
learn
effectively
you
need

give
them

learn
be
people
learn
be
the
new
learn
be
share
and
celebrate
people
need
feedback
as
well
as
opportunity
to
practice
and
forum
in
which
to
practice
with
feedback
in
order
to
learn
the

the

upon

we
spot

analyze

that

block
the
progress

when

set
out

much
emphasis
on

early
in

since
it

we
also
speak
to
the

we
see
how

scorecarding
be
by
nature
evaluative

judgmental
and
thus
it
tends
to
put
people
on
the

when

be
defensive
they
shut
down
their

the

as
well
as

we
learn
to
be
very
careful
about

the

in

remind
that
the
active
listen
skill
described
in
chapter
foundational
skill
be
essential
in
the
communication
and
scorecarding
process
and
they
continually
ask
themselves
what
message
be
we
send
as
we
have
mention
in
earlier
chapter
before
the
cit
be
form
a
certification
audit
be
initially
use
to
ass
the
store
compliance
with
the
sop
at
that
time
the
district
manager
claimed
that
all
store
have
pass
the
audit
with
a
score
of
percent
or
well
in
reality
however
not
much
have
change
in
term
of
how
the
store
be
operating
the
need
to
comply
have
be
hammer
into
the
retail
organization
with
an
authoritative
because
i
say
so
attitude
however
when
you
try
to
drive
change
into
an
organization
you
run
over
a
lot
of
people
best
buy
have
comply
on
the
surface
without
do
what
it
would
take
to
actually
change
cultivate
be
well
than
drive
change
as
we
join
the
effort
to
implement
the
sop
we
aim
for
a
mindset
of
cultivate
rather
than
drive
change
we
ask
ourselves
and
the
cit
how
do
you
grow
people
awareness
of
the
need
to
change
their
willingness
and
the
skill
they
need
to
be
successful
we
pretested
our
message
on
key
critic
in
the
field
ask
them
how
they
interpret
the
message
and
we
look
for
misinterpretation
that
would
require
us
to
use
a
different
approach
we
knew
that
best
buy
people
be
good
at
figure
out
how
to
beat
scorecard
so
we
need
to
find
a
way
to
make
the
scorecard
valid
and
to
reflect
real
change
one
of
the
cit
member
suggest
that
we
make
unannounced
visit
to
the
store
to
apply
the
scorecard
his
reason
be
that
if
store
manager
be
told
in
advance
when
cit
member
would
be
visit
they
would
put
only
their
best
and
brightest
people
on
duty
at
that
time
then
we
would
not
be
likely
to
get
an
accurate
read
on
the
use
of
the
sop
in
the
store
however
if
the
cit
be
simultaneously
try
to
establish
a
work
relationship
with
the
store
management
base
on
trust
and
respect
what
message
would
surprise
scorecarding
visit
send
what
chance
do
the
cit
have
of
promote
an
atmosphere
of
collaboration
and
mutual
problem
solve
if
they
be
see
as
the
sop
cop
little
to
none
operating
in
this
way
would
pit
the
cit
against
the
store
management
in
an
adversarial
relationship
so
the
team
decide
to
publish
an
advance
schedule
of
their
store
visit
and
build
in
the
necessary
safeguard
against
artificially
inflate
score
in
preparation
for
the
first
round
of
scorecarding
the
retail
executive
and
the
cit
spent
significant
time
refining
their
approach
they
spent
long
hour
hash
out
exact
agreement
on
what
language
they
would
use
as
a
team
to

they

one
another
if
a

sound
suspicious
punitive

they

we

the

the
most

to

to

some
of
the

of

in

you
have

then
paint
the
picture
of
what
they
will
look

then
the

saw
the

the

very

we

apply
the

it
require

when

ask

when
you
have

again
ask

you

without

here
be
an

people
in

be
just
competitive
and
not

to

them
in
a
meaningful
way
that
they
have

goal
responsibility

especially
share
opportunity
why
because
their
management
do
not

in

of
the
big
picture
they
do
not
see
how

so

follow
the

what
might
be
some
side
effect
that
could
happen

we
take
this
action
and
what
kind
of

might
happen
later
on
because
of
this
action
this

it

after
take
a

hour
to

the

realize
this
be
both
bad
and
good
the
good
news
be
that
this
be
the

that

bonus
would
take
a
hit
in
this
first
round
of

to
establish
the
baseline
we
saw
some
big
difference
between
some
region
in

our
question
be
be
this
difference
in
composite
score
due
to
actual
performance
difference
in
the
region
or
be
it
due
to
difference
in
how
the
cit
member
be
rating
performance
we
have
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
in
the
region
that
have
score
noticeably
different
from
store
in
other
similar
region
we
do
another
round
of
scorecarding
on
a
representative
sample
of
store
this
time
we
either
sent
two
cit
member
together
or
a
cit
member
from
another
region
to
repeat
the
scorecarding
the
conclusion
we
reach
be
that
the
cit
member
who
do
the
original
scorecarding
have
rat
a
number
of
store
in
their

high
than
they
should
have
be

we
hear
a

we
skeptically

that
the
actual

be
probably

rather
than

skepticism
in
you
we
will
present
the
quantitative
analysis
without
the
superlative
our
main
point
in
one
sentence
be
that
the
sop
change
implementation
be
sustain
over
four
year
as
measure
by
the
change
scorecard
and

standard
business
metric
e
g

profitability

turnover
and
so
on
now
for
some
detail
we
conduct
quantitative
analysis
statistical
correlation
over
the
nine
wave
of
scorecarding
which
span
four
year
we
focus
on
three
important
retail
business
result
the
profitability
of
each
store
the
turnover
of
employee
in
each
store
and
the
company
stock
price
the
store
metric
be
a
focus
because
the
sop
be
specifically
introduce
to
increase
profitability
in
the
store
what
should
we
expect
store
that
be
operating
well
presumably
be
more
satisfy
to
employee
and
provide
a
well

the

the

that

confirm

with

different

a
member
of
the
consult
team
come
to
the
lead
consultant
with
these
question
what
do
i
do
now
how
do
i
we
distinguish
myself
ourselves
from
the
member
of
the
cit
we
do
most
of
the
same
thing
when
these
kind
of
question
be
ask
you
know
there
have
be
a
successful
transfer
of
know
how
into
the
organization
what
do
it
take
to
sustain
change
the
short
answer
to
the
question
what
do
it
take
to
sustain
change
be
that
the
people
of
the
organization
must
not
only
change
how
they
get
their
job
do
but
also
must
work
through
in
an
integrate
way
how
they
think
and
feel
about
the
change
change
how
you
think
feel
and
behave
about
change
be
in
itself
part
of
what
require
to
successfully
make
the
change
and
the
organization
must
keep
the
movement
move
through
all
the
stage
of
change
in
every
part
of
the
system
the
head
one
of
the
key
change
that
we
often
need
to
make
in
our
think
about
change
be
realize
that
change
be
almost
never
an
event
it
be
a
process
change
usually
do
not
have
a
recognizable
end
if
you
expect
it
to
be
neatly
wrap
up
like
a
package
with
a
bow
on
it
you
will
be
unpleasantly
surprised
when
it
unwraps
itself
change
be
not
over
until
it
be
over
which
be
usually
when
the
next
big
change
come
along
that
affect
the
same
system
as
the
current
change
some
people
tend
to
get
stuck
in
the
head
arena
usually
people
who
be
more
academically
and
analytically
inclined
and
others
shortchange
it
in
business
organization
after
the
business
rationale
have
be
establish
in
the
upper
level
of
management
the
importance
of
communicate
the
why
of
the
change
and
exactly
what
the
change
consists
of
in
language
and
example
relevant
to
people
at
each
level
of
the
organization
be
often
overlook
on
the
other
hand
thoroughly
work
through
the
arena
of
the
head
for
all
level
of
the
organization
can
reap
the
follow
benefit
a
vision
share
by
a
wide
variety
of
people
in
the
organization
an
understand
of
the
implication
of
the
change
for
each
person
in
each
job
role
development
of
basic
think
skill
such
as
analytical
and
system
think
skill
increase
ability
of
many
people
to
transfer
what
they
have
learn
to
other
type
of
situation
and
change
the
minimum
downside
of
not
really
attend
to
the
head
arena
be
that
the
individual
and
the
organization
will
not
reap
the
benefit
list
above
the
maximum
downside
of
fail
to
work
through
the
head
arena
be
that
the
change
effort
will
fail
to
sustain
progress
in
the
head
arena
it
be
essential
that
new
people
come
into
the
organization
be
also
expose
to
the
why
and
whats
of
how
we
do
thing
around
here
and
that
issue
associate
with
the
change
be
continually
address
as
they
emerge
how
have
attention
to
the

fare
at
best
buy
as
one
svp
explains
best
buy
have
always
have
a
bias
for

now
we
have
learn
to
focus
our
bias
on
understand
problem
solve
and
learn
for
example
before
the
sop
the
regional
staff
meeting
be
straight
downloads
now
the
staff
meeting
be
forum
for
the
business
leader
and
all
the
team
member
to
work
together
to
understand
and
solve
problem
we
put
our
head
together
to
learn
what
in
the
customer
best
interest
another
svp
add
a
difference
in
the
culture
now
be
that
we
look
at

end
to
end
in
their
full
context
from
start
to
finish
we
document

we
have
group
learn
in
which
we
include
different
point
of
view
the
heart
as
we
have
discover
unless
the
emotion
be
engage
in
a
change
effort
and
engage
in
a
positive
way
deep
change
cannot
happen
downplay
the
role
of
the
heart
in
organizational
change
have
be
the
rule
but
since
many
of
us
derive
a
good
deal
of
our
identity
and
sense
of
self
worth
from
our
work
it
be
not
surprising
that
change
at
work
and
in
our
relationship
to
it
carry
tremendous
emotion
some
change
seem
to
beckon
to
us
and
others
seem
to
loom
over
us
like
impend
doom
in
either
case
our
emotional
reaction
hold
a
charge
traditionally
emotion
have
be
an
off
limit
topic
in
the
workplace
although
a
limited
set
of
emotion
may
be
sanction
for
example
show
enthusiasm
or
mild
frustration
for
the
most
part
show
an
emotional
reaction
in
the
workplace
be
deem
unprofessional
and
or
inappropriate
there
be
good
reason
for
this
not
all
emotion
be
appropriate
to
express
in
a
work
set
however
it
be
important
to
set
up
forum
in
which
it
be
safe
for
people
to
express
emotion
related
to
the
change
effort
most
of
us
be
uncomfortable
deal
with
emotion
both
our
own
and
others
to
some
extent
we
be
uncomfortable
because
we
be
unskilled
at
deal
with
emotional
expression
often
we
squelch
them
then
the
emotion
go
underground
and
show
up
in
distort
and
sometimes
destructive
way
to
successfully
implement
change
and
especially
to
sustain
it
will
require
that
you
learn
some
of
the
technique
described
in
this
book
for
work
in
the
heart
arena
and
apply
them
the
tremendous
upside
of
attend
to
the
arena
of
the
heart
be
that
you
can
release
energy
into
make
the
change
succeed
the
make
or
break
nature
of
a
turnaround
effort
brings
with
it
a
special
intensity
it
may
not
be
possible
to
continue
to
work
at
that
level
of
intensity
when
everything
be
go
well
but
the
fact
that
such
intensity
exists
at
time
show
the
power
of
the
heart
of
engage
the
emotion
in
a
way
that
carry
true
meaning
for
people
on
the
other
hand
organization
be
dynamic
always
change
and
we
hope
learn
in
the
process
the
need
for
continue
feedback
to
fuel
the
learn
and

do
not
go
away
even
in
the
good

no

about
it
work
through

in
the

of

the
challenge

it

not

minimize
a
regional

his
team

we
do
well
on

we
have
a
harder
time
with
the
heart
it
take
more
time

be
more
challenge

it

how
you
create

we

a

about

how
to

the
barrier
to

that
we
simply

have
different
often
unexpressed

about
what
the

what

it
possible
to
generalize
the

described
in
this
book
to
other
type
of
organization
if
we
keep
in
mind
that
the

be

the
answer
be
yes
the

consist
of
the

as
well
as

after
the

sop
change

but
on
small
scale
how
to
tailor
the
approach
depends
on
the
culture
of
the
organization
the
type
of
business
and
the
type
of
change
involve

and
counsel
we
certainly
cannot
claim
to
have
invent
it
we
can
claim
to
have
apply
it
in
a
different
way
than
we
would
see
it
apply
before
would
it

with
a
very
different
kind
of

in
merger
acquisition
with
other
client
but
to
consider
apply
the
framework
even
more
generally
we
can
ask
what
element
of
the
framework
and
program
be
universal
a
change
scorecard
might
not
be
appropriate
to

type
of

it
might

or
the

might

the
need
for
a
quantifiable
mean
of

progress
of
the
change
effort
and
the
need
for
feedback
to

your
progress

universal
these

intrinsic
aspect
of

in
any

that
