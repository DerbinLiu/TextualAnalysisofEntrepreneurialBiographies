introduction
how
this
book
come
to
be
in
the
early
summer
of
i
get
a
phone
call
from
steve
job
he
have
be
scattershot
friendly
to
me
over
the
year
with
occasional
burst
of
intensity
especially
when
he
be
launch
a
new
product
that
he
want
on
the
cover
of
time
or
feature
on
cnn
place
where
i
d
work
but
now
that
i
be
no
longer
at
either
of
those
place
i
hadn
t
heard
from
him
much
we
talk
a
bit
about
the
aspen
institute
which
i
have
recently
join
and
i
invite
him
to
speak
at
our
summer
campus
in
colorado
he
d
be
happy
to
come
he
say
but
not
to
be
onstage
he
want
instead
to
take
a
walk
so
that
we
could
talk
that
seem
a
bit
odd
i
didn
t
yet
know
that
take
a
long
walk
be
his
prefer
way
to
have
a
serious
conversation
it
turn
out
that
he
want
me
to
write
a
biography
of
him
i
have
recently
publish
one
on
benjamin
franklin
and
be
write
one
about
albert
einstein
and
my
initial
reaction
be
to
wonder
half
jokingly
whether
he
saw
himself
as
the
natural
successor
in
that
sequence
because
i
assume
that
he
be
still
in
the
middle
of
an
oscillate
career
that
have
many
more
ups
and
down
left
i
demur
not
now
i
say
maybe
in
a
decade
or
two
when
you
retire
i
have
know
him
since
when
he
come
to
manhattan
to
have
lunch
with
time
s
editor
and
extol
his
new
macintosh
he
be
petulant
even
then
attack
a
time
correspondent
for
have
wound
him
with
a
story
that
be
too
reveal
but
talk
to
him
afterward
i
found
myself
rather
captivate
as
so
many
others
have
be
over
the
year
by
his
engage
intensity
we
stayed
in
touch
even
after
he
be
oust
from
apple
when
he
have
something
to
pitch
such
as
a
next
computer
or
pixar
movie
the
beam
of
his
charm
would
suddenly
refocus
on
me
and
he
would
take
me
to
a
sushi
restaurant
in
low
manhattan
to
tell
me
that
whatever
he
be
tout
be
the
best
thing
he
have
ever
produce
i
like
him
when
he
be
restore
to
the
throne
at
apple
we
put
him
on
the
cover
of
time
and
soon
thereafter
he
begin
offering
me
his
idea
for
a
series
we
be
do
on
the
most
influential
people
of
the
century
he
have
launch
his
think
different
campaign
feature
iconic
photo
of
some
of
the
same
people
we
be
consider
and
he
found
the
endeavor
of
assess
historic
influence
fascinate
after
i
have
deflect
his
suggestion
that
i
write
a
biography
of
him
i
heard
from
him
every
now
and
then
at
one
point
i
email
to
ask
if
it
be
true
as
my
daughter
have
told
me
that
the
apple
logo
be
an
homage
to
alan
turing
the
british
computer
pioneer
who
broke
the
german
wartime
code
and
then
commit
suicide
by
biting
into
a
cyanide
lace
apple
he
reply
that
he
wish
he
have
thought
of
that
but
hadn
t
that
start
an
exchange
about
the
early
history
of
apple
and
i
found
myself
gathering
string
on
the
subject
just
in
case
i
ever
decide
to
do
such
a
book
when
my
einstein
biography
come
out
he
come
to
a
book
event
in
palo
alto
and
pull
me
aside
to
suggest
again
that
he
would
make
a
good
subject
his
persistence
baffle
me
he
be
know
to
guard
his
privacy
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
he
d
ever
read
any
of
my
book
maybe
someday
i
continued
to
say
but
in
his
wife
laurene
powell
say
bluntly
if
you
re
ever
go
to
do
a
book
on
steve
you
d
well
do
it
now
he
have
just
take
a
second
medical
leave
i
confess
to
her
that
when
he
have
first
raise
the
idea
i
hadn
t
know
he
be
sick
almost
nobody
knew
she
say
he
have
call
me
right
before
he
be
go
to
be
operate
on
for
cancer
and
he
be
still
keep
it
a
secret
she
explain
i
decide
then
to
write
this
book
job
surprised
me
by
readily
acknowledge
that
he
would
have
no
control
over
it
or
even
the
right
to
see
it
in
advance
it
s
your
book
he
say
i
won
t
even
read
it
but
later
that
fall
he
seem
to
have
second
thought
about
cooperate
and
though
i
didn
t
know
it
be
hit
by
another
round
of
cancer
complication
he
stop
return
my
call
and
i
put
the
project
aside
for
a
while
then
unexpectedly
he
phone
me
late
on
the
afternoon
of
new
year
s
eve
he
be
at
home
in
palo
alto
with
only
his
sister
the
writer
mona
simpson
his
wife
and
their
three
child
have
take
a
quick
trip
to
go
skiing
but
he
be
not
healthy
enough
to
join
them
he
be
in
a
reflective
mood
and
we
talk
for
more
than
an
hour
he
begin
by
recall
that
he
have
want
to
build
a
frequency
counter
when
he
be
twelve
and
he
be
able
to
look
up
bill
hewlett
the
founder
of
hp
in
the
phone
book
and
call
him
to
get
part
job
say
that
the
past
twelve
year
of
his
life
since
his
return
to
apple
have
be
his
most
productive
in
term
of
create
new
product
but
his
more
important
goal
he
say
be
to
do
what
hewlett
and
his
friend
david
packard
have
do
which
be
create
a
company
that
be
so
imbue
with
innovative
creativity
that
it
would
outlive
them
i
always
thought
of
myself
as
a
humanity
person
as
a
kid
but
i
like
electronics
he
say
then
i
read
something
that
one
of
my
hero
edwin
land
of
polaroid
say
about
the
importance
of
people
who
could
stand
at
the
intersection
of
humanity
and
science
and
i
decide
that
s
what
i
want
to
do
it
be
as
if
he
be
suggest
theme
for
his
biography
and
in
this
instance
at
least
the
theme
turn
out
to
be
valid
the
creativity
that
can
occur
when
a
feel
for
both
the
humanity
and
the
science
combine
in
one
strong
personality
be
the
topic
that
most
interested
me
in
my
biography
of
franklin
and
einstein
and
i
believe
that
it
will
be
a
key
to
create
innovative
economy
in
the
twenty
first
century
i
ask
job
why
he
want
me
to
be
the
one
to
write
his
biography
i
think
you
re
good
at
get
people
to
talk
he
reply
that
be
an
unexpected
answer
i
knew
that
i
would
have
to
interview
score
of
people
he
have
fire
abuse
abandon
or
otherwise
infuriate
and
i
fear
he
would
not
be
comfortable
with
my
get
them
to
talk
and
indeed
he
do
turn
out
to
be
skittish
when
word
trickle
back
to
him
of
people
that
i
be
interview
but
after
a
couple
of
month
he
begin
encourage
people
to
talk
to
me
even
foe
and
former
girlfriend
nor
do
he
try
to
put
anything
off
limit
i
ve
do
a
lot
of
thing
i
m
not
proud
of
such
as
get
my
girlfriend
pregnant
when
i
be
twenty
three
and
the
way
i
handle
that
he
say
but
i
don
t
have
any
skeleton
in
my
closet
that
can
t
be
allow
out
he
didn
t
seek
any
control
over
what
i
write
or
even
ask
to
read
it
in
advance
his
only
involvement
come
when
my
publisher
be
choose
the
cover
art
when
he
saw
an
early
version
of
a
propose
cover
treatment
he
disliked
it
so
much
that
he
ask
to
have
input
in
design
a
new
version
i
be
both
amuse
and
willing
so
i
readily
assent
i
end
up
have
more
than
forty
interview
and
conversation
with
him
some
be
formal
one
in
his
palo
alto
living
room
others
be
do
during
long
walk
and
drive
or
by
telephone
during
my
two
year
of
visit
he
become
increasingly
intimate
and
reveal
though
at
time
i
witness
what
his
veteran
colleague
at
apple
use
to
call
his
reality
distortion
field
sometimes
it
be
the
inadvertent
misfire
of
memory
cell
that
happens
to
us
all
at
other
time
he
be
spin
his
own
version
of
reality
both
to
me
and
to
himself
to
check
and
flesh
out
his
story
i
interviewed
more
than
a
hundred
friend
relative
competitor
adversary
and
colleague
his
wife
also
do
not
request
any
restriction
or
control
nor
do
she
ask
to
see
in
advance
what
i
would
publish
in
fact
she
strongly
encourage
me
to
be
honest
about
his
failing
as
well
as
his
strength
she
be
one
of
the
smartest
and
most
ground
people
i
have
ever
met
there
be
part
of
his
life
and
personality
that
be
extremely
messy
and
that
s
the
truth
she
told
me
early
on
you
shouldn
t
whitewash
it
he
s
good
at
spin
but
he
also
have
a
remarkable
story
and
i
d
like
to
see
that
it
s
all
told
truthfully
i
leave
it
to
the
reader
to
ass
whether
i
have
succeed
in
this
mission
i
m
sure
there
be
player
in
this
drama
who
will
remember
some
of
the
event
differently
or
think
that
i
sometimes
get
trap
in
job
s
distortion
field
as
happen
when
i
write
a
book
about
henry
kissinger
which
in
some
way
be
good
preparation
for
this
project
i
found
that
people
have
such
strong
positive
and
negative
emotion
about
job
that
the
rashomon
effect
be
often
evident
but
i
ve
do
the
best
i
can
to
balance
conflict
account
fairly
and
be
transparent
about
the
source
i
use
this
be
a
book
about
the
roller
coaster
life
and
searingly
intense
personality
of
a
creative
entrepreneur
whose
passion
for
perfection
and
ferocious
drive
revolutionize
six
industry
personal
computer
animate
movie
music
phone
tablet
compute
and
digital
publishing
you
might
even
add
a
seventh
retail
store
which
job
do
not
quite
revolutionize
but
do
reimagine
in
addition
he
open
the
way
for
a
new
market
for
digital
content
base
on
apps
rather
than
just
website
along
the
way
he
produce
not
only
transform
product
but
also
on
his
second
try
a
last
company
endow
with
his
dna
that
be
fill
with
creative
designer
and
daredevil
engineer
who
could
carry
forward
his
vision
in
august
right
before
he
step
down
as
ceo
the
enterprise
he
start
in
his
parent
garage
become
the
world
s
most
valuable
company
this
be
also
i
hope
a
book
about
innovation
at
a
time
when
the
united
state
be
seek
way
to
sustain
its
innovative
edge
and
when
society
around
the
world
be
try
to
build
creative
digital
age
economy
job
stand
as
the
ultimate
icon
of
inventiveness
imagination
and
sustain
innovation
he
knew
that
the
best
way
to
create
value
in
the
twenty
first
century
be
to
connect
creativity
with
technology
so
he
built
a
company
where
leap
of
the
imagination
be
combine
with
remarkable
feat
of
engineering
he
and
his
colleague
at
apple
be
able
to
think
differently
they
developed
not
merely
modest
product
advance
base
on
focus
group
but
whole
new
device
and
service
that
consumer
do
not
yet
know
they
need
he
be
not
a
model
bos
or
human
be
tidily
package
for
emulation
driven
by
demon
he
could
drive
those
around
him
to
fury
and
despair
but
his
personality
and
passion
and
product
be
all
interrelate
just
as
apple
s
hardware
and
software
tend
to
be
as
if
part
of
an
integrate
system
his
tale
be
thus
both
instructive
and
cautionary
fill
with
lesson
about
innovation
character
leadership
and
value

thus
it
be
no
surprise
that
he
threaten
to
cut

off
completely
when
as
a
graduate
student
at

at
one
point
pretty
much
control
the
price
of
wheat
in
the
region
his
mother
he
later
say
be
a
traditional
muslim
woman
who
be
a
conservative
obedient
housewife
like
the
schieble
family
the
jandalis
put
a
premium
on
education
abdulfattah
be
sent
to
a
jesuit
boarding
school
even
though
he
be
muslim
and
he
get
an
undergraduate
degree
at
the
american
university
in
beirut
before
enter
the
university
of

to
pursue
a
doctoral
degree
in

in
the
summer
of
joanne
go
with
abdulfattah
to
syria
they
spent
two
month
in
homs
where
she
learn
from
his
family
to
cook
syrian
dish
when
they
return
to
wisconsin
she
discover
that
she
be
pregnant
they
be
both
twenty
three
but
they
decide
not
to
get
married
her
father
be
die
at
the
time
and
he
have
threaten
to
disown
her
if
she
wed
abdulfattah
nor
be
abortion
an
easy
option
in
a
small
catholic
community
so
in
early
joanne
travel
to
san
francisco
where
she
be
take
into
the
care
of
a
kindly
doctor
who
shelter
unwed
mother
deliver
their
baby
and
quietly
arrange
close
adoption
joanne
have
one
requirement
her
child
must
be
adopt
by
college
graduate
so
the
doctor
arrange
for
the
baby
to
be
place
with
a
lawyer
and
his
wife
but
when
a
boy
be
born
on
february
the
designate
couple
decide
that
they
want
a
girl
and
back
out
thus
it
be
that
the
boy
become
the
son
not
of
a
lawyer
but
of
a
high
school
dropout
with
a
passion
for
mechanic
and
his
salt
of
the
earth
wife
who
be
work
as
a
bookkeeper
paul
and
clara
name
their
new
baby
steven
paul
job
when
joanne
found
out
that
her
baby
have
be
place
with
a
couple
who
have
not
even
graduate
from
high
school
she
refuse
to
sign
the
adoption
paper
the
standoff
last
week
even
after
the
baby
have
settle
into
the
job
household
eventually
joanne
relent
with
the
stipulation
that
the
couple
promise
indeed
sign
a
pledge
to
fund
a
saving
account
to
pay
for
the
boy
s
college
education
there
be
another
reason
that
joanne
be
balky
about
signing
the
adoption
paper
her
father
be
about
to
die
and
she
plan
to
marry
jandali
soon
after
she
held
out
hope
she
would
later
tell
family
member
sometimes
tear
up
at
the
memory
that
once
they
be
married
she
could
get
their
baby
boy
back
arthur
schieble
die
in
august
after
the
adoption
be
finalize
just
after
christmas
that
year
joanne
and
abdulfattah
be
married
in
st
philip
the
apostle
catholic
church
in
green
bay
he
get
his
phd
in
international
politics
the
next
year
and
then
they
have
another
child
a
girl
name
mona
after
she
and
jandali
divorce
in
joanne
embark
on
a
dreamy
and
peripatetic
life
that
her
daughter
who
grow
up
to
become
the
acclaim
novelist
mona
simpson
would
capture
in
her
book
anywhere
but
here
because
steve
s
adoption
have
be
close
it
would
be
twenty
year
before
they
would
all
find
each
other
steve
job
knew
from
an
early
age
that
he
be
adopt
my
parent
be
very
open
with
me
about
that
he
recall
he
have
a
vivid
memory
of
sit
on
the
lawn
of
his
house
when
he
be
six
or
seven
year
old
tell
the
girl
who
live
across
the
street
so
do
that
mean
your
real
parent
didn
t
want
you
the
girl
ask
lightning
bolt
go
off
in
my
head
accord
to
job
i
remember
run
into
the
house
cry
and
my
parent
say
no
you
have
to
understand
they
be
very
serious
and
look
me
straight
in
the
eye
they
say
we
specifically
picked
you
out
both
of
my
parent
say
that
and
repeat
it
slowly
for
me
and
they
put
an
emphasis
on
every
word
in
that
sentence
abandon
chosen
special
those
concept
become
part
of
who
job
be
and
how
he
regard
himself
his
closest
friend
think
that
the
knowledge
that
he
be
give
up
at
birth
left
some
scar
i
think
his
desire
for
complete
control
of
whatever
he
make
derives
directly
from
his
personality
and
the
fact
that
he
be
abandon
at
birth
say
one
longtime
colleague
del
yocam
he
want
to
control
his
environment
and
he
see
the
product
as
an
extension
of
himself
greg
calhoun
who
become
close
to
job
right
after
college
saw
another
effect
steve
talk
to
me
a
lot
about
be
abandon
and
the
pain
that
cause
he
say
it
make
him
independent
he
follow
the
beat
of
a
different
drummer
and
that
come
from
be
in
a
different
world
than
he
be
born
into
later
in
life
when
he
be
the
same
age
his
biological
father
have
be
when
he
abandon
him
job
would
father
and
abandon
a
child
of
his
own
he
eventually
take
responsibility
for
her
chrisann
brennan
the
mother
of
that
child
say
that
be
put
up
for
adoption
left
job
full
of
broken
glass
and
it
help
to
explain
some
of
his
behavior
he
who
be
abandon
be
an
abandoner
she
say
andy
hertzfeld
who
work
with
job
at
apple
in
the
early
s
be
among
the
few
who
remain
close
to
both
brennan
and
job
the
key
question
about
steve
be
why
he
can
t
control
himself
at
time
from
be
so
reflexively
cruel
and
harmful
to
some
people
he
say
that
go
back
to
be
abandon
at
birth
the
real
underlie
problem
be
the
theme
of
abandonment
in
steve
s
life
job
dismiss
this
there
s
some
notion
that
because
i
be
abandon
i
work
very
hard
so
i
could
do
well
and
make
my
parent
wish
they
have
me
back
or
some
such
nonsense
but
that
s
ridiculous
he
insist
know
i
be
adopt
may
have
make
me
feel
more
independent
but
i
have
never
felt
abandon
i
ve
always
felt
special
my
parent
make
me
feel
special
he
would
later
bristle
whenever
anyone
refer
to
paul
and
clara
job
as
his
adoptive
parent
or
imply
that
they
be
not
his
real
parent
they
be
my
parent
he
say
when
speak
about
his
biological
parent
on
the
other
hand
he
be
curt
they
be
my
sperm
and
egg
bank
that
s
not
harsh
it
s
just
the
way
it
be
a
sperm
bank
thing
nothing
more
silicon
valley
the
childhood
that
paul
and
clara
job
create
for
their
new
son
be
in
many
way
a
stereotype
of
the
late
s
when
steve
be
two
they
adopt
a
girl
they
name
patty
and
three
year
later
they
move
to
a
tract
house
in
the
suburb
the
finance
company
where
paul
work
as
a
repo
man
cit
have
transfer
him
down
to
its
palo
alto
office
but
he
could
not
afford
to
live
there
so
they
land
in
a
subdivision
in
mountain
view
a
less
expensive
town
just
to
the
south
there
paul
try
to
pas
along
his
love
of
mechanic
and
car
steve
this
be
your
workbench
now
he
say
as
he
marked
off
a
section
of
the
table
in
their
garage
job
remember
be
impressed
by
his
father
s
focus
on
craftsmanship
i
thought
my
dad
s
sense
of
design
be
pretty
good
he
say
because
he
knew
how
to
build
anything
if
we
need
a
cabinet
he
would
build
it
when
he
built
our
fence
he
give
me
a
hammer
so
i
could
work
with
him
fifty
year
later
the
fence
still
surround
the
back
and
side
yard
of
the
house
in
mountain
view
as
job
show
it
off
to
me
he
caress
the
stockade
panel
and
recall
a
lesson
that

with
steve
tag
along
i
figure
i
could
get
him
nail
down

ability

he
really
wasn

interested
in
get
his
hand
dirty
paul
later
recall
he
never
really
care

thing
i
wasn

to
electronics
my
dad
do
not
have
a

understand
of

but
he
d
encounter
it
a
lot
in
automobile
and
other
thing
he
would
fix
he
show
me
the
rudiment
of

and
i
get
very
interested
in
that
even
more
interest
be
the

he
wasn

he
seem
to
be
make
a
fortune
so
my

hard
i
remember
he
take
these
night
class
pass
the
license
test
and
get
into
real
estate
then
the
bottom
fell
out
of
the
market
as
a
result
the
family
found
itself
financially
strap
for
a
year
or
so
while
steve
be

one
day
his

teacher
ask
him
what
be
it
you
don
t
understand
about
the
universe
job
reply
i
don
t
understand
why
all
of
a
sudden
my
dad
be
so
broke
he
be
proud
that
his
father
never
adopt
a
servile
attitude
or
slick
style
that
may
have
make
him
a
well
salesman
you
have
to
suck
up
to
people
to
sell
real
estate
and
he
wasn
t
good
at
that
and
it
wasn
t
in
his
nature
i
admire
him
for
that
paul
job
go
back
to
be
a
mechanic
his
father
be
calm
and
gentle
trait
that
his
son
later
praise
more
than
emulate
he
be
also
resolute
job
described
one
example
nearby
be
an
engineer
who
be
work
at
westinghouse
he
be
a
single
guy
beatnik
type
he
have
a
girlfriend
she
would
babysit
me
sometimes
both
my
parent
work
so
i
would
come
here
right
after
school
for
a
couple
of
hour
he
would
get
drunk
and
hit
her
a
couple
of
time
she
come
over
one
night
scar
out
of
her
wit
and
he
come
over
drunk
and
my
dad
stood
him
down
say
she
s
here
but
you
re
not
come
in
he
stood
right
there
we
like
to
think
everything
be
idyllic
in
the
s
but
this
guy
be
one
of
those
engineer
who
have
mess
up
life
what
make
the
neighborhood
different
from
the
thousand
of
other
spindly
tree
subdivision
across
america
be
that
even
the
ne
er
do
well
tend
to
be
engineer
when
we
move
here
there
be
apricot

plum
orchard
on
all
of
these
corner
job
recall
but
it
be
begin
to
boom
because
of
military
investment
he
soak
up
the
history
of
the

and
developed
a
yearn
to
play
his
own
role
edwin

told
him
about

he

i
fell
totally
in

with

you
have
all
these
military
company
on
the
cut
edge
he
recall
it
be
mysterious
and
high
tech
and
make
living
here
very
excite
in
the
wake
of
the
defense
industry
there
arose
a
boom
economy
base
on
technology
its
root
stretch
back
to
when
david
packard
and
his
new
wife
move
into
a
house
in
palo
alto
that
have
a
shed
where
his
friend
bill
hewlett
be
soon
ensconce
the
house
have
a
garage
an
appendage
that
would
prove
both
useful
and
iconic
in
the
valley
in
which
they
tinker
around
until
they
have
their
first

fortunately
there
be
a
place
nearby
for
entrepreneur
who
have
outgrown
their
garage
in
a
move
that
would
help
transform
the
area
into
the
cradle
of
the
tech
revolution
stanford
university

terman
create
a
seven
hundred
acre
industrial
park
on

that
could
commercialize
the

associate
where
clara
job
work
terman
come
up
with
this
great
idea
that
do
more
than
anything
to
cause
the
tech
industry
to
grow
up
here
job
say
by
the
time
job
be
ten

nine

be
the

where
every

seek
financial
stability
want
to
work
the
most
important
technology
for
the
region
s
growth
be
of
course
the
semiconductor
william
shockley
who
have
be
one
of
the
inventor
of
the
transistor
at
bell
lab
in
new
jersey
move
out
to
mountain
view
and
in
start
a
company
to
build
transistor
use
silicon
rather
than
the
more
expensive
germanium
that
be
then
commonly
use
but
shockley
become
increasingly
erratic
and
abandon
his
silicon
transistor
project
which
lead
eight
of
his
engineer
most
notably
robert
noyce
and
gordon
moore
to
break
away
to
form
fairchild

that
company
grow
to
twelve
thousand

it
fragment
in
when
noyce
lose
a
power
struggle
to
become
ceo
he
take
gordon
moore
and
found
a
company
that
they
call
integrate
electronics
corporation
which
they
soon
smartly
abbreviate
to
intel
their
third
employee

andrew

who
later
would
grow
the
company
by
shift
its
focus
from
memory
chip
to

within
a

fifty

the
exponential
growth
of
this

correlate
with
the
phenomenon
famously
discover
by
moore
who
in
drew
a
graph
of
the
speed
of
integrate
circuit
base
on
the
number
of
transistor
that
could
be
place
on
a

and
show
that
it
double
about
every
two
year
a
trajectory
that
could
be
expect
to
continue
this
be
reaffirm
in
when
intel
be
able
to
etch
a
complete
central

held
generally
true
to
this

job
say
that
make
me
want

be
a
part
of
it
like
most
kid
he
become
infuse
with
the

ups
around
him
most
of
the

do
really
neat
stuff
like
photovoltaics
and
battery
and
radar
job
recall
i
grow
up
in
awe
of
that
stuff
and
ask
people
about
it
the
most
important
of
these
neighbor
larry
lang
live
seven
door
away
he
be
my
model
of
what
an
hp
engineer
be
suppose
to
be
a
big
ham
radio
operator
hard
core
electronics
guy
job
recall
he
would
bring
me
stuff
to
play
with
as
we
walk
up
to
lang
s
old
house
job
point
to
the
driveway
he
take
a
carbon
microphone
and
a
battery
and
a
speaker
and
he
put
it
on
this
driveway
he
have
me
talk
into
the
carbon
mike
and
it
amplify
out
of
the
speaker
job
have
be
taught
by
his
father
that
microphone
always
require
an
electronic
amplifier
so
i
race
home
and
i
told
my
dad
that
he
be
wrong
no
it
need
an
amplifier
his
father
assure
him
when
steve
protest
otherwise
his
father
say
he
be
crazy
it
can
t
work
without
an
amplifier
there
s
some
trick
i
kept
say
no
to
my
dad
tell
him
he
have
to
see
it
and
finally
he
actually
walk
down
with
me
and
saw
it
and
he
say

i

those
in
business
marketing
and
sale
i
remember
him
tell
me
that
engineering
be
the
high
level
of
importance
you
could
reach
in
the
world
steve
wozniak
later
recall
it
take
society
to
a
new
level
one
of
steve
wozniak
s
first
memory
be
go
to
his
father
s
workplace
on
a
weekend
and
be
show
electronic
part
with
his
dad
put
them
on
a
table
with
me
so
i
get
to
play
with
them
he
watch
with
fascination
as
his
father
try
to
get
a
waveform
line
on
a
video
screen
to
stay
flat
so
he
could
show
that
one
of
his
circuit
design
be
work
properly
i
could
see
that
whatever
my
dad
be
do
it
be
important
and
good
woz
as
he
be
know
even
then
would
ask
about
the
resistor
and
transistor
lie
around
the
house
and
his
father
would
pull
out
a
blackboard
to
illustrate
what
they
do
he
would
explain
what
a
resistor
be
by
go
all
the
way
back
to
atom
and
electron
he
explain
how
resistor
work
when
i
be
in
second
grade
not
by
equation
but
by
have
me
picture
it
woz
s
father
taught
him
something
else
that
become
ingrain
in
his
childlike
socially
awkward
personality
never
lie
my
dad
believe
in
honesty
extreme
honesty
that
s
the
big
thing
he
taught
me
i
never
lie
even
to
this
day
the
only
partial
exception
be
in
the
service
of
a
good
practical
joke
in
addition
he
imbue
his
son
with
an
aversion
to
extreme
ambition
which
set
woz
apart
from
job
at
an
apple
product
launch
event
in
forty
year
after
they
met
woz
reflect
on
their
difference
my
father
told
me
you
always
want
to
be
in
the
middle
he
say
i
didn
t
want
to
be
up
with
the
high
level
people
like
steve
my
dad
be
an
engineer
and
that
s
what
i
want
to
be
i
be
way
too
shy
ever
to
be
a
business
leader
like
steve
by
fourth
grade
wozniak
become
as
he
put
it
one
of
the
electronics
kid
he
have
an
easy
time
make
eye
contact
with
a
transistor
than
with
a
girl
and
he
developed
the
chunky
and
stoop
look
of
a
guy
who
spends
most
of
his
time
hunch
over
circuit
board
at
the
same
age
when
job
be
puzzle
over
a
carbon
microphone
that
his
dad
couldn
t
explain
wozniak
be
use
transistor
to
build
an
intercom
system
feature
amplifier
relay
light
and
buzzer
that
connect
the
kid
bedroom
of
six
house
in
the
neighborhood
and
at
an
age
when
job
be
building
heathkits
wozniak
be
assemble
a
transmitter
and
receiver
from
hallicrafters
the
most
sophisticated
radio
available
woz
spent
a
lot
of
time
at
home
reading
his
father
s
electronics
journal
and
he
become
enthral
by
story
about
new
computer
such
as
the
powerful
eniac
because
boolean
algebra
come
naturally
to
him
he
marvel
at
how
simple
rather
than
complex
the
computer
be
in
eighth
grade
he
built
a
calculator
that
include
one
hundred
transistor
two
hundred
diode
and
two
hundred
resistor
on
ten
circuit
board
it
won
top
prize
in
a
local
contest
run
by
the
air
force
even
though
the
competitor
include
student
through
twelfth
grade
woz
become
more
of
a
loner
when
the
boy
his
age
begin
go
out
with
girl
and
party
endeavor
that
he
found
far
more
complex
than
design
circuit
where
before
i
be
popular
and
rid
bike
and
everything
suddenly
i
be
socially
shut
out
he
recall
it
seem
like
nobody
spoke
to
me
for
the
long
time
he
found
an
outlet
by
play
juvenile
prank
in
twelfth
grade
he
built
an
electronic
metronome
one
of
those
tick
tick
tick
device
that
keep
time
in
music
class
and
realize
it
sound
like
a
bomb
so
he
take
the
label
off
some
big
battery
taped
them
together
and
put
it
in
a
school
locker
he
rig
it
to
start
tick
faster
when
the
locker
open
later
that
day
he
get
call
to
the
principal
s
office
he
thought
it
be
because
he
have
won
yet
again
the
school
s
top
math
prize
instead
he
be
confront
by
the
police
the
principal
have
be
summon
when
the
device
be
found
bravely
ran
onto
the
football
field
clutch
it
to
his
chest
and
pull
the
wire
off
woz
try
and
fail
to
suppress
his
laughter
he
actually
get
sent
to
the
juvenile
detention
center
where
he
spent
the
night
it
be
a
memorable
experience
he
taught
the
other
prisoner
how
to
disconnect
the
wire
lead
to
the
ceiling
fan
and
connect
them
to
the
bar
so
people
get
shock
when
touch
them
get
shock
be
a
badge
of
honor
for
woz
he
pride
himself
on
be
a
hardware
engineer
which
meant
that
random
shock
be
routine
he
once
devise
a
roulette
game
where
four
people
put
their
thumb
in
a
slot
when
the
ball
land
one
would
get
shock
hardware
guy
will
play
this
game
but
software
guy
be
too
chicken
he
note
during
his
senior
year
he
get
a
part
time
job
at
sylvania
and
have
the
chance
to
work
on
a
computer
for
the
first
time
he
learn
fortran
from
a
book
and
read
the
manual
for
most
of
the
system
of
the
day
start
with
the
digital
equipment
pdp
then
he
study
the
spec
for
the
late
microchip
and
try
to
redesign
the
computer
use
these
newer
part
the
challenge
he
set
himself
be
to
replicate
the
design
use
the
few
component
possible
each
night
he
would
try
to
improve
his
draw
from
the
night
before
by
the
end
of
his
senior
year
he
have
become
a
master
i
be
now
design
computer
with
half
the
number
of
chip
the
actual
company
have
in
their
own
design
but
only
on
paper
he
never
told
his
friend
after
all
most
seventeen
year
old
be
get
their
kick
in
other
way
on
thanksgiving
weekend
of
his
senior
year
wozniak
visit
the
university
of
colorado
it
be
close
for
the
holiday
but
he
found
an
engineering
student
who
take
him
on
a
tour
of
the
lab
he
beg
his
father
to
let
him
go
there
even
though
the
out
of
state
tuition
be
more
than
the
family
could
easily
afford
they
struck
a
deal
he
would
be
allow
to
go
for
one
year
but
then
he
would
transfer
to
de
anza
community
college
back
home
after
arrive
at
colorado
in
the
fall
of
he
spent
so
much
time
play
prank
such
as
produce
ream
of
printout
say
fuck
nixon
that
he
fail
a
couple
of
his
course
and
be
put
on
probation
in
addition
he
create
a
program
to
calculate
fibonacci
number
that
burn
up
so
much
computer
time
the
university
threaten
to
bill
him
for
the
cost
so
he
readily
live
up
to
his
bargain
with
his
parent
and
transfer
to
de
anza
after
a
pleasant
year
at
de
anza
wozniak
take
time
off
to
make
some
money
he
found
work
at
a
company
that
make
computer
for
the
california
motor
vehicle
department
and
a
coworker
make
him
a
wonderful
offer
he
would
provide
some
spare
chip
so
wozniak
could
make
one
of
the
computer
he
have
be
sketch
on
paper
wozniak
decide
to
use
as
few
chip
as
possible
both
as
a
personal
challenge
and
because
he
do
not
want
to
take
advantage
of
his
colleague
s
largesse
much
of
the
work
be
do
in
the
garage
of
a
friend
just
around
the
corner
bill
fernandez
who
be
still
at
homestead
high
to
lubricate
their
effort
they
drank
large

rid
their
bike
to
the
sunnyvale
safeway
to
return
the
bottle
collect
the
deposit
and
buy
more
that
s
how
we
start
refer
to
it
as
the
cream
soda
computer
wozniak
recall
it
be
basically
a
calculator
capable
of
multiply
number
enter
by
a
set
of
switch
and
display
the
result
in
binary
code
with
little
light
when
it
be
finish
fernandez
told
wozniak
there
be
someone
at
homestead
high
he
should
meet
his
name
be
steve
he
like
to
do
prank
like
you
do
and
he
s
also
into
building
electronics
like
you
be
it
may
have
be
the
most
significant
meeting
in
a
silicon
valley
garage
since
hewlett
go
into
packard
s
thirty
two
year
earlier
steve
and
i
just
sat
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
bill
s
house
for
the
long
time
just
share
story
mostly
about
prank
we
d
pull
and
also
what
kind
of
electronic
design
we
d
do
wozniak
recall
we
have
so
much
in
common
typically
it
be
really
hard
for
me
to
explain
to
people
what
kind
of
design
stuff
i
work
on
but
steve
get
it
right
away
and
i
like
him
he
be
kind
of
skinny
and
wiry
and
full
of
energy
job
be
also
impressed
woz
be
the
first
person
i
d
met
who
knew
more
electronics
than
i
do
he
once
say
stretch
his
own
expertise
i
like
him
right
away
i
be
a
little
more
mature
than
my
year
and
he
be
a
little
less
mature
than
his
so
it
even
out
woz
be
very
bright
but
emotionally
he
be
my
age
in
addition
to
their
interest
in
computer
they
share
a
passion
for
music
it
be
an
incredible
time
for
music
job
recall
it
be
like
living
at
a
time
when
beethoven
and
mozart
be
alive
really
people
will
look
back
on
it
that
way
and
woz
and
i
be
deeply
into
it
in
particular
wozniak

it
to
a
room
where
a
group
of
people
be
watch
tv
such
as
in
a
dorm
and
secretly
press
the
button
so
that
the
screen
would
get
fuzzy
with
static
when
someone
get
up
and
whack
the
set
wozniak
would
let
go
of
the
button
and
the
picture
would
clear
up
once
he
have
the
unsuspecting
viewer
hop
up
and
down
at
his
will
he
would
make
thing
harder
he
would
keep
the
picture
fuzzy
until
someone
touch
the
antenna
eventually
he
would
make
people
think
they
have
to
hold
the
antenna
while
stand
on
one
foot
or
touch
the
top
of
the
set
year
later
at
a
keynote
presentation
where
he
be
have
his
own
trouble
get
a
video
to
work
job
broke
from
his
script
and
recount
the
fun
they
have
with
the
device
woz
would
have
it
in
his
pocket
and
we
d
go
into
a
dorm
where
a
bunch
of
folk
would
be
like
watch
star
trek
and
he
d
screw
up
the
tv
and
someone
would
go
up
to
fix
it
and
just
as
they
have
the
foot
off
the
ground
he
would
turn
it
back
on
and
as
they
put
their
foot
back
on
the
ground
he
d
screw
it
up
again
contort
himself
into
a
pretzel
onstage
job
conclude
to
great
laughter
and
within
five
minute
he
would
have
someone
like
this
the
blue
box
the
ultimate
combination
of
prank
and
electronics
and
the
escapade
that
help
to
create
apple
be
launch
one
sunday
afternoon
when
wozniak
read
an
article
in
esquire
that
his
mother
have
left
for
him
on
the
kitchen
table
it
be
september
and
he
be
about
to
drive
off
the
next
day
to
berkeley
his
third
college
the
story
ron
rosenbaum
s
secret
of
the
little
blue
box
described
how
hacker
and
phone
phreakers
have
found
way
to
make
long
distance
call
for
free
by
replicate
the
tone
that
rout
signal
on
the
at
t
network
halfway
through
the
article
i
have
to
call
my
best
friend
steve
job
and
read
part
of
this
long
article
to
him
wozniak
recall
he
knew
that
job
then
begin
his
senior
year
be
one
of
the
few
people
who
would
share
his
excitement
a
hero
of
the
piece
be
john
draper
a
hacker
know
as
captain
crunch
because
he
have
discover
that
the
sound
emit
by
the
toy
whistle
that
come
with
the
breakfast
cereal
be
the
same
hertz
tone
use
by
the
phone
network
s
call
rout
switch
it
could
fool
the
system
into
allow
a
long
distance
call
to
go
through
without
extra
charge
the
article
reveal
that
other
tone
that
serve
to
route
call
could
be
found
in
an
issue
of
the
bell
system
technical
journal
which
at
t
immediately
begin
ask
library
to
pull
from
their
shelf
as
soon
as
job
get
the
call
from
wozniak
that
sunday
afternoon
he
knew
they
would
have
to
get
their
hand
on
the
technical
journal
right
away
woz
picked
me
up
a
few
minute
later
and
we
go
to
the
library
at
slac
the
stanford
linear
accelerator
center
to
see
if
we
could
find
it
job
recount
it
be
sunday
and
the
library
be
close
but
they
knew
how
to
get
in
through
a
door
that
be
rarely
lock
i
remember
that
we
be
furiously
dig
through
the
stack
and
it
be
woz
who
finally
found
the
journal
with
all
the
frequency
it
be
like
holy
shit
and
we
open
it
and
there
it
be
we
kept
say
to
ourselves
it
s
real
holy
shit
it
s
real
it
be
all
laid
out
the
tone
the
frequency
wozniak
go
to
sunnyvale
electronics
before
it
close
that
even
and
bought
the
part
to
make
an
analog
tone
generator
job
have
built
a
frequency
counter
when
he
be
part
of
the
hp
explorer
club
and
they
use
it
to
calibrate
the
desire
tone
with
a
dial
they
could
replicate
and
tape
record
the
sound
specify
in
the
article
by
midnight
they
be
ready
to
test
it
unfortunately
the
oscillator
they
use
be
not
quite
stable
enough
to
replicate
the
right
chirp
to
fool
the
phone
company
we
could
see
the
instability
use
steve
s
frequency
counter
recall
wozniak
and
we
just
couldn
t
make
it
work
i
have
to
leave
for
berkeley
the
next
morning
so
we
decide
i
would
work
on
building
a
digital
version
once
i
get
there
no
one
have
ever
create
a
digital
version
of
a
blue
box
but
woz
be
make
for
the
challenge
use
diode
and
transistor
from
radio
shack
and
with
the
help
of
a
music
student
in
his
dorm
who
have
perfect
pitch
he
get
it
built
before
thanksgiving
i
have
never
design
a
circuit
i
be
prouder
of
he
say
i
still
think
it
be
incredible
one
night
wozniak
drove
down
from
berkeley
to
job
s
house
to
try
it
they
attempt
to
call
wozniak
s
uncle
in
los
angeles
but
they
get
a
wrong
number
it
didn
t
matter
their
device
have
work
hi
we
re
call
you
for
free
we
re
call
you
for
free
wozniak
shout
the
person
on
the
other
end
be
confuse
and
annoyed
job
chime
in
we
re
call
from
california
from
california
with
a
blue
box
this
probably
baffle
the
man
even
more
since
he
be
also
in
california
at
first
the
blue
box
be
use
for
fun
and
prank
the
most
dare
of
these
be
when
they
call
the
vatican
and
wozniak
pretend
to
be
henry
kissinger
want
to
speak
to
the
pope
ve
be
at
de
summit
meeting
in
moscow
and
ve
need
to
talk
to
de
pope
woz
intone
he
be
told
that
it
be
a
m
and
the
pope
be
sleep
when
he
call
back
he
get
a
bishop
who
be
suppose
to
serve
as
the
translator
but
they
never
actually
get
the
pope
on
the
line
they
realize
that
woz
wasn
t
henry
kissinger
job
recall
we
be
at
a
public
phone
booth
it
be
then
that
they
reach
an
important
milestone
one
that
would
establish
a
pattern
in
their
partnership
job
come
up
with
the
idea
that
the
blue
box
could
be
more
than
merely
a
hobby
they
could
build
and
sell
them
i
get
together
the
rest
of
the
component
like
the
case
and
power
supply
and
keypad
and
figure
out
how
we
could
price
it
job
say
foreshadow
role
he
would
play
when
they
found
apple
the
finish
product
be
about
the
size
of
two
deck
of
play
card
the
part
cost
about
and
job
decide
they
should
sell
it
for
follow
the
lead
of
other
phone
phreaks
such
as
captain
crunch
they
give
themselves
handle
wozniak
become
berkeley
blue
job
be
oaf
tobark
they
take
the
device
to
college
dorm
and
give
demonstration
by
attach
it
to
a
phone
and
speaker
while
the
potential
customer
watch
they
would
call
the
ritz
in
london
or
a
dial
a
joke
service
in
australia
we
make
a
hundred
or
so
blue
box
and
sell
almost
all
of
them
job
recall
the
fun
and
profit
come
to
an
end
at
a
sunnyvale
pizza
parlor
job
and
wozniak
be
about
to
drive
to
berkeley
with
a
blue
box
they
have
just
finish
make
job
need
money
and
be
eager
to
sell
so
he
pitch
the
device
to
some
guy
at
the
next
table
they
be
interested
so
job
go
to
a
phone
booth
and
demonstrate
it
with
a
call
to
chicago
the
prospect
say
they
have
to
go
to
their
car
for
money
so
we
walk
over
to
the
car
woz
and
me
and
i
ve
get
the
blue
box
in
my
hand
and
the
guy
get
in
reach
under
the
seat
and
he
pull
out
a
gun
job
recount
he
have
never
be
that
close
to
a
gun
and
he
be
terrify
so
he
s
point
the
gun
right
at
my
stomach
and
he
say
hand
it
over
brother
my
mind
race
there
be
the
car
door
here
and
i
thought
maybe
i
could
slam
it
on
his
leg
and
we
could
run
but
there
be
this
high
probability
that
he
would
shoot
me
so
i
slowly
hand
it
to
him
very
carefully
it
be
a
weird
sort
of
robbery
the
guy
who
take
the
blue
box
actually
give
job
a
phone
number
and
say
he
would
try
to
pay
for
it
if
it
work
when
job
later
call
the
number
the
guy
say
he
couldn
t
figure
out
how
to
use
it
so
job
in
his
felicitous
way
convince
the
guy
to
meet
him
and
wozniak
at
a
public
place
but
they
end
up
decide
not
to
have
another
encounter
with
the
gunman
even
on
the
off
chance
they
could
get
their
the
partnership
pave
the
way
for
what
would
be
a
big
adventure
together
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
the
blue
box
there
wouldn
t
have
be
an
apple
job
later
reflect
i
m
sure
of
that
woz
and
i
learn
how
to
work
together
and
we
gain
the
confidence
that
we
could
solve
technical
problem
and
actually
put
something
into
production
they
have
create
a
device
with
a
little
circuit
board
that
could
control
billion
of
dollar
worth
of
infrastructure
you
cannot
believe
how
much
confidence
that
give
us
woz
come
to
the
same
conclusion
it
be
probably
a
bad
idea
sell
them
but
it
give
us
a
taste
of
what
we
could
do
with
my
engineering
skill
and
his
vision
the
blue
box
adventure
establish
a
template
for
a
partnership
that
would
soon
be
born
wozniak
would
be
the
gentle
wizard
come
up
with
a
neat
invention
that
he
would
have
be
happy
just
to
give
away
and
job
would
figure
out
how
to
make
it
user
friendly
put
it
together
in
a
package
market
it
and
make
a
few
buck

by
staccato
burst
of
fast
talk

odd
mix
of
intensity
and
aloofness
combine
with
his
shoulder

to
seek

out
he
be
entrance
by
the
apparent
intensity
of

s
conviction
that
a
state
of
enlightenment
truly
exist
and
could

fascinate
as

later
told
a
reporter
the
thing
that
struck
me
be
his
intensity
whatever
he
be
interested
in
he
would
generally
carry
to
an
irrational
extreme
job
have
hone
his
trick
of
use
stare
and
silence
to
master
other
people
one
of
his
number
be
to
stare
at
the
person
he
be
talk
to
he
would
stare
into
their
fuck
eyeball
ask
some
question
and
would
want
a
response
without
the
other
person
avert
their
eye
accord
to
kottke
some
of
job
s
personality
trait
include
a
few
that
last
throughout
his
career
be
borrow
from
friedland
friedland
taught
steve
the
reality
distortion
field
say
kottke
he
be
charismatic
and
a
bit
of
a
con
man
and
could
bend
situation
to
his
very
strong
will
he
be
mercurial
sure
of
himself
a
little
dictatorial
steve
admire
that
and
he
become
more
like
that
after
spending
time
with
robert

also
absorbed
how
friedland
make
himself
the
center
of
attention
robert
be
very
much
an
outgo
charismatic

i
first
met
steve
he
be
shy
and
self
efface
a
very
private
guy
i
think
robert
taught
him
a
lot
about
sell
about
come
out
of
his
shell
of
opening
up
and
take
charge
of
a
situation
friedland
project
a
high
wattage
aura
he
would
walk
into
a
room
and
you
would
instantly
notice
him
steve
be
the
absolute
opposite
when
he
come
to
reed
after
he
spent
time
with

of
it
start

in
tow
they
would
dance

work
ourselves
into
an
ecstatic
frenzy
holmes
recall
robert
would
go
insane
and
dance
like
crazy
steve
be
more
subdue
as
if
he
be

year
i
thought
he

be
very
upset
because
we
have
go
to
all
that
trouble

create
these
feast
and
he
couldn
t
hold
it
down
job
be
also
begin
to
have
a
little
trouble
stomach
friedland
s
cult
leader
style
perhaps
he
saw
a
little
bit
too
much
of
robert
in
himself
say
kottke
although
the

be
suppose
to
be
a
refuge

communal
economics
be
not

him
it
start
to
get
very
materialistic
job
recall
everybody
get
the
idea
they
be
work
very
hard
for
robert
s
farm
and
one
by
one
they
start
to

i
get
pretty
sick
of

robert
always
portrayed
himself
as
a
spiritual
person
but
he
cross
the
line
from
be
charismatic
to
be
a
con
man
job
say
it
be
a
strange
thing
to
have
one
of
the
spiritual
people
in
your
young
life
turn
out
to
be
symbolically
and
in

he
like
be
at

just
not
take
the
require
class
in
fact
he
be
surprised
when
he
found
out
that
for
all
of
its
hippie
aura
there
be
strict
course
requirement
when
wozniak

what
they
do
in
college
job
refuse
to
go
to
the
class
he
be
assign
and
instead
go
to
the
one
he
want
such
as
a
dance
class
where
he
could
enjoy
both
the
creativity
and
the
chance
to
meet
girl
i
would
never
have
refuse
to
take
the
course
you
be
suppose
to
that
s
a
difference
in
our
personality
wozniak
marvel
job
also
begin
to
feel
guilty
he
later
say
about
spending
so
much
of
his
parent
money
on
an
education
that
do
not
seem
worthwhile
all
of
my
work
class
parent
saving
be
be
spent
on
my
college
tuition
he
recount
in
a
famous
commencement
address
at
stanford
i
have
no
idea
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
life
and
no
idea
how
college
be
go
to
help
me
figure
it
out
and
here
i
be
spending
all
of
the
money
my
parent
have
save
their
entire
life
so
i
decide
to
drop
out
and
trust
that
it
would
all
work
out
okay
he
didn
t
actually
want
to
leave
reed
he
just
want
to
quit
pay
tuition
and
take
class
that
didn
t
interest
him
remarkably
reed
tolerate
that
he
have
a
very
inquire
mind
that
be
enormously
attractive
say
the
dean
of
student
jack
dudman
he
refuse
to
accept
automatically
receive
truth
and
he
want
to
examine
everything
himself
dudman
allow
job
to
audit
class
and
stay
with
friend
in
the
dorm
even
after
he
stop
pay
tuition
the
minute
i
drop
out
i
could
stop
take
the
require
class
that
didn
t
interest
me
and
begin
drop
in
on
the
one
that
look
interest
he
say
among
them
be
a
calligraphy
class
that
appeal
to
him
after
he
saw
poster
on
campus
that
be
beautifully
drawn
i
learn
about
serif
and
sans
serif
typeface
about
vary
the
amount
of
space
between
different
letter
combination
about
what
make
great
typography
great
it
be
beautiful
historical
artistically
subtle
in
a
way
that
science
can
t
capture
and
i
found
it
fascinate
it
be
yet
another
example
of
job
consciously
position
himself
at
the
intersection
of
the
art
and
technology
in
all
of
his
product
technology
would
be
married
to
great
design
elegance
human
touch
and
even
romance
he
would
be
in
the
fore
of
push
friendly

user
interface
the
calligraphy
course
would
become
iconic
in
that
regard
if
i
have
never
drop

course
in

the

implement
the
vision
and
curb
the
enthusiasm
of
bushnell
their
big
hit
thus
far
be
a
video
game
call
pong
in
which
two
player
try
to
volley
a
blip
on
a
screen
with
two
movable
line
that
act
as
paddle
if
you
re
under
thirty
ask
your
parent
when
job
arrive
in
the
atari
lobby
wear
sandal
and
demand
a
job
alcorn
be
the
one
who
be
summon
i
be
told
we
ve
get
a
hippie
kid
in
the
lobby
he
say
he
s
not
go
to
leave
until
we
hire
him
should
we
call
the
cop
or
let
him
in
i
say
bring
him
on
in
job
thus
become
one
of
the
first
fifty
employee
at
atari
work
as
a
technician
for
an
hour
in
retrospect
it
be
weird
to
hire
a
dropout
from
reed
alcorn
recall
but
i
saw
something
in
him
he
be
very
intelligent
enthusiastic
excite
about
tech
alcorn
assign
him
to
work
with
a
straitlaced
engineer
name
don
lang
the
next
day
lang
complain
this
guy
s
a
goddamn
hippie
with
b
o
why
do
you
do
this
to
me
and
he
s
impossible
to
deal
with
job
clung
to
the
belief
that
his
fruit
heavy
vegetarian
diet
would
prevent
not
just
mucus
but
also
body
odor
even
if
he
didn
t
use
deodorant
or
shower
regularly
it
be
a
flaw
theory
lang
and
others
want
to
let
job
go
but
bushnell
work
out
a
solution
the
smell
and
behavior
wasn
t
an
issue
with
me
he
say
steve
be
prickly
but
i
kind
of
like
him
so
i
ask
him
to
go
on
the
night
shift
it
be
a
way
to
save
him
job
would
come
in
after
lang
and
others
have
left
and
work
through
most
of
the
night
even
thus
isolated
he
become
know
for
his
brashness
on
those
occasion
when
he
happen
to
interact
with
others
he
be
prone
to
inform
them
that
they
be
dumb
shit
in
retrospect
he
stand
by
that
judgment
the
only
reason
i
shone
be
that
everyone
else
be
so
bad
job
recall
despite
his
arrogance
or
perhaps
because
of
it
he
be
able
to
charm
atari
s
bos
he
be
more
philosophical
than
the
other
people
i
work
with
bushnell
recall
we
use
to
discus
free
will
versus
determinism
i
tend
to
believe
that
thing
be
much
more
determine
that
we
be
programmed
if
we
have
perfect
information
we
could
predict
people
s
action
steve
felt
the
opposite
that
outlook
accord
with
his
faith
in
the
power
of
the
will
to
bend
reality
job
help
improve
some
of
the
game
by
push
the
chip
to
produce
fun
design
and
bushnell
s
inspire
willingness
to
play
by
his
own
rule
rubbed
off
on
him
in
addition
he
intuitively
appreciate
the
simplicity
of
atari
s
game
they
come
with
no
manual
and
need
to
be
uncomplicated
enough
that
a
stone
freshman
could
figure
them
out
the
only
instruction
for
atari
s
star
trek
game
be
insert
quarter
avoid
klingons
not
all
of
his
coworkers
shun
job
he
become
friend
with
ron
wayne
a
draftsman
at
atari
who
have
earlier
start
a
company
that
built
slot
machine
it
subsequently
fail
but
job
become
fascinate
with
the
idea
that
it
be
possible
to
start
your
own
company
ron
be
an
amaze
guy
say
job
he
start
company
i
have
never
met
anybody
like
that
he
propose
to
wayne
that
they
go
into
business
together
job
say
he
could
borrow
and
they
could
design
and
market
a
slot
machine
but
wayne
have
already
be
burn
in
business
so
he
decline
i
say
that
be
the
quick
way
to
lose
wayne
recall
but
i
admire
the
fact
that
he
have
a
burning
drive
to
start
his
own
business
one
weekend
job
be
visit
wayne
at
his
apartment
engage
as
they
often
do
in
philosophical
discussion
when
wayne
say
that
there
be
something
he
need
to
tell
him
yeah
i
think
i
know
what
it
be
job
reply
i
think
you
like
men
wayne
say
yes
it
be
my
first
encounter
with
someone
who
i
knew
be
gay
job
recall
he
plant
the
right
perspective
of
it
for
me
job
grill
him
when
you
see
a
beautiful
woman
what
do
you
feel
wayne
reply
it
s
like
when
you
look
at
a
beautiful
horse
you
can
appreciate
it
but
you
don
t
want
to
sleep
with
it
you
appreciate
beauty
for
what
it
be
wayne
say
that
it
be
a
testament
to
job
that
he
felt
like
reveal
this
to
him
nobody
at
atari
knew
and
i
could
count
on
my
toe
and
finger
the
number
of
people
i
told
in
my
whole
life
but
i
guess
it
just
felt
right
to
tell
him
that
he
would
understand
and
it
didn
t
have
any
effect
on
our
relationship
india
one
reason
job
be
eager
to
make
some
money
in
early
be
that
robert
friedland
who
have
go
to
india
the
summer
before
be
urge
him
to
take
his
own
spiritual
journey
there
friedland
have
study
in
india
with
neem
karoli
baba
maharaj
ji
who
have
be
the
guru
to
much
of
the
sixty
hippie
movement
job
decide
he
should
do
the
same
and
he
recruit
daniel
kottke
to
go
with
him
job
be
not
motivate
by
mere
adventure
for
me
it
be
a
serious
search
he
say
i
d
be
turn
on
to
the
idea
of
enlightenment
and
try
to
figure
out
who
i
be
and
how
i
fit
into
thing
kottke
add
that
job
s
quest
seem
driven
partly
by
not
know
his
birth
parent
there
be
a
hole
in
him
and
he
be
try
to
fill
it
when
job
told
the
folk
at
atari
that
he
be
quit
to
go
search
for
a
guru
in
india
the
jovial
alcorn
be
amuse
he
come
in
and
stare
at
me
and
declares
i
m
go
to
find
my
guru
and
i
say
no
shit
that
s
super
write
me
and
he
say
he
want
me
to
help
pay
and
i
tell
him
bullshit
then
alcorn
have
an
idea
atari
be
make
kit
and
shipping
them
to
munich
where
they
be
built
into
finish
machine
and
distribute
by
a
wholesaler
in
turin
but
there
be
a
problem
because
the
game
be
design
for
the
american
rate
of
sixty
frame
per
second
there
be
frustrate
interference
problem
in
europe
where
the
rate

alcorn

and
then
offer
to
pay
for

s
get
to
be
cheaper
to
get
to

from
there
he

for
me

a
few
day
in
munich
where
he

but
in
the
process

dark
suit

they
complain
to

he
continued
try
to
find
himself
it
be
a
pursuit
with
many
path
toward
enlightenment
in
the
morning
and
evening
he
would
meditate
and
study
zen
and
in
between
he
would
drop
in
to
audit
physic
or
engineering
course
at
stanford
the
search
job
s
interest
in
eastern
spirituality
hinduism
zen
buddhism
and
the
search
for
enlightenment
be
not
merely
the
passing
phase
of
a
nineteen
year
old
throughout
his
life
he
would
seek
to
follow
many
of
the
basic
precept
of
eastern
religion
such
as
the
emphasis
on
experiential
praj
wisdom
or
cognitive
understand
that
be
intuitively
experienced
through
concentration
of
the
mind
year
later
sit
in
his
palo
alto
garden
he
reflect
on
the
last
influence
of
his
trip
to
india
come
back
to
america
be
for
me
much
more
of
a
cultural
shock
than
go
to
india
the
people
in
the
indian
countryside
don
t
use
their
intellect
like
we
do
they
use
their
intuition
instead
and
their
intuition
be
far
more
developed
than
in
the
rest
of
the
world
intuition
be
a
very
powerful
thing
more
powerful
than
intellect
in
my
opinion
that
s
have
a
big
impact
on
my
work
western
rational
thought
be
not
an
innate
human
characteristic
it
be
learn
and
be
the
great
achievement
of
western
civilization
in
the
village
of
india
they
never
learn
it
they
learn
something
else
which
be
in
some
way
just
as
valuable
but
in
other
way
be
not
that
s
the
power
of
intuition
and
experiential
wisdom
come
back
after
seven
month
in
indian
village
i
saw
the
craziness
of
the
western
world
as
well
as
its
capacity
for
rational
thought
if
you
just
sit
and
observe
you
will
see
how
restless
your
mind
be
if
you
try
to
calm
it
it
only
make
it
bad
but
over
time
it
do
calm
and
when
it
do
there
s
room
to
hear
more
subtle
thing
that
s
when
your
intuition
start
to
blossom
and
you
start
to
see
thing
more
clearly
and
be
in
the
present
more
your
mind
just
slows
down
and
you
see
a
tremendous
expanse
in
the
moment
you
see
so
much
more
than
you
could
see
before
it
s
a
discipline
you
have
to
practice
it
zen
have
be
a
deep
influence
in
my
life

be
nothing
over
there

t
here
and
he
be
correct
i

the
truth
of
the
zen

that
if
you
be
willing

travel
around

would
be
a
bonus
bushnell
told
him
for
every
chip
few
than
fifty
that
he
use
bushnell
knew
that
job
be
not
a
great
engineer
but
he
assume
correctly
that
he
would
recruit
wozniak
who
be
always
hang
around
i
look
at
it
as
a
two
for
one
thing
bushnell
recall
woz
be
a
well
engineer
wozniak
be
thrill
when
job
ask
him
to
help
and
propose
splitting
the
fee
this
be
the
most
wonderful
offer
in
my
life
to
actually
design
a
game
that
people
would
use
he
recall
job
say
it
have
to
be
do
in
four
day
and
with
the
few
chip
possible
what
he
hid
from
wozniak
be
that
the
deadline
be
one
that
job
have
impose
because
he
need
to
get
to
the
all
one
farm
to
help
prepare
for
the
apple
harvest
he
also
didn
t
mention
that
there
be
a
bonus
tie
to
keep
down
the
number
of
chip
a
game
like
this
might
take
most
engineer
a
few
month
wozniak
recall
i
thought
that
there
be
no
way
i
could
do
it
but
steve
make
me
sure
that
i
could
so
he
stayed
up
four
night
in
a
row
and
do
it
during
the
day
at
hp
wozniak
would
sketch
out
his
design
on
paper
then
after
a
fast
food
meal
he
would
go
right
to
atari
and
stay
all
night
as
wozniak
churn
out
the
design
job
sat
on
a
bench
to
his
left
implement
it
by
wire
wrap
the
chip
onto
a
breadboard
while
steve
be
breadboarding
i
spent
time
play
my
favorite
game
ever
which
be
the
auto
race
game
gran
trak
wozniak
say
astonishingly
they
be
able
to
get
the
job
do
in
four
day
and
wozniak
use
only
forty
five
chip
recollection
differ
but
by
most
account
job
simply
give
wozniak
half
of
the
base
fee
and
not
the
bonus
bushnell
paid
for
save
five
chip
it
would
be
another
ten
year
before
wozniak
discover
by
be
show
the
tale
in
a
book
on
the
history
of
atari
title
zap
that
job
have
be
paid
this
bonus
i
think
that
steve
need
the
money
and
he
just
didn
t
tell
me
the
truth
wozniak
later
say
when
he
talk
about
it
now
there
be
long
pause
and
he
admits
that
it
cause
him
pain
i
wish
he
have
just
be
honest
if
he
have
told
me
he
need
the
money
he
should
have
know
i
would
have
just
give
it
to
him
he
be
a
friend
you
help
your
friend
to
wozniak
it
show
a
fundamental
difference
in
their
character
ethic
always
matter
to
me
and
i
still
don
t
understand
why
he
would
ve
gotten
paid
one
thing
and
told
me
he
d
gotten
paid
another
he
say
but
you
know
people
be
different
when
job
learn
this
story
be
publish
he
call
wozniak
to
deny
it
he
told
me
that
he
didn
t
remember
do
it
and
that
if
he
do
something
like
that
he
would
remember
it
so
he
probably
didn
t
do
it
wozniak
recall
when
i
ask
job
directly
he
become
unusually
quiet
and
hesitant
i
don
t
know
where
that
allegation
come
from
he
say
i
give
him
half
the
money
i
ever
get
that
s
how
i
ve
always
be
with
woz
i
mean
woz
stop
work
in
he
never
do
one
ounce
of
work
after
and
yet
he
get
exactly
the
same
share
of
apple
stock
that
i
do
be
it
possible
that
memory
be
muddle
and
that
job
do
not
in
fact
shortchange
wozniak
there
s
a
chance
that
my
memory
be
all
wrong
and
mess
up
wozniak
told
me
but
after
a
pause
he
reconsider
but
no
i
remember
the
detail
of
this
one
the
check
he
confirm
his
memory
with
nolan
bushnell
and
al
alcorn
i
remember
talk
about
the
bonus
money
to
woz
and
he
be
upset
bushnell
say
i
say
yes
there
be
a
bonus
for
each
chip
they
save
and
he
just
shook
his
head
and
then
clucked
his
tongue
whatever
the
truth
wozniak
later
insist
that
it
be
not
worth
rehash
job
be
a
complex
person
he
say
and
be
manipulative
be
just
the
darker
facet
of
the
trait
that
make
him
successful
wozniak
would
never
have
be
that
way
but
as
he
point
out
he
also
could
never
have
built
apple
i
would
rather
let
it
pas
he
say
when
i
press
the
point
it
s
not
something
i
want
to
judge
steve
by
the
atari
experience
help
shape
job
s
approach
to
business
and
design
he
appreciate
the
user
friendliness
of
atari
s
insert
quarter
avoid
klingons
game
that
simplicity
rubbed
off
on
him
and
make
him
a
very
focus
product
person
say
ron
wayne
job
also
absorbed
some
of
bushnell
s
take
no
prisoner
attitude
nolan
wouldn
t
take
no
for
an
answer
accord
to
alcorn
and
this
be
steve
s
first
impression
of
how
thing
get
do
nolan
be
never
abusive
like
steve
sometimes
be
but
he
have
the
same
driven
attitude
it
make
me
cringe
but
dammit
it
get
thing
do
in
that
way
nolan
be
a
mentor
for
job
bushnell
agree
there
be
something
indefinable
in
an
entrepreneur
and
i
saw
that
in
steve
he
say
he
be
interested
not
just
in
engineering
but
also
the
business
aspect
i
taught
him
that
if
you
act
like
you
can
do
something
then
it
will
work
i
told
him
pretend
to
be
completely
in
control
and

the
altair
wasn
t
much
just
a
pile
of
part
that
have
to
be
solder
to
a
board
that
would
then
do
little
but
for
hobbyist
and
hacker
it
herald
the
dawn
of
a

read
the
magazine
and
start
work
on
a
version
of
basic
an
easy
to
use
program
language
for
the
altair
it
also
caught
the
attention
of
job
and
wozniak
and
when
an
altair
kit
arrive
at
the
people
s
computer
company
it
become
the
centerpiece
for
the
first
meeting
of
the
club
that
french
and
moore
have
decide
to
launch
the
homebrew
computer
club
the
group
become
know
as
the
homebrew
computer
club
and
it
encapsulate
the
whole
earth
fusion
between
the
counterculture
and
technology
it
would
become
to
the
personal
computer
era
something
akin
to
what
the
turk
s
head
coffeehouse
be
to
the
age
of
dr
johnson
a
place
where
idea
be
exchange
and
disseminate
moore
write
the
flyer
for
the
first
meeting
held
on
march
in
french
s
menlo
park
garage
be
you
building
your
own
computer
terminal
tv
typewriter
it
ask
if
so
you
might
like
to
come
to
a
gathering
of
people
with
like
mind
interest
allen
baum
spot
the
flyer
on
the
hp
bulletin
board
and
call
wozniak
who
agree
to
go
with
him
that
night
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
night
of
my
life
wozniak
recall
about
thirty
other
people
show
up
spill
out
of
french
s
open
garage
door
and
they
take
turn
describe
their
interest
wozniak
who
later
admit
to
be
extremely
nervous
say
he
like
video
game
pay
movie
for
hotel
scientific
calculator
design
and
tv
terminal
design
accord
to
the
minute
prepared
by
moore
there
be
a
demonstration
of
the
new
altair
but
more
important
to
wozniak
be
see
the
specification
sheet
for
a
microprocessor
as
he
thought
about
the
microprocessor
a
chip
that
have
an
entire
central
processing
unit
on
it
he
have
an
insight
he
have
be
design
a
terminal
with
a
keyboard
and
monitor
that
would
connect
to
a
distant
minicomputer
use
a
microprocessor
he
could
put
some
of
the
capacity
of
the
minicomputer
inside
the
terminal
itself
so
it
could
become
a
small
stand
alone
computer
on
a
desktop
it
be
an
endure
idea
keyboard
screen
and
computer
all
in
one
integrate
personal
package
this
whole
vision
of
a
personal
computer
just
popped
into
my
head
he
say
that
night
i
start
to
sketch
out
on
paper
what
would
later
become
know
as
the
apple
i
at
first
he
plan
to
use
the
same
microprocessor
that
be
in
the
altair
an
intel
but
each
of
those
cost
almost
more
than
my
monthly
rent
so
he
look
for
an
alternative
he
found
one
in
the
motorola
which
a
friend
at
hp
be
able
to
get
for
apiece
then
he
discover
a
chip
make
by
mo
technology
that
be
electronically
the
same
but
cost
only
it
would
make
his
machine
affordable
but
it
would
carry
a
long
term
cost
intel
s
chip
end
up
become
the
industry
standard
which
would
haunt
apple
when
its
computer
be
incompatible
with
it
after
work
each
day
wozniak
would
go
home
for
a
tv
dinner
and
then
return
to
hp
to
moonlight
on
his
computer
he
spread
out
the
part
in
his
cubicle
figure
out
their
placement
and
solder
them
onto
his
motherboard
then
he
begin
write
the
software
that
would
get
the
microprocessor
to
display
image
on
the
screen
because
he
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
computer
time
he
write
the
code
by
hand
after
a
couple
of
month
he
be
ready
to
test
it
i
typed
a
few
key
on
the
keyboard
and
i
be
shock
the
letter
be
displayed
on
the
screen
it
be
sunday
june
a
milestone
for
the
personal
computer
it
be
the
first
time
in
history
wozniak
later
say
anyone
have
typed
a
character
on
a
keyboard
and
see
it
show
up
on
their
own
computer
s
screen
right
in
front
of
them
job
be
impressed
he
pepper
wozniak
with
question
could
the
computer
ever
be
networked
be
it
possible
to
add
a
disk
for
memory
storage
he
also
begin
to
help
woz
get
component
particularly
important
be
the
dynamic
random
access
memory
chip
job
make
a
few
call
and
be
able
to
score
some
from
intel
for
free
steve
be
just
that
sort
of
person
say
wozniak
i
mean
he
knew
how
to
talk
to
a
sale
representative
i
could
never
have
do
that
i
m
too
shy
job
begin
to
accompany
wozniak
to
homebrew
meeting
carry
the
tv
monitor
and
help
to
set
thing
up
the
meeting
now
attract
more
than
one
hundred
enthusiast
and
have
be
move
to
the
auditorium
of
the
stanford
linear
accelerator
center
preside
with
a
pointer
and
a
free
form
manner
be
lee
felsenstein
another
embodiment
of
the
merger
between
the
world
of
compute
and
the
counterculture
he
be
an
engineering
school
dropout
a
participant
in
the
free
speech
movement
and
an
antiwar
activist
he
have
write
for
the
alternative
newspaper
berkeley
barb
and
then
go
back
to
be
a
computer
engineer
woz
be
usually
too
shy
to
talk
in
the
meeting
but
people
would
gather
around
his
machine
afterward
and
he
would
proudly
show
off
his
progress
moore
have
try
to
instill
in
the
homebrew
an
ethos
of
swap
and
share
rather
than
commerce
the
theme
of
the
club
woz
say
be
give
to
help
others
it
be
an
expression
of
the
hacker
ethic
that
information
should
be
free
and
all
authority
mistrust
i
design
the
apple
i
because
i
want
to
give
it
away
for
free
to
other
people
say
wozniak
this
be
not
an
outlook
that
bill
gate
embrace
after
he
and
paul
allen
have
complete
their
basic
interpreter
for
the
altair
gate
be
appalled
that
member
of
the
homebrew
be
make
copy
of
it
and
share
it
without
pay
him
so
he
write
what
would
become
a
famous
letter
to
the
club
as
the
majority
of
hobbyist
must
be
aware
most
of
you
steal
your
software
be
this
fair
one
thing
you
do
be
prevent
good
software
from
be
write
who
can
afford
to
do
professional
work
for
nothing
i
would
appreciate
letter
from
anyone
who
want
to
pay
up
steve
job
similarly
do
not
embrace
the
notion
that
wozniak
s
creation
be
it
a
blue
box
or
a
computer
want
to
be
free
so
he
convince
wozniak
to
stop
give
away
copy
of
his
schematic
most
people
didn
t
have
time
to
build
it
themselves
anyway
job
argue
why
don
t
we
build
and
sell
print
circuit
board
to
them
it
be
an
example
of
their
symbiosis
every
time
i
d
design
something
great
steve
would
find
a
way
to
make
money
for
us
say
wozniak
wozniak
admit
that
he
would
have
never
thought
of
do
that
on
his
own
it
never
cross
my
mind
to
sell
computer
it
be
steve
who
say
let
s
hold
them
in
the
air
and
sell
a
few
job
work
out
a
plan
to
pay
a
guy
he
knew
at
atari
to
draw
the
circuit
board
and
then
print
up
fifty
or
so
that
would
cost
about
plus
the
fee
to
the
designer
they
could
sell
them
for
apiece
and
perhaps
clear
a
profit
of
wozniak
be
dubious
that
they
could
sell
them
all
i
didn
t
see
how
we
would
make
our
money
back
he
recall
he
be
already
in
trouble
with
his
landlord
for
bounce
check
and
now
have
to
pay
each
month
in
cash
job
knew
how
to
appeal
to
wozniak
he
didn
t
argue
that
they
be
sure
to
make
money
but
instead
that
they
would
have
a
fun
adventure
even
if
we
lose
our
money
we
ll
have
a
company
say
job
as
they
be
drive
in
his
volkswagen
bus
for
once
in
our
life
we
ll
have
a
company
this
be
entice
to
wozniak
even
more
than
any
prospect
of
get
rich
he
recall
i
be
excite
to
think
about
us
like
that
to
be
two
best
friend
start
a
company
wow
i
knew
right
then
that
i
d
do
it
how
could
i
not
in
order
to
raise
the
money
they
need
wozniak
sell
his
hp
calculator
for
though
the
buyer
end
up
stiffing
him
for
half
of
that
for
his
part
job
sell
his
volkswagen
bus
for
but
the
person
who
bought
it
come
to
find
him
two
week
later
and
say
the
engine
have
broken
down
and
job
agree
to
pay
for
half
of
the
repair
despite
these
little
setback
they
now
have
with
their
own
small
saving
thrown
in
about
in
work
capital
the
design
for
a
product
and
a
plan
they
would
start
their
own
computer
company
apple
be
born
now
that
they
have
decide
to
start
a
business
they
need
a
name
job
have
go
for
another
visit
to
the
all
one
farm
where
he
have
be
prune
the
gravenstein
apple
tree
and
wozniak
picked
him
up
at
the
airport
on
the
ride
down
to
los
alto
they
bandy
around
option
they
consider
some
typical
tech
word
such
as
matrix
and
some
neologism
such
as
executek
and
some
straightforward
boring
name
like
personal
computer
inc
the
deadline
for
decide
be
the
next
day
when
job
want
to
start
filing
the
paper
finally
job
propose
apple
computer
i
be
on
one
of
my
fruitarian
diet
he
explain
i
have
just
come
back
from
the
apple
farm
it
sound
fun
spirit
and
not
intimidate
apple
take
the
edge
off
the
word
computer
plus
it
would
get
us
ahead
of
atari
in
the
phone
book
he
told
wozniak
that
if
a
well
name
do
not
hit
them
by
the
next
afternoon
they
would
just
stick
with
apple
and
they
do
apple
it
be
a
smart
choice
the
word
instantly
signal
friendliness
and
simplicity
it
manage
to
be
both
slightly
off
beat
and
as
normal
as
a
slice
of
pie
there
be
a
whiff
of
counterculture
back
to
nature
earthiness
to
it
yet
nothing
could
be
more
american
and
the
two
word
together
apple
computer
provide
an
amuse
disjuncture
it
doesn
t
quite
make
sense
say
mike
markkula
who
soon
thereafter
become
the
first
chairman
of
the
new
company
so
it
force
your
brain
to
dwell
on
it
apple
and
computer
that
doesn
t
go
together
so
it
help
us
grow
brand
awareness
wozniak
be
not
yet
ready
to
commit
full
time
he
be
an
hp
company
man
at
heart
or
so
he
thought
and
he
want
to
keep
his
day
job
there
job
realize
he
need
an
ally
to
help
corral
wozniak
and
adjudicate
if
there
be
a
disagreement
so
he
enlist
his
friend
ron
wayne
the
middle
age
engineer
at
atari
who
have
once
start
a
slot
machine
company
wayne
knew
that
it
would
not
be
easy
to
make
wozniak
quit
hp
nor
be
it
necessary
right
away
instead
the
key
be
to
convince
him
that
his
computer
design
would
be
own
by
the
apple
partnership
woz
have
a
parental
attitude
toward
the
circuit
he
developed
and
he
want
to
be
able
to
use
them
in
other
application
or
let
hp
use
them
wayne
say
job
and
i
realize
that
these
circuit
would
be
the
core
of
apple
we
spent
two
hour
in
a
roundtable
discussion
at
my
apartment
and
i
be
able
to
get
woz
to
accept
this
his
argument
be
that
a
great
engineer
would
be
remember
only
if
he
team
with
a
great
marketer
and
this
require
him
to
commit
his
design
to
the
partnership
job
be
so
impressed
and
grateful
that
he
offer
wayne
a
stake
in
the
new
partnership
turn
him
into
a
tie
breaker
if
job
and
wozniak
disagreed
over
an
issue
they
be
very
different
but
they
make
a
powerful
team
say
wayne
job
at
time
seem
to
be
driven
by
demon
while
woz
seem
a
na
f
who
be
toyed
with
by
angel
job
have
a
bravado
that
help
him
get
thing
do
occasionally
by
manipulate
people
he
could
be
charismatic
even
mesmerize
but
also
cold
and
brutal
wozniak
in
contrast
be
shy
and
socially
awkward
which
make
him
seem
childishly
sweet
woz
be
very
bright
in
some
area
but
he
s
almost
like
a
savant
since
he
be
so
stunt
when
it
come
to
deal
with
people
he
didn

call
up
people
he
didn

know
and
make
them
do
thing
wozniak
recall
he
could
be
rough
on
people
he
didn
t
think
be
smart
but
he
never
treat
me
rudely
even
in
later
year
when
maybe
i
couldn
t
answer
a
question
as
well
as
he
want
even
after
wozniak
become
convince
that
his
new
computer
design
should
become
the
property
of
the
apple
partnership
he
felt
that
he
have
to
offer
it
first
to
hp
since
he
be
work
there
i
believe
it
be
my
duty
to
tell
hp
about
what
i
have
design
while
work
for
them
that
be
the
right
thing
and
the
ethical
thing
so
he
demonstrate
it
to
his
manager
in
the
spring
of
the
senior
executive
at
the
meeting
be
impressed
and
seem
torn
but
he
finally
say
it
be
not
something
that
hp
could
develop
it
be
a
hobbyist
product
at
least
for
now
and
didn
t
fit
into
the

high
quality

segment
i
be
disappointed
wozniak

wayne
who
worried
about

kept
his

instead
he

living
alone
in
a
small
home
in
pahrump
nevada
where
he
played
the

machine
and
live
off

he
later
claimed
he

wozniak
take
the
stage
together
for
a
presentation
to
the
homebrew
computer
club
shortly
after
they
sign

wozniak
held
up
one
of
their
newly
produce
circuit
board
and
described
the
microprocessor
the
eight
kilobyte
of

and
the
version
of
basic
he
have
write
he
also
emphasize
what
he
call
the
main
thing
a
human
typable
keyboard
instead
of
a
stupid
cryptic
front
panel
with
a
bunch
of
light
and
switch
then
it
be
job

out
that
the
apple
unlike
the
altair
have
all
the
essential
component
built

then
he
challenged
them
with
a
question
how
much
would
people
be
willing
to
pay
for
such
a
wonderful
machine
he
be
try
to
get
them
to
see
the
amaze
value
of
the

it
be
a
rhetorical
flourish
he
would
use
at
product
presentation
over
the
ensue
decade
the
audience
be
not
very
impressed
the
apple
have
a
cut
rate
microprocessor
not
the
intel
but
one
important
person
stayed
behind
to
hear
more
his

be
paul

and
in

that
might
appeal
to
a
few
hard
core
hobbyist
but
not
to
most
customer
instead
he
want
the

the

never

wozniak
spent
most
of
his

in

what
he

do
not

wozniak
he
felt
reassure
be
the
best
circuit
engineer
and
the
apple

and
surely
its
successor
could
beat
the

in

of

however
the

of

he
come
to
the
realization
that
paul

of
the

have
be
right
personal
computer
should
come
in
a

the

integrate
end
to
end
from
the

to
the

my
vision
be
to
create
the
first
fully
package
computer
he
recall
we
be
no
longer
aim
for
the
handful
of
hobbyist
who
like
to
assemble
their
own
computer
who
knew
how
to
buy
transformer
and
keyboard
for
every
one
of
them
there
be
a
thousand
people
who
would
want
the
machine
to
be
ready
to
run
in
their
hotel
room
on
that
labor
day
weekend
of
wozniak
tinker
with
the
prototype
of
the
new
machine
to
be
name
the
apple
ii
that
job
hop
would
take
them
to
this
next
level
they
brought
the
prototype
out
only
once
late
at
night
to
test
it
on
the
color
projection
television
in
one
of
the
conference
room
wozniak
have
come
up
with
an
ingenious
way
to
goose
the
machine
s
chip
into
create
color
and
he
want
to
see
if
it
would
work
on
the
type
of
television
that
us
a
projector
to
display
on
a
movie
like
screen
i
figure
a
projector
might
have
a
different
color
circuitry
that
would
choke
on
my
color
method
he
recall
so
i
hooked
up
the
apple
ii
to
this
projector
and
it
work
perfectly
as
he
typed
on
his
keyboard
colorful
line
and
swirl
burst
on
the
screen
across
the
room
the
only
outsider
who
saw
this
first
apple
ii
be
the
hotel
s
technician
he
say
he
have
look
at
all
the
machine
and
this
be
the
one
he
would
be
buying
to
produce
the
fully
package
apple
ii
would
require
significant
capital
so
they
consider
sell
the
right
to
a
large
company
job
go
to
al
alcorn
and
ask
for
the
chance
to
pitch
it
to
atari
s
management
he
set
up
a
meeting
with
the
company
s
president
joe
keenan
who
be
a
lot
more
conservative
than
alcorn
and
bushnell
steve
go
in
to
pitch
him
but
joe
couldn
t
stand
him
alcorn
recall
he
didn
t
appreciate
steve
s
hygiene
job
be
barefoot
and
at
one
point
put
his
foot
up
on
a
desk
not
only
be
we
not
go
to
buy
this
thing
keenan
shout
but
get
your
foot
off
my
desk
alcorn
recall
think
oh
well
there
go
that
possibility
in
september
chuck
peddle
of
the
commodore
computer
company
come
by
the
job
house
to
get
a
demo
we
d
open
steve
s
garage
to
the
sunlight
and
he
come
in
wear
a
suit
and
a
cowboy
hat
wozniak
recall
peddle
love
the
apple
ii
and
he
arrange
a
presentation
for
his
top
brass
a
few
week
later
at
commodore
headquarters
you
might
want
to
buy
us
for
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollar
job
say
when
they
get
there
wozniak
be
stun
by
this
ridiculous
suggestion
but
job
persist
the
commodore
honcho
call
a
few
day
later
to
say
they
have
decide
it
would
be
cheaper
to
build
their
own
machine
job
be
not
upset
he
have
checked
out
commodore
and
decide
that
its
leadership
be
sleazy
wozniak
do
not
rue
the
lose
money
but
his
engineering
sensibility
be
offend
when
the
company
come
out
with
the
commodore
pet
nine
month
later
it
kind
of
sicken
me
they
make
a
real
crappy
product
by
do
it
so
quick
they
could
have
have
apple
the
commodore
flirtation
brought
to
the
surface
a
potential
conflict
between
job
and
wozniak
be
they
truly
equal
in
what
they
contribute
to
apple
and
what
they
should
get
out
of
it
jerry
wozniak
who
exalt
the
value
of
engineer
over
mere
entrepreneur
and
marketer
thought
most
of
the
money
should
be
go
to
his
son
he
confront
job
personally
when
he
come
by
the
wozniak
house
you
don
t
deserve
shit
he
told
job
you
haven
t
produce
anything
job
begin
to
cry
which
be
not
unusual
he
have
never
be
and
would
never
be
adept
at
contain
his
emotion
he
told
steve
wozniak
that
he
be
willing
to
call
off
the
partnership
if
we
re
not
fifty
fifty
he
say
to
his
friend
you
can
have
the
whole
thing
wozniak
however
understood
well
than
his
father
the
symbiosis
they
have
if
it
have
not
be
for
job
he
might
still
be
hand
out
schematic
of
his
board
for
free
at
the
back
of
homebrew
meeting
it
be
job
who
have
turn
his
ingenious
design
into
a
budding
business
just
as
he
have
with
the
blue
box
he
agree
they
should
remain
partner
it
be
a
smart
call
to
make
the
apple
ii
successful
require
more
than
just
wozniak
s
awesome
circuit
design
it
would
need
to
be
package
into
a
fully
integrate
consumer
product
and
that
be
job
s
role
he
begin
by
ask
their
erstwhile
partner
ron
wayne
to
design
a
case
i
assume
they
have
no
money
so
i
do
one
that
didn
t
require
any
tool
and
could
be
fabricate
in
a
standard
metal
shop
he
say
his
design
call
for
a
plexiglas
cover
attach
by
metal
strap
and
a
rolltop
door
that
slid
down
over
the
keyboard
job
didn
t
like
it
he
want
a
simple
and
elegant
design
which
he
hop
would
set
apple
apart
from
the
other
machine
with
their
clunky
gray
metal
case
while
haunt
the
appliance
aisle
at
macy
s
he
be
struck
by
the
cuisinart
food
processor
and
decide
that
he
want
a
sleek
case
make
of
light
mold
plastic
at
a
homebrew
meeting
he
offer
a
local
consultant
jerry
manock
to
produce
such
a
design
manock
dubious
about
job
s
appearance
ask
for
the
money
up
front
job
refuse
but
manock
take
the
job
anyway
within
week
he
have
produce
a
simple
foam
mold
plastic
case
that
be
uncluttered
and
exude
friendliness
job
be
thrill
next
come
the
power
supply
digital
geek
like
wozniak
paid
little
attention
to
something
so
analog
and
mundane
but
job
decide
it
be
a
key
component
in
particular
he
want
as
he
would
his
entire
career
to
provide
power
in
a
way
that
avoid
the
need
for
a
fan
fan
inside
computer
be
not
zen
like
they
distract
he
drop
by
atari
to
consult
with
alcorn
who
knew
old
fashion
electrical
engineering
al
turn
me
on
to
this
brilliant
guy
name
rod
holt
who
be
a
chain
smoking
marxist
who
have
be
through
many
marriage
and
be
an
expert
on
everything
job
recall
like
manock
and
others
meeting
job
for
the
first
time
holt
take
a
look
at
him
and
be
skeptical
i
m
expensive
holt
say
job
sense
he
be
worth
it
and
say
that
cost
be
no
problem
he
just
con
me
into
work
say
holt
who
end
up
join
apple
full
time
instead
of
a
conventional
linear
power
supply
holt
built
one
like
those
use
in
oscilloscope
it
switch
the
power
on
and
off
not
sixty
time
per
second
but
thousand
of
time
this
allow
it
to
store
the
power
for
far
less
time
and
thus
throw
off
less
heat
that
switch
power
supply
be
as
revolutionary
as
the
apple
ii
logic
board
be
job
later
say
rod
doesn
t
get
a
lot
of
credit
for
this
in
the
history
book
but
he
should
every
computer
now
us
switch
power
supply
and
they
all
rip
off
rod
s
design
for
all
of
wozniak
s
brilliance
this
be
not
something
he
could
have
do
i
only
knew
vaguely
what
a
switch
power
supply
be
woz
admit
job
s
father
have
once
taught
him
that
a
drive
for
perfection
meant
care
about
the
craftsmanship
even
of
the
part
unseen
job
apply
that
to
the
layout
of
the
circuit
board
inside
the
apple
ii
he
reject
the
initial
design
because
the
line
be
not
straight
enough
this
passion
for
perfection
lead
him
to
indulge
his
instinct
to
control
most
hacker
and
hobbyist
like
to
customize
modify
and
jack
various
thing
into
their
computer
to
job
this
be
a
threat
to
a
seamless
end
to
end
user
experience
wozniak
a
hacker
at
heart
disagreed
he
want
to
include
eight
slot
on
the
apple
ii
for
user
to
insert
whatever
small
circuit
board
and
peripheral
they
might
want
job
insist
there
be
only
two
for
a
printer
and
a
modem
usually
i
m
really
easy
to
get
along
with
but
this
time
i
told
him
if
that
s
what
you
want
go
get
yourself
another
computer
wozniak
recall
i
knew
that
people
like
me
would
eventually
come
up
with
thing
to
add
to
any
computer
wozniak
won
the
argument
that
time
but
he
could
sense
his
power
wan
i
be
in
a
position
to
do
that
then
i
wouldn

he
usually
didn
t
deliver
on
time

do
it
markkula

plan
envision
way
of
get
beyond
the
hobbyist

to
regular
people

wozniak
recall
markkula
make
a
wild
prediction
we
re
go
to
be
a
fortune
company
in
two
year
he
say
this
be
the
start
of
an
industry
it
happens
once
in
a
decade
it
would
take
apple
seven
year
to
break
into
the
fortune
but
the
spirit
of
markkula
s
prediction
turn
out
to
be
true
markkula
offer
to
guarantee
a
line
of
credit
of
up
to
in
return
for
be
make
a
one
third
equity
participant
apple
would
incorporate
and
he
along
with
job
and
wozniak
would
each
own
of
the
stock
the
rest
would
be
reserve
to
attract
future
investor
the
three
met
in
the
cabana
by
markkula
s
swim
pool
and
seal
the
deal
i
thought
it
be
unlikely
that
mike
would
ever
see
that
again
and
i
be
impressed
that
he
be
willing
to
risk
it
job
recall
now
it
be
necessary
to
convince
wozniak
to
come
on
board
full
time
why
can
t
i
keep
do
this
on
the
side
and
just
have
hp
as
my
secure
job
for
life
he
ask
markkula
say
that
wouldn
t
work
and
he
give
wozniak
a
deadline
of
a
few
day
to
decide
i
felt
very
insecure
in
start
a
company
where
i
would
be
expect
to
push
people
around
and
control
what
they
do
wozniak
recall
i
d
decide
long
ago
that
i
would
never
become
someone
authoritative
so
he
go
to
markkula
s
cabana
and
announce
that
he
be
not
leave
hp
markkula
shrug
and
say
okay
but
job
get
very
upset
he
cajole
wozniak
he
get
friend
to
try
to
convince
him
he
cry
yell
and
threw
a
couple
of
fit
he
even
go
to
wozniak
s
parent
house
burst
into
tear
and
ask
jerry
for
help
by
this
point
wozniak
s
father
have
realize
there
be
real
money
to
be
make
by
capitalize
on
the

and

he
emphasize
that
you
should
never
start
a
company
with
the
goal
of
get
rich
your
goal
should
be
make
something
you
believe
in
and
make
a
company
that
will
last
markkula
write
his
principle
in
a
one
page
paper
title
the
apple
marketing
philosophy
that
stress
three
point
the
first
be
empathy
an
intimate
connection
with
the
feeling
of
the
customer
we
will
truly
understand
their
need
well
than
any
other
company
the
second
be
focus
in
order
to
do
a
good
job
of
those
thing
that
we
decide
to
do
we
must
eliminate
all
of
the
unimportant
opportunity
the
third
and
equally
important
principle
awkwardly
name
be
impute
it
emphasize
that
people
form
an
opinion
about
a
company
or
product
base
on
the
signal
that
it
conveys
people
do
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
he
write
we
may
have
the
best
product
the
high
quality
the
most
useful
software
etc
if
we
present
them
in
a
slipshod
manner
they
will
be
perceive
as
slipshod
if
we
present
them
in
a
creative
professional
manner
we
will
impute
the
desire
quality
for
the
rest
of
his
career
job
would
understand
the
need
and
desire
of
customer
well
than
any
other
business
leader
he
would
focus
on
a
handful
of
core
product
and
he
would
care
sometimes
obsessively
about
marketing
and
image
and
even
the
detail
of
packaging
when
you
open
the
box
of
an
iphone
or
ipad
we
want
that
tactile
experience
to
set
the
tone
for
how
you
perceive
the
product
he
say

how
we
would
all
have
to
dress

nicely
how
we
should
appear
and
look
how
we
should
act
wozniak

it
be
worth
the
effort
the
apple
ii
look
solid
yet
friendly
in
its
sleek
beige

and
markkula
s
injunction
could
not
however
stop
the
irrepressible
wozniak
from
play
some
practical
joke
one
program
that
he
displayed
try
to
guess
people
s
nationality
from
their
last
name
and
then
produce
the
relevant
ethnic
joke
he
also
create
and
distribute
a
hoax
brochure
for
a
new
computer
call
the
zaltair
with
all
sort
of
fake
ad
copy
superlative
like
imagine
a
car
with
five
wheel
job
briefly
fell
for
the
joke
and
even
take
pride
that
the
apple
ii
stack
up
well
against
the
zaltair
in
the
comparison
chart
he
didn
t
realize
who
have
pull
the
prank
until
eight
year
later
when

now
a
real
company
with
a
dozen

a
line
of
credit
and
the
daily
pressure
that
can
come
from
customer
and
supplier
it
have
even
move
out
of
the
job
garage
finally
into
a
rent
office
on
stevens
creek
boulevard
in
cupertino
about
a
mile
from
where
job
and
wozniak
go
to
high
school
job
do
not
wear
his
grow
responsibility
gracefully
he
have
always
be
temperamental
and
bratty
at
atari
his
behavior
have
cause
him
to
be
banish
to
the
night
shift
but
at
apple
that
be
not
possible
he
become
increasingly
tyrannical
and
sharp
in
his
criticism
accord
to
markkula
he
would
tell
people
that
design
look
like
shit
he
be
particularly
rough
on
wozniak
s
young
programmer
randy
wigginton
and
chris
espinosa
steve
would
come
in
take
a
quick
look
at
what
i
have
do
and
tell
me
it
be
shit
without
have
any
idea
what
it
be
or
why
i
have
do
it
say
wigginton
who
be
just
out
of
high
school
there
be
also
the
issue
of
his
hygiene
he
be
still
convince
against
all
evidence
that
his
vegan
diet
meant
that
he
didn
t
need
to
use
a
deodorant
or
take
regular
shower
we
would
have
to
literally
put
him
out
the
door
and
tell
him
to
go
take
a
shower
say
markkula
at
meeting
we
have
to
look
at
his
dirty
foot
sometimes
to
relieve
stress
he
would
soak
his
foot
in
the
toilet
a
practice
that
be
not
as
soothe
for
his
colleague
markkula
be
averse
to
confrontation
so
he
decide
to
bring
in
a
president
mike
scott
to
keep
a
tighter
rein
on
job
markkula
and
scott
have
join
fairchild

the
same
day
in

he
look
like
a
great
choice
he
be
run
a
manufacturing
line
for
national
semiconductor
and
he
have
the
advantage
of
be
a
manager
who
fully
understood
engineering
in
person
however
he
have
some
quirk
he
be
overweight
afflict
with
tic
and
health
problem
and
so
tightly
wound
that
he
wander
the
hall
with
clenched
fist
he
also
could
be
argumentative
in
deal
with
job
that
could
be
good
or
bad
wozniak
quickly
embrace
the
idea
of

with
the
conflict
that
job
engender

have
one
primary
duty
manage
job
this
be
usually
accomplish
by
job
s
prefer
mode
of
meeting
which
be
take
a
walk
together
my
very
first
walk
be
to
tell
him
to
bathe
more
often
scott
recall
he
say
that
in
exchange
i
have
to
read
his
fruitarian
diet
book
and
consider
it
as
a
way
to
lose
weight
scott
never
adopt
the
diet
or
lose
much
weight
and
job
make
only
minor
modification
to
his
hygiene
steve
be
adamant
that
he
bath
once
a
week
and
that
be
adequate
as
long
as
he
be
eat
a
fruitarian
diet
job
s
desire
for
control
and
disdain
for
authority
be
destine
to
be
a
problem
with
the
man
who
be
brought
in
to
be
his
regent
especially
when
job
discover
that
scott
be
one
of
the
only
people
he
have
yet
encounter
who
would
not
bend
to
his
will
the
question
between
steve
and
me
be
who
could
be
most
stubborn
and
i
be
pretty
good
at
that
scott
say
he
need
to
be
sat
on
and
he
sure
didn
t
like
that
job
later
say
i
never
yell
at
anyone
more
than

demand
to
be
i
wouldn

let
him
have
it
because
that
would
stoke
his
ego
even
more
say
scott
job
threw
a
tantrum
even
cry
finally
he
propose
a
solution
he
would
have
badge
scott
relent
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
the
badge
but
the
bank
of
america
require
a
positive
integer
for
its
payroll
system
and
job
s
remain
there
be
a
more
fundamental
disagreement
that

mike
scott
on
the
other
hand
never
let
a
passion
for
the
perfect
take
precedence
over
pragmatism
the
design
of
the
apple
ii
case
be
one
of
many
example
the
pantone

for
its
plastic
have
more
than
two
thousand

enough
for
steve
scott
marvel
he
want
to
create
a
different
shade
and
i
have
to
stop
him
when
the
time
come
to
tweak
the
design
of
the
case
job
spent
day
agonize
over
just
how
round

corner
should
be
i
didn
t
care
how
round
they
be

scott
want
a
standard
gray
job
insist
on
special
order
bench
that
be
pure
white
all
of
this
finally
lead
to
a
showdown
in
front
of
markkula
about
whether
job
or
scott
have
the
power
to
sign
purchase
order
markkula
side
with
scott
job
also

in
how
it
treat
customer
he
want
a
one
year
warranty
to

warranty
be
ninety

during
one
of
their
argument
over
the
issue
they
walk
around
the
parking
lot
to
calm
down
and
scott
decide
to
relent
on
this
one
wozniak
begin
to
rankle
at
job
s
style
steve
be
too
tough
on
people
i
want
our
company
to
feel
like
a
family
where
we
all
have
fun
and
share
whatever
we
make
job
for
his
part
felt
that
wozniak
simply
would
not
grow
up
he
be
very
childlike
he
do
a
great
version
of
basic
but
then
never
could
buckle
down
and
write
the

basic
we
need
so
we
end
up
later
have
to
make
a
deal
with
microsoft
he
be
just
too
unfocused
but
for
the
time
be
the

arthur
rock
have
initially
be
unimpressed
when
markkula
sent

him
he
look
as
if
he

wozniak
deserves
the
historic
credit
for
the
design
of

inspire
circuit
board
and
related
operating
software
which
be
one
of
the
era

job
be
the
one
who
integrate
wozniak

into
a
friendly
package
from
the

also
create
the

sprang
up
around
wozniak

but
it
would

today
be
it
not
for
steve

nevertheless
most
people
consider
the

creation
that
would
spur

and
the
next
year
they
decide
to
make
their
own
pilgrimage
to
india
job
advise
calhoun
not
to
take
brennan
with
him
say
that
she
would
interfere
with
his
spiritual
quest
but
they
go
together
anyway
i
be
just
so
impressed
by
what
happen
to
steve
on
his
trip
to
india
that
i
want
to
go
there
she
say
theirs
be
a
serious
trip
begin
in
march
and
last
almost
a
year
at
one
point
they
ran
out
of
money
so
calhoun
hitchhike
to
iran
to
teach
english
in
tehran
brennan
stayed
in
india
and
when
calhoun
s
teach
stint
be
over
they
hitchhike
to
meet
each
other
in
the
middle
in
afghanistan
the
world
be
a
very
different
place
back
then
after
a
while
their
relationship
frayed
and
they
return
from
india
separately
by
the
summer
of
brennan
have
move
back
to
los
alto
where
she
live
for
a
while
in
a
tent
on
the
ground
of
kobun
chino
s
zen
center
by
this
time
job
have
move
out
of
his
parent
house
and
be
rent
a
per
month
suburban
ranch
house
in
cupertino
with
daniel
kottke
it
be
an
odd
scene
of
free
spirit
hippie
type
living
in
a
tract
house
they
dubbed
rancho
suburbia
it
be
a
four
bedroom
house
and
we
occasionally
rent
one
of
the
bedroom
out
to
all
sort
of
crazy
people
include
a
stripper
for
a
while
recall
job
kottke
couldn
t
quite
figure
out
why
job
have
not
just
gotten
his
own
house
which
he
could
have
afford
by
then
i
think
he
just
want
to
have
a
roommate
kottke
speculate
even
though
her
relationship
with
job
be
sporadic
brennan
soon
move
in
as
well
this
make
for
a
set
of
living
arrangement
worthy
of
a
french
farce
the
house
have
two
big
bedroom
and
two
tiny
one
job
not
surprisingly
commandeer
the
large
of
them
and
brennan
who
be
not
really
living
with
him
move
into
the
other
big
bedroom
the
two
middle
room
be
like
for
baby
and
i
didn
t
want
either
of
them
so
i
move
into
the
living
room
and
slept
on
a
foam
pad
say
kottke
they
turn
one
of
the
small
room
into
space
for
meditate
and
drop
acid
like
the
attic
space
they
have
use
at
reed
it
be
fill
with
foam
pack
material
from
apple
box
neighborhood
kid
use
to
come
over
and
we
would
toss
them
in
it
and
it
be
great
fun
say
kottke
but
then
chrisann
brought
home
some
cat
who
peed
in
the
foam
and
then
we
have
to
get
rid
of
it
living
in
the
house
at
time
rekindle
the
physical
relationship
between
brennan
and
job
and
within
a
few
month
she
be
pregnant
steve
and
i
be
in
and
out
of
a
relationship
for
five
year
before
i
get
pregnant
she
say
we
didn
t
know
how
to
be
together
and
we
didn
t
know
how
to
be
apart
when
greg
calhoun
hitchhike
from
colorado
to
visit
them
on
thanksgiving
brennan
told
him
the
news
steve
and
i
get
back
together
and
now
i
m
pregnant
but
now
we
be
on
again
and
off
again
and
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
calhoun
notice
that
job
be
disconnect
from
the
whole
situation
he
even
try
to
convince
calhoun
to
stay
with
them
and
come
to
work
at
apple
steve
be
just
not
deal
with
chrisann
or
the
pregnancy
he
recall
he
could
be
very
engage
with
you
in
one
moment
but
then
very
disengage
there
be
a
side
to
him
that
be
frighteningly
cold
when
job
do
not
want
to
deal
with
a
distraction
he
sometimes
just
ignore
it
as
if
he
could
will
it
out
of
existence
at
time
he
be
able
to
distort
reality
not
just
for
others
but
even
for
himself
in
the
case
of
brennan
s
pregnancy
he
simply
shut
it
out
of
his
mind
when
confront
he
would
deny
that
he
knew
he
be
the
father
even
though
he
admit
that
he
have
be
sleep
with
her
i
wasn
t
sure
it
be
my
kid
because
i
be
pretty
sure
i
wasn
t
the
only
one
she
be
sleep
with
he
told
me
later
she
and
i
be
not
really
even
go
out
when
she
get
pregnant
she
just
have
a
room
in
our
house
brennan
have
no
doubt
that
job
be
the
father
she
have
not
be
involve
with
greg
or
any
other
men
at
the
time
be
he
lie
to
himself
or
do
he
not
know
that
he
be
the
father
i
just
think
he
couldn
t
access
that
part
of
his
brain
or
the
idea
of
be
responsible
kottke
say
elizabeth
holmes
agree
he
consider
the
option
of
parenthood
and
consider
the
option
of
not
be
a
parent
and
he
decide
to
believe
the
latter
he
have
other
plan
for
his
life
there
be
no
discussion
of
marriage
i
knew
that
she
be
not
the
person
i
want
to
marry
and
we
would
never
be
happy
and
it
wouldn
t
last
long
job
later
say
i
be
all
in
favor
of
her
get
an
abortion
but
she
didn
t
know
what
to
do
she
thought
about
it
repeatedly
and
decide
not
to
or
i
don
t
know
that
she
ever
really
decide
i
think
time
just
decide
for
her
brennan
told
me
that
it
be
her
choice
to
have
the
baby
he
say
he
be
fine
with
an
abortion
but
never
push
for
it
interestingly
give
his
own
background
he
be
adamantly
against
one
option
he
strongly
discourage
me
put
the
child
up
for
adoption
she
say
there
be
a
disturb
irony
job
and
brennan
be
both
twenty
three
the
same
age
that
joanne
schieble
and
abdulfattah
jandali
have
be
when
they
have
job
he
have
not
yet
tracked
down
his
biological
parent
but
his
adoptive
parent
have
told
him
some
of
their
tale
i
didn
t
know
then
about
this
coincidence
of
our
age
so
it
didn
t
affect
my
discussion
with
chrisann
he
later
say
he
dismiss
the
notion
that
he
be
somehow
follow
his
biological
father
s
pattern
of
get
his
girlfriend
pregnant
when
he
be
twenty
three
but
he
do
admit
that
the
ironic
resonance
give
him
pause
when
i
do
find
out
that
he
be
twenty
three
when
he
get
joanne
pregnant
with
me
i
thought
whoa
the
relationship
between
job
and
brennan
quickly
deteriorate
chrisann
would
get
into
this
kind
of
victim
mode
when
she
would
say
that
steve
and
i
be
gang
up
on
her
kottke
recall
steve
would
just
laugh
and
not
take
her
seriously
brennan
be
not
as
even
she
later
admit
very
emotionally
stable
she
begin
break
plate
throw
thing
trash
the
house
and
write
obscene
word
in
charcoal
on
the
wall
she
say
that
job
kept
provoke
her
with
his
callousness
he
be
an
enlighten
be
who
be
cruel
kottke
be
caught
in
the
middle
daniel
didn
t
have
that
dna
of
ruthlessness
so
he
be
a
bit
flip
by
steve
s
behavior
accord
to
brennan
he
would
go
from
steve
s
not
treat
you
right
to
laugh
at
me
with
steve
robert
friedland
come
to
her
rescue
he
heard
that
i
be
pregnant
and
he
say
to
come
on
up
to
the
farm
to
have
the

recall
so
i
do

brennan
s
family
be
surprised
but
job
knew
that
apple
would
soon
be
go
public
and
he
decide
it
be
best
to
get
the
issue
resolve
dna
test
be
new
and
the
one
that
job
take
be
do
at
ucla
i
have
read
about
dna
test
and
i
be
happy
to
do
it
to
get
thing
settle
he
say
the
result
be
pretty
dispositive
probability
of
paternity
be
the
report
read
the
california
court
order
job
to
start
pay
a
month
in
child
support

the
county
in

welfare
payment
he
be
give
visitation
right
but
for
a
long
time
didn
t
exercise
them
even
then
job
continued
at
time
to
warp
the
reality
around
him
he
finally
told
us
on
the
board
arthur
rock
recall
but
he
kept
insist
that
there
be
a
large
probability
that
he
wasn
t
the
father
he
be
delusional
he
told
a
reporter
for
time
michael
moritz
that
when
you
analyze
the
statistic
it
be
clear
that
of
the
male
population
in
the
united
state
could
be
the
father
it
be
not
only
a
false
claim
but
an
odd
one
bad
yet
when
chrisann
brennan
later
heard
what
he
say
she
mistakenly
thought
that
job
be
hyperbolically
claim
that
she
might
have
slept
with
of
the
men
in
the
united
state
he
be
try
to
paint
me
as
a
slut
or
a
whore
she
recall
he
spun
the
whore
image
onto
me
in
order
to
not
take
responsibility
year
later
job
be
remorseful
for
the
way
he
behave
one
of
the
few
time
in
his
life
he
admit
as
much
i
wish
i
have
handle
it
differently
i
could
not
see
myself
as
a
father
then
so
i
didn
t
face
up
to
it
but
when
the
test
result
show
she
be
my
daughter
it
s
not
true
that
i
doubt
it
i
agree
to
support
her
until
she
be
eighteen
and
give
some
money
to
chrisann
as
well
i
found
a
house

a

the

take
the

from

to
the
pinnacle
of
a
new

its
sale
rise
dramatically
from
unit
in

but
job
be
restless
the
apple
ii
could
not
remain
successful
forever
and
he
knew
that
no
matter
how
much
he
have
do
to
package
it
from
power
cord
to
case
it
would
always
be
see
as
wozniak
s
masterpiece
he
need
his
own
machine
more
than
that
he
want
a
product
that
would
in
his
word
make
a
dent
in
the
universe
at
first
he
hop
that
the
apple
iii
would
play
that
role
it
would
have
more
memory
the
screen
would
display
eighty
character
across
rather
than
forty
and
it
would
handle
uppercase
and
lowercase
letter
indulge
his
passion
for
industrial
design
job
decreed
the
size
and
shape
of
the
external
case
and
he
refuse
to
let
anyone
alter
it
even
as
committee
of
engineer
add
more
component
to
the
circuit
board
the
result
be
piggybacked
board
with
poor
connector
that
frequently
fail
when
the
apple
iii
begin
shipping
in
may
it
flop
randy
wigginton
one
of
the
engineer
sum
it
up
the
apple
iii
be
kind
of
like
a
baby
conceive
during
a
group
orgy
and
later
everybody
have
this
bad
headache
and
there
s
this
bastard
child
and
everyone
say
it
s
not
mine
by
then
job
have
distance
himself
from
the
apple
iii
and
be
thrash
about
for
way
to
produce
something
more
radically
different
at
first
he
flirt
with
the
idea
of
touchscreen
but
he
found
himself
frustrate
at
one
demonstration
of
the
technology
he
arrive
late
fidget
awhile
then
abruptly
cut
off
the
engineer
in
the
middle
of
their
presentation
with
a
brusque
thank
you
they
be
confuse
would
you
like
us
to
leave
one
ask
job
say
yes
then
berate
his
colleague
for
waste
his
time
then
he
and
apple
hire
two
engineer
from
hewlett
packard
to
conceive
a
totally
new
computer
the
name
job
chose
for
it
would
have
cause
even
the
most
jade
psychiatrist
to
do
a
double
take
the
lisa
other
computer
have
be
name
after
daughter
of
their
designer
but
lisa
be
a
daughter
job
have
abandon
and
have
not
yet
fully
admit
be
his
maybe
he
be
do
it
out
of
guilt
say
andrea
cunningham
who
work
at
regis
mckenna
on
public
relation
for
the
project
we
have
to
come
up
with
an
acronym
so
that
we
could
claim
it
be
not
name
after
lisa
the
child
the
one
they
reverse
engineer
be
local
integrate
system
architecture
and
despite
be
meaningless
it
become
the
official
explanation
for
the
name
among
the
engineer
it
be
refer
to
as
lisa
invent
stupid
acronym
year
later
when
i
ask
about
the
name
job
admit
simply
obviously
it
be
name
for
my
daughter
the
lisa
be
conceive
as
a
machine
base
on
a
sixteen
bit
microprocessor
rather
than
the
eight
bit
one
use
in
the
apple
ii
without
the
wizardry
of
wozniak
who
be
still
work
quietly
on
the
apple
ii
the
engineer
begin
produce
a
straightforward
computer
with
a
conventional
text
display
unable
to
push
the
powerful
microprocessor
to
do
much
excite
stuff
job
begin
to
grow
impatient
with
how
boring
it
be
turn
out
to
be
there
be
however
one
programmer
who
be
infuse
the
project
with
some
life
bill
atkinson
he
be
a
doctoral
student
in
neuroscience
who
have
experiment
with
his
fair
share
of
acid
when
he
be
ask
to
come
work
for
apple
he
decline
but
then
apple
sent
him
a
nonrefundable
plane
ticket
and
he
decide
to
use
it
and
let
job
try
to
persuade
him
we
be
invent
the
future
job
told
him
at
the
end
of
a
three
hour
pitch
think
about
surf
on
the
front
edge
of
a
wave
it
s
really
exhilarate
now
think
about
dog
paddle
at
the
tail
end
of
that
wave
it
wouldn
t
be
anywhere
near
as
much
fun
come
down
here
and
make
a
dent
in
the
universe
atkinson
do
with
his
shaggy
hair
and
droopy
moustache
that
do
not
hide
the
animation
in
his
face
atkinson
have
some
of
woz
s
ingenuity
along
with
job
s
passion
for
awesome
product
his
first
job
be
to
develop
a
program
to
track
a
stock
portfolio
by
auto
dial
the
dow
jones
service
get
quote
then
hang
up
i
have
to
create
it
fast
because
there
be
a
magazine
ad
for
the
apple
ii
show
a
hubby
at
the
kitchen
table
look
at
an
apple
screen
fill
with
graph
of
stock
price
and
his
wife
be
beam
at
him
but
there
wasn
t
such
a
program
so
i
have
to
create
one
next
he
create
for
the
apple
ii
a
version
of
pascal
a
high
level
program
language
job
have
resist
think
that
basic
be
all
the
apple
ii
need
but
he
told
atkinson
since
you
re
so
passionate
about
it
i
ll
give
you
six
day
to
prove
me
wrong
he
do
and
job
respect
him
ever
after
by
the
fall
of
apple
be
breeding
three
pony
to
be
potential
successor
to
the
apple
ii
workhorse
there
be
the
ill
fat
apple
iii
there
be
the
lisa
project
which
be
begin
to
disappoint
job
and
somewhere
off
job
s
radar
screen
at
least
for
the
moment
there
be
a
small
skunkworks
project
for
a
low
cost
machine
that
be
be
developed
by
a
colorful
employee
name
jef
raskin
a
former
professor
who
have
taught
bill
atkinson
raskin
s
goal
be
to
make
an
inexpensive
computer
for
the
mass
that
would
be
like
an
appliance
a
self
contain
unit
with
computer
keyboard
monitor
and
software
all
together
and
have
a
graphical
interface
he
try
to
turn
his
colleague
at
apple
on
to
a
cut
edge
research
center
right
in
palo
alto
that
be
pioneer
such
idea
xerox
parc
the
xerox
corporation
s
palo
alto
research
center
know
as
xerox
parc
have
be
establish
in
to
create
a
spawn
ground
for
digital
idea
it
be
safely
locate
for
well
and
for
bad
three
thousand
mile
from
the
commercial
pressure
of
xerox
corporate
headquarters
in
connecticut
among
its
visionary
be
the
scientist
alan
kay
who
have
two
great
maxim
that
job
embrace
the
best
way
to
predict
the
future
be
to
invent
it
and
people
who
be
serious
about
software
should
make
their
own
hardware
kay
push
the
vision
of
a
small
personal
computer
dubbed
the
dynabook
that
would
be
easy
enough
for
child
to
use
so
xerox
parc
s
engineer
begin
to
develop
user
friendly
graphic
that
could
replace
all
of
the
command
line
and
do
prompt
that
make
computer
screen
intimidate
the
metaphor
they
come
up
with
be
that
of
a
desktop
the
screen
could
have
many
document
and
folder
on
it
and
you
could
use
a
mouse
to
point
and
click
on
the
one
you
want
to
use
this
graphical
user
interface
or
gui
pronounce
gooey
be
facilitate
by
another
concept
pioneer
at
xerox
parc
bitmapping
until
then
most
computer
be
character
base
you
would
type
a
character
on
a
keyboard
and
the
computer
would
generate
that
character
on
the
screen
usually
in
glow
greenish
phosphor
against
a
dark
background
since
there
be
a
limited
number
of
letter
numeral
and
symbol
it
didn
t
take
a
whole
lot
of
computer
code
or
processing
power
to
accomplish
this
in
a
bitmap
system
on
the
other
hand
each
and
every
pixel
on
the
screen
be
control
by
bit
in
the
computer
s
memory
to
render
something
on
the
screen
such
as
a
letter
the
computer
have
to
tell
each
pixel
to
be
light
or
dark
or
in
the
case
of
color
display
what
color
to
be
this
us
a
lot
of
compute
power
but
it
permit
gorgeous
graphic
font
and
gee
whiz
screen
display
bitmapping
and
graphical
interface
become
feature
of
xerox
parc
s
prototype
computer
such
as
the
alto
and
its
object
orient
program
language
smalltalk
jef
raskin
decide
that
these
feature
be
the
future
of

so
he
begin
urge
job
and
other
apple
colleague
to
go
check
out
xerox
parc
raskin
have
one
problem
job
regard
him
as
an
insufferable
theorist
or
to
use
job
s
own
more
precise
terminology
a
shithead
who
suck
so
raskin
enlist
his
friend
atkinson
who
fell
on
the
other
side
of
job
s
shithead
genius
division
of
the
world
to
convince
job
to
take
an
interest
in
what
be
happen
at
xerox
parc
what
raskin
didn
t
know
be
that
job
be
work
on
a
more
complex
deal
xerox
s
venture
capital
division
want
to
be
part
of
the
second
round
of
apple
financing
during
the
summer
of
job
make
an
offer
i
will
let
you
invest
a
million
dollar
in
apple
if
you
will
open
the
kimono
at
parc
xerox
accepted
it
agree
to
show
apple
its
new
technology
and
in
return
get
to
buy
share
at
about
each
by
the
time
apple
go
public
a
year
later
xerox
s
million
worth
of

be
worth
million
but
apple
get
the
well
end
of
the
bargain
job
and
his
colleague
go
to
see
xerox
parc
s
technology
in
december
and
when
job
realize
he
hadn
t
be
show
enough
get
an
even
fuller
demonstration
a
few
day
later
larry
tesler
be
one
of
the
xerox
scientist
call
upon
to
do
the
briefing
and
he
be
thrill
to
show
off
the
work
that
his
boss
back
east
have
never
seem
to
appreciate
but
the
other
briefer
adele
goldberg
be
appalled
that
her
company
seem
willing
to
give
away
its
crown
jewel
it
be
incredibly
stupid
completely
nut
and
i
fought
to
prevent
give
job
much
of
anything
she
recall
goldberg
get
her
way
at
the
first
briefing
job
raskin
and
the
lisa
team
leader
john
couch
be
ushered
into
the
main
lobby
where
a
xerox
alto
have
be
set
up
it
be
a
very
control
show
of
a
few
application
primarily
a
word
processing
one
goldberg
say
job
wasn
t
satisfied
and
he
call
xerox
headquarters
demand
more
so
he
be
invite
back
a
few
day
later
and
this
time
he
brought
a
large
team
that
include
bill
atkinson

bruce

an
apple

work
at
xerox
parc
they
both
knew
what
to
look
for
when
i
arrive
at
work
there
be
a
lot
of
commotion
and
i
be
told
that
job
and
a
bunch
of
his
programmer
be
in
the
conference
room
say
goldberg
one
of
her
engineer
be
try
to
keep
them
entertain
with
more
display
of
the
word
processing
program
but
job
be
grow
impatient
let
s
stop
this
bullshit
he
kept
shout
so
the
xerox
folk
huddle
privately
and
decide
to
open
the
kimono
a
bit
more
but
only
slowly
they
agree
that
tesler
could
show
off
smalltalk
the
program
language
but
he
would
demonstrate
only
what
be
know
as
the
unclassified
version
it
will
dazzle
job
and
he
ll
never
know
he
didn
t
get
the
confidential
disclosure
the
head
of
the
team
told
goldberg
they
be
wrong
atkinson
and
others
have
read
some
of
the
paper
publish
by
xerox
parc
so
they
knew
they
be
not
get
a
full
description
job
phone
the
head
of
the
xerox
venture
capital
division
to
complain
a
call
immediately
come
back
from
corporate
headquarters
in
connecticut
decree
that
job
and
his
group
should
be
show
everything
goldberg
storm
out
in
a
rage
when
tesler
finally
show
them
what
be
truly
under
the
hood
the
apple
folk
be
astonish
atkinson
star
at
the
screen
examine
each
pixel
so
closely
that
tesler
could
feel
the
breath
on
his
neck
job
bounce
around
and
wave
his
arm
excitedly
he
be
hop
around
so
much
i
don
t
know
how
he
actually
saw
most
of
the
demo
but
he
do
because
he
kept
ask
question
tesler
recall
he
be
the
exclamation
point
for
every
step
i
show
job
kept
say
that
he
couldn
t
believe
that
xerox
have
not
commercialize
the
technology
you
re
sit
on
a
gold
mine
he
shout
i
can
t
believe
xerox
be
not
take
advantage
of
this
the
smalltalk
demonstration
show
three
amaze
feature
one
be
how
computer
could
be
networked
the
second
be
how
object
orient
program
work
but
job
and
his
team
paid
little
attention
to
these
attribute
because
they
be
so
amaze
by
the
third
feature
the
graphical
interface
that
be
make
possible
by
a
bitmapped
screen
it
be
like
a
veil
be
lift
from
my
eye
job
recall
i
could
see
what
the
future
of
compute
be
destine
to
be
when
the
xerox
parc
meeting
end
after
more
than
two
hour
job
drove
bill
atkinson
back
to
the
apple
office
in
cupertino
he
be
speed
and
so
be
his
mind
and
mouth
this
be
it
he
shout
emphasize
each
word
we
ve
get
to
do
it
it
be
the
breakthrough
he
have
be
look
for
bring
computer
to
the
people
with
the
cheerful
but
affordable
design
of
an
eichler
home
and
the
ease
of
use
of
a
sleek
kitchen
appliance
how
long
would
this
take
to
implement
he
ask
i
m
not
sure
atkinson
reply
maybe
six
month
it
be
a
wildly
optimistic
assessment
but
also
a
motivate
one
great
artist
steal
the
apple
raid
on
xerox
parc
be
sometimes
described
as
one
of
the
big
heist
in
the
chronicle
of
industry
job
occasionally
endorse
this
view
with
pride
as
he
once
say
picasso
have
a
say
good
artist
copy
great
artist
steal
and
we
have
always
be
shameless
about
steal
great
idea
another
assessment
also
sometimes
endorse
by
job
be
that
what
transpire
be
less
a
heist
by
apple
than
a
fumble
by
xerox
they
be
copier
head
who
have
no
clue
about
what
a
computer
could
do
he
say
of
xerox
s
management
they
just
grabbed
defeat
from
the
great
victory
in
the
computer
industry
xerox
could
have
own
the
entire
computer
industry
both
assessment
contain
a
lot
of
truth
but
there
be
more
to
it
than
that
there
fall
a
shadow
as
t
s
eliot
note
between
the
conception
and
the
creation
in
the
annals
of
innovation
new
idea
be
only
part
of
the
equation
execution
be
just
as
important
job
and
his
engineer
significantly
improve
the
graphical
interface
idea
they
saw
at
xerox
parc
and
then
be
able
to
implement
them
in
way
that
xerox
never
could
accomplish
for
example
the
xerox
mouse
have
three
button
be
complicate
cost
apiece
and
didn
t
roll
around
smoothly
a
few
day
after
his
second
xerox
parc
visit
job
go
to
a
local
industrial
design
firm
ideo
and
told
one
of
its
founder
dean
hovey
that
he
want
a
simple
single
button
model
that
cost
and
i
want
to
be
able
to
use
it
on
formica
and
my
blue
jean
hovey
comply
the
improvement
be
in
not
just
the
detail
but
the
entire
concept
the
mouse
at
xerox
parc
could
not
be
use
to
drag
a
window
around
the
screen
apple
s
engineer
devise
an
interface
so
you
could
not
only
drag
window
and
file
around
you
could
even
drop
them
into
folder
the
xerox
system
require
you
to
select
a
command
in
order
to
do
anything
range
from
resize
a
window
to
change
the
extension
that
locate
a
file
the
apple
system
transform
the
desktop
metaphor
into
virtual
reality
by
allow
you
to
directly
touch
manipulate
drag
and
relocate
thing
and
apple
s
engineer
work
in
tandem
with
its
designer
with
job
spur
them
on
daily
to
improve
the
desktop
concept
by
add
delightful
icon
and
menu
that
pull
down
from
a
bar
atop
each
window
and
the
capability
to
open
file
and
folder
with
a
double
click
it
s
not
as
if
xerox
executive
ignore
what
their
scientist
have
create
at
parc
in
fact
they
do
try
to
capitalize
on
it
and
in
the
process
they
show
why
good
execution
be
as
important
as
good
idea
in
well
before
the
apple
lisa
or
macintosh
they
introduce
the
xerox
star
a
machine
that
feature
their
graphical
user
interface
mouse
bitmapped
display
window
and
desktop
metaphor
but
it
be
clunky
it
could
take
minute
to
save
a
large
file
costly
at
retail
store
and
aim
mainly
at
the
networked
office
market
it
flop
only
thirty
thousand
be
ever
sell
job
and
his
team
go
to
a
xerox
dealer
to
look
at
the
star
as
soon
as
it
be
release
but
he
deem
it
so
worthless
that
he
told
his
colleague
they
couldn
t
spend
the
money
to
buy
one
we
be
very
relieve
he
recall
we
knew
they
hadn
t
do
it
right
and
that
we
could
at
a
fraction
of
the
price
a
few
week
later
he
call
bob
belleville
one
of
the
hardware
designer
on
the
xerox
star
team
everything
you
ve
ever
do
in
your
life
be
shit
job
say
so
why
don
t
you
come
work
for
me
belleville
do
and
so
do
larry
tesler
in
his
excitement
job
begin
to
take
over
the
daily
management
of
the
lisa
project
which
be
be
run
by
john
couch
the
former
hp
engineer
ignore
couch
he
dealt
directly
with
atkinson
and
tesler
to
insert
his
own
idea
especially
on
lisa
s
graphical
interface
design
he
would
call
me
at
all
hour
a
m
or
a
m
say
tesler
i
love
it
but
it
upset
my
boss
at
the
lisa
division
job
be
told
to
stop
make
out
of
channel
call
he
held
himself
back
for
a
while
but
not
for
long
one
important
showdown
occur
when
atkinson
decide
that
the
screen
should
have
a
white
background
rather
than
a
dark
one
this
would
allow
an
attribute
that
both
atkinson
and
job
want
wysiwyg
pronounce
wiz
ee
wig
an
acronym
for
what
you
see
be
what
you
get
what
you
saw
on
the
screen
be
what
you
d
get
when
you
print
it
out
the
hardware
team
scream
bloody
murder
atkinson
recall
they
say
it
would
force
us
to
use
a
phosphor
that
be
a
lot
less
persistent
and
would
flicker
more
so
atkinson
enlist
job
who
come
down
on
his
side
the
hardware
folk
grumble
but
then
go
off
and
figure
it
out
steve
wasn
t
much
of
an
engineer
himself
but
he
be
very
good
at
assess
people
s
answer
he
could
tell
whether
the
engineer
be
defensive
or
unsure
of
themselves
one
of
atkinson
s
amaze
feat
which
we
be
so
accustom
to
nowadays
that
we
rarely
marvel
at
it
be
to
allow
the
window
on
a
screen
to
overlap
so
that
the
top
one
clipped
into
the
one
below
it
atkinson
make
it
possible
to
move
these
window
around
just
like
shuffle
paper
on
a
desk
with
those
below
become
visible
or
hidden
as
you
move
the
top
one
of
course
on
a
computer
screen
there
be
no
layer
of
pixel
underneath
the
pixel
that
you
see
so
there
be
no
window
actually
lurk
underneath
the
one
that
appear
to
be
on
top
to
create
the
illusion
of
overlap
window
require
complex
cod
that
involves
what
be
call
region
atkinson
push
himself
to
make
this
trick
work
because
he
thought
he
have
see
this
capability
during
his
visit
to
xerox
parc
in
fact
the
folk
at
parc
have
never
accomplish
it
and
they
later
told
him
they
be
amaze
that
he
have
do
so
i
get
a
feel
for
the
empower
aspect
of
na
vet
atkinson
say
because
i
didn
t
know
it
couldn
t
be
do
i
be
enable
to
do
it
he
be
work
so
hard
that
one
morning
in
a
daze
he
drove
his
corvette
into
a
park
truck
and
nearly
kill
himself
job
immediately
drove
to
the
hospital
to
see
him
we
be
pretty
worried
about
you
he
say
when
atkinson
regain
consciousness
atkinson
give
him
a
pain
smile
and
reply
don
t
worry
i
still
remember
region
job
also
have
a
passion
for
smooth
scroll
document
should
not
lurch
line
by
line
as
you
scroll
through
them
but
instead
should
flow
he
be
adamant
that
everything
on
the
interface
have
a
good
feel
to
the
user
atkinson
say
they
also
want
a
mouse
that
could
easily
move
the
cursor
in
any
direction
not
just
up
down
left
right
this
require
use
a
ball
rather
than
the
usual
two
wheel
one
of
the
engineer
told
atkinson
that
there
be
no
way
to
build
such
a
mouse
commercially
after
atkinson
complain
to
job
over
dinner
he
arrive
at
the
office
the
next
day
to
discover
that
job
have
fire
the
engineer
when
his
replacement
met
atkinson
his
first
word
be
i
can
build
the
mouse
atkinson
and
job
become
best
friend
for
a
while
eat
together
at
the
good
earth
most
night
but
john
couch
and
the
other
professional
engineer
on
his
lisa
team
many
of
them
button
down
hp
type
resent
job
s
meddling
and
be
infuriate
by
his
frequent
insult
there
be
also
a
clash
of
vision
job
want
to
build
a
volkslisa
a
simple
and
inexpensive
product
for
the
mass
there
be
a
tug
of
war
between
people
like
me
who
want
a
lean
machine
and
those
from
hp
like
couch
who
be
aim
for
the
corporate
market
job
recall
both
mike
scott
and
mike
markkula
be
intent
on
bring
some
order
to
apple
and
become
increasingly
concerned
about
job
s
disruptive
behavior
so
in
september
they
secretly
plot
a
reorganization
couch

make
the
undisputed

it
meant
that
he
have
no

i
be
upset
and
felt
abandon
by

they
value
it
at
less
than
four
year
later
they
decide
it
be
time
to
take
it
public
it
would
become
the
most
oversubscribed
initial
public
offering
since
that

the
end
of

apple

billion
yes
billion
in
the

it
would
make
three
hundred
people
millionaire
daniel
kottke
be
not
one
of
them
he
have
be
job
s
soul
mate
in
college
in
india
at
the
all

when
it
be
headquarter
in
job
s
garage
and
he
still
work
there
as
an
hourly
employee
but
he
be
not
at
a
high
enough
level
to
be
cut
in
on
the
stock
option
that
be
award
before
the
ipo
i
totally
trust
steve
and
i
assume
he
would
take
care
of
me
like
i
d
take
care
of
him
so
i
didn
t
push
say
kottke
the
official
reason
he
wasn
t
give
stock
option
be
that
he
be
an
hourly
technician
not
a
salaried
engineer
which
be
the
cutoff
level
for
option
even
so
he
could
have
justifiably
be
give
founder
s
stock
but
job
decide
not
to
steve
be
the
opposite
of
loyal
accord
to
andy
hertz
feld
an
early
apple
engineer
who
have
nevertheless
remain
friend
with

he
s
anti
loyal
he
have
to
abandon
the
people
he
be
close
to

decide
to
press
his
case
with
job
by
hover
outside
his
office
and
catch
him
to
make
a
plea
but
at
each
encounter
job
brush
him
off
what
be
really
so
difficult
for
me
be
that
steve
never
told
me
i
wasn
t
eligible
recall
kottke
he
owe
me
that
as
a
friend
when
i
would
ask
him
about
stock
he
would
tell
me
i
have
to

to
my
manager

the
courage
to
march
into
job

try
to
hash
out
the
issue
but
when
he

be
so
cold
that
kottke
froze
i
just
get
choked
up
and
begin
to
cry
and
just
couldn

now
worth
million
baby
you
re
a

before

both
broke
and
a
billionaire
steve
job
s
attitude
toward
wealth
be
complex
he
be
an
antimaterialistic
hippie
who
capitalize
on
the
invention
of
a
friend
who
want
to
give
them
away
for
free
and
he
be
a
zen
devotee
who
make
a
pilgrimage
to
india
and
then
decide
that
his
call
be
to
create
a
business
and
yet
somehow
these
attitude
seem
to
weave
together
rather
than
conflict
he
have
a
great
love
for
some
material
object
especially
those
that
be
finely
design
and
craft
such
as
porsche
and
mercedes
car
henckels
knife

bmw
motorcycle
and
ansel
adam

yet
the
house
he
live
in
no
matter
how
rich
he
become
tend
not
to
be
ostentatious
and
be
furnish
so
simply
they
would
have
put
a
shaker
to
shame
neither
then
nor
later
would
he
travel
with
an
entourage
keep
a
personal
staff
or
even
have
security
protection
he
bought
a
nice
car
but
always
drove
himself
when
markkula
ask
job
to
join
him
in
buying
a
lear
jet
he
decline
though
he
eventually
would
demand
of
apple
a
gulfstream
to
use
like
his
father
he
could
be
flinty
when
bargaining
with
supplier
but
he
didn
t
allow
a
crave
for
profit
to
take
precedence
over
his
passion
for
building
great
product
thirty
year
after
apple
go
public
he
reflect
on
what
it
be
like
to
come
into
money
suddenly
i
never
worried
about
money
i
grow
up
in
a
middle
class
family
so
i
never
thought
i
would
starve
and
i
learn
at
atari
that
i
could
be
an
okay
engineer
so
i
always
knew
i
could
get
by
i
be
voluntarily
poor
when
i
be
in
college
and
india
and
i
live
a
pretty
simple
life
even
when
i
be
work
so
i
go
from
fairly
poor
which
be
wonderful
because
i
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
money
to
be
incredibly
rich
when
i
also
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
money
i
watch
people
at
apple
who
make
a
lot
of
money
and
felt
they
have
to
live
differently
some
of
them
bought
a
roll
royce
and
various
house
each

manage
the
house
manager
their
wife
get
plastic
surgery
and
turn
into
these
bizarre
people
this
be
not
how
i
want
to
live
it
s
crazy
i
make
a
promise
to
myself
that
i
m
not
go
to
let
this
money
ruin
my
life

out
everything
you

a

a

the

conclude
start
with
the
ability
desire
be
nonsense
we
must
start
both
with
a
price
goal
and
a
set
of
ability
and
keep
an
eye
on
today

and
the
immediate
future
s
technology
in
other
word
raskin
have
little
patience
for
job
s
belief
that
you
could
distort
reality
if
you
have
enough
passion
for
your
product
thus
they
be
destine
to
clash
especially
after
job
be
eject
from
the
lisa
project
in
september
and
begin
cast
around
for
someplace
else
to
make
his
mark
it
be
inevitable
that
his
gaze
would
fall
on
the
macintosh
project
raskin
s
manifesto
about
an
inexpensive
machine
for
the
mass
with
a
simple
graphic
interface
and
clean
design
stir
his
soul
and
it
be
also
inevitable
that
once
job
set
his
sight
on
the
macintosh
project
raskin
s
day
be
numbered
steve
start
act
on
what
he
thought
we
should
do
jef
start
brooding
and
it
instantly
be
clear
what
the
outcome
would
be
recall
joanna
hoffman
a
member
of
the
mac
team
the
first
conflict
be
over
raskin
s
devotion
to
the
underpowered
motorola
microprocessor
once
again
it
be
a
clash
between
raskin
s
desire
to
keep
the
mac
s
price
under
and
job
s
determination
to
build
an
insanely
great
machine
so
job
begin
push
for
the
mac
to
switch
to
the
more
powerful
motorola
which
be
what
the
lisa
be
use
just
before
christmas
he
challenged
burrell
smith
without
tell
raskin
to
make
a
redesign
prototype
that
use
the
more
powerful
chip
as
his
hero
wozniak
would
have
do
smith
threw
himself
into
the
task
around
the
clock
work
nonstop
for
three
week
and
employ
all
sort
of
breathtaking
program
leap
when
he
succeed
job
be
able
to
force
the
switch
to
the
motorola
and
raskin
have
to
brood
and
recalculate
the
cost
of
the
mac
there
be
something
large
at
stake
the
cheaper
microprocessor
that
raskin
want
would
not
have
be
able
to
accommodate
all
of
the
gee
whiz
graphic
window
menu
mouse
and
so
on
that
the
team
have
see
on
the
xerox
parc
visit
raskin
have
convince
everyone
to
go
to
xerox
parc
and
he
like
the
idea
of
a
bitmapped
display
and
window
but
he
be
not
as
charm
by
all
the
cute
graphic
and
icon
and
he
absolutely
detest
the
idea
of
use
a
point
and
click
mouse
rather
than
the
keyboard
some
of
the
people
on
the
project
become
enamor
of
the
quest
to
do
everything
with
the
mouse
he
later
grouse
another
example
be
the
absurd
application
of
icon
an
icon
be
a
symbol
equally
incomprehensible
in
all
human
language
there
s
a
reason
why
human
invent
phonetic
language
raskin
s
former
student
bill
atkinson
side
with
job
they
both
want
a
powerful
processor
that
could
support
whizzier
graphic
and
the
use
of
a
mouse
steve
have
to
take
the
project
away
from
jef
atkinson
say
jef
be
pretty
firm
and
stubborn
and
steve
be
right
to
take
it
over
the
world
get
a
well
result
the
disagreement
be
more
than
just
philosophical
they
become
clash
of
personality
i
think
that
he
like
people
to
jump
when
he
say
jump
raskin
once
say
i
felt
that
he
be
untrustworthy
and
that
he
do
not
take
kindly
to
be
found
want
he
doesn
t
seem
to
like
people
who
see
him
without
a
halo
job
be
equally
dismissive
of
raskin
jef
be
really
pompous
he
say
he
didn
t
know
much
about
interface
so
i
decide
to
nab
some
of
his
people
who
be
really
good
like
atkinson
bring
in
some
of
my
own
take
the
thing
over
and
build
a
less
expensive
lisa
not
some
piece
of
junk
some
on
the
team
found
job
impossible
to
work
with
job
seem
to
introduce
tension
politics
and
hassle
rather
than
enjoy
a
buffer
from
those
distraction
one
engineer
write
in
a
memo
to
raskin
in
december
i
thoroughly
enjoy
talk
with
him
and
i
admire
his
idea
practical
perspective
and
energy
but
i
just
don
t
feel
that
he
provide
the
trust
supportive
relaxed
environment
that
i
need
but
many
others
realize
that
despite
his
temperamental
failing
job
have
the
charisma
and
corporate
clout
that
would
lead
them
to
make
a
dent
in
the
universe
job
told
the
staff
that
raskin
be
just
a
dreamer
whereas
he
be
a
doer
and
would
get
the
mac
do
in
a
year
it
be
clear
he
want
vindication
for
have
be
oust
from
the
lisa
group
and
he
be
energize
by
competition
he
publicly
bet
john
couch
that
the
mac
would
ship
before
the
lisa
we
can
make
a
computer
that
s
cheaper
and
well
than
the
lisa
and
get
it
out
first
he
told
the
team
job
assert
his
control
of
the
group
by
cancel
a
brown
bag
lunch
seminar
that
raskin
be
schedule
to
give
to
the
whole
company
in
february
raskin
happen
to
go
by
the
room
anyway
and
discover
that
there
be
a
hundred
people
there
wait
to
hear
him
job
have
not
bother
to
notify
anyone
else
about
his
cancellation
order
so
raskin
go
ahead
and
give
a
talk
that
incident
lead
raskin
to
write
a
blistering
memo
to
mike
scott
who
once
again
found
himself
in
the
difficult
position
of
be
a
president
try
to
manage
a
company
s
temperamental
cofounder
and
major
stockholder
it
be
title
work
for
with
steve
job
and
in
it
raskin
assert
he
be
a
dreadful
manager
i
have
always
like
steve
but
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
work
for
him
job
regularly
miss
appointment
this
be
so
well
know
as
to
be
almost
a
run
joke
he
act
without
think
and
with
bad
judgment
he
do
not
give
credit
where
due
very
often
when
told
of
a
new
idea
he
will
immediately
attack
it
and
say
that
it
be
worthless
or
even
stupid
and
tell
you
that
it
be
a
waste
of
time
to
work
on
it
this
alone
be
bad
management
but
if
the
idea
be
a
good
one
he
will
soon
be
tell
people
about
it
as
though
it
be
his
own
that
afternoon
scott
call
in
job
and
raskin
for
a
showdown
in
front
of
markkula
job
start
cry
he
and
raskin
agree
on
only
one
thing
neither
could
work
for
the
other
one
on
the
lisa
project
scott
have
side
with
couch
this
time
he
decide
it
be
best
to
let
job
win
after
all
the
mac
be
a
minor
development
project
house
in
a
distant
building
that
could
keep
job
occupy
away
from
the
main
campus
raskin
be
told
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
they
want
to
humor
me
and
give
me
something
to
do
which
be
fine
job
recall
it
be
like
go
back
to
the
garage
for
me
i
have
my
own
ragtag
team
and
i
be
in
control
raskin
s
ouster
may
not
have
seem
fair
but
it
end
up
be
good
for
the
macintosh
raskin
want
an
appliance
with
little
memory
an
anemic
processor
a
cassette
tape
no
mouse
and
minimal
graphic
unlike
job
he
might
have
be
able
to
keep
the
price
down
to
close
to
and
that
may
have
help
apple
win
market
share
but
he
could
not
have
pull
off
what
job
do
which
be
to
create
and
market
a
machine
that
would
transform
personal
compute
in
fact
we
can
see
where
the
road
not
take
lead
raskin
be
hire
by
canon
to
build
the
machine
he
want
it
be
the
canon
cat
and
it
be
a
total
flop
atkinson
say
nobody
want
it
when
steve
turn
the
mac
into
a
compact
version
of
the
lisa
it
make
it
into
a
compute
platform
instead
of
a
consumer
electronic
device
texaco
tower
a
few
day
after
raskin
left
job
appear
at
the
cubicle
of
andy
hertzfeld
a
young
engineer
on
the
apple
ii
team
who
have
a
cherubic
face
and
impish
demeanor
similar
to
his
pal
burrell
smith
s
hertzfeld
recall
that
most
of
his
colleague
be
afraid
of
job
because
of
his
spontaneous
temper
tantrum
and
his
proclivity
to
tell
everyone
exactly
what
he
thought
which
often
wasn
t
very
favorable
but
hertzfeld
be
excite
by
him
be
you
any
good
job
ask
the
moment
he
walk
in
we
only
want
really
good
people
work
on
the
mac
and
i
m
not
sure
you
re
good
enough
hertzfeld
knew
how
to
answer

he
want
me
to
see
that
this
whole
thing
be
go
to
happen
and
it
be
thought
out
from
end
to
end
wow
i
say
i
don
t
see
that
kind
of
passion
every
day
so
i
sign
up
job
even
try
to
reengage
wozniak
i
resent
the
fact
that
he
have
not
be
do
much
but
then
i
thought
hell
i
wouldn
t
be
here
without
his
brilliance
job
later
told
me
but
as
soon
as
job
be
start
to
get
him
interested
in
the
mac
wozniak
crashed
his
new
single
engine
beechcraft
while
attempt
a
takeoff
near
santa
cruz
he
barely
survive
and
end
up
with
partial
amnesia
job
spent
time
at
the
hospital
but
when
wozniak
recover
he
decide
it
be
time
to
take
a
break
from
apple
ten
year
after
drop
out
of
berkeley
he
decide
to
return
there
to
finally
get
his
degree
enrol
under
the
name
of
rocky
raccoon
clark
in
order
to
make
the
project
his
own
job
decide
it
should
no
longer
be
code
name
after
raskin
s
favorite
apple
in
various
interview
job
have
be
refer
to
computer
as
a
bicycle
for
the
mind
the
ability
of
human
to
create
a
bicycle
allow
them
to
move
more
efficiently
than
even
a
condor
and
likewise
the
ability
to
create
computer
would
multiply
the
efficiency
of
their
mind
so
one
day
job
decreed
that
henceforth
the
macintosh
should
be
know
instead
as
the
bicycle
this
do
not
go
over
well
burrell
and
i
thought
this
be
the
silliest
thing
we
ever
heard
and
we
simply
refuse
to
use
the
new
name
recall
hertzfeld
within
a
month
the
idea
be
drop
by
early
the
mac
team
have
grown
to
about
twenty
and
job
decide
that
they
should
have
big
quarter
so
he
move
everyone
to
the
second
floor
of
a
brown
shingle
two
story
building
about
three
block
from
apple
s
main
office
it
be
next
to
a
texaco
station
and
thus
become
know
as
texaco
tower
in
order
to
make
the
office
more
lively
he
told
the
team
to
buy
a
stereo
system
burrell
and
i
ran
out
and
bought
a
silver
cassette
base
boom
box
right
away
before
he
could
change
his
mind
recall
hertzfeld
job
s
triumph
be
soon
complete
a
few
week
after
win
his
power
struggle
with
raskin
to
run
the
mac
division
he
help
push
out
mike
scott
as
apple
s
president
scotty
have
become
more
and
more
erratic
alternately
bullying
and
nurture
he
finally
lose
most
of
his
support
among
the
employee
when
he
surprised
them
by
impose
a
round
of
layoff
that
he
handle
with
atypical
ruthlessness
in
addition
he
have
begin
to
suffer
a
variety
of
affliction
range
from
eye
infection
to
narcolepsy
when
scott
be
on
vacation
in
hawaii
markkula
call
together
the
top
manager
to
ask
if
he
should
be
replace
most
of
them
include
job
and
john
couch
say
yes
so
markkula
take
over
as
an
interim
and
rather
passive
president
and
job
found
that
he
now
have
full
rein
to
do
what
he
want
with
the
mac
division
chapter
eleven
the
reality
distortion
field
play
by
his
own
set
of
rule
the
original

in
george
crow
joanna
hoffman
burrell
smith
andy
hertzfeld
bill
atkinson
and
jerry
manock
when
andy
hertzfeld
join
the
macintosh
team
he
get
a
briefing
from
bud
tribble
the
other
software
designer
about
the
huge
amount
of
work
that
still
need
to
be
do
job
want
it
finish
by
january
less
than
a
year
away
that
s
crazy
hertzfeld
say
there
s
no
way
tribble
say
that
job
would
not
accept
any
contrary
fact
the
best
way
to
describe
the
situation
be
a
term
from
star
trek
tribble
explain
steve
have
a
reality
distortion
field
when
hertzfeld
look
puzzle
tribble
elaborate
in
his
presence
reality
be
malleable
he
can
convince
anyone
of
practically
anything
it
wear
off
when
he
s
not
around
but
it
make
it
hard
to
have
realistic
schedule
tribble
recall
that
he
adopt
the
phrase
from
the
menagerie
episode
of
star
trek
in
which
the
alien
create
their
own
new
world
through
sheer
mental
force
he
meant
the
phrase
to
be
a
compliment
as
well
as
a
caution
it
be
dangerous
to
get
caught
in
steve
s
distortion
field
but
it
be
what
lead
him
to
actually
be
able
to
change
reality
at
first
hertzfeld
thought
that
tribble
be
exaggerate
but
after
two
week
of
work
with
job
he
become
a
keen
observer
of
the
phenomenon
the
reality
distortion
field
be
a
confound
m
lange
of
a
charismatic
rhetorical
style
indomitable
will
and
eagerness
to
bend
any
fact
to
fit
the
purpose
at
hand
he
say
there
be
little
that
could
shield
you
from
the
force
hertzfeld
discover
amazingly
the
reality
distortion
field
seem
to
be
effective
even
if
you
be
acutely
aware
of
it
we
would
often
discus
potential
technique
for
ground
it
but
after
a
while
most
of
us
give
up
accept
it
as
a
force
of
nature
after
job
decreed
that
the
soda
in
the
office
refrigerator
be
replace
by
odwalla
organic
orange
and
carrot
juice
someone
on
the
team
have
t
shirt
make
reality
distortion
field
they
say
on
the
front
and
on
the
back
it
s
in
the
juice
to
some
people
call
it
a
reality
distortion
field
be
just
a
clever
way
to
say
that
job
tend
to
lie
but
it
be
in
fact
a
more
complex
form
of
dissemble
he
would
assert
something
be
it
a
fact
about
world
history
or
a
recount
of
who
suggest
an
idea
at
a
meeting
without
even
consider
the
truth
it
come
from
willfully
defy
reality
not
only
to
others
but
to
himself
he
can
deceive
himself
say
bill
atkinson
it
allow
him
to
con
people
into
believe
his
vision
because
he
have
personally
embrace
and
internalize
it
a
lot
of
people
distort
reality
of
course
when
job
do
so
it
be
often
a
tactic
for
accomplish
something
wozniak
who
be
as
congenitally
honest
as
job
be
tactical
marvel
at
how
effective
it
could
be
his
reality
distortion
be
when
he
have
an
illogical
vision
of
the
future
such
as
tell
me
that
i
could
design
the
breakout
game
in
just
a
few
day
you
realize
that
it
can
t
be
true
but
he
somehow
make
it
true
when
member
of
the
mac
team
get
ensnare
in
his
reality
distortion
field
they
be
almost
hypnotize
he
remind
me
of
rasputin
say
debi
coleman
he
laser
beam
in
on
you
and
didn
t
blink
it
didn
t
matter
if
he
be
serve
purple
kool
aid
you
drank
it
but
like
wozniak
she
believe
that
the
reality
distortion
field
be
empower
it
enable
job
to
inspire
his
team
to
change
the
course
of
computer
history
with
a
fraction
of
the
resource
of
xerox
or
ibm
it
be
a
self
fulfil
distortion
she
claimed
you
do
the
impossible
because
you
didn
t
realize
it
be
impossible
at
the
root
of
the
reality
distortion
be
job
s
belief
that
the
rule
didn
t
apply
to
him
he
have
some
evidence
for
this
in
his
childhood
he
have
often
be
able
to
bend
reality
to
his
desire
rebelliousness
and
willfulness
be
ingrain
in
his
character
he
have
the
sense
that
he
be
special
a
chosen
one
an
enlighten
one
he
think
there
be
a
few
people
who
be
special
people
like
einstein
and
gandhi
and
the
guru
he
met
in
india
and
he
s
one
of
them
say
hertzfeld
he
told
chrisann
this
once
he
even
hint
to
me
that
he
be
enlighten
it
s
almost
like
nietzsche
job
never
study
nietzsche
but
the
philosopher
s
concept
of
the
will
to
power
and
the
special
nature
of
the
berman
come
naturally
to
him
as
nietzsche
write
in
thus
spoke
zarathustra
the
spirit
now
will
his
own
will
and
he
who
have
be
lose
to
the
world
now
conquers
the
world
if
reality
do
not
comport
with
his
will
he
would
ignore
it
as
he
have
do
with
the
birth
of
his
daughter
and
would
do
year
later
when
first
diagnose
with
cancer
even
in
small
everyday
rebellion
such
as
not
put
a
license
plate
on
his
car
and
parking
it
in
handicapped
space
he
act
as
if
he
be
not
subject
to
the
stricture
around
him
another
key
aspect
of
job
s
worldview
be
his
binary
way
of
categorize
thing
people
be
either
enlighten
or
an
asshole
their
work
be
either
the
best
or
totally
shitty
bill
atkinson
the
mac
designer
who
fell
on
the
good
side
of
these
dichotomy
described
what
it
be
like
it
be
difficult
work
under
steve
because
there
be
a
great
polarity
between
god
and
shithead
if
you
be
a
god
you
be
up
on
a
pedestal
and
could
do
no
wrong
those
of
us
who
be
consider
to
be
god
as
i
be
knew
that
we
be
actually
mortal
and
make
bad
engineering
decision
and
fart
like
any
person
so
we
be
always
afraid
that
we
would
get
knock
off
our
pedestal
the
one
who
be
shithead
who
be
brilliant
engineer
work
very
hard
felt
there
be
no
way
they
could
get
appreciate
and
rise
above
their
status
but
these
category
be
not
immutable

tribble
specifically
warn
him
about
job
s
tendency
to
resemble
high
voltage
alternate
current
just
because
he
tell
you
that
something
be
awful
or

it
doesn

necessarily

he

tomorrow
tribble
explain
if
you
tell
him
a
new
idea
he
ll
usually
tell
you
that
he
think
it
s
stupid
but
then
if
he
actually
like
it
exactly
one
week
later
he
ll
come
back
to
you
and
propose
your
idea
to
you
as
if
he
thought
of
it
the
audacity
of
this
pirouette
technique
would
have
dazzle
diaghilev
if
one
line
of
argument
fail
to
persuade
he
would
deftly
switch
to
another
hertzfeld
say
sometimes
he
would
throw
you
off
balance
by
suddenly
adopt
your
position
as
his
own
without
acknowledge
that
he
ever
thought
differently
that
happen
repeatedly
to
bruce
horn
the
programmer
who
with
tesler
have
be
lure
from
xerox
parc
one
week
i
d
tell
him
about
an
idea
that
i
have
and
he
would
say
it
be
crazy
recall
horn
the
next
week
he
d
come
and
say
hey
i
have
this
great
idea
and
it
would
be
my
idea
you
d
call
him
on
it
and
say
steve
i
told
you
that
a
week
ago
and
he
d
say
yeah
yeah
yeah
and
just
move
right
along
it
be
as
if
job
s
brain
circuit
be
miss
a
device
that
would
modulate
the
extreme
spike
of
impulsive
opinion
that
popped
into
his
mind
so
in
deal
with
him
the
mac
team
adopt
an
audio
concept
call
a
low
pas
filter
in
processing
his
input
they
learn
to
reduce
the
amplitude
of
his
high
frequency
signal
that
serve
to
smooth
out
the
data
set
and
provide
a
less
jittery
move
average
of
his
evolve
attitude
after
a
few
cycle
of
him
take
alternate
extreme
position
say
hertzfeld
we
would
learn
to
low
pas
filter
his
signal
and
not
react
to
the
extreme
be
job
s
unfiltered
behavior
cause
by
a
lack
of
emotional
sensitivity
no
almost
the
opposite
he
be
very
emotionally
attune
able
to
read
people
and
know
their
psychological
strength
and
vulnerability
he
could
stun
an
unsuspecting
victim
with
an
emotional
towel
snap
perfectly
aim
he
intuitively
knew
when
someone
be
fake
it
or
truly
knew
something
this
make
him
masterful
at
cajole
stroke
persuade
flatter
and
intimidate
people
he
have
the
uncanny
capacity
to
know
exactly
what
your
weak
point
be
know
what
will
make
you
feel
small
to
make
you
cringe
joanna
hoffman
say
it
s
a
common
trait
in
people
who
be
charismatic
and
know
how
to
manipulate
people
know
that
he
can
crush
you
make
you
feel
weaken
and
eager
for
his
approval
so
then
he
can
elevate
you
and
put
you
on
a
pedestal
and
own
you
ann
bower
become

perfectionism
petulance
and
prickliness
she
have
be

resource
director
at

but
have
step
aside
after
she
married
its
cofounder
bob
noyce
she
join
apple
in
and
serve
as
a
calm
mother
figure
who
would
step
in
after
one
of
job
s
tantrum
she
would
go
to
his
office
shut
the
door
and
gently
lecture
him
i
know
i
know
he
would
say
well
then
please
stop
do
it
she
would
insist
bower
recall
he
would
be
good
for
a
while
and
then
a
week
or
so
later
i
would
get
a
call
again
she
realize
that
he
could
barely
contain
himself
he
have
these
huge
expectation
and
if
people
didn
t
deliver
he
couldn
t
stand
it
he
couldn
t
control
himself
i
could
understand
why
steve
would
get
upset
and
he
be
usually
right
but
it
have
a
hurtful
effect
it
create
a
fear
factor
he
be
self
aware
but
that
didn
t
always
modify
his
behavior
job
become
close
to
bower
and
her
husband
and
he
would
drop
in
at
their
los
gatos
hill
home
unannounced
she
would
hear
his
motorcycle
in
the
distance
and
say
i
guess
we
have
steve
for
dinner
again
for
a
while
she
and
noyce
be
like
a
surrogate
family
he
be
so
bright
and
also
so
needy
he
need
a
grown
up
a
father
figure
which
bob
become
and
i
become
like
a
mother
figure
there
be
some
upside
to
job
s
demand
and
wound
behavior
people
who
be
not
crush
end
up
be
strong
they
do
well
work
out
of
both
fear
and
an
eagerness
to
please
his
behavior
can
be
emotionally
drain
but
if
you
survive
it
work
hoffman
say
you
could
also
push
back
sometimes
and
not
only
survive
but
thrive
that
didn
t
always
work
raskin
try
it
succeed
for
a
while
and
then
be
destroyed
but
if
you
be
calmly
confident
if
job
size
you
up
and
decide
that
you
knew
what
you
be
do
he
would
respect
you
in
both
his
personal
and
his
professional
life
over
the
year
his
inner
circle
tend
to
include
many
more
strong
people
than
toady
the
mac
team
knew
that
every
year
begin
in
it
give
out
an
award
to
the
person
who
do
the
best
job
of
stand
up
to
him
the
award
be
partly
a
joke
but
also
partly
real
and
job
knew
about
it
and
like
it
joanna
hoffman
won
the
first
year
from
an
eastern
european
refugee
family
she
have
a
strong
temper
and
will
one
day
for
example
she
discover
that
job
have
change
her
marketing
projection
in
a
way
she
found
totally
reality
distort
furious
she
march
to
his
office
as
i
m
climb
the
stair
i
told
his
assistant
i
be
go
to
take
a
knife
and
stab
it
into
his
heart
she
recount
al
eisenstat
the
corporate
counsel
come
run
out
to
restrain
her
but
steve
heard
me
out
and
back
down
hoffman
won
the
award
again
in
i
remember
be
envious
of
joanna
because
she
would
stand
up
to
steve
and
i
didn
t
have
the
nerve
yet
say
debi
coleman
who
join
the
mac
team
that
year
then
in
i
get
the
award
i
have
learn
you
have
to
stand
up
for
what
you
believe
which
steve
respect
i
start
get
promote
by
him
after
that
eventually
she
rise
to
become
head
of
manufacturing
one
day
job
barge
into
the
cubicle
of
one
of
atkinson
s
engineer
and
uttered
his
usual
this
be
shit
as
atkinson
recall
the
guy
say
no
it
s
not
it
s
actually
the
best
way
and
he
explain
to
steve
the
engineering
trade
offs
he
d
make
job
back
down
atkinson
taught
his
team
to
put
job
s
word
through
a
translator
we
learn
to
interpret
this
be
shit
to
actually
be
a
question
that
mean
tell
me
why
this
be
the
best
way
to
do
it
but
the
story
have
a
coda
which
atkinson
also
found
instructive
eventually
the
engineer
found
an
even
well
way
to
perform
the
function
that
job
have
criticize
he
do
it
well
because
steve
have
challenged
him
say
atkinson
which
show
you
can
push
back
on
him
but
should
also
listen
for
he
s
usually
right
job
s
prickly
behavior
be
partly
driven
by
his
perfectionism
and
his
impatience
with
those
who
make
compromise
in
order
to
get
a
product
out
on
time
and
on
budget
he
could
not
make
trade
offs
well
say
atkinson
if
someone
didn
t
care
to
make
their
product
perfect
they
be
a
bozo
at
the
west
coast
computer
faire
in
april
for
example
adam
osborne
release
the
first
truly
portable
personal
computer
it
be
not
great
it
have
a
five
inch
screen
and
not
much
memory
but
it
work
well
enough
as
osborne
famously
declare
adequacy
be
sufficient
all
else
be
superfluous
job
found
that
approach
to
be
morally
appal
and
he
spent
day
make
fun
of
osborne
this
guy
just
doesn
t
get
it
job
repeatedly
rail
as
he
wander
the
apple
corridor
he
s
not
make
art
he
s
make
shit
one
day
job
come
into
the
cubicle
of
larry
kenyon
an
engineer
who
be
work
on
the
macintosh
operating
system
and
complain
that
it
be
take
too
long
to
boot
up
kenyon
start
to
explain
but
job
cut
him
off
if
it
could
save
a
person
s
life
would
you
find
a
way
to
shave
ten
second
off
the
boot
time
he
ask
kenyon
allow
that
he
probably
could
job
go
to
a
whiteboard
and
show
that
if
there
be
five
million
people
use
the
mac
and
it
take
ten
second
extra
to
turn
it
on
every
day
that
add
up
to
three
hundred
million
or
so
hour
per
year
that
people
would
save
which
be
the
equivalent
of
at
least
one
hundred
lifetime
save
per
year
larry
be
suitably
impressed
and
a
few
week
later
he
come
back
and
it
boot
up
twenty
eight
second
faster
atkinson
recall
steve
have
a
way
of
motivate
by
look
at
the
big
picture
the
result
be
that
the
macintosh
team
come
to
share
job
s
passion
for
make
a
great
product
not
just
a
profitable
one
job
thought
of
himself
as
an
artist
and
he
encourage
the
design
team
to
think
of
ourselves
that
way
too
say
hertzfeld
the
goal
be
never
to
beat
the
competition
or
to
make
a
lot
of
money
it
be
to
do
the
great
thing
possible
or
even
a
little
great
he
once
take
the
team
to
see
an
exhibit
of
tiffany
glass
at
the
metropolitan
museum
in
manhattan
because
he
believe
they
could
learn
from
louis
tiffany
s
example
of
create
great
art
that
could
be
mass
produce
recall
bud
tribble
we
say
to
ourselves
hey
if
we
re
go
to
make
thing
in
our
life
we
might
as
well
make
them
beautiful
be
all
of
his
stormy
and
abusive
behavior
necessary
probably
not
nor
be
it
justified
there
be
other
way
to
have
motivate
his
team
even
though
the
macintosh
would
turn
out
to
be
great
it
be
way
behind
schedule
and
way
over
budget
because
of
job
s
impetuous
intervention
there
be
also
a
cost
in
brutalize
human
feeling
which
cause
much
of
the
team
to
burn
out
steve
s
contribution
could
have
be
make
without
so
many
story
about
him
terrorize
folk
wozniak
say
i
like
be
more
patient
and
not
have
so
many
conflict
i
think
a
company
can
be
a
good
family
if
the
macintosh
project
have
be
run
my
way
thing
probably
would
have
be
a
mess
but
i
think
if
it
have
be
a
mix
of
both
our
style
it
would
have
be
well
than
just
the
way
steve
do
it
but
even
though
job
s
style
could
be
demoralize
it
could
also
be
oddly
inspire
it
infuse
apple
employee
with
an
abide
passion
to
create
groundbreaking
product
and
a
belief
that
they
could
accomplish
what
seem
impossible
they
have
t
shirt
make
that
read
hour
a
week
and
love
it
out
of
a
fear
of
job
mixed
with
an
incredibly
strong
urge
to
impress
him
they
exceed
their
own
expectation
i
ve
learn
over
the
year
that
when
you
have
really
good
people
you
don
t
have
to
baby
them
job
later
explain
by
expect
them
to
do
great
thing
you
can
get
them
to
do
great
thing
the
original
mac
team
taught
me
that
a
plus
player
like
to
work
together
and
they
don
t
like
it
if
you
tolerate
b
work
ask
any
member
of
that
mac
team
they
will
tell
you
it
be
worth
the
pain
most
of
them
agree
he
would
shout
at
a
meeting
you
asshole
you
never
do
anything
right
debi
coleman
recall
it
be
like
an
hourly
occurrence
yet
i
consider
myself
the
absolute
lucky
person
in
the
world
to
have
work
with
him
chapter
twelve
the
design
real
artist
simplify
a
bauhaus
aesthetic
unlike
most
kid
who
grow
up
in
eichler
home
job
knew
what
they
be
and
why
they
be
so
wonderful
he
like
the
notion
of
simple
and
clean
modernism
produce
for
the
mass
he
also
love
listen
to
his
father
describe
the
style
intricacy
of
various
car
so
from
the
begin
at
apple
he
believe
that
great
industrial
design
a
colorfully
simple
logo
a
sleek
case
for
the
apple
ii
would
set
the
company
apart
and
make
its
product
distinctive
the
company
s
first
office
after
it
move
out
of
his
family
garage
be
in
a
small
building
it
share
with
a
sony
sale
office
sony
be
famous
for
its
signature
style
and
memorable
product
design
so
job
would
drop
by
to
study
the
marketing
material
he
would
come
in
look
scruffy
and
fondle
the
product
brochure
and
point
out
design
feature
say
dan
l
lewin
who
work
there
every
now
and
then
he
would
ask
can
i
take
this
brochure
by
he
have
hire
lewin
his
fondness
for
the
dark
industrial
look
of
sony
recede
around
june
when
he
begin
attend
the
annual
international
design
conference
in
aspen
the
meeting
that
year
focus
on
italian
style
and
it
feature
the
architect
designer
mario
bellini
the
filmmaker
bernardo
bertolucci
the
car
maker
sergio
pininfarina
and
the
fiat
heiress
and
politician
susanna
agnelli
i
have
come
to
revere
the
italian
designer
just
like
the
kid
in
break
away
revere
the
italian
bikers
recall
job
so
it
be
an
amaze
inspiration
in
aspen
he
be
expose
to
the
spare
and
functional
design
philosophy
of
the
bauhaus
movement
which
be
enshrine
by
herbert
bayer
in
the
building
living
suite
sans
serif
font
typography
and
furniture
on
the
aspen
institute
campus
like
his
mentor
walter
gropius
and
ludwig
mies
van
der
rohe
bayer
believe
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
fine
art
and
apply
industrial
design
the
modernist
international
style
champion
by
the
bauhaus
taught
that
design
should
be
simple
yet
have
an
expressive
spirit
it
emphasize
rationality
and
functionality
by
employ
clean
line
and
form
among
the
maxim
preach
by
mies
and
gropius
be
god
be
in
the
detail
and
less
be
more
as
with
eichler
home
the
artistic
sensibility
be
combine
with
the
capability
for
mass
production
job
publicly
discuss
his
embrace
of
the
bauhaus
style
in
a
talk
he
give
at
the
design
conference
the
theme
of
which
be
the
future
isn
t
what
it
use
to
be
he
predict
the
passing
of
the
sony
style
in
favor
of
bauhaus
simplicity
the
current
wave
of
industrial
design
be
sony
s
high
tech
look
which
be
gunmetal
gray
maybe
paint
it
black
do
weird
stuff
to
it
he
say
it
s
easy
to
do
that
but
it
s
not
great
he
propose
an
alternative
born
of
the
bauhaus
that
be
more
true
to
the
function
and
nature
of
the
product
what
we
re
go
to
do
be
make
the
product
high
tech
and
we
re
go
to
package
them
cleanly
so
that
you
know
they
re
high
tech
we
will
fit
them
in
a
small
package
and
then
we
can
make
them
beautiful
and
white
just
like
braun
do
with
its
electronics
he
repeatedly
emphasize
that
apple
s
product
would
be
clean
and
simple
we
will
make
them
bright
and
pure
and
honest
about
be
high
tech
rather
than
a
heavy
industrial
look
of
black
black
black
black
like
sony
he
preach
so
that
s
our
approach
very
simple
and
we
re
really
shoot
for
museum
of
modern
art
quality
the
way
we
re
run
the
company
the
product
design
the
advertising
it
all
come
down
to
this
let
s
make
it
simple
really
simple
apple
s
design
mantra
would
remain
the
one
feature
on
its
first
brochure
simplicity
be
the
ultimate
sophistication
job
felt
that
design
simplicity
should
be
link
to
make
product
easy
to
use
those
goal
do
not
always
go
together
sometimes
a
design
can
be
so
sleek
and
simple
that
a
user
find
it
intimidate
or
unfriendly
to
navigate
the
main
thing
in
our
design
be
that
we
have
to
make
thing
intuitively
obvious
job
told
the
crowd
of
design
maven
for
example
he
extol
the
desktop
metaphor
he
be
create
for
the
macintosh
people
know
how
to
deal
with
a
desktop
intuitively
if
you
walk
into
an
office
there
be
paper
on
the
desk
the
one
on
the
top
be
the
most
important
people
know
how
to
switch
priority
part
of
the
reason
we
model
our
computer
on
metaphor
like
the
desktop
be
that
we
can
leverage
this
experience
people
already
have
speak
at
the
same
time
as
job
that
wednesday
afternoon
but
in
a
small
seminar
room
be
maya
lin
twenty
three
who
have
be
catapult
into
fame
the
previous
november
when
her
vietnam
veteran
memorial
be
dedicate
in
washington
d
c
they
struck
up
a
close
friendship
and
job
invite
her
to
visit
apple
i
come
to
work
with
steve
for
a
week
lin
recall
i
ask
him
why
do
computer
look
like
clunky
tv
set
why
don
t
you
make
something
thin
why
not
a
flat
laptop
job
reply
that
this
be
indeed
his
goal
as
soon
as
the
technology
be
ready
at
that
time
there
be
not
much
excite
happen
in
the
realm
of
industrial
design
job
felt
he
have
a
richard
sapper
lamp
which
he
admire
and
he
also
like
the
furniture
of
charles
and
ray
eames
and
the
braun
product
of
dieter
ram
but
there
be
no
tower
figure
energize
the
world
of
industrial
design
the
way
that
raymond
loewy
and
herbert
bayer
have
do
there
really
wasn
t
much
go
on
in
industrial
design
particularly
in
silicon
valley
and
steve
be
very
eager
to
change
that
say
lin
his
design
sensibility
be
sleek
but
not
slick
and
it
s
playful
he
embrace
minimalism
which
come
from
his
zen
devotion
to
simplicity
but
he
avoid
allow
that
to
make
his
product
cold
they
stayed
fun
he
s
passionate
and
super
serious
about
design
but
at
the
same
time
there
s
a
sense
of
play
as
job
s
design
sensibility
evolve
he
become
particularly
attract
to
the
japanese
style
and
begin
hang
out
with
its
star
such
as
issey
miyake
and
i
m
pei
his
buddhist
training
be
a
big
influence
i
have
always
found
buddhism
japanese
zen
buddhism
in
particular
to
be
aesthetically
sublime
he
say
the
most
sublime
thing
i
ve
ever
see
be
the
garden
around
kyoto
i
m
deeply
move
by
what
that
culture
have
produce
and
it
s
directly
from
zen
buddhism
like
a
porsche
jef
raskin
s
vision
for
the
macintosh
be
that
it
would
be
like
a
boxy
carry
on
suitcase
which
would
be
close
by
flip
up
the
keyboard
over
the
front
screen
when
job
take
over
the
project
he
decide
to
sacrifice
portability
for
a
distinctive
design
that
wouldn
t
take
up
much
space
on
a
desk
he
plopped
down
a
phone
book
and
declare
to
the
horror
of
the
engineer
that
it
shouldn
t
have
a
footprint
large
than
that
so
his
design
team
of
jerry
manock
and
terry
oyama
begin
work
on
idea
that
have
the
screen
above
the
computer
box
with
a
keyboard
that
be
detachable
one
day
in
march
andy
hertzfeld
come
back
to
the
office
from
dinner
to
find
job
hover
over
their
one
mac
prototype
in
intense
discussion
with
the
creative
service
director
james
ferris
we
need
it
to
have
a
classic
look
that
won
t
go
out
of
style
like
the
volkswagen
beetle
job
say
from
his
father
he
have
developed
an
appreciation
for
the
contour
of
classic
car
no
that
s
not
right
ferris
reply
the
line
should
be
voluptuous
like
a
ferrari
not
a
ferrari
that
s
not
right
either
job
counter
it
should
be
more
like
a
porsche
job
own
a
porsche
at
the
time
when
bill
atkinson
be
over
one
weekend
job
brought
him
outside
to
admire
the
car
great
art
stretch
the
taste
it
doesn
t
follow
taste
he
told
atkinson
he
also
admire
the
design
of
the
mercedes
over
the
year
they
ve
make
the
line
softer
but
the
detail
starker
he
say
one
day
as
he
walk
around
the
parking
lot
that
s
what
we
have
to
do
with
the
macintosh
oyama
draft
a
preliminary
design
and
have
a
plaster
model
make
the
mac
team
gather
around
for
the
unveil
and
express
their
thought
hertzfeld
call
it
cute
others
also
seem
satisfied
then
job
let
loose
a
blistering
burst
of
criticism
it
s
way
too
boxy
it
s
get
to
be
more
curvaceous
the
radius
of
the
first
chamfer
need
to
be
big
and
i
don
t
like
the
size
of
the
bevel
with
his
new
fluency
in
industrial
design
lingo
job
be
refer
to
the
angular
or
curve
edge
connect
the
side
of
the
computer
but
then
he
give
a
resound
compliment
it
s
a
start
he
say
every
month
or
so
manock
and
oyama
would
present
a
new
iteration
base
on
job
s
previous
criticism
the
late
plaster
model
would
be
dramatically
unveiled
and
all
the
previous
attempt
would
be
line
up
next
to
it
that
not
only
help
them
gauge
the
design
s
evolution
but
it
prevent
job
from
insist
that
one
of
his
suggestion
have
be
ignore
by
the
fourth
model
i
could
barely
distinguish
it
from
the
third
one
say
hertzfeld
but
steve
be
always
critical
and
decisive
say
he
love
or
hat
a
detail
that
i
could
barely
perceive
one
weekend
job
go
to
macy
s
in
palo
alto
and
again
spent
time
study
appliance
especially
the
cuisinart
he
come
bound
into
the
mac
office
that
monday
ask
the
design
team
to
go
buy
one
and
make
a
raft
of
new
suggestion
base
on
its
line
curve
and
bevel
job
kept
insist
that
the
machine
should
look
friendly
as
a
result
it
evolve
to
resemble
a
human
face
with
the
disk
drive
built
in
below
the
screen
the
unit
be
taller
and
narrower
than
most
computer
suggest
a
head
the
recess
near
the
base
evoke
a
gentle
chin
and
job
narrow
the
strip
of
plastic
at
the
top
so
that
it
avoid
the
neanderthal
forehead
that
make
the
lisa
subtly
unattractive
the
patent
for
the
design
of
the
apple
case
be
issue
in
the
name
of
steve
job
as
well
as
manock
and
oyama
even
though
steve
didn
t
draw
any
of
the
line
his
idea
and
inspiration
make
the
design
what
it
be
oyama
later
say
to
be
honest
we
didn
t
know
what
it
meant
for
a
computer
to
be
friendly
until
steve
told
us
job
obsess
with
equal
intensity
about
the
look
of
what
would
appear
on
the
screen
one
day
bill
atkinson
burst
into
texaco
tower
all
excite
he
have
just
come
up
with
a
brilliant
algorithm
that
could
draw
circle
and
oval
onscreen
quickly
the
math
for
make
circle
usually
require
calculate
square
root
which
the
microprocessor
didn
t
support
but
atkinson
do
a
workaround
base
on
the
fact
that
the
sum
of
a
sequence
of
odd
number
produce
a
sequence
of
perfect
square
for
example
etc
hertzfeld
recall
that
when
atkinson
fire
up
his
demo
everyone
be
impressed
except
job
well
circle
and
oval
be
good
he
say
but
how
about
draw
rectangle
with
round
corner
i
don
t
think
we
really
need
it
say
atkinson
who
explain
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
do
i
want
to
keep
the
graphic
routine
lean
and
limit
them
to
the
primitive
that
truly
need
to
be
do
he
recall
rectangle
with
round
corner
be
everywhere
job
say
jumping
up
and
get
more
intense
just
look
around
this
room
he
point
out
the
whiteboard
and
the
tabletop
and
other
object
that
be
rectangular
with
round
corner
and
look
outside
there
s
even
more
practically
everywhere
you
look
he
drag
atkinson
out
for
a
walk
point
out
car
window
and
billboard
and
street
sign
within
three
block
we
found
seventeen
example
say
job
i
start
point
them
out
everywhere
until
he
be
completely
convince
when
he
finally
get
to
a
no
parking
sign
i
say
okay
you
re
right
i
give
up
we
need
to
have
a
round
corner
rectangle
as
a
primitive
hertzfeld
recall
bill
return
to
texaco
tower
the
follow
afternoon
with
a
big
smile
on
his
face
his

one
of
the
most
extreme
and
tell

when

deep
inside

year
later
after

that
lesson
from
his
father
when
you
re
a

make
a
beautiful
chest
of
drawer
you
re

nobody
will
ever

he
have
be
oust
from
that
group
and
now
he
want
to
beat
it
he
also
saw
healthy
rivalry
as
a
way
to
motivate
his
troop
that
s
why
he
bet
john
couch
that
the
mac
would
ship
before
the
lisa
the
problem
be
that
the
rivalry
become
unhealthy
job
repeatedly
portrayed
his
band
of
engineer
as
the
cool
kid
on
the
block
in
contrast
to
the
plod
hp
engineer
type
work
on
the
lisa
more
substantively
when
he
move
away
from
jef
raskin
s
plan
for
an
inexpensive
and
underpowered
portable
appliance
and
reconceived
the
mac
as
a
desktop
machine
with
a
graphical
user
interface
it
become
a
scale
down
version
of
the
lisa
that
would
likely
undercut
it
in
the
marketplace
larry
tesler
who
manage
application
software
for
the
lisa
realize
that
it
would
be
important
to
design
both
machine
to
use
many
of
the
same
software
program
so
to
broker
peace
he
arrange
for
smith
and
hertzfeld
to
come
to
the
lisa
work
space
and
demonstrate
the
mac
prototype
twenty
five
engineer
show
up
and
be
listen
politely
when
halfway
into
the
presentation
the
door
burst
open
it
be
rich
page
a
volatile
engineer
who
be
responsible
for
much
of
the
lisa
s
design
the
macintosh
be
go
to
destroy
the
lisa
he
shout
the
macintosh
be
go
to
ruin
apple
neither
smith
nor
hertzfeld
respond
so
page
continued
his
rant
job
want
to
destroy
lisa
because
we
wouldn
t
let
him
control
it
he
say
look
as
if
he
be
about
to
cry
nobody
s
go
to
buy
a
lisa
because
they
know
the
mac
be
come
but
you
don
t
care
he
storm
out
of
the
room
and
slam
the
door
but
a
moment
later
he
barge
back
in
briefly
i
know
it
s
not
your
fault
he
say
to
smith
and
hertzfeld
steve
job
be
the
problem
tell
steve
that
he
s
destroy
apple
job
do
indeed
make
the
macintosh
into
a
low
cost
competitor
to
the
lisa
one
with
incompatible
software
make
matter
bad
be
that
neither
machine
be
compatible
with
the
apple
ii
with
no
one
in
overall
charge
at
apple
there
be
no
chance
of
keep
job
in
harness
end
to
end
control
job
s
reluctance
to
make
the
mac
compatible
with
the
architecture
of
the
lisa
be
motivate
by
more
than
rivalry
or
revenge
there
be
a
philosophical
component
one
that
be
related
to
his
penchant
for
control
he
believe
that
for
a
computer
to
be
truly
great
its
hardware
and
its
software
have
to
be
tightly
link
when
a
computer
be
open
to
run
software
that
also
work
on
other
computer
it
would
end
up
sacrifice
some
functionality
the
best
product
he
believe
be
whole
widget
that
be
design
end
to
end
with
the
software
closely
tailor
to
the
hardware
and
vice
versa
this
be
what
would
distinguish
the
macintosh
which
have
an
operating
system
that
work
only
on
its
own
hardware
from
the
environment
that
microsoft
be
create
in
which
its
operating
system
could
be
use
on
hardware

by
many
different

inauspiciously
by

explain
zdnet

it
would
be
as
if
someone
off
the
street
add
some
brush
stroke
to
a
picasso
painting
or
change
the
lyric
to
a

in

year
job
s
whole

approach
would
distinguish
the
iphone
ipod
and
ipad
from

competitor
it
result
in
awesome
product
but
it
be
not
always
the
best
strategy
for
dominate
a

kahney
author
of
cult
of
the
mac
job
s
desire
to
control
the
user
experience
have
be
at
the
heart
of
his
debate
with
wozniak
over
whether
the
apple
ii
would
have
slot
that
allow
a
user
to
plug
expansion
card
into
a
computer
s
motherboard
and
thus
add
some
new
functionality
wozniak
won
that
argument
the
apple
ii
have
eight
slot
but
this
time
around
it
would
be
job
s
machine
not
wozniak
s
and
the
macintosh
would
have
limited
slot
you
wouldn
t
even
be
able
to
open
the
case
and
get
to
the
motherboard
for
a
hobbyist
or
hacker
that
be
uncool
but
for
job
the
macintosh
be
for
the
mass
he
want
to
give
them
a
control
experience

reflect
his
personality
which
be
to
want
control

who
be
hire
by
job
in
to
be
a
market
strategist
at
texaco
tower
steve
would
talk
about
the
apple
ii
and
complain
we
don
t
have
control
and
look
at
all
these
crazy
thing
people
be
try
to
do
to
it
that
s
a
mistake
i
ll
never
make
again
he
go
so
far
as
to
design
special
tool
so
that
the
macintosh
case
could
not
be
open
with
a
regular
screwdriver
we
re
go
to
design
this
thing
so
nobody
but
apple
employee
can
get
inside
this
box
he
told
cash
job
also
decide
to
eliminate
the
cursor
arrow
key
on
the
macintosh
keyboard
the
only
way
to
move
the
cursor
be
to
use
the
mouse
it
be
a
way
of
force
old
fashion
user
to
adapt
to
point
and
click
navigation
even
if
they
didn
t
want
to
unlike
other
product
developer
job
do
not
believe
the
customer
be
always
right
if
they
want
to
resist
use
a
mouse
they
be
wrong
there
be
one
other
advantage
he
believe
to
eliminate
the
cursor
key
it
force
outside
software
developer
to
write
program
specially
for
the
mac
operating
system
rather
than
merely
write
generic
software
that
could
be
port
to
a
variety
of
computer
that
make
for
the
type
of
tight
vertical
integration
between
application
software
operating
system
and
hardware
device
that
job
like
job
s
desire
for
end
to
end
control
also
make
him
allergic
to
proposal
that
apple
license
the
macintosh
operating
system
to
other
office
equipment
manufacturer
and
allow
them
to
make
macintosh
clone
the
new
and
energetic
macintosh
marketing
director
mike
murray
propose
a
licensing
program
in
a
confidential
memo
to
job
in
may
we
would
like
the
macintosh
user
environment
to
become
an
industry
standard
he
write
the
hitch
of
course
be
that
now
one
must
buy
mac
hardware
in
order
to
get
this
user
environment
rarely
if
ever
have
one
company
be
able
to
create
and
maintain
an
industry
wide
standard
that
cannot
be
share
with
other
manufacturer
his
proposal
be
to
license
the
macintosh
operating
system
to
tandy
because
tandy
s
radio
shack
store
go
after
a
different
type
of
customer
murray
argue
it
would
not
severely
cannibalize
apple
sale
but
job
be
congenitally
averse
to
such
a
plan
his
approach
meant
that
the
macintosh
remain
a
control
environment
that
met
his
standard
but
it
also
meant
that
as
murray
fear
it
would
have
trouble
secure
its
place
as
an
industry
standard
in
a
world
of
ibm

of
the

more
than
anyone
who
kick
open

and
let
the
personal
computer
move
in
the
story
proclaim
it
be
a
richly
report
piece
but
also
harsh
at
time
so
harsh
that
moritz
after
he
write
a
book
about
apple
and
go
on
to
be
a
partner
in

with

repudiate
it
by
complain
that
his
reporting
have
be
siphon
filter
and
poison
with
gossipy
benzene
by
an

in

task
be
to

of

and

music
the
article
quote
bud
tribble
on
job
s
reality
distortion
field
and
note
that
he
would
occasionally
burst
into
tear
at
meeting
perhaps
the
best
quote
come
from
jef
raskin
job
he
declare
would
have
make
an
excellent
king
of
france
to
job
s
dismay
the
magazine
make
public
the
existence
of
the
daughter
he
have
forsaken
lisa
brennan
he
knew
that
kottke
have
be
the
one
to
tell
the
magazine
about
lisa
and
he
berate
him
in
the
mac
group
work
space
in
front
of
a
half
dozen
people
when
the
time
reporter
ask
me
if
steve
have
a
daughter
name
lisa
i
say
of
course
kottke
recall
friend
don
t
let
friend
deny
that
they
re
the
father
of
a
child
i
m
not
go
to
let
my
friend
be
a
jerk
and
deny
paternity
he
be
really
angry
and
felt
violate
and
told
me
in
front
of
everyone
that
i
have
betrayed
him
but
what
truly
devastate
job
be
that
he
be
not
after
all
chosen
as
the
man
of
the
year
as
he
later
told
me
time
decide
they
be
go
to
make
me
man
of
the
year
and
i
be
twenty
seven
so
i
actually
care
about
stuff
like
that
i
thought
it
be
pretty
cool
they
sent
out
mike
moritz
to
write
a
story
we
re
the
same
age
and
i
have
be
very
successful
and
i
could
tell
he
be
jealous
and
there
be
an
edge
to
him
he
write
this
terrible
hatchet
job
so
the
editor
in
new
york
get
this
story
and
say
we
can
t
make
this
guy
man
of
the
year
that
really
hurt
but
it
be
a
good
lesson
it
taught
me
to
never
get
too
excite
about
thing
like
that
since
the
medium
be
a
circus
anyway
they
fedexed
me
the
magazine
and
i
remember
opening
the
package
thoroughly
expect
to
see
my
mug
on
the
cover
and
it
be
this
computer
sculpture
thing
i
thought
huh
and
then
i
read
the
article
and
it
be
so
awful
that
i
actually
cry
in
fact
there
s
no
reason
to
believe
that
moritz
be
jealous
or
that
he
intend
his
reporting
to
be
unfair
nor
be
job
ever
slat
to
be
man
of
the
year
despite
what
he
thought
that
year
the
top
editor
i
be
then
a
junior
editor
there
decide
early
on
to
go
with
the
computer
rather
than
a
person
and
they
commission
month
in
advance
a
piece
of
art
from
the
famous
sculptor
george
segal
to
be
a
gatefold
cover
image
ray
cave
be
then
the
magazine
s
editor
we
never
consider
job
he
say
you
couldn
t
personify
the
computer
so
that
be
the
first
time
we
decide
to
go
with
an
inanimate
object
we
never
search
around
for
a
face
to
be
put
on
the
cover
apple
launch
the
lisa
in
january
a
full
year
before
the
mac
be
ready
and
job
paid
his
wager
to
couch
even
though
he
be
not
part
of
the
lisa
team
job
go
to
new
york
to
do
publicity
for
it
in
his
role
as
apple

chairman
and
poster
boy
he
have
learn
from
his
public
relation
consultant
regis
mckenna
how
to
dole
out
exclusive
interview
in
a
dramatic
manner
reporter
from
anoint
publication
be
ushered
in
sequentially
for
their
hour
with
him
in
his
carlyle
hotel
suite
where
a
lisa
computer
be
set
on
a
table
and
surround
by
cut
flower
the
publicity
plan
call
for
job
to
focus
on
the
lisa
and
not
mention
the
macintosh
because
speculation
about
it
could
undermine
the
lisa
but
job
couldn
t
help
himself
in
most
of
the
story
base
on
his
interview
that

would
ask
his

offbeat
question

one
day
he

be
too
uptight
and
conventional
to
manage
the
wizard
in

job
begin
to
toy
with
him
mercilessly
how

take
lsd
hertzfeld
recall
the
poor

shade
of
red
so
i
try
to
change
the

and
ask
a
straightforward
technical
question
but
when
the
candidate
drone
on
in
his
response
job
broke
in
gobble
gobble

crack
up
smith
and
hertzfeld
i
guess
i
m
not
the
right
guy
the
poor
man
say
as
he
get
up
to
leave
for
all
of
his
obnoxious
behavior
job
also
have
the
ability
to
instill
in
his
team
an
esprit
de
corp
after
tear
people
down
he
would
find
way
to
lift
them
up
and
make
them
feel
that
be
part
of
the
macintosh
project
be
an
amaze
mission
every
six
month
he
would
take
most
of
his
team
on
a
two
day
retreat
at
a
nearby
resort
the
retreat
in
september

or
so
member
of
the

in
the
lodge
face
a
fireplace
job
sat
on
top
of
a
table
in
front
of
them
he
spoke
quietly
for
a
while
then
walk
to
an
easel
and
begin
post
his
thought
the
first
be
don
t
compromise
it
be
an
injunction
that
would
over
time
be
both
helpful
and
harmful
most
technology
team
make
trade
offs
the
mac
on
the
other
hand
would
end
up
be
as
insanely
great
as
job
and
his
acolyte
could
possibly
make
it
but
it
would
not
ship
for
another
sixteen
month
way
behind
schedule
after
mention
a
schedule
completion
date
he
told
them
it
would
be
well
to
miss
than
to
turn
out
the
wrong
thing
a
different
type
of
project
manager
willing
to
make
some
trade
offs
might
try
to
lock
in
date
after
which
no
change
could
be
make
not
job
he
displayed
another
maxim
it
s
not
do
until
it
ship
another
chart
contain
a
ko
an
like
phrase
that
he
later
told
me
be
his
favorite
maxim
the
journey
be
the
reward
the
mac
team
he
like
to
emphasize
be
a
special
corp
with
an
exalt
mission
someday
they
would
all
look
back
on
their
journey
together
and
forget
or
laugh
off
the
painful
moment
would
regard
it
as
a
magical
high
point
in
their
life
at
the
end
of
the
presentation
someone
ask
whether
he
thought
they
should
do
some
market
research
to
see
what
customer
want
no
he
reply
because
customer
don
t
know
what
they
want
until
we
ve
show
them
then
he
pull
out
a
device
that
be
about
the
size
of
a
desk
diary
do
you
want
to
see
something
neat
when
he
flip
it
open
it
turn
out
to
be
a
mock
up
of
a
computer
that
could
fit
on
your
lap
with
a
keyboard
and
screen
hinge
together
like
a
notebook
this
be
my

be
make
in
the
mid
to
late

most
fun
thing
i
ve
do
in
my
life
year
later
most
of
those
in
the
audience
would
be
able
to
laugh
about
the
little
hard
to

proudly
all
the
way
through
to
the
completion
of
the
mac
project
we
be
the
renegade
and
we
want
people
to
know
it
he
recall
veteran
of
the
mac
team
have
learn
that
they
could
stand
up
to
job
if
they
knew
what
they
be
talk
about
he
would
tolerate
the
pushback
even
admire
it
by
those
most
familiar
with
his
reality
distortion
field
have
discover
something
far
they
could
if
necessary
just
quietly
disregard
what
he
decreed
if
they
turn
out
to
be
right
he
would
appreciate
their
renegade
attitude
and
willingness
to
ignore
authority
after
all
that
s
what
he
do
by
far
the
most
important
example
of
this
involve
the
choice
of
a
disk
drive
for
the
macintosh
apple
have
a
corporate
division
that
built
mass
storage
device
and
it
have
developed
a
disk
drive
system
code
name
twiggy
that
could
read
and
write
onto
those
thin
delicate
inch
floppy
disk
that
old
reader
who
also
remember
twiggy
the
model
will
recall
but
by
the
time
the
lisa
be
ready
to
ship
in
the
spring
of
it
be
clear
that
the
twiggy
be
buggy
because
the
lisa
also
come
with
a
hard
disk
drive
this
be
not
a
complete
disaster
but
the
mac
have
no
hard
disk
so
it
face
a
crisis
the
mac
team
be
begin
to
panic
say
hertzfeld
we
be
use
a
single
twiggy
drive
and
we
didn
t
have
a
hard
disk
to
fall
back
on
the
team
discuss
the
problem
at
the
january
retreat
and
debi
coleman
give
job
data
about
the
twiggy
failure
rate
a
few
day
later
he
drove
to
apple
s
factory
in
san
jose
to
see
the
twiggy
be
make
more
than
half
be
reject
job
erupt
with
his
face
flush
he
begin
shout
and
sputter
about
fire
everyone
who
work
there
bob
belleville
the
head
of
the
mac
engineering
team
gently
guide
him
to
the
parking
lot
where
they
could
take
a
walk
and
talk
about
alternative
one
possibility
that
belleville
have
be
explore
be
to
use
a
new
inch
disk
drive
that
sony
have
developed
the
disk
be
case
in
sturdier
plastic
and
could
fit
into
a
shirt
pocket
another
option
be
to
have
a
clone
of
sony
s
inch
disk
drive
manufacture
by
a
small
japanese
supplier
the
alp
electronics
co
which
have
be
supply
disk
drive
for
the
apple
ii
alp
have
already
license
the
technology
from
sony
and
if
they
could
build
their
own
version
in
time
it
would
be
much
cheaper
job
and
belleville
along
with
apple
veteran
rod
holt
the
guy
job
enlist
to
design
the
first
power

from
tokyo
to
visit
the
alp

the

it
be
great
but
belleville
be
appalled
there
be
no
way
he
thought
that
alp
could
have
it
ready
for
the
mac
within
a
year
as
they
proceed
to
visit
other
japanese
company
job
be
on
his
bad
behavior
he
wore
jean
and
sneaker
to
meeting
with
japanese
manager
in
dark
suit
when
they
formally
hand
him
little
gift
as
be
the
custom
he
often
left
them
behind
and
he
never
reciprocate
with
gift
of
his
own
he
would
sneer
when
row
of
engineer
line
up
to
greet
him
bow
and
politely
offer
their
product
for
inspection
job
hat
both
the
device
and
the
obsequiousness
what
be
you
show
me
this
for
he
snap
at
one
stop
this
be
a
piece
of
crap
anybody
could
build
a
well
drive
than
this
although
most
of
his
host
be
appalled
some
seem
amuse
they
have
heard
tale
of
his
obnoxious
style
and
brash
behavior
and
now
they
be
get
to
see
it
in
full
display
the
final
stop
be
the
sony
factory
locate
in
a
drab
suburb
of
tokyo
to
job
it
look
messy
and
inelegant
a
lot
of
the
work
be
do
by
hand
he
hat
it
back
at
the

belleville
argue
for
go
with
the
sony
disk
drive
it
be
ready
to
use
job
disagreed
he
decide
that
they
would
work
with
alp
to
produce
their
own
drive
and
he
order
belleville
to
cease
all
work
with
sony
belleville
decide
it
be
best
to
partially
ignore
job
and
he
ask
a
sony
executive
to
get
its
disk
drive
ready
for
use
in
the
macintosh
if
and
when
it
become
clear
that
alp
could
not
deliver
on
time
apple
would
switch
to

so
sony
sent
over
the

who
have
developed
the

hidetoshi
komoto
a
purdue
graduate
who
fortunately
possess
a
good
sense
of
humor
about
his
clandestine
task
whenever
job
would
come
from
his
corporate
office
to
visit
the
mac
team
s

one
point
job
ran
into
him
at
a
newsstand
in
cupertino
and
recognize
him
from
the
meeting
in
japan
but
he
didn
t
suspect
anything
the
closest
call
be
when
job
come
bustling
onto
the
mac
work
space
unexpectedly
one
day
while
komoto
be

of
the
cubicle
a

him
and

in
this
closet
please

but
he
jumped
up
and
do
as
told
he
have
to
stay
in
the
closet
for
five
minute
until

problem
he
reply
but
american

they
be
very
strange
very
strange
belleville
s
prediction
come
true
in
may
the
folk
at
alp
admit
it
would
take
them
at
least
eighteen
more
month
to
get
their
clone
of
the
sony

hertzfeld
steve

that
he

run
the

himself
even
though
there
be
a
part
of
him
that
want
to
try
despite
his
arrogance
he
could
be
self
aware
markkula
agree
he
told
job
that
he
be
still
a
bit
too
rough
edge
and
immature
to
be
apple
s
president
so
they
launch
a
search
for
someone
from
the
outside
the
person
they
most
want
be
don

he
be
driven
and
inspire
but
unlike

to
allow
others
to
think
that
his
brilliant
idea
be

flew
to
boca

with
the
offer
of

but
estridge
turn
him
down
he
be
not
the
type
who
would
jump

to
join
the
enemy
he
also
enjoy
be
part
of
the
establishment
a
member

so
much
from
you

cultivate
father
figure
in
the
past
knew
just
how
to
play
to
sculley
s
ego
and
insecurity
it
work
i
be
smitten
by
him
sculley
later

steve
be
one
of
the
brightest
people
i
d
ever
met

share
with
him
a
passion
for
idea

who
be
interested
in
art
history
steer
them
toward
the
metropolitan
museum
for
a
little
test
of
whether
job
be
really
willing
to
learn
from
others
i
want
to
see
how
well
he
could
take
coach
in
a
subject
where
he
have
no
background
he
recall
as
they
stroll
through
the
greek
and
roman
antiquity
sculley
expound
on
the
difference
between
the
archaic
sculpture
of
the
sixth
century
b
c
and
the
periclean
sculpture
a
century
later
job
who
love
to
pick
up
historical
nugget
he
never
learn
in
college
seem
to
soak
it
in
i
gain
a
sense
that
i
could
be
a
teacher
to
a
brilliant
student
sculley
recall
once
again
he
indulge
the
conceit
that
they
be
alike
i
saw
in
him
a
mirror
image
of
my
young
self
i
too
be
impatient
stubborn
arrogant
impetuous
my
mind
explode
with
idea
often
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
i
too
be
intolerant
of
those
who
couldn
t
live
up
to
my
demand
as
they
continued
their
long
walk
sculley
confide
that
on

go
to
the
left
bank
in

in
his
sketchbook
if
he
hadn
t
become
a
businessman
he
would
be
an
artist
job
reply
that
if
he
weren
t
work
with
computer
he
could
see
himself
as
a
poet
in

on
one
of
the

up
bonus
say
sculley
job

would
be
doable
even
if
i
have
to
pay
for
it
out
of
my
own
pocket
he
say
we

person
who
could
teach
him
the
most
job
give
him
his
unblinking
stare
sculley
uttered
one
last
demurral
a
token
suggestion
that
maybe
they
should
just

sideline
any
time

climactic
moment

star
at
his
foot
after
a
weighty
uncomfortable
pause

haunt
me
for
day
do
you
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life

in
the
stomach
there
be
no
response
possible
other
than
to
acquiesce

have
an
uncanny
ability
to
always
get
what
he
want
to
size
up
a
person
and
know
exactly
what
to
say
to

the
contradictory
advice
the
specter

of
his

quirk
his
exact
standard
of
craftsmanship
combine
with
a
spartan
streak
make
him
reluctant
to
buy
any
furnishing
that
he
wasn

passionate
about
he

rather
than

sculley
smile
and
mistakenly
thought
that
it
be
similar
to
his
own
frantic
and
spartan
life
in
a
clutter
new
york
city
apartment
early
in
his
own
career
job
confide
in
sculley
that
he
believe
he
would
die
young
and
therefore
he
need
to
accomplish
thing
quickly
so
that
he
would
make
his
mark
on
silicon
valley
history
we
all
have
a
short
period
of
time
on
this
earth
he
told
the
sculleys
as
they
sat
around
the
table
that
morning
we
probably
only
have
the
opportunity
to
do
a
few
thing
really
great
and
do
them
well
none
of
us
have
any
idea
how
long
we
re
go
to
be
here
nor
do
i
but
my
feel
be
i
ve
get
to
accomplish
a
lot
of
these
thing
while
i
m
young
job
and
sculley
would
talk
dozen
of
time
a
day
in
the
early
month
of
their
relationship
steve
and
i
become
soul
mate
near
constant
companion
sculley
say
we
tend
to
speak
in
half
sentence
and
phrase
job
flatter
sculley
when
he
drop
by
to
hash
something
out
he
would
say
something
like
you
re
the
only
one
who
will
understand
they
would
tell
each
other
repeatedly
indeed
so
often
that
it
should
have
be
worry
how
happy
they
be
to
be
with
each
other
and
work
in
tandem
and
at
every
opportunity
sculley
would
find
similarity
with
job
and
point
them
out
we
could
complete
each
other
s
sentence
because
we
be
on
the
same
wavelength
steve
would
rouse
me
from
sleep
at
a
m
with
a
phone
call
to
chat
about
an
idea
that
suddenly
cross
his
mind
hi
it
s
me
he
d
harmlessly
say
to
the
daze
listener
totally
unaware
of
the
time
i
curiously
have
do
the
same
in
my
pepsi
day
steve
would
rip
apart
a
presentation
he
have
to
give
the
next
morning
throw
out
slide
and
text
so
have
i
as
i
struggle
to
turn
public
speak
into
an
important
management
tool
during
my
early
day
at
pepsi
as
a
young
executive
i
be
always
impatient
to
get
thing
do
and
often
felt
i
could
do
them
well
myself
so
do
steve
sometimes
i
felt
as
if
i
be
watch
steve
play
me
in
a
movie
the
similarity
be
uncanny
and
they
be
behind
the
amaze
symbiosis
we
developed
this
be
self
delusion
and
it
be
a
recipe
for
disaster
job
begin
to
sense
it
early
on
we
have
different
way
of
look
at
the
world
different
view
on
people
different
value
job
recall
i
begin
to
realize
this
a
few
month
after
he
arrive
he
didn
t
learn
thing
very
quickly
and
the
people
he
want
to
promote
be
usually
bozo
yet
job
knew
that
he
could
manipulate
sculley
by
encourage
his
belief
that
they
be
so
alike
and
the
more
he
manipulate
sculley
the
more
contemptuous
of
him
he
become
canny
observer
in
the
mac
group
such
as
joanna
hoffman
soon
realize
what
be
happen
and
knew
that
it
would
make
the
inevitable
breakup
more
explosive
steve
make
sculley
feel
like
he
be
exceptional
she
say
sculley
have
never
felt
that
sculley
become
infatuate
because
steve
project
on
him
a
whole
bunch
of
attribute
that
he
didn
t
really
have
when
it
become
clear
that
sculley
didn
t
match
all
of
these
projection
steve
s
distortion
of
reality
have
create
an
explosive
situation
the
ardor
eventually
begin
to
cool
on
sculley
s
side
as
well
part
of
his
weakness
in
try
to
manage
a
dysfunctional
company
be
his
desire
to
please
other
people
one
of
many
trait
that
he
do
not
share
with
job
he
be
a
polite
person
this
cause
him
to
recoil
at
job
s
rudeness
to
their
fellow
worker
we
would
go
to
the
mac
building
at
eleven
at
night
he
recall
and
they
would
bring
him
code
to
show
in
some
case
he
wouldn
t
even
look
at
it
he
would
just
take
it
and
throw
it
back
at
them
i
d
say
how
can
you
turn
it
down
and
he
would
say
i
know
they
can
do
well
sculley
try
to
coach
him
you
ve
get
to
learn
to
hold
thing
back
he
told
him
at
one
point
job
would
agree
but
it
be
not
in
his
nature
to
filter
his
feeling
through
a
gauze
sculley
begin
to
believe
that
job
s
mercurial
personality
and
erratic
treatment
of
people
be
root
deep
in
his
psychological
makeup
perhaps
the
reflection
of
a
mild
bipolarity
there
be
big
mood
swing
sometimes
he
would
be
ecstatic
at
other
time
he
be
depressed
at
time
he
would
launch
into
brutal
tirade
without
warn
and
sculley
would
have
to
calm
him
down
twenty
minute
later
i
would
get
another
call
and
be
told
to
come
over
because
steve
be
lose
it
again
he
say
their
first
substantive
disagreement
be
over
how
to
price
the
macintosh
it
have
be
conceive
as
a
machine
but
job
s
design
change
have
push
up
the
cost
so
that
the
plan
be
to
sell
it
at
however
when
job
and
sculley
begin
make
plan
for
a
huge
launch
and
marketing
push
sculley
decide
that
they
need
to
charge
more
to
him
the
marketing
cost
be
like
any
other
production
cost
and
need
to
be
factor
into
the
price
job
resist
furiously
it
will
destroy
everything
we
stand
for
he
say
i
want
to
make
this
a
revolution
not
an
effort
to
squeeze
out
profit
sculley
say
it
be
a
simple
choice
he
could
have
the
price
or
he
could
have
the
marketing
budget
for
a
big
launch
but
not
both
you
re
not
go
to
like
this
job
told
hertzfeld
and
the
other
engineer
but
sculley
be
insist
that
we
charge
for
the
mac
instead
of
indeed
the
engineer
be
horrify
hertzfeld
point
out
that
they
be
design
the
mac
for
people
like
themselves
and
overprice
it
would
be
a
betrayal
of
what
they
stood
for
so
job
promise
them
don
t
worry
i
m
not
go
to
let
him
get
away
with
it
but
in
the
end
sculley
prevail
even
twenty
five

later

when
recall
the

it

the
main
reason

the

job

and
now
the

have
the
ad
in
the
spring
of
when
job
have
begin
to
plan
for
the

he
ask
for
a
commercial
that
be
as
revolutionary
and
astonish
as
the
product
they
have
create
i
want
something
that
will
stop
people
in

he
say
i

the

when
it
bought
the

side
of
regis
mckenna
s
business
the
person
put
in
charge
be
a

beach
bum
with
a
bushy
beard
wild
hair
goofy
grin
and
twinkle
eye
name
lee

who
be
the

director
of
the

section
of
los

clow
be
savvy
and
fun
in
a
laid
back
yet
focus
way
and
he
forge
a
bond
with
job
that
would
last
three
decade
clow
and
two
of
his
team
the
copywriter
steve
hayden
and
the
art
director
brent
thomas
have
be
toy
with
a
tagline
that
played
off
the
george
orwell
novel
why
won
t
be
like
job
love
it
and
ask
them
to
develop
it
for
the
macintosh
launch
so
they
put
together
a
storyboard
for
a
sixty
second
ad
that
would
look
like
a
scene
from
a
sci
fi
movie
it
feature
a
rebellious
young
woman
outrun
the
orwellian
thought
police
and
throw
a
sledgehammer
into
a
screen
show
a
mind
control
speech
by
big
brother
the
concept
capture
the
zeitgeist
of
the
personal
computer
revolution
many
young
people
especially
those
in
the
counterculture
have
view
computer
as
instrument
that
could
be
use
by
orwellian
government
and
giant
corporation
to
sap
individuality
but
by
the
end
of
the
s
they
be
also
be
see
as
potential
tool
for
personal
empowerment
the
ad
cast
macintosh
as
a
warrior
for
the
latter
cause
a
cool
rebellious
and
heroic
company
that
be
the
only
thing
stand
in
the
way
of
the
big
evil
corporation
s
plan
for
world
domination
and
total
mind
control
job
like
that
indeed
the
concept
for
the
ad
have
a
special
resonance
for
him
he
fancy
himself
a
rebel
and
he
like
to
associate
himself
with
the
value
of
the
ragtag
band
of
hacker
and
pirate
he
recruit
to
the
macintosh
group
even
though
he
have
left
the
apple
commune
in
oregon
to
start
the
apple
corporation
he
still
want
to
be
view
as
a
denizen
of
the
counterculture
rather
than
the
corporate
culture
but
he
also
realize
deep
inside
that
he
have
increasingly
abandon
the
hacker
spirit
some
might
even
accuse
him
of
sell
out
when
wozniak
held
true
to
the
homebrew
ethic
by
share
his
design
for
the
apple
i
for
free
it
be
job
who
insist
that
they
sell
the
board
instead
he
be
also
the
one
who
despite
wozniak
s
reluctance
want
to
turn
apple
into
a
corporation
and
not
freely
distribute
stock
option
to
the
friend
who
have
be
in
the
garage
with
them
now
he
be
about
to
launch
the
macintosh
a
machine
that
violate
many
of
the
principle
of
the
hacker
s
code
it
be
overprice
it
would
have
no
slot
which
meant
that
hobbyist
could
not
plug
in
their
own
expansion
card
or
jack
into
the
motherboard
to
add
their
own
new
function
and
it
take
special
tool
just
to
open
the
plastic
case
it
be
a
close
and
control
system
like
something
design
by
big
brother
rather
than
by
a
hacker
so
the
ad
be
a
way
of
reaffirm
to
himself
and
to
the
world
his
desire
self
image
the
heroine
with
a
draw
of
a
macintosh
emblazon
on
her
pure
white
tank
top
be
a
renegade
out
to
foil
the

today
for

i
d

hello
i
m

it

great
to

the
only
thing
it
didn

how
to
do
be
to

i
d

obviously
i
can
talk
but
right
now
i
d
like
to
sit
back

with
considerable
pride
that
i
introduce
a

tell
that
bill
gate
be
not
a
very
good
listener
he
couldn
t
bear
to
have
anyone
explain
how
something
work
to
him
he
have
to
leap
ahead
instead
and
guess
about
how
he
thought
it
would
work
hertzfeld
recall
they
show
him
how
the
macintosh
s
cursor
move
smoothly
across
the
screen
without
flicker
what
kind
of
hardware
do
you
use
to
draw
the
cursor
gate
ask
hertzfeld
who
take
great
pride
that
they
could
achieve
their
functionality
solely
use
software
reply
we
don
t
have
any
special
hardware
for
it
gate
insist
that
it
be
necessary
to
have
special
hardware
to
move
the
cursor
that
way
so
what
do
you
say
to
somebody
like
that
bruce
horn
one
of
the
macintosh
engineer
later
say
it
make
it
clear
to
me
that
gate
be
not
the
kind
of
person
that
would
understand
or
appreciate
the
elegance
of
a
macintosh
despite
their
mutual
wariness
both
team
be
excite
by
the
prospect
that
microsoft
would
create
graphical
software
for
the
macintosh
that
would
take
personal
compute
into
a
new
realm
and
they
go
to
dinner
at
a
fancy
restaurant
to
celebrate
microsoft
soon
dedicate
a
large
team
to
the
task
we
have
more
people
work
on
the
mac
than
he
do
gate
say
he
have
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
people
we
have
like
twenty
people
we
really
bet
our
life
on
it
and
even
though
job
thought
that
they
didn
t
exhibit
much
taste
the
microsoft
programmer
be
persistent
they
come
out
with
application
that
be
terrible
job
recall
but
they
kept
at
it
and
they
make
them
well
eventually
job
become
so
enamor
of
excel
that
he
make
a
secret
bargain
with
gate
if
microsoft
would
make
excel
exclusively
for
the
macintosh
for
two
year
and
not
make
a
version
for
ibm
pc
then
job
would
shut
down
his
team
work
on
a
version
of
basic
for
the
macintosh
and
instead
indefinitely
license
microsoft
s
basic
gate
smartly
take
the
deal
which
infuriate
the
apple
team
whose
project
get
cancel
and
give
microsoft
a
lever
in
future
negotiation
for
the
time
be
gate
and
job
forge
a
bond
that
summer
they
go
to
a
conference
host
by
the
industry
analyst
ben
rosen
at
a
playboy
club
retreat
in
lake
geneva
wisconsin
where
nobody
knew
about
the
graphical
interface
that
apple
be
develop
everybody
be
act
like
the
ibm
pc
be
everything
which

nice
but
steve
and
i
be
kind
of
smile
that
hey
we
ve
get
something
gate
recall
and
he
s
kind
of
leak
but
nobody
actually
caught
on
gate
become
a
regular
at
apple
retreat
i
go
to
every
luau
say

i
be
part
of
the
crew
gate
enjoy
his
frequent
visit
to
cupertino
where
he
get
to
watch
job
interact
erratically
with
his
employee
and
display
his
obsession
steve
be
in
his
ultimate
pied
piper
mode
proclaim
how
the
mac
will
change
the
world
and
overwork
people
like
mad
with
incredible
tension
and
complex
personal
relationship
sometimes
job
would
begin
on
a
high
then
lapse
into
share
his
fear
with
gate
we
d
go
down
friday
night
have
dinner
and
steve
would
just
be
promote
that
everything
be
great
then
the
second
day
without
fail
he
d
be
kind
of
oh
shit
be
this
thing
go
to
sell
oh
god
i
have
to
raise
the
price
i
m
sorry
i
do
that
to
you
and
my
team
be
a
bunch
of
idiot
gate
saw
job
s
reality
distortion
field
at
play
when
the
xerox
star
be
launch
at
a
joint
team
dinner
one
friday
night
job
ask
gate
how
many
star
have
be
sell
thus
far
gate
say
six
hundred
the
next
day
in
front
of
gate
and
the
whole
team
job
say
that
three
hundred
star
have
be
sell
forget
that
gate
have
just
told
everyone
it
be
actually
six
hundred
so
his
whole
team
start
look
at
me
like
be
you
go
to
tell
him
that
he
s
full
of
shit
gate
recall
and
in
that
case
i
didn
t
take
the
bait
on
another
occasion
job
and
his
team
be
visit
microsoft
and
have
dinner
at
the
seattle
tennis
club
job
launch
into
a
sermon
about
how
the
macintosh
and
its
software
would
be
so
easy
to
use
that
there
would
be
no
manual
it
be
like
anybody
who
ever
thought
that
there
would
be
a
manual
for
any
mac
application
be
the
great
idiot
say
gate
and
we
be
like
do
he
really
mean
it
should
we
not
tell
him
that
we
have
people
who
be
actually
work
on
manual
after
a
while
the
relationship
become
bumpier
the
original
plan
be
to
have
some
of
the
microsoft
application
such
as
excel
chart
and
file
carry
the
apple
logo
and
come
bundle
with
the
purchase
of
a
macintosh
we
be
go
to
get
per
app
per
machine
say
gate
but
this
arrangement
upset
compete
software
maker
in
addition
it
seem
that
some
of
microsoft
s
program
might
be
late
so
job
invoked
a
provision
in
his
deal
with
microsoft
and
decide
not
to
bundle
its
software
microsoft
would
have
to
scramble
to
distribute
its
software
as
product
sell
directly
to
consumer
gate
go
along
without
much
complaint
he
be
already
get
use
to
the
fact
that
as
he
put
it
job
could
play
fast
and
loose
and
he
suspect
that
the
unbundling
would
actually
help
microsoft
we
could
make
more
money
sell
our
software
separately
gate
say
it
work
well
that
way
if
you
re
willing
to
think
you
re
go
to
have
reasonable
market
share
microsoft
end
up
make
its
software
for
various
other
platform
and
it
begin
to
give
priority
to
the
ibm
pc
version
of
microsoft
word
rather
than
the
macintosh
version
in
the
end
job
s
decision
to
back
out
of
the
bundling
deal
hurt
apple
more
than
it
do
microsoft
when
excel
for
the
macintosh
be
release
job
and
gate
unveiled
it
together
at
a
press
dinner
at
new
york
s
tavern
on
the
green
ask
if
microsoft
would
make
a
version
of
it
for
ibm
pc
gate
do
not
reveal
the
bargain
he
have
make
with
job
but
merely
answer
that
in
time
that
might
happen
job
take
the
microphone
i
m
sure
in
time
we
ll
all
be
dead
he
joked
the
battle
of
the
gui
at
that
time
microsoft
be
produce
an
operating
system
know
as
do
which
it
license
to
ibm
and
compatible
computer
it
be
base
on
an
old
fashion
command
line
interface
that
confront
user
with
surly
little
prompt
such
as
c
as
job
and
his
team
begin
to
work
closely
with
microsoft
they
grow
worried
that
it
would
copy
macintosh
s
graphical
user
interface
andy
hertzfeld
notice
that
his
contact
at
microsoft
be
ask
detailed
question
about
how
the
macintosh
operating
system
work
i
told
steve
that
i
suspect
that
microsoft
be
go
to
clone
the
mac
he
recall
they
be
right
to
worry
gate
believe
that
graphical
interface
be
the
future
and
that
microsoft
have
just
as
much
right
as
apple
do
to
copy
what
have
be
developed
at
xerox
parc
as
he
freely
admit
later
we
sort
of
say
hey
we
believe
in
graphic
interface
we
saw
the
xerox
alto
too
in
their
original
deal
job
have
convince
gate
to
agree
that
microsoft
would
not
create
graphical
software
for
anyone
other
than
apple
until
a
year
after
the
macintosh
ship
in
january
unfortunately
for
apple
it
do
not
provide
for
the
possibility
that
the
macintosh
launch
would
be
delayed
for
a
year
so
gate
be
within
his
right
when
in
november
he
reveal
that
microsoft
plan
to
develop
a
new
operating
system
for
ibm
pc
feature
a
graphical
interface
with
window
icon
and
a
mouse
for
point
and
click
navigation
it
would
be
call
window
gate
host
a
job
like
product
announcement
the
most
lavish
thus
far
in
microsoft
s
history
at
the
helmsley
palace
hotel
in
new
york
job
be
furious
he
knew
there
be
little
he
could
do
about
it
microsoft
s
deal
with
apple
not
to
do
compete
graphical
software
be
run
out
but
he
lash
out
nonetheless
get
gate
down
here
immediately
he
order
mike
boich
who
be
apple
s
evangelist
to
other
software
company
gate
arrive
alone
and
willing
to
discus
thing
with
job
he
call
me
down
to
get
piss
off
at
me
gate
recall
i
go
down
to
cupertino
like
a
command
performance
i
told
him
we
re
do
window
i
say
to
him
we
re
bet
our
company
on
graphical
interface
they
met
in
job
s
conference
room
where
gate
found
himself
surround
by
ten
apple
employee
who
be
eager
to
watch
their
bos
assail
him
job
didn
t
disappoint
his
troop
you
re
rip
us
off
he
shout
i
trust
you
and
now
you
re
steal
from
us
hertzfeld
recall
that
gate
just
sat
there
coolly
look
steve
in
the
eye
before
hurl
back
in
his
squeaky
voice
what
become
a
classic
zinger
well
steve
i
think
there
s
more
than
one
way
of
look
at
it
i
think
it
s
more
like
we
both
have
this
rich
neighbor
name
xerox
and
i
broke
into
his
house
to
steal
the
tv
set
and
found
out
that
you
have
already
steal
it
gate
s
two
day
visit
provoke
the
full
range
of
job
s
emotional
response
and
manipulation
technique
it
also
make
clear
that
the
apple
microsoft
symbiosis
have
become
a
scorpion
dance
with
both
side
circle
warily
know
that
a
sting
by
either
could
cause
problem
for
both
after
the
confrontation
in
the
conference
room
gate
quietly
give
job
a
private
demo
of
what
be
be
plan
for
window
steve
didn
t
know
what
to
say
gate
recall
he
could
either
say
oh
this
be
a
violation
of
something
but
he
didn
t
he
chose
to
say
oh
it
s
actually
really
a
piece
of
shit
gate
be
thrill
because
it
give
him
a
chance
to
calm
job
down
for
a
moment
i
say
yes
it
s
a
nice
little
piece
of
shit
so
job
go
through
a
gamut
of
other
emotion
during
the
course
of
this
meeting
he
s
just
ruder
than
shit
gate
say
and
then
there
s
a
part
where
he
s
almost
cry
like
oh
just
give
me
a
chance
to
get
this
thing
off
gate
respond
by
become
very
calm
i
m
good
at
when
people
be
emotional
i
m
kind
of
less
emotional
as
he
often
do
when
he
want
to
have
a
serious
conversation
job
suggest
they
go
on
a
long
walk
they
trekked
the
street
of
cupertino
back
and
forth
to
de
anza
college
stop
at
a
diner
and
then
walk
some
more
we
have
to
take
a
walk
which
be
not
one
of
my
management
technique
gate
say
that
be
when
he
begin
say
thing
like
okay
okay
but
don
t
make
it
too
much
like
what
we
re
do
as
it
turn
out
microsoft
wasn
t
able
to
get
window
ready
for
shipping
until
the
fall
of
even
then
it
be
a
shoddy
product
it
lack
the
elegance
of
the
macintosh
interface
and
it
have
tile
window
rather
than
the
magical
clip
of
overlap
window
that
bill
atkinson
have
devise
reviewer
ridicule
it
and
consumer
spurn
it
nevertheless
as
be
often
the
case
with
microsoft
product
persistence
eventually
make
window
well
and
then
dominant
job
never
get
over
his
anger
they
just
ripped
us
off
completely
because
gate
have
no
shame
job
told
me
almost
thirty
year
later
upon
hearing
this
gate
respond
if
he
believe
that
he
really
have
enter
into
one
of
his
own
reality
distortion
field
in
a
legal
sense
gate
be
right
as
court
over
the
year
have
subsequently
rule
and
on
a
practical
level
he
have
a
strong
case
as
well
even
though
apple
make
a
deal
for
the
right
to
use
what
it
saw
at
xerox
parc
it
be
inevitable
that
other
company
would
develop
similar
graphical
interface
as
apple
found
out
the
look
and
feel
of
a
computer
interface
design
be
a
hard
thing
to
protect
and
yet
job

be
fold
together
with
job
in
charge
he
be
fly
high
but
this
do
not
serve
to
make
him
more
mellow
indeed
there
be
a
memorable
display
of
his
brutal
honesty
when
he
stood
in
front
of
the
combine
lisa
and
macintosh
team
to
describe
how
they
would
be
merge
his
macintosh
group
leader
would
get
all
of
the
top
position
he
say
and
a
quarter
of
the
lisa
staff
would
be
laid
off
you
guy
fail
he
say
look
directly
at
those
who
have
work
on
the
lisa
you
re
a
b
team
b
player
too
many
people
here
be
b
or
c
player
so
today
we
be
release
some
of
you
to
have
the
opportunity
to
work
at
our
sister
company
here
in
the
valley
bill
atkinson
who
have
work
on
both
team
thought
it
be
not
only
callous
but
unfair
these
people
have
work
really
hard
and
be
brilliant
engineer
he
say
but
job
have
latch
onto
what
he
believe
be
a
key
management
lesson
from
his
macintosh
experience
you
have
to
be
ruthless
if
you
want
to
build
a
team
of
a
player
it
s
too
easy
as
a
team
grows
to
put
up
with
a
few
b
player
and
they
then
attract
a
few
more
b
player
and
soon
you
will
even
have
some
c
player
he
recall
the
macintosh
experience
taught
me
that
a
player
like
to
work
only
with
other
a
player
which
mean
you
can
t
indulge
b
player
for
the
time
be
job
and
sculley
be
able
to
convince
themselves
that
their
friendship
be
still
strong
they
profess
their
fondness
so
effusively
and
often
that
they
sound
like
high
school
sweetheart
at
a
hallmark
card
display
the
first
anniversary
of
sculley
s
arrival
come
in
may
and
to
celebrate
job
lure
him
to
a
dinner
party
at
le
mouton
noir
an
elegant
restaurant
in
the
hill
southwest
of
cupertino
to
sculley
s
surprise
job
have
gather
the
apple
board
its
top
manager
and
even
some
east
coast
investor
as
they
all
congratulate
him
during
cocktail
sculley
recall
a
beam
steve
stood
in
the
background
nod
his
head
up
and
down
and
wear
a
cheshire
cat
smile
on
his
face
job
begin
the
dinner
with
a
fulsome
toast
the
happiest
two
day
for
me
be
when
macintosh
ship
and
when
john
sculley
agree
to
join
apple
he
say
this
have
be
the
great
year
i
ve
ever
have
in
my
whole
life
because
i
ve
learn
so
much
from
john
he
then
present
sculley
with
a
montage
of
memorabilia
from
the
year
in
response
sculley
effuse
about
the
joy
of
be
job
s
partner
for
the
past
year
and
he
conclude
with
a
line
that
for
different
reason
everyone
at
the
table
found
memorable
apple
have
one
leader
he
say
steve
and
me
he
look
across
the
room
caught
job
s
eye
and
watch
him
smile
it
be
as
if
we
be
communicate
with
each
other
sculley
recall
but
he
also
notice
that
arthur
rock
and
some
of
the
others
be
look
quizzical
perhaps
even
skeptical
they
be
worried
that
job
be
completely
roll
him
they
have
hire
sculley
to
control
job
and
now
it
be
clear
that
job
be
the
one
in
control
sculley
be
so
eager
for
steve
s
approval
that
he
be
unable
to
stand
up
to
him
rock
recall
keep
job
happy
and
defer
to
his
expertise
may
have
seem
like
a
smart
strategy
to
sculley
but
he
fail
to
realize
that
it
be
not
in
job
s
nature
to
share
control
deference
do
not
come
naturally
to
him
he
begin
to
become
more
vocal
about
how
he
thought
the
company
should
be
run
at
the
business
strategy
meeting
for
example
he
push
to
make
the
company
s
centralize
sale
and
marketing
staff
bid
on
the
right
to
provide
their
service
to
the
various
product
division
this
would
have
meant
for
example
that
the
macintosh
group
could
decide
not
to
use
apple
s
marketing
team
and
instead
create
one
of
its
own
no
one
else
be
in
favor
but
job
kept
try
to
ram
it
through
people
be
look
to
me
to
take
control
to
get
him
to
sit
down
and
shut
up
but
i
didn
t
sculley
recall
as
the
meeting
broke
up
he
heard
someone
whisper
why
doesn
t
sculley
shut
him
up
when
job
decide
to
build
a
state
of
the
art
factory
in
fremont
to
manufacture
the
macintosh
his
aesthetic
passion
and
control
nature
kick
into
high
gear
he
want
the
machinery
to
be
paint
in
bright
hue
like
the
apple
logo
but
he
spent
so
much
time
go
over
paint
chip
that
apple
s
manufacturing
director
matt
carter
finally
just
instal
them
in
their
usual
beige
and
gray
when
job
take
a
tour
he
order
that
the
machine
be
repaint
in
the
bright
color
he
want
carter
object
this
be
precision
equipment
and
repaint
the
machine
could
cause
problem
he
turn
out
to
be
right
one
of
the
most
expensive
machine
which
get
paint
bright
blue
end
up
not
work
properly
and
be
dubbed
steve
s
folly
finally
carter
quit
it
take
so
much
energy
to
fight
him
and
it
be
usually
over
something
so
pointless
that
finally
i
have
enough
he
recall
job
tapped
as
a
replacement
debi
coleman
the
spunky
but
good
natured
macintosh
financial
officer
who
have
once
won
the
team
s
annual
award
for
the
person
who
best
stood
up
to
job
but
she
knew
how
to
cater
to
his
whim
when
necessary
when
apple
s
art
director
clement
mok
inform
her
that
job
want
the
wall
to
be
pure
white
she
protest

t
paint
a
factory
pure
white
there
s
go
to
be
dust
and
stuff
all
over
mok
reply
there
s
no

that
s
too

for
steve
she
end
up
go
along
with
its
pure
white
wall
and
its
bright
blue
yellow
and
red
machine
the
factory
floor
look
like
an
alexander
calder
showcase
say
coleman
when
ask
about
his
obsessive
concern
over
the
look
of
the
factory
job
say
it
be
a
way
to
ensure
a
passion
for
perfection
i
d
go
out
to
the
factory
and
i
d
put
on
a
white
glove
to
check
for
dust
i
d
find
it
everywhere
on
machine
on
the
top
of
the
rack
on
the
floor
and
i
d
ask
debi

get
it
clean
i
told
her

thought
we
should
be

to
eat
off
the
floor
of
the
factory
well
this
drove
debi
up
the
wall
she
didn
t
understand
why
and
i
couldn
t
articulate
it
back
then
see
i
d
be
very
influence
by
what
i
d
see
in
japan
part
of
what
i
greatly
admire
there
and
part
of
what
we
be
lack
in
our
factory
be
a
sense
of
teamwork
and
discipline
if
we
didn
t
have
the
discipline
to
keep
that
place
spotless
then
we
weren

he
have
his

way
with
the
truth
gas
e
later

the
only
way
to

be
to
out
bully
him
when
job
make
his
usual
threat
about

then
he
back
down
i
use
to
be
an
angry
man
myself
i
be
a
recover
assaholic
so
i
could
recognize
that
in
steve
gas
e
be
impressed
however
at
how
job
could
turn
on
the
charm
when
he
want
to
fran
ois
mitterrand
have
be
preach
the
gospel
of
informatique
pour
tous
compute
for
all
and
various
academic
expert
in
technology
such
as
marvin
minsky
and
nicholas
negroponte
come
over
to
sing
in
the
choir
job
give
a
talk
to
the
group
at
the
hotel
bristol
and
paint
a
picture
of
how
france
could
move
ahead
if
it
put
computer
in
all
of
its
school
paris
also
brought
out
the
romantic
in
him
both
gas

and
negroponte
tell
tale
of
him
pin
over
woman
while
there
fall
after
the
burst
of
excitement
that
accompany
the
release
of
macintosh
its
sale
begin
to
taper
off
in
the
second
half
of
the
problem
be
a
fundamental
one
it
be
a
dazzle
but
woefully
slow
and
underpowered
computer
and
no
amount
of
hoopla
could
mask
that
its
beauty
be
that
its
user
interface
look
like
a
sunny
playroom
rather
than
a
somber
dark
screen
with
sickly
green
pulsate
letter
and
surly
command
line
but
that
lead
to
its
great
weakness
a
character
on
a
text
base
display
take
less
than
a
byte
of
code
whereas
when
the
mac
drew
a
letter
pixel
by
pixel
in
any
elegant
font
you
want
it
require
twenty
or
thirty
time
more
memory
the
lisa
handle
this
by
shipping
with
more
than
k
ram
whereas
the
macintosh
make
do
with
k
another
problem
be
the
lack
of
an
internal
hard
disk
drive
job
have
call
joanna
hoffman
a
xerox
bigot
when
she
fought
for
such
a
storage
device
he
insist
that
the
macintosh
have
just
one
floppy
disk
drive
if
you
want
to
copy
data
you
could
end
up
with
a
new
form
of
tennis
elbow
from
have
to
swap
floppy
disk
in
and
out
of
the
single
drive
in
addition
the
macintosh
lack
a
fan
another
example
of
job
s
dogmatic
stubbornness
fan
he
felt
detract
from
the
calm
of
a
computer
this
cause
many
component
failure
and
earn
the
macintosh
the
nickname
the
beige
toaster
which
do
not
enhance
its
popularity
it
be
so
seductive
that
it
have
sell
well
enough
for
the
first
few
month
but
when
people
become
more
aware
of
its
limitation
sale
fell
as
hoffman
later
lament
the
reality
distortion
field
can
serve
as
a
spur
but
then
reality
itself
hit
at
the
end
of
with
lisa
sale
virtually
nonexistent
and
macintosh
sale
fall
below
ten
thousand
a
month
job
make
a
shoddy
and
atypical
decision
out
of
desperation
he
decide
to
take
the
inventory
of
unsold
lisas
graft
on
a
macintosh
emulation
program
and
sell
them
as
a
new
product
the
macintosh
xl
since
the
lisa
have
be
discontinue
and
would
not
be
restart
it
be
an
unusual
instance
of
job
produce
something
that
he
do
not
believe
in
i
be
furious
because
the
mac
xl
wasn
t
real
say
hoffman
it
be
just
to
blow
the
excess
lisas
out
the
door
it
sell
well
and
then
we
have
to
discontinue
the
horrible
hoax
so
i
resign
the
dark
mood
be
evident
in
the
ad
that
be
developed
in
january
which
be
suppose
to
reprise
the
anti
ibm
sentiment
of
the
resonant
ad
unfortunately
there
be
a
fundamental
difference
the
first
ad
have
end
on
a
heroic
optimistic
note
but
the

positive

instead

merely

every

who
have
bought
an
ibm

ask
for

be
some
people
who
be
innately
curious
forever
little
kid
in
their
awe
of
life
but
they
re
rare
the
interview
touch
on
many
subject
but
job
s
most
poignant
rumination
be
about
grow
old
and
face
the
future
your
thought
construct
pattern
like
scaffold
in
your
mind
you
be
really
etch
chemical
pattern
in
most
case
people
get
stuck
in
those
pattern
just
like
groove
in
a
record
and
they
never
get
out
of
them
i
ll
always
stay
connect
with
apple
i
hope
that
throughout
my
life
i
ll
sort
of
have
the
thread
of
my
life
and
the
thread
of
apple
weave
in
and
out
of
each
other
like
a
tapestry
there
may
be
a
few
year
when
i
m
not
there
but
i
ll
always
come
back
if
you
want
to
live
your
life
in
a
creative
way
as
an
artist
you
have
to
not
look
back
too
much
you
have
to
be
willing
to
take
whatever
you
ve
do
and
whoever
you
be
and
throw
them
away
the
more
the
outside
world
try
to
reinforce
an
image
of
you
the
harder
it
be
to
continue
to
be
an
artist
which
be
why
a
lot
of
time
artist
have
to
say
bye
i
have
to
go
i
m
go
crazy
and
i
m
get
out
of
here
and
they
go
and
hibernate
somewhere
maybe
later
they
re
emerge
a
little
differently
with
each
of
those
statement
job
seem
to
have
a
premonition
that
his
life
would
soon
be
change
perhaps
the
thread
of
his
life
would
indeed
weave
in
and
out
of
the
thread
of
apple
s
perhaps
it
be
time
to
throw
away
some
of
what
he
have
be
perhaps
it
be
time
to
say
bye
i
have
to
go
and
then
reemerge
later
think
differently

so
frustrate
that

wither
but
he

try
to
look
amuse
at
hertzfeld
s
assessment
if
you
really
believe
that
i
don
t
think
there
s
any
way
that
i
can

hertzfeld
didn

come
back
by
early
burrell

out
of
it
the
reality
distortion
field
be
usually
too
strong
for
him
to
resist
so
he
plot
with
hertzfeld
how
he
could
break
free
of
it
i
ve
get
it
he
told
hertzfeld
one
day
i
know

distortion
field
i
ll
just
walk
into
steve
s
office
pull
down
my
pant
and
urinate
on
his
desk
what
could
he
say
to
that
it
s
guaranteed
to
work
the
bet
on
the
mac
team
be
that
even
brave
burrell
smith
would
not
have
the
gumption
to
do
that
when
he

him
a
look
and
smith
decide
it
wasn
t
necessary
so
he
resign
less
dramatically
and
walk
out
on
good
term
he
be
quickly
follow
by
another
of
the

but
the
big
news
that
month
be
the
departure
from
apple
yet
again
of
its
cofounder
steve
wozniak
wozniak
be
then
quietly
work
as
a
midlevel
engineer
in
the
apple
ii
division
serve
as
a
humble
mascot
of
the
root
of
the
company
and
stay
as
far
away
from
management
and
corporate
politics
as
he
could
he
felt
with
justification
that
job
be
not
appreciative
of
the
apple
ii
which
remain
the
cash
cow
of
the
company
and
account
for
of
its
sale
at
christmas
people
in
the
apple
ii
group
be
be
treat
as
very
unimportant
by
the
rest
of
the
company
he
later
say
this
be
despite
the
fact
that
the
apple
ii
be
by
far
the
large
sell
product
in
our
company
for
age
and
would
be
for
year
to
come
he
even
rouse
himself
to
do
something
out
of
character
he
picked
up
the
phone
one
day
and
call
sculley
berating
him
for
lavish
so
much
attention
on
job
and
the
macintosh
division
frustrate
wozniak
decide
to
leave
quietly
to
start
a
new
company
that
would
make
a
universal
remote
control
device
he
have
invent
it
would
control
your
television
stereo
and
other
electronic
device
with
a
simple
set
of
button
that
you
could
easily
program
he
inform
the
head
of
engineering
at
the
apple
ii
division
but
he
didn
t
feel
he
be
important
enough
to
go
out
of
channel
and
tell
job
or
markkula
so
job
first
heard
about
it
when
the
news
leak
in
the
wall
street
journal
in
his
earnest
way
wozniak
have
openly
answer
the
reporter
s
question
when
he
call
yes
he
say
he
felt
that
apple
have
be
give
short
shrift
to
the
apple
ii
division
apple
s
direction
have
be
horrendously
wrong
for
five
year
he
say
less
than
two
week
later
wozniak
and
job
travel
together
to
the
white
house
where
ronald
reagan
present
them
with
the
first
national
medal
of
technology
the
president
quote
what
president
rutherford
hayes
have
say
when
first
show
a
telephone
an
amaze
invention
but
who
would
ever
want
to
use
one
and
then
quipped
i
thought
at
the
time
that
he
might
be
mistaken
because
of
the
awkward
situation
surround
wozniak
s
departure
apple
do
not
throw
a
celebratory
dinner
so
job
and
wozniak
go
for
a
walk
afterward
and
ate
at
a
sandwich
shop
they
chat
amiably
wozniak
recall
and
avoid
any
discussion
of
their
disagreement
wozniak
want
to
make
the
part
amicable
it
be
his
style
so
he
agree
to
stay
on
as
a
part
time
apple
employee
at
a
salary
and
represent
the
company
at
event
and
trade
show
that
could
have
be
a
graceful
way
to
drift
apart
but
job
could
not
leave
well
enough
alone
one
saturday
a
few
week
after
they
have
visit
washington
together
job
go
to
the
new
palo
alto
studio
of
hartmut
esslinger
whose
company
frogdesign
have
move
there
to
handle
its
design
work
for
apple
there
he
happen
to
see
sketch
that
the
firm
have
make
for
wozniak
s
new
remote
control
device
and
he
flew
into
a
rage
apple
have
a
clause
in
its
contract
that
give
it
the
right
to
bar
frogdesign
from
work
on
other
computer
related
project
and
job
invoked
it
i
inform
them
he
recall
that
work
with
woz
wouldn
t
be
acceptable
to
us
when
the
wall
street
journal
heard
what
happen
it
get
in
touch
with
wozniak
who
as
usual
be
open
and
honest
he
say
that
job
be
punish
him
steve
job
have
a
hate
for
me
probably
because
of
the
thing
i
say
about
apple
he
told
the
reporter
job
s
action
be
remarkably
petty
but
it
be
also
partly
cause
by
the
fact
that
he
understood
in
way
that
others
do
not
that
the
look
and
style
of
a
product
serve
to
brand
it
a
device
that
have
wozniak
s
name
on
it
and
use
the
same
design
language
as
apple
s
product
might
be
mistaken
for
something
that
apple
have

not
personal
job
told
the
newspaper

that
he

that
wozniak
s
remote
wouldn
t
look
like
something

by
apple
we
don
t
want
to
see
our
design
language
use
on
other
product
woz
have
to
find
his
own
resource
he
can
t
leverage
off
apple

resource
we
can
t
treat
him
specially
job
volunteer
to
pay
for
the
work
that
frogdesign
have
already
do
for
wozniak
but
even
so
the
executive
at
the
firm
be
take
aback
when
job
demand
that
they
send
him
the

or
destroy

they

pfeifer

hertzfeld

outrage
when
he
heard
what
job
have

he
live
about
twelve
block
from
job
who
sometimes
would
drop
by
on
his
walk
i
get
so
furious
about
the
wozniak
remote
episode
that
when
steve
next
come
over
i
wouldn
t
let
him
in
the
house
hertzfeld
recall
he
knew
he
be
wrong
but
he
try
to
rationalize
and
maybe
in
his
distort
reality
he
be
able
to
wozniak
always
a
teddy
bear
even
when
annoyed
hire
another

firm
and
even

showdown
spring
there
be
many
reason
for
the
rift
between
job
and
sculley
in
the
spring
of
some
be
merely
business
disagreement
such
as
sculley
s
attempt

maximize
profit
by
keep
the
macintosh
price
high
when
job
want
to
make
it
more
affordable
others
be
weirdly
psychological
and
stem
from
the
torrid
and
unlikely
infatuation
they
initially
have
with

when

breach
have
two
fundamental
cause
one
on
each
side
for
job
the
problem
be
that
sculley
never
become
a
product
person
he
didn
t
make
the
effort
or
show
the
capacity
to
understand
the
fine
point
of
what
they
be
make
on
the
contrary
he
found
job
s
passion
for
tiny
technical
tweak
and
design
detail
to
be
obsessive
and
counterproductive
he
have
spent
his
career
sell
soda
and
snack
whose
recipe
be
largely
irrelevant
to
him
he
wasn
t
naturally
passionate
about
product
which
be
among
the
most
damn
sin
that
job
could
imagine
i
try
to
educate
him
about
the
detail
of
engineering
job
recall
but
he
have
no
idea
how
product
be
create
and
after
a
while
it
just
turn
into
argument
but
i
learn
that
my
perspective
be
right
product
be
everything
he
come
to
see
sculley
as
clueless
and
his
contempt
be
exacerbate
by
sculley
s
hunger
for
his
affection
and
delusion
that
they
be
very
similar
for
sculley
the
problem
be
that
job
when
he
be
no
longer
in
courtship
or
manipulative
mode
be
frequently
obnoxious
rude
selfish
and
nasty
to
other
people
he
found
job
s
boorish
behavior
as
despicable
as
job
found
sculley
s
lack
of
passion
for
product
detail
sculley
be
kind
care
and
polite
to
a
fault
at
one
point
they
be
planning
to
meet
with
xerox
s
vice
chair
bill
glavin
and
sculley
beg
job
to
behave
but
as
soon
as
they
sat
down
job
told
glavin
you
guy
don
t
have
any
clue
what
you
re
do
and
the
meeting
broke
up
i
m
sorry
but
i
couldn
t
help
myself
job
told
sculley
it
be
one
of
many
such
case
as
atari
s
al
alcorn
later
observe
sculley
believe
in

people
happy
and
worry
about
relationship
steve
didn
t
give
a
shit
about
that
but
he
do
care
about
the
product
in
a
way
that
sculley
never
could
and
he
be
able
to
avoid
have
too

at

shock
sculley
have
already
left
and

toward
sculley
why

me
he
say
he
betrayed
me
then

with
sculley
he
say
john

realistic
in
the
new
organization
plan
sculley
have
tapped
her
to
run
the
manufacturing

some
of
the

listen
with
one
proviso
job
have
to
keep
quiet
i
seriously
want
to
hear
the
thought
of

enlist
them
in
a
rebellion
he
recall
as
it

they
go
inside
the
sparsely
furnish
mansion
and
sat
by
a
fireplace
instead
of
let
it
turn
into
a
gripe
session
markkula
make
them
focus
on
very
specific
management
issue
such
as
what
have
cause
the
problem
in
produce
the
fileserver
software
and
why
the

not
respond
well
to
the
change
in
demand
when
they
be
finish
markkula
bluntly
decline
to
back
job
i
say
i

be
the

recall
sculley

the
bos
they
be
mad
and
emotional
and
put
together
a
revolt
but
that
s
not
how
you
do
thing
tuesday
may
his
ire
stoke
by
hearing
from
markkula
that

over
control
of
job

and
there
be
no
other
division
for
job
to
run

be
still
somewhat
conciliatory
he
told
job
that
he
could
stay
on
with
the
title
of
board
chairman
and
be
a
product
visionary
with
no
operational
duty
but
by
this
point
even
the
idea
of
start
a
skunkworks
such
as

be
no
longer
on
the
table
it
finally

then
he
hung
up
murray
be
worried
that

be
so
despondent
he
might
do
something
rash
so
he
call
back
there
be
no
answer
so
he
drove
to
woodside
no
one
come
to
the
door
when
he
knock
so
he
go
around

exterior
step
and
look
in

lie
there
on
a
mattress
in
his
unfurnished

in
on
friday
for
sculley
s
announcement
of
the
reorganization
plan
there
be
no
option
left
other
than
to
play
the
good
soldier
rather
than
the
renegade
commander
like
a
roll
stone
job
slip
quietly
into
the
back
row
of
the
auditorium
to
listen
to
sculley
explain
to
the
troop
the
new
order
of
battle
there
be
a
lot
of
sideways
glance
but
few
people
acknowledge
him
and
none
come
over
to
provide
public
display
of
affection
he
star
without
blinking
at
sculley
who
would
remember
steve
s
look
of
contempt
year
later
it
s
unyielding
sculley
recall
like
an
x
ray
boring
inside
your
bone
down
to
where
you
re
soft
and
destructibly
mortal
for
a
moment
stand
onstage
while
pretend
not
to
notice
job
sculley
thought
back
to
a
friendly
trip
they
have
take
a
year
earlier
to
cambridge
massachusetts
to
visit
job
s
hero
edwin
land
he
have
be
dethrone
from
the
company
he
create
polaroid
and
job
have
say
to
sculley
in
disgust
all
he
do
be
blow
a
lousy
few
million
and
they
take
his
company
away
from
him
now
sculley
reflect
he
be
take
job
s
company
away
from
him
as
sculley
go
over
the
organizational
chart
he
introduce
gas
e
as
the
new
head
of
a
combine
macintosh
and
apple
ii
product
group
on
the
chart
be
a
small
box
label
chairman
with
no
line
connect
to
it
not
to
sculley
or
to
anyone
else
sculley
briefly
note
that
in
that
role
job
would
play
the
part
of
global
visionary
but
he
didn
t
acknowledge
job
s
presence
there
be
a
smatter
of
awkward
applause
job
stayed
home
for
the
next
few
day
blind
drawn
his
answer
machine
on
see
only
his
girlfriend
tina
redse
for
hour
on
end
he
sat
there
play
his
bob
dylan
tape
especially
the
time
they
be
a
changin
he
have
recite
the
second
verse
the
day
he
unveiled
the
macintosh
to
the
apple
shareholder
sixteen
month
earlier
that
verse
end
nicely
for
the
loser
now
will
be
later
to
win
a
rescue
squad
from
his
former
macintosh
posse
arrive
to
dispel
the
gloom
on
sunday
night
lead
by
andy
hertzfeld
and
bill
atkinson
job
take
a
while
to
answer
their
knock
and
then
he
lead
them
to
a
room
next
to
the
kitchen
that
be
one
of
the
few
place
with
any
furniture
with
redse
s
help
he
serve
some
vegetarian
food
he
have
order
so
what
really
happen
hertzfeld
ask
be
it
really
as
bad
as
it
look
no
it
s
bad
job
grimace
it
s
much
bad
than
you
can
imagine
he
blame
sculley
for
betraying
him
and
say
that
apple
would
not
be
able
to
manage
without
him
his
role
as
chairman
he
complain
be
completely
ceremonial
he
be
be
eject
from
his
bandley
office
to
a
small
and
almost
empty
building
he
nickname
siberia
hertzfeld
turn
the
topic
to
happier
day
and
they
begin
to
reminisce
about
the
past
earlier
that
week
dylan
have
release
a
new
album
empire
burlesque
and
hertzfeld
brought
a
copy
that
they
played
on
job
s
high
tech
turntable
the
most
notable
track
when
the
night
come
fall
from
the
sky
with
its
apocalyptic
message
seem
appropriate
for
the
even
but
job
didn
t
like
it
it
sound
almost
disco
and
he
gloomily
argue
that
dylan
have
be
go
downhill
since
blood
on
the
track
so
hertzfeld
move
the
needle
to
the
last
song
on
the
album
dark
eye
which
be
a
simple
acoustic
number
feature
dylan
alone
on
guitar
and
harmonica
it
be
slow
and
mournful
and
hertzfeld
hop
would
remind
job
of
the
earlier
dylan
track
he
so
love
but
job
didn
t
like
that
song
either
and
have
no
desire
to
hear
the
rest
of
the
album
job
s
overwrought
reaction
be
understandable
sculley
have
once
be
a
father
figure
to
him
so
have
mike
markkula
so
have
arthur
rock
that
week
all
three
have
abandon
him
it
get
back
to
the
deep
feel
of
be
reject
at
an
early
age
his
friend
and
lawyer
george
riley
later
say
it
s
a
deep
part
of
his
own
mythology
and
it
defines
to
himself
who
he
be
job
recall
year
later
i
felt
like
i
d
be
punch
the
air
knock
out
of
me
and
i
couldn
t
breathe
lose
the
support
of
arthur
rock
be
especially
painful
arthur
have
be
like
a
father
to
me
job
say
he
take
me
under
his
wing
rock
have
taught
him
about
opera
and
he
and
his
wife
toni
have
be
his
host
in
san
francisco
and
aspen
i
remember
drive
into
san
francisco
one
time
and
i
say
to
him
god
that
bank
of
america
building
be
ugly
and
he
say
no
it
s
the
best
and
he
proceed
to
lecture
me
and
he
be
right
of
course
year
later
job
s
eye
well
with
tear
as
he
recount
the
story
he
chose
sculley
over
me
that
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
i
never
thought
he
would
abandon
me
make
matter
bad
be
that
his
beloved
company
be
now
in
the
hand
of
a
man
he
consider
a
bozo
the
board
felt
that
i
couldn
t
run
a
company
and
that
be
their
decision
to
make
he
say
but
they
make
one
mistake
they
should
have
separate
the
decision
of
what
to
do
with
me
and
what
to
do
with
sculley
they
should
have
fire
sculley
even
if
they
didn
t
think
i
be
ready
to
run
apple
even
as
his
personal
gloom
slowly
lift
his
anger
at
sculley
his
feel
of
betrayal
deepen
the
situation
worsen
when
sculley
told
a
group
of
analyst
that
he
consider
job
irrelevant
to
the
company
despite
his
title
as
chairman
from
an
operation
standpoint
there
be
no
role
either
today
or
in
the
future
for
steve
job
he
say
i
don
t
know
what
he
ll
do
the
blunt
comment
shock
the
group
and
a
gasp
go
through
the
auditorium
perhaps
get
away
to
europe
would
help
job
thought
so
in
june
he
go
to
paris
where
he
spoke
at
an
apple
event
and
go
to

from
there

go
to
italy
where
he
drove
the
hill
of
tuscany
with
redse
and
bought
a
bike
so
he
could
spend
time
rid
by
himself
in
florence
he
soak
in
the
architecture
of
the
city
and
the
texture
of
the
building
material
particularly
memorable
be
the
pave
stone
which
come
from
il
casone
quarry
near
the
tuscan
town
of
firenzuola
they
be
a
calm
bluish
gray
twenty
year
later
he
would
decide
that
the
floor
of
most
major
apple
store
would
be
make
of
this
sandstone
the
apple

he
be
in
the

come
just
in
time
for
the
september
apple
board
meeting
although

nominally
the

he

since
he
lose
power
he
call
sculley
say
he
be
go
to
attend
and
ask
that
an
item
be
add
to
the
end
of
the
agenda
for
a
chairman
s
report
he
didn
t
say
what
it
be
about
and
sculley
assume
it
would
be
a
criticism
of
the
late
reorganization
instead
when
his
turn
come
to
speak
job
described
to
the
board
his
plan
to
start
a
new

i

and
it
s
time
for
me
to
get
on
with
my
life
he
begin
it
s
obvious
that
i
ve
get
to
do
something
i
m
thirty
year
old
then
he
refer
to
some
prepared
note
to
describe
his
plan
to
create
a
computer
for
the
high
education
market
the
new
company
would
not
be
competitive
with
apple
he
promise
and
he
would
take
with
him
only
a
handful
of
non
key
personnel
he
offer
to
resign
as
chairman
of
apple
but
he
express
hope
that
they
could
work
together
perhaps
apple
would
want
to
buy
the
distribution
right
to
his
product
he
suggest
or
license
macintosh
software
to
it
mike
markkula
rankle
at
the
possibility
that
job
would
hire
anyone
from
apple
why
would
you
take
anyone
at
all
he
ask
don
t
get
upset
job
assure
him
and
the
rest
of
the
board
these
be
very
low
level
people
that
you
won
t
miss
and
they
will
be
leave
anyway
the
board
initially
seem
dispose
to
wish
job
well
in
his
venture
after
a
private
discussion
the
director
even
propose
that
apple
take
a
stake
in
the
new
company
and
that
job
remain
on
the
board
that
night
job
and
his
five
renegade
met
again
at
his
house
for
dinner
he
be
in
favor
of
take
the
apple
investment
but
the
others
convince
him
it
be
unwise
they
also
agree
that
it
would
be
best
if
they
resign
all
at
once
right
away
then
they
could
make
a
clean
break
so
job
write
a
formal
letter
tell
sculley
the
name
of
the
five
who
would
be
leave
sign
it
in
his
spidery
lowercase
signature
and
drove
to
apple
the
next
morning
to
hand
it
to
him
before
his
staff
meeting
steve
these
be
not
low
level
people
sculley
say
well
these
people
be
go
to
resign
anyway
job
reply
they
be
go
to
be
hand
in
their
resignation
by
nine
this
morning
from
job
s
perspective
he
have
be
honest
the
five
be
not
division
manager
or
member
of
sculley
s
top
team
they
have
all
felt
diminish
in
fact
by
the
company
s
new
organization
but
from
sculley
s
perspective
these
be
important
player
page
be
an
apple
fellow
and
lewin
be
a
key
to
the
high
education
market
in
addition
they
knew
about
the
plan
for
big
mac
even
though
it
have
be
shelve
this
be
still
proprietary
information
nevertheless
sculley
be
sanguine
instead
of
push
the
point
he
ask
job
to
remain
on
the
board
job
reply
that
he
would
think
about
it
but
when
sculley
walk
into
his
staff
meeting
and
told
his
top
lieutenant
who
be
leave
there
be
an
uproar
most
of
them
felt
that
job
have
breach
his
duty
as
chairman
and
displayed
stun
disloyalty
to
the
company
we
should
expose
him
for
the
fraud
that
he
be
so
that
people
here
stop
regard
him
as
a
messiah
campbell
shout
accord
to
sculley
campbell
admit
that
although
he
later
become
a
great
job
defender
and
supportive
board
member
he
be
ballistic
that
morning
i
be
fuck
furious
especially
about
him
take
dan
l
lewin
he
recall
dan
l
have
built
the
relationship
with
the
university
he
be
always
mutter
about
how
hard
it
be
to
work
with
steve
and
then
he
left
campbell
be
so
angry
that
he
walk
out
of
the
meeting
to
call
lewin
at

when
his
wife
say

be
true
lewin
acknowledge
it
be
campbell
hung
up
without
say
another
word
after
hearing
the
fury
of
his
senior
staff
sculley
survey
the
member
of
the
board
they
likewise
felt
that

have
mislead
them
with
his
pledge
that
he
would
not
raid
important
employee
arthur

be
especially
angry
even
though
he
have
side
with
sculley
during
the
memorial
day
showdown
he
have
be
able
to
repair
his
paternal
relationship
with

just
the
week
before
he
have
invite
job
to
bring
his
girlfriend
up
to

he
come
to
the
board
and
lie
to
us

up
before

left
that
s
not
the
way
you
do

it
be
ungentlemanly
over
the
weekend
both
the
board
and
the
executive

convince
sculley
that

think
that
thing
might
proceed
smoothly
so
he
have
kept
quiet
but
after
reading
the
newspaper
he
felt
that
he
have
to
respond
he
phone
a
few
favor
reporter
and
invite
them
to
his

she
told
him
finally
he
back
down
he
decide
that
he
would
give
the
reporter
a
copy
of
the
resignation

limit
any

few
bland
statement
job
have
consider
just

but
susan
barnes
convince
him
that
this
would
be
too
contemptuous
instead
he
drove
it
to
markkula

house
where
he
also
found
al
eisenstat

defer
it
for
a
week
i
agree
to

in
light
of
the
encouragement
the
board
offer
with
regard
to
the
propose
new
venture
and
the
indication
that

who
would

willingness

subsequently
the
company
appear
to
be
adopt
a
hostile
posture
toward
me
and
the
new
venture
accordingly
i
must
insist
upon
the
immediate
acceptance
of
my
resignation
as
you
know
the
company
s
recent
reorganization

and
no
access
even
to

report
i
be
but
and
want
still
to
contribute
and
achieve
after
what
we
have
accomplish
together
i
would
wish
our
part
to

the
interview
he
give
be
reveal
what
i

remember
apple
like
any
man
remembers
the
first
woman
he
s
fall
in
love
with
but
he
be
also
willing
to
fight
with
its
management
if
need
be
when
someone
call
you
a
thief
in
public
you
have
to
respond
apple
s
threat
to
sue
him
be
outrageous
it
be
also
sad
it
show
that
apple
be
no
longer
a
confident
rebellious
company
it
s
hard
to
think
that
a
billion
company
with
employee
couldn
t
compete
with
six
people
in
blue
jean
to
try
to
counter
job
s
spin
sculley
call
wozniak
and
urge
him
to
speak
out
steve
can
be
an
insult
and
hurtful
guy
he
told
time
that
week
he
reveal
that
job
have
ask
him
to
join
his
new
firm
it
would
have
be
a
sly
way
to
land
another
blow
against
apple
s
current
management
but
he
want
no
part
of
such
game
and
have
not
return
job
s
phone
call
to
the
san
francisco
chronicle
he
recount
how
job
have
block
frogdesign
from
work
on
his
remote
control
under
the
pretense
that
it
might
compete
with
apple
product
i
look
forward
to
a
great
product
and
i
wish
him
success
but
his
integrity
i
cannot
trust
wozniak
say
to
be
on
your
own
the
best
thing
ever
to
happen
to
steve
be
when
we
fire
him
told
him
to
get
lose
arthur
rock
later
say
the
theory
share
by
many
be
that
the
tough
love
make
him
wiser
and
more
mature
but
it
s
not
that
simple
at
the
company
he
found
after
be
oust
from
apple
job
be
able
to
indulge
all
of
his
instinct
both
good
and
bad
he
be
unbound
the
result
be
a
series
of
spectacular
product
that
be
dazzle
market
flop
this
be
the
true
learn
experience
what
prepared
him
for
the
great
success
he
would
have
in
act
iii
be
not
his
ouster
from
his
act
i
at
apple
but
his
brilliant
failure
in
act
ii
the
first
instinct
that
he
indulge
be
his
passion
for
design
the
name
he
chose
for
his
new
company
be
rather
straightforward
next
in
order
to
make
it
more
distinctive
he
decide
he
need
a
world
class
logo
so
he
court
the
dean
of
corporate
logo
paul
rand
at
seventy
one
the
brooklyn
born
graphic
designer
have
already
create
some
of
the
best
know
logo
in
business
include
those
of
esquire
ibm
westinghouse
abc
and
ups
he
be
under
contract
to
ibm
and
his
supervisor
there
say
that
it
would
obviously
be
a
conflict
for
him
to
create
a
logo
for
another
computer
company
so
job
picked
up
the
phone
and
call
ibm
s
ceo
john
akers
akers
be
out
of
town
but
job
be
so
persistent
that
he
be
finally
put
through
to
vice
chairman
paul
rizzo
after
two
day
rizzo
conclude
that
it
be
futile
to
resist
job
and
he
give
permission
for
rand
to
do
the
work
rand
flew
out
to
palo
alto
and
spent
time
walk
with
job
and
listen
to
his
vision
the
computer
would
be
a
cube
job
pronounce
he
love
that
shape
it
be
perfect
and
simple
so
rand
decide
that
the
logo
should
be
a
cube
as
well
one
that
be
tilt
at
a
angle
when
job
ask
for
a
number
of
option
to
consider
rand
declare
that
he
do
not
create
different
option
for
client
i
will
solve
your
problem
and
you
will
pay
me
he
told
job
you
can
use
what
i
produce
or
not
but
i
will
not
do
option
and
either
way
you
will
pay
me
job
admire
that
kind
of
think
so
he
make
what
be
quite
a
gamble
the
company
would
pay
an
astonish
flat
fee
to
get
one
design
there
be
a
clarity
in
our
relationship
job
say
he
have
a
purity
as
an
artist
but
he
be
astute
at
solve
business
problem
he
have
a
tough
exterior
and
have
perfect
the
image
of
a
curmudgeon
but
he
be
a
teddy
bear
inside
it
be
one
of
job
s
high
praise
purity
as
an
artist
it
take
rand
just
two
week
he
flew
back
to
deliver
the
result
to
job
at
his
woodside
house
first
they
have
dinner
then
rand
hand
him
an
elegant
and
vibrant
booklet
that
described
his
thought
process
on
the
final
spread
rand
present
the
logo
he
have
chosen
in
its
design
color
arrangement
and
orientation
the
logo
be
a
study
in
contrast
his
booklet
proclaim
tipped
at
a
jaunty
angle
it
brim
with
the
informality
friendliness
and
spontaneity
of
a
christmas
seal
and
the
authority
of
a
rubber
stamp
the
word
next
be
split
into
two
line
to
fill
the
square
face
of
the
cube
with
only
the
e
in
lowercase
that
letter
stood
out
rand
s
booklet
explain
to
connote
education
excellence
e
mc
it
be
often
hard
to
predict
how
job
would
react
to
a
presentation
he
could
label
it
shitty
or
brilliant
one
never
knew
which
way
he
might
go
but
with
a
legendary
designer
such
as
rand
the
chance
be
that
job
would
embrace
the
proposal
he
star
at
the
final
spread
look
up
at
rand
and
then
hug
him
they
have
one
minor
disagreement
rand
have
use
a
dark
yellow
for
the
e
in
the
logo
and
job
want
him
to
change
it
to
a
brighter
and
more
traditional
yellow
rand
bang
his
fist
on
the
table
and
declare
i
ve
be
do
this
for
fifty
year
and
i
know
what
i
m
do
job
relent
the
company
have
not
only
a
new
logo
but
a
new
name
no
longer
be
it
next
it
be
next
others
might
not
have
understood
the
need
to
ob
over
a
logo
much
less
pay
for
one
but
for
job
it
meant
that
next
be
start
life
with
a
world
class
feel
and
identity
even
if
it
hadn
t
yet

its
first
product
as
markkula
have
taught
him
a
great
company
must
be
able
to
impute
its
value
from
the
first
impression
it
make
as
a
bonus
rand
agree
to
design
a
personal
call
card
for
job
he
come
up
with
a
colorful
type
treatment
which
job
like
but
they
end
up
have
a
lengthy
and
heat
disagreement
about
the
placement
of
the
period
after
the
p
in
steven
p
job
rand

place
the

it
would
appear

to

to
the
left
under
the
curve
of
the
p
as
be
possible
with
digital
typography
it
be

fairly
large
argument
about
something
relatively
small

kare
recall
on
this
one
job
prevail
in
order
to

an
industrial

to
a

but
none
of
them

as

that

not
keep
job
from
try
at
the
begin
of
november
just
five
week
after
apple
file
suit
against
him
job
write
to
eisenstat
and
ask
for
a
dispensation
i
spoke
with
hartmut
esslinger
this
weekend
and
he
suggest
i
write
you
a
note
express
why
i
wish
to
work
with
him
and
frogdesign
on
the
new
product
for
next
he
say
astonishingly
job
s
argument
be
that
he
do
not
know
what
apple
have
in
the
work
but
esslinger
do
next
have
no
knowledge
as
to
the
current
or
future
direction
of
apple
s
product
design
nor
do
other
design
firm
we
might
deal
with
so
it
be
possible
to
inadvertently
design
similar
look
product
it
be
in
both
apple
s
and
next
s
best
interest
to
rely
on
hartmut
s
professionalism
to
make
sure
this
do
not
occur
eisenstat
recall
be
flabbergast
by
job
s
audacity
and
he
reply
curtly
i
have
previously
express
my
concern
on
behalf
of
apple
that
you
be
engage
in
a
business
course
which
involves
your
utilization
of
apple
s
confidential
business
information
he
write
your
letter
do
not
alleviate
my
concern
in
any
way
in
fact
it
heightens
my
concern
because
it
state
that
you
have
no
knowledge
as
to
the
current
or
future
direction
of
apple
s
product
design
a
statement
which
be
not
true
what
make
the
request
all
the
more
astonish
to
eisenstat
be
that
it
be
job
who
just
a
year
earlier
have
force
frogdesign
to
abandon
its
work
on
wozniak
s
remote
control
device
job
realize
that
in
order
to
work
with
esslinger
and
for
a
variety
of
other
reason
it
would
be
necessary
to
resolve
the
lawsuit
that
apple
have
file
fortunately
sculley
be
willing
in
january
they
reach
an
out
of
court
agreement
involve
no
financial
damage
in
return
for
apple
s
drop
its
suit
next
agree
to
a
variety
of
restriction
its
product
would
be
market
as
a
high
end
workstation
it
would
be
sell
directly
to
college
and
university
and
it
would
not
ship
before
march
apple
also
insist
that
the
next
machine
not
use
an
operating
system
compatible
with
the
macintosh
though
it
could
be
argue
that
apple
would
have
be
well
serve
by
insist
on
just
the
opposite
after
the
settlement
job
continued
to
court
esslinger
until
the
designer
decide
to
wind
down
his
contract
with
apple
that
allow
frogdesign
to
work
with
next
at
the
end
of
esslinger
insist
on
have
free
rein
just
as
paul
rand
have
sometimes
you
have
to
use
a
big
stick
with
steve
he
say
like
rand
esslinger
be
an
artist
so
job
be
willing
to
grant
him
indulgence
he
deny
other
mortal
job
decreed
that
the
computer
should
be
an
absolutely
perfect
cube
with
each
side
exactly
a
foot
long
and
every
angle
precisely
degree
he
like
cube
they
have
gravitas
but
also
the
slight
whiff
of
a
toy
but
the
next
cube
be
a
jobsian
example
of
design
desire
trump
engineering
consideration
the
circuit
board
which
fit
nicely
into
the
traditional
pizza
box
shape
have
to
be
reconfigured
and
stack
in
order
to
nestle
into
a
cube
even
bad
the
perfection
of
the
cube
make
it
hard
to
manufacture
most
part
that
be
cast
in
mold
have
angle
that
be
slightly
great
than
pure
degree
so
that
it
s
easy
to
get
them
out
of
the
mold
just
as
it
be
easy
to
get
a
cake
out
of
a
pan
that
have
angle
slightly
great
than
degree
but
esslinger
dictate
and
job
enthusiastically
agree
that
there
would
be
no
such
draft
angle
that
would
ruin
the
purity
and
perfection
of
the
cube
so
the
side
have
to
be
produce
separately
use
mold
that
cost
at
a
specialty
machine
shop
in
chicago
job
s
passion
for
perfection
be
out
of
control
when
he
notice
a
tiny
line
in
the
chassis
cause
by
the
mold
something
that
any
other
computer
maker
would
accept
as
unavoidable
he
flew
to
chicago
and
convince
the
die
caster
to
start
over
and
do
it
perfectly
not
a
lot
of
die
caster
expect
a
celebrity
to
fly
in
note
one
of
the
engineer
job
also
have
the
company
buy
a
sand
machine
to
remove
all
line
where
the
mold
face
met
and
insist
that
the
magnesium
case
be
a
matte
black
which
make
it
more
susceptible
to
show
blemish
job
have
always
indulge
his
obsession
that
the
unseen
part
of
a
product
should
be
craft
as
beautifully
as
its
fa
ade
just
as
his
father
have
taught
him
when
they
be
building
a
fence
this
too
he
take
to
extreme
when
he
found
himself
unfettered
at
next
he
make
sure
that
the
screw
inside
the
machine
have
expensive
plat
he
even
insist
that
the
matte
black
finish
be
coat
onto
the
inside
of
the
cube
s
case
even
though
only
repairman
would
see
it
joe
nocera
then
write
for
esquire
capture
job
s
intensity
at
a
next
staff
meeting
it
s
not
quite
right
to
say
that
he
be
sit
through
this
staff
meeting
because
job
doesn
t
sit
through
much
of
anything
one
of
the
way
he
dominates
be
through
sheer
movement
one
moment
he
s
kneel
in
his
chair
the
next
minute
he
s
slouch
in
it
the
next
he
have
leap
out
of
his
chair
entirely
and
be
scribble
on
the
blackboard
directly
behind
him
he
be
full
of
mannerism
he
bite
his
nail
he
stare
with
unnerve
earnestness
at
whoever
be
speak
his
hand
which
be
slightly
and
inexplicably
yellow
be
in
constant
motion
what
particularly
struck
nocera
be
job
s
almost
willful
lack
of
tact
it
be
more
than
just
an
inability
to
hide
his
opinion
when
others
say
something
he
thought
dumb
it
be
a
conscious
readiness
even
a
perverse
eagerness
to
put
people
down
humiliate
them
show
he
be
smarter
when
dan
l
lewin
hand
out
an
organization
chart
for
example
job
roll
his
eye
these
chart
be
bullshit
he
interject
yet
his
mood
still
swung
wildly
as
at
apple
a
finance
person
come
into
the
meeting
and
job
lavish
praise
on
him
for
a
really
really
great
job
on
this
the
previous
day
job

told
him
this
deal

the

the
process

in

in
even
though

new
job
insist
that
the

job
commission
i
m
pei
to

a
grand
staircase
that
seem
to
float
in
the

the
contractor
say
it
couldn
t
be
built
job
say
it
could
and
it
be
year
later
job
would
make
such
staircase
a
feature
at
apple
s
signature
store
the

during
the
early
month
of
next
job
and
dan
l
lewin
go
on
the
road
often
accompany
by
a
few
colleague
to
visit
campus
and
solicit
opinion
at
harvard
they
met
with
mitch
kapor
the
chairman
of
lotus
software
over
dinner
at
harvest
restaurant
when
kapor
begin
slather
butter
on
his
bread
job
ask
him
have
you
ever
heard
of

kapor
respond
i
ll
make
you
a
deal
you
stay
away
from
comment
on
my
dietary
habit
and
i
will
stay
away
from
the
subject
of
your
personality
it
be
meant
humorously
but
as
kapor
later
comment
human
relationship
be
not
his
strong
suit
lotus
agree
to
write
a
spreadsheet
program
for
the
next
operating
system
job
want
to
bundle
useful
content
with
the
machine
so
michael
hawley
one
of
the
engineer
developed
a
digital
dictionary
he
learn
that
a
friend
of
his
at
oxford
university
press
have
be
involve
in
the
typeset
of
a
new
edition
of
shakespeare
s
work
that
meant
that
there
be
probably
a
computer
tape
he
could
get
his
hand
on
and
if
so
incorporate
it
into
the
next
s
memory
so
i
call
up
steve
and
he
say
that
would
be
awesome
and
we
flew
over
to
oxford
together
on
a
beautiful
spring
day
in
they
met
in
the
publishing
house
s
grand
building
in
the
heart
of
oxford
where
job
make
an
offer
of
plus
cent
for
every
computer
sell
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
oxford
s
edition
of
shakespeare
it
will
be
all
gravy
to
you
he
argue
you
will
be
ahead
of
the
parade
it
s
never
be
do
before
they
agree
in
principle
and
then
go
out
to
play
skittle
over
beer
at
a
nearby
pub
where
lord
byron
use
to
drink
by
the
time
it
launch
the
next
would
also
include
a
dictionary
a
thesaurus
and
the
oxford
dictionary
of
quotation
make
it
one
of
the
pioneer
of
the
concept
of
searchable
electronic
book
instead
of
use
off
the
shelf
chip
for
the
next
job
have
his
engineer
design
custom
one
that
integrate
a
variety
of
function
on
one
chip
that
would
have
be
hard
enough
but
job
make
it
almost
impossible
by
continually
revise
the
function
he
want
it
to
do
after
a
year
it
become
clear
that
this
would
be
a
major
source
of
delay
he
also
insist
on
building
his
own
fully
automate
and
futuristic
factory
just
as
he
have
for
the
macintosh
he
have
not
be
chasten
by
that
experience
this
time
too
he
make
the
same
mistake
only
more
excessively
machine
and
robot
be
paint
and
repaint
as
he
compulsively
revise
his
color
scheme
the
wall
be
museum
white
as
they
have
be
at
the
macintosh
factory
and
there
be
black
leather
chair
and
a
custom
make
staircase
just
as
in
the
corporate
headquarters
he
insist
that
the
machinery
on
the
foot
assembly
line
be
configure
to
move
the
circuit
board
from
right
to
left
as
they
get
built
so
that
the
process
would
look
well
to
visitor
who
watch
from
the
view
gallery
empty
circuit
board
be
fed
in
at
one
end
and
twenty
minute
later
untouched
by
human
come
out
the
other
end
as
complete
board
the
process
follow
the
japanese
principle
know
as
kanban
in
which
each
machine
performs
its
task
only
when
the
next
machine
be
ready
to
receive
another
part
job
have
not
temper
his
way
of
deal
with
employee
he
apply
charm
or
public
humiliation
in
a
way
that
in
most
case
prove
to
be
pretty
effective
tribble
recall
but
sometimes
it
wasn
t
one
engineer
david
paulsen
put
in
ninety
hour
week
for
the
first
ten
month
at
next
he
quit
when
steve
walk
in
one
friday
afternoon
and
told
us
how
unimpressed
he
be
with
what
we
be
do
when
business
week
ask
him
why
he
treat
employee
so
harshly
job
say
it
make
the
company
well
part
of
my
responsibility
be
to
be
a
yardstick
of
quality
some
people
aren
t
use
to
an
environment
where
excellence
be
expect
but
he
still
have
his
spirit
and
charisma
there
be
plenty
of
field
trip
visit
by
akido
master
and
off
site
retreat
and
he
still
exude
the
pirate
flag
spunkiness
when
apple
fire
chiat

the
ad
firm
that

proclaim
congratulation
chiat

seriously
because
i
can
guarantee
you
there
be
life
after
apple
perhaps
the
great
similarity
to
his
day
at
apple
be
that
job
brought
with
him
his
reality
distortion
field
it
be
on
display
at
the
company
s
first
retreat
at
pebble
beach

pronounce
that
the
first
next
computer
would
be
ship
in
just
eighteen
month
it
be
already
clear
that
this
date
be
impossible
but
he
blew
off
a
suggestion
from
one
engineer
that
they
be
realistic
and
plan
on
shipping
in
if
we
do
that
the
world
isn

stand
still
the
technology
window
pass
us
by
and
all
the
work
we
ve
do
we
have
to
throw
down
the
toilet
he
argue
joanna
hoffman
the
veteran
of
the
macintosh
team
who
be
among
those
willing
to
challenge
job
do
so
reality
distortion
have
motivational
value
and
i
think
that
s
fine
she
say
as
job
stood
at
a
whiteboard
however
when
it
come
to
set
a
date
in
a
way
that
affect
the
design
of
the
product
then
we
get
into
real
deep
shit
job
didn
t
agree
i
think
we
have
to
drive
a
stake
in
the
ground
somewhere
and
i
think
if
we
miss
this
window
then
our
credibility
start
to
erode
what
he
do
not
say
even
though
it
be
suspect
by
all
be
that
if
their
target
slip
they
might
run
out
of
money
job
have
pledge
million
of
his
own
fund
but
at
their
current
burn
rate
that
would
run
out
in
eighteen
month
if
they
didn
t
start
get
some
revenue
from
ship
product
three
month
later
when
they
return
to
pebble
beach
for
their
next
retreat
job
begin
his
list
of
maxim
with
the
honeymoon
be
over
by
the
time
of
the
third
retreat
in
sonoma
in
september
the
timetable
be
go
and
it
look
as
though
the
company
would
hit
a
financial
wall
perot
to
the
rescue
in
late
job
sent
out
a
proposal
to
venture
capital
firm
offering
a
stake
in
next
for
million
that
put
a
valuation
on
the
entire
company
of
million
a
number
that
job
have
pull
out
of
thin
air
less
than
million
have
go
into
the
company
thus
far
and
there
be
little
to
show
for
it
other
than
a
neat
logo
and
some
snazzy
office
it
have
no
revenue
or
product
nor
any
on
the
horizon
not
surprisingly
the
venture
capitalist
all
pass
on
the
offer
to
invest
there
be
however
one
cowboy
who
be
dazzle
ross
perot
the
bantam
texan
who
have
found
electronic
data
system
then
sell
it
to
general
motor
for
billion
happen
to
watch
a
pb
documentary
the
entrepreneur
which
have
a
segment
on
job
and
next
in
november
he
instantly
identify
with
job
and
his
gang
so
much
so
that
as
he
watch
them
on
television
he
say
i
be
finish
their
sentence
for
them
it
be
a
line
eerily
similar
to
one
sculley
have
often
use
perot
call
job
the
next
day
and
offer
if
you
ever
need
an
investor
call
me
job
do
indeed
need
one
badly
but
he
be
careful
not
to
show
it
he
wait
a
week
before
call
back
perot
sent
some
of
his
analyst
to
size
up
next
but
job
take
care
to
deal
directly
with
perot
one
of
his
great
regret
in
life
perot
later
say
be
that
he
have
not
bought
microsoft
or
a
large
stake
in
it
when
a
very
young
bill
gate
have
come
to
visit
him
in
dallas
in
by
the
time
perot
call
job
microsoft
have
just
go
public
with
a
billion
valuation
perot
have
miss
out
on
the
opportunity
to
make
a
lot
of
money
and
have
a
fun
adventure
he
be
eager
not
to
make
that
mistake
again
job
make
an
offer
to
perot
that
be
three
time
more
costly
than
have
quietly
be
offer
to
venture
capitalist
a
few
month
earlier
for
million
perot
would
get
of
the
equity
in
the
company
after
job
put
in
another
million
that
meant
the
company
would
be
value
at
about
million
but
money
be
not
a
major
consideration
for
perot
after
a
meeting
with
job
he
declare
that
he
be
in
i
pick
the
jockey
and
the
jockey
pick
the
horse
and
ride
them
he
told
job
you
guy
be
the
one
i
m
bet
on
so
you
figure
it
out
perot
brought
to
next
something
that
be
almost
as
valuable
as
his
million
lifeline
he
be
a
quotable
spirit
cheerleader
for
the
company
who
could
lend
it
an
air
of
credibility
among
grown
ups
in
term
of
a
startup
company
it
s
one
that
carry
the
least
risk
of
any
i
ve
see
in
year
in
the
computer
industry
he
told
the
new
york
time
we
ve
have
some
sophisticated
people
see
the
hardware
it
blew
them
away
steve
and
his
whole
next
team
be
the
darnedest
bunch
of
perfectionist
i
ve
ever
see
perot
also
travel
in
rarefy
social
and
business
circle
that
complement
job
s
own
he
take
job
to
a
black
tie

in
san

when
the

ask
perot
whom
he
should
meet
perot
immediately
produce
job
they
be
soon
engage
in
what
perot
later
described
as
electric
conversation
with
job
animatedly
describe
the
next
wave
in
compute
at
the
end
the
king
scribble
a
note
and
hand
it
to
job
what
happen
perot
ask
job
answer
i
sell
him
a
computer
these
and
other
story
be
incorporate
into
the
mythologize
story
of
job
that
perot
told
wherever
he
go
at
a
briefing
at
the
national
press
club
in
washington
he
spun
job
s
life
story
into
a
texas
size
yarn
about
a
young
man
so
poor
he
couldn
t
afford
to
go
to
college
work
in
his
garage
at
night
play
with
computer
chip
which
be
his
hobby
and
his
dad
who
look
like
a
character
out
of
a
norman
rockwell
painting
come
in
one
day
and
say
steve
either
make
something
you
can
sell
or
go
get
a
job
sixty
day
later
in
a
wooden
box
that
his
dad
make
for
him
the
first
apple
computer
be
create
and
this
high
school
graduate
literally
change
the
world
the
one
phrase
that
be
true
be
the
one
about
paul
job
s
look
like
someone
in
a
rockwell
painting
and
perhaps
the
last
phrase
the
one
about
job
change
the
world
certainly
perot
believe
that
like
sculley
he
saw
himself
in
job
steve
s
like
me
perot
told
the
washington
post
s
david
remnick
we
re
weird
in
the
same
way
we
re
soul
mate
gate
and
next
bill
gate
be
not
a
soul
mate
job
have
convince
him
to
produce
software
application
for
the
macintosh
which
have
turn
out
to
be
hugely
profitable
for
microsoft
but
gate
be
one
person
who
be
resistant
to
job
s
reality
distortion
field
and
as
a
result
he
decide
not
to
create
software
tailor
for
the
next
platform
gate
go
to
california
to
get
periodic
demonstration
but
each
time
he
come
away
unimpressed
the
macintosh
be
truly
unique
but
i
personally
don
t
understand
what
be
so
unique
about
steve
s
new
computer
he
told
fortune
part
of
the
problem
be
that
the
rival
titan
be
congenitally
unable
to
be
deferential
to
each
other
when
gate
make
his
first
visit
to
next
s
palo
alto
headquarters
in
the
summer
of
job
kept
him
wait
for
a
half
hour
in
the
lobby
even
though
gate
could
see
through
the
glass
wall
that
job
be
walk
around
have
casual
conversation
i
d
go
down
to
next
and
i
have
the
odwalla
the
most
expensive
carrot
juice
and
i
d
never
see
tech
office
so
lavish
gate
recall
shake
his
head
with
just
a
hint
of
a
smile
and
steve
come
a
half
hour
late
to
the
meeting
job
s
sale
pitch
accord
to
gate
be
simple
we
do
the
mac
together
job
say
how
do
that
work
for
you
very
well
now
we
re
go
to
do
this
together
and
this
be
go
to
be
great
but
gate
be
brutal
to
job
just
as
job
could
be
to
others
this
machine
be
crap
he
say
the
optical
disk
have
too
low
latency
the
fuck
case
be
too
expensive
this
thing
be
ridiculous
he
decide
then
and
reaffirm
on
each
subsequent
visit
that
it
make
no
sense
for
microsoft
to
divert
resource
from
other
project
to
develop
application
for
next
bad
yet
he
repeatedly
say
so
publicly
which
make
others
less
likely
to
spend
time
develop
for
next
develop
for
it
i
ll
piss
on
it
he
told
infoworld
when
they
happen
to
meet
in
the
hallway
at
a
conference
job
start
berating
gate
for
his
refusal
to
do
software
for
next
when
you
get
a
market
i
will
consider
it
gate
reply
job

angry
it
be
a

right
in

of
everybody
recall
adele

the
xerox
parc

as
he
often
do
get
more
expressionless
as

more
heat
he
finally
just
shook
his
head
and
walk
away
beneath
their

occasional

at

microsoft
when

come
up
he
reiterate
his
belief
that
job

end
to
end
control
of
the

and
the

that

the
balance
of
power
in
the

forever
it
require

albeit
a
tiny

so
he
be
able
to
overcome
his

but
his
heart
be

philosophy
be
that
it
be
crucial
every
now
and
then
to

and
bet
the
company
on
some
new
idea
or
technology
at
the
next
launch
he
boast
of
an
example
that
as
it
turn
out

two
year

we
make
a
decision
he
say
we
saw
some
new
technology
and
we
make
a
decision
to
risk
our
company
then
he
turn
to
a
feature
that
would
prove
more
prescient
what
we
ve
do
be
make
the
first
real
digital
book
he
say
note
the
inclusion
of
the
oxford
edition
of
shakespeare
and
other
tome
there
have
not
be
an
advancement
in
the
state
of
the
art
of
print
book
technology
since
gutenberg
at
time
he
could
be
amusingly
aware
of
his
own
foible
and
he
use
the
electronic
book
demonstration
to
poke
fun
at
himself
a
word
that
s
sometimes
use
to
describe
me
be
mercurial
he
say
then
pause
the
audience
laugh
knowingly
especially
those
in
the
front
row
which
be
fill
with
next
employee
and
former
member
of
the

scroll
down
he
say
i
think
the
third
one
be
the
one
they
mean
characterize
by
unpredictable
changeableness
of
mood
there
be
a
bit
more
laughter
if
we
scroll
down
the
thesaurus
though
we
see
that
the
antonym
be
saturnine
well
what
s
that
by
simply
double
click
on
it
we
immediately
look
that
up
in
the
dictionary
and
here
it
be
cold
and
steady
in
mood
slow
to
act
or
change
of
a
gloomy
or
surly
disposition
a
little
smile
come
across
his
face
as
he
wait
for
the
ripple
of
laughter
well
he
conclude
i
don
t
think
mercurial
be
so
bad
after
all
after
the
applause
he
use
the
quotation
book
to
make
a
more
subtle
point
about
his
reality
distortion
field
the
quote
he
chose
be
from
lewis
carroll
s
through
the

queen
retort
why
sometimes
i
ve
believe
as
many
as
six
impossible
thing
before
breakfast
especially
from
the
front
row
there
be
a
roar
of
know
laughter
all
of
the
good
cheer
serve
to
sugarcoat
or
distract
attention
from
the
bad
news
when
it
come
time
to
announce
the
price
of
the
new
machine
job
do
what
he
would
often
do
in
product
demonstration
reel
off
the
feature
describe
them
as
be
worth
thousand
and
thousand
of
dollar
and
get
the
audience
to
imagine
how
expensive
it
really
should
be
then
he
announce
what
he
hop
would
seem
like
a
low
price
we
re
go
to
be
charge
high
education
a
single
price
of
from
the
faithful
there
be
scatter
applause
but
his
panel
of
academic
advisor
have
long
push
to
keep
the
price
to
between
and
and
they
thought
that
job
have
promise
to
do
so
some
of
them
be
appalled
this
be
especially
true
once
they
discover
that
the
optional
printer
would
cost
another
and
the
slowness
of
the
optical
disk
would
make
the
purchase
of
a
external
hard
disk
advisable
there
be
another
disappointment
that
he
try
to
downplay
early
next
year
we
will
have
our
release
which
be
for
software
developer
and
aggressive
end
user
there
be
a
bit
of
nervous
laughter
what
he
be
say
be
that
the
real
release
of
the
machine
and
its
software
know
as
the
release
would
not
actually
be
happen
in
early
in
fact
he
didn
t
set
a
hard
date
he
merely
suggest
it
would
be
sometime
in
the
second
quarter
of
that
year
at
the
first
next
retreat
back
in
late
he
have
refuse
to
budge
despite
joanna
hoffman
s
pushback
from
his
commitment
to
have
the
machine
finish
in
early
now
it
be
clear
it
would
be
more
than
two
year
later
the
event
end
on
a
more
upbeat
note
literally
job

onstage
people
erupt
in
jubilant
applause
the
price
and
the
delayed

contentious
divorce
and
he
need

he
told
catmull
to
find
a
buyer
as
soon
as
possible
after
a
few
potential
purchaser
balk
in
the
fall
of
catmull
and
his
colleague
alvy
ray
smith
decide
to
seek
investor
so
that
they
could
buy
the
division
themselves
so
they
call
job
arrange
another
meeting
and
drove
down
to
his
woodside
house
after
rail
for
a
while
about
the
perfidy
and
idiocy
of
sculley
job
propose
that
he
buy
their
lucasfilm
division
outright
catmull
and
smith
demur
they
want
an
investor
not
a
new
owner
but
it
soon
become
clear
that
there
be
a
middle
ground
job
could
buy
a
majority
of
the
division
and
serve
as
chairman
but
allow
catmull
and
smith
to
run
it
i
want
to
buy
it
because
i
be
really
into
computer
graphic
job
recall
i
realize
they
be
way
ahead
of
others
in
combine
art
and
technology
which
be
what
i
ve
always
be
interested
in
he
offer
to
pay
lucas
million
plus
invest
another
million
to
capitalize
the
division
as
a
stand
alone
company
that
be
far
less
than
lucas
have
be
ask
but
the
timing
be
right
they
decide
to
negotiate
a
deal
the
chief
financial
officer
at
lucasfilm
found
job
arrogant
and
prickly
so
when
it
come
time
to
hold
a
meeting
of
all
the
player
he
told
catmull
we
have
to
establish
the
right
peck
order
the
plan
be
to
gather
everyone
in
a
room
with
job
and
then
the
cfo
would
come
in
a
few
minute
late
to
establish
that
he
be
the
person
run
the
meeting
but
a
funny
thing
happen
catmull
recall
steve
start
the
meeting
on
time
without
the
cfo
and
by
the
time
the
cfo
walk
in
steve
be
already
in
control
of
the
meeting
job
met
only
once
with
george
lucas
who
warn
him
that
the
people
in
the
division
care
more
about
make
animate
movie
than
they
do
about
make
computer
you
know
these
guy
be
hell
bent
on
animation
lucas
told
him
lucas
later
recall
i
do
warn
him
that
be
basically
ed
and
john
s
agenda
i
think
in
his
heart
he
bought
the
company
because
that
be
his
agenda
too
the
final
agreement
be

a
while
job
let
catmull
and
smith
run
pixar
without
much
interference
every
month
or
so
they
would
gather
for
a
board
meeting
usually
at
next
headquarters
where
job
would
focus
on
the
finance
and
strategy
nevertheless
by
dint
of
his
personality
and
control
instinct
job
be
soon
play
a
strong
role
he
spew
out
a
stream
of
idea
some
reasonable
others
wacky
about
what
pixar
s
hardware
and
software
could
become
and
on
his
occasional
visit
to
the

job
want
to
sell
pixar

to
a

so
he
have
the
pixar
folk
open
up
sale
office
for
which
he
approve
the
design
in
major
city
on
the
theory
that
creative
people
would
soon
come
up
with
all
sort
of
way
to
use
the
machine
my
view
be
that
people
be
creative
animal
and
will
figure
out
clever
new
way
to
use
tool
that
the
inventor
never
imagine
he
later
say
i
thought
that
would
happen
with
the
pixar
computer
just
as
it
do
with
the
mac
but
the
machine
never
take
hold
with
regular
consumer
it
cost
too
much
and
there
be
not
many
software
program
for
it
on
the
software
side
pixar
have
a
render
program
know
as
reyes
render
everything
you
ever
saw
for
make
d
graphic
and
image
after
job
become
chairman
the
company
create
a
new
language
and
interface
name
renderman
that
it
hop
would
become
a
standard
for
d
graphic
render
just
as
adobe
s
postscript
be
for
laser
printing
as
he
have
with
the
hardware
job
decide
that
they
should
try
to
find
a
mass
market
rather
than
just
a
specialized
one
for
the
software
they
make
he
be
never
content
to
aim
only
at
the
corporate
or
high
end
specialized
market
he
would
have
these
great
vision
of
how
renderman
could
be
for
everyman
recall
pam
kerwin
pixar
s
marketing
director
he
kept
come
up
with
idea
about
how
ordinary
people
would
use
it
to
make
amaze
d
graphic
and
photorealistic
image
the
pixar
team
would
try
to
dissuade
him
by
say
that
renderman
be
not
as
easy
to
use
as
say
excel
or
adobe
illustrator
then
job
would
go
to
a
whiteboard
and
show
them
how
to
make
it
simpler
and
more
user
friendly
we
would
be
nod
our
head
and
get
excite
and
say
yes
yes
this
will
be
great
kerwin
recall
and
then
he
would
leave
and
we
would
consider
it
for
a
moment
and
then
say
what
the
heck
be
he
think
he
be
so
weirdly
charismatic
that
you
almost
have
to
get
deprogrammed
after
you
talk
to
him
as
it
turn

at
disney
studio
except
it
didn
t
work
out
some
of
us
young
guy
want
to
bring
star
war
level
quality
to
the
art
of
animation
but
we
be
held
in
check
lasseter
recall
i
get
disillusion
then
i
get
caught
in
a
feud
between
two
boss
and
the
head
animation
guy
fire
me
so
in
ed
catmull
and
alvy
ray
smith
be
able
to
recruit
him
to
work
where
star
war
level
quality
be
be
define
lucasfilm
it
be
not
certain
that
george
lucas
already
worried
about
the
cost
of
his
computer
division
would
really
approve
of
hire
a
full
time
animator
so
lasseter
be
give
the
title
interface
designer
after
job
come
onto
the
scene
he
and
lasseter
begin
to
share
their
passion
for
graphic
design
i
be
the
only
guy
at
pixar
who
be
an
artist
so
i
bond
with
steve
over
his
design
sense
lasseter
say
he
be
a
gregarious
playful
and
huggable
man
who
wore
flowery
hawaiian
shirt
kept
his
office
clutter
with
vintage
toy
and
love
cheeseburger
job
be
a
prickly
whip
thin
vegetarian
who
favor
austere
and
uncluttered
surroundings
but
they
be
actually
well
suit
for
each
other
lasseter
be
an
artist
so
job
treat
him
deferentially
and
lasseter
view
job
correctly
as
a
patron
who
could
appreciate
artistry
and
knew
how
it
could
be
interwoven
with
technology
and
commerce
job
and
catmull
decide
that
in
order
to
show
off
their
hardware
and
software
lasseter
should
produce
another
short
animate
film
in
for
siggraph
the
annual
computer
graphic
conference
at
the
time
lasseter
be
use
the
luxo
lamp
on
his
desk
as
a
model
for
graphic
render
and
he
decide
to
turn
luxo
into
a
lifelike
character
a
friend
s
young
child
inspire
him
to
add
luxo
jr
and
he
show
a
few
test
frame
to
another
animator
who
urge
him
to
make
sure
he
told
a
story
lasseter
say
he
be
make
only
a
short
but
the
animator
remind
him
that
a
story
can
be
told
even
in
a
few
second
lasseter
take
the
lesson
to
heart
luxo
jr
end
up
be
just
over
two
minute
it
told
the
tale
of
a
parent
lamp
and
a
child
lamp
push
a
ball
back
and
forth
until
the
ball
burst
to
the
child
s
dismay
job
be
so
excite
that
he
take
time
off
from
the
pressure
at
next
to
fly
down
with
lasseter
to
siggraph
which
be
be
held
in
dallas
that
august
it
be
so
hot
and
muggy
that
when
we
d
walk
outside
the
air
hit
us
like
a
tennis
racket
lasseter
recall
there
be
ten
thousand
people
at
the
trade
show
and
job
love
it
artistic
creativity
energize
him
especially
when
it
be
connect
to
technology
there
be
a
long
line
to
get
into
the
auditorium
where
the
film
be
be
screen
so
job
not
one
to
wait
his
turn
fast
talk
their
way
in
first
luxo
jr
get
a
prolong
stand
ovation
and
be

best
film
oh

at
the
end
i
really
get
this
i
get
what
it
s
all
about
as
he
later
explain
our
film
be
the
only
one
that
have
art
to
it
not
just
good
technology
pixar
be
about
make
that
combination
just
as
the
macintosh
have
be
luxo
jr
be
nominate
for
an
academy
award
and
job
flew
down
to
los
angeles
to
be
there
for
the
ceremony
it
didn
t
win
but
job
become
commit
to
make
new
animate
short
each
year
even
though
there
be
not
much
of
a
business
rationale
for
do
so
as
time
get
tough
at
pixar
he
would
sit
through
brutal
budget
cut
meeting
show
no
mercy
then
lasseter
would
ask
that
the
money
they
have
just
save
be
use
for
his
next
film
and
job
would
agree
tin
toy
not
all
of
job
s
relationship
at
pixar
be
as
good
his
bad
clash
come
with
catmull
s
cofounder
alvy
ray
smith
from
a
baptist
background
in
rural
north
texas
smith
become
a
free
spirit
hippie
computer
image
engineer
with
a
big
build
big
laugh
and
big
personality
and
occasionally
an
ego
to
match
alvy
just
glow
with
a
high
color
friendly
laugh
and
a
whole
bunch
of
groupie
at
conference
say
pam
kerwin
a
personality
like
alvy
s
be
likely
to
ruffle
steve
they
be
both
visionary
and
high
energy
and
high
ego
alvy
be
not
as
willing
to
make
peace
and
overlook
thing
as
ed
be
smith
saw
job
as
someone
whose
charisma
and
ego
lead
him
to
abuse
power
he
be
like
a
televangelist
smith
say
he
want
to
control
people
but
i
would
not
be
a
slave
to
him
which
be
why
we
clashed
ed
be
much
more
able
to
go
with
the
flow
job
would
sometimes
assert
his
dominance
at
a
meeting
by
say
something
outrageous
or
untrue
smith
take
great
joy
in
call
him
on
it
and
he
would
do
so
with
a
large
laugh
and
a
smirk
this
do
not
endear
him
to
job
one
day
at
a
board
meeting
job
start
berating
smith
and
other
top
pixar
executive
for
the
delay
in
get
the
circuit
board
complete
for
the
new
version
of
the
pixar
image
computer
at
the
time
next
be
also
very
late
in
complete
its
own
computer
board
and
smith
point
that
out
hey
you
re
even
later
with
your
next
board
so
quit
jumping
on
us
job
go
ballistic
or
in
smith
s
phrase
totally
nonlinear
when
smith
be
feel
attack
or
confrontational
he
tend
to
lapse
into
his
southwestern
accent
job
start
parody
it
in
his
sarcastic
style
it
be
a
bully
tactic
and
i
explode
with
everything
i
have
smith
recall
before
i
knew
it
we
be
in
each
other
s
face
about
three
inch
apart
scream
at
each
other
job
be
very
possessive
about
control
of
the
whiteboard
during
a
meeting
so
the
burly
smith
push
past
him
and
start
write
on
it
you
can
t
do
that
job
shout
what
respond
smith
i
can
t
write
on
your
whiteboard
bullshit
at
that
point
job
storm
out
smith
eventually
resign
to
form
a
new
company
to
make
software
for
digital
draw
and
image
edit
job
refuse
him
permission
to
use
some
code

far
inflame
their
enmity
alvy
eventually
get
what

need
say
catmull
but
he
be
very
stress
for
a
year
and
developed
a
lung
infection
in
the
end
it
work
out
well
enough
microsoft
eventually
bought
smith
s
company
give
him
the
distinction
of
be
a
founder
of
one
company
that
be

thanks
for
the
clearer
perspective
pixar
be
able
to
create
some
powerful
software
product
aim
at
average
consumer
or
at
least
those
average
consumer
who
share
job
s
passion
for
design
thing
job
still
hop
that
the
ability
to
make
super
realistic
d
image
at
home
would
become
part
of
the
desktop
publishing
craze
pixar
s
showplace
for
example
allow
user
to
change
the
shading
on
the
d
object
they
create
so
that
they
could
display
them
from
various
angle
with
appropriate
shadow
job
thought
it
be
incredibly
compelling
but
most
consumer
be
content
to
live
without
it
it
be
a
case
where
his
passion
mislead
him
the
software
have
so
many
amaze
feature
that
it
lack
the
simplicity
job
usually

pixar
couldn
t
compete
with
adobe
which
be
make
software
that
be
less
sophisticated
but
far
less
complicate
and
expensive

a
great
movie
the
new
team
at
disney
michael
eisner
the
ceo
and
jeffrey
katzenberg
in
the
film
division
begin
a
quest
to
get
lasseter
to
come
back
they
like
tin
toy
and
they
thought
that
something
more
could
be
do
with
animate
story
of
toy
that
come
alive
and
have
human
emotion
but
lasseter
grateful
for
job
s
faith
in
him
felt
that
pixar
be
the
only
place
where
he
could
create
a
new
world
of
computer
generate
animation
he
told
catmull
i
can
go
to
disney
and
be
a
director
or
i
can
stay
here
and
make
history
so
disney
begin
talk
about
make
a
production
deal
with
pixar
lasseter
s
short
be
really
breathtaking
both
in
storytelling
and
in
the
use
of
technology
recall
katzenberg
i
try
so
hard
to
get
him
to
disney
but
he
be
loyal
to
steve
and
pixar
so
if
you
can
t
beat
them
join
them
we
decide
to
look
for
way
we
could
join
up
with
pixar
and
have
them
make
a
film
about
toy
for
us
by
this
point
job
have
pour
close
to
million
of
his
own
money
into
pixar
more
than
half
of
what
he
have
pocket
when
he
cashed
out
of
apple
and
he
be
still
lose
money
at
next
he
be
hard
nose
about
it
he
force
all
pixar
employee
to
give
up
their
option
as
part
of
his
agreement
to
add
another
round
of
personal
funding
in
but
he
be
also
a
romantic
in
his
love
for
what
artistry
and
technology
could
do
together
his
belief
that
ordinary
consumer
would
love
to
do
d
model
on
pixar
software
turn
out
to
be
wrong
but
that
be
soon
replace
by
an
instinct
that
turn
out
to
be
right
that
combine
great
art
and
digital
technology
would
transform
animate
film
more
than
anything
have
since
when
walt
disney
have
give
life
to
snow
white
look
back
job
say
that
have
he
know
more
he
would
have
focus
on
animation
sooner
and
not
worried
about
push
the
company
s
hardware
or
software
application
on
the
other
hand
have
he
know
the
hardware
and
software
would
never
be
profitable
he
would
not
have
take
over
pixar
life
kind
of
snooker
me
into
do
that
and
perhaps
it
be
for
the
well

i
realize
the
answer

blown
away
to
be
in
the
presence
of

apple
ii
and

she
recall

be
a
sudden
multimillionaire
she
be
a
world
famous
celebrity
but
sweetly
down
to
earth
and
not
all
that
wealthy
she
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
him
then
and
still
found
him
puzzle
when

about
him
almost
thirty
year
later
at
one
dinner
early
in
their
relationship

talk
about
ralph
lauren

shop
which
she
admit
she
have
never

s
a
beautiful
red
dress
there
that
would
be
perfect
for
you
he
say
and
then
drove
her
to
the
store
in
the
stanford
mall
baez
recall
i
say
to
myself
far
out
terrific
i
m
with
one
of
the
world
s
richest
men
and
he
want
me
to
have
this
beautiful
dress
when
they
get
to
the
store
job
bought
a
handful
of
shirt
for
himself
and
show

the
red
dress
you
ought
to
buy

a
little
surprised
and
told
him
she
couldn
t
really
afford
it
he
say
nothing
and
they
left
wouldn
t
you
think
if
someone
have
talk
like
that
the
whole
even
that
they
be
go
to
get
it
for
you
she
ask
me
seem
genuinely
puzzle
about
the
incident
the
mystery
of
the
red
dress
be
in
your
hand
i
felt
a
bit
strange
about
it
he
would
give
her
computer
but
not
a
dress
and
when
he
brought
her
flower
he
make
sure
to
say
they
be
left
over
from
an
event
in
the
office
he
be
both
romantic
and
afraid
to
be
romantic
she
say
when
he
be
work
on
the
next
computer
he
go
to
baez
s
house
in
woodside
to
show
her
how
well
it
could
produce
music
he
have
it
play
a
brahms
quartet
and
he
told
me
eventually
computer
would
sound
well
than
human
play
it
even
get
the
innuendo
and
the
cadence
well
baez
recall
she
be
revolt
by
the
idea
he
be
work
himself
up
into
a
fervor
of
delight
while
i
be
shrink
into
a
rage
and
think
how
could
you
defile
music
like
that
job
would
confide
in
debi
coleman
and
joanna
hoffman
about
his
relationship
with
baez
and
worry
about
whether
he
could
marry
someone
who
have
a
teenage
son
and
be
probably
past
the
point
of
want
to
have
more
child
at
time
he
would
belittle
her
as
be
an
issue
singer
and
not
a
true
political
singer
like
dylan
say
hoffman
she
be
a
strong
woman
and
he
want
to
show
he
be
in
control
plus
he
always
say
he
want
to
have
a
family
and
with
her
he
knew
that
he
wouldn
t
and

after
about
three
year

end
their
romance
and
drift
into
become
just
friend
i
thought
i

in
love
with
her

lot
he

t
destine
to

more

her
memoir

about
her
breakup
with
her

why
she
never

deep
affection
for

edgy
novel
about
him

regular
guy
that
described
his
quirk
with
discomforting
accuracy
one

a
life
philosophy

relaxed
and
content
over

little
chair
with
the
meat
and
me
but
it
be
not
always
sweetness
and
light
job
be
as
mercurial
with
lisa
as
he
be
with
almost
everyone
cycling
between
embrace
and
abandonment
on
one
visit
he
would
be
playful
on
the
next
he
would
be
cold

to
be
temperamental
in

would
be
a
roller

with
each
of
the

by
their

stubbornness
after

their
separate
way

retain
their
spiritual
connection

at
the
green
water
roll
on
below
your
world
have
cleave
and
then
it
pause
wait
to
rearrange
itself
around
whatever
you
chose
next
i
want
to
run
away
from

come
before

try
to
convince
you
to
begin
a
new
life
with
me
in
paris
to
shed
our
former
self
and
let
something
else
course
through
us
i
want
us
to
crawl
through
that
black
chasm
of
your
broken
world
and
emerge
anonymous
and
new
in
simple
life
where
i
could
cook
you
simple
dinner
and
we
could
be
together
every
day
like
child
play
a
sweet
game
with
no
purpose
save
the
game
itself

like
to
think
you
consider
it
before
you
laugh
and
say
what
could
i
do
i
ve
make
myself
unemployable

our
bold
future

a
hip
young
couple
who
have
once
work
at
chez
panisse
as
housekeeper
and
vegetarian
cook
and
they
make
her
feel
like
an
interloper
she
would
occasionally
move
out
to
an
apartment
of
her
own
in
palo
alto
especially
after
one
of
her
torrential
argument
with
job
neglect
be
a
form
of
abuse
she
once
scrawl
on
the
wall
of
the
hallway
to
their
bedroom
she
be
entrance
by
him
but
she
be
also
baffle
by
how
uncaring
he
could
be
she
would
later
recall
how
incredibly
painful
it
be
to
be
in
love
with
someone
so
self
center
care
deeply
about
someone
who
seem
incapable
of
care
be
a
particular
kind
of
hell
that
she
wouldn
t
wish
on
anyone
she
say
they
be
different
in
so
many
way
on
the
spectrum
of
cruel
to
kind
they
be
close
to
the
opposite
pole
hertzfeld
later
say
redse
s
kindness
be
manifest
in
way
large
and
small
she
always
give
money
to
street
people
she
volunteer
to
help
those
who
like
her
father
be
afflict
with
mental
illness
and
she
take
care
to
make
lisa
and
even
chrisann
feel
comfortable
with
her
more
than
anyone
she
help
persuade
job
to
spend
more
time
with
lisa
but
she
lack
job
s
ambition
and
drive
the
ethereal
quality
that
make
her
seem
so
spiritual
to
job
also
make
it
hard
for
them
to
stay
on
the
same
wavelength
their
relationship
be
incredibly
tempestuous
say
hertzfeld
because
of
both
of
their
character
they
would
have
lot
and
lot
of
fight
they
also
have
a
basic
philosophical
difference
about
whether
aesthetic
taste
be
fundamentally
individual
as
redse
believe
or
universal
and
could
be
taught
as
job
believe
she
accuse
him
of
be
too
influence
by
the
bauhaus
movement
steve
believe
it
be
our
job
to
teach
people
aesthetic
to
teach
people
what
they
should
like
she
recall
i
don
t
share
that
perspective
i
believe
when
we
listen
deeply
both
within
ourselves
and
to
each
other
we
be
able
to
allow
what
s
innate
and
true
to
emerge
when
they
be
together
for
a
long
stretch
thing
do
not
work
out
well
but
when
they
be
apart
job
would
pine
for
her
finally
in
the
summer
of
he
ask
her
to
marry
him
she
couldn
t
do
it
it
would
drive
her
crazy
she
told
friend
she
have
grown
up
in
a
volatile
household
and
her
relationship
with
job
bore
too
many
similarity
to
that
environment
they
be
opposite
who
attract
she
say
but
the
combination
be
too
combustible
i
could
not
have
be
a
good
wife
to
steve
job
the
icon
she
later
explain
i
would
have
suck
at
it
on
many
level
in
our
personal
interaction
i
couldn
t
abide
his
unkindness
i
didn
t
want
to
hurt
him
yet
i
didn
t
want
to
stand
by
and
watch
him
hurt
other
people
either
it
be
painful
and

after
they
broke
up
redse

found

a
mental
health
resource
network
in
california
she
happen
to
read
in
a
psychiatric
manual
about
narcissistic
personality
disorder
and
decide
that
job
perfectly
met
the
criterion
it
fit
so
well
and
explain
so
much
of
what
we
have
struggle
with
that
i
realize
expect
him
to
be
nicer
or
less
self
center
be
like
expect
a
blind
man
to
see
she
say
it
also
explain
some
of
the
choice
he
d
make
about
his
daughter
lisa
at
that
time
i
think
the
issue
be
empathy
the
capacity
for
empathy
be
lack
redse
later
married

two

when
he
begin
his
battle
with
cancer
she
get
in
touch
again
to

support
she
become
very
emotional
whenever
she
recall
their
relationship

our
value
clashed
and

it

about

about

laurene
powell
by
this
point
base
on
his
date
history
a
matchmaker
could
have
put

of
the

he

tale
we
have
know
about
steve
and
he
be
a
person
of
interest
to
us
because
we
be
business
student
she
recall
andy
hertzfeld

nice
but
she
can
be

begin
hertzfeld
say
her
college
roommate
told
me
that
laurene

him
if
it
s
true
that
steve
be
manipulate
there
be
a
fair
amount
of
irony
there
but
powell
later
insist
that
this
wasn
t
the
case
she
go
only
because
her
friend
want

go
and
she
be
slightly
confuse
as
to

go
to
see
i
knew
that
steve

a
way
of
focus
on
something
with
insane
intensity
for
a
while
and
then
abruptly
turn
away
his
gaze
at
work
he
would
focus
on
what
he
want
to
when
he
want
to
and
on
other
matter
he
would
be
unresponsive
no

hard
people
try
to
get
him
to
engage
in
his
personal
life
he
be
the

way
at
time
he
and
powell
would
indulge
in
public
display
of
affection
that
be
so
intense
they
embarrass
everyone
in
their
presence
include
kat
smith

powell
s
mother
in
the
morning
at

up
by
blasting
the
fine
young
cannibal
she
drive
me
crazy
on
his
tape
deck
yet
at
other
time
he
would
ignore
her
steve
would
fluctuate
between
intense
focus
where
she
be
the
center
of
the
universe
to
be
coldly
distant
and
focus
on
work
say
smith
he
have
the
power
to
focus
like
a
laser
beam
and
when
it
come
across
you
you
bask
in
the
light
of
his
attention
when
it
move

another
point
of
focus
it
be
very
very
dark

proposal
on
the
first
day
of

the
type
of
person
he
be
in
september
she
become
fed
up
with
wait
and
move

his
favorite
vacation
spot
kona
village
in

he
have
start
go
there
nine
year
earlier
when
stress
out
at
apple
he
have
ask
his
assistant
to
pick
out
a
place
for
him
to
escape
at
first
glance
he
didn
t
like
the
cluster
of
sparse
thatch
roof
bungalow
nestle
on
a
beach
on
the
big
island
of
hawaii
it
be
a
family
resort
with
communal
eat
but
within
hour
he
have
begin
to
view
it
as
paradise
there
be
a
simplicity
and
spare
beauty
that
move
him
and
he
return
whenever
he
could
he
especially
enjoy
be
there
that
december
with
powell
their
love
have
mature
the
night
before
christmas
he
again
declare
even
more
formally
that
he
want
to
marry
her
soon
another
factor
would
drive
that
decision
while
in
hawaii
powell
get
pregnant
we
know
exactly
where
it
happen
job
later
say
with
a
laugh
the
wedding
march
powell
s
pregnancy
do
not
completely
settle
the
issue
job
again
begin
balking
at
the
idea
of
marriage
even
though
he
have
dramatically
propose
to
her
both
at
the
very
begin
and
the
very
end
of
furious
she
move
out
of
his
house
and
back
to
her
apartment
for
a
while
he
sulk
or
ignore
the
situation
then
he
thought
he
might
still
be
in
love
with
tina
redse
he
sent
her
rose
and
try
to
convince
her
to
return
to
him
maybe
even
get
married
he
be
not
sure
what
he
want
and
he
surprised
a
wide
swath
of
friend
and
even
acquaintance
by
ask
them
what
he
should
do
who
be
prettier
he
would
ask
tina
or
laurene
who
do
they
like
well
who
should
he
marry
in
a
chapter
about
this
in
mona
simpson
s
novel
a
regular
guy
the
job
character
ask
more
than
a
hundred
people
who
they
thought
be
more
beautiful
but
that
be
fiction
in
reality
it
be
probably
few
than
a
hundred
he
end
up
make
the
right
choice
as
redse
told
friend
she
never
would
have
survive
if
she
have
go
back
to
job
nor
would
their
marriage
even
though
he
would
pine
about
the
spiritual
nature
of
his
connection
to
redse
he
have
a
far
more
solid
relationship
with
powell
he
like
her
he
love
her
he
respect
her
and
he
be
comfortable
with
her
he
may
not
have
see
her
as
mystical
but
she
be
a
sensible
anchor
for
his
life
he
be
the
lucky
guy
to
have
land
with
laurene
who
be
smart
and
can
engage
him
intellectually
and
can
sustain
his
ups
and
down
and
tempestuous
personality
say
joanna
hoffman
because
she
s
not
neurotic
steve
may
feel
that
she
be
not
as
mystical
as
tina
or
something
but
that
s
silly
andy
hertzfeld
agree
laurene
look
a
lot
like
tina
but
she
be
totally
different
because
she
be
tougher
and
armor
plat
that
s
why
the
marriage
work
job
understood
this
as
well
despite
his
emotional
turbulence
and
occasional
meanness
the
marriage
would
turn
out
to
be
endure
marked
by
loyalty
and

but
then
she
write
me
a
long
email
that
she
say
would
help
explain
the
situation
do
you

how
steve

the
city
of
woodside
to
allow
him
to
tear
his
woodside
home
down
there
be
a
community
of
people
who
want
to
preserve
his
woodside
house
due
to
its
historical
value
but
steve
want
to
tear

a
home
with
an
orchard
steve
let
that
house
fall
into
so
much
disrepair
and
decay
over
a
number
of
year
that
there
be
no
way
to
save
it
the
strategy
he
use
to
get
what
he
want
be
to
simply
follow
the
line
of
least
involvement
and
resistance
so
by
his
do
nothing
on
the
house
and
maybe
even
leave
the
window
open
for
year

more
destructive
to
me
and
more
problematic
for

it
may
not
have
be
of
the
great
integrity

lisa
again
to
not
speak
to
him
for
a
few
year
and
thus
the
pattern
would
continue
mona

use
all
of
this
plus
her
imagination
as
a
springboard
for
her
third
novel
a
regular
guy
publish
in
the
book
s
title
character
be
base
on
job
and
to
some
extent
it
adheres
to
reality
it
depicts
job
s
quiet
generosity
to
and
purchase
of
a
special
car
for
a
brilliant
friend
who
have
degenerative
bone
disease
and
it
accurately
describes
many
unflattering
aspect
of
his
relationship
with
lisa
include
his
original
denial
of
paternity
but
other
part
be
purely
fiction
chrisann
have
taught
lisa
at
a
very
early
age
how
to
drive
for
example
but
the
book
s
scene
of
jane
drive
a
truck
across
the
mountain
alone
at
age
five
to
find
her
father
of
course
never
happen
in
addition
there
be
little
detail
in
the
novel
that
in
journalist
parlance
be
too
good
to
check
such
as
the
head
snap
description
of
the
character
base
on
job
in
the
very
first
sentence
he
be
a
man
too
busy
to
flush
toilet
on
the
surface
the
novel
s
fictional
portrayal
of
job
seem
harsh
simpson
describes
her
main
character
as
unable
to
see
any
need
to
pander
to
the
wish
or
whim
of
other
people
his
hygiene
be
also
as
dubious
as
that
of
the
real
job
he
didn
t
believe
in
deodorant
and
often
profess
that
with
a
proper
diet
and
the
peppermint
castile
soap
you
would
neither
perspire
nor
smell
but
the
novel
be
lyrical
and
intricate
on
many
level
and
by
the
end
there
be
a
fuller
picture
of
a
man
who
loses
control
of
the
great
company
he
have
found
and
learns
to
appreciate
the
daughter
he
have
abandon
the
final
scene
be
of
him
dance
with
his
daughter
job
later
say
that
he
never
read
the
novel
i
heard
it
be
about
me
he
told
me
and
if
it
be
about
me
i
would
have
gotten
really
piss
off
and
i
didn
t
want
to

and
saw
the
reflection
of
himself
in
the
main
character
about
of
it
be
totally
me
right
down
to
the
mannerism
he
told
the
reporter
steve
lohr
and
i
m
certainly
not
tell
you
which
his

make
of

piece
for
the
harvard

a
lot
alike
he

katzenberg
be
delightfully
aware
of
this
everybody
think
i
m
a
tyrant
he
told
the
pixar
team
i
be
a
tyrant
but
i
m
usually
right
one
can
imagine
job
say
the
same
as
befit
two
men
of
equal
passion
the
negotiation
between
katzenberg
and
job
take
month
katzenberg
insist
that
disney
be
give
the
right
to
pixar
s
proprietary
technology
for
make
d
animation
job
refuse
and
he
end
up
win
that
engagement
job
have
his
own
demand
pixar
would
have
part
ownership
of
the
film
and
its
character
share
control
of
both
video
right
and
sequel
if
that
s
what
you
want
katzenberg
say
we
can
just
quit
talk
and
you
can
leave
now
job
stayed
concede
that
point
lasseter
be
rivet
as
he
watch
the
two
wiry
and
tightly
wound
principal
parry
and
thrust
just
to
see
steve
and
jeffrey
go
at
it
i
be
in
awe
he
recall
it
be
like
a
fence
match
they
be
both
master
but
katzenberg
go
into
the
match
with
a
saber
job
with
a
mere
foil
pixar
be
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
and
need
a
deal
with
disney
far
more
than
disney
need
a
deal
with
pixar
plus
disney
could
afford
to
finance
the
whole
enterprise
and
pixar
couldn
t
the
result
be
a
deal
struck
in
may
by
which
disney
would
own
the
picture
and
its
character
outright
have
creative
control
and
pay
pixar
about
of
the
ticket
revenue
it
have
the
option
but
not
the
obligation
to
do
pixar
s
next
two
film
and
the
right
to
make
with
or
without
pixar
sequel
use
the
character
in
the
film
disney
could
also
kill
the
film
at
any
time
with
only
a
small
penalty
the
idea
that
john
lasseter
pitch
be
call
toy
story
it
sprang
from
a
belief
which
he
and
job
share
that
product
have
an
essence
to
them
a
purpose
for
which
they
be
make
if
the
object
be
to
have
feeling
these
would
be
base
on
its
desire
to
fulfill
its
essence
the
purpose
of
a
glass
for
example
be
to
hold
water
if
it
have
feeling
it
would
be
happy
when
full
and
sad
when
empty
the
essence
of
a
computer
screen
be
to
interface
with
a
human
the
essence
of
a
unicycle
be
to
be
ridden
in
a
circus
as
for
toy
their
purpose
be
to
be
played
with
by
kid
and
thus
their
existential
fear
be
of
be
discard
or
upstaged
by
newer
toy
so
a
buddy
movie
pair
an
old
favorite
toy
with
a
shiny
new
one
would
have
an
essential
drama
to
it
especially
when
the
action
revolve
around
the
toy
be
separate
from
their
kid
the
original
treatment
begin
everyone
have
have
the
traumatic
childhood
experience
of
lose
a
toy
our
story
take
the
toy
s
point
of
view
as
he
loses
and
try
to
regain
the
single
thing
most
important
to
him
to
be
played
with
by
child
this
be
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
all
toy
it
be
the
emotional
foundation
of
their
existence
the
two
main
character
go
through
many
iteration
before
they
end
up
as
buzz
lightyear
and
woody
every
couple
of
week
lasseter
and
his
team
would
put
together
their
late
set
of
storyboards
or
footage
to
show
the
folk
at
disney
in
early
screen
test
pixar
show
off
its
amaze
technology
by
for
example
produce
a
scene
of
woody
rustle
around
on
top
of
a
dresser
while
the
light
ripple
in
through
a
venetian
blind
cast
shadow
on
his
plaid
shirt
an
effect
that
would
have
be
almost
impossible
to
render
by
hand
impress
disney
with
the
plot
however
be
more
difficult
at
each
presentation
by
pixar
katzenberg
would
tear
much
of
it
up
barking
out
his
detailed
comment
and
note
and
a
cadre
of
clipboard
carry
flunky
be
on
hand
to
make
sure
every
suggestion
and
whim
uttered
by
katzenberg
receive
follow
up
treatment
katzenberg
s
big
push
be
to
add
more
edginess
to
the
two
main
character
it
may
be
an
animate
movie
call
toy
story
he
say
but
it
should
not
be
aim
only
at
child
at
first
there
be
no
drama
no
real
story
and
no
conflict
katzenberg
recall
he
suggest
that
lasseter
watch
some
classic
buddy
movie
such
as
the
defiant
one
and
hour
in
which
two
character
with
different
attitude
be
thrown
together
and
have
to
bond
in
addition
he
kept
push
for
what
he
call
edge
and
that
meant
make
woody
s
character
more
jealous
mean
and
belligerent
toward
buzz
the
new
interloper
in
the
toy
box
it
s
a
toy
eat
toy
world
woody
say
at
one
point
after
push
buzz
out
of
a
window
after
many
round
of
note
from
katzenberg
and
other
disney
exec
woody
have
be
strip
of
almost
all
charm
in
one
scene
he
throw
the
other
toy
off
the
bed
and
order
slinky
to
come
help
when
slinky
hesitates
woody
bark
who
say
your
job
be
to
think
spring
wiener
slinky
then
asks
a
question
that
the
pixar
team
member
would
soon
be
ask
themselves
why
be
the
cowboy
so
scary
as
tom
hank
who
have
sign
up
to
be
woody
s
voice
exclaim
at
one
point
this
guy
s
a
real
jerk
cut
lasseter
and
his
pixar
team
have
the
first
half
of
the
movie
ready
to
screen
by
november
so
they
brought
it
down
to
burbank
to
show
to
katzenberg
and
other
disney
executive
peter
schneider
the
head
of
feature
animation
have
never
be
enamor
of
katzenberg
s
idea
of
have
outsider
make
animation
for
disney
and
he
declare
it
a
mess
and
order
that
production
be
stop
katzenberg
agree
why
be
this
so
terrible
he
ask
a
colleague
tom
schumacher
because
it
s
not
their
movie
anymore
schumacher
bluntly
reply
he
later
explain
they
be
follow
katzenberg
s
note
and
the
project
have
be
driven
completely
off
track
lasseter
realize
that
schumacher
be
right
i
sat
there
and
i
be
pretty
much
embarrass
with
what
be
on
the
screen
he
recall
it
be
a
story
fill
with
the
most
unhappy
mean
character
that
i
ve
ever
see
he
ask
disney
for
the
chance
to
retreat
back
to
pixar
and
rework
the
script
katzenberg
be
supportive
job
do
not
insert
himself
much
into
the
creative
process
give
his
proclivity
to
be
in
control
especially
on
matter
of
taste
and
design
this
self
restraint
be
a
testament
to
his
respect
for
lasseter
and
the
other
artist
at
pixar
as
well
as
for
the
ability
of
lasseter
and
catmull
to
keep
him
at
bay
he
do
however
help
manage
the
relationship
with
disney
and
the
pixar
team
appreciate
that
when
katzenberg
and
schneider
halt
production
on
toy
story
job
kept
the
work
go
with
his
own
personal
funding
and
he
take
their
side
against
katzenberg
he
have
toy
story
all
mess
up
job
later
say
he
want
woody
to
be
a
bad
guy
and
when
he
shut
us
down
we
kind
of
kick
him
out
and
say
this
isn
t
what
we
want
and
do
it
the
way
we
always
want
the
pixar
team
come
back
with
a
new
script
three
month
later
the
character
of
woody
morph
from
be
a
tyrannical
bos
of
andy
s
other
toy
to
be
their
wise
leader
his
jealousy
after
the
arrival
of
buzz
lightyear
be
portrayed
more
sympathetically
and
it
be
set
to
the
strain
of
a
randy
newman
song
strange
thing
the
scene
in
which
woody
push
buzz
out
of
the
window
be
rewrite
to
make
buzz
s
fall
the
result
of
an
accident

by
a
little
trick
woody
initiate

the
new
approach
and
by
february
the
film
be
back
in
production
katzenberg
have
be
impressed
with
job
s
focus
on
keep
cost
under
control
even
in
the
early
budgeting
process
steve
be
very
eager
to
do
it
as
efficiently
as
possible
he
say
but
the
million
production
budget
be
prove
inadequate
especially
give
the
major
revision
that
be
necessary
after
katzenberg
have
push
them
to
make
woody
too
edgy
so
job
demand
more
in
order
to
complete
the
film
right
listen
we
make
a
deal
katzenberg
told
him
we
give
you
business
control
and
you
agree
to
do
it
for
the
amount
we
offer
job
be
furious
he
would
call
katzenberg
by
phone
or
fly
down
to
visit
him
and
be
in
katzenberg
s
word
as
wildly
relentless
as
only
steve
can
be
job
insist
that
disney
be
liable
for
the
cost
overrun
because
katzenberg
have
so
badly
mangle
the
original
concept
that
it
require
extra
work
to
restore
thing
wait
a
minute
katzenberg
shot
back
we
be
help
you
you
get
the
benefit
of
our
creative
help
and
now
you
want
us
to
pay
you
for
that
it
be
a
case
of
two
control
freak
argue
about
who
be
do
the
other
a
favor
ed
catmull
more
diplomatic
than
job
be
able
to
reach
a
compromise
new
budget
i
have
a
much
more
positive
view
of
jeffrey
than
some
of
the
folk
work
on
the
film
do
he
say
but
the
incident
do
prompt
job
to
start
plot
about
how
to
have
more
leverage
with
disney
in
the
future
he
do
not
like
be
a
mere
contractor
he
like
be
in
control
that
meant
pixar
would
have
to
bring
its
own
funding
to
project
in
the
future
and
it
would
need
a
new
deal
with
disney
as
the
film
progress
job
become
ever
more
excite
about
it
he
have
be
talk
to
various
company
range
from
hallmark
to
microsoft
about
sell
pixar
but
watch
woody
and
buzz
come
to
life
make
him
realize
that
he
might
be
on
the
verge
of
transform
the
movie
industry
as
scene
from
the
movie
be
finish
he
watch
them
repeatedly
and
have
friend
come
by
his
home
to
share
his
new
passion
i
can
t
tell
you
the
number
of
version
of
toy
story
i
saw
before
it
come
out
say
larry
ellison
it
eventually
become
a
form
of
torture
i
d
go
over
there
and
see
the
late
improvement
steve
be
obsess
with
get
it
right
both
the
story
and
the
technology
and
isn
t
satisfied
with
anything
less
than
perfection
job
s
sense
that
his
investment
in
pixar
might
actually
pay
off
be
reinforce
when
disney
invite
him
to
attend
a
gala
press
preview
of
scene
from
pocahontas

a
master

astound
by
this
plan

great
exhortation
to

and
beyond
suddenly
seem
worth
heed

decide
that
the
release
of
toy

that
november
would
be
the
occasion
to
take
pixar
public
even
the
usually
eager
investment
banker
be
dubious
and
say
it
couldn
t
happen
pixar
have
spent
five
year
hemorrhage
money
but
job
be
determine
i
be
nervous
and
argue
that
we
should
wait
until
after
our
second
movie
lasseter
recall
steve
overrule
me
and
say
we
need
the
cash
so
we
could
put
up
half
the
money
for
our
film
and
renegotiate
the
disney
deal
to

there

a
handful
of
pass
but
the
even
and
its
celebrity

list
be
very
much
a
disney
production
job
do
not
even
attend
instead
the
next
night
he
rent
the
regency
a
similar

and
marketer
help
pixar
roll
out
its
movie
the
answer
be
somewhere
in
between
the
question
would
be
whether
the
ego
involve
mainly
those
of
michael
eisner

job
could
get
to
such
a

be
the
real
thing
and
you
disney
guy
be
shit
recall
michael
eisner
but
we
be
the
one
who
make
toy
story
work
we
help
shape
the
movie
and
we
pull
together
all
of
our
division
from
our
consumer
marketer
to
the
disney
channel
to
make
it
a
hit
job
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fundamental
issue
whose
movie
be
it
would
have
to
be
settle
contractually
rather
than
by
a
war
of
word
after
toy
story
s
success
he
say
i
realize
that
we
need
to
cut
a
new
deal
with
disney
if
we
be
ever
to
build
a
studio
and
not
just
be
a
work
for
hire
place
but
in
order
to
sit
down
with
disney
on
an
equal
basis
pixar
have
to
bring
money
to
the
table
that
require
a
successful
ipo
the
public
offering
occur
exactly
one
week
after
toy
story
s
opening
job
have
gamble
that
the
movie
would
be
successful
and
the
risky
bet
paid
off
big
time
as
with
the
apple
ipo
a
celebration
be
plan
at
the
san
francisco
office
of
the
lead
underwriter
at
a
m
when
the
share
be
to
go
on
sale
the
plan
have
originally
be
for
the
first
share
to
be
offer
at
about
to
be
sure
they
would
sell
job
insist
on
pricing
them
at
which
would
give
the
company
more
money
if
the
offering
be
a
success
it
be
beyond
even
his
wild
hope
it
exceed
netscape
as
the
big
ipo
of
the
year
in
the
first
half
hour
the
stock
shot
up
to
and
trading
have
to
be
delayed
because
there
be
too
many
buy
order
it
then
go
up
even
far
to
before
settle
back
to
close
the
day
at
earlier
that
year
job
have
be
hop
to
find
a
buyer
for
pixar
that
would
let
him
merely
recoup
the
million
he
have
put
in
by
the
end
of
the
day
the
share
he
have
retain
of
the
company
be
worth
more
than
twenty
time
that
an
astonish
billion
that
be
about
five
time
what
he
d
make
when
apple
go
public
in
but
job
told
john
markoff
of
the
new
york
time
that
the
money
do
not
mean
much
to
him
there
s
no
yacht
in
my
future
he
say
i
ve
never
do
this
for
the
money
the
successful
ipo
meant
that
pixar
would
no
longer
have
to
be
dependent
on
disney
to
finance
its
movie
that
be
just
the
leverage
job
want
because
we
could
now
fund
half
the
cost
of
our
movie
i
could
demand
half
the
profit
he
recall
but
more
important
i
want
co
branding
these
be
to
be
pixar
as
well
as
disney
movie
job
flew
down
to
have
lunch
with
eisner
who
be
stun
at
his
audacity
they
have
a
three
picture
deal
and
pixar
have
make
only
one
each
side
have
its
own
nuclear
weapon
after
an
acrimonious
split
with
eisner
katzenberg
have
left
disney
and
become
a
cofounder
with
steven
spielberg
and
david
geffen
of
dreamworks
skg
if
eisner
didn
t
agree
to
a
new
deal
with
pixar
job
say
then
pixar
would
go
to
another
studio
such
as
katzenberg
s
once
the
three
picture
deal
be
do
in
eisner
s
hand
be
the
threat
that
disney
could
if
that
happen
make
its
own
sequel
to
toy
story
use
woody
and
buzz
and
all
of
the
character
that
lasseter
have
create
that
would
have
be
like
molest
our
child
job
later
recall
john
start
cry
when
he
consider
that
possibility
so
they
hammer
out
a
new
arrangement
eisner
agree
to
let
pixar
put
up
half
the
money
for
future
film
and
in
return
take
half
of
the
profit
he
didn
t
think
we
could
have
many
hit
so
he
thought
he
be
save
himself
some
money
say
job
ultimately
that
be
great
for
us
because
pixar
would
have
ten
blockbuster
in
a
row
they
also
agree
on
co
branding
though
that
take
a
lot
of
haggle
to
define
i
take
the
position
that
it
s
a
disney
movie
but
eventually
i
relent
eisner
recall
we
start
negotiate
how
big
the
letter
in
disney
be
go
to
be
how
big
be
pixar
go
to
be
just
like
four
year
old
but
by
the
begin
of
they
have
a
deal
for
five
film
over
the
course
of
ten
year
and
even
part
as
friend
at
least
for
the
time
be
eisner
be
reasonable
and
fair
to
me
then
job
later
say
but
eventually
over
the
course
of
a
decade
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
be
a
dark
man
in
a
letter
to
pixar
shareholder
job
explain
that
win
the
right
to
have
equal
branding
with
disney
on
all
the
movie
as
well
as
advertising
and
toy
be
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
deal
we
want
pixar
to
grow
into
a
brand
that
embodies
the
same
level
of
trust
as
the
disney
brand
he
write
but
in
order
for
pixar
to
earn
this
trust
consumer
must
know
that
pixar
be
create
the
film
job
be
know
during
his
career
for
create
great
product
but
just
as
significant
be
his
ability
to
create
great
company
with
valuable
brand
and
he
create
two
of
the
best
of
his
era
apple
and
pixar
chapter
twenty
three
the

what

the
inevitable
subsequent
step
he
give
up

this
be
a
painful

at

apple

he

also
gloomy
in
an

with
tony
perkins
and
the
editor
of
red
herring
first
he
displayed
the
bad
steve

of
his
personality
soon
after
perkins
and
his
colleague
arrive
job
slip
out
the

later
note
manipulation
selfishness
or
downright
rudeness
we
couldn
t
figure
out
the
motivation
behind
his
madness
when
he
finally
settle
down
for
the
interview
he
say
that
even
the
advent
of
the

would
do
little
to
stop
microsoft
s
domination

it
beat
the

unfortunately
it
beat

o
an

also
for

drive
for

come
at
the
expense
of
gain
market
share
macintosh

apple
troop
job
say
only
one
person
who
can
straighten
out
the
company
the
macintosh
era
have
pass
job
argue
and
it
be
now
time
for
apple
to
create
something
new
that
be
just
as
innovative
if
the
mac
be
dead
what
s
go
to
replace
it
amelio
ask
job
s
reply
didn
t
impress
him
steve
didn
t
seem
to
have
a
clear
answer
amelio
later
say
he
seem
to
have
a
set
of
one
liner
amelio
felt
he
be
witness
job
s
reality
distortion
field
and
be
proud
to
be
immune
to
it
he
shooed
job
unceremoniously
out
of
his
office
by
the
summer
of
amelio
realize
that
he
have
a
serious
problem
apple
be
pin
its
hope
on
create
a
new
operating
system
call
copland
but
amelio
have
discover
soon
after
become
ceo
that
it
be
a
bloat
piece
of
vaporware
that
would
not
solve
apple
s
need
for
well
networking
and
memory
protection
nor
would
it
be
ready
to
ship
as
schedule
in
he
publicly
promise
that
he
would
quickly
find
an
alternative
his
problem
be
that
he
didn
t
have
one
so
apple
need
a
partner
one
that
could
make
a
stable
operating
system
preferably
one
that
be
unix
like
and
have
an
object
orient
application
layer
there
be
one
company
that
could
obviously
supply
such
software
next
but
it
would
take
a
while
for
apple
to
focus
on
it
apple
first
home
in
on
a
company
that
have
be
start
by
jean
louis
gas
e
call
be
gas
e
begin
negotiate
the
sale
of
be
to
apple
but
in
august
he
overplayed
his
hand
at
a
meeting
with
amelio
in
hawaii
he
say
he
want
to
bring
his
fifty
person
team
to
apple
and
he
ask
for
of
the
company
worth
about
million
amelio
be
stun
apple
calculate
that
be
be
worth
about
million
after
a
few
offer
and
counteroffer
gas
e
refuse
to
budge
from
demand
at
least
million
he
thought
that
apple
have
no
alternative
it
get
back
to
amelio
that
gas
e
say
i
ve
get
them
by
the
ball
and
i
m
go
to
squeeze

which
he
felt
could
be
rejiggered
on
the
surface
to
look
and
feel
just
like
a

thrill
to
hear
from
him
and
entrance
by
the
possibility
of
work
with
him
for
me
the
phone
call
with
steve
be
like
inhale
the
flavor
of
a
great
bottle
of
vintage
wine
he
recall
he
give
his
assurance
he
would
make
no
deal
with
be
or
anyone
else
before
they
get
together
for
job
the
contest
against
be
be
both
professional
and
personal
next
be
fail
and
the
prospect
of
be
bought
by
apple
be
a
tantalize
lifeline
in
addition
job
held
grudge
sometimes
passionately
and
gas
e
be
near
the
top
of
his
list
despite
the
fact
that
they
have
seem
to
reconcile
when
job
be
at
next
gas
e
be
one
of
the
few
people
in
my
life
i
would
say
be
truly
horrible
job
later
insist
unfairly
he
knifed
me
in
the
back
in
sculley
to
his
credit
have
at
least
be
gentlemanly
enough
to
knife
job
in
the
front
on
december
steve
job
set
foot
on
apple
s
cupertino
campus
for
the
first
time
since
his
ouster
eleven
year
earlier
in
the
executive
conference
room
he
met
amelio
and
hancock
to
make
the
pitch
for
next
once
again
he
be
scribble
on
the
whiteboard
there
this
time
give
his
lecture
about
the
four
wave
of
computer
system
that
have
culminate
at
least
in
his
tell
with
the
launch
of
next
he
be
at
his
most
seductive
despite
the
fact
that
he
be
speak
to
two
people
he
didn
t
respect
he
be
particularly
adroit
at
feign
modesty
it
s
probably
a
totally
crazy
idea
he
say
but
if
they
found
it
appeal
i
ll
structure
any
kind
of
deal
you
want
license
the
software
sell
you
the
company
whatever
he
be
in
fact
eager
to
sell
everything
and
he
push
that
approach
when
you
take
a
close
look
you
ll
decide
you
want
more
than
my
software
he
told
them
you
ll
want
to
buy
the
whole
company
and
take
all
the
people
a
few
week
later
job
and
his
family
go
to
hawaii
for
christmas
vacation
larry
ellison
be
also
there
as
he
have
be
the
year
before
you
know
larry
i
think
i
ve
found
a
way
for
me
to
get
back
into
apple
and
get
control
of
it
without
you
have
to
buy
it
job
say
as
they
walk
along
the
shore
ellison
recall
he
explain
his
strategy
which
be
get
apple
to
buy
next
then
he
would
go
on
the
board
and
be
one
step
away
from
be
ceo
ellison
thought
that
job
be
miss
a
key
point
but
steve
there
s
one
thing
i
don
t
understand
he
say
if
we
don
t
buy
the
company
how
can
we
make
any
money
it
be
a
reminder
of
how
different
their
desire
be
job
put
his
hand
on
ellison
s
left
shoulder
pull
him
so
close
that
their
nose
almost
touch
and
say
larry
this
be
why
it
s
really
important
that
i
m
your
friend
you
don
t
need
any
more
money
ellison
recall
that
his
own
answer
be
almost
a
whine
well
i
may
not
need
the
money
but
why
should
some
fund
manager
at
fidelity
get
the
money
why
should
someone
else
get
it
why
shouldn
t
it
be
us
i
think
if
i
go
back
to
apple
and
i
didn
t
own
any
of
apple
and
you
didn
t
own
any
of
apple
i
d
have
the
moral
high
ground
job
reply
steve
that
s
really
expensive
real
estate
this
moral
high
ground
say
ellison
look
steve
you
re
my
best
friend
and
apple
be
your
company
i
ll
do
whatever
you
want
although
job
later
say
that
he
be
not
plot
to
take
over
apple
at
the
time
ellison
thought
it
be
inevitable
anyone
who
spent
more
than
a
half
hour
with
amelio
would
realize
that
he
couldn
t
do
anything
but
self
destruct
he
later
say
the
big
bakeoff

provide

simply
say
that

apple
team
knew

capability
of

ask
if

they
sat
at
the
wooden
table
in
front
of
the
open
hearth
pizza
oven
the
financial
part
of
the
negotiation
go
smoothly
job
be
eager
not
to
make
gas
e
s
mistake
of
overreach
he
suggest
that
apple
pay
a
share
for
next
that
would
amount
to
about
million
amelio
say
that
be
too
high
he
counter
with
a
share
or
just
over
million
unlike
be
next
have
an
actual
product
real
revenue
and
a
great
team
but
job
be
nevertheless
pleasantly
surprised
at
that
counteroffer
he
accepted
immediately
one
stick
point
be
that
job
want
his
payout
to
be
in
cash
amelio
insist
that
he
need
to
have
skin
in
the
game
and
take
the
payout
in
stock
that
he
would
agree
to
hold
for
at
least
a
year
job
resist
finally
they
compromise
job
would
take
million
in
cash
and
million
in
stock
and
he
pledge
to
hold
the
stock
for
at
least
six
month
as
usual
job
want
to
have
some
of
their
conversation
while
take
a
walk
while
they
amble
around
palo
alto
he
make
a
pitch
to
be
put
on
apple
s
board
amelio
try
to
deflect
it
say
there
be
too
much
history
to
do
something
like
that
too
quickly
gil
that
really
hurt
job
say
this
be
my
company
i
ve
be
left
out
since
that
horrible
day
with
sculley
amelio
say
he
understood
but
he
be
not
sure
what
the
board
would
want
when
he
be
about
to
begin
his
negotiation
with
job
he
have
make
a
mental
note
to
move
ahead
with
logic
as
my
drill
sergeant
and
sidestep
the
charisma
but
during
the
walk
he
like
so
many
others
be
caught
in
job
s
force
field
i
be
hooked
in
by
steve
s
energy
and
enthusiasm
he
recall
after
circle
the
long
block
a
couple
of
time
they
return
to
the
house
just
as
laurene
and
the
kid
be
arrive
home
they
all
celebrate
the
easy
negotiation
then
amelio
rode
off
in
his
mercedes
he
make
me
feel
like
a
lifelong
friend
amelio
recall
job
indeed
have
a
way
of
do
that
later
after
job
have
engineer
his
ouster
amelio
would
look
back
on
job
s
friendliness
that
day
and
note
wistfully
as
i
would
painfully
discover
it
be
merely
one
facet
of
an
extremely
complex
personality
after
inform
gas
e
that
apple
be
buying
next
amelio
have
what
turn
out
to
be
an
even
more
uncomfortable
task
tell
bill
gate
he
go
into
orbit
amelio
recall
gate
found
it
ridiculous
but
perhaps
not
surprising
that
job
have
pull
off
this
coup
do
you
really
think
steve
job
have
anything
there
gate
ask
amelio
i
know
his
technology
it
s
nothing
but
a
warm
over
unix
and
you
ll
never
be
able
to
make
it
work
on
your
machine
gate
like
job
have
a
way
of
work
himself
up
and
he
do
so
now
don
t
you
understand
that
steve
doesn
t
know
anything
about
technology
he
s
just
a
super
salesman
i
can
t
believe
you
re
make
such
a
stupid
decision
he
doesn
t
know
anything
about
engineering
and
of
what
he
say
and
think
be
wrong
what
the
hell
be
you
buying
that
garbage
for
year
later
when
i
raise
it
with
him
gate
do
not
recall
be
that
upset
the
purchase
of
next
he
argue
do
not
really
give
apple
a
new
operating
system
amelio
paid
a
lot
for
next
and
let
s
be
frank
the
next
o
be
never
really
use
instead
the
purchase
end
up
bring
in
avie
tevanian
who
could
help
the
exist
apple
operating
system
evolve
so
that
it
eventually
incorporate
the
kernel
of
the
next
technology
gate
knew
that
the
deal
be
destine
to
bring
job
back
to
power
but
that
be
a
twist
of
fate
he
say
what
they
end
up
buying
be
a
guy
who
most
people
would
not
have
predict
would
be
a
great
ceo
because
he
didn
t
have
much
experience
at
it
but
he
be
a
brilliant
guy
with
great
design
taste
and
great
engineering
taste
he
suppress
his
craziness
enough
to
get
himself
appoint
interim
ceo
despite
what
both
ellison
and
gate
believe
job
have
deeply
conflict
feeling
about
whether
he
want
to
return
to
an
active
role
at

at
least
while

be
energize
by
the
applause
i
m
very
excite
job
say
i
m
look
forward
to
get
to
reknow
some
old
colleague
louise
kehoe
of
the
financial
time
come
up
to
the
stage
afterward
and
ask

almost
accusatory
whether
he
be
go
to
end
up
take
over
apple
oh
no
louise
he
say
there
be
a
lot
of
other
thing
go
on
in
my
life
now
i
have
a
family
i
be
involve
at
pixar
my
time
be
limited
but
i
hope
i
can
share
some
idea
the
next
day
job
drove
to
pixar
he
have
fall
increasingly
in
love
with
the
place
and
he
want
to
let
the
crew
there
know
he
be
still
go
to
be
president
and
deeply
involve
but
the
pixar
people
be
happy
to
see
him
go
back
to
apple
part
time
a
little
less
of
job
s
focus
would
be
a
good
thing
he
be
useful
when
there
be
big
negotiation
but
he
could
be
dangerous
when
he
have
too
much
time
on
his
hand
when
he
arrive
at
pixar
that
day
he
go
to
lasseter
s
office
and
explain
that
even
just
be
an
advisor
at
apple
would
take
up
a
lot
of
his
time
he
say
he
want
lasseter
s
blessing
i
keep
think
about
all
the
time
away
from
my
family
this
will
cause
and
the
time
away
from
the
other
family
at
pixar
job
say
but
the
only
reason
i
want
to
do
it
be
that
the
world
will
be
a
well
place
with
apple
in
it
lasseter
smile
gently
you
have
my
blessing
he
say
chapter
twenty
four
the
restoration
the
loser
now
will
be
later
to
win
amelio
call
up
wozniak
as
job
hang
back
hover
backstage
it
s
rare
that
you
see
an
artist
in
his
thirty
or
forty
able
to
really
contribute
something
amaze
job
declare
as
he
be
about
to
turn
thirty
that
held
true
for
job
in
his
thirty
during
the
decade
that
begin
with
his
ouster
from
apple
in
but
after
turn
forty
in
he
flourish
toy
story
be
release
that
year
and
the
follow
year
apple
s
purchase
of
next
offer
him
reentry
into
the
company
he
have
found
in
return
to
apple
job
would
show
that
even
people
over
forty
could
be
great
innovator
have
transform
personal
computer
in
his
twenty
he
would
now
help
to
do
the
same
for
music
player
the
record
industry
s
business
model
mobile
phone
apps
tablet
computer
book
and
journalism
he
have
told
larry
ellison
that
his
return
strategy
be
to
sell
next
to
apple
get
appoint
to
the
board
and
be
there
ready
when
ceo
gil
amelio
stumble
ellison
may
have
be
baffle
when
job
insist
that
he
be
not
motivate
by
money
but
it
be
partly
true
he
have
neither
ellison
s
conspicuous
consumption
need
nor
gate
s
philanthropic
impulse
nor
the
competitive
urge
to
see
how
high
on
the
forbes
list
he
could
get
instead
his
ego
need
and
personal
drive
lead
him
to
seek
fulfillment
by
create
a
legacy
that
would
awe
people
a
dual
legacy
actually
building
innovative
product
and
building
a
last
company
he
want
to
be
in
the
pantheon
with
indeed
a
notch
above
people
like
edwin
land
bill
hewlett
and
david
packard
and
the
best
way
to
achieve
all
this
be
to
return
to
apple
and
reclaim
his
kingdom
and
yet
when
the
cup
of
power
near
his
lip
he
become
strangely
hesitant
reluctant
perhaps
coy
he
return
to
apple
officially
in
january
as
a
part
time
advisor
as
he
have
told
amelio
he
would
he
begin
to
assert
himself
in
some
personnel
area
especially
in
protect
his
people
who
have
make
the
transition
from
next
but
in
most
other
way
he
be
unusually
passive
the
decision
not
to
ask
him
to
join
the
board
offend
him
and
he
felt
demean
by
the
suggestion
that
he
run
the
company
s
operating
system
division
amelio
be
thus
able
to
create
a
situation
in
which
job
be
both
inside
the
tent
and
outside
the
tent
which
be
not
a
prescription
for
tranquillity
job
later
recall
gil
didn
t
want
me
around
and
i
thought
he
be
a
bozo
i
knew
that
before
i
sell
him
the
company
i
thought
i
be
just
go
to
be
trot
out
now
and
then
for
event
like
macworld
mainly
for
show
that
be
fine
because
i
be
work
at
pixar
i
rent
an
office
in
downtown
palo
alto
where
i
could
work
a
few
day
a
week
and
i
drove
up
to
pixar
for
one
or
two
day
it
be
a
nice
life
i
could
slow
down
spend
time
with
my
family
job
be
in
fact
trot
out
for
macworld
right
at
the
begin
of
january
and
this
reaffirm
his
opinion
that
amelio
be
a
bozo
close
to
four
thousand
of
the
faithful
fought
for
seat
in
the
ballroom
of
the
san
francisco
marriott
to
hear
amelio
s
keynote
address
he
be
introduce
by
the
actor
jeff
goldblum
i
play
an
expert
in
chaos
theory
in
the
lose
world
jurassic
park
he
say
i
figure
that
will
qualify
me
to
speak
at
an
apple
event
he
then
turn
it
over
to
amelio
who
come
onstage
wear
a
flashy
sport
jacket
and
a
band
collar
shirt
button
tight
at
the
neck
look
like
a
vega
comic
the
wall
street
journal
reporter
jim
carlton
note
or
in
the
word
of
the
technology
writer
michael
malone
look
exactly
like
your
newly
divorce
uncle
on
his
first
date
the
big
problem
be
that
amelio
have
go
on
vacation
gotten
into
a
nasty
tussle
with
his
speechwriter
and
refuse
to
rehearse
when
job
arrive
backstage
he
be
upset
by
the
chaos
and
he
seethe
as
amelio
stood
on
the
podium
bumbling
through
a
disjoint
and
endless
presentation
amelio
be
unfamiliar
with
the
talk
point
that

unlikely
to
succeed
in

apple
and
he
be
intent
upon
replace
them
to
ensure
the
survival
of
his
company
that
month
amelio
have
to
face
the
annual
stockholder
meeting
and
explain
why
the
result
for

their

amelio
be
clueless
about
how
poorly
he
handle
the
meeting
the
presentation
be
regard
as
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
give
he
later
write
but
ed
woolard
the
former
ceo
of
dupont
who
be
now
the
chair
of
the
apple
board
markkula
have
be
demote
to
vice
chair
be
appalled
this
be
a
disaster
his
wife
whisper
to
him
in
the
midst
of
the
session
woolard
agree
gil
come
dress
real
cool
but
he
look
and
sound
silly
he
recall
he
couldn
t
answer
the
question
didn
t
know
what
he
be
talk
about
and
didn
t
inspire
any
confidence
woolard
picked
up
the
phone
and
call
job
whom
he
d
never
met
the
pretext
be
to
invite
him
to
delaware
to
speak
to
dupont
executive
job
decline
but
as
woolard
recall
the
request
be
a
ruse
in
order
to
talk
to
him
about
gil
he
steer
the
phone
call
in
that
direction
and
ask
job
point
blank
what
his
impression
of
amelio
be
woolard
remembers
job
be
somewhat
circumspect
say
that
amelio
be
not
in
the
right
job
job
recall
be
more
blunt
i
thought
to
myself
i
either
tell
him
the
truth
that
gil
be
a
bozo
or
i
lie
by
omission
he
s
on
the
board
of
apple
i
have
a
duty
to
tell
him
what
i
think
on
the
other
hand
if
i
tell
him
he
will
tell
gil
in
which
case
gil
will
never
listen
to
me
again
and
he
ll
fuck
the
people
i
brought
into
apple
all
of
this
take
place
in
my
head
in
less
than
thirty
second
i
finally
decide
that
i
owe
this
guy
the
truth
i
care
deeply
about
apple
so
i
just
let
him
have
it
i
say
this
guy
be
the
bad
ceo
i
ve
ever
see
i
think
if
you
need
a
license
to
be
a
ceo
he
wouldn
t
get
one
when
i
hung
up
the
phone
i
thought
i
probably
just
do
a
really
stupid
thing
that
spring
larry
ellison
saw
amelio
at
a
party
and
introduce
him
to
the
technology
journalist
gina
smith
who
ask
how
apple
be
do
you
know
gina
apple
be
like
a
ship
amelio
answer
that
ship
be
load
with
treasure
but
there
s
a
hole
in
the
ship
and
my
job
be
to
get
everyone
to
row
in
the
same
direction
smith
look
perplexed
and
ask
yeah
but
what
about
the
hole
from
then
on
ellison
and
job
joked
about
the
parable
of
the
ship
when
larry
relayed
this
story
to
me
we
be
in
this
sushi
place
and
i
literally
fell
off
my
chair
laugh
job
recall
he
be
just
such
a
buffoon
and
he
take
himself
so
seriously
he
insist
that
everyone
call
him
dr
amelio
that
s
always
a

well
source
technology
reporter
knew

and
be
familiar
with
his

and
in

he
come

with
a
story

wolf
ellison
s
late
takeover
musing
didn
t
get

so
later
in

somewhat
amuse
by
ellison
s
self
appoint
role
larry
brings
this
up
now
and
then
he
told
a
reporter
i
try
to
explain
my
role
at
apple
be
to
be
an
advisor
amelio
however
be
livid
he
call
ellison
to
dress
him
down
but
ellison
wouldn
t
take
the
call
so
amelio
call
job
whose
response
be
equivocal
but
also
partly
genuine
i
really
don
t
understand
what
be
go
on
he
told
amelio
i
think
all

then
he
add
a
reassurance
that
be
not
at
all
genuine
you
and
i
have
a
good
relationship
job
could
have
end
the
speculation
by
release
a
statement
reject
ellison
s
idea
but
much
to
amelio
s
annoyance
he
didn
t
he
remain
aloof
which
serve
both
his
interest
and
his
nature
by

a
great
bottle
of
wine
to
celebrate
amelio
offer
to
bring
wine
from
his
cellar
and
suggest
that
they
invite
their
wife
it
take
until
june
before
they
settle
on
a
date
and
despite
the
rise
tension
they
be
able
to
have
a
good
time
the
food
and
wine
be
as
mismatch
as
the
diner
amelio
brought
a
bottle
of
cheval
blanc
and
a
montrachet
that
each
cost
about
job
chose
a
vegetarian
restaurant
in
redwood
city
where
the
food
bill
total
amelio
s
wife
remark
afterward
he
s
such
a
charmer
and
his
wife
be
too
job
could
seduce
and
charm
people
at
will
and
he
like
to
do
so
people
such
as
amelio
and
sculley
allow
themselves
to
believe
that
because
job
be
charm
them
it
meant
that
he
like
and
respect
them
it
be
an
impression
that
he
sometimes
foster
by
dish
out
insincere
flattery
to
those
hungry
for
it
but
job
could
be
charm
to
people
he
hat
just
as
easily
as
he
could
be
insult
to
people
he
like
amelio
didn
t
see
this
because
like
sculley
he
be
so
eager
for
job
s
affection
indeed
the
word
he
use
to
describe
his
yearn
for
a
good
relationship
with
job
be
almost
the
same
as
those
use
by
sculley
when
i
be
wrestling
with
a
problem
i
would
walk
through
the
issue
with
him
amelio
recall
nine
time
out
of
ten
we
would
agree
somehow
he
will
himself
to
believe
that
job
really
respect
him
i
be
in
awe
over
the
way
steve
s
mind
approach
problem
and
have
the
feel
we
be
building
a
mutually
trust
relationship
amelio
s
disillusionment
come
a
few
day
after
their
dinner
during
their
negotiation
he
have
insist
that
job
hold
the
apple
stock
he
get
for
at
least
six
month
and
preferably
longer
that
six
month
end
in
june
when
a
block
of
million
share
be
sell
amelio
call
job
i
m
tell
people
that
the
share
sell
be
not
yours
he
say
remember
you
and
i
have
an
understand
that
you
wouldn
t
sell
any
without
advise
us
first
that
s
right
job
reply
amelio
take
that
response
to
mean
that
job
have
not
sell
his
share
and
he
issue
a
statement
say
so
but
when
the
next
sec
filing
come
out
it
reveal
that
job
have
indeed
sell
the
share
dammit
steve
i
ask
you
point
blank
about
these
share
and
you
deny
it
be
you
job
told
amelio
that
he
have
sell
in
a
fit
of
depression
about
where
apple
be
go
and
he
didn
t
want
to
admit
it
because
he
be
a
little
embarrass
when
i
ask
him
about
it
year
later
he
simply
say
i
didn
t
feel
i
need
to
tell
gil
why
do
job
mislead
amelio
about
sell
the
share
one
reason
be
simple
job
sometimes
avoid
the
truth
helmut
sonnenfeldt
once
say
of
henry
kissinger
he
lie
not
because
it
s
in
his
interest
he
lie
because
it
s
in
his
nature
it
be
in
job
s
nature
to
mislead
or
be
secretive
when
he
felt
it
be
warrant
but
he
also
indulge
in
be
brutally
honest
at
time
tell
the
truth
that
most
of
us
sugarcoat
or
suppress
both
the
dissemble
and
the
truth
tell
be
simply
different
aspect
of
his
nietzschean
attitude
that
ordinary
rule
didn
t
apply
to
him
exit
pursue
by
a
bear
job
have
refuse
to
quash
larry
ellison
s
takeover
talk
and
he
have
secretly
sell
his
share
and
be
mislead
about
it
so
amelio
finally
become
convince
that
job
be
gun
for
him
i
finally
absorbed
the
fact
that
i
have
be
too
willing
and
too
eager
to
believe
he
be
on
my
team
amelio
recall
steve
s
plan
to
manipulate
my
termination
be
charge
forward
job
be
indeed
bad
mouth
amelio
at
every
opportunity
he
couldn
t
help
himself
but
there
be
a
more
important
factor
in
turn
the
board
against
amelio
fred
anderson
the
chief
financial
officer
saw
it
as
his
fiduciary
duty
to
keep
ed
woolard
and
the
board
inform
of
apple
s
dire
situation
fred
be
the
guy
tell
me
that
cash
be
drain
people
be
leave
and
more
key
player
be
think
of
it
say
woolard
he
make
it
clear
the
ship
be
go
to
hit
the
sand
soon
and
even
he
be
think
of
leave
that
add
to
the
worry
woolard
already
have
from
watch
amelio
bumble
the
shareholder
meeting
at
an
executive
session
of
the
board
in
june
with
amelio
out
of
the
room
woolard
described
to
current
director
how
he
calculate
their
odds
if
we
stay
with
gil
as
ceo
i
think
there
s
only
a
chance
we
will
avoid
bankruptcy
he
say
if
we
fire
him
and
convince
steve
to
come
take
over
we
have
a
chance
of
survive
if
we
fire
gil
don
t
get
steve
back
and
have
to
search
for
a
new
ceo
then
we
have
a
chance
of
survive
the
board
give
him
authority
to
ask
job
to
return
woolard
and
his
wife
flew
to
london
where
they
be

wimbledon

but
decline

the
board
chairman
that
s
all
i
can

now
he
say
after
rumor

circulate
he
email
a
memo
to
pixar
employee

them
that
he
be
not

them
i
get
a
call
from
apple
s
board
of
director
three
week
ago
ask
me
to

to
apple
as
their
ceo
he
write
i
decline
they
then
ask
me
to
become
chairman
and
i
again
decline
so
don
t
worry
the
crazy
rumor
be
just
that
i
have
no
plan
to
leave
pixar
you
re
stuck
with
me
why
do
job
not
seize
the
rein
why
be
he
reluctant
to
grab
the
job
that
for
two
decade
he
have
seem
to
desire
when
i
ask
him
he
say
we
d
just
take
pixar
public
and
i
be
happy
be
ceo
there
i
never
knew
of
anyone
who
serve
as
ceo
of
two
public
company
even
temporarily
and
i
wasn
t
even
sure
it
be
legal
i
didn
t
know
what
i
want
to
do
i
be
enjoy
spending
more
time
with
my
family
i
be
torn
i
knew
apple
be
a
mess
so
i
wonder
do
i
want
to
give
up
this
nice
lifestyle
that
i
have
what
be
all
the
pixar
shareholder
go
to
think
i
talk
to
people
i
respect
i
finally
call
andy
grove
at
about
eight
one
saturday
morning
too
early
i
give
him
the
pro
and
the
con
and
in
the
middle
he
stop
me
and
say
steve
i
don
t
give
a
shit
about
apple
i
be
stun
it
be
then
i
realize
that
i
do
give
a
shit
about
apple
i
start
it
and
it
be
a
good
thing
to
have
in
the
world
that
be
when
i
decide
to
go
back
on
a
temporary
basis
to
help
them
hire
a
ceo
the
claim
that
he
be
enjoy
spending
more
time
with
his
family
be
not
convincing
he
be
never
destine
to
win
a
father
of
the
year
trophy
even
when
he
have
spare
time
on
his
hand
he
be
get
well
at
pay
heed
to
his
child
especially
reed
but
his
primary
focus
be
on
his
work
he
be
frequently
aloof
from
his
two
young
daughter
estrange
again
from
lisa
and
often
prickly
as
a
husband
so
what
be
the
real
reason
for
his
hesitancy
in
take
over
at
apple
for
all
of
his
willfulness
and
insatiable
desire
to
control
thing
job
be
indecisive
and
reticent
when
he
felt
unsure
about
something
he
crave
perfection
and
he
be
not
always
good
at
figure
out
how
to
settle
for
something
less
he
do
not
like
to
wrestle
with
complexity
or
make
accommodation
this
be
true
in
product
design
and
furnishing
for
the
house
it
be
also
true
when
it
come
to
personal
commitment
if
he
knew
for
sure
a
course
of
action
be
right
he
be
unstoppable
but
if
he
have
doubt
he
sometimes
withdrew
prefer
not
to
think
about
thing
that
do
not
perfectly
suit
him
as
happen
when
amelio
have
ask
him
what
role
he
want
to
play
job
would
go
silent
and
ignore
situation
that
make
him
uncomfortable
this
attitude
arose
partly
out
of
his
tendency
to
see
the
world
in
binary
term
a
person
be
either
a
hero
or
a
bozo
a
product
be
either
amaze
or
shit
but
he
could
be
stymie
by
thing
that
be
more
complex
shade
or
nuanced
get
married
buying
the
right
sofa
commit
to
run
a
company
in
addition
he
didn
t
want
to
be
set
up
for
failure
i
think
steve
want
to
ass
whether
apple
could
be
save
fred
anderson
say
woolard
and
the
board
decide
to
go
ahead
and
fire
amelio
even
though
job
be
not
yet
forthcoming
about
how
active
a
role
he
would
play
as
an
advisor
amelio
be
about
to
go
on
a
picnic
with
his
wife
child
and
grandchild
when
the
call
come
from
woolard
in
london
we
need
you
to
step
down
woolard
say
simply
amelio
reply
that
it
be
not
a
good
time
to
discus
this
but
woolard
felt
he
have
to
persist
we
be
go
to
announce
that
we
re
replace
you
amelio
resist
remember
ed
i
told
the
board
it
be
go
to
take
three
year
to
get
this
company
back
on
its
foot
again
he
say
i
m
not
even
halfway
through
the
board
be
at
the
place
where
we
don
t
want
to
discus
it
far
woolard
reply
amelio
ask
who
knew
about
the
decision
and
woolard
told
him
the
truth
the
rest
of
the
board
plus
job
steve
be
one
of
the
people
we
talk
to
about
this
woolard
say
his
view
be
that
you
re
a
really
nice
guy
but
you
don
t
know
much
about
the
computer
industry
why
in
the
world
would
you
involve
steve
in
a
decision
like
this
amelio
reply
get
angry
steve
be
not
even
a
member
of
the
board
of
director
so
what
the
hell
be
he
do
in
any
of
this
conversation
but
woolard
didn
t
back
down
and
amelio
hung
up
to
carry
on
with
the
family
picnic
before
tell
his
wife
at
time
job
displayed
a
strange
mixture
of
prickliness
and
neediness
he
usually
didn
t
care
one
iota
what
people
thought
of
him
he
could
cut
people
off
and
never
care
to
speak
to
them
again
yet
sometimes
he
also
felt
a
compulsion
to
explain
himself
so
that
even
amelio
receive
to
his
surprise
a
phone
call
from
job
gee
gil
i
just
want
you
to
know
i
talk
to
ed
today
about
this
thing
and
i
really
feel
bad
about
it
he
say
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this
turn
of
event
it
be
a
decision
the
board
make
but
they
have
ask
me
for
advice
and
counsel
he
told
amelio
he
respect
him
for
have
the
high
integrity
of
anyone
i
ve
ever
met
and
go
on
to
give
some
unsolicited
advice
take
six
month
off
job
told
him
when
i
get
thrown
out
of
apple
i
immediately
go
back
to
work
and
i
regret
it
he
offer
to
be
a

be
cut
and
cold
especially
toward

sentimental
about

notably
whether

the
showdown
have
become
explosive
microsoft
refuse
to
commit
to
develop
word
and
excel
for
future
macintosh
operating
system
which
could
have
destroyed
apple
in
defense
of
bill
gate
he
be
not
simply
be
vindictive
it
be
understandable
that
he
be
reluctant
to
commit
to
develop
for
a
future
macintosh
operating
system
when
no
one
include
the
ever
change
leadership
at
apple
seem
to
know
what
that
new
operating
system
would
be
right
after
apple
bought
next
amelio
and
job
flew
together
to
visit
microsoft
but
gate
have
trouble
figure
out
which
of
them
be
in
charge
a
few
day
later
he
call
job
privately
hey
what
the
fuck
be
i
suppose
to
put
my
application
on
the
next
o
gate
ask
job
respond
by
make
smart
as
remark
about
gil
gate
recall
and
suggest
that
the
situation
would
soon
be
clarify
when
the
leadership
issue
be
partly
resolve
by
amelio
s
ouster
one
of
job
s
first
phone
call
be
to
gate
job
recall
i
call
up
bill
and
say
i
m
go
to
turn
this
thing
around
bill
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
apple
we
get
him
into
the
application
software
business
the
first
microsoft
apps
be
excel
and
word
for
the
mac
so
i
call
him
and
say
i
need
help
microsoft
be
walk
over
apple
s
patent
i
say
if
we
kept
up
our
lawsuit
a
few
year
from
now
we
could
win
a
billion
dollar
patent
suit
you
know
it
and
i
know
it
but
apple
s
not
go
to
survive
that
long
if
we
re
at
war
i
know
that
so
let
s
figure
out
how
to
settle
this
right
away
all
i
need
be
a
commitment
that
microsoft
will
keep
develop
for
the
mac
and
an
investment
by
microsoft
in
apple
so
it
have
a
stake
in
our
success
when
i
recount
to
him
what
job
say
gate
agree
it
be
accurate
we
have
a
group
of
people
who
like
work
on
the
mac
stuff
and
we
like
the
mac
gate
recall
he
have
be
negotiate
with
amelio
for
six
month
and
the
proposal
kept
get
longer
and
more
complicate
so
steve
come
in
and
say
hey
that
deal
be
too
complicate
what
i
want
be
a
simple
deal
i
want
the
commitment
and
i
want
an
investment
and
so
we
put
that
together
in
just
four
week
gate
and
his
chief
financial
officer
greg
maffei
make
the
trip
to
palo
alto
to
work

the
framework
for
a

work
on
the
detail
when
he

gasped
in
horror

by
some
boo
and
catcall
the
scene
be
such
a
brutal
echo
of
the
big
brother
ad
that
you
half
expect
and
hop
that
an
athletic
woman
would
suddenly
come
run
down
the
aisle
and
vaporize
the
screenshot
with
a
well
thrown
hammer
but
it
be
all
for
real
and
gate
unaware
of
the
jeering
begin
speak
on
the
satellite
link
from
microsoft
headquarters
some
of
the
most
excite
work
that
i
ve
do
in
my
career
have
be
the
work
that
i
ve
do
with
steve
on
the
macintosh
he
intone
in
his
high
pitch
singsong
as
he
go
on
to
tout
the
new
version
of
microsoft
office
that
be
be
make
for
the
macintosh
the
audience
quiet
down
and
then
slowly
seem
to
accept
the
new
world
order
gate
even
be
able
to
rouse
some
applause
when
he
say
that
the
new
mac
version
of
word
and
excel
would
be
in
many
way
more
advanced
than
what
we
ve
do
on
the
window
platform
job
realize
that
the
image
of
gate
loom
over
him
and
the
audience
be
a
mistake
i
want
him
to
come
to
boston
job
later
say
that
be
my
bad
and
stupidest
stag
event
ever
it
be
bad
because
it
make
me
look
small
and
apple
look
small
and
as
if
everything
be
in
bill
s
hand
gate
likewise
be
embarrass
when
he
saw
the
videotape
of
the
event
i
didn
t
know
that
my
face
be
go
to
be
blown
up
to
loom
proportion
he
say
job
try
to
reassure
the
audience
with
an
impromptu
sermon
if
we
want
to
move
forward
and
see
apple
healthy
again
we
have
to
let
go
of
a
few
thing
here
he
told
the
audience
we
have
to
let
go
of
this
notion
that
for
apple
to
win
microsoft
have
to
lose
i
think
if
we
want
microsoft
office
on
the
mac
we
well
treat
the
company
that
put
it
out
with
a
little
bit
of
gratitude
the
microsoft
announcement
along
with
job
s
passionate
reengagement
with
the
company
provide
a
much
need
jolt
for
apple
by
the
end
of
the
day
its
stock
have
skyrocket
or
to
close
at
twice
the
price
of
the
day
amelio
resign
the
one
day
jump
add
million
to

job
and
clow
agree
that
apple
be
one
of
the
great
brand
of
the
world
probably
in
the
top
five
base
on
emotional
appeal
but
they
need
to
remind
folk
what
be
distinctive
about
it
so
they
want
a
brand
image
campaign
not
a
set
of
advertisement
feature
product
it
be
design
to
celebrate
not
what
the
computer
could
do
but
what
creative
people
could
do
with
the
computer
this
wasn
t
about
processor
speed
or
memory
job
recall
it
be
about
creativity
it
be
direct
not
only
at
potential
customer
but
also
at
apple
s
own
employee
we
at
apple
have
forgotten
who
we
be
one
way
to
remember
who
you
be
be
to
remember
who
your
hero
be
that
be
the
genesis
of
that
campaign
clow
and
his
team
try
a
variety
of
approach
that
praise
the
crazy
one
who
think
different
they
do
one
video
with
the
seal
song
crazy
we
re
never
gonna
survive
unless
we
get
a
little
crazy
but
couldn
t
get
the
right
to
it
then
they
try
version
use
a
record
of
robert
frost
reading
the
road
not
take
and
of
robin
williams
s
speech
from
dead
poet
society
eventually
they
decide
they
need
to
write
their
own
text
their
draft
begin
here
s
to
the
crazy
one
job
be
as
demand
as
ever
when
clow
s
team
flew
up
with
a
version
of
the
text
he
explode
at
the
young
copywriter
this
be
shit
he
yell
it
s
advertising
agency
shit
and
i
hate
it
it
be
the
first
time
the
young
copywriter
have
met
job
and
he
stood
there
mute
he
never
go
back
but
those
who
could
stand
up
to
job
include
clow
and
his
teammate
ken
segall
and
craig
tanimoto
be
able
to
work
with
him
to
create
a
tone
poem
that
he
like
in
its
original
sixty
second
version
it
read
here
s
to
the
crazy
one
the
misfit
the
rebel
the
troublemaker
the
round
peg
in
the
square
hole
the
one
who
see
thing
differently
they
re
not
fond
of
rule
and
they
have
no
respect
for
the
status
quo
you
can
quote
them
disagree
with
them
glorify
or
vilify
them
about
the
only
thing
you
can
t
do
be
ignore
them
because
they
change
thing
they
push
the
human
race
forward
and
while
some
may
see
them
as
the
crazy
one
we
see
genius
because
the
people
who
be
crazy
enough
to
think
they
can
change
the
world
be
the
one
who
do
job
who
could
identify
with
each
of
those
sentiment
write
some
of
the
line
himself
include
they
push
the
human
race
forward
by
the
time
of
the
boston
macworld
in
early
august
they
have
produce
a
rough
version
they
agree
it
be
not
ready
but
job
use
the
concept
and
the
think
different
phrase
in
his
keynote
speech
there
there
s
a
germ
of
a
brilliant
idea
there
he
say
at
the
time
apple
be
about
people
who
think
outside
the
box
who
want
to
use
computer
to
help
them
change
the
world
they
debate
the
grammatical
issue
if
different
be
suppose
to
modify
the
verb
think
it
should
be
an
adverb
as
in
think
differently
but
job
insist
that
he
want
different
to
be
use
as
a
noun
as
in
think
victory
or
think
beauty
also
it
echoed
colloquial
use
as
in
think
big
job
later
explain
we
discuss
whether
it
be
correct
before
we
ran
it
it
s
grammatical
if
you
think
about
what
we
re
try
to
say
it
s
not
think
the
same
it
s
think
different
think
a
little
different
think
a
lot
different
think
different
think
differently
wouldn
t
hit
the
meaning
for
me
in
order
to
evoke
the
spirit
of
dead
poet
society
clow
and
job
want
to
get
robin
williams
to
read

get
through
to
williams
s
wife
who
would
not
let
him
talk
to
the
actor
because
she
knew
how
persuasive
he
could
be
they

job
s
favorite
before
it
ran
i
be
in
new
york
and
i
go
to
this
small
japanese
restaurant
that
i
love
and
let
her
know
i
would
be
there
he
recall
when
he
arrive
she
come
over
to
his
table
this
be
a
well
one
she
say
hand

thought
i
would

have
this
with
me
it
be
the
classic
photo
of
her
and
john
in
bed
together
hold
flower
and
it
be
the
one
that
apple
end
up
use
i
can
see
why
john
fell
in
love
with
her
job
recall
the
narration
by
richard
dreyfus
work
well
but
lee
clow
have
another
idea
what
if
job
do
the
voice
over
himself
you
really
believe
this
clow
told
him
you
should
do
it
so
job
sat
in
a
studio
do
a
few
take
and
soon
produce
a
voice
track
that
everyone
like
the
idea
be
that
if
they
use
it
they
would
not
tell
people
who
be
speak
the
word
just
as
they
didn
t
caption
the
iconic
picture
eventually
people
would
figure
out
it
be
job
this
will
be
really
powerful
to
have
it
in
your
voice
clow
argue
it
will
be
a
way
to
reclaim
the
brand
job
couldn
t
decide
whether
to
use
the
version
with
his
voice
or
to
stick
with
dreyfus
finally
the
night
come
when
they
have
to
ship
the
ad
it
be
due
to
air
appropriately
enough
on
the
television
premiere
of
toy
story
as
be
often
the
case
job
do
not
like
to
be
force
to
make
a
decision
he
told
clow
to
ship
both
version
this
would
give
him
until
the
morning
to
decide
when
morning
come
job
call
and
told
them
to
use
the
dreyfus
version
if
we
use
my
voice
when
people
find
out
they
will
say
it
s
about
me
he
told
clow
it
s
not
it
s
about
apple
ever
since
he
left
the
apple
commune
job
have
define
himself
and
by
extension
apple
as
a
child
of
the
counterculture
in
ad
such
as
think
different
and
he
position
the
apple
brand
so
that
it
reaffirm
his
own
rebel
streak
even
after
he
become
a
billionaire
and
it
allow
other
baby
boomer
and
their
kid
to
do
the
same
from
when
i
first
met
him
as
a
young
guy
he
s
have
the
great
intuition
of
the
impact
he
want
his
brand
to
have
on
people
say
clow
very
few
other
company
or
corporate
leader
perhaps
none
could
have
gotten
away
with
the
brilliant
audacity
of
associate
their
brand
with
gandhi
einstein
picasso
and
the
dalai
lama
job
be
able
to
encourage
people
to
define
themselves
as
anticorporate

and
i
couldn

i
literally
couldn
t
i
be
so
exhaust
i
couldn
t
speak
to
laurene
all
i
could
do
be

a
half
hour
of

and
vegetate
it
get
close
to
kill
me
i

and
down
to
apple
in
a
black
porsche
convertible
and
i
start
to
get
kidney
stone
i
would
rush

hospital
and
the
hospital
would
give
me
a
shot
of
demerol
in
the
butt
and
eventually
i
would
pas
it
despite
the
grueling
schedule
the
more
that
job
immerse
himself
in
apple
the
more
he
realize
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
walk
away
when
michael
dell
be
ask
at
a
computer
trade
show
in
october
what
he
would
do
if
he
be
steve
job
and
take
over
apple
he
reply
i
d
shut
it
down
and
give
the
money
back
to
the
shareholder
job
fire
off
an
email
to
dell
ceo
be
suppose
to
have
class
it
say
i
can
see
that
isn
t
an
opinion
you
hold
job
like
to
stoke
up
rivalry
as
a
way
to
rally
his
team
he
have
do
so
with
ibm
and
microsoft
and
he
do
so
with
dell
when
he
call
together
his
manager
to
institute
a
build
to
order
system
for
manufacturing
and
distribution
job
use
as
a
backdrop
a
blown
up
picture
of
michael
dell
with
a
target
on
his
face
we
re
come
after
you
buddy
he
say
to
cheer
from
his
troop
one
of
his
motivate
passion
be
to
build
a
last
company
at
age
twelve
when
he
get
a
summer
job
at
hewlett
packard
he
learn
that
a
properly
run
company
could
spawn
innovation
far
more
than
any
single
creative
individual
i
discover
that
the
best
innovation
be
sometimes
the
company
the
way
you
organize
a
company
he
recall
the
whole
notion
of
how
you
build
a
company
be
fascinate
when
i
get
the
chance
to
come
back
to
apple
i
realize
that
i
would
be
useless
without
the
company
and
that
s
why
i
decide
to
stay
and
rebuild
it
kill
the
clone
one
of
the
great
debate
about
apple
be
whether
it
should
have
license
its
operating
system
more
aggressively
to
other
computer
maker
the
way
microsoft
license
window
wozniak
have
favor
that
approach
from
the
begin
we
have
the
most
beautiful
operating
system
he
say
but
to
get
it
you
have
to
buy
our
hardware
at
twice
the
price
that
be
a
mistake
what
we
should
have
do
be
calculate
an
appropriate
price
to
license
the
operating
system
alan
kay
the
star
of
xerox
parc
who
come
to
apple
as
a
fellow
in
also
fought
hard
for
licensing
the
mac
o
software
software
people
be
always
multiplatform
because
you
want
to
run
on
everything
he
recall
and
that
be
a
huge
battle
probably
the
large
battle
i
lose
at
apple
bill
gate
who
be
building
a
fortune
by
licensing
microsoft
s
operating
system
have
urge
apple
to
do
the
same
in
just
as
job
be
be
ease
out
gate
believe
that
even
if
apple
take
away
some
of
microsoft
s
operating
system
customer
microsoft
could
make
money
by
create
version
of
its
application
software
such
as
word
and
excel
for
the
user
of
the
macintosh
and
its
clone
i
be
try
to
do
everything
to
get
them
to
be
a
strong
licensor
he
recall
he
sent
a
formal
memo
to
sculley
make
the
case
the
industry
have
reach
the
point
where
it
be
now
impossible
for
apple
to
create
a
standard
out
of
their
innovative
technology
without
support
from
and
the
result
credibility
of
other
personal
computer
manufacturer
he
argue
apple
should
license
macintosh
technology
to
significant
manufacturer
for
the
development
of
mac
compatibles
gate
get
no
reply
so
he
write
a
second
memo
suggest
some
company
that
would
be
good
at
clone
the
mac
and
he
add
i
want
to
help
in
any
way
i
can
with
the
licensing
please
give
me
a
call
apple
resist
licensing
out
the
macintosh
operating
system
until
when
ceo
michael
spindler
allow
two
small
company
power
compute
and
radius
to
make
macintosh
clone
when
gil
amelio
take
over
in
he
add
motorola
to
the
list
it
turn
out
to
be
a
dubious
business
strategy
apple
get
an
licensing
fee
for
each
computer
sell
but
instead
of
expand
the
market
the
cloners
cannibalize
the
sale
of
apple
s
own
high
end
computer
on
which
it
make
up
to
in
profit
job
s
objection
to
the
clone
program
be
not
just
economic
however
he
have
an
inbred
aversion
to
it
one
of
his
core
principle
be
that
hardware
and
software
should
be
tightly
integrate
he
love
to
control
all
aspect
of
his
life
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
with
computer
be
to
take
responsibility
for
the
user
experience
from
end
to
end
so
upon
his
return
to
apple
he
make
kill
the
macintosh
clone
a
priority
when
a
new
version
of
the
mac
operating
system
ship
in
july
week
after
he
have
help
oust
amelio
job
do
not
allow
the
clone
maker
to
upgrade
to
it
the
head
of
power
compute
stephen
king
kahng
organize
pro
clone
protest
when
job
appear
at
boston
macworld
that
august
and
publicly
warn
that
the
macintosh
o
would
die
if
job
decline
to
keep
licensing
it
out
if
the
platform
go
close
it
be
over
kahng
say
total
destruction
close
be
the
kiss
of
death
job
disagreed
he
telephone
ed
woolard
to
say
he
be
get
apple
out
of
the
licensing
business
the
board
acquiesce
and
in
september
he
reach
a
deal
to
pay
power
compute
million
to
relinquish
its
license
and
give
apple
access
to
its
database
of
customer
he
soon
terminate
the
license
of
the
other
cloners
as
well
it
be
the
dumbest
thing
in
the
world
to
let
company
make
crappier
hardware
use
our
operating
system
and
cut
into
our
sale
he
later
say
product
line
review
one
of
job
s
great
strength
be
know
how
to
focus
decide
what
not
to
do
be
as
important
as
decide
what
to
do
he
say
that
s
true
for
company
and
it
s
true
for
product
he
go
to
work
apply
this
principle
as
soon
as
he
return
to
apple
one
day
he
be
walk
the
hall
and
ran
into
a
young
wharton
school
graduate
who
have
be
amelio
s
assistant
and
who
say
he
be
wrap
up
his
work
well
good
because
i
need
someone
to
do
grunt
work
job
told
him
his
new
role
be
to
take
note
as
job
met
with
the
dozen
of
product
team
at
apple
ask
them
to
explain
what
they
be
do
and
force
them
to
justify
go
ahead
with
their
product
or
project
he
also
enlist
a
friend
phil
schiller
who
have
work
at
apple
but
be
then
at
the
graphic
software
company
macromedia
steve
would
summon
the
team
into
the
boardroom
which
seat
twenty
and
they
would
come
with
thirty
people
and
try
to
show
powerpoints
which
steve
didn
t
want
to
see
schiller
recall
one
of
the
first
thing
job
do
during
the
product
review
process
be
ban
powerpoints
i
hate
the
way
people
use
slide
presentation
instead
of
think
job
later
recall
people
would
confront
a
problem
by
create
a
presentation
i
want
them
to
engage
to
hash
thing
out
at
the
table
rather
than
show
a
bunch
of
slide
people
who
know
what
they
re
talk
about
don
t
need
powerpoint
the
product
review
reveal
how
unfocused
apple
have
become
the
company
be
churn
out
multiple
version
of
each
product
because
of
bureaucratic
momentum
and
to
satisfy
the
whim
of
retailer
it
be
insanity
schiller
recall
ton
of
product
most
of
them
crap
do
by
delude
team
apple
have
a
dozen
version
of
the
macintosh
each
with
a
different
confuse
number
range
from
to
i
have
people
explain
this
to
me
for
three
week
job
say
i
couldn
t
figure
it
out
he
finally
begin
ask
simple
question
like
which
one
do
i
tell
my
friend
to
buy
when
he
couldn
t
get
simple
answer
he
begin
slash
away
at
model
and
product
soon
he
have
cut
of
them
you
be
bright
people
he
told
one
group
you
shouldn
t
be
waste
your
time
on
such
crappy
product
many
of
the
engineer
be
infuriate
at
his
slash
and
burn
tactic
which
result
in
massive
layoff
but
job
later
claimed
that
the
good
engineer
include
some
whose
project
be
kill
be
appreciative
he
told
one
staff
meeting
in
september
i
come
out
of
the
meeting
with
people
who
have
just
gotten
their
product
cancel
and
they
be
three
foot
off
the
ground
with
excitement
because
they
finally
understood
where
in
the
heck
we
be
go
after
a
few
week
job
finally
have
enough
stop
he
shout
at
one
big
product
strategy
session
this
be
crazy
he
grabbed
a
magic
marker
pad
to
a
whiteboard
and
drew
a
horizontal
and
vertical
line
to
make
a
four
square
chart
here
s
what
we
need
he
continued
atop
the
two
column
he
write

recall
there
be
also
a
stun

the
plan
to
the
september
meeting
of
the

steve
come
in
and
say
we
need
few
he
drew
a
matrix
with
four
quadrant
and
say
that
this
be
where
we
should
focus
at
first
the
board
push
back
it
be
a
risk
job
be
told
i
can
make
it
work
he
reply
the
board
never
vote
on
the
new
strategy
job
be
in
charge
and
he
forge
ahead
the
result
be
that
the
apple
engineer
and
manager
suddenly
become
sharply
focus
on
just
four
area
for
the
professional
desktop
quadrant
they
would
work
on
make
the
power
macintosh
g
for
the
professional
portable
there
would
be
the
powerbook
g
for
the
consumer
desktop
work
would
begin
on
what
become
the
imac
and
for
the
consumer
portable
they
would
focus
on
what
would
become
the
ibook
the
i
job
later
explain
be
to
emphasize
that
the
device
would
be
seamlessly
integrate
with
the
internet
apple
s
sharper
focus
meant
get
the
company
out
of
other
business
such
as
printer
and
server
in
apple
be
sell
stylewriter
color

that
be
basically
a
version
of
the
hewlett
packard
deskjet
hp
make
most
of
its
money
by
sell
the
ink

i
don
t
understand
job
say
at
the
product
review
meeting
you
re
go
to
ship
a
million
and
not
make
money
on
these
this
be
nut
he
left
the
room
and
call
the
head
of
hp
let
s
tear
up
our
arrangement
job
propose
and
we
will
get
out
of
the
printer
business
and
just
let
you
do
it
then
he
come
back
to
the
boardroom
and
announce
the
decision
steve
look
at
the
situation
and
instantly
knew
we
need
to
get
outside
of
the
box
schiller
recall
the
most
visible
decision
he
make
be
to
kill
once
and
for
all
the
newton
the
personal
digital
assistant
with
the
almost
good
handwrite
recognition
system
job
hat
it
because
it
be
sculley
s
pet
project
because
it
didn
t
work
perfectly
and
because
he
have
an
aversion
to
stylus
device
he
have
try
to
get
amelio
to
kill
it
early
in
and
succeed
only
in
convincing
him
to
try
to
spin
off
the
division
by
late
when
job
do
his
product
review
it
be
still
around
he
later
described
his
think
if
apple
have
be
in
a
less
precarious
situation
i
would
have
drill
down
myself
to
figure
out
how
to
make
it
work
i
didn
t
trust
the
people
run
it
my
gut
be
that
there
be
some
really
good
technology
but
it
be
fuck
up
by
mismanagement
by
shut
it
down
i
freed
up
some
good
engineer
who
could
work
on
new
mobile
device
and
eventually
we
get
it
right
when
we
move
on
to
iphones
and
the
ipad
this
ability
to
focus
save
apple
in
his
first
year
back
job
laid
off
more
than
three
thousand
people
which
salvage
the
company
s
balance
sheet
for
the
fiscal
year
that
end
when
job
become
interim
ceo
in
september
apple
lose
billion
we
be
less
than
ninety
day
from
be
insolvent
he
recall
at
the
january
san
francisco
macworld
job
take
the
stage
where
amelio
have
bombed
a
year
earlier
he
sport
a
full
beard
and
a
leather
jacket
as
he
tout
the
new
product
strategy
and
for
the
first
time
he
end
the
presentation
with
a
phrase
that
he
would
make
his
signature
coda
oh
and
one
more
thing
this
time
the
one
more
thing
be
think
profit
when
he
say
those
word
the
crowd
erupt
in
applause
after
two
year
of
stagger
loss
apple
have
enjoy
a
profitable
quarter
make
million
for
the
full
fiscal

the
studio
of
job
and
ive
with
jony
ive
and
the
sunflower
imac
jony
ive
when
job
gather
his
top
management
for
a
pep
talk
just
after
he
become
iceo
in
september
sit
in
the
audience
be
a
sensitive
and
passionate
thirty
year
old
brit
who
be
head
of
the
company
s
design
team
jonathan
ive
know
to
all
as
jony
be
planning
to
quit
he
be
sick
of
the
company
s
focus
on
profit
maximization
rather
than
product
design
job
s
talk
lead
him
to
reconsider
i
remember
very
clearly
steve
announce
that
our
goal
be
not
just
to
make
money
but
to
make
great
product
ive
recall
the
decision
you
make
base
on
that
philosophy
be
fundamentally
different
from
the
one
we
have
be
make
at
apple
ive
and
job
would
soon
forge
a
bond
that
would
lead
to
the
great
industrial
design
collaboration
of
their
era
ive
grow
up
in
chingford
a
town
on
the
northeast
edge
of
london
his
father
be
a
silversmith
who
taught
at
the
local
college
he
s
a
fantastic
craftsman
ive
recall
his
christmas
gift
to
me
would
be
one
day
of
his
time
in
his
college
workshop
during
the
christmas
break
when
no
one
else
be
there
help
me
make
whatever
i
dream
up
the
only
condition
be
that
jony
have
to
draw
by
hand
what
they
plan
to
make
i
always
understood
the
beauty
of
thing
make
by
hand
i
come
to
realize
that
what
be
really
important
be
the
care
that
be
put
into
it
what
i
really
despise
be
when
i
sense
some
carelessness
in
a
product
ive
enrol
in
newcastle
polytechnic
and
spent
his
spare
time
and
summer
work
at
a
design
consultancy
one
of
his
creation
be
a
pen
with
a
little
ball
on
top
that
be
fun
to
fiddle
with
it
help
give
the
owner
a
playful
emotional
connection
to
the
pen
for
his
thesis
he
design
a
microphone
and
earpiece
in
purest
white
plastic
to
communicate
with
hearing
impaired
kid
his
flat
be
fill
with
foam
model
he
have
make
to
help
him
perfect
the
design
he
also
design
an
atm
machine
and
a
curve
phone
both
of
which
won
award
from
the
royal
society
of
art
unlike
some
designer
he
didn
t
just
make
beautiful
sketch
he
also
focus
on
how
the
engineering
and
inner
component
would
work
he
have
an
epiphany
in
college
when
he
be
able
to
design
on
a
macintosh
i
discover
the
mac
and
felt
i
have
a
connection
with
the
people
who
be
make
this
product
he
recall
i
suddenly
understood
what
a
company
be
or
be
suppose
to
be
after
graduation
ive
help
to
build
a
design
firm
in
london
tangerine
which
get
a
consult
contract
with
apple
in
he
move
to
cupertino
to
take
a
job
in
the
apple
design
department
he
become
the
head
of
the
department
in
the
year
before
job
return
but
wasn
t
happy
amelio
have
little
appreciation
for
design
there
wasn
t
that
feel
of
put
care
into
a
product
because
we
be
try
to
maximize
the
money
we
make
ive
say
all
they
want
from
us
designer
be
a
model
of
what
something
be
suppose
to
look
like
on
the
outside
and
then
engineer
would
make
it
as
cheap
as
possible
i
be
about
to
quit
when
job
take
over
and
give
his
pep
talk
ive
decide
to
stick
around
but
job
at
first
look
around
for
a
world
class
designer
from
the
outside
he
talk
to
richard
sapper
who
design
the
ibm
thinkpad
and
giorgetto
giugiaro
who
design
the
ferrari
and
the
maserati
ghibli
but
then
he
take
a
tour
of
apple
s
design
studio
and
bond
with
the
affable
eager
and
very
earnest
ive
we
discuss
approach
to
form
and
material
ive
recall
we
be
on
the
same
wavelength
i
suddenly
understood
why
i
love
the
company
ive
report
at
least
initially
to
jon
rubinstein
whom
job
have
brought
in
to
head
the
hardware
division
but
he
developed
a
direct
and
unusually
strong
relationship
with
job
they
begin
to
have
lunch
together
regularly
and
job
would
end
his
day
by
drop
by
ive
s
design
studio
for
a
chat
jony
have
a
special
status
say
laurene
powell
he
would
come
by
our
house
and
our
family
become
close
steve
be
never
intentionally
wound
to
him
most
people
in
steve
s
life
be
replaceable
but
not
jony
job
described
to
me
his
respect
for
ive
the
difference
that
jony
have
make
not
only
at
apple
but
in
the
world
be
huge
he
be
a
wickedly
intelligent
person
in
all
way
he
understands
business
concept
marketing
concept
he
pick
stuff
up
just
like
that
click
he
understands
what
we
do
at
our
core
well
than
anyone
if
i
have
a
spiritual
partner
at
apple
it
s
jony
jony
and
i
think
up
most
of
the
product
together
and
then
pull
others
in
and
say
hey
what
do
you
think
about
this
he
get
the
big
picture
as
well
as
the
most
infinitesimal
detail
about
each
product
and
he
understands
that
apple
be
a
product
company
he
s
not
just
a
designer
that
s
why
he
work
directly
for
me
he
have
more
operational
power
than
anyone
else
at
apple
except
me
there
s
no
one
who
can
tell
him
what
to
do
or
to
butt
out
that
s
the
way
i
set
it
up
like
most
designer
ive
enjoy
analyze
the
philosophy
and
the
step
by
step
think
that
go
into
a
particular
design
for
job
the
process
be
more
intuitive
he
would
point
to
model
and
sketch
he
like
and
dump
on
the
one
he
didn
t
ive
would
then
take
the
cue
and
develop
the
concept
job
bless
ive
be
a
fan
of
the
german
industrial
designer
dieter
ram
who
work
for
the
electronics
firm
braun
ram
preach
the
gospel
of
less
but
well
weniger
aber
besser
and
likewise
job
and
ive
wrestle
with
each
new
design
to
see
how
much
they
could
simplify
it
ever
since
apple
s
first
brochure
proclaim
simplicity
be
the
ultimate
sophistication
job
have
aim
for
the
simplicity
that
come
from
conquer
complexity
not
ignore
them
it
take
a
lot
of
hard
work
he
say
to
make
something
simple
to
truly
understand
the
underlie
challenge
and
come
up
with
elegant
solution
in
ive
job
met
his
soul
mate
in
the
quest
for
true
rather
than
surface
simplicity
sit
in
his
design
studio
ive
described
his
philosophy
why
do
we
assume
that
simple
be
good
because
with
physical
product
we
have
to
feel
we
can
dominate
them
as
you
bring
order
to
complexity
you
find
a
way
to
make
the
product
defer
to
you
simplicity
isn
t
just
a
visual
style
it
s
not
just
minimalism
or
the
absence
of
clutter
it
involves
dig
through
the
depth
of
the
complexity
to
be
truly
simple
you
have
to
go
really
deep
for
example
to
have
no
screw
on
something
you
can
end
up
have
a
product
that
be
so
convolute
and
so
complex
the
well
way
be
to
go
deeper
with
the
simplicity
to
understand
everything
about
it
and
how
it
s
manufacture
you
have
to
deeply
understand
the
essence
of
a
product
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
the
part
that
be
not
essential
that
be
the
fundamental
principle
job
and
ive
share
design
be
not
just
about
what
a
product
look
like
on
the
surface
it
have
to
reflect
the
product
s
essence
in
most
people
s
vocabulary
design
mean
veneer
job
told
fortune
shortly
after
retake
the
rein
at
apple
but
to
me
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
meaning
of
design
design
be
the
fundamental
soul
of
a
man
make
creation
that
end
up
express
itself
in
successive
outer
layer
as
a
result
the
process
of
design
a
product
at
apple
be
integrally
related
to
how
it
would
be
engineer
and
manufacture
ive
described
one
of
apple
s
power
mac
we
want
to
get
rid
of
anything
other
than
what
be
absolutely
essential
he
say
to
do
so
require
total
collaboration
between
the
designer
the
product
developer
the
engineer
and
the
manufacturing
team
we
kept
go
back
to
the
begin
again
and
again
do
we
need
that
part
can
we
get
it
to
perform
the
function
of
the
other
four
part
the
connection
between
the
design
of
a
product
its
essence
and
its
manufacturing
be
illustrate
for
job
and
ive
when
they
be
travel
in
france
and
go
into
a
kitchen
supply
store
ive
picked
up
a
knife
he
admire
but
then
put
it
down
in
disappointment
job
do
the
same
we
both
notice
a
tiny
bit
of
glue
between
the
handle
and
the
blade
ive
recall
they
talk
about
how
the
knife
s
good
design
have
be
ruin
by
the
way
it
be
manufacture
we
don
t
like
to
think
of
our
knife
as
be
glue
together
ive
say
steve
and
i
care
about
thing
like
that
which
ruin
the
purity
and
detract
from
the
essence
of
something
like
a
utensil
and
we
think
alike
about
how
product
should
be
make
to
look
pure
and
seamless
at
most
other
company
engineering
tends
to
drive
design
the
engineer
set
forth
their
specification
and
requirement
and
the
designer
then
come
up
with
case
and
shell
that
will
accommodate
them
for
job
the
process
tend
to
work
the
other
way
in
the
early
day
of
apple
job
have
approve
the
design
of
the
case
of
the
original
macintosh
and
the
engineer
have
to
make
their
board
and
component
fit
after
he
be
force
out
the
process
at
apple
revert
to
be
engineer
driven
before
steve
come
back
engineer
would
say
here
be
the
gut
processor
hard
drive
and
then
it
would
go
to
the
designer
to
put
it
in
a
box
say
apple
s
marketing
chief
phil
schiller
when
you
do
it
that
way
you
come
up
with
awful
product
but
when
job
return
and
forge
his
bond
with
ive
the
balance
be
again
tilt
toward
the
designer
steve
kept
impress
on
us
that
the
design
be
integral
to
what
would
make
us
great
say
schiller
design
once
again
dictate
the
engineering
not
just
vice
versa
on
occasion
this
could
backfire
such
as
when
job
and
ive
insist
on
use
a
solid
piece
of
brush
aluminum
for
the
edge
of
the
iphone
even
when
the
engineer
worried
that
it
would
compromise
the
antenna
but
usually
the
distinctiveness
of
its
design
for
the
imac
the
ipod
the
iphone
and
the
ipad
would
set
apple
apart
and
lead
to
its
triumph
in
the
year
after
job
return
inside
the
studio
the
design

where
jony

most
of
my

with
jony

for
this

be
held
elsewhere
but
one
day
in
he
arrange
for
me
to
spend
an
afternoon
tour
the

talk
about
how

with

the
cavernous
main

with
six
long
steel

for

and

in

fill
with
workstation
that
lead
to
a
room
with
mold
machine
to
turn
what
s
on
the
screen
into
foam
model
beyond
that
be
a
robot
control
spray
painting

to
make
the

the

in
the

almost
every
day
when
job
be
healthy
and
in
the
office
he
would
have
lunch
with
ive
and
then
wander
by
the
studio
in
the
afternoon
as
he
enter
he
could
survey
the
table
and
see
the
product
in
the
pipeline
sense
how
they
fit
into
apple
s
strategy
and
inspect
with
his
fingertip
the
evolve
design
of
each
usually
it
be
just
the
two
of
them
alone
while
the
other
designer
glance
up
from
their
work
but
kept
a
respectful
distance
if
job
have
a
specific
issue
he
might
call
over
the
head
of
mechanical
design
or
another
of
ive
s
deputy
if
something
excite
him
or
spark
some
thought
about
corporate
strategy
he
might
ask
the
chief
operating
officer
tim
cook
or
the
marketing
head
phil
schiller
to
come
over
and
join
them
ive
described
the
usual
process
this
great
room
be
the
one
place
in
the
company
where
you
can
look
around
and
see
everything
we
have
in
the
work
when
steve
come
in
he
will
sit
at
one
of
these
table
if
we
re
work
on
a
new
iphone
for
example
he
might
grab
a
stool
and
start
play
with
different
model
and
feel
them
in
his
hand
remark
on
which
one
he
like
best
then
he
will
graze
by
the
other
table
just
him
and
me
to
see
where
all
the
other
product
be
head
he
can
get
a
sense
of
the
sweep
of
the
whole
company
the
iphone
and
ipad
the
imac
and
laptop
and
everything
we
re
consider
that
help
him
see
where
the
company
be
spending
its
energy
and
how
thing
connect
and
he
can
ask
do
do
this
make
sense
because
over
here
be
where
we
be
grow
a
lot
or
question
like
that
he
get
to
see
thing
in
relationship
to
each
other
which
be
pretty
hard
to
do
in
a
big
company
look
at
the
model
on
these
table
he
can
see
the
future
for
the
next
three
year
much
of
the
design
process
be
a
conversation
a
back
and
forth
as
we
walk
around
the
table
and
play
with
the
model
he
doesn
t
like
to
read
complex
drawing
he
want
to
see
and
feel
a
model
he
s
right
i
get
surprised
when
we
make
a
model
and
then
realize
it
s
rubbish
even
though
base
on
the
cad
computer
aid
design
rendering
it
look
great
he
love
come
in
here
because
it
s
calm
and
gentle
it
s
a
paradise
if
you
re
a
visual
person
there
be
no
formal
design
review
so
there
be
no
huge
decision
point
instead
we
can
make
the
decision
fluid
since
we
iterate
every
day
and
never
have
dumb
as
presentation
we
don
t
run
into
major
disagreement
on
this
day
ive
be
oversee
the
creation
of
a
new
european
power
plug
and
connector
for
the
macintosh
dozen
of
foam
model
each
with
the
tiniest
variation
have
be
cast
and
paint
for
inspection
some
would
find
it
odd
that
the
head
of
design
would
fret
over
something
like
this
but
job
get
involve
as
well
ever
since
he
have
a
special
power
supply
make
for
the
apple
ii
job
have
care
about
not
only
the
engineering
but
also
the
design
of
such
part
his
name
be
list
on
the
patent
for
the
white
power
brick
use
by
the
macbook
as
well
as
its
magnetic
connector
with
its
satisfy
click
in
fact
he
be
list
as
one
of
the
inventor
for
different
apple
patent
in
the
united
state
as
of
the
begin
of
ive
and
job
have
even
obsess
over
and
patent
the
packaging
for
various
apple
product
u
s
patent

for
the
ipod

how
the

be
for
the
iphone
packaging
with
its
sturdy
lid
and
little
glossy
plastic
tray
inside
early
on
mike
markkula
have
taught
job
to
impute
to
understand
that
people
do
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
and
therefore
to
make
sure
all
the
trapping
and
packaging
of
apple
signal
that
there
be
a
beautiful
gem
inside
whether
it
s
an
ipod
mini
or
a
macbook
pro
apple
customer
know
the
feel
of
opening
up
the
well
craft
box
and
find
the
product
nestle
in
an
invite
fashion
steve
and
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
packaging
say
ive
i
love
the
process
of
unpack
something
you
design
a
ritual
of
unpack
to
make
the
product
feel
special
packaging
can
be
theater
it
can
create
a
story
ive
who
have
the
sensitive
temperament
of
an
artist
at
time
get
upset
with
job
for
take
too
much
credit
a
habit
that
have
bother
other
colleague
over
the
year
his
personal
feeling
for
job
be
so
intense
that
at
time
he
get
easily
bruise
he
will
go
through
a
process
of
look
at
my
idea
and
say
that
s
no
good
that
s
not
very
good
i
like
that
one
ive
say
and
later
i
will
be
sit
in
the
audience
and
he
will
be
talk
about
it
as
if
it
be
his
idea
i
pay
maniacal
attention
to
where
an
idea
come
from
and
i
even
keep
notebook
fill
with
my
idea
so
it
hurt
when
he
take
credit
for
one
of
my
design
ive
also
have
bristle
when
outsider
portrayed
job
as
the
only
idea
guy
at
apple
that
make
us
vulnerable
as
a
company
ive
say
earnestly
his
voice
soft
but
then
he
pause
to
recognize
the
role
job
in
fact
played
in
so
many
other
company
idea
and
great
design
get
lose
in
the
process
he
say
the
idea
that
come
from
me
and
my
team
would
have
be
completely
irrelevant
nowhere
if
steve
hadn
t
be
here
to
push
us
work
with
us
and
drive
through
all
the
resistance
to
turn
our
idea
into
product

hello
again
back
to
the

the
first
great

it
should
be
an
all
in

product
with
keyboard
and
monitor
and
computer
ready
to
use
right
out
of
the
box
it
should
have
a
distinctive
design
that
make
a
brand
statement
and
it
should
sell
for
or
so
apple
have
no
computer
sell
for
less
than
at
the
time
he
told
us
to
go
back
to
the
root
of
the
original
macintosh
an
all
in
one
consumer
appliance
recall
schiller
that
meant
design
and
engineering
have
to
work
together
the
initial
plan
be
to
build
a
network
computer
a
concept
champion
by
oracle
s
larry
ellison
which
be
an
inexpensive
terminal
without
a
hard
drive
that
would
mainly
be
use
to
connect
to
the
internet
and
other
network
but
apple
s
chief
financial
officer
fred
anderson
lead
the
push
to
make
the
product
more
robust
by
add
a
disk
drive
so
it
could
become
a
full
fledge

a

and
a

for
compact

but
in
a
rather
bold
move
job
and
rubinstein
decide
not
to
include
the

eventually
most

eliminate
floppy

ive
and
his
top
deputy
danny
coster
begin
to
sketch
out
futuristic
design
job
brusquely
reject
the
dozen
foam
model
they
initially
produce
but
ive
knew
how
to
guide
him
gently
ive
agree
that
none
of
them
be
quite
right
but
he
point
out
one
that
have
promise
it
be
curve
playful
look
and
do
not
seem
like
an
unmovable
slab
root
to
the
table
it
have
a
sense
that
it
s
just
arrive
on
your
desktop
or
it
s
just
about
to
hop
off
and
go
somewhere
he
told
job
by
the
next
show
ive
have
refine
the
playful
model
this
time
job
with
his
binary
view
of
the
world
rave
that
he
love
it
he
take
the
foam
prototype
and
begin
carry
it
around
the
headquarters
with
him
show
it
in
confidence
to
trust
lieutenant
and
board
member
in
its
ad
apple
be
celebrate
the
glory
of
be
able
to
think
different
yet
until
now
nothing
have
be
propose
that
be
much
different
from
exist
computer
finally
job
have
something
new
the
plastic
case
that
ive
and
coster
propose
be
sea
green
blue
later
name
bondi
blue
after
the
color
of
the
water
at
a
beach
in
australia
and
it
be
translucent
so
that
you
could
see
through
to
the
inside
of
the
machine
we
be
try
to
convey
a
sense
of
the
computer
be
changeable
base
on
your
need
to
be
like
a
chameleon
say
ive
that
s
why
we
like
the
translucency
you
could
have
color
but
it
felt
so
unstatic
and
it
come
across
as
cheeky
both
metaphorically
and
in
reality
the
translucency
connect
the
inner
engineering
of
the
computer
to
the
outer
design
job
have
always
insist
that
the
row
of
chip
on
the
circuit
board
look
neat
even
though
they
would
never
be
see
now
they
would
be
see
the
case
would
make
visible
the
care
that
have
go
into
make
all
component
of
the
computer
and
fitting
them
together
the
playful
design
would
convey
simplicity
while
also
reveal
the
depth
that
true
simplicity
entail
even
the
simplicity
of
the
plastic
shell
itself
involve
great
complexity
ive
and
his
team
work
with
apple
s
korean
manufacturer
to
perfect
the
process
of
make
the
case
and
they
even
go
to
a
jelly
bean
factory
to
study
how
to
make
translucent
color
look
entice
the
cost
of
each
case
be
more
than
per
unit
three
time
that
of
a
regular
computer
case
other
company
would
probably
have
demand
presentation
and
study
to
show
whether
the
translucent
case
would
increase
sale
enough
to
justify
the
extra
cost
job
ask
for
no
such
analysis
top
off
the
design
be
the
handle
nestle
into
the
imac
it
be
more
playful
and
semiotic
than
it
be
functional
this
be
a
desktop
computer
not
many
people
be
really
go
to
carry
it
around
but
as
ive
later
explain
back
then
people
weren
t
comfortable
with
technology
if
you
re
scar
of
something
then
you
won
t
touch
it
i
could
see
my
mum
be
scar
to
touch
it
so
i
thought
if
there
s
this
handle
on
it
it
make
a
relationship
possible
it
s
approachable
it
s
intuitive
it
give
you
permission
to
touch
it
give
a
sense
of
its
deference
to
you
unfortunately
manufacturing
a
recess
handle
cost
a
lot
of
money
at
the
old
apple
i
would
have
lose
the
argument
what
be
really
great
about
steve
be
that
he
saw
it
and
say
that
s
cool
i
didn
t
explain
all
the
think
but
he
intuitively
get
it
he
just
knew
that
it
be
part
of
the
imac
s
friendliness
and
playfulness
job
have
to
fend
off
the
objection
of
the
manufacturing
engineer
support
by
rubinstein
who
tend
to
raise
practical
cost
consideration
when
face
with
ive
s
aesthetic
desire
and
various
design
whim
when
we
take
it
to
the
engineer
job
say
they
come
up
with
thirty
eight
reason
they
couldn
t
do
it
and
i
say
no
no
we
re
do
this
and
they
say
well
why
and
i
say
because
i
m
the
ceo
and
i
think
it
can
be
do
and
so
they
kind
of
grudgingly
do
it
job
ask
lee
clow
and
ken
segall
and
others
from
the
tbwa
chiat
day
ad
team
to
fly
up
to
see
what
he
have
in
the
work
he
brought
them
into
the
guard
design
studio
and
dramatically
unveiled
ive
s
translucent
teardrop
shape
design
which
look
like
something
from
the
jetsons
the
animate
tv
show
set
in
the
future
for
a
moment
they
be
take
aback
we
be
pretty
shock
but
we
couldn
t
be
frank
segall
recall
we
be
really
think
jesus
do
they
know
what
they
be
do
it
be
so
radical
job
ask
them
to
suggest
name
segall
come
back
with
five
option
one
of
them
imac
job
didn
t
like
any
of
them
at
first
so
segall
come
up
with
another
list
a
week
later
but
he
say
that
the
agency
still
prefer
imac
job
reply
i
don
t
hate
it
this
week
but
i
still
don
t
like
it
he
try
silk
screen
it
on
some
of
the
prototype
and
the
name
grow
on
him
and
thus
it
become
the
imac
as
the
deadline
for
complete
the
imac
drew
near
job
s
legendary
temper
reappear
in
force
especially
when
he
be
confront
manufacturing
issue
at
one
product
review
meeting
he
learn
that
the
process
be
go
slowly
he
do
one
of
his
display
of
awesome
fury
and
the
fury
be
absolutely
pure
recall
ive
he
go
around
the
table
assail
everyone
start
with
rubinstein
you
know
we
re
try
to
save
the
company
here
he
shout
and
you
guy
be
screw
it
up
like
the
original
macintosh
team
the
imac
crew
stagger
to
completion
just
in
time
for
the
big
announcement
but
not
before
job
have
one
last
explosion
when
it
come
time
to
rehearse
for
the
launch
presentation
rubinstein
cobble
together
two
work
prototype
job
have
not
see
the
final
product
before
and
when
he
look
at
it
onstage
he
saw
a
button
on
the
front
under
the
display
he
push
it
and
the
cd
tray
open
what
the
fuck
be
this
he
ask
though
not
as
politely
none
of
us
say
anything
schiller
recall
because
he
obviously
knew
what
a
cd
tray
be
so
job
continued
to
rail
it
be
suppose
to
have
a
clean
cd
slot
he
insist
refer
to
the
elegant
slot
drive
that
be
already
to
be
found
in
upscale
car
steve
this
be
exactly
the
drive
i
show
you
when
we
talk
about
the
component
rubinstein
explain
no
there
be
never
a

just
a
slot
job
insist
rubinstein
didn
t
back
down
job
s
fury
didn
t
abate
i
almost
start
cry
because
it
be
too
late
to
do
anything
about
it
job
later
recall
they
suspend
the
rehearsal
and
for
a
while
it
seem
as
if
job
might
cancel
the
entire
product
launch
ruby
look
at
me
as
if
to
say
be
i
crazy
schiller
recall
it
be
my
first
product
launch
with
steve
and
the
first
time
i
saw
his
mind
set
of
if
it
s
not
right
we
re
not
launch
it
finally
they
agree
to
replace
the
tray
with
a
slot

for
the
next
version
of
the
imac
i
m
only

if
you
promise
we
re

problem
with
the
video
he
plan
to
show
in
it
jony
ive
be
show
describe
his
design
think
and
ask
what
computer
would
the
jetsons
have
have
it
be
like
the
future
yesterday
at
that
moment
there
be

him
to

that

later
on
a
steve

on
the
website
gawker
the
follow
tale
appear
from
someone
who
have
work
at
the
whole
food
store
in
palo
alto
a
few
block
from
job
s
home
i
be
shag
cart
one
afternoon
when
i
saw
this
silver
mercedes
park
in
a
handicapped
spot
steve
job
be
inside
scream
at
his
car
phone
this
be
right
before
the
first
imac
be
unveiled
and
i
m
pretty
sure
i
could
make
out
not
fuck
blue
enough
as
always
job
be
compulsive
in
prepare
for
the
dramatic
unveil
have
stop
one
rehearsal
because
he
be
angry
about
the
cd
drive
tray
he
stretch
out
the
other
rehearsal
to
make
sure
the
show
would
be
stellar
he
repeatedly
go
over
the
climactic
moment
when
he
would
walk
across
the
stage
and
proclaim
say
hello
to
the
new
imac
he
want
the
light
to
be
perfect
so
that
the
translucence
of
the
new
machine
would
be
vivid
but
after
a
few
run
throughs
he
be
still
unsatisfied
an
echo
of
his
obsession
with
stage
light
that
sculley
have
witness
at
the
rehearsal
for
the
original
macintosh
launch
he
order
the
light
to
be
brighter
and
come
on
earlier
but
that
still
didn
t
please
him
so
he
jogged
down
the
auditorium
aisle
and
slouch
into
a
center
seat
drape
his
leg
over
the
seat
in
front
let
s
keep
do
it
till
we
get
it
right
okay
he
say
they
make
another
attempt
no
no
job
complain
this
isn
t
work
at
all
the
next
time
the
light
be
bright
enough
but
they
come
on
too
late
i
m
get
tire
of
ask
about
this
job
growl
finally
the
imac
shone
just
right
oh
right
there
that
s
great
job
yell
a
year
earlier
job
have
oust
mike
markkula
his
early
mentor
and
partner
from
the
board
but
he
be
so
proud
of
what
he
have
wrought
with
the
new
imac
and
so
sentimental
about
its
connection
to
the
original
macintosh
that
he
invite
markkula
to
cupertino
for
a
private
preview
markkula
be
impressed
his
only
objection
be
to
the
new
mouse
that
ive
have
design
it
look
like
a
hockey
puck
markkula
say
and
people
would
hate
it
job
disagreed
but
markkula
be
right
otherwise
the
machine
have
turn
out
to
be
as
have
its
predecessor
insanely
great
the
launch
may
with
the
launch
of
the
original
macintosh
in
job
have
create
a
new
kind
of
theater
the
product
debut
as
an
epochal
event
climaxed
by
a
let
there
be
light
moment
in
which
the
sky
part
a
light
shine
down
the
angel
sing
and
a
chorus
of
the
chosen
faithful
sings
hallelujah
for
the
grand
unveil
of
the
product
that
he
hop
would
save
apple
and
again
transform
personal
compute
job
symbolically
chose
the
flint
auditorium
of
de
anza
community
college
in
cupertino
the
same
venue
he
have
use
in
he
would
be
pull
out
all
the
stop
in
order
to
dispel
doubt
rally
the
troop
enlist
support
in
the
developer
community
and
jump
start
the
marketing
of
the
new
machine
but
he
be
also
do
it
because
he
enjoy
play
impresario
put
on
a
great
show
pique
his
passion
in
the
same
way
as

out
a
great
product

his
sentimental
side
he
begin
with
a
graceful
shout
out
to
three
people
he
have
invite
to
be
up
front
in
the
audience
he

john

so
successful
year
ago
make
hit

and
promote
them
with
terrific
marketing
carp
be
heard
from
only
one
familiar
corner
as
the

assure
a
gathering
of
financial
analyst
visit
microsoft
that
this
would
be
a
passing
fad
the
one
thing
apple

provide
now
be
leadership
in

say
as
he
point
to
a

that
he
jokingly
have

won
t
take
long
for
us
to
catch
up
with
that
i
don
t

furious
and
he
told
a
reporter
that
gate
the
man
he
have
publicly
decry
for
be
completely
devoid
of
taste
be
clueless
about
what
make
the
imac
so
much
more
appeal
than
other
computer
the
thing
that
our
competitor
be
miss
be
that
they
think
it
s
about
fashion
and
they
think
it
s
about
surface
appearance
he
say
they
say
we
ll
slap
a
little
color
on
this
piece
of
junk
computer
and
we
ll
have
one
too
the
imac
go
on
sale
in
august
for
it
sell
unit
in
its
first
six
week
and
would
sell
by
the
end
of
the
year
make
it
the
fast
sell
computer
in
apple
history
most
notably
of
the
sale
go
to
people
who
be
buying
a
computer
for
the
first
time
and
another
to
people
who

ive
soon
come
up
with
four
new
juicy
look
color
in
addition
to
bondi
blue
for
the
imacs
offering
the
same
computer
in
five
color
would
of
course
create
huge
challenge
for
manufacturing
inventory
and
distribution
at
most
company
include
even
the
old
apple
there
would
have
be
study
and
meeting
to
look
at
the
cost
and
benefit
but
when
job
look
at
the
new
color
he
get
totally
psyched
and
summon
other
executive
over
to
the
design
studio
we
re
go
to
do
all
sort
of
color
he
told
them
excitedly
when
they
left
ive
look
at
his
team
in
amazement
in
most
place
that
decision
would
have
take
month
ive
recall
steve
do
it
in
a
half
hour
there
be
one
other
important
refinement
that
job
want
for
the
imac
get
rid
of
that
detest
cd
tray
i
d
see
a
slot
load
drive
on
a
very
high
end
sony
stereo
he
say
so
i
go
to
the
drive
manufacturer
and
get
them
to
do
a
slot
load
drive
for
us
for
the
version
of
the
imac
we
do
nine
month
later
rubinstein
try
to
argue
him
out
of
the
change
he
predict
that
new
drive
would
come
along
that
could
burn
music
onto
cd
rather
than
merely
play
them
and
they
would
be
available
in
tray
form
before
they
be
make
to
work
in
slot
if
you
go
to
slot
you
will
always
be
behind
on
the
technology
rubinstein
argue
i
don
t
care
that
s
what
i
want
job
snap
back
they
be
have
lunch
at
a
sushi
bar
in
san
francisco
and
job
insist
that
they
continue
the
conversation
over
a
walk
i
want
you
to
do
the
slot
load
drive
for
me
as
a
personal
favor
job
ask
rubinstein
agree
of
course
but
he
turn
out
to
be
right
panasonic
come
out
with
a
cd
drive
that
could
rip
and
burn
music
and
it
be
available
first
for
computer
that
have
old
fashion
tray
loader
the
effect
of
this
would
ripple
over
the
next
few
year
it
would
cause
apple
to
be
slow
in
catering
to
user
who
want
to
rip
and
burn
their
own
music
but
that
would
then
force
apple
to
be
imaginative
and
bold
in
find
a
way
to
leapfrog
over
its
competitor
when
job
finally
realize
that
he
have
to
get
into
the
music
market
chapter
twenty
eight
ceo
still
crazy
after
all
these
year
tim
cook
and
job
tim
cook
when
steve
job
return
to
apple
and
produce
the
think
different
ad
and
the
imac
in
his
first
year
it
confirm
what
most
people
already
knew
that
he
could
be
creative
and
a
visionary
he
have
show
that
during
his
first
round
at
apple
what
be
less
clear
be
whether
he
could
run
a
company
he
have
definitely
not
show
that
during
his
first
round
job
threw
himself
into
the
task
with
a
detail
orient
realism
that
astonish
those
who
be
use
to
his
fantasy
that
the
rule
of
this
universe
need
not
apply
to
him
he
become
a
manager
which
be
different
from
be
an
executive
or
visionary
and
that
pleasantly
surprised
me
recall
ed
woolard
the
board
chair
who
lure
him
back
his
management
mantra
be
focus
he
eliminate
excess
product
line
and
cut
extraneous
feature
in
the
new
operating
system
software
that
apple
be
develop
he
let
go
of
his
control
freak
desire
to
manufacture
product
in
his
own
factory
and
instead
outsource
the
make
of
everything
from
the
circuit
board
to
the
finish
computer
and
he
enforce
on
apple
s
supplier
a
rigorous
discipline
when
he
take
over
apple
have
more
than
two
month
worth
of
inventory
sit
in
warehouse
more
than
any
other
tech
company
like
egg
and
milk
computer
have
a
short
shelf
life
so
this
amount
to
at
least
a
million
hit
to
profit
by
early
he
have
halve
that
to
a
month
job
s
success
come
at
a
cost
since
velvety
diplomacy
be
still
not
part
of
his
repertoire
when
he
decide
that
a
division
of
airborne
express
wasn
t
deliver
spare
part
quickly
enough
he
order
an
apple
manager
to
break
the
contract
when
the
manager
protest
that
do
so
could
lead
to
a
lawsuit
job
reply
just
tell
them
if
they
fuck
with
us
they
ll
never
get
another
fuck
dime
from
this
company
ever
the
manager
quit
there
be
a
lawsuit
and
it
take
a
year
to
resolve
my
stock
option
would
be
worth
million
have
i
stayed
the
manager
say
but
i
knew
i
couldn
t
have
stood
it
and
he
d
have
fire
me
anyway
the
new
distributor
be
order
to
cut
inventory
and
do
under
steve
job
there
s
zero
tolerance
for
not
perform
its

when
vlsi

job
storm
into
a
meeting
and
start
shout
that
they
be

dickless
asshole
the
company
end
up
get
the
chip
to
apple
on
time
and
its
executive
make
jacket
that
boast
on
the
back
team
fda
after
three
month
of
work
under
job
apple
s
head
of
operation
decide
he
could
not
bear
the
pressure
and
he
quit
for
almost
a
year
job
ran
operation
himself
because
all
the
prospect
he
interviewed
seem
like
they
be
old
wave
manufacturing
people
he
recall
he
want
someone
who
could
build
just
in
time
factory
and
supply
chain
as
michael
dell
have
do
then
in
he
met

cook
a
courtly
thirty
seven
year
old
procurement
and
supply
chain
manager
at
compaq
computer
who
not
only
would
become
his
operation
manager
but
would
grow
into
an
indispensable
backstage
partner
in
run
apple
as
job
recall
tim
cook
come
out
of
procurement
which
be
just
the
right
background
for
what
we
need
i
realize
that
he
and
i
saw
thing
exactly
the
same
way
i
have
visit
a
lot
of
just
in
time
factory
in
japan
and
i
d
built
one
for
the
mac
and
at
next
i
knew
what
i
want
and
i
met
tim
and
he
want
the
same
thing
so
we
start
to
work
together
and
before
long
i
trust
him
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
he
have
the
same
vision
i
do
and
we
could
interact
at
a
high
strategic
level
and
i
could
just
forget
about
a
lot
of
thing
unless
he
come
and
ping
me

him
he
have
recently
take
a
job
at
compaq
he
have
always
be
a
very
logical
engineer
and
compaq
then
seem
a
more
sensible
career
option
but
he
be
snare
by
job

aura
five
minute
into
my
initial
interview
with
steve
i
want
to
throw
caution
and
logic
to
the
wind
and
join

he
later
say
my
intuition
told
me
that
join
apple
would
be
a
once
in
a
lifetime
opportunity
to
work
for
a
creative
genius
and
so
he
do
engineer
be
taught
to
make
a
decision
analytically
but
there
be
time
when

late
component
available
mock
turtleneck
and
teamwork
on
a
trip
to
japan
in
the
early
s
job
ask
sony
s
chairman
akio
morita
why
everyone
in
his
company
s
factory
wore
uniform
he
look
very
ashamed
and
told
me
that
after
the
war
no
one
have
any
clothes
and
company
like
sony
have
to
give
their
worker
something
to
wear
each
day
job
recall
over
the
year
the
uniform
developed
their
own
signature
style
especially
at
company
such
as
sony
and
it
become
a
way
of
bonding
worker
to
the
company
i
decide
that
i
want
that
type
of
bonding
for
apple
job
recall
sony
with
its
appreciation
for
style
have
gotten
the
famous
designer
issey
miyake
to
create
one
of
its
uniform
it
be
a
jacket
make
of
ripstop
nylon
with
sleeve
that
could
unzip
to
make
it
a
vest
so
i
call
issey
and
ask
him
to
design
a
vest
for
apple
job
recall
i
come
back
with
some
sample
and
told
everyone
it
would
be
great
if
we
would
all
wear
these
vest
oh
man
do
i
get
booed
off
the
stage
everybody
hat
the
idea
in
the
process
however
he
become
friend
with
miyake
and
would
visit
him
regularly
he
also
come
to
like
the
idea
of
have
a
uniform
for
himself
because
of
both
its
daily
convenience
the
rationale
he
claimed
and
its
ability
to
convey
a
signature
style
so
i
ask
issey
to
make
me
some
of
his
black
turtleneck
that
i
like
and
he
make
me
like
a
hundred
of
them
job
notice
my
surprise
when
he
told
this
story
so
he
gesture
to
them
stack
up
in
the
closet
that
s
what
i
wear
he
say
i
have
enough
to
last
for
the
rest
of
my
life
despite
his
autocratic
nature
he
never
worship
at
the
altar
of
consensus
job
work
hard
to
foster
a
culture
of
collaboration
at
apple
many
company
pride
themselves
on
have
few
meeting
job
have
many
an
executive
staff
session
every
monday
a
marketing
strategy
session
all
wednesday
afternoon
and
endless
product
review
session
still
allergic
to
powerpoints
and
formal
presentation
he
insist
that
the
people
around
the
table
hash
out
issue
from
various
vantage
and
the
perspective
of
different
department
because
he
believe
that
apple
s
great
advantage
be
its
integration
of
the
whole
widget
from
design
to
hardware
to
software
to
content
he
want
all
department
at
the
company
to
work
together
in
parallel
the
phrase
he
use
be
deep
collaboration
and
concurrent
engineering
instead
of
a
development
process
in
which
a
product
would
be
pass
sequentially
from
engineering
to
design
to
manufacturing
to
marketing
and
distribution
these
various
department
collaborate
simultaneously
our
method
be
to
develop
integrate
product
and
that
meant
our
process
have
to
be
integrate
and
collaborative
job
say
this
approach
also
apply
to
key
hire
he
would
have
candidate
meet
the
top
leader
cook
tevanian
schiller
rubinstein
ive
rather
than
just
the
manager
of
the
department
where
they
want
to
work
then
we
all
get
together
without
the
person
and
talk
about
whether
they
ll
fit
in
job
say
his
goal
be
to
be
vigilant
against
the
bozo
explosion
that
lead
to
a
company
s
be
lard
with
second
rate
talent
for
most
thing
in
life
the
range
between
best
and
average
be
or
so
the
best
airplane
flight
the
best
meal
they
may
be
well
than
your
average
one
what
i
saw
with
woz
be
somebody
who
be
fifty
time
well
than
the
average
engineer
he
could
have
meeting
in
his
head
the
mac
team
be
an
attempt
to
build
a
whole
team
like
that
a
player
people
say
they
wouldn
t
get
along
they
d
hate
work
with
each
other
but
i
realize
that
a
player
like
to
work
with
a
player
they
just
didn
t
like
work
with
c
player
at
pixar
it
be
a
whole
company
of
a
player
when
i
get
back
to
apple
that
s
what
i
decide
to
try
to
do
you
need
to
have
a
collaborative
hire
process
when
we
hire
someone
even
if
they
re
go
to
be
in
marketing
i
will
have
them
talk
to
the
design
folk
and
the
engineer
my
role
model
be
j
robert
oppenheimer
i
read
about
the
type
of
people
he
sought
for
the
atom
bomb
project
i
wasn
t
nearly
as
good
as
he
be
but
that
s
what
i
aspire
to
do
the
process
could
be
intimidate
but
job
have
an
eye
for
talent
when
they
be
look
for
people
to
design
the
graphical
interface
for
apple
s
new
operating
system
job
get
an
email
from
a
young
man
and
invite
him
in
the
applicant
be
nervous
and
the
meeting
do
not
go
well
later
that
day
job
bumped
into
him
deject
sit
in
the
lobby
the
guy
ask
if
he
could
just
show
him
one
of
his
idea
so
job
look
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
a
little
demo
use
adobe
director
of
a
way
to
fit
more
icon
in
the
dock
at
the
bottom
of
a
screen
when
the
guy
move
the
cursor
over
the
icon
crammed
into
the
dock
the
cursor
mimicked
a
magnify
glass
and
make
each
icon
balloon
big
i
say
my
god
and
hire
him
on
the
spot
job
recall
the
feature
become
a
lovable
part
of
mac
osx
and
the
designer
go
on
to
design
such
thing
as
inertial
scroll
for
multi
touch
screen
the
delightful
feature
that
make
the
screen
keep
glide
for
a
moment
after
you
ve
finish
swipe
job
s
experience
at
next
have
mature
him
but
they
have
not
mellow
him
much
he
still
have
no
license
plate
on
his
mercedes
and
he
still
park
in
the
handicapped
space
next
to
the
front
door
sometimes
straddle
two
slot
it
become
a
run
gag
employee
make
sign
say
park
different
and
someone
paint
over
the
handicapped
wheelchair
symbol
with
a
mercedes
logo
people
be
allow
even
encourage
to
challenge
him
and
sometimes
he
would
respect
them
for
it
but
you
have
to
be
prepared
for
him
to
attack
you
even
bite
your
head
off
as
he
process
your
idea
you
never
win
an
argument
with
him
at
the
time
but
sometimes
you
eventually
win
say
james
vincent
the
creative
young
adman
who
work
with
lee
clow
you
propose
something
and
he
declares
that
s
a
stupid
idea
and
later
he
come
back
and
say
here
s
what
we
re
go
to
do
and
you
want
to
say
that
s
what
i
told
you
two
week
ago
and
you
say
that
s
a
stupid
idea
but
you
can
t
do
that
instead
you
say
that
s
a
great
idea
let
s
do
that
people
also
have
to
put
up
with
job
s
occasional
irrational
or
incorrect
assertion
to
both
family
and
colleague
he
be
apt
to
declare
with
great
conviction
some
scientific
or
historical
fact
that
have
scant
relationship
to
reality
there
can
be
something
he
know
absolutely
nothing
about
and
because
of
his
crazy
style
and
utter
conviction
he
can
convince
people
that
he
know
what
he
s
talk
about
say
ive
who
described
the
trait
as
weirdly
endear
yet
with
his
eye
for
detail
job
sometimes
correctly
pounce
on
tiny
thing
others
have
miss
lee
clow
recall
show
job
a
cut
of
a
commercial
make
some
minor
change
he
request
and
then
be
assault
with
a
tirade
about
how
the
ad
have
be
completely
destroyed
he
discover
we
have
cut
two
extra
frame
something
so
fleeting
it
be
nearly
impossible
to
notice
say
clow
but
he
want
to
be
sure
that
an
image
hit
at
the
exact
moment
as
a
beat
of
the
music
and
he
be
totally
right
from
iceo
to
ceo
ed
woolard
his
mentor
on
the
apple
board
press
job
for
more
than
two
year
to
drop
the
interim
in
front
of
his
ceo
title
not
only
be
job
refuse
to
commit
himself
but
he
be
baffling
everyone
by
take
only
a
year
in
pay
and
no
stock
option
i
make
cent
for
show
up
he
like
to
joke
and
the
other
cent
be
base
on
performance
since
his
return
in
july
apple
stock
have
go
from
just
under
to
just
over
at
the
peak
of
the
internet
bubble
at
the
begin
of
woolard
have
beg
him
to
take
at
least
a
modest
stock
grant
back
in
but
job
have
decline
say
i
don
t
want
the
people
i
work
with
at
apple
to
think
i
be
come
back
to
get
rich
have
he
accepted
that
modest
grant
it
would
have
be
worth
million
instead
he
make
during
that
period
the
main
reason
he
clung
to
his
interim
designation
be
a
sense
of
uncertainty
about
apple
s
future
but
as
approach
it
be
clear
that
apple
have
rebound
and
it
be
because
of
him
he
take
a
long
walk
with
laurene
and
discuss
what
to
most
people
by
now
seem
a
formality
but
to
him
be
still
a
big
deal
if
he
drop
the
interim
designation
apple
could
be
the
base
for
all
the
thing
he
envision
include
the
possibility
of
get
apple
into
product
beyond
computer
he
decide
to
do
so
woolard
be
thrill
and
he
suggest
that
the
board
be
willing
to
give
him
a
massive
stock
grant
let
me
be
straight
with
you
job
reply
what
i
d
rather
have
be
an
airplane
we
just
have
a
third
kid
i
don
t
like
fly
commercial
i
like

take
my
family
to
hawaii
when
i
go
east
i
d
like
to
have
pilot
i
know
he
be
never
the
type
of
person
who
could
display
grace
and
patience
in
a
commercial
airplane
or
terminal
even
before
the
day
of
the
tsa
board
member
larry
ellison
whose
plane
job
sometimes
use
apple
paid
to
ellison
in
for
job
s
use
of
it
have
no
qualm
give
what
he
s
accomplish
we
should
give
him
five
airplane
ellison
argue
he
later
say
it
be
the
perfect
thank
you
gift
for
steve
who
have
save
apple
and
gotten
nothing
in
return
so
woolard
happily
grant
job
s
wish
with
a
gulfstream
v
and
also
offer
him
fourteen
million
stock
option
job
give
an
unexpected
response
he
want
more
twenty
million
option
woolard
be
baffle
and
upset
the
board
have
authority
from
the
stockholder
to
give
out
only
fourteen
million
you
say
you
didn
t
want
any

plane
which
you
do
want
woolard
say
i
hadn
t
be
insist
on
option
before
job
reply
but
you
suggest
it
could
be
up
to
of
the
company
in
option
and
that
s
what
i
now
want
it
be
an
awkward
tiff
in
what
should
have
be
a
celebratory
period
in
the
end
a
complex
solution
be
work
out
that
grant
him
ten
million
share
in
january
that
be
value
at
the
current
price
but
time

due
in
make
matter
bad
the
stock
fell
with
the
burst
of
the
internet
bubble
job
never
exercise
the
option
and
at
the
end
of
he
ask
that
they
be
replace
by
a
new
grant
with
a
low
strike
price
the
wrestling
over
option
would
come
back
to
haunt
the
company
even
if
he
didn
t
profit
from
the
option
at
least
he
get
to
enjoy
the
airplane
not
surprisingly
he
fret
over
how
the
interior
would
be
design
it
take
him
more
than
a
year
he
use
ellison
s
plane
as
a
start
point
and
hire
his
designer
pretty
soon
he
be
drive
her
crazy
for
example
ellison
s
have
a
door
between
cabin
with
an
open
button
and
a
close
button
job
insist
that
his
have
a
single
button
that
toggle
he
didn
t
like
the
polished
stainless
steel
of
the
button
so
he
have
them
replace
with
brush
metal
one
but
in
the
end
he
get
the
plane
he
want
and
he
love
it
i
look
at
his
airplane
and
mine
and
everything
he
change
be
well
say
ellison
at
the
january
macworld
in
san
francisco
job
roll
out
the
new
macintosh
operating
system
osx
which
use
some
of
the
software
that
apple
have
bought
from
next
three
year
earlier
it
be
fitting
and
not
entirely
coincidental
that
he
be
willing
to
incorporate
himself
back
at
apple
at
the
same
moment
as
the
next
o
be
incorporate
into
apple
s
avie
tevanian
have
take
the
unix
related
mach
kernel
of
the
next
operating
system
and
turn
it
into
the
mac
o
kernel
know
as
darwin
it
offer
protect
memory
advanced
networking
and
preemptive
multitasking
it
be
precisely
what
the
macintosh
need
and
it
would
be
the
foundation
of
the
mac
o
henceforth
some
critic
include
bill
gate
note
that
apple
end
up
not
adopt
the
entire
next
operating
system
there
s
some
truth
to
that
because
apple
decide
not
to
leap
into
a
completely
new
system
but
instead
to
evolve
the
exist
one
application
software
write
for
the
old
macintosh
system
be
generally
compatible
with
or
easy
to
port
to
the
new
one
and
a
mac
user
who
upgraded
would
notice
a
lot
of
new
feature
but
not
a
whole
new
interface
the
fan
at
macworld
receive
the
news
with
enthusiasm
of
course
and
they
especially
cheer
when
job

off
the
dock
and
how
the
icon
in
it
could
be
magnify
by
passing
the
cursor
over
them
but
the
big
applause
come
for
the
announcement
he
reserve
for
his
oh
and
one
more
thing
coda
he
spoke
about
his
duty
at
both
pixar
and
apple
and
say
that
he
have
become
comfortable
that
the

i

pleased
to

today
that
i

with
a
big

part

of
apple
retail

one
of
the

a

for

the
boyish
enthusiasm
of
a
natural
born

ron

the

distinctive

product
such
as
a
teakettle
design
by
michael
graf
steve
be
very
easy
to
talk
to
say
johnson
in
recall
their
first
meeting
all
of
a
sudden
there
s
a
torn
pair
of
jean
and
turtleneck
and
he
s
off
and
run
about
why
he
need
great
store
if
apple
be
go
to
succeed
he
told
me
we
re
go
to
win
on
innovation
and
you
can
t
win
on
innovation
unless
you
have
a
way
to
communicate
to
customer
when
johnson
come
back
in
january
to
be
interviewed
again
job
suggest
that
they
take
a
walk
they
go
to
the
sprawl
store
stanford
shopping
mall
at
a
m
the
store
weren
t
open
yet
so
they
walk
up
and
down
the
entire
mall
repeatedly
and
discuss
how
it
be
organize
what
role
the
big
department
store
played
relative
to
the
other
store
and
why
certain
specialty
shop
be
successful
they
be
still
walk
and
talk
when
the
store
open
at
and
they
go
into
eddie
bauer
it
have
an
entrance
off
the
mall
and
another
off
the
parking
lot
job
decide
that
apple
store
should
have
only
one
entrance
which
would
make
it
easy
to
control
the
experience
and
the
eddie
bauer
store
they
agree
be
too
long
and
narrow
it
be
important
that
customer
intuitively
grasp
the
layout
of
a
store
as
soon
as
they
enter
there
be
no
tech
store
in
the
mall
and
johnson
explain
why
the
conventional
wisdom
be
that
a
consumer
when
make
a
major
and
infrequent
purchase
such
as
a
computer
would
be
willing
to
drive
to
a
less
convenient
location
where
the
rent
would
be
cheaper
job
disagreed
apple
store
should
be
in
mall
and
on
main
street
in
area
with
a
lot
of
foot
traffic
no
matter
how
expensive
we
may
not
be
able
to
get
them
to
drive
ten
mile
to
check
out
our
product
but
we
can
get
them
to
walk
ten
foot
he
say
the
window
user
in
particular
have
to
be
ambush
if
they
re
passing
by
they
will
drop
in
out
of
curiosity
if
we
make
it
invite
enough
and
once
we
get
a
chance
to
show
them
what
we
have
we
will
win
johnson
say
that
the
size
of
a
store
signal
the
importance
of
the
brand
be
apple
as
big
of
a
brand
as
the
gap
he
ask
job
say
it
be
much
big
johnson
reply
that
its
store
should
therefore
be
big
otherwise
you
won
t
be
relevant
job
described
mike
markkula
s
maxim
that
a
good
company
must
impute
it
must
convey
its
value
and
importance
in
everything
it
do
from
packaging
to
marketing
johnson
love
it
it
definitely
apply
to
a
company
s
store
the
store
will
become
the
most
powerful
physical
expression
of
the
brand
he
predict
he
say
that
when
he
be
young
he
have
go
to
the
wood
panel
art
fill
mansion
like
store
that
ralph
lauren
have
create
at
seventy
second
and
madison
in
manhattan
whenever
i
buy
a
polo
shirt
i
think
of
that
mansion
which
be
a
physical
expression
of
ralph
s
ideal
johnson
say
mickey
drexler
do
that
with
the
gap
you
couldn
t
think
of
a
gap
product
without
think
of
the
great
gap
store
with
the
clean
space
and
wood
floor
and
white
wall
and
fold
merchandise
when
they
finish
they
drove
to
apple
and
sat
in
a
conference
room
play
with
the
company
s
product
there
weren
t
many
not
enough
to
fill
the
shelf
of
a
conventional
store
but
that
be
an
advantage
the
type
of
store
they
would
build
they
decide
would
benefit
from
have
few
product
it
would
be
minimalist
and
airy
and
offer
a
lot
of
place
for
people
to
try
out
thing
most
people
don
t
know
apple
product
johnson
say
they
think
of
apple
as
a
cult
you
want
to
move
from
a
cult
to
something
cool
and
have
an
awesome
store
where
people
can
try
thing
will
help
that
the
store
would
impute
the
ethos
of
apple
product
playful
easy
creative
and
on
the
bright
side
of
the
line
between
hip
and
intimidate
the
prototype
when
job
finally
present
the
idea
the
board
be
not
thrill
gateway
computer
be
go
down
in
flame
after
opening
suburban
store
and
job
s
argument
that
his
would
do
well
because
they
would
be
in
more
expensive
location
be
not
on
its
face
reassure
think
different
and
here
s
to
the
crazy
one
make
for
good
advertising
slogan
but
the
board
be
hesitant
to
make
them
guideline
for
corporate
strategy
i
m
scratch
my
head
and
think
this
be
crazy
recall
art
levinson
the
ceo
of
genentech
who
join
the
apple
board
in
we
be
a
small
company
a
marginal
player
i
say
that
i
m
not
sure
i
can
support
something
like
this
ed
woolard
be
also
dubious
gateway
have
try
this
and
fail
while
dell
be
sell
direct
to
consumer
without
store
and
succeed
he
argue
job
be
not
appreciative
of
too
much
pushback
from
the
board
the
last
time
that
happen
he
have
replace
most
of
the
member
this
time
for
personal
reason
as
well
as
be
tire
of
play
tug
of
war
with
job
woolard
decide
to
step
down
but
before
he
do
the
board
approve
a
trial
run
of
four
apple
store
job
do
have
one
supporter
on
the
board
in
he
have
recruit
the
bronx
born
retailing
prince
millard
mickey
drexler
who
as
ceo
of
gap
have
transform
a
sleepy
chain
into
an
icon
of
american
casual
culture
he
be
one
of
the
few
people
in
the
world
who
be
as
successful
and
savvy
as
job
on
matter
of
design
image
and
consumer
yearning
in
addition
he
have
insist
on
end
to
end
control
gap
store
sell
only
gap
product
and
gap
product
be
sell
almost
exclusively
in
gap
store
i
left
the
department
store
business
because
i
couldn
t
stand
not
control
my
own
product
from
how
it
s
manufacture
to
how
it
s
sell
drexler
say
steve
be
just
that
way
which
be
why
i
think
he
recruit
me
drexler
give
job
a
piece
of
advice
secretly
build
a
prototype
of
the
store
near
the
apple
campus
furnish
it
completely
and
then
hang
out
there
until
you
feel
comfortable
with
it
so

all
morning
brainstorming
session
there
refining
their
retailing
philosophy
as
they
walk
the
space
it
be
the
store
equivalent
of
ive
s
design
studio
a
haven
where
job
with
his
visual
approach
could
come
up
with

by
touch
and
see
the
option

they
evolve
i

hand
over
the
credit
card
or
printing
a
receipt
if
you
look
at
the
store
and
the
product
you
will
see
steve
s
obsession
with
beauty
as
simplicity
this
bauhaus
aesthetic
and
wonderful
minimalism
which
go
all
the
way
to
the
checkout
process
in
the
store
say
ellison
it
mean
the
absolute
minimum
number
of
step
steve
give
us
the
exact
explicit
recipe
for
how
he
want
the
checkout
to
work
when
drexler
come
to
see
the
prototype
he
have
some
criticism
i
thought
the
space
be
too
chopped
up
and
not
clean
enough
there
be
too
many
distract
architectural
feature
and
color
he
emphasize
that
a
customer
should
be
able
to
walk
into
a
retail
space
and
with
one
sweep
of
the
eye
understand
the
flow
job
agree
that
simplicity
and
lack
of
distraction
be
key
to
a
great
store
as
they
be
to
a
product
after
that
he
nail
it
say
drexler
the
vision
he
have
be
complete
control
of
the
entire
experience
of
his
product
from
how
it
be
design
and
make
to
how
it
be
sell
in
october
near
what
he
thought
be
the
end
of
the
process
johnson
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
a
night
before
one
of
the
tuesday
meeting
with
a
painful
thought
they
have
gotten
something
fundamentally
wrong
they
be
organize
the
store
around
each
of
apple
s
main
product
line
with
area
for
the
powermac
imac
ibook
and
powerbook
but
job
have
begin
develop
a
new
concept
the
computer
as
a
hub
for
all
your
digital
activity
in
other
word
your
computer
might
handle
video
and
picture
from
your
camera
and
perhaps
someday
your
music
player
and
song
or
your
book
and
magazine
johnson
s
predawn
brainstorm
be
that
the
store
should
organize
display
not
just
around
the
company
s
four
line
of
computer
but
also
around
thing
people
might
want
to
do
for
example
i
thought
there
should
be
a
movie
bay
where
we
d
have
various
mac
and
powerbooks
run
imovie
and
show
how
you
can
import
from
your
video
camera
and
edit
johnson
arrive
at
job
s
office
early
that
tuesday
and
told
him
about
his
sudden
insight
that
they
need
to
reconfigure
the
store
he
have
heard
tale
of
his
bos
s
intemperate
tongue
but
he
have
not
yet
felt
its
lash
until
now
job
erupt
do
you
know
what
a
big
change
this
be
he
yell
i
ve
work
my
as
off
on
this
store
for
six
month
and
now
you
want
to
change
everything
job
suddenly
get
quiet
i
m
tire
i
don
t
know
if
i
can
design
another
store
from
scratch
johnson
be
speechless
and
job
make
sure
he
remain
so
on
the
ride
to
the
prototype
store
where
people
have
gather
for
the
tuesday
meeting
he
told
johnson
not
to
say
a
word
either
to
him
or
to
the
other
member
of
the
team
so
the
seven
minute
drive
proceed
in
silence
when
they
arrive
job
have
finish
processing
the
information
i
knew
ron
be
right
he
recall
so
to
johnson
s
surprise
job
open
the
meeting
by
say
ron
think
we
ve
get
it
all
wrong
he
think
it
should
be
organize
not
around
product
but
instead
around
what
people
do
there
be
a
pause
then
job
continued
and
you
know
he
s
right
he
say
they
would
redo
the
layout
even
though
it
would
likely
delay
the
plan
january
rollout
by
three
or
four
month
we
ve
only
get
one
chance
to
get
it
right
job
like
to
tell
the
story
and
he
do
so
to
his
team
that
day
about
how
everything
that
he
have
do
correctly
have
require
a
moment
when
he
hit
the
rewind
button
in
each
case
he
have
to
rework
something
that
he
discover
be
not
perfect
he
talk
about
do
it
on
toy
story
when
the
character
of
woody
have
evolve
into
be
a
jerk
and
on
a
couple
of
occasion
with
the
original
macintosh
if
something
isn
t
right
you
can
t
just
ignore
it
and
say
you
ll
fix
it
later
he
say
that
s
what
other
company
do
when
the
revise
prototype
be
finally
complete
in
january
job
allow
the
board
to
see
it
for
the
first
time
he
explain
the
theory
behind
the
design
by
sketch
on
a
whiteboard
then
he
load
board
member
into
a
van
for
the
two
mile
trip
when
they
saw
what
job
and
johnson
have
built
they
unanimously
approve
go
ahead
it
would
the
board
agree
take
the
relationship
between
retailing
and
brand
image
to
a
new
level
it
would
also
ensure
that
consumer
do
not
see
apple
computer
as
merely
a
commodity
product
like
dell
or
compaq
most

in
one
of
our
marketing
meeting
just
as
the
store
be
opening
steve
make
us
spend
a
half
hour
decide
what
hue
of
gray
the
restroom
sign
should
be
the
architectural
firm
of
bohlin
cywinski
jackson
design
the
signature
store
but
job
make
all
of
the
major
decision
job
particularly
focus
on
the
staircase
which
echoed
the
one
he
have
built
at
next
when
he
visit
a
store
as
it
be
be
construct
he
invariably
suggest
change
to
the
staircase
his
name
be
list
as
the
lead
inventor
on
two
patent
application
on
the
staircase
one
for
the
see
through
look
that
feature
all
glass
tread
and
glass
support
meld
together
with
titanium
the
other
for
the
engineering
system
that
us
a
monolithic
unit
of
glass
contain
multiple
glass
sheet
laminate
together
for
support
load
in
as
he
be
be
oust
from
his
first
tour
at
apple
he
have
visit
italy
and
be
impressed
by
the
gray
stone
of
florence
s
sidewalk
in
when
he
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
light
wood
floor
in
the
store
be
begin
to
look
somewhat
pedestrian
a
concern
that
it
s
hard
to
imagine
bedeviling
someone
like
microsoft
ceo
steve
ballmer
job
want
to
use
that
stone
instead
some
of
his
colleague
push
to
replicate
the
color
and
texture
use
concrete
which
would
have
be
ten
time
cheaper
but
job
insist
that
it
have
to
be
authentic
the
gray
blue
pietra
serena
sandstone
which
have
a
fine
grain
texture
come
from
a
family
own
quarry
il
casone
in
firenzuola
outside
of
florence
we
select
only
of
what
come
out
of
the
mountain
because
it
have
to
have
the
right
shade
and
vein
and
purity
say
johnson
steve
felt
very
strongly
that
we
have
to
get
the
color
right
and
it
have
to
be
a
material
with
high
integrity
so
designer
in
florence
picked
out
just
the
right
quarry
stone
oversaw
cut
it
into
the
proper
tile
and
make
sure
each
tile
be
marked
with
a
sticker
to
ensure
that
it
be
laid
out
next
to
its
companion
tile
know
that
it
s
the
same
stone
that
florence
us
for
its
sidewalk
assures
you
that
it
can
stand
the
test
of
time
say
johnson
another
notable
feature
of
the
store
be
the
genius
bar
johnson
come
up
with
the
idea
on
a
two
day
retreat
with
his
team
he
have
ask
them
all
to
describe
the
best
service
they
d
ever
enjoy
almost
everyone
mention
some
nice
experience
at
a
four
season
or
ritz
carlton
hotel
so
johnson
sent
his
first
five
store
manager
through
the
ritz
carlton
training
program
and
come
up
with
the
idea
of
replicate
something
between
a
concierge
desk
and
a
bar
what
if
we
staffed
the
bar
with
the
smartest
mac
people
he
say
to
job
we
could
call
it
the
genius
bar
job
call
the
idea
crazy
he
even
object
to
the
name
you
can
t
call
them
genius
he
say
they
re
geek
they
don
t
have
the
people
skill
to
deliver
on
something
call
the
genius
bar
johnson
thought
he
have
lose
but
the
next
day
he
ran
into
apple
s
general
counsel
who
say
by
the
way
steve
just
told
me
to
trademark
the

many
of

my
first

gary
allen
who
start
a
website
that
caters
to
apple

fan
he
and
i
have
do
several
overnighter
include
five
in
other
country
and
have
met
so
many
great
people
in
july
a
decade
after
the
first
one
open
there
be
apple
store
the
big
be
in
london
s
covent
garden
the
tallest
in
tokyo
s
ginza
the
average
annual
revenue
per
store
be
million
and
the
total
net
sale
in
fiscal
be
billion
but
the
store
do
even
more
they
directly
account
for
only
of
apple
s
revenue
but
by
create
buzz
and
brand
awareness
they
indirectly
help
boost
everything
the
company
do
even
as
he
be
fight
the
effect
of
cancer
in
job
spent
time
envision
future
store
project
such
as
the
one
he
want
to
build
in
new
york
city
s
grand
central
terminal
one
afternoon
he
show
me
a
picture
of
the
fifth
avenue
store
and
point
to
the
eighteen
piece
of
glass
on
each
side
this
be
state
of
the
art
in
glass
technology
at
the
time
he
say
we
have
to
build
our
own
autoclave
to
make
the
glass
then
he
pull
out
a
draw
in
which
the
eighteen
pane
be
replace
by
four
huge
pane
that
be
what
he
want
to
do
next
he
say
once
again
it
be
a
challenge
at
the
intersection
of
aesthetic
and
technology
if
we
want
to
do
it
with
our
current
technology
we
would
have
to
make
the
cube
a
foot
shorter
he
say
and
i
didn
t
want
to
do
that
so
we
have
to
build
some
new
autoclave
in
china
ron
johnson
be
not
thrill
by
the
idea
he
thought
the
eighteen
pane
actually
look
well
than
four
pane
would
the
proportion
we
have
today
work
magically
with
the
colonnade
of
the
gm
building
he
say
it
glitter
like
a
jewel
box
i
think
if
we
get
the
glass
too
transparent
it
will
almost
go
away
to
a
fault
he

at

job
would
stand

he
love
whiteboards
because
they
give
him
complete
control
of

they
engender
focus
and
ask
what

the

next
people

down
and
then
cross
off
the

he
decreed
dumb
after
much
jockeying
the
group
would
come
up
with

then

would
slash

and
announce
we
can

by
apple
have
revive

it
be
at
that
moment
that
job
launch
a
new
grand
strategy
that
would
transform
apple
and
with
it
the
entire
technology
industry
the
personal
computer
instead
of
edge
toward
the
sideline
would
become
a
digital
hub
that
coordinate
a
variety
of
device
from
music
player
to
video
recorder
to
camera
you
d
link
and
sync
all
these
device
with
your
computer
and
it
would
manage
your
music
picture
video
text
and
all
aspect
of
what
job
dubbed
your
digital
lifestyle
apple
would
no
longer
be
just
a
computer
company
indeed
it
would
drop
that
word
from
its
name
but
the
macintosh
would
be
reinvigorate
by
become
the
hub
for
an
astound
array
of
new
gadget
include
the
ipod
and
iphone
and
ipad
when
he
be
turn
thirty
job
have
use
a
metaphor
about
record
album
he
be
muse
about
why
folk
over
thirty
develop
rigid
thought
pattern
and
tend
to
be
less
innovative
people
get
stuck
in
those
pattern
just
like
groove
in
a
record
and
they
never
get
out
of
them
he
say
at
age
forty
five
job
be
now
about
to
get
out
of
his
groove
firewire
job
s
vision
that
your
computer
could
become
your
digital
hub
go
back
to
a
technology
call
firewire
which
apple
developed
in
the
early
s
it
be
a
high
speed
serial
port
that
move
digital
file
such
as
video
from
one
device
to
another
japanese
camcorder
maker
adopt
it
and
job
decide
to
include
it
on
the
update
version
of
the
imac
that
come
out
in
october
he
begin
to
see
that
firewire
could
be
part
of
a
system
that
move
video
from
camera
onto
a
computer
where
it
could
be
edit
and
distribute
to
make
this
work
the
imac
need
to
have
great
video
edit
software
so
job
go
to
his
old
friend
at
adobe
the
digital
graphic
company
and
ask
them
to
make
a
new
mac
version
of
adobe
premiere
which
be
popular
on
window
computer
adobe
s
executive
stun
job
by
flatly
turn
him
down
the
macintosh
they
say
have
too
few
user
to
make
it
worthwhile
job
be
furious
and
felt
betrayed
i
put
adobe
on
the
map
and
they
screw
me
he
later
claimed
adobe
make
matter
even
bad
when
it
also
didn
t
write
its
other
popular
program
such
as
photoshop
for
the
mac
osx
even
though
the
macintosh
be
popular
among
designer
and
other
creative
people
who
use
those
application
job
never
forgave
adobe
and
a
decade
later
he
get
into
a
public
war
with
the
company
by
not
permit
adobe
flash
to
run
on
the
ipad
he
take
away
a
valuable
lesson
that
reinforce
his
desire
for
end
to
end
control
of
all
key
element
of
a
system
my
primary
insight
when
we
be
screw
by
adobe
in
be
that
we
shouldn
t
get
into
any
business
where
we
didn
t
control
both
the
hardware
and
the
software
otherwise
we
d
get
our
head
hand
to
us
so
start
in
apple
begin
to
produce
application
software
for
the
mac
with
a
focus
on
people
at
the
intersection
of
art
and
technology
these
include
final
cut
pro
for
edit
digital
video
imovie
which
be
a
simpler
consumer
version
idvd
for
burning
video
or
music
onto
a
disc
iphoto
to
compete
with
adobe
photoshop
garageband
for
create
and
mix
music
itunes
for
manage
your
song
and
the
itunes
store
for
buying
song
the
idea
of
the
digital
hub
quickly
come
into
focus
i
first
understood
this
with
the
camcorder
job
say
use
imovie
make
your
camcorder
ten
time
more
valuable
instead
of
have
hundred
of
hour
of
raw
footage
you
would
never
really
sit
through
you
could
edit
it
on
your
computer
make
elegant
dissolve
add
music
and
roll
credit
listing
yourself
as
executive
producer
it
allow
people
to
be
creative
to
express
themselves
to
make
something
emotional
that
s
when
it
hit
me
that
the
personal
computer
be
go
to
morph
into
something
else
job
have
another
insight
if
the
computer
serve
as
the
hub
it
would
allow
the
portable
device
to
become
simpler
a
lot
of
the
function
that
the
device
try
to
do
such
as
edit
the
video
or
picture
they
do
poorly
because
they
have
small
screen
and
could
not
easily
accommodate
menu
fill
with
lot
of
function
computer
could
handle
that
more
easily
and
one
more
thing
what
job
also
saw
be
that
this
work
best
when
everything
the
device
computer
software
application
firewire
be
all
tightly
integrate
i
become
even
more
of
a
believer
in
provide
end
to
end
solution
he
recall
the
beauty
of
this
realization
be
that
there
be
only
one
company
that
be
well
position
to
provide
such
an
integrate
approach
microsoft
write
software
dell
and
compaq
make
hardware
sony
produce
a
lot
of
digital
device
adobe
developed
a
lot
of
application
but
only
apple
do
all
of
these
thing
we
re
the
only
company
that
own
the
whole
widget
the
hardware
the
software
and
the
operating
system
he
explain
to
time
we
can
take
full
responsibility
for
the
user
experience
we
can
do
thing
that
the
other
guy
can
t
do
apple
s
first
integrate
foray
into
the
digital
hub
strategy
be
video
with
firewire
you
could
get
your
video
onto
your
mac
and
with
imovie
you
could
edit
it
into
a
masterpiece
then
what
you
d
want
to
burn
some
dvd
so
you
and
your
friend
could
watch
it
on
a
tv
so
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
work
with
the
drive
manufacturer
to
get
a
consumer
drive
that
could
burn
a
dvd
he
say
we
be
the
first
to
ever
ship
that
as
usual
job
focus
on
make
the
product
as
simple
as
possible
for
the
user
and
this
be
the
key
to
its
success
mike
evangelist
who
work
at
apple
on
software
design
recall
demonstrate
to
job
an
early
version
of
the
interface
after
look
at
a
bunch
of
screenshots
job
jumped
up
grabbed
a
marker
and
drew
a
simple
rectangle
on
a
whiteboard
here
s
the
new
application
he
say
it
s
get
one
window
you
drag
your
video
into
the
window
then
you
click
the
button
that
say
burn
that
s
it
that
s
what
we
re
go
to
make
evangelist
be
dumbfound
but
it
lead
to
the
simplicity
of
what
become
idvd
job
even
help
design
the
burn
button
icon
job
knew
digital
photography
be
also
about
to
explode
so
apple
developed
way
to
make
the
computer
the
hub
of
your
photo
but
for
the
first
year
at
least
he
take
his
eye
off
one
really
big
opportunity
hp
and
a
few
others
be
produce
a
drive
that
burn
music
cd
but
job
decreed
that
apple
should
focus
on
video
rather
than
music
in
addition
his
angry
insistence
that
the
imac
get
rid
of
its
tray
disk
drive
and
use
instead
a
more
elegant
slot
drive
meant
that
it
could
not
include
the
first
cd
burner
which
be
initially
make
for
the
tray
format
we
kind
of
miss
the
boat
on
that
he
recall
so
we
need
to
catch
up
real
fast
the
mark
of
an
innovative
company
be
not
only
that
it
come
up
with
new
idea
first
but
also
that
it
know
how
to
leapfrog
when
it
find
itself
behind
itunes
it
didn
t
take
job
long
to
realize
that
music
be
go
to
be
huge
by
people
be
rip
music
onto
their
computer
from
cd
or
download
it
from
file
share
service
such
as
napster
and
burning
playlist
onto
their
own
blank
disk
that
year
the
number
of
blank
cd
sell
in
the
united
state
be
million
there
be
only
million
people
in
the
country
that
meant
some
people
be
really
into
burning
cd
and
apple
wasn
t
catering
to
them
i
felt
like
a
dope
he
told
fortune
i
thought
we
have
miss
it
we
have
to
work
hard
to
catch
up
job
add
a
cd
burner
to
the
imac
but
that
wasn
t
enough
his
goal
be
to
make
it
simple
to
transfer
music
from
a
cd
manage
it
on
your
computer
and
then
burn
playlist
other
company
be
already
make
music
management
application
but
they
be
clunky
and
complex
one
of
job
s
talent
be
spot
market
that
be
fill
with
second
rate
product
he
look
at
the
music
apps
that
be
available
include
real
jukebox
window
medium
player
and
one
that
hp
be
include
with
its
cd
burner
and
come
to
a
conclusion
they
be
so
complicate
that
only
a
genius
could
figure
out
half
of
their
feature
that
be
when
bill
kincaid
come
in
a
former
apple
software
engineer
he
be
drive
to
a
track
in

california
to
race
his
formula
ford

while
a
bit
incongruously
listen
to

he
heard
a
report
about
a
portable
music
player
call
the
rio
that
played
a
digital
song

he
perked
up
when
the
reporter
say
something
like
don
t
get
excite
mac
user
because
it
won
t
work
with
mac
kincaid
say
to
himself
ha
i
can
fix
that
to
help
him
write
a
rio
manager
for
the
mac
he
call
his
friend
jeff
robbin
and
dave

also
former
apple
software

their
product

and
software
for

when

push
his
team
to
come
up
with

in
and

for
the
next
decade

so
valuable
he
once
allow
a
time
reporter
to
meet
him
only
after
extract
the
promise
that
the
reporter
would
not
print
his
last
name
job
personally
work
with
them
to
transform
soundjam
into
an
apple
product
it
be
laden
with
all
sort

push
them
to
make
it
simpler
and
more
fun
instead

and
also
a

they
dubbed

job
unveiled
itunes
at
the
january

as
part
of

later
put

burn
that
afternoon
job
happen
to
be
meeting
with
john
markoff
of
the

at
the
end
job
sat
down
at
his
mac
and
show
off
itunes
it
reminds
me
of
my
youth
he
say
as
the
psychedelic
pattern
dance
on
the
screen
that
lead
him
to
reminisce
about
drop
acid
take
lsd
be
one
of
the
two
or
three
most
important
thing
he
d
do
in
his
life
job
told
markoff
people
who
have
never
take
acid
would
never
fully
understand
him
the
ipod
the
next
step
for
the
digital
hub
strategy
be
to
make
a
portable
music
player
job
realize
that
apple
have
the
opportunity
to
design
such
a
device
in
tandem
with
the
itunes
software
allow
it
to
be
simpler
complex
task
could
be
handle
on
the
computer
easy
one
on
the
device
thus
be
born
the
ipod
the
device
that
would
begin
the
transformation
of
apple
from
be
a
computer
maker
into
be
the
world
s
most
valuable
company
job
have
a
special
passion
for
the
project
because
he
love
music
the
music
player
that
be
already
on
the
market
he
told
his
colleague
truly
suck
phil
schiller
jon
rubinstein
and
the
rest
of
the
team
agree
as
they
be
building
itunes
they
spent
time
with
the
rio
and
other
player
while
merrily
trash
them
we
would
sit
around
and
say
these
thing
really
stink
schiller
recall
they
held
about
sixteen
song
and
you
couldn
t
figure
out
how
to
use
them
job
begin
push
for
a
portable
music
player
in
the
fall
of
but
rubinstein
respond
that
the
necessary
component
be
not
available
yet
he
ask
job
to
wait
after
a
few
month
rubinstein
be
able
to
score
a
suitable
small
lcd
screen
and
rechargeable
lithium
polymer
battery
the
tougher
challenge
be
find
a
disk
drive
that
be
small
enough
but
have
ample
memory
to
make
a
great
music
player
then
in

for
many
year
fadell
recall
rubinstein
agree
i
don
t
think
he
ever
forgave
me
for
that
fadell
and
rubinstein
be
fat
to
clash
because
they
both
thought
that
they
have
father
the
ipod
as
rubinstein
saw
it
he
have
be
give

key
element
he
have
then
brought
in

put
it
together
he
and
others
who
resent
fadell
s
visibility
begin
to
refer
to
him
as
tony

but
from
fadell
s
perspective
before
he
come
to
apple
he
have
already
come
up
with
plan
for
a
great
mp
player
and
he
have
be
shopping
it
around
to
other
company
before
he
have
agree
to
come
to
apple
the
issue
of
who
deserve
the
most
credit
for
the
ipod
or
should
get
the
title
podfather
would
be
fought
over
the
year
in
interview
article
web
page
and
even
wikipedia
entry
but
for

few
month
they
be
too
busy
to
bicker
job
want
the
ipod
out
by
christmas
and
this
meant
have
it
ready
to
unveil
in

they
look
around
for
other
company
that
be
design
mp
player
that
could
serve
as
the
foundation
for
apple
s
work
and
settle
on
a
small
company
name
portalplayer
fadell
told
the
team
there
this
be
the
project
that
s
go
to
remold
apple
and
ten
year
from
now
it
s
go
to
be
a
music
business
not
a
computer
business
he
convince
them
to
sign
an
exclusive
deal
and
his
group
begin
to
modify
portalplayer
s
deficiency
such
as
its
complex
interface
short
battery
life
and
inability
to
make
a
playlist
longer
than
ten
song
that
s
it
there
be
certain
meeting
that
be
memorable
both
because
they
mark
a
historic
moment
and
because
they
illuminate
the
way
a
leader
operates
such
be
the
case
with
the
gathering
in
apple
s
fourth
floor
conference
room
in
april
where
job
decide
on
the
fundamental
of

to
hear

rubinstein
schiller
ive
jeff
robbin
and
marketing
director
stan
ng
fadell
didn
t
know
job
and
he
be
understandably
intimidate
when
he
walk
into
the
conference
room
i
sat
up
and
thought
whoa
there
s
steve
i
be
really
on
guard
because
i
d
heard
how
brutal
he
could
be
the
meeting
start
with
a
presentation
of
the
potential
market
and
what
other
company
be
do
job
as
usual
have
no
patience
he
won
t
pay
attention
to
a
slide
deck
for
more
than
a
minute
fadell
say
when
a
slide
show
other
possible
player
in
the
market
he
wave
it
away
don
t
worry
about
sony
he
say
we
know
what
we
re
do
and
they
don
t
after
that
they
quit
show
slide
and
instead
job
pepper
the
group
with
question
fadell
take
away
a
lesson
steve
prefers
to
be
in
the
moment
talk
thing
through
he
once
told
me
if
you
need
slide
it
show
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
talk
about
instead
job
like
to
be
show
physical
object
that
he
could
feel
inspect
and
fondle
so
fadell
brought
three
different
model
to
the
conference
room
rubinstein
have
coached
him
on
how
to
reveal
them
sequentially
so
that
his
prefer
choice
would
be
the
pi
ce
de
r
sistance
they
hid
the
mockup
of
that
option
under
a
wooden
bowl
at
the
center
of
the
table
fadell
begin
his
show
and
tell
by
take
the
various
part
they
be
use
out
of
a
box
and
spread
them
on
the
table
there
be
the
inch
drive
lcd
screen
board
and
battery
all
label
with
their
cost
and
weight
as
he
displayed
them
they
discuss
how
the
price
or
size
might
come
down
over
the
next
year
or
so
some
of
the
piece
could
be
put
together
like
lego
block
to
show
the
option
then
fadell
begin
unveil
his
model
which
be
make
of
styrofoam
with
fishing
lead
insert
to
give
them
the
proper
weight
the
first
have
a
slot
for
a
removable
memory
card
for
music
job
dismiss
it
as
complicate
the
second
have
dynamic
ram
memory
which
be
cheap
but
would
lose
all
of
the
song
if
the
battery
ran
out
job
be
not
pleased
next
fadell
put
a
few
of
the
piece
together
to
show
what
a
device
with
the
inch
hard
drive
would
be
like
job
seem
intrigue
the
show
climaxed
with
fadell
lift
the
bowl
and
reveal
a
fully
assemble
model
of
that
alternative
i
be
hop
to
be
able
to
play
more
with
the
lego
part
but
steve
settle
right
on
the
hard
drive
option
just
the
way
we
have
model
it
fadell
recall
he
be
rather
stun
by
the
process
i
be
use
to
be
at
philip
where
decision
like
this
would
take
meeting
after
meeting
with
a
lot
of
powerpoint
presentation
and
go
back
for
more
study
next
it
be
phil
schiller
s
turn
can
i
bring
out
my
idea
now
he
ask
he
left
the
room
and
return
with
a
handful
of
ipod
model
all
of
which
have
the
same
device
on
the
front
the
soon
to
be
famous
trackwheel
i
have
be
think
of
how
you
go
through
a
playlist
he
recall
you
can
t
press
a
button
hundred
of
time
wouldn
t
it
be
great
if
you
could
have
a
wheel
by
turn
the
wheel
with
your
thumb
you
could
scroll
through
song
the
longer
you
kept
turn
the
faster
the
scroll
get
so
you
could
zip
through
hundred
easily
job
shout
that
s
it
he
get
fadell
and
the
engineer
work
on
it
once
the
project
be
launch
job
immerse
himself
in
it
daily
his
main
demand
be
simplify
he
would
go
over
each
screen
of
the
user
interface
and
apply
a
rigid
test
if
he
want
a
song
or
a
function
he
should
be
able
to
get
there
in
three
click
and
the
click
should
be
intuitive
if
he
couldn
t
figure
out
how
to
navigate
to
something
or
if
it
take
more
than
three
click
he
would
be
brutal
there
would
be
time
when
we
d
rack
our
brain
on
a
user
interface
problem
and
think
we
d
consider
every
option
and
he
would
go
do
you
think
of
this
say
fadell
and
then
we
d
all
go
holy
shit
he
d
redefine
the
problem
or
approach
and
our
little
problem
would
go
away
every
night
job
would
be
on
the
phone
with
idea
fadell
and
the
others
would
call
each
other
up
discus
job
s
late
suggestion
and
conspire
on
how
to
nudge
him
to
where
they
want
him
to
go
which
work
about
half
the
time
we
would
have
this
swirl
thing
of
steve
s
late
idea
and
we
would
all
try
to
stay
ahead
of
it
say
fadell
every
day
there
be
something
like
that
whether
it
be
a
switch
here
or
a
button
color
or
a
pricing
strategy
issue
with
his
style
you
need
to
work
with
your
peer
watch
each
other
s
back
one
key
insight
job
have
be
that
as
many
function
as
possible
should
be
perform
use
itunes
on
your
computer
rather
than
on
the
ipod
as
he
later
recall
in
order
to
make
the
ipod
really
easy
to
use
and
this
take
a
lot
of
argue
on
my
part
we
need
to
limit
what
the
device
itself
would
do
instead
we
put
that
functionality
in
itunes
on
the
computer
for
example
we
make
it
so
you
couldn
t
make
playlist
use
the
device
you
make
playlist
on
itunes
and
then
you
sync
with
the
device
that
be
controversial
but
what
make
the
rio
and
other
device
so
brain
dead
be
that
they
be
complicate
they
have
to
do
thing
like
make
playlist
because
they
weren
t
integrate
with
the
jukebox
software
on
your
computer
so
by
own
the
itunes
software
and
the
ipod
device
that
allow
us
to
make
the
computer
and
the
device
work
together
and
it
allow
us
to
put
the
complexity
in
the
right
place
the
most
zen
of
all
simplicity
be
job
s
decree
which
astonish
his
colleague
that
the
ipod
would
not
have
an
on
off
switch
it
become
true
of
most
apple
device
there
be
no
need
for
one
apple
s
device
would
go
dormant
if
they
be
not
be
use
and
they
would
wake
up
when
you
touch
any
key
but
there
be
no
need
for
a
switch
that
would
go
click
you
re
off
good
bye
suddenly
everything
have
fall
into
place
a
drive
that
would
hold
a
thousand
song
an
interface
and
scroll
wheel
that
would
let
you
navigate
a
thousand
song
a
firewire
connection
that
could
sync
a
thousand
song
in
under
ten
minute
and
a
battery
that
would
last
through
a
thousand
song
we
suddenly
be
look
at
one
another
and
say
this
be
go
to
be
so
cool
job
recall
we
knew
how
cool
it
be
because
we
knew
how
badly
we
each
want
one
personally
and
the
concept
become
so
beautifully
simple
a
thousand
song
in
your
pocket
one
of
the
copywriter
suggest
they
call
it
a
pod
job
be
the
one
who
borrowing
from
the
imac
and
itunes
name
modify
that
to
ipod
the
whiteness
of
the
whale
jony
ive
have
be
play
with
the
foam
model
of
the
ipod
and
try
to
conceive
what
the
finish
product
should
look
like
when
an
idea
occur
to
him
on
a
morning
drive
from
his
san
francisco
home
to
cupertino
its
face
should
be
pure
white
he
told
his
colleague
in
the
car
and
it
should
connect
seamlessly
to
a
polished
stainless
steel
back
most
small
consumer
product
have
this
disposable
feel
to
them
say
ive
there
be
no
cultural
gravity
to
them
the
thing
i
m
proudest
of
about
the
ipod
be
that
there
be
something
about
it
that
make
it
feel
significant
not
disposable
the
white
would
be
not
just
white
but
pure
white
not
only
the
device
but
the
headphone
and
the
wire
and
even
the
power
block
he
recall
pure
white
others
kept
argue
that
the
headphone
of
course
should
be
black
like
all
headphone
but
steve
get
it
immediately
and
embrace
white
say
ive
there
would
be
a
purity
to
it
the
sinuous
flow
of
the
white
earbud
wire
help
make
the
ipod
an
icon
as
ive
described
it
there
be
something
very
significant
and
nondisposable
about
it
yet
there
be
also
something
very
quiet
and
very
restrain
it
wasn
t
wag
its
tail
in
your
face
it
be
restrain
but
it
be
also
crazy
with
those
flow
headphone
that
s
why
i
like
white
white
isn
t
just
a
neutral
color
it
be
so
pure
and
quiet
bold
and
conspicuous
and
yet
so
inconspicuous
as
well
lee
clow
s
advertising
team
at
tbwa
chiat
day
want
to
celebrate
the
iconic
nature
of
the
ipod
and
its
whiteness
rather
than
create
more
traditional
product
introduction
ad
that
show
off
the

s
feature
james
vincent
a
lanky
young
brit
who
have
played
in
a
band
and
work
as
a
dj
have
recently
join
the
agency
and
he
be
a
natural
to
help
focus
apple
s
advertising
on
hip
millennial
generation
music
lover
rather
than
rebel
baby
boomer
with
the
help
of
the
art
director
susan
alinsangan
they
create
a
series
of
billboard
and
poster
for
the
ipod
and
they
spread
the
option
on
job
s
conference
room
table
for
his
inspection
at
the
far
right
end
they
place
the
most
traditional
option
which
feature
straightforward
photo
of
the
ipod
on
a
white
background
at
the
far
left
end
they
place
the
most
graphic
and
iconic
treatment
which
show
just
a
silhouette
of
someone
dance
while
listen
to
an
ipod
its
white
earphone
wire
wave
with
the
music
it
understood
your
emotional
and
intensely
personal
relationship
with
the
music
vincent
say
he
suggest
to
duncan
milner
the
creative
director
that
they
all
stand
firmly
at
the
far
left
end
to
see
if
they
could
get
job
to
gravitate
there
when
he
walk
in
he
go
immediately
to
the
right
look
at
the
stark
product
picture
this
look
great
he
say
let
s
talk
about
these
vincent
milner
and
clow
do
not
budge
from
the
other
end
finally
job
look
up
glance
at
the
iconic
treatment
and
say
oh
i
guess
you
like
this
stuff
he
shook
his
head
it
doesn
t
show
the
product
it
doesn
t
say
what
it
be
vincent
propose
that
they
use
the
iconic
image
but
add
the
tagline
song
in
your
pocket
that
would
say
it
all
job
glance
back
toward
the
right
end
of
the
table
then
finally
agree
not
surprisingly
he
be
soon
claim
that
it
be
his
idea
to
push
for
the
more
iconic
ad
there
be
some
skeptic
around
who
ask
how
s
this
go
to
actually
sell
an
ipod
job
recall
that
s
when
it
come
in
handy
to
be
the
ceo
so
i
could
push
the
idea
through
job
realize
that
there
be
yet
another
advantage
to
the
fact
that
apple
have
an
integrate
system
of
computer
software
and
device
it
meant
that
sale
of
the
ipod
would
drive
sale
of
the
imac
that
in
turn
meant
that
he
could
take
money
that
apple
be
spending
on
imac
advertising
and
shift
it
to
spending
on
ipod
ad
get
a
double
bang
for
the
buck
a
triple
bang
actually
because
the
ad
would
lend
luster
and
youthfulness
to
the
whole
apple
brand
he
recall
i
have
this
crazy
idea
that
we
could
sell
just
as
many
mac
by
advertising
the
ipod
in
addition
the
ipod
would
position
apple
as
evoke
innovation
and
youth
so
i
move
million
of
advertising
money
to
the
ipod
even
though
the
category
didn
t
justify
one
hundredth
of
that
that
meant
that
we
completely
dominate
the
market
for
music
player
we
outspent
everybody
by
a
factor
of
about
a
hundred
the
television
ad
show
the
iconic
silhouette
dance
to
song
picked
by
job
clow
and
vincent
find
the
music
become
our
main
fun
at
our
weekly
marketing
meeting
say
clow
we
d
play
some
edgy
cut
steve
would
say
i
hate
that
and
james
would
have
to
talk
him
into
it
the
ad
help
popularize
many
new
band
most
notably
the
black
eyed
pea
the
ad
with
hey
mama
be
the
classic
of
the
silhouette
genre
when
a
new
ad
be
about
to
go
into
production
job
would
often
have
second
thought
call
up
vincent
and
insist
that
he
cancel
it
it
sound
a
bit
poppy
or
it
sound
a
bit
trivial
he
would
say
let
s
call
it
off
james
would
get
fluster
and
try
to
talk
him
around
hold
on
it
s
go
to
be
great
he
would
argue
invariably
job
would
relent
the
ad
would
be
make
and
he
would
love
it
job
unveiled
the
ipod
on
october
at
one
of
his
signature
product
launch
event
hint
it
s
not
a
mac
the
invitation
tease
when
it
come
time
to
reveal
the
product
after
he
described
its
technical
capability
job
do
not
do
his
usual
trick
of
walk
over
to
a
table
and
pull
off
a
velvet
cloth
instead
he
say
i
happen
to
have
one
right
here
in
my
pocket
he
reach
into
his
jean
and
pull
out
the
gleam
white
device
this
amaze
little
device
hold
a
thousand
song
and
it
go
right
in
my
pocket
he
slip
it
back
in
and
amble
offstage
to
applause
initially
there
be
some
skepticism
among
tech
geek
especially
about
the
price
in
the
blogosphere
the
joke
be
that
ipod
stood
for
idiot
price
our
device
however
consumer
soon
make
it
a
hit
more
than
that
the
ipod
become
the
essence
of
everything
apple
be
destine
to
be
poetry
connect
to
engineering
art
and
creativity
intersect
with
technology
design
that
s
bold
and
simple
it
have
an
ease
of
use
that
come
from
be
an
integrate
end
to
end
system
from
computer
to
firewire
to

to
software
to
content
management
when
you
take
an
ipod
out
of
the
box
it
be
so
beautiful
that
it
seem
to
glow
and
it
make
all
other
music
player
look
as
if
they
have
be
design
and
manufacture
in
uzbekistan
not
since
the

so
propel
a
company
into
the
future
if
anybody
be
ever
wonder
why
apple
be
on
the
earth
i
would
hold
up
this
as
a
good
example
job
told
newsweek
s
steve
levy
at
the
time
wozniak
who
have
long
be
skeptical
of

system
begin
to
revise
his
philosophy
wow
it
make
sense
that
apple
be
the

to
come
up
with

both

the
result
that
the
two
work
well
together
the

of
aol
time
warner
be
work
with
sony
in
that
effort
and
they
hop
to
get
apple
to
be
part
of
their
consortium
so
a
group
of
them
flew
to
cupertino
in
january
to
see
job
it
be
not
an
easy
meeting
vidich
have
a
cold
and
be
lose
his
voice
so
his
deputy
kevin
gage
begin
the
presentation
job
sit
at
the
head
of
the
conference
table
fidget
and
look
annoyed
after
four
slide
he
wave
his
hand
and
broke
in
you
have
your
head
up
your
ass
he
point
out
everyone
turn
to
vidich
who
struggle
to
get
his
voice
work
you
re
right
he
say
after
a
long
pause
we
don
t
know
what
to
do
you
need
to
help
us
figure
it
out
job
later
recall
be
slightly
take
aback
and
he
agree
that
apple
would
work
with
the
warner
sony
effort
if
the
music
company
have
be
able
to
agree
on
a
standardize
encode
method
for
protect
music
file
then
multiple
online
store
could
have
proliferate
that
would
have
make
it
hard
for
job
to
create
an
itunes
store
that
allow
apple
to
control
how
online
sale
be
handle
sony
however
hand
job
that
opportunity
when
it
decide
after
the
january
cupertino
meeting
to
pull
out
of
the
talk
because
it
favor
its
own
proprietary
format
from
which
it
would
get
royalty
you
know
steve
he
have
his
own
agenda
sony
s
ceo
nobuyuki
idei
explain
to
red
herring
editor
tony
perkins
although
he
be
a
genius
he
doesn
t
share
everything
with
you
this
be
a
difficult
person
to
work
with
if
you
be
a
big
company
it
be
a
nightmare
howard
stringer
then
head
of
sony
north
america
add
about
job
try
to
get
together
would
frankly
be
a
waste
of
time
instead
sony
join
with
universal
to
create
a
subscription
service
call
pressplay
meanwhile
aol
time
warner
bertelsmann
and
emi
team
up
with
realnetworks
to
create
musicnet
neither
would
license
its
song
to
the
rival
service
so
each
offer
only
about
half
the
music
available
both
be
subscription
service
that
allow
customer
to
stream
song
but
not
keep
them
so
you
lose
access
to
them
if
your
subscription
lapse
they
have
complicate
restriction
and
clunky
interface
indeed
they
would
earn
the
dubious
distinction
of
become
number
nine
on
pc
world
s
list
of
the
bad
tech
product
of
all
time
the
magazine
declare
the
service
stunningly
brain
dead
feature
show
that
the
record
company
still
didn
t
get
it
at
this
point
job
could
have
decide
simply
to
indulge
piracy
free
music
meant
more
valuable
ipod
yet
because
he
really
like
music
and
the
artist
who
make
it
he
be
oppose
to
what
he
saw
as
the
theft
of
creative
product
as
he
later
told
me
from
the
early
day
at
apple
i
realize
that
we
thrive
when
we
create
intellectual
property
if
people
copy
or
stole
our
software
we
d
be
out
of
business
if
it
weren
t
protect
there
d
be
no
incentive
for
us
to
make
new
software
or
product
design
if
protection
of
intellectual
property
begin
to
disappear
creative
company
will
disappear
or
never
get
start
but
there
s
a
simpler
reason
it
s
wrong
to
steal
it
hurt
other
people
and
it
hurt
your
own
character
he
knew
however
that
the
best
way
to
stop
piracy
in
fact
the
only
way
be
to
offer
an
alternative
that
be
more
attractive
than
the
brain
dead
service
that
music
company
be
concoct
we
believe
that
of
the
people
steal
stuff
don
t
want
to
be
there
s
just
no
legal
alternative
he
told
andy
langer
of
esquire
so
we
say
let
s
create
a
legal
alternative
to
this
everybody
win
music
company
win
the
artist
win
apple
win
and
the
user
win
because
he
get
a
well
service
and
doesn
t
have
to
be
a
thief
so
job
set
out
to
create
an
itunes
store
and
to
persuade
the
five
top
record
company
to
allow
digital
version
of
their
song
to
be
sell
there
i
ve
never
spent
so
much
of
my
time
try
to
convince
people
to
do
the
right
thing
for
themselves
he
recall
because
the
company
be
worried
about
the
pricing
model
and
unbundling
of
album
job
pitch
that
his
new
service
would
be
only
on
the
macintosh
a
mere
of
the
market
they
could
try
the
idea
with
little
risk
we
use
our
small
market
share
to
our
advantage
by
argue
that
if
the
store
turn
out
to
be
destructive
it
wouldn
t
destroy
the
entire
universe
he
recall
job
s
proposal
be
to
sell
digital
song
for
cent
a
simple
and
impulsive
purchase
the
record
company
would
get
cent
of
that
job
insist
that
this
would
be
more
appeal
than
the
monthly
subscription
model
prefer
by
the
music
company
he
believe
that
people
have
an
emotional
connection
to
the
song
they
love
they
want
to
own
sympathy
for
the
devil
and
shelter
from
the
storm
not
just
rent
them
as
he
told
jeff
goodell
of
roll
stone
at
the
time
i
think
you
could
make
available
the
second
come
in
a
subscription
model
and
it
might
not
be
successful
job
also
insist
that
the
itunes
store
would
sell
individual
song
not
just
entire
album
that
end
up
be
the
big
cause
of
conflict
with
the
record
company
which
make
money
by
put
out
album
that
have
two
or
three
great
song
and
a
dozen
or
so
filler
to
get
the
song
they
want
consumer
have
to
buy
the
whole
album
some
musician
object
on
artistic
ground
to
job
s
plan
to
disaggregate
album
there
s
a
flow
to
a
good
album
say
trent
reznor
of
nine
inch
nail
the
song
support
each
other
that
s
the
way
i
like
to
make
music
but
the
objection
be
moot
piracy
and
online
downloads
have
already
deconstruct
the
album
recall
job
you
couldn
t
compete
with
piracy
unless
you
sell
the
song
individually
at
the
heart
of
the
problem
be
a
chasm
between
the
people
who
love
technology
and
those
who
love
artistry
job
love
both
as
he
have
demonstrate
at
pixar
and
apple
and
he
be
thus
position
to
bridge
the
gap
he
later
explain
when
i
go
to
pixar
i
become
aware
of
a
great
divide
tech
company
don
t
understand
creativity
they
don
t
appreciate
intuitive
think
like
the
ability
of
an
a
r
guy
at
a
music
label
to
listen
to
a
hundred
artist
and
have
a
feel
for
which
five
might
be
successful
and
they
think
that
creative
people
just
sit
around
on
couch
all
day
and
be
undisciplined
because
they
ve
not
see
how
driven
and
discipline
the
creative
folk
at
place
like
pixar
be
on
the
other
hand
music
company
be
completely
clueless
about
technology
they
think
they
can
just
go
out
and
hire
a
few
tech
folk
but
that
would
be
like
apple
try
to
hire
people
to
produce
music
we
d
get
second
rate
a
r
people
just
like
the
music
company
end
up
with
second
rate
tech
people
i
m
one
of
the
few
people
who
understands
how
produce
technology
require
intuition
and
creativity
and
how
produce
something
artistic
take
real
discipline
job
have
a
long
relationship
with
barry
schuler
the
ceo
of
the
aol

of

and
begin
to
pick
his
brain
about
how
to
get
the
music
label
into
the
propose
itunes
store
piracy
be
flip
everyone
s
circuit
breaker
schuler
told
him
you
should
use
the
argument
that
because
you
have
an
integrate
end
to
end
service
from
ipod
to
the
store
you
can
best
protect
how
the

day
in

a
call

brit
a
type
such
as
james
vincent
and
jony
ive
that
job
tend
to
like

the
good
steve
be
on

at
one
point
early
in
the
meeting

role
of
diplomat
ames
and
eddy
cue
who
ran
itunes
for

into
an
argument
over
why
radio
in
england
be
not
as
vibrant
as
in
the
united
state
and
job
step
in
say
we
know
about
tech
but
we
don
t

as
much
about

use
aol
i
could
never
find
the

a
prototype
of
the
itunes

ames
be
impressed
yes
yes
that
s
exactly
what
we
ve
be
wait
for
he
say
he
agree
that
warner
music
would
sign
up
and
he
offer
to
help
enlist
other

unlike
any
other
ceo
he
be
totally
engage
with
the
product
ames
and
job
begin
to
hammer
out
the
detail
of
the
itunes
store
include
the
number
of
time
a
track
could
be
put
on
different
device
and
how
the
copy
protection
system
would
work
they
soon
be
in
agreement
and
set
out
to
corral
other
music
label
herd
cat
the
key
player
to
enlist
be
doug
morris
head
of
the
universal
music
group
his
domain
include
must
have
artist
such
as
u
eminem
and
mariah
carey
as
well
as
powerful
label
such
as
motown
and
interscope
geffen
a
m
morris
be
eager
to
talk
more
than
any
other
mogul
he
be
upset
about
piracy
and
fed
up
with
the
caliber
of
the
technology
people
at
the
music
company
it
be
like
the
wild
west
morris
recall
no
one
be
sell
digital
music
and
it
be
awash
with
piracy
everything
we
try
at
the
record
company
be
a
failure
the
difference
in
skill
set
between
the
music
folk
and
technologist
be
just
huge
as
ames
walk
with
job
to
morris
s
office
on
broadway
he
briefed
job
on
what
to
say
it
work
what
impressed
morris
be
that
job
tie
everything
together
in
a
way
that
make
thing
easy
for
the
consumer
and
also
safe
for
the
record
company
steve
do
something
brilliant
say
morris
he
propose
this
complete
system
the
itunes
store
the
music
management
software
the
ipod
itself
it
be
so
smooth
he
have
the
whole
package
morris
be
convince
that
job
have
the
technical
vision
that
be
lack
at
the
music
company
of
course
we
have
to
rely
on
steve
job
to
do
this
he
told
his
own
tech
vice
president
because
we
don
t
have
anyone
at
universal
who
know
anything
about
technology
that
do
not
make
universal
s
technologist
eager
to
work
with
job
and
morris
have
to
keep
order
them
to
surrender
their
objection
and
make
a
deal
quickly
they
be
able
to
add
a
few
more
restriction
to
fairplay
the
apple
system
of
digital
right
management
so
that
a
purchase
song
could
not
be
spread
to
too
many
device
but
in
general
they
go
along
with
the
concept
of
the
itunes
store
that
job

and
brash
chief
of
interscope

and
morris
be
best
friend
who
have
spoken
every
day
for
the
past
thirty
year
when
i
met
steve
i
thought
he
be
our
savior
so
i
immediately
brought
jimmy
in
to
get
his
impression
morris
recall
job
could
be
extraordinarily
charm
when
he
want
to
be
and
he
turn
it
on
when
iovine
flew
out
to
cupertino
for
a
demo
see
how
simple
it
be
he
ask
iovine
your
tech
folk
be
never
go
to
do
this
there
s
no
one
at
the
music
company
who
can
make
it
simple
enough
iovine
call
morris
right
away
this
guy
be
unique
he
say
you
re
right
he
s
get
a
turnkey
solution
they
complain
about
how
they
have
spent
two
year
work
with
sony
and
it
hadn
t
go
anywhere
sony
s
never
go
to
figure
thing
out
he
told
morris
they
agree
to
quit
deal
with
sony
and
join
with
apple
instead
how
sony
miss
this
be
completely
mind
boggling
to
me
a
historic
fuckup
iovine
say
steve
would
fire
people
if
the
division
didn
t
work
together
but
sony
s
division
be
at
war
with
one
another
indeed
sony
provide
a
clear
counterexample
to
apple
it
have
a
consumer
electronics
division
that
make
sleek
product
and
a
music
division
with
beloved
artist
include
bob
dylan
but
because
each
division
try
to
protect
its
own
interest
the
company
as
a
whole
never
get
its
act
together
to
produce
an
end
to
end
service
andy
lack
the
new
head
of
sony
music
have
the
unenviable
task
of
negotiate
with
job
about
whether
sony
would
sell
its
music
in
the
itunes
store
the
irrepressible
and
savvy
lack
have
just
come
from
a
distinguish
career
in
television
journalism
a
producer
at
cbs
news
and
president
of
nbc
and
he
knew
how
to
size
people
up
and
keep
his
sense
of
humor
he
realize
that
for
sony
sell
its
song
in
the
itunes
store
be
both
insane
and
necessary
which
seem
to
be
the
case
with
a
lot
of
decision
in
the
music
business
apple
would
make
out
like
a
bandit
not
just
from
its
cut
on
song
sale
but
from
drive
the
sale
of
ipod
lack
believe
that
since
the
music
company
would
be
responsible
for
the
success
of
the
ipod
they
should
get
a
royalty
from
each
device
sell
job
would
agree
with
lack
in
many
of
their
conversation
and
claim
that
he
want
to
be
a
true
partner
with
the
music
company
steve
you
ve
get
me
if
you
just
give
me
something
for
every
sale
of
your
device
lack
told
him
in
his
boom
voice
it
s
a
beautiful
device
but
our
music
be
help
to
sell
it
that
s
what
true
partnership
mean
to
me
i
m
with
you
job
reply
on
more
than
one
occasion
but
then
he
would
go
to
doug
morris
and
roger
ames
to
lament
in
a
conspiratorial
fashion
that
lack
just
didn
t
get
it
that
he
be
clueless
about
the
music
business
that
he
wasn
t
as
smart
as
morris
and
ames
in
classic
steve
fashion
he
would
agree
to
something
but
it
would
never
happen
say
lack
he
would
set
you
up
and
then
pull
it
off
the
table
he
s
pathological
which
can
be
useful
in
negotiation
and
he
s
a
genius
lack
knew
that
he
could
not
win
his
case
unless
he
get
support
from
others
in
the
industry
but
job
use
flattery
and
the
lure
of
apple
s
marketing
clout
to
keep
the
other
record
label
in
line
if
the
industry
have
stood
together
we
could
have
gotten
a
license
fee
give
us
the
dual
revenue
stream
we
desperately
need
lack
say
we
be
the
one
make
the
ipod
sell
so
it
would
have
be
equitable
that
of
course
be
one
of
the
beauty
of
job
s
end
to
end
strategy
sale
of
song
on
itunes
would
drive
ipod
sale
which
would
drive
macintosh
sale
what
make
it
all
the
more
infuriate
to
lack
be
that
sony
could
have
do
the
same
but
it
never
could
get
its
hardware
and
software
and
content
division
to
row
in
unison
job
try
hard
to
seduce
lack
during
one
visit
to
new
york
he
invite
lack
to
his
penthouse
at
the
four
season
hotel
job
have
already
order
a
breakfast
spread
oatmeal
and
berry
for
them
both
and
be
beyond
solicitous
lack
recall
but
jack
welch
taught
me
not
to
fall
in
love
morris
and
ames
could
be
seduce
they
would
say
you
don
t
get
it
you
re
suppose
to
fall
in
love
and
they
do
so
i
end
up
isolated
in
the
industry
even
after
sony
agree
to
sell
its
music
in
the
itunes
store
the
relationship
remain
contentious
each
new
round
of
renewal
or
change
would
bring
a
showdown
with
andy
it
be
mostly
about
his
big
ego
job
claimed
he
never
really
understood
the
music
business
and
he
could
never
really
deliver
i
thought
he
be
sometimes
a
dick
when
i
told
him
what
job
say
lack
respond
i
fought
for
sony
and
the
music
industry
so
i
can
see
why
he
thought
i
be
a
dick
corral
the
record
label
to
go
along
with
the
itunes
plan
be
not
enough
however
many
of
their
artist
have
carve
out
in
their
contract
that
allow
them
personally
to
control
the
digital
distribution
of
their
music
or
prevent
their
song
from
be
unbundled
from
their
album
and
sell
singly
so
job
set
about
cajole
various
top
musician
which
he
found
fun
but
also
a
lot
harder
than
he
expect
before
the
launch
of
itunes
job
met
with
almost
two
dozen
major
artist
include
bono
mick
jagger
and
sheryl
crow
he
would
call
me
at
home
relentless
at
ten
at
night
to
say
he
still
need
to
get
to
lead
zeppelin
or
madonna
ames
recall
he
be
determine
and
nobody
else
could
have
convince
some
of
these
artist
perhaps
the
odd
meeting
be
when
dr
dre
come
to
visit
job
at
apple
headquarters
job
love
the
beatles
and
dylan
but
he
admit
that
the
appeal
of
rap
elude
him
now
job
need
eminem
and
other
rapper

finally
get
it
right
on
the
other
end
of
the
musical

but
he
go
on
for
two
hour
he
be
a
man

after
a
while
i
start
look
at
him
and

so
fascinate
with
his
passion
job
unveiled
the
itunes

on
april
at
san
francisco

closely
cropped
and
recede
and
a
study
unshaven
look
job
pace
the
stage
and
described
how
napster
demonstrate
that
the
internet
be
make
for
music
delivery
its
offspring
such
as
kazaa
he
say
offer
song
for
free
how
do
you
compete
with
that
to
answer
that
question
he
begin
by
describe
the
downside
of
use
these
free
service
the
downloads
be
unreliable
and
the
quality
be
often
bad
a
lot
of
these
song
be
encode
by
seven
year
old
and
they
don
t
do
a
great
job
in
addition
there
be
no
preview
or
album
art
then
he
add
bad
of
all
it
s
steal
it
s
best
not
to
mess
with
karma
why
have
these
piracy
site
proliferate
then
because
job
say
there
be
no
alternative
the
subscription
service
such
as
pressplay
and
musicnet
treat
you
like
a
criminal
he
say
show
a
slide
of
an
inmate
in
strip
prison
garb
then
a
slide
of
bob
dylan
come
on
the
screen
people
want
to
own
the
music
they
love
after
a
lot
of
negotiate
with
the
record
company
he
say
they
be
willing
to
do
something
with
us
to
change
the
world
the
itunes
store
would
start
with
track
and
it
would
grow
each
day
by
use
the
store
he
say
you
can
own
your
song
burn
them
on
cd
be
assure
of
the
download
quality
get
a

of
a
song
before
you
download

with
your
imovies
and
idvds
to

soundtrack
of
your
life
the
price
just

he
say
less
than
a
third
of
what
a
starbucks
latte
cost
why
be
it
worth
it
because
to
get
the
right
song
from
kazaa
take
about
fifteen
minute
rather
than
a
minute
by
spending
an
hour
of
your
time
to
save
about
four
dollar
he
calculate
you
re
work
for
under
the
minimum
wage
and
one
more
thing
with
itunes
it
s
not
steal
anymore
it
s
good
karma
clap
the
loud
for
that
line
be
the
head
of
the
record
label
in
the
front
row
include
doug
morris
sit
next
to
jimmy
iovine
in
his
usual
baseball
cap
and
the
whole
crowd
from
warner
music
eddy
cue
who
be
in
charge
of
the
store
predict
that
apple
would
sell
a
million
song
in
six
month
instead
the
itunes
store
sell
a
million
song
in
six
day
this
will
go
down
in
history
as
a
turn
point
for
the
music
industry
job
declare
microsoft
we
be
smoke
that
be
the
blunt
email
sent
to
four
colleague
by
jim
allchin
the
microsoft
executive
in
charge
of
window
development
at
p
m
the
day
he
saw
the
itunes
store
it
have
only
one
other
line
how
do
they
get
the
music
company
to
go
along
later
that
even
a
reply
come
from
david
cole
who
be
run
microsoft
s
online
business
group
when
apple
brings
this
to
window
i
assume
they
won
t
make
the
mistake
of
not
bring
it
to
window
we
will
really
be
smoke
he
say
that
the
window
team
need
to
bring
this
kind
of
solution
to
market
add
that
will
require
focus
and
goal
alignment
around
an
end
to
end
service
which
delivers
direct
user
value
something
we
don
t
have
today
even
though
microsoft
have
its
own
internet
service
msn
it
be
not
use
to
provide
end
to
end
service
the
way
apple
be
bill
gate
himself
weigh
in
at
that
night
his
subject
line
apple
s
job
again
indicate
his
frustration
steve
job
s
ability
to
focus
in
on
a
few
thing
that
count
get
people
who
get
user
interface
right
and
market
thing
as
revolutionary
be
amaze
thing
he
say
he
too
express
surprise
that
job
have
be
able
to
convince
the
music
company
to
go
along
with
his
store
this
be
very
strange
to
me
the
music
company
own
operation
offer
a
service
that
be
truly
unfriendly
to
the
user
somehow
they
decide
to
give
apple
the
ability
to
do
something
pretty
good
gate
also
found
it
strange
that
no
one
else
have
create
a
service
that
allow
people
to
buy
song
rather
than
subscribe
on
a
monthly
basis
i
be
not
say
this
strangeness
mean
we
mess
up
at
least
if
we
do
so
do
real
and
pressplay
and
musicnet
and
basically
everyone
else
he
write
now
that
job
have
do
it
we
need
to
move
fast
to
get
something
where
the
user
interface
and
right
be
as
good
i
think
we
need
some
plan
to
prove
that
even
though
job
have
us
a
bit
flat
foot
again
we
can
move
quick
and
both
match
and
do
stuff
well
it
be
an
astonish
private
admission
microsoft
have
again
be
caught
flat
foot
and
it
would
again
try
to
catch
up
by
copying
apple
but
like
sony
microsoft
could
never
make
it
happen
even
after
job
show
the
way
instead
apple
continued
to
smoke
microsoft
in
the
way
that
cole
have
predict
it
port
the
itunes
software
and
store
to
window
but
that
take
some
internal
agonize
first
job
and
his
team
have
to
decide
whether
they
want
the
ipod
to
work
with
window
computer
job
be
initially
oppose
by
keep
the
ipod
for
mac
only
it
be
drive
the
sale
of
mac
even
more
than
we
expect
he
recall
but
line
up
against
him
be
all
four
of
his
top
executive
schiller
rubinstein
robbin
and
fadell
it
be
an
argument
about
what
the
future
of
apple
should
be
we
felt
we
should
be
in
the
music
player
business
not
just
in
the
mac
business
say
schiller
job
always
want
apple
to
create
its
own
unified
utopia
a
magical
wall
garden
where
hardware
and
software
and
peripheral
device
work
well
together
to
create
a
great
experience
and
where
the
success
of
one
product
drove
sale
of
all
the
companion
now
he
be
face
pressure
to
have
his
hottest
new
product
work
with
window
machine
and
it
go
against
his
nature
it
be
a
really
big
argument
for
month
job
recall
me
against
everyone
else
at
one
point
he
declare
that
window
user
would
get
to
use
ipod
over
my
dead
body
but
still
his
team
kept
push
this
need
to
get
to
the
pc
say
fadell
finally
job
declare
until
you
can
prove
to
me
that
it
will
make
business
sense
i
m
not
go
to
do
it
that
be
actually
his
way
of
backing
down
if
you
put
aside
emotion
and
dogma
it
be
easy
to
prove
that
it
make
business
sense
to
allow
window
user
to
buy
ipod
expert
be
call
in
sale
scenario
developed
and
everyone
conclude
this
would
bring
in
more
profit
we
developed
a
spreadsheet
say
schiller
under
all
scenario
there
be
no
amount
of
cannibalization
of
mac
sale
that
would
outweigh
the
sale
of
ipod
job
be
sometimes
willing
to
surrender
despite
his
reputation
but
he
never
won
any
award
for
gracious
concession
speech
screw
it
he
say
at
one
meeting
where
they
show
him
the
analysis
i
m
sick
of
listen
to
you
asshole
go
do
whatever
the
hell
you
want
that
left
another
question
when
apple
allow
the
ipod
to
be
compatible
with
window
machine
should
it
also
create
a
version
of
itunes
to
serve
as
the
music
management
software
for
those
window
user
as
usual
job
believe
the
hardware
and
software
should
go
together
the
user
experience
depend
on
the
ipod
work
in
complete
sync
so
to
speak
with
itunes
software
on
the
computer
schiller
be
oppose
i
thought
that
be
crazy
since
we
don
t
make
window
software
schiller
recall
but
steve
kept
argue
if
we
re
go
to
do
it
we
should
do
it
right
schiller
prevail
at
first
apple
decide
to
allow
the
ipod
to
work
with
window
by
use
software
from
musicmatch
an
outside
company
but
the
software
be
so
clunky
that
it
prove
job
s
point
and
apple
embark
on
a
fast
track
effort
to
produce
itunes
for
window
job
recall
to
make
the
ipod
work
on
pc
we
initially
partner
with
another
company
that
have
a
jukebox
give
them
the
secret
sauce
to
connect
to
the
ipod
and
they
do
a
crappy
job
that
be
the
bad
of
all
world
because
this
other
company
be
control
a
big
piece
of
the
user
experience
so
we
live
with
this
crappy
outside
jukebox
for
about
six
month
and
then
we
finally
get
itunes
write
for
window
in
the
end
you
just
don
t
want
someone
else
to
control
a
big
part
of
the
user
experience
people
may
disagree
with
me
but
i
be
pretty
consistent
about
that
port
itunes
to
window
meant
go
back
to
all
of
the
music
company
which
have
make
deal
to
be
in
itunes
base
on
the
assurance
that
it
would
be
for
only
the
small
universe
of
macintosh
user
and
negotiate
again
sony
be
especially
resistant
andy
lack
thought
it
another
example
of
job
change
the
term
after
a
deal
be
do
it
be
but
by
then
the
other
label
be
happy
about
how
the
itunes
store
be
work
and
go
along
so
sony
be
force
to
capitulate
job
announce
the
launch
of
itunes
for
window
in
october
here
s
a
feature
that
people
thought
we
d
never
add
until
this
happen
he

cool
thing
for

and
music
bono

of
the

why
i

the

everybody

to
understatement
to
the
cheer

the
crowd
he
declare
itunes
for
window
be
probably
the
best
window
app
ever
write
microsoft
be
not
grateful
they
re
pursue
the
same
strategy
that
they
pursue
in
the
pc
business
control
both
the
hardware
and

told

week
we
ve
always
do
thing
a
little
bit
differently
than
apple
in
term
of
give
people
choice
it
be
not
until
three
year
later
in
november
that
microsoft
be
finally
able
to
release
its
own
answer
to
the
ipod
it
be
call
the
zune
and
it
look
like
an
ipod
though
a
bit
clunkier
two
year
later
it
have
achieve
a
market
share

brutal
about
the
cause
of
the

uninspired
design
and

weakness
the
old
i
get
the
more
i
see
how
much
motivation
matter
the
zune
be
crappy
because
the
people
at
microsoft
don
t
really
love
music
or
art
the
way
we
do
we
won
because
we
personally
love
music
we
make
the
ipod
for
ourselves
and
when
you

do
something

first
annual
meeting

apple

of

howard
stringer
look
on
here
s
the
walkman
killer
there
s
no
mystery
meat
the
reason
you
bought
a
music
company
be
so
that
you
could
be
the
one
to
make
a
device
like
this
you
can
do
well
but
sony
couldn
t
it
have
pioneer
portable
music
with
the
walkman
it
have
a
great
record
company
and
it
have
a
long
history
of
make
beautiful
consumer
device
it
have
all
of
the
asset
to
compete
with
job
s
strategy
of
integration
of
hardware
software
device
and
content
sale
why
do
it
fail
partly
because
it
be
a
company
like
aol
time
warner
that
be
organize
into
division
that
word
itself
be
ominous
with
their
own
bottom
line
the
goal
of
achieve
synergy
in
such
company
by
prod
the
division
to
work
together
be
usually
elusive
job
do
not
organize
apple
into
semiautonomous
division
he
closely
control
all
of
his
team
and
push
them
to
work
as
one
cohesive
and
flexible
company
with
one
profit
and
loss
bottom
line
we
don
t
have
division
with
their
own
p
l
say
tim
cook
we
run
one
p
l
for
the
company
in
addition
like
many
company
sony
worried
about
cannibalization
if
it
built
a
music
player
and
service
that
make
it
easy
for
people
to
share
digital
song
that
might
hurt
sale
of
its
record
division
one
of
job
s
business
rule
be
to
never
be
afraid
of
cannibalize
yourself
if
you
don
t
cannibalize
yourself
someone
else
will
he
say
so
even
though
an
iphone
might
cannibalize
sale
of
an
ipod
or
an
ipad
might
cannibalize
sale
of
a
laptop
that
do
not
deter
him
that
july
sony
appoint
a
veteran
of
the
music
industry
jay
samit
to
create
its
own
itunes
like
service
call
sony
connect
which
would
sell
song
online
and
allow
them
to
play
on
sony
s
portable
music
device
the
move
be
immediately
understood
as
a
way
to
unite
the
sometimes
conflict
electronics
and
content
division
the
new
york
time
report
that
internal
battle
be
see
by
many
as
the
reason
sony
the
inventor
of
the
walkman
and
the
big
player
in
the
portable
audio
market
be

it
last
just
over
three
year
before
sony
shut
it
down
microsoft
be
willing
to
license
its
window
medium
software
and
digital
right
format
to
other
company
just
as
it
have
license
out
its
operating
system
in
the
s
job
on
the
other
hand
would
not
license
out
apple
s
fairplay
to
other
device
maker
it
work
only
on
an
ipod
nor
would
he
allow
other
online
store
to
sell
song
for
use
on
ipod
a
variety
of
expert
say
this
would
eventually
cause
apple
to
lose
market
share
as
it
do
in
the
computer
war
of
the
s
if
apple
continue
to
rely
on
a
proprietary
architecture
the
harvard
business
school
professor
clayton
christensen
told
wire
the
ipod
will
likely
become
a
niche
product
other
than
in
this
case
christensen
be
one
of
the
world
s
most
insightful
business
analyst
and
job
be
deeply
influence
by
his
book
the
innovator

dilemma
bill
gate
make
the
same
argument
there
s
nothing
unique
about

he
say
this
story
have
played
out
on
the
pc
rob
glaser
the
founder
of
realnetworks
try
to
circumvent
apple
s
restriction
in
july
with
a
service
call
harmony
he
have
attempt
to
convince
job
to
license
apple
s
fairplay
format
to
harmony
but
when
that
didn
t
happen
glaser
just
reverse
engineer
it
and
use
it
with
the
song
that
harmony
sell
glaser
s
strategy
be
that
the
song
sell
by
harmony
would
play
on
any
device
include
an
ipod
or
a

a

he
launch
a
marketing
campaign
with
the
slogan
freedom
of

job
be
furious
and
issue
a
release
say
that
apple
be
stun
that
realnetworks
have
adopt
the
tactic
and
ethic
of
a
hacker
to
break
into
the
ipod
realnetworks
respond
by
launch
an
internet
petition
that
demand
hey
apple
don
t
break
my
ipod
job
kept
quiet
for
a
few
month
but
in
october
he
release
a
new
version
of
the
ipod
software
that
cause
song
bought
through
harmony
to
become
inoperable
steve
be
a
one
of
a
kind
guy
glaser
say
you
know
that
about
him
when
you
do
business
with
him
in
the
meantime
job
and
his
team
rubinstein
fadell
robbin
ive
be
able
to
keep
come
up
with
new
version
of
the
ipod
that
extend
apple
s
lead
the
first
major
revision
announce
in
january
be
the
ipod
mini
far
small
than
the
original
ipod
just
the
size
of
a
business
card
it
have
less
capacity
and
be
about
the
same
price
at
one
point
job
decide
to
kill
it
not
see
why
anyone
would
want
to
pay
the
same
for
less
he
doesn
t
do
sport
so
he
didn
t
relate
to
how
it
would
be
great
on
a
run
or
in
the
gym
say
fadell
in
fact
the
mini
be
what
truly
launch
the
ipod
to
market
dominance
by
eliminate
the
competition
from
small
flash
drive
player
in
the
eighteen
month
after
it
be

he
want
to
hear
we
go
through
the
usual
dylan
and
beatles

reflective
and
tapped
on
a
gregorian
chant
spiritus
domini
perform
by
benedictine
monk
for
a
minute
or
so

he
declare
be
his
favorite
classical
composer
he
be
particularly
fond
of

the
first
in

them
sequentially
one
afternoon
the
first
be
an
exuberant
young
brilliant
piece
played
so
fast
it
s
a
revelation
the
later
one
be
so
much
more
spare
and
stark
you
sense
a
very
deep
soul
who
s
be
through
a
lot
in
life
it
s
deeper
and
wiser
job
be
on
his
third
medical
leave
that
afternoon
when
he
played
both
version
and
i
ask
which
he
like
well
gould
like
the
later
version
much
well
he
say
i
use
to
like
the
earlier
exuberant
one
but
now
i
can
see
where
he
be
come
from
he
then
jumped
from
the
sublime
to
the
sixty
donovan
s
catch
the
wind
when
he
notice
me
look

some
really
good
stuff

he
punch
up

yellow
and
then
admit
that
perhaps
it
be
not
the
best
example
it
sound
well
when
we
be
young
i
ask
what

our
childhood

held
up

these

be
danger
at
your
door
for
a
moment
we
be
back
at

tumultuous
time
when
the
mellowness
of

in
discord
whoa

song
be
about
her
little
girl
he
tapped
on
little
green
and
we
listen
to
the
mournful
melody
and
lyric
that
describe
the
feeling
of
a
mother
who
give
up
a
child

on
while
describe
what

s
a
complex
song
and
it
s
fascinate
to
watch
the
creative
process
as
they
go
back
and
forth
and
finally
create
it
over
a
few
month
lennon
be
always
my
favorite
beatle
he
laugh
as
lennon
stop
during
the
first
take
and
make
the
band
go
back
and
revise
a
chord
do
you
hear
that
little
detour
they
take
it
didn
t
work
so
they
go
back
and
start
from
where
they
be
it
s
so
raw
in
this
version
it
actually
make
them
sound
like
mere
mortal
you
could
actually
imagine
other
people
do
this
up
to
this
version
maybe
not
write
and
conceive
it
but
certainly
play
it
yet
they
just
didn
t
stop
they
be
such
perfectionist
they
kept
it
go
and
go
this
make
a
big
impression
on
me
when
i
be
in
my
thirty
you
could
just
tell
how
much
they
work
at
this
they
do
a
bundle
of
work
between
each
of
these
recording
they
kept
send
it
back
to
make
it
closer
to
perfect
as
he
listens
to
the
third
take
he
point
out
how
the
instrumentation
have
gotten
more
complex
the
way
we
build
stuff
at
apple
be
often
this
way
even
the
number
of
model
we
d
make
of
a
new
notebook
or
ipod
we
would
start
off
with
a
version
and
then
begin
refining
and
refining
do
detailed
model
of
the
design
or
the
button
or
how
a
function
operates
it
s
a
lot
of
work
but
in
the
end
it
just
get
well
and
soon
it
s
like
wow
how
do
they
do
that
where
be
the
screw
it
be
thus
understandable
that
job
be
driven
to
distraction
by
the
fact
that
the
beatles
be
not
on
itunes

struggle
with

and
wind
road
in

about

begin
in
when

after

later
when
apple

paid
apple

have
what
seem
back
then
an
innocuous
stipulation
the
beatles
would
not
produce
any
computer
equipment
and
apple
would
not
market
any
music
product
the
beatles
kept
their
end
of
the
bargain
none
of
them
ever
produce
any
computer
but
apple
end
up
wander
into
the
music
business
it
get
sue
again
in
when
the
mac
incorporate
the
ability
to
play
musical
file
then
again
in
when
the
itunes
store
be
launch
the
legal
issue
be
finally
resolve
in
when
apple
make
a
deal
to
pay
apple
corp
million
for
all
worldwide
right
to
the
name
and
then
license
back
to
the
beatles
the
right
to
use
apple
corp
for
their
record
and
business
holding
ala
this
do
not
resolve
the
issue
of
get
the
beatles
onto
itunes
for
that
to
happen
the
beatles
and
emi
music
which
held
the
right
to
most
of
their
song
have
to
negotiate
their
own
difference
over
how
to
handle
the
digital
right
the
beatles
all
want
to
be
on
itunes
job
later
recall
but
they
and
emi
be
like
an
old
married
couple
they
hate
each
other
but
can
t
get
divorce
the
fact
that
my
favorite
band
be
the
last
holdout
from
itunes
be
something
i
very
much
hop
i
would

would
bono
bono
the
lead
singer
of

deeply
appreciate
apple

marketing
muscle
he
be
confident
that
his
dublin
base
band

still
the
best
in
the

but
in
it
be
try

almost
thirty
year
together
to
reinvigorate
its
image
it
have
produce
an
excite
new
album
with
a
song
that
the
band
s
lead
guitarist
the
edge
declare
to
be
the
mother
of
all
rock
tune
bono
knew
he
need
to
find
a
way
to
get
it
some
traction
so
he
place
a
call
to
job
i
want
something
specific
from
apple
bono
recall
we
have
a
song
call
vertigo
that
feature
an
aggressive
guitar
riff
that
i
knew
would
be
contagious
but
only
if
people
be
expose
to
it
many
many
time
he
be
worried
that
the
era
of
promote
a
song
through
airplay
on
the
radio
be
over
so
bono
visit
job
at
home
in
palo
alto
walk
around
the
garden
and
make
an
unusual
pitch
over
the
year
u
have
spurn
offer
as
high
as
million
to
be
in

now
he
want

in
an

as
part
of
a
mutually
beneficial
package
they
have
never
do
a
commercial
before
job
later
recall
but
they
be
get
ripped
off
by
free
download
they
like
what
we
be
do
with
itunes
and
they
thought
we
could
promote
them
to
a
young
audience
any
other
ceo
would
have
jumped
into
a
mosh
pit
to
have
u
in
an
ad
but
job
push
back
a
bit
apple
didn
t
feature
recognizable
people
in
the
ipod
ad
just
silhouette
the
dylan
ad
have
not
yet
be
make
you
have
silhouette
of
fan
bono
reply
so
couldn
t
the
next
phase
be
silhouette
of
artist
job
say
it
sound
like
an
idea
worth
explore
bono
left
a
copy
of
the
unreleased
album
how
to
dismantle
an
atomic
bomb
for
job
to
hear
he
be
the
only
person
outside
the
band
who
have
it
bono
say
a
round
of
meeting
ensue
job
flew
down
to
talk
to
jimmy
iovine
whose
interscope
record
distribute
u
at
his

in
the
holmby
hill
section

kitchen
with
mcguinness
write
down
the
deal
point
in
the
back
of
his
diary
u
would
appear
in
the
commercial
and
apple
would
vigorously
promote
the
album
in
multiple
venue
range
from
billboard
to
the
itunes
homepage
the
band

would
get
royalty
from
the
sale
of
a
special
u
edition
of
the
ipod

believe
like

that
the
musician
should
get
a
royalty
on

and
this
be

the
imac
job
drove
with
jony
ive
to
show
it
to
the
folk
at
pixar
he
felt
that
the
machine
have
the
spunky
personality
that
would
appeal
to
the
creator
of
buzz
lightyear
and
woody
and
he
love
the
fact
that
ive
and
john
lasseter
share
the
talent
to
connect
art
with
technology
in
a
playful
way
pixar
be
a
haven
where
job
could
escape
the
intensity
in
cupertino
at
apple
the
manager
be
often
excitable
and
exhaust
job
tend
to
be
volatile
and
people
felt
nervous
about
where
they
stood
with
him
at
pixar
the
storyteller
and
illustrator
seem
more
serene
and
behave
more
gently
both
with
each
other
and
even
with
job
in
other
word
the
tone
at
each
place
be
set
at
the
top
by
job
at
apple
but
by
lasseter
at
pixar
job
revel
in
the
earnest
playfulness
of
moviemaking
and
get
passionate
about
the
algorithm
that
enable
such
magic
as
allow
computer
generate
raindrop
to
refract
sunbeam
or
blade
of
grass
to
wave
in
the
wind
but
he
be
able
to
restrain
himself
from
try
to
control
the
creative
process
it
be
at
pixar
that
he
learn
to
let
other
creative
people
flourish
and
take
the
lead
largely
it
be
because
he
love
lasseter
a
gentle
artist
who
like
ive
brought
out
the
best
in
job
job
s
main
role
at
pixar
be
deal
make
in
which
his
natural
intensity
be
an
asset
soon
after
the
release
of
toy
story
he
clashed
with
jeffrey
katzenberg
who
have
left
disney
in
the
summer
of
and
join
with
steven
spielberg
and
david
geffen
to
start
dreamworks
skg
job
believe
that
his
pixar
team
have
told
katzenberg
while
he
be
still
at
disney
about
its
propose
second
movie
a
bug
s
life
and
that
he
have
then
steal
the
idea
of
an
animate
insect
movie
when
he
decide
to
produce
antz
at
dreamworks
when
jeffrey
be
still
run
disney
animation
we
pitch
him
on
a
bug
s
life
job
say
in
sixty
year
of
animation
history
nobody
have
thought
of
do
an
animate
movie
about
insect
until
lasseter
it
be
one
of
his
brilliant
creative
spark
and
jeffrey
left
and
go
to
dreamworks
and
all
of
a
sudden
have
this
idea
for
an
animate
movie
about
oh
insect
and
he
pretend
he
d
never
heard
the
pitch
he
lie
he
lie
through
his
teeth
actually
not
the
real
story
be
a
bit
more
interest
katzenberg
never
heard
the
bug
s
life
pitch
while
at
disney
but
after
he
left
for
dreamworks
he
stayed
in
touch
with
lasseter
occasionally
ping
him
with
one
of
his
typical
hey
buddy
how
you
do
just
check
in
quick
phone
call
so
when
lasseter
happen
to
be
at
the
technicolor
facility
on
the
universal
lot
where
dreamworks
be
also
locate
he
call
katzenberg
and
drop
by
with
a
couple
of
colleague
when
katzenberg
ask
what
they
be
do
next
lasseter
told
him
we
described
to
him
a
bug
s
life
with
an
ant
as
the
main
character
and
told
him
the
whole
story
of
him
organize
the
other
ant
and
enlist
a
group
of
circus
performer
insect
to
fight
off
the
grasshopper
lasseter
recall
i
should
have
be
wary
jeffrey
kept
ask
question
about
when
it
would
be
release
lasseter
begin
to
get
worried
when
in
early
he
heard
rumor
that
dreamworks
might
be
make
its
own
computer
animate
movie
about
ant
he
call
katzenberg
and
ask
him
point
blank
katzenberg
hem
haw
and
ask
where
lasseter
have
heard
that
lasseter
ask
again
and
katzenberg
admit
it
be
true
how
could
you
yell
lasseter
who
very
rarely
raise
his
voice
we
have
the
idea
long
ago
say
katzenberg
who
explain
that
it
have
be
pitch
to
him
by
a
development
director
at
dreamworks
i
don
t
believe
you
lasseter
reply
katzenberg
concede
that
he
have
speed
up
antz
as
a
way
to
counter
his
former
colleague
at
disney
dreamworks
first
major
picture
be
to
be
prince
of
egypt
which
be
schedule
to
be
release
for
thanksgiving
and
he
be
appalled
when
he
heard
that
disney
be
planning
to
release
pixar
s
a
bug
s
life
that
same
weekend
so
he
have
rush
antz
into
production
to
force
disney
to
change
the
release
date
of
a
bug
s
life
fuck
you
reply
lasseter
who
do
not
normally
use
such
language
he
didn
t
speak
to
katzenberg
for
another
thirteen
year
job
be
furious
and
he
be
far
more
practice
than
lasseter
at
give
vent
to
his
emotion
he
call
katzenberg
and
start
yell
katzenberg
make
an
offer
he
would
delay
production
of
antz
if
job
and
disney
would
move
a
bug
s
life
so
that
it
didn
t
compete
with
prince
of
egypt
it
be
a
blatant
extortion
attempt
and
i
didn
t
go
for
it
job
recall
he
told
katzenberg
there
be
nothing
he
could
do
to
make
disney
change
the
release
date
of
course
you
can
katzenberg
reply
you
can
move
mountain
you
taught
me
how
he
say
that
when
pixar
be
almost
bankrupt
he
have
come
to
its
rescue
by
give
it
the
deal
to
do
toy
story
i
be
the
one
guy
there
for
you
back
then
and
now
you
re
allow
them
to
use
you
to
screw
me
he
suggest
that
if
job
want
to
he
could
simply
slow
down
production
on
a
bug
s
life
without
tell
disney
if
he
do
katzenberg
say
he
would
put
antz
on
hold
don
t
even
go
there
job
reply
katzenberg
have
a
valid
gripe
it
be
clear
that
eisner
and
disney
be
use
the
pixar
movie
to
get
back
at
him
for
leave
disney
and
start
a
rival
animation
studio
prince
of
egypt
be
the
first
thing
we
be
make
and
they
schedule
something
for
our
announce
release
date
just
to
be
hostile
he
say
my
view
be
like
that
of
the
lion
king
that
if
you
stick
your
hand
in
my
cage
and
paw
me
watch
out
no
one
back
down
and
the
rival
ant
movie
provoke
a
press
frenzy
disney
try
to
keep
job
quiet
on
the
theory
that
play
up
the
rivalry
would
serve
to
help
antz
but
he
be
a
man
not
easily
muzzle
the
bad
guy
rarely
win
he
told
the
los
angeles
time
in
response
dreamworks
savvy
marketing
maven
terry
press
suggest
steve
job
should
take
a
pill
antz
be
release
at
the
begin
of
october
it
be
not
a
bad
movie
woody
allen
voiced
the
part
of
a
neurotic
ant
living
in
a
conformist
society
who
yearns
to
express
his
individualism
this
be
the
kind
of
woody
allen
comedy
woody
allen
no
longer
make
time
write
it
gross
a
respectable
million
domestically
and
million
worldwide
a
bug
s
life
come
out
six
week
later
as
plan
it
have
a
more
epic
plot
which
reverse
aesop
s
tale
of
the
ant
and
the
grasshopper
plus
a
great
technical
virtuosity
which
allow
such
startle
detail
as
the
view
of
grass
from
a
bug
s
vantage
point
time
be
much
more
effusive
about
it
its
design
work
be
so
stellar
a
wide
screen
eden
of
leaf
and
labyrinth
populate
by
dozen
of
ugly
buggy
cuddly
cutups
that
it
make
the
dreamworks
film
seem
by
comparison
like
radio
write
richard
corliss
it
do
twice
as
well
as
antz
at
the
box
office
gross
million
domestically
and
million
worldwide
it
also
beat
prince
of
egypt
a
few
year
later
katzenberg
ran
into
job
and
try
to
smooth
thing
over
he
insist
that
he
have
never
heard
the
pitch
for
a
bug
s
life
while
at
disney
if
he
have
his
settlement
with
disney
would
have
give
him
a
share
of
the
profit
so
it
s
not
something
he
would
lie
about
job
laugh
and
accepted
as
much
i
ask
you
to
move
your
release
date
and
you
wouldn
t
so
you
can
t
be
mad
at
me
for
protect
my
child
katzenberg
told
him
he
recall
that
job
get
really
calm
and
zen
like
and
say
he
understood
but
job
later
say
that
he
never
really
forgave
katzenberg
our
film
toast
his
at
the
box
office
do
that
feel
good
no
it
still
felt
awful
because
people
start
say
how
everyone
in
hollywood
be
do
insect
movie
he
take
the
brilliant
originality
away
from
john
and
that
can
never
be
replace
that
s
unconscionable
so
i
ve
never
trust
him
even
after
he
try
to
make
amends
he
come
up
to
me
after
he
be
successful
with
shrek
and
say
i
m
a
change
man
i
m
finally
at
peace
with
myself
and
all
this
crap
and
it
be
like
give
me
a
break
jeffrey
for
his
part
katzenberg
be
much
more
gracious
he
consider
job
one
of
the
true
genius
in
the
world
and
he
learn
to
respect
him
despite
their
volatile
dealing
more
important
than
beating
antz
be
show
that
pixar
be
not
a
one
hit
wonder
a
bug
s
life
gross
as
much
as
toy
story
have
prove
that
the
first
success
be
not
a
fluke
there
s
a
classic
thing
in
business
which
be
the
second
product
syndrome
job
later
say
it
come
from
not
understand
what
make
your
first
product
so
successful
i
live
through
that
at
apple
my
feel
be
if
we
get
through
our
second
film
we
d
make
it
steve
s
own
movie
toy
story
which
come
out
in
november
be
even
big
with
a
million
gross
worldwide
give
that
pixar
s
success
be
now
assure
it
be
time
to
start
building
a
showcase
headquarters
job
and
the
pixar
facility
team
found
an
abandon
del
monte
fruit
cannery
in
emeryville
an
industrial
neighborhood
between
berkeley
and
oakland
just
across
the
bay
bridge
from
san
francisco
they
tore
it
down
and
job
commission
peter
bohlin
the
architect
of
the
apple
store
to
design
a
new
building
for
the
sixteen
acre
plot
job
obsess
over
every
aspect
of
the
new
building
from
the
overall
concept
to
the
tiniest
detail
regard
material
and
construction
steve
have
this
firm
belief
that
the
right
kind
of
building
can
do
great
thing
for
a
culture
say
pixar
s
president
ed
catmull
job
control
the
creation
of
the
building
as
if
he
be
a
director
sweat
each
scene
of
a
film
the
pixar
building
be
steve
s
own
movie
lasseter
say
lasseter
have
originally
want
a
traditional
hollywood
studio
with
separate
building
for
various
project
and
bungalow
for
development
team
but
the
disney
folk
say
they
didn
t
like
their
new
campus
because
the
team
felt
isolated
and
job
agree
in
fact
he
decide
they
should
go
to
the
other
extreme
one
huge
building
around
a
central
atrium
design
to
encourage
random
encounter
despite
be
a
denizen
of
the
digital
world
or
maybe
because
he
knew
all
too
well
its
isolate
potential
job
be
a
strong
believer
in
face
to
face
meeting
there
s
a
temptation
in
our
networked
age
to
think
that
idea
can
be
developed
by
email
and
ichat
he
say
that
s
crazy
creativity
come
from
spontaneous
meeting
from
random
discussion
you
run
into
someone
you
ask
what
they
re
do
you
say
wow
and
soon
you
re
cooking
up
all
sort
of
idea
so
he
have
the
pixar
building
design
to
promote
encounter
and
unplanned
collaboration
if
a
building
doesn
t
encourage
that
you
ll
lose
a
lot
of
innovation
and
the
magic
that
s
spark
by
serendipity
he
say
so
we
design
the
building
to
make
people
get
out
of
their
office
and
mingle
in
the
central
atrium
with
people
they
might
not
otherwise
see
the
front
door
and
main
stair
and
corridor
all
lead
to
the
atrium
the
caf
and
the
mailbox
be
there
the
conference
room
have
window
that
look
out
onto
it
and
the
six
hundred
seat
theater
and
two
small
screen
room
all
spill
into
it
steve
s
theory
work
from
day
one
lasseter
recall
i
kept
run
into
people
i
hadn
t
see
for
month
i
ve
never
see
a
building
that
promote
collaboration
and
creativity
as
well
as
this
one
job
even
go
so
far
as
to
decree
that
there
be
only
two
huge
bathroom
in
the
building
one
for
each
gender
connect
to
the
atrium
he
felt
that
very
very
strongly
recall
pam
kerwin
pixar
s
general
manager
some
of
us
felt
that
be
go
too
far
one
pregnant
woman
say
she
shouldn
t
be
force
to
walk
for
ten
minute
just
to
go
to
the
bathroom
and
that
lead
to
a
big
fight
it
be
one
of
the
few
time
that
lasseter
disagreed
with
job
they
reach
a
compromise
there
would
be
two
set
of
bathroom
on
either
side
of
the
atrium
on
both
of
the
two
floor
because
the
building
s
steel
beam
be
go
to
be
visible
job
pore
over
sample
from
manufacturer
across
the
country
to
see
which
have
the
best
color
and
texture
he
chose
a
mill
in
arkansas
told
it
to
blast
the
steel
to
a
pure
color
and
make
sure
the
trucker
use
caution
not
to
nick
any
of
it
he
also
insist
that
all
the
beam
be
bolt
together
not
weld
we
sandblast
the
steel
and
clear
coat
it
so
you
can
actually
see
what
it
s
like
he
recall
when
the
steelworker
be
put
up
the
beam
they
would
bring
their
family
on
the
weekend
to
show
them
the
wacky
piece
of
serendipity
be
the
love
lounge
one
of
the
animator
found
a
small
door
on
the
back
wall
when
he
move
into
his
office
it
open
to
a
low
corridor
that
you
could
crawl
through
to
a
room
clad
in
sheet
metal
that
provide
access
to
the
air
conditioning
valve
he
and
his
colleague
commandeer
the
secret
room
festoon
it
with
christmas
light
and
lava
lamp
and
furnish
it
with
bench
upholstered
in
animal
print
tasseled
pillow
a
fold
up
cocktail
table
liquor
bottle
bar

and
job
brought
important
visitor
there
and
have
them
sign

the
signature
include
michael
eisner
roy
disney
tim
allen
and
randy
newman
job
love
it
but
since
he
wasn
t
a
drinker
he
sometimes
refer
to
it
as
the
meditation
room
it
remind
him
he
say
of
the
one
that
he
and
daniel
kottke
have
at
reed
but
without
the
acid
the
divorce
in
testimony
before
a

committee
in
february
michael
eisner
blast
the

that
job

computer
company
that
have

burn
he
declare
in
other
word
they
can
create
a
theft
and
distribute
it
to
all
their
friend
if
they
buy
this
particular
computer
this
be
not
a
smart
comment
it
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
rip
and
assume
it
involve
rip
someone
off
rather
than
import
file
from
a
cd
to
a
computer
more
significantly
it
truly
piss
off
job
as
eisner
should
have
know
that
too
be
not
smart
pixar
have
recently
release
the
fourth
movie
in
its
disney
deal
monster
inc
which
turn
out
to
be
the
most
successful
of
them
all
with
million
in
worldwide
gross
disney
s
pixar
deal
be
again
come
up
for
renewal
and
eisner
have
not
make
it
easy
by
publicly
poke
a
stick
at
his
partner
s
eye
job
be
so
incredulous
he
call
a
disney
executive
to
vent
do
you
know
what
michael
just
do
to
me
eisner
and
job
come
from
different
background
and
opposite
coast
but
they
be
similar
in
be
strong
will
and
without
much
inclination
to
find
compromise
they
both
have
a
passion
for
make
good
product
which
often
meant
micromanaging
detail
and
not
sugarcoat
their
criticism
watch
eisner
take
repeat
ride
on
the
wildlife
express
train
through
disney
world
s
animal
kingdom
and
come
up
with
smart
way
to
improve
the
customer
experience
be
like
watch
job
play
with
the
interface
of
an
ipod
and
find
way
it
could
be
simplify
watch
them
manage
people
be
a
less
edify
experience
both
be
well
at
push
people
than
be
push
which
lead
to
an
unpleasant
atmosphere
when
they
start
try
to
do
it
to
each
other
in
a
disagreement
they
tend
to
assert
that
the
other
party
be
lie
in
addition
neither
eisner
nor
job
seem
to
believe
that
he
could
learn
anything
from
the
other
nor
would
it
have
occur
to
either
even
to
fake
a
bit
of
deference
by
pretend
to
have
anything
to
learn
job
put
the
onus
on
eisner
the
bad
thing
to
my
mind
be
that
pixar
have
successfully
reinvent
disney
s
business
turn
out
great
film
one
after
the
other
while
disney
turn
out
flop
after
flop
you
would
think
the
ceo
of
disney
would
be
curious
how
pixar
be
do
that
but
during
the
twenty
year
relationship
he
visit
pixar
for
a
total
of
about
two
and
a
half
hour
only
to
give
little
congratulatory
speech
he
be
never
curious
i
be
amaze
curiosity
be
very
important
that
be
overly
harsh
eisner
have
be
up
to
pixar
a
bit
more
than
that
include
visit
when
job
wasn
t
with
him
but
it
be
true
that
he
show
little
curiosity
about
the
artistry
or
technology
at
the
studio
job
likewise
didn
t
spend
much
time
try
to
learn
from
disney
s
management
the
open
snip
between
job
and
eisner
begin
in
the
summer
of
job
have
always
admire
the
creative
spirit
of
the
great
walt
disney
especially
because
he
have
nurture
a
company
to
last
for
generation
he
view
walt
s
nephew
roy
as
an
embodiment
of
this
historic
legacy
and
spirit
roy
be
still
on
the
disney
board
despite
his
own
grow
estrangement
from
eisner
and
job
let
him
know
that
he
would
not
renew
the
pixar
disney
deal
as
long
as
eisner
be
still
the
ceo
roy
disney
and
stanley
gold
his
close
associate
on
the
disney
board
begin
warn
other
director
about
the
pixar
problem
that
prompt
eisner
to
send
the
board
an
intemperate
email
in
late
august
he
be
confident
that
pixar
would
eventually
renew
its
deal
he
say
partly
because
disney
have
right
to
the
pixar
movie
and
character
that
have
be
make
thus
far
plus
he
say
disney
would
be
in
a
well
negotiate
position
in
a
year
after
pixar
finish
find
nemo
yesterday
we
saw
for
the
second
time
the
new
pixar
movie
find
nemo
that
come
out
next
may
he
write
this
will
be
a
reality
check
for
those
guy
it
s
okay
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
their
previous
film
of
course
they
think
it
be
great
there
be
two
major
problem
with
this
email
it
leak
to
the
los
angeles
time
provoke
job
to
go
ballistic
and
eisner
s
assessment
of
the
movie
be
wrong
very
wrong
find
nemo
become
pixar
s
and
disney
s
big
hit
thus
far
it
easily
beat
out
the
lion
king
to
become
for
the
time
be
the
most
successful
animate
movie
in
history
it
gross
million
domestically
and
million
worldwide
until
it
be
also
the
most
popular
dvd
of
all
time
with
forty
million
copy
sell
and
spawn
some
of
the
most
popular
ride
at
disney
theme
park
in
addition
it
be
a
richly
textured
subtle
and
deeply
beautiful
artistic
achievement
that
won
the
oscar
for
best
animate
feature
i
like
the
film
because
it
be
about
take
risk
and
learn
to
let
those
you
love
take
risk
job
say
its
success
add
million
to
pixar
s
cash
reserve
give
it
a
hefty
war
chest
of
million
for
the
final
showdown
with
disney
shortly
after
find
nemo
be
finish
job
make
eisner
an
offer
that
be
so
one
side
it
be
clearly
meant
to
be
reject
instead
of
a
fifty
fifty
split
on
revenue
as
in
the
exist
deal
job
propose
a
new
arrangement
in
which
pixar
would
own
outright
the
film
it
make
and
the
character
in
them
and
it
would
merely
pay
disney
a
fee
to
distribute
the
movie
plus
the
last
two
film
under
the
exist
deal
the
incredibles
and
car
be
the
one
in
the
work
would
shift
to
the
new
distribution
deal
eisner
however
held
one
powerful
trump
card
even
if
pixar
didn
t
renew
disney
have
the
right
to
make
sequel
of
toy
story
and
the
other
movie
that
pixar
have
make
and
it
own
all
the
character
from
woody
to
nemo
just
as
it
own
mickey
mouse
and
donald
duck
eisner
be
already
planning
or
threaten
to
have
disney
s
own
animation
studio
do
a
toy
story
which
pixar
have
decline
to
do
when
you
see
what
that
company
do
put
out
cinderella
ii
you
shudder
at
what
would
have
happen
job
say
eisner
be
able
to
force
roy
disney
off
the
board
in
november
but
that
didn
t
end
the
turmoil
disney
release
a
scathing
open
letter
the
company
have
lose
its
focus
its
creative
energy
and
its
heritage
he
write
his
litany
of
eisner
s
allege
failing
include
not
building
a
constructive
relationship
with

by
this
point
job
have
decide
that
he
no
longer
want
to
work
with
eisner
so
in
january
he
publicly
announce
that
he
be
cut
off
negotiation
with

public
the
strong
opinion
that
he
share
with
friend
around
his
palo

this
time

scoffed
at
eisner
s
notion
that

any
creative
contribution

the
truth

there

little
creative
collaboration
with

for
year

can
compare

with
the
creative
quality
of

last
three
film

creative
ability

by
announce
that
he
be
end
talk
with
us
iger
later
recall
we
go
into
crisis
mode
and
i
developed
some
talk
point
to
settle
thing
down
eisner
have
preside
over
ten
great
year
at
disney
when
frank
well
serve
as
his
president
well
freed
eisner
from
many
management
duty
so
he
could
make
his
suggestion
usually
valuable
and
often
brilliant
on
way
to
improve
each
movie
project
theme
park
ride
television
pilot
and
countless
other
product
but
after
well
be
kill
in
a
helicopter
crash
in
eisner
never
found
the
right
manager
katzenberg
have
demand
well
s
job
which
be
why
eisner
oust
him
michael
ovitz
become
president
in
it
be
not
a
pretty
sight
and
he
be
go
in
less
than
two
year
job
later
offer
his
assessment
for
his
first
ten
year
as
ceo
eisner
do
a
really
good
job
for
the
last
ten
year
he
really
do
a
bad
job
and
the
change
come
when
frank
well
die
eisner
be
a
really
good
creative
guy
he
give
really
good
note
so
when
frank
be
run
operation
eisner
could
be
like
a
bumblebee
go
from
project
to
project
try
to
make
them
well
but
when
eisner
have
to
run
thing
he
be
a
terrible
manager
nobody
like
work
for
him
they
felt
they
have
no
authority
he
have
this
strategic
planning
group
that
be
like
the
gestapo
in
that
you
couldn
t
spend
any
money
not
even
a
dime
without
them
approve
it
even
though
i
broke
with
him
i
have
to
respect
his
achievement
in
the
first
ten
year
and
there
be
a
part
of
him
i
actually
like
he
s
a
fun
guy
to
be
around
at
time
smart
witty
but
he
have
a
dark
side
to
him
his
ego
get
the
well
of
him
eisner
be
reasonable
and
fair
to
me
at
first
but
eventually
over
the
course
of
deal
with
him
for
a
decade
i
come
to
see
a
dark
side
to
him
eisner
s
big
problem
in
be
that
he
do
not
fully
fathom
how
mess
up
his
animation
division
be
its
two
most
recent
movie
treasure
planet
and
brother
bear
do
no
honor
to
the
disney
legacy
or
to
its
balance
sheet
hit

t
understand
that
disney
s
problem
in
animation
be
as
acute
as
they
be
iger
later
explain
that
manifest
itself
in
the
way
he
dealt
with
pixar
he
never
felt
he
need
pixar
as
much
as
he
really
do
in
addition
eisner
love
to
negotiate
and
hat
to
compromise
which
be
not
always
the
best
combination
when

who
be
the
same
way
every
negotiation
need
to
be
resolve
by
compromise
iger
say
neither
one
of
them
be
a
master
of
compromise
the
impasse
be
end
on
a
saturday
night
in

thrill
he
like

a
small
connection
they

to
sell
and
job
do
not
want
to
be
too
public
in
negotiate
for
them
because
as
usual
he

until
he
unveiled
it
onstage
iger

so
i
have
no
idea
what
a
big
deal
it
be
iger
recall
it
be
a
real
breakthrough
for
our
relationship
he
saw
i
be
pro
technology
and
willing
to
take
risk
job
do
his
usual
virtuoso
performance
run
through
all
the

film
then
as
be
his
habit
he
end
with

yes
there
be
one
more
thing

exult
when
iger
then
come
onstage
he
look
as
relaxed
and
as
comfortable
as
job
one
of
the
thing
that
steve
and
i
be
incredibly
excite
about
be
the
intersection
between
great
content
and
great
technology
he
say
it
s
great
to
be
here
to
announce
an
extension
of
our
relation
with
apple
he
add
then
after
the
proper
pause
he
say
not
with
pixar
but
with
apple
but
it
be
clear
from
their
warm
embrace
that
a
new
pixar
disney
deal
be
once
again
possible
it
signal
my
way
of
operating
which
be
make
love
not
war
iger
recall
we
have
be
at
war
with
roy
disney
comcast
apple
and
pixar
i
want
to
fix
all
that
pixar
most
of
all
iger
have
just
come
back
from
opening
the
new
disneyland
in
hong
kong
with
eisner
at
his
side
in
his
last
big
act
as
ceo
the
ceremony
include
the
usual
disney
parade
down
main
street
iger
realize
that
the
only
character
in
the
parade
that
have
be
create
in
the
past
decade
be
pixar
s
a
lightbulb
go
off
he
recall
i
m
stand
next
to
michael
but
i
kept
it
completely
to
myself
because
it
be
such
an
indictment
of
his
stewardship
of
animation
during
that
period
after
ten
year
of
the
lion
king
beauty
and
the
beast
and
aladdin
there
be
then
ten
year
of
nothing
iger
go
back
to
burbank
and
have
some
financial
analysis
do
he
discover
that
they
have
actually
lose
money
on
animation
in
the
past
decade
and
have
produce
little
that
help
ancillary
product
at
his
first
meeting
as
the
new
ceo
he
present
the
analysis
to
the
board
whose
member
express
some
anger
that
they
have
never
be
told
this
as
animation
go
so
go
our
company
he
told
the
board
a
hit
animate
film
be
a
big
wave
and
the
ripple
go
down
to
every
part
of
our
business
from
character
in
a
parade
to
music
to
park
to
video
game
tv
internet
consumer
product
if
i
don
t
have
wave
maker
the
company
be
not
go
to
succeed
he
present
them
with
some
choice
they
could
stick
with
the
current
animation
management
which
he
didn
t
think
would
work
they
could
get
rid
of
management
and
find
someone
else
but
he
say
he
didn
t
know
who
that
would
be
or
they
could
buy
pixar
the
problem
be
i
don
t
know
if
it
s
for
sale
and
if
it
be
it
s
go
to
be
a
huge
amount
of
money
he
say
the
board
authorize
him
to
explore
a
deal
iger
go
about
it
in
an
unusual
way
when
he
first
talk
to
job
he
admit
the
revelation
that
have
occur
to
him
in
hong
kong
and
how
it
convince
him
that
disney
badly
need
pixar
that
s
why
i
just
love
bob
iger
recall
job
he
just
blurt
it
out
now
that
s
the
dumbest
thing
you
can
do
as
you
enter
a
negotiation
at
least
accord
to
the
traditional
rule
book
he
just
put
his
card
out
on
the
table
and
say
we
re
screw
i
immediately
like
the
guy
because
that
s
how
i
work
too
let
s
just
immediately
put
all
the
card
on
the
table
and
see
where
they
fall
in
fact
that
be
not
usually
job
s
mode
of
operation
he
often
begin
negotiation
by
proclaim
that
the
other
company
s
product
or
service
suck
job
and
iger
take
a
lot
of
walk
around
the
apple
campus
in
palo
alto
at
the
allen
and
co
retreat
in
sun
valley
at
first
they
come
up
with
a
plan
for
a
new
distribution
deal
pixar
would
get
back
all
the
right
to
the
movie
and
character
it
have
already
produce
in
return
for
disney
s
get
an
equity
stake
in
pixar
and
it
would
pay
disney
a
simple
fee
to
distribute
its
future
movie
but
iger
worried
that
such
a
deal
would
simply
set
pixar
up
as
a
competitor
to
disney
which
would
be
bad
even
if
disney
have
an
equity
stake
in
it
so
he
begin
to
hint
that
maybe
they
should
actually
do
something
big
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
be
really
think
out
of
the
box
on
this
he
say
job
seem
to
encourage
the
advance
it
wasn
t
too
long
before
it
be
clear
to
both
of
us
that
this
discussion
might
lead
to
an
acquisition
discussion
job
recall
but
first
job
need
the
blessing
of
john
lasseter
and
ed
catmull
so
he
ask
them
to
come
over
to
his
house
he
get
right
to
the
point
we
need
to
get
to
know
bob
iger
he
told
them
we
may
want
to
throw
in
with
him
and
to
help
him
remake
disney
he
s
a
great
guy
they
be
skeptical
at
first
he
could
tell
we
be
pretty
shock
lasseter
recall
if
you
guy
don
t
want
to
do
it
that
s
fine
but
i
want
you
to
get
to
know
iger
before
you
decide
job
continued
i
be
feel
the
same
as
you
but
i
ve
really
grown
to
like
the
guy
he
explain
how
easy
it
have
be
to
make
the
deal
to
put
abc
show
on
the
ipod
and
add
it
s
night
and
day
different
from
eisner
s
disney
he
s
straightforward
and
there
s
no
drama
with
him
lasseter
remembers
that
he
and
catmull
just
sat
there
with
their
mouth
slightly
open
iger
go
to
work

flew
from
los

no
entourage
and
without
job
i
go
out
and
met
all
the
director
one
on
one
and
they
each

me
their
movie
he
say
lasseter
be
proud
of
how
much
his
team
impressed
iger
which
of
course
make
him
warm
up
to
iger
i
never
have
more
pride
in
pixar
than
that
day
he
say
all
the
team
and
pitch
be
amaze
and
bob
be
blown
away
indeed
after

up
over

deal
they
propose

goal
be
to
make
them
feel
comfortable
with
what
would
be
a
radical
and
expensive
deal
as
they
prepared

garage
lasseter
say
to
job
if
i
start
get
too

or
go
on
too
long
just
touch
my
leg
job
end
up
have
to
do
it
once
but
otherwise
lasseter
make
the
perfect
sale
pitch
i
talk
about
how
we
make
film
what
our
philosophy
be
the
honesty
we
have
with
each
other
and
how
we
nurture
the
creative
talent
he
recall
the
board
ask
a
lot
of
question
and
job
let
lasseter
answer
most
but
job
do
talk
about
how
excite
it
be
to
connect
art
with
technology
that
s
what
our
culture
be
all
about
just
like
at
apple
he
say
before
the
disney
board
get
a
chance
to
approve
the
merger
however
michael
eisner
arose
from
the
depart
to
try
to
derail
it
he
call
iger
and
say
it
be
far
too
expensive
you
can
fix
animation
yourself
eisner
told
him
how
ask
iger
i
know
you
can
say
eisner
iger
get
a
bit
annoyed
michael
how
come
you
say
i
can
fix
it
when
you
couldn
t
fix
it
yourself
he
ask
eisner
say
he
want
to
come
to
a
board
meeting
even
though
he
be
no
longer
a
member
or
an
officer
and
speak
against
the
acquisition
iger
resist
but
eisner
call
warren
buffett
a
big
shareholder
and
george
mitchell
who
be
the
lead
director
the
former
senator
convince
iger
to
let
eisner
have
his
say
i
told
the
board
that
they
didn
t
need
to
buy
pixar
because
they
already
own
of
the
movie
pixar
have
already
make
eisner
recount
he
be
refer
to
the
fact
that
for
the
movie
already
make
disney
be
get
that
percentage
of
the
gross
plus
it
have
the
right
to
make
all
the
sequel
and
exploit
the
character
i
make
a
presentation
that
say
here
s
the
of
pixar
that
disney
do
not
already
own
so
that
s
what
you
re
get
the
rest
be
a
bet
on
future
pixar
film
eisner
admit
that
pixar
have
be
enjoy
a
good
run
but
he
say
it
could
not
continue
i
show
the
history
of
producer
and
director
who
have
x
number
of
hit
in
a
row
and
then
fail
it
happen
to
spielberg
walt
disney
all
of
them
to
make
the
deal
worth
it
he
calculate
each
new
pixar
movie
would
have
to
gross
billion
it
drove
steve
crazy
that
i
knew
that
eisner
later
say
after
he
left
the
room
iger
refute
his
argument
point
by
point
let
me
tell
you
what
be
wrong
with
that
presentation
he
begin
when
the
board
have
finish
hearing
them
both
it
approve
the
deal
iger
propose
iger
flew
up
to
emeryville
to
meet
job
and
jointly
announce
the
deal
to
the
pixar
worker
but
before
they
do
job
sat
down
alone
with
lasseter
and
catmull
if
either
of
you
have
doubt
he
say
i
will
just
tell
them
no
thanks
and
blow
off
this
deal
he
wasn
t
totally
sincere
it
would
have
be
almost
impossible
to
do
so
at
that
point
but
it
be
a
welcome
gesture
i
m
good
say
lasseter
let
s
do
it
catmull
agree
they
all
hug
and
job
wept
everyone
then
gather
in
the
atrium
disney
be
buying
pixar
job
announce
there
be
a
few
tear
but
as
he
explain
the
deal
the
staffer
begin
to
realize
that
in
some
way
it
be
a
reverse
acquisition
catmull
would
be
the
head
of
disney
animation
lasseter
its
chief
creative
officer
by
the
end
they
be
cheer
iger
have
be
stand
on
the
side
and
job
invite
him
to
center
stage
as
he
talk
about
the
special
culture
of
pixar
and
how
badly
disney
need
to
nurture
it
and
learn
from
it
the
crowd
broke
into
applause
my
goal
have
always
be
not
only
to
make
great
product
but
to
build
great
company
job
later
say
walt
disney
do
that
and
the
way
we
do
the
merger
we
kept
pixar
as
a
great
company
and
help
disney
remain
one

it

the

job
later

that
he
have
overdesigned
and
overprice
the

as
he
have
the

gradually
he
be
learn
his
lesson
in
building
device
like
the

he
would
control
cost
and
make
the
trade
offs
necessary
to
get
them
launch
on
time
and
on

partly
because
of
the
poor
sale
of
the
cube
apple
produce
disappoint
revenue
number
in

that

when
the

decline
the

fell
in

day
and
by
early
december
it
be
below
none
of
this
deter
job
from
continue
to
push
for
distinctive
even
distract
new
design
when
flat

display
become
commercially
viable
he
decide
it
be
time
to
replace
the

the
translucent
consumer
desktop
computer
that
look
as
if
it
be
from
a
jetsons
cartoon
ive
come
up
with
a
model
that
be
somewhat
conventional
with
the
gut
of
the
computer
attach
to
the
back
of
the
flat
screen
job
didn
t
like
it
as
he
often
do
both
at
pixar
and
at
apple
he
slam
on
the
brake
to
rethink
thing
there
be
something
about
the
design
that
lack
purity
he
felt
why
have
this
flat
display
if
you
re
go
to
glom
all
this
stuff
on
its
back
he
ask
ive
we
should
let
each
element
be
true
to
itself
job
go
home
early
that
day
to
mull
over
the
problem
then
call
ive
to
come
by
they
wander
into
the
garden
which
job
s
wife
have
plant
with
a
profusion
of
sunflower
every
year
i
do
something
wild
with
the
garden
and
that
time
it
involve
mass
of
sunflower
with
a
sunflower
house
for
the
kid
she
recall
jony
and
steve
be
riff
on
their
design
problem
then
jony
ask
what
if
the
screen
be
separate
from
the
base
like
a
sunflower
he
get
excite
and
start
sketch
ive
like
his
design
to
suggest
a
narrative
and
he
realize
that
a
sunflower
shape
would
convey
that
the
flat
screen
be
so
fluid
and
responsive
that
it
could
reach
for
the
sun
in
ive
s
new
design
the
mac
s
screen
be
attach
to
a
movable
chrome
neck
so
that
it
look
not
only
like
a
sunflower
but
also
like
a
cheeky
luxo
lamp
indeed
it
evoke
the
playful
personality
of
luxo
jr
in
the
first
short
film
that
john
lasseter
have
make
at
pixar
apple
take
out
many
patent
for
the
design
most
credit
ive
but
on
one
of
them
for
a
computer
system
have
a
movable
assembly
attach
to
a
flat
panel
display
job
list
himself
as
the
primary
inventor
in
hindsight
some
of
apple
s
macintosh
design
may
seem
a
bit
too
cute
but
other
computer
maker
be
at
the
other
extreme
it
be
an
industry
that
you
d
expect
to
be
innovative
but
instead
it
be
dominate
by
cheaply
design
generic
box
after
a
few
ill
conceive
stab
at

try
new

such
as

by

and
compete
on
price
with
its
spunky

apple

about
the

place
innovate
intel
inside
apple

be
more
than

the

that
be
make
by
a
partnership
of

and
motorola
for
a
few
year
it
be
faster
than

an
advantage
that
apple
tout
in
humorous
commercial
by
the
time
of

return
however
motorola
have
fall

right
after
his
return
to

he

to
galvin
that
he
might
consider
make
an
exception
for
motorola

clone
the
starmax

but
only
if
motorola
speed
up

the

offer
his

suck
galvin
who
also
have
a
temper
push
back

hung
up
on
him
the

secretly
begin

to
move
apple
off
the
motorola
ibm
powerpc

and
to
adopt
instead
intel
s
this
would
not
be
a
simple
task
it
be
akin
to
write
a
new
operating
system
job
do
not
cede
any
real
power
to
his
board
but
he
do
use
its
meeting
to
kick
around
idea
and
think
through
strategy
in
confidence
while
he
stood
at
a
whiteboard
and
lead
freewheel
discussion
for
eighteen
month
the
director
discuss
whether
to
move

an
intel
architecture
we
debate
it
we
ask
a
lot
of
question

finally
we
all
decide
it
need
to
be
do
board

art
levinson
recall
paul
otellini
who
be
then

begin
huddle
with
job
they
have
gotten
to
know
each
other
when
job
be
struggle
to
keep
next
alive
and
as
otellini
later
put
it
his
arrogance
have
be
temporarily
temper
otellini
have
a
calm
and
wry
take
on
people
and
he
be
amuse
rather
than
put
off

i
ask
him
about
job

accomplishment
they
basically
do
that
option
among
job

be
his
attitude
toward

when
he
return

for
a

do
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
rather
than

he
embrace
the
idea

he
have
stun
woolard
by
ask
for
even
more

the

have
propose

soon
after

yet
he
have
become
the
poster
child
of
greedy
ceo
make
him
look
hypocritical
and
undermine
his
self
image
he
write
a
scathing
letter
to
the
editor
declare
that
his
option
actually
be
worth
zero
and
offering
to
sell
them
to
fortune
for
half
of
the
suppose
million
the
magazine
have
report
in
the
meantime
job
want
the
board
to
give
him
another
big
grant
of
option
since
his
old
one
seem
worthless
he
insist
both
to
the
board
and
probably
to
himself
that
it
be
more
about
get
proper
recognition
than
get
rich
it
wasn
t
so
much
about
the
money
he
later
say
in
a
deposition
in
an
sec
lawsuit
over
the
option
everybody
like
to
be
recognize
by
his
peer
i
felt
that
the
board
wasn
t
really
do
the
same
with
me
he
felt
that
the
board
should
have
come
to
him
offering
a
new
grant
without
his
have
to
suggest
it
i
thought
i
be
do
a
pretty
good
job
it
would
have
make
me
feel
well
at
the
time
his
handpicked
board
in
fact
dot
on
him
so
they
decide
to
give
him
another
huge
grant
in
august
when
the
stock
price
be
just
under
the
problem
be
that
he
worried
about
his
image
especially
after
the
fortune
article
he
do
not
want
to
accept
the
new
grant
unless
the
board
cancel
his
old
option
at
the
same
time
but
to
do
so
would
have
adverse
accounting
implication
because
it
would
be
effectively
repricing
the
old
option
that
would
require
take
a
charge
against
current
earnings
the
only
way
to
avoid
this
variable
accounting
problem
be
to
cancel
his
old
option
at
least
six
month
after
his
new
option
be
grant
in
addition
job
start
haggle
with
the
board
over
how
quickly
the
new
option
would
vest
it
be
not
until
mid
december
that
job
finally
agree
to
take
the
new
option
and
braving
the
optic
wait
six
month
before
his
old
one
be
cancel
but
by
then
the
stock
price
adjust
for
a
split
have
go
up
to
about
if
the
strike
price
of
the
new
option
be
set
at
that
new
level
each
would
have
thus
be
less
valuable
so
apple
s
legal
counsel
nancy
heinen
look
over
the
recent
stock
price
and
help
to
choose
an
october
date
when
the
stock
be
she
also
approve
a
set
of
minute
that
purport
to
show
that
the
board
have
approve
the
grant
on
that
date
the
backdating
be
potentially
worth
million
to
job
once
again
job
would
end
up
suffer
bad
publicity
without
make
a
penny
apple
s
stock
price
kept
drop
and
by
march
even
the
new
option
be
so
low
that
job
trade
in
all
of
them
for
an
outright
grant
of
million
worth
of
share
which
amount
to
about
million
for
each
year
he
have
work
since
come
back
in
through
the
end
of
the
vest
in
none
of
this
would
have
matter
much
if
the
wall
street
journal
have
not
run
a
powerful
series
in
about
backdate
stock
option
apple
wasn
t
mention
but
its
board
appoint
a
committee
of
three
member
al
gore
eric
schmidt
of
google
and
jerry
york
formerly
of
ibm
and
chrysler
to
investigate
its
own
practice
we
decide
at
the
outset
that
if
steve
be
at
fault
we
would
let
the
chip
fall
where
they
may
gore
recall
the
committee
uncovered
some
irregularity
with
job
s
grant
and
those
of
other
top
officer
and
it
immediately
turn
the
finding
over
to
the
sec
job
be
aware
of
the
backdating
the
report
say
but
he
end
up
not
benefiting
financially
a
board
committee
at
disney
also
found
that
similar
backdating
have
occur
at
pixar
when
job
be
in
charge
the
law
govern
such
backdating
practice
be
murky
especially
since
no
one
at
apple
end
up
benefiting
from
the
dubiously
date
grant
the
sec
take
eight
month
to
do
its
own
investigation
and
in
april
it
announce
that
it
would
not
bring
action
against
apple
base
in
part
on
its
swift
extensive
and
extraordinary
cooperation
in
the
commission
s
investigation
and
its
prompt
self
reporting
although
the
sec
found
that
job
have
be
aware
of
the
backdating
it
clear
him
of
any
misconduct
because
he
be
unaware
of
the
accounting
implication
the
sec
do
file
complaint
against
apple
s
former

not
the

people
around
him

he
also
want
to
have
huge

bestow
upon
him
jangling
inside
him
be
the

cancer
job
would
later
speculate
that
his
cancer
be
cause
by
the
grueling
year
that
he
spent
start
in
run
both
apple
and
pixar
as
he
drove
back
and
forth
he
have
developed
kidney
stone
and
other
ailment
and
he
would
come
home
so
exhaust
that
he
could
barely
speak
that
s
probably
when
this
cancer
start
grow
because
my
immune
system
be
pretty
weak
at
that
time
he
say
there
be
no
evidence
that
exhaustion
or
a
weak
immune
system
cause
cancer
however
his
kidney
problem
do
indirectly
lead
to
the
detection
of
his
cancer
in
october
he
happen
to
run
into
the
urologist
who
have
treat
him
and
she
ask
him
to
get
a
cat
scan
of
his
kidney
and
ureter
it
have
be
five
year
since
his
last
scan
the
new
scan
reveal
nothing
wrong
with
his
kidney
but
it
do
show
a
shadow
on
his
pancreas
so
she
ask
him
to
schedule
a
pancreatic
study
he
didn
t
as
usual
he
be
good
at
willfully
ignore
input
that
he
do
not
want
to
process
but
she
persist
steve
this
be
really
important
she

a
few
day
later
you
need
to
do
this
her
tone
of

be
urgent
enough
that
he
comply
he
go
in
early
one
morning
and
after
study
the

the
doctor
met
with
him
to
deliver
the
bad
news
that
it
be
a

one

even
suggest

should
make
sure
his

be
in

a
polite
way
of
say
that
he
might
have
only
month
to
live
that
even
they
perform
a
biopsy
by
stick
an
endoscope
down
his
throat
and
into
his
intestine
so
they
could
put
a
needle
into
his

get
a

cell
from
the
tumor
powell

her
husband

i
really
didn

i
try

that
stress
the
use

fast
frequent
bowel
cleansing
hydrotherapy
and
the
expression

the
big
thing
be
that
he
really
be
not
ready
to
open
his

powell
recall
it
s
hard
to
push
someone

that
she
do
try
however
the

exists
to
serve
the

told
him
job
s
obstinacy
last
for
nine
month
after
his

part
of
it
be
the
product
of
the
dark
side
of
his
reality
distortion
field
i
think
steve
have
such
a
strong
desire
for
the

a
certain
way

it
doesn
t
work
reality
be
unforgiving
the
flip
side
of
his
wondrous
ability
to
focus
be
his
fearsome
willingness
to
filter
out
thing
he
do
not
wish
to
deal
with
this
lead
to
many
of
his
great
breakthrough

it
could
also
backfire
he
have
that
ability

ignore

he
doesn
t
want
to
confront
powell

the
way
he

weird
routine
of
purge

that

job
have
never
do
this
and
he
never
would
he
stayed
in
the
hospital
for
two
week
and
then
struggle
to
regain
his
strength
i
remember
come
back
and
sit
in
that
rock
chair
he
told
me
point
to
one
in
his
living
room
i
didn
t
have
the
energy
to
walk
it
take
me
a
week
before
i
could
walk
around
the
block
i
push
myself
to
walk
to
the
garden
a
few
block
away
then
far
and
within
six
month
i
have
my
energy
almost
back
unfortunately
the
cancer
have
spread
during
the
operation
the
doctor
found
three
liver
metastasis
have
they
operate
nine
month
earlier
they
might
have
caught
it
before
it
spread
though
they
would
never
know
for
sure
job
begin
chemotherapy
treatment
which
far
complicate
his
eat
challenge
the
stanford

kept
his
continue
battle
with
the
cancer
secret

that
he
have
be
cure
just
as
he
have
kept
quiet
about
his
diagnosis
in
october
such
secrecy
be
not
surprising
it
be
part
of
his
nature
what
be
more
surprising
be
his
decision
to
speak
very
personally
and
publicly
about
his
cancer
diagnosis
although
he
rarely
give
speech
other
than
his
stag
product
demonstration
he
accepted
stanford
s
invitation
to
give
its
june
commencement
address
he
be
in
a
reflective
mood
after
his
health

and
turn
fifty
for
help
with
the
speech
he
call
the
brilliant

aaron
sorkin
a
few
good
men
the
west
wing
job
sent
him
some
thought
that
be
in
february
and
i
heard
nothing
so
i
ping
him
again
in
april
and
he
say
oh
yeah
and
i
send
him
a
few
more
thought
job
recount
i
finally
get
him
on
the
phone
and
he
keep
say
yeah
but
finally
it
s
the
begin
of
june
and
he
never
sent
me
anything
job
get
panicky
he
have
always
write
his
own
presentation
but
he
have
never
do
a
commencement
address
one
night
he
sat
down
and
write
the
speech
himself
with
no
help
other
than
bounce
idea
off
his
wife
as
a
result
it
turn
out
to
be
a
very
intimate
and
simple
talk
with
the
unadorned
and
personal
feel
of
a
perfect
steve
job
product
alex
haley
once
say
that
the
best
way
to
begin
a
speech
be
let
me
tell
you
a
story
nobody
be
eager
for
a
lecture
but
everybody
love
a
story
and
that
be
the
approach
job
chose
today
i
want
to
tell
you
three
story
from
my
life
he
begin
that
s
it
no
big
deal
just
three
story
the
first
be
about
drop
out
of
reed
college
i
could
stop
take
the
require
class
that
didn
t
interest
me
and
begin
drop
in
on
the
one
that
look
far
more
interest
the
second
be
about
how
get
fire
from
apple
turn
out
to
be
good
for
him
the
heaviness
of
be
successful
be
replace
by
the
lightness
of
be
a
beginner
again
less
sure
about
everything
the
student
be
unusually
attentive
despite
a
plane
circle
overhead
with
a
banner
that
exhort
recycle
all
e
waste
and
it
be
his
third
tale
that
enthral
them
it
be
about
be
diagnose
with
cancer
and
the
awareness
it
brought
remember
that
i
ll
be
dead
soon
be
the
most
important
tool
i
ve
ever
encounter
to
help
me
make
the
big
choice
in
life
because
almost
everything
all
external
expectation
all
pride
all
fear
of
embarrassment
or
failure
these
thing
just
fall
away
in
the
face
of
death
leave
only
what
be
truly
important
remember
that
you
be
go
to
die
be
the
best
way
i
know
to
avoid
the
trap
of
think
you
have
something
to
lose
you
be
already
naked
there
be
no
reason
not
to
follow
your
heart
the
artful
minimalism
of
the
speech
give
it
simplicity
purity
and
charm
search
where
you
will
from
anthology
to
youtube
and
you
won
t
find
a
well
commencement
address
others
may
have
be
more
important
such
as
george
marshall
s
at
harvard
in
announce
a
plan
to
rebuild
europe

none

and
he
avoid
step
into
the

like
strong

up
to
a
point
but
he
have
never
truly
empower
a
deputy
or
share
the
stage
it
be
hard
to
be
his
understudy
you
be
damn
if

and
damn
if
you
didn

he
didn
t
seek
any

acclaim
for
himself
some
people
resent
the
fact
that
steve
get
credit
for
everything
but
i
ve
never
give
a
rat
s
as
about
that

i
d

kept
the
move

at
apple
tightly
mesh
and
remain
unfazed
by
job
s
tantrum
what
i
learn
about
steve
be
that
people
mistook
some
of
his
comment
as
rant
or
negativism
but
it
be
really
just
the
way
he
show
passion
so
that
s
how
i
process
it
and
i
never
take
issue
personally
in
many
way
he
be
job
s
mirror
image
unflappable
steady
in
his
mood
and
as
the
thesaurus
in
the
next
would
have
note
saturnine
rather
than
mercurial
i
m
a
good
negotiator
but
he
s
probably
well
than
me
because
he
s
a
cool
customer
job
later
say
after
add
a
bit
more
praise
he
quietly
add
a
reservation
one
that
be
serious
but
rarely
spoken
but
tim
s
not
a
product
person
per
se
in
the
fall
of
after
return
from
his
medical
leave
job
tapped
cook
to
become
apple
s
chief
operating
officer
they
be
fly
together
to
japan
job
didn
t
really
ask
cook
he
simply
turn
to
him
and
say
i
ve
decide
to
make
you
coo
around
that
time
job
s
old
friend
jon
rubinstein
and
avie
tevanian
the
hardware
and
software
lieutenant
who
have
be
recruit
during
the
restoration
decide
to
leave
in
tevanian
s
case
he
have
make
a
lot
of
money
and
be
ready
to
quit
work
avie
be
a
brilliant
guy
and
a
nice
guy
much
more
ground
than
ruby
and
doesn
t
carry
the
big
ego
say
job
it
be
a
huge
loss
for
us
when
avie
left
he
s
a
one
of
a
kind
person
a
genius
rubinstein
s
case
be
a
little
more
contentious
he
be
upset
by
cook
s
ascendency
and
frazzle
after
work
for
nine
year
under
job
their
shout
match
become
more
frequent
there
be
also
a
substantive
issue
rubinstein
be
repeatedly
clash
with
jony
ive
who
use
to
work
for
him
and
now
report
directly
to
job
ive
be
always
push
the
envelope
with
design
that
dazzle
but
be
difficult
to
engineer
it
be
rubinstein
s
job
to
get
the
hardware
built
in
a
practical
way
so
he
often
balk
he
be
by
nature
cautious
in
the
end
ruby
s
from
hp
say
job
and
he
never
delve
deep
he
wasn
t
aggressive
there
be
for
example
the
case
of
the
screw
that
held
the
handle
on
the
power
mac
g
ive
decide
that
they
should
have
a
certain
polish
and
shape
but
rubinstein
thought
that
would
be
astronomically
costly
and
delay
the
project
for
week
so
he
vetoed
the
idea
his
job
be
to
deliver
product
which
meant
make
trade
offs
ive
view
that
approach
as
inimical
to
innovation
so
he
would
go
both
above
him
to
job
and
also
around
him
to
the
midlevel
engineer
ruby
would
say
you
can
t
do
this
it
will
delay
and
i
would
say
i
think
we
can
ive
recall
and
i
would
know
because
i
have
work
behind
his
back
with
the
product
team
in
this
and
other
case
job
come
down
on
ive
s
side
at
time
ive
and
rubinstein
get
into
argument
that
almost
lead
to
blow
finally
ive
told
job
it
s
him
or
me
job
chose
ive
by
that
point
rubinstein
be
ready
to
leave
he
and
his
wife
have
bought
property
in
mexico
and
he
want
time
off
to
build
a
home
there
he
eventually
go
to
work
for
palm
which
be
try
to
match
apple
s
iphone
job
be
so
furious
that
palm
be
hire
some
of
his
former
employee
that
he
complain
to
bono
who
be
a
cofounder
of
a
private
equity
group
lead
by
the
former
apple
cfo
fred
anderson
that
have
bought
a
control
stake
in
palm
bono
sent
job
a
note
back
say
you
should
chill
out
about
this
this
be
like
the
beatles
ring
up
because
herman
and
the
hermit
have
take
one
of
their
road
crew
job
later
admit
that
he
have
overreact
the
fact
that
they
completely
fail
salve
that
wound
he
say
job
be
able
to
build
a
new
management
team
that
be
less
contentious
and
a
bit
more
subdue
its
main
player
in
addition
to
cook
and
ive
be
scott
forstall
run
iphone
software
phil
schiller
in
charge
of
marketing
bob
mansfield
do
mac
hardware
eddy
cue
handle
internet
service
and
peter
oppenheimer
as
the
chief
financial
officer
even
though
there
be
a
surface
sameness
to
his
top
team
all
be
middle
age
white
male
there
be
a
range
of
style
ive
be
emotional
and
expressive
cook
be
as
cool
as
steel
they
all
knew
they
be
expect
to
be
deferential
to
job
while
also
push
back
on
his
idea
and
be
willing
to
argue
a
tricky
balance
to
maintain
but
each
do
it
well
i
realize
very
early
that
if
you
didn
t
voice
your
opinion
he
would
mow
you
down
say
cook
he
take
contrary
position
to
create
more
discussion
because
it
may
lead
to
a
well
result
so
if
you
don
t
feel
comfortable
disagree
then
you
ll
never
survive
the
key
venue
for
freewheel
discourse
be
the
monday
morning
executive
team
gathering
which
start
at
and
go
for
three
or
four
hour
the
focus
be
always
on
the
future
what
should
each
product
do
next
what
new
thing
should
be
developed
job
use
the
meeting
to
enforce
a
sense
of
share
mission
at
apple
this
serve
to
centralize
control
which
make
the
company
seem
as
tightly
integrate
as
a
good
apple
product
and
prevent
the
struggle
between
division
that
plague
decentralize
company
job
also
use
the
meeting
to
enforce
focus
at
robert
friedland
s
farm
his
job
have
be
to
prune
the
apple
tree
so
that
they
would
stay
strong
and
that
become
a
metaphor
for
his
prune
at
apple
instead
of
encourage
each
group
to
let
product
line
proliferate
base
on
marketing
consideration
or
permit
a
thousand
idea
to
bloom
job
insist
that
apple
focus
on
just
two
or
three
priority
at
a
time
there
be
no
one
well
at
turn
off
the
noise
that
be
go
on
around
him
cook
say
that
allows
him
to
focus
on
a
few
thing
and
say
no
to
many
thing
few
people
be
really
good
at
that
in
order
to
institutionalize
the
lesson
that
he
and
his
team
be
learn
job
start
an
in
house
center
call
apple
university
he
hire
joel
podolny
who
be
dean
of
the
yale
school
of
management
to
compile
a
series
of
case
study
analyze
important
decision
the
company
have
make
include
the
switch

the

to
open
the
apple
store
top
executive
spent
time
teach
the
case
to
new
employee
so
that
the
apple
style
of
decision
make
would
be
embed
in
the
culture
in
ancient
rome
when
a
victorious
general
parade
through
the
street
legend
have
it
that
he
be
sometimes
trail
by
a
servant
whose
job
it
be
to
repeat
to
him
memento
mori
remember
you
will
die
a
reminder
of
mortality
would
help
the
hero
keep
thing
in
perspective
instill
some
humility
job
s
memento
mori
have
be
deliver
by
his
doctor
but
it
do
not
instill
humility
instead
he
roar
back
after
his
recovery
with
even
more
passion
the
illness
remind
him
that
he
have
nothing
to
lose
so
he
should
forge
ahead
full
speed
he
come
back
on
a
mission
say
cook
even
though
he
be
now
run
a
large
company
he
kept
make
bold
move
that
i
don
t
think
anybody
else
would
have
do
for
a
while
there
be
some
evidence
or
at
least
hope
that
he
have
temper
his
personal
style
that
face
cancer
and
turn
fifty
have
cause
him
to
be
a
bit
less
brutish
when
he
be
upset
right
after
he
come
back
from
his
operation
he
didn
t
do
the
humiliation
bit
as
much
tevanian
recall
if
he
be
displeased
he
might
scream
and
get
hop
mad
and
use
expletive
but
he
wouldn
t
do
it
in
a
way
that
would
totally
destroy
the
person
he
be
talk
to
it
be
just
his
way
to
get
the
person
to
do
a
well
job
tevanian
reflect
for
a
moment
as
he
say
this
then
add
a
caveat
unless
he
thought
someone
be
really
bad
and
have
to
go
which
happen
every
once
in
a
while
eventually
however
the
rough
edge
return
because
most
of
his
colleague
be
use
to
it
by
then
and
have
learn
to
cope
what
upset
them
most
be
when
his
ire
turn
on
stranger
once
we
go
to
a
whole
food
market
to
get
a
smoothie
ive
recall
and
this
old
woman
be
make
it
and
he
really
get
on
her
about
how
she
be
do
it
then
later
he
sympathize
she
s
an
old
woman
and
doesn
t
want
to
be
do
this
job
he
didn
t
connect
the
two
he
be
be
a
purist
in
both
case
on
a
trip
to
london
with
job
ive
have
the
thankless
task
of
choose
the
hotel
he
picked
the
hempel
a
tranquil
five
star
boutique
hotel
with
a
sophisticated
minimalism
that
he
thought
job
would
love
but
as
soon
as
they
checked
in
he
brace
himself
and
sure
enough
his
phone
rang
a
minute
later
i
hate
my
room
job
declare
it
s
a
piece
of
shit
let
s
go
so
ive
gather
his
luggage
and
go
to
the
front
desk
where
job
bluntly
told
the
shock
clerk
what
he
thought
ive
realize
that
most
people
himself
among
them
tend
not
to
be
direct
when
they
feel
something
be
shoddy
because
they
want
to
be
like
which
be
actually
a
vain
trait
that
be
an
overly
kind
explanation
in
any
case
it
be
not
a
trait
job
have
because
ive
be
so
instinctively
nice
he
puzzle
over
why
job
whom
he
deeply
like
behave
as
he
do
one
even
in
a
san
francisco
bar
he
lean
forward
with
an
earnest
intensity
and
try
to
analyze
it
he
s
a
very
very
sensitive
guy
that
s
one
of
the
thing
that
make
his
antisocial
behavior
his
rudeness
so
unconscionable
i
can
understand
why
people
who
be
thick
skin
and
unfeeling
can
be
rude
but
not
sensitive
people
i
once
ask
him
why
he
get
so
mad
about
stuff
he
say
but
i
don
t
stay
mad
he
have
this
very
childish
ability
to
get
really
work
up
about
something
and
it
doesn
t
stay
with
him
at
all
but
there
be
other
time
i
think
honestly
when
he
s
very
frustrate
and
his
way
to
achieve
catharsis
be
to
hurt
somebody
and
i
think
he
feel
he
have
a
liberty
and
a
license
to
do
that
the
normal
rule
of
social
engagement
he
feel
don
t
apply
to
him
because
of
how
very
sensitive
he
be
he
know
exactly
how
to
efficiently
and
effectively
hurt
someone
and
he
do
do
that
every
now
and
then
a
wise
colleague
would
pull
job
aside
to
try
to
get
him
to
settle
down
lee
clow
be
a
master
steve
can
i
talk
to
you
he
would
quietly
say
when
job
have
belittle
someone
publicly
he
would
go
into
job
s
office
and
explain
how
hard
everyone
be
work
when
you
humiliate
them
it
s
more
debilitate
than
stimulate
he
say
in
one
such
session
job
would
apologize
and
say
he
understood
but
then
he
would
lapse
again
it
s
simply
who
i
be
he
would
say
one
thing
that
do
mellow
be
his
attitude
toward
bill
gate
microsoft
have
kept
its
end
of
the
bargain
it
make
in
when
it
agree
to
continue
develop
great
software
for
the
macintosh
also
it
be
become
less
relevant
as
a
competitor
have
fail
thus
far
to
replicate
apple
s
digital
hub
strategy
gate
and
job
have
very
different
approach
to
product
and
innovation
but
their
rivalry
have
produce
in
each
a
surprising
self
awareness
for
their
all
thing
digital
conference
in
may
the
wall
street
journal
columnist
walt
mossberg
and
kara
swisher
work
to
get
them
together
for
a
joint
interview
mossberg
first
invite
job
who
didn
t
go
to
many
such
conference
and
be
surprised
when
he
say
he
would
do
it
if
gate
would
on
hearing
that
gate
accepted
as
well
mossberg
want
the
even
joint
appearance
to
be
a
cordial
discussion
not
a
debate
but
that
seem
less
likely
when
job
unleashed
a
swipe
at
microsoft
during
a
solo
interview

about
the
fact
that
apple

itunes
software
for
window
computer
be
extremely
popular
job
joked
it
s
like
give
a
glass
of
ice
water
to
somebody
in
hell
so
when
it
be
time
for
gate
and
job
to
meet
in
the
green
room
before
their
joint
session
that
even
mossberg
be
worried
gate
get
there
first
with
his
aide
larry
cohen
who
have
briefed
him
about
job
s
remark
earlier
that
day
when
job
amble
in
a
few
minute
later
he
grabbed
a
bottle
of
water
from
the
ice
bucket
and
sat
down
after
a
moment
or
two
of
silence
gate
say
so
i
guess
i
m
the
representative
from
hell
he
wasn
t
smile
job
pause
give
him
one
of
his
impish
grin
and
hand
him
the
ice
water
gate
relaxed
and
the
tension
dissipate
the
result
be
a
fascinate
duet
in
which
each
wunderkind
of
the
digital
age
spoke
warily
and
then
warmly
about
the
other
most
memorably
they
give
candid
answer
when
the
technology
strategist
lise
buyer
who
be
in
the
audience
ask
what
each
have
learn
from
observe
the
other
well
i
d
give
a
lot
to
have
steve
s
taste
gate
answer
there
be
a
bit
of
nervous
laughter
job
have
famously
say
ten
year
earlier
that
his
problem
with
microsoft
be
that
it
have
absolutely
no
taste
but
gate
insist
he
be
serious
job
be
a
natural
in
term
of
intuitive
taste
he
recall
how
he
and
job
use
to
sit
together
review
the
software
that
microsoft
be
make
for
the
macintosh
i
d
see
steve
make
the
decision
base
on
a
sense
of
people
and
product
that
you
know
be
hard
for
me
to
explain
the
way
he
do
thing
be
just
different
and
i
think
it
s
magical
and
in
that
case
wow
job
star
at
the
floor
later
he
told
me
that
he
be
blown
away
by
how
honest
and
gracious
gate
have
just
be
job
be
equally
honest
though
not
quite
as
gracious
when
his
turn
come
he
described
the
great
divide
between
the
apple
theology
of
building
end
to
end
integrate
product
and
microsoft
s
openness
to
licensing
its
software
to
compete
hardware
maker
in
the
music
market
the
integrate
approach
as
manifest
in
his
itunes
ipod
package
be
prove
to
be
the
well
he
note
but
microsoft
s
decouple
approach
be
fare
well
in
the
personal
computer
market
one
question
he
raise
in
an
offhand
way
be
which
approach
might
work
well
for
mobile
phone
then
he
go
on
to
make
an
insightful
point
this
difference
in
design
philosophy
he
say
lead
him
and
apple
to
be
less
good
at
collaborate
with
other
company
because
woz
and
i
start
the
company
base
on
do
the
whole
banana
we
weren
t
so
good
at
partner
with
people
he
say
and
i
think
if
apple
could
have
have
a
little
more
of
that
in
its
dna
it
would
have
serve
it
extremely
well
chapter
thirty
six
the
iphone
three
revolutionary
product
in
one
an
ipod
that
make
call
by
ipod
sale
be
skyrocket
an
astonish
twenty
million
be
sell
that
year
quadruple
the
number
of
the
year
before
the
product
be
become
more
important
to
the
company
s
bottom
line
accounting
for
of
the
revenue
that
year
and
it
be
also
burnish
the
hipness
of
the
company
s
image
in
a
way
that
drove
sale
of
mac
that
be
why
job
be
worried
he
be
always
obsess
about
what
could
mess
us
up
board
member
art
levinson
recall
the
conclusion
he
have
come
to
the
device
that
can
eat
our
lunch
be
the
cell
phone
as
he
explain
to
the
board
the
digital
camera
market
be
be
decimate
now
that
phone
be
equip
with
camera
the
same
could
happen
to
the
ipod
if
phone
manufacturer
start
to
build
music
player
into
them
everyone
carry
a
phone
so
that
could
render
the
ipod
unnecessary
his
first
strategy
be
to
do
something
that
he
have
admit
in
front
of
bill
gate
be
not
in
his
dna
to
partner
with
another
company
he
begin
talk
to
ed
zander
the
new
ceo
of
motorola
about
make
a
companion
to
motorola
s
popular
razr
which
be
a
cell
phone
and
digital
camera
that
would
have
an
ipod
built
in
thus
be
born
the
rokr
it
end
up
have
neither
the
entice
minimalism
of
an
ipod
nor
the
convenient
slimness
of
a
razr
ugly
difficult
to
load
and
with
an
arbitrary
hundred
song
limit
it
have
all
the
hallmark
of
a
product
that
have
be
negotiate
by
a
committee
which
be
counter
to
the
way
job
like
to
work
instead
of
hardware
software
and
content
all
be
control
by
one
company
they
be
cobble
together
by
motorola
apple
and
the
wireless
carrier
cingular
you
call
this
the
phone
of
the
future
wire
scoffed
on
its
november
cover
job
be
furious
i
m
sick
of
deal
with
these
stupid
company
like
motorola
he
told
tony
fadell
and
others
at
one
of
the
ipod
product
review
meeting
let
s
do
it
ourselves
he
have
notice
something
odd
about
the
cell
phone
on
the
market
they
all
stank
just
like
portable
music
player
use
to
we
would
sit
around
talk
about
how
much
we
hat
our
phone
he
recall
they
be
way
too
complicate
they
have
feature
nobody
could
figure
out
include
the
address
book
it
be
just
byzantine
george
riley
an
outside
lawyer
for
apple
remembers
sit
at
meeting
to
go
over
legal
issue
and
job
would
get
bore
grab
riley
s
mobile
phone
and
start
point
out
all
the
way
it
be
brain
dead
so
job
and
his
team
become
excite
about
the
prospect
of
building
a
phone
that
they
would
want
to
use
that
s
the
best
motivator
of
all
job
later
say
another
motivator
be
the
potential
market
more
than
million
mobile
phone
be
sell
in
to
everyone
from
grammar
schoolers
to
grandmother
since
most
be
junky
there
be
room
for
a
premium
and
hip
product
just
as
there
have
be
in
the
portable
music
player
market
at
first
he
give
the
project
to
the
apple
group
that
be
make
the
airport
wireless
base
station
on
the
theory
that
it
be
a
wireless
product
but
he
soon
realize
that
it
be
basically
a
consumer
device
like
the
ipod
so
he
reassign
it
to
fadell
and
his
teammate
their
initial
approach
be
to
modify
the
ipod
they
try
to
use
the
trackwheel
as
a
way
for
a
user
to
scroll
through
phone
option
and
without
a
keyboard
try
to
enter
number
it
be
not
a
natural
fit
we
be
have
a
lot
of
problem
use
the
wheel
especially
in
get
it
to
dial
phone
number
fadell
recall
it
be
cumbersome
it
be
fine
for
scroll
through
an
address
book
but
horrible
at
inputting
anything
the
team
kept
try
to
convince
themselves
that
user
would
mainly
be
call
people
who
be
already
in
their
address
book
but
they
knew
that
it
wouldn
t
really
work
at
that
time
there
be
a
second
project
under
way
at
apple
a
secret
effort
to
build
a
tablet
computer
in
these
narrative
intersect
and
the
idea
for
the
tablet
flow
into
the
planning
for
the
phone
in
other
word
the
idea
for
the
ipad
actually
come
before
and
help
to
shape
the
birth
of
the
iphone
multi
touch
one
of
the
engineer
develop
a
tablet
pc
at
microsoft
be
married
to
a
friend
of
laurene
and
steve

and
for
his
fiftieth
birthday
he
want
to
have
a
dinner
party
that
include
them
along
with
bill
and
melinda
gate
job
go
a
bit
reluctantly
steve
be
actually
quite
friendly
to
me
at
the
dinner
gate
recall
but
he
wasn
t
particularly
friendly
to
the
birthday
guy
gate
be
annoyed
that
the
guy
kept
reveal
information
about
the
tablet
pc
he
have
developed
for
microsoft
he
s
our
employee
and
he
s
reveal
our
intellectual
property
gate
recount
job
be
also
annoyed
and
it
have
just
the
consequence
that
gate
fear
as
job
recall
this
guy
badger
me
about
how
microsoft
be
go
to
completely
change
the
world
with
this
tablet
pc
software
and
eliminate
all
notebook
computer
and
apple
ought
to
license
his
microsoft
software
but
he
be
do
the
device
all
wrong
it
have
a
stylus
as
soon
as
you
have
a
stylus
you
re
dead
this
dinner
be
like
the
tenth
time
he
talk
to
me
about
it
and
i
be
so
sick
of
it
that
i
come
home
and
say
fuck
this
let
s
show
him
what
a
tablet
can
really
be
job
go
into
the
office
the
next
day
gather
his
team
and
say
i
want
to
make
a
tablet
and
it
can
t
have
a
keyboard
or
a
stylus
user
would
be
able
to
type
by
touch
the
screen
with
their
finger
that
meant
the
screen
need
to
have
a
feature
that
become
know
as
multi
touch
the
ability
to
process
multiple
input
at
the
same
time
so
could
you
guy
come
up
with
a
multi
touch
touch
sensitive
display
for
me
he
ask
it
take
them
about
six
month
but
they
come
up
with
a
crude
but
workable
prototype
jony
ive
have
a
different
memory
of
how
multi
touch
be
developed
he
say
his
design
team
have
already
be
work
on
a
multi
touch
input
that
be
developed
for
the
trackpads
of
apple
s
macbook
pro
and
they
be
experiment
with
way
to
transfer
that
capability
to
a
computer
screen
they
use
a
projector
to
show
on
a
wall
what
it
would
look
like
this
be
go
to
change
everything
ive
told
his
team
but
he
be
careful
not
to
show
it
to
job
right
away
especially
since
his
people
be
work
on
it
in
their
spare
time
and
he
didn
t
want
to
quash
their
enthusiasm
because
steve
be
so
quick
to
give
an
opinion
i
don
t
show
him
stuff
in
front
of
other
people
ive
recall
he
might
say
this
be
shit
and
snuff
the
idea
i
feel
that
idea
be
very
fragile
so
you
have
to
be
tender
when
they
be
in
development
i
realize
that
if
he
piss
on
this
it
would
be
so
sad
because
i
knew
it
be
so
important
ive
set
up
the
demonstration
in
his
conference
room
and
show
it
to
job
privately
know
that
he
be
less
likely
to
make
a
snap
judgment
if
there
be
no
audience
fortunately
he
love
it
this
be
the
future
he
exult
it
be
in
fact
such
a
good
idea
that
job
realize
that
it
could
solve
the
problem
they
be
have
create
an
interface
for
the
propose
cell
phone
that
project
be
far
more
important
so
he
put
the
tablet
development
on
hold
while
the
multi
touch
interface
be
adopt
for
a
phone
size
screen
if
it
work
on
a
phone
he
recall
i
knew
we
could
go
back
and
use
it
on
a
tablet
job
call
fadell
rubinstein
and
schiller
to
a
secret
meeting
in
the
design
studio
conference
room
where
ive
give
a
demonstration
of
multi
touch
wow
say
fadell
everyone
like
it
but
they
be
not
sure
that
they
would
be
able
to
make
it
work
on
a
mobile
phone
they
decide
to
proceed
on
two

p

code

for
the

his
conference
room
to
make
a
decision
fadell
have
be
try
hard
to
develop
the
trackwheel
model
but
he
admit
they
have
not
crack
the
problem
of
figure
out
a
simple
way
to
dial
call
the
multi
touch
approach
be
riskier
because
they
be
unsure
whether
they
could
execute
the
engineering
but
it
be
also
more
excite
and
promising
we
all
know
this
be
the
one
we
want
to
do
say
job
point
to
the
touchscreen
so
let
s
make
it
work
it
be
what
he
like
to
call
a
bet
the
company
moment
high
risk
and
high
reward
if
it
succeed
a
couple
of
member
of
the
team
argue
for
have
a
keyboard
as
well
give
the
popularity
of
the
blackberry
but
job
vetoed
the
idea
a
physical
keyboard
would
take
away
space
from
the
screen
and
it
would
not
be
as
flexible
and
adaptable
as
a
touchscreen
keyboard
a
hardware
keyboard
seem
like
an
easy
solution
but
it
s
constrain
he
say
think
of
all
the
innovation
we
d
be
able
to
adapt
if
we
do
the
keyboard
onscreen
with
software
let
s
bet
on
it
and
then
we
ll
find
a
way
to
make
it
work
the
result
be
a
device
that
display
a
numerical
pad
when
you
want
to
dial
a
phone
number
a
typewriter
keyboard
when
you
want
to
write
and
whatever
button
you
might
need
for
each
particular
activity
and
then
they
all
disappear
when
you
re
watch
a
video
by
have
software
replace
hardware
the
interface
become
fluid
and
flexible
job
spent
part
of
every
day
for
six
month
help
to
refine
the
display
it
be
the
most
complex
fun
i
ve
ever
have
he
recall
it
be
like
be
the
one
evolve
the
variation
on
sgt
pepper
a
lot
of
feature
that
seem
simple
now
be
the
result
of
creative
brainstorm
for
example
the
team
worried
about
how
to
prevent
the
device
from
play
music
or
make
a
call
accidentally
when
it
be
jangling
in
your
pocket
job
be
congenitally
averse
to
have
on
off
switch
which
he
deem
inelegant
the
solution
be
swipe
to
open
the
simple
and
fun
on
screen
slider
that
activate
the
device
when
it
have
go
dormant
another
breakthrough
be
the
sensor
that
figure
out
when
you
put
the
phone
to
your
ear
so
that
your
lobe
didn
t
accidentally
activate
some
function
and
of
course
the
icon
come
in
his
favorite
shape
the
primitive
he
make
bill
atkinson
design
into
the
software
of
the
first
macintosh
round
rectangle
in
session
after
session
with
job
immerse
in
every
detail
the
team
member
figure
out
way
to
simplify
what
other
phone
make
complicate
they
add
a
big
bar
to
guide
you
in
put
call
on
hold
or
make
conference
call
found
easy
way
to
navigate
through
email
and
create
icon
you
could
scroll
through
horizontally
to
get
to
different
apps
all
of
which
be
easy
because
they
could
be
use
visually
on
the
screen
rather
than
by
use
a
keyboard
built
into
the
hardware
gorilla
glass
job
become
infatuate
with
different
material
the
way
he
do
with
certain
food
when
he
go
back
to
apple
in
and
start
work
on
the
imac
he
have
embrace
what
could
be
do
with
translucent
and
color
plastic
the
next
phase
be
metal
he
and
ive
replace
the
curvy
plastic
powerbook
g
with
the
sleek
titanium
powerbook
g
which
they
redesign
two
year
later
in
aluminum
as
if
just
to
demonstrate
how
much
they
like
different
metal
then
they
do
an
imac
and
an
ipod
nano
in
anodize
aluminum
which
meant
that
the
metal
have
be
put
in
an
acid
bath
and
electrify
so
that
its
surface
oxidize
job
be
told
it
could
not
be
do
in
the
quantity
they
need
so
he
have
a
factory
built
in
china
to
handle
it
ive
go
there
during
the
sars
epidemic
to
oversee
the
process
i
stayed
for
three
month
in
a
dormitory
to
work
on
the
process
he
recall
ruby
and
others
say
it
would
be
impossible
but
i
want
to
do
it
because
steve
and
i
felt
that
the
anodize
aluminum
have
a
real
integrity
to
it
next
be
glass
after
we
do
metal
i
look
at
jony
and
say
that
we
have
to
master
glass
say
job
for
the
apple
store
they
have
create
huge
windowpane
and
glass
stair
for
the
iphone
the
original
plan
be
for
it
to
have
a
plastic
screen
like
the
ipod
but
job
decide
it
would
feel
much
more
elegant
and
substantive
if
the
screen
be
glass
so
he
set
about
find
a
glass
that
would
be
strong
and
resistant
to
scratch
the
natural
place
to
look
be
asia
where
the
glass
for
the
store
be
be
make
but
job
s
friend
john
seeley
brown
who
be
on
the
board
of
corn
glass
in
upstate
new
york
told
him
that
he
should
talk
to
that
company
s
young
and
dynamic
ceo
wendell
week
so
he
dial
the
main
corn
switchboard
number
and
ask
to
be
put
through
to
week
he
get
an
assistant
who
offer
to
pas
along
the
message
no
i
m
steve
job
he
reply
put
me
through
the
assistant
refuse
job
call
brown
and
complain
that
he
have
be
subject
to
typical
east
coast
bullshit
when
week
heard
that
he
call
the
main
apple
switchboard
and
ask
to
speak
to
job
he
be
told
to
put
his
request
in
write
and
send
it
in
by
fax
when
job
be
told
what
happen
he
take
a
like
to
week
and
invite
him
to
cupertino
job
described
the
type
of
glass
apple
want
for
the
iphone
and
week
told
him
that
corn
have
developed
a
chemical
exchange
process
in
the
s
that
lead
to
what
they
dubbed
gorilla
glass
it
be
incredibly
strong
but
it
have
never
found
a
market
so
corn
quit
make
it
job
say
he
doubt
it
be
good
enough
and
he
start
explain
to
week
how
glass
be
make
this
amuse
week
who
of
course
knew
more
than
job
about
that
topic
can
you
shut
up
week
interject
and
let
me
teach
you
some
science
job
be
take
aback
and
fell
silent
week
go
to
the
whiteboard
and
give
a
tutorial
on
the
chemistry
which
involve
an
ion
exchange
process
that
produce
a
compression
layer
on
the
surface
of
the
glass
this
turn
job
around
and
he
say
he
want
as
much
gorilla
glass
as
corn
could
make
within
six
month
we
don
t
have
the
capacity
week
reply
none
of
our
plant
make
the
glass
now
don
t
be
afraid
job
reply
this
stun
week
who
be
good
humor
and
confident
but
not
use
to
job
s
reality
distortion
field
he
try
to
explain
that
a
false
sense
of
confidence
would
not
overcome
engineering
challenge
but
that
be
a
premise
that
job
have
repeatedly
show
he
didn
t
accept
he
star
at
week
unblinking
yes
you
can
do
it
he
say
get
your
mind
around
it
you
can
do
it
as
week
retold
this
story
he
shook
his
head
in
astonishment
we
do
it
in
under
six
month
he
say
we
produce
a
glass
that
have
never
be
make
corn
s
facility
in
harrisburg
kentucky
which
have
be
make
lcd
display
be
convert
almost
overnight
to
make
gorilla
glass
full
time
we
put
our
best
scientist
and
engineer
on
it
and
we
just
make
it
work
in
his
airy
office
week
have
just
one
frame
memento
on
display
it
s
a
message
job
sent
the
day
the
iphone
come
out
we
couldn
t
have
do
it
without
you
the
design
on
many
of
his
major
project
such
as
the
first
toy
story
and
the
apple
store
job
press
pause
as
they
near
completion
and
decide
to
make
major
revision
that
happen
with
the
design
of
the
iphone
as
well
the
initial
design
have
the
glass
screen
set
into
an
aluminum
case
one
monday
morning
job
go
over
to
see
ive
i
didn
t
sleep
last
night
he
say
because
i
realize
that
i
just
don
t
love
it
it
be
the
most
important
product
he
have
make
since
the
first
macintosh
and
it
just
didn
t
look
right
to
him
ive
to
his
dismay
instantly
realize
that
job
be
right
i
remember
feel
absolutely
embarrass
that
he
have
to
make
the
observation
the
problem
be
that
the
iphone
should
have
be
all
about
the
display
but
in
their
current
design
the
case
compete
with
the
display
instead
of
get
out
of
the
way
the
whole
device
felt
too
masculine
task
driven
efficient
guy
you
ve
kill
yourselves
over
this
design
for
the
last
nine
month
but
we
re
go
to
change
it
job
told
ive
s
team
we
re
all
go
to
have
to
work
night
and
weekend
and
if
you
want
we
can
hand
out
some
gun
so
you
can
kill
us
now
instead
of
balking
the
team
agree
it
be
one
of
my
proudest
moment
at
apple
job
recall
the
new
design
end
up
with
just
a
thin
stainless
steel
bezel
that
allow
the
gorilla
glass
display
to
go
right
to
the
edge
every
part
of
the
device
seem
to
defer
to
the
screen
the
new
look
be
austere
yet
also
friendly
you
could
fondle
it
it
meant
they
have
to
redo
the
circuit
board
antenna
and
processor
placement
inside
but
job
order
the
change
other
company
may
have
ship
say
fadell
but
we
press
the
reset
button
and
start
over
one
aspect
of
the
design
which
reflect
not
only
job
s
perfectionism
but
also
his
desire
to
control
be
that
the
device
be
tightly
seal
the
case
could
not
be
open
even
to
change
the
battery
as
with
the
original
macintosh
in
job
do
not
want
people
fiddle
inside
in
fact
when
apple
discover
in
that
third
party
repair
shop
be
opening
up
the
iphone
it
replace
the
tiny
screw
with
a
tamper
resistant
pentalobe
screw
that
be
impossible
to
open
with
a
commercially
available
screwdriver
by
not
have
a
replaceable
battery
it
be
possible
to
make
the
iphone
much
thinner
for
job
thinner
be
always
well
he
s
always
believe
that
thin
be
beautiful
say
tim
cook
you
can
see
that
in
all
of
the
work
we
have
the
thinnest
notebook
the
thinnest
smartphone
and
we
make
the
ipad
thin
and
then
even
thinner
the
launch
when
it
come
time
to
launch
the
iphone
job
decide
as
usual
to
grant
a
magazine
a
special
sneak
preview
he
call
john
huey
the
editor
in
chief
of
time
inc
and
begin
with
his
typical
superlative
this
be
the
best
thing
we
ve
ever
do
he
want
to
give
time
the
exclusive
but
there
s
nobody
smart
enough
at
time
to
write
it
so
i
m
go
to
give
it
to
someone
else
huey
introduce
him
to
lev
grossman
a
savvy
technology
writer
and
novelist
at
time
in
his
piece
grossman
correctly
note
that
the
iphone
do
not
really
invent
many
new
feature
it
just
make
these
feature
a
lot
more
usable
but
that
s
important
when
our
tool
don
t
work
we
tend
to
blame
ourselves
for
be
too
stupid
or
not
reading
the
manual
or
have
too
fat
finger
when
our
tool
be
broken
we
feel
broken
and
when
somebody
fix
one
we
feel
a
tiny
bit
more
whole
for
the
unveil
at
the
january
macworld
in
san
francisco
job
invite
back
andy
hertzfeld
bill
atkinson
steve
wozniak
and
the
macintosh
team
as
he
have
do
when
he
launch
the
imac
in
a
career
of
dazzle
product
presentation
this
may
have
be
his
best
every
once
in
a
while
a
revolutionary
product
come
along
that
change
everything
he
begin
he
refer
to
two
earlier
example
the
original
macintosh
which
change
the
whole
computer
industry
and
the
first
ipod
which
change
the
entire
music
industry
then
he
carefully
built
up
to
the
product
he
be
about
to
launch
today
we
re
introduce
three
revolutionary
product
of
this
class
the
first
one
be
a
widescreen
ipod
with
touch
control
the
second
be
a
revolutionary
mobile
phone
and
the
third
be
a
breakthrough
internet
communication
device
he

the

recurs
the
battle
of
by
the
begin
of
it
be
clear
to
job
and
his
doctor
that
his
cancer
be
spread
when
they
have
take
out
his
pancreatic
tumor
in
he
have
the

genome
partially
sequence
that
help
his
doctor
determine
which
pathway
be
broken
and
they
be
treat
him
with
target
therapy
that
they
thought
be
most
likely
to
work
he
be
also
be
treat
for
pain
usually
with
morphine
base
analgesic
one
day
in
february
when
powell
s
close
friend
kathryn
smith
be
stay
with
them
in
palo
alto
she
and
job
take
a
walk
he
told
me
that
when
he
feel
really
bad
he
just
concentrate
on
the
pain
go
into
the
pain
and
that
seem
to
dissipate
it
she
recall
that
wasn
t
exactly
true
however
when
job
be
in
pain
he
let
everyone
around
him
know
it
there
be
another
health
issue
that
become
increasingly
problematic
one
that
medical
researcher
didn

focus
on
as
rigorously
as
they
do
cancer
or
pain
he
be
have
eat
problem

partly
this

because

lose
much
of
his
pancreas
which
produce
the
enzyme
need
to
digest
protein
and
other
nutrient
it
be
also
because
both
the
cancer
and
the
morphine
reduce
his
appetite
and
then
there
be
the
psychological
component
which
the
doctor
barely
knew
how
to
address
since
his
early
teen
he
have
indulge
his

then
suddenly

that
food
and
declare
that
he
have
stop
eat
it
he
would
go
on
fast
just
as
he
do
as
a
teenager
and
he
become
sanctimonious
as
he
lecture
others
at

another
open
letter
to
the
apple
staff
at
first
he
blame
the
decision
on
the
pry
of
blogger
and
the
press
unfortunately
the
curiosity
over
my
personal
health
continue
to
be
a
distraction
not
only
for
me
and
my
family
but
everyone
else
at
apple
he
say
but
then
he
admit
that
the
remedy
for
his
hormone
imbalance
be
not
as
simple
as
he
have
claimed
during
the
past
week
i
have
learn
that
my
health
related
issue
be
more
complex
than
i
originally
thought
tim
cook
would
again
take
over
daily
operation
but
job
say
that
he
would
remain
ceo
continue
to
be
involve
in
major
decision
and
be
back
by
june
job
have
be
consult
with
bill
campbell
and
art
levinson
who
be
juggling
the
dual
role
of
be
his
personal
health
advisor
and
also
the
co
lead
director
of
the
company
but
the
rest
of
the
board
have
not
be
as
fully
inform
and
the
shareholder
have
initially
be
misinform
that
raise
some
legal
issue
and
the
sec
open
an
investigation
into
whether
the
company
have
withheld
material
information
from
shareholder
it
would
constitute
security
fraud
a
felony
if
the
company
have
allow
the
dissemination
of
false
information
or
withheld
true
information
that
be
relevant
to
the
company
s
financial
prospect
because
job
and
his
magic
be
so
closely
identify
with
apple
s
comeback
his
health
seem
to
meet
this
standard
but
it
be
a
murky
area
of
the
law
the
privacy
right
of
the
ceo
have
to
be
weigh
this
balance
be
particularly
difficult
in
the
case
of
job
who
both
value
his
privacy
and
embody
his
company
more
than
most
ceo
he
do
not
make
the
task
easy
he
become
very
emotional
both
rant
and
cry
at
time
when
rail
against
anyone
who
suggest
that
he
should
be
less
secretive
campbell
treasure
his
friendship
with
job
and
he
didn
t
want
to
have
any
fiduciary
duty
to
violate
his
privacy
so
he
offer
to
step
down
as
a
director
the
privacy
side
be
so
important
to
me
he
later
say
he
s
be
my
friend
for
about
a
million
year
the
lawyer
eventually
determine
that
campbell
didn
t
need
to
resign
from
the
board
but
that
he
should
step
aside
as
co
lead
director
he
be
replace
in
that
role
by
andrea
jung
of
avon
the
sec
investigation
end
up
go
nowhere
and
the
board
circle
the
wagon
to
protect
job
from
call
that
he
release
more
information
the
press
want
us
to
blurt
out
more
personal
detail
recall
al
gore
it
be
really
up
to
steve
to
go
beyond
what
the
law
require
but
he
be
adamant
that
he
didn
t
want
his
privacy
invade
his
wish
should
be
respect
when
i
ask
gore
whether
the

should
have
be
more
forthcoming
at
the
begin
of
when
job
s
health
issue
be
far
bad
than
shareholder
be
lead
to
believe
he
reply
we
hire
outside
counsel
to
do
a
review
of
what
the
law
require
and
what
the
best
practice
be
and
we
handle
it
all
by
the
book
i
sound
defensive
but
the
criticism
really
piss
me
off
one
board
member
disagreed
jerry
york
the
former
cfo
at
chrysler
and
ibm
do
not
say
anything
publicly
but
he
confide
to
a
reporter
at
the
wall
street
journal
off
the
record
that
he
be
disgust
when
he
learn
that
the
company
have
conceal
job
s
health
problem
in
late
frankly
i
wish
i
have
resign
then
when
york
die
in
the
journal
put
his
comment
on
the
record
york
have
also
provide
off
the
record
information
to
fortune
which
the
magazine
use
when
job
go
on
his
third
health
leave
in
some
at
apple
didn
t
believe
the
quote
attribute
to
york
be
accurate
since
he
have
not
officially
raise
objection
at
the
time
but
bill
campbell
knew
that
the
report
rang
true
york
have
complain
to
him
in
early
jerry
have
a
little
more
white
wine
than
he
should
have
late
at
night
and
he
would
call
at
two
or
three
in
the
morning
and
say
what
the
fuck
i
m
not
buying
that
shit
about
his
health
we
ve
get
to
make
sure
and
then
i
d
call
him
the
next
morning
and
he
d
say
oh
fine
no
problem
so
on
some
of
those
evening
i
m
sure
he
get
raggy
and
talk
to
reporter
memphis
the
head
of
job
s
oncology
team
be
stanford
university

a
lead
researcher
on

colorectal
cancer
he
have
be
warn
job
for
month
that
he
might
have
to
consider
a
liver
transplant
but
that
be
the
type
of
information
that
job
resist
processing
powell
be
glad
that
fisher
kept
raise
the
possibility
because
she
knew
it
would
take
repeat
prodding
to
get
her
husband
to
consider
the
idea
he
finally
become
convince
in
january
just
after
he
claimed
his
hormonal
imbalance
could
be
treat
easily
but
there
be
a
problem
he
be
put
on
the
wait
list
for
a
liver
transplant
in
california
but
it
become
clear
he
would
never
get
one
there
in
time
the
number
of
available
donor
with
his
blood
type
be
small
also
the
metric
use
by
the
united

for
organ
share
which
establishes
policy
in
the
united

favor
those

patient
there
be
no
legal
way
for
a
patient
even
one
as
wealthy
as
job
to
jump
the
queue
and
he
didn
t
recipient
be
chosen
base
on
their
meld
score
model
for
end
stage
liver
disease
which
us
lab
test
of

level
to
determine
how
urgently
a

and
on
the
length
of
time
they

every

how
many

what
their
meld

be
and
how
long
they
have
be
on
you
can
do
the
math
which
i
do
and
it
would
have
be
way
past
june
before
he
get
a
liver
in
california
and
the
doctor
felt
that
his
liver
would
give
out
in
about
april
she
recall
so
she
start
ask
question
and
discover
that
it
be
permissible
to
be
on
the
list
in
two
different
state
at
the
same
time
which
be
something
that
about
of
potential
recipient
do
such
multiple
listing
be
not
discourage
by
policy
even
though
critic
say
it
favor
the
rich
but
it
be
difficult
there
be
two
major
requirement
the
potential
recipient
have
to
be
able
to
get
to
the
chosen
hospital
within
eight
hour
which
job
could
do
thanks
to
his
plane
and
the
doctor
from
that
hospital
have
to
evaluate
the
patient
in
person
before
add
him
or
her
to
the

george

there
eason

one
of
the

busiest
in
the

in

he
have
no
problem
allow
people
from
elsewhere
to
multiple
list
in
memphis
it
s
not
game
the
system
he
say
it
s
people
choose
where
they
want
their
health
care
some
people
would
leave
tennessee
to
go
to
california
or
somewhere
else
to
seek
treatment
now
we
have
people
come
from

to
tennessee
riley
arrange
for
eason
to
fly
to
palo

have
secure
a
place
on
the
tennessee
list
as
well
as
the
one
in
california
and
the
nervous
wait
begin
he
be
decline
rapidly
by
the
first
week
in
march
and
the
wait
time
be
project
to
be
twenty
one
day
it
be
dreadful
powell
recall
it
didn
t
look
like
we
would
make
it
in
time
every
day
become
more
excruciate
he
move
up
to
third
on
the
list
by
mid
march
then
second
and
finally
first
but
then
day
go
by
the
awful
reality
be
that
upcoming
event
like
st
patrick
s
day
and
march
madness
memphis
be
in
the
tournament
and
be
a
regional
site
offer
a
great
likelihood
of
get
a
donor
because
the
drinking
cause
a
spike
in
car
accident
indeed
on
the
weekend
of
march
a
young
man
in
his
midtwenties
be
kill
in
a
car
crash
and
his
organ
be
make
available
job
and
his

flew
to
memphis
where
they
land
just
before
a
m
and
be
met
by
eason
a
car
be
wait
on
the

and
everything
be
stag
so
that
the
admit
paperwork
be
do
as
they
rush
to
the
hospital
the
transplant
be
a
success
but
not
reassure
when
the
doctor
take
out
his
liver
they
found
spot
on
the
peritoneum
the
thin
membrane
that
surround
internal
organ
in
addition
there
be
tumor
throughout
the
liver
which
meant
it
be
likely
that
the
cancer
have
migrate
elsewhere
as
well
it
have
apparently
mutate
and
grown
quickly
they
take
sample
and
do
more
genetic
mapping
a
few
day
later
they
need
to
perform
another
procedure
job
insist
against
all
advice
they
not

and
when
they
sedate
him
he
aspirate
some
of
the
content
into
his
lung
and
developed
pneumonia
at
that
point
they
thought
he
might
die
as
he
described
it
later
i
almost
die

in
this
routine
procedure
they
blew
it
laurene

there
and
they
flew
my

declaration
of
why
apple
would
continue
to
soar
even
with
job
absent
we
believe
that
we
be
on
the
face
of
the
earth
to
make
great
product
and
that
s
not
change
we
be
constantly
focus
on
innovate
we
believe
in
the
simple
not
the
complex
we
believe
that
we
need
to
own
and
control
the
primary
technology
behind
the
product
that
we
make
and
participate
only
in
market
where
we
can
make
a
significant
contribution
we
believe
in
say
no
to
thousand
of
project
so
that
we
can
really
focus
on
the
few
that
be
truly
important
and
meaningful
to
us
we
believe
in
deep
collaboration
and
cross
pollination
of
our
group
which
allow
us
to
innovate
in
a
way
that
others
cannot
and
frankly
we
don
t
settle
for
anything
less
than
excellence
in
every
group
in
the
company
and
we
have
the
self
honesty
to
admit
when
we
re
wrong
and
the
courage
to
change
and
i
think
regardless
of
who
be
in
what
job
those
value
be
so
embed
in
this
company
that

do
extremely
well

that
be
expensive
and
bulky
put
the
keyboard
on
the
screen
use
a
multi
touch
interface
he
suggest
job
agree
so
the
resource
be
direct
to
rev
up
the
tablet
project
rather
than
design
a
netbook
the
process
begin
with
job
and
ive
figure
out
the
right
screen
size
they
have
twenty
model
make
all
round
rectangle
of
course
in
slightly
vary
size
and
aspect
ratio
ive
laid
them
out
on
a
table
in
the
design
studio
and
in
the
afternoon
they
would
lift
the
velvet
cloth
hiding
them
and
play
with
them
that
s
how
we
nail
what
the
screen
size
be
ive
say
as
usual
job
push
for
the
purest
possible
simplicity
that
require
determine
what
be
the
core
essence
of
the
device
the
answer
the
display
screen
so
the
guide
principle
be
that
everything
they
do
have
to
defer
to
the
screen
how
do
we
get
out
of
the
way
so
there
aren
t
a
ton
of
feature
and
button
that
distract
from
the
display
ive
ask
at
every
step
job
push
to
remove
and
simplify
at
one
point
job
look
at
the
model
and
be
slightly
dissatisfied
it
didn
t
feel
casual
and
friendly
enough
so
that
you
would
naturally
scoop
it
up
and
whisk
it
away
ive
put
his
finger
so
to
speak
on
the
problem
they
need
to
signal
that
you
could
grab
it
with
one
hand
on
impulse
the
bottom
of
the
edge
need
to
be
slightly
round
so
that
you
d
feel
comfortable
just
scoop
it
up
rather
than
lift
it
carefully
that
meant
engineering
have
to
design
the
necessary
connection
port
and
button
in
a
simple
lip
that
be
thin
enough
to
wash
away
gently
underneath
if
you
have
be
pay
attention
to
patent
filing
you
would
have
notice
the
one
numbered
d
that
apple
apply
for
in
march
and
be
issue
fourteen
month
later
among
the
inventor
list
be
job
and
ive
the
application
carry
sketch
of
a
rectangular
electronic
tablet
with
round
edge
which
look
just
the
way
the
ipad
turn
out
include
one
of
a
man
hold
it
casually
in
his
left
hand
while
use
his
right
index
finger
to
touch
the
screen
since
the
macintosh
computer
be
now
use
intel
chip
job
initially
plan
to
use
in
the
ipad
the
low
voltage
atom
chip
that
intel
be
develop
paul
otellini
intel
s
ceo
be
push
hard
to
work
together
on
a
design
and
job
s
inclination
be
to
trust
him
his
company
be
make
the
fast
processor
in
the
world
but
intel
be
use
to
make
processor
for
machine
that
plug
into
a
wall
not
one
that
have
to
preserve
battery
life
so
tony
fadell
argue
strongly
for
something
base
on
the
arm
architecture
which
be
simpler
and
use
less
power
apple
have
be
an
early
partner
with
arm
and
chip
use
its
architecture
be
in
the
original
iphone
fadell
gather
support
from
other
engineer
and
prove
that
it
be
possible
to
confront
job
and
turn
him
around
wrong
wrong
wrong
fadell
shout
at
one
meeting
when
job
insist
it
be
best
to
trust
intel
to
make
a
good
mobile
chip
fadell
even
put
his
apple
badge
on
the
table
threaten
to
resign
eventually
job
relent
i
hear
you
he
say
i
m
not
go
to
go
against
my
best
guy
in
fact
he
go
to
the
other
extreme
apple
license
the
arm
architecture
but
it
also
bought
a
person
microprocessor
design
firm
in
palo
alto
call
p
a
semi
and
have
it
create
a
custom
system
on
a
chip
call
the
a
which
be
base
on
the
arm
architecture
and
manufacture
in
south
korea
by
samsung
as
job
recall
at
the
high
performance
end
intel
be
the
best
they
build
the
fast
chip
if
you
don
t
care
about
power
and
cost
but
they
build
just
the
processor
on
one
chip
so
it
take
a
lot
of
other
part
our
a
have
the
processor
and
the
graphic
mobile
operating
system
and
memory
control
all
in
the
chip
we
try
to
help
intel
but
they
don
t
listen
much
we
ve
be
tell
them
for
year
that
their
graphic
suck
every
quarter
we
schedule
a
meeting
with
me
and
our
top
three
guy
and
paul
otellini
at
the
begin
we
be
do
wonderful
thing
together
they
want
this
big
joint
project
to
do
chip
for
future
iphones
there
be
two
reason
we
didn
t
go
with
them
one
be
that
they
be
just
really
slow
they
re
like
a
steamship
not
very
flexible
we
re
use
to
go
pretty
fast
second
be
that
we
just
didn
t
want
to
teach
them
everything
which
they
could
go
and
sell
to
our
competitor
accord
to
otellini
it
would
have
make
sense
for
the
ipad
to
use
intel
chip
the
problem
he
say
be
that
apple
and
intel
couldn
t
agree
on
price
also
they
disagreed
on
who
would
control
the
design
it
be
another
example
of
job
s
desire
indeed
compulsion
to
control
every
aspect
of
a
product
from
the
silicon
to
the
flesh
the
launch
january
the
usual
excitement
that
job
be
able
to
gin
up
for
a
product
launch
pal
in
comparison
to
the
frenzy
that
built
for
the
ipad
unveil
on
january
in
san
francisco
the
economist
put
him
on
its
cover
robed
haloed
and
hold
what
be
dubbed
the
jesus
tablet
the
wall
street
journal
struck
a
similarly
exalt
note
the
last
time
there
be
this
much
excitement
about
a
tablet
it
have
some
commandment
write
on
it
as
if
to
underscore
the
historic
nature
of
the
launch
job
invite
back
many
of
the
old
timer
from
his
early
apple
day
more
poignantly
james
eason
who
have
perform
his
liver
transplant
the
year
before
and
jeffrey
norton
who
have
operate
on
his
pancreas
in
be
in
the
audience
sit
with
his
wife
his
son
and
mona
simpson
job
do
his
usual
masterly
job
of
put
a
new
device
into
context
as
he
have
do
for
the
iphone
three
year
earlier
this
time
he
put
up
a
screen
that
show
an
iphone
and
a
laptop
with
a
question
mark
in
between
the
question
be
be
there
room
for
something
in
the
middle
he
ask
that
something
would
have
to
be
good
at
web
browsing
email
photo
video
music
game
and
ebooks
he
drove
a
stake
through
the
heart
of
the
netbook
concept
netbooks
aren
t
well
at
anything
he
say
the
invite
guest
and
employee
cheer
but
we
have
something
that
be
we
call
it
the
ipad
to
underscore
the
casual
nature
of
the
ipad
job
amble
over
to
a
comfortable
leather
chair
and
side
table
actually
give
his
taste
it
be
a
le
corbusier
chair
and
an
eero
saarinen
table
and
scoop
one
up
it
s
so
much
more
intimate
than
a
laptop
he
enthuse
he
proceed
to
surf
to
the
new
york
time
website
send
an
email
to
scott
forstall
and
phil
schiller
wow
we
really
be
announce
the
ipad
flip
through
a
photo
album
use
a
calendar
zoom
in
on
the
eiffel
tower
on
google
map
watch
some
video
clip
star
trek
and
pixar
s
up
show
off
the
ibook
shelf
and
play
a
song
bob
dylan
s
like
a
roll
stone
which
he
have
played
at
the
iphone
launch
isn
t
that
awesome
he
ask
with
his
final
slide
job
emphasize
one
of
the
theme
of
his
life
which
be
embody
by
the
ipad
a
sign
show
the
corner
of
technology
street
and
liberal
art
street
the
reason
apple
can
create
product
like
the
ipad
be
that
we
ve
always
try
to
be
at
the
intersection
of
technology
and
liberal
art
he
conclude
the
ipad
be
the
digital
reincarnation
of
the
whole
earth
catalog
the
place
where
creativity
met
tool
for
living
for
once
the
initial
reaction
be
not
a
hallelujah
chorus
the
ipad
be
not
yet
available
it
would
go
on
sale
in
april
and
some
who
watch
job
s
demo
be
not
quite
sure
what
it
be
an
iphone
on
steroid
i
haven
t
be
this
let
down
since
snooki
hooked
up
with
the
situation
write

s
daniel
lyon
who
moonlight
as

eight

that
suck
about
the

no
multitasking
no

no

even
the

in
for
ridicule
in

with
snarky
comment
about

the
hashtag

the
number
three
trend
topic
on
twitter
that
day
there
be
also
the
requisite
dismissal
from
bill
gate
i
still
think
that
some
mixture
of
voice
the
pen
and
a
real
keyboard
in
other
word
a
netbook
will
be
the
mainstream
he
told
brent
schlender
so
it
s
not
like
i
sit
there
and
feel
the
same
way
i
do
with
the
iphone
where
i
say
oh
my
god
microsoft
didn
t
aim
high
enough
it
s
a
nice
reader
but
there
s
nothing
on
the
ipad
i
look
at
and
say
oh
i
wish
microsoft
have
do
it
he
continued
to
insist
that
the
microsoft
approach
of
use
a
stylus
for
input
would
prevail
i
ve
be

a

told
me
i
will
eventually
turn
out
to
be
right
or
be
dead
the
night
after
his
announcement

be
annoyed

depressed
as
we
gather
in

great
about

everything
daniel
lyon
who
have
zapped
it
with
his
snooki
comment
at
the
launch
revise
his
opinion
my
first
thought
as
i
watch
job
run
through
his
demo
be
that
it
seem
like
no
big
deal
he
write
it
s
a
big
version
of
the
ipod
touch
right
then
i
get
a
chance
to
use
an
ipad
and
it
hit
me
i
want
one
lyon
like
others
realize
that
this
be
job
s
pet
project
and
it
embody
all
that
he
stood
for
he
have
an
uncanny
ability
to
cook
up
gadget
that
we
didn
t
know
we
need
but
then
suddenly
can
t
live
without
he
write
a
close
system
may
be
the
only
way
to
deliver
the
kind
of
techno

experience
that
apple
have
become
know
for

of

start
to

a
debate
on
this
issue
in

this
more
convincingly
than

they
agree
that
the

be

be
fast
pace
with
vibrant

it
s
only
just
begin
once
the

ad
have
run
their
course
the
team
again
try
something
softer
shot
as

in
the
life
documentary
by
the
young
filmmaker
jessica
sander
job
like
them
for
a
little
while
then
he
turn
against
them
for
the
same
reason
he
have
react
against
the
original
pottery
barn
style
ad
dammit
he
shout
they
look
like
a
visa
commercial
typical
ad
agency
stuff
he
have
be
ask
for
ad
that
be
different
and
new
but
eventually
he
realize
he
do
not
want
to
stray
from
what
he
consider
the
apple
voice
for
him
that
voice
have
a
distinctive
set
of
quality
simple
declarative
clean
we
go
down
that
lifestyle
path
and
it
seem
to
be
grow
on
steve
and
suddenly
he
say
i
hate
that
stuff
it
s
not
apple
recall
lee
clow
he
told
us
to
get
back
to
the
apple
voice
it
s
a
very
simple
honest
voice
and
so
they
go
back
to
a
clean
white
background
with
just
a
close
up
show
off
all
the
thing
that
ipad
be
and
could
do
apps
the
ipad
commercial
be
not
about
the
device
but
about
what
you
could
do
with
it
indeed
its
success
come
not
just
from
the
beauty
of
the
hardware
but
from
the
application
know
as
apps
that
allow
you
to
indulge
in
all
sort
of
delightful
activity
there
be
thousand
and
soon
hundred
of
thousand
of
apps
that
you
could
download
for
free
or
for
a
few
dollar
you
could
sling
angry
bird
with
the
swipe
of
your
finger
track
your
stock
watch
movie
read
book
and
magazine
catch
up
on
the
news
play
game
and
waste
glorious
amount
of
time
once
again
the
integration
of
the
hardware
software
and
store
make
it
easy
but
the
apps
also
allow
the
platform
to
be
sort
of
open
in
a
very
control
way
to
outside
developer
who
want
to
create
software
and
content
for
it
open
that
be
like
a
carefully
curated
and
gate
community
garden
the
apps
phenomenon
begin
with
the
iphone
when
it
first
come
out
in
early
there
be
no
apps
you
could
buy
from
outside
developer
and
job
initially
resist
allow
them
he
didn
t
want
outsider
to
create
application
for
the
iphone
that
could
mess
it
up
infect
it
with
virus
or
pollute
its
integrity
board
member
art
levinson
be
among
those
push
to
allow
iphone
apps
i
call
him
a
half
dozen
time
to
lobby
for
the
potential
of
the
apps
he
recall
if
apple
didn
t
allow
them
indeed
encourage
them
another
smartphone
maker
would
give
itself
a
competitive
advantage
apple
s
marketing
chief
phil
schiller
agree
i
couldn
t
imagine
that
we
would
create
something
as
powerful
as
the
iphone
and
not
empower
developer
to
make
lot
of
apps
he
recall
i
knew
customer
would
love
them
from
the
outside
the
venture
capitalist
john
doerr
argue
that
permit
apps
would
spawn
a
profusion
of
new
entrepreneur
who
would
create
new
service
job
at
first
quashed
the
discussion
partly
because
he
felt
his
team
do
not
have
the
bandwidth
to
figure
out
all
of
the
complexity
that
would
be
involve
in
police
third
party
app
developer
he
want
focus
so
he
didn
t
want
to
talk
about
it
say
schiller
but
as
soon
as
the
iphone
be
launch
he
be
willing
to
hear
the

the

also
meant
that
the

nature
of

be
sacrifice
apps
be
not

with
the

job
have
transform
the

business
with

its

he
begin
to
transform
all
medium
from
publishing
to
journalism
to
television
and
movie
book
be
an
obvious
target
since
amazon
s
kindle
have
show
there
be
an
appetite
for
electronic
book
so
apple
create
an
ibooks
store
which
sell
electronic
book
the
way
the
itunes
store
sell
song
there
be
however
a
slight
difference
in
the
business
model
for
the
itunes
store
job
have
insist
that
all
song
be
sell
at
one
inexpensive
price
initially
cent
amazon
s
jeff
bezos
have
try
to
take
a
similar
approach
with
ebooks
insist
on
sell
them
for
at
most
job
come
in
and
offer
publisher
what
he
have
refuse
to
offer
record
company
they
could
set
any
price
they
want
for
their
ware
in
the
ibooks
store
and
apple
would
take
initially
that
meant
price
be
high
than
on
amazon
why
would
people
pay
apple
more
that
won
t
be
the
case
job
answer
when
walt
mossberg
ask
him
that
question
at
the
ipad
launch
event
the
price
will
be
the
same
he
be
right
the
day
after
the
ipad
launch
job
described
to
me
his
think
on
book
amazon
screw
it
up
it
paid
the
wholesale
price
for
some
book
but
start
sell
them
below
cost
at
the
publisher
hat
that
they
thought
it
would
trash
their
ability
to
sell
hardcover
book
at
so
before
apple
even
get
on
the
scene
some
bookseller
be
start
to
withhold
book
from
amazon
so
we
told
the
publisher
we
ll
go
to
the
agency
model
where
you
set
the
price
and
we
get
our
and
yes
the
customer
pay
a
little
more
but
that
s
what
you
want
anyway
but
we
also
ask
for
a
guarantee
that
if
anybody
else
be
sell
the
book
cheaper
than
we
be
then
we
can
sell
them
at
the
low
price
too
so
they
go
to
amazon
and
say
you
re
go
to
sign
an
agency
contract
or
we
re
not
go
to
give
you
the
book
job
acknowledge
that
he
be
try
to
have
it
both
way
when
it
come
to
music
and
book
he
have
refuse
to
offer
the
music
company
the
agency
model
and
allow
them
to
set
their
own
price
why
because
he
didn
t
have
to
but
with
book
he
do
we
be
not
the
first
people
in
the
book
business
he
say
give
the
situation
that
exist
what
be
best
for
us
be
to
do
this
akido
move
and
end
up
with
the
agency
model
and
we
pull
it
off
right
after
the
ipad
launch
event
job
travel
to
new
york
in
february
to
meet
with
executive
in
the
journalism
business
in
two
day
he
saw
rupert
murdoch
his
son
james
and
the
management
of
their
wall
street
journal
arthur
sulzberger
jr
and
the
top
executive
at
the
new
york
time
and
executive
at
time
fortune
and
other
time
inc
magazine
i
would
love
to
help
quality
journalism
he
later
say
we
can
t
depend
on
blogger
for
our
news
we
need
real
reporting
and
editorial
oversight
more
than
ever
so
i
d
love
to
find
a
way
to
help
people
create
digital
product
where
they
actually
can
make
money
since
he
have
gotten
people
to
pay
for
music
he
hop
he
could
do
the
same
for
journalism
publisher
however
turn
out
to
be
leery
of
his
lifeline
it
meant
that
they
would
have
to
give
of
their
revenue
to
apple
but
that
wasn
t
the
big
problem
more
important
the
publisher
fear
that
under
his
system
they
would
no
longer
have
a
direct
relationship
with
their
subscriber
they
wouldn
t
have
their
email
address
and
credit
card
number
so
they
could
bill
them
communicate
with
them
and
market
new
product
to
them
instead
apple
would
own
the
customer
bill
them
and
have
their
information
in
its
own
database
and
because
of
its
privacy
policy
apple
would
not
share
this
information
unless
a
customer
give
explicit
permission
to
do
so
job
be
particularly
interested
in
strike
a
deal
with
the
new
york
time
which
he
felt
be
a
great
newspaper
in
danger
of
decline
because
it
have
not
figure
out
how
to
charge
for
digital
content
one
of
my
personal
project
this
year
i
ve
decide
be
to
try
to
help
whether
they
want
it
or
not
the
time
he
told
me
early
in
i
think
it
s
important
to
the
country
for
them
to
figure
it
out
during
his
new
york
trip
he
go
to
dinner
with
fifty
top
time
executive
in
the
cellar
private
din
room
at
pranna
an
asian
restaurant
he
order
a
mango
smoothie
and
a
plain
vegan
pasta
neither
of
which
be
on
the
menu
there
he
show
off
the
ipad
and
explain
how
important
it
be
to
find
a
modest
price
point
for
digital
content
that
consumer
would
accept
he
drew
a
chart
of
possible
price
and
volume
how
many
reader
would
they
have
if
the
time
be
free
they
already
knew
the
answer
to
that
extreme
on
the
chart
because
they
be
give
it
away
for
free
on
the
web
already
and
have
about
twenty
million
regular
visitor
and
if
they
make
it
really
expensive
they
have
data
on
that
too
they
charge
print
subscriber
more
than
a
year
and
have
about
a
million
of
them
you
should
go
after
the
midpoint
which
be
about
ten
million
digital
subscriber
he
told
them
and
that
mean
your
digital
sub
should
be
very
cheap
and
simple
one
click
and
a
month
at
most
when
one
of
the
time
circulation
executive
insist
that
the
paper
need
the
email
and
credit
card
information
for
all
of
its
subscriber
even
if
they
subscribed
through
the
app
store
job
say
that
apple
would
not
give
it
out
that
angered
the
executive
it
be
unthinkable
he
say
for
the
time
not
to
have
that
information
well
you
can
ask
them
for
it
but
if
they
won
t
voluntarily
give
it
to
you
don
t
blame
me

of
apple
s
privacy
policy

well
then
we

to

i

whole

become
subscriber
of
yours

then
aggregate
at
the
apple
store
say
bewkes
and
the
next
thing
you
ll
do
once
you
have
a
monopoly
be
come
back
and
tell
me
that
my
magazine
shouldn
t
be
a
copy
but
instead
should
be
if
someone
subscribes
to
our
magazine
we
need
to
know
who
it
be
we
need
to
be
able
to
create
online
community
of
those
people
and
we
need
the
right
to
pitch
them
directly
about
renew
job
have
an
easy
time
with
rupert
murdoch
whose
news
corp
own
the
wall
street
journal
new
york
post
newspaper
around
the
world
fox
studio
and
the
fox
news
channel
when
job
met
with
murdoch
and
his
team
they
also
press
the
case
that
they
should
share
ownership
of
the
subscriber
that
come
in
through
the
app
store
but
when
job
refuse
something
interest
happen
murdoch
be
not
know
as
a
pushover
but
he
knew
that
he
do
not
have
the
leverage
on
this
issue
so
he
accepted
job
s
term
we
would
prefer
to
own
the
subscriber
and
we
push
for
that
recall
murdoch
but
steve
wouldn
t
do
a
deal
on
those
term
so
i
say
okay
let
s
get
on
with
it
we
didn
t
see
any
reason
to
mess
around
he
wasn
t
go
to
bend
and
i
wouldn
t
have
bent
if
i
be
in
his
position
so
i
just
say
yes
murdoch
even
launch
a
digital
only
daily
newspaper
the
daily
tailor
specifically
for
the
ipad
it
would
be
sell
in
the
app
store
on
the
term
dictate
by
job
at
cent
a
week
murdoch
himself
take
a
team
to
cupertino
to
show
the
propose
design
not
surprisingly
job
hat
it
would
you
allow
our
designer
to
help
he
ask
murdoch
accepted
the
apple
designer
have
a
crack
at
it
murdoch
recall
and
our
folk
go
back
and
have
another
crack
and
ten
day
later
we
go
back
and
show
them
both
and
he
actually
like
our
team
s
version
well
it
stun
us
the
daily
which
be
neither
tabloidy
nor
serious
but
instead
a
rather
midmarket
product
like
usa
today
be
not
very
successful
but
it
do
help
create
an
odd
couple
bonding
between
job
and
murdoch
when
murdoch
ask
him
to
speak
at
his
june
news
corp
annual
management
retreat
job
make
an
exception
to
his
rule
of
never
do
such
appearance
james
murdoch
lead
him
in
an
after
dinner
interview
that
last
almost
two
hour
he
be
very
blunt
and
critical
of
what
newspaper
be
do
in
technology
murdoch
recall
he
told
us
we
be
go
to
find
it
hard
to
get
thing
right
because
you
re
in
new
york
and
anyone
who
s
any
good
at
tech
work
in
silicon
valley
this
do
not
go
down
very
well
with
the
president
of
the
wall
street
journal
digital
network
gordon
mcleod
who
push
back
a
bit
at
the
end
mcleod
come
up
to
job
and
say
thanks
it
be
a
wonderful
even
but
you
probably
just
cost
me
my
job
murdoch
chuckle
a
bit
when
he
described
the
scene
to
me
it
end
up
be
true
he
say
mcleod
be
out
within
three
month
in
return
for
speak
at
the
retreat
job
get
murdoch
to
hear
him
out
on
fox
news
which
he
believe
be
destructive
harmful
to
the
nation
and
a
blot
on
murdoch
s
reputation
you
re
blowing
it
with
fox
news
job
told
him
over
dinner
the
axis
today
be
not
liberal
and
conservative
the
axis
be
constructive
destructive
and
you
ve
cast
your
lot
with
the
destructive
people
fox
have
become
an
incredibly
destructive
force
in
our
society
you
can
be
well
and
this
be
go
to
be
your
legacy
if
you
re
not
careful
job
say
he
thought
murdoch
do
not
really
like
how
far
fox
have
go
rupert
s
a
builder
not
a
tearer
downer
he
say
i
ve
have
some
meeting
with
james
and
i
think
he
agrees
with
me
i
can
just
tell
murdoch
later
say
he
be
use
to
people
like
job
complain
about
fox
he
s
get
sort
of
a
left
wing
view
on
this
he
say
job
ask
him
to
have
his
folk
make
a
reel
of
a
week
of
sean
hannity
and
glenn
beck
show
he
thought
that
they
be
more
destructive
than
bill
o
reilly
and
murdoch
agree
to
do
so
job
later
told
me
that
he
be
go
to
ask
jon
stewart
s
team
to
put
together
a
similar
reel
for
murdoch
to
watch
i
d
be
happy
to
see
it
murdoch
say
but
he
hasn
t
sent
it
to
me
murdoch
and
job
hit
it
off
well
enough
that
murdoch
go
to
his
palo
alto
house
for
dinner
twice
more
during
the
next
year
job
joked
that
he
have
to
hide
the
dinner
knife
on
such
occasion
because
he
be
afraid
that
his
liberal
wife
be
go
to
eviscerate
murdoch
when
he
walk
in
for
his
part
murdoch
be
report
to
have
uttered
a
great
line
about
the
organic
vegan
dish
typically
serve
eat
dinner
at
steve
s
be
a
great
experience
as
long
as
you
get
out
before
the
local
restaurant
close
ala
when
i
ask
murdoch
if
he
have
ever
say
that
he
didn
t
recall
it
one
visit
come
early
in
murdoch
be
due
to
pas
through
palo
alto
on
february
and
he
texted
job
to
tell
him
so
he
didn
t
know
it
be
job
s
fifty
sixth
birthday
and
job
didn
t
mention
it
when
he
texted
back
invite
him
to
dinner
it
be
my
way
of
make
sure
laurene
didn
t
veto
the
plan
job
joked
it
be
my
birthday
so
she
have
to
let
me
have
rupert
over
erin
and
eve
be
there
and
reed
jogged
over
from
stanford
near
the
end
of
the
dinner
job
show
off
the
design
for
his
plan
boat
which
murdoch
thought
look
beautiful
on
the
inside
but
a
bit
plain
on
the
outside
it
certainly
show
great
optimism
about
his
health
that
he
be
talk
so
much
about
building
it
murdoch
later
say
at
dinner
they
talk
about
the
importance
of
infuse
an
entrepreneurial
and
nimble
culture
into
a
company
sony
fail
to
do
that
murdoch
say
job
agree
i
use
to
believe
that
a
really
big
company
couldn
t
have
a
clear
corporate
culture
job
say
but
i
now
believe
it
can
be
do
murdoch
s
do
it
i
think
i
ve
do
it
at
apple
most
of
the
dinner
conversation
be
about
education
murdoch
have
just
hire
joel
klein
the
former
chancellor
of
the
new
york
city
department
of
education
to
start
a
digital
curriculum
division
murdoch
recall
that
job
be
somewhat
dismissive
of
the
idea
that
technology
could
transform
education
but
job
agree
with
murdoch
that
the
paper
textbook
business
would
be
blown
away
by
digital
learn
material
in
fact
job
have
his
sight
set
on
textbook
as
the
next
business
he
want
to
transform
he
believe
it
be
an
billion
a
year
industry
ripe
for
digital
destruction
he
be
also
struck
by
the
fact
that
many
school
for
security
reason
don
t
have
locker
so
kid
have
to
lug
a
heavy
backpack
around
the
ipad
would
solve
that
he
say
his
idea
be
to
hire
great
textbook
writer
to
create
digital
version
and
make
them
a
feature
of
the
ipad
in
addition
he
held
meeting
with
the
major
publisher
such
as
pearson
education
about
partner
with
apple
the
process
by
which
state
certify
textbook
be
corrupt
he
say
but
if
we
can
make
the
textbook
free
and
they
come
with
the
ipad
then
they
don
t
have
to
be
certify
the
crappy
economy
at
the
state
level
will
last
for
a
decade
and
we
can
give
them
an
opportunity
to
circumvent
that
whole
process
and
save
money
chapter
thirty
nine
new
battle
and
echo
of
old
one

day
after

a
town
hall
meeting
with

about

go
into
a
rant
against

no

they
want
to
kill
the
iphone
we
won

do
most
of
the
talk
google
have
ripped
him
off
he
say
in
colorful
language
we
ve
get
you
red
hand
he
told
schmidt
i
m
not
interested
in

i
don
t
want
your
money
if
you
offer
me
billion
i
won
t
want
it
i
ve
get
plenty
of
money
i
want
you
to
stop
use
our
idea
in
android
that
s
all
i
want
they
resolve
nothing
underlie
the
dispute
be
an
even
more
fundamental
issue
one
that
have
unnerve
historical
resonance
google
present
android
as
an
open
platform
its
open
source
code
be
freely
available
for
multiple
hardware
maker
to
use
on
whatever
phone
or
tablet
they
built
job
of
course
have
a
dogmatic
belief
that
apple
should
closely
integrate
its
operating
system
with
its
hardware
in
the
s
apple
have
not
license
out
its
macintosh
operating
system
and
microsoft
eventually
gain
dominant
market
share
by
licensing
its
system
to
multiple
hardware
maker
and
in
job
s
mind
rip
off
apple
s
interface
the
comparison
between
what
microsoft
wrought
in
the
s
and
what
google
be
try
to
do
in
be
not
exact
but
it
be
close
enough
to
be
unsettle
and
infuriate
it
exemplify
the
great
debate
of
the
digital
age
close
versus
open
or
as
job
frame
it
integrate
versus
fragment
be
it
well
as
apple
believe
and
as
job
s
own
control
perfectionism
almost
compel
to
tie
the
hardware
and
software
and
content
handle
into
one
tidy
system
that
assure
a
simple
user
experience
or
be
it
well
to
give
user
and
manufacturer
more
choice
and
free
up
avenue
for
more
innovation
by
create
software
system
that
could
be
modify
and
use
on
different
device
steve
have
a
particular
way
that
he
want
to
run
apple
and
it
s
the
same
as
it
be
twenty
year
ago
which
be
that
apple
be
a
brilliant
innovator
of
close
system
schmidt
later
told
me
they
don
t
want
people
to
be
on
their
platform
without
permission
the
benefit
of
a
close
platform
be
control
but
google
have
a
specific
belief
that
open
be
the
well
approach
because
it
lead
to
more
option
and
competition
and
consumer
choice
so
what
do
bill
gate
think
as
he
watch
job
with
his
close
strategy
go
into
battle
against
google
as
he
have
do
against
microsoft
twenty
five
year
earlier
there
be
some
benefit
to
be
more
close
in
term
of
how
much
you
control
the
experience
and
certainly
at
time
he
s
have
the
benefit
of
that
gate
told
me
but
refuse
to
license
the
apple
io
he
add
give
competitor
like
android
the
chance
to
gain
great
volume
in
addition
he
argue
competition
among
a
variety
of
device
and
manufacturer
lead
to
great
consumer
choice
and
more
innovation
these
company
be
not
all
building
pyramid
next
to
central
park
he
say
poke
fun
at
apple
s
fifth
avenue
store
but
they
be
come
up
with
innovation
base
on
compete
for
consumer
most
of
the
improvement
in
pc
gate
point
out
come
because
consumer
have
a
lot
of
choice
and
that
would
someday
be
the
case
in
the
world
of
mobile
device
eventually
i
think
open
will
succeed
but
that
s
where
i
come
from
in
the
long
run
the
coherence
thing
you
can
t
stay
with
that
job
believe
in
the
coherence
thing
his
faith
in
a
control
and
close
environment
remain
unwavering
even
as
android
gain
market
share
google
say
we
exert
more
control
than
they
do
that
we
be
close
and
they
be
open
he
rail
when
i
told
him
what
schmidt
have
say
well
look
at
the
result
android
s
a
mess
it
have
different
screen
size
and
version
over
a
hundred
permutation
even
if
google
s
approach
might
eventually
win
in
the
marketplace
job
found
it
repellent
i
like
be
responsible
for
the
whole
user
experience
we
do
it
not
to
make
money
we
do
it
because
we
want
to
make
great
product
not
crap
like
android
flash
the
app
store
and
control
job
s
insistence
on
end
to
end
control
be
manifest
in
other
battle
as
well
at
the
town
hall
meeting
where
he
attack
google
he
also
assail
adobe
s
multimedia
platform
for
website
flash
as
a
buggy
battery
hog
make
by
lazy
people
the
ipod
and
iphone
he
say
would
never
run
flash
flash
be
a
spaghetti
ball
piece
of
technology
that
have
lousy
performance
and
really
bad
security
problem
he
say
to
me
later
that
week
he
even
ban
apps
that
make
use
of
a
compiler
create
by
adobe
that
translate
flash
code
so
that
it
would
be
compatible
with
apple
s
io
job
disdain
the
use
of
compiler
that
allow
developer
to
write
their
product
once
and
have
them
port
to
multiple
operating
system
allow
flash
to
be
port
across
platform
mean
thing
get
dumbed
down
to
the
low
common
denominator
he
say
we
spend
lot
of
effort
to
make
our
platform
well
and
the
developer
doesn
t
get
any
benefit
if
adobe
only
work
with
function
that
every
platform
have
so
we
say
that
we
want
developer
to
take
advantage
of
our
well
feature
so
that
their
apps
work
well
on
our
platform
than
they
work
on
anybody
else
s
on
that
he
be
right
lose
the
ability
to
differentiate
apple
s
platform
allow
them
to
become
commoditized
like
hp
and
dell
machine
would
have
meant
death
for
the
company
there
be
in
addition
a
more
personal
reason
apple
have
invest
in
adobe
in
and
together
the
two
company
have
launch
the
desktop
publishing
revolution
i
help
put
adobe
on
the
map
job
claimed
in
after
he
return
to
apple
he
have
ask
adobe
to
start
make
its
video
edit
software
and
other
product
for
the
imac
and
its
new
operating
system
but
adobe
refuse
it
focus
on
make
its
product
for
window
soon
after
its
founder
john
warnock
retire
the
soul
of
adobe
disappear
when
warnock
left
job
say
he
be
the
inventor
the
person
i
related
to
it
s
be
a
bunch
of
suit
since
then
and
the
company
have
turn
out
crap
when
adobe
evangelist
and
various
flash
supporter
in
the
blogosphere
attack
job
for
be
too
control
he
decide
to
write
and
post
an
open
letter
bill
campbell
his
friend
and
board
member
come
by
his
house
to
go
over
it
do
it
sound
like
i
m
just
try
to
stick
it
to
adobe
he
ask
campbell
no
it
s
fact
just
put
it
out
there
the
coach
say
most
of
the
letter
focus
on
the
technical
drawback
of
flash
but
despite
campbell
s
coach
job
couldn
t
resist
vent
at
the
end
about
the
problematic
history
between
the
two
company
adobe
be
the
last
major
third
party
developer
to
fully
adopt
mac
o
x
he
note
apple
end
up
lift
some
of
its
restriction
on
cross
platform
compiler
later
in
the
year
and
adobe
be
able
to
come
out
with
a
flash
author
tool
that
take
advantage
of
the
key
feature
of
apple
s
io
it
be
a
bitter
war
but
one
in
which
job
have
the
well
argument
in
the
end
it
push
adobe
and
other
developer
of
compiler
to
make
well
use
of
the
iphone
and
ipad
interface
and
its
special
feature
job
have
a
tougher
time
navigate
the
controversy
over
apple
s
desire
to
keep
tight
control
over
which
apps
could
be

iphone
and
ipad
guard
against
apps
that
contain
virus
or
violate
the
user
s
privacy
make
sense
prevent
apps
that
take
user
to
other
website
to
buy
subscription
rather
than
do
it
through
the
itunes
store
at
least
have
a
business
rationale
but
job
and
his
team
go
far
they
decide
to
ban
any
app
that
defame
people
might
be
politically
explosive
or
be
deem
by
apple
s
censor
to
be
pornographic
the
problem
of
play
nanny
become
apparent
when
apple
reject
an
app
feature
the
animate
political
cartoon
of

the
rationale
that
his

policy
on
torture
violate
the
restriction
against
defamation
its
decision
become
public
and
be
subject
to
ridicule
when
fiore
won
the
pulitzer
prize
for
editorial
cartoon
in
april
apple
have
to
reverse
itself

we
thought
this

it
be
more
than
a

it
raise
the
specter
of
apple

control
what
apps
we
get

the
question
of
whether
control
freakiness
have
combine
with
arrogance
jon
stewart
be
a
friend
of
job
and
an
apple
fan
job
have
visit
him
privately
in
february
when
he
take
his
trip
to
new
york
to
meet
with
medium
executive
but
that
didn
t
stop
stewart
from
go
after
him
on
the
daily
show
it
wasn
t
suppose
to
be
this
way
microsoft
be
suppose
to
be
the
evil
one
stewart
say
only
half
jokingly
behind
him
the
word
appholes
appear
on
the
screen
you
guy
be
the
rebel
man
the
underdog
but
now
be
you
become
the
man
remember
back
in
you
have
those
awesome
ad
about
overthrow
big
brother
look
in
the
mirror
man
by
late
spring
the
issue
be
be
discuss
among
board
member
there
be
an
arrogance
art
levinson
told
me
over
lunch
just
after
he
have
raise
it
at
a
meeting
it
tie
into
steve
s
personality
he
can
react
viscerally
and
lay
out
his
conviction
in
a
forceful
manner
such
arrogance
be
fine
when
apple
be
the
feisty
underdog
but
now
apple
be
dominant
in
the
mobile
market
we
need
to
make
the
transition
to
be
a
big
company
and
deal
with
the
hubris
issue
say
levinson
al
gore
also
talk
about
the
problem
at
board
meeting
the
context
for
apple
be
change
dramatically
he
recount
it
s
not
hammer
thrower
against
big
brother
now
apple
s
big
and
people
see
it
as
arrogant
job
become
defensive
when
the
topic
be
raise
he
s
still
adjust
to
it
say
gore
he
s
well
at
be
the
underdog
than
be
a
humble
giant
job
have
little
patience
for
such
talk
the
reason
apple
be
be
criticize
he
told
me
then
be
that
company
like
google
and
adobe
be
lie
about
us
and
try
to
tear
us
down
what
do
he
think
of
the
suggestion
that
apple
sometimes
act
arrogantly
i
m
not
worried
about
that
he
say
because
we
re
not
arrogant
antennagate
design
versus
engineering
in
many
consumer
product
company
there
s
tension
between
the
designer
who
want
to
make
a
product
look
beautiful
and
the
engineer
who
need
to
make
sure
it
fulfills
its
functional
requirement
at
apple
where
job
push
both
design
and
engineering
to
the
edge
that
tension
be
even
great
when
he
and
design
director
jony
ive
become
creative
coconspirator
back
in
they
tend
to
view
the
qualm
express
by
engineer
as
evidence
of
a
can
t
do
attitude
that
need
to
be
overcome
their
faith
that
awesome
design
could
force
superhuman
feat
of
engineering
be
reinforce
by
the
success
of
the
imac
and
ipod
when
engineer
say
something
couldn
t
be
do
ive
and
job
push
them
to
try
and
usually
they
succeed
there
be
occasional
small
problem
the
ipod
nano
for
example
be
prone
to
get
scratch
because
ive
believe
that
a
clear
coat
would
lessen
the
purity
of
his
design
but
that
be
not
a
crisis
when
it
come
to
design
the
iphone
ive
s
design
desire
bumped
into
a
fundamental
law
of
physic
that
could
not
be
change
even
by
a
reality
distortion
field
metal
be
not
a
great
material
to
put
near
an
antenna
as
michael
faraday
show
electromagnetic
wave
flow
around
the
surface
of
metal
not
through
it
so
a
metal
enclosure
around
a
phone
can
create
what
be
know
as
a
faraday
cage
diminish
the
signal
that
get
in
or
out
the
original
iphone
start
with
a
plastic
band
at
the
bottom
but
ive
thought
that
would
wreck
the
design
integrity
and
ask
that
there
be
an
aluminum
rim
all
around
after
that
end
up
work
out
ive
design
the
iphone
with
a
steel
rim
the
steel
would
be
the
structural
support
look
really
sleek
and
serve
as
part
of
the
phone
s
antenna
there
be
significant
challenge
in
order
to
serve
as
an
antenna
the
steel
rim
have
to
have
a
tiny
gap
but
if
a
person
cover
that
gap
with
a
finger
or
sweaty
palm
there
could
be
some
signal
loss
the
engineer
suggest
a
clear
coat
over
the
metal
to
help
prevent
this
but
again
ive
felt
that
this
would
detract
from
the
brush
metal
look
the
issue
be
present
to
job
at
various
meeting
but
he
thought
the
engineer
be
cry
wolf
you
can
make
this
work
he
say
and
so
they
do
and
it
work
almost
perfectly
but
not
totally
perfectly
when
the
iphone
be
release
in
june
it
look
awesome
but
a
problem
soon
become
evident
if
you
held
the
phone
a
certain
way
especially
use
your
left
hand
so
your
palm
cover
the
tiny
gap
you
could
lose
your
connection
it
occur
with
perhaps
one
in
a
hundred
call
because
job
insist
on
keep
his
unreleased
product
secret
even
the
phone
that
gizmodo
score
in
a
bar
have
a
fake
case
around
it
the
iphone
do
not
go
through
the
live
test
that
most
electronic
device
get
so
the
flaw
be
not
caught
before
the
massive
rush
to
buy
it
begin
the
question
be
whether
the
twin
policy
of
put
design
in
front
of
engineering
and
have
a
policy
of
supersecrecy
surround
unreleased
product
help
apple
tony
fadell
say
later
on
the
whole
yes
but
unchecked
power
be
a
bad
thing
and
that
s
what
happen
have
it
not
be
the
apple
iphone
a
product
that
have
everyone
transfixed
the
issue
of
a
few
extra
drop
call
would
not
have
make
news
but
it
become
know
as
antennagate
and
it
boil
to
a
head
in
early
july
when
consumer
report
do
some
rigorous
test
and
say
that
it
could
not
recommend
the
iphone
because
of
the
antenna
problem
job
be
in
kona
village
hawaii
with
his
family
when
the
issue
arose
at
first
he
be
defensive
art
levinson
be
in
constant
contact
by
phone
and
job
insist
that
the
problem
stem
from
google
and
motorola
make
mischief
they
want
to
shoot
apple
down
he
say
levinson
urge
a
little
humility
let
s
try
to
figure
out
if
there
s
something
wrong
he
say
when
he
again
mention
the
perception
that
apple
be
arrogant
job
didn
t
like
it
it
go
against
his
black
white
right
wrong
way
of
view
the
world
apple
be
a
company
of
principle
he
felt
if
others
fail
to
see
that
it
be
their
fault
not
a
reason
for
apple
to
play
humble
job
s
second
reaction
be
to
be
hurt
he
take
the
criticism
personally
and
become
emotionally
anguish
at
his
core
he
doesn
t
do
thing
that
he
think
be
blatantly
wrong
like
some
pure
pragmatist
in
our
business
levinson
say
so
if
he
feel
he
s
right
he
will
just
charge
ahead
rather
than
question
himself
levinson
urge
him
not
to
get
depressed
but
job
do
fuck
this
it
s
not
worth
it
he
told
levinson
finally
tim
cook
be
able
to
shake
him
out
of
his
lethargy
he
quote
someone
as
say
that
apple
be
become
the
new
microsoft
complacent
and
arrogant
the
next
day
job
change
his
attitude
let
s
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
he
say
when
the
data
about
drop
call
be
assemble
from
at
t
job
realize
there
be
a
problem
even
if
it
be
more
minor
than
people
be
make
it
seem
so
he
flew
back
from
hawaii
but
before
he
left
he
make
some
phone
call
it
be
time
to
gather
a
couple
of
trust
old
hand
wise
men
who
have
be

he
told
him

little
misty
eyed
when

the
experience

through
that
all
again
just
for
that
opportunity
to
have
him
see
me
at
work

katie
cotton
the
steady
public

chief
at
apple
and
seven
other
top
executive
the
meeting
last
all
afternoon
it
be
one
of
the
great
meeting
of
my
life
job
later
say
he
begin
by
lay
out
all
the
data
they
have
gather
here
be
the
fact
so
what
should
we
do
about
it
mckenna
be
the
most
calm
and
straightforward
just
lay
out
the
truth
the
data
he
say
don
t
appear
arrogant
but
appear
firm
and
confident
others
include
vincent
push
job
to
be
more
apologetic
but
mckenna
say
no
don
t
go
into
the
press
conference
with
your
tail
between
your
leg
he
advise
you
should
just
say
phone
aren
t
perfect
and
we
re
not
perfect
we
re
human
and
do
the
best
we
can
and
here
s
the
data
that
become
the
strategy
when
the
topic
turn
to
the
perception
of
arrogance
mckenna
urge
him
not
to
worry
too
much
i
don
t
think
it
would
work
to
try
to
make
steve
look
humble
mckenna
explain
later
as
steve
say
about
himself
what
you
see
be
what
you
get
at
the
press
event
that
friday
held
in
apple
s
auditorium
job
follow
mckenna
s
advice
he
do
not
grovel
or
apologize
yet
he
be
able
to
defuse
the
problem
by
show
that
apple
understood
it
and
would
try
to
make
it
right
then
he
change
the
framework
of
the
discussion
say
that
all
cell
phone
have
some
problem
later
he
told
me
that
he
have
sound
a
bit
too
annoyed
at
the
event
but
in
fact
he
be
able
to
strike
a
tone
that
be
unemotional
and
straightforward
he
capture
it
in
four
short
declarative
sentence
we
re
not
perfect
phone
be
not
perfect
we
all
know
that
but
we
want
to
make
our
user
happy
if
anyone
be
unhappy
he
say
they
could
return
the
phone
the
return
rate
turn
out
to
be
less
than
a
third
of
the
return
rate
for
the
iphone
g
or
most
other
phone
or
get
a
free
bumper
case
from
apple
he
go
on
to
report
data
show
that
other
mobile
phone
have
similar
problem
that
be
not
totally
true
apple
s
antenna
design
make
it
slightly
bad
than
most
other
phone
include
earlier
version
of
the
iphone
but
it
be
true
that
the
medium
frenzy
over
the
iphone
s
drop
call
be
overblown
this
be
blown
so
out
of
proportion
that
it
s
incredible
he
say
instead
of
be
appalled
that
he
didn
t
grovel
or
order
a
recall
most
customer
realize
that
he
be
right
the
wait
list
for
the
phone
which
be
already
sell
out
go
from
two
week
to
three
it
remain
the
company
s
fast
sell
product
ever
the
medium
debate
shift
to
the
issue
of
whether
job
be
right
to
assert
that
other
smartphones
have
the
same
antenna
problem
even
if
the
answer
be
no
that
be
a
well
story
to
face
than
one
about
whether
the
iphone
be
a
defective
dud
some
medium
observer
be
incredulous
in
a
bravura
demonstration
of
stonewall
righteousness
and
hurt
sincerity
steve
job
successfully
take
to
the
stage
the
other
day
to
deny
the
problem
dismiss
the
criticism

and
wozniak
look
at
an
apple
circuit
board
get
the
beatles
on
itunes
be
the
culmination
of
why
we
get
into
the
music
business
say
cue
chapter
forty
to
infinity
the
cloud
the
spaceship
and
beyond
the
ipad
even
before
the
ipad
go
on
sale
job
be
think
about
what
should
be
in
the
ipad
it
need
front
and
back
camera
everyone
knew
that
be
come
and
he
definitely
want
it
to
be
thinner
but
there
be
a
peripheral
issue
that
he
focus
on
that
most
people
hadn
t
thought
about
the
case
that
people
use
cover
the
beautiful
line
of
the
ipad
and
detract
from
the
screen
they
make
fatter
what
should
be
thinner
they
put
a
pedestrian
cloak
on
a
device
that
should
be
magical
in
all
of
its
aspect
around
that
time
he
read
an
article
about
magnet
cut
it
out
and
hand
it
to
jony
ive
the
magnet
have
a
cone
of
attraction
that
could
be
precisely
focus
perhaps
they
could
be
use
to
align
a
detachable
cover
that
way
it
could
snap
onto
the
front
of
an
ipad
but
not
have
to
engulf
the
entire
device
one
of
the
guy
in
ive
s
group
work
out
how
to
make
a
detachable
cover
that
could
connect
with
a
magnetic
hinge
when
you
begin
to
open
it
the
screen
would
pop
to
life
like
the
face
of
a
tickle
baby
and
then
the
cover
could
fold
into
a
stand
it
be
not
high
tech
it
be
purely
mechanical
but
it
be
enchant
it
also
be
another
example
of
job
s
desire
for
end
to
end
integration
the
cover
and
the
ipad
have
be
design
together
so
that
the
magnet
and
hinge
all
connect
seamlessly
the
ipad
would
have
many
improvement
but
this
cheeky
little
cover
which
most
other
ceo
would
never
have
bother
with
be
the
one
that
would
elicit
the
most
smile
because
job
be
on
another
medical
leave
he
be
not
expect
to
be
at
the
launch
of
the
ipad
schedule
for
march
in
san
francisco
but
when
the
invitation
be
sent
out
he
told
me
that
i
should
try
to
be
there
it
be
the
usual
scene
top
apple
executive
in
the
front
row
tim

and
the
sound

blaring
the
appropriate
beatles
song

up
to
you

a
revolution
and
here

the
last
minute
with
two
rather
wide
eyed
freshman
dorm
mate
we
ve
be

on
this
product
for
a
while
and
i
just
didn
t
want
to
miss
today
job
say
as
he
amble
onstage
look
scarily
gaunt
but
with
a
jaunty
smile
the
crowd
erupt
in
whoop
holler
and
a
stand
ovation
he
begin
his
demo
of
the
ipad
by
show
off
the
new
cover
this
time
the
case
and
the
product
be
design
together
he
explain
then
he
move
on
to
address
a
criticism
that
have
be
rankle
him
because
it
have
some
merit
the
original
ipad
have
be
well
at
consume
content
than
at
create
it
so
apple
have
adapt
its
two
best
creative
application
for
the
macintosh
garageband
and
imovie
and
make
powerful
version
available
for
the
ipad
job
show
how
easy
it
be
to
compose
and
orchestrate
a
song
or
put
music
and
special
effect
into
your
home

and
post
or
share
such
creation
use
the
new
ipad

again

end
his
presentation
with
the
slide
show
the
intersection
of
liberal
art
street
and
technology
street
and
this
time
he
give
one
of
the
clearest
expression
of
his
credo
that
true
creativity
and
simplicity
come
from
integrate
the
whole
widget
hardware
and
software
and
for
that
matter
content
and
cover
and
salesclerk
rather
than
allow
thing
to
be
open
and
fragment
as
happen
in
the
world
of
window
pc
and
be
now
happen
with
android
device
it
s
in
apple
s
dna
that
technology
alone
be
not
enough
we
believe
that
it
s
technology
married
with
the
humanity
that
yield
us
the
result
that
make
our
heart
sing
nowhere
be
that
more
true
than
in
these
post
pc
device
folk
be
rush
into
this
tablet
market
and
they
re
look
at
it
as
the
next
pc
in
which
the
hardware
and
the
software
be
do
by
different
company
our
experience
and
every
bone
in
our
body
say
that
be
not
the
right
approach
these
be
post
pc
device
that
need
to
be
even
more
intuitive
and
easy
to
use
than
a
pc
and
where
the
software
and
the
hardware
and
the
application
need
to
be
intertwine
in
an
even
more
seamless
way
than
they
be
on
a
pc
we
think
we
have
the
right
architecture
not
just
in
silicon
but
in
our
organization
to
build
these
kind
of
product
it
be
an
architecture
that
be
breed
not
just
into
the
organization
he
have
built
but
into
his

soul

and
a
pasta
primavera
which
he
shove

after

taste
but
then
he
ate

of
my

and
order
a
full

for
the
trip
there

and
toy

more
revealingly
there
be
just
one
book
that
he
have
download
the
autobiography
of
a
yogi
the
guide
to
meditation
and
spirituality
that
he
have
first
read
as
a
teenager
then
reread
in
india
and
have
read
once
a
year
ever
since
midway
through
the
morning
he
decide
he
want
to
eat
something
he
be
still
too
weak
to
drive
so
i
drove
him
to
a

in
a
shopping
mall

be
close
but
the
owner
be
use
to

on
the
door
at
off
hour
and
he
happily
let
us
in
he
s
take
on
a
mission
to
try
to
fatten
me
up
job
joked
his
doctor
have
push
him
to
eat
egg
as
a
source
of
high
quality
protein
and
he
order
an
omelet
living
with
a
disease
like
this
and
all
the
pain
constantly
reminds
you
of
your
own
mortality
and
that
can
do
strange
thing
to
your
brain
if
you
re
not
careful
he
say
you
don
t
make
plan
more
than
a
year
out
and
that
s
bad
you
need
to
force
yourself
to
plan
as
if
you
will
live
for
many
year
an
example
of
this
magical
think
be
his
plan
to
build
a
luxurious
yacht

the
mediterranean
on
many
of
these
cruise
job
get
bore
or
begin
to
hate
the
design
of
the
boat
so
they
would
cut
the
trip
short
and
fly
to
kona
village
but
sometimes
the
cruise
work
well
the
best
vacation

me
that
for
young
people
this
whole
world
be
the
same
now
when

sad
and
i
decide
that
work
on
the
design
be
fun
to
do
and
maybe
i
have
a
shot
at
be
alive
when
it
s
do
if
i
stop
work
on

then
i
make
it
alive
for
another
two

that
and

once
icloud
in
job
have
a
vision
your
personal
computer
would
serve
as
a
digital
hub
for
a
variety
of
lifestyle
device
such
as
music
player
video
recorder
phone
and
tablet
this
played
to
apple
s
strength
of
create
end
to
end
product
that
be
simple
to
use
the
company
be
thus
transform
from
a
high
end
niche
computer
company
to
the
most
valuable
technology
company
in
the
world
by
job
have
developed
a
vision
for
the
next
wave
of
the
digital
era
in
the
future
he
believe
your
desktop
computer
would
no
longer
serve
as
the
hub
for
your
content
instead
the
hub
would
move
to
the
cloud
in
other
word
your
content
would
be
store
on
remote
server
manage
by
a
company
you
trust
and
it
would
be
available
for
you
to
use
on
any
device
anywhere
it
would
take
him
three
year
to
get
it
right
he
begin
with
a
false
step
in
the
summer
of
he
launch
a
product
call
mobileme
an
expensive
per
year
subscription
service
that
allow
you
to
store
your
address
book
document
picture
video
email
and
calendar
remotely
in
the
cloud
and
to
sync
them
with
any
device
in
theory
you
could
go
to
your
iphone
or
any
computer
and
access
all
aspect
of
your
digital
life
there
be
however
a
big
problem
the
service
to
use
job
s
terminology
suck
it
be
complex
device
didn
t
sync
well
and
email
and
other
data
get
lose
randomly
in
the
ether
apple
s
mobileme
be
far
too
flaw
to
be
reliable
be
the
headline
on
walt
mossberg
s
review
in
the
wall
street
journal
job
be
furious
he
gather
the
mobileme
team
in
the
auditorium
on
the
apple
campus
stood
onstage
and
ask
can
anyone
tell
me
what
mobileme
be
suppose
to
do
after
the
team
member
offer
their
answer
job
shot
back
so
why
the
fuck
doesn
t
it
do
that
over
the
next
half
hour
he
continued
to
berate
them
you
ve
tarnished
apple
s
reputation
he
say
you
should
hate
each
other
for
have
let
each
other
down
mossberg
our
friend
be
no
longer
write
good
thing
about
us
in
front
of
the
whole
audience
he
get
rid
of
the
leader
of
the
mobileme
team
and
replace
him
with
eddy
cue
who
oversaw
all
internet
content
at
apple
as
fortune
s
adam
lashinsky
report
in
a
dissection
of
the
apple
corporate
culture
accountability
be
strictly
enforce
by
it
be
clear
that
google
amazon
microsoft
and
others
be
aim
to
be
the
company
that
could
best
store
all
of
your
content
and
data
in
the
cloud
and
sync
it
on
your
various
device
so
job
redouble
his
effort
as
he
explain
it
to
me
that
fall
we
need
to
be
the
company
that
manages
your
relationship
with
the
cloud
stream
your
music
and
video
from
the
cloud
store
your
picture
and
information
and
maybe
even
your
medical
data
apple
be
the
first
to
have
the
insight
about
your
computer
become
a
digital
hub
so
we
write
all
of
these
apps
iphoto
imovie
itunes
and
tie
in
our
device
like
the
ipod
and
iphone
and
ipad
and
it
s
work
brilliantly
but
over
the
next
few
year
the
hub
be
go
to
move
from
your
computer
into
the
cloud
so
it
s
the
same
digital
hub
strategy
but
the
hub
s
in
a
different
place
it
mean
you
will
always
have
access
to
your
content
and
you
won
t
have
to
sync
it
s
important
that
we
make
this
transformation
because
of
what
clayton
christensen
call
the
innovator
s
dilemma
where
people
who
invent
something
be
usually
the
last
one
to
see
past
it
and
we
certainly
don
t
want
to
be
left
behind
i
m
go
to
take
mobileme
and
make
it
free
and
we
re
go
to
make
sync
content
simple
we
be
building
a
server
farm
in
north
carolina
we
can
provide
all
the
sync
you
need
and
that
way
we
can
lock
in
the
customer
job
discuss
this
vision
at
his
monday
morning
meeting
and
gradually
it
be
refine
to
a
new
strategy
i
sent
email
to
group
of
people
at
a
m
and
bat
thing
around
he
recall
we
think
about
this
a
lot
because
it
s
not
a
job
it
s
our
life
although
some
board
member
include
al
gore
question
the
idea
of
make
mobileme
free
they
support
it
it
would
be
their
strategy
for
attract
customer
into
apple
s
orbit
for
the
next
decade
the
new
service
be
name
icloud
and
job
unveiled
it
in
his
keynote
address
to
apple
s
worldwide
developer
conference
in
june
he
be
still
on
medical
leave
and
for
some
day
in
may
have
be
hospitalize
with
infection
and
pain
some
close
friend
urge
him
not
to
make
the
presentation
which
would
involve
lot
of
preparation
and
rehearsal
but
the
prospect
of
usher
in
another
tectonic
shift
in
the
digital
age
seem
to
energize
him
when
he
come
onstage
at
the
san
francisco
convention
center
he
be
wear
a
vonrosen
black
cashmere
sweater
on
top
of
his
usual
issey
miyake
black
turtleneck
and
he
have
thermal
underwear
beneath
his
blue
jean
but
he
look
more
gaunt
than
ever
the
crowd
give
him
a
prolong
stand
ovation
that
always
help
and
i
appreciate
it
he
say
but
within
minute
apple
s
stock
drop
more
than
to
he
be
make
a
heroic
effort
but
he
look
weak
he
hand
the
stage
over
to
phil
schiller
and
scott
forstall
to
demo
the
new
operating
system
for
mac
and
mobile
device
then
come
back
on
to
show
off
icloud
himself
about
ten
year
ago
we
have
one
of
our
most
important
insight
he
say
the
pc
be
go
to
become
the
hub
for
your
digital
life
your
video
your
photo
your
music
but
it
have
broken
down
in
the
last
few
year
why
he
riffed
about
how
hard
it
be
to
get
all
of
your
content
sync
to
each
of
your
device
if
you
have
a
song
you
ve
download
on
your
ipad
a
picture
you
ve
take
on
your
iphone
and
a
video
you
ve
store
on
your
computer
you
can
end
up
feel
like
an
old
fashion
switchboard
operator
as
you
plug
usb
cable
into
and
out
of
thing
to
get
the
content
share
keep
these
device
in
sync
be
drive
us
crazy
he
say
to
great
laughter
we
have
a
solution
it
s
our
next
big
insight
we
be
go
to
demote
the
pc
and
the
mac
to
be
just
a
device
and
we
be
go
to
move
the
digital
hub
into
the
cloud
job
be
well
aware
that
this
big
insight
be
in
fact
not
really
new
indeed
he
joked
about
apple
s
previous
attempt
you
may
think
why
should
i
believe
them
they
re
the
one
who
brought
me
mobileme
the
audience
laugh
nervously
let
me
just
say
it
wasn
t
our
fine
hour
but
as
he
demonstrate
icloud
it
be
clear
that
it
would
be
well
mail
contact
and
calendar
entry
sync
instantly
so
do
apps
photo
book
and
document
most
impressively
job
and
eddy
cue
have
make
deal
with
the
music
company
unlike
the
folk
at
google
and
amazon
apple
would
have
eighteen
million
song
on
its
cloud
server
if
you
have
any
of
these
on
any
of
your
device
or
computer
whether
you
have
bought
it
legally
or

both
offer

neither

a
variety
of

and
stayed
within

which
have
do

engineer
building
such
as
the

in
london
not
surprisingly
job
get
so
involve
in
the
planning
both
the
vision
and
the
detail
that
it
become
almost
impossible
to
settle
on
a
final
design
this
be
to
be
his
last
edifice
and
he
want
to
get
it
right
foster
s
firm
assign
fifty
architect
to
the
team
and
every
three
week
throughout
they
show
job
revise
model
and
option
over
and
over
he
would
come
up
with
new
concept
sometimes
entirely
new
shape
and
make
them
restart
and
provide
more
alternative
when
he
first
show
me
the
model
and
plan
in
his
living
room
the
building
be
shape
like
a
huge
wind
racetrack
make
of
three
join
semicircle
around
a
large
central
courtyard
the
wall
be
floor
to
ceiling
glass
and
the
interior
have
row
of
office
pod
that
allow
the
sunlight
to
stream
down
the
aisle
it
permit
serendipitous
and
fluid
meeting
space
he
say
and
everybody
get
to
participate
in
the
sunlight
the
next
time
he
show
me
the
plan
a
month
later
we
be
in
apple
s
large
conference
room
across
from
his
office
where
a
model
of
the
propose
building
cover
the
table
he
have
make
a
major
change
the
pod
would
all
be
set
back
from
the
window
so
that
long
corridor
would
be
bath
in
sun
these
would
also
serve
as
the
common
space
there
be
a
debate
with
some
of
the
architect
who
want
to
allow
the
window
to
be
open
job
have
never
like
the
idea
of
people
be
able
to
open
thing
that
would
just
allow
people
to
screw
thing
up
he
declare
on
that
as
on
other
detail
he
prevail
when
he
get
home
that
even
job
show
off
the
drawing
at
dinner
and
reed
joked
that
the
aerial
view
remind
him
of
male
genitalia
his
father
dismiss
the
comment
as
reflect
the
mind
set
of
a
teenager
but
the
next
day
he
mention
the
comment
to
the
architect
unfortunately
once
i
ve
told
you
that
you
re
never
go
to
be
able
to
erase
that
image
from
your
mind
he
say
by
the
next
time
i
visit
the
shape
have
be
change
to
a
simple
circle
the
new
design
meant
that
there
would
not
be
a
straight
piece
of
glass
in
the
building
all
would
be
curve
and
seamlessly
join
job
have
long
be
fascinate
with
glass
and
his
experience
demand
huge
custom
pane
for
apple
s
retail
store
make
him
confident
that
it
would
be
possible
to
make
massive
curve
piece
in
quantity
the
plan
center
courtyard
be
eight
hundred
foot
across
more
than
three
typical
city
block
or
almost
the
length
of
three
football
field
and
he
show
it
to
me
with
overlay
indicate
how
it
could
surround
st
peter
s
square
in

one
of
his
linger
memory
be
of
the
orchard
that
have
once
dominate
the
area
so
he
hire
a
senior
arborist
from
stanford
and
decreed
that
of
the
property
would
be
landscape
in
a
natural
manner
with
six
thousand
tree
i

with
a
know
and
slightly
rebellious
smile
intense
eye
and
a
shock
of
dark
hair
but
from

very
good
doctor
job

his
enthusiasm
for
it
be
exactly
how
i
felt
about
computer
when

i
think
the
big
innovation
of

twenty
first

be
the
intersection
of
biology
and
technology

reed
use
his
cancer
study
as
the
basis
for
the

his
father
sat
in
the
audience
beam
along
with
the
rest
of
his
family

fantasize
about
reed
get
a
house
here
in
palo
alto
with
his
family
and
rid
his
bike
to
work
as
a
doctor
at
stanford
job
say
afterward

attractive
young

mature
than
her
father
s
she
thought
that
she
might
want

sense
of

that
obama
be
really
psyched
to
meet
with
you
job
reply
that
if
that
be
the
case
then
obama

actually
last
forty
five
minute
and
job
do
not
hold

you
re
head
for
a
one
term
presidency
job
told
obama
at
the
outset
to
prevent
that
he
say
the
administration
need
to
be
a
lot
more
business
friendly
he
described
how
easy
it
be
to
build
a
factory
in
china
and
say
that
it
be
almost
impossible
to
do
so
these
day
in
america
largely
because
of
regulation
and
unnecessary
cost
job
also
attack
america
s
education
system
say
that
it
be
hopelessly
antiquate
and
cripple
by
union
work
rule
until
the

union
be
broken
there
be
almost
no
hope
for

reform
teacher
should
be
treat
as
professional
he
say
not
as
industrial
assembly
line
worker
principal
should
be
able
to
hire

fire
them
base
on
how
good
they
be
school
should
be
stay
open
until
at
least
p
m
and
be
in
session
eleven
month
of
the
year
it
be
absurd
he
add
that
american
classroom
be
still
base
on
teacher
stand
at
a
board
and
use
textbook
all
book
learn

despite
that
the

initially
become
a
litany
of
suggestion
of
what
the

do
for
the
business
there
chamber
for
example
push

during

the

and
so
be
zuckerberg
who
turn
to
valerie
jarrett
sit
to
his
right
and
whisper
we
should
be
talk
about
what

he
just
talk
about
what
s
good
for
him
doerr
be
able
to
refocus
the
discussion
by
call
on
everyone
to
suggest
a
list
of
action
item
when
job
s
turn
come
he
stress
the
need
for
more
train
engineer
and
suggest
that
any
foreign
student
who
earn
an
engineering
degree
in
the
united
state
should
be
give
a
visa
to
stay
in
the
country
obama
say
that
could
be
do
only
in
the
context
of
the
dream
act
which
would
allow
illegal
alien
who
arrive
as
minor
and
finish
high
school
to
become
legal
resident
something
that
the
republican
have
block
job
found
this
an
annoy
example
of
how
politics
can
lead
to
paralysis
the
president
be
very
smart
but
he
kept
explain
to
us
reason
why
thing
can
t
get
do
he
recall
it
infuriates
me
job
go
on
to
urge
that
a
way
be
found
to
train
more
american
engineer
apple
have
factory
worker
employ
in
china
he
say
and
that
be
because
it
need
engineer
on
site
to
support
those
worker
you
can
t
find
that
many
in
america
to
hire
he
say
these
factory
engineer
do
not
have
to
be
phd
or
genius
they
simply
need
to
have
basic
engineering
skill
for
manufacturing
tech
school
community
college
or
trade
school
could
train
them
if
you
could
educate
these
engineer
he
say
we
could
move
more
manufacturing
plant
here
the
argument
make
a
strong
impression
on
the
president
two
or
three
time
over
the
next
month
he
told
his
aide
we
ve
get
to
find
way
to
train
those
manufacturing
engineer
that
job
told
us
about
job
be
pleased
that
obama
follow
up
and
they
talk
by
telephone
a
few
time
after
the
meeting
he
offer
to
help
create
obama
s
political
ad
for
the
campaign
he
have
make
the
same
offer
in
but
he
d
become
annoyed
when
obama
s
strategist
david
axelrod
wasn
t
totally
deferential
i
think
political
advertising
be
terrible
i
d
love
to
get
lee
clow
out
of
retirement
and
we
can
come
up
with
great
commercial
for
him
job
told
me
a
few
week
after
the
dinner
job
have
be
fight
pain
all
week
but
the
talk
of
politics
energize
him
every
once
in
a
while
a
real
ad
pro
get
involve
the
way
hal
riney
do
with
it
s
morning
in
america
for
reagan
s
reelection
in
so
that
s
what
i
d
like
to
do
for
obama
third
medical
leave
the
cancer
always
sent
signal
as
it
reappear
job
have
learn
that
he
would
lose
his
appetite
and
begin
to
feel
pain
throughout
his
body
his
doctor
would
do
test
detect
nothing
and
reassure
him
that
he
still
seem
clear
but
he
knew
well
the
cancer
have
its
signal
pathway
and
a
few
month
after
he
felt
the
sign
the
doctor
would
discover
that
it
be
indeed
no
longer
in
remission
another
such
downturn
begin
in
early
november
he
be

stop
eat
and
have
to
be
fed
intravenously
by
a
nurse
who
come
to
the
house
the
doctor
found
no
sign
of
more
tumor
and
they
assume
that
this
be
just
another
of
his
periodic
cycle
of
fight
infection
and
digestive
malady
he
have
never
be
one
to
suffer
pain
stoically
so
his
doctor
and
family
have
become
somewhat
inure
to
his
complaint
he
and
his
family
go
to
kona

for
thanksgiving
but
his
eat
do
not
improve
the
din

look
emaciate
rock
and
moan
at
meal

it
be
a
testament
to
the
resort
and
its
guest
that
his
condition
never
leak
out
when
he
return

increasingly
emotional
and
morose
he
thought
he
be
go
to
die
he
told
his
kid
and
he
would
get
choked
up
about
the
possibility
that

powell
realize
be
that
the
rumor
be
true
and
they
be
not
go
to
go
away
job
have
agree
only
reluctantly
to
go
on
medical
leave
two
year
earlier
when
his

be
fail
and
this

he
also
resist
the

it
would
be
like
leave

unsure
that

finally
bow
to
the
inevitable
in
january
the

expect
it
the

he
told
them
that
he
want
another
leave
take
only
three
minute
he
have
often
discuss
with
the

in

his

about
who

if
anything

to
him
present
both
short
term
and
longer
term
combination
of
option
but
there
be
no
doubt
that
in
this
current
situation
tim
cook
would
again
take
charge
of
day
to

operation
the
follow
saturday
afternoon
job
allow
his
wife
to
convene
a
meeting
of
his
doctor
he
realize
that
he
be
face
the
type
of
problem
that
he
never
permit
at
apple
his
treatment
be
fragment
rather
than
integrate
each
of
his
myriad
malady
be
be
treat
by
different
specialist
oncologist
pain
specialist
nutritionist
hepatologists
and
hematologist
but
they
be
not
be
co
ordinate
in
a
cohesive
approach
the
way
james
eason
have
do
in
memphis
one
of
the
big
issue
in
the
health
care
industry
be
the
lack
of
caseworker
or
advocate
that
be
the
quarterback
of
each
team
powell
say
this
be
particularly
true
at
stanford
where
nobody
seem
in
charge
of
figure
out
how
nutrition
be
related
to
pain
care
and
to
oncology
so
powell
ask
the
various
stanford
specialist
to
come
to
their
house
for
a
meeting
that
also
include
some
outside
doctor
with
a
more
aggressive
and
integrate
approach
such
as
david
agus
of
usc
they
agree
on
a
new
regimen
for
deal
with
the
pain
and
for
coordinate
the
other
treatment
thanks
to
some
pioneer
science
the
team
of
doctor
have
be
able
to
keep
job
one
step
ahead
of
the
cancer
he
have
become
one
of
the
first
twenty
people
in
the
world
to
have
all
of
the
gene
of
his
cancer
tumor
as
well
as
of
his
normal
dna
sequence
it
be
a
process
that
at
the
time
cost
more
than
the
gene
sequence
and
analysis
be
do
collaboratively
by
team
at
stanford
john
hopkins
and
the
broad
institute
of
mit
and
harvard
by
know
the
unique
genetic
and
molecular
signature
of
job
s
tumor
his
doctor
have
be
able
to
pick
specific
drug
that
directly
target
the
defective
molecular
pathway
that
cause
his
cancer
cell
to
grow
in
an
abnormal
manner
this
approach
know
as
molecular
target
therapy
be
more
effective
than
traditional
chemotherapy
which
attack
the
process
of
division
of
all
the
body
s
cell
cancerous
or
not
this
target
therapy
be
not
a
silver
bullet
but
at
time
it
seem
close
to
one
it
allow
his
doctor
to
look
at
a
large
number
of
drug
common
and
uncommon
already
available
or
only
in
development
to
see
which
three
or
four
might
work
best
whenever
his
cancer
mutate
and
repaved
around
one
of
these
drug
the
doctor
have
another
drug
line
up
to
go
next
although
powell
be
diligent
in
oversee
her
husband
s
care
he
be
the
one
who
make
the
final
decision
on
each
new
treatment
regimen
a
typical
example
occur
in
may
when
he
held
a
meeting
with
george
fisher
and
other
doctor
from
stanford
the
gene
sequence
analyst
from
the
broad
institute
and
his
outside
consultant
david
agus
they
all
gather
around
a
table
at
a
suite
in
the
four
season
hotel
in
palo
alto
powell
do
not
come
but
their
son
reed
do
for
three
hour
there
be
presentation
from
the
stanford
and
broad
researcher
on
the
new
information
they
have
learn
about
the
genetic
signature
of
his
cancer
job
be
his
usual
feisty
self
at
one
point
he
stop
a
broad
institute
analyst
who
have
make
the
mistake
of
use
powerpoint
slide
job
chide
him
and
explain
why
apple
s
keynote
presentation
software
be
well
he
even
offer
to
teach
him
how
to
use
it
by
the
end
of
the
meeting
job
and
his
team
have
go
through
all
of
the
molecular
data
assess
the
rationale
for
each
of
the
potential
therapy
and
come
up
with
a
list
of
test
to
help
them
well
prioritize
these
one
of
his
doctor
told
him
that
there
be
hope
that
his
cancer
and
others
like
it
would
soon
be
consider
a
manageable
chronic
disease
which

product
and
durable
company
job
recall
we
talk
a
lot
about
focus
and
choose
people
how
to
know
who
to
trust
and
how
to
build
a
team
of
lieutenant
he
can
count
on
i
described
the
block
and
tackle
he
would
have

great
i
try
to
be
as
helpful
as
i
could
i
will
continue
to
do
that
with
people
like
mark
zuckerberg
too
that
s
how
i
m
go
to
spend
part
of
the
time
i
have
left
i
can
help
the
next
generation
remember
the
lineage
of
great
company
here
and
how
to
continue
the
tradition
the
valley
have
be
very
supportive
of
me
i
should
do
my
best
to
repay
the
announcement
of
job
s
medical
leave
prompt
others
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
house
in
palo
alto
bill
clinton
for
example
come
by
and
talk
about
everything
from
the
middle
east
to
american
politics
but
the
most
poignant
visit
be
from
the
other
tech
prodigy
born
in
the
guy
who
for
more
than
three
decade
have
be
job
s
rival
and
partner
in
define
the
age
of
personal
computer
bill
gate
have
never
lose
his
fascination
with
job
in
the
spring
of
i
be
at
a
dinner
with
him
in
washington
where
he
have
come
to
discus
his
foundation
s
global
health
endeavor
he
express
amazement
at
the
success
of
the
ipad
and
how
job
even
while
sick
be
focus
on
way
to
improve
it
here
i
be
merely
save
the
world
from
malaria
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
steve
be
still
come
up
with
amaze
new
product
he
say
wistfully
maybe
i
should
have
stayed
in
that
game
he
smile
to
make
sure
that
i
knew
he
be
joking
or
at
least
half
joking
through
their
mutual
friend
mike
slade
gate
make
arrangement
to
visit
job
in
may
the
day
before
it
be
suppose
to
happen
job
s
assistant
call
to
say
he
wasn
t
feel
well
enough
but
it
be
reschedule
and
early
one
afternoon
gate
drove
to
job
s
house
walk
through
the
back
gate
to
the
open
kitchen
door
and
saw
eve
study
at
the
table
be
steve
around
he
ask
eve
point
him
to
the
living
room
they
spent
more
than
three
hour
together
just
the
two
of
them
reminisce
we
be
like
the
old
guy
in
the
industry
look
back
job
recall
he
be
happier
than
i
ve
ever
see
him
and
i
kept
think
how
healthy
he
look
gate
be
similarly
struck
by
how
job
though
scarily
gaunt
have
more
energy
than
he
expect
he
be
open
about
his
health
problem
and
at
least
that
day
feel
optimistic
his
sequential
regimen
of
target
drug
treatment
he
told
gate
be
like
jumping
from
one
lily
pad
to
another
try
to
stay
a
step
ahead
of
the
cancer
job
ask
some
question
about
education
and
gate
sketch
out
his
vision
of
what
school
in
the
future
would
be
like
with
student
watch
lecture
and
video
lesson
on
their
own
while
use
the
classroom
time
for
discussion
and
problem
solve
they
agree
that
computer
have
so
far
make
surprisingly
little
impact
on
school
far
less
than
on
other
realm
of
society
such
as
medium
and
medicine
and
law
for
that
to
change
gate
say
computer
and
mobile
device
would
have
to
focus
on
deliver
more
personalize
lesson
and
provide
motivational
feedback
they
also
talk
a
lot
about
the
joy
of
family
include
how
lucky
they
be
to
have
good
kid
and
be
married
to
the
right
woman
we
laugh
about
how
fortunate
it
be
that
he
met
laurene
and
she
s
kept
him
semi
sane
and
i
met
melinda
and
she
s
kept
me
semi
sane
gate
recall
we
also
discuss
how
it
s
challenge
to
be
one
of
our
child
and
how
do
we
mitigate
that
it
be
pretty
personal
at
one
point
eve
who
in
the
past
have
be
in
horse
show
with
gate
s
daughter
jennifer
wander
in
from
the
kitchen
and
gate
ask
her
what
jumping
routine
she
like
best
as
their
hour
together
drew
to
a
close
gate
compliment
job
on
the
incredible
stuff
he
have
create
and
for
be
able
to
save
apple
in
the
late
s
from
the
bozo
who
be
about
to
destroy
it
he
even
make
an
interest
concession
throughout
their
career
they
have
adhere
to
compete
philosophy
on
one
of
the
most
fundamental
of
all
digital
issue
whether
hardware
and
software
should
be
tightly
integrate
or
more
open
i
use
to
believe
that
the
open
horizontal
model
would
prevail
gate
told
him
but
you
prove
that
the
integrate
vertical
model
could
also
be
great
job
respond
with
his
own
admission
your
model
work
too
he
say
they
be
both
right
each
model
have
work
in
the
realm
of
personal
computer
where
macintosh
coexist
with
a
variety
of
window
machine
and
that
be
likely
to
be
true
in
the
realm
of
mobile
device
as
well
but
after
recount
their
discussion
gate
add
a
caveat
the
integrate
approach
work
well
when
steve
be
at
the
helm
but
it
doesn
t
mean
it
will
win
many
round
in
the
future
job
similarly
felt
compel
to
add
a
caveat
about
gate
after
describe
their
meeting
of
course
his
fragment
model
work
but
it
didn
t
make
really
great
product
it
produce
crappy
product
that
be
the
problem
the
big
problem
at
least
over
time
that
day
have
come
job
have
many
other
idea
and
project
that
he
hop
to
develop
he
want
to
disrupt
the
textbook
industry
and
save
the
spine
of
spavined
student
bearing
backpack
by
create
electronic
text
and
curriculum
material
for
the
ipad
he
be
also
work
with
bill
atkinson
his
friend
from
the
original
macintosh
team
on
devise
new
digital
technology
that
work
at
the
pixel
level
to
allow
people
to
take
great
photograph
use
their
iphones
even
in
situation
without
much
light
and
he
very
much
want
to
do
for
television
set
what
he
have
do
for
computer
music
player
and
phone
make
them
simple
and
elegant
i
d
like
to
create
an
integrate
television
set
that
be
completely
easy
to
use
he
told
me
it
would
be
seamlessly
sync
with
all
of
your
device
and
with
icloud
no
longer
would
user
have
to
fiddle
with
complex
remote
for
dvd
player
and
cable
channel
it
will
have
the
simplest
user
interface
you
could
imagine
i
finally
crack
it
but
by
july
his
cancer
have
spread
to
his
bone
and
other
part
of
his
body
and
his
doctor

find
target
drug
that
could
beat
it

to
work
he
and
powell
have
reserve
a
sailboat
for
a
family
cruise

of
that
month
but
those
plan
be
scuttle
he
be

almost
no
solid
food
and
he
spent
most
of
his
day
in
his
bedroom
watch
television
in
august
i
get
a
message
that
he
want
me

visit
when
i
arrive
at
his
house
at
mid
morning
on
a
saturday
he
be
still
asleep
so
i
sat
with
his
wife
and
kid
in
the
garden
fill
with
a
profusion
of
yellow
rose
and
various
type
of
daisy
until
he
sent
word
that
i
should
come
in
i
found
him
curl
up
on
the
bed
wear
khaki
short
and
a
white
turtleneck
his
leg
be
shockingly
sticklike
but
his
smile
be
easy
and
his
mind
quick
we
well
hurry
because
i
have
very
little
energy
he
say
he
want
to
show
me
some
of
his
personal
picture
and
let
me
pick
a
few
to
use
in
the
book
because
he
be
too
weak
to
get
out
of
bed
he
point
to
various
drawer
in
the
room
and
i
carefully
brought
him
the
photograph
in
each
as
i
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
i
held
them
up
one
at
a
time
so
he
could
see
them
some
prompt
story
others
merely
elicit
a
grunt
or
a
smile
i
have
never
see
a
picture
of
his
father
paul
job
and
i
be
startle
when
i
come
across
a
snapshot
of
a
handsome
hardscrabble
s
dad
hold
a
toddler
yes
that
s
him
he
say
you
can
use
it
he
then
point
to
a
box
near
the
window
that
contain
a
picture
of
his
father
look
at
him
lovingly
at
his
wedding
he
be
a
great
man
job
say
quietly
i
murmur
something
along
the
line
of
he
would
have
be
proud
of
you
job
correct
me
he
be
proud
of
me
for
a
while
the
picture
seem
to
energize
him
we
discuss
what
various
people
from
his
past
range
from
tina
redse
to
mike
markkula
to
bill
gate
now
thought
of
him
i
recount
what
gate
have
say
after
he
described
his
last
visit
with
job
which
be
that
apple
have
show
that
the
integrate
approach
could
work
but
only
when
steve
be
at
the
helm
job
thought
that
be
silly
anyone
could
make
well
product
that
way
not
just
me
he
say
so
i
ask
him
to
name
another
company
that
make
great
product
by
insist
on
end
to
end
integration
he
thought
for
a
while
try
to
come
up
with
an
example
the
car
company
he
finally
say
but
then
he
add
or
at
least
they
use
to
when
our
discussion
turn
to
the
sorry
state
of
the
economy
and
politics
he
offer
a
few
sharp
opinion
about
the
lack
of
strong
leadership
around
the
world
i
m
disappointed
in
obama
he
say
he
s
have
trouble
lead
because
he
s
reluctant
to
offend
people
or
piss
them
off
he
caught
what
i
be
think
and
assent
with
a
little
smile
yes
that
s
not
a
problem
i
ever
have
after
two
hour
he
grow
quiet
so
i
get
off
the
bed
and
start
to
leave
wait
he
say
as
he
wave
to
me
to
sit
back
down
it
take
a
minute
or
two
for
him
to
regain
enough
energy
to
talk
i
have
a
lot
of
trepidation
about
this
project
he
finally
say
refer
to
his
decision
to
cooperate
with
this
book
i
be
really
worried
why
do
you
do
it
i
ask
i
want
my
kid
to
know
me
he
say
i
wasn
t
always
there
for
them
and
i
want
them
to
know
why
and
to
understand
what
i
do
also
when
i
get
sick
i
realize
other
people
would
write
about
me
if
i
die
and
they
wouldn
t
know
anything
they
d
get
it
all
wrong
so
i
want
to
make
sure
someone
heard
what
i
have
to
say
he
have
never
in
two
year
ask
anything
about
what
i
be
put
in
the
book
or
what
conclusion
i
have
drawn
but
now
he
look
at
me
and
say
i
know
there
will
be
a
lot
in
your
book
i
won
t
like
it
be
more
a
question
than
a
statement
and
when
he
star
at
me
for
a
response
i
nod
smile
and
say
i
be
sure
that
would
be
true
that
s
good
he
say
then
it
won
t
seem
like
an
in
house
book
i
won
t
read
it
for
a
while
because
i
don
t
want
to
get
mad
maybe
i
will
read
it
in
a
year
if
i
m
still
around
by
then
his
eye
be
close
and
his
energy
go
so
i
quietly
take
my
leave
as
his
health
deteriorate
throughout
the
summer
job
slowly
begin
to
face
the
inevitable
he
would
not
be
return
to
apple
as
ceo
so
it
be
time
for
him
to
resign
he
wrestle
with
the
decision
for
week
discuss
it
with
his
wife
bill
campbell
jony
ive
and
george
riley
one
of
the
thing
i
want
to
do
for
apple
be
to
set
an
example
of
how
you
do
a
transfer
of
power
right
he
told
me
he
joked
about
all
the
rough
transition
that
have
occur
at
the
company
over
the
past
thirty
five
year
it
s
always
be
a
drama
like
a
third
world
country
part
of
my
goal
have
be
to
make
apple
the
world
s
best
company
and
have
an
orderly
transition
be
key
to
that
the
best
time
and
place
to
make
the
transition
he
decide
be
at
the
company
s
regularly
schedule
august
board
meeting
he
be
eager
to
do
it
in
person
rather
than
merely
send
in
a
letter
or
attend
by
phone
so
he
have
be
push
himself
to
eat
and
regain
strength
the
day
before
the
meeting
he
decide
he
could
make
it
but
he
need
the
help
of
a
wheelchair
arrangement
be
make
to
have
him
driven
to
headquarters
and
wheel
to
the
boardroom
as
secretly
as
possible
he
arrive
just
before
a
m
when
the
board
member
be
finish
committee
report
and
other
routine
business
most
knew
what
be
about
to
happen
but
instead
of
go
right
to
the
topic
on
everyone
s
mind
tim
cook
and
peter
oppenheimer
the
chief
financial
officer
go
through
the
result
for
the
quarter
and
the
projection
for
the
year
ahead
then
job
say
quietly
that
he
have
something
personal
to
say
cook
ask
if
he
and
the
other
top
manager
should
leave
and
job
pause
for
more
than
thirty
second
before

of
some
product
that
apple
have
in
the
pipeline
job
pepper
them
with
question
and
thought
especially
about
what
capacity
the
fourth
generation
cellular
network
might
have
and
what
feature
need
to

grabbed
the

in
the

a
moment

when
the
talk
turn
to
tablet
compute
some
express
a
sense
of
triumph
that

suddenly
give
up
the
field
unable
to
compete
with
the
ipad
but
job
turn
somber
and
declare
that
it
be
actually
a
sad
moment
hewlett
and
packard

a
great
company
and
they
thought
they
have
left
it
in

hand
he
say
but
now

this

the

down

the

the

job
become
a

of
the

the

this
lead

to

that
the

not
be

microsoft
pursue

allow

that

not
produce

it

there
prove

to

even
with

apple
be

other

maker
be
commoditized
in
for
example
apple
have
just
of
the

in
the
personal

it
grabbed

more
significantly
in
the
early

job
s
insistence
on

give
apple
an
advantage

develop

it
you
have
to
use
apple

itunes

the
result
be
that
the

the

that
follow
be
an
elegant
delight
in

not
offer
a

the

work
in
may
apple

may
apple
surpass
microsoft

by

it

more

the
first
quarter
of
the
market
for
window
pc
shrank
by
while
the

grow
by
then
the
battle
have
begin
anew
in
the
world
of
mobile
device
google
take
the
more
open
approach
and
it
make
its
android
operating

available
for
use
by
any
maker
of
tablet
or
cell
phone
by
its
share
of
the
mobile
market
match
apple
s
the
drawback
of
android
s
openness
be
the
fragmentation
that
result
various
handset
and
tablet
maker
modify
android
into
dozen
of
variant
and
flavor
make
it
hard
for

to
remain
consistent
or
make
full
use
if
its
feature
there
be
merit
to
both
approach
some
people
want
the
freedom
to
use
more
open
system
and
have
more
choice
of
hardware
others
clearly
prefer
apple
s
tight
integration
and
control
which
lead
to
product
that
have
simpler

longer

life
great
user
friendliness
and
easy
handle

the
downside
of

approach

that
his

to
delight
the

lead

to

to

this
approach
sometimes
go
against

in

it

to
be
in
the
hand
of
a
control
freak
job
s
intensity
be
also
evident
in
his
ability
to

he
would
set

aim
his
laser
attention
on
them
and
filter
out
distraction
if
something
engage

a

annoyance
a

issue
his
cancer
diagnosis
a

he
would
resolutely
ignore
it
that

allow
him
to

no
he
get
apple
back
on

he
make

simpler
by

simpler
by

he
attribute
his
ability
to
focus
and
his
love
of
simplicity
to
his
zen
training
it
hone
his
appreciation

show
him
how
to
filter
out
anything
that
be
distract

unnecessary
and
nurture
in
him
an

unfortunately
his
zen
training
never
quite
produce
in
him
a
zen
like
calm

inner
serenity
and
that
too
be

most

my

when
something
suck
rather

it
he

andy

once
told
me
the

question
i
d
truly
love
steve
to
answer
be
why
be
you
sometimes
so
mean
even
his
family
member
wonder
whether
he
simply
lack
the
filter
that
restrains
people
from
vent
their
wound
thought
or
willfully
bypass
it
job
claimed
it
be
the
former
this
be
who
i
be
and
you
can
t
expect
me
to
be
someone
i
m
not
he
reply
when
i
ask
him
the
question
but
i
think
he
actually
could
have
control
himself
if
he
have
want
when
he
hurt
people
it
be
not
because
he
be
lack
in
emotional
awareness
quite
the
contrary
he
could
size
people
up
understand
their
inner
thought
and
know
how
to
relate
to
them
cajole
them
or
hurt
them
at
will
the
nasty
edge
to
his
personality
be
not
necessary
it
hinder
him
more
than
it
help
him

it
do
at
time
serve
a
purpose
polite

the
mathematician

call
a
magician
genius
someone
whose
insight
come
out

could
absorb

sniff

wind
and
sense

steve
job
thus
become
the
great
business
executive
of
our
era
the
one
most
certain
to
be
remember
a
century
from
now
history
will
place
him
in
the
pantheon
right
next
to
edison
and
ford
more
than
anyone
else
of
his
time
he
make
product
that
be
completely
innovative
combine
the
power
of
poetry
and
processor
with
a
ferocity
that
could
make
work
with
him
as
unsettle
as
it
be
inspire
he
also
built
the
world
s
most
creative
company
and
he
be
able
to
infuse
into
its
dna
the
design
sensibility
perfectionism
and
imagination
that
make
it
likely
to
be
even
decade
from
now
the
company
that
thrives
best
at
the
intersection
of
artistry
and
technology
and
one
more
thing
biographer
be
suppose
to
have
the
last
word
but
this
be
a
biography
of
steve
job
even
though
he
do
not
impose
his
legendary
desire
for
control
on
this
project
i
suspect
that
i
would
not
be
convey
the
right
feel
for
him
the
way
he
assert
himself
in
any
situation
if
i
just
shuffle
him
onto
history
s
stage
without
let
him
have
some
last
word
over
the
course
of
our
conversation
there
be
many
time
when
he
reflect
on
what
he
hop
his
legacy
would
be
here
be
those
thought
in
his
own
word
my
passion
have
be
to
build
an
endure
company
where
people
be
motivate
to
make
great
product
everything
else
be
secondary
sure
it
be
great
to
make
a
profit
because
that
be
what
allow
you
to
make
great
product
but
the
product
not
the
profit
be
the
motivation
sculley
flip
these
priority
to
where
the
goal
be
to
make
money
it
s
a
subtle
difference
but
it
end
up
meaning
everything
the
people
you
hire
who
get
promote
what
you
discus
in
meeting
some
people
say
give
the
customer
what
they
want
but
that
s
not
my
approach
our
job
be
to
figure
out
what
they
re
go
to
want
before
they
do
i
think
henry
ford
once
say
if
i
d
ask
customer
what
they
want
they
would
have
told
me
a
faster
horse
people
don
t
know
what
they
want
until
you
show
it
to
them
that
s
why
i
never
rely
on
market
research
our
task
be
to
read
thing
that
be
not
yet
on
the
page
edwin
land
of
polaroid
talk
about
the
intersection
of
the
humanity
and
science
i
like
that
intersection
there
s
something
magical
about
that
place
there
be
a
lot
of
people
innovate
and
that
s
not
the
main
distinction
of
my
career
the
reason
apple
resonates
with
people
be
that
there
s
a
deep
current
of
humanity
in
our
innovation
i
think
great
artist
and
great
engineer
be
similar
in
that
they
both
have
a
desire
to
express
themselves
in
fact
some
of
the
best
people
work
on
the
original
mac
be
poet
and
musician
on
the
side
in
the
seventy
computer
become
a
way
for
people
to
express
their
creativity
great
artist
like
leonardo
da
vinci
and
michelangelo
be
also
great
at
science
michelangelo
knew
a
lot
about
how
to
quarry
stone
not
just
how
to
be
a
sculptor
people
pay
us
to
integrate
thing
for
them
because
they
don
t
have
the
time
to
think
about
this
stuff
if
you
have
an
extreme
passion
for
produce
great
product
it
push
you
to
be
integrate
to
connect
your
hardware
and
your
software
and
content
management
you
want
to
break
new
ground
so
you
have
to
do
it
yourself
if
you
want
to
allow
your
product
to
be
open
to
other
hardware
or
software
you
have
to
give
up
some
of
your
vision
at
different
time
in
the
past
there
be
company
that
exemplify
silicon
valley
it
be
hewlett
packard
for
a
long
time
then
in
the
semiconductor
era
it
be
fairchild
and
intel
i
think
that
it
be
apple
for
a
while
and
then
that
fade
and
then
today
i
think
it
s
apple
and
google
and
a
little
more
so
apple
i
think
apple
have
stood
the
test
of
time
it
s
be
around
for
a
while
but
it
s
still
at
the
cut
edge
of
what
s
go
on
it
s
easy
to
throw
stone
at
microsoft
they
ve
clearly
fall
from
their
dominance
they
ve
become
mostly
irrelevant
and
yet
i
appreciate
what
they
do
and
how
hard
it
be
they
be
very
good
at
the
business
side
of
thing
they
be
never
as
ambitious
product
wise
as
they
should
have
be
bill
like
to
portray
himself
as
a
man
of
the
product
but
he
s
really
not
he
s
a
businessperson
win
business
be
more
important
than
make
great
product
he
end
up
the
wealthy
guy
around
and
if
that
be
his
goal
then
he
achieve
it
but
it
s
never
be
my
goal
and
i
wonder
in
the
end
if
it
be
his
goal
i
admire
him
for
the
company
he
built
it
s
impressive
and
i
enjoy
work
with
him
he
s
bright
and
actually
have
a
good
sense
of
humor
but
microsoft
never
have
the
humanity
and
liberal
art
in
its
dna
even
when
they
saw
the
mac
they
couldn
t
copy
it
well
they
totally
didn
t
get
it
i
have
my
own
theory
about
why
decline
happens
at
company
like
ibm
or
microsoft
the
company
do
a
great
job
innovates
and
becomes
a
monopoly
or
close
to
it
in
some
field
and
then
the
quality
of
the
product
becomes
less
important
the
company
start
value
the
great
salesman
because
they
re
the
one
who
can
move
the
needle
on
revenue
not
the
product
engineer
and
designer
so
the
salesperson
end
up
run
the
company
john
akers
at
ibm
be
a
smart
eloquent
fantastic
salesperson
but
he
didn
t
know
anything
about
product
the
same
thing
happen
at
xerox
when
the
sale
guy
run
the
company
the
product
guy
don
t
matter
so
much
and
a
lot
of
them
just
turn
off
it
happen
at
apple
when
sculley
come
in
which
be
my
fault
and
it
happen
when
ballmer
take
over
at
microsoft
apple
be
lucky
and
it
rebound
but
i
don
t
think
anything
will
change
at
microsoft
as
long
as
ballmer
be
run
it
i
hate
it
when
people
call
themselves
entrepreneur
when
what
they
re
really
try
to
do
be
launch
a
startup
and
then
sell
or
go
public
so
they
can
cash
in
and
move
on
they
re
unwilling
to
do
the
work
it
take
to
build
a
real
company
which
be
the
hardest
work
in
business
that
s
how
you
really
make
a
contribution
and
add
to
the
legacy
of
those
who
go
before
you
build
a
company
that
will
still
stand
for
something
a
generation
or
two
from
now
that
s
what
walt
disney
do
and
hewlett
and
packard
and
the
people
who
built
intel
they
create
a
company
to
last
not
just
to
make
money
that
s
what
i
want
apple
to
be
i
don
t
think
i
run
roughshod
over
people
but
if
something
suck
i
tell
people
to
their
face
it
s
my
job
to
be
honest
i
know
what
i
m
talk
about
and
i
usually
turn
out
to
be
right
that
s
the
culture
i
try
to
create
we
be
brutally
honest
with
each
other
and
anyone
can
tell
me
they
think
i
be
full
of
shit
and
i
can
tell
them
the
same
and
we
ve
have
some
rip
roar
argument
where
we
be
yell
at
each
other
and
it
s
some
of
the
best
time
i
ve
ever
have
i
feel
totally
comfortable
say
ron
that
store
look
like
shit
in
front
of
everyone
else
or
i
might
say
god
we
really
fuck
up
the
engineering
on
this
in
front
of
the
person
that
s
responsible
that
s
the
ante
for
be
in
the
room
you
ve
get
to
be
able
to
be
super
honest
maybe
there
s
a
well
way
a
gentleman
s
club
where
we
all
wear
tie
and
speak
in
this
brahmin
language
and
velvet
code
word
but
i
don
t
know
that
way
because
i
be
middle
class
from
california
i
be
hard
on
people
sometimes
probably
harder
than
i
need
to
be
i
remember
the
time
when
reed
be
six
year
old
come
home
and
i
have
just
fire
somebody
that
day
and
i
imagine
what
it
be
like
for
that
person
to
tell
his
family
and
his
young
son
that
he
have
lose
his
job
it
be
hard
but
somebody
s
get
to
do
it
i
figure
that
it
be
always
my
job
to
make
sure
that
the
team
be
excellent
and
if
i
didn
t
do
it
nobody
be
go
to
do
it
you
always
have
to
keep
push
to
innovate
dylan
could
have
sung
protest
song
forever
and
probably
make
a
lot
of
money
but
he
didn
t
he
have
to
move
on
and
when
he
do
by
go
electric
in
he
alienate
a
lot
of
people
his
europe
tour
be
his
great
he
would
come
on
and
do
a
set
of
acoustic
guitar
and
the
audience
love
him
then
he
brought
out
what
become
the
band
and
they
would
all
do
an
electric
set
and
the
audience
sometimes
booed
there
be
one
point
where
he
be
about
to
sing
like
a
roll
stone
and
someone
from
the
audience
yell
juda
and
dylan
then
say
play
it
fuck
loud
and
they
do
the
beatles
be
the
same
way
they
kept
evolve
move
refining
their
art
that
s
what
i
ve
always
try
to
do
keep
move
otherwise
as
dylan
say
if
you
re
not
busy
be
born
you
re
busy
die
what
drove
me
i
think
most
creative
people
want
to
express
appreciation
for
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
work
that
s
be
do
by
others
before
us
i
didn
t
invent
the

i
make
little
of
my
own
food
none
of
my
own
clothes
everything
i
do
depends
on
other
member
of
our
specie
and
the
shoulder
that
we
stand
on
and
a
lot
of
us
want
to
contribute
something
back
to
our
specie
and
to
add
something
to
the
flow
it
s
about
try
to
express
something
in
the
only
way
that
most
of
us
know
how
because
we
can
t
write
bob
dylan
song
or
tom
stoppard
play
we
try
to
use
the
talent
we
do
have
to
express
our
deep
feeling
to
show
our
appreciation
of
all
the
contribution
that
come
before
us
and
to
add
something
to
that
flow
that
s
what
have
driven
me
coda
one
sunny
afternoon
when
he
wasn
t
feel
well
job
sat
in
the
garden
behind
his
house
and
reflect
on
death
he
talk
about
his
experience
in
india
almost
four
decade
earlier
his
study
of
buddhism
and
his
view
on
reincarnation
and
spiritual
transcendence
i
m
about
fifty
fifty
on
believe
in
god
he
say
for
most
of
my
life
i
ve
felt
that
there
must
be
more
to
our
existence
than
meet
the
eye
he
admit
that
as
he
face
death
he
might
be
overestimate
the
odds
out
of
a
desire
to
believe
in
an
afterlife
i
like
to
think
that
something
survives
after
you
die
he
say
it
s
strange
to
think
that
you
accumulate
all
this
experience
and
maybe
a
little
wisdom
and
it
just
go
away
so
i
really
want
to
believe
that
something
survives
that
maybe
your
consciousness
endures
he
fell
silent
for
a
very
long
time
but
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
it
s
like
an
on
off
switch
he
say
click
and
you
re
go
then
he
pause
again
and
smile
slightly
maybe
that
s
why
i
never
like
to
put
on
off
switch
on
apple
device
