introduction
when
my
father
die
in
six
week
after
make
me
head
of
ibm
i
be
the
most
frighten
man
in
america
for
ten
year
he
have
groom
me
to
succeed
him
and
i
have
be
the
young
man
in
a
hurry
eager
to
take
over
cocky
and
impatient
now
suddenly
i
have
the
job
but
what
i
didn
t
have
be
dad
there
to
back
me
up
i
d
heard
so
many
story
about
son
of
prominent
men
fail
in
business
and
i
could
imagine
their
devastation
at
find
themselves
unable
to
fill
their
father
shoe
i
worried
i
d
end
up
the
same
way
but
after
my
father
have
be
dead
a
year
i
announce
to
my
wife
i
ve
make
it
through
twelve
month
without
the
old
boy
around
i
go
another
year
and
then
another
the
computer
era
be
begin
and
ibm
be
able
to
capitalize
on
it
while
i
be
chief
executive
the
company
grow
more
than
tenfold
i
like
to
think
that
father
would
have
be
impressed
with
the
billion
a
year
business
i
left
behind
when
i
resign
in
he
have
always
predict
it
would
someday
be
the
big
business
on
earth
i
be
so
intimately
entwine
with
my
father
i
have
a
compelling
desire
maybe
out
of
honor
for
the
old
gentleman
maybe
out
of
sheer
cussedness
to
prove
to
the
world
that
i
could
excel
the
same
way
he
do
i
never
declare
myself
winner
in
that
contest
because
many
of
my
decision
be
base
on
policy
and
practice
learn
at
his
knee
but
i
think
i
be
at
least
successful
enough
that
people
could
say
i
be
the
worthy
son
of
a
worthy
father
it
could
have
turn
out
very
differently
the
kind
of
privileged
upbringing
i
have
private
school
world
travel
wealth
often
lead
to
disaster
for
a
son
i
knew
i
be
suppose
to
follow
in
my
father
s
footstep
but
i
do
not
see
how
that
be
possible
i
be
in
awe
of
the
man
yet
we
both
have
such
hot
temper
that
it
be
hard
for
me
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
him
much
less
try
to
learn
from
him
how
to
run
a
company
i
didn
t
have
much
motivation
as
a
youth
at
brown
university
i
spent
so
much
time
fly
airplane
and
fooling
around
that
i
barely
graduate
in
the
yearbook
you
have
to
have
a
line
next
to
your
photograph
the
only
thing
in
mine
be
the
name
of
the
prep
school
i
d
go
to
there
be
nothing
else
to
say
i
have
no
distinction
no
success
of
my
own
and
only
a
vague
notion
of
how
to
be
sympathetic
and
understand
to
others
i
be
totally
qualify
to
be
either
a
playboy
or
an
airplane
bum
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
world
war
ii
i
might
never
have
become
my
own
man
after
my
favorite
recreation
fly
suddenly
become
serious
business
i
join
the
air
force
as
a
pilot
and
learn
to
be
responsible
for
an
airplane
full
of
men
the
military
take
me
far
outside
my
father
s
influence
and
by
i
have
make
it
to
lieutenant
colonel
though
i
never
get
promote
beyond
that
i
come
back
from
the
war
confident
for
the
first
time
that
i
might
be
capable
of
run
ibm
but
i
d
be
so
unimpressive
before
the
war
that
it
be
hard
for
my
father
to
believe
it
it
take
him
year
to
convince
himself
that
i
d
change
and
i
don
t
think
he
be
ever
completely
sure
you
can
see
that
in
the
photograph
of
us
that
appear
in
the
new
york
time
when
he
turn
ibm
over
to
me
it
show
us
in
our
pin
strip
suit
shake
hand
in
front
of
a
bookcase
on
my
face
be
a
look
of
great
self
assurance
and
i
m
obviously
enjoy
the
occasion
tremendously
but
on
dad
s
face
there
be
a
faint
uncertain
smile
he
ran
ibm
for
forty
two
year
and
i
ran
it
for
fifteen
all
told
nearly
six
decade
of
watson
management
my
job
be
to
lead
the
company
into
the
computer
business
but
it
be
he
who
put
ibm
on
the
map
by
the
time
i
join
the
air
force
he
have
built
the
business
from
almost
nothing
to
revenue
of
nearly
forty
million
dollar
a
year
ibm
be
still
really
an
insignificant
part
of
the
american
industrial
scene
but
thanks
to
t
j
s
genius
for
sell
it
be
fast
grow
and
highly
profitable
and
it
attract
a
lot
of
attention
father
knew
how
to
project
an
image
as
well
as
any
salesman
who
ever
live
at
the
new
york
world
s
fair
of
there
be
a
general
motor
day
a
general
electric
day
and
an
ibm
day
two
elephant
and
a
gnat
all
get
the
same
treatment
we
even
have
mayor
la
guardia
as
our
guest
at
the
fair
president
franklin
roosevelt
whose
confidant
father
have
become
sent
a
greet
by
telegram
during
the
ten
year
after
world
war
ii
father
taught
me
his
business
secret
as
we
work
together
it
be
a
stormy
relationship
in
public
he
would
praise
me
lavishly
and
i
d
hear
from
other
people
the
nice
thing
he
be
say
about
my
shrewdness
and
brain
and
talent
as
a
manager
but
in
private
father
and
i
have
terrible
fight
that
lead
us
again
and
again
to
the
brink
of
estrangement
these
argument
would
frequently
end
in
tear
me
in
tear
and
dad
in
tear
we
fought
about
every
major
issue
of
the
business
how
to
finance
ibm
s
growth
whether
to
settle
or
fight
a
federal
antitrust
suit
what
role
in
ibm
other
member
of
our
family
ought
to
play
from
around
my
goal
one
of
the
thing
on
which
we
never
saw
eye
to
eye
be
to
push
into
computer
as
fast
as
possible
that
meant
hire
engineer
by
the
thousand
and
spending
dollar
by
the
ten
of
million
for
new
factory
and
lab
the
risk
make
dad
balk
even
though
he
sense
the
enormous
potential
of
electronics
as
early
as
i
do
when
i
finally
take
over
i
be
excite
about
change
compute
be
a
brand
new
industry
and
i
always
felt
that
if
ibm
didn
t
grab
the
opportunity
somebody
else
would
so
we
taught
ourselves
to
ride
a
runaway
horse
expand
on
a
scale
that
no
company
have
ever
match
we
grow
so
fast
that
some
year
we
have
to
cope
with
the
problem
of
training
twenty
thousand
or
more
new
employee
i
kept
myself
where
employee
could
see
me
out
in
front
set
a
fast
pace
i
have
learn
from
my
father
that
by
seize
opportunity
for
dramatic
action
personally
answer
an
employee
s
complaint
slash
the
price
of
a
new
computer
that
fail
to
perform
as
promise
i
could
set
an
example
of
how
ibm
should
do
business
at
the
same
time
i
have
yearning
outside
the
company
that
would
have
be
hard
for
my
father
to
understand
in
the
top
drawer
of
my
desk
i
kept
a
list
of
adventure
like
climb
the
matterhorn
and
retrace
the
south
sea
voyage
of
captain
cook
for
which
i
simply
have
no
time
all
that
change
in
when
i
have
a
heart
attack
i
be
only
fifty
six
and
i
think
many
executive
would
have
be
back
in
the
office
before
their
triple
bypass
scar
have
even
heal
but
my
experience
at
the
hospital
change
my
life
i
have
a
chest
pain
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
drove
myself
to
the
emergency
room
they
put
me
on
a
monitor
but
early
the
next
morning
i
stop
the
doctor
and
say
look
i
ve
get
to
get
out
of
here
my
best
friend
be
dead
and
i
ve
get
to
go
to
his
funeral
then
i
have
to
fly
right
out
and
give
the
inaugural
address
at
the
mayo
clinic
medical
school
then
he
told
me
you
re
not
go
anywhere
you
re
have
a
heart
attack
they
move
me
into
intensive
care
the
doctor
mark
newberg
be
someone
i
grow
to
like
very
much
over
the
next
three
week
we
have
long
discussion
and
finally
one
morning
he
look
me
right
in
the
eye
and
say
why
don
t
you
get
out
of
ibm
right
now
i
think
you
ve
prove
just
about
everything
you
can
up
there
he
left
i
didn
t
want
any
lunch
it
be
such
a
shock
by
dinnertime
i
start
think
about
the
responsibility
i
d
carry
for
so
many
year
and
all
the
thing
i
could
do
outside
business
the
next
morning
i
woke
up
at
dawn
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee
at
the
nurse
station
when
i
get
back
to
my
room
sunlight
be
stream
in
the
window
and
i
felt
well
than
i
have
in
decade
it
be
as
if
somebody
have
lift
a
heavy
pack
off
my
back
before
i
left
the
hospital
i
told
the
people
at
ibm
that
i
be
think
of
get
out
the
board
of
director
do
everything
in
the
world
to
keep
me
in
the
company
they
come
to
me
individually
and
as
a
group
but
i
knew
i
be
do
the
right
thing
i
want
to
live
more
than
i
want
to
run
ibm
it
be
a
choice
my
father
never
would
have
make
but
i
think
he
would
have
respect
it
this
be
the
story
of
my
father
and
myself
of
my
year
alone
at
ibm
s
helm
and
of
what
i
ve
do
since
leave
the
company
father
and
i
played
out
our
rivalry
and
our
love
for
each
other
in
the
great
american
business
that
he
create
i
help
build
it
and
then
left
it
behind
me
twenty
year
ago
along
the
way
i
learn
a
great
deal
about
power
be
subject
to
it
strive
for
it
inherit
it
wield
it
and
let
it
go
i
learn
lesson
for
father
who
have
dream
for
their
child
and
for
child
burden
with
parental
expectation
lot
of
son
ask
me
if
they
should
follow
their
father
into
business
my
answer
be
if
you
can
stand

it
in
the
spring
of
not
long
after

want
to
see

very
conscious
of
fireproofing
after
that
the
roof
of
today
s
house
be
make
out
of
slate
in
back
of
the
house
we
d
have
chicken
coop
a
big
vegetable
garden
and
a
pony
corral
all
of
those
be
go
now
but
i
saw
the
long
wind
driveway
where
my
mother
taught
me
to
drive
a
car
when
i
be
eleven
nearby
i
spot
the
two
pond
that
be
a
big
part
of
my
boyhood
that
part
of
new
jersey
be
so
rural
in
those
day
that
right
near
our
town
there
be
people
who
make
a
living
run
traplines
in
the
local
swamp
no
one
live
around
those
pond
when
we
move
in
there
be
only
a
big
wooden
icehouse
where
horse
drawn
sled
would
haul
huge
block
of
ice
in
the
winter
when
i
be
eleven
or
twelve
my
friend
and
i
use
to
take
girl
behind
the
icehouse
to
play
kiss
game
i
want
to
set
the
helicopter
down
and
walk
around
but
now
the
bank
of
the
pond
be
cover
with
house
and
there
be
no
place
to
land
so
i
climbed
up
and
flew
out
along
the
wind
road
we
use
to
drive
to
get
to
dad
s
country
place
a
farm
he
bought
in
when
he
be
feel
the
first
flush
of
wealth
after
run
ibm
for
thirteen
year
the
farm
which
we
call
hill
and
dale
be
near
the
town
of
oldwick
twenty
mile
west
of
short
hill
i
found
oldwick
quite
easily
but
when
i
look
for
hill
and
dale
outside
the
town
there
be
so
many
highway
and
corporate
headquarters
that
i
never
found
it
in
short
hill
i
be
know
as
terrible
tommy
watson
whenever
there
be
trouble
i
seem
to
be
involve
youthful
rebellion
be
not
in
fashion
in
the
s
so
i
be
not
at
all
popular
most
of
the
kid
in
my
school
could
see
that
at
the
slightest
opportunity
i
would
goof
off
and
none
of
them
thought
i
would
amount
to
a
hill
of
bean
i
have
only
a
handful
of
friend
the
other
kid
thought
they
be
superior
bad
still
i
be
very
sensitive
about
the
fact
that
they
avoid
me
when
i
be
ten
a
friend
name
joe
and
i
be
fooling
around
near
a
house
be
work
on
in
our
neighborhood
the
door
to
the
screen
porch
be
open
and
we
could
see
can
of
paint
and
brush
and
turpentine
we
take
a
couple
of
can
and
somehow
end
up
painting
a
street
mother
ask
us
about
this
and
we
confess
that
the
paint
be
steal
she
have
lecture
me
before
about
swipe
thing
to
no
avail
and
i
think
this
time
she
decide
that
unless
she
do
something
dramatic
i
be
go
to
end
up
a
felon
usually
mother
be
mild
and
sweet
temper
but
if
she
thought
thing
be
get
out
of
hand
she
would
move
with
real
force
so
she
take
us
to
the
police
station
she
must
have
call
the
chief
beforehand
he
shook
our
hand
and
say
it
s
nice
to
see
you
i
want
to
tell
you
about
who
we
have
lock
up
here
we
have
people
in
here
for
murder
and
robbery
but
most
of
the
people
who
come
in
be
petty
thief
our
eye
be
wide
open
by
this
time
they
have
a
thing
in
this
police
station
such
as
i
ve
never
see
since
a
stand
up
cage
about
half
the
size
of
a
telephone
booth
the
front
would
swing
open
you
d
straddle
a
bar
and
they
d
lock
you
in
it
must
have
be
for
question
suspect
you
could
move
a
little
bit
but
you
couldn
t
get
out
i
remember
the
feel
of
that
then
the
chief
take
us
to
the
back
and
put
us
in
a
cell
once
you
re
in
jail
it
s
a
terrible
place
to
be
he
say
most
people
turn
into
repeat
offender
and
then
there
go
your
life
i
dreamt
about
it
afterward
get
caught
and
go
to
jail
when
i
hadn
t
do
anything
wrong
mother
really
have
her
hand
full
with
us
she
married
late
at
age
twenty
nine
and
then
have
four
child
in
the
space
of
six
year
me
my
sister
jane
and
helen
and
arthur
whom
everybody
call
dick
even
though
i
be
the
old
mother
do
not
expect
me
to
help
look
after
my
brother
and
sister
so
i
be
pretty
much
on
my
own
as
a
boy
i
love
dick
but
he
be
too
young
to
be
an
interest
companion
helen
the
second
young
be
always
a
cozy
friend
if
she
saw
me
with
a
bag
of
steal
candy
she
d
want
to
know
what
it
be
but
i
could
always
trust
her
to
clam
up
around
our
parent
my
relationship
with
jane
who
be
closest
to
me
in
age
be
more
difficult
she
would
sometimes
join
in
one
of
my
escapade
but
then
she
d
feel
guilty
and
confess
to
dad
get
me
in
trouble
bad
jane
be
father
s
favorite
he
go
far
out
of
his
way
to
accommodate
her
and
she
always
call
him
by
the
odd
name
my
joy
instead
of
daddy
or
father
this
start
as
an
endearment
but
she
kept
it
up
as
long
as
she
live
mother
thought
it
be
inappropriate
for
dad
to
play
favorite
but
there
be
very
little
she
could
do
about
that
relationship
the
fact
that
i
wasn
t
dad
s
favorite
do
not
surprise
me
from
very
early
in
my
life
i
be
convince
that
i
have
something
miss
i
be
never
able
to
connect
completely
with
what
other
people
be
do
there
be
a
film
of
my
first
grade
play
in
photograph
by
my
father
the
boy
be
all
dress
as
bumblebee
and
the
movie
show
us
buzzing
in
and
out
among
little
girl
dress
as
flower
i
m
the
tallest
long
bone
and
ungainly
and
you
can
spot
me
easily
while
the
other
boy
all
have
their
wing
neatly
spread
and
pin
mine
be
flap
around
all
awry
i
keep
reach
back
try
to
set
them
straight
my
lack
of
polish
didn
t
seem
to
hinder
my
father
who
be
on
the
rise
in
short
hill
society
he
join
the
tennis
club
the
school
board
and
the
board
of
director
of
the
local
bank
and
may
have
be
the
only
man
in
short
hill
who
take
his
family
to
europe
every
other
summer
albeit
on
business
dad
quickly
become
a
pillar
of
the
short
hill
episcopal
church
in
spite
of
his
root
as
a
humble
methodist
a
few
family
saw
him
as
nouveau
riche
and
turn
up
their
nose
but
most
of
our
neighbor
admire
dad
he
be
a
tall
man
unathletic
but
fairly
lean
and
always
impeccably
attire
when
we
be
very
young
he
knew
how
to
loosen
up
and
have
fun
with
us
i
have
film
of
him
dress
in
his
three
piece
suit
march
with
us
and
toot
a
horn
in
a
backyard
parade
dad
love
to
ham
it
up
when
our
aunt
and
uncle
and
cousin
visit
for
sunday
dinner
sometimes
he
d
disappear
upstairs
with
mother
and
she
d
help
him
struggle
into
one
of
her
dress
he
d
come
totter
down
the
stair
all
deck
out
in
a
hat
and
veil
and
high
heel
shoe
cling
to
the
banister
on
one
side
with
mother
steady
him
on
the
other
when
i
be
little
i
thought
he
be
the
lively
father
imaginable
but
for
some
reason
his
playfulness
gradually
diminish
and
by
the
time
i
be
ten
or
eleven
dad
act
quite
formal
and
aloof
this
loss
of
warm
companionship
make
me
sad
but
look
back
i
think
the
cause
be
mainly
age
dad
be
thirty
nine
by
the
time
i
be
born
and
the
fact
that
he
be
ten
year
old
than
most
other
boy
father
make
it
difficult
for
us
to
be
pal
he
wasn
t
one
to
come
out
and
play
ball
or
invite
me
for
a
hike
around
the
local
reservoir
father
must
have
know
he
have
an
uncontrollable
temper
that
might
feed
on
itself
because
when
there
be
punish
to
be
do
he
make
mother
do
it
these
punishment
become
a
sort
of
ritual
i
would
go
up
with
the
two
of
them
to
their
big
white
tile
bathroom
father
would
stand
over
near
his
basin
to
observe
i
would
hold
onto
a
towel
rack
and
mother
would
do
the
switch
i
quickly
developed
a
sense
of
what
be
fair
and
just
which
these
punishment
to
my
mind
sometimes
be
not
i
ll
never
forget
one
switch
i
get
when
i
be
ten
it
be
march
the
snow
be
melt
and
my
parent
have
give
me
new
rubber
boot
i
rush
right
out
of
the
house
and
to
test
the
boot
step
down
into
a
hole
that
have
water
in
it
it
be
deeper
than
i
thought
and
water
pour
in
over
the
top
mother
and
dad
insist
that
i
have
soak
myself
on
purpose
soon
i
be
face
the
towel
rack
think
i
be
get
rook
switching
didn
t
stop
me
from
get
into
trouble
however
the
follow
winter
i
kept
ask
father
for
a
leather
coat
they
make
double
breast
leather
coat
for
kid
in
those
day
that
come
down
to
about
mid
thigh
finally
my
father
present
one
to
me
with
great
pride
for
my
eleventh
birthday
come
home
from
school
the
next
day
some
buddy
and
i
make
a
fire
it
s
fascinate
to
make
fire
when
you
re
young
i
d
be
reading
about
indian
and
smoke
signal
so
i
take
that
beautiful
leather
coat
that
have
be
on
my
back
only
once
and
use
it
with
another
guy
to
make
signal
from
the
fire
then
i
try
to
clean
it
up
and
couldn
t
there
be
big
burn
all
through
it
i
felt
awful
about
what
i
d
do
but
that
make
no
difference
when
i
told
my
parent
they
switch
me
anyway
life
didn
t
go
much
well
for
me
at

the

a
time

and
he

throughout
the

these

not
move
smoothly
from
one
minute
to
the
next
they
would
stay
on
until
the
main

then
they
d
all
go
click
click
and
move
up
one
minute

get
to

i
get
out

it
be
year

the
area
in
which
i
really
stood
out
my
conduct
mark
be
the
bad
you
could
get
fifty
demerit
a
semester
at
short
hill
country

school
without
be
thrown
out
i
d

and
sometimes
more
than
forty
to
work
off
demerit
you
have
to
run
lap
around
the
building
on
saturday

i
sometimes
have
to
run
fifty
lap
while
other
people
be
do
ten
for
some
reason
be
punish
only
drove
me
to
great
mischief
when
i
be
about
twelve
i
met
craig
kingsbury
an
outdoorsman
type
not
much
old
than
i
who
go

in
a

squirrel
i
have
shot
when
he
mention

didn
t
take
me
an
instant
to
zero
in
what
do
you
do

turn
out
that
kingsbury

how
to
extract

and
put

i
bought
some
from
him
at

just
before

i
sneak
down
to
the
furnace
and
examine
the
duct
go
off
in
various
direction
i
thought
that
if
you
put
something
in
the
main
vent
it
would
spread
through
the
whole
building
so
i
dumped
in
the
entire
bottle
ran
upstairs
and
go
to
the
assembly
hall
a
hundred
kid
be
sit
there
along
with
the
teacher
and
the
headmaster
mr
lance
a
straitlaced
disciplinarian
who
knew
me
well
there
be
a
terrible
stink
and
the
longer
we
sat
the
bad
the
stink
get
finally
mr
lance
say
be
there
anyone
who
know
anything
about
this
detestable
smell
there
be
a
long
silence
we
have
an
honor
system
so
eventually
i
raise
my
hand
watson
yes
sir
stand
up
yes
sir
what
do
you
know
about
this
i
explain
what
i
d
do
how
i
d
gotten
the
skunk
juice
and
i
pull
the
bottle
out
of
my
pocket
to
show
him
everyone
back
away
a
little
then
the
teacher
open
all
the
window
and
try
to
fan
out
the
smell
finally
mr
lance
decide
the
school
have
to
close
it
be
my
moment
of
ultimate
triumph
whatever
happen
to
me
as
a
result
be
worth
it
mr
lance
didn
t
know
how
to
deal
with
me
his
first
idea
be
to
tie
the
empty
skunk
juice
bottle
around
my
neck
but
that
be
too
minor
a
punishment
because
i
be
get
use
to
the
smell
by
then
and
it
didn
t
bother
me
very
much
his
next
move
be
more
effective
there
be
a
school
board
meeting
that
night
mr
lance
wait
until
it
convene
and
then
described
my
transgression
to
the
chagrin
of
my
father
who
be
on
the
board
by
the
time
he
get
home

be
in

fury

begin
by

it
be
wrong
for
me
to
have
force
the
school
to
close
thereby
deprive
my
sister
and
other
honest
child
of
the
opportunity
to
learn
father
never
struck
me
but
this
time
he
come
close
and
i
bolt
he
chase
me
and
roar
i
don

you
little
skunk
my

in
stage
the
more
he
saw
of

more
he
want

the

remark
that

for
the
first
several
year
he
seem
predestine
to
fail
he
go
to
the
city
of
buffalo
to
find
work
when
he
be
nineteen
but
sell
sew
machine
to
farmer
wasn
t
very
good
preparation
for
what
he
encounter
buffalo
in
the
s
be
a
sprawl
rough
unfriendly
place
in
the
middle
of
a
recession
job
be
scarce
and
soon
dad
be
hard
up
he
told
me
that
at
one
point
he
be
reduce
to
sleep
on
a
pile
of
sponge
in
the
basement
of
a
drugstore
he
have
only
one
suit
to
his
name
and
when
he
could
afford
to
get
it
press
he
have
to
wait
in
the
back
of
the
tailor
shop
in
his
underwear
until
it
be
ready
the
first
man
in
buffalo
to
recognize
his
talent
be
a
salesman
name
c
b
barron
who
take
dad
on
as
his
assistant
barron
unfortunately
be
a
flamboyant
city
slicker
who
sell
stock
in
the
northern
new
york
state
building
and
loan
association
up
and
down
the
shore
of
lake
erie
dad
thought
barron
be
the
most
worldly
and
charm
fellow
he
d
ever
met
he
be
too
naive
to
see
that
the
guy
be
a
crook
when
barron
come
into
a
town
he
d
rent
the
fine
room
at
the
local
hotel
and
then
say
to
the
bell
captain
i
m
c
b
barron
i
want
to
be
page
three
time
during
dinner
i
have
reason
for
it
not
important
to
you
here
be
a
couple
of
dollar
soon
word
would
get
around
that
there
be
an
important
stranger
in
town
who
have
come
to
sell
share
in
the
building
and
loan
the
stock
itself
be
legitimate
investor
paid
for
it
in
installment
like
a
saving
plan
barron
would
keep
the
first
payment
as
his
commission
which
enable
him
to
live
pretty
high
a
photo
of
dad
from
that
period
show
barron
s
influence
my
father
be
sit
on
a
stump
and
look
like
a
caricature
of
the
turn
of
the
century
travel
man
with
his
silk
hat
frock
coat
high
button
shoe
strip
sock
and
ridiculous
handlebar
mustache
his
share
of
the
building
and
loan
commission
amount
to
more
money
than
he
d
ever
see
and
dad
decide
to
go
into
business
for
himself
on
the
side
he
open
a
butcher
shop
in
buffalo
intend
to
use
future
proceeds
from
his
work
with
barron
to
start
more
and
more
store
chain
store
be
just
begin
to
spread
around
america
then
and
the
idea
of
run
a
retail
empire
appeal
to
my
father
but
in
less
than
a
year
it
all
fell
apart
dad
woke
up
one
morning
on
a
sale
trip
to
find
that
barron
have
take
off
with
their
fund
since
dad
have
no
saving
to
fall
back
on
instead
of
be
able
to
open
his
second
butcher
shop
he
have
to
sell
the
first
my
father
have
the
ability
to
overcome
setback
that
would
have
sent
other
young
men
back
to
the
farm
later
on
this
optimism
come
out
in
slogan
that
everybody
in
ibm
have
to
learn
make
thing
happen
ever
onward
beat
your
best
and
so
on
he
knew
how
to
find
opportunity
where
none
seem
to
be
such
as
in
the
remnant
of
his
butcher
shop
business
he
have
bought
a
cash
register
for
the
store
on
the
installment
plan
and
when
he
go
downtown
to
transfer
responsibility
for
the
payment
to
the
new
owner
he
use
the
occasion
to
talk
his
way
into
a
job
with
the
national
cash
register
company
that
be
the
lucky
break
that
make
his
career
the
cash
as
it
be
call
be
one
of
america
s
best
know
company
it
belong
to
john
henry
patterson
a
fierce
little
tycoon
from
dayton
who
be
on
a
campaign
to
make
the
cash
register
an
indispensable
fixture
in
every
modern
store
have
use
a
cash
register
himself
my
father
thought
he
could
convince
other
store
owner
of
its
virtue
and
he
be
right
he
soon
become
one
of
the
top
salesman
at
the
cash
patterson
who
show
up
in
business
history
as
the
father
of
modern
salesmanship
be
in
effect
my
business
grandfather
dad
work
for
him
for
eighteen
year
and
learn
from
him
many
of
the
idea
that
built
ibm
patterson
s
genius
be
to
figure
out
how
to
take
crude
partly
educate
ambitious
commercial
traveler
like
dad
and
mold
them
into
america
s
first
national
sale
force
he
make
his
salesman
memorize
and
use
standardize
sale
pitch
inspire
them
with
revival
like
meeting
and
challenged
and
bully
them
into
hit
sale
quota
that
be
sky
high
one
of
his
innovation
be
to
break
up
each
sale
region
into
exclusive
territory
so
no
salesman
have
to
worry
about
others
from
the
company
steal
his
prospect
since
the
cash
have
a
virtual
monopoly
on
the
cash
register
business
these
territory
be
valuable
indeed
patterson
paid
extraordinarily
well
it
wasn
t
unusual
for
a
man
with
only
a
few
year
experience
to
make
one
hundred
dollar
a
week
which
have
the
buying
power
of
fifteen
hundred
dollar
today
be
a
salesman
at
the
turn
of
the
century
be
an
ignoble
job
but
under
patterson
it
become
almost
a
profession
my
father
rise
through
the
rank
at
the
cash
register
company
and
by
the
time
he
and
mother
met
sixteen
year
later
he
be
patterson
s
second
in
command
tall
handsome
and
well
turn
out
dad
be
also
dayton

in
style
he
set
them
up
in
a
fine
stone
house
in
rochester
new

where
he
d
run
a
sale

and
he
found

my
aunt

marry
but
he
put

to
me
because
he
have
see
successful
men
who
married
without
much
thought
of
the
future
and
then
found
themselves
burden
with
wife
who
couldn
t
keep
up
as
they
rise
in
the

and

who
always
like
the
idea
of
his
employee
gain
status
in
dayton

when
my

dad
probably
shouldn
t
have
be
surprised
the
way
he
described
patterson
it
be
hard
to
imagine
a
more
arbitrary
and
eccentric
bos
patterson
manage
his
people
by
pressure
and
fear
once
when
he
thought
the
men
weren
t
pay
attention
during
a
long
sale
meeting
patterson
grabbed

but
on
the

he
didn
t
like
sometimes
with
real
cruelty
dad
told
the
story
of
an
executive
who
show
up
for
work
one
morning
not
know
mr
patterson
be
angry
with
him
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
cash
he
found
his
desk
and
the
content
of
his
office
soak
with
kerosene
and
set
on
fire
he
left
without
ever
go
into
the
building
even
though
dad
later
become
famous
for
his
autocratic
style
at
ibm
compare
to
patterson
he
be
mild

always
fire
his
best
men
he
own
almost
all
of
national
cash
register
s
stock
but
he
be
irrationally
afraid
that
an
employee
would
somehow
take
the
company
away
from
him
the
end
come
for
dad
after
a
vice
president
name
edward
deed
whisper
to
patterson
that
my
father
be
develop
quite
a
follow
among
the
rank
and
file
in
as
dad
address
a
sale
convention
patterson
go
to
the
podium
and
interrupt
the
speech
he
begin
lavishly
praise
the
other
people
present
and
ignore
dad
completely
dad
s
desk
never
get
set
on
fire
but
after
a
time
he
be
no
longer
invite
to
meeting
or
consult
on
important
decision
he
felt
devastate
and
after
a
few
month
he
resign
oddly
dad
never
complain
of
this
treatment
and
revere
patterson
until
the
day
he
die
he
use
to
say
nearly
everything
i
know
about
building
a
business
come
from
mr
patterson
the
man
father
hat
be
deed
for
set
him
up
he
encounter
deed
later
on
several
occasion
but
he
never
spoke
to
him
again
the
winter
of
early
must
have
be
pretty
grim
for
my
father
although
he
be
far
from
broke
after
push
him
out
patterson
have
give
him
a
massive
fifty
thousand
dollar
severance
payment
and
also
let
him
keep
his
pierce
arrow
car
but
dad
s
carefully
built
up
security
be
go
he
be
out
of
work
and
about
to
turn
forty
he
have
a
new
wife
and
son
to
support
and
no
place
to
live
the
house
in
dayton
belong
to
patterson
there
be
no
other
job
for

and
he
take
mother
and
me
with
him
to
new
york
in
order
to
hunt
for
work
i
ve
always
be
impressed
with
how
picky
he
be
about
what
he
d
do
next
he
once
explain
this
by
say
he
be
sure
he
d
find
a
job
because
he
have
a
reputation
for
be

remington
arm
with

come
in
europe
these
would
have
be
very
lucrative
position
but
dad
figure
that
both
firm
would
shrink
as
soon
as
the
fight
stop
he
reject
a
job
at
dodge
motor
because
the
dodge
brother
would
not
give
him
the
sort
of
contract
he
be
after
he
want
to
be
an
entrepreneur
like
patterson
with
a
share
in
the
company
s
profit
and
not
simply
a
hire
manager
yet
he
have
no
capital
to
buy
his
own
firm
and
no
promising
idea
of
his
own
to
commercialize
eventually

might
have
gotten
anxious

dad
copy
whatever
seem
bad
he
boldly
reverse
his
code
of
discipline
for
ctr
employee
be
just
as
rigid
as
that
of
the

but
his
philosophy
of
management
be
far
more
humane
patterson
love
to
make
head
roll
but
when
dad
arrive
at
ctr
he
make
a
point
of
fire
no
one
he
told
the
men
that
he
be
go
to
depend
on
them
and
that
his
job
would
be
to
build
them
up
since
he
d
work
hard
to
pull
himself
up
from
the
farm
dad
knew
that
the
way
to
win
a
man
s
loyalty
be
by
bolster
his
self
respect
when
i
join
ibm
many
year
later
the
company
be
famous
for
high
pay
generous
benefit
and
the
intense
devotion
of
the
employee
to
dad
but
back
at
the
begin
when
there
be
hardly
any
money
dad
gain
their
loyalty
with
word
my
father
love
to
recall
his
and
flint
s
discussion
of
compensation
on
the
day
flint
offer
him
the
job
he
say
to
flint
i
want
a
gentleman
s
salary
so
that
i
can
support
my
family
and
i
want
a
percentage
of
the
profit
that
remain
after
the
stockholder
get
their
dividend
flint
go
right
to
the
heart
of
it
and
say
i
understand
you
want
a
peck
of
the
corn
you
harvest
when
flint
present
this
arrangement
to
the
other
director
they
be
incredulous
because
it
be
hard
to
imagine
that
there
would
ever
be
surplus
profit
to
divvy
up
but
by
the
time
i
be
in
college
a
version
of
the
formula
they
agree
to
would
make
dad
the
high
paid
man
in
america
late
in
his
life
my
father
would
take
a
pencil
and
do
scratch
calculation
of
his
own
fortune
tot
up
his
net
worth
he
carry
these
scrap
of
paper
around
sometimes
i
d
find
them
and
throw
them
away
sometimes
i
d
keep
them
they
show
that
not
until
the
mid
s
be
he
in
a
position
to
stop
worry
about
debt
he
be
sixty
year
old

the
time
he
be
really
on
easy
street
the

he
take
with

amaze
to
me
for
the
first
eight
year
of
his
married
life

be
pretty
much
on
a
shoestring
at
any
point
he
probably
owe
at

one
hundred
thousand
dollar
he
never

any

the
first
two
summer

take
us

soon
as
he
d
get
a
little

would
buy

he
felt
it
be
a
damn
good
buy
he
bought
on
margin
in
the
begin
those
be
the
day
when
you
only
have
to
put
up
ten
percent
of
the

price
as
the
stock
go
up
his
broker
friend
would
say
tom
you
ought
to
take
some
profit

he
d
come
home
indignant
that
someone

he
should
sell
more
than
once
this
investment

if
it
can

like
a
big
mistake

nearly
go

by
heavy
borrowing

relatively
well
but
by
the

have
fall
more

two
hundred

and
dad
have
to
borrow
on
everything
to
keep
up

told
me
that

another
three

four

he
would

in
the
late
s
when

seem
likely
he
thought
it
be
remotely
possible
that
some
unforeseen
catastrophe
might
wreck

he
told
me
he
want
our

him
that
he
couldn

walk
down
two
flight

stair
to
turn

game
one
night
a
stuffy
businessman
from
switzerland
stayed
at
our
house
and
left
his
shoe
outside
the
guest
room

herself
my

a
great
deal
by
the
time
they
met
he
have
already
learn
how
to
dress
and
how
to
give
a
speech
but
the
nuance
of
gentle
living
sometimes
escape
him
she
help
greatly
with
that
when
we
be
young
she
d
correct
dad
s
english
watch
his
table
manner
and
caution
him
not
to
lose
his
temper
her
lesson
to
him
could
be
pretty
brisk
after
he
be
make
a
lot
of
money
in
the
s
he
come
home
one
day
and
proudly
give
her
a
big
diamond
ring
it
be
the
first
expensive
piece
of
jewelry
he
d
ever
bought
not
a
really
good
diamond
just
big
as
big
as
an
aspirin
it
must
have
weigh
two
carat
mother
point
out
that
it
be
flaw
and
that
she
would
have
prefer
a
small
diamond
that
be
perfect
rather
than
a
large
diamond
that
wasn
t
this
stung
dad
he
take
the
ring
back
and
some
year
later
produce
one
that
be
equally
large
but
perfect
it
must
have
cost
a
fortune
mother
be
short
maybe
five
foot
four
and
fairly
thin
and
she
always
kept
her
gray
brown
hair
long
and
pull
back
into
a
bun
her

be
naturally
callous

make
them
soft
she
work
on
them
every
night
with
a
pumice
stone
she
have
a
gentle
mouth
appeal
eye

straight
interest
nose
even
though
dad
often
overshadow

we

powerful
streak
of

she
invite

cellar
there
be
clothesline
strung

ceiling
that
mother
and
her
friend
held
on
to
to
steady
themselves
as

practice
because
she
be
more
handy
than

of

my
father

that
must
have
rubbed

a
little
profane
in
those
day
and
he

the
hell
with

i
so
mother

downstairs
and
checked
the

february
night
in
when
this
division
of
labor
between
my
parent
didn
t
stick
and
dad
burn
down
the
house
he
be
try
to
break
in
a
new
houseman
and
say
to
mother
carlo
doesn
t
know
how
to
build
a

i
ll
show
him
so
he
pile
the
fireplace
high
with

and
touch
it
off
an
hour
or
so
later
i
start
wail
upstairs
i
be
only

and
often
cry
after

i
think
she
understood
that
at
the
root
of
my
odd
and
mischievous
behavior
be
a
lack
of
self
esteem
because
she
be
forever
invent

garden
i
built
a
fire
get
a
couple
of
potato
and
threw
them
in
she
stayed
right
there
with
me
watch
the
whole
procedure
it
take
an
hour
so
we
walk
around
a
bit
finally
i
take
a
black
char
potato
out
of
the
fire
and
broke
it
open
i
didn
t
even
have

more
upset
i
be
at
the
way
i
thought
dad

her
this
be
when
ibm
be
at
a
critical
stage
demand
a
lot
of
dad
s
attention
in
his
office
he
could
press
the
button
on
his
desk
a
fellow
would
come
in
dad
would
say
send
a
letter
and
boom
it
would
happen
when
he
wasn
t
think
he
expect
mother
to
obey
him
in
the
same
way
she
found
that
hard
to
put
up
with
so
in
the
year
when
dad
be
most
intense
about
his
work
there
be
enormous
tension
in
our
household
i
remember
incessant
argument
between
them
the
door
to
their
bedroom
would
be
close
but
my
brother
and
sister
and
i
would
hear
angry
muffle
voice
rise
and
fall
father
would
be
rude
to
her
and
then
half
an
hour
later
he
d
give
us
a
lecture
about
how
we
ought
to
be
good
to
our
mother
i
never
have
the
gut
to
say
then
why
aren
t
you
father
would
sometimes
act
as
though
he
d
completely
forgotten
how
much
he
have
depend
on
mother
in
the
early
day
of
their
marriage
he
d
call
from
the
city
and
say
now
jeannette
i
ve
ask
all
the
district
manager
to
come
out
tonight
for
a
little
supper
that
would
mean
eight
guest
and
this
news
would
be
deliver
at
three
in
the
afternoon
mother
who
didn
t
have
nearly
his
stamen
to

him
to
dinner
or
the
opera
another
big
source
of
strain

be
torture
for
mother
as
frugal
as
she
be
to
see
the
style
in
which
they
be
living
and
the
debt
he
be
run
up
then
after
about
ten
year
of
strife
around
the
time
i
be
fourteen
and
the
other
child

down
to

mother
suddenly
seem
to
capitulate
this
shock
me
i
thought
she
d
stop
stand
up
for
herself
but
many
year
later

confide
that
in
fact

brought
it
up
again
after
she

that
conscious
decision
to
preserve
the
marriage
she
never
complain
when
a
crowd
of
guest
would
suddenly
arrive
and
she
have
no
one
to

in
the
kitchen
she
d
simply
smile

of
a
car
or
train
calm
him
down
and
make

in
spite
of
the
hundred
of
thousand
of
mile
they

my

i
use
to
love

have
an

but
i
thought

tremendous
because
he
talk
airplane
dad
become
scar
of
airplane
during
a
sunday

for
five
dollar
since
he
d
spent
so
many
year
in
dayton
it
would
have
be
odd
if
dad
have
never
be
curious
enough
to
go
up
he
d
even
met
the
wright
brother
so
he
bought
a
ticket
and
join
the
line
but
as
he
stood
there
wait
we
kid

yap
at
him
you
promise
to
buy
us
ice
cream
father
say
we
be
right
and
ask
the
flier
if
he
could
come
back
in
half
an
hour
for
his
ride
by
the
time
we
come
back
the
plane
have
crashed
and
three
people
have
be
kill
he
take
that
as
an
omen
that
he
should
never
fly
i
have
to
admit
that
in
those
day
there
be
every
reason
for
him
not
to
before
world
war
ii
airplane
be
crash
all
the
time
anyone
who
be
a
sportsman
have
to
have
an
airplane
and
often
the
plane
would
malfunction
or
he
d
make
a
mistake
and
he
d
be
kill
but
dad
s
superstition
never
make
me
hesitate
a
year
after
the
jenny
incident
a
fellow
announce
with
placard
that
he
be
go
to
land
an
airplane
on
a
golf
course
near

per
minute
father
be
have
a
district
manager
meeting
at
our
house
and
i
badger
those
men
privately
and
get
a
buck
from
each
although
father
be
annoyed
when
he
found
out
he
say
patiently
i
m
not
go
to
let
you
go
up
in
that
airplane
i
think
they
re
still
get
them
improve
but
if
you
ll
give
these
gentleman
their
money

a
young
couple
travel
with

i
plead
to

and
the
hancock
and
i
get
in
with
one
other
passenger
two
sat
backwards
and
two
sat
forward
the
whole
cabin
smell
of
castor
oil
then
the
best
lubricant
for
difficult
job
the
pilot
sat
up
above
and
forward
where
we
couldn
t
even
see
his
leg
as
we
taxi
out
the
engine
which
be
probably
four
hundred
horsepower
just
rumble
and
stumble
then
he
open
it
up
to
take
off
and
we
be
engulfed
with
noise
it
seem
to
take
over
until
there
be
no
other
sensation
we
be
roll
on
grass
so
the
undercarriage
be
bumping
pretty
hard
then
suddenly
everything
except
the
noise
stop
and
a
terrific
smoothness
take
over
i
watch
the
ground
fall
away
we
have
big
window
on
both
side
so
we
could
see
everything
after
we
go
around
a
few
time
we
head
down
then
the
engine
noise
drop
and
be
replace
by
a
sing
few
people
today
have
ever
heard
that
sound
it
come
only
from
old
biplane
with
many
wire
between
their
wing
that
sing
as
the
wind
pass
to
keep
the
engine
clear
the
pilot
open
the
throttle
every
once
in
a
while
as
the
ground
approach
the
whistle
get
quieter
and
the
tail
be
drop
and
drop
finally
we
make
a
smooth
land
and
i
could
feel
the
wheel
thump
on
the
grass
again
i
be
overwhelmed
i
knew
airplane
kill
people
but
the
sensation
of
freedom
the
noise
the
unseen
bump
that
push
the
airplane
up
and
down
the
ability
to
choose
one
s
own
angle
of
bank
and
make
one
s
own
decision
to
climb
or
descend
all
these
combine
to
give
me
a
powerful
desire
to
learn
to
fly
i
plead
to
go
right
back
up
but
i
have
to
wait
a
few
year
before
my
second
flight
again
in
europe
in
the
fall
of
this
time
i
actually
go
somewhere
i
be
wander
around
a
hotel
lobby
in
basel
and
saw
an
air

next
to
the
desk
there
be
a
four
o
clock
flight
to

this
announcement
and
before
father
could
send
a
negative
signal
mr
mangan
say
oh

thrill

ll
go

about
two
hundred
fifty
mile
away
and
the
flight
take
almost
four
hour
we
arrive
early
enough
in
the
even
for
me
to
go
to
the
movie
as
it
happen
they
be
show
the
jazz
singer
the
first
film
with

single
fantastic
day
i
d
become
the
first
watson
to
travel
by
air
and
the
first
to

like
to
have
you
follow
me
in
this
business
in
fact
look
at
me
then
he
probably
found
it
hard
to
imagine
a
less
likely
successor
but
i
get
it
into
my
head
that
the
old
man
want
me
to
come
into
ibm
take
it
over
and
run
the
whole
deal
the
very
idea
make
me
miserable
one
day
after
school
when
i
be
about
twelve
i
sat
on
a
curb
think
about
my
father
what
precipitate
it
i
don
t
know
but
by
the
time
i
get

be
in
tear
my
mother
ask
what
be
wrong
and

but
nobody
ask
you
to
yeah
but
i
know
dad
want
me
to
and
i
just
can
t
do
it
she
say
i
shouldn
t
worry
and
put
her
arm
around
me
when
dad
come
home
mother
told
him
how
i
felt
he
gently
say
to
me
that
his
own
father
have
want
him
to
become
a
lawyer
and
that
i
should
do
exactly
what
i
want
from
then
on
he
be
always
offering
me
alternative
this
happen
at
a
time
when
everything
be
out
of
kilter
for
me
even
more
so
than
for
most
adolescent
i
be
tall
and
gangly
and
thin
have
grown
to
a
man
s
height
much
too
fast
my
father
s
power
and
success
in
the
world
be
mushroom
just
when
i
be
try
subconsciously
to
match
myself
with
him
man
to
man
i
be
subject
to
terrible
emotional
low
that
last
week
at
a
time
no
matter
what
he
say
about
alternative
career
dad
s
real
hope
for
me
be
obvious
in
a
photograph
of
us
he
and
i
be
stand
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
almost
equal
in
height
we
be

exactly
alike
with
heavy
somber
suit
overcoat
and
derby
we
be
on
our
way
to
a
sale
convention
in
atlantic
city
i
be
thirteen
a
little
young
for
business
clothes
my
first
memory
of
ibm
be
from
when
i
be
five
and
dad
take
me
through
the
dayton
factory
where
we
make
scale
i
remember
the
acrid
metallic
smell
of
the
assembly
line
and
the
smoke
and
noise
of
metal
cast
from
then
on
dad
often
brought
me
to
ibm
meeting
which
be
quite
small
in
those
day
because
the
whole
company
be
small
sometimes
the
chauffeur
would
pick
me
up
in
short
hill
and
take
me
to
dad
s
office
downtown
this
be
in
the
early
s
before
ibm
start
fill
up
building
in
midtown
manhattan
the
company
occupy
a
couple
of
floor
near
wall
street
in
the
same
building
where
mr
flint
work
those
room
at
broad
street
seem
gloomy
because
the
receptionist
sat
in
the
center
of
the
building
you
d
step
out
of
the
elevator
go
through
a
glass
door
and
there
she
be
there
be
no
window
to
be
see
some
light
but
not
very
many
normally
the
receptionist
would
say
oh
hello
tommy
be
you
look
for
your
father
he
have
a
corner
office
with
an
oriental
rug
and
a
big
mahogany
desk
that
have
belong
to
me
ever
since
he
die
around
the
room
be
a
picture
of
dad
shake
hand
with
nicholas
murray
butler
the
head
of
columbia
university
and
dad
s
first
important
friend
in
new
york
a
couple
of
medal
dad
get
for
join
some
society
a
few
memento
of
his
boyhood
and
maybe
a
stone
or
two
from
faraway
place
for
paperweight
the
place
smell
of
cigar
usually
i
would
make
a
beeline
for
the
machine
room
a
few
floor
below
this
be
where
they
use
punch
card
machine
to
keep
record
of
ibm
s
own
sale
network
in
those
day
the
network
be
pretty
thin
in
fact
the
los
angeles
salesman
have
to
cover
a
region
that
stretch
all
the
way
to
el
paso
clerk
would
be
shove
stack
of
punch
card
into
tabulate
machine
and
vertical
sorter
and
sometimes
i
d
accidentally
knock
the
card
over
and
foul
up
their
work
keypunch
machine
produce
terrific
confetti
the
tiny
little
rectangle
of
cardboard
that
result
when
you
punch
a
hole
in
the
card
those
little
cutout
would
collect
at
the
punch
and
then
would
be
sell
back
to
paper
manufacturer
but
if
there
be
a
parade
on
broadway
many
flight
below
the
clerk
would
dump
some
of
this
stuff
out
the
window
i
love
to
throw
handful
of
it
whenever
i
get
the
chance
all
son
at
some
point
have
the
idea
that
their
father
be
the
most
important
man
in
the
world
but
that
impression
be
hard
to
outgrow
when
your
old
man
s
photograph
be
in
every
office
and
everybody
around
be
bow
and
scrap
and
try
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
him
everything
he
do
left
me
feel
inconsequential
by
comparison
the
bad
be
when
he
be
do
something
that
he
thought
would
make
me
happy
once
know
my
interest
in
fly
he
decide
to
introduce
me
to
charles
lindbergh
whom
he
didn
t
even
know
this
be
soon
after
lindbergh
s
transatlantic
flight
in
and
dad
bought
ticket
to
a
banquet
in
his
honor
dad
lead
me
right
up
to
the
dais
and
introduce
himself
as
head
of
ibm
and
then
me
he
have
such
astonish
brass
i
think
i
stammer
congratulation
in
self
defense
i
developed
an
internal
streak
of
skepticism
about
my
father
s
world
the
first
glimmer
of
this
have
come
several
year
earlier
on
the
winter
day
in
when
ibm
get
its
name
i
be
only
ten
at
the
time
still
in
knee
pant
father
come
home
from
work
give
mother
a
hug
and
proudly
announce
that
the
compute
tabulate
record
company
henceforth
would
be
know
by
the
grand
name
international
business
machine
i
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
living
room
think
that
little
outfit
dad
must
have
have
in
mind
the
ibm
of
the
future
the
one
he
actually
ran
be
still
full
of
cigar
chomp
guy
sell
coffee
grinder
and
butcher
scale
that
didn
t
stop
him
from
try
to
raise
the
tone
as
best
he
knew
how
the
top
showroom
like
the
one
at
fifth
avenue
always
have
oriental
rug
i
guess
dad
thought
link
oriental
rug
and
meat
scale
be
splendid
but
i
found
it
embarrass
while
dad
be
willing
to
delegate
much
of
my
upbringing
to
other
people
he
be
the
one
who
taught
me
how
to
look
and
act
like
a
gentleman
to
him
these
be
among
the
most
important
skill
in
life
and
he
have
work
hard
to
master
them
his
favorite
method
be
to
take
me
on
trip
to
upstate
new
york
for
example
where
his
family
have
live
to
see
a
relative
or
visit
a
grave
he
knew
all
about
railroad
i
suppose
he
d
spent
hundred
of
night
on
train
on
the
first
such
trip
when
i
be
about
twelve
dad
show
me
how
to
use
the
ladder
to
get
to
the
upper
berth
and
how
to
button
the
curtain
for
privacy
then
he
take
me
into
the

there
be
no

there
i
throw
the
towel
away
in
this
receptacle
and
now
i
start
clean
i
lather
my
face
i
shave
i
brush
my
teeth
i
wander
off
while
he
go
through
this
fifteen
minute
routine
he
call
me
back
when
he
be
finish
and

he
clean
it
up
clean
as
a
whistle
he
say
that
s
it
then
the
next
fellow
have
the
same
chance
you
have
i
notice
he
always
tipped
the
porter
on
these
trip
on
a
trip
to
chicago
he
tipped
the
man
ten
dollar
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
money
in
those
day
the
porter
would
always
say
mr
watson
sir
nice
to
see
you
and
it
wasn
t
until
i
notice
those
tip
that
i
figure
it
out
i
say
dad
that
s
an
awful
lot
of
money
to
give
a
pullman
car
fellow
i
do
that
for
two
reason
tom
he
say
first
that
fellow
have
be
up
all
night
in
his
little
cubicle
and
i
feel
sorry
for
him
the
second
reason
be
that
there
be
a
whole
class
of
people
in
the
world
who
be
in
a
position
to
poor
mouth
you
unless
you
be
sensitive
to
them
they
be
the
headwaiter
pullman
car
conductor
porter
and
chauffeur
they
see
you
in
an
intimate
fashion
and
can
really
knock
off
your
reputation
these
trip
always
seem
as
if
they
might
be
the
start
of
a
warm
and
intimate
friendship
between
dad
and
me
but
when
we
get
home
dad
would
always
become
aloof
again
i
could
never
understand
why
he
retreat
maybe
he
really
be
too
old
to
remember
what
it
be
like
to
be
a
boy
or
maybe
just
too
busy
when
he
couldn
t
spend
time
with
me
himself
my
father
would
farm
me
out
to
an
employee
most
often
this
would
be
his
personal
secretary
mr
phillips
george
phillips
who
start
life
as
an
accountant
end
up
as
president
and
then
vice
chairman
of
ibm
after
world
war
ii
during
father
s
decline
year
phillips
be
the
perfect
man
friday
he
first
go
to
work
for
dad
in
and
have
my
father
s
complete
confidence
if
father
have
a
poor
aunt
he
be
send
money
to
phillips
knew
all
about
that
aunt
where
to
send
the
money
how
much
and
so
on
phillips
be
on
his
way
to
make
a
large
fortune
in
ibm
stock
but
he
never
own
a
car
until
when
he
decide
to
get
one
he
go
to
dad
and
say
mr
watson
i
have
enough
money
to
buy
a
car
but
i
would
like
your
permission
before
i
do
it
dad
use
to
make
phillips
take
me
sightsee
to
the
statue
of
liberty
to
fraunces
tavern
to
the
brooklyn
bridge
as
soon
as
i
be
old
enough
phillips
taught
me
how
to
shoot
hunt
be
possibly
the
only
enjoyment
phillips
get
out
of
life
and
we
go
shoot
together
until
he
die
most
of
the
time
my
father
praise
me
tell
me
what
a
great
fellow
i
be
go
to
be
but
as
i
look
back
i
think
he
must
have
be
awfully
worried
around
the
time
i
be
thirteen
i
begin
to
suffer
recur
depression
so
deep
that
no
one
knew
where
they
be
go
to
lead
the
first
one
start
with
an
attack
of
asthma
just
as
i
be
begin
to
feel
a
little
well
all
my
willpower
seem
to
evaporate
i
didn
t
want
to
get
out
of
bed
i
have
to
be
urge
to
eat
i
have
to
be
urge
to
take
a
bath
such
behavior
today
would
probably
be
see
as
a
symptom
of
clinical
depression
a
serious
mood
disorder
that
cause
a
lot
of
suicide
but
at
the
time
my
parent
have
all
sort
of
doctor
in
to
see
me
and
no
one
knew
what
the
problem
be
the
best
doctor
we
have
say
he
be
sure
the
trouble
be
connect
to
my
be
an
adolescent
but
he
didn
t
know
what
to
prescribe
after
about
thirty
day
i
recover
but
six
month
later
the
same
thing
happen
for
the
next
six
year
until
i
be
nineteen
and
start
college
twice
a
year
i
d
be
severely
depressed
unless
you
ve
have
such
a
depression
you
can
t
imagine
what
you
go
through
the
fear
be
totally
irrational
your
whole
think
process
go
awry
and
everything
you
see
seem
unreal
i
would
look
for
instance
at
a
knot
in
a
ceiling
beam
for
some
reason
i
d
tell
myself
that
s
a
plain
board
there
be
no
knot
in
that
beam
i
m
go
crazy
i
see
a
knot
then
i
d
slip
from
that
stage
of
think
i
be
go
crazy
to
a
stage
where
i
didn
t
know
what
be
go
on
around
me
i
couldn
t
read
a
book
and
couldn
t
talk
to
anybody
when
the
doctor
come
i
would
give
him
one
word
answer
mother
have
the
idea
that
if
she
get
me
to
exercise
i
d
come
out
of
it
so
she
bought
me
a
medicine
ball
i
remember
force
myself
out
onto
the
driveway
have
peculiar
thought
and
want
to
lie
down
meanwhile
the
chauffeur
would
be
throw
me
this
ball
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
nothing
help
and
i
be
afraid
i
d
never
feel
right
again
these
time
must
have
be
rough
on
my
family
especially
my
brother
dick
he
look
up
to
me
and
i
m
sure
it
be
confuse
to
see
me
become
suddenly
helpless
i
get
horribly
depressed
at
a
camp
in
nova
scotia
where
he
and
i
both
go
one
summer
i
be
barely
function
get
up
for
camp
activity
but
go
back
to
my
bunk
as
often
as
possible
dick
be
only
about
nine
but
i
felt
so
lonely
and
desperate
that
i
finally
take
him
aside
and
try
to
tell
him
what
i
be
go
through
i
say
stick
around
help
me
and
if
i
die
be
sure
to
tell
mother
and
dad
that
it
s
not
their
fault
the
crash
of
the
stock
market
when
i
be
fifteen
seem
to
fit
right
in
with
my
periodic
feeling
of
gloom
two
short
hill
men
commit
suicide
and
the
community
be
pretty
shaken
father
s
own
fortune
be
hurt
too
of
course
but
he
manage
to
keep
the
damage
on
paper
after
the
suicide
he
make
a
gesture
that
i
still
admire
today
he
take
over
the
school
bill
for
the
dead
men
s
child
when
the
depression
really
begin
to
bite
in
and
ibm
s
stock
slump
the
company
s
profit
stayed
quite
high
so
do
dad
s
income
since
it
be
pegged
to
the
profit
word
that
he
be
still
solvent
get
around
and
neighbor
would
come
at
night
to
ask
if
he
would
lend
money
i
suppose
he
give
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
to
people
who
be
caught
short
he
never
turn
anybody
away
even
those
he
didn
t
know
well
i
think
it
bother
him
that
several
people
in
short
hill
never
paid
him
back
after
they
have
money
again
like
many
businessmen
dad
thought
the
downturn
be
temporary
he
would
have
applaud
if
he
have
be
present
when
president
hoover
declare
a
few
week
after
the
crash
any
lack
of
confidence
in
the
economic
future
or
the
strength
of
business
in
the
united
state
be
foolish
dad
believe
that
renew
prosperity
be
just
around
the
corner
and
his
answer
to
the
depression
be
to
expand
production
in
hard
time
he
saw
opportunity
when
there
weren
t
enough
sale
to
keep
the
factory
occupy
he
order
the
warehouse
fill
with
spare
part
to
be
ready
when
demand
picked
up
he
urge
the
sale
force
to
sell
harder
and
he
hire
more
salesman
year
later
he
love
to
tell
about
visit
an
art
gallery

chief
competitor
in
the
tabulate
machine
business
this
be
in
the
very
depth
of
the
depression
and
rand
must
have
thought
dad
be
lose
his
grip
he
say
to
my
father
well

about

sometimes
he
would
bring
up
my
bad
grade
he
d
say
i
wish
you
be
well
in

i
m
sure

at
some
point
something
will
catch
hold
and
you
be
go
to
be
a
great
man
i
always
thought
that
s
impossible
dad

more
and
more
tolerant
of
the
scrape
i
d
get
into
not
long
after
i
start
at
carteret
i
team
up
with
another
boy
and
secretly
bought
a
model
t
from
a
schoolmate
neither
of
us
be
old
enough
to
drive
and
i
don
t
know
how
we
get
the
license

be
drive
around
short
hill
one
day
when
father
come
home
from
work
unexpectedly
and
caught
us
with
the
car
we
saw
him
come
and
try
to
sneak
away
by
cut
across
a
neighbor
s
field
but
dad
saw
us
and
flag
us
down
very
interest
car
he
say
walk
all
around
it
i
use
to
have
trouble
with
these
car
but
very
interest
do
you
own
this
car
my
friend
start
to
say
well
not
exactly
mr
watson
but
we
finally
admit
we
do
he
ask
where
we
kept
it
and
we
say
in
the
backyard
of
carteret
well
if
i
be
you
he
say
i
d
take
it
back
there
and
sell
it
or
get
rid
of
it
that
car
will
get
you
in
trouble
he
could
have
make
a
big
to
do
but
he
didn
t
and
we
sell
the
car
a
few
day
later
it
be
a
big
event
when
dad
let
me
transfer
to
boarding
school
i
spent
a
year
at
a
place
call
morristown
and
then
move
on
to
the
hun
school
in
princeton
i
want
to
be
a
princeton
man
and
by
go
to
hun
which
have
close
tie
to
the
university
i
figure
i
be
as
good
as
in
hun
be
fill
with
playboy
i
d
see
them
with
the
hip
flask
the
raccoon
coat
the
babe
on
their
arm
drive
the
stutz
bearcat
roadster
like
hell
down
the
street
it
be
a
style
of
life
for
which
i
felt
to
some
degree
qualify
it
meant
that
study
be
not
particularly
important
that
you
have
a
little
more
money
than
the
average
fellow
that
you
be
always
out
with
the
girl
and
that
you
own
a
car
mine
be
a
really
hot
look
black
and
red
chrysler
that
i
get
on
my
seventeenth
birthday
prohibition
be
still
on
speakeasy
didn
t
monitor
the
age
of
their
customer
much
and
i
use
to
take
girl
dance
at
the
blue
hill
plantation
outside
of
short
hill
my
luck
with
girl
be
at
best
uneven
part
of
my
trouble
might
have
be
that
i
didn
t
drink
which
be
another
sign
of
dad
s
influence
i
do
try
marijuana
once
however
in
those
day
nobody
knew
much
about
drug
although
people
do
say
that
the
black
band
played
wonderful
jazz
because
they
smoke
a
kind
of
cigarette
call
reefer
these
supposedly
stretch
out
time
so
much
that
the
musician
could
play
eighth
note
instead
of
quarter
note
a
racy
guy
at
hun
by
the
name
of
moore
come
around
with
a
couple
of
reefer
for
sale
i
bought
them
with
another
guy
name
tom
today
he
s
a
pretty
staid
fellow
around
new
york
and
i
never
greet
him
without
say
remember
the
time
we
smoke
marijuana
cigarette
it
really
irritates
him
we
lock
ourselves
in
tom
s
room
and
each
smoke
a
whole
reefer
at
the
end
i
honestly
felt
no
different
from
when
i
start
neither
do
tom
i
look
at
him
and
say
i
don
t
feel
any
different
at
all
do
you
and
he
say
not
at
all
then
he
begin
to
laugh
i
begin
laugh
too
it
be
uncontrollable
laughter
and
we
both
realize
this
be
abnormal
as
hell
we
thought
we
d
walk
it
off
so
we
go
out
in
the
hall
i
remember
feel
so
tall
that
it
be
hard
to
keep
my
balance
and
i
ran
into
a
wall
we
be
so
afraid
we
d
get
caught
in
this
condition
that
we
decide
it
would
be
prudent
to
sleep
the
drug
off
and
that
s
what
we
do
my
performance
at
hun
be
no
more
impressive
than
at
my
first
two
high
school
academically
i
be
still
a
zero
but
i
have
one
great
success
the
first
of
my
entire
life
the
day
i
arrive
at
hun
a
fellow
told
me
we
ve
get
a
crew
here
they
use
the
princeton
boathouse
row
out
of
the
princeton
boathouse
seem
excite
to
me
as
soon
as
i
get
down
there
and
make
the
first
crew
thing
start
to
pick
up
row
in
a
crew
be
a
pretty
simple
motion
i
wasn
t
good
at
throw
or
hit
but
this
involve
push
hard
with
the
leg
i
ve
get
strong
leg
and
pull
hard
with
the
arm

get
you
out
on
the
water
and
i
love
water
i
be
mad
for
that
sport
and
all
the
next
year
work
hard
at
it
the
crew
during
my
final
year
be
good
enough
to
qualify
for
the
international
regatta
in
henley
england
we
get
our
parent
to
put
up
a
couple
of
thousand
dollar
a
round
trip
steerage
ticket
in
those
day
cost
only
one
hundred
dollar
and
the
whole
crew
go
over
while
i
be
engross
in
crew
dad
and
his
friend
be
try
hard
to
get
me
accepted
to
princeton
i
have
take
the
college
admission
test
a
year
before
and
get
very
uneven
score
i
be
at
or
below
the
passing
level
in
most
subject
but
have
the
high
mark
in
new
jersey
in
physic
i
love
the
subject
my
teacher
give
vivid
demonstration
on
such
thing
as
how
pulley
make
lift
easy
when
the
result
come
in
this
teacher
say
to
me
you
re
a
funny
guy
most
of
your
mark
be
lousy
so
how
do
you
score
so
well
in
this
i
couldn
t
explain
it
i
just
have
a
sense
of
why
mechanical
thing
do
what
they
do
the
man
to
whom
dad
turn
for
leverage
be
benjamin
wood
a
professor
of
educational
research
at
columbia
university
wood
be
a
strange
genius
a
self
educate
texan
who
be
the
pioneer
of
standardize
college
entry
test
he
and
dad
discover
each
other
in
the
s
when
wood
be
desperately
look
for
a
machine
that
could
help
score
and
process
hundred
of
thousand
of
test
as
soon
as
dad
heard
what
wood
have
to
say
he
supply
columbia
with
free
equipment
by
the
truckload
wood
believe
that
anything
of
value
could
be
quantify
and
that
number
be
go
to
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
civilization
music
to
the
ear
of
a
tabulate
machine
maker
it
be
ironic
that
the
great
advocate
of
quantitative
test
should
be
call
upon
to
write
a
recommendation
for
somebody
with
grade
and
test
score
like
mine
i
barely
knew
wood
but
i
think
i
would
have
like
him
his
letter
to
dean
radcliffe
heermance
the
princeton
director
of
admission
be
very
dignify
and
at
the
same
time
warm
and
generous
here
be
how
he
tackle
the
question
of
my
grade
in
mind
and
character
i
do
not
hesitate
to
place
him
in
the
high
ten
per
cent
of
secondary
school
graduate
i
be
not
acquaint
with
his
high
school
record
but
my
inference
would
be
that
his
strictly
academic
record
would
not
adequately
indicate
his
real
mental
capacity
and
intellectual
originality
and
persistence
his
be
the
type
of
mind
that
in
my
experience
would
not
be
adequately
or
justly
measure
by
the
ordinary
test
and
examination
use
for
college
entrance
regardless
of
how
high
or
low
his
mark
may
be
the
letter
didn
t
work
but
it
must
have
gratify
my
father
because
a
copy
of
it
be
still
among
his
paper
when
he
die
dad
go
personally
to
plead
my
case
with
dean
heermance
during
my
final
spring
at
hun
when
he
come
back
all
he
say
be
that
it
wasn
t
likely
that
i
d
get
in
not
until
year
later
do
he
tell
me
what
happen
at
that
meeting
the
dean
laid
my
record
from
morristown
and
hun
on
the
desk
and
say
to
father
mr
watson
i
be
look
at
your
son
s
record
and
he
be
a
predetermine
failure
not
know
this
i
be
everlastingly
hopeful
i
told
my
father
that
my
final
grade
from
hun
would
show
great
improvement
when
i
get
back
from
henley
i
join
dad
and
the
rest
of
our
family
at
the
big
summerhouse
he
own
by
then
in
camden
maine
my
mark
be
wait
for
me
i
still
have
them
somewhere
a
couple
of
them
be
good
and
three
be
bad
finally
i
have
to
admit
that
my
chance
for
college
that
fall
seem
pretty
slim
two
morning
later
dad
have
his
big
packard
tour

disaster
mr

day
when

rundown
and
a
good
number
of
student
seem
undernourished
many
of
them
commute
by
bus
from
place
like
pawtucket
because
they
couldn
t
afford
to
live
at
school
however
i
fell
in
with
the
minority
of
student
who
have
the
money
to
behave
as
if
the
s
have
never

living
this
way
i
be
even
more
at
odds
with
myself
than
most
aimless
undergraduate
i
be
behaving
like
a
playboy
but
i
could
see
that
the
country
be
in
an
economic
mess
i
felt
anxious
to
make
something
of
myself
yet
unable
to
lift
a
finger
to
try
i
be
a

slogan

really
rich
i
have
a
trust
fund

naturally
of

each
year
his
accountant
would
come
around
and
have
me
sign
income
tax
form
that

blank
he
d
make
an
excuse
that
he

yet
to
fill
them
out
this
kept
up
not

one

me
dad
however
put
virtually
no
pressure
on
me
to

good
at

good
i
plow

after
that
he
and
the

grow
quite
friendly
once
or
twice
a
month
dad
would
send
him
suggestion
sometimes
solicit
sometimes
not
at
time
roosevelt
s
men
would
even
ask

appointment
schedule
in
case

roosevelt
write
back

father
be
so
proud
of

flatter
by
that

in
when
the

release
a
list
of
the
lead

and
the
last
of
the
robber
baron
dad
get
really
upset
at
that
he
felt
his
salary
reflect
the
value
he
be
generate
for
ibm
s
stockholder
in
fact
the
company
be
do
so
well
that
every
few
year
dad
make
a
point
of
have
the
board
adjust
his
percentage
of
the
profit
downward
so
that
his
pay
do
not
become
even
more
spectacular
be
the
son
of
the
thousand
dollar
a
day
man
didn
t
bother
me
at
all
i
be
still
try
to
get
over
isabel
and
when
the
story
about
dad
appear
a
lot
of
girl
suddenly
found
me
more
interest
than
before
from
my
vantage
point
both
roosevelt
and
the
depression
seem
remote
except
for
tell
me
over
and
over
that
roosevelt
be
a
hero
dad
rarely
discuss
politics
with
me
but
his
liberal
principle
gradually
rubbed
off
and
i
begin
to
develop
a
sense
of
social
justice
the
more
i
thought
about
the
federal
relief
program
the
well
they
struck
me
by
i
be
get
into
argument
with
member
of
my
fraternity
who
want
alf
landon
for
president
then
at
the
begin
of
roosevelt
s
second
term
i
go
to
cuba
with
some
of
my
fraternity
brother
for
spring
vacation
we
take
a
cruise
ship
from
new
york
and
have
a
tremendous
time
havana
offer
every
kind
of
vice
and
if
you
want
to
raise
hell
that
be
the
place
to
do
it
but
when
i
get
home
i
begin
think
it
be
awful
for
the
cuban
to
have
their
country
turn
into
an
amusement
park
for
rich
american
new
deal
value
weren
t
the
only
thing
i
picked
up
from
dad
somehow
through
his
moralize
his
example
and
his
impressive
tolerance
for
my
misbehavior
the
old
gentleman
get
to
me
sometime
around
my
sophomore
year
at

start
learn
how
to
police
myself
my
roommate
that
year

an
interest
fellow
from
pittsburgh

a
very
wealthy
father

and
stay
out
late
with
every
girl
in
town
iggy

t

a
damn

didn
t
mind
if
he
flunk
out
at
any
rate
iggy
be
wild
he
have
a
great
dane
that
he
didn
t
want
to
bother

so
he
bought
a
meal
ticket
from
the
greasy
spoon
cafeteria
at
the
end
of
the
block
and
tie
it
under
the
dog
s
collar
whenever
the
dog
be
hungry
it
would
trot
down
to
the
cafeteria
and
paw
the
door
somebody
would
feed
the
dog
a
hamburger
and
punch
the
ticket
for
two
bit
that
cause
quite
a
stir
in
the
neighborhood
some
people
say
the
meal
ticket
ought
to
be
take
from
the
dog
and
give
to
a
poor
student
toward

middle
of

another
of
my
visit

to
flunk

that
january

a
single
room
in
a
dormitory
and

try
hard
but
exam

and
i
knew
i
would
flunk

i
developed
a
pain
in
my
right
side
that
turn
out
to
be
appendicitis
get
operate
on
give
me
a
chance
to
postpone
take
the
exam
by
six
week
so
i
be
able
to
study
and
pas
during
that
same
period
i
wrestle
with
the
question
of
alcohol
drinking
be
a
charge
subject
in
our
family
go
back
to
when
my
parent
first
met
by
not
touch
their
wine
dad
never
serve
liquor
in
the
house
during
prohibition
and
his
attitude
make
drinking
seem
sinful
he
avoid
alcohol
like
he
avoid
airplane
once
mother
be
try
to
give
him
a
dose
of
castor
oil
she
have
a
way
of
make
it
less
revolt
by
mix
it
with
soda
lemon
juice
and
whiskey
dad
get
the
stuff
right
up
to
his
mouth
then
put
it
down
on
the
basin
and
say
i
d
rather
not
do
that
jeannette
he
wash
the
glass
out
pour
in
straight
castor
oil
and
drank
it
down
at
ibm
drinking
be
taboo
and
the
repeal
of
prohibition
in
december
make
no
difference
at
all
the
official
policy
be
that
employee
do
not
drink
during
the
workday
and
that
no
liquor
be
allow
at
ibm
gathering
or
on
ibm
property
the
unofficial
policy
be
that
excessive
drinking
even
do
on
your
own
time
could
ruin
your
chance
of
promotion
in
endicott
our
factory
town
the
say
be
that
a
prudent
ibm
man
would
draw
his
shade
before
have
a
cocktail
with
his
wife
father
do
nothing
to
dispel
this
myth
although
i
don
t
think
he
ever
meant
to
intrude
on
people
s
private
life
he
just
want
ibm
to
be
beyond
reproach
but
his
subordinate
conclude
he
be
averse
to
all
merrymaking
and
they
sometimes
get
carry
away
in
press
that
view
on
the
employee
it
s
not
surprising
that
i
prefer
spending
the
holiday
away
from
home
while
i
be
in
college
i
d
go
home
for
christmas
day
then
the
rest
of
the
time
i
d
visit
my
fraternity
brother
and
their
family
one
night
just
before
new
year
s
of
some
of
us
be
drinking
beer
at
a
country
club
in
scranton
pennsylvania
i
be
twenty
year
old
one
glass
lead
to
another
and
the
drink
seem
to
improve
my
dance
so
i
have
a
marvelous
even
the
next
day
i
have
a
crisis
of
conscience
on
my
way
back
to
new
york
i
begin
agonize
over
my
gaiety
and
my
father
s
feeling
about
alcohol
i
felt
so
guilty
that
i
decide
to
confess
to
dad
later
that
day
i
take
some
difficult
step
into
the
library
of
our
apartment
where
he
be
sit
dad
i
say
i
want
to
talk
about
something
i
outline
the
previous
even
which
hadn
t
really
be
anything
more
than
a
few
beer
and
a
lot
of
fun
dad
must
have
found
my
confession
very
reassure
he
shook
my
hand
and
say
thank
you
very
much
for
tell
me
son
can
you
sit
down
for
a
few
minute
then
he
say
i
try
a
few
beer
when
i
be
young
and
a
few
beer
lead
to
strong
stuff
and
it
never
really
work
out
for
me
later
i
heard
a
story
that
to
my
knowledge
he
never
told
anyone
not
even
my
mother
it
come
from
an
old
friend
of
his
when
dad
have
go
to
buffalo
at
age
nineteen
to
seek
his
fortune
his
first
job
have
be
like
the
one
he
d
left
behind
in
paint
post
sell
sew
machine
off
the
back
of
a
wagon
this
time
for
a
manufacturer
call
wheeler
and
wilcox
one
day
dad
go
into
a
roadside
saloon
to
celebrate
a
sale
and
have
too
much
to
drink
when
the
bar
close
he
found
out
that
his
entire
rig
horse
buggy
and
sample
have
be
steal
wheeler
and
wilcox
fire
him
and
dun
him
for
the
lose
property
word
of
this
get
around
of
course
and
it
take
dad
more
than
a
year
to
find
another
steady
job
this
anecdote
never
make
it
into
ibm
lore
which
be
too
bad
because
it
would
have
help
explain
father
to
the
ten
of
thousand
of
people
who
have
to
follow
his
rule
at
the
time
he
must
have
felt
as
though
his
life
be
over
i
don
t
know
how
much
dad
drank
up
until
then
but
lose
his
wagon
and
his
sew
machine
be
enough
to
put
him
off
liquor
for
the
rest
of
his
life
my
father
begin
to
exercise
a
profound
influence
on
me
something
like
the
way
religion
affect
some
people
i
d
go
out
night
after
night
with
pretty
girl
dance
and
have
some
drink
but
after
about
a
week
of
this
i
d
start
to
sense
him
maybe
he
be
four
thousand
mile
away
but
i
d
feel
him
like
the
keel
of
a
boat
pull
me
back
upright
again
i
never
exactly
rush
back
to
my
room
to
start
study
but
i
d
take
a
new
tack
of
try
to
live
well
my
poor
performance
at
school
make
it
hard
for
me
to
see
what
i
be
go
to
amount
to
but
gradually
i
reach
the
conclusion
that
i
might
do
all
right
if
i
work
the
whole
spectrum
of
thing
i
be
reasonably
good
at
mainly
have
to
do
with
people
i
knew
how
to
turn
down
a
drink
how
to
keep
myself
well
turn
out
how
to
show
respect
toward
old
people
to
some
degree
i
be
copying
dad
he
wasn
t
well
educate
but
he
have
assimilate
enough
knowledge
of
the
world
that
his
lack
of
formal
learn
be
never
a
handicap
so
i
begin
to
work
hard
at
make
and
keep
friend
i
learn
to
focus
on
the
other
person
during
a
conversation
and
to
ask
myself
constantly
be
i
out
of
line
with
this
fellow
be
i
do
right
by
him
or
be
i
offend
in
some
way
the
friend
i
make
in
college
be
still
my
friend
today
when
senior
year
roll
around
i
flirt
with
the
idea
of
drop
out
of
school
to
fool
with
airplane
full
time
a
friend
and
i
have
a
little
aerial
photography
business
but
i
be
afraid
of
what
might
happen
to
me
if
i
go
entirely
out
on
my
own
and
i
say
to
myself
i
ve
already
put
in
three
year
i
might
as
well
graduate
i
take
all
the
gut
course
i
could

the
time

how
young

but
mother
have

shock
to
protect
the

mr
wertheim
have
transfer
ownership
to
his
wife
who
be
a
certify
aryan
but
they
fear
for
their
future
and
decide
to
get
out
the
fact
that
this
family
felt
force
to
abandon
a
great
business
because
of

be
incomprehensible
to

nothing
put
all
their
possession
in
six
railroad
car
pay
everybody
off
and
take
the
train
into
sweden
i
remember
walk
down
unter
den
linden
the
city
s
main
avenue
with
a
manager
from
ibm
s
local
office
we
pass
the
reichschancellery
building
and
i
saw
soldier
in
uniform
and
helmet
a
little
far
on
i
spot
the
office
of
intourist
the
russian
travel
agency
i
need
some
information
in
connection
with
my
trip
east
so
i
walk
in
the
ibm
man
follow
me
absentmindedly
but
when
he
look
around
and
realize
where
he
be
he
dash
back
out
the
door
there
be
a
lot
of
animosity
between
the
german
and
the
russian
and
he
didn
t
want
to
risk
be
see
there
i
also
visit
the
japanese
embassy
where
houston
take
me
to
a
reception
it
be
a
beautiful
house
and
we
stood
in
the
garden
sip
tea
while
a
german
diplomat
told
us
proudly
that
the
place
have
belong
to
a
rich
jew
who
have
flee
the
country
nobody
take
exception
but
i
wonder
how
the
jewish
man
felt
about
have
his
house
take
over
the
callousness
of
the
german
make
me
very
uneasy
dad
s
optimism
blind
him
to
what
be
go
on
in
germany
even
though
the
german
welcome
the
congress
they
didn
t
like
the
idea
of
increase
trade
they
kept
insist
that
too
much
international
commerce
would
ruin
their
self
sufficiency
which
they
need
in
case
of
war
but
dad
believe
his
german
businessmen
friend
who
assure
him
they
have
hitler
in
check
a
lot
of
people
make
the
same
mistake
but
not
everyone
have
a
chance
to
ask
adolf
hitler
point
blank
what
he
have
in
mind
on
the
third
day
of
the
congress
my
father
have
a
private
meeting
with
hitler
and
hitler
fool
him
completely
when
dad

to
reporter
afterward
he
praise
hitler
s
sincerity
accord
to
dad
hitler
say
there
will
be
no

no
country
want
war
and
no
country
can
afford
it
at
the
end
of
the

truly
thomas
j
watson
my
father
somehow
found
time
in
berlin
to
give
me
advice
about
my
trip
to
the
far
east
we
both
thought
of
this
as
my
first
exposure
to
the
real
world
and
he
must
have
be
worried
that
i
d
fall
right
into
the
fleshpots
of
the
orient
he
warn
me
not
to
fool
around
with
woman
of
other
nationality
because
cultural
difference
make
it
hard
to
distinguish
between
well
breed
woman
and
those
less
well
breed
though
dad
never
talk
about
sex
he
found
an
indirect
way
to
mention
that
too
he
say
tom
you
re
go
into
very
unusual
territory
there
be
all
sort
of
disease
out
there
if
i
be
you
i
d
be
very
careful
to
always
use
a
clean
towel
if
you
cut
yourself
shave
or
something
and
you
use
a
towel
that
isn
t
absolutely
clean
you
can
get
a
serious
infection
we
say
good
bye
on
july
and
when
i
step
off
the
train
with
herbert
houston
in
warsaw
the
follow
morning
it
felt
like
my
personal
independence
day
here
i
be
twenty
three
year
old
know
nothing
about
the
world
absolutely
on
my
own

the
next
ten
week
i
intend
to
prove
myself
the
world

start
sell
pavilion

soon
as
we
reach
manchuria
which
in
those
day
be
a
puppet
state
control
by
japan
i
like
houston
at
first
because
he
d
picked
me
for
the
job
but
we
never
grow
close
he
be
in
his
sixty
like
dad
yet
he
already
seem
to
be
an
old
man
very
formal
hard
of
hearing
and
constantly
nod
off
he
knew
a
lot
of
important
people
in
the
far
east
and
have
make
his

border
we
have
to
change
train
and
the
guard
look
through
everything
we
have
as
i
soon
found
out
russia
be
in
upheaval
under
stalin
people
be
be
execute
left
and
right
or
simply
drop
out
of
the

there
be
news

about
a
field

and
fourteen
top
army
officer
accuse
of
spy
they
have
be
found
guilty
in
eight
hour
of
secret
trial
and
immediately
shot
among
people
who
knew
the
country
the
assumption
be
that
a
great
many
other
people
be
die
as
well
although
no
one
guess
the
extent
of
stalin
s
purge
unlike
many
american
who
make
pilgrimage
to
russia
in
the
s
i
felt
no
special
sympathy
for
communism
i
be
just
passing
through
on
my
way
to
tokyo
but
the
russian
revolution
be
only
twenty
year
old
and
i
be
curious
to
see
for
myself
whether
the
new
system
be
work
i
thought
about
this
on
the
train
while
houston
doze
it
bother
me
that
back
home
even
talk
about
communism
be
become
an
act
of
heresy
why
wouldn
t
sensible
people
be
willing
to
talk
about
any
approach
to
distribute
the
wealth
in
fact
the
way
money
be
distribute
in
america
didn
t
seem
entirely
fair
mother
have
always
told
us
your
father
work
hard
and
that
s
why
he
s
a
success
but
i
could
think
of
other
people
who
work
just
as
hard
and
get
nowhere
perhaps
some
other
system
might
be
well
i
be
prepared
to
believe
there
might
be
some
good
in
communism
when
we
pull
into
moscow
a
man
from
intourist
met
us
at
the
station
and
drove
us
to
the
metropole
hotel
moscow
s
fine
the
place
be
badly
run
down
and
i
be
fascinate
to
learn
that
many
room
be
occupy
by
the
piecework
champion
from
local
factory
i
wonder
what
reward
top
achiever
have
to
do
with
lenin
s
slogan
from
each
accord
to
his

manage
vast
quantity
of
statistic
for
their
five
year

schwerdt

careful
here

in
he
told
me
that
moscow
be
in
a
state
of
terror
even
though
none
of
the
russian
mention
it
for
fear
of
be

have
establish
his
power
through
execution
right
from
the
begin
and
then

put
it
in
sale

he
steadily
increase
his
quota
until
shoot
have
become
as
common
in
russia
as
traffic
ticket
in
the
u
s
a
i
sat
for
two
hour
hearing
about
propaganda
spy
the
black
market
the
terrible
housing
shortage
and
the
bureaucracy
that
paralyze
everything
by
the
time
i
left
i
be
shock
at
the
u
s
embassy
they
welcome
houston
and
me
when
we
show
them
our
letter
of
introduction
from
secretary
of
state
cordell
hull
a
friend
of
dad
s
everybody
i
met
on
the
embassy
staff
damn
the
russian
to
some
degree
the
man
who
make
the
deepest
impression
on
me
be
second
secretary
george
kennan
he
be
a
thin
intense
dark
haired
fellow
only
thirty
three
he
described
russia
as
a
dictatorship
with
a
communist
fa
ade
and
told
me
that
he
have
come
to
russia
think
that
communism
be
the
world
s
ultimate
solution
and
have
slowly
reach
the
view
that
it
be
an
utter
failure
as
it
be
be
practice
after
a
day
or
two
i
write
my
father
a
letter
say
russia
be
a
terrible
place
when
he
get
it
i
think
he
be
frantic
that
i
would
shoot
my
mouth
off
and
get
into
trouble
somehow
he
get
a
reply
to
me
within
three
day
it
say
simply
i
be
sure
that
you
will
find
condition
in
russia
much
improve
for
the
mass
as
compare
with
pre
war
time
furthermore
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
every
country
be
in
a
position
to
figure
out
what
be
best
for
its
own
people
it
be
not
our
duty
to
either
criticize
or
advise
them
in
these
matter
i
get
the
hint
and
tone
down
my
criticism
of
the
soviet
government
as
long
as
i
be
there
the
intourist
people
work
hard
to
put
a
good
face
on
thing
we
make
a
two
day
trip
to
leningrad
where
they
show
us
the
art
treasure
the
czar
have
hoard
and
the
palace
they
have
built
while
ordinary
russian
suffer
to
give
us
an
idea
of
the
ideal
communist
state
intourist
take
us
on
a
bus
to
a
collective
farm
outside
moscow
it
look
more
or
less
like
an
ordinary
u
s
farm
but
what
do
impress
me
be
the
way
they
care
for
the
child
in
clean
bright
nursery
i
annoyed
my
guide
by
pay
more
attention
to
the
kid
than
the
farm
when
i
offer
money
to
one
little
boy
the
guide
say
angrily
they
don
t
want
money
they
have
plenty
nonetheless
i
give
the
boy
some
in
secret
and
he
leap
at
it
while
we
be
in
moscow
i
be
surprised
at
how
little
houston
ask
me
to
do
even
though
he
be
spending
a
lot
of
time
at
the
japanese
embassy
make
plan
for
our
trip
east
after
about
a
week
he
stun
me
by
say
that
we
be
go
to
wait
for
another
man
my
age
to
join
us
this
be
peter
weil
nephew
of
a
prominent
new
york
investment
banker
when
i
ask
why
he
be
come
houston
say
to
be
my
secretary
like
you
that
rile
me
because
i
didn
t
think
houston
need
two
secretary
i
press
him
until
finally
he
told
me
that
peter
weil
s
trip
be
be
paid
for
by
his
family
and
that
the
same
go
for
me
dad
have
secretly
arrange
to
reimburse
the
world
s
fair
for
my
salary
and
expense
this
be
a
terrible
blow
to
my
pride
i
would
never
have
take
the
job
if
i
have
know
that
my
father
have
create
it
i
felt
as
though
he
have
deceive
me
i
be
angry
with
myself
for
not
see
through
it
sooner
and
i
resent
houston
for
go
along
with
it
if
houston
didn
t
need
me
then
i
would
spend
the
trip
fooling
around
on
dad
s
money
just
as
i
have
do
for
four
year
at
brown
but
my
anger
and
embarrassment
weren
t
that
easy
to
shrug
off
the
next
eight
week
be
among
the
most
confuse
of
my
life
peter
weil
and
i
share
a
compartment
on
the
train
across
siberia
he
be
a
nice
enough
fellow
and
seem
perfectly
gentlemanly
we
would
play
backgammon
late
each
night
and
sleep
until
midday
by
the
time
we
get
to
manchuria
i
owe
him
about
forty
dollar
which
make
me
mad
especially
when
i
caught
him
reading
a
book
call
win
at
backgammon
he
have
hidden
in
his
luggage
i
always
kept
an
eye
on
him
after
that
although
we
continued
to
get
along
the
train
go
very
slowly
and
stop
a
lot
i
spent
long
hour
look
out
the
window
at
the
taiga
the
endless
forest
of
evergreen
and
birch
tree
my
fantasy
be
that
if
a
good
airline
could
get
a
permit
to
fly
across
that
vast
land
it
could
be
the
most
profitable
route
in
the
world
berlin
to
tokyo
in
five
day
i
felt
curious
about
the
siberian
people
and
whenever
we
stop
i
d
explore
the
little
town
and
haggle
in
the
shop
that
be
about
the
only
fun
i
have
in
six
long
day
apart
from
sing
and
talk
with
a
group
of
german
and
some
english
girl
we
discover
rid
among
the
peasant
in
third
class
cross
into
japanese
territory
from
siberia
meant
reentering
the
modern
world
with
a
jolt
to
reach
tokyo
we
have
to
cross
manchuria
travel
down
the
length
of
the
korean
peninsula
and
take
a
ferry
from
pusan
across
to
japan
i
be
amaze
at
the
work
the
japanese
have
do
all
along
the
way
in
manchuria
which
have
be
under
their
control
for
just
six
year
we
rode
on
a
first
rate
train
call
the
asia
that
be
air
condition
completely
streamline
fast
and
as
smooth
as
a
boat
on
a
calm
sea
the
only
unsettle
thing
be
that
everywhere
we
saw
evidence
of
japan
s
military
buildup
troop
and
staff
car
at
the
train
station
battleship
in
harbor
i
be
so
impressed
by
japan
s
modernity
that
i
didn
t
pay
too
much
attention
to
this
even
when
a
japanese
plainclothesman
on
one
train
claimed
we
d
take
picture
in
a
forbidden
zone
and
confiscate
our
film
but
it
be
only
a
few
day
later
that
japan
launch
the
full
scale
invasion
of
china
that
some
historian
call
the
begin
of
world
war
ii
when
we
reach
tokyo
we
set
up
shop
in
the
imperial
hotel
houston
be
hopelessly
disorganize
and
so
secretive
that
he
wouldn
t
let
peter
or
me
open
the
mail
or
even
keep
track
of
his
appointment
yet
somehow
thanks
to
his
connection
the
pavilion
space
get
sell
by
tag
along
with
him
we
met
many
prominent
japanese
include
ginjiro
fujihara
a
paper
manufacturer
who
later
become
the
minister
of
munition
he
invite
us
to
a
tea
ceremony
at
his
home
and
afterward
talk
about
the
invasion
of
china
and
how
it
might
affect
relation
with
england
and
the
u
s
fujihara
say
openly
that
japan
be
no
longer
afraid
of
england
as
she
be
a
very
old
nation
and
japan
be
a
young
one
when
houston
ask
what
about
the
united
state
fujihara
smile
and
say
we
like
president
roosevelt
s
good
neighbor
policy
i
take
that
at
face
value
it
would
have
be
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
japan
thought
of
the
u
s
as
a
rival
on
the
contrary
what
impressed
me
most
in
tokyo
be
the
extent
to
which
u
s
and
japanese
interest
seem
entwine
i
have
always
thought
of
japan
as
very
remote
but
i
kept
run
into
familiar
face
men
who
knew
my
father
recent
ivy
league
graduate
i
either
knew
or
have
heard
of
and
even
a
japanese
count
who
have
be
princeton
s
big
dandy
during
my
year
at
the
hun
school
by
this
time
i
be
consider
a
major
change
of
plan
my
ibm
training
be
due
to
start
in
the
fall
but
peter
be
make
arrangement
to
go
on
to
india
after
we
finish
in
tokyo
and
i
decide
i
want
to
go
too
i
write
to
my
father
ask
his
permission
to
extend
my
tour
his
reply
practically
scorch
the
telegraph
wire
from
standpoint
of
future
you
cannot
afford
to
consider
trip
company
rule
require
fall
school
you
would
not
want
a
special
ruling
to
cover
your
case
your
own
judgment
will
tell
you
to
return
with
mr
houston
as
plan
do
not
handicap
your
future
or
disappoint
me
dad
i
didn
t
have
the
nerve
to
challenge
him
any
far
at
least
not
directly
so
i
do
my
work
and
after
three
week
in
the
far
east
when
houston
told
us
we
d
be
free
during
our
remain
time
in
japan
i
look
for
a
way
to
end
the
trip
with
a
bang
the
japanese
have
just
capture
peking
and
i
suggest
to
peter
that
we
go
there
to
look
up
a
couple
of
english
girl
we
d
met
on
the
trans
siberian
we
talk
houston
into
help
us
arrange
official
permission
to
visit
china
for
two
week
i
don
t
think
we
really
understood
that
peking
be
a
war
zone
my
father
certainly
do
when
houston
inform
him
where
we
d
go
dad
be
furious
and
poor
houston
bore
the
brunt
of
it
our
situation
first
become
clear
to
me
when
we
get
to
the
tokyo
station
and

attract
many
westerner
include
dreg
from
nearly
every
country
at
one
dinner
party
i
found
myself
sit
with
a
debutante
from
new
york
at
one
elbow
and
a
french
heroin
addict
at
the
other
the
japanese
occupation
of
peking
hadn
t
slow
the
social
scene
at
all
one
of
the
most
popular
night
spot
be
the
rooftop
bar
at
the
grand
hotel
you
could
order
a
gin
gimlet
sit
back
and
watch
the
artillery
flash
to
the
west
of
the
city
where
the
war
be
go
on
peter
and
i
get
to
know
two
brother
name
faunstock
who
be
from
long
island
and
really
knew
their
way
around
peking
be
full
of
war
rumor
and
one
night
the
faunstocks
propose
that
we
go
and
see
for
ourselves
what
be
happen
on
the
city
s
outskirt
early
the
next
morning
they
hire
a
car
and
driver
get
a
large
american
flag
and
draped
it
over
the
hood
and
off
we
go
first
we
visit
a
place
where
two
hundred
chinese
have
be
ambush
and
massacre
by
the
japanese
two
week
before
each
side
of
the
road
be
cover
with
graf
and
the
smell
of
death
be
overpower
then
at
my
urge
we
go
to
the
airport
to
our
surprise
we
be
able
to
drive
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
field
without
be
challenged
we
watch
japanese
bomber
return
from
their
mission
the
plane
be
old
and
look
ready
to
fall
apart
i
guess
that
the
japanese
weren
t
use
their
best
equipment
for
this
war
and
i
felt
sorry
for
the
pilot
because
the
field
have
be
bombed
and
crater
in
the
runway
make
land
dangerous
i
decide
to
take
a
few
picture
and
get
out
of
the
car
with
my
camera
then
i
heard
something
go
clank
clank
behind
me
i
turn
around
a
japanese
sentry
have
just
charge
his
machine
gun
and
be
point
it
squarely
at
my
chest
up
until
then
it
have
never
occur
to
me
that
the
american
flag
be
no
guarantee
of
total
protection
the
incident
rattle
us
all
i
jumped
into
the
car
and
we
head
back
into
town
meekly
the
rest
of
my
time
in
peking
be
spent
constructively
in
the
shop

love
to
buy
thing

an
adventure
but
the
ride
out

harrow
japan
s
invasion
have
bogged
down
in
shanghai
and
the
japanese
i
met
along
the
way
be
tense
near
me
sat
two
soldier
solemnly
carry
the
ash
of
their
general
back
to
tokyo
the
custom
be
to
cremate
men
kill
in
battle
and
put
the
remains
in
a
label
box
which
be
then
carry
home
in
a
cloth
ritually
fold
to
make
a
kind
of
sling
the
box
sat
on
the
table
in
front
of
these
two
men
for
the
entire
trip
at
the
border
of
korea
an
official
insist
my
visa
wasn
t
valid
and
demand
a
hundred
dollar
when
i
refuse
to

shout
no
argument
and
call
in
two
soldier
they
come
up
and
point
bayonet
at
my
stomach
i
paid
right
away
i
be
angry
and
afraid
and
i
brood
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
decide
these
bastard
really
be
ready
to
make
war
and
it
suddenly
seem
to
me
shameful
that
the
united
state
and
great
britain
hadn
t
intervene
on
the
side
of
china
on
the
way
out
of
tientsin
i
d
see
the
navy
destroyer
u
s
s
ford
in
the
harbor
the
ship
be
there
to
pick
up
american
who
be
leave
peking
and
it
have
certainly
look
good
to
me
with
american
flag
paint
all
over
it
now
i
wish
i
d
be
aboard
when
i
get
to
ibm
s
sale
school
in
endicott
new
york
i
be
hop
that
people
would
treat
me
like
any
other
joe
blow
just
start
out
how
i
could
think
that
be
possible
i
don
t
know
dad
be
such
a
tremendous
force
in
that
town
that
as
i
walk
down
the
street
with
my
book
under
my
arm
people
would
point
and
say
mr
watson
s
son
during
the
first
week
i
cause
a
stir
by
go
into
a
bar
after
school
to
get
a
drink
the
bartender
say
doesn
t
your
father
have
a
big
policy
about
liquor
i
start
to
explain
that
the
rule
only
apply
to
drinking
on
the
job
or
on
ibm
property
but
there
be
no
point
i
stop
go
into
the
bar
after
that
and
begin
to
think
endicott
be
a
very
unpleasant
place
even
though
ibm
headquarters
be
in
manhattan
the
company

soul
be
there
in
endicott

its
punch
card
machine
show
customer
how
they
be
use
and
taught
recruit
like
me
how
to
sell
them

be
a
little
river
town
in
the
western
part
of

york
state
not

get
his
start

always
thought
of

deal
out
of
it

dad
believe
that
if
you
want
to
sell
to
a
businessman
you
have
to
look
like
one
there
be
a
big
picture
of
dad
look
watchful
on
the
wall
behind
the
lectern
the
rest
of
the
classroom
be
decorate
with
his
slogan
and
as
in
every
office
of
ibm
there
be
a
think
sign
prominently
displayed
magazine
cartoonist
use
to
make
fun
of
these
sign
and
ibm
s
critic
thought
they
be
ridiculous
how
could
anybody
really
think
in
a
company
that
be
such
a
one
man
show
but
to
everybody
inside
the
message
be
crystal
clear
you
would
sell
more
machine
and
advance
faster
if
you
use
your
head
i
use
to
marvel
at
how
willingly
new
employee
embrace
the
company
spirit
as
far
as
i
could
tell
nobody
make
fun
of
the
slogan
and
song
time
be
different
then
and
i
suppose
be
earnest
didn
t
seem
as
corny
in
as
it
do
today
and
of
course
job
be
awfully
hard
to
come
by
in
the
s
so
people
would
put
up
with
a
lot
as
for
me
i
be
pretty
use
to
the
ibm
culture
because
i
d
grown
up
at
the
source
it
only
bother
me
when
dad
let
thing
get
out
of
hand
as
in
when
he
commission
an
ibm
symphony
they
give
us
twelve
week
to
learn
everything
about
the
product
we
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
scale
or
meat
slicer
because
dad
have
sell
off
that
division
while
i
be
at
brown
in
its
place
he
have
bought
a
small
company
that
be
try
without
much
success
to
pioneer
the
electric
typewriter
we
study
those
and
the
whole
line
of
time
clock
but
the
bulk
of
our
course
work
be
on
punch
card
machine
which
be
in
great
demand
and
already
account
for
more
than
percent
of
the
revenue
of
the
company
at
first
i
be
thrill
to
get
my
hand
on
punch
card
machine
i
d
grown
up
around
those
thing
and
the
basic
concept
fire
my
imagination
just
as
it
do
dad
s
in
the
history
of
industrialization
punch
card
machine
belong
right
up
there
with
the
jacquard
loom
the
cotton
gin
and
the
locomotive
before
punch
card
accounting
and
record
keep
be
clumsy
operation
that
have
to
be
do
manually
by
clerk
punch
card
system
take
away
a
lot
of
the
drudgery
such
as
copying
ledger
entry
and
write
bill
and
they
do
the
work
cheaply
reliably
and
rapidly
this
obviously
be
the
wave
of
the
future
and
ibm
be
start
to
attract
high
caliber
people
because
the
machine
be
excite
to
work
with
my
father
always
say
that
those
punch
card
be
what
attract
him
to
ibm
when
charles
flint
approach
him
with
the
job
he
have
see
his
first
punch
card
installation
while
he
be
still
sell
cash
register
in
a
friend
of
his
be
use
hollerith
machine
at
eastman
kodak
to
keep
track
of
the
company
s
salesman
the
way
this
work
be
pretty
simple
each
time
a
sale
be
make
all
the
information
about
it
would
get
punch
onto
a
single
card
those
card
would
be
sort
and
tabulate
once
a
month
to
yield
all
sort
of
information
what
each
man
have
sell
which
product
be
sell
best
in
which
region
and
so
on
dad
use
to
make
a
wonderful
sale
talk
about
the
punch
card
concept
he
d
hold
one
up
and
say
you
can
put
a
hole
in
this
card
represent
one
dollar
a
dollar
of
sale
perhaps
or
a
dollar
you
owe
someone
from
that
point
on
you
have
a
permanent
record
it
can
never
be
erase
and
you
never
have
to
enter
it
again
it
can
be
add
subtract
and
multiply
it
can
be
file
accumulate
and
print
all
automatically
dad
believe
that
here
be
the
world
s
answer
to
problem
of
accounting
all
he
have
to
do
be
keep
develop
this
thing
and
ibm
would
revolutionize
business
whenever
someone
would
use
the
term
punch
card
he
would
say
these
be
ibm
card
punch
card
machine
have
become
pretty
sophisticated
by
the
time
i
get
to
endicott
they
could
sort
four
hundred
card
a
minute
print
out
paycheck
and
address
label
and
duplicate
at
very
high
speed
all
of
the
accounting
function
that
company
be
still
do
by
hand
i
like
the
idea
that
one
set
of
card
enable
a
customer
to
use
the
same
data
ten
or
twelve
different
way
and
i
be
pretty
sure
i
d
be
able
to
sell
that
however
i
quickly
found
out
there
be
more
to
ibm
school
than
appreciate
what
a
punch
card
be
everybody
have
to
learn
how
to
program
the
machine
to
do
specific
task
this
involve
arrange
wire
on
a
plugboard
which
look
something
like
an
old
fashion
telephone
switchboard
we
each
have
a
plugboard
to
work
with
and
it
soon
become
obvious
that
i
be
much
well
at
understand
the
potential
of
the
machine
than
at
actually
plug
them
up
after
only
two
week
i
have
to
be
assign
a
tutor
so
i
wouldn
t
fail
i
spent
many
night
with
that
guy
in
the
desert
schoolhouse
try
to
learn
to
hook
up
those
little
wire
before
long
ibm
school
felt
even
bad
to
me
than
carteret
or
hun
or
brown
not
only
be
my
performance
poor
as
usual
but
i
couldn
t
escape
be
see
as
t
j
s
son
everyone
in
the
school
be
try
to
guess
what
dad
want
do
with
me
without
any
regard
for
what
i
want
myself
the
head
of
the
school
garland
briggs
have
be
headmaster
of
the
hun
school
when
i
be
there
dad
have
picked
him
in
his
simplistic
way
because
he
need
an
educator
and
briggs
be
one
he
knew
i
always
thought
briggs
be
way
out
of
his
depth
in
that
job
he
have
the
big
idea
that
it
would
please
dad
if
i
be
elect
class
president
so
he
put
the
other
student
up
to
it
even
though
they
all
knew
i
need
tutor
to
get
by
unfortunately
for
me
i
lack
the
force
of
character
to
say
i
won
t
have
this
endicott
seem
more
and
more
bleak
the
place
didn
t
offer
much
in
the
way
of
fun
and
even
if
it
have
i
felt
oblige
to
behave
soberly
and
responsibly
usually
i
ate
with
my
classmate
at
the
hotel
if
we
go
out
it
cost
money
and
most
of
them
be
poor
besides
there
be
no
place
to
go
endicott
s
restaurant
be
work
class
italian
place
and
the
food
they

could
get

them
finally
i
stood
watch
the

and
go
resignedly
back
to
my
schoolbook
about
once
a

dare
leave
their
office
or
their

terrible
for
me
if
i
be
there
i
be
usually
bore
but
i
always
have
to
stay
to
the
end
because
he
would
feel
hurt
if
i
walk
out
there
be
no
well
way
to
learn
about

some
of
the
thing
he

he
sermonize
a
lot
about
self
improvement
as
in
his
letter
to
me
at
brown
but
he
also
told
story
to
illustrate
his
management
principle
the
most
important
story
involve
how
he
learn
to
sell
cash
register
dad
get
hire
as
a
salesman
for
the
cash
in
buffalo
new
york
in
during
his
first
couple
of
week
he
fail
to
close
a
single
sale
finally
he
report
this
to
the
branch
manager
a
tough
old
timer
name
jack
range
who
blew
up
he
lit
into
dad
so
hard
that
dad
use
to
say
he
be
just
wait
for
the
tirade
to
die
down
so
he
could
quit
but
when
range
decide
he
have
push
my
father
as
far
as
he
could
he
suddenly
turn
friendly
he
reassure
dad
and
offer
to
help
him
sell
some
cash
register
he
told
dad
i
ll
go
out
with
you
and
if
we
fall
down
we
ll
fall
down
together
they
load
a
big
fancy
machine
onto
the
wagon
and
sell
it
that
same
day
range
show
my
father
how
to
hit
the
right
note
in
talk
to
businessmen
and
how
to
improvise
on
the
can
sale
pitch
that
patterson
require
all
his
salesman
to
use
range
let
my
father
watch
him
close
several
more
sale
until
finally
dad
caught
on
my
father
carry
that
lesson
in
his
bone
he
want
his
manager
to
be
on
sale
call
with
a
guy
three
or
four
time
before
label
the
man
a
failure
and
he
believe
that
each
employee
be
entitle
to
help
from
those
above
he
would
say
a
manager
be
an
assistant
to
his
men
that
personal
relationship
between
the
individual
and
the
supervisor
become
the
ibm
equivalent
of
the
social
contract
i
never
disagreed
with
those
lesson
dad
taught
but
i
d
heard
them
all
a
hundred
time
before
generally
i
try
to
keep
my
distance
during
his
visit
although
he
never
say
anything
about
it
i
be
sure
he
be
unhappy
that
i
wasn
t
earn
top
grade
all
the
same
i
persevere
and
finally

yours
anyway
my
three
year
as
an
ibm
salesman
be
a
time
of
sicken
self
doubt
i
live
with
my
parent
during
this
entire
period
in
their
beautiful
townhouse
at

make
time
clock
so

in

the
place
would
clear
out
i
get
along
with

son
be
come
i
even
make
a

a
new
salesman

to
live
pretty
high
on

finally
he
become
a
drunk
and
the
father
have
to
fire
him
i
heard
him
out
and
say
thank
you
for

some
thought
but
now
i
d
like
to
tell
you
about
the
punch
card
method
of
accounting
he
say
aw
hell
i
m
not
interested
in
that
i
just
heard
you
be
t
j
watson
s
son
and
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
that
a
lot
of
people
in
your
shoe
fail
so
nice
to
meet
you
mr
watson
and
he
show
me
the
door
i
be
tempt
to
abandon
my
ibm
career
on
the
spot
i
have
no
idea
why
the
man
have
make
those
remark
and
when
i
told
my
father
about
the
incident
he
couldn
t
explain
it
either
he
simply
say
i
d
have
a
very
sorry
first
call
my
luck
improve
somewhat
after
that
when
i
could
catch
a
prospect
s
interest
i
found
sell
very
excite
the
first
thing
we
always
try
to
do
be
bring
the
prospect
to
a
demonstration
then
we
d
ask
if
we
could
make
a
survey
of
his
business
that
meant
go
into
his
office
and
figure
out
how
to
apply
punch
card
to
his
bookkeeping
we
d
look
for
procedure
that
be
easy
to
automate
punch
card
be
especially
good
for
handle
billing
account
receivable
and
sale
analysis
because
they
all
depend
on
the
same
data
it
be
easy
for
us
to
show
how
the
equipment
use
for
do
those
thing
would
more
than
pay
for
itself
the
cheapest
installation
we
have
be
something
call
the
international
it
include
a
card
sorter
a
keypunch
and
a
non
printing
tabulator
all
for
fifty
buck
a
month
we
could
tell
the
customer
it
s
fifty
dollar
a
month
and
it
ll
probably
replace
a
girl
you
re
pay
the
girl
ninety
dollar
if
that
whet
the
guy

out
of
pure
pragmatism
his
early
machine
broke
down
so
often
that
people
be
reluctant
to
buy
them
so
hollerith
rent
them
out
and
promise
to
keep
them
in
good
shape
when
dad
take

the
only
way

be
by
reading

very
small

to
everybody
who

an
ibm
machine
but
it
didn
t
stop
there
the
press
run
be
close
to
one
hundred
thousand
and
we
only
have
thirty
five
hundred
customer
dad
have
copy
sent

my
father
never
praise
me
for
my
work
as
a
salesman
it
be
so
easy
for
him
to
deprive
me
of
my
self
confidence
with
just
a
word
we
d
be
have
a
casual
conversation
at
home
and
he
d
say
what
do
you
think
of
the
new

you
think
of
mr
jones
no
matter
how
i
respond
he

listen
for
a
minute

with
something
terribly
cut
like

know
you
be
really
not
experienced
enough
to
have
an
opinion

have
enjoy
these
petty
emotional
exercise

stir
around

a
way

i
m
not
go
to
let
ibm
run
my
life
of
course
my
father

thing
very
differently

point
by
tell
me
another
of
his
story

involve
j
p
morgan
and
young
charles
schwab
it
be
right
after

organize
u
s
steel
and

schwab
into
take

top
job
schwab
go
to
paris
to
blow
off
steam
and
story
about
his
hell
raise
soon
filter
back
across
the
ocean
when
he
get
back
to
new
york
morgan
call
him
into
his
office
and
told
him
to
stop
act
like
a
fool
schwab
say
mr
morgan
you
re
be
unfair
you
know
perfectly
well
i
m
not
do
anything
you
don
t
do
yourself
except
that
you
do
it
behind
close
door
mr
schwab
that
be
what
door
be
for
say
morgan
in
his
own
life
dad
set
a
great
example
and
in
fact
never
have
much
to
hide
but
he
believe
that
the
business
leader
who
cover
his
imperfection
by
keep
them
private
be
well
than
the
one
who
say
this
be
how
i
be
let
it
all
hang
out
dad
probably
would
have
press
this
point
harder
if
i
d
be
really
reckless
in
the
way
i
live
but
as
much
as
i
love
a
good
time
i
kept
myself
out
of
the
gossip
column
and
be
never
involve
in
a
scandal
i
be
with
girl
constantly
but
i
avoid
the
raciest
woman
partly
because
they
scar
me
a
lot
of
cafe
society
woman
in
those
day
ran
around
with
so
many
men
that
they
have
no
idea
where
their
emotion
lay
i
d
already
be
hurt
by
one
beautiful
and
well
breed
girl
so
i
knew
that
woman
be
capable
of
inflict
great
pain
even
when
they
didn
t
mean
to
i
hate
to
think
what
might
have
happen
have
i
not
know
isabel
henry
before
be
turn
loose
in
new
york
i
never
get
truly
involve
with
anyone
until
i
met
olive
cawley
on
a
blind
date
in
early
a
schoolmate
of
mine
from
hun
set
it
up
for
the
two
of
us
to
join
him
and
his
wife
on
a
ski
weekend
they
picked
me
up
at
the
plaza
hotel
where
i
go
down
the
step
and
saw
a
little
ford
with
a
ski
rack
and
an
astonishingly
lovely
girl
in
back
vermont
be
a
six
or
seven
hour
drive
and
olive
and
i
talk
the
entire
way
she
be
such
a
beautiful
and
sunny
woman
she
come
from
a
good
family
but
didn
t
have
much
money
i
found
it
appeal
that
she
be
earn
her
own
way
and
make
her
own
decision
she
live
at
the
barbizon
hotel
and
work
as
a
model
for
the
john
robert
power
agency
which
be
the
best
in
those
day
she
have
be
on
magazine
cover
and
in
lot
of
ad
such
as
one
for
lucky
strike
that
show
a
picture
of
olive
hold
up
a
leaf
in
a
tobacco
field
her
face
be
know
when
we
be
out
together
people
would
often
stop
her
on
the
street
and
say
you
look
so
familiar
at
one
point
when
we
have
have
a
fall
out
i
found
i
couldn
t
get
her
out
of
my
mind
her
picture
be
always
in
some
magazine
to
remind
me
olive
have
a
way
of
do
small
kindness
that
reveal
her
gentle
and
give
nature
i
d
go
around
with
a
lot
of
beautiful
girl
but
none
of
them
have
the
unending
generosity
i
found
in
her
she
be
somewhat
frivolous
but
so
be
i
and
i
thought
about
her
seriously
from
the
very
start
when
my
parent
heard
from
my
sister
that
i
be
see
a
model
they
hint
that
they
thought
i
be
make
a
mistake
but
i
want
somebody
who
would
give
me
sweetness
love
and
support
and
somebody
who
wasn
t
go
to
feel
upstaged
if
i
actually
manage
to
accomplish
something
in
my
life
when
i
start
bring
olive
to
family
occasion
mother
kept
her
distance
at
first
but
father
unbent
and
welcome
her
he
could
be
very
pragmatic
about
matter
of
the
heart
the
longer
i
work
at
ibm
the
more
i
resent
my
father
for
the
cultlike
atmosphere
that
surround
him
i
d
look
at
business
machine
the
ibm
weekly
newspaper
and
there
would
be
a
big
picture
of
dad
and
a
banner
headline
announce
something
really
mundane
like
thomas
j
watson
open
new
orleans
office
the
more
successful
dad
become
the
more
people
flatter
him
and
he
soak
it
up
everything
flow
around
him
he
be
snap
out
order
and
there
be
always
a
secretary
run
behind
him
with
a
notebook
he
would
work
on
his
editorial
for
think
magazine
as
though
it
be
time
and
he
be
henry
luce
and
million
of
people
be
wait
to
hear
what
he
have
to
say
my
disdain
come
out
during
family
dinner
which
be
dominate
as
always
by
dad
when
he
held
forth
everyone
would
be
very
attentive
except
me
i
d
behave
in
the
most
sullen
and
insult
way
i
d
light
a
cigarette
slouch
in
my
chair
roll
my
eye
and
look
at
the
ceiling
olive
be
shock
by
these
antic
and
my
sister
and
brother
thought
i
be
a
nuisance
dad
never
give
any

to
me
at
the
time
that

d
go
completely
overboard
but
in
fact
ibm

be
a
public
relation
coup
on
the
first
business
day
of

felt
demean
everybody
knew
that

the
old
man
s
son
and
that
otherwise
i
never
could
have
sell
so
much
in
such
a
short
time
from
then
on
even
though
life
outside

seem
impossible
to
imagine
all
i
could
think
about
be
find
a
way
out
i
might
never
have
reach
this
turn
point
if
there
hadn
t
be
a
war
on
in
europe

seem
inevitable
that
america
be
go

want
to
be
in
the
military
fly

when
war
come
qualify
as
an
air
corp
pilot
wasn
t
as
simple
as
it
sound
to
begin
with
i
want
to
avoid
fly
school
because
i
thought
the
military
discipline
would
cause
me
to
wash
out
i
be
no
twenty
year
old
kid
i
be
twenty
six
an
experienced
pilot
and
not
about
to
trade
one
situation
in
which
i
have
to
take
a
lot
of
guff
for
another
when
i
learn
that
hap
arnold
the
command
general
of
the
u
s
army
air
corp
be
give
a
speech
to
a
young
men
s
group
in
new
york
i
go
to
ask
him
what
to
do
arnold
be
a
very
direct
and
impatient
man
at
the
start
of
the
question
and
answer
session
i
raise
my
hand
and
he
say
yup
i
say
i
have
about
a
thousand
hour
of
civilian
time
and
i
d
like
to
know
how
to
get
into
the
air
corp
without
go
to
fly
school
there
isn
t
any
way
go
to
the
fly
school
next
question
but
i
stayed
stand
and
say
but
general
it
seem
like
a
waste
of
the
government
s
money
to
get
train
all
over
again
it
s
an
entirely
different
kind
of
fly
and
your
civilian
time
be
no
good
he
just
about
order
me
to
sit
down
well
i
do
sit
down
and
say
to
myself
i
m
go
to
get
around
him
i
have
a
second
reason
for
want
to
skip
flight
school
something
be
wrong
with
my
eye
i
confirm
this
by
go
privately
to
a
doctor
who
put
me
through
the
air
corp
eye
exam
one
of
the
instrument
be
for
test
muscle
balance
when
you
look
into
it
one
eye
saw
a
dot
and
the
other
eye
saw
a
line
the
idea
be
to
superimpose
one
on
the
other
by
turn
a
knob
after
i
do
this
the
doctor
shook
his
head
you
ll
never
make
it
he
say
you
d
crash
an
airplane
right
away
you
have
absolutely
no
depth
perception
but
doctor
i
say
i
have
over
a
thousand
hour
in
the
air
and
i
ve
be
fly
for
seven
year
well
it
s
highly
dangerous
highly
dangerous
he
explain
that
i
have
extremely
unbalanced
eye
muscle
my
left
eye
look
down
and
my
right
eye
look
up
with
three
time
the
amount
of
divergence
allow
by
the
air
force
but
i
wasn
t
about
to
give
up
my
fly
career
instead
i
bought
one
of
those
test
machine
and
practice
set
those
dot
and
line
at
home
i
become
so
adept
at
it
that
once
i
make
it
into
the
air
force
i
pass
the
test
every
year
for
five
year
in
the
springtime
i
found
out
that
the
way
around
flight
school
be
to
join
the
national
guard
all
they
require
of
pilot
be
three
hundred
hour
civilian
time
and
a
flight
test
i
sign
up
right
away
and
before
the
year
be
out
i
have
my
wing
and
a
commission
as
a
second
lieutenant
in
the
nd
observation
squadron
weekday
i
d
mark
time
at
ibm
and
every
weekend
i
d
go
out
to
the
squadron
s
airfield
on
staten
island
and
practice
my
father
hardly
talk
to
me
about
the
war
but
a
couple
of
week
after
i
enlist
he
return
his
hitler
medal
i
knew
he
d
pin
an
awful
lot
on
the
idea
of
world
peace
through
world
trade
and
the
come
of
war
left
him
somewhat
mute
he
wasn
t
a
pacifist
but
he
be
very
ambivalent
about
whether
the
united
state
should
get
into
the
fight
that
be
reflect
in
the
way
he
treat
munition
work
some
company
like
north
american
aviation
have
start
shipping
warplane
abroad
even
before
hitler
invade
poland
but
dad
didn
t
like
the
idea
of
turn
endicott
into
an
arm
plant
and
he
wasn
t
happy
when
the
war
department
press
a
contract
on
ibm
in
the
autumn
of
to
manufacture
machine
gun
he
set
up
a
subsidiary
company
in
poughkeepsie
new
york
for
this
work
and
kept
that
whole
enterprise
at
arm
s
length
of
course
when
war
finally
come
ibm
go
all
out
and
dad
put
our
name
proudly
on
the
weapon
we
make
in
september
roosevelt
mobilize
the
national
guard
and
finally
i
have
what
i
want
i
be
a
full
fledge
military
pilot
my
squadron
soon
move
to
fort
mcclellan
near
anniston
alabama
for
training
anniston
make
endicott
seem
like
a
garden
spot
it
be
hot
wet
and
boring
but
i
didn
t
mind
because
i
be
free
from
ibm
be
fly
every
day
and
i
have
college
friend
in
nearby
city
to
see
on
weekend
after
have
toed
the
line
at
ibm
for
three
year
in
new
york
i
indulge
in
some
terribly
immature
behavior
i
remember
one
wild
night
in
cincinnati
in
which
i
be
the
only
man
in
uniform
at
a
dinner
party
and
it
suddenly
occur
to
me
that
all
these
people
be
fiddle
while
rome
be
burning
the
host
be
wealthy
about
my
age
and
he
have
a
marvelous
family
in
a
marvelous
house
in
a
marvelous
town
somehow
i
have
the
idea
that
he
ought
to
enlist
i
step
outside
to
get
some
air
and
notice
a
garden
hose
hooked
up
to
the
side
of
the
house
i
ve
love
hose
ever
since
i
be
little
and
this
seem
like
the
perfect
way
to
express
what
i
thought
of
these
self
satisfied
people
i
turn
it
on
go
back
into
the
din
room
and
sprayed
the
entire
dinner
party
two
big
guy
come
to
life
and
start
after
me
but
i
ran
back
out
and
dove
into
the
pool
they
d
have
thrown
me
in
anyway
for
year
after
that
people
would
come
up
to
me
and
say
aren
t
you
the
guy
that
hose
down
the
dinner
party
at
so
and
so
s
house
and
i
d
say
gee
i
don
t
think
so
on
some
level
i
think
i
must
have
understood
it
be
high
time
to
grow
up
whenever
olive
visit
for
the
weekend
my
behavior
improve
we
have
terrific
fun
together
and
i
could
sense
a
depth
of
emotion
in
her
that
more
and
more
make
me
want
to
forget
the
prank
and
get
serious
we
be
both
still
see
other
people
but
as
war
come
nearer
marriage
seem
more
and
more
appeal
i
knew
she
dream
of
start
a
family
and
the
thought
that
i
might
get
kill
make
me
want
one
too
so
in
november
i
visit
new
york
take
her
dance
on
starlight
roof
at
the
waldorf
and
ask
her
to
marry
me
i
have
a
diamond
ring
in
my
pocket
earlier
that
day
i
d
go
to
the
jeweler
harry
winston
in
my
rumple
uniform
with
a
plea
of
poverty
and
he
give
me
a
pretty
good
deal
that
be
one
big
difference
between
me
and
dad
he
d
have
take
out
a
loan
to
buy
a
nice
engagement
ring
but
i
prefer
to
take
the
cash
i
have
on
hand
and
bargain
for
one
olive
and
i
have
a
big
engagement
party
in
locust
valley
at
the
home
of
her
aunt
olive
shea
who
be
married
to
ed
shea
the
head
of
the
ethyl
corporation
we
schedule
our
wedding
for
the
day
after
christmas
i
always
thought
it
would
be
hitler
who
d
bring
us
into
the
war
but
the
japanese
beat
him
to
the
punch
i
be
in
a
car
on
my
way
back
to
the
base
with
my
squadron
mate
john
gwynne
and
his
wife
when
the
news
of
pearl
harbor
come
over
the
radio
we
thought
it
couldn
t
be
true
but
several
station
be
broadcasting
the
same
report
for
a
while
we
sat
quietly
and
finally
someone
say
this
mean
major
change
in
our
life
we
knew
we
d
never
stay
in
anniston
probably
they
d
retrain
the
squadron
and
send
us
out
to
fly
bomber
at
the
base
everyone
be
very
grim
many
people
thought
the
japanese
be
go
to
attack
the
west
coast
any
minute
within
a
week
we
get
order
transfer
the
squadron
to
california
when
i
heard
that
i
didn
t
waste
any
time
i
call
olive
and
say
you
have
to
come
down
here
so
we
can
get
married
right
away
at
first
she
cry
and
say
her
dress
wasn
t
ready
but
she
rise
to
the
occasion
she
spent
that
afternoon
in
store
and
get
on
a
train
with
her
mother
that
night
i
call
my
family
and
they
follow
the
next
day
i
ask
my
father
to
be
best
man
which
wasn
t
the
conventional
thing
to
do
i
could
have
gotten
gwynne
or
one
of
my
college
friend
but
these
be
men
he
hardly
knew
at
that
point
dad
be
very
much
on
my
mind
underneath
all
my
resentment
and
underneath
all
the
he
bore
me
he
embarrasses
me
with
his
folderol
about
ibm
day
attitude
underneath
all
that
be
a
great
love
and
respect
i
couldn
t
have
resent
him
as
much
as
i
do
unless
it
be
base
on
some
much
deeper
emotion
the
war
be
upon
us
and
i
thought
i
might
be
kill
in
that
moment
of
great
drama
i
put
all
my
resentment
aside
that
s
why
i
invite
him
to
be
my
best
man
the
only
place
for
everyone
to
stay
in
anniston
be
a
cheap
hotel
near
the
base
that
literally
have
spittoon
in
the
lobby
i
couldn
t
get
away
from
the
base
at
all
so
olive
have
to
buy
her
own
wedding
ring
at
the
post
chapel
they
be
banging
out
a
wedding
every
fifteen
minute
we
nearly
miss
our
slot
when
the
sentry
wouldn
t
let
olive
onto
the
base
i
d
forgotten
to
give
them
her
name
at
the
gate
by
the
time
she
finally
get
in
everybody
be
upset
we
rush
up
the
aisle
together
the
whole
wedding
party
in
a
bunch
and
olive
and
i
be
married
i
knew
she
be
disappointed
get
married
in
such
rough
circumstance
and
i
be
determine
that
our
honeymoon
would
show
some
imagination
even
though
i
only
have
two
day
leave
i
d
found
a
brick
cottage
in
anniston
that
have
ivy
cover
trellis
rent
it
and
stock
it
with
food
and
champagne
dad
come
through
with
one
of
his
thoughtful
gesture
there
be
no
florist
in
anniston
so
he
call
one
in
atlanta
and
when
i
carry
olive
over
the
threshold
the
cottage
be
fill
with
rose
when
you
get
married
you
wonder
how
long
it
ll
be
before
your
first
fight
everything
be
speed
up
in
our
case
so
we
only
have
to
wait
six
day
by
then
the
squadron
be
on
its
way
to
california
i
have
to
fly
and
olive
be
drive
cross
country
with
marge
duval
the
wife
of
another
lieutenant
they
go
in
the
duvals
convertible
and
i
d
hire
a
high
school
teacher
to
follow
them
with
my
car
it
be
a
slightly
use
lincoln
that
i
d
bought
from
my
command
officer
at
the
base
figure
that
car
would
soon
be
impossible
to
come
by
before
we
say
good
bye
i
give
olive
careful
instruction
there
be
three
thing
i
want
you
to
remember
don
t
speed
don
t
pick
anybody
up
and
don
t
lose
sight
of
my
car
if
it
get
smash
up
or
lose
we
can
t
replace
it
i
ll
see
you
in
california
we
be
both
pretty
independent
but
i
knew
a
lot
more
about
the
world
than
she
do
and
i
thought
i
could
save
us
trouble
by
tell
her
exactly
what
to
do
i
have
no
idea
what
i
be
get
into
right
off
the
bat
she
and
marge
found
it
hard
to
keep
the
two
car
together
go
through
town
with
stoplight
by
the
time
they
reach
texas
on
the
third
day
they
d
completely
lose
track
of
the
high
school
teacher
and
my
car
then
they
pull
up
at
a
gas
station
and
the
man
run
it
ask
would
you
mind
give
my
son
a
ride
to
the
next
town
he
have
to
catch
a
train
and
he
s
go
to
be
awol
unless
he
can
get
there
so
they
let
the
boy
climb
in
back
finally
they
start
to
speed
because
the
road
be
long
and
flat
and
they
be
worried
the
high
school
teacher
have
gotten
ahead
of
them
meanwhile
my
squadron
have
flown
only
as
far
as
midland
texas
where
we
have
to
stop
because
the
weather
ahead
be
bad
i
look
on
a
map
at
the
route
the
girl
would
take
and
thought
olive
might
come
by
here
today
so
i
get
an
old
crate
and
a
sunday
paper
and
sat
down
beside
the
highway
near
a
railroad
cross
within
an
hour
along
they
come
two
beautiful
girl
in
a
blue
convertible
with
the
top
down
i
threw
the
paper
up
in
the
air
and
yell
and
they
stop
quite
a
distance
down
the
road
because
they
d
be
go
so
fast
that
be
number
one
as
they
back
up
a
lonesome
look
private
sat
up
in
the
backseat
where
he
d
be
asleep
that
be
number
two
i
be
awfully
mad
i
ask
olive
what
he
be
do
there
and
order
the
poor
guy
out
of
the
car
suddenly
it
dawn
on
me
that
my
own
car
be
nowhere
in
sight
i
start
holler
where
s
my
car
where
s
my
car
olive
become
so
fluster
that
she
couldn
t
say
where
she
d
see
it
last
probably
she
be
think
about
divorce
in
the
midst
of
all
this
a
train
rumble
by
and
by
the
odd
coincidence
it
be
the
train
carry
our
squadron
s
enlist
men
and
ground
equipment
they
recognize
us
and
start
yell
and
hang
out
the
window
if
i
hadn
t
be
in
such
a
fury
it
would
have
be
funny
as
it
be
we
go
to
a
hotel
and
i
call
the
state
police
the
schoolteacher
have
report
in
to
them
and
of
course
the
car
be
fine
we
drank
champagne
that
night
and
i
finally
stop
be
sore
our
base
in
california
turn
out
to
be
an
unlit
unpaved
airfield
at
san
bernardino
about
fifty
mile
from
los
angeles
we
spent
christmas
there
in
tent
it
be
terribly
bleak
not
many
of
the
men
have
their
wife
nearby
luckily
olive
have
gotten
a
room
at
the
mission
inn
quite
a
nice
hotel
where
i
d
stayed
with
my
parent
long
before
on
christmas
eve
she
and
i
get
some
bourbon
and
about
ten
gallon
of
milk
and
we
go
to
the
tent
and
serve
milk
punch
to
the
whole
squadron
at
first
the
squadron
sat
on
that
field
with
no
idea
what
to
do
but
on
the
fourth
day
after
christmas
we
get
our
order
our
mission
be
to
fly
up
and
down
the
coast
look
for
japanese
submarine
the
flight
plan
never
varied
we
would
go
straight
over
los
angeles
out
to
sea
about
ten
mile
then
parallel
to
the
coast
at
four
thousand
foot
for
maximum
underwater
visibility
when
we
get
as
far
north
as
salina
we
go
inland
refuel
and
come
back
the
same
way
we
be
fly
clumsy
airplane
call
o
s
the
o
carry
a
pilot
an
observer
and
a
gunner
it
look
like
a
pregnant
animal
with
the
observer
down
in
the
belly
peer
out
of
small
window
it
have
one
caliber
machine
gun
which
we
weren
t
suppose
to
use
if
we
spot
a
submarine
because
it
would
just
scare
the
japanese
away
instead
we
be
suppose
to
orbit
the
thing
and
radio
march
field
just
east
of
los
angeles
where
they
have
load
bomber
ready
to
attack
our
airplane
be
ludicrous
for
the
job
you
need
to
be
able
to
go
slowly
and
spot
but
to
do
that
in
such
heavy
high
speed
machine
be
very
difficult
in
my
time
off
i
have
a
lot
of
fun
right
after
new
year
s
i
rent
a
little
stucco
cottage
in
town
for
olive
to
share
with
john
gwynne
s
wife
it
be
a
two
bedroom
cottage
with
cheap
rug
and
motel
furniture
and
we
share
a
bath
and
kitchenette
pretty
primitive
living
the
squadron
would
drop
in
for
party
on
the
patio
and
we
d
serve
booze
ginger
ale
and
sandwich
one
night
i
have
all
thirteen
officer
there
and
thing
be
really
hoot
when
the
police
come
and
told
us
to
quiet
down
we
start
our
excuse
by
say
well
we
re
go
off
to
war
the
cop
take
off
their
hat
and
gun
and
join
the
party
near
our
place
be
a
resort
in
the
san
bernardino
mountain
call
the
arrowhead
spring
hotel
and
on
day
off
olive
and
i
would
drive
there
i
remember
see
movie
people
like
lana
turner
we
be
order
not
to
go
more
than
thirty
mile
from
our
post
but
once
when
gwynne
and
i
have
a
twenty
four
hour
leave
the
four
of
us
go
to
los
angeles
i
guess
they
hadn
t
see
many
aviator
there
john
s
wife
cornee
be
good
look
and
so
be
olive
so
someone
take
our
picture
and
it
appear
on
page
two
of
the
los
angeles
time
luckily
nobody
picked
up
the
fact
that
we
be
off
limit
by
twenty
mile
in
the
first
two
month
of
the
war
it
look
like
the
japanese
be
overrun
the
entire
pacific
they
attack
and
conquer
hong
kong
and
capture
much
of
the
philippine
until
bataan
and
corregidor
be
all
that
be
left
far
to
the
east
they
take
over
wake
island
and
set
up
a
base
it
wasn
t
hard
to
imagine
that
california
would
be
next
but
i
don
t
think
our
squadron
sight
a
single
submarine
los
angeles
have
an
air
raid
scare
in
which
all
the
light
in
town
go
out
and
machine
gun
fire
into
the
sky
at
nothing
but
gradually
it
become
obvious
that
the
japanese
be
overextend
and
they
weren
t
come
sub
patrol
begin
to
seem
meaningless
and
our
morale
begin
to
sink
i
have
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
avoid
confrontation
with
major
nelson
our
commander
our
first
run
in
have
be
back
in
anniston
where
i
be
the
squadron
safety
officer
and
he
thought
i
take
my
responsibility
too
seriously
it
make
no
difference
to
him
that
the
airplane
we
be
fly
be
hard
to
maneuver
and
that
the
runway
on
our
field
be
dangerously
short
with
a
mountain
at
one
end
whenever
i
d
make
a
suggestion
to
improve
our
procedure
nelson
would
make
fun
of
me
he
thought
i
be
a
spoil
rich
boy
i
thought
he
be
about
the
poorest
leader
i
d
ever
met
after
we
d
be
in
california
a
few
week
they
start
to
pluck
men
out
of
our
unit
to
replace
crew
that
have
be
shot
down
in
new
guinea
the
way
nelson
let
us
know
about
this
be
by
get
the
squadron
together
one
morning
call
off
three
name
and
say
let
that
be
a
lesson
to
the
rest
of
you
guy
straighten
up
or
you
re
next
i
thought
this
be
no
way
to
send
men
off
to
fight
it
would
have
be
great
if
the
army
have
kept
us
together
give
us
decent
airplane
and
make
us
a
bomb
squadron
we
have
work
relationship
with
each
other
and
we
all
knew
our
job
but
it
be
obvious
they
be
just
go
to
pick
us
to
piece
and
our
commander
be
comply
instead
of
try
to
get
the
best
deal
for
his
men
i
decide
to
use
every
tool
at
my
disposal
to
transfer
out
of
there
before
nelson
get
me
ever
since
then
when
i
think
trouble
be
come
my
way
i
ve
always
take
evasive
action
even
if
it
mean
make
a
mistake
i
never
lie
dead
in
the
water
i
sent
wire
to
everyone
i
knew
in
position
of
command
say
i
want
to
fly
bomber
i
go
to
our
group
commander
and
try
to
convince
him
that
the
military
could
use
my
experience
elsewhere
but
he
didn
t
rise
to
the
bait
meanwhile
three
more
crew
get
select
every
time
nelson
line
us
up
i
d
think
it
s
go
to
be
watson
finally
i
be
desperate
i
call
my
father
i
told
him
i
m
not
shirk
i
want
you
to
help
me
get
into
bombardment
and
i
want
to
join
a
squadron
that
s
just
be
form
so
i
can
go
through
training
and
know
the
people
i
m
fly
with
dad
be
quiet
for
a
moment
and
say

m
reluctant
to

one
night
when

idea
so
we

it
i
have
just
about

it
back

place
when
the
people
we
d
picked
scream
and
jumped
out
of
their

then
i
felt
someone
tap
me
on
the
shoulder
it
be
the
aide
of
the
assistant
commandant
of

be
amuse
by
your
antic
olive

pretty
strong
talk

this
business
she
say
when
you
graduate
your
father
s
go
to
be
here
and
you
don
t
want
to
be
the
class
clown
she
caught
me
completely
off
guard
two
month
earlier
i
d
be

irresponsible
with
my
car
but
when
it
come
to
dad
s
expectation
she
have
a
well
idea
than
i
do
about
what

the
straight
path
from
that
night
on
she
help
keep
me
on
it
dad
do
come
to
my
graduation
he
be
proud
of
my
accomplishment
although
it
seem
to
me
he
be
a
little
subdue
while
he
be
in

get
a
fellow
from
the
kansa
city

institute
to
paint

portrait
ibm
have
some
connection
there
the
painting
wasn
t
so
hot
and
once
i
figure
out
why
dad
have
have
it
do
look
at
it
make
me
uneasy
he
knew
that
by

closer
to
the
war
and
he
be
prepare
himself
in
case

finally
i
felt
in
a
position
to
do
something
that
count
my
war
be
go
to
involve
fly
airplane
the
one
thing
i
knew

bursting
with
activity
expand
from
three
hundred
fifty
thousand
men
to
more
than
two
million
the
battle
of

have
make
it
obvious
that
no
one
be
go
to
win
the
war
without
master
the
air
from
now
on
airplane

to
be
as
important
to
victory
as
battleship
or
tank
i
be
thrill
to
be
part
of
this
and
even
though
in
the
end
i
didn
t
get
promote
as
far
as
some
people
or
come
back
with
as
many
medal
my
success
be
my
own
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
wasn
t
worried
about
be
overshadow
by
dad
at
the
time
i
left
leavenworth
one
of
the
big
job
face
the
air
force
be
transport
heavy

be
churn
out

such
as
b
s
by
the
thousand
these
airplane
couldn
t
hold
enough
fuel
to
make
it
directly
across
the
atlantic
to
their
base
in
england
they
have
to
skirt
the
ocean
fly
up
the
atlantic
seaboard
to
newfoundland
across
with
stop
in
greenland
and
iceland
and
finally
down
through

the
airplane
jumping
off
place
be
new
england
part
of
the
territory
of
the
first
air
force
and
that
be
where
i
be
assign
my
first
job
be
a
minor
one
in
those
day
most
army
pilot
didn
t
know
how
to
fly
on
instrument
and
there
be
numerous
crash
a
pilot
would
enter
a
cloud
bank
lose
his
sense
of
direction
and
fly
right
into
the
ground
i
be
suppose
to
help
remedy
this
by
promote
the
use
of
link
trainer
these
be
crude
flight
simulator
and
if
a
man
spent
enough
time
in
one
he
could
learn
to
fly
blind
all
the
air
base
have
them
and
the
trainer
would
have
help
a
great
deal
except
that
most
pilot
didn
t
know
about
them
i
be
suppose
to
change
that
it
be
basically
a
sale
job
and
i
work
hard
at
it
because
it
be
my
first
chance
in
the
army
to
shine
i
flew
to
base
from
presque
isle
maine
to
philadelphia
preach
link
trainer
i
badger
commander
for
statistic
on
trainer
usage
and
show
them
how
theirs
compare
with
the
record
of
other
base
i
get
senior
officer
to
write
letter
recommend
the
thing
i
go
totally
overboard
but
usage
of
the
trainer
go
up
by
a
factor
of
six
and
i
think
i
save
some
life
this
modest
success
caught
the
attention
of
major
general
follett
bradley
the
head
of
the
first

would
become
his
aide
de
camp
his
offer
take
me
by
surprise
and
pose
a
real
dilemma
if
i
say
no
it
might
hurt
my
chance
in
the
air
force
but
if
i
say
yes
i
might
be
get
into
a
personal
service
job
that
i
didn
t
want
and
didn
t
know
how
to
handle

the
wife
of
general
aide
always
end
up
work
as
aide
to
the
general
wife
but
we
decide
that
the
job
be
a
step
forward
and
i
take
it
it
be
the
best
thing
that

have
happen

after
that
he
d
frequently
ride
down
in
the
plane
s
nose
chat
with
some
other
officer
while
i
sat
proudly
at
the
control
gain
confidence
by
the
minute
i
want
to
be
as
much
help
to
him
as
i
could
bradley
be
busy
make
inspection
around
new
england
try
to
get
the
bomber
overseas
faster
there
be
problem
with
overcrowd
and
delay
at
airport
along
the
transport
route
at
the
first
field
we
come
to
in
northern
massachusetts
he
and
a
couple
of
other
men
tour
the
base
while
i
stood
wait
near
the
plane
before
they
come
back
i
say
to
myself
this
be
a
great
waste
of
time
i
need
to
assure
myself
that
i
be
something
more
than
an
aerial
chauffeur
by
our
next
stop
hartford
i
have
decide
that
i
d
follow
the
general
everywhere
unless
he
told
me
not
to
and
that
i
d
write
him
a
complete
summary
of
each
inspection
in
these
report
i
discuss
the
officer
we
met
supply
that
be
need
and
my
own
recommendation
about
operation
i
note
right
away
that
part
of
the
bomber
delay
problem
be
psychological
the
longer
a
bomber
group
stayed
at
an
airport
in
the
u
s
the
longer
they
want
to
stay
if
they
move
directly
through
new
england
and
out
to
gander
in
newfoundland
or
goose
bay
labrador
they
d
go
on
and
finish
the
trip
in
a
week
but
if
there
be
not
constant
pressure
on
the
group
to
move
move
move
the
delay
pile
up
that
be
the
sort
of
observation
i
d
write
on
these
report
bradley
would
often
scrawl
thank
you
very
much
and
sometimes
excellent
or
even
splendid
small
compliment
that
drove
me
to
do
an
even
well
and
more
vigorous
job
my
month
with
bradley
be
among
the
most
important
of
my
life
because
he
show
me
that
i
have
an
orderly
mind
and
an
unusual
ability
to
focus
on
what
be
important
and
put
it
across
to
others
after
only
a
couple
of
week
bradley
take
me
to
washington
when
i
ask
what
we
be
do
he
say
we
be
go
to
get
me
promote
to
captain
he
knew
how
much
this
meant
to
me
after
finish
the
paperwork
he
walk
me
to
the
px
in
the
old
munition
building
bought
captain
s
bar
and
pin

on
me
himself
in
early
summer
bradley
be
order
to
moscow
to
oversee
a
much
more
ticklish
transport
problem
get
airplane
to
stalin
russia
be
in
desperate
need
of
weapon
and
supply
from
the
u
s
the
german
have
leningrad
under
siege
in
the
north

be
closing
in
on
stalingrad
and
the
oilfield
near
baku
in
the
south

of
the
big
headache
be
how
to
deliver
p
and
p
fighter
and
a
light
bomber
because
of
their
short
range
the
only
possible
way
to
deliver
large
number
of
these
plane
quickly
and
safely
be
to
fly
them
to
alaska
and
then
in
short
hop
five
thousand
mile
across
siberia
bradley
s
job
be
to
get
this
ferry
route
set
up
a
matter
of
great
strategic
importance
when
he
ask
if
i
would
come
along
my
immediate
reply
be
nothing
would
please
me
more
but
in
fact
i
be
fill
with
dread
the
war
have
reach
its
grimmest
point
with
the
axis
power
dominant
on
every
front
and
i
be
commit
myself
to
an
indefinite
stay
abroad
possibly
for
year
olive
and
i
spent
sleepless
night
wonder
what
be

to
happen
and
how
she
be
go
to
get
through
her
pregnancy
alone

that
point
i
couldn
t
even
tell
her
where
i
be
go
we
d
be
order
to
refer
to
our
destination
only
as
plainfield
get
ready
for
that
trip
be
the
big
job
i
d
ever
undertaken
bradley
say
we
might
be
in
moscow
as
long
as
eight
month
and
that
we
d
be
lucky
to
get
food
and
housing
everything
else
we
might
need
have
to
be
brought
along
i

three
hot
week

an
ibm

a
washington
hotel
write

to
coldproof
an
airplane
recreational
reading
material
and
so
on
anything
that
be
forgotten
be
go
to
be
my
fault
we
drew
a
brand
new
b
the
most
advanced
heavy
bomber
and
bradley
hand
picked
the
crew
include
lee
fiegel

experienced
bomber
man
for
pilot
even
though
i
d
organize
the
trip
bradley
demote
me
to
copilot
because
i
have
no
experience
in
four
engine
plane
i
have
to
admit
that
the
b
awed
me
before
the
service
i
d
flown
nothing
but
little
puddle
jumper
and
navigate
with
a
road
map
in
the
national
guard
we
still
have
single

and
it
be
big
stuff
to
fly
from
alabama

york
seven
hundred
mile
or
about
three
hour
now

crew
of
eight
gun
port
and
a
range
of
twenty
six
hundred
mile
when
equip
with
extra
fuel
tank
lee
spent
a
lot
of
time

we
become
lifelong
friend
two
day
before
we
left
my
parent

me
take
mother
up
in
the
bomber
she
d
never
be

before
but
she
seem
to
enjoy
it
while
dad
stood
by
nervously
on
the
ground
even
in
a
b
the
wartime
flight
to
moscow
be
a
tremendous
undertaking
get
there
take
ten
day
we
have
to
go
south
to
brazil
cross
to
africa
and
then
wend
our
way
up
avoid
the
colonial
territory
control
by
the
vichy
government
then
north
via
cairo
palestine
and
teheran
and
over
the
caucasus
mountain
into
russia
like
many
aviator
in
those
day
i
be
very
nervous
about
fly
over
water
far
from
any
airfield
in
case
we
have
trouble
we
cross
the
south
atlantic
on
a
full
moon
night
with
cumulus
cloud
billowing
up
in
ghostly
pillar
halfway
across
i
make
a
routine
check
on
the
crew
i
climbed
down
from
the
flight
deck
into
the
nose
where
the
navigator
work
we
didn
t
have
the
experienced
man
bradley
have
picked
for
the
job
but
a
last
minute
substitute
he
be
almost
completely
bald
and
i
could
see
his
head
slump
down
on
the
big
navigate
table
in
front
of
him
i
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
jumped
how
s
it
go
bill
i
say
i
don
t
know
i
just
can
t
get
start
i
look
on
the
floor
and
there
be
about
twenty
little
ball
of
crumple
up
paper
what
s
all
this
i
can
t
get
any
of
the
sight
to
work
out
what
do
you
mean
we
re
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
yeah
but
this
be
the
southern
hemisphere
i
really
don
t
know
these
star
i
go
back
up
and
say
to
lee
i
think
it
s
too
late
to
do
anything
but
stay
on
the
course
this
guy
have
set
but
he
say
he
doesn
t
know
where
we
be
lee
go
down
and
talk
to
him
for
a
while
there
be
no
point
in
bawling
him
out
so
we
didn
t
do
that
we
be
head
in
the
right
general
direction
but
it
be
impossible
to
tell
exactly
where
we
be
at
dawn
we
start
look
anxiously
for
land
and
didn
t
see
any
until
an
hour
after
we
be
suppose
to
by
the
time
we
finally
put
down
at
accra
in
what
be
now
ghana
the
gas
gauge
be
at
zero
that
wasn
t
our
only
close
call
on
the
trip
a
few
day
later
when
we
cross
into
russia
and
be
about
to
stop
for
fuel
at
baku
on
the
caspian
sea
i
climbed
down
into
the
belly
of
the
plane
directly
beneath
the
flight
deck
to
check
the
nose
wheel
before
land
i
be
still
in
the
middle
of
this
routine
when
lee
absentmindedly
push
the
land
gear
control
to
the
down
position
it
be
totally
out
of
character
for
him
to
make
a
mistake
like
that
but
this
time
he
do
to
my
horror
the
giant
wheel
i
be
inspect
begin
ponderously
to
drop
through
the
ever
widen
opening
in
the
floor
of
the
compartment
i
leap
toward
the
navigator
s
deck
and
almost
make
it
but
one
of
my
leg
get
pin
i
scream
at
the
navigator
to
give
me
his
headphone
and
force
myself
not
to
panic
as
i
described
my
situation
to
lee
i
m
caught
one
leg
between
the
land
gear
door
and
the
side
of
the
aircraft
and
the
other
side
of
the
door
be
rest
on
top
of
the
nose
wheel
strut
if
you
land
now
the
travel
of
the
nose
wheel
will
cause
that
door
to
cut
my
leg
off
i
be
spread
eagle
over
the
open
door
with
the
oilfield
of
baku
a
thousand
foot
below
the
radio
operator
come
down
take
a
look
at
my
situation
become
faint
and
have
to
be
pull
back
into
the
safety
of
the
bomb
bay
then
general
bradley
come
down
wear
his
pince
nez
he
take
a
long
look
and
call
for
a
hacksaw
within
five
minute
he
saw
through
the
hinge
at
the
rear
of
the
land
gear
door
and
it
fell
loose
free
my
leg
when
we
reach
moscow
in
august
the
tide
of
the
war
be
about
to
turn
but
that
be
not
discernible
to
the
russian
or
to
us
hitler
s
best
army
be
hammer
at
them
for
the
second
year
and
the
casualty
at
place
like
leningrad
and
sevastopol
must
have
be
appal
even
to
stalin
already
million
of
russian
be
dead
of
wound
and
starvation
and
million
more
have
be
capture
the
year
before
the
nazi
have
come
so
close
to
moscow
that
they
could
be
see
from
the
tower
of
the
kremlin
most
of
the
government
along
with
the
allied
embassy
pull
back
to
the
town
of
kuybyshev
five
hundred
mile
to
the
rear
the
russian
winter
and
the
courage
of
the
red
army
have
thrown
the
nazi
back
but
when
we
get
there
moscow
be
still
officially
in
a
state
of
siege
we
move
into
the
national
hotel
overlook
red
square
in
the
moat
next
to
the
kremlin
which
be
visible
from
our
room
there
be
a
fleet
of
small
truck
load
with
file
case
those
be
the
archive
of
the
russian
nation
ready
to
be
evacuate
if
the
nazi
reach
the
gate
again
all
day
long
clerk
would
come
out
to
the
truck
pick
out
file
and
run
back
inside
the
people
you
d
see
on
the
street
show
obvious
sign
of
malnutrition
red
eyelid
sunken
cheek
and
fat
belly
from
eat
nothing
but
bread
they
be
so
poor
and
transport
be
so
short
that
mourner
on
the
way
to
funeral
carry
their
dead
wrap
in
sack
in
their
arm
scarcely
a
week
after
we
get
to
moscow
winston
churchill
flew
in
stalin
have
be
push
for
an
immediate
invasion
of
europe
by
england
and
the
u
s
and
churchill
come
to
tell
him
face
to
face
that
this
wasn
t
go
to
happen
anytime
soon
in
his
memoir
churchill
compare
this
to
deliver
a
large
lump
of
ice
to
the
north
pole
it
take
him
three
day
to
calm
the
russian

and
when

off
for
cairo
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
we
be
his
arm

as
far
as
teheran
the
night
before
i
d
have
the
great
experience
of
attend
a
diplomatic
reception
and
shake
the
prime
minister
s
hand
unfortunately
the
flight
with
churchill
be
the
occasion
of
a
major
blow
up
between
me
and
our
crew
we
d
only
be
away
from
home
three
week
but
already
a
pattern
be
develop
every
time
we
really
need
these
men
some
of
them
be
drunk
it
be
my
job

to
fly
if
we
be
suppose
to
take
off
at
a
m
i
d
get
up
at
and
go
into
their
room
and
drag
them
out
on
the
morning
we
be
suppose
to

with
churchill
i
found
the
master

and
the
crew
chief
play
strip
poker
with
a
bunch
of
russian
babe
on
the
way
out
i
jumped
all
over
the
sergeant
god
damn
it
you
don
t
have
to
fly
more
than
once
every
few
day
and
every
time
we
fly
you
re
load
he
claimed
he
be
do
more
card
play
than
drinking
but
i
didn
t
believe
it
when
we
get
to
the
plane
he
have
to
inspect
the
engine
and
he
forgot
to
screw
the
cover
back
on
after
check
the
oil
so
just
as
we
broke
ground
on
the
runway
section
of
cowl
flew
up
on
all
four
engine
and
eventually
tore
away
i
m
sure
churchill
s
pilot
saw
that
and
wonder
what
the
hell
be
happen
to
our
airplane
i
really
bore
in
on
the
sergeant
for
that
general
bradley
s
discussion
with
the
soviet
didn
t
go
any
more
smoothly
than
churchill
s
i
wasn
t
in
on
the
meeting
but
among
my
other
duty
i
be
the
mission
s
code
clerk
and
saw
all
the
message
that
go
out
the
behavior
of
both
side
be
pretty
disillusion
the
russian
be
as
annoy
as
they
sometimes
be
today
we
be
try
to
do
them
and
ourselves
a
favor
bring
airplane
across
siberia
and
they
be
give
bradley
guff
about
the
type
of
rubber
in
the
tire
bradley
have
to
have
interminable
discussion
with
them
about
the
airplane
specification
the
schedule
on
which
they
d
be
available
the
number
of
pilot
the
u
s
would
use
to
deliver
them
and
so
on
even
then
the
russian
be
convince
we
mainly
want
to
spy
so
they
decide
to
use
their
own
pilot
to
fly
the
plane
across
siberia
now
it
be
the
war
department
s
turn
to
be
intransigent
when
it
heard
that
russia
wasn
t
go
to
let
u
s
pilot
in
it
cut
from
forty
to
ten
the
number
of
transport
plane
be
offer
to
bring
pilot
back
to
alaska
on
the
return
leg
of
the
ferry
route
that
be
very
hard
for
me
to
accept
as
fair
there
be
no
question
about
the
qualification
of
the
russian
pilot
so
how
could
we
justify
make
it
hard
for
them
to
do
their
job
this
tedious
debate
go
on
and
on
and
i
spent
many
hour
slide
small
strip
of
paper
back
and
forth
in
metal
rack
which
be
the
method
we
use
for
cod
and
decode
telegram
if
nothing
else
i
demonstrate
to
bradley
that
i
have
a
certain
evenness
of
temper
and
an
ability
to
work
in
a
sustain
way
before
long
the
general
start
turn
to
me
when
he
have
a
decision
to
hash
out
in
retrospect
i
think
that
he
may
have
see
me
as
sort
of
a
son
his
own
boy
have
be
kill
demonstrate
a
b
over
england
before
we
get
into
the
war
there
be
another
bond
between
us
we
be
both
unhappy
because
we
weren
t
get
any
letter
from
our
wife
i
miss
olive
desperately
and
our
first
baby
be
on
the
way
but
unluckily
for
me
she
and
mr

become
friend
mr
bradley

how
to
address
her
letter
to
me
but
mr
bradley
say
oh
no
that
s
wrong
here
s
the
way
you
write
them
as
a
result
bradley
and
i
didn
t
get
any
mail
while
everybody
else
in
the
crew
be
get
letter
every
week
homesickness
and
longing
for
my
wife
hit
me
in
wave
i
be
never
without
these
emotion
but
sometimes
i
d
feel
as
if
there
be
a
knife
twist
in
my
chest
at
those
moment
i
d
damn
hitler
and
hirohito
and
dream
of
settle
down
to
married
life
in
a
home
of
my
own
life
in
moscow
get
pretty
slow
during
the
three
month
it
take
bradley
to
settle
thing
with
the
russian
the
heavy
autumn
rain
that
slow
down
hitler
s
army
come
and
go
and
then
the
temperature
drop
well
below
zero
the
russian
have
kept
their
ballet
and
opera
company
go
in
spite
of
the
war
and
we
saw
some
good
performance
a
number
of
us
even
take
russian
lesson
periodically
we
d
be
sent
down
to
teheran
where
you
could
buy
anything
and
we
d
come
back
with
the
bomb
bay
full
of
food
and
other
necessity
for
the
embassy
staff
llewellyn
thompson
rode
along
on
one
of
those
trip
and
become
my
friend
he
be
a
junior
diplomat
then
but
go
on
to
become
perhaps
the
great
u
s
ambassador
to
the
soviet
union
i
be
also
friendly
with
some
of
the
foreign
correspondent
like
eddie
gilmore
walter
kerr
of
the
new
york
herald
tribune
henry
shapiro
and
ben
robertson

primary
source
of
news
be
the
bbc
which
carry
reliable
war
coverage
every
afternoon
i
be
eager
to
hear
about
the
battle
for
north
africa
because
i
be
convince
that
the
fight
against
rommel
would
foretell
the
outcome
of
the
war
the
british
make
slow
progress
at
first
but
when
they
beat
the
german
at
el
alamein
and
when
the
american
land
in
algeria
and
morocco
a
few
day
later
the
mood
brighten
considerably
at
our
nightly
poker
game
i
be
the
only
one
of
our
crew

have
be

during
the
summer
of

be
tremendously
curious
to
see
how
the
city
have
change
whenever
i
get
loose
i
d
find
another
crew
member
and
walk
for
five
or
ten
mile
woman
constantly
introduce
themselves
to
us
we
figure
they
be
informer
but
we
d
have
go
stir
crazy
not
talk
to
anybody
but
each
other
for
three
month
mostly
the
married
men
stayed
straight
but
thing
get
pretty
complicate
for
some
of
the
crew
at
one
point
three
of
them
be
all
see
the
same
girl
whose
name
be
ludmilla
and
who
claimed

i
make
friend
with
a
nurse
call

who
somehow
get
my
name
and
telephone
me
at
our
little
office

talk
with
the
aid
of
two
dictionary
and
spent
a
fair
amount
of
time
together
although
the
relationship
be
platonic
after
a
few
week
we
be
able
to
communicate
pretty
well
and
she
take
me
to
visit
her
apartment
there
be
three
different
family
living
there
tanya
have
what

and
we
packed
up
to

we
d
be
back
in
russia
soon
since
american
would
be
need
to
help
oversee
the
transport
operation
the
russian
be
pleased
enough
that
they
give
us
permission
to
fly
home
by
the
route
that
best
suit
our
need
southeastward
into
china
where
bradley
have
to
confer
with
another
u
s
general
then
across
siberia
to
alaska
this
be
a
great
privilege
as
it
turn
out
we
be
one
of
the
few
american
military
crew
to
fly
eastbound
across
siberia
during
the
war
to
celebrate
our
bond
with
the
russian
bradley
name
our
airplane
the
muscovite
and
have
it
paint
on
the
nose
in
cyrillic
character
i
be
terribly
excite
to
see
china
again
especially
when
our
flight
path
parallel
the
great
wall
in
kansu
province
when
i
realize
that
i
d
see
a
part
of
this
same
wall
near
peking
in
i
be
amaze
peking
be
about
a
thousand
mile
away
we
land
at
the
ancient
city
of
ch
eng
tu
near
chiang
kaishek
s
wartime
capital
of
chunk
and
get
room
at
a
little
hostel
call
the
society
for
moral
endeavor
near
the
airfield
it
be
clean
and
neat
and
my
room
overlook
a
very
pretty
garden
everywhere
i
could
see
the
charm
that
make
me
want
to
return
to
china
again
and
again
we
lay
over
for
a
few
day
to
get
the
airplane
ready
for
fly
in
the
siberian
winter
bradley
put
me
in
charge
and
i
sort
out
the
task
and
assign
them
to
the
men
toward
the
end
of
the
first
day
i
mention
to
them
that
we
d
almost
certainly
have
another
mission
to
russia
to
my
surprise
the
men
say
don
t
count
on
us
and
bluntly
told
me
that
they
d
rather
have
combat
assignment
than
go
through
another
trip
with
me
it
be
one
of
the
rudest
shock
i
ve
ever
experienced
here
i
be
well
into
my
air
force
career
the
son
of
a
famous
manager
and
i
still
hadn
t
learn
how
to
handle
the
men
work
for
me
by
be
so
eager
to
please
bradley
i
have
antagonize
everybody
below
they
complain
i
be
too
demand
never
relaxed
the
pace
and
insist
on
get
every
job
do
perfectly
they
thought
i
be
petty
and
they
be
right
petty
criticism
be
not
useful
if
people
be
do
a
reasonably
good
job
if
their
energy
level
be
high
and
their
aim
be
fairly
close
to
the
target
it
s
well
to
let
thing
jog
along
i
say
to
myself
i
can
t
get
anywhere
if
i
can
t
manage
these
men
i
decide
to
do
what
i
could
to
win
them
over
for
starter
i
drove
them
twenty
four
mile
into
ch
eng
tu
where
i
bought
them
the
best
dinner
i
could
find
and
thanked
them
for
all
they
d
do
on
the
next
leg
of
our
flight
i
try
to
ask
each
man
how
his
spirit
be
and
whether
he
d
gotten
any
mail
while
we
be
in
china
i
also
present
the
crew
with
little
piece
of
pewter
i
d
bought
in
ch
eng
tu
the
men
s
morale
be
improve
because
we
be
on
our
way
home
there
be
no
way
to
tell
if
my
effort
be
have
any
effect
our
flight
through
siberia
take
us
to
the
remote
town
of
yakutsk
on
the
lena
river
where
it
be
minus
degree
fahrenheit
when
we
arrive
i
have
to
admire
the
russian
for
maintain
a
real
town
this
far
north
even
if
one
of
its
main
industry
be
a
prison
yakutsk
be
use
as
a
place
to
exile
people
from
moscow
and
be
one
of
the
coldest
spot
on
earth
its
only
communication
with
the
outside
world
be
down
the
lena
river
which
empty
into
the
laptev
sea
in
the
arctic
at
one
point
i
take
off
my
glove
not
think
and
froze
my
finger
on
the
propeller
control
the
follow
night
we
take
off
hop
to
push
straight
through
to
nome
alaska
two
thousand
mile
to
the
east
but
it
be
about
below
and
the
cold
be
affect
the
way
the
engine
cool
and
lubricate
themselves
my
job
as
copilot
be
to
manage
the
engine
and
our
number
four
engine
be
only
deliver
about
half
power
i
have
to
push
the
three
good
engine
beyond
their
safe
setting
to
get
us
into
the
air
we
climbed
very
well
through
moonlight
and
broken
cloud
for
about
twenty
minute
and
i
begin
to
think
we
might
make
it
but
about
half
an
hour
after
takeoff
the
oil
temperature
on
number
four
go
up
and
its
oil
pressure
go
down
when
that
happens
something
be
seriously
wrong
and
you
have
to
act
fast
because
the
engine
will
catch
fire
once
it
get
hot
enough
i
say
i
think
we
ought
to
shut
down
that
engine
there
be
no
immediate
response
none
of
us
be
think
terribly
clearly
because
the
flight
deck
heater
be
broken
and
it
be
so
cold
fiegel
didn
t
say
much
and
the
general
who
be
stand
between
us
didn
t
either
i
say
i
don
t
want
to
be
an
s
o
b
here
but
if
we
don
t
do
something
about
that
engine
we
may
not
be
able
to
shut
it
down
i
recommend
we
shut
down
the
damn
engine
the
general
say
yeah
i
think
you
d
well
do
that
tom
there
be
a
big
red
button
and
i
punch
it
and
the
engine
stop
quite
nicely
we
didn
t
have
full
power
on
the
other
three
because
number
two
be
a
little
sick
as
well
maybe
we
have
percent
power
altogether
we
be
in
real
trouble
pick
up
ice
unable
to
hold
our
altitude
but
still
head
for
nome
eighteen
hundred
mile
away
we
be
make
no
effort
to
turn
i
sat
that
out
for
maybe
one
minute
then
i
say
hey
fella
don
t
tell
me
we
re
go
to
fly
to
nome
on
three
engine
we
re
get
ice
right
now
and
we
ll
get
far
and
far
out
here
where
there
s
no
airport
and
we
ll
have
a
hell
of
a
time
finally
bradley
say
we
should
turn
back
the
light
of
yakutsk
be
one
of
the
grandest
sight
i
have
ever
see
because
i
thought
we
would
never
make
it
back
alive
by
now
it
be
snow
hard
our
flap
didn
t
work
and
we
could
barely
get
the
land
gear
down
we
start
to
sink
at
an
alarm
rate
and
i
push
the
two
good
engine
past
their
limit
to
check
us
the
plane
be
so
heavy
with
ice
that
it
take
all
the
strength
of
both
lee
and
me
at
the
control
to
handle
it
at
all
we
make
our
last
turn
just
off
the
ground
and
it
look
to
me
as
though
we
be
go
to
crack
up
but
we
finally
straighten
out
for
the
runway
which
be
dimly
visible
through
the
snow
we
be
still
sinking
i
saw
tree
ahead
and
yell
at
lee
but
he
couldn
t
see
them
because
of
the
ice
on
his
windshield
so
i
pull
back
on
the
wheel
and
blast
the
throttle
the
boy
in
the
cabin
told
me
that
at
that
point
the
general
cover
his
eye
we
zoom
over
the
tree
and
hit
the
end
of
the
runway
without
much
of
a
bump
i
think
we
be
all
as
pleased
as
if
the
war
be
over
we
be
back
in
town
before
dawn
very
glad
to
see
our
warm
room
with
their
rough
hewn
timber
wall
and
coal
stove
our
plane
be
finish
for
the
winter
and
we
be
stuck
in
yakutsk
for
a
week
before
the
russian
could
arrange
a
cargo
plane
to
take
us
out
most
of
the
crew
be
content
to
sit
around
their
room
but
in
spite
of
the
cold
i
get
out
every
day
with
harley
trice
our
interpreter
to
see
the
town
whenever
we
walk
one
or
two
of
the
local
commissar
would
join
us
and
a
crowd
would
gather
i
ll
warrant
that
few
than
twenty
five
foreigner
who
weren
t
also
prisoner
have
be
there
in
fifty
year
the
west
side
of
yakutsk
seem
to
be
one
big
prison
camp
though
they
never
let
us
get
close
enough
to
be
sure
the
town
be
full
of
pole
who
be
ex
prisoner
and
still
too
poor
to
leave
and
many
of
the
people
we
met
spoke
french
or
german
the
place
also
have
a
strong
native
culture
which
i
found
much
more
charm
than
the
communist
culture
the
native
call
yakut
look
like
a
cross
between
eskimo
and
chinese
with
slant
eye
and
fierce
mustache
they
wore
felt
boot
and
fur
garment
and
drove
little
siberian
pony
or
reindeer
we
froze
until
they
supply
us
with
legging
glove
and
boot
and
i
bought
a
fur
coat
for
my
soon
to
be
born
baby
at
the
town
museum
which
be
unheated
we
saw
a
mastodon
that
have
be
dug
up
nearby
and
the
mummy
of
a
native
princess
dress
in
very
rich
fur
and
bead
there
be
implement
that
indicate
a
very
old
civilization
on
our
third
day
in
yakutsk
we
go
out
to
watch
ice
cut
on
the
snow
cover
river
there
one
really
get
a
picture
of
the
frozen
waste
of
siberia
the
river
plain
be
flat
and
snowy
and
dismal
in
the
distance
i
could
see
the
town
belching
dense
cloud
of
coal
smoke
in
a
vain
effort
to
fend
off
the
cold
it
be
so
penetrate
that
it
froze
our
eyelash
that
night
the
general
ask
me
to
come
up
to
his
room
we
talk
about
everything
under
the
sun
eventually
he
brought
up
the
next
mission
into
russia
say
that
lee
fiegel
didn
t
like
staff
work
much
and
wasn
t
interested
in
go
again
he
say
tom
i
be
go
to
make
you
first
pilot
you
have
work
hard
and
you
ve
learn
a
lot
and
i
m
very
pleased
you
can
depend
on
this
if
he
have
give
me
a
million
dollar
i
couldn
t
have
felt
well
that
night
i
go
right
down
to
the
crew
chief
s
room
told
him
i
hop
he
didn
t
feel
as
bad
as
he
once
have
about
me
and
ask
if
he
d
stay
on
he
say
yes
so
do
the
rest
of
the
men
the
effort
i
d
make
with
them
save
me
the
great
embarrassment
of
have
to
tell
bradley
that
his
crew
have
reject
me
as
its
leader
the
funny
thing
be
that
once
i
d
really
start
think
about
the
men
i
found
it
easy
to
make
them
reasonably
happy
the
old
angle
really
work
a
little
recognition
a
few
pat
on
the
back
we
finally
flew
out
in
a
russian
cargo

that
take
us

the
sharp
leaden

great
success
by

nearly
eight
thousand

their
way
along

me
permission
to
borrow
the

an
hour
later

at
la
guardia
field
and
there
sit
on
a
wall
be
my
beautiful
olive
with
father
stand
beside
her
when
i
saw
them
both
i
knew
the
baby
be
dead
the
nurse
have
take
him
to
the
park
in
his
carriage
and
somehow
he
d
die
in
his
sleep
olive
be
beside
herself
with
grief
and
father
be
upset
that
she
have
come
out
because
in
his
old
fashion
way
he
thought
she
should
sit
with
the
dead
baby
for
twenty
four
hour
but
she
didn
t
want
to
see
the
body
at
all
and
i
didn
t
blame
her
as
soon
as
we
get
back
to
our
small
apartment
i
go
to
look
at
the
carriage
i
take
the
sheet
out
and
then
i
take
the
pillowcase
off
and
there
be
a
little
trace
of
blood
right
where
the
baby
s
mouth
would
have
be
he
have
obviously
suffocate
and
thrown
out
some
blood
in
his
struggle
i
put
the
pillowcase
in
the
wash
machine
and
hid
away
the
baby
s
other
personal
thing
we
decide
we
d
well
ask
for
an
autopsy
to
see
if
there
be
something
wrong
with
us
as
parent
so
they
come
and
take
the
baby
we
never
get
a
write
report
the
doctor
simply
say
you
have
nothing
to
worry
about
go
right
ahead
and
have
more
baby
the
next
day
a
death
notice
appear
in
the
paper
and
our
telephone
rang
it
be
ben
robertson
one
of
the
correspondent
i
d
met
in
moscow
i
say
hello
ben
nice
to
hear
your
voice
we
ve
get
a
tragedy
here
and
i
just
can
t
talk
now
i
know
about
the
tragedy
i
m
here
in
your
building
what
do
you
mean
i
want
to
talk
to
you
come
on
down
i
go
downstairs
and
he
walk
me
to
the
park
and
back
and
say
just
enough
that
i
felt
a
little
well
i
didn
t
know
ben
well
and
it
meant
so
much
to
me
that
he
would
do
that
it
be
an
act
of
singular
kindness
that
night
he
get
on
a
pan
be
fly
boat
and
be
kill
when
it
flip
over
land
in
fog
in
lisbon
harbor
but
he
have
taught
me
a
crucial
lesson
if
you
can
help
a
man
in
a
period
of
great
grief
you
should
go
out
of
your
way
to
do
it
we
bury
the
baby
at
sleepy
hollow
cemetery
in
westchester
county
where
my
father
own
a
plot
that
have
be
empty
up
to
now
it
be
awful
pile
into
a
car
in
the
middle
of
winter
and
go
to
see
that
little
coffin
lower
into
the
ground
then
i
take
olive
away
to
a
resort
for
military
people
near
jacksonville
florida
it
be
an
overnight
train
ride
and
i
d
bought
a
bottle
of
scotch
i
pour
olive
a
drink
and
me
a
drink
then
i
say
i
don
t
think
this
be
go
to
help
much
with
this
kind
of
problem
she
say
i
agree
with
you
so
i
pour
the
scotch
down
the
basin
and
we
sat
together
and
felt
all
our
sorrow
i
steer
clear
of
ibm
for
most
of
the
war
dad
and
i
saw
each
other
a
number
of
time
each
year
but
never
discuss
the
business
and
yet
ibm
be
hard
to
avoid
the
entire
military
be
begin
to
move
by
ibm
card
because
warfare
have
become
so
big
and
complicate
that
book
keep
have
to
be
do
right
on
the
battlefield
toward
the
end
of
the
war
i
d
land
on
some
pacific
atoll
just
take
from
the
japanese
and
find
a
mobile
punch
card
unit
there
tabulate
the
payroll
these
be
the
invention
of
my
brother
dick
who
be
a
major
in
the
army
ordnance
corp
by
the
end
of
the
war
it
be
his
idea
to
put
punch
card
machine
on
army
truck
for
use
in
combat
zone
ibm
card
kept
track
of
bombing
result
casualty
prisoner
displace
person
and
supply
there
be
a
punch
card
record
of
every
man
draft
and
it
follow
him
through
induction
classification
training
and
service
right
up
to
his
discharge
there
be
also
ibm
machine
involve
in
a
lot
of
top
secret
application
our
equipment
be
use
to
break
the
japanese
code
before
the
battle
of
midway
and
to
help
in
hunt
down
german
u
boat
at
sea
make
machine
for
the
arm
force
and
defense
supplier
would
have
be
enough
to
keep
ibm
s
factory
whir
at
full
capacity
but
ibm
be
also
call
on
to
make
ordnance
machine

for

infantry
carbine

and

he
be
very
sensitive
about

money
from

both
on
moral
ground
and
out
of
concern
for
ibm
s
image
he
didn
t
want
the
company
accuse
of

have
a
rule
that
ibm
could
make
no
more
than
one
percent
profit
on
munition
and
ibm

sale
triple
from
forty
six
million
dollar
in
to
one
hundred
forty
million
in
the
war
also
show
dad
that
ibm
could
expand
fast
without
lose
its
character
with
just
a
few
experienced
men
from
endicott
he
be
able
to
hire
two
thousand
new
people
at
poughkeepsie
teach
them

and
get
them

proud
of

as
he
call

this
success
increase

that
he
have
no
intention
of
allow
ibm
to
shrink
back
down
when
peace
come
my
father
go
out
of
his
way
to
back
up
the
ibm
people
who
have
join
the
service
he
paid
each
man
a
quarter
of
his
usual
pay
while
in
uniform
and
each
christmas
dad
would
send
a
box
of
food
and
gift
and
every
once
in
a
while
a
sweater
or
a
pair
of
glove
he
do
this
partly
out
of
patriotism
and
partly
out
of
shrewdness
because
he
want
those
skilled
people
to
come
back
i
get
war
pay
and
food
package

would
be
a
picture
of
dad
surround
by
flag
opening
yet
another
factory
with
a
band
and
a
diva
from
the
metropolitan
opera
on
hand
to
help
the
festivity
along
i
always
turn
down
dad
s
invitation
to
come
to
endicott
for
celebration
the
longer
i
work
with
general
bradley
the
more
i
thought
about
make
the
air
force
my
career
when
we
left
russia
we
expect
that
we
d
soon
go
back
to
help
supervise
the
siberian
air
transport
operation
but
the
russian
abruptly
stop
let
in
american
and
meanwhile
bradley
s
career
take
an
unexpected
turn
i
be
with
him
at
the
pentagon
just
after
christmas
when
a
call
come
from
the
white

ask
to

him
and
we
report
to
the
wing
of
the
white

opposite
the
oval
office
where

a
place
to

it
be
my
first
visit

and
i
thought

hopkins
be
the
next
best
thing
to
see
roosevelt
himself
by
then
hopkins
have
such
bad
stomach
trouble
that
after
shake
our
hand
he
stretch
out
on
a
chaise
longue
and
propped
his
foot
up
on
the
wall
don
t
mind
me
he
say
this
be
the
only
way
i
get
comfortable
bradley
sat
in
front
of
him
and
i
be
off
to
the
side
with
a
notebook
bradley
say

t
that
interest
i
know
him
he
s
the
only
business
friend
roosevelt
have
then
hopkins
turn
to
bradley
you
may
know
that
admiral

be
our
ambassador
to
the
soviet
union
be
leave
we
be
there
about
two
hour
and
i
left
with
a
fistful
of
note
they
have
discuss
the
soviet
and
while
hopkins
hadn
t
come
right
out
and
say
it
it
be
pretty
clear
that
bradley
be
go
to
be
offer
the
ambassadorship
the
last
thing
hopkins
say
to
us
be
i
m
sure
the
president
will
be
in
touch
with
you
within
a
few
day
as
we
drove
back
to
the
pentagon
bradley
say
if
it
s
true
would
you
go
back
to
russia
with
me
i
take
that
as
a
great
compliment
and
of
course
say
yes
the
first
four
day
we
do
nothing
but
wait
for
the
call
finally
after
about
two
week
bradley
say
what
do
you
think
i
guess

eventually
sent
averell
harriman
after
the
post

knock
bradley
out
of
the
run
he
have
a
weak
spot
where

concerned
and
the
u
s
embassy
official
in
moscow
object
to
his
appointment
bradley
have
live
in

ambassador
s
residence
while
we
be
there
more
than
thirty
year
later
after
i
become
ambassador
i
d
sometimes
go
into
his
old
room
and
sit
quietly
think
of
my
friend
how
much
he
d
do
for
me
and
how
sad
it
be
that
he
d
miss
out
on
something
he
really
want
after
bradley
give
up
wait
for
roosevelt
s
phone
call

him
to
the
new
post
of

which
be
later

this
meant
bradley
be
chief
troubleshooter
for
an
air
force
that
now
numbered
more
than
a
million
men
around
the
world
bradley
ask
me
to
stay
as
his
pilot
and
offer
me
a
place
as
a
technical
inspector
which
mainly
involve
go
around
to
air
base
to
see
that
plane
be
safely
maintain
i
be
happy
to
say
yes
even
though
we
d
be
base
in
washington
far
from
any
action
olive
have
be
badly
depressed
since
the
loss
of
our
baby
and
i
want
to
spend
time
with
her
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
i
flew
a
variety
of
inspection
mission
around
the
united
state
always
return
to
olive
after
a
week
or
ten
day
we
rent
a
little
house
in
the
virginia
countryside
and
be
able
to
live
together
for
the
first
time
it
be
great
come
home
from
a
trip
i
d
get
my
airplane
go
like
hell
and
come
in
low
right
over
our
roof
by
the
time
i
d
land
at
bolling
field
and
gotten
the
airplane
button
up
olive
would
be
drive
in
the
gate
to
meet
me
later
on
we
rent
an
apartment
closer
to
town
so
olive
would
have
people
to
talk
to
when
i
be
away
one
couple
living
near
us
be
eliot
and
molly
noyes
eliot
be
an
imaginative
fellow
who
ran
the
air
force
glider
program
and
later
become
one
of
the
world
s
great
industrial
designer
he
wore
such
thick
glass
that
i
be
amaze
to
learn
he
flew
but
i
guess
the
air
force
overlook
it
because
glider
pilot
be
hard
to
come
by
in
those
day
in
many
way
olive
and
i
be
like
any
ordinary
couple
start
out
right
down
to
the
fact
that
we
fought
about
money
i
have
no
idea
how
rich
we
be
because
dad
be
still
keep
me
in
the
dark
about
my
trust
fund
olive
and
i
have
what
seem
to
me
a
decent
income
i
work
my
way
up
to
lieutenant
colonel
and
get
about
a
month
include
flight
pay
plus
a
month
from
the
trust
fund
and
a
little
more
in
ibm
war
pay
but
i
have
one
of
our
account
book
for
those
year
show
what
we
spent
on
grocery
the
cleaning
lady
who
come
once
a
week
and
this
and
that
and
at
the
end
of
each
month
we
be
always
six
or
eight
dollar
in
the
red
i
use
to
dread
bring
up
the
subject
with
olive
she
be
do
her
best
to
run
a
thrifty
house
and
when
i
d
start
boring
in
about
our
monthly
deficit
she
didn
t
want
to
talk
about
it
she
would
go
into
what
i
d
call
her
mode
impossible
nothing
really
match
it
it
occur
to
me
once
or
twice
to
ask
dad
for
extra
cash
but
i
never
do
i
knew
he
expect
us
to
learn
financial
discipline
fortunately
the
money
argument
come
up
between
olive
and
me
only
when
we
balance
our
book
and
overall
we
grow
closer
and
closer
in
march
a
little
after
my
thirtieth
birthday
our
son
tom
be
born
we
both
felt
very
lucky
to
have
another
child
work
at
the
pentagon
be
ten
time
the
education
that
ibm
school
have
be
one
of
my
duty
be
to
investigate
case
of
cheat
and
steal
by
air
force
personnel
and
i
learn
a
lot
about
human
nature
include
my
own
for
instance
i
have
no
patience
for
the
fact
that
if
you
didn
t
prove
a
case
from
seventeen
different
direction
a
fellow
could
squeeze
out
on
some
technicality
one
time
i
have
obtain
a
full
confession
and
even
so
the
case
get
overturn
when
the
defense
argue
that
i
have
be
abrasive
and
threaten
i
be
glad
i
hadn
t
try
to
become
a
lawyer
oddly
i
be
much
well
at
investigate
sensitive
matter
such
as
suspicious
damage
to
air
force
plane
or
crash
in
which
high
rank
officer
be
hurt
i
remember
one
tragic
case
involve
an
air
force
general
name
uzal
ent
the
fellow
be
a
real
hero
who
have
lead
a
dare
raid
on
the
ploesti
oil
field
in
rumania
he
be
suppose
to
fly
from
colorado
spring
to
san
antonio
when
his
copilot
get
sick
and
he
ask
the
base
commander
for
a
replacement
they
put
in
a
new
guy
and
ent
didn
t
brief
him
very
thoroughly
when
they
be
make
their
takeoff
run
ent
begin
sing
to
himself
nod
his
head
in
time
to
the
song
the
new
copilot
thought
he
be
call
for
the
land
gear
up
although
normally
the
pilot
would
make
a
gesture
and
say
in
a
loud
voice
gear
up
when
he
saw
ent
bob
his
head
a
second
time
the
copilot
let
the
gear
up
they
be
only
go
seventy
knot
too
slow
to
fly
the
plane
go
down
on
its
belly
and
one
of
the
propeller
on
ent
s
side
separate
from
its
engine
and
walk
up
the
fuselage
a
propeller
blade
cut
into
ent
s
back
and
sever
his
spine
so
that
he
become
a
paraplegic
when
i
take
the
copilot
s
testimony
i
ask
him
if
you
knew
the
plane
wasn
t
go
to
fly
why
do
you
put
the
gear
up
he
be
stupid
he
say
i
thought
the
general
want
me
to
work
on
matter
like
these
brought
me
into
contact
with
hap
arnold
general
bradley
s
bos
arnold
use
me
from
time
to
time
as
his
personal
messenger
on
one
memorable
occasion
he
order
me
to
get
a
bomber
and
offer
harry
truman
a
lift
at
that
time
truman
be
a
senator
in
charge
of
the
committee
that
supervise
war
procurement
he
and
his
colleague
be
play
hob
with
the
air
force
because
it
wasn
t
do
a
very
good
job
manage
airplane
factory
the
committee
would
tour
a
bomber
plant
and
find
plane
stall
on
the
production
line
because
a
single
part
be
in
short
supply
the
next
thing
you
d
know
truman
would
be
blasting
the
air
force
in
the
newspaper
general
arnold
be
not
happy
about
this
and
he
sent
me
to
do
something
about
it
he
told
me
truman
be
visit
his
hometown
of
independence
missouri
so
i
get
a
b
a
two
engine
medium
bomber
that
could
be
flown
safely
by
one
pilot
and
head
out
to
the
midwest
i
finally
tracked
down
truman
at
a
church
supper
from
the
doorway
of
the
meeting
room
i
could
see
a
lot
of
table
arrange
in
a
u
shape
with
the
senator
way
down
at
the
end
it
might
have
be
wiser
to
wait
outside
but
when
the
command
general
of
the
air
force
give
me
an
order
i
obeyed
so
i
squeeze
in
behind
all
those
people
eat
pea
and
chicken
get
up
to
truman
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
he
look
around
and
say
yes
major
sir
i
know
this
be
no
time
to
talk
but
i
have
a
message
from
general
arnold
and
an
airplane
i
wonder
if
i
could
offer
you
a
lift
somewhere
yes
that
would
be
nice
i
m
go
to
chicago
tomorrow
meet
me
at
the
independence
airport
at
ten
i
met
him
there
and
he
be
very
cordial
not
aggressive
by
any
mean
he
be
wear
one
of
those
white
suit
he
like
so
much
and
a
straw
hat
tipped
down
in
front
and
white
shoe
and
sock
a
neat
well
dress
little
midwesterner
mr
truman
and
margaret
have
come
to
see
him
off
and
they
couldn
t
have
be
more
affable
i
take
them
through
the
b
then
he
told
his
family
good
bye
and
i
flew
him
to
chicago
which
be
thrill
for
me
i
felt
proud
to
have
a
u
s
senator
in
my
plane
when
we
land
at
midway
field
i
ask
if
i
could
have
ten
minute
of
his
time
we
go
inside
a
fly
infest
greasy
spoon
restaurant
with
a
soot
cover
screen
door
and
order
coffee
then
he
ask
what
my
mission
be
i
say
sir
the
air
force
be
have
trouble
get
production
to
run
perfectly
but
it
s
not
helpful
to
have
the
truman
committee
always
make
remark
about
us
in
public
the
message
i
bring
you
be
could
you
kind
of
pay
attention
to
the
other
service
and
get
back
to
us
later
he
didn
t
fume
or
fuss
he
say
the
dope
i
have
be
that
your
organization
be
the
bad
of
any
but
tell
general
arnold
i
have
his
message
and
thanks
very
much
i
carry
that
reply
back
to
washington
the
general
like
me
because
i
get
a
lot
do
in
a
short
time
and
write
complete
report
on
what
be
accomplish
i
come
on
pretty
strong
and
press
hard
once
in
a
while
somebody
who
be
full
of
pepper
would
say
now
look
for
god
s
sake
you
ve
only
be
in
this
air
force
for
four
year
and
i
ve
be
in
it
fifteen
so
don
t
think
you
can
push
me
around
at
the
pentagon
there
be
a
lot
of
people
i
didn
t
get
along
with
at
first
old
officer
who
be
only
interested
in
building
bureaucratic
empire
but
as
i
associate
with
more
and
more
different
type
i
realize
that
to
make
it
you
have
to
get
along
with
almost
everybody
if
you
dislike
the
people
you
work
with
you
d
well
not
show
it
i
learn
that
to
be
a
good
leader
i
have
to
strike
a
delicate
balance
it
involve
press
to
a
point
beyond
where
most
people
would
press
but
short
of
where
i
become
know
as
a
troublemaker
if
a
group
have
be
through
a
particularly
tough
period
of
work
i
knew
enough
to
ease
up
and
have
them
all
over
to
our
apartment
with
their
wife
for
a
drink
i
also
knew
that
if
they
hadn
t
have
much
to
do
for
a
long
time
they
would
welcome
a
period
of
intense
activity
right
after
bradley
set
up
the
air
inspector
s
office
in
early
he
be
sent
off
on
a
top
secret
mission
to
england
the
u
s
eighth
air
force
have
start
daylight
bombing
in
europe
they
flew
b
s
packed
in
tight
formation
so
that
theoretically
the
plane
could
protect
one
another
with
their
machine
gun
but
they
be
no
match
for
the
swarm
of
german
fighter
and
the
loss
be
horrendous
bradley
s
mission
be
to
study
the
bombing
result
and
determine
if
the
daylight
raid
be
worthwhile
he
himself
participate
in
raid
over
germany
and
finally
recommend
that
the
daylight
bombing
proceed
but
after
he
make
his
report
he
have
a
heart
attack
from
have
be
at
high
altitude
for
long
period
without
enough
oxygen
he
be
only
fifty
two
but
the
air
force
retire
him
he
take
a
job
with
a
war
contractor
call
sperry
gyroscope
and
i
saw
him
only
sporadically
after
that
i
soon
discover
that
i
work
a
hell
of
a
lot
harder
if
i
like
my
bos
the
new
general
who
come
in
junius
jones
be
the
opposite
of
bradley
a
terrible
fuddy
duddy
he
immediately
try
me
out
as
his
pilot
and
unfortunately
like
the
way
i
flew
he
be
a
very
odd
ball
slow
and
ponderous
without
even
a
spark
of
humor
he
constantly
jingled
the
change
in
his
pocket
which
be
why
he
have
the
nickname
jingle
willie
he
be
old
and
fumbly
and
would
do
the
most
unexpected
thing
in
an
airplane
fly
with
him
be
a
nightmare
he
d
sit
in
the
pilot
s
seat
and
say
what
do
i
do
now
watson
i
have
to
watch
him
all
the
time
once
on
takeoff
he
try
to
yank
a
heavily
load
plane
into
the
air
before
it
be
move
fast
enough
to
fly
that
could
easily
have
kill
us
all
and
i
shove
the
wheel
forward
to
hold
us
on
the
ground
approach
a
land
he
d
say
land
gear
down
watson
and
i
d
point
out
we
re
go
a
hundred
and
eighty
mile
an
hour
general
the
wind
would
tear
the
sheet
metal
fairings
off
the
wheel
if
they
come
down
when
the
plane
be
go
that
fast
finally
i
d
call
out
one
hundred
forty
or
whatever
the
safe
speed
be
and
he
d
say
gear
down
watson
as
if
nothing
have
happen
i
lose
count
of
the
number
of
scrape
i
pull
him
out
of
jones
get
to
depend
on
me
but
he
get
to
dislike
me
too
as
far
as
my
military
career
be
concerned
this
be
disastrous
for
two
full
year
i
get
stuck
as
a
lieutenant
colonel
jones
wouldn
t
promote
me
but
he
wouldn
t
let
me
go
with
bradley
i
never
have
any
doubt
that
what
i
be
do
be
worthwhile
but
under
jones
i
begin
to
feel
i
should
have
push
for
a
combat
assignment
when
i
come
back
from
russia
this
bother
me
all
the
time
i
be
in
washington
and
i
finally
decide
to
do
something
about
it
in
the
middle
of
when
i
go
with
jones
to
inspect
the
most
famous
airlift
of
the
war
japan
have
conquer
burma
and
most
of
the
chinese
coast
essentially
trap
chiang
kai
shek
and
the
nationalist
chinese
in
the
country
s
interior
american
pilot
have
to
fly
supply
for
the
ally
over
the
himalaya
from
the
assam
valley
in
india
to
kunming
in
the
interior
of
china
this
be
call
fly
the
hump
and
the
route
be
the
most
dangerous
imaginable
the
weather
be
violent
horrible
storm
and
freakish
wind
that
could
flip
an
airplane
upside
down
the
airplane
themselves
be
unreliable
at
high
altitude
the
engine
would
ice
up
and
stop
or
catch
fire
so
many
plane
crashed
on
one
stretch
of
ground
that
it
be
call
the
aluminum
trail
the
plane
that
make
it
over
often
have
to
face
japanese
fighter
on
the
other
side
but
in
spite
of
the
danger
the
pilot
would
sometimes
fly
two
round
trip
over
the
hump
in
a
day
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
their
heroic
effort
the
war
would
have
be
over
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
we
would
have
lose
the
six
air
station
in
the
assam
valley
have
gravel
runway
and
be
unbelievably
primitive
only
one
of
them
date
from
before
the
war
the
rest
have
be
scratch
out
of
the
ground
after
the
hump
airlift
start
in
and
we
saw
more
that
be
still
be
built
the
worker
be
civilian
whole
family
draft
from
tea
plantation
and
they
have
almost
no
construction
equipment
woman
make
the
gravel
for
the
runway
by
chip
large
rock
with
hammer
and
you
d
see
them
carry
it
in
basket
on
their
head
to
the
construction
site
the
runway
be
crude
and
bumpy
but
a
welcome
sight
to
pilot
some
of
these
air
station
be
undisciplined
with
sloppy
quarter
and
high
disease
rate
but
they
be
succeed
in
move
thousand
of
ton
of
supply
to
keep
the
plane
in
the
air
the
mechanic
have
to
provide
a
level
of
maintenance
that
be
practically
impossible
in
such
a
rough
place
and
they
work
around
the
clock
to
do
it
i
saw
men
change
engine
in
degree
heat
in
the
open
sun
and
do
major
overhaul
in
wind
and
rain
when
we
get
to
the
assam
valley
the
monsoon
be
just
begin
but
that
make
no
difference
to
flight
operation
plane
take
off
and
land
for
sixteen
hour
each
day
under
low
sky
and
in
heavy
downpour
it
wasn
t
part
of
my
official
duty
but
at
the
first
opportunity
i
push
myself
onto
a
mission
over
the
hump
i
d
heard
so
much
about
its
terror
and
difficulty
that
i
felt
i
owe
it
to
myself
and
the
army
to
find
out
what
the
pilot
be
up
against
the
pilot
i
go
with
be
a
young
captain
name
carpenter
who
be
take
four
ton
of
oil
to
kunming
i
flew
as
copilot
we
wore
oxygen
mask
heavy
boot
and
parachute
we
have
silk
map
that
show
how
to
walk
out
if
we
get
shot
down
and
money
belt
so
we
could
trade
with
the
native
the
route
we
be
assign
involve
a
four
hour
trip
two
of
those
hour
behind
japanese
line
we
take
off
in
dark
and
rain
before
dawn
and
clear
the
high
ridge
fly
at
twenty
one
thousand
foot
on
instrument
use
oxygen
mask
on
the
way
up
after
daybreak
we
could
see
patch
of
ground
below
but
fortunately
there
be
enough
cloud
to
help
us
hide
from
japanese
fighter
for
the
third
time
i
thrill
at
the
sight
of
china
even
though
this
part
be
held
by
the
japanese
i
could
see
little
isolated
valley
beneath
us
with
every
inch
of
ground
under
the
most
intensive
cultivation
and
neat
cluster
of
thatch
hut
we
land
at
kunming
on
a
runway
where
cooly
be
constantly
at
work
refill
hole
from
the
japanese
bombardment
we
deliver
our
oil
and
then
carpenter
take
me
to
a
very
primitive
restaurant
at
the
edge
of
the
field
a
chinese
guy
ran
it
and
when
he
saw
us
come
he
say
eggis
eggis
i
ask
carpenter
what
the
hell
do
that
mean
he
mean
egg
it
be
all
the
restaurant
have
to
serve
i
ate
egg
and
egg
and
egg
eight
of
them
i
guess
fear
have
make
me
hungry
on
the
way
back
to
india
carpenter
let
me
fly
i
make
a
textbook
land
when
we
reach
assam
and
it
give
me
a
triumphant
feel
to
know
that
i
d
be
over
the
hump
undeniably
it
could
be
the
bad
fly
route
in
the
world
yet
i
thought
i
could
handle
it
that
night
i
get
carry
away
and
enthusiastically
imagine
myself
command
one
of
the
air
station
in
the
assam
valley
participate
in
the
contest
among
station
to
see
which
could
put
the
most
ton
over
the
hump
each
month
after
a
couple
of
day
i
go
back
to
kunming
sought
out
general
claire
chennault
the
commander
of
the
fourteenth
air
force
and
ask
for
combat
duty
chennault
be

but
when
old
jingle

get
wind
of
it
about
a
week
later
he

other
idea
i
ve
have
a
request
for
you
he
told
me
but
i
ve
turn
it
down
because
you
re
too
important
here
i
suppose
i
could
have
pursue
it
far
but
in
the
interim
i
d
push
my
way
onto
another
combat
flight
as
an
observer
and
it
have
scar
me
enough
to
last
the
whole
war
it
be
a
medical
evacuation
flight
over
a
new
route
that
follow
a
series
of
mountain
pass
into
burma
this
parallel
the
so
call
ledo
road
and
it
be
expect
to
become
a
major
airlift
route
low
and
less
dangerous
to
fly
than
the
hump
it
lead
to
a
jungle
airfield
that
have
just
be
capture
by
american
and
chinese
troop
under
general
vinegar
joe
stilwell
he
be
the
senior
american
general
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
tactician
who
be
suppose
to
train
and
equip
the
chinese
and
urge
them
onward
in
the
fight
against
japan
in
the
japanese
have
crush
stilwell
s
army
and
chase
him
out
of
burma
but
now
he
be
back
on
the
attack
there
be
a
major
battle
go
on
for
the
town
of
myitkyina
around
which
several
thousand
japanese
be
dug
in
stilwell
have
large
number
of
wound
as
well
as
men
critically
sick
with
dysentery
and
typhus
they
all
have
to
be
take
out
the
pilot
a
lieutenant
taylor
told
me
he
d
be
convict
of
sell
black
market
cigarette
and
have
be
assign
to
fly
this
route
for
another
year
as
his
punishment
we
take
off
in
weather
that
would
have
be
consider
unflyable
in
the
state
a
ceiling
of
three
hundred
foot
with
one
mile
visibility
when
he
and
his
copilot
take
us
up
the
first
valley
we
be
fly
so
low
that
accord
to
the
elevation
on
the
map
we
be
fly
underground
the
only
reassure
thing
be
the
uncanny
way
taylor
knew
where
we
be
every
few
minute
he
d
tell
me
that
a
road
or
a
hamlet
be
just
ahead
and
it
would
turn
up
exactly
as
he
have
say
but
as
we
get
into
the
narrow
part
of
the
pas
we
ran
into
solid
fog
we
be
fly
at
less
than
a
hundred
foot
and
i
be
sure
the
end
have
come
i
curl
up
behind
taylor
s
seat
and
brace
for
the
crash
taylor
say
what
the
hell
you
want
to
live
forever
we
clear
a
final
ridge
in
heavy
rain
and
after
that
the
cloud
be
at
about
four
hundred
foot
and
we
stayed
below
them
i
watch
a
very
green
lush
flat
valley
rush
by
and
notice
a
number
of
wreck
dc
s
that
have
be
shot
down
which
be
far
from
reassure
finally
we
start
to
circle
and
i
say
how
can
you
tell
where
the
battle
line
be
taylor
say
well
they
keep
change
but
the
japanese
only
have
small
arm
to
shoot
at
us
with
so
don
t
worry
at
last
we
land
we
be
so
close
to
the
line
that
i
could
hear
small
arm
fire
which
make
me
awfully
jumpy
suddenly
right
behind
me
there
be
a
tremendous
whoom
and
i
dove
for
cover
only
to
see
that
nobody
else
do
i
hadn
t
notice
that
i
d
be
stand
right
next
to
a
camouflage
mm
cannon
the
field
hospital
be
run
by
a
doctor
name
gordon
seagrave
a
friendly
kindly
man
who
d
spent
twenty
year
in
burma
as
a
missionary
doctor
before
the
war
now
he
be
in
the
u
s
army
and
have
just
write
a
successful
book
call
burma
surgeon
seagrave
s
hospital
be
cut
into
the
side
of
a
hill
with
a
crude
grass
roof
the
only
protection
all
around
be
wound
men
cover
with
jungle
mud
and
blood
and
bug
a
terrible
sight
and
terrible
smell
but
somehow
seagrave
kept
the
infection
rate
very
low
we
have
to
load
the
stretcher
ourselves
because
the
soldier
on
the
field
be
too
demoralize
to
help
those
wound
be
the
most
move
sight
i
d
ever
see
an
emaciate
blond
boy
with
the
look
of
a
hunt
animal
who
have
lose
his
unit
and
wander
for
week
in
the
jungle
a
huge
beard
man
who
be
painfully
wound
in
the
leg
but
kept
up
the
morale
of
the
others
with
his
constant
smile
and
conversation
other
pitifully
hurt
men
fight
for
their
life
with
abdominal
wound
brain
injury
jungle
fever
the
smell
and
fly
in
the
hot
cabin
be
overwhelm
i
kept
gag
and
finally
go
forward
to
the
flight
deck
out
of
embarrassment
that
day
we
evacuate
twenty
eight
men
in
two
trip
see
these
men
i
could
understand
why
pilot
be
willing
to
fly
through
hell
to
give
them
help
but
as
much
as
i
admire
the
courage
of
men
like
lieutenant
taylor
that
flight
be
enough
for
me
i
wasn
t
sorry
to
leave
the
assam
valley
behind
and
to
head
back
to
the
mediterranean
where
the
war
be
mostly
won
by
now
we
inspect
base
in
north
africa
and
along
the
adriatic
coast
of
italy
and
then
flew
over
to
rome
fly
across
italy
just
a
little
north
of
monte
cassino
we
pass
over
steep
rugged
terrain
where
the
fifth
and
eighth
army
have
face
their
toughest
fight
the
winter
before
in
that
section
of
italy
most
of
the
town
be
on
the
peak
of
the
mountain
and
every
town
we
saw
have
be
badly
bombed
we
land
outside
rome
and
on
the
drive
into
the
city
we
pass
the
sight
of
many
wreck
german
mm
antiaircraft
gun
rome
itself
have
be
spar
by
allied
german
agreement
and
the
people
look
neater
and
the
girl
prettier
than
any
i
d
see
since
leave
the
state
we
stayed
at
a
hotel
that
have
be

camp
and
have
a
bath
and
a
good
dinner
on
an
open
terrace
listen
to
viennese
music
and
the
yell
of
merrymaking
soldier
on
the
street
the
next
day
i
found
myself

up

or
watson
italiana

in
the
telephone

go
there
and
see
what
the
situation
be
the
office

in
an
excellent
location

through
a
very
bare
showroom
into
the
office
of
giuseppe
samarughi
the
manager
whom
i
d
met
once
in
new
york
he
shook
my
hand
warmly
and
then
an
american
major
who
be
also
there

and
now
in
charge
of
all
the
punch
card
record
in
the
mediterranean
theater
he
told
me
he
d
be
try
to
look
after
this
office
since
the
liberation
of
rome
amazingly
rent
be
still
come
in
from
customer
around
the
area
but
deal
with
the
occupation
authority
be
a
big
headache
like
all
the
business
in
rome
watson
italiana
have
be
take
over
by
the
american
military
government
and
they
weren
t
let
mr
samarughi
run
the
office
the
way
it
need
to
be
run
i
really
have
no
authority
to
act
but
samarughi
and
ritterbush
seem
to
expect
it
of
me
maybe
i
d
become
more
decisive
in
general
or
maybe
for
that
one
instant
i
be
ready
to
get
back
to
ibm
in
any
case
i
head
straight
for
the
military
governor
s
office
where
i
give
assurance
that
ibm
equipment
be
american
and
not
alien
property
i
stayed
there
until
the
logjam
be
broken
and
they
agree
to
put
samarughi
back
in
charge
then
i
give
him
responsibility
for
all
of
italy
until
milan
could
be
liberate
and
the
regular
country
head
could
take
over
samarughi
be
very
grateful
and
as
a
keepsake
present
me
with
a
beretta
pistol
it
be
a
neat
little
weapon
of
the
type
carry
by
italian
officer
i
accepted
it
even
though
it
cross
my
mind
that
gun
like
it
have
be
use
to
kill
american
boy
general
jones
didn
t
want
to
leave
the
mediterranean
without
take
a
short
holiday
on
the
island
of
capri
after
all
the
destruction
we
have
see
the
beauty
of
the
deep
blue
water
and
the
seaside
villa
built
amid
spire
of
rock
be
almost
shock
on
the
beach
i
met
an
italian
marchesa
who
invite
my
colleague
and
me
to
a
party
that
night
we
be
the
only
american

whole
crowd

me
as
deprave
there
be
beautiful
italian
lady
accompany
by
men
who
look
like
international
loafer
and
i
dance
with
a
wealthy
swiss
woman
who
told
me
in
all
seriousness
that
she
be
sweat

capri
i
left

party
feel
glad
to
be
an
american
serviceman
on
the
way
back
to
washington
i
begin
to
think
seriously
about
what
i
would
do
after
the
war
it
be
clear
that
an
allied
victory
be
come
even
though
it
would
take
a
while
in
spite
of
what
i
d
do
for
mr
samarughi
the
idea
of
join
the
rank
of
my
father
s
men
didn
t
appeal
to
me
by
now

d
gotten
use
to
the
satisfaction
of
accomplish
thing
on
my
own
and
i
love
the
daily
thrill
of
fly
so
i
decide
that

i
be
terribly

he
told
fred
nichol
to
help
me

up

in
civil

nichol

and
to
my
surprise
dad
didn
t
object
when
i
talk
about
buying
it
he
wasn
t
apply
any
pressure
at
all
but
nichol
s
eagerness
to
find
me
something
outside
ibm
make
me
wonder
what
i
be
passing
up
which
be
probably
the
effect
dad
intend
in
the
spring
of
i
be
back
in
washington
and
ask
general
bradley
who
be
now
a
vice
president
at
sperry
gyroscope
and
visit
washington
on
a
business
trip
to
come
to
our
apartment
and
have
dinner
with
olive
and
me
i
wait
for
him
at
the
pentagon
and
when
he
emerge
lead
him
to
my
car
and
start
the
drive
home
more
than
a
year
have
go
by
since
his
retirement
and
we
d
only
spoken
a
couple
of
time
but
our
conversation
on
the
road
in
the
twilight
of
that
spring
day
be
rivet
in
my
mind
because
it
completely
change
my
life
he
say
tom
what
be
you
go
to
do
when
the
war
be
over
well
general
i
ve
get
a
job
line
up
that
i
think
i
m
go
to
take
i
m
go
to
be
a
pilot
with
united
air
line
i
expect
bradley
to
say
that
s
a
good
choice
and
maybe
compliment
me
on
my
fly
instead
he
say
really
i
always
thought
you
d
go
back
and
run
the
ibm
company
i
be
stun
i
concentrate
on
drive
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
i
ask
the
question
i
suppose
have
be
bury
in
my
mind
from
the
time
i
get
up
from
the
curb
as
a
boy
and
go
home
cry
general
bradley
i
say
do
you
think
i
could
run
ibm
and
he
say
of
course
i
kept
go
over
and
over
the
conversation
as
i
mixed
drink
and
carry
dish
back
and
forth
at
dinner
after
i
take
the
general
back
to
his
hotel
i
park
on
an
untraveled
road
and
sat
behind
the
wheel
for
half
an
hour
try
to
evaluate
what
he
d
say
since
he
have
make
his
point
in
a
conversation
that
be
thoughtful
on
both
side
i
conclude
that
he
have
indeed
meant
it
the
next
question
be
whether
or
not
his
opinion
be
important
enough
for
me
to
act
on
it
bradley
be
by
no
mean
an
easy
man
to
serve
he
be
a
great
leader
but
he
have
his
up
and
down
mood
and
i
hadn
t
always
perform
in
an
exemplary
fashion
for
him
but
in
spite
of
this
he
have
high
respect
for
my
ability
this
make
me
think
that
i
might
be
sell
myself
short
by
go
to
united
air
line
or
anywhere
else
but
ibm
i
say
to
olive
when
i
get
home
general
bradley
think
i
could
run
ibm
she
be
silent
for
so
long
that
i
say
olive
what
do
you
think
she
say
tom
you
re
a
fun
love
boy
and
it
s
hard
to
believe
you
really
want
to
do
it
but
when
you
put
your
mind
to
something
i
ve
never
see
you
fail
i
conclude
that
bradley
s
word
must
be
true
it
amaze
me
how
much
i
d
change
in
the
air
force
my
attitude
have
improve
dramatically
and
my
energy
level
have
greatly
increase
i
d
realize
that
i
have
the
force
of
personality
to
get
my
idea
across
to
others
as
long
as
i
take
the
time
beforehand
to
think
thing
through
i
be
sure
of
my
ability
to
speak
in
public
and
write
clearly
these
be
all
strength
that
have
developed
under
bradley
he
be
my
bridge
to
self
confidence
twenty
four
hour
later
my
mind
be
make
up
and
i
start
planning
a
trip
to
new
york
i
call
my
old
man
and
say
i
d
like
to
come
up
on
a
workday
and
meet
the
people
there
because
to
be
honest
with
you
i
may
be
come
back
to
ibm
if
you
will
have
me
of
course
this
be
something
he
d
be
wait
for
year
to
hear
and
there
be
warmth
and
happiness
in
his
voice
as
he
say
simply
i
d
be
delighted
son
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
for
certain
if
my
father
be
clearing
the
way
for
me
but
when
i
go
up
to
ibm
that
spring
to
look
thing
over
i
could
see
that
the
prospective
competition
for
the
top
job
wasn
t
great
ibm
be
boom
along
but
the
executive
office
in
new
york
be
oddly
empty
a
lot
of
the
old
guard
who
d
be
with
dad
from
the
begin
have
retire
and
as
they
drop
by
the
wayside
he
hadn
t
replace
them
as
rapidly
as
he
might
before
the
war
there
be
some
bright
hard
drive
fifty
year
old
manager
buck
for
those
senior
job
but
when
i
get
back
these
hotshot
be
go
they
d
take
job
elsewhere
or
go
into
business
for
themselves
and
unimpressive
men
be
in
their
place
i
never
found
out
why
at
the
time
i
honestly
thought
there
be
something
magical
about
it
i
remember
think
gee
maybe
i
ve
get
a
chance
here
after
that
i
have
to
leave
on
another
long
inspection
tour
with
general
jones
all
over
the
south
pacific
by
the
middle
of
august
we
have
gotten
all
the
way
to
sydney
australia
and
i
be
drowse
in
my
hotel
room
half
listen
to
the
radio
when
a
british
announcer
say
the
japanese
have
surrender
unconditionally
i
ran
onto
the
street
and
dance
with
an
australian
nurse
four
year
of
war
five
year
of
the
army
and
now
victory
the
news
be
hard
to
believe
but
it
give
me
a
delicious
weak
kneed
feel
by
lunchtime
there
be
eighteen
people
in
my
little
room
sing
and
dance
the
street
in
front
of
the
hotel
be
crowd
with
cheer
throng
and
i
only
saw
a
few
people
who
be
not
deliriously
happy
perhaps
those
who
have
lose
love
one
and
knew
the
cost
of
the
prize
we
d
won
within
a
few
day
we
be
on
our
way
home
fly
from
hawaii
to
san
francisco
in
the
middle
of
the
night
general
jones
be
sound
asleep
and
i
be
at
the
control
all
told
in
my
five
year
i
d
flown
about
twenty
five
hundred
hour
fifteen
hundred
of
them
either
over
the
sea
or
close
to
enemy
territory
and
finally
the
war
be
over
i
remember
the
beauty
of
the
full
moon
on
the
scatter
cumulus
cloud
two
thousand
foot
below
us
as
i
sat
listen
to
a
honolulu
radio
station
play
a
symphony
and
in
the
background
the
sing
of
our
engine
i
thought
of
how
olive
would
have
enjoy
that
scene
the
way
at
ibm
seem
clear
for
me
and
i
never
have
anything
in
mind
but
to
aim
for
the
top
job
but
i
come
home
from
the
south
pacific
in
september
to
a
terrible
shock
dad
have
replace
fred
nichol
with
a
new
number
two
man
a
smart
hard
drive
executive
name
charley
kirk
i
d
never
take
fred
nichol
very
seriously
he
d
start
out
as
dad
s
secretary
just
like
george
phillips
he
be
the
kind
of
fellow
to
whom
dad
could
say
why
don
t
we
build
a
tower
to
the
moon
and
nichol
would
say
yes
sir
i
ll
order
the
steel
this
afternoon
charley
kirk
be
a
different
story
he
be
only
forty
one
a
prodigious
worker
aggressive
and
yet
very
popular
with
the
men
he
come
from
a
rough
background
somewhat
like
dad
s
and
he
d
make
his
reputation
as
a
supersalesman
in
our
st
louis
office
when
the
war
come
dad
brought
him
to
endicott
where
kirk
be
in
charge
of
the
rapid
and
successful
expansion
of
the
plant
i
never
expect
to
have
to
contend
with
kirk
at
headquarters
in
my
mind
he
be
the
factory
bos
who
belong
up
in
endicott
but
the
anxiety
of
work
for
dad
finally
take
its
toll
on
poor
nichol
in
the
spring
of
he
have
a
nervous
breakdown
and
after
a
few
month
he
retire
at
age
fifty
eight
when
it
become
clear
that
nichol
wasn
t
come
back
dad
brought
kirk
down
from
endicott
promote
him
to
executive
vice
president
and
give
him
a
seat
on
the
board
this
be
hard
for
me
to
understand
i
guess
dad
still
seem
so
self
sufficient
to
me
that
i
couldn
t
appreciate
why
he
need
a
number
two
but
one
thing
i
later
learn
about
manage
a
company
be
that
it
s
like
try
to
run
a
family
with
a
lot
of
child
too
many
thing
need
do
you
want
to
get
the
factory
go
right
you
want
the
sale
to
go
up
you
want
to
motivate
this
guy
put
a
well
fellow
in
that
job
you
have
a
list
on
your
desk
and
the
item
be
all
hard
to
accomplish
if
you
have
a
man
like
kirk
you
can
show
him
your
list
and
he
ll
say
let
me
handle
these
four
thing
that
have
a
powerful
appeal
for
a
harry
executive
such
as
dad
who
by
then
be
in
his
seventy
but
all
i
could
think
of
be
that
if
dad
ever
get
sick
or
die
kirk
be
the
logical
successor
i
left
the
air
force
at
the
end
of
and
on
the
first
business
day
of
i
report
to
ibm
dad
greet
me
in
his
office
i
have
on
a
stiff
paper
collar
and
a
good
dark
suit
he
shook
my
hand
and
gesture
toward
the
other
end
of
the
room
tom
he
say
you
ve
met
charley
kirk
then
dad
told
me
i
be
go
to
be
kirk
s
assistant
i
m
sure
i
shook
kirk
s
hand
and
say
how
glad
i
be
but
i
be
so
surprised
that
i
don
t
remember
do
it
it
take
several
day
for
me
to
sort
out
how
i
felt
about
this
assignment
i
knew
it
wasn
t
as
demean
as
it
might
sound
because
the
title
of
assistant
have
a
special
meaning
at
ibm
dad
always
preach
the
idea
that
executive
and
manager
should
see
themselves
not
as
boss
of
employee
but
as
their
assistant
and
he
often
make
promising
young
men
assistant
to
the
top
people
so
there
be
no
stigma
in
be
an
assistant
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
i
d
be
work
with
kirk
and
not
with
dad
really
bother
me
by
the
end
of
the
follow
week
it
be
clear
to
me
that
the
two
men
have
form
a
tight
bond
kirk
and
i
go
up
to
endicott
where
dad
have
order
a
week
long
meeting
for
all
of
ibm
s
sale
manager
conference
like
this
be
call
executive
school
at
ibm
and
this
be
the
first
big
one
since
the
end
of
the
war
kirk
ran
it
and
dad
didn
t
show
up
until
wednesday
when
he
come
in
he
sat
down
in
the
back
of
the
assembly
hall
at
the
podium
make
a
presentation
be
one
of
ibm
s
young
branch
manager
a
close
friend
of
kirk
s
from
st
louis
by
the
name
of
jim
birkenstock
i
saw
dad
beckon
for
kirk
to
join
him
at
the
rear
and
the
two
of
them
put
their
head
together
and
talk
quietly
behind
their
hand
suddenly
dad
say
dramatically
mr
kirk
that
man
on
the
platform
be
so
impressive
that
he
will
be
our
new
general
sale
manager
i
be
go
to
make
the
announcement
right
now
there
be
a
gasp
from
the
people
who
heard
this
because
birkenstock
have
thereby
leap
from
a
junior
position
to
become
practically
everyone
s
bos
and
with
his
new
job
go
a
twenty
thousand
dollar
a
year
salary
so
dad
make
the
announcement
while
kirk
take
birkenstock
s
predecessor
aside
and
told
him
he
d
have
to
shift
to
another
job
dad
be
know
for
give
unexpected
promotion
but
this
be
unheard
of
i
take
it
as
an
indication
of
kirk
s
great
influence
on
my
father
i
have
to
hand
it
to
kirk
that
from
the
moment
we
get
back
to
new
york
he
treat
me
fairly
and
go
flat
out
to
teach
me
the
business
he
have
a
large
desk
in
his
office
and
he
simply
told
me
to
pull
up
a
chair
alongside
i
don
t
have
time
to
explain
everything
i
do
he
say
but
you
ll
learn
if
you
sit
here
and
watch
that
be
where
i
perch
every
day
for
month
and
whenever
kirk
go
out
to
a
meeting
i
d
go
along
i
saw
practically
everything
he
do
i
learn
how
to
make
decision
for
kirk
be
excellent
at
make
them
fast
and
make
most
of
them
right
when
you
have
his
kind
of
experience
and
feel
for
a
business
you
can
make
very
rapid
decision
particularly
where
you
can
forecast
the
result
but
he
also
knew
when
to
not
go
pell
mell
for
example
on
a
matter
that
if
handle
wrong
could
hurt
ibm
s
reputation
or
provoke
a
lawsuit
at
this
point
charley
be
handle
dozen
of
different
responsibility
i
d
never
see
such
a
prodigious
worker
sit
by
kirk
i
have
as
good
a
cross
section
view
of
ibm
s
problem
as
i
could
have
gotten
anywhere
in
the
company
even
so
friendship
between
kirk
and
me
didn
t
seem
to
be
in
the
card
one
night
early
on
he
invite
me
up
to
his
place
with
three
or
four
ibmers
all
friend
of
his
he
have
a
room
at
the
ritz
tower
because
he
still
hadn
t
have
time
to
move
his
family
down
from
endicott
after
we
sat
down
kirk
pull
out
a
bottle
toss
it
on
the
bed
and
say
have
a
drink
tom
i
say
no
thanks
they
all
pull
back
a
bit
at
that
charley
especially
he
knew
that
i
d
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
nightclub
before
the
war
what
he
didn
t
know
be
that
around
the
middle
of
i
d
decide
that
my
career
would
be
well
serve
if
i
completely
give
up
drinking
even
social
drinking
look
i
say
it
s
no
reflection
on
any
of
you
it
s
after
hour
but
at
the
moment
i
don
t
drink
a
drop
that
make
me
the
odd
man
out
everyone
else
have
a
drink
and
start
talk
about
old
time
in
st
louis
and
i
left
ibm
s
situation
in
those
day
be
enough
to
make
anybody
want
a
drink
like
hundred
of
other
business
we
have
to
switch
as
fast
as
possible
from
wartime
to
peacetime
production
dad
have
no
intention
of
shrink
ibm
back
down
to
its
prewar
size
that
would
have
meant
fire
his
new
employee
sell
the
new
factory
he
be
so
proud
of
and
closing
the
door
on
some
of
the
return
veteran
to
whom
he
felt
a
deep
obligation
yet
two
third
of
our
factory
space
be
devote
to
make
war
mat
riel
and
that
market
disappear
the
day
america
won
so
how
be
we
suppose
to
keep
all
the
employee
busy
and
the
factory
full
somehow
ibm
be
go
to
have
to
sell
three
time
as
many
business
machine
as
before
the
war
dad
be
surely
one
of
the
most
positive
think
and
optimistic
businessmen
who
ever
live
but
even
he
worried
about
this
one
there
be
a
record
of
a
meeting
in
where
he
be
already
lean
on
his
engineer
to
develop
new
product
for
peacetime
suppose
the
war
in
europe
end
in
three
month
he
say
what
can
we
go
out
and
take
order
for
that
we
be
not
take
order
for
now
the
engineer
call
off
the
name
of
machine
be
developed
but
dad
say
none
of
them
open
up
new
field
what
i
have
get
to
look
for
be
new
business
he
say
otherwise
there
be
no
use
in
talk
about
keep
all
those
people
employ
full
time
gentleman
it
be
easy
to
say
but
hard
to
do
and
i
lose
a
lot
of
sleep
last
night
just
think
about
how
we
be
go
to
do
it
dad
told
the
engineer
that
from
then
on
they
would
have
to
work
a
lot
faster
before
the
war
it
wasn
t
unusual
for
new
ibm
product
to
take
five
year
from
conception
to
market
but
dad
point
out
that
with
machine
gun
something
totally
new
to
ibm
the
company
have
go
from
a
stand
start
to
full
production
in
a
matter
of
month
if
we
can
do
it
on
the
gun
he
say
we
can
do
it
on
this
apparatus
that
we
know
something
about
he
wasn
t
just
be
arbitrary
somehow
he
sense
correctly
that
because
of
the
war
the
pace
of
technological
change
in
american
life
have
permanently
accelerate
one
of
the
thing
keep
dad
awake
at
night
must
have
be
the
memory
of
the
year
when
the
u
s
economy
contract
after
world
war
i
and
ctr
almost
go
bankrupt
i
m
sure
he
also
have
unhappy
vision
of
the
hundred
and
hundred
of
accounting
machine
on
rental
to
the
u
s
arm
force
most
of
this
equipment
would
be
turn
back
to
ibm
defense
contractor
who
have
built
up
for
the
war
and
now
have
to
cut
back
couldn
t
be
count
on
to
keep
all
their
machine
either
so
unless
we
could
find
army
of
new
customer
our
warehouse
be
go
to
fill
up
with
use
machine
earn
no
money
and
our
factory
would
have
nothing
to
do
in
the
face
of
possible
calamity
dad
s
impulse
be
always
to
hire
more
salesman
that
s
just
what
he
propose
around
the
time
i
come
back
from
the
war
he
be
determine
that
ibm
should
have
an
office
in
every
state
capital
and
everybody
from
kirk
on
down
be
scramble
to
expand
the
sale
network
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
the
midst
of
this
we
get
hit
unexpectedly
with
an
avalanche
of
order
for
our
product
the
postwar
recession
never
materialize
instead
the
u
s
economy
boom
because
of
a
huge
pent
up
demand
for
consumer
good
that
nobody
have
be
able
to
buy
during
the
war
car
house
appliance
and
clothing
this
in
turn
boost
support
industry
like
banking
insurance
and
retailing
our
big
customer
all
of
them
suddenly
have
rapidly
grow
record
keep
and
accounting
need
we
quickly
found
ourselves
in
a
race
to
keep
up
with
demand
by
the
time
i
join
kirk
be
work
sixteen
hour
day
the
first
business
trip
i
take
with
kirk
could
well
have
change
the
course
of
computer
industry
history
if
either
of
us
have
understood
what
be
in
front
of
our
nose
it
be
a
gray
day
in
march
and
we
go
to
visit
the
eniac
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
this
be
one
of
the
first
computer
a
giant
primitive
number
cruncher
for
solve
scientific
problem
it
have
just
go
into
operation
make
a
big
name
for
its
inventor
presper
eckert
and
john
mauchly
they
broke
new
ground
by
use
electronic
circuit
instead
of
electromechanical
relay
like
the
one
in
our
tabulate
machine
dad
be
very
big
on
support
project
like
eniac
more
for
prestige
and
philanthropic
motif
than
commercial
one
during
the
war
ibm
and
harvard
university
have
built
a
gigantic
non
electronic
computer
call
the
mark
i
it
consist
pretty
much
of
two
ton
of
ibm
tabulate
machine
synchronize
on
a
single
axle
like
loom
in
a
textile
mill
the
mark
i
get
a
lot
of
attention
as
harvard
s
robot
super
brain
and
be
use
successfully
on
top
secret
war
problem
dad
heard
about
eckert
and
mauchly
late
in
the
war
when
the
navy
ask
ibm
to
supply
punch
card
equipment
to
assist
in
get
data
in
and
out
of
the
eniac
that
give
kirk
and
me
an
entree
but
go
to
see
eniac
be
really
kirk
s
idea
he
be
curious
because
there
be
so
much
publicity
about
eniac
s
ability
to
make
lightning
fast
calculation
another
reason
he
want
to
have
a
look
be
that
eckert
and
mauchly
be
talk
about
filing
a
patent
cause
our
lawyer
to
worry
that
ibm
would
have
to
pay
big
royalty
if
the
idea
of
electronic
compute
ever
go
anywhere
i
remember
the
eniac
vividly
it
be
make
up
of
what
seem
like
acre
of
vacuum
tube
in
metal
rack
the
air
be
very
hot
and
i
ask
eckert
a
trim
urbane
man
why
that
be
he
explain
because
we
be
share
this
room
with
eighteen
thousand
radio
tube
they
hadn
t
air
condition
it
i
ask
what
the
machine
be
do
and
eckert
say
compute
ballistic
trajectory
to
show
us
what
he
meant
he
sat
down
with
a
pencil
and
paper
and
drew
the
curve
an
artillery
shell
follow
through
the
air
he
explain
that
to
make
maximum
use
of
a
gun
you
have
to
be
able
to
calculate
where
its
shell
would
be
at
every
fraction
of
a
second
of
its
flight
this
require
a
tremendous
amount
of
computation
and
eniac
be
do
it
in
a
very
short
time
less
time
in
fact
than
it
would
take
an
actual
shell
to
reach
its
target
that
impressed
me
eckert
go
on
to
tell
me
that
computer
be
the
wave
of
the
future
he
didn
t
quite
call
our
punch
card
machine
dinosaur
but
he
say
he
and
mauchly
be
go
to
take
the
eniac
patent
and
go
into
business
as
he
talk
i
get
the
impression
that
they
thought
they
be
go
to
push
ibm
aside
pretty
quickly
i
say
it
s
a
great
idea
you
have
but
you
re
go
to
run
out
of
money
building
these
thing
for
customer
be
go
to
be
very
expensive
the
truth
be
that
i
react
to
eniac
the
way
some
people
probably
react
to
the
wright
brother
airplane
it
didn
t
move
me
at
all
i
can
t
imagine
why
i
didn
t
think
good
god
that
s
the
future
of
the
ibm
company
but
frankly
i
couldn
t
see
this
gigantic
costly
unreliable
device
as
a
piece
of
business
equipment
kirk
felt
the
same
way
on
the
train
from
philadelphia
back
to
new
york
he
say
well
that
s
awfully
unwieldy
we
could
never
use
anything
like
that
we
both
agree
that
even
though
electronics
innovation
like
radar
be
attract
a
lot
of
popular
attention
this
eniac
be
an
interest
experiment
way
off
on
the
sideline
that
couldn
t
possibly
affect
us
i
never
stop
to
think
what
would
happen
if
the
speed
of
electronic
circuit
could
be
harness
for
commercial
use
fortunately
this
myopia
be
only
temporary
a
few
week
later
my
father
and
i
be
wander
around
ibm
headquarters
dad
always
like
to
nose
around
the
office
when
he
have
spare
time
that
afternoon
i
happen
to
be
along
in
a
part
of
the
building
i
d
never
see
before
we
come
upon
a
door
label
patent
development
inside
be
one
of
dad
s
engineer
who
have
a
high
speed
punch
card
machine
hooked
up
to
a
box
with
black
metal
cover
it
look
like
a
suitcase
only
it
be
about
four
foot
high
i
say
what
be
this
do
and
the
engineer
told
me
multiply
with
radio
tube
the
machine
be
tabulate
a
payroll
a
common
application
for
punch
card
wage
time
number
of
hour
work
less
social
security
deduction
retirement
medical
deduction
and
so
forth
and
come
out
to
net
pay
for
each
worker
then
the
engineer
told
me
how
fast
the
machine
be
work
it
do
its
calculation
in
one
tenth
of
the
time
it
take
the
punch
card
machine
to
punch
out
the
answer
and
go
on
to
the
next
card
the
box
spent
nine
tenth
of
its
time
wait
because
the
electronics
be
so
fast
and
the
mechanic
so
slow
that
impressed
me
as
though
somebody
have
hit
me
on
the
head
with
a
hammer
because
the
multiplier
look
like
a
relatively
simple
device
i
left
that
room
and
say
it
s
fantastic
what
that
thing
s
do
it
s
multiply
and
come
out
with
total
and
do
it
all
with
tube
dad
we
should
put
this
thing
on
the
market
even
if
we
only
sell
eight
or
ten
we
ll
be
able
to
advertise
the
fact
that
we
have
the
world
s
first
commercial
electronic
calculator
that
be
how
ibm
get
into
electronics
in
september
we
announce
the
machine
with
a
full
page
ad
in
the
new
york
time
we
call
it
the
ibm
electronic
multiplier
technically
speak
it
wasn
t
a
computer
it
have
no
store
program
and
process
number
only
as
they
be
fed
in
from
punch
card
in
fact
the
be
mainly
a
gimmick
it
could
calculate
at
electronic
speed
but
that
be
not
very
useful
because
the
punch
card
couldn
t
keep
up
but
in
spite
of
this
the
thing
caught
on
we
be
hop
to
rent
out
a
handful
enough
to
justify
the
expense
of
the
ad
but
big
customer
be
anxious
to
get
their
foot
wet
with
electronics
and
we
sell
a
hundred
of
them
within
a
year
we
get
past
the
gimmick
stage
we
figure
out
how
to
make
electronic
circuit
not
only
multiply
but
divide
a
job
that
be
almost
prohibitively
expensive
to
do
mechanically
at
that
point
electronic
calculator
become
truly
useful
and
our
next
machine
the
ibm
sell
by
the
thousand
although
kirk
and
i
be
never
friend
he
impressed
me
in
the
first
few
month
we
work
together
he
be
not
prepossess
look
he
be
of
average
height
balding
pear
shape
with
rumple
clothing
and
wire
rim
glass
and
he
be
never
without
a
cigarette
but
the
man
be
a
perpetual
motion
machine
in
this
great
seethe
expansion
of
the
company
i
watch
him
organize
and
hire
promote
and
move
army
of
manager
around
he
understood
manufacturing
so
well
that
when
dad
want
to
praise
the
work
of
a
factory
manager
he
d
say
that
be
a
real
kirk
job
kirk
be
also
extremely
popular
with
the
salesman
and
the
customer
he
be
a
talented
piano
player
and
whenever
we
be
in
endicott
people
would
gather
around
him
after
hour
at
the
ibm
country
club
charley
would
sit
sideways
at
the
keyboard
his
cigarette
dangle
from
his
mouth
tap
his
foot
and
banging
out
tune
for
people
to
sing
i
learn
a
lot
from
the
man
for
example
dad
use
to
encourage
people
to
think
of
ibm
as
family
and
to
come
to
him
with
their
problem
but
kirk
warn
me
never
to
get
too
involve
in
factory
worker
life
all
it
take
be
one
story
to
convince
me
he
be
right
he
told
how
when
he
be
in
charge
at
endicott
he
d
gotten
a
letter
from
the
wife
of
an
employee
she
complain
that
her
husband
have
instal
his
mistress
right
in
their
house
kirk
figure
this
wasn
t
right
and
also
not
very
ibmly
so
he
call
the
couple
in
the
husband
say
it
s
really
not
like
my
wife
say
the
woman
be
just
a
friend
and
she
be
in
need
i
don
t
sleep
with
her
the
wife
say
you
certainly
do
at
dinner
you
have
some
kind
of
sleep
pill
you
look
back
and
forth
and
decide
which
one
of
us
you
want
to
spend
the
night
with
and
then
you
put
the
pill
in
the
other
one
s
coffee
that
be
too
much
for
kirk
he
conclude
that
the
less
he
interfere
in
factory
personnel
case
the
well
they
re
a
bottomless
pit
he
told
me
this
be
hardly
the
way
dad
would
have
see
it
but
all
the
same
it
be
marvelous
advice
the
turn
point
in
my
relationship
with
kirk
come
after
we
d
be
work
together
about
four
month
in
may
he
have
an
attack
of
appendicitis
and
miss
six
week
of
work
i
be
still
operating
from
the
corner
of
his
desk
and
by
then
i
d
see
and
heard
enough
to
begin
to
have
a
little
knowledge
of
the
business
while
kirk
be
out
a
great
many
matter
come
to
me
for
decision
partly
because
i
be
his
assistant
and
partly
because
my
name
be
watson
i
think
people
found
it
easy
to
approach
me
than
t
j
who
be
always
unpredictable
they
d
ask
question
i
d
answer
and
i
d
see
result
be
in
that
position
be
fun
it
whet
my
appetite
for
management
i
begin
to
love
the
decision
make
process
the
feel
of
responsibility
and
the
opportunity
to
see
later
whether
a
decision
be
right
or
wrong
it
be
thrill
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
technology
business
as
it
picked
up
speed
in
the
postwar
world
kirk
be
surprised
when
he
come
back
in
june
to
find
that
i
be
right
in
the
thick
of
thing
and
a
lot
of
decision
have
be
make
i
write
them
all
down
for
him
just
as
i
have
for
my
superior
in
the
air
force
in
a
memo
that
be
wait
for
him
when
he
come
in
we
have
do
the
follow
thing
in
your
absence
for
the
follow
reason
dad
who
d
be
travel
much
of
the
time
must
have
be
impressed
because
that
month
he
have
me
elect
vice
president
this
be
no
small
thing
i
be
only
thirty
two
and
ibm
have
only
four
other
vice
president
and
twelve
officer
in
all
dad
s
staff
immediately
put
my
picture
on
banner
for
one
of
ibm
s
frequent
sale
campaign
its
motto
be
let
s
break
all
precedent
for
our
new
vice
president
and
it
embarrass
the
hell
out
of
me
so
when
i
go
on
the
road
to
speak
at
sale
office
i
start
call
it
the
jump
for
junior
campaign
that
make
everybody
laugh
and
take
some
of
the
hot
air
out
of
the
situation
i
think
kirk
and
i
begin
some
serious
reassessment
of
each
other
then
kirk
probably
start
worry
what
be
go
to
happen
to
his
job
at
the
begin
i
don
t
think
he
d
see
me
as
a
contender
after
all
he
knew
my
reputation
from
before
the
war
but
now
he
realize
that
i
could
make
decision
it
couldn
t
have
help
that
in
october
after
the
come
out
and
be
a
success
i
be
elect
to
the
board
of
director
all
this
put
kirk
in
the
toughest
spot
imaginable
he
knew
dad
be
a
hard
drive
character
he
knew
i
be
the
son
and
the
apple
of
dad
s
eye
and
he
knew
that
the
more
he
taught
me
about
the
job
the
less
his
chance
be
of
come
out
on
top
and
yet
he
elect
to
keep
help
me
i
think
he
must
have
figure
the
best
thing
i
can
do
be
to
cooperate
and
hope
that
something
will
happen
maybe
he
ll
fall
on
his
face
or
maybe
if
the
old
man
drop
dead
i
can
get
to
the
top
by
talk
directly
to
the
other
director
he
might
have
be
right
on
that
count
if
dad
have
die
then
the
board
probably
would
have
prefer
to
go
with
kirk
rather
than
take
a
risk
on
me
i
be
still
his
assistant
but
now
i
have
an
office
of
my
own
next
to
his
and
a
secretary
i
start
wonder
how
long
i
might
have
to
work
with
this
man
he
wasn
t
very
polished
and
unlike
my
father
he
have
no
impulse
to
raise
himself
up
culturally
it
be
hard
for
me
to
imagine
him
ever
represent
ibm
to
the
outside
world
which
be
a
big
part
of
dad
s
job
i
d
watch
kirk
give
a
few
speech
around
new
york
at
place
like
the
advertising
club
and
he
be
so
awkward
that
i
felt
embarrass
for
him
and
ibm
the
more
time
we
spent
together
the
more
he
get
on
my
nerve
part
of
my
dislike
of
kirk
stem
from
competitiveness
and
jealousy
of
his
relationship
with
my
father
kirk
be
not
at
all
like
dad
and
i
couldn
t
understand
why
they
be
so
close
but
there
be
more
to
it
than
that
i
didn
t
like
the
side
of
my
father
that
kirk
brought
out
what
bother
me
most
be
the
shuffle
of
men
and
job
there
be
constant
firing
and
transfer
after
the
war
some
of
them
heartrending
i
thought
ibm
be
start
to
seem
pretty
damn
ruthless
in
the
way
it
move
people
around
part
of
this
i
put
down
to
the
difference
between
business
and
the
military
when
i
be
in
the
air
force
you
have
to
get
a
couple
of
poor
efficiency
report
before
they
d
even
transfer
you
i
miss
that
methodical
way
of
reach
judgment
about
people
and
i
question
whether
business
be
really
for
me
but
i
realize
that
if
those
executive
power
be
use
sparingly
and
intelligently
a
business
could
be
the
most
efficient
thing
in
the
world
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
efficient
than
a
government
the
government
have
check
and
balance
but
a
business
be
a
dictatorship
and
that
be
what
make
it
really
move
the
trouble
at
ibm
be
that
the
firing
and
demotion
be
get
out
of
hand
for
many
year
father
s
normal
practice
have
be
to
criticize
someone
he
thought
be
not
pull
his
weight
he
d
say
i
ve
just
go
out
to
kansa
city
and
see
that
man
blair
i
don
t
know
blair
impressed
me
as
be
a
man
who
smoke
a
lot
and
whose
clothing
be
not
really
neat
the
office
didn
t
look
too
good
either
i
m
not
sure
blair
be
a
proper
representative
for
ibm
now
what
he
hop
be
that
if
blair
be
a
good
man
someone
would
leap
to
his
defense
and
say
mr
watson
you
re
wrong
blair
be
one
heck
of
a
guy
and
be
bring
in
a
lot
of
business
blair
might
even
end
up
with
a
raise
as
a
result
that
s
how
it
have
work
before
the
war
but
when
kirk
come
in
so
many
of
the
old
guard
have
resign
or
retire
that
there
be
not
a
great
many
men
around
who
would
stand
up
to
dad
instead
when
he
complain
more
often
than
not
kirk
would
say
since
you
feel
so
strongly
about
blair
i
ll
get
on
the
sleeper
tonight
i
can
be
in
kansa
city
to
handle
blair
tomorrow
morning
and
be
back
here
the
follow
day
handle
meant
fire
and
that
really
shock
me
because
provide
job
security
have
be
a
hallmark
of
dad
s
management
in
the
midst
of
the
grow
tension
between
us
kirk
unintentionally
put
me
through
one
of
the
bad
night
of
my
life
we
be
work
late
and
go
out
for
dinner
and
we
start
talk
about
the
early
day
of
ibm
when
it
be
still
call
ctr
maybe
there
be
some
company
anniversary
come
up
and
we
be
discuss
how
to
celebrate
i
say
something
about
how
charles
flint
have
brought
dad
in
as
president
and
kirk
look
at
me
in
a
funny
way
he
put
his
cigarette
down
and
slowly
say
there
s
something
you
ought
to
know
when
your
father
be
hire
he
be
only
the
general
manager
the
board
wouldn
t
let
him
be
president
what
do
you
mean
when
your
father
be
first
hire
he
be
under
a
criminal
indictment
the
board
knew
he
be
a
good
executive
but
they
didn
t
want
to
risk
have
him
be
president
unless
he
clear
his
name
kirk
must
have
see
from
my
face
that
i
be
shock
he
spent
twenty
minute
explain
this
episode
in
my
father
s
life
that
be
apparently
common
knowledge
but
that
i
d
never
heard
mention
it
have
happen
a
couple
of
year
before
i
be
born
dad
and
all
the
top
management
of
the
national
cash
register
company
include
john
patterson
himself
be
put
on
trial
in
one
of
the
first
great
antitrust
case
the
charge
be
criminal
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
and
maintain
a
monopoly
patterson
have
pioneer
the
use
of
cash
register
and
ncr
still
make
almost
all
the
cash
register
in
america
patterson
thought
the
antitrust
law
of
the
s
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
the
market
be
his
personal
preserve
where
competitor
deserve
to
be
hound
and
destroyed
the
federal
trust
buster
set
out
to
make
an
example
of
the
cash
it
be
a
sensational
case
because
patterson
and
his
men
use
tactic
that
be
ruthless
even
by
turn
of
the
century
standard
dad
s
record
in
the
company
make
him
one
of
the
most
prominent
figure
in
the
case
the
government
claimed
that
in
he
have
pretend
to
quit
his
job
at
the
cash
so
that
he
could
set
up
a
front
operation
secretly
own
by
patterson
that
dealt
in
secondhand
cash
register
the
market
for
use
machine
be
a
particular
sore
spot
with
patterson
he
felt
in
some
sense
that
every
cash
register
ever
built
by
ncr
be
his
and
that
nobody
else
have
a
right
to
sell
ncr
machine
new
or
use
so
he
put
a
million
dollar
at
dad
s
disposal
to
knock
out
secondhand
cash
register
dealer
nationwide
dad
would
go
into
a
city
open
his
own
secondhand
store
put
pressure
on
the
other
dealer
by
bidding
up
price
for
use
machine
and
finally
buy
the
competitor
out
for
this
kirk
told
me
dad
have
be
convict
and
sentence
to
a
year
in
prison
patterson
and
the
others
be
convict
as
well
but
the
case
be
appeal
and
no
one
ever
serve
time
after
a
few
month
the
conviction
get
thrown
out
on
a
technicality
and
patterson
and
the
others
settle
by
signing
a
consent
decree
to
clean
up
their
business
practice
dad
who
insist
all
along
that
he
be
innocent
refuse
to
sign
but
by
that
time
he
have
left
the
cash
for
other
reason
and
the
government
never
sought
a
second
trial
this
be
an
extremely
bitter
story
to
hear
from
charley
kirk
i
go
straight
home
after
the
meal
and
that
night
i
couldn
t
sleep
in
all
the
time
i
d
know
my
father
he
have
live
and
do
business
in
a
manner
beyond
reproach
could
he
have
knowingly
broken
the
law
i
imagine
him
as
a
callow
young
man
still
less
than
thirty
year
old
with
humble
root
and
great
ambition
and
ten
year
experience
in
lowly
job
vary
from
clerk
in
a
grocery
store
to
sell
sew
machine
i
thought
about
how
loyal
he
be
to
patterson
and
here
be
patterson
say
i
trust
you
with
a
million
dollar
go
do
this
thing
we
re
in
the
right
those
machine
be
ours
and
they
shouldn
t
be
dealt
in
by
these
secondhand
guy
at
that
point
in
his
life
dad
do
not
understand
the
illegality
he
be
get
into
the
antitrust
law
be
still
quite
new
and
he
hadn
t
gotten
much
past
the
eighth
grade
but
he
certainly
must
have
see
the
subterfuge
at
least
i
now
knew
why
my
father
have
what
i
d
always
consider
the
most
irrational
hatred
of
the
department
of
justice
i
didn
t
blame
kirk
for
tell
me
the
bad
news
he
be
do
me
a
favor
and
it
be
far
well
to
hear
it
from
someone
who
admire
and
sympathize
with
dad
but
i
be
gain
on
kirk
in
business
skill
and
that
cause
our
relationship
to
go
downhill
rapidly
the
more
kirk
worried
about
his
job
the
more
of
a
yes
man
he
become
to
dad
the
minute
my
father
question
a
man
s
performance
kirk
would
pull
the
trigger
on
the
guy
it
happen
late
in
with
a
district
manager
name
harry
eilers
he
be
a
very
accomplish
and
popular
man
and
he
ran
the
midwestern
sale
district
from
minneapolis
one
day
dad
ask
kirk
whether
it
might
not
make
more
sense
to
locate
district
headquarters
in
chicago
kirk
immediately
order
eilers
to
move
and
when
he
say
that
he
couldn
t
without
probe
far
kirk
demote
him
to
run
a
sale
office
and
name
a
new
district
manager
in
chicago
that
burn
me
up
because
i
knew
eilers
be
good
later
it
come
out
that
illness
and
family
circumstance
have
kept
him
from
accept
the
transfer
but
kirk
wouldn
t
budge
and
dad
back
him
so
eilers
be
out
in
april
of
i
finally
decide
that
i
couldn
t
tolerate
work
with
kirk
anymore
i
go
into
dad
s
office
and
told
him
i
be
quit
i
say
look
dad
kirk
be
here
i
can
get
along
with
all
the
other
people
you
ve
hire
but
not
kirk
he
s
not
my
kind
of
guy
he
s
too
rough
and
he
s
only
nine
year
old
than
i
if
i
stay
i
m
go
to
have
to
work
for
him
for
twenty
two
year
before
he
s
old
enough
to
retire
then
i
ll
run
the
business
for
eight
year
and
it
ll
be
time
for
me
to
retire
too
i
can
t
look
forward
to
that
i
be
quite
serious
even
though
i
hadn
t
the
slightest
idea
what
i
d
do
next
dad
begin
to
argue
with
me
and
i
end
up
storm
out
i
call
olive
and
ask
if
she
d
drive
into
the
city
it
be
probably
six
o
clock
by
the
time
she
met
me
at
the
waldorf
we
have
dinner
and
then
go
upstairs
to
the
roof
and
drank
champagne
and
dance
i
told
her
what
i
d
do
and
she
say
i
m
sure
you
re
go
to
feel
sorry
later
finally
around
eleven
o
clock
we
get
in
our
car
and
drove
home
dad
really
knew
how
to
put
on
a
show
when
he
need
to
we
get
out
to
greenwich
around
midnight
as
i
drove
up
to
our
house
i
saw
dad
s
car
and
chauffeur
park
there
and
i
say
to
olive
oh
my
god
when
we
walk
in
mother
and
father
be
both
in
the
library
the
light
be
turn
down
very
low
and
my
poor
mother
be
sit
way
over
in
a
corner
exhaust
because
it
be
so
late
dad
be
sit
hunch
in
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
look
about
as
frail
and
old
as
he
knew
how
he
probably
have
dim
those
light
intentionally
to
create
that
effect
i
walk
in
and
be
ready
to
walk
out
again
but
he
held
out
his
hand
and
say
tom
you
just
can
t
do
this
to
me
you
can
t
quit
he
didn
t
quite
come
out
and
say
please
don
t
destroy
my
lifelong
ambition
but
there
be
no
doubt
that
s
what
he
meant
i
say
dad
look
you
re
a
man
of
the
world
you
can
see
that
even
if
you
take
out
all
the
personality
and
just
call
us
mr
smith
and
mr
jones
the
fact
remains
that
i
m
thirty
four
and
i
ve
get
to
work
until
i
m
fifty
six
before
i
get
a
chance
at
command
i
can
see
your
point
of
view
i
can
see
your
point
of
view
he
say
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
take
mr
kirk
to
europe
introduce
him
to
the
manager
over
there
and
i
ll
think
of
something
there
be
a
meeting
of
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
schedule
in
montreux
switzerland
in
june
the
organization
have
revive
after
the
war
though
it
wasn
t
as
influential
as
before
kirk
and
i
be
both
schedule
to
go
as
u
s
delegate
and
i
make
plan
to
show
charley
around
europe
afterward
and
introduce
him
to
the
manager
of
various
country
many
of
whom
i
d
know
since
childhood
i
didn
t
know
what
would
happen
after
that
i
doubt
dad
do
either
at
that
point
he
sent
us
to
europe
because
he
be
play
for
time
the
thing
keep
me
calm
be
that
i
knew
i
be
either
go
to
get
the
problem
fix
or
leave
i
d
cross
the
bridge
of
try
to
wait
it
out
subconsciously
i
suppose
i
thought
my
old
man
would
handle
kirk
so
in
may
of
kirk
and
i
set
sail
for
europe
with
our
wife
the
international
chamber
meeting
be
a
bore
afterward
we
hooked
up
with
valentim
boucas
whom
dad
have
picked
to
escort
us
around
europe
boucas
be
ibm
s
representative

one
of
the

and
genial

i
ever
knew
he
go
all
the
way
back
to
my
childhood

he
have
the
kind
of
vivid
personality
that
could
project
happiness
to
everybody
in
a
room
he
be
a
bit
of
an
operator
which
dad
never
want
to
admit
he
let
boucas
have
the
ibm
brazil
concession
for
almost
no
money
and
boucas

enormously
wealthy
as
a
result
boucas
figure
i
be
go
to
become
head

well
and

translate
then
they
call
on
boucas
who
knew
how
to
speak
english

night
because

knew
kirk
couldn
t
understand

my
attention
when
i
heard

and
a
half
an
hour
over
a
half
hour
there
and
an
hour
back
then
we
re
back
where
we
start
no
no
because
while
you
re
do
that
the
car
could
have
be
go
two
and
a
half
hour
in
this
other
direction
so
two
and
a
half
and
two
and
a
half
be
five
i
knew
there
be
a
fallacy
in
what
he
be
say
but
i
be
too
damn
mad
to
think
what
it
be
and
he
hung
right
in
there
insist
he
be
right
the
vehemence
of
that
silly
argument
be
hard
to
describe
but
i
m
glad
it
stop
when
it
do
olive
pull
at
my
coat
and
i
be
able
to
shut
up
and
get
in
our
car
we
finally
reach
lyon
that
even
late
that
night
i
be
awaken
by
heavy
knock
on
our
hotel
room
door
it
be
our
secretary
come
quickly
mr
watson
he
say
mr
kirk
be
very
sick
i
put
on
a
robe
and
follow
him
kirk
have
have
a
massive
coronary
when
i
get
to
his
room
he
be
unconscious
and
within
an
hour
he
be
dead
the
kirk
be
catholic
and
mr
kirk
say
she
want
to
go
to
mass
so
as
day
broke
we
go
to
the
lyon
cathedral
since
there
have
to
be
an
autopsy
boucas
and
i
stayed
behind
while
olive
take
mr
kirk
on
to
paris
where
she
could
get
her
into
a
more
comfortable
hotel
then
we
all
brought
the
coffin
home
with
us
to
new
york
dad
felt
kirk
s
death
as
a
personal
loss
kirk
be
his
number
two
man
and
one
of
ibm
s
own
probably
he
also
felt
relief
that
a
huge
problem
have
be
solve
and
i
m
sure
he
felt
guilt
at
that
relief
i
could
see
those
emotion
in
the
funeral
he
give
kirk
in
endicott
it
be
really
something
dad
trot
out
college
president
there
be
a
number
of
eulogy
and
the
service
take
over
two
and
a
half
hour
for
the
first
and
last
time
at
a
great
occasion
dad
didn
t
give
a
speech
i
later
heard
that
during
the
procession
out
of
the
church
dad
be
so
emotional
that
he
force
his
way
between
two
pallbearer
and
grabbed
an
edge
of
the
coffin
himself
i
d
always
look
at
charley
kirk
as
a
barrier
between
my
father
and
me
it
wasn
t
until
after
kirk
s
death
that
i
realize
he
have
also
be
a
buffer
undiluted
t
j
watson
could
be
pretty
hard
to
take
he
now
have
the
big
and
most
successful
one
man
show
in
american
business
with
something
like
twenty
two
thousand
people
work
as
if
they
be
an
extension
of
his
personality
to
dad
it
seem
perfectly
natural
that
his
photograph
should
hang
in
everybody
s
office
it
didn
t
embarrass
him
in
the
slightest
when
his
men
organize
a
worldwide
ibm
celebration
on
the
thirty
third
anniversary
of
his
employment
the
company
newspaper
described
this
as
a
spontaneous
tribute
even
though
everybody
knew
it
take
month
to
prepare
dad
be
now
in
his
seventy
and
as
he
age
the
song
tribute
picture
and
adulation
have
gradually
gotten
out
of
hand
until
well
into
the
s
dad
be
much
more
famous
than
the
company
ibm
dealt
with
other
business
not
consumer
so
it
be
far
from
a
household
name
like
ford
or
metropolitan
life
whenever
we
be
write
up
in
the
saturday
even
post
or
some
other
popular
magazine
the
spotlight
be
always
on
dad
and
his
ability
to
make
ten
of
thousand
of
people
march
to
slogan
like
a
salesman
be
a
man
who
sell
and
there
be
no
such
thing
as
stand
still
we
be
know
as
a
personality
cult
i
thought
this
image
be
bad
for
dad
and
bad
for
the
company
but
i
couldn
t
say
point
blank
honest
to
pete
this
be
ridiculous
it
would
have
cause
an
ungodly
explosion
for
anyone
who
question
his
way
of
operating
dad
have
an
impregnable
defense
look
at
the
record
you
could
argue
it
wasn
t
slogan
that
be
make
the
record
but
he
d
say
how
do
you
know
so
it
wasn
t
an
easy
thing
to
be
at
dad
s
side
during
the
hundred
percent
club
convention
in
endicott
the
summer
of
kirk
s
death
the
annual
hundred
percent
club
meeting
have
long
since
outgrown
the
waldorf
where
it
be
held
in
the
late
s
by
now
we
have
well
over
a
thousand
men
in
the
sale
force
worldwide
over
eight
hundred
and
fifty

be
suppose
to
be

as

dad
go
all

for
their
three

stay
he
have

percenters
comfortable
all
the
sleep
tent
have
wood
floor
and

foot
muddy
if
it
rain
once
the
convention
be

each

and
find

which
they
could
hear
each

the

the
hundred
percent

year
and
the
more
drama
he
could
wring
out
of
it
the
more
he
like
it
he
arrive
in
endicott
on
opening
morning
i
met
him
at
the
train
and
we
walk
into
the
back
of
the
big
tent
exactly
twenty
minute
before
the
band
be
suppose
to
start
play
ever
onward
the
ibm
anthem
a
little
group
of
convention
planner
greet
us
look
both
proud
and
nervous
dad
say
now
what
do
you
fellow

in
mind
this
morning
i
d
like

go
to
open
of
course
t
j
watson
be
go
to
open
we
allow
you
twenty
minute
they
told
him
that

nice
that
s
all
i

you

a
presentation
by
mr
thomas
d
arcy
brophy
the
head
of
the
american
heritage
foundation
now
wait
a
minute
the
most
important
person
be
the
salesman
i
want
to
hear
from
all
the
hundred
percenters
i
knew
he
be
think
of
the
s
when
each
salesman
would
get
up
and
speak
for
three
minute
those
banquet
have
be
endlessly
boring
the
salesman
be
great
fellow
but
they
weren
t
philosophical
enough
to
write
decent
speech
so
i
say
dad
this
be
not
like
the
s
we
only
have
a
hundred
men
back
then
and
it
s
almost
nine
hundred
this
year
well
they
could
each
say
just
a
line
or
two
somehow
he
get
past
that
issue
but
then
he
found
something
else
to
pick
at
he
say
let
me
see
the
product
do
you
have
product
here
by
now
it
be
about
eleven
minute
until
the
band
would
strike
up
he
go
into
the
display
tent
and
point
to
the
machine
near
the
door
that
s
a
tabulate
machine
there
we
ought
to
have
a
keypunch
the
first
step
in
any
installation
be
the
keypunch
then
the
card
get
sort
and
then
they
come
to
the
tabulate
machine
but
you
fellow
have
the
tabulate
machine
in
front
but
mr
watson
we
can
t
move
it
now
well
let
s
go
into
that
for
a
moment
then
they
have
to
haggle
with
him
about
that
mr
watson
this
be
all
plan
by
the
product
display
department
this
tabulate
machine
be
our
best
new
product
i
don
t
care
about
that
i
want
to
have
it
right
he
be
have
a
terrific
time
but
it
be
terrible
for
everyone
else
the
real
danger
be
that
he
would
say
gentleman
i
don
t
care
if
nine
hundred
men
be
come
into
this
tent
in
three
minute
let
them
wait
i
want
you
all
to
come
to
my
room
we
re
go
to
talk
this
out
fortunately
it
never
come
to
that
partly
because
i
intervene
and
make
an
appeal
to
his
heart
and
his
common
sense
dad
some
of
these
men
have
be
up
for
two
night
work
to
get
these
machine
position
and
run
where
they
be
we
can
t
tear
it
all
up
now
well
he
say
i
guess
not
a
couple
of
minute
later
the
band
begin
to
play
the
men
file
in
and
the
hundred
percent
club
come
off
gloriously
as
plan
people
expect
this
kind
of
cantankerousness
from
dad
but
i
don
t
think
any
employer
get
away
with
be
truly
arbitrary
for
long
before
his
best
executive
quit
and
his
worker
join
union
that
didn
t
happen
to
dad
because
he
be
extremely
sensitive
to
the
need
of
the
people
he
hire
from
the
minute
ibm
start
make
large
profit
in
the
s
he
kept
the
company
in
the
vanguard
of
humane
employer
ibm
offer
the
best
benefit
money
could
buy
which
in
the
early
day
meant
good
pay
steady
employment
a
chance
to
get
promote
educational
opportunity
clean
shop
and
country
club
the
new
deal
and
the
rise
of
labor
union
change
the
public
s
idea
of
what
big
institution
ought
to
provide
and
dad
respond
with
a
broad
new
plan
as
soon
as
the
war
end
he
unveiled
it
step
by
step
in
a
series
of
address
that
be
make
in
the
most
dramatic
possible
way
they
be
model
after
roosevelt
s
fireside
chat
because
ibm
be
so
big
that
it
be
impractical
to
gather
everybody
together
in
a
single
place
dad
arrange
for
the
telephone
company
to
put
a
microphone
on
his
desk
and
hook
it
up
so
that
he
could
be
heard
simultaneously
over
the
public
address
system
of
the
factory
in
poughkeepsie
and
endicott
and
in
several
large
office
he
be
very
good
at
these
speech
he
d
start
by
say
the
war
be
over
and
you
ve
support
the
company
very
loyally
during
the
war
then
he
d
review
the
success
of
the
business
thank
the
employee
for
their
effort
and
remind
them
of
the
benefit
ibm
already
offer
he
d
talk
about
intangible
thing
that
make
ibm
a
good
place
to
work
like
the
right
of
any
man
to
appeal
to
dad
personally
if
he
thought
he
be
be
unfairly
treat
finally
he
d
announce
a
new
plan
to
cover
sickness
and
accident
hospitalization
disability
or
whatever
when
he
announce
the
new
ibm
pension
plan
dad
wrap
up
his
speech
by
say
that
ibm
s
constant
purpose
be
to
relieve
its
people
of
fear
for
the
care
of
themselves
and
their
family
roosevelt
himself
couldn
t
have
say
it
well
underneath
all
the
old
fashion
folderol
the
ibm
of
be
amazingly
up
to
date
i
discover
that
dad
have
his
finger
in
everything
at
ibm
a
phenomenal
number
of
executive
at
one
point
i
count
thirty
eight
or
forty
report
to
my
father
directly
all
these
individual
have
title
some
high
and
some
low
but
such
distinction
didn
t
matter
because
they
all
report
to
him
people
be
constantly
wait
outside
his
door
sometimes
for
as
long
as
a
week
or
two
before
they
could
see
him
he
saw
the
important
one
of
course
but
when
i
complain
about
people
waste
time
in
his
anteroom
he
say
oh
tom
let
them
wait
they
re
well
paid
we
have
no
organization
chart
because
dad
didn
t
want
people
to
be
so
focus
on
specific
job
that
they
concentrate
only
on
those
job
he
love
to
tell
the
story
of
visit
a
friend
from
the
cash
who
have
go
to
work
at
an
automobile
company
at
the
man
s
office
there
be
organization
chart
everywhere
each
employee
have
one
over
his
desk
along
with
a
small
frame
job
description
spell
out
what
that
individual
be
specifically
responsible
for
it
be
the
bad
thing
i
ever
saw
dad
would
say
it
be
so
restrict
he
want
everybody
to
be
interested
in
everything
it
wasn
t
unusual
for
dad
to
call
a
sale
manager
to
do
a
factory
job
or
a
factory
manager
to
do
a
sale
job
and
he
would
demand
answer
and
opinion
and
judgment
on
any
segment
of
the
business
obviously
ibm
be
become
too
big
for
that
to
be
entirely
practical
but
it
be
his
way
of
stretch
each
man
and
make
him
think
about
the
business
as
a
whole
i
be
fascinate
by
the
routine
he
follow
on
ordinary
business
day
he
never
come
to
the
office
without
have
in
mind
four
or
five
thing
he
want
to
get
do
he
might
have
thought
these
thing
up
the
night
before
or
while
he
be
shave
in
the
morning
or
maybe
he
d
talk
with
somebody
at
dinner
and
a
casual
remark
have
remind
him
of
something
but
when
he
hit
the
office
he
knew
what
he
want
to
accomplish
he
d
sit
down
at
his
desk
and
then
for
item
a
on
his
list
he
would
pick
an
executive
it
wasn
t
necessarily
the
guy
you
d
think
would
get
the
job
but
the
one
he
felt
be
the
right
man
to
do
it
that
day
dad
would
buzz
and
the
man
would
come
in
and
dad
would
give
him
the
word
for
some
thing
he
might
call
several
men
and
then
there
would
be
a
meeting
but
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
d
clear
those
four
or
five
item
out
of
his
mind
if
he
get
everything
launch
before
lunchtime
after
lunch
he
d
sit
in
his
office
and
call
in
a
few
more
men
at
random
he
d
think
well
i
haven
t
shaken
up
so
and
so
for
a
while
so
i
ll
get
him
in
and
ask
some
question
about
his
department
and
in
the
process
part
his
hair
a
little
he
ll
get
a
pat
on
the
back
if
i
find
something
good
or
a
kick
in
the
tail
if
i
find
something
bad
in
the
course
of
a
month
he
d
have
see
nearly
every
one
of
the
thirty
eight
people
reporting
to
him
he
dealt
out
kick
in
the
pant
and
pat
on
the
back
in
about
equal
proportion
dad
use
to
badger
the
financial
men
mercilessly
even
though
our
business
be
to
sell
accounting
equipment
dad
didn
t
particularly
trust
number
he
thought
they
could
distract
a
businessman
from
the
real
issue
at
hand
our
controller
in
those
day
be
a
contemporary
of
mine
name
al
williams
who
soon
become
my
best
friend
and
eventually
rise
to
be
president
of
ibm
he
be
extremely
talented
but
that
never
stop
dad
from
give
him
hell
al
have
a
little
loose
leaf
book
where
he
d
write
in
very
fine
print
the
basic
figure
of
the
business
father
would
look
at
that
book
and
say
only
half
jokingly
this
fellow
williams
can
t
keep
anything
in
his
head
he
have
to
go
to
that
little
book
of
course
the
kind
of
question
dad
ask
be
so
arbitrary
that
you
d
need
twenty
book
to
answer
them
he
d
say
now
williams
how
do
we
do
last
year
in
peru
williams
would
say
i
ll
have
to
find
that
out
our
subsidiary
in
peru
be
very
small
i
just
don
t
know
how
we
do
never
mind
let
s
take
a
big
company
let
s
take
brazil
we
do
a
nice
business
in
brazil
don
t
we
williams
would
go
back
to
his
office
and
call
together
his
assistant
these
be
old
professional
who
really
knew
the
business
he
d
say
let
s
add
a
section
to
my
book
here
that
will
give
the
status
of
each
of
our
foreign
subsidiary
we
be
operating
in
almost
eighty
country
so
that
would
mean
several
new
page
all
write
very
small
but
the
next
time
al
and
dad
met
dad
would
be
on
a
different
track
mr
williams
how
about
platinum
do
we
use
any
platinum
i
notice
it
be
go
up
quite
a
little
you
ought
to
have
those
figure
that
little
notebook
eventually
grow
to
four
hundred
page
it
be
so
fat
al
couldn
t
get
it
into
his
pocket
he
always
perspire
easily
but
in
my
father
s
office
al
s
palm
would
get
so
wet
that
he
need
a
handkerchief
to
turn
the
doorknob
when
it
be
time
to
leave
like
williams
some
of
the
men
on
the
receive
end
of
dad
s
kick
and
pat
be
very
able
executive
dad
would
often
be
on
the
road
or
be
busy
with
outside
commitment
so
that
for
week
at
a
stretch
ibm
would
run
itself
which
be
to
say
that
the
vice
president
and
department
head
would
make
the
necessary
decision
and
do
the
work
yet
with
the
exception
of
al
and
one
or
two
others
it
be
rare
for
these
men
to
speak
their
mind
when
dad
be
around
the
longer
i
work
at
ibm
the
more
i
become
convince
that
my
father
s
style
silence
too
many
people
dad
never
formally
try
to
teach
me
about
business
when
i
spent
time
with
him
i
almost
always
picked
up
something
but
it
would
never
have
work
for
me
to
pull
up
my
chair
alongside
his
desk
as
i
have
with
kirk
because
it
didn
t
take
much
to
get
us
into
a
tangle
generally
i
stayed
in
my
own
office
on
the
sixteenth
floor
of
our
madison
avenue
headquarters
and
if
he
want
me
he
d
call
his
office
be
one
floor
up
on
the
seventeenth
floor
there
be
a
buzzer
near
my
desk
and
a
stairway
outside
my
door
dad
be
totally
unpredictable
when
that
buzzer
sound
i
never
knew
whether
he
be
go
to
bring
me
up
there
and
say
son
i
want
you
to
meet
mr
alfred
p
sloan
or
tom
i
m
really
dissatisfied
with
the
way
thing
be
go
west
of
the
mississippi
his
method
be
to
give
me
more
and
more
latitude
in
make
my
own
decision
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
me
fight
on
anything
that
require
his
approval
i
d
have
to
go
up
to
his
office
and
do
a
sale
pitch
and
more
often
than
not
we
d
end
up
in
an
argument
i
knew
that
he
be
try
to
test
me
temper
me
and
expose
me
to
the
think
process
that
have
make
him
so
successful
that
didn
t
make
his
method
any
easy
to
take
he
would
second
guess
virtually
anything
i
do
sometimes
i
d
get
the
feel
that
no
detail
of
my
work
be
too
tiny
to
escape
his
notice
for
example
when
i
d
first
move
out
of
kirk
s
office
a
pretty
secretary
name
claudia
pequin
be
assign
to
me
one
even
when
we
be
work
late
father
come
to
the
door
of
my
office
and
knock
the
room
be
overheat
and
we
d
be
in
there
a
while
so
he
must
have
gotten
hit
with
a
blast
of
perfume
when
i
open
the
door
he
let
several
day
go
by
he
would
often
let
time
pas
for
the
sake
of
drama
and
then
one
day
he
say
you
know
tom
there
be
an
unusual
relationship
between
a
man
and
his
secretary
i
ve
always
have
male
secretary
now
i
don
t
mean
to
suggest
that
you
be
do
anything
wrong
but
in
the
course
of
business
you
end
up
have
to
travel
with
your
secretary
for
example
and
the
look
of
it
might
be
misinterpret
by
coincidence
miss
pequin
left
ibm
to
go
to
mcgill
university
not
long
afterward
i
saw
to
it
that
the
next
secretary
assign
to
me
be
male
dad
be
teach
me
but
he
wasn
t
ready
to
promote
me
yet
he
take
kirk
s
job
and
give
it
to
george
phillips
old
george
phillips
who
have
be
my
babysitter
and
taught
me
to
shoot
at
first
i
didn
t
mind
because
phillips
though
thoroughly
devote
to
dad
be
no
operating
man
and
with
him
in
the
job
the
organization
get
use
to
the
fact
that
i
be
probably
go
to
move
up
but
i
d
have
phillips
all
line
up
in
total
agreement
with
something
i
want
to
do
and
then
we
d
go
into
dad
s
office
if
dad
didn
t
agree
he
d
treat
phillips
just
the
way
he
use
to
when
phillips
be
only
his
secretary
phillips
how
could
you
possibly
say
yes
to
that
you
know
that
isn
t
right
phillips
would
instantly
reverse
himself
at
such
moment
there
be
no
way
to
persuade
him
that
dad
wasn
t
infallible
and
i
d
be
back
where
i
start
i
be
in
a
pell
mell
rush
to
make
a
success
of
myself
and
pretty
quickly
i
take
over
the
role
of
vice
president
of
sale
even
though
someone
else
normally
perform
that
function
it
didn
t
surprise
anybody
who
knew
the
other
fellow
that
i
could
do
this
he
be
a
nice
man
but
shy
and
weak
and
he
try
to
conceal
it
by
buttering
up
my
father
and
be
pompous
he
be
the
first
harvard
graduate
ibm
ever
have
dad
have
hire
him
because
he
be
the
son
of
one
of
dad
s
friend
in
short
hill
and
he
thought
the
man
raise
ibm
s
image
so
much
that
he
eventually
put
him
on
the
board
but
all
the
other
executive
knew
that
the
fellow
never
really
pitch
in
it
seem
perfectly
natural
for
me
to
get
involve
in
the
sale
force
because
that
be
the
area
that
meant
most
to
dad
i
go
on
the
road
as
dad
have
always
go
on
the
road
spending
long
week
inspect
office
call
on
customer
and
praise
and
encourage
the
men
our
great
expansion
meant
that
there
be
hundred
of
mundane
problem
to
solve
i
remember
take
a
trip
with
phillips
in
the
midwest
and
go
to
inspect
the
struggle
little
office
we
have
in
pierre
south
dakota
this
be
one
of
the
office
we
d
open
after
dad
decide
we
should
be
represent
in
every
state
capital
pierre
itself
be
a
tiny
place
we
spent
a
morning
shoot
ring
necked
pheasant
in
a
field
no
more
than
three
mile
from
the
center
of
town
dad
s
idea
for
make
small
office
like
this
succeed
be
to
install
three
way
men
who
sell
product
from
all
three
of
our
division
time
clock
tabulate
machine
and
typewriter
but
the
office
be
lose
money
and
i
saw
that
three
way
men
would
never
work
the
product
be
too
diverse
for
most
salesman
to
span
i
complain
about
this
to
phillips
but
then
decide
not
to
make
any
far
fuss
it
be
well
for
dad
to
open
a
few
office
he
might
later
have
to
close
than
never
to
open
any
new
one
at
all
one
change
i
do
push
through
be
designate
liaison
men
to
serve
as
mr
ibm
in
city
where
we
have
multiple
operation
in
place
like
chicago
we
d
have
one
office
sell
to
bank
one
to
government
agency
one
to
small
business
and
so
on
that
help
hone
our
sale
pitch
but
it
make
for
labor
problem
because
there
be
no
coordination
on
thing
as
basic
as
salary
there
would
be
two
or
three
ibm
office
in
a
building
and
when
typist
met
each
other
on
the
elevator
they
d
talk
and
find
out
they
be
make
different
wage
in
the
different
office
the
liaison
men
usually
old
manager
who
want
to
slow
down
a
bit
help
iron
out
these
discrepancy
the
part
of
my
work
that
i
love
best
be
pick
and
choose
men
in
the
maelstrom
of
postwar
activity
promotion
come
very
rapidly
we
be
constantly
name
new
branch
and
district
manager
assistant
manager
and
so
forth
many
of
these
job
go
to
young
men
just
back
from
the
war
and
the
average
age
of
ibm
official
quickly
drop
below
forty
i
be
very
outspoken
about
who
should
get
promote
and
i
never
doubt
my
ability
to
make
personnel
decision
fast
and
make
most
of
them
right
i
never
felt
too
sure
of
my
intellectual
depth
but
i
knew
i
have
a
lot
of
common
sense
when
i
found
people
who
i
thought
could
contribute
a
lot
to
the
business
i
would
prod
them
along
i
do
this
with
a
self
confidence
that
surprised
people
who
knew
what
i
d
be
like
before
i
come
under
general
bradley
s
influence
i
m
sure
one
of
those
take
aback
be
vin
learson
who
eventually
succeed
me
as
ibm
s
chairman
vin
be
still
just
a
branch
manager
in
in
charge
of
our
philadelphia
office
but
he
be
a
man
of
great
force
with
a
superior
record
and
i
be
planning
to
promote
him
then
i
get
a
letter
from
a
man
complain
that
he
have
rent
a
house
from
learson
and
now
learson
be
sue
him
they
be
fight
over
the
cost
of
repair
damage
from
a
broken
water
pipe
or
some
such
problem
so
i
call
learson
in
i
hand
him
the
letter
and
say
get
your
sight
up
you
be
tremendously
able
and
you
be
go
to
the
top
of
this
business
don
t
mess
around
with
petty
little
thing
where
everybody
be
go
to
know
you
re
in
a
lawsuit
for
two
thousand
buck
learson
just
nod
the
lawsuit
never
come
up
again
and
he
be
put
in
charge
of
a
sale
district
the
follow
year
i
remember
the
first
time
i
ever
fought
to
keep
a
man
from
quit
it
be
kirk
s
pal
birkenstock
the
one
dad
have
promote
over
so
many
other
men
he
come
to
see
me
soon
after
kirk
s
death
and
thing
weren
t
go
well
for
him
at
all
he
hadn
t
be
able
to
handle
the
job
of
general
sale
manager
and
even
before
kirk
die
he
have
be
demote
to
run
a
market
research
department
call
future
demand
he
knew
kirk
and
i
have
be
rival
and
i
m
sure
he
expect
me
to
do
him
in
but
i
actually
thought
he
have
a
lot
go
for
him
he
be
even
smarter
than
kirk
more
attune
to
the
outside
world
and
could
think
down
into
the
depth
of
thing
i
would
have
told
him
so
if
he
d
let
me
but
the
minute
he
get
into
my
office
he
make
noise
like
there
s
nothing
much
left
for
me
i
ve
lose
my
job
as
general
sale
manager
all
i
m
do
now
be
make
work
i
didn
t
like
his
tone
so
i
forgot
about
give
compliment
i
say
you
must
not
have
much
confidence
in
yourself
so
you
have
a
big
mentor
and
if
he
have
live
you
d
have
have
an
easy
time
but
all
of
a
sudden
he
s
not
there
do
you
want
people
to
think
you
ve
lose
your
nerve
if
you
re
any
good
you
can
make
it
with
me
with
t
j
with
anybody
not
just
kirk
now
if
you
think
i
m
not
fair
mind
you
ought
to
quit
but
otherwise
you
ought
to
stay
because
this
be
where
the
opportunity
be
he
say
do
you
mean
i
can
stay
and
not
be
under
a
cloud
if
a
man
wasn
t
willing
to
stand
up
for
himself
i
didn
t
want
to
work
with
him
and
i
didn
t
think
he
should
be
in
the
company
i
hat
the
atmosphere
of
adulation
dad
have
surround
himself
with
he
have
people
hang
on
his
every
word
as
if
he
be
the
messiah
i
thought
the
executive
at
ibm
be
stunt
because
of
it
the
high
a
man
rise
the
less
opportunity
he
have
to
use
his
common
sense
from
my
day
as
a
salesman
i
have
a
pretty
good
idea
who
dad
s
yes
men
be
and
i
d
pick
on
these
guy
at
the
slightest
provocation
i
be
right
most
of
the
time
but
occasionally
i
be
wrong
as
hell
i
make
a
terrible
mistake
early
in
for
example
dad
be
after
me
because
he
thought
ibm
repairman
be
spending
too
much
time
on
what
we
call
inspection
this
meant
check
machine
in
the
field
even
if
they
be
run
just
fine
today
it
would
be
know
as
preventive
maintenance
and
i
be
for
it
but
dad
thought
of
it
as
fix
thing
that
weren
t
broken
and
we
have
some
pretty
hot
word
on
the
subject
dad
then
decide
to
seek
the
opinion
of
j
j
kenney
who
be
in
charge
of
sale
promotion
poor
jack
kenney
didn
t
know
the
first
thing
about
repairman
and
he
be
the
type
of
guy
who
be
so
awkward
with
tool
that
he
probably
would
have
have
trouble
put
in
a
screw
straight
but
he
d
work
around
dad
a
long
time
and
i
figure
kenney
would
automatically
agree
that
inspection
should
be
cut
i
be
wait
for
him
near
his
office
as
soon
as
he
come
back
from
talk
to
dad
tell
me
i
say
do
the
subject
of
inspection
come
up
when
he
say
it
have
i
blew
up
i
accuse
him
of
yessing
the
old
man
i
be
in
such
a
state
that
i
almost
call
him
a
coward
except
that
he
quit
first
and
walk
out
i
knew
i
d
go
too
far
kenney
be
a
superior
man
who
have
start
as
an
office
boy
and
work
his
way
up
and
father
would
be
furious
if
we
lose
him
to
make
matter
bad
i
found
out
later
that
day
that
kenney
hadn
t
yessed
dad
at
all
on
the
contrary
he
d
go
into
dad
s
office
carry
an
automobile
owner
s
manual
and
use
it
to
point
out
that
car
need
periodic
maintenance
even
though
they
be
much
less
complicate
than
ibm
machine
so
presumably
ibm
machine
need
it
too
i
really
panicked
the
next
morning
i
have
a
man
wait
for
kenney
on
the
train
platform
to
ask
him
to
reconsider
and
when
he
come
into
the
office
i
go
straight
to
him
he
listen
to
me
apologize
and
beg
for
two
hour
until
finally
he
be
pretty
sure
he
d
taught
me
a
lesson
then
he
agree
to
stay
i
d
have
make
more
mistake
like
this
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
the
good
advice
of
an
executive
name
red
lamotte
whom
i
d
know
from
boyhood
there
weren
t
many
old
timer
left
who
be
bold
enough
to
speak
their
mind
but
lamotte
be
fearless
he
be
best
know
within
ibm
for
have
land
the
massive
social
security
contract
in
the
thirty
but
i
thought
of
him
as
the
only
man
who
have
ever
do
to
my
father
what
j
j
kenney
have
just
do
to
me
it
happen
back
in
the
s
dad
have
be
let
lamotte
have
it
for
not
make
a
sale
finally
red
say
in
a
rather
dignify
way
mr
watson
i
don
t
really
think
we
can
continue
to
do
business
together
thanks
a
lot
and
he
go
home
to
gramercy
park
where
he
and
his
wife
have
a
lovely
apartment
within
a
few
hour
dad
be
there
rap
at
the
door
red
and
his
wife
politely
take
dad
s
coat
and
his
derby
and
sat
him
down
act
as
though
they
have
no
idea
why
he
d
come
with
lamotte
sit
right
in
the
room
dad
turn
to
his
wife
and
say
lois
i
ve
make
a
great
mistake
and
i
need
your
help
red
be
one
of
the
people
i
count
on
to
move
ibm
ahead
he
have
resign
and
i
m
here
to
apologize
and
make
sure
i
ll
have
him
back
with
me
dad
be
too
proud
to
say
i
m
sorry
directly
but
red
gracefully
accepted
the
apology
anyway
lamotte
be
an
able
guy
in
his
own
right
but
it
didn
t
hurt
that
his
wife
be
the
daughter
of
one
of
ibm
s
director
of
all
the
people
at
ibm
he
be
perhaps
the
only
one
who
move
in
the
same
social
world
as
dad
he
come
from
a
genteel
family
rode
to
the
hound
go
to
the
opera
and
belong
to
many
of
the
same
club
as
t
j
i
think
dad
be
always
a
little
resentful
of
him
after
their
reconciliation
they
agree
that
red
should
run
the
washington
office
which
enable
him
and
dad
to
give
each
other
a
wide
berth
he
knew
everybody
at
ibm
young
and
old
and
have
a
humane
and
balance
view
of
character
that
be
tremendously
helpful
to
me
another
of
dad
s
men
i
quickly
come
to
count
on
be
al
williams
i
admire
him
because
he
come
from
a
background
just
as
rough
as
dad
s
his
father
have
be
a
section
bos
in
a
coal
mine
who
get
fire
and
blackball
during
the
depression
for
side
with
the
miner
at
the
same
time
my
father
be
become
famous
as
the
high
paid
executive
in
america
the
thousand
dollar
a
day
man
al
who
be
in
accounting
school
saw
that
in
the
newspaper
and
thought
boy
they
pay
good
money
in
that
company
that
s
where
i
want
to
work
when
i
come
back
from
the
war
he
d
be
at
ibm
five
year
and
everybody
agree
he
be
outstanding
his
office
be
right
across
the
hall
from
mine
instead
of
look
as
if
he
d
come
from
a
little
mountain
town
in
pennsylvania
al
seem
like
a
graduate
of
yale
i
ask
him
how
he
get
so
smooth
and
he
be
very
open
with
me
he
say
i
found
out
people
i
admire
bought
their
clothes
at
brook
brother
so
that
s
where
i
start
buying
mine
i
notice
i
couldn
t
talk
easily
at
dinner
party
so
i
begin
to
read
the
classic
besides
work
long
and
hard
hour
he
be
try
to
make
up
for
not
go
to
college
he
have
his
day
set
up
so
that
he
get
up
at
seven
played
tennis
from
seven
thirty
to
eight
thirty
to
stay
in
shape
get
to
work
on
time
do
his
work
go
home
read
great
book
for
an
hour
have
dinner
listen
to
classical
music
for
a
while
and
go
to
bed
al
be
so
much
more
demand
of
himself
than
i
i
knew
he
d
come
to
ibm
out
of
admiration
for
dad
and
it
pleased
and
surprised
me
to
find
that
he
take
me
seriously
as
well
i
be
never
sure
that
people
i
respect
would
take
me
seriously
once
they
get
to
know
me
but
al
and
i
make
a
good
combination
he
be
totally
police
as
a
man
orderly
and
a
little
cautious
i
be
innovative
highly
motivate
and
not
cautious
at
all
with
his
cpa
and
his
financial
sense
al
make
up
for
a
big
gap
in
my
knowledge
i
never
have
any
pretension
about
understand
money
and
at
the
begin
i
didn
t
even
know
the
difference
between
debt
and
equity
in
the
company
account
but
i
never
felt
embarrass
to
ask
al
a
question
and
an
answer
from
him
be
like
an
answer
from
on
high
with
williams
and
lamotte
and
a
few
others
in
those
early
day
i
knew
i
d
found
a
team
of
my
own
father
be
famous
for
have
the
long
entry
in
who
s
who
in
america
sixteen
and
a
half
inch
in
fine
print
of
club
association
foundation
honorary
degree
and
decoration
i
doubt
very
many
people
ever
surpass
that
i
certainly
never
do
run
ibm
take
only
about
half
his
time
and
he
spent
the
rest
in
public
life
constantly
extend
his
influence
on
behalf
of
world
peace
ibm
and
t
j
watson
dad
be
by
now
as
prominent
in
reality
as
i
d
imagine
him

pure
salesmanship
of
course
and
dad
kept
it

most
of

more
serious
and

motivate
by
genuine

will
be
no

him
for
advice
and
for
his
terrific
ability
to
make
thing
happen
he
be
constantly
host
reception
and
dinner
for
member
of
the
international
community
and
the
staff
at
ibm
be
often
busy
with
un
affair
everything
from
organize
public
education
program
to
line
up

hammarskj
ld
the
first
two
secretary
general
come
to
see
dad
at
his
office
at
ibm
and
in
even
winston
churchill
sought
him
out
they
met
in
florida
dad
be
on
vacation
and
churchill
be
on
his
way
to
missouri
where
he
make
the
great
speech
in
which
he
say
an
iron
curtain
have
descend
across
the
continent
as
involve
as
my
father
have
be
with
fdr
he
shy
away
from
the
truman
white
house
he
and
truman
have
a
lot
in
common
they
both
come
from
poor
rural
background
and
both
have
strong
simple
philosophy
about
the
value
of
hard
work
honesty
and
so
on
but
i
think
dad
saw
truman
and
his
rough
missouri
friend
as
represent
a
step
backward
for
the
country
dad
give
him
the
respect
of
office
but
like
most
people
never
expect
truman
to
survive
the
election
of
and
even
after
truman
upset
tom
dewey
dad
kept
his
distance
but
the
rest
of
us
knew
the
truman
pretty
well
my
sister
jane
have
met
margaret
truman
at
the
end
of
the
war
and
they
d
become
fast
friend
when
jane
get
married
in
margaret
give
her
a
bridal
dinner
and
be
a
bridesmaid
at
the
wedding
my
brother
who
be
finish
his
last
year
at
yale
after
come
back
from
the
war
also
be
friendly
with
margaret
the
gossip
column
make
a
lot
of
the
fact
that
dick
escort
her
to
the
opera
in
new
york
and
spent
a
few
weekend
visit
her
in
washington
but
there
be
nothing
serious
behind
it
dad
be
use
the
truman
year
to
build
a
relationship
with
the
one
american
he
thought
be
as
great
as
roosevelt
dwight
eisenhower
in
everybody
knew
that
eisenhower
be
dissatisfied
serve
as
army
chief
of
staff
and
the
most
powerful
people
be
compete
for
his
attention
financier
be
offering
him
company
to
run
and
there
be
both
republican
and
democrat
who
thought
he
ought
to
be
president
nobody
knew
eisenhower
s
political
leaning
in
fact
after
fdr
die
eleanor
roosevelt
and
her
child
try
to
get
eisenhower
to
run
as
a
democrat
and
even
truman
volunteer
his
support
but
eisenhower
say
no
to
everything
he
didn
t
want
to
go
into
business
and
say
he
didn
t
feel
it
be
right
for
a
career
soldier
to
hold
high
public
office
dad
have
be
introduce
to
eisenhower
right
after
the
war
and
the
two
of
them
really
hit
it
off
eisenhower
like
businessmen
and
his
optimistic
idea
of
america
s
future
be
very
similar
to
dad
s
dad
also
understood
something
about
the
general
that
a
lot
of
people
hadn
t
figure
out
yet
eisenhower
be
ambitious
but
his
ambition
weren
t
of
the
usual
sort
he
be
just
look
for
the
best
way
to
repay
the
great
debt
he
felt
he
owe
america
he
d
start
poor
in
kansa
and
he
d
risen
to
become
a
great
hero
and
the
supreme
commander
of
all
the
allied
force
in
europe
he
want
to
spread
peace
and
the
american
way
of
life
all
over
the
world
but
he
didn
t
know
how
to
go
about
it
that
be
where
dad
come
in
he
give
eisenhower
a
transition
into
civilian
life
by
get
him
appoint
president
of
columbia
university
dad
be
a
major
benefactor
of
columbia
and
vice
chairman
of
the
board
of
trustee
by
the
end
of
the
war
columbia
s
great
president
nicholas
murray
butler
be
become
very
infirm
most
of
the
board
want
to
recruit
another
educator
to
succeed
him
dad
didn
t
object
to
that
but
he
thought
that
general
eisenhower
would
do
more
for
columbia
s
stature
than
any
professional
educator
so
dad
talk
the
board
into
let
him
go
to
the
pentagon
and
offer
eisenhower
the
job
he
told
eisenhower
you
be
a
great
hero
and
i
represent
a
great
university
we
d
like
you
to
be
its
president
the
general
say
you
ve
get
the
wrong
eisenhower
you
should
talk
to
my
brother
milton
eisenhower
s
brother
be
head
of
kansa
state
university
at
the
time
dad
kept
after
the
general
for
more
than
a
year
finally
in
the
spring
of
eisenhower
say
yes
he
and
dad
ran
columbia
together
until
eisenhower
left
three
year
later
to
head
nato
eisenhower
take
to
call
dad
his
partner
at
columbia
and
really
go
to
school
on
him
with
the
help
of
my
father
and
other
prominent
businessmen
such
as
phil
reed
of
general
electric
and
william
robinson
of
coca
cola
and
the
new
york
herald
tribune
eisenhower
get
into
the
right
club
and
onto
the
right
committee
and
learn
which
social
invitation
to
accept
and
which
to
decline
later
on
when
the
general
join
the
republican
party
dad
step
into
the
background
because
he
be
a
loyal
democrat
but
he
probably
do
as
much
as
anyone
to
get
eisenhower
ready
for
the
white
house
even
though
i
have
no
illusion
about
become
dad
s
equal
i
want
to
be
ready
to
represent
ibm
to
the
world
i
totally
believe
the
idea
he
have
drill
into
my
head
since
boyhood
that
what
a
chief
executive
do
outside
his
business
be
just
as
important
as
what
he
do
at
his
desk
so
i
set
out
to
build
my
reputation
by
do
charitable
work
and
make
friend
with
prominent
people
outside
the
business
after
the
war
dad
make
sure
that
opportunity
start
come
my
way
thing
that
be
suit
to
my
modest
ability
and
modest
pocketbook
for
instance
i
have
a
call
from
roy
larsen
the
president
of
time
inc
ask
me
to
serve
in
the
new
york
city
united
fund
drive
of
which
he
be
chairman
my
first
impulse
be
to
say
i
don
t
live
in
the
city
so
why
should
i
but
i
realize
here
be
an
eminent
man
halfway
in
age
between
my
father
and
me
i
can
work
with
him
and
learn
something
i
can
meet
other
important
people
who
be
involve
in
the
drive
that
s
the
way
it
work
out
over
the
next
few
year
i
be
invite
to
join
the
great
new
york
council
of
the
boy
scout
which
i
eventually
head
and
the
united
nation
association
to
promote
the
un
in
america
it
be
easy
to
get
involve
in
these
thing
because
i
be
t
j
watson
s
son
but
not
so
easy
for
me
actually
to
handle
myself
at
those
meeting
dad
thrive
on
be
in
the
public
eye
i
d
often
see
him
perform
at
meeting
and
dinner
in
new
york
he
d
get
up
start
work
the
room
hit
every
doggone
table
where
he
knew
anybody
shake
every
hand
and
particularly
even
if
he
be
on
the
dais
go
down
to
the
ibm
table
and
meet
all
the
men
and
their
wife
in
a
single
even
he
might
meet
four
hundred
people
i
be
different
i
didn
t
like
give
speech
or
attend
dinner
or
make
chitchat
at
cocktail
party
and
i
be
terribly
inept
at
it
but
even
if
i
didn
t
enjoy
the
meeting
i
go
to
i
always
come
home
with
a
notebook
full
of
name
a
good
businessman
need
a
lot
of
friend
cultivate
them
be
a
laborious
process
and
how
well
you
succeed
be
a
direct
result
of
how
much
effort
and
thoughtfulness
you
bring
to
bear
when
i
be
introduce
to
somebody
new
i
d
often
send
a
note
say
how
much
i
d
enjoy
meeting
him
if
my
new
acquaintance
have
express
an
interest
in
a
subject
that
i
have
a
good
book
about
i
d
send
along
a
copy
of
the
book
people
remember
gesture
like
that
for
year
i
kept
a
file
on
each
new
acquaintance
so
i
wouldn
t
be
handicapped
by
my
memory
i
note
his
or
her
name
address
telephone
number
spouse
s
name
and
so
on
i
always
make
a
note
of
where
we
d
met
and
the
person
s
specialty
or
interest
the
more
i
circulate
the
less
awkward
i
felt
and
the
more
i
learn
about
the
fine
point
of
sociability
often
these
lesson
come
in
unexpected
way
once
in
new
york
i
be
seat
next
to
governor
tom
dewey
at
a
boy
scout
luncheon
i
stuck
out
my
hand
and
say
to
him
i
m
tom
watson
jr
he
grin
and
say
you
know
you
re
do
everyone
you
meet
a
real
favor
when
you
start
a
conversation
that
way
instead
of
say
hello
governor
dewey
and
leave
me
to
guess
who
you
be
watch
what
happens
during
this
lunch
somebody
will
come
by
here
and
say
to
me
hello
tom
mary
sends
her
best
i
won
t
know
who
he
be
or
who
mary
be
and
i
ll
have
to
sit
and
be
the
damn
fool
i
thought
he
might
be
put
me
on
but
sure
enough
pretty
soon
a
man
come
up
and
say
hi
governor
i
ll
bet
you
don
t
remember
me
it
happen
all
through
the
lunch
i
always
make
a
point
of
mention
my
name
to
people
who
don
t
know
me
well
oddly
the
community
in
greenwich
connecticut
be
much
harder
to
break
into
than
new
york
olive
and
i
be
use
to
the
army
life
we
d
just
left
and
while
military
post
may
be
stodgy
and
ingrown
they
have
pleasant
custom
for
make
newcomer
feel
at
home
when
you
arrive
at
a
new
base
your
neighbor
drop
by
to
make
arrival
call
welcome
you
to
the
post
give
you
the
word
on
the
command
officer
tell
you
where
the
best
store
be
and
so
on
we
didn
t
know
that
in
greenwich
it
work
exactly
the
opposite
you
make
your
way
into
club
through
friend
if
you
have
any
but
nobody
ever
call
on
you
after
a
few
month
louis
and
grace
walker
whom
we
knew
vaguely
from
before
the
war
take
us
under
their
wing
and
we
gradually
start
get
invitation
to
dinner
party
and
country
club
john
bartol
an
executive
with
american
airline
brought
me
into
a
men
s
investment
club
where
talk
about
money
be
just
an
excuse
for
greenwich
men
to
get
together
once
a
month
in
that
club
i
met
most
of
the
young
leader
of
the
town
but
overall
olive
and
i
lead
a
fairly
seclude
life
our
household
at
first
consist
of
young
tom
a
new
baby
a
wonderful
girl
whom
we
name
jeannette
after
my
mother
and
a
nurse
we
all
squeeze
into
a
house
that
be
too
small
on
the
day
we
bought
it
after
a
couple
of
year
come
another
beautiful
baby
daughter
whom
we
name
olive
and
we
move
to
a
big
place
on
the
bank
of
a
pond
with
swan
on
weekend
the
kid
and
i
would
paddle
around
in
a
war
surplus
rubber
raft
for
fun
i
bought
a
use
sailboat
that
i
kept
at
a
local
yacht
club
the
first
sailboat
i
ever
own
it
be
call
tar
baby
it
leak
and
sail
poorly
but
it
didn
t
cost
very
much
i
use
it
in
my
first
try
at
ocean
race
i
commute
by
train
into
the
city
every
day
i
thought
the
station
platform
be
an
excite
place
there
be
a
newspaper
to
buy
and
my
group
of
acquaintance
slowly
grow
so
there
be
often
someone
to
say
hello
to
and
there
be
always
the
challenge
of
find
the
right
spot
on
the
platform
so
that
when
the
train
pull
in
i
could
get
a
seat
alone
or
one
next
to
someone
i
knew
we
all
rode
on
fifty
trip
ticket
and
it
cost
less
than
a
dollar
to
get
into
new
york
i
start
out
catch
an
early
train
to
make
sure
i
get
to
work
by
nine
but
before
long
i
figure
out
there
be
a
smarter
way
to
commute
the
people
on
my
usual
train
be
all
worker
bee
young
fellow
on
their
way
up
who
have
to
get
to
the
office
on
time
old
more
successful
businessmen
generally
skip
the
early
train
and
from
time
to
time
i
d
arrange
my
schedule
at
ibm
so
i
could
ride
later
too
in
this
way
i
get
to
know
some
of
the
most
influential
businessmen
in
new
york
such
as
stanley
resor
who
with
his
wife
have
built
j
walter
thompson
into
one
of
the
world
s
top
advertising
agency
the
man
i
value
the
most
on
those
train
ride
be
old
george
w
davison
the
retire
chairman
of
the
central
hanover
bank
which
later
become
manufacturer
hanover
father
have
introduce
us
originally
and
the
time
i
spent
rid
with
davison
and
listen
to
his
observation
be
almost
as
valuable
as
the
time
i
spent
with
dad
i
like
davison
from
the
minute
we
start
talk
the
first
advice
he
ever
give
me
be
on
the
subject
of
height
davison
be
tall
in
wisdom
tall
in
knowledge
tall
in
his
way
of
relate
to
the
world
but
physically
he
be
only
about
five
foot
eight
inch
he
say
this
be
not
a
fair
world
don
t
get
the
idea
that
all
the
good
be
reward
or
all
the
bad
be
punish
you
can
start
right
in
with
how
tall
you
be
it
s
a
lot
easy
to
be
a
success
when
you
re
tall
because
people
notice
you
then
he
smile
and
say
on
the
other
hand
it
also
help
to
be
smart
and
i
m
smart
davison
must
have
heard
from
dad
about
my
tendency
to
blow
my
stack
because
he
be
always
talk
about
the
need
for
self
control
in
business
he
taught
me
the
expression
what
you
haven
t
say
you
can
say
any
time
that
still
come
back
to
me
when
i
m
about
to
send
a
scathing
letter
that
i
may
end
up
regret
i
don
t
always
follow
davison
s
advice
but
at
least
i
remember
it
i
always
felt
as
if
i
have
to
be
on
my
toe
when
i
be
around
men
like
davison
but
dad
told
me
that
be
a
good
thing
he
say
don
t
make
friend
who
be
comfortable
to
be
with
make
friend
who
will
force
you
to
lever
yourself
up
do
that
broaden
me
but
i
have
to
get
through
some
awfully
rough
moment
one
night
in
davison
have
olive
and
me
to
dinner
at
his
house
there
be
a
couple
of
other
executive
from
the
central
hanover
bank
with
their
wife
and
there
be
a
guest
of
honor
a
spaniard
name
admiral
luis
de
flores
de
flores
be
a
dramatic
fellow
with
a
turn
up
mustache
who
have
flown
in
world
war
i
and
invent
a
number
of
instrument
for
airplane
his
late
project
be
more
along
ibm
s
line
he
and
his
son
have
design
an
electronic
filing
system
for
library
and
the
central
hanover
people
have
put
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
dollar
into
it
we
have
a
good
dinner
and
then
we
men
repair
to
the
library
for
brandy
no
sooner
be
the
door
close
than
davison
s
colleague
really
let
me
have
it
they
say
de
flores
be
go
to
eat
ibm
up
with
his
library
system
of
course
it
should
have
be
obvious
that
library
rarely
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
fancy
technology
instead
i
thought
gee
here
we
have
this
multi
million
dollar
research
budget
and
this
spaniard
be
beating
us
all
the
same
it
steam
me
up
that
davison
should
let
his
men
gang
up
on
me
when
it
be
time
to
leave
the
library
and
rejoin
the
lady
i
say
just
a
minute
gentleman
i
d
like
to
propose
a
bet
if
any
of
you
would
like
to
buy
three
thousand
dollar
worth
of
de
flores
s
stock
tomorrow
i
ll
be
glad
to
buy
three
thousand
dollar
worth
of
ibm
stock
then
we
ll
wait
five
year
if
ibm
go
up
more
than
de
flores
i
ll
take
your
stock
and
if
de
flores
go
up
more
you
can
have
mine
nobody
want
to
bet
within
a
year
de
flores
be
defunct
to
my
relief
even
though
i
have
nothing
against
him
personally
i
doubt
that
it
be
ever
davison
s
intention
to
put
me
through
the
wringer
like
that
but
it
s
an
illustration
of
what
it
mean
to
have
those
difficult
friend
dad
recommend
surprisingly
i
make
my
best
contact
in
the
business
community
not
through
dad
but
through
old
fred
nichol

before
charley

of
senior

marshall
plan
twice
a
year
these
men
would
meet
and
tell
all
their
business
sin
the
format
be
very
simple
each
meeting
start
with
an
extend
presentation
a
member
would
get
up
and
give
a
history
of
his
company
this
be
do
on
a
rotation
system
so
that
each
company
come
up
every
five
year
or
so
then
we
d
go
alphabetically
through
the
entire
group
and
each
man
would
give
a
fifteen
or
twenty
minute
report
on
the
state
of
his
business
i
learn
more
about
manage
salesman
than
a
hundred
business
school
could
have
taught
me
tip
for
hire
way
to
set
up
incentive
mistake
to
avoid
and
so
on
many
of
the
men
be
as
old
as
dad
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
listen
to
al
fuller
the
entrepreneur
who
found
the
fuller
brush
company
he
told
me
how
he
d
start
out
drive
a
streetcar
in
hartford
each
day
by
quit
time
he
d
have
so
much
grime
under
his
fingernail
that
he
couldn
t
get
them
clean
so
he
and
his
wife
start
experiment
with
make
brush
finally
they
invent
a
machine
that
could
make
a
brush
out
of
the
bristle
of
a
hog
held
in
place
by
twist
wire
on
that
foundation
and
the
new
concept
of
door
to
door
sell
they
built
a
large
business
and
a
great
fortune
the
old
men
still
rule
the
roost
at
the
asse
but
the
young
generation
be
come
in
and
i
found
a
couple
of
men
my
own
age
who
become
lifelong
friend
the
first
be
bob
galvin
who
take
motorola
from
his
father
the
founder
when
it
be
still
a
small
manufacturer
of
car
radio
and
make
it
into
an
electronics
giant
another
friend
be
charles
percy
who
be
then
know
as
the
boy
wonder
run
bell
howell
and
later
become
a
u
s
senator
the
thing
i
particularly
love
about
the
asse
be
that
other
people
saw
me
as
distinct
from
my
father
and
give
me
a
certain
amount
of
respect
accordingly
everybody
knew
ibm
be
go
like
gangbusters
and
when
we
talk
about
say
a
trend
in
employee
benefit
somebody
would
always
ask
what
have
you
do
about
that
tom
i
d
sit
up
late
into
the
night
and
shoot
the
bull
with
these
men
i
want
to
be
able
to
sell
ibm
equipment
to
every
business
so
i
try
to
learn
the
wrinkle
of
each
industry
and
the
culture
of
each
company
i
d
go
back
to
ibm
full
of
new
idea
and
never
let
on
where
my
inspiration
be
come
from
once
i
d
be
around
ibm
for
several
year
dad
decide
i
be
ready
to
join
the
business
advisory
council
and
he
set
it
up
so
that
i
take
over
his
seat
in
this
be
a
tremendous
public
compliment
his
way
of
broadcasting
to
the
world
his
great
confidence
in
me
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
learn
more
from
go
to
the
asse
the
business
advisory
council
be
a
federal
advisory
group
that
date
from
the
new
deal
when
daniel
roper
roosevelt
s
first
secretary
of
commerce
organize
it
to
try
to
win
the
cooperation
of
top
businessmen
in
the
s
there
wasn
t
very
much
for
the
council
to
do
but
it
have
become
the
most
prestigious
forum
for
businessmen
in
america
and
represent
a
tremendous
concentration
of
power
dad
arrange
the
invitation
without
my
knowledge
at
a
banquet
i
found
myself
seat
next
to
the
business
council
chairman
john
collyer
of
b
f
goodrich
he
ask
if
i
knew
anything
about
the
council
and
i
say
no
that
must
have
seem
stupid
because
later
on
i
realize
that
everyone
knew
about
the
business
council
but
collyer
patiently
explain
what
it
be
and
ask
if
i
would
like
to
join
at
least
i
knew
enough
to
say
i
d
be
flatter
it
be
a
great
privilege
to
belong
but
for
me
it
could
also
be
agony
each
year
the
council
met
a
couple
of
time
at
the
homestead
a
luxurious
hotel
in
hot
spring
virginia
these
meeting
always
begin
with
a
black
tie
dinner
and
everyone
brought
his
wife
olive
and
i
be
the
young
people
there
we
d
sit
in
our
room
wonder
what
time
it
be
appropriate
to
go
down
to
cocktail
and
pore
over
a
little
book
they
give
you
try
to
memorize
name
and
face
i
remember
be
put
off
by
something
i
saw
at
the
first
dinner
one
member
be
a
powerful
railroad
man
from
out
west
and
during
the
cocktail
hour
he
have
a
few
drink
then
on
his
way
into
the
dinner
walk
across
the
ballroom
with
his
little
wife
he
fell
down
flat
on
his
face
everybody
gasped
but
it
turn
out
this
be
a
trick
he
could
do
arch
his
body
slightly
and
turn
his
head
so
he
wouldn
t
kill
himself
when
he
fell
he
get
up
and
everybody
roar
and
applaud
then
he
do
it
again
and
again
he
be
all
cover
with
dust
from
the
floor
it
be
a
shock
to
see
such
slapstick
from
one
of
america
s
business
leader
the
majority
of
the
people
to
whom
we
be
introduce
be
somewhat
cool
to
us
they
knew
we
be
democrat
for
one
thing
and
big
business
be
still
as
overwhelmingly
republican
as
it
have
be
in
roosevelt
s
day
also
i
wasn
t
the
head
of
ibm
yet
and
a
lot
of
people
must
have
thought
dad
be
jumping
the
gun
by
have
me
there
more
than
once
i
felt
so
out
of
place
that
i
told
olive
we
should
go
back
to
new
york
i
do
that
know
i
could
count
on
her
to
persuade
me
to
stay
for
ibm
s
sake
my
grow
prominence
begin
to
get
on
dad
s
nerve
he
want
to
make
me
the
head
of
ibm
but
he
didn
t
like
share
the
limelight
so
he
be
contradictory
in
his
attitude
toward
me
when
i
wasn
t
around
he
d
tell
people
that
i
be
a
world
beater
and
that
without
question
i
be
go
to
run
the
company
someday
but
then
dad
would
see
me
accomplish
something
he
d
be
in
the
audience
when
i
give
a
speech
or
he
d
read
in
the
paper
that
i
d
join
a
charity
board
and
he
wouldn
t
say
a
word
about
it
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
dad
wasn
t
always
so
comfortable
with
the
idea
that
tom
watson
jr
be
make
a
name
for
himself
this
be
a
side
of
dad
i
have
never
know
be
there
during
all
my
year
as
an
aimless
boy
make
poor
grade
in
school
he
d
give
me
nothing
but
love
and
support
as
a
young
salesman
i
d
gotten
so
much
help
it
be
embarrass
and
as
i
go
into
the
business
community
dad
quietly
saw
to
it
that
all
kind
of
door
be
spring
open
but
when
it
come
to
power
real
power
of
the
kind
he
held
over
the
life
of
ten
of
thousand
of
people
my
father
make
me
fight
him
for
every
scrap
that
s
why
i
get
so
upset
in
when
it
look
to
me
as
if
dad
be
about
to
hand
over
half
of
ibm
to
my
brother
i
be
now
a
vice
president
but
dick
have
stayed
in
the
army
and
then
go
back
to
yale
where
he
finish
a
bachelor
s
degree
with
a
major
in
international
relation
he
d
be
at
ibm
less
than
a
year
and
be
just
get
start
as
a
salesman
i
definitely
thought
of
him
as
my
junior
in
the
company
but
dad
be
an
old
man
in
a
hurry
he
have
dream
of
his
two
boy
run
ibm
together
and
with
his
seventy
fifth
birthday
loom
he
knew
there
might
not
be
time
to
put
dick
through
the
same
tough
apprenticeship
i
d
have
he
need
to
set
dick
up
in
a
way
that
would
allow
the
two
of
us
to
work
together
and
not
fight
too
much
because
someday
there
would
be
no
one
around
to
arbitrate
for
year
before
i
have
any
success
of
my
own
the
idea
of
dick
get
ahead
really
bother
me
even
though
he
be
five
year
young
i
thought
he
be
in
many
way
my
superior
he
d
gotten
into
yale
and
his
grade
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
well
than
mine
have
be
in
college
he
be
a
well
athlete
he
have
a
natural
command
of
language
and
an
easy
way
of
relate
to
other
people
he
be
much
more
gracious
a
relaxed
guy
very
charm
he
could
sing
and
he
could
yodel
and
he
be
a
real
entertainer
at
party
see
dick
do
so
well
have
make
me
feel
like
the
black
sheep
i
thought
people
admire
him
because
he
live
up
to
what
dad
want
and
i
didn
t
but
i
begin
to
resent
dick
much
less
after
my
success
during
the
war
now
i
have
great
ambition
for
myself
and
also
felt
warmly
toward
him
he
be
my
brother
and
i
want
him
to
succeed
too
my
gripe
be
with
dad
it
burn
me
up
that
he
seem
to
see
us
as
total
equal
i
d
be
at
ibm
three
year
before
the
war
and
almost
three
year
since
they
weren
t
all
happy
year
but
i
want
credit
for
them
and
here
be
dick
who
d
be
in
the
company
eight
month
be
hand
the
world
on
a
silver
platter
dad
s
idea
be
to
give
me
the
u
s
a
and
dick
everything
else
he
make
a
place
for
dick
by
take
our
office
and
factory
on
six
continent
and
form
a
subsidiary
company
it
be
call
ibm
world
trade
and
it
be
the
great
labor
of
my
father
s
old
age
look
back
on
it
today
i
d
say
it
be
one
of
the
most
astonish
accomplishment
in
dad
s
long
career
and
just
as
dad
want
dick
take
it
and
ran
it
flawlessly
make
it
everything
dad
hop
it
would
be
but
when
dad
first
thought
it
up
i
fought
him
harder
on
it
than
i
d
ever
fought
before
i
buck
so
hard
that
i
damn
near
get
disown
our
foreign
operation
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
be
pretty
thin
ibm
have
score
of
office
and
factory
abroad
we
be
represent
in
seventy
eight
country
unfortunately
that
number
be
much
more
impressive
than
the
profit
generate
in
for
example
only
about
one
eighth
of
ibm
s
profit
come
from
abroad
and
of
course
the
percentage
fell
during
the
war
the
foreign
department
as
it
be
call
seem
pretty
unimportant
compare
with
our
boom
business
in
the
u
s
but
dad
thought
otherwise
i
can
remember
go
to
a
meeting
in
the
spring
of
where
i
watch
him
chew
out
charley
kirk
and
george
phillips
about
the
wretched
state
of
our
overseas
business
he
call
it
nothing
short
of
a
disgrace
which
wasn
t
really
fair
because
the
lion
s
share
of
foreign
sale
always
come
from
europe
which
be
in
a
shamble
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
dad
declare
that
we
must
set
up
the
foreign
department
as
a
separate
company
and
make
it
stand
on
its
own
but
he
give
no
specific
order
and
everyone
figure
he
be
just
blowing
off
steam
a
couple
of
month
later
i
come
up
with
an
idea
that
help
revive
the
european
operation
the
problem
over
there
be
not
lack
of
demand
many
of
our
customer
have
survive
the
war
and
be
eager
to
get
punch
card
machine
but
our
office
found
it
almost
impossible
to
deliver
the
right
gear
they
be
cripple
by
shortage
and
by
widespread
import
restriction
that
make
it
impossible
to
bring
in
new
machine
an
inspiration
come
to
me
at
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
woke
up
and
say
as
be
machine
the
american
arm
force
have
be
turn
in
million
of
dollar
worth
of
punch
card
equipment
that
be
no
longer
need
we
take
those
machine
some
with
the
mud
of
the
battlefield
still
on
them
and
sent
them
to
the
european
factory
to
be
refurbish
at
first
people
thought
our
employee
would
be
insult
to
be
give
use
dirty
equipment
to
fix
but
they
love
it
when
they
saw
that
with
a
few
hour
work
and
a
new
coat
of
paint
those
machine
be
something
they
could
sell
as
far
as
dad
s
idea
of
set
up
a
world
trade
subsidiary
be
concerned
i
give
it
no
more
thought
but
a
year
or
two
later
after
dick
join
the
company
it
hit
me
that
our
international
operation
be
reinvesting
a
large
portion
of
their
profit
rather
than
turn
the
money
over
to
ibm
in
new
york
i
discover
this
because
we
need
the
cash
to
keep
grow
in
the
u
s
expand
a
rental
operation
require
a
lot
of
dollar
the
then
manager
of
the
foreign
department
be
a
big
genial
fellow
name
joe
wilson
when
i
call
him
in
to
ask
where
the
profit
be
go
he
say
dad
have
order
him
to
try
to
expand
abroad
as
rapidly
as
we
be
do
in
the
u
s
i
thought
that
be
utter
folly
but
dad
ignore
me
before
long
i
heard
him
talk
again
about
splitting
off
the
foreign
department
he
want
it
to
have
its
own
executive
its
own
board
of
director
and
much
more
autonomy
to
do
the
great
thing
he
expect
with
an
enormous
leap
of
logic
he
say
the
united
state
have
six
percent
of
the
world
s
population
and
the
rest
of
the
world
have
ninety
four
percent
someday
the
world
trade
company
be
go
to
be
large
than
the
u
s
company
my
friend
al
williams
for
one
thought
this
be
very
profound
but
i
thought
dad
be
be
simplistic
and
naive
we
have
endless
opportunity
and
little
risk
in
the
u
s
it
seem
to
me
while
it
be
hard
to
imagine
us
get
anywhere
abroad
latin
america
for
example
seem
like
a
bottomless
pit
many
of
those
country
be
run
their
economy
in
such
a
way
that
for
us
ever
to
make
a
dollar
and
get
it
home
be
go
to
be
impossible
meanwhile
even
with
the
success
of
as
be
machine
our
business
in
europe
be
far
from
healthy
trade
be
still
paralyze
the
marshall
plan
be
only
on
the
draw
board
and
it
be
unclear
when
we
d
ever
be
able
to
start
manufacturing
again
the
solution
my
father
come
up
with
show
how
resourceful
he
really
be
he
invent
a
way
for
ibm
s
office
in
europe
to
have
their
own
free
trade
across
international
border
within
ibm
he
create
a
kind
of
common
market
ten
year
before
the
real
one
exist
and
unlike
the
common
market
my
father
s
work
right
from
the
start
our
european
factory
be
not
giant
plant
like
endicott
or
poughkeepsie
the
big
one
employ
about
two
hundred
people
and
the
rest
be
more
like
shop
dad
make
these
little
unit
dependent
on
one
another
he
come
up
with
the
simple
rule
that
each
factory
have
to
make
part
not
only
for
the
country
in
which
it
be
situate
but
also
for
export
so
if
you
be
make
keypunch
mechanism
in
france
perhaps
percent
of
your
output
would
be
use
in
machine
for
the
french
market
but
percent
have
to
be
export
to
assembly
line
somewhere
else
in
italy
and
germany
say
by
shipping
those
part
you
earn
foreign
exchange
credit
which
you
then
could
use
to
import
part
of
some
other
type
that
for
instance
a
dutch
ibm
plant
might
be
make
for
you
because
tariff
barrier
be
so
high
we
ship
finish
machine
only
to
the
small
country
where
we
have
no
plant
and
few
ibm
machine
be
percent
manufacture
in
the
country
where
they
be
finally
assemble
this
trading
around
allow
us
to
operate
on
a
much
large
scale
and
far
more
efficiently
than
any
company
that
be
bound
to
a
single
country
dad
s
second
great
innovation
before
turn
world
trade
over
to
dick
be
to
hire
down
and
out
aristocrat
and
use
their
connection
to
get
our
business
roll
again
dad
have
always
be
inclined
toward
highborn
people
and
by
now
he
have
the
necessary
prestige
to
attract
them
to
ibm
when
they
need
work
even
though
the
form
of
government
have
change
in
most
european
country
dad
understood
that
the
aristocracy
have
sell
power
sometimes
he
d
find
out
he
d
gotten
a
man
who
be
dead
from
the
neck
up
but
most
of
those
he
picked
do
very
well
baron
daubek
of
rumania
cover
all
of
eastern
europe
he
have
so
much
brass
that
he
d
fly
in
behind
the
iron
curtain
and
collect
rental
from
the
guy
who
have
take
our
company
away
another
of
our
aristocrat
be

huguenot
who
become
know
as
mister
ibm
of
france
he
be
a
frail
look
but
tough
man
who
built
up
ibm
to
be
one
of
france
s
large
company
de
waldner
would
fight
with
anybody
to
get
what
he
thought
the
company
need
he
even
convince
dad
that
to
succeed
in
france
ibm
have
to
bend
to
local
custom
go
so
far
as
to
serve
wine
at
lunch
in
the
cafeteria
dad
didn
t
advertise
the
fact
that
he
be
clearing
the
way
for
my
brother
until
he
take
dick
around
europe
with
him
in
late
it
be
dad
s
first
visit
to
the
continent
after
the
war
he
travel
around
for
several
month
organize
his
factory
and
renew
old
tie
and
he
kept
dick
with
him
the
entire
time
introduce
him
as
his
assistant
that
make
it
pretty
clear
to
everybody
who
ibm
s
next
great
internationalist
be
go
to
be
i
wish
i
d
thought
back
on
my
own
experience
of
have
sale
push
my
way
and
realize
how
hard
thing
must
be
for
my
brother
as
the
young
in
our
family
he
be
low
man
on
the
totem
pole
not
only
do
he
have
dad
over
him
but
he
have
me
five
year
in
front
to
complicate
thing
still
far
there
be
our
sister
jane
who
be
always
dad
s
favorite
so
dick
grow
up
in
a
very
very
tough
position
maybe
because
of
this
dick
s
relationship
with
dad
be
different
from
mine
if
dad
get
mad
at
me
i
d
get
mad
right
back
and
we
d
fight
my
brother
have
just
as
strong
a
temper
as
i
do
but
he
seem
to
believe
that
in
order
to
get
ahead
he
have
to
take
what
t
j
dish
out
knuckle
under
be
traumatic
for
dick
he
have
asthma
and
sometimes
when
my
father
lit
into
him
he
d
get
so
short
of
breath
he
d
need
a
shot
of
adrenaline
to
bring
his
breathing
back
to
normal
i
be
amaze
at
how
far
dick
let
dad
go
that
tour
they
take
of
europe
for
example
be
suppose
to
be
my
brother
s
honeymoon
in
june
of
he
d
married
a
superb
girl
from
syracuse
new
york
name
nancy
hemingway
they
be
go
to
sail
to
england
and
of
all
the
pushy
thing
dad
ask
if
he
and
mother
could
go
along
i
think
dad
may
have
felt
his
time
be
run
out
dick
must
have
have
misgiving
about
combine
his
honeymoon
with
a
business
trip
but
he
say
yes
so
off
they
sail
the
four
of
them
together
even
then
dad
didn
t
let
up
one
night
they
be
in
stockholm
stay
at
the
grand
hotel
and
be
schedule
to
have
dinner
with
the
king
of
sweden
when
it
be
time
to
leave
dad
notice
that
nancy
s
dress
wasn
t
floor
length
he
ask
her
do
you
have
a
long
dress
and
she
explain
nervously
that
she
hadn
t
brought
one
along
dad
lit
into
her
and
say
you
be
go
to
disgrace
me
and
my
family
and
nancy
burst
into
tear
that
be
where
dick
finally
drew
the
line
he
say
look
old
man
you
can
tell
me
anything
you
want
because
i
m
your
son
but
don
t
talk
to
nancy
that
way
she
be
my
wife
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
that
really
knock
dad
back
he
apologize
and
they
go
and
nancy
din
with
the
king
in
her
short
dress
dad
come
back
from
that
trip
and
sat
down
with
me
in
october
to
tell
me
how
he
be
go
to
divide
up
the
world
world
trade
dick
s
company
would
build
and
sell
machine
everywhere
except
the
united
state
ibm
domestic
my
side
would
be
confine
to
the
continental
u
s
but
as
the
parent
company
it
would
also
handle
aspect
of
the
business
like
financing
and
research
and
development
for
all
of
ibm
for
the
time
be
dad
be
go
to
add
the
chairmanship
of
world
trade
to
his
usual
duty
with
a
senior
man
name
harrison
chauncey
as
number
two
and
dick
as
a
vice
president
the
same
rank
i
have
i
told
dad
that
splitting
off
world
trade
be
the
bad
idea
i
d
ever
heard
i
say
darkly
if
you
do
this
you
ll
live
to
regret
it
he
look
at
me
with
total
innocence
and
say
why
do
you
object
to
this
so
much
there
be
a
lot
of
plausible
business
argument
i
could
have
use
but
the
question
caught
me
so
completely
off
guard
that
the
only
thing
that
come
to
mind
be
personal
there
s
no
place
for
me
to
travel
i
like
to
travel
that
make
my
father
smile
well
he
say
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
give
you
alaska
hawaii
and
puerto
rico
and
you
can
travel
there
i
be
so
embarrass
that
i
agree
and
left
his
office
feel
totally
stymie
later
that
week
he
call
me
in
this
time
with
dick
to
discus
the
plan
again
i
start
to
present
my
business
objection
one
at
a
time
set
up
world
trade
would
only
multiply
bureaucracy
and
expense
i
say
and
i
predict
that
the
minute
world
trade
be
separate
it
would
start
develop
its
own
product
thereby
wreck
ibm
s
manufacturing
efficiency
dick
take
the
diplomatic
course
of
sit
by
and
not
say
a
word
but
i
sense
a
rise
tide
of
impatience
in
dad
the
objection
that
finally
cause
him
to
flash
be
my
press
him
on
who
should
get
canada
our
business
there
produce
a
big
cash
flow
and
i
hat
to
lose
it
there
be
no
reason
for
give
canada
to
world
trade
except
that
they
need
the
cash
more
than
we
do
it
be
a
real
weak
spot
in
dad
s
plan
i
could
see
him
bristle
and
i
really
bore
in
i
say
anybody
can
see
that
canada
belongs
with
the
domestic
company
if
world
trade
can
t
stand
on
its
own
without
canada
then
you
shouldn
t
split
it
off
at
all
dad
rise
up
and
thunder
what
be
you
try
to
do
prevent
your
brother
from
have
an
opportunity
those
word
kill
me
they
set
me
up
against
my
brother
who
be
right
there
dad
would
say
that
kind
of
thing
without
think
because
he
always
aim
to
win
he
use
the
marquis
of
queensberry
rule
if
he
have
time
to
think
about
them
but
when
he
be
in
a
corner
it
didn
t
matter
what
the
rule
be
he
want
to
accomplish
his
purpose
there
be
really
nothing
more
i
could
say
dick
and
i
rode
down
in
the
elevator
with
dad
and
walk
him
outside
to
where
he
have
a
limousine
wait
he
get
in
and
roll
down
the
window
and
say
now
remember
boy
stay
together
i
be
devastate
dick
and
i
go
back
upstairs
and
i
try
to
paper
over
the
rift
between
us
by
say
i
hadn
t
meant
anything
personal
have
won
his
point
dick
be
generous
enough
not
to
rub
it
in
the
old
man
go
ahead
and
organize
the
ibm
world
trade
company
in
early
formally
splitting
it
off
as
a
wholly
own
subsidiary
a
year
later
most
of
my
fear
turn
out
to
be
unfounded
world
trade
do
not
drag
ibm
down
it
capitalize
on
europe
s
economic
recovery
finance
itself
through
its
own
profit
and
foreign
borrowing
and
grow
as
fast
as
the
american
company
dad
do
not
insult
me
by
give
dick
equal
rank
he
make
dick
a
vice
president
sure
enough
but
he
also
give
me
the
big
promotion
i
d
be
work
so
hard
to
earn
in
september
of
i
become
executive
vice
president
the
job
kirk
have
when
he
die
i
didn
t
even
lose
my
dream
of
chance
to
travel
in
europe
since
the
u
s
army
stayed
there
in
force
and
its
punch
card
installation
be
the
responsibility
of
the
domestic
ibm
there
be
ample
opportunity
for
me
to
go
around
inspect
as
my
brother
rise
at
world
trade
i
make
great
effort
to
stay
out
of
his
way
and
help
in
any
manner
i
could
i
bow
out
of
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
so
he
could
take
my
place
i
take
him
to
a
meeting
of
the
american
society
of
sale
executive
and
introduce
him
around
i
avoid
any
discussion
of
european
business
or
international
affair
later
on
when
he
need
executive
who
knew
how
to
twist
tail
and
produce
result
i
sent
him
some
of
my
best
men
most
notably
gilbert
jones
my
former
executive
assistant
whom
dick
chose
many
year
later
as
his
successor
as
chairman
of
world
trade
i
thought
dick
be
extraordinarily
able
and
in
our
off
hour
we
grow
very
close
we
often
take
our
wife
and
child
on
ski
trip
together
and
nancy
and
olive
become
best
friend
none
of
this
be
enough
to
defuse
the
tension
in
our
family
dad
remain
suspicious
that
i
be
secretly
out
to
undermine
my
brother
and
dick
take
his
cue
from
dad
played
very
close
to
the
vest
he
would
discus
world
trade
with
dad
but
never
with
me
the
situation
make
it
very
difficult
over
the
next
few
year
for
the
three
of
us
to
do
business
there
be
aspect
of
world
trade
in
which
the
domestic
company
have
to
be
involve
since
we
be
the
parent
important
matter
like
financing
and
product
planning
but
when
dad
and
dick
and
i
would
meet
to
talk
about
ibm
s
future
there
be
constant
strife
even
the
small
difference
of
opinion
between
dick
and
me
would
cause
dad
to
question
my
motif
and
this
in
turn
lead
to
bitter
fight
always
between
dad
and
me
with
dick
sit
silently
by
usually
this
happen
behind
close
door
but
at
one
point
i
blew
up
at
them
in
public
we
be
at
the
metropolitan
club
and
dad
told
me
to
keep
my
opinion
on
europe
to
myself
i
completely
lose
my
temper
told
them
that
one
business
could
not
have
two
head
and
swear
loudly
at
both
my
father
and
dick
i
storm
out
i
don
t
remember
the
detail
but
i
remember
the
outcome
because
i
thought
it
be
the
end
of
my
ibm
career
i
spent
the
night
paralyze
with
remorse
for
my
outburst
the
next
morning
dad
buzz
me
up
to
his
office
young
man
he
say
if
you
fail
in
ibm
or
in
life
it
will
be
because
your
temper
do
you
in
he
dismiss
me
without
let
me
say
a
word
that
be
just
as
well
because
too
much
be
at
stake
we
be
right
on
the
brink
of
estrangement
both
of
us
felt
it
and
neither
of
us
want
to
jump
over
the
edge
dad
come
very
close
to
fire
me
many
year
later
after
his
death
i
found
a
note
he
have
draft
at
the
time
it
be
write
in
pencil
on
the
back
of
a
luncheon
menu
and
it
say
i
give
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
this
relationship
between
dick
and
you
and
come
to
the
decision
that
if
the
past
difference
be
to
continue
you
and
he
must
part
i
be
write
this
as
i
want
you
to
have
plenty
of
time
to
look
about
fortunately
he
never
sent
it
i
d
have
felt
shatter
but
the
immediate
consequence
would
have
be
to
escalate
the
fight
i
d
have
go
to
him
and
say
you
re
threaten
me
let
s
get
this
out
on
the
table
right
now
i
be
very
peppery
with
him
and
i
ve
often
wonder
whether
i
behave
that
way
because
of
courage
or
because
i
thought
i
have
power
over
him
as
his
firstborn
i
never
could
decide
which
but
dad
knew
it
be
much
more
effective
to
let
me
stew
in
guilt
the
more
i
thought
about
my
outburst
the
more
miserable
i
felt
the
only
way
to
be
sure
of
end
one
of
our
battle
be
to
write
i
have
quite
a
collection
of
the
apology
i
sent
him
during
the
year
after
the
war
follow
the
incident
at
the
metropolitan
club
i
write
him
this
dear
dad
i
have
give
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
what
you
say
about
my
temper
and
believe
that
you
have
put
your
finger
on
the
one
thing
which
can
bring
to
an
end
a
career
which
otherwise
can
be
very
successful
the
lack
of
control
of
temper
and
the
tendency
to
think
last
and
speak
first
be
something
which
have
hamper
me
in
my
dealing
not
only
with
you
but
with
my
own
family
my
business
associate
and
my
friend
my
last
break
at
the
metropolitan
club
and
my
swear
at
you
be
an
act
which
i
will
never
forget
and
from
which
my
heart
will
never
fully
recover
family
conference
with
you
and
dick
be
something
that
i
ve
look
forward
to
all
my
life
and
for
me
to
thoroughly
ruin
one
of
our
first
be
something
for
which
i
owe
not
only
you
but
also
dick
a
real
apology
you
mention
how
you
want
to
feel
that
i
would
and
could
take
a
place
as
a
rally
point
for
the
family
as
its
old
and
really
if
i
can
successfully
do
this
it
will
fulfill
my
great
ambition
of
course
you
can
never
have
confidence
in
my
ability
to
do
so
until
i
prove
to
you
that
i
can
control
tom
watson
jr
and
think
before
i
speak
you
be
a
practical
businessman
and
have
built
ibm
on
fact
not
promise
believe
me
i
have
and
will
continue
to
pay
for
my
statement
at
the
met
club
but
that
s
my
fault
if
you
see
fit
to
watch
from
now
on
you
ll
see
a
change
that
will
please
you
temper
will
be
watch
and
also
stupid
jealousy
and
i
ll
be
a
different
and
well
son
and
brother
with
sincere
intention
great
love
tom
this
be
one
of
our
bad
clash
but
dad
and
i
get
into
big
argument
practically
every
month
we
d
reconcile
and
try
to
cooperate
but
pretty
soon
he
d
second
guess
me
on
a
decision
or
i
d
express
an
opinion
on
something
he
thought
be
none
of
my
business
and
we
d
go
at
it
again
in
retrospect
i
realize
what
a
toll
these
flare
ups
must
have
take
on
dad
another
of
the
paper
he
left
at
his
death
be
a
meditation
he
write
around
his
seventy
fifth
birthday
from
the
way
it
read
he
be
smart
from
something
i
say
i
ve
obviously
accuse
him
of
drive
able
executive
out
of
ibm
so
he
can
surround
himself
with
yes
men
he
feel
depressed
and
haunt
by
the
name
of
those
who
have
die
or
quit
or
be
fire
he
think
dick
and
i
be
anxious
for
him
to
leave
something
he
s
fiercely
determine
not
to
do
nobody
should
have
the
right
to
challenge
my
knowledge
of
ibm
due
to
my
year
experience
think
what
i
could
have
do
with
the
guidance
of
someone
of
experience
i
will
give
all
i
have
get
to
leave
ibm
with
enough
people
in
the
executive
end
who
believe
in
me
joe
rogers
fred
nichol
and
charlie
kirk
titus
ogsbury
all
help
me
the
latter
thought
my
policy
be
not
good
they
brought
great
damage
to
us
that
be
why
i
have
to
let
out
two
vice
president
that
be
the
hardest
job
i
ever
do
in
my
whole
work
in
ibm
but
i
have
to
do
it
the
reason
i
m
stick
on
the
job
work
be
because
the
lead
industrialist
and
banker
of
the
world
seem
to
be
unanimous
that
i
have
accomplish
something
worthwhile
in
building
a
sound
business
in
establish
certain
policy
which
have
proven
to
be
beneficial
to
all
of
the
employee
of
ibm
last
but
not
least
to
the
public
we
serve
the
stockholder
who
entrust
us
with
their
investment
the
moral
to
this
be
it
have
always
be
my
hope
ambition
that
my
two
son
would
be
ambitious
determine
to
prepare
themselves
to
carry
on
the
ibm
company
put
the
name
of
watson
far
above
its
present
stand
in
the
industrial
social
economic
world
as
a
result
they
will
each
have
a
great
opportunity
to
be
of
service
to
their
family
relative
worthwhile
institution
and
deserve
people
everywhere
i
be
equally
proud
of
both
my
son
and
i
m
also
proud
of
what
they
have
accomplish
in
the
short
time
of
their
respective
service
with
the
company
and
i
know
that
both
my
son
realize
that
experience
be
the
great
teacher
i
m
glad
i
never
saw
the
note
at
the
time
i
d
have
felt
guilty
as
hell
and
probably
i
d
have
gotten
mad
because
dad
make
it
sound
as
if
our
apprenticeship
be
never
go
to
end
i
d
have
start
fight
all
over
again
it
didn
t
occur
to
me
then
but
i
suspect
that
my
sister
jane
be
behind
some
of
these
dispute
jane
have
dad
s
ear
and
at
that
stage
in
our
life
she
and
i
didn
t
get
along
very
well
she
d
have
see
the
world
trade
issue
in
term
of
rivalry
because
she
be
so
competitive
herself
if
you
have
to
pick
who
be
the
strong
and
hardest
drive
of
t
j
watson
s
child
it
would
be
a
toss
up
between
jane
and
me
she
be
a
handsome
woman
tall
and
dark
haired
and
she
d
already
make
a
name
for
herself
in
washington
and
new
york
social
circle
she
have
dad
s
ability
to
get
to
know
and
charm
the
top
people
but
it
be
go
to
take
another
twenty
year
before
she
and
i
learn
to
get
along
dad
s
feeling
for
jane
be
complicate
i
could
never
see
what
he
want
for
her
and
maybe
he
didn
t
know
himself
it
probably
never
cross
his
mind
that
she
might
have
a
career
even
though
woman
executive
be
not
unheard
of
at
that
point
and
ibm
actually
have
a
woman
vice
president
in
charge
of
our
field
force
for
system
service
but
dad
didn
t
seem
to
want
jane
to
get
married
either
she
stayed
single
until
she
be
thirty
three
year
old
and
to
me
it
seem
as
if
she
d
come
close
to
wreck
her
life
for
dad
she
d
have
several
suitor
but
he
d
driven
them
away
it
wasn
t
until
after
the
war
that
jane
found
an
acceptable
man
his
name
be
john
irwin
ii
and
he
be
tall
attractive
and
probably
the
best
dancer
i
ever
saw
jack
never
drank
never
smoke
but
boy
could
he
dance
he
d
be
president
of
his
class
at
princeton
all
four
year
and
captain
of
the
track
team
his
war
record
be
outstanding
too
he
serve
on
general
macarthur
s
staff
rise
very
rapidly
and
be
discharge
a
full
colonel
one
rank
high
than
mine
he
be
start
a
promising
career
as
a
lawyer
and
diplomat
once
jane
get
married
i
have
hope
that
we
might
become
tolerant
of
one
another
she
and
jack
and
olive
and
i
have
some
good
time
skiing
together
in
vermont
and
go
to
margaret
truman
s
party
at
the
white
house
but
any
success
i
have
at
ibm
seem
to
burn
jane
up
i
finally
saw
just
how
competitive
she
felt
toward
me
during
a
visit
to
her
house
in
the
spring
of
there
be
picture
and
trophy
of
jack
everywhere
jack
as
an
oarsman
jack
as
a
track
star
jack
as
this
jack
as
that
jane
knew
i
be
a
little
envious
of
jack
because
every
opportunity
i
have
miss
in
my
youth
he
have
hit
on
the
head
she
saw
me
look
at
memento
of
his
war
career
and
say
tom
do
you
know
that
jack
be
a
full
colonel
she
be
needle
me
because
i
hadn
t
make
it
to
that
grade
i
completely
lose
my
temper
yeah
of
course
i
know
he
be
a
full
colonel
but
i
be
the
one
fly
airplane
all
over
the
world
there
be
always
certain
thing
dad
could
say
that
would
tick
me
off
in
ten
second
after
this
episode
tell
me
to
be
nice
to
jane
be
one
of
them
and
hold
jack
up
as
an
example
be
another
jack
and
i
get
along
fine
but
dad
be
never
convince
i
meant
him
well
he
d
say
i
don
t
know
why
you
object
to
your
brother
in
law
he
be
a
very
thoughtful
fellow
he
think
very
carefully
before
he
speaks
his
implication
be
clear
jack
have
the
discipline
and
self
control
that
i
lack
i
d
rise
to
the
bait
every
time
there
be
time
in
those
early
year
when
dad
and
i
really
get
along
generally
when
he
relaxed
his
grip
enough
to
let
me
run
part
of
ibm
as
i
knew
i
could
as
executive
vice
president
i
be
now
ibm
s
number
two
man
practically
speak
even
though
dad
have
arrange
thing
perhaps
wisely
to
keep
george
phillips
as
a
buffer
between
us
he
do
this
by
shuffle
title
promote
phillips
to
president
and
kick
himself
upstairs
to
the
new
position
of
chairman
in
my
new
job
i
be
responsible
for
a
great
deal
more
than
our
sale
operation
i
be
suppose
to
oversee
all
of
ibm
s
manufacturing
which
meant
that
i
have
to
find
a
way
quickly
to
become
somebody
in
the
eye
of
more
than
nine
thousand
factory
worker
they
be
tremendously
loyal
to
dad
they
d
be
loyal
to
kirk
but
they
barely
knew
me
dad
saw
that
this
could
be
a
problem
and
six
month
after
i
get
promote
he
call
me
to
his
office
and
hand
me
an
envelope
here
s
your
opportunity
to
endear
yourself
to
the
factory
people
he
say
why
don
t
you
talk
to
them
it
be
an
anonymous
letter
complain
about
the
work
condition
in
one
of
our
plant
it
say
we
have
fifty
people
work
in
a
building
that
be
design
to
be
a
warehouse
it
isn
t
properly
heat
and
there
s
only
one
toilet
it
be
a
disgrace
to
have
ibm
people
work
this
way
i
left
the
next
day
and
when
i
reach
the
factory
i
found
that
condition
be
exactly
as
described
somebody
have
decide
may
be
a
warm
enough
month
for
the
furnace
to
be
overhaul
they
d
torn
it
to
piece
and
then
a
cold
snap
hit
so
everybody
be
miserable
i
do
what
i
thought
dad
would
have
do
i
get
temporary
heater
put
in
within
ninety
minute
of
my
arrival
within
two
hour
i
have
men
cut
foundation
for
new
toilet
in
the
back
then
i
call
all
the
worker
together
i
take
a
stepladder
and
climbed
up
on
it
and
say
i
want
to
read
you
this
letter
unhappily
it
s
unsigned
because
i
would
like
to
give
a
raise
and
a
promotion
to
the
man
who
write
it
i
wish
he
d
have
enough
confidence
in
me
to
sign
his
name
but
he
s
absolutely
right
those
men
with
jackhammer
be
put
in
eight
more
toilet
and
we
re
go
to
permanently
improve
the
building
s
heat
it
be
a
happy
way
for
me
to
begin
my
duty
in
manufacturing
and
word
of
what
i
d
do
spread
through
all
our
plant
dad
be
pleased
when
i
get
back
to
new
york
and
told
him
of
my
performance
on
the
stepladder
it
show
i
be
learn
what
may
have
pleased
him
even
more
be
that
ibm
be
begin
to
make
money
from
some
of
my
earlier
decision
for
example
thanks
to
a
personnel
change
i
d
make
the
year
after
charley
kirk
die
our
typewriter
division
be
about
to
earn
its
first
profit
ever
since
dad
have
bought
the
electro
matic
typewriter
company
in
we
d
be
try
to
sell
american
business
on
the
virtue
of
electric
typewriter
dad
thought
they
be
a
sure
bet
because
they
be
fast
and
neat
and
enable
the
woman
in
the
office
to
type
without
knock
their
manicure
to
piece
but
the
machine
be
several
time
more
expensive
than
ordinary
typewriter
and
after
the
war
they
still
hadn
t
caught
on
our
annual
typewriter
sale
be
only
eleven
million
dollar
and
we
d
lose
money
in
the
business
every
year
so
in
early
i
told
norman
collister
the
division
chief
i
d
rather
sell
this
operation
outright
than
keep
bleeding
forever
i
be
sharp
with
him
but
he
come
back
at
me
just
as
strongly
we
re
still
get
our
foot
under
us
it
s
pretty
hard
for
me
to
convince
myself
of
that
because
we
ve
be
at
it
for
thirteen
year
i
say
we
have
a
big
distribution
system
a
train
sale
force
and
there
s
be
no
lack
of
money
for
development
if
we
be
go
to
make
it
we
should
have
make
it
by
now
i
can
t
really
talk
to
you
about
this
tom
he
say
you
just
don
t
understand
the
typewriter
business
that
be
as
good
as
tell
me
that
we
have
to
accept
lose
money
all
the
time
so
i
go
to
dad
and
say
you
can
t
go
on
with
that
guy
the
only
way
he
can
run
the
business
be
in
the
red
let
s
get
somebody
else
in
i
have
in
mind
h
wisner
miller
a
man
i
have
know
since
before
the
war
wiz
be
a
few
year
old
than
i
and
i
admire
him
because
he
d
have
to
fight
real
adversity
he
come
from
a
prominent
family
and
he
d
be
a
princeton
freshman
in
when
the
stock
market
crashed
his
father
lose
everything
and
wiz
have
to
quit
school
the
only
job
he
could
find
at
first
be
sell
vacuum
cleaner
door
to
door
in
the
bronx
one
of
ibm
s
director
knew
him
and
introduce
him
to
dad
who
hire
him
to
sell
typewriter
because
he
like
miller
s
spirit
choose
wiz
to
run
the
typewriter
division
have
be
a
big
gamble
dad
go
along
with
me
even
though
it
meant
jumping
miller
from
a
fairly
low
position
over
men
dad
knew
a
lot
well
but
wiz
have
exactly
the
sale
approach
necessary
to
sell
those
machine
the
ibm
method
for
sell
punch
card
system
be
much
too
analytical
for
electric
typewriter
you
couldn
t
overcomplicate
it
what
wiz
brought
be
zip
and
enthusiasm
and
leadership
i
love
to
watch
him
inspire
his
men
at
sale
convention
he
d
have
a
typewriter
onstage
under
a
spotlight
all
by
itself
wiz
would
walk
up
in
his
blue
serge
suit
look
at
it
and
extend
a
finger
to
flick
away
an
imaginary
speck
of
dust
then
he
d
step
back
and
say
a
magnificent
machine
i
hate
to
see
even
a
speck
of
dust
on
that
machine
it
s
so
beautiful
he
taught
his
salesman
to
use
this
blarney
on
the
secretary
and
start
make
the
typewriter
in
different
color
like
red
and
tan
he
even
make
a
white
typewriter
that
my
father
present
to
pope
pius
xii
a
lot
of
system
men
call
miller
corny
and
simplistic
but
he
be
one
of
ibm
s
great
sale
leader
in
the
machine
caught
on
and
for
year
after
that
the
division
grow
at
a
percent
annual
rate
my
first
important
personnel
move
have
be
a
great
success
the
newspaper
in
the
late
s
be
full
of
talk
about
laboratory
computer
with
funny
name
like
binac
seac
maniac
and
johnniac
scientific
conference
on
compute
and
electronics
be
jammed
ibm
have
no
plan
to
build
such
machine
but
we
kept
hearing
of
project
at
american
and
english
university
big
name
company
like
raytheon
and
rca
and
some
tiny
startup
whose
name
nobody
recognize
all
of
the
new
machine
be
cumbersome
and
enormously
expensive
none
be
intend
to
be
sell
commercially
and
for
quite
a
while
the
eniac
the
celebrate
university
of
pennsylvania
machine
that
charley
kirk
and
i
go
to
see
be
the
only
computer
that
actually
work
but
this
didn
t
stop
people
from
speculate
what
the
giant
electronic
brain
be
go
to
mean
for
mankind
of
course
calculate
device
have
be
around
since
even
before
the
chinese
abacus
be
invent
and
there
be
a
few
giant
calculator
such
as
the
mark
i
machine
ibm
built
for
harvard
during
the
war
that
could
do
a
wide
variety
of
mathematical
job
but
they
do
it
in
essence
by
counting
on
their
finger
their
inner
working
be
electromechanical
like
those
of
an
ordinary
tabulate
machine
when
eniac
be
unveiled
it
create
a
huge
stir
because
it
be
fundamentally
different
it
have
no
move
part
except
for
the
electron
fly
at
close
to
the
speed
of
light
inside
its
vacuum
tube
all
these
circuit
really
do
be
add
one
and
one
but
that
s
all
they
need
to
do
the
most
complicate
problem
of
science
and
business
often
break
down
into
simple
step
of
arithmetic
and
logic
such
as
add
subtract
compare
and
make
list
but
to
amount
to
anything
these
step
have
to
be
repeat
million
of
time
and
until
the
computer
no
machine
be
fast
enough
the
quick
relay
mechanism
in
our
punch
card
machine
could
only
do
four
addition
per
second
even
the
primitive
electronic
circuit
of
the
eniac
could
do
five
thousand
this
boost
in
speed
promise
to
change
the
life
of
everyone
who
work
with
number
i
heard
one
engineer
compare
it
to
the
difference
between
have
one
dollar
and
one
million
dollar
a
time
magazine
writer
who
be
at
eniac
s
debut
write
that
its
nimble
electron
open
a
whole
new
frontier
until
then
there
be
know
principle
in
science
and
engineering
that
no
one
use
because
they
require
too
much
figure
aircraft
designer
for
example
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
predict
wind
resistance
theoretically
but
it
be
so
much
trouble
to
do
the
calculation
that
they
use
the
hit
or
miss
method
of
make
scale
model
and
test
them
in
expensive
wind
tunnel
instead
so
when
eniac
appear
people
have
vision
of
computer
help
to
break
the
sound
barrier
predict
the
weather
unlock
the
secret
of
genetics
and
design
weapon
even
more
terrify
than
the
a
bomb
my
father
initially
thought
the
electronic
computer
would
have
no
impact
on
the
way
ibm
do
business
because
to
him
punch
card
machine
and
giant
computer
belong
in
totally
separate
realm
a
computer
revolution
might
sweep
across
the
scientific
world
but
in
the
accounting
room
the
punch
card
be
go
to
stay
on
top
dad
be
like
the
king
who
see
a
revolution
go
on
in
the
country
next
door
to
his
own
yet
be
astound
when
his
own
subject
get
restless
he
didn
t
realize
that
an
old
era
have
end
and
a
new
era
have
begin
ibm
be
in
the
classic
position
of
the
company
that
get
tunnel
vision
because
of
its
success
in
that
same
period
the
movie
industry
be
about
to
miss
out
on
television
because
it
thought
it
be
the
movie
industry
instead
of
the
entertainment
industry
the
railroad
industry
be
about
to
miss
out
on
trucking
and
air
freight
because
it
thought
it
be
in
train
instead
of
transportation
our
business
be
data
processing
and
not
just
punch
card
but
nobody
at
ibm
be
smart
enough
to
figure
that
out
yet
i
don
t
mean
to
say
that
dad
totally
ignore
the
challenge
that
computer
pose
he
believe
that
no
one
could
beat
ibm
when
it
come
to
building
giant
calculator
for
science
which
be
all
he
thought
the
new
computer
be
and
he
set
out
to
prove
it
in
the
spring
of
when
i
be
still
only
a
vice
president
and
spending
most
of
my
time
oversee
the
sale
force
he
call
in
the
engineer
who
have
work
on
the
mark
i
machine
for
harvard
dad
told
them
he
want
a
new
super
calculator
that
would
be
the
best
fast
big
well
than
the
harvard
machine
certainly
well
than
eniac
they
could
use
vacuum
tube
if
that
would
make
the
machine
work
well
but
he
want
it
finish
in
eight
month
dad
have
his
engineer
pretty
intimidate
and
they
didn
t
dare
ask
for
more
time
instead
they
go
flat
out
they
put
all
their
other
project
aside
work
virtually
around
the
clock
for
the
rest
of
spent
almost
a
million
dollar
and
built
a
machine
that
work
it
be
call
the
selective
sequence
electronic
calculator
or
ssec
and
it
be
a
weird
gigantic
hybrid
of
electronic
and
mechanical
part
half
modern
computer
and
half
punch
card
machine
in
be
foot
long
with
tube
and
mechanical
relay
it
could
do
the
equivalent
of
ten
year
of
paper
and
pencil
work
in
an
hour
in
some
way
the
machine
be
extremely
innovative
it
earn
a
spot
in
computer
industry
history
as
the
first
big
calculator
ever
to
run
on
software
this
make
it
much
more
practical
than
the
eniac
you
could
switch
the
ssec
to
a
new
problem
just
by
feed
instruction
into
its
memory
whereas
program
the
eniac
involve
manually
reset
hundred
of
switch
on
its
console
yet
because
of
its
mechanical
innards
the
ssec
be
a
technological
dinosaur
it
be
inherently
slow
than
the
all
electronic
eniac
and
speed
be
the
thing
user
crave
try
to
make
sure
the
ssec
would
get
as
much
public
attention
as
the
eniac
dad
have
it
instal
in
our
showroom
on
the
ground
floor
of
ibm
headquarters
in
manhattan
in
full
view
of
the
sidewalk
passersby
on
fifty
seventh
street
could
look
in
the
window
and
watch
the

it
be

computer
when
hollywood
start
to
put

movie
they
look
just
like
the
ssec
even
though
it
didn
t
exactly
qualify
as
a
computer
dad
dedicate
the
machine
to
the
use
of
science
throughout
the
world
and
ran
it
on
a
nonprofit
basis
anybody
with
a
problem
of
pure
science
could
use
it
for

for
anybody
else
such
as
an

set
him
up
with
a

lab
next

his

give
many
scientist
their

and
brought
large
number
of
people
to
the

dad
really
thought
that
the
ssec
be
the

to
end
all

and
in
a
way
that
be
true
it
be
like
a
vintage
car
i
once
own
the
stanley
steamer
quite
remarkably
advanced
for
what
it
be
but
not
the
technology
to
carry
the
day
the
ssec
marked
the
end
of
an
era
at
ibm
it
be
the
last
great
achievement
of
a
talented
group
of
inventor
who
have
spent
their
life
work
for

they
d
design
the
punch
card
machine
on
which
ibm
built
its
success
and
now
they
d
produce
one
of
the
most
advanced
machine
ever
but
even
though
they
reach
the
threshold
of
the
computer
age
few
of
them
step
across
the
ssec
be
built
in
splendid
isolation
its
design
be
kept
secret
so
that
in
spite
of
its
success
it
do
little
to
change

to
think
of
us
as
a
stodgy
company
that
be
wed
to
punch
card
and
the
past
my
father
be
highly
skeptical
when
eniac
s
inventor
eckert
and
mauchly
quit
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
go
into
competition
with
ibm
set
up
their
own
company
in
a
philadelphia
storefront
but
before
long
it
be
clear
that
they
be
good
salesman
as
well
as
brilliant
engineer
they
name
their
new
machine
the
universal
automatic
computer
or
univac
and
claimed
it
be
go
to
be
useful
in
both
the
laboratory
and
the
accounting
office
the
first
univac
wasn
t
due
to
be
ready
for
year
but
with
nothing
more
than
a
paper
description
eckert
and
mauchly
won
financial
backing
from
two
of
our
ten
big
customer
the
census
bureau
and
prudential
insurance
and
at
least
one
other
insurer
besides
when
dad
found
out
about
that
his
skepticism
turn
into
fury
on
the
wednesday
before
labor
day
of
i
walk
into
his
office
to
find
him
rip
up
frank
hamilton
one
of
our
senior
engineer
there
be
a
secretary
present
who
take
down
the
scene
verbatim
father
start
in
by
say
now
i
understand
these
fellow
who
built
the
eniac
machine
be
be
back
by
insurance
company
to
build
something
for
them
why
don
t
we
build
a
machine
to
meet
their
specification
i
think
we
intend
to
do
something
on
that
hamilton
say
he
be
act
a
little
sullen
because
my
father
be
forget
that
he
and
the
other
engineer
have
be
work
day
and
night
try
to
get
the
supercalculator
built
meanwhile
dad
be
get
madder
and
madder
we
can
t
think
and
intend
when
insurance
company
be
backing
this
outfit
to
build
machine
we
can
t
afford
just
to
think
about
and
intend
to
this
business
wasn
t
built
that
way
what
be
the
quick
way
to
go
ahead
and
build
a
machine
to
meet
their
specification
in
the
very
shortest
possible
time
the
best
plan
be
to
survey
the
spec
and
see
what
they
want
we
know
their
specification
and
we
have
already
lose
three
month
on
it
if
we
can
t
build
it
let
s
drop
out
if
we
can
do
it
let
s
do
it
at
a
price
those
other
fellow
can
t
meet
if
we
can
t
build
a
machine
and
give
it
to
them
on
a
well
basis
than
anybody
else
then
we
be
not
entitle
to
the
business
it
s
an
indictment
against
ibm
to
have
these
two
fellow
back
by
those
insurance
company
hamilton
finally
realize
how
angry
dad
be
he
start
yessing
to
save
his
life
there
be
no
question
that
we
can
do
it
he
say
not
a
bit
of
doubt
about
it
i
knew
what
be
upset
dad
the
most
about
the
univac
design
he
felt
it
be
an
insult
to
our
main
sell
proposition
the
ibm
card
itself
eckert
and
mauchly
be
say
that
punch
card
be
not
appropriate
for
use
with
modern
electronic
equipment
instead
the
univac
be
go
to
store
data
on
the
new
medium
of
magnetic
tape
the
same
stuff
be
use
in
the
early
tape
recorder
of
the
day
this
method
be
still
largely
unproven
but
it
be
call
for
in
almost
all
the
new
computer
design
eckert
and
mauchly
explain
to
customer
that
magnetic
tape
have
big
advantage
over
punch
card
first
it
be
fast
it
could
pump
data
into
and
out
of
a
large
scale
computer
at
a
rate
more
closely
match
to
the
speed
of
the
electronic
circuit
second
it
be
compact
a
single
reel
the
size
of
a
dinner
plate
could
hold
the
policy
record
of
an
entire
insurance
district
which
normally
require
around
ten
thousand
punch
card
stretch
several
yard
i
doubt
that
frank
hamilton
have
much
time
off
that
labor
day
the
follow
tuesday
he
appear
look
haggard
at
a
meeting
convene
by
dad
in
the
big
walnut
panel
boardroom
next
to
his
office
all
of
ibm
s
officer
be
there
along
with
the
company
expert
on
insurance
industry
accounting
hamilton
present
an
ambitious
plan
for
a
machine
to
go
up
against
univac
it
would
use
tape
in
combination
with
punch
card
and
would
cost
to
build
people
gasped
from
a
punch
card
standpoint
this
be
a
stagger
amount
our
average
installation
in
those
day
cost
about
to
manufacture
and
rent
for
about
a
month
by
that
yardstick
the
rent
on
a
computer
would
have
to
be
a
month
dad
compliment
hamilton
on
his
hard
work
and
then
picked
the
plan
to
piece
it
be
obvious
that
he
didn
t
like
hamilton
s
machine
because
it
resemble
the
univac
have
built
his
career
on
punch
card
dad
distrust
magnetic
tape
instinctively
on
a
punch
card
you
have
a
piece
of
information
that
be
permanent
you
could
see
it
and
hold
it
in
your
hand
even
the
enormous
file
the
insurance
company
kept
could
always
be
sample
and
hand
checked
by
clerk
but
with
magnetic
tape
your
data
be
store
invisibly
on
a
medium
that
be
design
to
be
erase
and
reuse
imagine
himself
in
the
customer
s
shoe
dad
say
why
you
might
be
go
ahead
and
think
you
be
store
information
on
that
magnetic
tape
and
when
you
try
to
get
it
off
you
might
find
you
have
nothing
there
frank
hamilton
s
design
die
on
the
table
while
dad
told
the
marketing
men
to
call
on
prudential
and
persuade
them
that
the
univac
idea
be
not
sound
at
that
point
i
wasn
t
sure
that
building
computer
like
the
univac
or
abandon
punch
card
for
magnetic
tape
would
ever
make
business
sense
the
new
computer
be
clumsy
extremely
expensive
and
involve
so
much
exotic
and
unproven
technology
that
there
be
a
real
chance
they
might
never
be
dependable
enough
for
business
use
i
share
many
of
dad
s
misgiving
but
i
be
compel
by
the
tremendous
speed
of
electronic
circuit
customer
be
snap
up
our
little
electronic
multiplier
which
dad
have
put
on
the
market
at
my
urge
compare
with
the
univac
it
be
a
tiny
mouse
of
a
machine
design
to
fit
in
with
ordinary
punch
card
equipment
and
rent
for
only
a
month
but
it
be
a
success
my
first
at
ibm
and
i
thought
it
might
be
a
sign
of
thing
to
come
we
have
a
small
team
of
electronics
engineer
in
poughkeepsie
work
on
an
improve
version
call
the
but
i
start
get
concerned
that
we
might
not
be
do
enough
i
suppose
on
some
level
i
be
think
that
i
be
only
thirty
three
year
old
and
that
a
decade
or
two
down
the
road
ibm
might
run
out
of
string
in
i
get
even
more
nervous
my
friend
red
lamotte
sent
up
a
letter
from
the
washington
office
say
he
d
assign
a
man
to
attend
engineering
conference
around
the
country
by
that
man
s
count
there
be
no
few
than
nineteen
significant
computer
project
underway
most
of
them
involve
magnetic
tape
red
say
this
make
him
wonder
inasmuch
as
ibm
be
the
leader
in
the
field
of
calculate
equipment
do
it
not
seem
reasonable
that
it
too
should
be
kept
abreast
of
all
development
by
active
participation
in
this
field
i
start
get
warning
from
customer
as
well
that
the
punch
card
be
head
out
the
window
jim
madden
a
vice
president
of
metropolitan
life
and
a
friend
of
dad
s
invite
me
downtown
to
his
office
tom
he
say
you
re
go
to
lose
your
business
with
us
because
we
already
have
three
floor
of
this
building
fill
with
punch
card
and
it
s
get
bad
we
just
can
t
afford
to
pay
for
that
kind
of
storage
space
and
i
m
told
we
can
put
our
record
on
magnetic
tape
roy
larsen
the
president
of
time
inc
say
much
the
same
thing
i
be
work
for
him
in
the
new
york
hospital
fund
drive
and
his
company
be
one
of
our
big
account
he
explain
that
the
success
of
time
and
life
magazine
depend
on
their
get
to
million
of
reader
each
week
while
the
news
be
still
hot
time
inc
be
use
ibm
equipment
to
handle
the
mail
list
and
address
label
but
each
subscription
require
three
punch
card
and
with
the
list
grow
by
thousand
of
new
subscriber
each
month
the
machine
be
barely
keep
up
we
have
a
whole
building
full
of
your
gear
larsen
told
me
we
re
swamp
if
you
can
t
promise
us
something
new
we
re
go
to
have
to
start
move
some
other
way
i
didn
t
think
it
would
be
prudent
to
run
to
dad
with
the
idea
that
punch
card
be
die
he
d
have
thrown
me
out
of
his
office
instead
i
use
a
systematic
approach
that
i
knew
would
make
sense
to
the
old
man
in
i
organize
a
task
force
of
eighteen
of
our
best
system
expert
to
study
whether
we
should
add
magnetic
tape
to
our
product
line
with
dad
it
be
almost
a
religion
that
idea
for
improve
the
product
line
should
come
from
customer
of
course
customer
weren
t
always
ask
for
the
same
thing
some
want
the
machine
to
be
faster
some
want
them
to
print
more
neatly
and
handle
more
carbon
copy
some
want
them
to
be
less
noisy
and
if
you
panicked
and
do
everything
they
suggest
you
d
go
broke
you
need
to
sort
out
what
improvement
make
sense
and
would
really
pay
the
task
force
study
the
magnetic
tape
issue
for
three
month
when
they
come
back
their
answer
be
that
punch
card
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
accounting
job
and
that
magnetic
tape
have
no
place
in
ibm
i
try
again
bring
in
top
salesman
and
describe
what
magnetic
tape
could
do
but
they
all
end
up
say
no
it
s
well
to
use
punch
card
they
give
me
nothing
i
could
take
to
dad
i
be
begin
to
learn
that
the
majority
even
the
majority
of
top
performer
be
never
the
one
to
ask
when
you
need
to
make
a
move
you
ve
get
to
feel
what
s
go
on
in
the
world
and
then
make
the
move
yourself
it
s
purely
visceral
i
didn
t
trust
myself
enough
yet
to
insist
but
i
knew
in
my
gut
that
we
have
to
get
into
computer
and
magnetic
tape
to
my
great
surprise
this
be
echoed
by
one
man
at
headquarters
who
kept
prod
me
to
act
kirk
s
old
crony
birkenstock
talk
him
out
of
quit
after
kirk
die
be
one
of
the
best
move
i
ever
make
because
birkenstock
do
more
to
put
ibm
into
the
computer
business
than
any
other
man
after
his
demotion
from
general
sale
manager
he
d
be
sideline
in
a
little
department
call
future
demand
its
job
be
to
help
fine
tune
the
product
line
by
keep
track
of
customer
request
it
take
birkenstock
only
a
few
month
to
transform
future
demand
into
a
watchdog
of
ibm
s
future
he
be
no
engineer
himself
but
he
have
a
natural
understand
of
technical
matter
and
an
ability
to
articulate
them
birkenstock
be
constantly
tell
me
that
the
punch
card
be
doom
and
so
be
we
unless
we
woke
up
customer
want
more
speed
and
we
be
reach
the
limit
of
how
fast
our
machine
could
go
when
we
make
our
punch
punch
faster
they
wore
out
quicker
when
we
push
our
high
speed
sorter
up
from
six
hundred
card
a
minute
to
eight
hundred
the
card
themselves
start
get
ripped
to
shred
he
be
constantly
goad
me
call
my
attention
to
all
the
activity
in
electronics
and
ask
if
i
really
want
to
miss
out
this
be
nerve
wrack
to
listen
to
all
the
time
because
i
didn
t
know
how
i
d
convince
my
father
but
i
knew
i
d
be
a
fool
to
close
my
ear
not
long
afterward
i
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
smart
way
to
protect
our
future
would
be
to
hire
electronics
engineer
large
number
of
electronics
engineer
whether
we
end
up
try
to
commercialize
computer
and
magnetic
tape
or
not
ibm
need
to
understand
what
be
go
on
the
field
of
electronics
be
advance
so
fast
on
so
many
front
that
i
thought
a
small
group
would
never
keep
up
we
need
a
critical
mass
but
this
be
before
dad
make
me
executive
vice
president
and
nobody
in
his
research
and
development
operation
would
listen
to
me
ibm
s
main
laboratory
on
north
street
in
endicott
be
a
very
peculiar
place
between
three
hundred
and
four
hundred
people
work
there
but
the
whole
thing
be
built
around
seven
senior
engineer
whom
dad
call
his
inventor
they
be
mostly
self
taught
and
they
d
be
with
t
j
for
decade
even
though
there
be
a
laboratory
manager
and
a
vice
president
of
engineering
these
inventor
report
directly
to
dad
he
be
really
the
chief
engineer
when
he
have
an
idea
for
a
product
he
d
call
in
one
or
two
of
these
old
bird
and
describe
what
he
want
it
to
do
then
the
inventor
would
go
back
and
try
to
put
it
in
metal
as
they
use
to
say
each
one
have
his
own
workshop
and
assistant
and
dad
like
to
make
two
or
more
of
these
team
compete
when
he
have
a
technical
problem
that
absolutely
have
to
be
solve
nobody
be
smart
enough
to
determine
such
thing
in
advance
he
use
to
tell
me
it
be
an
expensive
but
very
effective
way
to
develop
product
and
later
on
i
use
it
myself
unfortunately
none
of
dad
s
inventor
understood
electronics
the
man
who
design
the
ssec
for
example
didn
t
know
how
to
hook
up
vacuum
tube
and
he
literally
have
to
go
out
and
hire
young
engineer
two
and
three
year
out
of
school
to
do
the
job
the
inventor
have
be
so
successful
for
so
long
that
they
be
set
in
their
way
and
they
pooh
poohed
my
concern
about
our
lack
of
electronics
expertise
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
engineering
become
a
real
thorn
in
my
side
he
be
a
princeton
graduate
with
a
degree
in
electrical
engineering
who
have
be
with
us
since
he
be
extremely
creative
in
his
way
and
have
be
a
great
success
at
promote
the
use
of
ibm
equipment
in
the
world
of
scientific
computation
it
turn
out
that
punch
card
machine
be
useful
on
small
scientific
problem
and
one
of
our
punch
card
machine
be
so
popular
among
scientist
that
it
be
call
the
poor
man
s
eniac
the
trouble
with
this
vice
president
be
that
he
be
more
engineer
than
executive
although
he
be
interested
in
electronics
he
never
really
understood
that
pursue
it
adequately
would
require
a
fundamental
change
in
direction
for
ibm
the
only
electronics
expert
we
have
on
staff
work
far
outside
the
company
mainstream
their
lab
be
in
poughkeepsie
in
an
old
country
mansion
overlook
the
hudson
and
they
have
to
share
it
with
engineer
from
our
typewriter
plant
nearby
most
of
the
electronics
men
have
wartime
experience
on
thing
like
radar
their
bos
ralph
palmer
have
work
on
top
secret
electronic
circuit
project
for
what
later
become
the
national
security
agency
in
and
the
main
project
at
poughkeepsie
be
improve
my
pet
machine
the
the
group
have
also
start
to
experiment
with
univac
style
compute
and
magnetic
tape
but
when
palmer
ask
for
manpower
and
funding
to
expand
this
effort
the
vice
president
of
engineering
told
him
no
he
thought
such
work
would
merely
soak
up
resource
that
the
main
lab
in
endicott
could
use
for
improve
our
punch
card
line
the
boy
at
endicott
have
high
hope
for
a
number
of
project
they
have
a
new
line
of
machine
in
the
work
that
could
use
giant
punch
card
these
be
twice
the
size
of
ordinary
card
could
hold
much
more
information
and
be
be
count
on
to
help
keep
customer
like
time
inc
loyal
ibm
have
so
much
built
in
resistance
to
explore
electronic
compute
that
we
might
have
be
well
off
simply
buying
out
eckert
and
mauchly
ironically
we
be
offer
the
chance
to
do
just
that
in
their
principal
backer
get
kill
in
a
plane
crash
and
before
long
the
two
inventor
ran
out
of
money
and
come
to
dad
i
be
in
his
office
for
their
visit
i
be
curious
about
mauchly
whom
i
d
never
met
he
turn
out
to
be
a
lanky
character
who
dress
sloppily
and
like
to
flout
convention
eckert
by
contrast
be
very
neat
when
they
come
in
mauchly
slump
down
on
the
couch
and
put
his
foot
up
on
the
coffee
table
damn
if
he
be
go
to
show
any
respect
for
my
father
eckert
start
describe
what
they
d
accomplish
but
dad
have
already
guess
the
reason
for
their
visit
and
our
lawyer
have
told
him
that
buying
their
company
be
out
of
the
question
univac
be
one
of
the
few
competitor
we
have
and
antitrust
law
say
we
couldn
t
take
them
over
so
dad
told
eckert
i
shouldn
t
allow
you
to
go
on
too
far
we
cannot
make
any
kind
of
arrangement
with
you
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
let
you
think
we
could
legally
we
ve
be
told
we
can
t
do
it
eckert
understood
perfectly
he
leap
to
his
foot
and
say
all
the
same
thanks
very
much
for
your
time
mauchly
never
say
a
word
he
slouch
out
the
door
after
an
erect
eckert
a
couple
of
month
later
come
an
announcement
that
they
d
be
bought
out
by
jim
rand
remington
rand
our
old
rival
in
punch
card
be
now
get
ready
to
fill
order
for
six
univacs
it
be
the
success
of
the
electronic
calculator
that
convince
me
that
electronics
be
go
to
grow
much
faster
than
anyone
have
anticipate
like
its
predecessor
the
this
machine
be
design
to
fit
into
an
ordinary
punch
card
installation
right
down
to
its
clumsy
victorian
look
black
metal
case
but
there
be
nothing
old
fashion
underneath
that
shell
palmer
and
his
men
have
produce
an
amazingly
elegant
design
that
make
it
easy
to
cope
with
vacuum
tube
which
be
constantly
burning
out
or
otherwise
go
haywire
they
mount
each
tube
and
its
support
circuit
in
a
standard
plug
in
unit
that
could
be
mass
produce
at
very
low
cost
that
way
every
tube
could
be
thoroughly
test
before
it
ever
go
into
a
machine
if
it
go
bad
while
the
machine
be
in
use
it
could
be
easily
replace
the
design
also
make
it
simple
for
us
to
increase
production
when
customer
start
snap
up
the
when
we
first
brought
it
out
in
mid
we
expect
to
sell
a
few
hundred
over
the
machine
s
lifetime
but
by
the
end
of
we
d
already
instal
almost
three
hundred
and
demand
clearly
be
go
into
the
thousand
the
rent
for
a
month
about
the
same
as
a
sophisticated
electromechanical
tabulator
but
it
could
handle
division
and
other
job
that
be
almost
prohibitively
expensive
to
do
mechanically
but
palmer
s
operation
be
an
anomaly
i
do
a
complete
review
of
all
our
development
project
once
i
become
executive
vice
president
in
and
decide
that
ibm
be
still
in
the
dark
age
i
finally
told
dad
we
need
something
different
by
then
i
be
terribly
frustrate
so
i
criticize
his
organization
in
endicott
in
the
roughest
possible
way
i
say
to
him
all
you
ve
get
up
there
be
a
bunch
of
monkey
wrench
engineer
don
t
you
see
the
time
for
hack
machine
out
of
metal
be
go
now
you
re
get
into
a
field
where
you
have
to
use
oscilloscope
and
understand
the
theory
of
electron
stream
and
scan
beam
inside
the
tube
you
ve
get
to
do
theoretical
thing
you
ve
get
to
do
them
with
able
people
with
different
background
from
the
people
we
now
have
you
ve
get
to
hire
engineering
graduate
a
lot
of
them
i
be
attack
a
source
of
the
old
man
s
pride
he
be
always
tell
people
that
ibm
have
the
great
engineering
department
in
the
world
and
that
he
put
all
his
faith
in
engineering
but
he
didn
t
answer
me
directly
instead
he
buzz
his
secretary
and
ask
for
the
vice
president
of
engineering
to
be
sent
down
he
come
about
two
minute
later
and
dad
say
to
him
my
son
tell
me
that
we
don
t
have
any
kind
of
research
organization
be
that
true
the
vice
president
thought
awhile
he
be
slow
in
the
way
he
give
his
answer
he
wasn
t
be
glib
he
say
we
have
the
fine
research
organization
in
the
world
that
be
the
end
of
him
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
all
businessmen
get
ask
a
question
like
that
sometime
in
their
life
they
either
answer
it
with
courage
and
get
fire
or
promote
or
they
answer
like
a
patsy
he
d
just
make
a
major
mistake
because
dad
wasn
t
go
to
live
very
long
and
i
be
never
go
to
want
the
vice
president
around
me
again
if
i
knew
we
lack
the
organization
we
need
he
should
have
know
it
too
he
knew
research
and
he
knew
engineering
and
he
ought
to
have
be
able
to
see
enough
of
the
future
to
understand
we
be
in
a
bad
spot
i
think
he
be
afraid
to
push
dad
very
hard
maybe
he
sense
that
dad
didn
t
want
him
to
but
there
be
a
lot
of
way
he
could
have
hedge
it
he
could
have
say
mr
watson
you
re
both
right
we
have
a
superior
engineering
department
for
what
we
ve
built
until
now
but
we
re
go
to
have
to
move
into
vacuum
tube
and
electronic
circuit
and
we
ve
get
almost
nobody
who
know
about
them
i
don
t
know
how
long
dad
and
i
would
have
stayed
at
an
impasse
on
engineering
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
al
williams
at
that
point
he
be
still
in
finance
and
he
do
a
study
compare
ibm
s
research
and
development
spending
with
that
of
rca
general
electric
and
other
successful
company
it
show
us
fall
behind
on
average
the
others
be
spending
three
percent
of
revenue
three
dollar
out
of
every
hundred
dollar
in
sale
flow
back
into
r
and
d
we
be
spending
about
two
dollar
and
a
quarter
williams
take
these
figure
to
dad
mr
watson
he
say
i
don
t
know
if
you
re
aware
of
it
or
not
but
we
be
slip
back
on
research
dad
be
totally
noncommittal
but
the
next
day
he
call
a
meeting
of
the
executive
and
say
now
gentleman
i
ve
be
think
about
our
effort
in
research
and
we
re
not
put
enough
into
that
i
want
you
to
go
out
and
build
this
up
now
mr
williams
mr
moneybag
over
there
may
complain
to
you
about
the
cost
but
don
t
let
him
stop
you
i
want
you
to
build
this
research
up
williams
have
act
without
my
knowledge
but
i
be
delighted
dad
knew
full
well
that
this
meant
a
major
expansion
in
electronics
i
look
across
the
room
at
the
vice
president
of
engineering
and
start
think
about
who
we
have
to
replace
him
palmer
wasn
t
the
right
choice
to
manage
the
expansion
put
the
leader
of
the
poughkeepsie
maverick
in
charge
would
be
an
unnecessary
insult
to
dad
s
inventor
in
endicott
besides
palmer
be
simply
too
important
in
the
lab
it
take
me
several
day
to
settle
on
my
choice
wally
mcdowell
the
head
of
the
endicott
lab
mcdowell
have
some
vague
connection
to
dad
because
his
father
be
a
doctor
in
the
town
of
corn
about
forty
mile
from
where
dad
grow
up
but
he
be
also
an
mit
graduate
one
of
the
few
we
have
at
that
stage
and
while
he
have
come
to
work
at
ibm
in
the
same
year
as
the
vice
president
of
engineering
and
have
the
respect
of
the
old
guard
he
struck
me
as
more
farsighted
even
though
he
have
no
experience
with
hire
electronics
engineer
i
thought
he
could
do
it
well
there
be
no
formal
procedure
for
get
mcdowell
promote
or
the
other
man
remove
i
just
wait
for
the
right
moment
to
ask
dad
it
come
in
may
when
we
be
in
endicott
for
the
hundred
percent
club
convention
there
be
a
company
field
day
and
dad
and
i
go
down
to
the
ibm
country
club
to
watch
the
sport
i
spot
mcdowell
near
the
tennis
court
and
say
to
my
father
we
ve
really
get
to
move
in
expand
our
research
program
dad
i
think
we
ought
to
start
with
wally
we
don
t
have
anybody
else
he
s
get
a
degree
from
mit
that
s
something
and
i
don
t
think
the
man
we
ve
get
in
the
job
have
the
energy
and
he
doesn
t
really
see
the
need
dad
have
apparently
thought
it
through
and
decide
for
himself
that
a
change
be
necessary
he
say
that
s
a
good
idea
why
don
t
you
go
over
and
talk
to
him
i
walk
around
the
tennis
court
get
hold
of
mcdowell
and
ask
him
if
he
d
move
down
to
new
york
and
hire
engineer
in
quantity
what
do
you
mean
by
quantity
he
say
a
few
dozen
i
could
do
that
from
up
here
no
i
mean
at
least
a
few
hundred
and
perhaps
a
few
thousand
wally
be
surprised
but
he
agree
and
we
make
him
director
of
engineering
his
predecessor
stayed
on
as
a
vice
president
ironically
have
the
burden
of
responsibility
take
away
seem
to
free
him
up
and
he
become
a
strong
and
effective
advocate
of
electronics
research
particularly
in
the
area
of
transistor
mcdowell
meanwhile
get
on
with
the
hire
it
wasn
t
easy
to
attract
top
electronics
people
at
first
because
we
didn
t
have
anything
in
place
we
couldn
t
say
come
see
what
we
have
our
pitch
be
more
like
come
hear
what
we
re
gonna
do
but
we
hire
plenty
because
i
told
mcdowell
to
take
any
man
who
have
even
a
reasonable
chance
of
be
good
i
didn
t
give
a
damn
where
they
come
from
so
he
gather
all
sort
in
his
net
american
and
european
and
egyptian
and
indian
some
of
the
one
from
very
different
culture
do
badly
we
have
a
high
percentage
of
success
with
the
british
and
american
but
until
we
have
a
critical
mass
that
didn
t
matter
the
problem
in
electronic
compute
be
so
diverse
and
so
vast
that
we
couldn
t
do
anything
without
enough
people
on
the
job
once
we
have
them
we
could
sort
them
out
thanks
to
mcdowell
s
effort
we
grow
from
five
hundred
engineer
and
technician
to
well
over
four
thousand
in
the
space
of
six
year
our
veteran
sale
executive
and
planner
watch
this
wave
of
immigration
with
extreme
skepticism
these
be
tough
marketing
men
the
core
of
ibm
and
with
punch
card
machine
sell
like
hotcake
it
make
no
sense
to
them
that
we
should
be
scramble
into
electronics
they
have
nickname
for
the
new
mit
type
we
be
bring
in
they
call
them
double
dome
and
long
hair
but
dad
let
us
do
our
thing
although
i
later
found
out
he
be
watch
very
closely
indeed
when
wally
mcdowell
first
move
down
to
new
york
a
messenger
would
show
up
at
his
desk
each
morning
at
with
two
box
lunch
at
dad
would
come
in
sit
down
unwrap
a
sandwich
and
start
ask
wally
question
i
never
knew
about
it
at
the
time
but
that
go
on
almost
every
day
for
month
we
finally
start
produce
computer
after
the
outbreak
of
the
korean
war
that
be
in
june
while
father
be
in
europe
busy
set
up
world
trade
he
cable
president
truman
put
the
resource
of
ibm
at
the
government
s
disposal
and
name
me
as
the
man
to
contact
i
assign
birkenstock
to
go
to
washington
and
find
out
what
we
could
do
i
knew
he
would
volunteer
ibm
to
build
a
computer
for
the
war
effort
and
i
thought
that
be
fine
it
seem
to
me
that
if
we
could
build
a
couple
of
one
of
a
kind
machine
under
government
contract
we
d
have
a
way
of
get
our
foot
wet
birkenstock
spent
the
fall
of
knock
on
door
at
the
pentagon
and
travel
around
visit
government
lab
and
defense
contractor
to
ask
about
their
compute
need
with
him
he
take
cuthbert
hurd
a
mathematician
who
have
join
us
in
from
the
atomic
energy
commission
s
laboratory
at
oak
ridge
hurd
knew
all
about
scientific
compute
in
fact
he
have
help
spearhead
the
drive
to
get
punch
card
machine
into
engineering
laboratory
and
workshop
they
look
into
a
lot
of
defense
related
field
atomic
energy
guide
missile
cryptanalysis
weather
forecasting
war
game
and
so
on
what
they
found
be
that
engineer
and
scientist
be
desperate
for
compute
power
there
be
a
terrible
sense
of
urgency
in
america
in
those
day
because
of
korea
only
five
year
have
go
by
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
but
we
have
thoroughly
demobilize
our
soldier
be
back
in
civilian
life
our
fleet
be
in
mothball
our
tank
and
bomber
have
be
scrap
when
korea
tie
up
the
only
stand
army
we
have
people
worried
that
russia
would
take
advantage
and
attack
in
europe
or
some
other
part
of
the
world
so
in
the
fall
of
there
be
a
frantic
rush
to
remobilize
and
rearm
as
birkenstock
and
hurd
travel
around
the
situation
in
korea
kept
get
bad
in
november
the
chinese
launch
a
bloody
attack
that
drove
our
army
out
of
north
korea
and
down
into
the
bottom
one
third
of
the
peninsula
in
the
context
of
those
grim
day
birkenstock
and
hurd
come
up
with
a
plan
much
bolder
than
i
expect
they
say
we
should
build
a
general
purpose
scientific
computer
to
work
in
all
the
defense
application
they
d
study
probably
it
won
t
solve
a
hundred
percent
of
anybody
s
problem
but
it
will
solve
ninety
percent
of
them
hurd
told
me
he
thought
we
could
find
customer
for
as
many
as
thirty
machine
this
idea
be
radical
on
two
count
it
be
radical
technically
because
all
told
there
be
probably
only
a
dozen
computer
in
existence
and
with
the
exception
of
eckert
and
mauchly
most
designer
be
still
think
in
term
of
one
of
a
kind
machine
and
it
be
radical
financially
because
birkenstock
and
hurd
want
us
to
pay
for
the
design
ourselves
birkenstock
point
out
that
if
we
accepted
taxpayer
money
we
d
have
to
turn
over
so
much
information
to
the
government
that
we
d
never
have
a
solid
patent
position
how
much
be
this
go
to
cost
i
say
for
the
design
and
a
prototype
three
million
dollar
he
say
for
the
whole
program
three
or
four
time
that
what
he
be
talk
about
be
by
far
the
most
expensive
project
in
ibm
history
ten
time
the
size
of
dad
s
ssec
i
ask
to
hear
more
about
the
machine
and
shortly
after
new
year
s
day
we
held
a
meeting
in
my
office
williams
and
i
be
the
only
nontechnical
men
there
hurd
palmer
and
birkenstock
put
their
briefcase
on
the
table
and
take
out
diagram
of
the
new
computer
a
confuse
bunch
of
black
box
connect
by
line
after
year
of
push
i
d
finally
come
to
the
moment
of
truth
we
have
the
money
and
i
knew
i
could
justify
the
project
to
dad
and
the
other
executive
simply
by
say
it
be
vital
to
the
war
effort
i
didn
t
want
to
ask
the
advice
of
our
sale
or
market
research
people
because
they
d
howl
the
minute
they
saw
what
we
want
to
do
and
it
be
not
a
decision
that
i
could
discus
in
any
detail
with
dad
i
only
have
a
rudimentary
understand
myself
and
would
never
be
able
to
answer
the
question
he
be
sure
to
raise
so
i
be
on
my
own
i
have
a
roomful
of
talented
technical
men
who
be
enthusiastic
and
want
to
try
but
it
be
a
three
million
dollar
gamble
a
sum
as
big
as
ibm
s
entire
research
budget
two
year
before
so
i
say
to
birkenstock
let
s
go
ahead
but
i
d
like
you
to
do
me
a
favor
take
these
plan
clean
them
up
and
you
and
hurd
go
out
and
see
whether
we
can
get
any
order
for
this
machine
meanwhile
to
ward
off
skeptic
from
the
sale
staff
we
give
our
new
computer
a
patriotic
name
the
defense
calculator
before
birkenstock
and
hurd
could
leave
on
their
sell
trip
we
have
to
decide
what
the
computer
be
go
to
cost
customer
nobody
at
ibm
knew
how
to
put
a
price
on
a
computer
so
palmer
and
his
men
figure
out
how
much
we
d
have
to
pay
for
the
vacuum
tube
boost
that
by
percent
and
come
out
with
a
rental
rate
of
eight
thousand
dollar
a
month
then
birkenstock
and
hurd
go
around
to
all
the
defense
laboratory
they
d
visit
before
and
make
a
sale
pitch
that
emphasize
the
new
thing
the
defense
calculator
would
make
possible
customer
jumped
at
the
idea
in
less
than
two
month
we
found
eleven
taker
for
the
defense
calculator
and
ten
more
prospective
one
with
order
in
hand
williams
and
i
present
the
project
to
dad
who
approve
it
without
a
single
question
many
people
have
the
impression
that
my
father
and
i
never
agree
on
the
subject
of
electronics
there
be
that
single
instance
when
he
call
the
vice
president
of
engineering
in
but
oddly
except
for
that
electronics
be
the
only
major
issue
on
which
we
didn
t
fight
i
like
to
think
that
if
i
hadn
t
be
around
to
push
dad
would
have
eventually
put
ibm
into
electronics
anyway
because
he
love
calculate
speed
before
the
defense
calculator
ever
come
up
dad
visit
a
laboratory
he
d
endow
at
columbia
university
where
researcher
be
experiment
with
high
speed
circuit
he
stop
off
at
my
office
when
he
come
back
and
i
could
see
how
excite
he
be
he
say
you
ought
to
go
up
there
and
see
that
i
don
t
know
what
it
be
but
the
fellow
be
do
it
two
hundred
thousand
time
a
second
but
as
thing
work
out
i
think
dad
decide
the
electronics
opportunity
should
be
mine
and
the
defense
calculator
be
the
first
big
risk
he
let
me
take
as
an
executive
once
the
project
get
under
way
the
idea
of
put
out
an
electronic
computer
capture
my
imagination
more
than
i
thought
business
ever
could
i
thought
of
the
defense
calculator
project
as
be
similar
to
what
the
wright
brother
have
do
they
want
to
fly
and
there
be
dozen
of
obstacle
that
stood
in
their
way
they
have
the
problem
of
power
and
the
problem
of
how
to
make
a
wing
that
would
lift
and
the
problem
of
how
to
control
the
wing
they
have
the
problem
of
how
to
take
off
they
have
to
build
efficient
propeller
and
when
they
try
to
model
them
on
boat
propeller
they
found
out
that
be
no
good
there
be
no
comparison
between
water
and
air
each
of
these
problem
be
a
discrete
and
different
issue
and
if
they
d
fail
at
any
of
them
they
d
never
have
flown
and
yet
those
two
men
along
with
one
assistant
from
their
bicycle
shop
solve
every
one
of
those
problem
in
the
space
of
about
seven
year
the
problem
we
face
be
just
as
complicate
though
we
have
hundred
more
men
and
much
more
money
to
work
with
we
be
move
away
from
the
punch
card
a
relatively
slow
medium
that
we
understood
very
well
to
something
a
hundred
time
faster
that
we
didn
t
understand
we
be

to

logic

in

be
do
in
the
original
house
we
be
essentially
learn
a
whole
new
trade
to
me
it
be
wonderful
and
amaze
you
only
have
to
visit
poughkeepsie
to
get
a
sense
of
the
fundamental
change
take
place
in
engineering
our
laboratory
back
in
endicott
have
always
felt
to
me
like
a
stuffy
museum
a
place
where
idea
be
scarce
and
have
to
be
jealously
guard
and
preserve
but
poughkeepsie
be
wide
open
the
idea
seem
as
abundant
as
air
and
you
have
the
impression
of
a
limitless
future
the
old
endicott
inventor
work
in
isolation
from
one
another
in
poughkeepsie
everybody
believe
that
collaboration
be
the
only
way
to
move
a
complicate
electronics
project
along
there
be
tremendous
imagination
and
inventiveness
everywhere
you
look
i
remember
walk
into
the
mansion
one
day
and
find
a
hoover
vacuum
cleaner
rig
to
the
base
of
one
of
the
magnetic
tape
machine
i
ask
the
engineer
james
weidenhammer
what
he
be
do
he
told
me
he
have
an
idea
for
use
suction
to
keep
slack
tape
from
get
tangle
it
be
a
very
clever
concept
and
to
this
day
all
high
speed
tape
drive
be
pattern
after
it
the
far
the
defense
calculator
progress
the
more
the
rest
of
ibm
get
involve
the
project
won
some
important
ally
include
red
lamotte
who
by
now
have
become
vice
president
of
sale
and
vin
learson
who
be
sale
manager
of
the
punch
card
division
i
kept
wait
for
dad
to
second
guess
me
on
the
machine
but
he
never
do
instead
dad
publicly
bless
the
project
when
it
reach
its
halfway
mark
he
announce
to
shareholder
at
the
annual
meeting
in
april
that
ibm
be
building
an
electronic
machine
twenty
five
time
faster
than
the
ssec
that
be
go
to
be
rent
and
service
along
with
our
regular
product
he
give
it
a
number
the
ibm
just
like
our
other
product
instead
of
call
it
the
tommiac
or
some
such
which
i
be
grateful
for
i
m
sure
he
must
have
have
his
doubt
in
march
he
have
come
up
to
poughkeepsie
with
the
whole
board
of
director
to
see
the
defense
calculator
prototype
one
of
the
engineer
present
the
machine
get
carry
away
and
say
that
the
future
belong
to
electronic
compute
i
be
later
told
that
dad
look
upset
at
the
emphasis
be
give
to
computer
but
he
never
mention
it
to
me
a
year
earlier
he
d
have
say
hasn
t
anyone
told
that
young
man
that
this
company
s
future
be
still
in
ibm
card
i
think
he
be
make
a
conscious
effort
to
let
me
and
my
machine
have
our
day
dad
be
in
his
mid
seventy
and
slow
down
he
start
come
to
work
later
and
later
in
the
morning
and
after
lunch
he
d
take
a
nap
for
an
hour
or
two
on
the
couch
in
the
anteroom
next
to
his
office
where
he
kept
a
blanket
to
put
over
himself
the
secretary
kept
this
secret
because
dad
like
to
project
an
image
of
absolute
vigor
when
he
appear
in
public
he
be
the
consummate
actor
even
if
he
didn
t
feel
well
he
d
pull
himself
up
and
stride
like
a
man
thirty
year
young
sometimes
he
actually
seem
to
draw
energy
from
work
we
d
be
at
a
conference
and
he
d
tell
me
he
be
dead
tire
and
go
to
lie
down
but
on
his
way
to
the
elevator
he
d
run
into
somebody
he
hadn
t
see
in
a
long
time
and
they
d
start
discuss
business
dad
would
talk
for
twenty
minute
on
his
foot
and
apparently
be
completely
refresh
by
it
but
i
knew
he
wasn
t
as
strong
as
before
and
i
start
be
protective
of
him
when
we
travel
on
a
train
together
i
d
always
go
check
on
him
if
i
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
remember
once
on
a
trip
from
indiana
to
washington
i
look
in
on
him
and
he
wasn
t
there
so
i
put
on
my
clothes
and
start
search
i
found
him
walk
through
the
train
fully
dress
in
a
business
suit
and
tie
i
say
be
you
all
right
dad
yes
i
have
a
peculiar
feel
so
i
thought
i
d
take
a
walk
but
i
m
all
right
probably
he
d
woken
up
and
thought
he
be
go
to
die
i
now
know
that
be
a
feel
all
old
people
sometimes
have
you
wake
up
with
a
start
and
wonder
if
your
time
have
come
he
just
need
to
walk
it
off
in
i
go
with
him
to
a
dinner
one
night
and
he
make
a
poor
speech
the
mason
be
give
him
an
award
at
the
biltmore
hotel
and
all
he
do
in
preparation
be
scribble
a
few
idea
he
thought
he
could
just
wing
it
but
at
age
seventy
six
you
can
t
i
watch
him
fumble
with
his
note
and
felt
embarrass
for
him
afterward
he
ask
me
how
be
it
i
say
it
be
fine
dad
but
you
know
give
speech
take
too
much
out
of
you
you
really
shouldn
t
be
do
it
very
much
i
told
him
that
he
be
of
a
stature
in
business
where
he
could
limit
himself
to
make
two
or
three
minute
of
observation
instead
of
a
full
address
after
that
i
do
what
i
could
to
keep
him
from
get
in
a
bind
in
public
when
it
come
time
for
our
next
annual
meeting
i
get
it
across
to
him
that
if
there
be
go
to
be
flak
in
the
form
of
question
from
professional
gadfly
i
ought
to
take
it
dad
be
perfectly
agreeable
he
realize
he
be
a
little
less
able
in
private
he
still
want
very
much
to
be
bos
but
each
year
he
let
me
run
a
little
more
of
the
annual
meeting
i
never
thought
to
myself
when
be
this
old
gink
go
to
quit
i
remember
at
one
point
george
phillips
say
you
know
tom
your
father
be
seventy
seven
he
s
past
the
age
when
most
people
drop
from
heart
attack
and
cancer
if
those
thing
be
go
to
get
him
they
d
have
gotten
him
by
now
he
may
end
up
living
quite
a
while
i
thought
gee
wouldn
t
that
be
great
i
have
no
feel
of
oh
god
if
he
hang
on
that
long
i
ll
die
most
of
the
time
my
life
be
enrich
by
him
because
i
could
now
give
my
age
father
some
help
and
be
appreciate
for
it
only
when
thing
between
us
get
especially
rough
would
i
go
home
to
olive
and
say
i
wish
dad
would
get
the
hell
out
mainly
i
want
him
there
i
later
have
a
good
friend
on
the
ibm
board
maersk
moller
who
have
to
operate
under
almost
the
same
condition
with
his
old
man
his
father
have
found
one
of
the
world
s
great
shipping
company
a
p
moller
inc
of
copenhagen
denmark
and
maersk
be
suppose
to
succeed
him
old
mr
moller
be
about
ninety
and
he
d
go
into
the
hospital
because
he
be
get
weaker
and
weaker
but
then
he
d
jump
up
out
of
bed
come
down
to
the
office
and
countermand
all
the
order
maersk
have
give
maersk
s
wife
once
told
me
that
if
mr
moller
have
live
another
few
year
maersk
would
have
be
the
one
in
the
hospital
instead
but
maersk
tolerate
it
because
he
have
the
same
dog
devotion
to
his
old
man
as
i
do
to
mine
i
wish
that
my
relationship
with
dad
have
be
such
that
i
could
have
go
into
his
office
put
my
foot
up
and
share
thought
with
him
about
the
future
of
ibm
by
about
i
thought
i
d
learn
the
business
i
understood
what
we
be
do
have
the
confidence
of
williams
and
the
other
young
men
and
knew
where
i
want
ibm
to
go
but
dad
wasn
t
finish
with
me
yet
i
be
still
only
executive
vice
president
and
he
make
it
pretty
clear
that
if
i
want
more
responsibility
i
be
go
to
have
to
keep
fight
him
for
it
every
step
of
the
way
once
when
i
complain
of
his
rough
treatment
dad
growl
i
don
t
have
a
lot
of
time
to
teach
you
and
i
m
do
it
the
only
way
i
know
how
he
be
determine
not
to
stop
until
he
have
test
me
temper
me
and
forge
me
in
his
image
dad
and
i
would
usually
meet
toward
the
end
of
the
day
after
i
have
be
work
tremendously
hard
he
d
only
really
get
go
around
five
o
clock
at
night
which
be
the
time
i
d
want
to
catch
my
train
to
greenwich
but
the
buzzer
would
buzz
and
there
i
d
be
fag
and
dad
would
say
i
m
go
to
send
farwell
to
kalamazoo
which
would
be
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
we
d
agree
on
the
day
before
i
d
say
dad
you
know
we
really
talk
that
through
and
we
decide
it
wasn
t
a
very
good
thing
to
send
farwell
to
kalamazoo
well
i
ve
thought
about
it
far
and
i
ve
change
my
mind
but
i
already
told
farwell
that
you
shouldn
t
have
do
that
he
d
say
and
we
d
be
off
to
the
race
our
bad
fight
be
not
at
the
office
where
outsider
might
hear
but
at
my
parent
townhouse
on
east

i
have
a
late
dinner
in
the

for
the
next
day

them
rather
than
commute
home
to
greenwich
i
d
sleep
in
the
same
bedroom
that
i
have
before
the

back
now

to
my
father
that
opulent
house

everything
he
have
ever
aspire
to
in
life
for
me
it
just
brought
back
memory
of
the
unhappy
year
i
live
there
as
an
ibm
salesman
often
my
parent
would
still
be
out
at
some
social
event
but
i
have
a
key
and
i
d
let
myself
in
in
her
frugal
way
mother
kept
no
nighttime
help
and
all
the
light
would
be
off
except
for
a
dim
ten
watt
bulb
in
the
foyer
so
i
d
turn
some
light
on
there
be
a

of
beautiful
marble
and
along

and
by
the
time
mother
and
dad
come
home
from
their
dinner
party
i
d
be
asleep
dad
would
wake
me
up
under
the
guise
of
say
good
night
he
d
sit
down
on
the
chair
by
the
bed
ask
how
i
be
and
after
a
few
pleasantry
he
d
say
by
the
way
son
i
just
want
to
cover
that
matter
of
the
western
sale
region
once
more
it
never
make
any
difference
that
this
might
be
something
i
d
work
on
over
a
long
period
and
just
gotten
resolve
i

not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
way
it

be
handle
he

in
my
face

the
energy
or
time
to
rebuild
wall
he
mash
down
i
d
come
out
of
a
deep
sleep
and
be
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
in
no
time
the
best
strategy
would
have
be
to
let
him
blow
himself
out
maybe
if
it
have
be
a
m
and
i
d
just
come
back
from
a
week
s
vacation
i
d
have
be
able
to
say
let
me
take
another
look
at
it
but
usually
i
would
come
back
at
him
hard
and
we
d
be
in
one
hellacious
fight
he
d
get
livid
his
jowl
would
shake
all
the
old
family
tension
would
come
boil
out
and
i
d
let
him
have
it
with
everything
i
have
my
mother
would
hear
our
enrage
voice
now
let
me
tell
you
something
don
t
talk
like
that
to
me
it
would
be
in
the
morning
and
finally
she
d
get
up
from
bed
i
can
remember
her
stand
in
the
doorway
in
her
nightdress
with
her
hair
unbrushed
because
she
d
be
asleep
she
never
take
side
she
d
say
can
t
you
boy
just
go
to
sleep
it
would
frequently
end
in
tear
then
dad
and
i
would
hug
and
go
to
bed
frustrate
we
d
swear
we
d
never
do
it
again
and
within
two
or
three
week
there
would
be
another
moment
of
difference
which
would
escalate
into
another
white
hot
argument
it
amazes
me
that
two
people
could
torture
each
other
to
the
degree
dad
and
i
do
and
not
call
it
quits
i
remember
once
we
have
an
awful
battle
in
my
office
and
i
ran
out
of
the
room
down
the
corridor
be
the
office
of
a
distant
cousin
of
dad
s
name
charley
love
i
make
it
as
far
as
charley
love
s
door
threw
myself
on
his
divan
and
sobbed
while
charley
sat
there
at
his
desk
it
must
have
be
a
shock
but
he
be
a
sensitive
guy
and
ask
what
be
the
matter
charley
do
you
have
terrible
fight
with
your
father
when
you
be
grow
up
he
say
of
course
it
be
very
reassure
dad
be
constantly
try
to
change
me
and
i
be
try
to
change
him
i
want
an
easy
old
shoe
pal
and
he
couldn
t
be
that
he
d
have
like
me
to
be
more
pliant
and
defy
him
less
each
of
us
want
something
that
the
other
couldn
t
give
mother
do
what
she
could
to
calm
thing
down
sometimes
she
d
talk
to
me
privately
about
it
she
d
say
i
m
enough
young
than
your
father
to
know
he
be
difficult
i
also
know
that
you
have
to
say
yes
to
him
on
almost
everything
but
you
ve
get
to
remember
he
s
a
very
old
man
it
s
probably
not
good
for
him
to
get
work
up
and
blue
in
the
face
you
d
feel
terrible
if
anything
happen
to
him
while
you
be
have
one
of
those
big
battle
i
don
t
know
how
they
get
start
or
what
you
can
do
to
slow
him
down
but
please
do
as
much
as
you
can
try
to
moderate
it
in
truth
there
wasn
t
much
i
could
do
which
be
why
those
fight
be
so
deeply
disturb
they
be
savage
primal
and
unstoppable
my
father
love
me
and
want
me
to
thrive
i
love
him
and
want
to
see
him
live
his
life
without
trauma
without
embarrassment
without
strain
to
his
health
but
while
i
always
try
to
live
up
to
his
expectation
he
be
never
satisfied
because
no
son
can
ever
totally
please
his
father
and
when
he
criticize
me
i
found
it
impossible
to
hold
back
my
rage
by
that
time
i
have
very
little
doubt
about
my
ability
to
manage
ibm
i
be
much
more
concerned
about
whether
i
d
be
able
to
manage
dad
most
of
our
business
difference
stem
from
the
fact
that
i
have
a
well
feel
than
he
do
for
ibm
s
increase
size
our
business
be
explode
when
i
come
back
from
the
war
it
be
million
a
year
and
by
it
have
more
than
double
dad
be
constantly
torn
between
the
huge
number
we
be
begin
to
deal
with
and
the
way
he
have
manage
the
little
cash
register
company
when
his
bos
mr
patterson
be
away
he
d
call
me
to
his
office
and
say
you
and
al
williams
be
really
mismanage
the
sale
operation
i
d
ask
what
he
meant
and
he
d
say
that
the
only
way
to
keep
track
of
the
business
be
for
branch
and
district
manager
to
read
the
call
report
a
call
report
be
the
write
up
a
salesman
would
hand
in
after
meeting
with
a
prospect
dad
have
read
all
of
the
call
report
when
he
be
a
regional
manager
at
the
cash
so
i
d
have
to
explain
that
he
be
ask
the
impossible
our
salesman
be
average
four
call
a
day
and
in
a
big
office
we
have
forty
salesman
in
a
sale
district
there
would
be
close
to
four
thousand
report
a
day
if
a
manager
read
them
he
wouldn
t
have
time
for
anything
else
this
be
a
big
company
now
with
big
company
problem
i
kept
tell
dad
for
the
same
reason
he
didn
t
want
to
borrow
money
we
be
building
factory
and
churn
out
rental
machine
that
paid
us
back
only
after
several
year
so
the
business
require
an
awful
lot
of
financing
dad
like
the
idea
of
growth
but
he
hat
debt
have
live
through
several
depression
he
felt
you
should
always
have
enough
liquid
asset
to
pay
any
debt
that
be
call
in
we
owe
eighty
five
million
dollar
not
a
lot
consider
we
only
have
to
pay
percent
interest
and
we
could
offset
it
with
the
steady
income
from
our
rental
business
but
dad
harped
on
that
debt
in
meeting
i
cannot
get
that
eighty
five
million
dollar
debt
out
of
my
mind
he
say
it
be
there
all
the
time
it
s
something
which
cannot
be
laugh
off
every
one
of
us
must
think
about
it
all
the
time
dad
s
idea
for
financing
ibm
s
growth
be
to
plow
profit
back
into
the
business
that
be
not
easy
to
do
because
he
also
believe
in
pay
substantial
dividend
to
ibm
s
shareholder
for
year
dad
rely
on
smart
accounting
to
get
around
this
dilemma
instead
of
pay
dividend
in
actual
money
he
paid
in
stock
so
that
if
you
held
one
hundred
share
you
might
get
another
five
share
at
the
end
of
the
year
meanwhile
dad
would
have
his
accountant
put
the
newly
mint
stock
on
ibm
s
balance
sheet
not
at
its
market
value
which
be
something
like
a
share
but
at
a
nominal
value
of
only
five
dollar
that
way
it
only
take
a
small
fraction
of
the
profit
to
balance
it
out
this
be
a
neat
maneuver
and
our
earnings
be
grow
so
fast
that
the
stockholder
be
at
no
risk
but
it
make
authority
at
the
new
york
stock
exchange
nervous
there
be
nothing
to
stop
a
badly
manage
company
unlike
ibm
from
use
new
share
to
disguise
the
fact
that
it
lack
the
profit
to
pay
a
dividend
so
emil
schram
the
head
of
the
stock
exchange
start
a
crackdown
he
make
a
rule
that
stock
issue
as
a
dividend
have
to
be
account
for
at
its
full
market
value
dad
never
accepted
that
every
spring
when
the
time
come
to
declare
the
annual
dividend
he
d
hitch
up
his
belt
and
say
well
i
ve
get
to
go
down
to
wall
street
and
straighten
out
emil
schram
on
this
silly
accounting
business
around
he
take
me
with
him
if
you
d
like
to
come
along
all
right
he
say
but
keep
your
mouth
shut
when
we
get
down
there
he
say
now
emil
i
want
to
show
you
the
record
of
the
business
for
the
last
year
schram
be
a
big
hefty
guy
and
he
d
try
to
stand
up
to
dad
but
for
some
reason
dad
could
always
snow
him
schram
would
say
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
keep
let
you
do
this
i
ll
have
to
let
other
company
do
it
my
company
be
not
like
other
company
just
look
at
our
record
finally
schram
would
let
him
have
his
way
for
another
year
in
schram
retire
and
the
stock
exchange
get
a
new
chief
name
keith
funston
the
former
president
of
trinity
college
in
hartford
connecticut
funston
knew
me
slightly
from
a
business
luncheon
the
year
before
and
he
call
me
up
and
say
my
people
have
told
me
about
your
father
and
his
stock
dividend
i
ve
really
go
into
this
spent
several
hour
on
it
and
we
cannot
let
your
father
do
it
anymore
so
please
prevent
him
from
come
down
here
i
d
hate
to
start
out
in
new
york
by
have
a
fight
with
one
of
the
most
respect
businessmen
in
town
i
told
dad
who
say
that
s
preposterous
preposterous
for
once
i
played
it
fairly
cleverly
by
not
say
anything
i
go
back
to
him
a
second
time
on
it
and
a
third
finally
he
say
all
right
you
go
down
and
make
the
best
deal
you
can
after
that
he
be
always
poor
mouth
keith
funston
he
d
say
you
know
that
fellow
funston
he
s
not
quite
right
he
doesn
t
understand
finance
but
i
like
funston
for
his
grit
and
after
dad
die
i
ask
him
to
join
the
ibm
board
we
need
to
borrow
because
even
if
dad
have
succeed
in
put
every
penny
of
profit
back
into
the
business
it
wouldn
t
have
be
enough
everybody
at
ibm
knew
it
if
t
j
have
be
more
tolerant
of
debt
thing
would
have
go
very
smoothly
but
instead
i
have
williams
and
lamotte
and
everybody
else
come
to
me
and
say
look
here
your
father
doesn
t
want
to
borrow
any
more
and
we
need
the
money
nobody
want
to
tackle
him
so
i
have
to
i
d
go
to
him
and
dad
would
say
the
only
reason
we
need
to
borrow
be
that
you
men
be
spending
in
a
very
careless
way
i
have
a
devil
of
a
time
until
finally
i
hit
upon
the
perfect
argument
i
d
say
all
right
dad
we
don
t
have
to
borrow
but
we
ll
have
to
stop
hire
salesman
because
we
ve
get
all
the
order
we
can
fill
right
now
that
would
just
kill
him
because
he
d
be
a
salesman
himself
and
because
he
believe
salesman
meant
growth
he
d
say
let
me
see
those
number
again
then
he
d
order
his
secretary
to
make
an
appointment
for
us
to
go
see
the
prudential
and
borrow
more
the
toughest
issue
father
and
i
ever
face
be
antitrust
the
truman
administration
be
pretty
hard
on
big
business
with
the
justice
department
win
antimonopoly
case
left
and
right
it
broke
alcoa
s
hold
on
the
aluminum
market
in
and
then
a
few
year
later
force
the
united
shoe
machinery
corporation
to
diversify
and
to
tolerate
competition
from
foreign
manufacturer
we
knew
that
sooner
or
later
the
government
would
come
after
us
our
equipment
be
in
the
accounting
department
of
virtually
every
major
american
company
and
the
government
knew
all
about
us
because
we
be
in
every
federal
agency
too
we
charge
premium
rent
for
a
premium
service
and
our
growth
and
profit
be
astound
year
after
year
we
be
make
about
twenty
seven
cent
pre
tax
on
every
dollar
of
revenue
yet
as
lucrative
as
the
business
be
we
d
attract
very
little
competition
and
we
still
held
about
percent
of
the
market
for
punch
card
machine
to
the
justice
department
all
of
this
be
proof
that
ibm
be
a
monopoly
right
after
the
war
they
begin
investigate
us
and
snoop
around
sometimes
the
investigation
seem
to
die
down
but
then
we
d
report
another
record
year
or
the
antitrust
division
would
win
some
other
big
case
and
they
d
be
after
us
again
dad
do
not
approach
this
problem
in
a
good
frame
of
mind
the
terrible
trauma
of
get
sentence
to
jail
for
antitrust
violation
when
he
be
at
the
cash
never
really
pass
for
dad
thirty
five
year
have
go
by
but
it
be
like
a
raw
wound
to
his
self
respect
he
swore
we
would
fight
to
the
bitter
end
most
entrepreneur
would
sympathize
with
his
point
of
view
ibm
be
a
success
not
because
we
drove
other
people
out
of
business
but
because
we
have
good
product
superior
salesman
a
lot
of
satisfied
customer
include
the
federal
government
and
because
we
kept
our
energy
concentrate
on
punch
card
dad
didn
t
see
how
any
of
this
could
be
bad
what
be
the
law
against
building
a
great
business
and
if
it
wasn
t
illegal
why
be
ibm
be
hound
the
thing
dad
could
never
accept
about
monopoly
law
be
that
you
don
t
have
to
do
anything
wrong
to
be
in
the
wrong
the
department
of
justice
be
come
after
us
entirely
because
they
didn
t
think
there
be
enough
competition
in
our
market
dad
be
sure
of
his
ground
he
take
out
full
page
newspaper
ad
praise
the
free
enterprise
system
and
he
told
the
government
that
we
would
cooperate
fully
because
we
have
nothing
to
hide
he
turn
over
thousand
of
page
of
document
and
spent
many
hour
in
meeting
with
government
lawyer
patiently
explain
his
business
philosophy
and
ibm
s
business
practice
once
in
a
while
the
justice
department
would
do
something
that
drove
him
wild
such
as
the
time
they
sent
in
agent
pose
as
anti
espionage
expert
and
go
through
our
foreign
trade
record
but
dad
fully
expect
that
the
government
would
eventually
see
the
light
not
only
do
he
want
them
to
desist
he
want
a
full
public
exoneration
of
ibm
he
told
us
executive
in
a
meeting
once
if
they
be
willing
to
acknowledge
that
we
have
not
violate
the
law
the
very
best
thing
they
can
do
would
be
to
make
a
statement
to
that
effect
include
a
reference
to
our
fair
policy
of
give
good
service
to
our
user
and
raise
in
pay
and
other
benefit
to
our
employee
a
statement
of
this
kind
would
prove
to
the
public
that
the
department
of
justice
when
it
know
the
fact
stand
for
justice
but
the
investigation
ground
on
and
finally
dad
ask
for
an
appointment
with
attorney
general
tom
clark
dad
thought
we
might
persuade
him
to
call
off
the
attack
before
the
thing
go
to
court
like
many
monopoly
case
this
one
really
come
down
to
how
you
define
the
market
and
dad
give
me
the
job
of
present
our
definition
for
the
attorney
general
s
benefit
i
put
up
a
big
diagram
that
represent
the
accounting
world
as
a
pyramid
the
point
be
simple
if
you
define
the
market
as
the
entire
world
of
business
calculation
then
we
have
lot
of
competition
and
the
huge
bulk
of
the
business
belong
to
the
maker
of
ordinary
pencil
and
paper
by
comparison
ibm
be
very
small
i
give
a
few
government
statistic
to
drive
home
our
point
a
congressional
committee
have
estimate
ibm
be
do
only
about
percent
of
the
accounting
work
in
the
u
s
accord
to
commerce
department
figure
we
constitute
only
nine
percent
of
the
total
man
hour
of
production
worker
in
the
office
and
store
machine
industry
our
own
estimate
straight
out
of
dad
s
head
be
that
ibm
only
do
about
two
percent
of
all
the
numerical
calculation
in
american
business
we
aren
t
a
monopoly
i
told
the
attorney
general
in
fact
we
ve
barely
scratch
the
surface
dad
point
out
that
he
d
turn
down
any
number
of
chance
to
buy
out
the
competition
in
other
part
of
the
office
equipment
pyramid
over
the
year
people
have
try
to
sell
him
the
patent
for
all
sort
of
machine
he
d
have
the
chance
to
acquire
underwood
typewriter
eckert
mauchly
computer
and
other
company
after
john
h
patterson
s
death
in
national
cash
register
s
investment
banker
propose
that
dad
merge
ibm
with
the
cash
and
run
them
both
dad
turn
all
of
this
down
and
he
told
the
attorney
general
that
prove
he
be
no
monopolist
of
course
to
the
justice
department
all
this
be
beside
the
point
but
it
show
something
important
about
my
father
s
think
as
he
once
told
my
mother
i
m
no
genius
i
m
smart
in
spot
but
i
stay
around
those
spot
he
be
look
at
other
product
and
company
all
the
time
yet
he
remain
convince
that
the
great
potential
be
in
punch
card
he
like
to
quote
a
say
that
sum
up
his
philosophy
shoemaker
stick
to
your
last
without
his
devotion
to
punch
card
ibm
would
have
lose
its
focus
it
might
have
become
a
hodgepodge
conglomerate
like
remington
rand
sometimes
dad
stuck
to
his
last
a
little
too
closely
we
come
close
to
miss
the
computer
business
for
example
and
in
dad
turn
down
the
chance
to
buy
the
patent
for
xerography
the
inventor
chester
carlson
come
over
from
queen
and
offer
them
to
dad
before
found
the
company
that
eventually
become
xerox
that
be
the
big
opportunity
my
old
man
ever
miss
the
attorney
general
be
not
persuade
by
our
pyramid
and
i
couldn
t
blame
him
because
i
wasn
t
convince
myself
probably
the
only
person
in
the
room
who
fully
believe
our
argument
be
dad
that
s
because
he
be
the
only
one
with
the
vision
to
see
that
pyramid
as
one
big
open
market
he
really
thought
punch
card
accounting
have
potential
that
far
reach
he
would
have
told
you
that
accounting
machine
would
someday
take
business
away
from
the
pencil
just
as
personal
computer
do
today
but
tom
clark
didn
t
see
it
that
way
he
listen
and
then
he
simply
say
we
think
punch
card
machine
be
a
separate
industry
of
course
we
do
monopolize
there
if
dad
have
be
reasonable
on
the
subject
we
could
have
settle
the
matter
then
the
justice
department
thought
we
need
competition
but
they
weren
t
ask
for
anything
drastic
like
break
ibm
up
they
thought
it
would
be
sufficient
if
we
simply
loosen
our
hold
on
the
market
by
grant
license
to
other
people
to
manufacture
under
some
of
our
patent
and
by
put
up
our
machine
for
sale
as
well
as
rental
the
natural
force
of
competition
would
then
do
the
rest
this
would
mean
some
complicate
change
in
our
business
but
i
didn
t
think
it
would
hurt
us
as
badly
as
fight
the
case
in
court
might
since
the
s
the
government
have
won
percent
of
its
antitrust
case
and
if
we
fought
and
lose
the
court
might
well
take
the
company
apart
but
when
i
propose
to
dad
that
we
settle
the
case
he
be
adamant
to
him
a
settlement
be
the
same
as
an
admission
of
guilt
our
lawyer
only
make
matter
bad
the
partner
in
ibm
s
usual
law
firm
knew
we
ought
to
settle
they
be
the
one
who
initially
convince
me
of
it
but
they
be
not
as
aggressive
with
dad
as
i
thought
they
should
have
be
it
be
very
hard
to
tell
my
father
he
be
wrong
he
be
so
exercise
by
antitrust
that
he
d
latch
onto
anybody
who
agree
with
his
position
he
hire
an
additional
lawyer
in
washington
name
joseph
keenan
to
help
negotiate
with
the
justice
department
keenan
be
a
retire
federal
judge
but
he
be
a
wormy
guy
a
fixer
he
told
dad
these
thing
can
always
be
handle
mr
watson
and
sent
a
fantastic
bill
but
the
investigation
kept
march
ahead
around
to
my
great
relief
dad
brought
in
a
third
lawyer
this
be
judge
robert
patterson
who
have
be
truman
s
first
secretary
of
war
and
be
a
great
man
the
minute
patterson
come
in
he
told
father
there
be
no
fix
this
kind
of
case
and
that
keenan
have
to
go
dad
put
patterson
on
our
board
and
i
have
high
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
make
dad
see
the
light
while
dad
be
in
europe
in
patterson
go
over
to
spend
time
with
him
and
i
ask
him
if
he
d
talk
to
dad
about
settle
the
case
he
spent
half
the
summer
with
dad
but
i
didn
t
hear
anything
and
when
patterson
finally
come
back
i
take
him
to
lunch
well
do
you
get
dad
to
come
around
i
say
i
ll
tell
you
the
honest
to
god
truth
he
say
i
didn
t
i
be
indignant
be
you
kid
you
be
over
there
six
week
what
do
you
do
tom
he
say
it
s
pretty
doggone
hard
to
sway
your
father
when
he
doesn
t
want
to
be
swayed
i
understood
that
but
i
d
be
hop
patterson
could
wash
that
particular
piece
of
dirty
laundry
for
me
maybe
patterson
could
eventually
have
gotten
him
to
change
his
mind
but
he
never
have
the
chance
the
justice
department
file
its
suit
against
ibm
on
january
the
follow
day
patterson
die
in
a
plane
crash
dad
and
i
be
so
addict
to
fight
that
we
even
manage
to
make
a
struggle
out
of
my
promotion
to
president
of
ibm
by
al
williams
and
i
be
essentially
run
the
company
day
to
day
with
dad
tune
in
and
out
to
check
on
us
or
make
a
major
decision
while
spending
most
of
his
time
work
out
the
kink
in
world
trade
george
phillips
be
still
in
between
us
and
my
father
and
the
arrangement
still
wasn
t
work
well
williams
and
i
would
get
all
set
to
do
something
we
d
tell
phillips
and
he
d
say
to
go
ahead
but
then
he
d
talk
to
dad
who
d
say
that
s
the
most
ridiculous
thing
i
ever
heard
and
old
phillips
would
reef
his
sail
and
turn
round
and
round
i
never
really
blame
phillips
he
be
totally
loyal
to
dad
and
everybody
need
a
few
people
like
that
but
by
the
spring
of
as
i
be
press
to
get
the
defense
calculator
underway
it
happen
once
too
often
i
don
t
remember
what
the
issue
be
but
i
storm
into
dad
s
office
god
damn
it
i
say
you
ve
get
your
secretary
as
the
president
of
this
company
he
ll
agree
to
something
i
want
to
do
then
talk
to
you
and
reverse
himself
my
father
sent
me
out
to
the
anteroom
where
he
take
his
nap
then
he
call
phillips
in
some
mumbo
jumbo
go
on
in
there
and
then
he
call
me
back
in
they
both
turn
toward
me
and
dad
say
we
ve
decide
to
make
you
president
i
d
expect
to
keep
fight
and
dad
could
see
he
d
knock
me
speechless
what
s
the
matter
he
say
don
t
you
want
the
job
i
want
to
feel
that
he
consider
my
succession
to
the
presidency
a
major
victory
of
his
life
along
with
his
win
of
my
mother
and
the
record
he
have
make
at
ibm
over
so
many
year
instead
he
do
it
as
though
it
be
a
way
to
prevent
another
argument
i
felt
crush
dad
seem
alienate
too
and
left
on
a
business
trip
without
say
another
word
to
me
or
even
write
a
note
instead
he
have
phillips
send
a
letter
confirm
our
conversation
all
the
same
dad
go
through
with
the
promotion
set
thing
up
so
that
i
would
take
over
as
president
in
january
meanwhile
phillips
get
a
raise
and
a
promotion
to
the
new
job
of
vice
chairman
where
dad
continued
to
use
him
as
a
buffer
i
have
more
autonomy
than
before
but
i
still
have
to
go
through
phillips
on
important
matter
of
finance
and
the
like
and
dad
still
use
him
to
second
guess
me
on
the
day
before
my
official
promotion
hop
that
become
president
would
somehow
make
my
relationship
with
dad
smoother
and
happier
i
write
a
letter
to
thank
him
and
to
try
to
set
a
new
tone
dear
dad
i
be
deeply
grateful
that
you
be
do
what
you
be
do
tomorrow
i
love
my
work
and
the
company
but
in
addition
i
believe
that
through
this
move
your
life
can
be
make
far
far
pleasanter
you
be
and
always
will
be
mr
ibm
to
all
of
us
and
the
advice
and
counsel
you
have
give
me
have
be
responsible
for
percent
of
my
present
qualification
i
would
hope
that
you
would
be
willing
to
remain
as
ibm
s
chief
executive
for
year
to
come
give
mr
phillips
and
me
your
idea
on
the
policy
and
top
decision
of
the
company
and
perhaps
leave
some
of
the
dirty
detail
to
us
i
share
your
belief
that
this
company
can
continue
to
grow
rapidly
my
incentive
be
great
salary
stock
etc
but
without
either
i
would
still
love
my
job
as
long
as
i
have
a
living
because
ibm
be
your
company
and
i
be
your
son
i
have
always
look
to
the
day
of
my
promotion
to
president
of
ibm
as
a
day
of
complete
fulfillment
for
me
of
course
i
will
be
happy
but
i
will
not
have
the
sense
of
fulfillment
i
want
until
i
see
in
your
face
and
your
eye
that
my
work
and
accomplishment
be
make
you
happy
no
son
ever
believe
more
deeply
in
a
father
than
i
believe
in
you
with
love
tom
as
it
turn
out
the
next
six
month
be
sheer
utter
hell
ibm
have
just
pass
the
quarter
billion
dollar
a
year
mark
and
there
be
too
much
to
do
too
many
decision
to
be
make
i
be
work
frantically
call
on
important
customer
push
into
electronics
and
try
to
stop
the
antitrust
case
before
it
do
any
real
damage
i
be
also
spending
a
lot
of
time
outside
ibm
on
the
boy
scout
and
a
whole
range
of
other
public
service
job
my
new
position
include
a
lot
of
ceremonial
responsibility
give
speech
at
convention
and
visit
office
all
over
the
country
to
hold
family
dinner
as
dad
call
them
with
the
people
who
work
there
administrative
duty
tie
up
too
much
of
my
time
for
example
the
wage
of
everybody
in
the
company
have
to
be
raise
partly
because
of
inflation
and
partly
because
dad
be
aware
that
labor
union
be
win
big
pay
increase
in
other
industry
any
other
company
would
have
simply
announce
a
general
raise
from
headquarters
but
that
be
not
dad
s
way
he
thought
declare
a
general
pay
increase
would
undermine
the
relationship
of
individual
worker
and
their
manager
and
give
union
an
opening
by
make
employee
receptive
to
the
idea
of
collective
bargaining
so
every
raise
at
ibm
have
to
be
present
as
an
individual
ment
increase
award
to
each
employee
by
his
bos
instead
of
tell
a
department
of
twenty
people
that
they
be
all
get
a
raise
their
manager
have
to
have
twenty
separate
interview
he
d
tell
each
person
the
same
thing
you
ve
do
a
good
job
here
s
your
raise
when
we
give
a
general
increase
ten
of
thousand
of
these
interview
have
to
be
coordinate
all
over
the
company
and
business
would
just
about
grind
to
a
halt
the
employee
knew
full
well
what
we
be
do
of
course
it
be
one
of
the
time
when
ibm
probably
remind
some
of
them
of
the
ritual
of
life
in
the
army
the
frustration
of
work
with
dad
make
me
pretty
demand
of
other
people
when
i
go
out
to
inspect
a
sale
office
i
be
not
by
any
mean
a
benevolent
patsy
passing
through
and
say
everything
be
rosy
instead
i
d
be
smart
from
all
the
anger
inside
me
and
i
d
pas
a
bit
of
it
along
but
usually
only
a
bit
i
knew
that
i
be
likely
to
see
the
people
at
a
give
office
only
once
every
two
or
three
year
so
i
held
myself
back
for
the
practical
reason
that
if
i
make
them
too
sore
the
hard
feeling
would
just
stay
out
there
and
fester
and
hurt
the
business
i
often
end
up
carry
my
frustration
home
with
me
where
my
wife
and
child
would
bear
the
brunt
by
now
olive
and
i
have
tom
jeannette
olive
and
cindy
range
in
age
from
eight
down
to
two
olive
would
spend
the
entire
day
work
with
them
and
she
d
have
them
all
shin
up
and
ready
to
greet
me
when
i
come
home
i
d
come
in
the
door
and
say
that
child
s
sock
isn
t
pull
up
that
child
s
hair
isn
t
combed
what
be
these
box
do
here
in
the
hall
they
should
have
be
mail
it
be
the
same
demand
ibm
attitude
and
it
be
very
hard
on
them
all
i
don
t
think
my
father
realize
how
far
he
be
push
me
there
be
time
when
i
wonder
if
i
be
go
to
have
a
nervous
breakdown
that
summer
one
of
the
manager
in
our
typewriter
division
die
in
california
he
be
a
fairly
senior
guy
married
to
a
woman
who
have
a
vindictive
personality
for
some
reason
she
have
the
idea
that
he
have
be
unfairly
treat
by
ibm
and
when
he
die
she
told
somebody
she
be
go
to
sue
the
company
because
his
heart
have
fail
from
lift
heavy
typewriter
when
i
heard
that
i
thought
it
would
be
important
to
show
some
respect
by
be
at
his
funeral
in
those
day
that
meant
a
nine
hour
flight
on
a
propeller
driven
airliner
call
a
constellation
just
as
i
be
leave
for
the
airport
dad
call
me
in
and
we
have
a
terrible
argument
finally
i
say
i
can
t
talk
to
you
anymore
i
have
an
airplane
to
catch
and
i
walk
out
dad
go
down
and
get
in
his
limousine
and
somehow
beat
me
to
the
airport
wiz
miller
the
head
of
the
typewriter
division
be
travel
with
me
and
when
we
get
to
la
guardia
field
and
start
walk
out
to
the
airplane
on
the
tarmac
i
saw
my
father
he
be
a
very
old
man
then
seventy
eight
and
i
remember
him
painfully
make
his
way
out
from
the
shadow
under
the
terminal
building
where
his
car
be
park
i
thought
he
be
play
his
age
for
all
it
be
worth
he
slowly
come
up
to
me
across
that
tarmac
and
with
a
lot
of
people
stand
around
watch
this
curious
scene
he
reach
out
his
gnarl
hand
and
take
my
arm
i
completely
lose
my
temper
god
damn
you
old
man
can
t
you
ever
leave
me
alone
i
say
i
didn
t
strike
him
but
i
ripped
my
arm
away
with
great
vigor
turn
my
back
and
go
up
into
the
plane
that
flight
be
the
long
nine
hour
i
ever
spent
in
my
life
i
be
beside
myself
terrify
that
he
d
be
dead
before
i
could
talk
to
him
again
and
that
i
be
go
to
have
to
live
the
rest
of
my
life
with
the
knowledge
that
i
d
curse
my
father
when
we
land
i
couldn
t
wait
to
get
to
a
phone
to
tell
him
how
sorry
i
be
that
fight
pass
like
all
our
other
fight
but
it
shook
me
up
badly
i
think
it
be
the
first
time
i
ever
really
understood
that
my
father
might
die
on
some
level
i
start
to
realize
i
could
no
longer
afford
to
act
like
an
adolescent
i
take
my
family
on
vacation
that
fall
even
though
i
d
be
president
for
less
than
a
year
we
all
need
the
time
off
we
spent
a
quiet
two
week
in
a
wood
frame
house
on
fisher
island
off
the
connecticut
coast
i
played
with
my
son
and
daughter
and
thought
a
lot
about
dad
then
i
take
another
week
sail
down
the
eastern
seaboard
with
williams
and
learson
and
some
of
the
other
executive
i
d
come
to
count
on
that
give
me
even
more
time
to
sort
thing
out
finally
on
a
train
trip
a
few
day
after
we
docked
i
take
out
a
yellow
pad
and
write
down
the
affection
and
tenderness
i
felt
for
the
old
man
dear
dad
i
ve
be
think
about
this
letter
ever
since
i
start
for
the
chesapeake
on
that
sail
down
with
the
ibm
boy
i
begin
to
think
of
our
year
together
my
main
theme
seem
to
be
to
realize
again
and
again
how
very
wonderful
fair
and
understand
you
have
always
be
to
me
i
have
always
realize
this
but
it
becomes
more
clear
when
i
have
a
son
of
my
own
to
work
with
i
only
hope
that
he
may
think
of
me
when
he
s
grown
the
way
i
think
of
you
of
course
i
hope
he
won
t
argue
and
defy
me
as
often
as
i
have
you
because
i
know
how
painful
that
can
be
to
a
father
i
so
well
remember
the
problem
i
give
you
in
the
short
hill
school
when
you
be
on
that
board
and
i
return
to
the
school
when
i
be
at
carteret
and
get
in
a
mud
fight
that
be
report
to
the
board
you
be
patient
i
be
afraid
i
wouldn
t
have
be
then
i
ve
thought
of
your
constant
problem
with
me
and
my
mark
and
your
ability
never
to
lose
your
temper
about
my
schoolwork
i
remember
so
well
the
morning
you
and
i
start
out
from
camden
with
the
avow
purpose
of
find
a
college
which
would
accept
me
i
m
so
glad
brown
do
then
the
fly
problem
and
all
the
way
through
our
relationship
no
forbid
just
reason
i
pray
that
i
may
do
it
the
same
way
with
tom
i
m
disappointed
that
i
haven
t
be
a
well
son
in
countless
way
you
and
mother
have
always
set
me
such
a
sterling
example
but
i
m
still
pitch
and
i
always
want
to
make
you
both
proud
every
detail
of
our
moment
together
flood
in
on
me
and
have
for
the
past
three
week
like
a
pleasant
cloud
we
ve
have
our
battle
and
i
soberly
believe
that
in
case
out
of
you
be
right
and
in
the
other
ten
a
well
son
would
have
held
his
tongue
i
ve
write
you
a
dozen
time
dad
and
say
that
i
would
do
well
but
somehow
i
ve
felt
different
ever
since
i
go
south
i
want
so
to
have
you
satisfied
what
i
m
try
to
say
be
that
i
love
and
respect
you
deeply
and
want
to
have
a
chance
to
try
again
to
show
you
the
company
be
your
shadow
and
health
and
i
hope
that
i
can
help
keep
it
that
way
i
want
your
direction
and
advice
in
the
business
as
i
have
never
want
it
before
and
would
like
to
spend
most
of
my
time
with
you
while
you
be
in
if
we
can
work
it
out
this
letter
probably
isn
t
convey
what
i
feel
in
my
heart
but
i
want
to
try
anyway
what
i
mean
essentially
be
that
no
one
could
have
do
a
well
or
more
sympathetic
job
of
be
parent
than
you
and
mother
and
now
i
m
go
to
try
harder
than
ever
to
make
you
proud
love
tom
i
be
very
glad
i
write
that
letter
because
i
think
it
be
the
happiest
moment
i
ever
give
my
father
dear
tom
after
reading
your
letter
my
heart
be
so
fill
with
joy
i
cannot
think
of
anything
else
so
i
be
go
home
and
let
mother
read
it
and
we
will
have
a
quiet
and
happy
time
fill
with
kindest
thought
and
prayer
for
your
happiness
and
usefulness
to
your
family
and
the
watson
clan
as
a
whole
and
i
know
we
can
help
you
and
you
can
help
us
i
just
can
t
write
any
more
today
but
you
can
imagine
and
realize
what
be
in
my
heart
and
will
fill
mother
s
heart
as
soon
as
i
reach
home
may
god
bless
and
keep
you
and
help
me
to
be
a
well
father
to
you
and
olive
with
a
heart
fill
with
love
dad
the
letter
didn
t
end
our
fight
but
some
of
the
bitterness
go
out
of
it
on
both
side
one
day
in
the
early
s
i
stop
off
in
washington

one
of
those
univac
machine
at
the
census
bureau
now
and
soon
they
ll
have
another
people
be
excite
about
it
they
ve
shove
a
couple
of
our
tabulator
off
to
the
side
to
make
room
i
knew
all
about
the
univac
of
course
but
the
census
bureau
be
where
punch
card
machine
get
their
start
back
in
the
s
and
it
have
always
be
ibm
s
backyard
i
thought
my
god
here
we
be
try
to
build
defense
calculator
while
univac
be
smart
enough
to
start
take
all
the
civilian
business
away
i
be
terrify
i
come
back
to
new
york
in
the
late
afternoon
and
call
a
meeting
that
stretch
long
into
the
night
there
wasn
t
a
single
solitary
soul
in
ibm
who
grasped
even
a
hundredth
of
the
potential
the
computer
have
we
couldn
t
visualize
it
but
the
one
thing
we
could
understand
be
that
we
be
lose
business
some
of
our
engineer
already
have
a
fledgling
effort
under
way
to
design
a
computer
for
commercial
application
we
decide
to
turn
this
into
a
major
push
to
counter
univac
two
and
a
half
year
later
this
product
would
finally
come
out
as
the
ibm
but
the
name
it
have
while
it
be
still
in
the
lab
be
the
tape
processing
machine
it
be
obvious
to
everyone
that
we
be
finally
make
major
stride
away
from
my
father
s
beloved
punch
card
now
we
have
two
major
computer
project
run
side
by
side
we
have
team
of
engineer
work
three
shift
around
the
clock
and
every
monday
morning
i
d
ignore
all
my
other
responsibility
until
i
d
spent
a
few
hour
with
the
project
manager
and
press
them
on
how
we
be
do
people
at
ibm
invent
the
term
panic
mode
to
describe
the
way
we
work
there
be
moment
when
i
thought
we
be
all
on
board
the
titanic
one
morning
in
mcdowell
come
to
me
with
a
new
analysis
of
what
the
defense
calculator
be
go
to
cost
you
re
not
go
to
like
this
he
say
it
turn
out
that
the
price
we
d
be
quote
to
customer
be
too
low
by
half
the
machine
we
thought
would
cost
a
month
be
actually
go
to
cost
somewhere
between
and
we
have
no
choice
but
to
go
around
and
let
the
customer
know
to
my
total
amazement
we
manage
to
hang
on
to
as
many
order
as
we
d
start
with
that
be
when
i
felt
a
real
eureka
clearly
we
d
tapped
a
new
and
powerful
source
of
demand
customer
want
computer
so
badly
that
we
could
double
the
price
and
still
not
drive
people
away
we
knew
univac
be
year
ahead
of
us
bad
still
remington
rand
seem
to
be
make
all
the
right
move
on
election
night
as
dwight
eisenhower
be
beating
adlai
stevenson
a
univac
appear
on
cbs
the
network
have
agree
to
use
the
computer
for
project
election
result
so
million
of
people
be
introduce
to
the
univac
by
edward
r
murrow
eric
sevareid
and
walter
cronkite
who
call
it
that
marvelous
electronic
brain
it
perform
flawlessly
so
well
that
the
people
run
it
didn
t
believe
what
it
told
them
all
the
preelection
poll
have
predict
a
close
race
but
on
the
basis
of
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
return
the
univac
say
eisenhower
be
go
to
win
by
a
substantial
margin
that
make
the
remington
rand
people
so
nervous
that
they
disconnect
a
part
of
the
univac
s
memory
to
bring
its
prediction
in
line
with
the
poll
but
the
machine
be
right
and
at
the
end
of
the
even
an
engineer
come
on
screen
and
sheepishly
admit
what
he
d
do
remington
rand
s
machine
become
so
famous
that
when
our
first
computer
come
out
we
found
it
be
refer
to
as
ibm
s
univac
the
defense
calculator
or
the
ibm
as
it
be
officially
call
come
off
the
production
line
in
december
in
some
way
it
be
different
from
any
computer
that
have
ever
be
built
we
d
thought
of
it
as
a
product
not
a
laboratory
device
right
from
the
start
so
in
spite
of
its
enormous
complexity
we
built
it
in
the
factory
not
the
engineering
lab
it
also
look
different
from
other
computer
because
we
d
design
it
to
be
easy
to
ship
and
install
other
machine
consist
of
oversize
rack
and
panel
that
be
to
be
deliver
in
piece
and
painstakingly
assemble
in
the
customer
s
office
the
univac
have
a
main
cabinet
about
the
size
of
a
small
truck
but
the
be
make
up
of
separate
module
each
roughly
the
size
of
a
large
refrigerator
that
could
fit
onto
ordinary
freight
elevator
our
engineer
could
uncrate
the
unit
cable
them
together
and
have
them
do
useful
work
in
three
day
any
other
machine
take
a
minimum
of
a
week
dad
want
to
launch
the
with
all
the
usual
ibm
fanfare
in
part
because
we
need
to
divert
attention
from
univac
so
we
ship
the
first
to
new
york
instal
it
on
the
ground
floor
of
headquarters
and
get
ready
for
a
big
dedication
to
make
room
for
the
new
machine
we
dismantle
the
ssec
dad
s
giant
calculator
to
end
all
calculator
be
only
five
year
old
but
already
obsolete
thanks
to
the
rapid
progress
of
electronics
the

he
give
a
speech
call
the
a
tribute
to
the

s
high
splendor
and
in
our

we
brag
that
the
would
shatter
the

barrier
confront
technician
work
on
vital

project
our
visitor
be
impressed
with
the
new
computer
and
newspaper
all
over
the
country
picked
up
the
story
but
the
noisy
reaction
come
from
the
big
customer
who
have
be
push
us
for
year
to
start
building
computer
now
that
we
d
deliver
the
for
scientific
use
they
want
us
to
announce
the
computer
we
be
design
for
business
stop
fiddle
around
say
my
time
inc
friend
roy
larsen
show
us
what
you
ve
get
so
we
can
decide
whether
to
buy
a
univac
even
at
this
late
date
some
of
our
punch
card
executive
be
still
insist
that
computer
would
never
be
economical
but
the
fact
that
we
have
customer
wait
help
me
to
override
their
objection
we
announce
the
ibm
in
september
and
in
the
space
of
eight
month
we
have
order
for
fifty
of
them
meanwhile
i
turn
my
attention
to
the
most
important
sale
of
my
career
in
the
s
dad
have
be
able
to
boost
ibm
into
the
top
echelon
of
corporation
by
supply
punch
card
machine
for
social
security
and
the
new
deal
there
be
no
such
massive
social
program
under
truman
or
eisenhower
for
us
to
tap
into
it
be
the
cold
war
that
help
ibm
make
itself
the
king
of
the
computer
business
after
the
russian
explode
their
first
atom
bomb
in
the
air
force
decide
that
america
need
a
sophisticated
air
defense
system
they
also
decide
this
should
incorporate
computer
a
very
bold
idea
for
the
time
because
computer
be
still
little
more
than
experiment
the
government
give
a
contract
to
mit
and
some
of
the
country
s
best
engineer
there
drew
up
plan
for
a
vast
computer
and
radar
network
which
be
suppose
to
blanket
the
united
state
operate
around
the
clock
and
calculate
the
location
course
and
speed
of
any
incoming
bomber
the
military
name
for
this
system
be
semi
automatic
ground
environment
or
sage
air
defense
until
then
consist
of
a
few
scatter
radar
station
where
observer
do
calculation
on
slide
rule
and
then
plot
flight
path
by
hand
the
faster
airplane
become
the
harder
they
be
to
track
an
air
defense
commander
might
get
redundant
message
from
two
or
three
different
radar
operator
who
each
thought
he
have
spot
something
the
idea
of
sage
be
to
avoid
confusion
the
commander
could
use
it
to
monitor
his
entire
region
and
transmit
order
to
his
interceptor
and
antiaircraft
battery
the
mit
engineer
responsible
for
procure
the
sage
computer
be
jay
forrester
an
austere
man
about
my
age
who
be
driven
by
a
belief
that
computer
could
be
make
to
do
more
than
anyone
thought
in
the
summer
of
he
be
travel
around
the
industry
visit
the
five
company
in
the
run
rca
raytheon
remington
rand
sylvania
and
ibm
and
everybody
be
pull
out
the
stop
rca
and
sylvania
trot
him
through
their
huge
vacuum
tube
factory
that
be
supply
everyone
in
the
industry
remington
rand
show
off
the
univac
and
brought
in
as
their
spokesman
the
famous
general
leslie
grove
during
the
war
grove
have
be
the
bos
of
the
manhattan
project
which
built
the
atom
bomb
i
try
not
to
worry
about
grove
or
the
other
competitor
i
just
let
ibm
speak
for
itself
i
take
forrester
to
see
our
plant
and
introduce
him
to
our
most
gift
people
he
be
under
extreme
pressure
to
get
the
system
into
production
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
think
what
impressed
him
be
the
fact
that
we
be
already
building
computer
in
a
factory
we
won
a
small
contract
for
the
first
stage
of
the
project
to
build
prototype
computer
in
conjunction
with
mit
to
make
sage
possible
the
computer
have
to
work
in
a
way
computer
have
never
work
before
in
those
day
compute
be
typically
do
in
what
be
call
batch
mode
this
meant
that
you
would
collect
your
data
first
feed
it
into
the
machine
second
then
sit
back
for
a
little
while
until
the
answer
come
out
you
could
think
of
the
batch
processor
as
a
high
diver
at
a
circus
each
performance
involves
a
lengthy
drum
roll
in
preparation
a
very
fast
dive
and
then
a
splash
but
the
sage
system
be
suppose
to
keep
track
of
a
large
air
defense
picture
that
be
change
every
instant
that
meant
it
have
to
take
a
constant
stream
of
new
radar
information
and
digest
it
continually
in
what
be
call
real
time
so
a
sage
computer
be
more
like
a
juggler
who
have
to
keep
a
half
dozen
ball
in
the
air
constantly
throw
aside
old
ball
as
his
assistant
toss
him
new
one
from
every
direction
as
if
real
time
compute
be
not
enough
of
a
technical
challenge
the
air
force
also
want
the
system
to
be
absolutely
reliable
in
those
day
it
be
consider
an
accomplishment
if
someone
could
build
a
computer
that
would
work
a
full
eight
hour
day
without
fail
but
sage
be
suppose
to
operate
flawlessly
around
the
clock
year
in
and
year
out
when
russia
explode
its
first
hydrogen
bomb
in
the
summer
of
the
need
to
finish
sage
become
even
more
urgent
we
take
many
of
our
top
engineer
off
our
other
computer
and
put
them
to
work
with
forrester
and
his
men
a
year
after
we
start
we
have
seven
hundred
people
on
the
sage
project
and
it
take
only
fourteen
month
to
design
and
build
a
prototype
that
would
do
the
job
it
be
a
monster
of
a
machine
far
large
than
any
computer
that
have
ever
be
produce
the
air
force
call
it
the
an
fsq
or
q
for
short
and
it
have
fifty
thousand
vacuum
tube
and
dozen
of
cabinet
spread
out
across
a
large
warehouse
it
be
so
big
that
even
though
electricity
in
wire
travel
at
close
to
the
speed
of
light
signal
sometimes
take
too
long
to
get
from
one
part
of
the
computer
to
another
although
we
d
built
a
successful
prototype
we
weren
t
guaranteed
the
next
stage
of
the
project
the
lion
s
share
of
sage
the
contract
to
manufacture
and
service
the
dozen
of
computer
that
would
make
up
the
actual
system
be
still
up
for
grab
i
thought
it
be
absolutely
essential
to
ibm
s
future
that
we
win
it
the
company
that
built
those
computer
be
go
to
be
way
ahead
of
the
game
because
it
would
learn
the
secret
of
mass
production
we
have
the
inside
track
because
we
d
built
the
prototype
but
there
be
time
in
our
dealing
with
mit
when
i
thought
we
d
blown
it
forrester
be
a
genius
at
computer
hardware
but
he
didn
t
appreciate
how
hard
it
be
to
set
up
a
reliable
production
process
he
thought
we
be
handle
the
project
all
wrong
his
idea
of
management
be
what
he
call
the
man
on
the
white
horse
principle
the
man
on
the
white
horse
be
napoleon
forrester
thought
every
engineering
project
need
a
dictator
which
be
not
the
way
our
manufacturing
men
like
to
work
his
constant
criticism
make
them
angry
and
stubborn
and
i
be
worried
he
d
shift
sage
somewhere
else
i
work
harder
to
win
that
contract
than
i
work
for
any
other
sale
in
my
life
i
be
constantly
make
trip
up
to
mit
forrester
hem
and
haw
but
i
finally
told
him
that
if
he
promise
me
the
production
assignment
i
would
build
him
a
factory
without
wait
for
a
contract
give
me
your
handshake
and
we
ll
start
on
the
plant
this
week
i
say
i
knew
he
be
afraid
that
he
might
have
to
wait
a
long
time
for
the
paperwork
from
the
air
force
so
he
told
me
to
go
ahead
within
a
couple
of
year
we
have
thousand
of
people
work
on
sage
and
those
big
q
s
be
in
operation
all
over
the
continent
we
built
forty
eight
in
all
you
d
sometimes
see
a
sage
center
if
you
be
drive
in
a
remote
place
they
be
huge
windowless
concrete
building
each
cover
an
entire
acre
and
housing
two
machine
the
control
room
in
these
place
be
a
big
room
lit
with
an
eerie
blue
light
the
watch
commander
would
sit
in
front
of
a
giant
map
of
his
entire
area
on
that
board
the
computer
would
plot
in
yellow
the
movement
of
all
the
airplane
in
the
sky
along
with
symbol
to
show
whether
they
be
friend
or
foe
if
there
be
an
attacker
the
commander
simply
have
to
point
to
its
blip
with
a
device
call
a
light
gun
and
sage
would
automatically
radio
information
about
its
position
to
interceptor
plane
and
antiaircraft
battery
the
system
even
have
the
reliability
that
the
air
force
want
we
d
solve
that
problem
by
have
the
q
s
work
in
tandem
take
turn
one
machine
would
juggle
the
radar
while
its
twin
be
be
service
or
stand
by
by
that
method
the
average
sage
center
be
able
to
stay
on
alert
over
percent
of
the
time
sage
be
celebrate
as
one
of
the
great
technical
achievement
of
its
day
but
although
the
system
work
fine
the
arm
race
make
it
obsolete
before
it
be
even
finish
it
could
guard
against
attack
by
bomber
but
not
missile
so
when
the
russian
launch
sputnik
in
sage
become
pas
i
remember
i
be
sit
in
a
hotel
din
room
in
bremen
when
word
of
sputnik
come
a
waiter
who
knew
i
be
american
walk
up
and
say
where
be
your
sputnik
where
be
your
sputnik
we
get
scar
all
over
again
because
we
d
left
ourselves
vulnerable
to
an
attack
from
space
but
in
fairness
to
jay
forrester
and
all
the
military
men
who
decide
to
build
sage
none
of
us
ever
question
its
suitability
at
the
time
it
be
design
and
it
give
ibm
the
giant
boost
i
be
after
until
the
late
s
sage
account
for
almost
half
our
total
computer
sale
we
make
very
little
money
on
the
project
in
keep
with
the
policy
against
war
profiteer
laid
down
by
dad
but
it
enable
us
to
build
highly
automate
factory
ahead
of
anybody
else
and
to
train
thousand
of
new
worker
in
electronics
even
though
ibm
be
supply
a
large
proportion
of
the
defense
department
s
electronic
brain
i
be
never
much
of
a
cold
warrior
like
most
thing
conceive
in
a
panic
the
air
defense
system
only
seem
to
make
sense
we
built
it
because
the
russian
have
the
bomb
and
we
be
afraid
they
might
fly
over
here
and
destroy
new
york
it
amazes
me
that
nobody
ever
thought
to
ask
why
they
d
want
to
do
that
our
state
department
probably
could
have
told
us
that
the
russian
would
never
attack
because
they
knew
we
could
retaliate
against
their
city
and
in
reality
they
didn
t
have
any
airplane
that
could
make
the
flight
so
sage
be
a
costly
fantasy
the
sdi
of
its
day
before
long
we
found
ourselves
vastly
overarmed
face
with
the
danger
of
mutual
annihilation
but
at
that
point
the
country
be
in
a
terrible
state
of
paranoia
because
of
the
red
scare
senator
joe
mccarthy
be
hold
hearing
and
claim
to
find
communist
in
every
crack
in
the
wall
there
be
a
moment
when
i
truly
thought
ibm
be
go
to
lose
its
shot
at
defense
work
because
of
the
kind
of
window
blind
i
have
in
my
office
window
blind
in
those
day
be
almost
all
horizontal
ordinary
venetian
blind
but
vertical
blind
have
just
be
developed
and
some
have
be
order
for
me
an
ibm
engineer
be
in
my
office
one
day
for
a
meeting
and
he
be
interested
in
get
the
same
kind
of
blind
for
his
office
so
he
drew
a
little
diagram
of
how
they
be
attach
on
axle
to
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
he
put
that
little
piece
of
paper
in
his
shirt
pocket
and
forgot
about
it
a
few
day
later
the
man
who
do
the
engineer
s
laundry
be
check
the
shirt
before
put
it
in
the
washer
and
he
found
that
little
slip
of
paper
just
a
diagram
with
no
explanation
mccarthy
have
so
spook
this
country
that
everybody
thought
everybody
else
be
a
red
so
the
laundry
man
sent
the
paper
to
mccarthy
and
pretty
soon
senate
investigator
come
and
say
to
the
engineer
we
ve
identify
this
as
the
plan
for
a
radar
antenna
and
we
want
to
hear
about
it
we
want
to
be
perfectly
fair
but
we
know
it
be
a
radar
antenna
and
the
shirt
it
be
found
in
belongs
to
you
the
guy
say
oh
for
chrissake
those
be
the
blind
in
watson
s
office
so
they
ask
to
see
me
when
they
come
to
my
office
they
explain
what
the
engineer
have
told
them
and
i
say
well
those
blind
be
right
here
i
show
them
how
the
blind
work
they
look
them
over
very
carefully
and
then
left
i
thought
that
i
have
contain
it
but
i
wasn
t
sure
and
i
be
scar
we
be
work
on
sage
and
it
would
have
be
a
hell
of
a
way
to
lose
our
security
clearance
the
mccarthy
year
be
a
formative
period
for
me
i
be
only
begin
to
run
the
business
and
i
have
no
idea
how
forcefully
i
ought
to
speak
out
my
reaction
to
mccarthy
be
like
that
of
many
other
concerned
citizen
at
the
begin
i
felt
it
be
possible
that
he
might
be
onto
something
but
gradually
this
give
way
to
outrage
and
dismay
at
his
bullying
and
lie
at
one
point
i
take
a
week
off
to
go
skiing
in
switzerland
and
sat
in
my
bedroom
reading
a
story
in
the
international
herald
tribune
about
accusation
mccarthy
be
make
against
the
top
people
in
government
i
thought
to
myself
how
can
we
let
him
go
on
like
this
he
be
make
the
united
state
of
america
look
like
salem
of
the
witch
trial
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
felt
embarrass
for
my
country
and
i
told
this
to
dad
when
i
get
back
to
new
york
he
share
my
disgust
for
mccarthy
but
counsel
restraint
these
thing
usually
work
themselves
out
he
say
it
be
both
a
great
strength
and
great
weakness
of
dad
s
that
his
optimism
prevent
him
from
make
negative
public
statement
about
anything
in
this
case
i
wasn
t
sure
he
be
right
he
have
set
a
powerful
example
for
me
year
before
by
take
an
early
vocal
stand
in
favor
of
roosevelt
and
the
new
deal
shortly
after
that
i
be
invite
to
a
lunch
at
lehman
brother
a
wall
street
investment
bank
that
in
those
day
be
all
powerful
there
be
some
very
important
men
present
and
we
all
sat
around
a
large
round
table
bobby
lehman
the
head
of
the
firm
talk
about
mccarthy
he
say
the
man
be
uncouth
and
i
don
t
like
his
approach
but
none
of
us
can
argue
with
the
idea
of
root
communism
out
of
our
government
then
he
ask
me
what
my
view
be
i
say
i
don
t
happen
to
agree
with
senator
mccarthy
i
think
he
be
do
more
harm
than
good
i
don
t
believe
that
the
high
council
of
our
government
be
riddle
with
communist
i
think
it
s
undesirable
that
a
few
army
clerk
be
communist
but
it
s
not
terribly
important
it
be
a
very
conservative
crowd
of
the
twenty
odd
people
present
i
be
the
only
one
who
take
that
position
that
didn
t
bother
me
what
bother
me
be
that
the
follow
week
i
get
letter
from
several
people
who
have
be
there
and
they
all
have
a
similar
message
i
didn
t
want
to
commit
myself
in
public
but
i
certainly
agree
with
everything
you
say
the
businessman
whose
response
to
mccarthy
i
admire
most
be
walter
h
wheeler
jr
he
be
the
head
of
pitney
bowes
a
very
successful
manufacturing
company
in
connecticut
tiny
wheeler
be
well
over
six
foot
tall
and
weigh
about
pound
he
be
really
irate
over
a
two
million
dollar
lawsuit
mccarthy
file
against
senator
william
benton
of
connecticut
benton
have
give
a
speech
call
mccarthy
a
liar
and
say
his
witch
hunt
tactic
be
tear
america
apart
mccarthy
sue
him
for
libel
and
slander
and
help
defeat
benton
when
he
try
to
get
reelect
then
mccarthy
withdrew
the
complaint
just
before
the
case
go
to
court
he
say
his
lawyer
have
advise
him
he
could
not
prove
damage
because
they
could
find
no
one
who
believe
mr
benton
s
statement
tiny
wheeler
have
no
connection
to
that
case
but
he
sent
mccarthy
a
telegram
that
say
your
lawyer
could
not
have
look
very
hard
i
would
be
glad
to
testify
for
you
that
i
believe
what
senator
benton
have
say
about
you
and
be
sure
there
be
many
million
of
others
in
this
country
who
would
be
happy
to
do
likewise
walter
h
wheeler
pitney
bowes
incorporate
wheeler
give
copy
of
the
telegram
to
the
newspaper
and
it
appear
in
the
new
york
time
the
follow
morning
it
be
one
of
the
most
courageous
move
i
ever
saw
a
businessman
make
which
sound
peculiar
today
but
for
that
brief
period
mccarthy
s
power
be
awesome
i
call
wheeler
up
go
and
visit
him
and
from
then
on
walter
wheeler
be
one
of
my
business
hero
i
saw
a
graphic
illustration
of
how
not
to
behave
when
i
go
to
washington
to
watch
army
secretary
bob
stevens
testify
in
the
hearing
mccarthy
held
on
the
army
stevens
be
a
friend
of
dad
s
and
have
be
head
of
the
great
textile
firm
j
p
stevens
which
his
family
own
he
be
no
match
for
mccarthy
stevens
be
try
to
play
the
marquis
of
queensberry
rule
with
mccarthy
try
to
treat
him
like
a
senator
he
say
i
certainly
want
to
help
you
sir
and
the
more
he
cooperate
the
more
trouble
he
get
into
i
thought
he
must
have
go
to
too
many
boarding
school
he
s
not
get
down
in
the
gutter
with
this
guy
the
only
way
to
fight
a
guttersnipe
be
in
the
gutter
most
of
the
people
i
knew
be
eat
and
breathing
those
army
hearing
the
final
session
of
which
be
on
tv
it
be
the
first
time
tv
played
a
role
in
a
great
national
debate
stevens
s
lawyer
a
brilliant
strategist
hire
a
boston
attorney
name
joseph
nye
welch
to
represent
the
army
he
be
the
man
who
say
to
mccarthy
with
million
of
people
watch
have
you
no
sense
of
decency
sir
at
long
last
that
one
sentence
be
the
begin
of
mccarthy
s
downfall
by
then
i
d
decide
that
mccarthy
be
a
symptom
of
a
real
weakness
in
america
that
i
want
to
tackle
publicly
even
if
it
meant
take
a
negative
position
that
would
be
unlike
dad
i
be
ask
to
speak
later
that
year
in
fort
wayne
indiana
to
a
large
gathering
of
salesman
from
various
industry
my
host
be
ernie
gallmeyer
head
of
the
wayne
pump
company
ernie
knew
me
from
the
american
society
of
sale
executive
and
thought
of
me
as
a
bright
young
businessman
that
be
a
very
conservative
area
of
america
even
today
and
back
then
it
be
the
heart
of
mccarthy
country
i
thought
it
be
an
ideal
forum
for
an
anti
mccarthy
speech
many
of
you
may
not
agree
with
me
that
s
good
i
say
the
point
i
make
be
that
in
an
atmosphere
of
open
discussion
mccarthy
would
never
have
gotten
as
far
as
he
have
i
told
them
that
as
american
salesman
who
make
their
living
by
talk
they
have
a
patriotic
obligation
to
promote
the
thoughtful
debate
of
public
issue
we
as
salesman
have
an
add
duty
beyond
sell
our
product
we
ought
to
put
our
salesmanship
behind
the
american
way
of
life
and
not
let
evil
or
unjustified
suspicion
frighten
american
we
have
the
duty
of
help
to
form
an
honest
fair
mind
public
opinion
in
this
country
uncontrolled
suspicion
be
like
a
plague
it
would
wreck
america
so
if
this
uncontrolled
suspicion
start
roll
around
america
again
we
must
fight
it
that
will
be
a
time
that
call
for
cool
head
and
persuasive
salesmanship
when
i
finish
there
be
modest
applause
very
modest
even
though
many
prominent
people
be
critical
of
mccarthy
by
this
time
and
even
though
my
speech
have
be
relatively
mild
ernie
gallmeyer
be
in
shock
and
try
to
get
me
out
of
the
hall
before
anybody
could
talk
to
me
to
judge
from
ernie
s
reaction
what
i
say
be
so
distasteful
to
the
people
in
fort
wayne
that
he
felt
his
reputation
have
be
damage
unfortunately
this
be
before
the
day
of
fly
home
after
a
meeting
so
i
have
to
spend
an
awkward
night
at
his
house
i
guess
i
have
thought
i
could
win
all
of
them
over
but
the
feel
of
be
treat
like
an
outsider
be
so
disturb
to
me
that
i
say
to
olive
when
i
get
home
it
be
as
though
i
have
gotten
a
frightful
disease
later
i
talk
to
my
father
about
it
he
say
tom
i
be
always
an
outsider
too
because
i
spoke
for
the
poor
and
high
tax
and
well
social
program
he
read
my
speech
and
didn
t
object
in
the
least
these
be
thing
that
need
to
be
brought
out
i
m
glad
you
re
say
them
and
i
m
glad
to
see
you
take
public
position
even
though
they
re
minority
position
after
a
while
i
stop
feel
embarrass
when
other
businessmen
dismiss
me
as
a
liberal
nut
i
felt
as
dad
do
the
country
have
give
him
an
awful
lot
and
it
be
in
the
process
of
give
me
an
awful
lot
i
have
a
very
profitable
company
i
be
young
and
vigorous
and
willing
to
say
what
i
believe
be
able
to
make
liberal
speech
be
a
luxury
for
a
businessman
the
whole
picture
would
have
be
different
if
ibm
s
profit
margin
have
be
low
people
wouldn
t
have
be
as
interested
in
have
me
speak
and
i
would
never
have
be
so
outspoken
when
i
make
a
public
appearance
i
always
have
the
huge
ibm
engine
behind
me
blowing
a
whistle
that
signal
look
at
this
company
this
kid
be
run
it
don
t
take
him
lightly
because
he
know
what
he
s
do
if
i
d
be
president
of
a
coal
company
instead
make
say
six
percent
a
year
in
profit
instead
of
percent
i
could
never
have
gotten
public
attention
for
my
view
in
my
picture
be
on
the
cover
of
time
dad
have
never
be
honor
that
way
and
i
felt
both
proud
and
embarrass
i
be
run
ibm
practically
on
my
own
now
but
obviously
a
lot
of
the
credit
belong
to
him
the
time
story
be
a
perfect
example
of
that
the
magazine
have
a
reporter
name
virginia
bennett
assign
to
find
out
about
automation
in
america
in
those
day
remington
rand
have
its
headquarters
near
ours
in
manhattan
and
she
go
to
interview
them
because
of
the
univac
fortunately
for
us
they
weren
t
very
forthcoming
that
day
and
miss
bennett
didn
t
get
the
interview
she
need
she
be
walk
back
to
her
office
somewhat
discourage
when
she
happen
to
pas
ibm
she
saw
the
defense
calculator
in
the
window
and
must
have
thought
these
people
be
in
the
computer
business
too
so
i
ll
stop
and
give
it
a
whirl
that
be
where
dad
have
his
effect
he
be
an
absolute
stickler
on
how
the
public
should
be
greet
at
the
door
and
we
always
have
skilled
receptionist
in
the
lobby
dad
chose
these
woman
himself
he
would
talk
to
them
about
the
importance
of
relate
well
to
the
public
and
tell
them
that
if
a
stranger
look
important
he
or
she
should
be
give
vip
treatment
one
of
these
experienced
receptionist
be
on
duty
when
miss
bennett
walk
in
and
say
she
be
a
reporter
from
time
with
an
idea
for
a
story
the
receptionist
knew
enough
to
say
well
the
head
of
this
company
be
mr
watson
he
isn
t
in
the
building
today
but
his
son
tom
be
the
president
and
you
certainly
can
see
him
ten
minute
later
virginia
bennett
be
sit
in
my
office
hearing
about
ibm
s
electronic
marvel
the
editor
at
time
have
a
theory
that
there
be
a
second
industrial
revolution
underway
because
of
electronics
and
they
like
the
way
ibm
fit
this
theme
before
long
they
have
reporter
interview
all
our
top
people
they
sent
a
man
to
see
dad
on
vacation
in
palm
beach
and
another
correspondent
come
to
one
of
our
sale
convention
in
chicago
i
spent
three
day
there
in
a
hotel
room
with
him
tell
him
my
life
story
then
they
take
picture
of
our
computer
our
factory
and
my
family
when
it
come
out
the
cover
show
a
portrait
of
me
and
behind
my
back

its

it
be
the
best
publicity
any

ever
hope
for
for
million
of
reader
time
equate
our
product
with
the
advance
of
civilization
the
prospect
for
mankind
be
truly
dazzle
the
story
say
automation
of
industry
will
mean
new
reach
of
leisure
new
wealth
new
dignity
for
the
labor
man
while
dad
kept
himself
pretty
far
remove
from
the
computer
project
leave
them
to
williams
and
me
this
be
the
message
he
have
always
be
interested
in
put
across
decade
before
computer
even
exist
he
have
see
that
potential
in
punch
card
machine
the
article
include
a
small
picture
of
dad
and
told
how
he
have
built
ibm
still
i
knew
i
d
feel
slight
if
i
be
in
his
shoe
and
it
be
my
son
get
top
billing
that
put
a
damper
on
my
excitement
when
i
found
out
i
be
probably
go
to
be
on
the
cover
i
felt
oblige
to
try
to
cushion
the
blow
to
dad
s
ego
by
send
a
letter
to
him
and
mother
whatever
they
say
about
me
be
a
reflection
on
you
both
if
it
s
favorable
i
write
there
would
be
no
ibm
for
me
to
be
president
of
have
it
not
be
for
your
initiative
and
courage
dad
this
i
know
and
this
i
have
told
time
while
i
hope
i
have
in
me
what
it
take
to
do
a
good
job
now
i
know
i
don
t
have
what
you
have
in
building
the
company
it
be
a
sincere
but
clumsy
attempt
to
reassure
him
though
i
doubt
it
make
him
feel
any
less
upstaged
he
didn
t
talk
to
me
about
the
article
at
all
he
never
say
great
go
and
i
never
brought
it
up
by
the
mid
s
computer
be
become
a
magic
word
as
popular
as
vitamin
top
executive
rightly
believe
that
the
company
of
the
future
be
go
to
be
computer
run
board
chairman
would
say
we
ve
get
to
get
a
computer
everybody
want
one
even
though
precisely
how
to
use
the
machine
be
still
a
mystery
it
become
the
conventional
wisdom
that
management
ran
a
big
risk
by
wait
to
computerize
than
by
take
the
plunge
if
remington
rand
have
put
their
money
and
heart
behind
the
univac
right
at
the
start
maybe
they
d
have
be
in
time
magazine
instead
of
us
but
nobody
at
the
top
of
the
company
have
a
vision
of
what
computer
might
mean
jim
rand
be
more
of
a
conglomerateur
while
dad
be
say
shoemaker
stick
to
your
last
rand
s
company
be
sell
everything
include
office

even
let
eckert
and
mauchly
use
his
punch
card
salesman
to
market
computer
he
say
it
would
cost
too
much
instead
thing
be
set
up
so
that
if
a
new
univac
displace
remington
rand
punch
card
equipment
the
punch
card
salesman
lose
commission
at
ibm
there
be
never
any
question
we
put
the
whole
weight
of
our
sale
force
behind
our
computer
as
soon
as
they
be
announce
at
first
our
salesman
knew
almost
nothing
about
them
of
course
so
we
make
sure
that
senior
executive
and
the
engineer
who
do
know
be
available
to
help
them
sell
month
before
the
machine
be
ready
for
delivery
we
hire
dozen
of
graduate
mathematician
and
physicist
and
engineer
to
help
customer
decide
how
they
might
use
the
computer
when
the
machine
arrive
to
spread
knowledge
of
the
new
field
we
held
seminar
in
poughkeepsie
for
our
customer
and
salesman
both
in
the
history
of
ibm
technological
innovation
often
wasn
t
the
thing
that
make
us
successful
unhappily
there
be
many
time
when
we
come
in
second
but
technology
turn
out
to
be
less
important
than
sale
and
distribution
method
start
with
univac
we
consistently
outsold
people
who
have
well
technology
because
we
knew
how
to
put
the
story
before
the
customer
how
to
install
the
machine
successfully
and
how
to
hang
on
to
customer
once
we
have
them
the
secret
of
our
sale
approach
be
the
same
thing
that
make
dad
so
successful
in

system
knowledge
that
be
where
ibm

its

enough
attention
to
it
not
even
the
people
at
remington

who
should
have

well
because
they

ahead
of

up
enough

would
scold
bring
out
the
on
time
meant
that
all
of
ibm
s
department
product
planning
engineering
manufacturing
sale
have
to
cooperate
i
didn
t
assume
this
would
happen
automatically
the
project
be
complicate
and
there
be
a
lot
of
punch
card
men
who
would
be
just
as
happy
to
see
computer
disappear
we
could
easily
trip
ourselves
up
and
i
decide
we
need
somebody
in
charge
of
make
sure
that
didn
t
happen
i
chose
vin
learson
who
have
emerge
as
one
of
ibm
s
best
operating
executive
he
be
six
foot
six
inch
tall
and
his
mere
presence
in
a
room
be
enough
to
get
people
s
attention
the
job
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
assignment
in
ibm
history
by
summer
our
engineer
realize
to
their
horror
that
the
be
probably
not
the
great
univac
beater
we
thought
one
big
problem
be
the
machine
s
memory
the
type
of
storage
circuitry
we
be
use
work
faster
than
the
circuitry
in
the
univac
but
it
also
forgot
bit
of
data
more
often
we
could
make
the
perform
reliably
enough
that
deliver
it
to
customer
wouldn
t
hurt
ibm
s
reputation
but
only
by
provide
laboratory
train
team
of
specialist
to
babysit
the
machine
our
engineer
and
production
manager
weren
t
sure
how
to
proceed
learson
turn
this
quandary
into
a
triumph
his
first
move
be
to
order
a
crash
redesign
of
the
machine
he
take
what
we
d
learn
work
for
the
air
force
on
sage
and
use
it
to
skip
a
grade
so
to
speak
in
computer
development
the
mit
engineer
on
sage
have
achieve
a
historic
breakthrough
in
memory
technology
that
involve
store
data
on
array
of
tiny
doughnut
shape
magnet
call
core
core
memory
be
ultra
reliable
and
our
engineer
have
be
planning
to
incorporate
it
in
the
next
generation
of
ibm
s
computer
about
three
year
down
the
road
but
vin
told
them
to
jump
on
it
right
away
he
drove
the
engineer
at
such
a
ferocious
pace
that
in
less
than
six
month
we
d
revamped
our
entire
computer
line
with
core
memory
meanwhile
vin
decide
that
we
d
go
ahead
and
manufacture
the
relatively
unreliable
s
but
just
for
a
year
as
a
stopgap
as
soon
as
the
newer
design
could
be
produce
we
d
switch
our
customer
to
those
and
either
upgrade
or
replace
the
old
machine
in
a
little
over
a
year
we
start
deliver
those
redesign
computer
they
make
the
univac
obsolete
and
we
soon
left
remington
rand
in
the
dust
by
the
time
the
presidential
election
roll
around
in
we
have
eighty
seven
machine
in
operation
and
one
hundred
ninety
on
order
against
forty

in
operation
and
forty
on

for
all

maker
eisenhower

stevenson
again
but
this
time
the
computer
you
saw
on
tv

ibm
machine
whenever
we
have
superior
technology
to
complement
our
system
knowledge
our
business
skyrocket
that
happen
when
we
start
deliver
a
small
computer
call
the
in
it
be
far
less
powerful
than
the
defense
calculator
but
much
cheaper
competitor
like
underwood
typewriter
and
national
cash
register
be
race
to
build
small
computer
that
could
be
use
by
ordinary
business
but
the
outperform
them
all
over
the
next
several
year
it
enable
us
to
bring
thousand
of
punch
card
customer
into
the
computer
age
the
rent
for
about
four
thousand
dollar
a
month
and
be
the
perfect
choice
for
company
eager
to
try
compute
because
we
design
it
to
work
along
with
ordinary
punch
card
equipment
yet
it
could
do
accounting
job
that
be
beyond
punch
card
for
example
life

a

typically
this

clerk
would
look
up
the
rate
in
table
and
work
out
the
amount
due
on
add
machine
but
with
the
the
company
could
load
their
actuarial
table
into
its
memory
and
the
computer
do
the
work
its
ability
to
handle
these
bread
and
butter
application
make
the
hot
while
our
giant
million

series
machine
get
the
publicity
the
become
compute
s
model
t
we
played
a
large
role
in
create
new
profession
such
as
program
and
system
engineering
as
it
finally
become
obvious
that
we
be
give
birth
to
a
whole
new
industry
we
discover
that
the
world
wasn
t
entirely
ready
for
our
machine
it
be
as
though
we
have
the
airplane
but
no
one
to
fly
them
and
no
place
to
land
our
customer
often
complain
that
the
most
difficult
thing
about
have
a
computer
be
hire
somebody
who
could
run
it
they
d
ask
for
help
we
couldn
t
provide
all
those
technician
ourselves
and
there
be
not
a
single
university
with
a
computer
curriculum
sometimes
we
even
found
ourselves
in
a
position
where
we
have
to
hold
back
from
take
a
customer
s
order
so
i
go
up
to
mit
in
and
urge
them
to
start
training
computer
scientist
we
make
a
gift
of
a
large
computer
and
the
money
to
run
it
and
they
share
that
machine
with
ten
other
school
in
the
northeast
for
the
we
adapt
a
very
aggressive
college
discount
program
that
exist
for
our
punch
card
machine
you
could
get
percent
off
for
set
up
a
course
in
either
business
data
processing
or
scientific
compute
and
percent
off
for
set
up

in
both
i
put
these
education
policy
near
the
top
of
the
list
of
ibm
s
key
move
because
within
five
year
there
be
a
whole
new
generation
of
computer
scientist
who
make
it
possible
for
the
market
to
boom
wherever
i
travel
during
those
year
i
try
to
recruit
top
people
for
ibm
s
research
and
development
side
the
engineer
who
be
hardest
to
attract
be
those
graduate
from
stanford
and
caltech
and
the
university
of
california
the
smart
one
never
want
to
leave
the
west
coast
sun
to
come
east
so
very
early
on
we
decide
to
put
a
laboratory
out
in
san
jose
and
i
bought
a
building
that
have
be
intend
for
a
supermarket
the
man
we
sent
to
manage
the
new
lab
be
reynold
johnson
one
of
dad
s
self
taught
inventor
from
endicott
he
have
start
out
as
a
high
school
teacher
in
minnesota
and
he
come
to
ibm
in
the
s
propose
a
machine
that
could
automatically
read
and
grade
multiple
choice
test
for
school
some
executive
told
him
the
idea
be
impractical
but
dad
overrule
them
put
johnson
on
the
payroll
and
let
him
build
his
machine
ibm
make
several
million
dollar
on
test
score
equipment
and
the
method
be
still
use
on
college
admission
test
today
johnson
be
delighted
at
the
thought
of
escape
from
the
rivalry
and
pressure
of
endicott
and
direct
his
own
lab
he
move
to
california
hire
three
dozen
young
engineer
and
in
less
than
three
year
present
ibm
with
an
invention
that
be
truly
spectacular
the
computer
disk
it
store
data
in
the
form
of
tiny
magnetize
spot
on
its
surface
and
one
problem
johnson
face
be
how
to
lay
down
a
coat
on
the
disk
that
be
uniform
enough
to
permit
this
i
remember
the
day
i
saw
him
demonstrate
his
solution
he
stood
in
front
of
a
spin
aluminum
disk
with
some
magnetic
coat
in
a
paper
cup
and
begin
pour
it
slowly
like
a
milkshake
onto
the
disk
s
center
when
the
stuff
spread
out
to
near
the
edge
he
stop
pour
and
he
have
a
magnetic
disk
the
machine
he
invent
which
we
call
the
ramac
incorporate
fifty
of
those
disk
stack
like
record
in
a
jukebox
except
that
they
all
be
spin
at
once
a
little
arm
would
move
in
and
out
among
the
disk
extend
a
record
head
over
the
disk
surface
to
pick
up
the
data
that
be
need
the
descendant
of
rey
johnson
s
disk
be
the
main
data
storage
device
in
virtually
every
computer
system
today
from
very
large
mainframe
down
to
ordinary
pc
and
they
revolutionize
the
computer
s
usefulness
computer
tape
like
those
use
with
the
defense
calculator
don
t
work
well
in
application
where
a
computer
have
to
look
up
a
particular
piece
of
information
to
check
a
customer
s
bank
balance
say
or
tell
how
many
seat
be
still
available
on
a
particular
airline
flight
without
rey
johnson
s
disk
those
application
never
would
have
be
practical
to
see
why
you
only
need
to
imagine
a
music
lover
who
have
a
collection
of
both
record
and
tape
cassette
if
he
want
to
play
a
favorite
song
on
a
tape
he
have
to
wait
while
the
tape
deck
fast
forward
to
the
proper
spot
but
with
a
record
he
can
move
the
phonograph
needle
directly
to
the
right
track
and
hear
the
music
instantly
a
computer
equip
with
a
disk
home
in
on
data
in
much
the
same
way
and
the
ramac
make
it
possible
to
retrieve
information
two
hundred
time
as
fast
as
with
magnetic
tape
while
we
be
proud
of
our
computer
proud
of
our
disk
and
proud
of
our
tape
drive
i
didn
t
fool
myself
into
think
that
ibm
have
much
genuine
scientific
prowess
we
be
a
maker
of
electromechanical
equipment
try
to
go
into
a
very
sophisticated
field
with
almost
no
background
because
of
this
i
kept
work
to
increase
the
flow
of
technical
information
into
ibm
when
we
first
start
building
computer
for
example
we
arrange
for
john
von
neumann
the
eminent
princeton
university
computer
theorist
to
give
seminar
to
our
men
at
poughkeepsie
von
neumann
be
one
of
the
atom
bomb
pioneer
and
he
practically
define
the
modern
notion
of
software
i
didn
t
understand
his
work
but
i
knew
how
important
he
be
from
then
on
we
kept
a
steady
stream
of
expert
come
in
and
we
frequently
sent
our
engineer
out
to
university
course
as
well
but
it
be
soon
obvious
that
this
wasn
t
enough
and
we
begin
search
for
a
senior
scientist
to
come
and
organize
a
program
of
pure
research
within
ibm
wally
mcdowell
our
chief
of
engineering
spent
the
well
part
of
scour
the
country
for
candidate
i
take
about
a
month
and
go
around
interview
them
even
though
i
be
somewhat
in
the
dark
because
i
didn
t
know
the
scientific
community
that
well
finally
i
settle
on
a
candidate
who
have
do
an
impressive
job
at
building
up
the
school
of
engineering
at
a
major
university
but
before
i
present
my
choice
to
ibm
s
board
i
attend
a
meeting
at
mit
and
mention
his
name
in
a
chat
with
jim
killian
mit
s
president
killian
look
horrify
he
say
oh
no
he
wouldn
t
be
appropriate
at
all
for
that
job
why
not
i
ask
i
felt
my
ear
burning
because
i
have
apparently
do
something
stupid
and
didn
t
know
what
it
be
killian
be
evasive
about
his
reason
so
finally
i
say
look
we
want
a
distinguish
scientist
until
a
minute
ago
i
thought
i
d
found
one
but
if
you
know
of
someone
well
than
this
fellow
tell
me
what
i
didn
t
understand
then
and
killian
do
be
that
american
science
be
dominate
by
a
coterie
of
men
who
have
work
together
during
the
war
these
be
people
like
leo
szilard
and
the
team
that
have
built
the
atom
bomb
and
isidor
rabi
and
the
team
that
pioneer
radar
the
qualification
of
the
man
i
d
found
be
superb
killian
say
but
that
make
no
difference
unless
i
hire
someone
from
this
circle
ibm
might
spend
large
sum
and
still
end
up
with
a
lab
that
be
merely
second
rate
because
we
d
have
trouble
attract
other
top
people
so
who
should
i
call
i
ask
and
killian
say
promptly
emanuel
piore
he
be
one
of
them
i
d
never
heard
of
him
but
killian
fill
me
in
until
the
year
before
piore
have
be
chief
scientist
at
the
office
of
naval
research
and
he
have
played
a
major
role
in

now
he
d
left
the
government
and
be
work
for
a
new
york
defense
contractor
i
tracked
piore
down
that
night
by
phone
and
go
to
see
him
the
next
day
he
seem
familiar
and
it
turn
out
that
his
uncle
be
michael
romanoff

self
proclaim
russian
prince
who
found
romanoff
s
restaurant
in
hollywood
the
prince

be
a
celebrity
during
my
nightclubbing
phase
manny
look
exactly
like
him
a
tweedy
man
with
bushy
eyebrow
shaggy
unkempt
hair
a
dark
complexion
and
a
perpetual
slouch
he
smoke
a
pipe
have
a
sort
of
mumble
demeanor
and
tend
not
to
look
you
square
in
the
eye
all
the
same
i
found
him
very
appeal
and
on
the
strength
of
killian
s
recommendation
i
hire
him
now
that
the
matter
be
settle
i
wonder
if
i
d
picked
the
right
guy
i
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
manny
s
odd
self
efface
manner
but
a
couple
of
month
later
i
take
him
to
zurich
to
introduce
him
at
the
laboratory
we
have
there
manny
be
mumble
at
the
dinner
they
give
us
and
a
swiss
scientist
who
be
pretty
arrogant
decide
he
must
be
a
pushover
so
he
criticize
him
in
a
nasty
tone
of
voice
for
not
set
sufficiently
precise
research
standard
and
goal
for
ibm
piore
come
back
at
him
like
a
lion
i
ll
take
that
and
i
ll
answer
it
he
say
and
give
a
detailed
five
point
response
then
he
say
be
there
any
facet
of
this
you
d
like
explain
far
i
come
here
tonight
to
make
sure
we
understand
each
other
i
thought
we
d
keep
thing
pleasant
but
i
m
willing
to
take
it
right
down
to
the
bare
knuckle
if
that
s
what
you
want
the
other
guy
didn
t
breathe
another
word
i
thought
i
ve
get
a
winner
here
killian
be
right
piore
give
a
jolt
to
some
of
our
product
development
engineer
as
well
they
be
like
sprinter
encounter
their
first
marathon
runner
and
be
amaze
to
see
ibm
start
funding
experiment
in
exotic
field
that
seem
unlikely
to
bear
fruit
for
decade
if
ever
like
superconductors
and
artificial
intelligence
what
the
engineer
thought
of
as
basic
research
piore
often
dismiss
as
mere
long
term
product
development
and
what
he
call
research
be
so
far
remove
from
what
the
engineer
be
do
that
they
saw
no
reason
for
it
at
all
at
piore
s
urge
we
double
the
percentage
of
our
revenue
devote
to
research
and
development
and
much
of
the
additional
spending
be
earmark
for
pure
science
with
all
this
creative
ferment
ibm
s
potential
seem
unlimited
as
long
as
we
avoid
horrible
mistake
a
feat
much
harder
than
i
first
assume
one
day
near
the
end
of
my
first
year
as
president
al
williams
come
into
my
office
with
a
very
long
face
al
be
treasurer
at
that
point
and
he
d
just
add
up
the
financial
result
for
boy
you
ve
get
a
problem
he
say
sale
that
year
be
up
by
percent
and
profit
be
barely
up
at
all
i
be
flabbergast
without
know
it
we
have
allow
our
cost
to
eat
up
the
profit
from
over
sixty
million
dollar
of
new
business
it
be
too
late
to
do
anything
about
it
the
money
about
seventeen
million
dollar
be
go
even
bad
be
the
way
this
have
happen
we
d
spent
more
than
we
expect
because
ibm
have
no
budget
williams
and
i
have
be
try
to
run
this
major
corporation
out
of
our
vest
pocket
the
way
dad
always
have
that
might
have
work
before
the
war
when
ibm
be
a
forty
million
dollar
company
but
by
then
we
be
almost
ten
time
that
large
that
night
al
and
i
stayed
late
figure
out
how
to
break
the
news
to
stockholder
without
hurt
the
price
of
the
stock
our
best
bet
we
decide
be
a
straightforward
explanation
of
how
the
fund
have
be
spent
on
activity
very
necessary
to
ibm
s
growth
such
as
develop
new
product
expand
the
engineering
force
and
hire
and
training
new
salesman
the
follow
morning
i
be
wait
for
dad
when
he
come
to
the
office
i
m
embarrass
to
have
to
tell
you
this
i
say
as
i
show
him
the
number
i
get
trap
by
a
lack
of
financial
control
it
be
no
surprise
to
dad
that
we
d
overspent
he
d
be
warn
us
all
along
but
he
be
let
us
run
thing
for
ourselves
and
we
d
thought
he
be
out
of
touch
with
the
scale
of
the
business
dad
become
calm
and
grave
as
he
sometimes
do
when
confront
with
a
major
problem
listen
to
the
public
statement
i
propose
and
say
simply
i
think
the
shareholder
will
accept
that
he
be
right
the
price
of
ibm
stock
held
steady
when
we
release
the
figure
all
the
same
i
walk
into
the
annual
meeting
that
year
fill
with
dread
any
minute
i
expect
a
stockholder
to
say
i
have
a
question
for
the
young
mr
watson
be
this
the
kind
of
performance
that
we
can
expect
from
you
as
president
luckily
nobody
ask
but
i
felt
shaken
as
i
have
a
few
time
after
do
something
stupid
in
an
airplane
and
survive
by
sheer
chance
generally
i
need
to
be
hit
on
the
head
only
once
to
learn
a
lesson
a
trait
i
ve
come
to
think
of
as
absolutely
essential
in
business
al
and
i
set
thing
up
so
that
we
would
never
be
surprised
again
we
put
budget
in
all
the
department
appoint
the
toughest
mind
guy
we
could
find
as
budget
director
and
have
him
report
to
me
from
then
on
i
always
knew
in
june
approximately
where
we
be
go
to
be
financially
on
december
in
spite
of
the
mistake
we
make
i
couldn
t
have
run
ibm
without
al
he
be
my
alter
ego
he
have
the
ability
to
be
analytical
while
i
be
intuitive
and
to
make
sure
everything
be
tighten
up
and
do
right
while
i
be
out
in
front
set
the
pace
for
the
business
without
him
my
success
would
not
have
be
possible
and
without
me
he
wouldn
t
have
have
as
much
success
as
he
do
our
friendship
be
one
of
the
few
i
have
at
ibm
that
extend
outside
of
business
hour
i
would
seek
him
out
just
for
the
pleasure
of
his
company
and
olive
love
him
too
he
and
his
wife
pat
want
to
learn
to
sail
so
olive
and
i
go
down
to
their
house
once
a
month
for
twelve
month
and
taught
them
the
basic
one
visit
we
work
on
chart
how
to
plot
course
with
all
the
variation
and
deviation
another
day
i
tie
the
basic
knot
tacked
them
onto
a
board
and
take
it
to
him
i
make
diagram
of
how
a
boat
work
in
the
wind
how
the
force
of
wind
and
drag
and
momentum
act
on
the
hull
the
funny
thing
about
al
be
that
he
be
terribly
modest
and
didn
t
like
to
promote
himself
and
yet
if
i
give
him
an
opportunity
he
always
take
it
i
introduce
him
to
the
business
community
by
nominate
him
as
treasurer
of
the
new
york
boy
scout
from
there
he
be
invite
to
join
the
board
of
a
small
bank
and
eventually
he
end
up
a
director
of
the
first
national
city
bank
and
mobil
and
general
motor
i
look
after
his
career
within
ibm
as
well
tell
him
he
could
never
get
promote
out
of
the
financial
department
until
he
d
train
people
to
take
his
place
you
ve
get
nothing
but
clerk
in
there
i
say
that
be
overstate
it
because
al
have
two
excellent
men
barney
wiegard
and
herb
hansford
who
be
the
cornerstone
of
the
finance
department
but
have
to
do
practically
everything
themselves
before
i
knew
it
al
have
punch
card
shoot
all
over
and
have
identify
everyone
at
ibm
across
the
country
who
have
be
to
business
school
he
brought
the
top
young
men
to
new
york
and
within
a
year
not
only
have
he
gotten
the
finance
department
to
run
itself
but
in
the
process
he
d
single
out
some
real
leader
include
dick
bullen
who
emerge
as
the
best
organizational
architect
ibm
ever
have
and
a
future
chairman
frank
cary
those
be
confuse
year
at
ibm
even
if
dad
have
be
ten
year
young
and
kept
control
of
the
operation
himself
he
couldn
t
have
make
his
one
man
style
of
management
work
for
very
much
longer
important
problem
be
take
too
long
to
filter
through
to
the
top
and
we
have
unmade
decision
pile
up
in
every
corner
with
notable
exception
like
learson
most
ibm
executive
be
so
use
to
dance
at
the
end
of
dad
s
string
that
they
didn
t
dare
think
for
themselves
in
spite
of
our
much
publicize
company
motto
just
before
i
become
president
i
saw
a
secret
project
with
the
xerox
corporation
ruin
because
of
this
the
idea
be
to
couple
their
technology
with
our
tabulate
machine
for
printing
at
high
speed
it
be
a
modest
project
but
it
interested
me
because
i
thought
it
might
lead
to
an
alliance
between
xerox
and
ibm
instead
their
engineer
and
ours
butt
head
and
by
the
time
i
heard
there
be
any
problem
the
project
have
collapse
that
s
what
be
madden
about
highly
centralize
power
in
a
grow
company
my
first
step
in
break
that
pattern
be
to
surround
myself
with
top
notch
people
so
that
not
every
decision
have
to
wait
for
the
bos
to
find
even
a
half
dozen
executive
who
be
qualify
i
have
to
dip
into
ibm
s
second
and
third
rank
that
show
how
big
a
vacuum
there
be
at
the
top
i
d
inherit
eight
vice
president
from
dad
but
apart
from
williams
and
lamotte
only
two
have
mind
of
their
own
and
both
of
those
be
manufacturing
specialist
who
be
indispensable
at
the
endicott
and
poughkeepsie
plant
so
al
and
i
set
up
an
inner
circle
with
men
like
birkenstock
who
by
now
be
in
charge
of
our
patent
department
mcdowell
our
chief
engineer
miller
who
ran
the
typewriter
business
jack
bricker
the
director
of
personnel
and
learson
i
be
able
to
push
enough
responsibility
onto
these
men
so
that
we
begin
to
make
great
stride
we
get
launch
in
the
computer
business
make
good
on
our
korean
war
commitment
and
expand
our
punch
card
sale
by
another
percent
without
have
ibm
disintegrate
but
during
the
year
i
be
busy
land
the
sage
contract
our
decision
make
process
bogged
down
again
i
still
have
fifteen
top
official
reporting
to
me
counting
the
old
guard
and
the
new
men
i
d
brought
up
and
i
be
shock
to
find
myself
make
people
cool
their
heel
outside
my
office
just
like
dad
give
the
pace
of
change
in
our
business
i
didn
t
think
i
could
afford
to
do
that
so
i
take
another
step
away
from
dad
s
vest
pocket
management
style
i
told
him
i
want
to
make
executive
vice
president
of
lamotte
and
williams
and
have
all
the
other
executive
report
to
them
lamotte
would
oversee
ibm
s
sale
and
r
and
d
while
williams
would
cover
manufacturing
and
finance
this
would
speed
up
my
work
because
the
only
problem
that
would
come
to
me
would
be
those
that
al
and
red
couldn
t
handle
themselves
i
d
picked
them
because
they
complement
each
other
al
be
the
best
of
the
new
guard
and
i
want
him
there
to
help
me
navigate
ibm
through
the
sweep
change
i
could
foresee
red
on
the
other
hand
be
almost
sixty
year
old
and
stood
for
continuity
in
the
business
when
it
come
to
motivate
and
manage
people
he
could
extract
enormous
amount
of
work
without
ever
seem
tough
like
an
unintimidating
version
of
dad
i
thought
of
him
almost
as
my
uncle
and
it
be
easy
to
take
criticism
from
him
than
from
anyone
else
the
idea
of
delegate
so
much
power
be
totally
antithetical
to
dad
s
personality
and
for
week
he
fought
my
plan
to
promote
williams
and
lamotte
once
we
d
be
through
all
the
rational
argument
he
finally
even
try
get
mother
involve
i
think
on
some
level
he
must
have
be
worried
that
i
be
throw
my
patrimony
away
i
be
at
his
house
one
weekend
and
with
mother
there
in
the
living
room
dad
start
attack
my
choice
of
men
it
be
pretty
easy
to
ignore
him
when
he
call
lamotte
careless
i
knew
red
irritated
dad
because
of
his
upper
class
background
and
because
he
didn
t
necessarily
jump
to
attention
when
dad
come
into
a
room
but
what
shock
me
be
the
way
he
go
after
williams
tell
me
point
blank
that
al
couldn
t
be
trust
watch
your
flank
he
say
darkly
everybody
be
for
you
until
they
see
an
opportunity
to
be
against
you
i
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
this
and
i
would
have
lash
out
but
mother
spoke
up
she
explain
in
her
neutral
way
that
dad
remember
lose
his
job
at
the
cash
register
company
through
the
treachery
of
mr
deed
her
eye
lock
on
mine
and
i
realize
she
be
try
to
remind
me
that
i
be
deal
with
an
eighty
year
old
man
all
the
anger
go
out
of
me
i
turn
back
to
my
father
and
say
dad
al
williams
be
my
best
friend
if
i
m
wrong
about
the
guy
then
i
deserve
to
lose
my
shirt
dad
piped
down
after
that
and
when
i
go
to
present
the
promotion
to
the
board
he
and
i
walk
into
the
meeting
together
ibm
s
growth
be
hard
even
for
me
to
comprehend
it
be
and
we
be
about
to
break
the
half
billion
dollar
mark
in
sale
the
bulk
of
our
business
come
from
punch
card
machine
and
computer
but
even
our
sideline
be
become
big
than
all
of
ibm
have
be
before
the
war
we
have
a
factory
complex
just
outside
endicott
make
bombsight
for
the
air
force
under
contract
carry
over
from
the
korean
war
we
have
our
electric
typewriter
business
we
have
a
set
of
plant
that
do
nothing
but
manufacture
hundred
of
million
of
punch
card
altogether
ibm
be
expand
at
close
to
percent
a
year
and
the
billion
dollar
mark
be
only
a
few
year
away
if
i
be
scar
when
i
first
become
president
i
be
doubly
scar
now
ibm
have
already
reach
a
size
at
which
i
felt
it
might
be
prudent
to
slow
to
a
more
sedate
rate
of
growth
that
i
be
sure
we
could
finance
and
manage
that
summer
i
ask
al
williams
to
clear
a
couple
of
day
on
his
calendar
so
that
we
could
sit
down
and
discus
the
company
s
future
he
agree
that
it
be
a
good
time
to
think
about
rein
in
ibm
the
problem
be
that
this
fail
to
take
the
computer
into
account
demand
for
those
product
be
accelerate
and
it
seem
clear
that
the
market
wasn
t
go
to
wait
if
ibm
didn
t
grab
the
business
somebody
else
would
and
we
would
never
have
this
kind
of
opportunity
again
like
every
one
of
my
father
s
employee
williams
and
i
have
be
train
to
think
of
even
a
single
order
lose
as
a
disaster
so
we
decide
to
push
ibm
as
rapidly
as
the
market
would
permit
even
though
this
would
mean
grow
on
a
scale
unprecedented
in
american
business
we
knew
that
as
we
near
the
top
of
the
fortune
ibm
would
have
to
be
totally
transform
every
entrepreneurial
company
if
it
succeed
must
eventually
face
the
transition
to
professional
management
in
our
case
dad
have
be
so
good
at
his
job
that
this
mature
process
be
long
overdue
as
big
as
ibm
now
be
it
have
almost
none
of
the
thing
that
corporation
count
on
to
keep
small
problem
from
ballooning
into
big
one
such
as
a
clear
chain
of
command
large
scale
decentralization
a
planning
process
or
formal
business
policy
our
way
of
get
thing
do
consist
mostly
of
wisdom
carry
in
a
few
people
s
head
if
we
kept
grow
and
try
to
run
a
billion
dollar
business
that
haphazardly
ibm
would
probably
not
survive
it
would
explode
like
a
supernova
and
end
up
a
dwarf
so
al
and
i
begin
talk
about
how
to
organize
ibm
more
scientifically
i
remember
the
first
thing
we
do
be
to
break
dad
s
taboo
against
organization
chart
we
get
big
sheet
of
paper
spread
them
out
on
a
table
and
put
down
all
the
segment
of
ibm
the
way
they
ran
under
dad
in
the
early
day
the
old
man
would
have
fire
anybody
he
found
do
this
we
be
absolutely
amaze
at
the
result
there
be
about
thirty
eight
or
forty
box
every
one
of
them
reporting
to
t
j
watson
then
we
do
another
chart
that
show
ibm
under
me
and
williams
and
lamotte
it
be
pretty
much
the
same
old
chaos
except
that
we
have
divide
dad
s
job
into
three
finally
we
drew
a
new
chart
show
how
a
reorganize
ibm
might
look
i
want
the
people
at
headquarters
free
to
concentrate
on
computer
and
punch
card
machine
so
we
make
our
other
operation
military
product
typewriter
punch
card
and
time
clock
into
autonomous
division
each
with
its
own
sale
force
financial
people
research
and
its
own
general
manager
who
would
make
the
decision
and
have
the
success
and
the
headache
this
be
the
begin
of
a
process
of
reorganization
that
go
on
for
all
the
year
i
ran
ibm
once
al
and
i
be
happy
with
our
chart
i
lock
them
up
in
a
cabinet
in
my
office
later
that
week
i
name
my
assistant
dick
bullen
as
director
of
organization
to
map
far
change
meanwhile
i
explain
our
idea
for
new
division
to
dad
he
approve
this
plan
without
any
of
the
fuss
he
put
up
over
williams
and
lamotte
but
i
don
t
think
the
reorganization
make
him
very
comfortable
at
one
point
he
told
a
newspaper
reporter
that
look
at
the
new
decentralize
ibm
he
d
be
more
interested
in
work
as
a
divisional
sale
manager
than
as
chairman
of
the
board
the
new
structure
we
create
left
plenty
of
room
for
world
trade
to
operate
separately
from
the
rest
of
ibm
my
brother
dick
s
side
of
the
business
be
become
a
great
success
because
of
europe
s
economic
revival
and
dad
s
genius
for
cop
with
trade
barrier
world
trade
be
grow
just
as
fast
as
ibm
domestic
it
pass
one
hundred
million
dollar
in
sale
in
dad
ran
it
and
dick
have
work
his
way
up
to
where
dad
make
him
president
that
summer
right
around
then
world
trade
also
move
out
of
ibm
s
headquarters
on
madison
avenue
to
office
across
the
street
from
the
new
united
nation
building
dick
be
thrive
in
his
job
he
knew
french
learn
italian
german
and
spanish
travel
incessantly
and
manage
that
complicate
business
extraordinarily
well
when
he
become
president
world
trade
be
already
operating
in
seventy
nine
country
with
full
blown
national
subsidiary
in
thirty
six
and
branch
office
and
sale
agency
in
the
rest
there
be
no
other
company
in
the
world
like
it
of
the
sixteen
thousand
employee
work
under
dick
only
two
hundred
be
american
and
almost
all
of
them
stayed
in
new
york
dad
have
the
philosophy
that
german
ought
to
sell
to
german
frenchman
ought
to
sell
to
frenchman
and
so
on
so
each
major
office
be
completely
manage
and
staffed
by
citizen
of
that
country
i
have
conflict
feeling
about
my
brother
move
up
and
it
be
hard
for
me
to
know
the
truth
behind
those
feeling
even
today
like
most
chief
executive
i
felt
the
desire
to
be
totally
dominant
in
the
company
i
be
run
but
i
also
love
my
brother
and
knew
that
dad
want
us
to
manage
ibm
in
tandem
by
this
time
dad
be
more
active
on
dick
s
side
of
the
business
than
mine
no
doubt
partly
because
he
be
try
to
stay
out
of
my
hair
but
i
also
suspect
he
be
act
out
of
competitiveness
turn
to
world
trade
as
if
to
say
i
ll
show
you
young
tom
you
don
t
want
to
listen
to
me
so
i
m
go
into
business
with
your
brother
whether
he
felt
that
way
or
not
there
be
strong
business
reason
for
him
to
concentrate
on
world
trade
he
want
ibm
to
be
a
global
force
and
world
trade
be
the
part
of
the
company
that
need
the
most
work
dad
have
be
drive
at
this
goal
since
he
be
forty
and
the
fact
that
he
be
now
eighty
only
make
him
more
impatient
as
i
look
back
i
can
imagine
how
rough
that
must
have
be
on
dick
but
at
the
time
i
be
jealous
of
the
closeness
he
and
dad
built
up
from
work
together
day
by
day
it
come
out
on
one
occasion
when
dad
have
some
sort
of
cerebral
spasm
he
be
in
a
guaranty
trust
company
board
meeting
and
start
to
say
something
but
he
couldn
t
get
the
word
out
that
sort
of
episode
isn
t
uncommon
in
old
people
it
can
be
a
prelude
to
a
stroke
but
dad
didn
t
have
one
when
he
recover
his
power
of
speech
after
a
few
minute
he
go
out
to
a
telephone
call
dick
and
ask
him
to
come
and
pick
him
up
i
felt
that
as
a
real
blow
i
kept
wonder
why
didn
t
he
call
me
i
thought
maybe
he
have
try
and
i
hadn
t
be
there
but
i
go
and
checked
my
secretary
s
telephone
log
and
no
call
have
come
dad
be
extremely
proud
of
dick
and
dick
be
very
close
mouth
about
the
detail
of
his
operation
there
be
nothing
i
could
do
but
stay
out
of
their
way
here
i
be
try
to
keep
ibm
run
with
reasonable
consistency
in
the
face
of
vast
growth
travel
constantly
deal
with
tremendous
number
of
people
and
yet
have
to
walk
on
specially
marked
path
when
it
come
to
business
abroad
dad
want
world
trade
to
be
as
independent
as
possible
but
as
anybody
could
see
it
could
never
be
completely
independent
the
two
side
have
to
be
coordinate
and
issue
routinely
come
up
such
as
whether
world
trade
would
manufacture
a
new
machine
itself
or
simply
get
it
from
our
u
s
plant
i
couldn
t
even
get
financial
information
about
that
side
of
our
business
at
one
point
i
sent
dad
an
exasperate
note
i
couldn
t
be
more
behind
your
plan
of
operating
the
world
trade
co
as
an
independent
subsidiary
i
will
defend
this
concept
operation
as
long
as
i
be
in
the
ibm
co
because
i
realize
the
soundness
of
a
separate
team
for
foreign
operation
nevertheless
a
minimum
of
financial
data
about
world
trade
result
be
vital
in
order
that
our
financial
department
can
reply
intelligently
to
outside
query
about
our
company
whenever
this
matter
come
under
discussion
between
domestic
ibm
people
yourself
it
appear
that
you
feel
we
be
try
to
usurp
power
from
world
trade
nothing
could
be
far
from
our
mind
on
the
other
hand
if
you
cannot
believe
this
have
peace
of
mind
the
only
thing
to
do
be
change
the
ibm
team
to
suit
yourself
i
don
t
recall
whether
he
finally
release
the
information
we
be
after
but
the
fundamental
dispute
never
get
resolve
dad
remain
convince
that
i
be
out
to
trip
my
brother
up
i
told
him
over
and
over
that
he
be
wrong
and
that
i
hop
dick
would
head
ibm
after
me
someday
i
told
my
brother
that
his
success
be
mine
and
mine
be
his
i
believe
these
thing
but
as
i
look
back
i
see
a
competitiveness
in
my
attitude
toward
dick
that
dad
be
aware
of
and
i
wasn
t
it
help
explain
why
in
his
old
age
he
be
work
so
hard
to
give
my
brother
a
sphere
of
his
own
dad
must
have
felt
as
if
ibm
wasn
t
entirely
his
anymore
but
i
didn
t
feel
as
if
it
be
mine
either
often
i
d
wonder
whether
i
be
have
any
real
impact
on
the
company
at
all
it
s
an
odd
thing
inherit
a
one
man
show
from
your
father
when
i
travel
as
president
group
of
ibm
people
would
often
come
to
greet
me
at
the
airport
partly
out
of
curiosity
but
mainly
because
that
s
what
they
d
always
do
for
dad
it
brought
back
scene
from
my
boyhood
large
ibm
crowd
wait
for
our
family
on
train
platform
or
as
we
docked
at
liverpool
harbor
dad
thrive
on
that
sort
of
attention
but
it
embarrass
me
so
i
told
people
not
to
do
it
part
of
my
job
be
to
inspect
the
local
ibm
office
wherever
i
happen
to
be
and
i
only
have
to
walk
into
one
of
these
place
to
be
remind
who
ibm
still
belong
to
it
be
full
of
the
old
fashion
practice
and
tradition
that
dad
have
start
we
still
have
our
song
and
banner
and
slogan
our
company
newspaper
our
code
of
behavior
and
dress
and
a
photograph
of
dad
in
every
room
some
of
these
custom
be
start
to
moderate
on
their
own
most
branch
manager
have
stop
make
the
salesman
sing
in
the
morning
before
go
out
to
call
on
customer
for
example
i
want
to
get
rid
of
the
hoopla
that
seem
ridiculous
for
a
mature
corporation
but
there
be
a
limit
to
what
i
could
do
many
of
these
practice
be
just
as
dear
to
the
people
who
work
in
those
place
as
they
be
to
dad
and
i
didn
t
want
to
offend
them
still
i
need
something
that
would
signal
that
i
be
run
ibm
now
and
that
time
have
change
we
be
a
computer
company
not
a
punch
card
company
we
be
firmly
in
the
s
not
the
s
we
be
leader
in
a
new
field
that
would
shape
the
future
i
decide
i
could
put
my
stamp
on
ibm
through
modern
design
dad
have
always
paid
close
attention
to
ibm
s
appearance
it
be
a
key
to
his
success
he
understood
earlier
than
most
american
businessmen
how
important
it
be
to
project
a
corporate
image
right
at
the
begin
when
the
company
be
just
hang
by
its
fingernail
he
improve
the
way
its
people
and
product
and
office
look
and
give
the
company
an
aura
of
solidity
that
raise
morale
and
won
customer
i
figure
that
what
have
work
for
him
would
work
for
me
the
computer
we
be
building
be
the
very
epitome
of
modern
technology
on
the
inside
but
on
the
outside
they
be
about
as
excite
as
a
collection
of
filing
cabinet
meanwhile
everything
else
about
ibm
look
obsolete
i
want
to
make
ibm
s
product
office
building
brochure
and
everything
the
public
saw
of
our
company
excite
and
modern
the
inspiration
for
the
design
program
come
to
me
during
a
stroll
i
take
down
fifth
avenue
in
the
early
s
i
found
myself
attract
to
a
shop
that
have
typewriter
on
sidewalk
stand
for
passersby
to
try
the
machine
be
do
in
different
color
and
have
sleek
design
i
go
inside
and
saw
modern
furniture
and
bright
color
that
all
work
together
and
give
the
shop
a
lively
feel
the
name
over
the
door
be
olivetti
a
few
month
later
an
old
family
friend
the
general
manager
of
ibm
holland
mail
me
a
thick
envelope
in
which
i
found
two
bundle
of
brochure
and
photograph
a
small
note
explain
that
the
first
be
a
collection
of
olivetti
advertisement
and
sale
literature
as
well
as
photograph
of
their
headquarters
plant
sale
office
employee
housing
and
product
the
second
bundle
be
of
similar
material
from
ibm
my
dutch
friend
suggest
that
all
i
have
to
do
be
to
lay
these
out
on
the
floor
in
two
column
and
i
d
see
ibm
have
to
improve
i
try
it
and
he
be
right
the
olivetti
material
be
fill
with
color
and
excitement
and
fit
together
like
a
beautiful
picture
puzzle
ours
look
like
direction
on
how
to
make
bicarbonate
of
soda
i
carry
that
envelope
with
me
to
a
conference
for
ibm
executive
in
late
it
be
at
an
old
resort
in
the
poconos
that
my
father
like
i
knock
on
the
door
of
dad
s
suite
during
a
quiet
hour
and
say
can
i
show
you
something
i
laid
the
material
out
for
him
on
a
large
table
i
think
we
can
do
even
well
than
these
people
if
we
just
get
our
designer
to
raise
their
sight
a
little
i
say
i
didn
t
press
the
point
because
dad
have
personally
approve
every
single
product
and
building
in
the
ibm
brochure
he
look
at
the
olivetti
thing
and
the
ibm
thing
and
say
quietly
i
see
what
you
mean
what
do
you
intend
to
do
i
told
him
i
want
to
hire
the
best
young
industrial
designer
i
knew
his
name
be
eliot
noyes
and
i
have
first
met
him
during
the
war
when
he
d
be
head
of
the
air
force
glider
program
i
d
run
across
him
again
year
later
when
he
design
a
good
look
new
typewriter
for
ibm
eliot
be
a
compact
guy
with
thick
glass
who
seem
extremely
unassertive
and
easygoing
but
he
have
strong
idea
about
what
do
and
didn
t
belong
in
a
product
s
design
basically
he
believe
that
machine
should
look
like
what
they
be
not
be
dress
up
in
phony
streamline
or
frill
the
same
principle
extend
to
architecture
in
which
eliot
be
also
train
the
first
project
i
put
him
on
be
the
ground
floor
of
ibm
s
world
headquarters
eliot
come
to
new
york
and
we
look
at
it
together
the
place
be
a
terrible
eyesore
and
project
a
split
personality
if
you
look
in
the
window
on
the
fifty
seventh
street
side
of
the
building
you
saw
the
defense
calculator
a
set
of
drab
gray
cabinet
in
a
large
room
with
dark
carpet
and
yellow
drape
but
if
you
walk
around
the
corner
onto
madison
avenue
and
go
in
the
main
lobby
you
found
yourself
back
in
the
s
dad
have
it
decorate
to
suit
his
taste
and
it
be
like
the
first
class
salon
on
an
ocean
liner
it
have
the
oriental
rug
he
love
and
black
marble
pillar
trim
with
gold
leaf
line
the
wall
be
punch
card
machine
and
time
clock
on
display
cordoned
off
by
velvet
rope
hooked
to
burnish
brass
post
our
ibm
would
look
dramatically
different
the
new
be
schedule
to
be
instal
in
the
lobby
the
follow
summer
we
decide
that
we
d
use
its
unveil
to
make
a
splash
we
cover
the
window
on
the
street
and
close
off
the
lobby
behind
the
receptionist
with
beaverboard
it
stayed
like
that
all
spring
while
we
get
the
place
ready
dad
have
give
his
approval
in
theory
but
once
he
be
bar
from
his
beloved
lobby
he
become
terribly
uneasy
he
d
walk
into
the
building
every
morning
and
look
at
that
beaverboard
barrier
then
he
d
say
to
me
why
can
t
i
get
in
there
if
i
d
let
him
he
probably
would
have
vetoed
the
whole
project
the
new
data
processing
center
be
modern
spare
and
very
dramatic
eliot
make
the
floor
completely
white
he
make
the
wall
a
vivid
red
he
put
up
understated
sign
that
read
ibm
in
silver
on
the
red
wall
it
be
a
beautiful
presentation
for
anybody
who
be
interested
in
modern
design
the
product
make
the
statement
not
the
surroundings
before
we
open
the
lobby
to
the
public
we
ask
father
down
to
see
it
he
have
a
whole
coterie
of
guy
follow
him
with
notebook
as
he
walk
through
he
look
at
the
which
be
do
in
the
standard
gray
finish
trim
with
chrome
set
against
the
red
wall
as
a
background
dad
kept
look
at
the
wall
then
back
at
the
computer
then
back
at
the
wall
finally
i
say
dad
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
like
it
he
say
i
like
it
a
lot
i
particularly
like
that
wall
that
wall
be
paint
if
any
of
you
fellow
should
ever
decide
that
you
don
t
like
it
you
can
change
it
overnight
this
compliment
while
left
hand
be
good
enough
for
me
i
kept
the
wall
the
way
it
be
we
open
the
door
the
next
day
to
a
hundred
reporter
and
photographer
and
the
day
after
that
the
head
of
forty
railroad
from
all
over
america
come
at
our
invitation
to
spend
a
morning
learn
about
the
new
computer
the
data
processing
center
generate
enormous
excitement
like
the
ssec
and
the
that
have
precede
it
in
the
window
the
be
actually
a
work
machine
customer
who
want
to
rent
computer
time
would
simply
bring
their
data
in
and
we
kept
the
computer
run
around
the
clock
if
you
go
by
on
madison
avenue
in
the
middle
of
the
night
you
would
see
it
behind
the
big
plate
glass
window
tend
by
well
dress
technician
in
its
brightly
lit
room
work
with
noyes
be
quite
an
education
he
come
from
an
old
boston
family
and
have
a
real
streak
of
yankee
independence
when
i
offer
him
a
big
job
as
director
of
all
of
ibm
s
architectural
and
industrial
design
he
turn
me
down
flat
i
ll
work
with
you
not
for
you
he
say
the
only
way
i
can
do
this
job
right
be
to
have
full
access
to
top
management
so
we
make
an
arrangement
whereby
he
pledge
a
major
part
of
his
time
to
ibm
and
i
name
him
consultant
director
of
design
the
next
thing
he
straighten
me
out
on
be
my
idea
of
give
ibm
a
recognizable
style
i
want
the
factory
product
and
sale
office
all
do
in
such
a
way
that
a
person
could
look
at
any
of
them
and
say
instantly
that
s
ibm
but
noyes
say
this
would
be
self
defeat
if
we
try
to
fix
a
single
uniform
corporate
image
it
would
eventually
become
tire
and
date
instead
he
suggest
that
ibm
s
theme
be
simply
the
best
in
modern
design
whenever
we
need
something
built
or
decorate
we
would
commission
the
best
architect
designer
and
artist
and
give
them
a
relatively
free
hand
to
explore
new
idea
in
their
own
style
as
it
turn
out
noyes
be
a
fantastic
judge
of
talent
and
the
people
he
found
for
us
be
as
great
a
contribution
as
the
award
win
product
and
building
he
design
himself
we
need
architect
in
particular
because
we
be
just
about
to
begin
the
great
factory
expansion
in
ibm
history
by
our
factory
in
both
endicott
and
poughkeepsie
be
overflow
with
almost
ten
thousand
employee
each
in
the
nearby
community
of
owego
and
kingston
we
be
building
huge
satellite
plant
to
house
ten
thousand
more
worker
for
our
military
work
still
we
need
more
manufacturing
and
i
didn
t
want
it
all
in
these
place
we
be
already
in
danger
of
turn
them
into
company
town
and
drive
other
employer
out
so
we
begin
a
great
movement
west
dad
have
extend
our
business
across
america
by
incessant
travel
in
train
and
car
but
he
like
to
stay
close
to
his
factory
and
for
that
reason
he
kept
them
near
new
york
but
i
be
a
pilot
and
i
m
sure
that
the
midwest
and
california
seem
much
less
distant
to
me
than
they
do
to
t
j
we
decide
to
build
major
plant
in
rochester
minnesota
which
be
the
home
of
the
mayo
clinic
and
san
jose
we
envision
each
place
to
be
another
endicott
an
ibm
center
complete
with
a
factory
and
a
school
and
an
engineering
lab
only
the
design
would
be
different
eero
saarinen
be
the
architect
eliot
chose
for
rochester
it
be
the
first
great
test
of
his
idea
that
we
should
hire
top
people
because
saarinen
be
already
famous
and
quite
expensive
he
design
us
a
complex
of
connect
building
laid
out
in
a

and
modern
sculpture
bright
color
metal
panel
fasten
to
the
wall
make
the
place
lively
and
the
employee
could
sit
on
the
terrace
and
eat
lunch
with
a
view
of
the
mountain
in
the
distance
that
plant
have
a
small
place
in
history
as
the
first
computer
factory
in
the
san
jose
area
i
remember
go
out
to
buy
the
land
a
acre
walnut
grove
i
have
told
our
real
estate
manager
we
have
to
build
quickly
or
we
ll
be
in
tough
shape
he
met
me
at
the
airport
and
say
we
can
take
possession
any
time
we
want
but
it
ll
cost
you
an
extra
eight
hundred
thousand
dollar
if
we
do
it
in
the
next
five
month
what
i
say
why
be
that
because
that
s
what
the
walnut
crop
be
worth
i
be
try
not
to
get
us
financially
overextend
so
i
decide
to
wait
until
the
farmer
harvest
his
walnut
then
we
put
up
our
plant
there
be
a
few
other
company
around
mainly
defense
contractor
like
lockheed
and
we
be
plant
the
seed
of
what
later
become
silicon
valley
my
father
knew
that
he
be
vulnerable
to
criticism
for
stay
on
the
job
as
long
as
he
have
he
have
set
ibm
s
retirement
age
at
sixty
five
and
yet
here
he
be
more
than
eighty
year
old
still
take
his
salary
and
a
percentage
of
the
profit
pull
in
over
a
thousand
dollar
a
day
he
make
a
point
of
never
bring
up
his
age
or
his
health
and
although
he
be
less
and
less
active
each
year
no
shareholder
ever
challenged
him
on
whether
he
be
still
earn
his
pay
because
the
record
spoke
for
itself
my
friend
robert
galvin
of
motorola
have
a
philosophy
about
this
he
told
me
the
founder
of
a
business
have
the
right
to
stay
on
until
he
dy
he
can
take
all
sort
of
privilege
and
enjoy
all
sort
of
perquisite
but
those
who
succeed
him
whether
they
belong
to
his
family
or
not
do
not
have
the
same
right
galvin
have
be
think
about
the
question
because
he
be
in
the
process
of
take
over
motorola
from
his
own
father
and
i
use
him
as
my
guide
whether
have
dad
around
be
good
or
bad
for
me
i
can
t
really
judge
at
time
it
be
quite
difficult
to
refrain
from
say
for
god
s
sake
dad
i
m
run
this
thing
now
because
i
felt
terribly
frustrate
but
on
the
other
hand
as
long
as
he
be
still
chief
executive
i
never
have
to
bear
full
responsibility
i
discuss
my
important
decision
with
him
and
always
felt
him
there
as
a
backstop
toward
the
end
of
his
life
dad
would
disappear
from
the
office
for
week
at
a
time
he
love
to
take
long
practically
aimless
trip
around
the
united
state
dad
always
felt
best
when
he
be
on
the
move
he
d
get
mother
and
his
chauffeur
and
some
suitcase
and
drive
as
far
as
chicago
or
they
d
start
from
san
francisco
and
drive
eastward
visit
ibm
office
all
along
the
way
and
every
night
sit
down
to
a
family
dinner
with
the
local
group
from
ibm
dad
always
spoke
at
these
gathering
say
how
grateful
he
be
to
mother
and
reminisce
about
how
the
two
of
them
have
travel
together
more
than
a
million
mile
we
ve
never
really
be
away
from
home
because
we
ve
always
be
right
in
the
ibm
family
he
d
say
mother
would
sit
by
his
side
smile
sweetly
and
she
d
sometimes
tug
on
his
coattail
if
he
go
on
too
long
she
never
say
more
than
a
simple
thank
you
herself
i
never
knew
what
to
expect
when
dad
go
off
on
a
trip
one
of
the
eccentricity
that
make
him
difficult
be
his
conviction
that
he
could
pick
talent
just
by
look
at
a
man
at
every
dinner
he
go
to
there
would
be
a
receive
line
and
he
and
mother
would
stand
there
while
dad
shook
hand
with
everybody
even
if
there
be
five
hundred
people
there
would
always
be
a
secretary
stand
opposite
unobtrusively
with
a
notebook
when
dad
met
a
man
he
thought
look
like
a
fine
square
cut
fellow
he
d
nod
slightly
and
the
secretary
would
seek
the
man
out
mr
watson
would
like
to
have
your
name
your
position
and
where
you
live
he
d
say
dad
would
often
send
the
man
to
us
in
new
york
this
work
more
often
than
not
but
when
it
didn
t
it
be
a
headache
both
for
the
man
and
for
me
during
his
travel
dad
would
sometimes
send
a
memo
express
his
worry
about
the
expense
ibm
be
run
up
in
the
field
sometimes
he
d
visit
a
customer
and
get
embroil
in
try
to
help
a
local
office
close
a
sale
one
episode
start
when
he
paid
a
call
on
the
executive
of
a
miami
bank
over
lunch
they
mention
they
be
think
of
replace
one
or
two
ibm
machine
with
specialized
banking
equipment
make
by
somebody
else
this
be
a
routine
sale
problem
be
handle
by
our
local
office
but
the
prospect
of
ibm
s
lose
a
rental
to
a
competitor
upset
dad
a
lot
he
sent
me
an
urgent
three
page
single
space
letter
and
point
out
this
have
cause
me
to
put
forth
great
effort
in
connection
with
one
particular
machine
application
than
i
have
ever
do
before
in
all
my
year
with
the
company
happily
i
be
able
to
tell
dad
that
we
be
about
to
announce
new
banking
equipment
that
would
do
exactly
what
the
customer
want
and
the
account
be
save
dig
into
local
situation
be
something
every
good
executive
do
on
occasion
but
i
didn
t
like
to
see
my
father
get
so
upset
i
would
drop
everything
until
i
could
reassure
him
but
eventually
i
ran
out
of
patience
early
in
a
woman
write
mother
a
letter
say
her
husband
have
be
fire
unjustly
from
ibm
the
man
be
a
low
level
manager
i
ll
call
smith
who
have
be
caught
do
something
wrong
and
have
be
fire
mother
be
upset
and
show
the
letter
to
dad
who
become
so
angry
about
the
apparent
injustice
that
he
felt
ill
and
have
to
go
to
bed
it
seem
to
me
there
be
much
more
at
issue
than
our
handle
of
one
employee
my
parent
be
worried
that
with
dad
less
active
ibm
s
management
be
lose
the
concern
for
the
individual
he
have
try
to
build
into
it
i
be
convince
that
wasn
t
so
and
sat
down
to
explain
on
paper
to
both
of
them
the
role
i
want
dad
to
play
it
be
the
long
letter
i
ever
sent
them
twelve
page
and
i
pour
into
it
everything
i
thought
about
ibm
our
prospect
and
problem
and
my
accomplishment
as
president
i
want
to
convince
him
once
and
for
all
to
spare
himself
and
leave
the
run
of
the
business
to
me
all
of
the
thought
which
you
dad
have
express
to
me
about
the
possibility
of
thing
not
go
well
in
ibm
the
fact
that
we
must
watch
expense
the
fact
that
if
the
business
start
slip
it
s
hard
to
stop
these
be
all
fact
which
i
knew
about
before
you
mention
them
in
truth
they
be
possibility
which
i
go
to
bed
with
every
night
if
they
should
come
about
my
reputation
as
a
businessman
be
vanished
my
reputation
as
a
successful
son
be
finish
no
wonder
i
think
about
them
frequently
i
have
get
to
make
good
there
be
literally
hundred
of
incident
throughout
the
year
like
the
smith
situation
that
mr
smith
saw
fit
to
write
you
mother
be
unfortunate
but
before
she
do
the
matter
have
be
fairly
well
settle
therefore
i
don
t
believe
we
should
panic
or
be
rush
into
decision
because
of
a
dishonest
man
who
have
be
fire
i
would
tend
to
discount
his
threat
and
allegation
let
s
suppose
though
that
mr
smith
have
not
write
you
let
s
suppose
we
handle
the
matter
as
we
do
isn
t
it
vital
that
we
be
capable
as
a
team
of
handle
these
matter
well
because
you
both
can
t
know
of
all
of
them
nor
can
i
if
the
present
team
isn
t
operating
to
your
satisfaction
i
believe
you
should
make
adjustment
until
you
have
a
group
in
which
you
have
complete
faith
a
group
who
can
give
you
peace
of
mind
about
the
ibm
co
nothing
would
please
me
more
or
help
me
more
than
to
have
your
advice
on
every
matter
which
come
to
my
attention
much
of
the
time
i
m
somewhat
in
the
dark
but
i
don
t
share
your
fear
about
ibm
i
believe
the
company
be
as
strong
as
it
have
ever
be
with
as
competent
a
management
as
ever
and
as
well
run
as
ever
this
be
because
you
have
train
me
to
think
along
the
line
you
think
and
because
you
have
permit
me
to
pick
a
team
of
the
strong
men
in
the
business
if
i
be
right
in
my
belief
about
ibm
then
it
ought
to
be
possible
for
the
builder
of
this
great
business
to
drop
around
and
chat
with
us
about
our
really
important
problem
our
department
of
justice
case
how
much
of
our
capital
investment
should
go
into
electronics
how
we
should
improve
the
time
division
how
we
can
find
and
upgrade
more
executive
possibility
from
the
field
this
rather
than
get
involve
in
criticize
our
operation
as
in
the
smith
matter
or
the
general
administration
of
the
company
can
you
not
by
look
at
our
annual
report
convince
yourself
that
we
be
not
do
too
bad
a
job
can
you
not
take
some
pride
in
the
fact
that
the
job
be
be
do
by
t
j
watson
train
men
can
you
not
find
some
personal
satisfaction
and
peace
of
mind
in
watch
this
wonderful
business
enterprise
which
you
have
built
grow
on
to
great
height
move
forward
on
all
front
with
a
continue
fine
profit
direct
by
your
team
love
to
you
both
tom
as
i
look
back
much
of
this
be
beside
the
point
an
example
of
my
own
desire
to
have
total
command
because
on
the
big
issue
affect
ibm
s
future
dad
already
be
defer
to
me
serve
more
as
mentor
than
as
bos
he
have
pretty
much
stop
fight
with
me
but
it
take
me
a
while
to
notice
he
d
gotten
over
his
aversion
to
debt
for
example
and
with
his
permission
williams
and
i
increase
ibm
s
borrowing
at
a
rate
roughly
equal
to
our
growth
we
end
up
owe
the
prudential
well
over
a
third
of
a
billion
dollar
all
of
which
be
amply
cover
by
the
profit
roll
in
from
new
equipment
built
by
our
expand
factory
dad
also
let
me
make
dramatic
improvement
in
ibm
s
pension
and
benefit
plan
the
change
be
in
line
with
his
idea
after
the
war
of
relieve
ibm
people
of
fear
for
the
care
of
themselves
and
their
family
but
they
go
far
beyond
what
he
have
envision
the
pension
he
d
put
in
be
advanced
for
their
day
but
the
most
any
employee
could
retire
on
be
a
year
depend
solely
on
the
number
of
year
he
or
she
have
work
for
the
company
under
the
new
alternative
formula
which
be
more
in
keep
with
the
time
we
take
salary
as
well
as
service
into
account
and
a
retiree
could
collect
as
much
as
a
year
ibm
also
become
one
of
the
first
company
in
america
to
offer
major
medical
insurance
but
the
concession
that
surprised
me
the
most
be
dad
s
let
me
persuade
him
to
give
stock
option
for
the
first
time
he
be
always
conservative
about
anything
have
to
do
with
ibm
s
stock
although
he
never
own
more
than
about
five
percent
of
ibm
which
include
stock
he
put
in
family
trust
or
give
to
other
family
member
as
well
as
his
personal
holding
dad
always
operate
as
though
the
company
belong
to
him
in
earlier
year
the
very
mention
of
sell
more
stock
would
sometimes
send
him
into
a
rage
dad
never
issue
any
option
and
didn
t
believe
in
them
but
he
urge
ibm
employee
and
everyone
else
he
met
to
invest
in
the
stock
some
of
the
men
who
make
sandwich
behind
the
counter
at
halper
s
drugstore
next
door
to
our
headquarters
where
i
have
coffee
as
a
young
salesman
before
the
war
end
up
with
fortune
but
in
spite
of
the
dim
view
he
take
of
option
dad
stop
object
as
soon
as
i
told
him
they
have
become
accepted
practice
and
that
we
couldn
t
hang
on
to
our
best
executive
without
them
the
option
we
give
be
liberal
about
five
time
the
employee
s
salary
so
that
executive
make
get
in
option
that
be
probably
worth
seven
million
dollar
eventually
in
the
first
two
round
more
than
fifty
people
get
them
and
each
one
end
up
a
wealthy
man
the
only
issue
we
still
fought
about
be
antitrust
after
the
government
lawsuit
be
file
in
ibm
spent
the
last
year
of
truman
s
administration
and
the
first
couple
of
year
of
eisenhower
s
in
negotiation
with
the
justice
department
i
be
determine
to
settle
the
suit
before
it
go
to
trial
periodically
our
lawyer
would
have
me
come
to
the
federal
courthouse
in
manhattan
and
sit
at
a
long
table
with
the
justice
department
lawyer
and
the
judge
he
be
a
short
raspy
voiced
man
name
david
edelstein
only
a
few
year
old
than
i
this
be
the
big
antitrust
case
he
d
ever
have
and
he
be
determine
to
do
an
exemplary
job
but
he
never
have
much
to
say
to
me
and
neither
do
the
prosecutor
and
i
always
thought
those
meeting
accomplish
very
little
whether
there
be
legal
reason
they
couldn
t
talk
or
whether
they
just
thought
i
be
stupid
and
not
worth
their
time
i
could
never
tell
i
always
have
the
impression
that
they
be
more
comfortable
talk
to
our
lawyer
dad
knew
we
be
negotiate
but
in
some
part
of
his
mind
he
be
still
adamantly
oppose
to
signing
a
consent
decree
one
day
he
show
up
at
ibm
earlier
than
usual
while
i
be
get
ready
to
go
to
the
courthouse
he
be
sit
at
his
desk
riffle
through
his
mail
to
see
what
be
interest
and
what
he
have
to
do
in
the
way
of
chore
and
he
must
have
thought
tom
i
can
see
tom
so
at
about
nine
o
clock
the
frightful
little
buzzer
he
have
in
my
office
rang
my
appointment
downtown
be
for
nine
thirty
but
i
never
ignore
that
buzzer
so
i
go
up
the
stair
to
his
office
good
morning
son
he
say
sit
down
i
sat
down
and
wait
for
a
minute
while
he
kept
reading
his
mail
say
dad
i
have
an
appointment
what
s
that
i

an
appointment

t
you

me
up
to
date
what

downtown
for
it
s
on
this
antitrust
matter
i
m
go
down
to
talk
to
the
judge
he
instantly
go
into
a
rage
you
re
totally
incompetent
to
do
that
you
have
no
background
what
do
you
mean
you
re
go
down
to
talk
to
the
judge
so
i
say

ve
be
talk
to
the
judge
every
week
down
there
you
ve
know
all
about
it
and
we
re
go
to
talk
some
more
today
now
young
man
i
ve
be
mixed
up
in
antitrust
all
my
life
i
know
all
about
antitrust
i
know
about
those
people
down
at
the
justice
department
it
s
awfully
easy
to
say
the
wrong
thing
down
there
i
be
forty
one
year
old
but
he
really
bloody
the
wall
with
me
i
say
dad
i
m
go
to
be
ten
minute
late
if
i
leave
right
now
so
you
either
tell
me
you
want
me
to
go
and
i
ll
leave
or
tell
me
you
don
t
and
i
ll
call
and
cancel
he
say
no
you
go
but
don
t
you
make
any
decision
there
be
a
car
wait
for
me
downstairs
and
i
go
and
get
in
i
be
so
upset
that
i
be
shake
i
get
to
the
courthouse
and
sat
down
at
that
long
table
i
didn
t
say
very
much
to
anybody
because
i
be
so
tense
then
into
the
back
of
the
room
come
dad
s
personal
secretary
i
thought
oh
god
dad
s
have
a
stroke
and
die
but
the
secretary
simply
pass
me
a
little
slip
of
paper
torn
out
of
a
think
notebook
it
say

confidence
appreciation
admiration
love
dad
it
be
my
father
s
way
of
tell
me
i
realize
i
shouldn
t
be
throw
you
around
at
your
age
the
relief
be
so
great
that
my
eye
fill
with
tear
the
judge
say
i
take
it
you
ve
have
some
bad
news
no
i
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
s
rather
good
news
it
s
just
emotional
news
eventually
dad
let
me
persuade
him
that
the
prudent
thing
to
do
be
sign
the
consent
decree
our
lawyer
sign
on
behalf
of
ibm
in
january
settle
that
case
be
one
of
the
best
move
we
ever
make
because
it
clear
the
way
for
ibm
to
keep
expand
at
top
speed
with
dad
the
consent
decree
be
always
a
sore
spot
and
we
never
discuss
it
again
but
there
be
no
longer
any
doubt
for
either
of
us
that
i
be
run
the
show
in
retrospect
i
think
dad
may
have
felt
relieve
to
have
our
long
struggle
at
an
end
i
wish
i
d
notice
it
at
the
time
because
it
would
have
make
me
go
easy
on
him
one
thing
i
kept
try
to
persuade
him
to
do
be
ease
up
on
ibm
s
liquor
ban
even
though
i
knew
he
d
care
passionately
about
that
issue
his
whole
life
i
say
dad
we
hold
these
ibm
dinner
and
the
people
come
half
an
hour
or
forty
five
minute
ahead
of
time
and
they
have
to
drink
orange
juice
it
s
an
awkward
time
maybe
we
should
have
white
wine
during
that
period
you
can
t
temporize
with
that
he
say
you
start
with
white
wine
and
the
next
thing
you
know
look
i
say
let
s
be
realistic
what
be
people
do
now
they
come
to
a
banquet
and
one
in
every
ten
of
them
take
a
room
in
the
hotel
he
put
a
nice
array
of
booze
up
there
and
everybody
go
and
fortifies
himself
before
the
party
that
s
not
so
great
either
dad
seem
determine
not
to
budge
but
the
follow
week
there
be
a
large
meeting
of
ibm
engineer
and
scientist
in
florida
and
both
he
and
i
be
schedule
to
go
i
d
be
travel
and
arrive
a
bit
late
when
i
walk
into
the
banquet
hall
i
thought
i
detect
a
slightly
louder
tone
than
usual
they
show
me
to
the
head
table
and
i
be
bending
over
to
kiss
dad
when
i
saw
that
they
have
wine
in
ice
bucket
and
not
just
beside
his
table
but
all
the
table
i
get
mcdowell
the
chief
of
engineering
off
to
the
side
and
say
wally
what
in
hell
be
this
your
father
call
me
twenty
minute
before
the
dinner
and
say
why
don
t
we
have
wine
for
everybody
so
i
order
wine
when
i
make
a
speech
i
say
this
be
a
precedent
break
dinner
there
be
a
roar
of
laughter
but
later
on
i
get
dad
in
his
suite
and
ask
him
why
he
have
do
it
he
say
you
make
such
a
point
about
have
wine
you
re
young
you
understand
these
thing
and
i
d
hate
to
be
an
old
fuddy
dud
so
i
change
it
of
course
he
knew
that
news
of
that
dinner
would
travel
to
every
corner
of
ibm
instantly
and
it
be
go
to
take
me
week
to
put
any
rhyme
or
reason
back
into
our
liquor
policy
i
be
amaze
it
be
the
first
time
dad
have
show
the
mischievous
side
of
his
personality
in
maybe
twenty
five
year
now
that
i
be
become
the
bos
he
be
play
a
prank
by
act
like
my
yes
man
three
month
later
in
may
dad
formally
pass
the
job
of
chief
executive
on
to
me
he
make
the
gesture
spontaneously
and
with
a
great
sense
of
dignity
which
meant
a
lot
to
me
because
it
be
the
first
promotion
i
ever
get
from
him
without
a
fight
after
the
board
vote
its
approval
i
go
to
a
bank
and
bought
a
stack
of
five
dollar
gold
piece
i
hand
them
out
to
the
director
over
lunch
and
give
a
speech
about
dad
s
year
be
the
golden
year
of
ibm
then
come
a
press
conference
and
the
new
york
time
picture
the
next
morning
of
dad
and
me
shake
hand
he
make
a
point
of
tell
the
newspaper
i
be
not
retire
i
simply
want
to
spend
more
time
with
ibm
world
trade
corporation
within
a
week
dad
make
a
similar
move
with
dick
promote
him
to
chief
executive
of
world
trade
i
somehow
have
it
in
my
head
that
dad
would
stay
around
indefinitely
that
he
d
be
by
my
side
as
a
kind
of
consultant
just
as
he
have
become
during
the
past
year
but
his
health
have
begin
to
fail
he
d
have
an
uneasy
time
that
winter
in
florida
he
couldn
t
eat
right
because
of
his
stomach
ulcer
for
as
long
as
i
could
remember
dad
have
trouble
with
his
stomach
he
be
constantly
suffer
from
indigestion
and
take
bicarbonate
of
soda
as
a
boy
i
use
to
listen
to
him
let
out
tremendous
belch
behind
close
door
and
then
go
on
about
his
business
sometimes
he
have
trouble
with
bleeding
as
well
but
never
any
pain
the
idea
that
he
have
ulcer
be
intolerable
to
him
because
in
his
old
fashion
way
of
look
at
thing
the
only
people
who
get
stomach
ulcer
be
people
who
drank
he
forgot
that
for
twenty
five
year
he
d
smoke
cigar
one
after
another
and
he
never
accepted
the
idea
that
ulcer
can
be
brought
on
by
stress
dad
s
doctor
be
name
arthur
antenucci
he
be
a
great
diagnostician
whose
patient
include
the
duke
of
windsor
after
he
look
at
x
ray
of
dad
s
stomach
he
told
me
your
father
s
stomach
look
like
the
battlefield
of
the
marne
the
tension
of
dad
s
career
have
pretty
much
pull
him
apart
inside
antenucci
say
that
the
buildup
of
scar
tissue
be
so
bad
that
the
exit
to
dad
s
stomach
be
gradually
closing
up
that
be
why
he
couldn
t
eat
a
simple
operation
would
have
remedied
it
but
dad
chose
not
to
have
it
do
he
hat
the
idea
of
go
under
the
knife
as
much
as
he
hat
the
idea
of
fly
in
an
airplane
he
d
never
have
an
operation
not
even
to
fix
the
painful
hernia
he
d
have
for
half
his
life
he
just
kept
put
on
his
truss
every
morning
and
never
complain
antenucci
warn
dad
that
the
scar
tissue
problem
could
kill
him
if
it
turn
into
a
total
blockage
and
for
a
while
dad
agree
to
get
his
stomach
fix
but
then
he
change
his
mind
he
and
mother
be
at
the
dinner
table
one
night
and
dad
say
i
don
t
think
i
m
go
through
with
that
operation
but
tom
she
say
you
told
dr
antenucci
you
would
that
s
true
say
my
father
but
you
know
as
he
be
leave
the
room
i
could
just
see
him
sharpen
his
knife
without
the
surgery
his
digestion
begin
to
fail
and
my
father
slowly
but
surely
starve
over
the
course
of
a
year
he
lose
twenty
or
thirty
pound
and
by
the
spring
of
he
look
very
frail
the
only
thing
he
d
let
antenucci
do
be
give
him
blood
transfusion
for
the
last
several
month
of
his
life
dad
would
go
down
to
roosevelt
hospital
about
every
three
week
and
get
new
blood
it
would
pep
him
up
for
a
while
but
then
he
d
hit
a
period
of
exhaustion
until
the
next
transfusion
it
s
strange
to
me
that
a
man
as
powerful
as
dad
should
have
be
so
superstitious
but
he
be
totally
lucid
when
he
decide
against
surgery
and
none
of
us
felt
we
have
a
right
to
intrude
the
old
man
have
burst
of
amaze
vigor
right
up
to
the
end
i
will
never
forget
the
last
time
i
saw
him
before
an
ibm
audience
it
be
at
a
sale
meeting
in
washington
that
march
there
be
perhaps
five
hundred
people
assemble
in
a
large
hotel
auditorium
father
get
there
late
the
man
run
the
meeting
spot
him
in
the
back
of
the
room
and
say
i
see
that
we
have
the
honor
of
mr
watson
s
presence
mr
watson
won
t
you
come
up
and
take
the
floor
dad
be
a
wispy
old
man
of
eighty
two
and
he
start
carefully
down
the
inclined
aisle
toward
the
stage
the
men
jumped
to
their
foot
and
be
clap
and
shout
the
more
they
clapped
and
the
farther
he
get
down
the
aisle
the
more
erect
he
become
he
stood
up
straighter
and
straighter
and
walk
faster
and
faster
until
he
finally
get
to
the
step
lead
up
to
the
stage
he
go
up
them
with
such
a
surge
of
energy
that
he
seem
to
take
them
two
at
a
time
the
thrill
of
salesman
s
accolade
be
so
great
that
dad
shed
about
thirty
year
on
the
way
down
that
aisle
he
grabbed
the
podium
and
make
a
very
stir
speech
punch
his
fist
into
his
hand
and
tell
the
men
how
they
must
take
advantage
of
the
great
opportunity
before
us
and
how
ibm
be
go
on
forever
i
think
that
by
the
time
he
turn
the
company
over
to
me
he
must
have
felt
the
hand
of
death
on
his
shoulder
perhaps
that
be
the
only
thing
that
could
have
make
him
decide
to
step
down
but
i
also
think
he
will
his
death
by
refuse
medical
treatment
if
dick
and
i
hadn
t
be
ready
if
he
d
still
felt
ibm
depend
entirely
on
him
maybe
he
d
have
risk
surgery
and
survive
a
few
year
more
but
he
could
see
that
i
be
run
the
business
well
and
he
could
see
dick
gain
more
and
more
recognition
abroad
i
suppose
he
thought
it
have
be
a
good
life
i
guess
it
s
about
the
time
within
a
month
it
be
obvious
that
he
be
go
to
die
it
be
a
swelter
june
in
new
york
and
dad
stayed
up
at
his
country
house
in
new
canaan
the
election
campaign
be
on
and
he
take
a
lot
of
pleasure
in
watch
it
on
television
and
laugh
at
the
way
politician
repeat
themselves
he
be
totally
lucid
not
in
any
pain
but
he
have
no
strength
left
because
of
his
inability
to
eat
he
get
more
blood
transfusion
which
would
briefly
perk
him
up
but
then
he
d
slip
back
i
visit
him
early
in
the
month
before
go
up
to
newport
rhode
island
to
get
ready
for

t

when

canaan
dad

perfectly
lucid
he

too
bad

t
have
to
interrupt
your
race
i
just

to
be
around
i
say
my
brother
and
sister

also
at
the
house
dad
be
lie
in
bed
and
have
each
of
us
in
for
a
long
visit
one
of
us
would
go
in
and
talk
and
then
mother
would
say
why
don
t
you
let
him
rest
a
little
after
a
time
the
next
would
go
in
dad
knew
he
be
go
to
die
but
he
never
say
this
be
how
i
want
you
to
take
care
of
your
mother
or
anything
like
that
instead
he
be
just
renew
his
contact
with
each
of
his
child
i
have
a
long
pleasant
conversation
with
him
that
seem
to
cover
everything
under
the
sun
he
talk
about
the
confidence
he
have
built
up
in
me
over
the
ten
year
we
have
work
together
and
how
he
knew
that
the
company
be
go
to
move
ahead
rapidly
in
the
right
direction
and
become
much
much
big
then
somehow
we
get
onto
the
subject
of
antique
furniture
he
say
if
you
ever
see
a
piece
of
furniture
you
like
buy
it
even
if
you
don
t
think
you
can
afford
it
because
if
you
don
t
buy
it
you
ll
wish
for
the
rest
of
your
life
that
you
have
dad
have
a
chance
to
talk
to
all
of
us
but
the
next
day
he
lose
consciousness
it
be
a
sunday
and
we
have
a
doctor
come
out
to
the
house
he
say
dad
be
suffer
from
heart
failure
and
get
an
ambulance
to
drive
him
to
new
york
meanwhile
i
call
antenucci
who
have
a
house
on
shelter
island
i
be
pique
at
him
because
in
those
day
i
didn
t
understand
as
i
do
now
that
many
doctor
set
aside
time
when
they
re
go
to
work
when
they
ll
go
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
or
do
anything
else
that
s
necessary
and
other
time
when
they
re
go
to
rest
antenucci
be
in
a
rest
period
he
arrange
a
room
for
dad
at
roosevelt
hospital
and
have
an
assistant
greet
him
at
the
door
but
he
didn
t
come
in
until
the
next
day
it
be
too
late
to
operate
for
the
stomach
blockage
that
be
cause
dad
s
problem
antenucci
told
me
your
father
be
go
to
die
dad
have
regain
consciousness
but
he
begin
drift
in
and
out
of
it
we
d
go
in
to
see
him
and
sometimes
he
d
recognize
us
and
sometimes
he
wouldn
t
i
remember
his
stomach
get
swollen
you
could
see
it
through
the
sheet
telegram
and
message
begin
pour
in
from
all
over
the
world
president
eisenhower
try
to
call
and
when
he
found
out
dad
couldn
t
talk
he
sent
a
message
it
say
something
like
you
have
have
a
terrific
life
but
you
have
many
more
thing
to
give
so
get
well
soon
i
go
in
and
read
it
to
dad
several
time
and
he
seem
to
hear
it
antenucci
be
do
thing
that
upset
me
put
tube
into
dad
and
so
on
dad
obviously
be
unhappy
about
it
because
he
make
noise
to
indicate
he
didn
t
like
it
so
i
say
for
god
s
sake
the
man
be
die
let
him
die
in
peace
there
s
no
chance
of
him
survive
be
there
no
antenucci
say
but
we
doctor
still
have
to
do
what
we
can
well
you
know
i
ve
talk
to
my
mother
and
the
other
child
we
think
you
ought
to
try
to
keep
him
comfortable
but
not
stick
thing
in
him
anymore
so
they
stop
a
couple
of
day
go
by
from
time
to
time
each
of
us
would
go
to
the
church
up
the
street
and
say
a
prayer
but
not
with
any
idea
that
dad
would
live
it
be
a
joyous
and
very
sad
time
this
old
gentleman
have
in
a
variety
of
way
command
tremendous
love
and
respect
from
all
five
of
us
i
can
t
characterize
anybody
s
grief
but
my
own
but
i
felt
as
if
a
very
big
piece
of
my
life
be
be
pull
away
he
be
the
foundation
on
which
i
have
be
stand
for
forty
two
year
i
have
an
awful
hollow
feel
about
the
future
how
it
would
be
without
this
man
i
have
fought
with
so
underneath
it
all
nobody
ever
have
a
great
influence
on
anyone
else
than
t
j
watson
have
on
me
i
ll
never
forget
the
moment
of
his
death
all
our
life
we
build
up
a
tremendous
desire
to
live
jumping
away
from
car
run
out
of
burning
building
that
instinct
have
be
pass
along
in
the
human
race
for
million
of
year
i
have
never
see
this
will
to
live
demonstrate
the
way
i
do
now
here
he
lay
head
somewhat
up
the
room
brightly
lit
eye
close
no
oxygen
mask
mother
and
all
of
us
present
he
d
take
a
deep
breath
then
there
d
be
nothing
then
he
d
take
another
deep
breath
each
breath
during
those
last
few
minute
seem
to
come
harder
than
the
last
the
period
between
breath
become
longer
finally
he
take
a
long
breath
sort
of
a
shudder
breath
and
it
go
out
as
though
to
say
that
s
it
all
the
care
of
the
world
have
depart
and
he
never
breathe
again
we
sat
there
a
few
moment
mother
start
to
cry
i
guess
we
be
all
cry
the
nurse
come
and
then
the
doctor
who
felt
his
pulse
and
say
he
be
dead

think
i
go
back
to
my
office
with
my
brother
to
check
on
the
funeral
arrangement
dick

i
have
agree

to
make
the
funeral
as
well
run
as

t
offer

the

t
haggle
about

a
big
load
off
my
mind
she

plenty
of
time
before
she
have
to
get
out
and
my
sister
take
her
to
spain
and
ireland
as
a
diversion
i
visit
her
for
six
day
in
ireland
and
found
her
in
remarkably
good
spirit
she
be
stay
near
ashford
castle
in
a
lovely
part
of
the
country
and
she
d
rent
an
old
fashion
high
back
bentley
with
a
chauffeur
a
very
articulate
irishman
whom
she
get
along
with
well
as
always
mother
want
to
see
everything
and
learn
local
history
so
each
day
they
d
sally
forth
into
the
countryside
she
be
particularly
take
with
the
beautiful
ten
foot
stone
wall
that
surround
some
of
the
building
built
by
the
british
and
she
point
them
out
for
me
to
admire
the
chauffeur
say
you
have
to
remember
ma
be
that
during
the
famine
a
man
would
work
a
full
day
for
a
bowl
of
soup
and
that
be
how
these
fence
get
built
my
own
grandfather
have
flee
from
that
famine
and
mother
say
less
about
the
stonework
after
that
when
i
come
back
to
new
york
i
try
go
to
the
office
but
i
found
myself
too
upset
to
work
everything
about
ibm
remind
me
of
dad
i
d
spent
four
year
rearrange
the
place
so
i
could
run
it
instead
of
him
but
that
make
no
difference
i
decide
the
only
medicine
strong
enough
to
make
me
forget
all
this
would
be
to
spend
time
with
my
own
son
i
decide
to
take
him
away
for
a
week
and
i
picked
alaska
because
i
thought
it
would
be
thrill
for
tom
i
want
to
give
him
something
to
remember
i
want
to
take
him
to
the
edge
of
civilization
and
show
him
glacier
and
mountain
and
the
bering
strait
where
i
d
come
across
from
russia
in
a
soviet
cargo
plane
when
his
mother
and
i
have
only
be
married
a
year
before
i
left
one
of
our
director
come
to
see
me
he
be
gilbert
scribner
the
senior
partner
in
a
chicago
real
estate
company
and
a
man
of
influence
scribner
be
head
of
our
compensation
committee
and
he
say
to
me
what
do
you
want
to
be
paid
it
hadn
t
occur
to
me
that
we
would
have
such
a
discussion
i
expect
to
be
paid
what
my
old
man
be
paid
i
say
well
gilbert
equal
pay
for
equal
work
i
want
precisely
what
my
father
get
with
the
same
profit
share
he
say
your
father
start
this
business
from
nothing
he
have
to
go
out
and
call
on
bank
he
have
to
really
do
thing
this
make
me
furious
i
say
dad
have
be
less
active
in
recent
year
and
we
be
sustain
growth
here
of
sixteen
percent
i
take
it
that
s
what
you
director
want
to
have
continue
he
say
he
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
committee
it
be
a
very
tough
position
to
be
put
in
with
dad
just
dead
but
i
thought
that
to
start
in
by
be
a
patsy
would
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
manage
the
board
it
never
even
occur
to
me
that
my
position
be
the
slightest
bit
unreasonable
i
be
affront
that
the
question
have
even
be
raise
and
i
left
for
alaska
without
wait
to
see
what
the
board
would
decide
tom
be
at
summer
camp
up
in
maine
i
get
a
plane
and
a
copilot
from
ibm
splitting
the
cost
with
the
company
because
i
be
planning
on
visit
our
alaska
office
we
picked
up
tom
and
his
friend
john
gaston
at
the
bar
harbor
airport
and
head
west
this
be
a
grueling
trip
to
make
in
a
small
plane
we
have
a
twin
engine
beechcraft
that
cruise
very
slowly
at
about
mile
an
hour
it
take
us
two
day
and
about
twenty
one
hour
of
flight
time
to
reach
canada
s
west
coast
i
be
concentrate
on
tom
and
his
friend
and
the
detail
of
fly
apart
from
that
my
mind
be
a
blank
i
never
thought
about
dad
for
the
entire
week
we
spent
in
alaska
but
my
sense
of
helplessness
and
grief
seep
through
in
a
hundred
way
as
i
saw
how
people
have
to
struggle
to
get
along
in
that
wild
place
the
argument
i
d
have
with
gilbert
scribner
also
gnawed
at
me
and
i
kept
call
al
williams
whenever
i
could
find
a
phone
the
first
place
we
stop
be
queen
charlotte
island
off
the
canadian
coast
i
want
to
show
tom
everything
i
could
and
that
island
have
a
big
lumber
operation
we
stayed
in
a
little
shack
hotel
run
by
the
lumber
company
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
how
a
living
tree
be
trim
and
use
as
a
derrick
to
lift
and
pile
its
neighbor
as
they
be
cut
then
we
flew
up
the
coast
get
some
fuel
and
take
the
plane
down
low
over
the
water
in
glacier
bay
i
didn
t
know
if
i
d
ever
get
an
opportunity
to
sail
up
that
way
but
we
simulated
it
in
the
airplane
it
be
a
beautiful
day
with
the
sun
come
off
the
glacier
and
mountain
and
the
water
be
full
of
jagged
ice
we
stayed
in
juneau
and
the
next
morning
we
go
out
and
saw
bear
scoop
salmon
out
of
a
nearby
river
i
remember
it
be
a
hot
summer
day
and
as
i
watch
the
bear
sit
on
their
tail
in
that
cool
water
i
thought
it
probably
felt
nice
but
there
be
something
melancholy
about
the
fish
the
guide
told
us
that
when
salmon
come
up
the
river
to
spawn
they
re
so
old
they
re
actually
fall
apart
they
re
decay
as
they
swim
they
get
up
there
somehow
lay
their
egg
and
die
i
couldn
t
have
picked
a
well
companion
for
this
trip
than
tom
who
have
inherit
olive
s
mildness
and
her
gift
for
sympathy
though
he
be
only
twelve
year
old
and
we
didn
t
directly
discus
dad
s
death
he
sense
the
crisis
i
be
go
through
and
have
him
there
be
a
tremendous
consolation
he
be
fascinate
by
wildlife
and
take
remarkable
picture
of
a
moose
during
one
of
the
side
trip
i
arrange
for
him
and
his
friend
while
i
flew
north
to
visit
our
sale
office
in
fairbanks
the
fairbanks
airport
have
a
display
of
mammoth
tusk
all
thousand
of
year
old
that
have
be
dug
out
of
the
tundra
the
local
ibm
manager
come
out
to
meet
me
and
he
brought
along
a
salesman
who
d
make
quite
a
good
record
up
there
the
wall
of
the
air
terminal
have
a
map
show
part
of
russia
i
be
so
proud
of
the
fact
that
i
d
be
there
that
i
guess
i
start
bragging
about
my
war
experience
and
how
we
d
be
strand
after
nearly
crash
our
plane
i
point
to
the
map
and
say
i
stayed
right
over
there
in
yakutsk
my
my
isn
t
that
interest
the
salesman
answer
in
a
very
sarcastic
way
like
some
of
the
other
ibm
people
i
met
in
alaska
this
fellow
have
grit
i
didn
t
get
mad
at
him
because
i
be
glad
to
have
the
hint
i
thought
i
d
well
slow
down
i
m
sound
like
a
loudmouth
we
have
a
meeting
that
night
at
a
restaurant
on
a
lake
i
remember
be
impressed
because
almost
every
house
on
the
lake
have
a
seaplane
moor
in
front
of
it
it
be
the
main
mean
of
transportation
in
this
part
of
alaska
at
the
meeting
be
maybe
fifteen
ibmers
mainly
from
railroad
and
defense
installation
and
some
of
them
have
brought
their
wife

only
one
room
and
a
section
have
be
curtain
off
for
us
everything
go
fine
until
it
come
time
for
my
speech
i
be
just
stand
up
when
a
floor
show
begin
on
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
it
be
a
song
and
dance
man
crack
joke
and
make
the
audience
laugh
i
look
at
the
local
manager
and
say
i
d
well
wait
till
that
guy
sits
down
no
he
say
all
these
people
be
busy
some
of
them
have
child

think

should
just
go
ahead
he
be
as
tough
with
me
as
the
salesman
have
be
i
want
to
say
god
i
can
t
do
that
but
it
be
one
of
those
thing
you
have
to
live
with
i
make
my
speech
damn
short
but
i
shout
that
entertainer
down
or
at
least
spoke
loud
enough
so
that
on
our
side
of
the
curtain
i
make
myself
heard
somehow
alaska
be
so
far
out
of
the
loop
that
the
fact
that
i
be
chief
executive
of
a
major
corporation
didn
t
seem
so
impressive
to
anybody
include
me
i
found
that
be
kind
of
a
relief
i
go
back
and
retrieve
the
boy
and
then
we
flew
across
the
divide
a
spine
of
mountain
that
cut
diagonally
across
the
state
we
need
fuel
and
stop
at
a
tiny
airstrip
where
i
pull
the
airplane
up
to
a
general
store
they
ran
a
hose
out
from
the
porch
and
fill
the
plane
with
gas
it
struck
me
that
this
be
the
remotest
place
i
d
be
since
siberia
i
want
to
go
all
the
way
up
to
point
barrow
the
northernmost
town
in
the
united
state
but
the
air
force
be
building
the
distant
early
warn
radar
line
and
the
airport
there
be
already
full
we
have
to
turn
back
at
kotzebue
on
the
bering
strait
just
above
the
arctic
circle
i
be
able
to
get
the
airplane
high
enough
so
that
we
could
see
the
soviet
island
of
little
diomede
and
big
diomede
not
far
from
anadyr
the
last
place
i
d
stop
in
siberia
during
the
war
i
told
tom
all
about
it
we
flew
back
to
nome
two
hundred
mile
to
the
south
and
spent
two
night
at
a
hotel
with
a
restaurant

the
bering
sea
caf
i
get
to

the
young
man
who
ran

he
and
his
wife
ate
dinner
with
us
the
first
night
and
he

the
boy

big
as
saucer
oh

but
what
ll
we
do
it
with
the
hotelkeeper
peel
five
buck
off
a
wad
of
cash
and
say

the
street
and
bang
on
the
door
of
the
hardware
store

for
a
gold

tom
and
the
other
boy
make
a
beeline
to
the
store
and
get
a
gold
pan
the
next
day
the
hotelkeeper
take
us
way
out
in
the
country
we
saw
ptarmigan
which
be
a
beautiful
specie
of
grouse
that
life
in
cold
climate
they
re
unusual
because
they
have
feather
on
their
leg
right
down
to
their
claw
finally
we
get
to
a
place
where
a
man
and
his
wife
be
work
a
claim
use
pressurize
water
and
a
sluice
as
we
drove
up
their
little
valley
we
must
have
pass
hundred
of
thousand
of
dollar
worth
of
abandon
tractor
trailer
water
pump
car
and
truck
we
found
the
guy
and
his
wife
sit
on
a
couple
of
box
with
an
open
loaf
of
bread
and
some
peanut
butter
between
them
we
talk
a
bit
and
i
ask
how
their
operation
be
go
we
make
a
living
out
of
it
he
told
me
i
say
you
know
when
people
think
of
gold
mining
they
think
of
something
pretty
big
well
he
say
we
ve
go
through
a
lot
of
stuff
you
probably
pass
some
of
it
come
in
we
re
do
well
enough
now
and
we
have
one
decent
truck
we
can
go
down
to
seattle
for
the
winter
he
be
still
evade
my
real
question
no
i
say
i
mean
have
you
make
any
money
they
really
hadn
t
they
be
still
hop
to
hit
that
big
nugget
meanwhile
tom
and
his
friend
found
gold
in
the
stream
tiny
fleck
of
it
we
take
a
piece
of
scotch
tape
and
taped
them
to
a
card
so
we
could
see
them
when
we
drove
away
i
be
think
of
the
futility
of
the
life
this
man
and
his
wife
have
eat
their
way
up
this
bank
take
a
little
gold
out
buying
a
truck
bring
the
truck
back
wear
it
out
let
it
rot
find
a
little
more
gold
buying
another
truck
and
so
on
by
the
end
of
seven
day
we
be
all
exhaust
we
spent
the
last
night
in
a
hotel
in
anchorage
and
i
found
tom
s
friend
john
cry
in
his
bed
the
boy
be
homesick
i
felt
frustrate
and
helpless
i
couldn
t
bring
the
boy
s
mother
to
him
he
have
no
father
his
mother
be
a
widow
and
i
couldn
t
get
him
to
his
mother
so
the
situation
be
just
impossible
the
next
day
we
left
for
home
we
flew
straight
from
anchorage
to
new
york
in
twenty
two
hour
i
don
t
know
how
the
copilot
and
i
stood
it
we
flew
home
so
rapidly
that
tom
and
john
have
fresh
trout
to
take
to
their
mother
we
d
bought
a
mess
of
fish
in
anchorage
just
before
leave
the
compensation
committee
finally
met
in
september
after
i
be
back
in
new
york
they
agree
i
should
be
paid
the
same
as
dad
soon
afterward
gil
scribner
come
and
say
i
suppose
you
be
go
to
want
my
resignation
not
at
all
i
say
ever
since
your
father
put
me
on
this
board
i
say
gilbert
look
my
father
didn
t
put
you
on
the
board
i
put
you
on
the
board
everything
that
happens
around
here
get
attribute
to
my
father
but
i
met
you
on
the
mutual
life
insurance
board
and
admire
you
greatly
and
you
be
very
kind
to
me
even
though
i
be
a
newcomer
when
dad
ask
me
to
suggest
someone
as
a
director
from
chicago
i
give
him
your
name
my
tell
him
this
heal
the
rift
between
us
and
scribner
remain
a
value
board
member
for
many
year
fear
of
failure
become
the
most
powerful
force
in
my
life
i
think
anybody
who
get
a
job
like
mine
unless
he
s
stupid
must
be
a
little
bit
afraid
there
be
such
a
long
way
to
fall
yet
the
fear
i
felt
when
i
go
back
to
ibm
take
me
totally
by
surprise
before
dad
die
i
be
run
the
business
and
even
chafe
at
not
get
full
credit
because
he
be
around
i
didn
t
realize
how
much
i
still
need
him
emotionally
i
remember
stand
in
the
corridor
outside
my
office
soon
after
i
come
back
from
alaska
look
dumbly
up
the
stair
that
lead
to
his
except
for
dick
s
operation
at
world
trade
the
weight
of
ibm
be
now
all
on
me
if
dad
hadn
t
die
i
could
have
be
chief
executive
for
year
and
never
felt
so
burden
i
decide
it
would
be
foolish
to
act
as
though
i
could
totally
take
his
place
rather
than
move
into
his
big
wood
panel
suite
i
kept
my
own
office
downstairs
and
ran
ibm
from
there
later
we
turn
his
office
into
a
library
i
retire
his
title
of
chairman
keep
the
one
he
have
give
me
president
there
be
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
his
seat
on
the
board
i
solve
that
by
ask
mother
to
join
she
have
be
at
dad
s
side
for
so
long
that
many
ibm
people
felt
a
personal
loyalty
toward
her
that
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
the
bad
thing
that
can
happen
when
a
leader
dy
be
for
his
follower
to
lose
their
inspiration
and
carry
on
like
robot
i
move
as
fast
as
i
could
to
prevent
that
so
before
the
year
be
out
i
call
the
top
one
hundred
or
so
executive
to
a
conference
at
williamsburg
virginia
and
distribute
power
and
responsibility
even
more
broadly
than
before
in
three
day
we
transform
ibm
so
completely
that
almost
nobody
left
that
meeting
with
the
same
job
he
have
when
he
arrive
i
picked
williamsburg
because
it
be
a
historic
place
and
this
meeting
be
meant
to
be
a
kind
of
constitutional
convention
for
the
new
ibm
almost
everybody
come
know
a
few
detail
of
what
we
be
about
to
do
and
you
could
feel
the
anticipation
and
excitement
in
that
rent
conference
room
after
the
tumultuous
event
that
have
already
take
place
that
year
the
settle
of
our
antitrust
case
my
promotion
to
chief
executive
and
dad
s
death
everybody
felt
that
this
be
the
takeoff
point
it
be
the
first
major
meeting
ibm
have
ever
held
without
dad
present
and
we
knew
how
far
we
d
come
from
the
day
of
his
hundred
percent
club
meeting
with
their
circus
tent
and
banner
and
song
of
the
old
guard
george
phillips
be
the
only
one
at
williamsburg
and
he
be
schedule
to
retire
the
follow
month
there
be
a
lot
of
young
men
and
one
young
woman
my
age
and
experience
be
typical
of
the
people
present
i
be
forty
two
and
i
d
be
in
management
barely
a
decade
what
we
create
be
not
so
much
a
reorganization
as
the
first
top
to
bottom
organization
ibm
ever
have
it
be
largely
the
work
of
dick
bullen
the
young
mba
i
d
name
as
organizational
architect
the
previous
year
under
his
plan
we
take
the
product
division
that
we
d
already
establish
tighten
them
up
so
that
each
executive
have
clearly
define
task
and
then
turn
the
unit
loose
to
operate
with
considerable
flexibility
these
be
ibm
s
arm
and
leg
so
to
speak
at
the
head
of
the
corporation
to
oversee
plan
and
major
decision
we
set
up
a
six
man
corporate
management
committee
that
consist
of
me
williams
lamotte
my
brother
miller
and
learson
i
give
each
man
responsibility
for
a
major
piece
of
ibm
while
leave
myself
free
to
roam
across
the
whole
company
finally
we
superimpose
a
corporate
staff
that
include
expert
in
such
area
as
finance
manufacturing
personnel
and
communication
their
task
be
to
work
as
a
kind
of
nervous
system
and
keep
our
adolescent
company
from
trip
all
over
itself
as
have
happen
a
few
month
earlier
when
we
have
two
division
unwittingly
bidding
against
each
other
on
the
same
tract
of
land
for
a
factory
by
the
mid
s
just
about
every
big
corporation
have
adopt
this
so
call
staff
and
line
structure
it
be
model
on
military
organization
go
back
to
the
prussian
army
in
napoleonic
time
in
this
sort
of
arrangement
line
manager
be
like
field
commander
their
duty
be
to
hit
production
target
beat
sale
quota
and
capture
market
share
meanwhile
the
staff
be
the
equivalent
of
general
aide
they
give
advice
to
their
superior
transmit
policy
from
headquarters
to
the
organization
handle
the
intricacy
of
planning
and
coordination
and
check
to
make
sure
that
the
division
attack
the
right
objective
du
pont
and
general
motor
begin
apply
this
system
to
business
as
early
as
the
s
but
to
the
ibmers
at
williamsburg
in
it
be
a
revolution
everybody
in
that
conference
room
have
be
train
under
my
father
in
exactly
the
same
way
we
d
all
start
out
as
salesman
and
we
d
all
be
mold
as
line
manager
the
phrase
you
heard
about
a
successful
ibm
executive
be
he
know
how
to
get
the
donkey
over
the
hill
we
all
knew
how
to
get
the
donkey
over
the
hill
but
when
it
come
to
think
about
which
hill
or
whether
it
might
be
wiser
to
go
down
and
around
a
hill
rather
than
up
and
over
we
tend
to
be
as
stupid
as
donkey
ourselves
when
the
meeting
convene
i
give
a
little
speech
say
that
time
have
change
we
ve
be
a
company
of
doer
now
we
must
learn
to
call
on
staff
and
rely
on
their
ability
to
think
out
answer
to
many
of
our
complex
problem
we
then
create
the
staff
right
before
their
eye
there
be
dozen
of
slot
to
be
fill
and
since
ibm
have
very
few
specialist
on
the
payroll
we
make
our
expert
simply
by
name
people
to
the
job
williams
and
i
have
reject
the
idea
of
recruiting
outsider
except
in
highly
specialized
field
such
as
law
and
science
we
d
spent
year
weed
out
dad
s
yes
men
and
replace
them
with
fierce
strong
will
decision
maker
if
we
d
hire
a
bunch
of
professor
or
consultant
to
come
in
and
play
staff
against
these
people
the
newcomer
would
have
be
eat
alive
instead
i
put
ibm
s
best
executive
in
the
new
job
start
with
al
as
chief
of
staff
it
be
a
huge
sacrifice
to
move
him
outside
the
chain
of
command
and
for
al
it
meant
swap
a
position
in
which
he
have
twenty
five
thousand
people
work
for
him
to
one
in
which
he
be
bos
of
only
eleven
hundred
but
by
shift
our
star
into
the
staff
we
enable
it
to
command
the
respect
of
the
division
and
that
be
the
key
to
make
the
whole
thing
work
the
great
strength
of
the
williamsburg
plan
be
that
it
provide
our
executive
with
the
clearest
possible
goal
each
operating
man
be
judged
strictly
on
his
unit
s
result
and
each
staff
man
on
his
effort
toward
make
ibm
the
world
leader
in
his
specialty
so
on
every
operating
proposal
we
have
financial
men
demand
to
know
how
it
would
improve
profit
public
relation
men
fight
to
make
sure
it
enhance
ibm
s
image
and
manufacturing
men
insist
that
we
maintain
the
high
productivity
in
our
plant
and
quality
in
our
product
when
the
conference
come
to
an
end
after
a
couple
of
day
of
workshop
there
be
no
doubt
that
ibm
have
be
totally
transform
to
underline
that
fact
we
ran
a
special
issue
of
the
company
newspaper
feature
the
first
organization
chart
ibm
ever
have
oddly
i
have
no
feel
at
all
that
we
be
go
against
dad
i
didn
t
think
he
d
have
be
alarmed
by
anything
we
do
if
i
could
have
ask
him
how
do
you
want
this
thing
run
his
answer
would
probably
have
be
i
don
t
know
son
it
be
get
so
big
when
i
left
that
i
could
hardly
understand
it
do
whatever
you
think
be
right
that
be
the
mandate
i
thought
i
have
not
a
day
go
by
when
i
didn
t
think
about
the
old
boy
but
the
only
thing
i
really
worried
about
be
lousing
the
business
up
my
friend
al
never
work
harder
in
his
life
than
he
do
whip
ibm
s
new
staff
into
shape
he
have
to
take
men
of
action
and
turn
them
into
men
of
thought
there
be
thirteen
people
reporting
directly
to
him
and
he
be
work
sixteen
hour
a
day
six
or
seven
day
a
week
the
first
thing
he
do
be
try
to
teach
them
to
write
a
good
staff
report
be
suppose
to
be
intelligible
and
direct
it
should
lay
out
a
problem
concisely
and
end
with
a
clear
recommendation
so
that
all
top
management
have
to
do
be
read
it
and
say
go
ahead
or
don
t
al
told
the
staff
you
have
to
pay
attention
to
this
write
stuff
remember
you
re
go
to
hand
it
to
a
senior
manager
and
he
have
to
understand
it
if
he
approves
your
recommendation
he
s
go
to
hand
the
report
to
somebody
else
to
carry
it
out
and
that
person
have
to
understand
it
too
this
advice
didn
t
take
after
six
month
the
report
be
still
so
chaotic
and
obtuse
that
al
get
desperate
he
call
the
staff
together
and
show
them
a
manila
folder
every
time
one
of
you
hand
me
a
sloppy
report
he
say
i
m
go
to
take
a
folder
like
this
and
put
your
report
in
the
left
hand
pocket
then
i
m
go
to
rewrite
it
the
way
you
should
have
do
it
in
the
first
place
and
put
that
in
the
right
hand
pocket
then
i
m
go
to
circulate
the
folder
to
each
man
in
this
room
after
that
if
somebody
do
a
lousy
job
his
twelve
associate
saw
it
the
quality
of
the
write
work
go
up
dramatically
al
constantly
have
to
arbitrate
dispute
between
the
staff
and
the
line
a
typical
headache
be
that
when
any
of
the
staff
men
spot
something
wrong
in
a
division
he
d
revert
to
be
a
man
of
action
and
fire
off
a
blistering
memo
dictate
what
ought
to
be
do
this
would
cause
the
division
executive
to
howl
that
the
staff
be
try
to
interfere
the
staff
also
developed
the
bad
habit
of
drag
their
foot
on
project
they
didn
t
like
al
must
have
lecture
his
men
a
hundred
time
quit
act
like
bureaucrat
you
ve
get
to
facilitate
thing
not
block
thing
in
the
month
lead
up
to
williamsburg
al
and
dick
bullen
have
spent
many
hour
discuss
how
to
transform
the
natural
tension
between
the
staff
and
the
line
into
energy
that
would
move
ibm
forward
rather
than
friction
that
would
slow
us
down
the
organizational
solution
they
finally
come
up
with
be
as
simple
and
brilliant
as
the
transistor
a
check
and
balance
scheme
that
eventually
become
famous
as
the
ibm
system
of
contention
management
not
only
do
it
make
staff
versus
line
conflict
acceptable
it
actually
encourage
them
in
this
system
no
operating
plan
at
ibm
be
final
without
a
staff
man
s
concurrence
and
if
he
sign
his
job
be
just
as
much
at
stake
as
the
executive
s
who
make
the
plan
when
an
executive
and
a
staff
man
couldn
t
agree
the
problem
automatically
would
get
kick
upstairs
they
d
have
to
come
in
and
air
their
difference
before
the
corporate
management
committee
which
do
not
suffer
indecisiveness
gladly
this
be
enough
to
make
our
executive
hammer
out
all
but
the
thorniest
problem
among
themselves
while
it
force
major
problem
to
surface
quickly
for
top
management
to
see
with
so
much
contention
built
in
why
do
the
new
system
work
for
one
thing
every
ibm
employee
have
job
security
date
back
to
the
day
when
dad
have
refuse
to
fire
people
during
the
depression
if
a
man
prove
ineffectual
at
his
new
assignment
he
wasn
t
go
to
be
put
out
on
the
street
instead
we
d
reassign
him
to
a
level
where
he
could
perform
well
in
do
this
we
would
sometimes
strip
a
man
of
a
fair
amount
of
dignity
but
we
would
then
make
a
great
effort
to
rebuild
his
self
respect
we
also
abide
by
the
ibm
custom
of
promotion
from
within
as
inexperienced
as
our
executive
might
be
in
their
new
job
they
have
all
come
up
from
the
bottom
and
knew
what
ibm
stood
for
as
well
as
they
knew
their
own
name
money
be
another
reason
the
contention
system
work
on
one
occasion
i
be
rant
in
a
management
committee
meeting
about
something
i
hope
something
worthwhile
and
a
rather
sarcastic
and
outspoken
fellow
from
my
office
name
tom
buckley
lean
over
to
spike
beitzel
later
a
senior
vice
president
and
ask
do
you
know
why
they
all
take
this
bunk
from
him
beitzel
who
be
anxious
not
to
attract
my
attention
just
then
shrug
buckley
say
because
they
re
all
get
filthy
rich
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
reward
the
people
ibm
count
on
most
not
only
be
there
lucrative
stock
option
for
those
near
the
top
but
before
be
over
i
met
with
the
board
and
quietly
set
up
a
unique
incentive
plan
it
involve
my
father
s
pay
which
now
of
course
be
my
pay
he
d
always
take
a
salary
plus
a
percentage
of
the
profit
and
when
he
die
i
d
make
a
great
point
of
fight
to
keep
that
arrangement
intact
for
myself
but
after
williamsburg
it
no
longer
fit
if
anyone
have
a
right
to
a
percentage
of
the
profit
it
wasn
t
watson
but
the
watson
team
my
cut
of
ibm
s
profit
that
year
be
one
fourth
of
one
percent
after
dividend
or
i
split
it
with
williams
and
lamotte
let
them
apportion
the
money
in
a
way
they
decide
be
fair
and
it
work
out
so
that
my
own
pay
be
only
two
third
of
what
it
would
have
be
in
subsequent
year
we
take
the
same
money
and
distribute
even
more
broadly
to
the
thirteen
top
men
this
arrangement
have
a
powerful
symbolic
effect
because
it
prove
that
the
one
man
show
be
over
from
then
on
i
manage
ibm
with
a
team
of
fifteen
or
twenty
senior
executive
some
of
these
men
be
my
friend
but
i
never
hesitate
to
promote
people
i
didn
t
like
the
comfortable
assistant
the
nice
guy
you
like
to
go
on
fishing
trip
with
be
a
great
pitfall
in
management
instead
i
be
always
look
for
sharp
scratchy
harsh
almost
unpleasant
guy
who
could
see
and
tell
me
about
thing
as
they
really
be
if
you
can
get
enough
of
those
around
you
and
have
patience
enough
to
hear
them
out
there
be
no
limit
to
where
you
can
go
my
most
important
contribution
to
the
company
be
my
ability
to
pick
strong
and
intelligent
men
for
these
slot
and
then
hold
the
team
together
by
persuasion
by
apology
by
speech
by
discipline
by
chat
with
their
wife
by
thoughtfulness
when
they
be
sick
or
involve
in
accident
and
by
use
every
tool
at
my
command
to
make
each
man
think
i
be
a
decent
guy
i
knew
i
couldn
t
match
all
of
them
intellectually
but
i
thought
that
if
i
use
fully
every
capability
that
i
have
i
could
stay
even
with
them
i
be
pretty
harsh
and
scratchy
myself
i
want
all
the
executive
of
ibm
to
feel
the
urgency
i
felt
whatever
they
do
it
be
never
enough
i
be
a
volatile
leader
perhaps
even
more
volatile
than
dad
and
i
justified
this
by
tell
myself
that
i
be
never
harder
on
any
of
my
men
than
he
have
be
on
me
only
gradually
do
i
learn
the
virtue
of
restraint
we
have
an
executive
in
those
day
name
dave
moore
a
ruddy
face
two
fisted
guy
i
d
know
grow
up
our
family
have
be
friendly
like
his
father
before
him
dave
be
manager
of
our
international
time
record
division
which
mainly
sell
factory
time
clock
and
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
company
s
origin
up
through
the
s
it
have
be
one
of
ibm
s
strong
unit
but
after
the
war
when
the
idea
of
looser
more
flexible
factory
management
come
along
the
time
clock
become
a
symbol
of
the
sweatshop
not
only
be
this
bad
for
ibm
s
image
but
a
lot
of
company
simply
quit
use
them
the
division
become
stagnant
and
its
profit
fell
because
there
be
a
lot
of
time
clock
maker
and
they
be
all
compete
for
a
small
and
small
pie
moore
do
his
best
to
turn
the
situation
around
but
year
after
year
the
result
be
poor
finally
williams
and
i
decide
moore
have
to
be
replace
we
promise
him
an
equivalent
job
at
the
same
salary
but
dave
be
stun
he
sought
out
his
immediate
bos
red
lamotte
and
say
well
i
ve
make
a
success
of
the
time
division
haven
t
i
of
course
if
it
have
be
a
success
we
wouldn
t
have
take
him
out
of
the
job
but
red
equivocate
be
a
gentle
man
when
i
heard
of
their
conversation
i
should
have
just
let
the
thing
ride
but
i
always
lose
my
temper
when
an
ibm
man
refuse
to
face
a
problem
squarely
i
call
moore
in
and
say
i
don
t
know
how
the
hell
you
can
say
thing
like
that
dave
let
s
be
realistic
the
time
equipment
business
be
go
nowhere
how
can
you
call
that
a
success
you
can
say
you
do
as
well
as
you
could
under
the
circumstance
but
do
you
make
money
do
your
division
move
ahead
no
you
be
not
a
success
he
left
the
meeting
and
my
word
fester
in
him
after
a
few
month
he
quit
sell
all
his
ibm
stock
and
take
a
civilian
job
in
the
air
force
i
ve
always
regret
drive
moore
out
especially
since
in
retrospect
it
s
clear
he
have
an
impossible
job
his
successor
couldn
t
turn
the
business
around
either
and
eventually
the
unit
be
sell
gradually
i
learn
to
control
myself
well
but
it
would
have
be
a
fatal
mistake
to
expect
perfect
harmony
at
ibm
you
can
t
run
a
business
well
simply
by
announce
tomorrow
we
re
go
to
do
a
and
friday
we
re
go
to
do
b
and
next
year
we
re
go
to
do
c
the
best
way
to
motivate
people
be
to
pit
them
against
one
another
and
i
be
constantly
look
for
way
to
stir
up
internal
competition
this
lead
me
a
few
year
after
williamsburg
to
one
of
my
most
controversial
decision
in
spite
of
all
our
effort
at
decentralization
the
data
processing
division
which
be
responsible
for
all
our
computer
and
punch
card
machine
be
just
too
big
it
be
in
danger
of
become
clumsy
and
bureaucratic
so
i
assign
a
task
force
to
figure
out
a
way
to
break
it
into
manageable
part
they
come
back
to
me
after
a
month
and
say
it
s
impossible
it
s
all
one
business
there
s
no
way
to
divide
it
all
right
i
say
i
ll
do
it
for
you
all
product
that
rent
for
over
ten
thousand
dollar
a
month
will
belong
to
one
division
and
all
product
under
ten
thousand
dollar
will
belong
to
another
division
i
picked
ten
thousand
dollar
because
that
be
our
average
rental
price
and
it
make
the
two
camp
roughly
equal
with
about
thirty
thousand
employee
each
but
apart
from
that
it
be
a
very
awkward
split
it
essentially
broke
our
computer
business
into
compete
half
the
corporate
staff
have
a
terrible
time
figure
out
how
to
divvy
up
our
laboratory
factory
and
sale
force
between
the
two
new
unit
i
didn
t
think
we
be
smart
enough
to
manage
ibm
any
other
way
from
then
on
we
didn
t
have
to
depend
on
the
brilliance
of
top
management
to
decide
what
need
to
be
change
when
you
have
separate
unit
compete
against
one
another
to
a
large
extent
they
discipline
themselves
the
new
arrangement
put
the
hot
breath
of
competition
into
every
division
executive
s
ear
and
we
could
gauge
ibm
s
efficiency
by
compare
one
division
with
the
other
i
could
go
to
the
head
of
the
data
system
division
and
instead
of
say
gee
be
you
sure
your
overhead
cost
be
reasonable
i
could
say
how
come
the
overhead
in
the
general
product
division
be
low
than
yours
or
why
do
it
take
you
four
year
to
develop
a
computer
while
it
only
take
general
product
two
year
to
develop
a
roughly
comparable
machine
much
of
the
time
it
wasn
t
even
necessary
to
ask
procter
gamble
be
do
something
like
this
with
consumer
product
they
d
develop
two
or
three
brand
of
detergent
and
let
them
compete
against
each
other
in
the
grocery
store
and
of
course
general
motor
sell
several
different
line
of
car
but
it
be
radical
think
to
apply
internal
conflict
to
the
degree
ibm
do
a
lot
of
people
told
me
it
would
never
work
but
it
be
one
of
the
secret
of
how
we
get
as
big
as
we
do
the
williamsburg
organization
come
none
too
soon
because
ibm
s
growth
be
accelerate
the
business
grow
faster
in
the
two
year
after
dad
s
death
than
ever
in
its
history
except
the
wartime
expansion
of
once
we
won
the
number
race
against
remington
rand
the
psychology
of
the
market
swung
completely
in
our
favor
even
though
computer
be
the
most
complicate
and
expensive
business
tool
anyone
have
ever
see
customer
be
decide
they
couldn
t
be
without
them
they
picked
ibm
because
of
our
reputation
for
both
machine
and
service
we
have
the
salesman
and
technician
who
knew
how
to
provide
system
that
work
score
of
expert
who
could
unravel
tough
program
problem
and
a
huge
library
of
computer
program
we
offer
to
customer
at
no
charge
get
a
computer
be
a
major
investment
that
require
approval
by
the
board
of
director
in
most
company
and
for
the
executive
in
charge
of
pick
the
right
machine
ibm
become
know
as
the
safe
choice
as
fortune
magazine
put
it
at
the
time
board
of
director
may
know
little
about
machinery
but
they
know
about
ibm
although
we
be
have
success
after
success
i
worried
about
whether
we
could
hang
onto
the
advantage
we
d
gain
rca
be
come
into
the
industry
and
i
thought
they
be
go
to
be
terribly
tough
on
the
other
hand
al
williams
always
believe
the
most
serious
competition
would
come
from
general
electric
which
around
that
time
land
a
huge
contract
to
computerize
the
retail
banking
operation
of
bank
of
america
ge
be
a
smart
company
well
organize
and
when
they
take
hold
of
something
like
jet
engine
or
even
dishwasher
they
really
do
it
thoroughly
in
the
mid
s
rca
be
half
again
as
big
as
we
be
and
ge
be
five
time
our
size
if
either
company
have
decide
to
hire
away
some
of
our
best
people
and
commit
large
amount
of
money
to
this
thing
they
would
have
wipe
us
off
the
map
shortly
after
dad
die
while
we
be
still
planning
for
williamsburg
i
be
summon
over
to
rca
to
see
general
david
sarnoff
rca
have
be
experiment
with
computer
since
the
s
and
have
just
deliver
a
giant
machine
call
bizmac
to
the
u
s
tank
arsenal
in
detroit
where
it
be
use
to
keep
track
of
inventory
some
rca
executive
believe
computer
would
be
as
important
to
their
company
s
future
as
color
television
it
be
hard
for
me
not
to
feel
awe
stand
in
front
of
the
father
of
american
radio
and
television
the
general
be
a
short
man
but
he
sat
either
on
a
high
chair
or
on
a
platform
and
he
look
very
big
to
me
he
have
a
long
cigar
that
he
pull
at
sporadically
as
he
spoke
although
i
have
met
him
socially
this
be
a
different
general
sarnoff
he
say
he
want
license
under
our
computer
patent
and
he
thought
we
be
reluctant
to
make
them
available
even
though
we
be
require
to
do
so
under
our
new
consent
decree
he
told
me
that
the
expertise
that
produce
rca
s
tv
set
could
also
be
use
for
computer
and
that
he
intend
to
capitalize
on
that
i
didn
t
let
my
feel
of
awe
stop
me
from
point
out
that
computer
be
a
highly
specialized
market
more
dependent
on
sale
and
system
expertise
than
hardware
i
say
that
while
we
would
license
him
any
patent
he
want
i
thought
he
would
have
a
difficult
time
in
the
computer
business
meanwhile
one
of
the
people
help
us
get
ready
for
williamsburg
be
a
management
consultant
name
john
l
burn
i
knew
burn
casually
a
big
heavyset
harvard
ph
d
who
have
start
his
career
during
the
depression
as
a
laborer
in
a
steel
mill
and
have
risen
to
senior
partner
in
the
consult
firm
of
booz
allen
hamilton
when
i
d
ask
him
to
work
with
ibm
burn
have
explain
he
be
a
top
consultant
to
rca
and
would
have
to
get
their
permission
then
he
accepted
and
work
quite
intimately
with
us
until
williamsburg
not
more
than
three
month
after
the
conference
burn
telephone
and
say
that
sarnoff
be
offering
to
make
him
president
of
rca
he
ask
if
i
have
any
objection
i
say
i
most
certainly
do
john
because
we
have
entrust
him
with
detailed
knowledge
of
our
organization
and
method
and
plan
nevertheless
he
take
the
job
the
threat
pose
by
burn
would
have
be
much
more
grave
have
i
not
paid
attention
to
some
advice
i
get
from
al
williams
al
have
telephone
one
day
to
tell
me
that
booz
allen
s
team
be
ask
for
an
explanation
of
ibm
s
pricing
practice
sure
i
say
it
s
like
your
doctor
you
have
to
tell
them
everything
but
williams
insist
it
be
unwise
to
give
them
the
data
i
be
irritated
because
i
thought
highly
of
burn
but
i
always
make
a
point
of
listen
to
al
so
i
say
all
right
if
you
feel
that
strongly
don
t
tell
them
the
pricing
practice
have
be
built
up
since
the
early
day
of
ibm
behind
the
price
of
each
rental
product
we
have
our
own
cost
of
marketing
cost
of
service
and
rate
of
plan
obsolescence
all
carefully
kept
secret
in
burn
s
hand
this
knowledge
would
have
enable
rca
to
aim
where
ibm
s
product
line
be
weak
and
avoid
attack
where
we
be
strong
and
could
cut
price
to
fend
off
competitor
we
try
to
make
sure
that
for
well
finance
rival
like
ge
and
rca
the
computer
business
seem
too
risky
a
bet
we
do
this
by
make
ourselves
tremendously
sensitive
to
toehold
the
feel
among
our
sale
force
be
that
if
a
general
electric
could
get
five
percent
it
could
get
percent
if
a
salesman
lose
a
customer
without
have
first
alert
management
that
the
account
be
in
jeopardy
he
be
subject
to
discipline
ibm
salesman
have
two
type
of
call
report
to
fill
out
the
first
be
routine
the
second
be
name
special
account
report
and
come
in
two
color
pink
one
be
for
situation
where
ibm
be
bidding
against
somebody
else
to
win
a
new
customer
yellow
slip
represent
sick
account
where
a
customer
be
dissatisfied
these
report
be
compile
and
exhaustively
analyze
by
geographical
location
by
customer
type
and
by
product
type
couple
with
other
research
the
special
account
report
enable
us
to
ass
accurately
how
the
competition
be
do
any
inroad
make
by
a
competitor
like
rca
be
worrisome
in
an
industry
explode
like
ours
it
be
one
of
my
unwavering
conviction
that
gain
and
hold
market
position
be
crucial
any
deviation
from
this
goal
in
an
attempt
to
maximize
short
term
profit
would
over
the
long
term
reduce
the
total
amount
of
our
profit
by
the
same
token
to
try
to
pick
and
choose
a
limited
number
of
area
in
which
to
be
strong
be
a
foolish
and
dangerous
course
if
we
be
to
do
that
we
would
limit
the
scale
of
our
business
make
it
easy
for
competitor
across
the
board
i
believe
that
the
only
way
for
ibm
to
win
be
to
move
move
move
all
the
time
as
the
computer
industry
grow
we
have
to
grow
with
it
no
matter
how
fast
that
growth
might
be
i
never
varied
from
the
managerial
rule
that
the
bad
possible
thing
we
could
do
would
be
to
lie
dead
in
the
water
with
any
problem
solve
it
solve
it
quickly
solve
it
right
or
wrong
if
you
solve
it
wrong
it
would
come
back
and
slap
you
in
the
face
and
then
you
could
solve
it
right
lie
dead
in
the
water
and
do
nothing
be
a
comfortable
alternative
because
it
be
without
immediate
risk
but
it
be
an
absolutely
fatal
way
to
manage
a
business
so
i
never
hesitate
to
intervene
if
i
saw
the
company
get
bogged
down
a
few
month
after
williamsburg
we
be
have
a
dreadful
time
move
over
to
transistor
the
transistor
be
obviously
the
wave
of
the
future
in
electronics
it
be
faster
than
the
vacuum
tube
generate
less
heat
and
have
great
potential
for
miniaturization
nobody
be
sell
transistorize
computer
yet
but
a
great
many
company
be
race
to
perfect
them
include
rca
honeywell
control
data
ncr
and
philco
we
too
be
experiment
with
transistorize
computer
and
calculator
in
our
poughkeepsie
lab
early
transistor
be
unreliable
they
be
sensitive
to
heat
moisture
and
vibration
but
by
ralph
palmer
and
the
people
he
direct
at
poughkeepsie
have
do
enough
test
to
be
sure
those
limitation
could
be
overcome
the
big
remain
hurdle
be
cost
transistor
be
sell
for
about
apiece
and
it
seem
impossible
to
design
a
computer
use
them
that
would
ever
make
any
money
but
birkenstock
as
usual
the
one
to
goad
me
in
technology
point
out
that
by
move
aggressively
we
could
make
this
difficulty
disappear

not
many
people
have
ever
heard
of
them
but
they
d
steal
a
march
on
big
vacuum

by

to
mass
manufacture
transistor
first
pat
haggerty
their
factory
chief
and
later
president
understood
the
unique
economics
of
the
transistor
game
well
than
anybody
else
when
texas
instrument
first
go
into
the
business
transistor
be
cost
up
to
sixteen
dollar
each
and
one
of
their
few
practical
application

in

figure
that
by
get
the
price
down
to
about
the
company
could
open
up
a
mass
market
in
portable
radio
they
gamble
two
million
dollar
on
a
circuit
design
and
production
process
to
meet
this
goal
and
in
the
transistor
radio
be
born
it
become
a
hit
with
consumer
and
put
texas
instrument
on
top
we
thought
similar
magic
might
work
for
ibm
by
design
computer
on
the
assumption
that
the
cost
of
transistor
could
be
push
down
still
far
to
perhaps
we
could
set
price
that
would
attract
customer
and
still
let
us
make
a
profit
birkenstock
flew
to
dallas
to
ask
texas
instrument
to
help
they
agree
to
build
a
factory
with
high
volume
production
line
that
would
cut
the
cost
of
transistor
so
dramatically
that
they
d
be
cheaper
than
the
high
grade
vacuum
tube
we
be
now
depend
on
in
turn
we
promise
to
use
the
lion
s
share
of
the
million
of
transistor
the
new
plant
would
produce
that
s
where
we
almost
bogged
down
this
bold
plan
give
us
an
incentive
to
transistorize
all
our
product
computer
and
punch
card
machine
alike
because
the
more
transistor
we
use
the
cheaper
they
d
be
while
the
idea
of
transistorization
delighted
the
computer
engineer
at
poughkeepsie
it
raise
a
storm
of
protest
from
the
punch
card
designer
up
in
endicott
they
have
barely
learn
to
handle
electron
in
a
tube
and
this
new
invention
shock
them
i
would
go
up
to
the
lab
and
say
why
not
transistor
hop
they
d
take
the
hint
but
for
month
every
new
design
they
sent
down
to
new
york
be
full
of
tube
finally
i
issue
a
memorandum
that
say
after
october
we
will
design
no
more
machine
use
vacuum
tube
sign
tom
watson
jr
the
endicott
people
be
awfully
mad
and
say
what
do
he
know
about
it
but
i
get
a
hundred
of
those
little
transistor
radio
texas
instrument
be
make
and
carry
a
few
along
whenever
i
go
to
endicott
each
time
i
heard
an
engineer
say
that
transistor
be
undependable
i
would
pull
a
radio
out
of
my
bag
and
challenge
him
to
wear
it
out
on
wall
street
ibm
be
a
darling
stock
broker
in
those
day
use
to
tout
promising
new
company
as
the
next
ibm
the
value
of
the
stock
have
multiply
fivefold
just
since
i
d
become
president
and
if
your
family
have
be
fortunate
enough
to
invest
in
a
hundred
share
during
the
year
that
my
father
take
over
the
business
by
that
stake
would
have
grown
to
million
a
big
event
on
wall
street
that
year
be
our
first
stock
sale
father
have
always
reject
the
idea
of
sell
new
share
but
it
finally
come
down
to
a
question
of
common
sense
we
d
borrow
as
much
as
you
could
borrow
we
owe
the
prudential
well
over
million
which
make
us
the
big
debtor
in
american
business
yet
at
the
rate
we
be
building
factory
and
rental
equipment
we
be
go
to
need
more
capital
a
lot
of
it
al
williams
calculate
that
we
could
easily
make
use
of
million
so
i
call
our
man
at
morgan
stanley
buck
ewing
up
to
that
moment
he
be
probably
the
most
underemployed
investment
banker
of
any
major
corporation
buck
and
i
have
flown
together
in
world
war
ii
and
after
the
war
morgan
stanley
have
assign
him
to
the
ibm
account
the
first
time
buck
have
call
to
ask
if
ibm
need
capital
i
told
him
i
don
t
think
my
father
be
ready
for
this
but
i
introduce
him
to
dad
all
the
same
they
chat
very
briefly
after
buck
left
dad
say
that
man
be
not
use
his
head
the
last
thing
we
want
to
do
be
sell
stock
the
head
of
morgan
stanley
be
perry
hall
whom
dad
knew
from
the
short
hill
episcopal
church
hall
be
sharp
he
have
listen
to
dad
s
view
on
sell
new
stock
once
and
have
never
raise
the
issue
again
buck
on
the
other
hand
call
on
us
each
year
and
it
finally
get
to
the
point
where
dad
who
admire
persistence
would
give
him
five
minute
and
talk
in
a
friendly
way
so
when
williams
and
i
decide
to
go
ahead
it
seem
reasonable
to
call
buck
he
come
rush
up
instantly
brought
a
whole
team
in
and
the
thing
get
do
morgan
stanley
s
name
appear
at
the
head
of
the
list
of
underwriter
which
be
quite
a
coup
because
million
be
the
second
large
stock
sale
in
wall
street
history
the
large
have
be
a
million
offering
by
general
motor
in
we
hit
the
billion
dollar
mark
at
the
end
of
my
first
full
year
as
chief
executive
sell
a
billion
dollar
worth
of
anything
in
those
day
be
like
supersonic
flight
there
weren
t
many
organization
that
have
achieve
it
only
thirty
six
american
industrial
company
such
as
procter
gamble
boeing
and
standard
oil
be
big
than
ibm
and
almost
all
of
them
depend
on
us
for
computer
it
no
longer
take
watson
optimism
to
say
we
be
a
significant
factor
in
the
u
s
economy
i
allow
myself
a
small
celebration
we
have
be
want
to
upgrade
our
corporate
airplane
so
we
bought
a
convair
a
twin
engine
fifty
passenger
airliner
that
we
fit
out
with
bunk
and
a
meeting
area
we
use
it
to
fly
customer
to
sale
demonstration
not
for
junket
but
all
the
same
it
be
heady
stuff
for
a
fellow
of
forty
three
to
buy
a
million
dollar
airplane
like
that
i
be
terribly
proud
of
the
start
i
d
make
i
didn
t
like
it
when
people
compare
me
to
my
father
but
i
felt
that
if
i
could
keep
my
record
go
for
perhaps
another
ten
year
i
d
be
able
to
count
myself
in
the
same
league
as
dad
so
it
come
as
a
real
slap
in
the
face
when
one
member
of
my
family
decide
to
hedge
her
bet
on
my
make
it
the
second
year
after
dad
die
my
sister
jane
sell
a
million
dollar
worth
of
ibm
stock
about
one
third
of
her
total
hold
this
be
a
real
vote
of
no
confidence
the
first
time
any
watson
have
ever
sell
ibm
stock
and
it
cut
me
so
deeply
that
i
go
down
to
her
house
in
washington
of
course
it
be
your
right
to
sell
whenever
you
want
i
told
her
but
why
do
you
do
it
jane
be
awfully
surprised
that
i
knew
about
the
sale
because
she
didn
t
understand
corporation
well
enough
to
realize
that
a
million
dollar
sale
be
report
to
the
chief
executive
but
get
an
answer
out
of
her
be
exactly
like
have
a
discussion
with
the
old
man
sometimes
when
you
try
to
pin
him
down
my
father
would
give
a
totally
ridiculous
answer
if
you
say
dad
you
picked
up
my
bag
and
left
me
at
the
station
his
answer
might
be
oh
i
thought
you
want
to
walk
home
that
s
the
kind
of
impossible
response
i
get
from
jane
i
didn
t
think
you
d
be
interested
how
can
you
possibly
think
that
i
ve
be
run
this
business
and
you
ve
be
a
beneficiary
of
it
but
you
ve
never
give
the
slightest
hint
that
you
think
this
record
be
worth
tip
a
hat
to
oh
tom
you
know
i
think
that
so
then
why
be
you
sell
your
stock
because
i
have
to
protect
my
family
s
future
in
retrospect
i
can
see
jane
be
probably
follow
the
advice
of
some
financial
counselor
who
convince
her
it
be
prudent
to
diversify
her
holding
but
at
the
time
her
sell
of
the
stock
really
knock
me
back
and
it
be
the
end
of
warm
feeling
between
us
for
a
number
of
year
management
be
no
science
it
be
much
too
human
a
process
ever
to
qualify
since
we
built
such
sophisticated
business
machine
people
tend
to
think
of
ibm
as
a
model
of
order
and
logic
a
totally
streamline
organization
in
which
we
developed
plan
rationally
and
carry
them
out
with
utter
precision
i
never
thought
for
a
minute
that
be
really
the
case
while
the
s
be
a
boom
time
for
such
field
as
organizational
engineering
and
system
analysis
that
be
not
the
kind
of
leadership
the
people
of
ibm
expect
or
the
job
for
which
i
d
be
train
dad
have
taught
me
that
a
good
businessman
have
to
be
an
actor
you
have
to
make
a
show
of
get
angry
a
lot
more
often
than
you
really
lose
your
temper
you
have
to
look
more
worried
than
you
really
be
when
try
to
stimulate
someone
to
tackle
a
problem
dad
be
a
master
at
ham
it
up
in
this
way
and
i
pattern
my
action
after
him
whenever
i
get
the
chance
as
ibm
become
huge
and
decentralize
the
challenge
be
to
find
way
of
maintain
personal
contact
with
the
people
of
the
company
and
to
motivate
other
top
executive
to
follow
my
example
one
july
an
airliner
carry
a
number
of
ibm
employee
turn
over
take
off
from
rochester
new
york
in
a
thunderstorm
seven
people
die
in
the
crash
include
one
ibmer
and
eight
or
nine
others
from
our
group
be
hospitalize
i
be
at
an
ibm
conference
in
vermont
when
word
of
the
accident
come
and
i
checked
quickly
to
make
sure
the
chief
of
the
division
involve
have
go
to
rochester
to
help
but
one
executive
be
still
in
his
westchester
office
i
get
him
on
the
phone
and
say
be
you
go
to
go
up
there
and
go
from
bed
to
bed
or
will
i
jeez
tom
i
never
thought
of
it
he
d
be
in
the
business
a
long
time
and
i
ask
how
he
could
possibly
have
forgotten
the
example
dad
have
set
after
the
port
jervis
train
wreck
in
get
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
drive
to
the
hospital
to
see
the
ibm
family
involve
i
m
give
you
fair
warn
i
say
you
re
suppose
to
run
your
division
as
if
it
be
your
own
company
but
if
you
re
not
in
rochester
by
the
end
of
today
i
m
go
myself
i
ll
call
you
from
the
hospital
he
say
and
he
do
about
four
hour
later
like
dad
i
go
to
dozen
of
family
dinner
for
ibm
employee
each
year
and
pay
visit
to
local
office
be
standard
procedure
for
me
on
any
business
trip
i
kept
a
whole
squad
of
secretary
busy
do
thing
in
the
same
way
dad
would
have
make
sure
every
letter
i
receive
be
acknowledge
within
forty
eight
hour
send
flower
to
the
hospitalize
wife
of
an
employee
and
make
thousand
of
other
small
gesture
of
thoughtfulness
dad
often
answer
his
own
phone
himself
and
so
do
i
whenever
i
could
if
the
caller
be
a
customer
it
be
a
delightful
surprise
to
reach
watson
directly
and
if
the
caller
be
an
ibmer
it
set
a
powerful
example
for
him
to
treat
his
own
caller
with
equal
consideration
probably
an
efficiency
expert
would
have
condemn
these
practice
as
a
gargantuan
waste
of
time
for
a
chief
executive
but
in
a
service
orient
business
like
ours
these
seemingly
minor
detail
of
courtesy
and
style
be
too
important
to
let
slide
if
the
head
man
stop
take
a
proprietary
interest
in
them
pretty
soon
everybody
else
stop
care
too
i
d
succeed
in
change
so
much
about
ibm
the
way
we
be
organize
the
technology
we
sell
the
actual
look
of
the
company
but
the
hardest
task
of
all
be
what
williams
and
i
call
rid
the
runaway
horse
keep
ibm
coherent
as
it
multiply
in
size
eventually
i
be
able
to
distill
into
a
simple
set
of
precept
the
philosophy
dad
have
follow
in
manage
the
business
for
forty
year
give
full
consideration
to
the
individual
employee
spend
a
lot
of
time
make
customer
happy
go
the
last
mile
to
do
a
thing
right
i
thought
that
to
survive
and
succeed
we
have
to
be
willing
to
change
everything
about
ibm
except
these
basic
belief
dad
have
always
conveyed
his
way
of
think
to
employee
by
personal
visit
speechmaking
and
the
sheer
force
of
his
personality
everyone
understood
his
value
so
well
that
apart
from
the
old
slogan
like
a
manager
be
an
assistant
to
his
men
he
never
get
around
to
codify
them
i
felt
compel
to
change
that
because
ibm
be
now
many
time
large
than
when
he
be
in
his
prime
and
because
we
be
hire
thousand
of
people
every
year
and
large
number
of
relatively
inexperienced
ibmers
be
be
promote
into
management
job
the
most
important
thing
for
these
young
manager
to
learn
be
not
the
professional
or
technical
dimension
of
their
work
but
the
proper
way
to
treat
the
people
who
report
to
them
dad
call
this
day
to
day
contact
the
man
manager
relationship
and
it
be
as
essential
to
ibm
as
the
family
be
to
society
we
depend
on
this
relationship
to
help
safeguard
respect
for
the
individual
no
matter
how
highly
structure
the
rest
of
the
business
become
as
long
as
worker
and
supervisor
understood
each
other
union
be
superfluous
at
ibm
but
if
we
let
that
bond
erode
sooner
or
later
the
business
be
sure
to
become
a
battleground
our
training
method
at
that
stage
be
still
surprisingly
primitive
we
have
our
sale
school
and
machine
school
but
nothing
to
teach
a
person
about
how
to
be
someone
s
bos
a
branch
manager
would
call
a
salesman
in
and
say
you
re
promote
to
assistant
manager
be
careful
with
people
don
t
swear
and
wear
a
white
shirt
around
the
time
of
the
williamsburg
conference
i
take
one
of
our
most
gift
sale
manager
tom
clemmons
and
put
him
in
charge
of
executive
development
he
start
a
program
that
be
taught
at
the
sleepy
hollow
country
club
at
first
he
be
use
case
straight
from
the
harvard
business
school
i
take
him
aside
one
day
and
say
in
my
usual
undiplomatic
way
that
if
our
company
be
really
go
to
be
unique
we
have
to
teach
something
unique
he
say
i
thought
you
want
them
educate
to
be
good
manager
you
don
t
understand
i
say
i
want
them
to
be
educate
in
ibm
management
communication
supreme
sale
and
service
effort
go
to
a
guy
s
house
if
his
wife
be
ill
and
see
if
you
can
help
out
make
post
death
call
you
couldn
t
read
that
in
anybody
else
s
manual
they
be
the
practice
we
d
built
up
over
the
year
and
new
ibm
manager
have
to
know
them
in
addition
to
the
technology
so
clemmons
change
direction
and
the
training
system
become
so
good
that
eventually
we
make
a
rule
that
people
could
not
manage
anything
in
ibm
unless
they
have
be
to
management
school
the
course
last
from
two
to
six
week
and
i
make
sure
that
i
or
another
top
executive
visit
each
group
of
trainee
that
go
through
because
it
be
crucial
for
them
to
see
who
they
be
work
for
i
never
thought
the
proper
place
for
a
senior
executive
be
sit
behind
a
bare
desk
look
at
the
ceiling
dream
up
great
deed
for
the
future
and
draw
new
line
on
the
organization
chart
i
spent
the
equivalent
of
at
least
one
day
per
week
on
employee
complaint
or
walk
through
plant
talk
to
salesman
and
chat
with
customer
i
ask
what
be
right
and
more
important
what
be
wrong
you
don
t
hear
thing
that
be
bad
about
your
company
unless
you
ask
it
be
easy
to
hear
good
tidings
but
you
have
to
scratch
to
get
the
bad
news
work
in
this
way
i
uncovered
shoddy
and
seamy
thing
in
ibm
that
we
be
able
to
fix
before
they
become
very
serious
in
for
example
one
of
our
branch
manager
stag
a
burlesque
show
at
a
sale
conference
in
the
midwest
the
skit
be
too
vulgar
to
believe
about
an
indian
village
star
the
manager
himself
as
the
chief
and
some
scantily
clad
model
as
squaw
they
even
have
live
chicken
run
around
on
the
stage
at
the
end
of
the
skit
the
manager
disappear
with
one
of
these
model
into
a
tepee
and
as
he
turn
to
go
into
the
tent
the
audience
saw
a
sign
on
his
back
that
say
something
like
branch
manager
i
do
all
thing
for
all
people
then
he
and
the
girl
pull
the
tepee
flap
close
behind
them
there
be
family
present
and
somebody
who
witness
the
show
write
me
a
letter
say
be
this
what
you
call
ibm
dignity
so
i
start
a
big
inquiry
the
manager
in
question
be
a
top
performer
one
of
ibm
s
best
men
but
it
be
our
policy
to
run
a
clean
show
and
i
say
he
should
be
fire
his
boss
try
everything
to
keep
him
and
even
try
hiding
him
from
me
by
transfer
him
to
the
west
coast
but
finally
he
left
the
company
because
everybody
knew
that
whenever
his
name
come
up
i
be
go
to
raise
hell
any
time
i
intervene
in
a
matter
of
personnel
policy
or
spot
something
i
didn
t
like
at
a
branch
office
or
plant
i
d
write
it
down
in
the
think
notebook
i
carry
in
my
pocket
often
i
d
use
it
as
raw
material
for
a
type
of
memorandum
call
a
management
briefing
that
be
sent
to
every
manager
right
down
to
the
foreman
on
the
factory
floor
i
put
as
much
energy
into
write
those
memo
as
dad
put
into
his
editorial
in
think
magazine
when
you
be
cop
with
a
business
full
of
new
manager
you
learn
to
take
nothing
for
grant
for
example
one
of
my
memo
be
a
primer
on
how
to
hold
a
meeting
without
waste
time
my
advice
be
to
keep
it
as
small
as
possible
short
and
to
the
point
i
write
nearly
a
hundred
of
those
memo
try
to
teach
how
to
handle
everyday
problem
in
an
ibm
way
for
example
there
be
the
issue
of
employee
transfer
be
transfer
be
a
standard
part
of
white
collar
life
in
the
s
but
when
people
start
joking
that
ibm
stood
for
i
ve
be
move
i
realize
our
transfer
must
be
get
out
of
hand
we
look
into
how
we
move
people
around
and
found
that
many
transfer
be
be
make
solely
for
the
convenience
of
ibm
without
regard
for
the
employee
whose
family
be
be
uprooted
that
violate
one
of
the
basic
tenet
of
ibm
philosophy
consideration
for
the
individual
so
i
write
to
our
manager
that
no
one
should
be
offer
a
transfer
without
a
substantial
increase
in
pay
and
responsibility
and
the
number
of
transfer
drop
right
away
another
case
typical
of
the
time
be
the
employee
who
get
fire
for
refuse
to
shave
off
his
beard
his
manager
told
him
his
appearance
do
not
fit
in
with
the
decor
or
with
ibm
s
corporate
image
many
of
the
scientist
and
mathematician
we
be
hire
off
the
campus
be
bring
their
beard
and
informal
wardrobe
with
them
i
want
ibm
people
to
be
well
groom
but
i
thought
informality
be
fine
in
the
research
lab
so
i
insist
that
we
offer
the
man
his
job
back
and
sent
out
a
briefing
explain
that
ibm
s
corporate
design
program
apply
to
product
building
and
decor
but
not
people
of
course
it
s
true
a
conservative
appearance
have
always
be
the
custom
at
ibm
a
whole
folklore
grow
up
about
ibm
conformity
the
white
shirt
and
dark
suit
but
there
be
a
reason
for
it
in
one
way
or
another
we
be
all
salesman
in
ibm
individually
and
collectively
and
nothing
distracts
from
a
sale
like
an
outlandish
appearance
conservative
dress
make
sense
as
a
marketing
tool
just
like
a
plant
tour
an
education
program
for
customer
or
a
reputation
for
excellence
it
show
we
take
our
work
seriously
the
quality
i
look
for
in
a
manager
and
value
above
practically
everything
else
be
common
sense
dad
put
less
emphasis
on
it
maybe
because
he
have
so
much
of
it
himself
and
what
he
mainly
need
from
employee
be
enthusiasm
but
now
that
we
be
a
huge
corporation
do
business
with
thousand
of
small
company
too
much
zeal
could
cause
harm
for
instance
we
have
a
contractor
who
sell
us
milk
for
the
company
cafeteria
in
poughkeepsie
the
local
ibm
controller
be
try
to
save
some
money
and
he
threaten
to
take
this
guy
s
contract
away
unless
he
drop
his
price
there
s
a
level
below
which
you
can
t
sell
milk
without
go
broke
and
we
have
that
guy
almost
at
that
level
he
finally
write
to
me
and
say
you
be
use
your
economic
power
here
to
kill
me
i
go
to
poughkeepsie
and
talk
to
the
controller
and
found
out
it
be
true
and
i
get
terribly
mad
that
any
ibm
employee
could
be
that
dumb
we
have
a
similar
problem
with
a
customer
in
providence
a
small
businessman
who
be
use
ibm
equipment
to
send
out
his
bill
his
business
be
struggle
and
he
refuse
to
pay
for
the
installation
say
he
wasn
t
happy
with
the
way
it
work
the
way
our
local
office
handle
this
defy
all
logic
they
should
have
either
satisfied
the
man
or
take
the
machine
out
but
instead
they
begin
billing
him
in
arrears
and
finally
take
him
to
court
i
didn
t
hear
about
this
until
the
trial
be
ready
to
start
and
the
stupidity
of
what
we
d
do
drove
me
wild
if
anybody
have
use
his
head
he
d
have
foreseen
what
the
customer
s
lawyer
would
say
to
the
jury
here
be
this
colossus
make
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
a
year
bullying
this
little
guy
who
hasn
t
paid
because
their
machine
won
t
work
that
be
not
how
i
want
ibm
to
look
i
say
settle
and
we
end
up
have
to
give
him
a
couple
of
million
dollar
i
could
set
up
all
the
guideline
in
the
world
to
try
to
avoid
such
situation
but
i
sometimes
found
that
temper
be
the
best
way
to
get
a
management
lesson
across
in
the
fall
of
i
learn
of
two
young
men
who
come
to
ibm
headquarters
to
apply
for
job
get
snubbed
and
left
with
the
impression
it
be
because
they
be
jewish
one
of
them
sent
me
a
complaint
and
after
check
i
found
out
that
they
hadn
t
even
be
grant
an
interview
instead
somebody
have
label
them
obviously
not
the
ibm
type
the
more
i
thought
about
this
the
angrier
i
felt
because
ibm
have
a
clear
rule
against
discrimination
in
hire
i
d
write
that
rule
myself
in
during
the
early
stage
of
the
civil
right
movement
i
brought
the
job
applicant
s
letter
with
me
to
the
williamsburg
conference
and
interrupt
the
proceeding
to
read
it
out
loud
how
do
you
expect
me
to
represent
ibm
to
the
world
outside
when
this
sort
of
thing
go
on
inside
i
holler
to
the
executive
gather
there
then
i
m
told
i
point
at
jack
bricker
our
brand
new
personnel
chief
who
be
sit
in
one
of
the
front
row
and
order
him
to
clean
up
the
matter
and
discipline
whoever
have
mishandle
it
it
be
theatrical
but
i
make
a
crucial
point
i
didn
t
want
there
to
be
any
difference
between
what
ibm
say
and
what
ibm
do
as
time
pass
i
become
increasingly
intolerant
of
executive
or
manager
who
broke
rule
of
integrity
a
business
be
a
sort
of
dictatorship
the
antitrust
law
tell
you
what
you
can
do
and
you
don
t
need
anyone
to
tell
you
that
you
shouldn
t
be
a
thief
but
within
those
boundary
the
top
man
have
wide
discretion
he
can
give
unfair
bonus
he
can
suggest
policy
that
be
not
right
he
can
run
airplane
to
golf
resort
i
never
criticize
my
contemporary
publicly
but
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
that
ibm
do
differently
from
other
business
during
my
watch
i
thought
that
the
head
of
a
business
have
responsibility
almost
like
the
head
of
a
government
without
a
supreme
court
and
without
check
and
balance
except
those
that
the
marketplace
and
the
annual
report
impose
on
his
operation
one
of
the
bad
mistake
he
can
make
be
to
apply
a
double
standard
to
manager
and
employee
if
a
manager
do
something
unethical
he
should
be
fire
just
as
surely
as
a
factory
worker
this
be
the
wholesome
use
of
the
bos
s
power
when
we
first
decentralize
ibm
i
simply
assume
that
all
of
our
executive
would
apply
the
same
high
standard
of
conduct
automatically
it
take
me
a
number
of
year
to
realize
that
a
chief
executive
have
to
spot
check
decision
make
by
his
subordinate
on
one
occasion
some
manager
in
one
of
our
plant
start
a
chain
letter
involve
u
s
saving
bond
the
idea
be
that
one
manager
would
write
to
five
other
manager
and
each
of
those
would
write
to
five
more
who
would
each
send
some
bond
back
to
the
first
guy
and
write
to
five
more
and
so
on
pretty
soon
they
ran
out
of
manager
and
get
down
to
employee
it
end
up
that
the
employee
felt
pressure
to
join
the
chain
letter
and
pay
off
the
manager
i
get
a
complaint
about
this
and
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
head
of
the
division
i
expect
him
to
say
at
a
minimum
we
ve
get
to
fire
a
couple
of
guy
i
ll
handle
it
instead
he
simply
say
well
it
be
a
mistake
i
couldn
t
convince
him
to
fire
anybody
now
you
could
admire
him
for
defend
his
team
but
i
think
there
be
a
time
when
integrity
should
take
the
rudder
from
team
loyalty
all
the
same
i
didn
t
pursue
the
matter
any
far
and
my
failure
to
act
come
back
to
haunt
me
a
couple
of
year
later
in
that
same
division
a
manager
fire
a
low
level
employee
who
have
be
steal
engineering
diagram
and
sell
them
to
a
competitor
fire
him
would
have
be
fine
except
that
the
manager
handle
it
in
a
brutal
way
the
employee
in
question
have
one
thing
in
his
life
that
he
be
proud
of
his
commission
in
the
u
s
army
reserve
where
he
held
the
rank
of
major
instead
of
simply
go
to
the
man
s
house
and
tell
him
you
swipe
the
drawing
and
we
re
go
to
fire
you
the
manager
picked
a
week
when
the
fellow
be
in
military
camp
to
low
the
boom
somehow
the
military
authority
get
involve
as
well
and
the
man
be
strip
of
his
commission
the
humiliation
cause
him
to
become
insanely
angry
and
for
the
next
few
year
he
devote
himself
to
make
me
uncomfortable
he
sent
picture
of
tom
watson
jr
behind
bar
to
his
senator
and
his
congressman
and
to
every
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
he
kept
hark
back
to
that
chain
letter
because
he
knew
we
have
tolerate
the
men
responsible
for
it
eventually
he
simmer
down
but
the
incident
really
taught
me
a
lesson
after
that
i
simply
fire
manager
when
they
broke
rule
of
integrity
i
do
it
in
perhaps
a
dozen
case
include
a
couple
involve
senior
executive
i
have
to
overrule
a
lot
of
people
each
time
who
would
argue
that
we
should
merely
demote
the
man
or
transfer
him
or
that
the
business
would
fall
apart
without
him
but
the
company
be
invariably
well
off
for
the
decision
and
the
example
i
knew
exactly
the
attitude
i
want
to
cultivate
in
ordinary
ibm
employee
i
want
them
to
feel
a
proprietary
interest
and
to
have
some
knowledge
of
each
other
s
problem
and
goal
i
also
want
them
to
feel
that
they
have
access
to
top
management
and
that
no
one
be
so
far
down
the
chain
of
command
that
he
couldn
t
be
kept
aware
of
where
the
business
be
head
as
the
hierarchy
grow
to
include
five
six
and
seven
layer
of
command
this
become
a
huge
challenge
i
be
constantly
look
for
way
to
maintain
what
i
call
a
small
company
attitude
one
of
the
surprising
thing
we
learn
be
that
to
overcome
the
problem
of
change
we
have
to
increase
communication
within
ibm
far
out
of
proportion
to
our
growth
rate
we
use
a
variety
of
channel
for
listen
to
our
employee
include
survey
suggestion
program
and
even
a
question
and
answer
program
call
speak
up
that
incorporate
bureaucratic
procedure
to
shield
the
identity
of
the
questioner
from
top
management
our
most
unusual
method
for
shorten
the
distance
between
the
salesman
or
factory
man
and
top
management
be
the
open
door
a
practice
of
dad
s
that
trace
back
to
the
early
s
this
be
primarily
a
system
of
justice
but
it
also
give
me
a
measure
of
ibm
s
health
that
i
could
not
have
gotten
any
other
way
disgruntle
employee
at
ibm
be
first
expect
to
take
up
their
gripe
with
their
manager
but
if
they
get
no
satisfaction
they
have
the
right
to
come
directly
to
me
nine
out
of
ten
such
case
involve
matter
that
should
have
be
resolve
far
down
or
where
low
management
have
already
make
the
right
decision
but
i
listen
anyway
i
learn
an
awful
lot
about
the
problem
of
the
work
man
and
i
gain
a
visceral
sense
about
ibm
that
enable
me
to
hear
a
complaint
and
say
something
s
wrong
here
on
at
least
one
occasion
a
single
protest
lead
to
a
substantial
change
in
the
way
we
do
business
a
machinist
who
be
about
to
be
fire
from
the
poughkeepsie
plant
come
to
see
me
he
say
they
re
not
treat
people
fairly
i
m
make
more
piece
than
anyone
in
that
shop
and
i
get
the
low
pay
i
don
t
see
how
that
can
be
true
i
told
him
but
i
call
the
plant
manager
and
told
him
what
the
man
have
say
well
you
know
he
be
a
very
uncooperative
employee
he
doesn
t
belong
to
the
ibm
club
he
doesn
t
participate
in
outside
activity
and
sometimes
he
doesn
t
even
dress
neatly
when
he
come
to
work
that
wasn
t
the
question
i
be
ask
i
call
the
man
s
foreman
and
say
do
he
make
more
piece
and
get
less
pay
he
doesn
t
reflect
well
on
the
company
he
have
a
couple
of
wreck
car
in
the
yard
in
front
of
his
house
and
he
doesn
t
take
care
of
his
child
the
machinist
be
up
against
what
i
call
the
ibm
protective
association
where
local
manager
close
rank
to
cover
up
rough
treatment
of
employee
who
may
be
totally
blameless
finally
the
manager
admit
that
the
man
be
tell
the
truth
we
give
him
a
raise
discipline
the
manager
involve
and
then
we
go
through
every
one
of
our
u
s
plant
and
tie
pay
to
productivity
this
cause
quite
a
commotion
because
put
in
a
system
that
reward
the
best
producer
meant
partly
undo
my
father
s
decision
twenty
year
earlier
to
abolish
piecework
many
employee
do
not
want
to
take
a
complaint
all
the
way
to
me
but
the
very
existence
of
the
open
door
be
a
morale
builder
it
make
them
feel
free
to
approach
a
personnel
manager
or
the
man
run
the
plant
when
they
have
a
problem
as
ibm
grow
we
try
to
take
care
of
more
and
more
open
door
case
at
the
division
chief
level
with
only
charge
of
serious
mismanagement
that
might
reflect
unfavorably
on
ibm
come
to
my
office
but
even
so
my
office
handle
two
or
three
hundred
case
each
year
with
each
case
typically
take
several
day
to
resolve
the
bulk
of
this
work
fell
to
my
administrative
assistant
who
be
chosen
from
among
our
most
promising
young
manager
this
be
the
best
apprenticeship
an
ibm
executive
could
have
because
it
test
his
or
her
ability
to
handle
highly
sensitive
matter
and
require
full
comprehension
of
the
company
philosophy
periodically
i
d
see
complainant
myself
so
that
word
would
get
around
that
the
head
man
be
indeed
available
my
father
have
always
felt
a
direct
connection
with
the
work
man
because
with
his
humble
root
he
have
know
hard
time
hard
work
and
unemployment
as
a
result
he
try
to
blur
the
distinction
between
white
collar
and
blue
collar
worker
not
only
do
he
provide
secure
job
and
good
pay
for
the
people
in
our
plant
but
the
fact
that
for
many
year
ibm
s
pension
be
base
solely
on
length
of
service
not
salary
or
position
stood
my
father
in
good
stead
during
the
period
in
the
s
and
s
when
there
be
a
lot
of
labor
unrest
in
america
organizer
be
hit
pretty
hard
at
the
lush
retirement
plan
some
company
offer
their
executive
i
don
t
think
his
primary
motive
be
to
keep
the
union
out
but
that
be
one
effect
while
the
factory
have
always
be
more
closely
associate
with
dad
than
with
me
i
look
for
a
way
to
extend
dad
s
philosophy
even
far
in
jack
bricker
the
personnel
director
come
back
to
me
with
a
radical
proposal
that
we
abolish
the
hourly
wage
and
shift
all
of
our
employee
onto
salary
this
would
eliminate
the
last
difference
between
factory
and
office
work
and
put
all
of
our
people
on
an
equal
status
it
be
a
dare
plan
affect
about
twenty
thousand
of
our
sixty
thousand
u
s
employee
and
bricker
have
the
detail
so
well
work
out
that
all
i
have
to
do
be
approve
it
in
january
i
announce
this
change
in
a
nationwide
telephone
broadcast
to
the
factory
although
the
shift
to
salary
come
off
well
a
number
of
our
manager
predict
that
many
worker
would
take
advantage
of
the
policy
and
skip
work
whenever
they
felt
like
it
the
joke
go
around
that
on
the
first
day
of
hunt
season
no
one
would
show
up
for
work
at
our
rochester
minnesota
plant
as
far
as
i
know
we
be
the
first
major
industrial
company
to
put
its
whole
population
on
salary
it
be
a
small
contribution
to
u
s
labor
history
due
solely
to
jack
bricker
and
i
be
very
proud
of
it
a
few
month
later
at
a
meeting
in
washington
walter
reuther
the
great
united
auto
worker
leader
couldn
t
resist
needle
me
what
be
you
try
to
do
he
say
make
us
look
bad
i
consider
take
even
more
radical
step
to
increase
ibm
s
commitment
to
its
employee
when
i
talk
to
my
wife
at
night
i
would
speak
of
various
way
of
share
our
success
more
broadly
those
at
the
top
be
do
fantastically
well
on
stock
option
despite
the
fact
that
williams
and
i
stop
take
option
in
after
williams
say
we
don
t
want
to
look
like
pig
while
ibm
s
worker
be
make
good
money
they
couldn
t
look
forward
to
the
rich
capital
gain
that
executive
with
option
have
in
my
own
case
for
example
i
have
stock
option
worth
about
five
time
my
salary
or
close
to
million
from
that
investment
i
knew
that
i
be
go
to
make
ten
of
million
of
dollar
if
ibm
kept
do
as
well
as
it
always
have
i
ask
myself
how
much
more
be
i
worth
to
ibm
than
that
guy
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
pay
scale
twice
as
much
sure
ten
time
as
much
maybe
twenty
time
as
much
probably
not
i
become
more
and
more
puzzle
at
the
idea
of
reward
executive
at
a
rate
wholly
different
from
the
people
down
the
line
so
i
begin
to
think
about
way
of
share
the
fruit
of
ibm
s
success
my
first
idea
be
to
distribute
the
company
profit
right
down
to
the
office
boy
when
i
mention
this
to
williams
he
be
horrify
that
would
put
us
out
of
business
he
say
he
show
how
if
we
reckon
what
our
stock
option
would
likely
be
worth
and
average
them
out
over
our
career
they
probably
triple
our
annual
pay
if
we
turn
around
and
triple
the
whole
payroll
he
say
we
d
be
give
away
the
entire
profit
nothing
would
be
left
for
the
shareholder
that
make
me
think
even
harder
i
begin
ask
myself
whether
our
present
form
of
capitalism
be
the
best
way
to
support
american
democracy
in
the
long
term
it
didn
t
seem
that
way
to
me
i
thought
that
the
model
corporation
of
the
future
should
be
largely
own
by
the
people
who
work
for
it
not
by
bank
or
mutual
fund
or
shareholder
who
might
have
inherit
the
stock
from
their
parent
and
do
nothing
to
earn
it
entrepreneur
and
capitalist
would
always
have
a
key
place
if
you
risk
your
money
by
put
it
behind
henry
ford
you
certainly
ought
to
be
able
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
your
investment
but
there
be
enormous
strength
in
proprietorship
people
develop
strong
attachment
to
the
thing
they
own
especially
if
they
can
influence
whether
those
thing
succeed
or
fail
and
it
seem
imprudent
to
let
the
ownership
of
a
business
rest
with
people
and
institution
that
be
not
directly
involve
remedy
this
situation
would
have
to
be
an
evolutionary
process
but
as
i
imagine
it
gradually
over
two
or
three
generation
a
business
would
by
law
shift
into
the
hand
of
employee
though
i
never
found
a
practical
way
to
achieve
it
on
a
meaningful
scale
i
begin
look
for
way
to
increase
employee
ownership
of
ibm
in
we
establish
a
stock
purchase
plan
whereby
any
employee
could
allot
up
to
ten
percent
of
his
salary
and
acquire
ibm
share
at
percent
of
their
market
value
this
be
a
step
beyond
what
my
father
have
be
willing
to
do
even
though
he
encourage
employee
to
buy
the
stock
he
stop
short
of
set
up
a
formal
program
because
he
didn
t
want
those
who
couldn
t
afford
loss
to
take
undue
risk
he
never
forgot
his
own
close
scrape
with
creditor
when
the
bottom
drop
out
of
the
stock
in
the
s
if
everybody
in
ibm
have
start
buying
stock
when
the
purchase
plan
start
and
held
onto
it
the
company
would
belong
to
the
employee
by
now
and
there
would
be
ibm
millionaire
by
the
thousand
but
that
be
not
how
it
work
out
instead
many
people
bought
the
stock
but
very
few
stayed
with
it
most
people
would
get
a
percent
increase
in
their
investment
and
sell
out
we
also
found
that
the
plan
hurt
morale
whenever
the
stock
value
decline
i
do
everything
i
could
to
encourage
them
to
hold
on
short
of
personally
tout
the
stock
every
year
for
example
we
publish
figure
show
how
wealthy
people
become
by
own
ibm
over
a
long
period
but
people
never
use
the
plan
to
the
extent
i
envision
do
this
mean
the
average
guy
on
the
factory
line
be
stupid
i
don
t
think
so
i
figure
their
reluctance
to
stay
with
the
stock
be
mainly
due
to
economic
circumstance
most
likely
a
man
be
sell
out
because
he
d
rather
have
the
mortgage
on
his
house
reduce
than
keep
his
money
at
risk
in
the
stock
if
you
look
at
the
median
ibm
salary
although
it
be
above
the
national
average
it
didn
t
leave
much
latitude
for
fiddle
around
with
investment
risk
we
decide
we
could
do
the
best
for
our
employee
by
develop
benefit
such
as
major
medical
coverage
scholarship
and
college
tuition
loan
and
match
grant
for
charity
and
school
i
want
ibm
to
be
recognize
as
one
of
the
most
generous
employer
in
america
during
the
late
s
i
have
a
very
popular
family
life
come
to
greenwich
and
do
a
photo
essay
about
us
a
little
while
later
sport
illustrate
put
us
on
the
cover
skiing
family
the
tom
watson
it
say
and
the
picture
show
olive
and
me
and
four
of
our
kid
fooling
around
in
a
snowy
vermont
scene
if
people
magazine
have
exist
i
suppose
we
might
have
be
in
that
as
well
we
seem
to
have
everything
my
success
olive
s
beauty
and
by
this
time
six
bright
energetic
kid
however
life
behind
the
scene
wasn
t
always
so
ideal
we
have
the
usual
stress
and
strain
that
anyone
in
a
large
family
could
understand
but
the
main
problem
be
my
temper
if
my
disposition
have
be
easy
i
might
have
have
a
brilliant
career
as
a
father
because
i
do
a
lot
of
imaginative
thing
for
my
child
my
great
shortcoming
unfortunately
be
that
i
do
not
understand
how
to
change
pace
when
i
left
the
office
that
be
the
toughest
thing
for
any
manager
to
learn
all
day
long
i
face
a
parade
of
people
ask
for
decision
whether
to
worry
about
a
competitor
s
new
product
how
to
resolve
an
ambiguity
in
ibm
s
personnel
policy
what
to
do
about
a
manager
paralyze
with
grief
over
the
loss
of
a
spouse
through
all
of
it
would
be
the
telephone
ring
more
people
with
more
problem
the
decision
themselves
be
never
that
hard
to
make
what
be
hard
be
the
cumulative
effect
of
be
the
man
on
the
spot
day
after
day
after
day
try
as
i
might
it
be
never
possible
to
delegate
enough
by
the
time
i
get
home
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
me
i
d
walk
in
and
find
the
usual
disorder
of
a
large
household
one
of
the
kid
have
shot
a
bb
gun
at
a
passing
car
or
two
of
them
be
fight
or
somebody
have
bad
grade
these
thing
would
strike
me
as
crisis
that
need
to
be
resolve
right
away
and
yet
i
have
no
energy
to
bring
to
bear
i
d
feel
a
desperate
wish
for
somebody
else
to
step
in
and
make
the
decision
so
i
didn
t
have
to
that
s
when
i
d
blow
up
the
kid
would
scatter
like
quail
and
olive
would
catch
the
brunt
of
my
frustration
in
fact
she
be
a
wonderful
mother
patient
and
sympathetic
i
suppose
i
want
her
to
be
as
strict
a
disciplinarian
as
my
own
mother
have
be
with
me
even
though
this
be
foreign
to
olive
s
nature
it
take
me
year
to
grasp
the
fundamental
difference
between
run
a
company
and
head
a
family
ibm
be
like
drive
a
car
when
i
come
to
a
corner
i
could
steer
around
it
very
nicely
and
off
the
car
would
go
down
a
new
road
i
hit
bump
here
and
there
but
generally
the
car
go
where
i
want
with
my
family
this
wasn
t
the
case
the
family
be
more
like
a
car
with
two
steer
wheel
or
multiple
steer
wheel
and
only
one
of
them
belong
to
me
i
kept
try
to
exercise
more
control
than
i
have
when
i
saw
i
could
not
bend
my
wife
and
child
to
my
will
i
d
feel
totally
thwart
and
boxed
in
those
be
the
blackest
moment
of
my
adult
life
an
argument
with
olive
and
the
kid
would
sometimes
make
me
so
morose
that
the
only
thing
i
could
do
be
hole
up
i
d
lock
myself
in
my
dress
room
and
olive
would
stand
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
try
to
get
me
to
come
out
finally
she
d
reach
the
end
of
her
rope
she
d
call
my
brother
and
say
can
t
you
come
cheer
tom
up
dick
would
come
down
from
new
canaan
he
always
knew
how
to
make
my
responsibility
seem
lighter
and
draw
me
back
into
the
world
my
hot
temper
also
backfire
when
i
do
community
work
for
several
year
i
be
president
of
the
board
of
trustee
at
the
greenwich
country
day
school
where
we
sent
our
child
i
work
hard
at
this
job
and
i
think
that
the
people
who
serve
with
me
would
have
say
watson
be
a
man
under
enormous
pressure
but
he
be
creative
and
never
miss
a
meeting
my
downfall
come
one
summer
when
the
local
newspaper
carry
a
police
report
that
one
of
our
teacher
have
solicit
a
vagrant
for
a
homosexual
encounter
the
community
be
in
an
uproar
and
the
headmaster
who
should
have
handle
the
matter
have
just
left
for
vacation
with
his
wife
when
someone
tracked
him
down
by
phone
he
suggest
that
the
matter
be
turn
over
to
the
assistant
headmaster
instead
i
do
what
i
would
have
do
at
ibm
i
organize
a
task
force
of
influential
board
member
investigate
the
incident
and
discharge
the
teacher
with
a
sum
of
money
from
the
board
to
help
pay
for
psychiatric
treatment
that
should
have
be
the
end
of
it
but
i
be
so
angry
with
the
headmaster
for
not
have
dealt
with
the
problem
himself
that
when
he
get
back
i
bawl
him
out
he
really
blew
his
top
it
dawn
on
me
too
late
that
i
shouldn
t
alienate
the
man
he
be
a
capable
administrator
and
more
essential
than
i
to
the
run
of
the
school
our
dispute
spill
over
to
the
board
which
reject
my
effort
to
make
amends
by
donate
money
for
one
of
the
headmaster
s
pet
project
finally
i
resign
as
president
but
not
before
almost
come
to
blow
in
the
middle
of
a
meeting
with
a
fellow
board
member
a
prominent
banker
he
accuse
me
of
be
self
serve
and
i
grabbed
his
arm
whirl
him
around
to
face
me
and
be
ready
to
hit
him
when
i
heard
somebody
in
the
background
say
don
t
be
a
damn
fool
that
outburst
damage
my
reputation
to
such
a
degree
that
i
be
never
invite
to
join
another
greenwich
board
my
temper
tantrum
at
home
usually
didn
t
last
very
long
and
my
father
have
taught
me
never
to
let
the
sun
set
on
a
family
argument
as
i
cool
off
i
d
see
the
error
of
my
way
and
come
back
to
put
my
arm
around
olive
and
apologize
for
my
inexcusable
behavior
when
my
highhandedness
and
volatile
temper
cause
hard
feeling
in
our
house
it
be
her
patience
and
understand
that
actually
kept
the
family
together
she
have
an
ability
to
love
in
a
perfectly
natural
and
deep
way
and
she
often
show
me
more
kindness
than
i
deserve
like
all
parent
olive
and
i
be
try
to
improve
on
the
way
in
which
we
d
be
raise
i
thought
my
father
have
never
take
enough
time
for
his
private
life
he
be
always
mr
ibm
and
when
he
wasn
t
work
he
be
somewhere
else
in
the
public
arena
advance
his
own
reputation
and
the
company
s
i
never
want
ibm
to
monopolize
my
time
the
way
it
monopolize
his
and
i
be
young
and
vigorous
enough
to
do
the
sort
of
active
thing
with
my
kid
that
dad
never
do
with
me
i
save
almost
all
my
weekend
to
take
them
skiing
or
camp
or
sail
and
i
do
everything
i
could
to
give
them
a
sense
of
fun
and
adventure
olive
have
only
one
brother
grow
up
and
always
imagine
how
nice
have
a
large
family
must
be
in
the
late
s
she
d
be
able
to
observe
one
big
clan
closely
the
kennedy
although
joseph
kennedy
be
ambassador
to
england
then
the
family
be
still
not
widely
know
just
by
chance
olive
become
friend
with
jack
and
two
of
his
sister
in
school
and
she
begin
spending
time
during
the
summer
at
their
hyannis
port
house
sunday
dinner
in
our
own
house
be
model
to
an
extent
after
theirs
olive
would
organize
the
meal
by
name
a
subject
for
discussion
it
could
be
anything
from
horse
to
the
country
of
japan
but
there
be
one
subject
and
you
have
to
do
research

be
never
any
good
at
play
with
baby
we
concentrate
on
sport
the
whole
family
could
do
we
built
a
tennis
court
with
the
idea
that
everybody
could
learn
together
we
all
have
bike
and
on
weekend
we
d
go
on
family
ride
sometimes
to
the
embarrassment
of
our
teenager
the
center
of
our
winter
activity
be
our
ski
lodge
in
vermont
olive
and
i
have
be
go
to
vermont
to
ski
ever
since
the
blind
date
on
which
we
met
and
when
ibm
hit
the
billion
dollar
mark
we
built
a
house
there
from
the
standpoint
of
family
finance
this
decision
seem
as
momentous
and
risky
as
any
i
make
at
work
skiing
be
still
fairly
uncommon
then
there
be
only
one
other
ski
house
near
where
we
built
our
lodge
about
six
mile
outside
stowe
at
the
foot
of
mount
mansfield
the
chair
lift
on
that
mountain
be
the
first
in
new
england
it
ran
the
chair
up
single
file
and
on
busy
weekend
you
be
lucky
if
you
wait
only
forty
five
minute
to
take
your
turn
the
house
itself
have
great
vault
ceiling
and
a
wall
of
glass
look
out
on
the
snowy
wood
it
slept
twenty
people
with
two
bedroom
for
couple
and
dormitory
for
boy
and
girl
we
fill
the
place
with
souvenir
from
our
alpine
and
scandinavian
trip
and
on
the
floor
we
have
carpeting
that
could
be
roll
back
to
bare
linoleum
for
dance
near
the
fireplace
hung
an
ordinary
look
painting
of
a
snowy
mountainside
that
symbolize
what
vermont
meant
to
me
the
painting
have
hung
originally
in
the
banquet
hall
of
the
ibm
country
club
at
endicott
where
dad
held
endless
testimonial
dinner
it
always
remind
me
of
a
particular
bend
in
one
of
the
ski
trail
at
stowe
i
d
get
through
those
endicott
dinner
by
fix
my
eye
on
it
and
think
in
two
more
day
i
ll
be
there
we
d
make
the
seven
hour
drive
to
stowe
almost
every
weekend
some
of
our
family
s
happiest
time
be
in
that
house
i
still
recall
pull
into
the
driveway
with
a
station
wagon
full
of
lovely
little
kid
clamor
to
get
out
and
show
their
friend
where
to
sleep
the
lodge
be
an
excite
place
for
unsuspecting
guest
because
we
be
constantly
play
joke
on
each
other
rubber
snake
hidden
in
the
bedclothes
cup
of
water
balance
on
top
of
door
olive
and
i
make
the
kid
bring
their
homework
but
most
often
they
d
drop
their
book
bag
near
the
front
door
on
the
way
in
and
not
touch
them
again
until
the
weekend
be
over
that
be
partly
my
fault
i
kept
them
so
active
that
they
didn
t
have
time
to
read
i
d
roust
the
kid
out
each
morning
at
seven
o
clock
by
turn
on
the
dormitory
light
and
play
yodel
music
full
blast
we
d
feed
them
then
turn
them
loose
on
the
slope
and
no
one
be
allow
back
into
the
house
until
the
lift
close
around
four
we
intentionally
kept
thing
spartan
on
those
ski
trip
there
be
no
way
for
our
kid
not
to
know
they
be
surround
by
increase
wealth
but
we
didn
t
want
them
grow
up
coddle
and
spoil
the
cleaning
and
cooking
be
all
do
by
olive
and
me
fix
food
be
something
i
love
go
back
to
the
day
when
i
earn
a
cooking
merit
badge
in
the
boy
scout
under
my
mother
s
appreciative
eye
i
have
the
whole
kitchen
organize
with
label
on
all
the
drawer
and
cabinet
so
that
whoever
be
help
me
could
put
the
stuff
away
correctly
olive
invent
a
clever
way
to
organize
the
dormitory
she
found
out
that
there
be
six
standard
color
of
towel
available
so
she
have
the
six
bed
in
each
dormitory
paint
those
same
color
each
bed
have
its
own
match
towel
hang
at
the
end
and
in
the
bathroom
there
be
cabinet
color
cod
the
same
way
so
there
be
no
argument
about
keep
the
dormitory
neat
meanwhile
i
try
to
pas
along
my
mother
s
sense
of
thrift
my
daughter
jeannette
tell
the
story
of
how
i
be
constantly
badgering
people
to
turn
out
light
when
leave
a
room
this
campaign
fail
and
finally
one
morning
i
wait
until
they
d
all
go
out
unscrewed
the
light
bulb
that
they
d
left
burning
and
hid
them
when
the
kid
come
back
at
sunset
none
of
them
could
turn
on
their
light
building
a
ski
lodge
be
a
pretty
ambitious
undertaking
but
i
have
even
grander
idea
when
we
look
for
a
summer
house
i
want
a
place
where
we
could
land
an
airplane
and
anchor
the
sailboat
i
have
for
ocean
race
and
that
we
could
afford
while
the
kid
be
still
young
without
wait
for
ibm
to
grow
even
large
olive
and
i
do
our
prospect
from
a
small
rent
airplane
we
flew
both
coast
of
long
island
then
block
island
martha
s
vineyard
nantucket
and
cape
cod
pretty
soon
we
be
halfway
up
the
coast
of
maine
near
camden
where
dad
have
a
summer
house
when
i
be
a
boy
finally
we
found
an
interest
place
on
north
haven
island
several
mile
out
from
camden
in
penobscot
bay
the
land
for
sale
be
call
oak
hill
farm
a
beautiful
and
rugged
half
mile
long
peninsula
with
rocky
beach
grove
of
spruce
bare
field
cropped
short
by
generation
of
sheep
and
at
the
high
point
a
few
lonely
oak
that
give
the
place
its
name
the
only
building
be
a
ramble
old
farmhouse
with
fall
down
chimney
but
there
be
a
good
cove
and
sufficient
level
ground
for
an
airstrip
there
be
nothing
more
beautiful
than
summer
on
the
coast
of
maine
when
everything
bloom
during
the
short
intermission
from
nine
month
of
cold
and
fog
that
magical
place
become
the
center
of
our
summer
and
visitor
come
in
a
constant
stream
aviator
yachtsman
kid
friend
from
school
the
house
have
be
vacant
for
twenty
year
when
we
bought
it
the
previous
owner
have
be
planning
to
bulldoze
it
and
build
a
proper
mansion
on
the
high
hilltop
of
the
farm
but
olive
and
i
decide
the
exist
building
would
suit
us
fine
once
the
chimney
and
roof
be
fix
it
actually
consist
of
a
barn
and
two
farmhouse
that
have
be
put
together
fifty
year
before
the
house
have
plenty
of
small
snug
room
and
the
barn
be
a
large
recreation
space
one
year
we
invite
the
entire
island
for
a
square
dance
there
and
the
dance
become
a
summer
tradition
we
cut
road
and
vista
through
the
spruce
grove
we
brought
horse
and
pony
and
donkey
to
ride
i
get
the
idea
that
we
should
turn
loose
a
lot
of
animal
on
the
land
safe
animal
that
would
be
fun
to
have
around
so
i
talk
to
dillon
ripley
the
head
of
the
smithsonian
to
get
the
name
of
harmless
specie
llama
be
right
at
the
head
of
the
list
so
we
get
a
pair
of
llama
then
some
fallow
deer
which
be
yellowish
brown
and
extremely
skittish
and
pheasant
and
woodcock
and
wild
turkey
i
almost
get
some
buffalo
after
learn
that
there
be
two
buffalo
farm
in
maine
i
call
the
first
guy
and
told
him
i
be
interested
in
get
some
as
pet
and
he
say
pet
these
be
vicious
animal
if
you
catch
them
in
the
wrong
mood
they
ll
attack
you
i
thanked
him
and
call
the
second
buffalo
farmer
who
be
more
of
a
salesman
he
say
they
be
as
gentle
as
bunny
we
feed
them
right
out
of
our
kitchen
door
he
told
me
both
be
willing
to
sell
me
buffalo
but
i
decide
to
take
the
first
guy
s
advice
instead
i
bought
a
pair
of
reindeer
and
some
mouflon
sheep
which
be
domesticate
but
look
like
rocky
mountain
sheep
with
long
curve
horn
i
saw
oak
hill
as
the
place
where
no
project
be
too
whimsical
to
pursue
i
love
to
drive
the
kid
up
and
down
the
hill
in
an
old
model
t
like
the
one
i
bought
on
the
sly
when
i
be
only
twelve
the
kid
name
the
road
with
family
phrase
such
as
it
s
hard
but
it
s
fair
way
and
come
on
daddy
road
at
one
point
we
have
a
bright
red
amphibious
automobile
the
kid
would
invite
their
friend
to
a
picnic
and
then
amaze
them
by
have
me
drive
them
across
the
water
to
a
small
island
about
two
hundred
yard
offshore
on
some
project
i
really
get
carry
away
on
a
hill
by
the
water
be
a
chinese
junk
i
bought
it
on
a
trip
to
hong
kong
and
have
it
transport
to
maine
but
it
turn
out
to
be
dreadfully
hard
to
sail
and
the
kid
didn
t
like
it
so
we
haul
it
out
of
the
water
and
put
it
up
on
block
as
an
ornament
on
top
of
another
hill
be
a
fifty
foot
totem
pole
the
handiwork
of
an
itinerant
native
american
who
call
himself
chief
kickpou
i
ran
across
him
in
canada
one
year
and
although
i
be
never
clear
what
tribe
he
come
from
i
thought
he
be
a
charm
man
he
talk
me
into
let
him
bring
his
assistant
and
carve
a
totem
pole
for
us
after
a
while
it
seem
lonely
on
its
hilltop
so
on
a
trip
to
colorado
i
found
life
size
bronze
statue
of
plain
indian
squaw
grind
maize
and
set
those
up
in
the
tall
weed
near
the
base
i
thought
of
chief
kickpou
s
totem
pole
as
a
monument
to
fast
talk
salesman
everywhere
olive

we
could
travel
make
a
tremendous
impression
on

i
thought
it
be
one
of
the
most
important
thing
we
could
provide
here
i
pattern
myself
after
dad
i
remember
his
take

on
automobile
caravan
in
the
early
day
to
place
like
niagara
fall
and
washington

and
i
never
hesitate
to
pluck
a
child
out
of

it
look
as
if
a
trip
might
do

ibm
and
take
my
family
on
a
major
journey
i
put

much
work
and
thought
into
those
trip
as
i
do
into
major
business

for
month
beforehand
the
kid
would

the
din
room
table
and
study
book
about
the
place
we
be
go
to
see
the
first
thing
i
do
be
introduce
the
kid
to
america
i
rent
an
ibm
airplane
and
flew
them
myself
from
white
plain
to
california
and
back
with
many
stop
i
go
down
low
over
the
grain
field
so
they
could
see
how
flat
it
be
i
take
them
over
the
center
of
the
rockies
when
we
stop
in
la
vega
for
fuel
they
all
ran
into
the
depot
and
start
play
the
slot
machine
until
the
owner
come
out
to
tell
me
they
be
too
young
to
gamble
olive
be
the
best
possible
partner
on
these
adventure
she
be
a
good
sport
about
the
inconvenience
and
quite
intrepid
when
thing
go
wrong
there
be
the
afternoon
i
decide
to
show
the
family
the
grand
canyon
the
plane
be
bounce
around
because
of
air
turbulence
and
the
young
child
get
sick
jeannette
still
remembers
the
scene
of
me
at
the
control
point
out
the
beautiful
scene
zoom
by
and
olive
in
the
back
of
the
plane
hold
airsickness
bag
for
two
child
at
once
she
be
a
real
trouper
i
d
use
every
tool
at
hand
imagination
money
dad
s
old
connection
to
make
these
trip
memorable
for
the
kid
our
first
big
international
journey
be
in
the
summer
of
when
i
left
ibm
for
six
week
and
take
the
family
across
sweden
in
a
boat
sail
the
goeta
canal
and
up
and
down
the
baltic
sail
give
me
almost
as
much
pleasure
as
fly
and
our
boat
be
a
new
fifty
four
foot
yawl
that
i
d
commission
from
the
famous
bremen
yacht
maker
abeking
rasmussen
we
picked
up
the
boat
at
the
shipyard
and
christen
her
palawan
after
a
beautiful
island
in
the
philippine
that
i
visit
during
the
war
the
conventional
wisdom
in
yacht
be
that
you
can
t
have
a
comfortable
family
boat
that
be
also
a
good
racer
but
to
a
degree
the
palawan
be
both
the
next
year
i
sail
her
to
my
first
major
yacht
victory
in
a
new
york
yacht
club
race
around
long
island
olive
and
i
work
hard
to
organize
everything
on
the
boat
down
to
the
food
list
and
duty
schedule
we
d
both
be
to
sweden
before
but
none
of
the
kid
knew
what
to
expect
palawan
quickly
turn
into
a
float
picture
of
life
with
child
and
we
d
be
see
pull
into
port
with
kid
laundry
hung
out
to
dry
along
the
railing
of
our
elegant
new
yacht
the
town
we
visit
be
very
safe
so
olive
and
i
let
the
kid
take
the
bicycle
we
d
brought
along
and
explore
by
themselves
even
little
susan
who
be
only
four
struck
out
on
her
own
olive
would
tell
her
we
need
milk
and
she
d
take
a
small
pail
and
march
to
the
near
store
one
thing
that
surprised
the
kid
be
sweden
s
sensuality
the
swede
love
to
take
off
their
clothes
when
the
sun
shine
and
the
sight
of
people
swim
nude
amaze
our
four
proper
daughter
not
to
mention
my
son
the
joke
on
the
boat
be
that
the
two
tom
be
always
race
each
other
for
the
binoculars
the
only
piece
of
ibm
equipment
we
have
on
board
palawan
be
a
dictation
machine
the
typewriter
division
be
make
them
by
then
and
we
use
it
to
keep
a
log
of
our
trip
each
family
member
be
responsible
for
one
day
of
the
week
i
make
a
game
of
it
hold
the
microphone
up
to
the
little
one
and
ask
question
i
also
take
hundred
of
picture
and
when
we
get
back
those
go
into
a
scrapbook
with
typed
up
excerpt
from
the
dictation
tape
as
a
caption
under
each
one
the
trip
be
such
a
success
that
we
later
make
equally
ambitious
journey
to
israel
greece
and
japan
but
these
travel
be
also
a
good
example
of
how
my
tendency
to
be
dictatorial
undermined
my
effectiveness
as
a
father
i
would
go
to
enormous
trouble
to
plan
a
trip
but
then
defeat
my
own
purpose
by
fail
to
sell
the
idea
to
the
kid
instead
of
ask
if
they
want
to
go
i
simply
order
them
to
do
it
in
retrospect
it
seem
to
me
it
would
have
be
so
easy
to
build
up
slowly
to
an
idea
by
say
something
like
you
know
there
be
a
canal
that
run
across
sweden
and
then
the
next
day
gee
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
on
that
canal
until
the
kid
get
excite
and
clamor
to
go
but
instead
i
d
announce
i
ve
book
seat
on
twa
this
june
and
here
s
what
we
re
go
to
do
the
one
place
on
earth
where
i
felt
free
to
forget
i
be
head
of
anything
and
just
have
fun
be
europe
for
two
week
each
winter
olive
and
i
would
take
time
off
and
go
skiing
in
the
alp
without
the
kid
we
d
travel
in
a
group
of
perhaps
ten
friend
my
favorite
resort
town
be
kitzb
hel
and
davos
kitzb
hel
especially
because
of
the
beautiful
zither
music
played
there
which
i
love
we
d
ski
all
day
and
at
night
there
be
party
in
the
small
restaurant
in
the
village
and
sometimes
on
the
top
of
an
alp
it
cost
almost
nothing
to
get
the
cog
railroad
to
run
a
single
car
load
with
friend
up
the
mountain
for
the
even
the
music
would
play
the
sweet
austrian
wine
would
flow
and
we
d
go
back
down
the
mountain
afterward
fill
with
romance
and
with
beautiful
old
alpine
dance
still
ring
in
our
ear
europe
be
the
province
of
ibm
world
trade
of
course
my
brother
s
territory
and
not
mine
but
i
have
occasion
once
or
twice
each
year
to
go
there
on
business
all
the
same
dick
and
i
always
found
time
to
break
away
and
this
lead
to
some
of
the
best
moment
we
ever
have
together
one
even
in
the
late
s
he
and
i
flew
into
berlin
with
wiz
miller
we
have
an
appointment
the
next
morning
to
see
willy
brandt
the
prominent
social
democrat
who
be
then
mayor
of
the
city
and
later
chancellor
of
west
germany
nightclub
of
course
be
berlin
s
great
attraction
and
none
of
us
felt
like
stay
in
our
hotel
study
our
note
for
the
meeting
so
we
go
out
on
the
town
we
saw
a
couple
of
unusual
cabaret
show
and
end
up
in
a
famous
nightclub
in
which
each
table
have
a
number
prominently
displayed
and
a
telephone
the
idea
be
that
if
you
saw
a
girl
you
like
across
the
room
you
could
call
and
introduce
yourself
dick
and
wiz
and
i
have
a
fantastic
time
watch
this
scene
and
we
manage
to
stay
out
almost
until
dawn
without
do
anything
scandalous
but
the
next
morning
be
very
confuse
none
of
us
remember
to
leave
a
call
at
the
desk
and
when
i
woke
up
we
have
less
than
half
an
hour
before
we
be
suppose
to
meet
with
brandt
i
d
never
see
three
people
put
on
white
shirt
so
fast
we
race
across
town
in
a
taxi
quarrel
about
whose
fault
it
be
that
we
d
overslept
the
meeting
with
the
mayor
come
off
well
so
no
harm
be
do
to
watson
family
honor
but
i
kept
wonder
what
dad
would
have
thought
in
the
middle
of
i
heard
on
the
radio
that
nikita
khrushchev
be
come
to
visit
the
united
state
i
thought
of
a
surefire
way
to
make
ibm
stand
out
we
could
give
him
a
tour
of
one
of
our
factory
before
send
an
invitation
i
call
the
state
department
to
make
sure
i
wasn
t
violate
diplomatic
protocol
an
official
who
be
help
to
plan
khrushchev
s
stay
get
on
the
phone
we
d
like
to
invite
the
premier
to
visit
ibm
i
told
him
do
the
state
department
have
any
problem
with
that
he
say
no
problem
but
he
won
t
come
i
sent
a
wire
directly
to
khrushchev
at
the
kremlin
it
say
i
d
like
very
much
to
show
you
an
advanced
electronics
plant
we
have
such
plant
in
poughkeepsie
new
york
and
san
jose
california
we
can
make
your
visit
as
brief
as
you
like
but
we
recommend
that
if
you
want
to
get
a
feel
for
the
product
and
the
people
who
make
it
you
come
in
the
morning
and
stay
for
lunch
i
heard
nothing
for
several
week
we
pull
some
string
but
never
expect
it
to
work
then
gav
cullen
the
head
of
the
san
jose
plant
call
me
and
say
what
be
you
try
to
do
to
me
what
do
you
mean
i
ve
get
two
soviet
lieutenant
general
here
who
want
to
check
out
the
plant
that
be
how
i
learn
khrushchev
have
say
yes
i
d
be
to
moscow

try
to

the

other
evidence

prosperity
one
of
the

all
the
late
appliance
where
khrushchev
and
vice
president
richard
nixon
have
their
famous
kitchen
debate
the
issue
be
whether

to
fool
russian
by
display

no
ordinary
american
could
afford

spite
of
all
the
tension
between
our
two
country
i
found
it
an
amaze
experience
to

him
the
business
community
held
back
partly
on

people
have
be
criticize
for

all
sort
of
potential
problem
and
incident
i
want
to
avoid
for
example
ibm
have
lead
american
industry
in
hire
refugee
after
khrushchev
crush
the
hungarian
revolution
i
realize
that
some
of
our
employee
must
hate
him
and
i
want
to
make
sure
there
be
no
provocation
from
our
side
so
i
post
a
notice
on
the
factory
bulletin
board
that
say
my
invitation
to
premier
khrushchev
be
not
an
endorsement
of
his
regime
i
think
the
interest
of
the
united
state
will
be
advanced
by
his
visit
anybody
who
object
to
his
presence
can
have
two
day
off
with
pay
i
figure
offering
only
one
day
wasn
t
enough
to
get
potential
troublemaker
to
leave
about
twenty
employee
take
me
up
on
the
offer
the
computer
demonstration
we
plan
for
khrushchev
be
pretty
dramatic
we
have
the
ramac
programmed
to
work
like
an
electronic
history
book
you
could
ask
it
in
any
of
ten
language
for
the
major
event
of
any
year
from
b
c
to
the
present
of
course
some
year
be
not
as
eventful
as
others
but
we
have
something
for
each
year
if
you
say
a
d
for
example
the
machine
would
type
out
salome
ask
for
and
receive
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
and
more
to
the
point
if
you
say
it
would
reply
the
russian
revolution
this
demonstration
be
dear
to
my
heart
because
i
d
thought
it
up
myself
the
fellow
we
picked
to
put
the
ramac
through
its
pace
be
a
tough
polish
immigrant
from
our
los
angeles
office
who
spoke
fluent
russian
he
call
himself
eddie
corwin
but
i
knew
him
from
sale
school
in
when
he
be
still
eddie
sochaczewski
when
hitler
invade
poland
eddie
fought
in
the
polish
cavalry
get
capture
in
the
first
week
of
fight
and
make
it
through
six
year
in
a
nazi
pow
camp
a
couple
of
day
before
khrushchev
come
i
be
in
the
plant
go
over
the
schedule
and
i
ask
eddie
how
long
will
your
demonstration
take
about
fifteen
minute
include
question
but
we
have
twenty
minute
allot
to
this
what
about
the
other
five
he
look
me
right
in
the
eye
and
say
i
m
go
to
talk
about
the
plight
of
polish
exile
in
the
soviet
union
i
say
eddie
you
know
you
can
t
do
that
it
s
very
important
to
me
khrushchev
be
go
to
be
our
guest
unless
i
have
your
word
of
honor
you
won
t
do
it
i
can
t
let
you
give
the
demonstration
he
look
aside
scowl
and
finally
agree
so
i
kept
him
in
the
program
khrushchev
start
out
on
the
east
coast
and
go
on
to
los
angeles
i
follow
all
the
tv
and
newspaper
report
and
wonder
what
i
be
get
us
into
he
trade
insult
with
the
press
corp
in
washington
be
rude
to
eleanor
roosevelt
at
her
home
and
almost
cause
an
international
incident
when
the
mayor
of
los
angeles
told
him
that
he
couldn
t
go
to
disneyland
because
of
the
security
risk
accord
to
the
paper
khrushchev
pound
on
a
banquet
table
and
say
why
not
do
you
have
rocket
launch
pad
there
be
there
an
epidemic
of
cholera
or
something
have
gangster
take
hold
of
the
place
the
situation
be
inconceivable
i
cannot
find
word
to
explain
this
to
my
people
i
begin
to
worry
that
he
d
use
ibm
as
a
platform
for
denounce
the
american
way
of
life
day
and
night
i
imagine
situation
in
which
khrushchev
would
say
something
insult
and
i
d
have
to
find
the
proper
diplomatic
response
but
after
los
angeles
there
be
an
amaze
shift
of
tone
somehow
he
and
the
american
warm
to
one
another
khrushchev
s
message
stayed
the
same
but
suddenly
his
manner
change
he
be
all
smile
he
checked
into
a
san
francisco
hotel
and
a
huge
crowd
cheer
when
he
come
to
the
window
and
wave
the
next
morning
on
the
way
to
see
us
he
cause
bedlam
by
make
a
spur
of
the
moment
visit
to
a
san
francisco
supermarket
and
then
stop
off
unannounced
at
a
hire
hall
for
the
longshoreman
s
union
finally
it
be
our
turn
his
motorcade
pull
in
just
before
lunch
and
there
be
the
premier
a
funny
little
round
man
in
a
rumple
tan
suit
he
have
on
a
bright
white
longshoreman
s
cap
that
he
d
just
swap
his
own
hat
for
at
the
hire
hall
his
official
escort
be
henry
cabot
lodge
the
u
s
ambassador
to
the
united
nation
whom
i
knew
slightly
with
them
be
dozen
of
official
from
both
side
and
a
crush
of
newsman
olive
and
i
come
forward
to
say
hello
to
him
mr
khrushchev
have
stayed
in
san
francisco
to
do
some
shopping
and
we
escort
him
into
the
plant
khrushchev
love
to
eat
and
what
broke
the
ice
be
the
fact
that
we
d
arrange
thing
so
that
lunch
come
first
earlier
that
week
i
d
carefully
instruct
the
caterer
who
ran
our
cafeteria
we
want
to
show
khrushchev
a
typical
day
at
the
plant
no
special
arrangement
serve
an
average
lunch
the
caterer
stuck
to
the
usual
menu
but
somehow
he
produce
the
damnedest
cafeteria
meal
i
d
ever
see
beautiful
california
salad
and
an
array
of
cold
meat
that
would
have
grace
the
waldorf
i
give
khrushchev
a
tray
take
one
for
myself
and
we
go
through
the
self
service
line
the
practice
there
be
to
restrict
the
quantity
you
could
take
from
the
buffet
by
use
plate
and
bowl
that
be
pretty
small
that
didn
t
stop
khrushchev
as
we
go
along
i
notice
he
be
heap
his
bowl
with
more
and
more
food
i
be
determine
not
to
smile
because
there
be
photographer
all
around
and
i
thought
it
would
make
a
horribly
embarrass
picture
me
laugh
at
him
but
khrushchev
must
have
be
reading
my
mind
he
get
his
bowl
pile
three
or
four
inch
high
and
then
glance
up
at
me
and
give
a
pert
little
smile
which
cause
me
to
burst
out
laugh
of
course
the
new
york
time
clicked
it
and
we
make
the
paper
the
follow
day
lunch
seem
to
put
the
premier
in
a
happy
mood
you
be
well
verse
in
psychology
he
say
to
me
you
start
off
our
acquaintance
by
take
me
to
this
din
room
his
interpreter
viktor
sukhodrev
be
so
much
well
than
the
guy
i
d
brought
in
from
the
united
nation
that
the
un
guy
couldn
t
get
a
word
in
edgewise
i
didn
t
mind
because
it
be
obvious
that
sukhodrev
be
give
faithful
translation
later
on
when
we
tour
the
plant
khrushchev
say
we
have
plant
like
this
in
the
soviet
union
then
he
look
a
little
puzzle
and
say
half
to
himself
we
must
have
plant
like
this
in
the
soviet
union
why
sukhodrev
didn
t
leave
that
one
untranslated
i
never
knew
khrushchev
be
constantly
put
his
hand
on
people
in
the
brief
time
he
spent
walk
through
the
plant
he
manage
to
make
a
personal
impression
on
every
employee
there
my
father
be
the
only
other
man
i
ever
knew
who
could
affect
a
large
crowd
that
way
we
have
the
entire
tour
precisely
schedule
and
choreographed
but
khrushchev
broke
away
in
the
middle
of
the
factory
floor
and
go
up
to
a
couple
of
worker
what
type
of
work
do
you
do
he
ask
each
man
what
be
your
salary
how
much
do
you
spend
for
grocery
be
this
a
typical
wage
here
the
russian
have
launch
a
successful
moon
probe
call
lunik
and
khrushchev
start
pin
lunik
medal
on
people
after
he
go
by
you
would
see
the
worker
pull
those
medal
off
and
look
at
them
some
of
them
put
their
medal
back
on
and
some
of
them
say
that
s
o
b
and
pitch
them
in
the
ashcan
we
step
up
in
front
of
microphone
and
khrushchev
thanked
us
for
the
warm
welcome
we
d
give
him
then
he
make
what
be
widely
report
as
the
most
amicable
remark
of
his
u
s
stay
say
that
russia
want
to
be
friend
with
the
american
people
and
the
american
government
and
that
he
drew
no
line
of
distinction
between
the
two
there
be
only
one
insinuation
in
his
speech
that
i
didn
t
like
he
say
whenever
we
meet
with
businessmen
we
have
no
conflict
with
each
another
but
often
when
i
meet
for
instance
with
trade
union
leader
or
some
politician
it
turn
out
that
matter
be
not
so
smooth
i
thought
this
be
a
veil
insult
to
eisenhower
who
have
just
put
him
through
three
day
of
tough
talk
at
camp
david
on
the
subject
of
berlin
much
as
i
want
to
be
a
good
host
i
couldn
t
let
that
ride
so
after
he
finish
i
say
lady
and
gentleman
the
chairman
attribute
to
me
a
peaceful
tone
but
this
tone
be
set
by
president
eisenhower
not
me
to
my
great
relief
khrushchev
didn
t
pursue
the
matter
far
so
there
be
no
sequel
in
the
ibm
cafeteria
to
nixon
s
kitchen
debate
i
be
intrigue
at
the
thought
of
become
a
prominent
figure
on
the
national
scene
not
that
i
be
look
for
a
political
career
i
wasn
t
at
least
not
then
but
i
want
to
be
know
as
a
citizen
who
could
come
to
washington
and
do
a
job
for
the
government
just
as
successfully
as
i
ran
ibm
government
service
be
an
opportunity
to
go
beyond
what
my
father
have
accomplish
although
he
d
be
close
to
roosevelt
and
help
organize
the
business
advisory
council
dad
be
generally
so
busy
with
ibm
and
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
that
he
restrict
his
government
activity
to
ceremonial
job
i
on
the
other
hand
like
the
prospect
of
get
actively
involve
and
go
to
washington
regularly
and
i
wasn
t
bother
by
another
consideration
that
may
have
held
dad
back
when
a
businessman
even
a
very
successful
businessman
at
the
peak
of
his
career
step
out
of
his
company
and
take
on
a
task
for
the
government
he
give
up
much
of
his
power
and
becomes
a
novice
all
over
again
that
would
have
have
no
appeal
to
dad
who
above
everything
else
love
to
rule
the
roost
at
ibm
but
i
be
still
quite
a
young
man
and
didn
t
mind
be
see
as
an
amateur
as
long
as
i
could
learn
as
one
of
the
few
liberal
in
the
business
community
in
the
late
s
i
be
often
surprised
by
the
amount
of
controversy
i
stir
up
and
i
enjoy
it
two
month
after
khrushchev
s
visit
for
example
i
give
a
speech
to
the
national
association
of
manufacturer
at
the
waldorf
and
shock
them
with
a
call
for
high
tax
i
point
out
that
more
money
be
probably
essential
if
we
expect
to
stay
ahead
of
the
soviet
we
must
realize
that
some
sacrifice
be
necessary
we
can
t
do
all
the
thing
necessary
for
the
united
state
to
do
in
this
country
and
abroad
and
still
proceed
on
the
business
as
usual
basis
one
of
our
first
sacrifice
must
be
a
willingness
to
accept
high
tax
if
necessary
in
order
to
accomplish
our
purpose
of
keep
america
ahead
of
the
world
on
all
count
i
have
arrange
to
leave
right
after
the
speech
without
ever
go
back
into
the
audience
i
step
down
from
the
podium
go
out
the
back
door
into
a
wait
car
and
be
off
on
a
trip
to
europe
immediately
it
wasn
t
until
later
that
i
found
out
what
an
uproar
my
speech
cause
the
next
morning
there
be
front
page
story
in
the
time
and
herald
tribune
n
a
m
tax
stand
hit
by
watson
assails
business
as
usual
view
the
president
of
the
organization
even
call
a
press
conference
where
he
claimed
that
i
d
meant
the
opposite
of
what
i
d
say
the
official
national
association
of
manufacturer
position
of
course
be
that
congress
should
indeed
try
to
increase
federal
revenue

victory
transform
my
status
in
the
business
world
in
the

way
that
roosevelt
transform
dad
s
before
kennedy
most
businessmen
saw
me
as
a
character
on
the
liberal
fringe
and
more
or
less
tolerate
my
opinion
because
of
ibm
s
success
now
all
of
a
sudden
i
have
a
chance
to
become
a
much
big
fish
the
business
advisory
council
for
instance
advanced
me
from
oblivion
to
the
office
of
vice
chairman

i
soon
found
myself

to
be
a
peacemaker
between
big
business
and
the
white
house
the
kennedy

big
embrace

up
and
down
the
stair
and
across
a

and
we
d
show
movie
their
kid
be
all
full
of
bean
but
nice
when
we
have
a
party

kennedy
love
the
same
foolish
funny
game
we
do
i
didn
t
meet
jack
kennedy
until
when
we
ran
into
each
other
on
the
air
shuttle
to
washington
i
introduce
myself
and
we
chat
about
his
family
and
mine
over
the
year
i
d
heard
jack
praise
so
much
by
my
wife
and
his
sister
that
i
felt
some
resistance
to
him
but
any
reservation
i
have
evaporate
very
fast
when
i
saw
him
debate
nixon
on
television
after
the
second
debate
i
be
sure
he
be
go
to
win
the
election
i
write
him
a
letter
that
say
i
be
for
you
one
of
his
aide
call
to
ask
if
i
would
declare
my
support
to
the
press
since
i
be
chairman
of
a
corporation
that
do
a
lot
of
business
with
both
democrat
and
republican
i
say
no
but
i
told
the
kennedy
people
i
d
make
no
secret
of
who
i
be
voting
for
and
if
they
want
to
spread
the
word
they
could
i
work
hard
for
kennedy
s
election
by
make
gift
write
letter
and
personally
try
to
drum
up
support
he
be
so
unpopular
in
the
corporate
world
that
the
business
people
who
learn
what
i
be
do
thought
i
have
lose
my
mind
before
election
day
olive
and
i
go
to
a
meeting
of
the
business
advisory
council
and
found
it
difficult
even
to
engage
anyone
in
conversation
they
be
so
put
out
i
be
delighted
when
he
won
and
get
a
little
carry
away
in
my
enthusiasm
when
i
address
the
hundred
percent
club
that
winter
i
have
to
hold
my
tongue
prior
to
the
election
i
told
our
salesman
but
now
that
kennedy
be
president
of
all
the
people
i
m
free
to
speak
i
think
you
will
agree
that
we
should
congratulate
ourselves
because
we
have
elect
a
terrific
president
this
remark
produce
dozen
of
complaint
from
young
hundred
percenters
who
invite
me
to
keep
my
political
view
to
myself
somehow
i
d
lose
sight
of
a
basic
fact
of
human
nature
if
a
fellow
start
out
poor
work
his
way
through
college
and
quickly
make
a
lot
of
money
he
turn
ultra
conservative
a
bright
young
ibm
salesman
could
earn
twenty
five
thousand
dollar
a
year
within
five
year
of
start
out
big
money
in
those
day
i
be
fooling
myself
to
think
i
be
head
of
a
corporation
of
liberal
i
realize
that
if
i
want
to
be
in
politics
i
might
as
well
quit
and
if
i
want
to
be
chairman
of
ibm
i
have
to
button
my
lip
there
be
never
any
question
about
where
i
stood
politically
but
i
didn
t
make
any
more
public
statement
about
it
olive
and
i
start
get
invitation
to
the
white
house
as
though
we
live
next
door
some
of
the
social
occasion
we
go
to
be
historic
i
remember
the
dinner
where
pablo
casals
perform
it
be
his
first
formal
recital
in
the
united
state
since

m
my
wife

on
the
president
s
right
that
night
which
alone
be
sufficient
to
make
the
even
a
permanent
part
of
our
family
s
lore
during
the
kennedy
year
i
have
my
chance
to
learn
my
way
around
washington
i
work
on
a
half
dozen
of
his
committee
and
commission
include
the
advisory
committee
on

management
policy
and
the
steer
committee

corp
i
be
pleased
and
proud
to
serve
the
president
in
any
way
i
could
but
i
didn
t
delude
myself
that
i
be
play
that
important
a
role
or
that
i
be
a
real
political
animal
mainly
i
be
a
witness
most
big
businessmen
oppose
kennedy
of
course
he
hadn
t
even
be
in
the
white
house
six
month
when
the
business
council
broke
off
its
formal
relationship
with
the
government
i
get
involve
in
that
fight
which
destroyed
an
arrangement
that
have
exist
since
roosevelt
the
council
consist
of
sixty
five
of
the
most
powerful
businessmen
in
america
its
official
purpose
be
to
advise
the
secretary
of
commerce
on
economic
issue
but
its
real
usefulness
have
be
in
time
of
crisis
when
america
join
world
war
ii
for
example
the
business
council
have
the
war
production
board
staffed
within
a
matter
of
day
in
peacetime
there
wasn
t
that
much
for
the
business
council
to
do
and
it
become
more
of
an
old
boy
club
kennedy
s
secretary
of
commerce
be
luther
hodges
the
former
governor
of
north
carolina
a
genial
liberal
twenty
year
old
than
the
president
when
he
be
first
appoint
everybody
figure
hodges
would
appeal
to
both
businessmen
and
congress
but
underneath
that
charm
exterior
be
a
real
stubborn
old
coot
hodges
decide
big
business
and
the
government
have
gotten
too
cozy
under
eisenhower
and
that
he
be
go
to
put
a
stop
to
it
he
told
the
business
council
chairman
that
he
didn
t
think
the
organization
be
truly
representative
of
american
business
that
shock
everybody
then
he
forbade
us
to
hold
close
door
session
with
federal
official
and
demand
that
representative
from
small
business
be
make
member
before
long
a
lot
of
ill
will
be
building
up
i
be
by
no
mean
entirely
in
love
with
the
business
council
member
would
go
to
those
meeting
at
hot
spring
with
a
list
of
five
deal
they
want
to
discus
there
would
be
golf
game
all
afternoon
a
perfect
forum
for
cooking
up
business
deal
and
when
it
come
to
question
of
government
they
all
thought
alike
they
be
against
any
federal
control
but
in
spite
of
all
this
i
thought
it
be
foolish
to
destroy
an
organization
that
be
so
important
in
emergency
and
i
couldn
t
see
why
hodges
would
want
to
alienate
the
business
community
when
he
be
suppose
to
speak
for
it
with
the
berlin
wall
crisis
develop
in
i
m
sure
luther
hodges
be
far
from
the
most
press
problem
on
the
president
s
mind
all
the
same
i
go
to
see
kennedy
when
the
business
council
start
talk
about
end
its
affiliation
with
the
commerce
department
i
don
t
think
it
s
particularly
detrimental
to
you
i
say
but
you
might
want
to
take
an
active
hand
rather
than
just
let
it
happen
kennedy
call
in
ralph
dungan
one
of
his
special
assistant
and
say
i
have
no
idea
this
thing
have
go
so
far
get
into
it
with
tom
and
get
it
stop
dungan
try
in
every
way
to
get
hodges
to
change
his
position
but
he
wouldn
t
so
on
july
the
business
council
call
a
press
conference
and
divorce
itself
from
the
government
the
only
thing
the
business
council
ever
do
for
kennedy
be
to
supply
volunteer
for
his
foreign
aid
program
i
organize
the
recruiting
effort
which
be
nickname
operation
tycoon
the
united
state
be
give
away
a
great
deal
of
money
abroad
in
those
day
and
kennedy
want
business
people
man
the
foreign
aid
post
the
idea
be
to
get
fifty
company
to
provide
their
best
young
vice
president
and
manager
for
a
year
s
service
abroad
a
kind
of
executive
peace
corp
i
use
the
business
council
to
do
the
job
line
up
four
chief
executive
as
regional
vice
chairman
include
carter
burgess
of
amf
and
steve
bechtel
sr
they
recruit
some
very
talented
men
and
then
we
have
to
wrestle
with
state
department
bureaucrat
who
be
insist
that
to
avoid
conflict
of
interest
the
volunteer
have
to
resign
from
their
corporate
job
before
they
could
go
but
the
spirit
of
the
time
be
so
compelling
that
thirty
five
people
agree
at
some
risk
to
their
career
i
remember
that
the
young
brother
of
bob
ingersoll
head
of
borg
warner
go
to
the
philippine
bill
lawless
of
ibm
who
have
be
al
williams
s
assistant
go
to
zaire
and
another
fellow
from
ibm
name
stan
mcelroy
manage
the
whole
operation
for
me
the
contrast
be
enormous
between
the
business
council
and
the
new
committee
on
labor
management
policy
which
i
also
work
on
the
latter
have
all
the
excitement
of
the
kennedy
era
and
pretty
much
take
over
the
business
council
s
advisory
job
it
consist
of
nineteen
leader
from
business
labor
and
education
people
like
henry
ford
ii
and
joseph
block
george
meany
and
walter
reuther
and
kennedy
himself
come
to
the
meeting
i
really
felt
i
be
walk
with
giant
and
be
amaze
at
the
amount
of
unanimity
we
be
able
to
achieve
the
president
ask
us
to
tackle
the
issue
of
joblessness
which
be
an
enormous
problem
because
a
recession
have
push
the
unemployment
rate
to
its
high
level
since
the
s
on
top
of
that
everybody
be
worry
about
the
baby
boom
how
to
provide
job
for
the
child
we
d
all
have
my
specialty
on
this
panel
be
the
relationship
between
unemployment
and
automation
at
ibm
we
d
always
take
a
fairly
hard
line
on
that
issue
after
all
we
sell
punch
card
machine
on
the
basis
of
how
many
clerk
they
d
replace
dad
justified
this
by
point
out
that
modern
technology
improves
industrial
productivity
which
in
turn
boost
the
economy
creates
job
and
raise
the
standard
of
living
for
everyone
but
now
i
become
conscious
of
the
worker
who
get
put
on
the
street
in
the
process
what
first
woke
me
up
be
a
television
documentary
by
edward
r
murrow
i
appear
in
it
to
explain
the
ibm
point
of
view
but
it
be
the
show
s
opening
scene
that
become
indelibly
imprint
on
my
mind
murrow
start
with
the
meat
packer
in
his
clear
and
forceful
way
he
laid
out
the
background
and
then
he
interviewed
an
unemployed
man
who
be
just
sit
on
his
stoop
the
fellow
have
work
in
a
slaughterhouse
but
his
skill
have
be
replace
by
a
machine
he
be
only
forty
five
or
fifty
but
there
be
nothing
he
could
reapply
himself
to
and
the
disintegration
of
his
morale
come
through
on
the
screen
i
be
stun
by
the
tragedy
of
an
able
man
sit
there
say
he
want
to
work
but
couldn
t
get
a
job
because
the
whole
industry
have
change
walter
reuther
have
a
tremendous
influence
on
me
lot
of
people
call
reuther
a
communist
because
he
and
his
brother
have
work
in
a
soviet
automobile
factory
in
the
early
s
he
be
anything
but
a
communist
i
believe
he
be
one
of
america
s
great
men
and
that
his
death
in
a
plane
crash
in
be
a
tragedy
for
the
country
when
it
come
to
my
education
reuther
picked
up
where
murrow
have
left
off
he
make
me
understand
that
if
buick
decides
to
close
an
obsolete
plant
in
detroit
then
build
a
modern
new
plant
in
the
south
five
thousand
people
be
still
thrown
out
of
work
the
new
job
in
tennessee
don
t
mean
very
much
to
those
worker
in
detroit
conservative
would
probably
argue
that
that
s
part
of
the
free
enterprise
system
and
that
those
family
be
just
the
chaff
that
get
ground
out
while
the
mill
be
work
beautifully
but
i
don
t
think
that
s
right
and
the
labor
management
committee
study
the
method
european
use
to
protect
job
we
talk
at
length
with
the
swede
in
particular
they
have
cooperative
program
involve
industry
labor
and
government
to
recruit
worker
from
section
of
the
country
where
unemployment
be
high
retrain
them
and
move
them
to
area
where
they
be
need
kennedy
be
willing
to
explore
any
idea
for
inspire
a
similar
kind
of
cooperation
in
the
united
state
that
committee
be
my
first
inkling
that
i
eventually
might
be
able
to
accomplish
something
significant
in
government
the
labor
leader
like
me
for
my
liberal
view
the
businessmen
have
respect
for
my
success
and
the
academic
saw
me
as
someone
receptive
to
new
idea
but
i
be
still
only
a
neophyte
and
during
the
first
year
i
learn
that
i
would
have
to
do
a
lot
more
homework
if
i
want
to
be
take
seriously
in
washington
there
be
an
ongoing
debate
in
the
committee
about
how
to
protect
the
average
american
worker
from
unemployment
conservative
take
the
usual
line
want
to
cut
business
tax
in
order
to
stimulate
the
economy
and
produce
more
job
liberal
want
innovative
federal
program
such
as
job
insurance
i
ask
an
ibm
economist
to
write
a
paper
reflect
my
view
and
after
talk
to
me
he
rapidly
produce
a
very
liberal
piece
that
be
where
i
go
wrong
because
instead
of
carefully
reading
the
draft
i
impetuously
sent
it
to
all
the
member
of
the
committee
labor
be
delighted
and
management
appalled
what
my
memo
propose
be
essentially
a
return
to
the
new
deal
henry
ford
s
chief
financial
officer
write
a
scathing
response
that
denounce
my
work
as
spurious
and
without
merit
and
although
i
thought
he
be
be
too
harsh
i
have
to
admit
that
what
i
d
present
be
half
bake
some
of
us
on
the
committee
hop
that
if
labor
and
management
work
together
america
would
develop
way
to
run
its
economy
as
rationally
as
the
swede
ran
theirs
maybe
we
d
have
move
in
that
direction
if
kennedy
have
survive
but
less
than
a
year
after
he
be
shot
the
united
auto
worker
go
on
strike
against
general
motor
and
the
settlement
they
reach
go
against
the
national
interest
to
get
the
auto
worker
back
on
the
job
gm
give
them
a
fat
contract
include
a
pay
raise
far
in
excess
of
the
anti
inflation
guideline
set
by
the
administration
that
be
another
lesson
to
me
i
saw
that
even
when
a
major
union
and
a
major
corporation
agree
it
s
not
necessarily
for
the
best
only
the
power
of
the
federal
government
can
protect
the
common
good
on
the
day
kennedy
die

hand
deliver
to
the
gate
of
the
white
house
the
follow
morning
i
knew
a
letter
like
that
even
if
it
be
just
a
small
thing
can
mean
a
great
deal
to
the
man
who
be
on
the
spot
around
noon
come
another
call
one
of
the
kennedy
staff
ask
olive
and
me
to
come
to
view
the
body
with
the
senator
and
the
supreme
court
everybody
remembers
particular
scene
from
those
day
of
mourn
the
one
that
stick
in
my
mind
be
bobby
kennedy
stand
at
a
turn
in
the
white
house
stair
near
the
east
room
console
people
who
have
just
walk
past
his
brother
s
bier
it
be
a
sympathetic
gesture
that
nobody
expect
from
a
man
under
that
kind
of
strain
bobby
shook
my
hand
and
held
olive
in
a
long
embrace
and
both
of
them
be
cry
johnson
take
over
and
a
number
of
people
told
me
that
he
d
show
them
my
letter
he
carry
it
in
his
pocket
for
week
i
guess
it
be
important
to
him
because
it
prove
he
be
get
the
support
even
of
kennedy
loyalist
but
it
also
express
the
way
i
felt
about
him
because
of
difference
in
our
personality
i
didn
t
think
i
could
work
for
johnson
he
later
ask
me
to
be
his
secretary
of
commerce
and
i
turn
him
down
yet
i
knew
he
would
try
to
push
through
much
of
the
legislation
that
kennedy
have
initiate
and
i
want
to
support
him
in
any
way
i
could
i
have
a
ritual
i
use
to
follow
on
the
anniversary
of
my
father
s
death
i
would
spend
a
quiet
even
take
stock
of
what
ibm
have
accomplish
in
his
absence
and
then
say
to
olive
that
s
another
year
i
ve
make
it
alone
the
last
time
i
do
this
be
on
the
fifth
anniversary
in
by
then
ibm
be
two
and
a
half
time
as
big
as
when
dad
left
it
over
two
billion
dollar
a
year
in
sale
counting
the
result
of
world
trade
and
the
value
of
our
stock
have
quintuple
of
the
six
thousand
computer
in
operation
in
the
united
state
when
begin
well
over
four
thousand
be
ours
and
the
rental
revenue
from
computer
have
grown
until
they
be
about
to
surpass
the
revenue
from
dad
s
beloved
punch
card
machine
for
those
five
year
i
hadn
t
let
anybody
share
the
spotlight
with
me
inside
and
outside
the
company
i
want
to
establish
that
tom
watson
jr
meant
ibm
and
i
guard
my
power
carefully
but
in
i
decide
to
make
room
for
al
williams
by
move
myself
up
to
chairman
remain
chief
executive
and
make
him
president
the
year
have
deepen
our
friendship
to
the
point
where
i
couldn
t
imagine
ever
be
alienate
from
al
despite
the
fact
that
i
be
still
bother
by
dad
s
long
ago
warn
in
early
someone
from
ibm
brought
a
draft
of
our
annual
report
for
me
to
sign
while
i
be
in
washington
for
a
meeting
and
i
saw
that
al
s
signature
be
already
on
it
i
hadn
t
told
him
to
sign
the
annual
report
and
what
i
d
have
in
mind
be
for
him
to
serve
a
full
year
as
president
before
he
do
after
all
dad
have
make
me
wait
three
year
when
i
become
president
in
the
early
s
i
saw
al
s
action
as
a
possible
challenge
to
my
power
and
i
didn
t
want
to
let
it
pas
for
fear
that
it
might
snowball
in
retrospect
i
wonder
if
it
be
really
his
do
at
all
probably
one
of
the
people
prepare
the
annual
report
have
put
in
al
s
name
not
realize
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
but
i
call
al
and
say
look
here
your
signature
be
on
this
annual
report
well
i
m
president
it
ought
to
be
there
that
s
for
me
to
decide
i
m
sure
i
ll
agree
at
some
point
but
it
s
one
of
those
thing
that
s
very
personal
that
make
al
mad
i
don
t
think
there
s
anything
to
decide
at
all
we
d
have
many
business
disagreement
over
the
year
but
this
be
the
first
time
i
felt
we
be
seriously
at
odds
so
i
say
fine
if
you
want
to
pursue
this
assemble
the
board
of
director
for
a
meeting
at
five
thirty
this
afternoon
i
ll
come
back
to
new
york
and
see
you
there
al
be
quiet
and
then
say
let
me
have
fifteen
minute
to
think
about
this
a
little
later
he
call
back
and
say
tom
it
isn
t
worth
fight
about
i
ll
sign
the
annual
report
when
you
think
it
s
right
that
be
the
end
of
it
al
knew
how
to
pick
his
fight
and
he
understood
i
could
beat
him
in
a
boardroom
showdown
i
have
him
sign
the
annual
report
with
me
the
follow
year
and
we
become
even
closer
i
would
gladly
have
run
ibm
in
tandem
with
williams
until
it
be
time
for
us
both
to
retire
but
i
wasn
t
that
lucky
al
be
four
year
old
than
i
and
he
d
make
it
clear
all
along
that
he
be
go
to
retire
early
when
he
reach
fifty
five
i
ve
work
hard
all
my
life
and
i
want
to
have
time
to
enjoy
what
i
ve
earn
he
say
i
didn
t
entirely
believe
he
d
go
through
with
it
but
i
knew
that
come
i
have
to
be
ready
to
name
another
president
the
most
obvious
candidate
be
my
brother
although
dad
have
never
say
so
explicitly
i
have
always
understood
it
be
his
wish
that
dick
should
run
ibm
after
me
he
be
five
year
my
junior
so
if
i
brought
him
in
to
succeed
al
as
president
and
then
step
aside
myself
at
a
reasonable
age
he
d
have
five
or
ten
year
at
the
top
dick
be
in
total
command
of
ibm
world
trade
and
have
built
it
into
a
phenomenal
success
by
it
have
become
a
million
a
year
business
big
than
ibm
domestic
when
i
take
over
as
president
and
he
be
make
it
grow
at
double
the
domestic
rate
thanks
to
his
hard
work
and
dad
s
foresight
we
be
one
of
the
few
american
company
in
a
position
to
cash
in
on
the
european
economic
miracle
between
and
williams
and
i
provide
dick
with
ten
of
million
of
dollar
of
extra
capital
to
finance
world
trade
s
growth
al
use
to
chuckle
about
the
impact
this
would
eventually
have
on
our
u
s
competitor
they
re
fight
us
so
hard
here
that
they
re
not
even
think
about
overseas
wait
until
they
find
out
how
thoroughly
world
trade
have
gotten
itself
entrench
just
as
dad
envision
my
brother
s
charm
and
skill
as
a
diplomat
serve
ibm
well
abroad
dick
be
a
merry
fellow
who
make
friend
effortlessly
he
far
outshone
me
in
ease
and
grace
and
unlike
me
be
comfortable
rub
elbow
with
the
leader
of
government
or
other
business
capitalize
on
his
linguistic
ability
he
make
his
way
smoothly
and
rapidly
in
the
center
of
commerce
of
south
america
and
the
far
east
there
be
no
head
of
major
country
in
europe
whom
dick
didn
t
know
and
willy
brandt
the
mayor
of
west
berlin
have
become
a
particularly
good
friend
within
the
business
dick
have
the
deft
touch
it
take
to
run
a
widely
disperse
operation
like
world
trade
he
set
high
standard
chose
good
people
as
country
manager
and
give
world
trade
the
flexibility
it
need
to
bend
to
the
custom
of
the
ninety
country
it
be
in
yet
dick
didn
t
hesitate
to
buck
tradition
that
ran
contrary
to
good
business
sense
ibm
stood
out
among
european
company
for
example
by
be
willing
to
promote
talented
young
executive
over
the
head
of
their
elder
dick
be
also
not
afraid
to
fight
when
a
government
make
unreasonable
demand
around
japan
give
an
ultimatum
to
foreign
company
do
business
on
its
soil
either
sell
a
percent
interest
in
their
operation
to
japanese
investor
or
get
out
every
american
company
in
japan
capitulate
except
for
texas
instrument
and
ibm
world
trade
my
brother
told
me
the
japanese
need
the
data
processing
industry
too
much
to
make
us
leave
after
year
of
jawboning
the
government
finally
agree
to
let
our
subsidiary
alone
as
a
result
we
be
always
a
major
force
in
the
japanese
computer
market
to
some
degree
dick
and
i
have
outgrown
our
rivalry
after
dad
s
death
at
williamsburg
i
make
him
a
member
of
the
corporate
management
committee
which
be
ibm
s
ruling
council
later
when
mother
have
her
seventy
fifth
birthday
and
retire
from
the
board
of
director
i
ask
dick
to
take
her
place
i
still
follow
the
practice
of
not
meddling
in
dick
s
business
when
he
ask
me
to
join
the
world
trade
board
i
decline
because
i
didn
t
want
to
breathe
down
his
neck
but
the
organizational
split
between
our
two
company
which
have
be
quite
useful
at
first
now
seem
more
like
a
formality
outside
of
work
dick
and
i
have
never
be
closer
and
we
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
with
mother
now
that
she
be
slow
down
dick
built
her
a
summer
house
on
his
property
in
new
canaan
and
for
a
couple
of
month
each
year
he
and
i
live
there
with
her
while
our
wife
and
child
spent
the
summer
in
maine
those
be
warm
funny
time
mother
and
dick
be
particularly
close
he
be
her
young
child
and
he
d
take
her
on
long
trip
include
one
to
australia
to
look
up
a
long
lose
branch
of
the
watson
family
i
never
travel
with
her
but
she
confide
in
me
in
a
way
she
never
have
while
dad
be
alive
share
her
worry
about
this
or
that
member
of
the
family
what
meant
the
most
to
me
be
that
she
thought
i
be
do
a
superior
job
run
ibm
she
d
say
if
your
father
be
alive
how
proud
he
d
be
she
and
dick
and
i
would
chat
every
morning
over
breakfast
and
then
dick
and
i
would
drive
to
work
together
on
the
tree
line
back
road
of
westchester
county
to
armonk
where
ibm
have
recently
move
its
headquarters
mother
have
always
love
to
drive
and
as
a
surprise
dick
and
i
bought
her
a
jaguar
convertible
she
drove
it
around
with
the
top
down
until
she
be
eighty
and
could
hardly
see
anybody
in
new
canaan
when
they
saw
that
jaguar
come
would
get
behind
a
tree
now
that
we
d
reach
a
point
where
it
be
natural
to
set
up
the
ibm
succession
al
williams
push
me
to
make
the
first
move
we
ve
get
to
get
dick
over
from
world
trade
he
say
our
plan
be
to
groom
my
brother
just
as
dad
have
groom
me
and
we
figure
he
would
need
a
couple
of
year
in
a
big
job
on
the
domestic
side
to
establish
his
authority
then
he
d
be
ready
to
take
al
s
place
and
eventually
mine
i
talk
to
my
brother
about
it
in
you
re
do
great
at
world
trade
i
say
dad
always
predict
it
would
be
big
than
the
main
company
and
maybe
he
have
a
point
but
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
you
re
also
the
number
one
candidate
for
this
top
job
so
tell
me
what
you
d
prefer
do
you
want
to
stay
with
world
trade
and
be
the
great
internationalist
or
do
you
want
to
get
in
the
run
to
be
chief
executive
i
thought
i
be
be
scrupulously
fair
but
in
hindsight
it
be
the
bad
business
and
family
mistake
i
ever
make
i
should
never
have
force
my
brother
into
a
horse
race
with
other
executive
for
the
top
job
and
it
would
have
be
well
for
everybody
if
he
d
say
i
ll
make
no
such
choice
you
decide
whether
you
want
me
to
succeed
you
and
when
you
re
ready
to
make
an
offer
i
ll
consider
it
instead
dick
ask
what
i
have
in
mind
for
him
i
told
him
i
d
bring
him
in
at
the
level
of
senior
vice
president
and
that
meanwhile
he
would
keep
the
title
of
chairman
of
ibm
world
trade
although
somebody
else
would
actually
run
that
business
he
say
i
d
like
to
think
about
it
overnight
when
you
offer
a
career
opportunity
to
a
man
who
have
ambition
he
ll
always
take
the
job
dick
come
back
the
next
day
and
say
if
there
s
a
chance
of
my
run
this
company
i
want
to
try
while
all
this
be
go
on
we
d
be
get
ready
to
announce
a
new
family
of
computer
that
be
radically
different
from
anything
that

ever
be
built

new
line

after

we

this

ibm

bill
it
as
the
most
crucial

portentous
as
well
as
perhaps
the
riskiest

of

along

and
my

we

all
over

it
possible
for

to
book
airline
seat
without
have
to
put
up
with
the
traditional
overnight
wait
for
confirmation
we
could
imagine
much
broader
horizon
ahead

idea
that
appeal

in

visionary
begin
talk
about
the
day
when
computer
power
would
be
deliver
to
home
just
like
telephone
service
and
electricity
paradoxically
there
also
be
a
feel
in
the
early
s
that
ibm
have
reach
a
plateau
we
be
still
expand
but
less
quickly
than
before
in
the
year
kennedy
beat
nixon
for
example
we
only
grow
nine
percent
as
we
reach
the
two
billion
dollar
a
year
mark
people
begin
to
speculate
that
we
d
gotten
so
big
that
naturally
our
growth
rate
have
to
fall
but
give
the
bright
prospect
for
compute
that
seem
illogical
and
i
thought
it
be
probably
our
own
fault
that
we
be
slow
down
the
two
separate
computer
division
i
d
create
be
compete
with
each
other
fiercely
just
as
i
d
hop
but
one
unhappy
side
effect
be
that
our
product
line
become
wildly
disorganize
by
september
we
have
eight
computer
in
our
sale
catalog
plus
a
number
of
old
vacuum
tube
machine
the
internal
architecture
of
each
of
these
computer
be
quite
different
so
different
software
and
different
peripheral
equipment
such
as
printer
and
disk
drive
have
to
be
use
with
each
machine
if
a
customer
s
business
grow
and
he
want
to
shift
from
a
small
computer
to
a
large
one
he
have
to
get
all
new
everything
and
rewrite
all
his
program
often
at
great
expense
the
man
whose
job
it
be
to
spur
ibm
s
growth
rate
be
vin
learson
who
at
this
point
be

group
executive
in
charge
of
our
manufacturing
and
development
division
he
thought
the
obvious
answer
be
to
simplify
the
product
line
and
he
ask
the
technical
people
to
try
but
at
first
this
request
have
very
little
effect
because
the
engineer
of
each
division
be
wed
to
their
own
machine
the
amaze
thing
about
vin
apart
from
the
tremendous
force
of
his
personality
be
his
cleverness
as
a
manager
he
saw
that
it
be
time
to
break
down
the
rivalry
between
the
two
division
and
he
do
it
by
apply
a
management
technique
call
abrasive
interaction
this
meant
force
people
to
swap
side
take
the
top
engineer
from
the
small
computer
division
and
make
him
bos
of
the
best
development
team
in
the
large
computer
division
a
lot
of
people
thought
this
make
about
as
much
sense
as
elect
khrushchev
president
but
after
interact
abrasively
for
some
month
those
engineer
earn
one
another
s
respect
just
as
vin
anticipate
slowly
they
work
their
way
around
to
the
idea
of
building
a
single
computer
line
that
would
span
the
entire
market
vin
make
this
group
of
engineer
the
core
of
a
much
large
committee
call
spread
an
acronym
for
system
program
research
engineering
and
development
whose
charter
be
to
map
out
a
new
product
strategy
the
spread
committee
met
for
a
couple
of
month
late
in
and
when
it
be
slow
produce
a
report
vin
get
impatient
two
week
before
christmas
he
sent
them
to
a
motel
in
connecticut
with
order
not
to
come
back
until
they
d
agree
that
be
how
the
plan
for
system
be
born
in
the
form
of
an
eighty
page
report
deliver
on
december
during
the
year
of
the
spread
report
i
be
busy
on
presidential
committee
in
washington
and
follow
the
technical
debate
within
the
computer
division
only
from
a
distance
but
by
the
middle
of
enough
have
go
wrong
that
i
be
spending
a
lot
more
time
at
the
office
the
stock
market
that
may
have
its
big
drop
since
and
ibm
stock
get
hammer
along
with
the
rest
lose
about
one
third
of
its
value
its
first
major
decline
in
thirty
year
that
alone
would
have
be
enough
to
reel
me
in
and
with
the
on
the
way
i
begin
to
get
a
hollow
feel
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
about
the
risk
we
face
ibm
have
always
succeed
by
make
bold
move
but
the
system
plan
be
dramatic
even
by
our
standard
vin
be
the
father
of
the
new
line
of
machine
his
intention
be
to
make
all
other
computer
obsolete
include
the
thousand
of
machine
on
which
we
be
then
collect
rent
and
to
replace
them
with
a
completely
new
family
of
processor
range
from
little
machine
rent
for
per
month
to
high
performance
giant
rent
for
more
than
per
month
the
machine
would
all
embody
a
revolutionary
new
feature
call
compatibility
which
meant
that
despite
their
great
variation
in
size
they
d
be
able
to
use
the
same
software
and
hook
up
to
the
same
disk
drive
printer
and
other
peripheral
once
customer
shift
to
system
they
d
be
able
to
expand
their
installation
simply
by
mix
and
match
component
from
our
sale
catalog
that
be
good
for
them
and
the
benefit
for
ibm
be
equally
compelling
once
a
customer
enter
the
circle
of
user
we
knew
we
could
keep
him
there
for
a
very
long
time
from
the
begin
we
face
two
risk
either
of
which
alone
be
enough
to
keep
us
awake
night
first
there
be
the
task
of
coordinate
the
hardware
and
software
design
work
for
the
new
line
we
have
engineering
team
all
over
america
and
europe
work
simultaneously
on
six
new
processor
and
dozen
of
new
peripheral
disk
drive
tape
drive
printer
magnetic
and
optical
character
reader
communication
equipment
and
terminal
but
in
the
end
all
this
hardware
would
have
to
plug
together
the
software
be
a
big
hurdle
still
in
order
for
system
to
have
a
consistent
personality
hundred
of
programmer
have
to
write
million
of
line
of
computer
code
nobody
have
ever
tackle
that
complex
a
program
job
and
the
engineer
be
under
great
pressure
to
get
it
do
our
other
source
of
worry
be
that
we
be
try
for
the
first
time
to
manufacture
our
own
electronic
part
the
electronics
industry
after
have
progress
very
fast
during
the
s
from
the
vacuum
tube
to
the
transistor
be
on
the
verge
of
another
transformation
the
wave
of
the
future
be
integrate
circuit
computer
chip
that
incorporate
transistor
resistor
diode
and
so
on
all
in
a
single
tiny
unit
nobody
be
use
integrate
circuit
in
computer
yet
but
the
system
design
call
for
a
lot
of
them
al
williams
argue
that
even
though
we
d
rely
on
supplier
to
provide
the
earlier
generation
of
component
we
have
to
manufacture
these
ourselves
whole
computer
be
go
to
shrink
down
onto
these
device
he
say
when
that
happens
do
you
think
we
ll
want
to
be
buying
them
from
outsider
if
we
re
go
to
stay
in
the
computer
business
we
d
well
learn
how
to
make
these
thing
ourselves
i
agree
but
i
ll
never
forget
how
expensive
it
be
to
build
our
first
integrate
circuit
factory
ordinary
plant
in
those
day
cost
about
forty
dollar
per
square
foot
in
the
integrate
circuit
plant
which
have
to
be
kept
dust
free
and
look
more
like
a
surgical
ward
than
a
factory
floor
the
cost
be
over
one
hundred
fifty
dollar
i
could
hardly
believe
the
bill
that
be
come
through
and
i
wasn
t
the
only
one
who
be
shock
the
board
give
me
a
terrible
time
about
the
cost
be
you
really
sure
you
need
all
this
they
d
say
have
you
gotten
competitive
bid
we
don
t
want
these
factory
to
be
luxurious
our
original
intent
be
to
announce
the
first
machine
in
april
and
gradually
phase
out
the
old
product
line
by
unveil
the
rest
over
eighteen
month
unfortunately
we
d
miscalculate
how
much
time
we
have
and
the
flaw
in
our
exist
product
line
caught
up
with
us
a
year
or
two
sooner
than
we
d
anticipate
by
spring
the
old
computer
be
obsolete
we
do
a
technical
study
show
that
while
the
s
be
go
to
be
well
than
the
late
computer
from
rca
burroughs
honeywell
univac
and
general
electric
all
those
competitive
machine
be
superior
to
our
exist
line
a
number
of
them
offer
two
to
three
time
the
performance
of
our
computer
for
the
same
price
our
salesman
be
hamstrung
since
system
have
not
yet
be
announce
and
none
of
them
even
knew
what
we
be
planning
they
have
nothing
to
tell
customer
by
the
middle
of
sale
office
be
send
in
panicky
report
that
they
could
no
longer
hold
the
line
against
the
competition
even
though
demand
for
computer
increase
by
well
over
percent
that
year
ibm
grow
only
seven
percent
our
low
growth
since
the
war
the
only
solution
be
to
get
system
out
the
door
fast
and
a
number
of
executive
argue
that
we
ought
to
launch
the
whole
thing
at
once
this
would
surely
make
a
tremendous
splash
in
the
market
customer
would
see
how
they
d
be
able
to
grow
with
the
product
line
so
we
could
persuade
them
to
wait
for
the
s
to
be
produce
instead
of
jumping
to
competitor
but
there
be
big
disadvantage
for
one
thing
although
the
new
computer
be
nearly
ready
not
all
of
them
have
go
through
the
rigorous
test
we
require
a
big
danger
be
that
once
we
start
accept
order
our
factory
network
would
be
under
tremendous
strain
to
deliver
every
item
in
an
enormously
complicate
new
product
line
there
wasn
t
go
to
be
much
room
for
error
it
be
the
big
riskiest
decision
i
ever
make
and
i
agonize
about
it
for
week
but
deep
down
i
believe
there
be
nothing
ibm
couldn
t
do
and
so
on
april
almost
exactly
fifty
year
after
my
father
first
come
to
work
at
ibm
we
stag
a
product
announcement
that
would
have
make
him
proud
to
attract
maximum
publicity
we
held
press
conference
in
sixty
three
u
s
city
and
fourteen
foreign
country
while
ten
of
thousand
of
guest
all
over
the
world
show
up
for
customer
briefing
a
charter
train
carry
two
hundred
reporter
in
new
york
from
grand
central
terminal
to
poughkeepsie
where
the
main
announcement
be
make
i
present
the
as
the
most
important
product
announcement
in
company
history
and
the
visitor
be
show
into
a
large
display
hall
where
six
new
computer
and
forty
four
new
peripheral
stretch
before
their
eye
within
ibm
there
be
a
great
feel
of
celebration
because
a
new
era
be
opening
up
but
when
i
look
at
those
new
product
i
didn
t
feel
as
confident
as
i
d
have
like
not
all
of
the
equipment
on
display
be
real
some
unit
be
just
mockups
make
of
wood
we
explain
this
to
our
guest
so
there
be
no
deception
but
it
be
a
dangerous
cut
of
corner
not
the
way
i
think
business
ought
to
be
do
and
an
uncomfortable
reminder
to
me
of
how
far
we
have
to
go
before
we
could
call
the
program
a
success
williams
and
i
felt
that
the
announcement
be
the
appropriate
moment
to
bring
dick
into
the
ibm
mainstream
until
then
vin
have
be
in
sole
command
of
the
project
now
we
set
dick
up
as
his
peer
and
divide
responsibility
between
them
dick
be
in
charge
of
the
engineering
and
manufacturing
side
of
the
business
and
vin
be
in
charge
of
the
sale
force
in
hindsight
i
think
vin
deeply
resent
this
change
and
with
reason
the
be
his
product
line
and
here
we
be
tell
him
to
go
out
and
sell
it
while
we
brought
my
brother
in
to
finish
vin
s
job
but
to
al
and
me
at
the
time
it
seem
natural
to
divide
responsibility
between
the
two
men
although
dick
have
never
launch
a
major
product
he
have
preside
over
world
trade
s
complicate
factory
system
in
europe
and
we
need
vin
with
his
enormous
drive
and
year
of
sell
experience
out
there
twist
the
tail
of
our
salesman
once
the
assignment
be
make
williams
and
i
felt
so
satisfied
with
ibm
s
course
that
we
announce
we
would
step
back
from
the
day
to
day
operation
of
the
company
we
set
up
something
call
the
corporate
operation
board
with
vin
and
dick
as
co
chairman
and
make
it
their
responsibility
to
run
the
show
i
honestly
thought
i
d
give
vin
the
tougher
job
the
engineering
and
manufacturing
side
of
the
company
have
tremendous
momentum
on
this
project
by
then
while
the
sale
force
be
start
from
scratch
not
only
do
they
have
to
turn
the
tide
against
our
competition
but
there
be
danger
that
the
would
alienate
a
lot
of
customer
those
use
to
their
current
machine
be
almost
sure
to
balk
at
the
idea
of
rewrite
their
software
to
work
with
the
new
line
vin
s
people
have
to
convince
customer
to
make
those
conversion
while
competitor
salesman
flock
around
say
don
t
convert
come
to
us
convert
to
us
i
be
so
afraid
of
lose
customer
that
i
call
dick
and
vin
into
my
office
and
lecture
them
sternly
i
told
vin
if
the
sale
force
need
new
feature
or
extra
software
to
move
those
machine
i
want
you
to
shout
loud
and
clear
and
we
will
produce
them
for
you
i
told
dick
be
responsive
to
the
sale
side
of
the
business
but
my
anxiety
be
misplace
we
get
immense
number
of
order
far
more
than
expect
and
even
more
kept
pour
in
everybody
felt
euphoric
at
first
but
then
the
program
seem
to
get
more
complicate
every
month
competitor
found
gap
in
the
new
line
and
start
win
away
influential
customer
so
we
have
to
add
two
new
computer
to
the
six
we
d
already
unveiled
we
announce
an
ultra
fast
scientific
machine
to
fight
off
control
data
and
a
small
special
purpose
processor
to
fight
off
general
electric
each
new
machine
require
a
major
diversion
of
engineering
talent
meanwhile
the
effort
to
write
basic
software
for
the
line
bogged
down
alarmingly
the
more
the
software
be
delayed
the
more
programmer
we
assign
by
we
have
two
thousand
people
work
on
it
and
the
cost
of
develop
the
software
be
begin
to
exceed
the
cost
of
the
hardware
we
learn
the
hard
way
one
of
the
great
secret
of
computer
engineering
throw
people
at
a
software
project
be
not
the
way
to
speed
it
up
a
piece
of
software
be
a
unified
thing
if
you
try
to
break
up
the
job
of
write
it
among
too
many
people
it
take
more
time
to
coordinate
them
than
the
division
of
labor
save
or
as
fred
brook
the
droll
engineering
genius
from
north
carolina
who
lead
the
project
once
write
the
bearing
of
a
child
take
nine
month
no
matter
how
many
woman
be
assign
there
be
no
way
to
hide
our
struggle
from
customer
who
be
order
the
machine
so
i
spoke
to
a
conference
of
ibm
user
about
it
a
few
month
ago
ibm
s
software
budget
for
be
go
to
be
forty
million
dollar
i
ask
vin
learson
last
night
before
i
left
what
he
thought
it
would
be
and
he
say
fifty
million
this
afternoon
i
met
watt
humphrey
who
be
in
charge
of
program
production
in
the
hall
here
and
say
be
this
figure
about
right
can
i
use
it
he
say
it
s
go
to
be
sixty
million
you
can
see
that
if
i
keep
ask
question
we
won
t
pay
a
dividend
this
year
i
be
only
half
joking
by
the
time
the
software
be
finally
deliver
year
late
we
d
sunk
a
half
billion
dollar
into
it
alone
make
it
the
single
large
cost
in
the
system
program
and
the
single
large
expenditure
in
company
history
six
month
after
the
announcement
the
complication
of
the
project
be
alarm
enough
that
i
begin
hold
monday
morning
meeting
in
my
office
just
as
in
the
day
of
the
defense
calculator
i
disband
vin
and
dick
s
corporate
operation
board
and
replace
it
with
a
new
management
review
committee
compose
of
five
men
al
my
brother
me
vin
and
dick
bullen
our
organizational
expert
who
by
now
be
a
vice
president
and
group
executive
we
make
shift
like
that
all
the
time
at
the
top
of
ibm
but
this
one
didn
t
sit
well
with
my
brother
or
vin
they
knew
that
i
have
give
them
the
business
to
run
and
now
i
be
take
back
the
rein
every
monday
we
d
get
together
and
there
would
be
serious
problem
on
the
table
it
be
not
a
happy
group
vin
and
dick
weren
t
get
along
and
there
be
also
tension
between
dick
and
me
for
the
first
time
in
our
life
he
be
reporting
to
me
on
a
day
to
day
basis
and
those
meeting
of
the
management
review
committee
be
fierce
that
committee
which
have
exist
in
various
incarnation
since
just
before
the
williamsburg
conference
in
have
always
be
where
i
evaluate
top
executive
and
determine
whether
they
be
pull
their
weight
since
the
success
of
the
corporation
be
directly
related
to
how
this
group
perform
i
judged
them
harshly
and
it
be
easy
to
find
a
man
want
even
if
his
performance
in
low
job
have
be
superior
it
be
the
crucible
i
go
after
my
brother
in
the
same
way
i
d
have
go
after
anybody
else
in
that
position
i
remember
one
episode
at
the
world
s
fair
dick
and
i
go
out
to
the
flush
meadow
fairground
to
look
over
the
ibm
pavilion
which
have
be
design
by
eero
saarinen
just
before
his
death
the
building
be
dominate
by
an
elevate
theater
shape
like
a
giant
egg
with
ibm
imprint
in
ba
relief
all
over
it
dick
and
i
be
tour
this
exhibit
with
some
associate
when
the
subject
of
computer
circuit
come
up
i
d
be
hearing
about
a
new
machine
recently
unveiled
by
a
competitor
that
incorporate
an
electronic
chip
make
of
silicon
call
a
monolithic
integrate
circuit
such
chip
be
as
common
as
table
salt
today
but
i
d
never
heard
of
them
and
our
competitor
be
claim
they
be
far
superior
to
the
ceramic
and
metal
integrate
circuit
in
system
machine
technology
be
dick
s
area
so
i
ask
him
about
it
and
he
be
totally
mystify
what
be
monolithics
he
say
i
castigate
him
for
that
loudly
tell
him
he
d
well
make
sure
the
wasn
t
go
to
be
obsolete
before
it
be
even
deliver
we
later
found
that
our
scientist
have
be
work
on
monolithics
for
year
so
there
be
no
real
danger
such
incident
drove
dick
and
me
apart
now
i
begin
to
worry
about
al
s
impend
retirement
his
fifty
fifth
birthday
be
less
than
two
year
away
and
he
seem
more
serious
than
ever
about
leave
i
told
him
i
didn
t
think
ibm
could
spare
him
and
i
try
everything
i
could
think
of
to
make
him
to
change
his
mind
i
even
offer
to
step
aside
and
let
him
run
the
company
tell
him
he
have
do
so
much
to
build
ibm
that
i
would
be
proud
to
serve
under
him
for
the
rest
of
my
career
al
knew
i
really
meant
it
if
he
d
agree
i
d
have
announce
that
i
be
turn
over
the
helm
to
al
williams
who
be
go
to
be
chief
executive
and
president
and
that
i
be
go
to
stay
on
as
chairman
but
al
didn
t
want
the
job
by
some
miracle
hundred
of
medium
size
s
be
deliver
on
time
in
but
that
give
me
no
comfort
because
behind
the
scene
i
could
see
we
be
lose
ground
the
quality
and
performance
of
the
early
computer
be
below
the
standard
we
d
set
and
we
d
actually
be
skip
some
of
the
most
rigorous
test
for
month
we
have
the
chief
test
engineer
come
to
the
monday
morning
meeting
i
d
ask
how
be
those
machine
perform
and
he
d
say
they
re
not
make
it
he
d
set
up
his
chart
and
show
where
we
be
go
wrong
production
kept
get
held
up
by
shortage
at
one
point
we
ran
out
of
little
copper
electrical
contact
without
which
our
mighty
computer
couldn
t
function
our
usual
supplier
just
couldn
t
keep
up
with
our
factory
we
solve
that
through
old
fashion
ibm
heroic
engineer
fly
around
the
country
to
all
the
supplier
they
could
find
scoop
up
copper
contact
and
rush
them
back
to
ibm
to
make
matter
bad
we
be
deliver
the
new
machine
without
the
crucial
software
customer
be
force
to
use
temporary
program
much
more
rudimentary
than
what
we
d
promise
which
meant
that
they
couldn
t
get
the
full
benefit
of
their
new
machine
yet
customer
be
still
order
s
faster
than
we
could
build
them
with
billion
of
dollar
of
machine
already
in
our
backlog
we
be
tell
people
that
they
d
have
to
wait
two
or
three
year
for
computer
they
need
a
lot
of
customer
be
unhappy
about
that
and
i
be
worried
that
the
slightest
additional
delay
in
shipment
would
drive
them
into
our
competitor
arm
meanwhile
the
friction
between
dick
and
vin
get
completely
out
of
hand
their
job
be
suppose
to
be
complementary
but
instead
of
support
each
other
they
be
run
a
race
vin
do
a
superb
job
at
rally
the
sale
force
and
convincing
customer
to
make
the
transition
to
the
but
he
be
constantly
ask
my
brother
for
change
and
enhancement
in
the
machine
to
make
them
sell
well
still
he
d
say
if
we
can
t
have
this
feature
it
ll
be
very
difficult
to
sell
to
the
aircraft
industry
and
if
we
can
t
have
that
feature
it
ll
be
very
difficult
to
sell
to
department
store
i
d
told
him
to
do
that
of
course
but
if
there
hadn
t
be
this
feel
of
rivalry
and
resentment
i
doubt
he
would
have
push
so
hard
vin
be
an
experienced
production
man
and
could
see
that
the
engineering
staff
be
badly
overload
dick
for
his
part
have
a
go
for
broke
attitude
he
say
yes
too
many
time
when
he
should
have
told
vin
i
be
freeze
the
production
specification
now
you
ll
just
have
to
sell
the
machine
the
way
we
build
them
dick
would
instead
just
turn
around
and
put
even
more
pressure
on
the
engineer
that
autumn
everything
look
black
black
black
everybody
be
pessimistic
about
the
program
we
be
cling
to
our
production
schedule
but
morale
be
go
down
some
section
of
our
factory
have
be
work
sixty
hour
week
for
six
month
and
the
employee
be
worn
out
the
stress
on
technician
in
the
field
be
steadily
increase
as
they
try
to
install
more
and
more
of
the
new
machine
the
engineer
be
in
the
bad
shape
of
all
i
remember
go
up
to
poughkeepsie
to
check
on
the
software
problem
we
have
a
huge
building
fill
with
programmer
and
their
manager
be
a
fellow
name
tom
gavis
he
d
never
be
to
college
but
he
really
knew
program
i
go
to
his
office
and
found
him
sit
at
a
desk
with
a
rumple
cot
next
to
it
where
he
slept
i
say
why
can
t
you
get
this
program
out
faster
he
didn
t
give
a
damn
that
i
be
chairman
he
snarl
well
if
you
d
get
the
hell
out
of
here
and
leave
us
alone
we
would
i
make
a
hasty
retreat
dick
wasn
t
do
too
well
under
such
tremendous
pressure
another
of
his
problem
in
addition
to
vin
be
dick
s
own
subordinate
who
be
not
serve
him
well
his
top
lieutenant
be
an
imperturbable
fellow
who
never
fail
to
irritate
me
we
talk
pretty
forcefully
at
those
monday
morning
meeting
but
this
guy
would
come
in
week
after
week
and
report
horrible
production
problem
in
a
monotone
sometimes
i
d
lose
patience
and
explode
at
him
and
when
dick
intervene
to
protect
his
man
i
d
explode
at
dick
too
in
mid
october
dick
told
us
that
a
metallurgical
problem
at
our
new
integrate
circuit
factory
be
go
to
cut
production
in
half
for
the
immediate
future
the
consequence
be
what
we
d
all
fear
we
be
go
to
have
to
delay
our
computer
shipment
how
far
be
we
go
to
miss
these
delivery
i
ask
dick
it
wasn
t
a
week
or
two
week
it
be
three
month
i
panicked
never
in
its
history
have
ibm
miss
a
shipment
date
by
that
far
and
with
so
much
rid
on
system
we
couldn
t
afford
to
now
when
i
realize
i
have
no
confidence
that
there
wouldn
t
be
far
delay
my
think
become
very
self
protective
i
be
fifty
one
year
old
i
have
nine
year
of
fantastic
success
behind
me
and
i
didn
t
want
my
career
to
be
wreck
by
an
announcement
that
the
whole
new
product
line
be
never
go
to
fly
at
all
under
these
circumstance
spar
my
brother
s
feeling
be
the
last
thing
on
my
mind
we
mobilize
the
best
people
we
have
and
order
them
to
find
out
what
be
wrong
on
the
manufacturing
side
of
the
house
al
and
i
team
up
red
lamotte
have
retire
but
we
ask
him
to
come
back
in
and
give
us
his
perspective
those
be
terrible
day
because
the
more
we
dug
into
it
the
bad
the
situation
look
which
be
always
what
happens
in
a
crisis
al
whose
usual
role
be
to
counsel
restraint
and
put
problem
into
perspective
saw
no
reason
for
calm
this
time
he
be
frantic
about
ibm
s
finance
we
have
always
be
a
tower
of
financial
stability
and
we
have
figure
the
delay
wouldn
t
have
much
impact
on
our
revenue
at
least
in
the
short
run
because
we
be
cushion
by
our
enormous
rental
income
but
williams
be
nervous
about
something
else
it
be
time
to
think
about
closing
the
book
for
and
he
didn
t
know
where
all
the
money
be
the
particular
headache
be
a
balance
sheet
item
call
work
in
process
inventory
this
figure
be
suppose
to
represent
the
million
of
part
and
thousand
of
machine
currently
under
production
in
our
factory
what
we
didn
t
realize
be
that
our
accounting
system
be
an
anachronism
left
over
from
the
day
when
ibm
have
just
a
few
plant
and
each
be
responsible
for
its
own
set
of
product
with
the
the
plant
have
become
interdependent
about
two
third
of
all
our
factory
shipment
be
unfinished
good
that
go
on
to
other
factory
for
more
work
we
have
no
system
for
keep
tab
on
this
inventory
move
around
the
company
al
guess
that
the
amount
in
question
might
be
million
but
the
data
he
be
get
be
so
vague
as
to
be
useless
the
man
he
assign
to
the
problem
be
john
opel
at
that
point
a
fast
rise
young
executive
in
the
data
product
division
find
out
what
the
damn
inventory
be
williams
told
him
opel
knew
about
manufacturing
and
have
a
reputation
as
a
brilliant
analyst
he
poll
all
the
plant
but
he
couldn
t
get
the
number
to
add
up
either
he
d
give
an
estimate
to
al
only
to
find
out
within
twenty
four
hour
that
he
d
not
only
miss
but
miss
by
fifty
million
dollar
opel
finally
get
so
frustrate
that
he
insist
that
each
factory
manager
take
a
physical
inventory
which
mean
clerk
with
clipboard
walk
through
the
factory
counting
thing
we
d
never
have
to
do
that
before
but
that
be
how
opel
finally
discover
that
the
accounting
system
have
go
completely
out
of
whack
we
have
almost
six
hundred
million
dollar
of
work
in
process
inventory
and
none
of
the
factory
manager
want
to
claim
it
they
be
squabble
with
opel
about
who
be
responsible
for
what
this
state
of
affair
make
al
frantic
because
understate
the
inventory
make
it
seem
as
though
ibm
have
more
cash
on
hand
than
we
actually
have
in
reality
the
have
soak
up
all
our
fund
in
another
few
week
we
d
have
need
emergency
loan
to
meet
the
payroll
here
be
al
ready
to
retire
after
a
long
and
distinguish
career
and
in
the
whole
history
of
ibm
we
d
never
have
a
problem
like
that
ibm
have
always
be
swim
in
cash
from
the
enormous
flow
of
rental
payment
we
didn
t
tell
the
public
about
our
cash
shortage
but
it
be
the
big
reason
we
unexpectedly
sell
another
million
of
stock
that
spring
dick
and
i
be
hardly
talk
at
all
the
more
problem
we
turn
up
the
quieter
he
become
just
as
he
have
in
the
old
day
when
dad
and
i
argue
by
now
i
knew
that
my
plan
for
bring
him
into
the
domestic
company
have
be
a
horrible
blunder
bad
for
dick
s
career
and
for
our
personal
relationship
i
thought
i
be
give
dick
an
opportunity
in
an
area
where
he
would
be
an
outstanding
success
instead
i
have
hand
him
a
stack
deck
he
couldn
t
hold
his
own
against
the
demand
put
on
him
by
learson
dick
knew
how
to
rally
the
engineer
when
they
be
almost
too
exhaust
to
go
on
but
he
have
little
experience
in
run
a
rapidly
change
engineering
and
development
operation
and
it
be
hard
for
him
to
manage
the
day
to
day
particular
of
the
business
i
would
have
have
the
same
problem
except
that
i
d
always
surround
myself
with
competent
detail
men
the
people
work
for
dick
weren
t
serve
him
well
everybody
be
scar
al
and
i
agree
that
if
the
program
be
ever
to
get
off
the
ground
we
have
to
put
it
under
a
single
manager
a
dictator
and
we
knew
it
have
to
be
learson
over
the
year
vin
have
proven
again
and
again
that
he
knew
how
to
take
hold
of
a
troubled
project
and
bring
it
off
i
agonize
about
the
effect
this
would
have
on
my
brother
i
call
dick
into
my
office
on
a
gray
december
afternoon
i
ve
get
to
tell
you
some
thing
that
be
not
very
pleasant
i
say
the
future
of
the
business
depends
on
this
it
look
bad
now
and
i
m
go
to
have
to
take
the
whole
project
and
put
it
under
the
person
i
believe
be
most
competent
to
bring
it
out
of
the
wood
i
told
him
it
be
go
to
be
vin
and
that
dick
would
shift
over
to
be
chief
of
the
corporate
staff
with
no
line
management
responsibility
he
be
absolutely
furious
in
other
word
he
say
control
of
this
entire
business
go
to
him
and
i
m
left
with
some
crumb
in
the
follow
month
we
begin
to
feel
our
way
out
of
the
manufacturing
crisis
the
machine
weren
t
very
good
at
the
outset
but
our
service
people
kept
them
run
in
the
field
and
the
more
computer
we
built
the
high
the
quality
become
then
the
long
delayed
software
finally
begin
to
come
and
suddenly
the
rise
be
blossoming
at
the
end
of
we
have
over
four
billion
dollar
in
revenue
something
like
seven
or
eight
thousand
system
instal
and
a
billion
dollar
in
pre
tax
profit
the
board
of
director
elect
vin
learson
president
of
ibm
on
january
al
williams
take
the
first
step
into
early
retirement
move
up
to
head
the
board
s
executive
committee
we
make
dick
vice
chairman
and
he
remain
chairman
of
world
trade
and
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
but
for
month
afterward
he
come
to
the
office
only
sporadically
and
kept
to
himself
his
confidence
seem
shaken
i
felt
nothing
but
shame
and
frustration
at
the
way
i
d
treat
him
there
be
so
many
other
way
to
have
manage
thing
perhaps
the
wise
course
would
have
be
to
leave
dick
in
world
trade
he
would
have
be
know
as
the
great
ibm
internationalist
and
that
i
think
would
have
be
equal
in
honor
to
serve
as
chief
executive
for
five
or
ten
year
as
it
be
we
remade
the
computer
industry
with
the
system
and
objectively
it
be
the
great
triumph
of
my
business
career
but
whenever
i
look
back
on
it
i
think
about
the
brother
i
injured
and
the
dream
of
my
father
s
that
i
could
never
make
come
right
a
little
later
that
winter
my
mother
die
she
be
eighty
two
and
have
be
ill
for
month
so
we
have
a
chance
to
get
ready
for
her
death
it
be
very
hard
on
dick
as
her
young
child
he
have
be
closest
to
her
and
her
death
come
only
a
few
week
after
his
responsibility
for
manufacturing
and
engineering
at
ibm
be
take
away
i
mourn
her
by
retreat
with
olive
to
colorado
where
i
hand
write
acknowledgment
to
literally
hundred
of
condolence
from
people
inside
and
outside
ibm
all
over
the
world
we
stayed
for
almost
two
week
which
wasn
t
nearly
enough
time
but
i
couldn
t
get
away
from
work
for
any
longer
while
our
management
crisis
have
be
resolve
we
still
have
to
make
good
on
our
commitment
to
deliver
billion
of
dollar
of
new
computer
the
urgency
of
my
work
be
as
great
as
always
the
difference
now
be
that
the
joy
i
d
felt
in
run
the
company
have
disappear
with
mother
go
dick
on
the
sideline
and
al
williams
work
a
reduce
schedule
in
preparation
for
his
retirement
i
found
myself
more
isolated
than
i
ever
imagine
possible
by
promote
learson
i
d
kick
myself
upstairs
i
be
still
chief
executive
of
course
but
i
be
out
of
the
day
to
day
operation
of
the
business
all
the
other
key
executive
line
and
staff
men
alike
report
to
vin
there
be
no
question
that
he
deserve
this
job
the
team
he
d
assemble
for
the
system
project
people
like
bob
evans
fred
brook
and
gene
amdahl
may
have
be
the
best
collection
of
engineering
management
talent
in
ibm
history
in
spite
of
his
toughness
as
a
bos
vin
have
won
their
loyalty
and
respect
he
call
them
the
boy
and
with
the
future
of
the
company
rid
on
the
new
computer
they
get
the
job
do
it
take
me
a
long
time
to
reconcile
myself
to
have
him
as
my
number
two
however
i
resent
the
rough
way
he
have
treat
my
brother
but
even
in
the
best
of
circumstance
the
difference
in
our
temperament
would
have
make
it
hard
for
vin
and
me
to
build
a
trust
relationship
like
the
one
i
have
with
al
williams
al
and
i
talk
about
everything
together
from
corporate
strategy
to
child
rear
we
d
make
many
of
ibm
s
important
decision
in
relaxed
discussion
with
our
foot
up
on
the
coffee
table
in
contrast
vin
work
best
by
himself
and
despite
his
great
intelligence
decisiveness
and
drive
he
be
not
at
all
contemplative
or
methodical
like
al
he
ducked
meeting
whenever
he
could
put
very
little
store
in
staff
work
and
favor
executive
like
john
opel
who
knew
how
to
take
shortcut
across
organizational
line
i
d
work
with
vin
for
fifteen
year
and
he
have
hat
office
procedure
from
the
very
begin
back
in
the
early
s
when
al
be
treasurer
and
vin
be
general
sale
manager
al
have
learn
this
the
hard
way
in
those
day
vin
be
big
on
a
kind
of
memo
that
al
call
floopers
because
of
the
way
they
d
float
over
the
transom
and
onto
al
s
desk
without
his
really
notice
by
send
floopers
vin
could
always
claim
to
have
inform
al
of
whatever
it
be
he
be
go
to
do
then
if
al
challenged
him
he
d
say
you
knew
all
about
that
i
told
you
in
a
memo
on
the
twenty
eighth
of
october
i
never
get
such
a
memo
al
would
say
but
he
d
look
in
the
pile
on
his
desk
and
sure
enough
there
it
would
be
after
dad
held
al
responsible
for
several
of
vin
s
expenditure
that
al
hadn
t
approve
al
finally
told
vin
he
d
disavow
any
memo
he
sent
that
he
hadn
t
read
and
put
his
initial
on
while
al
and
i
have
be
in
and
out
of
each
other
s
office
constantly
vin
and
i
usually
met
only
at
session
of
the
management
review
committee
four
or
five
time
each
month
each
meeting
be
a
tightly
schedule
series
of
presentation
by
line
executive
and
staff
expert
budget
pricing
decision
product
strategy
and
personnel
policy
all
pass
before
us
for
review
it
be
a
textbook
example
of
the
precision
management
style
for
which
ibm
be
famous
yet
i
ran
those
meeting
in
a
way
that
would
have
surprised
most
business
school
professor
because
it
be
anything
but
scientific
i
use
the
committee
to
probe
the
business
and
to
stir
thing
up
much
as
dad
use
to
do
by
buzzing
people
into
his
office
and
arbitrarily
assign
task
for
example
if
there
be
a
story
in
the
newspaper
that
morning
about
a
physicist
at
bell
lab
win
the
nobel
prize
i
might
disrupt
the
agenda
and
demand
to
know
why
no
ibm
scientist
have
ever
won
as
dad
always
have
i
try
constantly
to
make
the
executive
aim
a
little
high
this
practice
have
work
fine
as
long
as
al
be
president
he
function
like
the
ideal
ground
controller
when
i
go
off
on
these
flight
if
i
be
head
in
the
wrong
direction
he
have
an
easy
comfortable
way
of
straighten
me
out
but
he
also
knew
how
to
follow
up
when
i
have
a
point
with
vin
as
president
however
the
atmosphere
in
the
committee
change
he
be
skeptical
and
impatient
less
inclined
to
take
a
broad
view
he
be
never
exactly
insubordinate
but
he
often
seem
to
think
i
be
second
guess
decision
he
have
already
make
or
waste
time
on
concern
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
run
ibm
vin
like
al
have
too
much
self
discipline
and
good
sense
to
enter
a
contest
he
couldn
t
win
so
he
never
challenged
me
directly
at
the
company
instead
he
fought
it
out
with
me
on
the
high
sea
my
hobby
be
ocean
race
and
the
year
i
make
him
president
vin
enter
the
newport
to
bermuda
race
where
i
d
be
compete
for
year
he
didn
t
have
much
deep
water
experience
but
he
be
a
good
sailor
expert
in
small
boat
tactic
i
told
him
jokingly
at
a
management
review
committee
meeting
that
he
d
well
not
win
if
he
expect
to
stay
at
ibm
but
vin
make
it
no
secret
that
he
intend
to
beat
me
and
everybody
else
he
bought
a
boat
call
a
cal
with
a
radical
new
design
and
enlist
its
architect
as
a
member
of
his
crew
he
study
the
history
of
the
race
and
found
a
navigator
who
have
be
on
a
win
boat
three
different
time
when
we
race
to
bermuda
that
june
my
palawan
place
twenty
fourth
on
correct
time
and
his
thunderbird
come
in
first
that
may
have
stung
me
more
than
i
realize
because
at
the
next
bermuda
race
two
year
later
i
inadvertently
provoke
a
blow
up
with
vin
by
then
yacht
like
his
have
become
quite
common
although
they
be
still
controversial
they
be
fast
and
their
owner
found
way
to
make
them
faster
each
year
but
there
be
a
whole
school
of
traditionalist
like
me
who
thought
the
new
design
be
risk
seaworthiness
and
safety
in
the
pursuit
of
speed
two
night
before
the
race
be
due
to
start
i
take
a
walk
along
the
dock
in
newport
with
olin
stephen
the
dean
of
american
yacht
designer
who
be
also
chairman
of
the
international
ocean
race
rule
committee
you
re
let
people
modify
their
boat
too
radically
i
told
him
there
be
a
cal
like
vin
s
sit
out
of
the
water
nearby
so
that
you
could
see
the
silhouette
of
its
unorthodox
keel
and
rudder
i
gesture
toward
it
look
at
that
boat
it
s
design
specifically
to
take
advantage
of
the
fine
print
in
the
rule
olin
who
be
a
very
mild
man
say
well
yes
that
s
a
clever
design
but
why
do
you
object
to
it
it
s
perfectly
seaworthy
because
if
we
keep
fiddle
with
these
rule
beater
i
say
they
be
go
to
evolve
until
finally
they
become
unseaworthy
and
somebody
be
go
to
get
hurt
what
i
didn
t
realize
be
that
the
particular
cal
i
d
picked
to
criticize
be
actually
learson
s
suddenly
i
heard
an
enrage
voice
shout
what
do
you
say
and
from
the
shadow
behind
the
hull
emerge
vin
look
nine
foot
tall
with
his
fist
clenched
my
boat
s
a
rule
beater
what
do
you
mean
by
that
oh
no
vin
i
say
i
didn
t
even
know
this
be
your
boat
i
ve
just
be
talk
to
olin
here
about
the
way
his
committee
be
permit
boat
to
move
more
and
more
in
unusual
direction
i
m
sort
of
a
conventionalist
hah
he
say
you
re
try
to
knock
me
off
and
you
have
no
right
to
do
that
the
next
day
i
go
to
vin
at
a
pre
race
meeting
and
told
him
he
d
completely
misunderstood
the
bit
of
conversation
he
d
overheard
he
ignore
me
and
walk
away
olin
stephen
try
to
tell
him
the
same
thing
and
also
get
ignore
the
spectacle
of
the
two
top
executive
of
ibm
feud
over
their
sailboat
must
have
be
titillate
for
people
who
like
gossip
i
wish
i
could
have
stop
it
but
we
both
have
our
pride
involve
and
be
both
overreact
we
race
and
thunderbird
beat
palawan
again
finish
thirteenth
in
the
fleet
against
palawan
s
twentieth
but
when
we
get
back
to
the
office
the
follow
week
vin
still
wasn
t
talk
i
heard
nothing
from
him
for
several
day
he
didn
t
even
return
my
phone
call
it
take
about
a
week
before
he
d
cool
off
enough
to
remember
we
be
run
a
big
business
and
somehow
the
chairman
and
president
have
to
communicate
i
don
t
think
he
ever
believe
my
explanation
even
with
olin
s
corroboration
but
finally
he
accepted
a
phone
call
from
me
and
agree
that
the
matter
ought
to
be
drop
if
there
have
be
any
more
episode
like
this
vin
and
i
might
have
part
company
but
ibm
do
fantastically
well
during
that
period
thanks
largely
to
his
skill
as
a
manager
and
his
success
with
system
after
the
doldrums
of
the
early
s
the
company
be
grow
again
by
nearly
percent
per
year
a
growth
rate
more
like
that
of
an
entrepreneurial
startup
company
and
absolutely
unprecedented
for
a
multi
billion
dollar
corporation
by
we
be
among
the
ten
large
industrial
company
in
america
and
two
year
later
the
market
value
of
our
stock
be
great
than
that
of
general
motor
i
be
proud
of
our
achievement
but
i
felt
as
if
i
d
see
it
all
before
great
success
huge
growth
frequent
reorganization
constant
hire
and
training
on
an
ever
increase
scale
the
tension
at
the
top
of
the
business
really
wore
on
me
and
while
my
life
be
more
frenetically
busy
than
ever
i
begin
to
find
it
impossible
to
tend
the
store
as
single
mindedly
as
i
do
right
after
dad
die
i
might
have
be
indispensable
to
ibm
but
the
work
wasn
t
as
fulfil
i
felt
for
the
first
time
that
my
life
be
go
out
of
control
i
d
always
be
able
to
find
the
right
answer
in
any
crisis
i
d
ever
face
and
i
d
come
to
believe
it
be
possible
to
achieve
a
truly
perfect
career
by
use
all
the
tool
at
my
disposal
money
power
prestige
i
knew
i
could
influence
event
to
a
great
degree
than
most
people
and
i
have
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
with
enough
effort
i
could
make
everything
turn
out
right
for
myself
my
family
and
ibm
the
complexity
i
now
ran
into
caught
me
completely
unawares
suddenly
nothing
be
simple
nothing
come
out
quite
right
i
wasn
t
the
only
ibm
executive
sort
out
personal
problem
in
the
aftermath
of
the
crisis
divorce
be
become
much
more
common
at
ibm
it
have
be
practically
unheard
of
among
our
senior
manager
in
dad
s
day
many
of
the
men
be
also
have
difficulty
with
their
teenager
try
in
vain
to
shield
the
kid
from
the
social
ferment
of
the
late
s
drug
cause
some
real
tragedy
one
executive
s
son
be
a
troubled
boy
who
read
that
lsd
enables
you
to
understand
yourself
he
figure
that
if
one
dose
be
good
two
or
three
must
be
well
so
he
take
way
too
much
and
destroyed
his
mind
there
be
nothing
his
father
could
do
the
boy
have
to
be
commit
to
an
institution
i
have
problem
with
my
own
teenager
though
not
nearly
as
grave
in
the
spring
of
one
of
my
daughter
announce
that
she
want
to
drop
out
of
boarding
school
for
a
couple
of
month
i
spent
a
day
each
week
run
ibm
from
the
back
seat
of
a
limousine
as
i
rode
up
to
new
england
try
to
persuade
her
to
stay
ultimately
i
be
successful
she
finally
graduate
and
go
on
to
college
but
even
as
i
be
pressure
this
child
part
of
me
understood
the
confusion
of
the
young
generation
i
d
have
such
a
hard
time
find
my
own
direction
as
a
young
man
that
i
felt
sympathy
for
kid
who
weren
t
conventional
achiever
i
decide
that
one
of
the
most
important
thing
a
college
can
do
be
give
such
people
a
chance
to
find
their
own
way
in
i
get
my
brother
and
sister
to
back
me
in
establish
an
unusual
fellowship
program
the
watson
fellowship
which
be
name
after
my
father
and
finance
with
money
from
my
parent
estate
be
really
a
reflection
of
the
kind
of
kid
i
d
be
and
an
expression
of
my
gratitude
at
not
be
write
off
by
my
father
or
the
administration
at
brown
each
year
the
program
pick
seventy
five
graduate
senior
from
small
liberal
art
college
around
the
country
instead
of
look
for
straight
a
scholar
we
ask
college
to
nominate
young
people
whose
character
interest
and
creative
potential
make
them
worth
take
a
chance
on
we
pay
their
way
abroad
for
a
year
with
very
few
string
attach
to
pursue
their
own
project
which
can
be
as
ambitious
as
they
want
that
first
year
for
example
we
have
a
watson
fellow
in
paris
do
painting
another
trace
cultural
vestige
of
the
legal
system
of
ancient
greece
and
another
study
the
impact
of
american
medical
aid
on
country
in
asia
and
south
america
the
choice
reflect
the
extraordinary
insight
and
imagination
of
robert
schulze
a
former
dean
at
brown
who
be
the
program
s
first
executive
director
i
felt
proud
that
we
d
come
up
with
a
creative
response
to
the
generation
gap
but
i
have
to
admit
that
this
program
be
very
modest
compare
with
the
vast
disaffection
of
million
of
young
people
in
the
s
there
be
sign
of
trouble
everywhere
on
tv
you
saw
college
kid
take
over
campus
and
call
for
revolution
these
protest
be
very
upset
it
seem
as
though
our
democratic
process
be
on
the
verge
of
break
down
but
they
also
make
me
stop
and
think
about
the
social
ill
that
cause
them
as
a
liberal
democrat
i
felt
a
duty
to
solve
such
problem
but
i
didn
t
know
how
i
kept
look
for
way
to
make
myself
relevant
on
a
much
wider
scale
and
for
a
while
even
toyed
with
the
idea
of
jumping
into
politics
at
various
time
the
kennedy
family
and
other
prominent
democrat
sound
me
out
on
run
for
office
eunice
and
sargent
shriver
come
to
visit
us
in
vermont
at
one
point
and
eunice
say
tom
you
know
us
all
and
you
re
a
natural
born
politician
i
ve
see
you
charm
people
and
you
can
be
tough
as
nail
why
not
get
involve
bobby
who
be
now
a
senator
from
new
york
try
to
convince
me
to
run
against
nelson
rockefeller
for
governor
in
and
the
follow
year
ted
kennedy
introduce
me
to
influential
new
england
democrat
as
a
possible
senatorial
candidate
but
each
time
such
an
opportunity
come
up
i
d
talk
it
over
with
olive
and
decide
to
hold
off
i
be
reluctant
to
leave
ibm
and
didn
t
think
i
have
the
fire
in
the
belly
you
need
to
go
out
and
win
vote
yet
if
bobby
kennedy
have
make
it
to
the
white
house
i
d
have
be
willing
to
put
my
career
at
stake
either
by
run
for
office
during
his
administration
or
serve
as
an
appointee
to
try
to
help
put
the
country
back
on
track
i
pledge
my
support
to
him
in
the
summer
of
even
though
the
possibility
of
his
become
president
seem
at
least
five
year
away
lyndon
johnson
be
still
firmly
in
command
and
no
one
expect
bobby
to
run
until
i
told
him
that
the
nation
be
not
make
the
kind
of
progress
i
have
hop
that
i
thought
he
would
make
the
best
president
and
that
i
want
to
back
him
in
any
way
i
could
i
m
sure
he
be
hearing
the
same
thing
from
a
lot
of
people
he
simply
say
it
mean
a
great
deal
to
me
to
hear
that
and
beyond
that
he
be
noncommittal
i
saw
a
lot
of
bobby
he
come
to
visit
each
winter
in
stowe
and
each
summer
in
north
haven
i
use
to
lend
him
the
palawan
for
a
week
each
year
and
he
and
his
friend
would
stay
at
north
haven
for
one
or
two
night
before
sail
off
every
bedroom
in
the
house
would
be
fill
and
it
be
always
an
excite
group
people
like
sander
vanocur
the
television
reporter
rowland
evans
the
columnist
and
john
glenn
to
me
it
seem
that
lyndon
johnson
s
animosity
be
the
best
thing
that
have
ever
happen
to
bobby
as
soon
as
it
have
become
obvious
that
johnson
didn
t
want
him
as
a
run
mate
in
bobby
have
begin
to
mature
at
a
rapid
rate
during
his
year
as
senator
he
become
a
great
force
much
great
than
he
d
have
be
as
vice
president
he
fascinate
me
though
he
be
not
always
an
easy
guy
to
be
around
and
could
be
terribly
abrupt
i
remember
take
a
walk
with
him
on
our
north
haven
farm
as
we
chat
it
begin
to
mist
a
little
bit
but
i
paid
no
attention
until
he
say
rather
brusquely
when
be
you
go
to
turn
around
what
do
you
mean
well
it
s
rain
we
wouldn
t
call
this
rain
i
call
it
rain
let
s
go
back
to
the
house
i
could
imagine
have
a
cozy
talk
with
jack
kennedy
but
never
bobby
he
be
terrific
with
little
kid
but
in
conversation
with
adult
he
be
always
serious
mind
more
conscious
than
most
people
of
his
duty
to
his
country
and
he
never
let
down
the
bar
i
don
t
think
he
be
very
comfortable
with
me
either
but
soon
after
he
become
a
senator
he
make
a
recommendation
that
have
a
far
reach
effect
on
ibm
we
be
at
my
ski
lodge
at
stowe
and
during
a
quiet
moment
bobby
say
you
ve
do
a
lot
for
the
kennedy
tom
be
there
anything
we
can
do
for
you
i
d
never
thought
about
it
but
intuitively
i
knew
what
to
say
bobby
s
team
at
the
justice
department
be
disband
and
he
have
brilliant
men
can
you
recommend
a
lawyer
who
might
be
willing
to
come
to
ibm
as
our
general
counsel
i
say
give
ibm
s
size
and
dominance
of
the
computer
business
i
felt
sure
we
would
eventually
face
more
antitrust
problem
there
be
only
two
people
you
d
want
to
consider
bobby
say
burke
marshall
and
nicholas
katzenbach
if
you
can
get
either
of
them
you
ll
do
very
well
katzenbach
have
succeed
bob
as
attorney
general
and
marshall
have
be
head
of
the
justice
department
s
civil
right
division
and
played
a
key
role
in
the
desegregation
of
school
in
the
south
i
go
to
washington
talk
to
both
men
and
both
end
up
join
ibm
marshall
right
away
and
katzenbach
a
few
year
later
after
work
for
johnson
as
attorney
general
and
as
undersecretary
of
state
as
a
senator
represent
new
york
bobby
be
interested
in
cultivate
the
business
community
that
be
a
hopeless
cause
but
i
dutifully
gather
up
all
the
moderate
i
could
find
and
held
dinner
and
lunch
for
him
in
new
york
these
occasion
never
work
particularly
well
because
bob
be
at
his
best
when
he
felt
sympathy
for
his
audience
and
when
it
come
to
businessmen
there
wasn
t
much
sympathy
on
either
side
the
only
time
i
ever
saw
him
attract
business
backing
be
in
when
he
decide
to
tackle
brooklyn
s
bedford
stuyvesant
ghetto
it
be
the
bad
slum
in
new
york
big
and
more
neglect
than
harlem
and
in
many
way
a
tougher
and
more
frighten
place
there
have
be
race
riot
in
the
watt
section
of
los
angeles
the
previous
summer
and
nobody
want
the
violence
to
spread
bobby
s
idea
be
to
have
a
committee
of
white
business
leader
work
in
partnership
with
a
black
community
board
provide
managerial
advice
and
access
to
capital
and
when
bobby
felt
passionately
about
something
people
rally
to
him
he
persuade
both
mayor
lindsay
and
senator
javits
to
pitch
in
and
then
recruit
a
bipartisan
team
of
top
businessmen
include
me
bill
paley
of
cbs
andrew
heiskell
of
time
inc
george
moore
the
chairman
of
first
national
city
bank
andr
meyer
a
senior
partner
at
lazard
fr
re
benno
schmidt
of
the
wall
street
firm
j
h
whitney
and
others
bobby
would
fly
up
from
washington
to
new
york
for
our
meeting
and
unlike
other
blue
ribbon
committee
this
one
work
the
white
and
black
group
put
together
a
combination
of
new
job
housing
renovation
and
social
service
that
give
bedford
stuyvesant
a
bit
of
new
life
it
be
a
modest
success
but
in
the
context
of
all
the
other
fail
effort
to
revive
ghetto
community
that
be
quite
a
remarkable
accomplishment
during
the
long
hot
summer
of
when
there
be
race
riot
in
dozen
of
city
bedford
stuyvesant
be
quiet
and
bobby
deserves
some
credit
for
that
ibm
make
the
big
contribution
of
all
to
the
effort
in
brooklyn
we
put
a
new
plant
there
people
in
the
late
s
have
begin
to
talk
in
term
of
corporate
social
responsibility
the
use
of
the
economic
power
of
big
business
to
right
some
of
the
country
s
wrong
and
there
be
no
question
in
my
mind
that
ibm
ought
to
extend
itself
no
one
expect
much
in
the
way
of
corporate
citizenship
from
a
company
that
make
only
a
few
million
dollar
a
year
but
when
you
make
hundred
of
million
you
ignore
public
opinion
at
your
own
peril
i
d
already
enlist
ibm
in
president
johnson
s
war
on
poverty
a
couple
of
year
earlier
through
a
subsidiary
we
be
run
a
major
job
corp
center
at
camp
rodman
an
abandon
army
base
in
new
bedford
massachusetts
the
idea
be
to
train
seven
hundred
fifty
hard
core
unemployed
each
year
black
high
school
dropout
from
the
inner
city
who
have
never
held
job
we
ran
camp
rodman
for
several
year
and
the
experience
cause
us
some
real
soul
search
because
there
be
more
problem
than
we
anticipate
group
of
job
corp
trainee
start
roam
around
new
bedford
at
night
get
into
fight
with
local
gang
the
incident
become
bad
and
bad
until
there
be
one
in
which
six
policeman
get
hurt
and
the
city
council
petition
president
johnson
to
close
the
camp
we
change
director
and
improve
the
discipline
but
we
never
solve
the
basic
problem
the
job
corp
trainee
have
spent
so
many
year
out
of
work
and
in
many
case
drinking
and
take
drug
that
they
have
no
real
motivation
and
therefore
it
be
virtually
impossible
for
them
to
learn
ibm
end
up
hire
very
few
camp
rodman
graduate
and
i
doubt
any
other
company
do
either
other
job
corp
camp
have
the
same
difficulty
and
the
government
finally
close
down
the
entire
project
it
seem
clear
that
to
have
any
impact
on
unemployment
we
would
have
to
get
to
people
before
they
reach
the
job
corp
stage
and
that
meant
improve
the
slum
in
which
they
be
grow
up
i
d
go
to
the
inner
city
as
a
member
of
johnson
s
anti
poverty
commission
and
the
riot
of
didn
t
surprise
me
because
i
could
see
why
people
would
want
to
tear
up
those
slum
many
of
my
business
peer
still
thought
that
in
america
if
you
work
hard
you
reach
the
top
but
it
be
obvious
to
me
that
in
the
ghetto
if
you
work
hard
the
chance
be
you
d
still
be
at
the
bottom
when
you
die
somehow
we
have
to
reestablish
the
relationship
in
those
community
between
effort
and
personal
integrity
and
reward
that
be
the
philosophy
behind
the
bedford
stuyvesant
plant
talk
to
bobby
kennedy
i
become
convince
that
what
the
ghetto
need
be
plant
in
which
people
could
acquire
skill
earn
decent
wage
and
benefit
and
develop
a
sense
of
pride
in
their
achievement
if
ibm
could
prove
such
a
plant
could
be
operate
other
company
might
follow
our
lead
and
eventually
enough
might
happen
in
the
ghetto
to
make
a
real
difference
we
lease
the
big
building
we
could
find
a
grimy
eight
story
stone
and
brick
warehouse
on
nostrand
avenue
in
the
very
center
of
bedford
stuyvesant
our
plan
be
to
employ
around
five
hundred
worker
not
as
unskilled
labor
but
in
real
ibm
job
with
good
wage
benefit
training
program
and
the
chance
to
advance
and
even
move
out
of
the
ghetto
by
transfer
to
other
ibm
plant
five
hundred
be
a
small
number
compare
with
say
our
plant
in
rochester
minnesota
where
thirty
five
hundred
people
work
but
we
be
in
uncharted
territory
and
the
handful
of
other
corporation
that
be
try
to
run
inner
city
factory
be
have
a
terrible
time
aerojet
general
in
california
for
example
hire
unskilled
youth
in
watt
and
put
them
to
work
make
tent
for
the
vietnam
war
a
business
it
knew
nothing
about
the
factory
lose
million
of
dollar
and
the
company
finally
have
to
lay
people
off
to
reduce
the
risk
of
similar
embarrassment
we
decide
we
d
stick
to
make
product
we
understood
cable
and
other
part
for
our
computer
and
that
we
d
rely
on
experienced
ibm
manager
the
man
i
picked
to
run
the
project
be
ernest
friedli
the
assistant
manager
of
our
giant
kingston
plant
friedli
be
white
but
he
d
grown
up
in
an
immigrant
family
in
a
tough
section
of
brooklyn
and
he
call
bedford
stuyvesant
my
old
neighborhood
he
could
be
pretty
blunt
at
one
point
in
the
planning
process
i
question
whether
we
ought
to
air
condition
the
plant
no
other
business
in
bedford
stuyvesant
be
air
condition
and
i
didn
t
want
it
to
look
as
if
we
be
overdo
it
friedli
come
right
back
at
me
by
say
put
yourself
in
the
place
of
a
factory
worker
suppose
you
have
to
go
up
to
endicott
for
training
and
found
air
conditioning
there
and
come
back
to
a
sleazy
non
air
condition
building
wouldn
t
that
be
bad
i
immediately
agree
that
the
last
thing
we
want
be
to
make
people
feel
like
second
class
citizen
friedli
be
a
real
leader
he
go
around
the
company
and
recruit
a
team
of
supervisor
four
black
and
two
white
ask
them
to
take
the
transfer
with
no
immediate
raise
because
this
be
a
job
that
require
dedication
all
six
say
they
d
like
to
go
the
toughest
call
i
have
to
make
be
whether
to
put
ibm
s
name
over
the
door
we
could
have
work
through
a
middleman
one
idea
be
for
us
to
find
a
black
entrepreneur
and
offer
him
financing
and
a
contract
to
serve
as
an
ibm
supplier
our
study
show
that
a
middleman
could
turn
a
profit
after
just
one
year
if
he
be
frugal
and
do
without
a
lot
of
ibm
extra
such
as
a
community
relation
manager
a
plant
psychologist
a
big
personnel
staff
maybe
even
a
plant
receptionist
vin
learson
and
other
executive
be
for
this
approach
and
so
be
i
at
first
because
it
be
much
safer
and
cheaper
but
i
change
my
mind
because
i
notice
that
other
company
be
take
middleman
approach
to
the
inner
city
and
i
thought
this
would
only
reinforce
the
resident
feel
that
nobody
want
to
bet
on
them
i
thought
the
courageous
thing
to
do
be
to
accept
the
risk
and
make
it
an
ibm
plant
we
give
the
project
a
lot
of
scrutiny
at
ibm
and
probably
the
smartest
thing
we
do
be
to
analyze
it
thoroughly
as
a
business
proposition
we
decide
to
go
ahead
in
bedford
stuyvesant
only
after
study
other
ghetto
we
might
have
go
into
for
example
and
my
involvement
in
the
community
be
only
one
of
many
factor
in
the
final
decision
kennedy
himself
never
ask
for
a
plant
nor
do
i
tell
him
of
the
plan
until
we
d
decide
to
go
ahead
we
also
study
whether
it
make
sense
to
start
the
plant
with
hard
core
unemployed
like
the
young
men
from
camp
rodman
and
the
answer
be
no
as
friedli
point
out
our
primary
goal
be
to
establish
a
factory
that
work
not
to
take
on
so
many
social
burden
that
the
operation
go
broke
of
the
first
two
hundred
bedford
stuyvesant
resident
he
hire
one
hundred
twelve
be
unemployed
and
forty
have
police
record
but
he
reject
the
applicant
with
very
serious
problem
such
as
alcohol
and
drug
friedli
s
judgment
must
have
be
just
about
right
because
the
factory
work
well
than
we
d
hop
while
we
d
expect
it
to
be
almost
a
nonprofit
operation
we
found
we
could
make
cable
and
other
component
there
at
slightly
low
cost
than
at
our
other
plant
and
bedford
stuyvesant
become
a
permanent
part
of
the
ibm
system
bobby
kennedy
would
have
be
proud
to
see
the
project
succeed
but
even
before
it
be
publicly
announce
in
april
he
have
turn
his
attention
away
from
new
york
politics
and
enter
the
presidential
race
my
last
few
meeting
with
him
have
to
do
with
that
i
remember
most
vividly
the
day
in
late
february
when
he
come
to
my
office
to
sound
me
out
on
the
issue
we
talk
for
an
hour
mostly
about
vietnam
this
be
in
the
wake
of
the
tet
offensive
which
have
swung
public
opinion
against
the
war
i
ask
him
what
he
thought
the
united
state
should
do
he
say
tom
there
be
no
sensible
easy
solution
just
none
the
only
possible
thing
to
do
be
to
get
our
people
out
how
i
d
get
out
in
any
possible
way
i
think
it
be
an
absolute
disaster
be
there
be
much
bad
than
any
of
the
shame
or
difficulty
one
would
engender
internationally
by
get
out
so
with
whatever
kind
of
apology
and
with
whatever
grace
i
could
conjure
up
i
d
get
out
of
there
in
six
month
with
all
of
the
troop
the
u
s
have
i
be
shock
by
that
his
think
be
much
more
radical
than
mine
i
be
still
transfixed
by
the
question
of
how
to
deal
with
our
south
vietnamese
ally
and
all
the
promise
we
d
make
them
but
bobby
really
wasn
t
interested
in
discuss
the
particular
of
withdrawal
he
say
that
no
matter
how
we
do
it
it
be
go
to
be
chaotic
to
him
that
be
all
of
secondary
importance
because
he
have
the
long
vision
to
see
what
the
war
be
do
to
our
country
three
month
after
he
announce
his
candidacy
early
on
the
morning
after
the
california
primary
an
ibm
executive
call
to
tell
me
bobby
have
be
shot
i
couldn
t
believe
that
two
brother
could
die
in
the
same
way
so
i
assume
he
d
only
be
slightly
wound
i
be
schedule
to
make
a
business
trip
to
the
west
coast
that
day
with
burke
marshall
and
burke
who
be
very
close
to
bobby
be
really
shaken
he
say
should
i
call
the
family
office
and
see
if
we
can
give
anybody
a
lift
on
our
plane
i
say
yes
and
he
found
out
that
jackie
and
her
brother
in
law
stas
radziwill
want
a
ride
so
i
arrange
a
car
to
take
jackie
from
the
city
to
kennedy
airport
where
stas
be
arrive
from
london
as
it
happen
the
assistant
manager
at
jfk
be
a
fellow
who
have
flown
with
me
during
the
war
i
call
him
and
say
this
be
a
tragedy
i
ve
get
to
take
jackie
to
california
with
me
i
m
go
to
get
her
on
board
and
then
we
want
to
taxi
right
up
under
the
wing
of
stas
s
airplane
and
pick
him
up
i
get
them
both
into
the
airplane
and
since
i
be
fly
we
hardly
spoke
we
make
a
rest
stop
at
grand
island
nebraska
the
exact
center
of
the
country
and
ran
into
tom
mccabe
of
scott
paper
and
a
bunch
of
republican
who
be
just
come
back
from
have
help
nelson
rockefeller
campaign
in
oregon
it
still
wasn
t
clear
to
any
of
us
that
bobby
s
condition
be
serious
but
when
we
land
in
los
angeles
chuck
spalding
a
close
friend
of
the
kennedy
family
met
us
and
rode
with
us
into
town
jackie
say
chuck
what
s
the
story
i
want
it
straight
chuck
say
well
jackie
he
s
die
then
we
knew
it
be
all
over
that
be
the
end
of
the
kennedy
era
although
the
family
have
a
fantastic
ability
to
rise
above
tragedy
and
go
on
they
even
size
me
up
briefly
as
a
replacement
for
bobby
in
the
democratic
race
not
long
after
the
assassination
i
go
to
visit
at
hyannis
and
when
i
step
off
the
airplane
a
crowd
of
little
kennedy
come
run
across
the
tarmac
wear
yellow
sweatshirt
that
say
tom
watson
for
president
jackie
have
have
them
make
up
for
the
kid
i
get
in
a
car
with
her
and
ethel
and
say
be
you
serious
why
not
why
not
they
say
but
we
all
knew
i
d
never
stand
a
chance
and
when
a
columnist
friend
of
the
family
call
a
few
day
later
to
ask
if
i
be
indeed
go
to
run
in
bobby
s
place
i
told
him
i
d
already
gotten
over
my
vague
aspiration
to
elective
office
it
take
two
more
year
of
upheaval
on
the
college
campus
for
me
to
come
around
to
bobby
s
position
on
vietnam
in
june
i
be
call
to
testify
before
the
senate
foreign
relation
committee
they
want
to
explore
the
effect
of
the
war
on
the
u
s
economy
but
i
decide
to
use
that
platform
to
make
the
strong
possible
case
for
pull
out
of
vietnam
right
away
i
say
that
as
long
as
the
war
be
allow
to
go
on
it
would
demoralize
our
young
erode
our
prestige
abroad
make
the
economy
unhealthy
and
ultimately
cause
our
society
irreparable
harm
it
s
impossible
to
figure
out
an
efficient
orderly
and
dignify
way
of
get
out
i
say
we
must
end
this
tragedy
before
it
overwhelms
us
i
do
nothing
more
than
echo
what
bobby
have
told
me
long
before
but
it
be
still
so
unusual
for
a
prominent
person
to
speak
bluntly
about
withdrawal
that
the
new
york
time
quote
me
on
the
front
page
that
be
how
far
ahead
of
us
bobby
kennedy
have
be
the
last
work
day
of
the
johnson
administration
january
be
black
friday
at
ibm
the
justice
department
file
a
massive
antitrust
complaint
accuse
us
of
monopolize
the
computer
industry
and
ask
the
court
to
break
ibm
into
piece
it
be
one
of
the
big
antitrust
case
ever
brought
comparable
to
the
one
in
when
the
u
s
take
apart
rockefeller
s
standard
oil
trust
the
government
object
to
virtually
our
entire
way
of
do
business
from
our
use
of
total
system
sale
supply
customer
with
complete
installation
include
hardware
software
engineering
help
training
and
maintenance
to
the
big
discount
we
give
university
strangely
none
of
these
practice
be
illegal
per
se
we
d
use
them
to
build
a
fantastic
industry
and
all
of
our
competitor
do
business
the
same
way
but
that
be
irrelevant
the
government
say
the
point
be
that
in
the
hand
of
a
company
of
our
size
and
strength
these
marketing
tool
become
weapon
that
crush
competition
the
justice
department
ask
the
court
to
force
us
to
change
these
practice
and
add
an
ominous
request
for
relief
by
way
of
divorcement
divestiture
and
reorganization
to
dissipate
the
effect
of
the
defendant
s
unlawful
activity
we
d
see
this
suit
come
because
we
d
be
under
investigation
by
the
justice
department
for
two
year
but
what
really
alarmed
me
be
the
precipitous
way
in
which
the
complaint
be
brought
since
the
johnson
administration
be
almost
over
i
have
thought
the
justice
department
would
hold
off
and
let
the
incoming
nixon
administration
decide
how
to
handle
the
case
that
would
have
be
reasonable
and
i
have
no
cause
to
expect
the
government
to
act
otherwise
the
antitrust
division
have
call
ibm
to
task
before
in
and
and
they
d
always
be
fair
we
d
avoid
a
showdown
in
the
court
on
both
occasion
and
have
be
able
to
compromise
with
consent
decree
that
give
ibm
plenty
of
room
to
grow
to
me
it
seem
natural
for
the
justice
department
to
keep
an
eye
on
us
because
we
dominate
an
important
industry
and
in
the
early
s
i
even
give
speech
acknowledge
the
need
for
the
sherman
and
clayton
antitrust
act
i
saw
our
deal
with
the
antitrust
division
as
part
of
a
healthy
process
of
regulation
to
protect
the
public
good
nothing
in
my
experience
prepared
me
for
how
treacherous
the
legal
process
can
be
when
it
get
out
of
hand
we
try
in
every
way
to
head
off
the
suit
burke
marshall
and
i
have
even
go
to
washington
at
the
last
minute
to
make
a
personal
appeal
to
attorney
general
ramsey
clark
that
meeting
be
one
of
the
most
uncanny
experience
of
my
life
i
d
be
witness
to
an
almost
identical
scene
as
a
young
executive
seventeen
year
before
it
be
the
justice
department
be
about
to
sue
us
for
monopolize
the
punch
card
industry
and
dad
and
i
have
go
to
washington
to
meet
with
the
attorney
general
on
that
case
tom
clark
ramsey
s
father
the
argument
that
dad
have
use
on
tom
clark
be
not
terribly
different
from
the
one
i
use
on
ramsey
i
point
out
that
the
data
processing
field
be
very
broad
and
that
the
competition
ibm
face
be
strong
and
increase
thanks
to
the
constant
evolution
of
technology
which
no
one
have
a
monopoly
on
like
his
father
before
him
ramsey
be
impervious
to
these
argument
he
refuse
to
budge
even
when
i
appeal
to
him
as
a
fellow
democrat
i
told
him
i
ve
be
loyal
to
this
party
all
my
life
and
my
father
be
a
loyal
democrat
before
me
and
it
make
me
ashamed
for
an
administration
to
behave
the
way
you
be
behaving
you
have
less
than
a
week
left
in
office
and
if
you
d
really
want
to
pursue
the
matter
you
could
have
brought
the
suit
a
year
ago
the
only
reason
you
re
do
it
now
be
that
the
republican
have
won
and
you
want
to
dump
a
big
problem
into
their
lap
the
fact
be
the
fact
ramsey
say
we
think
you
re
guilty
and
it
be
my
duty
as
attorney
general
to
bring
this
suit
i
thought
that
be
pompous
and
start
to
lose
my
temper
so
i
left
i
d
always
thought
dad
be
irrational
for
refuse
to
face
the
reality
of
antitrust
law
but
now
that
i
be
confront
by
similar
accusation
twenty
year
later
i
have
exactly
the
same
reaction
my
first
public
response
to
the
suit
echoed
a
move
dad
have
make
i
declare
our
innocence
in
the
newspaper
this
be
accomplish
with
typical
ibm
drama
by
take
out
double
page
ad
in
eighty
newspaper
all
over
the
united
state
have
ibm
spoil
the
computer
business
for
others
let
s
look
at
the
record
be
the
way
the
ad
begin
and
to
show
how
the
company
have
drawn
together
and
be
act
like
a
team
we
have
the
ibm
branch
manager
in
each
city
hand
deliver
the
copy
to
the
local
daily
those
ad
cost
ibm
three
quarter
of
a
million
dollar
almost
as
much
as
our
entire
annual
corporate
advertising
budget
but
i
thought
they
be
worth
it
because
i
want
to
reassure
our
customer
shareholder
and
employee
that
ibm
have
a
strong
case
my
own
private
impulse
after
be
spurn
by
ramsey
clark
be
to
forget
the
nicety
and
fight
like
hell
to
protect
ibm
it
be
like
some
primitive
instinct
as
though
ramsey
clark
be
threaten
my
child
this
powerful
feel
come
over
me
again
and
again
through
the
year
as
our
antitrust
problem
unfolded
when
i
sat
down
with
our
lawyer
i
d
be
perfectly
conscious
of
the
difference
between
righteousness
and
greed
one
minute
and
the
next
minute
i
d
be
plot
defensive
strategy
with
a
totally
unfettered
and
lawless
mind
only
after
i
d
figure
out
what
tactic
i
want
to
use
would
i
go
back
and
think
about
its
legality
there
be
something
wrong
with
that
thought
process
perhaps
it
be
the
best
explanation
for
why
antitrust
law
be
necessary
in
the
first
place
i
realize
now
how
dad
must
have
felt
during
all
those
year
i
urge
him
to
knuckle
under
and
settle
i
struggle
to
put
the
government
case
in
perspective
remarkably
in
spite
of
the
sweep
change
and
heavy
penalty
ask
for
by
the
government
the
reaction
on
wall
street
be
mild
our
stock
which
be
sell
at
around
three
hundred
dollar
a
share
before
the
complaint
be
file
drop
only
about
eight
point
and
investor
seem
to
figure
there
be
no
use
worry
since
the
case
would
take
year
to
resolve
that
be
reassure
news
and
it
confirm
my
sense
that
the
case
never
should
have
be
brought
i
have
be
work
for
year
to
keep
ibmers
from
take
unfair
advantage
of
our
position
in
the
industry
ibm
machine
account
for
about
percent
of
all
the
computer
sell
and
one
of
the
challenge
senior
management
face
be
not
to
exaggerate
threat
or
overreact
to
competition
particularly
in
the
s
as
we
begin
to
come
up
against
small
company
as
early
as
i
circulate
a
standard
of
ethic
about
what
our
people
could
and
could
not
do
there
be
rule
against
bare
knuckle
sell
practice
such
as
disparage
other
company
product
or
leak
information
about
machine
we
hadn
t
yet
announce
in
order
to
block
a
competitor
from
make
a
sale
perhaps
most
important
i
told
the
salesman
that
in
fight
for
order
they
have
to
show
a
sense
of
fair
play
turn
the
situation
around
suppose
that
you
be
a
competitor
small
precariously
finance
without
a
large
support
organization
and
without
a
big
reputation
in
the
field
but
with
a
good
product
how
would
you
feel
if
the
big
ibm
company
take
the
action
which
you
propose
to
take
would
you
regard
the
ibm
company
as
take
unfair
advantage
of
you
would
you
consider
that
the
ibm
company
be
use
a
sale
tactic
which
ibm
possess
solely
because
of
its
size
and
reputation
and
which
therefore
be
unavailable
to
you
we
simply
cannot
shoulder
people
around
or
give
the
appearance
of
do
so
each
year
every
salesman
be
require
to
sign
a
statement
that
he
understood
the
rule
i
want
our
record
kept
clean
because
ibm
already
have
a
great
business
we
have
no
reason
to
monopolize
no
reason
to
be
predatory
in
our
action
it
would
have
be
stupid
in
spite
of
all
our
effort
we
often
found
it
hard
to
pull
our
punch
especially
against
company
who
jumped
into
the
business
to
piggyback
on
our
success
in
the
late
s
a
whole
crop
of
new
business
sprang
up
specialize
in
cut
rate
disk
drive
terminal
and
other
peripheral
design
to
plug
into
system
equipment
these
so
call
plug
compatible
manufacturer
or
pcms
take
business
away
from
some
of
the
most
lucrative
segment
of
our
product
line
and
be
a
constant
annoyance
because
they
be
parasite
they
be
terribly
vulnerable
to
any
move
we
make
and
we
face
a
legal
and
customer
relation
dilemma
whenever
it
be
time
for
us
to
update
our
design
or
low
our
price
say
for
example
ibm
s
engineer
write
an
improve
piece
of
software
could
we
introduce
it
if
as
a
side
effect
it
would
cause
our
computer
to
reject
data
that
be
be
store
on
a
brand
x
disk
could
we
introduce
it
even
if
this
in
turn
might
put
the
brand
x
disk
corporation
out
of
business
it
be
a
very
gray
area
of
the
law
we
be
forever
ask
our
lawyer
for
opinion
and
get
mystify
answer
like
if
you
release
the
product
that
way
you
have
a
forty
percent
risk
of
get
in
trouble
this
make
the
business
very
difficult
to
manage
and
in
addition
to
the
justice
department
complaint
we
be
slap
with
more
than
a
half
dozen
additional
antitrust
suit
by
plug
compatible
manufacturer
computer
lease
firm
and
other
company
all
claim
we
d
try
to
do
them
in
the
most
important
of
these
be
a
suit
file
by
control
data
a
minneapolis
computer
maker
whose
lawyer
work
in
close
cooperation
with
the
justice
department
republican
have
never
be
know
as
trustbuster
and
it
wasn
t
clear
that
the
administration
would
take
a
hard
line
although
nixon
s
new
antitrust
chief
told
reporter
that
he
would
pursue
the
case
vigorously
we
try
to
mollify
them
by
cleaning
up
our
act
voluntarily
six
month
after
the
suit
be
file
we
make
the
drastic
move
of
abandon
an
age
old
marketing
practice
know
as
bundling
a
key
element
in
our
total
sale
approach
it
have
always
be
our
custom
whenever
we
rent
or
sell
a
machine
to
lump
everything
together
in
a
single
price
hardware
software
engineering
help
maintenance
and
even
training
session
for
the
customer
s
staff
this
practice
date
all
the
way
back
to
the
day
of
herman
hollerith
the
inventor
of
the
punch
card
machine
and
it
have
be
a
powerful
method
for
make
customer
feel
secure
enough
to
try
computer
when
the
technology
be
still
new
and
hard
to
understand
burke
marshall
however
be
shock
to
find
ibm
do
business
in
this
way
he
saw
bundling
as
a
glare
violation
of
antitrust
law
know
as
a
tie
in
sale
such
as
when
a
local
electric
company
try
to
dictate
the
appliance
you
buy
for
your
house
by
require
customer
to
buy
our
product
by
the
bundle
we
be
make
it
almost
impossible
for
independent
company
specialize
say
in
software
to
break
into
the
business
at
first
people
at
ibm
have
trouble
grasp
this
no
one
could
understand
what
marshall
object
to
bundling
be
like
the
apostle
creed
at
ibm
and
since
we
look
at
what
we
be
do
as
sell
a
service
it
seem
perfectly
natural
that
there
should
be
one
all
inclusive
price
burke
marshall
be
a
mild
man
but
as
the
public
official
of
mississippi
and
alabama
learn
from
his
work
at
the
civil
right
division
he
also
have
a
precise
mind
and
an
unbendable
will
in
he
stood
up
at
an
executive
conference
and
told
us
that
thing
have
to
change
we
be
go
to
have
to
undo
the
bundle
and
price
each
of
our
good
and
service
separately
but
why
people
kept
ask
why
change
now
he
go
through
his
explanation
again
and
again
until
finally
he
lose
his
temper
because
you
ve
get
a
tie
goddammit
you
ve
get
a
tie
it
s
illegal
if
you
try
to
defend
it
in
court
you
ll
lose
he
be
shout
in
a
voice
an
octave
above
normal
i
go
back
to
my
room
with
learson
and
a
couple
of
others
the
guy
really
mean
this
somebody
say
and
i
decide
that
we
ought
to
follow
burke
s
advice
rather
than
risk
a
showdown
in
court
in
june
after
month
of
hectic
preparation
under
the
apt
code
name
new
world
we
announce
la
carte
price
for
our
system
engineering
service
customer
training
and
some
of
our
software
some
executive
thought
we
be
give
up
our
birthright
that
unbundling
meant
the
death
of
the
system
sell
technique
on
which
my
father
have
built
ibm
but
to
me
the
bundle
be
simply
another
tradition
that
have
to
go
just
as
we
have
agree
in
to
sell
our
machine
as
well
as
rent
them
and
to
license
our
patent
to
other
company
there
have
be
doomsayers
before
those
move
as
well
but
ibm
have
prosper
which
make
the
antitrust
law
easy
for
me
to
accept
we
want
a
quick
settlement
with
the
government
and
might
have
succeed
if
the
justice
department
hadn
t
found
the
perfect
ally
in
its
plan
to
litigate
against
ibm
it
be
control
data
which
in
december
have
file
a
massive
antitrust
suit
against
us
that
closely
parallel
uncle
sam
s
of
all
ibm
s
competitor
in
all
my
year
of
management
control
data
be
the
bad
thorn
in
my
side
it
have
be
found
in
by
a
team
of
electronics
engineer
who
have
work
together
since
the
war
include
a
number
of
year
at
remington
rand
their
leader
be
an
entrepreneur
name
william
norris
and
their
top
computer
architect
be
seymour
cray
a
skinny
reclusive
fellow
who
quickly
become
an
industry
legend
norris
s
skill
as
a
businessman
and
cray
s
genius
have
make
control
data
one
of
the
industry
s
great
success
story
grow
in
six
year
from
nothing
to
annual
sale
of
more
than
sixty
million
dollar
their
specialty
be
building
big
ultra
fast
machine
for
the
scientific
market
what
people
now
call
supercomputer
these
product
appeal
to
the
same
clientele
that
give
the
computer
industry
its
impetus
in
the
first
place
weapon
lab
airplane
and
rocket
manufacturer
elite
university
customer
who
be
willing
to
fork
over
million
of
dollar
for
the
fast
state
of
the
art
processor
before
control
data
come
along
ibm
have
be
at
the
top
of
the
supercomputing
game
our
flagship
project
in
the
late
s
be
a
machine
call
stretch
that
grow
out
of
a
contract
with
the
weapon
lab
at
los
alamo
stretch
be
the
brainchild
of
an
engineer
name
stephen
dunwell
and
be
go
to
be
ibm
s
masterpiece
it
be
a
dare
design
with
all
sort
of
exotic
innovation
we
promise
customer
that
it
would
perform
a
hundred
time
as
fast
as
our
big
commercial
processor
look
back
i
think
stretch
be
so
ambitious
that
it
be
a
wonder
we
get
it
built
at
all
but
when
it
come
out
in
behind
schedule
and
only
percent
as
powerful
as
plan
i
be
disappointed
and
irate
i
thought
our
engineer
need
to
be
taught
a
lesson
about
not
let
customer
down
so
in
the
course
of
a
press
conference
at
an
industry
convention
i
announce
that
the
new
computer
have
fail
to
meet
specification
and
that
i
be
hereby
cut
the
price
on
the
machine
from
million
to
million
to
reflect
its
performance
we
couldn
t
make
any
money
at
that
price
and
before
long
the
project
get
shelve
make
an
example
out
of
stretch
shook
up
the
engineer
all
right
but
it
turn
out
to
be
a
grievous
mistake
the
engineer
understood
me
to
be
say
no
more
of
those
big
machine
around
here
and
it
be
true
that
i
would
have
snap
at
anybody
who
brought
up
the
subject
so
for
two
year
ibm
do
almost
nothing
in
supercomputing
leave
the
field
wide
open
for
norris
and
his
men
in
august
come
their
bombshell
a
machine
call
the
that
everyone
recognize
as
a
triumph
of
engineering
for
seven
million
dollar
it
deliver
three
time
the
power
of
stretch
word
of
the
new
machine
make
me
furious
because
i
thought
the
distinction
of
building
the
world
s
fast
computer
should
belong
to
ibm
at
that
point
the
system
be
the
most
advanced
set
of
design
we
have
and
nothing
in
that
whole
product
plan
be
even
remotely
comparable
to
the
on
august
i
sent
my
top
men
a
memo
last
week
control
data
have
a
press
conference
during
which
they
officially
announce
their
system
i
understand
that
in
the
laboratory
develop
this
system
there
be
only
people
include
the
janitor
of
these
be
engineer
and
be
programmer
and
only
one
person
have
a
ph
d
a
relatively
junior
programmer
contrast
this
modest
effort
with
our
own
vast
development
activity
i
fail
to
understand
why
we
have
lose
our
industry
leadership
position
by
let
someone
else
offer
the
world
s
most
powerful
computer
this
note
eventually
introduce
as
evidence
in
the
antitrust
suit
become
famous
as
the
janitor
memorandum
it
wasn
t
illegal
but
it
be
where
our
trouble
begin
because
the
move
ibm
make
in
response
to
my
anger
be
too
close
to
the
limit
of
the
law
even
though
our
engineering
staff
be
overload
we
try
to
catch
up
with
control
data
and
at
the
system
unveil
the
follow
april
we
say
we
would
bring
out
a
supercomputer
at
the
top
of
the
line
that
would
leapfrog
control
data
s
machine
control
data
hadn
t
yet
deliver
its
first
and
the
effect
of
this
announcement
be
to
put
a
chill
on
its
market
suddenly
it
become
hard
for
their
salesman
to
close
deal
even
though
our
supercomputer
didn
t
exist
yet
a
lot
of
customer
decide
to
hold
off
until
they
could
get
a
look
in
those
day
virtually
every
computer
company
use
this
tactic
of
announce
paper
machine
to
keep
a
competitor
from
get
too
far
ahead
but
it
be
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
i
d
told
our
salesman
to
be
careful
about
because
of
ibm
s
great
size
the
impact
of
our
announcement
on
control
data
be
so
great
that
norris
cut
his
price
in
a
panic
and
the
company
plunge
into

meanwhile
we
have
embarrass
ourselves
by
announce
four
different
version
of
our
supercomputer
and
still
not
deliver
a
one
finally
my
business
sense
overcame
my
pride
and
i
belatedly
figure
out
that
we
couldn
t
compete
with
control
data
for
the
same
reason
that
general
motor
can
t
compete
with
ferrari
in
building
two
hundred
mile
an
hour
sport
car
supercomputer
have
become
so
highly
specialized
that
even
if
we
come
up
with
a
design
equal
to
theirs
it
would
never
fit
in
with
the
rest
of
our
product
line
our
style
of
sell
our
volume
and
profit
target
and
so
on
i
be
afraid
to
twist
ibm
inside
out
try
to
capture
what
be
actually
a
small
segment
of
the
market
control
data
outsold
us
more
than
fifteen
to
one
and
in
the
end
we
cancel
our
supercomputer
program
after
deliver
only
a
limited
number
of
machine
because
my
temper
be
partly
to
blame
for
ibm
s
erratic
behavior
in
the
supercomputer
market
i
felt
personally
responsible
for
the
control
data
lawsuit
norris
want
compensation
for
the
ordeal
we
have
put
his
company
through
his
salesman
have
kept
detailed
record
of
ibm
s
tactic
as
we
fought
for
supercomputer
account
and
the
suit
list
no
few
than
thirty
seven
different
way
in
which
we
have
supposedly
abuse
our

power
the
suit
be
so
detailed
and
specific
that
industry
wag
nickname
it
the
ibm
sale
manual
the
most
famous
accusation
which
come
directly
from
the
supercomputer
race
be
that
ibm
have
market
paper
machine
and
phantom
computer
in
order
to
block
control
data
from
win
order
i
never
met
norris
but
he
be
a
formidable
adversary
because
of
his
understand
of
the
industry
and
the
depth
of
his
antagonism
for
ibm

share

the

this

our

up
into
the
ten
of

we
have
the

we

who
arrive
just
after

guide
us
to
the

perhaps
i
should
have
be
more
optimistic
but
it
depressed
me
to
see
ibm
back
in
the
lawyer
hand
the
antitrust
case
begin
to
color
everything
we
do
for
year
every
executive
decision
even
one
that
be
fairly
routine
have
to
be
make
with
one
eye
on
how
it
might
affect
the
lawsuit
to
keep
damn
evidence
to
a
minimum
the
lawyer
even
dictate
what
we
could
and
couldn
t
say
at
meeting
there
be
all
sort
of
code
word
and
strange
us
of
language
for
example
the
executive
in
our
computer
division
be
told
to
avoid
military
metaphor
when
talk
about
beating
the
competition
and
if
ibm
have
more
than
fifty
percent
of
a
give
market
they
be
suppose
to
use
the
phrase
market
leadership
instead
of
market
share
this
sort
of
mealymouthing
go
against
my
instinct
i
want
ibm
to
be
the
best
in
everything
and
recognize
as
such
which
meant
make
no
apology
and
capture
more
market
share
than
anybody
else
instead
we
be
slowly
tie
ourselves
in
knot
in
and
because
of
the
double
drag
of
the
lawsuit
and
a
recession
ibm
s
annual
growth
slump
to
less
than
five
percent
down
from
the
nearly
thirty
percent
we
d
achieve
in
each
of
the
two
previous
year
all
my
life
my
answer
to
complicate
circumstance
have
be
to
make
a
dramatic
and
decisive
move
but
this
time
there
be
no
such
move
to
make
i
remember
agonize
over
how
we
could
settle
the
justice
department
suit
and
avoid
the
risk
of
go
into
court
the
consent
decree
that
end
our
previous
case
have
be
reasonable
and
my
inclination
be
to
make
another
deal
but
all
the
justice
department
be
offering
us
this
time
be
the
death
penalty
they
want
to
dismantle
our
company
so
that
instead
of
one
billion
a
year
company
ibm
would
become
seven
billion
company
that
be
something
i
couldn
t
accept
at
the
begin
i
be
willing
to
split
ibm
in
two
with
one
half
devote
to
make
large
computer
and
the
other
to
small
we
could
have
operate
that
way
even
though
the
split
would
have
be
traumatic
but
the
justice
department
wasn
t
interested
and
over
the
course
of
the
suit
increase
competition
from
japan
weigh
against
any
divestiture
at
all
because
we
need
all
of
our
mass
and
might
to
fight
competitor
such
as
fujitsu
and
nec
our
only
choice
be
to
let
the
case
drag
on
four
year
later
i
finally
have
an
opportunity
to
move
decisively
in
late
the
pretrial
maneuvering
in
the
control
data
suit
be
finally
come
to
a
close
and
the
lawyer
at
cravath
recommend
that
we
d
be
wise
to
settle
out
of
court
vin
learson
negotiate
the
deal
which
cost
ibm
a
small
fortune
it
involve
sell
norris
our
service
bureau
corporation
subsidiary
for
a
fraction
of
its
real
worth
this
be
a
million
a
year
business
that
do
data
processing
job
for
customer
whose
own
computer
be
overload
or
who
didn
t
have
computer
of
their
own
control
data
operate
a
pretty
large
service
bureau
of
its
own
and
the
addition
of
ours
make
them
the
world
s
large
supplier
of
computer
service
we
also
give
norris
a
package
of
cash
and
contract
worth
million
include
million
to
cover
his
legal
fee
in
spite
of
the
expense
this
settlement
be
a
brilliant
tactical
stroke
on
the
part
of
cravath
because
of
all
the
work
control
data
have
do
in
analyze
and
index
our
document
their
suit
be
the
master
link
in
all
the
other
antitrust
suit
against
ibm
that
computerize
index
now
become
the
property
of
ibm
because
it
be
customary
in
out
of
court
settlement
for
the
two
side
to
exchange
their
lawyer
paperwork
as
a
way
of
bury
the
hatchet
we
get
the
so
call
work
product
from
their
lawyer
and
give
them
ours
and
that
night
bruce
bromley
come
to
my
office
you
ve
get
to
destroy
that
index
right
away
he
say
my
god
isn
t
that
illegal
i
say
it
s
perfectly
legal
we
ve
spent
million
of
dollar
to
get
them
to
drop
the
suit
and
we
get
the
work
product
as
part
of
the
settlement
it
belongs
to
us
now
i
can
understand
that
we
own
the
work
product
but
it
seem
to
me
there
be
something
wrong
about
destroy
evidence
aren
t
there
law
against
that
yes
but
this
isn
t
evidence
and
it
never
be
technically
speak
it
s
nothing
more
than
a
set
of
file
that
use
to
belong
to
their
lawyer
and
now
belongs
to
you
you
can
do
whatever
you
want
with
it
we
both
knew
full
well
that
the
index
could
eventually
be
use
to
marshal
evidence
in
the
other
lawsuit
that
be
still
pending
business
sense
dictate
my
answer
if
i
didn
t
take
the
lawyer
advice
i
would
be
place
ibm
under
a
terrific
handicap
i
have
no
choice
burn
it
i
say
they
destroyed
the
index
that
very
night
a
few
day
later
there
be
a
flurry
about
this
in
the
newspaper
because
the
justice
department
and
a
lot
of
people
in
the
industry
felt
that
destroy
the
index
be
improper
but
there
be
nothing
they
could
do
and
their
investigation
be
hobble
after
that
i
never
be
totally
comfortable
about
that
decision
even
though
i
have
a
fiduciary
responsibility
to
protect
the
investment
of
ibm
shareholder
and
even
though
the
best
lawyer
money
could
buy
assure
me
i
wasn
t
break
any
law
it
make
me
feel
uneasy
without
control
data
around
to
help
the
justice
department
s
case
deteriorate
into
a
courthouse
mess
judge
edelstein
let
thing
get
completely
out
of
hand
he
refuse
to
set
limit
either
on
the
issue
the
justice
department
be
allow
to
add
as
the
case
progress
or
the
amount
of
evidence
or
witness
we
could
use
to
respond
he
left
crucial
motion
undecided
for
month
and
make
arbitrary
ruling
that
shock
lawyer
on
both
side
such
as
insist
that
deposition
be
take
in
court
rather
than
at
the
office
or
home
of
the
witness
as
be
customary
the
lawyer
have
to
spend
month
reading
deposition
into
the
court
record
with
judge
edelstein
mostly
absent
from
the
bench
i
sometimes
thought
he
be
overwhelmed
and
afraid
to
come
to
grip
with
the
case
as
time
go
by
he
become
so
hostile
toward
our
lawyer
and
witness
that
we
try
to
have
him
remove
the
case
drag
on
for
twelve
year
until
the
reagan
administration
finally
drop
it
in
look
back
i
see
a
lot
of
sad
irony
in
the
whole
affair
i
think
a
lot
of
people
would
agree
that
at
the
outset
the
justice
department
s
complaint
have
merit
ibm
be
clearly
in
a
command
position
in
the
market
and
some
of
our
tactic
have
be
harsh
we
eliminate
many
of
these
practice
ourselves
and
our
overall
record
during
the
case
be
pretty
clean
but
i
ve
always
thought
that
if
judge
edelstein
have
carry
the
suit
along
rapidly
we
d
likely
have
end
up
with
a
consent
decree
in
which
we
might
have
formally
agree
to
hold
back
from
announce
our
machine
until

away
whatever

about
a
very
different
kind
of
life
in
the
top
drawer
of
my
desk
mixed
in
with
memo
about

and
old
letter
from

a
secret

into
a
seven
billion
dollar

and
in
my
heart
of
heart
i
felt
that
i
d
take
it
as
far
as
i
want
to
go
i
be
fifty
six
year

of

that
i
be

something
practically
every
night
and
spending
as
much
time
on
the
road
as
at

i
d
live
this
way
for
more
than
fifteen
year
and
dad
have
kept
it
up
all
his
life
but
i
be
bone
tire
and
fooling
myself
that
the
fast
pace

t
bother
me
during
one
hectic
week
i
flew
to
chicago
to
give
a
speech
and
in
the
half
hour
i
have
to
myself

the
thought
suddenly
come
to
me
i
can
t
keep
this
up
something
be
go
to
break
but
i
push
the
idea
out
of
my
mind
the
nixon

which
start
in
mid
be
longer
and
deeper
than
anybody
have
predict
and
ibm
hit
the
first
serious
downturn
of
my
career
not
only
do
our
sale
stay
flat
but
profit
actually
begin
to
sink
for
the
first
time
since
the
war
give
wall
street
the
idea
that
ibm
s
glory
day
might
finally
be
over
in
the
first
eight
month
of
our
stock

almost
half
its
value

as
i
might

bad
and
bad
as

i
knew
the
ambassadorship

proud
of
it

a
weight
off
my
heart
to
see
my
brother

despite
my
mismanagement
to
the
high
stature
anyone
in
our
family
have
attain
still
at
the
same
time
it
be
painful
for
me
to
think
that

step
down
there
would
be
no
watson

habit
of

time

how
much
the

and
urge
him
to
grab
it
she
be
happy
that
i
come
to
see
her
and
in
those
final
month
we
developed
a
warm
relationship
be
there
day
after
day
be
the
best
way
i
have
to
tell
her
that
in
spite
of
our
past
difference
i
admire
her
and

sorrow
that
she
be

up
on
me
and
there
be
no
escape

as
taut
as
before
by

my
discouragement

people
who
work
around
me
say
that
i
become
more
and
more
volatile

over
petty
detail
like

him
as
a
merry
guy
who
love
to
play
practical
joke
and
always
get
me
to
laugh
i
be
suppose
to
go
to
his

the
follow
morning
that
night
i
woke
up
with
a
pain
in
my
chest
it
wasn
t
very
intense
but
it
wouldn
t
go
away
olive
be
in
the
caribbean
with
friend
so
i
drove
myself
to
the
emergency
room
at
greenwich
hospital
where
they
put
me
on
a
monitor
by
morning

speaker
inside

and
i
say
why

all
you
fellow
gathering
around
here
my
voice
be
weak
because
i
be
slowly
lose
consciousness
then
i
say
oh
i
know
so
each
of
you
can
render
my
estate
a
bill
ha
ha
and
i
be
out
if
my
father
have
ever
be
struck
down
in
this
way
ibm
would
have
be
paralyze
because
it
be
a
one
man

but
when
i
get
sick

on
pretty
smoothly
vin

to
the
intensive

i
put
ibm
in
his
hand
until
i
could
get
healthy
again
i
didn
t
want
to
make
decision
from
a
hospital
bed
then
i
call
al
williams
who
be
the
senior
member
of
the
board
and
told
him

energetic
attractive
man
over

next
three

long
talk
with
me
about
what
a
heart
attack

how
serious
mine

be
how
long
i
d
need
to

and
so
forth
finally

than
any
patient
i
ever
have
i
m
try
to
avoid
have
another
one
i
say
well
as
long
as
we
re
on
the
subject
what

you
planning
to
do
when
you

out
of
here

in
the
eye
and
say
why
don
t
you
get
out
right
now
i
be
so
stun
by
this
suggestion
that
i
couldn
t
think
about
anything
else
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
realize
that
the
strain
of
run
ibm
have
take
a
huge
toll
now
i
be
be
offer
a
way
to
step
down
with
honor
the
next
morning
i
saw
the
sun
come
up
outside
my
window
and
felt
well
than
i
have
in
decade
i
decide
that
as
long
as
i
be
in
the
hospital
i
d
stop
worry
about
ibm
i
sent
for
the
secret
list
of
adventure
that
have
be
in
my
desk
drawer
for
year
most
of
the
item
on
the
list
be
too
arduous
for
a
recover
heart
attack
victim
to
consider
but
i
thought
i
could
sail
before
long
i
be
happily
immerse
in
plan
for
a
new
sailboat
design
for
voyage
rather
than
speed
i
get
olin
stephen
the
yacht
designer
to
come
to
the
hospital
with
paul
wolter
palawan
s
professional
captain
and
we
spread
sketch
out
on
the
bed
i
start
reread
the
journal
of
captain
cook
which
i
d
love
as
a
boy
and
i
be
amuse
to
find
a
comment
i
could
almost
have
write
myself
it
be
from
cook
s
letter
to
a
friend
upon
be
retire
to
a
desk
job
in
greenwich
england
after
a
decade
of
roam
the
sea
my
fate
drive
me
from
one
extreme
to
another
a
few
month
ago
the
whole
southern
hemisphere
be
hardly
big
enough
for
me
and
now
i
be
go
to
be
confine
within
the
limit
of
greenwich
which
be
far
too
small
for
an
active
mind
like
mine
i
must
however
confess
it
be
a
fine
retreat
and
a
pretty
income
but
whether
i
can
bring
myself
to
like
ease
and
retirement
time
will
shew
less
than
a
year
after
cook
write
this
complaint
he
manage
to
obtain
the
command
of
two
ship
and
be
off
on
his
third
and
last
great
voyage
if
cook
could
fight
his
way
out
of
the
doldrums
of
retirement
and
take
to
the
sea
so
could
i
i
thought
know
of
my
ambition
my
brother
sent
me
a
very
large
oil
painting
of
a
th
century
english
sail
ship
enter
portsmouth
harbor
after
a
long
voyage
the
note
say
i
hope
this
be
the
big
get
well
card
you
ll
receive
ibm
seem
very
far
away
indeed
i
come
home
thirty
day
after
the
heart
attack
and
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
be
go
to
my
sister
s
funeral
she
die
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
she
be
only
fifty
five
but
i
guess
everyone
in
our
family
felt
reconcile
to
her
death
because
it
have
be
expect
and
we
d
all
be
able
to
say
good
bye
after
that
i
have
to
face
the
slow
ordeal
of
recuperate
physically
and
emotionally
from
my
illness
when
you
have
a
heart
attack
you
realize
how
fragile
your
body

i
felt
that
mine
have
let
me
down
damn
near
entirely
and
for
several
month
i
have
very
volatile
reaction
to
insignificant
thing
olive
bore
the
brunt
of
my
anger
and
bitterness
she
have
fix
up
a
very
comfortable
room
for
me
on
the
ground
floor
of
our
house
because
i
wasn
t
suppose
to
climb

she
put
book
in
there
that
she
knew
i
d
like
painting
and
so
on
when

saw
she
even
have
a
miniature
air
horn
on
the
nightstand
a
small
version
of
the
kind
of
horn
they
use
to
call
time
out
at
basketball
game
what

s
in
case

blow
that
and
we
ll
come

try
it
and
the
valve
must
have
be
clog
because

never
hear
this
i
make
a
big
stink
about
it
which
be
awful
of
me
she
d
obviously
put
a
lot
of
time
and
thought
into
prepare
that
room
and
i
should
have
be
grateful
instead
of
act
like
an
angry
fool
i
kept
to
myself
during
the
week
that
follow
work
on
my
plan
for
the
new
boat
in
the
barn
behind
our
house
paul
wolter
built
full
size
mockups
of
section
of
the
hull
i
wasn
t
suppose
to
get
out
of
bed
but
i
d
sneak
out
there
and
look
at
the
mock
ups
for
hour
imagine
what
the
boat
would
be
like
and
debate
with
paul
about
the
change
we
ought
to
make
finally
after
a
couple
of
month
have
pass
i
go
back
to
ibm
and
told
people
i
be
think
of
get
out
the
board
of
director
do
everything
in
the
world
to
keep
me
in
the
company
they
come
to
me
individually
and
as
a
group
you
re
so
valuable
to
the
business
they
say
can
t
you
just
arrange
your
schedule
so
you
re
under
less
stress
ibm
have
one
of
the
best
board
in
the
world
but
all
board
have
a
common
fail
if
the
chief
executive
have
do
well
they
won
t
push
for
a
successor
to
be
designate
until
something
go
wrong
and
then
they
often
end
up
hire
a
new
man
pell
mell
from
outside
all
the
same
i
try
it
their
way
for
a
little
while
the
doctor
have
told
me
to
do
a
lot
of
walk
to
build
up
my
heart
so
i
d
leave
my
office
and
pace
endlessly
around
the
ground
of
our
headquarters
the
doctor
also
order
me
to
lie
down
for
an
hour
or
two
after
lunch
so
each
day
i
d
eat
and
then
lie
down
but
you
can
t
run
a
big
company
like
that
i
d
get
up
from
my
couch
and
look
into
the
outer
office
and
i
d
see
people
with
important
problem
sit
there
cool
their
heel
that
wasn
t
the
example
i
want
to
set
after
two
month
i
finally
go
to
the
board
and
told
them
it
wasn
t
go
to
work
i
knew
i
be
do
the
right
thing
i
want
to
live
more
than
i
want
to
run
ibm
it
be
a
choice
my
father
never
would
have
make
but
i
think
he
would
have
respect
it
i
wrestle
with
the
question
of
who
be
to
run
the
company
after
me
a
year
earlier
when
dick
left
for
paris
i
d
decide
on
frank
cary
as
my
successor
frank
be
really
everybody
s
choice
he
be
head
of
ibm
s
computer
division
in
the
u
s
and
have
emerge
as
a
natural
leader
even
though
his
management
style
be
utterly
different
from
mine
frank
be
a
brilliant
business
analyst
cool
impartial
and
totally
self
confident
he
rarely
spoke
up
at
meeting
and
it
wasn
t
his
style
to
step
in
and
save
the
day
the
way
learson
and
i
do
he
didn
t
make
heroic
move
and
he
didn
t
make
glare
mistake
when
he
ran
into
a
problem
he
simply
figure
out
how
to
fix
it
a
lot
of
people
attribute
frank
s
mute
style
to
the
fact
that
he
come
from
california
he
be
one
of
the
talented
young
manager
al
williams
have
turn
up
in
when
he
scour
the
company
for
mba
at
one
point
frank
be
a
district
manager
in
chicago
and
i
d
flown
out
to
look
him
over
he
seem
unprepossessing
at
first
sight
but
talk
to
me
didn
t
appear
to
intimidate
him
in
the
least
when
i
bore
in
with
question
his
answer
be
straightforward
and
calm
i
call
williams
and
say
we
ve
get
to
bring
this
guy
east
as
soon
as
frank
get
to
new
york
he
begin
to
shine
and
that
be
without
al
or
me
champion
him
he
start
at
about
the
fourth
echelon
of
management
and
pass
muster
with
a
lot
of
other
boss
before
he
get
to
us
the
heart
attack
threw
my
frank
cary
plan
into
disarray
because
it
hinge
on
the
assumption
that
i
d
be
around
three
more
year
until
i
turn
sixty
the
retirement
age
all
the
senior
executive
have
agree
upon
if
i
d
make
it
that
far
vin
who
be
old
would
have
retire
first
and
frank
would
have
have
a
clear
path
to
the
top
but
when
i
decide
to
step
down
vin
be
only
fifty
eight
with
a
year
and
a
half
to
go
before
his
retirement
even
though
cary
be
the
man
we
d
picked
to
run
the
company
long
term
vin
be
end
a
long
and
dramatic
career
and
clearly
have
a
claim
on
the
top
job
i
resolve
the
question
by
name
him
chairman
and
chief
executive
for
that
eighteen
month
span
i
give
the
board
my
letter
of
resignation
at
the
end
of
june
agree
to
stay
on
as
head
of
the
board
s
executive
committee
just
as
al
williams
have
in
the
first
stage
of
his
retirement
bill
moore
the
chairman
of
banker
trust
and
head
of
the
compensation
committee
ask
what
do
you
want
to
be
paid
and
i
laugh
because
it
be
so
much
easy
to
negotiate
my
salary
now
than
it
have
be
after
dad
s
death
i
told
him
i
d
finish
the
current
year
at
full
salary
that
the
next
year
i
d
take
half
pay
and
that
in
the
final
year
i
d
work
but
take
no
pay
at
all
i
fully
intend
to
let
my
responsibility
taper
off
and
i
didn
t
want
to
feel
any
obligation
to
show
up
at
the
office
finally
i
go
sail
as
i
d
be
longing
to
do
i
don
t
think
i
understood
at
the
time
why
i
felt
so
compel
to
sail
or
the
depth
of
the
emotional
turmoil
i
be
in
so
much
of
what
be
important
to
me
have
suddenly
be
take
away
my
ibm
career
be
over
my
license
to
fly
airplane
suspend
because
of
the
heart
attack
and
lurk
underneath
be
my
terror
at
realize
my
life
instead
of
be
long
like
dad
s
might
be
short
like
jane
s
only
in
retrospect
can
i
see
how
panicked
i
be
but
at
the
time
i
knew
instinctively
that
sail
would
rescue
me
dr
newberg
have
say
you
re
either
go
to
be
a
heart
attack
invalid
always
try
to
be
near
a
hospital
so
you
can
check
in
for
the
next
one
or
you
can
try
to
forget
about
hospital
altogether
i
want
to
forget
and
my
solution
be
to
head
for
a
remote
place
where
no
hospital
be
i
get
paul
wolter
and
we
take
the
palawan
up
around
the
island
of
newfoundland
we
brought
a
crew
of
young
men
to
do
the
heavy
work
and
an
old
friend
name
ed
thorne
who
be
a
great
companion
and
excellent
seaman
ed
knew
he
be
go
sail
with
a
captain
who
might
drop
dead
at
any
minute
but
he
be
game
before
we
left
he
go
to
see
dr
newberg
who
take
an
orange
and
taught
him
how
to
give
an
emergency
injection
of
morphine
i
carry
morphine
along
because
i
knew
heart
pain
could
be
excruciate
when
we
put
out
to
sea
i
worried
each
night
when
i
go
to
bed
that
i
might
wake
up
die
and
have
no
doctor
around
as
it
happen
one
day
we
anchor
in
front
of
the
grenfell
mission
hospital
on
newfoundland
s
great
northern
peninsula
and
it
cross
my
mind
that
this
might
be
my
last
chance
to
get
off
the
palawan
alive
but
then
i
put
the
fear
behind
me
and
i
m
glad
i
do
because
it
would
have
be
awful
to
live
with
that
kind
of
dependency
the
weather
be
rough
but
we
kept
pound
along
for
a
month
and
the
trip
work
out
well
than
i
have
a
right
to
expect
in
reality
i
be
still
pretty
frail
olive
be
wait
for
me
when
we
get
back
to
north
haven
but
the
way
i
d
behave
since
my
heart
attack
have
take
a
terrible
toll
on
our
marriage
i
must
have
thought
that
i
have
to
get
well
all
by
myself
because
i
d
do
everything
i
could
to
push
her
away
i
d
be
self
absorbed
unappreciative
and
rude
a
fairly
common
reaction
among
heart
attack
victim
i
ve
be
told
olive
be
constantly
try
to
keep
me
amuse
but
if
something
wasn
t
to
my
like
i
d
snap
don
t
you
know
i
can
t
do
that
with
my
heart
condition
when
i
come
back
from
the
newfoundland
voyage
our
marriage
be
hang
by
a
thread
nine
month
of
frustration
come
boil
out
in
a
bitter
fight
and
olive
finally
say
i
can
t
stand
this
anymore
fine
i
say
i
can
t
either
i
left
and
go
out
west
with
some
friend
as
far
as
olive
be
concerned
that
be
the
last
straw
we
d
be
married

bad
mistake
of
my
life
by
the
time

we
be
leave
for
sweden
on
a
second
honeymoon
olive
and
tom
we
have
a
tough
time
put
our
marriage
back
together
there
be
blow
ups
mainly
cause
by
me
at
one
point
when
it
look
like
we
might
separate
again
i
decide
i
have
to
try
a
psychiatrist
the
only
time
in
my
life
i
ve
ever
go
we
need
help
i
told
him
but
there
s
no
point
in
bring
olive
in
here
because
she
doesn
t
like
to
analyze
emotional
matter
he
say
tell
me
about
you
and
what
your
problem
be
so
i
give
him
a
short
rundown
of
my
life
then
i
talk
about
our
marriage
and
occasionally
he
d
throw
in
a
question
such
as
do
you
ever
have
an
argument
at
breakfast
or
do
you
ever
have
argument
over
the
child
we
d
have
terrible
argument
over
the
child
so
i
concentrate
on
that
around
the
middle
of
the
third
session
i
say
i
guess
what
you
re
try
to
tell
me
be
that
the
woman
be
do
her
damnedest
to
get
thing
right
and
i
never
give
her
any
credit
i
keep
try
to
win
every
fight
i
guess
i
ve
get
to
lose
some
that
sound
about
right
he
say
i
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
how
to
be
a
reasonable
husband
but
i
be
finally
get
the
message
that
i
couldn
t
run
my
life
like
ibm
the
nixon
recession
end
and
during
vin
learson
s
short
term
as
chief
executive
ibm
have
good
result
by
the
time
frank
cary
take
over
in
january
the
company
be
grow
rapidly
again
and
annual
revenue
be
up
near
the
ten
billion
dollar
mark
i
be
preoccupy
with
recuperate
and
as
long
as
vin
be
on
top
i
hardly
felt
as
if
i
d
give
up
my
power
over
the
company
he
make
operating
decision
pretty
much
as
i
would
have
but
when
cary
come
in
i
really
have
to
contend
with
the
fact
that
the
watson
dynasty
after
almost
six
decade
be
over
frank
be
fifty
two
therefore
he
be
likely
to
be
chief
executive
for
eight
year
and
from
my
own
experience
i
knew
that
be
more
than
enough
time
for
a
bos
to
change
a
company
forever
when
frank
start
his
new
job
i
ask
him
to
spend
a
couple
of
day
alone
with
me
at
my
ski
house
in
vermont
i
told
him
there
be
thing
i
want
to
pas
along
that
i
thought
he
might
not
know
in
spite
of
his
mba
no
textbook
in
the
world
can
tell
you
how
to
be
the
chief
executive
of
ibm
and
the
most
important
lesson
have
be
drill
into
my
head
by
dad
not
surprisingly
frank
seem
a
little
reluctant
to
go
at
first
i
m
sure
he
expect
a
bunch
of
homily
i
d
sometimes
felt
the
same
way
around
my
father
but
then
he
agree
and
in
the
middle
of
march
we
flew
up
to
stowe
the
ski
season
be
over
and
nobody
be
at
the
lodge
it
be
the
perfect
place
to
get
away
i
have
no
fix
agenda
i
simply
give
him
every
bit
of
advice
that
come
into
my
head
i
told
him
a
say
of
dad
s
about
how
the
head
of
business
should
behave
act
like
a
beggar
feel
like
a
king
the
idea
be
that
in
your
dealing
with
others
you
should
be
empathic
and
humble
yet
utterly
self
reliant
and
confident
within
frank
cary
behave
that
way
instinctively
and
this
be
my
way
of
tell
him
he
be
do
the
right
thing
i
told
him
the
real
test
of
his
leadership
would
be
whether
he
could
keep
ibm
as
immense
as
it
now
be
from
become
cold
and
impersonal
i
be
concerned
that
he
continue
to
make
the
small
gesture
that
have
be
so
important
to
me
and
dad
send
flower
to
wife
book
on
birthday
handwritten
note
to
tell
employee
that
you
recognize
and
appreciate
what
they
d
do
these
thing
aren
t
luxury
they
re
good
business
i
say
ibm
be
a
service
company
and
the
more
personal
the
tone
the
more
your
employee
and
customer
will
respond
we
cover
everything
from
the
ibm
dress
code
to
the
question
of
how
to
lobby
congress
cultivate
people
be
something
a
chief
executive
have
to
do
cultivate
not
only
politician
but
anyone
of
influence
include
newspaper
publisher
and
other
businessmen
i
told
frank
that
the
most
graceful
and
effective
way
to
do
this
be
in
person
and
that
probably
the
bad
way
be
to
have
a
washington
office
staffed
with
professional
lobbyist
the
one
area
where
i
thought
frank
might
be
weak
be
represent
ibm
to
the
outside
world
his
success
so
far
have
be
very
much
within
the
confines
of
the
company
and
i
want
him
to
realize
he
be
now
a
public
figure
i
felt
very
strongly
and
my
father
do
too
that
businessmen
have
a
responsibility
to
do
good
in
the
community
not
just
stay
in
the
office
and
coin
money
despite
a
few
lonely
night
spent
on
camp
trip
in
the
palisade
as
head
of
the
new
york
area
boy
scout
i
d
gotten
great
satisfaction
from
my
public
work
i
told
frank
that
uphold
this
tradition
of
service
be
a
key
part
of
his
job
and
i
told
him
how
to
approach
it
you
re
a
big
shot
now
i
say
you
ll
be
ask
to
join
everything
pick
two
or
three
public
organization
that
you
think
really
have
meaning
and
take
the
time
to
work
hard
on
these
you
have
to
earn
your
position
in
the
outside
world
just
like
you
earn
your
position
at
ibm
but
pretty
soon
it
become
obvious
that
frank
wasn
t
interested
in
the
national
spotlight
instead
he
join
the
board
of
a
handful
of
powerful
company
and
become
an
important
figure
in
the
business
roundtable
and
other
insider
group
i
be
disappointed
at
first
but
i
knew
frank
have
a
tough
job
to
do
run
ibm
in
not
only
my
shadow
but
the
old
man
s
and
i
come
to
accept
the
fact
that
he
be
go
to
do
it
his
own
way
try
to
make
himself
famous
be
what
any
watson
would
have
do
but
it
wasn
t
frank
cary
s
style
and
the
fact
be
that
for
eight
year
he
ran
ibm
as
well
as
it
have
ever
be
run
i
woke
in
my
bunk
to
the
heavy
sound
of
palawan
s
engine
my
watch
show
a
m
but
the
porthole
be
bright
with
daylight
it
be
august
and
we
be
cruise
the
icy
water
off
the
coast
of
greenland
more
than
five
hundred
mile
above
the
arctic
circle
in
my
heavy
pajama
and
a
coat
i
step
on
deck
where
the
temperature
be
just
below
degree
with
a
light
mist
blowing
from
the
northeast
here
and
there
i
could
make
out
the
dim
shape
of
large
iceberg
which
be
as
common
as
cloud
at
that
latitude
only
harder
to
ignore
at
the
helm
on
this
watch
be
jimmy
madden
my
friend
from
childhood
who
have
sail
in
the
arctic
once
as
a
college
boy
above
in
the
lookout
ring
at
the
crosstrees
be
nick
scheu
an
eighteen
year
old
sail
novice
i
be
glad
he
seem
alert
yacht
man
by
amateur
almost
never
venture
this
far
north
the
water
of
the
greenland
coast
be
know
for
all
sort
of
ice
from
iceberg
more
than
a
mile
long
to
large
almost
entirely
submerge
mass
of
blue
band
ice
that
be
difficult
to
spot
and
that
can
send
a
thin
hull
vessel
quickly
to
the
bottom
somewhere
ahead
lay
smith
sound
and
our
destination
the
desert
eskimo
settlement
of
etah
where
admiral
peary
in
begin
his
eight
hundred
mile
trek
to
discover
the
north
pole
this
be
the
first
major
voyage
of
the
boat
i
d
dream
of
and
then
plan
in
my
bed
at
greenwich
hospital
the
new
palawan
be
a
sturdy
blue
sixty
eight
foot
ketch
not
huge
as
yacht
go
but
the
big
boat
i
d
ever
own
and
exactly
suit
to
the
kind
of
voyage
i
have
in
mind
for
my
retirement
i
d
design
her
with
the
idea
of
be
able
to
sail
to
remote
corner
of
the
earth
in
reasonable
safety
and
comfort
with
enough
friend
to
keep
thing
interest
the
boat
be
simple
enough
for
me
to
sail
with
the
help
of
a
single
professional
if
olive
and
i
want
privacy
yet
capable
of
sustain
eight
people
at
sea
for
sixty
day
and
four
thousand
mile
when
she
be
brand
new
in
i
d
sail
her
across
the
atlantic
from
bremen
where
she
be
built
get
to
know
her
quirk
later
that
year
we
d
cruise
around
the
caribbean
and
along
the
coast
of
maine
but
those
trip
be
mere
preparation
i
d
nearly
die
i
d
step
down
from
ibm
and
i
be
look
for
an
adventure
that
those
recent
event
in
my
life
wouldn
t
totally
overshadow
i
want
to
make
a
journey
to
a
seldom
travel
place
with
real
risk
the
plan
be
to
take
the
palawan
as
far
north
as
possible
despite
the
warn
of
george
b
drake
a
marine
architect
friend
of
jimmy
madden
s
who
have
be
up
the
greenland
coast
aboard
a
cargo
ship
the
year
before
when
he
heard
we
be
planning
this
voyage
he
write
jimmy
a
letter
that
say
i
do
not
recommend
this
trip
on
a
yacht
we
found
heavy
ice
and
the
weather
deteriorates
as
you
go
north
overcast
most
of
the
time
sudden
squall
out
of
nowhere
that
last
quite
a
while
and
fog
come
in
at
odd
time
quite
different
from
the
fog
we
experience
even
off
the
coast
of
maine
the
motor
vessel
on
which
we
sail
be
a
replacement
for
one
that
be
lose
presumably
by
hit
an
iceberg
our
ship
be
on
her
second
bow
as
in
spite
of
her
have
two
radar
she
smack
an
iceberg
and
fold
in
her
original
bow
early
in
the
summer
we
d
set
out
from
camden
maine
cruise
to
newfoundland
and
then
to
greenland
across
the
davis
strait
take
a
circuitous
route
to
avoid
ice
near
labrador
s
coast
the
crew
i
d
assemble
for
this
ambitious
project
be
hardly
what
you
d
expect
for
an
arctic
expedition
a
mixture
of
young
and
old
men
and
woman
with
only
two
professional
sailor
neither
of
whom
have
any
arctic
experience
the
weather
be
frigid
overcast
and
often
foggy
and
we
chart
our
course
mainly
by
radio
navigation
instead
of
the
sun
after
a
cold
week
we
have
a
spectacular
landfall
at
godthaab
greenland
s
capital
we
be
in
dense
fog
as
we
drew
near
and
i
thought
we
d
have
to
stop
because
there
be
no
way
to
find
the
harbor
entrance
but
suddenly
the
fog
blew
away
reveal
brilliant
blue
sky
and
a
spectacular
view
of
the
town
at
the
foot
of
low
snowy
mountain
with
the
high
peak
of
the
ice
cap
in
the
distance
beyond
greenland
be
five
sixth
cover
by
ice
all
year
round
but
in
the
region
of
godthaab
in
summer
there
be
lovely
field
wildflower
and
even
a
few
small
tree
during
our
layover
in
godthaab
olive
and
one
of
our
friend
flew
up
to
join
the
crew
i
also
recruit
an
eskimo
ice
pilot
name
lars
jensen
who
have
just
graduate
from
shipmaster
school
lars
be
only
twenty
eight
year
old
but
he
d
be
at
sea
all
his
life
he
be
skeptical
about
join
the
crew
of
a
pleasure
boat
and
wouldn
t
sign
on
until
he
d
sail
with
us
a
couple
of
day
check
our
seamanship
and
make
sure
we
weren
t
go
to
treat
him
as
a
servant
lars
turn
out
to
be
a
wonderful
crewmate
he
didn
t
talk
much
but
be
extremely
competent
and
have
a
wry
sense
of
humor
that
help
in
the
tight
spot
a
few
day
after
we
left
godthaab
i
clumsily
scrap
palawan
s
centerboard
on
the
bottom
during
a
passage
through
a
shallow
strait

out
onto
the

in
alarm
but
there
be
no
sign
of
him
afterward
one
of
the
crew
told
me
that
as
the

of
aluminum
grate
on
rock
be
heard
in

lars
simply
flip
another
card
onto
the

and
proclaim
the
dangerous
water
of
greenland
we
gradually
work
our
way
up
the
coast
toward
disko

for
whaler
follow

well
than
jimmy

naval
architect
friend
have
predict
and
on
july
we
cross
the
arctic
circle
within
sight
of
spectacular
glacier
and
fjord
a
tragedy
at
home
interrupt
the
voyage
early
on
july
as
we
get
ready
to
leave
the
tiny
harbor
of
egedesminde
a
messenger
come
to
the
dock
with
a
telegram
from
my
secretary
at
ibm
my
brother
have
have
a
serious
fall
in
his
house
in
new
canaan
there
be
no
detail
about
dick
s
condition
the
telegram
simply
say
you
must
come
home
i
knew
when
i
read
it
that
dick
be
go
to
die
though
he
be
only
fifty
five
year
old
he
d
be
in
poor
health
and
be
recover
from
a
heart
attack
the
year
before
olive
and
i
be
able
to
get
a
helicopter
to
fetch
us
from
an
airport
one
hundred
fifty
mile
away
and
we
flew
from
there
to
connecticut
to
stand
by
helplessly
at
the
hospital
dick
die
a
week
later
without
ever
regain
consciousness
after
his
funeral
olive
stayed
behind
to
console
nancy
dick
s
wife
but
i
go
directly
back
to
the
boat
i
be
in
no
state
to
be
of
help
to
anybody
and
i
be
afraid
to
sit
idle
because
i
knew
my
brother
s
death
be
go
to
haunt
me
we
have
never
fully
heal
our
relationship
after
the
system
crisis
i
d
take
action
that
have
derail
dick
s
ibm
career
and
i
blame
myself
hard
feeling
have
darken
our
relationship
for
nine
year
even
though
we
be
the
son
of
a
man
who
taught
his
child
never
to
let
the
sun
set
on
a
family
argument
now
i
saw
the
terrible
wisdom
of
dad
s
belief
my
brother
have
die
and
my
feeling
be
so
tangle
that
i
didn
t
know
how
to
mourn
him
be
responsible
for
the
palawan
and
its
crew
in
that
harsh
landscape
help
me
come
to
term
gradually
with
what
have
happen
by
early
august
we
be
far
north
of
where
any
pleasure
boat
have
ever
go
i
d
compete
in
so
many
ocean
race
that
most
seagoing
condition
be
familiar
to
me
but
i
d
never
see
anything
like
what
we
now
encounter
the
sea
be
black
and
very
still
except
for
little
patch
ripple
by
wind
there
be
lot
of
bird
tern
duck
and
big
sea
bird
like
gannet
we
cruise
among
iceberg
that
in
the
light
of
the
midnight
sun
would
turn
a
translucent
blue
the
calm
be
broken
by
the
weird
sound
of
what
fisherman
call
growler
room
size
chunk
of
submerge
ice
grind
against
each
other
in
the
swell
once
in
a
while
the
palawan
would
be
rock
by
a
three
or
four
foot
wave
that
come
from
an
iceberg
roll
over
many
mile
away
our
weather
be
mostly
clear
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
crew
member
would
sit
in
the
cockpit
look
at
the
sun
an
orb
low
on
the
horizon
radiate
eerie
shade
of
red
on
the
cloud
above
the
black
sea
there
be
always
two
people
on
watch
the
rule
be
three
hour
on
six
hour
off
and
there
be
a
stand
order
to
call
me
if
anyone
saw
ice
field
or
if
the
weather
begin
to
deteriorate
if
we
have
gotten
into
trouble
help
would
have
be
a
long
way
off
and
we
surely
would
have
be
told
that
we
shouldn
t
have
be
there
in
the
first
place
the
etah
settlement
where
peary
s
expedition
begin
be
mile
ahead
but
lars
jensen
take
a
long
look
from
the
mast
and
saw
that
ice
have
completely
choked
the
passage
through
smith
sound
we
decide
to
turn
eastward
toward
the
tiny
eskimo
village
of
qanaq
perhaps
the
most
northerly
on
earth
where
he
knew
some
of
the
resident
we
inched
our
way
along
for
twelve
hour
with
palawan
s
bow
gently
nudge
aside
giant
ice
cake
as
the
sky
turn
gray
and
it
start
to
mist
finally
about
six
mile
southwest
of
qanaq
with
the
hut
of
the
town
dimly
in
view
we
ran
into
such
heavy
ice
that
the
boat
stop
lars
kept
say
i
ll
get
us
in
there
i
ll
get
us
in
but
i
thought
about
our
unshielded
propeller
only
three
foot
below
the
surface
and
our
unreinforced
hull
make
of
aluminum
only
a
quarter
inch
thick
and
decide
we
should
turn
around
the
ice
be
shift
and
for
a
while
we
could
go
neither
forward
nor
back
as
the
wind
from
the
west
become
strong
and
rain
and
sleet
pelt
us
if
a
westerly
gale
spring
up
along
the
greenland
coast
it
s
possible
to
be
pin
in
the
ice
or
beset
as
the
old
timer
say
the
ice
can
pile
up
and
easily
crush
a
boat
like
ours
i
have
vision
of
various
arctic
explorer
frozen
in
over
a
winter
vision
of
myself
try
to
explain
to
other
yachtsman
what
have
happen
to
my
beautiful
new
boat
vision
of
a
helicopter
have
to
come
rescue
us
from
thule
air
force
base
to
the
south
vision
of
deal
at
close
quarter
with
water
temperature
of
degree
all
sort
of
unpleasant
vision
of
be
consider
not
intrepid
explorer
but
foolish
troublemaker
we
carefully
back
into
well
water
and
after
three
hour
of
work
we
be
able
to
turn
around
and
make
our
way
out
to
sea
we
d
come
within
about
mile
of
the
pole
we
cruise
southward
toward
the
thule
air
base
and
the
follow
afternoon
moor
at
the
supply
dock
next
to
a
large
tanker
the
guard
on
duty
be
amaze
to
see
a
yacht
if
i
have
a
boat
like
that
i
d
be
in
the
caribbean
he
say
pretty
soon
the
base
commander
and
a
couple
of
danish
official
show
up
and
welcome
us
which
be
a
relief
because
i
hadn
t
be
sure
what
kind
of
reception
we
d
get
although
i
d
kept
the
danish
authority
aware
of
our
run
northward
i
also
never
stayed
anywhere
long
enough
to
give
them
a
chance
to
tell
us
to
turn
back
the
voyage
accomplish
what
i
d
hop
it
help
me
to
let
go
of
ibm
not
that
i
d
ever
seriously
consider
reverse
my
decision
to
retire
because
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
that
wasn
t
an
option
i
d
have
a
heart
attack
be
told
not
to
run
the
company
anymore
and
be
never
so
stupid
as
to
say
doctor
i
must
go
back
they
really
need
me
so
i
be
on
my
own
and
retirement
be
a
disconcert
prospect
because
i
wasn
t
sure
i
could
live
at
peace
with
myself
without
ibm
i
stayed
active
on
a
number
of
board
include
time
pan
american
banker
trust
the
mayo
foundation
the
smithsonian
institution
and
caltech
so
my
calendar
typically
include
a
couple
of
high
level
meeting
per
week
but
i
didn
t
like
just
be
a
director
i
felt
terribly
underutilized
and
have
to
fight
off
the
impulse
to
try
to
dominate
some
of
those
meeting
the
process
of
wean
myself
from
ibm
take
year
i
stayed
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
until
and
at
first
i
do
a
fair
amount
behind
the
scene
counsel
with
other
director
to
make
sure
ibm
be
steady
as
we
move
through
vin
learson
s
brief
tenure
and
then
help
frank
cary
get
smoothly
launch
when
i
turn
sixty
and
formally
retire
in
january
i
told
frank
i
would
not
come
into
the
building
for
one
hundred
day
have
a
former
chief
executive
hang
around
only
undermines
the
new
guy
s
authority
my
father
have
die
so
he
wasn
t
around
to
interfere
with
me
and
i
have
no
intention
of
interfere
with
cary
it
be
hard
to
do
but
one
hundred
day
pass
and
i
didn
t
show
my
face
then
i
have
to
struggle
to
get
use
to
be
a
retiree
before
my
eye
ibm
be
evolve
into
an
enterprise
far
different
from
the
one
i
have
run
it
be
already
percent
large
than
when
i
d
step
aside
as
chief
executive
with
revenue
of
eleven
billion
dollar
in
and
cary
and
his
team
be
institute
major
change
they
d
found
that
whenever
we
launch
a
new
product
our
factory
couldn
t
build
machine
fast
enough
to
satisfy
the
demand
the
entire
industry
be
accelerate
and
frank
worried
that
ibm
s
relatively
stately
pace
of
production
left
us
vulnerable
we
be
still
lose
business
to
the
plug
compatible
manufacturer
who
get
well
and
well
at
zero
in
on
customer
who
didn
t
want
to
wait
for
ibm
delivery
but
it
wasn
t
just
the
pcms
that
frank
be
worried
about
it
be
the
japanese
by
now
they
have
use
their
manufacturing
power
to
invade
the
u
s
market
for
steel
automobile
and
consumer
electronics
and
everybody
knew
that
the
computer
industry
be
next
on
their
list
frank
have
no
intention
of
let
ibm
go
the
way
of
u
s
steel
so
he
make
a
plan
to
build
vast
new
automate
plant
and
beat
japan
at
its
own
game
the
board
agree
that
this
strategy
be
sound
but
the
cost
of
the
factory
be
stagger
even
though
i
knew
that
technology
be
change
and
that
the
u
s
be
in
a
period
of
high
inflation
i
could
hardly
believe
the
bill
that
be
come
through
i
remember
ask
frank
over
and
over
the
same
question
that
my
director
have
always
ask
me
be
you
sure
you
need
all
this
have
you
gotten
competitive
bid
we
don
t
want
these
factory
to
be
lavish
you
know
the
rebuild
take
six
year
and
end
up
cost
over
ten
billion
dollar
but
it
enable
ibm
to
stave
off
japan
which
today
control
a
small
fraction
of
the
computer
market
than
it
otherwise
would
have
in
spite
of
frank
s
success
he
make
a
few
decision
that
cause
me
to
wish
i
be
still
run
the
show
in
particular
i
be
alarmed
when
he
and
his
eventual
successor
john
opel
rapidly
phase
out
the
rental
system
shift
billion
of
dollar
worth
of
business
to
outright
sale
they
do
this
partly
because
the
life
span
of
the
machine
have
gotten
quite
short
and
partly
to
free
up
capital
that
would
otherwise
have
be
tie
up
in
rental
machine
but
it
bother
me
because
rental
traditionally
have
be
crucial
to
ibm
s
success
rental
contract
wed
us
to
our
customer
give
us
a
powerful
incentive
to
keep
service
top
notch
and
make
ibm
stable
and
essentially
depressionproof
once
the
stream
of
rental
payment
dry
up
ibm
become
far
more
volatile
and
vulnerable
to
fluctuation
in
demand
i
felt
the
same
uneasiness
dad
must
have
felt
in
the
s
when
williams
and
i
insist
on
increase
ibm
s
debt
he
d
go
along
with
us
even
though
his
instinct
told
him
that
debt
be
bad
the
debate
must
have
be
a
painful
reminder
to
him
that
ibm
be
no
longer
entirely
his
business
it
be
painful
for
me
to
realize
now
that
it
be
no
longer
mine
i
probably
would
have
become
deeply
depressed
if
ibm
have
be
the
only
outlet
for
my
energy
fortunately
i
knew
not
only
how
to
sail
but
how
to
fly
aviation
be
my
early
passion
and
while
ibm
have
replace
it
at
the
center
of
my
life
my
desire
to
be
airborne
have
never
disappear
when
the
federal
aviation
administration
restore
my
unrestricted
pilot
s
license
two
year
after
my
heart
attack
my
first
present
to
myself
be
helicopter
lesson
i
wasn
t
sure
that
life
outside
of
ibm
be
go
to
be
worthwhile
but
the
idea
of
master
a
new
form
of
fly
excite
me
so
in
the
spring
of
i
enrol
at
a
helicopter
training
center
near
boston
each
day
i
d
fly
an
hour
in
the
morning
spend
a
couple
of
hour
in
bed
and
fly
another
hour
in
the
afternoon
i
fancy
myself
a
talented
pilot
but
keep
a
helicopter
steady
be
like
try
to
stand
at
attention
on
top
of
a
medicine
ball
after
about
thirty
five
hour
in
the
air
i
despair
of
ever
learn
how
i
told
the
instructor
i
think
it
s
about
time
i
give
this
whole
thing
up
not
at
all
you
can
solo
anytime
you
want
his
confidence
surprised
me
and
without
give
myself
a
chance
to
think
i
say
well
let
s
do
it
right
now
i
close
the
door
and
off
i
go
the
practice
area
be
a
forest
where
a
lumber
company
have
cut
large
swathe
for
forty
five
minute
i
flew
up
and
down
those
cut
which
be
at
least
fifty
yard
wide
but
seem
much
narrower
to
me
until
i
felt
the
beginning
of
mastery
and
a
couple
of
week
later
i
proudly
qualify
for
my
license
a
lot
of
veteran
flier
shy
away
from
helicopter
because
of
the
gruesome
way
the
early
one
use
to
crash
typically
one
rotor
blade
would
fly
off
then
the
other
and
the
pilot
would
find
himself
in
a
fragile
little
capsule
plunge
to
earth
that
prospect
terrify
me
too
so
after
careful
research
i
bought
a
bell
jet
ranger
the
helicopter
with
the
long
and
best
safety
record
well
than
most
small
plane
i
picked
up
my
fly
career
where
i
d
left
off
at
the
end
of
the
war
while
i
d
flown
several
thousand
hour
during
my
year
at
ibm
it
be
always
for
business
and
i
never
felt
that
i
be
get
enough
solo
time
or
variety
as
a
young
man
i
d
flown
every
airplane
i
could
get
my
hand
on
fifteen
different
type
during
college
and
thirty
more
during
the
war
include
bomber
fighter
transport
plane
and
even
the
big
o
biplane
that
be
still
part
of
the
army
s
inventory
aviation
in
those
day
be
very
informal
i
d
go
up
to
a
sergeant
on
the
flight
line
and
say
i
ve
read
the
tech
order
on
the
c
and
if
you
d
just
stand
behind
me
and
show
me
where
the
switch
be
i
d
like
to
fly
it
and
he
s
say
sure
major
it
always
satisfied
me
just
to
get
the
new
airplane
up
and
down
i
have
a
reputation
for
know
what
i
be
do
because
i
never
try
crazy
stunt
and
never
have
a
crack
up
fly
after
the
war
become
increasingly
technical
with
more
and
more
faa
rule
but
unlike
many
pilot
of
my
generation
i
didn
t
mind
follow
procedure
become
part
of
the
challenge
i
love
pilot
jet
which
be
the
most
technical
fly
of
all
and
after
i
get
my
helicopter
license
i
bought
a
learjet
and
become
certify
to
fly
that
as
well
i
ve
experiment
with
just
about
every
form
of
aviation
except
space
flight
i
want
to
try
a
hang
glider
at
one
point
after
a
friend
s
son
demonstrate
one
in
stowe
there
seem
to
be
no
reason
why
a
sixty
year
old
couldn
t
learn
so
i
ask
the
young
man
for
the
name
of
the
best
instructor
in
the
united
state
i
call
and
the
secretary
at
the
hang
glide
school
say
he
wasn
t
in
i
call
again
and
again
for
a
couple
of
week
but
could
never
get
hold
of
the
guy
finally
i
say
to
the
secretary
be
he
dead
she
say
yes
be
he
kill
by
a
hang
glider
yes
that
be
the
end
of
hang
glide
for
me
it
s
quite
a
challenge
to
be
able
to
shift
from
one
type
of
fly
machine
to
another
and
not
necessarily
the
safest
thing
in
the
world
in
spite
of
my
best
effort
i
occasionally
have
a
close
call
a
lot
of
people
who
knew
me
must
have
be
say
that
old
bird
be
go
to
kill
himself
in
an
airplane
but
fly
be
vital
to
me
and
in
the
first
five
year
of
my
retirement
i
log
two
thousand
hour
not
much
less
than
the
average
corporate
pilot
i
found
that
it
sharpen
me
to
take
new
challenge
and
i
be
constantly
try
to
program
my
time
so
i
stayed
a
little
overcommitted
that
be
how
i
d
live
at
ibm
and
my
bad
fear
in
retirement
be
of
be
dead
in
the
water
in
the
summer
of
jimmy
carter
s
first
year
as
president
i
be
sit
in
my
study
at
north
haven
make
plan
for
a
voyage
around
cape
horn
when
the
phone
rang
it
be
harold
brown
the
new
secretary
of
defense
cy
and
i
think
you
ought
to
come
to
washington
and
get
busy
he
say
refer
to
secretary
of
state
cyrus
vance
brown
and
vance
have
both
be
director
of
ibm
when
i
retire
and
knew
me
well
harold
i
say
i
m
sit
in
a
comfortable
chair
look
out
a
picture
window
at
beautiful
spruce
tree
and
penobscot
bay
why
would
i
want
to
come
to
washington
president
carter
want
you
to
be
chairman
of
the
general
advisory
committee
on
arm
control
and
disarmament
i
d
never
heard
of
this
group
before
but
harold
explain
that
it
be
a
blue
ribbon
commission
whose
purpose
be
to
give
the
president
independent
advice
on
nuclear
strategy
it
be
establish
when
kennedy
be
in
the
white
house
report
directly
to
the
president
and
be
a
way
for
prominent
citizen
to
get
behind
the
curtain
of
military
secrecy
and
understand
what
be
really
go
on
in
the
arm
race
brown
and
vance
thought
i
be
an
obvious
choice
to
lead
the
gac
as
it
be
call
i
be
a
liberal
whose
whole
professional
life
involve
high
technology
and
i
d
spent
enough
time
in
russia
first
as
a
military
man
and
later
as
a
businessman
that
the
soviet
way
of
think
be
not
a
total
mystery
to
me
i
saw
the
soviet
as
responsible
people
as
interested
as
we
be
in
prevent
world
war
iii
so
that
negotiate
arm
reduction
treaty
with
them
make
sense
surprising
myself
a
little
i
jumped
at
the
opportunity
before
my
heart
attack
i
d
always
turn
down
offer
from
washington
it
never
seem
right
to
leave
ibm
and
i
wasn
t
willing
to
risk
make
a
fool
of
myself
in
some
new
area
where
i
didn
t
know
the
rope
but
now
i
be
retire
and
i
d
be
have
adventure
for
several
year
here
be
a
democratic
administration
the
first
in
a
long
time
give
me
a
chance
to
do
something
important
like
many
american
i
hadn
t
give
much
thought
to
world
war
iii
since
the
early
s
i
remember
those
terrify
day
when
everybody
huddle
by
their
radio
and
tv
set
wait
for
news
about
the
cuban
missile
crisis
i
d
built
a
fallout
shelter
for
my
own
family
during
that
period
and
have
start
a
family
shelter
loan
program
at
ibm
so
that
any
employee
who
want
a
shelter
could
afford
one
but
as
more
and
more
people
built
shelter
the
less
and
less
sense
it
seem
to
make
you
would
stay
in
your
shelter
for
thirty
day
but
when
you
come
out
what
would
you
meet
a
savage
world
with
a
lot
of
predatory
people
to
threaten
your
family
we
all
equip
our
shelter
with
pistol
and
rifle
but
the
whole
thing
begin
to
seem
insane
soon
people
seem
to
decide
that
if
nuclear
war
ever
happen
there
would
be
no
point
in
try
to
survive
when
harold
brown
call
i
hadn
t
be
downstairs
to
replenish
the
supply
in
my
shelter
for
many
year
psychologically
it
have
be
easy
to
push
out
of
my
mind
the
danger
of
the
arm
race
even
while
i
knew
it
be
still
go
on
and
ibm
be
supply
computer
for
weapon
lab
the
race
have
go
through
several
round
of
escalation
the
u
s
have
built
a
whole
new
generation
of
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
call
minuteman
we
d
surround
the
soviet
union
with
polaris
submarine
we
d
add
multiple
warhead
to
all
our
missile
and
of
course
the
russian
have
match
every
move
the
arm
control
effort
which
lag
far
behind
now
seem
to
be
near
a
crisis
the
first
salt
treaty
limit
nuclear
missile
have
lapse
salt
ii
be
still
on
the
negotiate
table
and
meanwhile
the
u
s
and
russia
be
on
the
verge
of
another
escalation
of
the
arm
race
i
put
away
my
chart
of
patagonia
for
the
next
six
month
lead
up
to
the
first
meeting
of
the
gac
i
shuttle
back
and
forth
to
washington
and
learn
everything
i
could
about
treaty
politics
and
nuclear
weapon
i
be
briefed
by
the
arm
control
and
disarmament
agency
the
state
department
the
cia
the
defense
department
s
internal
security
agency
and
the
office
of
the
joint
chief
of
staff
i
spent
hour
listen
to
military
analyst
talk
in
hypothetical
term
about
attack
counterattack
and
ten
and
hundred
of
million
of
casualty
it
be
stagger
these
people
use
a
form
of
jargon
that
make
it
possible
to
discus
nuclear
holocaust
for
hour
without
ever
mention
a
human
death
i
thought
their
whole
way
of
look
at
thing
be
perverse
i
felt
intimidate
by
the
sheer
volume
of
information
that
i
have
to
master
but
at
the
same
time
that
i
struggle
to
assimilate
the
technical
content
of
what
i
be
hearing
i
be
determine
not
to
let
the
true
meaning
escape
me
it
seem
to
me
that
we
ought
not
to
be
make
preparation
to
destroy
civilization
i
guess
the
military
would
argue
that
if
we
be
always
prepared
it
will
never
happen
but
that
concept
be
drive
the
arm
race
i
be
sure
the
expert
who
spent
their
life
immerse
in
the
intricacy
of
strategic
planning
would
consider
my
point
of
view
simplistic
so
i
try
to
keep
it
to
myself
but
use
plain
common
sense
be
the
whole
premise
for
an
advisory
board
like
the
gac
in
any
technology
field
especially
one
as
dangerous
as
this
you
need
to
counterbalance
the
narrow
focus
of
the
expert
the
white
house
didn
t
ask
my
advice
on
whom
to
appoint
to
the
gac
the

about
forty
year
old
with
a
huge
briefcase
and
so
energetic
that
he
often
fail
to
organize
his
idea
or
express
them
succinctly
not
exactly
the
ibm
style
but
he
have
brass
and
great
political
instinct
so
i
turn
off
my
ibm
approach
and
do
thing
his
way
jackson
have
me
make
courtesy
call
on
everybody
from
liberal
like
frank
church
to
hard
liner
like
scoop
jackson
i
also
make
a
point
of
seek
advice
from
veteran
of
u
s
soviet
relation
such
as
averell
harriman
and
john
j
mccloy
who
have
be
the
found
chairman
of
my
committee
in
i
didn
t
know
how
to
politick
but
i
begin
to
realize
that
in
some
way
it
isn
t
much
different
from
be
a
salesman
rule
of
thumb
that
i
d
learn
sell
punch
card
machine
also
work
here
such
as
never
waste
a
customer
s
time
and
always
make
friend
with
the
secretary
the
committee
have
so
much
ground
to
cover
that
bill
jackson
and
i
decide
it
should
meet
each
month
for
a
full
two
day
that
be
a
lot
of
time
to
ask
of
volunteer
and
i
measure
my
success
by
the
number
of
people
who
show
up
at
each
meeting
i
d
send
out
teaser
say
for
example
that
four
physicist
who
d
help
design
the
first
atom
bomb
be
come
to
talk
to
us
we
always
get
ten
or
eleven
attendee
out
of
a
possible
thirteen
which
indicate
that
people
be
interested
each
meeting
be
a
challenge
for
me
because
i
d
be
on
the
sideline
for
seven
year
and
there
be
enough
expert
on
the
committee
that
i
felt
i
could
ruin
my
credibility
by
make
two
or
three
really
stupid
remark
before
each
meeting
jackson
and
i
would
meet
in
a
hotel
and
he
d
spend
a
whole
day
throw
question
at
me
when
the
meeting
begin
i
d
have
detailed
note
to
keep
me
go
and
keep
the
pace
fast
i
never
concentrate
so
hard
in
my
life
run
the
gac
be
not
at
all
like
run
ibm
toward
the
end
of
my
career
i
have
a
well
deserve
reputation
for
swarm
all
over
people
at
meeting
but
this
be
an
advisory
panel
not
a
team
of
ibm
executive
and
my
job
be
to
develop
a
consensus
so
i
be
constantly
hold
myself
back
i
d
sit
in
those
briefing
and
write
note
to
myself
that
say
don
t
talk
too
much
make
sure
everybody
have
a
chance
to
speak
ask
for
idea
from
those
who
haven
t
say
anything
yet
my
goal
be
to
take
that
diverse
group
and
somehow
weld
it
into
a
team
i
knew
it
be
hard
for
layman
not
to
feel
intimidate
by
someone
as
brilliant
and
experienced
as
mcgeorge
bundy
who
be
at
kennedy
s
side
during
the
cuban
missile
crisis
so
i
make
it
clear
to
the
professional
that
they
d
have
to
let
other
committee
member
catch
up
in
the
meantime
i
thought
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
confront
the
professional
with
a
radically
different
viewpoint
on
the
bomb
so
i
set
up
a
private
screen
for
the
committee
of
stanley
kubrick
s
brilliant
satire
dr
strangelove
when
brent
scowcroft
one
of
the
top
military
strategist
in
the
country
heard
that
the
film
might
be
show
to
the
committee
he
say
how
can
you
show
such
an
unrealistic
picture
to
people
who
be
seriously
try
to
understand
nuclear
weapon
i
admit
that
the
scene
of
the
pilot
rid
the
h
bomb
and
wear
his
cowboy
hat
be
a
little
farfetched
but
i
thought
there
be
a
ring
of
truth
to
the
rest
of
the
movie
all
those
safeguard
go
wrong
it
make
the
point
that
the
people
with
their
finger
on
the
trigger
be
human
and
that
accident
can
happen
the
gac
usually
met
at
the
state
department
in
a
secure
conference
room
with
a
big
oval
table
brown
panel
green
carpet
and
fluorescent
light
when
the
high
level
briefing
on
weapon
begin
the
first
reaction
of
people
like
arthur
krim
and
bert
comb
and
margaret
wilson
be
emotional
there
would
be
a
coffee
break
in
the
middle
of
a
defense
department
presentation
on
cruise
missile
or
the
neutron
bomb
and
committee
member
would
come
up
to
me
glassy
eyed
and
say
can
you
imagine
the
position
these
people
have
work
us
into
we
re
pay
tax
and
they
ve
get
us
in
a
scenario
where
everybody
dy
nobody
on
the
committee
be
for
unilateral
or
total
disarmament
however
most
of
us
simply
want
to
find
way
to
make
the
standoff
with
the
russian
a
lot
less
tense
and
cut
down
the
arsenal
on
both
side
before
long
the
real
thinker
in
the
group
begin
to
emerge
wolfgang
panofsky
point
out
a
frighten
paradox
in
arm
control
technology
move
faster
than
the
treaty
make
process
so
that
we
be
perpetually
make
treaty
about
obsolete
weapon
while
race
to
build
modern
one
arthur
krim
one
of
the
most
farsighted
men
i
ve
ever
met
suggest
that
it
be
fallacy
to
think
that
we
could
invent
weapon
that
the
russian
couldn
t
somehow
match
again
and
again
the
u
s
have
escalate
the
arm
race
think
we
be
pull
decisively
ahead
only
to
have
the
russian
catch
up
a
few
year
later
this
make
sense
to
me
because
the
computer
industry
be
also
a
game
of
technological
leapfrog
only
nonlethal
i
didn
t
think
the
committee
could
function
intelligently
unless
we
saw
the
weapon
for
ourselves
so
jackson
and
i
take
the
group
to
new
mexico
where
we
visit
los
alamo
the
birthplace
of
the
atom
bomb
and
the
sandia
national
laboratory
in
albuquerque
which
be
run
by
at
t
and
be
where
bomb
component
be
developed
today
we
saw
a
department
of
energy
historical
exhibit
that
include
full
size
replica
of
little
boy
the
bomb
drop
on
hiroshima
and
fat
man
the
one
drop
on
nagasaki
then
we
go
to
a
sort
of
warehouse
at
sandia
where
we
sat
as
a
variety
of
nuclear
weapon
be
roll
out
on
silent
rubber
tire
dolly
for
us
to
see
the
technician
push
these
dolly
be
clothed
like
ibmers
in
dark
gray
suit
white
shirt
and
dark
shoe
the
bomb
themselves
be
little
modern
thing
cylinder
maybe
six
foot
long
but
some
of
them
be
ten
or
hundred
of
time
more
powerful
than
the
fat
man
upstairs
i
ll
never
forget
one
weapon
call
the
dial
a
yield
why
you
would
want
to
adjust
the
explosion
of
a
nuclear
weapon
i
don
t
know
nor
how
you
would
find
the
time
or
inclination
to
do
it
in
the
middle
of
a
nuclear
war
but
some
engineer
in
an
effort
to
be
logical
have
probably
say
well
we
don
t
just
want
to
blow
everything
to
kingdom
come
let
s
design
a
dial
a
yield
if
we
dial
it
down
it
will
only
do
so
much
and
if
we
dial
it
up
it
ll
do
so
much
more
the
whole
committee
be
brought
up
short
by
see
such
thing
even
lane
kirkland
and
the
other
hard
liner
when
you
sit
across
a
room
from
a
nuclear
weapon
you
can
t
help
but
feel
afraid
of
the
future
after
hearing
dozen
of
presentation
by
high
rank
officer
many
of
us
come
to
the
conclusion
that
military
men
aren
t
capable
of
imagine
nuclear
war
as
a
rational
civilian
might
they
talk
about
it
they
make
plan
for
it
and
yet
they
avoid
think
about
what
would
really
happen
in
nuclear
war
the
people
on
our
committee
would
ask
what
do
you
think
the
survival
rate
of
the
united
state
might
be
some
estimate
be
as
low
as
percent
and
some
as
high
as
percent
when
we
question
whether
there
would
be
an
america
left
that
resemble
the
one
we
live
in
now
the
answer
would
be
well
we
could
breed
the
race
back
from
there
i
thought
our
first
report
to
carter
ought
to
be
unanimous
but
there
be
such
a
range
of
opinion
on
the
committee
that
this
be
no
easy
feat
most
member
be
in
favor
of
reverse
the
arm
race
through
treaty
lane
kirkland
on
the
other
hand
be
always
puff
out
black
smoke
treaty
with
those
bastard
aren
t
worth
a
damn
he
d
say
he
be
pretty
close
to
scoop
jackson
a
senior
member
of
the
senate
arm
service
committee
and
thought
the
u
s
should
simply
arm
up
and
stand
firm
harold
agnew
the
director
of
the
los
alamo
lab
be
a
kind
of
gadfly
full
of
criticism
but
impossible
to
pin
down
he
d
sit
quietly
through
a
meeting
suddenly
make
a
caustic
remark
about
an
idea
we
be
work
on
and
then
go
back
in
his
shell
scowcroft
be
hard
to
read
too
although
he
be
brilliant
and
the
clearest
mind
military
man
i
ever
met
there
be
plenty
of
issue
on
which
we
all
disagreed
but
we
finally
found
a
common
cause
when
the
air
force
show
up
to
present
its
proposal
for
the
new
mx
missile
which
amount
to
yet
another
escalation
of
the
arm
race
they
want
to
dig
thousand
of
silo
in
the
desert
and
move
the
rocket
around
so
they
d
be
hard
for
the
russian
to
attack
out
of
every
twenty
silo
only
one
would
have
a
real
missile
and
the
rest
would
be
decoy
the
cost
of
this
giant
shell
game
be
go
to
be
something
like
fifty
billion
dollar
to
cover
three
hundred
new
mx
with
ten
warhead
each
hundred
of
giant
tractor
to
haul
them
around
fifty
seven
hundred
dummy
rocket
and
six
thousand
silo
we
heard
briefing
on
the
mx
throughout
the
summer
of
the
state
department
be
against
it
and
the
cia
sent
a
man
to
tell
us
how
ridiculous
the
propose
base
scheme
be
we
know
a
little
bit
about
deception
he
say
and
those
decoy
aren
t
go
to
fool
anybody
for
every
criticism
that
be
make
the
air
force
would
come
back
with
some
new
improvisation
i
would
never
have
tolerate
such
half
bake
think
at
ibm
and
the
rest
of
the
gac
felt
the
same
way
at
the
end
of
september
we
report
to
the
president
that
the
mx
scheme
be
impractical
and
should
not
be
pursue
i
think
carter
have
already
reach
the
same
conclusion
he
kept
the
plan
around
as
a
bargaining
chip
but
as
long
as
he
be
in
the
white
house
the
new
missile
be
never
built
carter
seem
to
find
our
work
useful
and
late
in
he
ask
us
to
come
up
with
idea
for
new
reduction
of
nuclear
arm
even
though
salt
ii
hadn
t
yet
be
sign
and
be
also
go
to
face
a
tough
battle
for
approval
in
the
senate
he
be
look
forward
to
salt
iii
critic
of
the
administration
would
have
dismiss
this
as
typical
carter
idealism
but
to
me
he
seem
to
be
act
from
a
realistic
sense
of
how
dangerous
the
nuclear
arsenal
be
and
how
technological
advance
make
agreement
obsolete
we
give
him
a
long
list
of
proposal
such
as
the
phase
out
of
rocket
with
multiple
warhead
but
our
most
important
point
be
that
the
treaty
make
process
be
too
slow
it
have
take
three
administration
six
year
to
work
out
salt
ii
meanwhile
weapon
laboratory
have
give
the
world
new
generation
of
missile
bomber
and
the
neutron
bomb
we
told
carter
that
the
only
answer
be
for
the
head
of
both
country
to
streamline
arm
negotiation
by
take
an
active
continuous
and
direct
role
themselves
by
the
spring
of
the
gac
have
branch
out
into
many
other
project
panofsky
write
a
highly
classify
study
for
the
white
house
on
the
future
of
icbm
and
arthur
krim
begin
agitate
among
prominent
democrat
for
a
treaty
ban
all
new
weapon
our
meeting
become
an
important
arm
control
forum
and
we
heard
from
prominent
people
all
across
the
ideological
spectrum
hawk
like
fred
ikl
and
advocate
of
d
tente
like
averell
harriman
and
the
state
department
s
marshall
shulman
all
of
this
be
do
without
a
single
leak
to
the
press
which
be
one
reason
so
many
people
be
willing
to
talk
to
us
another
reason
be
that
we
be
know
to
have
carter
s
ear
when
stansfield
turner
the
director
of
the
cia
want
to
alert
the
president
that
the
united
state
be
down
to
only
one
spare
spy
satellite
he
come
to
the
gac
to
make
his
case
even
the
russian
notice
that
we
be
around
in
march
i
get
an
invitation
which
i
decline
to
visit
moscow
and
discus
the
future
of
arm
control
at
a
soviet
foreign
policy
institute
carter
seem
to
share
our
faith
in
personal
leadership
when
he
go
to
the
vienna
summit
conference
to
sign
salt
ii
the
follow
june
he
make
a
set
of
dramatic
proposal
to
leonid
brezhnev
on
speed
up
salt
iii
he
give
the
premier
a
handwritten
list
of
major
arm
cut
both
country
might
pursue
and
told
brezhnev
that
the
united
state
would
be
willing
to
put
into
effect
each
element
of
the
next
treaty
as
it
be
agree
on
instead
of
wait
for
the
entire
package
this
must
have
give
the
russian
a
lot
to
think
about
but
we
never
have
a
chance
to
learn
their
response
instead
increase
tension
between
our
country
and
senate
objection
to
salt
cause
the
whole
treaty
make
process
to
collapse
i
like
run
the
gac
and
would
gladly
have
stayed
with
it
for
the
rest
of
the
carter
administration
olive
be
pleased
with
the
effect
the
job
have
on
me
she
say
it
make
me
happier
and
easy
to
live
with
than
anything
i
d
do
since
leave
ibm
but
in
may
a
report
appear
in
the
new
york
time
that
malcolm
toon
the
u
s
ambassador
to
moscow
be
about
to
retire
and
that
averell
harriman
be
advocate
me
as
his
replacement
olive
spot
it
first
and
get
very
upset
what
s
this
about
us
go
to
russia
she
say
the
thought
of
have
to
move
to
a
foreign
country
and
be
separate
from
our
child
and
grandchild
be
really
alarm
to
her
let
me
see
that
i
say
that
s
ridiculous
we
re
not
go
to
moscow
nobody
s
mention
it
to
me
a
couple
of
day
later
vance
call
and
say
i
be
indeed
go
to
be
carter
s
choice
it
turn
out
that
the
administration
have
the
idea
that
i
could
make
thing
go
more
smoothly
in
moscow
toon
the
current
ambassador
be
a
holdover
from
the
ford
administration
and
an
advocate
of
toughness
toward
the
soviet
i
d
met
him
when
i
be
get
ready
to
run
the
gac
and
thought
he
have
an
odd
abrasive
style
when
he
talk
about
russia
he
usually
have
reasonable
idea
but
he
d
lead
off
with
a
hostile
aside
like
well
of
course
i
hate
the
son
of
bitch
he
be
critical
of
salt
ii
and
skeptical
about
the
future
of
d
tente
the
russian
didn
t
like
him
and
carter
want
me
to
take
his
place
as
flatter
as
the
offer
be
i
have
no
diplomatic
experience
and
knew
i
d
again
be
go
in
over
my
head
furthermore
i
didn
t
disagree
with
toon
that
much
on
the
basic
issue
although
i
be
less
inclined
to
be
polemical
there
be
another
factor
as
well
i
wasn
t
sure
i
be
be
fair
to
olive
she
be
really
downcast
the
more
she
heard
about
moscow
the
less
she
like
the
idea
although
she
perked
up
a
bit
when
gay
vance
call
and
told
all
about
spaso
house
the
magnificent
ambassador
s
residence
say
how
easy
it
would
be
for
us
to
have
friend
and
grandchild
come
visit
olive
and
i
discuss
the
matter
a
great
deal
and
i
finally
say
i
want
to
go
ahead
i
really
be
hop
to
advance
u
s
soviet
relation
and
arm
control
and
i
told
olive
that
would
be
the
best
thing
for
the
grandchild
ours
and
everybody
else
s
long
before
my
appointment
be
make
official
i
found
myself
the
object
of
a
big
controversy
a
lot
of
foreign
policy
expert
thought
that
i
be
the
wrong
choice
that
the
moscow
job
call
for
a
veteran
russian
speak
diplomat
like
toon
instead
of
an
amateur
with
good
intention
moscow
be
generally
see
as
one
of
the
most
demand
diplomatic
post
and
for
thirty
year
it
have
be
fill
by
professional
there
be
report
that
powerful
member
of
the
senate
foreign
relation
committee
be
go
to
challenge
my
appointment
if
carter
go
through
with
it
some
critic
didn
t
know
i
have
experience
in
arm
control
they
thought
carter
have
suddenly
go
soft
on
russia
and
be
send
the
chairman
of
ibm
to
throw
open
the
gate
of
trade
between
our
two
country
my
proponent
try
to
counteract
all
this
with
a
lobbying
campaign
they
publicize
my
work
on
the
gac
and
my
various
trip
to
moscow
and
suggest
that
i
belong
in
the
great
tradition
of
business
statesman
like
harriman
who
have
be
our
moscow
ambassador
during
the
war
thing
be
look
very
promising
although
while
all
this
be
go
on
i
make
an
embarrass
mistake
in
july
just
before
my
appointment
be
to
be
officially
announce
i
attend
the
vienna
summit
conference
as
chairman
of
the
gac
with
carter
i
get
a
call
in
my
hotel
from
a
newspaper
reporter
i
knew
slightly
he
say
i
m
down
in
the
lobby
with
a
colleague
of
mine
and
we
want
to
talk
to
you
about
your
nomination
for
the
ambassadorship
i
haven
t
heard
that
i
ve
be
officially
appoint
i
say
so
i
don
t
think
i
be
in
a
position
to
say
anything
well
how
about
let
us
come
up
and
talk
to
you
for
background
oh
i
don
t
mind
that
i
say
i
want
to
be
friendly
but
wasn
t
think
very
clearly
the
gac
have
avoid
publicity
completely
and
for
year
at
ibm
we
d
be
very
careful
in
our
dealing
with
the
press
the
interview
last
fifteen
minute
go
very
well
and
the
reporter
agree
to
put
it
down
only
as
background
then
just
as
they
be
get
ready
to
leave
one
of
them
say
what
s
that
on
your
thumb
as
it
happen
i
be
go
to
the
opera
that
night
and
i
want
to
remind
myself
to
look
for
ambassador
toon
there
so
i
have
write
on
my
thumb
in
small
letter
t
o
o
n
oh
that
i
say
my
young
daughter
do
the
same
thing
she
call
it
scratch
memory
i
m
go
to
the
opera
tonight
and
i
want
to
make
sure
i
look
for
ambassador
toon
i
could
never
find
out
which
of
the
two
reporter
spread
the
story
around
but
pretty
soon
an
article
come
out
that
i
be
an
old
man
with
a
lousy
memory
i
didn
t
think
the
story
be
devastate
just
annoy
but
when
i
get
back
to
washington
marshall
shulman
call
me
in
he
be
the
top
state
department
authority
on
u
s
soviet
relation
and
one
of
the
people
drum
up
senate
support
for
my
appointment
he
say
that
article
be
really
go
to
hurt
your
chance
you
ve
get
to
be
kid
i
say
i
could
have
a
smudge
on
my
nose
someday
and
someone
could
write
about
that
if
that
s
go
to
make
or
break
me
as
ambassador
i
m
in
the
wrong
game
i
come
on
strong
because
i
didn
t
want
to
admit
how
naive
i
d
be
to
talk
to
those
two
reporter
shulman
didn
t
back
down
an
inch
he
told
me
off
and
i
be
quite
relieve
when
my
appointment
finally
go
through
when
i
left
the
gac
arthur
krim
and
his
wife
mathilde
give
me
a
party
in
their
magnificent
townhouse
in
new
york
mac
bundy
make
the
send
off
speech
and
present
me
with
a
set
of
colonial
pewter
spoon
on
behalf
of
the
group
i
ll
never
forget
the
funny
thing
he
say
when
you
look
at
these
spoon
tom
you
ll
notice
that
they
be
too
long
to
use
at
a
banquet
with
friend
and
too
short
to
sup
with
the
devil
so
perhaps
they
ll
be
just
the
right
length
for
you
to
use
in
moscow
and
be
remind
of
the
great
affection
in
which
everyone
in
this
room
hold
you
it
be
the
nice
send
off
i
could
have
have
there
be
already
sign
of
the
come
winter
when
we
arrive
in
moscow
in
october
the
city
s
dingy
building
and
grim
sky
remind
me
of
the
four
month
i
d
spent
in
russia
as
a
young
pilot
and
aide
to
general
follett
bradley
during
the
war
while
i
have
no
affection
whatsoever
for
the
communist
system
the
experience
of
russia
in
wartime
have
left
a
deep
impression
on
me
on
the
bradley
mission
we
d
work
in
the
old
u
s
chancellery
on
mokhavaya
street
right
across
from
the
kremlin
with
the
german
army
less
than
thirty
mile
away
we
d
flown
across
the
vast
outer
province
and
gotten
stuck
for
a
week
in
the
middle
of
siberia
turn
back
hitler
s
invasion
be
one
of
the
great
triumph
of
soviet
history
and
i
be
proud
to
have
witness
it
and
to
a
small
degree
participate
but
i
didn
t
fool
myself
into
think
that
nostalgia
be
go
to
make
me
an
effective
ambassador
even
though
i
felt
connect
to
russia
because
of
the
war
i
be
quite
aware
of
the
reality
of
u
s
soviet
affair
in
d
tente
be
work
poorly
and
the
signing
of
salt
ii
have
be
the
only
positive
development
in
a
long
time
my
mission
from
carter
and
vance
be
clear
cut
they
want
me
to
right
the
tremendous
imbalance
that
have
developed
between
the
treatment
of
the
american
ambassador
in
moscow
and
the
treatment
of
ambassador
anatoly
dobrynin
in
washington
dobrynin
have
be
the
soviet
envoy
in
america
for
twenty
year
and
be
so
well
establish
that
he
could
get
to
see
the
president
just
by
pick
up
the
phone
he
be
even
allow
to
park
in
the
state
department
garage
our
ambassador
by
contrast
have
have
little
access
to
the
kremlin
for
more
than
ten
year
during
the
salt
negotiation
the
carter
administration
have
do
the
expedient
thing
and
use
dobrynin
to
convey
its
think
to
moscow
shunt
malcolm
toon
aside
but
now
that
the
treaty
be
sign
carter
want
the
prestige
of
the
american
embassy
restore
i
have
yet
to
learn
the
nut
and
bolt
of
my
new
job
but
i
already
knew
what
sort
of
ambassador
i
want
to
be
my
ambition
be
to
model
myself
after
my
good
friend
llewellyn
thompson
the
ambassador
to
moscow
under
president
eisenhower
kennedy
and
johnson
i
d
met
thompson
in
moscow
in
when
he
be
a
junior
diplomat
most
of
the
embassy
staff
have
be
sent
to
the
town
of
kuybyshev
five
hundred
mile
to
the
rear
but
tommy
as
he
be
call
have
be
assign
to
keep
an
eye
on
our
moscow
facility
one
of
my
first
task
have
be
to
fly
him
all
the
way
to
teheran
to
pick
up
provision
for
the
staff
because
all
over
russia
food
be
scarce
we
load
the
bomb
bay
with
two
ton
of
supply
not
fancy
food
like
you
d
expect
for
an
embassy
but
wartime
staple
such
as
klim
a
kind
of
condense
milk
and
bean
in
can
i
come
to
know
tommy
well
and
look
up
to
him
the
way
a
young
man
admires
someone
ten
year
old
he
be
a
tall
slim
fellow
fluent
in
russian
naturally
a
bit
shy
and
reserve
but
he
didn
t
let
that
stop
him
as
ambassador
he
travel
all
over
russia
and
rubbed
elbow
socially
with
high
rank
soviet
almost
every
day
he
and
his
wife
knew
how
to
create
a
warm
ambiance
and
make
spaso
house
his
official
residence
a
magnet
for
hundred
of
important
soviet
from
politburo
member
to
ballerina
it
be
one
of
the
few
decadent
place
where
high
rank
soviet
could
openly
go
nikita
khrushchev
like
tommy
so
much
that
they
use
to
talk
together
for
hour

thompson
wasn
t
a
brilliant
theorist
like
george
kennan
but
he
understood
soviet
motivation
and
in
that
knowledge
may
have
help
save
everybody
s
life
at
the
peak
of
the
cuban
missile
crisis
khrushchev
sent
kennedy
two
conflict
message
the
first
be
conciliatory
and
make
it
clear
that
the
premier
want
to
avoid
nuclear
war
the
second
be
belligerent
and
almost
dare
kennedy
to
take
the
confrontation
another
step
kennedy
and
his
men
be
baffle
until
thompson
advise
that
the
first
message
be
probably
closer
to
what
khrushchev
felt
and
that
the
russian
be
worried
not
so
much
about
put
missile
in
cuba
as
about
obtain
a
bargaining
position
on
other
matter
on
that
basis
bobby
kennedy
come
up
with
an
astonishingly
simple
idea
ignore
the
second
message
and
answer
only
the
first
with
an
offer
to
try
to
build
d
tente
between
east
and
west
if
the
missile
be
remove
that
s
what

as

back
on
my
visit
with

first
morning
reception
of

i
have
to
admit
that
the
watson
love
of
be
a
celebrity
hasn
t
entirely
pass
me
by
there
be
over
one
hundred
american
on
the

all
read
those
newspaper
story
about
my
have
to
write
toon
s
name
on
my
thumb
and
i
knew
they
must
be
wonder
what
they
be
get
i
met
the
issue
of
my
inexperience
head
on
i
call
a
general
meeting
and
after
explain
my
work
on
the
gac
that
have
lead
to
the
ambassadorship
i
put
myself
in
their
hand
ambassador
toon
make
the
point
many
time
that
this
post
need
professional
leadership
i
say
obviously
i
m
not
a
professional
and
that
mean
i
be
grateful
for
your
competence
add
a
little
ibm
touch
i
say
that
the
door
to
my
office
would
always
be
open
to
anyone
with
problem
suggestion
or
new
idea
they
seem
to
respond
to
that
and
also
to
my
mission
of
restore
the
embassy
s
prestige
it
help
that
there
be
a
big
difference
between
toon
s
style
and
mine
his
be
more
aloof
i
concentrate
on
the
same
thing
i
would
have
at
ibm
cultivate
loyalty
and
boost
morale
the
follow
week
olive
and
i
have
a
reception
for
all
the
embassy
personnel
and
their
family
and
it
be
the
first
time
many
of
them
have
see
the
inside
of
spaso
house
the
soviet
for
their
part
seem
happy
to
see
a
new
face
my
first
visit
be
with
foreign
minister
andrei
gromyko
whom
i
originally
met
in
when
khrushchev
tour
the
ibm
plant
in
those
day
russian
official
be
know
for
wear
badly
cut
suit
and
i
remember
how
gromyko
have
stood
out
because
he
be
well
dress
a
man
of
deep
intellect
and
impeccable
manner
he
have
gradually
taught
his
comrade
the
way
diplomat
ought
to
act
his
nickname
at
the
state
department
be
old
stoneface
but
i
thought
of
him
as
a
great
actor
he
be
impassive
only
when
it
suit
his
purpose
at
other
time
he
d
become
interested
in
something
you
say
and
you
could
watch
a
half
dozen
different
expression
cross
his
face
when
i
saw
him
officially
in
moscow
the
routine
be
always
the
same
i
d
call
to
make
an
appointment
one
day
s
notice
be
usually
enough
and
we
d
meet
at
the
foreign
ministry
in
a
little
conference
room
next
to
his
office
he
d
come
in
we
d
each
take
a
glass
of
mineral
water
and
we
d
talk
about
arrange
exit
visa
for
jew
get
on
with
permission
to
build
our
new
chancellery
speed
up
action
on
salt
ii
in
the
u
s
senate
or
whatever
our
business
be
that
day
my
first
hope
of
a
diplomatic
success
come
during
a
meeting
with
brezhnev
s
assistant
aleksandrov
he
be
tell
me
how
fondly
they
remember
tommy
thompson
and
i
take
the
opportunity
to
remind
him
that
unlike
recent
ambassador
thompson
have
be
give
full
access
to
the
politburo
that
be
a
goal
of
mine
i
say
i
d
like
to
chat
with
each
member
of
the
politburo
if
i
succeed
in
that
i
will
have
do
some
good
for
my
country
and
maybe
for
your
country
and
i
will
also
be
show
my
bos
cy
vance
that
i
be
active
here
not
just
sit
around
reading
tolstoy
aleksandrov
be
a
little
man
with
a
loud
voice
he
laugh
and
say
personally
i
think
that
would
be
an
excellent
idea
it
be
unclear
whether
anyone
else
would
but
to
mark
garrison
our
embassy
s
deputy
chief
of
mission
the
fact
that
i
get
even
that
far
without
a
rebuff
be
intrigue
garrison
be
a
sovietologist
and
career
foreign
service
officer
a
remarkably
level
head
man
with
whom
i
become
good
friend
i
think
he
be
simultaneously
curious
and
skeptical
about
my
chance
but
he
coached
me
patiently
in
the
basic
of
be
an
ambassador
and
i
rely
on
him
heavily
just
as
i
d
depend
on
bill
jackson
at
the
gac
my
other
coach
be
robert
german
our
political
counselor
who
be
constantly
by
my
side
as
i
move
in
official
circle
bob
be
a
soft
spoken
texan
a
lawyer
by
training
and
he
help
me
avoid
gaffe
i
always
ask
him
for
a
blunt
critique
of
my
performance
but
he
be
too
much
of
a
diplomat
for
that
when
he
have
something
to
say
it
would
filter
back
to
me
through
garrison
i
hadn
t
even
be
on
the
job
a
month
when
we
begin
get
report
of
red
army
unit
building
up
along
the
border
with
afghanistan
probably
the
u
s
should
have
paid
more
attention
but
the
white
house
and
state
department
be
preoccupy
with
the
hostage
crisis
in
iran
even
though
the
kremlin
be
know
to
be
irritated
with
afghanistan
s
president
amin
for
not
suppress
the
islamic
rebel
in
his
country
nobody
on
our
side
really
thought
the
soviet
would
invade
they
have
never
use
their
own
troop
anywhere
outside
the
warsaw
pact
country
since
world
war
ii
for
me
an
invasion
be
doubly
hard
to
imagine
because
by
an
odd
coincidence
i
knew
something
about
afghanistan
i
d
be
there
with
my
daughter
jeannette
only
four
year
before
we
d
stayed
in
kabul
and
then
journeyed
up
into
the
hill
along
the
ancient
trade
route
sleep
in
tent
and
primitive
inn
we
d
get
up
at
dawn
to
go
to
the
camel
market
and
haggle
for
rug
the
trip
have
give
me
a
sense
of
the
tenacity
of
the
people
and
the
desolate
beauty
of
the
land
it
be
christmas
and
spaso
house
be
fill
with
our
child
and
grandchild
who
have
come
to
visit
from
the
united
state
the
embassy
have
two
day
of
warning
that
the
troop
movement
have
accelerate
and
then
come
a
call
in
the
even
of
december
that
battalion
of
paratrooper
be
land
at
kabul
airport
i
stayed
up
all
that
night
reading
intelligence
report
thousand
of
russian
soldier
be
involve
and
i
felt
the
weight
of
the
world
on
my
heart
instead
of
building
bridge
to
the
russian
i
found
myself
face
with
the
most
serious
crisis
since
the
day
of
kennedy
and
khrushchev
before
dawn
i
get
order
from
washington
to
demand
an
explanation
from
the
kremlin
we
ask
for
an
appointment
with
gromyko
but
the
foreign
ministry
say
he
be
away
the
only
official
available
be
a
deputy
foreign
minister
name
maltsev
whom
i
d
never
met
after
talk
to
him
that
morning
i
nickname
him
minister
no
because
he
be
a
rude
and
taciturn
man
a
real
throwback
to
the
bad
day
of
the
cold
war
he
say
that
there
be
no
point
in
explain
the
invasion
because
it
wasn
t
the
united
state
s
affair
afghanistan
be
a
neighbor
country
with
which
the
u
s
s
r
have
a
treaty
amin
have
ask
for
help
against
rebel
who
be
threaten
his
government
and
russia
have
respond
then
maltsev
say
anyway
it
s
all
in
this
memorandum
and
hand
me
an
envelope
your
position
sound
hard
to
believe
i
say
but
thank
you
very
much
i
start
to
get
up
but
i
heard
bob
german
say
i
think
the
ambassador
would
like
to
have
the
memorandum
read
he
be
save
me
from
a
major
error
because
if
i
have
left
without
reading
the
memo
it
would
have
imply
that
the
united
state
accepted
the
soviet
explanation
the
memo
be
in
english
and
it
simply
repeat
the
poppycock
maltsev
have
just
give
me
i
told
him
on
behalf
of
my
government
that
it
be
unacceptable
the
follow
morning
we
get
word
that
two
entire
red
army
division
have
cross
the
border
and
the
grim
fact
of
the
invasion
soon
come
out
the
russian
have
overthrown
the
government
assassinate
president
amin
and
put
in
an
afghan
puppet
leader
who
have
be
hiding
in
the
soviet
union
and
who
be
flown
in
with
russian
airborne
troop
our
embassy
become
a
pressure
cooker
everybody
go
without
sleep
for
a
couple
of
day
i
be
a
novice
and
not
a
young
man
and
garrison
and
german
and
the
rest
of
the
staff
be
work
on
pure
adrenaline
exchange
telex
with
washington
so
fast
that
i
couldn
t
keep
up
i
say
look
you
guy
know
all
about
this
but
i
m
the
fellow
who
be
really
responsible
here
so
if
you
don
t
mind
i
d
like
to
follow
along
but
they
kept
hurry
ahead
until
i
get
mad
i
told
garrison
i
don
t
know
whether
i
m
go
to
be
able
to
get
along
with
you
in
this
embassy
garrison
knew
i
could
have
him
relieve
but
that
didn
t
intimidate
him
in
the
slightest
he
come
right
back
at
me
and
say
the
point
be
not
whether
you
and
i
can
get
along
the
point
be
what
we
can
do
for
our
country
today
later
on
there
ll
be
time
to
sort
out
whether
we
can
work
together
i
quiet
down
right
away
we
finally
sent
a
long
advisory
to
the
state
department
give
our
analysis
of
the
invasion
we
call
it
a
serious
and
unacceptable
change
in
soviet
policy
and
suggest
that
our
government
make
the
political
cost
to
them
so
high
that
they
will
find
a
way
to
withdraw
their
troop
that
same
day
president
carter
sent
brezhnev
a
message
on
the
hot
line
tell
him
to
withdraw
his
force
or
jeopardize
u
s
soviet
relation
the
uproar
in
the
kremlin
must
have
be
even
bad
than
on
our
side
they
d
make
their
big
foreign
policy
mistake
in
more
than
a
decade
historian
be
still
debate
why
they
decide
to
invade
but
whatever
their
motif
they
fail
completely
to
anticipate
the
u
s
response
we
saw
the
invasion
as
the
possible
first
step
of
a
strategy
to
expand
into
the
persian
gulf
that
be
the
logic
behind
carter
s
hot
line
message
and
i
soon
get
a
call
from
the
foreign
ministry
say
gromyko
be
available
to
see
me
we
met
in
that
same
little
conference
room
next
to
his
office
i
can
t
understand
what
you
ve
do
i
say
i
ve
talk
to
minister
maltsev
as
you
know
but
i
can
t
understand
the
explanation
he
give
it
just
seem
impossible
to
me
why
say
gromyko
well
i
m
not
a
professional
diplomat
but
the
fellow
who
call
for
help
under
your
treaty
be
dead
the
minute
you
get
there
and
the
new
leader
of
the
country
come
in
on
your
military
aircraft
that
doesn
t
sound
like
a
change
of
government
cause
by
event
internal
to
the
country
i
d
never
see
gromyko
with
so
much
as
a
hair
out
of
place
but
now
he
leap
up
and
scream
literally
scream
who
told
you
that
who
told
you
that
then
he
come
at
me
across
the
floor
and
say
your
president
be
shout
at
the
cloud
and
his
voice
be
come
back
as
an
echo
and
he
think
it
be
the
voice
of
god
this
be
all
through
an
interpreter
i
be
stun
and
say
nothing
for
a
few
second
then
i
told
him
i
guess
that
s
all
there
be
to
talk
about
mr
minister
and
he
say
i
guess
so
mr
ambassador
i
get
up
and
start
walk
toward
the
door
but
my
mind
be
race
i
thought
i
ve
get
to
work
with
this
man
i
m
on
my
own
here
so
do
i
really
want
to
walk
out
i
stop
about
three
foot
short
of
the
door
and
say
to
the
interpreter
tell
the
minister
that
when
i
saw
him
in
the
kremlin
a
few
week
ago
he
ask
me
if
i
be
start
to
learn
to
swim
a
little
bit
as
a
new
ambassador
the
interpreter
translate
that
and
gromyko
look
stormy
say
da
tell
him
that
after
talk
with
him
in
this
fashion
he
make
me
think
i
m
drown
gromyko
burst
into
the
loud
laugh
walk
over
and
put
his
arm
around
me
and
say
don
t
drown
kick
your
foot
strike
out
with
your
arm
this
be
just
a
job
you
re
do
your
job
i
m
do
my
job
don
t
let
it
get
you
down
he
laugh
again
pumped
my
hand
up
and
down
and
out
i
go
a
few
day
later
the
president
call
me
back
to
washington
and
i
join
the
white
house
consultation
about
how
the
united
state
should
respond
carter
be
determine
to
make
the
soviet
pay
for
their
aggression
but
in
fact
there
be
very
little
we
could
do
this
wasn
t
a
drop
the
bomb
situation
or
one
in
which
we
d
send
in
troop
the
white
house
and
state
department
make
up
a
long
list
of
possible
anti
soviet
move
my
own
embassy
contribute
a
number
of
suggestion
and
in
the
end
the
president
decide
to
adopt
almost
every
one
this
meant
take
apart
practically
all
the
cooperative
arrangement
we
have
with
the
russian
under
d
tente
from
art
exhibition
to
new
sale
of
grain
and
boycotting
the
moscow
olympics
there
wasn
t
much
i
could
add
to
the
discussion
the
only
time
i
spoke
up
be
to
object
to
particular
trade
sanction
that
go
too
far
for
example
american
company
have
deliver
manufacturing
equipment
to
russia
and
now
they
weren
t
even
go
to
be
allow
to
send
spare
part
to
fix
equipment
that
be
still
under
warranty
i
told
the
president
this
didn
t
make
sense
if
you
want
to
declare
war
or
have
a
boycott
fine
but
break
a
commitment
to
a
customer
be
always
wrong
president
carter
overrode
me
and
i
guess
that
be
the
point
he
want
to
show
the
russian
that
they
d
make
it
impossible
for
business
to
continue
as
usual
i
didn
t
know
the
president
very
well
and
i
be
a
little
surprised
at
how
vehemently
he
react
i
could
understand
his
anger
because
the
afghanistan
invasion
ruin
salt
ii
which
be
so
vital
to
the
world
s
safety
and
on
which
both
side
have
work
so
hard
there
be
no
way
the
senate
would
approve
the
treaty
now
the
change
in
u
s
soviet
relation
really
shook
me
i
be
still
try
to
get
the
feel
of
my
job
and
now
people
start
say
again
that
the
embassy
need
a
hard
nose
professional
to
deal
with
the
new
cold
war
after
talk
to
the
president
i
told
my
staff
i
feel
like
a
chameleon
i
m
go
to
have
to
change
color
the
first
time
i
saw
gromyko
after
my
return
i
make
a
desperate
stab
at
break
the
impasse
our
country
have
reach
it
be
a
personal
appeal
i
told
him
i
don
t
have
any
instruction
on
this
but
it
be
time
to
talk
about
what
to
do
why
not
find
some
way
to
put
this
thing
behind
us
it
s
too
bad
you
don
t
have
any
instruction
he
say
it
s
too
bad
that
your
government
doesn
t
feel
the
way
you
do
i
d
never
felt
so
hopeless
gromyko
in
this
instance
be
icy
as
if
to
say
i
have
well
thing
to
do
than
sit
here
exchange
unofficial
opinion
with
you
i
go
back
to
my
embassy
in
the
late
afternoon
darkness
i
be
deeply
depressed
because
i
be
go
to
have
to
stay
in
this
jail
for
a
year
there
be
no
way
to
leave
gracefully
before
the
end
of
president
carter
s
term
i
be
sixty
six
year
old
a
hell
of
a
time
to
be
lose
a
year
out
of
my
life
i
felt
like
a
rat
caught
in
a
trap
life
at
the
embassy
settle
into
a
dreary
routine
every
morning
i
d
go
to
my
office
and
find
between
fifty
and
two
hundred
cable
wait
on
my
desk
and
dozen
more
would
come
in
during
the
day
they
cover
everything
go
on
all
over
the
world
and
i
be
suppose
to
read
them
foreign
service
people
learn
to
skim
cable
early
in
the
game
but
fast
reading
be
not
one
of
my
skill
and
i
could
never
get
through
them
from
time
to
time
american
politician
would
visit
congressional
delegation
they
be
call
or
codels
welcome
them
be
my
job
but
sometimes
it
seem
that
all
they
be
interested
in
be
have
their
picture
take
for
the
newspaper
back
home
the
first
thing
every
politician
would
ask
to
do
be
talk
to
the
pentecostal
in
the
embassy
basement
these
be
a
handful
of
religious
dissident
who
have
take
refuge
there
two
year
earlier
and
be
try
to
pressure
the
kremlin
into
grant
them
exit
visa
i
d
explain
to
the
congressman
that
the
more
attention
we
drew
to
these
people
the
less
likely
the
soviet
government
would
be
to
budge
but
the
congressman
couldn
t
resist
the
easy
publicity
one
guy
even
have
a
picture
of
himself
with
the
pentecostal
put
on
his
christmas
card
when
i
get
absolutely
beside
myself
with
boredom
i
d
go
out
with
my
camera
and
take
picture
i
walk
all
over
moscow
sometimes
on
embassy
time
and
sometimes
on
my
own
once
i
stumble
across
an
outdoor
pet
market
a
free
market
which
be
still
pretty
unusual
in
moscow
in
those
day
they
sell
hedgehog
and
fat
guinea
pig
cat
dog
and
even
tropical
fish
which
you
d
never
think
of
find
within
thousand
of
mile
of
moscow
in
february
i
could
speak
russian
a
little
by
then
and
met
a
lot
of
ordinary
people
in
my
wandering
some
of
them
be
pretty
feisty
local
shopkeeper
who
d
yell
get
away
from
there
you
re
second
in
line
and
old
lady
who
d
grab
my
sleeve
on
the
street
and
say
shapka
shapka
kholodno
kholodno
meaning
put
on
your
hat
it
s
cold
the
child
always
look
extremely
happy
i
d
always
be
struck
by
how
kind
the
soviet
be
to
their
little
one
even
during
the
hardship
of
world
war
ii
but
by
age
seventeen
or
eighteen
the
young
people
start
look
oppress
you
hear
about
the
awful
drunkenness
in
russia
but
you
rarely
see
it
in
public
the
way
people
drink
be
to
go
into
a
room
on
a
saturday
afternoon
with
a
girlfriend
or
wife
or
group
of
friend
and
close
the
door
the
vodka
bottle
don
t
have
cork
once
you
tear
off
the
metal
cap
you
drink
till
it
s
go
so
they
empty
as
many
of
those
bottle
as
they
want
and
they
do
it
to
achieve
oblivion
despite
the
frustration
of
the
moscow
assignment
there
be
unexpected
personal
reward
for
olive
and
me
our
child
be
grown
and
we
be
able
to
spend
more
time

pretty
good
team

we
go
over
to
leningrad
a
couple
of
time
of
course
we
flew
down
to
georgia
and
explore
the
town
of

which
have
be
a
stop
on
an
ancient
caravan
route
to
the

we
take
a
steamer
from
odessa
along
the

sea
coast
to
yalta
and
the
industrial
city
of

right
on

then
we
go
all
the

north
to

we
travel
to

by
cossack
the
farther
we
get
from
moscow
the
friendlier
local
official
seem
and
the
less
concerned
about
the
recent
dispute
between
washington
and
moscow
i
saw
again
and
again
how
powerfully
world
war
ii
still
affected
their
life
near
irkutsk
olive
and
i
met
a
woman
whose
father
have
run
the
fishery
on
lake
baikal
that
have
supply
stalin
s
army
with
food
that
lake
be
almost
four
hundred
mile
long
and
the
deepest
in
the
world
yet
between
and
they
d
deplete
the
fish
population
dangerously
to
keep
the
soldier
alive
the
fact
that
i
have
be
in
russia
help
the
war
effort
meant
a
great
deal
to
these
people
and
i
be
frustrate
not
to
be
able
to
turn
this
goodwill
to
account
it
gnawed
at
me
that
i
be
so
much
less
effective
at
this
job
than
i
have
be
at
the
gac
all
i
could
do
be
sit
back
the
pawn
of
event
much
big
than
i
and
watch
as
president
carter
s
star
decline
by
the
time
the
election
come
in
november
i
wasn
t
sure
he
could
beat
ronald
reagan
i
be
at
a
conference
of
ambassador
in
brussels
have
to
do
with
human
right
and
i
go
to
bed
on
election
night
think
it
be
go
to
be
close
when
i
woke
up
reagan
have
won
by
a
landslide
i
felt
frustrate
depressed
disappointed
and
relieve
i
thought
just
two
month
to
go
and
i
can
get
out
when
it
come
time
for
me
to
leave
moscow
the
russian
get
sentimental
i
think
they
be
reluctant
to
see
me
go
at
such
a
low
point
in
u
s
soviet
relation
because
they
have
such
great
reverence
for
old
soldier
korniyenko
gromyko
s
deputy
say
can
we
do
something
for
you
be
there
a
gesture
we
can
make
i
say
the
first
thing
that
come
into
my
head
the
best
gesture
would
be
for
you
to
let
me
go
out
on
my
airplane
with
the
pentecostal
how
about
that
korniyenko
look
shock
well
i
ll
talk
to
the
foreign
minister
about
it
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
don
t
think
we
should
do
that
and
i
don
t
think
you
would
really
want
us
to
do
that
either
i
have
to
admit
he
be
right
it
would
cause
a
horde
of
people
to
descend
on
our
embassy
hop
to
get
to
the
united
state
the
foreign
ministry
give
a
small
lunch
in
my
honor
instead
on
the
afternoon
of
january
olive
and
i
step
onto
a
u
s
air
force
jet
at
sheremetyevo
airport
and
my
short
unhappy
tour
as
a
diplomat
come
to
an
end
when
i
come
back
from
moscow
that
january
it
be
the
tenth
anniversary
of
my
decision
to
step
down
at
ibm
i
d
be
disappointed
in
my
dream
of
be
the
ambassador
to
help
end
the
cold
war
but
take
stock
of
those
ten
year
i
felt
extraordinarily
lucky
i
d
succeed
in
regain
my
health
wean
myself
from
business
gratify
my
urge
for
adventure
and
add
honor
to
the
family
name
with
the
sort
of
public
service
my
father
never
have
time
for
it
be
astonish
the
degree
to
which
my
life
and
his
have
diverge
when
i
be
young
i
wasn
t
sure
there
would
ever
be
any
comparison
between
us
he
be
a
giant
and
i
didn
t
think
i
be
cut
out
for
business
at
all
it
take
me
a
long
time
to
commit
myself
to
an
ibm
career
but
then
i
become
a
success
and
for
twenty
year
the
company
consume
my
life
and
my
family
s
when
i
be
force
to
retire
much
young
than
most
men
it
be
traumatic
to
have
to
walk
away
yet
if
i
d
stayed
on
the
job
until
normal
retirement
age
not
to
mention
as
long
as
dad
who
be
still
put
on
his
business
suit
every
morning
at
age
eighty
i
d
have
miss
the
chance
to
go
beyond
ibm
in
any
significant
way
i
knew
it
be
now
time
to
come
to
grip
with
the
fact
that
i
be
old
my
great
fear
be
that
there
wouldn
t
be
enough
to
do
that
my
brain
would
atrophy
and
life
would
lose
its
shape
while
i
didn
t
want
to
take
on
anything
as
hard
anymore
as
run
the
general
advisory
committee
i
d
already
make
elaborate
preparation
before
leave
moscow
for
keep
myself
sharp
i
intend
to
stay
up
to
date
in
the
field
of
u
s
soviet
affair
and
at
brown
university
i
help
found
a
new
center
for
foreign
policy
development
specialize
in
the
subject
to
my
delight
mark
garrison
my
deputy
at
the
moscow
embassy
elect
to
leave
the
foreign
service
and
head
the
center
i
couldn
t
have
found
a
well
man
but
in
spite
of
this
i
felt
low
when
olive
and
i
move
back
to
greenwich
she
say
why
not
just
take
it
easy
see
your
grandchild
go
to
the
caribbean
that
s
pretty
much
what
i
do
for
a
couple
of
month
worry
all
the
while
that
i
might
be
lose
my
relevance
i
still
miss
the
power
that
go
with
be
head
of
ibm
although
i
be
glad
to
see
the
company
grow
under
frank
cary
by
it
have
almost
quadruple
in
size
from
the
time
i
ran
it
to
twenty
six
billion
dollar
in
sale
the
business
be
now
so
huge
that
i
found
it
hard
to
imagine
how
any
chief
executive
could
ever
manage
but
cary
have
do
fine
in
his
quiet
competent
way
and
he
be
schedule
to
hand
the
company
over
to
john
opel
that
spring
opel
urge
me
to
rejoin
the
ibm
board
i
d
resign
when
i
become
ambassador
and
i
told
him
i
thought
it
make
more
sense
to
stay
away
but
he
say
you
be
too
much
a
part
of
the
history
of
this
business
not
to
come
back
and
point
out
that
i
be
only
sixty
seven
so
back
i
go
with
the
proviso
that
i
would
be
call
chairman
emeritus
a
few
year
later
when
i
turn
seventy
i
insist
on
retire
from
the
board
like
any
other
ibm
director
i
d
make
that
rule
myself
and
felt
very
strongly
about
it
the
thing
that
get
me
move
again
oddly
enough
be
give
the
commencement
speech
at
harvard
in
june
harvard
have
a
tradition
of
pick
speaker
who
be
in
the
news
not
necessarily
highbrow
and
i
be
immensely
pleased
and
flatter
that
out
of
all
the
people
on
the
national
scene
they
picked
me
i
get
the
invitation
at
the
end
of
february
and
go
right
to
work
my
father
and
brother
be
natural
public
speaker
but
to
this
day
i
find
it
hard
to
face
an
audience
i
compensate
by
scrupulous
preparation
i
ll
rewrite
a
speech
over
and
over
run
it
past
two
or
three
expert
practice
it
with
a
tape
recorder
in
the
cellar
and
finally
try
it
out
on
olive
who
be
always
a
patient
listener
by
late
march
i
be
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
never
mind
that
graduation
be
still
ten
week
away
then
come
a
telephone
call
from
my
friend
andrew
heiskell
the
retire
chairman
of
time
inc
who
be
a
member
of
the
harvard
corporation
one
of
harvard
s
two
govern
board
your
speech
be
off
he
say
we
ve
ask
president
reagan
and
he
have
accepted
i
suppose
i
should
have
be
insult
but
actually
i
be
grateful
for
the
reprieve
besides
it
s
hard
to
complain
when
you
re
be
upstaged
by
the
president
of
the
united
state
just
think
of
it
olive
i
say
isn
t
it
wonderful
i
be
have
fit
try
to
get
this
speech
into
my
head
and
now
i
don
t
have
to
do
it
but
then
about
three
week
before
graduation
heiskell
call
again
you
re
back
on
he
say
there
have
be
a
big
misunderstand
with
the
white
house
reagan
have
apparently
accepted
the
invitation
because
he
thought
he
be
go
to
get
an
honorary
degree
but
harvard
rarely
give
honorary
degree
to
american
public
official
who
be
in
office
after
reagan
s
staff
found
that
out
they
told
harvard
he
wasn
t
go
to
do
it
it
didn
t
make
any
difference
to
me
not
only
be
i
not
in
office
but
as
it
happen
i
already
have
an
honorary
degree
from
harvard
so
on
june
i
found
myself
sit
on
the
speaker
s
platform
in
harvard
yard
with
other
personage
like
cy
vance
ansel
adam
and
jorge
luis
borges
derek
bok
the
university
president
give
the
first
address
and
while
he
spoke
i
look
around
let
my
mind
wander
i
thought
about
how
old
harvard
yard
be
how
it
have
already
be
there
for
over
a
hundred
year
when
undergraduate
walk
out
the
gate
to
join
the
minuteman
at
concord
finally
i
heard
bok
get
around
to
introduce
me
but
as
i
step
up
next
to
him
at
the
lectern
there
be
a
roll
of
thunder
and
a
horrific
cloudburst
the
speaker
platform
be
cover
but
the
podium
be
not
and
the
poor
graduate
class
be
sit
out
on
the
grass
on
fold
chair
some
of
the
senior
get
up
and
file
away
into
the
surround
dormitory
where
there
be
tv
monitor
set
up
to
carry
the
ceremony
but
derek
kept
everything
on
hold
for
a
few
minute
hop
the
rain
would
let
up
finally
i
say
to
him
this
rain
look
like
it
s
go
to
last
awhile
do
you
mean
you
just
want
to
belt
it
out
now
he
say
yes
i
say
so
i
talk
and
meanwhile
more
senior
trickle
away
into
the
dorm
i
suppose
the
thunder
and
downpour
be
appropriate
because
my
subject
be
nuclear
war
what
i
try
to
do
be
get
across
to
the
young
people
the
most
important
lesson
i
d
learn
in
my
job
in
washington
and
moscow
it
be
very
different
from
what
they
would
have
heard
from
president
reagan
the
result
of
any
use
of
nuclear
weapon
would
not
be
victory
it
would
be
all
out
war
and
total
destruction
we
have
to
confront
the
illusion
of
softheadedness
that
anyone
who
favor
an
end
to
the
arm
race
must
be
soft
on
u
s
defense
or
even
soft
on
communism
the
illusion
of
softheadedness
be
thermonuclear
mccarthyism
because
the
search
for
a
way
out
of
this
morass
the
search
for
an
avenue
of
negotiation
and
survival
instead
of
confrontation
and
weaponry
have
a
long
and
honorable
heritage
our
imperative
be
to
change
our
course
and
to
take
the
only
road
which
offer
a
viable
hope
for
the
future
not
a
road
to
unilateral
action
of
any
kind
but
a
road
to
a
long
series
of
mutually
verifiable
treaty
the
rain
let
up
and
the
student
come
back
to
their
seat
clap
with
great
enthusiasm
my
speech
be
very
well
receive
the
harvard
crimson
ran
a
flatter
story
entitle
a
capitalist
for
disarmament
time
magazine
and
the
boston
newspaper
also
quote
thing
i
d
say
soon
more
speak
invitation
come
in
and
i
found
myself
transform
into
a
voice
for
arm
control
i
hadn
t
paid
much
attention
to
the
nuclear
freeze
movement
before
that
but
my
skepticism
about
nuclear
weapon
dovetail
nicely
so
to
speak
with
the
interest
of
antinuclear
group
that
be
pop
up
all
over
at
place
like
harvard
and
brown
it
be
easy
to
get
people
enthusiastic
because
they
be
student
convincing
anybody
with
real
power
be
another
matter
my
first
chance
to
win
the
heart
and
mind
of
influential
people
come
in
when
i

lively
it

not

young
my
father

told
me
that

grove
be
a
gorgeous
place
and
that
i
should
go
if

have
the
opportunity
because
i
would
never

kind
of
atmosphere
anywhere
else
someone
put
me
up
for
membership
in

take
about
twenty
year
to

long
platform

with

the
camp
you
never
find
out
where

men
can
sit
and
talk

entire
grove
be
crisscross
with
catwalk
and
bridge
and
as
you
walk
around
you
bump
into
a
lot
of
well
know
people
most
member
go
there
to
get
away
from
business
in
fact
the
bohemian
grove
motto
be
a
line
out
of
a
midsummer
night
s
dream
weave
spider
come
not
here
i
go
to
the
grove
as
a
guest
seven
or
eight
time
while
i
ran
ibm
but
i
didn
t
actually
join
until
i
come
back
from
moscow
in
the
follow
summer
come
the
invitation
to
give
a
speech
the
grove
have
a
tradition
of
so
call
lakeside
talk
they
set
up
a
microphone
after
lunch
and
member
sit
all
the
way
around
the
lake
with
comfortable
chair
reserve
for
the
very
old
fellow
when
i
get
up
to
speak
i
could
see
before
me
in
the
audience
such
dignitary
as
henry
kissinger
it
be
my
big
chance
to
pitch
bilateral
reduction
of
nuclear
arm
and
i
give
it
everything
i
have
like
any
good
salesman
i
be
really
sure
that
i
could
win
them
over
my
think
have
developed
during
the
year
since
my
harvard
speech
and
i
felt
confident
that
my
idea
on
national
security
be
comprehensive
and
realistic
enough
to
make
sense
even
to
veteran
policymakers
not
only
could
i
demonstrate
why
we
have
to
reduce
our
blind
dependence
on
atomic
weapon
but
i
be
able
to
paint
a
picture
of
how
the
united
state
might
defend
its
interest
without
them
i
take
the
position
that
give
the
strength
of
the
soviet
military
we
couldn
t
cut
back
our
nuclear
arsenal
without
beef
up
conventional
force
even
if
this
meant
reinstate
the
draft
and
raise
tax
then
i
suggest
that
antinuclear
protester
have
a
point
they
be
ordinary
american
apply
common
sense
to
the
fact
that
we
have
more
nuclear
weapon
than
we
need
i
told
the
bohemian
what
i
d
learn
as
head
of
the
general
advisory
committee
that
nuclear
strategy
like
any
national
issue
benefit
from
open
public
debate
everything
necessary
to
make
decision
on
nuclear
weapon
and
our
relation
with
the
soviet
union
be
in
the
public
domain
there
be
no
secret
and
every
one
of
us
can
and
must
participate
in
decide
our
country
s
fate
never
believe
this
subject
be
so
complex
and
so
secret
that
we
layman
must
leave
it
to
others
it
s
vital
that
all
of
us
add
our
american
common
sense
to
the
input
of
military
strategist
and
technician
there
be
plenty
of
applause
when
i
finish
but
i
be
look
for
something
more
maybe
people
jumping
up
and
send
cable
to
reagan
or
turn
to
the
senator
in
the
audience
and
say
watson
s
right
what
be
we
go
to
do
about
it
of
course
that
didn
t
happen
later
that
afternoon
i
overheard
a
conversation
between
two
bohemian
do
you
listen
to
watson
say
the
first
no
say
the
second
how
be
it
it
be
terrific
absolutely
terrific
i
be
just
start
to
swell
with
pride
when
the
second
bohemian
ask
well
do
you
learn
anything
you
didn
t
already
know
and
there
be
no
reply
i
felt
as
though
i
d
be
drop
pebble
down
a
well
i
talk
to
other
tough
audience
after
that
the
midshipman
at
annapolis
the
student
at
the
naval
war
college
at
newport
rhode
island
and
they
be
just
as
unmoved
eventually
i
realize
how
the
conservative
view
me
as
an
elder
statesman
who
d
be
to
russia
and
knew
his
stuff
but
be
a
bit
kooked
on
nuclear
weapon
i
have
the
consolation
that
many
other
prominent
people
be
also
advocate
arm
cut
and
that
within
a
few
year
there
be
a
massive
mobilization
of
public
opinion
against
the
arm
race
in
the
year
reagan
take
office
percent
of
the
population
favor
an
increase
in
the
defense
budget
but
by
his
second
term
that
percentage
be
reverse
only
a
small
minority
want
more
arm
and
percent
be
in
favor
of
an
immediate
bilateral
nuclear
freeze
once
the
word
be
out
about
nuclear
arm
i
let
my
speak
taper
off
i
thought
go
far
wouldn
t
accomplish
anything
except
to
make
me
sour
i
shift
my
energy
back
to
airplane
and
boat
start
with
a
single
hand
voyage
across
the
caribbean
it
be
only
a
thousand
mile
but
enough
to
acquaint
me
with
the
tedium
and
fear
of
sail
alone
neither
of
which
i
like
so
i
go
back
to
organize
voyage
with
amateur
crew
late
in
i
finally
make
my
long
postpone
trip
around
cape
horn
and
the
follow
summer
i
take
the
palawan
north
again
along
the
labrador
coast
and
into
the
far
reach
of
hudson
bay
i
be
proud
to
be
able
to
pull
off
such
adventure
but
the
glow
of
accomplishment
never
last
long
i
d
no
sooner
be
back
from
one
voyage
than
i
felt
compel
to
start
planning
the
next
occasionally
i
d
interrupt
these
project
to
give
a
speech
or
write
an
op
ed
piece
on
arm
control
or
the
state
of
u
s
soviet
affair
but
i
be
sure
no
one
in
the
reagan
administration
would
be
ask
my
advice
on
the
soviet
union
oddly
it
be
mikhail
gorbachev
who
make
it
possible
for
me
to
continue
my
involvement
in
relation
between
our
two
country
many
year
earlier
i
d
ask
the
soviet
for
permission
to
retrace
the
flight
i
make
across
siberia
with
general
bradley
during
the
war
this
request
be
so
unusual
that
georgi
arbatov
the
senior
soviet
official
i
first
discuss
it
with
have
a
hard
time
understand
what
i
meant
he
thought
i
simply
want
to
fly
a
private
plane
along
the
commercial
air
route
that
go
from
moscow
to
tokyo
lufthansa
and
air
france
use
that
corridor
all
the
time
and
arbatov
say
it
would
be
simple
to
work
out
when
i
finally
take
out
a
map
and
show
him
the
old
lend
lease
ferry
route
across
siberia
arbatov
get
a
long
face
this
will
not
be
easy
he
say
that
be
back
in
my
request
disappear
into
the
russian
bureaucracy
until
gorbachev
come
into
power
and
start
look
for
way
to
warm
up
relation
with
the
west
i
ran
into
arbatov
in
the
spring
of
at
a
meeting
of
the
council
on
foreign
relation
tom
you
can
do
it
he
say
you
can
fly
your
airplane
along
the
old
ferry
route
just
get
in
touch
with
aeroflot
to
arrange
for
jet
fuel
they
give
me
only
six
week
to
put
the
trip
together
several
year
earlier
i
d
bought
a
learjet
that
could
comfortably
accommodate
a
half
dozen
passenger
and
two
pilot
on
a
long
flight
my
copilot
be

and
helsinki
we
cross
into
the
soviet

sent
a
cable
ask
me
not
to
arrive
until
in
the
afternoon
and
i
work
thing
out
so
that
i
put
the
lear
down
at
precisely
that
time
at
the
moscow
airport
as
we
taxi
in
from
the
runway
we
be
met
by
a
small
car
that
lead
us
to
a
special
parking
spot
then
out
step
arbatov
and
general
ilya
mazuruk
a
legendary
pilot
and
hero
of
the
soviet
union
who
have
be
the
commander
of
the
alaska
siberia
ferry
route
during
the
war
he
be
grizzle
and
bent
and
more
than
eighty
year
old
the
lend
lease
operation
have
be
one
of
the
high
point
of
his
life
and
as
he
walk
toward
my
airplane
tear
pour
down
his
face
he
put
his
arm
around
me
and
kiss
me
on
both
cheek
until
that
moment
i
hadn
t
felt
nostalgic
at
all
but
i
get
teary
eyed
too
we
drank
champagne
and
that
night
there
be
a
dinner
where
several
people
stood
up
and
overstate
my
wartime
accomplishment
we
stayed
in
moscow
a
week
make
sure
all
the
necessary
arrangement
for
the
trip
be
in
place
and
i
have
a
chance
to
meet
with
andrei
gromyko
by
this
time
gorbachev
have
elevate
him
to
the
presidency
of
the
soviet
union
which
be
a
largely
honorary
post
he
be
much
more
relaxed
than
i
d
ever
see
him
we
have
a
long
amiable
talk
and
finally
he
dispense
with
his
interpreter
and
spoke
to
me
in
english
do
you
know
he
say
i
felt
sorry
that
you
have
a
difficult
time
as
ambassador
we
have
look
forward
to
your
be
here
you
be
here
in
the
war
we
see
you
as
a
fellow
soldier
and
there
be
many
thing
we
could
have
accomplish
it
be
a
pity
that
you
come
at
the
time
you
do
it
be
kind
of
him
to
say
this
because
it
make
me
feel
as
though
my
ambassadorship
have
not
be
an
entire
waste
on
monday
july
we
finally
left
for
siberia
we
flew
four
or
five
hour
each
day
stop
night
in
remote
place
like
novosibirsk
in
the
western
lowland
just
as
in
the
war
i
have
a
soviet
navigator
on
board
to
make
sure
we
didn
t
stray
into
restrict
area
but
in
other
way
there
be
astonish
contrast
between
the
trip
now
and
the
one
in
the
b
bomber
i
d
flown
then
cruise
at
about
mph
compare
with
mph
for
the
learjet
the
bomber
s
heater
have
be
broken
and
in
spite
of
our
shearling
fly
suit
we
d
be
in
a
near
stupor
from
the
cold
i
ll
never
forget
the
sight
of
general
bradley
wipe
the
windshield
with
vodka
to
keep
frost
from
building
up
but
the
lear
be
design
to
handle
extreme
cold
it
be
always
siberian
winter
at
the
high
altitude
at
which
a
modern
jet
fly
during
idle
period
in
the
cockpit
i
gaze
out
the
window
at
the
ground
below
amaze
once
again
at
the
vast
expanse
of
russia
maybe
once
an
hour
we
d
see
smoke
and
a
big
industrial
installation
but
there
be
almost
no
road
or
village
i
be
remind
of
alexis
de
tocqueville
s
meditation
on
the
untamed
american
wilderness
and
his
prediction
in
the
s
that
the
united
state
and
russia
would
become
the
world
s
two
great
power
at
each
airport
we
be
greet
by
local
official
and
old
soldier
from
world
war
ii
they
d
give
us
a
little
welcome
ceremony
in
a
hangar
with
food
and
soft
drink
and
speech
about
u
s
soviet
friendship
as
demonstrate
on
this
ferry
route
finally
we
reach
yakutsk
the
little
tundra
outpost
where
we
d
nearly
crashed
in
a
snowstorm
during
the
war
it
have
become
a
bright
and
bustling
city
with
ten
story
building
that
the
soviet
have
learn
to
erect
on
top
of
the
permafrost
from
the
air
we
could
see
the
boom
port
facility
on
the
lena
river
nearby
i
put
the
lear
into
final
approach
and
marvel
at
how
the
airport
have
change
in
it
have
be
nothing
more
than
an
open
field
with
a
single
tar
runway
but
now
it
be
a
major
hub
of
aeroflot
with
mass
of
concrete
and
tremendous
number
of
plane
the
mayor
met
us
at
the
airport
and
we
tour
the
town
the
old
wooden
shack
i
remember
be
mostly
go
there
be
no
trace
of
the
prison
camp
and
the
weather
be
warm
the
local
museum
hadn
t
change
however
and
walk
into
that
place
with
its
modest
display
of
drawing
and
native
artifact
and
bone
be
one
of
the
strangest
experience
of
my
life
in
advance
of
our
trip
i
d
supply
the
old
lady
who
ran
the
museum
with
photo
from
the
lend
lease
mission
she
d
make
a
little
exhibit
and
i
found
myself
stand
in
front
of
a
picture
of
me
and
my
war
buddy
in
the
same
room
with
a
mastodon
skeleton
and
the
mummy
of
an
eskimo
princess
before
the
afternoon
end
i
take
an
hour
and
walk
alone
on
the
bank
of
the
lena
think
about
my
life
yakutsk
be
where
i
d
gain
my
self
confidence
as
a
young
man
where
general
bradley
have
promote
me
and
where
the
crew
have
finally
accepted
me
as
their
leader
i
look
across
that
great
river
which
i
be
see
unfrozen
for
the
first
time
the
thought
come
to
me
that
whether
my
life
go
on
many
more
year
or
end
tomorrow
i
d
accomplish
something
just
by
see
the
place
again
in
my
honor
the
soviet
have
locate
eight
or
nine
veteran
who
have
serve
in
the
lend
lease
operation
i
remember
some
of
them
right
away
include
a
stout
little
mechanic
who
have
arrange
for
general
bradley
s
entire
crew
to
get
fur
line
thigh
high
boot
like
the
native
yakut
wore
those
boot
have
save
my
foot
from
frostbite
and
i
still
felt
grateful
to
him
forty
five
year
later
we
have
a
wonderful
feast
and
i
go
to
bed
happy
that
night
i
understood
this
might
be
my
last
great
air
adventure
but
for
the
moment
that
didn
t
make
me
restless
at
all
