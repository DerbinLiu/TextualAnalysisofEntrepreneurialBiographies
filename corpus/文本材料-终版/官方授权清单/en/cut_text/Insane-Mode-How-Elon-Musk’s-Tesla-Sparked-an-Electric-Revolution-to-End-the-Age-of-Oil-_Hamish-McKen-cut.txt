get
your
motor
runnin
in
certain
sector
like
automotive
and
solar
and
space
you
don
t
see
new
entrant
the
first
car
i
drove
for
any
reasonable
period
of
time
be
a
ford
laser
with
a
manual
choke
as
a
sixteen
year
old
who
need
to
get
place
i
learn
the
delicate
art
of
gradually
modulate
the
choke
to
achieve
the
perfect
mixture
of
air
and
gasoline
so
that
the
little
laser
would
purr
like
a
panther
in
a
piano
box
the
car
s
paint
be
gold
but
the
year
have
fade
its
luster
so
that
it
settle
into
more
of
a
dusky
brown
i
call
it
brown
brown
and
drove
it
all
around
alexandra
new
zealand
population
and
to
nearby
swim
hole
sport
ground
and
make
out
spot
in
the
scrubby
hill
that
surround
my
hometown
other
than
master
the
choke
i
didn
t
know
much
about
the
car
and
didn
t
really
care
to
find
out
my
dad
a
physicist
who
knew
how
to
choreograph
brown
brown
s
bit
and
bob
so
that
it
perform
the
miracle
of
propulsion
take
care
of
all
the
maintenance
all
i
have
to
do
be
fill
it
up
with
gas
and
stop
it
from
stall
on
a
black
iced
back
road
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
and
that
be
fine
with
me
later
while
i
be
pick
fruit
at
a
local
orchard
during
university
holiday
to
earn
rent
money
i
do
make
an
attempt
to
learn
how
car
work
by
that
point
i
have
upgraded
to
a
toyota
corona
which
by
my
standard
be
a
luxury
vehicle
it
be
not
only
chokeless
but
it
also
have
an
automatic
transmission
one
hot
day
i
be
on
the
top
step
of
my
ladder
among
cherry
tree
while
my
car
literate
friend
in
the
neighbor
tree
explain
to
me
how
an
internal
combustion
engine
work
despite
my
father
s
influence
and
much
to
his
disappointment
i
be
an
art
student
and
do
not
have
a
mind
for
mechanic
while
i
commit
term
like
carburetor
piston
and
camshaft
to
memory
between
mouthful
of
cherry
i
struggle
to
recall
in
which
order
they
interact
or
if
they
interact
at
all
my
friend
soon
grow
frustrate
with
my
ineptitude
and
i
resign
myself
to
the
notion
that
this
fiendishly
complicate
wizardry
would
remain
forever
out
of
my
reach
and
that
be
fine
with
me
my
ambivalent
relationship
with
motor
vehicle
continued
even
after
at
twenty
nine
year
old
i
move
to
the
united
state
of
america
the
spiritual
home
of
the
automobile
at
the
wheel
of
my
wife
s
honda
civic
i
learn
how
to
drive
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
and
fine
tune
my
aggression
on
the
gas
pedal
so
that
i
could
stave
off
death
on
the
highway
but
i
remain
ignorant
of
how
spark
plug
spark
and
timing
belt
belt
indeed
i
avoid
drive
whenever
i
could
and
come
to
believe
that
the
world
would
be
well
off
without
car
in
one
of
the
first
piece
i
write
since
join
the
tech
news
site
pandodaily
i
implore
silicon
valley
to
rid
us
of
them
i
felt
that
the
environmental
cost
of
car
and
road
be
unacceptable
when
the
climate
be
warm
at
such
a
rate
that
there
d
soon
be
more
death
from
heatstroke
than
from
motor
accident
car
be
death
trap
health
hazard
planet
killer
and
insidious
isolation
engine
i
reason
who
d
want
them
of
course
lot
of
people
want
them
and
path
dependency
be
real
we
d
already
carve
up
mountain
pave
over
swampland
and
invent
garage
to
cater
to
our
four
wheel
wonder
wagon
so
give
up
on
them
now
hardly
seem
realistic
after
a
multitude
of
commenters
disabuse
me
of
my
car
free
fantasy
i
breathe
a
sigh
of
concession
and
move
on
it
be
about
then
that
i
discover

that

in

the
next
month
tesla
s
ceo
elon
musk
appear
at
the
pandomonthly
speaker
series
in
san
francisco
i
be
in
china
at
the
time
but
i
watch
a
video
of
the
event
online
i
knew
little
of
musk
but
be
instantly
struck
by
his
plainspoken
audacity
he
already
have
a
rocket
company
spacex
that
sent
payload
to
the
international
space
station
and
he
have
conceive
the
solar
power
start
up
solarcity
which
he
also
fund
with
tesla
he
be
intent
on
wean
the
world
off
fossil
fuel
i
m
try
to
allocate
my
effort
to
that
which
i
think
would
most
affect
the
future
of
humanity
in
a
positive
way
he
told
my
then
bos
sarah
lacy
at
the
event
there
s
lot
of
entrepreneurial
energy
and
financing
head
towards
the
internet
whereas
in
certain
sector
like
automotive
and
solar
and
space
you
don
t
see
new
entrant
if
we
be
go
to
be
stuck
with
car
i
figure
we
might
as
well
let
this
guy
make
them
electric
so
we
can
at
least
stop
pump
so
much
carbon
dioxide
into
the
atmosphere
in
reading
more
about
tesla
i
found
that
it
have
launch
an
electric
sport
car
the
roadster
in
it
be
the
first
cool
electric
car
the
first
demonstration
that
a
vehicle
power
by
an
electric
motor
be
more
interest
than
a
golf
cart
with
a
price
tag
in
the
range
it
be
sell
largely
to
rich
people
and
celebrity
which
be
a
not
bad
way
to
win
attention
but
also
because
of
the
expense
of
the
battery
an
economic
necessity
musk
however
have
start
talk
about
a
fully
electric
family
car
in
and
it
have
take
a
while
to
eventuate
i
wonder
why
then
i
watch
revenge
of
the
electric
car
a
documentary
that
show
tesla
struggle
to
survive
the
financial
crisis
i
read
news
story
and
magazine
profile
that
told
of
how
musk
paid
tesla
employee
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
keep
the
company
alive
tesla
be
on
bankruptcy
s
doorstep
at
the
end
of
before
it
be
save
at
the
last
minute
by
a
million
investment
and
then
the
next
year
a
help
hand
from
daimler
over
the
follow
year
it
bought
a
factory
go
public
and
then
create
the
model
s
which
go
on
to
win
motor
trend
s
car
of
the
year
award
the
first
unanimous
winner
in
the
magazine
s
history
maybe
this
musk
guy
be
onto
something
by
the
middle
of

musk
start
to
get
famous
not
just
in
the
tech
world
but
in
the
real
world
too
in
august
his
notoriety
reach
a
new
level
when
he
announce
plan
for
a
fifth
mode
of
transport
that
he
say
could
take
passenger
from
los
angeles
to
san
francisco
in
half
an
hour
he
write
the
blueprint
for
his
so
call
hyperloop
in
an
all
nighter
and
then
publish
it
on
the
tesla
and
spacex
corporate
blog
he
didn
t
plan
to
build
the
hyperloop
himself
but
he
hop
someone
else
would
make
it
a
reality
the
ensue

coverage
bestow
on
musk
the
kind
of
attention
usually
reserve
for
steve

give
the
task
of
come
up
with
an
article
about
the
hyperloop
announcement
for
pando
i
write
that
musk
be
more
important
to
society
than

ever

the

musk
be
operating
on
a
different
plane
of
purpose
in
attempt
to
transform
transportation
and
radically
improve
space

instead
of
develop
another

or
the
next
flappy
bird
musk
set
an
example
for
a
new
generation
of
entrepreneur
after
that
piece
ran
a
nonfiction
editor
e
mail
to
ask
if
i
would
be
interested
in
write
a
book
about
musk
reading
the
e
mail
while
dress
in
boxer
and
a
t
shirt
in
the
spare
bedroom
that
double
as
an
office
in
my
baltimore
apartment
i
mull
the
suggestion
and
conclude
that
actually
yes
it
be
a
good
idea
i
take
the
proposal
to
musk
but
be
surprised
when
he
instead
offer
me
a
job
at
tesla
after
some
hesitation
i
be
not
eager
to
leave
journalism
i
ultimately
accepted
after
all
i
thought
i
could
always
come
back
to
the
book
i
spent
just
over
a
year
at
tesla
but
discover
that
journalism
be
an
itch
i
hadn
t
finish
scratch
i
left
in
march
and
indeed
come
back
to
the
book
read
this
book
with
these
caveat
then
yes
i
m
a
former
tesla
employee
i
believe
in
the
company
s
mission
i
even
hold
tesla
stock
but
i
be
also
commit
to
serve
the
reader
in
these
page
i
strive
to
present
a
fair
and
clear
eyed
view
of
what
s
great
about
tesla
and
of
the
very
real
challenge
it
face
this
book
however
isn
t
an
insider
s
tale
i
will
leave
that
work
to
the
gossip
blog
and
it
s
not
just
about
tesla
it
s
about
something
much
big
it
s
a
story
about
how
one
determine
silicon
valley
start
up
change
the
entire
auto
industry
along
the
way
inspire
a
slew
of
well
fund
imitator
from
california
to
china
it
s
a
system
level
view
of
a
technological
and
economic
transformation
that
will
affect
the
life
of
everyone
on
the
planet
it
be
the
story
of
a
revolution
that
tesla
start
when
i
first
drove
the
tesla
model
s
i
thought
of
it
as
a
computer
on
wheel
its
digital
control
internet
connection
software
update
and
ipad
like
touch
screen
do
tend
to
create
that
impression
but
that
description
undersells
its
promise
the
model
s
like
all
of
tesla
s
car
can
be
well
thought
of
as
a
battery
on
wheel
just
look
at
it
strip
of
its
shell
and
seat
the
machine
be
essentially
a
set
of
four
wheel
bracing
a
low
slung
metallic
mattress
that
contains
several
thousand
cylindrical
lithium
ion
battery
like
those
use
in
old
laptop
peel
off
the
lid
and
you
ll
see
the
battery
stand
on
end
and
packed
rump
to
rump
in
eight
module
arrayed
in
tidy
row
like
obedient
schoolchildren
it
be
this
modest
configuration
of
cell
that
be
finally
bring
an
end
to
the
oil
industry
s
dominance
of
global
energy
supply
tesla
be
a
vehicle
for
an
idea
that
we
human
have
well
way
to
power
our
life

most

the

be
a

around
a

onto
a

of
open
road
i
urge
him
to
let
rip
you
can
imagine
what
the
next
moment
would
look
like
in
slow
motion
as
if
it
be
a
scene
from
fast
furious
grandpa
s
revenge
the
camera
would
zoom
in
close
on
his
tattered
right
sneaker
as
it
lift
off
the
accelerator
to
maximize
leverage
for
the
impend
pedal
punch
the
background
music
would
warp
and
blur
into
a
chewed
tape
version
of
a
power
rock
song
while
the
universe
suck
in
a
deep
breath
then
on
its
downswing
the
seven
year
old
sneaker
would
move
with
achingly
slow
surety
to
its
rubber
clad
destiny
before
finally
unleash
the
fury
of
the
leg
s
pent
up
force
on
the
unsuspecting
pedal
at
this
point
the
tape
would
return
to
normal
speed
as
the
soundtrack
s
power
chord
burst
into
adrenaline
spill
comprehensibility
and
the
pedal
would
be
slam
without
apology
to
the
carpet
the
camera
would
promptly
cut
to
our
upper
extremity
to
show
our
head
be
whip
back
against
the
headrest
our
stomach
get
suck
into
a
flatness
they
hadn
t
know
since
we
be
teenager
and
the
stun
stupid
grin
that
assault
our
face
such
be
the
result
of
a
model
s
suddenly
summon
a
torrent
of
electron
from
its
battery
pack
it
s
what
zero
to
sixty
mile
per
hour
in
second
feel
like
not
bad
dad
say
the
model
s
be
so
quick
because
its
electric
induction
motor
can
deliver
maximum
torque
from
standstill
that
same
motor
be
also
able
to
draw
on
power
faster
than
a
conventional
car
simply
because
electron
travel
faster
from
battery
to
motor
than
gasoline
do
from
gas
tank
to
piston
the
car
also
have
instant
access
to
a
tremendous
amount
of
horsepower
the
model
s
we
be
drive
have
horsepower
which
be
comparable
to
a
ford
mustang
and
it
doesn
t
have
to
deal
with
the
acceleration
lag
that
come
with
shift
from
first
gear
into
second
second
into
third
and
so
on
the
car
can
just
keep
accelerate
smoothly
until
it
hit
top
speed
in
fact
perhaps
the
main
impediment
to
even
quicker
acceleration
be
its
tire
which
would
start
slip
and
billowing
smoke
if
they
be
force
to
spin
any
faster
finally
the
low
heavy
battery
pack
help
keep
the
car
balance
so
there
s
even
pressure
on
all
the
contact
point
on
the
road
that
help
the
car
stick
to
the
road
like
burnt
hash
brown
to
a
pan
by
contrast
a
gasoline
car
require
a
large
number
of
step
to
convert
potential
energy
from
the
fuel
into
motion
the
vehicle
can
t
get
start
without
fuel
injector
deliver
burst
of
fuel
into
the
engine
or
in
old
car
pump
fuel
and
air
into
the
carburetor
where
the
fuel
and
air
be
mixed
in
the
necessary
proportion
for
combustion
a
spark
plug
ignites
the
mixture
to
cause
an
explosion
that
drive
the
piston
down
create
torque
that
eventually
turn
the
wheel
for
all
those
thing
to
happen
the
engine
need
to
already
be
turn
which
require
an
electric
starter
motor
power
by
a
twelve
volt
battery
some
of
the
mechanical
energy
from
the
motor
be
divert
to
an
alternator
which
keep
the
battery
fully
charge
meanwhile
as
it
accelerates
the
car
have
to
keep
shift
gear
upward
to
reach
cruise
speed
the
gear
be
necessary
because
the
motor
s
torque
output
can
be
maintain
over
only
a
small
range
of
engine
rotation
speed
complicate
matter
far
the
shape
of
the
car
can
act
like
a
plane
s
wing
air
pass
over
the
car
but
it
take
a
longer
path
than
air
that
travel
under
the
car
the
result
low
pressure
above
the
car
put
it
in
a
constant
fight
with
gravity
so
its
natural
inclination
at
speed
be
to
lift
itself
off
the
road
this
be
a
high
speed
issue
for
both
conventional
and
electric
car
but
the
extra
low
weight
in
the
tesla
mitigates
the
problem
for
gasoline
car
the
lumpy
weight
distribution
that
come
from
have
a
heavy
engine
block
sit
high
in
the
front
or
back
of
the
vehicle
add
an
extra
challenge
in
get
the
car
to
stick
to
the
road
especially
on
corner
by
this
point
you
might
be
think
that
i
m
some
kind
of
propagandist
for
electric
car
and
yeah
maybe
there
be
bias
at
work
here
but
it
s
high
time
that
some
bias
cut
in
favor
of
electric
car
it
have
after
all
be
about
twelve
decade
consider
the
reason
we
ve
be
give
over
the
last
year
for
why
electric
car
just
aren
t
right
for
this
world
cost
the
high
cost
of
the
battery
need
to
power
electric
car
make
them
uneconomical
the
nissan
leaf
for
instance
be
more
expensive
than
a
nissan
versa
but
could
drive
only
a
quarter
of
the
distance
between
refuel
stop
and
have
comparable
performance
range
before
the
tesla
roadster
the
range
of
commercially
available
electric
car
limited
them
to
short
trip
refuel
time
it
take
only
a
few
minute
to
stick
a
hose
into
your
gas

and
fill
it
to
the

most
electric
car
however
need
hour
to
fully

infrastructure
gas

be
everywhere
so
you
seldom
have
to
worry
about
run
out
of

while
on
a
long
distance
trip
electric
car
on
the
other
hand

and
they

they

company
have
struggle
to
make
money
from
sell
electric
car
in
part
because
of
consumer
resistance
but
also
because
of
high
battery
cost
the
lack
of
a
mature

and
the
fact
that
their

almost
entirely
orient
toward
the
production
of

base
on
a
different

technology
the
internal
combustion
engine
as
you
ll
see
over
the
course
of
this
book
there
be
good
answer
to
all
of
the
question
raise
by
the
point
above
but
force
in
the
automotive
and
oil
industry
have
long
dedicate
themselves

perhaps
musk

most

his

a
company
musk
have
say
paraphrase
his
friend
bill
lee
an
entrepreneur
and
investor
be
like
eat
glass
and
star
into
the
abyss
but
it
s
even
harder
if
you
re
try
to
enter
the
auto
industry
where
the
incumbent
have
be
protect
by
high
barrier
to
entry

as
the

altogether
different

not
even
thomas

could

electricity
be
the
thing
edison
say
in
there
be
no
whir
and

with
their
numerous
lever
to
confuse
there
be
not
that
almost
terrify
uncertain
throb

of
the
powerful

engine
there
be
no
water

to
get
out
of

no
dangerous
and
evil
smell
gasoline
and
no
noise
as
the
automotive
era
be
get
start
edison
have
decide
that
electric
car
be
the
way
of
the
future
have
he
know
what
be
ahead
he
might
have
be
surprised
by
how
long
the
future
would
take
to
arrive
he
do
what
he
could
to
help
the
technology
along
in
no
small
part
because
he
have
developed
nickel
iron
battery
that
would
serve
just
the
purpose
in
he
claimed
he
have
developed
an
electric
car
that
could
reach
speed
of
seventy
mile
per
hour
the
follow
year
he
say
the
prototype
could
drive
eighty
five
mile
on
a
single
charge
and
vowed
to
get
his
battery
to
market
within
a
matter
of
month
it
will
be
but
a
short
time
before
demand
for
storage
battery
will
create
one
of
the
most
enormous
industry
in
the
land
he
say
at
the
time
musk
would
make
similar
claim
year
later
ultimately
edison
couldn
t
deliver
on
his
hype
the
groundbreaking
electric
car
he
promise
never
go
into
production
but
he
wasn
t
deter
in
he
team
up
with
his
friend
henry
ford
in
another
effort
to
make
a
battery
that
would
be
suitable
for
an
electric
car
within
a
year
i
hope
we
shall
begin
the
manufacture
of
an
electric
automobile
ford
told
the
new
york
time
in
january
he
didn
t
want
to
reveal
too
much
of
his
plan
but
ford
confirm
rumor
of
his
partnership
with
edison
the
fact
be
that
mr
edison
and
i
have
be
work
for
some
year
on
an
electric
automobile
which
would
be
cheap
and
practicable
car
have
be
built
for
experimental
purpose
and
we
be
satisfied
now
that
the
way
be
clear
to
success
the
problem
so
far
have
be
to
build
a
storage
battery
of
light
weight
which
would
operate
for
long
distance
without
recharge
mr
edison
have
be
experiment
with
such
a
battery
for
some
time
it
s
unclear
if
there
really

musk

the

the

that

that

suggest
that

generally
aren

my

have
this

on

with
a

a

however

entirely
to

get

to
the

that
doesn
t
run

it
take

longer

they
work
a

a

than
it
take

electric

theoretically
less

also
pose

department
their
number
one
source

it
s
hardly
surprising
then
that
tesla

want
to
take
matter
into
its
own
hand
the
origin
of
tesla
s
battle
with
the

can
be
trace
back
to
an
economic
recession

the

for
many
a

you
might
not

you
can
own

if
the

the

in

the
epa
have
found
that
the
model
s
have
a
range
of
mile
per

however
if
you
drove
aggressively
or
go
up
a
lot
of
hill
or
face
strong
headwind
you
could
expect

to
deplete
its

well
short
of
the

mark
conversely
if
you

conservatively
go
down

benefit
from

you
could

to
travel
a
good
deal
farther
than
mile

a
tesla
be
like
an
energy
trading
game
you
mostly
use
up
energy
from
the
battery
in
the
name
of
acceleration
but
you
can
also
return
energy
to
the
battery
through
its
regenerative
brake
system
which
kick
in
any
time
you
take
your
foot
off
the
accelerator
an
action
that
slows
the
car
and
convert
its
kinetic
energy
into
chemical
energy
this
process
help
extend
the

s
range
even
though
the
car
be
tell
me
that
we
have
mile
of
rat
range
remain
i
figure
that
with
the
sixty
mile
back
to
san

and
then
the
thirty
mile
i
would
need
to
drive
to
work
the
next
day
i
would
have
to
play
it
safe
that
thirty
mile
range
buffer
could
be
wipe
out
by
one
too
many
stomp
on
the
accelerator
when
i
m
anxious
i
do
this
little
neck
stretch
thing
or
i
use
the
thumbnail
on
each
hand
to
systematically
apply
pressure
to
each
one
of
my

in

on

like
a

of
low

hyperactivity
as
i
be
drive
that

i
be
do
both
those
thing
i
be
nervous
because
the
prospect
of
be
strand
on
the
side
of
the
road
with
zero

be
unappealing
in
such
an
event
we
d
have
no
choice
but
to
have
the

towed

it

down

at

those
would
have
be

aside

the

of
have
to
explain
to
a

why
our

we

up
to
kilowatt
of

directly
into
the

s

in
about
half
an

it
can
deliver

like
the

the

where

to
put

wherever
people
might
want
to
drive
their

long

supercharge
isn
t
quite
as
convenient
as
a
five

gas
station
fill
up
but
it
be
cheaper
for
owner
who
bought
their

before
january
tesla
offer
model
s
and
model
x
road
tripper
use

tesla
offer
four
hundred
kilowatt

the
equivalent
of
about
a

beyond
which
user
must

a
small

tesla
have
also
make
an
effort
to
locate
supercharger
near

tesla

at

location
in

when
musk
announce
the
technology
at
a
party
outside
the
company
s
hawthorne
design
studio
on
september
musk
promise
to
cover
most
of
the
united
state
with
supercharger
within
two
year
and
the
entire
country
as
well
as
the
low
part
of
canada
within
five
the
crowd
at
the
event
didn
t
seem
to
know
quite
what
to
make
of
the
announcement
perhaps
because
musk
deliver
it
in
such
a
halt
manner
that
despite
a
smoke
and
light
show
somehow
come
across
as
understated
the
fan
in
attendance
offer
only
mute
applause
musk
add
that
tesla
would
build
solar
canopy
over
the
supercharger
so
that
the
site
would
generate
more
power
than
the
car
use
so
far
tesla
have
fail
to
fully
live
up
to
that
promise
only
a
few
supercharge
station
today
have
solar
canopy
still
the
crowd
respond
limply
musk
have
seem
ready
for
a
rapturous
reception
that
be
not
forthcoming
he
consider
this
a
historic
day
on
par
with
spacex
dock
with
the
international
space
station
earlier
that
year
but
few
seem
to
grasp
the
magnitude
of
what
he
be
promising
the
next
day
the
press
give
the
announcement
only
tepidly
interested
write
ups
musk
however
do
have
one
knockout
sound
bite
from
the
night
and
it
promise
a
glorious
escape
from
the
oil
benight
status
quo
he
hit
on
the
concept
of
freedom
note
that
people
thought
the
limited
range
of
electric
car
restrict
them
to
short
distance
travel
not
only
would
the
supercharger
fix
that
but
they
would
also
open
up
new
electric
highway
couple
with
solar
power
model
s
owner
could
liberate
themselves
from
the
bad
effect
of
burning
gasoline
and
so
musk
uttered
a
line
craft

musk
step
onstage
at
tesla
s
annual
shareholder
meeting
on
may
and
announce
a
departure
from
normal
procedure
he
be
dress
in
jean
and
a
casual
blazer
with
cargo
pocket
soon
he
be
join
by
jb
straubel
who
wore
a
white
shirt
and
suit
pant
this
be
fairly
normal
business
garb
for
the
cofounder
but
the
content
of
their
presentation
differ
from
what
one
would
usually
hear
at
an
event
held
to
meet
a
public
company
s
fiduciary
responsibility
they
be
about
to
talk
the
audience
through
the
history
of
tesla
i
think
it
s
important
to
explore
the
history
and
the
motivation
and
the
decision
along
the
way
musk
say
so
that
people
understand
what
be
tesla
all
about
what
do
tesla
mean
why
be
we
do
these
thing
the
ceo
would
do
most
of
the
speak
over
the
course
of
the
presentation
and
keep
the
mood
light
intersperse
the
narrative
with
self
deprecate
joke
about
the
challenge
tesla
have
face
over
the
year
we
have
no
idea
what
we
be
do
musk
recall
of
the
company
s
early
day
like
how
the
hell
do
you
build
a

the
crowd
laugh
with
him
no
idea
musk
start
by
describe
his
first
meeting
with
straubel
over
lunch
at
a
seafood
restaurant
near
spacex
straubel
have
come
with
harold
rosen
an
engineer
with
whom
he
have
be
work
on
an
electric
airplane
rosen
have
brought
straubel
to
help
pitch
musk
on
invest
in
the
plane
project
but
musk
wasn
t
interested
then
straubel
mention
that
he
have
be
discuss
an
electric
vehicle
project
with
some
friend
from
stanford
who
have
built
a
solar
power
car
their
idea
be
that
they
could
strap
together
thousand
of
lithium
ion
battery
cell
which
look
like
aa
battery
to
power
a
car
for
hundred
of
mile
that
be
a
plan
musk
could
get
behind
musk
have
know
since
he
be
an
undergrad
that
he
would
devote
part
of
his
career
to
electric
car
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
he
have
study
ultracapacitors
for
use
as
an
energy
storage
mechanism
for
electric
vehicle
and
far
pursue
the
interest
during
two
summer
internship
in
the
early
s
at
a
silicon
valley
energy
storage
company
call
pinnacle
research
advanced
energy
storage
be
also
go
to
be
the
subject
of
the
phd
he
have
plan
to
do
at
stanford
before
he
ultimately
decide
to
start
zip
instead
two
internet
start
ups
later
he
be
ready
to
turn
his
attention
back
to
his
electric
car
passion
indeed
two
decade
since
he
attempt
to
charm
the
young
christie
nicholson
by
inquire
if
she
too
daydream
about
electric
car
musk
have
finally
found
a
partner
who
could
indulge
his
predilection
for
sustainable
transport
after
the
lunch
straubel
sent
musk
an
e
mail
seek
investment
for
the
project
in
an
attempt
to
raise
it
truly
be
a
fascinate
project
and
could
have
a
phenomenal
impact
on
the
public
perception
of
ev
range
and
viability
straubel
write
it
be
also
a
great
way
to
keep
a
whole
new
generation
of
engineer
interested
and
educate
in
renewable
energy
and
efficient
vehicle
by
building
something
that
can
really
have
an
impact
on
the
field
i
feel
quite
strongly
that
the
future
of
electric
transportation
will
use
high
energy
density
battery
instead
of
fuel
cell
and
this
be
one
step
toward
demonstrate
that
musk
commit
soon
after
straubel
introduce

gage
offer
to

him
to
a

who
have
a

in

on
a

that
could
make
a

for

home
base
on
a
smart
water
sense

but
it
be
the
tzero
that
ultimately
caught
their
imagination
like
it
do
for
musk
eberhard
who
be
grow
increasingly
worried
about
global
warm
saw
potential
for

a

at
the

thanks
largely
to
their
use
in

the
auto

too
no
longer
seem

impenetrable
as
it

be
outsource
many

production
include
the

in
some
case
even

the
men
figure
it
would
be
possible
for
a
start
up
to

build
at

a

with
the
hope
of

raise
more

go
well
a

just
give
them
a

by

nifty
business
idea
to
try
start
a
car
company
in
the
united

should
sit
right
at
the
bottom
the
engineering
part
come
up
with
a
new
car
design
specific
to
your
hope
and
desire
might
be
cool
but
that
s
where
the
fun
stop
from
there
on
in
it
be
all
grind
psych
out
and
financial
massacre
the
cost
start
add
up
early
after
you
ve
design
a
vehicle
that
you
think
people
might
like
you
have
to
figure
out
how
to
build
it
affordably
to
do
that
you
have
to
pay
engineer
and
designer
as
well
as
lawyer
to
make
sure
you
re
on
the
right
side
of
the
law
and
safety
regulation
once
you
ve
clear
that
hurdle
you
ll
want
to
start
produce
car
by
the
thousand
so
you
need
to
buy
a
factory
which
will
likely
cost
about
a
billion
dollar
then
you
ll
spend
ten
of
million
of
dollar
on
equipment
to
go
inside
it
even
if
you
re
planning
to
make
only
twenty
thousand
car
a
year
you
need
to
convince
supplier
that
they
should
work
with
you
this
step
be
trickier
than
it
might
initially
seem
because
your
company
will
have
no
history
in
the
industry
and
will
be
operating
with
volume
that
be
unattractive
to
most
supplier
good
luck
get
the
good
one
on
the
phone
if
you
re
a
special
case
though
and
you
make
it
to
the
next
stage
you
should
be
ready
to
start
manufacturing
car
to
go
to
market
at
this
point
you
need
to
come
up
with
a
process
that
allows
you
to
quickly
and
flawlessly
produce
vehicle
to
keep
up
with
demand
that
do
you
can
expect
to
shell
out
more
for
assembly
worker
and
then
the
lawyer
come
back
in
to
make
sure
you
comply
with
the
highway
safety
act
and
other
federal
standard
meanwhile
test
for
durability
performance
efficiency
and
aerodynamics
will
cost
you
million
more
next
think
about
your
sale
strategy
be
you
go
to
work
with
dealer
or
will
you
build
your
own
retail
network
and
spend
million
more
to
contest
state
law
that
protect
dealer
as
the
middleman
for
new
car
sale
and
what
be
you
go
to
do
about
service
you
need
a
slush
fund
to
cover
warranty
recall
and
lawsuit
and
you
have
to
certify
train
and
employ
mechanic
and
technician
to
deal
with
repair
let
s
say
your
car
start
up
have
defy
the
odds
and
be
finally
boom
then
it
will
be
time
to
hire
thousand
more
engineer
designer
and
factory
worker
you
might
even
have
earn
the
luxury
of
think
about
advertising
or
other
way
to
build
your
brand
after
all
you
need
to
differentiate
your
car
from
the
entrench
incumbent
so
take
a
deep
breath
and
go
back
to
your
investor
to
ask
for
more
money
your
cost
to
date
would
have
clear
a
couple
billion
dollar
now
imagine
do
all
that
except
instead
of
start
a
normal
car
company
you
decide
to
bet
on
electric
propulsion
that
s
a
lot
harder
it
mean
you
have
to
create
a
lot
of
new
technology
and
reinvent
some
of
the
design
and
manufacturing
process
you
have
to
make
sure
that
owner
of
your
car
won
t
easily
run
out
of
charge
and
that
they
can
always
find
a
place
to
power
up
no
matter
where
they
be
in
the
world
you
have
to
teach
people
that
electric
car
can
actually
be
pretty
good
and
that
they
should
consider
choose
something
other
than
the
automotive
technology
they
ve
know
their
entire
life
if
you
re
even
remotely
successful
in
these
endeavor
you
can
expect
skepticism
hesitation
and
in
some
case
active
disparagement
as
you
attempt
to
reach
more
customer
get
ready
to
do
a
lot
of
explain
and
most
of
all
this
be
really
important
you
should
pray
that
just
as
you
re
get

the

t
suddenly
go

a

here
be
an

question
lie
just
across
the

from
its

toyota
originally
want

toyota
ceo
akio
toyoda
told
his

to
accept
the
offer
thing
be
look
up
and
tesla
seem
poise
for
acceleration
but
even
with
a
fresh
hundred
million
in
the
bank
and
a
big
loan
from
the
government
life
wouldn
t
be
easy
to
meet
the
expectation
it
have
set
for
itself
tesla
would
have
to
build
twenty
time
as
many
car
as
it
have
so
far
sell
all
in
the

of
twenty
four
month
by
mid
it
have
burn
through
million
since

found
and
would

need

more

to
equip
the

hire
thousand
of
employee
and
open
more
store
that
meant

do
something
he
have
never
do
before
take
a

public
with
zip
paypal
spacex

until

tesla
musk
have
follow

by
venture

we

refer
to
its
short
live
predecessor
we

around
a

of

have
serve
only
to
increase
the
sense
of
mystery
around
faraday
it
be
soon
reveal
that
the
company
be
fund
by
jia
yueting
the

which
even
more
confusingly
rebranded
as

faraday
be
planning
to
produce
the
car
in
the
billion
dollar
factory
that
it
would
build
in
north
la
vega
sampson
have
told
reporter
that
the
company
s
business
model
wouldn
t
rely
only
on
vehicle
sale
but
would
be
base
on
subscription
apps
car
share
and
other
opportunity
the
company
would
first
launch
a
single
model
and
then
follow
that
with
a
range
of
others
public
intrigue
about
the
medium
brand
tesla
competitor
have
be
sufficiently
stoke
by
the
end
of
to
generate
substantial
interest
in
what
it
would
reveal
at
ce
faraday
duly
hyped
itself
with
a
series
of
post
on
social
medium
that
feature
teaser
image
and
video
promising
a
glimpse
into
the
future
when
amid
pulsate
dance
music
and
a
light
show
fit
for
a
pro
wrestling
match
it
lift
the
cover
on
a
flashy
supercar
that
be
clearly
not
the
kind
of
vehicle
the
company
have
suggest
it
would
bring
to
market
many
industry
observer
be
disappointed
bloomberg
deride
it
as
a
horsepower
batmobile
declare
this
be
not
the
concept
car
you
ve
be
wait
for
burn
a
gadget
reviewer
base
in
great
detroit
who
also
cover
techcrunch
s
auto
beat
continued
the
skeptical
tone
so
will
this
car
ever
be
built
well
it
be
built
because
there
be
a
picture
of
it
here
sampson
reply
you
mean
a
work
one
yeah
will
it
ever
work
burn
s
tone
be
so
condescend
that
it
verged
on
hostile
concept
car
even
one
that
don
t
move
be
a
staple
of
the
auto
industry
and
it
would
be
reasonable
to
give
a
start
up
that
have
reveal
itself
to
the
public
only
seven
month
earlier
a
little
slack
then
again
faraday
have
be
aggressive
in
attract
medium
attention
before
it
have
anything
real
to
show
to
the
public
sampson
continued
well
one
of
the
hallmark
of
faraday
future
be
that
we
re
a
little
bit
mysterious
and
secretive
about
what
we
re
do
he
shrug
his
shoulder
and
in
an
attempt
at
breeziness
that
fell
just
on
the
wrong
side
of
awkwardness
add
so
just
wait
and
see
burn
be
undeterred
so
tell
me
why
unveil
your
company
with
something
like
this
rather
than
something
practical
or
logical
sampson
s
response
again
wasn
t
entirely
convincing
as
i
say
earlier
we
re
a
blend
between
a
consumer
electronics
company
and
a
car
company
this
blend
be
easy
claimed
than
achieve
to
date
tesla
sampson
s
former
employer
be
the
only
company
that
have
effectively
integrate
the
disparate
culture
of
the
tech
and
automotive
industry
at
scale
what
do
that
mean
burn
ask
because
ford
will
tell
you
that
they
re
an
automaker
a
technology
automaker
so
you
say
you
re
a
technology
company
rather
than
a
car
company
he
gesture
at
the
screen
behind
him
that
s
a
goddamn
car
so
why
be
you
a
tech
company
because
what
we
re
ah
the
way
we
re
look
at
the
uh
what
the
user
want
what
the
user
need
sampson
respond
as
we
look
into
the
future
what
s
this
show
all
about
it
s
about
consumer
electronics
it
s
about
our
digitally
connect
lifestyle
burn
look
at
his
notepad
and
adjust
it
on
his
lap
a
man
in
the
crowd
get
up
to
leave
and
at
the
moment
the
car
industry
isn
t
meeting
those
need
yeah
some
company
claim
to
have
get
some
connectivity
but
it
s
just
a
pretty
poor
amount
of
connectivity
and
it
s
not
seamless
with
the
rest
of
your
lifestyle
sampson
note
that
most
people
prefer
the
map
on
their
smartphones
to
onboard
satellite
navigation
system
and
that
few
people
could
read
their
e
mail
while
sit
in
their
car
without
get
their
phone
out
music
play
option
be
inflexible
but
that
s
only
a
tiny
part
of
an
automobile
burn
insist
that
be
the
user
experience
and
an
infotainment
screen
where
in
a
vehicle
you
have
drive
system
suspension
system
brake
safety
chassis
design
and
you
know
a
lot
about
chassis
burn
seem
to
suddenly
remember
that
he
be
talk
to
the
former
chief
engineer
of
lotus
so
you
re
talk
about
a
tiny
portion
of
it
so
be
you
focus
on
that
be
you
try
to
sell
that
part
of
it
do
nothing
else
matter
sampson
respond
that
s
why
we
re
make
the
point
of
be
a
tech
company
and
that
we
look
at
it
from
the
consumer
electronics
side
all
right
burn
say
quickly
shut
down
the
response
to
his
lengthy
question
but
at
least
he
didn
t
get
up
and
leave
six
week
later
the
guardian
report
that
faraday
have
initially
intend
to
reveal
a

that
s
the

for

what

want
he
consider
a

acceleration

when
make

as
a

he
be
an
atypical

you

we

ask

a

hand
go
up
it
be
an
odd
way
to
frame
the
question
the

wireless
connectivity
standard
have
be
around
for

even
in

be
more
than
just
a

it

to

for

by
allow

in
its

of

speed
so
fast

reliable
that

communicate

one
another

with

brit
martin
leach
an
auto
industry
veteran
who
have
cofounded
a
company
call
nextev
sadly
leach
pass
away
in
late
like
faraday
nextev
which
later
change
its
name
to
nio
saw
the
eprix
as
a
marketing
opportunity
like
faraday
nio
be
back
by
chinese
money
its
early
investor
include
the
lenovo
group
joy
capital
tencent
and
sequoia
capital
china
like
faraday
it
have
a
presence
in
california
unlike
faraday
it
have
a
car
in
the
race
i
met
leach
by
nio
s
garage
after
the
second
practice
race
of
the
day
nio
s
two
car
be
be
fit
with
new
nose
cone
while
they
charge
a
couple
of
improbably
handsome
young
driver
with
tousle
hair
and
sculpt
body
have
strip
off
the
top
half
of
their
drive
suit
to
long
undershirt
leach
who
be
in
his
late
fifty
with
whiten
hair
and
a
weatherworn
complexion
look
somewhat
less
like
a
movie
star
he
wore
a
baseball
cap
and
a
crumple
suit
jacket
pair
with
dark
blue
jean
we
shook
hand
and
decide
that
there
be
too
much
mechanical
noise
in
the
garage
to
have
a
productive
conversation
so
we
walk
across
the
tarmac
up
the
stair
of
a
multilevel
parking
structure
and
sat
at
a
picnic
table
under
a
tent
where
the
team
would
soon
be
eat
a
buffet
lunch
leach
who
spoke
in
a
relaxed
english
accent
want
to
know
what
my
book
be
about
i
told
him
it
would
be
about
the
world
s
transition
to
electric
transport
and
its
potential
to
activate
a
clean
energy
ecosystem
yeah
i
think
that
s
fair
leach
say
nod
the
car
be
such
a
fundamental
part
of
everybody
s
life
that
when
you
see
electrification
become
significant
in
the
industry
then
that
will
cause
people
to
think
about
other
thing
the
impact
of
electrification
would
be
profound
he
reason
it
s
the
most
fundamental
shift
in
the
industry
i
would
say
since
henry
ford
invent
the
move
production
line
leach
have
some
stand
to
make
such
a
claim
he
start
race
karts
when
he
be
eleven
year
old
and
turn
professional
at
age
thirteen
before
he
be
eighteen
he
have
won
the
europa
cup
and
have
come
in
third
in
the
world
championship
he
be
then
about
to
start
his
first
full
season
race
single
seater
formula
car
but
his
plan
change
after
he
be
bedridden
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
be
from
essex
where
ford
of
europe
be
headquarter
he
decide
instead
to
ask
ford
to
sponsor
his
mechanical
engineering
degree
at
hatfield
polytechnic
now
call
the
university
of
hertfordshire
his
wish
be
grant
after
graduate
he
go
to
work
for
ford
and
return
to
race
karts
before
again
rise
to
the
formula
level
but
when
he
be
twenty
six
year
old
the
rheumatoid
arthritis
return
this
time
he
have
to
choose
between
race
and
his
career
at
ford
he
opt
for
the
latter
a
decision
that
would
see
him
move
from
engineering
into
product
planning
and
then
into
sale
and
marketing
over
the
span
of
four

can
you

california
be

thanks
to

in

before
ultimately
be
surpass
by

it

in

the

where

ev
be
make

in

then
there
be
the
regulatory
consideration
california
have
be
an
international
leader
in
establish
strict
carbon
emission
regulation
in
the

enact
a
rule
that
require
percent
of

vehicle
zev
by
to

the

board

later
introduce
credit
for
partial
zero

vehicle
and
enable
a
scheme
that
allow
automaker
to
trade

obligation
a
feature

would

important
source
of

for

after
legal
challenge
by
automaker
carb
adjust
its

so
that
in
only
percent
of
new

sell
within
the

have
to
be
zero
emission
but
it
would
gradually
increase
the
quota
so
that
by
the

would
be
closer
to

nine
other

be
in
no
shape
to

of
when

even
though
the

have
unveiled
the
show
car
base
on
a
mercedes
cl
at
the

just
a
cl
with
a
roadster

stuffed
wherever
they
could
put

sampson
say
with
a
laugh
franz
von
holzhausen
the
chief
designer
have
come
up
with
the
style
for
the
car
but
there
be
not
much
do
in
the
way
of
engineering
at
the
time
sampson
share
a
desk
in
tesla
s
section
in
spacex
with
manufacturing
bos
reckhorn
and

guru
wessner
he
smile
at
the
memory
it
be
a
dynamic
environment
he
say
i
don
t
think
you
can
beat
that
sampson
have
sought
to
replicate
that
environment
at
faraday
with
supply
chain
people
seat
next
to
manufacturing
folk
alongside
designer
and
engineer
and
marketer
and
hr
and
you
get
the
picture
traditional
automotive
company
typically
don
t
work
like
that
they
like
their
line
of
division
sampson
left
tesla
with
mixed
feeling
he
be
percent
behind
tesla
s
mission
and
thought
the
company
s
strategy
be
spot
on
but
he
have
reservation
about
other
area
it
be
not
a
positive
culture
he
say
of
his
time
there
the
near
constant
smile
slip
momentarily
from
his
face
he
decline
to
go
into
specific
about
what
exactly
he
meant
but
he
attempt
to
explain
it
by
metaphor
the
guy
who
beat
the
world
hundred
meter
record
doesn
t
do
it
because
his
coach
be
shout
at
him
or
do
something
to
make
him
run
faster
he
say
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
guy
break
the
record
because
he
want
to
do
it
a
good
coach
can
improve
the
runner
s
technique
sampson
suggest
and
help
him
find
the
self
motivation
that
will
spur
him
to
put
in
that
extra
fraction
of
a
percent
that
take
a
tenth
of
a
second
off
his
run
time
that
s
the
approach
sampson
be
attempt
to
instill
at
faraday
he
give
the
distinct
impression
that
it
wasn
t
present
at
tesla
we
re
try
to
enable
people
encourage
people
to
push
themselves
rather
than
be
push
you
ll
always
push
yourself
far
harder
than
anyone
else
can
push
you
after
leave
tesla
sampson
get
in
touch
with
his
former
colleague
tony
nie
who
have
start
lotus
engineering
in
china
and
have
since
establish
a
consultancy
for
new
energy
vehicle
tesla
have
open
its
first
store
in
beijing
and
there
be
some
hype
building
around
the
company
there
tesla
have
make
people
fundamentally
rethink
electric
vehicle
sampson
say
and
prove
that
there
be
a
way
for
start
ups
to
get
into
the
auto
industry
sampson
and
nie
thought
there
might
be
a
way
to
take
advantage
of
china
s
sudden
interest
in
electric
car
and
the
country
s
governmental
support
for
them
others
be
think
the
same
the
two
men
be
approach
by
numerous
china
base
group
that
be
interested
in
start
a
car
company
include
a
consortium
of
part
supplier
and
a
drink
maker
but
there
be
one
man
who
stood
out
jia
yueting
want
to
know
what
it
would
take
to
start
a
company
that
could
be
well
than
tesla
sampson
first
encounter
jia
when
he
travel
to
china
to
witness
the
launch
of
some
of
leeco
s
new
device
in
april
he
have
do
some
online
research
about
jia
but
didn
t
find
out
much
jia
be
still
a
largely
unknown
character
even
in
china
sampson
show
up
to
the
event
in
beijing
expect
to
find
a
besuited
ceo
behind
a
lectern
in
a
lecture
hall
with
a
shoddy
powerpoint
presentation
instead
he
step
into
a
massive
auditorium
fill
with
people
jia
come
out
in
jean
and
a
black
t
shirt
with
giant
screen
behind
him
oh
it
s
a
chinese
steve
job
here
sampson
thought
jia
spoke
for
an
hour
in
mandarin
and
even
though
sampson
couldn
t
understand
a
word
he
could
tell
that
the
audience
be
rapt
just
even
in
his
initial
style
it
be
californian
not
beijing
say
sampson
sampson
and
nie
spent
several
day
with
jia
in
beijing
as
the
entrepreneur
explain
his
vision
for
bring
a
digital
lifestyle
to
car
these
conversation
form
the
basis
for
what
would
become
faraday
s
business
model
the
company
would
start
by
sell
premium
car
in
china
and
the
united
state
but
design
them
from
the
inside
out
with
the
customer
experience
top
of
mind
the
car
would
be
built
to
be
fully
autonomous
so
when
the
technology
and
regulation
allow
passenger
could
relax
and
enjoy
the
ride
on
recline
seat
surround
by
touch
screen
that
would
stream
leeco
s
video
content
one
day
the
car
could
be
sell
cheaply
perhaps
even
below
the
cost
of
make
them
and
bundle
into
a
subscription
package
that
would
include
other
leeco
service
leeco
be
pursue
such
a
model
with
its
tv
and
smartphones
alternatively
the
car
could
be
available
through
an
uber
like
car
share
service
meaning
no
ownership
be
require
and
of
course
the
car
would
be
electric
at
one
point
during
the
meeting
jia
look
out
the
window
of
his
sixteenth
floor
office
and
say
i
want
to
do
it
in
a
clean
way
i
don
t
want
to
just
put
my
technology
into
gasoline
car
after
meeting
jia
sampson
knew
immediately
that
he
have
found
a
partner
not
least
because
jia
agree
without
hesitation
that
the
company
have
to
be
built
in
california
for
it
to
be
a
global
success
sampson
also
note
that
jia
have
some
commonality
with
musk
both
men
be
driven
passionate
and
totally
commit
to
their
mission
like
musk
too
jia
have
his
own
way
of
think
about
innovation
to
make
great
advance
he
believe
you
should
not
look
to
the
future
and
try
to
figure
out
how
to
get
there
instead
you
should
start
from
the
future
and
look
back
on
how
you
travel
there
this
be
a
view
that
resonate
with
statement
from
musk
who
once
say
the
first
step
be
to
establish
that
something
be
possible
then
probability
will
occur
as
if
to
prove
his
change
the
world
credential
the
chinese
entrepreneur
even
have
his
own
silicon

to
abide
by

to

my

now

do
an

at
a

the

be
that
the

be
move
out
of
a
phase
of
copying
idea
from
the

into
an
era
in
which
it
would
pioneer
product
and
business
model
i
highlight
company
such
as
smartphone
maker
xiaomi
and
apps
such
as
tencent
s
wechat
which
have
become
so
pervasive
that
it
be
the
de

internet
for
many
chinese
smartphone
owner
as

lead
innovator

way

if
you

familiarity
with
how
china

have
be
develop
over
the
last
three
decade
you
might
expect
me
to
say
here
that
so
much
have
change
the
clich
about
the
transformative
time
the
chinese
people
have
be
living
through
since
the
country
s
capitalist
revolution
be
so
well
worn
that
it
have
become
as
smooth
as

still
so
much
have
change
view
beijing
through
the

of

my
main
form
of
transportation
during
my

more
tall

and
glitzy
shopping
mall
have
be
built
that
adventurous
architect
have
be
embolden

enable
and
that
western
brand
like
starbucks
and
burberry
have
increase
their
visibility
as
have
local
brand
like
maan
coffee

the

i
might
add
seem
a
touch
more
acrid

the

the

it
be
a
big
change
it
s
the

he

there
be
an
opportunity
for
chinese
company
to
do
something
similar
just
as
xiaomi
have
create
a
compelling
homegrown
alternative
to
apple
initially
he
want
to
do
it
within
qihoo
but
an

didn
t
fit
with
the

s
core
mission
which
be
to
focus
on
security
so
he
left
to
start
his

and
have
since
attract
a
group
of
automotive

now
he

one
singulato

craft
a

concept
electric

the

that
lean

it

by

the
science
fiction
term
that
describes
the
convergence
of
human
and
artificial
intelligence
the
company
like
the
word
so
much
that
it
adopt
singulato
motor
as
its
english
language
name
actually
the

be
one
of

concept
that
singulato

unveiled
before
ask

on

activate
when
the

touch
the
brake
some
of
the
company
s
employee
seem
disappointed
that
this
version
didn
t
prevail
in
the
popular
vote
as
with
its
smart
ev
contemporary
singulato
plan
to
make
its
car
autonomous
and
do
not
expect
to
make
much
money
sell
the
hardware
instead
it
hope
to
generate
revenue
from
other
service
and
product
like
insurance
maintenance
charge
and
smart
parking
che
he
jia
plan
to
do
something
similar
the
be
for
instance
could
theoretically
communicate
with
a
smart
charge
station
so
that
it
could
park
and
then
charge
itself
the
charge
service
provider
would
automatically
connect
to
the
car
to
manage
and
personalize
the
process
while
handle
the
billing
accordingly
if
this
model
prove
prescient
it
would
be
bad
news
for
traditional
automaker
for
which
software
have
never
be
a
core
competency
and
indeed
shen
s
prognostication
for
the
old
guard
be
not
optimistic
if
the
world
do
get
to
a
future
of
self
drive
electric
car
that
can
talk
to
one
another
and
the
infrastructure
i
ask
him
where
would
gasoline
car
be
in
twenty
year
there
will
basically
be
none
he
answer
evenly
he
lean
forward
and
brought
his
hand
together
on
the
table
so
that
they
form
a
triangle
tesla
s
model
s
already
have
a
drive
range
of
three
hundred
mile
per
charge
he
say
and
the
battery
technology
would
only
improve
he
predict
a
four
or
fivefold
increase
in
range
for
electric
car
over
the
next
twenty
year
couple
with
a
steep
decrease
in
cost
at
that
point
there
ll
be
no
place
for
gasoline
car
in
the
market
it
s
certain
to
happen
he
conclude

while
serious
upheaval
in
the
auto
industry
may
well
be
imminent
it
would
be
foolish
to
ignore
the
possibility
that
singulato
motor
and
every
one
of
its
young
contemporary
could
fail
after
all
three
out
of
four
venture
back
start
ups
in
the
united
state
fail
to
return
their
investor
money
in
china
the
odds
aren
t
necessarily
any
well
it
s
harder
to
find
data
on
start
up
failure
rate
there
but
give
that
seven
new
company
start
every
minute
in
china
it
s
safe
to
assume
that
there
be
a
few
misfire
perhaps
singulato
be
naive
about
its
ability
to
capitalize
on
a
software
base
business
model
perhaps
che
he
jia
in
launch
its
sev
within
two
year
of
the
company
s
found
be
be
too
aggressive
with
its
timeline
perhaps
nio
in
attempt
to
launch
its
car
globally
almost
simultaneously
be
be
overly
ambitious
none
of
these
company
have
proven
definitively
that
it
can
merge
the
disparate
culture
of
the
automotive
and
technology
industry
into
a
single
entity
none
have
yet
developed
a
car
that
can
fully
drive
itself
and
no
one
know
exactly
how
china
s
regulator
will
respond
to
the
prospect
of
autonomous
transport
the
charge
infrastructure
challenge
also
remains
an
open
question
as
of
grid
operator
in
china
be
run
far
behind
target
for
charge
station
installation
and
hadn
t
found
a
way
to
make
them
profitable
the
chinese
economy
hamper
by
slow
growth
have
also
be
badly
saddle
with

its
total
debt
in
be
percent
of
its
gross
domestic
product
accord
to
a

result
of
the
chinese
communist
party
s
growth
stimulation
program
to
shore
up
the
slow

how
long

and
a
more
complicate
trade
relationship
with
the

only
make
the

murkier
for

a
large
part
of
the
credit
for
encourage
this
surge

the
issue

less
about

and
more
about
how
pronounce
its
success
could
be
china
be
vital
to
tesla
s
long
term
prospect
and
indeed
the
future
of
electric
car
if
china
doesn
t
go
electric
then
tesla
s
goal
of
accelerate
the
world
s
transition
to
sustainable
transport
will
be
undermined
meanwhile
to
state
the
obvious
the
sale
potential
in
the
world
s
large
auto
market
which
still
have
plenty
of
room
to
grow
be
enormous
and
electric
vehicle
sale
will
be
help
by
the
government
s
mix
of
incentive
and
subsidy
tesla
have
say
that
the
country
could
account
for
a
third
of
its
car
sale
in
the
long
term
it
could
well
be
more
but
chinese
consumer
have
so
far
show
no
great
willingness
to
adopt
electric
car
even
though
electric
car
sale
in
china
increase
percent
in
they
still
represent
only
percent
of
the
market
and
that
include
hybrid
for
a
while
it
look
like
tesla
s
impact
in
china
would
be
underwhelming
china
with
unique
challenge
from
governmental
and
cultural
quarter
be
a
difficult
place
for
american
tech
company
to
do
business
many
have
come
and
fail
include
google
yahoo
ebay
groupon
and
uber
to
name
a
few
of
the
most
prominent
such
company
have
be
brought
low
through
a
combination
of
hubris
lack
of
familiarity
with
the
business
climate
and
misjudge
local
taste
in
some
case
google
s
especially
they
haven
t
work
well
with
the
chinese
government
the
guanxi
weren
t
adequately
lubricate
there
be
some
early
sign
that
tesla
be
make
some
of
the
same
mistake
for
example
it
initially
overlook
wealthy
chinese
consumer
unique
taste
in
particular
as
li
xiang
suggest
the
back
seat
in
the
first
model
s
deliver
to
china
be
bench
like
and
uncomfortable
which
be
a
problem
in
china
where
wealthy
citizen
often
prefer
to
be
driven
by
chauffeur
in
early
tesla
address
the
problem
by
offering
an
executive
rear
seat
upgrade
that
effectively
convert
the
bench
into
two
armchair
meanwhile
some
of
the
feature
that
be
standard
in
tesla
s
car
in
other
market
be
miss
in
china
for
instance
for
the
first
few
month
chinese
model
s
driver
be
unable
to
access
the
navigation
system
on
the
car
s
map
the
feature
wasn
t
add
until
early
other
unanticipated
problem
also
emerge
include
an
issue
with
scalper
who
attempt
to
buy
the
model
s
in
bulk
so
they
could
on
sell
the
car
at
a
markup
a
sketchy
businessman
try
to
hold
tesla
ransom
by
register
the
company
s
name
before
it
enter
china
car
get
stuck
in
custom
make
matter
bad
unlike
other
automaker
tesla
also
lack
a
local
manufacturing
partner
which
meant
its
car
didn
t
qualify
for
some
government
subsidy
the
company
s
china
effort
accord
to
the
new
york
time
be
off
to
a
lurch
start
musk
would
later
concede
that
sale
have
be
unexpectedly
weak
in
response
tesla
replace
a
country
manager
who
have
be
in
the
job
for
less
than
a
year
and
laid
off
as
much
as
percent
of
its
local
workforce
i
think
tesla
take
for
grant
that
they
be
just
go
to
succeed
in
china
ricardo
reyes
a
former
vice
president
of
communication
and
marketing
for
tesla
told
fortune
in
june
but
all
be
not
lose
in
fact
on
reflection
it
look
like
tesla
be
follow
a
similar
path
to
the
one
take
by
apple
which
also
get
off
to
a
rocky
start
in
china
apple
launch
the
iphone
in
china
in
but
be
struck
by
a
series
of
criticism
early
on
not
the
least
of
which
be
about
work
condition
in
the
shenzhen
factory
where
its
device
be
make
the
factory
owner
foxconn
come
under
fire
for
several
worker
suicide
meanwhile
apple
s
scalper
problem
be
on
another
level
the
scalper
be
so
bold
as
to
buy
iphones
in
bulk
and
sell
them
right
outside
apple
store
apple
be
also
slow
to
make
the
late
iphones
available
in
the
country
with
chinese
consumer
typically
get
them
month
after
they
go
on
sale

the
news
that
have
brought
me
to
this
pretty
spot
in

that

to
make
an

sproule
told

he
concede
that
it
would
be
inherently
compromise
because
it
wasn

aston
have
to

somewhere
the

the

who
slump
comfortably
in

it

essential
for

to
master

if

in

even
if

innate
belief
that
the
auto
industry
be
stupid
it
s
slow
it
s
a
mammoth
he
say
they
believe
that
they
could
come
in
change
the
business
model
create
connect
electric
car
change
the
sale
process
and
change
the
way
car
be
manufacture
that
s
also
bollock
palmer
conclude
steadily
hold
my
gaze
complete
bollock
why
i
ask
well
you
can
t
ignore
a
hundred
and
twenty
five
year
of
history
the
auto
industry
didn
t
not
learn
anything
when
you
put
together
a
car
most
of
it
be
mechanical
and
most
of
it
be
do
by
people
who
have
spent
a
career
work
out
how
to
do
a
suspension
system
or
a
door
lock
or
a
steer
wheel
palmer
say
and
you
can
t
ignore
that
so
you
ve
get
to
buy
it
and
you
either
buy
it
through
a
consultancy
or
you
buy
it
through
recruitment
or
you
buy
it
through
collaboration
this
spell
trouble
for
the
newcomer
the
majority
of
those
start
ups
will
fail
because
they
ll
be
too
slow
to
recognize
that
they
can
t
just
trash
the
auto
industry
that
there
s
something
relevant
that
they
need
so
why
be
jia
yueting
different
he
s
not
palmer
respond
flatly
i
mean
he
s
a
very
modest
guy
but
his
dream
be
the
same
these
guy
dream
of
change
the
world
they
dream
of
take
their
internet
model
and
bring
it
into
the
auto
business
in
that
respect
he
s
not
that
different
and
his
probability
of
success
be
about
the
same
so
why
agree
to
work
with
him
because
i
think
the
industry
need
some
of
these
guy
to
be
successful
and
china
be
different
from
the
united
state
insofar
as
it
doesn
t
have
a
successful
auto
industry
and
therefore
successful
auto
engineer
jia
doesn
t
know
what
he
doesn
t
know
palmer
say
and
that
meant
aston
have
an
opportunity
to
help
and
what
of
tesla
do
he
think
it
would
fail
of
all
the
start
ups
palmer
concede
tesla
be
the
one
most
likely
to
make
it
simply
because
it
have
come
so
far
already
but
its
funding
be
tenuous
and
it
didn
t
have
enough
money
in
the
bank
to
think
beyond
the
model
that
s
the
story
of
aston
martin
why
aren
t
we
successful
it
s
because
we
never
make
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
next
car
that
s
exactly
what
elon
be
face
now
the
challenge
would
only
intensify
as
tesla
developed
the
model
in
a
segment
where
margin
be
razor
thin
and
the
cost
of
globalize
the
product
would
be
immense
it
s
go
to
get
harder
not
easy
and
then
there
be
tesla
s
most
serious
challenge
the
company
s
success
have
be
pretty
phenomenal
palmer
concede
but
and
here
he
slip
into
a
coarser
tone
that
the
british
would
recognize
as
work
class
it
still
can
t
make
any
door
that
work
can
it
at
the
time

palmer
continued
still
can

put
a
piece
of
rubber
around
a
door
of
all
the
criticism
tesla
have
face
in
its
history
the
one
that
have
carry
the
most
weight
be
that
it

trouble
in

there
have

with

the

be
such
that
in

consumer

we

our

most
reliable

tesla
say
in
a
letter
to
shareholder
in
february
note
that
the
cost
of
repair
claim
have
halve
in
a
year
still
it
be
not
a
good
sign
to
have
struggle
so
much
with
production
quality
even
at
low
volume
a
company
that
produce
only
ten
of
thousand
of
car
a
year
must
be
consider
niche
when
compare
to
automaker
that
produce
million
toyota
general
motor
and
volkswagen
for
instance
each
produce
about
ten
million
car
in
palmer
then
have
reason
to
be
skeptical
about
tesla
s
ability
to
fix
its
quality
issue
as
it
attempt
to
scale
to
a
production
rate
of
half
a

a
year
by
and
into
the
million
beyond
that
consider
alongside
other

veteran
however
palmer
come
across
as
a
veritable
tesla
fanboy
many
of
his
peer
have
express
considerably
more
skepticism
there
be
nothing
tesla
can
do
that
we
cannot
also
do
fiat
chrysler
ceo
sergio
marchionne

in

two
year
earlier
he
have
ask
customer
not
to
buy
the
fiat
e
electric

because
the
company
lose
on
the

would
sell
the
minimum
number
of

not
one
more
he

the

that
you

a

of

she

the

that
go
with
them
will
evolve
over

token
she
suggest
that
any
wholesale
transition
to

be
likely
to
be
lumpy
if
you
look
at
the

from
a
global
perspective
where
different

have
different

consequently
she

the

ripe
for

you

break
it
down

you
start
look
at

specific
city

look
at

that

you
may
see
a
transformation
happen
in

at
a

the

some

that
by

with

market
electric

gm

first
manjoo
ask
in
a
piece
herald
the

s
arrival
but
it
s
unlikely
musk
and
company
be
too
worried
tesla
have
long
say
that
it
want
to
accelerate
the
world
s
transition
to
sustainable
transport
and
a
good
part
of
that
mean
encourage
other
automaker
to
do
more
with
electric
car
and
faster
we
hope
the
big
car
company
do
copy
tesla
musk
say
in
i
don
t
know
why
they
re
take
so
long
if
anything
the
advent
of
the
bolt
be
evidence
of
tesla
s
success
in
advance
the
agenda
for
electric
mobility
when
ask
for
her
thought
about
tesla
fletcher
applaud
the
company
s
effort
add
great
entry
and
awareness
into
that
marketplace
be
exactly
what

require
compare
to
the
mass
market
electric
vehicle
that
have
come
before
it
the

be
a
master
achievement
it

than
twice

it
boast
about
three
time
the

i
and
be
cheaper
i
test
drove
a
bolt
in
december
it
be
a
pleasant
ride
like
be
in
an
extremely
peppy
toyota
yaris
but
with
more
headroom
the
clearest
evidence
i
be
in
an
electric
car
come
when
i
put
it
into
low
mode
and
felt
the
full
force
of
the
regenerative
brake
when
i
stomp
on
the
accelerator
the
bolt
give
me
a
gentle
jolt
and
take
me
to
sixty
mile
per
hour
before
i
remember
that
i
be
suppose
to
be
counting
the
second
it
be
a
compact
car
but
there
be
plenty
of
room
for
passenger
the
flat
floor
give
the
vehicle
a
sense
of
openness
and
the
trunk
be
deep
and
spacious
enough
to
comfortably
accommodate
two
golf
bag
while
fletcher
would
not
compare
the
bolt
to
the
model
it
s
fair
to
ask
how
it
measure
up
to
tesla
s
long
range
entrant
in
the
same
price
category
the
model
with
a
fastback
design
and
storage
space
under
the
hood
look
more
like
a
bmw
series
than
a
bolt
which
in
style
be
closer
to
economical
compact
car
like
the
yaris
or
the
honda
fit
other
feature
like
the
touch
screen
ui
or
the
access
to
charge
station
don
t
bear
comparison
some
critic
include
former
gm
chairman
bob
lutz
have
wonder
if
the
bolt
be
as
much
about
lower
average
fleet
emission
to
comply
with
government
fuel
economy
mandate
as
it
be
a
legitimate
attempt
to
commit
to
electric
mobility
theoretically
at
least
the
zero
emission
car
allows
the
company
to
get
away
with
sell
its
more
profitable
but
more
pollute
suv
such
as
the
chevy
tahoe
and
pickup
such
as
the
chevy
silverado
a
good
while
longer
it
also
seem
significant
that
gm
officially
call
the
car
the
bolt
ev
as
if
the
qualifier
be
crucial
to
its
distinction
in
the
market
the
name
suggests
that
the
company
see
the
bolt
as
serve
an
ev
market
tesla
by
contrast
have
long
say
it
s
not
compete
against
other
electric
car
it
s
compete
against
gasoline
car
a
look
at
production
number
for
the
bolt
might
hold
the
answer
in
the
first
year
of
sale
chevy
sell
just
over
twenty
thousand
bolt
which
be
a
good
number
but
still
meager
for
a
company
that
sell
million
car
in
it
s
also
a
small
number
compare
to
tesla
s
plan
for
annual
production
of
the
model
which
it
expect
will
soon
be
in
the
hundred
of
thousand
confirm
gm
s
relative
lack
of
enthusiasm
for
the
bolt
chevy
s
marketing
director
say
at
the
los
angeles
auto
show
in
november
that
brand
like
the
bolt
be
important
to
our
image
but
they
kind
of
live
on
the
fringe
when
it
come
to
volume
that
same
month
the
detroit
news
report
that
gm
expect
to
lose
to
on
every
bolt
it
sell
there
be
other
question
too
not
least
among
them
be
whether
gm
dealer
will
fully
embrace
the
opportunity
to
sell
the
bolt
when
i
test
drove
the
car
the
manager
at
the
dealership
told
me
the
bolt
be
sell
so
quickly
that
most
of
them
didn
t
last
a
day
on
the
lot
but
we
be
just
outside
san
francisco
ground
zero
for
electric
car
chevy
sent
most
of
its
bolt
to
northern
california
the
dealer
say
and
a
few
to
oregon
and
arizona
the
bay
area
be
the
only
place
in
the
country
where
the
silverado
pickup
wasn
t
chevy
s
top
sell
vehicle
instead
the
hybrid
volt
held
that
title
so
when
the
brown
suit
come
down
from
detroit
the
dealer
say
they
come
with
smile
thank
the
californian
for
their
good
work
sell
the
low
emission
vehicle
because
it
allow
them
to
keep
sell
lot
of
pickup
truck
and
suv
one
also
have
to
wonder
if
gm
will
build
a
serious
charge
network
when
i
ask
about
charge
option
for
the
bolt
i
be
point
to
paid
charge
post
in
target
parking
lot
and
charge
point
at
chevrolet
and
cadillac
dealership
across
the
country
by
contrast
tesla
have
about
eight
thousand
supercharger
point
and
fifteen
thousand
fast
charge
point
worldwide
by
the
end
of
fletcher
do
not
outline
any
specific
plan
for
charge
infrastructure
but
say
the
company
will
work
with
consumer
to
see
what
they
want
she
note
that
gm
s
electric
car
customer
mostly
charge
at
home
or
work
anyway
still
it
would
be
unfair
to
completely
downplay
the
significance
of
the
chevy
bolt
here
be
a
quality
electric
car
at
a
competitive
price
from
one
of
the
large
automaker
in
the
world
because
of
the
bolt
more
people
will
hear
about
electric
car
more
people
will
drive
them
and
more
people
will
have
an
alternative
to
burning
fossil
fuel
to
power
their
primary
mode
of
transportation
even
the
most
ardent
tesla
fan
and
the
ev

most
morose
mourner
must
salute
that

most

seem
relatively
comfortable
with
their

in
the

as
they
move

sort
of
change
that
i
would
like
to
see
if
you
re
a
newcomer
you
don
t
have
that
incumbent
problem
he
add
so
you
can
look
at
the
business
differently
you
often
hear
the
supertanker
analogy
leach
say
it
s
difficult
to
turn
a
supertanker
and
i
think
it
s
absolutely
the
case
with
car
company
even
if
the
ceo
of
a
big
car
company
decide
that
he
want
it
to
go
percent
electric
tomorrow
he
would
struggle
internal
political
battle
would
prevent
the
bos
from
take
the
necessary
action
i
can
t
imagine
how
he
would
go
about
that
leach
say
it
would
be
so
difficult
i
ask
leach
for
an
example
of
how
internal
politics
make
radical
change
difficult
he
offer
an
anecdote
from
when
he
take
over
as
president
of
ford
europe
after
assume
the
role
he
establish
a
team
to
set
up
a
management
information
system
that
would
allow
him
to
monitor
critical
detail
about
the
business
the
first
thing
that
happen
be
when
they
go
to
everybody
to
get
the
information
people
basically
refuse
to
give
the
information
most
people
would
say
yeah
but
we
don
t
really
want
martin
to
see
that
information
raw
until
we
ve
have
a
chance
to
look
at
it
and
if
necessary
sanitize
it
or
whatever
which
be
code
for
manipulation
it
take
leach
five
month
to
put
the
system
in
place
after
he
eventually
part
way
with
ford
the
project
manager
told
him
the
system
be
scrap
within
a
month
of
his
departure
leach
also
saw
a
challenge
for
incumbent
with
legacy
infrastructure
the
big
automaker
have
factory
around
the
world
work
on
internal
combustion
engine
car
bmw
have
thirty
manufacturing
site
in
fourteen
country
they
ve
get
dealership
agreement
establish
supply
chain
and
long
bake
logistics
arrangement
and
practice
there
be
commercial
contract
to
honor
relationship
to
look
after
they
just
can
t
pick
it
all
up
and
rotate
it
leach
say
imagine
all
the
job
that
would
be
lose
imagine
the
equipment
suddenly
make
useless
leach
suggest
that
time
be
not
quite
up
for
the
traditional
automaker
but
the
clock
be
tick
if
we
go
out
in
the
twenty
to
thirty
year
time
frame
i
don
t
think
the
auto
industry
be
go
to
look
anything
like
it
look
today

musk
be
look
tire
as
he
sat
in
one
of
those
white
faux
leather
armchair
that
seem
standard
for
conference
a
lot
of
people
think
i
m
a
fan
of
disruption
but
i
m
not
really
a
fan
of
disruption
he
let
out
a
short
juddery
laugh
hahhuh
i
m
just
a
fan
of
like
thing
be
well
he
have
just
be
ask
by
ted
craver
chairman
of
the
utility
industry
s
edison
electric
institute
to
comment
on
the
notion
that
tesla
might
be
a
disruptive
force
probably
for
a
lot
of
people
in
our
industry
craver
have
say
while
fiddle
with
his
pen
they
hear
this
word
disruption
transformative
business
plan
disruptive
technology
and
i
think
at
the
core
of
that
be
a
sense
of
the
word
displacement
it
be
june
and
the
men
be
onstage
at
the
hyatt
regency
new
orleans
with
jb
straubel
at
the
institute
s
annual
convention
i
think
the
audience
would
be
interested
in
hearing
your
view
on
this
disruption
and
how
these
company
be
go
to
behave
with
each
other
musk
look
ceilingward
before
deliver
his
answer
i
think
that
if
there
s
a
need
for
something
to
be
disrupt
and
it
s
important
to
the
future
of
the
world
then
sure
we
should
disrupt
it
but
i
don
t
think
that
we
should
just
disrupt
thing
unless
that
disruption
be
go
to
result
in
something
fundamentally
well
for
society
the
business
world
have
come
to
fear
the
word
disruption
because
of
the
innovator
s
dilemma
a
book
by
harvard
business
school
professor
clayton
christensen
that
introduce
the
concept
of

innovation
the

s

laud
by
the
economist
as
one
of
the
most
important
book
about
business
ever
write
lay
out
how
market
lead
company
can
miss
out
on
new
wave
of
innovation
by
focus
on
the
need
of
their
exist
customer
to
maximize
profit
while
overlook
new
and
cheaper

or
business
model
that

realize
they
want

why

by

long
be
encourage
to
use
their
software
prowess
and
process
to

and
hence
we
have
facebook

disrupt
the

airbnb
which

and
crowdfunding
which

when
ted
craver
ask
musk
to
share
his
thought
on
disruption
with
an
audience
of
old
school
electricity
provider
you
could
see
why
the
chairman
might
nervously
fiddle
with
his
pen
could
tesla
with
its
emerge
energy
storage
business
disrupt
the
utility
it
might
have
come
as
some
comfort
to
those
at
the
conference
that
musk
be
no
fan
of
disruption
indeed
he
and
straubel
be
probably
there
to
convince
utility
to
work
with
tesla
on
energy
storage
project
that
could
benefit
both
party
but
the
industry
s
fear
that
it
might
have
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
would
not
have
dissipate
completely
the
same
be
true
for
at

one

the

give

to

the
warn
that
the

of
autonomous

ride

and
tesla
pose
a
large
threat
to
the

than
it
have
ever
confront
before
field
student
of
christensen
be
ready
he
told
the
publication
that
ford
s
approach
be
to
first
disrupt
ourselves
you
know
when
i
first
join
the
company
a
long
time
ago
we
be
a
manufacturing
company
field
say
as
we
go
forward
i
want
us
to
be
know
as
a
manufacturing
a
technology
and
an
information
company
because
as
our
vehicle
become
a
part
of
the
internet
of
thing
and
as
consumer
choose
to
share
their
data
with
us
we
want
to
be
able
to
use
that
data
to
help
make
their
life
well
field
note
that
ford
have
announce
fordpass
a
mobility
solution
that
he
hop
would
do
for
the
auto
industry
what
itunes
do
for
the
music
industry
the
service
would
let
ford
owner
reserve
parking
share
car
with
others
and
pay
bill
use
a
ford
payment
system
fordpay
let
s
say
you
re
go
through
a
drive
through
and
instead
of
take
your
wallet
out
your
vehicle
will
know
that
it
s
you
and
you
ll
be
able
to
pick
up
your
mcdonald
s
and
will
get
bill
through
fordpay
unfortunately
for
field
his
vision
do
not
translate
into
value
for
shareholder
over
field
s
three
year
tenure
ford
s
share
drop
percent
in
may
the
company
replace
field
as
ceo
with
jim
hackett
who
have
be
responsible
for
ford
s
autonomous
drive
effort
to
realize
its
forward
look
vision
and
become
a
leader
in
automotive
technology
ford
would
need
the
service
of
the
world
s
best
software
developer
which
would
mean
compete
not
only
against
other
automaker
but
also
against
silicon
valley
s
hottest
company
in
the
new
era
of
automotive
software
be
king
with
that
shift
come
an
opening
for
software
focus
company
like
tesla
in
many
case
large
car
company
or
truck
company
be
not
focus
on
software
they
re
not
focus
on
sensor
or
battery
straubel
say
in
and
this
give
an
opportunity
for
innovation
for
new
company
and
new
entrant
to
play
on
a
bit
more
of
a
level
play
field
than
there
ever
be
in
the
past
tesla
however
be
not
a
disrupter
by

harvard
business
review
christensen

his
coauthor
michael
raynor

say
tesla
didn
t
fit
the
disruptive
innovation
model
because
its
foothold
be
in
the
high
end

significant
attention
and
investment
from

if
disruption
theory
be
correct
christensen
conclude
tesla
s
future
hold
either
acquisition
by
a
much
large
incumbent
or
a
year
long
and
hard
fought
battle
for
market
significance
tesla
may
not
fit
christensen
s
classic
definition
of
disruption
but
that
doesn
t
mean
the
auto
industry
shouldn
t
be
concerned
after
all
the
theory
have
show
its
limitation
in
the
past
in
five
month
after
the
iphone
be
announce
and
eleven
day
before
it
hit

christensen
predict
the
smartphone
wouldn
t
succeed
they
ve
launch
an
innovation
that
the
exist
player
in
the

be
heavily
motivate
to
beat
he
say
in
an
interview
add
that
history
speaks
loudly
on
that
point
and
the
probability
of
success
be
go
to
be
limited
tesla
doesn
t
seem
to
care
about
the
semantics
at
a
conference
in
november
straubel
say
the
company
doesn
t
even
think
about
disruption
we
don
t
sit
around
think
of
how
can
we
disrupt
something
else
today
he
say
that
s
never
happen
inside
of
tesla
i
ve
never
be
in
a
meeting
where
disruption
be
the
focus
of
the
meeting
instead
tesla
just
think
about
how
to
best
make
use
of
available
technology
to
make
an
amaze
product
it
s
really
that
simple
we
just
look
at
the
customer
and
the
technology
we
put
them
together
we
try
and
invent
a
new
product
innovate
new
feature
around
that
one
can
get
too
tangle
up
in
theory
christensen
s
disruption
might
have
its
own
specific
meaning
but
the
dictionary
definition
of
disrupt
offer
a
broader
understand
to
cause
something
to
be
unable
to
continue
in
the
normal
way
with
that
we
can
safely
put
aside
our
copy
of
the

its

not

i
m
with

nursing

yeah
he
say
his
voice
slightly
raspy
with
age
the
standard
version
be
thirty
five
thousand
dollar
but
if
you
want
it
in
any
color
other
than
black
that
s
another
thousand
dollar
so
that

the

there
wasn

enough

so

a

initially
it
plan

that
would

five
gigawatt

a

by
but
tesla
later
revise
that
figure

fifty
gigawatt

by
the
factory
would
not
only
serve
tesla
s
supply
need
the
company
explain
in

also
reduce

by

itself
as
the
large

in

even
as
an

luddite
i
appreciate
the

as

fell
in
the

it
struck
me
in
an
obvious
high
school
poetry
kind
of
way
that
the
juxtaposition
of
these
titan
of
the
gasoline
era
with
the
tesla
park
outside
the
gigafactory
twenty
three

told
a
pat
story
about
the
past
and
future
of
the
automobile
that
today
s
car
be
tomorrow
s
relic
that
the
thousand
who
come
as
tourist
for
the
display
of
the
internal
combustion
engine
s
full
glory
be
outnumber
by
the
thousand
who
have
arrive
to
build
an
electric
future
but
it
be
also
hard
to
picture
a
scenario
in
which
a
hobbyist
s
love
for
an
electric
car
would
have
quite
the
same
animal
effect
as
a
man
s
love
for
his
painstakingly
restore
ride
a
large
part
of
the
satisfaction
to
be
glean
from
classic
car
ownership
come
from
the
perfect
purr
of
the
internal

engine
tune
just
so
tweaked
precisely
to
an
individual
s
taste
an
electric
car
might
be
able
to
match
a
gasoline
car
s
curve
but
it
can
never
match
its
soul
i
be
surprised
to
find
myself
think
these
thing
especially
give
that
i
have
no
love
for

guzzler
but
perhaps
i
felt
a
sense
of
imminent
loss
that
these
nostalgic
car
meet
ups
might
be
the
only
way
my

i
grow

there

not

today
to

a

high
these

you

it
just

produce
ridiculous
amount
of

with
the

it
be

the

musk

all

this

we

musk

a
move
that
would
put
it

it

it

in

state

the

so
complex

that
it
embodies
dare

at

however
electrek
s

that

be
convincing
enough
he
tweet

already
prim
to

attack
on
his

at

in
may
he
be
ask
if
he
have
a
message
for
the
nation
s
oil
company
musk
reply
that
it
s
hard
to
ask
oil
company
to
act
against
their
best
interest
the
incentive
structure
of
the
prevail
system
he
note
apply
no
penalty
to
dump
carbon

into
the

and
atmosphere
he
say
he
be
in
favor
of
a
carbon
tax
that
would
encourage
well
behavior
just
as
cigarette
and
alcohol
be
heavily
taxed
because
of
their
bad
health
effect
a
couple
of
minute
later
after
a
digression
about
the
necessity
of
tax
musk
do
raise
one
complaint
i
guess
where
i
have
an
issue
with
the
oil
and
gas
guy
be
where
they
sometimes
engage
in
nefarious
tactic
he
say
or
thing
that
be
somewhat
insidious
like
funding
academic
study
that
people
can
then
point
to
as
though
they
have
some
credibility
and
it
s
some
prominent
professor
somewhere
but
that
person
have
be
paid
off
by
the
oil
industry
to
write
that
study
such
behavior
should
be
condemn
in
the
strong
term
he
say
he
recommend
that
people
read
merchant
of
doubt
by
science
historian
naomi
oreskes
and
erik
conway
that
actually
spell
it
out
in
detail
how
some
of
these
thing
be
go
on
where
the
oil
and
gas
industry
all
they
need
to
do
be
create
doubt
and
that
s
what
they
ve
do
in
fact
some
oil
group
have
employ
the
same
individual
and
firm
that
the
tobacco
industry
use
to
sow
doubt
about
the
link
between
smoking
and
lung
cancer
i
m
surprised
that
some
of
these
people
be
still
around
because
like
you
know
they
re
quite
old
he
say
with
a
wry
laugh
in
merchant
of
doubt
which
be
publish
in
oreskes
and
conway
show
how
special
interest
group
conduct
sophisticated
public
relation
campaign
to
prevent
government
action
on
a
range
of
environmental
and
health
issue
tie
to
industry
and
commerce
the
group
realize
that
they
didn
t
need
to
disprove
finding
that
work
against
their
interest
but
that
create
doubt
be
enough
to
confuse
the
public
and
get
politician
to
assist
in
their
effort
to
slow
down
the
regulatory
process
these
individual
and
group
repeatedly
use
such
tactic
to
stymie
public
mind
measure
to
mitigate

the

a

dear
to

the
koch
believe
that
the

nonexistent
they

largely

their

it
be
not
without
reason
then
that
musk
be
concerned
about
the
potential
for
the
koch
brother
to
be
collude
with
fortune
indeed
in

if

why
be

the
answer
be
that
it
be
supplant
by
an

that
change

the

this

the

the
opening
of

the

it
also
make

ever
i
first
come
across
sears
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
long
nose
and
deep
set
eye
when
i
watch
a
ted
talk
he
give
in
about
planning
for
the
end
of
oil
in
that
speech
he
note
that
there
be
a
hundred
trillion
gallon
of
crude
oil
in
the
world
still
to
be
developed
and
that
it
would
never
run
out
it
s
not
because
we
have
a
lot
of
it
he
say
it
s
not
because
we
re
go
to
build
a
bajillion
windmill
it
s
because
well
thousand
of
year
ago
people
have
idea
innovation
technology
and
the
stone
age
end
not
because
we
ran
out
of
stone
sears
be
paraphrase
former
saudi
arabian
oil
minister
sheikh
ahmed
zaki
yamani
who
make
the
statement
in
innovation
would
provide
the
way
out
of
the
oil
era
sears
s
career
have
take
him
all
around
the
world
but
he
now
life
in
a
house
on
a
hill
in
danville
california
with
his
wife
he
own
a
mg
in
fire
engine
red
a
machine
so
beautiful
that
he
custom
built
a
clapboard
garage
especially
for
it
inside
he
have
hung
old
shell
memorabilia
on
the
wall
that
day
at
stanford
sears
be
wear
the
relaxed
uniform
of
silicon
valley
a
polo
shirt
and
jean
he
spoke
slowly
and
somewhat
theatrically
pepper
his
speech
with
guess
whats
and
by
the
way
in
the
manner
of
someone
accustom
to
make
a
case
before
a
crowd
as
he
say
in
his
ted
talk
sears
believe
that
it
s
technology
that
drive
great
economic
change
and
that
the
same
will
prove
true
for
the
world
s
energy
economy
the
revolution
be
not
a
molecule
he
told
me
it
s
the
system
it
be
sears
who
give
me
the
idea
that
oil
could
be
thought
of
in
the
same
way
as
salt
right
now
he
say
when
people
talk
about
the
end
of
oil
lot
of
people
will
quickly
go
to
okay
well
what
s
it
go
to
be
instead
and
they
start
think
about
well
what
molecule
can
i
make
that
you
would
use
instead
of
gasoline
in
your
internal
combustion
engine
but
that
s
not
what
kill
salt
salt
didn
t
die
as
a
global
and
strategic
commodity
because
somebody
found
another
molecule
that
they
could
go
dig
up
in
the
dirt
that
be
well
the
real
culprit
be
refrigeration
which
seemingly
come
out
of
nowhere
who
would
have
thought
sears
ask
his
tone
rise
in
feign
disbelief
sears
be
sympathetic
to
the
idea
that
electric
vehicle
might
bring
about
the
end
of
oil
especially
when
car
share
service
like
uber
be
add
to
the
equation
toward
the
end
of
our
interview
we
start
discuss
the
factor
that
might
help
or
hinder
the
widespread
adoption
of
electric
vehicle
the
subject
of
regulation
come
up
and
he
posit
that
if
it
look
like
million
of
job
would
be
lose
in
the
disruption
of
say
detroit
s
auto
industry
politics
might
slow
the
rate
of
progress
i
suggest
to
sears
that
the
koch
brother
would
fund
obfuscation
effort
against
electric
car
too
and
interfere
with
the
regulatory
process
the
koch
have
an
extensive
history
of
use
their
money
and
power
to
influence
politics
and
government
they
be
strong
opponent
of
government
regulation
and
subsidy
particularly
as
they
pertain
to
environmental
policy
they
have
also
demonstrate
an
ability
to
obstruct
regulation
that
would
address
climate
change
even
through
market
base
mean
such
as
a
carbon
tax
look
at
koch
industry
business
and
past
trouble
with
the
regulatory
sector
it
s
not
hard
to
see
why
the
brother
each
worth
about
billion
and
among
the
top
ten
richest
people
in
the
world
might
object
to
government
action
on
carbon
emission
and
other
pollution
for
example
the
koch
own
more
acre
of
canada
s
tar
sand
than
any
other
non
canadian
company
include
exxon
chevron
and
conoco
while
koch
industry
and
its
subsidiary
have
a
diverse
set
of
business
interest
from
polymer
and
fiber
to
forestry
and
cattle
ranch
they
also
preside
over
a
fossil
fuel
empire
of
infrastructure
refinery
pipeline
storage
and
shipping
and
they
profit
from
fossil
fuel
related
financial
instrument
such
as
an
oil
derivative
that
they
co
invent
the
university

koch

and
note
that
it
release
million
pound
of
toxic
chemical
into
the
air
in
koch
industry
have
respond
by
note
that
the
amherst

include
virtually
every
manufacturer
in
the

the

the

have

the

may
be
the
most
important
unelected
political
figure
in
american
history
back
on
the
stanford
campus
as
our
conversation
turn
to
how
regulation
could
affect
the
transition
to
electric
vehicle
sears
question
the
wisdom
of
focus
on
the
koch
he
wonder
whether
or
not
a
community
of
climate
scientist
could
do
a
well
job
of
communicate
and
building
a
coalition
to
change
people
s
mind
about
climate
change
action
rather
than
whine
about
the
koch
brother
he
felt
the
koch
be
a
little
blip
on
the
radar
sears
be
lean
back
in
his
chair
it
be
close
to
p
m
and
we
have
be
speak
for
more
than
two
hour
he
have
brought
a
bottle
of
diet
coke
to
our
meeting
it
now
lay
empty
on
its
side
on
the
table
in
front
of
us
summer
school
student
be
bring
out
pitcher
of
beer
to
the
table
around
us
sears
believe
that
people
on
all
side
of
the
argument
about
climate
change
be
guilty
of
distort
science
if
i
happen
to
be
an
academic
and
i
want
to
do
climate
study
and
my
life
and
future
be
about
get
support
for
my
academic
study
sears
say
there
s
a
lot
of
money
out
there
to
support
a
certain
point
of
view
i
agree
and
he
continued
well
be
i
be
cynical
you
know
in
the
same
way
that
the
koch
brother
be
try
to
preserve
their
world
i
think
this
be
an
equal
opportunity
sport
there
be
a
lot
of
people
try
to
preserve
their
world
i
reply
that
the
economic
incentive
for
each
side
be
lopsided
there
s
probably
some
scientist
who
be
make
their
research
fit
neatly
with
the
accepted
view
so
that
they
can
ensure
they
ve
get
a
safe
career
i
say
but
i
think
that
that
s
pretty
small
compare
to
a
multitrillion
dollar
oil
industry
that
stand
to
lose
a
lot
more
if
they
re
force
to
meet
these
regulation
in
may
there
appear

the

action
urge
it
to

at
the

the

since
the

but
the
sec
chose
not
to
act
back
at
stanford
rich
sears
make
the
case
that
people
aren
t
seriously
willing
to
sacrifice
quality
of
life
in
exchange
for
give
up
fossil
fuel
we
re
not
go
to
all
freeze
in
the
dark
so
environmental
activist
should
stop
demonize
the
oil
company
and
the
koch
you
still
need
them
this
be
true
we
have
all
benefit
from
oil
throughout
our
life
much
of
the
food
we
eat
be
transport
by
gasoline
burning
vehicle
almost
every
time
we
get
in
a
car
we
re
move
from
place
to
place
by
the
combustion
of
gasoline
and
air
we
fly
from
country
to
country
thanks
to
oil
the
lifestyle
we
demand
be
the
primary
reason
why
oil
company
be
so
profitable
it
would
be
unfair
to
condemn
them
for
sell
us
something
that
we
demand
virtually
every
day
now
sears
continued
if
you
want
thing
to
change
and
you
recognize
that
one
of
the
problem
be
that
nobody
s
really
pay
for
the
carbon
fine
then
put
a
price
on
carbon
and
the
oil
company
have
all
say
and
they
ve
all
be
serious
they
re
not
just
say
it
put
a
price
on
carbon
just
do
it
so
why
doesn
t
that
get
pass
i
ask
i
think
because
of
the
politics
of
it
the
way
it
s
handle
sears
reply
the
environmental
community
do
itself
a
terrible
disservice
when
they
want
to
talk
about
climate
denier
and
whine
about
the
koch
brother
and
sue
exxon
how
can
you
go
sue
exxon
because
they
suppress
climate
science
they
knew
in
their
lab
that
this
be
a
problem
yeah
and
how
do
you
find
that
because
they
publish
all
those
paper
they
weren
t
suppress
anything
sears
be
right
that
the
large
oil
company
agree
to
put
a
price
on
carbon
exxon
bp
and
shell
have
all
spoken
in
favor
of
it
a
tax
would
ensure
a
uniform
and
predictable
cost
of
carbon
an
exxon
spokesperson
say
and
allow
market
force
to
drive
solution
it
be
one
thing
they
could
agree
on
with
environmental
group
in
june
however
the
republican
control
house
of
representative
approve
a
resolution
to
condemn
such
a
tax
here
s
how
bloomberg
explain
it
the
house
strategy
push
by
majority
whip
steve
scalise
a
louisiana
republican
and
back
by
koch
industry
inc
use
the
symbolic
measure
to
lock
in
vote
against
a
tax
on
carbon
dioxide
emission
blame
for
climate
change
the
tactic
be
design
to
weaken
the
ability
of
a
future
president
and
congress
to
levy
a
carbon
tax
to
help
pay
for
a
broad
overhaul
of
the
us
tax
code
say
republican
strategist
mike
mckenna
sears
be
also
right
about
exxon
go
public
with
its
climate
change
study
the
company
s
scientist
have
publish
peer
review
paper
and
spoken
at
conference
about
the
effect
a
warm
planet
would
have
on
the
industry
and
humanity
however
the
criticism
direct
at
exxon
concerned
not
the
company
s
secrecy
but
its
role
in
create
doubt
about
climate
science
through
public
relation
campaign
and
other
public
statement
sears
go
on
to
argue
that
environmentalist
have
turn
global
warm
into
a
belief
system
that
label
people
climate
denier
doesn
t
help
anyone
change
their
mind
and
it
doesn
t
help
bring
people
with
different
viewpoint
together
but
he
be
not
advocate
inaction
on
the
contrary
he
believe
we
should
get
off
oil
regardless
of
whether
or
not
climate
change
be
human
power
or
even
a
bad
thing
on
general
principle
the
fact
that
we
re
burning
all
of
this
legacy
carbon
pull
it
out
of
the
ground
in
huge
quantity
and
dump
it
into
the
atmosphere
as
carbon
dioxide
on
first
principle
that
s
a
bad
idea
sears
share
a
key
belief
with
environmentalist
the
world
need
to
stop
add
to
the
concentration
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
atmosphere
and
fast
but
he
recoil
at
the
thought
of
an
oversimplify
political
debate
when
as
he
point
out
these
be
all
complex
system
the
talk
head
don
t
want
to
acknowledge
the
complexity
he
say
they
want
a
simple
story
that
boil
down
nicely
to
the
sound
bite
to
the
headline
and
they
want
to
run
with
it
and
so
it
end
up
be
the
koch
brother
be
bad
and
climate
change
be
bad
and
exxon
be
bad
and
you
know
i
think
people
ought
to
be
for
stuff
not
against
stuff
i
think
you
could
be
much
more
effective
if
you
be

whatever
you
think
of

elon
musk
didn
t
build

by
whine
about
the
internal

right
i
agree
he
could
ve
well
now
he

i
say
add
quote
unquote
whine
okay
fine
sears
say
with
a
sigh
he
s
waste
his
time
he
need
to
focus
on
something
more
positive
but
seriously
what
he
have
do
what
he
have
built
be
not
built
through
whine
he
inspire
a
vision
of
hope
i
offer
that
s
right
yeah
and
just
maybe
it
will
turn
into
part
of
an
energy
transportation
something
something
revolution
the
whine
s
not
go
to
change
any
of
that
the
whine
s
not
go
to
make
the
koch
brother
go
away
eventually
they
ll
die
and
the
government
will
take
most
of
their
money
and
that
will
be
that
yes
eventually
the
koch
will
die
charles
be
in
his
eighty
and
david
be
in
his
late
seventy
but
they
may
leave

great
than

contribute
to

coffer
block
the
passage
of
a
carbon
tax
support
by
both
environmentalist
and
oil
company
be
one
such
legacy
create
confusion
about
clean
energy
subsidy
and
slow
the
transition
to
electric
mobility
could
be
another

heaven
or
hell
there
be
certain
important
thing
that
we
must
do
in
order
for
the
future
to
be
good
i
met
carsten
breitfeld
in
july
on
the
sunny
patio
at
a
hotel
on
san
jose
s
santana
row
a
glitzy
pedestrian
shopping
mall
we
sat
under
the
half
shade
of
an
umbrella
amid
fountain
and
hotel
guest
in
tank
top
and
sunglass
happily
chat
over
breakfast
breitfeld
in
a
polo
shirt
and
jean
have
brushlike
brown
hair
kept
tame
on
the
side
with
a
buzz
cut
it
be
a
saturday
morning
and
he
seem
relaxed
but
it
be
his
first
day
off
in
six
week
he
life
in
hong
kong
now
but
he
be
visit
silicon
valley
on
a
tour
of
tech
company
with
which
his
new
car
company
future
mobility
later
rename
byton
might
partner
he
have
be
focus
on
artificial
intelligence
and
be
encourage
by
what
he
saw
all
the
basic
piece
be
in
place
he
say
sit
back
in
his
chair
with
his
right
foot
balance
on
his
left
knee
breitfeld
a
twenty
year
veteran
of
bmw
who
left
to
become
ceo
of
byton
hold
the
somewhat
contrarian
view
that
tesla
be
outdated
to
some
degree
tesla
be
some
kind
of
traditional
car
company
already
he
told
me
as
he
picked
at
a
fingernail
he
spoke
with
caffeinated
energy
his
german
accent
moderate
by
year
of
international
travel
even
the
model
left
him
unmoved
i
do
think
it
s
a
good
car
but
it
s
still
a
very
normal
car
breitfeld
promise
that
byton
fund
by
the
chinese
luxury
auto
retailer
china
harmony
new
energy
auto
chinese
internet
giant
tencent
electronics
manufacturer
foxconn
and
retail
conglomerate
sun
among
others
would
produce
something
much
more
advanced
than
any
of
tesla
s
vehicle
what
tesla
have
do
be
only
the
first
step
he
say
the
second
step
be
to
convert
the
car
into
an
intelligent
object
byton
s
car
will
include
a
digital
experience
for
every
passenger
and
connect
with
other
internet
service
to
personalize
the
mobility
experience
your
car
should
know
when
your
next
meeting
be
and
prepare
itself
for
your
commute
it
should
know
you
on
a
personal
level
like
a
whip
smart
chaperone
the
key
for
this
collect
data
on
a

that
compare
to

someone
told
me
if
you
don

maybe
those

be
the
one
in

the
idea
be
to

porsche
quality
by
combine
a
small
three
cylinder

with
a
zero

sixty

the
program
would
also
produce

which
could
travel
mile
per

breitfeld
instal
as

give
two
order
from
the
ceo
the
i
have
to
be
complete
within
three
year
and
it
have
to
be
of
outstanding
quality
breitfeld
have
to
figure
out
how
to
work
around
the
company
s
standard
operating
procedure
and
build
a
high
performance
team
which
would
work
at
a
site
independent
of
bmw
headquarters
as
the
program
progress
an
entrepreneurial
spirit
infuse
the
team
they
give
us
this
freedom
to
act
bypassing
all
the
process
this
create
a
lot
of
power
and
energy
but
others
in
the
company
be
dubious
breitfeld
s
colleague
told
him
he
be
crazy
what
do
you
do
they
ask
think
he
be
be
punish
for
some
unknown
transgression
this
will
never
work
others
conclude
after
a
year
breitfeld
s
team
have
come
up
with
a
prototype
for
the
i
it
be
ugly
but
it
work
with
kilowatt
of
power
on
the
front
axle
from
an
electric
motor
and
kilowatt
in
the
rear
from
an
internal
combustion
engine
this
prototype
even
if
it
be
do
very
quickly
and
not
refine
at
all
give
all
the
people
the
feel
wow
this
could
be
something
really
great
breitfeld
recall
others
in
the
company
start
to
take
more
of
an
interest
by
breitfeld
have
met
his
deadline
and
bmw
launch
the
i
during
a
weeklong
international
press
event
in
santa
monica
the
car
which
sport
door
that
open
almost
vertically
like
the
wing
of
a
butterfly
attract
immediate
interest
early
reviewer
refer
to
it
as
a
dream
machine
with
equal
part
sex
appeal
and
efficiency
both
the
i
and
i
have
garner
praise
since
despite
their
relatively
high
price
tag
the
former
cost
about
and
the
latter
and
by
bmw
standard
low
sale
number
these
day
seemingly
everyone
at
the
company
claim
to
have
be
involve
with
project
i
in
some
way
or
another
this
mean
success
breitfeld
joked
laugh
at
the
thought
however
within
bmw
the
i
and
the
i
be
see
as
niche
product
secondary
to
the
series
series
and
series
that
constitute
the
backbone
of
the
company
that
s
a
mentality
that
pervades
the
industry
breitfeld
say
they
re
do
too
many
car
right
now
with
the
old
technology
earn
a
lot
of
money
out
of
it
be
very
profitable
breitfeld
say
attack
the
car
portfolio
would
mean
that
customer
would
go
from
the
traditional
product
to
the
new
product
unfortunately
the
new
product
cost
more
to
make
and
deliver
slimmer
profit
they
be
struggle
very
much
to
do
this
transition
the
challenge
of
the
technology
shift
be
exacerbate
by
short
term
think
breitfeld
say
board
member
at
the
traditional
car
company
tend
to
have
three
to
five
year
contract
and
be
often
close
to
retirement
age
they
think
three
year
out
not
fifteen
they
re
concentrate
very
much
on
today
s
and
tomorrow
s
business
with
the
i
breitfeld
have
have
a
taste
of
the
future
and
want
more
he
imagine
what
a
company
would
look
like
if
it
combine
uber
s
ride
share
model
with
electric
propulsion
and
autonomous
drive
this
would
be
a
machine
to
print
money
he
say
break
into
a
smile
such
a
vision
couldn
t
be
realize
at
bmw
so
he
start
consider
other
option
he
be
approach
by
some
silicon
valley
tech
company
include
tesla
the
proposition
be
tempt
but
he
felt
tesla
be
lack
crucial
manufacturing
expertise
you
need
traditional
car
people
who
know
how
to
run
a
production
process
the
meeting
that
ultimately
lead
him
to
byton
take
place
while
he
be
on
vacation
at
lake
garda
in
italy
at
the
end
of
changge
feng
chairman
of
the
harmony
group
have
contact
breitfeld
to
see
if
he
would
be
interested
in
start
a
car
company
breitfeld
wasn
t
about
to
give
up
his
vacation
to
go
to
china
but
he
told
feng
he
would
give
him
ninety
minute
over
lunch
if
he
be
willing
to
meet
at
lake
garda
several
day
later
feng
and
three
associate
arrive
at
the
marina
where
breitfeld
s
yacht
be
moor
the
investor
arm
with
document
have
research
breitfeld
carefully
feng
be
empower
to
hire
him
on
the
spot
all
he
have
to
do
be
sign
on
the
dot
line
breitfeld
didn
t
want
to
move
so
quickly
not
only
be
he
not
entirely
convince
by
the
initial
sell
of
the
plan
but
he
also
wasn
t
excite
about
the
idea
of
move
to
china
the
basic
story
be
sexy
breitfeld
say
but
it
have
flaw
feng
seem
in
a
rush
you
can
start
today
and
we
will
go
to
market
at
the
end
of
next
year
he
told
breitfeld
the
german
respond
that
that
timeline
be
impossible
however
he
accepted
an
invitation
to
spend
a
long
weekend
in
china
for
more
in
depth
discussion
breitfeld
and
his
wife
be
living
in
munich
at
the
time
it
s
a
beautiful
city
an
easy
lifestyle
when
breitfeld
told
his
wife
that
he
be
go
to
china
for
the
meeting
she
assent
but
make
one
thing
clear
we
be
not
go
to
move
to
china
she
change
her
mind
once
she
saw
hong
kong
a
cosmopolitan
city
that
compare
favorably
even
to
munich
the
discussion
in
china
provide
more
substance
breitfeld
impressed
upon
the
investor
that
a
car
project
would
take
patience
and
a
lot
of
investment
they
would
need
to
spend
a
billion
dollar
before
they
could
hope
to
earn
a
dollar
back
also
they
would
have
to
push
back
their
launch
plan
this
be
an
internet
car
they
say
so
we
have
to
move
fast
yes
breitfeld
return
but
it
s
still
a
car
there
would
be
tool
test
homologation
these
thing
take
time
ultimately
breitfeld
be
push
over
the
edge
by
china
itself
he
recognize
the
emergence
of
an
entrepreneurial
culture
horde
of
people
in
their
late
twenty
full
of
optimism
and
brimming
with
entrepreneurial
passion
be
start
company
but
more
importantly
the
political
framework
be
right
it
s
the
best
in
the
world
breitfeld
say
matter
of
factly
the
market
be
large
the
middle
class
be
on
the
rise
and
the
government
be
commit
to
support
new
energy
vehicle
byton
would
be
sell
the
government
on
the
idea
that
autonomous
drive
add
value
to
society
it
reduces
accident
and
associate
injury
and
death
and
it
provide
private
mobility
option
for
the
elderly
among
other
benefit
the
company
would
set
up
a
test
environment
where
it
could
legally
demonstrate
the
technical
capability
of
autonomous
vehicle
it
plan
to
have
a
drivable
prototype
of
its
first
car
a
premium
suv
with
an
ipad
like
touch
screen
integrate
in
the
steer
wheel
ready
by
and
a
production
version
on
the
road
in
china
in
it
would
have
three
car
include
a
sedan
and
a
multipurpose
seven
seater
on
the
road
by
byton
aim
to
take
customer
not
as
much
from
fellow
electric
car
company
tesla
as
from
germany
s
premium
auto
brand
bmw
audi
and

it
have
announce
that

a
factory
in
the
eastern
chinese
city
of
nanjing
that
it
will
spend
billion
to
build
i
ask
breitfeld
if
there
be
other
people
like
him
who
be
still
at
traditional
automaker
but
want
to
try
something
new
he
point
out
that
he
have
hire
the
core
team
from
bmw
s
i
that
group
include
dirk
abendroth
who
developed
the

the

that

go
to

the
major

over
the

six

be
how
do
we
build

the

have
put
a
total
of
more
than
two
hundred

it
be
still
a
niche
automaker
to
reach
mass
market
scale
it
would
have
to
produce
many
more

faster
ultimately
pump
out
half
a
million
model
s
a
year
by

it

to

five
thousand

more
than
double
its
midyear
production
rate
and
it
hop
to
hit
ten
thousand
a

at
some
point
in
frankly
we

go

welcome
to

hell
it
be
a
term
musk
have
use
before
and
it
refer
to
something
that
the
company
s
detractor
felt
could
be
its
downfall
tesla
might
be
able
to
make
a
small
number
of
expensive
car
the
argument
go
but
it
can
t
be
a
serious
challenger
to
the
traditional
auto
giant
until
it
can
handle
the

of

such
critic
haven
t
have
to
look
hard

find
evidence
to

their
case
for

by

own
admission
difficulty
with
the

time

not
close
properly
musk
confess
to
hubris
in
add
far
too
much
new
technology
to
the

later
say
he
have
be
spending

at

basically
we

at
the

event
he
emphasize
that
the
new
car
be
engineer
to
be
easy
to
build
keep
it
simple
tesla
initially
offer
only
two
variant
a
standard

with
mile
of
range
and
a
long
range
option
that
would
drive
mile
per

but
indeed
tesla
face
early
challenge
in
manufacturing
the
model
in
august
musk
have
confidently
predict
the
company
would
be
produce
model
s
by
the
ten
of
thousand
per
week
by
the
end
of

a
bottleneck
in
battery
module
production
from
the
gigafactory
lead
him
to
temper
that
goal
considerably
instead
tesla
set
its
sight
on
a
five
thousand
per
week
production
rate
by
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
in
later
adjust
to
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
musk
say
that
model
reservation
holder
should
assume
the
bad
in
term
of
possible
delivery
date
for
their
vehicle
mass
market
manufacturing
however
be
just
one
of
many
challenge
tesla
must
overcome
to
find
long
term
success
it
be
a
company
that
continually
push
itself
to
the
limit
try
to
take
on
with
thirty
thousand
employee
what
many
much
large
company
would
never
consider
attempt
after
all
tesla
s
ambition
doesn
t
stop
at
the
model
it
s
also
building
a
global
network
of
supercharger
several
massive
battery
factory
and
a
retail
network
that
reach
to
all
part
of
the
planet
its
solarcity
acquisition
brought
not
only
financial
complication
the
young
company
have
lose
more
than
million
in
the
first
three
quarter
of
when
tesla
offer
to
buy
it
for
billion
but
also
a
range
of
new
product
to
learn
and
sell
from
solar
panel
to
solar
shingle
at
the
same
time
musk
have
say
tesla
will
make
semitrucks
pickup
truck
minibus
a
next
generation
roadster
and
a

all
this
remember
while
not

profitability
could
be
a
stick
point
for
a
while
musk
seem
much
more
interested
in
go
for
a
big
long
term
win
than
in
chase
short
term
profit
to
mollify
shareholder
tesla
continue
to
invest
heavily
in
massive
project
include
the
gigafactory
model
development
its
semitruck
and
energy
storage
system
and
it
keep
go
back
to

and
lender
in
search
of
more
capital
to
fund
its
ambitious
expansion
plan
the
result
sometimes
make
financially
mind
observer
nervous
even
if
those
anxiety
aren

always
reflect
in
the
stock

jim
chanos
a
short
seller
famous
for
bet
against
enron
just
ahead
of
its
collapse
have
say
that
tesla
be
head
for
a
brick
wall
and
that
it
will
struggle
to
appeal
to
customer
now
that
traditional
automaker
be
also
make
sexy
electric
car
tesla
s
big
asset
be
its
stock
price
he
say
when
it
fall
it
will
really
fall
in
late
ubs
calculate
that
if
tesla
continued
to
burn
cash
at
its
then
current
rate
more
than
a
billion
dollar
a
quarter
it
would
run
out
of
money
in
and
yet
tesla
have
repeatedly
demonstrate
an
ability
to
raise
fund
through
creative
mean
such
as
accept
preorder
deposit
for
its
truck
for
a
reservation
and
the
new
roadster
for
which
the
company
asks
buyer
of
the
founder
series
to
front
with
buyer
of
the
standard
version
of
the
new
roadster
which
tesla
say
will
accelerate
from
zero
to
sixty
mile
per
hour
in
under
two
second
have
to
pay
up
front
these
deposit
be
worth
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
to
tesla
but
it
be
likely
that
the
company
will
also
need
to
raise
money
through
other
mean
such
as
a
stock
sale
or
far
debt
offering
before
it
can
get
to
profitability
if
model
sale
be
slow
or
the
economy
take
a
turn
for
the
bad
the
company
could
find
itself
in
serious
financial
trouble
but
even
then
there
s
a
fair
chance
that
it
won
t
be
too
difficult
for
musk
who
have
a
legion
of
fan
in
finance
tech
and
beyond
to
find
willing
financier
to
keep
the

company
in
business
personnel
issue
be
another
of
the
threat
that

musk
have
defend
tesla

record

see
many
senior

short
in

the

suffer
from

that

and
chris
lattner
formerly

who
come
to
the
mutual
agreement
with
tesla
that
he
wasn
t
a
good
fit
now
that
traditional
automaker
be
invest
more
heavily
in
electric
car
and
new
entrant
like
vacuum
cleaner
maker
dyson
and
india
s
tata
motor
be
aggressively
push
into
the

tesla
will
have
to
work
hard
to
attract
and
retain
the
talent
it
need
to
stay
ahead
of
the
competition
and
that
s
to
say
nothing
of
the
most
important
worker
at
the
company
musk
himself
it
be
impossible
not
to
wonder
about
his
store
of
energy
and
ability
to
focus
on
the
momentous
challenge
ahead
not
only
be
he
call
the
shot
at
tesla
but
he
s
also
run
spacex
a
billion
enterprise
with
more
than
a
few
ambition
of
its
own
which
include
send
astronaut
to
the
international
space
station
a
space
internet
subdivision
drive
the
development
of
cheap
reusable
rocket
and
ultimately
colonize
mar
as
if
he
be
somehow
bore
by
this
trifle
workload
musk
have
also
take
on
a
host
of
other
side
project
such
as
neuralink
a
brain
computer
interface
start
up
he
cofounded
the
boring
company
which
plan
to
make
tunnel
for
car
and
the
hyperloop
another
of
his
pet
interest
can
he
do
it
all
the
job
juggling
certainly
come
with
pressure
on
july
musk
publish
a
series
of
tweet
that
almost
amount
to
a
psychological
confessional
respond
to
a
fan
who
tweet
that
musk
s
instagram
account
show
an
amaze
life
the
ceo
write
the
reality
be
great
high
terrible
low
and
unrelenting
stress
a
separate
twitter
user
ask
if
musk
be
bipolar
yeah
musk
reply
then
he
add
detail
with
more
tweet
july
a
m
maybe
not
medically
tho
dunno
bad
feeling
correlate
to
bad
event
so
maybe
real
problem
be
get
carry
away
in
what
i
sign
up
for
july
a
m
if
you
buy
a
ticket
to
hell
it
isn
t
fair
to
blame
hell
july
a
m
i
m
sure
there
be
well
answer
than
what
i
do
which
be
just
take
the
pain
and
make
sure
you
really
care
about
what
you
re
do
another
indication
of
the
emotional
toll
of
these
endeavor
be
capture
in
a
interview
on
danish
television
be
you
a
little
naive
when
you
thought
i
can
easily
build
an
electric
car
and
a
rocket
the
interviewer
ask
musk
i
didn
t
think
it
d
be
easy
musk
reply
i
guess
that
i
thought
they
d
probably
fail
but
you
know
like
create
a
company
be
almost
like
have
a
child
so
it
s
sort
of
like
how
do
you
say
your
child
should
not
have
food
his
eye
take
on
a
sheen
the
interviewer
continued
so
once
you
have
the
company
you
have
to
feed
it
and
nurse
it
and
take
care
of
it
even
if
it
ruin
you
yeah
musk
reply
his
lip
start
quiver
and

series
the
german
automaker
s
bestselling
car
for
decade
the
model
be
to
the
series
what
the
iphone
be
to
the
blackberry
there
s
no
key
for
the

just
a
bluetooth
connection
through
a

that
unlocks
the
door
when
you
approach
there
be
no
knob
or

on
the

all
of
the

reside
in
a
fifteen
inch
touch

mount
horizontally
above
the

the

emanates
from
a

continuous

that
run
the
length
of

can
be
divert
to
various
part
of

around

of

software
can
do
most
of
the
drive
as
drew
to
a
close
i
have
a
chance
to
drive
the
car
not
long
after
i
have
test
driven
the
chevy
bolt
there
be
no
comparison
i
have
spent
plenty
of
time
in
a
model
s
and
a
model
x
but
sit
behind
the
wheel
of
the
model
immediately
give
me
the
sense
that
i
be
in
a
next
level
family
car
it
felt
like
a
small
version
of
the
model
s
which
be
a
good
thing
because
the
large
sedan
verge
on
too
wide
and
muscular
for
my
like
but
it
still
have
plenty
of
room
at
one
point
we
packed
in
four
adult
and
a
baby
in
a
child
seat
with
no
complaint
from
any
of
the
occupant
the
power
underfoot
still
felt
immense
and
instantaneous
even
though
its
zero
to
sixty
time
be
closer
to
five
second
than
the
model
s
s
three
and
the
cabin
free
from
the
clutter
characteristic
of
normal
car
felt
like
something
design
for
today
s
consumer
it
be
the
closest
thing
to
an
apple
product
that
exists
on
four
wheel
like
the
iphone
the
model
be
more
expensive
than
what
many
of
its
owner
would
have
paid
for
a
product
in
its
class
before
it
come
along
but
also
like
the
iphone
it
be
so
different
from
what
have
come
before
that
people
get
the
sense
that
they
re
buying
more
than
just
a
product
they
re
buying
magic
if
tesla
can
make
the
model
in
anything
like
the
number
it
have
promise
the
car
stand
to
bring
the
company
what
the
iphone
brought
apple
an
explosion
of
sale
and
a
product
that
reshapes
an
industry
one
night
in
the
summer
of
my
wife
and
i
be
drive
our
honda
when
we
be
sideswipe
by
a
volkswagen
that
have
butt
into
our
lane
the
damage
be
slight
but
it
be
expensive
enough
that
the
insurance
company
decide
that
the
old
vehicle
be
a
write
off
we
consider
replace
it
with
a
honda
fit
or
toyota
prius
but
ultimately
decide
to
go
carless
for
at
least
a
few
month
we
have
place
a
reservation
for
a
model
and
hop
that
our
financial
situation
would
improve
to
the
point
where
we
could
pay
for
the
car
when
it
become
available
perhaps
in
early
it
s
my
hope
that
the
model
will
be
the
family
car
that
our
son
will
grow
up
with
we
have
no
intention
of
ever
again
buying
a
gasoline
vehicle
which
mean
he
could
experience
transport
power
by
the
internal
combustion
engine
only
in
rare
circumstance
in
each
case
it
will
seem
to
him
like
step
back
into
another
era
like
kid
today
encounter
rotary
dial
telephone
by
the
time
he
be
an
adult
i
hope
he
will
look
back
on
this
time
and
wonder
why
anyone
get
so
work
up
about
oil
and
how
anyone
doubt
its
period
of
dominance
could
ever
end

catch
a
ride
to
the
renaissance
the
trend
here
be
irreversible
i
sat

in

they

without
slow
sudden
evasive
action

another
defensive

on
these

slowly
forward

impertinent
honk

from
somewhere
behind

profound
and

of

by

message
to

intel
be
a
company
of
destiny
wu
recall
malone
say

that
destiny

only
be
yours
if
you
continue
to
take
risk
the
future
malone
told
the

be
theirs
for
the
take
if
you
be
too
careful
you
will
fail
reflect
on
his
own
life
wu
conclude
that
he
have
become
too
conservative
why
have
he
stayed
at
one
company
for
so
long
his
father
who
be
never
successful
in
his
multiple
attempt
to
start
his
own
company
have
taught
him
to
be
unafraid
of
failure
this
be
an
unusual
message
for
a
chinese
parent
to
deliver
in
a
society
that
tends
to
prize
conventional
career
path
and
job
security
wu
saw
that
his
father
whom
he
much
admire
have
be
happy
despite
the
disappointment
in
business
from
this
he
take
strength
failure
be
nothing
wu
say
he
learn
from
his
dad
if
you
have
your
dream
if
you
have
your
faith
failure
cannot
beat
you
wu

carefully
always
support

with
number
it
be
he
who
told
me
the

also
list
a
series
of
other
fact

increasingly
interested

at
the
time

industry
be
ripe
for
reformatting
in
the
last
century
the
automobile
industry
actually
hasn
t
change
a
lot
he
say
two
people
on
a
moped
no

swept
by
he
have
read
that
there
be
more
than
auto
company
worldwide
in
the
early
s
but
that
there
be
now
only
about
fourteen
depend
on
how
you
count
the
consolidated
entity
electric
vehicle
however
have
change
the
whole
situation
the
number
of
component
in
an
automobile
could
be
drastically
reduce
and
the
value
chain
be
change
significantly
new
competitor
have
a
well
chance
than
ever
for
the
last
century
wu
say
the
auto
industry
have
be
like
boxing
dominate
by
big
guy
who
follow
well
define
rule
but
now
it
be
like
mixed

which
favor
scrappy
nimble
fighter
even
if
they
re
small
the
rule
become
very
complicate
or
people
don
t
follow
rule
meanwhile
ride
share
have
become
popular
lead
in
china
by
didi
chuxing
connectivity
provide
an
opportunity
to
make
car
more
like
mobile
phone
and
the
idea
of
autonomous
drive
be
gain
momentum
with
baidu

online
search

i
start
to

a
little
nauseous
it
wasn
t
only
because
i
be
focus
my
attention
on
wu
instead
of
the

but
also
because
the
driver
like
many
in
china
be
unkind
to
the

it
be
degree
fahrenheit
outside

we

open
my

the

slow
and
the

from

he
say
there
would
be
two
type
of
car
in
china
one
would
be
a
high

passenger
car
that
emphasize
safety
the
other
would
be
a
low

urban
commuter
not
sell
to
consumer
but
available
on
demand
via
a
smartphone
app
these
robotaxis
would
have
a
top
speed
of
forty
mile
an
hour
and
would
be
able
to
communicate
with
each
other
to
drastically
improve
traffic
flow
in
ten
year
we
would
see
million
of
such
robotaxis
on
the
road
wu
predict
a
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
study
have
show
that
ride
share
and
car
share
could
reduce
the
number
of
car
on
the
road
by
percent
he
believe
that
there
would
be
three
million
car
in
beijing
by
half
as
many
as
there
be
in
of
which
two
million
would
be
robotaxis
as
i
talk

wu
there
be
only
about
seventy
thousand
taxi
in
the

for
a
population
of
twenty

it
be
hard
to
get

wu
pull
a
fifteen
inch
powerbook
from
his

with
the

on

he
brought
up
a

show

represent
as

against
a

steadily
through
an

without
the
need
for

light
the
hypothetical
car
be
communicate
with
each
other
so
they
knew
when
to
slow
down
when
to
yield
for
others
and
when
to
speed
up
again
in
another

wu
show
how
sudden
brake
cause
traffic
jam
when
a
white
rectangle
on
the

suddenly
halt
its

motion
it
sent
a

wave
out

behind
it
each

autonomous

they

everyone

uisee
trialed

for

passenger
at

guangzhou
in

china
could
certainly
use
self
drive
car
more
than
seven
hundred
people
be
kill
on
its

a

accord
to
the

health
organization
in
a

interview
two
day
before
i
met
wu
wang
jing
the
head
of
baidu
s
autonomous
drive
unit
say
baidu
believe
self
drive
car
could
reduce
the
death
toll
on
china
s
road
by
percent
since
that
s
the
proportion
of
accident
cause
by
human
error
self
drive
car
would
also
save
time
wang
say
a
commute
in
a
megacity
like
beijing
or
shanghai
commonly
take
an
hour
or
two
but
most
car
on
the
road
have
only
one
occupant
a
more
efficient
distribution
of
body
per
vehicle
through
ride
share
would
improve
traffic
and
speed
up
commute
in
china
it
will
be
easy
than
in
the
united
state
for
people
to
make
the
transition
to
share
self
drive
car
wang
reason
the
population
density
of
the
big
city
make
it
difficult
for
people
to
have
access
to
their
own
parking
space
and
hundred
of
million
of
chinese
still
don
t
own
car
for
chinese
people
they
don
t
have
this
concept
they
haven
t
completely
embrace
the
private
car
yet
wang
say
so
it
s
easy
for
them
to
embrace
the
autonomous
drive
car
with
the
car
share
he
also
argue
that
china
provide
the
ideal
test
condition
for
autonomous
vehicle
because
the
road
be
so
crowd
and
drive
behavior
be
so
erratic
present
a
panoply
of
challenge
for
the
car
supercomputer
to
contend
with
and
ultimately
overcome
technically
if
you
can
make
it
work
in
china
you
can
make
it
work
anywhere
a
day
before
my
call
with
wang
baidu
have
announce
a
partnership
with
wuhu
a
city
of
nearly
four
million
people
in
anhui
province
to
start
a
self
drive
car
pilot
program
in
the
central
city
for
the
first
three
year
self
drive
car
van
and
bus
would
be
introduce
to
downtown
area
purely
for
test
beyond
three
year
the
plan
be
to
start
commercialize
the
program
and
allow
passenger
in
the
vehicle
ultimately
the
program
would
spread
across
the
whole
city
wang
cite
wuhu
as
an
example
of
how
regulation
in
china
might
actually
work
in
favor
of
autonomous
vehicle
the
city
government
be
very
enthusiastic
about
the
project
he
say
and
besides
even
if
government
be
slow
to
embrace
the
technology
the
advent
of
self
drive
car
be
inevitable
that
s
the
mega
trend
it
s
definitely
come
in
wang
s
opinion
software
will
be
the
most
important
car
spec
of
the
future
today
we
ob
over
a
car
s
engine
size
acceleration
time
or
fuel
economy
but
that
s
go
to
change
in
the
future
we
ll
want
to
know
whether
our
car
can
communicate
with
the
traffic
system
other
car
or
even
the
road
itself
we
ll
want
to
know
how
far
ahead
our
car
can
see
so
we
can
ass
how
safe
it
be
we
ll
want
to
know
what
its
drive
pattern
be
like
how
smooth
a
ride
it
can
offer
these
concept
wang
reason
be
similar
to
how
we
ass
smartphones
today
the
software
that
the
phone
be
run
io
or
android
matter
more
to
many
consumer
than
the

or
central

unit
in
the
united

tesla
s
jb
straubel
share
wang
s
view
autonomous
vehicle
be
mostly
define
by
the
software
that
operates
them
straubel
say
at
a
conference
in
the
improvement
happen
in
the
field
be
phenomenal
we
can
literally
measure
them
in
month
instead
of
year
tesla
be
pay
special
attention
to
image
recognition
straubel
say
the
trend
here
be
irreversible
we
re
not
go
to
see
them
slow
down
or
stop

in
the
summer
of
a
friend
picked
me
up
for
a
ride
in
a
tesla
model
x
the
first
time
i
have
be
in
the
car
on
the
highway
just
south
of
san
francisco
he
put
it
into
autopilot
mode
and
take
his
hand
off
the
steer
wheel
even
though
i
have
read
all
about
the
technology
and
have
see
it
on
video
i
still
instinctively
flinch
as
soon
as
he
do
it
i
want
to
reach
over
and
guide
the
car
myself
i
be
perturbed
that
even
as
car
speed
along
beside
us
the
model
x
do
not
slow
down
if
anything
it
felt
like
it
speed
up
the
car
drove
itself
at
the
speed
limit
sixty
five
mile
an
hour
and
stayed
glue
to
its
lane
with
equidistant
clearance
on
either
side
it
take
about
twenty
second
for
my
breathing
to
return
to
normal
still
i
kept
one
eye
on
the
road
and
one
on
the
wheel
then
just
as
i
be
calm
down
my
friend
flip
on
the
turn
signal
and
the
car
quickly
but
smoothly
guide
itself
into
the
lane
to
the
right
maintain
a
safe
distance
from
other
car
do
you
trust
it
i
ask
my
friend
yeah
i
do
he
say
with
little
hesitation
he
d
driven
with
autopilot
many
time
by
then
it
didn
t
seem
like
a
big
deal
to
him
anymore
it
s
especially
useful
in
stop
and
go
traffic
when
i
m
commute
it
s
such
a
big
help
in
reduce
the
tedium
and
not
have
to
think
about
what
my
hand
and
foot
be
do
every
second
our
ai
guide
drive
quickly
get
boring
we
be
soon
talk
to
each
other
about
other
thing
and
the
car
s
activity
become
background
i
didn
t
feel
at
risk
and
i
didn
t
feel
safer
when
after
a
couple
of
minute
my
friend
retook
the
wheel
it
be
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
the
concept
of
a
car
that
drive
itself
will
one
day
seem
unremarkable
at
the
time
tesla
s
autopilot
system
be
classify
as
level
autonomy
meaning
the
car
could
keep
itself
in
a
lane
change
lane
and
modulate
speed
accord
to
traffic
condition
but
that
a
human
driver
still
have
to
be
present
attentive
and
ready
to
take
over
at
any
moment
the
national
highway
traffic
safety
administration
have
establish
a
framework
for
categorization
that
be
base
on
six
level
level
be
the
low
meaning
that
a
human
have
complete
control
with
no
computer
assistance
while
for
level
the
car
have
some
advanced
driver
assistance
technology
such
as
automatic
emergency
brake
but
the
driver
still
control
the
vehicle
at
all
time
level
be
the
high
at
which
a
car
would
have
no
control
for

the

go

rather

a

such
as

the
absence

too
open
up
more
design
possibility
for

so
autonomous

could
come
in

size
as
small
as
a

to

that
the

they
depend

the

that
the

in

tesla
say
that

that

allow

at

in

the

a

penetration
come
by
in
bad

it
s
harder
for
an

to
make
out
marking
on
the

and
see
other

in

them
snow

can
cover
the

block
their

many

on

which
can
be
accurate
to

and
help

anticipate

however
such
map
will
take

to
build
out
and
they
age
quickly
as

condition
change

suggest
that
universal

data
that
can
be
share
across

fleet
and
update
in
real
time
will
be
necessary
for
the
self

era
but
you
can
bet
that
it
will
take
some
time
for
the
various
stakeholder
to
agree
on
a
coherent
plan
for
such
cooperation
car
will
also
need
steady
reliable

fast
wireless

so
they
can
communicate
with

other

such
as

even

that
effort
will
be
help
by
the
advent
of
the
g
wireless
standard

that
likely
won

after

be
when
intel

also
likely
slow
down

the

a
key

will
center
on
the

engender
a

maybe
our

will

up

perhaps
the

i
know
about
the
renaissance
the
period
in
european
history
from
the
fourteenth
to
the
seventeenth
century
come
from
an
eighteen
minute
youtube
video
produce
by
the
author
and
philosophy
guru
alain
de
botton
s
school
of
life
de
botton
dedicates
a
few
minute
of
the
video
to
educate
viewer
about
the
renaissance
leader
zeal
for
building
beautiful
city
you
can
count
on
one
hand
the
number
of
city
built
since
the
s
that
can
rival
the
elegance
of
city
that
sprung
up
on
the
italian
peninsula
during
the
three
hundred
odd
year
of
the
renaissance
de
botton
say
in
the
video
sure
he
concedes
the
old
urban
planner
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
car
or
zone
law
but
they
have
a
mission
and
be
extremely
direct
and
didactic
in
carry
it
out
city
father
across
the
italian
peninsula
have
fall
in
love
with
a
remarkable
new
idea
that
their
city
should
be
the
focus
of
an
unparalleled
attention
to
beauty
he
say
it
s
slightly
embarrass
to
contrast
these
effort
with
our
own
de
botton
argues
that
successful
city
planning
be
never
an
accident
the
renaissance
produce
great
city
because
its
leader
believe
that
people
be
to
a
large
extent
shape
by
the
building
around
them
i
be
remind
of
this
comment
when
i
walk
the
street
of
san
francisco
a
boomtown
that
rank
tenth
in
the
world
for
number
of
billionaire
and
must
carefully
avoid
schmear
of
human
excrement
on
the
sidewalk
make
sure
that
the
public
realm
conveys
dignity
and
calm
be
more
than
a
luxury
de
botton
say
it
can
help
to
ensure
the
sanity
vigor
and
happiness
of
a
whole
population
the
renaissance
leader
embrace
the
idea
that
the
public
sphere
should
be
beautiful
refine
and
appeal
so
that
a
society
s
richer
citizen
would
never
be
tempt
to
withdraw
into
their
private
estate
close
off
from
the
world
around
them
all
citizen
could
then
be
uplifted
by
a
please
vision
of
communal
life
it
be
when
henry
ford
unveiled
the
first
model
t
a
product
that
would
reorient
the
infrastructure
of
civilization
and
around
which
civilization
would
reorient
itself
just
over
a
century
later
elon
musk
unveiled
the
model
s
at
a
time
when
civilization
be
more
than
ready
for
a
cultural
rebirth
one
that
could
be
catalyze
by
something
as
innocuous
as
a
beautiful
car
that
drive
itself
autonomy
after
all
be
a
term
not
limited
to
the
automatic
control
of
a
motor
vehicle
its
meaning
also
speaks
of
self
determination
it
be
through
the
power
of
this
autonomy
that
we
can
turn
a
revolution
into
a
renaissance
