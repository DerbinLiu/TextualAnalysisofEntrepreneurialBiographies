that
lead
to
this
glorious
day
take
place
in
those
anxious
time
of
but
the
story
have
its
origin
at
least
two
and
a
half
year
earlier
on
january
i
be
name
pfizer
s
chief
operating
officer
a
position
that
would
give
me
one
year
to
prepare
for
an
eventual
transition
to
the
top
my
focus
be
growth
and
my
motto
be
that
growth
never
just
happens
it
be
create
and
in
our
industry
the
only
way
to
drive
growth
be
by
create
a
meaningful
positive
impact
on
the
life
of
patient
for
that
we
have
to
transform
pfizer
into
a
patient
centric
organization
focus
on
science
and
innovation
i
be
an
optimist
perhaps
because
my
mother
s
brave
and
narrow
escape
from
death
minute
after
be
line
up
against
a
wall
in
front
of
a
nazi
fire
squad
during
the
holocaust
make
me
believe
that
nothing
be
impossible
but
my
optimism
for
the
new
pfizer
i
be
about
to
lead
be
ground
on
a
strong
foundation
during
the
past
nine
year
my
predecessor
ian
read
a
man
of
strong
conviction
from
whom
i
learn
a
lot
have
turn
around
our
research
and
development
r
d
engine
from
an
organization
of
mediocre
productivity
to
that
of
an
industry
leader
that
give
me
confidence
to
think
really
big
about
what
to
do
to
transform
pfizer
and
move
really
fast
with
execute
my
plan
in
the
twelve
month
that
follow
before
i
become
chief
executive
officer
i
developed
the
strategy
design
the
organization
and
decide
on
the
executive
team
that
would
join
me
in
our
transformational
journey
on
the
day
i
be
name
ceo
i
knew
exactly
what
i
want
to
do
that
day
the
pfizer
board
of
director
call
me
into
a
conference
room
in
a
california
hotel
to
confirm
my
appointment
i
thanked
them
smile
and
say
aloud
only
in
america
only
in
america
could
a
greek
immigrant
with
a
thick
accent
become
ceo
of
one
of
the
world
s
big
corporation
immediately
after
take
over
the
rein
i
initiate
the
most
dramatic
transformation
in
the
history
of
our
company
within
month
i
reorganize
the
portfolio
of
our
corporate
business
we
found
well
home
outside
pfizer
for
our
consumer
healthcare
and
upjohn
off
patent
business
those
two
business
be
big
in
they
account
for
over
percent
of
our
total
revenue
but
the
first
have
low
market
share
and
the
second
be
decline
in
both
case
the
new
home
be
offering
strong
and
brighter
prospect
for
these
business
than
if
they
be
to
remain
inside
pfizer
our
consumer
healthcare
business
be
merge
with
glaxosmithkline
s
consumer
healthcare
business
in
a
joint
venture
that
create
the
large
and
best
over
the
counter
company
in
the
world
our
upjohn
business
be
merge
with
mylan
to
form
viatris
the
large
and
best
specialty
generic
drug
company
in
the
world
the
separation
be
not
easy
some
member
of
my
team
become
concerned
with
let
that
much
revenue
go
we
will
not
be
the
big
anymore
someone
say
we
should
not
aim
to
be
the
big
we
should
aim
to
be
the
best
i
reply
a
good
gardener
need
to
prune
the
tree
when
spring
start
i
told
a
reporter
pfizer
be
in
the
spring
of
high
growth
little
do
we
know
at
the
time
that
by
let
these
two
predictable
but
slow
grow
business
go
and
focus
solely
on
our
innovative
core
we
d
position
ourselves
two
year
later
to
deliver
a
vaccine
to
curb
a
global
pandemic
while
reemerging
as
the
big
pharmaceutical
company
in
the
world
in
addition
to
the
worry
about
size
there
be
a
lot
of
emotional
concern
some
of
the
most
iconic
brand
that
make
pfizer
famous
be
part
of
those
two
business
advil
centrum
lipitor
norvasc
viagra
just
to
mention
a
few
it
felt
that
we
be
separate
ourselves
from
our
big
success
but
i
knew
that
what
make
a
good
company
great
be
its
ability
to
optimize
its
own
success
and
turn
the
page
to
new
and
well
horizon
of
fame
at
the
same
time
that
we
be
reduce
the
size
of
the
company
we
invest
billion
of
dollar
to
strengthen
our
scientific
capability
and
pipeline
asset
within
month
we
acquire
four
biotech
company
among
them
be
array
a
colorado
biotech
firm
with
a
reputation
for
make
druggable
the
undruggable
these
company
come
with
more
expense
than
revenue
but
be
help
us
build
a
position
of
scientific
strength
additionally
we
start
building
new
capability
for
example
the
first
day
i
start
as
ceo
i
appoint
lidia
fonseca
as
pfizer
s
first
chief
digital
officer
reporting
to
me
lidia
who
be
born
in
mexico
emigrate
to
the
united
state
as
a
child
and
receive
her
master
s
degree
in
the
netherlands
have
a
passion
for
how
digital
solution
can
improve
health
outcome
she
join
us
from
quest
diagnostics
and
be
an
experienced
change
agent
one
of
the
first
priority
i
give
her
be
to
digitize
research
and
development
allow
for
great
collaboration
transparency
and
speed
but
all
these
move
be
cost
a
lot
of
money
and
to
support
this
new
direction
we
have
to
do
a
radical
reallocation
of
capital
the
r
d
and
digital
budget
be
increase
drastically
to
offset
this
we
take
draconian
measure
to
reduce
marketing
and
administrative
expense
six
month
after
my
appointment
as
ceo
pfizer
have
be
transform
from
a
conglomerate
of
business
to
a
company
singularly
focus
on
scientific
innovation
i
knew
that
a
business
transformation
of
that
magnitude
could
not
be
complete
by
just
change
the
portfolio
of
business
or
the
allocation
of
capital
to
be
successful
we
would
have
to
change
the
company
s
culture
we
would
need
to
become
a
company
more
comfortable
with
risk
and
driven
to
achieve
bold
move
to
live
up
to
our
purpose
and
its
promise
to
patient
with
an
age
global
population
that
be
become
increasingly
urbanized
it
become
clear
to
me
that
the
demand
for
new
breakthrough
medical
solution
will
continue
to
grow
we
need
a
culture
that
could
foster
innovation
by
think
big
and
out
of
the
box
with
the
cost
of
healthcare
delivery
also
grow
healthcare
disparity
could
become
an
even
big
issue
we
need
a
culture
of
great
sensitivity
to
the
need
of
society
and
a
dedication
to
a
high
purpose
but
a
new
culture
be
not
something
you
can
create
in
a
vacuum
you
cannot
ask
a
consultant
of
a
business
school
to
suggest
to
you
the
best
business
culture
so
you
can
choose
the
win
culture
for
an
organization
depends
on
its
legacy
the
institutional
memory
of
its
failure
and
success
the
challenge
and
opportunity
in
the
decade
ahead
the
environment
and
many
other
factor
you
need
to
ass
all
these
piece
of
the
puzzle
and
design
your
own
win
culture
just
two
week
after
i
become
ceo
the
top
one
thousand
pfizer
leader
from
around
the
world
gather
in
florida
to
discus
debate
and
determine
what
a
new
pfizer
would
look
like
when
we
left
there
be
no
doubt
about
our
purpose
we
exist
because
society
need
require
us
to
deliver
breakthrough
that
change
patient
life
we
have
debate
a
lot
if
we
should
use
the
word
medicine
or
vaccine
but
we
decide
to
go
with
breakthrough
because
it
be
broader
and
more
powerful
with
the
line
between
technology
become
blur
speak
only
about
medicine
or
vaccine
seem
very
restrictive
and
no
longer
reflect
the
reality
of
the
new
decade
of
scientific
inquiry
just
a
few
month
later
we
also
launch
an
effort
to
introduce
pfizer
s
new
culture
to
our
employee
and
the
world
in
four
simple
word
courage
breakthrough
start
by
challenge
convention
especially
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
or
adversity
this
happens
when
we
think
big
speak
up
and
be
decisive
excellence
we
can
only
change
patient
life
when
we
perform
at
our
best
together
this
happens
when
we
focus
on
what
matter
agree
on
who
do
what
and
measure
outcome
equity
every
person
deserves
to
be
see
heard
and
care
for
this
happens
when
we
be
inclusive
act
with
integrity
and
reduce
healthcare
disparity
joy
we
give
ourselves
to
our
work
and
it
also
give
to
us
we
find
joy
when
we
take
pride
recognize
one
another
and
have
fun
of
course
no
one
could
imagine
in
january
when
we
spoke
about
breakthrough
that
change
patient
life
that
within
two
year
our
company
s
change
would
in
turn
change
so
much
the
life
of
so
many
we
would
develop
the
world
s
first
safe
and
effective
vaccine
to
be
approve
in
multiple
country
against
the
global
pandemic
we
succeed
not
because
we
be
lucky
we
succeed
because
we
be
prepared
the
people
of
pfizer
learn
in
those
precede
year
that
have
the
courage
to
think
big
and
make
tough
counterintuitive
decision
be
not
only
allow
but
expect
that
excellence
in
execution
be
not
about
us
but
about
serve
patient
that
equity
and
reduction
of
healthcare
disparity
be
not
the
concern
of
the
others
but
an
important
part
of
our
purpose
and
that
the
good
we
bring
to
the
world
should
spark
our
joy
pride
and
passionate
dedication
to
our
purpose
courage
excellence
equity
joy
these
powerful
word
become
part
of
our
life
at
pfizer
and
prepared
us
for
the
challenge
ahead
the
idea
of
a
moonshot
be
resurgent
today
the
term
s
first
know
use
be
in
when
american
contemplate
space
exploration
coincidentally
this
be
also
a
time
of
great
progress
in
vaccine
development
with
the
combination
of
diphtheria
tetanus
and
pertussis
in
one
dtp
vaccine
a
polio
vaccine
be
in
use
a
few
year
later
by
but
the
idea
of
a
moonshot
enter
the
lexicon
for
good
in
the
s
when
president
kennedy
pledge
that
man
would
fly
to
the
moon
and
return
safely
to
earth
kennedy
say
he
chose
the
moon
not
because
it
be
easy
but
because
it
be
hard
because
that
goal
will
serve
to
organize
and
measure
the
best
of
our
energy
and
skill
because
that
challenge
be
one
that
we
be
willing
to
accept
one
we
be
unwilling
to
postpone
and
one
which
we
intend
to
win

indeed
a

with
the
trump
administration
much
of
our
deliberation
up
to
that
point
have
focus
on
develop
therapeutic
that
would
help
keep
patient
alive
but
what
about
a
vaccine
that
would
prevent
people
from
get
the
virus
in
the
first
place
in
other
word
would
we
point
our
resource
toward
a
treatment
or
a
prevention
in
the
context
of
covid
a
treatment
alone
wouldn
t
end
the
pandemic
a
vaccine
could
a
june
paper
from
vaccine
europe
cite
vaccination
as
one
of
the
most
cost
effective
public
health
intervention
ever
implement
and
make
the
point
that
childhood

medical
success
story
of
the
th
century
accord

apart
from

vaccine
have
have
the
most
profound
impact
on

this
be
the
reason
why
when
i

i
significantly
increase
the
investment
in

research
on
that
call
mikael
and
i
agree
that
this
virus
be
different
and
we
warm
to
the
idea
of
pursue
a
vaccine
first
one
aspect
that
distinguishes
pfizer
s
vaccine
make
capability
be
that
we
be
highly
integrate
end
to
end
from
early
research
to
late

premier
vaccinology
team
lead
by
a
tough
courageous
german

result
we
have
an
ace
up

his
turn
to
speak
mikael
told
the
president
it
s
not
just
one
solution

we
should
offer
multiple
approach
therapeutic
and
vaccine
he
say
that
pfizer
be
already
advance
a
therapeutic
option
and
dedicate
all
resource
necessary
to
pursue
a
vaccine
at
the
same
time
with
a
thirty
thousand
person
team
across
the
company
to
design
clinical
study
and
manufacture
both
therapeutic
and
vaccine
he
state
that
pfizer
have
start
mobilize
our
vaccine
expert
at
site
around
the
world
to
prepare
for
this
second
approach
against
covid
and
that
we
would
share
with
everyone
around
that
table
what
we
be
learn
act
as
one
team
and
move
swiftly
give
the
urgency
of
the
situation
that
s
fantastic
the
president
reply
thank
you
very
much
that
s
really
very
excite
mikael
call
me
later
that
day
to
report
on
the
meeting
he
told
me
that
most
of
the
discussion
be
about
treatment
not
prevention
tony
fauci
seem
to
be
get
excite
when
i
say
we
will
go
for
a
vaccine
as
well
mikael
say
in
the
meantime
the
world
start
to
change
as
the
virus
spread
the
forum
i
have
be
invite
to
speak
at
the
delphi
economic
forum
be
suddenly
and
urgently
postpone
for
me
this
trigger
a
major
alarm
and
i
decide
to
return
home
early
on
the
plane
i
kept
think
about
the
emerge
situation
with
this
coronavirus
and
what
the
pfizer
priority
should
be
in
response
to
it
coronaviruses
be
a
large
family
of
virus
name
for
the
crown
like
protein
spike
on
their
outer
surface
this
be
not
the
first
time
we
d
have
to
worry
about
them
in
the
outbreak
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
sars
cause
worldwide
concern
with
its
swift
global
spread
result
in
thousand
of
infection
and
approximately
percent
mortality
laboratory
in
hong
kong
and
germany
and
the
us
cdc
confirm
the
root
cause
to
be
a
novel
coronavirus
the
disease
be
control
within
month
a
few
year
later
in
another
novel
coronavirus
which
may
have
transfer
to
human
from
infect
dromedary
camel
become
the
cause
of
another
respiratory
syndrome
the
middle
east
respiratory
syndrome
mers
cov
however
now
the
situation
with
covid
be
look
different
for
example
in
china
we
have
to
shut
down
our
facility
to
protect
the
safety
of
our
people
from
covid
this
be
not
something
we
d
have
to
do
with
sars
or
mers
would
we
have
to
do
the
same
with
our
facility
around
the
world
i
also
knew
from
china
that
in
the
first
week
of
covid
the
hospital
in
the
affected
area
be
overwhelmed
could
that
happen
in
other
part
of
the
world
and
if
yes
would
these
hospital
have
enough
medical
supply
to
treat
the
patient
who
would
storm
their
intensive
care
unit
icu
for
us
at
pfizer
this
question
be
translate
into
would
we
be
able
to
supply
them
with
enough
quantity
of
the
medicine
they
need
i
start
imagine
dark
scenario
where
the
global
demand
for
hospital
medicine
be
grow
exponentially
and
at
the
same
time
our
manufacturing
site
be
shut
down
because
of
the
disease
and
be
unable
to
supply
enough
treatment
finally
i
kept
ask
two
question
what
if
the
medicine
that
physician
have
currently
in
their
hand
be
not
effective
enough
against
this
virus
as
seem
to
be
the
case
in
china
and
could
pfizer
do
something
about
it
i
knew
that
in
we
have
test
some
molecule
against
mers
that
seem
to
have
good
antiviral
activity
maybe
we
could
test
them
against
this
virus
as
well
it
be
a
long
flight
to
come
back
home
and
i
ruminate
for
hour
and
write
thought
in
a
pfizer
board
of
director
notebook
that
i
have
pull
from
my
bag
before
land
i
clear
my
note
by
consolidate
a
few
bullet
and
delete
those
that
didn
t
seem
important
enough
for
the
moment
i
take
a
new
piece
of
paper
and
i
write
on
it
what
i
thought
would
be
the
top
three
priority
for
pfizer

our
executive
team
meeting
room

my
reminder
to
always
put
patient
first

day
in
that
room
many
important
decision
related
to
the
three
priority
i
write
on
the
plane
have
to
be
make
but
originally
covid
be
not
suppose
to
be
the
topic
of
discussion
that
day
we
be
suppose
to
continue
our
discussion
for
our
ongoing
major
reorganization
effort
not
surprisingly
the
decision
we
d
make
in
to
increase
our
investment
in
r
d
and
digital
capability
couple
with
the
need
to
reduce
our
cost
base
in
marketing
and
administration
have
create
a
lot
of
anxiety
and
tension
covid
be
not
yet
the
central
focus
it
would
become
leader
be
still
figure
out
where
they
stood
in
the
re
org
a
ceo
must
have
a
spider
sense
for
tension
within
the
leadership
team
i
be
sense
in
early
march
that
our
effort
to
reimagine
pfizer
s
organizational
structure
be
cause
emotion
to
boil
over
to
let
off
some
steam
i
plan
a
dinner
with
my
executive
team
for
that
night
at
the
aptly
name
break
bar
on
ninth
avenue
in
new
york
the
break
bar
be
everything
you
d
expect
from
any
other
bar
with
a
big
twist
or
smash
here
when
you
be
do
with
your
shot
pint
or
wine
you
smash
the
glass
be
how
it
advertises
itself
you
can
book
a
rage
room
at
vary
level
of
intensity
anger
problem
or
rampage
for
example
i
felt
it
be
a
creative
way
to
let
my
team
know
that
i
understood
how
they
felt
the
dinner
never
happen
though
the
covid
lockdown
cancel
all
plan
at
our
weekly
executive
leadership
team
roundtable
in
mid
march
the
day
we
be
suppose
to
go
to
the
break
bar
covid
be
the
main
concern
in
the
air
i
make
it
clear
that
it
be
time
to
rise
to
the
occasion
i
discuss
with
them
the
priority
i
have
set
on
my
flight
back
the
safety
and
well
be
of
employee
maintain
supply
of
critical
medicine
and
develop
new
medical
solution
against
covid
we
start
make
decision
one
of
the
first
and
most
difficult
at
the
time
be
to
close
all
our
office
facility
around
the
world
and
work
remotely
we
debate
this
question
before
the
city
and
state
of
new
york
issue
lockdown
order
when
i
ask
to
go
around
the
room
to
hear
from
each
person
it
be
clear
there
be
differ
view
after
hearing
them
all
i
have
to
make
a
decision
i
decide
to
do
it
we
have
to
close
all
office
and
start
work
remotely
i
turn
to
lidia
fonseca
our
chief
digital
officer
and
told
her
you
must
make
this
work
there
be
a
lot
at
stake
here
for
me
this
decision
didn
t
come
easy
i
be
an
extrovert
i
gain
energy
by
interact
with
people
it
s
important
to
look
someone
in
the
eye
read
body
language
walk
down
the
hall
with
someone
after
a
difficult
conversation
how
could
i
work
from
home
i
be
surprised
to
find
once
we
start
work
remotely
how
easy
the
change
come
for
me
walk
through
the
kitchen
turn
left
and
you
find
the
laundry
turn
right
and
you
find
my
home
office
it
be
a
relatively
small
room
suitable
for
no
more
than
four
people
but
the
size
would
no
longer
matter
in
the
next
eighteen
month
i
could
fit
dozen
of
people
on
my
new
computer
screen
i
could
still
look
them
in
the
eye
and
read
their
body
language
at
least
from
the
part
you
could
see
on
the
screen
once
this
decision
be
make
someone
ask
what
will
happen
to
the
people
that
be
work
in
our
building
but
be
not
our
own
employee
as
be
typical
with
many
large
organization
many
people
work
in
the
mailroom
security
cafeteria
service
and
sanitation
be
employee
of
other
company
that
have
contract
with
us
to
provide
their
service
we
work
with
these
people
daily
and
everyone
think
about
them
like
member
of
the
family
in
fact
one
of
my
first
thought
be
what
would
happen
to
luis
luis
perdomo
be
a
barista
in
our
cafe
and
he
be
a
bit
of
a
legend
at
pfizer
he
be
also
the
epitome
of
joy
his
smile
light
up
the
room
and
for
many
of
us
who
drink
coffee
he
be
the
first
person
we
see
when
we
come
to
the
office
though
his
life
have
not
always
be
easy
he
tragically
lose
his
teenage
son
to
cancer
a
few
year
ago
you
can
always
count
on
luis
for
a
smile
a
kind
word
and
if
you
re
really
lucky
a
morning
hug
he
be
a
true
gem
so
much
so
that
we
forgive
him
for
his
undying
love
of
the
boston
red
sox
the
concern
we
be
all
feel
be
that
if
we
close
the
office
and
discontinue
some
of
these
service
for
a
prolong
period
luis
and
many
other
wonderful
service
provider
would
likely
lose
their
job
let
s
maintain
regular
payment
to
all
these
contractor
under
the
condition
that
they
keep
the
people
work
for
us
regularly
employ
even
though
they
won
t
provide
their
service
to
us
i
say
everyone
felt
good
about
it
our
procurement
team
take
the
responsibility
to
make
this
happen
work
with
each
of
the
business
within
the
company
to
keep
contractor
paid
wherever
possible
these
early
decision
take
care
of
the
first
priority
i
have
write
on
my
flight
back
home
safety
and
well
be
of
employee
i
be
happy
because
like
other
ceo
i
felt
tremendous
responsibility
for
the
health
and
welfare
of
the
ninety
thousand
pfizer
employee
around
the
world
but
i
also
felt
we
have
additional
responsibility
as
a
healthcare
company
in
the
middle
of
a
health
crisis
our
people
discover
develop
and
produce
medicine
for
hundred
of
million
of
patient
globally
people
who
rely
on
us
each
and
every
day
people
suffer
with
cancer
heart
disease
or
arthritis
our
research
center
and
manufacturing
plant
around
the
world
would
have
to
remain
open
my
immediate
fear
be
express
in
the
second
priority
i
have
set
for
us
supply
of
critical
medicine
covid
or
not
people
have
to
receive
their
medicine
i
be
concerned
with
potential
shortage
of
need
medicine
stockouts
as
we
call
the
situation
i
be
particularly
concerned
with
hospital
they
be
expect
to
get
overcrowd
and
pfizer
be
one
of
the
large
supplier
of
injectable
hospital
medicine
in
the
world
i
discuss
this
concern
with
frank
d
amelio
our
long
stand
and
highly
regard
chief
financial
officer
who
like
to
roll
up
his
sleeve
and
problem
solve
frank
who
also
have
the
responsibility
of
oversee
manufacturing
warn
me
that
stockouts
would
be
inevitable
the
demand
for
these
medicine
could
be
ten
to
fifty
time
high
and
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
difficult
to
ramp
up
production
under
covid
restriction
i
rally
our
team
implore
that
we
must
deliver
in
the
middle
of
a
health
crisis
failure
be
not
an
option
they
acknowledge
the
challenge
and
immediately
jumped
to
a
wartime
footing
we
already
have
in
place
a
crisis
management
plan
that
be
developed
year
ago
with
situation
like
this
in
mind
the
management
of
manufacturing
have
already
activate
this
plan
and
our
manufacturing
site
be
operating
under
preparedness
level
which
involve
certain
restriction
and
special
safety
measure
we
decide
to
elevate
all
site
to
preparedness
level
only
people
essential
for
the
operation
would
be
allow
in
and
much
stricter
safety
guideline
would
be
implement
in
the
next
few
week
i
be
amaze
to
see
the
dedication
of
our
manufacturing
worker
the
number
of
absentee
remain
at
less
than
percent
at
the
same
time
i
felt
an
obligation
to
all
those
worker
who
have
to
report
every
day
to
the
manufacturing
site
while
the
rest
of
us
be
work
from
the
safety
of
our
home
i
felt
i
need
to
make
a
gesture
of
support
and
i
ask
to
visit
one
of
our
manufacturing
site
to
express
to
the
worker
my
solidarity
my
request
be
deny
by
their
management
my
chief
of
staff
at
the
time
deb
mangone
my
trust
thought
partner
of
many
year
call
to
give
me
the
news
albert
they
say
you
should
not
go
why
i
reply
because
you
be
not
consider
essential
she
say
and
laugh
this
be
the
moment
i
realize
how
professional
these
people
be
and
felt
confident
that
we
be
on
the
right
track
return
to
the
purpose
circle
the
time
we
have
allot
to
this
meeting
be
approach
its
end
but
we
still
have
to
discus
our
most
impactful
priority
new
medical
solution
against
covid
immediately
after
the
sequence
of
the
virus
be
release
we
start
look
in
our
molecular
library
for
antiviral
compound
that
match
we
identify
several
that
be
promising
but
more
test
be
need
additionally
only
a
couple
of
day
earlier
mikael
and
i
have
agree
to
commit
to
the
president
of
the
united
state
that
we
would
work
on
a
covid
vaccine
we
discuss
both
the
potential
to
develop
antiviral
treatment
and
a
new
vaccine
that
could
work
against
covid
but
these
program
cost
a
lot
of
money
money
that
be
not
budget
frank
d
amelio
remind
us
of
this
and
ask
how
much
money
we
be
talk
about
i
still
remember
frank
s
facial
expression
when
mikael
give
him
his
ballpark
projection
ouch
mikael
frank
say
as

angela
hwang

concern
that

significantly
and
negatively
affect
our
forecast
revenue
stream
of
our
current
business
angela
lead
all
our
commercial
activity
and
be
one
of
the
savviest
business
leader
i
know

i
take
very
seriously
her

bad
of
both
world
for
a
publicly
list
company
not
only
be
we
about
to
spend
way
more
than
we
have
budget
but
we
be
also
go
to
have
low
revenue
than
we
have
project
as
we
be
all
struggle
with
the
reality
of
the
number
i
ask
everyone
s
opinion
on
this
issue
they
all
felt
the
same
we
must
do
it
in
situation
like
this
with
so
many
life
at
stake
financials
should
fall
low
on
the
priority
list
i
be
proud
of
our
team
all
of
them
and
i
point
toward
the
wall
with
the
picture
of
our
beloved
patient
and
say
clearly
this
be
not
business
as
usual
if
we
miss
our
budget
for
a
year
no
one
will
remember
it
the
year
after
if
we
miss
the
opportunity
to
do
something
for
the
world
now
we
will
all
remember
it
forever
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
i
go
through
the
room
to
each
of
my
executive
leadership
team
member
and
assign
them
specific
task
related
to
what
we
have
agree
i
sense
the
team
s
resolve
and
they
sense
in
me
that
we
be
go
into
battle
together
it
be
the
last
time
in
that
we
met
in
the
purpose
circle
but
the
groundwork
it
laid
prepared
us
for
the
battle
ahead
this
day
be
the
begin
of
our
moonshot

what
be
obvious
be
not
always
right
you
will
never
do
anything
in
this
world
without
courage
it
be
the
great
quality
of
the
mind
next
to
honor
aristotle
bc
during
those
harrow
nine
month
in
we
have
to
make
hundred
of
difficult
decision
many
of
them
come
down
to
me
the
pressure
be
as
high
as
you
can
imagine
it
s
not
an
easy
thing
when
you
feel
the
hope
of
billion
of
people
and
million
of
business
and
hundred
of
government
invest
in
this
industry
and
you
be
the
lead
company
in
this
industry
and
it
happens
that
you
be
the
ceo
and
also
a
new
ceo
you
feel
that
pressure
on
your
shoulder
and
you
feel
that
you
need
to
rise
to
the
occasion
what
be
at
stake
be
beyond
imagination
it
be
the
health
of
the
whole
planet
in
a
pandemic
that
we
haven
t
experienced
in
a
hundred
year
it
be
the
fate
of
the
global
economy
as
country
around
the
world
become
paralyze
by
lockdown
and
practical
fear
and
then
to
make
it
even
bad
it
be
also
a
political
debate
in
the
middle
of
an
american
presidential
election
in
a
time
of
deep
polarization
it
shouldn
t
come
down
to
politics
and
yet
that
be
a
pressure
too
i
need
to
navigate
all
that
and
still
try
to
lead
my
team
to
deliver
to
the
world
a
solution
that
would
save
life
our
effort
be
not
without
shortcoming
but
we
be
fortunate
to
get
more
decision
right
than
wrong
most
important
we
be
fortunate
to
get
the
most
critical
one
right
and
as
usual
in
life
the
most
critical
decision
be
the
most
challenge
to
make
when
i
look
back
the
one
that
clearly
stood
out
be
the
decision
to
use
the
mrna
technology
to
develop
a
covid
vaccine
not
only
because
a
different
choice
would
have
yield
very
different
outcome
it
be
also
because
that
particular
decision
be
the
most
counterintuitive
the
obvious
option
be
not
to
use
mrna
it
require
a
lot
of
forward
think
and
eventually
a
lot
of
courage
but
this
be
what
give
us
the
vaccine
when
i
ask
our
team
to
develop
an
effective
vaccine
in
record
time
the
option
they
could
choose
from
be
abundant
for
moderna
for
example
the
critical
question
would
be
should
we
try
to
develop
a
covid
vaccine
or
not
which
technology
to
use
would
never
be
a
question
for
them
they
be
highly
specialized
in
mrna
and
when
they
decide
to
pursue
a
vaccine
this
would
be
for
them
the
obvious
and
the
only
option
but
for
us
it
be
different
our
research
team
have
experience
with
many
available
technological
platform
upon
which
to
build
the
vaccine
include
adenovirus
recombinant
protein
conjugation
mrna
and
others
my
first
challenge
to
them
be
to
recommend
which
platform
we
should
bet
on
they
debate
among
themselves
and
to
my
surprise
they
come
back
to
me
with
the
suggestion
to
use
the
mrna
platform
two
year
earlier
we
have
partner
with
a
german
biotech
company
call
biontech
found
in
by
a
kind
charismatic
and
humble
husband
and
wife
team
to
focus
on
cancer
treatment
their
mrna
technology
we
felt
have
the
potential
to
help
us
with
our
effort
to
create
a
much
more
effective
seasonal
flu
vaccine
i
be
a
big
fan
of
the
mrna
technology
and
certainly
believe
we
have
a
good
chance
to
transform
the
development
of
flu
vaccine
but
i
be
think
that
we
be
still
a
few
year
away
from
this
advancement
mikael
broke
the
news
to
me
we
d
be
pursue
an
mrna
solution
and
my
first
reaction
be
surprise
select
this
technology
to
develop
a
covid
vaccine
be
not
the
obvious
choice
while
mrna
vaccine
be
not
a
magic
bullet
for
every
epidemic
or
pandemic
of
the
future
in
this
pandemic
they
literally
help
save
the
world
so
before
i
describe
my
discussion
with
mikael
the
mrna
vaccine
story
merit
be
fully
told
in
nature
mrna
be
a
single
strand
chemical
molecule
that
be
complementary
to
one
of
the
two
dna
strand
of
a

the
dna
hold
all
the
information
require
for
the
body
to
form
and
function
for
example
the
instruction
on
how
to
produce
a
protein
let
s
say
a
hormone
that
be
critical
for
our
function
be
always
cod
in
our
dna
and
be
transmit
genetically
from
generation
to
generation
when
our
body
need
to
produce
this
hormone
it
will
copy
these
instruction
on
an
mrna
molecule
and
send
it
to
an
organelle
call
a
ribosome
which
will
move
along
the
mrna
read
its
instruction
and
produce
the
hormone

there
be
many
different
type
of
vaccine
use
to
help
prevent
infection
all
of
which
have
the
same
goal
to
train
your
immune
system
to
recognize
and
defend
against
infectious
disease
agent
which
be
call
pathogen
vaccine
usually
contain
weaken
dead
or
noninfectious
part
of
these
pathogen
they
cannot
cause
the
disease
but
your
immune
system
will
recognize
them
as
a
foreign
invader
and
will
summon
its
defense
against
them
i
e
antibody
and
t
cell
when
the
real
pathogen
come
along
the
body
will
be
ready
with
million
of
antibody
and
t
cell
that
will
attack
them
immediately
and
with
force
reduce
their
chance
of
cause
disease
the
novel
mrna
vaccine
however
be
different
they
be
not
make
up
of
an
actual
pathogen
they
don
t
contain
weaken
dead
or
noninfectious
part
of
a
virus
or
bacterium
they
contain
instruction
on
how
our
body
could
produce
protein
that
be
part
of
these
pathogen
construct
when
our
ribosome
receive
the
instruction
by
reading
the
mrna
that
we
inject
they
start
produce
these
part
of
the
pathogen
which
our
immune
system
will
recognize
immediately
as
invader
our
system
will
then
mobilize
an
immune
response
that
will
protect
us
from
the
real
pathogen
if
they
come
along
in
a
nutshell
mrna
teach
the
body
to
make
its
own
vaccine
the
injection
be
a
set
of
instruction
for

these

early
signal
of
what
be
to
come
pfizer
have
be
interested
in
rna
in
part
because
of
its
ability
to
respond
quickly
to
change
and
be
consistent
although
molecule
of
rna
also
can
vary
in
their
behavior
one
piece
of
rna
behaves
a
lot
more
like
another
piece
of
rna
in
general
than
either
virus
or
protein
do
we
like
the
flexibility
of
the
technology
compare
with
traditional
vaccine
technology
this
flexibility
include
the
ability
to
alter
the
rna
sequence
in
the
vaccine
to
potentially
address
new
strain
of
the
virus
if
one
be
to
emerge
that
be
not
well
cover
by
the
current

in

have
turn
to
kathrin
and
her
research
team
to
identify
a
partnership
that
would
advance
mrna

for

present
biontech
s
approach
to
mrna
he
later
told
me
that
at
the
begin
kathrin
have
a
lot
of
point
question
for
them
but
eventually
he
could
see
that
she
be
convince
we
recognize
almost
immediately
that
unlike
other
firm
we
d
spoken
with
biontech
be
agnostic
about
the
type
of
rna
that
might
work
in
other
word
they
refuse
to
favor
one
approach
over
the
other
they
come
from
the
mercurial
and
mysterious
world
of
oncology
so
they
be
curious
and
open
to
different
approach
they
be
scientifically
sophisticated
but
they
also
recognize
the
role
of
intuition
the
team
at
pfizer
and
biontech
clicked
immediately
because
of
similar
worldviews
and
a
three
year
research
collaboration
agreement
be
sign
during
this
period
biontech
would
transfer
to
us
technical
expertise
and
license
that
would
allow
us
to
develop
a
novel
influenza
vaccine
i
be
the
coo
of
the
company
at
that
time
and
when
the
agreement
reach
my
desk
for
approval
i
execute
it
immediately
the
size
of
this
contract
be
relatively
small
by
pfizer
s
standard
so
i
didn
t
ask
to
see
the
ceo
of
the
company
as
i
would
typically
do
with
large
deal
little
do
i
know
then
that
our
mrna
influenza
vaccine
work
would
give
us
a
profound
head
start
when
covid
struck
two
year
later
in
january
as
covid
spread
in
china
our
partner
at
biontech
be
among
the
first
to
jump
on
the
virus
study
its
sequence
and
effect
from
data
on
the
internet
chinese
researcher
publish
the
virus
s
genetic
sequence
on
january
the
virus
be
spread
in
a
way
no
one
could
understand
much
less
contain
a
major
vaccine
effort
be
need
but
biontech
would
need
a
partner
ugur
thought
of
us
and
give
the
positive
interaction
and
trust
establish
during
flu
collaboration
he
call
kathrin
but
before
kathrin
receive
the
call
i
have
already
ask
her
and
her
team
to
suggest
the
technology
platform
we
should
use
for
our
own
vaccine
effort
she
have
decide
to
suggest
mrna
and
mikael
dolsten
facetimed
me
to
let
me
know
the
suggestion
i
be
surprised
mikael
to
be
honest
i
didn
t
expect
that
i
told
him
it
would
be
a
very
risky
and
complicate
bet
my
doubt
be
ground
on
fact
and
rational
think
first
the
technology
be
promising
but
not
proven
if
we
be
successful
this
would
be
not
only
the
first
covid
vaccine
but
also
the
first
ever
mrna
vaccine
that
the
world
would
see
in
contrast
the
adenovirus
and
protein
technology
platform
with
which
we
have
even
well
familiarity
have
deliver
multiple
other
successful
vaccine
in
the
past
second
we
would
have
to
negotiate
an
agreement
with
biontech
a
process
that
typically
take
month
to
complete
we
want
to
move
fast
and
negotiate
contract
didn
t
feel
easy
to
do
under
time
pressure
third
biontech
be
small
and
we
likely
would
have
to
absorb
all
the
development
and
manufacturing
cost
and
realize
in
case
of
failure
significant
loss
alone
but
we
would
have
to
split
the
profit
with
them
in
case
of
success
i
point
out
all
these
concern
and
discuss
them
with
mikael
be
you
sure
about
this
i
ask
he
be
mikael
be
convince
through
our
work
with
flu
that
the
technology
be
the
right
choice
the
technology
be
ideal
for
something
like
this
it
be
fast
and
capable
of
be
edit
quickly
for
update
and
booster
adenovirus
or
other
viral
vector
technology
could
have
difficulty
with
booster
because
the
immune
system
will
create
antibody
not
only
against
the
coronavirus
but
also
against
the
adenovirus
he
say
mikael
knew
from
previous
discussion
that
the
speed
of
development
and
the
ability
to
boost
frequently
be
very
high
priority
for
me
with
a
forethought
that
be
sadly
correct
i
be
afraid
that
by
the
winter
of
we
would
have
a
new
and
probably
more
lethal
wave
of
covid
as
happen
with
the
influenza
pandemic
a
century
ago
we
need
to
have
a
vaccine
by
then
i
also
knew
that
a
virus
with
these
characteristic
would
mutate
sooner
rather
than
later
it
be
important
to
have
a
vaccine
that
we
could
boost
as
often
as
be
need
without
the
fear
of
lose
potency
i
start
see
his
rationale
but
continued
the
discussion
what
about
use
protein
technology
i
ask
we
be
good
with
protein
and
we
could
certainly
make
a
vaccine
with
this
platform
but
with
mrna
we
would
have
both
humoral
and
cellular
immune
response
with
protein
we
will
have
good
antibody
but
i
be
not
sure
we
would
have
t
cell
he
reply
we
discuss
a
little
bit
about
potential
manufacturing
hurdle
how
a
development
program
with
mrna
could
look
and
at
the
end
i
express
my
concern
about
have
to
partner
with
another
party
in
a
hurry
mikael
felt
that
kathrin
jansen
have
developed
good
relation
with
the
founder
of
biontech
and
signing
a
contract
would
not
be
a
challenge
okay
mikael
i
say
let
s
gather
the
team
to
discus
their
proposal
mikael
be
relieve
and
pleased
that
i
didn
t
reject
the
idea
up
front
and
that
i
be
willing
to
explore
it
far
a
few
day
later
mikael
assemble
kathrin
and
her
team
of
scientist
in
addition
to
phil
kathrin
have
invite
bill
gruber

by
training
bill
have
decade
long
experience
with
respiratory
disease
he
obtain
his
undergraduate
education
at
rice
university
and
attend
baylor
college
of
medicine
for
medical
school
residency
and
a
postdoctoral
fellowship
in
pediatric
infectious
disease
he
then
join
the
faculty
at
vanderbilt
university
where
he
focus
his
research
work
on
viral
respiratory
infection
notably
respiratory
syncytial
virus
rsv
and
influenza
rsv
be
a
common
respiratory
virus
that
usually
cause
cold
like
symptom
prior
to
covid
we
be
on
the
fast
track
to
develop
an
rsv
vaccine
and
we
have
accumulate
already
significant
knowledge
about
what
work
and
what
do
not
the
relevant
part
for
the
discussion
be
that
rsv
in
addition
to
be
a
respiratory
disease
also
have
a
similar
spike
like
covid
other
very
talented
scientist
be
also
on
the
videoconference
how
would
you
like
to
do
this
albert
kathrin
ask
let
s
start
by
focus
the
discussion
on
the
opportunity
what
be
the
benefit
we
get
by
use
this
technology
i
say
then
we
can
discus
the
challenge
and
what
we
can
do
to
overcome
them
during
that
meeting
we
discuss
in
great
detail
the
thing
that
we
have
conceptually
discuss
with
mikael
two
day
ago
they
explain
that
this
technology
would
enable
our
researcher
to
design
and
modify
the
mrna
very
rapidly
because
mrna
be
synthetic
it
doesn
t
contain
live
viral
particle
which
make
it
a
much
more
well
define
product
it
would
allow
our
team
to
administer
the
vaccine
several
time
if
need
not
just
during
the
pandemic
but
also
later
if
an
immunity
boost
be
need
because
of
virus
mutation
where
a
traditional
type
of
vaccine
might
take
month
to
design
this
mrna
version
would
need
just
a
couple
of
week
they
told
me
that
they
have
very
good
expertise
with
this
technology
and
that
they
felt
the
technology
be
mature
enough
to
give
a
vaccine
when
we
discuss
the
challenge
phil
spoke
up
you
know
with
mrna
we
can
move
quickly
but
the
vaccine
will
have
to
be
frozen
to
remain
stable
during
distribution
i
hadn
t
thought
about
it
before
and
i
realize
that
this
could
be
a
major
disadvantage
what
can
we
do
about
it
i
ask
we
can
develop
later
a
more
stable
formulation
but
at
the
begin
we
will
have
to
deal
with
it
manufacturing
should
find
a
way
to
manage
it
then
i
ask
if
we
thought
biontech
would
agree
to
work
with
us
on
this
kathrin
say
that
ugur
have
already
call
her
to
express
an
interest
i
felt
that
a
decision
have
to
be
make
clearly
select
the
mrna
platform
be
a
much
riskier
and
more
complicate
option
than
all
the
others
we
have
available
but
it
be
the
fast
way
to
a
solution
and
my
entire
team
be
percent
behind
this
choice
vaccinologists
represent
a
special
character
in
life
science
all
physician
and
life
scientist
be
call
to
the
field
of
medicine
to
help
people
but
i
ve
found
that
people
who
get
involve
with
vaccine
be
different
first
they
tend
to
come
to
the
industry
to
work
only
on
vaccine
and
they
be
extremely
commit
to
protect
people
second
they
be
generally
more
conservative
unlike
medicine
which
be
design
to
treat
disease
and
chronic
condition
vaccine
be
about
prevention
therefore
this
approach
engenders
a
completely
different
mindset
vaccinologists
must
weigh
risk
and
benefit
differently
than
most
physician
if
i
be
treat
a
patient
with
cancer
for
example
i
calculate
risk
differently
than
if
i
be
protect
a
healthy
individual
vaccinologists
face
a
lot
of
scrutiny
in
term
of
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
their
research
program
and
as
a
result
be
very
conservative
with
their
choice
know
that
i
realize
how
deeply
convince
they
must
be
to
suggest
such
a
risky
option
and
they
be
the
best
expert
in
the
world
my
gut
told
me
that
this
be
the
right
choice
and
i
told
them
okay
mrna
it
be
i
will
call
their
ceo
tomorrow
i
have
never
met
ugur
in
person
before
we
have
never
spoken
even
on
the
phone
during
the
previous
two
year
that
we
be
collaborate
on
a
flu
vaccine
there
be
never
a
need
for
us
to
speak
he
be
always
talk
to
kathrin
or
mikael
i
take
the
initiative
to
call
him
introduce
myself
and
express
my
deep
dedication
to
the
success
of
this
program
we
start
talk
and
from
the
first
moment
we
hit
it
off
the
personal
chemistry
be
there
and
be
instant
although
our
personality
be
profoundly
different
i
be
an
extroverted
greek
jew
who
immigrate
to
the
us
ugur
be
an
introvert
turkish
muslim
who
immigrate
to
germany
i
felt
immediately
that
i
could
trust
him
we
discuss
the
principle
of
our
collaboration
we
would
let
science
drive
our
decision
above
everything
else
the
goal
would
be
to
deliver
the
safest
and
most
effective
vaccine
we
could
each
one
of
our
company
would
focus
its
effort
on
the
area
of
its
specific
expertise
but
we
would
be
fifty
fifty
partner
on
everything
at
the
end
i
told
him
that
time
be
of
the
essence
and
i
ask
him
if
he
would
feel
comfortable
start
the
work
before
we
sign
a
contract
ugur
it
could
take
month
to
finalize
all
the
need
agreement
the
research
manufacturing
and
commercial
contract
albert
your
word
be
enough
for
me
ugur
say
we
can
start
the
research
work
immediately
the
lawyer
should
focus
on
the
research
agreement
first
and
when
it
s
ready
we
can
sign
it
the
other
contract
can
wait
i
immediately
agree
with
that
i
felt
that
with
biontech
we
could
and
would
have
to
think
differently
in
a
crisis
that
demand
a
novel
approach
the
next
day
our
team
and
the
team
at
biontech
in
germany
held
a
wide
range
conference
call
to
discus
candidate
antigen
toxicology
study
plan
first
in
human
clinical
trial
plan
regulatory
interaction
and
manufacturing
schedule
they
discuss
disaster
planning
if
one
or
more
site
be
to
go
down
for
whatever
reason
they
agree
on
the
basic
plan
and
start
have
daily
meeting
a
couple
of
week
later
with
plan
already
well
advanced
we
sign
a
letter
of
intent
so
that
the
lawyer
from
both
side
could
be
reassure
that
at
least
we
have
something
in
write
on
april
we
sign
a
collaboration
agreement
to
codevelop
a
first
in
class
mrna
base
coronavirus
vaccine
aim
at
prevent
covid
infection
biontech
receive
from
us
a
million
up
front
payment
and
be
eligible
for
future
milestone
payment
of
an
additional
million
for
a
total
consideration
of
about
million
in
addition
we
be
go
to
provide
million
in
cash
to
them
by
buying
equity
from
the
company
bring
our
total
ownership
of
the
company
to
about
percent
at
that
time
under
the
collaboration
agreement
the
two
party
agree
to
share
all
development
cost
and
profit
fifty
fifty
but
pfizer
agree
to
cover
all
these
cost
up
front
if
the
project
fail
pfizer
would
bear
all
the
loss
alone
if
the
project
succeed
biontech
would
pay
back
to
pfizer
its
share
of
development
cost
from
its
profit
from
the
commercialization
of
the
product
although
we
didn
t
agree
to
all
the
term
two
company
normally
would
address
when
start
a
project
of
this
size
and
complexity
we
do
agree
that
biontech
would
have
commercialization
right
of
the
potential
vaccine
in
germany
and
turkey
and
pfizer
would
hold
these
right
in
the
rest
of
the
world
china
be
exclude
from
this
agreement
as
biontech
already
have
an
agreement
with
a
chinese
company
for
china
hong
kong
macau
and
taiwan
the
collaboration
agreement
also
call
out
specific
agreement
that
the
two
party
would
need
to
negotiate
and
conclude
relate
to
the
collaboration
agreement
these
be
the
manufacturing
and
commercial
agreement
in
the
month
that
follow
we
dedicate
our
entire
focus
to
our
effort
to
develop
get
approval
for
and
manufacture
this
vaccine
we
never
found
the
time
to
conclude
the
manufacturing
and
commercial
agreement
in
we
continued
cooperate
under
the
initial
letter
of
intent
the
collaboration
agreement
and
just
as
important
our
mutual
trust
until
january
when
we
sign
the
commercial
agreement

think
big
make
the
impossible
possible
our
problem
be
not
that
we
aim
too
high
and
miss
but
we
aim
too
low
and
hit
aristotle
bc
under
normal
circumstance
the
development
of
a
vaccine
take
year
many
of
these
project
fail
in
the
case
of
hiv
scientist
have
be
work
on
a
vaccine
for
decade
and
we
still
don
t
have
one
available
from
discovery
to
development
to
approval
to
manufacturing
to
distribution
new
vaccine
must
adhere
to
a
highly
regulate
process
before
reach
people
s
arm
the
process
require
patience
and
perseverance
scientist
in
the
lab
work
for
year
on
an
idea
root
in
basic
science
before
they
be
allow
to
develop
several
prototype
for
far
test
in
a
highly
reiterative
process
that
usually
also
take
year
these
prototype
be
test
in
tube
and
animal
and
then
sent
back
to
the
lab
for
adjustment
that
will
well
the
idea
and
theoretically
improve
the
perceive
efficacy
or
safety
after
these
adjustment
they
be
retested
again
and
again
in
a
process
that
aim
to
discover
the
best
candidate
we
do
preclinical
and
toxicological
study
reactogenicity
study
virus
neutralization
study
immunogenicity
study
efficacy
study
and
many
other
type
of
highly
specialized
study
in
most
case
the
test
and
assay
that
be
necessary
to
ass
and
evaluate
the
different
prototype
do
not
exist
and
we
will
have
to
create
those
too
before
we
can
test
the
prototype
every
time
we
see
something
that
we
do
not
like
for
example
fever
in
mouse
or
weak
virus
neutralization
we
will
run
additional
experiment
to
understand
these
effect
and
suggest
change
to
the
prototype
of
course
the
molecular
engineer
who
be
work
on
these
prototype
confront
many
other
worry
as
well
for
example
the
prototype
will
have
to
be
chemically
or
biologically
scalable
this
mean
that
if
successful
they
can
be
manufacture
with
high
quality
at
large
scale
otherwise
the
development
of
a
promising
prototype
could
come
to
nothing
this
be
not
a
give
all
the
time
on
many
occasion
we
have
stop
develop
promising
molecule
because
it
be
impossible
to
reproduce
them
outside
the
lab
at
a
large
scale
if
these
preclinical
study
in
the
lab
be
successful
they
will
eventually
identify
a
few
candidate
that
give
us
good
reason
to
believe
they
will
be
safe
and
effective
then
we
begin
our
clinical
study
in
human
first
we
start
with
study
that
will
allow
us
to
identify
the
right
dose
these
be
phase
study
on
healthy
volunteer
subject
that
we
call
dose
escalation
study
we
always
start
with
a
very
small
dose
and
put
the
subject
under
close
medical
supervision
we
be
do
test
and
look
for
any
signal
that
could
create
any
safety
concern
if
everything
be
approve
to
go
forward
we
move
to
a
high
dose
and
repeat
the
same
process
at
the
same
time
we
measure
the
biological
effect
that
each
dose
have
on
human
we
cannot
estimate
efficacy
at
this
stage
instead
we
be
look
for
surrogate
endpoint
possible
measure
of
effect
like
stimulation
of
the
immune
system
with
antibody
and
t
cell
response
we
progressively
increase
the
dose
until
we
reach
a
level
that
be
safe
and
satisfies
our
surrogate
criterion
for
efficacy
if
this
be
not
possible
we
go
back
to
the
molecular
scientist
to
reengineer
the
candidate
and
once
again
we
will
start
new
phase
study
with
new
vaccine
candidate
we
usually
do
this
several
time
until
we
be
either
successful
or
decide
to
discontinue
the
program
if
our
phase
study
be
successful
we
move
the
best
candidate
into
phase
study
in
the
phase
study
we
try
the
vaccine
candidate
in
different
regimen
one
or
two
dos
three
or
six
week
apart
in
young
or
old
adult
etc
we
be
try
many
combination
and
we
constantly
measure
safety
and
efficacy
surrogate
endpoint
until
we
decide
that
we
have
one
that
be
optimal
a
phase
study
usually
have
very
high
standard
for
determine
success
because
it
green
light
the
initiation
of
the
final
and
most
important
study
phase
the
learning
from
these

the
refine

necessary
to
initiate
a

study
this
phase
demand
the
most
significant
resource
and
manpower
with
the
intent
of
generate
the
data
necessary
to
receive
regulatory
approval
if
it
be
successful
you
have
a
vaccine
if
it
fails
the
program
be
usually
terminate
therefore
it
be
imperative
to
give
it
your
best

the
phase
study
be
crucial
and
require
for
regulatory

these
study
follow
very
strict
rule
and
standard
that

be
establish
by

like
the

fda

to
ensure
integrity
and
scientific
rigor
typically
they
run
for
a
long
period
of

typically
in
these

we
be
compare
a

the

of

if
a

the

the

that
only
a

this
way
we
can
be

will
not

usually
in
the

we
do
not

we
measure
real

there

step
the
regulatory
group
will
start
prepare
dossier
with
all
the
data
require
by
regulator
for
approval
typical
vaccine
dossier
for
initial
application
will
run
thousand
of
page
and
each
one
of
them
need
to
be
quality
control
for
accuracy
a
process
that
be
also
time
consume
at
the
same
time
the
manufacturing
group
start
the
preparation
for
the
industrial
production
of
the
new
vaccine
this
will
require
order
raw
material
and
in
some
case
specialized
equipment
that
usually
cost
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
i
be
keenly
aware
of
all
these
complexity
when
i
ask
our
research
team
to
bring
me
a
plan
for
an
effective
and
safe
vaccine
with
timeline
that
would
look
nothing
like
the
one
we
d
see
before
as
covid
infection
and
death
rise
in
early
the
world
face
an
unprecedented
crisis
and
we
have
to
rise
to
the
moment
we
have
a
fantastic
vaccine
team
staffed
with
some
of
the
most
brilliant
scientific
mind
in
the
world
they
immediately
start
the
work
a
few
week
later
in
an
april
video
call
meeting
kathrin
jansen
and
her
team
present
an
aggressive
plan
that
could
bring
the
result
of
a
pivotal
phase
study
to
completion
by
the
second
half
of
their
plan
depend
on
condense
year
of
require
work
into
eighteen
month
at
the
same
meeting
mike
mcdermott
the
head
of
our
manufacturing
group
present
plan
that
would
allow
us
to
develop
a
manufacturing
process
within
eighteen
month
include
find
appropriate
supplier
of
raw
material
and
design
from
scratch
new
specialized
equipment
that
would
probably
be
require
for
mrna
manufacturing
i
can
have
ten
of
million
of
dos
just
month
after
we
know
we
have
a
vaccine
mike
say
mike
direct
all
of
this
from
his
home
office
which
be
decorate
with
drawing
make
by
his
five
daughter
his
plan
would
smash
any
previous
record
of
drug
development
speed
and
manufacturing
scale
up
the
team
be
exhaust
and
proud
to
have
come
up
with
such
an
aggressive
plan
but
in
the
meantime
the
pandemic
have
take
a
dramatic
turn
for
the
bad
particularly
in
new
york
city
where
many
of
us
be
living
and
work
hospital
be
overflow
icu
do
not
have
enough
respirator
to
treat
patient
and
body
be
stack
in
refrigerate
truck
outside
because
all
the
morgue
be
full
every
night
when
i
go
to
sleep
and
every
morning
when
i
awoke
i
felt
the
anguish
the
toll
this
disease
be
take
infection
rate
and
death
grow
high
and
high
with
entire
economy
at
risk
the
quest
for
an
answer
go
beyond
the
future
of
any
one
organization
it
be
about
the
future
of
the
world
since
make
the
decision
with
mikael
to
go
for
develop
a
vaccine
i
have
come
to
feel
more
and
more
that
this
would
be
the
only
effective
solution
and
we
didn
t
have
time
i
knew
that
a
century
ago
during
the
influenza
pandemic
the
second
wave
be
much
more
lethal
than
the
first
i
also
knew
that
during
the
come
fall
we
would
face
the
double
danger
of
a
flu
season
amid
the
pandemic
it
be
not
good
enough
i
told
the
team
we
must
have
it
by
this
october
and
we
must
have
hundred
of
million
of
dos
by
next
year
not
ten
of
million
i
still
remember
their
surprised
face
project
on
my
computer
screen
it
be
not
a
look
of
disappointment
that
i
be
reject
their
plan
it
be
shock
and
confusion
over
what
exactly
i
be
ask
them
to
do
they
felt
it
be
impossible
we
debate
for
a
while
why
this
could
not
be
do
from
their
perspective
their
fact
be
solid
and
their
argument
clear
rationally
they
be
right
it
could
not
be
do
but
it
have
to
be
do
there
be
a
time
for
consensus
building
and
there
be
a
time
to
push
this
be
the
time
to
push
i
told
them
that
the
plan
be
not
accepted
period
i
ask
them
to
go
back
and
rethink
everything
from
the
begin
and
make
the
impossible
possible
they
should
have
zero
concern
on
cost
they
should
have
no
consideration
for
return
on
investment
they
could
have
all
the
resource
they
need
to
get
it
do
they
should
think
about
do
thing
in
parallel
instead
of
sequentially
they
should
design
their
experiment
in
clever
innovative
way
that
would
allow
us
to
learn
fast
and
eliminate
vaccine
prototype
rapidly
so
that
we
could
decide
on
the
final
one
quickly
they
should
build
manufacturing
capacity
at
risk
before
know
if
we
have
a
product
or
not
they
should
procure
all
need
raw
material
that
be
readily
available
and
place
committal
order
to
purchase
those
that
be
not
at
the
end
i
ask
them
also
to
include
a
final
slide
with
calculation
of
how
many
people
would
die
in
october
if
we
fail
to
produce
such
a
plan
a
week
later
the
team
come
back
to
me
with
a
genius
plan
that
if
successful
would
bring
us
result
by
the
end
of
october
the
design
of
the
phase
and
program
be
do
in
a
very
clever
way
instead
of
wait
to
have
all
candidate
release
from
the
lab
before
they
start
the
program
they
would
start
the
study
immediately
when
the
first
vaccine
candidate
become
available
they
would
test
it
on
multiple
combination
at
different
dos
in
different
regimen
and
with
different
age
group
so
they
could
develop
a
good
understand
of
how
the
candidate
interact
with
the
immune
system
once
the
second
candidate
become
available
they
would
follow
a
smart
plan
of
target
test
compare
it
with
the
first
one
these
test
would
allow
us
to
draw
conclusion
for
the
second
candidate
without
repeat
the
entire
set
of
test
we
have
do
for
the
first
we
would
repeat
the
same
with
the
third
and
fourth
candidate
the
idea
be
to
quickly
terminate
the
less
promising
candidate
concentrate
on
the
best
two
and
with
a
few
additional
test
select
the
final
candidate
that
would
move
to
a
phase
study
at
this
stage
of
their
presentation
they
warn
me
that
although
this
design
would
give
them
useful
information
to
inform
the
selection
of
the
best
candidate
the
risk
of
make
a
mistake
and
move
to
phase
with
a
suboptimal
candidate
be
great
in
hindsight
this
decision
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
critical
in
a
period
where
it
felt
like
we
be
make
life
and
death
choice
every
day
and
as
you
will
realize
in
a
moment
this
phase
study
will
cost
more
than
whatever
you
have
see
so
far
kathrin
jansen
told
me
i
take
a
mental
note
as
they
continued
their
presentation
the
phase
study
be
design
to
give
conclusive
result
in
the
fast
possible
way
it
be
go
to
be
a
placebo
control
double
blind
study
meaning
that
neither
the
participant
nor
the
researcher
would
know
which
treatment
they
receive
until
the
study
be
over
and
unblinded
it
would
be
randomize
one
to
one
meaning
an
equal
number
of
participant
would
receive
the
final
vaccine
candidate
and
the
placebo
the
fda
have
set
a
limit
of
at
least
percent
efficacy
for
a
vaccine
to
be
approve
our
team
have
design
the
study
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
vaccine
efficacy
of
percent
an
even
high
internal
standard
the
fda
usually
asks
for
two
month
of
safety
data
for
emergency
use
authorization
and
six
month
of
safety
data
for
full
approval
regardless
our
team
would
follow
up
with
the
enrol
participant
for
two
year
the
statistical
analysis
that
our
mathematician
perform
indicate
that
for
this
level
of
efficacy
percent
they
would
need
a
total
of
at
least
event
of
covid
participant
who
get
the
disease
to
demonstrate
statistically
significant
efficacy
a
study
size
of
ten
thousand
to
fifteen
thousand
participant
could
potentially
generate
these
result
in
less
than
a
year
dependent
on
incidence
rate
of
disease
infection
they
decide
to
blow
out
the
study
size
and
go
for
thirty
thousand
participant
so
they
could
accumulate
covid
event
faster
later
we
increase
this
number
to
over
forty
six
thousand
a
study
of
this
size
usually
involves
to
research
site
they
decide
to
target
site
so
they
could
recruit
these
participant
faster
later
we
increase
this
number
to
but
the
most
critical
factor
be
to
select
research
site
in
area
where
there
would
be
a
heavy
covid
disease
burden
so
the
attack
rate
percentage
of
participant
who
contract
the
disease
naturally
during
the
study
period
would
be
high
if
you
have
low
attack
rate
and
as
a
result
few
people
get
sick
you
cannot
be
sure
if
your
vaccine
provide
protection
we
need
high
disease
intensity
for
the
clinical
study
to
demonstrate
that
vaccinate
people
be
well
protect
than
the
placebo
recipient
the
problem
be
that
the
attack
rate
for
different
location
be
change
over
time
when
a
city
or
county
have
a
lot
of
infection
they
would
usually
take
policy
measure
and
the
attack
rate
would
drop
after
a
period
of
time
on
the
contrary
when
a
city
or
county
do
not
have
many
infection
people
would
start
to
relax
and
the
covid
infection
rate
there
would
climb
high
over
time
how
would
our
researcher
know
where
to
place
our
research
site
so
they
would
have
access
to
high
attack
rate
within
the
time
that
be
need
at
least
seven
day
after
the
second
dose
our
epidemiologist
developed
an
algorithm
that
could
predict
as
accurately
as
possible
the
area
where
covid
attack
rate
could
rise
at
certain
period
of
time
the
research
team
would
then
try
to
open
investigation
site
accordingly
so
that
by
the
time
the
participant
have
receive
their
second
dos
the
chance
of
high
disease
burden
would
be
great
as
the
team
continued
articulate
their
plan
i
be
think
wow
after
the
vaccine
team
complete
their
presentation
mike
mcdermott
the
head
of
manufacturing
take
the
floor
while
the
lab
would
prepare
the
vaccine
candidate
to
be
test
in
phase
and
phase
study
the
manufacturing
team
would
start
work
to
scale
up
the
manufacturing
process
even
without
know
which
candidate
would
be
eventually
select
they
would
need
to
order
raw
material
for
all
candidate
to
be
ready
for
all
scenario
and
they
would
eventually
have
to
dispose
of
those
that
be
specific
to
the
candidate
not
select
our
challenge
be
that
there
be
no
industrial
production
anywhere
in
the
world
of
any
mrna
product
medicine
or
vaccine
until
now
we
have
only
produce
mrna
in
laboratory
at
small
scale
for
research
need
our
manufacturing
team
would
have
to
invent
design
and
order
new
industrial
formulation
equipment
that
didn
t
currently
exist
mike
confirm
that
our
engineer
have
already
start
the
design
work
for
the
formulation
equipment
and
have
begin
discussion
with
specialized
equipment
producer
to
understand
what
it
would
take
to
build
these
machine
fast
what
about
the
challenge
with
the
ultracold
storage
requirement
i
ask
how
would
you
store
million
of
dos
at
negative
seventy
degree
celsius
thanks
for
ask
for
storage
we
have
a
good
solution
we
will
move
material
for
our
exist
product
out
of
our
current
warehouse
to
temporary
location
and
convert
these
warehouse
to
freezer
farm
each
the
size
of
a
football
field
freezer
farm
i
ask
yes
freezer
farm
we
will
install
five
hundred
big
freezer
that
each
have
the
capacity
to
store
three
hundred
thousand
dos
in
total
we
can
store
over
one
hundred
million
dos
there
we
will
do
the
same
in
our
manufacturing
site
in
belgium
for
the
european
production
i
thought
he
could
drop
the
microphone
there
but
he
continued
of
course
you
will
now
ask
me
how
we
will
ship
under
these
ultracold
requirement
million
of
dos
to
thousand
of
location
around
the
world
this
be
a
big
challenge
indeed
as
you
know
there
be
no
car
or
airplane
that
can
hold
these
low
temperature
so
send
them
the
same
way
we
send
other
vaccine
or
medicine
that
require
cold
chain
won
t
work
by
think
out
of
the
box
we
realize
that
the
solution
be
inside
a
box
what
if
we
have
a
container
that
be
relatively
low
cost
and
could
maintain
temperature
of
negative
seventy
degree
celsius
for
let
s
say
one
to
two
week
we
can
do
that
by
fill
them
with
dry
ice
my
heart
be
fill
with
joy
but
i
interrupt
him
to
ask
what
i
thought
would
be
a
challenge
question
where
be
you
go
to
find
that
much
dry
ice
we
calculate
that
we
would
need
one
to
two
percent
of
the
us
dry
ice
supply
the
problem
be
more
logistical
but
we
have
a
solution
we
will
start
manufacturing
dry
ice
in
our
facility
and
use
it
on
site
i
thought
that
be
bold
and
ask
him
to
continue
we
could
send
these
box
with
normal
vehicle
train
or
airplane
to
any
location
in
the
world
upon
arrival
they
could
either
store
them
in
special
freezer
that
be
commercially
available
or
keep
them
in
the
box
for
longer
by
replenish
the
dry
ice
i
ask
our
engineer
to
start
the
design
of
a
box
like
this
that
in
fact
can
be
reusable
we
would
also
have
in
the
box
an
electronic
device
that
have
gps
thermometer
and
light
detector
the
device
would
transmit
in
real
time
the
location
and
the
temperature
to
our
control
center
if
someone
open
the
box
the
light
detector
will
also
transmit
this
information
to
us
albert
we
would
know
everything
about
each
box
that
be
travel
around
the
world
until
it
reach
its
destination

the

could

as
much
as

i
congratulate
the
team
thanked
them
and
give
them
the
go
ahead
i
take
a
note
to
inform
our
board
of
director
of
this
decision
it
be
a
very
expensive
bet
and
i
knew
that
it
would
be
painful
to
take
a
billion
write
off
in
my
second
year
as
ceo
if
the
project
fail
but
i
also
knew
that
it
would
not
take
the
company
down
and
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
i
call
our
lead
director
shantanu
narayen
to
discus
it
with
him
shantanu
be
the
chairman
and
ceo
of
adobe
and
since
i
become
ceo
he
have
be
a
mentor
to
me
he
be
the
voice
of
reason
and
he
have
a
unique
ability
to
bring
people
together
which
he
do
often
with
the
other
director
of
pfizer
s
board
he
listen
carefully
and
he
agree
with
me
that
this
plan
be
the
right
thing
to
do
i
then
call
a
few
other
board
member
to
make
sure
they
agree
it
be
obvious
that
everyone
be
get
very
worried
about
the
spread
of
the
disease
around
the
world
and
felt
that
pfizer
could
and
should
play
a
role
and
the
criticality
of
the
situation
call
for
an
all
in
approach
a
few
day
later
i
announce
to
the
world
our
intention
to
discover
a
vaccine
against
the
global
pandemic
by
the
end
of
october

lightspeed
the
fight
doesn
t
wait
for
those
who
delay
aeschylus
bc
on
march
we
held
a
meeting
focus
exclusively
on
the
vaccine
on
my
calendar
it
read
simply
covid
vaccine
plan
after
that
the
session
become
a
swat
team
meeting
that
to
this
day
we
call
project
lightspeed
and
it
appear
as
such
on
my
daily
calendar
it
be
apparently
a
coincidence
that
a
few
month
later
the
trump
administration
use
the
name
operation
warp
speed
for
their
covid
response
task
force
our
project
be
name
lightspeed
to
make
expectation
clear
to
all
participant
everyone
should
adopt
the
energy
of
light
speed
mile
per
second
to
progress
their
work
but
even
if
everyone
be
do
so
still
that
would
not
be
enough
a
project
team
have
its
own
dynamic
which
cause
event
to
move
at
the
speed
of
the
team
rather
than
the
speed
of
the
individual
the
work
of
one
be
dependent
on
the
work
of
the
others
when
commit
individual
come
together
the
force
and
effect
of
their
collective
effort
accelerate
even
more
that
be
the
sum
be
great
than
the
part
and
in
our
case
fast
decision
make
by
a
dedicate
and
motivate
team
would
be
the
key
determinant
of
success
for
this
project
usually
in
the
corporate
world
you
need
multiple
discipline
to
be
consult
before
any
decision
can
be
make
but
the
big
challenge
for
every
corporation
be
to
reach
a
decision
among
peer
who
disagree
this
be
the
reason
why
in
when
i
be
the
head
of
our
biopharmaceutical
business
pfizer
innovative
health
i
have
broken
the
division
into
six
business
unit
each
of
which
have
relative
autonomy
to
make
tactical
decision
within
their
budget
vaccine
be
one
of
them
in
addition
to
oncology
internal
medicine
rare
disease
inflammation
immunology
and
consumer
healthcare
i
told
the
global
president
of
these
business
unit
that
they
should
each
consider
their
unit
like
an
entrepreneurial
biotech
company
with
the
president
of
each
business
unit
act
as
ceo
and
with
me
in
the
role
of
the
ceo
of
a
private
equity
firm
that
own
them
a
private
equity
firm
do
three
thing
with
the
biotech
they
own
i
told
them
first
it
appoints
their
management
i
have
appoint
you
second
it
agrees
with
their
management
on
the
strategic
direction
we
have
discuss
and
have
clear
alignment
on
the
strategic
direction
that
each
one
of
you
should
follow
third
it
allocates
capital
to
them
you
will
have
to
compete
for
that
the
best
proposal
will
get
the
funding
every
month
i
would
review
in
a
committee
their
request
for
investment
in
research
project
manufacturing
infrastructure
and
commercial
expenditure
and
i
would
allocate
capital
to
their
approve
project
then
i
would
leave
them
relatively
alone
to
execute
their
plan
while
i
monitor
metric
and
outcome
but
even
after
we
implement
this
system
most
of
a
business
unit
s
decision
be
still
quite
complex
and
require
broader
consultation
in
a
matrix
of
multiple
stakeholder
decision
still
depend
on
painstakingly
slow
diplomacy
and
multiple
compromise
otherwise
thing
could
stop
it
might
feel
counterintuitive
but
this
be
even
more
so
when
high
level
executive
be
involve
in
a
project
when
a
decision
make
by
a
multidisciplinary
team
at
a
low
level
reach
the
next
management
layer
it
be
a
common
theme
that
one
of
the
boss
will
have
a
different
opinion
cause
thing
to
pause
when
eventually
the
disagreement
be
resolve
the
decision
go
to
the
next
management
layer
and
very
often
the
scenario
be
repeat
the
new
approach
i
have
implement
have
improve
our
agility
and
the
speed
of
our
decision
make
but
for
a
project
like
lightspeed
we
face
great
level
of
complexity
than
ever
before
but
still
need
to
reach
decision
even
faster
than
ever
for
example
we
have
to
consult
many
different
scientist
from
different
research
group
engineer
and
other
supply
leader
from
different
specialized
manufacturing
group
lawyer
commercial
colleague
financial
people
communication
people
and
the
list
go
on
and
on
all
these
people
be
vital
to
the
decision
make
process
as
we
be
deal
with
very
complicate
topic
that
require
their
very
specific
expertise
but
get
all
of
them
to
agree
before
the
team
could
move
to
the
next
step
be
imperative
we
could
not
afford
to
let
bureaucracy
or
ego
slow
us
down
we
need
to
replace
hierarchical
process
simplify
the
chain
of
command
and
merge
three
to
four
layer
of
management
into
one
fast
move
project
team
that
could
make
decision
on
the
spot
we
held
meeting
twice
weekly
from
to
p
m
though
often
the
meeting
ran
overtime
i
lead
the
meeting
research
manufacturing
finance
legal
and
corporate
affair
be
all
represent
with
two
three
or
more
layer
of
management
as
need
i
act
as
the
project
manager
i
confess
that
i
be
not
the
best
project
manager
i
m
okay
at
it
but
the
value
i
brought
be
different
the
ceo
can
knock
down
silo
hear
everyone
out
and
quickly
move
thing
forward
everyone
on
this
team
be
encourage
to
agree
or
disagree
oppose
or
encourage
no
matter
their
position
but
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
decision
could
be
make
fast
because
i
be
there
and
have
the
authority
to
make
them
in
typical
meeting
with
the
ceo
people
usually
have
a
lot
of
premeetings
to
align
before
the
main
meeting
with
this
project
they
have
very
little
time
for
that
data
flow
and
decision
be
make
in
real
time
we
have
a
just
in
time
mentality
not
everyone
felt
at
ease
with
this
at
the
begin
it
can
be
uncomfortable

cross
the
line
as
fast
as
possible
with
a

in
the

that
follow
every

we
happy
with
how
rigorous
the

be
at
a

why
be
we
not
recruiting

we

let
s
review
again
the
intricacy
of
the
fda
s
emergency
use
authorization
where
be
we
on
this
provision
what
be
the
late
with
the
center
for
biologics
evaluation
and
research
cber
at
the
fda

we
prepared
for
the

at

the
question
kept
come
after
a
long
day
netflix
provide
distraction
and
a
respite
from
endless
meeting
and
preparation
i
d
leave
my
home
office
stop
in
the
kitchen
to
get
a
glass
of
cold
chardonnay
walk
into
the
family
room
sit
down
on
the
couch
and
watch
an
episode
of
game
of
throne
or
a
french
spy
thriller
the
bureau
the
kid
thought
it
be
funny
that
my
wife
myriam
and
i
would
binge
on
gilmore
girl
a
comedy
drama
that
remind
us
that
there
be
other
problem
in
the
world
sometimes
i
would
pause
the
show
reach
for
my
phone
and
facetime
with
a
colleague
to
discus
an
idea
or
resolve
a
problem
or
i
would
jot
a
note
for
the
next
day
between
show
i
might
call
friend
or
sit
and
speak
with
myriam
to
hear
about
her
day
if
ever
i
think
that
i
be
busy
i
remember
how
hard
she
work
to
take
care
of
all
of
us
always
with
a
smile
and
always
with
positivity
when
i
speak
about
her
with
our
closest
friend
i
describe
her
as
someone
between
superwoman
and
mother
teresa
in
meeting
after
meeting
i
found
myself
curious
but
also
impatient
i
be
get
fascinate
by
the
detail
of
this
cut
edge
technology
and
be
ask
question
to
understand
it
well
sometimes
i
would
ask
these
question
during
the
meeting
but
many
time
i
would
call
an
expert
afterward
and
ask
him
or
her
to
give
me
detail
or
explanation
for
something
that
be
discuss
in
the
meeting
i
save
those
question
for
after
the
meeting
so
that
i
do
not
waste
everybody
s
time
i
also
constantly
question
every
step
of
the
process
and
challenged
every
single
timeline
if
someone
say
it
would
take
week
i
ask
why
it
couldn
t
be
do
in
two
day
this
could
be
irritate
to
many
at
the
begin
but
pretty
soon
it
become
second
nature
for
the
team
to
come
proactively
with
solution
that
would
speed
up
our
timeline
often
attach
to
a
hefty
request
for
additional
funding
but
money
be
not
the
issue
here
time
be
very
frequently
when
approve
the
additional
investment
i
would
tell
this
team
time
be
life
repurposing
the
expression
time
be
money
after
a
few
meeting
it
become
clear
to
all
what
be
expect
look
back
i
think
this
attitude
time
be
life
be
the
most
important
success
factor
for
this
project
set
goal
that
be
very
aspirational
goal
that
someone
have
never
achieve
before
can
unleash
human
creativity
in
phenomenal
way
when
you
ask
people
to
do
in
eight
year
something
that
normally
take
ten
they
will
find
it
challenge
but
they
will
think
of
solution
within
the
current
process
if
you
ask
them
to
make
three
hundred
million
dos
instead
of
two
hundred
million
that
be
our
current
annual
capacity
at
that
time
they
will
find
it
hard
but
will
investigate
solution
that
improve
the
current
way
of
do
thing
they
may
achieve
something
well
by
do
so
but
usually
these
process
have
be
optimize
over
year
and
there
be
only
so
much
you
can
do
to
deliver
more
however
in
this
case
i
didn
t
ask
people
to
do
it
in
eight
year
i
ask
them
to
do
it
in
eight
month
i
didn
t
ask
them
to
make
three
hundred
million
dos
i
ask
them
to
make
three
billion
dos
and
i
insist
that
these
target
be
not
negotiable
it
be
clear
from
the
begin
that
incremental
improvement
would
not
make
the
cut
they
need
to
completely
rethink
their
process
they
have
to
redesign
them
from
scratch
and
be
creative
at
every
single
new
step
of
a
new
process
and
they
do
it
on
april
we
announce
that
german
authority
have
approve
the
start
of
our
study
to
evaluate
the
four
vaccine
construct
against
covid
and
the
study
begin
the
follow
day
we
have
developed
four
vaccine
candidate
each
represent
a
unique
mrna
format
and
target
antigen
combination
two
of
the
four
vaccine
candidate
include
a
nucleoside
modify
mrna
modrna
one
include
a
uridine
contain
mrna
urna
and
the
fourth
vaccine
candidate
utilized
self
amplify
mrna
sarna
each
mrna
format
be
combine
with
a
lipid
nanoparticle
formulation
two
of
the
vaccine
candidate
encode
an
optimize
full
length
spike
protein
and
the
other
two
candidate
encode
the
receptor
binding
domain
rbd
of
the
spike
protein
the
rbd
base
candidate
contain
a
piece
of
the
spike
that
be
thought
to
be
important
for
elicit
antibody
that
could
inactivate
the
virus
while
the
longer
spike
protein
be
thought
to
be
important
for
elicit
a
broader
or
more
differentiate
antibody
response
the
first
study
in
human
be
meant
to
compare
the
four
candidate
at
different
dose
level
the
dose
escalation
portion
of
the
phase
trial
include
approximately
two
hundred
healthy
subject
age
eighteen
to
fifty
five
and
target
a
dose
range
of
one
microgram
g
to
one
hundred
g
aim
to
determine
the
optimal
dose
for
far
study
as
well
as
evaluate
the
safety
and
immunogenicity
of
the
vaccine
candidate
the
study
also
evaluate
the
effect
of
repeat
immunization
for
three
of
the
four
vaccine
candidate
in
late
may
we
begin
to
test
these
four
different
vaccine
in
phase
traditionally
those
would
have
be
test
sequentially
but
we
decide
to
test
them
in
parallel
four
different
vaccine
candidate
each
at
three
different
dosage
level
such
an
effort
might
take
a
year
under
normal
circumstance
we
do
it
in
a
month
by
late
july
we
be
prepared
for
a
combine
phase
and
trial
in
which
eventually
over
patient
would
be
recruit
at
clinical
site
in
six
country
as
july
approach
our
target
date
for
start
the
pivotal
phase
efficacy
phase
we
face
yet
another
vex
decision
we
have
two
promising
final
candidate
two
different
vaccine
formulation
the
first
know
as
b
be
the
one
that
use
only
the
rbd
of
the
sars
cov
spike
protein
this
candidate
have
the
most
data
and
appear
to
be
an
excellent
choice
the
second
know
as
b
be
the
one
that
use
the
full
length
spike
protein
it
appear
to
have
a
broader
immune
response
with
few
tolerability
issue
few
chill
and
few
headache
very
preliminary
data
be
also
indicate
that
it
might
be
potentially
more
potent
in
old
adult
who
be
more
susceptible
to
severe
covid
in
the
first
place
and
whose
immunity
be
more
difficult
to
boost
however
b
be
more
difficult
to
produce
and
with
less
overall
data
available
it
be
a
much
riskier
choice
data
for
the
first
be
far
along
because
test
for
that
candidate
have
start
earlier
data
for
the
second
lag
with
a
key
deadline
approach
we
would
have
to
decide
which
vaccine
we
move
forward
with
in
phase
test
it
be
like
have
two
puzzle
one
with
more
piece
assemble
that
be
reveal
a
beautiful
picture
and
another
with
far
few
assemble
piece
but
reveal
a
picture
with
more
vivid
color
we
huddle
together
as
a
team
study
the
data
we
have
and
project
what
be
possible
even
though
there
be
a
lot
of
white
space
in
the
second
puzzle
it
appear
to
be
more
promising
with
our
original
deadline
approach
we
decide
to
wait
another
week
for
more
data
because
we
sense
that
the
choice
we
make
would
make
a
huge
difference
in
the
success
of
the
vaccine
postpone
our
deadline
by
a
week
on
this
project
be
a
very
big
decision
in
fact
i
don
t
recall
make
any
other
decision
to
delay
a
timeline
of
project
lightspeed
by
a
week
not
even
by
a
day
for
ten
day
we
deliberate
fret
and
deliberate
some
more
should
we
pick
the
one
that
we
know
be
good
enough
or
do
we
reach
for
something
that
might
work
well
eighty
percent
of
the
data
we
have
be
from
b
and
we
couldn
t
afford
the
time
to
develop
additional
data
for
b
every
day
delayed
equal
the
loss
of
many
human
life
some
of
the
team
felt
that
b
would
be
good
enough
others
be
not
convince
still
others
be
concerned
that
we
be
lose
time
go
after
something
perfect
perfect
be
usually
the
enemy
of
good
they
would
say
it
be
true
that
substantial
work
would
be
require
of
pfizer
to
take
the
b
construct
and
make
it
commercially
viable
to
manufacture
it
at
scale
with
consistency
in
a
critical
meeting
on
july
argument
in
favor
and
against
each
of
the
two
candidate
be
summarize
for
the
last
time
by
the
study
team
the
most
recent
data
only
a
few
hour
old
be
also
present
it
be
time
for
a
decision
in
my
computer
monitor
i
could
see
all
eye
look
at
me
i
have
to
make
the
final
call
i
make
the
riskier
decision
you
have
do
an
excellent
job
articulate
the
pro
and
con
of
both
candidate
i
told
the
team
i
feel
that
most
of
you
believe
that
the
best
option
be
the
second
one
let
s
go
with
the
b
candidate
and
let
s
hope
we
be
right
in
the
month
to
come
we
held
our
breath
that
the
phase
efficacy
and
safety
data
would
justify
our
decision
because
once
we
start
down
this
path
there
be
no
turn
back
it
be
an
amaze
relief
when
we
finally
could
see
the
beautiful
data
set
from
the
vaccine
trial
that
have
enrol
over
trial
participant
and
we
be
able
to
take
that
to
the
fda
and
ask
for
emergency
use
authorization
the
phase
study
start
immediately
ugur
and
i
discuss
the
importance
of
diversity
in
our
clinical
trial
at
the
start
of
our
partnership
and
we
agree
during
the
spring
that
we
need
to
set
the
pace
for
racial
representation
we
worried
about
vaccine
hesitancy
among
black
and
brown
people
around
the
world
if
their
community
be
not
represent
in
the
research
we
welcome

insistence
that
it
be
a
priority
for
every

could
quantify
the
impact
of
our
ongoing
effort
to
improve
racial
and
ethnic
diversity
in
clinical
trial
but
the
covid
vaccine
trial
be
not
any
average
trial
it
be
the
most
important
trial
in
the
world
at
that
time
and
we
have
to
get
diversity
right
of
course
we
encourage
everyone
to
be
represent
but
the
choice
to
participate
in
a
clinical
trial
be
a
personal
one
and
many
time
can
be
driven
by
bias
or
misinformation
we
have
to
do
more
about
it
a
star
in
this
effort
be
sandy

who
manages

and
show
our
kid
that
hard

can
change
the
world
she

work
alongside
the
entire
team
sandy

mission
be

achieve
statistically
diverse

on
equity
and
inclusion
support
our
clinical
team
to
have
the
right
representation
of
participant
the
goal
of
diversify
clinical
trial
be
to
well
understand
how
a
therapy
or
vaccine
affect
people
of
different
age
race
ethnicity
and
gender
in
order
to
detect
any
safety
or
efficacy
difference
in
particular
population
in
sandy
s
own
word
we
have
to
let
the
science
drive
us
and
this
be
a
philosophy
we
at
pfizer
have
built
into
the
fiber
of
how
we
operate
in
addition
to
follow
the
data
sandy
and
her
team
also
recognize
the
importance
of
community
engagement
work
with
multicultural
advocacy
partner
medical
institution
and
legislative
organization
to
educate
and
encourage
people
who
be
at
the
high
risk
or
be
historically
underrepresented
in
clinical
trial
to
participate
this
be
exactly
what
she
do
to
ensure
diversity
in
our
covid
vaccine
phase
trial
through
a
very
broad
outreach
we
recruit
patient
in
african
american
community
in
new
orleans
and
atlanta
native
american
in
the
navajo
nation
and
hispanic
latinx
people
in
city
and
rural
area
nationwide
this
be
very
important
the
navajo
nation
for
example
would
go
on
to
outpace
the
us
overall
in
the
rate
of
vaccination
when
the
vaccine
become
available
in
the
end
percent

and
approximately
percent
of
us
participant
come
from
diverse
background
geographically
racially
and
across
age
group
these
effort
and
particularly
these
result
didn
t
go
unnoticed
in
the
spring
of
a
lead

company
in
the

to
the
second
among
fourteen
in
big

for
endless
week
and
month
whenever
someone
raise
a
complication
a
hurdle
or
a
challenge
i
would
respond
people
be
die
there
be
no
excuse
solve
it
i
knew
this
be
a
kind
of
psychological
or
emotional
blackmail
but
it
be
unfortunately
true
kathrin
live
in
new
york
city
near
a
hospital
and
would
tell
us
many
time
as
we
be
wait
for
people
to
gather
so
we
could
start
a
meeting
that
when
she
would
go
for
walk
during
the
lockdown
she
d
notice
the
refrigerate
makeshift
morgue
at
what
be
then
the
epicenter
of
the
pandemic
i
would
refer
to
her
description
many
time
during
our
lightspeed
meeting
i
truly
felt
bad
remind
people
about
the
stake
in
such
a
graphic
way
but
i
also
couldn
t
resist
because
it
be
so
effective
people
be
give
percent
of
themselves
because
they
knew
that
time
be
life
and
of
course
the
pressure
to
keep
timeline
and
deliver
outcome
be
relentless
look
back
i
never
regret
that
i
push
people
hard
i
know
that
without
my
do
so
we
would
have
never
succeed
and
the
world
would
have
be
in
a
very
difficult
place
today
the
wall
street
journal
would
later
report
on
pfizer
s
crazy
deadline
and
its
pushy
ceo
but
i
truly
regret
that
on
several
occasion
i
become
unnecessarily
unpleasant
i
let
the
stress
show
rather
than
hide
it
and
know
that
i
do
that
to
people
who
be
work
day
and
night
make
it
even
more
regrettable
at
that
moment
most
be
feel
that
i
push
too
hard
but
later
when
they
be
accomplish
more
than
they
thought
they
could
they
all
take
such
great
pride
in
the
impact
they
have
on
the
world
that
they
forgave
me
but
they
didn
t
forget
at
pfizer
all
manager
be
rat
every
six
month
by
their
team
on
how
they
live

s
four
value
courage
excellence
equity
and
joy
i
have
always
perform
at
the
top
of
the
company
in
all
these
value
but
in
the
survey
result
i
receive
in
late
my
joy
score
plummet
it
be
not
that
i
have
be
tough
people
could
accept
that
in
the
middle
of
a
pandemic
even
welcome
it
but
there
be
time
i
d
lose
my
temper
in
front
of
colleague
i
forgot
to
recognize
the
hard
work
of
someone
because
i
be
too
busy
resolve
the
issue
of
another
some
cultural
difference
make
this
even
more
profound
in
my
mediterranean
culture
you
use
your
voice
for
emphasis
and
meaning
and
this
can
be
very
annoy
for
people
from
other
cultural
background
i
can
be
an
explosive
personality
in
fact
over
the
year
i
have
to
tone
this
down
a
lot
in
order
to
survive
in
the
corporate
environment
of
a
global
company
particularly
when
i
arrive
in
the
us
but
now
the
weight
on
my
shoulder
of
this
big
responsibility
have
betrayed
me
and
i
d
give
grief
to
many
people
who
didn
t
deserve
it
i
reflect
on
the
feedback
i
receive
and
clearly
the
review
be
correct
i
present
these
result
to
my
team
and
told
them
how
much
i
regret
let
them
down
stressful
situation
test
human
character
but
i
should
have
know
well
human
can
learn
from
their
mistake
and
i
become
determine
to
not
let
this
happen
again

project
lightspeed
met
for
our
regularly
schedule
session
it
have
be
two
day
since
the
contest
presidential
election
this
meeting
be
to
learn
when
we
would
have
enough
data
to
unblind
the
vaccine
trial
result
and
decide
whether
we
could
move
forward
on
an
emergency
use
authorization
application
it
become
clear
that
we
be
close
by
sunday
night
we
would
know
in
the
hour
lead
up
to
the
readout
on
the
clinical
trial
data
a
small
group
within
the
clinical
development
team
quietly
unblinded
the
trial
data
to
tabulate
effectiveness
result
and
report
to
the
data
monitoring
committee
that
sunday
november
would
be
the
readout
of
data
to
our
executive
team
our
first
glimpse
at
what
these
nine
month
of
research
and
development
would
mean
they
set
a
time
for
sunday
afternoon
behind
the
scene
they
scramble
to
collate
and
tabulate
ream
of
data
from
test
site
around
the
world
they
work
around
the
clock
later
i
would
learn
that
one
data
analyst
receive
his
data
packet
at
a
m
but
suddenly
lose
wi
fi
connectivity
at
his
house
he
have
to
drive
around
town
in
the
middle
of
the
night
look
for
wi
fi
in
order
to
meet
his
deadline
of
hand
off
data
to
the
next
stage
of
analysis
by
in
the
morning
he
found
a
gas
station
close
for
the
night
with
a
weak
signal
barely
discernible
outside
the
garage
as
he
crunched
the
number
from
his
car
a
police
officer
pull
into
the
station
to
ask
him
what
he
be
do
when
the
analyst
explain
to
the
officer
he
be
work
on
the
vaccine
the
officer
stayed
with
him
to
make
sure
he
be
safe
his
data
packet
be
transmit
in
time
on
saturday
november
the
day
before
i
have
to
work
hard
to
preoccupy
myself
the
sunny
late
fall
day
do
little
to
brighten
my
spirit
the
tumultuous
presidential
election
of
which
have
politicize
our
vaccine
effort
have
just
end
a
few
day
earlier
sort
of
and
like
everyone
else
around
the
country
i
be
on
pin
and
needle
but
for
me
the
anxiety
for
result
extend
beyond
politics
the
week
be
end
with
news
that
more
than
american
have
contract
covid
in
a
single
day
the
high
number
of
new
case
on
any
single
day
of
the
pandemic
those
number
would
continue
to
skyrocket
as
the
ceo
of
pfizer
this
news
hit
me
as
a
personal
affront
i
felt
tremendous
responsibility
only
a
few
of
us
inside
pfizer
alongside
our
partner
at
biontech
in
germany
knew
that
the
next
day
sunday
november
would
be
when
we
would
learn
the
result
of
our
phase
trial
of
our
mrna
base
vaccine
dozen
of
question
be
come
to
my
mind
have
we
be
right
to
select
the
mrna
technology
be
the
decision
to
select
candidate
b
instead
of
candidate
b
wise
maybe
we
should
have
chosen
boost
with
a
second
dose
twenty
eight
day
later
like
everyone
else
instead
of
twenty
one
and
why
have
we
chosen
to
test
result
seven
day
after
the
second
dose
instead
of
wait
fourteen
day
when
the
immune
response
would
be
high
everyone
else
be
test
at
fourteen
day
be
we
brave
or
arrogant
the
next
morning
i
drove
to
one
of
our
satellite
office
in
connecticut
an
hour
northeast
of
new
york
city
to
gather
with
a
small
team
to
learn
the
result
we
have
invest
our
people
s
passion
our
science
and
our
technology
in
a
gamble
with
enormous
implication
for
our
company
and
for
humanity
my
car
arrive
at
the
office
simultaneously
with
mikael
dolsten
s
when
we
met
outside

realize
that
although
we
have
be

together
every
day
very
intensely
for
the
past
eight
month

d
be
physically
together
in
month
we
have
make
countless
decision
together
and
we
have
developed
a
breakthrough
vaccine
candidate
the
result
of
which
be
just
about
to
be
read
out
but
in
all
this
time
we
have
not
met
in
person
i
have
met
physically
on
occasion
with
other
member
of
my
team
but
mikael
be
very
careful
because
of
a
personal
situation
at

few
long

time
we
continued
to
chat
mikael
be
sit
right
next
to
me
i
ask
him
to
predict
the
level
of
efficacy
we
would
hear
from
the
trial
he
squirm
in
his
chair
and
with
some
hesitation
say
percent
i
thought
i
hope
he
be
right
finally
the
researcher
with
the
finding
connect
we
try
to
read
body
language
but
they
be
not
reveal
much
there
be
that
moment
in
movie
about
space
exploration
when
mission
control
anxiously
pause
for
the
crackle
of
sound
from
a
distant
astronaut
call
from
a
capsule
that
have
safely
land
or
pass
to
the
other
side
of

clinical
research
and
development
say
good
news
the
study
be
successful
the
committee
of
independent
expert
that
review
the
unblinded
data
strongly
advises
us
to
submit
immediately
a
request
for
emergency
use
authorization
strongly
and
immediately
be
unusually
potent
word
for
this
committee
their
terminology
over
the
course
of
these
trial
have
always
be
careful
appropriately
sparse
clinical
but
now
we
could
sense
their
enthusiasm
we
jumped
from
our
chair
and
start
celebrate
sally
doug
and
yolanda
be
scream
i
felt
like
i
be
wear
one
of
those
wingsuits
fly
above
mountain
and
green
valley
within
moment
yolanda
appear
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
that
she
have
already
chill
in
anticipation
of
what
she
hop
would
be
positive
result
as
we
toast
this
amaze
moment
i
remember
my
eye
be
drawn
to
the
two
pfizer
executive
protection
officer
who
be
with
us
that
day
they
be
silent
as
they
usually
be
but
they
have
realize
what
be
happen
and
you
could
feel
that
they
be
seriously
move
one
of
them
almost
have
tear
in
his
eye
we
continued
celebrate
but
we
didn
t
know
yet
the
best
part
of
the
story
it
come
fifteen
minute
later
when
two
experienced
biostatisticians
one
of
whom
be
satrajit
roychoudhury
report
the
level
of
efficacy
to
doug
and
me
we
have
agree
that
only
he
and
i
would
listen
to
the
actual
efficacy
number
so
that
we
could
decide
how
to
proceed
with
this
potentially
material
information
everybody
else
left
the
room
and
doug
and
i
connect
to
another
video
call
to
hear
the
result
i
have
thought
that
north
of
percent
effectiveness
would
be
a
good
result
but
one
of
the
biostatisticians
told
us
from
the
ninety
four
case
of
confirm
covid
ninety
belong
to
the
placebo
group
i
be
shock
and
felt
i
d
misheard
so
i
abruptly
interject
do
you
say
nineteen
one
nine
no
ninety
nine
zero
but
what
be
the
efficacy
ninety
five
point
six
percent
sir
doug
and
i
remain
speechless
for
a
few
moment
how
conclusive
be
this
number
i
ask
the
statistical
significance
be
very
high
sir
one
of
them
reply
we
do
not
expect
this
number
to
change
much
when
we
have
all
the
one
hundred
sixty
four
case
accumulate
and
proceed
to
the
final
readout
we
thanked
the
biostatisticians
and
exit
the
video
doug
and
i
look
at
each
other
i
realize
that
we
be
probably
sit
on
the
most
material
information
in
the
world
the
responsibility
be
very
high
what
do
we
do
now
i
ask
him
this
information
will
have
a
significant
impact
on
public
health
and
will
affect
the
way
health
authority
think
and
plan
for
the
pandemic
we
must
disclose
it
immediately
i
nod
my
head
indicate
my
agreement
previously
i
have
discuss
with
moncef
slaoui
the
head
of
operation
warp
speed
ows
that
we
would
only
disclose
success
or
failure
in
the
interim
analysis
and
not
provide
a
specific
number
before
have
final
number
i
recall
moncef
assure
me
that
moderna
would
do
the
same
moncef
s
concern
appear
to
be
that
if
we
give
a
specific
efficacy
number
from
the
interim
analysis
and
the
final
analysis
be
one
to
two
point
different
that
could
confuse
the
public
but
we
be
all
think
between
percent
and
percent
efficacy
now
we
be
sit
on
news
that
health
official
around
the
world
need
to
know
and
prepare
for
a
vaccine
with
percent
efficacy
be
come
to
the
world
this
completely
change
the
landscape
doug
of
course
be
aware
of
what
we
have
discuss
what
about
what
we
discuss
with
moncef
i
ask
this
be
very
important
information
for
all
health
authority
in
the
world
doug
reply
we
must
get
it
out
there
immediately
i
reflect
for
a
moment
and
say
what
if
we
say
we
saw
more
than
ninety
percent
efficacy
this
will
give
the
world
a
clear
indication
about
the
magnitude
of
the
efficacy
without
disclose
a
specific
number
as
we
agree
with
moncef
that
will
work
doug
say
we
open
the
door
and
doug
go
to
the
other
meeting
room
to
call
mikael
sally
and
yolanda
into
our
room
we
close
the
door
and
the
first
thing
i
do
be
to
remind
mikael
of
his
previous
prediction
of
percent
efficacy
and
then
i
let
the
news
fly
mikael
it
be
more
than
ninety
percent
i
say
oh
my
god
he
scream
he
be
shock
like
everyone
else
in
the
room
they
just
couldn
t
believe
it
we
discuss
that
we
have
heard
the
actual
number
but
in
order
to
respect
our
discussion
with
operation
warp
speed
we
decide
to
announce
the
range
of
more
than
percent
i
be
surprised
when
a
few
week
later
moderna
announce
their
interim
result
with
a
specific
number
percent
which
differ
from
what
we
have
understood
the
agreement
to
be
with
ows
yolanda
initiate
the
disclosure
process
that
have
be
previously
agree
upon
we
have
to
assemble
a
meeting
with
the
pfizer
executive
leadership
team
follow
immediately
thereafter
by
a
meeting
with
the
board
we
have
to
finalize
press
release
and
many
other
thing
i
just
sat
in
the
room
for
a
few
more
minute
completely
amaze
my
mind
race
what
be
next
what
be
the
next
step
what
would
manufacturing
and
delivery
look
like
what
about
the
country
that
hadn
t
order
yet
everyone
would
want
to
have
it
now
would
we
have
adequate
quantity
to
supply
them
but
then
i
snap
back
to
the
present
who
just
sits
alone
in
a
room
during
such
a
historic
celebration
especially
a
greek
i
jumped
to
my
foot
and
go
to
see
doug
can
i
call
my
son
to
tell
him
i
ask
doug

all
these
month

down
to
my
little
office
where
he
could
eavesdrop
on
all
the
conversation
that
he
found
interest
he
have
become
my
trust
advisor
he
would
attend
almost
all
the
important
lightspeed
meeting
sit
in
the
back
of
the
room
behind
the
computer
camera
he
would
also
listen
to
many
of
my
call
with
the
head
of
many
country
at
the
end
of
each
meeting
or
call
i
would
ask
him
what
he
thought
and
we
would
discus
it
for
a
while
i
would
also
share
with
him
my
most
private
thought
about
this
project
and
particularly
my
deepest
worry
and
fear
talk
to
him
help
me
structure
my
think
and
see
thing
more
clearly
doug
knew
the
important
role
that
mois
have
played
in
support
me
all
these
month
and
he
clear
my
conversation
with
him
just
make
sure
he
doesn
t
tell
any
of
his
friend
today
before
the
news

heart
emoji

executive
leadership

an
hour
later
one
after
the
other
everyone
on
the
board
and
the
executive
leadership
team
be
anxious
to
hear
why
they
have
be
summon
suddenly
on
a
sunday
even
to
an
ad
hoc
meeting
they
didn
t
know
that
the
study
be
reading
out
that
day
but
they
knew
something
big
be
happen
probably
related
to
the
vaccine
development
but
before
go
into
these
meeting
i
have
to
make
a
special
call
in
germany
our
partner
ugur
ahin
ceo
of
biontech
be
wait
to
hear
the
result
i
call
him
from
a
small
side
office
near
the
conference
room
to
tell
him
the
incredible
news
in
fact
i
video
call
him
so
we
could
see
each
other
once
connect
we
spoke
softly
and
i
could
feel
the
emotion
rise
again
from
my
heart
to
my
throat
and
eye
i
sense
the
same
from
him
news
of
the
high
rate
of
effectiveness
wash
over
his
face
we
be
practically
in
tear
ugur
have
always
be
confident
but
this
be
overwhelm
we
spent
a
few
second
just
look
at
each
other
without
say
anything
but
with
both
of
us
sense
a
lot
ugur
told
me
many
month
later
that
our
conversation
felt
like
it
move
in
slow
motion
we
have
take
tremendous
risk
and
the
result
be
prove
us

chair
and
the
silence

me
i

proud
of

the
more
than

the
magnitude
of

and
our
achievement
thus
far
overwhelmed
me
and
my
heart
be
full
of
joy
in
that
quiet
poignant
moment

this

a
week
when
my

in
an
inevitable
but
unfortunate
way
my
predetermine
plan
to
sell

at
a
certain
price
be
trigger
when

briefly
hit
a
target
set
much
earlier
most
people
don
t
know
but
ceo
can
t
just
easily
sell
their
share
of
the
company
they
run
because
they
be
aware
of
so
much
material
information
they
may
be
face
with
allegation
that
their
sale
be
be
driven
by
inside
information
that
be
not
available
to
the
public
for
this
reason
lawyer
usually
recommend

time
in
the
future
and
the
limit
price
at
which
you
would
like
to
trigger
this
sale
at
pfizer
we
require
the
extra
precaution
that
the
sale
can
only
be
trigger
at
least
two
month
after
you
have
create
your
plan
this
creates
a
minimum
distance
of
two
month
between
when
you
set
the

price
and
when

even
knew
that
covid
would
become
a
pandemic
or
that
pfizer
could
be
work
on
a
vaccine
i
use

i
renew
the

use
our

for
the

remdesivir
mike
s
team
be
do
all
of
this
while
also
produce
medicine
essential
to
ease
mount
pressure
on
hospital
where
patient
be
go
on
ventilator
and
need
our
drug
for
sedation
muscle
relaxation
and
pain
relief
but
the
pressure
on
manufacturing
be
just
begin
at
first
when
the
team
learn
that
we
would
be
produce
a
vaccine
against
covid
there
be
tremendous
excitement
they
d
assume
it
would
take
research
and
development
a
year
or
more
to
discover
the
right
formulation
and
then
they
would
have
another
year
to
fill
and
package
the
final
product
but
that
be
not
the
timeline
i
d
envision
i
ask
our
team
to
put
their
best
people
on
the
project
parallel
track
and
not
let
money
be
a
factor
normally
we
would
pursue
r
d
and
manufacturing
sequentially
meaning
we
would
conduct
the
research
first
and
only
if
it
be
proven
to
be
successful
would
we
spend
the
resource
to
prepare
for
manufacturing
with
covid
we
didn
t
have
that
luxury
we
do
these
thing
in
parallel
result
in
a
much
big
expenditure
of
resource
but
it
didn
t
mean
we
would
cut
corner
safety
and
efficacy
be

i
ask
each
team
to
assemble
budget
for
what
they
would
need

grow
quickly
to

when
they
present
the
number
not
only
do
i
tell
them
that
they
have
that
amount
but
i
also
ask
them
what
they
would
need
to
move
even
faster
for
context
total
vaccine
production
at

at
this
point

prevnar
be
our
large

vaccine
and
it
have
take
ten
year
to
get
to
that
level
of

i
knew
that
we
would
need
to
double
our
overall
vaccine
production
in
just
nine
month
and
we
would
need
to
do
so
on
an
mrna

that
have
not
be

at
any

more

not
know
which
vaccine
candidate
it
would
eventually

they
d
have
to
build

for
four
different

approach
normally
they
would
execute
against

construct
be
narrow
to

before
we
ultimately

we
land

have
ask

perform
every

i
want
to

that
if
something
happen
to
one
facility
the
world
would
still
have
the
other
to
continue

i
want
also
to
ensure
that
we
have
separate
line
in
case
one
of
them
implement
export
restriction
a
precaution
that
later

to
have
take

the

be
follow
by
sterile

the
bulk

then
transfer
to
an

where
it
would
be
fill
into
a

there
it
would
undergo

the
rise

however
threaten
our
goal
some
country
in
an

protect

block
ingredient
and
substance
we
need
for
the

their
country
we
therefore
need
a
redundant

chain
just
in
case
one
country
or
a
block
of
country
be
to
lock
down
it
be
a
three
dimensional
puzzle
among
many
other
thing
we
need
glass
vial
and
stopper
to
cap
the

thankfully
not
only
be
we
one
of
the
large
buyer
of
those
but
we
also
have
great
relationship
with
supplier
the
key
ingredient
in
our
covid
vaccine
would
prove
to
be
lipid
remember
that
our
vaccine
us
lipid
nanoparticles
to
transport
mrna
to
instruct
cell
to
make
the
sars
cov
spike
protein
lipid
which
be
chemically
synthesize
become
the
most
important
constraint
to
solve
for
they
be
a
new
ingredient
not
use
at
scale
in
other
vaccine
to
make
matter
even
more
complex
there
be
four
different
lipid
need
two
be
proprietary
and
two
be
commodity
and
so
where
do
one
go
to
buy
large
volume
of
diverse
lipid
it
turn
out
not
many
place
on
the
commodity
side
niche
chemical
company
become
critical
partner
the
term
work
together
do
not
sufficiently
describe
the
extreme
collaboration
we
have
with
the
entire
biopharma
ecosystem
but
even
that
be
not
enough
we
would
have
to
get
into
the
production
business
ourselves
we
start
produce
our
own
lipid
to
increase
the
availability
and
ensure
production
continuity
we
start
do
this
in
groton
connecticut
and
eventually
in
other
place
as
well
we
usually
do
not
produce
raw
material
ourselves
but
this
be
not
business
as
usual
it
s
one
thing
to
make
an
mrna
lipid
nanoparticle
in
the
lab
for
research
purpose
it
s
quite
another
to
do
so
at
industrial
and
commercial
scale
during
the
research
phase
we
design
and
built
a
technical
solution
consist
of
a
set
of
high
pressure
pump
one
for
aqueous
material
and
another
for
organic
stream
and
a
computer
mouse
size
contraption
we
call
a
t
mixer
the
aqueous
and
organic
formula
be
pumped
into
the
t
mixer
and
the
internal
geometry
there
enables
the
formation
to
combine
into
the
lipid
nanoparticle
this
whole
process
be
control
by
artificial
intelligence
through
a
very
sophisticated
algorithm
that
be
cod
specifically
for
this
purpose
the
lipid
nanoparticle
be
then
purify
and
ultimately
fill
and
finish
into
the
final
product
you
see
in
glass
vial
as
we
set
our
sight
on
produce
large
and
large
volume
of
vaccine
we
become
concerned
about
the
capacity
of
our
already
overburden
supplier
the
solution
we
land
on
be
to
build
our
own
capacity
this
meant
replicate
the
pump
and
t
mixer

and
dozen

those

there
be
a

as
an

on
a

with

explore
with
our

the
limit

what
be
possible
at

it
be
like
pull

there
be
mutual
consternation
but
thing
be
move
in
an
impressive
way
in
the
early
day
of
the
crisis
we
set
two
hundred
million
dos
as
the
annual
goal
that
number
grow
quickly
to
five
hundred
million
and
then
i
d
ask
why
not
one
billion
when
that
be
accomplish
why
not
more
mike
told
me
that
what
we
re
do
already
be
a
miracle
you
be
never
satisfied
he
say
what
you
be
ask
be
impossible
both
statement
be
true
they
have
already
do
more
than
i
could
dream
when
we
start
this
journey
and
i
be
never
satisfied
i
kept
ask
for
more
but
i
knew
that
i
have
assemble
the
dream
team
these
men
and
woman
be
phenomenal
and
i
knew
we
could
do
it
in
fact
i
believe
that
we
be
the
only
one
who
could
do
it
thing
be
progress
but
there
be
a
lot
of
ups
and
down
and
i
be
relentless
in
keep
the
pressure
up
i
be
very
good
at
remember
number
when
a
projection
be
present
one
week
and
then
lower
without
explanation
the
follow
week
or

i
be
livid
the

on
the

don
t
match
the

your

at

eleven
be

what
you
show

you
should
have
these
change
up

and
highlight
not
bury
on
a
slide
in
the
middle
of
the
presentation
deck
please
don
t
do
this
again
you
know
how
well
i
remember
the
number
yolanda
finally
call
member
of
the
pfizer
global
supply
team
and
advise
them
to
just
call
me
before
the
meeting
if
a
number
be
change
wouldn
t
it
be
well
to
share
difficult
information
in
a
one
on
one
set
rather
than
on
the
team
call
she
ask
they
all
agree
that
it
make
sense
during
this
process
i
saw
mike
transform
into
one
of
the
best
leader
i
know
he
adopt
the
think
big
mindset
once
he
do
this
he
felt
liberate
he
would
set
bold
goal
and
take
ownership
of
find
solution
for
every
obstacle
that
could
stand
in
the
way
of
accomplish
them
i
remember
vividly
when
he
come
to
a
meeting
to
present
how
he
would
increase
production
to
three
billion
dos
in
one
of
the
other
challenge
would
be
that
if
we
need
to
increase
the
production
capacity
dramatically
we
would
need
many
replica
of
this
new
equipment
and
we
didn
t
have
enough
readily
available
space
in
our
manufacturing
site
i
will
have
to
build
new
formulation
site
mike
say
and
as
you
know
building
construction
take
year
and
before
i
could
ask
him
what
you
be
go
to
do
about
it
he
anticipate
my
question
but
we
have
a
solution
he
then
show
us
a
slide
with
a
car
assembly
line
that
be
operating
literally
under
a
tent
it
be
from
a
tesla
manufacturing
site
when
elon
musk
told
the
world
that
he
would
build
a
manufacturing
plant
for
make
tesla
car
in
a
year
no
one
believe
him
but
he
found
a
way
to
place
the
equipment
under
very
light
construction
mike
say
i
be
truly
impressed
by
this
opening
of
course
we
be
do
aseptic
formulation
and
we
cannot
host
our
new
formulation
suite
under
a
tent
but
the
concept
be
what
be
important
here
we
can
order
prefabricate
module
that
we
can
install
in
our
kalamazoo
manufacturing
site
within
month
not
year
there
be
a
producer
in
texas
that
make
them
we
can
give
him
specification
build
them
there
and
transfer
them
to
michigan
with
special
large
truck
we
will
have
to
do
the
transfer
at
night
and
we
would
need
the
police
force
of
several
state
to
cooperate
with
us
for
this
operation
but
it
can
be
do
it
would
take
us
month
instead
of
year
mike
say
he
continued
provide
technical
detail
about
the
fabrication
transport
and
assembly
of
these
prefabricate
unit
i
be
hearing
him
talk
and
be
feel
really
proud
of
him
this
liberate
version
of
mike
be
the
brilliant
leader
that
frank
d
amelio
and
i
have
see
when
we
appoint
him
as
the
head
of
our
manufacturing
group
in
early
we
commit
publicly
to
make
billion
dos
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
manufacturing
team
surprised
themselves
and
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
their
success
if
i
ve
learn
anything
during
my
twenty
eight
year
with
pfizer
it
be
that
people
will
tend
to
underestimate
what
they
can
achieve
and
in
an
organization
like
ours
the
people
below
them
will
underestimate
a
little
more
you
have
to
extend
yourself
you
can
do
more
than
you
think
you
can
people
can
push
themselves
more
than
they
think
possible
manufacturing
the
vaccine
have
left
us
with
a
product
as
fragile
as
a
snowflake
we
now
have
to
deliver
that
snowflake
with
great
care
around
the
world
which
we
would
accomplish
use
boat
truck
and
plane
get
the
product
right
in
the
early
phase
have
kept
me
awake
at
night
and
the
distribution
kept
me
pace
the
floor
at
all
hour
our
mrna
vaccine
have
to
be
store
and
ship
at
an
ultracold
temperature
minus
seventy
degree
celsius
negative
ninety
four
degree
fahrenheit
on
the

at
night
maybe
that
s
no
problem
on
earth
it
s
a
challenge
shipping
a
vaccine
at
this
temperature
at
scale
have
never
be
do
before
there
be
simply
no
infrastructure
to
support
it
imagine
have
a
rocket
the
vaccine
with
no
place
to
land
it
our
global
supply
chain
team
come
up
with
a
brilliant
solution
lead
by
a
man
who
become
know
as
the
ice
man
james
jean
our
engineer
design
a
temperature
control
thermal
shipper
that
could
transport
and
store
the
vaccine
anywhere
in
the
world
we
have
be
pilot
the
idea
before
covid
but
when
the
pandemic
struck
we
skip
the
test
phase
and
go
straight
to
full
implementation
the
shipper
about
the
size
of
a
carry
on
suitcase
weigh
about
seventy
five
pound
it
carry
a
minimum
of
one
tray
of
vaccine
vial
and
as
many
as
five
tray
each
tray
have
vial
dos
per
vial
so
a
single
shipper
could
carry
as
many
as
dos
we
capture
three
reading
location
temperature
and
light
gps
kept
us
inform
in
real
time
of
the
shipper
s
location
and
a
thermometer
kept
track
of
temperature
fluctuation
the
light
sensor
notify
us
if
the
shipper
be
open
or
crack
which
be
a
breach
of
security
to
monitor
all
of
this
data
imagine
a
computer
dashboard
with
a
map
of
the
world
at
any
moment
we
have
three
thousand
or
more
shipper
in
the
air
on
water
on
the
road
or
in
a
healthcare
facility
our
global
supply
chain
team
could
click
on
any
individual
shipper
and
see
its
current
temperature
and
location
as
well
as
the
milestone
it
have
achieve
and
any
exception
it
have
log
for
example
our
algorithm
capture
if
it
reach
certain
airport
on
time
the
truck
carry
the
shipper
might
have
be
divert
from
the
plan
route
due
to
weather
or
an
accident
if
someone
open
the
shipper
we
would
know
that
we
could
also
see
data
for
the
shipper
sit
right
next
to
it
so
we
d
notice
any
difference
between
shipper
on
the
same
vehicle
we
built
the
shipper
to
be
independent
from
the
shipping
company
carry
it
fedex
ups
and
united
airline
receive
the
same
alert
and
notification
we
do
but
we
be
never
dependent
on
a
single
carrier
separately
we
have
a
global
security
operation
team
that
notify
us
of
potential
or
real
threat
to
the
shipment
from
weather
and
political
or
social
unrest
in
the
early
day
while
we
be
test
the
system
we
have
an
open
line
at
all
time
for
our
logistics
expert
to
communicate
and
collaborate
if
we
discover
an
issue
en
route
we
could
stop
the
shipment
and
replace
it
with
a
new
delivery
if
necessary
the
system
be
so
intelligently
design
that
our
shipment
accuracy
be
percent
this
be
a
system
that
have
not
exist
in
what
we
might
now
call
the
pre
ice
age
now
the

can
even
serve
as
a

in

we
have
to
download
that

when
the

be
complete
and
then
look
backward
now
we
look
at
critical
data
in
real
time
so
we
can
react
correct
and
deliver
this
breakthrough

with

them
there
in
a
pandemic
we
be
all
only
as
protect
as
our
closest
neighbor
another
challenge
we
recognize
early
on
be
to
reduce
waste
and
increase
the
number
of
dos
per
vial
at
the
time
we
submit
our
first
regulatory
application
we
knew
that
we
be
fill
our
vial
with
enough
vaccine
volume
so
that
after
dilution
each
vial
would
have
approximately
ml
for
each
dose
we
need
ml
so
inside
every
vial
we
have
volume
for
at
least
six
dos
the
challenge
be
that
you
cannot
use
all
the
volume
all
the
time
after
injection
some
volume
will
remain
unused
typically
in
the
space
between
the
needle
and
the
tip
of
the
syringe
as
dead
volume
there
be
many
different
type
and
brand
of
syrinx
that
be
commercially
available
and
each
one
have
a
different
dead
volume
typically
the
issue
can
be
resolve
by
overfill
the
vial
to
cover
all
option
but
in
the
case
of
a
covid
vaccine
in
the
middle
of
a
pandemic
every
single
drop
save
could
mean
additional
life
save
to
be
accurate
each
dose
be
ml
so
with
any
excess
ml
per
vial
we
have
potential
to
save
an
additional
life
we
didn
t
have
the
luxury
of
waste
any
dos
we
discuss
this
issue
extensively
during
our
lightspeed
meeting
we
be
work
hard
to
build
incremental
capacity
so
the
fact
that
we
be
have
such
a
high
waste
be
clearly
not
feel
right
the
first
person
who
brought
this
to
my
attention
be
ugur
ahin
from
biontech
he
have
notice
that
we
be
significantly
overfill
our
vial
and
told
me
that
accord
to
his
calculation
we
be
waste
percent
albert
we
must
find
a
solution
to
this
ugur
told
me
i
brought
it
up
to
the
team
and
we
start
explore
solution
we
agree
to
a
plan
that
would
allow
us
to
test
many
different
combination
of
syrinx
and
needle
and
find
how
many
dos
could
be
extract
with
each
but
at
the
time
of
the
submission
we
hadn
t
do
the
work
to
determine
the
maximum
number
of
dos
that
we
could
safely
extract
from
each
vial
and
for
this
reason
we
file
our
application
indicate
only
five
dos
per
vial
follow
our
global
submission
our
vaccine
be
approve
in
many
country
of
the
world
as
five
dose
vial
but
in
the
meantime
we
continued
work
to
gather
the
evidence
for
high
dos
per
vial
it
felt
like
we
sample
every
syringe
and
needle
combination
in
the
world
in
december
and
january
our
country
manager
call
local
manufacturer
and
we
create
a
list
then
we
test
them
all
we
need
syringe
and
needle
match
that
would
extract
and
dispense
six
dos
consistently
we
discover
a
very
large
number
of
syringe
and
needle
combination
that
could
achieve
that
and
by
use
the
right
combination
of
low
dead
volume
syrinx
and
needle
we
discover
it
be
possible
to
reduce
the
waste
and
get
safely
at
least
percent
more
vaccine
out
of
each
vial
but
there
be
an
even
big
obstacle
to
overcome
there
simply
be
not
enough
of
the
necessary
syringe
and
needle
combination
to
serve
the
world
we
d
have
to
invent
that
supply
chain
as
well
it
become
a
new
parallel
work
stream
we
begin
by
activate
another
team
of
people
to
make
it
happen
initially
we
need
a
billion
syrinx
and
needle
fortunately
our
supplier
be
eager
to
help
we
share
our
production
plan
with
a
medical
tech
manufacturer
and
they
activate
their
facility
and
ramped
up
production
in
some
case
manufacturer
want
financial
guarantee
that
this
large
number
of
syrinx
and
needle
would
in
fact
be
purchase
by
provider
on
the
ground
we
told
these
manufacturer
to
go
for
maximum
production
without
worry
pfizer
would
buy
every
syringe
and
needle
they
couldn
t
sell
it
work
they
all
start
maximum
production
immediately
and
gradually
flood
the
market
with
this
type
of
needle
and
syrinx
we
then
have
to
get
the
regulatory
approval
for
the
change
once
the
data
support
six
dos
be
available
we
immediately
submit
it
to
regulatory
authority
around
the
world
the
six
dose
label
be
first
approve
by
israel
on
january
and
then
by
the
other
regulatory
agency
in
short
order
include
by
some
of
the
most
renowned
regulatory
agency
in
the
world
such
as
the
us
fda
the
european
medicine
agency
the
uk
medicine
and
healthcare
product
regulatory
agency
switzerland
and
the
world
health
organization
the
next
step
would
be
to
retrain
those
administer
the
vaccine
to
make
the
pivot
from
five
to
six
dos
per
vial
so
we
could
get
it
right
for
everyone
with
more
and
more
experience
some
country
be
now
see
up
to
seven
dos
per
vial
which
have
raise
the
overall
average
to
near
dos
per
vial
inside
pfizer
i
knew
that
colleague
would
feel
pride
about
what
we
have
accomplish
together
but
i
didn
t
fully
appreciate
how
great
that
pride
would
be
mike
mcdermott
s
five
daughter
drew
him
a
bright
cheerful
poster
that
say
thank
you
with
a
hashtag
for
his
division
pgsproud
one
group
open
an
online
company
store
offering
pfizer
t
shirt
and
other
item
with
our
logo
and
the
tagline
that
come
to
represent
our
commitment
to
science
science
will
win
so
many
employee
go
at
once
to
buy
item
for
their
family
that
they
crashed
the
website
our
chief
human
resource
officer
payal
sahni
becher
told
me
she
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
some
employee
get
a
pfizer
tattoo
i
would
not
be
among
them
although
i
have
to
admit
i
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
look
back
i
have
a
personal
scare
in
those
last
day
before
we
knew
the
effectiveness
of
the
vaccine
and
before
we
ramped
up
manufacturing
in
early
december
i
be
in
contact
with
two
people
who
later
test
positive
for
covid
they
visit
the
emergency
room
but
be
not
admit
we
learn
of
their
covid
infection
late
in
the
afternoon
on
december
the
same
night
we
be
expect
to
receive
news
of
the
vaccine
s
emergency
use
authorization
from
the
fda
the
irony
of
it
all
be
quite
dramatic
here
i
be
on
a
momentous
even
and
i
learn
that
i
have
be
directly
expose
my
team
suddenly
in
crisis
mode
move
quickly
to
find
a
way
to
have
me
test
in
three
day
i
be
schedule
to
do
an
in
person
interview
with
minute
at
our
pearl
river
site
and
it
be
important
that
i
not
inadvertently
expose
anyone
while
there
i
discuss
possible
option
with
yolanda
and
payal
i
could
visit
my
personal
physician
but
it
be
on
a
friday
afternoon
i
knew
there
be
no
way
he
be
available
we
also
discuss
the
possibility
of
me
go
to
a
local
test
center
but
my
team
do
not
like
that
option
at
all
at
that
time
the
line
at
local
drop
in
center
be
block
long
the
notion
of
me
the
ceo
of
pfizer
caught
on
video
wait
to
be
test
on
the
night
we
be
expect
to
hear
from
the
fda
about
our
vaccine
do
not
seem
like
a
very
good
idea
to
anyone
fortunately
we
come
up
with
an
alternative
plan
to
test
me
and
the
result
come
back
quickly
and
be
negative
i
have
not
contract
covid
by
mid
february
i
have
a
chance
to
celebrate
in
a
historic
way
the
accomplishment
of
research
manufacturing
and
first
line
worker
it
be
midwinter
when
i
receive
a
top
secret
phone
call
from
the
white
house
ask
if
president
biden
less
than
a
month
after
his
inauguration
could
join
me
for
a
tour
of
our
kalamazoo
manufacturing
site
which
be
actually
locate
in
the
small
town
of
portage
michigan
the
secret
service
ask
me
to
keep
it
quiet
but
i
ask
for
and
receive
approval
to
call
mike
mcdermott
mike
we
can
t
say
anything
about
this
to
anyone
but
president
biden
would
like
to
visit
our
plant
in
kalamazoo
next
week
how
should
we
do
this
we
will
tell
everyone
that
you
be
come
to
inspect
and
they
should
start
prepare
set
aside
the
secret
service
we
wouldn
t
do
that
much
more
to
prepare
for
the
president
it
felt
strange
hearing
this
i
remember
think
my
god
be
i
really
cause
that
much
disruption
when
i
visit
a
pfizer
site
now
i
understood
why
mike
have
refuse
to
have
me
visit
our
manufacturing
site
in
andover
at
the
begin
of
the
pandemic
by
tell
me
i
be
not
essential
the
tour
be
set
for
thursday
february
but
a
snowstorm
in
the
upper
midwest
threaten
to
suspend
the
presidential
visit
i
be
prepared
to
be
disappointed
but
the
white
house
call
again
to
ask
if
the
president
could
come
the
next
day
friday
instead
our
immediate
answer
of
course
when
the
motorcade
arrive
it
be
a
patriotic
moment
for
me
to
see
the
president
of
the
united
state
follow
closely
by
military
personnel
carry
the
football
with
the
nuclear
code
at
our
company
s
facility
he
congratulate
everyone
at
pfizer
and
together
we
make
our
way
from
machine
to
machine
where
worker
greet
us
and
explain
their
role
and
how
the
technology
work
it
be
amaze
to
see
the
president
s
personality
simply
and
easily
become
that
of
one
of
them
a
blue
collar
worker
he
be
obsess
with
their
story
and
their
job
he
be
clearly
in
his
element
we
be
run
late
to
address
worker
and
the
national
medium
when
he
pull
me
aside
place
both
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
look
me
in
the
eye
i
hear
your
parent
survive
the
holocaust
he
say
i
sense
his
staff
grow
anxious
for
us
to
proceed
onto
the
stage
he
ignore
them
he
begin
to
tell
me
about
other
family
he
have
know
who
still
bore
those
scar
the
world
grow
quiet
for
just
a
few
moment
and
i
could
feel
tear
in
my
eye
and
the
weight
of
his
embrace
on
my
shoulder
only
in
america

equity
easy
say
than
do
the
way
to
gain
a
good
reputation
be
to
endeavor
to
be
what
you
desire
to
appear
socrates
bc
when
we
d
start
the
covid
project
i
have
make
clear
that
return
on
investment
should
not
be
of
any
consideration
it
be
already
may
and
still
we
have
never
spoken
of
a
price
for
the
vaccine
or
calculate
revenue
stream
but
several
government
have
start
procurement
discussion
and
they
all
want
a
price
it
be
time
to
make
a
decision
the
way
we
price
our
medicine
be
by
calculate
the
value
they
bring
to
patient
to
the
healthcare
system
and
to
society
unlike
what
some
may
believe
good
medicine
reduce
rather
than
increase
the
cost
of
a
healthcare
system
we
try
to
calculate
this
economic
value
for
example
if
one
hundred
people
take
a
heart
medicine
and
as
a
result
we
have
five
few
heart
attack
we
calculate
the
cost
that
these
five
heart
attack
would
generate
to
the
healthcare
system
ambulance
ride
hospital
stay
test
doctor
caregiver
work
day
lose
etc
and
compare
it
to
the
cost
of
the
medicine
for
one
hundred
people
of
course
there
be
many
more
nuance
to
this
economic
value
how
do
one
put
a
price
on
the
avoidance
of
human
pain
this
in
my
opinion
be
truly
invaluable
i
ask
our
pricing
team
to
calculate
the
usual
economics
of
the
global
covid
crisis
and
they
come
back
with
stagger
number
for
an
assume
percent
efficacy
the
reduction
of
hospitalization
cost
alone
would
be
hundred
of
billion
of
dollar
we
could
price
the
vaccine
at
per
dose
and
still
the
healthcare
system
would
pay
less
than
it
save
not
counting
the
value
of
human
life
save
i
realize
that
this
could
become
a
gigantic
financial
opportunity
for
us
but
also
that
in
the
middle
of
a
pandemic
we
could
not
use
the
standard
value
calculation
for
set
the
price
i
ask
for
a
different
approach
i
told
the
team
to
bring
me
the
current
cost
of
other
cut
edge
vaccine
like
for
measles
shingle
pneumonia
etc
in
the
us
they
be
price
between
and
per
dose
it
sound
fair
to
me
to
match
the
low
end
of
the
already
exist
vaccine
price
no
one
could
say
that
we
be
use
the
pandemic
as
an
opportunity
to
set
price
at
unusually
high
level
i
told
my
team
to
begin
procurement
discussion
at
this
start
point
and
offer
discount
for
volume
commitment
the
uk
and
us
government
as
well
as
the
european
union
have
already
approach
us
for
procurement
negotiation
and
we
have
start
preliminary
discussion
with
them
but
soon
thereafter
and
while
these
discussion
be
ongoing
a
level
of
discomfort
start
gnawing
at
me
i
be
think
that
we
might
be
miss
an
opportunity
to
gain
something
more
valuable
than
a
fair
financial
return
we
have
a
chance
to
gain
back
our
industry
s
reputation
which
have
be
under
fire
for
the
last
two
decade
in
the
us
pharmaceutical
ranked
near
the
bottom
of
all
sector
right
next
to
the
government
in
term
of
reputation
i
again
ask
the
pricing
team
to
give
me
the
current
price
of
the
cheapest
commodity
vaccine
in
the
us
flu
vaccine
cost
up
to
but
they
also
offer
a
low
protection
rate
of
around
percent
their
low
end
be
around
to
we
be
change
course
i
told
them
for
the
high
income
country
the
start
point
should
be
the
low
end
of
flu
pricing
we
can
still
offer
discount
for
high
volume
commitment
but
this
be
the
cost
of
a
simple
meal
not
a
cut
edge
vaccine
someone
reply
from
the
pricing
team
the
cost
of
a
simple
meal
i
like
this
expression
very
much
later
i
would
use
it
often
when
ask
by
journalist
about
pricing
i
turn
to
the
colleague
who
have
told
me
this
and
reply
i
like
that
you
could
make
a
great
career
in
marketing
we
go
back
to
the
us
and
european
negotiator
and
reduce
our
price
significantly
they
be
very
positively
surprised
but
the
vaccine
have
to
be
accessible
to
everyone
everywhere
in
an
equitable
way
equity
doesn
t
mean
that
we
give
everyone
the
same
equity
mean
that
we
give
more
to
those
who
need
more
therefore
we
couldn
t
have
a
single
price
for
all
instead
we
decide
to
implement
a
three
tiered
pricing
approach
we
use
the
world
bank
s
classification
of
economy
for
our
own
analytical
purpose
the
world
bank
us
gross
national
income
gni
per
caput
data
in
us
dollar
convert
from
local
currency
use
the
world
bank
atlas
method
which
be
apply
to
smooth
exchange
rate
fluctuation
to
classify
country
into
four
category
high
income
country
upper
middle
income
country
low
middle
income
country
and
low
income
country
we
have
just
agree
that
the
price
for
the
wealthier
nation
the
high
income
country
would
be
the
cost
of
a
simple
meal
the
upper
middle
income
country
would
be
offer
vaccine
at
approximately
half
of
this
price
and
the
low
middle
income
and
low
income
country
would
receive
the
vaccine
at
a
not
for
profit
price
the
only
stipulation
be
that
the
country
make
the
vaccine
free
to
their
citizen
in
pandemic
you
be
only
as
protect
as
your
neighbor
and
it
be
extremely
important
that
we
not
let
price
be
an
obstacle
to
anyone
not
only
because
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
but
also
because
it
will
be
a
threat
not
only
to
these
country
but
to
all
i
say
the
team
be
very
happy
with
the
clarity
and
equity
we
be
bring
to
our
approach
the
next
day
they
prepared
pricing
guideline
that
be
sent
to
all
our
local
operation
in
every
country
with
the
instruction
to
approach
their
local
government
and
ask
for
advanced
purchase
order
under
these
condition
angela
hwang
pfizer

for
the
biopharmaceuticals
group
lead
that
effort
with
her
talented
team
in
region
around
the
world
a
dynamic
leader
with
a
long
career
at
pfizer
angela
s
childhood
experience
be
that
of
an
asian
girl
grow
up
in
apartheid
era
south
africa
this
define
her
worldview
and
underscored
the
importance
of
equity
angela
and
her
team
set
out
to
sign
up
every
country
to
order
the
vaccine
for
its
citizen
in
one
of
the
three
pricing
tier
but
they
also
help
the
country
s
frontline
worker
to
be
prepared
the
education
effort
be
enormous
in
the
united
state
alone
they
work
with
the
state
and
operation
warp
speed
to
train
forty
thousand
people
to
handle
and
administer
the
vaccine
once
a
country
have
the
vaccine
it
have
to
know
how
to
store
and
dilute
it
and
monitor
patient
for
side
effect
afterward
most
of
the
high
income
country
be
among
the
first
to
place
order
to
reserve
dos
of
our
vaccine
through
europe
the
us
japan
and
the
uk
be
among
the
many
that
include
us
in
their
bet
unfortunately
many
other
country
particularly
middle
and
low
income
decide
to
go
exclusively
with
other
vaccine
either
because
mrna
technology
be
untested
at
that
time
or
because
other
company
have
promise
local
manufacturing
option
our
local
team
try
hard
but
be
unsuccessful
in
change
leader
mind
as
i
look
at
my
excel
spreadsheet
the
disproportionate
allocation
of
dos
to
high
income
country
become
a
concern
situation
i
make
a
personal
effort
to
convince
some
of
the
middle
and
low
income
country
that
have
not
place
order
i
sent
letter
to
their
leader
and
our
local
team
follow
up
but
we
be
again
mostly
unsuccessful
in
october
even
after
it
have
become
clear
that
pfizer
would
be
the
front
runner
in
quickly
bring
a
vaccine
to
patient
a
few
additional
country
have
add
their
name
to
the
list
of
nation
order
our
vaccine
but
still
not
enough
low
and
middle
income
country
to
balance
inequity
the
situation
start
to
change
as
soon
as
the
vaccine
be
pronounce
effective
first
the
us
government
which
have
order
one
hundred
million
dos
approach
us
and
ask
to
order
an
additional
one
hundred
million
a
few
month
back
we
have
ask
ows
to
order
these
additional
one
hundred
million
dos
because
our
supply
be
about
to
sell
out
they
refuse
i
personally
call
the
ows
leadership
and
told
them
that
europe
have
order
two
hundred
million
dos
and
it
would
be
prudent
for
them
to
do
the
same
i
remember
say
it
would
be
embarrass
for
the
us
to
not
be
able
to
get
dos
from
an
american
company
just
because
they
didn
t
order
enough
and
emphasize
that
we
intend
to
stick
to
the
principle
of
allocate
our
production
strictly
to
confirm
order
respect
our
commitment
this
be
to
say
that
if
they
change
their
mind
later
we
be
not
prepared
to
take
dos
away
from
other
country
that
already
have
place
order
ows
have
refuse
again
at
that
time
now
they
want
the
additional
one
hundred
million
dos
and
they
want
them
immediately
the
problem
be
that
all
our
project
supply
for
the
first
six
month
have
already
be
allocate
to
other
country
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
deliver
additional
dos
before
june
but
we
could
deliver
later
in
the
year
however
the
discussion
be
stall
because
of
other
reason
that
s
when
president
trump
s
son
in
law
and
advisor
jared
kushner
call
me
to
resolve
the
issue
we
d
thought
that
provide
the
us
with
an
additional
one
hundred
million
dos
would
be
straightforward
our
exist
contract
give
them
the
opportunity
to
purchase
additional
dos
but
bureaucracy
be
get
in
the
way
because
the
vaccine
be
now
approve
they
couldn
t
or
didn
t
want
to
use
the
original
contract
under
which
they
have
purchase
the
vaccine
when
it
be
a
candidate
for
approval
i
didn
t
want
to
reopen
negotiation
i
felt
it
would
be
a
pandora
s
box
because
we
have
spent
week
negotiate
the
first
contract
in
the
meantime
criticism
of
the
trump
administration
for
not
have
purchase
enough
dos
be
mount
jared
call
to
understand
what
the
issue
be
i
explain
the
situation
with
the
request
to
start
negotiation
again
with
new
language
in
the
contract
jared
indicate
that
he
thought
the
bureaucracy
be
ridiculous
and
promise
to
call
the
right
people
jared
s
intervention
help
us
reach
a
resolution
and
a
few
day
and
several
phone
call
later
our
lawyer
have
come
to
a
mutually
agree
upon
solution
but
then
the
issue
of
the
delivery
schedule
come
up
again
jared
be
ask
for
a
very
aggressive
delivery
plan
to
the
us
for
the
additional
one
hundred
million
dos
he
want
it
all
in
the
second
quarter
of
to
do
that
we
would
have
have
to
take
supply
from
canada
japan
and
latin
american
country
all
of
which
have
place
their
order
earlier
than
the
us
and
be
expect
the
vaccine
in
the
second
quarter
i
refuse
to
do
that
and
the
debate
between
the
two
of
us
become
heat
i
remind
jared
that
i
have
make
very
clear
to
moncef
slaoui
that
we
would
not
take
dos
from
other
country
to
give
to
the
us
and
that
i
have
almost
beg
ows
to
increase
their
order
quantity
in
the
first
contract
but
that
they
have
repeatedly
refuse
to
do
so
but
jared
didn
t
budge
in
his
mind
america
be
come
first
no
matter
what
in
my
mind
fairness
have
to
come
first
he
insist
that
the
us
should
take
its
additional
one
hundred
million
dos
before
we
sent
dos
to
anyone
else
from
our
kalamazoo
plant
he
remind
me
that
he
represent
the
government
and
they
could
take
measure
to
enforce
their
will
be
my
guest
jared
i
reply
i
prefer
to
have
japan
s
prime
minister
complain
to
you
about
the
cancellation
of
the
olympics
rather
than
to
me
thankfully
our
manufacturing
team
continued
to
work
miracle
and
i
receive
an
improve
manufacturing
schedule
that
would
allow
us
to
provide
the
additional
dos
to
the
us
from
april
to
july
without
cut
the
supply
to
the
other
country
it
be
a
good
compromise
and
eventually
the
contract
be
sign
jared
call
me
two
day
later
from
mar
a
lago
to
thank
me
for
the
collaboration
and
we
close
the
loop
on
a
happy
note
a
month
later
the
same
scenario
be
repeat
with
the
eu
the
european
commission
have
start
get
a
lot
of
pressure
from
member
state
to
implement
an
export
ban
for
vaccine
manufacture
on
european
soil
astrazeneca
fail
to
supply
and
this
create
a
political
problem
for
european
leader
who
have
place
significant
bet
on
them
the
european
start
implement
an
export
control
system
that
require
us
to
submit
a
lot
of
information
before
we
could
export
any
dos
outside
the
eu
although
the
system
be
not
an
export
ban
it
become
a
significant
administrative
burden
for
our
belgian
manufacturing
site
the
complaint
kept
come
my
way
do
something
about
it
bos
the
people
who
be
work
to
send
the
vaccine
to
so
many
country
be
the
same
people
push
this
additional
paperwork
they
be
exhaust
and
we
can
t
train
others
on
the
fly
i
call
ursula
von
der
leyen
president
of
the
european
commission
to
ask
her
to
relax
these
requirement
my
pitch
be
that
as
long
as
we
met
the
delivery
schedule
we
should
be
unburdened
from
this
obligation
ursula
insist
on
keep
the
control
in
place
and
she
point
out
that
half
of
our
output
from
european
manufacturing
site
be
allow
to
be
export
outside
the
eu
while
none
of
the
us
produce
output
be
export
outside
the
us
i
knew
she
be
right
and
acknowledge
it
under
the
defense
procurement
act
dpa
which
be
incorporate
into
our
agreement
with
the
us
government
we
risk
not
only
civil
but
also
criminal
prosecution
if
we
export
the
vaccine
outside
the
united
state
so
while
the
us
government
do
not
ban
export
of
the
vaccine
per
se
the
repercussion
for
us
do
so
could
have
be
dire
under
the
strict
guideline
of
the
dpa
i
ask
if
president
von
der
leyen
be
familiar
with
these
detail
i
ask
her
to
at
least
reduce
the
amount
of
the
request
information
that
we
have
to
submit
every
time
we
be
send
a
shipment
to
a
country
she
promise
to
have
a
look
into
it
i
knew
she
would
because
she
be
someone
who
always
kept
her
word
i
get
to
know
president
von
der
leyen
well
through
our
discussion
during
the
covid
crisis
we
first
spoke
on
the
phone
on
january
regard
dose

a
remarkable
woman
born
in
brussels

grow
up
in

to

and
go
on
to
serve
in
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
cabinet
include
as
defense
minister
over
the
come

would
build
a
close
relationship
with

text
and
phone
call
about
the
vaccine

variant
and
manufacturing
she
be
knowledgeable
about
all
these
topic
and
never
miss
an
opportunity
to

for
an
accelerate

and
she
have
a
remarkable

everyone
everywhere
i
be
prepare
to
become
ceo
when
i
heard
his
proclamation
and
i
remember
think
this
be
exactly
what
my
vision
for
pfizer
be
and
i
couldn
t
have
say
it
well
my
team
warn
me
that
work
with
the
who
have
be
tough
in
the
past
but
i
saw
dr
tedros
s
mission
and
our
value
as
very
much
align
in
august
in
the
middle
of
the
pandemic
and
with
a
potential
business
trip
to
europe
approach
i
ask
my
team
to
request
a
meeting
with
him
i
be
told
that
tedros
would
not
likely
accept
a
meeting
with
a
biopharmaceutical
company
s
ceo
he
prefer
to
work
through
industry
association
i
be
seriously
disappointed
by
this
news
what
a
waste
opportunity
to
do
something
together
for
the
world
how
could
we
let
prejudice
or
preconceive
notion
stand
in
the
way
of
us
talk
and
suddenly
on
the
morning
of
sunday
december
i
receive
a
whatsapp
text
that
say
dear
albert
i
hope
all
be
well
this
be
tedros
from
the
who
i
would
appreciate
it
if
i
can
have
a
few
minute
of
your
time
to
discus
covid
please
let
me
know
the
opening
you
have
and
i
will
arrange
my
best
tedros
know
what
my
team
have
told
me
i
be
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
this
text
i
reply
immediately
and
we
spoke
the
next
day
the
first
thing
i
told
him
be
how
happy
i
be
that
he
reach
out
that
the
who
be
critical
and
that
i
be
very
disappointed
when
president
trump
withdrew
the
us
from
the
who
i
told
him
i
be
look
forward
to
work
together
to
find
solution
and
ensure
equitable
access
to
vaccine
and
treatment
the
discussion
go
very
well
and
i
felt
that
tedros
be
deeply
commit
to
the
most
vulnerable
because
i
felt
such
a
connection
to
him
i
couldn
t
help
myself
and
in
the
end
told
him
my
frustration
about
have
want
to
have
this
discussion
four
month
earlier
when
i
visit
geneva
but
have
be
told
that
he
wouldn
t
take
a
meeting
with
a
pharma
ceo
what
be
you
talk
about
he
reply
my
office
be
open
for
everyone
who
want
to
see
me
i
believe
him
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
it
be
our
own
preconceive
notion
that
have
prevent
that
meeting
in
august
from
happen
this
first
exchange
would
set
the
stage
for
a
productive
and
very
warm
relationship
not
only
do
we
remain
in
touch
over
whatsapp
but
our
staff
do
as
well
his
team
support
us
to
get
an
agreement
with
covax
so
when
pfizer
become
the
first
company
to
launch
a
covid
vaccine
our
mutual
desire
for
everyone
on
the
planet
to
get
the
vaccine
lead
to
tremendous
collaboration
and
the
first
fruit
of
this
partnership
eventually
come
together
but
it
be
not
easy
i
told
covax
leadership
that
pfizer
be
offering
the
vaccine
at
cost
for
low
income
country
yet
they
continued
to
focus
on
the
price
for
wealthier
and
middle
income
country
from
what
i
could
tell
their
allocation
methodology
do
not
prioritize
low
resourced
country
it
appear
that
they
want
to
create
a
global
vaccine
hub
situate
the
who
at
the
center
of
that
hub
but
this
be
a
design
flaw
rich
nation
could
come
directly
to
the
vaccine
manufacturer
and
negotiate
it
be
a
matter
of
national
security
for
those
country
but
the
poor
country
need
covax
the
aspiration
of
covax
do
not
meet
with
the
reality
of
how
access
would
unfold
for
the
world
i
believe
that
by
focus
on
all
country
covax
miss
the
point
that
equity
doesn
t
mean
do
the
same
for
all
but
rather
mean
do
more
for
those
who
need
more
and
who
really
need
their
support
be
the
low
income
country
in
january
pfizer
and
biontech
sign
an
advanced
purchase
agreement
with
covax
for
up
to
forty
million
dos
of
our
covid
vaccine
in
frankly
i
be
surprised
when
covax
sought
only
forty
million
dos
clearly
not
enough
to
meet
their
ambitious
goal
i
ask
be
you
sure
how
will
you
meet
the
projection
you
ve
set
i
be
told
covax
have
decide
to
work
with
astrazeneca
as
the
backbone
of
their
strategy
they
use
gate
foundation
funding
to
build
a
technology
transfer
scheme
with
the
serum
institute
of
india
a
large
vaccine
manufacturer
but
that
plan
didn
t
work
well
south
africa
drop
astrazeneca
because
its
vaccine
do
not
block
the
south
african
mutation
and
astrazeneca
couldn
t
manufacture
the
volume
they
have
promise
to
compound
problem
in
may
many
nation
begin
to
seal
their
border
to
india
as
the
virus
spread
there
in
spring
as
most
region
in
the
world
be
see
a
welcome
downturn
in
covid
case
south
asia
driven
by
india
begin
what
the
economist
call
a
himalayan
ascent
on
april
the
daily
covid
count
pass
four
hundred
thousand
nearly
one
quarter
of
the
population
have
test
positive
death
be
rise
and
a
public
health
crisis
in
one
of
the
world
s
most
populous
nation
meant
a
health
crisis
everywhere
our
vaccine
be
not
approve
in
india
despite
the
fact
that
in
august
we
have
submit
the
same
application
to
indian
regulator
that
we
have
submit
to
all
other
country
in
the
world
india
be
very
protective
of
its
generic
drug
industry
and
make
the
registration
of
vaccine
that
be
manufacture
outside
india
very
difficult
we
start
discussion
with
the
indian
government
to
see
how
we
could
help
by
provide
other
medicine
that
could
be
use
by
their
public
hospital
on
the
eve
of
pfizer
s
first
quarterly
earnings
report
as
the
death
toll
in
india
be
mount
i
sent
a
memo
to
our
colleague
in
india
promising
that
we
would
donate
to
india
the
pfizer
medicine
that
the
government
of
india
have
identify
as
part
of
its
covid
treatment
protocol
we
pledge
to
donate
enough
to
ensure
that
every
covid
patient
in
every
public
hospital
across
the
country
could
have
access
to
the
pfizer
medicine
they
need
in
the
next
ninety
day
free
of
charge
i
conclude
that
pfizer
would
stand
in
solidarity
with
all
those
currently
affected
by
covid
in
india
and
around
the
world
and
would
continue
to
do
everything
possible
to
help
as
we
work
to
meet
the
public
health
need
and
to
be
a
partner
with
the
government
of
india
to
establish
a
path
forward
for
our
vaccine
please
know
you
and
your
love
one
be
foremost
in
our
thought
and
prayer
i
write
in
a
letter
to
our
indian
colleague
on
may
as
the
situation
in
india
be
deteriorate
the
country
decide
to
ban
all
export
of
the
astrazeneca
covid
vaccine
that
be
produce
locally
by
the
serum
institute
unfortunately
covax
have
base
most
of
their
planning
on
this
vaccine
this
plan
be
now
collapse
so
covax
return
to
us
and
ask
for
significantly
more
dos
we
agree
but
with
one
condition
that
all
our
dos
go
to
covax
s
advance
market
commitment
country
the
ninety
two
low
income
country
and
economy
in
the
world
this
become
a
stick
point
again
because
covax
continued
its
desire
to
serve
all
its
member
they
wouldn
t
agree
to
take
dos
for
the
poor
country
only
they
want
to
distribute
the
dos
we
be
go
to
give
them
to
all
their
country
rich
and
poor
base
on
a
formula
they
have
agree
to
this
be
not
acceptable
to
us
nevertheless
we
resume
discussion
with
a
mutual
desire
to
get
vaccine
where
they
be
need
most
in
the
meantime
the
us
trade
representative
katherine
tai
announce
suddenly
that
the
us
would
support
a
waiver
of
the
trade
related
aspect
of
intellectual
property
right
trip
agreement
for
covid
vaccine
at
the
world
trade
organization
wto
the
trip
agreement
be
an
international
legal
agreement
that
be
sign
in
april
of
and
become
effective
on
january
the
agreement
introduce
intellectual
property
law
into
the
multilateral
trading
system
for
the
first
time
india
and
south
africa
have
request
such
a
waiver
from
the
wto
but
there
be
no
traction
for
this
request
so
far
interestingly
enough
both
country
be
among
the
large
generic
medicine
manufacturer
in
the
world
and
for
many
people
the
request
look
quite
self
serve
one
week
before
the
trip
waiver
announcement
ambassador
tai
have
request
a
call
with
me
to
discus
the
global
supply
of
the
covid
vaccine
i
have
the
opportunity
to
explain
to
her
that
in
the
last
few
month
we
have
invest
more
than
billion
for
the
covid
vaccine
of
which
more
than
billion
go
to
manufacturing
infrastructure
as
a
result
we
expect
to
manufacture
by
the
end
of
three
billion
dos
of
covid
vaccine
of
which
at
least
one
billion
dos
would
go
to
middle
and
low
income
country
i
also
remind
her
that
we
have
a
tiered
pricing
model
and
that
the
low
middle
income
and
low
income
country
of
the
world
would
receive
it
at
cost
i
explain
that
intellectual
property
be
not
an
obstacle
to
produce
more
and
that
the
reason
we
cannot
manufacture
even
more
dos
faster
be
not
the
lack
of
enough
manufacturing
infrastructure
but
the
lack
of
enough
raw
material
waive
intellectual
property
protection
could
only
disrupt
the
supply
chain
and
make
it
dangerous
for
all
i
also
remind
her
that
a
good
way
to
increase
the
quantity
that
go
to
the
poorer
country
would
be
for
the
us
government
to
allow
us
to
export
dos
produce
under
dpa
to
latin
america
and
africa
because
right
now
they
do
not
and
we
be
export
to
these
country
only
from
our
manufacturing
site
in
europe
i
repeat
this
specific
request
a
few
time
but
she
didn
t
respond
to
it
the
call
be
generally
very
polite
but
when
we
disconnect
i
do
not
have
a
very
good
feel
during
this
pandemic
i
d
have
plenty
of
discussion
with
governmental
official
and
not
all
of
them
be
pleasant
however
this
be
the
first
time
i
felt
that
the
person
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
or
in
this
case
the
computer
screen
be
not
really
interested
in
understand
the
information
i
be
provide
it
be
as
if
she
have
already
make
up
her
mind
and
the
call
be
make
to
check
a
box
that
say
we
d
have
this
discussion
nevertheless
i
never
expect
that
one
week
later
she
would
announce
the
us
support
for
india
and
south
africa
s
proposal
when
on
the
morning
of
may
i
read
the
statement
of
ambassador
tai
that
the
us
would
support
the
trip
waiver
which
would
undercut
intellectual
property
protection
i
be
frankly
piss
i
be
truly
angry
that
at
the
same
time
that
the
us
government
be
block
us
from
export
covid
dos
to
other
country
their
trade
representative
be
support
a
proposal
that
would
directly
harm
the
intellectual
property
right
of
an
american
company
the
us
trade
representative
be
there
to
support
the
interest
of
the
us
industry
instead
i
felt
the
government
have
just
thrown
us
under
the
bus
i
go
so
far
as
to
text
one
of
my
white
house
contact
that
i
felt
betrayed
two
day
later
on
may
i
release
a
letter
to
pfizer
colleague
explain
the
situation
with
the
global
supply
the
letter
be
my
attempt
to
tell
thing
the
way
they
be
without
sugarcoat
anything
dear
colleague
the
recent
announcement
that
the
united
state
trade
representative
will
discus
option
to
waive
some
covid
vaccine
intellectual
property
ip
right
have
create
some
confusion
to
the
world
have
pfizer
do
enough
to
ensure
fair
and
equitable
distribution
of
our
covid
vaccine
be
the
propose
waiver
go
to
bring
solution
or
create
more
problem
i
be
write
to
you
today
to
discus
these
question
fair
and
equitable
distribution
be
our
north
star
from
day
one
in
order
to
ensure
that
every
country
can
have
access
to
our
covid
vaccine
two
condition
have
to
be
met
a
price
that
anyone
can
afford
and
reliable
manufacturing
of
enough
vaccine
for
all
the
first
condition
be
met
in
the
early
day
back
in
june
of
we
decide
to
offer
our
vaccine
through
tiered
pricing
the
wealthier
nation
would
have
to
pay
in
the
range
of
about
the
cost
of
a
takeaway
meal
and
would
offer
it
to
their
citizen
for
free
the
middle
income
country
be
offer
dos
at
roughly
half
that
price
and
the
low
income
country
be
offer
dos
at
cost
many
of
the
poorest
community
will
receive
their
dos
through
donation
equity
doesn
t
mean
we
give
everyone
the
same
equity
mean
we
give
more
to
those
that
need
more
meeting
the
second
condition
be
much
more
challenge
but
we
be
get
there
with
remarkable
speed
thanks
to
the
ingenuity
and
hard
work
of
our
scientist
engineer
and
skilled
worker
and
multibillion
dollar
of
pfizer
investment
we
announce
that
we
will
provide
to
the
world
more
than
billion
dos
in
in
fact
our
internal
target
be
billion
dos
so
we
feel
quite
comfortable
about
our
commitment
achieve
billion
dos
this
year
mean
by
extrapolation
billion
dos
in
these
dos
be
not
for
the
rich
or
poor
not
for
the
north
or
south
these
be
dos
for
all
we
have
conclude
agreement
to
supply
country
and
we
be
currently
in
advanced
negotiation
with
many
more
for
a
total
of
approximately
billion
dos
in
upon
finalization
of
all
agreement
we
expect
that
of
them
or
more
than
billion
dos
will
go
to
middle
and
low
income
country
in
this
clearly
pose
another
question
until
today
we
have
ship
approximately
million
dos
and
the
balance
be
more
favorable
to
high
income
country
why
be
that
when
we
developed
our
tiered
pricing
policy
we
reach
out
to
all
nation
ask
them
to
place
order
so
we
could
allocate
dos
for
them
in
reality
the
high
income
country
reserve
most
of
the
dos
i
become
personally
concerned
with
that
and
i
reach
out
to
many
head
of
middle
low
income
country
by
letter
phone
and
even
text
to
urge
them
to
reserve
dos
because
the
supply
be
limited
however
most
of
them
decide
to
place
order
with
other
vaccine
maker
either
because
mrna
technology
be
untested
at
that
time
or
because
they
be
offer
local
production
option
some
didn
t
even
approve
our
vaccine
unfortunately
other
vaccine
producer
be
not
able
to
meet
their
supply
commitment
for
vary
technical
reason
most
of
the
country
that
do
not
choose
us
initially
come
back
and
thanks
to
our
phenomenal
supply
ramp
up
we
have
start
signing
supply
agreement
with
them
we
expect
the
supply
balance
to
weigh
in
their
favor
in
the
second
half
of
and
to
have
virtually
enough
supply
for
all
in
last
week
i
have
the
opportunity
to
provide
these
fact
to
the
us
trade
representative
and
explain
why
the
suggest
waiver
of
ip
right
could
only
derail
this
progress
which
brings
me
to
the
second
question
be
the
propose
waiver
go
to
improve
the
supply
situation
or
create
more
problem
and
my
answer
be
categorically
the
latter
when
we
create
our
vaccine
there
be
no
manufacturing
production
of
any
mrna
vaccine
or
medicine
anywhere
in
the
world
we
have
to
create
manufacturing
infrastructure
from
scratch
with
year
of
quality
manufacturing
tradition
substantial
deployment
of
capital
and
more
importantly
an
army
of
highly
skilled
scientist
engineer
and
manufacturing
worker
we
developed
in
record
time
the
most
efficient
manufacturing
machine
of
a
life
save
vaccine
that
the
world
have
ever
see
currently
infrastructure
be
not
the
bottleneck
for
us
manufacturing
faster
the
restriction
be
the
scarcity
of
highly
specialized
raw
material
need
to
produce
our
vaccine
these
different
material
or
component
be
produce
by
many
supplier
in
different
country
many
of
them
need
our
substantial
support
technical
and
financial
to
ramp
up
their
production
right
now
virtually
every
single
gram
of
raw
material
produce
be
ship
immediately
into
our
manufacturing
facility
and
be
convert
immediately
and
reliably
to
vaccine
that
be
ship
immediately
around
the
world
country
to
date
the
propose
waiver
for
covid
vaccine
threatens
to
disrupt
the
flow
of
raw
material
it
will
unleash
a
scramble
for
the
critical
input
we
require
in
order
to
make
a
safe
and
effective
vaccine
entity
with
little
or
no
experience
in
manufacturing
vaccine
be
likely
to
chase
the
very
raw
material
we
require
to
scale
our
production
put
the
safety
and
security
of
all
at
risk
and
i
would
like
to
make
a
final
point
i
worry
that
waive
of
patent
protection
will
disincentivize
anyone
else
from
take
a
big
risk
we
deployed
billion
before
we
knew
whether
we
could
successfully
develop
a
vaccine
because
we
understood
what
be
at
stake
just
recently
i
authorize
spending
an
additional
million
on
covid
research
and
development
that
will
bring
our
total
spend
for
r
d
in
to
more
than
billion
the
recent
rhetoric
will
not
discourage
us
from
continue
invest
in
science
but
i
be
not
sure
if
the
same
be
true
for
the
thousand
of
small
biotech
innovator
that
be
totally
dependent
on
access
capital
from
investor
who
invest
only
on
the
premise
that
their
intellectual
property
will
be
protect
end
the
pandemic
and
vaccinate
the
world
be
a
massive
but
achievable
undertaking
we
remain
fully
focus
on
get
high
quality
safe
and
effective
vaccine
to
patient
all
over
the
world
as
quickly
as
possible
and
to
put
an
end
to
this
deadly
pandemic
once
again
we
will
not
let
politics
stand
in
our
way
and
we
will
continue
do
what
we
do
best
create
breakthrough
that
change
patient
life
soon
after
the
announcement
of
this
decision
i
realize
that
i
be
not
the
only
one
who
be
shock
by
it
i
start
have
call
with
the
president
and
prime
minister
of
many
country
and
they
be
all
tell
me
how
surprised
they
be
by
this
proposal
off
the
record
they
be
all
tell
me
that
this
proposal
do
not
make
any
sense
many
go
the
extra
step
to
tell
me
that
in
their
view
without
intellectual
property
protection
the
world
wouldn
t
have
a
covid
vaccine
right
now
some
ask
me
if
i
have
any
idea
what
the
motivation
for
such
a
decision
be
i
told
them
that
in
my
opinion
they
didn
t
expect
this
waiver
to
go
anywhere
and
they
just
want
to
give
something
toothless
to
the
progressive
wing
of
the
party
that
be
against
the
pharmaceutical
industry
i
still
remember
the
response
of
an
eu
country
leader
but
it
s
so
irresponsible
one
of
the
leader
i
spoke
with
be
president
ursula
von
der
leyen
during
this
call
i
told
her
that
at
least
one
billion
vaccine
dos
be
earmark
for
middle
and
low
income
country
in
she
be
a
bit
surprised
to
learn
that
we
expect
to
provide
the
dos
this
year
and
question
whether
this
be
widely
know
to
help
spread
the
word
she
invite
me
to
speak
at
a
global
health
conference
in
rome
of
course
she
also
let
me
know
how
nice
it
would
be
if
pfizer
could
make
the
commitment
not
only
for
but
also
for
i
accepted
immediately
in
late
may
i
participate
virtually
in
the
global
health
summit
in
rome
and
share
that
pfizer
expect
to
provide
one
billion
dos
of
our
vaccine
to
low
and
middle
income
country
in
and
we
pledge
to
deliver
an
additional
one
billion
dos
to
these
country
in
it
be
our
hope
that
this
will
accelerate
our
ability
to
help
save
even
more
life
across
the
globe
end
the
pandemic
and
vaccinate
the
world
be
a
massive
but
achievable
undertaking
i
say
in
my
brief
remark
in
the
week
that
follow
i
calm
down
rethought
thing
despite
my
disappointment
with
the
us
trade
representative
s
decision
have
shadow
over
our
relation
with
the
administration
be
not
a
good
feel
and
more
important
i
believe
there
be
many
meaningful
thing
we
could
accomplish
together
i
wouldn
t
let
my
anger
or
emotion
get
the
well
of
me
i
felt
the
best
way
to
forge
tie
with
this
white
house
be
to
show
our
true
character
and
propose
solution
to
the
enormous
health
challenge
that
covid
be
still
pose
the
us
be
feel
the
heat
for
not
allow
export
of
american
produce
dos
or
have
a
plan
to
share
the
vaccine
wealth
with
the
less
fortunate
i
knew
we
could
help
as
part
of
my
desire
to
move
on
i
arrange
a
call
with
the
white
house
covid
response
coordinator
jeff
zients
i
have
spoken
to
jeff
many
time
previously
for
issue
related
to
the
us
government
response
to
the
covid
crisis
since
january
when
he
take
over
his
role
as
a
member
of
the
biden
administration
he
have
lead
the
us
response
very
successfully
i
respect
him
as
someone
equally
at
home
in
government
and
business
someone
i
have
confidence
in
and
with
whom
we
could
work
however
since
the
incident
with
the
trip
waiver
announcement
i
have
not
call
him
apparently
jeff
have
heard
about
my
ire
and
he
hadn
t
call
me
either
the
call
begin
a
bit
tentatively
then
to
my
surprise
jeff
shift
gear
and
say
first
that
we
should
move
forward
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
be
to
find
something
big
that
we
could
do
together
i
grabbed
the
opportunity
and
offer
jeff
an
idea
how
about
if
we
work
together
and
we
produce
hundred
of
million
of
dos
and
make
them
available
to
the
united
state
government
at
cost
then
the
us
government
can
donate
them
very
quickly
to
the
needy
country
jeff
like
the
idea
and
we
start
brainstorming
about
it
we
discuss
which
country
we
could
give
the
dos
to
and
agree
that
the
ninety
two
country
of
gavi
and
the
country
of
the
african
union
could
become
an
excellent
recipient
pool
then
we
discuss
the
logistical
challenge
of
the
us
government
send
dos
to
so
many
country
and
i
promise
that
we
would
take
care
of
it
and
ensure
the
complex
logistics
in
get
these
vaccine
to
country
with
limited
infrastructure
the
idea
be
shape
into
something
big
a
biden
vaccine
marshall
plan
jeff
do
not
hesitate
he
be
enthusiastic
and
eager
to
take
this
proposal
to
the
president
we
go
to
work
start
legal
and
logistical
discussion
the
us
government
want
to
use
the
covax
facility
as
a
main
mechanism
for
distribute
the
dos
but
we
be
insistent
that
if
the
dos
be
donate
by
the
us
government
to
the
covax
facility
the
dos
must
only
be
make
available
to
the
ninety
two
advance
market
commitment
country
and
the
african
union
where
the
need
be
great
the
us
make
this
a
condition
to
covax
and
decide
to
purchase
five
hundred
million
dos
with
an
option
to
procure
more
it
be
a
major
step
toward
vaccine
equity
and
i
be
proud
that
we
be
lead
the
way
there
be
however
one
stubborn
issue
that
need
to
be
resolve
first
with
respect
to
liability
related
provision
in
the
us
the
public
readiness
and
emergency
preparedness
prep
act
provide
broad
protection
to
biopharmaceutical
company
and
others
that
make
medicine
and
equipment
use
to
combat
a
pandemic
against
certain
liability
during
the
public
health
emergency
it
also
provide
compensation
to
individual
if
they
suffer
harm
from
these
essential
product
but
most
of
these
country
do
not
have
these
protection
and
in
a
few
instance
especially
in
low
and
middle
income
country
the
government
or
judicial
system
be
not
well
equip
to
adjudicate
claim
against
manufacturer
particularly
in
the
context
of
a
pandemic
we
therefore
have
to
discus
with
government
solution
that
be
fair
to
both
side
and
would
ensure
that
the
company
have
appropriate
liability
protection
give
the
unprecedented
circumstance
we
be
face
to
be
clear
we
have
always
have
confidence
that
our
vaccine
be
both
safe
and
effective
but
because
of
the
sheer
number
of
patient
receive
our
vaccine
individual
in
country
around
the
world
could
blame
our
vaccine
for
health
condition
that
be
completely
unrelated
to
the
vaccine
bring
claim
against
us
in
numerous
different
court
and
put
us
at
substantial
financial
risk
while
i
be
concerned
about
the
potential
for
litigation
however
unfounded
or
require
my
team
to
navigate
foreign
legal
system
i
also
knew
that
we
must
find
a
solution
and
not
allow
the
challenge
of
liability
protection
to
be
a
barrier
for
lifesaving
vaccine
to
reach
the
poorest
country
in
the
world
after
weigh
the
pro
and
con
i
decide
to
move
ahead
with
this
option
and
honor
our
commitment
to
equity
by
agree
to
route
the
five
hundred
million
vaccine
through
the
covax
facility
we
be
able
to
obtain
legal
protection
for
our
company
even
if
less
than
what
be
offer
under
the
prep
act
but
most
important
it
allow
us
to
ensure
that
our
dos
would
be
provide
to
country
that
be
so
desperately
in
need
i
knew
i
be
take
a
risk
by
agree
to
deliver
dos
to
these
country
in
this
manner
but
i
felt
it
be
a
reasonable
option
for
the
company
and
i
could
sleep
well
at
night
once
the
detail
have
be
sort

up
again
to
do
the
right
thing
for

and
restore

during
a
visit
to
the
united
state
he
be
eager

be
host
in
japan
athlete
and
delegate
would
be
in
close
proximity
to
one
another
i
thought
it
would
be
a
terrible
loss
if
the
olympics
have
to
be
postpone
for
a
second
time
for
me
the
olympic
game
be
a
great
demonstration
of
modern
democracy
in
the
past
war
and
conflict
be
pause
during
the
olympics
the
modern
game
get
their
start
in
after
the
french
baron
pierre
de
coubertin
become
so
inspire
by
the
olympic
ideal
that
he
form
the
international
olympic
committee
ioc
today
the
olympics
brings
people
from
around
the
world
together
in
a
celebration
of
our
connect
humanity
i
be
seriously
concerned
that
cancel
the
olympics
would
signal
that
a
virus
have
won
have
beaten
our
global
civilization
after

the
japanese
prime
minister

ioc
and
offer
our
help

the
ioc
president
thomas
bach
that
we
want
to
help
vaccinate
athlete
and
their
delegation
the
number
of
dos
require
be
not
large
the
logistics
however
be
more
significant
in
may
we
announce
the
signing
of
a
memorandum
of
understand
with
the
ioc
to
donate

this

be
another
tool
in
our

of
measure
to
help
make

game
tokyo

secure
for

be
an

symbolic
victory
for
science
and
humanity
later

only
extend
an
invitation
to
me

but
to
my
surprise
also
invite
me
to
carry

i
be
both
honor
and
humble
unfortunately
due

restriction
i
be
ultimately
unable
to
carry
the
torch
but
i
do
attend
the
opening
ceremony
and
the
experience
be
among
the
highlight
of
my
life
and
president
bach
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
a
torch
which
i
proudly
brought
home
with
me
occasionally
enlighten
leader
would
look
beyond
the
current
crisis
to
express
interest
in
the
science
how
can
our
brightest
scientist
collaborate
with
your
best
scientist
to
prepare
for
the
next
crisis
the
uk
s
prime
minister
boris
johnson
be
one
of
those
leader
unfortunately
during
our
discussion
we
nearly
create
an
international
incident
the
prime
minister
and
i
spoke
on
january
in
the
early
even
london
time
be
the
first
country
to
approve
our
vaccine
the
uk
have
already
vaccinate
million
people
and
have
million
dos
on
order
he
want
to
increase
that
number
we
be
lose
the
elderly
he
told
us
they
have
the
people
available
now
and
the
healthcare
system
to
make
it
happen
they
plan
to
move
three
million
dos
from
february
forward
to
january
if
pfizer
have
more
dos
the
uk
be
keen
to
use
them
from
my
perspective
the
uk
be
do
an
exceptional
job
under
tremendous
pressure
it
also
have
an
emerge
variant
originate
from
india
that
be
create
new
concern
and
month
later
would
be
know
as
the
delta
variant
mikael
dolsten
spoke
up
to
assure
the
prime
minister
we
be
follow
the
variant
carefully
and
believe
our
vaccine
would
protect
against
it
on
the
basis
of
the
knowledge
we
have
i
commit
that
we
could
meet
his
request
for
more
dos
by
the
end
of
the
call
a
photograph
be
take
of
the
videoconference
screen
that
the
prime
minister
later
post
to
linkedin
and
he
told
us
he
would
ask
the
uk
to
applaud
pfizer
during
one
of
its
even
rally
my
team
and
i
left
that
meeting
full
of
pride
later
in
the
day
however
i
learn
that
our
team
do
not
believe
we
could
deliver
on
the
promise
supply
a
member
of
the
team
have
make
an
honest
mistake
and
double
count
the
available
dos
and
we
didn
t
actually
have
three
million
dos
unless
we
take
them
from
someone
else
which
of
course
would
not
be
fair
or
ethical
i
felt
awful
and
have
to
call
the
prime
minister
back
he
be
gracious
but
told
us
the
news
hit
very
hard
they
be
depend
on
the
dos
to
meet
goal
i
told
him
we
would
work
through
the
weekend
to
explore
every
possibility
to
increase
the
schedule
dos
i
have
make
a
personal
commitment
and
because
of
this
the
uk
prime
minister
have
make
a
promise
to
the
people
of
his
country
i
be
not
go
to
take
that
back
i
be
honor
bound
our
team
go
back
to
the
draw
board
we
identify
a
surplus
of
dos
create
by
the
slowness
of
the
us
government
to
distribute
dos
in
january
during
the
last
week
of
the
trump
administration
however
vaccine
dos
manufacture
in
the
us
use
the
dpa
could
not
be
export
internationally
fortunately
those
surplus
dos
have
be
manufacture
at
our
facility
in
europe
and
sent
to
the
us

no
prohibition
on

at
that
time
the
uk
be
the
only
country
vaccinate
so
quickly
that
demand
surpass
supply
as
a
result
we
work
on
a
plan
to
meet
the
uk
s
need
examine
it
carefully
and
give
the
green
light
to
ship
those
dos
to
the
uk
we
schedule
a
call
with
the
prime
minister
for
our
morning
time
on
martin
luther
king

monday

i
told
him
we
have
good
news
i
take
personal
responsibility
and
apologize
for
the
concern
we
have
cause
the
prime
minister
appreciate
the
transparency
and
the
effort
he
thanked
us
all
and
then
add
that
he
have
study
up
on
mrna
he
told
me
he
felt
it
be
one
of
the
more
important
technology
of
the
future
it
be
something
he
want
to
work
with
pfizer
on
at
every
level
to
help
protect
our
population
in
the
future
so
we
could
make
sure
when
new
variant
arise
we
could
rapidly
turn
thing
around
i
hope
that
our
team
can
take
that
forward
for
my
own
team
what
i
hop
to
model
here
be
a
set
of
value
that
mean
a
lot
to
me
take
responsibility
be
accountable
don
t
try
to
hide
figure
out
how
to
fix
it
and
apologize
directly

what
you
have
learn
like
the
uk
canada

in
line
behind
european
country
and
i
assure
him
that
canada
be
well
position
but
also
acknowledge
that
negotiation
with
europe
be
important
to
our
mutual
interest
since
our
site
in
puurs
belgium
be
a
critical
part
of
the
solution
and
we
could
not
afford
upset
europe
and
risk
shut
down
export
i
d
already
heard
from
the
trump
white
house
that
it
want
all
us
supply
for
us
purpose
canada
would

all
be
face
the
dual
challenge
of
a
health
crisis
and
an
economic
crisis
they
felt
they
have
to
solve
for
health
first
our
call
with
brazilian
official
include
president
bolsonaro
be
heartbreaking
the
country
have
be
slow
to

initially
prefer
chinese
and
russian
vaccine
the
slowness
and
miscue

political
problem
for
them
and
bad

during
the

we
must
set
aside
the
politics
and
finally
face
this
pandemic
as
one
nation
he
told
a
global
audience
in
april
as
more
and
more
people
be
vaccinate
i
flew
to
our
manufacturing
site
in
puurs
to
tour
our
facility
with
the
european
commission

ursula
von
der
leyen
and
the
prime
minister
of
belgium
alexander
de
croo
it
be
the
first
time
i
have
the
pleasure
of

very
similar
personality
my
team
be
impressed
with
not
only
her

but
also

their
discovery
to
life
i
say
that
the
pfizer
biontech
partnership
be
not
only
about
science
not
only
about
competency
but
also
about

dos
to
vaccinate
percent
of
the

population
in
the

in

the
story
of
our
approach
for
israel
be
very
different
and
merit
a
chapter
of
its
own

a
beacon
of
hope
what
be
common
to
all
men
hope
because
those
who
have
nothing
else
posse
hope
still
thales
of
miletus
bc
when
we
start
the
first
vaccine
shipment
to
people
around
the
world
the
excitement
be
very
high
but
then
the
reality
hit
i
have
be
tell
everyone
that
the
vaccine
could
come
by
october
but
it
turn
out
that
very
few
people
besides
me
be
expect
this
really
to
happen
clearly
the
delivery
machine
be
not
ready
in
almost
every
country
the
ability
of
the
health
authority
to
administer
the
available
dos
be
not
stellar
in
the
begin
there
be
more
dos
available
than
what
they
could
absorb
and
when
the
vaccination
rate
start
pick
up
then
the
production
could
not
meet
the
demand
and
become
a
bottleneck
i
realize
that
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
have
enough
people
vaccinate
so
that
we
could
see
tangible
measurable
result
the
hope
create
by
the
first
vaccination
fade
quickly
as
daily
life
remain
the
same
we
need
an
example
to
demonstrate
to
the
world
that
the
hope
be
real
the
idea
be
to
select
a
country
that
if
it
be
give
uninterrupted
supply
could
ensure
quick
vaccination
all
the
way
to
herd
immunity
and
demonstrate
the
impact
on
health
and
economic
index
ideally
the
country
would
be
relatively
small
and
have
high
standard
for
its
health
system
and
good
electronic
medical
record
benjamin
bibi
netanyahu
the
prime
minister
of
israel
at
the
time
be
among
the
first
to
call
me
to
advocate
for
earlier
delivery
in
his
country
our
initial
conversation
be
very
casual
he
told
me
he
have
found
out
i
be
a
greek
jew
from
the
greek
prime
minister
kyriakos
mitsotakis
who
be
very
proud
of
me
as
we
continued
our
discussion
i
reveal
that
mikael
dolsten
our
head
of
research
be
a
swedish
jew
who
during
medical
school
obtain
a
fellowship
at
the
weizmann
institute
a
renowned
israeli
scientific
institution
now
i
be
really
piss
with
our
intelligence
guy
the
prime
minister
respond
his
amusement
barely
disguise
they
didn
t
tell
me
this
either
i
be
think
that
it
wouldn
t
make
a
difference
for
the
discussion
we
be
about
to
have
but
i
told
him
jokingly
to
let
it
go
because
i
didn
t
wish
to
be
between
mossad
and
his
frustration
with
them
after
these
initial
talk
he
start
push
for
earlier
delivery
to
israel
as
with
all
other
head
of
state
i
explain
the
supply
situation
ask
for
his
patience
and
promise
to
do
my
best
netanyahu
knew
a
lot
of
technical
detail
about
the
virus
and
the
different
vaccine
and
he
be
the
first
leader
who
spoke
about
herd
immunity
his
knowledge
and
direct
style
caught
my
attention
and
start
me
wonder
if
israel
could
be
the
country
to
demonstrate
the
benefit
of
widespread
vaccination
i
call
dr
luis
jodar
our
tenacious
chief
medical
officer
for
vaccine
who
have
a
strong
commitment
to
patient
i
ask
luis
the
question
and
he
be
enthusiastic
israel
have
the
right
size
with
tightly
control
border
it
have
an
excellent
healthcare
system
with
electronic
medical
record
for
more
than
percent
of
its
citizen
and
the
country
be
experience
a
very
tough
situation
with
covid
infection
healthcare
in
israel
be
universal
with
government
fund
participation
in
one
of
four
nationwide
medical
insurance
program
that
operate
as
health
maintenance
organization
all
israeli
resident
be
assign
unique
identification
number
that
enable
data
linkage
in
the
national
medical
record
database
i
ask
luis
to
include
israel
on
the
list
of
candidate
country
and
to
calculate
the
number
of
dos
it
would
require
for
herd
immunity
two
day
later
i
receive
another
call
on
my
cell
phone
from
prime
minister
netanyahu
i
be
surprised
because
it
seem
too
soon
for
a
second
call
and
he
hadn
t
even
bother
to
schedule
it
he
d
just
call
he
brought
to
my
attention
some
legal
issue
related
to
our
contract
negotiation
for
delivery
of
the
vaccine
i
be
not
aware
of
the
detail
and
promise
to
come
back
to
him
doug
lankler
our
general
counsel
and
a
trust
advisor
explain
to
me
his
concern
and
i
call
netanyahu
back
a
few
hour
later
he
return
my
call
ron
dermer
israel
s
ambassador
to
the
us
be
already
on
the
line
together
with
israel
s
national
security
advisor
i
look
at
my
watch
and
calculate
the
time
in
israel
i
be
shock
prime
minister
it
be
two
thirty
in
the
morning
don
t
worry
about
that
i
don
t
need
much
sleep
he
reply
look
albert
if
we
leave
this
just
to
the
lawyer
we
will
never
get
it
do
i
will
conference
our
head
lawyer
now
can
you
do
the
same
i
felt
a
little
bit
uncomfortable
but
i
be
also
intrigue
by
his
decisiveness
and
sense
of
urgency
i
conferenced
doug
and
netanyahu
conferenced
a
couple
of
lawyer
i
think
they
be
from
a
us
legal
firm
represent
the
state
of
israel
in
the
discussion
that
follow
i
be
impressed
by
ambassador
dermer
who
come
up
with
some
brilliant
solution
by
a
m
israel
time
most
of
the
issue
be
resolve
with
only
a
few
of
them
remain
on
the
table
for
those
we
agree
that
the
legal
team
would
explore
solution
during
our
morning
the
initial
contract
be
sign
a
couple
day
later
and
i
thought
this
be
the
last
time
i
would
hear
from
bibi
in
the
meantime
luis
have
calculate
the
dos
we
would
need
for
israel
to
reach
herd
immunity
and
i
kept
star
at
the
list
of
country
fitting
the
criterion
for
an
observational
study
which
one
could
execute
faster
and
well
israel
be
at
the
top
of
the
list
but
there
be
a
problem
if
that
country
be
select
everyone
would
think
it
be
because
of
my
jewish
heritage
i
be
think
about
engage
our
office
in
israel
to
answer
some
of
my
question
about
their
vaccination
plan
but
suddenly
the
phone
rang
again
and
netanyahu
be
on
the
line
ron
dermer
be
with
him
the
prime
minister
start
talk
again
about
the
need
to
receive
more
dos
because
of
the
bad
situation
in
israel
i
explain
that
unfortunately
this
be
the
reality
all
over
the
world
but
i
start
ask
question
about
their
vaccination
program
once
more
i
be
impressed
by
his
knowledge
of
the
detail
he
spoke
about
their
hospital
his
intention
to
deploy
the
army
his
green
pas
idea
and
their
plan
to
address
vaccine
hesitation
he
be
clearly
on
top
of
thing
suddenly
dermer
suspect
the
importance
of
this
to
me
and
start
sell
even
more
of
israel
s
ability
to
execute
in
crisis
we
be
a
society
that
have
learn
to
live
under
constant
threat
free
spirit
as
we
be
during
period
of
peace
we
be
the
most
discipline
during
period
of
crisis
netanyahu
sync
immediately
with
ron
and
start
hype
israel
s
capability
the
next
day
i
spoke
to
mikael
luis
and
doug
about
the
possibility
of
select
israel
as
the
country
to
demonstrate
to
the
world
what
our
vaccine
could
do
we
all
agree
that
israel
could
be
the
ideal
place
to
do
this
you
know
everyone
will
think
we
do
this
because
we
be
jew
i
texted
mikael
i
know
but
they
be
the
right
bet
he
reply
i
plan
to
call
the
prime
minister
to
discus
the
possibility
of
a
real
world
evidence
research
collaboration
where
we
would
have
observational
nonrandomized
noncontrolled
data
we
would
provide
dos
under
the
previously
negotiate
vaccine
supply
agreement
and
in
return
israel
would
commit
to
move
very
fast
and
publishing
the
real
world
efficacy
data
of
course
the
next
day
he
call
before
i
even
have
a
chance
to
call
him
i
brought
him
the
idea
for
a
research
collaboration
in
a
little
more
than
a
week
we
sign
a
research
collaboration
agreement
with
the
ministry
of
health
and
we
form
a
steer
committee
with
epidemiologist
from
israel
pfizer
and
harvard
university
in
time
the
story
of
israel
would
inspire
and
inform
the
world
by
early
march
we
be
prepare
to
publish
interim
result
from
the
vaccine
campaign
in
israel
i
want
to
be
there
on
march
because
it
would
be
the
one
year
anniversary
of
the
world
health
organization
proclaim
covid
a
pandemic
my
plan
be
to
visit
country
in
the
area
include
israel
but
several
obstacle
stood
in
the
way
one
of
those
obstacle
be
the
come
israeli
election
the
legislative
election
be
hotly
contest
and
the
potential
for
my
visit
ahead
of
the
vote
be
leak
to
the
press
create
a
few
local
news
report
because
of
my
family
s
story
of
narrow
escape
from
the
holocaust
and
pfizer
s
success
with
the
vaccine
my
profile
there
be
high
many
people
reach
out
to
me
with
advice
half
told
me
not
to
come
because
it
might
interfere
with
the
process
the
other
half
insist
i
come
the
other
obstacle
be
my
own
vaccination
get
vaccinate
have
create
a
crisis
of
conscience
for
me
on
the
one
hand
i
be
eager
to
show
the
world
that
the
pfizer
ceo
be
first
in
line
because
he
have
confidence
in
the
vaccine
on
the
other
hand
i
didn
t
want
to
step
in
front
of
those
who
need
it
more
in
those
early
day
of
the
vaccine
there
be
long
line
await
the
jab
vaccine
hesitancy
be
low
among
those
who
need
it
most
demand
be
high
and
the
state
be
still
figure
out
logistics
i
decide
to
wait
my
turn
not
to
cut
the
line
my
predicament
however
be
upset
because
i
want
to
do
what
be
right
we
debate
the
decision
we
look
at
opinion
result
show
that
the
public
want
to
see
their
own
doctor
and
other
healthcare
leader
get
vaccinate
thus
reassure
patient
it
be
safe
but
if
i
be
vaccinate
i
would
want
my
team
to
be
vaccinate
and
so
on
along
the
line
of
management
i
chose
to
wait
until
my
vaccination
might
be
use
to
encourage
those
with
vaccine
hesitancy
later
on
nevertheless
netanyahu
ask
me
repeatedly
during
our
call
if
i
have
be
vaccinate
israel
be
move
very
quickly
and
he
say
constituent
kept
ask
him
if
i
have
take
it
i
knew
that
he
also
care
deeply
about
me
during
this
difficult
period
in
which
we
be
work
so
closely
together
to
find
solution
to
a
devastate
pandemic
we
become
very
close
and
we
share
many
personal
story
as
we
be
usually
talk
during
late
evening
israel
time
he
would
talk
to
me
about
his
difficult
day
or
his
family
and
i
would
do
the
same
i
know
i
be
like
a
jewish
mother
to
you
on
this
but

on

twenty
one

later

as

therefore
be
ultimately

i

many
people
be

disappointed
with
my

many

happy
they
thought
that
my

could
send
a
political
message
amid
a
polarize

i
hop
it
could

story
remain
with
me
early
in
our
discussion
he
have
congratulate
me
on
the
vaccine
s
success
i
always
correct
leader
when
they
say
that
in

it
be
the
great
people
i
work
with
at
pfizer
who
have
make
the
impossible
possible
i
told
the
prime
minister
it
be
a
team
effort
he
listen
appreciatively
but
then
told
me
a
story
when
netanyahu
be
in
his
early
day
of
israel
s
military
training
and
service
he
graduate

note

later
he
complain

yonatan
a
more

and
more
season
commander
look
at
what
happen
to
me
he
say
they
didn
t
give
me
the
good
soldier
yonatan
told
his

bibi
please
remember
there
be
not

after

replace
on
june
by
his
former
chief
of
staff
naftali

as

bennett
form
a

up
of
party
across
the
political
spectrum
who
oppose
netanyahu
for
a
variety
of
political
and
other
issue
but
it
become
clear
from
the
outset
that
when
it
come
to
defeat
the
virus
there
be
virtually
no
daylight
between
the
new
government
and
the
old
i
picked
up
a
dialogue
with
bennett
as
i
have
with
netanyahu
and
our
scientist
and
researcher
continued
work
with
the
israeli
scientist
as
if
there
have
be
no
election
at
all
even
though
the
top
minister
have
change
over
with
the
switch
in
government
there
be
remarkable
continuity
between
the
team
work
directly
with
pfizer
on
our
important
project
bennett
initiate
our
personal
relationship
at
the
end
of
june
approximately
two
week
after
he
take
over
israel
have
a
small
number
of
dos
that
be
approach
their
expiry
date
and
he
want
us
to
facilitate
move
these
dos
to
another
country
so
they
could
be
use
immediately
the
plan
be
to
give
these
dos
to
the
palestinian
national
authority
but
at
the
last
moment
the
palestinian
refuse
to
accept
them
and
now
there
be
an
urgent
need
to
resolve
this
there
be
a
lot
of
challenge
but
i
agree
with
him
that
it
would
be
terrible
if
we
let
lifesaving
dos
expire
because
of
technical
or
bureaucratic
issue
in
the
day
that
follow
we
start
texting
each
other
and
talk
on
the
phone
daily
about
this
issue
until
eventually
a
deal
be
make
between
israel
and
south
korea
and
pfizer
facilitate
the
transfer
bennett
would
call
me
or
text
me
regularly
to
discus
the
progress
our
research
collaboration
with
israel
become
the
most
reliable
scientific
tool
the
world
have
to
ass
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
our
vaccine
and
the
impact
of
vaccination
program
on
the
health
and
socioeconomic
index
of
a
country
every
tuesday
the
israeli
scientist
share
with
our
expert
weekly
data
analyze
in
multiple
different
way
due
to
israel
s
high
level
of
vaccination
rate
its
outstanding
electronic
health
record
system
and
its
extensive
program
of
test
we
be
able
to
have
a
very
accurate
picture
of
the
performance
of
our
vaccine
and
observe
any
potential
change
in
a
timely
manner
the
result
be
amaze
and
israel
be
able
to
completely
open
its
economy
and
lift
most
restriction
while
maintain
a
very
low
number
of
case
predominantly
within
the
unvaccinated
population
but
israeli
never
stop
test
for
covid
monitoring
the
disease
among
their
citizen
and
share
their
data
with
us
as
we
have
agree
when
we
sign
our
research
collaboration
in
late
june
we
start
notice
a
rapid
rise
of
case
across
the
country
because
of
our
close
collaboration
and
the
excellent
system
we
have
put
in
place
we
be
able
to
quickly
identify
whether
the
case
be
among
unvaccinated
people
or
be
breakthrough
infection
infection
among
vaccinate
people
and
within
the
breakthrough
population
the
personal
characteristic
of
those
who
be
be
infect
include
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
case
this
be
critical
the
rise
in
infection
be
occur
with
the
introduction
of
the
more
infectious
delta
variant
and
what
we
need
to
determine
quickly
be
whether
the
upsurge
in
case
be
cause
by
lack
of
efficacy
of
the
vaccine
against
this
variant
or
the
gradual
loss
of
efficacy
over
time
this
have
critical
implication
not
just
for
israel
but
also
for
the
world
because
if
the
former
be
true
then
a
new
vaccine
tailor
make
to
prevent
the
delta
variant
need
to
be
developed
immediately
our
analysis
reveal
that
the
efficacy
of
the
vaccine
be
wan
over
time
and
most
specifically
among
the
individual
vaccinate
in
large
number
begin
in
december
however
among
those
who
have
receive
the
vaccine
only
recently
it
be
hold
up
strongly
at
prevent
both
infection
and
severe
disease
due
to
delta
at
the
begin
the
wan
of
efficacy
be
result
in
only
a
low
level
of
infection
and
mild
disease
unfortunately
as
time
pass
and
the
number
of
reinfected
individual
grow
the
rate
of
hospitalization
and
severe
disease
case
also
start
to
increase
in
the
most
vulnerable
population
that
be
first
vaccinate
make
the
question
even
more
urgent
of
whether
a
booster
dose
be
need
our
study
evaluate
the
impact
of
a
booster
dose
be
ongoing
and
the
first
result
be
very
positive
in
both
the
safety
and
efficacy
domain
with
data
come
out
of
israel
on
the
wan
of
immunity
start
approximately
six
month
after
the
second
dose
i
strongly
believe
that
it
be
our
moral
imperative
to
share
this
information
more
widely
we
have
vowed
to
always
be
transparent
and
we
kept
this
promise
throughout
the
pandemic
this
help
us
build
a
very
high
level
of
trust
among
the
public
now
for
the
first
time
we
learn
information
that
raise
concern
about
our
vaccine
s
duration
of
protection
stick
to
our
principle
to
share
information
publicly
i
ask
my
team
to
prepare
a
press
release
on
july
detail
our
finding
from
israel
as
see
in
real
world
data
release
from
the
israel
ministry
of
health
vaccine
efficacy
in
prevent
both
infection
and
symptomatic
disease
have
decline
six
month
post
vaccination
although
efficacy
in
prevent
serious
illness
remains
high
we
say
in
this
joint
pfizer
biontech
release
additionally
during
this
period
the
delta
variant
be
become
the
dominant
variant
in
israel
as
well
as
many
other
country
these
finding
be
consistent
with
an
ongoing
analysis
from
the
company
phase
study
at
the
same
time
we
inform
the
public
about
our
encourage
data
from
the
booster
study
initial
data
from
the
study
demonstrate
that
a
booster
dose
give
month
after
the
second
dose
have
a
consistent
tolerability
profile
while
elicit
high
neutralization
titer
against
the
wild
type
and
the
beta
variant
which
be
to
time
high
than
after
two
primary
dos
finally
we
state
that
be
why
we
have
say
and
we
continue
to
believe
that
it
be
likely
base
on
the
totality
of
the
data
we
have
to
date
that
a
third
dose
may
be
need
within
to
month
after
full
vaccination
while
protection
against
severe
disease
remain
high
across
the
full
month
a
decline
in
efficacy
against
symptomatic
disease
over
time
and
the
continued
emergence
of
variant
be
expect
base
on
the
totality
of
the
data
they
have
to
date
pfizer
and
biontech
believe
that
a
third
dose
may
be
beneficial
to
maintain
the
high
level
of
protection
in
the
past
politician
and
government
would
pressure
us
to
share
data
and
learning
more
quickly
than
we
be
comfortable
in
this
case
we
believe
that
we
be
share
timely
data
that
could
be
critical
for
government
around
the
world
to
make
significant
public
health
decision
to
our
surprise
our
release
set
off
a
firestorm
with
us
health
official
in
response
to
our
statement
the
cdc
and
the
fda
take
the
unprecedented
step
before
ask
to
see
our
data
to
put
out
their
own
statement
that
refute
our
release
s
conclusion
that
booster
would
be
require
it
be
understandable
that
when
complex
public
health
challenge
politics
and
science
intersect
thing
can
get
messy
we
have
always
try
to
keep
it
simple
follow
the
science
wherever
it
take
us
and
be
candid
with
the
public
about
what
we
be
see
that
s
what
we
do
when
we
make
the
booster
news
public
i
believe
that
the
us
official
get
concerned
that
our
announcement
would
increase
vaccine
hesitancy
we
saw
it
differently
our
evidence
to
date
indicate
that
the
vaccine
be
still
effective
at
prevent
hospitalization
and
severe
illness
even
after
several
month
but
that
protection
against
infection
wan
most
important
we
be
announce
that
we
have
a
possible
solution
in
hand
to
address
wan
infection
efficacy
and
the
more
modest
decrease
in
effectiveness
against
severe
illness
in
retrospect
we
should
have
give
the
us
agency
a
head
up
before
make
our
finding
public
this
be
a
mistake
on
our
side
i
call
both
tony
fauci
and
jeff
zients
to
apologize
for
catch
the
administration
off
guard
i
emphasize
though
that
our
scientist
strongly
believe
in
the
validity
of
our
conclusion
and
i
offer
to
schedule
a
meeting
where
a
group
of
pfizer
scientist
could
brief
the
appropriate
us
health
official
on
the
totality
of
the
data
we
have
at
our
disposal
both
of
them

happily
to
do
that
this

with
the

that
the

commissioner
stephen

have
told
the

in
an
interview
that
he
be
willing
to
bypass
the
normal
approval
process
to
make
matter
bad
computer
hacker
propaganda
and
misinformation
campaign
fuel
misunderstand
and
confusion
that
summer
our
executive
team
thought
deeply
about
something
big
than
politics
the
public
s
trust
we
be
aware
of
attitude
toward
the
pharmaceutical
industry
which
compete
with
tobacco
and
government
for
the
bottom
rung
of
reputational
survey
the
industry
have
do
a
lot
of
thing
in
the
past
to
lose
trust
from
people
as
a
result
we
also
have
to
be
concerned
about
our
own
company
reputation
and
the
reputation
of
the
vaccine
itself
earn
and
maintain
the
public
s
trust
be
essential
we
know
that
a
strong
reputation
be
earn
in
drop
but
lose
in
bucket
we
must
earn
trust
every
day
because
our
patient
expect
it
with
covid
infection
rate
on
the
rise
and
an
imperative
vaccine
on
its
way
communication
and
government
affair
would
be
essential
and
would
play
a
major
role
in
our
lightspeed
deliberation
we
begin
immediately
and
aggressively
to
push
back
on
notion
that
the
vaccine
would
skip
or
short
circuit
phase
trial
we
be
move
fast
but
not
cut
corner
the
heat
political
debate
be
not
help
for
me
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel
s
back
be
a
tweet
from
president
donald
trump
about
the
fda
president
trump
would
ask
me
in
every
call
i
have
with
him
during
this
period
if
we
have
problem
with
the
fda
it
felt
as
if
he
be
try
to
get
a
statement
from
me
that
the
fda
be
do
something
bad
in
all
case
my
answer
be
very
clear
the
fda
be
do
an
exceptionally
good
job
in
collaborate
with
us
on
this
project
however
on
saturday
august
he
tweet
the
deep
state
or
whoever
over
at
the
fda
be
make
it
difficult
for
drug
company
to
get
people
in
order
to
test
the
vaccine
and
therapeutic
obviously
they
be
hop
to
delay
the
answer
until
after
november
rd
must
focus
on
speed
and
save
life
i
become
seriously
concerned
with
this
turn
if
people
start
doubt
the
fda
s
integrity
how
would
they
trust
a
vaccine
that
would
be
approve
by
them
if
it
be
approve
before
the
election
some
might
think
that
this
be
the
result
of
the
political
pressure
from
the
white
house
if
it
be
approve
after
the
election
others
might
think
that
this
be
the
result
of
the
political
pressure
from
the
biden
campaign
either
case
would
not
help
build
people
s
trust
in
the
process
and
the
vaccine
and
would
bring
more
bad
news
for
public
health
we
have
to
do
something
during
the
crisis
i
become
quite
close
with
alex
gorsky
the
chairman
and
ceo
of
johnson
johnson
the
two
of
us
would
talk
on
the
phone
regularly
on
weekend
and
discus
the
situation
with
covid
and
the
challenge
we
be
face
with
i
call
alex
to
discus
my
concern
about
the
political
environment
and
the
political
pressure
during
our
discussion
we
agree
that
we
must
speak
up
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
write
a
statement
assure
the
world
that
we
would
not
cut
any
corner
let
me
draft
something
and
send
it
to
you
i
told
alex
i
call
sally
susman
and
over
one
weekend
we
resolve
to
draft
a
public
pledge
that
biopharma
leader
include
myself
would
sign
to
unite
in
solidarity
for
science
and
with
regulator
charge
with
the
public
safety
politician
and
pundit
might
advocate
for
weaken
the
scientific
approach
but
we
would
not
in
the
pledge
we
write
the
agency
require
that
scientific
evidence
for
regulatory
approval
must
come
from
large
high
quality
clinical
trial
that
be
randomize
and
observer
blind
with
an
expectation
of
appropriately
design
study
with
significant
number
of
participant
across
diverse
population
we
pledge
to
always
make
the
safety
and
well
be
of
vaccinate
individual
our
top
priority
to
continue
to
adhere
to
high
scientific
and
ethical
standard
regard
the
conduct
of
clinical
trial
and
the
rigor
of
manufacturing
process
to
only
submit
for
approval
or
emergency
use
authorization
after
demonstrate
safety
and
efficacy
through
a
phase
clinical
study
that
be
design
and
conduct
to
meet
requirement
of
expert
regulatory
authority
such
as
the
fda
and
to
work
to
ensure

i
knew
that
their

i

care
for
that
be
the
fertile
ground
in
which
trust
take
root
and
grows
if
the
vaccine
taught
us
anything
about
public
perception
it
be
that
our
purpose
breakthrough
that
change
patient
life
be
the
only
pathway
to
a
sound
reputation

we
will
guard
it
with
vigilance

a
pro

pro
innovation
agenda
what
you
leave
behind
be
not
what
be
engrave
in

but
what
be
woven
into
the
life
of
others
pericles
bc
on
may
president
kennedy
told
congress
i
believe
that
this
nation
should
commit
itself
to
achieve
the
goal
before
this
decade
be
out
of
land
a
man
on
the
moon
and
return
him
safely
to
the
earth
eight
year
later
on
july
that
mission
be
accomplish
yet
in
many
way
the
moonshot
continue
as
humankind
explores
the
cosmos
beyond
the
moon
and
president
biden
challenge
the
nation
to
embrace
a
science
base
future
similarly
our
moonshot
also
continue
on
may
six
month
after
our
breakthrough
i
told
colleague
and
stakeholder
during
our
quarterly
earnings
report
that
i
could
not
be
prouder
of
pfizer
on
that
day
we
be
on
track
to
produce
billion
dos
of
covid
vaccine
by
end
of
the
year
and
billion
in
we
d
also
proven
that
we
be
not
a
one
hit
wonder
exclude
the
revenue
earn
from
our
covid
vaccine
pfizer
s
revenue
grow
percent
operationally
in
q
in
fact
we
also
achieve
several
important
clinical
regulatory
and
commercial
milestone
we
have
make
a
tremendous
gambit
to
find
a
safe
effective
vaccine
science
have
won
we
have
learn
a
lot
about
what
it
take
to
be
passionate
and
highly
effective
in
drive
innovation
and
impact
the
life
of
so
many
people
in
the
precede
chapter
i
ve
explore
the
science
technology
and
business
approach
we
pioneer
under
tremendous
pressure
with
covid
everyone
be
at
risk
so
everyone
be
align
in
find
a
cure
but
most
disease
do
not
affect
everyone
which
too
often
lead
to
a
lack
of
alignment
on
how
to
approach
healthcare
result
in
inefficiency
and
inequity
in
this
final
chapter
i
look
ahead
to
how
we
might
apply
what
we
learn
to
future
innovation
and
patient
advance
in
a
five
point
recommendation
improve
access
and
reimbursement
practice
we
must
drive
policy
that
reduce
out
of
pocket
expense
for
patient
cost
have
grown
and
as
a
society
we
be
put
more
cost
on
the
patient
in
the
united
state
medicare
part
d
for
example
have
no
cap
on
out
of
pocket
expense
so
a
patient
who
may
need
bespoke
treatment
such
as
immuno
and
gene
therapy
could
be
on
the
hook
for
more
than
percent
of
expense
no
matter
how
high
those
expense
go
these
expense
become
consequential
for
many
family
in
some
case
biopharma
invests
in
research
focus
on
discover
innovative
medicine
that
may
serve
only
a
small
group
of
patient
afflict
with
a
specific
condition
because
of
the
small
number
of
patient
treatment
can
be
expensive
how
can
we
as
a
society
and
an
industry
share
in
those
cost
to
ensure
the
burden
be
not
unjustly
place
on
the
patient
also
how
can
we
ensure
that
patient
input
be
appropriately
weight
and
consider
by
payer
one
approach
be
to
increase
participation
by
patient
advocacy
group
in
what
be
know
as
health
technology
assessment
hta
decision
htas
be
the
mechanism
by
which
government
and
other
healthcare
payer
evaluate
the
impact
of
a
particular
medicine
or
technology
we
need
to
increase
the
number
of
hta
body
that
have
a
specific
criterion
or
process
to
evaluate
patient
evidence
europe
s
htas
be
a
complex
formula
that
run
cost
and
benefit
through
a
wringer
in
order
to
spit
out
the
perceive
value
of
the
medicine
only
that
formula
do
not
account
for
patient
benefit
like
whether
a
parent
can
continue
to
care
for
their
child
or
a
colleague
can
continue
to
benefit
from
the
dignity
that
come
from
go
to
work
it
only
examines
under
the
most
rigid
formula
direct
cost
to
the
healthcare
system
we
believe
the
wellness
and
productivity
of
the
patient
should
be
take
into
consideration
we
also
need
to
advance
the
use
of
value
base
pricing
and
payment
model
to
do
so
mean
reduce
barrier
to
the
adoption
of
value
base
agreement
we

faster
by
work
with

model
we

how

we
well
account

while

discount

these

be
often
well
fund
but
allocate

to
less
efficient
part
of
the

system
but
in
many
low

middle

country
the
basic
infrastructure
to

be
inadequate
meaning
many
innovative

be
out
of
reach
for

in
these

it
be
critical
that
government

collaborate
to
close
this

gap
that
be
why
we
have
work

promote

to

we

partner
with
a

ping

commercial
health

individual
in
that

the

will
supplement
the

an
incredible
journey
back
in
march
of
when
we
decide
to
pursue
a
vaccine
for
covid
very
few
believe
we
would
be
able
to
deliver
one
in
less
than
a
year
and
secure
full
fda
approval
in
less
than
month
but
you
do
you
believe
in
our
science
you
believe
in
our
people
you
believe
in
our
purpose
and
you
believe
in
one
another
thank
you
for
your
leadership
your
excellence
and
your
friendship
we
never
could

much
so
quickly
without
your
expertise
courage
and

the
journey
be
far
from
over
but
with

the
way
i
be
certain
that
science
will
win
thank
you
albert
throughout
the
day
i
receive
many
phone
call
email
and
letter
of
thanks
as
do
my
colleague
each
of
these
communication
touch
me
whether
it
be
the
father
who
write
to
say
he
finally
felt
safe
for
his
kid
to
be
vaccinate
or
the
entrepreneur
who
express
awe
that
a
large
traditional
pharmaceutical
company
could
have
be
on
the
cut
edge
of
science
and
move
with
such
urgency
that
afternoon
i
do
several
interview
include
one
with
nbc
news
anchor
lester
holt
with
whom
i
have
spoken
many
time
over
the
previous
month
finally
that
even
i
go
home
and
have
a
moment
of
quiet
as
i
reflect
i
knew
that
two
truth
would
remain
with
me
forever
the
first
truth
be
that
our
breakthrough
vaccine
be
the
result
of
the
rare
combination
of
brilliant
cut
edge
science
power
by
the
private
sector
alongside
collaborative
engagement
with
government
it
s
fascinate
to
see
that
in
the
last
year
mrna
become
a
household
word
laypeople
follow
the
science
as
if
it
be
a
popular
sport
it
s
imperative
that
our
society
continue
to
respect
and
honor
science
to
me
the
woman
and
men
who
study
science
and
human
health
for
year
and
often
decade
and
have
devote
their
life
at
the
bench
or
scour
data
in
search
of
discovery
often
in
obscurity
be
hero
we
must
continue
to
treat
them
as
such
i
look
forward
to
the
day
when
schoolchildren
be
as
familiar
with
the
name
and
face
of
our
lead
scientist
as
they
be
with
celebrity
and
sport
star
i
m
a
true
believer
in
scientist
and
be
honor
to
have
five
outstanding
scientific
leader
on
the
pfizer
board
three
of
whom
i
have
recruit
to
pfizer
since
become
ceo
we
be
well
for
their
presence
around
our
board
table
i
revel
in
the
good
news
that
medical
school
application
be
on
the
rise
accord
to
the
american
association
of
medical
college
nearly
two
dozen
medical
school
have
see
application
jump
by
at
least
just
as
in
the
aftermath
of
many
young
american
chose
to
serve
their
country
today
s
graduate
be
select
career
in
science
and
medicine
in
response
to
the
pandemic
i
applaud
them
in
their
noble
pursuit
and
cannot
wait
to
see
what
they
achieve
science
will
win
become
our
mantra
across
pfizer
over
these
past
eighteen
month
we
emblazon
the
phrase
on
t
shirt
and
across
our
face
mask
plaster
it
on
the
outside
of
our
headquarters
and
sometimes
shout
it
at
the
end
of
our
lightspeed
meeting
i
m
go
to
insist
it
remain
our
rally
cry
let
us
always
remember
that
business
have
the
power
to
make
a
positive
difference
corporation
play
a
vital
role
as
engine
of
creativity
and
avenue
of
opportunity
commercial
pressure
require
businesspeople
to
quickly
discover
and
adapt
new
technology
and
boost
efficiency
and
productivity
entrepreneurship
and
innovation
go
hand
in
hand
i
sometimes
hear
young
people
speak
of
the
commercial
world
as
the
dark
side
i
be
young
once
so
i
understand
where
this
popular
misconception
come
from
my
three
decade
in
business
have
show
me
the
incredible
strength
and
force
for
good
that
a
well
resourced
soundly
lead
solution
base
company
can
be
that
s
why
i
left
academia
for
pfizer
and
i
ve
never
look
back
be
able
to
pull
the
powerful
lever
at
pfizer
to
move
quickly
and
independently
be
a
critical
factor
in
our
success
i
ll
continue
to
be
an
active
member
in
organization
like
the
business
roundtable
and
in
other
forum
where
i
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
my
fellow
business
leader
none
of
us
have
a
permanent
lease
on
the
corner
office
we
inhabit
we
must
always
stretch
our
think
on
how
we
can
contribute
to
the
great
good
we
must
demand
major
commitment
for
our
company
and
sacrifice
of
ourselves
especially
if
we
want
to
attract
top
talent
and
we
must
seek
pathway
for
collaboration
with
government
around
the
world
we
cannot
allow
extreme
partisanship
and
rancor
to
drive
us
to
bury
our
head
in
the
sand
i
ve
consider
it
a
great
privilege
when
i
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
the
elect
leader
from
all
political
party
and
government
around
the
world
i
be
never
annoyed
when
my
phone
rang
at
an
odd
hour
with
a
request
from
an
elect
leader
or
health
official
try
to
find
vaccine
for
their
people
as
i
ve
write
in
earlier
page
several
of
these
individual
be
now
friend
as
i
m
a
bit
of
a
political
and
history
enthusiast
i
admit
i
love
it
get
all
these
star
to
align
the
science
the
private
sector
and
the
government
be
the
formula
for
our
covid
success
and
an
imperative
to
resolve
other
crisis
in
the
future
the
second
truth
be
that
the
epic
approval
achieve
on
august
be
thanks
to
all
the
change
we
make
to
strengthen
pfizer
s
culture
in
the
year
lead
up
to
the
vaccine
before
we
knew
about
the
pandemic
it
be
not
only
the
focus
we
place
on
innovation
or
the
investment
we
make
in
increase
resource
for
digital
technology
and
research
yes
those
investment
be
important
but
the
most
impactful
change
be
the
cultivation
of
a
purpose
driven
culture
in
all
business
company
that
stay
true
to
their
purpose
perform
far
well
than
those
that
do
not
when
you
align
around
purpose
you
be
send
very
clear
guidance
to
an
organization
with
multiple
layer
that
clarity
brings
everyone
much
closer
to
what
need
to
be
do
and
improves
productivity
now
take
a
situation
like
ours
where
our
purpose
be
to
save
life
it
s
a
noble
one
that
add
passion
that
people
rally
around
this
culture
that
we
create
give
us
the
appropriate
mindset
and
allow
pfizer
to
move
with
the
agility
and
speed
of
a
small
biotech
and
bring
to
the
world
a
breakthrough
vaccine
that
be
dramatically
change
the
life
of
so
many
whether
you
be
a
leader
or
a
team
member
i
would
encourage
you
to
ask
yourself
the
follow
three
question
during
every
step
of
your
journey
be
i
be
true
to
my
purpose
have
i
aim
high
enough
do
i
have
the
right
mindset
every
member
of
our
team
answer
these
question
affirmatively
during
our
quest
to
make
the
impossible
possible
now
everyone
in
the
company
also
want
to
pursue
a
moonshot
for
their
area
of
human
health
we
dream
of
a
future
when
a
host
of
disease
will
someday
soon
become
preventable
or
treatable
all
of
us
share
an
impatience
especially
now
that
we
know
what
s
possible
i
could
go
on
and
like
so
many
of
us
at
pfizer
i
will
tell
these
story
for
the
rest
of
my
life
what
an
honor
it
have
be
to
be
able
to
work
so
purposefully
during
this
difficult
time
and
through
so
much
suffer
i
d
like
to
end
where
we
begin
with
the
eloquent
foreword
write
for
this
book
by
former
president
jimmy
carter
now
ninety
seven
he
s
accomplish
so
much
include
have
author
over
thirty
book
which
have
write
only
this
one
i
cannot
even
imagine
president
carter
serve
his
country
in
the
navy
and
then
become
a
successful
businessman
he
s
a
politician
who
achieve
the
high
office
of
the
us
and
be
a
true
humanitarian
and
philanthropist

found
the
carter

which
pfizer

with
to
provide
healthcare
to
the
most
vulnerable

volunteer
for
physical
labor
with
habitat
for
humanity
and
for
decade
taught
sunday
school
i
admire
him
and
take
inspiration
from
his
word
i
have
one
life
and
one
chance
to
make
it
count
for
something
my
faith

that
i
do
whatever
i
can
wherever

be
whenever
i
can
for
as
long
as
i
can
with
whatever
i
have
to
try
to
make
a
difference
i
couldn
t
agree
more
the
event
and
experience
in
the
book

as
i
have
remember
them
to
the
best
of
my
ability

ve
try
to
retell
my
conversation
in
a
way
that
evokes
the
real
feel
and
meaning
of
what
be

the
time

a
word
for
word

others
have
read
the
manuscript
and
to
the
extent
they
have
knowledge
have
confirm
its
accuracy
at
the
time
