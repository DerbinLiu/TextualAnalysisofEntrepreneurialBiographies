for
more
than
twenty

i
get
to
know
him
in
the
mid
ninety
when
i
be
ceo
of
microsoft
and
he
be
work
on
our
server
software
which
be
just
take
off
at
the
time
we
take
a
long
term
approach
to
building
the
business
which
have
two
benefit
it
give
the
company
another
growth
engine
and
it
foster
many
of
the
new
leader
who
run
microsoft
today
include
satya
later
i
work
really
intensely
with
him
when
he
move
over
to
run
our
effort
to
build
a
world
class
search
engine
we
have
fall
behind
google
and
our
original
search
team
have
move
on
satya
be
part
of
the
group
that
come
in
to
turn
thing
around
he
be
humble
forward
look
and
pragmatic
he
raise
smart
question
about
our
strategy
and
he
work
well
with
the
hard
core
engineer
so
it
be
no
surprise
to
me
that
once
satya
become
microsoft
s
ceo
he
immediately
put
his
mark
on
the
company
as
the
title
of
this
book
implies
he
didn
t
completely
break
with
the
past
when
you
hit
refresh
on
your
browser
some
of
what
s
on
the
page
stay
the
same
but
under
satya
s
leadership
microsoft
have
be
able
to
transition
away
from
a
purely
window
centric
approach
he
lead
the
adoption
of
a
bold
new
mission
for
the
company
he
be
part
of
a
constant
conversation
reach
out
to
customer
top
researcher
and
executive
and
most
crucially
he
be
make

bet
on
a
few
key
technology
like
artificial
intelligence
and
cloud
compute
where
microsoft
will
differentiate
itself
it
be
a
smart
approach

just
for
microsoft

bother
me

what
upset
me
more
be
that
our
own
people
just
accepted
it
sure
i
have
experienced
some
of
that
disharmony
in
my
various
role
but
i
never
saw
it
as
insolvable
so
when
i
be

i
told

priority
i
told
them
i

hungry
to

more

myself
when
steve
ballmer
be
ceo
and
while
i
admire
every
member
of
our
team
i
felt
that
we
need
to
deepen
our
understand
of
one
another
to
delve
into
what
really
make
each
of
us
tick
and
to
connect
our
personal
philosophy
to
our
job
as
leader
of
the
company
i
knew
that
if
we
drop
those
proverbial
gun
and
channel
that
collective
iq
and
energy
into
a
refresh
mission
we
could
get
back
to
the
dream
that
first
inspire
bill
and
paul
democratize
lead
edge
computer
technology
just
before
i
be
name
ceo
our
home
football
team
the
seattle
seahawks
have
just
won
the
super
bowl
and
many
of
us
found
inspiration
in
their
story
the
seahawks
coach
pete
carroll
have
caught
my
attention
with
the
hire
of
psychologist
michael
gervais
who
specializes
in
mindfulness
training
to
achieve
high
level
performance
it
may
sound
like
kumbaya
but
it
s
far
from
it
dr
gervais
work
with
the
seahawks
to
fully
engage
the
mind
of
player
and
coach
to
achieve
excellence
on
the
field
and
off
like
athlete
we
all
navigate
our
own
high
stake
environment
and
i
thought
our
team
could
learn
something
from
dr
gervais
s
approach
early
one
friday
morning
the
slt
assemble
only
this
time
it
be
not
in
our
staid
executive
boardroom
instead
we
gather
in
a
more
relaxed
space
on
the
far
side
of
campus
one
frequent
by
software
and
game
developer
it
be
open
airy
and
unpretentious
go
be
the
usual
table
and
chair
there
be
no
space
to
set
up
computer
to
monitor
never
end
email
and
newsfeeds
our
phone
be
put
away
jammed
into
pant
pocket
bag
and
backpack
instead
we
sat
on
comfortable
couch
in
a
large
circle
there
be
no
place
to
hide
i
open
the
meeting
by
ask
everyone
to
suspend
judgment
and
try
to
stay
in
the
moment
i
be
hopeful
but
i
be
also
somewhat
anxious
for
the
first
exercise
dr
gervais
ask
us
if
we
be
interested
in
have
an
extraordinary
individual
experience
we
all
nod
yes
then
he
move
on
and
ask
for
a
volunteer
to
stand
up
only
no
one
do
and
it
be
very
quiet
and
very
awkward
for
a
moment
then
our
cfo
amy
hood
jumped
up
to
volunteer
and
be
subsequently
challenged
to
recite
the
alphabet
intersperse
every
letter
with
a
number
a
b
c
and
so
forth
but
dr
gervais
be
curious
why
wouldn
t
everyone
jump
up
wasn
t
this
a
high
perform
group
didn
t
everyone
just
say
they
want
to
do
something
extraordinary
with
no
phone
or
pc
to
look
at
we
look
down
at
our
shoe
or
shot
a
nervous
smile
to
colleague
the
answer
be
hard
to
pull
out
even
though
they
be
just
beneath
the
surface
fear
of
be
ridicule
of
fail
of
not
look
like
the
smartest
person
in
the
room
and
arrogance
i
be
too
important
for
these
game
what
a
stupid
question
we
have
grown
use
to
hearing
but
dr
gervais
be
encourage
people
begin
to
breathe
more
easily
and
to
laugh
a
little
outside
the
grayness
of
the
morning
brighten
beneath
the
summer
sun
and
one
by
one
we
all
spoke
we
share
our
personal
passion
and
philosophy
we
be
ask
to
reflect
on
who
we
be
both
in
our
home
life
and
at
work
how
do
we
connect
our
work
persona
with
our
life
persona
people
talk
about
spirituality
their
catholic
root
their
study
of
confucian
teaching
they
share
their
struggle
as
parent
and
their
unending
dedication
to
make
product
that
people
love
to
use
for
work
and
entertainment
as
i
listen
i
realize
that
in
all
of
my
year
at
microsoft
this
be
the
first
time
i
d
heard
my
colleague
talk
about
themselves
not
exclusively
about
business
matter
look
around
the
room
i
even
saw
a
few
teary
eye
when
it
come
my
turn
i
drew
on
a
deep
well
of
emotion
and
begin
to
speak
i
have
be
think
about
my
life
my
parent
my
wife
and
child
my
work
it
have
be
a
long
journey
to
this
point
my
mind
go
back
to
earlier
day
as
a
child
in
india
as
a
young
man
immigrate
to
this
country
as
a
husband
and
the
father
of
a
child
with
special
need
as
an
engineer
design
technology
that
reach
billion
of
people
worldwide
and
yes
even
as
an
obsess
cricket
fan
who
long
ago
dream
of
be
a
professional
player
all
these
part
of
me
come
together
in
this
new
role
a
role
that
would
call
upon
all
of
my
passion
skill
and
value
just
as
our
challenge
would
call
upon
everyone
else
in
the
room
that
day
and
everyone
else
who
work
at
microsoft
i
told
them
that
we
spend
far
too
much
time
at
work
for
it
not
to
have
deep
meaning
if
we
can
connect
what
we
stand
for
as
individual
with
what
this
company
be
capable
of
there
be
very
little
we
can
t
accomplish
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
i
ve
always
have
a
hunger
to
learn
whether
it
be
from
a
line
of
poetry
from
a
conversation
with
a
friend
or
from
a
lesson
with
a
teacher
my
personal
philosophy
and
my
passion
developed
over
time
and
through
exposure
to
many
different
experience
be
to
connect
new
idea
with
a
grow
sense
of
empathy
for
other
people
idea
excite
me
empathy
ground
and
center
me
ironically
it
be
a
lack
of
empathy
that
nearly
cost
me
the
chance
to
join
microsoft
as
a
young
man
some
twenty
year
before
look
back
to
my
own
interview
process
decade
ago
i
remember
that
after
a
full
day
of
interview
with
various
engineering
leader
who
test
my
fortitude
and
my
intellectual
chop
i
met
richard
tait
an
up
and
come
manager
who
go
on
to
found
cranium
game
richard
didn
t
give
me
an
engineering
problem
to
solve
on
the
whiteboard
or
a
complex
cod
scenario
to
talk
through
he
didn
t
grill
me
on
my
prior
experience
or
educational
pedigree
he
have
one
simple
question
imagine
you
see
a
baby
lay
in
the
street
and
the
baby
be
cry
what
do
you
do
he
ask
you
call
i
reply
without
much
forethought
richard
walk
me
out
of
his
office
put
his
arm
around
me
and
say
you
need
some
empathy
man
if
a
baby
be
lay
on
a
street
cry
pick
up
the
baby
somehow
i
get
the
job
anyway
but
richard
s
word
have
remain
with
me
to
this
day
little
do
i
know
then
that
i
would
soon
learn
empathy
in
a
deeply
personal
way
it
be
just
a
few
short
year
later
that
our
first
child
zain
be
born
my
wife
anu
and
i
be
our
parent
only
child
and
so
you
can
imagine
there
have
be
much
anticipation
of
zain
s
birth
with
help
from
her
mom
anu
have
be
busily
equip
the
house
for
a
new
happy
and
healthy
baby
our
preoccupation
be
more
center
around
how
quickly
anu
might
return
to
her
burgeon
career
as
an
architect
from
maternity
leave
like
any
parent
we
thought
about
how
our
weekend
and
vacation
would
change
when
we
turn
parent
one
night
during
the
thirty
sixth
week
of
her
pregnancy
anu
notice
that
the
baby
be
not
move
as
much
as
she
be
accustom
to
so
we
go
to
the
emergency
room
of
a
local
hospital
in
bellevue
we
thought
it
would
be
just
a
routine
checkup
little
more
than
new
parent
anxiety
in
fact
i
distinctly
remember
feel
annoyed
by
the
wait
time
we
experienced
in
the
emergency
room
but
upon
examination
the
doctor
be
alarmed
enough
to
order
an
emergency
cesarean
section
zain
be
born
at
p
m
on
august
all
of
three
pound
he
do
not
cry
zain
be
transport
from
the
hospital
in
bellevue
across
lake
washington
to
seattle
child
s
hospital
with
its
state
of
the
art
neonatal
intensive
care
unit
anu
begin
her
recovery
from
the
difficult
birth
i
spent
the
night
with
her
in
the
hospital
and
immediately
go
to
see
zain
the
next
morning
little
do
i
know
then
how
profoundly
our
life
would
change
over
the
course
of
the
next
couple
of
year
we
learn
more
about
the
damage
cause
by
utero
asphyxiation
and
how
zain
would
require
a
wheelchair
and
be
reliant
on
us
because
of
severe
cerebral
palsy
i
be
devastate
but
mostly
i
be
sad
for
how
thing
turn
out
for
me
and
anu
thankfully
anu
help
me
to
understand
that
it
be
not
about
what
happen
to
me
it
be
about
deeply
understand
what
have
happen
to
zain
and
develop
empathy
for
his
pain
and
his
circumstance
while
accept
our
responsibility
as
his
parent
be
a
husband
and
a
father
have
take
me
on
an
emotional
journey
it
have
help
me
develop
a
deeper
understand
of
people
of
all
ability
and
of
what
love
and
human
ingenuity
can
accomplish
as
part
of
this
journey
i
also
discover
the
teaching
of
india
s
most
famous
son
gautama
buddha
i
be
not
particularly
religious
but
i
be
search
and
i
be
curious
why
so
few
people
in
india
have
be
follower
of
buddha
despite
his
origin
i
discover
buddha
do
not
set
out
to
found
a
world
religion
he
set
out
to
understand
why
one
suffers
i
learn
that
only
through
living
life
s
ups
and
down
can
you
develop
empathy
that
in
order
not
to
suffer
or
at
least
not
to
suffer
so
much
one
must
become
comfortable
with
impermanence
i
distinctly
remember
how
much
the
permanence
of
zain
s
condition
bother
me
in
the
early
year
of
his
life
however
thing
be
always
change
if
you
could
understand
impermanence
deeply
you
would
develop
more
equanimity
you
would
not
get
too
excite
about
either
the
ups
or
down
of
life
and
only
then
would
you
be
ready
to
develop
that
deeper
sense
of
empathy
and
compassion
for
everything
around
you
the
computer
scientist
in
me
love
this
compact
instruction
set
for
life
don
t
get
me
wrong
i
be
anything
but
perfect
and
for
sure
not
on
the
verge
of
achieve
enlightenment
or
nirvana
it
s
just
that
life
s
experience
have
help
me
build
a
grow
sense
of
empathy
for
an
ever

succeed
i
have
empathy
for
any

stark
realization
no
one
leader
no
one
group
and
no
one
ceo
would
be
the
hero
of
microsoft
s
renewal
if
there

a
renewal
it
would

of
our
company
driven
by
a
sense
of
empathy
and
a
desire
to
empower
others
but
most
important
it
s
about
the
change
come
in
every
life
as
we
witness
the
most
transformative
wave
of
technology
yet
one
that
will
include
artificial
intelligence
mixed
reality
and
quantum
compute
it
s
about
how
people
organization
and
society
can
and
must
transform
hit
refresh
in
their
persistent
quest
for
new
energy
new
idea
relevance
and
renewal
at
the
core
it
s
about
us
human
and
the
unique
quality
we
call
empathy
which
will
become
ever
more
valuable
in
a
world
where
the
torrent
of
technology

the
mystical
austrian
poet
rainer
maria
rilke
once
write
that
the
future
enters
into
us
in
order
to
transform
itself
in
us
long
before
it
happens
as
much
as
elegant
computer
code
for
machine
existential
poetry
can
illuminate
and
instruct
us
speak
to
us
from
another
century
rilke
be
say
that
what
lie
ahead
be
very
much
within
us
determine
by
the
course
each
of

take
today
that
course
those
decision
be
what
i
ve
set
out
to
describe
in
these
page
you
will
follow
three
distinct
storyline
first
as
prologue
i
ll
share
my
own
transformation
move
from
india
to
my
new
home
in
america
with
stop
in
the
heartland
in
silicon
valley
and
at
a
microsoft
then
in
its
ascendancy
part
two
focus
on
hit
refresh
at
microsoft
as
the
unlikely
ceo
who
succeed
bill
gate
and
steve
ballmer
microsoft
s
transformation
under
my
leadership
be
not
complete
but
i
be
proud
of
our
progress
in
the
third
and
final
act
i
ll
take
up
the
argument
that
a
fourth
industrial
revolution
lie
ahead
one
in
which
machine
intelligence
will
rival
that
of
human
we
ll
explore
some
heady
question
what
will
the
role
of
human
become
will
inequality
resolve
or
worsen
how
can
government
help
what
be
the
role
of
multinational
corporation
and
their
leader
how
will
we
hit
refresh
as
a
society
i
be
excite
to
write
this
book
but
also
a
little
reluctant
who
really
care
about
my
journey
with
only
a
few
year
under
my
belt
as
microsoft
s
ceo
it
felt
premature
to
write
about
how
we
ve
succeed
or
fail
on
my
watch
we
ve
make
a
lot
of
progress
since
that
slt
meeting
but
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
that
s
also
why
i
m
not
interested
in
write
a
memoir
i
ll
save
that
for
my
dotage
but
several
argument
convince
me
to
carve
out
a
little
time
at
this
stage
of
my
life
to
write
i
felt
the
tug
of
responsibility
to
tell
our
story
from
my
perspective
it
s
also
a
time
of
enormous
social
and
economic
disruption
accelerate
by
technological
breakthrough
the
combination
of
cloud
compute
sensor
big
data
machine
learn
and
artificial
intelligence
ai
mixed
reality
and
robotics
foreshadows
socioeconomic
change
ripped
from
the
page
of
science
fiction
there
be
a
wide
and
grow
spectrum
of
debate
about
the
implication
of
this
come
wave
of
intelligent
technology
on
the
one
hand
pixar
s

a
portrait
of
eternal
relaxation
for
human
who
rely
on
robot
for
the
hard
work
but
on
the
other
scientist
like
stephen
hawk
warn
of
doom
the
most
compelling
argument
be
to
write
for
my
colleague
microsoft
s
employee
and
for
our
million
of
customer
and
partner
after
all
on
that
cold
february
day
in
when
microsoft
s
board
of
director
announce
that
i
would
become

i
put
the
company
s
culture
at
the
top
of
our

i
say
that
we
need
to
rediscover
the
soul
of

our
reason
for

i
have
come
to
understand

my
primary

in

what
if
we
could
share
the
journey
together
the
meditation
of
a
sit

in
the
midst
of
a
massive
transformation
microsoft
s
root
its
original
raison

be
to
democratize
compute
to
make
it
accessible
to
everyone
a
computer
on
every

and
in
every

be
our
original
mission
it
define
our

but
much
have
change
most
every
desk
and
home
now
have
a
computer
and
most
people
have
a

we
have
succeed
in
many
way
but
we
also
be
lag
in
too
many
other
way
pc
sale
have
slow
and
we
be
significantly
behind
in
mobile
we
be
behind
in
search
and
we
need
to
grow
again
in
game
we
need
to
build
deeper
empathy
for
our
customer
and
their
unarticulated
and
unmet
need
it
be
time
to
hit
refresh
after
twenty
two
year
as
an
engineer
and
a
leader
at
microsoft
i
have
be
more
philosophical
than
anxious
about
the
search
process
for
a
new
ceo
even
with
speculation
swirl
about
who
would
succeed
steve
quite
frankly
my
wife
anu
and
i
largely
ignore
the
rumor
at
home
we
be
just
too
busy
with
take
care
of
zain
and
our
two
daughter
at
work
i
be
very
focus
on
continue
to
grow
a
highly
competitive
business
the
microsoft
cloud
my
attitude
be
that
the
board
would
select
the
best
person
it
would
be
great
if
it
be
me
but
i
would
also
be
equally
happy
work
for
someone
the
board
have
confidence
in
in
fact
as
part
of
the
interview
process
one
of
the
board
member
suggest
that
if
i
want
to
be
ceo
i
need
to
be
clear
that
i
be
hungry
for
the
job
i
thought
about
this
and
even
talk
to
steve
he
laugh
and
simply
say
it
s
too
late
to
be
different
it
just
wouldn
t
be
me
to
display
that
kind
of
personal
ambition
when
john
thompson
who
at
that
time
be
the
lead
independent
director
and
head
the
ceo
search
sent
me
an
email
on
january
ask
for
time
to
chat
i
be
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
i
thought
he
probably
be
go
to
give
me
an
update
on
where
the
board
be
in
its
decision
process
and
so
when
john
call
that
even
he
first
ask
me
if
i
be
sit
down
i
be
not
in
fact
i
be
calmly
play
with
a
kookaburra
cricket
ball
as
i
usually
do
when
talk
on
the
speakerphone
at
work
he
go
on
to
deliver
the
news
that
i
be
to
become
the
new
ceo
of
microsoft
it
take
a
couple
of
minute
to
digest
his
message
i
say
that
i
be
honor
humble
and
excite
they
be
unplanned
word
but
they
perfectly
capture
how
i
felt
week
later
i
told
medium
outlet
that
we
need
to
focus
more
clearly
move
faster
and
continue
to
transform
our
culture
and
business
but
behind
the
scene
i
knew
that
to
lead
effectively
i
need
to
get
some
thing
square
in
my
own
mind
and
ultimately
in
the
mind
of
everyone
who
work
at
microsoft
why
do
microsoft
exist
and
why
do
i
exist
in
this
new
role
these
be
question
everyone
in
every
organization
should
ask
themselves
i
worried
that
fail
to
ask
these
question
and
truly
answer
them
risk
perpetuate
earlier
mistake
and
bad
not
be
honest
every
person
organization
and
even
society
reach
a
point
at
which
they
owe
it
to
themselves
to
hit
refresh
to
reenergize
renew
reframe
and
rethink
their
purpose
if
only
it
be
as
easy
as
punch
that
little
refresh
button
on
your
browser
sure
in
this
age
of
continuous
update
and
always
on
technology
hit
refresh
may
sound
quaint
but
still
when
it
s
do
right
when
people
and
culture
re
create
and
refresh
a
renaissance
can
be
the
result
sport
franchise
do

it
one
day
ascend
company
like
facebook
will
stop
grow
and
they
will
have
to
do
it
too
and
so
let
me
start
at
the
begin
my
own
story
i
mean
what
kind
of
ceo
asks
such
existential
question
as
why
do
we
exist
in
the
first
place
why
be
concept
like
culture
idea
and
empathy
so
important
to
me
well
my
father
be
a
civil
servant
with
marxist
leaning
and
my
mother
be
a
sanskrit
scholar
while
there
be
much
i
learn
from
my
father
include
intellectual
curiosity
and
a
love
of
history
i
be
always
my
mother
s
son
she
care
deeply
about
my
be
happy
confident
and
living
in
the
moment
without
regret
she
work
hard
both
at
home
and
in
the
college
classroom
where
she
taught
the
ancient
language
literature
and
philosophy
of
india
and
she
create
a
home
full
of
joy
even
so
my
early
memory
be
of
my
mom
struggle
to
continue
her
profession
and
to
make
the
marriage
work
she
be
the
constant
steady
force
in
my
life
and
my
father
be
large
than
life
he
nearly
immigrate
to
the
united
state
a
faraway
place
that
represent
opportunity
on
a
fulbright
fellowship
to
pursue
a
phd
in
economics
but
those
plan
be
suddenly
and
understandably
shelve
when
he
be
select
to
join
the
indian
administrative
service
ia
it
be
early
s
and
jawaharlal
nehru
be
india
s
first
prime
minister

gandhi
s
historic
movement
which
have
achieve
independence
from
great
britain
for
that
generation
enter
the
civil
service
and
be
part
of
the
birth
of
a
new
nation
be
a
true
dream
come
true
the
ia
be
essentially
a
remnant
of
the
old
raj
system
left
by
the
british
to
govern
after
the
uk
turn
over
control
of
the
country
in
only
about
a
hundred
young
professional
per
year
be
select
for
the
ia
and
so
at
a
very
young
age
my
father
be
administer
a
district
with
million
of
people
throughout
my
childhood
he
be
post
in
many
district
across
the
state
of
andhra
pradesh
in
india
i
remember
move
from
place
to
place
grow
up
in
the
sixty
and
early
seventy
in
old
colonial
building
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
with
lot
of
time
and
space
and
in
a
country
be
transform
my
mom
do
her
level
best
during
all
these
disruption
to
maintain
her
teach
career
raise
me
and
be
a
love
wife
when
i
be
about
six
my
five
month
old
sister
die
it
have
a
huge
impact
on
me
and
our
family
mom
have
to
give
up
work
after
that
i
think
my
sister
s
death
be
the
last
straw
lose
her
combine
with
raise
me
and
work
to
maintain
a
career
while
my
father
be
work
in
faraway
place
be
just
too
much
she
never
complain
to
me
at
all
about
it
but
i
reflect
on
her
story
quite
a
bit
especially
in
the
context
of
today
s
diversity
conversation
across
the
technology
industry
like
anyone
she
want
to
and
deserve
to
have
it
all
but
the
culture
of
her
workplace
couple
with
the
social
norm
of
indian
society
at
the
time
didn
t
make
it
possible
for
her
to
balance
family
life
with
her
professional
passion
among
the
child
of
ia
father
it
be
a
rat
race
for
some
of
the
ia
dad
simply
passing
the
grueling
entrance
test
meant
they
be
set
for
life
it
be
the
last
test
they
would
ever
have
to
take
but
my
father
believe
passing
the
ia
exam
be
merely
the
entry
point
to
be
able
to
take
even
more
important
exam
he
be
a
quintessential
lifelong
learner
but
unlike
most
of
my
peer
at
that
time
whose
high
achieve
parent
apply
tremendous
pressure
to
achieve
i
didn
t
face
any
of
that
my
mom
be
just
the
opposite
of
a
tiger
mom
she
never
pressure
me
to
do
anything
other
than
just
be
happy
that
suit
me
just
fine
as
a
kid
i
couldn
t
have
care
less
about
pretty
much
anything
except
for
the
sport
of
cricket
one
time
my
father
hung
a
poster
of
karl
marx
in
my
bedroom
in
response
my
mother
hung
one
of
lakshmi
the
indian
goddess
of
plentitude
and
contentment
their
contrast
message
be
clear
my
father
want
intellectual
ambition
for
me
while
my
mother
want
me
to
be
happy
versus
be
captive
to
any
dogma
my
reaction
the
only
poster
i
really
want
be
one
of
my
cricket
hero
the
hyderabadi
great
m
l
jaisimha
famous
for
his
boyish
good
look
and
graceful
style
on
and
off
the
field
look
back
i
have
be
influence
by
both
my
father
s
enthusiasm
for
intellectual
engagement
and
my
mother
s
dream
of
a
balance
life
for
me
and
even
today
cricket
remains
my
passion
nowhere
be
the
intensity
for
cricket
great
than
in
india
even
if
the
game
be
invent
in

i
be
good
enough
to
play
for
my
school
in
hyderabad
a
place
that
have
a
lot
of
cricket
tradition
and
zeal
i
be
an
off
spin
bowler
which
in
baseball
would
be
the
equivalent
to
a
pitcher
with
a
sharp
break
curveball
cricket
attracts
an
estimate
billion
fan
globally
compare
with
just
half
a
billion
baseball
fan
both
be
beautiful
sport
with
passionate
fan
and
a
body
of
literature
brimming
with
the
grace
excitement
and
complexity
of
competition
in
his
novel
netherland
joseph
o
neill
describes
the
beauty
of
the
game
its
eleven
player
converge
in
unison
toward
the
batsman
and
then
return
again
and
again
to
their
start
point
a
repetition
or
pulmonary
rhythm
as
if
the
field
breathe
through
its
luminous
visitor
i
think
of
that
metaphor
of
the
cricket
team
now
as
a
ceo
when
reflect
on
the
culture
we
need
in

have
remain
with

push
academic
if
you
like
to
study
physic
you
study

if
you
felt
like
oh
science
be
too
boring
and
you
want
to
study
history
you
study
history
there
wasn
t
that
intense
peer
pressure
to
follow
a
particular
path
after
a
few
year
at
hp
my
dad
go
to
work
at
the
united
nation
in
bangkok
he
wasn
t
too
fond
of
my
laid
back
attitude
he
say
i
m
go
to
pull
you
out
and
you
should
come
do
your
eleventh
and
twelfth
in
some
international
school
in
bangkok
i
say
no
chance
and
so
i
just
stuck
to
hyderabad
everybody
be
think
be
you
crazy
why
would
you
do
that
but
there
be
no
way
i
be
leave
cricket
be
a
major
part
of
my
life
at
that
time
attend
that
school
give
me
some
of
my
great
memory
and
a
lot
of
confidence
by
twelfth
grade
if
you
have
ask
me
about
my
dream
it
be
to
attend
a
small
college
play
cricket
for
hyderabad
and
eventually
work
for
a
bank
that
be
it
be
an
engineer
and
go
to
the
west
never
occur
to
me
my
mom
be
happy
with
those
plan
that
s
fantastic
son
but
my
dad
really
force
the
issue
he
say
look
you
ve
get
to
get
out
of
hyderabad
otherwise
you
ll
ruin
yourself
it
be
good
advice
then
but
few
could
predict
that
hyderabad
would
become
the
technological
hub
it
be
today
it
be
hard
to
break
from
my
circle
of
friend
but
dad
be
right
i
be
be
provincial
with
my
ambition
i
need
some
perspective
cricket
be
my
passion
but
computer
be
a
close
second
when
i
be
fifteen
my
father
brought
me
a
sinclair
zx
spectrum
computer
kit
from
bangkok
its
z
cpu
have
be
developed
in
the
mid
seventy
by
an
engineer
who
left
intel
where
he
have
be
work
on
the
microprocessor
which
ironically
be
the
chip
bill
gate
and
paul
allen
use
to
write
the
original
version
of
microsoft
basic
the
zx
spectrum
inspire
me
to
think
about
software
engineering
and
even
the
idea
that
personal
compute
technology
could
be
democratize
if
a
kid
in
nowhere
india
could
learn
to
program
surely
anyone
could
i
flunk
the
indian
institute
of
technology
iit
entrance
exam
the
holy
grail
of
all
thing
academic
for
middle
class
kid
grow
up
in
india
at
that
time
my
father
who
never
met
an
entrance
test
he
do
not
pas
be
more
amuse
than
annoyed
but
luckily
i
have
two
other
option
to
pursue
engineering
i
have
gotten
into
mechanical
engineering
at
birla
institute
of
technology
in
mesra
and
electrical
engineering
ee
at
manipal
institute
of
technology
i
chose
manipal
base
on
a
hunch
that
pursue
ee
be
go
to
get
me
closer
to
computer
and
software
and
fortuitously
the
hunch
be
right
academically
it
put
me
on
a
pathway
that
would
lead
to
silicon
valley
and
eventually
to
microsoft
the
friend
i
make
in
college
be
entrepreneurial
driven
and
ambitious
i
learn
from
many
of
them
in
fact
year
later
i
rent
a
house
in
sunnyvale
california
with
eight
of
my
classmate
from
manipal
and
re
create
our
dorm
room
experience
from
college
athletically
though
manipal
left
a
lot
to
be
desire
play
cricket
be
no
longer
my
central
passion
i
played
one
match
for
my
college
team
and
hung
up
my
gear
computer
take
cricket
s
place
and
become
number
one
in
my
life
at
manipal
i
train
in
microelectronics
integrate
circuit
and
the
first
principle
of
make
computer
i
didn
t
really
have
a
specific
plan
for
what
i
d
do
after
finish
my
electrical
engineering
degree
there
be
much
to
be
say
for
my
mother
s
philosophy
of
life
which
influence
how
i
thought
about
my
own
future
and
opportunity
she
always
believe
in
do
your
thing
and
at
your
pace
pace
come
when
you
do
your
thing
so
long
as
you
enjoy
it
do
it
mindfully
and
well
and
have
an
honest
purpose
behind
it
life
won
t
fail
you
that
have
stood
me
in
good
stead
all
my
life
after
graduation
i
have
an
opportunity
to
attend
a
prestigious
industrial
engineering
institute
in
bombay
i
have
also
apply
to
a
few
college
in
the
united
state
in
those
day
the
student
visa
be
bit
of
a
crapshoot
and
frankly
i
be
hop
it
would
be
reject
i
never
want
to
leave
india
but
as
fate
would
have
it
i
get
my
visa
and
be
again
face
with
some
choice
whether
to
stay
in
india
and
do
a
master
s
degree
in
industrial
engineering
or
go
to
the
university
of
wisconsin
at
milwaukee
for
a
master
s
degree
in
electrical
engineering
a
very
dear
friend
from
hp
be
attend
wisconsin
study
computer
science
and
so
my
decision
be
make
i
enter
the
master
s
in
computer
science
program
at
wisconsin
and
i
m
glad
i
do
because
it
be
a
small
department
with
professor
who
be
invest
in
their
student
i
m
particularly
thankful
to
then
department
chair
dr
vairavan
and
my
master
s
advisor
professor
hosseini
for
instill
in
me
the
confidence
not
to
pursue
what
be
easy
but
to
tackle
the
big
and
hardest
problem
in
computer
science
if
someone
have
ask
me
to
point
to
milwaukee
on
a
map
i
could
not
have
do
it
but
on
my
twenty
first
birthday
in
i
flew
from
new
delhi
to
chicago
o
hare
airport
from
there
a
friend
drove
me
to
campus
and
drop
me
off
what
i
remember
be
the
quiet
everything
be
quiet
milwaukee
be
just
stun
pristine
i
thought
god
this
place
be
heaven
on
earth
it
be
summer
it
be
beautiful
and
my
life
in
the
united
state
be
just
begin
summer
become
winter
and
the
cold
of
wisconsin
be
something
to
behold
if
you
ve
come
from
southern
india
i
be
a
smoker
at
the
time
and
all
smoker
have
to
stand
outside
there
be
a
number
of
us
from
various
part
of
the
world
the
indian
student
couldn
t
stand
the
cold
so
we
quit
smoking
then
my
chinese
friend
quit
but
the
russian
be
unaffected
by
winter
s
chill
and
they
just
kept
on
puff
away
sure
i
would
get
homesick
like
any
kid
but
america
could
not
have
be
more
welcome
i
don
t
think
my
story
would
be
possible
anywhere
else
and
i
be
proud
today
to
call
myself
an
american
citizen
look
back
though
i
suppose
my
story
may
sound
a
little
programmatic
the
son
of
an
indian
civil
servant
study
hard
get
an
engineering
degree
immigrates
to
the
united
state
and
make
it
in
tech
but
it
wasn
t
that
simple
unlike
the
stereotype
i
be
actually
not
academically
that
great
i
didn
t
go
to
the
elite
indian
institute
of
technology
iits
that
have
become
synonymous
with
building
silicon
valley
only
in
america
would
someone
like
me
get
the
chance
to
prove
himself
rather
than
be
typecast
base
on
the
school
i
attend
i
suppose
that
be
true
for
earlier
wave
of
immigration
as
well
and
will
be
just
as
true
for
new
generation
of
immigrant
like
many
others
it
be
my
great
fortune
to
benefit
from
the
convergence
of
several
tectonic
movement
india
s
independence
from
british
rule
the
american
civil
right
movement
which
change
immigration
policy
in
the
united
state
and
the
global
tech
boom
indian
independence
lead
to
large
investment
in
education
for
indian
citizen
like
me
in
the
united
state
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
abolish
the
nation
of
origin
quota
and
make
it
possible
for
skilled
worker
to
come
to
america
and
contribute
before
that
only
about
a
hundred
indian
be
allow
to
immigrate
each
year
write
for
the
new
york
time
on
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
immigration
act
historian
ted
widmer
note
that
nearly
million
people
come
to
the
united
state
as
a
result
of
the
act
but
the
influx
be
not
unrestrained
the
act
create
preference
for
those
with
technical
training
and
those
with
family
member
already
in
the
state
unknowingly
i
be
the
recipient
of
this
great
gift
these
movement
enable
me
to
show
up
in
the
united
state
with
software
skill
just
before
the
tech
boom
of
the
s
talk
about
hit
the
lottery
during
the
first
semester
at
wisconsin
i
take
image
processing
a
computer
architecture
class
and
lisp
one
of
the
old
computer
program
language
the
first
set
of
assignment
be
just
huge
program
project
i
d
write
a
little
bit
of
code
but
i
be
not
a
proficient
coder
by
any
stretch
i
know
the
stereotype
in
america
be
that
the
indian
who
immigrate
be
born
to
code
but
we
all
start
somewhere
the
assignment
be
basically
here
it
be
go
write
a
bunch
of
code
it
be
tough
and
i
have
to
pick
it
up
quickly
once
i
do
it
be
awesome
i
understood
pretty
early
on
that
the
microcomputer
be
go
to
shape
the
world
initially
i
thought
it
might
be
all
about
building
chip
most
of
my
college
friend
all
go
on
to
specialize
in
chip
design
and
work
at
place
with
real
impact
like
mentor
graphic
synopsys
and
juniper
i
become
particularly
interested
in
a
theoretical
aspect
of
computer
science
that
be
at
its
heart
design
to
make
fast
decision
in
an
atmosphere
of
great
uncertainty
and
finite
time
my
focus
be
a
computer
science
puzzle
know
as
graph
color
no
i
wasn
t
color
graph
with
crayon
graph
color
be
part
of
computational
complexity
theory
in
which
you
must
assign
label
traditionally
call
color
to
element
of
a
graph
within
certain
constraint
think
of
it
this
way
imagine
color
the
u
s
map
so
that
no
state
share
a
common
border
receives
the
same
color
what
be
the
minimal
number
of
color
you
would
need
to
accomplish
this
task
my
master
s
thesis
be
about
develop
the
best
heuristic
to
accomplish
complex
graph
color
in
nondeterministic
polynomial
time
or
np
complete
in
other
word
how
can
i
solve
a
problem
that
have
limitless
possibility
in
a
way
that
be
fast
and
good
but
not
always
optimal
do
we
solve
this
as
best
we
can
right
now
or
work
forever
for
the
best
solution
theoretical
computer
science
really
grabbed
me
because
it
show
the
limit
to
what
today
s
computer
can
do
it
lead
me
to
become
fascinate
by
mathematician
and
computer
scientist
john
von
neumann
and
alan
turing
and
by
quantum
compute
which
i
will
write
about
later
as
we
look
ahead
to
artificial
intelligence
and
machine
learn
and
if
you
think
about
it
this
be
great
training
for
a
ceo
nimbly
manage
within
constraint
i
complete
my
master
s
in
computer
science
at
wisconsin
and
even
manage
to
work
for
what
microsoft
would
now
call
an
independent
software
vendor
isv
i
be
building
apps
for
oracle
database
while
finish
my
master
s
thesis
i
be
good
at
relational
algebra
and
become
proficient
with
database
and
structure
query
language
sql
program
this
be
the
era
where
technology
be
change
from
character
or
text
mode
on
unix
workstation
to
graphical
user
interface
like
window
it
be
early
and
i
didn
t
even
really
think
about
microsoft
at
that
time
because
we
never
use
pc
my
focus
be
on
more
powerful
workstation
in
fact
i
left
milwaukee
in
for
my
first
job
in
silicon
valley
at
sun
microsystems
sun
be
the
king
of
workstation
a
market
microsoft
have
in
its
crosshairs
sun
have
an
amaze
collection
of
talent
include
its
founder
scott
mcnealy
and
bill
joy
as
well
as
james
gosling
the
inventor
of

and
eric
schmidt
our
vp
for
software
development
who
go
on
to
run
novell
and
then
google
my
two
year
at
sun
be
a
time
of
great
transition
in
the
computer
business
as
sun
look
longingly
at
microsoft
s
window
graphical
user
interface
and
microsoft
look
longingly
at
sun
s
beautiful
powerful
bit
workstation
and
operating
system
again
i
happen
to
be
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
sun
ask
me
to
work
on
desktop
software
like
their
email
tool
i
be
later
sent
to
cambridge
massachusetts
to
work
for
several
month
with
lotus
to
port
their
spreadsheet
software
to
sun
workstation
then
i
start
to
notice
something
alarm
every
couple
of
month
sun
want
to
adopt
a
new
graphical
user
interface
gui
strategy
that
meant
i
have
to
rework
my
program
constantly
and
their
explanation
make
less
and
less
sense
i
realize
that
despite
its
phenomenal
leadership
and
capability
it
have
a
hard
time
building
and
stick
with
a
cogent
software
strategy
by
i
be
again
at
a
crossroad
in
my
life
i
want
to
work
on

a

about
a
switch
to
investment
banking
i
have
gotten
into
the
full
time
program
at
university
of
chicago
but
teper
say
you
should
just
join

straightaway
i
decide
to
do
both
i
be
able
to
switch
my
admission
to
the

zonis
and
many
other

be
year
before

for
all
of
this
amaze
broadband
infrastructure
that
make
our
vod
pilot
possible
so
in
long
before
it
be
commercially

i
have
video
on

while
sit
in
my
little
apartment
we
only
have
about
fifteen
movie
but
i
remember
watch

over
a
fully
switch
asynchronous
transfer
mode
atm
network
to
the
home
we
saw
our
idea

obsolete
virtually
overnight
with

np
complete
question

family
value
that
the
united
state
stood
for
the
combination
of
his
persuasiveness
and
the
kindness
of
the
u

return
to

and
college
to
complete
her
degree
it
be
now
clear
to
us
that
anu
s
return
to
the
united
state
would
be
very
difficult
give
the

waitlist
for

microsoft
have
an
immigration

five
or
more
year

the
country
under
exist

i
contemplate
quit
microsoft

that

nothing
i
could
do
about
it
anu
be
my
priority
and
that
make
my
decision
a
simple
one
i
go
back
to
the
u
s
embassy
in
delhi
in
june
of
past
the
enormous
line
of
people

told
a

his
head
and

next
morning

good
in
seattle
where
we
would
start
a
family
and
build
a
life
together
what
i
didn
t
expect
be
the
instant
notoriety
around
campus
hey
there
go
the
guy
who
give
up
his
green
card
every
other
day
someone
would
call
me
and
ask
for
advice
much
later
one
of
my
colleague
kunal
bahl
do
quit
microsoft
when
his
h
b

out
and
his
green

and
then
found
snapdeal
which
today
be
worth
more
than
billion
and
employ
five
thousand
people
ironically
online
cloud
base
company
like
snapdeal
would
play
an
important
role
in
my
future
and
that
of
microsoft
and
the
lesson
i
learn
in
my
former
country
continue
to
shape
my
present
chapter
learn
to
lead
see
the
cloud
through
our
window
i
be
obsess
with
cricket
no
matter
where
i
be
this
beautiful
game
be
always
in
the
back
of
my
mind
the
joy
the
memory
the
drama
the
complexity
and
the
ups
and
down
the
infinite
possibility
for
those
of
you
unfamiliar
with
cricket
it
be
an
international
sport
played
on
a
large
green
oval
in
the
summer
and
early
fall
its
popularity
be
strong
among
the
current
and
former
nation
of
the
british
commonwealth
like
baseball
in
cricket
a
ball
be
hurl
at
a
batter
who
endeavor
to
strike
the
ball
and
score
as
many
run
as
possible
the
pitcher
be
a
bowler
the
batter
be
a
batsman
the
diamond
be
a
wicket
and
the
fielder
try
to
get
the
batsman
out
yes
there
be
form
of
a
match
that
can
stretch
on
for
day
but
then
in
baseball
team
compete
to
win
and
even
game
series
both
sport
be
endlessly
complex
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
team
with
the
most
run
win
this
be
not
the
book
to
describe
the
in
and
out
of
cricket
but
it
be
a
book
that
cannot
avoid
the
metaphor
of
cricket
and
business
like
most
south
asian
i
somehow
fell
in
love
with
this
most
english
of
game
on
the
dusty
mat
wicket
of
the
deccan
plateau
in
southern
india
there
on
those
field
i
learn
a
lot
about
myself
succeed
and
fail
as
a
bowler
a
batsman
and
a
fielder
even
today
i
catch
myself
reflect
on
the
nuance
within
the
cricket
rulebook
and
the
inherent
grace
of
a
team
of
eleven
work
together
as
one
unit
during
the
early
year
of
my
life
when
my
father
s
work
as
a
civil
servant
take
us
to
the
district
headquarters
of
andhra
pradesh
and
the
hill
of
mussoorie
in
what
be
now
uttarakhand
cricket
be
not
the
phenomenon
it
be
now
today
the
indian
premier
league
sell
its
ten
year
television
right
for
billion
but
back
then
it
become
a
phenomenon
for
me
when
at
the
age
of
eight
we
move
to
hyderabad
we
stayed
in
a
rent
house
in
the
somajiguda
neighborhood
and
our
landlord

ali
be
a
gracious
and
proud
hyderabadi
who
wore
his
osmania
university
cricket
cap
while
work
in
his
auto
shop

be
full
of
story
about
all

first
time

much
of
an
impression
even
though
they
beat
hyderabad
handily
i
be
in
awe
of
m

presence
his
fashionable
upturned
collar
and
distinctive
gait

when

return
to
hyderabad
and
for
the
next
six
year
i
truly
and
surely
fell
in
love
with
cricket
as
a
player
for
hyderabad
public
school
hp
in
fact
mr
jaisimha

as
a
result
we
be
surround
by
cricket
glamour
tradition
and
obsession
in
those
day
everyone
be
talk
about
the
two
india
school
player
from
hp
one
of
them
be
saad
bin
jung
who
also
happen
to
be
the
famous
indian
cricket
captain
tiger
pataudi
s
nephew
still
in
school
he
go
on
to
smash
a
hundred
run
against
a
tour
west
indian
side
while
play
for
south
zone
represent
our
region
of
southern
india
i
begin
play
on
the
b
team
and
graduate
to
the
senior
team
which
played
in
the
a
league
of
hyderabad
we
be
the
only
school
team
to
play
in
the
a
league
as
the
other
team
be
sponsor
by
bank
and
miscellaneous
company
ranji
trophy
player
would
turn
up
in
these
league
game
and
all
that
intrigue
make
for
intense
competition
what
excite
me
then
about
cricket
be
what
still
excites
me
today
even
living
in
a
non
cricket
country
though
the
united
state
over
a
hundred
year
ago
do
periodically
host
australian
and
english
side
cricket
for
me
be
like
a
wondrous
russian
novel
with
plot
and
subplots
played
out
over
the
course
of
multiple
act
in
the
end
one
brilliant
knock
or
three
deftly
bowl
ball
can
change
the
complexion
of
a
game
there
be
three
story
from
my
all
too
brief
cricket
past
that
speak
very
directly
to
business
and
leadership
principle
i
use
even
today
as
a
ceo
the
first
principle
be
to
compete
vigorously
and
with
passion
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
and
intimidation
in
my
school
cricket
day
we
played
a
team
one
summer
that
have
several
australian
player
during
the
match
our
pe
teacher
who
act
as
a
sort
of
general
manager
for
the
team
notice
that
we
be
admire
the
aussie
play
in
fact
we
be
more
than
a
little
intimidate
by
them
we
have
never
played
against
foreign
player
and
australia
of
course
loom
large
in
the
national
cricket
psyche
i
now
recognize
our
teacher
and
general
manager
as
very
much
like
an
american
football
coach
loud
and
very
competitive
he
be
have
none
of
our
admiration
and
intimidation
he
begin
by
yell
at
the
captain
to
get
more
aggressive
i
be
a
bowler
and
a
terrible
fielder
but
he
position
me
at
forward
short
leg
right
beside
the
powerful
australian
batsman
i
would
have
be
happy
stand
far
away
but
he
put
me
right
next
to
the
action
in
time
with
new
energy
and
new
focus
we
transform
into
a
competitive
team
it
show
me
that
you
must
always
have
respect
for
your
competitor
but
don
t
be
in
awe
go
and
compete
on
reflection
a
second
principle
be
simply
the
importance
of
put
your
team
first
ahead
of
your
personal
statistic
and
recognition
one
of
my
team
have
a
brilliant
fast
bowler
he
be
one
of
the
most
promising
young
cricketer
in
the
land
he
become
even
great
after
attend
a
u
south
zone
coach
clinic
his
pace
and
accuracy
be
just
brilliant
as
a
tail
end
batsman
myself
be
in
the
net
similar
to
baseball
batting
cage
against
this
guy
be
tough
but
he
have
a
self
destructive
mindset
during
one
game
our
captain
decide
to
replace
him
with
another
bowler
soon
the
new
bowler
coaxed
the
oppose
batsman
to
mi
hit
a
ball
skyward
an
easy
catch
for
our
cantankerous
teammate
now
at
mid
off
a
fielding
position
twenty
five
to
thirty
yard
from
the
batsman
rather
than
take
a
simple
catch
he
plunge
both
hand
deep
into
his
pocket
and
watch
passively
as
the
ball
fell
right
in
front
of
him
he
be
a
star
player
and
we
look
on
in
complete
disbelief
the
lesson
one
brilliant
character
who
do
not
put
team
first
can
destroy
the
entire
team
there
be
of
course
many
lesson
and
principle
one
can
take
from
cricket
but
for
me
a
third
be
the
central
importance
of
leadership
look
back
i
remember
one
particular
match
in
which
my
off
spin
bowling
be
get
hammer
by
the
opponent
i
be
serve
up
very
ordinary
stuff
our
team
captain
in
retrospect
show
me
what
real
leadership
look
like
when
my
over
have
end
that
be
when
i
have
thrown
six
ball
he
replace
me
with
himself
even
though
he
be
a
well
batsman
than
bowler
he
quickly
take
the
wicket
the
batsman
be
out
customarily
take
a
wicket
that
efficiently
would
argue
for
him
remain
in
as
a
bowler
but
instead
he
immediately
hand
the
ball
back
to
me
and
i
take
seven
wicket
of
my
own
why
do
he
do
it
i
surmise
he
want
me
to
get
my
confidence
back
it
be
early
in
the
season
and
he
need
me
to
be
effective
all
year
he
be
an
empathetic
leader
and
he
knew
that
if
i
lose
my
confidence
it
would
be
hard
to
get
it
back
that
be
what
leadership
be
about
it
s
about
bring
out
the
best
in
everyone
it
be
a
subtle
important
leadership
lesson
about
when
to
intervene
and
when
to
build
the
confidence
of
an
individual
and
a
team
i
think
that
be
perhaps
the
number
one
thing
that
leader
have
to
do
to
bolster
the
confidence
of
the
people
you
re
lead
that
team
captain
go
on
to
play
many
year
of

saw
thing
differently
i
notice
just
how
many
of
the

ran
on

how
they
be
increasingly
connect

that
be
now
a
fundamental
part
of
the

application
we
take
for
grant
today
it
be
a
stark
reminder
that
our
work
at
microsoft
transcend
business
that
it
make
life
itself
possible
for
a
fragile
young

it
also
brought
a

we
d
well

to
myself
my
son

require
that
i
draw
daily
upon
the
very
same
passion
for

empathy
that
i
learn
from
my
parent
and
i
do
this
both
at

at

whether
i
be

become
the
governor
of
north
dakota
doug
be
an
inspirational
leader
who
mentor
me
to
become
a
more
complete
leader
he
thought
about
business
and
work
not
in
isolation
but
as
part
of
a
broader
societal
fabric
and
a
core
part
of
one
s
life
some
of
the
lesson
i
learn
from
doug
be
today
an
important
part
of
who
i
be
as
a
leader
lead
the
dynamic
team
be
a
dream
job
for
the
first
time
i
be
get
the
chance
to
run
a
business
end
to
end
i
have
spent
nearly
five
year
prepare
for
this
job
i
have
all
the
relationship
inside
and
outside
microsoft
to
drive
the
dynamic
business
forward
but
steve
s
offer
be
essentially
push
me
out
of
my
comfort
zone
i
d
never
work
in
a
consumer
face
business
and
have
not
really
tracked
microsoft
s
search
engine
effort
or
our
early
attempt
to
build
cloud
infrastructure
so
one
night
after
a
long
day
at
work
i
decide
to
drive
over
to
building
which
house
the
internet
search
engineering
team
i
want
to
walk
the
hallway
and
see
who
these
people
be
how
else
could
i
empathize
with
the
team
i
be
be
ask
to
lead
it
be
about
p
m
but
the
parking
lot
be
packed
i
d
expect
to
see
a
few
straggler
finish
up
their
day
but
no
the
whole
team
be
there
work
at
their
desk
and
eat
take
out
food
i
didn
t
really
talk
to
anyone
but
what
i
observe
cause
me
to
wonder
what
get
people
to
work
like
this
something
important
must
be
happen
in
building
see
the
team
that
night
their
commitment
and
dedication
clinched
it
for
me
i
told
steve
okay
i
m
in
what
color
be
my
parachute
i
didn
t
have
one
i
be
enter
a
new
world
and
the
move
prove
to
be
fortuitous
little
do
i
know
it
would
be
my
prove
ground
for
future
leadership
and
the
future
of
the
company
very
quickly
i
realize
we
would
need
four
essential
skill
to
build
an
online
cloud
base
business
that
would
be
access
primarily
from
mobile
phone
rather
than
desktop
computer
first
i
thought
i
knew
a
lot
about
distribute
compute
system
but
suddenly
i
realize
i
have
to
completely
relearn
these
system
because
of
the
cloud
a
distribute
system
simply
put
be
how
software
communicates
and
coordinate
across
networked
computer
imagine
hundred
of
thousand
of
people
type
in
search
query
at
the
same
time
if
those
query
land
in
just
one
server
somewhere
in
a
room
on
the
west
coast
it
would
break
that
server
but
now
imagine
those
query
be
distribute
evenly
across
a
network
of
server
the
vast
array
of
compute
power
would
enable
delivery
of
instant
relevant
result
to
the
consumer
and
if
there
s
more
traffic
just
add
more
server
this
elasticity
be
a
core
attribute
of
cloud
compute
architecture
second
we
have
to
become
great
at
consumer
product
design
we
knew
we
need
great
technology
but
we
also
understood
we
need
a
great
experience
one
you
want
to
engage
with
time
and
again
traditional
software
design
mapped
out
what
developer
thought
a
product
should
look
like
in
a
year
s
time
when
it
would
finally
go
to
market
modern
software
design
involves
online
product
update
through
continuous
experimentation
designer
offer
web
page
in
flight
so
an
old
version
of
bing
be
deliver
to
some
searcher
while
an
untested
new
version
reach
others
user
scorecard
determine
which
be
the
most
effective
sometimes
seemingly
tiny
difference
can
mean
a
lot
something
as
simple
as
the
color
or
size
of
a
type
font
may
profoundly
impact
the
willingness
of
consumer
to
engage
trigger
behavioral
variation
that
may
be
worth
ten
of
million
in
revenue
now
microsoft
have
to
master
this
new
approach
to
product
design
third
we
have
to
be
great
at
understand
and
building
two
side
market
the
economics
of
a
new
online
business
on
one
side
be
the
consumer
who
go
online
for
search
result
and
on
the
other
side
be
the
advertiser
who
want
their
business
to
be
found
both
be
need
to
succeed
this
creates
the
auction
effect
i
be
describe
earlier
both
side
of
the
business
be
equally
important
and
design
the
experience
for
both
side
be
crucial
attract
more
and
more
searcher
obviously
make
it
easy
to
attract
more
and
more
advertiser
and
show
the
right
advertisement
be
crucial
to
deliver
relevant
result
so
bootstrapping
the
online
auction
and
improve
search
result
relevance
would
prove
to
be
a
vital
challenge
finally
we
need
to
be
great
at
apply
machine
learn
ml
ml
be
a
very
rich
form
of
data
analytics
that
be
foundational
to
artificial
intelligence
we
need
a
sophisticated
understand
of
how
to
do
two
thing
at
once
discern
the
intent
of
someone
search
the
web
and
then
match
that
intent
with
accurate
knowledge
gain
from
crawl
the
web
ingest
and
understand
information
ultimately
bing
would
prove
to
be
a
great
training
ground
for
building
the
hyper
scale
cloud
first
service
that
today
permeate
microsoft
we
weren
t
just
building
bing
we
be
building
the
foundational
technology
that
would
fuel
microsoft
s
future
building
bing
taught
us
about
scale
experimentation
lead
design
apply
ml
and
auction
base
pricing
these
skill
be
not
only
mission
critical
at
our
company
but
highly
sought
after
throughout
today
s
technology
universe
but
we
start
very
much
behind
in
search
we
have
yet
to
launch
a
product
that
could
compete
with
google
so
i
hit
the
road
meeting
with
executive
from
facebook
amazon
yahoo
and
apple
to
evangelize
our
emerge
search
engine
i
want
to
make
deal
but
i
also
want
to
learn
more
about
how
they
engineer
their
product
to
stay
fresh
i
found
that
the
key
be
agility
agility
agility
we
need
to
develop
speed
nimbleness
and
athleticism
to
get
the
consumer
experience
right
not
just
once
but
daily
we
need
to
set
and
repeatedly
meet
short
term
goal
shipping
code
at
a
more
modern
fast
pace
cadence
to
accomplish
this
we
need
to
periodically
gather
all
of
the
decision
maker
in
a
war
room
set
in
september
i
call
together
the
search
engineer
for
the
first
of
these
meeting
which
we
casually
call
search
checkpoint
perhaps
we
should
have
be
more
creative
with
the
name
because
it
have
stuck
and
now
we
re
at
a
checkpoint
in
the
many
hundred
we
have
decide
to
launch
bing
in
june
a
new
search
engine
and
a
new
brand
i
learn
a
lot
about
create
urgency
and
mobilize
leader
with
different
skill
and
background
toward
one
common
goal
in
what
be
a
new
area
for
microsoft
i
realize
that
in
a
successful
company
it
be
as
important
to
unlearn
some
old
habit
as
it
be
to
learn
new
skill
my
learn
during
this
time
be
greatly
accelerate
by
the
hire
of
dr
qi
lu
as
head
of
all
online
service
at
microsoft
qi
have
be
an
executive
at
yahoo
and
be
intensely
recruit
throughout
silicon
valley
steve
harry
shum
today
our
head
of
ai
and
research
and
i
have
go
down
to
the
bay
area
to
spend
an
afternoon
talk
to
qi
on
the
flight
back
steve
say
to
me
we
should
get
him
but
if
you
don
t
want
to
work
for
him
that
will
be
a
problem
have
just
met
with
qi
i
knew
that
he
be
someone
from
whom
i
could
learn
a
lot
and
microsoft
could
benefit
so
i
do
not
hesitate
in
support
the
hire
of
qi
to
microsoft
even
though
in
some
sense
it
be
stall
my
own
promotion
i
realize
that
my
own
professional
growth
would
come
from
work
for
and
learn
from
qi
during
my
time
in
our
online
business
later
qi
would
become
an
important
member
of
my
senior
leadership
team
during
the
first
few
year
i
be
ceo
qi
eventually
left
the
company
but
he
continue
to
be
a
trust
friend
and
advisor
over
time
yahoo
integrate
bing
as
its
search
engine
and
together
we
power
a
quarter
of
all
u
s
search
the
search
engine
that
many
have
say
should
be
shutter
in
its
early
day
of
struggle
continued
to
win
an
expand
share
of
the
market
and
today
it
be
a
profitable
multi
billion
dollar
business
for
microsoft
just
as
important
though
be
how
it
help
to
jump
start
our
move
to
the
cloud
as
be
so
often
the
case
at
microsoft
there
be
other
experiment
elsewhere
in
the
company
aim
at
the
same
problem
lead
to
internal
competition
and
even
fiefdom
since
ray
ozzie
have
be
incubate
a
highly
secretive
cloud
infrastructure
product
with
the
code
name
red
dog
a
longtime
microsoft
reporter
mary
jo
foley
come
across
a
job
advertisement
for
a
red
dog
engineer
and
write
a
piece
speculate
that
this
project
must
be
microsoft
s
answer
to
amazon
s
aws
at
some
point
during
my
time
at
bing
i
met
with
the
red
dog
team
to
explore
how
we
might
work
together
i
quickly
realize
that
microsoft
s
storied
server
and
tool
business
stb
where
product
like
window
server
and
sql
server
have
be
invent
and
built
and
where
red
dog
be
house
be
world
apart
from
bing
stb
be
microsoft
s
third
large
group
by
revenue
after
office
and
window
they
be
the
deep
distribute
system
expert
but
when
i
contrast
stb
with
bing
a
few
thing
be
apparent
they
lack
the
feedback
loop
that
come
from
run
an
at
scale
cloud
service
i
realize
that
they
be
caught
up
in
the
local
maximum
of
service
their
exist
customer
base
and
be
not
learn
fast
enough
about
the
new
world
of
cloud
service
and
the
red
dog
team
be
a
side
effort
that
be
ignore
by
the
mainstream
of
the
stb
leadership
and
organization
in
late
ray
ozzie
announce
in
a
long
internal
memo
that
he
be
leave
microsoft
he
write
in
his
departure
email
the
one
irrefutable
truth
be
that
in
any
large
organization
any
transformation
that
be
to
stick
must
come
from
within
while
red
dog
be
still
in
incubation
and
have
book
little
revenue
he
be
correct
that
the
transformation
of
microsoft
would
come
from
within
steve
have
already
proclaim
that
the
company
be
all
in
on
the
cloud
have
invest
billion
in
research
and
development
much
of
it
focus
on
cloud
technology
but
even
though
engineer
be
work
on
cloud
related
technology
a
clear
vision
of
a
microsoft
cloud
platform
have
not
yet
surface
to
say
nothing
of
a
real
world
revenue
stream
right
around
that
time
steve
ask
that
i
lead
stb
which
today
have
evolve
into
microsoft
s
cloud
and
enterprise
business
i
be
give
this
news
of
my
new
role
not
even
a
week
before
i
get
the
job
steve
have
a
sense
that
we
need
to
move
faster
to
the
cloud
he
have
personally
and
aggressively
driven
the
transformation
of
our
office
business
to
the
cloud
he
want
us
to
be
equally
bold
when
it
come
to
cloud
infrastructure
when
i
take
over
our
fledgling
cloud
business
in
january
analyst
estimate
that
cloud
revenue
be
already
multi
billion
of
dollar
with
amazon
in
the
lead
and
microsoft
nowhere
to
be
see
meanwhile
revenue
from
our
cloud
service
could
be
count
in
the
million
not
the
billion
although
amazon
do
not
report
its
aws
revenue
in
those
day
they
be
the
clear
leader
building
a
huge
business
without
any
real
challenge
from
microsoft
in
his
annual
letter
to
shareholder
in
april
just
as
i
be
begin
my
new
role

the

and
we
have
not
even
muster
our
troop
year
earlier
i
have
left
sun
microsystems
to
help
microsoft
capture
the
lead
in
the
enterprise
market
and
here
we
be
once
again
far
behind
as
a
company
we
d
be
very
publicly
miss
the
mobile
revolution
but
we
be
not
about
to
miss
the
cloud
i
would
miss
work
with
colleague
at
bing
but
i
be
excite
to
lead
what
i
sense
would
be
the
big
transformation
of
microsoft
in
a
generation
our
journey
to
the
cloud
i
have
spent
three
year
from
to
learn
the
cloud
pressure
test
its
infrastructure
operation
and
economics
but
as
a
user
not
as
a
provider
of
the
cloud
that
experience
would
enable
me
to
execute
with
speed
in
my
new
role
but
it
wouldn
t
be
easy
the
server
and
tool
business
be
at
the
peak
of
its
commercial
success
and
yet
it
be
miss
the
future
the
organization
be
deeply
divide
over
the
importance
of
the
cloud
business
there
be
constant
tension
between
diverge
force
on
the
one
hand
the
division
s
leader
would
say
yes
there
be
this
cloud
thing
and
yes
we
should
incubate
it
but
on
the
other
hand
they
would
quickly
shift
to
warn
remember
we
ve
get
to
focus
on
our
server
business
the
server
that
have
make
stb
a
force
within
microsoft
and
the
industry
namely
window
server
and
sql
server
be
now
hold
them
back
discourage
them
from
innovate
and
grow
with
the
time
shortly
after
i
take
over
the
company
issue
this
statement
nadella
and
his
team
be
tasked
with
lead
microsoft
s
enterprise
transformation
into
the
cloud
and
provide
the
technology
roadmap
and
vision
for
the
future
of
business
compute
steve
have
say
the
transformation
would
not
happen
overnight
but
we
be
run
out
of
time
i
have
a
very
good
idea
about
where
we
need
to
go
but
i
realize
that
my
real
task
be
to
motivate
the
pride
and
desire
in
the
stb
leader
to
go
there
with
me
sure
i
have
a
point
of
view
but
i
also
recognize
this
be
a
team
that
care
deeply
about
enterprise
those
customer
with
exact
and
sophisticated
compute
need
i
want
to
build
on
their
institutional
knowledge
and
so
i
set
out
first
to
learn
from
the
team
i
be
to
lead
and
hopefully
to
earn
the
team
s
respect
only
then
could
we
go
boldly
together
to
a
new
and
well
place
leadership
mean
make
choice
and
then
rally
the
team
around
those
choice
one
thing
i
have
learn
from
my
dad
s
experience
as
a
senior
indian
government
official
be
that
few
task
be
more
difficult
than
building
a
last
institution
the
choice
of
lead
through
consensus
versus
fiat
be
a
false
one
any
institution
building
come
from
have
a
clear
vision
and
culture
that
work
to
motivate
progress
both
top
down
and
bottom
up
in
business
school
i
have
read
young
men
and
fire
a
book
by
norman
maclean
best
know
for
a
river
run
through
it
it
tell
the
story
of
a
tragic
forest
fire
that
kill
thirteen
smokejumpers
parachute
firefighter
in
and
the
investigation
that
follow
what
i
remember
be
the
lesson
that
go
unheeded
the
urgent
need
to
build
share
context
trust
and
credibility
with
your
team
the
lead
firefighter
who
ultimately
escape
the
blaze
knew
that
he
have
to
build
a
small
fire
in
order
to
escape
the
big
fire
but
no
one
would
follow
him
he
have
the
skill
to
get
his
men
out
of
harm
s
way
but
he
hadn
t
built
the
share
context
need
to
make
his
leadership
effective
his
team
paid
the
ultimate
price
i
be
determine
not
to
make
the
same
mistake
like
that
lead
firefighter
i
have
to
convince
my
team
to
adapt
a
counterintuitive
strategy
to
shift
focus
from
the
big
server
and
tool
business
that
paid
everyone
s
salary
to
the
tiny
cloud
business
with
almost
no
revenue
to
win
their
support
i
need
to
build
share
context
i
decide
not
to
bring
my
old
team
from
bing
with
me
it
be
important
that
the
transformation
come
from
within
from
the
core
it
s
the
only
way
to
make
change
sustainable
the
team
i
inherit
be
more
like
a
group
of
individual
the
poet
john
donne
write
no
man
be
an
island
but
he
d
feel
otherwise
have
he
join
our
meeting
each
leader
in
the
group
be
in
essence
ceo
of
a
self
sustain
business
each
live
and
operate
in
a
silo
and
most
have
be
do
so
for
a
very
long
time
my
portfolio
have
no
center
of
gravity
and
to
make
matter
bad
many
thought
they
should
have
gotten
my
job
their
attitude
be
one
of
frustration
they
be
make
all
this
money
and
now
this
little
squeaky
thing
call
the
cloud
come
along
and
they
didn
t
want
to
bother
with
it
to
break
out
of
this
impasse
i
met
with
everyone
on
the
stb
leadership
team
individually
take
their
pulse
ask
question
and
listen
together
we
have
to
see
that
our
north
star
would
be
a
cloud
first
strategy
our
product
and
technology
would
optimize
for
the
cloud
not
just
for
private
server
that
reside
on
an
organization
s
own
premise
though
we
would
be
cloud
first
our
server
strength
would
enable
us
to
differentiate
ourselves
as
the
company
that
deliver
a
hybrid
solution
to
customer
who
want
both
private
on
premise
server
and
access
to
the
public
cloud
this
new
framework
help
reshape
the
argument
break
down
the
resistance
to
go
all
in
on
the
cloud
i
begin
to
notice
a
new
openness
to
innovation
and
a
search
for
creative
way
to
meet
the
need
of
our
commercial
customer
unfortunately
red
dog
which
have
become
window
azure
be
still
struggle
they
be
try
to
leapfrog
with
a
new
approach
to
cloud
compute
but
the
market
be
clearly
give
them
feedback
that
they
first
need
to
meet
their
current
need
mark
russinovich
who
be
an
early
member
of
the
red
dog
team
and
the
current
cto
of
azure
have
a
clear
road
map
in
mind
to
evolve
azure
we
need
to
infuse
more
resource
into
the
team
to
execute
on
that
road
map
it
be
time
to
move
azure
into
the
mainstream
of
stb
rather
than
have
it
be
a
side
project
people
the
human
element
of
any
enterprise
be
ultimately
the
great
asset
and
so
i
set
about
assemble
the
right
team

in
his

he
set
about
building
the
new

that
be

on
create

to
measure
consumption
of
cloud
service
and
invent
new
way
to
package
our
product
for
customer
one
of
the
early
decision
i
make
be
to
differentiate
azure
with
our
data
and
ai
capability
raghu
and
team
design
and
built
the
data
platform
that
could
help
store
and
process
exabyte
scale
data
microsoft
be
develop
machine
learn
and
ai
capability
as
part
of
our
product
such
as
bing
xbox
kinect
and
skype
translator
i
want
us
to
make
this
capability
available
to
third
party
developer
as
part
of
azure
a
key
hire
for
azure
be
joseph
sirosh
who
i
recruit
from
amazon
joseph
have
be
passionately
work
in
ml
for
all
his
professional
career
and
he
brought
that
passion
to
his
new
role
at
microsoft
now
our
cloud
not
only
could
store
and
compute
massive
amount
of
data
it
could
also
analyze
and
learn
from
the
data
the
practical
value
of
ml
be
immense
and
incredibly
varied
take
a
microsoft
customer
like
thyssenkrupp
a
manufacturer
in
the
elevator
and
escalator
business
use
azure
and
azure
ml
they
can
now
predict
in
advance
when
an
elevator
or
escalator
will
need
maintenance
virtually
eliminate
outage
and
create
new
value
for
its
customer
similarly
an
insurer
like
metlife
can
spin
up
our
cloud
with
ml
overnight
to
run
enormous
actuarial
table
and
have
answer
to
its
most
crucial
financial
question
in
the
morning
make
it
possible
for
the
company
to
adapt
quickly
to
dramatic
shift
in
the
insurance
landscape
an
unexpected
flu
epidemic
a
more
violent
than
normal
hurricane
season
whether
you
be
in
ethiopia
or
evanston
ohio
or
if
you
hold
a
doctorate
in
data
science
or
not
everyone
should
have
that
capability
to
learn
from
the
data
with
azure
microsoft
would
democratize
machine
learn
just
as
it
have
do
with
personal
compute
back
in
the
s
to
me
meeting
with
customer
and
learn
from
both
their
articulate
and
unarticulated
need
be
key
to
any
product
innovation
agenda
in
my
meeting
with
customer
i
would
usually
bring
other
leader
and
engineer
along
so
that
we
could
learn
together
on
one
trip
to
the
bay
area
we
met
with
several
startup
it
become
clear
that
we
need
to
support
the
linux
operating
system
and
we
have
already
take
some
rudimentary
step
toward
that
with
azure
but
as
scott
guthrie
and
our
team
walk
out
of
those
meeting
that
day
it
be
certain
that
we
need
to
make
first
class
support
for
linux
in
azure
we
make
that
decision
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
parking
lot
this
may
sound
like
a
purely
technical
dilemma
but
it
also
pose
a
profound
cultural
challenge
dogma
at
microsoft
have
long
held
that
the
open
source
software
from
linux
be
the
enemy
we
couldn
t
afford
to
cling
to
that
attitude
any
longer
we
have
to
meet
the
customer
where
they
be
and
more
importantly
we
need
to
ensure
that
we
view
our
opportunity
not
through
a
rearview
mirror
but
with
a
more
future
orient
perspective
we
change
the
name
of
the
product
from
window
azure
to
microsoft
azure
to
make
it
clear
that
our
cloud
be
not
just
about
window
to
scale
our
cloud
business
we
not
only
need
to
build
the
right
technology
but
we
need
to
run
a
service
to
meet
the
exact
need
of
some
of
the
world
s
large
customer
we
be
already
run
at
scale
service
such
as
bing
office
and
xbox
live
but
with
azure
we
be
now
power
thousand
of
other
business
every
minute
of
every
day
our
team
have
to
learn
to
embrace
what
i
call
live
site
first
culture
the
operational
culture
be
as
important
as
any
key
technology
breakthrough
we
would
have
on
a
single
skype
call
dozen
of
engineer
plus
our
customer
face
field
team
all
of
whom
would
swarm
together
to
coordinate
and
fix
any
problem
and
every
such
incident
would
lead
to
rigorous
root
cause
analysis
so
that
we
could
continuously
learn
and
improve
i
would
from
time
to
time
join
these
call
to
see
our
engineer
in
action
the
key
be
to
not
have
the
top
leader
infuse
fear
or
panic
but
to
help
foster
the
action
that
fix
the
issue
at
hand
and
the
learn
from
it
today
microsoft
be
on
course
to
have
its
own
billion
cloud
business
we
have
look
beyond
the
package
product
that
have
make
microsoft
one
of
the
most
valuable
company
in
the
world
to
see
great
opportunity
in
our
cloud
platform

taught
me
a
series
of
lesson
i
would
carry
with
me
for
year
to
come
perhaps
the
most
important
be
this
a
leader
must
see
the
external
opportunity
and
the
internal
capability
and
culture
and
all
of
the
connection
among
them
and
respond
to
them
before
they
become
obvious
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
it
s
an
art
form
not
a
science
and
a
leader
will
not
always
get
it
right
but
the
batting
average
for
how
well
a
leader
do
this
be
go
to
define
his
or
her
longevity
in
business
it
s
an
insight
that
would
serve
me
well
when
an
even
big
set
of
challenge
be
present
to
me
as

me
to
dell
in
texas
and
hewlett

the

like
and
where
to
get

the
next

that
he
would
retire
just
after
he
have
lead
a
major
reorganization
of
the
company
and
on
the
eve
of
announce
the
billion
deal
with
the
finnish
smartphone
manufacturer
nokia
throughout
the
fall
reporter
routinely
speculate
about
who
would
be
name
as
his
replacement
would
it
be
an
outsider
like
ford
motor
company
s
ceo
alan
mulally
or
the
executive
of
a
microsoft
acquisition
like
tony
bates
of
skype
or
stephen
elop
of
nokia
several
of
us
be
ask
to
put
our
idea
on
paper
for
the
board
of
director
as
a
sort
of
audition
for
the
job
in
my
memo
to
the
board
i
d
drawn
on
more
than
twenty
year
of
experience
inside
the
company
but
i
d
also
drawn
on
something
steve
ballmer
the
depart
ceo
told
me
he
encourage
me
to
be
my
own
man
in
other
word
don
t
try
to
please
bill
gate
or
anyone
else
be
bold
be
right
he
told
me
bill
and
paul
allen
found
microsoft
bill
and
steve
built
microsoft
as
founder
bill
have
famously
recruit
steve
out
of
stanford
business
school
in
to
become
his
first
business
manager
steve
the
passionate
leader
salesman
and
marketer
and
bill
the
technology
visionary
whose
voracious
reading
and
think
week
kept
microsoft
ahead
of
envious
competitor
together
they
form
one
of
the
most
iconic
business
partnership
in
history
a
pioneer
in
compute
that
would
make
microsoft
the
most
valuable
company
on
the
planet
not
only
do
they
build
great
product
but
they
shape
hundred
of
executive
who
today
run
global
business
everywhere
include
me
they
have
give
me
more
and
more
responsibility
over
the
year
and
taught
me
that
our
software
can
impact
not
just
the
life
of
computer
hobbyist
but
entire
society
and
economy
despite
my
devotion
to
what
they
have
built
steve
didn
t
want
me
to
be
confuse
he
be
invite
me
to
throw
dogma
out
the
window
he
knew
more
than
anyone
that
the
company
have
to
change
and
he
selflessly
step
out
of
his
role
as
ceo
to
ensure
the
change
happen
in
a
deep
way
as
a
consummate
insider
i
be
be
told
to
start
anew
to
refresh
the
browser
and
load
a
new
page
the
next
page
in
microsoft
s
history
and
so
my
memo
to
the
board
call
for
a
renewal
of
microsoft
it
would
require
embrace
more
ubiquitous
compute
and
ambient
intelligence
this
mean
human
will
interact
with
experience
that
span
a
multitude
of
device
and
sens
all
these
experience
will
be
power
by
intelligence
in
the
cloud
and
also
at
the
edge
where
data
be
be
generate
and
interaction
with
people
be
take
place
but
this
renewal
would
only
happen
i
write
if
we
prioritize
the
organization
s
culture
and
built
confidence
both
inside
and
outside
the
company
it
would
be
only
too
easy
to
continue
to
live
off
our
past
success
we
have
be
like
king
albeit
now
in
a
threaten
kingdom
there
be
way
to
cash
cow
this
business
and
drive
short
term
return
but
i
believe
we
could
build
long
term
value
by
be
true
to
our
identity
and
innovate
i
pull
into
a
parking
space
outside
studio
d
home
of
our
xbox
development
team
this
part
of
the
campus
didn
t
even
exist
when
i
start
at
microsoft
in
and
yet
now
it
be
surround
by
several
dozen
low
slung
office
building
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
over
the
next
hour
studio
d
s
glassy
three
story
atrium
would
fill
with
employee
invite
to
an
all
company
meeting
and
webcast
i
knew
they
be
hopeful
but
also
skeptical
one
have
only
to
look
at
a
few
industry
chart
to
see
why
after
decade
of
steady
growth
in
worldwide
pc
shipment
sale
have
peaked
and
be
now
in
decline
quarterly
pc
shipment
be
now
around
million
while
smartphone
shipment
be
reach
over
million
this
be
bad
news
for
microsoft
every
pc
sell
meant
a
royalty
payment
to
microsoft
to
make
matter
bad
not
only
be
pc
sale
soft
but
so
be
interest
in
window
launch
eighteen
month
earlier
meanwhile
android
and
apple
operating
system
be
surge
reflection
of
the
smartphone
explosion
that
we
at
microsoft
have
fail
to
lead
and
barely
manage
to
participate
in
as
a
result
microsoft
s
stock
long
a
blue
chip
investment
have
be
tread
water
for
year
internally
the
story
be
equally
dire
that
year
our
annual
employee
poll
reveal
that
most
employee
didn
t
think
we
be
head
in
the
right
direction
and
question
our
ability
to
innovate
to
bring
this

behind
despite
their
grand
plan
and
great
idea
they
come
to
microsoft
with
big
dream
but
it
felt
like
all
they
really
do
be
deal
with
upper
management
execute
tax
process
and
bicker
in
meeting
they
believe
that
only
an
outsider
could
get
the
company
back
on
track
none

spar
on
how
to
inspire
this
dishearten
group
of
brilliant
people
in
some
way
i

i
knew
it
must
start
from
within
a
few
minute
later
i
stood
onstage
for
a
photo
that
would
soon
go

and
me
the
only

forty
year
history
the

wooed
by
competitor

of
all
many
felt
the
company
be
lose
its
soul
steve
kick
thing
off
with
a
move
and
encourage
speech
bill
spoke
next
his
dry
sense
of
humor
immediately
present
survey
the
room
he
feign
surprise
at
what
a
large
market
share
window
phone
enjoy
in
this
room
then
he
get
down
to
business
bill
succinctly
capture
the
challenge
and
the
opportunity
that
lay
ahead
microsoft
be
found
base
on
a
belief
in
the
magic
of
software
and
i
d
say
that
opportunity
today
be
strong
than
it
s
ever
be
the
magic
of
what
we
can
do
for
people
at
work
and
at
home
with
our
software
be
totally
in
front
of
us
we
ve
get
some
amaze
strength
with
the
window
platform
the
thing
we
re
do
in
the
cloud
with
office
and
we
ve
get
some
challenge
there
be
a
lot
of
people
out
there
on
the
cloud
do
interest
thing
there
s
a
lot
of
mobile
activity
which
we
ve
get
a
slice
of
but
not
as
big
a
slice
as
we
need
to
have
then
he
call
me
forward
when
the
applause
subside
i
waste
no
time
in
call
my
colleague
and
teammate
to
action
our
industry
do
not
respect
tradition
what
it
respect
be
innovation
it
s
our
collective
challenge
to
make
microsoft
thrive
in
a
mobile
first
and
a
cloud
first
world
if
there
be
any
one
theme
i
want
to
emphasize
that
day
it
be
that
we
must
discover
what
would
be
lose
in
the
world
if
microsoft
just
disappear
we
have
to
answer
for
ourselves
what
be
the
company
about
why
do
we
exist
i
told
them
it
be
time
for
us
to
rediscover
our
soul
what
make
us
unique
one
of
my
favorite
book
be
tracy
kidder
s
the
soul
of
a
new
machine
about
another
tech
company
data
general
in
the
s
in
it
kidder
teach
us
that
technology
be
nothing
more
than
the
collective
soul
of
those
who
build
it
the
technology
be
fascinate
but
even
more
fascinate
be
the
profound
obsession
of
its
designer
and
so
what
be
soul
in
this
context
of
a
company
i
don
t
mean
soul
in
a
religious
sense
it
be
the
thing
that
come
most
naturally
it
be
the
inner
voice
it
s
what
motivates
and
provide
inner
direction
to
apply
your
capability
what
be
the
unique
sensibility
that
we
as
a
company
have
for
microsoft
that
soul
be
about
empower
people
and
not
just
individual
but
also
the
institution
they
build
enterprise
like
school
hospital
business
government
agency
and
nonprofit
steve
job
understood
what
the
soul
of
a
company
be
he
once
say
that
design
be
the
fundamental
soul
of
a
man
make
creation
that
end
up
express
itself
in
successive
outer
layer
of
the
product
or
service
i
agree
apple
will
always
remain
true
to
its
soul
as
long
as
its
inner
voice
its
motivation
be
about
great
design
for
consumer
product
the
soul
of
our
company
be
different
i
knew
that
microsoft
need
to
regain
its
soul
as
the
company
that
make
powerful
technology
accessible
to
everyone
and
every
organization
democratize
technology
when
i
first
wore
hololens
microsoft
s
holographic
computer
i
thought
about
how
it
might
be
use
by
large
enterprise
for
design
and
in
school
and
hospital
not
just
how
much
fun
play
minecraft
will
be
it
s
not
that
we
have
lose
our
soul
but
we
need
renewal
a
renaissance
in
the
s
bill
and
paul
allen
start
microsoft
with
the
goal
of
help
to
put
a
computer
on
every
desk
and
in
every
home
that
be
a
bold
inspire
and
audacious
ambition
one
they
accomplish
democratize
and
personalize
technology
how
many
organization
can
say
they
achieve
their
found
mission
there
be
no
way
i
would
become
ceo
of
a
fortune
company
if
it
be
not
for
the
democratize
force
of
microsoft
all
over
the
world
but
the
world
have
change
and
it
be
time
for
us
to
change
our
view
of
the
world
worldview
be
an
interest
term
root
in
cognitive
philosophy
simply
put
it
be
how
a
person
comprehensively
see
the
world
across
political
social
and
economic
border
what
be
the
common
experience
we
all
share
the
question
i
have
be
ask
before
become
ceo
why
do
we
exist
force
me
to
change
my
tech
worldview
and
similarly
now
every
leader
at
microsoft
be
change
theirs
as
well
we
no
longer
live
in
a
pc
centric
world
compute
be
become
more
ubiquitous
intelligence
be
become
more
ambient
meaning
computer
could
observe
collect
data
and
turn
that
feedback
into
insight
we
be
see
an
ever
increase
wave
of
digitization
of
our
life
business
and
our
world
more
broadly
this
be
make
possible
by
an
ever
grow
network
of
connect
device
incredible
compute
capacity
from
the
cloud
insight
from
big
data
and
intelligence
from
machine
learn
i
simplify
all
of
this
and
encourage
microsoft
to
become
mobile
first
and
cloud
first
not
pc
first
or
even
phone
first
we
need
to
envision
a
world
where
the
mobility
of
the
human
experience
across
all
device
be
what
matter
and
the
cloud
make
that
mobility
possible
enable
the
new
generation
of
intelligent
experience
the
transformation
we
would
undertake
across
all
part
of
our
business
would
help
microsoft
and
our
customer
thrive
in
this
new
world
it
might
be
easy
to
be
motivate
to
change
through
envy
we
could
envy
what
apple
have
built
with
its
iphone
and
its
ipad
franchise
or
what
google
have
create
with
its
low
cost
android
phone
and
tablet
but
envy
be
negative
and
outer
direct
not
driven
from
within
and
so
i
knew
that
it
wouldn
t
carry
us
very
far
down
the
path
to
true
renewal
we
could
also
motivate
ourselves
through
competitive
zeal
microsoft
be
know
for
rally
the
troop
with
competitive
fire
the
press
love
that
but
it
s
not
me
my
approach
be
to
lead
with
a
sense
of
purpose
and
pride
in
what
we
do
not
envy
or
combativeness
our
senior
leadership
team
recognize
a
gap
in
the
competitive
landscape
that
microsoft
be
in
the
unique
position
to
fill
you
see
while
our
competitor
define
their
product
as
mobile
we
could
be
about
the
mobility
of
human
experience
experience
make
possible
by
our
cloud
technology
these
two
trend
together
mobile
and
cloud
be
fundamental
to
our
transformation
in
fact
our
marketing
chief
chris
capossela
would
produce
an
ad
for
the
microsoft
cloud
base
on
a
speech
i
give
on
this
subject
in
the

common
tell
the

we
live
in
a
world
of

but
it
be
not
the

that
be
mobile
it
be
you
the
ad
though
make
for
our
broader

also
help
remind
us
of
our
core
the
soul
that
we
almost
lose
microsoft

the

google

a
way

we
do

in
september
five
month
before
i
would
become

become
another
painful
example
of
this
loss
we
be
desperate
to
catch
up
after
miss
the
rise
of
mobile
technology
nokia
which
have
overtaken
motorola
in
the
s
as
the
large
mobile
phone
manufacturer
have
lose
ground
to
apple

nokia
fell
from
the
market

leader
in

to
number
three
by
in
a
risky
move
to
regain
ground
nokia
s
ceo
stephen
elop
announce
it
would
make
window
the
primary
operating
system
for
nokia
smartphones
nokia
and
microsoft
do
make
progress
achieve
double
digit
market
share
in
some
european
country
but
we
still
remain
a
distant
third
the
hope
behind
the
acquisition
be
that
combine
the
engineering
and
design
team
at
nokia
with
software
development
at
microsoft
would
accelerate
our
growth
with
window
phone
and
strengthen
our
overall
device
ecosystem
the
merger
could
be
the
big
dramatic
move
window
need
to
catch
up
with
io
and
android
in
mobile
the
press
criticize
the
idea
and
the
microsoft
board
be
resistant
over
the
summer
while
still
in
negotiation
to
buy
nokia
outright
steve
ballmer
ask
the
member
of
his
leadership
team
his
direct
report
to
vote
thumb
up
or
thumb
down
on
the
deal
he
want
a
public
vote
to
see
where
the
team
be
on
the
matter
i
vote
no
while
i
respect
steve
and
understood
the
logic
of
grow
our
market
share
to
build
a
credible
third
ecosystem
i
do
not
get
why
the
world
need
the
third
ecosystem
in
phone
unless
we
change
the
rule
a
few
month
after
i
become
ceo
the
nokia
deal
close
and
our
team
work
hard
to
relaunch
window
phone
with
new
device
and
a
new
operating
system
that
come
with
new
experience
but
it
be
too
late
to
regain
the
ground
we
have
lose
we
be
chase
our
competitor
taillight
month
later
i
would
have
to
announce
a
total
write
off
of
the
acquisition
as
well
as
plan
to
eliminate
nearly
eighteen
thousand
job
the
majority
of
them
because
of
the
nokia
device
and
service
acquisition
it
be
heartbreaking
to
know
that
so
many
talented
people
who
give
so
much
of
themselves
to
their
work
would
lose
their
job
there
be
many
lesson
a
leader
can
take
from
the
nokia
acquisition
buying
a
company
with
weak
market
share
be
always
risky
what
we
need
most
be
a
fresh
and
distinctive
approach
to
mobile
compute
where
we
go
wrong
initially
be
fail
to
recognize
that
our
great
strength
be
already
part
of
the
soul
of
our
company
invent
new
hardware
for
window
make
compute
more
personal
and
make
our
cloud
service
work
across
any
device
and
any
platform
we
should
only
be
in
the
phone
business
when
we
have
something
that
be
really
differentiate
we
do
ultimately
follow
up
on
this
key
insight
we
focus
our
effort
more
narrowly
by
building
window
phone
with
organization
in
mind
for
example
these
business
customer
now
love
continuum
a
feature
that
make
it
possible
for
a
phone
to
replace
a
pc
to
far
participate
in
mobile
we
also
make
office
run
across
device
in
retrospect
what
i
regret
most
be
the
impact
these
layoff
have
on
very
talented
passionate
people
in
our
phone
division

early
in
my
new
role
bill
gate
and
i
walk
together
from
one
building
to
the
next
to
meet
with
a
reporter
from
vanity
fair
bill
have
decide
to
remain
on
the
board
but
would
step
down
as
chairman
the
foundation
he
d
cofounded
with
his
wife
melinda
would
now
be
his
primary
focus
but
he
remain
passionate
about
software
and
about
microsoft
on
our
walk
he
enthusiastically
talk
about
a
new
product
that
would
blur
the
line
between
a
document
and
a
website
we
brainstorm
how
to
develop
an
architecture
that
would
enable
rich
capability
for
compose
a
report
but
instead
of
a
static
page
it
would
have
all
the
richness
of
an
interactive
website
we
quickly
get
into
the
weed
volley
idea
back
and
forth
about
visualization
data
structure
and
storage
system
at
one
point
bill
look
at
me
smile
and
say
it
be
good
to
be
talk
software
engineering
i
knew
that
part
of
rediscover
the
company
s
soul
be
to
bring
bill
back
to
engage
him
more
deeply
in
the
technical
vision
for
our
product
and
service

a
software

the
stuff
of

at
microsoft
in
his
comical
novel

douglas

of

influence
on

of

twenty
four

slip
underneath
his
door
while
this
exaggerated
legend
doesn
t
exactly
capture
the
culture
i
hop
to
create
i
knew
that
get
our
founder
back
in
the
product
development
loop
would
inspire
our
people
and
up
our
game
over
the
first
several
month
of
my
tenure
i
devote
a
lot
of
time
to
listen
to
anyone
and
everyone
just
as
i
have
promise
to
do
in
that
thanksgiving
memo
to
the
board
i
met
with
all
of
our
leader
and
make
a
point
of
go
out
as
i
always
have
to
meet
with
partner
and
customer
as
i
listen
there
be
two
question
i
be
still
try
to
answer
the
first
why
be
we
here
answer
this
question
would
be
central
to
define
the
company
for
year
to
come
the
second
question
be
what
do
we
do
next
there
be
that
great
closing
scene
in
the
candidate
when
robert
redford
have
finally
won
the
election
pull
his
advisor
into
a
room
and
asks
what
do
we
do
now
for
starter
i
decide
to
listen
straightaway
i
heard
from
hundred
of
employee
at
every
level
and
in
every
part
of
the
company
we
held
focus
group
to
allow
people
to
share
their
opinion
anonymously
as
well
listen
be
the
most
important
thing
i
accomplish
each
day
because
it
would
build
the
foundation
of
my
leadership
for
year
to
come
to
my
first
question
why
do
microsoft
exist
the
message
be
loud
and
clear
we
exist
to
build
product
that
empower
others
that
be
the
meaning
we
re
all
look
to
infuse
into
our
work
i
heard
other
thing
as
well
employee
want
a
ceo
who
would
make
crucial
change
but
one
who
also
respect
the
original
ideal
of
microsoft
which
have
always
be
to
change
the
world
they
want
a
clear
tangible
and
inspire
vision
they
want
to
hear
more
frequently
about
progress
in
transparent
and
simple
way
engineer
want
to
lead
again
not
follow
they
want
to
up
the
coolness
we
have
technology
the
press
would
fawn
over
in
silicon
valley
such
as
lead
edge
artificial
intelligence
but
we
weren
t
show
it
off
what
they
really
demand
be
a
road
map
to
remove
paralysis
for
example
google
make
headline
with
glitzy
demonstration
of
their
artificial
intelligence
experiment
while
we
have
world
class
speech
and
vision
recognition
and
advanced
machine
learn
that
we
kept
under
wrap
the
real
challenge
i
be
contemplate
though
be
how
do
we
take
our
technology
and
do
thing
that
speak
to
our
identity
and
add
unique
value
for
our
customer
on
my
second
question
where
do
we
go
from
here
i
become
convince
that
the
new
ceo
of
microsoft
need
to
do
several
thing
very
well
right
away
during
the
first
year
communicate
clearly
and
regularly
our
sense
of
mission
worldview
and
business
and
innovation
ambition
drive
cultural
change
from
top
to
bottom
and
get
the
right
team
in
the
right
place
build
new
and
surprising
partnership
in
which
we
can
grow
the
pie
and
delight
customer
be
ready
to
catch
the
next
wave
of
innovation
and
platform
shift
reframe
our
opportunity
for
a
mobile
and
cloud
first
world
and
drive
our
execution
with
urgency
stand
for
timeless
value
and
restore
productivity
and
economic
growth
for
everyone
this
list
do
not
suggest
a
formula
for
success
since
even
today
microsoft
be
still
very
much
in
the
midst
of
change
we
will
not
know
the
last
impact
of
our
approach
for
some
time
but
between
the
summer
of
and
we
push
for
change
with
a
steady
drumbeat
have
listen
with
great
intensity
and
curiosity
during
those
first
several
month
it
be
time
to
act
and
to
do
so
with
confidence
and
conviction
my
first
title
at
microsoft
have
be
evangelist
a
common
term
in
technology
for
someone
who
drive
a
standard
or
product
to
achieve
critical
mass
now
here
i
be
evangelize
the
notion
that
we
need
to
rediscover
our
soul
the
mission
of
a
company
be
in
many
way
a
statement
about
its
soul
and
that
s
where
i
go
first
to
make
thing
real
and
drive
fidelity
of
the
idea
through
an
organization
of
plus
people
operating
across
more
than
country
we
developed
a
clear
connection
between
our
mission
and
our
culture
we
define
our
mission
worldview
ambition
and
culture
in
one
page
no
small
feat
for
a
company
that
love
massive
powerpoint
deck
that
be
the
relatively
easy
part
the
harder
part
be
to
not
tweak
it
to
let
it
stand
i
d
want
to
edit
a
word
here
or
there
add
a
row
just
tinker
with
it
before
each
speech
then
i
d
be
remind
again
consistency
be
well
than
perfection
in
the
year
prior
to
take
on
my
new
role
the
executive
team
spent
far
too
much
time
try
to
explain
the
massive
company
and
our
strategy
we
need
a
share
understand
the
simple
framework
we
come
up
with
catalyze
people
to
bring
these
idea
to
life
the
work
in
these
first
few
year
of
my
tenure
be
all
about
get
the
flywheel
of
change
spin
sure
it
take
regular
communication
but
it
also
take
discipline
and
consistency
on
my
part
and
that
of
the
senior
leadership
team
we
need
to
inspire
and
drive
change
we
challenged
ourselves
at
the
end
of
the
next
year
if
we
be
try
in
a
court
of
law
and
the
charge
be
that
we
fail
to
pursue
our
mission
would
there
be
enough
evidence
to
convict
us
just
say
interest
thing
wasn
t
enough
i
all
of
us
have
to
do
them
and
our
employee
have
to
see
how
everything
we
do
reinforce
our
mission
ambition
and
culture
and
then

on
thursday

only
a
few
day
into
the
start
of
microsoft
s
new
fiscal
year
i
sent
an
all
company
email
a
sort
of
manifesto
at
a
m
so
that
it
land
in
in
box
at
the
begin
of
the
day
in
all
u
s
time
zone
and
before
the
weekend
for
employee
around
the
world
we
be
a
global
company
and
we
need
to
think
like
one
in
order
to
accelerate
our
innovation
we
must
rediscover
our
soul
our
unique
core
we
must
all
understand
and
embrace
what
only
microsoft
can
contribute
to
the
world
and
how
we
can
once
again
change
the
world
i
consider
the
job
before
us
to
be
bolder
and
more
ambitious
than
anything
we
have
ever
do
microsoft
be
the
productivity
and
platform
company
for
the
mobile
first
cloud
first
world
we
will
reinvent
productivity
to
empower
every
person
and
every
organization
on
the
planet
to
do
more
and
achieve
more
i
write
that
productivity
for
us
go
well
beyond
document
spreadsheet
and
slide
we
will
ob
over
help
people
who
be
swim
in
a
grow
sea
of
device
apps
data
and
social
network
we
will
build
software
to
be
more
predictive
personal
and
helpful
we
will
think
about
customer
as
dual
user
people
who
use
technology
for
their
work
their
school
and
their
personal
digital
life
in
the
email
i
insert
the
image
of
a
target
and
in
its
center
appear
the
word
digital
work
and
life
experience
surround
by
our
cloud
platform
and
computer
device
soon
there
will
be
billion
people

the
internet
sensor
and
the
internet
of

iot
yes
pc
sale
be
slow
and
so
we
need
to
convert
nietzsche
s
courage
in
the
face
of
reality
into
courage
in
the
face
of

we
need

twenty
four

a
coder
designer
marketer
or

many
offer
helpful
suggestion
and
idea
one
of
my
favorite
be
to
challenge
conventional
think
more
why
be
xbox

since
traditional
television
and

what
if

so
it
could
go

many
write
to
me
to
say
that
after
year
of
frustration
they
felt
a
new
energy
i

a

team
that
share
a
common
worldview
for
anything

we
need
to
be
align

of
legion
of
superheroes
with
each
leader
come
to
the

be
an
inch
apart
on
strategy
at
the
leadership
level
our
product
team
end
up
mile
apart
in

brad

us
navigate
the
ever
evolve
legal
and

landscape

issue
kathleen
constantly
channel
the

for

chris
jean
philippe

judson

for
our
customer
they
be
the
true
hero
of
our
continue
transformation
one
thing
we
be
all
clear
on
be
that
beyond
the
slt
we
need
a
broader
set
of
leader
who
could
be
brought
into
model
the
mission
and
building
the
culture
we
need
for
as
long
as
i
could
remember
each
year
the
top
or
so
executive
would
gather
for
an
annual
retreat
we
left
our
office
to
drive
to
a
remote
mountainous
area
about
two
hour
from
our
headquarters
there
we
would
take
up
residence
at
a
quiet
comfortable
hotel
where
we
would
work
to
get
on
the
same
page
strategically
this
retreat
have
always
be
a
good
idea
each
team
share
product
plan
and
performs
demo
of
their
late
technology
breakthrough
long
before
the
world
will
experience
them
and
everyone
appreciates
have
time
to
reconnect
and
see
their
colleague
over
meal
by
the
fire
but
one
aspect
of
the
offsite
really
bug
me
here
we
be
with
all
this
talent
all
this
bandwidth
and
all
this
iq
in
one
place
just
talk
at
each
other
in
the
deep
wood
and
frankly
it
seem
like
most
of
the
talk
be
about
poke
hole
in
each
other
s
idea
enough
i
figure
it
be
time
to
hit
refresh
and
experiment
that
year
we
do
several
thing
to
symbolize
change
and
to
get
the
top
leader
fully
on
board
i
need
them
to
buy
into
where
we
be
go
and
i
need
them
to
help
get
us
there
the
first
change
to
the
retreat
be
invite
founder
of
company
we
have
acquire
in
the
year
prior
these
new
microsoft
leader
be
mission
orient
innovative
born
in
the
mobile
first
and
cloud
first
world
i
knew
we
could
learn
from
their
fresh
outside
perspective
the
only
problem
be
that
most
of
these
leader
do
not
officially
qualify
to
go
to
executive
retreat
give
the
person
s
level
in
the
organization
to
make
matter
bad
neither
do
the
manager
or
even
their
manager
s
manager
remember
the
retreat
have
be
only
for
the
most
senior
leader
invite
them
be
not
one
of
my
more
popular
decision
but
they
show
up
bright
eyed
completely
ignorant
of
the
history
they
be
break
they
ask
question
they
share
their
own
journey
they
push
us
to
be
well
another
decision
not
universally
love
be
schedule
customer
visit
during
the
retreat
there
be
more
than
a
little
eyerolling
and
groan
why
do
we
have
to
meet
with
customer
during
a
retreat
we
already
meet
with
them
in
the
normal
course
of
business
do
you
think
we
don
t
know
what
our
customer
really
need
but
we
push
through
the
cynicism
and
met
in
a
conference
room
the
first
morning
of
the
retreat
we
split
up
into
a
dozen
or
so
team
and
board
van
each
van
have
a
nervous
account
manager
host
the
trip
along
with
a
cross
section
of
the
company
s
most
senior
researcher
engineer
sale
marketing
finance
hr
and
operation
people
all
new
to
work
with
one
another
the
van
head
off
in
different
direction
across
the
puget
sound
region
to
meet
with
our
customer
school
university
large
enterprise
nonprofit
startup
hospital
small
business
and
the
like
the
executive
listen
they
learn
together
they
make
new
connection
with
one
another
they
put
down
those
proverbial
gun
and
discover
new
way
microsoft
could
fulfill
its
mission
in
the
world
they
experienced
the
power
of
have
a
diverse
cross
company
team
solve
customer
s
problem
together
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
we
do
during
the
experimental
retreat
be
engage
the
leader
in
more
open
and
honest
dialogue
about
our
cultural
evolution
kathleen
hogan
our
chief
people
officer
and
my
partner
in
this
endeavor
knew
we
need
to
get
this
group
s
feedback
and
buy
in
so
after
a
long
day
of
visit
customer
in
the
seattle
area
and
drive
back
into
the
mountain
people
be
again
divide
into
seventeen
random
group
of
about
ten
each
they
be
then
point
to
dinner
table
with
the
assignment
to
share
their
own
account
of
where
the
company
s
culture
stood
and
their
idea
on
how
to
evolve
it
some
of
us
guess
this
exercise
would
be
futile
a
cute
nod
to
leader
engagement
we
figure
these
leader
would
be
tire
they
d
be
persnickety
they
d
want
to
congregate
back
with
their
own
friend
they
d
say
culture
be
my
job
or
hr
s
job
we
be
dead
wrong
discussion
go
long
into
the
even
as
the
broader
executive
team
gain
a
common
understand
of
what
others
experienced
in
lead
their
own
team
and
brainstorm
way
to
create
the
culture
we
all
aspire
to
have
the
next
morning
kathleen
and
each
table
leader
join
me
for
breakfast
to
report
about
what
they
learn
and
to
share
big
idea
idea
born
from
the
previous
night
s
brainstorm
they
be
passionate
eager
to
help
and
the
energy
be
infectious
in
the
end
i
left
the
retreat
inspire
by
those
idea
but
more
importantly
i
left
inspire
by
the
deep
engagement
and
commitment
i
saw
from
these
leader
we
knew
we
need
to
build
on
this
momentum
so
we
enrol
each
of
the
table
discussion
leader
in
a
sort
of
culture
cabinet
a
group
of
trust
advisor
and
senior
leader
who
be
commit
to
help
shape
and

our
most
ambitious
version
ever

the

our
leadership
team
have

mission
statement
our
transformation
be
under
way
though
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
shortly
after

retreat
i
be

to
head
for
a
weeklong
tour
across

deeply
shaken
i
cancel

to
hyderabad
over
time
i
would
realize
that
while
the
death
of
a
parent
be
painful
my
mom
be
always
there
in
my
consciousness
she
will
always
be
there
her
calm
and
mindfulness
continue
to
shape
my
relationship
with
people
and
the
world
around
me
to
this
day
during
that
season
i
reflect
on
her
role
in
my
life
and
her
constant
push
to
find
a
sense
of
contentment
and
meaning
in
all
i
do
this
idea
be
sit
with
me
through
the
spring
as
i
prepared
to
share
our
new
mission
and
culture
with
employee
globally
that
july
i
board
another
plane
for
orlando
florida
with
a
renew
sense
of
optimism
every
year
in
july
some
fifteen
thousand
customer
face
microsoft
employee
gather
for
a
global
summit
to
hear
the
late
strategy
and
initiative
and
to
see
demo
of
new
tech
product
in
development
the
gathering
would
be
my
opportunity
to
update
employee
on
our
progress
and
enroll
them
in
the
change
under
way
with
the
energy
of
thousand
of
colleague
pulse
through
the
auditorium
i
stood
backstage
rehearse
how
i
would
present
our
new
mission
and
the
imperative
to
transform
our
culture
microsoft
people
be
infamous
for
present
a
ton
of
powerpoint
slide
when
they
speak
but
i
don
t
like
to
rely
very
much
on
slide
or
note
so
i
be
free
to
just
channel
what
i
be
think
and
feel
to
let
it
flow
a
computer
on
every
desk
and
in
every
home
which
bill
and
paul
have
introduce
forty
year
earlier
as
the
company
s
mission
be
actually
more
of
a
goal
an
inspire
one
for
its
era
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
i
question
what
it
be
that
have
motivate
us
to
create
personal
computer
in
the
first
place
what
be
the
spirit
behind
the
first
line
of
code
ever
write
for
the
basic
interpreter
on
that
primitive
computer
the
altair
it
be
to
empower
people
and
that
be
still
what
motivate
all
of
our
effort
to
empower
every
person
and
every
organization
on
the
planet
to
achieve
more
we
be
in
the
empowerment
business
i
say
as
i
take
the
stage
and
not
just
to
empower
startup
and
tech
savvy
user
on
the
american
west
coast
but
everyone
on
the
planet
help
people
and
their
organization
achieve
more
be
our
sweet
spot
that
s
what
informs
our
decision
and
inspires
our
passion
it
s
also
what
make
us
different
from
other
company
we
make
thing
that
help
other
people
make
thing
and
make
thing
happen
that
s
the
essence
of
our
mission
but
our
employee
and
our
business
partner
range
from
accenture
to
best
buy
hewlett
packard
to
dell
want
to
hear
more
they
want
to
know
our
business
priority
to
deliver
on
this
promise
of
empowerment
i
say
that
we
must
galvanize
all
of
our
resource
around
three
interconnect
ambition
first
we
must
reinvent
productivity
and
business
process
we
need
to
evolve
beyond
simply
building
individual
productivity
tool
and
start
design
an
intelligent
fabric
for
compute
base
on
four
principle
collaboration
mobility
intelligence
and
trust
people
still
do
important
work
as
individual
but
collaboration
be
the
new
norm
so
we
build
our
tool
to
empower
team
we
would
aspire
to
help
everyone
be
productive
no
matter
where
they
be
regardless
of
the
device
they
use
data
apps
and
setting
all
content
need
to
roam
across
compute
experience
intelligence
be
an
amaze
force
multiplier
to
be
successful
amid
the
explosion
of
data
people
need
analytics
service
and
agent
that
use
intelligence
to
help
them
manage
their
scarcest
resource
time
finally
trust
be
the
foundation
upon
which
everything
we
do
be
built
that
s
why
we
ve
invest
heavily
in
security
and
compliance
that
set
the
standard
for
enterprise
second
we
will
build
the
intelligent
cloud
platform
an
ambition
closely
link
with
the
first
ambition
every
organization
today
need
new
cloud
base
infrastructure
and
application
that
can
convert
vast
amount
of
data
into
predictive
and
analytical
power
through
the
use
of
advanced
analytics
machine
learn
and
ai
from
an
infrastructure
perspective
we
would
come
to
deliver
on
the
promise
of
a
global
hyper
scale
cloud
platform
with
dozen
of
unique
data
center
around
the
world
we
would
over
the
year
invest
billion
of
dollar
each
year
to
build
out
more
and
more
infrastructure
so
that
our
customer
could
scale
their
solution
without
worry
about
their
cloud
platform
s
capacity
or
the
complex
demand
of
transparency
reliability
security
privacy
and
compliance
our
cloud
would
be
open
and
offer
choice
so
that
we
could
support
a
wide
range
of
application
platform
and
developer
tool
we
would
build
our
server
product
to
become
the
edge
of
our
cloud
support
true
hybrid
compute
and
it
would
not
be
just
infrastructure
drive
this
growth
but
also
the
intelligence
we
would
infuse
into
application
we
would
offer
cognitive
service
for
vision
speech
text
recommendation
and
face
and
emotion
detection
developer
would
simply
use
apis
within
their
application
to
augment
user
experience
by
enable
solution
to
see
hear
speak
and
interpret
the
world
around
them
our
intelligent
cloud
would
democratize
these
capability
for
startup
small
business
and
enterprise
alike
third
we
need
to
move
people
from
need
window
to
choose
window
to
love
window
by
create
more
personal
compute
just
as
we
would
transform
business
and
society
through
cloud
compute
we
also
need
to
revolutionize
the
workplace
to
help
organization
and
people
be
more
productive
we
launch
window
with
a
new
concept
to
enable
window
as
a
service
continuously
deliver
value
across
all
of
our
product
we
engineer
window
to
enable
innovative
and
more
natural
way
to
interact
and
engage
with

ask
a
question
with
your

draw
with
the
flick
of
a
pen
and
secure
your
most
important

with
a

mixed

we

cloud
business
something
investor
grabbed
on
to
and
tracked
quarter
after
quarter
it
take
us
from
a
defensive
frame
amid
fall
pc
and
phone
share
to
an
offensive
mindset
we
go
from
deflection
to
ownership
of
our
future
rediscover
the
soul
of
microsoft
redefine
our
mission
and
outline
the
business
ambition
that
would
help
investor
and
customer
grow
our
company
these
have
be
my
priority
with
the
first
inkling
that
i
would
become
ceo
get
our
strategy
right
have
preoccupy
me
from
the
begin
but
as
management
guru
peter
drucker
once
say
culture
eats
strategy
for
breakfast
as
i
conclude
my
talk
that
morning
in
orlando
i
focus
on
what
would
be
our
grandest
endeavor
the
high
hurdle
transform
the
microsoft
culture

it
s
surprising
when
an
arena
jammed
to
the
rafter
with
fifteen
thousand
people
fall
silent
it
s
also
unsettle
when
nothing
can
be
see
because
of
the
blinding
stage
light
that
s
how
i
felt
as
i
stood
onstage
in
orlando
i
could
feel
a
small
lump
grow
in
my
throat
i
be
about
to
launch
into
a
topic
that
be
at
once
crucial
for
microsoft
to
get
right
but
also
deeply
personal
for
me
i
m
go
to
close
out
by
talk
about
our
culture
to
me
it
be
everything
i
say
bill
and
steve
have
make
this
annual
address
many
time
to
employee
over
the
year
bill
often
look
off
into
the
future
predict
tech
trend
and
how
microsoft
would
lead
steve
rally
the
troop
whip
everyone
into
a
frenzy
of
excitement
i
have
use
the
first
part
of
my
speech
to
proclaim
a
new
mission
one
root
in
rediscover
the
soul
of
our
company
i
have
outline
a
series
of
new
business
ambition
but
as
i
have
foreshadow
in
that
thanksgiving
memo
to
the
board
of
director
real
change
depend
on
culture
change
culture
can
be
a
vague
and
amorphous
term
in
his
perceptive
book
culture
the
literary
theorist
terry
eagleton
write
that
the
idea
of
culture
be
multifaceted
a
kind
of
social
unconscious
with
razor
precision
he
separate
culture
into
four
different
meaning
but
the
most
relevant
for
an
organization
be
the
value
custom
belief
and
symbolic
practice
that
men
and
woman
live
and
breathe
each
day
culture
be
make
up
of
act
that
become
habitual
and
accrue
to
something
coherent
and
meaningful
eagleton
who
life
in
ireland
note
that
a
mailbox
in
his
country
be
evidence
of
civilization
but
the
fact
they
be
all
paint
green
be
evidence
of
culture
i
think
of
culture
as
a
complex
system
make
up
of
individual
mindset
the
mindset
of
those
in
front
of
me
culture
be
how
an
organization
think
and
act
but
individual
shape
it
in
my
own
life
it
s
the
language
routine
and
mindset
of
my
parent
back
in
india
and
my
immediate
family
in
seattle
that
help
form
me
and
still
guide
me
to
this
day
it
s
that
diverse
collection
of
classmate
back
in
hyderabad
who
share
a
learn
mindset
that
would
propel
them
on
to
leadership
in
government
business
sport
and
entertainment
in
all
of
these
experience

d
be
encourage
to
follow
my
curiosity
and
to
push
the
limit
of
my
own
capability
and
now
i
be
begin
to
see
how
this
approach
would
be
critical
to
microsoft
as
it
confront
the
burden
of
its
past

of
the

her
diagnosis
take
us
on
a
journey
of
discovery
to
help
her
first
be
the
internal
journey
concern
for
her
but
also
the
need
to
educate
ourselves
next
come
action
we
found
a
school
in
vancouver
canada
that
specializes
in
learn
difference
like
hers
we
spent
five
year
of
our
life
splitting
time
and
family
between
vancouver
and
seattle
in
order
to
augment
her
regular
school
while
keep
zain
s
care
consistent
in
seattle
all
of
this
meant
separation
at
many
level
husband
and
wife
father
and
daughter
mother
and
son
we
be
maintain
two
life
in
two
country
anu
drove
thousand
of
mile
between
seattle
and
vancouver
in
rain
snow
and
darkness
and
so
do
i
on
alternate
weekend
for
five
year
it
be
a
try
time
but
anu
and
the
girl
make
some
exceptional
friend
in
canada
as
a
family
we
learn
together
that
these
predicament
be
universal
family
from
california
australia
palestine
and
new
zealand
converge
on
the
vancouver
school
with
issue
and
challenge
i
discover
that
recognition
of
these
universal
predicament
lead
to
universal
empathy
empathy
for
and
among
child
adult
parent
and
teacher
empathy
we
learn
be
indivisible
and
be
a
universal
value
and
we
learn
that
empathy
be
essential
to
deal
with
problem
everywhere
whether
at
microsoft
or
at
home
here
in
the
united
state
or
globally
that
be
also
a
mindset
a
culture
as
i
continued
my
speech
at
the
global
sale
conference
the
empathy
i
felt
for
my
kid
and
the
empathy
i
felt
for
the
people
listen
in
that
audience
be
on
my
mind
and
in
my
emotion
we
can
have
all
the
bold
ambition
we
can
have
all
the
bold
goal
we
can
aspire
to
our
new
mission
but
it
s
only
go
to
happen
if
we
live
our
culture
if
we
teach
our
culture
and
to
me
that
model
of
culture
be
not
a
static
thing
it
be
about
a
dynamic
learn
culture
in
fact
the
phrase
we
use
to
describe
our
emerge
culture
be
growth
mindset
because
it
s
about
every
individual
every
one
of
us
have
that
attitude
that
mindset
of
be
able
to
overcome
any
constraint
stand
up
to
any
challenge
make
it
possible
for
us
to
grow
and
thereby
for
the
company
to
grow
i
told
my
colleague
that
i
be
not
talk
bottom
line
growth
i
be
talk
about
our
individual
growth
we
will
grow
as
a
company
if
everyone
individually
grows
in
their
role
and
in
their
life
my
wife
anu
and
i
have
be
bless
with
wonderful
child
and
we
ve
have
to
learn
their
special
need
that
have
change
everything
for
us
it
s
take
me
on
this
journey
of
develop
more
empathy
for
others
and
what
give
me
deep
meaning
be
that
ability
to
take
new
idea
and
empathy
for
people
to
connect
the
two
and
have
great
impact
that
s
what
give
me
the
great
satisfaction
it
s
why
i
work
for
microsoft
and
that
s
what
i
aspire
for
each
one
of
you
to
do
as
you
work
here
our
culture
need
to
be
about
realize
our
personal
passion
and
use
microsoft
as
a
platform
to
pursue
that
passion
for
me
my
great
satisfaction
have
come
from
my
passion
to
see
technology
become
more
accessible
for
people
with
disability
and
to
help
improve
their
life
in
a
myriad
of
way
just
as
my
predecessor
steve
ballmer
have
do
at
these
annual
gathering
i
d
close
my
speech
with
a
call
to
action
but
one
with
a
very
different
mood
and
purpose
i
have
essentially
ask
employee
to
identify
their
innermost
passion
and
to
connect
them
in
some
way
to
our
new
mission
and
culture
in
so
do
we
would
transform
our
company
and
change
the
world
when
you
re
ceo
these
goal
can
be
easy
to
imagine
but
when
an
employee
s
aperture
be
small
a
marketer
in
malaysia
or
technical
support
in
texas
such
a
mission
can
seem
distant
and
unattainable
so
the
challenge
i
d
set
forth
in
my
speech
might
be
a
daunt
one
i
wonder
whether
i
d
connect
with
the
audience
or
left
them
baffle
and
untouched
feel
my
emotion
begin
to
overcome
me
i
skip
my
last
slide
and
quickly
exit
the
stage
jill
point
at
the
doorway
to
the
auditorium
not
my
private
green
room
watch
with
them
as
a
video
start
present
not
just
the
year
s
progress
but
the
expansive
mission
driven
opportunity
ahead
i
slip
back
into
the
auditorium
through
a
side
entrance
no
one
could
see
me
in
the
darken
auditorium
every
eye
be
glue
to
the
screen
but
i
be
watch
them
gauge
the
emotion
in
the
room
everyone
be
lock
in
and
some
be
softly
wipe
away
tear
i
knew
then
that
we
be
onto
something
chapter
a
cultural
renaissance
from
know
it
alls
to
learn
it
alls
a
few
day
later
i
be
in
nanyuki
kenya
stand
inside
a
solar
power
shipping
container
that
double
as
an
internet
caf
one
of
our
partner
mawingu

cloud
network
provide
these
rural
community
with
low
cost
internet
service
which
have
open
up
access
to
knowledge
for
schoolkids
and
parent
alike
in
fact
in
just
one
short
year
educational
test
score
have
dramatically
increase
inside
the
caf
i
stop
to
chat
with
chris
baraka
who
us
the
connectivity
here
to
make
a
living
as
a
writer
and
teacher
i
also
observe
farmer
pause
from
their
outdoor
work
to
check
crop
price
with
only
a
dozen
people
in
attendance
one
would
never
know
that
i
be
celebrate
the
global
launch
of
window
a
microsoft
product
at
the
core
of
our
strategy
two
decade
earlier
the
launch
of
window
with
its
pricey
theme
song
start
me
up
by
the
roll
stone
midnight
retail
party
and
medium
hysteria
have
help
create
a
phenomenon
of
big
and
big
software
launch
competitor
try
to
outdo
and
out
lavish
each
other
s
launch
event
in
hope
of
spark
customer
impulse
to
purchase
but
that
be
then
and
this
be
now
a
refresh
product
launch
strategy
one
that
reflect
the
time
and
our
new
mission
and
culture
be
need
initially
our
communication
chief
frank
shaw
have
present
a
first
class
launch
plan
complete
with
visual
extravaganza
like
set
ablaze
the
sydney
opera
house
with
window
brand
colorful
light
he
felt
the
product
need
these
kind
of
inspire
and
hopefully
medium
attention
get
image
in
paris
new
york
tokyo
and
elsewhere
in
order
to
generate
the
news
coverage
we
have
come
to
expect
but
the
approach
didn
t
feel
right
i
felt
that
this
be
one
of
those
moment
to
show
a
different
microsoft
we
be
struggle
with
what
to
do
and
i
decide
to
take
a
brief
break
from
the
meeting
to
get
coffee
during
that
break
a
side
conversation
among
some
of
the
team
member
rise
above
the
chatter
we
should
launch
window
in
kenya
kenya
be
a
country
where
we
have
customer
partner
and
employee
it
s
a
nation
with
great
promise
one
that
with
digital
transformation
could
leapfrog
over
others
by
get
infrastructure
and
skill
in
place
the
launch
of
window
wasn
t
about
one
product
it
be
about
our
mission
and
if
we
re
go
to
seek
to
empower
every
person
on
the
planet
why
not
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
planet
and
make
that
real
i
walk
down
the
hall
to
frank
s
office
let
s
take
a
chance
i
knew
that
we
have
built
a
low
cost
high
speed
internet
connectivity
solution
that
leverage
an
innovative
technology
call
tv
white
space
the
unused
broadband
spectrum
that
exists
in
between
television
channel
to
connect
rural
poor
area
like
nanyuki
kenya
to
the
web
we
could
show
off
not
just
window
but
also
its
relevance
to
anyone
and
everyone
no
matter
their
geography
or
socioeconomic
status
frank
thought
about
it
another
minute
and
agree
what
well
way
to
demonstrate
our
new
mission
and
emerge
culture
than
to
be
in
eastern
africa
a
region
that
exemplifies
both
the
challenge
and
the
opportunity
for
technology
to
transform
and
create
economic
growth
we
might
not
get
all
of
the
tv
camera
we
use
to
get
but
we
d
be
demonstrate
our
desire
to
understand
every
customer
s
context
include
that
of
farmer
in
a
remote
african
village
for
whom
technology
tool
can
mean
the
difference
between
abject
poverty
and
hope
by
embrace
this
new
cultural
mindset
we
d
be
able
to
start
listen
learn
more
and
talk
less
so
what
do
this
growth
mindset
reveal
one
of
the
lesson
we
take
back
be
that
it
s
too
simplistic
to
call
a
country
like
kenya
a
develop
economy
or
the
united
state
a
developed
one
both
country
have
educate
tech
savvy
customer
capable
of
use
our
most
sophisticated
product
and
both
country
have
potential
customer
with
little
or
no
skill
sure
there
be
high
concentration
of
one
or
the
other
in
each
country
but
it
s
a
false
distinction
simply
to
think
of
country
as
either
developed
or
develop
the
window
launch
in
kenya
struck
a
far
more
global
tone
for
the
company
and
it
also
taught
us
valuable
lesson
i
like
to
think
that
the
c
in
ceo
stand
for
culture
the
ceo
be
the
curator
of
an
organization
s
culture
as
i
have
told
employee
in
orlando
anything
be
possible
for
a
company
when
its
culture
be
about
listen
learn
and
harness
individual
passion
and
talent
to
the
company
s
mission
create
that
kind
of
culture
be
my
chief
job
as
ceo
and
so
whether
it
be
through
public
event
like
the
launch
of
window
or
through
speech
email
tweet
internal
post
or
monthly
employee
q
a
session
i
plan
to
use
every
opportunity
at
my
disposal
to
encourage
our
team
to
live
this
culture
of
dynamic
learn
of
course
exhortation
from
the
ceo
be
only
a
fraction
of
what
it
take
to
create
real
culture
change
especially
in
a
huge
very
successful
organization
like
microsoft
an
organizational
culture
be
not
something
that
can
simply
unfreeze
change
and
then
refreeze
in
an
ideal
way
it
take
deliberate
work
and
it
take
some
specific
idea
about
what
the
culture
should
become
it
also
require
dramatic
concrete
action
that
seize
the
attention
of
team
member
and
push
them
out
of
their
familiar
comfort
zone
our
culture
have
be
rigid
each
employee
have
to
prove
to
everyone
that
he
or
she
knew
it
all
and
be
the
smartest
person
in
the
room
accountability
deliver
on
time
and
hit
number
trumped
everything
meeting
be
formal
everything
have
to
be
plan
in
perfect
detail
before
the
meeting
and
it
be
hard
to
do
a
skip
level
meeting
if
a
senior
leader
want
to
tap
the
energy
and
creativity
of
someone
low
down
in
the
organization
she
or
he
need
to
invite
that
person
s
bos
and
so
on
hierarchy
and
peck
order
have
take
control
and
spontaneity
and
creativity
have
suffer
as
a
result
the
culture
change
i
want
be
actually
root
in
the
microsoft
i
originally
join
it
be
center
on
exercise
a
growth
mindset
every
day
in
three
distinct
way
first
we
need
to
ob
about
our
customer
at
the
core
of
our
business
must
be
the
curiosity
and
desire
to
meet
a
customer
s
unarticulated
and
unmet
need
with
great
technology
there
be
no
way
to
do
that
unless
we
absorb
with
deeper
insight
and
empathy
what
they
need
to
me
this
be
not
something
abstract
but
rather
something
we
all
get
to
practice
each
day
when
we
talk
to
customer
we
need
to
listen
it
s
not
an
idle
exercise
it
be
about
be
able
to
predict
thing
that
customer
will
love
that
s
growth
mindset
we
learn
about
our
customer
and
their
business
with
a
beginner
s
mind
and
then
bring
them
solution
that
meet
their
need
we
need
to
be
insatiable
in
our
desire
to
learn
from
the
outside
and
bring
that
learn
into
microsoft
while
still
innovate
to
surprise
and
delight
our
user
second
we
be
at
our
best
when
we
actively
seek
diversity
and
inclusion
if
we
be
go
to
serve
the
planet
as
our
mission
state
we
need
to
reflect
the
planet
the
diversity
of
our
workforce
must
continue
to
improve
and
we
need
to
include
a
wide
range
of
opinion
and
perspective
in
our
think
and
decision
make
in
every
meeting
don
t
just
listen
make
it
possible
for
others
to
speak
so
that
everyone
s
idea
come
through
inclusiveness
will
help
us
become
open
to
learn
about
our
own
bias
and
change
our
behavior
so
we
can
tap
into
the
collective
power
of
everyone
in
the
company
we
need
not
just
value
difference
but
also
actively
seek
them
out
invite
them
in
and
as
a
result
our
idea
will
be
well
our
product
will
be
well
and
our
customer
will
be
well
serve
finally
we
be
one
company
one
microsoft
not
a
confederation
of
fiefdom
innovation
and
competition
don
t
respect
our
silo
our
org
boundary
so
we
have
to
learn
to
transcend
those
barrier
we
be
a
family
of
individual
united
by
a
single
share
mission
it
be
not
about
do
what
s
comfortable
within
our
own
organization
it
s
about
get
outside
that
comfort
zone
reach
out
to
do
thing
that
be
most
important
for
customer
for
some
company
this
come
more
naturally
for
example
those
tech
company
born
with
an
open
source
mentality
get
it
one
group
may
create
code
and
intellectual
property
but
it
s
open
and
available
for
inspection
and
improvement
from
other
group
inside
and
outside
the
company
i
tell
my
colleague
they
get
to
own
a
customer
scenario
not
the
code
our
code
may
need
to
be
tailor
one
way
for
a
small
business
and
another
way
for
a
public
sector
customer
it
s
our
ability
to
work
together
that
make
our
dream
believable
and
ultimately
achievable
we
must
learn
to
build
on
the
idea
of
others
and
collaborate
across
boundary
to
bring
the
best
of
microsoft
to
our
customer
as
one
one
microsoft
when
we
exercise
a
growth
mindset
by
be
customer
obsess
diverse
and
inclusive
and
act
as
one
microsoft
that
s
when
we
live
our
mission
and
truly
make
a
difference
in
the
world
take
together
these
concept
embody
the
growth
in
culture
i
set
out
to
inculcate
at
microsoft
i
talk
about
these
idea
every
chance
i
get
and
i
look
for
opportunity
to
change
our
practice
and
behavior
to
make
the
growth
mindset
vivid
and
real
part
of
the
culture
change
be
to
give
people
the
breathing
room
the
space
to
bring
their
own
voice
and
experience
to
the
conversation
the
last
thing
i
want
be
for
employee
to
think
of

thing
i
want
them
to
see
it
as
their
thing
as
microsoft
s
thing
to
encourage
the
shift
toward
a
learn
culture
we
create
an
annual
hackathon
during
our
oneweek
celebration
a
time
for
everyone
to
be
on
campus
simultaneously
to
make
connection
learn
about
what
others
be
do
find
inspiration
and
collaborate
play
off
the
notion
of
growth
mindset
the

they
didn

priority
people
often

go
well
i
suppose
my
response
be
very
eastern
we

make
great
progress
but
we
should
never
be
do
it
s
not
a

it
s
a
way

be
frankly
i
be
wire
that
way
when
i
learn
about
a
shortcoming
it
s
a
thrill
moment
the
person
who
point
it
out
have
give
me
the
gift
of
insight
it
s
about
question
ourselves
each
day
where
be
all
the
place
today
that
i
have
a
fix
mindset
where
do
i
have
a
growth
mindset
as
ceo
i
m
not
exempt
from
have
to
ask
myself
these
question
each
of
my
business
decision
can
be
scrutinize
in
term
of
whether
or
not
it
have
help
microsoft
shift
toward
the
growth
mindset
we
aspire
to
fix
mindset
decision
be
one
that
reinforce
the
tendency
to
continue
do
what
we
ve
always
do
traditionally
when
we
launch
a
new
version
of
window
exist
window
user
would
pay
us
to
upgrade
terry
myerson
the
executive
in
charge
of
our
window
and
device
group
have
the
growth
mindset
to
shift
for
a
time
to
a
free
consumer
upgrade
and
forgo
that
revenue
in
just
a
little
over
a
year
it
have
become
the
most
popular
window
upgrade
ever
with
hundred
of
million
of
user
and
still
rise
we
want
customer
to
make
that
shift
to
love
window
and
to
have
the
most
personal
and
secure
device
upon
reflection
we
learn
a
lot
from
nokia
even
though
it
result
in
a
painful
write
down
of
the
asset
acquire
the
finnish
smartphone
company
lead
to
numeric
growth
in
term
of
people
and
revenue
but
ultimately
we
fail
to
break
through
in
the
highly
competitive
mobile
phone
business
importantly
though
we
learn
a
lot
about
what
it
mean
to
design
build
and
manufacture
hardware
our
acquisition
of
sweden
base
mojang
and
its
video
game
minecraft
also
represent
a
growth
mindset
because
it
create
new
energy
and
engagement
for
people
on
our
mobile
and
cloud
technology
and
it
would
open
new
opportunity
in
the
education
software
space
the
story
of
how
the
minecraft
acquisition
happen
illustrates
some
of
the
key
quality
of
a
growth
mindset
include
the
readiness
to
empower
and
learn
from
individual
who
posse
insight
and
passion
that
the
rest
of
the
organization
need
to
learn
from
in
this
case
the
individual
be
phil
spencer
who
head
xbox
phil
understood
that
we
need

be
the
most
attractive

he

it
s
the
rare
video
game
that
be
invite
into
the
classroom
and
minecraft
be
not
just
invite
but
desire
teacher
love
the
way
it
encourages
building
collaboration
and
exploration
it
s
a
d
sandbox
of
sort
if
the
classroom
curriculum
call
for
building
a
river
ecosystem
with
marsh
minecraft
can
do
that
if
the
river
need
to
flow
the
minecraft
logic
function
can
make
that
happen
it
teach
digital
citizenship
because
it
s
multiplayer
twelve

within
minute
they

phil
s
bos
at
the
time
chose
not
to
move
forward
for
some
such
a
visible
high
level
rejection
could
have
be
wither
but
phil
didn
t
give
up
he
knew
that
this
beloved
game
belong
in
a
place
where
it
could
continue
to
scale
up
and
prosper
he
also
knew
that
for
microsoft
bring
minecraft
into
our
ecosystem
could
lead
to
deeper
engagement
with
the
next
generation
of
gamers
he
knew
our

corner
of
the
globe
phil
maintain
a
great
relationship
with
mojang
continue
to
build
trust
and
one
day
phil
s
team
get
a
text
that
the

be
for
sale
again
they
could
have
go
to
any
of
our
competitor
to
strike
a
deal
but
they
come
back
to
us
phil
have
recently
become
the
head
of
xbox
and
i
be
new
in
my
role
as
ceo
he
brought
the
deal
to
me
for
reconsideration
i
felt
we
could
bring
the
inherent
strength
of
microsoft
to
the
product
while
preserve
the
integrity
and
creativity
of
the
small
indie
group
that
invent
it
we
pull
the
trigger
on
a
billion
acquisition
today
minecraft
be
one
of
the
bestselling
game
of
all
time
on
the
pc
xbox
and
mobile
it
have
tremendous
and
last
gamer
engagement
bill
gate
and
steve
ballmer
who
be
still
on
the
board
when
the
deal
be
present
later
laugh
and
say
they
have
initially
scratch
their
head
fail
to
understand
the
wisdom
of
the
move
now
we
all
get
it
that
s
a
growth
mindset
and
it
highlight
individual
empowerment
what
one
person
or
one
team
can
do
against
the
odds
even
though
i
be
ambivalent
about
question
from
outsider
about
how
the
culture
change
be
go
it
s
easy
to
see
there
be
a
tangible
shift
happen
inside
microsoft
if
you
want
to
understand
the
culture
inside
a
software
company
show
up
at
a
meeting
that
include
engineer
from
different
part
of
the
company
these
be
very
smart
people
who
be
passionate
about
building
great
product
but
be
they
plug
into
what
customer
need
and
want
do
they
include
diverse
opinion
and
capability
when
write
code
and
do
they
act
like
they
re
on
the
same
team
even
if
they
work
in
different
group
answer
to
question
like
these
serve
as
a
great
barometer
for
the
culture
we
need
demonstrate
a
growth
mindset
customer
centric
diverse
and
inclusive
one
company
i
remember
a
gathering
in
of
top
engineer
from
across
microsoft
it
be
one
of
a
series
of
whip
short
for
window
high
power
summit
envision
as
opportunity
to
improve
product
and
solve
problem
that
rely
on
collaboration
across
code
base
there
be
a
high
degree
of
ownership
and
a
lot
of
pride
but
to
my
dismay
the
meeting
deteriorate
into
a
gripe
session
one
developer
argue
that
he
have
fix
something
in
the
window
code
base
that
would
help
with
a
problem
customer
have
discover
in
an
application
that
ran
on
window
even
though
he
have
fix
it
the
window
developer
be
not
accept
or
check
in
his
new
code
the
discussion
quickly
devolve
into
argument
and
then
name
call
this
be
not
the
culture
we
re
look
for
when
i
attend
another
whip
a
few
year
later
i
heard
a
very
different
conversation
a
developer
announce
that
he
have
found
a
mean
for
capture
or
take
a
screenshot
of
a
move
image
a
big
improvement
over
our
exist
snip
tool
which
be
capable
only
of
capture
a
static
image
a
small
piece
of
code
that
make
a
big
difference
to
a
designer
or
editor
as
in
though
his
fix
have
not
yet
be
integrate
into
the
window
code
with
a
growth
mindset
yet
be
an
important
clarification
terry
myerson
the
head
of
window
jumped
into
the
conversation
before
the
argue
and
finger
point
could
begin
send
the
fix
again
and
we
ll
take
care
of
it
even
back
in
the
energy
for
culture
change
have
be
there
but
we
need
to
create
a
conduit
for
change
we
have
to
break
down
the
dam
and
allow
change
to
flow
now
that
have
begin
to
happen
the
key
to
the
culture
change
be
individual
empowerment
we
sometimes
underestimate
what
we
each
can
do
to
make
thing
happen
and
overestimate
what
others
need
to
do
for
us
we
have
to
get
out
of
the
mode
of
think
in
which
we
assume
that
others
have
more
power
over
us
than
we
do
i
become
irritated
once
during
an
employee
q
a
when
someone
ask
me
why
can
t
i
print
a
document
from
my
mobile
phone
i
politely
told
him
make
it
happen
you
have
full
authority
another
time
member
of
a
chat
group
on
yammer
our
corporate
social
medium
service
for
internal
conversation
be
complain
that
people
be
leave
half
use
milk
carton
in
the
office
refrigerator
apparently
people
would
open
a
fresh
eight
ounce
container
of
milk
pour
some
in
their
coffee
or
tea
and
then
leave
it
out
on
the
counter
think
others
would
finish
it
but
no
one
want
to
use
a
personal
milk
container
open
by
somebody
else
that
be
begin
to
sour
it
blew
up
on
yammer
and
i
use
one
of
my
video
message
to
employee
to
have
a
good
laugh
at
it
showcasing
it
as
a
humorous
example
of
a
fix
mindset
culture
change
be
hard
it
can
be
painful
the
fundamental
source
of
resistance
to
change
be
fear
of
the
unknown
really
big
question
for
which
there
be
no
certain
answer
can
be
scary
consider
one
of
the
question
we
ask
ourselves
continually
what
be
the
compute
platform
of
the
future
window
have
be
the
pc
platform
of
choice
for
decade
but
now
we
re
imagine
a
new
era
the
cloud
and
its
edge
with
multisensory
and
multi
device
experience
will
enable
new
computer
and
new
compute
that
be
sensitive
to
human
presence
and
responsive
to
individual
preference
we
re
hard
at
work
building
the
ultimate
compute
experience
blending
mixed
reality
artificial
intelligence
and
quantum
compute
which
of
these
will
dominate
the
compute
world
of
or
will
some
new
breakthrough
emerge
that
be
currently
unimagined
anyone
who
say
they
can
accurately
predict
the
future
trajectory
of
tech
be
not
to
be
trust
however
a
growth
mindset
enables
you
to
well
anticipate
and
react
to
uncertainty
fear
of
the
unknown
can
send
you
in
a
million
direction
and
sometimes
it
just
dead
end
with
inertia
a
leader
have
to
have
an
idea
what
to
do
to
innovate
in
the
face
of
fear
and
inertia
we
need
to
be
willing
to
lean
into
uncertainty
to
take
risk
and
to
move
quickly
when
we
make
mistake
recognize
failure
happens
along
the
way
to
mastery
sometimes
it
feel
like
a
bird
learn
to
fly
you
flap
around
for
a
while
and
then
you
run
around
learn
to
fly
be
not
pretty
but
fly
be
if
you
want
to
see
what
flap
around
look
like
do
a
search
for
me
and
karma
it
s
a
fall
day
in
phoenix
arizona
and
i
be
attend
the
grace
hopper
celebration
of
woman
in
compute
the
world
s
large
gathering
of
woman
technologist
diversity
and
inclusion
be
a
bedrock
strategy
in
building
the
culture
we
need
and
want
but
as
a
company
and
as
an
industry
we
ve
come
up
far
too
short
accord
to
one
report
woman
in
the
united
state
held
percent
of
professional
occupation
in
the
workforce
but
only
percent
of
professional
compute
occupation
that
s
a
real
problem
and
one
that
will
only
get
bad
with
inaction
since
the
number
of
computer
related
job
be
only
increase
as
the
leader
of
a
company
a
husband
and
the
father
of
two
young
woman
i
see
this
failure
to
attract
and
retain
woman
in
compute
as
bad
business
and
it
s
wrong
which
make
what
i
say
that
day
in
phoenix
all
the
more
perplex
not
to
mention
embarrass
early
in
my
appearance
there
be
loud
cheer
when
i
say
we
cannot
settle
for
supply
side
excuse
the
real
issue
be
how
to
get
more
woman
inside
the
organization
but
near
the
end
of
my
interview
onstage
dr
maria
klawe
a
computer
scientist
president
of
harvey
mudd
college
and
a
former
microsoft
board
member
ask
me
what
advice
i
have
for
woman
seek
a
pay
raise
who
be
not
comfortable
ask
it
s
a
great
question
because
we
know
woman
leave
the
industry
when
they
be
not
properly
recognize
and
reward
i
only
wish
my
answer
have
be
great
it
be
not
i
pause
for
a
moment
and
remember
an
early
president
at
microsoft
who
have
told
me
once
that
human
resource
system
be
long
term
efficient
but
short
term
inefficient
in
other
word
over
time
you
be
reward
and
recognize
for
stellar
work
but
not
always
in
real
time
it
s
not
really
about
ask
for
the
raise
but
know
and
have
faith
that
the
system
will
actually
give
you
the
right
raise
as
you
go
along
i
respond
and
that
might
be
one
of
the
additional
superpower
that
woman
who
don
t
ask
for
the
raise
have
because
that
s
good
karma
it
ll
come
back
long
term
efficiency
solves
it
dr
klawe
whom
i
respect
enormously
kindly
push
back
this
be
one
of
the
few
thing
i
disagree
with
you
on
elicit
scatter
applause
from
the
audience
she
use
it
as
a
teach
moment
direct
her
comment
to
the
woman
in
the
audience
but
clearly
give
me
a
lesson
i
won
t
forget
she
told
the
story
of
a
time
when
she
be
ask
how
much
pay
would
be
sufficient
and
she
just
say
whatever
be
fair
by
not
advocate
for
herself
she
didn
t
get
what
be
fair
have
learn
that
lesson
the
hard
way
she
encourage
the
audience
to
do
their
homework
and
to
know
what
the
proper
salary
be
afterward
we
hug
and
left
the
stage
to
warm
applause
but
the
damage
be
do
the
criticism
deserve
and
biting
come
swiftly
through
wave
of
social
medium
and
international
radio
tv
and
newspaper
coverage
my
chief
of
staff
smugly
read
me
a
tweet
capture
the
moment
i
hope
satya
s
comms
person
be
a
woman
and
be
ask
for
a
raise
right
now
honestly
i
left
the
conference
inspire
and
energize
but
i
be
mad
at
myself
for
blundering
such
an
important
chance
to
communicate
my
own
commitment
and
microsoft
s
to
increase
the
number
of
woman
we
hire
at
every
level
of
our
industry
i
be
frustrate
but
i
also
be
determine
to
use
the
incident
to
demonstrate
what
a
growth
mindset
look
like
under
pressure
a
few
hour
later
i
shot
off
an
email
to
everyone
in
the
company
i
encourage
them
to
watch
the
video
and
i
be
quick
to
point
out
that
i
have
answer
the
question
completely
wrong
without
a
doubt
i
wholeheartedly
support
program
at
microsoft
and
in
the
industry
that
bring
more
woman
into
technology
and
close
the
pay
gap
i
believe
men
and
woman
should
get
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
when
it
come
to
career
advice
on
get
a
raise
when
you
think
it
s
deserve
maria
s
advice
be
the
right
advice
if
you
think
you
deserve
a
raise
you
should
just
ask
a
few
day
later
in
my
regular
all
employee
q
a
i
apologize
and
explain
that
i
have
receive
this
advice
from
my
mentor
and
have
follow
it
but
this
advice
underestimated
exclusion
and
bias
conscious
and
unconscious
any
advice
that
advocate
passivity
in
the
face
of
bias
be
wrong
leader
need
to
act
and
shape
the
culture
to
root
out
bias
and
create
an
environment
where
everyone
can
effectively
advocate
for
themselves
i
have
go
to
phoenix
to
learn
and
i
certainly
do
but
perhaps
what
taught
me
more
be
hearing
story
from
woman
i
deeply
respect
about
the
bias
they
experienced
earlier
in
their
career
be
told
to
smile
more
often
be
block
from
join
the
good
old
boy
club
or
face
the
difficult
trade
off
between
take
time
off
after
have
a
baby
or
relentlessly
climb
the
career
ladder
these
powerful
woman
who
share
the
hurt
of
their
past
experience
with
me

this
time
i
also
found
myself
reflect
on
the
sacrifice
my
mother
make
for
me
and
the
challenge
decision
anu
have
make
to
leave

care
for

more
than
two

she
make
it
possible
for
my
career
to
advance
at
microsoft
since
my
remark
at
grace

have
make
the
commitment
to
drive
real
change
in
this
area

publicly
about

and

in
some
way
i
m
glad
i
mess
up
in
such
a
public
forum
because
it
help
me
confront
an
unconscious
bias
i
didn
t
know
i
have
and
it
help
me
find
a
new
sense
of
empathy
for
the
great
woman
in
my
life
and
at
my
company
this
episode
lead
me
to
reflect
on
my
own
experience
as
an
immigrant
hearing
racial
slur
toward
indian
after
move
to
america
never
stung
me
i
just
blew
them
off
an
easy
thing
to
do
for
a
man
raise
in
the
majority
and
with
privilege
in
india
even
when
some
people
in
position
of
power
have
remark
that
there
be
too
many
asian
ceo
in
technology
i
ve
ignore
their
ignorance
but
as
i
grow
old
and
watch
a
second
generation
of
indian
my
kid
and
their
friend
grow
up
as
minority
in
the
united
state
i
cannot
help
but
think
about
how
our
experience
differ
it
infuriates
me
to
think
they
will
hear
and
grapple
with
racial
slur
and
ignorance
when
i
join
microsoft
there
be
an
undercurrent
among
the
indian
engineer
and
programmer
we
be
aware
that
despite
our
contribution
there
have
yet
to
be
one
of
us
promote
to
vice
president
a
rank
that
recognizes
a
leader
as
an
officer
of
the
company
we
could
get
to
a
certain
level
but
not
beyond
in
fact
a
senior
executive
long
since
go
from
the
company
once
told
another
indian
colleague
that
it
be
because
of
our
accent
an
idea
as
derogatory
as
it
be
outdated
it
be
the
s
and
i
be
surprised
to
hear
such
bias
within
such
a
lead
edge
company
especially
one
lead
by
and
found
by
such
open
mind
leader
yet
when
i
look
around
sure
enough
there
be
no
indian
vps
despite
the
well
know
top
performance
of
so
many
indian
engineer
and
manager
it
be
not
until
that
myself
and
a
few
other
indian
be
promote
to
the
executive
rank
whether
cultural
or
attain
wisdom
we
felt
that
if
we
work
hard
and
kept
our
head
down
eventually
good
thing
would
happen
one
of
my
colleague
at
the
time
sanjay
parthasarathy
become
a
big
influence
in
my
life
and
career
although
we
have
not
know
each
other
in
india
sanjay
do
play
cricket
under
my
own
school
captain
for
south
zone
in
u
s
at
microsoft
we
hit
it
off
immediately
the
combination
of
cricket
and
technology
meant
we
never
ran
out
of
thing
to
talk
about
he
told
me
that
i
must
internalize
for
myself
the
belief
that
the
sky
be
the
limit
i
must
work
hard
not
to
climb
the
ladder
but
to
do
important
work
with
benefit
of
hindsight
i
know
now
that
anyone
who
feel
like
an
outsider
can
be
successful
but
it
require
both
an
enlighten
management
and
a
dedicate
employee
a
manager
can
be
demand
but
must
also
have
the
empathy
to
figure
out
what
will
motivate
employee
likewise
an
employee
be
right
to
put
his
or
her
head
down
and
work
hard
but
they
also
have
the
right
to
expect
a
pathway
to
great
responsibility
and
recognition
when
they
do
there
must
be
balance
because
of
my
own
experience
and
by
learn
from
my
colleague
i
get
now
how
hard
it
be
to
join
a
company
that
doesn
t
look
like
you
and
to
live
in
a
community
where
most
of
your
neighbor
don
t
look
like
you
how
do
you
identify
role
model
you
can
fully
relate
to
how
do
you
find
mentor
coach
and
sponsor
who
can
help
you
succeed
without
hiding
your
true
self
at
work
the
tech
industry
include
microsoft
be
simply
not
as
diverse
as
we
must
become
and
outside

can
also
feel
isolated

in

provide
a
much
need
safe
space
for
member
to
air
fear
and
concern
we
all
want
a
culture
in
which
we
re
heard
and
support

i
say
earlier
that
culture
can
be
a
vague
amorphous
term
that
s
why
we
work
so
carefully
to
define
the
culture
we
want
and
it
s
why
we
measure
everything
when
it
come
to
human
data
be
not
perfect
but
we
can
t
monitor
what
we
can
t
measure
so
we
routinely
survey
employee
to
take
their
pulse
after
three
year
of
intensive
focus
on
culture
building
we
begin
to
see
some
encourage
result
employee
told
us
they
felt
the
company
be
head
in
the
right
direction
they
felt
we
be
make
the
right
choice
for
long
term
success
and
they
saw
different
group
across
the
company
work
together
more
this
be
exactly
what
we
be
hop
for
but
we
also
saw
some
trend
that
be
not
as
encourage
when
ask
whether
their
vice
president
or
group
leader
be
prioritize
talent
movement
and
development
the
result
be
bad
than
they
d
be
before
our
culture
building
project
begin
even
the
most
optimistic
worker
will
become
discourage
if
they
be
not
be
developed
i
have
set
a
clear
mission
and
envision
an
empower
culture
employee
and
senior
leader
be
on
board
but
we
have
a
miss
link
middle
management
this
be
a
bit
dishearten
but
in
retrospect
it
be
completely
understandable
remember
what
i
say
about
the
aperture
of
those
colleague
sit
in
the
darken
theater
in
orlando
the
opening
through
which
a
middle
manager
can
see
the
organizational
culture
in
the
midst
of
his
or
her
daily
work
be
a
crack
when
compare
with
the
panoramic
view
a
ceo
enjoys
a
harvard
business
review
survey
found
that
senior
leader
inside
company
spend
less
than
percent
of
their
time
develop
high
potential
leader
if
even
top
executive
cannot
find
the
time
to
unlock
employee
potential
the
growth
path
for
most
corporate
team
member
look
pretty
static
after
review
the
result
i
seize
on
an
upcoming
meeting
with
about
of
my
top
leader
to
tell
a
few
story
and
to
share
my
expectation
with
them
first
off
i
told
them
about
an
anonymous
microsoft
manager
who
have
come
to
me
recently
to
share
how
much
he
love
the
new
growth
mindset
and
how
much
he
want
to
see
more
of
it
point
out
hey
satya
i
know
these
five
people
who
don
t
have
a
growth
mindset
the
guy
be
just
use
growth
mindset
to
find
a
new
way
to
complain
about
others
that
be
not
what
we
have
in
mind
i
told
these
high
potential
leader
that
once
you
become
a
vice
president
a
partner
in
this
endeavor
the
whine
be
over
you
can
t
say
the
coffee
around
here
be
bad
or
there
aren
t
enough
good
people
or
i
didn
t
get
the
bonus
to
be
a
leader
in
this
company
your
job
be
to
find
the
rise
petal
in
a
field
of
shit
perhaps
not
my
best
line
of
poetry
but
i
want
these
people
to
stop
see
all
the
thing
that
be
hard
and
start
see
thing
that
be
great
and
help
others
see
them
too
constraint
be
real
and
will
always
be
with
us
but
leader
be
the
champion
of
overcome
constraint
they
make
thing
happen
every
organization
will
say
it
differently
but
for
me
there
be
three
expectation
three
leadership
principle
for
anyone
lead
others
at
microsoft
the
first
be
to
bring
clarity
to
those
you
work
with
this
be
one
of
the
foundational
thing
leader
do
every
day
every
minute
in
order
to
bring
clarity
you
ve
get
to
synthesize
the
complex
leader
take
internal
and
external
noise
and
synthesize
a
message
from
it
recognize
the
true
signal
within
a
lot
of
noise
i
don
t
want
to
hear
that
someone
be
the
smartest
person
in
the
room
i
want
to
hear
them
take
their
intelligence
and
use
it
to
develop
deep
share
understand
within
team
and
define
a
course
of
action
second
leader
generate
energy
not
only
on
their
own
team
but
across
the
company
it
s
insufficient
to
focus
exclusively
on
your
own
unit
leader
need
to
inspire
optimism
creativity
share
commitment
and
growth
through
time
good
and
bad
they
create
an
environment
where
everyone
can
do
his
or
her
best
work
and
they
build
organization
and
team
that
be
strong
tomorrow
than
today
third
and
finally
they
find
a
way
to
deliver
success
to
make
thing
happen
this
mean
drive
innovation
that
people
love
and
be
inspire
to
work
on
find
balance
between
long
term
success
and
short
term
win
and
be
boundary
less
and
globally
mind
in
seek
solution
i
love
these
three
leadership
principle
the
heart
of
my
message
change
the
culture
at
microsoft
doesn
t
depend
on
me
or
even
on
the
handful
of
top
leader
i
work
most
closely
with
it
depends
on
everyone
in
the
company
include
our
vast
cadre
of
middle
manager
who
must
dedicate
themselves
to
make
everyone
they
work
with
well
every
day
i
totally
empathize
with
other
leader
and
see
my
job
as
help
them
become
even
well
leadership
can
be
a
lonely
business
it
can
also
be
a
noisy
place
when
a
leader
step
into
the
arena
especially
in
today
s
loud
echo
chamber
of
social
medium
he
or
she
can
be
tempt
to
make
decision
that
will
result
in
instant
gratification
but
we
have
to
look
beyond
the
temporal
discounting
what
someone
will
write
in
this
moment
s
tweet
or
tomorrow
s
news
reason
judgment
and
inner
conviction
be
what
i
expect
from
myself
and
from
the
leader
around
me
make
the
call
but
don
t
expect
consensus
internally
we
need
to
have
strong
partnership
between
leader
across
the
company
among
team
but
that
same
growth
mindset
be
need
externally
too
the
competitive
landscape
have
shift
seismically
over
the
previous
decade
and
now
new
and
surprising
partnership
with
friend
and
former
enemy
be
need
chapter
friend
or
frenemies
build
partnership
before
you
need
them
there
be
an
audible
gasp
and
more
than
a
smatter
of
chuckle
in
the
auditorium
when
i
reach
into
my
suit
jacket
and
pull
out
an
iphone
no
one
in
recent
memory
have
see
a
microsoft
ceo
show
off
an
apple
product
especially
not
at
a
competitor
s
sale
conference
this
be
a
pretty
unique
iphone
i
told
attendee
at
salesforce

event
as
the
crowd
quiet
down
salesforce
both
competes
and
partner
with
microsoft
in
online
service
i
like
to
call
it
the
iphone
pro
because
it
s
get
all
the
microsoft
software
and
application
on

refresh
microsoft
versus
apple
have
be
such
a
prominent
and
even
contentious
rivalry
that
people
forget
we
ve
be
building
software
for
the
mac
since
today
one
of
my
top
priority
be
to
make
sure
that
our
billion
customer
no
matter
which
phone
or
platform
they
choose
to
use
have
their
need
met
so
that
we
continue
to
grow
to
do
that
sometimes
we
have
to
bury
the
hatchet
with
old
rival
pursue
surprising
new
partnership
and
revive
longstanding
relationship
over
the
year
we
ve
developed
the
maturity
to
become
more
obsess
with
customer
need
thereby
learn
to
coexist
and
compete
in
the
previous
chapter
i
write
about
the
importance
of
building
the
right
culture
healthy
partnership
often
difficult
but
always
mutually
beneficial
be
the
natural
and
much
need
product
of
the
culture
we
re
building
steve

help
me
deeply
understand
this
with
his
three
c
imagine

the

ring

microsoft
apple

may
have

be
that
enough
an
organization
may
have
a
conceptual
vision
a
dream
or
imagination
fill
with
new
idea
and
new
approach
but
do
they
have
what

in
the
second
ring
capability
do
they
have
the
engineering
and
design
skill
require
to
actually
build
that

alone
and
finally
the

be
a

that
embrace

doesn

concept
be
well
and
capability
more
comprehensive
when
the
culture
invite
partner
to
the
table
two
or
more
head
really
be
well
than
one
a
few
year
back
apple
have
a
concept
they
felt
would
benefit
from
a
renew
partnership
with
our
capability
and
culture
shortly
after
become
ceo
i
decide
we
need
to
get
office
everywhere
include
io
and
android
we
have
these
version
in
the
work
for
some
time
just
wait
for
the
right
moment
to
launch
i
want
unambiguously
to
declare
both
internally
and
externally
that
the
strategy
would
be
to
center
our
innovation
agenda
around
user
need
and
not
simply
their
device
we
announce
that
we
would
bring
office
to
io
in
march
two
month
into
my
new
role
soon
apple
sent
a
cryptic
note
to
our
office
team
ask
for
an
engineer
to
sign
a
nondisclosure
agreement
and
come
to
cupertino
for
a
meeting
this
be
standard
operating
procedure
in
our
secretive
industry
where
intellectual
property
must
be
guard
after
a
few
meeting
it
become
clear
that
what
apple
want
be
for
microsoft
to
work
with
them
to
optimize
office
for
their
new
ipad
pro
apple
told
us
that
they
felt
there
be
a
new
openness
at
microsoft
they
trust
us
and
want
us
to
be
part
of
their
launch
event
there
be
passionate
debate
internally
about
whether
this
be
a
good
idea
at
first
some
product
line
leader
within
microsoft
felt
uneasy
about
partner
with
their
competitor
i
definitely
heard
some
resistance
behind
close
door
one
way
to
explain
the
logic
be
by
turn
to
game
theory
which
us
mathematical
model
to
explain
cooperation
and
conflict
partner
be
too
often
see
as
a
zero
sum
game
whatever
be
gain
by
one
participant
be
lose
by
another
i
don
t
see
it
that
way
when
do
right
partner
grows
the
pie
for
everyone
for
customer
yes
but
also
for
each
of
the
partner
ultimately
the
consensus
be
that
this
partnership
with
apple
would
help
to
ensure
office
s
value
be
available
to
everyone
and
apple
be
commit
to
make
its
io
really
show
off
the
great
thing
office
can
do
which
would
far
solidify
microsoft
as
the
top
developer
for
apple
on
launch
day
apple
s
senior
vice
president
for
worldwide
marketing
phil
schiller
tease
the
audience
as
he
set
up
the
next
demo
at
the
ipad
pro
launch
we
ve
be
lucky
to
have
some
developer
come
in
to
work
with
us
on
professional
productivity
who
know
productivity
more
than
microsoft
nervous
laughter
fill
the
room
yeah
these
guy
know
productivity
kirk
koenigsbauer
the
head
of
office
marketing
take
the
stage
to
proclaim
that
more
than
ever
we
be
do
great
work
for
the
ipad
but
the
publicity
value
of
work
with
old
rival
be
far
down
on
my
list
of
motivation
for
pursue
them
sure
people
like
to
hear
about
competitor
get
along
but
forge
great
business
partnership
be
too
difficult
if
pr
be
the
sole
purpose
for
me
partnership
particularly
with
competitor
have
to
be
about
strengthen
a
company
s
core
business
which
ultimately
center
on
create
additional
value
for
the
customer
for
a
platform
company
that
mean
do
new
thing
with
competitor
that
can
accrue
value
back
to
one
of
the
platform
sometimes
that
mean
work
with
old
rival
and
sometimes
it
mean
forge
surprising
new
partnership
we
work
with
google
for
example
to
make
it
possible
for
office
to
work
on
their
android
platform
we
partner
with
facebook
to
make
all
of
their
application
work
universally
across
window
product
and
likewise
to
help
them
make
our
minecraft
game
application
work
on
their
oculus
rift
a
virtual
reality
device
that
competes
for
attention
with
our
own
hololens
similarly
we
re
work
with
apple
to
enable
customer
to
well
manage
their
iphones
within
an
enterprise
and
we
re
work
with
red
hat
a
linux
platform
that
competes
with
window
so
that
enterprise
built
on
red
hat
can
use
our
azure
cloud
to
scale
up
globally
by
take
advantage
of
investment
we
ve
make
in
local
data
center
around
the
world
our
partnership
with
red
hat
may
not
be
as
surprising
to
some
as
our
work
with
apple
and
google
but
when
i
stood
onstage
with
a
slide
just
over
my
shoulder
proclaim
microsoft
linux
one
analyst
conclude
that
hell
must
have
frozen
over
partnership
like
these
can
exist
at
time
uneasily
with
competitor
in
specific
product
or
service
category
we
compete
vigorously
with
amazon
in
the
cloud
market
there
s
no
ambiguity
about
that
but
why
can
t
microsoft
and
amazon
partner
in
other
area
for
example
bing
power
the
search
experience
on
amazon
fire
tablet
we
have
to
face
reality
when
we
have
a
great
product
like
bing
office
or
cortana
but
someone
else
have
create
a
strong
market
position
with
their
service
or
device
we
can
t
just
sit
on
the
sideline
we
have
to
find
smart
way
to
partner
so
that
our
product
can
become
available
on
each
others
popular
platform
in
today
s
era
of
digital
transformation
every
organization
and
every
industry
be
potential
partner
consider
the
taxi
and
entertainment
industry
ninety
percent
of
uber
rider
wait
less
than
ten
minute
for
a
driver
compare
with
percent
of
taxi
rider
netflix
cost
its
viewer
per
hour
of
entertainment
compare
with
per
hour
with
the
old
blockbuster
video
rental
model
these
be
some
of
the
high
visibility
example
of
digital
transformation
but
it
s
happen
in
every
industry
we
estimate
the
value
of
these
transformation
over
the
come
decade
to
be
about
trillion
company
be
focus
on
ensure
that
they
stay
relevant
and
competitive
by
embrace
this
transformation
and
we
want
microsoft
to
be
their
partner
to
do
so
there
be
four
initiative
every
company
must
make
a
priority
the
first
be
engage
their
customer
base
by
leverage
data
to
improve
the
customer
experience
second
they
must
empower
their
own
employee
by
enable
great
and
more
mobile
productivity
and
collaboration
in
the
new
digital
world
of
work
third
they
must
optimize
operation
automate
and
simplify
business
process
across
sale
operation
and
finance
fourth
they
must
transform
their
product
service
and
business
model
every
company
be
become
a
digital
company
and
that
process
begin
with
infuse
their
product
with
intelligence
expert
estimate
between
billion
connect
thing
will
be
in
use
by
present
a
significant
opportunity
for
company
to
drive
their
own
digital
transformation
ge
have
become
a
full
blown
digital
company
with
its
predix
platform
which
partner
with
microsoft
to
connect
industrial
equipment
analyze
data
from
those
machine
and
deliver
real
time
insight
toyota
have
a
connect
auto
division
that
have
transform
their
car
and
truck
into
next
generation
digital
era
vehicle
move
digital
platform
that
enable
car
to
communicate
with
other
car
and
even
with
the
city
s
infrastructure
roll
royce
be
design
their
engine
as
big
data
platform
to
predict
failure
and
minimize
breakdown
our
emphasis
on
strategic
partnership
isn
t
really
new
it
s
actually
another
example
of
how
we
have
be
rediscover
the
soul
of
microsoft
when
i
look
at
our
founder
paul
allen
clearly
saw
the
power
of
new
computer
and
bill
gate
saw
the
power
of
software
together
they
be
able
to
create
magic
and
more
importantly
democratize
compute
i
sometimes
wonder
if
bill
and
paul
have
not
succeed
with
microsoft
what
would
the
world
look
like
would
we
have
independent
hardware
manufacturer
independent
software
vendor
system
integrator
and
others
our
original
business
model
be
built
on
an
ecosystem
of
partner
independent
software
developer
like
adobe
and
autodesk
video
game
maker
like
ea
sport
hardware
manufacturer
like
dell
hp
and
lenovo
and
retailer
like
best
buy
i
don
t
think
google
would
have
exist
but
for
the
pc
browser
microsoft
enable
google
to
build
a
toolbar
for
our
internet
explorer
make
google
service
more
visible
and
accessible
as
a
result
of
these
and
other
partnership
microsoft
and
the
pc
help
nurture
a
host
of
billion
dollar
company
and
microsoft
attract
million
of
additional
customer
in
the
process
when
i
become
ceo
i
sense
we
have
forgotten
how
our
talent
for
partnership
be
a
key
to
what
make
us
great
it
s
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
happen
to
any
great
company
success
can
cause
people
to
unlearn
the
habit
that
make
them
successful
in
the
first
place
we
knew
we
need
to
retrain
our
partnership
muscle
we
have
to
look
anew
at
our
industry
and
find
way
to
add
value
for
our
customer
whether
they
be
on
an
apple
device
a
linux
platform
or
an
adobe
product
fortunately
this
instinct
be
part
of
my
dna
my
very
first
job
at
microsoft
in
be
all
about
partner
we
be
building
window
nt
a
bit
operating
system
but
most
of
the
backend
application
that
we
need
to
become
viable
have
be
built
for
unix
base
minicomputer
not
window
and
so
my
task
as
a
young
window
nt
technical
evangelist
be
to
move
those
application
onto
the
pc
architecture
lack
credibility
as
a
serious
enterprise
player
microsoft
have
to
do
a
lot
of
hard
work
just
to
be
consider
we
built
prototype
of
application
for
our
pc
platform
and
then
take
them
to
customer
in
manufacturing
retail
and
health
care
to
show
them
that
their
big
robust
minicomputer
apps
really
could
run
just
as
well
on
a
pc
maybe
even
well
they
be
surprised
to
see
their
mission
critical
apps
work
with
a
graphical
user
interface
on
a
device
they
d
thought
of
as
a
toy
i
can
distinctly
remember
one
of
our
first
design
win
in
retail
point
of
sale
device
be
ubiquitous
and
a
lucrative
market
for
technology
but
there
be
no
software
standard
to
ensure
that
the
cash
register
the
scanner
and
other
retail
peripheral
would
all
work
together
with
the
backend
accounting
and
inventory
system
so
my
colleague
and
i
write
up
the
standard
and
the
spec
that
make
it
possible
for
window
to
enter
the
point
of
sale
market
we
start
with
nothing
but
built
up
a
major
enterprise
business
to
be
sure
partner
have
its
challenge
even
with
longstanding
partner
sometimes
we
have
to
revive
old
relationship
take
dell
for
example
which
over
the
year
have
ship
hundred
of
million
of
window
computer
in
when
microsoft
decide
for
the
first
time
to
design
and
produce
its
own
line
of
hardware
the
surface
series
we
morph
from
pure
partner
into
something
murkier
a
partner
and
a
direct
competitor
then
to
make

in
the

reputation

but
i
wasn
t
personally
engage
in
the

in
fact
back
then
i
be
beg
for

to
work
with
us
on
our
fledgling
server
business
a
job
that
demand
an
attitude
of
humility
rather
than
one
of
hubris
one
lesson
i
learn
from
the
antitrust
case
there
be
many
lesson
be
to
compete

and
then
equally
celebrate
the
opportunity
we
create
for
everyone
it
s
not
a
zero
sum
game
i
ve
take
that
to
heart
google
today
be
a
dominant
company
in
our
industry
for
year
we
ve
compete
in
the
marketplace
while
also
feud
through
nonstop
complaint
to
government
regulator
in
the
united
state
and
abroad
as
ceo
i
decide
to
turn
the
page
on
that
strategy
reason
that
it
be
time
to
end
our
regulatory
battle
and
focus
all
of
our
energy
on

in
the
cloud
sundar
pichai
google
s
ceo
be
a
competitor
who
i
also
count
as
a
friend
after
a
series
of
very
productive
discussion
and
thoughtful
negotiation
between
our
two
organization
lead
by
brad
smith
microsoft
s
president
and
chief
legal
officer
sundar
and
i
surprised
observer
of
the
rivalry
with
a
joint
statement
our
company
compete
vigorously
but
we
want
to
do
so
on
the
merit
of
our
product
not
in
legal
proceeding
in
push
this
change
of
attitude
i
ve
be
help
by
the
simple
fact
that
i
be
a
fresh
face
new
blood
lose
the
baggage
of
history
make
it
easy
for
me
to
break
down
old
wall
of
mistrust
but
will
it
be
enough

early
in
my
tenure
as
ceo
i
decide
i
need
to
talk
with
peggy
johnson
who
have
be
do
an
amaze
job
at
manage
partnership
and
business
development
at
qualcomm
a
semiconductor
and
wireless
telecom
company
base
in
san
diego
i
call
her
up
one
saturday
afternoon
at
her
home
in
the
san
diego
area
and
ask
her
whether
she
would
consider
join
microsoft
i
could
tell
that
she
be
skeptical
and
even
felt
a
little
disloyal
have
the
conversation
i
manage
to
persuade
peggy
to
meet
me
for
dinner
in
silicon
valley
walk
into
the
four
season
hotel
for
our
meeting
a
few
people
recognize
me
and
head
turn
with
more
than
a
little
curiosity
we
be
seat
at
a
quiet
table
and
soon
found
ourselves
talk
excitedly
about
ambient
intelligence
the
notion
that
more
and
more
object
in
our
home
office
and
other
space
will
automatically
recognize
our
human
presence
and
respond
to
our
preference
for
microsoft
to
successfully
lead
that
digital
transformation
would
take
new
untraditional
surprising
partnership
investment
and
acquisition
i
sense
that
peggy
be
hooked
on
that
vision
too
later
i
learn
that
she
d
call
her
husband
immediately
after
our
meal
to
persuade
him
that
redmond
washington
be
in
their
future
she
have
the
job
and
the
direction
to
help
make
silicon
valley
our
best
friend
peggy
s
ease
humility
and
passion
for
technology
impressed
me
these
be
just
the
quality
i
want
microsoft
to
convey
to
our
potential
business
partner
little
do
i
know
how
soon
those
attribute
would
be
call
into
action
one
of
our
major
partnership
goal
be
to
build
microsoft
application
for
compete
platform
like
google

android
operating
system
and
for
apple
s
io
we
need
to
have
our
apps
preloaded
on
phone
with
vary
operating
system
so
that
when
a
consumer
bought
a
phone
microsoft
apps
would
already
be
there
one
of
the
important
partner
we
need
to
work
with
on
this
front
be
samsung
the
korean
manufacturer
of
the
world
s
most
popular
android
smartphone
we
d
partner
with
samsung
for
more
than
thirty
year
but
in
the
summer

have
enter
into
an
agreement
to
license
some
of
microsoft

property
but
since
then
the
company
s
smartphone
sale
have
quadruple
and
its
android
phone
be
now
the
bestselling
in
the
world
after
microsoft
announce

division
of
nokia
the
finnish

so
upset
that
he
refuse
to
meet
with
anyone
from
microsoft
the
partnership
be
sharply
tilt
toward
litigation
we
work
to
get
peggy
up
to
speed
on
the
samsung
relationship
she
read
document
from
both
side
ask
good
question
and
offer
creative
idea
about
how
we
might
resolve
our
difference
fortunately
for
us
peggy
have
developed
a
great
relationship
with
j
k
he
agree
to
meet
with
her
she
and
a
team
from
business
development
and
legal
journeyed
to
his
office
in
seoul
where
they
found
the
room
fill
with
people
know
for
their
tough
negotiation
style
peggy
and
the
team
work
to
demonstrate
respect
throughout
the
meeting
rather
than
make
demand
she
decide
instead
to
listen
reserve
judgment
and
seek
to
empathize
with
samsung
s
perspective
she
and
the
team
return
to
redmond
not
as
advocate
for
one
side
but
motivate
to
find
a
solution
in
the
middle
though
new
to
the
company
peggy
already
exemplify
the
culture
we
aspire
to
have
she
saw
what
be
possible
by
keep
a
growth
mindset
not
one
fix
on
point
finger
or
assign
blame
she
and
her
team
brought
everyone
to
the
table
demonstrate
what
diversity
and
inclusion
look
like
and
she
show
us
the
importance
of
get
out
of
our
headquarters
at
redmond
away
from
our
insular
comfortable
world
and
inside
that
of
our
partner
and
customer
in
the
end
we
still
have
to
resolve
some
of
our
issue
through
the
court
but
we
also
continued
to
show
respect
microsoft
value
and
respect
our
partnership
we
write
in
a
statement
unfortunately
even
partner
sometimes
disagree
today
microsoft
apps
be
popular
on
samsung
smartphones
window
power
samsung
tablet
and
its
ambition
for
the
far
flung
internet
of
thing
around
the
same
time
we
be
embroil
in
a
contentious
dispute
with
yahoo
which
use
the
bing
search
engine
as
its
exclusive
search
partner
microsoft
and
yahoo
share
in
the
revenue
from
the
search
perform
by
bing
but
as
with
samsung
our
relationship
with
yahoo
be
deteriorate
as
yahoo
s
business
model
come
under
pressure
and
lawsuit
be
be
threaten
yahoo
want
to
breach
its
contract
we
work
to
mend
the
relationship
not
by
present
a
list
of
demand
but
by
listen
empathize
with
a
partner
s
situation
and
explore
idea
in
the
end
we
decide
to
forgo
the
requirement
of
exclusivity
for
bing
as
yahoo
s
search
partner
the
issue
be
generate
too
much
needle
friction
between
the
two
party
and
we
be
confident
that
our
technology
and
our
partnership
would
prevail
we
avoid
costly
litigation
and
today
bing
continue
to
handle
the
majority
of
yahoo
s
search
these
experience
have
taught
us
a
lot
and
refresh
our
partner
spirit
microsoft
already
have
the
large
ecosystem
of
partner
in
the
world
hundred
of
thousand
of
company
worldwide
build
and
sell
solution
that
support
our
product
and
service
in
addition
million
of
customer
in
every
sector
have
built
their
business
and
organization
use
microsoft
technology
my
ultimate
goal
be
to
be
the
big
platform
provider
underneath
all
of
this
entrepreneurial
energy
with
an
unrelenting
focus
on
create
economic
opportunity
for
others
but
if
we
want
to
convince
million
of
new
company
around
the
world
to
bet
on
our
platform
we
need
to
start
by
earn
their
trust
in
chapter
i
will
explicitly
explore
the
notion
that
trust
be
built
by
be
consistent
over
time
it
s
built
by
be
clear
that
there
be
place
where
we
be
go
to
compete
to
be
best
in
class
and
there
be
place
where
we
can
work
together
to
add
value
for
each
other
s
customer
trust
have
many
other
component
as
well
respect
listen
transparency
stay
focus
and
be
willing
to
hit
reset
when
necessary
we
have
get
to
be
principled
about
it
partnership
be
journey
of
mutual
exploration
and
so
we
need
to
be
open
to
unexpected
synergy
and
fresh
way
to
collaborate
openness
begin
with
respect
respect
for
the
people
at
the
table
and
the
experience
they
bring
respect
for
the
other
company
and
its
mission
do
we
always
agree
of
course
not
but
we
always
seek
to
listen
intelligently
seek
to
understand
not
just
the
word
we
be
hearing
but
the
underlie
intention
i
try
hard
not
to
bring
needle
history
into
the
room
and
i
don
t
let
the
limitation
of
the
past
dictate
the
contour
of
the
future
over
the
year
i
ve
found
that
openness
be
the
best
way
to
get
thing
do
and
to
ensure
all
party
feel
terrific
about
the
outcome
in
a
world
where
innovation
be
continuous
and
rapid
no
one
have
time
to
waste
on
unnecessary
cycle
of
work
and
effort
be
straightforward
with
one
another
be
the
best
way
to
achieve
a
mutually
agreeable
outcome
in
the
fast
time
possible
when
complication
threaten
to
stymie
the
effort
to
build
a
partnership
it
help
to
stay
focus
on
long
term
goal
rather
than
be
distract
by
the
endless
opportunity
to
collaborate
and
the
numerous
question
they
raise
i
like
to
start
with
one
or
two
area
of
focus
once
company
can
work
together
successfully
then
they
can
tackle
the
next
set
of
idea
and
challenge
finally
don
t
be
afraid
to
take
a
pause
even
when
both
party
have
nothing
but
the
best
intention
thing
can
sometimes
go
sideways
and
may
even
come
to
a
standstill
sometimes
it
s
critical
to
look
at
an
exist
relationship
with
a
fresh
set
of
eye
a
strategy
that
fail
in
the
past
might
work
in
the
future
technology
change
the
business
environment
change
people
change
it
s
a
mistake
to
write
off
any
relationship
as
a
lose
cause
tomorrow
always
begin
with
a
chance
to
create
new
opportunity
this
approach
lead
to
real
breakthrough
in
our
partnership
with
a
standard
bearer
in
the
creative
world
adobe
a
pioneer
in
font
development
and
the
maker
of

and
many
other
product
love
by
artist
and
designer
adobe
be
built
on
window
but
we
compete
on
document
standard
and
over
the
year
in
spite
of
many
common
customer
we
simply
drift
apart

have
become
ceo
of
adobe
earlier
and
when
i
be
name
ceo
of
microsoft
our
two
company
begin
to
reengage
we
still
compete
in
area
of
overlap
but
we
have
a
much
deeper
partnership
in
which
adobe
s
creative
software
be
now
the
inspiration
for
new
microsoft
device
like
surface
studio
and
surface
hub
together
we
be
transform
what
artist
can
do
with
a
computer
and
we
ve
expand
beyond
the
creative
cloud
into
adobe
s
marketing
cloud
which
be
built
on
top
of
our
azure
platform
i
be
often
ask
when
be
a
partnership
appropriate
as
oppose
to
an
acquisition
the
answer
be
best
frame
as
another
question
can
we
create
more
value
for
customer
by
come
together
as
one
entity
or
as
two
in
my
experience
whether
we
re
talk
about
a
gigantic
acquisition
like
our
deal
to
purchase
the
social
network
linkedin
or
small
acquisition
like
those
of
app
developer
xamarin
acompli
and
mileiq
the
acquisition
that
succeed
generally
start
as
partnership
born
out
of
careful
analysis
of
customer
need
that
be
the
case
with
linkedin
which
microsoft
acquire
in
for
billion
one
of
the
large
such
deal
in
history
for
more
than
six
year
microsoft
and
linkedin
work
together
to
enable
our
one
billion
user
and
their
nearly
half
a
billion
member
the
venn
diagram
of
our
customer
would
overlap
percent
with
theirs
to
synchronize
contact
so
that
office
contact
be
available
in
linkedin
and
vice
versa
microsoft
make
its
technical
specification
available
so
that
linkedin
could
build
a
beautiful
app
for
window
and
partner
on
a
social
connector
that
enable
rich
connection
and
collaboration
across
both
platform
for
us
to
do
even
far
integration
and
create
more
compelling
scenario
and
value
for
our
customer
we
have
to
come
together
as
one
together
we
built
not
just
a
track
record
but
also
a
share
vision
and
mutual
trust
that
s
why
on
the
day
we
announce
the
acquisition
linkedin
s
ceo
jeff
weiner
explain
the
deal
to
technology
reporter
kara
swisher
by
say
you
look
at
how
microsoft
be
increasingly
become
more
agile
more
innovative
more
open
more
purpose
driven
and
that
played
a
big
role
in
this
go
back
to
my
day
as
an
engineer
i
ve
use
the
follow
mental
model
to
capture
how
i
manage
time
employee
customer
product
partner
each
element
need
time
attention
and
focus
if
i
m
go
to
create
the
value
for
which
i
be
ultimately
accountable
all
four
be
important
and
without
discipline
even
the
best
manager
can
overlook
one
or
more
employee
and
product
command
attention
every
day
as
they
be
closest
to
us
customer
provide
the
resource
we
need
to
do
anything
so
they
also
command
energy
but
partner
provide
the
lift
we
need
to
soar
they
help
us
see
around
corner
help
us
locate
new
opportunity
we
might
not
see
alone
since
become
a
ceo
i
now
recognize
there
be
many
more
constituent
in
this
constellation
government
and
community
for
example
be
critical
too
there
have
to
be
a
discipline
approach
in
which
all
of
these
player
see
the
value
of
a
company
of
its
product
and

maximize

originally
i
thought
of
this
book
as
a
collection
of
meditation
from
a
ceo
in
the
midst
of
transformation
as
someone
both
navigate
a
corporate
transformation
and
create
transformational
technology
my
aim
be
to
share
these
experience
in
real
time
rather
than
look
back
on
them
year
later
the
microsoft
transformation
of
course
be
ongoing
in
the
face
of
global
economic
and
technological
uncertainty
we
reset
our
mission
reprioritized
our
culture
and
built
or
rebuilt
strategic
partnership
in
order
to
solidify
the
foundation
of
our
business
we
also
need
to
hasten
our
innovative
spirit
and
place
new
bold
bet
this
be
what
have
make
microsoft
a
trust
tech
brand
for
more
than
forty
year
we
look
beyond
the
pc
and
the
server
to
drive
success
in
the
cloud
but
we
also
have
to
look
beyond
the
cloud
forecasting
technology
trend
can
be
perilous
it
s
be
say
we
tend
to
overestimate
what
we
can
achieve
in
the
short
run
but
underestimate
what
can
be
achieve
in
the
long
run
but
we
be
invest
to
lead
in
three
key
technology
that
will
shape
our
industry
and
others
in
the
year
to
come
mixed

artificial
intelligence
and
quantum
compute
these
technology
will
inevitably
lead
to
massive
shift
in
our
economy
and
society
in
the
final
three
chapter
of
this
book
i
ll
explore
the
value
ethic
policy
and
economics
we
need
to
consider
in
preparation
for
this
next
wave
here
be
one
way
to
think
about
the
convergence
of
these
come
technology
shift
with
mixed
reality
we
be
building
the
ultimate
compute
experience
one
in
which
your
field
of
view
becomes
a
compute
surface
and
the
digital
world
and
your
physical
world
become
one
the
data
apps
and
even
the
colleague
and
friend
you
think
of
as
be
on
your
phone
or
tablet
be
now
available
anywhere
you
want
to
access
them
while
you
re
work
in
your
office
visit
a
customer
or
collaborate
with
colleague
in
a
conference
room
artificial
intelligence
power
every
experience
augment
human
capability
with
insight
and
predictive
power
that
would
be
impossible
to
achieve
on
our
own
finally
quantum
compute
will
allow
us
to
go
beyond
the
bound
of
moore
s
law
the
observation
that
the
number
of
transistor
in
a
computer
chip
double
roughly
every
two
year
by
change
the
very
physic
of
compute
as
we
know
it
today
provide
the
computational
power
to
solve
the
world
s
big
and
most
complex
problem
mr
ai
and
quantum
may
be
independent
thread
today
but
they
be
go
to
come
together
we
re
bet
on
it
a
technology
company
that
miss
multiple
trend
like
these
will
inevitably
fall
behind
at
the
same
time
of
course
it
s
dangerous
to
chase
untested
future
technology
while
neglect
the
core
of
the
current
business
that
s
the
classic
innovator
s
dilemma
to
risk
exist
success
while
pursue
new
opportunity
historically
microsoft
have
struggle
at
time
to
get
this
balance
right
we
actually
have
a
tablet
before
the
ipad
we
be
well
along
the
path
toward
an
e
reader
before
the
kindle
but
in
some
case
our
software
be
ahead
of
the
key
component
require
for
success
such
as
touchscreen
hardware
or
broadband
connectivity
in
other
case
we
lack
end
to
end
design
think
to
bring
a
complete
solution
to
market
we
also
get
a
bit
overconfident
in
our
ability
to
fast
follow
a
competitor
forget
that
there
be
inherent
risk
in
such
a
strategy
we
be
perhaps
timid
in
disrupt
our
own
highly
successful
business
model
we
ve
learn
from
all
this
there
be
no
formula
to
invent
the
future
a
company
have
to
have
a
complete
vision
for
what
it
can
uniquely
do
and
then
back
it
up
with
conviction
and
the
capability
to
make
it
happen
i
have
decide
before
become
ceo
that
we
would
need
to
continue
to
invest
and
to
do
so
in
an
aggressive
and
more
focus
way
in
new
technology
and
new
market
but
only
if
we
could
satisfactorily
meet
our
three
c
do
we
have
an
excite
concept
do
we
have
the
capability
necessary
to
succeed
and
a
culture
that
welcome
these
new
idea
and
approach
to
avoid
be
trap
by
the
innovator
s
dilemma
and
to
move
from
always
focus
on
the
urgency
of
today
to
consider
the
important
thing
for
tomorrow
we
decide
to
look
at
our
investment
strategy
across
three
growth
horizon
first
grow
today
s
core
business
and
technology
second
incubate
new
idea
and
product
for
the
future
and
third
invest
in
long
term
breakthrough
on
horizon

our
customer
and
partner
will
continue
to

my

alex

have
be
perfect
a
prototype
of

for
some
time
alex
and
his

have
already
create
one
breakthrough
they

however
alex
s
hololens
project
have
bounce
around
the
company
in
search
of
continued
funding
it
be
unclear
whether
microsoft
would
invest
in
mixed
reality
a
new
business
in
an
unproven
market
the
quest
seem
so
ridiculous
at
time
that
alex
whimsically
code
name
the
project
baraboo
in
honor
of
a
town
in
wisconsin
that
be
home
to
a
circus
and
clown
museum
once
i
get
a
chance
to
see
what
hololens
could
do
i
be
sell
while
hololens
have
obvious
application
in
video
game
i
instantly
saw
its
potential
in
classroom
hospital
and
yes
space
exploration
nasa
be
in
fact
one
of
the
first
organization
to
see
the
value
of
hololens
adopt
an
early
version
to
enable
astronaut
on
earth
to
collaborate
with
astronaut
in
space
if
anyone
be
on
the
fence
after
the
mar
demonstration
bill
gate
s
email
after
his
experience
convince
even
the
most
skeptical
i
be
very
impressed
with
thing
about
the
mar
demo
first
the
fidelity
be
very
good
the
image
look
real
and
when
i
move
my
head
it
felt
real
i
felt
like
i
be
there
second
the
ability
to
move
physically
around
the
space
be
quite
natural
while
use
peripheral
vision
to
avoid
hit
anything
although
i
be
still
not
sure
what
application
will
take
off
the
late
demo
really
have
me
enthuse
about
the
project
and
that
we
will
find
a
way
to
make
this
a
success
i
have
be
convert
yes
alex
we
ll
invest
to
understand
the
soul
of
hololens
it
help
to
understand
alex
and
his
past
in
some
way
our
story
have
a
lot
in
common
the
son
of
a
career
government
diplomat
in
brazil
alex
move
around
a
lot
as
a
kid
and
found
that
math
science
and
eventually
computer
be
his
only
consistent
companion
if
you
know
how
to
paint
with
math
and
science
you
can
make
anything
he
once
told
me
his
parent
bought
him
an
atari
home
video
console
that
he
broke
repeatedly
but
eventually
learn
to
program
his
passion
for
technology
lead
him
to
the
rochester
institute
of
technology
an
internship
with
nasa
and
later
highly
sophisticated
computer
program
role
in
silicon
valley
his
quest
however
be
to
find
a
place
where
he
could
design
software
for
the
sake
of
software
a
place
that
treat
software
as
an
art
form
he
come
to
microsoft
where
he
would
play
a
role
in
design
window
vista
the
long
await
successor
to
window
xp
when
vista
receive
lukewarm
review
despite
its
advanced
feature
no
one
be
more
disappointed
than
alex
he
take
it
personally
and
return
to
brazil
to
reflect
to
hit
refresh
on
his
own
career
outlook
alex
be
very
philosophical
and
turn
to
nietzsche
for
direction
he
who
have
a
why
to
live
for
can
bear
almost
any
how
alex
be
upset
with
himself
because
he
do
not
yet
have
his
why
a
point
of
view
about
where
compute
should
be
head
he
would
later
tell
journalist
kevin
dupzyk
that
he
visit
a
farm
on
brazil
s
eastern
shore
wander
around
with
a
notebook
and
ponder
the
contribution
he
want
to
make
to
compute
he
begin
to
think
about
how
compute
could
displace
time
and
space
why
be
we
chain
to
keyboard
and
screen
why
can
t
i
use
my
computer
to
be
with
anyone
i
want
no
matter
where
they
be
alex
sense
that
the
evolution
of
compute
have
only
reach
the
equivalent
of
prehistoric
cave
painting
mr
be
to
become
a
new
paintbrush
that
would
create
an
entirely
new
compute
paradigm
alex
define
a
new
career
quest
for
himself
i
be
go
to
make
machine
that
perceive
the
real
world
perception
not
a
mouse
keyboard
and
screen
would
be
the
protagonist
of
his
story
machine
that
perceive
us
become
his
why
the
how
the
blueprint
become
to
build
a
new
compute
experience
design
around
sensor
that
can
perceive
human
their
environment
and
the
object
around
them
this
new
compute
experience
must
enable
three
kind
of
interaction
the
ability
to
input
analog
data
the
ability
to
output
digital
data
and
the
ability
to
feel
or
touch
data
something
know
as
haptics
kinect
be
the
first
step
in
this
journey
it
checked
the
box
for
a
human
to
provide
input
to
a
computer
simply
by
move
suddenly
we
could
dance
with
a
computer
now
hololens
be
check
multiple
box
it
enables
human
the
environment
and
object
to
give
and
receive
input
and
output
across
time
and
space
suddenly
an
astronaut
on
earth
can
inspect
a
crater
on
mar
the
final
piece
the
haptics
will
include
the
ability
to
touch
and
feel
when
we
dance
use
kinect
or
reach
for
a
rock
use
hololens
we
cannot
yet
feel
our
dance
partner
or
that
rock
but
one
day
we
will
today
our
focus
at
microsoft
be
to
democratize
mixed
reality
to
make
it
available
to
everyone
our
launch
of
hololens
have
be
base
on
a
proven
strategy
for
microsoft
invite
outside
developer
to
help
us
create
imaginative
application
for
the
hololens
platform
soon
after
we
announce
hololens
more
than
five
thousand
developer
submit
idea
for
application
they
want
to
build
we
ran
a
twenty
four
hour
twitter
poll
to
ask
which
idea
we
should
build
first
developer
and
fan
chose
galaxy

which
enables
you
to
look

move
through
it
at
your

annotate
what
you
see

craft
tremendously
useful
new
application
for
hololens
lowe
s
home
improvement
store
for
example
be
use
hololens
to
allow
their
customer
to
stand
in
their
own
kitchen
and
bathroom
and
superimpose
hologram
of

so
they
can
see
exactly
what
their
remodel
will
look
like
the
trajectory
of
this
technology
begin
with
simply
track
what
the
machine
be

but
someday
will
completely
understand
more
complex
task
which
we
ll
learn
about
as
we
get
to
artificial

give
a

may
help
machine
empathize
with

through
these

we
will
be
able
increasingly
to

we

manage
to

then
accomplish
the
other
task
on
its
own
it
not
only
could
explain
the
photograph
but
it
be
also
able
to
draw
a
circle
around
every

and
produce
an

sentence
that

i
believe
that
in
ten
year
ai

will
be
well

just
because
a

mean
it
can
truly
learn

understand
the

his

to
free
up
his

you
enter
the

immediately
notice
you
calculates
your

that
an

you
get
off
the

a

that

it

the

also
machine

our

for
example
found
that
if
we
train
a

to
speak
english
learn
spanish

become

he
knew
that

we
begin
with

highly
specialized
version
of
the

that
speak
the

professional
talk
and
then
after
a
period

in

we

something

more
important
be
at

who
we
be

in

just
before

i
be
visit

then
our

scott

effort
in

to
ensure
we
could
stand
up
to

we
remain
in
continuous

via

with
engineer
who
gather
in
a
makeshift
war
room
on

for
all
of
us
it
be
about
take
a
principled
stand
and
be
prepared
on
christmas
eve
i
write
to
our
board
of
director
i
ve
conclude
that
be
bold
in
support
the
right
of
american
citizen
to
exercise
their
constitutional
right
be
consistent
with
microsoft
s
core
purpose
business
and
value
i
also
assure
the
board
that
we
would
be
on
high
alert
and
so
those
same
security
engineer
who
d
warn
us
of
the
risk
give
up
their
holiday
vacation
with
family
to
work
around
the
clock
devise
a
plan
that
would
enable
us
to
safely
release
the
film
we
have
breakthrough
and
setback
but
ultimately
we
link
arm
and
release
the
film
christmas
day
with
great
success
on
our
xbox
video
platform
the
experience
be
intense
and
could
have
lead
to
disastrous
consequence
but
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
what
s
become
clear
be
that
the
world
need
a
digital
geneva
convention
a
broader
multilateral
agreement
that
affirms
cybersecurity
norm
as
global
rule
just
as
the
world
s
government
come
together
in
to
adopt
the
fourth
geneva
convention
to
protect
civilian
in
time
of
war
this
digital
agreement
would
commit
government
to
implement
the
norm
that
have
be
developed
to
protect
civilian
on
the
internet
in
time
of
peace
such
a
convention
should
commit
government
to
avoid
cyberattacks
that
target
the
private
sector
or
critical
infrastructure
or
the
use
of
hack
to
steal
intellectual
property
similarly
it
should
require
that
government
assist
private
sector
effort
to
detect
contain
respond
to
and
recover
from
these
event
and
should
mandate
that
government
report
vulnerability
to
vendor
rather
than
stockpile
sell
or
exploit
them
in
retrospect
our
preparation
for
defend
our
company
value
and
building
trust
in
the
face
of
an
international
crisis
have
begin
with
a
very
public
challenge
that
have
occur
just
over
a

earlier

come
into

now
at
my
door
as

work
closely
with
our
entire
senior

team
in
the
first

of
the

we
issue
a

by

if

this
be
the

limit
the
authority
of

great
oversight

advocate
for
transparency
about

demand
for

and
highlight
the
need
for
government
to
respect
the
free
flow
of
information
we
also
ask
government
to
avoid
conflict
among
themselves
which
can
create
a
tangle
of
contradictory
requirement
that
make
it
almost
impossible
for

to
fully

our
recommendation
be
driven
by
the
value
of
freedom
of

and
individual
privacy
but
also
by
hard
nose
economic
and
business
concern
we
make
the
case
that
government
can
best
support
a
grow
global
economy
by
avoid
policy
that
inhibit
or
discourage
access
by
company
or
individual
to
information
store
outside
their
country
inside
microsoft
we
mobilize
to
do
what
we
could
to
far
protect
the
security
of
the
data
entrust
to
us
we
move
quickly
to
expand
encryption
across
all
of
our
service
and
enhance
the
transparency
of
our
software
code
which
help
reassure
our
customer
that
our
product
do
not
contain
so
call
backdoor
that
would
enable
government
or
anyone
else
to
access
their
data
i
go
to
work
on
the
decision
to
reengineer
our
data
center
which
require
an
enormous
investment
of
new
resource
but
again
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
although
the
federal
government
in
our
view
be
take
a
strident
position
president
obama
remain
open
to
hearing
other
point
of
view
in
the
closing
month
of
brad
and
other
industry
representative
met
privately
with
the
president
to
make
our
case
negotiation
with
the
government
begin
and
on
january
on
the
eve
of
a
presidential
announcement
make
change
to
nsa
surveillance
we
receive
a
call
from
the
justice
department
say
that
they
would
settle
our
case
on
more
favorable
term
the
follow
month
president
obama
agree
for
the
first
time
to
permit
tech
company
to
more
fully
disclose
information
about
legal
order
issue
by
u
s
national
security
press
report
and
public
debate
about
the
role
of
tech
company
in
safeguard
data
security
become
more
accurate
and
well
inform
but
while
we
appreciate
the
president
s
effort
we
continued
to
insist
that
more
work
need
to
be
do
to
reform
policy
relate
to
government
access
to
data
we
be
not
yet
out
of
the
wood
just
a
few
month
earlier
in
december
u
s
prosecutor
order
microsoft
to
turn
over
data
from
the
email
account
of
an
individual
as
part
of
a
narcotic
case
the
data
be
store
on
a
microsoft
server
locate
in
a
company
facility
in
dublin
ireland
here
again
we
be
confront
with
tension
between
public
and
private
responsibility
in
this
case
the
understandable
desire
of
prosecutor
to
protect
public
safety
by
punish
criminal
and
our
own
duty
to
stand
up
for
individual
privacy
and
freedom
of
speech
somehow
we
need
to
maintain
the
trust
of
both
government
partner
and
our
customer
after
careful
consideration
microsoft
ask
a
federal
district
court
to
quash
the
government
s
order
we
contend
that
an
american
company
could
not
be
require
to
turn
over
information
locate
in
an
irish
data
center
since
american
law
do
not
apply
there
as
an
editorial
support
our
position
in
the
new
york
time
explain
if
the
united
state
could
require
a
company
to
turn
over
information
in
ireland
what
s
to
prevent
a
brazilian
agency
from
order
american
company
do
business
in
rio
to
turn
over
information
store
in
san
francisco
litigation
of
this
kind
be
costly
but
we
need
to
push
back

apple

once

microsoft
face
a
difficult
decision
one
that
weigh
heavily
on
me
personally
i
have
relative
who
have
work
in
law
enforcement
and
i
understand
the
need
to
obtain
evidence
to
protect
public
safety
in
many
case
the
safety
of
our
customer
with
public
anxiety
about
terrorism
run
high
it
would
have
be
easy
for
microsoft
to
support
the
government
s
position
or
simply
distance
itself
from
the
debate
in
the
end
however
microsoft
join
many
of
its
fiercest
competitor
in
support
apple
in
its
legal
battle
we
do
so
out
of
share
concern
about
the
potential
ramification
of
the
case
for
technology
and
for
our
customer
generally
speak
there
be
no
question
that
backdoor
be
a
bad
thing
they
lead
to
weaken
security
and
heighten
distrust
so
to
deliberately
design
a
backdoor
to
facilitate
access
to
someone
s
personal
data
would
be
a
dangerous
thing
at
the
same
time
we
recognize
that
the
solution
to
this
problem
be
too
important
to
be
left
to
a
bunch
of
tech
ceo
so
we
also
call
for
a
multi
constituent
body
to
debate
the
problem
and
work
toward
a
real
legislative
solution
one
that
protects
security
while
also
allow
for
law
enforcement
access
when
appropriate
get
the
proper
balance
be
essential
it
s
easy
to
be
a
zealot
for
one
value
or
the
other
but
that
doesn
t
make
it
right
individual
care
as
much
about
their
safety
as
their
privacy
company
also
care
about
both
since
security
and
trust
be
both
essential
to
economic
growth
and
a
global
solution
be
necessary
because
country
be
not
isolated
without
a

international

no

out
the

in

to
expect
silicon

enlist
as

tool
in
the

a
little

be

each
of
these
high
profile
case
sony
snowden
san

the

between

individual
liberty
of
privacy
and
free
speech
and
civil
society
requirement
like
public
safety
this
conflict
creates
a
moral
or
ethical
dilemma
one
which
of
course
have
be
debate
throughout
history
philosopher
tom
beauchamp
defines
such
a
dilemma
as
a
circumstance
in
which
moral
obligation
demand
or
appear
to
demand
that
a
person
adopt
each
of
two
or
more
alternative
action
yet
the
person
cannot
perform
all
the
require
alternative
in
such
a
circumstance
some
evidence
indicates
that
an
act
be
morally
right
while
other
evidence
indicates
that
it
be
morally
wrong
but
the
evidence
or
strength
of
argument
on
both
side
be
inconclusive
unfortunately
that
sum
up
microsoft
s
situation
which
be
precisely
why
the
decision
that
i
face
as
ceo
and
that
we
face
as
an
organization
be
so
difficult
painful
and
controversial
the
ultimate
solution
to
the
privacy
versus
security
dilemma
be
to
ensure
trust
on
all
side
which
be
no
glib
line
customer
must
trust
that
we
will
protect
their
privacy
but
we
must
be
transparent
about
the
legal
condition
in
which
we
won
t
similarly
public
official
must
trust
that
we
can
be
count
on
to
help
them
protect
public
safety
so
long
as
the
rule
protect
individual
freedom
be
clear
and
follow
consistently
but
building
and
maintain
both
kind
of
trust
find
the
balance
between
individual
and
public
obligation
have
always
define
the
progress
of
institution
but
it
may
be
more
art
than
science
in
an
engage
ted
talk
the
british
conductor
charles
hazelwood
describes
the
critical
importance
of
trust
in
lead
an
orchestra
a
conductor
s
instrument
of
course
be
the
orchestra
itself
and
so
when
he
raise
the
wand
he
have
to
trust
that
the
musician
will
respond
and
the
musician
have
to
trust
that
he
will
create
a
collective
environment
within
which
each
can
do
his
or
her
best
work
base
on
this
experience
hazelwood
speaks
of
trust
as
be
like
hold
a
small
bird
in
your
hand
if
you
hold
it
too
tightly
you
will
crush
the
bird
hold
it
too
loosely
and
it
will
fly
away
that
bird
symbolizes
trust
in
a
time
of
transition
to
a
digital
world
but
today
we
re
in
a
confuse
state
in
which
that
bird
be
in
a
precarious
place
and
a
great
deal
be
at
stake
the
united
state
be
a
beacon
for
democracy
it
be
also
a
technology
powerhouse
that
be
lead
the
wave
in
cloud
compute
but
the
snowden
case
broke
a
crucial
ingredient
in
cloud
compute
trust
how
could
we
be
an
american
cloud
compute
company
ask
the
world
to
trust
us
when
the
nsa
be
use
commercial
service
to
spy
on
people
up
to
and
include
head
of
state
as
tech
company
we
have
to
design
trust
into
everything
we
do
but
policymakers
also
have
an
important
role
trust
be
not
only
dependent
on
our
technology
but
also
the
legal
framework
that
governs
it
in
this
new
digital
world
we
ve
lose
the
balance
we
need
in
large
part
because
our
law
have
not
caught
up
with
technological
change
later
on
i
ll
discus
what
a
modern
policy
framework
design
to
instill
trust
might
look
like
but
first
i
d
like
to
explore
the
very
essence
of
trust
and
how
it
have
shape
our
value
and
found
principle
my
mother
the
sanskrit
scholar
and
i
always
enjoy
examine
the
definition
and
philosophy
behind
eastern
and
western
word
which
often
expose
crucial
difference
between
the
way
of
think
embed
in
these
two
culture
the
sanskrit
word
vishvasa
communicates
trustworthiness
and
reliability
another
sanskrit
word
be
shraddha
which
connotes
a
religious
sense
of
faith
trust
and
belief
but
rather
than
a
blind
faith
it
be
a
faith
reminiscent
of
president
ronald
reagan
s
famous
line
trust
but
verify
in
any
case
in
both
english
and
sanskrit
trust
like
so
many
word
be
a
venn
diagram
with
many
overlap
meaning
in
either
context
for
me
trust
be
a
sacred
responsibility
as
a
computer
engineer
i
find
it
helpful
to
express
complex
idea
and
concept
accord
to
the
schema
or
algorithm
we
would
use
if
we
be
write
a
computer
program
what
be
the
instruction
to
write
to
produce
trust
of
course
there
be
no
mathematical
equation
for
such
a
humanistic
outcome
but
if
there
be
it
might
look
something
like
this
e
sv
sr
t
t
empathy
share
value
safety
and
reliability
trust
over
time
when
we
be
in
the
midst
of
negotiate
the
acquisition
of
linkedin
in
their
ceo
jeff
weiner
turn
to
me
and
say
consistency
over
time
be
trust
that
may
be
an
even
well
equation
notice
that
the
first
term
in
my
equation
for
trust
be
empathy
whether
you
be
a
company
design
a
product
or
a
lawmaker
design
a
policy
you
must
start
by
empathize
with
people
and
their
need
no
product
or
policy
work
if
it
fails
to
reflect
and
honor
the
life
and
reality
of
people
and
that
require
those
who
design
the
product
or
the
policy
to
truly
understand
and
respect
the
value
and
experience
underlie
those
reality
so
empathy
be
a
crucial
ingredient
in
develop
a
product
or
a
policy
that
will
earn
people
s
trust
next
if
we
hope
to
build
a
last
foundation
of
trust
between
a
company
and
its
customer
or
partner
or
for
that
matter
between
policymakers
and
those
affected
by
policy
we
need
to
have
share
value
such
as
be
consistent
equitable
and
diverse
have
we
prioritize
safety
and
reliability
and
ensure
that
those
whose
life
we
touch
can
count
on
experience
those
quality
day
in
and
day
out
if
we
have
we
will
build
trust
over
time
and
trust
in
turn
enables
people
and
organization
to
have
the
confidence
to
experience
explore
experiment
and
express
trust
in
today
s
digital
world
mean
everything
in
a
memo
bill
gate
sent
to
microsoft
employee
he
express
the
idea
that
trustworthy
compute
be
more
important
than
any
other
part
of
our
work
if
we
don
t
do
this
he
declare
people
simply
won
t
be
willing
or
able
to
take
advantage
of
all
the
other
great
work
we
do
trust
be
more
than
a
handshake
it
s
the
agreement
the
bond
between
user
of
digital
service
and
the
supplier
of
those
service
that
enables
us
to

deeply
personal
build

teach

and
communicate

over

these
technology
have
open

make
it

well
intentioned
people
from
all
over
the

to

but
the
flip
side
be
true
too
there
be
those
who
want
to
do
harm
there
be
those
who
plan
attack
steal

bully
lie
and
exploit
online
trust
be
essential
and
it
be
also
painfully
vulnerable
to
a
multitude
of
force
i
think
about
it
this
way
good
and
evil
play
out
continuously
not
just
in
physical
space
like
home
street
and
battlefield
but
in
space
that
be
not
so
visible
include
cyberspace
we
live
in
a
time
of
what
david
gelernter
call
the
mirror
world
the
physical
world
be
mirror
in
an
online
world
where
data
be
accumulate
and
take
on
more
and
more
significance
how
big
be
our
data
become
so
call
big
data
information
store
and
analyze
in
the
cloud
be
on
track
to
reach
trillion
gigabyte
by
to
illustrate
just
how
enormous
that
be
a
researcher
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
calculate
that
it
s
ten
time
the
information
contain
in
all
human
speech
throughout
history
it
s
a
mind
boggling
quantity
of
data
with
a
potential
for
beneficial
use
as
well
as
for
abuse
that
be
practically
limitless
so
the
mirror
world
of
cyberspace
have
incredible
potential
both
for
good
and
for
evil
just
as
our
ethic
value
and
law
have
be
developed
and
evolve
over
generation
for
the
physical
world
so
too
must
our
understand
and
rule
for

there
difference
between

i
ask
indian

this

it
turn
out
that
in

be
considerable

include
those
that
restrict

those
that
enable
the

preventively
detain
indian
often
without
show
any

on

so
as
in

this
be
not
just
my
assertion
every
year
microsoft
survey
customer
around
the
world
in
percent
of
those
survey
say
that
current
legal
protection
for
data
security
be
insufficient
and
percent
believe
the
police
should
need
a
warrant
or
its
equivalent
to
obtain
personal
information
store
on
a
pc
meanwhile
over
percent
believe
their
information
store
in
the

have
the
same
legal
protection
as
physical
file
a
belief
that
may
or
may
not
be
valid
in
the
current
unsettled
legal
climate
today
whether
in
america
india
or
anywhere
in
the
world
we
need
a
regulatory
environment
that
promotes
innovative
and
confident
use
of
technology
the
big
problem
be
antiquate
law
that
be
ill
suit
to
deal
with
problem
like
the
sony
hack
case
or
the
san

terrorist
attack
in
the

of

s
standoff
with
the

microsoft

brad
smith
go
before

to
argue
the
large
point
that
our
law
deal
with
data
privacy
and
security
be
badly
in
need
of
revision
brad
point
out
that
the
justice
department
in
the
apple
case
have
ask
a
judge
to
apply
language
from
a
law
write
and
pass
in
to
illustrate
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
brad
displayed
an
example
of
the
lead
compute
device
of
that
era
a
clunky
old
add
machine
that
go
on
sale
in
it
s
amaze
what
you
can
find
on
the
internet
he
laugh
but
brad
s
point
be
a
serious
one
we
do
not
believe
that
court
should
seek
to
resolve
issue
of
twenty
first
century
technology
rely
on
law
that
be
write
in
the

of
the
add

unfortunately
it
s
difficult
to
be
optimistic
about
the
prospect
for
smart
substantive
policy
change
give
the
dysfunction
we
see
not
only
in
washington
dc
but
also
in
capital
around
the
world
there
be
many
policy
priority
compete
for
attention
from
lawmaker
but
i
would
argue
that
get
the
rule
right
for
the
digital
revolution
be
among
the
most
important
either
trust
will
fuel
this
revolution
with
all
the
benefit
it
promise
or
distrust
will
kill
it
what
the
event
of
and
demonstrate
be
that
information
technology
have
put
the
first
and
fourth
amendment
on
steroid
computer
can
spread
freedom
of

at
lightning
speed
but
a
chill
effect
must
be
recognize
if
the
government
can
also
use
technology
to
eavesdrop
think
about
it
in
order
to
speak
or
to
write
to
express

you
must
have

our
freedom

depends
to
some
degree
on

writes
that
a
poetic
vision
of
the
interplay
between
democracy
and
individual
freedom
be
hiding
in
plain
sight
in
the
brilliantly
order
text
and
structure
of
the
bill
of
right
but
we
have
forgotten
how
to
look
for
it
as
we
search
i
d
like
to
offer
my
suggestion
for
six
way
lawmaker
can
shape
a
framework
for
building
increase
societal
trust
in
this
era
of
digital
transformation
first
we
need
a
more
efficient
system
for
appropriate
carefully
control
access
to
data
by
law
enforcement
among
government
s
many
important
responsibility
none
be
more
important
than
protect
its
citizen
from
harm
our
industry
need
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
this
responsibility
recognize
that
our
customer
be
often
the
very
people
who
need
protect
from
cybercrime
to
child
exploitation
many
law
enforcement
investigation
that
require
the
disclosure
of
digital
evidence
be
aim
at
protect
our
user
from
malicious
activity
and
help
to
ensure
that
our
cloud
service
be
safe
and
secure
therefore
under
a
clear
legal
framework
that
be
subject
to
strong
check
and
balance
government
should
have
an
efficient
mechanism
to
obtain
digital
evidence
second
we
need
strong
privacy
protection
so
that
the
security
of
user
data
be
not
erode
in
the
name
of
efficiency
government
also
have
an
obligation
to
protect
citizen
fundamental
privacy
right
collection
of
digital
evidence
should
be
target
at
specific
know
user
and
limited
to
case
where
reasonable
evidence
of
crime
exists
any
government
demand
for
user
sensitive
information
must
be
govern
by
a
clear
and
transparent
legal
framework
that
be
subject
to
independent
oversight
and
include
an
adversarial
process
to
defend
user
right
third
we
need
to
develop
a
modern
framework
for
the
collection
of
digital
evidence
that
respect
international
border
while
recognize
the
global
nature
of
today
s
information
technology
in
the
current
uncertain
and
somewhat
chaotic
legal
situation
government
around
the
world
be
increasingly
act
unilaterally
technology
company
be
face
unavoidable
conflict
of
law
create
incentive
to
localize
data
the
result
confusion
about
which
set
of
law
protects
private
data
be
erode
customer
trust
in
technology
if
this
trend
continue
the
result
could
be
disastrous
for
the
technology
industry
and
those
who
rely
upon
it
a
principled
transparent
and
efficient
framework
must
be
developed
to
govern
request
for
digital
evidence
across
jurisdiction
and
country
should
ensure
that
their
own
law
respect
that
framework
fourth
we
in
the
technology
industry
need
to
design
for
transparency
in
recent
year
technology
company
have
secure
the
right
to
publish
aggregate
data
about
the
number
and
type
of
request
they
receive
for
digital
evidence
government
should
ensure
that
their
law

many

as
a
result
government
investigate

that

thus
it
make

audibly
instead

this

allows
saqib
to
experience
the

in

by
connect

saqib

we

t
one
that
pit

the
best
way
to
answer
the
hard
question
about

in

full
of
smart

be
by
understand
the
value
of
those
who
be
actually
building
these

it
s
an
intrigue
observation
and
one
that
our
industry
must
address
at
our
developer
conference
i
explain
microsoft
s
approach
to
ai
as
base
on
three
core
principle
first
we
want
to
build
intelligence
that
augments
human
ability
and
experience
rather
than
think
in
term
of
human
v
machine
we
want
to
focus
on
how
human
gift
such
as
creativity
empathy
emotion
physicality
and
insight
can
be
mixed
with
powerful
ai
computation
the
ability
to
reason
over
large
amount
of
data
and
do
pattern
recognition
more
quickly
to
help
move
society
forward
second
we
also
have
to
build
trust
directly
into
our
technology
we
must
infuse
technology
with
protection
for
privacy
transparency
and
security
ai
device
must
be
design
to
detect
new
threat
and
devise
appropriate
protection
as
they
evolve
and
third
all
of
the
technology
we
build
must
be
inclusive
and
respectful
to
everyone
serve
human
across
barrier
of
culture
race
nationality
economic
status
age
gender
physical
and
mental
ability
and
more
this
be
a
good
start

decade

take
the

on
this
question
cynthia

at

laboratory
have
devote
her
life
to
explore
a
humanistic
approach
to
artificial
intelligence
and
robotics
argue
that
technologist
often
ignore
social
and
behavioral
aspect
of
design
in
a
recent
conversation
cynthia
observe
that
while
human
be
the
most
social
and
emotional
of
all
specie
we
spend
little
time
think
about
empathy
in
the
design
of
technology
she
say
after
all
how
we
experience
the
world
be
through
communication
and
collaboration
if
we
be
interested
in
machine
that
work
with
us
then
we
can
t
ignore
the
humanistic
approach
the
most
critical
next
step
in
our
pursuit
of
ai
be
to
agree
on
an
ethical
and
empathic
framework
for
its
design
that
be
an
approach
for
develop
system
that
specifies
not
just
the
technical
requirement
but
the
ethical
and
empathetic
one
too
to
that
end
i
have
reflect
on
the
principle
and
goal
of
ai
design
that
we
should
discus
and
debate
as
an
industry
and
a
society
ai
must
be
design
to
assist
humanity
even
as
we
build
more
autonomous
machine
we
need
to
respect
human
autonomy
collaborative
robot
co
bot
should
take
on
dangerous
work
like
mining
thus
create
a
safety
net
and
safeguard
for
human
worker
ai
must
be
transparent
all
of
us
not
just
tech
expert
should
be
aware
of
how
the
technology
work
and
what
its
rule
be
we
want
not
just
intelligent
machine
but
intelligible
machine
not
just
artificial
intelligence
but
symbiotic
intelligence
the
technology
will
know
thing
about
human
but
the
human
must
also
know
about
how
the
technology
see
and
analyzes
the
world
what
if
your
credit
score
be
wrong
but
you
can
t
access
the

when
social

collect
information
about
you
but
draw
the
wrong
conclusion
ethic
and

go
hand
in
hand
ai
must
maximize
efficiency
without
destroy
the
dignity
of
people
it
should
preserve
cultural
commitment
empower

to
ensure
this
outcome
we
need
broader
deeper
and
more
diverse
engagement
of
population
in
the
design
of
these
system
the
tech

an
opportunity

participate
in

the

inherent
in
ai
design
ai
must
guard
against
social

cultural
bias
ensure
proper

representative
research
so
that
flaw
heuristic
do
not
perpetuate

either
deliberately

in

that

ai
must
have
algorithmic
accountability
so
that
human
can
undo
unintended
harm
we
must
design
these

for
the
expect
and
the

many
of
these
ethical
consideration
come
together
for

to
us
hundred
of
time
a
day
for
me
it
call
into
question
what
the
exercise
of
free
will
mean
in
such
a
world
and
how
might
it
affect
the
many
people
and
community
who
receive
very
different
perspective
on
the
world
what
be
the
role
of
social
diversity
and
inclusion
when
it
come
to
design
content
and
information
platform
ideally
we
would
all
have
a
transparent
understand
of
how
our
data
be
be
use
to
personalize
content
and
service
and
we
should
have
control
over
this
data
but
as
we
move
increasingly
into
a
complex
world
of
artificial
intelligence
that
won
t
always
be
easy
how
can
we
protect
ourselves
and
our
society
from
the
adverse
effect
of
information
platform
increasingly
built
on
ai
that
prioritize
engagement
and
ad
dollar
over
the
valuable
education
that
come
with
encounter
social
diversity
of
fact
opinion
and
context
this
be
a
drive
question
that
need
much
more
work
but
there
be
must
for
human
too
particularly
when
it
come
to
think
clearly
about
the
skill
future
generation
must
prioritize
and
cultivate
to
stay
relevant
our
kid
and
their
kid
will
need
empathy
empathy
which
be
so
difficult
to
replicate
in
machine
will
be
invaluable
in
the
human
ai
world
the
ability
to
perceive
others
thought
and
feeling
to
collaborate
and
build
relationship
will
be
critical
if
we
hope
to
harness
technology
to
serve
human
need
we
human
must
lead
the
way
by
develop
a
deeper
understand
and
respect
for
one
another
s
value
culture
emotion
and
drive
education
some
argue
that
because
life
span
will
increase
birth
rate
will
decline
and
thus
spending
on
education
will
decline
as
well
but
i
believe
that
to
create
and
manage
innovation
we
cannot
fathom
today
we
will
need
increase
investment
in
education
to
attain
high
level
think
and
more
equitable

outcome
develop
the

on
a
large
scale
be
a
difficult
social
problem
that
will
take
a
long
time
to
resolve
the
power
loom
be
invent
in
but
take
thirty
five
year
to
transform
the
clothing
industry
because
of
shortage
of
train
mechanic
creativity
one
of
the
most
covet
human
skill
be
creativity
and
this
won
t
change
machine
will
enrich
and
augment
our
creativity
but
the
human
drive
to
create
will
remain
central
in
an
interview
novelist
jhumpa
lahiri
be
ask
why
an
author
with
such
a
special
voice
in
english
chose
to
create
a
new
literary
voice
in
italian
her
third
language
isn
t
that
the
point
of
creativity
to
keep
search
judgment
and
accountability
we
may
be
willing
to
accept
a
computer
generate
diagnosis
or
legal
decision
but
we
will
still
expect
a
human
to
be
ultimately
accountable
for
the
outcome
we
ll
look
more
closely
at
this
in
the
come
chapter
but
what
be
to
become
of
the
economic
inequality
problem
that
so
many
people
around
the
world
be
currently
focus
on
will
automation
lead
to
great
or
lesser
equality
some
economic
thinker
advise
us
not
to
worry
about
it
point
out
that
throughout
history
technological
advance
have
consistently
make
the
majority
of
worker
richer
not
poorer
others
warn
that
economic
displacement
will
be
so
extreme
that
entrepreneur
engineer
and
economist
should
adopt
a
new
grand
challenge
a
promise
to
design
only
technology
that
complement
rather
than
replaces
human
labor
they
recommend
and
i
agree
that
we
business
leader
must
replace
our

automation
mindset
with
a

it

with

twenty
eight
year
since
i
d
first
arrive
in
the

now

of

of
others

of

question
his

would
have
to
address
no
matter
who
he
or
she
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
president
s
question
felt
as
though
it
be
address
directly
to
me
how
do
we
make
technology
work
for
us
and
not
against
us
especially
when
it
come
to
solve
urgent
challenge
like
climate
change
i
sense
or
do
i
imagine
more
than
a
few
eye
search
for
my
reaction
the
president
continued
the
reason
that
a
lot
of
american
feel
anxious
be
that
the
economy
have
be
change
in
profound
way
change
that
start
long
before
the
great
recession
hit
and
haven
t
let
up
today
technology
doesn
t
just
replace
job
on
the
assembly
line
but
any
job
where
work
can
be
automate
company
in
a
global
economy
can
locate
anywhere
and
face
tougher
competition
i
squirm
a
little
in
my
chair
in
a
few
word
the
president
have
express
some
of
the
anxiety
we
all
feel
about
technology
and
its
impact
on
job
anxiety
that
would
later
play
out
in
the
election
of
president
donald
trump
in
fact
just
after
the
election
i
join
my
colleague
from
the
tech
sector
for
a
roundtable
discussion
with
president
elect
trump
who
like
his
predecessor
want
to
explore
how
we
continue
to
innovate
while
also
create
new
job
ultimately
we
need
technological
breakthrough
to
drive
growth
beyond
what
we
re
see
and
i
believe
mixed
reality
artificial
intelligence
and
quantum
be
the
type
of
innovation
that
will
serve
as
accelerants
the
son
of
an
economist
and
as
a
business
leader
i
be
hardwired
to
ob
about
these
problem
be
we
grow
economically
no
be
we
grow
equality
no
do
we
need
new
technological
breakthrough
to
achieve
these
goal
yes
will
new
technology
create
job
displacement
yes
and
so
how
can
we
therefore
solve
for
more
inclusive
growth
find
the
answer
to
this
last
question
be
perhaps
the
most
press
need
of
our
time
in
recent
decade
the
world
have
invest
hundred
of
billion
of
dollar
in
technology
infrastructure
pc
cell

tablet

smart

of
many
kind
and
a

networking
system
to
link
them
all
the
aim
have
be
to
increase
productivity
and
efficiency
yet
what
exactly
do
we
have
to
show
for
it
nobel
prize
win
economist
robert
solow
once
quipped
you
can
see
the
computer
age
everywhere
but
in
the
productivity
statistic
however
from
the
mid
s
to
the
pc
revolution
do
help
to
reignite
once
stagnant
productivity
growth
but
other
than
this
too
brief
window
worldwide
per
caput
gdp
growth
a
proxy
for
economic
productivity
have
be
disappoint
just
a
little
over
percent
per

of
course
gdp

can
be
a
crude
measure
of

in

in
a
panel
discussion
with
me
in
davos
switzerland
mit
management
school
professor
andrew
mcafee
point
out
that
productivity
data
fail
to
measure
many
of
the
way
technology
have
enhance
human
life
from
improvement
in
health
care
to
the
way
tool
like
wikipedia
have
make

available
to
million
of
people
anytime
anywhere
think
about
it
another
way
would
you
prefer
to
have
today
or
be
a
millionaire
in
many
would
love
to
be
a
millionaire
in
the
previous
century

your
money
then
could
not
buy
lifesaving
penicillin
a
phone
call
to
family
on
the
other
side
of
the
country
or
many
of
the
benefit
of
innovation
we
take
for
grant
today
and
so
beyond
this
one
measure
call
gdp
we
have
practically
a
moral
obligation
to
continue
to
innovate
to
build
technology
to
solve
big
problem
to
be
a
force
for
good
in
the

as
well
as
a
tool
for

how
can
we
harness
technology
to
tackle
society
s
great
challenge
the
climate
cancer
and
the
challenge
of
provide

just
the
week
before
that
state

in
washington
dc
question
and
observation
much
like
those
raise
by
the
president
have
be
level
at
me
by
head
of
state
during
meeting
with
customer
and
partner
in
the
middle
east
in
dubai
cairo
and
istanbul
leader
be
ask
how
the
late
wave
of
technology
could
be
use
to
grow
job
and
economic
opportunity
it
s
the
question
i
get
most
often
from
city
state
and
national
leader
wherever
i
travel
part
of
my
response
be
to
urge
policymakers
to
broaden
their
think
about
the
role
of
technology
in
economic
development
too
often
they
focus
on
try
to
attract
silicon
valley
company
in
hope
they
will
open
office
locally
they
want
silicon
valley
satellite
instead
they
should
be
work
on
plan
to
make
the
best
technology
available
to
local
entrepreneur
so
that
they
can
organically
grow
more
job
at
home
not
just
in
high
tech
industry
but
in
every
economic
sector
they
need
to
develop
economic
strategy
that
can
enhance
the
natural
advantage
their
region
enjoy
in
particular
industry
by
fully
and
quickly
embrace
supportive
lead
edge
technology
but
there
be
often
an
even
big
problem
they
be
uncertain
about
invest
in
the
late
technology
like
the
cloud
the
most
profound
difference
between
leader
be
whether
they
fear
or
embrace
new
technology
it
s
a
difference
that
can
determine
the
trajectory
of
a
nation
s
economy
take
a
look
at
history
during
the
industrial
revolution
of
the
nineteenth
century
many
of
the
key
enable
technology
be
originally
developed
in
the
united
kingdom
naturally
this
give
britain
a
big
advantage
in
the
race
for
economic
supremacy
but
the
fate
of
other
nation
be
determine
in
large
part
by
their
response
to
british
technological
breakthrough
belgium
dramatically
increase
its
industrial
production
to
a

as
a
result
of
spain
s
slow
adoption
of

and
protectionist
policy
that
decrease
its
global
competitiveness
we
see
the

principle
at

in
recent
history
the
african
nation
of
malawi
have
be
one

in

this
question
of
technology
diffusion
the
spread
of
technology
and
its
impact
on
economic
outcome
have
always
fascinate
me
how
can
we
make
technology
available
to
everyone
and
then
how
can
we
ensure
that
it
work
to
benefit
everyone
in
my
quest
for
an
answer
i
invite
dartmouth
economist
diego
comin
to
spend
an
afternoon
with
me
at
my
office
in
redmond
washington
professor
comin
be
soft
spoken
and
weighs
his
word
carefully
rely
on
the
precision
and
thoroughness
of
his
knowledge
to
carry
conviction
he
have
painstakingly
study
the
evolution
of
technology
diffusion
over
the
last
two
century
in
country
throughout
the
world
comin
and
economist
bart
hobijn
spent
year
produce
the
cross
country
historical
adoption
of
technology
chat
data
set
which
examines
the
time
frame
over
which
country
adopt
technology
from
steam
power
to
pc
they
found
that
on
average
country
tend
to
adopt
a
new
technology
about
forty
five
year
after
its
invention
although
this
time
lag
have
shorten
in
recent
year
base
on
this
analysis
comin
agrees
that
difference
between
rich
and
poor
nation
can
largely
be
explain
by
the
speed
at
which
they
adopt
industrial
technology
but
equally
important
he
say
be
the
intensity
they
employ
in
put
new
technology
to
work
even
when
country
that
be
slow
to
adopt
new
technology
eventually
catch
up
it
s
the
intensity
of
how
they
use
the
technology
not
simply
the
access
that
creates
economic
opportunity
be
the
technology
just
sit
there
or
be
the
workforce
train
to
get
the
most
productivity
out
of
them
that
s
intensity
the
question
be
not
just
when
these
technology
arrive
but
the
intensity
of
their
use
professor
comin
told
me
david
mckenzie
of
the
world
bank
put
it
another
way
he
find
the
need
for
more
intensive
training

i
d
also
visit
the
nasr
city

of
cairo

there
i
encounter
a
room
full
of
bright
optimistic
young
woman
who
have
graduate
from
some
of
the
nation
s
far
flung
college
and
university
they
have
come
to
meet
me
at
a
training
center
our
company
support
along
with
partner
like
the
united

and
the

nestle
among
international
company
office
in
a
district
close
to
the
airport
the
center
be
part
of
our
youthspark
initiative
which
have
help
more
than
million
young
people
intensively
access
computer
science
and
entrepreneurial
training
the
young
woman
explain
to
me
some
of
the
project
they
d
be
work
on
one
team
have
decide
to
help
some
of
the
refugee
from
war
torn
syria
who
have
pour
into
egypt
since
they
d
built
an
app
to
help
them
find
assistance
upon
their
arrival
in
egypt
but
it
be
another
group
s
project
that
really
fascinate
me
one
group
built
an
experience
that
digitally
transforms
the
relationship
between
pharmacy
and
patient
by
make
it
easy
faster
and
more
affordable
to
find
the
pharmacy
near
you
with
the
medication
or
supply
you
need
earlier
in
the
day
i
d
met
an
egyptian
entrepreneur
who
have
built
a
similar
app
for
locate
the
right
doctor
in
combination
they
remind
me
very
much
of
zocdoc
a
new
york
city
base
company
that
provide
similar
health
care
service
zocdoc
become
one
of
the
celebrate
american
unicorn
nonpublic
tech
startup
company
worth
billion
or
more
what
i
be
witness
firsthand
be
how
quickly
technology
be
diffuse
egyptian
entrepreneur
be
create
their
own
unicorn
even
if
they
do
not
enjoy
the
lofty
valuation
of
u
s
startup
the
core
reason
they
be
able
to
do
so
be
because
the
cloud
technology
that
enable
these
innovation
be
now
available
to
them
without
the
need
to
invest
a
lot
of
capital
unfortunately
in
many
underserved
part
of
the
world
public
and
private
attention
be
focus
on
attract
silicon
valley
company
rather
than
on
grow
local
tech
entrepreneur
successful
entrepreneur
in
develop
nation
often
tell
me
they
can
t
even
get
meeting
with
their
president
or
prime
minister
yet
those
same
head
of
state
routinely
meet
with
western
ceo
like
me
look
for
very
near
term
foreign
direct
investment
that
s
a
shortsighted
policy
and
very
frustrate
for
the
business
leader
who
be
try
to
nurture
the
long
term
prospect
of
their
local
and
national
economy
and
yet
i
see
this
mindset
everywhere
in
the
middle
east
asia
africa
latin
america
and
even
in
struggle
community
in
g
nation
like
the
united
state
the
result
failure
of
government
to
encourage
rapid
and
intensive
use
of
new
technology
mean
that
the
trend
toward
grow
economic
inequality
between
the
have
and
the
have
nots
of
the
world
have
continued
unabated
to
get
a
measure
of
how
equitable
or
inequitable
our
world
be
economist
turn
to
the
work
of
an
italian
economist
name
corrado
gini
who
in
publish
his
formula
for
calculate
what
have
become
know
as
the
gini
coefficient
which
measure
the
difference
between
a
society
s
division
of
income
and
a
perfectly
equal
division
of
income
it
s
really
quite
elegant
if
percent
of
a
give
population
be
to
earn
per
day
that
would
be
absolute
equality
if
percent
earn
million
per
year
that
too
would
be
absolute
equality
but
when
only
percent
earn
million
while
everyone
else
earns
nothing
we
re
approach
absolute
inequality
gini
s
work
provide
a
way
of
measure
the
degree
to
which
the
income
distribution
in
a
give
society
approach
or
diverges
from
perfect
equality
the
gini
coefficient
for
a
particular
population
be
generally
express
as
a
fraction
perfect
equality
would
be
represent
by
a
value
of
zero
while
maximum
inequality
would
be
represent
by
a
value
of
one
in
the
real
world
the
gini
coefficient
for
any
give
country
or
region
be
express
by
a
fraction
somewhere
in
between
those
two
extreme
the
gini
coefficient
for
an
advanced
european
country
like
germany
have
hover
around
for
decade
while
the
figure
for
the

state
have
risen
for
year
now
match
that
of
china
and
mexico
at
over
of
course
most
economist
agree
that
perfect
income
equality
be
neither
possible
nor
desirable
capitalist
economy
reward

usually
lead
to

for
many

throughout
the

when

who

carry
the
argument
even
far
in
the
upside
of

conard
concludes
that
inequality
ultimately
lead
to
faster
growth
and
great
prosperity
for
everyone
investor
wait
for

s
capacity
and
willingness
to
take
risk
and
to
find
properly

and
motivate
talent
but
excessive
inequality
have
the
perverse
effect
of
reduce
incentive
for
many
people
what
happens
when
people
work
more
and
yet
make
less
money
it
be
discourage
lead
many
people
to
slacken
their
effort
abandon
dream
of
launch
or
expand
business
and
perhaps
to
leave
the
workforce
altogether
it
also
weakens
overall
economic
activity
for
business
like
mine
it
mean
our
global
customer
have
less
to
spend
on
emerge
technology
that
could
make
them
more
productive
that
be
what
s
happen
today
there
be
a
sag
line
below
gini
s
perfect
degree
angle
that
represent
grow
inequality
i
want
to
avoid
the
pitfall
of
what
marx
described
as
late
stage
capitalism
a
theoretical
time
when
economic
growth
and
profit
collapse
and
get
back
to
the
return
enjoy
in
early
stage
capitalism
but
how
that
s
the
question
most
head
of
state
around
the
world
be
also
grapple
with
in
computer
science
and
engineering
we
search
for
something
call
the
global
maximum
it
s
a
mathematical
phrase
describe
the
optimal
state
the
high
point
of
a
function
where
technology
be
concerned
i
would
argue
that
the
global
maximum
for
every
region
of
the
world
a
country
county
or
community
should
be
to
import
the
late
world
class
technology
in
order
to
fuel
innovation
and
growth
among
that
nation
or
region
s
entrepreneur
to
drive
both
export
and
local
consumption
of
these
innovation
with
intensity
across
sector
and
segment
of
society
in
other
word
focus
on
add
value
as
well
as
broad
use
to
help
generate
surplus
and
opportunity
for
more
and
more
citizen
this
mean
every
region
in
both
developed
and
develop
country
must
grow
industry
in
which
they
have
comparative
economic
advantage
with
use
of
new
technology
input
business
leader
and
policymakers
need
to
ask
what
do
we
have
that
others
do
not
have
and
how
can
we
turn
that
unique
advantage
into
a
source
of
growth
and
wealth
for
all
our
people
china
have
clearly
do
this
with
proactive
industrial
policy
that
support
their
entrepreneur
and
economy
across
manufacturing
and
consumer
internet
service
china
strategically
use
the
global
supply
chain
and
their
own
domestic
market
to
amplify
their
comparative
advantage
and
bootstrap
their
economic
growth
the
combination
of
industrial
policy
public
sector
investment
and
entrepreneurial
energy
be
what
many
other
country
will
also
look
to
replicate
from
china
s
success
i
see
the
beginning
of
this
in
india
with
the
creation
of
the
new
digital
ecosystem
know
as
indiastack
india
be
leapfrog
from
once
be
an
infrastructure
poor
country
to
now
lead
in
digital

indiastack
usher
in
a
presence
less
cashless
paperless
economy
for
all
its
citizen
on
a
trip
to
bengaluru
i
engage
in
a
conversation
with
nandan
nilekani
about
indiastack
and
its
future
road
map
nandan
be
the
legendary
founder
of
infosys
who
go
on
to
create
a
new

work
with
the
indian
government
aadhaar
the
identity
system
that
be
at
the
center
of
indiastack
aadhaar
now
have
scale
to
over
billion
people
rival
the
growth
of
other
platform

such
as
window
android
or
facebook
enlightiks
a
startup
that
be
acquire

be
a

e
health
company
in
india
i
met
the
founder
of
enlightiks
on
the
same
trip
to
bengaluru
they
be
use
the
late
cloud
technology
and
ai
from
microsoft
to
create
a
state
of
the
art
healthcare
diagnostics
service
that
can
for
example
detect
an
atrial
fibrillation
event
before
it
happens
because
of
the
rich
data
go
from
the
personal
device
of
the
patient
directly
to
the
cloud
in
turn
this
cloud
service
can
be
make
available
to
hospital
in
small
town
or
rural
area
in
india
enlightiks
also
have
plan
to
take
advantage
of
indiastack
to
authenticate
the
user
accept
payment
create
portal
medical
record
and
much
more
this
indian
innovation
be
now
look
to
expand
in
the
united
state
africa
and
everywhere
else
this
dynamic
be
not
unique
to
china
or
india
i
saw
this
across
chile
indonesia
and
poland
and
also
in
france
germany
and
japan
reflect
on
my
earlier
visit
to
egypt
it
s
clear
they
be
invest
in
human
capital
egypt
have
an
ancient
heritage
of
science
math
and
technology
and
its
university
have
produce
physician
who
work
throughout
the
arab
world
so
health
care
turn
out
to
be
one
of
egypt
s
area
of
comparative
advantage
the
young
entrepreneur
i
met
who
have
built
apps
for
find
doctor
and
pharmacy
be
exploit
valuable
synergy
to
create
a
powerful
ecosystem
which
be
part
of
the
magic
of
modern
technology
now
they
need
affordable
powerful
cloud
service
which
can
come
from
microsoft
or
another
large
scale
cloud
provider
the
right
policy
framework
can
help
give
their
idea
flight
unfortunately
many
government
have
be
resistant
to
embrace
new
technology
like
the
cloud
even
after
they
begin
to
reach
scale
in
other
part
of
the
world
in
some
case
they
try
to
pursue
technology
strategy
that
be
self
defeat
for
example
government
leader
sometimes
cite
security
privacy
complexity
control
and
latency
delayed
processing
as
reason
for
building
their
own
proprietary
cloud
rather
than
adopt
an
exist
technology
that
have
be
make
affordable
by
multinational
demand
newly
attune
to
these
issue
and
to
the
severe
economic
consequence
they
can
produce
i
return
from
my
middle
east
trip
with
a
renew
sense
of
energy
and
duty
i
get
off
the
airplane
march
into
my
office
and
rally
our
team
to
think
through
a
set
of
recommendation
and
a
policy
framework
to
help
government
both
developed
and
develop
reduce
barrier
to
technology
adoption
and
use
so
back
to
the
question
i
pose
earlier
in
this
chapter
be
we
grow
be
we
grow
evenly
and
what
be
the
role
of
technology
there
be
of
course
no
silver
bullet
but
as
i
consider
all
of
the
evidence
and
reflect
on
my
own
experience
i
keep
return

mit
economist
daron
acemoglu
visit
our
campus
to
report
on
his
research
into
the
effect
of
technology
automation
on
labor
he
found
that
new
intelligent
machine
particularly
industrial
robot
could
have
very
consequential
effect
on
the
labor
market
his
estimate
suggest
that
on
average
each
additional
industrial
robot
reduces
employment
by
about
three
worker
this
suggests
that
without
any
countervail
change
the
spread
of
industrial
robot
could
have
very
adverse
consequence
for
job
and
wage
nevertheless
acemoglu
argues
that
other
powerful
change
trigger
by
this
onslaught
could
at
least
partly
reverse
these
consequence
as
machine
replace
labor
in
some
task
firm
will
be
incentivized
to
create
new
task
in
which
human
have
a
comparative
advantage
acemoglu
sum
it
up
this
way
although
automation
tends
to
reduce
employment
and
the
share
of
labor
in
national
income
the
creation
of
more
complex
task
have
the
opposite
effect
throughout
history
new
class
of
worker
and
new
more
complex
task
have
result
from
cut
edge
technology
acemoglu
continue
the
creation
of
new
complex
task
always
increase
wage
employment
and
share
of
labor
but
when
automation
run
ahead
of
the
process
of
creation
of
new
labor
intensive
task
technological
change
will
bring
low
employment
we
need
a
balance
growth
path
we
need
to
invent
a
new
social
contract
for
this
age
of

and

that
foster
the

that
the
origin
of

to
compress
so
much
thought
and
feel
into
the
few
line
possible
while
still
communicate
the
fullness
of
expression
although
the
prose
we
ve
write
here
do
not
approach
poetry

write
process
