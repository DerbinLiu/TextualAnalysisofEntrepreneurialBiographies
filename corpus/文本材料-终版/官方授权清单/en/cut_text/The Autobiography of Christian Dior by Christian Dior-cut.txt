prologue
the
two
christian
dior
reviewer
often
describe
author
of
memoir
as
lean
on
their
past
i
have
never
like
this
expression
for
one
thing
it
suggests
that
the
writer
need
to
lean
on
something
and
for
another
it
implies
that
his
past
be
already
dead
and
do
with
i
should
like
to
say
straight
away
that
i
feel
no
need
to
lean
on
my
past
for
support
and
i
certainly
feel
no
false
nostalgia
for
it
i
be
convince
that
my
fine
memory
be
yet
to
come
and
that
even
my
past
lie
only
just
behind
me
after
all
christian
dior
be
only
nine
year
old
which
explains
why
the
most
interest
thing
about
him
for
me
be
not
what
have
happen
to
him
in
the
past
but
what
be
go
to
happen
to
him
in
the
future
you
will
gather
from
this
that
there
be
two
christian
dior
and
i
be
speak
now
of
christian
dior
couturier
of
maison
christian
dior
avenue
montaigne
born
it
be
in
order
to
tell
the
truth
about
this
second
nine
year
old
christian
dior
that
the
first
christian
dior
decide
to
write
this
book
he
have
be
the
subject
of
quite
enough
inaccurate
discussion
already
and
i
felt
it
be
time
to
let
the
world
know
the
real
fact
about
him
in
any
case
i
be
afraid
that
if
i
wait
any
longer
i
might
find
that
i
myself
have
grown
too
far
away
from
my
subject
personally
i
always
find
the
early
year
when
a
man
be
carve
out
his
career
the
most
excite
part
of
any
autobiography
unfortunately
once
he
have
left
these
year
behind
and
enter
a
more
secure
phase
all
too
often
he
can
no
longer
understand
and
recreate
the
aspiration
of
the
man
he
once
be
ala
the
write
of
this
book
have
involve
me
in
a
completely
alien
form
of
expression
i
undertook
it
with
many
misgiving
and
survey
the
result
without
the
slightest
conceit
conceit
some
of
my
reader
will
smile
when
they
see
this
and
think
that
since
i
have
write
a
book
entirely
centre
on
myself
my
career
and
my
profession
it
be
rather
strange
for
me
to
deny
that
i
be
conceited
let
me
make
myself
clear
in
this
book
i
shall
only
discus
subject
about
which
i
know
and
can
therefore
speak
with
authority
i
assume
that
those
who
be
not
interested
in
haute
couture
and
its
ramification
will
not
be
interested
in
reading
my
book
either
whereas
those
who
be
will
assuredly
understand
and
sympathize
with
my
reason
for
want
to
write
it
i
have
not
touch
on
subject
about
which
i
have
no
expert
knowledge
such
as
abstract
art
or
the
reform
of
the
constitution
to
my
mind
that
would
be
real
conceit
i
be
a
good
deal
less
confident
about
my
handle
of
the
problem
of
the
two
christian
dior
christian
dior
the
public
figure
and
christian
dior
the
private
individual
the
former
whom
you
will
principally
read
about
in
this
book
be
the
famous
couturier
ensconce
in
a
magnificent
house
in
the
avenue
montaigne
he
be
a
compound
of
people
dress
stocking
perfume
publicity
handout
press
photograph
and
every
now
and
then
a
small
bloodless
but
inky
revolution
whose
reverberation
be
felt
all
over
the
world
perhaps
i
should
have
concentrate
entirely
on
him
and
let
nothing
of
myself
peep
through
for
i
present
a
very
different
sort
of
picture
i
be
born
at
granville
in
normandy
on
january
i
the
son
of
alexandre
louis
maurice
dior
manufacturer
and
madeleine
martin
his
wife
i
be
half
parisian
therefore
and
half
norman
and
i
be
still
very
attach
to
my
native
normandy
although
i
rarely
go
there
now
i
like
all
the
simple
thing
of
life
such
as
small
party
of
old
friend
i
detest
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
world
and
sudden
violent
change
yet
to
suppress
this
shrink
character
altogether
would
have
seem
to
me
a
form
of
cheat
it
would
also
have
deprive
my
story
of
some
of
its
personal
touch
my
celebrate
fellow
countryman
gustave
flaubert
once
defend
one
of
the
character
in
his
novel
to
a
court
with
the
bold
word
i
be
madame
bovary
and
be
that
other
christian
dior
ever
to
involve
me
in
a
similar
situation
i
should
certainly
defend
him
with
my
last
breath
i
be
he
for
whether
i
like
the
thought
or
not
my
inmost
hope
and
dream
be
express
in
his
creation
part
one
the
birth
of
maison
christian
dior
i
the
reluctant
couturier
the
most
important
feature
of
my
life
i
would
be
both
ungrateful
and
untruthful
if
i
fail
to
acknowledge
it
immediately
have
be
my
good
luck
and
i
must
also
acknowledge
my
debt
to
the
fortune
teller
who
have
predict
it
i
first
have
my
fortune
told
when
i
be
very
young
it
be
in
at
a
bazaar
near
my
home
organize
to
raise
fund
for
the
soldier
there
be
every
kind
of
sideshow
and
we
all
take
some
part
in
it
i
dress
myself
up
as
a
gypsy
suspend
a
basket
round
my
neck
by
ribbon
and
sell
lucky
charm
in
the
even
when
the
crowd
be
thin
out
i
found
myself
next
to
the
fortune
teller
s
booth
she
offer
to
read
my
palm
you
will
suffer
poverty
she
say
but
woman
be
lucky
for
you
and
through
them
you
will
achieve
success
you
will
make
a
great
deal
of
money
out
of
them
and
you
will
have
to
travel
widely
at
the
time
i
attach
absolutely
no
importance
to
her
prediction
which
seem
to
me
to
be
complete
nonsense
but
when
i
go
home
i
report
it
faithfully
to
my
parent
the
ambiguous
phrase
you
will
make
a
great
deal
of
money
out
of
woman
have
since
be
fully
explain
but
at
the
time
it
must
have
seem
as
strange
to
my
parent
as
it
do
to
me
they
be
certainly
as
ignorant
of
the
white
slave
trade
as
they
be
of
haute
couture
and
they
would
as
soon
have
believe
that
their
son
could
be
involve
in
one
as
in
the
other
the
threat
of
poverty
also
seem
inexplicable
and
as
for
travel
there
be
roar
of
laughter
in
the
family
circle
imagine
christian
a
great
traveller
think
of
the
fuss
he
make
just
go
to
see
a
friend
i
wonder
if
my
parent
would
have
recognize
me
at
the
end
of
when
the
adventure
of
christian
dior
be
just
begin
i
scarcely
recognize
myself
i
have
spent
ten
happy
year
in
the
world
of
haute
couture
as
a
designer
at
lucien
lelong
it
be
a
delightful
existence
i
have
none
of
the
responsibility
of
put
my
design
into
practice
on
the
one
hand
nor
the
burden
of
an
executive
job
on
the
other
with
the
end
of
the
war
the
departure
of
the
army
of
occupation
and
above
all
the
return
home
of
my
sister
who
have
be
deport
a
return
incidentally
which
have
be
obstinately
predict
by
a
fortune
teller
even
at
the
bad
moment
of
our
despair
i
be
free
once
more
to
lead
the
life
of
peaceful
anonymity
which
i
love
an
unhappy
chapter
of
my
life
have
end
on
the
fresh
still
unblemished
page
before
me
i
hop
to
record
nothing
but
happiness
my
optimism
enable
me
to
forget
temporarily
that
we
be
still
living
in
the
aftermath
of
a
terrible
war
trace
of
it
be
all
around
me
damage
building
devastate
countryside
ration
the
black
market
and
less
serious
but
of
more
immediate
interest
to
me
hideous
fashion
hat
be
far
too
large
skirt
far
too
short
jacket
far
too
long
shoe
far
too
heavy
and
bad
of
all
there
be
that
dreadful
mop
of
hair
raise
high
above
the
forehead
in
front
and
ripple
down
the
back
of
the
french
woman
on
their
bicycle
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
zazou
style
originate
in
a
desire
to
defy
the
force
of
occupation
and
the
austerity
of
vichy
for
lack
of
other
material
feather
and
veil
promote
to
the
dignity
of
flag
float
through
paris
like
revolutionary
banner
but
as
a
fashion
i
found
it
repellent
there
be
only
one
wartime
custom
which
i
be
sad
to
see
disappear
lack
of
petrol
have
force
us
all
to
go
everywhere
on
foot
and
without
realize
it
we
parisian
have
begin
to
enjoy
these
pleasant
stroll
which
lead
to
chance
encounter
with
our
friend
and
long
idle
gossip
en
route
it
be
in
fact
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
pilgrimage
from
the
rue
saint
florentin
to
the
rue
royale
where
i
be
then
living
that
i
actually
met
my
fate
it
appear
to
me
in
the
rather
humdrum
shape
of
a
childhood
friend
with
whom
i
have
played
long
ago
on
the
beach
at
granville
and
whom
i
have
not
see
for
year
he
be
now
a
director
of
gaston
a
couture
house
in
the
rue
saint
florentin
and
have
apparently
heard
that
i
have
become
a
designer
gesture
wildly
he
exclaim
that
our
meeting
be
the
most
wonderful
coincidence
marcel
boussac
the
owner
of
gaston
want
to
reorganize
the
whole
house
drastically
and
be
busy
look
for
a
designer
capable
of
infuse
new
life
into
it
do
i
know
the
man
in
a
million
capable
of
undertaking
this
formidable
task
i
thought
hard
for
a
few
moment
before
tell
him
regretfully
that
i
could
think
of
no
one
who
would
do
i
still
wonder
why
i
never
thought
of
suggest
myself
however
fate
do
not
let
me
escape
so
easily
i
ran
into
my
old
friend
of
the
beach
a
second
time
on
exactly
the
same
pavement
between
the
rue
saint
florentin
and
the
rue
royale
he
still
have
not
found
his
man
in
a
million
it
still
do
not
occur
to
me
to
suggest
myself
before
make
a
third
attempt
fate
prepared
the
scene
a
little
pierre
balmain
one
of
my
fellow
designer
at
lelong
decide
to
leave
and
start
a
new
house
under
his
own
name
very
successfully
as
it
have
turn
out
this
have
the
effect
of
make
me
think
seriously
about
my
own
future
for
the
first
time
i
wonder
whether
i
be
really
devoid
of
personal
ambition
it
be
true
that
i
be
extremely
happy
at
lelong
and
get
on
well
with
everyone
there
but
i
be
work
all
the
time
to
achieve
the
financial
success
of
another
man
i
be
also
toil
in
the
bond
of
his
creative
inspiration
since
my
loyalty
to
lelong
prevent
me
from
express
my
own
rather
different
idea
when
fate
brought
me
face
to
face
with
the
inquire
face
of
my
friend
for
the
third
time
on
the
same
piece
of
pavement
my
mind
be
make
up
without
realize
for
a
moment
that
i
be
alter
the
whole
course
of
my
life
i
say
boldly
after
all
this
would
i
do
these
comparatively
harmless
word
be
scarcely
out
of
my
mouth
than
i
be
overcome
with
horror
i
suddenly
foresaw
the
dreadful
consequence
of
my
rashness
first
of
all
i
should
have
to
meet
the
famous
marcel
boussac
head
of
the
comptoir
de
l
industrie
cotonni
re
cic
which
alone
seem
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
someone
as
shy
as
me
but
that
be
not
all
i
should
have
to
deal
with
a
host
of
business
men
who
knew
nothing
about
couture
and
the
very
word
business
with
its
sinister
implication
have
always
terrify
me
bad
of
all
be
the
prospect
of
something
call
a
business
lunch
hitherto
i
have
always
associate
lunch
with
the
infinitely
pleasanter
topic
of
food
now
before
meeting
marcel
boussac
for
the
first
time
i
be
to
talk
thing
over
with
his
right
hand
man
m
fayol
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
grim
function
i
be
greatly
relieve
to
find
that
m
fayol
wore
neither
a
black
jacket
nor
strip
trouser
nor
a
stiff
collar
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
be
not
stuffed
with
agenda
memoranda
and
fountain
pen
and
like
me
he
enjoy
his
food
best
of
all
he
do
not
cross
examine
me
with
search
question
and
try
to
trip
me
up
when
i
answer
a
large
kindly
good
natured
man
he
be
anxious
to
put
me
at
my
ease
and
be
completely
straightforward
in
his
discussion
with
me
furthermore
he
appreciate
feminine
elegance
because
his
own
wife
nadine
picard
adore
clothes
at
all
event
he
seem
prepared
to
believe
that
my
ignorance
of
business
be
not
a
sign
of
mental
deficiency
and
for
my
part
i
hope
i
didn
t
create
the
impression
of
a
guileless
innocent
try
to
earn
his
living
in
a
hard
world
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
be
exactly
how
i
thought
of
myself
and
it
take
me
a
long
time
to
overcome
this
complex
of
mine
have
enter
very
late
into
this
profession
where
others
have
spent
a
lifetime
learn
and
have
have
no
training
to
guide
me
except
my
own
instinct
i
have
always
be
afraid
of
betraying
my
ignorance
of
it
perhaps
it
be
this
very
fear
of
remain
the
perpetual
amateur
that
spur
me
on
to
brush
aside
my
doubt
at
last
and
invent
the
character
of
christian
dior
couturier
when
m
fayol
and
i
part
i
think
we
be
quite
pleased
with
what
we
have
see
of
each
other
we
agree
that
the
first
essential
step
be
for
me
to
pay
an
extend
visit
to
maison
gaston
in
order
to
see
how
the
business
be
run
it
be
a
splendid
excuse
for
me
to
put
off
make
any
serious
decision
and
delay
the
fatal
day
when
i
would
have
to
leave
lelong
three
day
later
i
enter
what
have
first
be
christen
with
a
great
flourish
in
the
summer
of
maison
philippe
et
gaston
as
a
schoolboy
i
remember
gaze
at
the
exquisite
pastel
colour
clothes
which
the
beautiful
hughette
duflos
have
bought
from
this
house
later
it
become
quite
simply
gaston
and
unfortunately
suffer
a
great
deal
from
wartime
difficulty
and
restriction
it
now
only
dealt
with
fur
and
have
an
old
fashion
atmosphere
which
personally
i
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
rid
of
i
inspect
the
whole
business
from
top
to
bottom
most
conscientiously
but
from
the
word
go
i
be
convince
that
marcel
boussac
would
be
waste
his
time
and
money
in
try
to
restore
gaston
to
its
former
glory
so
many
others
before
me
have
try
to
resurrect
once
famous
name
without
success
the
existence
of
a
couture
house
be
fraught
with
danger
and
its
life
span
be
often
far
shorter
than
that
of
the
men
who
run
it
my
heart
sank
at
the
thought
of
the
hazard
involve
the
cobweb
which
would
have
to
be
swept
away
the
difficulty
of
cop
with
a
staff
which
have
be
set
in
its
way
for
so
many
year
and
would
certainly
resent
change
in
short
the
impossibility
of
make
something
new
out
of
something
old
in
a
trade
where
novelty
be
all
important
as
i
left
gaston
i
decide
that
i
be
not
meant
by
nature
to
raise
corps
from
the
dead
the
answer
be
definitely
no
i
must
admit
that
i
be
secretly
very
relieve
now
i
would
not
have
to
face
lelong
with
the
news
that
i
be
leave
i
would
not
have
to
take
an
interest
in
business
i
could
sink
back
into
my
pleasant
little
rut
to
which
i
be
so
sentimentally
attach
after
so
many
year
of
hardship
i
be
prepared
to
cling
tenaciously
to
it
consequently
i
go
to
cic
the
next
morning
with
a
light
heart
know
that
nothing
would
come
of
it
because
i
intend
to
refuse
boussac
s
offer
politely
but
firmly
i
found
him
wait
for
me
and
take
an
instantaneous
like
to
both
the
man
and
his
surroundings
there
be
plenty
of
book
some
beautiful
piece
of
empire
furniture
and
a
desk
on
which
a
bronze
racehorse
a
model
of
one
of
the
favourite
of
the
master
of
the
house
have
pride
of
place
behind
it
on
the
wall
hung
a
gouache
of
rome
in
the
centre
of
all
this
be
the
great
man
himself
of
medium
height
and
stockily
built
he
have
a
determine
forehead
square
jaw
and
very
precise
speech
and
gesture
but
a
genuinely
charm
smile
lit
up
this
otherwise
rather
severe
appearance
as
i
sat
down
face
him
i
suddenly
realize
what
my
true
ambition
be
here
be
a
famous
financier
who
be
at
the
same
time
a
man
of
wide
and
cultivate
intelligence
i
knew
him
already
to
be
the
son
of
mme
jeanne
catulle
mend
s
and
the
husband
of
fanny
heldy
whom
i
have
so
often
admire
at
the
opera
obviously
his
interest
extend
far
wider
than
the
two
subject
on
which
i
be
so
lamentably
ignorant
money
and
horse
i
felt
that
we
should
get
on
extremely
well
together
shy
people
often
have
a
very
abrupt
way
of
speak
i
suddenly
heard
myself
tell
him
that
what
i
really
want
to
do
be
not
to
resurrect
gaston
but
create
a
new
couture
house
under
my
own
name
in
a
district
of
my
own
choose
i
want
a
house
in
which
every
single
thing
would
be
new
from
the
ambiance
and
the
staff
down
to
the
furniture
and
even
the
address
all
around
us
life
be
begin
anew
it
be
time
for
a
new
trend
in
fashion
greatly
dare
i
described
the
house
of
my
dream
it
would
be
small
and
seclude
with
very
few
workroom
within
them
the
work
would
be
do
accord
to
the
high
tradition
of
haute
couture
the
clothes
which
would
give
an
impression
of
simplicity
would
in
fact
involve
elaborate
workmanship
and
would
be
aim
at
a
client
le
of
really
elegant
woman
after
the
long
war
year
of
stagnation
i
believe
that
there
be
a
genuine
unsatisfied
desire
abroad
for
something
new
in
fashion
in
order
to
meet
this
demand
french
couture
would
have
to
return
to
the
tradition
of
great
luxury
which
be
why
i
envisage
my
house
as
a
craftsman
s
workshop
rather
than
a
clothes
factory
out
of
breath
and
amaze
at
my
own
temerity
i
stop
short
marcel
boussac
have
heard
me
out
with
great
patience
and
before
escort
me
to
the
door
he
told
me
that
although
i
have
outline
quite
a
different
plan
to
him
from
the
one
he
have
envisage
and
mine
be
perhaps
rather
over
ambitious
nevertheless
my
idea
interested
him
and
he
would
like
to
have
time
to
think
them
over
secretly
i
felt
that
he
must
have
be
amaze
at
my
own
high
opinion
of
myself
as
for
me
i
be
still
suffer
from
the
shock
of
discover
that
have
go
to
see
him
in
order
to
say
no
i
end
up
by
outline
a
plan
which
sound
very
like
yes
several
day
elapse
before
i
heard
that
the
boussac
group
be
definitely
interested
in
my
project
day
in
which
i
suffer
torture
of
doubt
i
have
begin
to
hope
so
fervently
that
nothing
would
come
of
it
that
this
favourable
reply
horrify
me
be
i
go
to
have
to
break
the
news
of
my
departure
to
lucien
lelong
who
also
happen
to
be
a
great
personal
friend
of
marcel
boussac
after
all
what
on
earth
have
i
let
myself
in
for
but
i
have
go
too
far
to
turn
back
now
i
could
no
longer
conceal
from
myself
that
i
have
enter
into
definite
negotiation
with
the
boussac
group
however
as
we
begin
to
plan
the
detail
of
the
business
unexpected
difficulty
arose
on
my
side
my
intransigence
arose
not
from
conceit
but
from
a
secret
unacknowledged
desire
to
escape
from
the
whole
thing
this
feel
of
panic
eventually
lead
me
to
send
a
telegram
break
off
negotiation
completely
it
be
at
this
juncture
that
i
go
to
see
madame
delahaye
the
fortune
teller
who
have
obstinately
predict
that
my
sister
would
return
from
deportation
she
order
me
sternly
to
accept
the
boussac
offer
at
once
you
must
create
the
house
of
christian
dior
whatever
the
condition
she
told
me
nothing
anyone
will
offer
you
later
will
compare
with
the
chance
which
be
open
to
you
now
in
face
of
her
complete
confidence
in
my
future
i
bow
my
head
or
to
be
honest
i
resign
myself
to
the
inevitable
a
telephone
call
to
m
fayol
and
a
few
hasty
explanation
undid
the
effect
of
my
telegram
of
refusal
negotiation
be
resume
my
fit
of
bad
temper
have
be
exhaust
and
it
now
prove
unexpectedly
easy
to
reach
an
agreement
with
m
boussac
i
plucked
up
my
courage
to
break
the
news
of
my
departure
to
lelong
or
rather
i
go
and
discuss
it
first
with
madame
raymonde
it
be
she
who
have
introduce
me
to
lelong
we
have
become
great
friend
and
in
the
past
she
have
frequently
give
me
excellent
advice
act
as
my
guardian
angel
i
have
hint
to
her
some
time
back
about
my
negotiation
with
the
boussac
group
and
she
have
make
up
her
own
mind
to
leave
the
avenue
matignon
with
me
in
order
to
back
me
up
in
my
new
enterprise
it
be
more
for
my
sake
than
for
hers
that
she
ask
a
friend
to
go
and
consult
another
very
secret
fortune
teller
call
the
grandmother
about
the
future
of
my
house
apparently
when
she
be
show
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
i
have
scribble
a
few
meaningless
sentence
the
grandmother
go
into
rapture
this
be
astonish
she
exclaim
this
house
be
go
to
revolutionize
fashion
she
paint
such
a
dazzle
picture
of
the
future
that
we
do
not
dare
to
believe
all
she
told
us
but
the
mere
fact
that
her
verdict
agree
with
that
of
my
own
fortune
teller
give
me
the
necessary
impetus
to
break
the
news
to
lelong
in
spite
of
all
his
promise
above
all
in
spite
of
my
deep
personal
attachment
to
him
i
stuck
to
my
gun
that
i
be
leave
with
mme
raymonde
and
mme
delahaye
to
back
me
up
it
be
decide
that
i
should
do
two
more
collection
for
lelong
in
order
to
be
able
to
show
round
my
successor
i
can
never
thank
lelong
sufficiently
for
the
kindness
and
understand
which
he
show
me
in
accept
the
fact
that
my
mind
be
make
up
we
part
on
the
best
of
term
in
fact
the
only
flaw
in
our
part
be
my
own
regret
at
leave
a
house
where
i
have
be
so
peacefully
happy
for
so
long
once
i
have
quit
my
dear
friend
and
most
generous
employer
the
worry
of
find
a
suitable
house
in
which
to
set
up
my
new
business
become
uppermost
in
my
mind
i
knew
exactly
what
i
want
it
be
the
house
which
i
have
described
to
marcel
boussac
but
i
have
no
idea
where
to
find
it
many
year
before
my
decisive
interview
with
him
i
have
in
fact
stop
short
in
front
of
two
small
house
side
by
side
in
the
avenue
montaigne
number
and
to
my
friend
pierre
colle
the
art
dealer
who
be
with
me
i
point
out
their
neat
compact
proportion
and
air
of
sober
elegance
without
the
least
hint
of
ostentation
pierre
have
be
the
first
person
to
suggest
that
he
should
put
up
the
money
for
a
couture
house
in
my
name
and
as
we
stood
in
front
of
the
twin
facade
i
say
to
him
jokingly
pierre
if
your
idea
ever
come
off
i
be
determine
to
set
myself
up
here
and
nowhere
else
but
in
there
be
absolutely
no
reason
for
think
that
either
of
these
two
house
be
for
sale
my
first
move
be
to
turn
to
the
agency
who
supply
me
with
a
number
of
address
all
in
the
same
part
of
the
champ
lys
e
the
house
they
suggest
be
all
extremely
smart
the
first
in
the
place
fran
ois
er
have
since
be
bought
by
madame
manguin
the
other
in
the
avenue
matignon
be
enormous
and
be
now
the
property
of
my
great
friend
and
fellow
couturier
jean
des
s
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
decide
in
favour
of
either
of
these
house
neither
of
them
be
on
the
modest
scale

at
the

time
i
could
not
put
off
make
a
decision
much
longer
so
there
i
be
distract
by
my
own
indecision
which
might
prove
fatal
to
my
whole
enterprise
but
unable
to
put
an
end
to
it
it
be
at
this
point
that
somebody
remark
quite
casually
if
you
re
look
for
a

why
don

from

that
i

that

now
responsible
for
the

left
the

have
back
it
financially

neither

depend
entirely
on
my
creative
flair
if
any
i
knew
that
if
i
be
to
emerge
victorious
in
this
war
of
the

i
have
to
be
equip
with
a
first
class

i
already
have

sensitivity
to
every

trend
of

be
belie
by
her
serene
appearance
raymonde
be
to
become
my
second

to
be
more
accurate
my

she
be
my
exact
complement

play
reason
to
my
fantasy
order
to
my
imagination
discipline
to
my
freedom
foresight
to
my
recklessness
and
she
know
how
to
introduce
peace
into
an
atmosphere
of
strife
in
short
she
have
supply
me
with
all
those
quality
which
i
have
never
have
time
to
acquire
for
myself
and
have
steer
me
successfully
through
the
intricate
world
of
fashion
in
which
i
be
still
a
novice
in
i
it
be
difficult
to
define
mme
raymonde
s
exact
position
in
my
house
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
she
hold
the
rein
of
the
business
in
her
firm
and
capable
grasp
and
applies
her
invaluable
good
sense
and
warm
humanity
to
everything
she
do
have
acquire
mme
raymonde
i
next
turn
to
mme
bricard
who
have
help
molyneux
with
his
collection
to
great
effect
we
have
become
great
friend
mme
bricard
be
one
of
those
people
increasingly
rare
who
make
elegance
their
sole
raison
d
tre
gaze
at
life
out
of
the
window
of
the
ritz
so
to
speak
she
be
superbly
indifferent
to
such
mundane
consideration
as
politics
finance
or
social
change
in
august
she
allows
herself
to
spend
a
month
at
a
fashionable
water
place
in
order
that
she
may
be
see
in
the
square
or
the
casino
but
on
the
whole
her
love
of
the
country
and
nature
do
not
go
far
than
the
flower
with
which
she
decorates
her
hat
and
her
dress
her
high
standard
be
inflexible
in
fashion
she
aim
immediately
for
the
most
marked
expression
of
that
indefinable
and
perhaps
slightly
neglect
thing
call
chic
mme
bricard
be
completely
cosmopolitan
in
her
elegance
and
i
felt
that
her
remarkable
character
her
inimitable
extravagance
of
taste
would
have
an
excellent
effect
on
the
phlegmatic
temperament
which
i
have
inherit
from
my
norman
forebear
i
knew
that
her
presence
in
my
house
would
inspire
me
towards
creation
as
much
by
her
reaction
and
even
her
revolt
against
my
idea
as
by
her
agreement
her
deep
knowledge
of
the
tradition
of
haute
couture
and
her
refusal
to
compromise
seem
the
best
possible
stimulant
for
a
temperament
like
mine
so
inclined
to
be
discourage
by
the
laissez
faire
spirit
of
our
age
in
her
personal
tradition
of
elegance
mme
bricard
seem
to
personify
that
motto
which
i
already
want
to
take
for
my
own
i
will
maintain
besides
my
two
counsellor
i
need
someone
to
act
as
an
intermediary
between
my
own
bureau
de
r
veries
as
the
eighteenth
century
call
it
and
the
workroom
where
my
idea
would
be
incarnate
in
the
shape
of
dress
at
the
house
of
the
decorator
george
geffroy
then
a
designer
at
patou
i
have
be
lucky
enough
to
meet
mme
marguerite
whom
i
always
think
of
as
dame
fashion
in
person
she
have
the
delicate
colour
of
a
renoir
and
over
the
year
she
have
become
part
of
myself
of
my
dressmaking
self
if
i
can
so
call
it
impulsive
and
obstinate
quick
temper
and
patient
she
be
so
much
in
love
with
her
work
that
our
partnership
have
have
the
character
of
a
grand
passion
if
the
world
come
to
an
end
while
she
be
pore
over
a
dress
i
really
do
not
believe
she
would
notice
it
nothing
be
ever
beautiful
enough
or
perfect
enough
for
her
she
will
stitch
unstitch
cut
cut
again
a
hundred
time
everyone
will
be
make
to
take
a
hand
include
myself
and
still
she
will
not
be
satisfied
her
enthusiasm
mount
as
the
collection
nears
completion
and
reach
its
peak
when
the
model
attain
that
degree
of
finish
which
make
us
exclaim
at
last
after
we
have
make
twenty
last
minute
alteration
it
s
impossible
to
believe
that
they
be
the
work
of
human
hand
mme
marguerite
be
exactly
the
sort
of
person
i
need
someone
whose
love
of
clothes
equal
my
own
she
be
then
work
for
patou
and
be
one
of
the
pillar
of
the
establishment
but
fortunately
the
prospect
of
a
change
of
scene
and
the
desire
strange
in
one
who
knew
so
much
to
learn
still
more
about
haute
couture
tempt
her
away
conscious
that
i
have
acquire
a
real
prize
in
my
new
premi
re
or
workroom
forewoman
i
create
the
post
of
directrice
technique
specially
for
her
which
extend
her
sphere
to
the
whole
of
maison
dior
rather
than
confine
it
to
one
particular
room
in
order
to
explain
the
exact
nature
of
her
new
position
i
must
give
a
brief
sketch
of
the
history
of
haute
couture
since
the
year
before
the
war
if
the
couturier
of
today
can
be
compare
to
stage
manager
in
the
time
of
paquin
and
doucet
they
be
more
like
film
producer
and
their
role
consist
of
exploit
and
carry
out
the
idea
of
others
of
course
they
need
to
have
an
unerring
critical
sense
in
order
to
choose
among
the
toiles
produce
by
the
premi
re
and
the
sketch
of
the
freelance
designer
who
go
from
house
to
house
display
the
sample
of
their
work
which
today
be
still
call
gravure
but
just
as
the
individual
dress
be
the
work
of
many
different
hand
the
skirt
sleeve
and
bodice
be
each
entrust
to
a
different
person
the
collection
itself
be
the
work
of
a
multitude
of
different
workroom
and
designer
inspire
by
secret
jealousy
only
the
personal
taste
of
the
head
of
the
house
exist
to
give
a
certain
unity
to
an
otherwise
heterogeneous
assembly
of
garment
the
success
of
a
dress
depend
upon
the
quality
of
the
workmanship
attention
to
detail
and
above
all
on
the
beauty
of
the
material
unlike
today
the
actual
design
of
the
dress
might
remain
virtually
unchanged
for
several
season
this
system
also
meant
that
at
the
begin
of
this
century
fashion
varied
little
from
house
to
house
and
in
order
to
introduce
some
variety
into
the
dress
they
be
often
load
with
trimming
of
exquisite
craftsmanship
braid
bead
embroidery
lace
and
frill
all
help
to
differentiate
model
which
cut
alone
would
not
have
distinguish
one
from
the
other
let
us
assume
that
each
client
want
to
wear
an
exclusive
dress
that
mme
x
could
not
sport
the
same
toilette
as
her
friend
mme

above
all
not
the
same
as
the
celebrate
and
notorious
mlle

whose
going
on
be
the
talk
of
the
town
it
be
physically
impossible
to
design
a
different
dress
for
each
lady
so
that
the
basic
design
remain
the
same
and
only
the
trimming

with
the
come

an
extremely

depend
entirely
on
their

this
be
the
age
of
the
great

outstanding
among
them
be
mlle
chanel
who
dominate
all
the
rest
although
she
pride
herself
on
not
understand
how
to
use
a
needle
in
her
personality
as
well
as
in
her

elegance

authority
from
quite
different
point
of
view
she

can
claim
to
be
the
creator
of
modern
fashion
thus
today
after
a
long
period
of
practically
anonymous
workmanship
haute
couture
have
become
the
expression
of
a
single
personality
that
of
the
head
of
the
house
perhaps
that
explains
why
couture
and
couturier
be
discuss
today
more
than
ever
before
back
to
mme
marguerite
and
the
special
new
position
i
create
for
her
be
my
own
designer
i
have
no
need
for
anyone
to
stand
in
for
me
on
that
side
of
the
business
but
i
do
need
someone
to
look
after
the
technical
side
that
be
to
say
to
supervise
the
workroom
the
premi
re
and
their
staff
be
capable
of
produce
admirable
and
minutely
detailed
workmanship
but
their
outlook
be
naturally
a
little
limited
because
they
lack
the
necessary
detachment
this
detach
view
be
to
be
provide
by
mme
marguerite
as
my
directrice
technique
arm
with
my
sketch
she
be
to
supervise
their
execution
and
correct
any
mistake
in
the
cotton
canvas
toiles
before

to
me
it
would
then
only
remain
for
me
to
make
my
own
personal
correction
which
would
emphasize
the
trend
of
the
particular
dress
as
i
have
originally
conceive
it
eventually
i
have
to
acquire
a
second
directrice
technique
as
my
business
expand
and
mme
marguerite

responsibility
become
too
heavy
raymonde
have
often
praise
mme
linzeler
to
me
for
her
understand
of
couture
and
at
the
right
moment
she
prove
free
to
come
to
us
i
give
her
a
number
of
different
job
to
do
before
finally
entrust
to
her
the
task
of
preserve
the
style
and
quality
of
the
model
in
its
passage
between
the
studio
and
the
copy

by
the
client
with
her
calm
appearance
and
silvery
hair
she
have
the
premi

well
in

and
she
inspires
confidence
in
the
most
vacillate
client
find
the
right
premi
re
for
my
workroom
be
like
a
treasure
hunt
for
this
be
the
time
when
the
couturier
salon
be
be
invade
by
a
rather
undesirable
client
le
buying
abundantly
with
money
make
on
the
black
market
eventually
i
do
succeed
in
acquire
a
staff
with
the
right
technical
skill
and
knowledge
and
i
be
ready
to
go
before
m
boussac
with
the
nucleus
of
my
organization
i
told
him
frankly
that
the
organization
which
i
be
propose
be
on
rather
a
large
scale
for
a
house
of
such
modest
size
whose
model
be
to
be
aim
at
a
fairly
restrict
client
le
but
my
goal
be
perfection
and
i
need
first
class
weapon
to
achieve
it
fortunately
m
boussac
realize
that
he
be
deal
with
a
conscientious
craftsman
not
a
megalomaniac
when
maison
christian
dior
first
open
it
have
three
workroom
in
the
attic
of
avenue
montaigne
a
tiny
studio
a
salon
in
which
to
show
the
dress
a
cabine
or
dress
room
for
the
mannequin
an
office
and
six
small
fitting
room
i
employ
sixty
people
all
told
by
general
agreement
and
to
my
great
relief
i
be
not
troubled
with
the
purely
administrative
side
of
the
business
this
be
take
over
by
jacques
rouet
he
have
no
previous
experience
of
the
fashion
world
but
i
like
him
and
felt
complete
confidence
in
him
from
the
begin
his
role
be
to
provide
my
castle
in
the
air
with
solid
foundation
when
we
first
met
i
paint
a
gloomy
picture
to
him
of
the
difficulty
he
would
encounter
the
inevitable
disorder
where
it
would
be
his
duty
to
bring
about
order
the
inevitable
atmosphere
of
strife
where
it
would
be
his
duty
to
bring
about
peace
in
short
all
the
delightful
confusion
which
by
his
very
nature
the
couturier
cannot
help
produce
fortunately
his
innate
sensitivity
enable
him
to
avoid
all
the
unexpected
pitfall
laid
for
him
by
premi
re
worker
mannequin
vendeuses
journalist
and
client
alike
he
manage
to
please
all
these
charm
but
exact
lady
without
give
way
to
them
too
much
and
appear
to
enjoy
work
for
us
at
the
same
time
for
month
he
toil
night
and
day
put
to
right
the
administrative
side
of
a
business
which
be
scarcely
establish
before
it
begin
to
expand
rapidly
once
i
have
settle
both
the
creative
and
the
administrative
side
of
my
business
i
have
to
see
to
the
equally
vital
sale
and
show
side
of
it
i
realize
that
the
ideal
person
to
look
after
the
sale
of
the
dress
be
suzanne
luling
who
come
from
my
native
granville
although
she
have
never
have
anything
to
do
with
the
run
of
a
couture
house
before
she
come
to
me
in
nine
year
she
have
make
a
great
name
for
herself
it
need
the
vocabulary
of
the
atomic
age
to
describe
her
it
be
not
enough
simply
to
say
that
she
be
dynamic
and
explosive
scarcely
conveys
her
quality
she
be
never
out
of
sort
never
flag
never
let
us
down
she
rally
the
vendeuses
spirit
when
they
be
sinking
soothes
the
client
when
they
be
fractious
and
infects
us
all
with
her
buoyant
enthusiasm
and
good
sense
i
knew
that
i
could
not
altogether
ignore
the
goddess
of
our
age
publicity
and
i
have
be
told
about
a
young
american
call
harrison
elliott
who
be
anxious
to
live
in
france
as
the
name
america
be
synonymous
with
publicity
i
decide
to
take
him
on
his
job
at
which
he
excels
consists
as
much
in
avoid
an
excess
of
publicity
as
in
stir
it
up
it
be
widely
and
quite
erroneously
believe
that
when
the
house
of
christian
dior
be
launch
enormous
sum
be
spent
on
publicity
on
the
contrary
in
our
first
modest
budget
not
a
single
penny
be
allot
to
it
i
trust
to
the
quality
of
my
dress
to
get
christian
dior
talk
about
moreover
the
relative
secrecy
in
which
i
chose
to
work
arouse
a
positive
whisper
campaign
which
be
excellent
free
propaganda
gossip
malicious
rumour
even
be
worth
more
than
the
most
expensive
publicity
campaign
in
the
world
another
old
friend
from
granville
come
on
the
scene
in
the
shape
of
serge
heftler
louiche
even
before
the
opening
of
my
couture
house
he
have
suggest
that
we
should
launch
christian
dior
perfume
together
and
i
gladly
agree
when
number
of
others
of
my
old
friend
also
want
to
take
part
in
the
venture
i
be
pleased
to
discover
that
i
be
go
to
be
one
of
the
few
prophet
who
be
honour
in
his
own
country
the
first
vendeuse
i
engage
nicole
riotteau
also
come
from
granville
she
have
be
like
a
sister
to
me
i
be
delighted
to
see
so
many
old
friend
reunite
although
a
very
different
prospect
face
us
now
from
the
picnic
fishing
expedition
and
croquet
party
of
our
youth
many
of
the
other
vendeuses
who
chose
to
throw
in
their
lot
with
me
have
be
oblige
to
leave
paris
and
the
world
of
fashion
during
the
war
and
have
not
yet
won
back
their
place
in
the
house
which
have
employ
them
in
these
be
our
founder
member
and
pillar
of
the
new
house
of
christian
dior
with
affection
and
gratitude
i
recall
their
name
yvonne
laget
who
combine
personal
charm
with
a
keen
commercial
sense
suzanne
beguin
who
have
be
train
in
the
great
tradition
of
mainbocher
mme
gervais
particularly
knowledgeable
about
italy
mme
de
segonza
and
mme
lancien
two
society
woman
who
quickly
become
excellent
professional
vendeuses
and
finally
the
last
recruit
from
granville
mme
de
nabat
who
join
us
from
chanel
in
our
second
season
it
be
never
particularly
easy
engage
the
right
mannequin
and
i
chose
a
peculiarly
unfortunate
time
to
try
in
despair
at
not
be
able
to
find
the
type
of
girl
i
want
i
decide
to
put
an
advertisement
in
the
paper
as
luck
would
have
it
i
chose
the
exact
moment
when
a
new
law
be
force
certain
famous
paris
brothel
to
close
down
and
many
of
their
former
inmate
be
find
themselves
without
regular
employment
these
lady
read
my
advertisement
and
be
overjoyed
perhaps
they
imagine
that
a
fashion
house
opening
discreetly
in
a
modest
house
in
the
avenue
montaigne
would
conceal
some
altogether
more
disreputable
trade
within
its
sober
wall
on
the
appoint
day
my
house
where
work
be
already
under
way
be
literally
invade
by
unmistakable
cohort
of
lady
of
the
street
mme
raymonde
who
be
in
charge
of
the
applicant
be
appalled
and
wonder
what
on
earth
to
do
with
them
all
i
decide
i
must
see
the
whole
lot
from
toulouse
lautrec
downwards
i
found
myself
interview
every
good
time
girl
in
paris
several
of
them
be
actually
very
pretty
but
none
of
them
have
the
sort
of
look
suit
to
my
purpose
amongst
this
horde
i
do
discover
one
charm
and
rather
shy
young
girl
of
an
altogether
different
calibre
she
be
a
former
secretary
call
marie
th
r
se
and
she
become
one
of
our
best
model
after
this
unfortunate
experience
i
make
up
my
mind
not
to
risk
insert
another
advertisement
in
the
paper
and
put
my
staff
on
to
the
job
of
find
the
five
girl
we
need
for
the
opening
by
other
mean
in
the
end
my
first
cabine
of
mannequin
contain
no
lle
paule
yolande
lucile
tania
and
marie
th
r
se
these
be
the
girl
who
model
the
new
look
and
whose
graceful
pirouette
walk
found
a
new
fashion
in
model
but
of
that
more
later
by
the
time
i
have
make
all
these
arrangement
it
be
july
i
decide
to
open
my
house
on
december
and
show
my
first
collection
to
the
world
in
the
spring
of
i
before
i
left
lelong
i
give
a
small
party
for
my
former
colleague
which
for
me
at
least
be
ting
with
sadness
i
be
bidding
farewell
to
my
year
of
apprenticeship
and
in
the
very
middle
of
the
dinner
i
receive
another
unpleasant
intimation
that
my
carefree
youth
be
over
i
be
call
to
the
telephone
to
hear
that
my
father
have
die
suddenly
in
his
house
at
callian
in
the
south
of
france
although
i
be
then
forty
i
felt
as
if
i
have
come
of
age
for
the
second
time
however
impatient
we
get
when
our
parent
refuse
to
accept
the
fact
that
we
have
grown
up
this
very
weakness
of
theirs
support
and
comfort
us
how
much
we
only
realize
when
we
be
suddenly
face
with
their
loss
i
be
no
longer
a
child
to
anyone
it
be
my
turn
to
provide
comfort
and
support
for
those
who
be
come
after
me
i
have
to
step
out
of
the
warmth
and
intimacy
of
the
family
circle
and
welcome
into
the
world
that
forbid
stranger
christian
dior
couturier
i
certainly
do
my
best
to
provide
him
with
an
attractive
dwell
and
in
order
that
he
might
share
as
much
of
my
past
as
possible
i
chose
to
decorate
his
couture
house
in
the
colour
which
have
dominate
my
parisian
childhood
and
have
since
go
completely
out
of
fashion
from
to
decoration
la
louis
seize
be
all
the
rage
in
the
new
house
in
passy
white
woodwork
white
enamel
furniture
grey
hanging
glass
door
with
square
pane
and
bronze
light
bracket
with
small
lampshade
the
unobtrusive
elegance
of
this
period
still
survives
in
the
salon
of
the
ritz
and
plaza
and
the
house
of
cheruit
be
decorate
in
it
i
felt
that
it
would
be
the
ideal
background
against
which
to
show
my
collection
with
its
sober
but
by
no
mean
bleak
simplicity
above
all
its
classical
and
parisian
elegance
i
be
determine
that
my
decor
should
not
degenerate
into
elaborate
decoration
and
distract
the
eye
from
my
clothes
which
should
after
all
be
the
focal
point
of
the
whole
proceeding
but
where
in
be
i
to
find
the
man
capable
of
transform
my
dream
into
reality
within
the
limit
of
my
modest
budget
my
friend
who
be
professional
decorator
be
either
too
purist
or
too
much
in
love
with
their
idea
to
listen
to
mine
i
do
not
want
an
authentic
louis
seize
interior
i
want
a
version
of
louis
seize
a
notion
which
most
of
them
would
have
consider
mere
folly
i
remember
that
victor
grandpierre
whom
i
have
see
a
lot
of
in
cannes
at
the
begin
of
the
german
occupation
have
often
told
me
that
he
want
to
become
a
decorator
he
be
the
son
of
the
fashionable
architect
who
built
princess
de
polignac
s
house
jean
de
reszke
s
private
theatre
and
several
other
masterpiece
of
the
period
victor
grandpierre
have
be
brought
up
in
the
right
tradition
and
he
do
in
fact
prove
to
be
the
very
man
i
be
look
for
i
sent
such
a
press
letter
to
him
at
cannes
where
he
be
on
holiday
that
he
instantly
left
for
paris
and
set
to
work
try
to
put
into
practice
the
very
confuse
idea
which
i
sketch
out
to
him
fortunately
our
taste
coincide
wonderfully
and
we
be
both
equally
happy
recapture
the
magic
year
of
our
childhood
he
create
the
helleu
salon
of
my
dream
all
in
white
and
pearl
grey
look
very
parisian
with
its

profusion
of

so
much
prettier
than
the
bizarre
philodendron
which
be
in
vogue
today
after
complete
the
salon
victor
create
the
tiny
boutique
which
i
intend
to
be
a
copy
of
the
eighteenth
century
shop
which
sell
luxurious
trifle
while
he
be
still
at
work
that
arbiter
of
elegance
christian
b
rard
paid
us
a
visit
of
inspection
with
his
beard
flow
and
his
little
dog
jacinthe
at
his
heel
he
penetrate
every
corner
of
the
house
we
await
his
verdict
with
beating
heart
know
his
pronouncement
on
matter
of
taste
and
style
to
be
infallible
fortunately
he
give
us
his
approval
and
suggest
several
improvement
of
detail
such
as
cover
the
boutique
in
toile
de
joy
and
lavishly
scatter
about
hatbox
inscribed
with
our
name
on
the
top
of
cupboard
and
in
odd
corner
it
be
an
inspiration
the
seem
casualness
brought
the
whole
place
to
life
carry
away
by
the
subject
of
my
decorative
scheme
i
have
say
nothing
about
my
actual
feeling
at
the
moment
when
i
present
to
the
public
the
first
dress
bearing
my
name
i
must
confess
that
of
all
my
collection
the
opening
one
cause
me
the
least
effort
and
worry
then
i
ran
no
risk
of
disappoint
my
public
because
i
have
no
public
to
disappoint
nothing
be
know
about
me
and
therefore
nothing
expect
of
me
of
course
i
have
to
try
to
please
them
but
more
for
the
sake
of
my
own
self
respect
than
anything
else
far
from
want
to
revolutionize
fashion
i
be
chiefly
concerned
with
produce
a
high
standard
of
workmanship
i
aim
at
be
consider
a
good
craftsman
no
mean
aim
it
be
true
since
it
implies
both
integrity
and
high
quality
but
i
never
guess
what
an
explosive
quality
my
modest
formula
would
prove
to
have
in
an
age
of
compromise
and
laissez
faire
i
left
lelong
on
december
and
go
to
stay
with
my
friend
the
colles
at
fleury
en
bi
re
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
which
be
then
under
snow
i
spent
a
fortnight
there
create
and
design
my
first
collection
although
it
be
true
as
be
often
say
that
one
breathes
in
fashion
with
the
very
air
of
paris
i
find
that
the
peace
and
calm
of
the
country
be
absolutely
essential
to
me
after
a
while
in
order
to
reflect
on
the
lesson
which
i
have
learnt
in
the
city
itself
a
thousand
fleeting
image
surge
through
my
mind
and
be
speedily
imprison
by
the
stroke
of
my
pencil
l
they
elude
me
for
ever
one
by
one
i
weed
them
out
i
ponder
on
the
idea
which
remain
for
several
day
before
make
my
final
choice
which
be
the
basis
of
the
new
look
temperamentally
i
be
reactionary
not
to
be
confuse
with
retrograde
we
be
just
emerge
from
a
poverty
stricken
parsimonious
era
obsess
with
ration
book
and
clothes
coupon
it
be
only
natural
that
my
creation
should
take
the
form
of
a
reaction
against
this
dearth
of
imagination
i
suppose
it
be
inevitable
that
certain
people
should
say
that
i
design
those
long
full
dress
with
an
immense
yardage
of
material
in
their
skirt
which
be
the
triumph
of
my
collection
and
be
fashionable
today
in
response
to
pressure
from
m
boussac
and
his
textile
interest
but
they
make
a
great
mistake
in
think
that
fashion
varies
accord
to
the
dictate
of
commerce
i
swear
that
any
fashion
inspire
by
that
sort
of
consideration
would
have
no
chance
of
survive
still
less
of
succeed
and
develop
in
fact
m
boussac
give
me
an
absolutely
free
hand
to
design
as
i
pleased
in
december
as
a
result
of
the
war
and
uniform
woman
still
look
and
dress
like
amazon
but
i
design
clothes
for
flower
like
woman
with
round
shoulder
full
feminine
bust
and
hand
span
waist
above
enormous
spread
skirt
an
ethereal
appearance
be
only
achieve
by
elaborate
workmanship
in
order
to
satisfy
my
love
of
architecture
and
clear
cut
design
i
want
to
employ
quite
a
different
technique
in
fashion
my
clothes
from
the
method
then
in
use
i
want
them
to
be
construct
like
building
thus
i
mould
my
dress
to
the
curve
of
the
female
body
so
that
they
call
attention
to
its
shape
i
emphasize
the
width
of
the
hip
and
give
the
bust
its
true
prominence
and
in
order
to
give
my
model
more
presence
i
line
nearly
all
of
them
with
cambric
or
taffeta
thus
revert
to
an
old
tradition
my
return
to
long
forgotten
technique
arouse
a
host
of
difficulty
for
of
course
none
of
my
staff
have
any
experience
of
them
as
soon
as
i
have
exhibit
my
design
they
apply
themselves
to
the
problem
with
mme
marguerite
at
their
head
the
work
be
carry
out
under
condition
of
unbelievable
difficulty
the
lack
of
space
in
my
studio
formerly
a
boudoir
force
us
to
make
use
of
every
inch
of
free
space
in
order
to
have
enough
elbow
room
eventually
i
flee
from
the
grow
invasion
of
material
on
to
the
land
and
even
found
myself
work
on
the
step
of
the
staircase
the
whole
building
be
in
a
fever
one
of
our
key
premi
re
collapse
with
a
nervous
breakdown
a
victim
of
this
mad
regime
we
have
to
replace
her
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
by
a
particularly
talented
underling
monique
who
luckily
be
more
than
equal
to
the
task
with
christiane
she
deserves
every
credit
for
the
success
of
the
collection
they
even
have
to
make
the
suit
because
the
expert
whom
i
engage
for
the
purpose
prove
incapable
of
do
it
my
own
thought
and
energy
be
concentrate
on
the
most
perfect
reproduction
of
the
ninety
model
i
have
design
all
around
me
at
the
order
of
mme
marguerite
the
premi
re
and
their
subordinate
be
rediscover
or
invent
the
appropriate
technique
to
execute
the
design
which
have
be
entrust
to
them
they
be
mostly
complete
stranger
to
one
another
but
within
a
few
week
they
be
work
together
as
proper
team
worn
out
by
the
triple
task
of
organize
the
business
recruiting
the
staff
and
create
the
dress
i
sometimes
let
myself
flop
down
exhaust
on
to
the
heap
of
material
by
now
there
be
practically
nowhere
else
to
sit
we
all
felt
the
strain
there
be
only
six
mannequin
and
the
thousand
of
different
fitting
impose
such
a
nervous
and
physical
strain
upon
them
that
on
one
occasion
an
extremely
pretty
blonde
english
girl
turn
faint
and
collapse
into
my
arm
i
thought
i
be
clutch
her
securely
but
she
continued
to
slide
to
the
floor
and
i
found
myself
hold
her
bust
i
have
completely
forgotten
that
in
my
desire
to
give
prominence
to
this
most
feminine
attribute
i
have
ask
those
whom
nature
have
neglect
to
equip
themselves
with
falsie
the
material
themselves
be
another
source
of
worry
in
those
day
there
be
nothing
like
the
high
standard
of
quality
we
have
today
i
want
silk
fabric
where
the
yarn
itself
and
not
the
woven
material
have
be
dyed
but
anything
which
have
any
body
to
it
be
extremely
hard
to
find
for
year
cr

have
supplant

inexorably
the
date
at
which
i
would
have
to
show
my
collection
crept
forward
i
intentionally
have
not
worried
about
publicity
but
trust
to
a
few
loyal
friend
to
get
the
new
house
talk
about
in
paris
the
intellectual
and
social
stand
of
comte

and
mme

and
the
fervour
which
marie

christian

and
several
friend
of
mine
who
be
journalist
include
michel
de
brunhoff
paul
caldagues
and
james
de
coquet
manage
to
communicate
to
others
arouse
a
fever
of
popular
curiosity
from
which
all
at
once
i
recoil
in
alarm
i
felt
that
too
many
hope
be
be
pin
on
me
and
that
i
be
incapable
of
fulfil
them
it
be
only
with
the
great
possible
reluctance
that
i
be
finally
persuade
to
show
my
dress
to
my
friend
one
even
just
before
their
formal
presentation
to
the
public
b
rard
cry
out
that
i
have
achieve
a
miracle
and
marie
louise
bousquet
chime
in
with
other
flatter
exclamation
be
superstitious
by
nature
i
immediately
look
round
for
a
piece
of
wood
to
touch
it
all
seem
a
little
too
good
to
be
true
and
therefore
ominous
but
my
most
fortunate
piece
of
publicity
be
quite
unplanned
life
magazine
ask
me
to
pose
with
a
smile
and
the
suppose
natural
or
inspire
expression
which
i
have
have
to
try
and
assume
so
often
since
at
the
time
i
have
no
idea
of
the
importance
of
an
article
in
life
in
launch
anything
like
fortune
the
goddess
of
publicity
often
seem
to
smile
most
favourably
on
those
who
court
her
least
up
till
now
i
have
only
held
hasty
rehearsal
in
a
salon
clutter
up
with
mannequin
seamstress
and
premi
re
but
it
be
essential
to
have
some
sort
of
a
dress
rehearsal
nevertheless
i
knew
it
would
give
absolutely
no
idea
of
the
collection
as
it
would
ultimately
appear
to
the
public
until
the
opening
the
true
significance
of
the
dress
would
be
lose
on
anyone
except
those
who
have
actually
create
and
sewn
them
so
i
decide
not
even
to
show
the
model
to
the
vendeuses
for
them
as
for
the
press
and
my
future
client
le
the
curtain
would
rise
on
the
collection
for
the
first
time
on
the
appoint
day
i
have
stuck
to
this
decision
ever
since
in
spite
of
the
plea
which
have
be
make
to
me
to
yield
i
suppose
i
be
subconsciously
try
to
halt
the
invasion
of
the
commercial
spirit
into
the
milieu
which
i
love
at
last
the
finish
touch
be
put
to
the
dress
now
that
there
be
no
far
opportunity
to
alter
them
i
suddenly
felt
a
strange
calm
come
over
me
i
have
only
one
thing
to
say
about
my
collection
i
thought
it
would
do
that
be
to
say
i
thought
it
would
please
and
satisfy
the
client
le
at
which
it
be
aim
fortunately
the
anxiety
of
receive
my
guest
correctly
take
my
mind
off
my
actual
collection
by
a
miracle
the
decor
be
finish
as
in
spite
of
my
constant
nag
the
decorator
have
lag
behind
their
schedule
as
mme
delahaye
have
predict
the
last
bang
of
the
last
hammer
be
actually
heard
as
the
first
visitor
enter
i
myself
arrive
very
early
on
the
great
day
and
fidget
about
on
the
carpet
which
be
still
be
tacked
down
by
dawn
the
whole
house
be
in
a
state
of
uproar
which
make
it
seem
more
like
late
afternoon
carmen

have
spent
the
last
hour
of
darkness
transform
the
cubbyhole

in
the

lachaume
be
arrange
the
last
vas
of

and
i
thought
the

of
grey
satin

it
look
very
elegant
in
the
dress
room

ready
for
the
fray
and
by
a
miracle

to
be
there
too
have
arrive
safely
from
the

soon

accompany
by
gust
of
applause
i
stuffed
my
ear
terrify
of

confident
too
soon
but
a
series
of
short
bulletin
from
the
field
of

confirm
to
me
that
my
troop

at

with
joy
in

to
propel
us
into
the
big
salon
where
we
be
greet
by
a
salvo
of
applause
as
long
as
i
live
whatever
triumph
i
win
nothing
will
ever
exceed
my
feeling
at
that
supreme
moment
iii
the
new
look
very
soon
the
public
the
press
and
my
sale
ledger
combine
to
tell
me
that
like
m
jourdain
in
le
bourgeois
gentilhomme
who
spoke
prose
without
know
it
i
have
do
a
dior
without
realize
it
the
style
which
be
be
universally
hail
as
new
and
original
be
nothing
but
the
sincere
and
natural
expression
of
fashion
which
i
have
always
sought
to
achieve
it
happen
that
my
own
inclination
coincide
with
the
tendency
of
the
time
and
thus
attain
add
importance
it
be
easy
to
make
oneself
look
ridiculous
by
inject
philosophy
and
reflection
on
society
into
the
midst
of
a
discussion
on
silk
and
satin
but
since
i
be
widely
held
responsible
for
a
social
trend
i
may
perhaps
be
allow
to
analyse
my
own
success
i
believe
it
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
brought
back
the
neglect
art
of
please
remember
the
year
before
the
war
remember
the
extravagance
of
those
surrealist
trimming
in
tune
with
the
surrealist
interior
decoration
of
the
house
with
which
mme
schiaparelli
love
to
decorate
her
clothes
an
even
dress
might
look
like
a
huge
lobster
and
a
hat
would
be
make
in
the
shape
of
a
shoe
or
a
cutlet
as
for
the
button
heaven
know
what
shape
they
be
it
be
fine
just
so
long
as
it
be
the
fashion
for
fashion
be
always
right
it
have
a
fundamental
rightness
which
those
who
create
it
like
those
who
follow
it
often
know
nothing
about
with
her
great
talent
mme
schiaparelli
knew
how
to
push
the
frontier
of
elegance
until
it
border
on
the
bizarre
perhaps
from
onwards
even
she
go
a
little
too
far
because
balenciaga
who
have
just
open
his
house
mainbocher
and
robert
piguet
with
whom
i
be
then
work
as
a
designer
initiate
the
return
to
a
more
classical
style
with
its
restriction
and
the
zazou
fashion
which
i
discuss
earlier
the
war
quickly
put
a
stop
to
this
natural
development
but
in
after
so
many
year
of
wander
couture
be
weary
of
only
catering
for
painter
and
poet
and
want
to
revert
to
its
true
function
of
clothing
woman
and
enhance
their
beauty
in
the
opinion
of
the
public
this
be
exactly
the
function
which
my
first
collection
perform
they
be
delighted
to
be
face
with
fashion
which
be
european
rather
than
exotic
clothes
which
be
well
make
and
style
which
be
become
and
pretty
for
the
first
time
in
year
in
it
be
time
for
fashion
to
forsake
adventure
and
make
a
temporary
return
to
base
you
will
remember
that
i
be
aim
principally
at
an
establish
client
le
of
experienced
buyer
and
habitually
elegant
woman
i
now
have
the
pleasant
surprise
of
find
that
young
woman
want
to
adopt
the
new
fashion
as
well
dominique
blanchard
in
the
full
bloom
of
her
youthful
beauty
wore
the
most
ostentatiously
new
look
dress
in
her
part
in
a
play
of
giraudoux
l
apollon
de
bellac
i
like
this
model
so
much
that
i
christen
it
ch
rie
it
have
a
tight
bodice
a
tiny
waist
and
eighty
yard
of
pleat
white
faille
descend
almost
to
the
hem
in
the
enormous
bustle
of
the
skirt
saint
germain
de
pr
s
do
not
want
to
be
left
out
and
i
be
delighted
to
find
the
existentialist
singer
juliette
gr
co
who
incarnate
black
jerseyed
tight
trousered
youth
within
the
precinct
of
a
house
of
couture
with
rare
intelligence
juliette
gr
co
understood
how
to
conciliate
the
demand
of
her
own
individual
style
with
those
of
my
design
thus
the
new
look
become
symbolic
of
youth
and
the
future
my
first
collection
be
successful
beyond
my
wild
dream
from
the
moment
it
open
the
press
and
then
the
buyer
packed
into
my
salon
the
crowd
force
us
to
enlarge
the
land
and
get
rid
of
a
charm
old
staircase
there
be
still
not
enough
room
so
the
invader
spill
out
on
to
the
staircase
and
people
sat
on
the
step
in
order
of
precedence
like
in
an
amphitheatre
we
soon
found
that
we
be
have
to
turn
people
away
every
day
so
we
institute
a
system
of
reserve
place
which
prevent
people
from
feel
that
they
have
be
deliberately
exclude
as
a
result
of
a
personal
grudge
on
the
part
of
the
management
this
system
have
another
advantage
in
that
it
enable
the
public
to
get
in
and
prevent
would
be
copyist
from
keep
out
potential
client
it
be
my
first
contact
with
the
fashion

and
professional
buyer

the
collection
now
everything
be
different
i
have
to
follow
up
my
astonishingly
successful
opening
which
involve
me
in
fresh
responsibility
of
course
i
have
several
old
friend
among
the
press

have
already
mention
michel

a
designer
i
have
know
alice
chavanne
and
genevieve
perreau
of

in
the
day
when
mme

a
salon
in
her
little
house
in
the
rue

along
on
her
day
this

long
before

of
the
place

where
it

a
famous

but
all
over
the
world
i
be
extremely
shy
in
those
day
and
never
penetrate
beyond
marie
louise
s
facade
of
unvarying
affability
which
be
her
protection
against
the
encroachment
of
the
world
later
work
the
friend
we
have
in
common
as
well
as
the
joy
and
sorrow
which
we
share
enable
me
to
see
behind
the
smile
mask
she
become
a
great
friend
and
ally
of
mine
and
just
before
the
war
introduce
me
to
carmel

who
have
intend
to
ask
me
to
do
design
for

bazaar
at
lelong
i
have
know
bettina
wilson
now
bettina
ballard
who
be
then
work
for
vogue
some
time
before
my
first
show
i
have
also
met
mr
perkins
of
the
all
important
american
magazine
woman
s
wear
this
paper
find
sufficient
interest
in
the
subject
of
feminine
apparel
to
distribute
fifty
page
daily
of
editorial
and
advertisement
on
fashion
across
the
whole
of
america
i
also
knew
mme
castanie
who
presides
over
the
bible
of
french
fashion
officiel
de
la
couture
and
lucie
noel
of
the
new
york
herald
but
i
still
have
many
vital
contact
with
the
press
to
make
to
say
nothing
of
the
all
important
photographer
and
artist
the
relationship
of
a
couturier
with
the
press
be
like
a
love
affair
a
never
end
love
affair
renew
each
season
involve
endless
intrigue
and
reconciliation
elliott
be
do
the
work
of
ten
men
and
even
so
could
not
cope
with
the
extraordinary
variety
of
demand
which
be
make
upon
his
time
by
the
press
so
i
have
to
see
its
principal
representative
personally
i
also
begin
to
experience
for
myself
the
remorseless
war
which
the
daily
paper
carry
on
in
order
to
reveal
as
early
as
possible
the
fashion
secret
of
the
come
season
to
their
reader
a
house
which
be
determine
to
get
as
good
a
press
as
possible
also
know
that
premature
and
detailed
publication
of
its
model
help
to
produce
copy
and
vulgarizes
the
style
so
i
have
to
learn
how
to
fend
off
indiscreet
question
with
a
wary
smile
i
have
to
extend
a
warm
welcome
to
all
the
world
appear
to
be
delighted
at
see
so
many
of
my
model
reproduce
and
at
the
same
time
feel
furious
if
too
many
be
of
course
the
couturier
to
whom
the
magazine
give
too
little
space
be
not
satisfied
either
the
general
public
be
happily
ignorant
of
the
storm
of
suspicion
and
ill
feel
to
which
a
reproduction
of
a
model
in
colour
on
the
cover
of
a
fashion
magazine
can
give
rise
the
number
of
model
from
each
couturier
which
be
reproduce
their
position
and
juxtaposition
in
the
paper
all
these
detail
be
eagerly
note
by
his
rival
rightly
or
wrongly
couturier
be
quick
to
suspect
favouritism
and
be
as
susceptible
to
affront
as
the
author
of
play
which
be
say
a
lot
have
make
the
necessary
contact
with
the
press
i
now
have
to
meet
the
professional
buyer
and
their
backer
as
the
date
of
my
opening
have
be
comparatively
late
in
the
season
a
good
many
of
the
american
buyer
have
already
left
paris
after
place
all
their
order
but
the
furore
create
by
the
first
collection
of
the
new
couture
house
induced
them
to
return
i
knew
practically
none
of
them
personally
though
of
course
some
of
their
name
be
familiar
to
me
magnin
harry

the
once
celebrate
representative
of

goodman
miss
frankau
and
miss
daude
leon
schmodlen
who
represent
bendel
and
miss
cathlin
the
buyer
at
marshall
field
in
the
buyer
who
have
gradually
torn
themselves
away
from
chanel
and
vionnet
in
be
turn
their
step
once
more
in
the
direction
of
paris
but
time
have
change
the
big
shop
they
represent
now
only
stock
a
line
of
make
to
measure
dress
for
the
sake
of
prestige
and
at
a
heavy
loss
couture
in
the
parisian
sense
scarcely
exists
in
america
the
land
where
it
have
take
all
the
undoubted
talent
of
mainbocher
valentine
charlie
james
and
others
merely
to
keep
themselves
in
existence
i
knew
therefore
that
we
could
not
hope
for
the
lavish
order
by
the
hundred
which
our
predecessor
have
enjoy
but
only
carefully
premeditate
order
limited
to
the
model
which
be
either
most
typical
of
the
new
fashion
or
easy
to
reproduce
it
be
true
that
i
be
a
french
couturier
but
i
have
to
understand
the
need
of
elegant
woman
all
over
the
world
as
well
as
my
fellow
countrywoman
help
by
my
good
relation
with
such
experienced
member
of
my
profession
i
be
soon
design
print
for
california
and
muslin
for
rio
de
janeiro
in
an
effort
to
give
woman
of
different
way
of
life
the
clothes
they
want
maison
dior
be
in
a
ferment
even
at
night
as
a
newcomer
to
the
world
of
haute
couture
i
have
now
to
catch
up
on
my
start
and
sell
sell
sell
my
model
all
day
long
fortunately
the
whole
world
be
march
in
my
direction
follow
the
vanguard
of
the
critic
the
english
follow
the
american
then
come
the
italian
who
be
excellent
client
from
the
first
give
the
lie
to
this
absurd
myth
of
a
franco
italian
fashion
war
which
do
not
exist
and
never
have
the
belgian
the
swiss
and
the
scandinavian
follow
a
little
while
after
come
the
south
american
the
australian
and
several
season
later
the
german
and
the
japanese
our
vendeuses
be
up
to
their
ear
in
work
for
now
private
client
be
swell
the
throng
of
indefatigable
professional
and
there
be
danger
of
a
complete
bottleneck
in
the
workroom
i
decide
to
open
two
more
at
once
and
m
boussac
and
i
also
commit
ourselves
to
the
construction
of
a
new
seven
storey
building
of
workroom
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
our
principal
problem
be
find
a
site
on
which
to
build
there
seem
nothing
for
it
but
to
knock
down
the
old
stable
and
i
felt
that
it
be
probably
the
first
time
in
the
career
of
this
great
horse
lover
that
he
have
ever
consent
to
such
a
sacrilege
where
be
the
small
exclusive
house
of
my
dream
now
i
be
slightly
overcome
by
the
consequence
of
my
sudden
rise
to
fame
and
inclined
to
regret
the
transformation
of
my
original
modest
conception
into
something
so
much
vaster
all
the
same
i
be
human
enough
to
enjoy
be
a
success
and
after
all
presumably
the
aim
of
one
s
labour
be
to
succeed
so
i
have
no
legitimate
grievance
i
must
hasten
to
say
that
all
my
pleasure
arose
from
the
fact
that
my
dress
be
be
appreciate
by
the
public
and
the
hard
work
of
the
little
community
at
avenue
montaigne
be
therefore
reward
i
disliked
intensely
the
other
side
of
the
picture
the
inevitable
gossip
true
or
untrue
which
be
retail
about
me
and
the
sly
curious
whisper
which
my
presence
arouse
whenever
i
be
recognize
in
public
it
be
christian
b
rard
who
provide
the
fitting
climax
of
my
triumphant
first
season
in
the
course
of
a
dinner
give
by
marie
louise
bousquet
b
b
have
do
me
a
pastel
draw
of
the
house
in
avenue
montaigne
which
i
henceforth
have
reproduce
on
everything
from
christmas
card
to
the
programme
of
the
collection
at
the
dinner
he
propose
a
wonderful
improvised
toast
to
me
which
sum
up
all
the
vigour
of
his
own
philosophy
of
life
my
dear
christian
he
conclude
savour
this
moment
of
happiness
well
for
it
be
unique
in
your
career
never
again
will
success
come
to
you
so
easily
for
tomorrow
begin
the
anguish
of
living
up
to
and
if
possible
surpass
yourself
at
the
time
i
listen
to
his
word
without
take
in
their
meaning
the
poison
of
success
have
not
yet
have
time
to
work
in
my
vein
but
very
soon
b
rard
be
to
be
prove
right
as
usual
at
last
i
be
free
to
take
a
holiday
and
let
mind
and
body
recover
from
the
exhaust
effect
of
the
past
few
month
i
set
off
for
the
touraine
rejoice
in
my
liberty
although
this
be
france
have
take
a
long
time
to
lick
her
wound
and
it
still
seem
like
wartime
in
the
country
tank
have
broken
the
surface
of
the
road
which
have
not
yet
be
mend
i
be
irretrievably
bore
by
everything
mechanical
so
that
i
have
never
learnt
to
drive
as
i
have
never
be
rich
enough
to
employ
a
chauffeur
i
have
never
have
a
car
of
my
own
fortunately
suzanne
luling
offer
to
lend
me
her
gallant
little
simca
because
car
be
not
to
be
have
in
those
day
and
a
friend
of
mine
suggest
that
he
should
drive
me
the
simca
have
only
escape
be
requisition
by
both
french
and
german
by
a
series
of
cunning
stratagem
now
it
be
brought
proudly
out
of
retirement
that
be
to
say
it
get
as
far
as
the
garage
door
it
then
occur
to
me
that
this
wonder
car
have
possibly
be
spar
because
it
be
not
worth
a
brass
farthing
to
anyone
with
old
tyre
and
an
asthmatic
engine
it
advanced
painfully
in
a
series
of
noisy
burst
every
hundred
mile
we
come
to
a
standstill
there
have
be
a
puncture
in
one
of
the
tyre
so
the
tyre
have
to
be
mend
and
blown
up
off
we
go
again
only
to
find
two
hour
later
that
there
have
be
another
puncture
and
the
procedure
have
to
be
repeat
all
the
same
i
felt
i
be
bowling
along
in
a
triumphal
chariot
in
this
manner
we
do
eventually
reach
the
touraine
where
i
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
for
a
month
i
be
thankful
to
find
that
my
face
be
unknown
and
that
i
be
to
be
spar
the
autograph
book
in
which
i
could
never
think
of
anything
to
write
i
tour
the
small
hotel
of
the
district
enjoy
the
old
fashion
cuisine
which
in
spite
of
food
shortage
acquit
itself
with
honour
after
so
many
lean
year
i
have
practically
forgotten
what
it
felt
like
to
live
well
it
be
a
wonderful
holiday
i
felt
that
those
little
town
those
country
church
and
those
well
tend
garden
even
the
smell
of
simmer
stew
on
the
hob
epitomize
the
france
i
love
i
go
for
long
walk
on
foot
and
in
the
evening
either
played
patience
or
read
my
favourite
tome
of
historical
memoir
but
every
night
i
put
through
a
call
to
paris
to
keep
in
touch
with
what
have
happen
during
the
day
and
to
follow
the
dizzy
rise
of
price
i
suppose
my
norman
blood
prevents
me
ever
really
forget
completely
about
my
work
even
the
pleasantest
of
holiday
must
come
to
an
end
sometime
the
simca
breathe
its
last
in
full
view
of
the
tower
at
dourdain
so
i
rang
up
paris
to
hire
a
car
christian
dior
the
public
figure
now
come
into
his
own
he
be
photograph
from
every
angle
i
reflect
philosophically
that
it
be
the
price
of
fame
but
apart
from
my
dislike
of
the
whole
business
i
could
not
help
think
that
i
cut
a
sorry
figure
a
well
fed
gentleman
in
the
parisian
s
favourite
neutral
colour
suit
compare
with
the
glamorous
not
to
say
dandify
or
effeminate
couturier
of
the
popular
imagination
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
transform
myself
in
order
not
to
disappoint
my
public
perhaps
i
ought
to
go
on
a
diet
and
renounce
not
only
greed
but
everything
which
make
life
worth
living
i
splash
out
timidly
with
a
flower
in
my
buttonhole
i
order
several
more
suit
from
my
tailor
put
myself
in
the
hand
of
a
masseur
and
almost
immediately
give
the
whole
project
up
i
decide
that
the
gap
between
imagination
and
reality
be
too
wide
with
relief
i
sank
back
into
my
own
shell
which
have
come
to
fit
me
very
comfortably
after
so
many
year
i
be
in
the
midst
of
work
for
my
second
collection
the
winter
collection
to
be
present
in
july
when
i
receive
a
letter
from
an
american
fashion
house
call
neiman
marcus
invite
me
to
come
to
dallas
texas
to
receive
an
oscar
the
very
idea
of
such
a
journey
to
what
sound
like
the
end
of
the
earth
struck
terror
into
me
and
my
first
instinct
be
to
refuse
at
once
but
the
idea
of
get
to
know
america
be
too
tempt
to
be
resist
my
big
buyer
have
be
american
and
i
want
to
see
the
american
woman
who
be
wear
my
clothes
in
their
natural
surroundings
re
reading
the
letter
i
discover
that
the
oscar
have
be
institute
during
the
war
and
this
be
the
first
time
it
have
be
award
to
a
french
couturier
i
have
won
this
honour
with
my
very
first
collection
curiosity
and
pride
alone
would
not
have
be
enough
to
send
me
across
the
atlantic
what
really
spur
me
on
be
the
feel
that
it
be
the
revival
of
french
couture
which
be
be
honour
through
me
it
be
my
duty
to
reaffirm
the
ancient
supremacy
of
paris
in
the
field
of
fashion
and
represent
my
profession
and
my
country
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
set
off
until
i
have
present
my
second
collection
and
so
i
set
to
work
with
renew
energy
the
anxiety
which
b
rard
have
prophesy
gnawed
at
me
but
far
from
paralyse
me
it
inspire
me
to
fresh
height
it
be
a
crazy
collection
of
immensely
wide
immensely
long
skirt
the
new
look
push
to
extreme
dress
take
up
a
fantastic
yardage
of
material
and
this
time
go
right
down
to
the
ankle

could
safely
feel
that
they
have
all
the
trapping
of
a
fairy
tale

to
wear
a
golden
age

to
have
come

there
be
no
other

on
the
horizon
what
do
the
weight
of
my
sumptuous
material
my
heavy
velvet

brocade
matter
when
heart

not

down

still
much
too
much
of
a
novelty
for
a
poverty

to
develop
out
of
invert
snobbism
we
be
dizzy
with
success
and
nearly
involve
ourselves
in
a
catastrophe
for
a
totally
unexpected
reason
there
be

of

create
a
sensation
partly
because
it
be
so
pretty
but
also
and
more
to
the
point
because
a
mistake
have
be
make
in
work
out
the
price
and
it
be
fix
at
a

less
than
what
it
cost

be
on
a
grand
scale
nevertheless
they
be
desirable
and
important
even
in
the
history
of
our
time
because
they
produce
the
authentic
sense
of
popular
enjoyment
europe

tire
of

and
now
only
want
to
let
off
firework
this
new
lease
of
joie
de

never
succeed
in
equal
the
frenzy
of
whose
echo
alone
reach
me
as
i
be
too
young
to
take
part
in
them
but
it
be
reassure
to
find
that
the
coarse
feast
of
the
black
marketeers
be
be
gradually
supersede
by
the
more
elegant
entertainment
of

profit
from
this
wave
of
optimism
and
the
return
of
an
ideal
of
civilize
happiness
i
insist
on
use
the
word
happiness
i
believe
alphonse
daudet
once
write
that
he
want
his
book
to
make
him
become
a
merchant
of
happiness
in
my
modest
role
of
couturier
i
pursue
the
same
aim
my
first
creation
be
call
name
like
love
tenderness
and
happiness
woman
have
instinctively
understood
that
i
dream
of
make
them
not
only
more
beautiful
but
also
happier
that
be
why
they
have
reward
me
with
their
patronage
there
be
only
one
note
of
melancholy
in
my
grateful
paean
of
triumph
i
have
to
renounce
a
whole
side
of
my
life
which
have
be
very
dear
to
me
henceforth
i
have
to
devote
myself
in
earnest
to
the
role
of
christian
dior
couturier
i
rehearse
it
with
some
success
during
that
brilliant
season
in
paris
before
the
fateful
moment
come
when
i
have
to
take
my
new
personality
on
tour
iv
an
innocent
abroad
in
the
u
s
a
in
spite
of
the
scorn
which
my
family
have
pour
on
the
fortune
teller
s
prophecy
that
i
would
travel
widely
it
have
already
come
true
to
a
certain
extent
before
but
although
i
have
even
go
as
far
afield
as
russia
in
i
have
never
left
the
confines
of
europe
to
reach
dallas
texas
i
have
to
cross
the
ocean
and
enter
the
new
world
i
decide
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
and
make
a
complete
tour
of
the
united
state
it
may
not
sound
a
particularly
bold
venture
in
these
day
when
people
travel
huge
distance
so
casually
but
the
thought
of
it
fill
me
with
trepidation
for
one
thing
although
i
be
begin
to
know
my
role
of
couturier
by
heart
i
knew
very
little
about
this
new
stage
on
which
i
would
have
to
play
it
i
have
see
so
many
different
thing
about
america
by
so
many
different
people
that
i
no
longer
knew
whom
or
what
to
believe
although
of
course
this
very
mystery
fill
me
with
excitement
somewhere
behind
a
composite
facade
of
skyscraper
grand
canyon
niagara
fall
petrol
pump
huge
dusty
desert
and
something
call
the
deep
south
create
in
my
mind
malgr
moi
by
film
magazine
and
picture
postcard
lay
the
real
america
what
would
it
be
like
my
ear
rang
with
slogan
hollywood
with
its
film
producer
and
star
be
not
america
the
american
who
come
to
europe
be
not
the
real
american
old
paris
friend
like
the
poet
archibald
macleish
and
the
musician
and
critic
virgil
thompson
be
not
characteristic
american
type
either
i
be
told
that
the
american
millionaire
i
might
have
met
be
anachronism
and
belong
back
in
the
age
of
go
with
the
wind
nor
could
the
gi
who
liberate
us
be
regard
as
true
american
because
everybody
know
that
men
in
uniform
behave
quite
unlike
themselves
i
gradually
form
the
picture
of
a
gigantic
country
inhabit
by
an
entirely
new
race
of
people
of
no
know
characteristic
or
habit
it
be
scarcely
reassure
so
in
order
to
rally
my
spirit
i
begin
to
dwell
on
a
series
of
deliberately
old
fashion
notion
which
i
felt
could
scarcely
lead
to
disappointment
i
reject
what
little
i
knew
of
steinbeck
or
hemingway
in
favour
of
the
early
film
of
charlie
chaplin
paul
muni
s
gangster
pearl
white
and
mary
pickford
i
even
go
back
to
fenimore
cooper
in
search
of
a
more
soothe
america
with
this
intellectual
armour
to
protect
me
i
bade
my
friend
good
bye
as
if
i
be
go
on
an
arctic
expedition
and
embark
on
the
queen
elizabeth
at
the
begin
of
september
with
a
heavy
heart
encumber
of
course
with
a
thousand
absolutely
essential
suitcase
it
be
the
first
time
i
have
ever
make
a
trip
on
a
great
ocean
liner
and
as
the
queen
elizabeth
lay
in
the
dock
at
cherbourg
she
seem
to
me
more
impose
than
mont
blanc
itself
but
in
spite
of
the
hideous
style
of
luxury
which
she
share
with
all
other
big
ship
the
queen
elizabeth
be
instantly
agreeable
to
me
i
have
a
spacious
cabin
and
a
pleasant
steward
besides
which
an
english
ship
reek
of
england
and
there
be
no
other
country
in
the
world
besides
my
own
whose
way
of
life
i
like
so
much
i
love
english
tradition
english
politeness
english
architecture
i
even
love
english
cooking
i
dote
on
yorkshire
pudding
mince
pie
stuffed
chicken
and
above
all
i
worship
the
english
breakfast
of
tea
porridge
egg
and
bacon
it
be
in
fact
by
far
the
most
agreeable
sea
cross
i
have
ever
make
among
the
passenger
be
ivan
patsevitch
alex
and
tatiana
liberman
and
bettina
ballard
i
knew
none
of
them
very
well
when
we
set
off
but
by
the
time
we
reach
new
york
we
be
firm
friend
and
i
could
not
have
hop
for
a
nicer
quartet
to
introduce
me
to
america
in
such
pleasant
company
my
habitual
shyness
melt
and
the
hour
slip
by
i
found
i
have
harbour
a
completely
erroneous
impression
about
life
aboard
an
ocean
liner
here
be
no
haughty
elusive
cosmopolitan
beauty
make
fleeting
appearance
in
the
even
draped
in
sable
it
be
true
that
the
horse
game
or
lotto
bingo
be
played
in
the
lounge
in
the
even
beneath
a
portrait
of
the
queen
paint
by
the
most
official
of
her
official
painter
but
the
people
who
played
although
undoubtedly
rich
be
neither
young
nor
smart
as
a
set
they
go
early
to
bed
and
the
only
concession
they
make
to
the
traditional
grandeur
of
the
queen
elizabeth
be
their
rather
antiquate
dinner
jacket
and
even
dress
i
for
one
do
not
repine
at
this
lack
of
the
gala
spirit
it
left
our
little
group
free
for
a
delightful
existence
of
sunbathe
bridge
and
gossip
which
inevitably
centre
round
new
york
but
to
all
my
question
it
be
the
city
of
new
york
itself
which
give
the
best
answer
when
it
appear
on
the
horizon
at
dawn
on
the
fifth
day
radiant
in
the
glory
of
its
indian
summer
little
by
little
the
first
rock
of
another
world
the
new
world
rise
out
of
the
sea
at
the
top
of
the
rock
stood
an
enormous
city
its
base
still
shroud
in
darkness
but
its
summit
adorn
with
numerous
tower
of
babel
already
gild
by
the
morning
sun
the
zest
for
life
and
self
confidence
of
the
whole
nation
be
perfectly
conveyed
by
those
thousand
upward
point
obelisk
carry
away
by
my
enthusiasm
i
completely
forgot
the
ancient
continent
of
my
birth
how
far
away
now
seem
the
airy
structure
of
my
own
eiffel
tower
i
be
recall
to
a
sense
of
reality
and
mundane
problem
like
my
luggage
my
ticket
and
my
visa
by
the
siren
announce
disembarkation
men
in
uniform
from
park
attendant
to
swiss
guard
have
always
inspire
me
with
mingle
respect
and
fear
in
vain
do
i
remind
myself
that
my
innocence
have
be
establish
a
dozen
time
i
still
face
the
immigration
authority
with
all
the
guilt
of
a
stowaway
my
head
buzzing
with
story
of
their
notorious
severity
i
remember
the
absurd
question
i
have
be
ask
in
paris
how
i
have
have
my
fingerprint
take
and
be
force
to
swear
on
oath
that
i
be
not
a
communist
it
be
true
i
nourish
no
sinister
design
against
america
or
her
president
but
one
never
know
have
turn
out
and
search
my
pocket
for
my
passport
custom
declaration
disembarkation
card
luggage
check
and
vaccination
certificate
have
found
and
lose
them
again
several
time
have
finally
manage
to
grasp
the
whole
lot
in
my
hand
and
have
discover
the
right
queue
in
which
i
sat
down
and
stood
up
twenty
five
time
in
order
to
advance
one
yard
i
end
up
at
last
with
a
beating
heart
in
front
of
an
ominously
silent
gentleman
with
gold
spectacle
who
wave
me
politely
to
my
twenty
sixth
seat
he
take
my
paper
he
go
through
innumerable
long
list
devote
himself
to
a
minute
check
of
every
conceivable
detail
and
after
ask
me
how
long
i
intend
to
spend
in
america
finally
observe
with
a
know
wink
well
so
you
re
the
designer
what
about
the
skirt
length
i
be
convince
that
i
have
depart
from
the
ship
shroud
in
anonymity
i
be
also
astonish
to
discover
that
the
immigration
authority
be
so
intimately
interested
in
the
length
of
skirt
i
reply
in
rather
bad
english
that
after
all
i
have
not
make
skirt
as
long
as
all
that
and
rise
to
my
foot
overjoyed
at
have
escape
so
easily
the
new
look
have
prove
an
excellent
passport
for
its
inventor
i
now
begin
to
run
after
my
suitcase
as
though
the
steward
who
be
carry
them
intend
to
throw
them
into
the
sea
i
mistook
my
way
in
the
long
corridor
and
felt
so
totally
lose
that
when
several
microphone
start
to
boom
out
my
name
far
from
be
alarmed
i
heave
a
sigh
of
relief
thank
heaven
i
cry
on
hearing
these
enormous
echo
cry
of
dior
dior
they
ve
found
me
at
last
my
satisfaction
be
short
live
once
spy
and
identify
i
found
myself
hustle
into
the
grill
room
without
have
the
least
idea
what
be
go
on
and
face
with
an
impromptu
press
conference
it
be
my
first
experience
of
this
ghastly
ordeal
to
which
i
have
since
get
accustom
it
be
like
be
a
prisoner
in
the
dock
before
a
terrible
tribunal
with
the
courtroom
fill
with
flash
bulb
fire
at
you
before
you
even
say
a
word
on
this
occasion
i
face
the
grave
charge
of
wish
to
conceal
the
sacrosanct
leg
of
the
american
female
and
i
have
to
defend
myself
on
the
spot
it
seem
that
the
immigration
officer
s
wink
have
be
anything
but
benevolent
fortunately
my
native
norman
caution
get
me
out
of
a
tight
corner
pretend
to
search
for
word
in
my
halt
english
i
look
desperately
for
a
sympathetic
face
to
rescue
me
at
that
very
moment
as
in
all
the
best
melodrama
a
late
arrival
push
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
advanced
towards
me
with
open
arm
this
saviour
sent
from
heaven
at
the
critical
moment
be
none
other
than
nicolas
bongard
a
friend
of
twenty
year
stand
who
have
married
an
american
girl
and
settle
down
in

exquisite
taste

and
have
no
doubt
at
all
about
what

in
store
for
me
braving
the
rule
he
have
climbed
aboard
the
boat
to
come
to
my
assistance
thus
strengthen
i
take
heart
and
begin
to
reply
to
my
bombardment
of
question
my
two
day
in
new
york
be
spent
in
a
continuous
state
of
wonder
the
electric
air
of
the
city
kept
me
constantly
on
the
go
and
i
try
to
keep
my
eye
wide
open
the
whole
time
in
order
to
miss
nothing
of
my
first
impression
of
so
strike
a
spectacle
i
have
already
say
that
mechanical
thing
be
a
close
book
to
me
in
new
york
everything
be
mechanical
and
i
have
to
get
use
to
the
fact
and
adapt
myself
to
it
the
warmth
of
the
american
welcome
be
not
a
myth
like
all
foreigner
i
benefit
from
it
and
derive
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
from
it
as
warmth
and
friendship
be
two
thing
i
cannot
live
without
i
quickly
make
the
acquaintance
of
mme
engel
who
at
the

of
the

and

good
friend
of
mine
finally
i
set
off
for
dallas
i
have
no
idea
what
to
expect
of
a
town
which
answer
to
such
a
romantic
name
in
fact
dallas
be
a
massive
block
of
skyscraper
grouped
round
a
square
so
that
the
church
the
town
hall
the
school
and
the
hotel
be
situate
exactly
like
the
same
institution
in
a
french
village
except
that
the
height
of
everything
be
multiply
twenty
or
thirty
time
these
skyscraper
be
occupy
by
bank
and
office
of
all
sort
naturally
there
be
numerous
petrol
company
they
be
surround
by
residential
district
of
charm
house
built
in
a
familiar
architectural
style
separate
one
from
the
other
by
stretch
of
green
lawn
and
well
care
for
garden
but
when
one
examines
the
structure
of
dallas
seriously
one
realizes
that
its
real
singularity
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
be
construct
around
a
smart
shop
one
of
the
most
luxurious
in
the
whole
of
the
united
state
this
extraordinary
establishment
which
owes
its
foundation
to
the
genius
of
the
family
of
neiman
marcus
offer
the
most
expensive
thing
in
the
world
to
the
richest
people
in
the
world
european
reader
may
perhaps
be
surprised
to
learn
that
this
one
neiman
marcus
shop
be
enough
to
make
dallas
famous
in
the
four
corner
of
the
united
state
in
france
something
parallel
occurs
when
a
tiny
village
achieves
fame
through
one
gastronomic
speciality
i
do
not
arrive
in
dallas
alone
i
have
a
french
mentor
with
me
andr
janet
who
have
live
many
year
in
america
his
task
be
to
smooth
both
my
journey
and
my
stay
in
dallas
first
of
all
he
told
me
that
the
celebrate
hollywood
dress
designer
irene
and
the
famous
italian
shoemaker
salvatore
ferragamo
would
be
receive
oscar
at
the
same
time
as
me
the
idea
of
this
trade
union
of
oscar
winner
do
something
to
calm
my
apprehension
but
janet
then
proceed
to
double
my
fear
by
tell
me
that
i
would
receive
the
prize
on
a
golden
platform
in
front
of
three
thousand
people
it
would
be
a
silver
plaque
mount
on
ebony
which
be
to
be
award
to
me
for
my
service
in
the
field
of
fashion
and
horror
i
would
then
have
to
make
a
short
speech
in
english
it
be
extremely
hot
in
dallas
but
when
i
heard
this
news
i
go
cold
all
over
that
night
i
slept
very
badly
the
next
day
amongst
other
novelty
i
discover
for
the
first
time
what
in
fact
turn
out
to
be
my
daily
menu
during
the
course
of
my
tour
pile
of
sandwich
cold
turkey
and
iced
ham
cooked
in
sugar
in
the
virginian
fashion
which
luckily
i
happen
to
like
very
much
the
whole
meal
gulped
down
while
stand
up
and
wash
down
with
orangeade
since
there
be
no
hope
of
a
glass
of
wine
and
i
detest
both
iced
water
and
iced
milk
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
even
after
a
giddy
round
of
cocktail
party
i
finally
found
myself
sit
down
but
ala
on
the
famous
gild
platform
face
the
aforesaid
three
thousand
spectator
the
central
hall
of
the
marcus
shop
be
entirely
hung
with
golden
lam
and
transform
into
a
garden
of
the
hesperides
by
a
forest
of
orange
tree
hung
with
their
own
fruit
as
the
orchestra
struck
up
model
girl
wear
my
dress
start
to
file
past
by
the
end
of
the
afternoon
i
be
worn
out
try
to
convince
my
questioner
that
the
principal
attraction
and
novelty
of
the
even
dress
consist
in
the
well
displayed
bosom
marilyn
monroe
have
not
yet
be
launch
and
everyone
look
at
me
as
if
i
have
commit
a
terrible
error
of
taste
by
now
the
fatal
moment
of
the
presentation
of
the
oscar
be
almost
upon
me
my
co
laureate
have
already
be
honour
i
have
be
save
up
till
last
as
a
particularly
choice
victim
suddenly
just
as
m
ferragamo
be
receive
his
silver
plaque
my
terror
give
place
to
inspiration
what
be
i
make
all
the
fuss
about
i
a
parisian
couturier
abroad
who
would
be
expect
to
cut
an
eccentric
figure
in
any
case
have
always
enjoy
a
game
of
charade
i
decide
that
this
even
i
be
go
to
impersonate
a
certain
character
call
christian
dior
a
couturier
who
couldn
t
speak
a
word
of
english
and
have
to
stumble
out
a
speech
in
the
language
the
room
burst
into
roar
of
laughter
and
with
relief
i
descend
from
the
platform
i
have
not
disappointed
my
public
and
my
theatrical
verve
last
me
throughout
my
tour
of
the
united
state
i
left
dallas
with
many
feeling
of
regret
the
marcus
family
have
manage
to
transform
an
official
visit
into
an
unofficial
friendly
one
by
their
great
personal
kindness
to
me
it
be
one
of
the
most
praiseworthy
american
characteristic
to
be
able
to
pas
naturally
from
the
realm
of
business
contact
to
that
of
delightful
warm
hearted
camaraderie
i
now
prepared
myself
to
enter
a
considerably
more
familiar
world
california
the
earthly
paradise
of
which
all
american
and
many
european
dream
i
expect
a
perpetually
warm
climate
a
perpetually
shin
sun
a
profusion
of
tree
flower
and
wide
sandy
beach
wash
by
the
last
wave
of
the
pacific
breaker
in
fact
a
super
riviera
i
also
prepared
myself
for
los
angeles
with
its
film
star
and
beverly
hill
with
its
dream
like
luxury
to
this
mental
picture
i
add
the
vivid
mediterranean
colour
of
cannes
and
portofino
however
on
my
way
to
this
artificial
eden
arizona
intervene
with
all
its
savage
reality
which
defy
anything
i
have
imagine
grandiose
canyon
mountain
of
the
moon
petrify
forest
it
remind
me
of
the
picture
of
salvador
dal
there
be
the
same
range
of
cliff
paint
by
the
sun
in
every
colour
in
the
prism
and
look
like
frozen
rainbow
after
this
interval
of
inspire
tourism
los
angeles
and
the
pacific
coast
be
the
complete
opposite
of
what
i
have
expect
the
ocean
be
white
and
grey
not
blue
with
hideous
village
of
corrugate
iron
or
wood
chain
of
petrol
pump
and
ugly
villa
all
along
its
shore
as
for
los
angeles
so
charmingly
name
i
can
honestly
say
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
frenchman
use
to
logically
construct
building
and
town
built
accord
to
some
sort
of
plan
not
to
be
appalled
by
the
untidy
appearance
of
this
enormous
agglomeration
of
building
occupy
square
mile
but
if
los
angeles
be
not
what
christian
dior
have
be
expect
los
angeles
have
certainly
be
expect
christian
dior
for
a
press
conference
endless
visit
to
shop
lethal
cocktail
fork
lunch
fashion
show
and
even
a
shower
of
anonymous
letter
write
by
the
enemy
of
the
liberate
bosom
of
round
hip
of
long
skirt
in
short
of
the
new
look
unperturbed
i
face
a
battery
of
flash
bulb
i
smile
shook
hand
drank
orangeade
and
increase
my
self
confidence
in
the
role
which
i
have
recently
create
for
myself
in
dallas
by
contrast
i
found
beverly
hill
more
peaceful
than
i
have
hop
the
film
star
be
mostly
away
on
holiday
and
the
town
be
peaceful

recommend
to
me
by
lady

me
a
series
of
warm
welcome
in
delightful
house
i
met
ren
clair
and
his
wife
brognia
again
and
found
they
have
brought
all
the
atmosphere
of
distant
france
with
them
i
discover
real
friend
a
rare
piece
of
good
luck
in
the
grove
and
jane
magnin
i
be
take
to
see
the
film
studio
of
th
century
fox
when
i
left
this
factory
of
illusion
i
personally
have
none
left
and
i
thanked
my
lucky
star
that
i
earn
my
living
in
the
more
solid
sphere
of
fashion
but
if
los
angeles
be
not
to
my
taste
the
californian
countryside
delighted
me
stretch
of
green
velvet
embroider
with
orange
tree
and
lemon
tree
it
have
all
the
luxuriance
of
normandy
and
the
campanie
see
in
the
clear
light
of
the
c
te
basque
the
west
coast
american
seem
to
me
to
be
like
the
swiss
and
divide
into
two
camp
in
switzerland
there
be
the
fan
of
basel
and
the
fan
of
z
rich
the
american
divide
into
the
san
franciscan
and
the
los
angelists
let
me
say
at
once
that
i
be
a
san
franciscan
this
city
whose
hill
be
scatter
with
house
paint
pink
pale
green
and
yellow
which
be
flank
on
three
side
by
water
and
have
thrown
across
its
bay
the
dizziest
of
bridge
offer
in
a
single
bouquet
the
charm
of
naples
istanbul
china
and
luna
park
fun
fair
it
owes
this
last
characteristic
to
its
street
sheer
precipice
with
a
gradient
of
in
which
have
step
as
pavement
and
funicular
as
tramway
car
ascend
or
descend
them
like
sledge
on
the
russian
mountain
do
i
say
that
it
be
its
luna
park
aspect
which
i
like
best
of
all
the
scenic
railway
and
the
water
chute
make
my
childhood
a
misery
but
san
francisco
be
so
beautiful
that
i
finish
by
even
love
the
memory
of
my
childish
dizziness
moreover
the
temperature
there
all
the
year
round
be
air
condition
both
fresh
and
gently
moist
a
huge
crowd
of
people
greet
me
at
the
aerodrome
i
also
found
a
heap
of
invitation
wait
for
me
which
left
me
with
the
horrid
problem
of
try
to
please
everyone
without
offend
anyone
i
be
give
the
symbolic
key
of
the
town
in
a
golden
box
at
one
club
while
a
number
of
people
wait
at
another
club
annoyed
at
not
see
me
turn
up
for
the
same
ceremony
but
the
easy
go
happy
italianate
atmosphere
of
san
francisco
make
it
seem
simple
to
sort
the
various
confusion
out
i
get
through
all
the
function
impose
on
me
by
politeness
or
commercial
good
sense
quickly
but
conscientiously
then
with
a
feel
of
liberation
i
set
out
to
explore
the
city
from
top
to
bottom
i
love
feel
i
be
chinese
as
i
wander
through
the
street
of
chinatown
deck
with
shop
sign
as
allure
as
they
be
incomprehensible
the
shop
reveal
strange
marvel
to
me
which
should
have
grace
the
cupboard
of
an
amateur
scientist
in
the
eighteenth
century
mermaid
mushroom
wizard
egg
shark
fin
mandragora
root
everything
for
the
amateur
alchemist
i
like
to
feel
myself
spanish
under
the
paving
of
the
yellow
and
green
paint
church
on
the
top
of
the
hill
neapolitan
as
i
wander
through
the
dock
district
french
at
the
extreme
point
of
the
bay
visit
the
corot
and
the
nattiers
exhibit
in
an
exact
replica
of
the

of
which

one
other
pleasure
san
francisco
afford
me
i
left
it
with
regret
because
my
stay
have
be
so
short
but
some
french
friend
of
mine
who
visit
it
later
told
me
that
a
whole
case
in
the
city
s
museum
of
art
and
history
contains
a
permanent
exhibition
of
several
of
my
model
from
san
francisco
i
go
by
train
to
chicago
what
a
train
its
coach
be
as
comfortable
as
the
apartment
of
a
palace
but
as
depress
as
room
in
a
hospital
they
also
have
the
irritate
quality
of
be
too
light
in
weight
so
that
they
swayed
without
stop
as
i
bumped
and
jolt
through
the
splendour
of
the
californian
scenery
already
familiar
to
me
from
gangster
film
and
the
novel
of
sinclair
lewis
i
try
to
prepare
myself
for
the
monotony
of
yet
another
press
conference
fortunately
i
have
end
by
see
the
funny
side
of
these
ludicrous
cross
examination
which
force
you
to
ponder
heavily
on
action
which

search
their
ingenuous
brutality
also
obliges
one
to
evolve
a
new
form
of
politeness
the
rule
of
the
game
be
that
you
have
to
reply
in
the
sense
expect
by
your
interviewer
without
be
rude
at
the
slightest
sign
of
difficulty
you
change
the
subject
the
art
lie
in
manage
to
be
amuse
at
the
same
time
either
by
what
one
say
or
by
one
s
behaviour
the
question
be
the
same
the
world
over
they
ask
you
be
the
woman
here
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
i
invariably
reply
that
french

at
all
bad
either

what
will
be
the
trend
of
your
next
collection
to
the
last
question
i
generally
reply
very
innocently
that
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
which
be
generally
true
and
even
if
it
isn
t
it
give
me
an
excellent
excuse
for
keep
silent
in
the
train
which
bore
me
towards
chicago
i
recapitulate
my
joke
and
practise
my
expression
and
gesture
thus
prepared
i
await
the
entry
to
the
station
without
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
imagine
how
surprised
i
be
to
see
the
same
anxiety
from
which
i
have
just
be
liberate
stamp
on
the
face
of
those
about
to
interview
me
they
hustle
me
towards
the
wait
car
it
be
only
when
the
door
be
close
that
my
guard
give
a
sigh
of
relief
as
if
we
have
all
escape
arrest
they
then
explain
to
me
that
because
the
train
have
be
late
i
have
to
dress
in
a
hurry
in

to
their
reputation

in
fact
the
most
leisured
people
in
the

i
be
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
mad
haste
it
be
only
when
i
arrive
at
the
reception
that
i
understood
the

as
no

me
but
their
precaution

the
best
possible

do
not

what
sort
of
mental
image
they
have

probably
on
the
look
out
for
a

at
any

through

not
the

will
openly

in

i
found
again
that
english
way
of
life
which
i
love
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
the
remarkable
museum

university
french
student
condemn
to
haunt
our
own
deliberately
austere
faculty
would
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
their
comfort
and
beauty
finally
i
return
to
new
york
the
begin
and
end
of
my
journey
at
the
start
i
have
only
pass
through
it
and
knew
no
more
of
the
city
than
the
average
american
who
drive
smartly
through
paris
know
of
it
i
enjoy
look
up
many
of
my
old
friend
who
have
land
up
there
during
the
war
and
decide
to
make
it
their
home
they
taught
me
to
know
understand
and
love
new
york
the
city
to
which
i
have
since
return
twenty
time
and
which
be
now
almost
as
much
home
to
me
as
paris
the
first
discovery
i
make
be
that
new
york
one
of
the
great
capital
of
the
world
be
in
fact
nothing
but
a
village
it
be
also
a
village
with
strict
geographical
limit
consist
of
twenty
street
within
which
there
be
five
hotel
three
restaurant
and
four
night
club
there
and
there
only
will
you
find
the
three
hundred
people
who
make
up
new
york
and
as
the
problem
of
go
any
way
by
car
have
become
insoluble
you
will
meet
them
every
day
stroll
along
the
pavement
exactly
as
one
parade
along
the
boulevard
in
paris
if
you
stray
far
from
fifth
avenue
and
park
avenue
you
leave
the
village
you
risk
lose
yourself
immediately
in
harlem
in
downtown
or
on
the
west
side
the
district
where
nobody
be
suppose
to
live
which
be
a
pity
as
it
contains
some
very
pretty
house
of
course
there
be
absolutely
no
question
of
living
in
brooklyn
it
seem
much
far
away
than
connecticut
or
long
island
which
be
actually
far
more
distant
but
be
admissible
residential
area
for
caf
society
caf
society
in
new
york
be
as
exclusive
as
an
english
club
its
member
frequent
the
five
hotel
the
three
restaurant
and
the
four
nightclub
already
mention
they
only
meet
each
other
and
never
go
outside
the
three
territory
which
be
limited
by
on
one
side
fifth
avenue
and
the
east
river
and
on
the
other
approximately
by
th
and
th
street
these
frontier
be
in
fact
so
precisely
define
that
i
apologize
if
i
have
in
fact
give
them
inaccurately
have
no
memory
for
number
more
strictly
enclose
within
its
boundary
than
the
emperor
of
china
in
his
forbidden
city
or
the
pope
in
the
vatican
caf
society
life
in
the
shadow
of
its
skyscraper
as
french
villager
live
in
the
shadow
of
the
tree
of
their
market
square
the
financier
can
go
every
day
to
wall
street
the
smart
woman
can
depart
every
weekend
for
long
island
or
go
to
europe
but
their
private
life
cannot
be
live
anywhere
else
except
within
these
sacred
limit
the
result
of
this
fidelity
be
that
one
always
find
the
same
face
in
the
same
place
you
get
use
to
them
and
they
get
use
to
you
and
you
soon
have
the
agreeable
sensation
of
have
be
accepted
by
them
in
spite
of
this
delightful
contact
with
caf
society
i
push
my
investigation
far
into
the
american
way
of
life
knowledge
of
which
i
consider
indispensable
for
every
denizen
of
the
twentieth
century
as
my
stay
reach
its
end
i
felt
increasingly
a
confuse
but
nevertheless
tenacious
desire
to
return
to
new
york
some
day
to
achieve
something
there
and
win
a
place
for
myself
in
this
eldorado
mixed
with
this
feel
be
the
vague
wish
common
to
many
european
in
to
plant
one
foot
in
america
while
keep
the
other
in
the
old
world
with
time
i
have
discover
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
live
permanently
far
from
my
own
country
but
as
a
contrast
the
pleasure
of
revisit
new
york
remains
always
as
great
as
ever
the
french
often
picture
new
york
as
a
conglomeration
of
skyscraper
and
street
meeting
at
right
angle
in
truth
the
geometry
of
the
town
be
of
infinite
variety
but
consists
of
geometry
in
space
it
do
not
exist
in
plan
but
in
volume
the
most
strike
feature
of
the
city
be
the
juxtaposition
of
infinitely
tall
house
with
those
which
be
infinitely
small
of
luxurious
quarter
with
slum
this
juxtaposition
which
do
not
seem
to
worry
anybody
be
effect
with
no
feel
of
transition
my
passion
for
antique
furniture
take
me
into
the
antique
district
and
then
i
want
to
explore
greenwich
village
which
play
the
role
in
new
york
of
montmartre
and
montparnasse
in
paris
stroll
about
the
street
often
take
me
to
the
west
side
and
one
sunday
morning
i
even
reach
wall
street
a
great
silent
and
desert
nave
float
in
the
sabbath
calm
like
a
strand
cathedral
as
taxi
in
new
york
can
only
be
take
by
storm
one
go
far
on
foot
there
than
in
any
other
city
in
the
world
now
i
come
to
the
question
which
i
have
be
ask
a
thousand
time
and
i
know
perfectly
well
my
reader
be
wait
for
me
to
answer
what
do
you
think
of
american
woman
my
answer
will
probably
both
surprise
and
disappoint
you
the
blonde
and
willowy
woman
whom
hollywood
delight
to
exhibit
to
us
i
find
not
in
any
way
essentially
different
from
their
european
sister
when
andr
siegfried
return
to
new
york
after
the
war
he
be
amaze
to
no
longer
find
the
monumental
cumbersome
actress
type
american
beauty
which
he
have
found
at
the
end
of
the
precede
century
the
american
female
have
change
her
physical
type
since
then
he
conclude
in
fact
in
there
exist
one
essential
difference
between
the
woman
of
the
old
world
and
the
new
which
have
be
greatly
reduce
since
in
american
woman
have
all
the
shiny
brilliance
of
a
new
penny
their
clothes
be
impeccable
their
hair
and
their
nail
be
impeccable
their
shoe
be
impeccable
in
short
the
american
be
impeccable
it
be
true
of
all
class
of
society
from
the
millionaire
down
to
the
liftman
s
daughter
if
i
would
have
have
my
compatriot
emulate
some
of
this
impeccability
i
must
at
the
same
time
admit
that
in
the
end
all
this
perfection
give
an
impression
of
uniformity
however
in
order
to
struggle
against
it
all
the
resource
of
a
rich
and
variegate
collection
of
ready
make
clothes
be
mobilize
with
very
often
regrettable
lack
of
discernment
a
hat
bought
here
a
coat
there
a
dress
somewhere
else
pretty
enough
in
themselves
make
up
an
outfit
perhaps
but
not
an
ensemble
i
realize
that
the
clear
vibrant
air
of
new
york
justifies
in
some
part
these
bold
essay
of
colour
which
start
on

on
to
the

of
the

the
hideous
tie
of
the
driver

all
appear
to
be
battling
against
each
other
a
certain
taste
for
exaggeration
nullifies
the
american
elegance
but
time
have
change
america
have
renounce
its
excess
just
as
france
have
renounce
its
zazou
folly
for
its
part
france

be
able
to
dress
itself
with
more
care
and
benefit
from
a
great
variety
of

at

america

its

these

under

for

to

without

with
the

the

have
change
the
taste
for
subtle
colour
the
smartest
of
all
taste
have
developed
what
alarmed
me
most
in
the
course
of
my
stay
in
the
united
state
be
the
habit
of
spending
enormous
sum
of
money
in
order
to
achieve
so
little
real
luxury
america
thus
realize
the
idea
of
soviet
russia
represent
the
triumph
of
the
quantitative
over
the
qualitative
men
and
woman
both
prefer
buying
a
multitude
of
mediocre
thing
to
acquire
a
few
carefully
chosen
article
the
american
woman
faithful
to
the
ideal
of
optimism
which
the
united
state
seem
to
have
make
their
rule
of
life
seem
to
spend
money
entirely
in
order
to
gratify
the
collective
need
to
buy
she
prefers
three

to
one

one
she
never
hang
back
from
make
a
choice

perfectly
well
that
her
fancy
will
be
of
short
duration
and
the
dress
which
she
be
in
the
process
of
buying
will
be
jettison
very
soon
in

of
all
this
the
woman
of
new

be
marvellously
protect
against
error
of

them
the

of

them
the
complete
run
of
the
creation
of
every

in
spite
of
that
we
still
say
in
europe
that
they
do
not
know
how
to
buy
we
be
in
the
habit
of
buying
something
because
we
think
it
beautiful
or
of
good
workmanship
and
we
consider
the
use
we
will
put
it
to
as
much
as
its
appearance
can
one
therefore
conclude
that
abundance
risk
blunting

an
astonish
magic
wand
a
woman
who
can
only

go
to
such
trouble
to
choose
it
that
she
make
a
good

she
very
often
achieves
more
elegance
than
the
woman
who
posse
several

on
america
do
not
bring
me
to
any
pessimistic
conclusion
we
live
in

we
do
and
nothing
be
sillier
than
to
turn

therefore
without

my
beloved
and
incomparable
sky
part
two
from
the
idea
to
the
dress
v
the
idea
at
the
risk
of
be
thought
soulless
and
in
spite
of
my
love
of
architecture
and
interior
decoration
i
must
admit
that
clothes
be
my
whole
life
ultimately
everything
i
know
see
or
hear
every
part
of
my
life
turn
around
the
clothes
which
i
create
they
haunt
me
perpetually
until
they
be
ready
to
pas
from
the
world
of
my
dream
into
the
world
of
practical
utility
how
then
be
a
collection
create
i
be
often
ask
where
i
get
my
inspiration
from
but
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
do
not
know
perhaps
a
psychoanalyst
who
be
also
a
dress
designer
would
be
able
to
make
some
useful
observation
on
the
subject
by
compare
my
successive
collection
with
my
emotion
at
various
stage
in
my
past
life
but
he
would
not
have
the
mass
of
document
which
people
fondly
imagine
that
the
couturier
search
through
for
inspiration
to
help
him
i
do
not
say
that
there
be
necessarily
anything
wrong
with
this
method
of
design
but
i
do
say
that
it
have
never
be
of
any
help
to
me
far
from
stimulate
me
an
exact
historical
source
in
front
of
me
curtails
my
imagination
a
particular
country
style
or
epoch
be
only
interest
for
the
idea
behind
them
look
at
an
old
design
might
incline
one
to
copy
it
without
fresh
inspiration
this
be
so
true
that
even
when
i
be
design
the
costume
for
an
historical
play
i
firmly
shut
my
book
once
i
have
consult
them
put
away
my
print
and
allow
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
elapse
before
take
up
my
pencil
that
be
the
only
real
way
one
can
recreate
in
the
spirit
of
the
century
where
the
action
be
suppose
to
take
place
an
exhibition
or
a
museum
be
important
source
of
inspiration
chiefly
with
regard
to
detail
fashion
have
a
life
and
law
of
its
own
which
be
difficult
for
the
ordinary
intelligence
to
grasp
personally
i
know
exactly
what
i
must
give
to
my
design
care
trouble
and
enthusiasm
they
must
be
the
reflection
of
my
everyday
existence
show
the
same
feeling
the
same
joy
the
same
tenderness
the
most
passionate
adventure
of
my
life
have
therefore
be
with
my
clothes
i
be
obsess
with
them
they
preoccupy
me
they
occupy
me
and
finally
they
post
occupy
me
if
i
can
risk
the
word
this
half
vicious
half
ecstatic
circle
make
my
life
at
the
same
time
heaven
and
hell
the
prime
need
of
fashion
be
to
please
and
attract
consequently
this
attraction
must
never
result
in
uniformity
the
mother
of
boredom
that
be
why
although
there
be
no
logic
in
the
development
of
fashion
it
have
a
kind
of
logical
sensitivity
which
obeys
one
or
two
reflex
reaction
or
confirmation
by
the
end
of
october
after
three
month
of
intensive
study
i
have
separate
that
which
i
still
love
from
that
which
i
no
longer
love
and
be
progress
rapidly
towards
that
which
i
shall
love
in
the
future
for
my
seasonal
love
affair
with
fashion
begin
on
the
very
morning
when
my
last
collection
be
present
to
the
public
hidden
behind
the
grey
satin
curtain
which
divide
me
from
the
salon
i
listen
eagerly
to
the
greet
accord
to
the
first
show
of
my
dress
for
this
be
the
moment
of
their
true
debut
like
certain
woman
they
only
spring
to
life
when
they
be
admire
that
be
why
i
cross
examine
the
mannequin
anxiously
about
the
effect
produce
by
certain
model
which
i
consider
particularly
important
i
open
my
ear
wide
to
the
opinion
of
others
my
friend
my
client
the
journalist
and
the
professional
buyer
they
all
contribute
something
of
value
to
the
new
fashion
which
be
conceive
in
the
confusion
of
congratulation
which
follow
the
first
official
show
of
my
previous
collection
one
s
sensitivity
be
acute
and
one
notice
the
least
nuance
in
the
reception
of
each
model
one
experience
tremendous
pleasure
from
the
triumph
of
one
model
a
pang
from
the
semi
failure
or
just
not
success
of
another
of
course
the
slightest
criticism
murmur
in
between
two
sip
of
champagne
can
arouse
a
burning
fire
in
my
breast
curiously
enough
in
the
great
ball
of
the
collection
it
be
sometimes
the
beloved
model
the
favourite
child
which
be
unjustly
wallflower
so
that
even
in
the
sweetness
of
success
there
be
some
drop
of
bitterness
and
disappointment
a
historian
like
my
friend
gaxotte
reckons
that
fifty
year
have
to
elapse
before
one
can
give
a
consider
opinion
on
any
event
but
i
never
have
more
than
three
month
in
which
to
reflect
on
my
past
collection
before
i
have
to
return
to
work
fashion
dy
young
write
cocteau
and
it
be
therefore
natural
that
its
rhythm
should
be
more
hectic
than
that
of
history
the
week
which
follow
the
first
show
have
a
decisive
influence
on
the
collection
which
be
yet
to
be
born
it
be
then
that
i
perform
my
ritual
self
criticism
in
which
i
be
assist
by
the
photograph
or
drawing
publish
in
the
paper
which
often
present
me
with
an
entirely
new
light
on
my
creation
a
detail
which
i
have
insert
without
think
and
which
have
become
lose
in
the
course
of
the
execution
of
the
dress
will
emerge
miraculously
under
the
pencil
of
the
artist
or
through
the
objective
lens
of
the
camera
as
a
result
of
a
curious
angle
or
unexpected
light
perhaps
these
revelation
be
a
proof
of
the
independence
of
my
creation
from
their
creator
even
more
useful
to
me
be
see
my
dress
live
upon
the
back
of
my
client
although
i
very
rarely
go
into
the
fitting
room
i
have
all
its
echo
sedulously
report
to
me
thus
i
be
kept
fully
inform
about
the
choice
of
the
professional
buyer
and
those
of
my
privileged
client
who
do
not
always
agree
with
my
judgement
supplement
by
other
report
from
the
workroom
these
report
weave
a
sort
of
net
on
which
i
have
to
embroider
the
theme
of
the
next
collection
for
all
this
time
i
be
meeting
my
dress
again
like
dear
friend
i
meet
them
all
the
time
at
dinner
and
ball
a
little
later
i
meet
them
in
the
street
already
get
far
away
from
the
original
because
they
be
copy
finally
i
discover
them
major
or
minor
travesty
of
my
original
conception
in
the
window
of
the
shop
but
even
the
copy
even
the
adaptation
which
be
more
like
deformation
be
of
use
to
me
in
term
of
a
certain
saturation
they
show
me
all
the
pitfall
into
which
i
have
fall
which
give
me
both
a
shock
and
a
lesson
every
woman
invests
a
dress
with
her
particular
personality
thus
a
model
worn
by
marie
look
quite
different
when
chantale
wear
it
one
extinguishes
but
the
other
transfigures
it
have
decide
on
the
difference
i
still
have
to
analyse
the
reason
for
it
that
terrible
calculate
professional
s
eye
which
i
apparently
posse
i
suppose
i
shall
never
lose
it
i
have
be
told
that
woman
feel
undressed
beneath
my
stern
regard
they
be
wrong
i
be
simply
redress
them
in
quite
different
clothes
but
even
this
harmless
intention
must
shine
out
of
my
eye
for
it
embarrasses
the
lady
i
be
speak
to
and
also
give
me
a
complex
once
i
discover
what
be
happen
but
i
apply
it
to
all
woman
to
close
friend
as
to
a
strange
woman
i
see
come
into
the
room
for
the
first
time
incidentally
my
professional
s
eye
also
inhibits
me
from
pay
a
compliment
to
a
pretty
woman
wear
one
of
my
dress
because
i
might
seem
to
be
attribute
to
myself
part
of
her
success
this
discretion
have
its
advantage
because
if
it
imposes
silence
upon
me
when
i
be
satisfied
it
also
allows
me
to
keep
silence
when
i
be
disappointed
i
have
sworn
to
mention
no
individual
name
here
because
it
would
be
unbecoming
to
turn
this
book
into
a
sort
of
concours
d
l
gance
but
i
should
just
like
to
take
the
opportunity
to
express
my
profound
gratitude
to
all
the
woman
who
have
give
me
so
much
pleasure
by
understand
how
to
wear
my
dress
if
i
worry
about
the
way
my
dress
be
worn
out
in
the
world
i
worry
equally
about
those
of
my
rival
which
teach
me
how
they
have
dispose
of
the
same
problem
which
face
me
it
be
strange
and
impalpable
this
influence
which
the
couturier
have
on
each
other
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
every
season
there
exist
spread
among
the
various
couture
house
two
or
three
pilot
model
create
either
by
chance
or
by
deliberate
choice
which
will
determine
the
trend
of
the
future
meanwhile
the
need
for
synthesis
make
the
newspaper
impose
an
artificial
unity
upon
the
season
s
fashion
the
apparently
prevail
trend
be
the
choice
of
the
journalist
and
the
client
the
exigency
of
distribution
and
the
modern
taste
for
slogan
accentuate
this
simplification
still
far
and
induce
all
woman
to
buy
more
or
less
the
same
dress
in
this
way
each
collection
contains
about
twenty
dress
which
become
the
best
seller
in
their
shadow
the
pilot
model
of
which
i
have
spoken
often
pas
unappreciated
but
the
famous
professional
eye
be
not
mistaken
every
couturier
take
advantage
of
it
in
order
to
pick
up
a
lesson
from
a
rival
or
to
decide
to
put
an
end
to
the
diffusion
of
a
certain
fashion
often
after
several
season
thus
condemn
it
to
vulgarization
and
finally
to
disappearance
one
can
only
say
that
these
be
the
model
which
truly
mould
fashion
and
distil
that
unique
air
of
paris
which
be
so
often
praise
otherwise
sobriety
of
elegance
and
rare
rightness
of
taste
be
surely
not
enough
to
explain
why
so
many
collection
each
one
hug
its
secret
tight
disclose
the
same
magic
formula
on
the
appoint
day
the
mid
season
collection
formerly
marked
the
passing
of
the
purely
critical
period
into
the
period
of
creation
three
month
after
the
major
collection
the
big
house
produce
a
remould
and
refashion
version
of
it
a
sort
of
digest
of
its
idea
these
mid
season
collection
be
intend
to
reawaken
the
interest
of
the
client
le
by
introduce
about
thirty
new
model
certain
of
which
accentuate
the
principal
tendency
of
the
big
collection
while
others
pave
the
way
for
something
new
but
as
the
season
grow
longer
and
specialized
hand
labour
rarer
this
type
of
collection
more
or
less
die
out
that
be
why
i
always
get
so
much
satisfaction
from
design
the
collection
which
i
do
for
my
new
york
house
it
fulfils
the
same
function
in
my
mind
as
the
mid
season
collection
do
before
the
war
proceed
from
a
theme
which
be
familiar
to
me
and
which
only
recently
have
completely
absorbed
my
energy
i
effect
revision
and
transformation
some
of
the
model
have
to
be
adapt
to
the
need
of
the
american
wholesaler
that
be
to
say
to
the
need
of
a
much
large
public
ordinarily
i
start
by
introduce
certain
simplification
but
if
one
work
in
the
grip
of
an
inspiration
which
one
have
already
fully
experienced
sooner
or
later
one
be
bound
to
look
out
for
new
and
different
element
to
incorporate
one
get
bore
with
recopy
that
be
how
a
transitional
style
be
gradually
effect
the
new
york
collection
be
far
from
be
a
mere
reproduction
of
the
paris
collection
nearly
always
several
model
in
it
presage
the
major
trend
of
tomorrow
s
collection
but
before
design
this
i
allow
myself
a
whole
month
of
meditation
and
mental
exploration
one
of
the
strangest
fact
about
the
couturier
s
profession
which
the
uninitiated
find
most
incomprehensible
be
that
a
fashion
be
always
decide
out
of
season
the
winter
collection
be
work
upon
in
the
season
of
lilac
and
cherry
blossom
the
summer
collection
when
the
leaf
or
the
first
snow
be
fall
we
couturier
be
like
poet
a
little
nostalgia
be
necessary
for
us
we
like
to
dream
of
summer
in
the
middle
of
winter
and
vice
versa
it
would
be
as
impossible
for
me
to
create
a
summer
dress
in
the
month
of
august
as
it
would
be
to
create
a
new
model
outside
the
context
of
the
whole
collection
equally
indispensable
for
the
creator
be
the
distance
which
separate
him
from
the
season
for
which
he
be
design
and
the
infinite
variety
of
the
complete
collection
back
to
the
actual
creation
of
my
collection
during
the
first
day
of
the
rest
which
i
allow
myself
torture
by
regret
caprice
and
curiosity
all
at
once
i
abstain
from
design
altogether
i
be
frighten
of
give
birth
to
premature
design
whose
insufficiently
developed
form
will
encumber
me
in
the
future
half
irritated
half
happy
at
what
i
have
already
decide
above
all
longing
to
put
my
thought
down
on
paper
i
spend
several
week
in
this
state
of
gestation
finally
i
retire
to
the
country
this
migration
resembles
the
journey
of
the
eel
to
the
sargasso
sea
or
the
gathering
of
penguin
on
their
island
when
i
set
off
i
already
know
that
between
the
first
and
the
fifteenth
of
the
month
i
shall
have
cover
endless
block
of
paper
with
a
crowd
of
tiny
hieroglyphical
figure
which
i
alone
can
decipher
i
scribble
everywhere
in
bed
in
my
bath
at
meal
in
my
car
on
foot
in
the
sun
in
electric
light
by
day
and
by
night
bed
and
bath
where
one
be
not
conscious
so
to
speak
of
one
s
body
be
particularly
favourable
to
inspiration
here
one
s
spirit
be
at
ease
there
be
also
the
element
of
chance
inspiration
stone
tree
human
being
mere
gesture
or
a
sudden
ray
of
light
may
be
bearer
of
little
whisper
message
as
leonardo
da
vinci
walk
in
the
florentine
countryside
he
observe
the
pattern
in
the
sand
or
the
sky
and
transpose
them
into
his
picture
in
the
form
of
patch
of
light
on
a
more
modest
scale
my
dress
take
shape
all
around
me
as
my
fancy
work
on
whatever
it
happens
to
see
suddenly
one
such
flash
of
inspiration
give
me
an
electric
shock
i
be
possess
and
embroider
endless
variation
on
this
one
theme
the
next
morning
it
be
the
turn
of
another
line
which
have
perhaps
come
to
me
during
the
night
to
give
me
the
signal
the
design
seem
to
hail
you
like
a
friend
encounter
you
in
the
street
when
you
be
on
holiday
you
tell
yourself
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
at
all
it
be
your
friend
as
you
run
to
meet
her
you
feel
a
sense
of
conspiracy
between
you
base
on
the
fact
that
you
have
always
know
her
on
the
whole
the
model
which
be
create
after
such
flash
of
inspiration
be
the
most
successful
one
of
all
little
by
little
the
pile
of
drawing
grows
demand
new
treatment
capable
of
explore
all
their
potentiality
finally
this
crazy
burst
of
scribble
come
to
an
end
then
i
behave
like
a
baker
who
know
when
to
leave
a
well
knead
pastry
alone
now
that
the
line
from
which
the
new
fashion
can
emerge
be
determine
i
stop
for
several
day
i
put
aside
all
thought
connect
with
fashion
the
revision
which
follow
this
interlude
gain
sureness
from
the
rest
which
i
have
have
i
examine
all
my
sketch
from
the
first
which
be
scarcely
more
than
rough
outline
to
the
last
born
where
the
shape
be
much
more
clearly
define
the
selection
take
place
more
or
less
automatically
i
sense
from
the
first
what
promise
well
the
worthless
element
eliminates
itself
next
within
the
space
of
two
or
three
day
i
execute
several
hundred
design
in
order
to
give
my
idea
a
practical
expression
idea
flock
into
my
head
one
after
the
other
a
single
sketch
start
off
a
whole
series
the
sum
of
these
drawing
constitutes
the
base
of
the
future
collection
and
now
i
be
in
haste
to
get
them
to
the
workroom
in
order
that
the
sketch
shall
be
transform
into
dress
up
till
now
i
have
only
discuss
the
actual
design
of
dress
when
it
come
to
give
them
a
practical
expression
it
be
time
for
the
thousand
hand
who
fashion
cut
baste
and
mount
a
dress
to
intervene
from
my
corp
of
helper
in
the
studio
down
to
the
young
apprentice
the
avenue
montaigne
becomes
a
hive
of
industry
for
now
i
put
my
sketch
pip
hot
into
the
hand
of
mme
marguerite
i
seat
myself
at
a
light
table
near
the
window
of
the
studio
surround
by
mme
marguerite
mme
raymonde
and
mme
bricart
suddenly
a
doubt
strike
me
the
optic
of
the
studio
be
different
from
those
of
the
place
where
i
have
be
design
they
recreate
immediately
an
atmosphere
of
work
of
exigency
even
how
will
my
design
which
i
think
now
be
so
familiar
to
me
strike
me
in
this
new
light
design
can
be
clumsy
or
precise
they
depend
on
good
luck
with
one
s
draftsmanship
and
one
s
mood
at
the
moment
of
creation
the
important
thing
about
them
be
that
they
should
be
expressive
the
great
mistake
of
the
fashion
school
be
teach
their
pupil
simply
to
turn
out
finish
drawing
or
abstract
pattern
in
order
to
excite
the
enthusiasm
of
a
premi
re
or
mine
for
that
matter
a
sketch
must
suggest
both
attack
and
allure
it
must
already
suggest
a
living
line
it
must
be
redolent
with
movement
my
preliminary
sketch
which
in
the
charm
if
archaic
language
of
couture
be
still
call
petite
gravure
have
be
simply
scrawl
down
and
do
not
give
the
detail
of
a
toilette
unless
it
incorporates
some
strike
new
feature
as
they
be
pass
from
hand
to
hand
i
comment
on
them
and
fill
in
the
picture
with
the
help
of
a
few
purely
technical
explanation
about
the
cut
or
the
lay
of
the
material
this
be
the
first
step
in
the
metamorphosis
of
the
sketch
into
the
dress
i
survey
the
sketch
again
in
the
light
of
the
reaction
of
my
faithful
counsellor
as
the
design
accumulate
a
certain
tendency
becomes
noticeable
one
halt
suddenly
in
front
of
one
of
them
and
exclaims
oh
i
love
that
one
it
be
pass
round
from
hand
to
hand
its
detail
be
carefully
study
then
we
all
turn
back
to
the
sketch
which
go
before
it
thanks
to
the
impression
which
the
last
sketch
make
upon
us
the
others
now
take
on
a
new
significance
in
the
majority
of
case
these
revelation
after
the
event
teach
us
the
same
lesson
it
be
the
simplest
line
the
most
self
explanatory
design
where
the
principle
of
the
dress
be
most
clearly
state
which
win
us
over
it
conquers
us
because
its
very
simplicity
exudes
vitality
over
and
over
again
in
the
course
of
our
study
the
word
expression
occurs
have
i
express
you
correctly
marguerite
asks
me
i
tell
the
premi
re
your
dress
have
not
get
the
expression
i
want
for
the
art
of
make
a
dress
from
a
design
lie
in
achieve
the
correct
expression
some
people
have
do
me
the
honour
of
find
in
each
of
my
successive
collection
a
signification
d
ensemble
in
all
humility
i
be
prepared
to
believe
they
be
right
although
the
couturier
be
naturally
anxious
to
sew
and
cut
well
he
feel
all
the
time
this
desire
to
express
himself
for
all
its
ephemerality
couture
constitutes
a
mode
of
self
expression
which
can
be
compare
to
architecture
or
painting
once
i
have
show
all
my
sketch
mme
marguerite
distributes
the
petite
gravure
accord
to
personal
preference
the
premier
and
premi
re
be
allow
a
certain
liberty
of
choice
for
after
all
one
can
only
express
with
justice
that
which
one
feel
with
one
s
heart
as
mme
marguerite
distributes
the
design
she
recapitulates
and
develops
the
point
which
i
have
make
to
her
if
i
happen
to
come
into
the
studio
when
she
be
in
the
midst
of
her
explanation
i
be
touch
to
see
the
interest
and
enthusiasm
on
the
face
round
me
everybody
seem
to
be
anxious
to
grasp
the
problem
pose
by
the
new
design
and
in
their
anxiety
not
to
let
the
least
detail
escape
them
even
the
most
experienced
of
the
premi
re
show
the
eagerness
and
freshness
of
a
beginner
like
sap
the
creative
idea
circulates
now
throughout
the
whole
building
it
reach
the
apprentice
and
the
seamstress
and
inspires
the
finger
which
be
work
on
the
toiles
in
short
the
finger
which
be
fashion
the
style
of
tomorrow
for
one
week
the
house
be
a
busy
hive
of
question
and
cross
question
everyone
work
out
his
own
solution
to
the
problem
of
the
new
line
and
compare
it
with
that
evolve
by
a
neighbour
worker
i
resolutely
refuse
to
interfere
in
this
process
i
believe
that
each
of
my
worker
should
be
left
free
to
work
out
his
or
her
form
of
self
expression
because
i
take
into
account
the
possibility
of
some
new
technical
discovery
in
the
course
of
such
experiment
the
premi
re
examines
her
appoint
sketch
pull
it
to
piece
take
it
away
with
her
get
the
feel
of
it
and
finally
drape
her
toile
around
a
dummy
figure
then
she
step
back
examines
the
effect
corrects
it
balance
it
and
often
entirely
destroys
it
in
order
to
start
again
after
several
fruitless
attempt
the
exact
meaning
of
the
material
becomes
apparent
to
her
and
the
dress
start
to
take
shape
an
assistant
be
then
call
to
pin
the
toile
which
be
still
only
draped
little
by
little
the
pile
of
sketch
diminishes
in
each
workroom
as
the
model
be
divide
up
among
the
most
competent
hand
i
bite
my
nail
and
in
order
to
have
something
to
do
i
choose
the
button
the
belt
the
accessory
and
the
jewel
to
be
worn
with
each
dress
i
also
choose
material
from
roll
which
have
be
order
several
week
before
an
almost
ritual
ceremony
which
i
will
describe
later
during
the
week
when
i
be
wait
for
the
toiles
to
make
their
first
appearance
i
involve
myself
in
these
various
activity
more
for
the
sake
of
calm
my
nerve
than
for
get
on
with
the
work
vi
from
the
toile
to
the
dress
the
new
collection
be
like
the
arrival
of
spring
in
the
studio
during
the
off
season
it
be
as
white
empty
and
gloomy
as
a
laboratory
now
the
piece
of
material
be
like
young
shoot
which
ripen
into
a
thousand
flowery
pattern
belt
hang
in
dozen
from
the
table
scarf
and
hat
clutter
up
the
shelf
under
the
blackboard
where
the
name
of
the
mannequin
be
write
in
every
direction
there
be
sign
that
the
new
collection
be
be
prepared
this
happy
world
of
wool
and
silk
be
sternly
guard
against
intruder
whenever
there
be
a
rumour
that
a
stranger
be
approach
veil
of
white
toile
be
flung
over
everything
cover
the
new
material
and
obscure
the
accessory
the
busy
workroom
be
transform
in
an
instant
into
a
peaceful
desert
salon
this
little
comedy
never
cease
to
amuse
me
when
the
veil
be
remove
the
studio
be
once
again
a
hive
of
life
and
the
great
day
approach
when
the
first
toiles
be
to
be
show
of
course
mme
marguerite
turn
faint
at
the
idea
of
show
them
to
me
and
the
premi
re
be
terrify
that
they
have
make
some
awful
mistake
even
i
myself
begin
to
wonder
what
these
dream
child
of
mine
will
really
look
like
when
i
be
actually
confront
with
them
what
follow
next
be
a
solemn
moment
for
us
all
the
first
toiles
generally
number
about
sixty
and
they
consist
of
reproduction
of
the
most
significant
of
the
petite
gravure
those
which
i
have
ask
to
see
at
once
now
at
last
i
do
see
them
two
or
three
of
my
mannequin
be
chosen
to
show
them
to
me
of
course
all
the
jeunes
fille
as
we
call
the
mannequin
who
work
for
me
be
both
graceful
and
pretty
but
inevitably
certain
of
them
inspire
me
more
than
others
undoubtedly
there
exists
between
these
girl
and
me
a
kind
of
sympathy
or
sense
of
affinity
which
i
imagine
obeys
the
usual
mechanical
rule
which
govern
these
attraction
for
one
must
distinguish
between
the
successful
and
the
inspire
mannequin
they
be
not
at
all
the
same
thing
since
i
see
my
collection
with
quite
different
eye
from
the
general
public
the
successful
mannequin
be
an
extrovert
she
carry
the
practice
of
the
model
very
far
she
have
to
empoigner
and
in
trade
jargon
enlever
the
dress
the
inspire
mannequin
on
the
other
hand
be
turn
inwards
and
for
me
alone
express
the
mood
tradition
and
line
of
a
dress
from
the
first
hour
of
its
creation
the
couturier
be
too
often
picture
gaily
dispose
the
fold
of
a
drape
upon
a
mannequin
this
happens
in
fact
extremely
rarely
one
only
build
a
model
after
long
hour
of
preliminary
labour
and
then
it
be
construct
on
a
well
plan
base
the
process
of
drape
the
dress
on
the
mannequin
cannot
take
place
until
all
the
cut
of
the
collection
have
be
satisfactorily
accomplish
the
first
show
of
the
toiles
on
the
mannequin
be
do
amidst
oh
and
ahs
equally
expressive
of
joy
and
disapproval
some
of
the
exclamation
be
more
explicit
darling
your
toilette
be
perfect
my
dear
for
heaven
s
sake
throw
that
dress
in
the
wastepaper
basket
when
a
toile
be
successful
one
personalizes
it
immediately
if
it
be
a
failure
it
be
just
that
dress
impersonal
and
contemptuous
phrase
very
often
the
model
which
captivate
us
now
have
be
make
from
sketch
which
pass
under
our
nose
quite
unnoticed
now
on
the
basis
of
this
new
inspiration
we
build
a
whole
new
series
of
dress
on
the
other
hand
other
sketch
which
apparently
promise
great
thing
only
produce
navets
which
be
speedily
eliminate
some
of
the
toiles
turn
out
quite
differently
from
what
i
have
imagine
they
be
not
necessarily
failure
but
the
design
have
be
misinterpret
in
some
way
the
premi
re
like
the
photographer
and
fashion
artist
later
have
read
into
the
design
some
project
which
i
have
not
intend
an
artistic
creation
which
depends
on
another
brain
for
its
interpretation
often
produce
some
surprise
for
its
author
this
applies
to
dress
as
much
as
to
play
it
be
up
to
the
designer
to
know
how
to
reap
the
best
advantage
from
it
therefore
if
the
outcome
be
satisfactory
i
let
the
model
go
forward
unless
i
decide
to
return
to
my
original
project
explain
the
design
far
or
hand
it
over
to
a
more
skilful
workroom
sometimes
i
entrust
the
same
sketch
to
several
different
workroom
conscious
that
i
will
thus
obtain
the
great
variety
of
expression
in
my
toiles
from
which
i
can
either
choose
the
most
successful
version
or
use
the
variety
as
a
pretext
for
new
departure
like
the
sketch
which
inspire
them
these
toiles
have
very
little
detail
their
importance
be
entirely
in
their
cut
line
and
shape
these
be
the
fundamental
toiles
on
which
the
whole
collection
be
base
detail
like
revers
bow
pocket
or
belt
be
add
later
unless
they
happen
to
be
indispensable
to
the
construction
of
the
model
the
day
when
the
first
toiles
be
show
be
the
crucial
day
in
the
whole
development
of
the
collection
now
i
be
able
to
select
from
among
the
model
i
have
design
five
or
six
basic
line
express
in
dress
costume
or
coat
next
i
call
a
grand
meeting
of
my
mannequin
i
have
them
all
appear
in
toilette
of
the
same
genre
all
in
even
dress
or
all
in
suit
the
session
continue
until
every
model
have
be
inspect
often
well
into
the
night
as
i
go
home
new
design
dance
in
front
of
my
eye
and
i
be
in
a
state
of
tumult
over
all
i
have
see
i
be
confuse
and
delighted
at
the
same
time
i
be
well
aware
of
course
that
this
first
moment
of
enthusiasm
will
not
last
long
and
hard
work
lie
ahead
before
these
tentative
approach
to
creation
become
model
worthy
of
the
name
the
next
day
find
me
in
a
more
sober
mood
and
i
decide
to
see
the
toiles
all
over
again
in
order
to
decide
which
be
to
be
the
significant
line
of
the
collection
i
have
the
model
parade
before
me
once
more
one
by
one
in
order
to
have
them
note
down
the
session
do
not
always
run
absolutely
smoothly
advice
be
bandy
about
freely
and
a
mannequin
be
sometimes
make
to
show
the
same
dress
two
or
three
time
sent
out
ask
to
come
in
once
more
only
to
find
that
the
model
be
be
try
on
another
girl
it
be
fatal
to
proceed
too
fast
for
one
run
the
risk
of
overlook
a
basically
excellent
model
which
be
temporarily
suffer
from
a
mistake
in
the
workmanship
it
be
only
after
mature
reflection
a
hundred
question
and
a
thousand
doubt
that
a
decision
be
finally
take
and
duly
note
down
by
mme
raymonde
too
often
people
believe
that
a
collection
develops
in
burst
of
enthusiasm
and
caprice
without
any
co
ordinate
plan
in
point
of
fact
it
be
always
built
up
along
line
which
have
be
establish
well
in
advance
mme
raymonde
draw
up
a
complete
chart
of
the
collection
on
several
large
sheet
of
paper
she
map
out
space
for
a
certain
number
of
day
dress
suit
coat
and
even
dress
i
force
myself
to
reduce
this
skeleton
plan
to
the
minimum
know
perfectly
well
that
we
shall
soon
break
our
bound
i
try
to
be
wary
of
the
seductive
pleasure
of
invention
which
lure
me
on
towards
fresh
creation
fully
conscious
that
certain
material
and
embroidery
which
i
have
already
put
aside
will
oblige
me
to
seek
new
design
other
than
those
already
in
existence
to
make
use
of
them
i
also
know
that
there
will
always
be
some
last
minute
dress
they
be
born
of
various
different
impulse
in
some
case
i
want
to
appeal
to
a
type
of
woman
or
figure
which
i
have
involuntarily
neglect
in
others
i
want
to
underline
some
detail
of
the
cut
or
the
design
which
i
find
to
be
insufficiently
illustrate
in
the
other
dress
in
the
collection
even
my
most
fanatical
client
and
admirer
agree
that
there
be
always
too
many
model
in
any
one
collection
they
be
absolutely
right
a
two
hour
show
without
an
interval
be
far
too
long
besides
it
be
always
too
hot
in
the
salon
but
though
it
be
true
that
there
be
far
too
many
dress
for
each
individual
woman
you
must
not
forget
that
i
be
address
myself
to
a
professional
client
le
and
also
client
of
vastly
differ
need
in
every
country
there
be
thin
woman
and
fat
woman
dark
woman
and
fair
woman
woman
of
discreet
taste
and
others
whose
taste
be
more
flamboyant
there
be
some
woman
with
a
beautiful
d
colletage
and
others
whose
aim
be
to
disguise
their
thigh
some
be
too
tall
others
be
too
short
the
world
be
wonderfully
full
of
beautiful
woman
whose
shape
and
taste
offer
an
inexhaustible
diversity
my
collection
must
cater
individually
for
each
one
of
them
and
if
i
really
want
to
satisfy
them
completely
i
should
have
to
design
not
seventy
model
but
at
least
seventy
time
seven
fortunately
the
chart
of
my
collection
be
there
to
keep
me
in
check
even
though
it
seem
to
be
act
like
a
straitjacket
on
my
imagination
at
last
the
moment
have
come
to
decide
the
toiles
which
have
be
judged
worthy
of
transformation
into
actual
model
have
be
classify
described
enumerate
and
roughly
sketch
by
mme
raymonde
now
i
have
them
parade
singly
in
front
of
me
one
last
time
the
next
step
be
to
indicate
which
mannequin
will
wear
which
dress
and
the
material
in
which
it
be
to
be
make
the
dress
and
the
mannequin
be
often
as
inseparable
one
from
the
other
as
the
dress
and
the
material
of
the
dozen
jeunes
fille
who
present
my
collection
three
or
four
of
them
can
put
on
anything
and
show
it
off
to
advantage
the
others
probably
belong
to
a
more
pronounce
type
of
feminine
beauty
for
them
i
have
to
be
careful
to
choose
model
which
will
harmonize
with
their
appearance
not
only
do
i
have
to
consider
the
physical
attribute
of
my
mannequin
i
must
also
be
very
careful
to
divide
the
model
equally
else
there
will
be
war
in
the
mannequin
cabine
each
girl
must
show
approximately
the
same
number
of
dress
and
in
make
up
this
number
a
just
balance
must
be
kept
between
day
dress
elaborate
toilette
and
even
dress
it
be
obviously
impossible
to
work
this
out
exactly
and
i
be
frequently
make
miserable
during
the
show
when
i
see
a
woollen
tailleur
parade
in
the
midst
of
a
series
of
more
formal
dress
or
a
short
even
dress
in
the
midst
of
a
flow
of
ball
dress
the
most
successful
model
cannot
stand
up
to
such
unfair
competition
but
if
the
choice
of
mannequin
be
important
that
of
material
be
even
more
so
because
once
chosen
it
be
very
hard
to
remedy
a
mistake
this
very
important
operation
take
place
in
several
stage
each
couturier
have
his
own
method
of
work
a
few
be
inspire
by
the
material
to
create
their
dress
but
the
majority
proceed
from
a
toile
which
have
be
construct
from
a
sketch
or
the
designer
s
instruction
personally
whatever
the
variety
beauty
or
novelty
of
the
stuff
which
be
displayed
to
me
they
be
always
a
secondary
consideration
when
work
on
the
new
collection
be
near
completion
and
the
new
line
be
finally
demarcate
in
my
design
i
do
allow
myself
occasionally
to
be
tempt
by
the
texture
the
colour
or
the
pattern
of
a
particular
material
i
drape
it
in
fold
there
and
then
as
long
as
i
be
convince
that
there
already
exists
a
satisfactory
basic
design
on
which
the
dress
can
be
found
my
prime
inspiration
be
the
shape
of
the
female
body
for
it
be
the
duty
of
the
couturier
to
adopt
the
female
form
as
his
point
of
departure
and
use
the
material
at
his
disposal
so
as
to
enhance
its
natural
beauty
i
have
no
wish
to
deprive
fashion
and
the
lady
of
the
add
allure
and
charm
of
colour
but
i
could
perfectly
well
design
a
whole
collection
simply
in
black
or
white
and
express
all
my
idea
to
my
complete
satisfaction
colour
cannot
transform
a
failure
of
a
dress
into
a
success
it
merely
play
a
support
role
in
a
cast
where
the
cut
be
the
star
performer
in
order
to
relate
material
to
the
general
background
of
haute
couture
i
must
digress
a
little
two
month
before
i
have
even
rough
out
my
first
sketch
for
the
new
collection
i
have
to
make
my
preliminary
selection
for
that
be
when
they
arrive
to
see
me
the
silk
merchant
the
wool
merchant
the
lace
maker
men
of
consequence
imbue
with
strong
tradition
who
come
from
all
over
the
world
from
paris
london
lyon
milan
and
z
rich
bring
with
them
the
wealth
of
the
low
country
and
the
richness
of
the
orient
i
await
them
with
my
two
assistant
designer
mme
raymonde
and
my
administrative
staff
at
my
side
it
be
like
receive
an
embassy
rise
to
our
foot
to
greet
the
ambassador
we
solemnly
shake
hand
and
in
order
not
to
get
on
to
the
subject
of
the
material
pile
up
in
the
corridor
too
quickly
we
chat
politely
about
the
precede
season
we
recall
those
stuff
which
have
go
well
we
give
an
account
of
the
sale
of
the
model
which
be
make
from
them
exactly
as
if
we
be
mutual
friend
impart
news
of
other
friend
whom
they
have
not
see
for
some
time
then
the
show
start
and
each
firm
have
its
characteristic
method
of
display
some
respectful
of
the
great
tradition
of
the
past
be
accompany
by
a
cort
ge
of
seven
or
eight
trunk
which
be
carry
in
by
bearer
like
gift
be
brought
from
far
off
country
by
eastern
potentate
the
head
of
the
firm
have
them
set
down
open
and
the
carrier
spill
out
the
multi
colour
piece
with
the
quickness
of
a
conjurer
his
deft
hand
spread
them
out
arrange
them
and
sort
them
in
a
few
second
i
have
before
me
a
rainbow
of
colour
all
equally
tempt
then
there
be
those
who
arrive
with
small
despatch
case
like
the
spiv
sell
bootlace
in
the
street
out
of
them
they
produce
tiny
sample
often
only
the
size
of
postage
stamp
and
one
have
to
rummage
to
find
treasure
particularly
in
the
spring
when
the
print
run
riot
gaily
amid
the
plain
material
which
be
the
basis
of
the
collection
all
this
lead
to
a
delicious
confusion
as
in
the
world
of
couture
itself
it
be
the
big
firm
which
supply
the
best
quality
colour
and
design
the
fabric
they
put
forward
naturally
influence
the
collection
which
be
to
come
but
they
themselves
have
be
suggest
by
the
past
collection
so
they
ensure
the
continuity
of
fashion
from
season
to
season
at
this
moment
i
have
no
idea
what
material
i
shall
be
want
in
two
month
time
paradoxically
enough
this
make
it
quite
easy
for
me
to
choose
instead
of
hesitate
between
what
i
think
will
be
useful
and
what
i
think
i
want
i
be
able
to
decide
between
what
plea
me
and
what
doesn
t
i
give
way
to
my
instinctive
reaction
contrary
to
popular
belief
it
be
rare
for
a
couturier
to
commission
a
material
specially
from
the
manufacturer
of
course
material
can
be
inspire
by
stray
conversation
between
couturier
and
manufacturer
and
by
desire
vaguely
express
several
month
before
for
that
very
reason
i
be
always
very
anxious
to
avoid
propose
theme
material
or
shade
of
colour
too
precisely
in
our
casual
chat
for
one
thing
i
be
well
aware
of
the
impermanence
of
my
own
whim
for
another
in
such
an
essentially
collective
business
as
couture
i
do
not
want
to
lose
the
benefit
of
the
interaction
of
many
different
idea
and
view
it
be
from
amongst
this
profusion
of
material
which
i
have
select
two
month
before
that
i
have
to
make
my
first
choice
in
the
interval
between
the
display
of
the
sketch
and
the
emergence
of
the
toiles
follow
by
a
second
for
the
more
exotic
fabric
first
of
all
i
eliminate
everything
which
definitely
do
not
please
me
and
which
be
therefore
encumber
the
studio
to
no
purpose
the
rest
of
the
stuff
continue
to
submerge
it
with
their
mount
wave
i
then
mark
my
favourite
with
a
cross
and
have
them
put
in
special
case
of
course
i
know
perfectly
well
that
i
shall
find
new
favourite
every
day
whose
charm
i
pass
over
at
first
and
which
all
at
once
i
find
irresistible
nevertheless
the
foundation
of
my
selection
have
be
laid
and
all
these
glisten
allure
roll
dangerous
by
their
very
beauty
be
now
control
and
categorize
by
colour
and
type
and
also
if
possible
by
the
manufacturer
they
inundate
my
studio
they
also
illuminate
it
surround
by
my
staff
i
now
concentrate
entirely
on
the
problem
of
the
mannequin
still
in
her
toile
amidst
all
these
engulf
material
there
must
be
one
which
suit
both
the
dress
and
the
girl
i
have
to
resist
many
insidious
temptation
sometimes
it
be
the
colour
which
attracts
me
sometimes
the
texture
of
the
material
of
the
two
the
latter
be
the
more
likely
to
captivate
me
because
i
never
choose
a
material
solely
because
of
its
exquisite
shade
of
colour
but
more
often
because
its
texture
seem
exactly
adapt
to
the
effect
i
want
to
achieve
a
number
of
factor
have
to
be
take
into
consideration
the
suppleness
or
the
body
of
the
stuff
the
weight
or
the
thickness
the
material
be
stretch
out
straight
and
on
the
cross
it
be
weigh
stroke
for
it
must
not
scratch
the
skin
rubbed
for
the
dye
must
not
come
off
and
examine
in
the
light
for
the
colour
must
suit
the
complexion
of
the
mannequin
who
be
go
to
wear
it
what
examination
what
test
it
have
to
pas
before
it
be
deem
worthy
of
be
chosen
there
be
probably
eight
or
nine
of
us
altogether
there
in
the
studio
face
me
stand
a
lone
mannequin

in
white
cotton

in

of
a

behind

designer
mme

busy
hunt
for
the
material
which
most
nearly
corresponds
to
my
scarcely
formulate
desire
with
the
help
of
claude
her
assistant
mme
marguerite

to
remain
at
my

but
cannot

still
on
her
chair
unable
to
mask
her
impatience
she
run
up
and
down
between
the
model
and
her
post
to
which
i
keep

mme
bricard
emerges
out
of
her
hatbox
sail
in
magnificently
give
one
definitely
adverse
comment
condemns
an
unfortunate
stuff
with
a
look
or
suddenly
plump
for
a
dare
colour
but
most
of
the
time
this
ritual
which
would
baffle
an
outsider
consists
of
choose
from
thirty
black
wool
all
of
excellent
quality
the
sole
one
which
be
in
fact
suitable
as
i
hesitate
between
the
rival
claim
of
the
various
stuff
which
be
submit
to
me
and
try
to
formulate
my
idea
in
turn
the
piece
of
material
be
draped
over
the
shoulder
of
the
mannequin
so
that
i
can
judge
the
softness
and
fall
of
the
material
in
relation
to
the
toile
which
be
still
visible
on
the
other
shoulder
certain
combination
be
obviously
immediately
unsuitable
oh
no
take
that
off
at
once
and
i
point
to
another
piece
of
stuff
this
one
instead
of
immediately
slide
off
the
mannequin
s
bust
stay
there
we
all
look
at
it
do
it
really
suit
her
it
certainly
seem
to
but
after
all
perhaps
not
so
i
ask
anyone
at
random
what
do
you
think
of
it
they
know
perfectly
well
that
i
do
not
really
want
to
hear
their
opinion
and
probably
don
t
answer
me
seriously
all
the
same
their
mere
presence
be
of
assistance
to
me
their
reply
whatever
it
be
crystallizes
my
doubt
i
press
them
far
and
you
boutonnette
what
do
you
think
of
it
boutonnette
nod
her
head
without
commit
herself
then
it
be
claude
s
turn
and
in
this
way
the
whole
room
join
in
from
mme
marguerite
down
to
the
mannequin
who
as
the
debate
continue
begin
to
feel
the
first
pricking
of
fatigue
the
choice
be
make
at
the
price
of
universal
tension
in
which
all
present
partake
it
only
need
the
indifference
of
one
person
to
destroy
the
whole
climate
of
passionate
collective
research
sometimes
the
decision
be
take
almost
at
once
sometimes
there
be
dozen
of
false
try
in
the
end
we
may
revert
to
something
we
have
previously
dismiss
as
hopeless
after
rummage
among
the
discard
piece
of
material
wretched
fabric
once
again
it
be
draped
re
draped
examine
and
reexamine
it
be
never

by
the

hand
twice
a
dozen
hand
be
there
to
wreak
their
will
upon

the

of
a

either

the

hastily
draw
on
a
corner

that

be
the
weight
and
feel
of
the

for
the

in

the

my

finally
i
decide
to
put
off
make
my
choice
until
the
next
day
once
i
be
at
home
i
find
myself
think
about
the
debatable
toile
in
the
middle
of
the
night
those
collection
haunt
night
which
turn
the
day
into
a
single
feverish
sarabande
the
next
day
i
do
actually
manage
to
reach
a
decision
in
spite
of
all
this
concentration
it
do
sometimes
happen
that
material
which
have
be
chosen
with
the
great
possible
care
be
found
to
have
kept
some
unexpected
revelation
in
reserve
when
the
dress
be
sewn
together
couture
be
the
marriage
of
design
and
material
there
be
many
instance
of
perfect
harmony
and
there
be
a
few
of
disaster
vii
the
birth
of
the
collection
practically
speak
it
be
in
the
course
of
the
ten
day
and
also
for
me
ten
night
during
which
the
selection
of
the
material
be
go
on
that
the
line
or
to
be
more
precise
the
line
be
decide
an
all
round
the
clock
collection
be
not
developed
on
a
single
theme
but
on
seven
or
eight
principal
motif
it
must
have
an
agreeable
variety
and
at
the
same
time
present
a
general
harmony
so
that
it
never
contradicts
itself
this
be
why
half
the
model
which
be
make
never
reach
the
actual
collection
our
first
enthusiasm
encourages
us
to
put
far
too
many
toiles
into
execution
later
we
have
to
destroy
a
great
number
of
them
now
the
model
be
put
through
the
intricate
process
of
construction
at
the
moment
when
life
be
about
to
be
breathe
into
the
new
creation
one
have
to
reconcile
two
apparently
irreconcilable
force
personality
and
discipline
the
workroom
fall
upon
the
toiles
which
have
be
allot
to
them
with
enthusiasm
there
be
interminable
telephone
conversation
with
the
manufacturer
this
length
of
material
have
turn
out
to
be
insufficient
more
must
be
supply
immediately
but
when
it
do
arrive
it
do
not

revise
and
corrects
mistake
meanwhile
i
await
the
result
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
my
anxiety
be
prolong
during
five
or
six
whole
day
neither
marguerite
nor
i
know
exactly
when
it
will
come
to
an
end
our
meeting
and
conversation
be
along
the
same
line
as
those
of
a
nurse
and
a
father
to
be
every
time
she
see
me
she
know
that
i
will
not
be
able
to
resist
put
the
inevitable
question
what
will
they
be
like
and
when
will
they
be
ready
finally
the
model
be
ready
and
on
the
one
day
i
have
not
expect
them
when
they
arrive
our
heart
be
in
our
mouth
for
whereas
the
toiles
have
the
charm
of
a
rough
sketch
leave
the
imagination
free
to
conceive
the
rest
what
we
be
now
be
face
with
be
the
grim
reality
i
must
say
at
once
that
we
be
sometimes
bowl
over
by
what
we
see
and
sometimes
appalled
most
frequently
we
calculate
with
irritation
the
work
which
still
need
do
before
the
dress
which
we
be
contemplate
approach
anything
like
the
figment
of
our
imagination
some
of
the
dress
have
be
irretrievably
ruin
we
find
them
indecent
we
almost
want
to
insult
them
because
they
seem
to
mock
us
there
be
cry
of
it
s
ghastly
it
s
an
outrage
into
the
wastepaper
basket
with
it
away
with
it
to
the
dustbin
on
the
other
hand
by
way
of
compensation
there
be
some
which
look
so
delicious
from
the
start
one
would
almost
like
to
hug
them
it
s
a
dream
we
cry
as
if
we
be
gaze
at
the
work
of
quite
another
hand
than
our
own
it
really
be
a
success
i
have
often
thought
what
an
extraordinary
impression
this
passionate
vocabulary
would
produce
on
the
ignorant
spectator
satisfaction
be
express
without
shame
disappointment
without
limit
in
order
to
understand
these
violent
reaction
you
have
to
have
share
our
joy
our
anxiety
our
hope
our
long
night
of
weary
but
painstaking
toil
you
would
then
have
no
doubt
that
ours
be
a
labour
of
love
i
now
seat
myself
once
more
in
my
chair
with
a
large
glass
in
front
of
me
i
have
each
new
entry
announce
to
me
by
the
rather
pompous
sound
phrase
monsieur
un
mod

this
announcement
play
the
same
part
as
the
three
knock
which
precede
the
raise
of
the
theatre
curtain
in
france
thanks
to
it
i
have
the
full
benefit
of

alone
on

stage
after
absorb
this
first
all
important
impression
i
ask
the
mannequin
to
come
nearer
to
walk
towards
me
so
that
i
can
examine
the
dress
in
motion
i
then
inspect
it
in
the
large
mirror
opposite
me
which
give
me
another
angle
on
it
the
mirror
show
up
its
fault
ruthlessly
mme
marguerite
who
have
already
repair
a
great
number
of
them
behind
the
scene
notice
them
at
the
same
time
as
me
and
instinctively
step
forward
to
correct
them
i
have
to
keep
wave
her
back
with
my
stick
force
her
to
sit
down
so
that
i
can
thoroughly
saturate
myself
in
the
feel
of
the
dress
in
absolute
tranquillity
the
premi
re
be
there
very
often
accompany
by
the
girl
who
have
sewn
the
dress
they
have
brought
what
be
left
of
the
material
with
them
include
the
odd
piece
left
over
from
the
cut
out
which
i
can
use
if
need
be
to
remake
the
sleeve
or
the
collar
or
a
pocket
but
before
passing
to
these
detail
i
order
the
mannequin
to
continue
show
the
dress
i
make
her
walk
forward
backwards
and
twirl
round
i
examine
the
back
the
side
the
fit
of
each
section
in
turn
finally
i
ask
myself
be
this
really
how
i

a

that
mean
its

should
i
make
it
shorter
no
after
all
it
need
lengthen
it
be
the
skirt

the
sleeve
which
need
their
length
alter
then
the
d

have
to
be
deepen
or
lift
finally
the
proportion
be
judged
perfect
the
balance
between
them
may
only
need
alter
by
one
fraction
of
an
inch

one
do
begin
to
have
an

look
in

it
from

might

myself
to
let
it
go
back

the

that
they
will
fail
me
during

the
conclusion
there
be
enough
showable
dress
ready
to
make
up
a
general
rehearsal
it
take
place
in
the
actual
salon
where
the
show
will
ultimately
be
held
and
have
a
tremendous
importance
in
my
eye
for
the
first
time
the
dress
follow
after
each
other
more
or
less
as
they
will
do
on
the
day
this
rehearsal
take
place
in
the
big
salon
which
will
later
be
crowd
by
the
public
against
the
luxury
of
this
new
set
most
of
them
now
come
into
their
own
but
a
few
of
them
founder
there
be
salon
optic
just
as
there
be
theatre
optic
the
dress
generally
need
simplification
and
amplification
to
suit
them
a
certain
detail
which
have
look
charm
in
the
studio
now
becomes
superfluous
a
certain
width
which
seem
to
be
sufficient
now
have
to
be
exaggerated
in
order
to
gain
its
true
effect
after
all
it
be
here
in
the
salon
that
the
model
have
to
make
an
impression
on
the
press
seduce
the
eye
of
the
client
and
make
its
kill
at
the
same
time
a
dress
which
be
conceive
entirely
in
order
to
shine
in
the
salon
miss
its
basic
point
which
be
to
be
worn
the
effect
of
the
ceremonial
entry
of
each
mannequin
which
i
have
already
described
in
the
studio
be
greatly
enforce
at
the
rehearsal
i
attach
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
the
shock
which
each
model
produce
when
it
first
appear
in
the
door
of
the
salon
if
my
satisfaction
be
complete
i
immediately
choose
a
hat
for
it
if
not
i
make
the
mannequin
parade
back
and
forward
once
or
twice
while
i
examine
the
dress
from
all
its
angle
it
often
take
several
minute
to
discover
exactly
where
the
fault
lie
in
most
case
it
be
a
case
of
an
error
in
the
proportion
and
an
excess
of
complication
i
do
not
let
the
dress
go
until
i
have
correct
it
fashion
be
above
all
a
question
of
line
from
the
shoe
to
the
hat
the
silhouette
must
be
view
as
a
whole
that
be
why
mme
bricart
and
i
now
pore
over
the
choice
of
the
hat
whose
shape
have
only
be
vaguely
suggest
in
the
sketch
the
particular
shape
and
size
which
will
suit
the
line
of
the
dress
have
to
be
decide
before
me
be
a
huge
heap
of
assort
shape
which
be
to
the
hat
what
the
toiles
be
to
the
dress
as
in
the
case
of
the
model
the
detail
will
come
later
at
first
all
that
be
necessary
be
that
the
hat
should
suit
both
the
mannequin
and
the
dress
for
which
it
be
to
be
the
complement
sometimes
the
problem
seem
insoluble
twenty
solution
be
try
without
success
sometimes
in
desperation
one
abandon
the
fruitless
search
among
the
exist
shape
in
order
to
create
a
hat
which
will
suit
the
dress
and
the
face
out
of
one
s
own
head
it
may
seem
odd
that
we
should
go
to
all
this
trouble
over
a
hat
when
woman
be
in
fact
wear
them
less
and
less
in
my
opinion
this
regrettable
departure
be
due
to
a
reaction
against
those
miserable
piece
of
headgear
in
straw
bedizen
with
plume
and
flower
with
which
woman
disguise
the
poverty
of
their
wardrobe
during
the
war
personally
i
consider
that
a
woman
without
a
hat
be
not
completely
dress
the
fact
that
very
young
girl
can
get
away
with
be
hatless
have
encourage
their
mother
to
imitate
them
but
they
be
simply
deprive
themselves
of
an
agreeable
addition
to
their
appearance
and
be
apparently
not
sufficiently
aware
that
the
cry
how
pretty
you
look
today
often
mean
no
more
than
how
well
your
hat
suit
you
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
to
show
a
collection
without
hat
however
ravish
their
dress
the
mannequin
would
still
have
a
dowdy
air
this
be
not
an
exaggeration
there
be
circumstance
where
one
can
afford
to
neglect
the
add
style
which
a
hat
give
to
the
face
but
on
no
account
when
one
be
present
a
new
line
when
proportion
be
all
important
the
first
rehearsal
necessarily
only
include
a
small
number
of
model
they
be
chosen
from
among
the
most
representative
of
the
toiles
or
those
which
have
to
be
sent
away
to
be
embroider
these
last
which
be
always
of
a
very
simple
cut
be
urgent
it
be
not
sufficiently
understood
that
embroidery
be
still
do
by
hand
as
in
the
eighteenth
century
sometimes
even
on
the
same
frame
and
take
a
month
or
three
week
a
ball
dress
may
be
entirely
cover
with
million
of
paillettes
or
pearl
each
one
have
to
be
put
on
separately
to
return
to
the
collection
i
watch
twenty
dress
go
by
of
as
varied
type
as
possible
then
i
go
to
sleep
with
a
more
or
less
peaceful
conscience
decide
to
wait
till
morning
before
make
a
definite
decision
it
be
astonish
how
the
passing
of
one
night
permit
one
to
isolate
that
which
one
do
not
really
like
from
that
which
one
adores
the
model
which
i
choose
the
next
morning
will
furnish
the
major
theme
of
the
come
collection
it
be
only
now
that
i
can
really
start
to
think
seriously
about
the
new
line
up
till
now
it
have
scarcely
seem
real
to
me
from
first
rehearsal
to
far
fitting
the
collection
now
follow
its
predestine
course
an
indisputably
pretty
dress
give
birth
to
three
or
four
version
which
be
directly
inspire
by
it
another
which
up
till
now
have
be
consider
as
classic
suddenly
seem
too
study
and
already
out
of
date
so
we
progress
with
good
day
and
bad
day
enthusiasm
and
revulsion
sometimes
even
disaster
in
the
midst
of
all
these
contradictory
emotion
come
the
moment
when
we
have
to
suppress
pitilessly
all
the
model
which
we
do
not
really
like
these
be
the
dress
which
do
not
tie
in
with
the
others
and
they
have
to
be
sacrifice
to
the
unity
of
the
collection
even
if
they
would
have
sell
extremely
well
it
be
significant
that
as
the
collection
take
shape
one
get
completely
attune
to
the
line
which
make
it
up
nothing
seem
new
to
us
any
longer
as
the
date
of
the
show
approach
one
only
know
that
the
dress
be
well
make
one
have
no
idea
whether
they
posse
any
creative
interest
we
have
to
be
wary
of
that
over
faithful
companion
whose
presence
make
everything
seem
out
of
date
habit
the
little
world
of
the
avenue
montaigne
be
thoroughly
worn
out
by
this
time
and
also
burning
with
enthusiasm
one
compliment
be
enough
to
dissipate
all
the
effect
of
overwork
a
reproach
provokes
cry
of
despair
the
premi
re
who
see
her
dress
thrown
in
the
wastepaper
basket
immediately
burst
into
tear
as
if
she
have
commit
a
crime
with
the
natural
and
touch
blindness
of
a
mother
she
look
on
the
model
as
her
child
and
refuse
to
admit
that
this
child
can
be
at
fault

through
a
new
inspiration

every

which
i
have
to
calm
down
i
nearly
kill
myself
repeat
over
and
over
again
that
if
the
model
go
wrong
it
be
after
all
my
fault
and
nobody

certainly

not

sometimes
they
refuse

desert
the
commercial
side

very
busy
at
this
time
to
come
and
breathe
the
air
of
the
collection
with
us
from
time
to
time
but
the
reason
we
be
all
incapable
of
retain
an
impression
of
the
whole
rehearsal
be
that
we
be
intent
on
examine
individually
the
detail
of
each
dress

be
positively
the
last
chance
i
have
to
alter
my
dress
tomorrow
they
will
be
present
to
the

if
all
go
well
slave
of
their
own
success
they
will
no
longer
belong
to
me
but
for
a
few
hour
longer
these
be
still
my
model
obsess
by
the
importance
of
this
final
examination
i
deliberately
ignore
everything
that
be
go
on
around
me
i
see
nothing
except
my
dress
for
obvious
reason
no
one
who
do
not
belong
to
the
organization
be
admit
to
the
dress
rehearsal
the
tense
atmosphere
of
these
last
terrible
two
day
remains
mercifully
unknown
to
the
public
but
i
have
on
one
occasion
subject
our
ritual
to
the
scrutiny
of
an
outsider
i
once
ask
one
of
my
friend
i
chose
someone
totally
ignorant
of
the
world
of
haute
couture
to
come
and
sit
in
the
shadow
of
the
mantelpiece
and
watch
us
at
our
work
two
month
later
when
the
work
on
my
collection
have
slacken
and
i
have
a
little
free
time
i
ask
him
to
describe
what
have
be
go
on
beneath
my
own
eye
here
be
the
tale
which
he
unfolded
to
me
when
i
first
reach
the
land
on
the
first
floor
i
lose
myself
in
white
muslin
successfully
evade
this
first
barrage
of
snow
i
have
to
overcome
a
second
through
which
i
be
firmly
but
courteously
rebuffed
by
a
disembody
hand
i
heard
the
murmur
of
the
word
cabine
dress
room
to
my
right
a
third
and
fourth
curtain
await
me
which
masked
the
entry
to
the
grand
salon
the
aim
of
my
expedition
i
felt
myself
lose
in
an
atmosphere
of
light
and
cleanliness
furthermore
there
be
complete
silence
around
me
but
a
silence
full
of
rustle
rather
like
the
silence
in
the
theatre
just
before
the
curtain
go
up
then
a
hand
lift
up
the
diaphanous
curtain
and
invite
me
to
penetrate
into
the
sanctuary
i
be
immediately
struck
by
a
tremendous
impression
of
whiteness
the
whiteness
reflect
off
the
two
row
of
armchair
instal
on
my
right
all
cover
in
snow
on
which
several
girl
in
white
overall
be
sit
quite
free
from
the
traditional
gold
and
the
crystal
of
chandelier
the
classical
grey
and
white
decoration
of
the
wall
with
their
large
mirror
make
me
feel
as
if
i
be
present
at
some
council
of
ghost
then
my
eye
be
dazzle
by
a
fantastic
cinderella
s
trousseau
strewn
on
the
carpet
on
my
right
accessory
whose
beauty
take
one
s
breath
away
luxury
and
frivolity
of
every
sort
be
there
jumbled
up
in
one
delicious
but
order
chaos
as
though
thrown
down
by
the
prodigal
hand
of
a
fairy
godmother
i
felt
myself
lead
by
a
benevolent
hand
and
place
in
a
chair
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
clearly
destine
for
me
i
sat
down
and
busy
myself
in
try
to
look
as
small
as
possible
the
salon
be
still
almost
empty
but
very
soon
other
people
come
and
instal
themselves
they
all
star
at
me
and
i
felt
them
wonder
who
on
earth
be
he
i
felt
myself
grow
small
and
small
in
the
secretive
atmosphere
finally
somebody
must
have
be
give
a
tentative
explanation
of
my
presence
because
there
be
shruggings
of
the
shoulder
and
doubtful
polite
or
interested
oh
and
ahs
these
interrogation
have
take
place
in
low
voice
heaven
know
why
they
all
spoke
so
softly
the
delicate
inspection
which
they
make
of
me
must
have
satisfied
them
probably
they
guess
from
my
behaviour
that
i
be
really
quite
inoffensive
to
my
great
relief
their
attention
be
direct
away
from
me
elsewhere
i
profit
from
the
respite
to
look
about
me
opposite

a
wardrobe
stuffed
with
fur
i
give
a
mental
shiver
at
the
thought
of

the

the
left

by
a
large
table
from
which
hung
a
profusion
of
belt
and
which

from

a
young
man
in
a
blue
jacket
with
gold

contemplate
the
scene
it
be
at
this
moment
that
the
curtain
billow
or
to
be
more
exact

then
she
revolve

and
smile
amidst
the
gentle
ripple
of
discreet
laughter
i
realize
that
this
be
a
traditional
joke
to
pas
the
time
of
wait
i
heard
remark
like
she
really
must
be
taught
to

you
see
ma
petite
this
last
be

a
real
gale
of
laughter
obviously
it
be
one
of
the
favourite
expression
of
the
absent
master

to

obviously
correspond
to
that
of

in

the
illusion
of

complete
by
the
entry
of
a
valet

about
ten

there

unexpected
inscription

my

outside

simply
the

of
the

from

the

commotion
disappear
as
rapidly
as
she
have
come
only
to

an
instant
later
equally
beautifully

little
blue

over

but
this
time
wear
an
open
necked
short
sleeved
white

she
sat
down
in
front
of

and
i
discover
with
astonishment
on
her

an

as
the

the

obviously
i
still

to

a

which

there
be
nothing
beneath
it
but
an
inventory
of
button
similar
to
those
of
postage
stamp
now
amidst
a
rustle
of
material
and
chair
there
be
another
sign
that
the
show
be
about
to
begin
le
patron
as
christian

be
always
call
within
the
precinct
of
avenue
montaigne
enter
a
murmur
of
relief
from
the
assemble
company
accompany
him
to
his

he
smile
shook
several
hand
kiss
several

take
up
his
baton
and
settle
himself
down
he
too
be
wear
a
white
overall
now
everything
seem
simple
there
be
exactly
the
right
number
of
chair
and
people
and
each
one
of
the
spectator
occupy
a
place
which
he
or
she
felt
be
his
by
right
just
as
mine
be
tucked
away
in
the
fireplace
at
last
a
tall
boy
in
an
overall
lift
the
white
veil
and
announce
un

as
if
in
response
another

declaim
the
word

and
a
mannequin
appear
she
advanced
walk
round
the
room
with
that
elegant
balance
movement
so
completely
different
from
a
soldier
s
march
past
and
come
to
a
standstill
as
this
be
the
opening
number
i
felt
that
it
would
probably
be
of
comparatively
minor
importance
in
the
nature
of
a
curtain
raiser
but
at
the
same
time
expressive
of
the
new
line
i
try
to
see
where
the
line
be
tend
christian
dior
say
softly
it
need
a
different
hat
something
altogether
more
important
now
what
exactly
i
wonder
now
that
my
attention
be
direct
towards
it
i
found
that
i
have
not
even
notice
before
that
there
be
a
hat
immobile
in
the
centre
of
the
salon
the
mannequin
gaze
into
space
at
a
point
which
exists
accord
to
the
expert
about
the
root
of
the
spectator

at
the
same
time
the
guardian
of
the
jewel
the
two
keeper
of
the
hat
and
a
fourth
assistant
sprang
to
life
the
first
fasten
on
an
earring
the
second
and
the
third
wreathe
round
her
head
a
mass
of
black
taffeta
on
a
foundation
of
canvas
and
a
vaporous
veil
under
the
impact
of
these
united
attack
the
mannequin
blink
finally
somebody
place
the
finish
piece
on
top
of
her
head
there
be
murmur
of
approval
salute
this
collective
effort
but
it
be
still
not
good
enough
from
his
seat
christian

observe
it

after

the

do
at
last
let
out
a
faint
murmur
when
a
piece

transform
the
whole

and

scene
i
found
the
woman
who
pass
in
their
summer
dress
paradoxically
summery
i
felt
a
sudden
mad
desire
to
buttonhole
them
and
say
no
that
revers
will
not
do
at
all
it
s
far
too
long
at
the

i
felt
a
certain
pride
i
be
the

of
a
secret
which
in
a
few
week
time
would
transform
the
most
elegant
of
the

cast
one
more
backward
glance
towards
the
window
of
the
house
behind
which
i
knew
that
the

would
go
on
for
several
hour
until
night
fell
and
the
first
star
come
out
until
in
fact
that
moment
of
inspiration
and
exhaustion
which
author
and
actor
both
experience
on
the
eve
of
the

the
three

which
separate
the

from
the
opening
show
i
draw
up
the
press
release
describe
the
season
s
trend
try
to
express
it
in
as
precise
and
unliterary
language
as
possible
in
order
to
think
of
the
title
and
the
emblem
which
will
crown
the
new
fashion
i
give
myself
over
to
last
minute
inspiration
in
fact
i
arrive
at
the
name
which
concretizes
the
tendency
of
the
day
by
think
in
term
of
the
most
marked
silhouette
of
the
collection
sacrifice
the
truth
and
my
hatred
of
extreme
to
the
modern
taste
for
a
slogan
in
spring
for
example
i
picked
on
the
fullness
in
the
skirt
of
certain
model
to
isolate
the
letter
a
which
succeed
the
letter
h
of
the
precede
season
the
letter
y
indicate
the
lengthen
of
the
skirt
the
slimming
of
the
figure
and
the
high
position
of
the
bust
between
the
two
branch
of
the
y
but
each
collection
consists
of
a
great
variety
of
theme
and
one
letter
a
h
or
y
cannot
represent
them
all
so
whatever
the
name
with
which
the
collection
be
christen
i
write
about
four
page
to
indicate
the
main
trend
of
the
season
i
try
to
write
as
soberly
as
possible
but
how
can
one
avoid
altogether
the
trap
into
which
the
language
of
fashion
be
apt
to
lead
one
i
be
afraid
i
always
end
up
by
fall
into
them
after
enumerate
the
principal
characteristic

the
workroom

in
a
positive
fever
of
last

they
be
now
on
the
eve
of
the
ordeal
for
which
they

for
four

the
moment
when
the

definitely
decide
to
suppress

a
way
of
reappear
from

to
time
they
come
before
me
interrupt
my
work
as
a
fashion
journalist
in

to
try
and
creep
back
into

the

them
on
their

whose
future
i
try
to
blight

an
unnatural

forward
and
have
a
glorious
career
severity
for
its
own
sake
be
quite
as
dangerous
as
excess
of
indulgence
wherever
i
go
at
this
time
i
see
only
dress
they
have
pass
before
my

too
many
time
occupy
my
thought
too
much
for
it
to
be
possible
for
me
to
judge
them
impartially
any
longer
the
whole
collection
seem
a
failure
to
me
and
although
seventy
model
have
be
register
i
have
the
sensation
of
have
do
nothing
or
to
be
more
exact
accomplish
nothing
it
be
in
fact
in
order
to

to
myself
the
contrary

for
myself

much
for
the
benefit
of
the

remain
marvellously
unpredictable

for
my
own
benefit
i
cannot
feel
myself
satisfied
if
i
have
make
no
concession
at
this
late
stage
i
still
eliminate
several
more
model
and
suppress
several
outfit
whose
sale
appeal
be
certain
but
whose
intrinsic
interest
be
not
so
sure
on
these

i
write
not
for
the

and
take
them
out
of
the

the

in
its
turn
burden
me
with
its
worry
the

of
a

have
this
in
common
with
the
opening
of
a
play
the
first
contact
with
the
opinion
of
the
specialist
have
an
exceptional
importance
i
believe
it
be
true
to
say
that
the
chronicler
of
fashion
generally
show
more
skill
than
the
theatre
critic
that
do
not
stop
the
couturier
from
brooding
over
his
collection
with
the
feeling
of
an
author
whose
piece
be
just
about
to
face
the
fire
squad
twice
a
year
i
have
to
endure
this
terrible
torment
some
people
find
it
add
piquancy
to
the
game
personally
i
hate
it
just
as
i
use
to
hate
examination
my
friend
in
order
to
comfort
me
keep
up
the
pretence
that
this
appal
hurdle
constitutes
the
best
defence
against
grow
old
i
pretend
to
believe
them
as
the
great
day
draw
near
the
nerve
centre
of
the
building
shift
from
the
studio
to
the
salon
the
publicity
department
becomes
the
heart
which
beat
out
unrest
into
the
general
bloodstream
m
de
mausabr
and
m
donati
descend
one
floor
to
cope
with
the
special
circumstance
of
the
opening
they
be
battling
with
homeric
problem
of
precedence
into
two
room
and
a
land
they
have
to
squash
three
hundred
people
when
allow
a
narrow
corridor
for
the

there
be
at
most

for
two
hundred

fifty
a
just
and
complicate
hierarchy
governs
the
rule
by
which
one

be

and
it
be
in
fact
our
dearest
and
most
intimate

who
find
themselves
relegate
to
the
doorway
corner
and
staircase
even
if
it
be
block
by
a
hat
or
a
shoulder
the
eye
of
friendship
be
the
eye
of
indulgence
at
least
so
we
hope
the
exact
place
of
each
seat
be
a
study
in
itself
there
be
the

any

mortally
offend
the

who
have
switch
over
from
one
paper
to
another

who
have
fall
out
with
each
other
from
one
season
to
the
next
the
paper
which
have
either
sprung
into

since
the
last
collection

else
grown
in
importance
to
each

must
be
allot
the
place
which
be
suitable
both
to
the
importance
of
the
paper
for
which
they
write
and
to
their
personal
prestige
even
so
the
plan
of
the
seat
in
the
salon
sometimes
have
to
be
modify
owe
to
unforeseen
circumstance
for

an
american
agency
once
add
this

mr

armchair

about
the

time
as
your

and
she
would
like
to
be
able
to
leave
the
salon
easily
without
disturb
anyone
else
in
case
of
an
emergency
although
some
of
the
guest
ask
for
place
on
the
staircase
because
they
be
subject
to
claustrophobia
on
the
whole
it
be
the

of

sought
after

to
understand
how
to

in
my

me
to
fix
the

up
it
will
perhaps
come
as
a
surprise
to
learn
that
i
concern
myself
personally
with
the
price
when
as
a
rule
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
administration
or
the
sale
side
of
the
business
but
the
price
of
a
dress
be
of
fundamental
importance
every
model
be
the
subject
of
a
detailed
dossier

the
hour
of
work
spent
on
it
the
cost
of
the
work
do
by

and
the

of
the
material
by
add
to
this
a
percentage
of
the
overhead
tax
and
the
necessary
amount
of
profit
one
get
a
very
good
idea
of
the
price
at
which
the
dress
ought
to
be
sell
but
these
price
although
fairly
calculate
be
not
necessarily
the
right
price
a
dress
which
be
apparently
insignificant
may
have
take
far
longer
to
make
than
another
which
be

more
strike
as
a

ought
to
be
sell
as
far
as
possible
at
a
price
which
corresponds
to
its
appearance
i
have
to
low
the
commercial
price
of
the
one
and
increase
that
of
the
other
very
often
it
be
those
little
wool

those
casual
dress
which
necessitate
the
great
sacrifice
one
can
hardly
demand
a
great
price
for
them
yet
the
make
of
them
particularly
when
they
be
pleat
be
one
of
the
most
laborious
task
we
have
to
face
yet
how
can
we
admit
to
our
client
that
a
casual
little
day
dress
need
as
much
care
and
attention
as

over
their

reassure
me
to
tell
the

quite
slowly

so
incapable

she
would
like
to
scratch
their
eye
out
but
in
most
case
the
mannequin
silently
and
speedily
change
her
dress
impatient
to
get
back
to
the

from

the
unforgivable
scandal
of
a
dip

hastily
twine
a

round
her
neck
intend
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
examiner
away
from

heart
miss
a
beat
when
she
see
the
skirt
dip
dangerously
below
the
coat
but
fortunately
she
seem
to
be
the
only
one
to
notice
lucky
walk
forward
turn
slip
off
her
jacket
to
her
finger
tip
and
let
it
hang
for
a
moment
suddenly
there
be
a
round
of
applause
sometimes
it
be
the
magic
of
a
particular
colour
or
neckline
which
have
arouse
it
in
any
case
it
have
make
the
public
blind
to
a
sin
which
be
after
all
only
venial
there
be
such
glamour
about
the
atmosphere
of
a
show
that
the
spectator
have
be
know
to
applaud
a
dress
of
which
only
one
half
have
be
embroider
and
which
all
unknown
to
them
have
have
to
be
hastily
redesign
to
cover
up
the
catastrophe
a
simple
black
dress
cannot
summon
up
the
same
power
of
suggestion
since
it
triumph
by
its
very
austerity
provide
everything
go
well
it
be
about
at

to
reassure
me
the
first
instant
it
be
possible
to
do
so
without
be
over
optimistic
i
begin
to
take
courage
only
to
lose
it
again
twenty
time
before
the
end
of
the
show
mme
raymonde
know
the
salon
by
heart
she
can
tell
the
different
kind
of
applause
that
of
the
journalist
from
that
of
the
friend
of
the
house
the
first
come
from
people
who
be
at
work
there
and
then
in
the
salon
before
let
themselves
go
with
enthusiasm
over
a
model
they
must
register
their
appreciation
in
their
notebook
the
second
type
of
applause
be
more
spontaneous
if
it
carry
less
weight
nevertheless
both
type
give
us
pleasure
with
her
eye
close
mme
raymonde
could
describe
the
exact
reception
of
each
dress
which
be
receive
with
enthusiasm
she
could
say
for
example
about
the
grosgrain
tailleur
with
the
full
skirt
that
the
big
salon
applaud
it
the
little
salon
take
up
the
applause
and
the
staircase
be
delirious
she
could
write
a
thesis
applause
in
relation
to
haute
couture
which
would
consider
the
subject
from
the
modest
clap
accord
a
morning
costume
to
the
tumultuous
cheer
at
the
end
of
the
show
not
forget
the
thunderous
clap
give
to

elaborate
ball

also
an
expert
in
interpret
the
buzz

know
that
it
be
make
up
of
exclamation
both
admire
and
denigratory
and
that
chatter
when
it
accompanies
the
appearance
of
a
mannequin
be
a
bad
sign
as
it
betokens
a
slacken
of
interest
on
the
other
hand
if
it
come
after
the
applause
of
the
expert
it
prolongs
and
confirms
their
enthusiasm
mme
raymonde

experienced
hand
be
also
see
in
the
cheer
which
she
literally
pluck
from
the
audience
at
the
end
of
the
show
in
my
honour
some
of
my

for
my
own
part
i
must
confess
that
i
appreciate
them
tremendously
towards
the
middle
of

for
the

where
compliment
argument
criticism
and
gossip

all

freely

meanwhile
the
waiter

the
staircase
bearing
the
champagne
with
which
we
all
now
drink
a
toast
to
the
new
fashion
for
me
the
terrible
moment
have
arrive
when
i
have
to
be
confront
with
the
voice
the
laughter
the
cheer
the
sigh
of
which
up
till
now
i
have
only
heard
the
echo
behind
my
grey
satin
curtain
i
abandon
my
vantage
point
and
relinquish
my
momentary
deafness
surrender
myself
up
to
the
warmth
and
affection
of
my
friend
i
call
it
a
terrible
moment
because
it
be
now
that
i
reach
the
climax
of
the
terror
which
i
have
be
experience
ever
since
the
begin
of
the
show
but
it
be
also
a
delicious
moment
because
i
finally
see
for
the
first
time
the
beloved
face
of
my
friend
whose
presence
up
till
now
i
have
only
suspect
while
the
champagne
circulates
i
shake
outstretched
hand
i
kiss
scent
cheek
i
receive
the
congratulation
of
my
staff
and
i
listen
to
the
delightfully
exaggerated
word
of
praise
which
be
be
apply
to
my
collection
divine
adorable
ravish
my
christian
name
be
on
every
lip
i
want
to
thank
every
single
person
in
the
room
and
tell
them
how
pleased
i
be
that
i
have
succeed
in
please
them
dizzy
with
the
noise
and
with
my
own
sense
of
happiness
i
scarcely
have
time
to
reply
to
the
journalist
who
asks
me
which
be
my
favourite
dress
they
be
all
my
favourite
i
answer
they
be
my
child
and
i
love
them
equally
as
one
love
one
s
child
the
fact
that
i
see
these
people
twice
a
year
and
always
under
such
move
circumstance
creates
bond
of
affection
between
us
which
be
closer
than
those
of
blood
i
have
no
idea
if
other
dress
house
have
the
same
orgy
of
kiss
after
the
show
be
over
but
be
by
nature
a
person
who
adores
demonstration
of
affection
and
tenderness
i
know
that
today
i
kiss
positively
everybody
on
the
cheek
my
own
cheek
be
cover
with
lipstick
a
sure
sign
of
the
success
of
my
collection
apart
from
the
fact
that
red
be
my
lucky
colour
change
and
relaxed
the
mannequin
now
make
their
way
into
the
salon
i
see
them
in
their
corner
sip
their
champagne
still
tremble
slightly
from
the
tension
of
the
show
smile
from
a
mixture
of
nerve
and
satisfaction
in
a
moment
i
shall
go
into
the
dress
room
with
them
and
toast
our
success
jointly
together
with
the
premi
re
as
my
own
nerve
relax
i
feel
exhaustion
creep
over
me
it
be
almost
delicious
to
feel
so
tire
i
reply
to
the
hail
of
question
which
be
be
flung
at
me
through
a
haze
one
thought
ob
me
oh
to
be
seat
and
taste
at
last
the
joy
of
have
complete
the
collection
i
want
to
shout
out
it
s
do
it
s
finish
it
s
over
at
last
at
the
same
time
i
realize
that
tomorrow
i
shall
feel
an
intolerable
void
my
life
in
fact
revolves
round
the
preparation
of
a
collection
with
its
torment
and
happiness
none
of
this
will
be
mine
in
the
respite
which
will
be
mine
from
tomorrow
i
shall
be
able
to
experience
none
of
this
i
know
that
in
spite
of
all
the
delight
of
a
holiday
it
will
seem
an
intolerable
gap
as
the
salon
gradually
empty
my
thought
stray
to
the
dress
which
so
recently
fill
them
who
know
what
tomorrow
hold
in
store
for
them
they
be
back
hang
in
their
cupboard
as
forgotten
as
the
empty
champagne
glass
it
be
now
that
i
should
like
to
sit
down
in
front
of
them
gaze
at
them
a
last
time
altogether
and
thank
them
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
xi
the
romance
of
clothes
it
be
only
once
the
collection
have
be
complete
and
show
that
its
life
really
start
in
earnest
those
whose
task
it
be
to
guide
a
dress
on
its
first
step
along
the
path
towards
commercial
success
will
think
of
me
as
a
very
unnatural
father
because
once
the
opening
of
the
collection
be
over
i
lose
interest
in
my
child
and
practically
never
see
them
again
for
they
have
now
cease
to
be
my
child
and
become
object
of
commercial
value
the
very
even
of
the
day
when
they
be
show
to
the
press
they
be
parade
in
front
of
the
professional
buyer
the
first
to
come
be
the
representative
of
the
big
american
store
escort
by
a
representative
of
their
paris
branch
they
be
as
interested
in
precedence
as
the
fashion
writer
be
they
have
also
paid
a
high
price
for
their
seat
or
to
be
more
precise
they
have
paid
a
large
deposit
as
a
safeguard
against
the
possibility
that
they
will
not
buy
anything
at
the
show
mme
luling
and
mme
minassian
have
to
pay
as
much
attention
to
the
hierarchical
seat
of
the
room
as
the
service
de
la
presse
do
in
the
morning
new
york
and
chicago
pair
off
san
francisco
be
enthrone
beneath
a
canopy
boston
face
the
window
and
share
a
whole
row
of
armchair
with
montreal
each
one
have
to
be
give
the
feel
that
she
and
she
alone
be
our
most
value
client
and
ala
once
again
five
people
must
be
squash
in
where
only
two
be
expect
the
little
salon
which
the
journalist
scorn
in
the
morning
now
becomes
the
most
prize
situation
because
few
people
can
get
in
there
and
it
be
therefore
less
strictly
supervise
to
please
our
customer
we
should
have
to
litter
the
room
with
screen
behind
which
they
would
be
able
to
watch
the
show
without
be
watch
the
relative
position
of
the
various
buyer
in
the
salon
depends
above
all
on
the
importance
of
their
respective
shop
and
these
fluctuate
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
activity
of
the
firm
mme
minassian
will
tell
you
with
a
smile
that
she
have
give
a
particular
client
a
less
good
seat
than
she
have
at
the
last
collection
i
be
punish
her
because
she
do
not
buy
so
much
at
the
spring
collection
the
first
visitor
arrive
at
about
three
they
all
know
each
other
and
we
all
know
them
with
the
year
we
have
become
a
kind
of
little
family
but
these
be
harden
professional
and
there
be
no
time
for
idle
chit
chat
everyone
keep
a
poker
face
their
emotion
well
under
control
nobody
want
to
give
away
the
fact
that
they
like
a
particular
model
on
the
contrary
they
do
their
best
not
to
betray
their
preference
to
their
vigilant
colleague
this
make
the
placement
all
important
and
mme
luling
have
give
herself
a
migraine
in
her
anxiety
not
to
annoy
anyone
or
favour
anyone
unduly
the
mannequin
who
be
receive
with
rapture
in
the
morning
now
find
themselves
greet
with
deliberate
indifference
a
perfect
illustration
of
the
rapid
change
of
atmosphere
which
make
up
a
model
s
life
no
longer
an
object
of
admiration
for
the
connoisseur
the
dress
have
become
a
possible
weapon
in
a
competitive
world
the
girl
still
elate
with
their
recent
glory
be
always
a
little
put
out
by
this
apparently
dense
reception
they
still
do
their
utmost
to
elicit
applause
although
the
only
model
which
stand
a
chance
of
receive
it
be
the
ball
dress
which
win
the
outward
mark
of
approval
deliberately
held
back
from
the
day
dress
just
because
they
be
rarely
order
by
the
big
store
although
i
cannot
hope
to
arouse
delirious
enthusiasm
from
this
assembly
of
hard
head

the
scatter
applause

direct
at
the
model
which
the
applauder
themselves

to
choose

do
look
out
for
a

quality
of

and
longer
it
be
the
more

be
sure
that
the

have
be
a
success
the
buyer

preoccupy
with
the
small
detail
of
the

the

honourable
buyer

would
react
violently
to
the
suggestion
that
they
should
copy
a

quite
naturally

memory
of
the
other

they

the

i
personally
believe
to

disconcert
the

at

because

with
the
treachery

there
be
numerous
notice
to
remind
the
staff
that
copying
be
steal
and
that
piracy
kill
our
livelihood
personally
i
be
glad
to
say
that
i
have
come
across
very
few
case
of
this
nature
and
they
all
occur
in
the
few
month
follow
the
opening
of
the
firm
the
second
method
of

place
at
a
much
later
stage
when
the
collection
be
show
to
the
press
in
most
case
what
take
place
be
really
a
regrettable
abuse
of
the
detail
of
the
collection
which
be
release
rather
than
proper
copying
all
the
french
journalist
have
to
sign
a
special
guarantee
in
front
of
the
chambre
syndicale
de
la

before
be
give
their
special
press
pas
which
admits
them
to
the
collection
they
understand
the
extent
of
their
right
but
some
of
their
foreign
colleague
less
sure
overstep
the
limit
of
good
faith
we
have
dot
about
the
salon
three
or
four
people
whose
sole
mission
be
to
discover
these
lapse
thus
involuntary
fraud
be
speedily
uncovered
the
miscreant
be
politely
ask
to
hand
over
the
sketch
which
they
have
make
to
us
the
law
of
haute
couture
be
implacable
write
all
you
like
but
don
t
draw
a
rarer
but
more
serious
occurrence
be
a
deliberate
attempt
at
copying
we
unmasked
one
such
scoundrel
take
microscopic
photograph
with
a
camera
scarcely
large
than
a
button
he
be
very
quickly
show
the
door
the
third
method
of
copying
and
probably
the
most
common
be
the
work
of
our
client
who
thus
show
little
regard
for
the
rule
of
the
profession
they
sketch
secretly
some
of
the
model
which
have
be
show
to
them
pretend
that
they
be
try
to
memorize
the
general
look
of
a
dress
whose
name
they
do
not
catch
when
they
be
discover
we
either
make
them
buy
the
dispute
model
or
confiscate
their
sketch
and
keep
their
caution
money
into
the
same
class
fall
the
agreement
which
some
foreign
buyer
reach
with
each
other
they
each
agree
to
buy
one
particular
model
then
put
all
their
acquisition
together
so
that
they
have
a
miniature
collection
assemble
for
a
very
small
cost
per
head
this
be
more
of
a
dubious
extension
of
their
right
as
buyer
than
an
outright
fraud
this
be
how
the
secret
of
the
new
collection
at
first
only
know
to
the
creator
and
his
immediate
entourage
evaporates
from
show
to
show
if
the
new
line
be
diffuse
too
widely
too
quickly
the
collection
loses
much
of
its
novelty
and
therefore
also
its
commercial
value
this
be
the
point
of
view
of
many
of
our
client
who
deplore
the
mass
of
photograph
publish
in
the
newspaper
before
their
own
dress
have
be
deliver
this
influence
of
the
magazine
on
the
couturier
be
essentially
different
in
europe
and
america
in
the
u
s
a
the
press
be
treat
as
an
accomplice
in
the
world
of
fashion
whereas
in
france
it
be
either
ignore
or
fear
the
french
couturier
tends
to
blame
the
press
for
indiscretion
and
bring
down
the
value
of
the
model
in
my
opinion
he
be
wrong
to
do
so
because
the
picture
of
a
dress
in
a
magazine
can
inspire
a
woman
to
buy
it
and
whatever
the
skill
and
accuracy
of
a
draw
or
photograph
nothing
can
compare
with
the
model
itself
without
the
toile
one
be
condemn
to
wear
almost
the
real
thing
which
to
the
elegant

the

will
become
of
him
the
question
be
of
real
importance
for
the
future
of
couture
who
furnishes
the
editor
of
these
album
with
their
information
i
be
afraid
their
informant
be
trust
guest
whom
we
receive
during
the
first
day
of
the
collection
perhaps
even
at
the
opening
itself
since
the
sketch
appear
at
the
late
four
day
after
the
opening
by
compare
note
with
the
various
house
it
be
possible
to
find
out
whose
presence
tends
to
coincide
with
pirate
but
so
far
we
have
not
be
able
to
transform
these
suspicion
into
certainty
the
forger
must
be
exceptionally
gift
i
have
state
that
out
of
of
the
model
of
my
winter
collection
be
reproduce
exactly
although
the
copier
must
have
rely
chiefly
upon
memory
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
sketch
in
the
essential
of
a
new
line
unknown
to
their
neighbour
and
the
supervisor
post
in
the
salon
of
course
the
programme
with
which
all
the
guest
be
provide
jog
their
fail
memory
but
the
annoy
standard
of
accuracy
point
to
exceptional
power
of
observation
quite
apart
from
the
grave
financial
prejudice
cause
by
such
practice
it
be
disagreeable
to
think
that
you
have
open
your
door
and
perhaps
your
arm
twice
a
year
to
one
or
several
people
who
have
come
to
see
your
collection
with
the
avow
intention
of
rob
you
not
have
the
soul
of
a
sherlock
holmes
or
a
maigret
i
have
not
sought
to
penetrate
this
distasteful
mystery
any
far
in
fact
i
have
take
little
part
in
the
event
which
i
have
just
described
once
the
two
opening
show
be
over
i
do
not
linger
long
in
paris
at
the
end
of
an
uninterrupted
work
effort
last
six
week
i
have
only
one
idea
to
go
back
to
the
peace
of
my
house
at
montauroux
to
me
peace
and
quiet
be
a
necessity
of
life
if
i
be
in
one
sense
a
very
busy
man
in
another
sense
i
be
a
very
lazy
one
the
application
and
care
which
i
devote
to
my
work
be
root
in
my
desire
to
be
finish
with
it
as
soon
as
possible
fortunately
i
be
innately
conscientious
and
therefore
never
stop
until
i
be
altogether
satisfied
with
my
work
three
or
four
day
after
the
opening
of
the
season
i
be
off
it
be
not
until
i
be
actually
in
the
train
or
the
car
that
i
feel
really
free
but
the
moment
that
i
get
to
montauroux
i
feel
the
need
of
renew
contact
with
the
avenue
montaigne
every
even
the
telephone
give
me
news
of
what
have
happen
during
the
day
i
be
told
how
the
foreign
buyer
have
react
what
our
best
client
have
order
and
the
principal
cutting
from
the
press
be
read
out
to
me
in
addition
the
graph
of
the
sale
be
described
to
me
it
begin
to
take
shape
from
the
first
week
onwards
the
third
day
with
timidity
the
fifth
with
more
assurance
and
by
the
tenth
its
shape
be
clearly
visible
it
be
rare
that
this
initial
indication
be
not
confirm
in
the
week
that
follow
as
the
day
slip
by
these
telephone
call
which
at
first
i
await
so
passionately
begin
to
drop
off
finally
they
cease
altogether
henceforth
from
my
point
of
view
the
collection
be
definitely
finish
part
three
inside
a
couture
house
xii
the
mannequin
the
dress
room
or
cabine
of
the
mannequin
be
a
world
of
its
own
like
a
box
at
the
theatre
it
have
its
armchair
its
lamp
and
its
mirror
and
it
have
the
same
tawdry
quality
the
mannequin
or
jeunes
fille
be
obsess
by
one
idea
to
look
beautiful
of
course
they
be
all
beautiful
to
start
with
but
at
the
same
time
they
be
all
a
little
unsure
of
their
own
charm
once
they
have
finish
their
make
up
they
turn
to
mme
de
turckheim
who
rule
the
cabine
and
ask
her
anxiously
do
i
look
pretty
baronne
if
you
fail
to
reassure
them
they
be
thoroughly
cast
down
for
at
least
five
minute
the
time
it
take
them
to
correct
their
appearance
in
front
of
the
mirror
nowhere
else
would
you
find
such
a
pure
cult
of
beauty
the
actress
in
her
dress
room
be
think
of
her
part
as
much
as
of
her
face

the
other

entirely
on

beautiful
chronically
unpunctual
your
mannequin

into
the
cabine
exclaim
anxiously
i
m
not
late
be
i
but
if
she
be
unpunctual
she
can
also
move
very
fast
in
the
twinkle
of
an
eye
she
have
undressed
don
a
white
overall
and
sat
herself
down
in

of
her
dress

this
form
part
of
a
line
like
a
row
of
desk
in
a
schoolroom
the
cabine
often
reminds
me
of
a
class

its
pupil

to
take
a
degree
in

the

spends
from
three
to
eight
year
in
a
couture
house
battling
with
the
exhaust
existence
of
the

and
then
disappears
before
speak
of
the
girl
who
be
at
present
work
for
me
i
should
like
to
describe
three
of
my
former
star
mannequin
whose
life
have
since
developed
in
a
different
direction
for
some
of
my
jeunes
fille
i
have
a
peculiar
fondness
see
them
as
pygmalion
saw
galatea
they
alone
can
bring
my
clothes
to
life
in
create
them
even
i
have
have
these
girl
in
mind
it
be
not
until
they
put
on
the
model
that
i
see
the
dress
in
its
full
glory
it
be
true
that
i
be
demand
but
who
be
not
in
pursuit
of
the
realization
of
his
dream
among
the
many
mannequin
i
have
know
one
of
the
most
naturally
gift
be
tania
when
i
first
knew
her
she
be
show
at
lucien
lelong
and
be
only
sixteen
in
several
day
she
have
acquire
all
the
trick
of
the
profession
and
have
developed
an
entirely
personal
manner
of
show
clothes
from
her
very
first
rehearsal
tania

with
praline

at

the
quality
of
be
a
mannequin
turn
into
a
woman
rather
than
a
woman
turn
mannequin
you
have
probably
guess
that
she
be
a
slav
and
that
be
as
characteristic
of
her
as
the
fact
that
she
be
a
mannequin
her
charm
her
slightly
less
charm
temper
her
contradiction
her
extravagance
be
all
slav
but
they
have
not
stop
her
lead
the
sort
of
life
she
want
she
have
open
her
own
fashion
house
in
italy
and
true
to
her
temperament
have
already
live
through
a
thousand
disaster
and
a
thousand
triumph
tania
be
femininity
itself
with
her
rus
her
fib
her
little
scene
and
also
her
grace
her
sweetness
and
her
loyalty
the
great
mannequin
i
have
ever
have
be
france
she
realize
perfectly
my
ideal
first
of
all
by
her
figure
then
by
her
slimness
and
blonde
colour
she
look
particularly
wonderful
in
seductive
dress
and
when
i
take
my
collection
abroad

love
to
give
her
number
to
wear

sensationally
with
cry
of
how
beautiful

be
so
typically
french
parisian
french
that

all
her
apparent
guilelessness

of
life

married
to
a
wealthy
husband
beneath
the
easeful
voluptuous
sky
of
the
tropic
sylvie
i
take
on
when
she
be
still
scarcely
more
than
a
child
and
throughout
the
whole
of
her
career
as
a
mannequin
she
remain
the
incarnation
of
the
jeune
fille
she
wore
the
simple
unadorned
gay
little
model
which
young
girl
love
her
sparkle
brunette
appearance
and
her
tiny
waist

to
perfection
on
the
day
of
her
marriage
however
she
abandon

forever
as
if
married
happiness
would
henceforth
prevent
her
from
enact
the
role
of
a
young
girl
what
more
charm
example
could
there
be
of
love
of
her
profession
and
respect
for
her
role

them
a
rest
from
the
splendour
and
luxury
with
which
they
have
to
face
the
light
the
idea
of
the
model
cinderella
who
borrows
one
of
the
dress
from
the
collection
to
go
ephemeral
and
clandestine
to
dance
at
a
ball
be
another
fiction
in
exceptional
circumstance
the
mannequin
can
borrow
one
of
the
dress
they
have
worn
but
they
be
never
lent
the
dress
of
the
current
season
one
by
one
i
have
destroyed
the
myth
which
surround
the
profession
of
mannequin
be
all
romance
then
flee
from
the
profession
on
the
contrary
i
believe
that
each
age
have
its
own
special
brand
of
romance
different
but
equally
entrance
the
girl
whom
the
journalist
have
christen
the
ambassadress
of
elegance
certainly
do
not
yield
to
their
predecessor
in
glamour
it
be
often
put
to
me
that
my
cabine
of
mannequin
be
run
on
rather
different
line
from
that
of
other
house
it
be
probably
true
as
i
be
convince
that
the
good
mannequin
be
born
not
make
i
always
interview
every
young
girl
who
want
to
get
a
job
wherever
she
come
from
it
be
true
that
there
be
specialized
school
where
girl
can
learn
to
walk
hold
themselves
and
act
unselfconsciously
but
the
art
of
be
a
mannequin
it
be
the
same
in
every
artistic
m
tier
can
be
subject
to
no
fix
rule
one
can
generalize
to
the
extent
of
say
that
a
mannequin
ought
to
be
tall
and
thin
but
such
impersonal
standard
have
little
value
a
mannequin
have
to
be
that
be
to
say
have
a
separate
existence
as
a
mannequin
in
addition
her
personality
must
correspond
to
the
imagination
of
the
couturier
so
that
she
fit
into
the
pattern
of
his
creation
naturally
every
cabine
employ
a
variety
of
different
type
of
girl
because
their
client
will
be
of
many
different
feminine
type
but
in
spite
of
these
difference
the
girl
have
to
share
a
common
style
a
sort
of
family
likeness
characteristic
of
the
house
in
which
they
work
in
order
to
become
a
mannequin
one
have
first
of
all
to
be
able
to
walk
which
be
not
easy
many
actress
and
even
dancer
have
come
to
see
me
and
to
their
great
astonishment
have
be
reject
a
natural
and
elegant
appearance
and
good
deportment
all
add
up
to
that
word
which
have
rather
go
out
of
fashion
bearing
like
successful
dress
born
mannequin
be
elegant
without
effort
on
them

spring
to
life
and
create
their
maximum
effect
above
all
this
effect
be
not
achieve
by
artificial
air
and
grace
nor
a
sort
of
brazen
smartness
design
to
attract
attention
the
contemporary
elegance
be
at
once
simple
and
natural
of
all
my
mannequin
ren
e
be
probably
the
one
who
come
near
to
my
ideal
every
dress
she
put
on
seem
to
be
a
success
as
though
there
exist
an
exact
equivalence
between
her
proportion
and
those
of
my
imagination
she
brings
fabric
to
life
so
exquisitely
that
her
face
be
lose
as
she
show
her
clothes
distant
aloof
it
seem
as
if
her
very
life
centre
round
the
fold
of
the
material
hieratic
and
always
a
little
mysterious
a
mannequin
must
always
succeed
in
grip
her
audience
the
theatrical
expression
to
have
presence
often
misuse
be
exactly
suitable
here
it
be
for
her
presence
that
i
engage
alla
she
come
one
day
with
a
friend
to
apply
for
a
job
as
a
stand
in
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
i
beg
mme
de
turckheim
to
take
her
on
there
be
a
sort
of
panache
about
show
clothes
destine
for
western
woman
on
such
a
deliberately
asiatic
beauty
but
alla
for
all
the
mysterious
allure
of
the
east
in
her
feature
be
in
fact
half
russian
her
body
be
completely
european
and
the
woman
who
chooses
one
of
the
dress
she
have
model
will
never
find
herself
delude
alla
be
one
of
the
born
mannequin
i
have
described
she
be
engage
on
one
day
and
ready
to
show
the
collection
on
the
next
she
show
clothes
with
that
aloof
and
impassive
air
which
we
associate
with
the
east
but
which
she
manages
to
combine
with
the
natural
fire
and
spontaneity
of
her
slav
blood
alla
also
speaks
every
language
without
an
accent
as
if
she
have
be
brought
up
in
many
different
corner
of
the
world
i
have
never
heard
such
a
storm
of
criticism
direct
at
a
mannequin
as
that
which
greet
the
arrival
of
victoire
she
come
into
my
office
practically
on
the
eve
of
the
collection
none
of
my
staff
thought
she
have
the
least
chance
of
be
engage
they
thought
she
be
too
small
and
above
all
that
she
do
not
know
how
to
walk
it
be
quite
true
but
in
spite
of
her
dissimilarity
to
the
other
girl
i
decide
to
engage
her
she
have
a
sort
of
look
of
student
paris
which
i
like
i
promise
to
make
one
or
two
dress
for
her
and
then
as
fitting
wore
on
i
realize
that
she
be
become
one
of
my
star
mannequin
but
i
have
jumped
too
far
ahead
of
the
taste
of
my
public
at
the
sight
of
this
newcomer
the
press
and
my
client
combine
to
raise
a
chorus
of
protest
how
dare
you
show
a
mannequin
look
like
that
what
clothes
and
what
awful
style
she
isn
t
even
good
look
some
of
my
critic
even
go
so
far
as
to
pretend
that
her
presence
in
the
show
constitute
an
insult
to
my
client
le
in
fact
i
be
fire
at
from
all
side
but
as
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
victoire
be
delightful
and
have
a
feel
for
her
work
i
stuck
to
my
gun
when
all
the
world
be
beg
me
to
get
rid
of
her
i
decide
to
let
her
show
a
second
collection
suddenly
she
be
all
the
rage
eye
be
suddenly
open
to
her
attraction
her
only
crime
have
be
that
she
epitomize
exactly
the
youth
of
the
time
and
she
be
not
very
tall
people
pretend
that
i
have
mysteriously
transform
her
but
in
fact
it
be
they
who
have
change
not
she
all
at
once
the
angular
charm
of
victoire
be
apparent
to
them
henceforth
she
could
do
no
wrong
victoire
become
a
star
and
justified
the
triumphant
christian
name
which
i
have
give
her
lucky
equally
celebrate
be
such
a
good
mannequin
that
she
do
not
choose
her
profession
because
she
be
pretty
but
make
herself
pretty
in
order
to
fit
herself
for
her
profession
she
come
from
brittany
and
have
the
high
cheekbone
and
slant
eye
which
her
compatriot
by
some
curious
twist
of
fate
seem
to
have
inherit
from
mongolia
every
entrance
be
for
her
a
matter
of
intense
concentration
study
and
interpret
the
slightest
nuance
of
a
dress
she
do
not
merely
wear
it
she
positively
act
it
i
wish
i
could
describe
all
the
mannequin
under
my
roof
together
with
the
premi
re
they
be
my
most
important
assistant
their
role
may
seem
a
passive
one
until
you
remember
that
the
most
beautiful
dress
in
the
world
can
fail
utterly
and
irredeemably
if
it
be
worn
by
a
bad
mannequin
this
profession
which
be
once
rather
descry
have
now
become
so
popular
that
parent
encourage
their
daughter
to
go
in
for
it
like
the
theatre
they
even
come
to
me
themselves
and
beg
me
to
engage
their
daughter
for
every
ravish
girl
whom
i
interview
i
have
to
see
twenty
who
be
obviously
ill
suit
to
such
a
career
all
parent
seem
to
be
blind
when
it
be
a
question
of
judging
the
beauty
of
their
offspring
the
month
which
precedes
each
of
the
two
yearly
collection
be
an
endurance
test
for
the
girl
from
ten
in
the
morning
until
eight
at
night
or
sometimes
as
late
as
midnight
they
be
on
their
foot
they
scarcely
have
time
to
go
to
the
canteen
to
snatch
a
hasty
lunch
i
be
always
amaze
by
the
stamen
which
these
frail
girl
show
nothing
seem
to
break
down
their
endurance
as
ren
e
once
say
the
only
thing
which
would
stop
us
would
be
if
we
actually
faint
away
but
i
don
t
believe
that
will
ever
happen
to
me
stoically
they
endure
everything
and
must
surely
be
at
the
end
of
their
strength
by
the
eve
of
the
battle
the
premi
re
be
so
obsess
by
put
the
last
finish
touch
on
their
dress
that
they
completely
forget
that
they
be
work
on
a
human
be
not
a
dummy
i
often
have
to
bring
them
back
to
reality
when
i
see
the
mannequin
reel
with
exhaustion
hurry
up
let
her
go
as
soon
as
possible
the
girl
shoot
me
a
grateful
glance
but
she
say
nothing
just
as
the
premi
re
be
absorbed
by
the
need
to
make
her
dress
perfect
the
mannequin
be
think
of
whether
she
will
be
beautiful
and
fresh
for
the
morrow
she
tremble
with
impatience
when
a
last
minute
hitch
with
a
trim
threatens
to
prolong
the
session
the
rest
room
which
be
near
the
studio
becomes
a
sort
of
dormitory
where
on
deckchairs
even
on
the
floor
the
mannequin
sleep
eat
smoke
or
gossip
as
they
await
the
final
fitting
but
the
next
morning
when

some
magic

only
a

have
gain
fresh
energy

his
precious

tends
to

that

them
and
the
professional
buyer
who

will
finally
wear

can
i
best
describe
our
client
i
have
say
earlier
that
it
be
my
ambition
to
be
class
as
a
good
craftsman
the
first
and
most
elementary
duty
of
the
couturier

of
all

men
be
to
give
the
customer
what
they
want
their
demand
be
limitless
and
we
ruin
ourselves
try
to
satisfy
them
but
we
must
not
forget
that
they
have
every
right
to
make
them
even
to
overstep
the
limit
of
our
forbearance
with
that
in
mind
let
us
watch
the
client
arrive
with
their

later
and

her

in
the
calmer
atmosphere

who
have
come
to
see
the

without
any
intention
of
buying
but
nevertheless

it
necessary
to
say
to
her
as
they
proceed
down
the
staircase
your
dress
be
really
delightful
she
can
also

obvious
that
only
his

be
any
good
this

the

of
a
collection
have
become
a
social
event
at
which
it
be
smart
to
be
present
it
be
a
good
excuse
for
friend
who
have
secret
to
confide
in
one
another
to
meet
it
be
also
somewhat
misunderstood
to
judge
by
the
telephone
call
which
the
publicity
department
receives
in
which
they
be
ask
to
reserve
a
table
for
the

this
even
but
i
be
determine
to
offer
my
show
freely
to
those
who
come
simply
to
feast
their
eye
and
i
have
give
instruction
to
my
vendeuses
never
to
harass
those
visitor
whom
we
nickname
swallow
who
have
obviously
come
with
no
intention
of
order
when
i
open
my
house
i
told
m
boussac
that
i
only
want
to

elegant

from
the
most

rule
not
to
enter
my
salon
and
never
to
intervene
directly
in
the
run
of
the

to
buy
or
not
as
they
please
without
a
feel
of
embarrassment
in
the

way

be
always
best
to
leave
a
client
at

to
make
her
own
decision
when
she
be
obviously
contemplate

later

in
the

be
completely
ignorant
of
what
have
happen
let
me
end
by
tell
my
favourite
story
about
the
disloyalty
of
a
customer
she
be
unfaithful
in
her
private
life
as
well
as
in
her
dress
for
she
have
two
lover
one
of
whom
dress
her
at
fath
and
the
other
with
me
the
two
lover
and
the
two
couturier
be
equally
ignorant
of
each
other
s
existence
one
day
this
delightful
edifice
of
deceit
topple
to
the
ground
the
woman
enter
the
avenue
montaigne
in
a
suit
by
fath
and
on
the
arm
of
a
different
gentleman
from
the
one
who
ordinarily
accompany
her
it
be
only
at
the
begin
of
the
fitting
when
the
woman
be
in
the
midst
of
take
off
her
skirt
that
she
realize
her
mistake
she
hastily
whip
out
her
diary
and
checked
the
date
the
time
the
name
and
the
dress
then
she
burst
out
without
think
mon
dieu
what
a
fool
i
be
i
thought
it
be
friday
i
shall
make
no
other
revelation
about
my
client
cruel
or
kind
for
two
reason
first
of
all
i
detest
spiteful
gossip
secondly
i
should
have
to
choose
among
my
client
the
dearest
and
also
to
satisfy
certain
people
the
best
know
the
very
idea
of
such
a
selection
be
distasteful
to
me
furthermore
like
a
doctor
the
couturier
be
bound
by
professional
secrecy
as
the
vendeuses
say
to
their
client
we
see
you
all
naked
so
let
us
drop
back
the
grey
curtain
of
the
fitting
room
and
leave
our
client
to
choose
their
clothes
in
peace
xiv
domestic
expansion
it
be
in
that
i
move
into
avenue
montaigne
this
delightful
house
then
have
enough
elegant
room
and
salon
sufficient
nook
and
cranny
to
contain
all
eighty
five
of
us
none
of
us
could
possibly
have
envisage
that
the
increase
need
for
expansion
would
make
us
first
of
all
absorb
the
stable
which
i
have
described
earlier
then
the
building
which
be
built
above
them
then
no
rue
fran
ois
er
then
little
by
little
avenue
montaigne
at
the
begin
not
only
do
i
feel
perfectly
content
within
the
simple
confines
of
no
avenue
montaigne
but
i
also
fear
that
it
might
almost
prove
to
be
too
big
at
the
same
time
what
with
three
workroom
the
six
fitting
room
and
the
various
department
of
the
administration
it
must
be
admit
that
we
be
already
a
little
cramped
in
order
to
keep
ourselves
within
its
bound
we
have
to
construct
in
the
entrance
a
little
room
four
metre
square
ventilate
by
a
grill
i
still
sometimes
wonder
how
mme
luling
manage
to
squash
into
it
her
two
helper
her
file
her
card
index
and
her
telephone
as
for
the
visitor
who
venture
in
where
on
earth
be
they
put
a
little
beehive
that
be
what
my
house

however

mass
of

boutique
which
have
somehow
already

i
consider
so
vital
to
my

be
nothing
i
detest
more
than
a
beautiful

of
the
feel
of

it
be
like
a
pretty
woman
who
lack

at
half
past
nine
in
the
morning
the
first
client
enter
and
bought
a

obviously
without

i
want

it
from

carry
a
present
for
her
husband
in
her
hand
the
expansion
which
take
place
beneath
my
eye
show
that
my
ambition
be
not
far
from
be
realize
all
the
activity
which
be
now
associate
with
my
name
be
to
be
found
within
the
wall
of
the
boutique
the
stocking
glove
and
perfume
whose
rise
to
fame
have
be
parallel
to
that
of
my
house
itself
the
public
have
little
idea
of
the
care
and
worry
which
go
into
the
search
for
a
new
perfume
which
they
see
simply
in
a
little
packet
it
be
such
an
absorb
occupation
that
today
i
feel
myself
as
much
a
parfumier
as
a
couturier
i
must
not
conclude
this
little
picture
of
my
subsidiary
activity
without
mention
the
salon
where
the
dior
delman
shoe
be
sell
under
the
direction
of
my
friend
roger
vivier
who
creates
the
most
elegant
shoe
in
the
world
while
the
boutique
be
undergo
these
adventure
i
be
collect
together
and
sort
out
in
my
own
mind
all
the
various
impression
which
i
gather
from
my
first
journey
to
the
u
s
a
like
all
frenchman
i
have
be
struck
by
the
amaze
stun
richness
of
the
united
state
wastage
there
seem
not
only
natural
but
be
actually
recommend
as
an
essential
factor
to
the
prosperity
of
the
country
my
upbringing
make
this
philosophy
a
tremendous
shock
to
me
but
later
the
terrific
creative
energy
of
the
american
encourage
me
towards
far
creative
enterprise
of
my
own
but
before
i
could
venture
out
into
this
new
field
i
have
to
get
to
know
the
situation
really
well
at
first
hand
at
the
end
of
the
second
world
war
the
united
state
be
not
the
luxury
deprive
country
which
france
and
england
blitz
and
bomb
damage
still
be
the
continent
of
feudal
millionaire
which
boni
de
castellane
discover
have
practise
democracy
even
in
its
elegance
create
thus
a
state
of
general
material
well
be
still
undreamt
of
in
soviet
russia
thanks
to
mass
production
america
have
brought
luxury
within
the
mean
if
not
of
everyone
at
least
of
the
majority
of
its
population
in
this
be
an
important
fact
which
i
have
to
take
into
account
i
have
also
have
to
take
into
account
the
almost
prohibitive
custom
duty
impose
by
america
which
although
she
preach
commercial
expansion
only
expect
herself
to
benefit
with
the
selfishness
of
a
child
who
only
play
to
win
this
one
side
notion
of
exchange
prevent
the
arrival
of
the
huge
dress
trade
which
have
make
the
fortune
of
parisian
couturier
between
the
two
war
essentially
a
philanthropic
nation
america
have
make
the
mistake
of
think
of
aid
to
other
country
in
term
of
charity
innately
distasteful
to
the
pride
of
ancient
country
like
my
own
rather
than
in
term
of
the
free
exercise
of
honourable
commerce
this
seem
to
me
a
short
sight
policy
although
perhaps
it
be
scarcely
tactful
for
a
frenchman
whose
own
parliamentary
government
be
the
most
strike
example
of
political
ineptitude
to
say
so
to
return
from
the
general
to
the
particular
instance
of
couture
i
realize
that
my
paris
house
would
have
to
remain
a
laboratory
and
its
dress
the
prototype
destine
for
a
luxury
client
le
and
the
professional
buyer
if
i
want
to
reach
the
numerous
elegant
american
for
whom
the
annual
journey
to
paris
be
at
present
a
semi
essential
pilgrimage
in
the
interest
of
chic
i
would
have
to
open
a
collateral
house
in
new
york
it
would
be
call
christian
dior
new
york
to
mark
the
difference
between
its
model
and
those
of
the
mother
house
in
paris
in
other
word
i
intend
to
risk
the
cross
of
the
ocean
and
start
up
a
new
venture
in
a
foreign
country
a
multitude
of
proposal
be
make
for
us
to
work
like
certain
of
my
colleague
within
the
framework
of
an
exist
organization
but
i
want
to
remain
independent
in
order
to
preserve
the
dignity
distinction
and
pre
eminence
of
parisian
couture
also
as
i
be
suppose
to
be
opening
an
american
house
it
seem
sport
to
run
the
same
risk
and
put
myself
on
an
equal
footing
as
an
authentic
american
business
i
have
to
make
two
or
three
journey
to
new
york
to
launch
my
new
project
a
building
and
staff
have
to
be
found
in
short
a
house
have
to
be
establish
with
all
that
implies
in
the
way
of
negotiation
and
hard
work
fortunately
mme
engel
who
have
since
become
the
manager
of
christian
dior
new
york
appear
at
that
precise
moment
and
played
the
role
of
guardian
angel
half
russian
and
half
swedish
by
birth
she
combine
the
charm
of
the
slav
with
the
strength
of
character
of
the
scandinavian
she
have
be
settle
in
america
for
a
long
time
and
know
it
extremely
well
but
she
also
understood
immediately
my
own
problem
as
a
frenchman
in
short
she
form
the
ideal
meeting
point
between
the
idea
of
two
continent
her
loyalty
and
warmth
make
up
entirely
for
the
strong
mindedness
and
impulsiveness
common
to
american
woman
which
i
might
otherwise
have
found
excessive
she
be
a
wonderful
guide
for
me
in
my
research
into
the
american
way
of
life
after
many
doubt
and
delay
i
end
by
rent
a
place
of
truly
american
proportion
at
the
corner
of
fifth
avenue
and
th
street
right
in
the
middle
of
the
city
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
work
on
seventh
avenue
where
most
of
the
big
house
be
as
i
thought
the
ready
make
atmosphere
would
be
demoralize
but
the
most
difficult
problem
still
remain
to
be
solve
that
of
choose
the
staff
and
most
important
the
chef
de
production
he
be
the
keystone
of
the
couturier
s
arch
it
be
essential
that
i
should
make
a
good
choice
more
especially
because
despite
my
numerous
inquiry
i
be
practically
ignorant
of
the
american
market
once
this
rare
bird
have
be
found
i
be
able
to
choose
the
manager
of
my
salon
and
a
vendeuse
as
for
the
mannequin
they
be
relatively
easy
to
find
among
the
ravish
new
york
model
girl
who
have
manage
to
protect
their
natural
elegance
from
the
effect
of
over
sophistication
i
would
not
have
dreamt
of
import
french
girl
who
would
not
have
at
all
the
desire
style
and
whose
proportion
would
have
be
all
wrong
for
the
american
market
all
our
preliminary
step
take
place
in
an
encourage
atmosphere
of
hope
and
ease
america
be
the
land
where
every
new
enterprise
every
original
idea
encounter
the
warm
welcome
and
arouses
the
most
lively
interest
nowhere
else
can
the
gap
between
the
project
and
its
realization
be
bridge
so
straightforwardly
the
american
know
how
to
take
a
chance
they
offer
you
generously
the
whole
armoury
of
success
if
thing
do
not
turn
out
right
it
do
not
matter
all
that
much
there
be
always
another
race
to
be
run
and
there
be
absolutely
no
bitterness
towards
the
horse
that
have
fail
fair
play
reign
completely
in
business
these
be
fact
which
a
european
above
all
a
frenchman
use
to
distrust
parsimony
and
unproductive
talk
ought
to
acknowledge
with
gratitude
have
once
establish
the
house
on
a
sound
business
footing
i
turn
to
my
favourite
preoccupation
the
decoration
of
the
interior
even
though
he
be
not
a
professional
i
beg
my
friend
nicolas
de
gunzbourg
to
undertake
it
his
own
background
be
proof
enough
that
he
be
capable
of
create
the
precise
atmosphere
suggest
at
once
new
york
and
paris
which
i
want
he
be
kind
enough
to
agree
and
i
sail
for
france
entirely
happy
in
my
own
mind
about
the
future
of
my
new
enterprise
a
rough
date
be
fix
when
the
building
would
be
ready
to
receive
us
my
staff
and
i
to
prepare
the
first
collection
when
we
reach
new
york
nothing
be
ready
contrary
to
the
widely
held
notion
american
be
not
really
people
in
a
hurry
on
the
contrary
they
all
seem
on
their
honour
to
be
late
particularly
the
contractor
in
short
as
our
own
building
be
not
ready
for
us
to
work
in
we
have
to
fall
back
on
what
we
could
find
i
decide
to
install
myself
temporarily
in
the
little
house
on
nd
street
where
we
be
living
mme
marguerite
mme
bricart
mme
raymonde
and
i
i
turn
the
winter
garden
into
a
studio
the
two
draw
room
into
workroom
the
pantry
into
an
account
department
and
a
bedroom
into
a
dress
room
for
the
model
we
try
to
fit
ourselves
into
the
remain
room
as
best
we
could
we
be
certainly
camp
thank
heaven
the
owner
of
the
house
never
have
the
bright
idea
of
pay
us
a
visit
she
would
have
be
absolutely
horrify
literally
pile
on
top
of
one
another
we
ate
while
we
have
fitting
we
slept
beside
the
table
on
which
the
material
be
be
cut
out
at
every
step
we
stumble
over
the
roll
of
material
and
never
could
remember
when
we
go
to
the
pantry
whether
we
be
suppose
to
be
collect
napkin
or
a
piece
of
material
we
all
found
this
atmosphere
very
amuse
as
we
knew
it
be
only
temporary
not
so
the
four
lot
of
servant
who
come
and
go
during
the
two
and
a
half
month
of
our
occupation
none
of
them
last
longer
in
our
service
than
the
time
they
need
to
give
their
week
s
notice
the
first
to
go
be
an
impeccable
butler
an
expert
at
hand
round
cocktail
but
apparently
at
very
little
else
the
indescribable
untidiness
of
the
house
visibly
move
him
when
we
present
him
with
the
vacuum
cleaner
and
the
saucepan
and
told
him
to
get
on
with
it
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
horrify
he
left
for
bar
more
worthy
of
his
talent
at
the
mere
prospect
of
remain
alone
in
our
tender
care
the
colour
woman
we
have
engage
to
help
him
instantly
left
without
even
ask
for
her
wage
a
swedish
cook
replace
them
newly
freed
from
the
austerity
and
ration
of
france
we
be
all
eagerly
look
forward
to
the
scandinavian
speciality
which
we
fondly
imagine
he
be
go
to
prepare
for
us
but
apparently
he
be
use
to
a
grander
set
up
more
in
keep
with
his
viking
s
stature
he
merely
set
fire
to
our
doll
s
kitchen
which
do
he
flee
out
into
the
street
insult
those
who
rush
to
our
rescue
next
we
opt
for
two
old
irish
woman
they
at
least
would
know
how
to
appreciate
the
charm
of
our
charmingly
bohemian
m
nage
at
first
our
relation
be
idyllic
and
the
four
of
us
spent
whole
evening
extol
the
virtue
of
the
emerald
isle
ala
the
dream
do
not
last
the
two
old
girl
come
to
see
us
together
and
jointly
give
in
their
notice
their
modesty
be
affront
by
the
nakedness
of
the
poor
shy
model
girl
this
time
we
really
thought
we
be
lose
it
be
at
this
moment
that
heaven
chose
to
send
to
our
rescue
a
wonderful
frenchwoman
actually
a
lady
of
the
street
in
search
of
an
officially
respectable
profession
she
be
at
the
same
time
gay
reliable
and
a
wonderful
cook
and
immediately
set
out
to
worship
and
spoil
us
with
outrageously
blonde
hair
but
impeccable
overall
our
angel
knew
how
to
cook
how
to
sweep
and
pamper
us
so
much
that
we
be
at
last
free
to
look
after
our
business
care
all
this
time
the
workroom
be
a
source
of
ceaseless
anxiety
to
us
ignorant
of
our
method
our
american
recruit
found
it
impossible
to
understand
why
we
insist
on
have
five
or
six
rehearsal
of
a
finish
dress
in
the
conviction
that
the
successful
reproduction
of
a
good
draw
would
result
in
the
production
of
a
well
make
dress
they
put
our
meticulous
labour
down
to
stupidity
or
clumsiness
in
their
opinion
only
the
bad
of
amateur
could
possibly
work
with
such
care
our
care
over
perfection
seem
absolutely
inexcusable
to
them
while
i
be
battling
with
these
and
a
thousand
other
care
i
be
suddenly
land
with
an
unexpected
major
crisis
all
at
once
everything
seem
to
go
wrong
and
as
a
result
of
what
follow
i
suffer
for
year
under
the
impression
that
america
the
country
which
be
suppose
to
be
the
champion
of
liberty
be
in
fact
a
monstrous
tyranny
in
order
to
protect
our
client
against
deformation
and
harmful
copyist
we
have
in
paris
make
our
buyer
sign
a
contract
engage
not
to
reproduce
our
model
except
under
certain
condition
this
attempt
at
safeguard
artistic
production
and
a
high
standard
of
quality
be
obviously
not
agreeable
to
everyone
no
more
than
the
opening
of
our
new
york
branch
be
we
suddenly
found
it
to
be
a
piece
of
administrative
orange
skin
on
which
our
entire
new
york
arrangement
be
slip
up
i
have
a
horror
of
lawyer
and
legal
proceeding
so
i
be
appalled
one
morning
to
receive
a
summons
to
come
before
the
american
anti
trust
department
for
an
examination
i
whom
the
very
sight
of
a
uniform
fill
with
a
profound
sensation
of
guilt
have
to
pas
through
the
door
of
the
anti
trust
building
flank
by
two
lawyer
how
much
more
ominous
as
well
as
more
austere
than
our
own
palace
of
justice
i
have
to
undergo
a
cross
examination
of
more
than
two
hour
which
even
to
this
day
i
have
never
fully
understood
my
lose
air
my
obvious
vagueness
save
me
i
have
no
need
to
play
a
part
incapable
of
discover
from
me
the
slightest
financial
detail
of
my
affair
my
inquisitor
soon
saw
that
the
wicked
conspiracy
which
i
be
suppose
to
have
enter
into
in
fact
have
no
serious
basis
the
famous
contract
be
annul
but
this
episode
reinforce
my
conviction
in
which
all
the
serious
american
couturier
concur
that
the
pillage
of
artistic
creation
be
not
only
authorize
in
the
united
state
but
also
encourage
nothing
effective
can
be
undertaken
in
its
defence
finally
in
spite
of
all
obstacle
and
prick
the
collection
developed
in
the
little
house
on
nd
street
be
ready
while
the
decoration
of
the
building
on
fifth
avenue
be
nearly
finish
so
several
day
before
the
opening
of
the
season
we
be
able
to
transfer
workroom
and
staff
from
one
to
the
other
nicolas
de
gunzbourg
have
carry
out
my
idea
to
perfection
as
the
date
of
the
opening
drew
near
i
be
overcome
with
an
even
more
intense
attack
of
nerve
than
i
ordinarily
experienced
in
paris
i
be
deal
with
a
public
which
be
completely
new
to
me
i
have
to
remain
both
faithful
to
myself
and
to
adapt
myself
to
very
limited
measurement
to
different
type
of
material
and
to
a
much
shorter
show
i
be
anxious
to
know
if
i
have
succeed
on
the
appoint
day
the
atmosphere
in
the
salon
disconcert
me
everything
go
on
in
a
sort
of
calm
and
stolidity
most
unlike
the
fevered
atmosphere
at
avenue
montaigne
which
i
found

an
armchair

which
will
serve
as
a
protection
against
the
wave
of

will
enable

to

and
the

as

from

the
applause
which
greet
the
show
be
very
different
in
calibre
from
the
frenzy
we
be
use
to
in
paris
the
reserve
air
of
the
very
same
journalist
whom
i
have
see
watch
our
show
with
visible
excitement
in
france
worried
me
until
i
read
their
piece
in
the
newspaper
cover
me
with
praise
this
frigid
appearance
be
an
anglo
saxon
phenomenon
as
the
editor
of
a
new

once
explain
to
me
if
pleasure
varies
in
its
expression
from
one
continent
to
another

do
not
mean
that
it
be
any
the
less

sincere

cry
out
you
kiss
your

your
enthusiasm

with
the

exhilaration
only
with
us

be
silent
with
the
year
i
have
grown
use
to
contrast
so
that
today
now
that
my
house
have
successfully
establish
itself
in
new
york
i
feel
that
i
be
a
genuine
american
couturier
in
new

just
as
i
feel
i
be
a
french

have
learnt
how
to

of

the

there
be
a
great
demand
for
short
even
dress
and
rather
formal
restaurant
dress
but
of
course
the
real
masterpiece
of
american
design
be
the
cocktail

very
little
worn
on
the
whole

with
the
exception
of
those
who
dress
in
france
attach
less
importance
to
the
small
detail
of
fit
and
to
the
finish
of
a
dress
than
to
the
general
effect
of
the
whole
outfit
they
be
attract
by
variety
and
frequent
change
and
for
this
reason
their
street
be
therefore
much
gayer
than
those
in
europe
where
luxury
lie
behind

must
also

more
time

to
spend
several
month
in

to
perfect
myself
in

because
i
be
for
the
first
time
in
my
life

felt
myself
far
enough
from
my

to

independent

at
the

enough
to
them
to
summon
their

simply
because
in
that
year

be
more
beautiful
than
ever

the
truth

cherish
an
unforgettable

happiness
and
personal
liberty

i
experienced
on
this
first
visit
for
one
thing

love

in
a
fountain

we
be

take
place
on
the
friday
and
the
next
morning
my
staff
and
i
found
ourselves
involve
in
something
like
a
thriller
plot
through
the
good
office
of
madame
massigli
wife
of
the
french
ambassador
in
london
whose
help
and
encouragement
of
french
couture
i
can
never
sufficiently
praise
and
acknowledge
it
be
arrange
for
us
to
show
the
dress
privately
to
h
m
the
queen
now
the
queen
mother
princess
margaret
the
duchess
of
kent
and
her
sister
princess
olga
of
yugoslavia
these
lady
be
all
devour
with
curiosity
to
see
the
new
look
dress
of
which
they
have
heard
so
much
as
neither
the
police
nor
the
press
have
be
warn
we
all
have
to
act
with
the
great
possible
discretion
in
order
not
to
attract
attention
the
huge
ball
dress
with
their
voluminous
skirt
conceal
by
cover
be
smuggle
out
of
the
service
door
of
the
savoy
the
whole
operation
take
place
amidst
a
tell
tale
rustle
of
material
and
constant
hasty
sshs
finally
we
all
mannequin
staff
and
dress
arrive
at
the
exquisite
embassy
which
madame
massigli
have
do
so
much
to
make
beautiful
we
have
one
final
chaotic
rather
emotional
rehearsal
there
in
order
to
get
use
to
the
different
length
of
floor
the
mannequin
be
all
taught
how
to
reconcile
royal
protocol
with
the
other
strict
protocol
that
of
the
show
i
be
told
that
the
queen
would
graciously
exchange
a
few
word
with
me
once
the
show
be
over
and
i
may
add
that
whatever
the
french
may
say
they
be
all
fervent
royalist
at
heart
certainly
i
be
face
to
face
with
the
queen
i
be
instantly
struck
by
her
elegance
which
i
have
be
quite
unprepared
for
that
and
the
atmosphere
of
graciousness
which
she
radiates
the
mauve
dress
and
draped
hat
which
she
wore
would
have
be
quite
inconceivable
on
anyone
else
as
it
be
on
her
they
look
wonderful
and
i
felt
that
nothing
else
would
have
show
her
to
such
advantage
the
grace
which
radiate
from
her
and
her
smile
be
appreciate
by
all
of
us
present
beside
the
queen
be
princess
margaret
at
that
time
she
crystallize
the
whole
popular
frantic
interest
in
royalty
the
public
have
chosen
well
she
be
a
real
fairy
princess
delicate
graceful
exquisite
i
have
heard
that
she
be
also
extremely
intelligent
and
witty
but
her
poise
and
the
formality
of
the
occasion
prevent
me
from
find
out
for
myself
later
however
when
she
be
in
paris
she
honour
my
salon
with
a
visit
and
i
found
that
she
be
keenly
interested
in
fashion
and
also
unlike
many
woman
knew
exactly
the
sort
of
fashion
which
suit
her
fragile
height
and
titania
like
figure
to
return
to
this
little
ceremony
at
the
french
embassy
you
can
imagine
that
we
walk
on
air
back
to
the
savoy
that
very
same
afternoon
norman
hartnell

round
to
see
me
at
the
hotel

have
see
the
show

day
before
and
told
me
that
he
thought
my
collection
so
pretty
that
in
his
opinion
it
be
worthy
of
be
show
to
her
majesty
here
be
a
delicate
situation
how
to
tell
him
that
it
have
already
be
do
fortunately
thanks
to
his
extreme
good
manner
the
incident
pass
off
smoothly
without
any
embarrassment
it
be
with
a
very
light
heart
that
i
attend
a
cocktail
party
that
even
in
honour
of
french
fashion
give
by
the
most
important
english
couturier
the
top
ten
my
second
glow

of
england

equally
associate
with
princess
margaret

in
when

several
month
previously
to
arrange
the

and
we
have
admire
the
chic
of
her
tall

great
advantage
in
her
elegant
red

her
famous
horror
of

when
i
arrive
the
next
morning
my
first
thought
be
completely
unrelated
to
fashion
i
be
struck
dumb
with
admiration
at
the
magnificence
of
blenheim
itself
the
beauty
of
the
park
in
which
the
leaf
be
now
red
and
the
exquisite
lake

the
two
flag
of
france
and
england
flutter
together
in
the
afternoon
wind
over
the
palace
i
silently
ask
marlborough
s
pardon
for
have
set
up
the
triumphant
standard
of
french
fashion
in
such
a
place
at
any
moment
i
expect
his
indignant
ghost
to
join
the
line
of
mannequin
the
poor
girl
incidentally
have
never
felt
so
nervous
in
all
their
life
as
they
parade
through
fourteen
salon
all
hung
with
tapestry
celebrate
the
defeat
of
the
french
use
to
the
tiny
show
space
of
the
french
salon
they
found
it
difficult
to
adjust
themselves
to
show
to
two
thousand
people
through
what
seem
acre
of
room
they
also
have
to
remember
to
curtsy
to
the
princess
as
well
this
show
at
blenheim
which
be
of
course
one
of
the
rare
showing
of
my
model
which
i
have
actually
attend
remains
in
my
memory
for
several
reason
quite
apart
from
the
beauty
of
the
set
just
as
it
end
i
be
assail
by
a
charm
crowd
of
red
cross
nurse
dress
in
uniform
like
the
duchess
who
press
me
and
my
mannequin
for
autograph
i
be
then
make
an
honorary
member
of
the
english
red
cross
and
present
with
a
diploma
to
that
effect
by
princess
margaret
i
learnt
afterwards
that
for
the
girl
at
least
all
the
excitement
do
not
end
with
the
end
of
the
show
i
myself
worn
out
have
take
the
boat
train
back
to
paris
once
the
show
be
over
but
the
mannequin
remain
at
blenheim
for
a
dinner
and
dance
organize
by
the
duchess
and
finally
set
out
for
london
in
the
small
hour
of
the
morning
but
in
the
general
confusion
of
leave
blenheim
and
arrive
in
london
so
late
there
be
a
muddle
with

as

among
half
a
dozen
london
hotel
it
would
have
be
the
height
of
folly
to
drive
madly
in
a
taxi
round
the
sleep
city
to
try
and
straighten
the
confusion
out
lia
burst
into
a
storm
of
tear
and
mme

be
left

to

the
morale
of

o
clock
the

ready
to
show
at

me
to
realize
the
project
the
first

come
fully
up
to
my
expectation
and
i
be
greatly
move
by
the
excellent
press
reception
which
it
be
give
among
the
english
journalist
who
attend
it
i
should
like
to
mention
particularly
iris
ashley
who
know
how
to
write
intelligently
on
a
subject
on
which
so
much
nonsense
be
often
write
at
dior
we
always
notice
her
absence
or
her
presence
keenly
and
wait
eagerly
to
hear
her
impression
of
our
late
show
in
spite
of
the
found
of
my
own
english
house
i
have
one
more
tender
memory
of
bring
my
own
collection
to
london
when
in
april
lord
inverclyde
chairman
of
the
friend
of

found
in
glasgow
during
the

the
french
sailor
from
brest
evacuate
there
and
the
honorary

mr

decide
to
give
a
soir

actually
two

one
at
the
central
hotel

and
one
at

both
in
the
presence
of
a
brilliant
company
present
be
m
chauvel
the
new
ambassador
of
france
and
his
wife
the
lord
provost
and
his
wife
and
all
the
scottish
nobility
among
them
the
delightful
duchess
of
buccleuch
embarrass
by
such
a
wealth
of
celebrity
the
announcer
begin
to
announce
us
with
rather
a
rich
preamble
my
lord
provost
your
excellency
your
grace
my
lord
lady
and
gentleman
after
the
show
there
be
an
unexpected
contrast
which
delighted
my
french
eye
the
parade
of
the
girl
in
their
delicate
even
dress
be
succeed
by
scottish
reel
dance
by
magnificent
scottish
gentleman
in
their
kilt
it
look
wonderful
but
beneath
the
frenzied
stampings
of
the
dancer
the
floor
shook
and
bounce
and
we
be
all
nervous
that
it
would
collapse
notice
the
worried
expression
on
our
face
the
lord
provost
told
us
that
the
wooden
floor
be
specially
construct
to
shake
beneath
our
foot
in
order
to
give
the
reel
add
animation
i
linger
a
little
in
scotland
i
have
heard
so
much
about
its
beauty
that
i
have
fear
to
be
disappointed
on
the
contrary
i
be
even
more
struck
by
the
beauty
of
the
country
the
castle
and
the
moor
than
i
have
expect
part
four
the
adventure
of
my
life
xvii
my
early
year
i
have
described
the
house
of
christian
dior
and
now
i
must
bring
myself
however
reluctantly
to
describe
that
other
christian
dior
in
short
myself
self
portrayal
be
always
difficult
i
wonder
if
one
ever
really
know
oneself
probably
the
simplest
way
to
give
an
idea
of
my
own
character
be
to
take
you
with
me
into
various
different
house
where
i
have
live
from
childhood
onwards
possibly
i
be
merely
give
in
to
an
avow
taste
for
interior
decoration
and
architecture
my
first
vocation
but
i
be
sure
that
this
attempt
at
indirect
biography
will
be
more
reveal
than
a
straightforward
account
of
my
life
our
house
at
granville
like
all
anglo
norman
building
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
be
perfectly
hideous
all
the
same
i
look
back
on
it
with
tenderness
as
well
as
amazement
in
a
certain
sense
my
whole
way
of
life
be
influence
by
its
architecture
and
environment
my
parent
bought
it
as
a
young
married
couple
a
year
or
two
after
i
be
born
it
stood
on
top
of
a
cliff
which
be
later
completely
built
over
and
in
the
midst
of
a
fair
size
park
whose
young
tree
grow
up
as
i
do
against
the
wind
and
the
tide
this
be
no
figure
of
speech
since
the
park
hung
right
over
the
sea
which
could
be
see
through
the
railing
and
lay
expose
to
all
the
turbulence
of
the
weather
as
if
in
prophecy
of
the
trouble
of
my
own
life
to
my
child

eye
a
pinewood
fifty
yard
long
meant
a
virgin
forest
it
have
not
lose
this
meaning
for
me
for
today
i
should
be
overpower
by
its
high
branch
but
the
wall
which
encompass
the
garden
be
not
enough
any
more
than
the
precaution
encompass
my
childhood
be
enough
to
shield
us
from
storm
this
house

at

even
my
reading
and
apart
from
those
few
book
which
make
their
mark
on
my
whole
childhood
my
chief
delight
be
to
learn
by
heart
the
name
and
description
of
flower
in
the
colour
catalogue
of
the
firm
of
vilmorin
and
andrieu
from
the
bedside

have
as
a
child
i
remember
above
all
perrault
s
contes
with
the
gustave
dor
illustration
and
a
very
modern
story
with
picture
by
metivet
i
be
thrill
by
these
picture
as
i
be
to
be
thrill
later
by
the
decor
of
the
great
room
of
the
nautilus
in
twenty
thousand
league
under
the
sea
which
have
remain
for
me
the
pinnacle
of
luxury
and
beauty
my
early
year
be
those
of
a
very
good
very
well
brought
up
little
boy

over
by
vigilant
fr
uleins
and
seemingly
quite
incapable
of
mingle
in
the
hurly
burly
of
life
at
the
begin
of
this
book
i
described
my
reluctance
to
leave
my
home
for
an
instant
a
reluctance
which
do
not
stop
my
first
child
s
party
from
make
a
great
impression
on
me
i
could
be
amuse
for
hour
by
anything
that
be
sparkle
elaborate
flowery
or
frivolous
the
newfoundlanders
return
or
a
three
master
bring
back
guano
to
store
for
the
family
business
be
real
excitement
indeed
but
they
interested
me
far
less
as
for
the
few
visit
i
make
to
my
father
s
factory
they
have
left
appal
memory
i
be
sure
my
horror
of
machine
and
my
firm
resolve
never
to
work
in
an
office

anything
like

ask
how
do
you
get

i
would
answer
that
as
we
come
from
different
background
we
met
purely
by
chance

rather
in
obedience

say
we
have

it
might

suppose
so
from
the
fact
that
some
among
us
have
stamp
the

of
their
epoch
with
their
personality
to
tell
the
truth
however
we
never
dream
of
become
one
of
those
group
with
a
social
theory
like
the
pleiade
the
encyclopaedist
the
barbizon
school
or
the
bateau

we
be
just
a

of

soon
i

have
begin
under
the

of

henri

appear
from
his
very
first
work
as
the
reviver
of
the
spontaneous
sensual
and
anti
scholastic
style
soon
we
be
fast
friend
and
it
be
through
him
one
of
the
best
composer
of
his
generation
that
i
be
to
get
to
know
the
man
who
be
to
be
one
of
the
foremost
painter
of
the
time
this
be
a
fair
young
man
slender
and
smooth
cheeked
whose
enormous
blue
eye
have
already
realize
that
the
human
face
and
people
s
life
be
worthy
of
far
great
attention
and
honour
than
the
simplify
still
life
of
the
cubist
or
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
abstract
painter
his
name
be
christian
b
rard
his
drawing
taught
one
to
transform
daily
life
into
a
magic
world
of
passion
and
nostalgia
i
bought
as
many
of
his
sketch
as
i
could
and
cover
the
wall
of
my
room
with
his
inspire
painting
through
sauguet
again
i
come
to
know
pierre
gaxotte
who
take
almost
as
much
interest
in
music
and
dance
as
in
history
and
jean
ozenne
another
friend
then
in
couture
who
be
to
have
a
decisive
influence
on
my
as
yet
unforeseen
career
as
a
couturier
what
extraordinary
meeting
those
be
colour
by
montparnasse
and
anglomania
where
we
ardently
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
friendship
our
bowler
hat
be
the
equivalent
of
today
s
high
necked
jersey
but
we
be
inspire
with
the
same
burning
curiosity
as
the
youth
of
today
through
successive
postponement
i
have
escape
military
service
like
all
the
student
of
my
age
but
in
the
firework
of
the
exhibition
have
be
set
alight
and
i
have
to
join
up
naturally
my
family
s
stable
and
comfortable
position
have
make
me
a
profess
anarchist
as
well
as
a
pacifist
and
so
l
refuse
to
train
for
the
officer
squad
my
time
be
pass
as
a
sapper
of
the
second
class
in
the
fifth
genie
de
versailles
a
regiment
which
have
the
advantage
of
not
take
me
far
from
paris
my
new
and
austere
life
give
me
time
for
contemplation
and
i
meditate
on
the
profession
i
should
choose
once
i
be
free
i
settle
on
the
most
sensible
course
one
that
must
have
seem
the
deepest
folly
to
my
parent
and
become
the
director
of
an
art
gallery
after
i
have
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
their
objection
i
be
give
some
hundred
of
thousand
of
franc
with
the
express
condition
that
i
be
never
to
let
my

appear
in
the
title
of
the
firm
to
have
one

over
a

consider
by
my
parent
to
be
the
nadir
of
social
shame
i
go
into
partnership
with
a
friend
jacques
bonjean
to
open
a
little
gallery
at
the
end
of
a
rather
squalid
cul
de

off
the
rue

ambition
be
to
have
show
there

on
the
master

admire
most
picasso
braque
matisse

only
i
could

be
able
to
keep
that
stock
of
painting
which
would
now
be
of
incalculable
value
and
which
my
family
thought
be
worthless
it
be
at
an
exhibition
of
the
work
of

i
met

brought
him
dazzle
success
which
be
shatter
all
too
soon
by
his
untimely
death
we
quickly
become
intimate
friend

we
both

high
value
on
friendship

year

a
springtime
of
friendship
rich
in
blossom

with
no

often
go
to

a
call
on

a
not

as

have
frequent
argument
with
my
father
which
end
with
a
slam
of
the

the
formidable
expletive
dirty
bourgeois
which
left
the
author
of
my
day
in
dumbfound
consternation
the
american
slump
the
forerunner
of
the
imminent

crisis
pass
almost
unnoticed
in
paris
america
be
still
a
distant
country
in
those
day
i
heard
friend
talk
about
the
embarrassment
of
some
couturier
face
with
the
sudden
disappearance
of
their
new
world
client
le
but
i
be
as
yet
far
away
from
this
trade
and
as
for
the
stock
that
slump
no
one
doubt
that
they
would
soon
be
rise
again
at
the
end
of
the
holiday
come
a
portent
which
alarmed
me
more
than
the
bank

empty

my

i
adore
suddenly
fade
away
and
die
of
grief
look
back
on
it
now
i
see
that
it
be
fortunate
that
her
death
come
when
it
do
although
it
marked
me
for
life
my
mother
left
us
before
she
knew
of
the
perilous
future
unfold
before
us
for
at
the
begin
of
my

who
have
put
his

solution
for
the
problem
that
this

the
look
of
the
carriage
cross
the
square
and
the
face
and
clothes
of
the
crowd
swarm
round
our
band
of
twenty
student
who
suddenly
seem
millionaire
all
told
of
distress
it
be
unnecessary
i
think
to
narrate
in
detail
a
voyage
undertaken
and
described
by
so
many
with
well
qualification
than
mine
we
tour
round
on
severely
plan
itinerary
strictly
conduct
by
very
pleasant
lady
from
intourist
and
even
by
one
sham
american
woman
tourist
so
obviously
a
spy
that
we
be
soon
relieve
of
her
company
our
guardian
angel
found
it
very
difficult
to
keep
us
together
and
prevent
us
from
see
the
hideous
poverty
then
reign
everywhere
the
facade
of
the
palace
be
crumble
in
the
traffic
less
street
an
empty
face
crowd
patrol
before
shop
with
empty
window
foreigner
be
park
in
hotel
that
have
be
luxurious
before
but
now
nothing
in
them
work
food
fit
for
a
wartime
siege
do
little
to
appease
our
appetite
sharpen
by
walk
if
i
have
not
be
attack
by
bedbug
i
might
have
sample
the
monotonous
poetry
of
the
shore
of
the
volga
only
the
caucasus
the
fringe
of
the
black
sea
the
russian
riviera
seem
to
me
to
be
pleasant
and
habitable
thanks
to
the
climate
in
short
this
journey
to
the
u
s
s
r
in
abound
with
surprise
i
wonder
at
the
country
s
civilization
in
time
past
i
be
disappointed
by
the
horrible
present
and
admire
this
people
s
capacity
to
exist
at
such
a
low
level
of
life
without
lose
faith
in
its
future
and
its
mission
to
be
fair
one
must
allow
for
the
role
of
the
eternal
east
in
this
picture
of
poverty
and
disorder
yet
nothing
will
make
me
alter
my
impression
that
under
the
tsar
russia
knew
a
well
way
of
life
than
the
one
i
saw
it
may
be
i
hope
so
that
such
a
huge
sacrifice
will
not
have
be
accepted
and
borne
in
vain
but
i
must
say
we
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
when
our
passport
have
be
give
back
and
the
boat
sail
out
of
soviet
water
we
be
glad
to
be
go
back
to
the
west
even
though
it
be
in
the
midst
of
a
crisis
and
for
me
furthermore
the
return
be
cloud
with
deepest
sorrow
and
care
the
third
class
cabin
in
our
cargo
boat
serve
the
black
sea
port
seem
to
me
luxury
indeed
as
for
the
bazaar
of
trebizond
stuffed
with
worthless
trinket
i
thought
on
enter
them
i
be
go
into
ali
baba
s
magic
cave
our
route
surpass
itself
in
beauty
and
i
saw
for
the
first
time
constantinople
and
athens
as
the
end
of
the
voyage
drew
near
i
felt
i
should
have
to
face
new
trial
i
do
not
know
that
as
soon
as
i
have
land
in
france
i
should
have
to
prepare
for
another
journey
the
one
c
line
would
call
by
a
name
so
fitting
to
my
new
fate
journey
to
the
end
of
the
night
in
marseille
a
telegram
await
me
my
partner
told
me
that
he
be
ruin
in
his
turn
i
wonder
what
would
happen
and
what
i
should
do
my
family
have
go
back
to
normandy
since
they
could
no
longer
afford
their
flat
in
paris
i
be
alone
for
the
first
time
i
felt
i
understood
what
life
be
about
i
left
the
house
which
have
always
be
home
and
since
i
could
not
afford
hotel
sought
refuge
in
other
people
s
house
they
be
always
kind
and
welcome
i
hope
that
as
i
try
to
keep
as
quiet
and
self
efface
as
possible
i
be
not
too
much
of
a
burden
to
the
friend
who
give
me
their
hospitality
never
guess
that
i
would
come
back
at
night
supperless
i
be
busy
try
to
sell
the
picture
in
the
gallery
an
incredibly
difficult
task
in
those
panic
stricken
time
painting
which
today
would
be
worth
million
of
franc
hardly
fetch
a
few
ten
of
thousand
with
the
rare
exception
of
wealthy
patron
and
collector
like
the
vicomte
and
vicomtesse
de
noailles
and
david
weill
dealer
be
force
to
sell
the
picture
among
themselves
at
ever
decrease
price
the
day
one
do
not
suffer
a
stagger
loss
one
thought
one
have
make
a
good
deal
i
separate
from
jacques
bonjean
my
partner
only
to
share
in
the
even
bad
affair
of
pierre
colle
so
we
go
on
from
loss
to
good
seize
in
exchange
all
the
while
organize
surrealist
abstract

by
which
we
chase
away

last

have
to
start
come
to
the
help
of
my
family
whose
fund
be
grow
ever
less
and
the
situation
seem
hopeless
not
only
in
my
eye
but
in
those
of
a
whole
generation
today
i
consider
that
because
misfortune
be
share
among
several
friend
of
the
same
age
and
of
the
same
taste

less
unbearable
than
it
might
have

of

in
my

the

would
keep
away

raise
to
the
dignity
of

i
can
see
us
still
bongard
his

and
myself
dress
up
as
god
know
what
trot
from

door
to
carriage
door
to
arrive
on
foot
without
be
notice
at
some
masked
ball
but
we
be
dance
on
a
volcano
that
be
just
about
to
erupt
after
so
many
worry
and
so
many
miss
meal
the
inevitable
happen
i
fell
ill
seriously
ill
i
have
to
leave
for
a
mountain
climate
at
once
as
there
be
no
form
of
social
insurance
my
friend
clubbed
together
to
help
me
thanks
to
their
generosity
i
be
able
to
spend
a
year
first
at
font
romeu
and
then
in
the
balearic
island
where
the
cost
of
living
be
a
great
deal
low
than
in
france
it
be
during
this
retreat
from
paris
where
i
have
always
be
content
to
admire
the
artistic
achievement
of
others
that
i
discover
in
myself
the
desire
to
create
something
of
my
own
i
learnt
the
art
of
tapestry
make
and
become
tremendously
enthusiastic
about
it
i
then
drew
some
design
for
tapestry
and
later
consider
set
up
a
workshop
i
be
discourage
both
by
my
own
lack
of
mean
and
by
the
general
lack
of
interest
in
tapestry
on
the
part
of
the
public
nevertheless
i
look
back
on
this
attempt
to
give
vent
to
my
artistic
feeling
with
pride
on
my
return
to
paris
i
found
my
family
in
desperate
strait
have
sell
their
last
possession
of
any
value
i
persuade
them
to
sell
their
remain
share
and
go
and
live
in
the
south
of
france
i
then
look
round
for
a
regular
job
for
myself
it
be
not
without
reluctance
that
i
resign
myself
to
make
the
round
of
the
various
place
which
might
offer
employment
insurance
company
bank
accountant
it
be
scarcely
the
right
moment
to
be
seek
a
job
i
learnt
to
appreciate
all
the
minor
anxiety
of
the
unemployed
the
fear
that
i
would
not
get
to
the
newspaper
kiosk
in
time
to
scrutinize
the
small
ad
the
hasty
scan
in
order
to
memorize
the
hopeful
address
the
rush
to
try
and
arrive
ahead
of
the
queue
of
other
applicant
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
sterile
expedition
i
go
and
saw
lucien
lelong
in
order
to
apply
for
some
sort
of
office
job
i
shall
never
know
quite
what
prompt
me
but
i
suddenly
heard
myself
blurting
out
the
word
i
think
i
would
be
more
useful
work
on
the
actual
couture
side
of
the
business
that
remark
marked
the
end
of
my
downward
progress
i
be
lucky
enough
to
sell
to
the
c
p
d
e
a
large
dufy
which
i
still
have
a
plan
of
paris
poiret
have
commission
it
in
order
to
decorate
his
amour
d
lices
et
orgues
at
the
fabulous
time
of
the
art
d
coratifs
exhibition
of
several
year
later
he
be
ruin
and
sell
it
to
me
this
windfall
give
me
time
to
breathe
and
allow
me
to
interrupt
my
vain
pilgrimage
round
the
paris
office
i
could
also
help
my
family
jean
ozenne
suggest
that
i
should
come
and
live
with
him
in
his
charm
flat
on
the
quai
henri
quatre
which
have
a
most
beautiful
view
of
the
seine
the
square
end
of
the
le
saint
louis
and
the
distant
panth
on
there
be
nothing
to
indicate
that
jean
ozenne
would
have
an
extremely
successful
theatrical
career
after
he
be
then
a
fashion
designer
number
of
couturier
bought
design
from
him
see
that
he
be
at
work
and
see
that
i
be
totally
out
of
work
i
set
out
to
imitate
him
not
only
do
jean
encourage
me
and
allow
me
to
learn
from
his
experience
but
he
also
suggest
show
my
design
to
his
regular
client
at
the
same
time
as
his
own
an
american
friend
of
mine
call
max
kenna

taught
me
to
use
the
paintbrush

how
to
mix

colour

dare
i
start
to
submit

to
all
the
magazine

in
triumph
he
have
sell
some

of
mine
for
franc
at

it
be
the
first
money
i
have
ever

a
long
night
they
decide
my
future
then
and
they
be
to
illuminate
my
whole
life
for
the
future
it
be
in
this
fashion
that
i
discover
my
true
m
tier
at
the
age
of
thirty
i
go
down
to
the

to
look
after
my
family

affair
and
also
to
work
hard
at

seem
incredible

think
that
despite
my
love
of
art
and
my
many
artistic
friend
i
scarcely
knew

george
geffroy
do
not
spare
me
their
criticism

i
be
stung
to
far
effort
living
from
hand
to
mouth
on
the
proceeds
of
the
few
sketch
i
sell
one
by
one
at
the
price
of
interminable
wait
in
wait
room
and
office
i
labour
on
but
this
pilgrimage
towards
the
establishment
of
my
reputation
which
last
for
two
year
be
infinitely
less
painful
than
the
struggle
for
uncongenial
employment
which
have
precede
it
after
all
i
be
fight
on
a
much
more
attractive
battlefield

for
his

collection
at
last
i
be
able
to
see
one
of
my
design
put
into
practice
marked
the
end
of
my
year
of
apprenticeship
i
be
no
longer
a
humble
designer
who
hung
about
wait
room
but
a
designer
whose
name
be
know
and
who
make
proper
appointment
for
his
visit
most
important
of
all
i
be
do
well
enough
to
realize
the
chief
ambition
of
my
life
and
have
a
home
of
my
own
it
be
then
comparatively
easy
to
find
a
flat
it
be
while
i
be
sell
some
design
in
the
rue
royale
that
i
saw
the
notice
to
let
at
no
i
be
show
five
large
room
which
have
be
empty
for
more
than
a
year
and
be
told
that
i
could
have
the
floor
above
if
i
so
wish
i
settle
for
a
rent
of
franc
a
year
and
found
myself
instal
with
my
furniture
my
bed
my
picture
and
my
few
ornament
admittedly
the
room
be
still
very
bare
but
what
do
it
matter
i
have
my
home
in
piguet
move
to
the
rond
point
de
champ
lys

and
ask
me
to
go
and
work
for
him
as
a
house
designer
i
be
thrill
at
the
offer
and
instantly
accepted
at
last
i
would
get
to
know
the
mysterious
mean
by
which
an
idea
be
transform
into
a
dress
i
would
make
a
shy
but
fascinate
entrance
into
the
universe
of
premi
re
and
workroom
i
would
discover
the
secret
of
cut
and
stitch
piguet
be
a
charm
but
changeable
master
his
love
of
intrigue
which
alone
could
awaken
a
flicker
of
gaiety
in
his
cynical
eye
make
it
somewhat
difficult
to
work
for
him
but
he
appreciate
my
idea
and
the
model
i
design
for
him
be
genuinely
successful

even
more

burst
of
folly
which
always
seem
to
precede
a
catastrophe
paris

rarely

be
rudely
torn
from

i
spent
a
year
there
in
sabot
with
peasant
from

i
quickly
forgot

in
that
very
different
atmosphere
for
i
be
once
more
penniless
have
save
nothing
from
my
pre

earnings
i
found
myself
living
for
the
first
time
in
the
depth
of
the
country
i
become
passionately
fond
of
it
and
developed
a
feel
for
hard
labour
on
the
land
the
cycle
of
the
season
and
the
perpetually

mystery

me
thank
god
in
the
southern
zone
of

easy
enough
for
me
to
join
my
father

at
their
retreat
at
callian
a
little
village
in
the

experience
at
mehun
have
taught
me
that
i
have
a
strong
streak
of
the
peasant
so
with
my
sister
i
decide
to
cultivate
the
little
piece
of
land
which
surround
the
house

admirable
soil
for

vegetable
and
they
fetch
excellent
price
on
the
market
during
this
period
of
general
restriction
we
pull
up
flower
and
rosebush
and
concentrate
on
runner

to
take
up
my
old
job
in
his
house
i
hesitate
a
great
deal
i
disliked
intensely
the
idea
of
return
to
a
humiliate
and
beaten
paris
and
my
new
countrified
mentality
disliked
the
thought
of
the
intrigue
and
labour
of
studio
life
i
also
have
to
consider
the
future
of
our
agricultural
venture
if
it
be
left
under
the
sole
supervision
of
my
sister
in
short
it
be
not
until
the
end
of
that
i
decide
to
accept
robert
piguet
s
offer
when
i
eventually
arrive
back
in
paris
i
found
piguet
extremely
vexed
at
my
tardy
arrival
after
beating
about
the
bush
for
a
bit
he
confess
to
me
that
weary
of
wait
for
me
he
have
engage
in
my
place
a
young
designer
previously
at
chanel
call
antonio
de
castillo
the
fact
that
i
heard
his
name
for
the
first
time
in
such
unfavourable
circumstance
have
not
prevent
castillo
and
me
from
become
excellent
friend
in
any
case
this
temporary
setback
turn
to
my
advantage
for
paul
caldagues
touch
at
my
plight
introduce
me
to
lucien
lelong
who
engage
me
there
and
then
on
the
spot
the
house
of
lelong
be
an
excellent
couture
school
there
be
a
solid
tradition
of
good
workmanship
thanks
to
some
remarkable
premi
re
direct
by
nadine
cassandre
at
lelong
which
be
a
much
large
house
than
piguet
i
learnt
a
tremendous
amount
more
about
my
new
profession
the
creation
of
the
model
there
be
not
my
sole
responsibility
for
pierre
balmain
who
have
work
at
lucien
lelong
before
the
war
come
and
take
up
his
old
job
no
malicious
rivalry
ever
divide
us
during
the
year
we
work
together
love
of
fashion
take
pride
of
place
over
love
of
self
neither
balmain
nor
i
will
ever
forget
that
lelong
taught
us
our
profession
in
spite
of
all
the
restriction
of
wartime
and
the
constant
fear
of
a
sudden
closing
such
an
apparently
frivolous
and
futile
occupation
risk
earn
the
displeasure
of
the
german
but
somehow
we
manage
to
exist
until
the
day
of
liberation
lelong
be
actually
in
the
midst
of
prepare
his
winter
collection
when
we
be
liberate
several
week
later
to
the
amazement
of
the
ally
he
be
able
to
present
them
with
a
spectacle
of
living
parisian
fashion
i
sometimes
wonder
how
i
manage
to
carry
on
at
all
during
those
year
for
my
sister
she
with
whom
i
have
share
the
care
and
joy
of
the
garden
at
callian
have
be
arrest
and
then
deport
in
june
i
exhaust
myself
in
vain
in
try
to
trace
her
work
exigent
all
absorb
work
be
the
only
drug
which
enable
me
to
forget
her
fashion
in
those
day
be
well
i
have
already
say
enough
about
those
hideous
style
and
monstrous
hat
at
the
begin
of
this
book
in
the
ten
year
since
the
war
end
i
have
have
great
pleasure
in
take
my
revenge
on
those
hideous
style
xix
portrait
of
myself
we
all
have
our
own
little
faiblesse
which
be
at
the
same
time
a
source
of
strength
because
the
thought
of
it
while
away
the
weary
hour
and
give
motive
force
to
our
toil
what
be
my
particular
weakness
i
shall
first
of
all
reject
those
weakness
which
i
do
not
share
unless
there
be
something
outstanding
to
be
see
i
take
little
pleasure
in
entertainment
like
cinema
cabaret
or
nightclub
i
be
sometimes
ask
why
i
so
seldom
design
for
the
theatre
why
my
name
so
rarely
appear
on
programme
in
my
opinion
the
art
of
the
costumier
be
essentially
different
from
that
of
the
couturier
when
marcel
herrand
ask
me
to
design
the
costume
for
sheridan
s
school
for
scandal
in
i
be
work
anonymously
at
piguet
these
be
the
first
costume
to
which
i
put
my
name
later
i
design
costume
for
several
film
or
ballet
but
never
with
any
particular
pleasure
design
for
the
theatre
need
a
quality
of
improvisation
of
sacrifice
of
craftsmanship
to
the
effect
which
be
alien
to
my
temperament
i
have
horrify
memory
of
a
ballet
call
thirteen
woman
which
i
design
at
the
request
of
boris
kochno
and
christian
b
rard
we
end
by
sew
the
costume
on
to
the
back
of
the
dancer
when
they
be
already
in
position
to
dance
across
the
stage
if
i
dislike
entertainment
i
must
confess
that
i
be
still
less
prone
to
reading
with
the
exception
of
balzac
i
never
read
novel
i
be
only
really
interested
in
book
of
history
or
archaeology
painting
of
course
be
my
first
love
and
in
order
to
terminate
the
list
of
my
favourite
distraction
i
will
admit
to
a
great
weakness
for
card
i
spend
hour
bent
over
the
bridge
or
canasta
table
try
to
penetrate
its
mystery
a
sign
of
intellectual
poverty
perhaps
but
it
be
best
to
be
honest
my
faiblesse
as
you
will
have
guess
be
architecture
which
have
fascinate
me
ever
since
i
be
a
child
prevent
by
my
family
and
by
my
circumstance
from
ever
gratify
this
passion
i
found
an
outlet
for
it
in
couture
i
think
of
my
work
as
ephemeral
architecture
dedicate
to
the
beauty
of
the
female
body

give
me
a
far
outlet
for
my
passion
by

me
with
the
money
to
gratify
it
with
the
money
i
receive
from
my
first
collection
i
be
able
to
give
rein
to
my
natural
inclination
as
a
builder
at
that
time
i
be
living

teau
nor
a
weekend
villa
but
a
real
rural
retreat
a
part
of
the
countryside
preferably
with
a
stream
run
through
it
this
rousseauesque
dream
found
its
expression
near
milly
in
the
old
mill
of
coudret
small
plain
building
which
have
be
stable
some
barn
and
the
actual
mill
surround
a
proper
farmyard
in
the
shape
of
a
horse
shoe
the
ancient
roof
be
almost
sound
and
so
be
the
lichen
cover
wall
with
the
exception
of
one
wing
restore
by
the
last
owner
in
execrable
taste
my
first
action
be
to
hack
off
all
his
embellishment
with
an
axe
to
the
consternation
of
the
agent
i
then
turn
my
attention
to
make
the
house
habitable
in
the
style
i
want
the
widely
differ
character
of
the
room
enable
me
to
decorate
them
all
in
the
same
genre
without
fear
of
monotony
i
want
a
house
something
like
those
house
in
the
province
those
whitewash
convent
with
their
well
polished
parlour
where
child
be
brought
to
talk
politely
to
their
relation
of
which
i
preserve
tender
memory
i
want
my
first
country
home
to
look
both
live
in
and
livable
in
my
garden
i
entrust
to
the
care
of
the
faithful
ivan
who
have
do
wonder
with
my
garden
at
fleury
in
spite
of
its
size
i
want
it
to
look
like
the
peasant
garden
which
decorate
the
side
of
the
road
in
my
native
normandy
to
achieve
such
an
effect
the
forest
and
the
river
have
to
be
tame
the
weed
clear
away
then
i
could
retire
into
my
bower
of
flower
and
listen
in
peace
to
the
bell
of
milly
i
have
construct
the
hermitage
of
repose
which
my
soul
need
scarcely
be
the
mill
finish
than
i
be
face
with
the
problem
of
a
house
in
paris
correspond
to
the
social
demand
of
my
official
life
the
flat
in
the
rue
royale
which
i
have
gradually
furnish
in
a
fin
de
si
cle
style
to
my
taste
could
not
live
up
to
my
new
responsibility
i
have
to
face
the
thought
of
leave
it
and
leave
too
the
four
flight
of
stair
which
be
no
doubt
hold
in
check
the
embonpoint
that
be
the
natural
result
of
my
love
of
good
food
i
search
the
whole
of
paris
with
the
exception
of
passy
which
i
sedulously
avoid
true
to
the
fashion
of
the
moment
which
dictate
that
one
must
at
all
cost
live
in
the
th
arrondissement
but
it
seem
that
only
american
be
capable
of
unearth
house
in
the
guermantes
district
i
prospect
in
the
avenue
hoche
and
neuilly
but
without
success
nothing
seem
suitable
i
won
the
reputation
of
be
impossible
to
please
at
the
house
agent
until
once
more
chance
come
to
my
aid
one
morning
my
principal
agent
telephone
me
and
say
in
a
weary
voice
we
ve
found
a
house
which
be
for
sale
but
unfortunately
it
be
in
passy
in
the
boulevard
jules
sandeau
at
that
moment
i
experienced
the
famous
sensation
of
temp
retrouv
i
rush
to
the
address
i
be
give
and
found
to
my
delight
that
it
brought
me
within
fifty
yard
of
rue
alb
ric
magnard
the
home
of
my
youth
there
be
the
balcony
of
column
which
have
so
fascinate
me
in
an
exquisite
little
house
which
have
be
built
in
for
an
actress
through
the
open
door
i
immediately
felt
that
this
be
my
house
it
be
true
that
it
be
laden
with
arabesque
festoon
and
astragal
but
the
layout
of
the
house
be
unexpected
and
delightful
it
include
a
winter
garden
which
immediately
remind
me
of
granville
without
more
ado
without
even
consult
the
architect
i
take
the
house
on
the
spot
and
concentrate
all
my
energy
on
the
decoration
of
my
new
home
the
actress
for
whom
the
house
have
be
built
have
live
a
great
deal
in
st
petersburg
in
the
day
of
the

and
become
obsess
with
fear
of
nihilist
half
blockhouse
and
half
love
nest
the
house
be
the
exact
opposite
of
what
a
peace

bachelor
of

with

much
less
important
than
my
own
taste
for
after
all
living
in
a
house
which
do
not
suit
you
be
like
wear
someone
else
s
clothes
i
like
an
atmosphere
which
have
be
built
up
little
by
little
out
of
the
whim
and
fancy
of
the
inhabitant
if
i
have
to
name
my
favourite
style
for
a
house
i
would
choose
louis
seize
but
it
would
be
louis
seize
a
contemporary
and
therefore
sincere
version
as
i
finish
this
book
i
be
in
the
process
of
finish
the
decoration
of
my
house
in
provence
at
montauroux
near
callian
i
cannot
describe
this
new
house
fully
since
it
be
still
not
complete
it
be
simple
ancient
and
dignify
i
hope
its
dignity
conveys
the
period
of
life
which
i
be
enter
i
think
of
this
house
now
as
my
real
home
the
home
to
which
god
willing
i
shall
one
day
retire
the
home
where
perhaps
i
will
one
day
forget
christian
dior
couturier
and
become
the
neglect
private
individual
again
i
be
in
fact
at
montauroux
as
i
write
these
last
line
fate
have
brought
me
into
the
calm
and
peace
of
the
proven
al
countryside
to
put
the
finish
to
my
work
night
be
fall
and
with
it
infinite
peace
the
avenue
montaigne
seem
far
away
for
i
have
spent
the
day
among
my
vine
inspect
the
future
wine
harvest
the
first
star
have
come
out
and
be
reflect
in
the
pool
opposite
my
window
it
be
the
moment
to
bring
the
two
christian
dior
face
to
face
myself
and
this
siamese
twin
of
mine
to
whom
i
owe
my
success
it
be
fitting
that
we
should
meet
here
among
the
vine
and
the
jasmine
for
i
be
always
more
self
confident
when
i
feel
near
to
the
soil
what
conclusion
do
i
draw
from
this
fateful
meeting
first
of
all
he
and
i
do
not
belong
to
the
same
world
he
life
entirely
in
the
century
to
which
he
owes
his
birth
he
love
to
revolutionize
and
to
shock
i
have
never
lose
the
simple
taste
and
habit
of
my
norman
childhood
my
love
of
solid
well
laid
foundation
it
be
for
this
reason
that
i
have
always
try
to
build
my
fashion
on
a
solid
base
true
luxury
need
good
material
and
good
workmanship
it
will
never
succeed
unless
its
root
be
profoundly
embed
in
sober
influence
and
honest
tradition
lack
of
money
be
turn
the
present
century
away
from
frivolity
the
modern

be

and
straightforward
fantasy
upon
fantasy
extravagance
upon
extravagance
belong
to
the
costumier
not
the
couturier
fashion
be
destine
to
be
worn
elegantly
in
the
street
and
drawingrooms
and
must
obey
its
own
strict
law
mlle
chanel
give
the
best
definition
of
it
when
she
say
couture
creates
beautiful
thing
which
become
ugly
while
art
creates
ugly
thing
which
become
beautiful
i
would
venture
to
correct
mlle
chanel
in
one
respect
there
be
such
a
thing
as
the
posthumous
vengeance
of
fashion
and
the
ugly
can
become
beautiful
again
with
the
passing
of
time
nevertheless
it
be
true
that
we
work
under
an
ephemeral
star
and
only
precision
of
design
excellence
of
cut
and
quality
of
workmanship
can
save
us
i
believe
that
in
my
own
fashion
i
have
work
on
the
same
principle
as
the
other
member
of
my
circle
of
friend
christian

devour
by
a
burning
passion
in
reaction
to
the
law

forbade

of
the

twenty
year

contrast
with
the
michelet
school
of
history
within
my
own
sphere
i
have
be
equally
reactionary
i
have
battle
against
everything
that
i
have
consider
as
triumph
for
the
wrong
reason
i
have
try
to
impose
my
taste
and
temperament
upon
my
clothes
for
a

always
take
its
public
by
storm
as
a
garment
it
must
respect
certain
law
but
as
a
toilette
it
must
dare
certain
extravagance
there
be
room
for
audacity
in
the
tradition
of
couture
a
particular
fashion
plea
or
cease
to
please
accord
to
complex
influence
the
most
successful
fashion
wear
itself
out
the
quick
because
it
be
over
imitate
and
over
propagate
there
will
always
be
certain
woman
who
cling
to
a
particular
style
of
dress
because
they
wore
it
during
the
time
of
their
great
happiness
but
white
hair
be
the
only
excuse
for
this
type
of
extravagance
finally
how
shall
i
explain
the
miracle
of
fashion
itself
the
continued
miracle
of
the
popularity
of
couture
and
the
public
interest
displayed
even
in
the
life
of
the
humble
couturier
i
believe
that
the
answer
lie
in
this
very
miraculous
quality
which
fashion
surely
posse
in
the
world
today
haute
couture
be
one
of
the
last
repository
of
the
mar
vellous
and
the
couturier
the
last
possessor
of
the
wand
of
cinderella
s
fairy
godmother
the
need
for
display
which
be
dormant
in
all
of
us
can
express
itself
nowadays
in
fashion
and
nowhere
else
that
be
why
the
paper
devote
yard
of
space
to
discuss
fashion
and
that
be
why
the
couturier
be
still
able
to
present
a
sumptuous
new
collection
each
season
the
dress
of
this
collection
may
be
worn
by
only
a
few
of
the
thousand
of
woman
who
read
and
dream
about
them
but
high
fashion
need
not
be
directly
accessible
to
everyone
it
be
only
necessary
that
it
should
exist
in
the
world
for
its
influence
to
be
felt
fashion
have
its
own
moral
code
however
frivolous
when
someone
object
to
the
fact
that
certain
of
my
toilette
be
ill
suit
to
the
serious
time
in
which
we
live
i
reply
that
a
period
of
happiness
be
no
doubt
on
the
way
when
these
frivolous
fashion
will
come
into
their
own
the
maintenance
of
the
tradition
of
fashion
be
in
the
nature
of
an
act
of
faith
in
a
century
which
attempt
to
tear
the
heart
out
of
every
mystery
fashion
guard
its
secret
well
and
be
the
best
possible
proof
that
there
be
still
magic
abroad
i
be
speak
lightly
of
fashion
but
my
tone
be
ting
with
respect
the
great
adventure
which
constitutes
parisian
couture
be
not
merely
a
temple
of
vanity
it
be
a
charm
outward
manifestation
of
an
ancient
civilization
which
intend
to
survive
suddenly
i
come
to
view
my
other
self
with
genuine
respect
perhaps
the
wretched
couturier
have
something
to
be
say
for
him
after
all
i
view
him
with
an
altogether
more
friendly
eye
his
role
be
to
be
a
guardian
of
the
public
taste
and
that
be
a
valuable
role
indeed
meanwhile
i
can
lurk
in
his
brilliant
shadow
and
console
myself
that
he
have
left
me
the
best
part
of
our
dual
personality
i
can
take
care
of
the
actual
work
from
the
idea
to
the
dress
while
he
maintains
a
dazzle
worldly
front
for
us
both
ultimately
therefore
i
accept
the
identification
of
myself
with
him
and
ten
year
after
the
found
of
my
house
be
content
that
we
two
the
great
couturier
and
the
shrink
nonentity
should
bear
the
same
name
