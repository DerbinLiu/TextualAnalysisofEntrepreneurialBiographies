a

engineer
in
when
he
have
his

brush
with

at
the

the

produce

they

it
use
computer

different
way
to

my
job
be
to
understand
what
be
happen
so
we
could
design
the
proper
size
equipment
to
do
the
job
retire
corporate

bob

thought
he
have
invent
a

idea
for
slit

product
during
manufacturing
in
it
start
with
a
young
engineer
write
a
letter
vytlacil
say
he
knew
what
he
want
to
accomplish
but
he
didn
t
know
what
the
mechanism
would
look
like
a
few
month
later
vytlacil
be
cleaning
his
garage
and
ran
across
an
old
fishing
reel
i
played
with
it
for
a
few
minute
then
i
toss
it
out
he
say
that
night
i
be
star
at
the
ceiling
and
the
idea
hit
me
between
the
eye
that
be
it
i
didn
t
have
any
money
to
pursue

million
each

make
the

you
ever
saw
vytlacil
say
next
i
get
permission
to
canvas
the
division
at
m
that
i
thought
could
use
this
new
device
and
i
end
up
raise
for
my
project
i
call
it

because
those
be
the
initial
of
the

commercial
product
abrasive
medical
industrial
mineral
tape
and
electrical
product
that
chipped
in

i
built
a

prototype
with
a
hand
crank
like
the
old
fishing
reel
but
large
and
i
put
together
a
little
slide
show
by
this
time
vytlacil
s
work
be
become
more
visible
inside
m
and
despite
be
told
by
his
bos
to
turn
his
energy
to
other
more
promising
assignment
or
lose
my
job
he
persevere
in
classic
m
style
it
be
about
when
vytlacil
get
his
big
break
at
a
gathering
of
specialist
engineer
i
invite
every

i
could
think
of
to
come
and
see
my

and
try
it
out
personally
vytlacil
say
people
really
like
it
later
at
an
engineering

at

vytlacil

i
come
across
the

it

a

at

a

one

at

get

on

of

that

the

a
chance

down

when
the

at

because
as
many
as

the

have
limited
success
however
the
concept
be
a

one

they

so

take
them
seriously
prager

from
the
start
the
goal
be
to

positive
say

the

team
focus
on
what
be
good
about
a

that
need

some
people
have
use
them

the

say
this

usually
pay
attention
conversely
when
a

do
not
score
well
with
the

team
it
be
often
a
motivator
say
prager
i
have
see
it
happen
we
have
say
we
would
love
it
if
you
can
prove
that
our

and
the
response

often

be

it

we
have
absolutely
disastrous
result
say

our
first

work
only
on

it
take

our

tolerate
dry

not

we
knew
we
have
to
find
a
way
to
treat

cotton
make

j

component
in
the

the
fluorochemical

how
could
it
permit
the
removal

that

it

that
the
margin
between
an

and
a

one
be
too
narrow
so
the

continued
look
the

it

you

banitt

there
be
serious
dead
end
and
a

of
frustration
we
d
spend
week
synthesize
a

in

we

it

we

we

it

we

while
some

be

some
be
so
potent
they
could

it

a

that

the

they
reach
the
halfway

in

you
go

that
you

not

anything
well
than
you
already

it

it
would

of
prepare
its

fda
decide
that
tambocor
be
a
significant
enough
drug
that
it
receive
high
priority
in
the
review
process
the
next
year
tambocor
be
sell
in
west
germany
where
the
national
drug
approval
process
be
shorter
determine
which
patient
would
benefit
most
from
tambocor
without
side
effect
be
challenge
at
one
point
grentzkow
have
to
halt
test
a
few
day
later
grentzkow
have
to
face
his
peer
at
an
american
heart
association
annual
meeting
i
can
remember
so
vividly
people
come
up
to
me
on
the
convention
floor
and
say
flecainide
would
never
make
it
to
market
he
say
but
instead
of
give
up
m
quickly
start
more
test
by
november
the
test
result
show
that
tambocor
could
be
use
safely
the
company
ultimate
triumph
come
on
october
when
the
fda
give
m
approval
to
sell
tambocor

it
s
not
over
til
it
s
over
the
bomb
drop
at
a
morning
team
meeting
on
january
the
anti

head
by
richard

be
a
casualty
oftambocor
m
have
decide
to
put
his
team
work
and
others
on
hold
in
order
to
focus
resource
on
the
promising
heart
arrhythmia
drug
it
be
like
get
punch
in
tambocor
a
drug
design
to
control
irregular
heartbeat
be
introduce
in

the
stomach
miller
remember
but
pharmaceutical
need
a
success
and
tambocor
have
be
the
first
product
to
come
out
of
our
drug
discovery
program
we
need
to
get
it
to
market
as
fast
as
possible
and
have
more
money
would
speed
that
up
miller
and
the
biologist
who
report
to
him
be
put
on
m
s
unassigned
list
it
be
time
to
find
another
job
in
the
company
his
colleague
advise
and
do
it
quickly
our
management
set
up
meeting
with
all
of
us
to
talk
about
networking
to
find
new
position
miller
say
but
miller
be
either
too
stubborn
or
persistent
to
walk
away
from
his
promising
project
miller
then
a
research
scientist
have
join
m
in
to
lead
a
team
with
john
gerster
that
be
explore
how
drug
might
fight
off
virus
in
the
human
body
miller
have
focus
his
doctoral
and
postdoctoral
study
on
virus
before
anti
viral
drug
even
exist
he
be
excite
about
this
new
frontier
and
the
work
consume
him
the
development
time
for
pharmaceutical
be
to
year
from
discovery
to
fda
approval
and
it
can
cost
as
much
as
million
only
one
compound
out
of
every
make
it
to
the
market
elden
banitt
the
research
team
s
first
challenge
be
to
create
a
compound
that
would
poison
a
virus
without
destroy
healthy
human
cell
gerster
make
new
compound
base
on
precursor
for
dna
or
rna
miller
say
he
make
a
novel
combination
that
wasn
t
found
in
nature
and
we
hop
it
would
selectively
inhibit
virus
production
my
lab
test
the
drug
that
john
make
in
miller
study
a
promising
compound
supply
by
gerster
and
he
decide
to
test
it
from
the
very
first
experiment
we
be
excite
about
the
result
miller
say
we
repeat
our
experiment
and
we
knew
he
ask
if
it
be
hopeless
miller
s
former
supervisor
ed
erickson
recall
i
say
well
you
re
still
here
and
it
s
not
over
until
ifs
over
minneapolis
star
tribune

we
have
something
totally
new
and
different
we
discover
later
that
our
drug
stimulate
the
immune
system
to
fight
off
a
virus
after
be
put
on
the
unassigned
list
miller
look
for
a
new
position
within
m
but
his
heart
wasn
t
in
it
i
didn
t
do
a
very
good
job
in
my
interview
he
say
when
they
d
ask
what
i
want
most
to
be
do
i
d
say
go
back
and
work
on
anti
viral
drug
some
people
felt
it
wasn
t
possible
to
create
a
drug
that
would
inhibit
a
virus
and
not
be
toxic
to
cell
i
didn
t
agree
richard
miller
and
so
he
do
new
opportunity
weren
t
knock
at
miller
s
door
so
he
go
to
his
manager
ed
erickson
and
ask
if
he
could
continue
work
on
the
research
project
at
least
until
an
offer
come
through
our
team
be
paid
as
long
as
we
be
on
the
unassigned
list
miller
say
we
just
didn
t
have
job
i
told
the
team
it
s
go
to
be
a
while
before
we
have
job
in
the
meantime
let
s
continue
the
experiment
ed
be
very
supportive
and
encourage
us
to
keep
work
gerster
who
be
a
ph
d
chemist
continued
make
compound
for
us
to
test
for
six
month
the
team
continued
its
experiment
and
the
result
be
consistently
good
miller
shop
the
project
around
m
look
for
a
permanent
home
for
the
research
but
his
desire
be
to
remain
in
pharmaceutical
the
team
brought
in
a
nationally
respect
expert
in
anti
viral
drug
to
review
the
result
this
expert
confirm
that
no
other
compound
of
its
kind
exist
by
july
miller
and
team
member
who
hadn
t
go
on
to
other
job
be
reinstate
as
a
full
fledge
research
team
it
be
great
like
have
a
big
weight
lift
miller
say
by
the
end
of
the
year
we
select
the
drug
for
development
imiquimod
by
the
end
of
it
s
really
important
to
keep
management
inform
today
if
i
have
a
result
like
we
have
in
i
d
be
at
my
manager
door
insist
look
at
this
richard
miller
the
team
recommend
the
next
step
develop
formula
for
test
analysis
and
toxicology
before
human
clinical
trial
could
begin
in
we
be
fortunate
to
have
a
number
of
people
in
m
management
who
have
come
through
our
division
and
support
our
work
include
robertson
baukol
meredith
and
erickson
three

of
clinical
test
with

con
tinued
through
and
imiquimod
cream
be
show
to
be
effective
in
treat
genital
wart
meanwhile
the
challenge
pose
in
manufacturing
the
drug
on
a
large
scale
be
significant
say
eric
jensen
manufacturing
technical
manager
pharmaceutical
division
it
be
a
very
different
product
for
m
and
even
for
our
pharmaceutical
division
he
say
the
drug
itself
have
very
complicate
chemistry
ifs
produce
in
a
cream
that
in
itself
be
difficult
to
make
we
make
the
drug
in
here
be
a
brilliant
scientist
who
knew
that
this
drug
have
value
he
be
not
go
to
let
it
die
and
he
found
a
way
to
push
it
forward
richard
miller
embodies
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
of
m
a
person
with
passion
who
won
t
be
stop
john
benson
executive
vice
president
health
care
market
france
and
the
cream
in
the
u
k
and
to
accomplish
that
we
have
to
create
a
whole
new
center
of
manufacturing
excellence
on
top
of
that
the
cream
have
to
be
package
in
exact
small
amount
in
sachet
make
with
a
multilayer
laminate
foil
paper
and
polyethylene
it
take
us
nearly
five
year
to
get
really
good
at
the
manufacturing
process
by
mid
m
submit
its
new
drug
application
to
the

and
in
february
the

cost
about
a
week
for
up
to

aldara
a
highly
effective
treatment
for
genital

also
show
promise
in
treat
other
viral
infection
and
some
form
of
skin
cancer
of
treatment
by
contrast
surgery
for

wart
cost
hundred
of
dollar
and
cause
pain
and
scar
miller
s
persistence
over
year
paid
off
and
his
interest
in
the
subject
have
not
wan
understand
the
body
s
immune
system
be
an
explode
area
of
research
he
say
we
re
learn
more
about
how
to
enhance
immunity
with
drug
back
in
we
knew
about
interferon
and
interlukin
but
today
there
be
as
many
as
different
protein
that
can
affect
the
immune
system
we
hope
to
produce
several
generation
of
immune
response
modifier
topically
apply
aldara
also
have
show
promise
in
treat
other

basal

carcinoma

precancerous
condition

our

miller
now
corporate
scientist

division
say
that
s
the
part
of
the
immune
system
that
you
need
to
get
rid
of
virus
infection
and
tumor
we
think
we
have
make
a
very
important
addition
to
the

doctor

by

that

zippo

expose

the

damage

there
be

atherton
when
percent
of

scrap
the

leak

cover
the

and
wo
not
allow
the
acid
to
damage
the
surface
it
be
like
a
window
frame
that
we
place
over
the
lighter
and
it
allows
only
the
expose
area

atherton

in

they
be

nonexistent
basically
we
have
to
start
from

the
drive

motivation

come
only
after

i

my

seem
limitless
there
be
still
enormous
wound
and
destruction
from

ii
but
there
be
a
terrific
work
ethic
in

be

m
tape

scotchlite

competitor
we
be
relentless
in

fredriksen
say
we
believe
we
could
outperform
our
competitor
at
any
time
and
we
have
an
inventive
campus
back
in
st
paul
that
support
us
but
not
always
m
product
make
in
america
be
not
one
size
fit
all
because
it
have
a
different
format
for
example
european
letterhead
be
a
different
size
so
it
couldn
t
be
use
with
m
s
american
overhead
projector
and
because
electrical
cable
be
large
in

than
the

the
american
mold
for
make

we
couldn

the
road
to

wasn

easy
some
worried
that
a

would
cannibalize
the

in

carlson

innovation
doesn
t
seem
as
important

carlson

heard
discourage

there

make
it
and
if
that
happens
move
on
to
the
next
good
idea
carlson
stuck
with

that
it
would
be
counterproductive
to
mandate
a
zero

discharge
into

stream
because
move

a

the

it

call
the

secretary
in
they
overcame
three
key
technical
obstacle
first
they
need
a
consistent
high
energy
light
source
to
shine
across
a
sheet
of
paper
they
go
to
general
electric
for
that
invention
second
they
need
to
build
a
reflector
that
would
concentrate
light
into
a
narrow
beam
that
cross
the
paper
s
surface
finally
they
have
to
create
a
mechanism
that
position
the
original
document
and
copy
sheet
like
mirror

in

to

thermo

we

that

different
from
anything
else
in

through
the

down
to
the
low
level
possible
we
succeed
in
do
that
in
about
four
year
we
could
go
toe
to
toe
with
the
japanese
and
do
well
because
m

be
limited
to

in
which
we
have
great
strength
like

we
didn

wal

the

for

kept
try
to
fix
the

problem
with
copying
and
magnetic
with
the

solution
so
we
end
up
with
the

answer
one
of
the
positive
side
of
m
be
know
what
its
core
competency
be
the
negative
side
be
when
we
come
across
a
business
thafs
on
the
border
of
our
core
competency
we
still
apply
we
decide
we
have
to
look
at
where

the

of

go
we
examine

heltzer
believe
that
no
matter
how
large
m
becomes
the
spirit
of
innovation
will
stay
intact
as
long
as

pursue
their
best
idea
you
have

who
be
creative
and
willing
to
work
hard
with
an
appetite
for
challenge
he
say
if
you
keep
enough
idea
cooking
some
will
come
along
as

then
when
you
find
you
have

as
much
effort
talent
and
money
into

as
you
can
that
be
mcknight
philosophy
and
it
continue

be
a
sound
one
on
heltzer
watch
from
to
m
add
new
international
company
bring
the
total
outside
the
united

well
before
an
offshore
assignment
be
consider
a
careermaker
and
while
these
company
have
broad
autonomy
and
authority
heltzer
could
see
the
importance
of
integrate
m
international
and
domestic
business
so
that
both
be
operating
with
a
one
company
mindset
regardless
of
geography
that
be
a
hard
sell
but
under
heltzer
this
shift
in
think
begin
give
his
involvement
with
the
origin
and
growth
of

be
a
strong
advocate
of
maintain
solid
trust
relationship

not
come
as
a
result
of
one
day
or
one
hour
or
one
period
of
time
heltzer
say
it
may
take
year
before
it
be
drawn
and
there
have
to
be
a
continue
relationship
to
get
our
story
across
heltzer
be
also
a
proponent
of
strategic
acquisition
even
though
the
company
bias
have
always
be
to
grow
its
own
new
venture
not
everything

no
matter
how
much
we
provide
in
the
way

imagination
and
dollar
heltzer
say
in
the
early
s
sometimes
an
acquisition
be
the
obvious
answer
as
one
who
benefit
from

because
it
happen
while
i
be

i
m
go
to
take
the
blame
for
it

a
very
classy

on
his

around
me

just
want
you

it
be
tough
he
lead
m
with
an
iron
fist
and
he
have
to
do
it
there
be
a
lot
of
decision
to
make
because
the
company
be
grow
fast
not
long
after
become
ceo
herzog
reflect
on
what
it
would

forward
if

herzog
didn
t
set
out
to

but
he
realize
the

herzog
take
a

analyst
in

abrasive
plant
in
i

but
he
would
always
grab
another

my

of
the

the

herzog
have
an

immediately
when

he
gravitate

a
complete
perspective
from

when

he
knew
the

herzog
practice
mcknighfs
philosophy
of

he
allow
people
