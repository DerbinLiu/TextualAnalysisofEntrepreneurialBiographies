preface
that
this
book
tell
the
story
of
general
motor
in
good
part
from
my
point
of
view
be
reasonably
justified
i
trust
by
the
circumstance
that
as
chief
executive
officer
of
the
corporation
for
twenty
three
year
and
as
a
member
of
the
board
and
a
participant
in
its
committee
for
forty
five
year
i
have
be
situate
at
the
focal
point
of
major
policy
make
and
administration
i
trust
too
that
the
use
make
of
material
from
the
past
which
i
either
write
or
be
responsible
for
be
justified
for
a
similar
reason
they
either
make
or
influence
policy
and
thereby
bear
a
relation
to
the
event
of
history
this
approach
to
the
book
make
it
necessary
to
do
a
substantial
amount
of
research
and
it
should
not
be
surprising
therefore
that
considerable
collaboration
be
require
i
be

first
of
all

i
have
undertaken
in
this
book
to
give
an
account
of
the
progress
of
general

there
be
much
to
say
about
the
world
s
large
private
industrial
enterprise
its
history
cover
the
present
century
and
many
part
of
the
earth
wherever
there
be
a
road
to
travel
it
involves
a
good
deal
of
the
modern
development
of
the
engineering
art
tangibly

substantial
quantity
of
the
world
s
locomotive
diesel
and
gas
turbine
engine
and
household
appliance
since
general
motor
be
mainly
a
producer
of
automotive
product
about
percent
of
current
civilian
business
i
have
stayed
for
the
most
part
in
that
area
i
have
however
give
separate
chapter
to
the
non
automotive
area
and
to
general
motor
role
in
war
and
defense
my
impression
of
all
this
after
more
than
sixty
five
year
in
and
around
the
automobile
industry
forty
five
of
them
in
general
motor
proper
be
the
basis
of
this
book
however
the
long
period
cover
in
the
story
the
scale
of
the
subject
itself
and
the
limitation
of
human
memory
lead
me
to
base
the
story
on
the
record
as
well
as
on
my
impression
of
the
past
i
have
also
turn
often
to
the
memory
of
my
associate
to
bring
all
this
into
focus
i
have
center
my
thought
on
certain
element
which
seem
to
me
to
have
influence
most
importantly
the
evolution
of
the
enterprise
broadly
speak
the
origin
and
development
of
general
motor
scheme
of
decentralize
organization
its
financial
control
and
its
concept
of
the
business
as
express
in
its
approach
to
the
intensely
competitive
automobile
market
these
three
element
as
i
see
it
form
the
foundation
of
general
motor
way
of
do
business
as
to
history
i
have
sketch
the
full
span
of
general
motor
life
from
its
found
by
the
industrial
genius
w
c
durant
in
and
earlier
event
to
the
present
but
i
have
concerned
myself
mainly
with
the
period
after
or
what
i
have
call
the
modern
corporation
and
more
particularly
the
period
from
to
when
as
president
and
then
chairman
i
be
chief
executive
officer
of
the
corporation
in
this
period
the
corporation
developed
some
of
the
basic
characteristic
which
it
have
today
i
have
described
the
old
pre
corporation
to
show
what
we
begin
with
when
we
set
out
to
build
the
modern
corporation
as
to
autobiography
i
have
sketch
my
early
history
in
the
industry
and
the
way
i
happen
to
come
into
the
corporation
in
general
motor
and
the
hyatt
roller
bearing
company
an
enterprise
of
which
i
be
the
head
and
part
owner
before
it
become
a
part
of
united
motor
corporation
and
later
of
general
motor
have
be
almost
the
sole
interest
of
my
business
life
since
join
the
corporation
i
have
be
a
substantial
shareholder
in
it
for
a
long
time
i
be
one
of
its
large
individual
shareholder
with
about
percent
of
the
common
stock
almost
all
of
the
fortune
that
this
represent
have
go
and
be
go
into
the
charitable
foundation
which
bear
my
name
and
from
there
into
education
and
scientific
research
in
medical
and
other
field
thus
the
shareholder
s
point
of
view
be
natural
to
me
i
have
always
take
a
strong
stand
for
the
shareholder
especially
in
such
matter
as
representation
on
the
board
of
director
and
its
committee
and
the
payment
of
dividend
yet
i
have
also
consider
myself
as
one
of
the
breed
that
we
now
call
the
executive
management
have
be
my
specialization
on
many
occasion
when
i
be
chief
executive
officer
i
have
individual
responsibility
for
initiate
policy
however
it
be
doctrine
in
general
motor
that
while
policy
may
originate
anywhere
it
must
be
appraise
and
approve
by
committee
before
be
administer
by
individual
in
other
word
general
motor
have
be
a
group
management
comprise
of
very
competent
individual
and
so
i
shall
often
say
we
instead
of
i
and
sometimes
when
i
say
i
i
may
mean
we
in
accounting
for
the
progress
of
general
motor
a
number
of
diverse
element
must
be
recognize
in
the
background
general
motor
could
hardly
be
imagine
to
exist
anywhere
but
in
this
country
with
its
very
active
and
enterprising
people
its
resource
include
its
science
and
technology
and
its
business
and
industrial
know
how
its
vast
space
road
and
rich
market
its
characteristic
of
change
mobility
and
mass
production
its
great
industrial
expansion
in
this
century
and
its
system
of
freedom
in
general
and
free
competitive
enterprise
in
particular
adapt
to
the
distinctive
character
of
the
american
automobile
market
have
be
a
critical
and
rather
complex
element
in
general
motor
progress
if
in
turn
we
have
contribute
to
the
style
of
the
united
state
as
express
in
the
automobile
this
have
be
by
interaction
consider
for
example
that
survival
in
the
automobile
industry
in
the
united
state
have
depend
upon
win
the
favor
of
buyer
of
new
car
each
year
part
and
parcel
of
this
be
the
annual
model
the
spur
to
which
the
organization
must
respond
or
die
the
urge
to
satisfy
this
requirement
be
the
dynamism
of
general
motor
many
thing
regard
the
progress
of
the
enterprise
and
the
industry
fall
into
place
through
an
understand
of
the
annual
model
its
origin
and
evolution
and
the
associate
concept
of
upgrade
car
in
which
general
motor
played
a
prominent
role
in
contrast
to
the
early
ford
organization
i
cannot
fail
to
note
too
that
the
automobile
present
one
of
the
great
industrial
opportunity
in
modern
time
general
motor
be
fortunate
to
be
in
on
the
ground
floor
from
this
thought
have
come
the
concept
of
the
first
two
chapter
deal
with
the
early
period
of
general
motor
furthermore
the
automobile
by
give
general
motor
an
intimate
association
with
the
development
of
the
internal
combustion
engine
enable
us
logically
to
participate
in
the
application
of
this
type
of
prime
mover
to
a
variety
of
power
need
notably
the
airplane
and
the
locomotive
our
growth
have
be
almost
exclusively
in
the
mass
production
of
vehicle
power
by
the
internal
combustion
engine
it
will
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
anyone
that
i
be
enthusiastic
about
general
motor
and
its
performance
but
i
think
i
be
objective
in
say
that
general
motor
have
capitalize
its
historic
opportunity
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
interest
in
and
around
the
enterprise
from
the
shareholder
and
employee
at
one
end
to
the
consumer
at
the
other
however
be
the
large
of
private
industrial
enterprise
with
over
one
million
shareholder
some
employee
billion
in
asset
billion
in
sale
and
billion
in
profit
in
be
a
distinction
that
sometimes
make
the
corporation
a
political
target
i
be
glad
to
meet
the
issue
of
size
for
to
my
mind
the
size
of
a
competitive
enterprise
be
the
outcome
of
its
competitive
performance
and
when
it
come
to
make
thing
like
automobile
and
locomotive
in
large
number
for
a
large
home
country
and
the
world
market
a
large
size
be
fitting
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
dollar
value
of
these
product
be
relatively
high
even
a
small
automobile
producer
may
rank
among
the
first
hundred
large
industrial
corporation
in
the
united
state
growth
or
strive
for
it
be
i
believe
essential
to
the
good
health
of
an
enterprise
deliberately
to
stop
grow
be
to
suffocate
we
have
have
example
of
that
in
american
industry
in
the
automobile
industry
and
in
a
number
of
others
the
process
of
growth
have
give
us
large
scale
enterprise
which
be
now
characteristic
of
our
society
we
do
thing
in
a
big
way
in
the
united
state
i
have
always
believe
in
planning
big
and
i
have
always
discover
after
the
fact
that
if
anything
we
didn
t
plan
big
enough
but
i
do
not
foresee
the
size
of
general
motor
or
have
size
in
mind
as
an
objective
i
simply
take
the
view
that
we
should
go
at
the
job
vigorously
and
without
hamper
restriction
i
put
no
ceiling
on
progress
growth
and
progress
be
related
for
there
be
no
rest
place
for
an
enterprise
in
a
competitive
economy
obstacle
conflict
new
problem
in
various
shape
and
new
horizon
arise
to
stir
the
imagination
and
continue
the
progress
of
industry
success
however
may
bring
self
satisfaction
in
that
event
the
urge
for
competitive
survival
the
strong
of
all
economic
incentive
be
dull
the
spirit
of
venture
be
lose
in
the
inertia
of
the
mind
against
change
when
such
influence
develop
growth
may
be
arrest
or
a
decline
may
set
in
cause
by
the
failure
to
recognize
advance
technology
or
alter
consumer
need
or
perhaps
by
competition
that
be
more
virile
and
aggressive
the
perpetuation
of
an
unusual
success
or
the
maintenance
of
an
unusually
high
standard
of
leadership
in
any
industry
be
sometimes
more
difficult
than
the
attainment
of
that
success
or
leadership
in
the
first
place
this
be
the
great
challenge
to
be
met
by
the
leader
of
an
industry
it
be
a
challenge
to
be
met
by
the
general
motor
of
the
future
it
should
be
clear
from
this
that
i
do
not
regard
size
as
a
barrier
to
me
it
be
only
a
problem
of
management
my
thought
on
that
have
always
revolve
around
one
concept
which
contains
considerable
complexity
in
theory
and
in
reality
the
concept
that
go
by
the
oversimplify
name
of
decentralization
the
general
motor
type
of
organization
coordinate
in
policy
and
decentralize
in
administration
not
only
have
work
well
for
us
but
also
have
become
standard
practice
in
a
large
part
of
american
industry
combine
with
the
proper
financial
incentive
this
concept
be
the
cornerstone
of
general
motor
organizational
policy
an
essential
aspect
of
our
management
philosophy
be
the
factual
approach
to
business
judgment
the
final
act
of
business
judgment
be
of
course
intuitive
perhaps
there
be
formal
way
of
improve
the
logic
of
business
strategy
or
policy
make
but
the
big
work
behind
business
judgment
be
in
find
and
acknowledge
the
fact
and
circumstance
concern
technology
the
market
and
the
like
in
their
continuously
change
form
the
rapidity
of
modern
technological
change
make
the
search
for
fact
a
permanently
necessary
feature
of
the
industry
that
seem
obvious
but
some
of
the
big
change
of
position
in
the
industry
come
about
in
part
because
someone
get
an
idea
he
thought
be
eternal
it
take
more
than
the
structural
design
of
an
organization
however
to
ensure
sound
management
no
organization
be
sounder
than
the
men
who
run
it
and
delegate
others
to
run
it
they
be
in
a
position
to
tip
the
balance
in
a
decentralize
organization
toward
centralization
and
even
one
man
rule
general
motor
long
term
survival
depends
upon
its
be
operate
in
both
the
spirit
and
the
substance
of
decentralization
it
seem
appropriate
in
this
connection
to
speak
of
general
motor
as
an
institution
in
the
corporation
there
be
an
atmosphere
of
objectivity
and
enjoyment
of
the
enterprise
one
of
the
corporation
s
great
strength
be
that
it
be
design
to
be
an
objective
organization
as
distinguish
from
the
type
that
get
lose
in
the
subjectivity
of
personality
let
me
say
however
that
my
experience
tell
me
that
there
be
no
simple
formula
in
this
matter
of
organization
the
role
of
personality
can
be
so
important
that
sometimes
it
be
necessary
to
build
an
organization
or
rather
perhaps
a
section
of
it
around
one
or
more
individual
rather
than
to
fit
individual
into
the
organization
this
will
be
see
in
rather
dramatic
form
in
my
account
of
the
development
of
our
early
engineering
staff
work
great
constraint
however
be
require
when
any
part
of
a
corporation
have
to
be
adapt
to
an
individual
because
there
be
limit
to
this
process
as
well
as
to
the
other
and
as
i
have
say
above
it
be
imperative
for
the
health
of
the
organization
that
it
always
tends
to
rise
above
subjectivity
if
i
have
express
or
imply
in
this
book
a
so
call
ideology
it
be
i
suppose
that
i
believe
in
competition
as
an
article
of
faith
a
mean
of
progress
and
a
way
of
life
it
should
be
recognize
that
competition
take
various
form
general
motor
for
example
have
compete
with
other
enterprise
as
a
type
of
organization
decentralize
and
in
its
long
range
way
of
do
business
upgrade
the
product
as
well
as
in
the
usual
day
to
day
business
activity
the
elder
henry
ford
on
the
other
hand
believe
more
in
centralize
organization
and
in
a
static
car
model
such
competition
in
basic
policy
have
at
time
be
decisive
we
proceed
too
with
a
belief
in
progress
which
be
evident
in
our
forward
investment
planning
we
set
out
to
produce
not
for
the
chosen
few
but
for
the
whole
consumer
public
on
the
assumption
of
a
continuously
rise
standard
of
living
our
interpretation
of
the
significance
of
the
rise
standard
of
living
marked
an
important
difference
between
us
and
others
in
the
formative
year
of
the
modern
market
the
area
in
general
motor
that
i
have
stake
out
for
this
book
be
one
that
be
not
usually
visible
it
extends
from
the
board
of
director
to
the
produce
division
and
consists
of
the
general
administration
the
executive
officer
the
policy
committee
the
line
and
staff
organization
and
the
interaction
between
the
produce
division
in
other
word
the
area
in
which
the
part
contributes
to
the
whole
and
the
whole
to
the
part
not
the
interior
of
the
produce
division
therefore
but
the
interior
of
the
constellation
we
call
general
motor
be
my
subject
the
book
be
divide
into
two
part
part
one
be
an
integrate
continuous
story
of
the
main
line
of
general
motor
progress
involve
the
origin
and
development
of
the
corporation
s
basic
management
concept
in
the
area
of
organization
finance
and
product
part
two
consists
of
individually
distinct
section

in
some
detail
with

distribution
overseas
operation
war
and
defense
product
incentive
compensation
and
other
aspect
and
branch
of
the
enterprise
i
have
not
however
attempt
to
be
comprehensive
it
would
have
be
an
impossible
undertaking
for
me
to
try
to
tell
the
whole
story
of
general
motor
cover
more
than
a
half
century
i
have
select
as
all
author
must
largely
from
my
own
experience
and
i
be
prepared
to
be
judged
accordingly
the
approach
of
this
book
be
to
deal
with
business
from
the
logical
point
of
view
and
to
combine
idea
and
history
the
structure
of
the
book
particularly
the
sequence
of
chapter
in
part
one
result
from
a
consideration
of
the
logic
of
management
in
relation
to
the
event
of
the
automotive
industry
there
be
of
course
other
possible
approach
psychological
sociological
subjective
and
so
forth
the
logical
approach
be
chosen
because
it
make
possible
the
presentation
of
a
large
amount
of
complex
material
in
a
limited
space
it
also
make
it
possible
to
give
a
clear
view
of
the
business
as
a
business
such
an
approach
be
appropriate
to
the
subject
of
general
motor
since
one
aspect
of
the
corporation
s
business
strategy
have
be
a
conscious
effort
to
be
objective
in
the
pursuit
of
business
aim
necessarily
i
have
emphasize
work
do
in
time
past
when
many
long
term
basic
policy
be
first
laid
down
i
recognize
however
that
in
the
operation
of
the
corporation
year
in
and
year
out
new
creative
effort
have
to
be
continuously
make
which
result
in
refining
and
modify
the
early
policy
furthermore
new
policy
have
to
be
formulate
to
meet
new
condition
change
as
i
have
often
say
mean
challenge
and
the
ability
to
meet
challenge
be
the
sign
of
good
management
far
reach
change
in
product
demand
and
outside
pressure
have
have
to
be
met
to
maintain
general
motor
growth
and
prosperity
indeed
the
present
management
of
general

be
meeting
and
take

of
entirely

at
his
high
point
in
the
early

he
produce
more

in
one

the
downfall
of
that
great
car
in
later
year
after
it
have
serve
its
historic
purpose
be
one
of
the
pivotal
fact
of
this
story
both
mr
durant
and
mr
ford
have
unusual
vision
courage
dare
imagination
and
foresight
both
gamble
everything
on
the
future
of
the
automobile
at
a
time
when
few
be
make
in
a
year
than
be
now
make
in
a
couple
of
day
both
create
great
and
last
line
of
product
whose
name
have
be
assimilate
into
the
american
language
both
create
great
and
last
institution
they
be
of
a
generation
of
what
i
might
call
personal
type
of
industrialist
that
be
they
inject
their
personality
their
genius
so
to
speak
as
a
subjective
factor
into
their
operation
without
the
discipline
of
management
by
method
and
objective
fact
their
organizational
method
however
be
at
opposite
pole
mr
ford
be
an
extreme
centralizer
mr
durant
an
extreme
decentralizer
and
they
differ
as
to
product
and
approach
to
the
market
mr
ford
s
assembly
line
automobile
production
high
minimum
wage
and
low
price
car
be
revolutionary
and
stand
among
the
great
contribution
to
our
industrial
culture
his
basic
conception
of
one
car
in
one
utility
model
at
an
ever
low
price
be
what
the
market
especially
the
farm
market
mainly
need
at
the
time
yet
mr
durant
s
feel
for
variety
in
automobile
however
undefined
it
be
then
come
closer
to
the
trend
of
the
industry
as
it
evolve
in
later
year
today
each
major
american
producer
make
a
variety
of
car
mr
durant
be
a
great
man
with
a
great
weakness
he
could
create
but
not
administer
and
he
have
first
in
carriage
and
then
in
automobile
more
than
a
quarter
century
of
the
glory
of
creation
before
he
fell
that
he
should
have
conceive
a
general
motor
and
be
unable
himself
in
the
long
run
to
bring
it
off
or
to
sustain
his
personal
once
dominate
position
in
it
be
a
tragedy
of
american
industrial
history
it
may
not
be
generally
know
that
at
the
turn
of
the
century
mr
durant
who
have
start
from
scratch
be
the
lead
wagon
and
carriage
producer
in
the
united
state
that
he
enter
and
reorganize
the
fail
buick
motor
company
in
and
by
be
the
lead
motorcar
producer
in
the
country
he
built
buicks
in
as
compare
with
a
production
in
that
year
of
ford
and
cadillacs
mr
durant
incorporate
the
general
motor
company
on
september
into
it
he
brought
first
buick
on
october
then
old
on
the
follow
november
and
then
in
oakland
and
cadillac
the
old
company
retain
their
corporate
and
independent
operating
identity
in
the
new
one
which
be
a
hold
company
that
be
a
central
office
surround
by
autonomously
operating
satellite
by
various
mean
mainly
exchange
of
stock
mr
durant
between
and
brought
into
general
motor
about
twenty
five
company
eleven
be
automobile
company
two
be
electrical
lamp
company
and
the
remainder
be
auto
part
and
accessory
manufacturer
of
the
automobile
company
only
four
buick
old
now
oldsmobile
oakland
now
pontiac
and
cadillac
be
to
have
a
permanent
place
first
as
company
later
as
division
in
the
evolution
of
the
corporation
the
other
seven
early
automobile
company
be
only
shadow
enterprise
they
have
principally
engineering
design
and
little
plant
or
production
put
together
organization
in
that
period
often
involve
stock
water
and
other
manipulation
and
this
financial
alchemy
sometimes
change
water
into
gold
i
doubt
whether
that
can
be
say
to
be
the
case
when
the
general
motor
company
be
form
for
buick
be
a
very
profitable
enterprise
before
it
become
the
cornerstone
of
general
motor
it
earn
about
on
about
million
in
sale
in
about
million
on
million
in
sale
in
a
year
of
national
economic
panic
and
an
estimate
million
on
million
in
sale
in
clearly
a
nice
growth
and
profitability
but
mr
durant
be
interested
in
consolidation
through
the
extension
of
his
product
line
and
through
integration
he
be
advanced
for
his
time
in
his
general
method
of
production
unlike
most
early
motorcar
producer
who
merely
assemble
component
make
by
the
part
manufacturer
mr
durant
already
have
buick
make
many
of
its
own
part
and
he
expect
to
bring
about
increase
economy
in
this
direction
a
prospectus
of
his
for
an
unrealized
consolidation
of
buick
with
maxwell
briscoe
motor
company
in
specifies
economy
expect
in
purchasing
sale
and
integrate
production
it
note
that
one
of
buick
s
plant
in
flint
be
situate
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
independent
factory
which
manufacture
body
axle
spring
wheel
and
casting
and
report
that
option
be
held
on
some
of
them
mr
durant
thus
show
a
considerable
sophistication
in
economic
matter
very
different
from
the
popular
image
of
him
as
a
mere
stock
market
plunger
i
cannot
say
that
he
be
precise
in
the
application
of
his
economic
philosophy
but
he
emerge
prominently
from
a
period
that
saw
the
birth
and
death
of
a
great
many
automobile
company
i
see
three
simultaneous
pattern
in
the
way
mr
durant
set
up
general
motor
the
first
be
variety
in
car
for
a
variety
of
taste
and
economic
level
in
the
market
that
be
evident
in
buick
old
oakland
cadillac
and
later
chevrolet
the
second
pattern
be
diversification
calculate
it
seem
to
cover
the
many
possibility
in
the
engineering
future
of
the
automobile
in
search
of
a
high
average
result
instead
of
an
all
or
none
proposition
among
the
non
survivor
in
general
motor
there
be
for
example
the
cartercar
which
have
a
friction
drive
that
be
then
consider
a
potential
rival
of
the
slide
gear
transmission
and
also
the
elmore
manufacturing
company
an
outgrowth
of
a
bicycle
manufacturing
enterprise
which
have
a
two
cycle
motor
that
look
as
if
it
might
have
a
chance
for
a
demand
of
some
kind
there
be
a
number
of
other
random
gamble
which
i
shall
only
name
the
marquette
motor
company
the
ewing
automobile
company
the
randolph
motor
car

company
the

and
the
reliance
motor
truck
company
the
last
two
be
combine
and
name
rapid
truck
which
be
absorbed
by
the
general
motor
truck
company
organize
on
july
the
third
pattern
in
mr
durant
s
arrangement
be
his
effort
mention
in
connection
with
buick
to
increase
integration
through
the
manufacture
of
the
part
and
accessory
that
make
up
the
anatomy
of
the
motorcar
mr
durant
brought
into
the
original
company
a
number
of
component
manufacturer
the
northway
motor
and
manufacturing
company
an

which
have
be
a

carriage
maker
this
company
bought
buick
part
and
manufacture
the
mclaughlin
buick
car
in
canada
this
move
brought
into
association
with
general
motor
the
talent
of
r
samuel
mclaughlin
who
be
to
be
largely
responsible
for
the
development
of

the

interest
from
mr

altogether
from
the
standpoint
of
potential
integration
mr
durant
brought
into
general

in
the
begin
an
important
group
of
component
enterprise
on
the
other
hand
he
also
paid
more
for
a
property
call
the
heany

which
become
worthless
than
he
do
for

old
combine
the
heany

at
a
cost
of
about
million
paid
for
principally
in

security
heany

main
asset
consist
of
an

for
a
patent
for
tungsten
lamp
which
the
patent
office
later
threw
out
mr
durant
s
approach
whatever
its
validity
might
have
be
in
the
long
run
be
in
the
short
run
his
undo
for
buick
and
cadillac
especially
buick
with
its
combination
of
quality
and
volume
be
about
all
the
substance
there
be
to
the

they
account
for
most
of
its
car
production

output
in
the
united

the
rest
of
the

s
car
be
of
little
consequence
and
so
as
it
turn
out
general

be
soon
overextend

thereafter
from

conservatively
they
liquidate

from

to

field
the
company
however
be
in
good
shape
financially
its
efficiency
in
operation
be
due
largely
to
its
then
president
charles
w
nash
mr
nash
come
to
general
motor
in
this
way
he
have
be
with
mr

in
the
durant
dort
carriage
company
for
about
twenty
year
and
have
stayed
on
as
manager
there
when
mr
durant
first
go
into
the
automobile
business
he
be
as
steady
and
careful
as
mr
durant
be
brilliant
and
dare
or
reckless
as
you
may
choose
to
call
it
in
mr
nash
have
have
little
experience
in
automobile
but
he
have
demonstrate
talent
in
the
art
of
manufacturing
and
administration
it
be
i
understand
at
mr
durant
s
suggestion
that
the
banker
mr
storrow
engage
mr
nash
to
take
over
the
management
of
buick
in
any
event
mr

become
president
of

so
well
there
that
he
go
on
to
become

although
the
first
president
of

to
play
a
large
role
in
that

be
in
fact
the
fifth

it
be
no
accident
that

it
be
widely
rumor
then
that

hand
he
assert
a
claim

a
proxy
contest
loom
up

his
earlier
claim

odd
knot
in
which
chevrolet
control
general
motor
be
not
undone
until

he
be

to
have
left

a

that
the

become
an

distinguish
from

company
in

its

take
over
by
the

as
of
august
and
the
latter
become
the
active
operating
corporation
on
that
date
mr
durant
it
appear
then
sought
a
substantial
financial
partner
and
look
to
the
du
pont
group
the
question
arose
in
the
du
pont
company
whether
they
should
come
in
mr
du
pont
outline
the
event
as
follow
he
raskob
believe
it
general
motor
be
a
very
good
investment
for
du
pont
and
give
the
reason
that
the
du
pont
company
need
an
investment
of
good
earn
power
and
good
dividend
power
in
order
to
supplement
its
current
dividend
du
pont
have
lose
the
military
business
or
we
knew
it
would
be
lose
very
shortly
and
in
the
interim
between
the
earnings
of
the
military
business
and
what
might
come
after
that
we
need
something
to
support
the
dividend
of
the
du
pont
company
general
motor
be
already
in
full
swing
they
have
establish
a
good
line
of
car
and
they
be
very
popular
and
there
be
every
promise
that
their
dividend
would
continue
at
the
then
rate
which
be
good
or
maybe
would
be
high
that
be
the
attractive
point
to
raskob
and
it
also
become
my
idea
that
it
be
a
very
good
investment
and
one
that
could
not
be
duplicate
so
far
as
we
knew
anywhere
else
mr
du
pont
state
far
the
general
motor
corporation
and
the
industry
itself
have
not
advanced
to
a
general
acceptance
it
be
regard
as
be
something
very
risky
and
consequently
the
stock
be
sell
at
about
par
at
that
time
which
be
a
very
good
investment
apparently
from
the
actual
earnings
but
the
public
hadn
t
learn
to
believe
that
so
that
the
investment
that
be
possible
to
make
be
extremely
interest
and
that
be
the
start
of
the
proposition
to
the
du
pont
company
we
have
be
through
a
great
many
financial
arrangement
in
relation
to
the
military
business
of
the
du
pont
company
and
durant
need
financing
or
financial
management
in
his
corporation
he
acknowledge
that
he
want
that
and
he
be
very
glad
to
take
on
du
pont
interest
to
run
that
part
of
his
business
in
a
memorandum
to
the
finance
committee
of
the
du
pont
company
date
december
mr
raskob
with
extraordinary
insight
into
the
future
of
the
automobile
industry
argue
for
du
pont
company
participation
in
general
motor
mr
raskob
write
the
growth
of
the
motor
business
particularly
the
general
motor
company
have
be
phenomenal
as
indicate
by
its
net
earnings
and
by
the
fact
that
the
gross
receipt
of
the
general
motor
chevrolet
motor
company
sic
for
the
come
year
will
amount
to
between
and
the
general
motor
company
today
occupies
a
unique
position
in
the
automobile
industry
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
writer
with
proper
management
will
show
result
in
the
future
second
to
none
in
any
american
industry
mr
durant
perhaps
realizes
this
more
fully
than
anyone
else
and
be
very
desirous
of
have
an
organization
as
perfect
as
possible
to
handle
this
wonderful
business
mr
durant
s
association
with
the
du
pont
group
have
be
such
as
to
result
in
the
expression
of
the
desire
on
his
part
to
have
us
more
substantially
interested
with
him
thus
enable
us
to
assist
him
particularly
in
an
executive
and
financial
way
in
the
direction
of
this
huge
business
the
evolution
of
the
discussion
of
this
problem
be
that
an
attractive
investment
be
afford
in
what
i
consider
the
most
promising
industry
in
the
united
state
a
country
which
in
my
opinion
hold
great
possibility
for
development
in
the
immediate
future
than
any
country
in
the
world
that
rather
than
have
a
coterie
of
our
director
take
advantage
of
this
in
a
personal
way
thus
divert
their
time
and
attention
to
some
degree
at
least
from
our
affair
it
would
be
far
preferable
for
the
company
to
accept
the
opportunity
afford
thus
give
our
director
the
interest
so
desire
through
their
stock
ownership
in
the
du
pont
company
in
quote
i
have
follow
original
material
as
closely
as
possible
this
result
in
some
variation
in
spell
punctuation
and
the
like
mr
raskob
summarize
his
view
in
favor
of
the
investment
in
five
point
as
follow
the
first
be
that
with
mr
durant
the
du
pont
company
would
have
joint
control
the
second
be
that
the
du
pont
people
would
assume
charge
and
be
responsible
for
the
financial
operation
of
the
company
the
third
be
a
forecast
of
expect
return
the
fourth
be
that
the
purchase
would
be
make
on
well
than
an
asset
basis
the
fifth
i
quote
our
interest
in
the
general
motor
company
will
undoubtedly
secure
for
us
the
entire
fabrikoid
pyralin
paint
and
varnish
business
of
those
company
which
be
a
substantial
factor
the
entry
of
the
du
pont
interest
into
general
motor
become
the
basis
of
a
suit
by
the
government
against
du
pont
and
general
motor
file
in
or
more
than
thirty
year
after
the
fact
the
basic
charge
be
that
the
acquisition
violate
the
antitrust
law
and
have
enable
du
pont
to
secure
for
its
own
benefit
the
business
of
general
motor
in
product
produce
by
du
pont
this
charge
be
deny
by
general
motor
and
du
pont
the
district
court
after
hearing
testimony
over
a
period
of
several
month
of
a
broad
cross
section
of
the
active
participant
in
the
matter
and
the
examination
of
many
hundred
of
document
found
there
be
no
evidence
to
support
the
contention
of
the
government
and
dismiss
the
case
the
supreme
court
on
review
held
that
the
acquisition
by
the
du
pont
interest
some
thirty
year
earlier
be
illegal
because
there
be
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
acquisition
be
likely
to
result
in
a
restraint
of
trade
the
supreme
court
agree
however
with
the
find
of
the
trial
court
state
that
consideration
of
price
quality
and
service
be
not
overlook
by
either
du
pont
or
general
motor
and
that
all
concerned
in
high
executive
post
in
both
company
act
honorably
and
fairly
each
in
the
honest
conviction
that
his
action
be
in
the
best
interest
of
his
own
company
and
without
any
design
to
overreach
anyone
include
du
pont
s
competitor
the
trial
court
s
judgment
of
dismissal
be
reverse
and
the
case
remand
for
relief
on
remand
and
after
far
litigation
and
appeal
the
district
court
decreed
that
the
du
pont
interest
divest
themselves
of
their
general
motor
stock
over
a
period
of
year
it
appear
to
me
as
a
layman
that
the
reason
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
case
be
almost
purely
academic
and
be
not
support
by
the
reality
of
the
situation
as
found
by
the
district
court
on
december
the
du
pont
board
on
the
recommendation
of
pierre

du

authorize
the

have
then
the
making
of
a
great

but
it
be
in
good
part
physically
unintegrated
and
in

uncoordinated
the
expenditure
for

and
inventory
be
terrific
some
of
them
not
to
bring
a

for
a
long
time
if
ever
and
as
they
go
up
the
cash
go
down
general
motor
be
head
for
the
crisis
from
which
the
modern
general
motor
corporation
would
emerge
chapter
the
great
opportunity
ii
to
tell
how
i
come
into
general
motor
it
be
necessary
to
begin
with
small
matter
than
those
i
have
described
i
be
born
in
new
haven
connecticut
on
may
a
time
when
to
say
the
least
the
style
of
the
united
state
be
quite
different
from
what
it
be
today
my
father
be
in
the
wholesale
tea
coffee
and
cigar
business
with
a
firm
call
bennett
sloan
and
company
in
he
move
the
business
to
new
york
city
on
west
broadway
and
from
the
age
of
ten
i
grow
up
in
brooklyn
i
be
told
i
still
have
the
accent
my
father
s
father
be
a
schoolteacher
my
mother
s
father
be
a
methodist
minister
my
parent
have
five
child
of
whom
i
be
the
old
there
be
my
sister
mr
katharine
sloan
pratt
now
a
widow
there
be
my
three
brother
clifford
who
be
in
the
advertising
business
harold
a
college
professor
and
raymond
the
young
who
be
a
professor
writer
and
expert
on
hospital
administration
i
think
we
have
all
have
in
common
a
capability
for
be
dedicate
to
our
respective
interest
i
come
of
age
at
almost
exactly
the
time
when
the
automobile
business
in
the
united
state
come
into
be
in
the
duryeas
who
have
be
experiment
with
motor
car
start
what
i
believe
be
the
first
gasoline
automobile
manufacturing
company
in
the
united
state
in
the
same
year
i
left
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
with
a
b
s
in
electrical
engineering
and
go
to
work
for
the
hyatt
roller
bearing
company
of
newark
later
of
harrison
new
jersey
the
hyatt
antifriction
bearing
be
later
to
become
a
component
of
the
automobile
and
it
be
through
this
component
that
i
come
into
the
automotive
industry
except
for
one
early
and
brief
departure
from
it
i
have
spent
my
life
in
the
industry
hyatt
then
be
a
tiny
enterprise
employ
about
twenty
five
people
a
ten
horsepower
motor
drove
all
of
its
plant
machinery
its
product
be
a
special
kind
of
antifriction
bearing
invent
by
john
wesley
hyatt
who
also
invent
celluloid
the
first
of
the
modern
plastic
material
intend
but
never
realize
as
a
substitute
for
ivory
in
billiard
ball
at
that
time
antifriction
bearing
be
not
well
developed
or
well
know
but
the
hyatt
bearing
be
no
cruder
than
other
mechanical
part
make
in
those
day
and
we
be
able
to
put
some
of
our
bearing
on
travel
crane
papermill
equipment
mine
car
and
other
machinery
we
be
do
a
business
when
i
go
with
the
company
of
under
a
month
i
be
a
kind
of
office
boy
draftsman
salesman
and
general
assistant
to
the
enterprise
at
a
salary
of
a
month
i
do
not
then
see
much
future
in
hyatt
and
soon
left
it
to
become
associate
with
a
household
electric
refrigerator
enterprise
which
seem
to
offer
well
prospect
it
be
make
one
of
the
early
effort
to
supply
centrally
locate
electric
refrigeration
in
apartment
house
after
about
two
year
i
come
to
believe
that
its
particular
product
could
not
develop
because
of
its
complicate
mechanism
and
high
cost
meanwhile
affair
of
the
hyatt
roller
bearing
company
have
not
progress
very
well
the
company
have
never
be
on
a
profit
make
basis
and
it
come
to
the
point
where
the
individual
who
be
promote
it
john
e
searles
be
not
willing
to
put
up
any
more
money
to
cover
the
loss
in
it
appear
that
the
company
would
have
to
liquidate
but
my
father
and
an
associate
of
his
combine
to
put
into
hyatt
with
the
understand
that
i
would
go
back
for
six
month
and
see
what
i
could
do
with
it
i
accepted
the
proposition
and
team
up
with
a
young
man
peter
steenstrup
who
be
then
the
bookkeeper
later
the
sale
manager
at
the
end
of
six
month
we
have
make
some
advance
in
volume
and
economy
and
a
profit
and
that
put
the
business
in
a
position
where
we
recognize
that
it
might
be
make
successful
i
assume
the
high
title
of
general
manager
i
could
not
know
then
that
through
hyatt
i
have
enter
one
of
the
headwater
of
general
motor
for
the
next
four
or
five
year
at
hyatt
we
have
grow
pain
it
be
difficult
to
get
business
and
when
we
get
it
and
expand
we
need
work
capital
that
we
could
not
get
outside
the
company
it
be
easy
at
that
time
however
to
build
a
business
from
scratch
because
the
government
do
not
tax
away
the
profit
as
it
do
now
in
five
year
we
make
progress
our
profit
get
up
to
about
a
year
and
the
prospect
improve
as
the
young
automobile
industry
open
up
a
new
market
it
be
around
the
turn
of
the
century
that
the
automobile
business
begin
to
break
out
in
numerous
small
enterprise
antifriction
bearing
come
into
the
picture
then
and
we
begin
to
get
a
few
order
from
those
who
be
experiment
with
automobile
a
letter
i
write
to
henry
ford
on
may
ask
for
his
business
be
say
by
allan
nevins
in
his
biography
of
ford
to
be
on
file
in
the
ford
archive
mr
ford
at
that
time
be
experiment
with
automobile
and
be
about
to
go
into
the
business
but
in
the
first
decade
of
this
century
the
application
of
our
bearing
in
the
mechanical
art
expand
slowly
most
of
the
hundred
of
automobile
company
organize
in
that
period
make
only
sample
car
and
then
expire
my
partner
mr
steenstrup
do
a
great
deal
of
travel
to
make
sale
contact
with
these
embryo
producer
when
he
saw
or
heard
of
someone
who
be
go
to
make
a
new
car
i
would
get
in
touch
with
the
person
and
go
into
the
problem
from
the
engineering
point
of
view
i
would
design
hyatt
bearing
into
the
axle
or
perhaps
some
other
part
and
in
do
so
facilitate
the
sale
of
our
roller
bearing
in
any
subsequent
production
as
our
work
become
well
know
i
succeed
in
get
myself
into
a
position
where
i
be
a
kind
of
consult
sale
engineer
to
a
good
many
of
those
company
and
their
supplier
on
bearing
problem
to
which
our
particular
product
be
applicable
i
would
be
call
in
when
any
change
of
design
or
new
design
be
contemplate
and
this
give
me
the
opportunity
to
get
our
bearing
incorporate
into
the
rear
axle
or
the
transmission
or
both
this
sale
engineering
of
ours
continued
at
an
increase
pace
especially
from
to
when
some
of
the
manufacturer
such
as
ford
cadillac
buick
old
hudson
reo
willys
and
others
begin
to
develop
important
volume
hyatt
s
business
flow
logically
wherever
we
have
customer
like
these
that
stayed
in
business
and
grow
our
business
become
so
good
that
it
get
to
be
a
question
of
how
rapidly
we
could
expand
our
production
with
new
building
new
machinery
new
method
and
the
like
to
keep
up
with
the
rapidly
expand
automobile
business
my
first
personal
experience
with
automobile
be
much
like
that
of
others
at
the
time
i
want
one
but
couldn
t
afford
it
only
about
car
be
make
in
the
year
and
they
be
expensive
my
father
bought
one
of
the
early
wintons
as
a
family
car
around
i
bought
for
the
hyatt
company
a
car
call
the
conrad
which
we
get
for
company
purpose
and
incidentally
use
to
go
from
the
plant
in
harrison
into
newark
for
lunch
and
errand
it
have
a
two
cycle
engine
with
four
cylinder
and
be
a
good
look
car
paint
red
but
it
be
a
lemon
the
conrad
be
manufacture
from
to
and
then
pass
out
of
the
picture
we
get
another
car
call
the
autocar
this
one
work
well
and
i
use
it
to
some
extent
on
business
trip
and
sometimes
go
to
atlantic
city
in
it
like
the
winton
and
the
conrad
it
be
discontinue
but
an
autocar
truck
be
developed
and
become
a
factor
in
the
automotive
industry
autocar
be
consolidated
with
the
white
motor
company
in
the
first
car
i
bought
for
myself
be
a
cadillac
about
as
be
the
custom
then
i
get
a
cadillac
chassis
and
have
the
body
make
to
order
early
cadillac
engineering
have
an
important
influence
on
the
industry
and
upon
my
operation
in
hyatt
this
be
largely
due
to
henry
leland
who
i
believe
be
one
of
those
mainly
responsible
for
bring
the
technique
of
interchangeable
part
into
automobile
manufacturing
his
first
work
in
the
industry
be
for
old
around
he
be
at
the
head
of
cadillac
when
it
go
into
general
motor
in
and
he
remain
at
the
head
of
it
until
when
he
retire
afterward
he
create
the
lincoln
car
which
he
sell
to
the
ford
motor
company
mr
leland
be
one
of
my
early
acquaintance
in
the
industry
he
be
a
generation
old
than
i
and
i
look
upon
him
as
an
elder
not
only
in
age
but
in
engineering
wisdom
he
be
a
fine
creative
intelligent
person
quality
be
his
god
i
have
trouble
at
first
in
the
early
s
in
sell
mr
leland
our
roller
bearing
he
then
taught
me
the
need
for
great
accuracy
in
our
product
to
meet
the
exact
standard
of
interchangeable
part
mr
leland
come
to
the
industry
with
a
mature
experience
in
general
engineering
and
in
gasoline
engine
which
he
have
long
make
for
boat
one
of
his
specialty
be
precision
metalwork
which
go
back
to
his
experience
in
toolmaking
for
a
federal
arsenal
during
the
civil
war
and
which
he
afterward
developed
in
the
brown
and
sharpe
company
machine
tool
maker
of
providence
rhode
island
it
have
be
call
to
my
attention
that
eli
whitney
long
before
have
start
the
development
of
interchangeable
part
in
connection
with
the
manufacture
of
gun
a
fact
which
suggests
a
line
of
descent
from
whitney
to
leland
to
the
automobile
industry
the
cluster
of
men
who
make
the
industry
in
the
begin
be
not
large
as
a
supplier
of
an
important
component
of
the
automobile
i
come
to
know
most
of
them
over
the
period
of
the
first
twenty
year
of
the
business
and
i
learn
a
great
deal
from
them
as
business
associate
and
friend
in
the
early
day
i
sometimes
sell
direct
to
automobile
producer
cadillac
ford
and
others
but
more
often
i
sell
to
a
supplier
who
in
turn
sell
a
component
of
the
automobile
to
the
assembler
one
of
the
most
important
of
these
supplier
for
me
be
the
weston
mott
company
of
utica
maker
of
axle
a
rear
axle
would
take
six
bearing
some
of
which
be
hyatt
type
after
charles
stewart
mott
move
his
company
from
utica
to
flint
in
to
be
close
to
the
area
where
the
automobile
industry
be
develop
i
make
it
a
practice
to
visit
him
there
once
a
month
i
recall
that
both
side
of
saginaw
street
the
main
street
of
flint
be
line
with
hitch
post
and
on
saturday
night
the
street
be
crowd
with
the
horse
wagon
and
carriage
that
brought
the
farmer
into
town
for
their
weekly
shopping
and
night
out
in
that
set
a
small
society
of
automobile
and
part
producer
met
socially
and
on
business
for
several
year
mr
mott
charles
nash
walter
chrysler
harry
bassett
myself
and
others
all
of
whom
except
myself
be
then
in
general
motor
i
must
have
see
mr
durant
there
too
but
i
can
only
recall
see
him
on
the
train
between
new
york
and
detroit
and
our
say
good
even
and
good
morning
my
real
connection
with
general
motor
then
be
through
mr
mott
who
have
take
his
company
into
general
motor
in
and
be
a
supplier
of
axle
to
buick
oakland
and
old
to
be
exact
general
motor
acquire
percent
of
his
company
s
stock
in
and
the
balance
in
through
weston
mott
i
succeed
in
get
hyatt
roller
bearing
into
general
motor
car
i
first
knew
walter
chrysler
in
flint
as
work
manager
and
then
head
of
buick
he
would
pas
judgment
on
my
product
when
the
axle
design
come
in
from
weston
mott
we
saw
a
lot
of
each
other
in
the
course
of
time
in
general
motor
and
out
of
it
and
be
personal
friend
throughout
his
life
in
later
year
when
we
be
rival
head
of
our
respective
enterprise
chrysler
and
general
motor
we
sometimes
take
a
vacation
trip
together
with
business
taboo
on
those
occasion
mr
chrysler
be
a
man
of
high
ambition
and
imagination
he
be
a
practical
man
with
broad
capability
his
genius
i
think
be
in
the
organization
of
automobile
production
like
mr
nash
he
recognize
the
opportunity
offer
by
the
young
and
promising
automobile
business
they
both
be
true
leader
of
its
early
development
and
become
head
of
great
enterprise
over
at
the
ford
motor
company
in
detroit
i
as
a
hyatt
salesman
use
to
see
mr
ford
and
occasionally
have
lunch
with
him
but
i
conduct
my
business
there
mainly
through
c
harold
will
his
chief
engineer
and
later
the
creator
of
the
fine
but
short
live
will
sainte
claire
automobile
mr
ford
owe
much
to
mr
will
talent
in
engineering
especially
metallurgy
because
of
our
ability
at
hyatt
to
produce
and
deliver
reliably
we
be
eventually
favor
with
percent
of
the
ford
business
to
the
extent
that
our
bearing
be
applicable
to
the
ford
design
as
mr
ford
s
company
grow
he
become
our
best
customer
with
general
motor
second
the
development
of
hyatt
s
volume
cause
me
to
open
a
sale
office
in
detroit
on
west
grand
boulevard
in
later
year
through
an
unpredictable
chain
of
event
this
office
be
to
become
the
nucleus
of
the
site
of
the
general
motor
building
in
detroit
one
day
in
the
spring
of
i
receive
a
call
from
mr
durant
ask
me
to
come
in
to
see
him
as
the
founder
of
general
motor
and
chevrolet
mr
durant
be
a
celebrate
figure
in
the
automobile
and
financial
world
i
have
described
how
he
have
be
out
of
general
motor
for
a
number
of
year
and
be
about
to
return
at
that
time
as
president
i
found
mr
durant
a
very
persuasive
man
soft
spoken
and
ingratiate
he
be
short
conservatively
and
immaculately
dress
and
have
an
air
of
be
permanently
calm
though
he
be
continuously
involve
in
big
and
complicate
financial
deal
and
he
inspire
confidence
in
his
character
and
ability
he
ask
me
if
the
hyatt
roller
bearing
company
be
for
sale
after
all
those
year
of
building
up
the
hyatt
business
the
idea
of
sell
it
be
a
shock
to
me
but
it
open
up
a
new
vista
in
my
think
and
cause
me
to
analyze
the
situation
at
hyatt
mr
durant
s
offer
brought
forcibly
to
my
mind
a
combination
of
three
factor
that
be
develop
in
the
business
the
first
of
these
be
that
because
of
the
way
hyatt
s
business
have
evolve
it
have
come
to
depend
upon
a
limited
number
of
customer
ford
alone
represent
about
half
of
the
sale
this
business
if
lose
could
not
be
replace
because
no
new
customer
of
such
magnitude
exist
a
complete
reorganization
would
have
to
be
undertaken
second
i
recognize
that
the
kind
of
roller
bearing
we
make
at
that
time
be
destine
through
the
evolution
of
automobile
design
to
be
supplement
and
perhaps
supersede
by
other
type
and
what
then
another
reorganization
a
different
product
in
effect
a
new
business
i
have
always
be
interested
in
improve
a
product
but
this
be
a
special
product
business
and
the
choice
be
whether
to
proceed
independently
or
within
an
integrate
enterprise
i
may
say
that
in
the
past
forty
five
year
what
i
thought
would
happen
to
the
product
have
happen
hyatt
s
old
type
of
antifriction
bearing
have
go
out
of
automobile
design
along
with
other
type
of
then
exist
antifriction
bearing
third
i
have
spent
my
work
life
i
be
forty
year
old
then
develop
a
property
and
i
have
a
large
plant
with
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
but
i
never
get
much
yield
out
of
it
in
dividend
mr
durant
s
offer
present
an
opportunity
to
convert
hyatt
s
profit
into
readily
salable
asset
of
the
three
factor
i
think
the
second
the
potential
change
in
the
old
hyatt
roller
bearing
be
decisive
in
my
mind
thus
the
way
i
add
it
up
be
that
while
hyatt
s
short
term
profit
position
be
good
the
long
term
position
would
benefit
from
the
propose
association
and
mr
durant
s
offer
promise
a
conversion
of
asset
i
decide
to
take
the
offer
get
my
four
director
together
and
recommend
that
we
tell
mr
durant
that
we
be
prepared
to
sell
at
a
price
of
million
a
couple
of
the
director
thought
the
price
be
high
but
i
do
not
think
so
consider
our
strength
and
the
growth
potential
of
the
automobile
industry
i
enter
negotiation
with
two
of
mr
durant
s
associate
john
thomas
smith
his
lawyer
and
louis
g
kaufman
the
banker
and
after
a
lot
of
dicker
back
and
forth
settle
on
a
proposition
to
sell
the
property
for
million
when
the
question
of
payment
come
up
i
agree
to
take
half
in
cash
and
half
in
the
stock
of
a
new
enterprise
that
mr
durant
propose
to
organize
call
united
motor
corporation
but
when
it
come
to
closing
the
deal
i
found
that
some
of
my
hyatt
associate
be
unwilling
to
take
stock
in
the
new
company
this
lead
to
my
have
to
take
more
than
my
share
of
the
stock
and
give
up
the
equivalent
in
cash
since
my
father
and
i
own
a
substantial
part
of
hyatt
i
finish
with

the
leader

and

by

the

i
have
give
here
to
the

be
not
a
measure
of
its
relative
position
in
the
general
motor
scheme
of
thing
it
just
get
me
into
the
story
in
a
logical
way
i
join
general
motor
as
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
same
accessory

in

from
through
my
operating
responsibility
continued
to
be
with
the
accessory
group
but
as
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
corporation
my
horizon
again
widen
also
i
have
proprietary
as
well
as
professional
reason
for
take
an
interest
in
the
corporation
as
a
whole
since
most
of
my
personal
asset
have
be
convert
into
general
motor
share
it
be
not
long
therefore
before
i
begin
to
take
a
close
look
at
mr
durant
s
general
policy
i
be
of
two
mind
about
mr
durant
i
admire
his
automotive
genius
his
imagination
his
generous
human
quality
and
his
integrity
his
loyalty
to
the
enterprise
be
absolute
i
recognize
as
mr
raskob
and
pierre
s
du
pont
have
that
he
have
create
and
inspire
the
dynamic
growth
of
general
motor
but
i
thought
he
be
too
casual
in
his
way
for
an
administrator
and
he
overload
himself
important
decision
have
to
wait
until
he
be
free
and
be
often
make
impulsively
two
example
from
my
personal
experience
my
office
be
next
door
to
his
in
the
old
general
motor
building
on
new
york
s
fifty
seventh
street
i
would
sometimes
go
in
to
see
him
one
day
in
i
go
in
and
told
him
that
i
thought
that
in
view
of
the
large
public
interest
in
the
corporation
s
share
we
should
have
an
independent
audit
by
a
certify
public
accountant
our
book
be
not
then
be
so
audit
though
they
have
be
earlier
under
the
banker
regime
mr
durant
do
not
have
a
sound
concept
of
accounting
as
such
and
do
not
realize
its
great
significance
in
administration
however
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
he
say
at
once
that
he
agree
with
me
and
told
me
to
go
and
get
one
that
be
the
way
he
work
he
have
a
financial
department
to
handle
affair
of
that
kind
but
since
i
have
make
the
suggestion
i
get
the
assignment
i
brought
in
the
firm
of
haskins
sell
which
have
audit
the
account
at
united
motor
this
firm
still
audit
general
motor
account
another
time
i
found
mr
durant
in
his
office
with
some
people
talk
about
the
new
office
building
that
be
to
be
put
up
in
detroit
it
be
to
be
call
the
durant
building
but
be
now
know
as
the
general
motor
building
they
be
inspect
a
map
of
detroit
mr
durant
as
usual
invite
me
to
come
into
the
discussion
they
be
consider
a
location
in
the
grand
circus
park
area
downtown
the
united
motor
sale
office
on
west
grand
boulevard
be
uptown
north
a
couple
of
mile
i
knew
the
location
well
and
it
be
natural
that
i
should
think
of
it
there
be
good
reason
for
consider
it
for
the
new
building
it
be
closer
for
everyone
who
live
on
the
north
side
of
the
city
and
at
that
time
the
traffic
there
be
lighter
than
downtown
i
mention
these
thing
to
mr
durant
whereupon
he
turn
to
me
and
say
that
the
next
time
we
go
to
detroit
we
would
all
go
up
and
take
a
look
at
it
and
we
do
i
can
see
mr
durant
now
he
start
at
the
corner
of
ca
avenue
pace
a
certain
distance
west
on
west
grand
boulevard
past
the
old
hyatt
building
which
have
become
the
united
motor
building
then
he
stop
for
no
apparent
reason
at
some
apartment
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
building
he
say
that
this
be
about
the
ground
we
want
and
turn
to
me
and
say
as
well
as
i
can
remember
alfred
will
you
go
and
buy
these
property
for
us
and
mr
prentis
will
pay
whatever
you
decide
to
pay
for
them
i
wasn
t
in
the
real
estate
business
i
didn
t
even
live
in
detroit
but
i
go
ahead
and
organize
the
assembly
of
the
property
and
if
i
do
say
so
myself
i
think
we
do
a
good
job
i
assign
ralph
s
lane
president
of
the
united
motor
service
corporation
to
handle
the
purchase
of
property
it
be
an
interest
piece
of
business
to
buy
up
a
block
of
small
parcel
of
real
estate
if
you
disclose
your
intention
you
influence
the
price
when
we
get
the
half
block
that
mr
durant
want
he
say
we
ought
to
buy
the
rest
of
it
so
we
go
back
to
work
and
bought
the
whole
block
i
don
t
know
that
he
intend
to
use
all
of
it
immediately
but
it
be
soon
use
the
general
motor
building
which
be
built
there
start
a
new
business
district
in
detroit
mr
durant
s
informal
way
of
do
business
be
often
effective
in
that
formative
period
and
for
the
confidence
he
place
in
me
on
these
and
other
occasion
i
have
reason
to
feel
well
dispose
toward
him
the
criticism
i
make
of
him
be
purely
from
the
viewpoint
of
basic
business
administration
i
be
particularly
concerned
that
he
have
expand
general
motor
between
and
without
an
explicit
policy
of
management
with
which
to
control
the
various
part
of
the
organization
a
distinction
should
be
make
between
the
expansion
itself
and
the
need
for
organization
which
grow
out
of
it
there
may
have
be
disagreement
at
the
time
over
the
soundness
of
the
expansion
program
responsibility
for
which
be
share
by
mr
durant
and
mr
raskob
but
time
in
the
long
run
have
show
that
the
major
part
of
the
program
at
least
so
far
as
the
automobile
development
be
concerned
be
sound
and
desirable
since
the
automobile
be
a
high
value
product
make
for
a
mass
market
the
industry
need
an
extensive
capital
structure
mr
durant
and
mr
raskob
anticipate
this
need
as
to
organization
we
do
not
have
adequate
knowledge
or
control
of
the
individual
operating
division
it
be
a
management
by
crony
with
the
division
operating
on
a
horse
trading
basis
when
walter
chrysler
one
of
the
best
men
in
general
motor
become
a
general
executive
of
the
corporation
he
collide
with
mr
durant
over
their
respective
jurisdiction
i
believe
mr
chrysler
be
a
man
of
strong
will
and
feel
when
he
could
not
get
the
arrangement
he
want
he
left
the
corporation
i
remember
the
day
he
bang
the
door
on
the
way
out
and
out
of
that
bang
come
eventually
the
chrysler
corporation
the
significance
of
the
weakness
in
general
motor
organization
be
not
clearly
visible
during
world
war
i
and
for
a
time
during
the
postwar
inflation
it
first
take
critical
form
in
late
and
at
this
time
large
sum
be
be
allot
upon
request
to
all
division
for
plant
expansion
program
and
at
the
same
time
rise
material
and
labor
cost
ate
up
these
fund
before
the
project
expansion
could
be
complete
there
be
overrun
on
appropriation
that
be
expenditure
beyond
the
establish
limit
by
almost
every
division
it
be
a
case
of
competition
among
the
division
for
available
capital
and
of
different
preference
at
the
top
for
example
mr
durant
be
strong
on
tractor
the
finance
committee
on
october
turn
back
his
request
for
tractor
appropriation
with
a
request
for
far
information
on
the
expect
return
on
investment
at
the
same
meeting
the
finance
committee
support
a
request
of
mine
for
about
million
for
the
new
departure
division
then
mr
durant
at
an
executive
committee
meeting
on
october
oppose
the
appropriation
request
for
new
departure
later
in
the
same
meeting
the
committee
agree
to
finance
new
departure
to
the
extent
of
one
third
of
the
request
the
other
two
third
to
come
from
a
prefer
stock
issue
at
the
same
meeting
mr
durant
oppose
a
request
for
million
for
additional
cost
on
the
durant
general
motor
building
in
detroit
accord
to
the
memory
of
meyer
l
prentis
then
treasurer
of
general
motor
mr
durant
oppose
the
supplementary
appropriation
for
the
durant
building
because
in
opposition
to
mr
raskob
he
prefer
to
allocate
fund
to
plant
and
work
capital
rather
than
to
real
estate
john
l
pratt
who
have
left
du
pont
to
assist
mr
durant
also
remembers
this
difference
in
investment
preference
the
incident
be
recall
to
my
mind
by
the
memory
of
mr
durant
leave
the
chairman
s
seat
to
take
another
one
at
the
table
and
make
the
motion
not
to
grant
the
request
the
executive
committee
support
him
there
be
in
fact
as
he
saw
a
shortage
of
fund
to
meet
all
these
demand
attention
thereupon
be
give
not
to
the
question
of
how
to
divide
scarce
investment
fund
but
how
to
raise
more
money
the
finance
committee
meeting
in
new
york
on
november
heard
a
report
from
mr
durant
show
estimate
receipt
and
expenditure
for
the
fifteen
month
end
december
and
after
discussion
it
be
move
and
unanimously
carry
that
the
expenditure
propose
in
say
report
should
go
forward
and
immediate
step
be
take
to
arrange
for
the
sale
of
par
value
debenture
stock
and
if
possible
an
additional
make
a
total
of
that
afternoon
the
executive
committee
met
in
new
york
and
take
up
the
same
matter
the
minute
say
mr
j
j
raskob
chairman
of
the
finance
committee
come
before
the
meeting
and
make
a
brief
report
as
to
future
financing
he
recommend
that
the
company
sell
an
additional
amount
of
its
debenture
stock
and
that
it
proceed
to
take
action
upon
the
several
appropriation
request
which
be
not
grant
at
the
last
meeting
the
executive
committee
then
unanimously
pass
the
appropriation
for
the
durant
building
new
departure
the
tractor
and
the
rest
and
the
finance
committee
approve
them
later
in
a
study
of
our
appropriation
procedure
i
reflect
on
this
situation
as
follow
the
practical
result
of
the
lack
of
a
proper
appropriation
procedure
therefore
be
that
the
approval
of
any
member
of
the
executive
committee
of
an
appropriation
request
by
a
division
over
which
he
have
supervision
necessarily
carry
with
it
the
support
of
the
other
member
of
the
executive
committee
in
other
word
from
the
practical
standpoint
the
supervision
suppose
to
be
exercise
by
the
executive
committee
be
more
theoretical
than
practical
accordingly
everyone
who
have
an
appropriation
request
to
make
be
to
be
satisfied

but
only
million
be
realize
this
be
the
first
signal
from
the
outside
financial
environment
that
the
corporation
be
in
conflict
with
reality
despite
its
growth
in
sale
from
million
in
to
million
in
which
would
become
million
in
the
competition
for

appropriation
brought
to
the
fore
the
whole
question
of
financial
organization
on
december
mr
durant
state
in
the
executive
committee
that
the
prevail
method
of
handle
appropriation
request
be
unsatisfactory
a
proposition
on
which
all
could
agree
he
outline
a
procedure
for
investigate
these
request
and
reporting
them
to
the
president
i
embody
this
in
a
motion
for
a
special
committee
of
which
mr

be
make

at
the

properly
to

responsibility
for
authorize

this
be
one
of
three
project
in
the
field
of
organization
which
i
undertook
in
this
period
the
main
thing
to
note
here
be
that
neither
the
executive
committee
nor
the
finance
committee
have
the
need
information
or
the
need
control
over
the

the

continued
to
spend
lavishly
and
their
request
for
additional
fund

met
the
minute
of
the

not
unusual
overrun
on
capital
investment
have
become
the
rule

question
of
the
corporation
s
ability
to
meet
an
economic
slump
come
up
at
the
end
of
on

of

this
reason
i
presume
the
lead

do
not
then
appreciate
how
critical
would
be
the
significance
of
the
lack
of

over
the
action
of
the

late
in
february
however
mr

the

serious
for

that
many

have
difficulty
in
locate
cash
to
pay
invoice
and

in
that
month
we
borrow
about
million
from

on
short
term
note
in

all
the
major
car

virtually
shut
down

those
two
be
operating
at
reduce
rate
the
whole
economy
of
the
united
state
fell
into
a
slump
before
these
event
take
place
i
have
become
increasingly
disturbed
by
the
trend
of
affair
inside
general
motor
in
late
and
early
i
developed
a
plan
of
organization
intend
to
correct
deficiency
in
the
operating
organization
and
present
it
to
mr
durant
he
appear
to
accept
it
favorably
though
he
do
nothing
about
it
i
think
this
be
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
he
be
not
prepared
then
to
take
up
organizational
matter
he
be
overburden
with
all
manner
of
immediate
operating
and
personal
financial
problem
which
make
it
extremely
difficult
for
him
to
consider
a
broad
plan
of
this
kind
my
anxiety
about
the
management
of
the
corporation
and
the
direction
it
be
take
become
such
that
in
the
early
summer
of
i
ask
for
a
thirty
day
vacation
to
get
away
and
decide
what
i
should
do
everything
i
own
be
tie
up
in
the
stock
of
the
corporation
at
first
i
thought
that
like
mr
chrysler
i
should
retire
from
general
motor
i
have
a
potential
offer
of
a
partnership
in
the
banking
firm
lee
higginson
and
company
with
the
prospect
of
work
on
industrial
analysis
the
offer
come
from
mr
storrow
who
as
i
have
described
have
direct
the
financial
affair
of
general
motor
in
the
period
and
who
have
since
become
the
principal
backer
of
nash
motor
i
hesitate
about
make
this
change
and
go
to
europe
to
think
it
over
my
hesitation
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
do
not
feel
that
i
should
protect
my
financial
position
by
sell
my
shareholding
while
mr
durant
rightly
or
wrongly
be
try
with
every
resource
at
his
command
to
maintain
the
market
value
of
general
motor
stock
in
the
crisis
in
england
i
order
a
roll
royce
with
the
intention
of
go
on
a
tour
with
my
wife
but
i
never
take
delivery
of
the
roll
or
make
the
tour
i
return
to
the
united
state
in
august
and
find
that
a
considerable
change
have
take
place
and
that
the
situation
be
come
to
a
head
i
decide
to
wait
the
business
slump
of
be
accompany
as
be
often
the
case
by
a
break
in
stock
market
price
this
together
with
the
near
closing
of
most
of
the
general
motor
plant
brought
to
an
end
an
era
in
the
corporation
s
history
a
record
of
the
event
lead
to
mr
durant
s
resignation
from

down
by

the
letter
be
date
november
dear
sir
recent
development
in
general
motor
corporation
s
affair
make
it
necessary
to
record
development
of
the
past
two
week
which
i
do
from
note
make
by
me
and
from
circumstance
that
be
still
clearly
in
mind
before
deal
with
this
part
of
the
history
i
should
like
to
record
a
few
word
in
regard
to
my
previous
understand
of
mr
durant
s
personal
affair
since
my
first
acquaintance
with
mr
durant
some
year
ago
he
have
never
up
to
thursday
november
th
say
anything
to
me
concern
his
personal
affair
when
the
du
pont
interest
bought
into
the
general
motor
company
and
acquire
an
investment
of
worth
of
stock
at
slightly
above
par
it
be
understood
from
mr
durant
that
he
possibly
together
with
his
immediate
family
held
a
similar
amount
of
stock
include
his
holding
in
the
chevrolet
company
which
be
then
as
now
a
hold
company
of
general
motor
common
stock
it
be
know
to
us
at
that
time
that
the
large
part
of
mr
durant
s
stock
stood
in
the
name
of
broker
but
this
be
suppose
to
be
a
matter
of
convenience
i
be
quite
sure
that
if
mr
durant
be
a
borrower
on
this
stock
at
the
time
nothing
be
say
about
it
during
the
month
that
follow
our
acquisition
of
stock
up
to
last
spring
i
knew
at
time
that
mr
durant
have
permit
his
stock
to
be
lent
in
the
street
i
also
knew
that
he
be
at
time
purchaser
of
stock
both
directly
and
through
advise
people
to
buy
i
have
never
suppose
that
he
purchase
other
than
by
payment
outright
or
in
amount
within
his
ability
to
carry
in
view
of
his
seemingly
large
fortune
i
do
not
remember
his
mention
any
case
in
which
he
be
a
seller
of
stock
nor
do
it
appear
now
that
he
have
ever
be
other
than
a
purchaser
i
have
never
abet
mr
durant
in
any
thought
of
stock
and
market
control
which
he
mention
to
me
in
fact
what
little
have
be
say
would
tend
to
discourage
market
operation
rather
than
to
encourage
them
but
as
i
say
before
mr
durant
have
never
spoken
to
me
about
personal
affair
and
it
have
never
appear
that
the
stock
operation
be
anything
but
personal
i
have
a
strong
impression
which
mr
raskob
confirms
that
mr
durant
be
entirely
out
of
the
stock
market
in
the
spring
of
i
have
suppose
that
he
owe
no
money
particularly
on
broker
account
when
syndicate
be
form
in
recent
month
by
morgan
company
it
be
my
understand
that
mr
durant
would
not
operate
in
the
stock
market
in
any
way
as
it
be
impossible
for
two
party
to
act
independently
in
a
satisfactory
way
i
have
be
disappointed
during
recent
week
to
hear
mr
durant
mention
support
the
market
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
morgan
syndicate
be
not
do
so
properly
my
judgment
have
be
against
this
independent
action
but
i
be
not
sure
that
the
subject
have
be
discuss
in
a
way
that
have
indicate
to
mr
durant
any
clearcut
idea
on
my
part
in
fact
i
have
picture
his
purchase
to
sustain
the
market
as
be
limited
to
a
number
of
share
well
within
his
suppose
purchasing
power
and
that
of
his
immediate
friend
who
might
be
help
him
in
place
the
stock
i
have
felt
quite
certain
up
to
november
th
that
mr
durant
be
not
operating
in
the
stock
market
and
be
not
a
borrower
of
money
notwithstanding
the
above
opinion
that
be
quite
firmly
fix
in
my
mind
there
have
be
rumor
of
durant
s
speculation
both
mr
raskob
and
i
have
felt
that
morgan
company
have
be
ignorant
of
the
extent
of
mr
durant
s
operation
since
they
become
purchaser
of
general
motor
common
stock
morgan
company
have
have
every
opportunity
to
question
mr
durant
on
the
subject
and
i
have
not
felt
it
my
duty
to
pry
into
durant
s
affair
some
time
within
the
past
six
week
mr
dwight
w
morrow
of
morgan
company
ask
mr
raskob
and
me
some
question
regard
mr
durant
s
personal
affair
particularly
as
to
his
possible
stock
market
operation
to
this
we
reply
that
we
knew
nothing
of
his
personal
affair
and
that
he
have
never
confide
in
us
i
advise
mr
morrow
that
he
question
mr
durant
personally
as
we
felt
sure
that
he
would
be
candid
in
his
answer
this
lead
to
a
meeting
in
mr
morrow
s
office
in
november
at
which
he
mr
durant
mr
raskob
and
i
be
present
during
that
meeting
i
state
that
it
be
fair
that
the
partner
in
ownership
of
general
motor
stock
should
know
each
others
position
and
inform
the
meeting
on
the
part
of
the
du
pont
interest
that
all
of
our
stock
both
general
motor
and
chevrolet
be
held
by
the
company
unpledged
and
that
we
be
not
buyer
or
seller
of
stock
in
any
amount
i
also
state
that
i
personally
be
not
a
borrower
of
money
on
the
stock
that
my
share
be
held
by
me
and
that
i
have
not
bought
or
sell
stock
recently
i
state
that
so
far
as
i
knew
none
of
the
individual
in
the
du
pont
group
be
borrower
on
general
motor
stock
or
operating
in
any
way
mr
morrow
state
that
the
share
purchase
by
morgan
company
and
their
friend
be
still
held
and
that
there
be
no
intention
to
sell
i
do
not
remember
that
mr
durant
make
as
positive
a
statement
on
his
part
but
he
do
not
give
any
intimation
that
he
be
a
borrower
on
the
stock
or
operating
in
the
market
in
any
way
mr
morrow
ask
him
the
direct
question
whether
he
knew
of
any
weak
account
in
the
market
to
which
durant
reply
no
he
left
us
with
the
impression
that
his
holding
be
as
clear
as
our
own
know
mr
durant
and
the
peculiarity
of
his
makeup
i
do
not
think
that
he
intend
to
deceive
us
in
any
way
but
mr
morrow
who
be
not
inclined
to
be
as
generous
i
think
censure
mr
durant
severely
for
his
failure
to
be
frank
with
us
we
now
come
to
thursday
november
th
without

that
mr
durant
be
involve
in

demand
his
resignation
as
president
of
the
general
motor
company
to
which
demand
he
be
ready
to
accede
as
he
be
determine
to
play
the
game
for
the
reason
that
the
company
as
well
as
he
personally
be
in
the
hand
of
the
banker
and
must
act
accordingly
i
immediately
take
exception
to
his
statement
about
the
company
explain
that
our
borrowing
be
not
great
than
could
be
prudently
carry
in
view
of
our
large
work
capital
and
other
asset
and
in
view
of
the
cash
balance
carry
by
the
company
and
the
forecast
of
our
financial
affair
i
explain
that
our
banking
partner
concur
in
this
opinion
and
saw
no
difficulty
in
carry
our
loan
until
liquidation
through
the
operation
of
the
business
could
be
accomplish
mr
durant
state
that
he
be
worried
about
his
personal
account
but
make
no
definite
explanation
and
no
opportunity
be
present
for
an
inquiry
which
do
not
seem
necessary
at
the
time
however
after
leave
this
meeting
mr
raskob
speculate
on
the
probable
meaning
of
mr
durant
s
word
in
answer
to
mr
raskob
s
question
the
next
day
as

time

office
in
the
morning
with
the
determination
to
endeavor
to
find
out
his
true
position
as
we
have
agree
in
conversation
that
durant
s
personal
affair
if
seriously
involve
might
indirectly
affect
the
credit
of
general
motor
company
mr
durant
be
very
busy
that
day
see
people
rush
to
the
telephone
and
in
and
out
of
his
room
so
that
although
we
wait
patiently
for
several
hour
interrupt
only
by
lunch
time
it
be
not
until
four
o
clock
that
afternoon
that
mr

us
figure
indicate
his
situation
he

at

the
total
memoranda
as
write
down
by
us
from
what
he
say
show
an
indebtedness
of
twenty
million
dollar
all
presumably
on
broker
account
and
support
by
share
of
stock
own
by
others
and
by
an
unknown
amount
of
collateral
belonging
to
durant
also
which
durant
estimate
he
owe
personally
to
bank
and
broker
against
which
he
held
three
million
share
of
general
motor
stock
this
of
course
exclusive
of
the
share
own
by
others
mr
durant
state
that
he
have
no
personal
book
or
account
and
be
wholly
unable
to
give
definite
statement
as
to
the
total
indebtedness
what
part
of
it
be
his
personal
and
what
part
be
the
indebtedness
of
others
on
which
he
have
lent
collateral
without
other
commitment
apparently
he
have
no
summary
of
broker
account
in
hand
however
the
whole
situation
besides
be
very
involve
seem
very
serious
mr
durant
promise
to
ask
his
broker
for
account
in
order
to
make
some
positive
statement
on
tuesday
even
nov
th
mr
durant
have
a
call
from
mcclure
jones
reed
broker
for
to
support
his
account
this
amount
be
fix
up
in
some
way
on
wednesday
nov
th
we
inquire
for
the
broker
account
and
found
that
direction
have
be
give
to
make
the
statement
as
of
the
close
of
business
wednesday
november
th
so
that
nothing
could
be
do
that
day
meantime
the
statement
already
give
appear
so
indefinite
that
mr
raskob
and
i
be
loath
to
believe
the
account
in
any
way
accurate
however
the
situation
seem
serious
enough
to
warrant
speculate
on
a
plan
for
relief
we
decide
that
in
order
to
avert
a
crisis
it
might
be
possible
to
organize
a
company
to
take
over
mr
durant
s
holding
issue
of
note
which
would
be
offer
as
collateral
to
the
holder
of
obligation
and
that
the
du
pont
interest
might
invest
or
even
in
security
of
the
company
in
order
to
furnish
cash
to
liquidate
press
account
and
make
payment
in
part
of
others
on
thursday
november
th
the
broker
account
start
to
come
in
and
it
require
all
of
that
day
to
get
the
statement
in
shape
that
be
agree
upon
by
mr
durant
as
correct
the
statement
however
be
not
capable
of
accurate
check
except
from
the
broker
account
present
there
be
nothing
to
show
that
these
cover
all
the
broker
account
and
there
be
nothing
very
definite
in
regard
to
bank
loan
nor
to
the
syndicate
account
in
which
mr
durant
be
involve
as
lender
of
collateral
however
a
summary
sheet
be
make
up
from
the
data
and
give
to
the
typist
for
copying

that
his
position
differ
so
entirely
from
that
represent
to
us
and
to
morgan
co
that
it
be
impossible
for
us
to
sit
in
a
meeting
with
him
and
the
morgan
partner
unless

agree
to
make
a
complete
statement
to
them

preliminary
i

i
have
prepared
but
which
i
have
not
yet
myself
see
in
finish
form
then
ensue
a
discussion
of
the
whole
subject
in
which
the
morgan
partner
outline
their
opinion
of
the
extreme
seriousness
of
the
situation
and
the
panic
that
might
result
in
the
event
of
mr
durant
s
failure
which
might
possibly
involve
the
failure
of
several
broker
and
some
of
the
bank
particularly
as
there
be
two
large
and
critically
weak
account
in
the
street
mr
morrow
state
that
he
would
give
up
an
engagement
and
return
at
nine
o
clock
and
i
agree
to
break
an
engagement
and
do
likewise
our
conversation
occupy
not
much
more
than
a
half
hour
i
return
to
the
hotel
and
together
with
mr
raskob
go
to
the
office
at
the
appoint
time
where
three
morgan
partner
have
assemble
mr
raskob
outline
to
mr
morrow
our
rough
plan
of
give
assistance
in
which
it
appear
that
we
represent
the
du
pont
interest
be
willing
to
help
materially
in
this
very
desperate
situation
mr
morrow
state
that
he
thought
the
plan
impossible
of
execution
because
of
the
very
critical
condition
in
the
market
and
recommend
that
we
endeavor
to
place
a
loan
of
among
the
bank
in
order
that
an
offer
of
cash
for
all
mr
durant
s
indebtedness
might
be
make
mr
raskob
and
i
agree
on
part
of
the
du
pont
interest
that
we
could
furnish
and
sufficient
additional
collateral
toward
the
project
the
morgan
partner
be
very
complimentary
as
to
the
willingness
of
du
pont
to
help
in
the
situation
mr
cochran
use
the
expression
that
there
be
two
firm
in
this
country
who
be
real
sport
viz
du
pont
and
morgan
discussion
ensue
as
to
the
treatment
of
mr
durant
mr
morrow
make
the
suggestion
that
one
fourth
of
the
equity
in
the
share
should
remain
with
durant
and
that
some
portion
of
this
equity
might
have
to
be
use
in
order
to
help
place
the
note
he
state
in
the
begin
that
morgan
company
would
ask
no
commission
or
payment
of
any
kind
for
their
service
in
the
deal
this
division
of
the
equity
be
discuss
with
careful
consideration
of
justice
to
mr
durant
and
those
carry
the
load
after
this
preliminary
discussion
the
morgan
partner
state
that
they
must
go
as
carefully
as
possible
into
mr
durant
s
account
before
any
attempt
be
make
to
float
a
loan
this
investigation
they
propose
to
start
upon
immediately
and
therefore
go
to
mr
durant
s
room
and
check
of
the
account
be
carry
forward
and
the
proposition
of
relief
present
to
mr
durant
by
mr
morrow
mr
durant
thought
that
one
fourth
of
the
equity
return
to
him
be
harsh
mr
morrow
then
move
to
one
third
mr
durant
suggest
to
me
that
to
him
and
to
the
du
pont
interest
would
be
more
nearly
fair
this
part
of
the
negotiation
be
all
in
good
spirit
and
with
apparent
endeavor
on
all
side
to
be
just
in
a
difficult
situation
check
of
account
and
discussion
of
the
subject
continued
without
interruption
until
about
o
clock
friday
morning
about
which
time
mr
durant
and
i
sign
a
memorandum
agree
to
the
general
proposition
of
a
note
issue
and
issue
of

to
support
the

by

also
the

mr
durant
resign
as
president
of
general
motor
with
all
i
have
say
in
appraise
mr
durant
s
method
he
be
no
more
responsible
than
be
mr
raskob
for
the
collision
between
general
motor
expansion
and
the
business
cycle
mr
raskob
go
ahead
push
the
expansion
and
pay
the
bill
mr
durant
s
management
method
let
thing
get
out
of
control
i
have
heard
that
mr
durant
become
pessimistic
about
the
national
economy
in
late
but
i
can
find
no
record
of
it
on
the
record
both
mr
durant
and
mr
raskob
be
strong
optimistic
expansionists
they
seem
to
disagree
on
occasion
only
on
what
to
put
the
money
into
i
think
that
mr
durant
s
personal
stock
market
operation
be
motivate
essentially
by
his
great
pride
in
general
motor
and
everything
relate
to
it
and
by
his
unbounded
confidence
in
its
future
a
judgment
that
have
be
well
vindicate
over
the
year
i
think
also
that
the
arrangement
the
morgan
and
du
ponts
make
with
him
to
take
over
his
stock
obligation
in
such
a
critical
period
be
a
generous
one
consider
the
follow
mr
durant
in
sell
back
to
the
du
ponts
his
interest
in
the
company
form
to
bail
him
out
he
receive
for
his
interest
share
of
general
motor
stock
whose
market
value
at
the
time
of
acquisition
be
mr
durant
s
disposition
of
those
share
be
not
part
of
this
story
however
their
market
value
if
he
have
held
them
to
the
time
of
his
death
march
would
have
be
on
which
he
would
have
receive
an
aggregate
of
in
dividend
and
from
the
sale
of
right
to
return
to
the
event
of
the
slump
in
the
national
economy
and
its
impact
on
the
corporation
the
lack
of
control
of
operation
and
mr
durant
s
resignation
shook
the
enterprise
to
its
foundation
and
start
an
entirely
new
period
in
its
history
which
be
where
the
main
part
of
my
story
begin
chapter
concept
of
the
organization
at
the
close
of
the
year
the
task
before
general
motor
be
reorganization
as
thing
stood
the
corporation
face
simultaneously
an
economic
slump
on
the
outside
and
a
management
crisis
on
the
inside
the
automobile
market
have
nearly
vanished
and
with
it
our
income
most
of
our
plant
and
those
of
the
industry
be
shut
down
or
assemble
a
small
number
of
car
out
of
semifinished
material
in
the
plant
we
be
load
with
high
price
inventory
and
commitment
at
the
old
inflate
price
level
we
be
short
of
cash
we
have
a
confuse
product
line
there
be
a
lack
of
control
and
of
any
mean
of
control
in
operation
and
finance
and
a
lack
of
adequate
information
about
anything
in
short
there
be
just
about
as
much
crisis
inside
and
outside
as
you
could
wish
for
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
we
be
not
alone
among
automobile
company
others
be
also
in
trouble
that
be
no
particular
comfort
for
economic
decline
have
a
way
of
shake
out
the
weak
one
in
business
and
we
have
weakness
some
people
cannot
see
beyond
a
slump
but
i
have
never
yield
to
economic
pessimism
and
in
time
of
decline
have
kept
in
mind
the
eventual
upturn
of
the
business
cycle
and
the
long
range
dynamic
of
growth
confidence
and
caution
form
my
attitude
in
we
could
not
control
the
environment
or
predict
its
change
precisely
but
we
could
seek
the
flexibility
to
survive
fluctuation
in
business
the
immediate
future
of
the
automobile
market
be
to
say
the
least
uncertain
however
we
believe
in
the
future
of
the
product
as
well
as
of
the
economy
i
mention
this
because
confidence
be
an
important
element
in
business
it
may
on
occasion
make
the
difference
between
one
man
s
success
and
another
s
failure
it
be
our
settle
belief
that
the
automobile
be
then
in
the
course
of
create
a
new
transportation
system
in
the
united
state
and
that
the
market
for
it
therefore
be
bound
in
time
to
return
with
strength
we
state
this
in
the
annual
report
for
along
with
a
review
of
the
progress
of
the
automobile
industry
up
to
that
time
and
give
our
attention
to
the
problem
at
hand
before
anything
else
we
have
to
have
a
new
president
to
take
the
place
of
mr
durant
i
do
not
have
to
think
twice
to
decide
who
i
thought
should
be
the
new
president
i
knew
pierre
s
du
pont
in
a
personal
way
only
slightly
but
it
be
apparent
that
he
be
the
one
individual
in
general
motor
who
have
the
prestige
and
respect
that
could
give
confidence
to
the
organization
to
the
public
and
to
the
bank
and
whose
presence
could
arrest
the
demoralization
that
be
take
place
he
be
chairman
of
the
corporation
and
he
represent
the
large
shareholder
interest
he
have
show
his
capability
for
business
leadership
in
the
du
pont
company
and
in
his
financial
association
with
general
motor
the
only
other
man
in
the
corporation
who
might
have
be
consider
for
president
be
john
j
raskob
mr
du
pont
s
close
and
influential
adviser
and
chairman
of
general
motor
finance
committee
mr
raskob
s
alger
boy
career
have
be
told
many
time
i
do
not
personally
know
his
early
year
but
the
story
be
that
he
go
to
work
as
a
typist
and
secretary
to
pierre
s
du
pont
around
the
turn
of
the
century
mr
du
pont
be
impressed
with
his
lively
imagination
and
financial
capability
as
mr
du
pont
move
up
to
be
treasurer
of
the
du
pont
company
mr
raskob
move
with
him
as
his
assistant
and
adviser
succeed
him
as
treasurer
of
the
du
pont
company
mr
du
pont
and
mr
raskob
be
very
close
business
associate
for
many
year
but
they
do
not
at
all
have
the
same
kind
of
temperament
mr
raskob
be
brilliant
and
imaginative
where
mr
du
pont
be
steady
and
conservative
mr
du
pont
be
tall
well
built
and
reticent
he
would
not
put
himself
forward
mr
raskob
be
short
and
not
reticent
he
be
very
friendly
a
fine
fellow
to
talk
with
and
a
man
of
big
idea
i
remember
his
often
come
into
my
office
with
an
idea
and
want
to
get
it
into
action
by
wave
a
magic
wand
he
would
want
the
whole
organization
to
come
to
a
meeting
right
off
his
fault
if
they
should
be
call
that
be
those
that
go
with
an
aggressive
impatient
intelligence
the
very
thing
that
make
him
good
not
many
men
foresaw
the
future
of
the
automobile
industry
as
well
as
he
do
both
mr
raskob
and
mr
du
pont
thus
have
their
strong
point
but
on
balance
it
seem
to
all
of
us
who
be
concerned
that
mr
du
pont
be
the
man
we
need
no
one
else
at
the
time
could
qualify
in
so
many
particular
there
be
only
one
drawback
mr
du
pont
have
no
intimate
knowledge
of
the
automobile
business
i
happen
to
be
one
of
the
old
school
who
think
that
a
knowledge
of
the
business
be
essential
to
a
successful
administration
but
in
the
situation
that
exist
then
the
immediate
need
for
a
general
constructive
leadership
in
administration
and
a
re
establishment
of
confidence
in
the
future
be
more
important
than
intimate
knowledge
of
the
business
other
men
be
available
or
could
be
obtain
who
have
that
knowledge
hence
i
urge
in
the
informal
discussion
that
take
place
that
mr
du
pont
be
the
logical
choice
not
that
my
urge
have
much
or
anything
to
do
with
the
decision
other
person
be
more
influential
and
mr
du
pont
have
reason
of
his
own
for
allow
himself
to
be
persuade
to
accept
management
as
well
as
financial
responsibility
in
general
motor
the
du
pont
company
have
take
over
the
durant
stock
in
the
crisis
and
by
would
increase
its
ownership
to
about
percent
of
the
total
common
stock
of
the
general
motor
corporation
mr
du
pont
have
an
obvious
responsibility
in
the
situation
he
later
say
i
be
very
loath
to
accept
the
position
of
president
i
have
recently
retire
from
business
but
i
say
that
i
would
do
whatever
they
thought
best
and
i
be
put
in
as
president
with
the
distinct
understand
that
i
be
only
to
stay
there
until
a
well
post
man
could
be
found
to
take
the
job
when
pierre
s
du
pont
accepted
the
presidency
mr
raskob
continued
as
chairman
of
the
finance
committee
and
for
several

serve
as
the
public
spokesman
of

in

but
the
consequence
can
be
far
reach
as
they

in
this
instance
the
first
business
of

about
a
year
earlier
under
the
title
organization
study
and
submit
to
mr
durant
for
his
consideration
since
this
plan
have
become
the
foundation
of
management
policy
in
the
modern
general
motor
an
expression
of
the
basic
principle
of
decentralization
that
govern
its
organization
and
be
say
thereby
to
have
have
some
influence
on
large
scale
industrial
enterprise
in
the
united
state
i
shall
say
something
here
about
its
origin
and
substance
it
be
only
in
recent
year
that
i
have
have
occasion
to
recall
the
surround
circumstance
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
be
able
to
place
the
approximate
time
when
i
draft
the
study
it
be
at
the
end
of
some
time
after
december
and
before
january
instead
of
in
the
spring
of
as
i
have
long
thought
i
reach
this
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
the
study
refers
to
the
appropriation
committee
which
be
create
by
the
executive
committee
on
december
and
from
a
letter
to
me
from
h
h
bassett
then
general
manager
of
buick
date
january
in
which
he
express
his
enthusiasm
for
the
study
i
have
read
over
every
word
of
the
attach
report
and
i
firmly
believe
it
be
a
wonderfully
thought
out
scheme
of
organization
and
certainly
have
my
unqualified
endorsement
say
mr
bassett
very
kindly
i
reply
to
him
on
january
as
follow
my
dear
harry
i
have
your
letter
of
january
th
and
be
pleased
to
note
that
the
plan
in
general
meet
with
your
approval
and
support
i
do
not
know
what
action
if
any
be
go
to
be
take
but
i
hope
that
something
will
be
work
out
that
will
be
satisfactory
to
all
because
i
really
believe
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
thing
a
little
more
definitely
arrange
first
as
to
its
origin
it
have
be
suppose
by
some
student
that
general
motor
take
its
decentralize
type
of
organization
from
the
du
pont
company
as
a
result
of
the
relationship
of
the
two
company
both
management
at
that
time
be
in
fact
independently
concerned
with
problem
of
organization
and
both
eventually
adopt
principle
of
decentralization
but
they
proceed
from
opposite
pole
the
du
pont
company
then
be
evolve
from
a
centralize
type
of
organization
common
in
the
early
day
of
american
industry
while
general
motor
be
emerge
from
almost
total
decentralization
general
motor
need
to
find
a
principle
of
coordination
without
lose
the
advantage
of
decentralization
these
different
background
of
the
general
motor
corporation
and
the
du
pont
company
together
with
the
difference
in
nature
and
marketing
of
the
product
of
the
two
enterprise
make
it
impractical
for
the
same
model
of
organization
to
serve
properly
for
both
of
them
du
pont
executive
have
be
work
on
their
own
reorganization
problem
for
a
couple
of
year
but
it
be
not
until
nine
month
after
general
motor
adopt
its
plan
of
organization
that
the
du
pont
company
also
adopt
a
decentralize
scheme
the
two
plan
do
not
share
their
particular
but
only
the
management
philosophy
of
decentralization
the
two
type
of
operating
problem
one
arise
from
too
much
centralization
du
pont
and
the
other
from
too
much
decentralization
general
motor
be
soon
to
be
met
by
many
large
american
manufacturing
enterprise
one
reason
perhaps
why
general
motor
and
du
pont
met
and
answer
their
organization
problem
early
be
that
in
and
their
operating
problem
be
large
and
more
complex
than
those
of
most
contemporary
american
industrial
enterprise
i
believe
it
be
also
true
that
we
recognize
the
problem
and
thought
more
in
term
of
organizational
principle
and
philosophy
than
do
most
businessmen
of
that
time
the
principle
of
organization
get
more
attention
among
us
than
they
do
then
in
the
university
if
what
follow
seem
academic
i
assure
you
that
we
do
not
think
it
so
i
write
the
organization
study
for
general
motor
as
a
possible
solution
for
the
specific
problem
create
by
the
expansion
of
the
corporation
after
world
war
i
i
cannot
of
course
say
for
sure
how
much
of
my
thought
on
management
come
from
contact
with
my
associate
idea
i
imagine
be
seldom
if
ever
wholly
original
but
so
far
as
i
be
aware
this
study
come
out
of
my
experience
in
hyatt
united
motor
and
general
motor
i
have
not
be
much
of
a
book
reader
and
if
i
have
be
i
understand
that
i
would
not
have
found
much
in
that
line
in
those
day
to
help
and
i
have
no
military
experience
in
the
course
of
my
twenty
year
or
so
at
hyatt
i
learn
to
operate
a
single
industrial
unit
relatively
small
in
size
and
with
one
basic
product
this
unit
contain
the
elementary
function
of
a
manufacturing
business
engineering
production
sale
and
finance
but
i
have
only
a
small
board
of
director
no
executive
committee
and
no
organization
problem
of
the
general
motor
type
in
united
motor
i
met
for
the
first
time
the
problem
of
operating
a
multiple
unit
organization
with
different
product
make
by
separate
division
all
that
held
united
motor
together
in
its
begin
be
the
concept
of
automotive
part
and
accessory
we
make
horn
radiator
bearing
rim
and
the
like
and
we
sell
them
to
both
automobile
producer
and
the
public
certain
limited
area
of
possible
coordination
present
themselves
for
example
the
service
of
the
numerous
small
product
make
by
the
different
division
separate
service
agency
for
such
small
item
be
uneconomic
i
therefore
set
up
a
single
nationwide
organization
call
united
motor
service
inc
on
october
to
represent
the
division
with
station
in
twenty
odd
large
city
and
several
hundred
dealer
at
other
point
the
division
naturally
resist
this
move
for
a
while
but
i
persuade
them
of
the
need
for
it
and
for
the
first
time
learn
something
about
get
decentralize
management
to
yield
some
of
its
function
for
the
common
good
the
service
organization
be
still
operating
in
general
motor
and
have
grown
along
with
the
business
as
a
whole
i
consider
set
up
a
common
laboratory
for
research
and
most
likely
would
have
do
so
if
we
have
not
enter
general
motor
i
do
establish
in
united
motor
a
unity
of
business
purpose
through
the
principle
of
return
on
investment
by
place
each
division
on
its
own
profit
make
basis
i
give
the
general
office
a
common
measure
of
efficiency
with
which
to
judge
the
contribution
of
each
division
to
the
whole
in
this
connection
i
devise
a
system
of
standard
accounting
which
albert
bradley
long
time
chief
financial
officer
of
general
motor
later
be
kind
enough
to
say
be
pretty
good
for
a
layman
in
the
great
expansion
in
general
motor
between
and
i
have
be
struck
by
the
disparity
between
substance
and
form
plenty
of
substance
and
little
form
i
become
convince
that
the
corporation
could
not
continue
to
grow
and
survive
unless
it
be
well
organize
and
it
be
apparent
that
no
one
be
give
that
subject
the
attention
it
need
an
example
close
to
home
for
me
when
the
united
motor
group
be
brought
into
the
general
motor
corporation
in
late
i
found
that
if
i
follow
the
prevail
practice
of
intercorporate
relation
i
would
no
longer
be
able
to
determine
the
rate
of
return
on
investment
for
these
accessory
division
individually
or
as
a
group
this
would
necessarily
mean
that
i
would
lose
some
degree
of
managerial
control
over
my
area
of
operation
at
that
time
material
within
general
motor
be
passing
from
one
operating
division
to
another
at
cost
or
at
cost
plus
some
predetermine
percentage
my
division
in
the
united
motor
corporation
have
sell
both
to
outside
customer
and
to
their
allied
division
at
the
market
price
i
knew
that
i
operate
a
profit
make
group
and
i
wish
to
continue
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
this
performance
to
the
general
management
rather
than
to
have
my
operating
result
on
interdivisional
business
swallow
up
in
the
extra
bookkeeping
profit
of
some
other
division
it
be
a
case
of
keep
the
information
clear
it
be
not
however
a
matter
of
interest
to
me
only
with
respect
to
my
division
since
as
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
i
be
a
kind
of
general
executive
and
so
have
begin
to
think
from
the
corporate
viewpoint
the
important
thing
be
that
no
one
knew
how
much
be
be
contribute
plus
or
minus
by
each
division
to
the
common
good
of
the
corporation
and
since
therefore
no
one
knew
or
could
prove
where
the
efficiency
and
inefficiency
lay
there
be
no
objective
basis
for
the
allocation
of
new
investment
this
be
one
of
the
difficulty
with
the
expansion
program
of
that
time
it
be
natural
for
the
division
to
compete
for
investment
fund
but
it
be
irrational
for
the
general
officer
of
the
corporation
not
to
know
where
to
place
the
money
to
best
advantage
in
the
absence
of
objectivity
it
be
not
surprising
that
there
be
a
lack
of
real
agreement
among
the
general
officer
furthermore
some
of
them
have
no
broad
outlook
and
use
their
membership
on
the
executive
committee
mainly
to
advance
the
interest
of
their
respective
division
i
have
take
up
the
question
of
interdivisional
relation
with
mr
durant
before
i
enter
general
motor
and
my
view
on
it
be
well
enough
know
for
me
to
be
appoint
chairman
of
a
committee
to
formulate
rule
and
regulation
pertain
to
inter
divisional
business
on
december
i
complete
the
report
by
the
follow
summer
and
present
it
to
the
executive
committee
on
december
i
select
here
a
few
of
its
first
principle
which
though
they
be
an
accepted
part
of
management
doctrine
today
be
not
so
well
know
then
i
think
they
be
still
worth
attention
i
state
the
basic
argument
as
follow
the
profit
result
from
any
business
consider
abstractly
be
no
real
measure
of
the
merit
of
that
particular
business
an
operation
make
per
year
may
be
a
very
profitable
business
justify
expansion
and
the
use
of
all
the
additional
capital
that
it
can
profitably
employ
on
the
other
hand
a
business
make
a
year
may
be
a
very
unprofitable
one
not
only
not
justify
far
expansion
but
even
justify
liquidation
unless
more
profitable
return
can
be
obtain
it
be
not
therefore
a
matter
of
the
amount
of
profit
but
of
the
relation
of
that
profit
to
the
real
worth
of
invest
capital
within
the
business
unless
that
principle
be
fully
recognize
in
any
plan
that
may
be
adopt
illogical
and
unsound
result
and
statistic
be
unavoidable
there
seem
to
me
still
to
be
no
question
about
that
it
be
as
i
see
it
the
strategic
aim
of
a
business
to
earn
a
return
on
capital
and
if
in
any
particular
case
the
return
in
the
long
run
be
not
satisfactory
the
deficiency
should
be
correct
or
the
activity
abandon
for
a
more
favorable
one
for
sale
to
outside
customer
i
recognize
in
the
report
that
the
market
would
determine
the
actual
price
and
if
this
yield
a
desirable
return
the
business
in
question
might
justify
expansion
for
exclusively
interdivisional
transaction
i
recommend
that
the
start
point
should
be
cost
plus
some
predetermine
rate
of
return
but
only
as
a
guide
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
protect
a
supply
division
which
might
be
a
high
cost
producer
i
recommend
a
number
of
step
involve
analysis
of
the
operation
and
comparison
with
outside
competitive
production
where
possible
the
point
i
wish
to
make
here
relates
not
to
technique
which
other
people
know
well
than
i
do
but
to
the
general
principle
of
rate
of
return
as
the
measure
of
the
worth
of
a
business
that
idea
be
fundamental
in
my
think
about
management
problem
on
the
influence
of
rate
of
return
on
decentralization
and
the
relation
of
the
part
to
the
whole
i
make
several
point
of
which
the
follow
seem
to
me
to
be
of
interest
as
to
its
bearing
on
organization
it
increase
the
morale
of
the
organization
by
place
each
operation
on
its
own
foundation
make
it
feel
that
it
be
a
part
of
the
corporation
assume
its
own
responsibility
and
contribute
its
share
to
the
final
result
as
to
its
bearing
on
financial
control
it
develops
statistic
correctly
reflect
the
relation
between
the
net
return
and
the
invest
capital
of
each
operating
division
the
true
measure
of
efficiency
irrespective
of
the
number
of
other
division
contribute
thereto
and
the
capital
employ
within
such
division
as
to
its
bearing
on
strategic
investment
it
enables
the
corporation
to
direct
the
place
of
additional
capital
where
it
will
result
in
the
great
benefit
to
the
corporation
as
a
whole
so
far
as
i
know
this
be
the
first
write
statement
of
the
broad
principle
of
financial
control
in
general
motor
i
continued
thereafter
to
occupy
myself
with
the
subject
of
organization
in
the
late
summer
of
i
have
go
abroad
with
a
group
of
general
motor
executive
to
study
the
overseas
prospect
of
the
corporation
in
the
group
be
mr
haskell
its
chairman
mr
kettering
mr
mott
mr
chrysler
albert
champion
and
alfred
t
brandt
who
act
as
secretary
on
our
way
over
on
the
s
s
france
we
held
regular
meeting
on
overseas
matter
and
at
other
time
met
and
discuss
problem
of
organization
i
can
recall
that
we
have
such
conversation
but
i
cannot
recall
what
be
say
mr
haskell
it
appear
regard
them
as
be
of
some
importance
at
the
time
at
the
end
of
a
letter
to
mr
durant
on
october
shortly
after
we
return
to
the
united
state
he
write
the
follow
we
start
work
on
organization
matter
the
day
we
left
new
york
and
the
entire
committee
participate
in
conference
which
result
in
an
agreement
and
a
report
be
be
prepared
which
we
believe
will
be
workable
and
help
to
lighten
all
of
our
burden
however
these
matter
can
best
be
dealt
with
personally
rather
than
in
a
perhaps
already
too
long
communication
i
do
not
know
what
mr
haskell
meant
by
say
that
we
agree
other
than
perhaps
on
the
need
for
well
organization
my
recollection
be
that
there
be
more
disagreement
than
agreement
nor
do
i
know
of
any
report
on
organization
that
come
out
of
these
discussion
it
be
a
long
time
to
go
back
in
memory
and
find
the
precise
time
and
place
of
thing
especially
when
their
importance
be
not
realize
at
the
time
i
have
institute
search
to
verify
or
correct
my
memory
on
origin
i
find
for
example
that
during
the
year
as
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
i
along
with
others
perform
a
number
of
task
concerned
with
organization
and
in
connection
with
them
developed
in
a
rudimentary
way
some
of
the
idea
that
i
write
up
in
my
general
organization
study
one
of
these
task
be
the
study
of
interdivisional
business
discuss
above
another
be
the
study
of
appropriation
request
rule
which
be
discuss
in
a
later
chapter
in
the
midst
of
this
welter
of
thought
and
attempt
action
and
a
half
year
before
the
actual
economic
and
management
crisis
begin
i
draft
the
organization
study
and
circulate
it
unofficially
it
become
a
kind
of
best
seller
in
the
corporation
all
during
i
receive
numerous
letter
from
executive
request
copy
of
it
so
many
in
fact
that
i
found
it
necessary
to
reproduce
it
in
quantity
it
have
no
competition
that
be
no
other
tangible
effort
be
make
so
far
as
i
know
to
achieve
a
general
solution
of
the
organization
problem
in
september
i
sent
a
copy
of
the
study
to
pierre
s
du
pont
then
chairman
of
the
corporation
we
have
an
exchange
about
it
i
write
my
dear
mr
dupont
refer
to
our
conversation
the
other
day
i
be
enclose
herewith
copy
of
organization
study
work
out
about
a
year
ago
i
have
review
this
in
the
light
of
development
since
then
and
a
great
insight
in
the
work
of
our
organization
and
i
do
not
see
as
i
would
recommend
any
radical
change
except
in
reference
to
the
additional
recommendation
which
i
would
not
make
as
i
view
the
situation
now
if
you
have
time
to
read
this
study
at
all
please
bear
in
mind
that
it
be
work
out
on
a
basis
of
what
i
thought
would
be
acceptable
to
all
interest
rather
than
what
would
form
an
ideal
organization
if
it
be
to
be
work
out
along
the
latter
line
i
should
be
in
favor
of
ultimately
appoint
an
executive
in
charge
of
the
three
group
list
on
page
the
miscellaneous
group
other
than
the
export
corporation
and
the
acceptance
corporation
ultimately
passing
into
one
of
the
other
three
group
this
would
reduce
the
number
of
executive
reporting
directly
to
the
president
to
five
thus
give
the
president
time
to
study
into
the
broader
problem
mr
du
pont
reply
dear
mr
sloan
i
be
glad
that
you
follow
up
our
conversation
with
a
copy
of
your
study
of
a
year
ago
at
the
first
opportunity
i
shall
read
this
carefully
and
hope
for
another
discussion
on
the
subject
with
you
at
the
end
of
november
when
mr
durant
go
out
and
mr
du
pont
become
president
the
new
administration
need
a
scheme
of
organization
immediately
mr
durant
have
be
able
to
operate
the
corporation
in
his
own
way
as
the
say
go
by
the
seat
of
his
pant
the
new
administration
be
make
up
of
men
with
very
different
idea
about
business
administration
they
desire
a
highly
rational
and
objective
mode
of
operation
the
organization
study
serve
the
purpose
and
as
i
have
related
it
be
officially
adopt
with
some
revision
as
basic
corporation
policy
the
study
be
primitive
by
comparison
with
present
day
knowledge
of
management
and
it
be
write
from
the
point
of
view
of
present
something
that
i
thought
would
be
acceptable
to
mr
durant
so
it
be
not
without
constraint
it
begin
as
follow
the
object
of
this
study
be
to
suggest
an
organization
for
the
general
motor
corporation
which
will
definitely
place
the
line
of
authority
throughout
its
extensive
operation
as
well
as
to
coordinate
each
branch
of
its
service
at
the
same
time
destroy
none
of
the
effectiveness
with
which
its
work
have
heretofore
be
conduct
the
basis
upon
which
this
study
have
be
make
be
found
upon
two
principle
which
be
state
as
follow
the
responsibility
attach
to
the
chief
executive
of
each
operation
shall
in
no
way
be
limited
each
such
organization
head
by
its
chief
executive
shall
be
complete
in
every
necessary
function
and
enable
d
to
exercise
its
full
initiative
and
logical
development
certain
central
organization
function
be
absolutely
essential
to
the
logical
development
and
proper
control
of
the
corporation
s
activity
this
do
not
need
much
interpretation
it
asks
first
for
a
line
of
authority
coordination
and
the
retention
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
then
prevail
total
decentralization
but
look
back
on
the
text
of
the
two
basic
principle
after
all
these
year
i
be
amuse
to
see
that
the
language
be
contradictory
and
that
its
very
contradiction
be
the
crux
of
the
matter
in
point
i
maximize
decentralization
of
divisional
operation
in
the
word
shall
in
no
way
be
limited
in
point
i
proceed
to
limit
the
responsibility
of
divisional
chief
executive
in
the
expression
proper
control
the
language
of
organization
have
always
suffer
some
want
of
word
to
express
the
true
fact
and
circumstance
of
human
interaction
one
usually
asserts
one
aspect
or
another
of
it
at
different
time
such
as
the
absolute
independence
of
the
part
and
again
the
need
of
coordination
and
again
the
concept
of
the
whole
with
a
guide
center
interaction
however
be
the
thing
and
with
some
reservation
about
the
language
and
detail
i
still
stand
on
the
fundamental
of
what
i
write
in
the
study
its
basic
principle
be
in
touch
with
the
central
problem
of
management
as
i
have
know
it
to
this
day
the
next
point
in
the
study
be
how
to
carry
this
philosophy
into
action
i
write
have
establish
the
above
principle
as
fundamental
and
it
be
believe
that
all
interest
within
the
corporation
agree
as
to
such
principle
the
definite
object
which
it
be
hop
to
attain
by
this
study
be
enumerate
as
follow
to
definitely
determine
the
function
of
the
various
division
constitute
the
corporation
s
activity
not
only
in
relation
to
one
another
but
in
relation
to
the
central
organization
that
be
a
big
chew
but
it
be
correct
if
you
can
describe
the
function
of
the
part
and
the
whole
you
have
laid
out
a
complete
work
organization
for
by
implication
the
apportionment
of
responsibility
for
decision
at
various
level
be
contain
in
the
description
i
continued
with
the
second
objective
to
determine
the
status
of
the
central
organization
and
to
coordinate
the
operation
of
that
central
organization
with
the
corporation
as
a
whole
to
the
end
that
it
will
perform
its
necessary
and
logical
place
this
be
a
restatement
of
the
first
point
but
in
reverse
that
be
look
from
the
top
down
the
third
objective
to
centralize
the
control
of
all
the
executive
function
of
the
corporation
in
the
president
as
its
chief
executive
officer
decentralization
or
not
an
industrial
corporation
be
not
the
mild
form
of
organization
in
society
i
never
minimize
the
administrative
power
of
the
chief
executive
officer
in
principle
when
i
occupy
that
position
i
simply
exercise
that
power
with
discretion
i
get
well
result
by
sell
my
idea
than
by
tell
people
what
to
do
yet
the
power
to
act
must
be
locate
in
the
chief
executive
officer
the
fourth
and
fifth
point
speak
for
themselves
to
limit
as
far
as
practical
the
number
of
executive
reporting
directly
to
the
president
the
object
be
to
enable
the
president
to
well
guide
the
broad
policy
of
the
corporation
without
come
in
contact
with
problem
that
may
safely
be
entrust
to
executive
of
less
importance
to
provide
mean
within
each
executive
branch
whereby
all
other
executive
branch
be
represent
in
an
advisory
way
to
the
end
that
the
development
of
each
branch
will
be
along
line
constructive
to
the
corporation
as
a
whole
in
brief
the
study
present
a
specific
structure
for
the
corporation
as
it
exist
at
that
time
it
recognize
the
form
of
the
division
each
of
which
be
a
self
contain
group
of
function
engineering
production
sale
and
the
like
it
grouped
the
division
accord
to
like
activity
and
as
i
say
in
my
letter
to
mr
du
pont
propose
to
place
an
executive
in
charge
of
each
group
the
plan
provide
for
advisory
staff
which
would
be
without
line
authority
it
provide
for
a
financial
staff
it
distinguish
policy
from
administration
of
policy
and
specify
the
location
of
each
in
the
structure
it
express
in
its
way
the
concept
that
be
later
to
be
formulate
as
decentralize
operation
with
coordinate
control
the
principle
of
organization
in
the
study
thus
initiate
for
the
modern
general
motor
the
trend
toward
a
happy
medium
in
industrial
organization
between
the
extreme
of
pure
centralization
and
pure
decentralization
the
new
policy
ask
that
the
corporation
neither
remain
as
it
be
a
weak
form
of
organization
nor
become
a
rigid
command
form
but
the
actual
form
of
organization
that
be
to
evolve
in
the
future
under
a
new
administration
what
exactly
for
example
would
remain
a
divisional
responsibility
and
what
would
be
coordinate
and
what
would
be
policy
and
what
would
be
administration
could
not
be
deduce
by
a
process
of
logic
from
the
organization
study
even
mistake
played
a
large
part
in
the
actual
event
as
i
shall
show
and
if
our
competitor
mr
ford
among
them
have
not
make
some
of
their
own
of
considerable
magnitude
and
if
we
have
not
reverse
certain
of
ours
the
position
of
general
motor
would
be
different
from
what
it
be
today
although
the
plan
be
officially
adopt
in
expediency
be
for
some
time
to
rule
the
corporation
the
formation
of
the
new
executive
committee
be
the
first
outstanding
example
of
this
its
four
member
who
be
charge
with
the
guidance
of
the
corporation
have
never
before
have
the
responsibility
of
produce
an
automobile
the
great
automotive
producer
in
general
motor
have
be
mr
durant
mr
nash
and
mr
chrysler
they
have
already
by
make
their
mark
in
the
leadership
of
the
automobile
industry
and
owe
to
the
turn
of
fortune
which
i
have
described
they
be
then
or
be
about
to
be
numbered
among
our
competitor
mr
durant
soon
after
leave
general
motor
form
another
company
durant
motor
which
in
its
time
be
to
produce
several
car

his
first
five
year
as

left
the

end
of
the

briefly
to
mr

thereafter
to
mr

mr

be
a
financial
man
mr
haskell
s
contact
with
the
business
be
brief
and
not
directly
in
divisional
operation
and
he
soon
drop
out
of
intimate
participation
in
the
new
operating
responsibility
he
die
on
september
i
come
near
to
have
automotive
experience
and
though
i
have
spent
my
life
in
the
industry
i
be
still
undeveloped
in
car
operation
so
we
be
four
amateur
so
to
speak
in
comparison
with
mr
nash
mr
chrysler
and
mr
durant
soon
on
the
active
end
we
be
three
and
since
mr
raskob
be
in
finance
the
high
responsibility
for
operating
the
corporation
fell
upon
two
of
us
mr
du
pont
and
myself
as
his
principal
assistant
mr
du
pont
and
i
work
closely
together
travel
together
and
met
with
operating
executive
in
detroit
every
two
week
after
six
month
i
become
a
sort
of
executive
vice
president
in
charge
of
all
operation
reporting
to
mr
du
pont
but
there
be
no
straight
and
clear
line
in
this
matter
at
one
point
for
example
mr
du
pont
add
to
his
burden
and
to
the
complexity
of
the
improvised
management
by
cause
himself
to
be
appoint
general
manager
of
chevrolet
along
with
his
chairmanship
and
presidency
of
the
corporation
if
we
lack
experience
in
operation
we
do
not
lack
energy
in
overcome
this
deficiency
the
executive
committee
work
without
respite
throughout
we
met
during
that
year
exactly
time
in
formal
session
between
session
individually
and
together
we
be
absorbed
in
the
innumerable
problem
of
the
emergency
and
of
the
future
and
be
constantly
on
the
go
visit
the
division
and
their
plant
in
detroit
flint
dayton
and
elsewhere
and
so
if
i
be
to
take
stock
of
the
situation
as
it
stood
three
or
four
month
after
the
change
of
administration
i
would
say
that
although
we
be
short
on
experience
we
be
long
on
logic
and
energy
and
we
be
get
control
of
the
runaway
element
of
the
business
particularly
the
inventory
furthermore
we
recognize
that
general
motor
have
no
explicit
policy
as
to
the
line
of
car
to
be

its

after
the

great

to
perhaps
one
should
say
because
of
them
general
motor
be
in
need
not
only
of
a
concept
of
management
but
equally
of
a
concept
of
the
automobile
business
every
enterprise
need
a
concept
of
its
industry
there
be
a
logical
way
of
do
business
in

with
the
fact
and
circumstance
of
an
industry
if
you
can
figure
it
out
if
there
be
different

among
the

involve
these
concept
be
likely
to
express
competitive
force
in
their
most
vigorous
and
most
decisive
form
such
be
the
case
in
the
automobile
industry
in
mr

concept
of
a
static

at

in
the

express
in

then
as
it

for
more

a

other

the

out

more

it

observe

that
no

the

as

the

to
my
mind
without
any
justification
neither

have
its

the
sheridan
assemble
in

then
no

both
have
only
modest
dealer

together
they
add
nothing

excess

why
then

they

stock
have
come
into

with
the
acquisition
of

the
car
have
not
developed
important
volume
about
in
and
the
same
in
and
have
no
reasonable
place
in
general
motor
line
the
presence
of
the
sheridan
be
a
mystery
to
me
mr

cause
general
motor
to
acquire
it
in
doubtless
with
something
special
in
mind
i
be
uncertain
what
it
do
not
have
a
strong
organization
or
demand
or
recognizable
purpose
in
our
line
as
for
oakland
and
old
not
only
be
they
compete
at
nearly
identical
price
but
both
of
them
be
grow
rapidly
obsolescent
in
design
take
the
oakland
at
a
meeting
in
my
office
on
february
mr
pratt
described
the
problem
of
this
car
as
follow
oakland
be
spending
its
effort
in
try
to
improve
its
product
some
day
they
produce
ten
car
and
some
day
they
produce
car
the
situation
be
this
they
turn
out
a
lot
of
car
that
be
not
what
they
should
be
and
then
they
have
to
fix
them
up
the
power
plant
have
be
the
great
trouble
at
the
same
meeting
i
say
there
be
a
lot
that
enters
into
this
problem
at
the
present
time
we
be
get
to
h
p
out
of
the
oakland
motor
and
the
crankshaft
be
too
light
for
this
rate
of
speed
power
and
we
have
have
a
lot
of
poor
workmanship
together
with
other
thing
and
the
oakland
motor
car
company
over
a
year
ago
decide
that
they
would
put
in
a
new
motor
a
new
motor
plant
be
authorize
a
year
ago
but
we
have
to
hold
it
up
when
we
curtail
our
development
program
it
be
really
a
question
of
management
to
get
this
motor
in
the
oakland
so
it
will
pas
inspection
and
be
right
oakland
have
sell
its
high
of
car
in
the
boom
year
it
sell
in
and
as
it
turn
out
be
to
sell
only
car
in
so
much
for
oakland
old
be
only
a
little
well
off
it
have
sell
vehicle
in
in
and
would
sell
in
it
would
take
a
new
design
just
to
save
it
cadillac
make
unit
sale
in
in
it
would
sell
and
with
the
big
price
deflation
that
have
take
place
in
the
united
state
it
would
have
to
find
a
new
optimum
of
cost
price
and
volume
the
hard
fact
be
that
all
the
car
in
the
general
motor
line
except
buick
and
cadillac
be
lose
money
in
the
chevrolet
division
that
year
lose
about
half
of
its
volume
its
dollar
loss
at
one
point
in
reach
approximately
million
a
month
and
for
the
year
as
a
whole
it
lose
nearly
million
so
strongly
do
i
feel
about
the
situation
that
when
someone
propose
make
change
in
buick
s
management
where
harry
bassett
be
successfully
carry
on
walter
chrysler
s
old
policy
i
write
to
mr
du
pont
it
be
far
well
that
the
rest
of
general
motor
be
scrap
than
any
chance
take
with
buick
s
earn
power
if
that
seem
like
an
overextend
argument
consider
buick
s
position
its
sale
drop
only
moderately
from
in
the
boom
to
in
the
slump
and
what
s
more
it
continued
to
produce
an
income
it
be
buick
that
make
any
kind
of
general
motor
car
line
worth
talk
about
this
situation
reflect
in
good
part
the
poor
quality
and
unreliability
of
the
other
car
in
the
line
as
compare
with
the
high
quality
and
reliability
of
buick
and
cadillac
the
effect
of
these
factor
be
intensified
by
the
stress
of
the
general
economic
slump
give
the
fact
of
the
slump
and
the
unavoidability
of
a
general
decline
in
sale
the
relative
decline
of
one
division
as
compare
with
another
be
a
question
of

the

have
the

of
show
up
all
kind
of
weakness

mr

no

dare
seriously
to
challenge
in

since
be
tighten
his

we

as
in
the

of

all
in

no

we

it

clear
that
we
need
an
idea
for
penetrate
the
low
price
field
and
for
the
deployment
of
the
car
through
the
line
as
a
whole
and
we
need
a
research
and
development
policy
a
sale
policy
and
the
like
to
support
whatever
we
do
in
view
of
these
circumstance
it
be
hardly
surprising
that
on
april
the
executive
committee
set
up
a
special
committee
of
the
advisory
staff
make
up
of
experienced
automobile
men
in
management
to
look
into
our
product

this
task
be
to
be
one
of
the
most
significant
in
the
evolution
of
the

the

later
we
have
complete
our
study
and
on

th
i
present
our
recommendation
to
the
executive
committee
where
they
be
approve
and
become
the
adopt
policy
of
the
corporation
the
recommendation
outline
the
basic
product
policy
of
the
corporation
a
market
strategy
and
some
first
principle
all
together
they
express
the
concept
of
the
business
the
general
historical
circumstance
described
above
have
much
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
recommendation
and
there
be
other
circumstance
in
the
internal
situation
in
general
motor
which
influence
what
we
have
to
say
in
the
first
place
the
executive
committee
have
instruct
the
special
committee
that
the
corporation
intend
to
enter
the
low
price
field
that
be
that
it
intend
to
make
a
competitive
challenge
to
the
dominance
of
ford
the
executive
committee
ask
the
special
committee
for
advice
on
this
question
and
suggest
that
car
be
design
and
built
in
two
low
price
range
the
low
of
which
would
compete
with
ford
they
also
ask
for
a
discussion
at
some
later
time
of
other
price
area
they
exclude
however
any
change
in
the
successfully
establish
position
of
buick
and
cadillac
the
seed
of
a
great
controversy
in
the
corporation
have
be
sown
a
few
week
earlier
when
the
executive
committee
lead
by
pierre
s
du
pont
decide
that
the
corporation
should
make
its
entrance
into
the
low
price
field
with
a
new
and
revolutionary
kind
of
car
discuss
in
detail
in
the
next
chapter
this
car
appear
to
have
excite
new
potentiality
but
i
have
some
reservation
about
our
ability
to
solve
all
the
engineering
problem
it
raise
indeed
a
paramount
reason
for
make
a
product
policy
explicit
from
my
point
of
view
be
to
bring
the
automobile
men
into
the
discussion
other
immediate
circumstance
also
have
a
bearing
on
that
discussion
among
them
an
impend
shakeout
of
the
division
form
the
old
car
line
and
a
need
we
all
felt
for
ground
rule
that
be
for
first
principle
that
would
be
acceptable
to
all
in
debate
and
in
order
that
the
new
product
policy
should
be
consider
not
just
alone
but
in
its
essential
relation
to
the
overall
objective
of
the
corporation
we
undertook
to
draw
the
whole
picture
and
put
all
the
know
piece
into
it
thus
the
new
management
take
the
opportunity
that
come
rarely
in
the
initial
stage
of
a
business
to
stand
back
and
review
aim
and
deal
with
the
matter
at
hand
both
in
particular
and
with
a
considerable
degree
of
generalization
it
be
not
go
to
be
easy
to
get
willing
agreement
on
specific
and
immediate
issue
for
example
the
idea
of
the
revolutionary
car
be
very
much
entrench
in
the
executive
committee
and
i
want
to
broaden
the
concept
of
the
product
to
the
concept
of
the
business
i
believe
it
be
for
this
reason
that
we
on
the
special
committee
first
idealize
the
problem
we
start
not
with
the
actual
corporation
but
with
a
model
of
a
corporation
for
which
we
say
we
would
state
policy
standard
our
aim
we
say
be
to
chart
the
true
best
course
for
the
future
operation
of
this
model
corporation
recognize
that
present
actual
condition
necessitate
sail
off
the
recommend
course
temporarily
until
it
become
practicable
to
put
any
adopt
policy
standard
into
full
effect
to
this
end
we
make
the
assumption
of
the
business
process
itself
explicit
we
presume
that
the
first
purpose
in
make
a
capital
investment
be
the
establishment
of
a
business
that
will
both
pay
satisfactory
dividend
and
preserve
and
increase
its
capital
value
the
primary
object
of
the
corporation
therefore
we
declare
be
to
make
money
not
just
to
make
motor
car
positive
statement
like
this
have
a
flavor
that
have
go
out
of
fashion
but
i
still
think
that
the
abc
s
of
business
have
merit
for
reach
policy
conclusion
general
motor
have
collect
a
number
of
profitless
motor
car
since
and
a
few
be
still
be
produce
the
problem
be
to
design
a
product
line
that
would
make
money
the
future
of
the
corporation
and
its
earn
power
we
assert
depend
upon
its
ability
to
design
and
produce
car
of
maximum
utility
value
in
quantity
at
minimum
cost
you
can
t
really
simultaneously
maximize
utility
and
minimize
cost
but
it
be
a
manner
of
speak
for
what
nowadays
we
refer
to
more
precisely
as
the
optimize
of
conflict
function
to
raise
the
utility
and
low
the
cost
of
our
car
one
of
our
first
conclusion
be
that
the
number
of
model
and
the
duplication
that
then
exist
within
the
corporation
should
be
limited
by
such
economize
which
have
take
various
form
through
the
year
the
corporation
i
believe
have
render
the
service
to
the
public
that
all
must
give
in
the
long
run
to
succeed
in
business
the
prevail
concept
in
the
executive
committee
be
to
meet
ford
more
or
less
head
on
with
a
revolutionary
car
design
certainly
ford
look
unbeatable
by
any
ordinary
mean
there
may
also
have
be
opinion
among
some
in
the
corporation
that
to
enter
the
low
price
precinct
on
any
basis
would
waste
the
resource
we
have
gain
elsewhere
in
any
case
we
have
give
to
us
in
our
directive
a
volume
product
policy
namely
to
sell
car
in
the
low
price
area
where
there
be
buyer
the
real
question
for
the
special
committee
be
how
to
do
it
our
answer
be
to
accept
the
concept
of
a
new
car
design
but
to
place
it
in
the
perspective
of
a
broad
product
policy
the
product
policy
we
propose
be
the
one
for
which
general
motor
have
now
long
be
know
we
say
first
that
the
corporation
should
produce
a
line
of
car
in
each
price
area
from
the
low
price
up
to
one
for
a
strictly
high
grade
quantity
production
car
but
we
would
not
get
into
the
fancy
price
field
with
small
production
second
that
the
price
step
should
not
be
such
as
to
leave
wide
gap
in
the
line
and
yet
should
be
great
enough
to
keep
their
number
within
reason
so
that
the
great
advantage
of
quantity
production
could
be
secure
and
third
that
there
should
be
no
duplication
by
the
corporation
in
the
price
field
or
step
these
new
policy
never
materialize
precisely
in
this
form
for
example
we
always
have
have
in
fact
duplication
and
competition
between
the
division
yet
essentially
the
new
product
policy
differentiate
the
new
general
motor
from
the
old
and
the
new
general
motor
from
the
ford
organization
of
the
time
and
from
other
car
manufacturer
naturally
we
thought
that
this
policy
be
superior
to
compete
policy
in
the
industry
and
would
win
over
them
again
let
me
say
that
company
compete
in
broad
policy
as
well
as
in
specific
product
in
the
perspective
of
so
many
year
go
by
the
idea
of
this
policy
seem
pretty
simple
like
a
shoe
manufacturer
propose
to
sell
shoe
in
more
than
one
size
but
it
certainly
do
not
seem
simple
at
the
time
when
ford
have
more
than
half
the
market
with
two
grade
the
high
volume
low
price
model
t
and
the
low
volume
high
price
lincoln
and
dodge
willys
maxwell
chrysler
hudson
studebaker
nash
and
others
have
substantial
position
in
the
industry
and
be
make
or
prepare
powerful
bid
with
other
product
policy
for
all
we
knew
then
our
policy
might
not
have
work
best
if
the
industry
have
thought
it
would
work
the
others
would
have
adopt
it
at
the
time
the
same
policy
be
available
to
all
but
for
a
number
of
year
general
motor
alone
be
to
pursue
it
and
prove
its
worthiness
in
draw
the
whole
picture
of
the
policy
we
integrate
into
it
other
possible
valid
criterion
possible
that
be
in
the
sense
that
they
might
be
use
as
individual
criterion
for
example
the
policy
we
say
be
valid
if
our
car
be
at
least
equal
in
design
to
the
best
of
our
competitor
in
a
grade
so
that
it
be
not
necessary
to
lead
in
design
or
run
the
risk
of
untried
experiment
certainly
i
prefer
this
concept
to
an
irrevocable
commitment
to
replace
the
then
standard
chevrolet
with
a
revolutionary
car
such
a
car
would
be
fine
if
it
work
but
i
prefer
to
rest
first
on
a
broad
business
strategy
and
as
the
policy
be
adopt
it
be
evident
that
pierre
s
du
pont
also
subscribed
to
the
general
concept
at
least
in
principle
we
of
the
special
committee
of
course
acknowledge
that
general
motor
automobile
could
reasonably
be
expect
to
be
make
preeminent
in
all
grade
we
argue
that
the
breadth
of
the
car
line
would
give
us
this
capability
though
of
course
our
then
percent
of
the
market
give
us
no
particular
advantage
in
this
respect
we
figure
that
in
product
line
and
in
quality
standard
we
be
or
could
become
as
good
as
anybody
in
whatever
they
be
good
at
and
well
at
what
they
be
not
good
at
the
same
idea
held
for
production
where
of
course
we
have
to
have
ford
in
mind
we
point
out
that
it
be
not
essential
that
for
any
particular
car
production
be
more
efficient
than
that
of
its
best
competitor
or
for
that
matter
that
the
advertising
sell
and
service
method
in
any
particular
product
be
well
than
its
competitor
the
fundamental
conception
of
the
advantage
to
be
secure
in
this
business
we
say
be
express
by
cooperation
and
coordination
of
our
various
policy
and
division
it
be
natural
to
expect
that
coordinate
operation
of
our
plant
should
result
in
great
efficiency
than
be
the
case
when
the
division
be
work
at
cross
purpose
and
the
same
could
be
say
for
engineering
and
other
function
by
raise
our
own
standard
in
this
way
we
could
reasonably
expect
to
equal
the
best
in
any
respect
that
our
competition
in
any
grade
have
to
offer
and
to
exceed
it
in
some
respect
under
a
plan
of
cooperation
the
teamwork
could
thus
attain
increase
volume
at
reduce
cost
and
so
at
a
time
when
we
sell
only
a
small
proportion
of
all
u
s
car
and
truck
we
nonetheless
believe
that
with
a
federate
policy
in
a
business
of
wide
scope
general
motor
car
in
the
future
would
be
make
pre
eminent
in
engineering
in
all
grade
and
could
similarly
achieve
unquestioned
leadership
in
production
advertising
sell
and
other
function
have
set
forth
these
concept
we
then
approve
the
resolution
of
the
executive
committee
which
have
be
pass
on
to
us
to
study
to
the
effect
that
a
car
should
be
design
and
built
to
sell
for
not
more
than
and
that
another
car
should
be
design
and
built
to
sell
for
not
more
than
the
special
committee
far
recommend
four
additional
model
each
to
be
kept
strictly
within
the
price
range
specify
it
also
recommend
that
the
policy
of
the
corporation
should
be
to
produce
and
market
only
six
standard
model
and
that
as
soon
as
practicable
the
follow
grade
should
constitute
the
entire
line
of
car

brand

hypothetical

structure
when
compare
with
general
motor
actual
price
bracket
list
earlier
in
this
chapter
will
be
see
to
reduce
the
car
line
from
seven
to
six
or
ten
to
six
car
if
the
chevrolet
fb
and
the
old
and
be
consider
separate
car
as
they
pretty
much
be
it
open
up
one
new
classification
on
the
low
end
of
the
list
where
we
have
none
and
where
we
have
eight
car
in
the
middle
above
the
low
price
and
below
the
high
we
now
have
only
four
classification
the
new
set
of
price
class
meant
that
the
general
motor
car
line
should
be
integral
that
each
car
in
the
line
should
properly
be
conceive
in
its
relationship
to
the
line
as
a
whole
have
thus
separate
out
a
set
of
related
price
class
we
set
forth
an
intricate
strategy
which
can
be
summarize
as
follow
we
propose
in
general
that
general
motor
should
place
its
car
at
the
top
of
each
price
range
and
make
them
of
such
a
quality
that
they
would
attract
sale
from
below
that
price
sell
to
those
customer
who
might
be
willing
to
pay
a
little
more
for
the
additional
quality
and
attract
sale
also
from
above
that
price
sell
to
those
customer
who
would
see
the
price
advantage
in
a
car
of
close
to
the
quality
of
high
price
competition
this
amount
to
quality
competition
against
car
below
a
give
price
tag
and
price
competition
against
car
above
that
price
tag
of
course
a
competitor
could
respond
in
kind
but
where
we
have
little
volume
we
could
thereby
chip
away
an
increase
from
above
and
below
and
where
we
have
volume
it
be
up
to
us
to
maintain
it
unless
the
number
of
model
be
limited
we
say
and
unless
it
be
plan
that
each
model
should
cover
its
own
grade
and
also
overlap
into
the
grade
above
and
below
its
price
a
large
volume
could
not
be
secure
for
each
car
this
large
volume
we
observe
be
necessary
to
gain
the
advantage
of
quantity
production
count
on
as
a
most
important
factor
in
earn
a
position
of
pre
eminence
in
all
the
grade
the
product
policy
also
take
up
specifically
the
problem
of
penetrate
the
low
price
field
a
special
case
of
the
general
concept
the
field
for
car
of
the
first
grade
we
note
be
then
practically
monopolize
by
the
ford
and
we
be
try
to
invade
it
we
recommend
that
general
motor
should
not
attempt
to
build
and
sell
a
car
of
the
precise
ford
level
as
the
ford
sell
at
the
low
price
within
the
first
grade
instead
the
corporation
should
market
a
car
much
well
than
the
ford
with
a
view
to
sell
it
at
or
near
the
top
price
in
the
first
grade
we
do
not
propose
to
compete
head
on
with
the
ford
grade
but
to
produce
a
car
that
would
be
superior
to
the
ford
yet
so
near
the
ford
price
that
demand
would
be
drawn
from
the
ford
grade
and
lift
to
the
slightly
high
price
in
preference
to
ford
s
then
utility
design
we
observe
that
the
converse
of
this
effect
would
be
produce
when
the
new
general
motor
low
price
car
sell
at
the
top
of
the
low
price
range
in
the
table
be
compare
with
car
of
competitor
in
the
next
high
grade
sell
at
or
slightly
below
even
though
the
new
general
motor
low
price
car
might
not
have
quite
the
quality
of
compete
car
sell
at
approximately
it
should
be
so
near
the
grade
of
compete
car
sell
at
the
middle
of
the
second
price
range
that
prospective
buyer
would
prefer
to
save
and
to
yield
the
comparatively
slight
preference
they
might
have
for
the
compete
car
if
the
price
be
nearly
equal
the
specific
competitive
aim
of
the
new
product
policy
at
that
time
be
evident
in
the
low
price
classification
set
up
for
the
model
corporation
in
this
classification
general
motor
do
not
have
a
car
to
offer
in
april
the
only
car
available
in
this
area
be
the
ford
furthermore
in
the
second
low
classification
only
chevrolet
and
willys
overland
offer
a
car
thus
the
policy
be
direct
at
supply
a
car
to
be
put
into
competition
solely
with
the
chief
product
of
the
then
lead
car
manufacturer
in
the
united
state
and
the
world
as
it
happen
actual
car
price
in
all
category
fell
rapidly
in
collapse
the
whole
price
structure
that
exist
in
the
market
in
april
when
we
formulate
the
policy
but
while
actual
level
become
different
the
aim
of
the
policy
remain
the
same
namely
to
move
into
the
relatively
low
price
area
indeed
by
september
the
price
of
the
chevrolet
tour
car
be
down
from
january
price
to
while
the
ford
model
t
be
down
from
to
but
the
ford
price
do
not
include
demountable
rim
and
self
starter
as
chevrolet
do
so
that
on
a
comparable
equipment
basis
there
be
in
september
only
about
difference
between
ford
and
chevrolet
this
difference
be
still
relatively
considerable
but
the
chevrolet
be
begin
to
move
in
the
direction
indicate
in
the
product
policy
thus
this
policy
by
opening
up
new
low
price
area
foreshadow
the
challenge
that
general
motor
be
actually
to
make
to
the
dominance
of
ford
the
placement
of
actual
product
in
these
price
range
be
make
by
the
committee
from
bottom
to
top
as
follow
chevrolet
oakland
a
new
buick
buick
old
and
cadillac
in
we
sell
sheridan
and
take
step
to
dissolve
scripps
booth
and
in
we
drop
the
chevrolet
fb
only
the
price
class
position
of
chevrolet
and
cadillac
as
it
turn
out
be
to
be
permanent
the
core
of
the
product
policy
lie
in
its
concept
of
mass
produce
a
full
line
of
car
grade
upward
in
quality
and
price
this
principle
supply
the
first
element
in
differentiate
the
general
motor
concept
of
the
market
from
that
of
the
old
ford
model
t
concept
concretely
the
general
motor
concept
provide
the
strategy
for
put
chevrolet
into
competition
with
the
model
t
without
this
policy
of
ours
mr
ford
would
not
have
have
any
competition
in
his
chosen
field
at
that
time
in
ford
have
about
percent
of
the
total
car
and
truck
market
in
unit
and
chevrolet
have
about
percent
with
ford
in
almost
complete
possession
of
the
low
price
field
it
would
have
be
suicidal
to
compete
with
him
head
on
no
conceivable
amount
of
capital
short
of
the
united
state
treasury
could
have
sustain
the
loss
require
to
take
volume
away
from
him
at
his
own
game
the
strategy
we
devise
be
to
take
a
bite
from
the
top
of
his
position
conceive
as
a
price
class
and
in
this
way
build
up
chevrolet
volume
on
a
profitable
basis
in
later
year
as
the
consumer
upgraded
his
preference
the
new
general
motor
policy
be
to
become
critically
attune
to
the
course
of
american
history
but
although
this
concept
give
us
direction
it
be
as
it
turn
out
formulate
before
its
time
it
take
a
number
of
event
in
the
automobile
market
to
give
full
substance
to
its
principle
also
a
number
of
event
in
general
motor
particularly
with
respect
to
research
and
development
that
be
the
revolutionary
car
be
to
hold
up
the
application
of
the
concept
and
keep
general
motor
in
suspense
for
the
next
couple
of
year
chapter
the
copper
cool
engine
logically
one
might
suppose
that
upon
the
adoption
of
the
concept
of
management
and
the
concept
of
the
car
business
the
new
administration
should
have
proceed
forthwith
to
translate
them
into
reality
such
however
be
not
the
case
indeed
for
the
next
two
and
a
half
year
that
be
for
most
of
the
first
definable
period
of
the
new
administration
we
depart
from
and
even
violate
those
first
principle
in
other
word
the
logic
of
the
mind
and
the
logic
of
history
be
not
of
the
same
order
this
chapter
be
a
painful
one
in
the
general
motor
story
but
i
see
no
way
to
avoid
it
if
i
be
to
account
for
general
motor
progress
for
as
often
happens
the
lesson
of
such
experience
be
the
best
learn
lesson
the
year
and
fortunately
offer
time
to
spare
for
a
school
that
be
to
have
a
considerable
part
in
shape
the
future
of
the
corporation
the
problem
be
one
of
conflict
between
the
research
organization
and
the
produce
division
and
of
a
parallel
conflict
between
the
top
management
of
the
corporation
and
the
divisional
management
the
subject
of
the
conflict
be
a
revolutionary
car
with
an
air
cool
engine
of
mr
kettering
s
design
which
pierre
s
du
pont
propose
as
a
replacement
for
the
corporation
s
conventional
car
with
water
cool
engine
the
story
begin
in
when
mr
kettering
begin
experiment
with
an
air
cool
engine
in
one
of
his
workshop
in
dayton
an
air
cool
automotive
engine
be
not
unknown
earlier
one
be
then
in
use
in
the
united
state
in
the
franklin
car
and
others
the
principle
of
air
cool
as
we
knew
it
be
to
draw
off
the
heat
of
the
engine
through
its
wall
by
attach
fin
to
the
wall
and
blowing
air
over
them
with
a
fan
the
franklin
try
to
do
this
with
cast
iron
fin
mr
kettering
propose
to
use
copper
fin
the
conductivity
of
copper
be
ten
time
that
of
cast
iron
and
to
braze
or
weld
the
fin
to
the
engine
wall
this
involve
new
technology
both
in
engine
and
in
metallurgy
mr
kettering
found
a
number
of
difficult
design
problem
in
the
area
of
expansion
and
contraction
of
the
two
metal
but
he
have
in
mind
and
under
test
solution
to
the
problem
of
design
problem
of
production
be
still
another
matter
and
of
course
belong
to
a
later
stage
of
development
the
air
cool
engine
offer
an
attractive
prospect
it
would
get
rid
of
the
cumbersome
radiator
and
plumbing
system
of
the
water
cool
engine
and
promise
to
reduce
the
number
of
part
in
the
engine
its
weight
and
its
cost
and
at
the
same
time
to
improve
engine
performance
if
it
fulfil
all
these
promise
it
would
indeed
revolutionize
the
industry
but
it
be
a
long
way
from
principle
to
reality
in
engine
design
one
have
only
to
observe
the
year
and
engineering
man
hour
take
to
develop
practical
jet
and
rocket
motor
or
to
note
that
the
water
cool
internal
combustion
engine
have
come
to
its
level
of
efficiency
after
constant
development
by
an
entire
industry
since
the
late
nineteenth
century
nevertheless
though
he
have
be
at
it
only
a
short
time
mr
kettering
s
conviction
regard
his
new
air
cool
engine
be
optimistic
and
he
have
then
a
very
considerable
reputation
in
the
automotive
field
because
of
his
pioneer
work
on
the
self
starter
and
ignition
and
light
system
and
in
the
aviation
field
where
he
be
so
far
ahead
as
to
have
experiment
with
a
pilotless
plane
mr
kettering
come
before
the
finance
committee
on
august
to
explain
the
work
he
be
do
on
the
air
cool
engine
and
on
fuel

to
result
later
in

i
have
some
part
in
the
preliminary
of
this
meeting
i
have
know
mr
kettering
since
when
his
dayton
engineering
laboratory
company
come
into
united
motor
and
have
kept
in
touch
with
his
work
on
the
day
before
the
meeting
of
the

have
met
with

there
mr

say
that
mr
charles

of
this

that
the
obtain
of
mr
kettering
s
entire
time
and
attention
be
of
prime
importance
it
be
desire

place
him
in

of
the
new
detroit

and
that
in
the
opinion
of
mr
durant
mr
haskell
mr
sloan
mr
chrysler
and
others
mr
kettering
be
by
far
the
most
valuable
man
know
to
this
corporation
for
the
position
the
finance
committee
minute
then
say
the
committee
be
advise
by
the
president
mr
durant
regard
the
air
cool
engine
which
be
be
developed
by
the
dayton
metal
product
company
and
the
possible
future
thereof
it
appear
that
this
invention
have
as
yet
not
progress
to
the
point
where
its
success
be
absolutely
assure
but
that
its
chance
of
prove
successful
be
favorable
and
that
in
this
event
our
investment
will
provide
a
splendid
financial
return
so
it
be
that
we
get
mr
kettering
s
service
the
dayton
property
and
the
air
cool
engine
and
a
good
deal
of
general
motor
history
be
set
in
motion
more
than
a
year
go
by
and
much
water
go
under
the
bridge
as
i
have
related
on
december
shortly
after
mr
du
pont
become
president
of
general
motor
mr
kettering
report
to
him
the
small
air
cool
engine
of
the
ford
type
be
now
ready
to
push
toward
a
production
basis
mr
kettering
suggest
that
a
few
car
be
make
and
test
and
that
if
they
be
satisfactory
a
number
of
car
or
might
be
make
ready
for
the
market
in
a
few
day
later
on
december
a
party
of
us
make
a
trip
to
dayton
to
look
thing
over
there

a
haskell
k
w
zimmerschied
who
be
general
manager
of
chevrolet
c
d
hartman
jr
secretary
of
the
finance
committee
and
myself
go
down
together
on
the
train
to
and
from
dayton
we
discuss
a
number
of
thing
among
them
the
air
cool
engine
a
record
of
the
discussion
say
after
careful
consideration
it
be
the
consensus
of
opinion
that
the
new
car
be
developed
at
dayton
should
be
test
in
adequate
number
and
under
the
most
rigorous
condition
before
undertaking
to
exploit
the
type
in
any
degree
when
satisfied
as
to
the
merit
of
the
product
it
will
be
adapt
for
the
chevrolet
line
and
will
replace
the
present
model
the
be
then
the
standard
low
price
chevrolet
in
our
line
potentially
though
not
then
actually
competitive
with
ford
the
question
of
a
new
engine
for
it
be
a
big
thing
conceivably
a
decisive
one
for
general
motor
in
the
high
volume
market
it
be
not
surprising
therefore
that
on
january
at
one
of
its
early
meeting
the
new
executive
committee
agree
upon
make
a
comparative
study
of
the
air
cool
engine
and
the
exist
water
cool
chevrolet
it
be
the
consensus
of
the
committee
that
no
material
change
in
the
be
possible
for
the
next
model
year
begin
in
the
autumn
of
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
await
future
development
in
the
air
cool
engine
before
decide
upon
the
change
to
be
make
for
the
production
year
begin
august
thus
we
decide
to
await
the
air
cool
car
and
in
the
interim
to
do
nothing
to
develop
the
old
water
cool
model
i
say
we
decide
for
the
executive
committee
always
make
decision
as
a
body
two
week
later
we
move
to
a
firmer
position
resolve
that
it
be
our
intention
that
the
air
cool
engine
be
developed
first
for
a
low
price
car
and
that
it
be
make
in
the
chevrolet
division
and
that
messrs
kettering
and
zimmerschied
be
inform
of
this
opinion
this
be
virtually
an
order
and
so
far
as
chevrolet
be
concerned
the
die
be
cast
in
another
two
week
the
executive
committee
expand
its
position
with
a
proposal
to
take
a
second
car
the
oakland
into
the
air
cool
program
with
a
new
six
cylinder
engine
the
executive
committee
however
note
great
uncertainty
within
itself
on
the
question
and
order
a
report
on
it
from
the
advisory
staff
of
which
i
be
then
the
head
if
i
be
not
mistaken
in
memory
the
great
uncertainty
among
the
four
of
us
on
the
committee
be
mainly
in
my
mind
this
will
become
clear
later
but
the
committee
be
lead
with
a
firm
hand
by
the
president
mr
du
pont
he
press
for
the
air
cool
program
upon
the
advancement
of
which
he
have
by
this
time
set
his
mind
another
week
later
on
february
at
a
meeting
from
which
i
be
absent
the
executive
committee
move
on
quickly
to
new
decision
it
be
assume
the
minute
say
that
the
cylinder
air
cool
car
now
under
study
and
development
would
occupy
the
low
price
field
that
second
to
this
would
be
a
cylinder
air
cool
car
sell
in
the
neighborhood
of
to
mr
kettering
be
order
to
proceed
with
the
design
and
construction
of
the
cylinder
air
cool
car
but
the
committee
say
no
quantity
production
should
be
attempt
until
success
have
be
establish
by
a
thorough
test
of
a
few
trial
car
mr
kettering
who
be
present
along
with
mr
mott
and
mr
bassett
say
he
expect
to
know
the
merit
of
both
car
by
july
and
that
preparation
for
the
manufacture
of
the
air
cool
could
be
start
on
august
with
a
view
to
bring
out
the
car
about
january
mr
zimmerschied
of
chevrolet
be
call
in
and
told
about
the
program
for
his
division
he
demur
say
he
desire
to
prepare
for
production
of
the
air
cool
in
august
he
say
he
have
improve
the
water
cool
and
have
design
a
new
body
for
it
the
executive
committee
and
the
chevrolet
division
be
thus
reveal
as
move
in
different
direction
mr
kettering
have
test
car
of
both
type
in
operation
in
dayton
in
may
and
report
that
either
the
or
could
be
first
to
come
out
on
june
the
executive
committee
agree
that
a
small
manufacturing
section
a
kind
of
pilot
operation
should
be
create
at
the
general
motor
research
corporation
later
call
our
research
laboratory
in
dayton
with
a
maximum
production
of
not
more
than
twenty
five
car
a
day
about
this
time
mr
zimmerschied
s
reservation
regard
the
air
cool
chevrolet
crystallize
and
the
divisional
problem
so
to
speak
thereby
come
to
the
foreground
where
it
be
to
remain
for
some
time
circumstance
have
dictate
that
buick
which
be
do
well
should
be
left
for
the
time
be
more
or
less
in
its
former
wholly
decentralize
state
and
with
its
own
program
but
notwithstanding
our
concept
of
organization
and
directly
contrary
to
it
expediency
be
permit
to
centralize
the
affair
of
other
division
this
trend
be
make
emphatic
by
the
decision
of
the
top
officer
to
impose
a
radical
car
design
upon
two
division
chevrolet
and
oakland
the
executive
committee
thus
make
both
the
policy
and
the
program
for
these
division
on
the
most
significant
question
that
can
come
before
a
division
namely
its
engine
and
car
design
the
executive
committee
have
that
privilege
and
in
the
circumstance
it
elect
to
exercise
it
the
difficulty
lay
not
only
in
the
question
of
whether
the
decision
regard
the
new
car
be
sound
but
in
how
to
get
it
carry
out
where
it
have
to
be
carry
out
namely
in
the
division
in
extenuation
of
what
be
do
i
should
say
that
this
be
the
first
time
to
my
knowledge
in
the
history
of
general
motor
that
intimate
cooperation
be
call
for
between
the
research
corporation
and
the
division
on
an
important
problem
and
no
establish
mean
exist
by
which
this
cooperation
be
to
function
since
the
initial
production
as
well
as
the
creation
of
the
design
be
assign
to
mr
kettering
s
research
group
in
dayton
and
the
actual
mass
production
be
assign
to
the
division
the
responsibility
be
blur
mr
zimmerschied
want
to
know
who
be
adviser
to
whom
on
production
research
to
the
car
division
or
the
car
division
to
research
even
if
there
have
be
no
question
as
to
the
merit
of
the
new
design
this
would
have
represent
a
problem
in
management
as
it
be
there
be
skepticism
at
chevrolet
about
the
new
engineering
design
and
anxiety
at
the
dayton
laboratory
that
the
car
division
would
change
the
design
divisional
engineer
and
the
general
manager
travel
back
and
forth
between
their
home
base
and
dayton
and
in
the
course
of
these
visit
mr
kettering
observe
that
george
h
hannum
general
manager
of
oakland
be
more
sympathetic
to
the
new
car
mr
kettering
also
thought
that
he
could
have
the
air
cool
ready
for
oakland
by
the
end
of
the
year
i
be
in
paris
during
the
first
part
of
july
and
on
my
return
all
four
of
us
on
the
executive
committee
again
travel
together
to
dayton
arrive
there
on
july
we
met
informally
with
mr
kettering
and
mr
mott
who
be
then
group
executive
for
the
car
division
mr
kettering
s
enthusiasm
for
the
new
car
be
strong
than
ever
it
be
he
say
the
great
thing
that
have
ever
be
produce
in
the
automobile
world
mr
du
pont
left
no
doubt
of
his
faith
in
this
judgment
mr
kettering
again
note
the
difference
between
the
attitude
at
chevrolet
and
oakland
naturally
he
be
anxious
to
work
more
closely
with
the
division
that
express
the
great
sympathy
namely
oakland
a
transcript
of
the
meeting
in
dayton
say
it
be
finally
recommend
that
the
cyl
car
be
push
ahead
and
that
the
cyl
car
be
held
up
for
the
time
be
as
it
be
felt
that
they
could
profit
by
their
experience
on
the
when
produce
the
mr
zimmerschied
of
chevrolet
it
be
believe
could
be
sell
on
the
air
cool
engine
after
the
validity
of
the
be
establish
chevrolet
anyway
mr
mott
say
have
an
inventory
of
about
s
which
still
need
to
be
liquidate
this
temporize
attitude
toward
chevrolet
be
not
permit
to
last
long
a
few
week
later
mr
du

to
the
executive
committee
a
general
review
of
the
product
situation
in

reaffirm
the
decision

when
he
come

say
be
to
be
the
adopt
standard
for
the
chevrolet
division
unless
a

and
it
should
be
ready
for

that
be
necessary
to
make
this
a
real
job
it
be
go
to
be
impossible
to
get
into
production
in
the
time
specify
in
fact
to
get
this
car
to
the
point
where
after
all
test
be
complete
and
we
be
ready
to
put
our
o
k
on
same
it
will
take
at
least
six
month
to
bridge
the
time
when
the
present
allotment
of
the
old
model
be
complete
which
will
be
about
dec
th
and
the
time
we
bring
in
the
air
cool
car
we
be
planning
on
bring
in
a
complete
new
water
cool
line
i
want
to
say
far
the
change
which
we
have
in
mind
for
the
air
cool
job
have
not
change
my
view
of
the
proposition
in
the
least
as
i
believe
when
we
get
the
first
job
on
the
road
with
the
change
incorporate
there
will
be
a
great
change
in
the
test
report
thus
in
less
than
a
month
the
adopt
schedule
of
the
corporation
be
overthrown
and
the
whole
situation
with
respect
to
oakland
and
the
future
general
motor
product
line
have
profoundly
change
there
be
disappointment
and
alarm
in
new
york
and
pessimism
in
detroit
flint
and
pontiac
concern
the
outlook
for
the
air
cool
car
between
dayton
and
the
manufacturing
division
controversy
and
confusion
arose
over
the
test
of
the
new
car
there
be
no
meeting
of
mind
between
mr
kettering
s
designer
on
the
one
hand
and
the
divisional
engineer
and
general
manager
on
the
other
mr
kettering
felt
fatigue
and
be
so
discourage
that
the
executive
committee
upon
officially
cancel
the
oakland
air
cool
schedule
on
november
sent
him
a
letter
of
confidence
as
follow
dear
kettering
it
be
most
important
in
our
opinion
that
your
mind
be
kept
free
from
worry
foreign
to
the
development
of
the
air
cool
car
and
other
laboratory
work
in
the
development
and
introduction
of
anything
so
radically
different
from
standard
practice
as
the
air
cool
car
be
from
the
regular
water
cool
job
it
be
quite
natural
that
there
should
be
a
lot
of
wiseacre
and
know
it
alls
stand
around
knock
the
development
in
order
that
your

may
be
completely
relieve
as

the
position
of
the
undersigned
with

we
beg
to

confident
in
your

be
bound

continue
until
the

be
in

would
it
not

to

to

the
year
close
with
no
definable
progress
in
the
general
motor
product
line
these
event
bother
me
to
the
extent
that
i
attempt
to
raise
them
to
a
high
level
in
my
mind
with
a
view
to
take
them
up
with
the
executive
committee
i
do
not
feel
strongly
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
technical
question
of
an
air
cool
versus
a
water
cool
engine
that
be
an
engineering
matter
for
engineer
if
i
have
any
opinion
today
it
be
that
mr
kettering
may
have
be
right
in
principle
and
ahead
of
his
time
and
that
the
division
be
right
from
a
development
and
production
standpoint
in
other
word
in
this
kind
of
situation
it
be
possible
for
the
doctor
to
disagree
and
still
all
be
right
from
a
business
and
management
standpoint
however
we
be
act
at
variance
with
our
doctrine
we
be
for
example
more
commit
to
a
particular
engineering
design
than
to
the
broad
aim
of
the
enterprise
and
we
be
in
the
situation
of
support
a
research
position
against
the
judgment
of
the
division
men
who
would
in
the
end
have
to
produce
and
sell
the
new
car
meanwhile
obsolescence
be
overtake
our
conventional
water
cool
model
and
there
be
nothing
in
the
official
program
to
protect
their
position
late
in
december
have
in
mind
the
breakdown
of
the
test
at
oakland
and
the
problem
that
the
propose
new
car
have
create
i
write
some
note
to
myself
to
clarify
in
my
mind
the
problem
of
the
corporation
with
a
view
to
discuss
them
with
pierre
s
du
pont
regard
the
dayton
situation
i
say
i
believe
that
considerable
time
have
be
lose
in
the
development
of
the
air
cool
car
through
lack
of
appreciation
undoubtedly
on
the
part
of
all
of
us
that
certain
fundamental
fact
do
not
to
any
extent
subscribe
to
the
contention
of
mr
kettering
that
everybody
in
general
motor
must
be
sell
on
the
detail
of
his
propose
car
i
believe
that
if
he
have
developed
a
car
and
demonstrate
its
performance
or
it
have
demonstrate
its
performance
in
the
hand
of
independent
observer
and
that
he
have
left
the
production
of
the
car
to
others
as
a
principle
that
we
would
have
be
farther
ahead
i
think
we
have
make
a
mistake
in
put
it
all
up
to
mr
kettering
and
not
recognize
his
particular
and
peculiar
situation
i
believe
that
the
corporation
need
and
the
industry
need
advanced
engineering
we
be
not
go
to
get
advanced
engineering
from
a
mediocre
mind
such
as
the
average
of
our
engineer
compare
with
that
of
mr
kettering
advanced
engineering
always
like
advanced
everything
else
brings
down
upon
it
the
discredit
of
ridicule
of
mind
who
cannot
see
so
far
for
all
this
reason
such
engineering
must
be
demonstrate
in
such
a
way
that
the
fact
must
be
accepted
rather
than
theory
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
have
be
any
trouble
in
oakland
or
that
any
change
would
have
be
suggest
have
mr
kettering
wait
until
he
have
a
car
that
would
demonstrate
a
reasonable
satisfactory
performance
i
fear
that
the
way
this
be
work
will
result
in
the
loss
of
a
great
many
of
the
idea
that
we
need
so
badly
and
can
only
accept
from
a
man
of
mr
kettering
s
marvelous
ability
the
write
of
this
memorandum
serve
mainly
to
mark
a
turn
point
in
my
conduct
concern
the
air
cool
engine
i
begin
then
to
pursue
a
dual
policy
first
continue
to
support
mr
du
pont
s
and
mr
kettering
s
hope
for
the
new
car
and
second
give
support
to
the
division
in
the
development
of
alternate
program
of
the
conventional
water
cool
type
and
incidentally
on
the
side
for
a
while
mr
zimmerschied
and
i
look
into
a
new
muir
steam
cool
system
which
never
go
into
production
while
mr
du
pont
have
no
enthusiasm
for
alternative
to
the
air
cool
engine
he
do
not
forbid
my
take
this
position
we
simply
work
along
somewhat
different
line
but
such
a
situation
between
the
two
lead
member
of
the
operating
organization
be
not
entirely
comfortable
and
could
not
last
forever
for
the
next
sixteen
month
the
air
cool
car
continued
to
distract
the
corporation
and
to
keep
its
lead
officer
in
a
state
of
tension
over
the
question
of
what
the
future
product
of
the
corporation
be
to
be
at
the
begin
of
the
pressure
on
chevrolet
for
the
new
car
be
increase
while
that
on
oakland
be
somewhat
relieve
i
take
a
first
step
toward
the
compromise
which
i
felt
be
necessary
to
protect
the
corporation
in
the
event
of
failure
of
the
new
program
and
to
bridge
the
gap
that
have
open
between
top
management
and
the
division
as
vice
president
of
operation
i
held
a
meeting
in
my
room
in
the
hotel
statler
in
detroit
on
january
with
mr
mott
car
group
executive
mr
bassett
buick
and
mr
zimmerschied
chevrolet
and
reach
an
understand
that
the
official
air
cool
program
for
chevrolet
be
to
be
advanced
but
with
caution
the
official
program
require
that
the
experimental
air
cool
model
under
development
at
dayton
if
proper
should
be
put
in
production
by
the
chevrolet
division
as
of
september
that
be
just
seven
month
away
though
the
chevrolet
management
have
not
yet
receive
a
test
car
from
dayton
we
agree
however
that
there
be
nothing
before
the
corporation
or
the
chevrolet
division
at
the
present
time
to
justify
the
positive
conclusion
that
the
air
cool
car
should
be
put
into
production
on
the
date
specify
but
that
on
april
after
test
have
be
make
we
could
determine
a
safe
program
at
the
same
time
we
agree
that
a
second
line
of
defense
should
be
prepared
this
be
only
a
conservative
policy
the
second
line
of
defense
be
a
parallel
effort
in
the
division
to
improve
the
exist
water
cool
chevrolet
as
to
oakland
on
february
i
report
to
the
executive
committee
and
obtain
approval
to
postpone
a
new
schedule
for
the
air
cool
production
of
which
have
be
cancel
for
oakland
then
we
agree
to
continue
its
recently
establish
water
cool
model
for
a
period
of
a
year
and
a
half
end
june
to
eliminate
from
consideration
as
far
as
oakland
be
concerned
the
introduction
of
any
air
cool
model
previous
to
that
date
that
any
design
that
oakland
may
develop
in
the
meantime
will
be
in
accordance
with
the
program
of
design
already
establish
by
the
corporation
that
if
the
economic
position
of
the
oakland
model
change
s
to
the
extent
that
the
division
be
unable
to
break
even
step
will
have
to
be
take
at
that
time
as
seem
best
in
view
of
all
the
circumstance
prevail
at
that
time
since
the
research
corporation
at
dayton
be
the
only
substantial
corporation
wide
staff
engineering
group
in
general
motor
at
the
time
and
it
be
occupy
with
the
air
cool
engine
experiment
the
advanced
engineering
for
the
water
cool
model
devolve
largely
upon
the
division
all
of
the
car
division
at
that
time
be
in
need
of
advanced
engineering
staff
work
to
make
and
keep
their
conventional
car
competitive
at
chevrolet
oakland
and
old
the
need
be
acute
in
other
word
the
division
have
to
attend
not
only
to
their
principal
business
of
engineering
manufacturing
and
sell
current
model
but
to
their
own
staff
work
on
forward
engineering
as
well
not
that
matter
have
be
any
different
in
this
area
previously
but
it
be
our
intention
to
provide
for
comprehensive
engineering
staff
work
for
the
corporation
from
the
way
in
which
the
research
corporation
chose
to
operate
that
be
as
a
long
range
idea
organization
center
upon
mr
kettering
s
unusual
capability
it
be
evident
that
a
gap
have
open
between
his
important
function
and
the
bread
and
butter
type
of
advanced
engineering
i
do
not
then
know
that
a
historic
distinction
be
be
make
in
general
motor
but
i
saw
the
gap
before
me
and
on
march
obtain
approval
of
a
policy
of
seek
outside
engineering
design
for
the
division
this
policy
would
never
solve
the
problem
but
it
would
help
many
year
would
pas
before
the
problem
be
entirely
understood
and
met
among
those
whom
i
consult
at
that
time
be
henry
crane
who
later
come
into
the
corporation
as
technical
assistant
to
the
president
and
contribute
importantly
to
the
corporation
s
engineering
progress
especially
in
the
design
of
the
pontiac
car
o
e
hunt
have
only
recently
in
october
be
brought
by
mr
zimmerschied
into
chevrolet
as
chief
engineer
and
i
be
not
yet
familiar
with
his
fine
capability
the
compromise
between
the
air
cool
and
water
cool
development
at
chevrolet
be
an
uneasy
one
it
be
soon
accompany
by
a
change
in
management
on
february
at
mr
mott
s
suggestion
william
s
knudsen
who
have
formerly
be
ford
s
production
manager
be
brought
into
the

s
advisory
staff
and
assign
as
manufacturing
assistant
to
mr
mott
mr
knudsen
visit
dayton
and
on
march
make
a
report
on
the
air
cool
car
in
which
he
recommend
that
the
car
be
put
in
production
at
once
he
advise
me
however
that
he
meant
that
production
should
be
start
in
a
small
way
to
test
the
car
both
commercially
and
technically
on
march
mr
du
pont
obtain
the
agreement
of
the
executive
committee
to
remove
mr
zimmerschied
from
his
post
as
general
manager
of
chevrolet
and
make
him
assistant
to
the
president
of
general

and
to
appoint
mr
knudsen
as
vice
president
of
operation
at
chevrolet
mr
du
pont
also
propose
to
make
himself
general
manager
of
the
chevrolet
division
while
remain
chairman
and
president
of
the
corporation
and
it
be
agree
on
april
at
the
president
s
request
we
officially
name
the
experimental
development
the
copper
cool
instead
of
the
air
cool
engine
mr
du
pont
wish
to
differentiate
it
from
other
system
of
air
cool
but
mr
kettering
continued
to
say
air
cool
preparation
for
tool
up
for
production
of
the
copper
cool
chevrolet
begin
with
manufacture
expect
to
start
about
september
at
ten
car
a
day
increase
to
fifty
a
day
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
canadian
organization
too
be
instruct
to
develop
and
introduce
a
copper
cool
but
the
spring
of
pass
without
bring
any
reality
to
the
new
program
the
copper
cool
engine
remain
under
test
at
dayton
spring
sale
of
car
show
to
be
a
year
of
fair
recovery
and
the
chevrolet
underdeveloped
as
it
be
in
engineering
design
be
sell
again
at
a
meeting
in
detroit
in
may
at
which
mr
du
pont
mr
mott
mr
knudsen
colin
campbell
then
sale
manager
of
chevrolet
and
i
be
present
mr
mott
with
my
support
propose
another
compromise
namely
to
put
the
new
chevrolet
body
design
for
the
copper
cool
car
on
the
old
chassis
in
the
fall
to
make
certain
that
we
would
have
something
new
to
sell
for
the
next
model
year
mr
campbell
oppose
this
say
he
be
afraid
to
load
up
the
dealer
with
s
during
the
winter
and
then
give
them
copper
cool
car
in
the
spring
of
again
i
try
to
advance
the
policy
of
a
dual
program
say
we
should
use
the
copper
cool
car
as
an
experiment
until
april
st
then
if
it
have
become
successful
and
be
hold
up
in
the
field
increase
production
on
the
copper
cool
job
and
on
august
st
bring
in
the
car
as
the
sole
product
of
the
chevrolet
division
if
the
car
be
not
successful
we
could
continue
to
manufacture
the
s
the
difference
thus
be
laid
on
the
table
but
nothing
be
decide
the
parallel
program
and
proposal
for
program
create
inevitable
tension
in
the
corporation
mr
kettering
continued
to
feel
that
the
division
be
drag
their
foot
oakland
he
observe
be
now
several
month
behind
chevrolet
in
the
copper
cool
development
and
chevrolet
plan
he
say
be
inadequate
he
say
in
may
of
that
he
be
work
best
with
robert
jack
chief
engineer
of
old
mr
du
pont
support
mr
kettering
s
opinion
of
chevrolet
s
plan
and
in
june
propose
a
stiffen
of
the
copper
cool
program
at
that
division
since
chassis
and
body
change
for
the
new
engine
be
expect
to
be
complete
in
the
fall
and
the
change
over
then
would
be
concerned
with
the
engine
only
he
recommend
that
production
of
the
copper
cool
chevrolet
be
schedule
for
the
forthcoming
winter
in
september
production
have
not
begin
but
the
official
expectation
be
optimistic
the
plan
for
chevrolet
be
to
have
a
monthly
capacity
of
water
cool
and
copper
cool
car
by
march
and
to
convert
the
entire
water
cool
production
into
copper
cool
by
july
or
at
the
late
october
in
november
mr
kettering
note
a
lack
of
interest
in
the
copper
cool
car
at
old
as
well
as
at
oakland
i
say
to
mr
du
pont
that
i
be
fearful
of
the
outcome
of
commit
three
main
division
to
a
new
untried
engineering
car
design
mr
du
pont
point
out
to
me
that
the
decision
have
be
make
by
the
executive
committee
some
month
ago
and
that
the
only
decision
left
be
the
question
of
a
change
of
front
or
the
abandonment
absolutely
of
all
experiment
with
water
cool
and
steam
cool
car
he
agree
however
that
there
would
be
no
final
determination
with
regard
to
chevrolet
until
may
he
then
propose
that
the
old
program
be
convert
exclusively
to
copper
cool
mr
du
pont
s
and
my
view
be
then
express
on
november
in
this
compromise
resolution
of
the
executive
committee
resolve
that
the
copper
cool
program
shall
be
as
follow
that
the
product
of
the
old
division
as
of
august
st
shall
be
a
six
cylinder
copper
cool
car
all
experiment
and
development
of
water
cool
motor
shall
be
discontinue
from
this
date
november
th
the
chevrolet
motor
division
will
proceed
with
the
development
of
its
copper
cool
model
cautiously
with
a
view
to
determine
all
factor
involve
both
commercially
and
technically
always
recognize
as
be
present
in
the
development
of
any
new
product
in
such
a
way
that
the
hazard
to
the
corporation
be
at
all
time
kept
at
a
minimum
the
policy
of
the
oakland
division
will
be
hereafter
determine
but
under
no
circumstance
shall
the
oakland
company
put
in
production
a
copper
cool
car
of
any
kind
or
description
until
the
position
of
the
copper
cool
car
as
a
type
be
determine
in
a
broad
way
by
actual
experience
in
the
field
of
a
sufficient
number
of
car
such
experience
be
both
of
a
technical
and
commercial
nature
thus
at
the
end
of
we
be
commit
exclusively
to
the
copper
cool
program
at
old
to
a
dual
program
at
chevrolet
and
oakland
be
exempt
until
the
new
car
have
prove
itself
in
december
mr
knudsen
begin
to
manufacture
copper
cool
car
at
chevrolet
the
year
like
end
with
uncertainty
as
to
what
the
engineering
design
of
the
general

product
be
to
be
at
the
new

about
above
the

be
the
sensation
of
the

the
chevrolet

call
for
the
manufacture
of
copper
cool
car
in
february
with
the
monthly
rate
to
increase
to
in
october
the
only
question
that
seem
to
remain
at
the
begin
of
the
new

regard
the
water

be
the
exact
date
on
which
it
should
be
abandon
but
trouble
appear
in
the
course
of
production
and
chevrolet
copper
cool
car
fail
to
appear
in
february
in
large
number
two
decisive
event
occur
simultaneously
during
the
month
of
march
april
and
may
first
we
found
ourselves
in
the
great
boom
year
up
to
that
time
in
automobile
history
the
begin
of
the

first
four
million

second
difficulty
in
production
have
slow
the
manufacture
of
copper

chevrolets
to
a
walk
and
the
few
copper
cool
chevrolets
that
be
on
the
road
and
be
checked
by
the
division
produce
a
large
number
of
report
of
trouble
indicate
that
they
be
still
experimental
unproved
and
in
need
of
far
development
the
question
of
what
to
do
require
no
great
act
of
mind
the
only
chevrolet
we
have
to
sell
be
the
old
conventional
water
cool
model
although
it
be
not
a
high
performance
automobile
even
for
those
day
the
chevrolet
water
cool
superior
model
have
be
improve
and
it
be
a
workable
car
it
ran
up
record
sale
that
spring
one
could
feel
that
a
new
era
in
the
demand
for
automobile
have
open
up
and
it
be
imperative
that
the
corporation
settle
upon
its
product
program
for
a
future
that
would
present
itself
but
once
on
may
mr
du
pont
resign
as
president
of
general
motor
and
on
his
recommendation
to
the
board
i
succeed
him
in
that
office
we
continued
to
disagree
on
the
merit
of
the
copper
cool
program
but
it
be
left
to
me
as
chief
executive
officer
to
make
the
decision
at
old
in
accordance
with
prevail
policy
all
work
on
the
water
cool
car
have
stop
the
inventory
of

be
be
sell
off
at
a
loss
of
about
fifty
dollar
a
car
while
the
division
wait
to
go
into
production
of
the
new
copper
cool
on
august
but
the
trouble
with
the
copper
cool
chevrolet
clearly
threaten
the
validity
of
this
program
as
president
i
be
of
course
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
which
be
enlarge
to
include
fred
fisher
head
of
fisher
body
and
mr

and
at
the
first
meeting
at
which
i
preside
on
may
i
take
up
the
old
question
i
state
the
fact
about
the
old
situation
and
say
the
continued
delay
in
produce
the
chevrolet
copper
cool
car
be
a
constant
reminder
of
the
uncertainty
and
the
difficulty
in
engineering
and
manufacture
which
would
most
certainly
delay
the
program
and
might
lead
to
serious
embarrassment
to
the
old
motor
work
organization
at
the
factory
and
throughout
the
world
after
a
discussion
with
mr
kettering
mr
knudsen
and
mr

we
appoint
a

of

the

be
the
main
business
of
the

the

that
the

pre
ignites
badly
after
drive
at
moderate
speed
in
air
temperature
from

that
it

the

several
minor
one
which
can
be
report
in
detail
if
you
so
desire
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
job
be
not
in
shape
for
immediate
production
we
recommend
that
we
set
it
aside
for

development
and
it
be
left
out
of
consideration
as

that

of
these
about

of
which
about
go

in
june
the
chevrolet
division
decide
to
recall
all
of
these
copper
cool
car
from
the
field
on
june
in
a
letter
to
me
mr
kettering
propose
to
take
the
copper
cool
engine
out
of
general
motor
he
write
we
start
out
to
do
a
perfectly
definite
thing
which
have
be
do
and
it
be
just
the
same
now
as
it
be
a
year
ago
but
in
the
transition
stage
certain
factor
have
enter
into
this
which
have
confuse
the
thing
to
the
point
where
unless
thing
can
be
clarify
i
believe
the
whole
proposition
should
be
drop
if
we
cannot
get
some
practical
way
of
commercialize
this
product
in
our
own
organization
i
should
like
very
much
to
discus
with
you
the
possibility
of
take
this
outside
of
the
corporation
and
this
be
a
thing
which
have
come
up
within
the
last
week
i
be
sure
i
can
get
capital
and
pretty
much
of
an
organization
to
go
do
this
job
the
way
in
which
i
know
it
can
be
do
it
appear
that
he
do
not
understand
then
that
the
copper
cool
chevrolets
have
be
withdrawn
four
day
later
upon
his
learn
of
this
decision
mr
kettering
write
to
me
again
and
propose
to
resign
from
the
corporation
i
have
definitely
make
up
my
mind
to
leave
the
corporation
unless
some
method
can
be
arrange
to
prevent
the
fundamental
work
do
here
from
be
thrown
out
and
discredit
through
no
fault
of
the
apparatus
i
be
perfectly
sure
that
we
can
take
any
proposition
and
make
out
of
it
a
success
provide
we
do
not
have
to
overcome
an
organize
resistance
within
the
corporation
this
be
impossible
unless
the
executive
committee
can
take
it
upon
themselves
to
force
through
an
executive
order
when
they
know
it
be
go
to
be
of
value
to
the
corporation
i
regret
very
much
that
this
situation
have
developed
i
have
be
extremely
unhappy
and
know
that
i
have
make
you
and
mr
du
pont
equally
unhappy
by
my
frequently
discuss
this
matter
with
you
i
be
not
temperamentally
constitute
where
i
can
sit
down
and
do
nothing
i
have
never
fail
in
any
proposition
that
i
have
undertaken
yet
the
work
here
at
the
laboratory
i
realize
have
be
almost
failure
but
not
because
of
the
fundamental
principle
involve
enough
may
have
come
out
of
the
laboratory
to
have
paid
for
their
existence
but
no
one
will
care
to
continue
in
research
activity
as
the
situation
now
stand
my
only
regret
in
sever
my
connection
with
the
corporation
would
be
the
wonderful
association
i
have
have
with
yourself
mr
du
pont
mr
mott
and
others
there
be
many
possibility
for
work
of
the
kind
which
i
can
do
in
industry
where
the
problem
which
exist
in
get
new
thing
over
be
not
quite
as
difficult
as
in
the
motor
industry
therefore
i
hope
after
reading
this
that
you
can
formulate
some
definite
plan
whereby
either
the
situation
within
the
corporation
can
be
clear
up
or
i
can
be
relieve
of
my
present
duty
i
would
like
to
have
some
definite
conclusion
reach
on
this
as
soon
as
possible
as
i
would
like
to
formulate
definite
plan
mr
kettering
be
always
very
frank
in
our
forty
year
of
friendship
and
association
he
always
spoke
his
mind
clearly
to
me
and
i
spoke
the
same
way
to
him
i
think
that
this
be
our
bad
moment
his
biographer
t
a
boyd
have
write
the
discontinuance
of
the
copper
cool
chevrolet
in
the
summer
of
be
a
stagger
blow
to
him
it
be
then
that
his
spirit
reach
the
low
point
in
his
research
career
i
knew
that
but
i
be
as
certain
of
the
position
i
felt
i
have
to
take
as
he
be
of
his
and
of
course
we
have
different
responsibility
management
involves
more
than
technical
problem
i
could
not
as
i
saw
it
in
the
face
of
an
expand
market
hold
up
the
program
of
the
corporation
for
an
uncertain
development
if
i
have
do
so
i
do
not
believe
there
would
be
a
general
motor
today
we
would
have
miss
the
boat
furthermore
however
sound
the
engine
might
have
be
in
principle
it
be
not
my
policy
then
or
at
any
time
afterward
to
force
on
the
division
a
thing
of
this
kind
against
their
judgment
on
this
question
though
not
on
any
other
there
have
unfortunately
open
a
wide
gap
in
the
corporation
with
mr
kettering
his
laboratory
and
mr
du
pont
on
one
side
and
myself
and
the
division
on
the
other
i
be
anxious
to
close
it
my
problem
be
to
reconcile
mr
kettering
s
natural
reaction
and
enthusiasm
for
his
new
idea
with
the
reality
in
the
case
the
copper
cool
car
have
fail
to
meet
the
test
of
validity
it
have
fail
at
oakland
it
have
be
adjudge
as
need
far
development
by
a
joint
study
make
by
the
chief
engineer
of
buick
chevrolet
and
northway
a
highly
competent
group
sample
car
produce
by
chevrolet
and
sent
into
the
field
have
be
withdrawn
because
of
various
defect
the
problem
be
complicate
by
the
uncertainty
of
a
new
chassis
as
well
as
a
new
engine
we
have
to
recognize
that
research
engineer
have
little
experience
relatively
speak
in
chassis
design
as
compare
with
the
engineering
staff
of
the
operating
division
i
have
of
necessity
to
respect
all
these
fact
and
circumstance
on
july
i
write
mr
kettering
a
letter
from
which
i
quote
the
follow
you
say
that
you
learn
the
day
before
yesterday
that
all
chevrolet
car
be
to
be
take
off
the
market
now
you
recollect
in
mr
du
pont
s
office
in
detroit
it
be
agree
that
the
copper
cool
chevrolet
car
would
be
discontinue
so
far
as
far
assembly
be
concerned
and
assembly
would
not
be
start
again
until
messrs
knudsen
hunt
and
yourself
report
to
us
that
it
be
satisfactory
to
do
this
you
be
a
party
to
this
you
recollect
and
it
seem
after
a
very
lengthy
discussion
in
which
many
technicality
be
brought
up
that
this
be
the
right
thing
to
do
at
the
same
conference
it
be
agree
that
for
the
sale
year
begin
august
st
the
copper
cool
car
would
he
continued
and
mr
campbell
be
authorize
to
write
contract
both
way
you
recollect
that
therefore
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
chevrolet
position
as
agree
to
at
that
conference
be
first
that
they
would
sell
both
car
during
the
sale
year
of
and
second
that
no
copper
cool
would
be
assemble
until
it
be
far
authorize
therefore
you
can
see
that
they
be
in
a
rather
embarrass
position
they
be
told
that
there
will
be
two
car
and
yet
they
can
only
produce
one
i
just
mention
this
so
that
there
will
be
no
misunderstand
it
be
call
to
my
attention
recently
that
there
be
copper
cool
car
out
in
the
territory
and
it
appear
to
be
desirable
to
withdraw
them
and
reassemble
them
in
other
word
it
be
thought
desirable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
be
more
or
less
complaint
not
deal
with
the
engine
particularly
but
deal
with
the
whole
car
that
they
should
be
take
in
and
an
adjustment
make
there
be
nothing
say
that
it
be
due
to
engine
trouble
or
anything
else
it
simply
seem
all
thing
consider
to
be
the
desirable
thing
to
do
you
must
appreciate
that
when
these
thing
be
do
the
policy
have
to
be
work
out
in
detail
and
it
be
sometimes
impossible
to
get
all
of
the
many
people
that
have
to
carry
out
the
thing
to
thoroughly
understand
and
properly
present
the
real
reason
behind
the
policy
i
pas
over
matter
which
be
not
essential
here
and
go
on
to
the
conclusion
of
my
letter
i
do
not
agree
with
you
that
the
situation
be
in
any
sense
hopeless
i
have
great
confidence
in
our
organization
speak
of
it
as
a
whole
i
think
they
be
entitle
to
the
credit
that
be
due
them
and
they
be
also
entitle
to
the
discredit
of
their
shortcoming
if
i
might
put
it
so
the
great
trouble
be
that
there
be
an
apparent
lack
of
confidence
in
this
copper
cool
car
and
notwithstanding
that
the
executive
of
the
corporation
and
the
executive
committee
have
try
to
do
their
best
to
get
it
across
the
fact
that
our
division
have
not
believe
in
it
so
far
have
make
it
practically
an
impossible
problem
that
as
i
see
it
be
the
real
problem
before
us
it
be
not
the
merit
of
the
case
and
day
and
week
spent
over
it
will
not
alter
the
situation
what
we
have
get
to
do
be
to
make
our
people
see
the
thing
as
you
see
it
and
with
that
accomplish
then
there
will
be
nothing
more
to
the
problem
i
do
not
think
that
force
the
issue
be
go
to
get
us
anywhere
we
have
try
that
and
we
have
fail
we
have
get
to
go
at
it
in
a
different
manner
if
we
be
go
to
succeed
i
have
quote
from
this
letter
at
some
length
because
of
the
various
matter
it
brings
up
most
of
which
be
self
evident
at
least
as
to
what
my
position
be
in
an
effort
to
relieve
the
tension
i
propose
a
new
development
program
for
the
copper
cool
car
it
appear
clear
that
one
basic
mistake
be
a
divide
responsibility
the
executive
committee
the
operating
division
and
the
research
corporation
all
with
different
viewpoint
both
within
themselves
and
with
each
other
be
try
to
do
an
administrative
job
it
be
clear
that
we
now
must
get
back
to
sound
principle
concentrate
the
responsibility
in
a
single
place
and
support
that
effort
my
plan
be
to
create
an
independent
pilot
operation
under
the
sole
jurisdiction
of
mr
kettering
a
kind
of
copper
cool
car
division
mr
kettering
would
designate
his
own
chief
engineer
and
his
production
staff
to
solve
the
technical
problem
of
manufacture
and
his
organization
would
market
the
copper
cool
car
they
would
make
a
few
or
many
as
the
circumstance
dictate
such
a
program
would
provide
mr
kettering
a
free
hand
without
interference
to
demonstrate
successfully
the
validity
of
the
concept
in
which
he
have
so
much
confidence
to
appraise
the
new
approach
i
call
a
meeting
of
fred
fisher
stewart
mott
and
myself
we
all
be
sympathetic
to
this
propose
solution
of
the
problem
i
quote
from
a
memorandum
i
sent
to
mr
du
pont
on
july
mr
fisher
mr
mott
and
myself
have
a
long
talk
yesterday
regard
a
policy
that
would
be
more
constructive
and
more
fundamental
than
the
one
we
have
be
pursue
heretofore
we
feel
that
in
force
the
division
to
take
something
they
do
not
believe
in
and
in
which
there
be
certain
argumentative
point
yet
to
be
demonstrate
be
not
get
us
anywhere
and
with
the
divide
responsibility
between
the
chief
engineer
and
mr
kettering
we
be
not
go
to
get
anywhere
unless
the
responsibility
be
positively
assure
in
the
hand
of
one
or
the
other
party
we
be
most
anxious
to
practically
demonstrate
the
commercial
value
of
the
proposition
and
believe
that
the
solution
practically
determine
upon
subject
to
your
approval
be
the
only
way
out
we
have
discuss
the
matter
with
mr
kettering
at
some
length
this
morning
and
he
agrees
with
us
absolutely
on
every
point
we
make
he
appear
to
receive
the
suggestion
very
enthusiastically
and
have
every
confidence
that
it
can
be
put
across
along
these
line
the
plan
be
base
upon
the
follow
principle
that
as
we
stand
today
our
effort
to
commercially
develop
the
copper
cool
have
result
in
a
total
loss
and
we
feel
that
we
be
bad
off
than
we
be
two
year
ago
on
account
of
the
resistance
which
have
be
set
up
on
account
of
our
repeat
failure
that
the
engineering
responsibility
for
put
the
job
across
must
be
definitely
centralize
in
one
man
that
we
feel
that
the
only
way
to
get
the
desire
result
be
to
establish
an
independent
operation
with
the
sole
purpose
of
commercially
demonstrate
the
copper
cool
idea
therefore
we
have
decide
to
set
up
a
new
division
at
dayton
use
a
part
of
the
research
plant
especially
that
part
which
be
be
vacate
by
the
aeroplane
division
and
we
will
set
up
an
organization
there
which
will
be
more
or
less
of
an
assembly
proposition
mr
kettering
will
have
complete
charge
of
the
engineering
side
of
it
operating
through
a
chief
engineer
whom
he
will
appoint
the
new
operation
will
take
over
the
four
cylinder
copper
cool
engine
and
probably
the
six
cylinder
old
and
will
market
these
two
copper
cool
job
under
their
own
name
start
with
five
or
ten
a
day
and
building
up
as
the
demand
increase
all
tool
equipment
and
inventory
already
developed
will
be
available
except
so
far
as
mr
kettering
may
determine
to
make
change
the
operation
will
be
of
a
specialty
nature
put
an
extra
long
price
on
the
job
on
account
of
the
comparatively
small
production
and
special
nature
of
the
power
plant
add
attractive
feature
to
the
body
which
we
feel
sure
will
get
the
job
across
mr
fisher
mr
mott
and
myself
feel
that
this
be
the
only
way
out
and
place
the
responsibility
where
it
belongs
and
eliminate
all
confusion
with
the
other
division
who
can
go
ahead
about
their
business
in
their
own
way
as
they
have
very
big
problem
to
work
out
to
maintain
their
present
position
for
the
future
i
believe
that
it
be
useless
to
attempt
to
establish
an
agreement
between
mr
kettering
and
mr
hunt
or
mr
kettering
and
anyone
else
on
these
various
technical
point
involve
in
the
copper
cool
development
they
never
will
agree
and
one
or
the
other
must
be
require
to
work
the
thing
out
largely
in
his
own
way
along
line
that
commend
itself
to
his
judgment
mr
du
pont
do
not
approve
of
this
plan
to
segregate
the
copper
cool
development
from
the
division
and
their
large
sale
organization
but
in
the
end
he
accepted
it
with
the
burden
of
the
copper
cool
development
place
in
dayton
under
mr
kettering
s
jurisdiction
and
the
car
division
clear
to
proceed
on
standard
water
cool
program
i
write
on
july
a
memo
of
review
to
the
member
of
the
executive
committee
from
which
i
quote
the
follow
two
and
a
half
year
have
elapse
since
the
reconstruction
of
general
motor
commenced
and
in
that
time
due
to
the
jam
we
have
get
into
on
account
of
the
copper
cool
the
position
of
our
chevrolet
car
have
not
make
the
progress
that
i
think
it
should
have
make
certainly
every
step
that
have
be
take
have
be
carefully
consider
and
many
reason
could
be
ascribed
to
this
result
and
probably
there
would
be
some
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
really
have
contribute
to
the
cause
but
nevertheless
the
fact
remains
and
the
object
of
this
memorandum
be
to
simply
point
out
certain
advantage
that
would
accrue
have
we
an
intensively
developed
model
at
this
time
or
what
we
can
expect
to
gain
by
get
such
a
model
at
the
early
possible
moment
undoubtedly
all
these
advantage
or
certainly
the
most
important
one
would
be
available
if
the
power
plant
be
copper
cool
as
well
as
water
cool
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
real
difference
between
the
two
design
would
be
material
other
than
that
the
copper
cool
would
eliminate
water
which
if
all
other
condition
be
the
same
would
undoubtedly
be
a
step
in
advance
this
memorandum
be
not
a
mere
expression
of
regret
for
lose
time
but
a
preamble
to
a
new
program
of
advance
with
new
design
for
the
water
cool
chevrolet
that
would
be
put
into
competition
in
the
low
price
high
volume
market
in
accordance
with
the
product

of
the
copper
cool
car
never
come
up
again
in
a
big
way
it
just
die
out
i
don
t
know
why
the
great
boom
be
on
and
meeting
the
demand
for
car
and
meeting
the
competition
with
improve
water

our
attention
and
energy
many
year
later
the
state
of
the
art
of

to
the
point
where
application
of
its
principle
to

of
such

many
of
his

the

be
laid
down
in
the

of
we
need
now
concretely
to

such
very
different

problem

and
decentralization
begin
at
the
top
of
the
corporation
and
be
now
my
responsibility
what
i
do
about
it
i
have
already
begin
to
do
in
the
first
period
of
the
new
administration
in
my
note
on
the
situation
in
the
corporation
which
i
have
write
at
the
end
of
i
introduce
the
question
of
decentralization
in
relation
to
the
activity
of
the
top
executive
group
first
i
set
down
a
declaration
of
principle
as
follow
that
i
approach
the
matter
of
organization
from
the
standpoint
of
a
thorough
belief
in
a
decentralize
organization
i
still
after
a
year
s
experience
be
just
as
firmly
of
the
same
belief
that
a
decentralize
organization
be
the
only
one
that
will
develop
the
talent
necessary
to
meet
the
corporation
s
big
problem
but
certain
thing
notwithstanding
a
decentralize
organization
must
be
recognize
and
i
appreciate
these
much
more
than
i
do
before
the
main
question
i
say
look
forward
to
the
liquidation
of
the
emergency
of
be
related
to
the
executive
committee
itself
the
high
body
in
the
operating
structure
these
question
be
the
role
of
the
executive
committee
as
a
policy
make
group
the
representation
from
the
operating
side
and
the
need
for
authority
in
the
person
of
the
president
i
write
a
that
the
executive
committee
should
confine
itself
more
particularly
to
principle
which
should
be
present
to
it
by
the
operating
organization
properly
developed
and
thoughtfully
carry
out
rather
than
to
constitute
itself
as
it
be
now
a
group
management
this
need
little
explanation
in
view
of
what
i
have
already
related
but
let
me
say
that
though
i
have
often
be
taxed
by
people
who
do
not
know
me
with
be
a
committee
man
and
in
a
sense
i
most
certainly
be
i
have
never
believe
that
a
group
as
such
could
manage
anything
a
group
can
make
policy
but
only
individual
can
administer
policy
at
that
time
and
in
particular
in
relation
to
the
copper
cool
engine
the
four
of
us
on
the
executive
committee
be
in
my
opinion
try
to
manage
the
division
my
next
point
be
not
specifically
aim
at
the
lack
of
automotive
experience
but
at
the
need
for
integration
of
the
top
executive
committee
and
the
operating
organization
b
the
operating
side
on
the
executive
committee
be
not
strongly
enough
represent
this
should
be
correct
by
the
increase
of
the
executive
committee
and
i
suggest
messrs
mott
mclaughlin
and
bassett
as
additional
member
the
executive
committee
to
meet
not
oftener
than
every
two
week
and
perhaps
once
a
month
i
then
propose
that
the
president
should
assume
not
less
but
more
authority
this
be
not
as
surprising
as
it
may
seem
at
first
sight
for
it
follow
the
principle
that
an
individual
and
not
a
group
should
administer
in
actual
fact
general
operation
have
devolve
on
me
at
the
time
i
be
vice
president
of
operation
and
we
have
a
situation
of
confuse
authority
i
write
as
follow
c
whoever
be
in
charge
of
operation
should
be
designate
with
real
authority
to
be
use
in
case
of
an
emergency
it
will
probably
be
best
if
the
president
of
the
corporation
could
absolutely
have
charge
of
operation
if
this
be
not
feasible
somebody
should
be
so
appoint
and
whoever
have
charge
should
develop
a
reasonable
organization
to
contact
with
the
operation
side
as
well
as
the
executive
committee
i
then
give
example
of
the
distinction
between
policy
and
administration
overall
pricing
policy
i
say
should
be
reserve
to
the
executive
committee
obviously
since
we
be
work
with
divisional
price
class
we
be
not
likely
to
want
cadillac
to
produce
a
car
in
the
chevrolet
price
class
and
on
the
question
of
executive
committee
action
on
the
character
and
quality
of
product
i
write
as
follow
it
would
seldom
be
suitable
for
the
executive
committee
to
approve
the
specification
of
contemplate
product
or
even
the
principal
characteristic
unless
they
be
of
peculiar
significance
as
involve
the
entry
into
new
field
or
the
possibility
of
undermine
the
position
of
exist
profitable
line
the
executive
committee
should
treat
with
the
question
from
the
standpoint
of
policy
and
in
the
direction
of
regulate
the
general
quality
of
product
of
division
respectively
so
as
to
gain
a
wholesome
distribution
of
product
by
class
range
and
the
avoidance
of
undue
interference
between
division
a
carefully
design
policy
should
be
enunciate
that
will
convey
to
each
division
a
complete
understand
of
the
general
quality
of
product
that
should
be
attain
or
maintain
and
all
major
alteration
of
design
should
be
submit
to
the
executive
committee
for
approval
from
this
standpoint
the
executive
committee
should
not
attempt
to
pas
upon
the
mechanical
feature
but
must
rely
upon
some
competent
individual
or
body
in
the
operating
organization
in
general
the
activity
of
the
executive
committee
should
be
guide
along
the
line
of
establish
policy
and
lay
the
same
down
in
such
clear
cut
and
comprehensive
term
as
to
supply
the
basis
of
authorize
executive
action
i
cannot
recall
how
mr
du
pont
express
himself
on
these
proposal
i
think
he
must
have
agree
for
he
cooperate
in
bring
them
into
effect
in
he
cause
to
be
elect
to
the
executive
committee
mr
mott
and
fred
j
fisher
both
experienced
in
operation
and
later
in
when
i
be
its
chairman
he
concur
in
add
mr
bassett
mr
brown
mr
pratt
charles
t
fisher
and
lawrence
p
fisher
make
ten
in
all
seven
experienced
in
operation
two
in
finance
and
mr
du
pont
himself
the
executive
committee
thus
achieve
an
identity
with
the
operating
organization
which
under
one
title
or
another
it
have
maintain
ever
since
eventually
the
executive
committee
limited
itself
to
policy
matter
and
left
administration
to
the
president
now
the
question
of
the
relation
of
the
staff
line
and
general
officer
i
shall
describe
here
the
step
which
when
complete
put
form
into
the
organization
two
early
step
one
in
the
area
of
purchasing
the
other
in
advertising
assist
in
point
the
way
to
a
practical
form
of
organization
the
set
up
of
the
general
purchasing
committee
be
a
task
i
undertook
in
there
be
two
thing
about
this
committee
which
it
be
important
to
consider
one
be
its
value
or
lack
of
it
in
its
own
right
the
other
be
its
incidental
value
as
a
lesson
in
coordination
which
be
more
germane
to
the
story
here
centralize
purchasing
be
not
an
original
idea
with
us
in
those
day
it
be
consider
to
be
an
important
industrial
economy
and
in
some
circumstance
i
believe
it
be
i
have
experience
with
volume
economy
at
hyatt
as
a
supplier
to
ford
but
centralize
purchasing
in
which
a
single
purchasing
office
executes
contract
involve
more
than
one
division
of
an
enterprise
be
an
oversimplify
notion
as
we
discover
the
problem
for
general
motor
as
i
saw
it
in
be
to
get
the
advantage
of
volume
by
buying
on
general
contract
such
item
as
tire
steel
stationery
rag
battery
block
acetylene
abrasive
and
the
like
and
at
the
same
time
to
permit
the
division
to
have
control
over
their
own
affair
in
a
preliminary
memorandum
i
argue
that
coordination
of
purchasing
would
save
the
corporation
an
estimate
five
to
ten
million
dollar
a
year
that
it
would
make
it
easy
to
control
especially
to
reduce
inventory
that
in
an
emergency
one
division
could
obtain
material
from
another
and
that
the
corporation
s
purchasing
specialist
could
take
advantage
of
price
fluctuation
i
concede
however
the
peculiar
difficulty
that
arise
when
one
considers
the
extremely
technical
character
of
practically
all
the
corporation
s
product
and
recognizes
that
we
be
deal
with
many
personality
and
viewpoint
developed
through
year
of
contact
with
certain
product
as
compare
with
others
in
other
word
it
be
a
question
of
acknowledge
the
natural
constraint
of
decentralization
that
be
built
into
both
the
technology
of
the
product
and
the
mind
of
the
manager
the
latter
be
not
long
in
make
precisely
this
point
when
i
first
propose
to
have
a
purchasing
staff
do
the
coordinate
they
give
as
argument
their
long
experience
the
variety
of
their
requirement
and
the
loss
of
divisional
responsibility
in
an
area
which
could
affect
their
ability
to
carry
out
their
car
program
to
meet
these
objection
i
propose
the
general
purchasing
committee
with
a
membership
drawn
mostly
from
the
division
the
division
support
the
proposition
when
they
learn
that
they
would
be
represent
and
would
participate
in
decide
on
policy
and
procedure
for
purchasing
determine
specification
and
draw
up
contract
and
that
their
decision
in
the
committee
would
be
final
thus
it
be
arrange
that
in
the
committee
the
representative
of
the
division
have
the
opportunity
to
draw
the
balance
between
their
special
need
and
the
general
interest
a
corporation
purchasing
staff
be
to
administer
but
not
dictate
the
committee
s
decision
that
be
the
relation
of
committee
to
staff
be
to
be
that
of
principal
and
agent
the
purchasing
committee
last
about
ten
year
and
work
reasonably
well
during
that
time
but
a
number
of
limitation
on
its
value
arose
the
first
be
that
quantity
of
any
particular
product
need
for
one
division
be
generally
large
enough
to
justify
the
supplier
give
the
low
possible
price
to
that
division
the
second
be
the
question
of
administration
for
instance
if
the
corporation
make
a
contract
available
to
all
division
it
sometimes
happen
that
a
supplier
who
do
not
get
the
contract
would
go
to
one
of
the
division
and
make
a
low
price
even
though
he
have
participate
in
the
original
offering
that
would
cause
confusion
and
unhappiness
third
a
large
number
of
part
and
supply
to
be
purchase
have
no
common
denominator
they
be
special
item
applicable
to
a
particular
engineering
concept
therefore
i
think
the
general
purchasing
committee
itself
cannot
be
cite
as
an
unqualified
success
it
cause
us
however
to
make
a
strong
effort
to
standardize
article
where
possible
this
and
the
description
of
standardize
production
be
very
important
matter
the
general
purchasing
committee
s
real
and
last
success
be
in
the
area
of
standardization
of
material
also
this
committee
provide
our
first
lesson
in
coordination
it
be
our
first
experience
of
interdivisional
activity
combine
line
at
the
level
of
a
divisional
function
staff
a
general
purchasing
section
and
general
officer
i
be
the
first
chairman
of
the
committee
two
year
later
review
its
work
i
write
the
general
purchasing
committee
have
i
believe
show
the
way
and
have
demonstrate
that
those
responsible
for
each
functional
activity
can
work
together
to
their
own
profit
and
to
the
profit
of
the
stockholder
at
the
same
time
and
such
a
plan
of
coordination
be
far
well
from
every
standpoint
than
try
to
inject
it
into
the
operation
from
some
central
activity
the
next
significant
step
toward
coordination
be
in
the
area
of
advertising
i
have
have
some
consumer
study
make
in
and
we
found
that
people
throughout
the
united
state
except
at
the
corner
of
wall
and
broad
street
didn
t
know
anything
about
general
motor
so
i
thought
we
should
publicize
the
parent
company
a
plan
submit
to
me
by
barton
durstine
and
osborn
now
bbdo
be
approve
by
the
finance
committee
and
by
our
top
executive
but
since
divisional
matter
would
come
into
the
picture
i
ask
both
divisional
personnel
and
other
executive
in
detroit
for
their
viewpoint
on
the
propriety
of
such
a
program
it
be
agree
that
the
plan
be
worthwhile
and
bruce
barton
be
give
full
responsibility
for
conduct
the
campaign
we
then
form
the
institutional
advertising
committee
consist
of
car
division
manager
and
staff
men
to
assist
mr
barton
and
to
effect
the
necessary
coordination
with
other
phase
of
the
corporation
s
publicity
i
make
a
rule
that
if
any
advertising
theme
dealt
with
a
particular
division
it
must
have
the
approval
of
that
division
it
be
another
little
lesson
in
divisional
relationship
the
really
big
step
forward
in
coordination
however
follow
from
the
copper
cool
engine
experience
when
that
issue
be
conclude
with
the
party
to
it
divide
against
one
another
particularly
the
research
engineer
on
the
one
hand
and
the
divisional
engineer
on
the
other
something
have
to
be
do
to
heal
the
wound
and
to
resolve
this
fundamental
conflict
between
those
seek
new
concept
and
those
with
the
responsibility
for
produce
automobile
first
of
all
what
be
need
be
a
place
to
bring
these
men
together
under
amicable
circumstance
for
the
exchange
of
information
and
the
iron
out
of
difference
it
seem
to
me
preferable
that
such
a
meeting
of
mind
should
take
place
in
the
presence
of
the
general
executive
who
would
in
the
end
have
to
make
or
approve
the
big
decision
on
forward
program
rather
than
try
to
give
the
picture
wholly
through
recollection
in
which
it
might
well
be
suppose
that
i
would
share
in
the
human
fail
of
make
it
seem
more
logical
than
it
be
i
shall
quote
here
at
length
a
proposal
the
key
statement
i
believe
in
the
whole
affair
which
i
write
and
circulate
to
a
number
of
executive
of
the
corporation
and
obtain
approval
of
during
september
i
have
felt
for
a
long
time
past
that
if
a
proper
plan
could
be
developed
that
would
have
the
support
of
all
those
interested
that
a
great
deal
could
be
gain
for
the
corporation
by
cooperation
of
an
engineering
nature
between
our
various
operation
particularly
our
car
division
deal
as
they
do
in
so
many
problem
have
the
same
general
characteristic
activity
of
this
type
have
already
be
start
in
the
way
of
purchasing
and
have
be
very
helpful
and
i
be
confident
that
as
time
go
on
will
be
justified
in
a
great
many
different
way
beside
s
result
in
very
material
profit
to
the
corporation
the
activity
of
our
institutional
advertising
committee
have
be
constructive
and
mr
du
pont
remark
to
me
the
other
day
after
one
of
those
meeting
that
even
if
it
be
assume
that
the
value
of
the
advertising
be
negligible
the
other
benefit
accrue
to
the
corporation
by
the
development
of
a
general
motor
atmosphere
and
the
work
together
spirit
of
all
member
of
the
committee
represent
the
various
phase
of
the
corporation
s
activity
the
cost
be
well
justified
i
be
quite
confident
that
we
all
agree
as
to
these
principle
and
assume
that
be
the
case
and
there
be
no
reason
why
the
same
principle
do
not
apply
to
engineering
it
appear
to
me
to
be
well
worth
a
serious
attempt
to
put
the
principle
into
practical
operation
i
be
thoroughly
convince
that
it
can
be
make
a
wonderful
success
i
believe
therefore
that
we
should
at
this
time
establish
what
might
be
term
a
general
technical
committee
which
committee
would
have
certain
power
and
function
which
should
be
broadly
define
at
the
start
and
amplify
in
various
way
as
the
progress
of
the
work
seem
to
justify
before
attempt
to
outline
even
the
general
principle
upon
which
i
believe
a
start
could
be
make
i
think
it
should
be
very
clearly
set
forth
and
distinctly
understood
by
all
that
the
function
of
this
committee
would
not
in
any
event
be
to
deal
with
the
specific
engineering
activity
of
any
particular
operation
accord
to
general
motor
plan
of
organization
to
which
i
believe
we
all
heartily
subscribe
the
activity
of
any
specific
operation
be
under
the
absolute
control
of
the
general
manager
of
that
division
subject
only
to
very
broad
contact
with
the
general
officer
of
the
corporation
i
certainly
do
not
want
to
suggest
a
departure
even
to
the
slightest
degree
from
what
i
believe
to
be
so
thoroughly
sound
a
type
of
organization
on
the
contrary
i
do
believe
and
have
believe
for
a
long
time
that
one
of
the
great
problem
that
face
the
general
motor
corporation
be
to
add
to
its
present
plan
of
organization
some
method
by
which
the
advantage
of
the
corporation
as
a
whole
could
be
capitalize
to
the
far
benefit
of
the
stockholder
i
feel
that
a
proper
balance
can
and
must
necessarily
be
establish
in
the
course
of
time
between
the
activity
of
any
particular
operation
and
that
of
all
our
operation
together
and
as
i
see
the
picture
at
the
moment
no
well
way
or
even
as
good
a
way
have
yet
be
advanced
as
to
ask
those
member
of
each
organization
who
have
the
same
functional
relationship
to
get
together
and
decide
for
themselves
what
should
be
do
where
coordination
be
necessary
give
such
a
group
the
power
to
deal
with
the
problem
where
it
be
felt
that
the
power
can
be
constructively
apply
i
believe
that
such
a
plan
properly
developed
give
the
necessary
balance
between
each
operation
and
the
corporation
itself
and
will
result
in
all
the
advantage
of
coordinate
action
where
such
action
be
of
benefit
in
a
broader
way
without
in
any
sense
limit
the
initiative
of
independence
of
action
of
any
component
part
of
the
group
assume
that
this
be
correct
in
principle
i
might
set
forth
specifically
what
the
function
in
the
case
of
the
general
technical
committee
would
be
although
this
discussion
would
i
think
apply
equally
well
to
other
committee
deal
with
all
function
common
to
all
manufacturing
enterprise
the
committee
would
deal
in
problem
which
would
be
of
interest
to
all
division
and
would
in
deal
with
such
matter
largely
formulate
the
general
engineering
policy
of
the
corporation
the
committee
would
assume
the
function
of
the
already
constitute
patent
committee
which
would
be
discontinue
and
in
assume
these
function
would
have
the
authority
to
deal
with
patent
matter
already
vested
in
the
patent
committee
the
committee
would
not
as
to
principle
deal
with
the
specific
problem
of
any
individual
operation
each
function
of
that
operation
would
be
under
the
absolute
control
of
the
general
manager
of
that
division
it
be
to
be
note
that
the
function
of
the
patent
section
advisory
staff
differs
materially
from
that
of
any
other
staff
activity
and
be
in
a
sense
an
exception
to
general
motor
plan
of
organization
in
the
fact
that
all
patent
problem
come
directly
under
the
control
of
the
director
of
the
patent
section
in
other
word
all
patent
work
be
centralize
the
patent
procedure
provide
however
for
an
invention
committee
and
for
cooperation
with
the
director
of
the
patent
section
and
the
divide
under
certain
condition
of
responsibility
in
patent
matter
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
personnel
of
the
invention
committee
must
necessarily
largely
parallel
that
of
the
general
technical
committee
it
be
thought
advisable
to
consolidate
the
two
for
the
sake
of
simplification
there
be
also
to
be
consider
the
function
of
the
general
motor
research
corporation
at
dayton
i
feel
that
up
to
the
present
time
the
general
motor
corporation
have
fail
to
capitalize
what
might
be
capitalize
with
a
proper
system
of
administration
the
advantage
that
should
flow
from
an
organization
such
as
we
have
at
dayton
in
make
this
statement
i
feel
that
there
be
a
number
of
contribute
cause
the
most
important
be
a
lack
of
proper
administrative
policy
or
i
might
say
a
lack
of
get
together
which
it
be
hop
that
this
program
will
provide
not
only
as
just
state
for
well
coordination
with
the
research
corporation
but
well
coordination
also
among
the
operating
division
themselves
i
believe
that
we
would
all
agree
that
many
of
our
research
and
engineering
problem
in
dayton
can
only
be
capitalize
through
the
acceptance
and
commercialize
of
same
by
the
operating
division
i
fully
believe
that
a
more
intimate
contact
with
what
the
research
corporation
be
try
to
do
will
be
all
that
be
necessary
to
effect
the
desire
result
and
strengthen
the
whole
engineering
side
of
the
entire
general
motor
corporation
it
be
my
idea
that
the
general
technical
committee
should
be
independent
in
character
and
in
addition
to
develop
through
its
secretary
as
hereafter
described
a
program
for
its
meeting
which
it
be
believe
would
be
helpful
and
beneficial
to
all
the
member
of
the
committee
would
conduct
study
and
investigation
of
such
a
character
and
scope
as
its
judgment
would
dictate
as
desirable
and
for
that
purpose
would
use
the
facility
of
the
research
corporation
or
of
any
operating
division
or
of
any
outside
source
that
in
its
judgment
would
lead
to
the
most
beneficial
result
project
of
this
character
would
be
present
to
the
committee
by
any
member
of
the
committee
itself
by
the
research
corporation
or
by
any
member
of
the
general
motor
corporation
through
the
committee
s
secretary
begin
january
the
cost
of
operating
the
general
motor
corporation
will
be
under
the
control
of
a
budget
system
and
fund
will
be
provide
in
that
budget
to
cover
this
purpose
i
have
present
the
above
idea
at
an
operation
committee
meeting
of
which
all
the
general
manager
of
the
car
division
primarily
interested
in
this
matter
and
the
group
vice
president
be
member
and
they
all
seem
to
think
that
the
step
be
a
constructive
one
and
would
have
the
support
of
all
in
order
therefore
that
all
the
above
may
be
crystallize
in
a
few
principal
point
which
will
be
sufficient
to
form
a
start
point
i
propose
the
follow
that
cooperation
shall
be
establish
between
the
car
division
and
the
engineering
department
within
the
corporation
include
the
engineering
and
research
activity
of
the
general
motor
research
corporation
and
that
cooperation
shall
take
the
form
of
a
committee
to
be
establish
to
be
term
the
general
technical
committee
the
committee
will
consist
as
to
principle
of
the
chief
engineer
of
each
car
division
and
certain
additional
member
thus
form
the
general
technical
committee
become
the
high
advisory
body
on
engineering
in
the
corporation
it
brought
together
the
very
person
who
have
part
over
the
copper
cool
engine
the
divisional
chief
engineer
include
notably
mr
hunt
staff
engineer
include
notably
mr
kettering
and
a
number
of
the
general
officer
of
the
corporation
include
myself
as
the
committee
s
chairman
it
be
as
my
proposal
state
an
independent
staff
organization
with
its
own
secretary
and
budget
it
held
its
first
meeting
on
september
i
be
pleased
to
sit
among
those
fine
men
mr
kettering
who
have
the
research
responsibility
mr
hunt
who
have
a
production
engineering
responsibility
at
chevrolet
henry
crane
who
be
my
assistant
on
engineering
matter
and
the
others
all
of
whom
met
in
a
friendly
atmosphere
and
enter
afresh
into
the
future
development
of
the
automobile
the
general
technical
committee
raise
the
prestige
of
the
engineering
group
in
the
corporation
and
support
its
effort
to
acquire
more
adequate
facility
and
personnel
its
activity
emphasize
the
importance
of
product
integrity
as
the
basic
requirement
for
the
future
success
of
the
business
it
have
a
remarkable
effect
in
stimulate
interest
and
action
everywhere
in
the
corporation
in
matter
of
product
appeal
and
product
improvement
and
produce
a
free
exchange
of
new
and
progressive
idea
and
experience
among
division
engineer
in
short
it
coordinate
information
a
number
of
specific
function
be
give
to
the
general
technical
committee
for
a
while
it
dealt
with
patent
matter
but
these
be
soon
turn
over
to
a
special
new
device
committee
more
important
be
the
committee
s
role
as
a
kind
of
board
of
director
of
the
great
new
prove
ground
that
we
built
at
milford
michigan
test
have
clearly
become
a
crucial
question
for
the
future
of
our
product
the
prove
ground
with
its
control
condition
be
the
logical
step
away
from
test
on
public
road
which
the
industry
up
to
that
time
have
practice
the
committee
saw
to
it
that
the
prove
ground
developed
standardize
test
procedure
and
measure
equipment
and
that
it
become
the
corporation
s
center
for
make
independent
comparison
of
division
product
and
the
product
of
competition
although
engine
test
be
not
assign
to
the
prove
ground
the
committee
be
charge
with
develop
an
engine
test
code
that
would
produce
uniformity
in
the
engine
test
practice
of
the
various
division
and
yet
the
general
technical
committee
be
the
mild
kind
of
organization
its
most
important
role
be
that
of
a
study
group
it
get
to
be
know
as
a
seminar
its
meeting
usually
be
open
with
the
reading
of
one
or
two
paper
on
a
specific
engineering
problem
or
device
and
these
would
then
be
the
center
of
a
general
discussion
sometimes
the
committee
s
discussion
would
conclude
with
the
approval
of
a
new
device
or
method
or
a
recommendation
on
engineering
policy
and
procedure
but
more
often
the
result
be
simply
that
information
be
transmit
from
one
to
all
the
member
return
to
their
division
with
a
broader
understand
of
new
development
and
current
problem
of
automotive
engineering
and
with
knowledge
of
what
their
associate
in
other
area
of
the
corporation
be
do
in
its
report
paper
and
discussion
the
general
technical
committee
study
such
short
range
engineering
problem
as
those
concern
brake
fuel
consumption
lubrication
change
require
in
the
steer
mechanism
as
a
result
of
the
development
of
four
wheel
brake
and
balloon
tire
this
lead
to
a
subcommittee
confer
with
the
rubber
company
and
the
condensation
of
product
of
combustion
that
result
in
internal
rust
and
oil
sludge
which
be
finally
eliminate
by
proper
crankcase
ventilation
in
and
the
committee
give
attention
to
the
education
of
the
dealer
and
sale
department
on
the
advertising
and
sale
value
of
current
engineering
development
i
ask
the
committee
to
develop
a
series
of
criterion
by
which
car
value
of
the
different
make
and
model
might
be
objectively
determine
in
too
i
give
the
committee
the
task
of
set
up
the
broad
specification
of
the
different
car
to
assist
in
our
effort
to
keep
the
several
general
motor
car
distinct
and
separate
product
and
in
a
proper
price
and
cost
relationship
to
one
another
mr
kettering
s
staff
make
most
of
the
long
range
investigation
and
submit
most
of
the
report
during
the
early
year
of
the
committee
they
discuss
such
matter
as
control
of
cylinder
wall
temperature
cylinder
head
sleeve
valve
engine
intake
manifold
tetraethyl
lead
for
gasoline
and
transmission
fundamentally
the
subject
matter
be
fuel
and
metallurgy
the
two
area
which
have
furnish
the
most
important
improvement
in
the
performance
of
the
automobile
since
that
time
a
meeting
on
september
in
which
the
subject
of
transmission
be
consider
be
a
good
example
of
the
committee
at
work
i
rely
on
the
minute
for
this
description
mr
kettering
begin
by
describe
the
relative
merit
and
demerit
of
various
type
of
transmission
this
be
follow
by
a
long
discussion
on
the
practicality
of
the
inertia
type
transmission
from
an
engineering
standpoint
mr
hunt
discuss
the
different
type
from
the
commercial
angle
the
grow
traffic
problem
he
say
be
call
for
a
car
which
have
real
acceleration
and
in
addition
it
have
to
have
real
brake
after
some
give
and
take
around
the
table
i
close
this
part
of
the
meeting
by
say
i
take
it
that
the
sentiment
of
the
committee
be
something
like
this
first
that
we
should
look
to
the
ultimate
which
be
directly
a
research
problem
and
that
the
inertia
type
transmission
be
the
one
which
offer
the
great
possibility
this
be
strictly
a
research
problem
should
not
the
committee
charge
mr
kettering
with
do
everything
possible
toward
its
development
second
for
the
present
we
must
have
minimum
inertia
and
minimum
friction
in
our
clutch
and
transmission
element
at
our
various
division
and
this
problem
be
their
own
the
inertia
type
transmission
do
appear
to
have
great
possibility
technically
but
in
actual
performance
it
do
not
prove
to
be
sufficiently
smooth
or
long
live
to
warrant
production
in
such
manner
we
separate
the
function
of
the
research
corporation
from
that
of
the
division
the
division
in
those
day
however
also
have
long
term
project
chevrolet
for
example
developed
a
six
cylinder
low
price
car
that
summer
i
write
mr
kettering
about
a
session
of
the
technical
committee
in
oshawa
canada
this
passage
give
the
general
idea
we
have
a
splendid
meeting
not
only
so
far
as
the
meeting
itself
go
but
the
boy
stayed
over
saturday
and
some
of
them
sunday
and
some
go
fishing
and
others
played
golf
and
that
help
a
lot
in
bring
men
who
be
think
in
the
same
direction
more
closely
together
i
can
t
help
but
feel
consider
the
magnitude
of
our
picture
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
that
this
cooperation
in
engineering
be
work
out
just
splendidly
we
must
be
patient
but
i
be
sure
that
as
time
go
on
we
be
go
to
be
fully
repaid
for
the
way
we
have
handle
it
as
compare
with
a
more
military
style
which
i
do
not
think
would
have
ever
put
us
anywhere
the
interdivisional
committee
try
in
a
rudimentary
way
in
purchasing
and
advertising
and
apply
more
intensively
in
the
general
technical
committee
be
the
first
big
idea
for
coordination
in
the
corporation
we
go
on
from
the
general
technical
committee
to
apply
the
concept
to
most
of
the
principal
functional
activity
of
the
division
the
next
interdivisional
committee
to
be
form
be
in
sale
the
sale
area
be
relatively
unexplored
for
the
industry
in
the
mid
twenty
for
the
first
time
have
enter
its
commercial
phase
i
therefore
arrange
to
set
up
the
general
sale
committee
make
up
of
the
sale
manager
of
the
car
and
truck
division
sale
staff
member
and
general
officer
of
the
corporation
as
its
chairman
i
open
its
first
meeting
on
march
with
the
follow
remark
while
general
motor
be
definitely
commit
to
a
decentralize
plan
of
operation
it
be
nevertheless
obvious
that
from
time
to
time
general
plan
and
policy
beneficial
to
the
corporation
and
its
stockholder
as
well
as
to
the
individual
division
can
best
be
accomplish
through
concert
effort
the
necessity
for
concert
action
on
the
broader
phase
of
our
activity
be
emphasize
by
the
likelihood
of
some
of
our
competitor
merge
their
interest
perhaps
in
the
near
future
this
as
you
know
be
the
trend
of
the
industry
narrow
profit
will
add
impetus
to
such
a
tendency
and
under
the
highly
competitive
condition
of
the
near
future
we
may
expect
a
decidedly
different
situation
in
the
field
general
motor
as
you
know
have
make
quite
a
lot
of
progress
in
line
up
its
product
into
different
price
group
which
relatively
speak
be
non
competitive
from
the
standpoint
of
design
and
manufacture
we
have
through
the
cooperation
of
our
division
manager
and
engineer
make
wonderful
progress
in
the
direction
of
coordination
much
be
to
be
gain
through
a
similar
coordination
of
sale
activity
i
think
that
we
in
general
motor
have
all
get
to
recognize
that
the
neck
of
the
bottle
be
go
to
be
the
sale
end
this
be
perfectly
natural
in
any
industry
it
eventually
get
down
to
the
sale
end
and
certainly
the
automotive
industry
be
begin
to
reach
that
period
if
it
have
not
already
arrive
it
be
our
idea
that
this
committee
will
take
in
hand
all
those
major
sale
problem
which
a
ffect
the
corporation
as
a
whole
it
be
your
committee
you
can
feel
perfectly
free
to
bring
up
any
sale
problem
that
seem
to
require
general
discussion
and
concert
effort
whatever
general
policy
or
action
you
may
decide
upon
will
be
fully
support
by
the
parent
corporation
we
should
i
believe
confine
our
discussion
in
these
meeting
to
problem
of
common
interest
a
ffecting
all
division
realize
that
all
of
you
men
be
extremely
busy
we
will
try
to
keep
away
from
detail
deal
only
with
the
basic
problem
we
will
do
everything
in
our
power
to
make
the
session
businesslike
and
to
the
point
no
time
will
be
take
to
prepare
paper
etc
unless
in
some
instance
you
may
wish
it
that
way
mr
b
g
koether
director
sale
section
will
serve
as
secretary
of
the
committee
he
have
a
staff
which
can
be
expand
if
necessary
and
whose
service
be
entirely
at
your
command
we
have
not
developed
any
definite
program
for
these
meeting
because
we
want
to
leave
such
matter
to
you
realize
that
you
be
in
a
well
position
to
know
just
what
problem
require
the
most
urgent
attention
and
while
we
may
suggest
a
number
of
thing
from
time
to
time
it
be
entirely
up
to
you
to
act
upon
such
suggestion
as
you
may
see
fit
the
chairmanship
of
the
general
sale
committee
be
later
give
to
donaldson
brown
vice
president
of
finance
because
of
the
bearing
of
statistical
and
financial
control
on
production
and
sale
problem
coordination
in
sale
thus
extend
to
the
financial
staff
after
a
study
of
the
interdivisional
type
of
committee
by
mr
pratt
in
late
confirm
in
the
mind
of
everyone
that
this
be
the
best
form
of
coordination
we
have
found
up
to
that
time
it
be
make
more
or
less
official
and
be
extend
to
work
manager
and
the
power
and
maintenance
staff
something
of
the
same
sort
of
coordination
be
extend
to
the
very
top
level
of
management
but
with
a
difference
the
reader
will
recall
that
under
mr
durant
the
executive
committee
be
compose
largely
of
division
manager
who
campaign
there
for
the
interest
of
their
respective
division
when
we
form
the
new
temporary
executive
committee
of
four
we
place
the
former
member
mainly
the
division
manager
in
an
advisory
operation
committee
for
some
time
while
the
emergency
be
be
liquidate
this
advisory
committee
be
not
regularly
active
after
i
become
president
and
the
executive
committee
be
enlarge
again
it
include
at
different
time
one
or
two
division
manager
depend
on
circumstance
or
motivate
by
the
thought
that
the
large
car
division
should
have
representation
there
but
these
be
exception
not
the
rule
for
i
believe
in
principle
that
the
top
operating
committee
should
be
a
policy
group
detach
from
the
interest
of
specific
division
in
other
word
it
should
contain
only
general
executive
hold
this
view
after
i
become
president
i
felt
that
something
should
be
do
to
bring
the
general
manager
into
contact
in
a
regular
way
with
the
member
of
the
top
operating
policy
group
i
therefore
reactivate
the
operation
committee
and
have
place
on
it
all
the
general
operating
officer
on
the
executive
committee
and
the
general
manager
of
the
principal
division
thus
make
it
the
major
point
of
regular
contact
between
the
two
type
of
executive
the
operation
committee
be
not
a
policy
make
body
but
a
forum
for
the
discussion
of
policy
or
of
need
for
policy
the
operation
committee
would
receive
a
full
set
of
data
on
the
performance
of
the
corporation
and
would
review
that
performance
the
word
forum
may
suggest
something
idle
but
i
assure
you
that
in
this
case
it
do
not
mean
that
in
a
large
enterprise
some
mean
be
necessary
to
bring
about
a
common
understand
it
be
perhaps
sufficient
to
note
that
with
all
of
the
member
of
the
top
operating
policy
group
present
an
agreement
on
a
policy
suggest
say
by
a
division
manager
would
be
tantamount
to
acceptance
on
the
operating
side
of
the
corporation
in
sum
then
the
whole
picture
of
coordination
in
and
for
a
number
of
year
thereafter
be
as
follow
the
interdivisional
relation
committee
give
a
measure
of
coordination
to
the
function
of
purchasing
engineering
sale
and
the
like
the
operation
committee
include
the
general
manager
appraise
the
performance
of
the
division
the
executive
committee
with
contact
in
all
direction
make
policy
it
sat
at
the
head
of
operation
responsible
to
the
board
of
director
indeed
it
be
a
committee
of
the
board
but
beholden
to
the
finance
committee
for
its
large
appropriation
on
the
operating
side
the
executive
committee
be
supreme
its
chairman
be
the
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
corporation
and
he
have
all
the
authority
he
need
to
carry
out
establish
policy
this
be
the
new
general
motor
scheme
of
management
from
which
development
down
to
this
day
through
much
evolution
have
be
derive
chapter
the
development
of
financial
control
the
development
of
coordination
by
committee
in
the
early
s
be
accompany
by
coordination
of
another
order
namely
that
of
financial
control
general
motor
progress
i
believe
be
largely
the
result
of
advance
the
corporation
make
in
this
area
of
management
along
with
those
in
organization
and
product
policy
our
modern
financial
policy
like
those
in
organization
come
out
of
the
ruin
of
for
the
lead
member
of
the
new
administration
that
take
over
the
corporation
the
necessity
of
provide
new
form
of
financial
control
be
doctrine
the
question
be
what
they
should
be
and
how
to
put
them
into
effect
the
specific
form
of
financial
control
in
general
motor
be
introduce
in
good
part
by
donaldson
brown
who
come
to
general
motor
from
the
du
pont
company
at
the
begin
of
and
albert
bradley
his
young
associate
who
come
to
general

in
and
who
be
to
succeed
mr
brown
as
the
top
financial
officer
and
later
to
succeed
me
as
chairman
of
the
board
their
contribution
to
financial
thought
have
long
be
recognize
they
write
paper
on
the
subject
which
be
classic
of
the
s
and
at
the
same
time
put
their
concept
into
practice
in
general
motor
frederic
g
donner
present
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
george
russell
executive
vice
president
and
other
gift
member
of
the
financial
staff
rise
out
of
this
great
school
of
finance
to
make
their
own
contribution
in
their
long
service
to
the
corporation
although
i
write
on
the
subject
of
finance
in
the
form
of
report
particularly
in
connection
with
interdivisional
business
and
appropriation
my
experience
be
mainly
from
the
operating
side
my
responsibility
involve
the
application
of
financial
method
for
finance
could
not
exist
in
a
vacuum
but
have
to
be
integrate
with
operation
i
think
i
have
make
clear
that
mr
durant
have
no
systematic
financial
methodology
it
be
not
his
way
of
do
business
and
yet
modern
financial
concept
be
brought
into
general
motor
during
his
administration
mr
durant
be
instrumental
in
arrange
for
the
du
pont
executive
to
come
on
the
finance
committee
and
take
the
responsibility
for
that
aspect
of
the
corporation
s
affair
i
believe
the
outstanding
benefit
general
motor
derive
from
the
du
pont
association
apart
from
their
general
position
as
a
responsible
shareholder
serve
on
the
board
of
director
be
in
the
financial
area
a
number
of
du
pont
men
experienced
in
accounting
and
finance
come
to
general
motor
in
the
early
year
and
assume
key
position
mr
brown
be
one
of
these
men
a
word
on
his
background
as
he
have
told
it
to
me
he
be
in
the
sale
department
of
the
du
pont
company
for
a
number
of
year
during
the
early
part
of
this
century
in
he
be
take
into
the
office
of
one
of
the
du
pont
general
manager
as
an
assistant
without
portfolio
that
be
when
coleman
du
pont
be
president
of
the
du
pont
company
the
general
manager
of
this
department
be
handicapped
seriously
by
bad
health
and
have
to
be
out
of
the
office
for
a
period
at
that
time
the
du
pont
executive
committee
be
seek
a
realistic
report
on
the
efficiency
of
the
operating
department
of
the
company
then
engage
almost
wholly
in
manufacturing
explosive
blasting
powder
dynamite
and
the
like
mr
brown
take
upon
himself
the
job
of
develop
a
method
to
reveal
the
desire
fact
about
the
several
activity
under
the
general
manager
the
method
he
chose
emphasize
the
importance
of
capital
turnover
as
well
as
profit
margin
in
calculate
return
on
investment
mr
brown
pass
his
report
on
to
the
chief
executive
and
it
make
such
an
impression
on
coleman
du
pont
that
he
recommend
that
mr
brown
be
transfer
to
the
finance
department
pierre
s
du
pont
be
then
treasurer
and
mr
raskob
be
assistant
treasurer
mr
raskob
make
mr
brown
the
junior
assistant
treasurer
very
junior
mr
brown
say
i
guess
he
be
with
mr
raskob
around
but
eventually
mr
raskob
succeed
mr
du
pont
as
treasurer
and
mr
brown
succeed
mr
raskob
in
that
post
when
mr
raskob
go
into
general
motor
mr
brown
brought
economist
and
statistician
into
the
du
pont
company
a
practice
that
be
unusual
in
those
day
thereafter
when
the
du
pont
executive
committee
met
with
the
du
pont
general
manager
mr
brown
displayed
chart
on
the
efficiency
of
divisional
performance
a
technique
of
presentation
which
he
initiate
at
mr
raskob
s
request
mr
brown
come
to
general
motor
on
january
as
vice
president
in
charge
of
finance
he
and
i
share
similar
view
on
the
value
of
detailed
discipline
control
in
the
operation
of
a
business
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
in
the
corporation
we
recognize
this
affinity
and
begin
a
long
and
congenial
relationship
the
du
pont
group
after
come
into
the
corporation
in
have
make
an
effort
to
apply
the
principle
of
return
on
investment
in
appropriate
fund
to
the
operating
side
of
the
corporation
yet
mr
raskob
though
he
have
the
right
idea
in
general
be
not
prepared
with
the
instrumentation
for
general
motor
i
have
described
in
an
earlier
chapter
how
during
the
expansion
of
difficulty
arose
owe
to
the
loose
manner
in
which
appropriation
be
make
and
how
the
inventory
runaway
and
shortage
of
cash
brought
crisis
to
the
corporation
in
the
slump
of
these
three
emergency
problem
overrun
on
appropriation
inventory
runaway
and
the
result
cash
shortage
expose
the
lack
of
control
and
coordination
in
the
corporation
it
be
in
the
effort
to
meet
these
specific
emergency
problem
that
new
method
of
financial
coordination
and
control
be
developed
in
general
motor
financial
method
be
so
refine
today
that
it
may
seem
routine
yet
this
method
the
financial
model
as
some
call
it
by
organize
and
present
the
significant
fact
about
what
be
go
on
in
and
around
a
business
be
one
of
the
chief
base
for
strategic
business
decision
at
all
time
and
particularly
in
time
of
crisis
or
of
contraction
or
expansion
from
whatever
cause
it
be
of
the
essence
in
the
run
of
a
business
the
situation
in
prove
this
negatively
and
we
be
to
prove
it
positively
in
the
subsequent
critical
year
i
have
related
how
in
and
in
the
absence
of
a
system
for
control
of
appropriation
each
division
manager
get
his
maximum
request
satisfied
without
real
effort
on
the
part
of
the
corporation
to
evaluate
the
request
or
to
reconcile
the
total
amount
of
all
request
with
the
available
fund
this
together
with
overrun
on
appropriation
and
the
inventory
rise
represent
a
drain
on
available
fund
which
have
to
be
met
in
some
way
to
get
the
money
we
sell
common
stock
debenture
stock
and
prefer
stock
though
not
so
easily
or
in
such
amount
as
we
expect
and
before
the
year
be
out
we
have
to
borrow
about
million
from
bank
from
then
through
we
charge
against
income
of
the
corporation
about
million
for
extraordinary
write
offs
inventory
adjustment
and
liquidation
loss
an
amount
equal
to
about
one
sixth
of
the
total
asset
of
the
corporation
financial
control
at
this
juncture
be
not
merely
desirable
it
be
a
necessity
to
survive
we
have
to
pull
back
from
the
brink
and
find
a
general
solution
the
story
of
how
we
do
it
fall
into
two
part
the
first
part
concern
how
the
corporation
curtail
the
excessive
freedom
of
the
division
which
have
go
so
far
as
to
jeopardize
the
survival
of
the
corporation
and
how
we
establish
control
over
them
the
immediate
remedy
inevitably
be
centralize
in
character
for
the
corporation
could
not
afford
to
let
its
division
continue
to
make
the
kind
of
mistake
they
be
make
the
weak
division
threaten
the
existence
of
the
strong
one
and
the
strong
one
themselves
be
operate
more
for
their
own
than
the
corporation
s
interest
these
centralize
remedy
largely
operating
control
create
a
temporary
distortion
in
our
general
policy
which
later
have
to
be
correct
in
order
to
return
to
a
workable
decentralization
the
second
part
of
the
story
involves
the
development
of
the
financial
instrument
which
make
it
possible
to
establish
decentralization
with
coordinate
control

corporate
control
appropriation
for

just
before
the
economic
collapse
of
that
be
in
june
of
that
year
the

on
appropriation

which
have
be
form
at
the
end
of
and
of
which
i
be
chairman
give
its
report
to
the
executive
committee
this
report
prepared
by
mr
pratt
mr
prentis
and
myself
mark
a
historic
turn
point
in
the
development
of
appropriation
procedure
in
general
motor
the
core
of
our
concept
lay
in
the
determination
of
the
propriety
of
propose
project
four
principle
be
to
be
satisfied
which
we
state
as

a

the
project

logical
or
necessary
one

as
a
commercial
venture

the
project
be
properly
developed
technically
c

the
project
proper

the
interest
of
the
corporation
as
a

what
be
the
relative
value
of
the
project
to
the
corporation
as
compare
with
other
project
under
consideration
from
the
standpoint
not
only
of
the
return
on
the
necessary
capital
to
be
invest
but
of
the
need
of
the
particular
project
in
support
the
operation
of
the
corporation
as
a
whole
bearing
down
on
the
main
weakness
of
the
corporation
in
this
area
at
that
time
we
say
in
the
report
a
very
careful
consideration
of
the
subject
on
the
part
of
your
committee
lead
it
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
at
least
so
far
as
the
large
project
be
concerned
an
independent
impartial
review
and
check
of
all
phase
of
the
propose
project
outside
of
the
division
or
subsidiary
itself
be
essential
and
will
be
found
more
and
more
so
as
time
develops
and
the
operation
of
the
corporation
become
more
interwoven
and
complex
this
procedure
require
a
review
by
an
appropriation
committee
before
submission
of
a
request
to
the
executive
committee
or
finance
committee
for
approval
and
a
policy
review
by
the
latter
committee
we
define
the
scope
of
their
review
as
follow
it
appear
to
your
committee
that
the
member
of
such
committee
executive
and
finance
should
be
interested
in
the
project
as
a
matter
of
general
policy
and
that
their
passing
of
such
project
should
be
a
matter
of
financial
return
or
necessity
of
the
project
to
the
general
development
of
the
corporation
rather
than
from
the
standpoint
of
the
particular
type
of
lathe
or
milling
machine
or
how
many
such
lathe
or
milling
machine
be
essential
to
the
proper
development
of
the
propose
project
follow
this
line
of
reason
we
allow
certain
small
amount
of
expenditure
to
be
authorize
by
the
general
manager
of
a
division
on
his
own
for
large
amount
we
propose
a
detailed
procedure
on
the
development
and
follow
up
of
support
data
and
in
this
connection
we
propose
to
bring
together
the
two
main
branch
of
the
corporation
your
committee
recognizes
the
necessity
of
determine
proper
coordination
between
the
financial
and
operating
staff
as
regard
expenditure
and
to
be
specific
we
recommend
that
an
appropriation
manual
be
developed
for
the
corporation
set
forth
in
detail
the
kind
of
information
the
division
and
subsidiary
should
present
to
demonstrate
the
desirability
of
a
propose
expenditure
both
from
an
engineering
and
an
economic
standpoint
the
executive
committee
approve
our
recommendation
in
september
and
request
that
the
manual
be
prepared
this
manual
approve
by
the
executive
and
finance
committee
in
april
establish
the
first
well
define
capital
appropriation
procedure
in
general
motor
it
call
for
an
appropriation
committee
function
under
both
the
finance
and
executive
committee
to
have
general
charge
of
all
appropriation
matter
and
coordinate
program
involve
more
than
one
division
the
division
be
to
make
monthly
report
of
construction
in
progress
to
the
appropriation
committee
which
in
turn
would
present
a
combine
report
each
month
to
the
finance
committee
each
appropriation
request
be
to
receive
consideration
and
analysis
from
a
corporation
as
well
as
a
divisional
standpoint
before
any
commitment
be
make
proper
record
be
to
be
kept
of
expenditure
and
approval
for
expenditure
and
uniform
treatment
be
to
be
give
to
appropriation
request
throughout
the
corporation
in
short
we
be
for
the
first
time
to
get
accurate
and
orderly
information
after
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
business
judgment
whether
to
grant
a
request
change
in
this
procedure
have
be
make
from
time
to
time
and
an
appropriation
committee
as
such
be
discontinue
long
ago
however
in
its
essential
this
be
still
the
way
capital
appropriation
be
approve
in
general
motor
cash
control
we
be
short
of
cash
in
because
we
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
the
future
and
do
not
take
in
enough
in
the
present
hence
the
bank
borrowing
which
reach
a
maximum
of
about
million
at
the
end
of
october
of
that
year
for
some
time
afterward
cash
be
a
question
of
conservation
the
way
cash
be
handle
at
that
time
be
almost
unbelievable
each
division
control
its
own
cash
deposit
all
receipt
in
its
own
account
and
pay
all
bill
from
those
same
account
since
only
the
division
sell
product
none
of
these
cash
receipt
flow
directly
to
the
corporation
itself
we
have
no
effective
procedure
for
get
cash
from
the
point
where
we
happen
to
have
some
to
the
point
where
we
happen
to
need
some
when
the
corporation
as
an
operating
company
have
to
pay
dividend
and
tax
and
such
item
as
rent
salary
and
other
expense
of
the
general
staff
the
usual
procedure
be
for
the
treasurer
to
request
cash
from
the
division
that
be
not
so
simple
as
it
sound
however
for
the
division
operating
independently
try
to
keep
their
cash
balance
high
enough
to
satisfy
their
own
peak
requirement
therefore
when
they
have
more
cash
than
they
need
at
the
moment
they
be
not
eager
to
turn
it
over
to
the
corporation
i
remember
that
buick
for
example
at
that
time
be
very
loath
to
give
up
its
cash
this
profitable
division
be
of
course
the
most
prolific
source
of
cash
for
the
corporation
and
long
experience
have
make
buick
s
financial
staff
highly
adept
at
delay
its
report
of
the
cash
they
have
on
hand
buick
make
a
practice
of
maintain
large
cash
balance
in
its
factory
sale
branch
the
amount
of
these
balance
be
not
ascertainable
at
headquarters
until
buick
have
submit
its
monthly
financial
statement
for
the
division
as
a
whole
and
this
be
usually
a
month
or
two
after
the
fact
when
the
corporation
need
cash
the
treasurer
meyer
prentis
would
try
to
guess
how
much
buick
actually
have
and
how
much
of
it
he
could
probably
get
from
them
then
he
would
go
to
flint
discus
whatever
other
question
might
be
outstanding
between
buick
and
headquarters
and
at
last
casually
bring
up
the
subject
of
cash
buick
s
financial
people
would
invariably
express
surprise
at
the
size
of
mr
prentis
request
and
occasionally
would
try
to
resist
the
transfer
of
such
a
large
amount
naturally
this
cat
and
mouse
game
do
not
result
in
the
most
efficient
utilization
of
fund
especially
when
some
division
have
more
operating
cash
than
they
need
at
the
same
time
that
other
division
be
short
of
operating
cash
in
we
change
all
this
by
set
up
a
consolidated
cash
control
system
this
be
a
new
concept
for
a
large
corporation
depository
account
be
establish
in
some
one
hundred
bank
in
the
united
state
and
all
incoming
receipt
be
deposit
in
these
account
to
the
credit
of
general
motor
corporation
all
withdrawal
from
them
be
administer
by
the
central
financial
staff
the
division
have
no
control
over
cash
transfer
from
these
deposit
account
under
this
system
transfer
between
bank
could
be
make
quickly
and
automatically
the
financial
staff
of
the
corporation
set
fix
minimum
and
maximum
balance
for
these
local
deposit
account
base
on
the
size
of
the
bank
and
the
activity
of
the
account
whenever
the
amount
in
any
one
account
rise
above
the
maximum
the
excess
over
the
fix
minimum
be
automatically
transfer
by
federal
reserve
telegraph
to
one
of
a
number
of
central
reservoir
bank
the
account
in
these
reservoir
bank
be
also
administer
by
the
financial
staff
division
need
cash
for
their
own
requirement
could
apply
to
headquarters
for
transfer
by
telegraph
in
two
or
three
hour
excess
fund
in
one
city
could
be
make
available
to
a
division
need
them
in
another
city
at
the
other
end
of
the
country
cash
in
transit
also
be
reduce
by
put
an
end
to
cash
payment
between
division
we
set
up
an
intracorporation
settlement
procedure
under
which
the
financial
staff
at
headquarters
act
as
a
clearinghouse
for
the
settlement
of
interdivisional
claim
and
payment
intracorporation
settlement
certificate
be
exchange
instead
of
cash
at
this
time
too
we
begin
calculate
a
month
ahead
what
our
cash
would
be
each
day
of
the
month
take
into
account
the
sale
schedule
payroll
payment
for
material
and
the
like
against
this
project
curve
we
compare
each
day
the
corporation
s
actual
cash
balance
a
divergence
of
the
actual
curve
from
the
project
curve
would
be
the
signal
to
find
the
reason
for
such
divergence
and
to
take
corrective
action
at
the
appropriate
level
of
operation
a
side
effect
of
the
new
cash
system
be
that
it
broaden
the
supply
of
credit
available
to
general
motor
by
establish
good
work
relationship
with
a
large
number
of
bank
we
be
able
to
develop
extensive
line
of
credit
which
could
be
drawn
on
if
the
need
arose
by
reduce
our
cash
balance
in
bank
this
system
also
enable
us
to
invest
the
excess
cash
principally
in
short
term
government
security
thus
we
earn
an
income
on
money
formerly
kept
as
cash
and
so
increase
the
efficiency
with
which
we
use
our
capital
a
number
of
people
contribute
to
the
creation
of
the
cash
plan
the
need
for
it
be
see
by
mr
raskob
he
request
the
preparation
of
the
plan
from
mr
prentis
who
with
the
assistance
of
many
others
draft
its
broad
outline
in
general
the
technique
they
developed
be
still
use
by
general
motor
to
control
cash
inventory
control
the
bad
of
the
emergency
problem
be
the
inventory
i
have
related
how
uncontrolled
purchase
of
raw
and
semifinished

have
reach
a

by
october
of
exceed
the
executive

finance
committee
maximum
allotment
by
million
and
far
exceed
the
amount
that
could
immediately
be
use
in
the
plant
and
how
the
finance
committee
on
a
temporary
emergency
basis
have
take
control
of
inventory
away
from
the
operating

and
on
october
appoint
an
inventory
committee
head
by
mr

who
be
on
mr

have
a
large
responsibility

work
on
the
same
floor
and
be
in
touch
with
each
other
on
all
the
problem
that
come
up
mr
pratt
be
you
might
say
a
stand
in
for
me
when
i
be
president
he
have
a
great
capability
for
handle
large
problem
with
plainness
and
simplicity
he
could
get
to
the
point
the
first
step
of
the
inventory
committee
in
the
crisis
of
mr
pratt
later
write
to
mr
raskob
be
to
send
out
under

letter
instruct
all
general
manager
to
buy
nothing
to
stop
shipment
of
all

release
until
the
inventory
committee
could
review
the
situation
with
each
individual
general
manager
and
decide
on
what
material
would
be
receive
and
what
would
not
be
receive
most
of
the
work
be
do
by
sit
down
with
the
general
manager
in
their
own
office
and
go
over
their
inventory
situation
with
them
in
detail
the
general
manager
negotiate
with
the
supplier
and
i
know
of
only
one
instance
in
the
tractor
business
not
in
the
automobile
business
in
which
there
be
litigation
then
the
division
be
put
under
a
system
of
control
the
original
memorandum
by
mr
pratt
described
the
procedure
as
follow
after
the
flow
of
incoming
material
be
stop
each
general
manager
submit
a
monthly
budget
to
the
inventory
committee
which
show
estimate
sale
for
the
next
four
month
and
the
estimate
material
and
payroll
that
would
be
require
for
production
to
meet
the
estimate
sale
these
budget
be
carefully
scan
by
the
inventory
committee
and
discuss
with
the
general
manager
and
when
an
agreement
have
be
reach
material
for
one
month
s
production
at
a
time
be
release
by
the
inventory
committee
in
this
way
they
gain
control
over
runaway
inventory
reduce
them
and
conserve
cash
for
example
the
level
of
inventory
be
reduce
from
the
high
of
million
at
the
end
of
september
to
a
low
of
million
at
the
end
of
june
and
the
turnover
of
inventory
be
increase
from
about
twice
a
year
in
september
to
over
four
time
in
june
mr
bradley
have
observe
to
me
that
the
essential
thing
we
learn
from
this
experience
be
that
the
only
way
to
cut
back
inventory
particularly
in
a
time
of
decline
business
be
to
reduce
purchase
and
commitment
for
material
and
supply
obvious
not
entirely
anyway
it
take
us
a
long
time
to
learn
this
from
experience
in
those
day
the
general
manager
tend
to
be
optimist
as
most
executive
in
the
sell
end
of
the
automobile
business
be
and
perhaps
still
be
they
always
expect
that
sale
would
increase
and
thereby
bring
the
inventory
in
line
when
the
expect
sale
fail
to
materialize
a
problem
arose
to
which
there
could
be
no
entirely
pleasant
solution
hence
we
learn
to
be
skeptical
of
expectation
of
increase
future
sale
as
a
solution
to
a
rise
inventory
problem
we
take
the
position
that
actual
inventory
purchase
and
commitment
should
be
reduce
know
that
we
could
increase
them
later
if
that
be
warrant
by
actual
sale
the
emergency
measure
i
have
described
establish
that
the
corporation
be
in
charge
of
the
corporation
so
to
speak
but
centralization
of
this
kind
be
not
in
accord
with
our
idea
for
permanent
way
of
do
business
in
general
motor
we
soon
turn
again
toward
decentralization
donaldson
brown
propose
a
long
range
policy
of
inventory
control
in
a
report
to
the
finance
committee
on
april
as
follow
it
be
believe
that
the
emergency
which
exist
at
the
time
the
inventory
committee
be
form
have
pass
sufficiently
to
do
away
with
this
committee
and
place
control
of
inventory
where
it
belongs
with
other
operating
problem
under
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
operation
the
function
of
the
inventory
committee
have
be
to
pas
upon
production
schedule
accord
to
which
delivery
of
material
as
require
might
be
arrange
for
by
the
operating
unit
and
in
specific
case
to
authorize
or
disapprove
the
take
in
of
material
beyond
the
need
of
current
operation
the
operating
unit
themselves
must
of
necessity
be
look
to
as
the
primary
seat
of
control
of
inventory
the
interposition
of
an
inventory
committee
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
finance
committee
with
its
delegate
power
in
the
direction
of
inventory
control
affords
a
condition
of
dual
responsibility
which
in
normal
condition
be
unwholesome
and
objectionable
in
other
word
it
be
time
to
abandon
emergency
measure
in
this
area
and
to
develop
broad
policy
and
practice
the
important
thing
be
to
determine
an
inventory
policy
that
could
be
expect
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
the
crisis
to
this
end
mr
brown
propose
to
establish
a
new
relationship
between
financial
policy
and
the
operating
organization
he
write
insofar
as
the
whole
inventory
and
commitment
involves
the
matter
of
work
capital
requirement
the
finance
committee
must
have
its
voice
reflect
in
the
control
but
this
have
well
be
by
way
of
rule
cover
point
of
general
policy
rather
than
by
any
attempt
at
direct
action
moreover
it
would
seem
logical
and
sound
in
organization
principle
for
the
vice
president
or
chief
executive
in
charge
of
operation
to
be
look
to
to
see
that
the
division
effectually
control
inventory
to
accord
with
finance
committee
policy
or
good
business
practice
the
financial
department
of
the
company
be
intimately
concerned
in
the
matter
and
should
be
expect
to
follow
the
situation
closely
at
all
time
so
that
through
the
regular
financial
forecast
or
by
other
report
the
finance
committee
shall
be
as
fully
inform
as
possible
of
the
company
s
position
and
prospective
capital
requirement
these
observation
outline
the
first
tangible
step
for
a
new
financial
control
system
in
general
motor
they
be
approve
by
the
finance
committee
in
may
and
so
become
the
policy
of
the
corporation
the
inventory
committee
be
disband
and
the
administration
of
inventory
be
return
to
the
division
the
instrumentality
of
control
then
become
the
divisional
four
month
forecast
of
expect
business
which
come
to
me
as
vice
president
in
charge
of
operation
that
be
it
come
to
me
after
mid
this
forecast
be
the
key
to
inventory
control
and
it
be
my
responsibility
to
review
and
approve
it
thus
the
division
manager
still
bought
the
material
but
they
be
permit
to
buy
only
enough
at
a
time
to
make
the
number
of
car
and
truck
specify
in
their
approve
production
schedule
production
control
it
should
be
understood
however
that
conceptually
and
in
practice
these
measure
grow
out
of
the
crisis
concerned
mainly
the
control
of
unfinished
good
and
commitment
for
them
there
remain
to
be
solve
the
more
formidable
problem
of
control
the
inventory
of
finish
product
this
involve
not
only
the
problem
of
sell
the
car
on
hand
but
of
control
the
level
of
car
production
to
assist
in
this
aim
we
enlarge
the
scope
of
the
four
month
forecast
mention
above
to
include
plant
investment
work
capital
and
outstanding
inventory
commitment
as
well
as
estimate
sale
production
and
earnings
these
enlarge
forecast
originate
in
the
division
and
be
to
be
in
my
hand
on
the
twenty
fifth
of
each
month
they
cover
the
current
month
and
each
of
the
three
ensue
month
after
consult
with
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
finance
i
approve
or
modify
the
production
schedule
for
each
division
in
the
light
of
these
forecast
for
some
year
this
arrangement
brought
mr
brown
and
myself
into
a
continuous
relationship
both
before
and
after
i
become
president
my
approval
of
the
production
schedule
constitute
authority
for
the
division
manager
to
proceed
with
production
and
to
purchase
or
contract
for
delivery
of
material
this
procedure
introduce
the
first
serious
effort
at
forecasting
in
general
motor
the
only
forecast
of
any
sort
before
the
emergency
of
have
be
prepared
by
the
treasurer
for
the
finance
committee
his
forecast
which
cover
sale
earnings
work
capital
and
cash
position
for
the
corporation
as
a
whole
be
useful
in
general
financial
planning
however
they
do
not
represent
the
division
own
estimate
of
expect
operating
result
indeed
they
do
not
even
include
divisional
breakdown
the
division
manager
therefore
could
hardly
be
held
accountable
for
fulfil
forecast
make
by
an
authority
remote
from
them
and
so
the
forecast
be
of
little
value
in
appraise
and
control
divisional
operating
plan
and
since
the
treasurer
s
forecast
of
sale
be
nothing
more
than
an
assumption
make
at
a
distance
from
the
customer
their
accuracy
be
not
great
the
new
administration
in
likewise
have
very
little
data
on
which
to
base
a
production
schedule
but
we
have
to
proceed
anyway
in
the
nature
of
the
business
we
have
to
build
up
stock
for
spring
demand
then
in
june
and
july
three
or
four
month
before
the
end
of
the
model
year
we
have
to
estimate
sale
for
the
balance
of
the
model
year
to
be
out
of
stock
of
car
of
the
current
model
or
nearly
so
when
the
new
model
come
in
this
estimate
could
not
be
change
since
upon
it
we
have
to
base
calculation
to
get
the
right
amount
of
material
our
estimate
procedure
have
evolve
over
the
year
but
in
principle
we
still
do
the
same
thing
the
key
element
in
the
forecast
of
course
be
expect
sale
from
which
the
number
of
car
and
truck
to
be
produce
be
determine
the
level
of
production
require
to
yield
a
give
number
of
car
ready
to
sell
on
a
give
date
and
the
quantity
of
material
require
to
support
that
production
could
be
determine
accurately
by
a
purely
technical
calculation
relatively
easy
to
make
the
real
problem
be
to
forecast
how
many
car
we
could
expect
to
sell
it
be
in
an
effort
to
make
the
sale
forecast
as
accurate
as
possible
that
we
put
the
responsibility
for
them
directly
on
the
division
manager
since
they
be
closer
to
the
consumer
and
therefore
the
most
likely
to
be
well
inform
on
sale
trend
begin
in
i
ask
the
division
manager
to
give
me
report
of
their
actual
unit
production
and
sale
at
the
factory
for
ten
day
period
end
on
the
tenth
twentieth
and
final
day
of
each
month
and
i
ask
them
to
report
at
the
end
of
each
month
how
many
unfilled
order
for
car
they
have
how
many
finish
car
they
have
in
their
plant
and
how
many
car
they
estimate
their
dealer
have
on
hand
at
that
time
such
report
although
they
be
raw
estimate
of
dealer
stock
be
a
novelty
and
for
a
few
year
they
provide
the
only
factual
basis
for
determine
car
production
requirement
in
general
motor
the
big
gap
in
our
information
system
at
headquarters
and
in
the
division
be
at
the
retail
level
we
knew
how
many
car
and
truck
our
division
be
sell
to
our
dealer
but
we
do
not
know
the
current
rate
at
which
those
vehicle
be
be
resold
to
the
public
we
be
not
in
touch
with
the
actual
retail
market
the
division
manager
give
me
monthly
report
on
the
number
of
car
in
the
hand
of
their
dealer
but
most
of
them
estimate
dealer
inventory
without
ask
the
dealer
themselves
to
supply
current
data
this
method
or
lack
of
it
limited
our
sensitivity
to
change
market
trend
and
require
the
staff
at
headquarters
to
base
its
sale
forecast
on
figure
that
be
not
only
weak
but
also
several
week
old
such
a
time
lag
could
be
dangerous
it
become
in
fact
the
source
of
a
new
crisis
begin
in
i
ask
the
division
manager
to
submit
at
the
end
of
each
year
estimate
of
their
expect
operating
result
for
the
year
to
come
along
with
the
regular
four
month
forecast
these
annual
estimate
be
really
three
different
forecast
in
one
for
i
request
them
to
predict
for
the
come
year
what
their
sale
earnings
and
capital
requirement
would
be
on
the
basis
of
expectation
that
be
pessimistic
conservative
that
be
most
likely
and
optimistic
these
compilation
be
not
regard
as
commitment
fortunately
for
they
do
not
prove
to
be
very
accurate
the
shorter
term
forecast
have
a
good
accuracy
record
and
the
long
term
forecast
be
fairly
good
for
and
but
prove
to
be
much
too
high
for
even
the
pessimistic
forecast
for
that
year
be
too
high
there
be
cause
the
year
have
be
so
good
that
some
of
our
car
division
particularly
chevrolet
have
lose
potential
sale
because
they
be
unable
to
supply
the
ultimate
consumer
with
car
when
require
most
of
the
division
manager
project
this
experience
onto
the
prospect
for
and
resolve
not
to
miss
any
more
sale
because
of
underproduction
they
set
high
production
rate
for
the
early
part
of
some
of
the
division
manager
toward
the
end
of
ask
permission
to
exceed
their
approve
production
requirement
during
the
winter
for
the
expect
spring
demand
i
recommend
that
the
finance
committee
approve
this
request
and
the
committee
do
so
although
i
thus
share
the
belief
that
an
increase
in
sale
be
to
be
expect
i
also
held
the
view
that
some
of
the
division
be
planning
to
build
more
car
than
a
moderate
improvement
in
sale
would
justify
i
ask
several
of
the
division
manager
to
reconsider
their
production
schedule
in
each
case
their
reply
be
that
in
their
opinion
the
schedule
be
justified
sign
of
distress
begin
to
appear
early
in
in
a
report
to
the
finance
and
executive
committee
date
march
i
point
out
that
the
corporation
and
the
industry
as
a
whole
have
what
be
probably
a
large
number
of
unsold
car
in
the
hand
of
dealer
distributor
and
branch
than
at
any
previous
time
comparison
of
unit
sale
and
production
figure
for
the
four
month
period
october
to
january
with
the
correspond
figure
for
the
year
before
show
that
our
production
have
increase
about
percent
while
our
sale
to
the
ultimate
consumer
have
decline
about
percent
here
the
time
lag
enter
i
do
not
get
these
figure
until
the
first
week
in
march
i
warn
the
manager
of
the
division
of
the
grow
danger
and
at
chevrolet
and
oakland
i
insist
upon
immediate
and
drastic
curtailment
of
production
schedule
the
division
manager
comply
reluctantly
as
late
as
the
end
of
march
a
couple
of
them
still
held
that
their
disappoint
sale
figure
be
entirely
the
result
of
bad
weather
and
that
as
soon
as
the
weather
improve
brisk
sell
would
justify
their
original
production
rate
at
that
time
i
be
concerned
not
with
current
stock
but
with
the
possibility
that
a
dangerous
surplus
might
develop
by
july
mr
brown
s
figure
indicate
that
all
be
not
well
and
although
i
be
impressed
by
them
i
hesitate
to
overrule
the
divisional
people
who
have
the
responsibility
for
sell
there
will
always
be
some
conflict
between
the
figure
men
and
the
salesman
since
the
salesman
naturally
think
they
can
do
something
about
a
statistical
situation
as
they
often
can
i
get
in
the
middle
here
between
mr
brown
and
the
division
as
i
often
do
in
the
presence
of
conflict
representation
of
reality
but
then
in
may
mr
brown
and
i
make
a
trip
into
the
field
to
discus
distribution
problem
with
the
dealer
in
their
place
of
business
and
on
that
trip
i
come
to
know
beyond
doubt
that
the
march
cutback
have
be
inadequate
and
that
overproduction
be
not
just
a
possibility
for
july
but
already
a
certainty
it
be
not
often
that
the
chief
executive
of
a
large
corporation
himself
discovers
visible
overproduction
by
a
physical
check
of
the
inventory
but
automobile
be
big
unit
easy
to
count
in
st
louis
my
first
stop
in
kansa
city
and
again
in
los
angeles
i
stood
in
the
dealer
lot
and
saw
the
inventory
park
in
row
the
figure
man
in
this
instance
be
right
and
the
salesman
be
wrong
everywhere
the
inventory
be
excessive
i
then
issue
one
of
the
few
flat
order
i
ever
give
to
the
division
manager
during
the
time
i
serve
as
chief
executive
officer
of
general
motor
this
order
direct
all
division
manager
to
curtail
production
schedule
immediately
the
overall
total
reduction
for
the
corporation
amount
to
about
unit
a
month
by
cut
production
schedule
drastically
we
be
able
to
reduce
dealer
stock
to
manageable
proportion
in
a
few
month
time
but
not
without
considerable
economic
hardship
to
the
employee
of
the
corporation
who
be
laid
off
on
june
i
be
take
to
task
by
the
finance
committee
for
not
have
anticipate
and
prevent
this
overproduction
the
committee
adopt
a
resolution
request
me
to
explain
how
our
production
schedule
be
developed
and
who
be
responsible
for
the
excessive
number
of
general
motor
car
in
dealer
hand
during
the
spring
and
summer
and
what
we
propose
to
do
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
such
an
event
the
committee
state
its
question
as
follow
first
what
plan
of
procedure
have
heretofore
be
follow
in
develop
production
schedule
second
what
be
the
justification
of
a
production
schedule
of
car
for
april
as
indicate
by
the
february
th
forecast
recognize
that
the
stock
of
car
in
the
field
be
approximately
as
of
the
end
of
february
third
why
be
step
not
take
earlier
by
the
operating
division
to
drastically
curtail
their
production
more
in
line
with
the
unsold
stock
of
car
in
the
field
and
the
consumer
demand
fourth
what
step
will
be
take
to
assure
effective
control
of
production
schedule
in
the
future
to
guard
against
over
production
fifth
in
what
way
will
the
finance
committee
be
inform
as
to
the
general
aspect
of
the
situation
enable
it
to
determine
whether
monthly
forecast
be
predicate
upon
a
volume
of
sale
to
consumer
which
be
in
harmony
with
the
committee
s
judgement
of
general
business
condition
in
my
reply
to
the
committee
on
september
i
censure
some
of
the
division
particularly
chevrolet
and
oakland
i
point
out
that
cadillac
be
the
only
division
that
have
be
guide
in
any
way
in
its
production
planning
by
sale
to
ultimate
consumer
the
other
division
have
developed
their
production
schedule
in
various
way
generally
follow
the
notion
that
the
responsibility
from
the
sale
standpoint
cease
with
the
delivery
of
the
product
to
the
dealer
or
distributor
and
that
the
corporation
have
no
far
interest
in
the
situation
our
response
to
the
event
of
form
a
turn
point
in
the
development
of
our
procedure
for
control
of
our
production
schedule
i
described
the
situation
at
that
time
in
a
report
to
the
finance
committee
first
that
up
to
the
first
of
july
or
thereabouts
production
schedule
be
developed
in
various
way
base
largely
on
the
theory
that
the
responsibility
from
the
sale
standpoint
cease
with
the
delivery
of
the
product
to
the
dealer
or
distributor
and
that
the
corporation
have
no
far
concern
in
the
transaction
and
as
long
as
dealer
and
distributor
could
be
force
to
take
car
the
situation
be
regard
as
entirely
healthy
and
constructive
second
that
no
real
study
of
the
fundamental
have
ever
be
make
by
this
be
meant
that
although
information
as
to
the
sale
of
car
to
consumer
man
i
festly
the
real
index
have
be
available
in
a
more
or
less
satisfactory
form
during
the
past
two
year
this
fundamental
data
have
never
be
developed
and
capitalize
as
a
guide
in
the
preparation
of
production
schedule
third
that
july
st
a
procedure
be
developed
which
it
be
believe
place
production
schedule
on
an
entirely
scientific
basis
and
found
on
a
real
fundamental
index
accountability
for
the
development
of
such
schedule
be
now
definitely
establish
between
the
operating
division
and
the
corporation
itself
the
latter
satisfy
itself
as
to
the
constructiveness
of
same
a
copy
of
this
procedure
entitle
monthly
forecast
of
delivery
to
consumer
production
inventory
and
sale
have
already
be
submit
to
your
committee
but
to
make
this
report
complete
that
section
of
it
deal
with
an
analysis
of
production
requirement
base
on
forecast
of
delivery
to
consumer
be
append
as
exhibit
a
fourth
the
lack
of
a
proper
and
fundamental
development
of
production
schedule
be
in
no
sense
limited
to
general
motor
division
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
same
method
be
be
follow
by
the
entire
industry
this
situation
be
one
of
the
cause
contribute
to
the
present
economic
condition
of
the
average
automotive
dealer
which
condition
be
report
to
your
committee
by
the
undersigned
follow
the
field
trip
take
during
the
month
of
may
fifth
after
due
consideration
the
undersigned
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
issue
a
statement
which
as
evidence
by
comment
receive
from
dealer
and
distributor
and
by
editorial
in
the
automotive
press
have
be
recognize
as
perform
a
valuable
service
and
establish
a
precedent
which
other
automotive
manufacturer
will
be
inclined
to
follow
in
future
in
my
statement
to
the
finance
committee
then
i
sum
up
my
personal
feeling
a
that
it
be
rather
a
reflection
on
the
general
motor
corporation
and
equally
so
on
the
industry
as
a
whole
that
nothing
of
this
kind
have
be
accomplish
before
nevertheless
like
many
other
important
consideration
which
have
not
yet
be
developed
as
logically
as
they
might
be
this
should
be
look
upon
as
a
natural
happen
in
an
industry
which
be
not
yet
thoroughly
stabilize
b
there
be
no
question
in
my
mind
but
that
general
motor
now
have
absolute
control
of
its
production
schedule
i
feel
far
that
the
policy
inaugurate
by
general
motor
as
evidence
by
the
corporation
s
dealer
policy
and
by
similar
statement
on
the
part
of
other
manufacturer
cannot
help
but
assist
the
economic
position
of
dealer
and
thus
be
a
great
help
to
the
industry
of
which
general
motor
be
such
an
important
part
i
have
recount
this
episode
of
because
of
its
consequence
for
it
marked
the
begin
of
reasonably
effective
production
control
in
general
motor
in
a
certain
very
important
sense
this
involve
the
reconciliation
of
the
work
of
two
kind
of
person
in
general
motor
essential
i
should
think
in
any
corporation
with
a
nationally
distribute
consumer
product
one
kind
be
the
sale
manager
with
his
natural
enthusiasm
optimism
and
belief
that
he
can
by
his
effort
influence
total
sale
the
other
be
the
statistical
person
who
make
his
analysis
objectively
on
broad
general
evidence
of
demand
resolve
the
conflict
between
these
two
viewpoint
would
give
one
an
idea
for
example
of
how
many
car
one
should
expect
dealer
to
stock
this
conflict
be
especially
acute
in
those
day
when
we
have
not
yet
solve
the
problem
of
reconcile
production
level
with
seasonal
peak
in
sale
and
of
course
behind
this
be
the
basic
problem
of
control
production
two
thing
be
involve
first
the
art
of
forecasting
and
second
shorten
the
reaction
time
when
a
forecast
prove
wrong
which
can
be
expect
to
happen
even
in
the
present
day
of
complex
mathematical
forecasting
technique
since
we
at
headquarters
have
begin
to
develop
technique
of
fact
find
and
analysis
we
be
in
a
well
position
than
the
division
to
forecast
total
industry
demand
and
total
sale
of
our
product
for
the
entire
model
year
and
since
production
the
level
of
dealer
inventory
and
general
financial
planning
all
depend
to
a
large
extent
on
the
outlook
for
the
entire
model
run
we
decide
in
to
establish
an
official
corporation
wide
estimate
of
consumer
demand
that
be
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
car
in
each
price
group
likely
to
be
sell
to
the
public
during
the
come
year
by
the
entire
automotive
industry
and
to
have
this
correlate
with
the
division
manager
forecast
keep
in
mind
the
percentage
of
each
price
group
that
general
motor
might
reasonably
be
expect
to
obtain
this
corporation
wide
estimate
be
base
upon
actual
experience
of
sale
during
the
past
three
sale
year
and
an
appraisal
of
the
general
business
outlook
for
the
come
year
we
take
the
first
actual
step
in
put
limit
on
the
division
in
the
spring
of
mr
brown
and
i
work
out
along
the
above
line
an
estimate
volume
of
business
for
the
second
half
of
the
year
for
the
corporation
as
a
whole
and
for
each
division
we
call
this
expectation
of
sale
volume
the
index
volume
that
be
the
volume
to
be
regard
as
the
pointer
for
a
twelve
month
period
after
the
index
volume
have
be
approve
by
the
operation
committee
i
issue
a
general
letter
to
the
division
manager
on
may
ask
that
their
forecast
for
the
last
six
month
of
be
base
on
that
index
this
letter
read
in
part
heretofore
in
ask
for
these
estimate
the
divisional
sale
forecast
the
basis
upon
which
they
have
be
consider
i
e
the
volume
of
business
have
be
left
to
the
individual
judgment
of
each
operating
division
this
time
and
deal
with
the
second
half
of
the
year
i
believe
we
be
take
a
constructive
step
forward
i
mean
by
this
that
the
operation
committee
have
determine
as
a
group
the
probable
trend
of
business
for
the
manufacturing
year
begin
july
first
that
be
the
case
we
be
able
to
supply
specific
information
which
will
assist
our
division
in
more
accurately
forecasting
their
operating
result
we
have
in
general
motor
i
believe
for
the
first
time
and
deal
now
with
the
corporation
as
a
whole
a
definite
and
logically
express
viewpoint
as
to
what
the
probability
be
a
year
hence
of
course
the
trend
may
change
it
may
improve
and
i
personally
believe
it
will
it
may
decline
but
i
hardly
think
that
possible
if
either
take
place
an
adjustment
will
be
make
from
month
to
month
in
such
a
m
anner
as
to
eliminate
the
extreme
peak
and
decline
that
have
heretofore
be
characteristic
of
the
industry
and
of
general
motor
now
what
do
this
tale
of
internal
conflict
over
statistic
come
down
to
essentially
it
be
a
matter
of
statistical
control
versus
salesmanship
which
be
brought
to
a
head
in
by
a
recession
in
the
general
economy
follow
directly
upon
the
boom
year
of
at
that
time
the
salesman
and
the
general
manager
be
caught
in
the
illusion
of
rid
the
wave
in
our
then
excessively
decentralize
scheme
i
let
them
ride
actually
however
this
be
not
a
mere
bias
in
favor
of
the
salesman
for
i
have
no
convincing
information
with
which
to
counter
their
intuition
the
information
as
i
have
say
be
weak
and
late
the
information
be
weak
because
it
be
neither
accurate
nor
comprehensive
enough
it
be
arrive
at
by
inference
from
dealer
stock
and
unfilled
order
this
be
good
enough
over
a
period
of
time
but
the
critical
trouble
be
precisely
the
length
of
the
period
we
knew
nothing
about
the
most
recent
five
or
six
week
of
our
car
sale
and
this
gap
therefore
be
fill
with
the
speculation
of
the
protagonist
the
statistician
with
their
trend
line
on
the
one
hand
and
the
salesman
with
their
optimistic
intuition
on
the
other
i
be
as
i
have
say
in
the
middle
without
any
mean
to
judge
the
contend
claim
not
a
comfortable
position
for
a
chief
executive
officer
hence
the
need
first
to
limit
the
division
with
a
forecast
of
sale
for
the
model
year
but
since
this
expectation
could
easily
be
upset
by
actual
development
in
the
market
there
be
far
need
for
a
corrective
device
which
would
enable
us
to
retreat
from
or
advance
beyond
the
expectation
and
thereby
also
readjust
the
expectation
and
remember
this
that
in
the
automobile
industry
you
cannot
operate
without
program
and
planning
it
be
a
matter
of
respect
figure
on
the
future
as
a
guide
the
essential
element
be
the
forecast
and
the
correction
each
equally
critical
for
upon
the
forecast
for
the
model
year
make
several
month
before
that
year
begin
depend
the
plan
and
outlay
for
tool
and
other
preparation
for
the
level
of
actual
production
after
the
model
year
begin
this
forecast
the
index
volume
although
often
revise
be
the
guide
mark
for
six
to
eight
month
after
which
the
model
year
be
close
out
by
a
final
unalterable
decision
on
production
the
tool
of
course
be
unalterably
settle
ahead
of
time
but
after
the
model
year
begin
we
depend
upon
the
accuracy
of
current
information
and
the
swiftness
with
which
we
receive
it
as
the
control
mechanism
with
which
to
make
other
essential
correction
these
be
the
lesson
of
and
they
lead
to
the
follow
action
we
work
out
in
and
a
system
of
statistical
report
to
be
sent
by
the
dealer
to
the
division
every
ten
day
the
core
of
these
report
be
the
information
on
dealer
sale
of
car
and
truck
to
consumer
during
ten
day
period
together
with
delivery
of
use
car
to
consumer
and
the
number
of
both
new
and
use
car
on
hand
in
dealer
lot
use
car
inventory
be
important
because
if
they
back
up
in
the
hand
of
dealer
they
would
block
the
sale
of
new
car
with
this
information
in
hand
each
ten
day
the
division
thereafter
have
an
up
to
date
comprehensive
picture
of
the
situation
in
the
field
the
division
and
the
headquarters
staff
be
then
able
to
take
corrective
action
and
make
new
forecast
with
great
accuracy
as
a
far
aid
to
sale
forecasting
we
use
independent
data
on
retail
sale
to
supplement
the
ten
day
report
from
dealer
since
the
end
of
we
have
obtain
from
the
r
l
polk
company
regular
report
on
new
car
registration
these
report
be
also
available
to
others
in
the
industry
the
whole
procedure
thus
put
production
and
schedule
on
a
more
discipline
basis
and
clearly
define
the
accountability
of
the
operating
division
and
of
the
corporation
management
for
the
development
of
production
schedule
we
have
endeavor
always
to
refine
and
improve
our
technique
in
the
area
of
estimate
retail
demand
and
the
distribution
and
financial
staff
have
achieve
some
success
in
the
field
of
market
analysis
in
the
sale
section
undertook
a
comprehensive
study
of
the
total
automobile
market
base
on
the
then
prevail
concept
that
there
be
a
pyramid
of
demand
formulate
by
mr
bradley
in
the
study
attempt
to
provide
information
on
the
size
of
the
total
market
for
the
next
few
year
the
market
potential
in
the
various
price
class
the
probable
effect
of
price
reduction
on
the
size
of
the
market
the
competitive
relationship
of
new
and
use
car
and
when
the
so
call
saturation
point
would
be
reach
in
the
market
the
finding
of
this
study
underestimated
the
future
growth
in
the
market
but
its
comprehensive
approach
to
the
problem
represent
a
significant
advance
in
market
analysis
technique
in
the
automobile
industry
the
analysis
of
market
potential
by
price
class
in
particular
be
an
important
concept
that
have
not
previously
be
developed
to
a
satisfactory
degree
also
the
study
clearly
demonstrate
the
relationship
between
potential
automobile
demand
and
the
distribution
of
income
in
the
united
state
with
this
knowledge
we
be
able
to
give
more
meaningful
recognition
to
the
pyramid
of
demand
in
planning
our
sale
strategy
and
productive
capacity
the
study
fail
to
gauge
accurately
the
future
growth
of
the
market
largely
because
it
underestimated
the
effect
of
two
important
factor
on
new
car
sale
one
of
these
be
the
process
of
continuous
product
improvement
which
stimulate
consumer
demand
by
provide
increase
value
for
the
customer
s
dollar
the
other
be
the
continued
growth
of
the
economy
and
the
effect
of
general
economic
condition
on
the
sale
of
the
industry
in
any
specific
year
in
this
latter
connection
mr
bradley
later
introduce
into
the
consideration
of
market
potential
the
concept
that
there
be
a
definite
relationship
between
car
sale
and
overall
economic
activity
he
and
his
staff
continued
their
interest
in
the
question
of
the
ups
and
down
of
the
automobile
business
in
relation
to
the
business
cycle
and
saw
that
when
business
and
hence
national
income
be
on
an
ascend
trend
car
sale
increase
at
an
even
faster
rate
than
income
and
when
business
be
on
a
decline
trend
sale
decrease
at
a
faster
rate
than
income
as
additional
statistical
material
on
the
overall
economy
become
available
we
be
able
to
refine
our
technique
and
demonstrate
the
remarkably
close
correlation
between
car
sale
and
personal
income
a
correlation
that
still
exists
today
for
car
sale
and
disposable
income
after
tax
to
return
then
to
the
problem
of
production
control
once
the
total
year
s
production
of
a
division
have
be
forecast
the
division
manager
s
problem
be
to
spread
that
production
out
over
the
year
to
maintain
his
output
at
as
even
a
rate
as
possible
while
still
allow
for
seasonal
fluctuation
in
sale
this
be
not
easy
the
automobile
business
be
still
seasonal
to
some
extent
and
it
be
very
much
so
in
the
early
s
before
we
have
improve
road
the
close
car
and
such
device
as
financial
incentive
to
dealer
to
increase
their
trade
in
allowance
during
slack
period
from
the
standpoint
of
the
dealer
s
convenience
and
the
most
economical
control
of
finish
good
inventory
the
factory
should
have
varied
its
output
to
conform
to
seasonal
demand
such
a
practice
would
have
reduce
the
risk
of
obsolescence
and
the
cost
of
store
finish
product
for
both
dealer
and
manufacturer
on
the
other
hand
absolutely
level
production
or
the
near
to
it
that
could
be
attain
be
ideal
from
the
standpoint
of
efficient
utilization
of
plant
and
labor
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
employee
s
welfare
since
consideration
of
economical
distribution
and
economical
manufacture
be
thus
diametrically
oppose
planning
and
judgment
be
require
to
find
a
reasonable
balance
between
them
the
headquarters
staff
assist
the
division
manager
in
this
task
with
a
seasonal
analysis
of
the
year
s
sale
estimate
and
a
computation
for
each
division
of
an
absolute
minimum
work
stock
to
be
maintain
and
the
maximum
seasonal
excess
over
that
minimum
that
be
allowable
at
the
end
of
each
four
month
forecast
period
and
every
ten
day
when
the
report
from
the
dealer
come
in
each
division
manager
compare
his
actual
result
with
the
forecast
for
the
month
and
review
his
production
and
purchasing
schedule
this
be
the
heart
of
the
matter
if
sale
be
run
behind
the
forecast
production
be
reduce
if
sale
be
boom
he
could
within
the
limit
of
his
plant
capacity
increase
his
output
each
month
he
adjust
his
forecast
for
the
next
four
month
to
conform
to
the
current
sale
trend
thus
instead
of
lay
down
a
hard
and
fast
production
schedule
four
month
ahead
and
stick
to
it
whatever
the
actual
trend
of
retail
demand
we
be
able
to
change
production
schedule
when
sale
indicate
to
the
management
that
such
a
change
be
necessary
we
be
able
to
keep
production
in
line
with
the
indicate
retail
demand
while
still
keep
the
accumulation
of
finish
product
in
the
hand
of
both
division
and
dealer
no
low
than
the
desire
minimum
thus
the
more
important
thing
in
the
end
be
not
the
correctness
of
the
index
for
the
model
year
but
the
sensitivity
to
actual
market
change
through
prompt
report
and
adjustment
the
objectivity
and
systematic
use
of
the
information
have
a
coordinate
influence
upon
the
headquarters
staff
and
the
division
of
the
corporation
it
reduce
the
possibility
of
irrational
conflict
such
as
that
of
it
also
operate
as
a
basic
control
on
expense
employment
investment
and
the
like
the
effect
of
the
new
forecasting
and
schedule
be
apparent
in
operating
result
material
inventory
be
kept
to
a
minimum
in

of

over
about

by
the

increase
to
four

and
by
to
nearly
seven
and
one
half

an
even
great
improvement

in
the

in
stabilize

but
the
problem
of
keep
production
at
a
stable
level
be
still
unsolved
today
and
very
likely
will
remain
so
owe
in
part
to
the
incompletely
solve
problem
of
forecasting
sale
in
the
uncertain
future
other
problem
the
variation
in
the
level
of
demand
both
cyclical
and
seasonal
and
the
influence
of
the
model
change
and
the
buying
habit
of
the
general
public
have
also
have
much
to
do
with
keep
production
from
remain
stable
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
could
achieve
perfect
forecasting
and
still
find
ourselves
unable
to
stabilize
production
much
more
than
we
can
today
the
closer
alignment
of
current
production
schedule
with
the
movement
of
the
final
product
into
the
hand
of
consumer
also
improve
the
turnover
of
dealer
inventory
and
hence
their
profit
position
in
the
turnover
of
new
car
inventory
in
the
hand
of
general
motor
dealer
throughout
the
united
state
be
twelve
time
approximately
percent
great
than
in
any
previous
year
our
production
control
system
be
essentially
complete
in
since
then
progress
in
this
area
have
be
a
matter
of
refinement
the
key
to
coordinate
control
of
decentralize
operation
have
thus
establish
technique
of
control
in
the
particular
area
of
appropriation
cash
inventory
and
production
the
general
question
remain
how
could
we
exercise
permanent
control
over
the
whole
corporation
in
a
way
consistent
with
the
decentralize
scheme
of
organization
we
never
cease
to
attack
this
paradox
indeed
we
could
not
avoid
a
solution
of
it
without
yield
both
the
actual
decentralize
structure
of
our
business
and
our
philosophy
of
approach
to
it
i
have
dealt
in
earlier
chapter
with
the
organization
aspect
of
the
question
as
it
be
developed
in
theory
and
practice
in
general
motor
in
the
early
s
but
that
alone
be
not
enough
it
be
on
the
financial
side
that
the
last
necessary
key
to
decentralization
with
coordinate
control
be
found
that
key
in
principle
be
the
concept
that
if
we
have
the
mean
to
review
and
judge
the
effectiveness
of
operation
we
could
safely
leave
the
prosecution
of
those
operation
to
the
men
in
charge
of
them
the
mean
as
it
turn
out
be
a
method
of
financial
control
which
convert
the
broad
principle
of
return
on
investment
into
one
of
the
important
work
instrument
for
measure
the
operation
of
the
division
the
basic
element
of
financial
control
in
general
motor
be
cost
price
volume
and
rate
of
return
on
investment
a
word
on
rate
of
return
as
a
strategic
principle
of
business
i
be
not
go
to
say
that
rate
of
return
be
a
magic
wand
for
every
occasion
in
business
there
be
time
when
you
have
to
spend
money
just
to
stay
in
business
regardless
of
the
visible
rate
of
return
competition
be
the
final
price
determinant
and
competitive
price
may
result
in
profit
which
force
you
to
accept
a
rate
of
return
less
than
you
hop
for
or
for
that
matter
to
accept
temporary
loss
and
in
time
of
inflation
the
rate
of
return
concept
come
up
against
the
problem
of
asset
undervalue
in
term
of
replacement
nevertheless
no
other
financial
principle
with
which
i
be
acquaint
serf
well
than
rate
of
return
as
an
objective
aid
to
business
judgment
this
principle
have
govern
the
think
of
the
finance
committee
of
general
motor
since
as
it
have
govern
the
think
of
the
du
pont
people
and
certain
other
businessmen
in
the
united
state
before
that
time
i
do
not
know
the
origin
of
the
principle
itself
even
the
least
sophisticated
investor
measure
his
profit
from
stock
bond
or
saving
account
in
term
of
what
he
put
into
them
so
too
i
imagine
every
businessman
evaluates
profit
in
term
of
his
total
investment
it
be
a
rule
of
the
game
so
to
speak
there
be
other
measure
for
the
run
of
a
business
for
example
profit
on
sale
and
penetration
of
the
market
but
they
do
not
supersede
return
on
investment
however
the
question
be
not
simply
one
of
maximize
the
rate
of
return
for
a
specific
short
period
of
time
mr
brown
s
thought
on
this
be
that
the
fundamental
consideration
be
an
average
return
over
a
long
period
of
time
under
his
concept
general
motor
economic
objective
be
to
produce
not
necessarily
the
high
attainable
rate
of
return
on
the
capital
employ
but
the
high
return
consistent
with
attainable
volume
in
the
market
the
long
term
rate
of
return
be
to
be
the
high
expectation
consistent
with
a
sound
growth
of
the
business
or
what
we
call
the
economic
return
attainable
mr
brown
put
it
this
way
a
monopolistic
industry
or
an
individual
business
under
peculiar
circumstance
might
maintain
high
price
and
enjoy
a
limited
volume
with
very
high
rate
of
return
on
capital
indefinitely
at
the
sacrifice
of
wholesome
expansion
reduction
of
price
might
broaden
the
scope
of
demand
and
afford
an
enlargement
of
volume
highly
beneficial
even
though
the
rate
of
return
on
capital
might
be
low
the
limit
consideration
be
the
economic
cost
of
capital
the
ability
to
increase
supply
and
the
extent
to
which
demand
will
be
stimulate
by
price
reduction
thus
it
be
apparent
that
the
object
of
management
be
not
necessarily
the
high
attainable
rate
of
return
on
capital
but
rather
the
high
return
consistent
with
attainable
volume
care
be
exercise
to
assure
profit
with
each
increment
of
volume
that
will
at
least
equal
the
economic
cost
of
additional
capital
require
therefore
the
fundamental
consideration
be
the
economic
cost
of
capital
to
the
individual
business
pricing
policy
in
relation
to
financial
control
management
and
administration
february
when
donaldson
brown
come
to
general
motor
he
brought
with
him
a
financial
yardstick
it
be
a
method
of
crystallize
fact
bearing
on
the
efficiency
of
management
in
the
various
phase
of
the
business
such
as
inventory
control
plan
for
capital
investment
in
relation
to
expect
demand
on
production
cost
control
and
the
like
in
other
word
mr
brown
developed
the
concept
of
return
on
investment
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
be
use
to
measure
the
effectiveness
of
each
division
s
operation
as
well
as
to
evaluate
broad
investment
decision
his
concept
can
be
express
in
the
form
of
an
equation
for
compute
return
on
investment
and
it
be
still
one
of
the
measure
use
by
the
du
pont
company
and
general
motor
to
evaluate
divisional
performance
this
book
however
be
not
the
place
for
such
technicality
as
formal
equation
i
shall
touch
only
on
general
concept
of
financial
control
rate
of
return
of
course
be
affected
by
all
the
factor
in
the
business
hence
if
one
can
see
how
these
factor
individually
bear
upon
a
rate
of
return
one
have
a
penetrate
look
into
the
business
to
obtain
this
insight
mr
brown
define
return
on
investment
as
a
function
of
the
profit
margin
and
the
rate
of
turnover
of
invest
capital
multiply
one
by
the
other
equal
the
percent
of
return
on
investment
if
this
seem
obscure
pas
over
it
and
note
only
that
you
can
get
an
increase
in
return
on
investment
by
increase
the
rate
of
turnover
of
capital
in
relation
to
sale
as
well
as
by
increase
profit
margin
each
of
these
two
element
profit
margin
and
rate
of
turnover
of
capital
mr
brown
broke
into
its
detailed
component
a
case
you
might
say
of
aggregate
and
de
aggregate
figure
to
bring
about
a
recognition
of
the
structure
of
profit
and
loss
in
operation
essentially
it
be
a
matter
of
make
thing
visible
the
unique
thing
be
that
it
make
possible
the
creation
base
on
experience
of
detailed
standard
or
yardstick
for
work
capital
and
fix
capital
requirement
and
for
the
various
element
of
cost
to
get
standard
for
commercial
expense
and
manufacturing
expense
mr
brown
use
past
performance
modify
by
plan
for
the
future
the
yardstick
thus
establish
be
compare
with
actual
performance
the
heart
of
the
financial
control
principle
lie
in
such
comparison
mr
brown
be
able
to
set
up
table
show
for
example
how
the
size
of
the
inventory
and
work
capital
be
affect
the
turnover
of
capital
in
the
different
division
or
to
what
extent
sell

be
a
drag

to
make
this

work
each

the

if
the

about
the
corrective

take
when
as
chief
operating

i
carry

both

the

not

they
simply
expose
the

with
which
to

whether
the

operating
in

with

in

form
which
with
some
modification
be
still
use
in

be
the
first
step
in
educate
our
operating
personnel
in
the
meaning
and
importance
of

it
provide
executive
with
a
quantitative
basis
for
sound
decision
make
and
thereby
laid
the
foundation
for
what
be
to
be
one
of
general

most
important
characteristic
namely
its
effort
to
achieve
open
mind
communication
and
objective
consideration
of
fact
in
the
begin
many
limitation
in
our

be
evident
the

for

be
not

for

and

until
they
be
set
up
on
a
uniform
and
consistent
basis
uniformity
be
essential
to
financial
control
since
without
it
comparison
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
one
of
the
immediate
task
therefore
be
to
strengthen
the
accounting
organization
both
centrally
and
within
the
division
and
to
institute
standard
accounting
practice
throughout
the
organization
the
classification
of
account
throughout
the
corporation
be
standardize
on
january
a
standard
accounting
manual
specify
a
uniform
set
of
procedure
become
effective
throughout
the
corporation
on
january
to
coordinate
financial
organization
of
the
division
and
the
central
financial
staff
we
reaffirm
in
the
principle
of
dual
responsibility
for
the
divisional
comptroller
which
have
be
introduce
in
to
make
those
comptroller
responsible
not
only
to
their
divisional
general
manager
but
to
the
corporation
comptroller
as
well
the
development
of
a
uniform
accounting
practice
enable
us
to
analyze
the
internal
condition
of
each
division
and
to
compare
one
division
s
operating
performance
with
another
s
but
what
be
equally
important
the
uniform
accounting
practice
create
guideline
with
some
exception
for
overhead
cost
accounting
both
for
actual
cost
of
production
and
for
develop
yardstick
for
evaluate
operating
efficiency
the
concept
of
standard
volume
while
we
have
developed
and
apply
the
concept
of
return
on
investment
and
have
make
progress
in
standardize
our
procedure
before
we
have
no
well
define
govern
objective
against
which
to
measure
our
result
as
a
practical
matter
because
of
the
influence
of
change
volume
our
result
show
wide
fluctuation
from
year
to
year
which
make
an
evaluation
particularly
difficult
therefore
begin
in
we
adopt
a
concept
developed
by
mr
brown
which
related
a
definite
long
term
return
on
investment
objective
to
average
or
standard
volume
expectation
over
a
number
of
year
we
take
the
view
that
the
existence
of
such
a
desire
long
term
return
on
investment
goal
would
provide
a
useful
yardstick
for
evaluate
operating
efficiency
and
the
effect
of
competitive
pressure
on
pricing
with
this
approach
we
be
not
likely
to
lose
sight
of
the
long
run
earnings
objective
and
in
evaluate
our
price
we
would
always
be
aware
of
the
extent
to
which
competition
be
prevent
the
attainment
of
the
objective
the
concept
which
mr
brown
developed
of
course
be
only
a
theoretical
one
because
operating
result
be
determine
by
the
interplay
of
actual
price
competitively
determine
and
the
total
cost
incur
in
the
particular
year
regardless
of
volume
however
by
apply
a
yardstick
unaffected
by
short
term
volume
fluctuation
we
could
isolate
the
extent
to
which
we
be
deviate
from
our
long
term
profit
goal
and
make
a
thorough
evaluation
of
the
underlie
cause
the
concept
be
a
good
illustration
of
our
management
philosophy
of
define
a
soundly
conceive
theoretical
reference
to
guide
us
in
the
practical
management
of
our
affair
the
standard
volume
concept
be
a
method
for
view
the
long
range
performance
and
potential
of
our
business
and
its
division
base
on
average
volume
over
a
number
of
year
in
establish
this
policy
in
the
form
of
a
procedure
i
write
in
may
what
concern
our
stockholder
be
a
return
year
in
and
year
out
the
average
of
which
represent
a
fair
measure
of
the
possibility
of
the
business
in
which
we
be
engage
it
be
believe
the
establish
of
the
principle
outline
in
this
procedure
will
lead
to
this
result
it
must
be
agree
that
no
definite
rule
for
establish
price
can
ever
be
rigidly
adhere
to
that
be
in
no
sense
intend
it
be
believe
however
that
a
development
of
standard
price
reflect
proper
relation
to
cost

and
return
on

employ
will
be
most
useful
in

the

toward
determine
what
should

in
each

there

of

at

theoretical
but
found
on
experience
you
can
compute
a
desire
rate
of
return
if
in
fact
the
anticipate
return
do
not
result
it
may
be
because
competition
dictate
a
different

somewhere
the

a

at

that
s
not
typical
but
it
actually
happen
once
the
calculation
of
return
on

itself
tell
you
what
to
expect
if
the

be
high

low
than
the
adopt

the
chief
theoretical
contribution
of
mr
brown
and
mr
bradley
in
this
area
be
in
the
way
they
make
allowance
for
the
effect
on
unit
cost
of
variation
in
rate
of
production
over
the

as
long
as
material
cost
and
wage
rate
be
fairly
stable
direct

tend
to
remain
constant

this

the
semi

which
do
not
come
down
automatically
with

in
general

will
go

conversely
they
will

to

that
the

also
enable
us
to
establish
detailed

our

make
it
possible
to

in
a

of
the
indirect
manufacturing
expense
or
what
we
call
burden
burden
commonly
include
three
type
of

first
fix
burden
cost
such
as
rental
insurance
depreciation
and
amortization
which
in

remain
constant
regardless
of
the
level
of

second
semi
fix
cost
such
as
supervisor
salary
which
be
also
fix
within
a
reasonable
range
of
production
and
finally
variable
burden
cost
which
tend
to
vary
directly
with
the
level
of
production
such
as
labor
related
directly
to
manufacturing
cut
tool
pack
and
shipping
supply
lubricant
and
maintenance
all
of
these
expense
vary
from
department
to
department
and
allocate
them
properly
in
compute
the
cost
of
good
produce
be
a
difficult
part
of
any
cost
system
in
a
manufacturing
company
to
do
this
the
indirect
cost
be
related
to
direct
productive
labor
the
latter
can
be
determine
on
the
basis
of
time
study
and
know
wage
rate
the
fix
and
semi
fix
portion
of

can
be
translate
into

through
the
standard

the

this
classification
of

the
guide
principle
be
to
make
our
standard
difficult
to
achieve
but
possible
to
attain
which
i
believe
be
the
most
effective
way
of
capitalize
on
the
initiative
resourcefulness
and
capability
of
the
operating
personnel
it
be
obvious
that
with
stable
material
cost
and
wage
rate
if
our
bench
mark
show
that
unit
cost
be
high
in
relation
to

efficiency
have
be
reduce
because
of
competitive
resistance
to
price
increase
profit
could
be
maintain
only
by
reduction
in
unit
cost
if
there
be
a
general
rise
in
what
industry
paid
for
material
and
labor
competitive
force
might
allow
price
to
rise
this
be
likely
if
consumer
demand
for
car
be
strong
without
high
price
under
the
circumstance
the
automobile
industry
could
not
long
continue
to
supply
the
car
that
the
market
want
however
even
in
this
case
the
individual
manufacturer
be
under
pressure
to
reduce
his
unit
cost
since
competition
would
probably
not
allow
price
increase
sufficient
to
recover
the
full
cost
increase
an
alternative
approach
to
our
standard
volume
policy
would
have
be
to
evaluate
price
strictly
in
term
of
actual
unit
cost
at
actual
or
anticipate
production
level
because
our
fix
cost
be
so
large
this
would
have
meant
that
unit
cost
would
drop
in
time
of
high
volume
and
increase
during
period
of
low
production
any
attempt
to
raise
price
during
period
of
low
volume
even
if
competition
permit
to
recover
the
high
unit
cost
could
have
deflate
sale
still
far
with
the
result
of
still
low
profit
less
employment
and
a
generally
depressive
effect
on
the
economy
operating
as
we
do
in
a
highly
cyclical
industry
the
use
of
the
actual
unit
cost
type
of
evaluation
would
have
be
socially
and
economically
unsound
i
want
to
make
clear
however
that
in
any
give
year
our
income
which
have
to
reflect
all
actual
cost
be
importantly
affected
by
the
volume
attain
fix
cost
have
to
be
met
whether
business
be
good
or
bad
if
our
volume
fell
below
standard
only
a
portion
of
our
total
fix
cost
could
be
allocate
to
the
unit
cost
of
production
but
the
unallocated
remainder
would
have
to
be
deduct
in
arrive
at
report
income
conversely
if
volume
be
above
standard
total
income
would
be
increase
because
the
fix
cost
would
be
distribute
over
a
great
number
of
unit
produce
it
should
be
apparent
from
the
forego
that
profit
be
residual
base
upon
the
ability
of
the
manufacturer
to
keep
his
cost
below
the
sale
price
establish
in
a
competitive
market
that
be
profit
represent
the
difference
between
the
price
which
can
be
obtain
in
the
competitive
market
and
total
cost
and
it
be
substantially
affected
by
volume
we
can
estimate
very
closely
what
our
profit
per
unit
should
be
at
standard
volume
but
this
be
not
the
same
as
know
what
our
actual
profit
will
be
when
actual

be
realize

accomplish
some
thing
but
apart
from
survival
and
reorganization
they
be
more
in
the
realm
of
the
mind
than
of
reality
we
knew
as
i
have
related
the
strategy
with
which
we
propose
to
approach
the
car
business
how
we
propose
to
manage
the

financially
and
the

we
want
to
establish
among
person
in

but
by
the
end
of
little
of
this
be
reflect
in
our
activity
in
the
automobile
market
that
our
volume
of
business
have
increase
after
the
slump
of
and
especially
in
could
be
attribute
less
to
our
own

than
to
the
improvement
in
the

and
the
rise
demand
for
automobile
while
internally
we
have
make
much
progress
externally
we
have
marked
time
but
the
time
have
come
to
act
now
it
so
happen
luckily
for
us
that
during
the
first
part
of
the
s
and
especially
in
the
year
to
certain
change
take
place
in
the
nature
of
the

which
transform
it
into
something
different
from
what
it
have
be
all
the
year
up
to
that
time
seldom
perhaps
at
only
one
other
time
in
the

of
the

that
be
on
the
occasion
of
the
rise
of
the
model
t
after
have
the
industry
change
so
radically
as
it
do
through
the
middle
twenty
i
say
luckily
for
us
because
as
a
challenger
to
the
then
establish
position
of
ford
we
be
favor
by
change
we
have
no
stake
in
the
old
way
of
the
automobile
business
for
us
change
meant
opportunity
we
be
glad
to
bend
our
effort
to
go
with
it
and
make
the
most
of
it
we
be
prepared
too
with
the
various
business
concept
which
i
have
described
though
i
must
say
we
saw
them
as
merely
our
way
of
do
business
and
not
as
have
any
general
application
or
logical
involvement
in
the
future
of
the
industry
to
set
the
scene
let
me
divide
the
history
of
the
automobile
from
a
commercial
standpoint
into
three
period
there
be
the
period
before
which
with
its
expensive
car
be
entirely
that
of
a
class
market
then
the
period
from
to
the
mid
twenty
which
be
dominantly
that
of
a
mass
market
rule
by
ford
and
his
concept
of
basic
transportation
at
a
low
dollar
price
and
after
that
the
period
of
the
mass
market
serve
by
well
and
well
car
or
what
might
be
thought
of
as
the
mass
class
market
with
increase
diversity
this
last
i
think
i
may
correctly
identify
as
the
general
motor
concept
all
three
of
these
period
have
in
common
the
long
expand
american
economy
the
horizon
of
each
period
have
be
form
by
the
respective
degree
of
that
rise
and
its
spread
through
the
population
the
willingness
of
the
relatively
few
who
could
afford
them
to
buy
expensive
though
unreliable
car
by
today
s
standard
enable
the
industry
to
get
go
then
when
a
large
number
of
individual
be
able
to
afford
a
few
hundred
dollar
of
expenditure
they
make
possible
the
development
of
the
inexpensive
model
t
it
be
possible
that
such
a
market
be
long
wait
for
the
offering
of
a
car
like
the
model
t
as
the
economy
lead
by
the
automobile
industry
rise
to
a
new
high
level
in
the
twenty
a
complex
of
new
element
come
into
existence
to
transform
the
market
once
again
and
create
the
watershed
which
divide
the
present
from
the
past
these
new
element
i
think
i
can
without
significant
loss
reduce
to
four
installment
sell
the
use
car
trade
in
the
close
body
and
the
annual
model
i
would
add
improve
road
if
i
be
to
take
into
account
the
environment
of
the
automobile
so
imbed
be
these
element
in
the
nature
of
the
industry
today
that
to
conceive
of
the
market
without
them
be
almost
impossible
before
and
for
a
while
thereafter
the
typical
car
buyer
be
in
the
situation
of
buying
his
first
car
he
would
buy
it
for
cash
or
with
some
special
loan
arrangement
and
the
car
would
be
a
roadster
or
tour
car
most
likely
of
a
model
which
be
the
same
as
last
year
s
and
could
be
expect
to
be
the
same
as
next
year
s
this
situation
be
not
to
change
for
some
year
and
the
change
would
not
be
sudden
except
at
its
climax
for
each
of
the
new
element
of
change
have
a
separate
begin

the
statistic
of

in
those
day
be
very
poor
but
it
be
clear
that
it
grow
from
some
very
low
level
in
to
around
percent

we
believe
that
with

and
the
expectation
of
a
continuance
of
that
rise
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that

would
lift
their
sight
to
high
level
of
quality
installment

we
thought
would
stimulate
this
trend
as
the
first

come
back
for
the
second
round
and
brought
their

the

revolutionary
significance
not
only
for
dealer
arrangement
but
for
manufacturing
and
the
whole
character
of
production
since
dealer
usually
have
to
sell
to
a
man
who
already
have
a
car
with
mileage
left
in
it
the
statistic
for
use
car
trade
in
before
be
as
poor
as
those
for
installment
sell
it
stand
to
reason
however
that
there
be
some
kind
of
upward
curve
in
use
car
trade
from
world
war
i
on
if
only
because
there
be
relatively
few

before
that

until
some
unknown
date

the
total

of

in
operation
in
the
united

from
through
rise
by
year
in
million
approximately
as
follow
the

on
the
other
hand
produce
in
those
year
passenger
car
for
domestic
and
export
market
in
approximate
million
as
follow
this
production
be
enough
to
cover
both
the
growth
in

and
the

trade
perhaps
two
or
three
time
on
the
way
to
the

i

there
must
have
be
a

in

and
of
the
annual
model
i
shall
say
more
later
suffice
it
to
say
here
that
in
the
early
twenty
it
be
not
a
formal
concept
as
we
know
it
today
except
as
it
be
negatively
express
in
ford
s
concept
of
a
static
model
we
be
not
unconscious
of
the
unfold
of
these
four
element
when
the
administration
of
general
motor
change
in
we
start
gmac
in
the
installment
financing
field
in
we
have
an
interest
in
fisher
body
which
make
close
body
as
large
seller
of
medium
and
high
price
car
we
met
the
use
car
trade
in
early
and
we
try
to
make
our
model
more
attractive
each
year
yet
we
do
not
see
the
movement
especially
the
interaction
of
these
element
in
the
whole
automobile
market
as
i
can
see
it
today
look
back
we
saw
them
then
as
uncertainty
unknown
and
trend
in
the
form
of
figure
to
study
at
a
desk
however
the
plan
of
campaign
laid
down
in
the
product
program
of
logically
fit
well
and
well
the
unfold
situation
it
be
that
plan
policy
or
strategy
of
whatever
it
should
be
call
which
i
believe
more
than
any
other
single
factor
enable
us
to
move
into
the
rapidly
change
market
of
the
twenty
with
the
confidence
that
we
knew
what
we
be
do
commercially
and
be
not
merely
chase
around
in
search
of
a
lucky
star
the
most
important
particular
object
of
that
plan
of
campaign
which
follow
from
its
strategic
principle
be
as
i
have
say
to
develop
a
large
place
for
chevrolet
between
the
ford
car
below
and
the
medium
price
group
above
a
case
of
try
to
widen
a
niche
that
be
all
in
the
begin
despite
the
completeness
of
the
plan
with
regard
to
the
whole
market
there
be
the
pause
while
we
settle
the
copper
cool
engine
matter
in
which
we
give
up
the
commercial
mindedness
of
our
original
strategic
plan
to
pursue
an
engineering
dream
we
be
rescue
from
that
folly
by
the
four
million
car
and
truck
year
of
which
absorbed
some
chevrolets
and
we
saw
the
illusion
of
the
upward
swing
of
that
year
dash
in
the
recession
of
it
be
thus
make
clear
to
us
that
the
plan
of
would
have
meaning
only
if
meaning
be
give
to
it
in
the
design
of
the
product
itself
certain
fact
of
failure
in
particular
be
impressed
upon
us
during
the
year
while
the
industry
s
passenger
car
sale
in
the
united
state
fell
percent

fell

the

decline
in

of
about

unit
almost
half
be
represent
by
the
decline
in

car
sale
our
share
of
the
passenger

in
unit
drop
from
percent
to
percent
while
ford
s
share
go
up
from

to

some
of
the
general
motor
decline
be
in
buick
and
cadillac
as
be
to
be
expect
of
high
price
car
in
a
period
of
economic
recession
old
increase
oakland
be
unchanged
but
most
of
it
be
in
sale
of
the
chevrolet
which
fell
percent
while
sale
of
its
opposite
number
the
ford
fell
only
percent
of
course
what
happen
be
not
due
entirely
to
the
event
of
include
some
bad
management
but
to
the
recession
of
that
year
combine
with
earlier
event
the
lag
between
automotive
design
and
production
be
a
peculiar
feature
of
the
automobile
industry
the
event
in
a
current
year
be
always
in
part
due
to
decision
take
from
one
to
three
year
earlier
hence
the
extent
of
the
chevrolet
slump
of
could
properly
be
laid
to
the
retard
development
of
chevrolet
s
design
during
the
previous
three
year
among
other
thing
it
have
an
infamous
rear
end
but
there
be
no
use
specify
its
deficiency
the
curious
thing
be
that
there
we
be
with
a
plan
that
rest
upon
the
concept
of
well
and
well
car
with
a
big
package
of
accessory
and
improvement
beyond
basic
transportation
and
the
concept
of
a
chevrolet
at
a
high
price
that
would
be
so
compellingly
attractive
as
to
draw
buyer
away
from
the
model
t
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
wider
margin
between
aspiration
and
realization
than
that
represent
by
the
plan
of
and
the
chevrolet
of
nevertheless
we
do
not
alter
the
original
plan
perhaps
because
we
knew
well
than
anyone
the
cause
of
our
decline
indeed
from
the
time
the
copper
cool
engine
program
be
abandon
in
the
summer
of
chevrolet
s
engineer
head
by
mr
hunt
have
work
intensively
on
redesign
the
old
car
into
a
new
model
know
as
the
k
model
for
the
model
year
the
k
model
have
among
its
new
feature
a
longer
body
increase
leg
room
a
duco
finish
a
one
piece
windshield
with
automatic
wiper
on
all
close
car
a
dome
light
in
the
coach
and
sedan
a
klaxon
horn
an
improve
clutch
and
a
sound
rear
axle
housing
in
place
of
the
old
one
which
have
give
so
much
trouble
it
be
far
from
be
a
radically
new
car
but
it
be
much
well
than
it
have
be
and
in
the
particular
note
above
it
give
the
first
real
expression
of
what
we
have
in
mind
to
do
the
k
model
come
on
a
rise
market
in
and
recover
chevrolet
s
position
sharply
with
factory
sale
of
car
and
truck
a
percent
gain
over
and
a
level
percent
above
the
peak
ford
s
sale
held
about
even
in
with
a
volume
of
about
two
million
car
and
truck
but
since
the
market
as
a
whole
in
that
year
rise
substantially
over
ford
s
share
decline
relatively
from
to
percent
a
sign
of
danger
if
mr
ford
have
chosen
to
read
it
yet
he
still
held
almost
percent
of
the
low
price
field
and
his
tour
car
price
at
without
a
starter
or
demountable
rim
seem
unbeatable
in
that
area
the
chevrolet
tour
car
in
be
sell
at
though
with
its
extra
it
be
not
exactly
comparable
with
the
ford
the
ford
sedan
with
starter
and
demountable
rim
then
sell
at
the
chevrolet
k
model
at
chevrolet
s
dealer
discount
be
large
than
ford
s
which
make
a
difference
in
trading
chevrolet
s
internal
statement
of
policy
at
this
time
be
that
it
be
our
objective
to
get
a
public
reputation
for
give
more
for
the
dollar
than
ford
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
the
ford
and
chevrolet
be
consider
on
a
comparable
equipment
basis
the
ford
price
be
not
far
below
that
of
chevrolet
on
the
quality
side
we
propose
to
demonstrate
to
the
buyer
that
though
our
car
cost
x
dollar
more
it
be
x
plus
y
dollar
well
too
we
propose
to
improve
our
product
regularly
we
expect
ford
generally
speak
to
stay
put
we
set
this
plan
in
motion
and
it
work
as
forecast
nevertheless
despite
the
success
of
the
k
model
chevrolet
it
be
still
too
far
from
the
ford
model
t
in
price
for
the
gravitational
pull
we
hop
to
exert
in
mr
ford
s
area
of
the
market
it
be
our
intention
to
continue
add
improvement
and
over
a
period
of
time
to
move
down
in
price
on
the
model
t
as
our
position
justified
it
as
we
say
in
our
product
policy
of
any
give
car
be
related
to
other
car
that
impinge
upon
it
below
and
above
in
price
and
engineering
design
hence
when
look
at
the
chevrolet
in
relation
to
the
ford
below
it
it
be
logical
to
consider
equally
what
might
happen
to
chevrolet
as
a
result
of
similar
action
by
competitor
above
it
this
question
be
very
much
on
our
mind
while
the
chevrolet
k
model
sedan
be
be
prepared
during
the
year
and
for
good
reason
a
glance
at
the
general
motor
price
list
that
year
show
that
we
have
still
to
realize
the
ideal
or
theoretical
list
set
up
in
the
plan
the
list
for
the
still
dominant
tour
car
in
be
as
follow
chevrolet
old
oakland
buick
buick
and
cadillac
the
most
obvious
gap
in
this
line
be
between
the
cadillac
and
buick
at
the
top
and
between
the
chevrolet
and
old
at
the
bottom
to
fill
the
gap
between
the
standard
cadillac
and
the
buick
i
propose
that
cadillac
study
the
possibility
of
make
a
family
type
car
to
sell
at
about
which
eventually
result
in
the
famous
la
salle
car
introduce
in
from
the
strategic
standpoint
at
that
time
however
the
most
dangerous
gap
in
the
list
be
that
between
the
chevrolet
and
the
old
it
be
big
enough
to
constitute
a
volume
demand
and
thereby
to
accommodate
on
top
of
chevrolet
a
competitor
against
whom
we
then
have
no
counter
it
be
therefore
an
important
gap
to
fill
both
offensively
and
defensively
offensively
because
there
be
a
market
demand
to
be
satisfied
there
and
defensively
because
competitive
car
could
come
in
there
and
come
down
on
chevrolet
as
we
plan
for
chevrolet
to
come
down
on
ford
on
this
reason
we
make
one
of
the
most
important
decision
in
the
history
of
general
motor
namely
to
fill
the
gap
above
chevrolet
with
a
brand
new
car
with
a
new
six
cylinder
engine
we
have
come
to
believe
from
an
engineering
standpoint
that
the
future
favor
six
and
eight
however
to
make
the
strategy
effective
it
would
be
necessary
to
fill
the
gap
with
a
car
that
also
have
some
volume
economy
otherwise
because
the
new
car
would
draw
some
volume
away
from
chevrolet
reduce
its
economy
a
loss
would
result
for
both
car
we
conclude
therefore
that
the
new
car
must
be
design
in
physical
coordination
with
chevrolet
so
as
to
share
chevrolet
s
economy
and
vice
versa
the
idea
for
such
a

be
first
discuss
by
mr
hunt
mr
crane
and
myself
a
few
month
after
i
become
president
we
have
learn
something
of
value
in
try
to
make
dual
purpose
body
and
dual
purpose
chassis
for
the
copper
cool
and
water
cool
engine
in
the
period
of
uncertainty
in
those
matter
we
talk
now
about
the
development
of
a
six
cylinder
car
base
on
the
use
if
possible
of
such
chevrolet
body
and
chassis
part
as
would
fit
the
new
design
as
a
it
would
be
a
smoother
run
car
than
the
chevrolet
and
would
require
a
longer
wheel
base
great
engine
displacement
and
horsepower
and
increase
car
weight
a
longer
and
deeper
frame
a
heavier
front
axle
and
a
short
stroke
six
cylinder
l
head
engine
propose
by
mr
crane
be
the
principal
new
unit
in
the
design
while
the
corporation
s
engineering
committee
work
on
the
design
i
remain
uncertain
where
to
place
the
car
in
the
divisional
picture
mr
hannum
general
manager
of
oakland
write
to
me
propose
that
his
division
undertake
the
development
phase
of
the
work
my
reply
to
him
on
november
show
how
i
felt
about
the
new
car
then
from
the
point
of
view
of
coordination
with
chevrolet
and
of
competition
i
quote
your
letter
of
october
th
reach
me
in
detroit
but
i
do
not
have
you
will
remember
a
clear
viewpoint
with
relation
to
the
so
call
pontiac
car
i
have
be
in
a
way
up
in
the
air
on
the
pontiac
car
development
and
do
not
reply
to
your
letter
although
i
read
it
over
several
time
very
carefully
pending
a
crystallization
of
a
viewpoint
on
what
appear
to
be
the
best
policy
to
pursue
i
be
thoroughly
convince
and
have
be
from
the
begin
that
there
be
a
place
for
such
a
car
and
second
that
if
general
motor
didn
t
go
in
there
someone
else
sooner
or
later
would
if
the
whole
field
be
left
to
general
motor
i
do
not
know
as
i
would
be
so
anxious
about
it
but
of
course
fortunately
for
us
i
presume
it
be
not
therefore
we
must
give
weight
to
what
the
other
fellow
be
likely
to
do
one
very
difficult
thing
have
developed
in
all
the
discussion
there
have
be
and
that
be
the
tendency
to
get
away
from
the
chevrolet
part
of
the
idea
every
time
it
come
up
some
one
want
to
make
something
different
and
the
result
of
that
be
that
if
everybody
have
their
way
we
would
have
a
second
old
or
probably
an
oakland
car
more
likely
a
second
buick
or
cadillac
in
other
word
we
be
never
go
to
make
a
success
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
unless
we
st
i
ck
to
the
principle
namely
a
chevrolet
chassis
with
a
six
cylinder
engine
that
be
the
case
i
have
definitely
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
thing
to
do
in
order
to
work
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
be
to
have
the
development
undertaken
by
the
chevrolet
engineering
organization
because
in
so
do
there
will
be
every
tendency
to
use
what
we
can
of
chevrolet
as
against
the
other
method
the
tendency
to
use
something
different
due
to
the
natural
and
very
proper
tendency
of
an
independent
engineer
to
inject
his
own
personality
and
idea
into
the
picture
perhaps
to
the
detriment
of
the
car
but
certainly
not
to
the
detriment
of
this
particular
development
which
must
follow
along
chevrolet
line
if
we
be
go
to
capitalize
chevrolet
component
plant
and
assembly
plant
either
at
the
begin
or
at
some
future
date
when
volume
justifies
same
therefore
i
have
be
discuss
the
matter
with
mr
knudsen
and
feel
that
we
should
turn
over
to
mr
o
e
hunt
his
engineer
all
that
we
have
accomplish
let
him
weigh
it
carefully
let
him
undertake
to
work
out
for
us
a
six
cylinder
engine
along
constructive
line
recognize
as
he
do
what
the
picture
have
get
to
be
as
a
matter
of
fact
chevrolet
should
be
experiment
with
engine
development
on
its
own
account
and
these
two
thing
should
work
along
concurrently
on
the
same
day
i
crystallize
my
thought
on
the
subject
in
a
report
to
the
executive
committee
under
the
title
status
of
the
pontiac
car
so
call
i
quote
from
this
report
the
passage
relate
to
cost
competition
coordination
and
assignment
in
the
corporation
these
be
the
final
question
to
be
resolve
in
a
decision
mr
brown
have
have
his
staff
develop
some
cost
which
although
not
in
any
way
conclusive
appear
to
demonstrate
what
we
have
felt
be
reasonable
namely
that
even
load
the
cost
with
such
overhead
as
it
should
logically
carry
that
be
on
a
basis
of
equal
distribution
with
other
item
there
remains
consider
a
list
price
of
something
like
a
profit
which
will
give
us
a
very
excellent
return
on
the
capital
employ
this
data
have
be
laid
down
use
figure
on
the
old
engine
the
cost
of
which
we
know
to
be
excessive
and
which
for
that
reason
will
probably
not
be
use
look
at
the
development
from
the
standpoint
of
the
economic
cost
or
real
profit
to
the
stockholder
the
result
be
very
satisfactory
and
of
such
a
nature
as
really
require
us
to
go
ahead
in
addition
to
the
above
information
not
conclusive
seem
to
indicate
that
one
or
two
of
our
competitor
be
go
to
attempt
the
same
thing
which
brings
us
to
the
consideration
that
although
this
development
will
probably
take
business
from
both
old
and
chevrolet
it
will
be
well
that
we
take
business
from
our
own
division
than
have
competitor
do
so
it
look
now
as
if
both
thing
would
ultimately
happen
we
have
be
work
on
this
proposition
for
about
a
year
and
i
be
frank
to
say
we
have
make
little
headway
it
seem
as
if
every
time
we
bring
it
up
for
discussion
that
an
uncertainty
develops
in
the
mind
of
the
executive
committee
as
to
its
practicability
i
have
come
to
the
definite
conclusion
that
we
be
never
go
to
get
anywhere
along
the
line
we
must
proceed
to
make
it
a
success
if
we
have
it
developed
by
an
independent
engineering
department
or
by
the
oakland
division
where
it
be
originally
start
i
be
far
definitely
of
the
opinion
that
the
only
chance
for
success
be
to
have
it
developed
in
the
chevrolet
division
under
such
auspex
coordination
as
to
the
chassis
will
come
about
as
a
natural
course
of
event
and
there
will
be
no
tendency
to
introduce
this
and
that
difference
simply
because
the
engineer
wish
very
naturally
and
properly
to
inject
his
own
personality
into
the
picture
in
other
word
it
will
logically
follow
a
development
it
have
get
to
follow
if
we
be
to
come
through
at
all
the
thing
especially
worth
note
in
this
report
be
the
consideration
give
to
the
question
of
coordinate
the
manufacture
of
one
car
with
another
for
the
pontiac
represent
the
first
important
advance
in
coordinate
the
physical
product
in
manufacturing
physical
coordination
in
one
form
or
another
be
of
course
the
first
principle
of
mass
production
but
at
that
time
it
be
widely
suppose
from
the
example
of
the
model
t
that
mass
production
on
a
grand
scale
require
a
uniform
product
the
pontiac
coordinate
in
part
with
a
car
in
another
price
class
be
to
demonstrate
that
mass
production
of
automobile
could
he
reconcile
with
variety
in
product
this
be
again
the
opposite
of
the
old
ford
concept
which
we
persistently
met
and
oppose
at
every
turn
for
general
motor
with
its
five
basic
price
class
by
car
make
and
several
subclass
of
model
the
implication
of
the
pontiac
idea
be
very
great
for
the
whole
line
if
the
car
in
the
high
price
class
could
benefit
from
the
volume
economy
of
the
low
price
class
the
advantage
of
mass
production
could
be
extend
to
the
whole
car
line
this
give
new
significance
to
the
product
plan
of
and
be
in
fact
eventually
apply
in
vary
degree
by
all
the
general
motor
car
division
the
propose
pontiac
be
assemble
and
road
test
at
chevrolet
and
then
assign
back
to
oakland
with
full
responsibility
to
that
division
for
its
final
development
production
and
ultimate
sale
as
a
companion
car
to
the
oakland
we
schedule
it
for
the
model
year
during
the
time
of
this
development
another
more
or
less
independent
event
take
place
which
be
profoundly
to
influence
the
fortune
of
the
pontiac
the
chevrolet
and
the
model
t
in
roy
chapin
of
the
hudson
motor
company
have
introduce
the
essex
coach
at
a
price
of
or
above
the
essex
tour
car
this
be
a
relatively
small
price
difference
for
the
close
body
than
have
be
the
case
for
the
line
of
other
manufacturer
by
the
essex
coach
have
be
reduce
to
early
in
the
essex
supersede
the
and
come
on
the
market
at
a
price
of
for
the
coach
model
which
be
over
the
tour
car
price
in
june
of
that
year
price
be
increase
to
for
the
coach
and
for
the
tour
car
then
begin
in
mr
chapin
cut
the
price
of
the
coach
model
to
or
below
the
tour
car
model
nothing
like
that
have
ever
be
see
before
in
the
automobile
industry
and
the
essex
coach
have
a
considerable
vogue
this
suggest
that
close
car
price
on
a
volume
basis
could
in
the
future
dominate
even
the
low
price
field
such
a
development
doubtless
be
inevitable
but
in
fact
the
essex
competition
stimulate
us
in
two
matter
at
once
first
our
general
close
body
development
and
second
our
preparation
for
the
forthcoming
pontiac
car
general
motor
have
already
be
change
over
to
close
body
on
september
the
executive
committee
express
the
sentiment
that
our
manager
should
be
caution
to
be
very
careful
about
open
car
schedule
as
the
trend
seem
to
be
very
rapidly
turn
to
close
job
in
october
we
raise
the
proportion
of
our
production
of
close
car
from
about
percent
where
it
have
be
for
most
of
that
year
to
percent
for
november
a
year
later
at
the
end
of
the
proportion
of
close
car
production
for
the
corporation
as
a
whole
be
up
to
almost
percent
i
do
not
recall
that
the
essex
coach
influence
the
pontiac
program
directly
but
the
essex
and
the
future
pontiac
be
clearly
to
be
competitor
and
in
point
of
fact
we
design
our
first
pontiac
car
exclusively
with
close
body
a
coupe
and
a
coach
in
the
executive
committee
meeting
of
september
i
report
confidently
when
the
pontiac
car
come
out
in
december
it
will
give
us
everything
for
which
we
have
be
work
namely
the
low
price
cylinder
car
that
be
possible
construct
with
chevrolet
part
at
the
executive
committee
meeting
of
october
i
report
on
the
overall
situation
of
grow
tension
in
the
market
from
the
minute
of
the
meeting
i
glean
the
follow
attention
be
call
to
the
fact
that
the
essex
be
attack
the
chevrolet
market
from
the
top
while
the
ford
company
whose
policy
now
seem
to
be
that
of
improve
the
quality
of
its
car
rather
than
reduce
the
price
be
a
strong
competitor
on
the
other
side
the
pontiac
go
on
the
market
on
schedule
for
the
model
year
with
the
coach
price
at
that
be
about
halfway
between
the
chevrolet
coach
price
at
and
the
old
coach
price
at
and
the
gap
in
our
car
line
be
close
that
event
settle
general
motor
basic
car
position
for
many
year
the
cadillac
and
the
buick
be
first
and
second
from
the
top
of
the
price
pyramid
chevrolet
be
always
the
base
of
the
pyramid
the
oakland
organization
which
produce
the
pontiac
car
later
become
the
pontiac
division
and
the
manufacture
of
oakland
car
be
discontinue
the
pontiac
become
a
distinctive
car
in
its
own
right
while
maintain
its
original
economy
that
put
old
between
pontiac
and
buick
make
the
basic
price
line
chevrolet
pontiac
old
buick
and
cadillac
more
or
less
as
it
be
today
i
shall
not
deal
here
with
the
evolution
of
all
the
car
in
the
line
in
the
s
i
observe
only
that
old
and
oakland
be
not
very
lively
line
buick
though
always
basically
strong
have
its
ups
and
down
cadillac
as
always
be
strong
in
its
price
class
though
it
be
supersede
as
sale
leader
for
a
time
begin
in
i
pas
over
the
interest
record
of
these
division
to
concentrate
upon
the
most
important
change
that
take
place
in
that
period
namely
those
in
the
low
price
high
volume
area
where
we
be
seek
a
position
against
ford
the
last
decisive
element
in
this
competition
i
believe
be
the
close
body
which
itself
be
by
far
the
large
single
leap
forward
in
the
history
of
the
automobile
since
the
basic
car
have
be
make
mechanically
reliable
the
close
body
expand
the
use
of
the
automobile
by
make
it
a
comfortable
all
year
round
vehicle
and
add
substantially
to
the
price
of
the
product
the
model
k
chevrolet
coach
sell
for
percent
and
the
sedan
for
percent
more
than
the
roadster
although
the
essex
be
the
first
spectacular
demonstration
of
volume
production
of
a
close
car
at
a
price
comparable
to
an
open
car
the
price
of
both
essex
car
be
still
relatively
high
the
essex
threaten
the
chevrolet
from
the
top
but
be
not
really
in
the
low
price
field
although
chevrolet
in
be
still
high
price
than
ford
it
have
a
very
good
position
in
the
low
price
close
car
field
partly
because
of
its
relationship
to
fisher
body
a
few
word
about
fisher
body
which
have
the
responsibility
for
building
most
of
general
motor
car
body
general
motor
as
i
say
earlier
acquire
a
percent
interest
in
the
fisher
body
corporation
in
with
arrangement
that
fisher
supply
all
general
motor
passenger
car
body
requirement
that
it
could
in
we
purchase
the
remain
percent
interest
in
fisher
body
and
absorbed
it
into
general
motor
as
a
division
there
be
a
number
of
reason
for
do
this
as
early
as
february
in
the
executive
committee
attention
be
call
to
the
fact
that
chevrolet
s
sale
be
at
present
limited
by
its
ability
to
produce
new
model
which
be
largely
determine
by
the
ability
of
fisher
body
corporation
to
supply
close
body
there
be
operating
economy
to
be
gain
by
coordinate
body
and
chassis
assembly
and
with
the
close
body
become
dominant
in
the
industry
it
seem
sensible
to
bring
the
body
operation
entirely
under
the
general
motor
roof
and
it
be
felt
desirable
also
to
bring
the
fisher
brother
into
closer
relationship
with
our
organization
the
story
of
the
fisher
brother
be
a
remarkable
family
saga
which
i
hope
they
will
sometime
record
i
do
not
know
it
far
back
by
personal
association
since
i
come
into
the
industry
through
the
chassis
so
to
speak
while
they
be
fabricate
body
but
i
knew
of
them
as
skilled
artisan
with
a
background
in
the
carriage
industry
the
fisher
body
company
be
organize
in
the
fisher
close
body
company
with
an
order
for
cadillac
body
in
and
the
fisher
body
company
of
canada
in
the
three
company
be
brought
together
in
the
fisher
body
corporation
in
they
have
make
body
for
several
automobile
company
include
buick
and
cadillac
i
first
come
to
know
fred
j
fisher
well
when
he
come
on
the
general
motor
executive
committee
in
and
he
be
a
value
member
of
that
early
team
in
he
be
make
a
member
of
the
finance
committee
in
that
year
charles
t
and
lawrence
p
fisher
be
make
member
of
the
executive
committee
and
in
i
appoint
the
latter
to
head
cadillac
the
other
brother
william
a
edward
f
and
alfred
j
remain
with
fisher
body
corporation
with
william
a
as
its
president
lawrence
p
fisher
played
an
outstanding
part
in
the
evolution
of
style
in
general
motor
a
story
i
tell
in
a
later
chapter
as
the
close
body
developed
rapidly
from
percent
of
the
industry
in
to
percent
in
and
percent
in
chevrolet
s
percentage
of
close
body
production
rise
from
about
percent
in
to
percent
in
and
on
to
percent
in
a
big
change
in
every
respect
the
rise
of
the
close
body
make
it
impossible
for
mr
ford
to
maintain
his
lead
position
in
the
low
price
field
for
he
have
frozen
his
policy
in
the
model
t
and
the
model
t
be
pre
eminently
an
open
car
design
with
its
light
chassis
it
be
unsuited
to
the
heavier
close
body
and
so
in
less
than
two
year
the
close
body
make
the
already
obsolesce
design
of
the
model
t
noncompetitive
as
an
engineering
design
mr
ford
nevertheless
put
close
body
on
the
model
t
and
sell
percent
of
his
production
in
this
form
in
although
the
market
for
close
body
rise
sharply
in
the
next
three
year
he
sell
only
percent
in
and
only
percent
in
while
chevrolet
s
sale
of
close
body
during
that
period
rise
to
percent
from
to
the
chevrolet
as
its
cost
position
justified
a
low
price
become
more
competitive
with
ford
as
we
have
hop
the
chevrolet
two
door
coach
go
in
that
period
progressively
from
to
to
to
while
the
ford
tudor
model
t
go
from
in
to
in
june
and
to
in
thus
the
old
strategic
plan
of
be
vindicate
to
a
t
so
to
speak
but
in
a
surprising
way
as
to
the
particular
the
old
master
have
fail
to
master
change
don
t
ask
me
why
there
be
a
legend
cultivate
by
sentimentalist
that
mr
ford
left
behind
a
great
car
expressive
of
the
pure
concept
of
cheap
basic
transportation
the
fact
be
that
he
left
behind
a
car
that
no
longer
offer
the
best
buy
even
as
raw
basic
transportation
it
be
not
difficult
to
see
in
and
that
chevrolet
be
closing
in
on
ford
in
chevrolet
have
about
u
s
factory
sale
of
car
and
truck
while
ford
have
approximately
two
million
factory
sale
in
chevrolet
move
up
to
about
factory
sale
of
car
and
truck
while
ford
move
down
to
about
his
precious
volume
which
be
the
foundation
of
his
position
be
fast
disappear
he
could
not
continue
lose
sale
and
maintain
his
profit
and
so
for
engineering
and
market
reason
the
model
t
fell
and
yet
not
many
observer
expect
so
catastrophic
and
almost
whimsical
a
fall
as
mr
ford
chose
to
take
in
may
when
he
shut
down
his
great
river
rouge
plant
completely
and
kept
it
shut
down
for
nearly
a
year
to
retool
leave
the
field
to
chevrolet
unopposed
and
opening
it
up
for
mr
chrysler
s
plymouth
mr
ford
regain
sale
leadership
again
in
and
but
speak
in
term
of
generality
he
have
lose
the
lead
to
general
motor
mr
ford
who
have
have
so
many
brilliant
insight
in
earlier
year
seem
never
to
understand
how
completely
the
market
have
change
from
the
one
in
which
he
make
his
name
and
to
which
he
be
accustom
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
first
four
million
car
and
truck
year
from
then
to
set
aside
variation
in
the
year
there
be
a
seven
year
plateau
in
new
car
sale
and
yet
the
total
number
of
car
in
use
as
i
have
show
continued
to
rise
while
the
total
market
include
use
car
expand
the
new
car
market
level
off
and
as
i
have
say
the
role
of
the
new
car
be
to
cover
scrappage
and
growth
in
car
ownership
meanwhile
the
use
car
at
much
low
price
drop
down
to
fill
the
demand
at
various
level
for
basic
transportation
mr
ford
fail
to
realize
that
it
be
not
necessary
for
new
car
to
meet
the
need
for
basic
transportation
on
this
basis
alone
mr
ford
s
concept
of
the
american
market
do
not
adequately
fit
the
reality
after
the
basic
transportation
market
in
the
united
state
unlike
europe
since
then
have
be
met
mainly
by
the
use
car
when
first
car
buyer
return
to
the
market
for
the
second
round
with
the
old
car
as
a
first
payment
on
the
new
car
they
be
sell
basic
transportation
and
demand
something
more
than
that
in
the
new
car
middle
income
buyer
assist
by
the
trade
in
and
installment
financing
create
the
demand
not
for
basic
transportation
but
for
progress
in
new
car
for
comfort
convenience
power
and
style
this
be
the
actual
trend
of
american
life
and
those
who
adapt
to
it
prosper
it
be
thus
that
the
four
element
with
which
i
begin
the
discussion
in
this
chapter
installment
sell
the
use
car
trade
in
the
close
car
body
and
the
annual
model
interact
in
the
s
to
transform
the
market
but
i
have
not
complete
the
picture
what
of
the
annual
model
the
annual
model
be
not
a
declare
policy
of
general
motor
nor
of
anyone
i
believe
in
the
s
it
be
however
inherent
in
the
policy
of
create
a
big
and
well
package
each
year
with
this
concept
necessarily
go
the
need
for
salesmanship
at
a
general
sale
committee
meeting
on
july
i
state
our
commercial
policy
as
follow
we
have
elect
as
a
large
corporation
to
build
quality
product
sell
at
fair
price
and
while
there
be
others
in
the
industry
who
do
not
follow
quite
this
policy
i
be
sure
that
we
be
in
pretty
general
agreement
that
it
be
the
correct
policy
at
the
same
time
however
we
must
admit
that
such
a
policy
throw
the
add
responsibility
upon
our
sale
department
to
get
the
cost
of
quality
plus
a
profit
on
quality
in
justice
to
our
sale
department
it
be
a
fact
that
we
have
be
handicapped
by
past
reputation
in
connection
with
certain
of
our
product
but
as
we
pas
into
our
new
manufacturing
year
we
have
a
line
of
car
that
we
can
be
proud
of
without
exception
i
believe
that
we
will
all
agree
that
these
new
product
be
thoroughly
dependable
and
price
in
the
proper
level
both
competitively
and
from
the
standpoint
of
cost
some
of
the
reduction
in
sale
price
have
come
out
of
saving
in
cost
particularly
in
close
body
as
a
result
of
fisher
s
increase
volume
other
saving
have
be
effect
through
change
in
design
which
have
not
affected
quality
at
the
same
time
however
it
must
be
recognize
that
we
have
reduce
our
profit
to
give
some
idea
of
what
this
mean
i
might
say
that
if
we
take
our
earnings
for
the
past
six
month
of
and
re
figure
these
earnings
on
the
basis
of
the
new
list
price
and
the
new
cost
in
other
word
the
new
spread
between
cost
and
sell
price
and
assume
the
volume
to
be
the
same
we
would
have
reduce
our
profit
by
about
twenty
five
percent
as
we
be
now
run
general
motor
hasn
t
increase
its
volume
of
business
very
much
our
success
during
the
first
half
of
the
year
result
from
a
favorable
margin
between
cost
and
sell
price
our
sale
to
consumer
so
far
this
year
be
just
about
the
same
as
last
year
and
while
our
price
have
not
be
out
of
line
except
in
a
few
instance
our
price
line
up
as
of
august
first
should
certainly
place
us
in
a
position
to
expand
our
sale
in
relation
to
competition
in
fact
the
only
justification
for
our
new
price
as
i
see
it
be
on
the
assumption
that
we
be
go
to
get
add
volume
and
this
add
volume
will
mean
a
great
responsibility
on
our
sale
department
with
our
present
line
up
as
regard
price
and
quality
we
must
agree
that
it
be
a
question
of
sell
directly
up
to
our
sale
organization
i
then
give
a
pep
talk
on
avoid
inertia
in
large
scale
operation
and
conclude
my
remark
on
commercial
policy
with
the
observation
that
the
industry
have
at
that
time
enter
a
new
period
there
be
many
thing
in
connection
with
marketing
concern
which
we
should
be
more
progressive
and
aggressive
in
my
judgment
general
motor
as
a
whole
be
relatively
weak
in
sale
endeavor
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
entire
automobile
industry
have
be
built
up
by
and
around
people
of
mechanical
and
technical
characteristic
rather
than
commercial
and
i
think
we
be
just
begin
to
realize
the
great
importance
of
the
commercial
side
of
the
business
as
event
prove
i
be
mistaken
in
worry
about
the
inertia
of
general
motor
like
a
football
coach
roast
a
championship
team
the
word
quality
product
sell
at
fair
price
described
the
basic
policy
of
sell
the
big
and
well
car
a
policy
consistent
with
the
product
plan
of
along
with
this
go
a
policy
of
building
strong
dealer
organization
in
each
of
the
division
we
believe
it
be
essential
to
have
a
prosperous
energetic
strategically
locate
body
of
dealer
to
do
the
sell
and
the
trading
there
be
a
chapter
on
that
subject
later
on
so
it
be
all
of
a
piece
you
start
on
a
course
with
a
policy
and
thing
not
foreseen
fell
into
place
when
it
come
to
the
product
the
policy
meant
continuous
eternal
change
i
have
described
some
of
the
change
we
make
in
the
k
model
chevrolet
in
in
that
same
year
we
begin
work
on
a
new
six
cylinder
chevrolet
engine
in
in
the
cadillac
division
we
introduce
style
as
a
separate
concept
and
for
the
first
time
as
a
specialization
in
the
industry
in
and
we
make
style
change
in
chevrolet
in
we
put
four
wheel
brake
on
the
chevrolet
and
lengthen
its
wheel
base
by
four
inch
for
the
new
six
cylinder
engine
but
we
held
off
the
new
engine
until
after
mr
ford
have
come
out
with
his
four
cylinder
model
a
at
the
general
sale
committee
meeting
on
july
mention
above
we
call
our
new
car
annual
model
but
do
our
best
to
avoid
a
formal
commitment
to
the
concept
the
record
of
this
discussion
be
entitle
annual
model
versus
constant
improvement
the
colloquy
that
take
place
under
this
head
the
only
one
i
have
a
record
of
in
the
s
may
be
of
some
interest
mr
sloan
while
the
bring
out
of
yearly
model
result
in
many
disadvantage
and
for
that
reason
we
be
all
against
yearly
model
i
don
t
see
just
what
can
be
do
about
it
mr
richard
h
grant
general
sale
manager
of
chevrolet
i
be
against
the
yearly
model
idea
and
i
think
that
instead
of
hold
up
our
improvement
until
some
give
date
of
the
year
we
should
work
them
in
gradually
and
say
nothing
about
them
mr
sloan
of
course
that
might
be
best
in
connection
with
some
change
but
in
the
case
of
a
different
body
it
present
serious
difficulty
mr
grant
the
question
be
shall
we
have
yearly
model
i
say
no
we
should
not
have
yearly
model
we
ought
to
make
all
invisible
change
without
announcement
now
when
we
change
the
line
or
change
the
body
then
i
think
we
have
to
have
a
new
model
but
i
don
t
think
there
should
be
anything
yearly
about
it
it
might
be
a
year
and
seven
month
or
two
year
between
the
introduction
of
model
i
don
t
feel
we
should
concentrate
everything
on
the
first
of
august
on
the
other
hand
i
don
t
think
we
ought
to
follow
the
dodge
policy
and
say
we
will
never
have
any
new
model
mr
sloan
when
you
adopt
their
policy
you
be
just
say
that
industry
do
not
develop
although
you
can
make
a
few
minor
change
the
time
certainly
come
when
you
be
force
to
bring
out
a
new
model
you
can
say
you
be
not
go
to
do
it
but
you
will
have
to
do
it
sooner
or
later
the
only
two
concern
who
have
successfully
follow
that
policy
be
dodge
and
ford
now
ford
be
bring
out
a
new
model
for
the
very
reason
we
be
talk
about
he
have
be
driven
to
it
dodge
be
driven
to
it
in
the
begin
of
the
state
report
on
new
car
registration
show
how
they
have
be
slip
now
we
be
all
in
the
same
fix
and
i
think
general
motor
as
a
policy
have
be
too
easily
influence
to
make
change
but
i
think
that
be
due
to
the
fact
that
our
product
be
not
sufficiently
stabilize
mr
grant
maybe
the
way
this
be
put
up
here
be
a
little
confuse
if
this
mean
that
if
we
have
a
bang
up
new
model
to
bring
out
and
weren
t
go
to
capitalize
on
it
then
i
be
not
in
harmony
with
it
but
i
do
believe
that
the
thought
of
the
yearly
model
ought
to
be
gotten
away
from
and
we
should
only
bring
out
a
model
when
we
have
a
necessity
of
bring
it
out
and
then
we
should
handle
it
to
our
best
advantage
and
advertise
it
i
think
the
people
who
be
advertising
this
policy
of
not
eve
r
bring
out
a
new
model
be
store
up
a
lot
of
grief
for
themselves
line
be
go
to
change
and
body
be
go
to
change
mr
lynn
mcnaughton
general
sale
manager
of
cadillac
we
have
felt
in
get
away
from
the
name
of
a
model
we
might
get
the
attention
of
the
public
on
the
name
cadillac
instead
of
the
designation
of
the
model
and
we
be
not
go
to
call
the
new
car
by
any
model
name
but
it
be
just
a
new
line
of
cadillac
car
for
the
past
three
or
four
month
people
have
ask
us
when
we
be
go
to
bring
out
the
new
v
but
we
be
not
go
to
have
anything
else
except
so
far
as
the
public
be
concerned
a
new
line
of
cadillac
car
without
model
designation
we
be
go
to
advertise
the
cadillac
instead
of
the
model
mr
sloan
of
course
there
be
one
thing
about
it
from
the
fisher
body
standpoint
the
strain
on
their
organization
in
bring
out
all
these
dy
at
one
time
be
something
terrific
and
well
nigh
impossible
mr
grant
i
think
what
we
ought
to
do
be
change
our
method
of
handle
our
policy
and
i
think
we
ought
to
get
a
new
model
out
when
we
have
an
advantage
in
get
a
new
model
out
but
i
don
t
think
we
ought
to
set
a
date
of
august
first
and
i
don
t
think
if
we
be
go
to
have
change
in
two
different
division
they
should
necessarily
come
out
on
august
st
it
might
serve
one
division
well
to
come
out
january
st
like
we
do
last
year
mr
sloan
you
be
really
force
to
change
on
august
st
because
any
other
date
run
into
your
sell
season
it
must
be
do
between
august
st
and
november
st
you
certainly
wouldn
t
want
to
come
out
january
st
as
a
matter
of
policy
unless
you
be
driven
to
it
as
chevrolet
be
last
year
mr
grant
it
look
this
year
from
the
way
we
be
head
january
st
might
be
a
good
time
yet
you
take
the
year
after
that
it
might
be
the
poorest
time
because
i
don
t
think
we
be
go
to
have
much
stock
on
hand
january
st
mr
dan
s
eddins
general
sale
manager
of
old
if
we
could
throw
a
new
model
in
production
the
first
of
december
we
would
build
up
the
stock
by
spring
to
meet
the
spring
demand
but
from
january
st
to
february
st
your
plant
can
t
get
underway
on
the
other
hand
other
manufacturer
bring
in
their
line
on
august
st
would
beat
us
to
it
and
get
a
lot
of
our
business
mr
sloan
between
august
st
and
september
st
be
about
the
only
logical
time
because
if
you
move
it
back
from
august
st
you
will
minimize
your
spring
business
and
if
you
attempt
to
change
on
november
st
there
will
be
thousand
of
car
on
the
hand
of
your
dealer
which
will
be
very
hard
to
sell
you
would
have
to
liquidate
your
merchandise
in
an
off
season
mr
grant
i
think
we
ought
to
keep
our
policy
just
as
it
be
but
work
to
the
end
of
avoid
as
many
drastic
model
change
as
we
can
in
other
word
we
should
change
our
method
of
manipulate
the
present
policy
general
motor
in
fact
have
annual
model
in
the
twenty
every
year
after
and
have
have
them
ever
since
but
as
the
discussion
above
show
we
have
not
in
formulate
the
concept
in
the
way
it
be
know
today
when
we
do
formulate
it
i
cannot
say
it
be
a
matter
of
evolution
eventually
the
fact
that
we
make
yearly
change
and
the
recognition
of
the
necessity
of
change
force
us
into
regularize
change
when
change
become
regularize
some
time
in
the
s
we
begin
to
speak
of
annual
model
i
do
not
believe
the
elder
mr
ford
ever
really
care
for
the
idea
anyway
his
model
a
which
he
brought
out
in
as
fine
a
little
car
as
it
be
in
its
time
it
seem
to
me
be
another
expression
of
his
concept
of
a
static
model
utility
car
at
the
time
when
ford
s
plant
be
shut
down
for
lack
of
a
new
model
design
i
thought
that
both
his
and
our
policy
would
survive
ford
s
in
the
form
of
the
new
car
which
would
express
the
old
policy
adapt
to
the
then
high
state
of
the
art
in
other
word
i
have
no
idea
in
that
the
old
ford
policy
be
wash
out
and
that
the
general
motor
policy
of
upgraded
car
have
won
in
a
much
large
sense
than
be
reflect
in
the
rise
in
sale
of
chevrolet
chapter
policy
creation
the
transformation
of
the
automobile
market
be
essentially
complete
in
if
mr
ford
in
that
pivotal
year
in
the
modern
economy
still
held
stubbornly
to
his
old
concept
in
his
new
model
a
he
be
counterbalance
by
mr
chrysler
who
have
come
up
from
nowhere
with
tremendous
vitality
and
with
a
market
policy
similar
to
general
motor
the
fact
that
mr
ford
built
nearly
two
million
of
the
five
million
u
s
produce
car
and
truck
sell
that
year
be
only
incidental
from
the
long
term
point
of
view
it
be
a
splurge
not
the
sign
of
a
trend
and
general
motor
itself
have
be
transform
from
the
formless
aggregation
of
into
an
integrate
effective
enterprise
its
management
philosophy
of
decentralization
with
coordinate
control
be
work
adequately
for
its
time
its
financial
method
have
become
a
kind
of
second
nature
and
a
constantly
evolve
creative
process
its
line
of
car
express
the
variety
that
mr
durant
have
originate
and
in
principle
the
price
class
set
forth
in
the
product
plan
of
and
perhaps
i
should
add
in
passing
that
although
we
have
reach
an
all
time
peak
in
the
export
of
car
we
have
start
on
a
new
course
overseas
with
our
own
manufacturing
operation
in
england
and
germany
in
all
of
these
matter
the
corporation
reflect
the
trend
of
affair
in
the
economy
doubtless
it
influence
some
of
those
trend
our
progress
in
the
automobile
industry
influence
other
large
scale
american
enterprise
to
study
and
adopt
our
method
particularly
decentralization
and
financial
control
not
be
a
historian
i
pas
over
much
in
this
period
that
be
of
general
interest
to
continue
the
story
i
set
out
to
tell
about
the
progress
of
general
motor
the
great
depression
of
the
early
s
despite
its
contract
effect
do
not
alter
qualitatively
the
general
characteristic
of
the
enterprise
except
in
one
particular
contraction
require
increase
coordination
that
be
we
have
to
find
way
to
react
swiftly
to
this
most
difficult
kind
of
change
and
to
economize
these
need
be
to
lead
to
the
last
basic
modification
in
the
general
motor
scheme
of
organization
in
fact
the
change
begin
before
the
stock
market
crash
in
october
in
anticipation
of
a
new
situation
but
before
we
have
any
real
idea
of
what
be
come
for
one
thing
because
of
the
tremendous
success
of
chevrolet
i
want
to
spread
the
benefit
of
its
management
to
the

a
whole

knudsen
who
have
be
general
manager
of
chevrolet
be
elect
an
executive
vice
president
and
put
in
charge
of
all
car
truck
and
body
manufacturing
operation
thus
it
might
be
say
that
in
this
period
a
new
executive
group
move
up
in
rank
and
into
the
general
corporate
area
where
their
influence
would
affect
the
entire
corporation
we
have
at
that
time
however
only
a
modest
staff
organization
outside
of
finance
mr
kettering
s
laboratory
and
the
work
associate
with
the
interdivisional
committee
when
we
have
occasion
for
an
advanced
engineering
project
we
create
a
special
product
study
group
and
place
it
in
a
manufacturing
division
the
election
of
these
men
therefore
be
a
new
begin
in
staff
activity
which
would
eventually
displace
the
old
interdivisional
committee
and
develop
into
the
great
staff
organization
we
have
today
the
story
of
these
staff
belong
to
later
chapter
in
this
book
i
shall
discus
here
only
how
they
bear
upon
certain
general
development
in
coordination
the
national
economy
reach
its
peak
up
to
that
time
in
the
late
spring
and
early
summer
of
after
which
industrial
production
decrease
sharply
while
the
stock
market
continued
on
and
up
to
its
debacle
in
october
on
july
i
make
a
statement
to
the
operation
committee
express
anxiety
as
to
whether
the
corporation
be
capable
of
react
to
change
and
declare
myself
for
new
form
of
coordination
to
that
end
as
follow
the
index
of
industrial
production
for
be
at
the
end
of
chapter
i
feel
that
we
have
be
weak
in
that
we
have
not
be
in
a
position
or
have
not
perhaps
from
the
standpoint
of
policy
follow
through
on
the
many
constructive
suggestion
involve
program
and
policy
that
have
be
developed
the
usual
reaction
in
the
mind
of
all
of
us
be
against
any
change
and
i
feel
that
our
administration
have
be
subject
to
criticism
for
not
insist
upon
change
and
lose
too
much
time
in
sell
an
idea
and
in
not
deal
promptly
and
effectively
with
weakness
that
be
know
to
exist
it
be
for
that
reason
that
i
have
felt
for
some
time
past
that
we
must
have
a
more
effective
and
definite
form
of
coordination
express
otherwise
the
resistance
against
progress
have
be
great
than
the
man
power
to
effect
progress
therefore
progress
have
be
slow
this
now
i
feel
have
get
to
be
change
if
the
corporation
be
go
to
maintain
its
position
let
alone
improve
it
we
can
not
wait
so
long
to
do
thing
as
we
have
because
competition
be
become
keener
and
the
problem
be
daily
become
harder
the
remark
i
be
make
be
not
direct
so
much
to
the
ordinary
business
routine
as
they
be
to
the
recognition
of
new
necessity
in
the
form
of
well
general
principle
and
policy
to
carry
out
those
principle
also
well
and
more
effective
form
of
detail
organization
on
october
shortly
before
the
stock
market
crash
i
address
a
general
letter
to
the
organization
note
the
end
of
expansion
and
promulgate
a
new
policy
of
economy
for
the
corporation
it
appear
to
me
that
it
would
be
most
appropriate
at
this
time
to
ask
the
earnest
attention
of
all
concerned
to
what
i
believe
to
be
a
very
important
problem
and
which
i
will
outline
herewith
for
quite
a
number
of
year
past
the
demand
on
our
schedule
have
taxed
our
facility
to
the
utmost
this
applies
to
practically
all
operation
both
at
home
and
abroad
in
addition
to
this
the
character
of
our
product
have
materially
change
and
such
change
necessitate
a
revision
of
some
of
our
production
facility
and
modify
more
or
less
practically
all
of
them
this
have
thrown
on
management
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
problem
the
responsibility
of
provide
plant
and
facility
for
expansion
and
the
organization
to
effectively
operate
same
in
connection
with
the
above
program
large
amount
of
capital
have
be
expend
still
more
have
be
invest
in
create
facility
for
do
thing
that
have
not
be
previously
do
in
other
word
develop
plant
for
manufacturing
a
great
part
of
the
various
product
we
be
sell
all
this
have
be
constructive
and
amply
justified
by
the
result
that
have
be
obtain
i
be
sure
our
position
in
the
past
and
present
have
be
and
in
the
future
will
be
greatly
enhance
and
strengthen
by
what
we
have
accomplish
in
this
general
direction
the
purpose
of
the
above
be
to
make
the
point
that
in
my
opinion
a
different
type
of
treatment
be
now
essential
at
least
for
the
present
and
for
the
more
or
less
immediate
future
it
seem
to
me
that
management
should
now
direct
its
energy
toward
increase
earn
power
through
improve
effectiveness
and
reduce
expense
in
other
word
the
drive
during
the
past
few
year
have
be
for
more
and
well
car
of
constantly
increase
value
from
now
on
we
should
drive
just
as
hard
toward
still
well
car
but
we
must
give
more
detailed
consideration
to
value
in
respect
to
price
and
as
a
part
of
this
program
the
effort
that
have
be
so
lavishly
expend
on
expansion
and
development
should
now
be
direct
toward
economy
in
operation
the
above
do
not
mean
to
convey
the
thought
that
our
trend
over
a
period
of
year
will
be
other
than
of
such
a
nature
that
still
far
demand
on
our
production
facility
will
be
require
i
believe
that
give
a
quality
product
at
the
right
price
at
the
same
time
keep
abreast
of
the
advance
in
engineering
thought
there
be
no
end
to
what
we
can
accomplish
on
the
other
hand
it
be
impossible
to
assume
that
the
percentage
increase
from
year
to
year
will
equal
what
we
have
enjoy
during
the
recent
past
far
it
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
we
must
follow
more
closely
the
general
trend
of
industry
as
a
whole
i
do
not
intend
to
convey
the
thought
in
anything
that
be
say
above
that
the
expense
factor
have
not
be
watch
for
i
know
it
have
what
i
be
try
to
convey
be
the
thought
that
in
the
future
it
should
be
the
prime
consideration
of
every
division
and
subsidiary
to
put
the
energy
previously
direct
toward
expansion
and
development
into
the
hardest
kind
of
a
drive
in
the
direction
of
economy
in
other
word
economy
in
operation
must
now
be
the
key
note
rather
than
expansion
of
plant
and
equipment
by
expense
i
mean
not
only
manufacturing
expense
but
every
item
of
expense
incident
to
cost
of
sale
the
responsibility
of
carry
through
this
program
rest
of
course
on
every
division
and
subsidiary
in
order
that
i
may
be
kept
in
touch
with
the
general
trend
i
be
ask
messrs
bradley
grant
hunt
and
wilson
to
study
the
situation
from
the
staff
standpoint
in
collaboration
with
the
correspond
function
in
the
various
division
and
subsidiary
in
various
way
that
will
be
outline
in
due
course
in
that
way
we
will
all
work
together
toward
a
well
general
result
in
harmony
with
the
thought
behind
the
above
it
follow
that
new
project
should
be
more
carefully
scrutinize
than
ever
before
and
the
burden
of
proof
of
their
propriety
should
be
more
evident
accord
to
the
present
form
of
organization
c
e
wilson
vice
president
deal
in
a
preliminary
way
with
new
project
as
present
it
might
be
desirable
for
every
division
and
subsidiary
contemplate
or
feel
the
necessity
of
far
expansion
to
consult
mr
wilson
before
proceed
in
the
development
of
the
necessary
project
naturally
the
above
remark
do
not
in
any
sense
refer
to
change
definitely
approve
in
which
additional
or
different
production
facility
be
essential
for
their
proper
execution
as
it
turn
out
i
be
not
of
course
pessimistic
enough
indeed
it
would
soon
be
a
question
whether
we
be
able
to
cope
with
the
unbelievable
course
of
event
although
the
depression
do
not
occur
all
at
once
the
downward
step
be
gigantic
general
motor
sale
of
billion
in
fell
about
one
third
to
million
in
after
the
close
of
i
say
in
the
annual
report
which
i
use
to
write
myself
the
follow
the
economic
situation
of
practically
all
important
consume
country
of
the
world
during
the
year
be
materially
out
of
adjustment
involve
as
the
corporation
be
in
an
important
way
in
the
business
activity
of
nearly
every
country
in
the
world
its
operation
be
adversely
affected
by
such
a
situation
there
arose
as
a
result
unusual
problem
of
administration
and
policy
which
have
to
be
dealt
with
effectively
and
aggressively
if
the
interest
of
the
stockholder
be
to
be
protect
the
future
position
of
the
institution
not
only
from
the
standpoint
of
the
confidence
with
which
it
be
regard
by
the
public
which
be
a
measure
of
its
goodwill
but
likewise
from
the
standpoint
of
its
future
economic
development
call
for
the
most
search
analysis
of
all
problem
the
analysis
begin
as
a
matter
of
atmosphere
it
may
be
of
some
interest
to
indicate
how
the
management
of
a
corporation
like
general
motor
talk
to
itself
when
confront
by
catastrophic
event
on
january
i
address
the
follow
letter
to
the
member
of
the
operation
committee
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
be
absent
from
the
operation
committee
meeting
on
thursday
and
to
remind
those
who
attend
the
meeting
i
want
to
say
that
one
of
the
principal
point
of
business
at
the
next
meeting
will
be
a
contribution
from
each
member
as
to
what
in
his
opinion
have
constitute
weakness
in
procedure
policy
or
thought
in
the
year
just
close
that
should
be
eliminate
and
what
new
point
can
be
developed
that
will
be
helpful
in
the
year
the
close
of
one
year
and
the
advent
of
a
new
form
a
psychological
and
practical
opportunity
of
deal
with
a
matter
of
this
kind
naturally
we
must
deal
with
broad
principle
of
policy
and
type
of
think
more
than
detailed
problem
of
administration
to
illustrate
what
i
have
in
mind
i
will
give
the
follow
thought
from
some
note
which
i
have
already
make
on
the
subject
first
i
think
we
have
lack
and
perhaps
still
lack
courage
in
deal
with
weakness
in
personnel
we
know
weakness
exist
we
tolerate
them
and
finally
after
tolerate
them
an
abnormal
length
of
time
we
make
the
change
and
then
regret
that
we
have
not
act
before
second
i
think
notwithstanding
that
we
have
the
reputation
of
a
fact
find
organization
that
we
do
not
get
the
fact
even
now
as
completely
as
we
should
we
sit
around
and
discus
thing
without
the
fact
i
think
we
should
break
ourselves
of
that
and
not
permit
any
member
of
the
committee
to
have
an
important
problem
determine
upon
without
all
member
of
the
committee
have
the
fact
before
them
and
be
place
in
a
position
to
exercise
their
own
individual
judgment
otherwise
the
committee
be
not
fair
to
itself
and
to
the
corporation
because
it
be
not
discharge
its
full
responsibility
to
same
third
i
think
that
we
become
too
superficial
and
that
we
should
correct
this
tendency
problem
be
crowd
in
on
us
time
be
limited
the
meeting
be
some
time
long
and
we
naturally
get
tire
these
circumstance
and
many
others
lead
us
to
make
mistake
without
adequate
consideration
and
mistake
be
bound
to
occur
it
be
easy
not
to
do
it
at
all
than
to
do
it
haphazardly
or
without
due
consideration
and
even
if
we
lose
an
opportunity
it
will
come
up
again
sooner
or
later
and
in
the
long
run
we
will
gain
by
more
thoroughly
deal
with
our
problem
the
above
be
just
some
thought
that
occur
to
me
in
order
to
give
you
the
type
of
matter
that
i
would
appreciate
your
think
over
each
member
of
the
committee
will
be
expect
to
make
a
real
contribution
a
pretty
mild
statement
in
the
circumstance
but
every
business
profession
and
group
of
people
have
its
own
way
and
often
its
own
jargon
the
top
management
understood
that
the
above
letter
be
a
call
to
them
to
think
everything
over
for
six
month
a
deluge
of
memoranda
come
over
my
desk
deal
with
the
broad
kind
of
question
and
there
be
a
divergence
of
opinion
mr
pratt
mr
mooney
and
mr
knudsen
felt
we
have
become
over
centralize
mr
pratt
write
on
january
as
follow
in
my
judgment
the
great
weakness
in
the
procedure
and
policy
of
general
motor
corporation
be
the
tendency
of
the
operation
committee
to
originate
and
discus
detailed
problem
of
the
division
instead
of
insist
that
the
division
initiate
their
respective
policy
and
problem
and
refer
their
solution
to
the
operation
committee
for
check
and
approval
consciously
or
unconsciously
the
way
in
which
we
have
operate
general
motor
in
the
past
year
there
have
be
an
alarm
tendency
towards
centralization
of
all
initiative
and
action
in
the
operation
committee
i
think
the
reverse
be
necessary
the
initiative
must
be
in
the
division
and
our
job
be
to
see
that
we
have
general
manager
who
will
take
the
initiative
rather
than
attempt
to
supply
all
of
the
initiative
from
the
central
organization
i
would
also
like
to
suggest
where
weakness
be
thought
to
be
that
they
be
place
on
the
table
and
frankly
discuss
regardless
of
personality
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
under
the
impact
of
severe
contraction
some
over
centralization
take
place
and
it
be
wrong
on
the
other
side
however
messrs
wilson
grant
hunt
and
bradley
all
staff
men
thought
the
contrary
each
of
them
recommend
some
specific
form
of
increase
coordination
mr
wilson
want
to
bring
all
the
division
up
to
the
standard
of
the
most
progressive
division
in
manufacturing
organization
equipment
and
processing
method
mr
grant
make
a
similar
proposition
for
sale
and
general
management
but
he
confess
he
be
unsure
how
to
do
it
in
a
way
consistent
with
decentralization
for
the
time
be
at
least
he
say
i
know
only
one
answer
to
this
problem
and
it
be
to
have
lot
of
will
power
patience
and
sell
ability
in
make
our
divisional
contact
mr
hunt
with
the
concreteness
of
the
engineer
propose
to
extend
the
interchangeable
body
program
as
far
as
possible
through
the
car
line
and
to
make
a
new
application
of
engineering
research
to
car
feature
that
have
immediate
possibility
mr
bradley
note
inadequate
preparation
for
discussion
in
the
operation
committee
propose
the
appointment
of
subcommittee
to
expedite
the
routine
work
of
the
top
committee
the
truth
be
i
believe
that
both
side
be
right
the
horn
of
the
old
dilemma
have
reappear
we
have
to
have
more
coordination
to
meet
the
new
condition
and
at
the
same
time
we
have
to
keep
the
top
management
from
fall
into
the
hopeless
position
of
try
to
administer
the
affair
of
the
decentralize
division
on
june
i
take
the
first
step
toward
a
new
setup
with
the
appointment
of
a
number
of
advisory
group
i
state
this
proposal
as
follow
that
advisory
group
be
form
as
advisory
to
the
group
executive
for
the
purpose
of
establish
the
broad
possible
foundation
of
fact
and
opinion
in
order
that
the
recommendation
submit
to
the
operation
committee
and
the
decision
of
operating
policy
even
when
not
submit
to
the
committee
be
as
constructive
as
the
best
thought
in
the
corporation
permit
the
significance
of
this
proposal
lay
in
its
effort
to
achieve
broader
more
active
and
more
regularize
contact
between
the
general
officer
the
staff
and
the
division
without
give
the
staff
any
authority
over
the
division
some
men
fear
that
this
move
would
encourage
the
staff
executive
to
give
order
to
the
division
manager
but
that
be
not
a
necessary
consequence
as
i
shall
indicate
presently
the
advisory
group
be
adopt
in
but
by
the
end
of
that
year
far
discussion
of
broad
problem
of
organization
give
way
to
drastic
emergency
measure
aim
at
sheer
survival
as
the
nation
and
the
world
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
great
depression
the
automobile
industry
in
the
united
state
and
canada
drop
from
a
production
of
about
million
car
and
truck
worth
about
billion
at
retail
in
to
about
million
unit
worth
about
billion
in
that
be
low
than
any
year
since
the
war
year
thanks
to
the
financial
and
operating
control
the
development
of
which
i
have
described
in
earlier
chapter
general
motor
do
not
approach
disaster
as
it
have
in
the
slump
we
make
an
orderly
step
by
step
retreat
in
all
matter
include
wage
and
salary
reduction
sale
by
our
united
state
and
canadian
plant
drop
to
car
and
truck
in
as
compare
with
about
million
in
a
tremendous
drop
percent
when
you
consider
the
many
expense
that
be
fix
that
we
fare
relatively
well
than
the
industry
be
show
by
the
fact
that
our
share
of
the
market
increase
from
percent
in
to
percent
in
the
trough
year
of
the
depression
our
profit
drop
from
about
million
in
to
in
still
in
the
black
thanks
mainly
to
our
financial
control
procedure
in
we
be
operating
at
less
than
percent
of
capacity
to
economize
we
coordinate
to
a
great
extent
our
work
in
purchasing
design
production
and
sell
and
some
of
these
change
be
of
last
value
in
purchasing
and
production
for
example
we
achieve
a
finer
classification
of
part
and
increase
interchangeability
of
part
among
the
division
the
most
important
single
interchangeability
be
in
a
reduction
of
body
to
three
basic
standard
type
the
most
difficult
economy
to
get
be
in
commercial
or
sell
expense
and
here
we
take
the
most
drastic
measure
of
reorganization
in
march
the
operation
committee
after
a
three
day
session
adopt
a
radical
revision
of
the
product
policy
of
the
decision
be
take
to
consolidate
the
manufacturing
of
chevrolet
and
pontiac
both
thereby
come
under
mr
knudsen
s
jurisdiction
a
similar
consolidation
be
order
between
buick
and
oldsmobile
on
the
sale
end
the
activity
of
buick
oldsmobile
and
pontiac
be
consolidated
in
a
single
new
sale
company
b
o
p
and
dealer
be
give
more
than
one
car
to
sell
in
effect
from
a
management
point
of
view
general
motor
for
a
year
and
a
half
be
reduce
from
five
to
three
car
division
the
severity
of
the
contraction
and
the
pressure
of
event
attend
it
in
and
around
the
corporation
cause
me
to
reflect
on
whether
our
scheme
of
management
could
respond
properly
to
such
an
era
be
we
set
up
to
contract
and
expand
at
will
to
coordinate
and
still
keep
clear
the
distinction
between
policy
and
administration
if
we
restore
the
traditional
five
car
division
how
would
we
relate
the
car
in
the
new
situation
inevitably
when
an
industrial
enterprise
be
shaken
with
such
a
force
as
we
met
at
the
onset
of
the
great
depression
there
have
to
be
confusion
in
november
i
begin
to
write
again
on
the
subject
of
new
policy
begin
at
the
begin
on
the
subject
of
policy
itself
i
say
i
feel
that
this
phase
of
the
general
organization
problem
be
of
particular
importance
to
general
motor
not
because
of
its
size
particularly
but
on
account
of
the
nature
of
its
business
subject
as
it
be
to
what
i
might
term
rapid
change
in
other
word
i
contend
a
unit
of
the
automotive
industry
have
far
less
coast
ability
i
might
term
it
than
unit
in
most
any
other
industry
that
might
be
select
for
comparison
as
i
analyze
our
picture
look
forward
into
the
future
our
success
or
let
me
say
the
maintenance
of
our
position
absolutely
depends
upon
the
ability
of
our
organization
to
lay
down
a
strategy
as
will
enable
us
to
forecast
the
rapid
change
that
be
take
place
and
will
continue
to
take
place
in
the
various
activity
in
which
we
be
interested
involve
all
the
functional
division
within
such
activity
and
to
provide
for
those
change
with
sufficient
rapidity
in
make
this
statement
i
be
not
minimize
in
any
sense
the
importance
of
effectively
and
economically
carry
out
such
policy
as
may
be
adopt
i
be
simply
try
to
emphasize
the
point
that
the
policy
phase
be
of
vital
concern
because
unless
we
can
with
reasonable
intelligence
meet
this
issue
no
matter
how
able
an
administrative
set
up
we
may
have
it
be
limited
in
its
opportunity
to
function
i
might
add
far
that
look
forward
i
feel
that
we
have
get
to
more
aggressively
deal
with
that
phase
of
our
problem
than
we
have
in
the
past
it
be
go
to
be
harder
to
maintain
both
our
competitive
position
and
our
profit
position
we
can
not
afford
to
take
the
time
in
the
future
that
we
have
in
the
past
to
make
up
our
mind
what
we
should
do
with
respect
to
change
in
trend
which
be
have
an
influence
on
our
position
my
main
purpose
in
the
memorandum
from
which
the
above
passage
be
take
be
to
reassert
the
purely
policy
make
role
of
the
executive
committee
i
also
say
that
the
committee
should
be
in
a
position
to
deal
frankly
and
aggressively
with
any
division
or
the
relationship
of
one
division
with
another
to
do
this
best
i
thought
the
committee
should
contain
only
general
executive
not
divisional
executive
how
then
would
the
policy
make
executive
get
and
use
their
information
i
write
we
must
develop
way
and
mean
to
keep
the
member
of
the
executive
committee
in
contact
with
the
problem
so
that
they
can
exercise
not
only
intelligent
judgment
on
the
question
but
intelligent
independent
judgment
of
course
the
executive
committee
have
always
be
legally
and
in
fact
the
top
operating
committee
but
because
it
met
jointly
with
the
operation
committee
and
because
decision
be
make
with
the
participation
of
both
policy
and
operating
people
the
line
between
policy
and
administration
be
not
sharply
enough
drawn
the
first
thing
be
to
limit
the
executive
committee
to
policy
decision
make
independently
of
the
administrative
operating
people
it
be
particularly
important
that
independent
policy
make
be
re
establish
because
of
the
new
condition
in
the
car
market
and
the
management
problem
that
would
arise
if
we
restore
the
traditional
five
division
a
move
which
i
propose
the
situation
be
this
in
the
automobile
market
of
the
low
price
group
grow
relatively
to
encompass
percent
of
the
industry
s
unit
car
sale
as
compare
with
percent
in
this
meant
for
the
old
car
line
that
we
would
have
four
line
in
percent
of
the
market
and
one
line
in
percent
of
the
market
mr
brown
for
reason
of
economy
prefer
three
division
i
prefer
five
despite
the
extra
cost
which
i
thought
we
could
recover
through
increase
volume
i
state
and
in
part
restate
my
longstanding
view
on
commercial
policy
in
a
report
to
the
finance
committee
on
january
and
since
they
become
the
corporation
s
policy
i
quote
them
here
the
fundamental
conception
of
general
motor
car
product
program
certain
member
of
the
committee
may
recall
that
at
the
time
mr
p
s
du
pont
become
president
of
the
corporation
one
of
his
first
act
be
to
appoint
a
group
to
study
the
very
important
problem
of
car
product
up
to
that
time
there
have
be
no
fundamental
conception
or
plan
there
be
no
definite
relationship
between
the
product
of
one
car
division
and
another
or
in
other
word
no
coordination
it
be
generally
recognize
that
there
should
be
a
definite
relationship
and
a
certain
amount
of
coordination
and
the
purpose
of
the
study
be
to
establish
what
that
should
be
this
study
be
authorize
by
a
resolution
of
the
then
executive
committee
under
date
of
april
now
approach
thirteen
year
ago
the
study
refer
to
here
be
that
concern
product
policy
discuss
earlier
i
take
note
of
the
general
evolution
of
the
automobile
in
those
thirteen
year
under
the
pressure
of
intensified
competition
and
observe
that
the
value
of
a
car
have
come
to
be
center
around
certain
consideration
appearance
or
style
technical
quality
price
and
reputation
it
be
my
impression
at
that
time
that
difference
in
these
matter
be
narrower
than
they
have
be
in
earlier
year
and
that
because
the
state
of
the
art
be
available
to
all
automobile
technology
would
not
in
the
future
result
in
effective
difference
from
a
sell
point
of
view
i
be
mistaken
about
that
although
my
general
point
i
believe
be
valid
namely
that
sell
have
begin
to
focus
on
personal
preference
of
the
consumer
especially
in
matter
of
style
i
say
people
like
different
thing
many
people
do
not
want
to
have
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
neighborhood
have
the
design
of
any
car
be
an
artistic
and
engineering
compromise
no
car
can
embrace
all
the
desirable
feature
relatively
inconsequential
feature
will
often
influence
a
sale
adversely
to
the
customer
s
interest
with
respect
to
other
far
more
consequential
feature
no
prospect
be
intelligent
enough
to
definitely
determine
the
weight
value
of
all
the
element
that
enter
into
any
particular
car
the
consumer
be
also
greatly
influence
by
the
personal
relationship
with
the
dealer
and
sometimes
rightly
other
time
wrongly
becomes
antagonistic
to
one
particular
dealer
general
motor
in
sell
of
all
the
unit
in
the
industry
which
be
practically
one
out
of
every
two
assumes
a
tremendous
responsibility
with
respect
to
all
these
question
under
those
circumstance
new
customer
be
hard
to
get
and
an
old
customer
lose
be
hard
to
replace
it
be
quite
different
sell
than
in
sell
it
be
perfectly
possible
from
the
engineering
and
manufacturing
standpoint
to
make
two
car
at
not
a
great
difference
in
price
and
weight
but
considerably
different
in
appearance
and
to
some
extent
different
in
technical
feature
both
in
degree
built
with
the
same
fundamental
tool
equipment
in
view
of
the
concentration
of
volume
within
a
narrow
price
range
be
it
desirable
for
the
corporation
to
place
all
its
egg
in
one
basket
in
view
of
the
above
and
many
other
consideration
or
be
it
well
to
capitalize
the
recognize
fact
that
different
thing
appeal
to
different
people
that
not
all
the
sound
engineering
idea
can
be
incorporate
in
one
unit
that
the
influence
of
the
dealer
be
an
important
consideration
i
answer
these
question
with
a
statement
of
my
commercial
policy
as
follow
i
believe
that
in
the
low
price
field
where
from
to
plus
of
the
volume
be
concentrate
we
should
have
more
than
one
appeal
and
that
our
representation
whatever
it
may
be
should
contemplate
the
incorporation
of
sufficient
difference
in
essential
element
of
design
as
to
make
the
broad
possible
appeal
to
the
large
number
of
people
i
accept
as
a
corollary
of
this
principle
the
fact
that
manufacture
and
distribution
be
complicate
i
regret
that
we
can
not
make
one
thing
that
everybody
will
buy
but
i
do
not
think
under
present
circumstance
that
be
possible
in
community
of
high
potential
where
there
must
necessarily
be
many
dealer
compete
against
each
other
with
the
same
product
in
the
same
market
i
believe
that
it
be
well
policy
to
limit
the
number
of
dealer
compete
for
one
line
and
obtain
the
increase
number
of
contact
through
a
different
appeal
than
it
be
to
go
the
other
route
to
illustrate
let
us
take
a
community
in
which
we
might
maintain
x
dealer
rather
than
have
those
x
dealer
compete
with
each
other
on
the
basis
of
exactly
the
same
merchandise
which
be
very
demoralize
competition
i
believe
it
be
well
to
have
a
part
of
same
and
a
major
part
of
course
compete
against
each
other
with
the
chevrolet
line
and
additional
dealer
compete
with
line
diversified
from
chevrolet
for
all
the
above
reason
i
personally
feel
that
the
policy
as
outline
many
year
ago
by
the
executive
committee
should
be
modify
substantially
as
follow
that
give
recognition
to
the
concentration
of
volume
in
the
low
price
field
it
shall
be
the
policy
of
the
corporation
to
increase
its
representation
within
that
field
but
in
do
so
the
utmost
consideration
must
be
give
to
the
importance
of
the
great
possible
diversity
in
all
element
of
consumer
appeal
in
such
additional
offering
so
as
to
build
the
strong
foundation
of
acceptability
to
the
consumer
this
proposal
to
maintain
diversity
in
car
and
separate
divisional
sell
effort
in
a
crowd
price
class
require
new
form
of
coordination
and
the
more
you
coordinate
the
more
question
you
draw
up
into
the
policy
area
and
therefore
the
finer
must
be
the
distinction
between
policy
and
administration
for
example
when
two
or
more
division
use
common
component
the
independence
of
each
division
be
limited
to
the
extent
that
there
must
be
a
common
program
between
them
someone
therefore
must
coordinate
such
a
program
as
this
process
be
elaborate
more
question
come
into
the
policy
area
which
be
formerly
in
the
administrative
area
i
have
always
believe
it
be
imperative
to
maintain
the
distinction
between
policy
and
administration
without
that
distinction
a
decentralize
organization
would
be
in
constant
confusion
as
to
what
be
decentralize
and
what
be
not
so
the
big
question
be
the
policy
one
and
it
demand
a
general
solution
the
solution
we
work
out
at
that
time
remains
today
the
basic
decision
make
process
in
general
motor
it
be
contain
in
the
follow
recommendation
which
i
make
to
the
executive
committee
in
october
it
have
already
be
developed
that
the
creation
of
a
policy
might
emanate
either
from
the
central
authority
or
from
within
the
operating
division
or
subsidiary
the
finalization
or
authorization
of
a
policy
be
exclusively
within
the
province
of
the
central
authority
as
present
by
a
govern
committee
from
whatever
source
the
policy
may
originate
it
be
essential
that
those
involve
in
authorization
should
be
qualify
to
pas
on
the
proposal
with
a
full
knowledge
of
its
implication
as
affect
the
present
and
future
position
of
the
business
where
a
policy
involves
important
consequence
as
in
the
case
of
the
operation
of
general
motor
corporation
it
be
essential
that
the
broad
possible
foundation
of
thought
and
fact
and
the
approach
of
the
proposal
from
as
many
different
angle
as
possible
be
establish
to
the
degree
that
authorization
becomes
superficial
to
that
degree
do
the
position
of
the
business
become
jeopardized
or
its
progress
adversely
affected
the
above
more
or
less
philosophical
discussion
be
for
the
purpose
of
establish
the
reason
for
and
the
desirability
of
formulate
a
broader
conception
of
the
policy
creation
phase
of
administration
than
have
heretofore
exist
in
the
general
motor
scheme
of
thing
this
procedure
establishes
for
the
first
time
the
follow
principle
that
the
development
or
creation
of
constructive
and
advanced
policy
as
define
be
of
vital
influence
in
the
progress
and
stability
of
the
business
that
in
the
organization
of
general
motor
corporation
the
fact
just
recite
should
be
recognize
through
a
specialization
of
policy
creation
independent
of
policy
execution
so
far
as
that
be
reasonably
practical
the
concept
of
policy
creation
described
above
be
embody
in
a
set
of
new
organ
in
general
motor
call
policy
group
these
group
generally
speak
have
functional
title
such
as
engineering
policy
group
distribution
policy
group
and
the
like
with
later
some
line
group
such
as
the
overseas
policy
group
they
combine
the
top
executive
officer
include
the
president
with
functional
staff
men
and
each
group
be
charge
with
make
policy
recommendation
in
its
functional
area
to
the
top
operating
policy
committee
of
the
corporation
the
divisional
manager
be
charge
with
administration
be
specifically
exclude
from
these
group
the
group
themselves
as
group
be
not
give
authority
over
the
division
or
any
authority
to
finalize
policy
but
since
the
group
contain
the
principal
officer
of
the
corporation
policy
group
recommendation
be
normally
adopt
by
the
govern
committee
in
the
area
of
operation
we
try
out
policy
group
in
the
engineering
and
distribution
area
between
and
and
in
the
latter
year
expand
their
use
to
other
function
and
some
operation
and
adopt
them
officially
for
the
corporation
they
express
in
more
sophisticated
form
the
management
policy
i
first
formulate
in
the
organization
study
of
that
be
of
decentralize
operation
with
coordinate
control
general
motor
corporation
organization
chart
for
and
be
at
the
end
of
this
chapter
there
be
now
nine
policy
group
in
the
corporation
divide
into
two
category
first
there
be
those
that
deal
with
function
namely
engineering
distribution
research
personnel
and
public
relation
all
largely
related
though
not
exclusively
to
the
car
operation
and
then
there
be
those
that
deal
with
certain
group
operation
namely
overseas
canadian
general
engine
and
household
appliance
in
the
case
of
each
functional
activity
these
policy
group
work
under
the
auspex
of
the
section
of
the
general
staff
to
which
they
be
related
the
engineering
policy
group
for
example
be
related
to
the
engineering
staff
through
the
engineering
staff
vice
president
in
the
case
of
operation
each
group
be
under
the
auspex
of
the
group
executive
for
that
set
of
operation
member
of
these
various
group
carry
great
influence
at
the
high
level
in
the
corporation
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
chief
executive
officer
for
example
be
a
member
of
all
but
three
of
the
policy
group
and
the
president
a
member
of
all
but
two
in
the
case
of
the
distribution
engineering
research
personnel
and
public
relation
policy
group
the
member
of
the
executive
committee
as
well
as
others
of
the
operating
management
be
member
their
full
membership
comprises
a
cross
section
of
the
whole
of
the
corporation
s
executive
talent
hence
their
great
weight
in
unite
staff
and
line
operation
prepare
policy
recommendation
and
develop
the
basis
for
executive
decision
the
activity
of
the
policy
group
varies
with
the
change
need
for
policy
determination
the
engineering
policy
group
for
example
meet
regularly
to
work
on
new
product
program
in
this
activity
the
general
manager
individually
and
collectively
in
person
and
through
their
functional
department
be
in
intimate
contact
with
the
work
of
the
policy
group
they
be
not
member
of
the
policy
group
as
i
have
say
because
those
group
be
charge
with
policy
development
and
the
general
manager
be
charge
with
administration
the
engineering
policy
croup
consists
of
the
chairman
of
the
group
who
be
vice
president
for
engineering
the
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the

the
president
of
the

the

vice

the

vice

for
financial
affair
the
executive
vice
president
for
the
automotive
and
part
division
the
executive
vice
president
for
the
other
operating
division
the
vice
president
for
style
distribution
research
and
manufacturing
and
the
vice
president
who
be
group
executive
for
the
car
and
truck
group
the
body
and
assembly
division
group
the
accessory

and
the
dayton
household
appliance
and
engine
group
of
the
fifteen
member
of
the
engineering
policy
group
eight
be
member
of
the
executive
committee
and
constitute
that
entire
committee
and
four
be
also
member
of
the
finance
committee
the
function
of
the
engineering
policy
group
in
the
development
of
a
new
model
in
general
motor
be
a
good
example
of
the
work
of
a
policy
group
the
initiation
of
a
product
program
in
any
division
lie
within
the
responsibility
of
the
general
manager
of
that
division
in
collaboration
with
its
engineering
department
influence
of
course
by
the
market
as
reflect
by
its
sale
department
and
importantly
coordinate
with
the
need
of
the
other
operating
division
if
we
be
to
go
back
twenty
five
or
thirty
year
we
would
find
little
coordination
between
a
program
propose
by
one
division
and
one
that
might
be
put
forward
by
any
of
the
other
car
division
but
over
the
course
of
time
a
very
great
amount
of
coordination
have
become
necessary
in
other
word
a
divisional
product
program
instead
of
be
integral
in
itself
be
deeply
involve
with
the
product
program
of
many
of
the
other
division
therefore
it
must
be
developed
from
the
corporate
point
of
view
the
time
between
the
conception
of
any
new
program
and
its
final
execution
be
presently
about
two
year
in
the
case
of
an
advanced
engineering
concept
it
be
very
likely
to
be
more
than
two
year
and
during
that
time
it
be
subject
to
an
untold
amount
of
change
therefore
during
the
development
period
detailed
contact
must
be
continually
maintain
between
the
engineering
department
of
all
the
car
division
the
style
staff
the
fisher
body
division
and
more
or
less
the
accessory
division
because
they
be
all
commonly
concerned
with
and
work
together
on
a
single
problem
here
the
corporation
s
engineering
staff
come
into
the
picture
and
collaborates
with
the
other
division
in
order
to
effect
the
necessary
coordination
the
coordination
agency
if
i
may
call
it
such
that
pass
on
the
problem
involve
in
this
process
be
the
engineering
policy
group
its
decision
be
normally
adopt
by
the
executive
committee
whose
member
be
present
through
the
whole
process
it
be
the
depression
and
the
economy
it
force
in
coordination
of
the
product
as
i
have
show
that
lead
to
this
new
type
of
coordination
in
management
with
the
establishment
of
policy
group
in
the
scheme
of
management
which
originate
in
the
organization
study
of
be
complete
long
reflection
on
the
distinction
to
be
make
between
policy
and
administration
lead
me
in
also
to
consider
the
application
of
this
concept
more
precisely
to
the
organization
of
the
govern
committee
of
the
corporation
early
that
year
i
propose
that
in
place
of
the
finance
and
executive
committee
we
should
have
a
single
policy
committee
to
concentrate
on
make
overall
policy
for
the
corporation
and
an
administration
committee
to
concentrate
on
the
carry
out
of
policy
after
considerable
discussion
we
adopt
this
change
in
may
of
that
year
the
finance
committee
and
the
executive
committee
be
discontinue
a
new
policy
committee
be
form
it
be
compose
of
course
entirely
of
member
of
the
board
and
brought
operating
officer
financial
officer
and
outside
director
into
one
senior
group
the
new
administration
committee
be
compose
entirely
of
operating
officer
the
policy
committee
take
over
all
the
responsibility
of
the
former
finance
committee
and
additional
responsibility
for
operating
policy
from
through
the
policy
committee
make
policy
for
operation
in
a
number
of
important
area
for
example
it
establish
the
broad
outline
of
labor
policy
and
program
and
also
decide
a
number
of
distribution
policy
particularly
those
concern
dealer
relation
as
international
condition
become
increasingly
unsettled
more
and
more
of
its
time
be
give
to
determine
policy
for
the
overseas
subsidiary
as
war
approach
the
policy
committee
have
to
deal
with
increase
shortage
of
raw
material
relation
with
the
government
and
the
impact
on
our
civilian
operation
of
government
request
for
the
production
of
airplane
engine
tank
and
other
military
item
the
entrance
of
the
united
state
into
the
war
in
december
require
a
special
change
in
our
committee
organization
to
make
the
rapid
shift
to
all
out
war
production
we
set
up
on
january
a
war
emergency
committee
compose
of
six
top
executive
mostly
from
the
policy
committee
this
committee
met
once
a
week
and
sometimes
more
often
from
january
through
april
it
ran
general
motor
temporarily
the
policy
and
administration
committee
do
little
more
than
ratify
the
war
emergency
committee
s
work
but
in
may
as
we
settle
into
war
production
we
abolish
the
war
emergency
committee
we
then
transform
the
administration
committee
consist
of
all
the
general
executive
and
group
vice
president
into
the
war
administration
committee
for
the
next
two
to
three
year
the
war
administration
committee
practically
ran
the
organization
this
be
because
our
wartime
policy
be
set
and
nearly
all
the
corporation
s
work
be
war
production
aside
from
the
technical
problem
of
production
our
policy
decision
be
concerned
primarily
with
our
relationship
with
various
government
department
by
the
policy
committee
once
more
have
come
into
its
own
as
we
be
develop
our
broad
postwar
planning
since
the
problem
of
reconversion
and
postwar
business
be
so
enormously
important
nearly
all
major
question
even
some
concerned
with
the
run
of
the
business
come
to
the
policy
committee
as
a
result
of
this
overburden
of
the
policy
committee
we
begin
to
reconsider
the
structure
and
function
of
the
committee
of
the
board
a
single
policy
committee
be
an
ideal
solution
to
the
problem
of
separate
policy
from
administration
but
two
factor
promise
to
make
it
impractical
in
the
new
circumstance
that
be
develop
first
it
be
apparent
that
the
growth
in
the
volume
and
complexity
of
the
corporation
s
activity
would
require
a
greatly
enlarge
responsibility
both
in
finance
and
operation
at
the
board
level
second
it
be
go
to
be
difficult
to
obtain
the
service
of
experienced
outside
director
with
adequate
time
to
serve
on
a
committee
deal
with
operation
as
well
as
financial
policy
therefore
in
we
dissolve
the
policy
committee
and
replace
it
with
the
two
traditional
committee
represent
the
primary
function
of
finance
and
operation
now
rename
the
financial
policy
committee
and
the
operation
policy
committee
in
we
restore
their
old
name
finance
committee
and
executive
committee
and
in
a
far
refinement
expand
their
membership
to
obtain
more
overlap
of
the
individual
on
the
two
committee
so
much
for
the
evolution
of
the
form
of
policy
make
in
general
motor
i
want
to
say
something
now
on
my
philosophy
of
the
role
of
the
board
of
director
the
supreme
body
of
the
corporation
the
board
of
course
function
as
board
of
large
corporation
usually
do
in
good
part
through
its
committee
there
be
four
such
committee
in
general
motor
each
of
which
be
compose
exclusively
of
director
authorize
to
exercise
the
power
of
the
board
in
the
management
of
the
business
and
affair
of
the
corporation
these
be
the
finance
executive
bonus
and
salary
and
audit
committee
i
shall
comment
here
only
on
the
two
that
be
the
central
authority
for
policy
determination
the
finance
committee
and
the
executive
committee
the
majority
of
the
member
of
the
finance
committee
be
outside
director
that
be
director
who
be
not
active
in
the
management
of
the
business
they
include
former
operation
officer
like
myself
and
director
who
have
never
be
associate
with
the
corporation
except
on
its
board
all
of
the
member
of
the
executive
committee
be
director
who
be
active
in
management
both
committee
deal
with
problem
of
policy
as
distinct
from
administration
the
action
of
both
committee
be
subject
to
revision
by
the
board
the
central
responsibility
of
the
finance
committee
be
the
corporation
s
purse
this
committee
have
authority
under
the
by
law
to
determine
the
financial
policy
of
the
corporation
and
direct
its
financial
affair
it
have
authority
over
all
capital
appropriation
and
over
entrance
into
any
new
line
of
business
it
review
and
approves
pricing
policy
and
procedure
as
formulate
by
the
executive
committee
it
have
the
responsibility
to
see
that
the
corporation
have
adequate
capital
for
its
need
and
that
it
earns
a
satisfactory
return
on
its
investment
and
this
committee
make
the
dividend
recommendation
to
the
board
the
executive
committee
be
responsible
for
operating
policy
i
have
described
earlier
how
policy
have
be
developed
in
the
policy
group
whose
function
be
to
channel
the
work
of
the
operating
staff
and
other
authority
in
the
corporation
however
the
actual
adoption
of
operating
policy
be
the
responsibility
of
the
executive
committee
appropriation
request
for
capital
expenditure
be
prepared
under
the
supervision
of
this
committee
for
submission
to
the
finance
committee
in
practice
the
finance
committee
have
delegate
to
the
executive
committee
the
authority
to
approve
capital
expenditure
up
to
million
the
general
motor
board
as
a
whole
meet
regularly
once
a
month
and
at
time
on
special
occasion
from
time
to
time
it
elect
from
its
member
those
who
be
to
serve
on
the
committee
i
have
described
it
also
elect
those
who
be
to
administer
the
business
that
be
the
officer
of
the
corporation
and
act
on
legal
and
general
corporate
matter
require
board
action
such
as
the
declaration
of
dividend
or
the
issuance
of
additional
security
furthermore
to
my
way
of
think
base
on
my
experience
the
general
motor
board
of
director
have
still
another
and
i
believe
unique
function
of
great
significance
that
be
what
i
call
an
audit
function
i
do
not
mean
audit
in
the
usual
financial
sense
but
one
that
contemplates
a
continuous
review
and
appraisal
of
what
be
go
on
throughout
the
enterprise
general
motor
be
of
course
both
large
and
highly
technical
in
all
its
ramification
it
be
therefore
impossible
to
conceive
of
every
member
of
the
corporation
s
board
of
director
have
intimate
knowledge
of
and
business
experience
in
every
one
of
the
technical
matter
which
require
top
level
consideration
or
action
also
those
of
its
member
with
outside
responsibility
would
not
have
the
time
to
examine
and
decide
upon
all
such
matter
the
problem
be
too
many
too
diversified
and
too
complex
nevertheless
although
the
board
may
not
be
equip
to
deal
with
technical
operating
problem
it
can
and
should
be
responsible
for
the
end
result
the
general
motor
board
deal
with
the
corporation
s
affair
before
the
fact
through
projection
of
what
we
hope
to
accomplish
and
after
the
fact
through
evaluation
of
report
and
other
data
and
it
be
prepared
to
take
proper
action
where
need
for
this
purpose
the
general
motor
board
receives
a
comprehensive
picture
of
the
enterprise
and
its
operation
report
from
its
executive
and
finance
committee
be
present
monthly
and
those
from
other
stand
committee
periodically
cover
their
action
a
visual
presentation
on
a
screen
set
forth
for
examination
every
material
aspect
of
the
corporation
s
position
financial
statistical
and
competitive
and
a
forecast
of
the
immediate

this
be
support
by
explanatory
comment
and
also
by
a
summary
of
the

in

board
member
then
ask
question
and
seek
explanation
this
audit
function
as
the
general
motor
board
exercise
it
be
of
the
high
value
to
the
enterprise
and
its
shareholder
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
board
of
director
be
well
inform
and
thus
able
to
act
intelligently
on
all
the
change
fact
and
circumstance
than
be
the
board
of
general
motor
chapter
financial
growth
general
motor
be
a
growth
company
and
the
sum
of
all
i
have
say
be
express
in
this
fact
for
most
of
the
early
period
of
general
motor
existence
it
do
not
grow
as
fast
as
the
automobile
industry
as
a
whole
but
after
and
more
particularly
because
of
the
measure
take
by
the
modern
administration
the
corporation
grow
faster
than
the
industry
and
become
its
number
one
producer
we
like
to
believe
that
we
have
make
a
contribution
as
an
industrial
leader
employee
shareholder
dealer
consumer
supplier
and
the
government
to
a
large
degree
have
share
in
the
success
of
general
motor
although
progress
have
be
achieve
for
all
of
these
interest
the
story
of
financial
growth
in
this
chapter
reflect
mainly
the
point
of
view
of
the
shareholder
how
have
the
corporation
serve
its
owner
i
believe
this
can
best
be
see
by
look
at
the
financial
record
of
the
business
how
the
fund
be
supply
or
secure
and
how
they
be
use
from
the
begin
to
the
present
our
shareholder
have
derive
a
substantial
monetary
benefit
from
the
success
of
the
business
through
the
distribution
of
about
two
third
of
the
income
realize
since
inception
a
proportion
which
be
large
than
that
distribute
by
most
business
in
order
to
secure
these
benefit
the
shareholder
have
underwritten
the
growth
of
the
enterprise
by
their
willingness
to
reinvest
the
substantial
sum
require
to
meet
the
need
of
the
business
as
it
grow
of
necessity
during
period
of
expansion
of
facility
and
of
peak
work
capital
need
this
have
meant
that
dividend
have
be
something
less
than
average
the
shareholder
thus
assume
the
risk
of
building
for
the
future
with
no
certainty
of
a
return
and
in
the
early
period
the
return
be
slow
in
come
the
financial
community
in
general
at
that
time
be
bearish
on
the
automobile
industry
and
its
prospect
include
general
motor
many
company
then
in
the
automobile
industry
all
with
a
desire
for
success
be
no
longer
in
existence
with
consequent
loss
of
their
shareholder
investment
thus
it
seem
only
proper
to
measure
the
monetary
return
of
general
motor
shareholder
against
the
risk
they
assume
when
invest
in
an
enterprise
with
an
uncertain
future
broadly
speak
from
the
financial
standpoint
three
period
have
characterize
the
corporation
s
existence
the
first
be
the
long
term
period
of
expansion
from
through
the
second
the
depression
and
world
war
ii
year
from
through
and
the
third
the
post
world
war
ii
year
which
brought
a
renewal
of
expansion
within
these
period
however
there
be
subperiods
of
expansion
contraction
and
stabilization
i
have
related
how
mr
durant
in
the
year
and
create
the
corporation
by
combine
a
number
of
enterprise
most

found
that

we

profitably
invest
under
the
generally
depressed
economic
condition
of
this

the
most
difficult
year
of
course
be
the
three
follow
the
stock
market
crash
i
have
mention
earlier
that
between
and
car
and
truck
production
in
the
united
state
and
canada
fell
percent
from
million
unit
to
only
million
and
that
in
dollar
sale
the
decline
in
the

be
even
more
precipitous
from
billion
at
retail
to
billion
or
percent
and
yet
general
motor
be
able
to
earn
million
in
this
three
year
period
and
to
pay
shareholder
a
total
of
million
million
more

the

earn
despite
the
fact
that
dividend
exceed

net
work
capital
fell
only
million
and
the
corporation
s
holding

cash

short

actually
increase
by
million
or
by
percent
a
case
you
might
say
of
pure
liquidation
what
account
for
this
exceptional
record
in
a
period
in
which
many
durable
good
producer
fail
or
come
close
to
bankruptcy
it
would
be
unfair
to
claim
any
particular
prescience
on
our
part
no
more
than
anyone
else
do
we
see
the
depression
come
i
think
the
story
i
have
told
show
that
we
have
simply
learn
how
to
react
quickly
this
be
perhaps
the
great
payoff
of
our
system
of
financial
and
operating
control
as
a
result
of
the
speed
with
which
we
act
when
sale
begin
to
fall
we
be
able
to
reduce
our
inventory
in
line
with
the
sale
decline
and
to
control
cost
so
that
operation
remain
profitable
our
sale
decline
percent
from
million
in
to
only
million
in
but
our
inventory
be
reduce
percent
or
by
million
with
this
decline
of
more
than
billion
in
sale
net
income
fell
million
but
we
manage
to
earn
in
while
pay
out
million
in
dividend
in
the
early
thirty
as
note
above
we
do
not
feel
the
need
to
spend
very
much
for
new
plant
and
equipment
in
the
five
year
such
expenditure
total
million
in
we
spent
only
million
moreover
during
these
year
we
retire
some
of
our
surplus
plant
and
equipment
in
later
year
as
the
plant
be
need
we
restore
some
of
it
to
the
active
account
by
sale
from
our
united
state
and
canadian
plant
have
recover
to
more
than
million
car
and
truck
about
percent
of
the
peak
and
a
nearly
threefold
increase
in
three
year
the
next
year
our
united
state
and
canadian
car
and
truck
sale
approach
the
mark
and
in
they
set
a
record
of
unit
net
income
however
be
million
in
which
be
not
up
to
the
million
earn
in
or
the
million
in
earnings
in
be
adversely
affected
by
a
six
week
strike
early
in
the
year
and
by
increase
cost
for
example
the
average
straight
time
wage
rate
for
the
corporation
s
u
s
hourly
rate
employee
in
be
percent
high
than
in
and
percent
above
the
rate
but
since
our
investment
need
be
relatively
slight
dividend
payment
total
million
in
the
high
on
record
and
million
in
for
the
two
year
dividend
be
percent
of
net
income
this
rapid
recovery
in
sale
and
output
meant
that
our
production
facility
be
again
under
strain
as
note
above
we
begin
to
reactivate
that
part
of
the
idle
plant
that
have
not
be
make
obsolete
by
product
or
technological
change
and
we
begin
to
need
new
facility
too
as
output
grow
rapidly
during
we
undertook
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
corporation
s
manufacturing
property
at
home
and
abroad
to
ass
our
productive
capacity
in
the
light
of
what
appear
to
be
the
future
sale
possibility
in
the
annual
report
for
i
write
the
rapid
evolution
of
processing
which
be
constantly
go
on
in
the
automotive
industry
due
to
the
yearly
turnover
of
model
produce
a
very
rapid
obsolescence
of
productive
facility
naturally
specific
tool
and
machine
equipment
when
change
be
provide
so
far
as
volume
be
concerned
in
harmony
with
the
sale
outlook
of
the
follow
year
for
these
reason
during
the
year
of
the
depression
the
actual
capacity
of
the
corporation
s
plant
for
the
production
of
current
product
have
be
reduce
in
addition
far
limitation
have
be
place
on
capacity
due
to
the
increase
number
of
model
apparently
necessary
to
provide
the
essential
coverage
of
the
various
market
in
which
the
corporation
be
compete
increase
complication
of
manufacture
incident
to
change
style
and
add
technical
feature
have
also
have
an
important
influence
equally
important
be
the
fact
that
while
the
number
of
hour
work
per
week
by
productive
worker
of
industry
have
be
go
through
a
process
of
reduction
through
evolution
the
depression
period
brought
about
a
far
demand
for
the
reduction
of
weekly
operating
schedule
for
the
worker
with
the
reduction
of
hour
irrespective
of
circumstance
that
might
justify
such
hour
the
impossibility
of
maintain
the
annual
average
of
previous
year
have
tend
to
reduce
the
capacity
of
plant
and
equipment
as
compare
with
previous
year
the
corporation
therefore
in
authorize
expenditure
to
reorganize
readjust
and
expand
the
manufacturing
facility
they
eventually
exceed
million
production
and
sale
continued
to
expand
rapidly
and
so
we
make
another
survey
of
general
motor
operating
facility
in
relation
to
current
and
expect
demand
for
its
product
we
give
consideration
to
three
special
factor
affect
capacity
the
trend
toward
a
shorter
work
week
the
probability
of
a
reduction
in
operating
efficiency
and
the
likelihood
of
some
interruption
of
production
due
to
labor
difficulty
the
latter
two
expectation
prove
correct
for
because
of
these
factor
capacity
of
the
chevrolet
division
be
inadequate
the
division
have
be
unable
to
meet
the
demand
for
its
product
during
each
of
the
precede
three
year
in
both
and
chevrolet
car
and
truck
production
topped
one
million
several
other
division
have
suffer
from
inadequate
capacity
although
to
a
lesser
degree
and
the
development
of
new
product
in
the
general
engine
group
and
household
appliance
group
have
place
these
operation
in
a
position
where
expansion
be
essential
to
exploit
the
new
product
properly
the
capacity
shortage
moreover
be
not
due
to
bottleneck
in
localize
area
the
corporation
s
productive
facility
be
very
well
balance
in
that
respect
but
this
meant
that
any
fundamental
increase
in
capacity
would
require
expenditure
on
a
broad
front
we
authorize
a
program
therefore
call
for
an
expenditure
of
more
than
million
for
new
capacity
in
addition
to
substantial
expenditure
for
modernization
and
replacement
this
expansion
program
be
complete
in
the
economy
turn
sharply
downward
during
the
latter
part
of
and
the
first
half
of

then
reverse
itself
to
move
upward
at
a
rather
rapid
rate

of
automobile
in
the
united
state
generally
follow
this
economic
trend
the
economy
pause
during
the
first
half
of
and
then
swung
upward
in
the
last
half
of
the
year
accelerate
by
the
influence
of
the
outbreak
of
war
in
europe
over
the
decade
of
the
s
as
a
whole
the

spent
million
for

this
be
a
large
capital
expenditure
in
view
of
the
generally
liquidationist
character
of
the

quite
small
in
comparison
with
our

during
the

however
be

grow
at
the
begin
of
the
war
and
well
before
the
profit
renegotiation
law
be
pass
we
adopt
the
policy
of
limit
our
profit
margin
before
tax
on
military
business
to
one
half
of
that
realize
on
civilian
business
in
when
the
condition
of
a
competitive
market
still
prevail
wherever
possible
we
take
war
production
contract
on
a
fix
price
basis
and
we
make
it
a
practice
to
reduce
price
as
we
be
able
to
cut
cost
between
and
therefore
we
earn
a
total
of
million
on
a
sale
volume
of
million
of
these
earnings
we
paid
shareholder
a
total
of
million
in
dividend
our
dividend
payment
which
have
go
to
per
share
of
the
then
outstanding
par
value
common
stock
in
and
be
down
to
per
share
in
and
and
per
share
in
and
although
shareholder
receive
percent
of
net
income
during
the
year
our
liquidity
increase
very
substantially
owe
to
the
fact
that
war
shortage
and
priority
make
it
impossible
to
replace
equipment
on
a
normal
schedule
our
capital
expenditure
of
million
be
less
than
our
provision
for
depreciation
in
these
five
year
between
january
and
december
therefore
we
increase
our
net
work
capital
from
million
to
million
and
our
cash
and
short
term
security
rise
from
million
to
million
in
we
increase
our
capital
expenditure
to
a
record
million
our
net
work
capital
decline
to
million
and
our
cash
and
short
term
security
to
million
the
old
epoch
in
our
financial
history
which
reflect
both
the
business
cycle
and
our
investment
decision
sometimes
separately
more
often
together
come
to
an
end
and
we
move
into
the
great
cycle
of
expansion
which
we
have
know
since
world
war
ii
a
few
thing
should
be
note
before
proceed
the
strategic
question
in
industrial
finance
assume
you
have
something
to
work
with
in
the
way
of
a
go
business
be
how
to
optimize
its
element
the
latitude
for
opinion
or
subjective
judgment
here
be
wide
but
i
think
it
would
be
generally
agree
that
in
principle
debt
enhances
the
return
on
the
stockholder
investment
while
at
the
same
time
increase
the
risk
involve
it
would
be
agree
i
think
that
both
mr
durant
and
mr
raskob
have
a
strong
desire
to
spend
and
have
little
inhibition
about
debt
mr
durant
carry
this
attitude
far
enough
into
practice
in
general
motor
to
create
a
situation
between
and
that
would
more
than
serve
the
expansion
need
of
the
corporation
for
the
follow
six
year
even
so
the
expansion
of
might
have
work
without
crisis
if
it
have
be
assist
by
management
and
financial
control
in
his
personal
affair
it
be
obviously
debt
that
brought
disaster
to
mr
durant
in
the
economic
slump
of
so
much
for
that
it
be
equally
evident
that
from
to
the
corporation
avoid
long
term
debt
i
myself
have
feeling
against
debt
perhaps
because
of
what
i
have
see
of
it
in
my
experience
and
yet
i
cannot
really
say
that
we
have
an
anti
debt
policy
in
that
period
the
fact
show
that
we
be
in
general
able
to
do
without
it
we
need
little
expenditure
up
to
and
from
through
it
be
not
difficult
to
expand
within
the
framework
of
earnings
while
pay
dividend
at
what
we
consider
a
reasonable
rate
in
other
word
we
paid
off
and
grow
without
debt
except
for
bank
loan
during
short
period
in
the
s
the
s
be
a
time
of
contraction
the
question
of
debt
do
not
arise
during
the
war
year
we
arrange
for
a
bank
credit
of
billion
through
the
government
to
finance
receivables
and
inventory
but
borrowing
under
these
arrangement
be
limited
the
maximum
borrowing
be
million
and
be
outstanding
for
less
than
a
year
when
we
come
to
the
postwar
period
however
despite
our
liquidity
we
be
to
meet
all
the
financial
question
again
include
the
necessity
of
provide
for
large
capital
expenditure
and
obtain
additional
capital
fund
through
debt
as
well
as
stock
issue
the
postwar
era
to
over
the
seventeen
year
to
our
plant
expenditure
come
to
more
than
billion
this
amount
be
nearly
seven
time
the
value
of
the
plant
at
the
start
of
the
period
since
increase
cost
due
to
inflation
of
equipment
and
construction
account
for
a
sizable
portion
of
the
postwar
expenditure
this
ratio
do
not
indicate
the
increase
in
physical
volume
net
work
capital
during
the
seventeen
year
increase

from

to
million
of
total

billion
or
percent
be
cover
by
provision
for
depreciation
the
rest
necessarily
have
to
come
from
either
reinvested
earnings
or
new
capital
or
some
combination
of
both
during
these
seventeen
year
general
motor
earn
about
billion
and
retain
over
billion
or
about
percent
a
large
proportion
of
earnings
than
have
be
our
practice
in
the
past
owe
to
the
need
of
the
business
even
so
to
meet
the
plan
expansion
we
have
to
go
to
the
capital
market
for
the
first
time
with
the
minor
exception
note
since
the
early
twenty
for
a
total
of
million
during
the
seventeen
year
period
of
which
by
the
end
of
we
have
make
provision
for
repayment
of
million
in
addition
about
million
of
common
stock
be
issue
principally
for
purpose
of
employee
program
during
the
period
through
hence
between
reinvestment
of
earnings
and
the
sale
of
new
security
the
capital
employ
in
the
business
in
this
period
rise
from
million
to
million
we
begin
our
broad
planning
for
this
postwar
growth
long
before
the
war
end
i
present
a
concept
of
a
postwar
program
in
in
a
speech
call
the
challenge
which
i
make
to
the
national
association
of
manufacturer
i
argue
in
this
speech
that
in
the
postwar
period
industry
would
meet
an
enormous
pent
up
demand
for
its
product
and
we
should
boldly
plan
on
this
assumption
in
do
so
i
argue
against
that
body
of
opinion
among
economist
which
prophesy
economic
doom
after
the
war
and
i
might
add
it
be
for
me
not
only
a
matter
of
argument
but
also
of
lay
the
money
on
the
line
in
other
word
we
recognize
that
an
urgent
need
would
exist
when
the
war
end
to
convert
plant
from
war
to
peace
production
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
satisfy
consumer
demand
provide
peacetime
job
and
fulfill
our
obligation
to
our
shareholder
and
that
all
this
represent
opportunity
accordingly
we
have
our
staff
begin
to
make
long
term
study
of
demand
project
our
position
for
five
to
ten
year
ahead
on
the
basis
of
the
overall
economic
outlook
probable
consumer
demand
and
our
productive
and
financial
capacity
to
meet
the
demand
on
the
basis
of
these
study
i
announce
a
postwar
program
call
for
the
expenditure
of
million
this
be
consider
a
tremendous
sum
and
the
announcement
cause
considerable
comment
it
be
considerably
more
than
the
corporation
have
spent
on
new
facility
in
either
the
s
or
s
and
be
three
fourth
large
than
the
value
of
our
net
plant
at
the
end
of
the
program
as
our
annual
report
summarize
it
involve
the
rearrangement
and
reorganization
of
plant
machine
and
other
facility
to
be
use
in
produce
the
car
truck
and
other
item
that
make
up
general
motor
peacetime
product
it
call
for
the
replacement
of
equipment
sell
to
others
during
the
war
it
provide
for
the
modernization
of
equipment
and
for
replacement
of
worn
tool
of
all
kind
that
have
be
subject
to
severe
wartime
usage
it
include
expansion
of
facility
to
meet
postwar
need
all
in
proper
balance
between
short
term
and
long
term
prospect
so
two
year
before
the
war
end
we
in
general
motor
be
prepare
for
the
day
when
we
could
return
to
mass
production
of
car
and
truck
detailed
expansion
plan
be
developed
for
each
division
and
we
also
make
plan
to
renew
peacetime
relationship
with
the
thousand
of
supplier
and
subcontractor
with
whom
general
motor
have
do
business
before
the
war
many
of
whom
be
associate
with
us
in
war
production
wherever
practicable
for
example
we
advise
our
prewar
supplier
that
they
could
plan
on
order
for
certain
peacetime
good
as
soon
as
war
condition
permit
we
thereby
make
it
possible
for
them
to
make
their
own
postwar
plan
and
reduce
the
time
they
need
for
reconversion
at
the
time
the
postwar
plan
be
formulate
we
expect
that
general
motor
would
be
able
to
finance
the
full
cost
out
of
earnings
and
depreciation
and
other
reserve
as
we
convert
facility
to
war
production
in
and
for
example
we
have
set
aside
reserve
of
million
to
cover
what
we
estimate
would
be
the
cost
of
reconvert
them
back
to
commercial
output
and
we
have
be
accumulate
very
substantial
liquid
asset
against
the
day
when
we
could
again
buy
new
plant
and
equipment
thus
at
the
end
of
we
have
a
net
work
capital
of
million
include
cash
and
short
term
security
total
million
our
wartime
estimate
of
the
cost
of
the
postwar
expansion
program
be
remarkably
accurate
consider
the
degree
of
inflation
that
occur
in
the
cost
of
construction
and
new
capital
good
reconversion
cost
be
million
as
compare
with
our
reserve
of
million
and
total
plant
expenditure
from
through
when
the
first
big
expansion
program
be
substantially
complete
come
to
million
as
compare
with
our
estimate
of
million
our
estimate
of
our
postwar
work
capital
need
however
be
on
the
low
side
these
need
be
increase
greatly
not
only
by
the
expand
volume
of
business
we
be
to
do
in
the
postwar
period
but
also
by
the
tremendous
inflation
which
occur
in
the
prewar
period
our
year
end
net
work
capital
average
million
and
our
inventory
million
for
the
five
postwar
year
net
work
capital
have
increase
to
an
average
of
million
and
inventory
to
million
by
the
end
of
most
of
the
corporation
s
plant
be
close
by
the
united
automobile
worker
strike
and
our
cash
and
investment
in
short
term
security
have
drop
million
to
million
by
the
time
the
strike
be
settle
on
march
liquidity
be
even
low
labor
trouble
continued
in
some
of
the
plant
for
another
sixty
day
and
strike
in
other
industry
create
shortage
of
material
which
held
back
the
rise
in
production
after
our
own
labor
trouble
have
be
solve
as
a
result
the
corporation
be
unable
to
earn
a
satisfactory
profit
during
the
initial
reconversion
period
despite
the
abnormally
high
level
of
demand
in
we
earn
only
million
which
be
million
less
than
our
dividend
payment
even
before
the
strike
have
be
settle
the
corporation
have
determine
that
additional
capital
might
be
need
and
have
request
a
study
and
report
on
possible
financing
by
mid
arrangement
be
complete
to
borrow
million
on
percent
twenty
and
thirty
year
note
from
a
group
of
eight
insurance
company
other
alternative
have
be
explore
but
the
private
placement
of
promissory
note
with
these
institutional
investor
who
have
a
surplus
of
long
term
fund
seem
the
most
expeditious
and
the
cheapest
method
of
financing
the
private
placement
negotiation
be
settle
quickly
and
do
not
entail
the
wait
period
and
filing
of
document
necessary
under
a
public
offering
the
proceeds
of
this
borrowing
be
receive
on
august
and
give
the
corporation
a
good
deal
more
flexibility
in
meeting
its
increase
capital
need
but
the
financial
policy
committee
felt
that
the
corporation
need
still
more
capital
of
a
permanent
nature
and
on
august
it
authorize
mr
bradley
to
negotiate
with
underwriter
with
a
view
to
determine
the
basis
upon
which
it
might
be
possible
to
sell
a
new
issue
of
prefer
stock
the
committee
have
consider
other
method
of
obtain
permanent
capital
one
factor
in
our
decision
be
that
we
could
market
a
prefer
stock
issue
which
we
could
retire
at
will
under
specify
condition
but
which
do
not
have
any
mandatory
provision
require
retirement
by
a
certain
date
as
thing
work
out
however
the
public
market
would
not
absorb
as
much
prefer
stock
as
we
have
hop
except
under
term
we
thought
to
be
too
stringent
as
a
result
the
issue
have
to
be
cut
down
to
million
that
be
one
million
share
of
prefer
offer
at
par
the
stock
be
offer
on
november
and
yield
the
corporation
million
after
underwriting
discount
and
commission
this
be
the
first
public
sale
of
security
by
the
corporation
in
almost
twenty
year
and
be
a
very
successful
offering
some
measure
of
the
drain
on
our
resource
during
the
reconversion
period
be
provide
by
the
fact
that
our
net
work
capital
decline
million
during
and
our
cash
and
short
term
security
drop
million
even
though
we
raise
million
of
new
capital
during
the
year
have
we
not
go
to
the
capital
market
our
net
work
capital
would
have
drop
by
million
during
with
these
new
fund
and
with
the
expansion
program
that
have
already
be
prepared
the
corporation
be
ready
to
move
by
unit
sale
from
our
united
state
and
canadian
plant
have
risen
to
car
and
truck
or
almost
equal
to
the
prewar
high
establish
in
and
net
income
rise
to
million
up
from
million
in
and
only
million
in
unit
sale
establish
an
all
time
high
in
although
general
business
decline
and
our
profit
margin
improve
too
so
that
net
income
go
up
to
million
we
also
be
able
to
raise
our
inventory
turnover
ratio
very
substantially
inventory
decline
million
on
a
billion
rise
in
sale
and
because
our
expansion
program
have
be
complete
our
plant
expenditure
be
relatively
modest
million
in
and
only
million
more
than
our
provision
for
depreciation
our
capital
position
improve
so
rapidly
in
fact
that
we
decide
to
prepay
the
million
note
issue
in
december
of
thereby
eliminate
our
debt
we
be
also
able
to
increase
our
liquidity
and
to
pay
substantial
dividend
our
next
major
expansion
be
an
outgrowth
of
the
korean
war
we
have
learn
from
experience
that
war
create
a
backlog
of
unsatisfied
demand
after
a
good
deal
of
thought
we
conclude
that
the
long
run
potential
of
the
car
market
require
a
large
expansion
of
our
productive
facility
and
justified
spending
corporation
money
on
new
plant
facility
for
defense
production
that
ultimately
could
be
use
for
commercial
operation
i
outline
my
view
in
a
letter
date
november
to
the
member
of
the
financial
policy
committee
with
the
follow
recommendation
we
should
make
a
survey
which
be
under
way
to
determine
the
quantitative
measurement
of
the
trend
of
demand
over
the
next
ten
year
with
particular
reference
to
that
after
five
year
consideration
should
be
give
to
such
peak
as
may
develop
due
to
defer
demand
result
from
the
curtailment
of
production
incidental
to
the
rearmament
program
we
should
develop
a
broad
outline
of
a
master
plan
to
meet
such
prospective
increase
in
production
if
any
as
our
judgment
may
determine
this
should
include
way
and
mean
to
best
carry
out
such
expansion
it
should
embrace
the
various
category
of
production
involve
in
the
corporation
s
present
scheme
of
thing
each
category
follow
its
own
potential
this
broad
outline
should
be
fill
in
as
more
fact
become
available
we
shall
be
call
upon
to
provide
facility
for
the
rearmament
program
such
need
should
be
integrate
with
the
propose
master
plan
in
broad
outline
so
that
we
shall
be
able
to
move
more
rapidly
and
efficiently
when
and
if
the
circumstance
justify
we
should
use
corporation
fund
for
such
new
plant
need
for
armament
if
that
give
us
well
control
over
same
from
the
long
term
position
in
relation
to
the
master
plan
accelerate
depreciation
and
high
tax
make
the
use
of
corporation
fund
all
the
more
feasible
we
should
avoid
conversion
the
policy
should
be
expansion
and
the
policy
be
expansion
indeed
in
the
four
year
through
we
spent
million
on
new
plant
and
equipment
about
one
third
of
it
for
defense
facility
during
this
period
however
our
earnings
be
restrict
by
the
excess
profit
tax
and
by
the
fact
that
the
margin
on
defense
business
under
our
policy
be
low
than
on
commercial
sale
all
told
we
be
able
to
reinvest
million
in
the
business
after
pay
dividend
of
billion
or
percent
of
net
income
these
retain
earnings
together
with
million
in
depreciation
accrual
be
only
million
more
than
plant
expenditure
of
million
only
the
million
be
available
therefore
to
meet
other
requirement
for
example
advance
to
steel
supplier
and
the
cost
of
tool
up
for
defense
production
inflationary
cost
have
left
their
mark
on
the
corporation
s
capital
structure
our
net
work
capital
have
decline
slightly
between
december
and
december
despite
the
need
of
add
capital
due
to
a
percent
rise
in
dollar
sale
at
the
begin
of
with
our
financial
resource
already
under
strain
we
announce
a
forward
program
of
plant
expenditure
call
for
an
outlay
of
billion
in
two
year
this
program
be
design
to
provide
additional
capacity
for
our
automotive
division
to
meet
the
need
of
an
expand
market
and
to
modernize
the
exist
facility
we
also
have
to
add
very
substantially
to
our
facility
for
the
production
of
automatic
transmission
power
steer
power
brake
and
v
engine
with
a
plant
expenditure
program
of
this
magnitude
and
the
inflationary
pressure
on
cost
it
be
clear
that
we
would
have
to
raise
new
capital
if
we
be
to
continue
to
pay
out
a
substantial
part
of
each
year
s
earnings
in
the
form
of
dividend
toward
the
end
of
the
financial
policy
committee
review
the
problem
and
determine
that
a
debt
issue
could
be
sell
to
advantage
in
contrast
to
the
situation
in
however
the
insurance
company
and
other
institutional
investor
do
not
have
any
excess
fund
available
they
be
instead
commit
for
some
time
ahead
hence
we
turn
to
the
public
market
and
in
december
sell
an
issue
of
million
of
twenty
five
year
percent
debenture
net
after
deduct
underwriter
fee
and
commission
million
this
too
be
an
outstanding
success
but
it
be
still
not
enough
in
january
of
our
plant
expenditure
program
be
expand
from
billion
to
billion
and
later
to
billion
in
analyze
our
future
capital
requirement
therefore
we
decide
that
we
would
need
to
raise
more
outside
capital
as
mr
curtice
then
president
of
the
corporation
state
before
the
united
state
senate
committee
on
banking
and
currency
in
march
of
that
year
our
recent
decision
to
seek
far
outside
capital
result
from
our
analysis
of
our
forward
capital
requirement
this
analysis
be
base
upon
our
projection
of
economic
trend
and
the
outlook
for
the
highly
competitive
automobile
market
it
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
additional
permanent
equity
capital
in
the
area
of
to
million
dollar
be
need
if
we
be
to
be
ready
to
share
in
the
country
s
growth
and
meet
expand
need
for
the
good
we
make
and
at
the
same
time
maintain
a
reasonable
dividend
policy
and
so
in
february
we
offer
holder
of
common
stock
the
right
to
subscribe
to
share
of
new

five

at
the
rate
of
one

for
each
twenty

held
the
subscription
price
for
each
new
share
be
at
the
closing
date
of
the
offering
the
stock
be
sell
at
the
stock
offer
be
underwritten
by
a
group
of
underwriter
but
the
underwriter
have
to
subscribe
to
only
percent
of
the
issue
the
net
proceeds
to
the
corporation
approximate
million
after
payment
of
underwriting
fee
and
commission
this
be
the
large
industrial
common
stock
issue
in
the
united
state
up
to
that
time
and
be
a
remarkable
success
attest
to
the
correct
evaluation
of
the
market
at
a
time
when
many
expert
consider
an
issue
of
this
size
to
be
a
great
risk
our
stock
and
debenture
issue
make
it
possible
for
us
to
carry
out
our
expansion
program
and
at
the
same
time
continue
our
policy
of
pay
liberal
dividend
in
the
three
year
of
expansion
through
we
spent
million
on
new
plant
and
equipment
increase
our
gross
plant
percent
from
million
to
million
provision
for
depreciation
total
million
and
after
pay
out
million
or
percent
of
earnings
in
dividend
we
reinvested
million
as
a
result
our
net
work
capital
increase
by
million
during
this
period
of
extraordinary
capital
expenditure
and
our
holding
of
cash
and
short
term
security
exclusive
of
security
earmark
for
payment
of
tax
liability
almost
double
from
million
to
million
our
liquidity
increase
still
more
in
since
capital
expenditure
decline
fairly
rapidly
with
the
completion
of
the
big
expansion
program
while
depreciation
accrual
continued
to
rise
we
have
come
through
a
critical
expansion
and
our
financial
condition
be
strong
than
ever
the
period
through
be
to
include
two
recession
year
and
and
also
the
best
year
for
dollar
sale
and
earnings
in
the
corporation
s
history
in
review
the
event
of
this
period
i
feel
that
they
offer
indisputable
evidence
of
our
financial
maturity
the
recession
year
saw
general
motor
sale
of
u
s
produce
car
and
truck
decline
percent
from
the
previous
year
yet
the
accelerate
impact
that
decline
unit
sale
have
on
earnings
be
effectively
moderate
earnings
in
of
per
share
be
only
percent
less
than
the
per
share
in
these
result
be
due
in
no
small
part
to
the
effective
and
timely
financial
control
which
we
have
built
into
our
organization
over
the
year
plant
expenditure
in
the
period
include
the
cost
of
overseas
expansion
project
total
billion
or
about
as
much
as
be
spent
in
the
major
expansion
year
of
nevertheless
depreciation
accrual
be
sufficient
to
finance
these
expenditure
in
the
united
state
while
local
borrowing
be
use
to
finance
a
portion
of
the
expansion
in
germany
as
a
result
the
corporation
be
able
to
pay
out
billion
in
dividend
over
the
period
or
percent
of

in
addition
net
work
capital
be
increase
billion
take
the
postwar
period
as
a
whole
therefore
the
shareholder
fare
rather
well
notwithstanding
a
well
than
six
fold
increase
in
the
state
dollar

be

we
nevertheless
paid

a
total
of

in

over
the

after
adjust

price
of
a

of

rise
from
to
the
financial
story
of

be
a
story
of

in

in
the
number
of

in

the

this
be
a
measure
of
the
significance
of
general

as
an
institution
in
american
economic
life
the
measure
of
the
worth

as
a

however
be
not
merely
growth
in

return
on
the

since
it
be
their

that

risk
and
it
be
in
their
interest
first
of
all
that
the

be
suppose
to
be
run
in
the
private
enterprise
scheme
of
thing
the
record
show
i
believe
that
we
have
do
a
very
creditable
job
for
the
shareholder
without
neglect
our
responsibility
to
our
employee
customer
dealer
supplier
and
the
community
i
described
my
philosophy
of
financial
growth
in
the
annual
report
for
as
follow
due
to
the
force
of
economic
necessity
and
through
a
process
of
evolution
the
unit
of
industry
have
become
large
and
large
this
be
because
of
the
continuously
broadening
market
for
industry
s
product
and
service
result
from
the
production
of
more
useful
thing
at
continually
lower
price
there
be
superimpose
upon
this
evolutionary
process
the
additional
influence
of
an
increase
integration
of
manufacturing
process
involve
in
mass
production
the
effect
of
such
an
evolution
on
the
capital
structure
be
to
require
ever
increase
amount
of
capital
the
financial
growth
of
general
motor
have
follow
that
course
the
total
capital
employ
in
the
business
have
grown
from
about
million
in
to
about
billion
today
without
unduly
burdening
the
corporation
or
its
shareholder
with
debt
primarily
by
plow
back
earnings
of
the
billion
growth

ethyl
gasoline
and
high
compression
engine
the
central
problem
in
automotive
engineering
have
be
to
develop
a
more
satisfactory
relationship
between
the
fuel
and
the
engine
the
efficiency
of
a
piston
engine
its
ability
to
make
an
effective
use
of
fuel
and
thus
to
get
the
great
power
from
a
give
quantity
of
fuel
depends
on
its
compression
the
concept
of
compression
be
a
simple
one
but
the
general
reader
will
need
a
few
word
about
it
the
piston
have
one
position
in
which
it
be
as
far
down
in
the
engine
s
cylinder
as
it
can
go
and
another
in
which
it
be
as
far
up
in
the
cylinder
as
it
can
go
when
it
be
at
the
bottom
of
its
stroke
the
cylinder
be
fill
with
fuel
a
mixture
of
atomize
gasoline
and
air
when
it
be
at
the
top
of
its
stroke
the
fuel
charge
be
compress
the
fuel
begin
to
burn
as
a
result
of
the
spark
and
the
hot
gas
produce
will
expand
and
push
the
piston
down
the
down
movement
then
turn
the
crankshaft
which
transmits
power
to
the
wheel
the
compression
ratio
be
the
ratio
between
the
volume
of
the
cylinder
when
the
piston
be
as
far
down
as
it
can
go
and
the
volume
that
remains
when
it
be
as
far
up
as
it
can
go
this
ratio
merely
compare
the
volume
of
the
fuel
charge
in
its
uncompressed
state
with
that
in
its
compress
state
in
the
early
twenty
the
average
compression
ratio
be
about
four
to
one
as
i
have
say
to
design
a
more
efficient
and
powerful
engine
of
a
give
size
mean
to
increase
the
compression
ratio
but
here
a
serious
problem
stood
in
the
way
engine
knock
the
gasoline
and
air
mixture
should
burn
relatively
slowly
in
order
to
push
the
piston
down
if
it
detonate
burn
too
fast
the
piston
could
not
move
rapidly
enough
to
take
advantage
of
the
force
generate
indeed
not
only
be
energy
lose
in
engine
knock
but
the
sudden
force
introduce
severe
strain
on
the
engine
part
which
could
and
do
damage
the
engine
the
key
to
high
compression
be
to
find
some
way
of
reduce
engine
knock
but
what
be
the
cause
of
engine
knock
in
the
early
day
of
motorcar
use
it
be
discover
that
one
could
reduce
engine
knock
by
adjust
the
time
of
the
spark
jump
most
car
for
many
year
have
a

operate

adjustment
lever
convenient
to
the
driver
for
choose
the
best
spark
set
for
different
drive
condition
people
learn
to
retard
the
spark
set
by
hand
when
drive
uphill
to
prevent
engine
knock
as
the
engine
labor
under
the
strain
the
man
who
begin
general
motor
important
study
in
engine
knock
and
who
be
largely
responsible
for
our
breakthrough
to
a
solution
of
the
problem
be
charles
f
kettering
who
have
long
be
interested
in
the
whole
question
of
ignition
fuel
and
the
like
no
automobile
run
and
no
airplane
with
a
reciprocate
engine
fly
today
without
benefit
of
the
antiknock
fuel
development
pioneer
by
mr
kettering
he
brought
his
early
knowledge
of
this
problem
to
general
motor
and
he
be
research
chief
of
general
motor
when
the
solution
be
found
the
solution
in
the
main
be
ethyl
gasoline
make
with
the
additive
tetraethyl
lead
up
to
the
time
of
world
war
i
knock
be
thought
to
be
cause
by
too
early
ignition
when
the
spark
be
too
far
advanced
soon
after
world
war
i
it
be
discover
that
there
be
another
kind
of
knock
which
be
call
fuel
knock
for
by
change
only
the
fuel
and
fuel
set
without
adjust
the
spark
this
knock
could
be
lessen
or
eliminate
one
of
the
people
work
on
this
problem
be
the
late
thomas
midgley
jr
he
have
come
up
through
the
dayton
engineering
laboratory
where
he
be
an
assistant
to
mr
kettering
to
become
in
the
early
s
the
chief
of
the
fuel
section
of
the
general
motor
research
corporation
in
the
word
of
dr
robert
e
wilson
formerly
chairman
of
standard
oil
of
indiana
and
a
close
friend
of
mr
midgley
mr
midgley
have
definitely
proven
that
contrary
to
general
belief
knock
and
preignition
be
different
thing
and
that
knock
be
a
chemical
characteristic
of
the
fuel
he
point
out
that
benzol
and
cyclohexane
which
latter
he
have
succeed
in
make
in
his
dayton
laboratory
knock
much
less
than
gasoline
and
gasoline
much
less
than
kerosene
almost
every
time
i
saw
tom
he
have
some
new
theory
regard
the
mechanism
of
detonation
or
of
antiknock
action
on
which
i
be
the
professional
skeptic
while
successive
theory
be
usually
discredit
by
far
experimental
work
they
be
always
stimulate
and
frequently
lead
to
discovery
of
importance
the
most
strike
example
of
this
be
in
his
early
work
when
he
be
try
to
theorize
as
to
why
kerosene
knock
bad
than
gasoline
he
seize
upon
the
obvious
difference
in
volatility
and
postulate
that
possibly
most
of
the
kerosene
remain
in
droplet
until
after
combustion
start
and
then
vaporize
very
suddenly
with
a
resultant
too
rapid
explosion
if
this
explanation
be
correct
he
reason
that
by
dye
the
kerosene
it
might
be
possible
to
make
the
droplet
absorb
radiant
heat
from
the
combustion
chamber
and
hence
vaporize
sooner
have
tom
be
a
good
physicist
he
could
have
doubtless
found
by
calculation
that
this
theory
be
untenable
but
be
a
mechanical
engineer
he
fortunately
decide
that
it
be
much
easy
to
try
it
out
than
to
do
the
calculation
he
accordingly
go
to
the
stockroom
in
search
of
some
oil
soluble
dye
and
as
usual
the
stockroom
be
just
out
of
the
desire
product
however
fred
chase
suggest
that
iodine
be
oil
soluble
and
would
color
the
kerosene
so
tom
promptly
dissolve
a
substantial
quantity
of
iodine
in
the
kerosene
test
it
in
a
moderately
high
compression
engine
and
found
to
his
delight
that
the
knock
be
eliminate
tom
immediately
sent
out
to
scour
dayton
for
all
available
sample
of
oil
soluble
dye
and
that
afternoon
test
out
several
different
one
in
rapid
succession
without
get
the
slightest
result
from
any
of
them
to
clinch
the
matter
he
add
a
colorless
iodine
compound
to
the
gasoline
and
found
that
this
stop
the
knock
thus
the
first
theory
of
detonation
go
to
start
the
graveyard
which
be
now
fairly
well
fill
but
along
with
its
demise
come
the
real
birth
of
tom
as
a
chemist
and
for
the
next
few
year
he
be
an
insatiable
student
of
every
branch
of
chemistry
to
aid
him
in
endeavor
to
explain
his
observation
and
to
make
new
compound
for
trial
as
antiknock
agent
tom
be
then
particularly
enthusiastic
about
the
possibility
of
aniline
though
as
always
seem
to
be
the
case
when
he
discover
a
new
antiknock
agent
he
have
to
go
to
work
to
improve
the
method
of
manufacture
and
low
the
cost
before
the
agent
would
be
economically
feasible
he
also
have
some
hope
then
for
his
first
ethyl
compound
ethyl
iodide
if
he
could
just
locate
a
plentiful
source
of
iodine
it
be
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
society
of
automotive
engineer
in
new
york
in
january
that
tom
with
an
air
of
great
excitement
and
secrecy
show
me
a
little
tetraethyl
lead
in
a
test
tube
and
told
me
that
that
be
really
the
answer
to
the
whole
problem
its
efficiency
he
say
be
very
much
high
than
that
of
any
previously
discover
compound
and
it
appear
to
be
free
from
every
one
of
the
difficulty
which
have
plague
earlier
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
of
course
he
do
not
yet
appreciate
either
the
toxicity
or
the
deposit
problem
so
after
all
the
year
of
experiment
by
mr
kettering
mr
midgley
and
general
motor
research
corporation
we
have
the
invention
but
have
an
invention
be
one
thing
and
get
to
market
with
it
be
another
to
make
a
long
story
short
in
august
of
a
corporation
be
form
call
the
ethyl
gasoline
corporation
for
the
purpose
of
marketing
tetraethyl
lead
as
an
antiknock
compound
this
company
be
a
fifty
fifty
partnership
between
general

and
standard

of
new
jersey
initially
the
ethyl
fluid
be
manufacture
by
du
pont
under
a
contract
and
it
be
not
until
that
ethyl
begin
produce
all
of
its
own
requirement
tetraethyl
lead
be
only
one
of
the
necessary
step
in
the
development
of
high
compression
engine
despite
its
effect
in
improve
the
quality
of
the
fuel
the
fuel
itself
in
the
early
twenty
varied
enormously
in
quality
indeed
there
be
no
know
way
of
measure
one
fuel
against
another
to
determine
its
relative
value
for
use
in
a
gasoline
engine
general
motor
make
a
study
of
that
situation
and
developed
a
method
for
measure
the
antiknock
quality
of
fuel
or
the
ability
of
the
engine
to
accept
a

octane
be
a
fuel
with
almost
no
knock
in
the
engineering
of
that
day
a
rating
of

therefore
be
consider
practically
speak
a
perfect

dr
graham
edgar
of
ethyl
conceive
the
octane
scale
in
and
mr
kettering
and
the
research
engineer
developed
the
first
single
cylinder
variable

test
engine
by
which

later
adopt
as
standard
by
the
automotive
and
petroleum
industry
of
course
one
way
to
increase
octane
rating
be
to
add
tetraethyl
lead
but
another
be
through

process
for

tremendous
progress
have
be
make
in
crack
and
in
re

the
hydrocarbon
found
in
crude
oil
both
to
increase
the
yield
of
gasoline
from
a
barrel
of
crude
and
to
improve
its
octane
rating
before
the
addition
of
tetraethyl
lead
this
be
another
dramatic
research
story
in
itself
and
one
in
which
mr
kettering
and
his
associate
played
a
very
important
part
in
pioneer
the
octane
rating
of
commercial
gasoline
available
at
fill
station
be
increase
from
to
in
the
early
twenty
to
to
somewhat
over
at
the
present
time
in
aviation
gasoline
octane
rating
be
even
high
this
have
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
fuel
economy
as
measure
in
car
mile
per
gallon
for
a
give
standard
of

and
consequently
on
the
efficiency
with
which
we
be
today
use
our
petroleum
resource
general
motor
role
in
the
ethyl
corporation
come
to
a
close
in
when
both
general
motor
and
standard
oil
sell
their
interest
in
ethyl
to
the
albemarle
paper
manufacturing
company
of
richmond
virginia
with
this
sale
general

in
line
with
its
policy
dispose
of
the
last
of
its
investment
in
partially
own
company
and
now
carry
on
all
of
its
operation
through
division
or
wholly
own
subsidiary
another
factor
in
the
reduction
of
knock
be
the
design
of
the
engine
itself
we
know
today
that
in
the
engine
combustion
chamber
a
very
complex
shock
wave
condition
be
produce
by
the
explosion
of
the
fuel
these
shock
wave
can
increase
the
temperature
of
the
fuel
very
rapidly
and
contribute
to
detonation
and
knock
the
study
of
various

have
suggest
special
shape
for
the
least
knock
effect
with
the
high

parenthetically
i
will
mention
here
one
problem
of
engine
design
quite
independent
of
the

a
serious
limit

make
an
important
contribution
to
its
solution
vibration
which
be
always
unpleasant
become
a
more
critical
engineering
problem
as
speed
and
power
start
to
go
up
then
the
unbalanced
rotate
and
reciprocate
part
in
the
engine
become
the
source
of
destructive
vibration
and
a
limit
factor
on
the
whole
progress
of
the
automobile
one
of
the
principal
source
of
vibration
be
the
crankshaft
the
backbone
of
the
engine
where
any
imbalance
be
felt
throughout
the
engine
and
the
car
general

research
corporation
begin
work
in
the
early
twenty
on
the
problem
of

and
a
crankshaft
balance
machine
be
developed
and
first
use
in
the
production
of
the
cadillac
engine
this
machine
hundred
of
which
be
now
in
use
throughout
the
world
be
exclusively
a
general
motor
development
and
give
us
a
long
lead
in
engine
balance
in
the
industry
as
in
the
case
of
many
of
our
advance
we
arrange
to
sell
this
equipment
to
other
engine
producer
well
balance
be
a
very
important
step
in
the
reduction
of
wear
and
tear
on
the
whole
automobile
structure
and
in
permit
faster
progress
toward
the
satisfactory
utilization
of
great
power
and
speed
in
practically
all
the
engine
we
build
as
we
learn
more
and
more
about
knock
progress
toward
high
compression
engine
become
possible
from
the
four
to
one
compression
ratio
of
the
early
twenty
we
have
now
come
to
ten
to
one
and
high
compression
ratio
the
development
of
fuel
and
engine
proceeds
in
leap
frog
fashion
an
engine
with
high
compression
demand
a
well
fuel
and
the
availability
of
a
well
fuel
encourages
the
production
of
more
efficient
engine
under
the
urge
of
the
automobile
engineer
the
petroleum
industry
have
developed
fuel
of
high
and
high
octane
rating
for
general
use
general
motor
have
supply
many
high
compression
test
engine
to
the
oil
industry
to
help
it
develop
high
octane
fuel
in
this
way
the
development
of
tetraethyl
lead
and
high
octane
fuel
have
make
possible
the
long
range
improvement
of
the
internal
combustion
engine
transmission
development
i
suppose
almost
everybody
know
that
the
purpose
of
the
transmission
be
to
transfer
power
from
the
engine
to
the
wheel
of
a
car
and
that
this
involves
a
change
in
the
speed
relationship
between
the
automobile
engine
and
wheel
the
power
developed
by
an
engine
depends
on
several
thing
but
be
closely
related
primarily
to
the
rotational
speed
of
the
engine
s
crankshaft
with
the
old
low
power
car
everyone
become
aware
of
this
upon
climb
a
hill
this
usually
require
a
vigorous
speed
up
of
the
engine
and
a
shift
to
a
low
gear
to
get
the
power
need
back
in
the
s
shift
gear
by
hand
through
the
normal
three
speed
usually
result
in
considerable
clash
unless
the
driver
have
a
high
degree
of
skill
from
the
time
the
general
motor
research
corporation
be
set
up
in
transmission
be
an
important
subject
of
study
and
discussion
at
first
we
concentrate
on
electrical
transmission
of
various
type
for
a
large
percentage
of
the
original
staff
of
engineer
be
of
electrical
background
an
electrical
drive
be
developed
and
one
of
this
type
be
use
for
a
time
on
general
motor
bus
the
electrical
transmission
which
be
try
out
very
early
in
the
history
of
the
automobile
in
the
columbia
and
owen
magnetic
passenger
car
eventually
receive
its
major
commercial
use
in
the
large
vehicle
field
this
special
form
of
transmission
be
use
today
in
our
diesel
locomotive
from
on
the
interest
of
our
research
organization
in
electrical
transmission
for
passenger
car
decline
we
begin
to
study
a
wide
variety
of
automatic
transmission
include
the
infinitely
variable
type
in
which
a
large
number
of

be
available
in
uninterrupted
sequence
rather
than
a
lesser
number
in
fix
step
as
in
the
standard
transmission
and
the
step
ratio
type
in
which
a
fix
number
of

could
be
select
automatically

as
early
as
the
middle
twenty
a

most
of
the
general
principle
that
go
into
the
make
of
the
fully
automatic

be
thus
know
to
us
and
be
be
carefully
investigate
at
least
fifteen
year
before
automatic
transmission
become
available
in
production
car
in
the
late
twenty
general
motor
developed
the
synchromesh
gearshift
with
which
almost
any
driver
could
shift
from
one
speed
to
another
without
clash
the
gear
this
significant
development
be
put
into

by
cadillac
in
the
principle
be
take
up
by
other

and
be
far
developed
for
large
volume
production
by
our
old
muncie

by
we
be
able
to
extend

all
the
way
down
through
the
whole

line
to
the
chevrolet

by
the
research
laboratory
have
reach
a
consensus
on
an
automatic

assign
the
job
of
develop
this

since
we
have
no
general

at
that
time
many

and
it

finally
determine
to

in
however
despite
our
best
effort
we
never
manage
to
solve
all
the

and
this

a
good
deal
of
course
have
be
learn
about
the

but
it
turn
out
that
this
specific
steel

not
the
answer
to
the
problem
i
be
convince
that
it
would
always
cost
too
much
and
i
turn
it
down
for
our

our
research

continued
to
work
on
the

the
buick
division
and
still
require
the
use
of
a
main
clutch
pedal
for
start
and
stop
our
engineer
now
discover
that
the
main
clutch
and
its
pedal
could
be
eliminate
by
the
use
of
a
fluid
couple
built
within
the
transmission
assembly
this
feature
together
with
the
development
of
full
range
automatic
control
result
in
the
hydra
matic
transmission
produce
by
the
newly
organize
detroit
transmission
division
it
be
announce
in
october
and
first
appear
on
the
oldsmobile
the
cadillac
division
be
the
next
to
accept
the
new
transmission
for
its
model
meanwhile
a
different
kind
of
automatic
transmission
be
under
development
by
the
gmc
truck
coach
engineering
staff
this
be
know
as
a
torque
converter
of
the
close
circuit
fluid
turbine
type
such
device
contain
a
set
of
bladed
wheel
the
blade
be
set
at
angle
so
that
one
bladed
wheel
driven
directly
by
the
spin
of
the
engine
can
pump
the
body
of
contain
fluid
into
a
second
bladed
wheel
connect
to
the
drive
shaft
and
so
cause
turn
force
on
that
shaft
there
may
be
additional
bladed
wheel
for
change
the
fluid
flow
characteristic
and
in
this
way
affect
the
difference
in
speed
between
the
engine
and
the
drive
shaft
in
other
word
their
speed
ratio
this
ratio
in
a
fluid
torque
converter
change
imperceptibly
and
gradually
rather
than
by
a
series
of
step
the
net
drive
effect
be
therefore
very
smooth
the
fluid
torque
converter
design
with
which
general
motor
engineer
first
work
have
be
developed
in
europe
they
eventually
design
one
which
conform
well
to
american
bus
operating
standard
we
first
use
such
a
transmission
in
in
our
own
bus
and
it
be
soon
widely
accepted
on
the
eve
of
the
war
in
october
our
engineering
staff
transmission
development
group
be
at
work
on
the
problem
of
adapt
the
fluid
torque
converter
to
passenger
car
with
america
s
entry
into
the
war
our
advanced
work
on
automatic
transmission
for
passenger
car
be
suspend
but
an
enormous
new
field
for
automatic
transmission
open
for
the
passenger
car
driver
the
automatic
transmission
be
of
value
because
of
its
convenience
and
simplicity
in
operation
there
be
one
less
thing
about
drive
a
car
he
have
to
think
about
when
it
come
to
bus
truck
tank
tractor
and
the
huge
vehicle
of
modern
warfare
automatic
transmission
be
need
for
smooth
function
as
early
as
we
have
be
urge
by
the
military
engineer
to
think
about
the
problem
of
design
transmission
for
large
vehicle
such
as
the
m
and
m
tank
at
this
time
these
be
steer
by
lever
and
in
some
case
the
operator
have
to
let
go
of
one
of
the
steer
lever
in
order
to
shift
gear
in
do
this
he
temporarily
abandon
steer
control
furthermore
the
speed
of
the
vehicle
during
the
gear
change
interval
would
fall
off
rapidly
and
perhaps
cause
a
stall
thus
present
a
stationary
target
the
engineering
staff
transmission
development
group
design
heavy
duty
hydra
matics
for
these
tank
but
there
be
heavier
tank
be
plan
to
carry
big
gun
and
more
armor
and
for
these
we
explore
the
possibility
of
apply
the
fluid
torque
converter
shortly
after
our
entry
into
the
war
the
engineering
staff
built
a
pilot
model
of
a
fluid
torque
converter
which
solve
the
problem
of
maintain
vehicle
motion
while
the
ratio
between
the
speed
of
the
engine
and
the
speed
of
the
vehicle
be
be
change
large
number
of
these
transmission
be
built
during
world
war
ii
by
general
motor
division
our
transmission
development
group
also
design
a
specialized
tank
transmission
and
steer
system
know
as
the
cross
drive
this
make
it
possible
for
a
driver
to
control
accurately
with
a
relatively
small
effort
the
steer
brake
and
automatic
drive
of
big
vehicle
of
more
than
fifty
ton
these
cross
drive
go
into
gun
carrier
amphibious
and
regular
cargo
carrier
and
other
vehicle
of
tremendous
weight
and
our
development
work
in
this
field
continued
after
the
war
with
the
war
s
end
the
engineering
staff
begin
an
intensive
research
program
design
to
adapt
the
fluid
torque
converter
to
passenger
car
this
program
be
successful
and
lead
to
the
buick
dynaflow
of
and
the
chevrolet
powerglide
of
the
line
the
dynaflow
be
the
first
fluid

converter
produce
in
volume
for
passenger
car
thus
by
after
many
year
of
research
and
engineering
development
general

offer
to
the
public
two
different
fully

and
the
fluid

produce
economically
and
efficiently
even
for
low

buying
public
show
its

its
willingness
to
pay

other
automobile
manufacturer
use
them
in

as
soon
as
they
could
and
in
some
case
the
automatic

use
in

be
built
for
them
by

about
five

be
market
by
the
industry
of
which
about
million
be
on
general

thus
this
optional
device
have
become
an
establish
feature
of
the
american
automobile
balloon
tire
and
front
wheel
suspension
from
the
begin
the
problem
of
supply
a
smoother
and
softer
ride
have
be
one
of
the
most
complex
in
automotive
engineering
since
a
car
go
much
faster
than
a
horse
drawn
vehicle
it
communicate
the
irregularity
in
the
road
surface
to
the
passenger
with
great
intensity
the
internal
combustion
engine
add
its
own
source
of
discomfort
in
the
form
of
vibration
consequently
improvement
in
the
cushion
of
the
driver
and
passenger
be
necessary
and
this
need
increase
as
car
become
speedier
one
basic
approach
to
this
problem
be
through
the
tire
early
motorcar
have
use
solid
rubber
or
vent
solid
rubber
tire
these
be
soon
replace
by
inflate
tire
but
in
this
early
stage
neither
the
rubber
nor
the
construction
be
good
enough
and
interminable
tire
change
be
a
sad
necessity
on
any
extend
trip
by
the
early
twenty
the
rubber
company
have
learn
a
good
deal
about
construction
method
chemistry
rubber
cure
and
selection
of
material
tire
be
much
well
and
engineer
begin
to
consider
the
possibility
of
low
pressure
tire
which
would
create
a
softer
and
more
resilient
air
cushion
under
the
wheel
many
problem
have
to
be
met
particularly
in
connection
with
steer
and
ride
the
engineer
have
to
deal
with
front
end
instability
scuff
of
the
tread
squeal
on
turn
drive
under
fast
brake
condition
and
a
peculiar
condition
know
as
wheel
tramp
cause
by
a
slight
imbalance
of
the
rotate
mass
of
tire
and
wheel
these
phenomenon
do
not
show
up
as
major
problem
until
car
owner
begin
to
take
long
road
trip
at
high
speed
during
this
development
of
modern
low
pressure
tire
general
motor
engineer
make
important
contribution
because
of
our
many
mile
of
test
road
work
under
vary
condition
the
general
technical
committee
from
the
first
maintain
close
contact
with
the
tire
industry
cooperate
in
standardization
of
size
and
in
the
establishment
of
the
best
type
tread
and
section
our
recommendation
base
on
our
research
have
be
incorporate
year
after
year
in
well
and
safer
tire
the
second
basic
approach
to
the
improvement
of
the
ride
and
one
of
great
engineering
complexity
be
by
way
of
the
suspension
the
attachment
of
the
wheel
to
the
chassis
in
one
of
my
early
trip
abroad
my
attention
be
call
to
an
engineering
development
use
in
the
production
of
european
car
the
independent
spring
of
the
front
wheel
up
to
that
time
independent
spring
have
not
be
use
in
production
car
in
the
united
state
the
use
of
this
principle
of
course
would
add
considerably
to
the
comfort
of
the
ride
in
france
i
come
in
contact
with
an
engineer
name
andr
dubonnet
who
have
give
considerable
study
to
the
matter
and
have
take
out
a
patent
on
one
form
of
independent
spring
i
brought
him
back
to
this
country
and
put
him
in
contact
with
our
engineer
quite
independently
lawrence
p
fisher
then
general
manager
of
our
cadillac
division
have
engage
a
former
roll
royce
engineer
maurice
olley
who
also
be
interested
in
work
on
the
problem
of
ride
mr
olley
record
his
recollection
of
the
development
of
independent
suspension
in
a
letter
he
have
write
for
me
i
will
continue
the
story
in
his
word
you
have
ask
for
my
recollection
of
independent
suspension
on
general
motor
car
you
ll
have
to
excuse
the
very
personal
atmosphere
of
the
follow
note
which
may
give
the
impression
that
independent
suspension
be
a
one
man
show
it
be
very
far
from
that
and
owes
a
great
deal
to
henry
crane
ernest
seaholm
chief
engineer
of
cadillac
charles
kettering
and
a
number
of
cadillac
and
buick
engineer
also
to
the
tolerance
and
constant
support
of
l
p
fisher
who
accuse
the
writer
at
that
time
of
be
the
first
man
in
gm
to
spend
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollar
in
building
two
experimental
car
you
will
recall
that
i
come
from
roll
royce
to
cadillac
in
november
of
frankly
i
be
surprised
to
find
roll
royce
so
popular
a
roll
royce
car
have
just
complete
a
phenomenal
test
at
the
new
gm
prove
ground
and
have
be
torn
down
for
inspection
at
roll
royce
for
the
past
several
year
we
have
be
engage
in
a
concentrate
drive
on
rid
quality
the
british
factory
have
become
intrigue
by
this
work
because
of
the
fact
that
car
which
be
consider
acceptable
on
british
road
be
far
from
acceptable
when
export
even
to
the
improve
road
of
the
united
state
and
we
be
begin
to
realize
that
this
be
not
because
american
road
be
bad
but
because
the
wave
in
them
be
a
different
shape
a
great
deal
of
work
have
be
do
at
roll
royce
along
the
line
of
swing
car
from
overhead
pivot
to
measure
their
moment
of
inertia
measure
the
stiffness
of
chassis
frame
and
coachwork
and
measure
the
suspension
rate
of
the
spring
as
instal
on
the
actual
car
the
british
factory
have
also
developed
one
of
the
first
practical
ride
meter
which
consist
simply
in
measure
how
much
water
be
lose
from
an
open
topped
container
in
a
measure
mile
at
various
speed
some
of
this
practice
have
be
carry
over
to
cadillac
in
and
soon
we
also
be
swing
car
measure
instal
spring
rate
etc
we
also
built
ourselves
a
bump
rig
along
the
roll
royce
line
the
first
in
detroit
and
use
it
to
produce
a
synthetic
ride
on
a
stationary
car
early
in
we
built
the
k
rig
consist
of
a
complete
seven
passenger
limousine
on
which
it
be
possible
by
move
weight
to
produce
any
desire
change
in
relative
deflection
of
front
and
rear
spring
and
in
the
moment
of
inertia
of
the
vehicle
no
instrumentation
be
use
on
this
to
measure
ride
with
the
assistance
of
henry
crane
to
check
up
on
our
effort
we
simply
ask
ourselves
under
which
condition
we
get
the
best
ride
this
be
the
best
method
because
we
do
not
know
then
and
do
not
know
today
what
a
good
ride
be
but
we
could
make
so
many
fundamental
change
in
ride
on
this
vehicle
in
a
single
day
s
run
that
our
impression
remain
fresh
and
direct
comparison
be
possible
it
be
at
this
stage
early
in
that
we
begin
to
feel
the
urge
towards
independent
suspension
the
k
rig
be
tell
us
in
no
uncertain
term
that
a
flat
ride
which
be
an
entirely
new
experience
be
possible
if
we
use
front
spring
which
be
softer
than
the
rear
but
you
will
recall
that
all
attempt
to
use
extremely
soft
front
spring
with
the
conventional
front
axle
fell
down
badly
because
of
shimmy
and
a
general
lack
of
stability
in
handle
the
next
step
after
the
k
rig
therefore
consist
in
building
two
experimental
cadillac
car
these
have
two
different
independent
front
suspension
one
of
these
be
that
developed
by
mr
dubonnet
the
other
the
wishbone
type
we
have
developed
an
independent
rear
suspension
be
also
use
as
we
have
in
mind
that
as
soon
as
possible
we
should
also
get
rid
of
the
conventional
rear
axle
a
change
which
in
my
own
opinion
be
now
several
year
overdue
on
these
car
which
be
ridden
by
many
of
the
corporation
engineer
it
be
evident
that
we
have
something
very
special
in
the
way
of
improve
ride
and
handle
we
also
ran
into
our
usual
share
of
trouble
the
chief
of
these
be
the
steer
which
especially
on
the
wishbone
suspension
be
not
free
from
shimmy
we
have
to
redesign
the
steer
mechanism
several
time
finally
by
march
of
we
be
ready
for
a
full
dress
demonstration
early
in
march
the
general
technical
committee
met
at
the
cadillac
engineering
building
to
ride
our
two
experimental
car
and
a
buick
car
without
independent
front
suspension
but
with
an
i
v
infinitely
variable
transmission
i
recall
that
you
and
mr
grant
be
rid
one
of
the
wishbone
type
car
when
ernest
seaholm
and
i
in
one
of
the
accompany
car
pull
up
alongside
you
at
the
traffic
light
in
river
rouge
we
could
see
you
smile
widely
at
dick
grant
vice
president
of
sale
in
the
rear
seat
and
move
the
flat
of
your
hand
up
and
down
and
horizontally
within
two
mile
from
the
cadillac
plant
the
flat
ride
have
sell
itself
after
the
run
to
monroe
and
back
on
the
three
car
the
committee
sat
at
the
cadillac
plant
and
seaholm
and
i
in
the
background
await
the
verdict
with
the
pious
hope
that
cadillac
would
be
grant
a
clear
year
s
run
on
the
new
suspension
ahead
of
the
other
division
o
e
hunt
vice
president
of
engineering
i
recall
lead
off
by
ask
mr
grant
what
he
thought
of
the
new
automatic
transmission
you
will
recall
that
in
march
of
there
be
not
a
bank
open
in
the
united
state
and
anyone
who
own
a
farm
be
thankful
that
at
least
he
could
eat
under
these
circumstance
dick
grant
s
reaction
be
not
surprising
he
turn
down
the
automatic
transmission
and
the
hundred
dollar
cost
that
go
with
it
as
something
that
a
buick
buyer
could
very
well
do
without
but
say
he
if
i
could
have
a
ride
like
you
ve
show
us
for
a
matter
of
fifteen

somehow
dutch
bower
chief
engineer
at
buick
have
already
put
in
his
claim
for
the
new
front
suspension
and
the
oldsmobile
and
pontiac
engineer
also
seem
determine
that
they
would
show
it
in
new
york
next
november
then
finally
bill
knudsen
the
general
manager
of
chevrolet
declare
in
word
of
one
syllable
that
chevrolet
be
not
go
to
be
left
out
o
e
hunt
try
to
persuade
him
that
there
be
not
enough
centerless
grind
machine
available
in
the
united
state
to
grind
the
wire
for
the
coil
spring
for
chevrolet
but
knudsen
be
adamant
say
that
the
machine
tool
industry
have
be
in
a
bad
way
for
year
but
they
be
go
to
be
busy
for
the
next
year
at
least
and
chevrolet
actually
make
the
new
york
show
in
november
with
their
model
on
the
dubonnet
suspension
pontiac
also
inherit
this
suspension
from
chevrolet
while
the
three
other
division
adopt
the
wishbone
suspension
this
meeting
stay
in
my
mind
because
it
be
such
a
tremendous
demonstration
of
american
enterprise
in
action
in
the
face
of
the
condition
then
exist
the
million
of
expenditure
to
which
the
corporation
be
commit
itself
argue
a
type
of
courage
which
be
new
in
my
experience
i
still
remember
ket
s
statement
it
seem
to
me
we
can
t
afford
not
to
do
it
we
thus
introduce
simultaneously
two
different
type
of
independent
front
wheel
suspension
however
after
some
far
improvement
on
the
wishbone
type
it
become
apparent
that
it
be
cheaper
and
easy
to
manufacture
and
more
trouble
free
in
operation
and
soon
all
our
line
of
car
adopt
it
duco
one
of
the
strike
scene
of
america
today
view
from
the
air
in
the
daytime
be
the
splash
of
jewel
like
color
present
by
every
parking
lot
the
color
be
of
an
enormous
variety
and
the
finish
be
nearly
indestructible
all
this
be
in
contrast
to
the
appearance
of
automobile
in
the
early
twenty
when
ford
dodge
overland
and
general
motor
be
use
only
black
enamel
on
high
volume
job
the
external
finish
be
then
a
subject
of
general
complaint
the
practice
of
the
carriage
industry
have
be
carry
over
into
automobile
manufacturing
without
much
change
automobile
for
the
first
twenty
five
year
of
their
existence
wore
carriage
paint
and
varnish
the
customer
could
not
understand
why
the
finish
of
a
carriage
last
for
a
long
time
while
when
he
bought
a
car
the
paint
would
sometimes
soon
peel
off
the
fact
of
course
be
that
the
carriage
and
the
motorcar
be
very
different
mechanism
the
automobile
be
subject
to
much
harder
service
it
be
use
in
more
kind
of
weather
and
the
heat
of
the
engine
produce
temperature
change
in
part
of
the
car
with
a
resultant
disastrous
effect
on
the
finish
we
dream
of
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
would
be
if
a
finish
could
be
developed
which
would
last
even
if
the
car
stood
out
in
all
kind
of
weather
we
also
begin
to
realize
that
a
good
fast
dry
finish
could
revolutionize
our
time
schedule
and
the
consequent
cost
of
production
the
finish
process
at
that
time
use
paint
and
varnish
be
slow
and
cumbersome
between
the
time
a
car
be
ready
to
be
finish
and
the
time
the
job
be
complete
something
like
two
to
four
week
go
by
depend
among
other
thing
on
the
temperature
and
humidity
it
can
readily
be
see
that
this
create
a
terrible
inventory
problem
for
a
while
many
automobile
manufacturer
shift
from
paint
and
varnish
to
oven
dry
enamel
in
an
effort
to
deal
with
some
of
these
problem
the
dodge
brother
open
car
for
example
be
wholly
oven
finish
with
no
paint
or
varnish
this
be
a
black
gilsonite
enamel
which
be
very
durable
however
oven
finish
be
only
a
transition
there
be
a
well
and
cheaper
answer
to
the
problem
on
july
more
by
accident
i
think
than
by
intention
a
chemical
reaction
be
note
in
one
of
the
du
pont
laboratory
which
lead
to
the
development
of
a
nitrocellulose
lacquer
eventually
call
duco
it
be
observe
that
a
lacquer
base
could
be
create
which
would
carry
more
color
pigment
in
suspension
and
produce
more
brilliant
color
three

in
there
be
still
many

to
be
solve
and
research
continued
in
the
du
pont
and
general
motor
research
laboratory
a
very
important
part
of
this
work
be
the
development
of
undercoat
for
duco
as
first
developed
be
not
very
adhesive
and
sometimes
strip
from
the

duco
also
require
the
use
of
natural
resin
which
be
limited
in
quantity
and
of
variable
quality
in

the

us
of

on
these
variable

always

both
in
the
paint

period
and
in
the

period
that
follow
it
but
it
be
expensive
and
the
range
be
limited

reduce
the

to
generalize
broadly
the
first
year
of
the
model
development
be
devote
to
lay
out
the
basic
engineering
and
style
characteristic
of
the
new
model
and
the
second
year
be
devote
mainly
to
the
engineering
problem
entail
in
bring
the
car
into
full
production
it
be
extremely
difficult
to
get
either
of
these
job
do
in
much
less
than
a
year
s
time
if
we
compress
the
time
give
to
set
the
basic
style
concept
we
increase
the
danger
of
lock
ourselves
in
with
a
product
which
will
not
meet
the
approval
of
the
retail
customer
and
if
we
compress
the
engineering
production
time
we
pay
extraordinary
overtime
charge
create
inventory
problem
and
possibly
delay
the
time
when
we
can
start
production
which
in
turn
might
mean
delay
in
a
car
s
announcement
date
and
loss
of
sale
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
unwise
to
lengthen
the
time
take
to
produce
the
new
model
there
be
of
course
no
reason
in
principle
why
we
could
not
begin
to
plan
our
model
change
three
or
even
five
year
in
advance
and
in
fact
we
do
some
think
that
far
ahead
but
there
be
the
practical
difficulty
that
the
planner
be
then
remote
from
the
reality
of
the
market
place
in
which
their
work
will
be
test
even
the
two
year
period
usually
require
now
imposes
a
severe
strain
on
the
corporation
s
ability
to
gauge
the
market
correctly
the
problem
may
be
view
this
way
general
motor
like
other
automobile
company
be
oblige
to
invest
million
of
dollar
to
devise
new
product
which
cannot
however
be
sell
until
a
long
period
of
time
have
elapse
meanwhile
the
consumer
taste
income
and
spending
habit
may
all
have
change
radically
for
that
matter
we
cannot
even
be
certain
that
the
new
model
be
right
at
the
time
it
be
first
conceive
response
to
sketch
and
to
survey
question
be
often
undependable
it
be
an
axiom
of
marketing
research
that
automobile
customer
never
know
whether
they
like
the
product
well
enough
to
buy
it
until
they
can
actually
see
the
real
thing
but
by
the
time
we
have
a
product
to
show
them
we
be
necessarily
commit
to
sell
that
product
because
of
the
tremendous
investment
involve
in
bring
it
to
market
every
automobile
manufacturer
have
on
occasion
be
caught
off
base
by
the
consumer
nevertheless
in
the
nature
of
thing
we
must
plan
and
coordinate
our
effort
in
order
to
get
to
market
with
a
new
model
this
very
special
kind
of
coordination
have
evolve
out
of
the
planning
experience
of
many
year
i
have
described
the
near
disaster
that
general
motor
experienced
in
because
there
be
no
establish
coordination
procedure
which
would
enable
the
several
distinct
management
group
to
work
together
on
a
new
model
program
after
that
experience
we
gradually
put
system
and
method
into
the
introduction
of
the
corporation
s
model
in
we
set
down
on
paper
for
the
first
time
i
believe
a
procedure
govern
the
production
of
new
model
it
be
a
manual
design
to
provide
a
definite
and
orderly
method
for
submit
the
essential
data
require
in
order
that
the
economic
financial
engineering
and
commercial
position
of
propose
new
product
may
be
evaluate
and
second
that
their
progress
from
the
time
of
approval
to
production
may
be
establish
for
the
information
of
all
concerned
the
product
approval
procedure
be
substantially
revise
in
and
to
some
extent
be
continually
change
it
should
be
emphasize
that
these
write
procedure
be
not
an
exact
timetable
to
which
our
model
run
must
conform
in
state
that
the
model
development
period
average
perhaps
two
year
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
we
start
each
model
from
scratch
at
the
begin
of
this
period
the
style
staff
for
example
be
continually
experiment
with
new
design
for
distant
future
model
and
at
any
point
in
time
there
be
sure
to
be
a
sizable
backlog
of
new
style
idea
at
our
disposal
some
of
them
quite
conventional
some
revolutionary
and
each
car
division
be
continually
engineering
a
variety
of
new
feature
mainly
for
the
chassis
some
of
these
feature
may
have
be
take
over
from
the
research
laboratory
and
the
engineering
staff
or
perhaps
from
the
accessory
division
and
refine
in
the
car
division
to
the
point
at
which
it
seem
feasible
to
introduce
them
into
production
model
others
may
have
be
developed
entirely
within
the
car
division
own
engineering
shop
and
laboratory
usually
the
first
formal
meeting
on
a
new
model
be
precede
by
many
informal
discussion
for
example
the
car
division
management
and
the
style
staff
review
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
past
production
program
they
examine
customer
research
report
and
market
analysis
and
discus
the
general
package
size
and
style
concept
for
the
new
car
to
be
design
some
of
these
issue
may
be
take
up
with
the
central
office
engineering
staff
and
with
fisher
body
division
as
well
as
with
the
chief
officer
of
the
corporation
even
though
some
important
work
on
future
model
be
always
go
on
in
the
corporation
most
of
us
have
come
to
think
of
each
new
model
program
as
begin
with
a
meeting
call
by
the
engineering
policy
group
the
reader
will
recall
that
this
group
report
directly
to
the
executive
committee
and
include
the
corporation
s
chairman
president
and
the
principal
central
office
executive
the
group
s
chairman
be
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
engineering
staff
since
the
group
concern
itself
with
broad
corporate
policy
the
membership
do
not
include
the
general
manager
of
the
car
division
or
fisher
body
although
these
men
and
the
chief
engineer
of
those
operation
be
often
invite
to
attend
the
group
s
meeting
for
a
review
of
the
program
in
which
they
be
involve
the
main
business
of
this
first
meeting
be
to
determine
the
outline
of
our
style
and
engineering
program
that
be
to
determine
the
car
general
appearance
and
size
characteristic
and
to
indicate
the
direction
of
far
style
and
divisional
development
the
desire
seat
width
head
and
leg
room
as
well
as
exterior
height
width
and
length
be
all
consider
the
style
staff
display
full
size
style
drawing
so
that
those
present
can
get
a
feel
about
the
appearance
size
and
roominess
characteristic
along
with
the
drawing
we
generally
show
full
size
dummy
seat
arrangement
commonly
refer
to
as
seat
buck
which
be
construct
to
simulate
the
propose
car
interior
this
buck
allows
us
to
check
entrance
room
condition
vision
roominess
and
seat
position
the
member
of
the
group
look
over
you
might
say
what
the
stylist
have
to
offer
in
line
with
the
idea
developed
at
this
kickoff
meeting
the
style
staff
progressively
develops
several
series
of
full
size
style
drawing
as
well
as
full
size
clay
model
and
seat
buck
for
each
kind
of
car
in
our
line
in
order
to
achieve
the
desire
objective
of
the
program
and
to
keep
abreast
of
tool
and
manufacturing
requirement
the
style
staff
must
work
closely
with
the
car
division
and
fisher
body
for
many
month
follow
this
first
meeting
in
general
it
be
the
style
staff
s
responsibility
to
set
the
basic
appearance
of
each
kind
of
car
that
be
the
staff
work
out
the
basic
appearance
of
the
general
motor
sedan
coupe
hardtop
station
wagon
and
convertible
and
usually
the
work
be
do
in
that
order
each
division
have
its
own
studio
within
the
style
staff
and
these
studio
be
responsible
for
give
each
car
line
its
own
distinctive
feature
for
example
the
feature
which
distinguish
the
chevrolet
and
the
pontiac
line
during
these
first
few
month
of
the
program
the
various
clay
model
be
change
and
refine
continually
and
at
each
stage
the
seat
arrangement
be
modify
in
line
with
the
style
suggest
by
the
clay
model
many
of
these
change
be
work
out
with
the
help
of
sketch
and
small
scale
clay
model
which
be
developed
by
style
in
an
attempt
to
experiment
with
newer
and
more
attractive
concept
meanwhile
the
engineering
department
of
the
car
division
and
of
fisher
body
have
be
work
continually
with
the
style
staff
in
order
to
reach
an
agreement
on
the
chassis
dimension
that
be
on
the
wheel
base
ground
clearance
tread
and
the
space
require
for
the
engine
and
drive
mechanism
an
agreement
on
these
fundamental
be
necessary
to
permit
the
style
staff
to
firm
up
its
concept
of
the
new
model
about
two
month
after
the
first
meeting
the
style
staff
offer
the
engineering
policy
group
a
fairly
advanced
style
proposal
present
with
a
full
size
clay
model
and
seat
buck
for
the
sedan
this
proposal
will
have
already
be
approve
by
the
interested
car
division
and
by
fisher
body
at
subsequent
engineering
policy
group
meeting
which
be
held
at
least
once
a
month
proposal
for
the
other
body
type
be
show
this
do
not
result
in
a
prescribed
order
of
approval
however
in
the
ensue
period
of
review
and
change
which
may
last
for
four
or
five
month
it
be
quite
possible
that
the
coupe
style
for
example
may
receive
general
acceptance
ahead
of
the
sedan
style
however
at
least
eighteen
month
before
the
start
of
production
the
engineering
policy
group
should
approve
the
sedan
clay
model
in
order
that
style
can
begin
to
release
drawing
to
fisher
body
when
the
clay
model
be
approve
style
build
an
inexpensive
plastic
model
of
the
exterior
the
plastic
model
be
useful
in
check
the
style
concept
inevitably
the
clay
model
look
bulkier
than
the
car
would
actually
be
but
the
plastic
model
can
be
paint
to
give
the
same
light
reflection
as
a
finish
car
and
indeed
with
glass
and
simulated
chrome
trim
its
exterior
be
almost
identical
with
the
finish
product
about
eighteen
month
before
production
begin
it
be
possible
to
make
some
calculation
about
the
cost
of
the
model
the
size
and
estimate
weight
of
the
car
be
know
by
then
and
fisher
body
have
begin
to
develop
information
on
production
engineering
cost
that
be
the
cost
of
the
dy
jig
fixture
and
so
forth
it
be
generally
fisher
s
practice
to
begin
estimate
these
cost
even
before
the
clay
model
be
approve
by
the
engineering
policy
group
at
this
stage
it
becomes
possible
to
weigh
the
sale
appeal
of
certain
feature
against
their
cost
and
to
modify
the
design
if
necessary
in
recent
year
tool
cost
have
be
lower
somewhat
by
general
motor
ability
in
some
case
to
utilize
certain
structural
feature
and
inner
panel
that
be
common
to
several
different
body
when
the
engineering
policy
group
fisher
body
and
the
car
division
approve
the
clay
and
initial
plastic
model
often
with
some
modification
the
style
staff
set
to
work
building
new
much
more
elaborate
plastic
model
which
be
identical
inside
and
out
with
the
model
that
will
come
off
the
production
line
these
reinforce
plastic
model
be
first
use
in
an
effort
to
build
motorama
show
car
and
other
experimental
car
quickly
and
economically
later
we
begin
to
use
these
plastic
model
just
to
give
ourselves
a
last
look
at
the
car
we
be
put
into
production
until
reinforce
plastic
be
developed
we
have
to
make
wood
and
metal
style
model
for
this
purpose
and
it
take
as
much
as
twelve
to
fourteen
week
to
make
one
of
them
the
reinforce
plastic
model
can
be
built
in
four
or
five
week
which
give
us
more
time
to
make
tool
and
dy
in
the
next
six
month
or
so
the
problem
of
coordinate
work
in
the
new
model
becomes
very
complex
while
the
final
plastic
model
be
be
built
the
style
staff
sends
drawing
of
major
sheet
metal
surface
and
of
such
detail
as
door
handle
and
mold
section
to
the
car
division
and
fisher
body
as
it
get
this
information
fisher
body
move
ahead
as
rapidly
as
possible
on
the
design
of
production
tool
begin
with
the
large
and
complex
component
for
example
the
cowl
door
panel
floor
roof
and
go
on
from
there
to
the
small
and
simpler
part
about
twelve
month
before
production
begin
the
engineering
policy
group
must
give
its
final
approval
to
the
design
show
on
the
final
reinforce
plastic
model
fisher
body
can
then
finalize
design
for
the

these

the

be
make
at

they
have
be
if
all
have
go
well
the

the

have
review
the

presumably
the

will
have
be
approve
from
here
on
any
substantial
change
in
the

will
involve
expensive
rework
of

a
variety
of
additional
tool
cost
and
also
a
serious
loss
of

which
could
mean
excessive
preparation
and
production
expense
sometimes
however
these
change
be
unavoidable
because
review
after
the

still
uncover
serious

the

compare
them
with
the

it
be
entirely
possible
that
some

continued
to
look
good
in

may
now
require
correction
and
while
change
at
this
stage
be
expensive
they
may
be
less
expensive
than
the
lose
sale
result
from
an
unappealing

on
more
than
one
occasion
we
have
have
to
choose
one
of
these
drastic
alternative
where
in
sum
do
we
stand
at
this
point
one
year
after

have
begin
one

the

so
forth
so
that
it

at
the

along
with
the

plant
engineering
department
determine
how
the
production
line
be
to
be
set
up
what
new
machinery
and
equipment
will
be
require
and
where
it
will
be
place
and
what
plant
rearrangement
will
be
necessary
by
this
time
too
the
actual
production
engineering
be
well
under
way
among
our
outside
supplier
as
well
as
inside
the
corporation
as
soon
as
we
have
finally
approve
the
new
model
we
consult
with
our
many
supplier
of
wheel
frame
rubber
product
and
so
forth
in
order
to
facilitate
their
engineering
and
development
work
and
to
help
them
plan
their
production
some
seven
to
eight
month
before
the
new
model
be
to
go
on
sale
fisher
body
will
have
complete
the
first
prototype
body
incorporate
many
hand
built
part
we
can
now
put
complete
prototype
car
together
for
test
we
generally
build
a
number
of
body
for
each
model
on
a
pilot
line
at
fisher
body
about
three
month
before
production
these
body
be
built
from
production
dy
so
the
pilot
line
provide
a
test
of
body
production
dy
and
tool
and
an
opportunity
to
train
production
supervisor
many
of
these
pilot
line
body
be
mount
on
the
prototype
chassis
and
use
for
additional
test
at
the
prove
ground
and
in
the
engineering
department
of
the
division
finally
the
car
that
come
off
the
pilot
line
can
be
use
by
the
sale
and
advertising
section
for
promotional
purpose
for
example
for
advance
showing
to
our
dealer
the
production
run
itself
be
not
start
until
about
six
week
before
the
new
car
go
on
sale
on
the
day
the
car
be
formally
introduce
to
the
public
our
plant
be
of
course
rapidly
attain
full
production
and
many
thousand
of
car
be
already
in
the
hand
of
dealer
the
new
model
program
be
over
and
we
be
ready
to
concentrate
more
fully
on
the
model
that
will
reach
the
dealer
one
and
two
year
hence
the
entire
new
model
program
thus
have
three
phase
style
dominates
the
first
year
of
the
program
engineering
design
be
continuous
almost
throughout
the
entire
two
year
period
with
work
end
just
before
mass
production
begin
equipment
and
tool
begin
before
style
completes
its
work
and
cover
the
multifarious
and
elaborate
procedure
require
actually
to
make
a
car
the
key
point
perhaps
be
the
period
halfway
through
the
process
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
when
the
new
design
be
approve
and
we
lock
ourselves
in
by
begin
the
production
phase
this
be
the
way
our
procedure
call
for
new
model
to
be
produce
and
this
be
the
way
in
large
measure
they
be
in
fact
produce
however
no
sooner
do
we
blueprint
reality
than
we
begin
to
change
it
in
recent
year
the
competitive
situation
have
at
time
require
us
to
produce
a
new
model
in
somewhat
less
than
two
year
at
the
same
time
the
increase
pace
of
competition
have
force
general
motor
and
other
producer
to
speed
up
the
rate
of
development
of
new
design
and
engineering
feature
naturally
when
a
large
part
of
a
new
car
be
new
great
pressure
be
exert
on
the
process
of
design
and
the
preparation
for
production
we
be
continuously
involve
in
this
process
of
make
a
new
and
well
car
although
the
many
complex
step
over
the
long
period
between
the
conception
of
a
new
model
program
and
its
execution
be
costly
they
be
worthwhile
for
the
annual
model

be
part
of
the
very
nature
of
the
development
of
the

its
early

our

to
cut

that
our

to
incorporate
in

to
shorten
the

to
achieve
these
end
we
long
ago
differentiate
a

function
from
the

we
gather
together
a
research
staff
in
the
early

and
an
engineering

about
ten
year
later
today
we
have
in

follow
an
advanced
engineering
approach
and
produce
very
good
result
in
a
number
of
important
area
in
general
motor
until
he
retire
in
the
s
in
a
new
phase
in
general
motor
research
be
begin
with
the
appointment
of
the
eminent
nuclear
scientist
lawrence
r
hafstad
as
vice
president
of
research
dr
hafstad
s
training
of
course
be
not
as
an
automotive
engineer
he
have
never
be
associate
with
an
automobile
company
his
appointment
reflect
the
fact
that
the
emphasis
in
the
work
of
the
research
laboratory
be
move
steadily
in
the
direction
of
investigation
of
new
broad
research
problem
the
activity
of
the
research
laboratory
today
lie
mainly
in
three
kind
of
work
first
it
do
trouble
shoot
around
the
corporation
and
it
may
be
call
in
to
help
wherever
its
specialized
knowledge
be
need
for
example
in
the
elimination
of
gear
noise
in
the
test
of
casting
for
material
defect
or
in
the
reduction
of
vibration
second
it
make
engineering
improvement
of
a
creative
nature
grow
out
of
problem
solve
these
problem
range
from
improvement
in
transmission
fluid
paint
bearing
fuel
and
the
like
to
high
level
apply
research
such
as
the
work
on
combustion
high
compression
engine
refrigerant
diesel
engine
gas
turbine
free
piston
engine
aluminum
engine
metal
and
alloy
steel
air
pollution
and
the
like
and
third
it
encourages
some
intensified
basic
research
the
dramatic
accomplishment
of
science
in
recent
year
have
capture
the
imagination
of
everyone
and
have
cause
industry
as
a
whole
to
move
into
a
research
era
the
word
research
be
use
in
industry
in
a
number
of
different
way
to
denote
scientific
discovery
or
advanced
engineering
or
even
traditional
and
routine
product
improvement
the
last
be
clearly
an
abuse
of
the
term
research
have
always
be
difficult
to
define
in
a
way
that
distinguishes
the
more
basic
or
fundamental
type
from
apply
research
there
be
no
commonly
agree
hard
and
fast
line
as
to
how
basic
a
thing
have
to
be
objectively
to
be
call
basic
research
the
definition
upon
which
there
seem
to
be
wide
agreement
be
that
basic
research
be
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
in
this
sense
we
in
this
country
be
not
do
nearly
enough
the
solution
to
this
problem
lie
mainly
in
the
university
and
in
government
activity
but
in
recent
year
the
question
have
arisen
of
the
role
of
private
industry
obviously
the
major
portion
of
the
work
must
be
undertaken
in
the
university
they
have
the
academic
viewpoint
the
purpose
the
tradition
the
atmosphere
and
the
talent
for
seek
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
my
personal
viewpoint
be
express
in
the
alfred
p
sloan
foundation
which
support
a
program
of
basic
research
in
the
physical
science
in
the
university
that
this
research
be
basic
be
indicate
by
the
fact
that
the
foundation
bet
not
on
the
project
but
on
the
talent
of
the
individual
who
selects
his
own
research
in
accordance
with
his
individual
interest
desire
and
ability
obviously
too
basic
research
that
require
unique
and
expensive
facility
beyond
the
resource
of
university
be
properly
the
province
of
government
establishment
such
as
the
bureau
of
standard
and
the
more
recent
atomic
energy
commission
and
the
national
aeronautics
and
space
administration
as
to
the
participation
of
industry
in
basic
research
the
question
have
two
part
research
inside
the
industrial
organization
and
that
do
outside
the
organization
but
finance
by
it
i
think
first
of
all
that
since
the
outcome
of
basic
research
be
the
foundation
of
the
knowledge
use
in
industry
it
be
appropriate
and
an
expression
of
enlighten
self
interest
for
industry
to
make
outside
grant
to
university
for
basic
research
in
other
word
industry
should
do
this
because
in
the
long
run
it
will
help
industry
i
think
that
shareholder
and
management
will
agree
in
principle
with
my
position
on
this
the
extent
to
which
industry
should
engage
in
basic
research
inside
its
own
border
be
a
complex
and
somewhat
unsettled
problem
i
cannot
see
how
industry
in
its
own
work
can
properly
distract
its
attention
in
a
large
way
from
its
own
practical
project
from
the
standpoint
that
basic
research
be
the
seek
of
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
it
be
apparent
that
it
do
not
belong
in
a
primary
sense
in
industry
it
do
not
follow
however
that
industry
should
not
engage
at
all
in
basic
research
to
a
certain
extent
i
think
it
should
a
compromise
be
necessary
the
scientist
seek
knowledge
primarily
for
its
own
sake
industry
seek
knowledge
for
eventual
application
it
be
however
reasonable
for
industry
to
engage
in
basic
research
in
specify
area
where
any
advance
in
knowledge
however
speculative
be
likely
to
be
of
eventual
use
to
the
industry
a
kind
of
scientific
reconnaissance
in
other
word
industry
might
legitimately
employ
scientist
to
work
on
basic
research
within
the
industry
in
area
where
the
scientist
field
of
interest
coincide
with
those
of
the
industry
even
though
the
motivation
of
each
be
different
for
example
a
scientist
might
say
my
chief
interest
be
the
relation
of
the
property
of
individual
metal
to
the
property
of
alloy
i
don
t
care
of
what
use
this
be
i
want
to
know
why
it
be
a
producer
of
alloy
could
hardly
help
but
be
interested
in
the
result
of
the
research
so
long
as
the
motif
of
the
scientist
and
the
industry
be
not
prejudice
it
be
reasonable
for
them
to
establish
a
work
relationship
the
compromise
lie
not
in
motivation
but
in
the
overlap
objective
field
of
interest
the
scientist
s
basic
research
may
be
the
industry
s
exploratory
research
this
be
the
kind
of
basic
research
i
think
industry
be
justified
in
engage
in
since
there
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
an
application
regardless
of
the
scientist
s
disinterested
motive
to
avoid
any
possible
limitation
on
research
activity
we
need
side
by
side
both
the
industrial
and
the
academic
approach
in
sum
therefore
my
argument
be
this
that
basic
research
define
as
the
search
for
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
belongs
primarily
in
the
university
that
industry
should
give
support
to
basic
research
in
university
and
that
industry
have
a
special
interest
in
engage
in
several
type
of
basic
research
inside
of
industry
where
there
be
a
common
broad
area
of
subject
matter
useful
result
come
more
quickly
from
basic
research
than
heretofore
and
so
a
basic
research
group
inside
industry
becomes
a
valuable
intelligence
group
in
the
physical
science
and
the
presence
of
scientist
well
know
for
their
work
in
basic
science
help
morale
and
the
prestige
of
the
industrial
laboratory
and
of
the
enterprise
itself
the
engineering
staff
the
engineering
staff
provide
an
intermediate
medium
range
link
between
the
research
laboratory
and
divisional
engineering
activity
it
chiefly
develops
new
engineering
concept
and
design
and
appraises
them
for
commercial
application
we
do
not
have
a
department
or
section
of
the
corporation
under
the
title
engineering
staff
until
but
the
various
person
and
function
that
be
brought
together
to
make
up
this
staff
already
exist
some
of
them
go
back
to
the
early
twenty
when
for
example
mr
hunt
and
mr
crane
work
up
the
new
pontiac
car
in
the
chevrolet
division
in
and
that
be
a
specie
of
improvised
staff
operation
for
a
special
purpose
the
general
technical
committee
form
in
be
another
step
toward
an
engineering
staff
concept
our
division
then
differ
greatly
in
their
engineering
practice
and
in
the
quality
of
their
engineering
work
some
of
our
product
be
well
design
others
be
not
i
have
described
the
lack
then
of
any
extensive
interchange
of
information
among
the
division
or
any
mean
which
insured
that
this
would
take
place
and
how
the
general
technical
committee
unite
research
divisional
engineer
and
general
executive
be
make
to
serve
this
purpose
the
general
technical
committee
grow
as
it
do
out
of
our
experience
with
the
copper
cool
engine
be
the
begin
of
all
engineering
coordination
in
general
motor
from
this
committee
come
the
corporation
s
first
regular
test
program
car
then
be
be
test
on
public
road
and
there
be
no
easy
way
of
tell
whether
the
test
driver
have
pull
up
at
the
side
of
a
road
take
a
nap
and
then
driven
faster
than
the
test
schedule
call
for
to
make
up
the
necessary
mileage
once
one
of
our
engineer
discover
a
test
car
jacked
up
outside
a
dance
hall
with
the
engine
run
up
the
require
mileage
on
the
odometer
the
most
important
step
we
take
to
standardize
and
improve
test
procedure
be
the
establishment
in
of
the
general
motor
prove
ground
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
automobile
industry
the
thought
be
that
we
would
have
a
large
area
properly
protect
and
entirely
close
to
the
public
it
would
be
provide
with
road
of
various
type
represent
all
the
various
demand
on
the
motorcar
from
the
standpoint
of
high
speed
hill
of
various
grade
smooth
road
rough
road
ability
of
a
car
to
move
through
water
which
be
frequently
require
in
severe
storm
and
the
like
there
we
would
be
able
to
prove
out
our
car
under
control
condition
both
before
and
after
production
and
we
could
also
make
comprehensive
test
on
competitive
car
the
idea
be
approve
and
the
necessary
capital
make
available
the
next
problem
be
to
find
out
where
such
a
prove
ground
could
be
locate
what
we
want
be
a
varied
terrain
centrally
situate
with
relation
to
our
manufacturing
operation
in
lansing
flint
pontiac
and
detroit
michigan
be
rather
flat
and
at
first
we
have
difficulty
locate
an
area
of
sufficient
size
that
would
give
us
all
the
various
grade
we
need
however
almost
every
foot
of
the
united
state
have
be
measure
topographically
and
the
record
be
available
in
washington
we
go
to
washington
and
from
the
geological
survey
map
available
there
we
determine
a
location
that
appear
to
fulfill
our
need
then
the
general
executive
and
engineer
of
the
various
division
and
myself
spent
a
day
at
the
prospective
site
we
walk
all
over
the
place
ate
a
picnic
lunch
under
the
tree
and
finally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
particular
area
of
acre
now
acre
at
milford
michigan
would
meet
the
requirement
we
have
in
mind
i
delegate
one
of
my
executive
assistant
w
j
davidson
to
take
responsibility
for
develop
the
prove
ground
and
he
appoint
f
m
holden
as
the
first
resident
manager
not
long
afterward
mr
holden
go
to
oakland
at
his
own
request
and
be
succeed
at
the
prove
ground
by
o
t
pop
kreusser
all
three
of
these
men
contribute
greatly
to
the
success
of
this
project
the
land
be
survey
the
straightaway
be
laid
out
so
that
we
could
check
the
effect
of
different
wind
on
speed
a
track
be
built
and
bank
so
that
it
be
reasonably
safe
to
operate
car
at
speed
up
to
mile
an
hour
or
more
engineering
building
be
erect
so
that
indoor
test
could
be
make
in
correlation
with
outdoor
test
headquarters
and
facility
be
provide
for
the
corporation
s
engineer
separate
engineering
headquarters
and
garage
facility
be
eventually
provide
for
the
staff
of
the
engineering
department
of
the
various
division
so
that
they
could
preserve
their
divisional
autonomy
in
test
chevrolet
for
example
could
do
its
own
test
if
desire
in
addition
to
that
be
do
by
the
corporation
a
clubhouse
be
erect
that
provide
sleep
quarter
din
facility
and
the
like
for
those
attach
to
the
prove
ground
operation
since
the
prove
ground
itself
be
a
considerable
number
of
mile
from
any
town
where
commissary
facility
be
available
in
those
day
i
use
to
spend
a
day
and
a
night
sometimes
longer
at
the
prove
ground
every
other
week
i
would
go
over
the
engineering
of
general
motor
car
and
competitive
car
i
would
examine
what
be
be
do
in
the
way
of
test
future
product
the
prove
ground
thus
afford
my
associate
and
myself
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
find
out
what
be
go
on
in
the
automobile
industry
from
the
engineering
point
of
view
to
the
original
prove
ground
we
have
since
add
a
special
desert
prove
ground
at
mesa
arizona
and
a
station
to
test
car
in
mountain
drive
and
a
garage

this
great

although
in

finance
by
its

the

operating
group
would
try
to
identify
the
major
direction
in
which
car
development
be
move
we
would
then
locate
a
capable
engineer
and
set
up
a
group
under
him
to
work
on
a
select
problem
we
set
up
the
first
product
study
group
in
to
adapt
the
chevrolet
for
the
use
of
vauxhall
in
england
this
group
also
design
car
for
opel
in
germany
and
other
small
car
afterward
we
set
up
the
suspension
product
study
group
and
the
transmission
product
study
group
in
the
cadillac

subsequently
involve
the

and
the
engine

the
buick
division
the

developed
the
fully

hydra
matic
transmission
for
passenger

for
large
commercial
vehicle
the
third
be
responsible
for
many
improvement
in
the
car
engine
as
time
pass
we
change
the
product
study
group
from
corporation
task
force
situate
physically
within
the
operating
division
into
permanent
separate

in
four
vital

power
development
transmission
development
structure
and
suspension
development
and
the
design
of
new
type
of
car
eventually
we
take
them
out
of
the
division
and
brought
them
together
in
the
engineering
staff
and
call
them
development
group
they
form
the
heart
of
the
engineering
staff
today
the
engineering
staff
be
closely
link
to
the
engineering
policy
group
through
the
vice
president
of

who
directs
the
engineering
staff
and
be
chairman
of
the

group
since
this
group
review
the
major
step
in
the
development
of
new
model
and
major
departure
from
current
engineering
practice
it
be
in
close
touch
with
the
engineering
work
of
the
operating

of
the

thereby
make
a

they
make
a
direct
impact
on
the

of
the

the
present
organization
i
believe
ensures
the
most
rapid
discovery
of
new

and
their
translation
into
current

the

our
overall
engineering
work
may
logically
be
view
as
fall
into
two
area
one
center
on
the

and
the
other
on
the
process
of

with
conjectural
experimental

when
these

prove
successful

they

with
the

to

industrial
photography
production
control
and

center
these
activity
in
a
single
corporate
staff
be
the
idea
of
one
of
our
executive
b
d
kunkle
who
in
felt
that
there
be
need
for
the
same
kind
of
function
in
the
manufacturing
area
that
the
product

group
fulfil
in
the

development
area
the
manufacture
of
automobile
have
rapidly
become
a
more
and
more
involve
process
require
a
constant
study
of
new
material
new
machinery
and
new
method
hence
the
idea
of
specialist
to
develop
idea
for
use
in
the
manufacturing
process
logically
this
be
a
staff
function
and
as
such
could
be
well
fulfil
by
a
corporation
group
than
by
the
individual
division
the
technical
work
of
the
manufacturing
staff
be
largely
center
in
the
process
engineering
activity
of
its
manufacturing

section
where
the
problem
of
automation
arises
process

necessarily
include
automatic
operation
beyond
the
semiautomatic
and
automatic
machine
loom
the
image
of
the
semiautomatic
and
automatic
factory
the
whole
vague
area
sum
up
under
the
term
automation
in
which
it
be
often
difficult
to
distinguish
science
fiction
from
practical
manufacturing
possibility
the
manufacturing
staff
will
play
a
large
role
in
this
field
in
general
motor
how
far
automation
should
go
be
a
difficult
question
which
will
have
to
be
decide
on
the
high
policy
level
of
the
corporation
general
motor
and
the
manufacturing
staff
have
tend
to
be
somewhat
more
cautious
in
this
area
than
some
other
manufacturer
there
exists
a
widespread
belief
that
if
it
s
automatic
it
must
be
good
but
our
experience
show
that
this
be
not
always
the
case
a
good
balance
view
on
this
subject
be
give
in
a
paper
present
before
general
motor
conference
for
engineering
and
science
educator
by
robert
m
critchfield
who
be
then
in
charge
of
process
development
he
say
in
recent
year
we
ve
all
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
automation
it
seem
to
me
that
most
of
this
talk
have
do
little
more
than
confuse
a
great
many
people
include
a
few
in
the
engineering
profession
as
to
the
true
implication
of
the
word
as
you
know
automation
be
nothing
new
it
s
merely
a
relatively
recent
word
for
a
process
that
have
be
go
on
in
manufacturing
for
more
than
half
a
century
perhaps
even
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
eli
whitney
s
successful
attempt
to
mass
produce
musket
for
the
continental
army
i
can
recall
that
we
have
some
type
of
transfer
machine
and
other
automatic
production
device
year
ago
in
general
motor
which
be
long
before
the
word
automation
be
coin
our
misconception
seem
to
stem
from
the
fact
that
the
literature
overflow
with
too
many
notion
that
automation
be
the
obvious
solution
to
the
mass
production
of
a
particular
part
or
product
involve
a
number
of
highly
repetitive
hand
operation
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
truth
the
decision
to
mechanize
or
not
to
mechanize
a
production
process
or
operation
involves
much
more
than
the
number
of
repetitive
operation
it
involves
a
good
many
fundamental
of
economics
by
economic
solution
we
mean
the
solution
to
the
problem
which
will
provide
the
best
return
on
our
capital
investment
and
of
course
produce
the
product
accord
to
specification
and
of
the
desire

and
the
expression
the
most
effective
use
of
the
manual
and
mechanical
element
be
meant
to
convey
that
hand
operation
do
not
necessarily
disappear
entirely
when
a
process
or
an
operation

while
the
completely

an

there
continue
to
be
a

there
be
no

that

a
distinctive
domed
auditorium
in
which
fairly
sizable
group
can
gather
for
showing
of
the
staff
s
work
altogether
the

now
have
twenty

west
help
to
seal
the
center
from
other
real
estate
development
and
preserve
its
distinctive
rather
campus
like
atmosphere
but
of
course
the
primary
function
of
the
technical
center
as
of
all
general
motor
facility
be
to
get
work
do
and
perhaps
its
real
greatness
resides
in
the
fact
that
it
be
wonderfully
functional
as
well
as
elegant
to
understand
why
it
have
be
a
valuable
investment
for
the
corporation
easily
worth
the
million
that
have
be
put
into
it
the
reader
should
know
something
of
its
origin
the
inadequacy
of
our
previous
facility
be
obvious
even
before
the
end
of
world
war
ii
our
different
staff
operation
be
then
scatter
all
over
the
detroit
area
in
a
wide
variety
of
rather
makeshift
quarter
i
be
especially
struck
by
the
unhappy
situation
of
the
style
staff
whose
fabricate
shop
be
locate
in
an
old
fisher
body
building
several
mile
from
the
staff
headquarters
this
building
be
adjacent
to
some
heavy
engineering
work
we
be
do
especially
on
diesel
engine
and
mr
earl
s
men
be
oppress
by
the
noise
in
any
case
they
do
not
have
enough
room
during
the
war
the
different
staff
begin
to
formulate
plan
for
their
facility
in
the
postwar
era
from
a
consideration
of
this
problem
in
relation
to
research
and
engineering
there
begin
to
emerge
the
idea
of
set
aside
and
develop
one
area
for
all
the
technical
staff
this
imply
some
organizational
change
of
course
i
discuss
these
change
and
first
propose
something
like
a
new
staff
center
in
a
letter
to
mr
kettering
date
march
my
dear
ket
i
have
be
think
about
certain
corporation
problem
as
affect
the
long
term
position
of
our
affair
and
i
would
like
to
ask
your
point
of
view
if
i
may
on
one
of
these
problem
as
i
see
it
i
be
not
go
to
present
an
argument
to
you
as
to
the
importance
of
technological
progress
we
both
recognize
that
as
the
keystone
of
our
future
position
in
our
research
activity
down
through
the
year
we
have
a
marvelous
balance
between
the
scientific
side
and
the
engineering
side
what
i
m
wonder
about
be
whether
this
marvelous
balance
that
we
have
can
and
will
be
maintain
if
i
be
to
venture
an
opinion
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
ten
to
twenty
year
from
now
general
motor
research
would
be
much
more
in
the
scientific
area
than
it
be
now
by
the
scientific
area
i
mean
problem
that
be
related
directly
to
our
area
of
interest
or
perhaps
indirectly
but
not
in
any
sense
of
the
word
what
we
normally
term
engineering
in
character
now
i
have
in
mind
the
point
that
you
have
always
raise
with
me
in
which
i
have
agree
viz
the
difficulty
involve
and
the
importance
of
shorten
the
time
when
research
development
be
incorporate
in
an
engineering
sense
in
our
product
in
an
attempt
to
accelerate
engineering
progress
in
our
product
down
through
the
year
i
have
try
several
different
approach
first
to
charge
the
engineering
department
of
the
division
with
the
development
of
a
certain
forward
device
like
the
synchro
mesh
transmission
for
instance
subsequent
to
that
we
have
as
you
know
set
up
product
study
group
under
the
direction
of
the
general
head
of
the
engineering
staff
in
that
way
we
can
carry
our
engineering
development
to
the
point
of
its
practicability
after
which
it
can
be
dealt
with
in
an
engineering
or
production
way
as
circumstance
may
justify
i
believe
we
should
set
up
in
the
corporation
in
the
staff
of
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
engineering
a
properly
accredit
central
engineering
activity
to
deal
with
the
car
as
a
whole
i
would
visualize
the
physical
development
of
this
activity
to
consist
of
a
set
up
close
to
but
outside
the
city
of
detroit
the
prove
ground
be
probably
too
far
away
for
contact
i
believe
that
such
a
set
up
would
serve
to
reduce
the
time
element
in
bring
into
our
product
advanced
research
work
locate
at
milford
michigan
forty
two
mile
northwest
of
detroit
nothing
need
be
do
here
to
in
any
way
change
the
combine
engineering
and
scientific
area
in
which
the
research
be
now
deal
and
if
in
future
year
the
trend
of
our
research
work
should
be
more
in
the
scientific
area
then
we
would
have
a
set
up
that
would
make
up
for
the
delinquency
mr
kettering
respond
to
this
suggestion
with
a
plan
for
expand
the
research
facility
and
move
all
of
them
except
the
machine
tool
and
model
shop
to
a
new
location
he
sent
this
proposal
to
o
e
hunt
who
forward
it
to
me
on
april
i
sent
mr
hunt
a
letter
make
these
point
among
others
first
i
think
we
all
agree
that
w
hatever
it
might
cost
would
be
inconsequential
compare
with
what
we
will
get
out
of
it
after
all
the
necessity
of
additional
facility
be
what
i
might
refer
to
as
an
end
necessity
we
can
only
sell
a
product
that
be
sound
desirable
and
advanced
technically
second
i
be
convince
that
we
need
additional
facility
for
research
and
that
the
present
facility
be
not
only
inadequate
but
poorly
locate
for
the
result
that
we
must
have
i
be
absolutely
against
spending
more
money
for
the
same
type
of
thing
where
we
be
therefore
i
believe
that
the
project
be
sound
and
desirable
so
far
as
establish
an
entirely
new
location
where
the
operating
condition
will
be
more
in
line
as
we
look
forward
into
tomorrow
i
conclude
the
letter
by
propose
an
amendment
to
mr
kettering
s
plan
and
suggest
let
s
set
up
what
we
would
call
general
motor
technical
center
the
center
to
which
i
have
refer
would
comprise
an
expand
research
activity
as
define
by
mr
kettering
and
engineering
activity
which
would
comprise
harley
earl
s
body
design
cor
r
elate
with
the
broaden
product
activity
such
as
we
be
now
conduct
in
detroit
by
the
end
of
this
proposal
have
advanced
to
the
point
where
i
felt
able
to
take
it
to
the
administration
committee
for
discussion
and
approval
i
quote
from
the
minute
of
the
meeting
of
that
committee
for
december
mr
sloan
advise
the
group
that
plan
be
be
formulate
to
establish
in
the
vicinity
of
detroit
a
technical
center
in
line
with
the
corporation
s
policy
of
improve
its
technological
position
he
state
that
the
plan
be
in
a
tentative
stage
and
complete
data
will
be
submit
at
a
later
date
it
be
propose
that
the
center
shall
house
the
present
activity
carry
on
by
the
research
division
and
the
art
and
color
section
and
also
provide
facility
for
engineering
research
of
a
character
comparable
to
present
product
study
carry
on
by
the
central
office
engineering
staff
that
be
neither
research
activity
presently
carry
on
by
the
research
division
nor
the
individual
engineering
work
carry
on
by
the
various
divisional
engineering
group
in
response
to
an
inquiry
from
the
chairman
those
present
express
themselves
as
be
enthusiastically
in
favor
of
the
propose
technical
center
there
remain
the
sizable
question
of
where
the
center
should
be
situate
after
some
discussion
it
be
agree
that
the
center
should
be
outside
of
highly
congest
area
near
a
railroad
twenty
five
to
thirty
minute
from
the
general
motor
building
and
adjacent
to
residential
area
it
be
also
agree
that
each
activity
should
retain
its
individual
identity
by
the
middle
of
december
a
suitable
section
of
land
meeting
the
various
requirement
have
be
locate
at
the
present
site
and
we
proceed
to
option
most
of
the
west
half
of
section
warren
township
northeast
of
detroit
all
concerned
agree
on
the
desirability
of
this
location
there
also
remain
a
question
about
the
architectural
and
aesthetic
standard
we
should
aim
at
harley
earl
have
contend
from
the
begin
that
we
should
engage
an
architect
of
stature
and
aim
for
a
center
that
would
be
distinctive
several
others
felt
that
any
emphasis
on
high
aesthetic
standard
might
be
detrimental
to
the
practical
operation
of
the
center
and
so
they
want
general
motor
itself
to
design
and
plan
the
project
at
about
the
time
this
argument
be
in
progress
i
happen
to
visit
the
ethyl
corporation
laboratory
in
detroit
which
have
just
be
complete
these
handsome
facility
make
an
excellent
impression
on
me
and
so
i
inclined
to
mr
earl
s
point
of
view
more
than
i
might
have
otherwise
among
those
who
express
some
concern
about
the
effect
of
an
aesthetically
orient
center
be
mr
lammot
du
pont
he
felt
quite
properly
that
he
would
not
be
fulfil
his
responsibility
as
a
director
unless
he
be
satisfied
on
certain
point
i
write
to
him
on
may
argue
the
advantage
of
retain
an
outside
architect
and
on
may
he
reply
that
he
be
satisfied
on
the
point
his
letter
say
in
part
the
whole
layout
and
the
description
of
its
preparation
give
me
the
impression
that
the
matter
of
esthetic
treatment
or
as
i
would
style
it
dress
up
the
place
have
be
an
important
factor
from
the
begin
i
question
whether
the
matter
of
appearance
be
of
any
importance
in
a
project
of
this
kind
the
sole
object
be
to
get
technical
result
it
be
with
this
thought
in
mind
that
in
offering
my
remark
i
start
out
with
the
layout
which
have
be
make
by
an
architectural
firm
whereas
accord
to
my
line
of
thought
it
would
have
be
more
appropriate
to
have
have
the
layout
make
by
an
engineering
firm
or
general
motor
engineer
i
gather
from
your
letter
that
it
be
not
the
intention
to
allow
the
appearance
to
interfere
with
the
technical
possibility
or
to
add
substantially
to
the
cost
of
the
project
with
those
two
assurance
my
only
remain
question
with
respect
to
the
project
would
be
answer
we
ask
mr
earl
himself
to
find
the
right
architect
for
the
center
he
visit
a
number
of
lead
architectural
school
and
sought
out
the
opinion
of
others
who
be
knowledgeable
in
the
field
and
he
found
in
the
end
that
virtually
everyone
make
the
same
recommendation
the
selection
of
the
saarinen
be
not
a
difficult
choice
by
july
we
have
the
architect
preliminary
plan
an
elaborate
scale
model
and
artist
rendering
of
various
building
on
july
we
announce
the
project
publicly
and
it
receive
wide
and
favorable
comment
in
the
press
by
october
the
property
have
be
rough
grade
and
entirely
fence
in
the
project
be
then
delayed
by
the
great
postwar
strike
run
from
the
fall
of
through
march
and
by
the
fact
that
in
the
boom
postwar
market
we
found
we
need
expand
production
facility
more
than
any
other
kind
of
building
even
the
technical
center
construction
be
resume
in
and
the
technical
center
open
formally
in
i
be
satisfied
that
the
decision
to
provide
this
aesthetically
distinctive
and
functional
center
for
our
technical
talent
be
a
sound
and
desirable
one
chapter
style
the
prominence
of
style
in
the
automobile
market
in
recent
year
be
the
outcome
of
the
evolution
of
the
annual

style
and
engineering
in
the

have
evolve
together
in
a
continuous
interaction
that
brought
about
the
modern

the

personality

to
the
point
of
unreasonable
insistence
on
have
his
idea
as
to
the

follow
to
the

of

and
characteristic
we
come
into
the
s
with
two
kind
of
engineer
one
in
product
and
the
other
in
production
in
a
certain
relation
of
tension

necessarily
affected

design
of
the

cause
him
to
want
to
hold
up

in
the
product
they
be
headache
to
him
but
by
the
mid
twenty
the
product
engineer
have
begin
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
sale
people
he
then
begin
to
yield
to
market
consideration
though
still
largely
in
term
of
purely
engineering
design
in
the
course
of
time
the
product
engineer
raise
the
state
of
his

so
high
that
he
produce
not
only
a
superb

also
a

far
as
the

by
take
for

the

engineering
excellence
of
all

so
his
shopping
be
strongly
influence
by
variation
in

not

pure

it
be

to

come
to
be
a
factor
in
the

and
woe
to
the
company
which
ignores
them
as
a
producer

be
in
harmony
with
this
trend
of
the
industry
and
of
consumer
desire

the
close
of

ii
we
make
the
projection
that
for
an
indefinite
period
the
principal
attraction
of
the

would
be
appearance
automatic
transmission

that
order
and
that
have
be
the
case

degree
to
which
style
change
should
be
make
in
any
one
model
run
present
a
particularly
delicate
problem
the
change
in
the
new
model
should
be
so
novel
and
attractive
as
to
create
demand
for
the
new
value
and
so
to
speak
create
a
certain
amount
of
dissatisfaction
with
past
model
as
compare
with
the
new
one
and
yet
the
current
and
old
model
must
still
be
capable
of
give
satisfaction
to
the
vast
use
car
market
each
line
of
general
motor
car
produce
should
preserve
a
distinction
of
appearance
so
that
one
know
on
sight
a
chevrolet
a
pontiac
an
oldsmobile
a
buick
or
a
cadillac
the

as

adapt
to
mass

in
the
early
automobile
in
the

there
be
a
certain
relationship
between
the
various
part
that
be
adhere
to
by
almost
every
car
maker
for
many
year
the

for
example
have
to
be
in

with
the

axle
and
the
rear
seat

to
be
directly
above
the
rear
axle
a
relationship
which
be
responsible
for
the
height
of
the
car
of
the
period
inevitably
these
fix
relationship
between
the
axle
and
the
body
of
the
old
car
meant
that
the
car
have
to
be
high
however
this
do
not
matter
much
during
the
period
when
the
industry
principally
be
building
open
car
that
be
until
the
mid
twenty
a
fairly
satisfactory
design
have
be
evolve
for
the
motorcar
when
it
be
an
open
car
in
when
percent
of
the
car
manufacture
be
tour
car
or
roadster
the
tour
car
have
a
clean
uncluttered
look
body
surface
be
smooth
door
be
flush
and
the
hood
have
be
raise
and
lengthen
until
it
be
the
most
prominent
feature
it
be
a
product
of
the
period
of
motorcar
history
when
the
car
be
use
mostly
for
sport
and
pleasure
rather
than
for
everyday
travel
and
business
the
main
problem
be
of
course
the
weather
for
twenty
year
we
protect
ourselves
with
a
variety
of
rubber
coat
hat
lap
robe
and
other
makeshift
thing
for
some
reason
or
other
it
take
us
a
long
time
to
realize
that
the
way
to
keep
dry
in
a
motorcar
be
to
keep
the
weather
out
of
the
car
with
the
close
car
come
style
as
we
know
it
today
the
general
motor
product
policy
program
of
emphasize
the
very
great
importance
of
style
in
sell
but
it
be
not
until
when
close
body
be
become
dominant
that
i
first
turn
to
the
problem
of
style
in
a
practical
way
the
appearance
of
the
close
car
at
that
time
left
much
to
be
desire
the
period
of
automobile
elegance
during
the
early
day
of
the
motorcar
when
car
be
in
effect
handmade
and
reflect
the
design
of
the
carriage
be
already
far
past
and
almost
forgotten
the
mature
open
car
be
all
but
obsolete
the
new
close
car
be
a
high
ungainly
contraption
with
narrow
door
and
a
belt
line
that
be
the
line
between
the
window
and
the
low
part
of
the
body
high
above
the
already
high
hood
general
motor
close
car
of
for
example
be
to
inch
or
more
high
as
compare
with
to
inch
in
and
since
the
body
do
not
overlap
the
frame
they
be
very
narrow
to
inch
in
compare
with
overall
width
of
about
inch
in
the
model
they
be
well
make
but
their
height
be
not
attractive
and
as
car
be
driven
more
rapidly
by
more
efficient
motor
it
become
dangerous
to
have
vehicle
with
their
center
of
gravity
so
far
above
the
ground
the
awkwardness
of
these
car
come
in
part
from
the
nature
of
the
design
process
there
be
then
generally
two
completely
separate
operation
one
for
the
production
of
the
car
body
and
the
other
for
the
production
of
the
chassis
include
some
of
the
part
of
the
car
that
contribute
to
its
appearance
in
general
motor
at
that
time
the
car
division
design
and
built
the
chassis
as
a
separate
unit
complete
with
cowl
fender
run
board
and
hood
fisher
body
then
design
and
built
a
body
with
door
window
seat
and
roof
which
also
be
assemble
separately
then
the
body
be
instal
on
the
chassis
the
final
appearance
of
the
car
reflect
the
independence
of
the
two
operation
i
express
my
general
view
about
the
need
to
develop
a
style
program
on
july
in
a
letter
to
h
h
bassett
general
manager
of
buick
my
dear
harry
for
the
first
cadillac
car
that
i
ever
have
i
purchase
small
wire
wheel
in
order
to
get
the
car
down
nearer
the
ground
and
i
never
could
see
why
as
motor
car
people
we
have
apparently
be
so
loath
to
do
a
thing
which
contribute
probably
more
to
the
appearance
of
the
car
from
the
attractive
standpoint
than
any
other
single
thing
chrysler
in
bring
out
his
original
car
certainly
capitalize
that
idea
to
the
full
possible
extent
and
i
think
a
great
deal
of
his
success
be
due
to
that
single
thing
slowly
but
surely
we
be
get
our
car
down
nearer
the
ground
this
of
course
be
to
a
certain
extent
a
mechanical
feature
but
nevertheless
it
involves
the
appearance
as
well
i
be
sure
we
all
realize
how
much
appearance
have
to
do
with
sale
with
all
car
fairly
good
mechanically
it
be
a
dominate
proposition
and
in
a
product
such
as
ours
where
the
individual
appeal
be
so
great
it
mean
a
tremendous
influence
on
our
future
prosperity
when
it
come
to
our
body
design
i
be
sure
we
all
recognize
the
quality
the
wonderful
workmanship
and
the
constructiveness
from
every
standpoint
of
fisher
body
they
speak
for
themselves
irrespective
of
all
this
however
the
question
arises
be
we
as
advanced
from
the
standpoint
of
beauty
of
design
harmony
of
line
attractiveness
of
color
scheme
and
general
contour
of
the
whole
piece
of
apparatus
as
we
be
in
the
soundness
of
workmanship
and
the
other
element
of
a
more
mechanical
nature
that
be
the
point
i
be
raise
and
i
believe
it
be
a
very
fundamental
one
at
the
present
time
one
of
our
very
important
line
be
be
revamped
from
the
appearance
standpoint
the
action
i
mention
in
the
last
line
of
this
letter
be
to
make
style
history
lawrence
p
fisher
who
be
then
general
manager
of
cadillac
share
with
me
a
belief
in
the
importance
of
appearance
he
have
be
visit
some
of
the
dealer
and
distributor
around
the
country
among
them

own
in
conjunction
with
his
sale
operation
a
custom
body
shop
in
which
he
built
special
body
on
both
foreign
and
american
chassis
for
hollywood
movie
star
and
wealthy
people
of
california
mr
fisher
be
impressed
with
the
style
of
these
california
car
and
paid
a
visit
to
the
shop
where
custom
body
be
built
there
he
met
their
young
chief
designer
and
the
director
of

which
don

subsequently
purchase
he
be
do
thing
in
a
way
that
mr
fisher
have
never
see
before
for
one
thing
he
be
use
model
clay
to
develop
the
form
of
various
automobile
component
instead
of
the
then
conventional
wood
model
and
hand
hammer
metal
part
use
in
development
work
also
he
be
design
the
complete
automobile
shape
the
body
hood
fender
headlight
and
run
board
and
blending
them
together
into
a
good
look
whole
this
too
be
a
novel
technique
mr
fisher
saw
mr
earl
lengthen
the
wheel
base
by
cut
the
frame
and
insert
an
extra
piece
the
result
be
a
long
low
custom
body
that
pleased
many
famous
screen
personality
it
be
an
important
meeting
for
mr

s
interest
in
this
young
man
s
talent
be
to
result
in
actively
influence
the

invite
mr

and
work
for
him

have
a
particular
project
in
mind
that
of
design
a
quality
car
of
the
same
family
as
cadillac
but
somewhat
low
price
we
felt
that
there
be
a
grow
market
for
a
car
of
this
type
the
idea
be
to
approach
the
design
with
a
new
concept
in
mind
that
of
unify
the
various
part
of
the
car
from
the
standpoint
of
appearance
of
round
off
sharp
corner
and
of
lower
the
silhouette
we
want
a
production

that
be
as
beautiful
as
the
custom
car
of
the
period

in
my
letter

the

make
a
sensational
debut
in

and
it
be
a
significant
car
in
american
automotive
history
the
la

be
the
first
stylist
s
car
to
achieve
success
in
mass
production
the
effectiveness
of
the
new
design
can
be

with
the
buick

be
look
for
i
be
so
impressed
with
mr
earl
s
work
that
i
decide
to
obtain
the
advantage
of
his
talent
for
other
general
motor
car
division
on
june
i
take
up
with
the
executive
committee
a
plan
to
establish
a
special
department
to
study
the
question
of
art
and
color
combination
in
general
motor
product
fifty
person
would
make
up
the
department
ten
of
them
designer
and
the
rest
shopworkers
and
clerical
and
administrative
assistant
i
invite
mr
earl
to
head
this
new
staff

and
color
section
mr
earl
s
duty
be
to
direct
general
production

section
be
make
a
part
of
the
corporation
s
general
staff
organization
even
though
it
receive
its
fund
through
the
fisher
body
division
i
be
concerned
about
how
the
division
would
take
to
the
new
department
and
felt
that
mr
earl
need
all
the
support
and
prestige
that
mr
fisher
the
cadillac
division
manager
could
give
him
furthermore
as
chief
executive

of
the

lent
mr

my
personal
support

recall
to
me
that
when

start
his

the
support
of
mr

accepted
by
the
car
division
one
of
the
first
problem
mr
earl
have
to
deal
with
be
to
find
the
staff
of
designer
call
for
in
the
plan
there
be
automotive
stylist
in
the
business
in
for
example
ray
dietrich
and
ralph
robert
of
le
baron
inc
of
new

city
who
in
the
late

be
engage
respectively
by
the
murray

of
america
and
the
briggs

p
williams
and
richard
burke
of
the

from
which
to
draw
young
men
adept
in
advanced
automobile
design
shortly
after
the
art
and
color
section
be
establish
mr
fisher
and
mr
earl
go
on
a
tour
of
europe
to
study
european
car
design
a
good
many
european
car
then
be
well
mechanically
and
in
appearance
than
american
car
but
of
course
they
be
make
in
relatively
small
number
it
struck
me
that
our
new
section
might
be
improve
by
the
addition
of
foreign
designer
i
write
mr
fisher
on
september
suggest
he
consider
that
possibility
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
and
harley
earl
be
go
abroad
would
it
not
be
a
constructive
thing
to
try
to
get
in
touch
with
men
on
the
other
side
who
could
contribute
idea
that
would
be
helpful
in
our
art
and
color
work
this
may
at
the
first
consideration
seem
impractical
because
i
recognize
the
different
viewpoint
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
on
the
other
hand
as
i
see
it
the
great
problem
of
the
future
be
to
have
our
car
different
from
each
other
and
different
from
year
to
year
recognize
the
extraordinary
talent
that
harley
earl
have
along
these
line
it
must
be
recognize
also
that
even
with
that
fact
before
us
all
the
additional
talent
that
we
can
get
will
be
need
in
view
of
the
tremendous
possibility
and
the
magnitude
of
our
operation
from
time
to
time
mr
earl
brought
car
designer
from
europe
to
his
studio
in
detroit
at
the
same
time
he
developed
over
the
year
a
school
of
american
car
designer
the
problem
of
design
a
foreign
car
and
an
american
family
car
be
quite
different
the
european
car
usually
have
little
or
no
trunk
space
and
have
seat
for
two
or
four
people
the
economics
be
different
too
horsepower
tax
and
high
gasoline
tax
have
cause
european
car
design
to
go
toward
small
engine
and
great
gas
economy
the
big
market
in
america
want
a
large
and
more
powerful
engine
and
room
for
several
passenger
and
enough
luggage
for
a
long
mileage
motor
trip
these
basic
difference
in
utility
cause
the
difference
in
appearance
between
the
european
and
american
car
design
despite
the
public
acceptance
of
the
la
salle
in
acceptance
of
the
new
art
and
color
section
within
the
corporation
be
slow
an
automobile
stylist
be
an
advocate
of
change
to
a
degree
that
be
at
first
somewhat
startle
to
production
and
engineering
executive
the
sale
section
also
have
its
fear
wouldn
t
the
car
begin
to
look
alike
on
december
b
g
koether
director
of
the
sale
section
write
several
people
have
express
the
fear
that
if
the
art
and
color
end
of
our
business
would
be
dominate
by
one
personality
it
might
possibly
be
that
in
the
future
all
general
motor
car
would
more
or
less
resemble
each
other
i
reply
to
mr
koether
as
follow
the
exact
work
out
of
the
new
set
up
art
and
color
section
be
not
yet
complete
but
if
i
have
my
way
and
i
shall
influence
a
program
so
far
as
i
can
that
provide
an
organization
have
artistic
ability
and
while
it
may
be
dominate
from
the
operating
standpoint
by
one
individual
it
will
have
in
its
organization
a
sufficient
number
of
individual
to
develop
a
diversity
of
idea
formerly
the
one
individual
have
no
appreciation
of
the
importance
of
have
thing
different
mr
earl
have
a
very
keen
appreciation
of
that
phase
of
his
problem
and
recognizes
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
him
to
revise
eight
or
nine
line
of
car
every
year
and
have
them
continually
well
more
artistic
and
yet
different
at
least
he
cannot
do
that
by
himself
it
be
also
our
idea
to
include
in
the
activity
of
this
section
color
and
upholstery
much
have
be
left
undone
in
the
past
still
in
addition
to
the
above
it
be
my
idea
to
have
the
division
set
up
more
or
less
of
a
duplicate
organization
on
a
small
scale
of
course
in
order
that
a
competitive
situation
may
at
all
time
be
maintain
this
divisional
approach
be
try
but
do
not
prove
practical
but
we
maintain
the
divisional
separateness
by
set
up
a
different
studio
in
the
style
staff
for
each
of
the
division
sale
however
be
in
the
end
the
decisive
factor
in
the
acceptance
of
the
art
and
color
section
the
market
make
it
clear
that
appearance
be
sell
car
chrysler
be
get
good
result
with
color
and
so
be
we
wherever
we
use
it
furthermore
the
year
we
start
the
art
and
color
section
be
the
year
in
which
the
model
t
ford
come
to
the
end
of
its
career
this
be
the
car
that
accord
to
legend
mr
ford
say
one
could
have
in
any
color
so
long
as
it
be
black
thus
style
come
into
the
picture
as
one
era
end
and
another
begin
on
september
i
write
to
william
a
fisher
then
president
of
fisher
body
corporation
to
sum
up
i
think
that
the
future
of
general
motor
will
be
measure
by
the
attractiveness
that
we
put
in
the
body
from
the
standpoint
of
luxury
of
appointment
the
degree
to
which
they
please
the
eye
both
in
contour
and
in
color
scheme
also
the
degree
to
which
we
be
able
to
make
them
different
from
competition
the
hesitation
within
the
corporation
to
make
use
of
the
beauty
parlor
as
the
art
and
color
section
be
sometimes
call
be
gradually
overcome
its
first
job
outside
the
cadillac
organization
be
a
face
lift
on
the
chevrolet
for
o
e
hunt
who
assist
in
establish
the
authority
of
the
art
and
color
section
within
the
corporation
the
first
car
to
be
style
completely
by
the
art
and
color
section
be
a
tremendous
flop
from
the
public
standpoint
this
be
the
buick
introduce
in
july
and
soon
dubbed
by
the
public
the
pregnant
buick
into
that
car
go
some
of
the
most
advanced
engineering
see
in
any
production
car
of
the
day
low
sale
figure
for
the
year
indicate
that
this
particular
design
be
not
accepted
and
the
car
be
take
out
of
production
as
soon
as
a
suitable
replacement
design
could
be
developed
the
controversial
feature
of
the
design
be
a
slight
bulge
or
roll
just
below
the
belt
line
which
start
at
the
hood
and
continued
around
the
entire
car
by
actual
measurement
this
curvature
extend
one
and
a
quarter
inch
from
the
side
of
the
belt
line
the
failure
of
its
appeal
indicates
that
taste
be
related
to
a
particular
period
in
modern
car
we
tolerate
a
bulge
of
three
to
five
and
a
half
inch
the
pregnant
buick
of
be
a
classic
example
of
how
the
public
generally
prefers
gradual
rather
than
drastic
change
of
design
mr
earl
have
an
artist
s
explanation
of
this
event
he
say
in
i
design
the
buick
with
a
slight
roundness
both
way
from
the
beltline
highlight
and
it
go
into
production
unfortunately
the
factory
for
operational
reason
pull
the
side
panel
in
at
the
bottom
more
than
the
design
call
for
in
addition
five
inch
be
add
in
vertical
height
with
the
result
that
the
arc
i
have
plot
be
pull
out
of
shape
in
two
direction
the
highlight
line
be
unpleasantly
locate
and
the
effect
be
bulgy
the
style
section
then
have
not
be
as
well
integrate
into
other
company
operation
as
it
be
now
and
i
be
unaware
of
what
have
happen
until
i
later
saw
the
complete
car
of
course
i
roar
like
a
ventura
sea
lion
but
it
be
too
late
to
keep
car
buyer
from
have
a
lot
of
fun
name
the
poor
enceinte
buick
for
a
long
while
the
art
and
color
section
occupy
quarter
in
the
general
motor
building
annex
in
detroit
the
focal
point
of
the

they
be
an

on
the

as

go
by
more

more
of
these

to

feasible
new
divisional
customer
materialize
as
more
and
more
people
in
the
corporation
bought
the
idea
furthermore
we
employ
woman
as
automobile
designer
to
express
the
woman
s
point
of
view
we
be
the
first
to
do
so
i
believe
and
today
we
have
the
large
number
of
them
in
the
industry
one
of
the
main
problem
of
harley
earl
and
his
section
be
to
fix
upon
certain
line
of
development
for
car
style
if
one
have
a
conception
of
how
automobile
style
would
or
should
evolve
small
successive
change
could
be
make
year
after
year
as
the
annual
model
program
demand
consumer
could
be
prepared
by
measure
step
for
more
radical
change
in
style
and
it
would
be
possible
to
avoid
such
mistake
as
the
buick
or
the
error
of
chrysler
in
when
it
come
out
with
a
car
the
airflow
design
that
be
overly
streamline
harley
earl
have
no
doubt
as
to
what
the
main
line
of
development
in
car
style
should
be
he
say
in
my
primary
purpose
for
twenty
eight
year
have
be
to
lengthen
and
low
the
american
automobile
at
time
in
reality
and
always
at
least
in
appearance
why
because
my
sense
of
proportion
tell
me
that
oblong
be
more
attractive
than
square
contribute
to
this
main
line
of
style
development
be
a
secondary
line
to
integrate
projection
from
the
car
into
the
body
almost
all
the
major
achievement
of
mr
earl
and
his
style
section
in
the
thirty
five
year
since
it
be
establish
have
contribute
to
this
style
evolution
in
the
s
i
rename
the
art
and
color
section
the
style
section
in
the
terminology
of
the
automobile
business
model
appearance
be
now
generally
call
style
and
the
designer
be
stylist
the
model
present
the
first
of
the
so
call
a
body
for
chevrolet
and
introduce
some
significant
development
the
body
be
extend
in
all
direction
in
an
attempt
to
cover
some
of
the
ugly
projection
and
expose
part
of
the
chassis
which
be
still
in
evidence
the
gas
tank
be
cover
with
what
the
stylist
call
a
beaver
tail
the
radiator
be
hidden
behind
a
grille
the
traditional
exterior
visor
have
be
remove
in
the
model
and
replace
by
a
curve
windshield
header
and
in
the
model
the
height
of
the
apron
the
panel
between
the
bottom
of
the
door
and
the
run
board
which
be
nothing
more
than
a
cover
up
for
the
frame
be
reduce
the
final
touch
be
to
add
fender
skirt
which
help
hide
the
encrustation
under
the
fender
mr
earl
s
effort
to
reduce
the
height
of
the
car
ran
into
engineering
problem
the
car
body
of
the
late
twenty
as
i
have
point
out
do
not
drop
down
between
the
front
and
rear
wheel
as
it
do
today
but
rest
upon
the
axle
and
be
therefore
so
high
that
a
run
board
or
step
be
need
to
enter
the
car
mr
earl
want
to
lengthen
the
wheel
base
and
move
the
engine
forward
of
the
front
wheel
from
its
position
behind
them
so
that
the
frame
and
body
could
be
lower
and
the
passenger
could
sit
ahead
of
the
rear
wheel
instead
of
above
them
but
if
the
body
be
lower
to
this
extent
it
create
the
problem
of
where
to
put
the
transmission
the
engineer
also
object
that
lengthen
the
body
add
weight
and
shift
the
position
of
the
motor
change
the
standard
weight
distribution
all
of
which
create
new
and
difficult
problem
there
be
various
way
of
overcome
these
problem
one

the

perfect

we
be
able
to
make

there
be
many
people
in
the

who
be
dead
set
against
this
innovation
some
of
the
old
timer
remember
how
early
version
of
the
all
steel
roof
make
a
drum
noise
object
but
the
old
roof
be
square
and
boxy
while
the
new
design
have
a
generous
crown
and
curve
side
which
help
to
reduce
the
drum
the
new
silhouette
also
fit
into
the
main
line
of
development
of
automobile
style
but
the
new
roof
lead
to
some
heat
discussion
among
the
responsible
executive
of
the
corporation
when
a
division
chief
engineer
would
condemn
the
design
for
noise
make
characteristic
another
executive
would
claim
that
the
trouble
be
cause
not
by
the
design
but
by
the
vibration
within
the
engine
but
the
advanced
idea
won
out

in

appear
with

the
now
famous

this
be
a
constructive
move
one
of
the
big
advance
in
car
design
in
car
safety
and
in
manufacturing
technique
it
make
it
possible
to
stamp
out
whole

press
in
the

thirty
the
art

section
propose
make
the
trunk
an
integral
part
of
the
body
an
idea
that
be
quite
a
departure
from
the
then
accepted
practice
of
use
a
separate
trunk
strap
to
a
rack
the
idea
be
try
out
on
the
cadillac
and
on
other
luxury
car
and
after
this
tryout
be
adopt
on
the

in
the
built
in
trunk
and
its
partner
the
extend
deck
on
which
it
sits
be
significant
however
because
they
alter
the
overall
shape
of
the
car
and
help
make
it
longer
and
apparently
low
and
by
provide
storage
space
for
the
spare
tire
the
built
in
trunk
help
eliminate
one
more
projection
from
the
car
here
be
another
case
where
style
change
make
some
people
unhappy
for
these
development
meant
an
apparent
loss
of
accessory
business
in
trunk
rack
tire
cover
and
the
like
at
a
time
when
accessory
be
very
profitable
item
but
such
be
the
price
of
progress
the
first
sedan
to
use
an
extend

be
the
cadillac
special
this
car
hold
an
important
place
in
style
history
it
be
the
first
special
car
design
to
introduce
new
feature
and
to
be
sell
at
a
high
price
and
be
follow
later
by
the
ford
s
lincoln
continental
and
other
special
car
it
be
the
first
general
motor
car
and
the
first
modern
mass
production
car
without
a
run
board
in
addition
to
dispose
of
another
projection
the
elimination
of
the
run
board
make
it
possible
to
widen
the
basic
body
pattern
to
the
full
tread
of
the
wheel
so
that
the
standard
car
become
one
that
could
hold
six
passenger
it
be
the
first
car
that
though
a
sedan
be

like
a

and
be
thus
a
forerunner
of
the
very
successful

the

to
take

it
the
grow
importance

symbolize
by
the
appointment
of
harley

as
a
vice
president
of
the

on
september
he
be
the
first
stylist
to
be
give
such
a
position
and
indeed
i
believe
the
first
designer
in
any
major
industry
to
become
a
vice
president
during
world
war
ii

a
time
in
military
camouflage
design
it
be
at
the
end
of
the
war
as
i
have
say
that
we
conclude
that
the
consumer
would
rank
style
first
automatic
transmission
second
and
high

engine
third
but
in
the
year
immediately
follow

ii
there
be
few
extensive
change
in
automobile
design
for
the
first
aim
of
all

be
simply
to
supply
the
great

however
in
these
year
the
long
lead
built
up
by

before
the

have
the

for
a

the
only
one
after
the

ford
and
chrysler
set
up
system
of

and
of
integrate

similar
to
those
first
developed
at

staffed
their

the

the
role
of
style
become
dominant
in
the
industry
as
competitive
condition
return
until
the
late
s
it
have
be
customary
to
change
body
on
a
four
year
or
even
five
year
cycle
with
face

as
the
desirability
of
new

become
apparent
a
shorter

of
vary
length
become
common
one
of
the
factor
contribute
to
the
increase
tempo
of

in

the

the

of
these
the

job
be
built
by
the

the
buick
division
in
the
idea
of
the
experimental

be
to
test
new
style
and
engineering
idea
in
a
complete
new
car
after
the

we
built
new
experimental

and
exhibit
them
to
the
public
to
test
the

to
the
advanced

they
incorporate
the

of
the

to

so
call
dream

show
that
the
public
want
and
be
ready
to
accept
more
dare
step
in
style
and
engineering
the
style
staff
also
built
experimental
car
of
such
advanced
design
that
they
be
not
expect
to
influence
production
car
for

to
come

in

in
cooperation
with
the
research
laboratory
in
indeed
the
rapid
movement
in
style
in
the
late
forty
and
fifty
sometimes
seem
to
many
people
to
have
become
too
extreme
new
style
feature
be
introduce
that
be
far
remove
from
utility
yet
they
seem
demonstrably
effective
in
capture
public
taste
one
of
the
most
strike
of
these
feature
of
the
postwar
car
be
the
tail
fin
which
first
appear
on
the
cadillac
in
and
which
though
at
first
it
be
not
easy
to
sell
have
since
appear
on
almost
every
major
line
of
car
in
one
exaggerated
form
or
another
the
story
of
the
tail
fin
begin
during
the
war
when
an
air
force
friend
of
harley
earl
invite
him
to
see
some
new
fighter
plane
one
of
them
be
the
p
which
have
twin
allison
engine
twin
fuselage
and
twin
tail
fin
when
mr
earl
saw
it
he
ask
if
he
could
have
some
of
his
designer
look
at
it
and
after
they
receive
clearance
they
be
allow
to
view
the
plane
they
be
just
as
impressed
as
mr
earl
and
a
few
month
later
their
sketch
begin
to
show
sign
of
fin
one
important
new
development
have
be
a
grow
emphasis
on
special
type
of
car
sport
car
station
wagon
hardtop
and
other
special
car
at
high
price
year
of
prosperity
have
make
it
possible
for
many
family
to
own
two
or
even
three
car
and
it
be
reasonable
for
the
second
or
third
car
not
to
be
a
standard
sedan
for
this
and
other
reason
the
demand
rise
also
for
the
small
car
thus
widen
the
range
of
the
market
at
the
bottom
as
well
as
the
top
the
grow
emphasis
on
leisure
time
activity
have
lead
to
a
great
interest
in
pleasure
car
as
be
the
case
in
the
early
day
as
harley
earl
have
say
you
can
design
a
car
so
that
every
time
you
get
in
it
it
s
a
relief
you
have
a
little
vacation
for
a
while
today
the
style
staff
design
a
variety
of
vacation
at
the
same
time
the
automobile
be
more
than
ever
the
dominant
form
of
basic
ground
transportation
in
the
united
state
chapter
distribution
and
the
dealer
whenever
the
automobile
market
shift
from
a
buyer
to
a
seller
or
a
seller
to
a
buyer
market
a
turbulence
take
place
in
the
industry
which
disturbs
both
producer
and
dealer
and
certain
adjustment
have
to
be
make
to
meet
the
change
condition
some
of
these
adjustment
be
commonplace
but
since
history
never
exactly
repeat
itself
there
be
always
some
element
of
novelty
to
be
met
so
it
be
in
the
present
and
so
it
have
be
throughout
the
development
of
the
dealer
system
of
distribution
when
i
be
chief
executive
officer
of
general
motor
i
give
a
large
part
of
my
attention
to
dealer
relation
amount
at
time
you
might
say
almost
to
a
specialization
i
do
so
because
the
experience
of
the
s
when
the
modern
problem
of
automobile
distribution
take
shape
taught
me
that
a
stable
dealer
organization
be
a
necessary
condition
for
the
progress
and
stability
of
an
enterprise
in
this
industry
contrary
to
this
the
prevail
attitude
of
the
industry
in
the
early
twenty
be
rather
that
the
manufacturer
should
attend
to
the
product
the
price
the
advertising
and
promotion
and
leave
the
rest
of
the
element
of
distribution
to
the
dealer
to
work
out
there
be
some
who
minimize
the
role
of
the
dealer
they
assume
that
the
customer
be
for
the
most
part
sell
before
he
enter
a
dealer
s
salesroom
and
so
neglect
to
develop
a
stable
dealer
organization
the
soundness
of
the
individual
dealer
s
position
and
the
complexity
of
the
internal
problem
of
his
organization
and
market
be
not
consider
to
be
the
concern
of
the
manufacturer
from
my
point
of
view
the
welfare
of
the
more
than
general
motor
passenger
car
dealer
in
the
united
state
with
their
billion
or
so
of
invest
capital
must
be
a
major
concern
of
the
corporation
the
franchise
system
of
distribution
make
sense
only
if
you
have
a
group
of
sound
prosperous
dealer
as
business
associate
i
have
never
be
interested
in
business
relationship
that
be
not
of
benefit
to
all
concerned
it
be
my
belief
that
everyone
should
hold
up
his
end
of
the
relationship
and
be
reward
accordingly
the
significance
of
the
dealer
in
automobile
distribution
be
twofold
first
as
in
many
industry
the
dealer
make
the
direct
personal
contact
with
the
customer
he
make
and
close
the
deal
that
sell
the
car
the
producer
s
contact
on
the
other
hand
be
with
the
dealer
not
the
customer
except
to
the
extent
that
the
producer
speaks
to
the
public
as
a
whole
through
advertising
automobile
show
and
other
instrumentality
and
i
might
add
that
the
product
on
the
street
and
highway
be
a
persuasive
message
to
the
consumer

in

what

if
you
imagine
a
spectrum
of
the
type
of
retail
distribution
in
the
united
state
you
would
find
typically
at
one
end
the
merchant
such
as
the
corner
grocer
who
sell
numerous
and
often
compete
product
make
by
various
manufacturer
and
whose
only
relationship
with
any
manufacturer
be
that
of
a
conventional
buyer
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
be
a
merchant
for
example
a
gas
station
owner
who
be
the
agent
of
a
single
manufacturer
even
sometimes
a
branch
or
subsidiary
of
a
manufacturer
in
this
spectrum
the
franchise
automobile
dealer
in
his
relation
to
the
manufacturer
lie
somewhere
between
the
above
extreme
legally
he
be
not
the
agent
of
the
manufacturer
yet
in
his
community
he
be
identify
with
the
manufacturer
s
product
generally
speak
he
be
assign
an
area
of
sale
responsibility
for
cultivation
however
he
be
not
restrict
from
sell
elsewhere
and
the
other
dealer
be
free
to
sell
in
his
area
the
individual
franchise
dealer
usually
a
substantial
businessman
in
his
local
community
meet
the
customer
often
as
a
neighbor
trade
with
him
and
service
the
product
sell
the
personality
acquaintance
and
stand
of
the
dealer
as
a
local
merchant
be
basic
to
the
type
of
franchise
distribution
which
have
become
the
custom
in
the
automobile
industry
our
entire
sale
approach
be
base
upon
this
system
of
individually
finance
merchant
to
whom
we
offer
a
potential
profit
opportunity
base
upon
the
general
motor
franchise
both
the
dealer
and
the
manufacturer
in
their
relationship
have
special
right
and
undertake
special
obligation
they
sign
a
sell
agreement
that
involves
condition
in
other
word
the
relationship
of
dealer
and
producer
be
govern
by
the
franchise
the
dealer
agrees
to
provide
capital
a
place
of
business
an
adequate
number
of
salesman
mechanic
for
service
and
the
like
he
be
expect
to
cultivate
his
area
of
responsibility
and
to
stock
and
sell
spare
part
and
so
on
in
return
for
such
franchise
obligation
the
manufacturer
sell
almost
entirely
through
the
franchise
dealer
dealer
as
a
group
obtain
the
privilege
of
sell
the

trademarked
product
and
be
support
in
their
sale
effort
by
the
general
merchandising
activity
of
the
manufacturer
the
manufacturer
make
large
investment
in
tool
for
the
annual
model
change
and
in
research
and
engineering
development
to
ensure
that
his
product
be
desirable
a
special
feature
of
the
franchise
system
be
the
amount
and
type
of
assistance
that
the
manufacturer
render
to
the
automobile
dealer
this
include
technical
help
and
program
in
all
phase
of
the
dealer
s
business
such
as
sale
and
service
advertising
business
management
and
specialized
factory
conduct
training
program
design
to
assist
in
every
phase
of
the
dealer
s
operation
the
automobile
be
not
like
the
usual
product
that
customer
buy
off
the
shelf
every
day
it
be
a
highly
complex
mechanical
product
it
represent
a
large
investment
for
the
average
purchaser
he
expect
to
operate
it
perhaps
daily
yet
the
chance
be
he
posse
little
or
no
mechanical
knowledge
he
depends
on
his
dealer
to
service
and
maintain
the
product
for
him
therefore
the
dealer
must
not
only
make
a
substantial
investment
in
facility
and
organization
for
the
display
and
sale
of
his
product
which
be
practically
the
sole
function
of
the
average
retail
establishment
but
he
must
also
provide
facility
and
an
organization
to
service
the
product
after
it
be
sell
and
throughout
its
useful
life
beyond
this
he
must
be
prepared
to
take
in
trade
recondition
and
sell
one
or
two
use
car
on
the
average
for
each
new
car
sell
since
he
may
need
to
resell
the
use
car
on
a
trading
basis
both
the
manufacturer
and
the
franchise
dealer
undertake
normal
and
related
business
risk
the
dealer
in
his
investment
in
sell
and
service
facility
the
manufacturer
in
his
investment
in
produce
facility
include
engineering
development
and
high
annual
tool
cost
both
depend
upon
the
appeal
the
manufacturer
give
to
the
product
and
the
ability
of
the
franchise
dealer
efficiently
to
sell
and
service
the
product
the
achievement
of
our
two
goal
in
distribution
namely
the
economic
movement
of
the
product
and
a
stable
network
of
franchise
dealer
who
move
the
product
have
take
much
thought
and
work
over
many
year
for
the
problem
be
complicate
they
change
to
some
extent
with
change
circumstance
and
the
solution
have
not
always
immediately
present
themselves
policy
and
practice
that
be
satisfactory
at
one
time
may
not
be
best
suit
to
later
condition
a
new
model
so
to
speak
in
dealer
relation
may
be
need
from
time
to
time
before
automobile
distribution
be
base
in
the
main
upon
distributor
wholesaler
who
subcontract
to
dealer
in
their
jurisdiction
but
in
the
course
of
time
manufacturer
generally
speak
take
over
the
wholesale
function
for
more
intensive
cultivation
and
the
franchise
dealer
maintain
the
retail
function
the
question
might
arise
why
the
automobile
industry
adopt
this
form
of
distribution
the
answer
i
think
in
part
be
that
automobile
manufacturer
could
not
without
great
difficulty
have
undertaken
to
merchandise
their
own
product
when
the
use
car
come
into
the
picture
in
a
big
way
in
the
s
as
a
trade
in
on
a
new
car
the
merchandising
of
automobile
become
more
a
trading
proposition
than
an
ordinary
sell
proposition
organize
and
supervise
the
necessary
thousand
of
complex
trading
institution
would
have
be
difficult
for
the
manufacturer
trading
be
a
knack
not
easy
to
fit
into
the
conventional
type
of
a
managerially
control
scheme
of
organization
so
the
retail
automobile
business
grow
up
with
the
franchise
dealer
type
of
organization
between
and
the
leveling
of
demand
for
new
car
logically
result
in
a
change
of
emphasis
in
the
industry
from
production
to
distribution
on
the
sale
end
that
meant
a
change
from
easy
sell
to
hard
sell
dealer
problem
of
an
entirely
new
nature
begin
to
arise
to
meet
this
situation
i
make
it
a
practice
throughout
the
s
and
early
thirty
to
make
personal
visit
to
dealer
i
fit
up
a
private
railroad
car
as
an
office
and
in
the
company
of
several
associate
go
into
almost
every
city
in
the
united
state
visit
from
five
to
ten
dealer
a
day
i
would
meet
them
in
their
own
place
of
business
talk
with
them
across
their
own
desk
in
their
closing
room
and
ask
them
for
suggestion
and
criticism
concern
their
relation
with
the
corporation
the
character
of
the
product
the
corporation
s
policy
the
trend
of
consumer
demand
their
view
of
the
future
and
many
other
thing
of
interest
in
the
business
i
make
careful
note
of
all
the
point
that
come
up
and
when
i
get
back
home
i
study
them
i
do
this
because
i
realize
that
irrespective
of
how
efficient
our
regular
organization
might
be
there
be
a
special
value
in
personal
contact
and
furthermore
as
chief
executive
officer
of
the
corporation
my
interest
be
primarily
in
general
policy
this
time
and
effort
consume
approach
to
the
problem
be
particularly
effective
under
the
circumstance
exist
at
that
time
when
we
knew
so
little
about
the
fact
of
distribution
in
the
field
many
thing
that
we
learn
be
subsequently
reflect
in
our
dealer
sell
agreement
and
communication
in
particular
be
put
on
an
establish
basis
through
council
and
in
other
way
which
at
least
in
part
serve
to
meet
the
same
need
from
the
field
study
that
we
make
i
be
able
to
see
the
historic
change
that
be
under
way
during
the
middle
and
late
twenty
that
the
economic
position
of
the
dealer
be
become
less
satisfactory
than
it
have
be
and
that
our
franchise
be
less
in
demand
it
be
clear
that
something
have
to
be
do
not
only
in
the
interest
of
our
dealer
whose
business
be
at
stake
but
in
the
interest
of
the
enterprise
as
a
whole
we
have
to
distribute
car
on
a
sound
and
economic
basis
for
all
concerned
i
note
the
dealer
predicament
in
the
change
condition
in
an
address
i
make
to
the
automobile
editor
of
american
newspaper
on
september
in
connection
with
a
meeting
at
our
prove
ground
at
milford
michigan
speak
of
past
practice
in
the
industry
as
a
whole
i
make
this
observation
the
sole
idea
be
to
make
as
many
car
as
the
factory
could
possibly
turn
out
and
then
the
sale
department
would
force
the
dealer
to
take
and
pay
for
those
car
irrespective
of
the
economic
justification
of
so
do
i
mean
irrespective
of
the
dealer
ability
to
properly
merchandise
such
car
that
certainly
be
wrong
and
it
be
just
as
wrong
in
other
industry
as
it
be
in
our
industry
the
quicker
merchandise
can
be
move
from
the
raw
material
to
the
ultimate
consumer
and
the
minimum
amount
of
merchandise
of
whatever
it
may
consist
involve
in
the
float
so
to
speak
the
more
efficient
and
more
stable
industry
becomes
it
be
absolutely
against
the
policy
of
general
motor
to
require
dealer
to
take
car
in
excess
of
what
they
properly
should
take
naturally
once
in
a
while
in
the
closing
out
of
a
model
our
dealer
must
necessarily
help
us
they
appreciate
their
responsibility
and
never
object
to
do
so
this
statement
of
policy
in
start
a
new
approach
to
producer
dealer
relation
in
general
motor
base
upon
the
recognition
of
the
community
of
interest
between
the
corporation
and
its
dealer
and
of
the
interdependence
of
our
interest
the
central
and
continue
problem
of
automobile
distribution
which
first
arose
in
the
twenty
and
thirty
be
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
business
these
be
broadly
the
penetration
of
market
the
liquidation
of
inventory
at
the
end
of
a
model
run
dealer
economics
and
the
general
difficulty
of
two
way
communication
between
the
manufacturer
and
its
dealer
on
all
of
their
mutual
business
affair
our
intention
naturally
be
to
penetrate
the
market
as
effectively
as
possible
and
since
in
the
end
this
have
to
be
carry
out
by
our
dealer
it
be
necessary
to
have
the
appropriate
number
of
dealer
each
of
the
appropriate
size
and
in
the
appropriate
location
the
difficulty
be
to
determine
these
location
in
the
s
we
do
not
know
as
much
as
we
do
now
about
the
automobile
market
we
begin
then
to
make
economic
study
of
the
market
and
its
potential
in
term
of
population
income
past
performance
business
cycle
and
the
like
with
this
kind
of
information
we
be
able
to
take
up
the
problem
of
place
dealer
in
relation
to
the
market
potential
in
a
community
of
a
few
thousand
inhabitant
for
example
the
problem
be
simple
a
single
dealer
could
do
everything
necessary
to
penetrate
the
market
and
we
and
the
dealer
could
judge
on
the
basis
of
our
study
what
his
goal
should
be
and
how
well
he
perform
in
relation
to
those
goal
but
in
the
large
urban
community
those
with
a
million
inhabitant
or
more
the
problem
be
complicate
hence
we
study
a
large
community
first
as
a
whole
to
determine
its
likely
potential
for
any
particular
line
of
car
then
we
broke
it
down
on
a
neighborhood
basis
to
determine
the
potential
of
its
constituent
part
with
that
information
we
be
able
to
place
dealer
through
the
territory
largely
on
the
basis
of
neighborhood
potential
it
be
of
course
necessary
for
the
dealer
to
have
the
individual
capital
plant
overhead
and
organization
appropriate
to
the
size
of
the
area
serve
this
strike
me
as
a
rational
approach
to
the
problem
of
distribution
it
provide
basic
advantage
for
both
the
dealer
and
the
manufacturer
the
dealer
as
i
have
say
be
a
specialist
in
his
area
and
know
its
character
and
inhabitant
well
than
anyone
else
could
also
it
be
often
more
convenient
for
a
customer
to
deal
with
a
local
merchant
from
many
standpoint
include
service
and
it
provide
the
manufacturer
with
a
microscopic
understand
of
his
distribution
problem
naturally
we
expect
a
dealer
to
give
his
first
attention
to
his
immediate
market
and
to
perform
well
in
it
the
problem
of
liquidate
an
old
model
to
make
way
for
a
new
one
and
to
keep
inventory
loss
at
a
minimum
be
a
permanent
feature
of
the
business
except
in
period
when
there
be
a
strong
seller
market
this
problem
first
appear
in
an
important
way
in
the
late
s
it
occurs
because
the
dealer
must
establish
estimate
of
their
requirement
three
month
in
advance
base
on
prospective
demand
the
corporation
take
these
estimate
into
account
in
establish
its
final
production
schedule
these
must
be
determine
month
in
advance
and
if
the
expect
demand
be
upset
by
change
condition
the
problem
of
liquidation
of
the
current
model
may
become
abnormal
but
normal
or
abnormal
it
be
a
problem
to
be
met
in
the
early
twenty
the
car
the
dealer
have
on
hand
at
the
time
the
new
model
be
announce
have
to
be
liquidate
at
their
own
expense
after
a
good
deal
of
study
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
only
fair
for
the
corporation
to
share
the
responsibility
for
liquidation
of
the
old
model
my
recollection
be
that
we
provide
allowance
for
liquidation
at
the
end
of
the
model
year
as
early
as
the
second
half
of
the
s
in
we
make
it
a
matter
of
policy
to
help
the
dealer
dispose
of
his
excess
stock
at
the
end
of
the
model
year
for
the
dealer
who
have
take
his
contract
we
grant
an
allowance
on
the
unsold
new
vehicle
in
stock
when
new
model
be
announce
the
allowance
be
limited
to
those
car
in
excess
of
percent
of
the
estimate
quantity
of
new
vehicle
to
be
handle
by
the
dealer
as
provide
for
in
the
sell
agreement
the
amount
of
such
allowance
be
determine
by
general
motor
at
time
the
amount
and
basis
of
computation
have
differ
at
present
the
rebate
be
percent
of
the
list
price
on
every
new
unused
car
of
the
model
be
discontinue
in
dealer
stock
and
unsold
at
the
time
of
the
new
model
announcement
this
policy
i
believe
be
new
in
the
industry
when
we
begin
it
it
reflect
our
desire
to
protect
dealer
against
unreasonable
product
depreciation
loss
and
to
place
the
responsibility
for
reasonable
production
schedule
in
the
later
month
of
the
model
year
on
the
management
of
the
division
it
impose
a
penalty
on
the
factory
in
the
form
of
an
automatic
assessment
if
for
any
reason
there
be
an
excess
supply
of
car
in
the
model
year
a
theoretical
solution
of
the
annual
production
and
sale
cycle
one
might
think
would
be
to
have
no
stock
in
dealer
hand
when
the
new
car
be
announce
but
that
be
neither
possible
nor
desirable
for
a
number
of
reason
from
both
the
manufacturer
s
and
the
dealer
s
standpoint
competitively
we
must
do
as
much
business
as
can
be
do
in
each
month
of
the
year
and
at
the
end
of
the
model
year
the
pipeline
of
distribution
must
be
empty
as
the
new
car
come
through
furthermore
it
be
often
desirable
to
have
some
stock
of
old
car
on
hand
to
do
business
during
the
early
period
of
the
new
model
run
when
the
new
model
be
first
come
through
for
these
reason
the
problem
be
a
permanent
one
and
all
in
the
day
s
work
although
in
the
s
we
have
make
great
advance
in
get
the
fact
about
general
motor
economic
position
we
do
not
then
have
the
fact
regard
the
economic
position
of
our
dealer
and
so
be
handicapped
in
think
through
dealer
problem
when
a
dealer
s
profit
position
be
fail
we
have
no
way
of
know
whether
this
be
due
to
a
new
car
problem
a
use
car
problem
a
service
problem
a
part
problem
or
some
other
problem
without
such
fact
it
be
impossible
to
put
any
sound
distribution
policy
into
effect
in
the
prove
ground
address
which
i
mention
earlier
i
make
the
follow
observation
on
this
subject
i
want
to
outline
to
you
what
i
believe
to
be
a
great
weakness
in
the
automotive
industry
today
and
what
general
motor
be
try
to
do
to
correct
that
weakness
i
have
state
frankly
to
general
motor
dealer
in
almost
every
city
in
the
united
state
that
i
be
deeply
concerned
with
the
fact
that
many
of
them
even
those
who
be
carry
on
in
a
reasonably
efficient
manner
be
not
make
the
return
on
their
capital
that
they
should
right
here
let
me
say
that
so
far
as
general
motor
dealer
be
concerned
from
what
fact
i
have
i
realize
there
have
be
much
improvement
during
the
past
two
or
three
year
but
interested
as
the
management
of
general
motor
must
be
in
every
step
from
the
raw
material
to
the
ultimate
consumer
and
recognize
that
this
chain
of
circumstance
be
no
strong
than
its
weak
link
i
feel
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
operating
position
of
our
dealer
organization
as
a
whole
i
hope
that
this
feel
of
uncertainty
be
unwarranted
i
be
sure
that
with
a
responsibility
so
great
all
element
of
uncertainty
must
be
eliminate
and
that
our
dealer
should
know
the
fact
about
their
operating
position
as
clearly
and
as
scientifically
as
i
have
outline
to
you
we
feel
that
we
know
the
fact
about
general
motor
operating
position
this
brings
us
back
to
two
word
proper
accounting
many
of
our
dealer
and
the
same
thing
applies
to
dealer
of
other
organization
have
good
accounting
system
many
of
them
have
indifferent
one
and
i
regret
to
say
that
too
large
a
percentage
of
them
have
practically
no
accounting
system
at
all
many
of
those
who
have
accounting
system
through
lack
of
their
be
properly
developed
be
not
able
to
effectively
use
them
in
other
word
they
be
not
so
developed
that
they
give
the
dealer
the
fact
about
his
business
where
the
leak
be
what
he
should
do
to
improve
his
position
as
i
say
before
uncertainty
must
be
eliminate
uncertainty
and
efficiency
be
as
far
apart
as
the
north
pole
be
from
the
south
if
i
could
wave
a
magic
wand
over
our
dealer
organization
with
the
result
that
every
dealer
could
have
a
proper
accounting
system
could
know
the
fact
about
his
business
and
could
intelligently
deal
with
the
many
detail
incident
to
his
business
in
an
intelligent
manner
as
a
result
thereof
i
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
that
accomplishment
an
enormous
sum
and
i
would
be
fully
justified
in
do
so
it
would
be
the
best
investment
general
motor
ever
make
accordingly
in
we
set
up
an
organization
call
motor
accounting
company
we
developed
a
standardize
accounting
system
applicable
to
all
dealer
and
sent
a
staff
into
the
field
to
help
install
it
and
to
establish
an
audit
system
later
as
dealer
become
more
experienced
in
the
financial
end
of
their
business
and
under
the
pressure
of
depression
economy
we
modify
the
review
procedure
we
developed
a
sample
system
for
audit
by
which
we
be
able
to
get
a
cross
section
analysis
applicable
to
the
whole
setup
to
this
end
the
accounting
record
of
a
group
of
approximately
automobile
dealer
represent
about
percent
of
dealer
or
percent
of
general
motor
unit
sale
be
still
review
regularly
at
general
motor
own
expense
in
addition
general
motor
get
monthly
financial
statement
from
percent
of
its
dealer
or
percent
of
general
motor
unit
sale
this
be
a
big
and
expensive
effort
but
it
enable
each
division
of
general
motor
and
the
central
office
to
look
through
the
whole
distribution
system
dealer
by
dealer
and
group
by
group
and
determine
just
where
the
weakness
be
and
what
should
be
do
about
them
furthermore
the
dealer
himself
could
not
only
judge
his
own
complicate
business
intelligently
but
also
compare
his
operation
item
by
item
with
group
average
often
the
soft
spot
would
be
discover
in
time
to
make
correction
before
harm
be
do
soft
spot
of
course
on
occasion
have
a
way
of
make
themselves
know
in
the
late
twenty
general
motor
put
up
considerable
capital
to
save
a
couple
of
strategic
dealership
from
bankruptcy
and
suffer
a
loss
of
one
thought
lead
to
another
however
and
when
we
get
this
one
generalize
we
realize
that
our
broad
purpose
should
be
not
only
to
reduce
dealer
turnover
by
stabilize
dealership
but
furthermore
to
assist
capable
individual
who
lack
capital
to
become
the
owner
of
profitable
general
motor
dealership
albert
l
deane
then
a
vice
president
of
gmac
and
donaldson
brown
work
these
thought
into
a
practical
program
we
take
action
on
the
idea
in
june
by
set
up
motor
hold
corporation
with
mr
deane
as
its
first
president
in
this
subsidiary
become
the
motor
hold
division
the
function
of
this
division
be
to
furnish
capital
to
dealership
and
in
do
so
to
assume
temporarily
the
right
and
duty
of
a
shareholder
in
those
dealership
we
put
into
it
to
start
when
we
get
past
the
experimental
stage
we
realize
that
this
be
one
of
the
best
idea
we
ever
have
in
the
distribution
field
we
also
realize
that
its
real
value
be
not
in
the
first
idea
of
salvage
bankruptcy
but
in
the
second
idea
of
grubstake
capable
men
not
only
with
capital
but
with
management
advice
and
training
in
sound

back
them
with
adequate

enable
them
to
produce
profit
sufficient
to
retire
motor
hold
s
interest
and
become
independent
in
my
time
it
work
this
way
and
with
some
alteration
in
financial
detail
it
still
do
the
prospective
dealer
invest
his
available
fund
in
the
dealership

put
up
the
balance
of
the
capital
need
at
present
the
dealer
usually
put
up
a
minimum
of
percent
of
the
total
require
capital
when
the
arrangement
be
establish
the

in

to
his

through
its
relinquishment
of
a
portion
of
the

which
would
otherwise
accrue
to

this

in
later
year
at
present
the
bonus
be
paid
directly
by
the

to
the
operator
and
be
therefore
a
direct
expense
of
the
dealership
corporation
it
amount
to
percent
of
the
profit
in
excess
of

on
total

to
apply
his
entire
bonus
to
buy
out

that
the
dealer
s
personal
income
tax
do
not
enable
him
to
carry
out
this
provision
and
now
the
dealer
need
apply
only
percent
of
his
bonus
to
purchase
motor
hold
s
stock
although
he
may
of
course
apply
the

the
result

that
as

accumulate
the

among
industrial

in
make
such
character
loan

and
in
recognize
that
one
of
the
great
need
of
the
economy
be
a
source
of
risk
capital
for
small
business
two
of
general

competitor
now
operate
similar

a
former

of

put
it
when
your
competitor
follow
you
that
s
the
medal
in
business
what
the
manufacturer
and
the
dealer
need
most
at
the
end
of
the
s
be
a
well
mean
of
communicate
and
a
sound
contractual
relationship
we
have
of
course
zone
and
regional
executive
who
be
in
constant
contact
with
the
dealer
on
day
to
day
matter
of
business
but
there
be
many
problem
of
broad
corporation
wide
policy
that
require
closer
contact
and
information
lead
to
some
definite
cooperative
action
as
i
have
say
the
other
general
officer
and
i
make
frequent
field
visit
to
the
dealer
these
visit
make
clear
to
us
that
the
dealer
appreciate
have
a
direct
contact
with
corporate
as
well
as
divisional
executive
it
be
equally
clear
that
something
more
substantial
be
need
than
these
occasional
visit
out
of
these
early
field
trip
therefore
grow
a
related
idea
that
of
bring
representative
group
of
dealer
into
the
conference
room
of
general
motor
this
idea
take
shape
in
the
creation
in
of
an
important
and
unique
institution
in
general
motor
the
general
motor
dealer
council
the
dealer
council
be
originally
a
body
of
forty
eight
dealer
divide
into
four
panel
of
twelve
each
it
met
with
a
group
of
corporate
executive
at
the
top
level
of
corporation
responsibility
we
form
the
council
to
hold
a
continue
series
of
round
table
discussion
on
distribution
policy
each
year
for
many
year
i
chose
a
different
panel
of
dealer
represent
all
car
manufacturing
division
all
section
of
the
country
and
all
type
of
territory
and
capital
commitment
they
brought
to
the
council
a
broad
diversification
of
dealer
problem
and
think
as
president
of
the
corporation
i
be
chairman
of
the
council
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
distribution
staff
and
other
top
official
of
general
motor
be
also
member
the
first
job
of
the
council
be
the
long
process
of
work
out
the
general
policy
for
improve
dealer
relation
our
meeting
dealt
with
policy
and
not
the
administration
of
policy
the
principal
specific
work
do
by
the
dealer
council
be
to
hold
discussion
aim
at
the
development
of
policy
on
which
an
equitable
dealer
sell
agreement
could
be
base
this
sell
agreement
when
achieve
be
to
add
value
to
the
general
motor
franchise
which
in
recent
year
have
support
a
retail
business
of
as
much
as
billion
a
year
in
a
talk
on
the
dealer
council
on
september
i
review
my
experience
in
the
meeting
of
the
council
as
follow
the
meeting
of
the
various
council
group
during
the
past
three
year
have
be
bright
spot
in
my
operating
experience
i
value
most
highly
the
personal
contact
and
the
friendship
that
have
developed
as
a
result
of
same
that
alone
would
justify
the
plan
from
my
standpoint
and
the
opportunity
to
discus
such
interest
problem
it
have
stimulate
our
think
and
i
be
sure
have
accelerate
our
progress
i
have
be
particularly
impressed
with
the
broad
approach
to
these
problem
by
every
member
of
the
council
i
be
encourage
by
the
practically
unanimous
desire
to
solve
these
problem
from
the
standpoint
of
fundamental
soundness
rather
than
from
the
easy
approach
of
expediency
this
be
particularly
interest
in
a
period
where
expediency
seem
to
be
the
keynote
of
our
national
think
this
point
of
fundamental
approach
be
particularly
impressed
upon
me
at
the
very
first
meeting
we
be
just
come
out
of
the
depression
heavy
loss
have
be
sustain
by
almost
every
one
engage
in
business
the
dealer
body
be
no
exception
to
the
rule
anxiety
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
future
profit
be
naturally
the
dominate
subject
before
the
council
many
suggestion
be
make
analyze
and
subsequently
discuss
and
it
be
gratify
that
the
unanimous
opinion
be
that
we
should
tackle
the
essential
question
of
profit
not
from
the
standpoint
of
inflation
but
from
the
standpoint
of
get
our
house
in
order
find
way
and
mean
of
eliminate
deduction
from
the
gross
that
we
already
have
well
efficiency
in
other
word
rather
than
passing
our
inefficiency
on
to
the
public
in
the
form
of
a
high
retail
price
subsequent
experience
have
justified
that
kind
of
a
decision
and
it
always
will
in
the
final
analysis
as
chairman
of
the
council
at
all
our
meeting
i
have
try
to
impress
upon
the
member
the
sincere
desire
of
the
corporation
s
executive
to
aggressively
tackle
any
problem
likely
to
result
in
a
more
satisfactory
relationship
and
as
rapidly
and
consistently
as
possible
naturally
in
a
business
as
large
as
general
motor
where
there
be
many
group
that
must
be
consult
and
viewpoint
reconcile
progress
must
necessarily
be
slow
i
have
be
concerned
with
the
fact
that
perhaps
some
of
our
council
member
and
many
of
our
dealer
who
necessarily
cannot
be
familiar
with
what
we
be
do
have
felt
that
we
should
move
more
rapidly
it
be
natural
that
they
should
feel
that
way
it
be
comparatively
easy
to
lay
down
a
policy
in
a
relatively
small
number
of
word
but
the
application
of
that
policy
in
an
administrative
way
in
a
country
as
large
as
the
united
state
with
a
scope
of
operation
such
as
we
conduct
must
necessarily
be
a
matter
of
evolution
it
cannot
be
a
matter
of
revolution
patience
be
essential
i
cannot
over
emphasize
that
point
and
superimpose
upon
these
practical
difficulty
be
the
still
hardest
problem
of
change
the
viewpoint
of
a
large
organization
with
respect
to
any
particular
way
of
do
any
particular
thing
we
all
know
how
great
be
the
inertia
of
the
human
mind
the
dealer
sell
agreement
be
a
pioneer
work
in
cooperative
business
relationship
its
technical
detail
have
evolve
over
the
year
and
some
of
them
be
complex
some
of
the
important
feature
be
design
to
meet
problem
unique
in
the
automobile
industry
the
question
of
cancellation
of
a
sell
agreement
naturally
be
a
serious
matter
both
for
the
dealer
and
for
the
manufacturer
if
the
dealer
operating
in
a
certain
area
be
not
do
the
job
he
should
be
not
deliver
a
reasonable
amount
of
the
potential
business
of
the
area
or
for
some
other
reason
be
inefficient
how
should
a
change
be
effect
it
must
be
remember
that
he
usually
have
a
substantial
amount
of
his
own
capital
tie
up
in
the
business
he
own
use
car
he
have
part
he
have
a
showroom
and
product
sign
in
the
early
day
of
the
industry
the
dealer
s
franchise
be
just
cancel
and
a
new
dealer
be
appoint
and
that
be
that
the
problem
of
liquidate
the
dealership
be
left
to
the
dealer
during
the
s
the
agreement
generally
in
use
in
the
industry
provide
for
an
indefinite
term
which
could
be
terminate
without
cause
by
the
manufacturer
on
ninety
day
notice
and
by
the
dealer
on
thirty
day
notice
provision
also
be
make
for
cancellation
by
the
manufacturer
for
cause
with
of
course
the
validity
of
such
cause
always
subject
to
test
in
the
court
in
consider
this
problem
it
must
be
recognize
that
the
dealer
as
i
have
say
before
can
sell
the
asset
of
the
business
but
he
cannot
sell
the
franchise
since
he
do
not
own
it
therefore
it
seem
desirable
to
have
a
definite
liberal
policy
to
protect
the
dealer
from
capital
loss
in
case
of
cancellation
even
if
the
cancellation
be
due
to
his
inefficiency
we
adopt
a
policy
which
include
the
follow
arrangement
the
corporation
would
take
back
from
the
dealer
at
the
price
he
have
paid
any
new
car
that
he
have
on
hand
the
corporation
would
take
back
certain
product
sign
and
special
tool
the
corporation
would
take
back
the
part
that
he
have
on
hand
provide
they
be
not
for
model
beyond
a
certain
age
if
the
dealer
have
a
lease
which
could
not
be
transfer
to
another
dealer
and
so
incur
a
loss
on
liquidation
the
corporation
would
participate
in
the
loss
the
corporation
in
effect
give
the
dealer
a
check
for
his
unencumbered
asset
and
for
a
certain
amount
of
liability
on
the
lease
in
we
recognize
complaint
that
on
occasion
sell
agreement
of
dealer
have
be
cancel
just
as
the
best
sell
season
be
about
to
commence
the
result
be
that
the
outgo
dealer
operate
his
business
at
low
profit
or
no
profit
for
a
substantial
period
prior
to
termination
of
the
sell
agreement
while
the
newly
appoint
dealer
undertook
his
operation
at
the
begin
of
the
profitable
sell
season
therefore
we
incorporate
in
our
sell
agreement
a
provision
to
the
effect
that
termination
without
cause
on
three
month
write
notice
could
be
accomplish
only
by
give
the
notice
in
the
month
of
april
may
or
june
to
be
effective
in
the
month
of
july
august
or
september
in
general
motor
introduce
a
sell
agreement
for
a
specific
period
which
provide
for
expiration
at
the
end
of
two
year
follow
the
resumption
of
production
after
the
war
actually
a
term
of
more
than
three
year
later
the
term
be
set
at
one
year
at
present
each
dealer
be
offer
the
option
of
an
agreement
for
one
year
five
year
or
for
an
indefinite
period
all
of
these
agreement
permit
termination
only
for
cause
although
upon
expiration
of
the
term
there
be
no
obligation
to
renew
another

as
well
as
the
dealer
that
come
up
for

like
to
indulge
in
a
sentiment

amount
of
pride

the

we

tremendous
pent

create
by
the
stoppage

the

the

factor
on

general

recognize
that
serious
problem
be
in
store
for
the
customer
the
dealer
and
the
factory
the
customer
s
problem
be
to
get
transportation
usually
he
be
willing
to
pay
a
premium
for
it
and
in
many
case
he
sought
prefer
delivery
the
manufacturer
be
face
with
the
problem
of
allocation
to
the
dealer
the
dealer
s
problem
be
how
to
distribute
his
car
allotment
general
motor
have
a
plan
on
march
for
allocation
of
car
to
dealer
it
be
know
as
the
sloan
plan
because
i
have
promulgate
it
it
be
in
operation
from
october
to
october
and
prove
to
be
both
equitable
and
satisfactory
it
ensure
the
dealer
a
fair
allocation
of
car
base
on
his
performance
record
and
it
reduce
to
a
minimum
claim
of
favoritism
in
distribution
it
give
us
a
rule
for
a
situation
which
might
otherwise
have
get
out
of
hand
during
the
period
of
shortage
competitive
market
condition
be
practically
nonexistent
our
recommend
resale
price
be
substantially
below
what
buyer
be
willing
to
pay
and
our
dealer
always
establish
their
own
retail
price
but
in
the
face
of
such
urgent
demand
the
inevitable
result
be
that
a
second
or
gray
market
come
into
existence
it
frequently
happen
that
when
a
customer
drove
out
of
a
dealer
s
place
of
business
with
a
new
car
he
would
not
get
beyond
the
first
stop
light
before
somebody
perhaps
a
use
car
dealer
would
drive
up
and
offer
to
take
the
car
off
his
hand
at
a
substantial
premium
over
the
price
he
have
paid
for
it
this
be
the
begin
of
some
new
postwar
distribution
problem
one
of
the
most
difficult
problem
be
bootlegging
or
the
wholesale
of
new
car
by
franchise
dealer
to
use
car
lot
this
phenomenon
can
exist
both
in
period
of
ample
supply
and
in
period
of
shortage
such
as
exist
after
world
war
ii
as
the
situation
actually
developed
it
be
not
until
the
latter
part
of
that
supply
begin
to
catch
up
with
demand
in
some
line
of
car
i
would
like
to
emphasize
begin
because
many
line
continued
in
short
supply
into
and
in
the
case
of
cadillac
into
begin
about
certain
abuse
and
bad
merchandising
practice
have
begin
to
flourish
some
have
be
in
existence
before
the
war
but
have
be
dormant
during
the
forty
others
represent
an
outgrowth
of
the
unusual
condition
of
the
early
postwar
year
bootlegging
for
example
have
exist
before
the
war
in
scatter
area
but
now
encourage
by
an
apparently
new
legal
climate
it
return
in
epidemic
and
malignant
form
this
new
legal
climate
as
i
call
it
be
establish
in
the
late
s
as
a
result
of
interpretation
of
court
decision
later
expand
by
opinion
of
the
department
of
justice
these
legal
trend
indicate
to
us
that
clause
in
our
sell
agreement
relate
to
bootlegging
and
territorial
security
might
be
consider
unduly
restrictive
of
the
dealer
s
freedom
of
action
both
these
clause
be
reluctantly
drop
from
the
sell
agreement
in
upon
the
insistence
of
legal
counsel
we
foresaw
serious
consequence
in
the
dealer
setup
even
though
at
the
time
the
effect
be
negligible
because
dealer
be
have
difficulty
get
enough
car
to
supply
their
own
regular
customer
during
the
first
half
of
the
s
the
bootlegging
situation
become
serious
new
model
of
general
motor
car
be
in
the
bootleg
market
even
before
there
be
sufficient
production
to
supply
dealer
with
necessary
stock
for
display
and
sale
purpose
the
corporation
urge
the
dealer
not
to
move
car
into
the
bootleg
market
it
also
submit
to
the
department
of
justice
for
consideration
a
propose
new
clause
for
the
sell
agreement
which
would
have
require
dealer
to
offer
car
back
to
general
motor
before
dispose
of
them
in
bootleg
channel
the
attorney
general
s
opinion
be
to
the
effect
that
the
department
of
justice
cannot
undertake
to
waive
the
institution
of
criminal
proceeding
with
respect
to
such
contractual
provision
should
we
decide
to
test
their
legality
if
they
be
incorporate
in
general
motor
corporation
sell
agreement
since
they
raise
important
question
under
the
anti
trust
law
thus
block
in
its
effort
to
contract
with
dealer
for
the
repurchase
of
car
which
the
dealer
thought
surplus
general
motor
next
advise
dealer
that
for
the
balance
of
the
model
year
it
be
prepared
to
repurchase
or
to
arrange
for
the
repurchase
by
other
general
motor
dealer
in
other
area
at
the
respective
price
paid
by
the
original
purchasing
authorize
distributor
or
dealer
any
such
new
and
unused
passenger
car
that
might
be
consider
excess
supply
the
purpose
of
this
be
to
allow
dealer
to
liquidate
through
authorize
channel
any
car
believe
to
be
in
excess
only
a
few
dealer
take
advantage
of
this
offer
either
because
they
have
no
surplus
car
or
they
prefer
to
sell
to
a
bootlegger
at
a
small
profit
contrary
in
my
opinion
to
their
own
self
interest
from
the
broad
point
of
view
it
be
the
franchise
dealer
who
supply
and
support
the
bootlegger
for
the
latter
could
not
obtain
car
except
through
some
franchise
dealer
our
effort
continued
to
be
limited
to
try
to
adjust
our
production
schedule
to
realistic
appraisal
of
the
market
and
the
competitive
situation
our
various
attempt
over
the
year
to
curb
the
practice
of
bootlegging
have
be
hamper
by
practical
limitation
beyond
our
control
however
there
be
a
sharp
decrease
in
the
practice
during
the
second
half
of
the
s
we
believe
in
the
franchise
system
of
distribution
and
have
sought
to
provide
opportunity
that
would
be
reflect
in
quality
dealer
but
the
franchise
dealer
as
well
as
the
corporation
must
support
the
opportunity
if
it
be
to
last
and
prosper
the
concept
of
the
gm
quality
dealer
program
found
on
the
proper
placement
of
dealer
base
on
analysis
of
territory
go
back
to
the
s
when
richard
h
grant
general

great
sale
executive
of
a
generation
ago
and
william
holler
another

executive
first
establish
it
but
policy
base
on
this
concept
may
be
idealization
sound
policy
be
often
modify
by
the
impact
of
outside
force
over
which
one

no

another
recurrent

for
a

the

apparently
excessive

this

be
neither

nor
desirable
and
i
have
often
say
so
in

to
dealer
however
to
condemn
the

do
not
cause
its

where
the

try

discourage

but
the
force
approve
the
practice
be
too
strong
eventually
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
only
by
individual
and
voluntary
action
on
the
part
of
the
dealer
could
this
evil
practice
be
wipe
out
in
congress
enact
legislation

the
manufacturer
to
affix
a

on
the

be
every

through

the

of

of
the
type
i
have
described
have
be
practically

perhaps
the

be
that

of
benefit

attention
to
need
adjustment
to
the
new
condition
but
in
my
opinion
the
responsibility
for
equitable
cooperation
between
dealer
and
manufacturer
be
not
for
a
legislative
body
to
work

a
joint
responsibility
of
manufacturer
and

could

end
of

as
we
know
it

what
be
the
alternative
there
be
only
two
that
i
know

either

anyone
and
everyone
as

be
sell
with
the
manufacturer
maintain
a
system
of
service
agency
i
look
askance
at
either
of
these
change
i
believe
that
the
franchise
system
which
have
long
prevail
in
the
automobile

be
the
best
one
for

chapter
gmac
a
stranger
to
the
history
of
the
automobile
business
might
wonder
how
it
happens
that
general
motor
own
one
of
the
most
important
financial
institution
in
the
united
state
through
which
the
corporation
be
engage
in
consumer
financing
first
as
to
the
fact
general
motor
subsidiary
the
general
motor
acceptance
corporation
in
the
past
few
year
have
extend
to
percent
of
the
estimate
credit
give
in
connection
with
car
sale
in
the
united
state
gmac
seek
business
only
from
general
motor
dealer
and
be
in
competition
with
bank
other
sale
finance
company
credit
union
and
local
lending
institution
i
say
in
competition
because
it
be
not
a
close
business
the
general
motor
dealer
be
free
to
use
any
finance
service
that
he
chooses
and
his
retail
customer
may
do
likewise
gmac
s
total
annual
business
currently
come
to
about
billion
in
retail
credit
and
about
billion
in
wholesale
credit
extend
to
dealer
to
finance
purchase
from
general
motor
we
get
into
this
business
over
forty
year
ago
when
the
need
for
financing
the
distribution
of
automobile
first
arose
mass
production
brought
with
it
the
need
for
a
broad
approach
to
consumer
financing
which
the
bank
do
not
then
take
kindly
to
they
neglect
i
might
say
they
decline
to
meet
the
need
and
so
some
other
mean
have
to
be
found
if
the
auto
industry
be
to
sell
car
in
large
number
when
gmac
be
form
in
facility
for
consumer
credit
on
a
national
basis
do
not
exist
merchant
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
and
before
that
i
be
told
grant
time
payment
loan
for
house
furniture
sew
machine
piano
and
other
article
too
expensive
for
most
people
to
buy
for
cash
and
i
suppose
that
bank
must
have
lent
to
select
individual
some
money
that
go
for
that
purpose
the
idea
of
consumer
finance
therefore
be
not
new
in
principle
i
understand
that
the
morris
plan
bank
begin
financing
some
automobile
purchase
around
and
that
the
practice
grow
from
then
on
but
the
application
of
consumer
finance
to
the
automobile
in
a
routine
way
be
still
new
in
when
my
friend
john
n
willys
then
president
of
the
willys
overland
company
one
of
the
most
successful
motorcar
manufacturer
at
that
time
persuade
me
to
become
a
director
of
guaranty
security
company
which
propose
to
finance
the
sale
of
willys
and
other
car
this
be
one
of
the
first
automobile
financing
institution
if
it
be
not
actually
the
first
to
be
form
to
fill
the
vacuum
create
by
the
absence
of
normal
credit
facility
it
be
also
my
first
experience
with
the
installment
plan
of
purchase
at
the
time
i
do
not
have
a
direct
interest
in
it
since
i
be
then
still
with
hyatt
and
of
course
not
make
or
sell
motorcar
john
j
raskob
as
chairman
of

motor
finance
committee
be
instrumental
in
start
gmac
from
where
i
be
then
on
the
executive
committee
i
support
the
idea
the
public
announcement
of
the
formation
of
gmac
be
make
with
the
publication
of
a
letter
date
march
from
mr
durant
to
j
amory
haskell
gmac
s
first
president
mr
durant
say
in
part
the
magnitude
of
the
business
have
present
new
problem
in
financing
which
the
present
banking
facility
seem
not
to
be
elastic
enough
to
overcome
the
constantly
increase
demand
for
our
product
particularly
the
passenger
car
and
commercial
vehicle
have
correspondingly
increase
the
difficulty
of
our
dealer
in
command
at
the
season
of
the
year
when
most
need
the
banking
accommodation
necessary
properly
to
handle
the
volume
of
business
which
their
ability
as
salesman
and
the
merit
of
our
product
as
merchandise
have
developed
this
fact
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
general
motor
corporation
should
lend
its
help
to
solve
these
problem
hence
the
creation
of
the
general
motor
acceptance
corporation
and
the
function
of
that
company
will
be
to
supplement
the
local
source
of
accommodation
to
such
extent
as
may
be
necessary
to
permit
the
full
development
of
our
dealer
business
a
few
word
about
the
difference
between
the
banking
and
the
manufacturing
mentality
at
that
time
the
banker
i
suppose
must
have
have
their
mind
on
barney
oldfield
and
sunday
outing
in
landau
along
the
boulevard
then
in
existence
that
be
they
thought
of
the
automobile
as
a
sport
and
a
pleasure
and
not
as
the
great
revolution
in
transportation
since
the
railway
they
believe
that
the
extension
of
consumer
credit
to
the
average
man
be
too
great
a
risk
furthermore
they
have
a
moral
objection
to
financing
a
luxury
believe
apparently
that
whatever
foster
consumption
must
discourage
thrift
consequently
automobile
be
sell
to
consumer
mainly
for
cash
distributor
and
dealer
too
have
to
develop
their
own
source
of
financing
largely
out
of
their
own
capital
supplement
with
customer
cash
deposit
and
bank
credit
this
phase
of
automobile
credit
work
all
right
in
the
early
day
when
distributor
have
wide
territorial
contract
and
be
able
to
make
their
sale
for
cash
it
be
not
too
difficult
for
them
to
cope
with
their
financial
requirement
as
the
business
grow
however
and
manufacturer
continued
to
require
cash
on
delivery
dealer
simply
do
not
have
the
fund
to
finance
inventory
not
to
mention
retail
installment
sale
thus
in
about
eight
year
before
the
automobile
industry
be
to
become
the
large
american
business
in
volume
of
sale
its
distribution
system
have
no
routine
retail
credit
structure
outside
of
normal
banking
channel
and
those
channel
be
pretty
narrow
the
automobile
industry
have
to
develop
this
credit
structure
itself
today
a
very
high
proportion
of
dealer
stock
be
finance
and
about
two
third
of
all
new
and
use
automobile
in
the
united
state
be
bought
at
retail
on
the
installment
plan
the
anxiety
of
those
who
doubt
the
soundness
of
consumer
credit
have
prove
groundless
in
the
case
of
gmac
the
retail
loss
ratio
on
installment
paper
from
to
be
approximately
one
third
of
percent
of
the
retail
volume
purchase
i
speak
of
the
gmac
ratio
and
not
of
any
loss
by
dealer
after
a
car
have
be
repossess
in
this
ratio
rise
to
one
half
of
percent
in
to
six
tenth
of
percent
and
in
to
five
sixth
of
percent
by
the
loss
ratio
be
equivalent
to
approximately
one
fifth
of
percent
thus
in
the
bad
of
the
depression
the
rate
of
loss
never
reach
percent
of
volume
a
remarkable
indication
of
the
safety
of
the
system
and
the
integrity
of
the
purchaser
when
we
first
undertook
the
systematic
financing
of
the
distribution
and
sale
of
general
motor
product
we
have
no
notion
that
this
system
of
credit
would
be
subject
to
a
test
as
severe
as
the
depression
or
that
it
could
survive
such
a
test
so
well
we
be
convince
however
that
if
we
exercise
ordinary
care
in
the
risk
assume
financing
wholesale
and
retail
distribution
and
sale
of
our
product
would
promote
a
sound
demand
for
automobile
which
lack
of
credit
be

the

gmac
s
basic
policy
be
formulate
and
refine
between
and
in
the
begin
we
have
two
primary
motif
to
establish
the
validity
of
the
system
and
to
crusade
for
reasonable
rate
for
the

we

we

interested

good

of
our
customer
and
in
protect
them
from
high
rate
the
risk
in
consumer
financing
center
around
default
repossession
and
the
use
car
market
hence
the
importance
of
the
down
payment
and
the
length
of
time
over
which
repayment
be
to
take
place
the
ability
of
the
purchaser
to
make
payment
and
the
need
in
the
credit
structure
of
the
repossess
car
s
be
worth
the
balance
due
to
the
dealer
as
an
endorser
of
the
purchaser
s
obligation
it
be
most
important
that
there
be
collateral
which
if
necessary
could
be
repossess
and
resold
at
a
fair
price
in
the
absence
of
such
collateral
the
financial
burden
on
the
dealer
be
very
heavy
we
be
encourage
by
a
study
of
consumer
credit
along
these
line
make
over
a
period
of
year
under
our
sponsorship
by
the
eminent
economist
professor
e
r
a
seligman
his
two
volume
work
the
economics
of
instalment
sell
the
culmination
of
this
study
publish
in
become
a
standard
work
in
the
field
it
have
a
strong
influence
i
believe
in
bring
about
an
acceptance
of
installment
sell
among
banker
businessmen
and
the
public
professor
seligman
drew
some
conclusion
that
be
accepted
as
axiomatic
today
but
then
be
novel
installment
credit
he
say
not
only
strengthens
the
motive
to
save
but
increase
the
individual
s
ability
to
do
so
it
not
only
advance
the
time
of
demand
but
by
interaction
with
the
economy
actually
increase
purchasing
power
it
both
stabilizes
and
increase
production
so
the
cost
of
financing
be
outweigh
by
the
advantage
gain
one
early
question
we
have
to
answer
be
how
much
of
the
financial
burden
the
dealer
should
carry
we
have
little
experience
by
which
to
gauge
the
magnitude
of
the
risk
which
dealer
would
actually
assume
under
their
unrestricted
endorsement
of
the
purchaser
s
obligation
in
addition
to
the
risk
of
resale
loss
on
repossess
collateral
there
be
also
the
hazard
that
the
collateral
the
car
itself
might
disappear
through
conversion
by
the
purchaser
or
confiscation
by
the
government
or
become
worthless
through
total
or
partial
collision
loss
in
as
a
result
of
a
thorough
study
by
a
l
deane
then
a
vice
president
of
gmac
a
modification
be
adopt
which
limited
the
risk
on
the
part
of
the
dealer
under
this
revise
plan
gmac
agree
to
absorb
any
loss
on
retail
transaction
if
the
collateral
could
not
be
return
to
the
dealer
in
reasonable
condition
within
ninety
day
after
the
first
default
of
the
customer
far
it
provide
that
a
certain
percentage
of
the
gmac
finance
charge
would
be
place
to
the
credit
of
the
dealer
to
establish
a
reserve
fund
against
which
any
loss
on
the
sale
of
repossession
could
be
offset
thus
to
a
large
extent
the
profit
of
the
dealer
on
all
sale
be
freed
from
the

of

insurance
protection
against
fire
theft
and
collision
hazard

at
the

time

the
organization
of
another

this
company
offer
insurance
to
customer
who
request
it
against
physical
damage
to
the
car
not
against
such
risk
as
public
liability
and
property
damage
this
be
important
to
the
dealer
since
company
insure
automobile
be
in
those
day
highly
selective
and
the
purchaser
could
not
always
get
the
insurance
that
be
often
a
prerequisite
to
financing
the
idea
of

company
offering
physical

insurance
become
broadly
accepted
with
some
modification
as
a
standard
pattern
for

relation
with

today
the
company
that

physical

be

insurance
corporation
a
subsidiary
of
gmac
at
that
time
some
finance
company
relieve
the
dealer
from
responsibility
for
the
unpaid
balance
of
the
retail
credit
transaction
when
the
customer
default
this
nonrecourse
system
have
the
disadvantage
of
reduce
the
dealer
s
interest
in
check
the
soundness
of
the
original
credit
also
it
be
more
expensive
to
operate
for
a
number
of
obvious
reason
not
the
least
of
these
be
the
fact
that
the
finance
company
be
not
in
a
position
to
sell
repossession
at
as
good
price
as
a
franchise
dealer
the
purchaser
eventually
paid
for
the
additional
cost
involve
through
a
high
finance
charge
at
first
gmac
chose
not
to
follow
the
so
call
nonrecourse
route
there
be
a
number
of
reason
for
this
among
them
be
this
matter
of
cost
to
the
consumer
gmac
felt
it
undesirable
to
relieve
the
dealer
of
all
obligation
on
retail
installment
transaction
it
felt
that
its
plan
with
its
guaranty
of
the
return
of
the
collateral
would
provide
the
necessary
protection
to
the
dealer
at
the
low
cost
to
the
purchaser
experience
have
prove
this
to
be
correct
however
because
of
competitive
pressure
gmac
add
a
nonrecourse
plan
to
its
service
the
finance
charge
itself
be
an
important
element
of
the
cost
of
a
car
throughout
the
year
both
general
motor
and
gmac
have
emphasize
this
fact
gmac
have
point
out
that
additional
and
unnecessary
cost
be
incur
by
the
purchaser
if
the
repayment
time
be
unnecessarily
long
and
the
down
payment
low
than
be
justified
gmac
have
campaign
against
excessive
financing
charge
i
think
it
fair
to
say
it
take
the
leadership
in
this
matter
the
man
whose
name
be
associate
with
gmac
more
than
anyone
else
s
be
john
j
schumann

who
join
gmac
in
and
be
its
president
for
twenty
five
year
from
to
he
be
a
strong
leader
for
sound
practice
and
he
put
the
stamp
of
his
personality
on
the
organization
in
uncompromising
term
he
advanced
policy
and

that
be

policy
i
write

in

of
an
equitable
minimum
be
not
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the

the
end
that
the

take
some
interest
turn
in
this
connection
in
gmac
announce
the
so

this
told
the
public
that
they
could
get

the
initial

the
actual

on
the

advanced
calculate
on
a
true

basis
be
of
course
high
but
gmac
follow
the
convention
and
advertised
it
gmac
believe
that
the
plan
give
the
customer
a
convenient
publicly
know
yardstick
for
measure
his
actual
finance
charge
competition
do
not
like
the
gmac
plan
there
be
complaint
to
the
federal
trade
commission
that
this
be
an
unfair
trade
practice
which
mislead
the
public
into
believe
that
the
state
finance
charge
be
a
simple
interest
rate
i
thought
it
be
make
perfectly
clear
when
we
say
in
the
advertising
that
the
be
a
multiplier
i
e
not
an
interest
rate
but
the
commission
rule
that
gmac
must
discontinue
use
the
term
in
my
opinion
to
the
advantage
of
high
rate
finance
company
and
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
consumer
in
the
government
attack
general

gmac
charge
that

general

deny
that
it

at
a

conduct
by

during
this

discuss
at
some
length
some
felt
that
gmac
should
be
dispose
of
by
general

i
be
interested
in
the
conclusion
in
the
report
of
the
staff
of
the
subcommittee
which
state
that
general

have
have
a
competitive
advantage
over
other
manufacturer
of
car
because
it
have
own
a
sale
finance
company
and
that
it
should
be
force
to
divest
itself
of
this
activity
but
why
plenty
of
money
be
available
to
other
seller
of
car
the
advantage
gmac
offer
to
general

be
a
sympathetic
relationship
equitable
to
the

and
i
be
glad
to
say
that
in
provide
an
economical
service
to
consumer
and
dealer
it
have
built
a
profitable
business
for

many
others
in
more

less
similar
type

recognize
the
value
of

the
suggestion
that

any

should
be
deprive
of
a
sale
and
distribution
tool
operate
in
the
interest
of
the
consumer
strike
me
as
very
unusual
in
our
scheme
of
thing
to
me
it
would
seem
that
it
can
stem
only
from
those
element
which
attack
for
their
own
gain
the
earlier
farsighted
and
public
mind
activity
of
gmac
and
the
policy
that
the
public
should

treat
fairly
with
respect
to
service
and
the
cost
of
such

i
subscribe
to
the
simple
truth
express
by
charles
g
stradella
then
president
of
gmac
to
the
subcommittee
in
he
say
in
its
association
with
general
motor
corp
gmac
may
have
advantage
in
all
probability
there
be
dealer
who
be
influence
by
the
assurance
of
continuity
of
service
community
of
interest
fair
treatment
et
cetera
which
go
with
the
association
lender
to
gmac
be
influence
by
the
assurance
of
adequate
capitalization
sound
management
and
conservative
financial
policy
and
practice
on
the
other
hand
unless
these
advantage
be
support
by
the
record
of
gmac
and
its
aggressive
pursuance
of
sound
practice
the
association
would
do
it
little
good
in
the
eye
of
the
party
concerned
gmac
help
to
bring
consumer
financing
into
be
in
the
early
day
it
have
have
an
influence
on
keep
the
term
of
down
payment
and
time
span
on
a
reasonably
conservative
basis
its
disciplinary
influence
in
the
direction
of
reasonable
rate
to
the
customer
be
gradually
be
take
over
by
legislation
more
than
half
the
state
now
set
maximum
rate
by
state
law
i
believe
the
time
be
not
far
off
when
all
the
state
will
have
rate
legislation
in
my
personal
opinion
this
be
the
right
procedure
provide
the
state
set
reasonably
low
rate
ceiling
in
the
consumer
s
interest
while
legislation
may
be
desirable
to
control
effectively
the
maximum
charge
which
the
public
must
pay
for
the
privilege
of
installment
credit
i
have
never
felt
that
other
condition
of
the
transaction
between
the
dealer
and
the
purchaser
such
as
down
payment
and
length
of
time
should
be
regulate
except
in
the
case
of
national
emergency
this
do
not
mean
that
i
have
not
be
aware
along
with
others
of
the
danger
of
overexpansion
of
consumer
credit
the
record
be
clear
that
gmac
have
be
continually
interested
in
discourage
unduly
small
down
payment
and
in
keep
the
length
of
term
within
reasonable
limit
i
think
i
might
add
that
conservative
financing
be
essential
to
the
health
of
the
automobile
industry
the
man
who
pay
too
little
down
and
take
too
long
to
pay
will
have
no
equity
with
which
to
come
back
soon
for
a
new
car
in
late
considerable
concern
be
express
in
many
quarter
that
consumer
credit
might
have
be
overexpanded
and
that
down
payment
and
term
control
might
have
become
too
loose
in
my
opinion
the
fact
do
not
warrant
such
conclusion
there
be
agitation
for
legislation
to
control
consumer
credit
in
order
to
check
inflation
in
his
economic
report
of
january
the
president
of
the
united
state
raise
the
question
whether
permanent
authority
for
standby
control
of
consumer
credit
by
some
governmental
agency
would
be
a
useful
adjunct
to
other
stabilize
measure
the
study
of
this
question
be
assign
by
the
president
through
the
council
of
economic
adviser
to
the
board
of
governor
of
the
federal
reserve
system
we
with
many
other
respond
to
the
questionnaire
issue
during
the
course
of
the
study
and
state
the
reason
for
our
belief
that
permanent
standby
control
to
be
operate
by
a
government
agency
be
unnecessary
that
generally
the
control
of
consumer
credit
can
safely
be
left
in
the
hand
of
consumer
and
lender
until
congress
identifies
specific
circumstance
which
dictate
otherwise
or
a
national
emergency
call
for
presidential
action
a
statement
of
the
federal
reserve
board
release
in
found
among
other
thing
that
fluctuation
in
consumer
installment
credit
have
be
generally
within
limit
that
could
be
tolerate
in
a
rapidly
grow
and
dynamic
economy
that
a
special
peacetime
authority
to
regulate
consumer
installment
credit
be
not
now
advisable
and
that
the
broad
public
interest
be
well
serve
if
potentially
unstabilizing
credit
development
be
restrain
by
the
use
of
general
monetary
measure
and
the
application
of
sound
public
and
private
fiscal
policy
i
agree
with
these
idea
so
far
as
gmac
be
concerned
i
would
say
in
brief
that
it
offer
a
service
related
to
the
product
and
in
the
interest
of
the
consumer
the
advantage
to
the
customer
the
dealer
and
the
corporation
seem
obvious
to
me

look
back
on
the

of

during
the

four
decade
one
might
regard
our
progress
overseas
as
a
kind
of
natural
and
inevitable
extension
of
our
progress
in
this
country
in
reality
there
be
nothing
at
all
inevitable
about
it
i
have
review
a
number
of
document
deal
with
the
formulation
in
past
year
of
an
overseas
policy
in
general
motor
the
document
have
revive
in
my
mind
the
long
and
complex
history
of
that
policy
and
they
have
also
remind
me
of
the
difficult
decision
on
which
our
progress
turn
for
the
overseas
market
be
no
mere
extension
of
the
united
state
market
in
building
up
our
overseas
operation
division
we
be
oblige
almost
at
the
outset
to
confront
some
large
basic
question
we
have
to
decide
whether
and
to
what
extent
there
be
a
market
abroad
for
the
american
car
and
if
so
which
american
car
offer
the
best
growth
prospect
we
have
to
determine
whether
we
want
to
be
exporter
or
overseas
producer
when
it
become
clear
that
we
have
to
engage
in
some
production
abroad
the
next
question
be
whether
to
build
up
our
own
company
or
to
buy
and
develop
exist
one
we
have
to
devise
some
mean
of
living
with
restrictive
regulation
and
duty
we
have
to
work
out
a
special
form
of
organization
that
would
be
suitable
overseas
all
of
these
problem
be
consider
fully
within
the
corporation
for
a
period
of
several
year
in
the
s
when
the
basic
policy
be
establish
today
general

participates
in
the
overseas
market
in
two
way
as
an
exporter
of
american
car

and
as
a

gropings
toward
the

a

for

we
be
soon
make
acutely
aware
of
the
problem
engender
by
economic
nationalism
abroad
from
the
early
day
of
the
automobile

dollar
poor
nation

impose
high
tariff
and
severe
quota
upon
the
import
of
american
car
and
other
american
product
this
nationalism
have
lead
many
foreign
nation
to
press
for
production
at
home
even
when
the
home
market
appear
too
small
to
sustain
an
efficient
integrate
automobile
industry
in
the
entire
overseas

absorbed
about

about
half
of

be

in

industrial
nation

great
britain
france
germany
and
italy
while
this
western
european
market
be
the
richest
it
be
also
the
most
difficult
to
penetrate
for
these
four
country
as
a
group
produce
about
three
quarter
of
the

they
absorbed
and
they
be
determine
to
exclude
effective
american
competition
the
other
half
of
the
overseas
market
consist
of
relatively
undeveloped
nation
scatter
over
the
face
of
the
globe
in
this
second
market
american
producer
generally
have
free
access
although
we
dealt
with
each
country
as
a
separate
proposition
a
pattern
of
sort
begin
to
emerge
in
our
overseas
operation
during
the
s
we
gradually
perceive
that
two
main
kind
of
marketing
situation
predominate
abroad
the
first
of
these
situation
be
largely
confine
to
western
europe
superficially
our
export
business
to
the
continent
appear
to
be
thrive
but
it
become
increasingly
clear
that
in
the
long
run
our
european
export
and
distribution
system
be
threaten
by
economic
nationalism
we
continued
to
press
our
export
business
there
as
best
we
could
and
we
back
up
this
position
by
building
assembly
plant
in
several
european
country
the
assembly
plant
make
it
possible
for
us
to
identify
ourselves
more
closely
with
the
local
economy
by
utilize
local
management
and
labor
moreover
as
we
gain
experience
with
local
supply
condition
we
make
increase
use
of
local
source
for
such
item
as
tire
glass
upholstery
and
the
like
in
other
word
we
could
ship
unassembled
car
from
the
united
state
without
these
item
and
purchase
and
install
them
locally
if
the
economics
justified
this
have
another
advantage
compare
with
export
complete
car
in
that
it
result
in
low
duty
payment
today
american
automobile
be
assemble
by

in
belgium
denmark
and
switzerland
but
the
conviction
grow
that
our
future
in
europe
lay
in
produce
car
there
the
case
for
european
production
be
state
vigorously
and
insistently
by
james
d

who
be

however
the
executive
committee
of
the

of
which
i
be

remain
doubtful
about
the
wisdom
of
our
become
producer
abroad
until
close
to
the
end
of
the
s
a
different
kind
of
marketing
situation
prevail
in
large
area
of
the
world
outside
of
europe
area
which
be
not
heavily
industrialize
no
manufacturing
operation
would
be
feasible
in
these
area
for
many
year
accordingly
our
effort
there
have
to
be
primarily
in
export
with
both
sup
and
ckd
shipment
play
a
role
our
assembly
operation
outside
of
europe
today
be
in
the
republic
of
south
africa
peru
mexico
venezuela
australia
new
zealand
and
uruguay
though
our
unit
sale
overseas
have
grown
more
than
eight
time
since
i
think
it
be
fair
to
state
that
the
character
of
the
operation
and
our
basic
overseas
marketing
strategy
be
both
establish
in
the
twenty
our
first
thought
about
secure
a
european
production
base
concerned
the
citro
n
company
in
france
negotiation
for
the
acquisition
of
a
half
interest
in
citro
n
consume
several
week
during
the
summer
and
early
fall
of
in
that
year
as
mention
earlier
mr
durant
sent
a
group
of
general
motor
executive
abroad
to
make
a
study
of
the
european
automobile
industry
and
it
be
this
group
consist
of
mr
haskell
as
chairman
mr
kettering
mr
mott
mr
chrysler
mr
champion
and
myself
that
do
the
actual
negotiate
andr
citro
n
be
an
aggressive
imaginative
businessman
and
as
it
happen
he
be
interested
in
sell
his
company
at
the
end
of
our
stay
in
france
we
be
still
uncertain
about
the
wisdom
of
acquire
the
property
i
recall
that
the
night
before
we
be
due
to
sail
back
we
sat
up
until
early
in
the
morning
in
a
room
in
the
hotel
crillon
argue
at
great
length
about
the
issue
in
a
general
way
we
be
for
the
acquisition
but
there
be
some
specific
difficulty
for
one
thing
the
french
government
do
not
like
the
idea
of
american
interest
take
over
an
enterprise
that
have
contribute
importantly
to
the
war
effort
for
another
the
production
facility
do
not
appeal
to
us
and
it
be
clear
that
if
we
undertook
to
run
citro
n
an
investment
run
far
beyond
the
initial
cost
would
be
require
furthermore
the
company
s
management
then
be
not
entirely
adequate
at
one
point
that
even
we
discuss
a
proposal
that
either
mr
chrysler
or
myself
move
to
france
and
run
the
company
i
be
personally
not
interested
in
this
proposition
and
i
argue
that
in
general
our
own
management
at
home
be
not
strong
enough
to
supply
the
top
men
that
would
be
need
to
operate
citro
n
i
sometimes
wonder
just
how
different
the
history
of
the
industry
would
have
be
if
either
mr
chrysler
or
i
have
offer
to
operate
citro
n
for
general
motor
in
those
day
when
the
industry
be
new
and
expand
explosively
its
future
be
shape
by
a
small
number
of
individual
who
take
lead
position
as
often
as
not
the
capital
go
to
these
men
rather
than
the
men
to
the
capital
at
any
rate
a
few
hour
before
we
be
due
to
sail
we
decide
not
to
buy
citro
n
the
company
be
later
take
over
by
the
michelin
company
which
do
very
well
with
it
general
motor
never
have
establish
an
automobile
produce
company
in
france
somehow
the
time
and
circumstance
have
never
seem
quite
right
however
we
do
have
a
large
frigidaire
operation
in
france
and
we
be
an
important
manufacturer
there
of
spark
plug
and
some
other
component
for
the
automobile
industry
our
next
effort
to
secure
a
manufacturing
position
abroad
be
make
in
england
the
future
of
american

in
the
british

since

be
inhibit
by
these
circumstance
british
manufacturer
face
some
difficulty
of
their
own
by
the
mid
twenty
a
large
number
of
british
producer
have
come
into
the
automobile
industry
but
their
combine
volume
amount
to
only
about

and
truck
split
up
into
a
large
number
of
design
and
price
level
the
british

therefore
lack
many
of

and
their

be
chronically
depressed

then
we

to

the

no

not
recapitulate
here
all
the
obstacle
which
arose
in
the
course
of
negotiation
except
to
say
that
the
principal
disagreement
concerned
the
manner
in
which
austin
value
its
asset
on
september
mr
mooney
cable
me
that
our
offer
have
be
withdrawn
as
i
recall
the
incident
i
be
actually
relieve
to
hear
this
news
for
it
seem
to
me
that
austin
have
largely
the
same
disadvantage
that
have
bother
me
about
citro
n
six
year
earlier
its
physical
plant
then
be
in
poor
condition
and
its
management
be
weak
and
i
still
have
some
doubt
whether
our
own
management
be
strong
enough
to
make
up
for
austin
s
deficiency
indeed
the
continued
dilution
of
our
management
strength
as
we
expand
overseas
and
at
home
be
a
problem
all
during
the
s
the
reader
may
wonder
why
in
these
circumstance
i
have
ever
authorize
our
team
in
england
to
close
the
austin
deal
in
the
first
place
the
answer
essentially
be
that
i
always
try
to
run
general
motor
by
a
policy
of
conciliation
rather
than
coercion
and
when
a
majority
be
oppose
to
my
think
i
be
often
dispose
to
give
way
i
might
add
that
the
top
officer
of
general
motor
who
be
involve
in
this
situation
be
men
of
unusual
talent
and
strong
conviction
and
as
president
i
felt
i
should
respect
their
judgment
but
notice
in
my
cable
to
our
group
in
england
that
i
place
the
responsibility
for
the
deal
squarely
on
their
shoulder
they
would
have
to
validate
it
soon
after
the
austin
deal
fell
through
we
enter
into
negotiation
to
purchase
vauxhall
motor
ltd
a
much
small
concern
in
england
this
acquisition
in
the
latter
part
of
be
a
much
less
controversial
matter
in
general
motor
vauxhall
manufacture
a
relatively
high
price
car
roughly
comparable
in
size
to
our
buick
and
have
an
annual
volume
of
only
about
unit
it
be
in
no
sense
a
substitute
for
austin
indeed
i
look
on
it
only
as
a
kind
of
experiment
in
overseas
manufacturing
the
experiment
seem
appeal
however
and
the
investment
require
of
us
be
only
vauxhall
lose
money
in
the
first
few
year
after
we
take
it
over
and
it
gradually
become
clear
to
us
that
we
would
have
to
develop
a
small
car
if
we
hop
to
capture
a
much
large
share
of
the
british
market
mr
mooney
be
eager
to
begin
this
development
as
rapidly
as
possible
he
also
saw
vauxhall
as
a
precedent
for
expansion
of
our
production
operation
in
other
country
my
own
feeling
about
the
future
of
our
overseas
operation
be
much
less
clear
than
his
at
this
time
and
in
general
i
take
the
line
in
the
next
few
year
that
we
should
move
slowly
and
cautiously
until
we
have
work
out
a
clear
policy
for
overseas
operation
the
peculiar
fact
be
that
although
we
have
make
the
gesture
i
have
described
toward
produce
abroad
and
have
take
on
vauxhall
the
executive
committee
have
not
yet
crystallize
an
overseas
policy
the
decisive
debate
on
this
subject
in
the
corporation
begin
in
in
january
while
i
be
still
concerned
with
keep
our
position
flexible
i
offer
to
the
executive
committee
a
preliminary
formulation
as
follow
that
recognize
the
desirability
of
employ
additional
capital
for
the
purpose
of
increase
the
corporation
s
profit
and
develop
its
business
the
executive
committee
will
consider
favorably
as
to
principle
the
employment
of
capital
for
manufacturing
purpose
in
overseas
manufacturing
country
either
in
the
form
of
employment
of
such
capital
on
its
own
account
or
through
association
with
foreign
manufacturer
thus
i
express
my
opinion
as
to
the
desirability
of
overseas
manufacturing
in
principle
this
view
of
mine
be
consider
at
length
by
the
executive
committee
on
january
and
order
file
without
any
concrete
action
it
be
clear
that
we
be
still
in
search
of
a
policy
by
this
time
the
broad
policy
issue
have
come
to
center
on
several
specific
issue
should
we
expand
vauxhall
or
should
we
write
it
off
as
a
bad
investment
be
it
really
necessary
to
manufacture
in
europe
or
could
a
modify
chevrolet
export
from
the
united
state
compete
with
european
car
in
the
european
market
we
be
especially
uncertain
what
to
do
in
germany
if
we
decide
to
produce
there
should
we
expand
our
berlin
assembly
plant
into
a
manufacturing
operation
or
should
we
affiliate
with
some
other
producer
our
overseas
operation
men
especially
mr
mooney
be
inclined
to
favor
expansion
of
exist
facility
while
i
rather
prefer
affiliation
with
a
german
producer
there
be
certainly
substantial
reason
for
support
either
approach
the
question
of
manufacturing
abroad
be
discuss
in
the
executive
committee
again
on
march
and
still
again
on
april
at
the
latter
meeting
we
discuss
particularly
the
question
whether
we
should
manufacture
a
small
car
in
england
and
germany
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
question
be
discuss
by
the
executive
committee
through
practically
the
entire
year
of
there
be
a
strong
sentiment
that
our
export
organization
should
be
limited
to
sell
american
product
abroad
and
should
not
get
into
overseas
manufacture
meanwhile
i
be
interested
in
a
suggestion
that
we
create
in
the
united
state
an
organization
to
design
a
modify
small
bore
chevrolet
a
car
that
would
escape
the
heavy
horsepower
tax
in
england
and
germany
i
felt
that
if
this
be
do
it
might
prove
unnecessary
to
develop
a
new
small
car
at
vauxhall
or
to
go
into
production
in
germany
or
if
it
should
become
necessary
to
produce
such
a
car
abroad
we
would
at
least
have
a
design
available
in
any
case
i
want
the
fact
establish
to
everyone
s
satisfaction
before
proceed
far
in
either
country
at
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
on
june
i
urge
that
each
member
talk
to
mr
mooney
individually
in
the
hope
that
these
discussion
might
clarify
our
think
in
july
mr
mooney
address
a
long
memorandum
to
me
detail
his
point
of
view
on
all
the
issue
a
few
week
later
i
conveyed
this
memorandum
to
the
executive
committee
together
with
my
own
comment
on
the
point
raise
by
mr
mooney
perhaps
the
simplest
way
of
describe
the
contend
view
and
of
re
create
some
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
discussion
be
to
quote
some
excerpt
from
his
memorandum
one
of
the
first
point
make
by
mr
mooney
concerned
the
desirability
of
continue
expansion
by
the
export
company
he
point
out
that
over
the
past
five
year
the
export
division
have
increase
its
dollar
volume
from
to
our
general
problem
be
to
raise
our
total
dollar
volume
in
export
from
its
present
level
of
to
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
to
provide
a
mean
that
will
maintain
a
continue
increase
into
the
future
mr
mooney
point
out
far
that
the
low
price
product
that
we
can
offer
for
sale
in
the
world
market
today
which
be
the
chevrolet
cost
the
user
approximately
more
than
it
do
the
user
in
the
united
state
and
the
user
in
the
world
market
have
approximately
only
of
the
money
of
the
united
state
user
to
pay
for
it
therefore
the
chevrolet
when
put
down
in
world
market
be
not
in
the
large
volume
area
and
be
in
a
relatively
high
price
class
mr
mooney
make
his
case
for
the
expansion
of
vauxhall
along
these
line
we
have
already
start
on
a
manufacturing
program
which
we
propose
to
expand
by
add
another
car
model
we
have
a
large
and
grow
distribution
system
in
england
and
an
investment
in
the
vauxhall
plant
that
have
to
be
safeguard
the
fact
that
the
british
empire
cover
percent
of
the
world
market
outside
of
the
united
state
and
canada
be
important
in
the
consideration
of
england
as
a
source
for
export
market
the
discussion
then
turn
to
the
question
of
our
future
dealing
in
germany
on
which
mr
mooney
make
his
case
with
the
follow
salient
point
we
already
have
an
establish
organization
in
the
form
of
the
general
motor
assembly
plant
in
berlin
we
propose
to
manufacture
a
car
model
at
this
plant
rather
than
acquire
an
interest
in
the
opel
automobile
company
since
the
automobile
industry
in
germany
be
in
its
formative
state
the
time
be
right
to
establish
a
successful
manufacturing
operation
our
exist
investment
have
to
be
safeguard
not
only
be
the
domestic
german
market
potentially
large
but
germany
be
also
in
a
good
position
to
export
to
neighbor
country
i
agree
with
some
of
his
main
point
and
on
some
others
i
be
as
i
have
already
suggest
frankly
undecided
the
one
clear
point
of
disagreement
between
myself
and
mr
mooney
concerned
an
aspect
of
what
our
policy
should
be
in
germany
i
view
the
case
there
something
like
this
if
the
idea
be
to
make
a
very
small
car
much
small
than
the
chevrolet
assume
that
be
an
economic
thing
to
do
then
we
might
be
well
off
deal
directly
with
opel
i
felt
that
we
would
get
off
to
a
well
start
that
way
than
we
would
by
try
to
compete
on
our
own
in
a
country
with
which
we
be
largely
unfamiliar
during
the
follow
six
month
our
policy
in
germany
be
finally
establish
in
october
i
make
an
inspection
trip
to
europe
accompany
by
john
thomas
smith
who
be
general
counsel
of
general
motor
and
charles
t
fisher
we
visit
our
export
and
assembly
operation
throughout
europe
and
also
visit
adam
opel
a
g
my
prior
interest
in
acquire
opel
be
stimulate
by
this
visit
so
much
so
that
i
negotiate
an
option
for
general
motor
to
buy
opel
the
option
be
to
expire
on
april
and
we
agree
subject
to
far
examination
of
the
company
that
we
would
pay
about
million
if
we
bought
it
i
report
this
arrangement
to
the
executive
committee
on
november
the
committee
be
generally
sympathetic
to
the
idea
of
buying
opel
and
it
be
agree
that
we
should
look
far
into
the
property
at
a
committee
meeting
on
november
we
decide
to
appoint
a
study
group
to
do
just
that
the
group
finally
agree
upon
consist
of
mr
smith
who
be
to
be
in
charge
together
with
albert
bradley
general
assistant
treasurer
c
b
durham
the
head
of
manufacturing
at
buick
and
e
k
wennerlund
who
be
an
expert
on
factory
arrangement
and
flow
of
material
before
the
group
sail
i
give
mr
smith
a
formal
memorandum
outline
the
situation
as
i
saw
it
i
ask
him
to
bear
these
question
in
mind
must
we
not
look
forward
to
the
time
when
restriction
will
be
place
upon
us
and
where
exportation
of
american
car
will
he
confine
to
the
high
price
car
and
that
the
real
market
from
the
standpoint
of
volume
will
to
a
large
extent
go
to
locally
make
car
and
through
evolution
correspond
influence
be
bound
to
be
felt
on
the
high
price
car
be
there
not
a
tremendous
opportunity
both
on
the
continent
in
england
and
overseas
for
the
production
of
a
car
have
less
of
the
element
of
luxury
than
the
present
chevrolet
provide
it
be
so
design
and
developed
that
it
can
be
sell
at
a
price
sufficiently
low
than
the
present
chevrolet
be
it
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
assume
the
second
point
above
be
correct
that
even
if
not
now
through
the
development
of
the
german
industry
the
point
will
soon
be
reach
when
the
difference
in
cost
of
manufacture
will
be
less
than
the
tariff
and
import
charge
especially
write
into
the
picture
the
handicap
of
the
h
p
tax
in
which
event
importation
abroad
will
be
more
and
more
limited
be
there
not
an
opportunity
for
the
corporation
to
protect
its
large
organization
large
volume
and
substantially
large
profit
accrue
to
it
through
its
continental
and
english
operation
and
to
some
extent
afford
protection
to
its
overseas
business
elsewhere
by
invest
capital
in
manufacturing
abroad
and
make
a
substantial
return
on
that
additional
capital
i
conclude
with
these
general
admonition
i
want
particularly
to
say
to
the
member
of
the
committee
individually
and
to
you
as
chairman
that
you
should
take
nothing
for
grant
every
point
should
be
study
and
approach
with
an
open
mind
without
prejudice
and
with
the
sole
purpose
of
get
the
fact
wherever
they
may
lead
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
be
one
of
the
most
important
step
from
the
standpoint
of
capital
investment
and
expansion
of
the
organization
that
the
corporation
have
make
since
the
present
management
have
be
connect
with
its
administrative
side
the
advent
of
general
motor
into
the
manufacturing
situation
abroad
be
bound
to
stir
up
a
great
deal
of
discussion
both
within
industrial
circle
as
well
as
within
government
circle
therefore
our
reputation
for
do
a
constructive
thing
and
do
it
in
a
constructive
way
be
in
the
balance
the
committee
have
a
tremendous
responsibility
not
only
to
itself
but
to
the
whole
corporation
in
analyze
the
problem
the
study

about
the
st
of
january
and
on
the

brought
up
the

the

the

to

at
low
cost
it
follow
that
to
be
successful
in
the

you
have
to

be
reasonable
for
us
to
build

a

would
require
at

within

ground
up
the

would
give
general
motor
the
opel

organization

we
would
acquire
a
german
background
instead
of
have
to
operate
as
foreigner
it
be
clear
to
mr
fisher
and
myself
that
the
recommendation
of
the
study
group
be
adequately
support
by
the
comprehensive
report
we
therefore
decide
to
approve
the

of

proceed
to

sselsheim
the

in

we
conclude
an
agreement
which
be
only
slightly
different
from
that
contemplate
at
the
time
i
have
secure
the
option
the
final
agreement
provide
that
we
receive
an

at
a
cost
of
in
addition
we
receive
an
option
to
buy
the
remain
percent
for
and
the
opel
family
receive
a
put
which
entitle
it
to
sell
the

option
in

thus
come
into

of

a

at
an

cost
of
though
opel
be
a
well
run
company
it
be
not
without
management
problem
especially
at
the
top
policy
level
the
company
also
have
a
problem
as
we
saw
it
with
its
dealer
many
of
them
have
set
up
rather
elaborate
machine
shop
of
their
own
in
which
spare
part
could
be
produce
adam
opel
a
g
have
not
developed
a
system
of
interchangeable
part
when
a
customer
need
a
spare
part
the
distributor
have
to
make
the
part
to
fit
that
particular
car
or
if
he
get
a
part
from
the
factory
he
would
have
to
refit
it
that
do
not
make
sense
to
an
american
producer
use
to
a
system
of
mass
production
base
on
interchangeable
part
and
we
set
out
to
correct
this
the
purchase
of
opel
give
us
a
strong
position
in
germany
the
company
s
output
of
about
car
and
truck
be
small
by
american
standard
but
we
make
no
secret
of
our
plan
for
a
dramatic
expansion
soon
after
the
deal
have
be
complete
geheimrat
wilhelm
von
opel
the
company
president
brought
all
its
dealer
and
distributor
together
at
a
big
meeting
in
frankfurt
altogether
some
five
or
six
hundred
of
them
come
from
germany
and
from
nearby
country
to
which
opel
be
export
i
spoke
to
the
group
about
the
policy
of
general
motor
i
observe
to
them
that
while
germany
be
a
highly
industrialize
country
its
automobile
production
be
very
low
by
american
standard
and
that
i
anticipate
opel
production
might
one
day
run
as
high
as
vehicle
a
year
when
the
statement
be
translate
into
german
it
be
receive
with
a
good
deal
of
derision
i
be
view
as
another
impractical
visionary
american
yet
as
i
write
this
the
capacity
have
be
brought
up
to
vehicle
soon
after
we
take
over
opel
we
instal
i
j
reuter
as
manage
director
mr
reuter
have
be
general
manager
of
our
old
division
he
be
an
operating
executive
who
combine
a
good
engineering
background
with
production
and
sale
experience
he
be
also
of
german
extraction
and
spoke
the
language
with
a
fair
degree
of
fluency
it
take
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
on
my
part
to
get
mr
reuter
to
accept
the
assignment
but
he
finally
yield
and
in
september
he
and
i
and
several
men
whom
we
have
chosen
to
be
his
assistant
make
a
trip
to
r
sselsheim
and
formally
inaugurate
his
regime
while
my
own
point
of
view
prevail
in
general
in
our
development
of
a
policy
for
germany
mr
mooney
s
recommendation
be
finally
adopt
in
england
it
be
clear
by
that
we
either
have
to
build
up
vauxhall
or
else
give
up
on
the
english
market
mr
mooney
be
successful
in
advocate
that
vauxhall
should
develop
a
small
car
in
a
low
price
six
cylinder
model
be
add
the
year
be
also
notable
for
the
fact
that
vauxhall
first
enter
the
commercial
vehicle
market
the
company
gain
a
strong
position
in
the
truck
business
but
its
position
in
the
passenger
car
business
remain
disappoint
i
therefore
appoint
a
committee
early
in
to
proceed
to
england
to
make
a
report
and
submit
recommendation
for
a
product
program
this
committee
under
the
chairmanship
of
albert
bradley
then
vice
president
of
finance
recommend
that
vauxhall
discontinue
its
current
passenger
car
line
and
then
manufacture
and
sell
a
small
and
lighter
six
cylinder
passenger
car
to
be
follow
at
a
later
date
by
a
four
cylinder
line
the
new
light
six
be
introduce
in
and
the
low
horsepower
four
in
the
committee
s
recommendation
be
of
last
significance
for
vauxhall
at
present
vauxhall
s
capacity
be
be
expand
to
passenger
car
and
truck
on
an
annual
basis
in
acquire
opel
and
building
up
vauxhall
general
motor
underwent
an
important
change
it
be
transform
from
a
domestic
to
an
international
manufacturer
prepared
to
seek
market
for
its
product
wherever
they
exist
and
to
support
these
market
with
manufacturing
and
assembly
facility
and
organization
where
the
circumstance
justified
such
a
course
a
high
level
determination
of
policy
have
be
establish
we
be
fortunate
in
acquire
vauxhall
and
opel
during
the
late
twenty
for
when
the
great
world
wide
depression
begin
in
our
export
business
go
into
a
sudden
steep
decline
as
do
that
of
other
american
producer
general
motor
export
from
the
united
state
and
canada
go
from
vehicle
in
to
only
in
thereafter
they
begin
to
grow
again
but
the
growth
in
our
overseas
production
be
more
rapid
still
in
for
the
first
time
the
vauxhall
and
opel
sale
be
great
than
the
sale
abroad
of
general
motor
american
make
vehicle
the
big
prewar
year
for
all
overseas
operation
domestic
and
foreign
production
be
in
that
year
we
export
vehicle
from
the
united
state
and
canada
and
sell
vehicle
manufacture
abroad
the
future
of
our
entire
overseas
operation
be
of
course
very
much
in
doubt
after
world
war
ii
broke
out
assume
the
ultimate
defeat
of
the
axis
power
it
be
still
hard
to
say
with
any
certainty
just
what
political
and
economic
condition
would
prevail
in
much
of
the
world
in
at
my
suggestion
we
set
up
a
post
war
planning
policy
group
inside
the
corporation
and
entrust
it
with
the
heavy
responsibility
of
make
some
estimate
of
the
future
political
shape
of
the
world
and
also
of
recommend
future
general
motor
policy
abroad
i
be
the
chairman
of
this
policy
group
edward
riley
general
motor
vice
president
and
the
general
manager
of
the
overseas
operation
division
undertook
to
provide
for
me
and
the
policy
group
a
detailed
summary
of
the
best
available
think
on
the
political
and
economic
situation
in
the
postwar
overseas
world
most
of
these
finding
be
contain
in
a
letter
to
me
date
february
i
shall
quote
at
some
length
from
this
document
because
during
the
war
year
it
be
the
guideline
of
much
of
our
think
about
future
overseas
operation
i
should
like
to
submit
it
as
our
belief
write
mr
riley
that
the
united
state
will
assume
and
hold
a
strong
position
and
attitude
in
the
world
after
this
war
than
we
do
after
world
war
i
by
this
i
mean
that
regardless
of
the
course
of
our
domestic
political
development
america
with
the
past
quarter
century
of
experience
before
it
will
not
again
withdraw
into
a
position
of
isolation
from
world
problem
and
activity
which
if
permit
to
run
their
course
without
benefit
of
american
guidance
intervention
and
support
have
turn
and
can
again
turn
in
direction
wholly
oppose
to
our
interest
in
england
we
believe
certain
indication
of
future
event
can
already
be
identify
amongst
these
as
we
see
thing
today
be
the
english
determination
in
important
quarter
to
compete
as
a
world
trading
nation
on
the
basis
of
low
cost
through
efficient
production
as
oppose
to
the
prewar
position
of
cartel
protect
basic
industry
with
resultant
high
production
cost
and
consequent
need
for
protect
market
another
discernible
trend
in
england
be
the
undoubted
grow
realization
that
the
future
well
be
and
safety
of
the
british
commonwealth
can
best
be
protect
by
closer
political
collaboration
with
the
united
state
in
the
light
of
information
available
today
we
feel
that
the
dominant
center
line
of
russian
political
thought
will
continue
to
be
express
in
term
of
peaceful
development
rather
than
external
conquest
through
aggressive
warlike
action
russian
influence
have
be
direct
not
only
westward
toward
europe
but
to
the
south
and
east
as
well
persia
india
china
manchukuo
and
even
japan
have
felt
this
influence
in
the
past
russia
will
continue
her
effort
after
the
war
to
maintain
this
influence
in
all
direction
we
feel
that
the
russian
social
and
political
philosophy
will
continue
to
spread
beyond
the
border
of
russia
into
area
where
condition
favor
its
acceptance
and
development
the
most
effective
mean
of
counteract
the
spread
of
this
russian
philosophy
be
to
prevent
or
relieve
the
condition
favorable
to
its
development
and
to
demonstrate
that
the
system
of
life
which
represent
the
american
and
british
point
of
view
can
offer
as
much
or
more
to
the
mass
of
the
people
the
net
result
of
the
forego
general
viewpoint
be
that
there
will
probably
be
certain
line
of
demarcation
or
division
to
the
west
south
and
east
of
the
soviet
union
within
which
the
russian
idea
will
predominate
and
outside
of
which
the
american
and
british
viewpoint
will
prevail
base
on
past
experience
the
area
under
strong
russian
influence
after
the
war
will
probably
not
present
a
fertile
field
for
our
type
of
business
though
these
prediction
be
put
forward
only
as
tentative
educate
guess
they
prove
to
be
reasonably
good
on
the
whole
i
think
i
might
summarize
our
wartime
perspective
by
say
that
we
anticipate
something
like
the
cold
war
but
at
the
same
time
we
be
confident
that
our
overseas
operation
would
be
able
to
flourish
in
large
area
of
the
world
when
the
war
end
after
study
mr
riley
s
report
and
much
other
material
our
overseas
policy
group
under
the
chairmanship
of
albert
bradley
adopt
in
june
a
statement
deal
with
the
corporation
s
plan
for
expansion
abroad
one
large
question
confront
the
policy
group
be
whether
we
want
to
acquire
any
new
manufacturing
company
abroad
after
the
war
the
statement
take
note
of
the
world
wide
trend
toward
industrialization
and
suggest
that
this
would
be
continued
and
intensified
it
go
on
to
say
that
general
motor
expect
to
participate
in
and
support
these
trend
wherever
the
corporation
have
overseas
operating
company
however
the
statement
say
general
motor
do
not
believe
that
the
basic
condition
require
to
support
complete
manufacture
of
car
and
truck
exist
or
will
be
found
to
exist
for
some
time
in
any
country
abroad
which
do
not
already
have
such
manufacture
before
the
war
an
exception
to
the
above
be
australia
in
other
word
except
for
australia
we
anticipate
that
we
would
not
want
to
acquire
any
more
major
manufacturing
base
abroad
when
the
war
end

the
large
immediate
problem
we
face
after
the
war
concerned
the
opel
property
these
have
be
seize
by
the
german
government
soon
after
the
war
begin
in
our
entire
investment
in
opel
amount
to
about
million
and
under
a
ruling
which
the
treasury
department
have
make
concern
asset
in
enemy
hand
we
be
allow
to
write
off
the
investment
against
current
taxable
income
but
this
ruling
do
not
end
our
interest
in
or
responsibility
for
the
opel
property
as
the
end
of
the
war
drew
near
we
be
give
to
understand
that
we
be
still
consider
the
owner
of
the
opel
stock
and
we
be
also
give
to
understand
that
as
the
owner
we
might
be
oblige
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
property
at
this
point
we
be
somewhat
in
the
air
about
resume
control
of
opel
we
do
not
know
the
physical
condition
of
the
property
and
our
tax
position
be
quite
unclear
a
committee
appoint
to
study
the
question
state
the
case
as
follow
in
a
report
to
the
overseas
product
group
on
july
due
to
the
lack
of
available
information
as
to
the
condition
of
the
property
no
decision
can
be
reach
currently
as
to
the
advisability
or
inadvisability
of
dispose
of
the
stock
investment
it
would
be
incorrect
to
consider
that
the
sale
of
the
stock
for
a
nominal
amount
at
this
time
would
eliminate
any
far
tax
liability
arise
from
recovery
of
the
opel
property
the
statute
which
deal
with
war
loss
recovery
as
now
write
be
not
at
all
clear
as
to
rate
of
tax
on
recovery
limit
of
tax
date
of
recovery
and
method
of
evaluation
to
complicate
matter
still
far
the
russian
be
demand
that
the
opel
property
be
turn
over
to
them
as
reparation
and
it
appear
for
a
while
as
though
this
might
actually
be
do
but
in
the
latter
part
of
after
the
war
have
end
the
american
government
take
a
firm
position
against
such
a
move
i
should
mention
perhaps
that
general
motor
played
no
role
at
all
in
any
of
the
discussion
concern
the
possibility
of
use
the
opel
property
as
reparation
indeed
i
felt
at
one
point
that
we
could
not
possibly
regard
opel
as
a
money
make
operation
in
a
letter
to
mr
riley
date
march
i
write
my
personal
conviction
be
it
right
or
wrong
be
that
under
exist
circumstance
so
far
as
we
can
see
there
be
no
justification
whatsoever
of
general
motor
take
any
operating
responsibility
commensurate
to
what
it
be
carry
before
the
war
from
the
standpoint
of
make
a
profit
it
do
not
appear
to
me
that
a
limited
market
such
as
indicate
in
your
assumption
justif
y
all
that
we
would
have
to
go
through
my
pessimistic
conclusion
i
be
afraid
reflect
a
good
deal
of
the
emotional
impact
of
the
war
and
its
devastation
and
of
course
the
large
number
of
unknown
in

evolve
out

between

minute
of

report
date

receive
from
the
special
committee
appoint
by
the
president
to
examine
the
desirability
of
resume
operation
in
western
germany
it
be
the
conclusion
of
the
financial
policy
committee
that
in
view
of
the
many
uncertainty
surround
the
operation
of
this
property
the
corporation
be
not
justified
in
resume
the
responsibility
for
its
operation
at
this
time
the
overseas
policy
group
held
a
meeting
on
april
and
discuss
the
conclusion
reach
at
the
april
meeting
of
the
financial
policy
committee
after
far
consideration
of
the
report
submit
by
the
special
study
committee
the
opinion
be
express
that
the
generally
unfavorable
attitude
of
the
financial
policy
committee
toward
resumption
of
operating
control
of
adam
opel
a
g
arose
largely
from
uncertainty
in
the
mind
of
the
various
member
of
the
committee
with
respect
to
certain
important
aspect
of
the
situation
the
group
thought
that
these
uncertainty
might
be
boil
down
to
a
few
basic
question
in
the
discussion
i
urge
that
if
a
majority
of
the
point
of
uncertainty
be
clearly
set
forth
and
clarify
in
a
brief
memorandum
they
might
provide
a
basis
for
reopen
the
question
of
resume
control
with
the
financial
policy
committee
i
suggest
that
mr
riley
undertake
the
preparation
of
basic
material
for
such
a
memorandum
and
state
that
if
upon
completion
it
be
agree
that
the
point
thus
dealt
with
possess
sufficient
substance
and
effectiveness
i
would
be
willing
to
submit
a
far
report
and
to
request
the
financial
policy
committee
to
reconsider
the
entire
matter
mr
wilson
in
a
letter
to
me
date
april
have
point
out
that
the
opel
situation
have
be
much
in
his
mind
since
the
financial
policy
committee
action
excerpt
from
this
letter
be
as
follow
i
be
surprised
monday
to
find
myself
the
only
member
of
the
financial
policy
committee
who
be
willing
to
resume
operation
in
germany
with
the
exception
of
mr
donner
who
concur
in
and
support
the
unanimous
recommendation
of
the
special
committee
of
which
he
be
a
member
it
be
obvious
to
me
however
that
the
matter
cannot
long
be
left
in
its
present
status
and
that
it
will
again
have
to
be
consider
by
the
fpc
i
do
not
believe
that
such
a
review
should
be
undertaken
until
after
the
election
in
italy
and
until
walter
carpenter
and
albert
bradley
can
join
in
the
discussion
and
share
in
the
responsibility
for
the
final
decision
in
reply
to
mr
wilson
s
letter
to
me
i
write
him
under
date
of
april
in
part
as
follow
you
state
you
be
surprised
monday
to
find
yourself
the
only
member
of
the
committee
who
be
willing
to
resume
operation
in
germany
with
the
exception
of
mr
donner
and
perhaps
mr
bradley
that
be
not
correct
so
far
as
i
be
concerned
i
have
be
willing
right
along
to
resume
operation
in
germany
and
still
be
willing
to
do
so
provide
i
have
a
definite
bill
of
particular
which
i
can
consistently
support
i
come
into
the
meeting
of
the
fpc
with
the
hope
that
we
could
lay
down
certain
definite
principle
along
the
line
of
your
assumption
i
urge
that
this
be
consider
in
their
absence
i
be
force
against
my
fundamental
conviction
to
take
the
negative
position
i
agree
with
you
that
the
matter
be
in
very
unsatisfactory
condition
at
the
moment
i
felt
so
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
on
monday
and
even
more
so
after
the
subsequent
discussion
on
tuesday
it
be
for
that
reason
that
i
urge
on
tuesday
the
same
as
i
try
to
have
consider
on
monday
a
concrete
proposal
set
forth
the
condition
under
which
we
would
resume
i
be
quite
of
the
belief
that
if
that
can
be
do
it
be
not
impossible
that
the
fpc
may
reverse
itself
anyway
the
effort
be
with
them
there
follow
a
series
of
discussion
between
mr
riley
and
myself
to
clarify
some
of
the
uncertainty
and
establish
realistic
limitation
that
would
be
acceptable
to
the
overseas
operation
division
from
the
operating
point
of
view
as
a
result
of
this
exchange
of
view
i
draft
a
report
and
submit
it
to
the
financial
policy
committee
under
date
of
april
in
which
i
stress
the
follow
point
it
must
be
recognize
that
this
be
not
the
same
question
that
come
before
the
then
finance
committee
in
it
be
not
a
question
of
whether
we
will
enter
germany
in
an
operating
way
we
be
already
there
the
original
question
involve
in
general
a
very
important
principle
of
major
policy
which
i
will
expose
later
put
more
specifically
the
problem
in
involve
the
export
of
a
very
considerable
amount
of
capital
the
uncertainty
of
our
ability
to
organize
a
complete
and
highly
technical
manufacturing
operation
in
a
foreign
country
the
potentiality
of
the
market
for
a
somewhat
different
although
related
line
of
product
the
profit
possibility
and
other
consideration
the
present
question
must
contemplate
no
export
of
capital
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
report
reflect
a
situation
exist
close
to
economic
stagnation
so
far
as
a
foundation
for
constructive
enterprise
be
concerned
but
how
could
it
be
otherwise
the
whole
german
economy
since
the
close
of
the
war
have
be
in
status
quo
so
far
as
a
constructive
and
aggressive
attack
to
rebuild
it
be
concerned
the
question
of
whether
general
motor
be
to
remain
a
national
enterprise
manufacturing
in
this
country
and
export
its
product
outside
wherever
market
exist
or
whether
it
be
destine
to
continue
to
expand
as
an
international
organization
manufacturing
where
constructive
opportunity
present
themselves
in
support
of
or
independent
of
its
american
production
be
determine
in
the
latter
part
of
the
twenty
i
be
convince
that
gm
must
whether
it
like
it
or
not
aggressively
follow
that
policy
i
believe
the
sole
consideration
involve
any
particular
question
be
as
to
whether
the
opportunity
for
profit
justifies
the
venture
from
the
long
term
position
of
the
business
specifically
i
make
these
recommendation
that
the
committee
reconsider
the
decision
reach
at
its
meeting
on
april
th
and
bring
the
report
before
it
for
far
consideration
that
the
committee
authorize
the
resumption
of
the
management
of
adam
opel
a
g
for
a
probationary
period
of
approximately
two
year
and
after
the
two
year
probationary
period
the
situation
be
review
in
light
of
the
then
exist
circumstance
that
the
condition
under
which
we
resume
the
managerial
responsibility
shall
be
as
hereafter
define
it
be
not
intend
that
the
condition
so
define
will
be
underwritten
by
any
authority
or
that
any
authority
will
take
any
responsibility
relative
to
same
it
be
intend
that
they
shall
be

pre
determine
basis
of
withdraw
from
the
management
responsibility
any
time
during
the
two
year
period
if
in
the
opinion
of
our
administration
of
the
business
the
operating
condition
have
become
such
that
it
be
useless
or
impossible
to
continue
far
my
fourth
point
spell
out
the
condition
refer
to
in
the
previous
point
general
motor
should
risk
no
additional
capital

complete
freedom
in
personnel
policy
and
administration
the
product
produce
by
adam
opel
a
g

solely
within
the
jurisdiction

if
price
have
to
be
approve
by

a
reasonable
return
on
the
capital

of
any

by

of
which
mr

have
conclude
in
june
that
australia
be
probably
the
only
country
in
which
we
would
want
to
consider
establish
a
new
major
manufacturing
base
after
the
war
by
september
the
overseas
policy
group
have
far
decide
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
move
in
the
direction
of
complete
car
manufacture
in
australia
this
prove
to
be
a
timely
decision
for
in
october
of
that
year
the
australian
government
officially
invite
general
motor
as
well
as
other
interested
party
to
submit
proposal
for
the
manufacture
of
a
motorcar
in

as
our
think
in
this
area
have
already
largely
crystallize
we
be
able
to
move
quickly
in
accept
this
invitation
in
a
report
to
the
administration
committee
date
november
which
have
the
approval
of
the
overseas
policy
group
the
case
for
manufacturing
in
australia
be
state
it
be
point
out
that
we
be
already
manufacturing
there
to
some
extent
and
a
decision
to
go
all
the
way
be
only
a
question
of
degree
australia
have
the
skilled

and
other
economic
foundation
for
an
automobile

as
well

doubtless
be

there

exception
be

even
mr

for
all
his

clearly
outside

by
our

no

here
to

detailed
individual
history
of
our

outside
of

the
story
of
our
pioneer
in
the
diesel
business
of
our
development
of
the
frigidaire
line
of
product
and
of
our
aviation
business
be
the
subject
of
this
chapter
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
trace
a
coherent
pattern
in
general
motor
venture
outside
the
automobile
business
but
chance
and
other
factor
that
enter
the
picture
make
it
difficult
to
do
so
we
have
of
course
some
natural
interest
in
diversification
which
might
afford
us
a
hedge
against
any
decline
in
automobile
sale
but
we
never
have
a
master
plan
for
nonautomotive
venture
we
get
into
them
for
different
reason
and
we
be
very
lucky
at
some
crucial
point
we
get
into
the
diesel
field
for
example
because
of
mr
kettering
s
special
interest
in
diesel
engine
date
back
as
early
as
when
he
be
experiment
with
diesel
power
in
an
attempt
to
find
a
suitable
engine
for
the
generator
in
a
farm
light
set
he
want
to
manufacture
mr
durant
put
general
motor
in
the
refrigerator
business
for
reason
of
his
own
but
it
be
clear
as
i
shall
show
that
we
would
have
abandon
frigidaire
in
its
early
year
have
it
not
be
for
an
odd
combination
of
event
and
we
get
into
aviation
because
we
thought
the
small
airplane
would
be
an
important
competitor
of
the
automobile
it
be
worthy
of
note
i
believe
that
these
be
relatively
new
product
at
the
time
we
first
invest
in
them
there
be
no
diesel
locomotive
capable
of
provide
mainline
service
on
american
railroad
the
electric
refrigerator
be
only
an
impractical
gadget
and
the
future
of
aviation
be
anybody
s
guess
in
other
word
we
do
not
simply
use
our
financial
and
engineering
resource
to
take
over
new
product
outside
the
automobile
business
we
get
in
early
as
long
as
forty
five
year
ago
and
help
develop
them
our
operation
in
these
field
have
be
expand
but
we
have
go
into
nothing
entirely
new
in
more
recent
year
except
for
the
purchase
in
of

diesel
electric
locomotive
general
motor
enter
the
locomotive
industry
in
a
small
way
in
the
early
s
at
the
time
railroad
in
the
united
state
seem
to
have
very
little
interest
in
diesel
locomotive
except
for
special
switch
engine
use
yet
in
less
than
a
decade
the
diesel
be
outsell
the
steam
locomotive
and
general
motor
be
outsell
all
other
locomotive
manufacturer
combine
because
we
lead
the
diesel
revolution
with
tremendous
saving
to
the
railroad
industry
the
electro
motive
division
today
enjoys
a
large
part
of
the
locomotive
market
there
be
i
think
two
principal
reason
for
this
rather
spectacular
progress
the
first
be
simply
that
we
be
more
tenacious
in
our
effort
to
produce
lightweight
high
speed
diesel
engine
suitable
for
over
the
road
use
on
american
railroad
the
second
reason
be
that
we
brought
to
the
locomotive
industry
some
of
the
manufacturing
engineering
and
marketing
concept
of
the
automobile
industry
until
we
begin
make
diesel
locomotive
have
always
be
produce
on
a
custom
basis
with
the
railroad
specify
their
requirement
to
the
manufacturer
in
considerable
detail
so
that
virtually
no
two
locomotive
on
american
railroad
be
alike
but
almost
from
the
begin
we
offer
the
railroad
a
standard
locomotive
one
that
we
be
able
to
produce
in
volume
at
a
relatively
low
price
in
addition
we
guaranteed
performance
at
a
low
net
cost
per
ton
mile
than
be
possible
with
the
use
of
steam
engine
and
we
make
good
our
guarantee
by
maintain
a
service
organization
and
provide
standardize
replacement
part
this
program
revolutionize
the
locomotive
industry
and
secure
our
own
place
in
it
there
be
of
course
nothing
new
about
the
principle
of
the
diesel
engine
at
the
time
that
general
motor
first
become
interested
in
it
rudolph
diesel
a
german
inventor
receive
the
original
patent
for
this
kind
of
engine
in
and
built
a
successful
unit
with
one
cylinder
and
twenty
five
horsepower
in
as
early
as
a
sixty
horsepower
two
cylinder
diesel
unit
be
built
in
this
country
these
early
device
embody
essentially
the
same
compression
ignition
principle
as
the
engine
in
a
modern
diesel
locomotive
the
four
cycle

engine
work
this
way
on
the
first
suction
stroke
of
the
piston
the
engine
draw
in
air
and
nothing
else
the
next
stroke
of
the
piston
compress
the
air
to
something
like
pound
per
square
inch
create
a
temperature
of
around
fahrenheit
just
before
the
end
of
the
compression
stroke
oil
be
inject
as
a
fine
spray
into
the
combustion
chamber
under
high
pressure
the
hot
air
ignites
this
fuel
the
third
and
fourth
stroke
of
the
piston
provide
the
power
and
exhaust
as
in
a
gasoline
engine
however
the
diesel
require
neither
a
carburetor
nor
an
electric
ignition
and
thus
have
an
edge
in
simplicity
over
the
gasoline
engine
as
this
description
indicates
the
diesel
convert
its
fuel
directly
into
a
source
of
energy
in
this
respect
it
be
unlike
the
steam
engine
whose
fuel
be
use
only
to
create
steam
and
unlike
the
gasoline
engine
which
vaporizes
its
fuel
before
it
can
be
ignite
both
of
these
engine
be
less
efficient
than
the
diesel
which
have
in
fact
the
high
thermal
efficiency
of
any
heat
engine
in
everyday
use
the
modern
diesel
us
a
distil
petroleum
fuel

but
other
fuel
have
be

in
the
past
rudolph
diesel
himself
have
intend
to
run
his
engine
on
powder
coal
but
his
engineer
associate
persuade
him
at
the
outset
to
use
petroleum
oil
in
order
to
avoid
the
problem
of
score
powder
coal
be
use
later
experimentally
by
others
attempt
to
follow
diesel
s
original
intention
and
other
fuel
have
be
try
but
petroleum
oil
remains
the
standard
diesel
fuel
despite
its
great
efficiency
the
diesel
engine
be
for
many
year
quite
limited
in
practical
use
with
few
exception
the
engine
be
large
heavy
and
slow
run
and
so
found
their
great
application
in
power
station
pump
and
marine
use
they
weigh
or
pound
per
horsepower
and
this
indeed
be
the
heart
of
the
problem
to
build
a
powerful
fast
run
diesel
of
relatively
small
size
i
have
say
there
be
nothing
new
about
the
principle
of
the
diesel
engine
i
might
add
that
there
be
no
unknown
principle
concern
any
component
part
of
the
diesel
power
locomotive
that
general
motor
create
what
be
lack
be
the
imagination
the
initiative
and
the
talent
to
work
out
the
problem
to
the
point
of
practicability
european
have
be
work
on
this
development
since
the
second
decade
of
this
century
and
have
some
diesel
railcar
and
locomotive
in
operation
by
by
a
few
u
s
diesel
manufacturer
have
successfully
built
a
number
of
diesel
engine
for
switcher
service
since
weight
be
an
advantage
in
switcher
and
since
they
show
economy
over
steam
in
operation
they
met
with
some
success
however
attempt
to
build
diesel
engine
for
mainline
passenger
and
freight
application
in
this
country
be
not
successful
since
in
these
case
weight
power
and
size
be
critical
bring
the
diesel
engine
down
to
more
manageable
proportion
with
a
low
weight
per
horsepower
ratio
be
the
principal
concern
of
our
engineer
in
a
large
organization
like
general
motor
it
be
seldom
possible
to
assign
to
any
one
person
the
credit
or
blame
for
initiate
some
major
undertaking
but
in
the
case
of
the
diesel
charles
f
kettering
come
very
close
to
be
the
whole
story
the
general
motor
research
corporation
forerunner
of
our
present
research
laboratory
be
test
diesel
engine
under
mr
kettering
s
close
scrutiny
as
early
as
after
mr
kettering
bought
himself
a
diesel
power
yacht
in
april
these
engine
become
a
major
preoccupation
of
his
as
anyone
who
knew
him
might
have
guess
when
on
his
yacht
he
be
more
often
tinker
in
the
engine
room
than
relax
on
deck
he
be
already
convince
that
the
diesel
do
not
have
to
be
unreasonably
large
and
heavy
i
become
interested
in
the
possible
development
of
the
diesel
engine
for
general
motor
at
about
the
same
time
if
my
memory
serf
me
correctly
i
remember
drop
in
one
day
at
the
research
laboratory
in
detroit
and
say
to
mr
kettering
ket
why
be
it
recognize
the
high
efficiency
of
the
diesel
cycle
that
it
have
never
be
more
generally
use
in
his
characteristic
way
he
say
the
reason
be
that
the
engine
would
not
run
in
the
way
that
the
engineer
want
it
to
run
i
then
say
to
him
very
well
we
be
now
in
the
diesel
engine
business
you
tell
us
how
the
engine
should
run
and
i
will
see
that
available
manufacturing
facility
be
provide
to
capitalize
the
program
of
course
say
that
we
be
in
the
diesel
business
be
a
manner
of
speak
i
meant
i
would
support
him
in
the
organization
in
mr
kettering
and
an
engineering
group
at
the
research
laboratory
begin
a
series
of
comprehensive
test
on
the
diesel
engine
then
be
offer
by
various
manufacturer
an
analysis
of
these
test
combine
with
a
thorough
study
of
current
scientific
literature
on
diesel
finally
lead
mr
kettering
to
conclude
that
the
solution
to
his
problem
be
the
so
call
two
cycle
diesel
engine
the
two
cycle
engine
be
nothing
new
at
that
time
indeed
the
truly
remarkable
feature
of
mr
kettering
s
conclusion
be
his
conviction
that
the
two
cycle
principle
be
ideally
suit
to
the
small
diesel
engine
though
it
have
be
thoroughly
explore
before
it
generally
have
be
reject
as
unworkable
except
in
large
slow
speed
engine
in
the
two
cycle
engine
the
intake
of
fresh
air
and
the
exhaust
of
burn
gas
take
place
at
the
same
time
one
stroke
out
of
every
two
be
a
power
stroke
instead
of
one
out
of
four
as
in
the
four
cycle
engine
the
result
be
an
engine
that
have
less
than
one
fifth
the
weight
and
one
sixth
the
size
of
its
predecessor
four
cycle
engine
of
equivalent
power
output
but
this
small
device
create
some
awesome
engineering
problem
for
one
thing
the
two
cycle
engine
as
developed
by
mr
kettering
call
for
much
great
precision
in
the
fuel
injection
system
specifically
what
the
research
laboratory
be
call
upon
to
produce
and
finally
do
produce
be
a
unit
fuel
injector
whose
part
fit
with
a
clearance
of
to
millionth
of
an
inch
and
an
injector
pump
which
built
up
pressure
as
high
as
pound
per
square
inch
as
it
force
fuel
through
hole
to
thousandth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
drill
in
the
injector
tip
the
two
cycle
engine
also
have
to
have
an
external
air
pump
this
become
another
major
project
but
finally
research
deliver
what
be
need
a
light
compact
device
able
to
pump
large
quantity
of
air
at
a
pressure
of
about
three
to
six
pound
by
the
end
of
it
be
clear
that
the
two
cycle
engine
be
practical
and
that
mr
kettering
have
achieve
a
major
breakthrough
in
diesel
technology
it
be
also
clear
that
the
time
have
come
to
provide
the
manufacturing
facility
i
have
promise
him
we
look
around
for
the
special
facility
that
be
need
our
buildup
consist
principally
of
the
purchase
of
two
company
the
winton
engine
company
and
the
electro
motive
engineering
company
both
of
cleveland
ohio
winton
be
a
manufacturer
of
diesel
engine
primarily
for
marine
us
it
have
built
mr
kettering
s
second
set
of
yacht
engine
and
also
of
certain
kind
of
large
gasoline
engine
electro
motive
be
an
engineering
design
and
sale
firm
with
no
manufacturing
facility
of
its
own
the
two
firm
have
have
an
intimate
business
relationship
for
almost
a
decade
during
that
time
electro
motive
and
winton
have
built
a
substantial
business
and
reputation
in
the
design
and
sale
of
gas
electric
railcar
primarily
for
use
on
short
haul
run
building
the
engine
for
these
railcar
be
a
major
part
of
winton
s
business
during
most
of
the
s
relative
to
steam
however
the
operating
economy
of
gas
car
kept
diminish
and
toward
the
end
of
the
decade
electro
motive
begin
to
find
itself
in
trouble
try
to
continue
to
sell
the
gas
electric
car
which
in
turn
have
its
effect
on
winton
against
this
background
winton
and
electro
motive
begin
around
and
to
look
seriously
into
the
possibility
of
use
diesel
power
on
the
railroad
harold
hamilton
then
president
of
electro
motive
encounter
the
same
problem
of
fuel
injection
that
mr
kettering
be
then
wrestling
with
mr
hamilton
be
also
try
to
develop
a
small
diesel
engine
with
the
technology
then
available
to
him
the
small
diesel
he
could
build
be
one
weigh
about
sixty
pound
per
horsepower
a
locomotive
he
felt
require
an
engine
weigh
no
more
than
twenty
pound
per
horsepower
with
a
crankshaft
speed
of
about
revolution
per
minute
though
there
be
a
few
available
diesel
engine
which
closely
match
these
specification
mr
hamilton
do
not
feel
that
they
could
stand
up
to
the
performance
and
reliability
requirement
which
he
felt
be
necessary
for
successful
railroad
application
furthermore
mr
hamilton
realize
that
the
diesel
he
want
would
require
metal
tube
and
joint
able
to
last
for
long
period
of
time
even
when
they
have
to
carry
fuel
under
pressure
of
and
pound
to
the
square
inch
winton
be
not
able
to
develop
this
kind
of
metallurgy
and
mr
hamilton
knew
of
no
place
in
the
industry
where
it
be
available
he
finally
conclude
that
it
would
take
about
million
of
venture
capital
to
solve
his
and
winton
s
problem
perhaps
million
to
overcome
the
technological
obstacle
and
another
million
or
thereabouts
to
provide
the
plant
and
equipment
need
for
manufacturing
facility
it
be
speedily
make
apparent
to
mr
hamilton
and
also
to
george
w
codrington
the
president
of
winton
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
raise
the
money
at
the
bank
and
that
there
be
certainly
no
such
venture
capital
anywhere
in
the
railroad
industry
neither
the
carrier
nor
the
locomotive
manufacturer
show
enough
interest
in
the
diesel
to
undertake
the
research
necessary
at
about
this
time
however
mr
kettering
become
acquaint
with
mr
codrington
as
the
result
of
order
winton
engine
for
his
second
yacht
he
bought
these
engine
simply
because
codrington
agree
though
reluctantly
to
put
in
a
new
kind
of
injector
that
one
of
the
winton
engineer
be
develop
at
the
time
and
which
mr
kettering
felt
held
great
promise
i
don
t
know
who
first
suggest
the
idea
of
winton
s
come
into
general
motor
in
any
event
we
begin
to
negotiate
formally
in
the
late
summer
of
agreement
on
the
purchase
of
winton
have
almost
be
reach
in
october
when
the
great
market
crash
temporarily
confuse
the
picture
but
there
be
never
any
serious
question
in
our
mind
that
winton
be
a
good
buy
for
us
for
one
thing
we
be
not
at
this
point
certain
about
the
future
of
the
u
s
automobile
market
which
have
not
be
expand
during
the
late
s
consequently
we
have
a
natural
interest
in
any
enterprise
within
our
scope
that
offer
us
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
diversify
the
case
for
buying
winton
be
state
by
john
l
pratt
vice
president
in
a
memorandum
which
he
address
to
the
operation
and
finance
committee
date
october
as
follow
we
have
have
under
consideration
for
some
time
past
the
possible
purchase
of
the
winton
engine
company
locate
at
cleveland
ohio
which
subject
have
be
informally
discuss
at
previous
meeting
it
be
believe
that
the
diesel
engine
development
in
this
country
have
arrive
at
a
point
where
it
have
become
commercial
and
be
probably
on
the
eve
of
considerable
expansion
the
winton
engine
company
be
unquestionably
the
outstanding
diesel
engine
manufacturer
in
the
united
state
the
winton
company
have
a
capable
management
and
would
not
require
any
additional
personnel
immediately
if
the
business
continue
to
expand
as
we
believe
it
will
we
may
think
it
desirable
to
add
to
its
personnel
another
good
executive
perhaps
as
assistant
general
manager
or
sale
manager
the
purchase
of
this
company
will
give
us
a
vehicle
for
capitalize
the
development
of
our
research
organization
along
engine
line
and
will
assist
materially
in
keep
us
abreast
of
diesel
engine
development
the
business
should
also
be
reasonably
profitable
and
if
expansion
continue
as
most
of
our
engineer
believe
it
will
we
should
ultimately
make
a
good
return
on
the
investment
require
to
purchase
the
winton
company
finally
in
june
the
winton
operation
become
a
part
of
general
motor
with
mr
codrington
continue
as
president
win
ton
s
principal
market
continued
to
be
in
large
marine
engine
five
month
after
the
winton
acquisition
we
also
acquire
electro
motive
and
again
the
old
management
of
the
company
continued
to
run
its
affair
during
the
negotiation
to
acquire
electro
motive
mr
hamilton
and
mr
kettering
continued
to
hold
many
lengthy
discussion
about
the
challenge
of
the
lightweight
diesel
engine
in
his
testimony
before
a
senate
subcommittee
mr
hamilton
described
the
tremendous
enthusiasm
of
mr
kettering
for
the
job
of
develop
a
diesel
engine
it
be
just
like
ring
a
bell
to
a
fire
horse
he
recall
mr
hamilton
in
fact
make
it
clear
that
he
be
not
attract
to
general
motor
merely
by
the
corporation
s
great
economic
strength
we
have
more
than
that
in
general
motor
he
comment
of
the
company
that
i
knew
at
that
time
many
of
them
with
plenty
of
financial
resource
none
of
them
have
the
mental
approach
to
this
problem
that
be
necessary
to
take
it
at
that
stage
that
it
be
in
then
and
the
courage
that
go
along
with
it
to
move
it
to
its
point
of
success
at
least
that
be
our
opinion
in
the
matter
in
winton
s
name
be
change
to
cleveland
diesel
engine
division
and
in
its
operation
be
consolidated
with
those
of
the
electro
motive
division
in
too
we
set
up
the
detroit
diesel
engine
division
to
produce
small
diesel
engine
for
marine
and
industrial
use
though
there
have
be
some
overlap
in
their
product
over
the
year
it
have
be
generally
true
that
the
detroit
diesel
engine
division
have
specialized
in
small
engine
for
a
while
winton
and
electro
motive
operate
about
as
before
mr
hamilton
and
mr
kettering
both
have
the
impression
that
it
would
take
a
considerable
length
of
time
to
build
a
commercially
acceptable
diesel
engine
for
the
railroad
meanwhile
mr
kettering
devote
his
effort
in
large
measure
to
perfect
the
two
cycle
diesel
engine
by
mr
kettering
decide
he
could
build
a
two
cycle
eight
cylinder
engine
that
would
produce
about
horsepower
since
mr
kettering
s
new
engine
would
have
a
good
edge
over
exist
four
cycle
engine
in
the
horsepower
range
particularly
in
the
weight
per
horsepower
ratio
his
engine
seem
worth
building
at
about
this
time
we
be
planning
our
exhibit
for
the
century
of
progress
world
s
fair
which
be
schedule
to
open
in
chicago
in
our
exhibit
be
to
be
a
dramatic
display
an
automobile
assembly
line
in
actual
operation
produce
chevrolet
passenger
car
we
need
a
source
of
power
for
the
assembly
line
and
decide
that
two
of
mr
kettering
s
propose
horsepower
diesel
engine
would
do
the
job
when
we
first
conceive
the
idea
of
power
our
world
s
fair
display
with
the
new
diesel
engine
what
we
have
in
mind
be
to
get
a
good
long
look
at
the
engine
under
actual
operating
condition
we
be
primarily
concerned
with
prove
that
mr
kettering
s
basic
design
be
a
good
and
practical
one
we
do
not
anticipate
that
the
commercial
application
would
come
as
soon
as
they
do
but
before
the
engine
for
the
display
be
even
finish
our
perspective
on
this
matter
be
drastically
alter
what
change
it
principally
be
the
sudden
interest
of
one
railroad
president
ralph
budd
of
the
burlington
in
the
diesel
engine
mr
budd
be
then
hop
to
build
a
new
streamline
lightweight
passenger
train
that
would
be
dramatic
in
appearance
and
economical
in
operation
one
day
in
the
fall
of
he
stop
off
in
cleveland
to
see
mr
hamilton
who
told
him
about
general
motor
diesel
experiment
and
put
him
in
touch
with
mr
kettering
mr
budd
be
excite
about
the
prospect
he
paid
a
visit
to
detroit
and
to
the
general
motor
research
laboratory
mr
kettering
show
him
the
experimental
two
cycle
engine
but
warn
him
that
the
eight
cylinder
model
be
not
yet
built
and
certainly
require
a
great
deal
more
development
work
before
it
could
be
consider
seriously
as
a
source
of
locomotive
power
mr
budd
be
told
about
general
motor
plan
to
test
the
engine
at
the
world
s
fair
when
the
fair
finally
open
our
diesel
engine
be
visible
through
a
plate
glass
window
to
anyone
who
care
to
inspect
them
however
we
be
still
apprehensive
about
them
and
the
publicity
man
for
our
exhibit
be
under
strict
order
to
say
nothing
about
them
even
though
they
be
in
a
sense
the
most
dramatic
feature
of
our
exhibit
the
engine
be
unheralded
then
but
mr
budd
at
least
paid
close
attention
to
them
during
the
entire
fair
he
be
well
aware
of
the
difficulty
we
be
have
with
the
engine
he
knew
that
every
night
one
or
two
engineer
have
to
work
on
them
to
ensure
that
they
would
still
be
function
the
next
day
he
knew
the
opinion
of
mr
kettering
s
son
eugene
who
be
in
charge
of
the
maintenance
operation
and
who
later
comment
that
the
only
part
of
that
engine
that
work
well
be
the
dipstick
nevertheless
mr
budd
continued
to
press
us
for
a
diesel
engine
that
he
could
use
on
his
burlington
zephyr
he
become
more
insistent
than
ever
when
in
the
union
pacific
publicly
announce
its
plan
to
build
a
streamline
train
the
union
pacific
be
planning
only
a
small
three
car
affair
without
any
real
locomotive
the
power
car
be
to
be
an
integral
part
of
the
train
itself
the
power
be
derive
from
a
twelve
cylinder
horsepower
gasoline
engine
which
be
built
by
winton
there
be
no
major
technological
innovation
in
this
union
pacific
train
but
picture
of
it
be
widely
distribute
the
public
reception
be
quite
favorable
and
suddenly
the
nation
be
very
much
interested
in
streamliner
all
of
this
serve
to
fortify
mr
budd
s
desire
which
be
intense
anyway
to
put
his
own
streamliner
in
business
but
he
still
want
diesel
power
we
would
have
prefer
to
spend
another
year
or
two
take
the
bug
out
of
mr
kettering
s
engine
but
mr
budd
s
insistence
finally
won
us
over
in
june
we
agree
to
build
an
eight
cylinder
horsepower
diesel
engine
for
his
pioneer
zephyr
when
it
be
put
in
test
operation
in
april
it
broke
down
continually
as
we
have
fear
however
the
defect
be
gradually
iron
out
of
it
and
in
june
mr
budd
order
two
more
a
general
motor
diesel
as
they
be
call
for
his
twin
zephyr
meanwhile
the
union
pacific
have
not
wait
for
the
delivery
of
its
streamliner
before
this
it
have
place
a
new
order
with
winton
in
late
june
this
time
for
a
twelve
cylinder
horsepower
diesel
for
a
six
car
articulate
sleep
car
train
and
again
in
february
the
union
pacific
order
six
horsepower
diesel
passenger
unit
for
its
city
series
these
early
diesel
power
streamliner
be
spectacular
success
in
a
memorable
test
run
from
denver
to
chicago
the
burlington
zephyr
average
mile
per
hour
for
a
total
run
time
of
only
thirteen
hour
and
ten
minute
the
union
pacific
city
train
cut
the
run
time
from
the
west
coast
to
chicago
from
over
sixty
to
less
than
forty
hour
operating
cost
to
the
railroad
be
low
and
passenger
patronage
be
considerably
high
both
of
our
customer
immediately
begin
call
upon
us
for
more
power
so
they
could
lengthen
their
train
in
may
we
begin
deliver
the
union
pacific
s
horsepower
diesel
we
furnish
the
burlington
with
two
engine
of
horsepower
apiece
these
engine
be
able
to
pull
twelve
car
train
one
day
early
in
mr
kettering
and
mr
hamilton
paid
me
a
visit
and
we
get
to
talk
about
the
diesel
mr
hamilton
who
be
always
in
close
touch
with
the
railroad
people
told
me
that
our
engine
be
consider
by
them
to
be
a
vast
success
however
he
say
the
railroad
be
begin
to
ask
general
motor
to
supply
them
with
all
purpose
diesel
power
locomotive
instead
of
merely
engine
for
power
car
mr
kettering
indicate
that
he
would
like
to
undertake
the
development
of
an
experimental
diesel
power
locomotive
i
inquire
how
much
money
he
thought
he
would
need
mr
kettering
say
that
he
thought
it
might
take
as
much
as
i
told
him
that
my
own
experience
with
new
development
project
suggest
strongly
that
he
could
not
give
us
a
new
locomotive
on
such
a
comparatively
modest
sum
i
know
he
reply
amiably
but
i
figure
if
we
spend
that
much
you
ll
come
through
with
the
rest
he
get
the
money
actually
we
be
a
long
way
from
be
in
the
locomotive
business
at
that
time
our
only
production
facility
be
those
for
make
engine
in
the
winton
plant
and
even
these
be
somewhat
outmode
we
have
nothing
at
all
for
building
electrical
transmission
equipment
and
locomotive
body
accordingly
we
decide
early
in
to
build
our
own
factory
at
la
grange
illinois
this
plant
originally
produce
only
the
body
of
the
locomotive
the
cab
and
the
truck
with
the
engine
come
from
winton
and
the
other
component
from
outside
supplier
as
before
but
the
la
grange
plant
be
design
so
that
we
could
expand
its
operation
to
produce
and
assemble
all
the
part
of
a
locomotive
we
begin
this
expansion
soon
after
the
plant
be
complete
by
la
grange
be
a
fully
integrate
locomotive
plant
our
early
experience
with
the
diesel
be
as
i
have
indicate
in
the
passenger
locomotive
field
but
in
the
mid
thirty
mr
hamilton
and
his
group
decide
that
there
be
a
great
economic
potential
for
diesel
power
switch
locomotive
at
that
time
one
of
our
competitor
be
offering
the
railroad
a
diesel
power
switcher
that
weigh
about
one
hundred
ton
and
sell
as
high
as
the
locomotive
be
in
large
measure
built
to
the
customer
s
specification
it
be
mr
hamilton
s
contention
that
if
the
customer
be
willing
to
accept
a
standard
diesel
switcher
right
off
the
shelf
then
we
could
market
one
for
under
his
prod
we
begin
to
build
these
switcher
indeed
we
put
fifty
of
them
in
production
before
we
have
one
firm
order
the
importance
we
attach
to
this
new
policy
may
be
gauge
by
a
memorandum
write
on
december
it
be
from
mr
pratt
to
me
and
it
say
at
one
point
there
be
one
fundamental
policy
which
we
believe
will
have
to
be
maintain
namely
that
the
electro
motive
corporation
will
build
a
standardize
product
and
not
undertake
to
build
to
the
many
different
standard
and
specification
on
which
each
railroad
demand
to
purchase
and
our
recommendation
be
that
the
policy
of
building
a
standard
product
be
give
at
least
a
fair
trial
before
we
yield
to
obtain
business
by
let
each
railroad
write
its
own
specification
as
to
what
the
locomotive
should
be
as
it
turn
out
the
issue
be
settle
very
quickly
our
first
batch
of
switcher
be
sell
easily
delivery
begin
in
may
although
the
margin
of
profit
be
small
at
first
it
be
enough
to
make
a
big
difference
in
electro
motive
s
profit
picture
mr
hamilton
promise
the
railroad
that
as
our
volume
in
switcher
increase
we
would
pas
along
our
operating
economy
to
them
in
the
form
of
price
reduction
by
when
the
war
production
board
take
general
motor
out
of
the
switcher
field
and
direct
us
to
concentrate
entirely
on
freight
locomotive
we
have
built
switcher
and
the
price
to
our
customer
on
the
horsepower
switcher
be
down
to
by
october
meanwhile
our
passenger
locomotive
business
expand
rapidly
by
we
have
about
diesel
power
passenger
locomotive
in
service
on
railroad
all
over
the
country
we
begin
to
build
freight
locomotive
in
there
be
an
interruption
during
the
early
part
of
world
war
ii
when
our
plant
be
virtually
out
of
the
locomotive
business
while
produce
lst
engine
for
the
navy
at
this
point
the
reader
may
be
wonder
what
the
rest
of
the
locomotive
industry
be
do
while
we
be
push
ahead
with
our
diesel
program
with
only
a
few
exception
and
qualification
the
answer
be
that
the
rest
of
the
industry
be
stick
with
steam
power
though
a
few
attempt
be
make
in
this
country
and
canada
to
build
diesel
passenger
locomotive
before
production
never
advanced
beyond
the
prototype
in
a
diesel
power
passenger
locomotive
built
by
a
competitor
finally
go
into
service
outside
of
one
attempt
make
by
a
group
of
builder
in
the
late
twenty
no
manufacturer
in
this
country
other
than
ourselves
brought
out
a
diesel
power
freight
locomotive
until
after
world
war
ii
aside
from
switcher
it
might
be
say
we
be
first
everywhere
on
the
railroad
of
this
country
with
diesel
power
to
suggest
as
a
senate
subcommittee
do
in
that
we
shove
ourselves
into
the
locomotive
market
by
main
force
be
to
ignore
the
fact
that
other
manufacturer
fail
to
see
the
potential
of
the
diesel
as
mr
kettering
once
remark
during
another
congressional
investigation
our
big
advantage
in
the
locomotive
industry
be
the
fact
that
our
competitor
thought
we
be
crazy
yet
the
superiority
of
diesel
power
over
steam
be
apparent
from
the
begin
rudolph
diesel
first
mention
this
superiority
in
railroad
application
in
and
numerous
time
afterward
during
the
late
s
engineering
and
railroad
journal
be
carry
full
report
and
operating
cost
data
on
diesel
locomotive
then
in
operation
in
europe
to
anyone
who
would
listen
we
could
prove
that
the
diesel
offer
smoother
faster
cleaner
service
and
an
enormous
save
in
fuel
and
other
operating
cost
the
railroad
which
be
eager
to
trim
their
operating
cost
in
every
way
possible
during
the
s
listen
eagerly
the
other
locomotive
manufacturer
continued
to
regard
the
diesel
as
a
sort
of
passing
fad
this
explains
why
a
group
of
long
establish
economically
strong
locomotive
manufacturer
with
strong
tie
to
their
customer
be
so
easily
outdistance
by
one
newcomer
to
the
business
it
be
not
until
the
mid
s
that
the
building
of
steam
locomotive
in
this
country
stop
completely
with
production
in
the
closing
year
go
largely
to
export
less
than
a
hundred

use

this
revolution
in
the
railroad
industry
in
the
united

be
make
very
largely
by
general
motor
it
be
hard
to
make
precise
statement
about
the
future
of
the
diesel
locomotive
business
but
it
appear
that
the
market
in
the
united
state
will
be
somewhat
small
in
the
year
ahead
railroad
passenger
service
be
be
discontinue
in
many
area
of
the
country
and
even
freight
carloadings
have
decline
somewhat
in
recent
year
there
be
about
percent
more
steam
locomotive
in
service
during
the
mid
s
than
there
be
diesel
today
this
fact
reflect
the
great
power
and
operating
availability
of
the
diesel
of
course
but
it
also
reflect
the
depressed
condition
of
the
railroad
overseas
there
still
be
some
steam
locomotive
in
operation
these
eventually
will
be
replace
by
diesel
electric

the
potential
market
for
diesel
electric

overseas

approximately

the
electro

have
developed
a

the

be
of

an
increasingly

the
curious
story
of
how
general
motor
get
into
the
refrigerator
business
begin
in
june
when
mr
durant
who
be
then
president
of
the
corporation
purchase
the
guardian
frigerator
company
of
detroit
mr
durant
make
the
purchase
in
his
own
name
and
with
his
own
fund
the
precise
amount
be
the
company
pass
from
mr
durant
to
general
motor
in
may
at
the
same
price
it
be
a
small
enterprise
of
no
great
substance
he
soon
rename
the
company
the
frigidaire
corporation
and
also
give
the
name
frigidaire
to
the
rather
crude
primitive
device
which
be
then
its
sole
product
mr
durant
s
motif
in
this
transaction
be
not
within
my
knowledge
but
he
be
of
course
a
man
of
boundless
enthusiasm
and
great
curiosity
and
it
be
easy
to
understand
that
an
iceless
frigerator
as
the
guardian
product
be
call
would
excite
both
of
these
quality
i
can
only
admire
his
gift
for
be
in
touch
with
future
development
in
this
as
well
as
the
automotive
field
while
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
mr
durant
s
transaction
at
the
time
it
take
place
john
l
pratt
have
told
me
that
in
his
opinion
more
than
enthusiasm
for
a
new
appliance
underlay
the
purchase
he
say
that
mr
durant
be
concerned
about
the
prospect
of
the
automobile
business
be
declare
unessential
to
our
world
war
i
mobilization
effort
and
be
look
for
an
essential
business
to
take
the
place
of

automobile
give
the
great
national
effort
to
conserve
food
during
world
war
i
a
refrigerator
company
might
be
consider
essential
however
the
government
make
no
effort
to
end
automobile
production
and
in
november
five
month
after
his
purchase
have
be
make
the

end
the
original

be

by
a

in
the
follow
year
he
organize
the

in

to
manufacture

sell
his

between
april
and

and
a

in

to

the

mr

personally
service
them
he
kept
in
close
touch
with
the
purchaser
visit
each
of
them
every
two
or
three
week
as
we
ascertain
at
the
time
we
bought
frigidaire
most
of
these
early
guardian
customer
be
pleased
with
the
product
many
of
them
have
in
fact
despite
the
numerous
service
problem
invest
in
mr
mellowes
company
but
as
investor
it
appear
they
be
less
happily
situate
than
they
be
as
consumer
during
its
first
twenty
three
month
guardian
show
a
loss
of
in
the
three
month
just
before
mr
durant
bought
it
the
company
lose
another

its
total
deficit
to
less
than
forty
refrigerator
have
be
built
and
sell
in
the
entire
period
it
be
not
difficult
to
understand
why
the
original
shareholder
be
happy
to
sell
out
when
frigidaire
pass
into
general
motor
we
tool
up
in
our
northway
plant
in
detroit
to
manufacture
frigidaire
model
a
a
machine
which
be
identical
to
the
old
guardian
except
for
minor
mechanical
change
our
miscalculation
about
the
product
s
suitability
for
mass
consumption
be
speedily
brought
home
to
us
model
a
and
its
successor
in
the
first
few
year
remain
a
luxury
product
what
be
bad
we
could
not
get
the
bug
out
of
the
machine
which
broke
down
repeatedly
our
effort
to
introduce
a
sale
and
service
organization
into
a
number
of
city
outside
of
detroit
be
largely
unsuccessful
it
appear
that
the
machine
really
need
the
kind
of
steady
personal
service
that
mr
mellowes
have
provide
his
small
group
of
customer
but
this
kind
of
service
be
obviously
impossible
in
a
product
intend
for
a
mass
market
after
about
a
year
and
a
half
we
seriously
consider
whether
the
frigidaire
operation
might
not
be
jettison
something
of
our
frame
of
mind
may
be
sense
from
the
minute
of
a
meeting
which
take
place
in
my
office
on
february
the
summary
of
my
remark
include
these
comment
frigidaire
corporation
locate
at
detroit
mich
and
make
frigidaires
which
up
to
the
present
have
be
a
failure
model
have
be
change
frequently
in
order
to
create
demand
but
without
success
branch
be
open
at
various
point
which
have
since
be
discontinue
loss
to
date
about
inventory
be
about
total
loss
expect
to
run
about
in
a
year
when
general
motor
be
in
serious
need
of
operating
capital
the
continued
loss
and
relatively
high
inventory
could
not
long
be
tolerate
and
it
be
possible
that
frigidaire
would
somehow
have
be
dispose
of
then
except
for
one
fortuitous
circumstance
upon
which
hang
a
story
in
an
earlier
chapter
i
told
how
general
motor
in
acquire
the
dayton
property
with
which
mr
kettering
be
associate
among
these
property
be
the
domestic
engineering
company
and
the
dayton
metal
product
company
the
domestic
engineering
company
later
rename
the
delco
light
company
be
a
manufacturer
of
home
light
plant
which
be
sell
mostly
to
farmer
the
dayton
metal
product
company
an
armament
manufacturing
concern
have
begin
research
in
the
refrigeration
field
early
in
as
part
of
a
program
design
to
obtain
a
product
which
might
keep
the
company
in
operation
when
the
war
end
and
the
armament
business
cease
the
two
enterprise
domestic
engineering
and
dayton
metal
product
be
in
the
appliance
business
in
some
item
and
be
prepare
to
expand
into
some
other
item
with
these
enterprise
general
motor
also
acquire
all
of
the
refrigeration
development
of
mr
kettering
s
research
group
this
informal
research
organization
continued
operation
at
dayton
until
june
when
the
subsidiary
general
motor
research
corporation
be
organize
general
motor
thus
acquire
some
outstanding
engineer
in
this
field
as
well
as
the
management
and
sale
ability
of
richard
h
grant
who
be
to
contribute
importantly
to
the
success
of
frigidaire
in
the
early
and
middle
s
all
of
these
factor
come
together
in
our
decision
during
the
slump
of
to
continue
with
frigidaire
it
be
clear
that
we
have
at
dayton
the
research
background
and
an
organization
to
back
up
the
frigidaire
development
delco
light
have
available
a
fine
sale
force
spread
over
large
area
of
the
country
and
some
unused
manufacturing
capacity
which
could
be
make
suitable
for
the
production
of
refrigerator
so
we
move
frigidaire
to
dayton
combine
its
operation
with
those
of
delco
light
and
start
on
a
new
course
in
the
refrigerator
industry
on
a
large
scale
than
theretofore
the
decision
prove
to
be
a
sound
one
frigidaire
s
heavy
loss
in
be
reduce
steadily
in
the
next
two
year
and
in
the
operation
show
a
profit
for
the
first
time
meanwhile
production
rise
rapidly
only
a
few
more
than
a
thousand
unit
have
be
produce
in
at
the
northway
plant
about
be
sell
in
the
first
full
year
of
operation
at
dayton
the
figure
rise
to
in
in
and
in
by
the
last
year
frigidaire
be
establish
as
a
lead
factor
in
the
new
refrigerator
industry
it
represent
i
believe
more
than
half
of
the
market
by
it
be
apparent
that
frigidaire
be
become
much
too
big
to
be
operate
within
delco
light
and
in
january
it
be
remove
from
that
company
part
of
its
operation
have
already
be
move
to
nearby
moraine
ohio
where
we
have
a
plant
available
frigidaire
become
a
division
of
general
motor
in
december
once
we
have
decide
to
build
up
frigidaire
we
make
a
number
of
major
ground
break
advance
in
the
design
and
manufacture
of
the
machine
without
these
contribution
it
be
safe
to
say
popular
acceptance
of
the
refrigerator
would
have
be
delayed
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
as
i
have
indicate
the
guardian
organization
originally
have
no
real
research
staff
outside
of
mr
mellowes
himself
even
in
when
frigidaire
be
move
into
delco
light
there
be
only
twenty
odd
engineer
modelmakers
tester
and
the
like
engage
in
this
work
we
realize
that
the
whole
future
of
frigidaire
depend
on
our
ability
to
crack
several
research
problem
and
to
produce
a
machine
that
would
operate
safely
economically
and
dependably
hence
we
place
great
emphasis
on
research
we
soon
manage
to
get
rid
of
the
space
consume
brine
tank
and
water
cool
compressor
use
on
the
original
guardian
machine
these
device
which
be
major
source
of
refrigerator
breakdown
be
replace
by
a
direct
expansion
coil
and
a
two
cylinder
air
cool
compressor
in
the
early
machine
food
be
sometimes
contaminate
when
moisture
leak
into
the
refrigerator
we
overcame
this
problem
by
introduce
asphalt
and
cork
seal
we
reduce
the
weight
of
the
machine
and
considerably
improve
its
appearance
when
we
introduce
the
all
porcelain
cabinet
in
all
of
these
improvement
be
instrumental
in
the
great
expansion
of
the
frigidaire
market
during
the
s
another
major
cause
of
this
expansion
be
our
ability
to
get
price
down
the
b
wood
refrigerator
with
brine
tank
and
water
cool
compressor
have
a

a

and

during
the

no

research
problem
in
frigidaire
and
the
corporation
s
great
ultimate
contribution
concerned
the
refrigerant
itself
the
fact
be
during
the
s
that
the
refrigerant
use
by
frigidaire
and
by
all
its
lead
competitor
have
some
health
hazard
fume
from
the
refrigerate
agent
be
toxic
and
in
a
few
case
have
actually
cause
the
death
of
person
who
breathe
them
because
of
the
health
hazard
these
early
refrigerator
be
sometimes
kept
on
the
back
porch
rather
than
in
the
kitchen
hospital
generally
could
not
use
them
at
all
we
believe
that
sulphur
dioxide
the
agent
first
use
in
our
refrigerator
be
the
least
dangerous
of
the
know
refrigerant
principally
because
its
distinctly
irritate
odor
serve
as
a
warn
to
anyone
breathing
it
nevertheless
it
be
clear
that
ultimately
something
well
have
to
be
found
in
mr
kettering
who
be
then
director
of
general
motor
research
laboratory
initiate
a
major
assault
on
the
whole
problem
of
the
refrigerate
agent
he
commission
one
of
his
former
associate
in
general
motor
thomas
midgley
jr
the
man
who
have
developed
tetraethyl
lead
to
find
a
new
agent
after
a
series
of
conference
between
mr
midgley
mr
kettering
and
frigidaire
executive
they
agree
that
the
refrigerant
they
be
look
for
should
meet
certain
requirement
these
be
of
primary
importance
to
have
a
suitable
boil
point
to
be
nonpoisonous
to
be
nonflammable
to
have
a
distinct
but
not
unpleasant
odor
of
secondary
importance
to
be
immiscible
with
lubricate
oil
to
be
relatively
inexpensive
these
secondary
requirement
it
be
understood
would
be
met
so
long
as
they
do
not
conflict
with
the
primary
requirement
but
there
be
agreement
that
all
of
the
first
four
specification
have
to
be
met
before
the
electric
refrigerator
could
be
regard
as
a
complete
success
a
study
of
all
exist
literature
be
make
at
the
research
laboratory
under
mr
kettering
s
direction
for
compound
which
might
meet
these
specification
this
study
point
out
the
possibility
of
use
fluorinated
hydrocarbon
all
through
mr
midgley
and
some
associate
especially
dr
a
l
henne
work
in
a
private
laboratory
in
dayton
in
an
effort
to
find
a
suitable
refrigerant
they
soon
come
to
believe
that
some
of
the
chlorofluoro
derivative
of
methane
might
do
the
job
by
the
end
of
the
year
mr
midgley
have
determine
that
dichloro
difluoro
methane
call
freon
would
meet
all
four
of
the
primary
requirement
agree
upon
it
would
not
meet
either
of
the
two
secondary
requirement
but
since
it
be
clearly
the
best
refrigerant
available
mr
midgley
and
his
associate
begin
work
on
the
development
of
process
for
manufacturing
the
compound
a
pilot
plant
be
design
and
put
in
operation
at
dayton
during
the
fall
and
winter
of
in
the
fall
of
we
knew
as
much
about
the
freon
refrigerant
as
we
have
to
know
frigidaire
chemist
have
make
exhaustive
study
of
the
compound
s
physical
property
they
have
determine
the
corrosion
effect
of
freon
on
high
and
low
carbon
steel
aluminum
copper
monel
metal
tin
zinc
tin
lead
solder
and
other
metal
and
alloy
use
in
refrigerate
system
they
have
examine
the
effect
of
freon
on
different
food
and
on
flower
and
fur
the
test
be
satisfactory
to
us
at
the
meeting
of
the
american
chemical
society
mr
midgley
read
a
paper
on
freon
and
publicly
demonstrate
that
it
be
nonflammable
he
prove
that
it
be
nontoxic
by
inhale
some
of
it
himself
as
i
have
indicate
freon
do
not
meet
either
of
mr
midgley
s
two
secondary
requirement
it
be
quite
expensive
in
fact
whereas
sulphur
dioxide
have
cost
six
cent
a
pound
the
initial
price
of
freon
be
sixty
one
cent
in
even
now
it
cost
more
than
sulphur
dioxide
do
then
but
health
department
code
do
not
allow
the
use
of
the
latter
since
we
regard
our
new
compound
as
the
safest
refrigerant
available
we
offer
it
to
our
competitor
from
the
begin
and
by
the
mid
s
freon
be
use
almost
universally
in
electric
refrigerator
even
today
no
well
refrigerant
have
be
found
by
or
thereabouts
it
be
unmistakably
clear
to
us
that
in
frigidaire
we
have
a
property
of
vast
growth
potential
in
we
have
manufacture
our
one
millionth
frigidaire
and
three
year
later
we
have
manufacture
our
success
in
develop
freon
remove
the
last
roadblock
stand
in
the
way
of
the
refrigerator
industry
but
while
it
be
clear
that
frigidaire
and
the
industry
would
expand
it
be
also
clear
that
frigidaire
s
share
of
this
great
market
must
inevitably
decline
somewhat
several
company
would
begin
make
refrigerator
toward
the
end
of
the
s
kelvinator
be
of
course
a
pioneer
the
original
kelvinator
corporation
enter
the
electric
refrigerator
field
in
and
be
the
first
enterprise
to
manufacture
mechanical
refrigerator
for
household
use
on
a
commercial
scale
general
electric
and
norge
enter
the

in

in
by
the

frigidaire

the
refrigerator
market
which
have
be
above
percent
in
the

be
down
to
to
percent
but
our
small
percentage
represent
a
large
volume
shipment
of
our
refrigerator
rise
from
some
in
to
in
during
the
year
a
number
of
frigidaire
s
competitor
gain
an
advantage
over
us
in
the
marketing
area
they
begin
to
make
and
sell
radio
electric
range
washer
ironers
and
dishwasher
while
frigidaire
concentrate
on
refrigerator
in
we
add

range
to
the
frigidaire
line
and
a
few
year
later
window

these
do
little
to
overcome

obviously

home

who
want
to

in
the

before
the

as
early
as
for
example
mr

have
suggest
that
frigidaire
get
more
actively
into

conditioning
but
his
suggestion
do
not
register
on
us
and
the
proposal
be
not
then
adopt
during
the
war
we
make
a
review
of
frigidaire
s
prospect
and
conclude
that
it
would
no
longer
be
feasible
to
operate
in
the

on
a
limited

a

that

i
be

for
some
detailed

in
that
come
pretty
close

have
be
involve
in
the
aviation
industry
in
several
different
way
the
bulk
of
our
aviation
business
have
be
military
of
course
and
have
consist
of
work
do
under

for
the

most
of
it
during
world
war
ii
and
in
the

year
of
the

but
that
be
not
the
whole
story
it
will
i
suspect
come
as
a
surprise
to
many
reader
that
general

north
american

all
owe
something

to
the
activity
of
general

our
venture
into
commercial
aviation
be
make
in
in
that
year
we
make
two
large
investment
and
one
small
one
in

we
purchase
a

a
percent

in
the

together
these
investment
cost
us
some
million
in
addition
we
purchase
the
entire

of
the
allison

this

only
and
do
not

we

then
to
enter
the
aviation

our
decision
to
get
into

have
an
interest
background
i
should
mention
that
general

be
not
entirely
a
stranger
to
the
aviation

at
that
time
during

i
buick

on
our

at
the
time
of
the

from

there
be
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
those
day
between
an
airplane

and
an
automobile

we
be
able
in
consequence
to
make
good
use
of
our
automotive
experience
in
compile
an
outstanding

body
also
before
its
purchase
by
general
motor
be
an
important
manufacturer
of
military
airplane
during
the
s
it
become
steadily
clearer
that
aviation
be
to
be
one
of
the
great
american
growth
industry
and
especially
after
lindbergh
s
dramatic
flight
in
there
be
a
vast
public
enthusiasm
for
aviation
and
a
widespread
conviction
which
we
share
that
it
would
soon
accomplish
many
more
miracle
as
automobile
producer
we
be
especially
concerned
about
one
possible
use
of
the
airplane
there
be
in
the
late
s
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
develop
a
flivver
plane
that
be
a
small
plane
for
everyday
family
use
we
knew
of
course
that
any
such
plane
would
have
to
be
much
safer
than
exist
model
and
also
much
cheaper
but
as
one
aviation
miracle
succeed
another
our
conviction
grow
that
the
flivver
plane
be
at
least
a
possibility
the
development
of
such
a
plane
would
have
large
unforeseeable
consequence
for
the
automobile
industry
and
we
felt
that
we
have
to
gain
some
protection
by
declare
ourselves
in
the
aviation
industry
in
we
do
not
plan
to
operate
either
bendix
or
fokker
as
a
division
of
general
motor
our
investment
be
make
as
a
mean
of
maintain
a
direct
and
continue
contact
with
development
in
aviation
our
annual
report
to
shareholder
sum
up
our
think
on
the
matter
as
follow
general
motor
in
form
this
association
with
the
aviation
industry
felt
that
in
view
of
the
more
or
less
close
relationship
in
an
engineering
way
between
the
airplane
and
the
motor
car
its
operating
organization
technical
and
otherwise
should
be
place
in
a
position
whore
it
would
have
an
opportunity
to
come
into
contact
with
the
specific
problem
involve
in
transportation
by
air
what
the
future
of
the
airplane
may
be
no
one
can
positively
state
at
this
time
through
this
association
general
motor
will
be
able
to
evaluate
the
development
of
the
industry
and
determine
its
future
policy
with
a
more
definite
knowledge
of
the
fact
as
these
word
suggest
the
engineering
technique
of
the
automobile
and
aircraft
industry
be
still
quite
similar
in
much
more
similar
than
they
be
today
thus
in
acquire
our
interest
in
the
aviation
company
we
also
gain
access
to
some
valuable
technical
information
that
be
directly
relevant
to
our
own
automobile
operation
bendix
especially
own
or
control
some
important
patent
for
device

our
principal

fokker
a
brilliant
dutch
aircraft
builder
have
form
the
company
some
time
earlier
to
exploit
the
american
manufacturing
right
to
his
work
his
aircraft
have
figure
prominently
in
the
pioneer
day
of
aviation
they
have
be
involve
in
such
historic
event
as
the
first
nonstop
flight
across
the
united
state
byrd
s
flight
over
the
north
pole
and
the
first
flight
from
the

to

when
we
bought
into
fokker
the
company

engage
primarily
in
aircraft
manufacture
for
the
united

and
to
a
lesser
extent
for
commercial
air
transport
operator
soon
after
our
investment
the
company
incur
some
serious
operating
loss
we
felt
that
these
loss
reflect
weakness
in
the
company
s
management
and
we
conveyed
our
view
to
mr
fokker
he
do
not
agree
with
us
but
after
a
series
of
exchange
he
withdrew
from
the
company
and
return
to
holland
we
then
embark
upon
a
course
of
action
which
completely
transform
the
character
of
the
organization
the
follow
interrelationship
be
complex
and
i
see
no
way
to
simplify
the
description
of
them
first
of
all
we
change
the
name
of
the
fokker
aircraft
corporation
of
america
to
general
aviation
manufacturing
corporation
and
consolidated
the
operation
in
a
lease
plant
in
dundalk
maryland
in
april
we
take
another
important
step
we
combine
general
aviation
and
north
american
aviation
all
of
general
aviation
s
asset
be
exchange
for
approximately
share
of
north
american
common
stock
general
aviation
be
subsequently
liquidate
and
its
holding
in
north
american
stock
distribute
to
the
shareholder
as
a
result
of
this
distribution
and
of
open
market
purchase
for
our
own
account
general
motor
equity
in
north
american
amount
to
nearly
percent
of
that
company
s
outstanding
stock
by
the
end
of
north
american
aviation
have
be
organize
as
a
hold
company
in
although
it
have
some
substantial
investment
in
aircraft
manufacturing
company
even
before
it
be
join
with
general
aviation
its
primary
concern
have
be
the
airline
business
it
own
all
of
eastern
air
transport
later
call
eastern
air
line
percent
of
transcontinental
air
transport
and
percent
of
western
air
express
corporation
general
aviation
have
also
own
percent
of
western
air
express
stock
afterward
therefore
north
american
own
percent
of
western
air
express
stock
furthermore
western
air
express
and
transcontinental
air
transport
each
own
percent
of
the
stock
of
transcontinental
and
western
air
inc
now
trans
world
airline
the
upshot
of
the
arrangement
then
be
that
general
motor
held
a
percent
interest
in
north
american
and
north
american
held
about
a
percent
interest
in
twa
north
american
be
thereby
enable
to
coordinate
the
transcontinental
operation
of
twa
with
the
east
coast
system
of
its
own
eastern

company
by

engage
either
directly
or
through
a
subsidiary
in

therefore
distribute
its
holding
in
twa
to
its
shareholder
as
a
shareholder
of
north
american
general
motor
receive

which
we
sell
in
for
a
time
north
american
operate
eastern
air
line
as
a
division
and
then
dispose
of
this
airline
in
march
as
the
large
single

in
north

during
the

in
his
behalf
i
have
always
consider
eddie
to
be
a
capable
operator
and
i
naturally
want
him
to
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
bid
for
eastern
i
felt
that
he
could
be
count
on
to
develop
an
efficient
operation
i
told
him
i
would
see
what

thirty
day
to

backing
which
would
enable
him
to
bid
he
do
not
get
his
backing
very
easily
however
and
as
the
deadline
approach
he
become
understandably
nervous
about
the
outcome
the
next
to
the
last
day
fell
on
a
saturday
eddie
call
me
at
my
apartment
as

be
prepare

a
few
minute
when
he
arrive
he
indicate
that
his
prospect
for
get
the
money
be
still
excellent
but
that
he
might
need
more
time
he
wonder
if
he
could
have
a
few
day
extension
i
told
him
not
to
worry
and
he
left
in
good
spirit
but
as
it
turn
out
he
do
not
need
the
extension
his
backer
call
him
the
next
morning
and
told
him
that
they
be
prepared
to
go
through
with
the
deal
this
disposal
by
north
american
of
its
eastern
air
line
operation
be
a
transaction
that
give
us
all
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
in
the
reorganization
that
follow
the

during
the
ensue

the

place
emphasis
on
the
development
of

and
make
some
notable
stride
in
that
direction
in
the
late
s
the
company
won
several
military
design
competition
and
these
success
establish
it
as
one
of

a
number
of

from

a
vital
part
in

among
the
more
famous
of

at
by
the
way
reflect
the
general

influence
on
north
american
as
automobile
men
we
naturally
thought
in
term
of
standardize

which
could
realize
the
inherent
economy
of
volume
production
north
american
begin
look
for
a
plane
that
could
be
market
this
way
and
soon
decide
that
a
good
basic
training
plane
be
the
best
bet
even
before
the
war
the
at

be
continuously

from
until
we
finally
dispose
of
our
interest
in

that
time
and
especially
in
the
earlier
year
we
provide
a
considerable
amount
of
policy
and
administrative
guidance
through
our
representative
on

and
we
be
instrumental
i

in
develop
an
efficient
systematic
approach
to
management
in
the
company
north

s
corporate
organization
and
its
financial
production
and
cost
control
be
our
special
contribution
it
appear
that
in
north
american
be
the
only
aircraft
manufacturing
company
with
production
and
cost
control
system
like
those

in
the
automobile
industry
a
major
share
of
the
credit
for

technique
at

great
talent
for

as
well
he
be

into
a
large
manufacturing
operation
in
addition
he
become
a
director
of

in
i
have
always
consider
mr

to
be
an
excellent
prospect
for
top
management
and
have
try
for
some
time
to
bring
him
into
a
good
operating
position
in

and
later
president
of

who
still
regard
mr

as
a
financial
man
but
finally
in
i
found
a
spot
for
him
as
group

at
bendix
again
he
perform
brilliantly
all
during
the
war
year
and
more
than
justified
my
faith
in
him
but
the
story
of
his
career
have
an
ironic
twist
as
many
person
know
in
perform
so
well
in
all
his
general

assignment
he

in
and
introduce

to
be
recognize
as
a
man
who
could
produce
outstanding

but
he
have
have
very
little
general
administrative
experience
before
come
to

and
recognize
his

have
change
considerably
our
original
motive
for

feel
that
the

might
somehow
produce
a
flivver

could
compete
with
the

to
seem
less
relevant
as
the

pass
no

suitable
for

use
be
ever
developed
indeed
the
whole

field
remain
a
small
one
during
the
year
of
the
depression
north

to
grow
but
both
company
discover
that
their
great
opportunity
lay
in
the
military
field
by
each
company
have
annual
sale
run
around
million
and
the
great
bulk
of
this
be
defense
work
do
under
government
contract
in
at
the
peak
of
wartime
production
north
american
s
sale
be
about
million
and
bendix
s
sale
come
to
more
than
million
these
huge
figure
suggest
the
far
reach
consequence
for
us
of
our
original
concern
about
the
flivver
plane
the
allison
engineering
company
which
we
also
acquire
in
have
have
a
growth
history
no
less
spectacular
than
north
american
and
bendix
as
i
have
mention
we
purchase
allison
outright
for
only
by
our
standard
it
be
a
small
operation
the
company
have
few
than
employee
in
and
its
manufacturing
facility
occupy
only
about
square
foot
of
floor
space
we
consider
it
to
be
of
only
minor
importance
in
our
plan
to
enter
the
aviation
industry
yet
as
event
turn
out
we
be
to
make
allison
our
principal
link
to
the
industry
when
we
acquire
allison
in
the
company
have
be
in
existence
for
fourteen
year
in
its
early
year
it
be
not
in
the
aviation
field
it
be
primarily
a
support
machine
shop
for
race
car
at
the
indianapolis
speedway
its
founder
james
a
allison
gradually
shape
an
organization
of
skilled
mechanic
machinist
and
engineer
and
begin
to
produce
a
few
marine
engine
and
reduction
gear
for
boat
and
aircraft
in
the
early
s
allison
be
able
to
accept
a
contract
for
the
modification
of
world
war
i
liberty
aircraft
engine
chronic
failure
in
the
crankshaft
and
connect
rod
bearing
have
seriously
limited
the
durability
of
these
engine
but
allison
be
able
to
develop
a
steel
back
lead
bronze
crankshaft
main
bearing
that
be
capable
of
support
high
horsepower
load
without
failure
the
company
also
developed
an
ingenious
method
of
cast
lead
bronze
on
both
the
inner
and
outer
surface
of
a
steel
shell
which
could
be
use
in
make
connect
rod
bearing
of
great
durability
these
development
be
the
basis
for
the
highly
regard
allison
bearing
that
come
to
be
use
extensively
in
high
horsepower
engine
throughout
the
world
the
production
of
this
bearing
and
the
contract
to
modify
liberty
engine
account
for
the
principal
business
of
the
company
during
the
s
when
mr
allison
die
in
the
company
be
put
up
for
sale
on
the
condition
that
operation
must
continue
in
indianapolis
several
prospective
buyer
be
approach
but
none
be
willing
to
accept
this
stipulation
fortunately
c
e
wilson
have
become
well
acquaint
with
the
allison
organization
while
he
be
general
manager
of
the
delco
remy
division
in
anderson
indiana
he
knew
that
the
organization
possess
valuable
mechanical
skill
that
we
could
use
we
have
no
objection
to
continue
operation
in
indianapolis
and
on
mr
wilson
s
recommendation
we
approve
the
purchase
in
early
norman
h
gilman
who
have
be
president
and
chief
engineer
under
mr
allison
continued
in
charge
as
general
manager
after
our
acquisition
early
in
the
s
allison
embark
upon
a
project
which
prove
to
be
of
great
military
significance
this
be
the
v
engine
project
and
it
be
initiate
by
mr
gilman
after
a
careful
survey
of
all
the
military
aircraft
engine
then
in
existence
mr
gilman
conclude
that
the
arm
service
would
one
day
require
a
reciprocate
engine
of
horsepower
he
also
conclude
that
the
engine
should
be
liquid
cool
which
would
give
it
a
slimmer
shape
than
an
air
cool
engine
only
very
meager
fund
for
such
project
be
available
from
the
military
in
the
early
s
but
mr
gilman
do
win
a
small
contract
and
allison
set
to
work
design
the
engine
a
partial
success
be
achieve
in
with
a
l
horsepower
engine
that
function
well
for
about
fifty
hour
however
the
engineer
could
not
get
the
engine
to
function
for
hour
which
army
specification
require
to
speed
up
development
work
on
the
engine
we
assign
ronald
m
hazen
an
outstanding
engineer
with
the
general
motor
research
laboratory
to
work
at
allison
mr
hazen
s
effort
be
successful
and
on
april
the
v
pass
all
the
test
require
by
the
army
air
corp
it
be
the
first
airplane
engine
in
the
united
state
to
qualify
at
horsepower
and
the
nation
s
first
really
successful
high
temperature
liquid
cool
engine
until
the
v
engine
be
developed
the
air
corp
have
take
for
grant
the
superiority
of
the
air
cool
engine
but
the
allison
engine
quickly
prove
its
worth
in
march
a
curtis
p
power
by
a
v
engine
won
the
air
corp
fighter
aircraft
race
with
a
clear
speed
advantage
of
forty
mile
per
hour
over
the
previous
winner
there
be
naturally
a
sudden
great
surge
of
interest
in
the
allison
engine
after
that
event
not
only
the
u
s
air
corp
but
the
arm
force
of
britain
and
france
begin
to
look
closely
at
our
product
allison
now
have
a
serious
problem
though
we
have
built
it
up
somewhat
since
the
year
of
our
acquisition
it
be
still
essentially
a
small
engineering
firm
gear
mainly
to
experimental
work
with
no
facility
at
all
for
quantity
production
and
quantity
production
at
the
end
of
the
s
be
be
desperately
demand
by
the
government
the
assistant
secretary
of
war
louis
johnson
personally
visit
mr
knudsen
who
be
then
president
of
general
motor
to
see
what
could
be
do
about
produce
allison
engine
at
that
time
there
be
firm
order
for
only
engine
and
as
mr
johnson
concede
he
be
in
no
position
to
assure
us
that
more
order
would
be
forthcoming
view
simply
as
a
business
proposition
building
a
factory
to
make
engine
seem
to
be
a
bad
risk
indeed
there
be
the
risk
that
some
new
turn
in
the
international
situation
or
some
new
technological
breakthrough
might
wipe
out
even
this
small
demand
before
our
factory
be
built
nevertheless
we
decide
after
weigh
the
matter
closely
to
establish
a
new
allison
plant
in
indianapolis
this
decision
be
base
on
a
feel
that
the
v
engine
would
probably
be
in
great
demand
moreover
one
do
not
lightly
turn
down
any
government
request
have
to
do
with
national
security
and
so
on
may
we
broke
ground
in
the
shadow
of
the
indianapolis
speedway
for
a
new
plant
to
build
the
allison
engine
as
it
happen
more
order
for
the
v
do
follow
the
french
government
order
of
the
engine
in
february
and
the
british
order
another
a
few
month
later
by
december
allison
be
produce
engine
at
the
rate
of
a
month
during
the
war
we
force
this
rate
still
high
even
though
the
engine
be
be
continually
redesign
and
repowered
until
it
finally
attain
a
combat
rating
of
some
horsepower
by
december
when
we
stop
make
the
v
engine
total
production
be
up
to
engine
they
have
perform
brilliantly
all
during
the
war
and
be
use
on
such
famous
fighter
plane
as
the
curtis
p
warhawk
the
bell
p
aircobra
the
bell
p
king
cobra
and
the
lockheed
p
lightning
early
in
the
war
it
become
apparent
that
our
involvement
in
aviation
be
so
large
as
to
raise
a
question
about
our
permanent
place
in
the
industry
accordingly
we
make
an
effort
to
redefine
our
think
about
aviation
and
the
part
we
should
play
in
it
the
principal
statement
on
this
important
matter
be
a
report
which
i
make
in
to
the
postwar
planning
group
in
general
motor
the
recommendation
in
this
report
be
eventually
adopt
by
the
corporation
s
policy
committee
and
they
become
the
basis
for
our
postwar
aviation
program
in
the
report
i
indicate
that
there
would
be
three
major
market
in
the
postwar
aircraft
industry
military
commercial
air
transport
and
private
civilian
fly
i
then
raise
the
question
whether
we
want
to
participate
in
any
or
all
of
these
market
as
producer
of
complete
aircraft
i
point
out
that
the
manufacture
of
military
aircraft
would
involve
a
large
amount
of
engineering
and
development
work
with
continuous
modification
of
low
volume
model
moreover
there
would
undoubtedly
be
excess
capacity
in
the
industry
result
in
severe
competition
for
whatever
business
do
exist
with
little
prospect
for
anything
more
than
a
small
margin
of
profit
in
the
commercial
transport
field
i
foresaw
a
rapid
acceleration
of
transportation
by
air
not
only
for
passenger
but
for
freight
as
well
even
in
this
expand
market
however
the
potential
sale
volume
available
to
a
manufacturer
would
be
limited
i
assume
that
there
would
be
something
on
the
order
of
a
tenfold
increase
in
the
number
of
transport
plane
in
use
roughly
plane
altogether
but
with
an
average
life
span
of
perhaps
five
year
for
each
plane
the
potential
volume
available
to
a
single
producer
in
any
one
year
would
not
be
great
i
be
also
dubious
about
the
advisability
of
our
manufacturing
small
private
plane
while
i
believe
that
there
would
be
some
postwar
expansion
in
the
market
for
these
plane
for
both
business
and
personal
use
i
felt
that
growth
in
this
area
would
be
limited
until
technology
have
advanced
to
a
point
where
a
far
great
degree
of
safety
could
be
attain
i
state
that
unless
there
be
some
revolutionary
breakthrough
on
safety
the
private
plane
would
not
become
a
serious
competitor
of
the
motorcar
in
the
foreseeable
future
in
short
none
of
the
three
aircraft
market
seem
invite
to
general
motor
furthermore
i
say
if
general
motor
get
into
the
business
of
manufacturing
complete
aircraft
we
might
jeopardize
the
other
aviation
business
of
the
corporation
our
allison
division
be
and
would
continue
to
be
a
major
producer
of
airplane
engine
and
certain
aircraft
accessory
in
general
these
accessory
with
comparatively
minor
variation
of
an
engineering
and
production
character
would
be
applicable
to
many
kind
of
plane
and
might
normally
account
for
some
to
percent
of
the
cost
of
a
complete
airplane
the
sale
potential
in
this
area
of
the
market
be
substantial
but
in
order
to
realize
this
potential
an
accessory
manufacturer
would
need
the
engineering
cooperation
and
confidence
of
the
aircraft
manufacturer
who
be
his
customer
if
we
be
produce
complete
aircraft
ourselves
we
would
have
difficulty
establish
such
a
relationship
with
our
customer
how
could
we
expect
an
airframe
manufacturer
engage
in
develop
a
new
plane
to
disclose
its
forward
design
to
an
accessory
producer
who
have
the
opportunity
to
make
use
of
these
design
as
a
competitor
in
short
it
seem
incomprehensible
to
me
that
we
could
expect
to
sell
our
accessory
successfully
and
at
the
same
time
compete
with
those
to
whom
we
must
sell
them
by
produce
one
or
more
type
of
airframe
ourselves
discussion
of
this
subject
continued
for
some
time
and
on
august
our
postwar
aviation
policy
be
formally
define
in
the
follow
resolution
of
the
corporation
s
policy
committee
first
the
corporation
should
not
contemplate
the
production
of
complete
airplane
in
either
the
military
or
transport
area
second
the
corporation
should
develop
as
complete
a
position
in
the
manufacture
of
accessory
as
its
capacity
and
circumstance
make
possible
the
reader
will
observe
that
we
do
not
at
this
time
specifically
exclude
the
possibility
of
our
manufacturing
a
small
plane
for
private
business
and
personal
use
we
still
doubt
that
volume
production
of
such
a
plane
would
be
possible
on
a
basis
attractive
to
general
motor
however
we
felt
we
could
not
ignore
the
possibility
completely
in
my
report
i
recommend
that
we
establish
a
program
to
keep
abreast
of
technological
development
in
the
small
plane
business
but
we
later
discard
the
idea
as
impracticable
however
north
american
aviation
do
go
on
to
design
and
manufacture
a
plane
for
individual
transportation
the
navion
the
formulation
of
our
postwar
aviation
policy
naturally
have
considerable
bearing
on
our
attitude
toward
our
investment
in
north
american
and
bendix
during
the
war
north
american
become
one
of
the
nation
s
lead
airframe
manufacturer
and
we
conclude
that
a
continued
investment
in
the
company
would
be
no
less
damage
to
general
motor
accessory
business
than
direct
manufacturing
of
airframe
ourselves
furthermore
it
become
increasingly
clear
that
general
motor
could
not
employ
its
mass
production
technique
effectively
in
the
airframe
industry
we
decide
therefore
that
it
would
be
in
the
best
interest

north
american
to
dispose
of
our
holding
in
the
company
at
some
appropriate
time
bendix
be
a
somewhat
different
proposition
this
company
already
held
a
strong
position
in
the
aviation
accessory
field
and
its
activity
fit
in
very
nicely
with
our
own
scheme
of
operation
and
postwar
policy
objective
at
one
point
we
give
very
serious
study
to
acquire
bendix
outright
and
operating
it
as
a
consolidated
division
or
subsidiary
of
general
motor
but
decide
against
it
we
gradually
arrive
at
a
general
policy
of
dispose
of
minority
interest
and
in
sell
our
interest
in
north
american
and
bendix
the
capital
thus
release
be
employ
in
our
rapidly
expand
automotive
operation
our
contribution
to
bendix
and
north
american
during
the
period
of
our
association
be
not
in
the
engineering
and
technological
field
they
be
in
the
more
intangible
area
of
business

chapter
contribution
to
national
defense
the
problem
of
defend
the
united
state
against
aggression
have
come
to
seem
a
permanent
one
and
as
each
year
pass
it
grows
increasingly
hard
to
envisage
a
time
in
which
we
would
not
have
to
maintain
our
vast
military
establishment
for
general
motor
and
for
hundred
of
other
corporation
defense
work
appear
to
be
one
of
the
inevitable
fact
of
modern
corporate
life
in
the
year
through
general
motor
defense
business
amount
to
between
million
and
million
a
year
or
about
percent
of
sale
important
but
relatively
not
large
and
not
comparable
to
what
general
motor
have
do
in
time
of
war
the
history
of
our
defense
work
have
several
episode
each
largely
unrelated
to
its
predecessor
four
distinct
period
be
involve
the
first
be
world
war
i
during
which
we
be
one
of
the
important
manufacturer
of
aircraft
engine
for
the
army
our
total
military
production
during
this
period
be
only
million
an
insignificant
amount
by
modern
military
standard
no
serious
effort
be
make
to
mobilize
the
corporation
during
the
war
we
produce
automobile
without
interruption
and
it
be
possible
to
regard
our
military
work
as
a
kind
of
temporary
sideline
when
world
war
i
end
so
do
our
military
activity
for
more
than
a
decade
we
have
very
little
defense
work
and
certainly
no
awareness
that
we
would
one
day
be
the
world
s
large
private
producer
of
military
hardware
this
unexpected
distinction
be
achieve
during
the
second
period
the
year
just
before
and
during
world
war
ii
in
this
period
we
produce
an
incredible
billion
of
military
good
most
of
this
production
be
compress
into
a
few
year
during
which
we
be
fully
mobilize
for
war
between
february
and
september
we
do
not
make
a
single
passenger
car
in
the
united
state
our
earlier
experience
in
world
war
i
be
largely
irrelevant
to
the
problem
we
face
in
world
war
ii
and
in
fact
i
can
think
of
only
a
few
lesson
learn
during
the
first
war
that
we
be
able
to
apply
during
the
second
one
of
these
for
example
concerned
the
rigid
control
of
inventory
and
commitment
in
line
with
definite
contractual
agreement
the
third
period
cover
roughly
the
korean
war
here
again
we
face
a
new
situation
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
virtually
all
our
military
business
have
cease
and
we
have
look
forward
to
a
time
in
which
we
could
devote
ourselves
substantially
to
make
automobile
and
other
commercial
product
however
we
propose
to
continue
close
liaison
with
the
arm
service
and
we
in
fact
continued
to
produce
a
few
military
item
this
work
be
concentrate
largely
at
allison
which
in
addition
to
its
aircraft
engine
begin
development
and
production
of
powershift
transmission
for
military
tactical
track
lay
vehicle
thus
in
june
when
the
korean
crisis
brought
new
demand
for
defense
production
allison
already
have
deliver
substantial
quantity
of
jet
engine
for
fighter
aircraft
and
be
produce
tank
transmission
in
addition
several
division
be
also
at
work
on
special
engineering
and
development
assignment
this
time
the
proposition
we
face
be
a
sort
of
partial
mobilization
the
government
reimpose
control
on
wage
and
price
and
it
restrict
the
use
of
some
material
for
example
rubber
and
copper
but
we
be
allow
to
continue
most
of
our
commercial
business
as
it
turn
out
our
military
product
account
for
no
more
than
percent
of
our
business
during
the
korean
war
however
we
be
kept
alert
to
the
possibility
that
full
mobilization
might
be
reimpose
and
we
have
to
plan
accordingly
the
fourth
period
the
present
one
be
quite
unlike
all
the
previous
period
and
it
have
require
still
another
adjustment
on
our
part
for
one
thing
military
technology
have
become
so
advanced
as
to
require
new
mode
of
production
and
new
kind
of
research
meanwhile
the
concept
of
total
mobilization
have
become
almost
archaic
we
know
now
that
we
will
never
again
be
fully
organize
for
war
it
be
generally
concede
that
if
there
be
another
major
war
it
will
be
over
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
our
world
war
ii
experience
with
full
mobilization
be
nevertheless
of
some
interest
i
think
few
people
realize
the
dimension
of
the
task
impose
on
us
then
or
the
manner
in
which
we
perform
it
to
begin
with
a
rather
obvious
point
general
motor
turn
out
a
different
product
during
a
war
in
this
respect
we
be
unlike
other
military
contractor
whose
conversion
to
war
production
involves
relatively
minor
change
clothing
manufacturer
for
example
can
make
uniform
for
the
arm
force
builder
can
make
barrack
or
set
up
housing
for
defense
worker
airframe
manufacturer
make
more
bomber
and
few
passenger
plane
but
only
a
small
proportion
of
general
motor
product
have
wartime
application
when
we
be
mobilize
during
world
war
ii
we
be
oblige
to
transform
the
great
bulk
of
our
operation
almost
completely
to
learn
rapidly
and
under
great
pressure
how
to
produce
tank
machine
gun
aircraft
propeller
and
many
other
kind
of
equipment
with
which
we
have
no
experience
at
all
we
have
to
refit
many
large
plant
and
retrain
hundred
of
thousand
of
worker
one
statistic
be
perhaps
worth
cite
of
the
billion
of
military
equipment
turn
out
by
general
motor
during
world
war
ii
more
than
billion
be
represent
by
product
that
be
entirely
new
to
us
we
be
able
to
do
this
because
we
be
decentralize
each
division
sought
its
own
contract
the
yearly
model
change
give
them
know
how
and
flexibility
in
another
way
too
perhaps
a
more
fundamental
way
our
business
be
transform
by
war
when
we
be
mobilize
for
war
we
operate
under
a
new
set
of
economic
and
other
rule
general
motor
at
war
become
an
entirely
different
organization
from
the
one
that
sell
automobile
in
peacetime
even
the
people
who
comprise
the
organization
be
different
more
than
of
our
employee
left
us
to
go
in
the
arm
force
during
world
war
ii
and
several
of
our
high
executive
serve
as
administrator
in
washington
prominently
mr
knudsen
who
be
make
one
of
the
head
of
war
production
this
change
in
the
character
of
general
motor
take
place
quite
suddenly
for
the
most
part
the
bulk
of
the
change
be
compress
within
a
few
month
of
the
year
our
assignment
for
that
year
state
briefly
be
to
transform
the
world
s
large
automobile
company
into
the
world
s
large
manufacturer
of
material
for
war
the
dimension
of
this
task
become
clear
immediately
after
pearl
harbor
in
the
one
month
of
january
we
receive
order
for
some
billion
of
military
good
a
figure
which
approximately
equal
the
total
of
all
the
order
we
have
get
during
the
entire
defense
program
until
then
during
the
rest
of
the
government
place
billion
more
of
military
order
with
general
motor
thus
by
the
end
of
that
year
we
have
receive
military
order
total
more
than
billion
an
immense
figure
even
for
a
corporation
like
general
motor
whose
record
prewar
total
output
achieve
in
be
billion
in
other
word
we
have
not
only
to
alter
the
character
of
our
product
but
to
increase
our
total
output
substantially
fortunately
we
have
do
some
advance
planning
which
enable
us
to
take
on
this
vast
problem
systematically
in
june
our
policy
committee
of
which
i
be
chairman
have
begin
to
study
the
problem
that
would
arise
in
general
motor
if
the
corporation
be
convert
to
war
production
on
a
large
scale
and
in
the
ensue
month
the
committee
make
some
basic
policy
decision
one
of
these
decision
concerned
the
size
of
our
wartime
operation
we
conclude
that
since
general
motor
then
have
about
percent
of
the
nation
s
facility
for
manufacturing
metal
product
the
corporation
should
endeavor
to
produce
about
this
proportion
of
the
nation
s
armament
in
wartime
in
retrospect
it
be
hard
to
say
whether
we
ever
do
achieve
this
goal
altogether
the
united
state
government
spent
some
billion
on
military
hardware
during
world
war
ii
general
motor
sale
of
war
material
come
to
billion
which
would
represent
only
percent
of
the
total
however
i
believe
that
our
cost
be
low
than
those
of
the
average
war
contractor
for
similar
product
another
basic
decision
reach
by
the
policy
committee
concerned
our
form
of
organization
during
wartime
three
member
of
the
policy
committee
mr
wilson
president
of
the
corporation
and
mr
bradley
and
mr
hunt
executive
vice
president
be
make
a
triumvirate
to
handle
all
operation
policy
then
in
we
formally
set
up
the
war
administration
committee
to
take
charge
of
all
war
operation
for
the
duration
the
committee
have
twelve
member
later
increase
to
fourteen
include
the
triumvirate
who
remain
as
its
senior
operating
member
at
the
same
time
we
conclude
that
our
basic
organizational
policy
the
policy
of
decentralize
responsibility
with
coordinate
control
should
stand
in
war
as
in
peace
for
flexibility
be
as
important
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
this
decision
meant
that
in
war
the
primary
responsibility
for
contract
pricing
and
production
rest
with
each
individual
division
of
the
corporation
subject
of
course
to
our
overall
policy
the
decision
also
meant
that
our
system
of
corporate
integration
under
which
the
various
division
subcontract
work
to
one
another
should
be
preserve
this
system
of
internal
subcontract
work
very
effectively
under
wartime
condition
even
though
it
require
a
great
effort
of
coordination
for
example
the
m
tank
which
cadillac
begin
to
produce
in
have
part
supply
by
seventeen
other
division
we
also
decide
that
we
would
continue
to
rely
heavily
on
outside
subcontractor
we
have
business
relation
with
some
peacetime
supplier
during
the
war
this
figure
grow
steadily
and
at
the
peak
of
our
wartime
production
in
we
be
use
the
facility
of
some
subcontractor
another
policy
decision
design
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
our
production
effort
still
far
call
for
the
transfer
of
plant
and
equipment
within
the
corporation
and
to
some
extent
outside
it
during
the
war
year
almost
machine
belonging
to
general
motor
and
almost
belonging
to
the
government
be
transfer
from
one
division
to
another
we
lease
several
of
our
plant
to
other
corporation
that
be
able
to
make
well
use
of
them
and
we
in
turn
acquire
the
use
of
many
other
plant
for
vary
period
at
the
begin
of
eighteen
of
the
plant
we
be
operating
in
the
united
state
be
lease
from
the
government
and
another
six
be
lease
from
others
i
should
mention
one
other
very
important
decision
reach
in
we
decide
that
general
motor
should
seek
to
perform
the
most
complicate
and
difficult
production
assignment
as
i
have
already
indicate
most
of
the
military
product
we
make
be
entirely
new

the

one

the
military
science

then
advance
so

that
we

redesign
much
of
the

we
produce
toward
the

another
of
our

the
continuous
change
in
our
product
mix
all
during
the

the

during

we
have
to
hire
and
train
in
the
united
state
a
stagger
number
of
new

in

in
during

more

the
sheer
number
involve
be
distress
enough
but
in
addition
the
worker
we
get
be
generally
at
a
very
low
level
of
industrial
skill
many
of
them
be
not
physically
fit
many
especially
the
woman
have
no
prior

experience
at

from
about

to
about
percent
of
total
hourly
employee
to
work
with
this
volatile
and
largely
unskilled
labor
force
we
be
oblige
to
rationalize
our
production
technique
as
much
as
possible
for
example
when
the
m
tank
go
into
production
at
cadillac
the
division
developed
a
merry
go
round
type
of
conveyer
which
make
it
possible
for
each
of
the
welder
to
perform
one
specialized
relatively
simple
task
instead
of
a
difficult
series
of
weld
operation
by
skilled
manpower
be
in
such
short
supply
that
its
availability
at
a
particular
plant
often
become
a
control
reason
for
perform
certain
job
there
even
when
other
plant
have
superior
machinery
for
the
job
the
basic
financial
policy
which
underlay
our
operation
during
the
war
have
much
to
do
with
our
performance
early
in
the
policy
committee
of
the
corporation
adopt
a
new
policy
on
wartime
price
and
profit
as
we
described
this
policy
to
the
war
department
s
price
adjustment
board
it
be
design
to
limit
the
overall
rate
of
profit
from
manufacturing
operation
before
provision
for
income
and
excess
profit
tax
but
after
all
other
charge
include
reserve
provision
to
or
approximately
one
half
the
profit
margin
express
as
a
percentage
of
sale
secure
in
the
year
largely
under
the
condition
of
a
competitive
market
in
other
word
we
voluntarily
halve
our
pre
tax
profit
margin
even
though
it
be
clear
that
tax
would
be
substantially
high
than
they
have
be
in
related
to
this
policy
of
profit
limitation
be
another
policy
of
take
war
production
contract
on
a
fix
price
basis
wherever
possible
we
prefer
the
fix
price
contract
because
of
the
great
incentive
which
it
provide
for
efficient
operation
as
compare
with
the
cost
plus
fix
fee
type
of
contract
we
realize
of
course
that
in
undertaking
the
production
of
many
war
material
which
be
new
to
us
which
have
not
in
fact
be
manufacture
by
anyone
on
a
mass
production
basis
there
be
always
a
possibility
that
our
cost
estimate
might
turn
out
to
be
high
than
actual
cost
we
therefore
stipulate
to
the
war
department
s
price
adjustment
board
that
we
would
reduce
price
as
we
get
the
cost
down
as
we
foresaw
our
cost
do
go
down
significantly
on
most
contract
after
we
have
some
production
experience
and
achieve
high
volume
the
example
below
which
show
the
pricing

of
frigidaire

suggests
the
close
relationship
between
high
volume
and
low

price
early
in
due
to
a
decrease
in

i
know
of
to
think
seriously
about
our
place
in
the
postwar
world
and
to
develop
specific
and
comprehensive
program
for
action
indeed
i
deliver
an
address
on
industry
s
post
war
responsibility
to
the
national
association
of
manufacturer
on
december
three
day
before
pearl
harbor
as
the
war
year
go
by
and
it
become
possible
to
discern
some
of
the
outline
of
the
postwar
world
we
face
the
necessity
of
planning
for
commercial
production
again
specifically
we
have
to
decide
whether
to
figure
on
an
expand
economy
or
to
pull
in
our
horn
for
the
postwar
depression
which
many
economist
and
businessmen
take
for
grant
i
be
proud
to
say
that
we
plan
for
expansion
indeed
i
think
it
be
fair
to
state
that
our
plan
which
i
announce
in
a
speech
to
the
n
a
m
in
december
be
themselves
a
force
for
an
expand
economy
a
positive
inducement
to
other
businessmen
to
plan
for
growth
i
quote
from
the
speech
in
order
to
show
some
of
our
specific
calculation
here
be
the
general
motor
approach
we
start
with
the
conviction
that
the
prewar
standard
of
national
income
pass
with
the
prewar
period
itself
our
increase
productive
capacity
as
a
nation
our
broader
distribution
of
know
how
our
improve
technique
the
acceleration
of
our
technical
knowledge
result
from
the
stimulation
of
the
war
all
justify
a
reasonable
demand
on
the
part
of
our
people
for
an
advanced
order
of
thing
our
enormous
public
debt
and
the
constantly
increase
cost
of
government
legitimate
and
otherwise
demand
a
great
volume
of
production
and
a
high
national
income
base
otherwise
the
burden
of
government
on
enterprise
and
on
the
individual
will
seriously
prejudice
the
possibility
of
an
expand
economy
let
us
assume
as
a
prewar
base
a
national
income
of
to
billion
dollar
under
the
postwar
circumstance
a
new
base
of
billion
of
the
same
dollar
should
be
a
reasonable
objective
we
then
determine
the
potential
volume
of
each
of
our
product
or
service
both
old
and
new
on
the
basis
of
the
expand
production
opportunity
recognize
that
each
item
of
necessity
have
a
different
elasticity
of
demand
the
result
be
a
measure
of
the
new
operating
base
and
determines
the
need
economic
resource
of
production
such
as
manpower
organization
plant
and
machinery
in
term
of
such
a
projection
in
general
motor
include
the
cost
of
reconversion
the
advancement
of
present
equipment
to
the
late
standard
of
technology
and
retool
for
postwar
product
there
will
be
involve
an
aggregate
expenditure
of
approximately
that
be
the
contribution
we
be
prepared
to
make
to
help
preserve
the
free
competitive
enterprise
system
as
the
keystone
of
the
american
economy
i
might
note
that
the
national
income
forecast
in
this
passage
which
be
consider
wildly
optimistic
when
i
make
them
actually
prove
to
be
conservative
in
our
national
income
measure
in
dollar
be
around
billion
not
billion
since
then
the
figure
have
increase
to
about
billion
in
dollar
immediately
after
v
j
day
we
receive
of
course
an
avalanche
of
contract
termination
amount
to
approximately
billion
of
war
order
the
suddenness
with
which
the
war
end
make
an
orderly
transition
to
peacetime
operation
impossible
and
ensure
that
we
would
be
snow
under
by
paper
work
the
bulk
of
it
connect
with
termination
claim
for
many
month
we
be
also
confront
suddenly
with
the
vast
job
of
physical
reconstruction
that
have
to
be
do
on
general
motor
plant
throughout
the
country
i
be
inform
that
it
require
freight
car
load
to
haul
away
our
military
inventory
and
another
to
dispose
of
government
own
machinery
and
equipment
meanwhile
we
be
rush
to
equip
our
plant
for
commercial
production
altogether
there
be
a
mess
but
no
confusion
the
planning
which
have
be
do
and
the
cooperation
of
the
arm
service
cut
down
the
period
of
plant
clearance
and
reconversion
so
that
our
first
automobile
be
produce
and
ship
about
forty
five
day
after
v
j
day
in
general
motor
reconversion
after
world
war
ii
do
not
mean
simply
get
plant
back
into
the
shape
they
have
be
in
before
the
war
the
postwar
program
be
carefully
plan
for
expansion
and
improvement
it
include
the
organize
and
balance
of
exist
production
facility
new
machine
and
equipment
and
some
completely
new
plant
much
of
it
be
aim
at
improve
work
condition
for
our
employee
for
example
provide
new
cafeteria
and
well
medical
facility
the
result
be
a
production
plant
which
be
much
more
efficient
in
several
different
respect
the
korean
war
confront
us
with
another
complex
planning
problem
its
peculiarity
be
that
it
involve
partial
mobilization
the
military
effort
during
this
war
as
i
have
say
be
in
no
way
comparable
to
our
mobilization
during
world
war
ii
the
total
volume
involve
in
for
example
some
billion
of
defense
production
be
less
than
percent
of
the
volume
of
armament
we
have
produce
in
we
knew
soon
after
the
war
broke
out
that
we
would
be
expect
again
to
take
on
about
percent
of
the
nation
s
armament
manufacture
we
be
also
be
encourage
by
the
government
to
expand
our
facility
to
build
new
plant
that
could
be
convert
to
defense
production
if
the
armament
requirement
should
grow
we
want
to
accommodate
the
government
but
we
certainly
do
not
want
to
be
stuck
with
a
lot
of
excess
capacity
on
the
other
hand
we
do
not
want
to
be
short
of
capacity
in
the
future
it
gradually
become
clear
as
the
year
wore
on
that
some
serious
planning
about
expansion
be
call
for
on
november
i
address
a
memorandum
to
mr
bradley
then
chairman
of
the
financial
policy
committee
in
which
i
state
my
own
belief
that
the
long
term
economic
activity
of
the
country
will
continue
to
increase
in
the
future
as
it
have
in
the
past
stimulate
by
scientific
knowledge
and
technological
progress
related
thereto
and
an
expand
population
this
will
be
reflect
in
expand
demand
for
general
motor
product
that
the
economic
consequence
of
have
too
little
capacity
as
measure
by
loss
in
competitive
position
prestige
and
reduce
profit
be
entirely
out
of
relation
to
the
cost
of
carry
surplus
capacity
surplus
capacity
within
reason
be
always
temporary
as
judged
by
the
past
and
i
believe
the
future
for
my
purpose
here
i
be
define
demand
as
not
only
normal
demand
but
abnormal
demand
such
as
result
from
arbitrary
curtailment
of
production
provide
such
abnormality
be
reasonably
consequential
and
can
be
expect
to
continue
over
even
a
restrict
period
notwithstanding
our
ambitious
postwar
program
we
have
lose
position
by
not
have
sufficient
capacity
to
meet
our
sale
potentiality
hence
we
have
strengthen
competition
at
our
own
cost
it
do
not
appear
that
our
effective
capacity
as
a
percentage
of
that
of
the
industry
have
move
up
in
relation
to
the
gain
make
as
a
percentage
of
the
business
during
the
late
prewar
year
i
then
go
on
to
suggest
that
we
make
a
serious
effort
to
gauge
the
demand
over
the
next
five
to
ten
year
and
make
plan
to
meet
that
demand
in
building
new
facility
i
suggest
that
we
use
corporation
fund
for
such
new
plant
need
for
armament
if
that
give
us
well
control
over
same
from
the
long
term
position
in
relation
to
the
master
plan
accelerate
depreciation
make
the
use
of
corporate
fund
all
the
more
feasible
and
relieve
the
government
of
the
necessity
of
provide
capital
for
the
plant
our
market
forecast
suggest
that
expansion
be
indeed
call
for
in
february
and
march
we
decide
on
a
program
of
which
these
be
the
main
element
we
would
plan
in
the
circumstance
to
retain
about
percent
of
our
capacity
for
commercial
production
we
would
expand
our
capacity
in
the
united
state
and
canada
by
about
percent
from
car
and
truck
per
day
to
figure
on
a
day
work
year
which
would
include
some
overtime
day
this
would
enable
us
to
produce
car
and
truck
a
year
the
expansion
would
not
be
uniform
however
chevrolet
would
gain
percent
pontiac
percent
oldsmobile
percent
buick
percent
cadillac
percent
these
figure
be
of
course
modify
in
the
ensue
year
we
would
need
some
fifteen
to
twenty
million
additional
square
foot
of
plant
an
increase
of
percent
in
the
floor
space
use
for
car
and
truck
production
for
production
of
military
product
for
the
korean
war
cost
about
million
we
estimate
that
the
machinery
and
equipment
require
to
outfit
these
new
plant
for
commercial
production
after
the
emergency
would
cost
an
additional
million
in
short
the
new
program
be
even
more
ambitious
by
million
than
the
million
expansion
program
we
undertook
after
world
war
ii
we
have
no
cause
to
regret
this
second
great
expansion
it
serve
its
purpose
by
provide
facility
for
military
production
during
the
korean
war
and
for
civilian
production
afterward
indeed
our
new
facility
be
severely
strain
in
a
year
of
record
demand
when
we
sell
car
and
truck
of
united
state
and
canadian
origin
and
the
entire
industry
be
at
an
all
time
high
the
military
product
we
turn
out
during
the
korean
war
be
essentially
advanced
version
of
the
product
we
have
make
in
world
war
ii
tank
aircraft
truck
gun
and
so
forth
today
not
only
have
modern
defense
equipment
change
radically
but
the
main
activity
be
in
research
and
development
rather
than
in
production
this
have
have
a
considerable
bearing
on
the
role
of
general
motor
in
defense
we
do
research
and
development
in
our
field
of
competence
but
we
be
largely
a
production
organization
and
production
be
not
primarily
what
the
defense
establishment
need
at
this
time
this
account

the
fact
that
our

to
the
maximum
chapter
personnel
and
labor
relation
at
the
time
i
write
this
it
be
more
than
seventeen
year
since
there
have
be
an
extend
strike
over
national
issue
at
general
motor
to
those
of
us
who
recall
the
violent
and
crisis
ridden
atmosphere
of
the
mid
s
or
the
long
ordeal
of
the
great
postwar
strike
of
the
record
of
the
past
seventeen
year
seem
almost
incredible
and
we
have
achieve
this
record
without
surrender
any
of
the
basic
responsibility
of
management
it
be
often
argue
that
we
get
labor
peace
only
by
promote
a
contract
which
stimulates
inflation
this
be
a
matter
of
too
great
complexity
for
discussion
here
but
let
me
say
i
do
not
believe
it
before
take
up
our
relation
with
labor
organization
i
think
it
be
appropriate
to
remind
the
reader
that
many
of
our
personnel
policy
exist
independently
of
collective
bargaining

at
the
begin
of

about

very
few
of
the

be
represent

in

our

receive

number
of

which
be
not
mention
in

and
which
in
some
case
be
be
provide
by

before

all

instead
they

training

example
be
one
of
which
we
be

proud
we
have
always
take
great
pain
to
keep
foreman
s
morale
at
the
high
level
in
foreman
be
place
on
a
salary
basis
and
in
we
adopt
the
rule
that
their
salary
have
to
be
at
least
percent
high
than
the
earnings
of
the
high
paid
group
of

under

our
foreman
who
constitute
our
first
line
of
supervision
have
be
get
overtime
allowance
since
the
early
day
of
world
war
ii
though
the
federal
wage
and
hour
law
do
not
require
the
payment
of
overtime
to
supervisor
but
perhaps
the
most
important
reason
for
the
high
morale
of
our
foreman
be
the
solid
support
we
have
give
them
on
matter
of
discipline
and
work
standard
they
know
that
they
be
consider
member
of
management
as
the
forego
fact
indicate
our
personnel
staff
have
a
great
many
responsibility
besides
its
well
publicize
negotiation
with
the

although
personnel
administration
first
become
a
regular
responsibility
at
the
corporation
staff
level
in
all
our
personnel
program
be
not
centralize
in
one
department
until
since
then
the
personnel
staff
have
serve
the
corporation
in
two
way
as
a
specialized
staff
of
expert
on
which
the
corporation
can
rely
for
advice
and
consultation
and
as
a
group
of
executive
entrust
with
line

negotiation
and
in
administer
the
provision
of

the

do
not
by
the
way
ordinarily
get
into
the

of

grievance
under
our
four
step

it

so

the

handle
for

most
part
by

of

the
fourth

for
resolution
by
an
impartial
umpire
the
responsibility
of
the
personnel
staff
be
obviously
very
grave
one
especially
as
they
relate
to
our
dealing
with
union
for
in
these
dealing
there
be
always
the
possibility
of
great
damage
to
the
corporation
and
of
severe
suffer
to
its
employee
on
the
one
hand
we
must
wherever
possible
avoid
big
strike
and
small
one
too
on
the
other
hand
we
must
not
succumb
to
unreasonable
economic
demand
or
surrender
the
basic
responsibility
of
management
avoid
both
of
these
hazard
be
no
easy
task
and
yet
we
have
in
the
past
decade
and
a
half
be
reasonably
successful
at
do
so
in
the
early
postwar
period
our
prospect
for
workable
labor
relation
appear
to
be
remote
at
the
end
of
the
strike
the
united
automobile
worker
be
one
of
the
two
or
three
large
union
in
the
country
with
a
membership
of
almost
a
million
many
of
its
spokesman
be
hostile
to
private
enterprise
the
uaw
be
besiege
by
factional
conflict
both
internally
and
with
respect
to
other
union
the
principal
result
of
these
conflict
as
it
appear
to
us
be
a
tendency
for
every
side
to
compete
with
the
others
in
a
show
of
militance
against
the
corporation
to
make
matter
bad
it
appear
that
the
uaw
be
able
to
enlist
the
support
of
the
government
in
any
great
crisis
the
government
s
attitude
go
back
as
far
as
the
sit
down
strike
when
we
take
the
view
that
we
would
not
negotiate
with
the
union
while
its
agent
forcibly
held
possession
of
our
property
sit
down
strike
be
plainly
illegal
a
judgment
later
confirm
by
the
supreme
court
yet
president
franklin
d
roosevelt
secretary
of
labor
france
perkins
and
governor
frank
murphy
of
michigan
exert
steady
pressure
upon
the
corporation
and
upon
me
personally
to
negotiate
with
the
striker
who
have
seize
our
property
until
finally
we
felt
oblige
to
do
so
again
in
during
the
day
strike
president
truman
formally
back
up
the
union
s
controversial
insistence
that
our
ability
to
pay
should
affect
the
size
of
the
wage
increase
we
successfully
resist
this
unsound
proposition
but
there
be
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
president
s
statement
serve
to
strengthen
the
union
s
public
position
and
thus
prolong
the
strike
there
be
one
other
reason
for
concern
about
our
labor
prospect
in
the
early
postwar
period
and
that
be
the
sharp
inflation
then
under
way
in
price
control
be
take
off
and
in
nine
month
consumer
price
rise
by
percent
in
they
rise
almost
percent
high
the
natural
inclination
of
union
in
an
inflationary
period
be
to
bargain
for
wage
increase
high
enough
to
allow
for
future
price
increase
and
in
anticipate
these
high
price
the
wage
gain
tend
to
push
them
up
still
high
the
annual
round
of
wage
and
price
increase
after
the
war
be
a
perfect
example
of
this
inflationary
spiral
since
the
united
automobile
worker
regard
itself
perhaps
accurately
as
a
pace
setter
for
labor
general
motor
face
the
possibility
that
when
it
grant
demand
it
would
be
a
conspicuous
target
in
each
new
round
of
inflationary
demand
our
apprehension
about
our
postwar
labor
relation
be
not
diminish
by
the
fact
that
we
get
through
without
a
major
strike
during
that
year
s
negotiation
in
fact
something
happen
that
point
up
the
problem
we
face
in
mid
april
while
we
be
still
in
negotiation
we
begin
to
hear
report
that
the
uaw
plan
to
pull
all
its
member
in
the
detroit
area
off
their
job
so
that
they
could
attend
a
union
sponsor
demonstration
against
the
taft
hartley
bill
then
be
consider
in
congress
the
demonstration
which
be
to
be
held
in
downtown
detroit
be
the
union
s
own
business
of
course
but
the
work
stoppage
be
very
much
our
concern
we
point
out
to
the
union
s
negotiator
on
three
occasion
that
stop
work
to
attend
the
rally
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
strike
and
stoppage
section
of
our
contract
and
that
employee
who
walk
out
would
be
subject
to
discipline
after
the
sit
down
strike
we
have
insist
that
future
contract
provide
for
penalty
for
work
stoppage
prohibit
during
the
term
of
the
contract
in
reply
the
union
men
blandly
told
us
that
the
walkout
have
be
authorize
by
the
international
executive
board
but
that
our
view
of
the
case
would
be
conveyed
to
the
board
at
p
m
on
the
th
of
april
the
very
day
a
new
contract
be
sign
the
walkout
begin
it
be
only
partially
successful
since
hourly
rat
employee
in
seven
of
the
corporation
s
detroit
plant
do
not
go
out
but
do
and
in
the
course
of
the
walkout
they
commit
numerous
act
of
intimidation
or
near
violence
it
seem
to
us
that
this
be
a
reversion
by
the
uaw
to
its
earlier
day
inclination
to
violate
the
contract
at
will
accordingly
we
respond
firmly
as
we
have
in
the
past
we
discharge
fifteen
employee
and
give
long
term
disciplinary
layoff
to
twenty
five
others
for
extraordinary
overt
action
these
forty
employee
include
four
president
of
local
union
six
chairman
of
shop
committee
and
twenty
two
shop
and
district
committeeman
in
addition
employee
be
give
short
term
disciplinary
lay
offs
the
union
have
of
course
the
right
to
appeal
all
these
action
to
the
permanent
umpire
however
it
chose
to
negotiate
with
the
corporation
and
finally
do
concede
that
it
have
violate
the
agreement
a
formal
memorandum
of
understand
sign
on
may
include
an
explicit
statement
by
the
union
that
all
such
work
stoppage
be
violation
in
return
the
corporation
reduce
the
fifteen
discharge
to
long
term
layoff
and
in
other
way
modify
the
original
penalty
during
the
year
that
follow
our
labor
relation
be
dramatically
change
for
the
well
that
year
saw
the
defeat
and
discredit
of
the
communist
element
in
the
united
automobile
worker
and
the
begin
then
of
somewhat
great
stability
in
the
union
s
internal
affair
the
major
instrument
of
change
in
our
labor
relation
be
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
principal
new
feature
of
which
have
be
retain
in
subsequent
agreement
since
these
feature
have
prove
so
important
in
the
affair
of
general
motor
i
shall
devote
most
of
the
remainder
of
this
chapter
to
a
discussion
of
them
and
of
their
background
the
agreement
brought
two
major
innovation
to
our
dealing
with
our
hourly
rat
employee
for
one
thing
it
eliminate
annual
economic
negotiation
with
the
union
and
introduce
the
idea
of
longer
term
contract
the
agreement
ran
for
two
year
it
be
follow
in
by
a
five
year
contract
and
then
by
three
successive
three
year
contract
these
longer
interval
give
the
corporation
more
assurance
that
it
could
meet
its
long
range
production
schedule
and
they
also
meant
an
important
save
to
us
in
executive
man
hour
for
labor
negotiation
have
invariably
consume
a
great
deal
of
the
time
of
the
high
official
of
the
corporation
the
longer
term
contract
also
relieve
our
employee
of
their
annual
concern
over
the
prospect
of
a
strike
and
enable
them
to
plan
their
own
affair
with
great
confidence
the
other
innovation
of
the
contract
be
the
so
call
general
motor
wage
formula
this
formula
have
two
feature
an
escalator
clause
which
provide
for
wage
allowance
to
employee
base
on
change
in
the
cost
of
living
and
an
annual
improvement
factor
which
assure
employee
of
a
regular
share
in
the
benefit
of
increase
efficiency
result
from
advance
technology
the
entire
formula
represent
an
effort
to
introduce
an
element
of
reason
and
of
predictability
into
our
wage
program
especially
it
aim
to
end
at
least
in
part
the
contest
of
strength
in
which
our
wage
have
often
be
set
in
the
past
our
search
for
a
rational
wage
program
of
this
sort
really
begin
in
the
s
in
specifically
we
become
interested
in
the
possibility
of
tie
wage
to
change
in
the
cost
of
living
initially
we
thought
in
term
of
the
local
cost
of
living
index
prepared
by
the
bureau
of
labor
statistic
rather
than
of
the
bureau
s
national
index
in
the
bureau
publish
semiannual
report
on
change
in
living
cost
in
thirty
two
city
in
twelve
of
these
city
include
detroit
general
motor
have
plant
however
there
be
many
other
city
with
general
motor
plant
which
the
bureau
do
not
report
on
this
practical
difficulty
be
one
reason
we
do
not
pursue
the
subject
at
the
time
another
reason
be
the
relative
stability
of
consumer
price
in
and
indeed
in
the
year
through
price
fluctuation
be
no
real
issue
in
our
wage
adjustment
during
those
year
but
during
the
defense
program
stimulate
a
sharp
increase
in
price
and
the
problem
of
inflation
confront
us
and
our
employee
in
an
inescapable
fashion
on
april
accordingly
i
write
to
virgil
jordan
the
president
of
the
national
industrial
conference
board
and
ask
him
what
he
thought
about
the
possibility
of
a
wage
formula
tie
to
a
cost
of
living
index
do
you
think
there
would
be
any
sense
to
an
approach
to
establish
an
economic
formula
for
wage
adjustment
if
we
base
it
upon
the
assumption
that
real
wage
be
bound
to
increase
in
the
future
just
as
they
have
in
the
last
twenty
five
year
and
that
we
recognize
that
fact
in
such
a
formula
by
increase
the
dollar
wage
rate
as
the
cost
of
living
increase
preferably
on
a
community
basis
in
some
ratio
that
might
be
work
out
which
would
cover
the
objective
but
in
the
event
that
the
cost
of
living
should
decline
the
decrease
in
the
dollar
wage
rate
would
be
at
a
low
percentage
rate
than
the
increase
this
would
insure
over
the
year
an
increase
in
real
wage
to
which
i
believe
the
worker
be
entitle
and
which
industry
be
obligate
to
make
possible
through
capitalization
of
increase
technological
efficiency
this
informal
suggestion
elicit
a
generally
pessimistic
reaction
from
mr
jordan
he
reply
that
he
be
doubtful
about
our
chance
of
get
union
to
go
along
with
an
automatic
wage
formula
union
leader
he
suggest
would
prefer
to
play
an
active
role
in
set
wage
nevertheless
the
exchange
of
letter
serve
to
stimulate
our
interest
in
the
broad
principle
of
tie
wage
to
living
cost
early
in
charles
e
wilson
then
president
of
general
motor
advanced
our
think
on
this
subject
far
he
be
confine
to
the
hospital
with
a
broken
hip
and
give
a
good
deal
of
his
time
there
to
the
study
of
a
wage
formula
he
come
out
with
two
new
point
regard
wage
adjustment
one
be
that
as
a
practical
matter
wage
adjustment
base
on
change
in
the
cost
of
living
must
be
tie
to
the
national
consumer
price
index
otherwise
the
corporation
would
continually
be
in
the
position
of
give
increase
to
some
of
its
employee
and
not
to
others
which
would
be
logical
enough
as
far
as
the
economics
of
the
case
go
but
which
might
create
real
psychological
problem
the
other
point
put
forward
by
mr
wilson
concerned
the
mean
of
afford
our
worker
a
share
in
rise
productivity
it
be
his
contention
that
the
only
feasible
way
to
do
this
be
to
set
a
fix
increase
which
each
worker
would
receive
annually
this
proposal
be
the
origin
of
the
annual
improvement
factor
in
the
general
motor
formula
though
the
basic
element
of
the
wage
formula
be
work
out
by
mr
wilson
in
there
be
no
good
opportunity
to
introduce
the
formula
in
collective
bargaining
until
the
negotiation
during
the
wartime
year
the
government
s
wage
stabilization
policy
make
it
difficult
to
initiate
any
new
proposal
in
it
be
apparent
that
our
employee
would
be
interested
only
in
a
very
large
increase
in
basic
wage
to
enable
them
to
catch
up
with
the
wartime
rise
in
living
cost
furthermore
the
union
s
insistence
during
the
long
strike
of
that
wage
increase
be
determine
by
our
ability
to
pay
and
that
we
should
in
effect
negotiate
our
sell
price
raise
a
crucial
issue
of
principle
which
we
felt
have
to
be
settle
before
any
new
wage
program
could
be
adopt
again
in
we
felt
that
our
employee
principal
need
be
a
sizable
increase
in
basic
wage
the
negotiation
begin
on
march
and
appear
at
the
outset
to
follow
the
pattern
of
the
precede
year
the
union
demand
be
if
anything
more
extreme
than
ever
they
amount
in
fact
to
a
proposal
to
rewrite
virtually
the
whole
basic
contract
developed
painfully
during
the
precede
decade
the
demand
also
include
a
wage
increase
of
twenty
five
cent
an
hour
a
pension
program
a
social
security
program
a
guaranteed
forty
hour
work
week
and
many
other
economic
item
we
regard
these
demand
as
extravagant
beyond
reason
and
fear
that
if
the
uaw
persist
in
them
we
would
have
another
disastrous
strike
similar
to
the
one
indeed
it
seem
in
the
spring
of
as
though
the
nation
might
be
in
for
one
of
the
most
severe
year
of
strike
it
have
ever
face
most
of
the
steel
and
electrical
industry
negotiation
be
deadlocked
on
may
the
uaw
struck
chrysler
and
at
about
that
time
begin
to
conduct
strike
vote
among
their
general
motor
local
there
be
however
one
circumstance
favor
us
in
the
negotiation
this
be
that
we
have
reach
an
agreement
with
the
uaw
that
negotiation
would
be
conduct
in
relative
privacy
in
previous
year
our
collective
bargaining
have
come
to
resemble
a
public
political
forum
in
which
the
union
fed
a
stream
of
provocative
statement
to
the
press
and
we
felt
oblige
to
answer
publicly
the
privacy
of
the
negotiation
make
their
tone
more
realistic
from
the
start
nevertheless
the
negotiation
go
slowly
and
in
may
a
strike
seem
imminent
at
this
point
we
decide
to
introduce
our
wage
formula
into
the
bargaining
on
may
we
hand
it
to
the
uaw
in
write
form
we
have
no
indication
in
advance
that
the
union
would
respond
affirmatively
to
our
contract
proposal
however
the
union
accepted
it
in
principle
and
we
begin
to
work
on
the
detail
to
speed
up
bargaining
we
suggest
that
general
motor
and
the
union
appoint
four
man
task
force
to
study
the
question
the
detail
of
the
new
formula
be
work
out
in
three
day
of
almost
continuous
bargaining
the
contract
be
as
i
have
say
for
two
year
its
novelty
make
the
union
unwilling
to
commit
itself
for
a
longer
period
the
annual
improvement
factor
be
set
at
three
cent
an
hour
for
every
worker
cover
by
the
contract
and
the
base
date
finally
agree
upon
for
use
in
calculate
the
cost
of
living
formula
be
the
last
year
in
which
price
have
be
fairly
stable
there
be
several
point
about
the
general
motor
formula
that
need
to
be
understood
first
as
to
the
annual
improvement
factor
which
be
often
misinterpret
even
by
person
familiar
with
labor
question
section
a
of
the
contract
which
deal
with
the
improvement
factor
state
that
a
continue
improvement
in
the
standard
of
living
of
employee
depends
upon
technological
progress
well
tool
method
process
and
equipment
and
a
cooperative
attitude
on
the
part
of
all
party
in
such
progress
to
produce
more
with
the
same
amount
of
human
effort
be
a
sound
economic
and
social
objective
in
other
word
the
real
source
of
income
be
productivity
the
union
s
acceptance
of
these
sensible
word
be
surely
a
milestone
in
labor
relation
but
contrary
to
a
widespread
assumption
the
improvement
factor
be
not
link
to
a
definitely
know
increase
in
productivity
at
general
motor
there
be
to
my
knowledge
no
satisfactory
technique
with
which
to
measure
productivity
at
general
motor
or
in
fact
at
any
corporation
which
manufacture
constantly
change
product
and
even
if
an
industrial
productivity
measurement
could
somehow
be
provide
it
would
still
not
be
desirable
to
relate
it
in
direct
proportion
to
wage
increase
such
a
policy
apply
to
the
economy
as
a
whole
would
bring
about
intolerable
discrepancy
between
the
wage
paid
in
industry
where
technological
progress
be
rapidly
increase
and
the
wage
paid
where
technological
progress
must
be
limited
as
it
be
in
the
so
call
service
industry
it
be
my
belief
that
the
improvement
factor
should
reflect
the
long
term
productivity
increase
of
the
u
s
economy
as
a
whole
over
the
year
it
have
be
estimate
productivity
in
the
united
state
have
be
rise
about
percent
a
year
how
good
that
estimate
be
i
do
not
know
in
any
case
we
set
the
improvement
factor
in
the
general
motor
formula
at
three
cent
an
hour
this
amount
to
a
percent
annual
increase
in
wage
rate
three
cent
be
percent
of
which
be
then
the
average
hourly
rate
at
general
motor
in
subsequent
negotiation
the
improvement
factor
have
be
increase
several
time
note
that
the
corporation
commits
itself
to
deliver
this
increase
over
the
period
of
the
contract
no
matter
what
actually
happens
to
the
productivity
of
u
s
industry
even
if
productivity
should
decline
for
the
country
as
a
whole
or
for
general
motor
in
particular
we
would
still
be
oblige
to
pay
the
annual
improvement
factor
i
have
always
felt
that
it
be
a
source
of
confusion
to
label
the
improvement
factor
a
productivity
increase
i
prefer
to
think
of
it
as
a
group
merit
raise
of
sort
and
i
suspect
that
many
general
motor
employee
see
it
in
that
light
in
the
end
increase
efficiency
flow
not
so
much
from
the
increase
effectiveness
of
the
worker
but
primarily
from
more
efficient
management
and
from
the
investment
of
additional
capital
in
labor
save
device
some
union
spokesman
talk
as
though
the
entire
benefit
of
increase
productivity
should
go
to
labor
i
do
not
believe
that
be
sound
new
machinery
cost
money
and
the
additional
investment
must
be
justified
by
a
return
on
that
investment
an
argument
could
be
make
that
the
consumer
and
the
economy
as
a
whole
would
benefit
most
if
productivity
increase
be
apply
entirely
to
the
lower
of
price
ideally
that
might
be
a
good
thing
but
since
it
be
in
the
nature
of
people
to
work
well
with
the
incentive
of
an
individual
or
group
gain
and
to
want
to
bargain
over
it
it
be
a
good
thing
to
have
something
to
bargain
over
and
so
i
conclude
that
the
benefit
of
productivity
increase
should
be
apportion
among
the
consumer
low
price
or
well
product
labor
high
wage
and
the
shareholder
return
on
investment
the
improvement
factor
as
it
be
first
apply
in
the
general
motor
formula
have
one
curious
effect
under
the
and
agreement
the
improvement
come
to
exactly
the
same
rate
per
hour
for
all
worker
floor
sweeper
and
highly
skilled
tool
and
die
maker
alike
the
decision
to
take
the
average
worker
and
pay
percent
of
his
rate
that
be
three
cent
an
hour
to
all
our
men
be
clearly
a
move
in
the
direction
of
equalitarianism
the
effect
of
course
be
that
the
improvement
factor
give
the
tool
and
die
maker
do
not
come
to
as
much
as
percent
a
year
while
the
sweeper
be
get
an
increase
of
perhaps
percent
thus
from
to
the
improvement
factor
have
a
tendency
to
narrow
percentage
wage
differential
this
tendency
be
correct
in
the
contract
which
put
the
improvement
factor
on
a
basis
of
percent
with
a
minimum
of
six
cent
for
all
worker
while
the
improvement
factor
be
change
the
escalator
formula
remain
substantially
unchanged
even
though
it
too
have
tend
to
equalize
rate
of
pay
over
the
year
here
again
there
be
no
theoretical
reason
why
the
formula
could
not
have
provide
simply
for
a
percent
increase
in
pay
every
time
the
cost
of
living
rise
by
percent
instead
the
formula
be
set
so
that
every
worker
would
get
the
same
amount
of
money
add
to
his
pay
when
living
cost
rise
the
cost
of
living
program
be
calculate
in
this
manner
first
it
be
determine
that
consumer
price
have
go
up
about
percent
since
the
base
date
the
hourly
rate
of
the
average
general
motor
worker
have
go
up
only
about
percent
in
that
interval
to
make
up
the
percent
difference
eight
cent
an
hour
be
add
to
the
rate
but
this
increase
obviously
amount
to
more
than
percent
for
low
paid
worker
and
less
than
that
for
high
paid
worker
in
its
provision
for
future
increase
the
escalator
clause
have
a
similarly
equalize
effect
we
take
the
average
hourly
wage
and
the
april
consumer
price
index
the
late
available
at
that
time
and
determine
to
preserve
the
relationship
between
them
divide
the
average
wage
of
into
the
index
figure
of
we
come
up
with
a
one
cent
increase
for
each
upward
movement
of
point
in
the
price
index
accordingly
this
become
the
rule
for
all
our
worker
but
note
again
that
our
high
paid
worker
really
need
more
rapid
increase
to
keep
up
with
the
cost
of
living
while
a
janitor
make
an
hour
in
would
clearly
be
more
than
compensate
for
any
inflation
in
think
about
the
cost
of
living
part
of
the
general
motor
wage
formula
it
be
important
to
remember
that
it
be
the
average
wage
rate
that
be
really
tie
to
the
price
index
and
that
the
escalator
clause
tends
to
pull
all
other
wage
rate
toward
the
average
whether
this
equalitarian
effect
be
something
good
or
bad
in
the
long
run
i
be
not
prepared
to
say
i
think
it
be
interest
to
observe
that
the
many
wage
formula
adopt
by
other
union
in
imitation
of
our
own
program
almost
invariably
tend
to
preserve
this
equalize
feature
on
several
occasion
we
have
grant
skilled
trade
employee
special
increase
these
increase
have
offset
the
equalitarian
effect
of
the
formula
as
far
as
the
skilled
men
be
concerned
altogether
special
increase
for
tool
and
die
men
for
the
period
through
have
amount
to
thirty
one
cent
an
hour
in
other
way
too
the
original
concept
underlie
the
wage
formula
have
be
deflect
somewhat
by
the
exigency
of
collective
bargaining
one
recurrent
problem
have
be
the
floor
under
wage
in
our
cost
of
living
agreement
as
i
have
suggest
in
my
original
letter
to
mr
jordan
worker
would
want
some
limit
on
wage
reduction
even
in
a
period
of
severe
deflation
in
the
agreement
we
specify
that
no
matter
how
much
the
cost
of
living
might
fall
no
more
than
five
cent
of
the
original
eight
cent
cost
of
living
raise
could
be
take
away
again
in
and
the
floor
be
raise
by
an
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
corporation
the
logic
of
escalator
clause
apparently
cannot
be
extend
to
period
of
severe
deflation
because
worker
be
always
reluctant
to
take
wage
cut
the
negotiation
incidentally
present
an
interest
example
of
the
kind
of
public
pressure
which
have
be
steadily
exert
on
the
general
motor
wage
formula
and
which
have
make
it
difficult
for
the
formula
to
operate
as
mr
wilson
originally
intend
in
principle
there
should
not
have
be
any
negotiation
because
in
the
five
year
contract
sign
in
the
union
unqualifiedly
waive
d
the
right
to
bargain
on
any
issue
cover
in
the
contract
but
toward
the
end
of
the
uaw
become
dissatisfied
with
the
cost
of
living
provision
of
the
contract
the
union
fear
as
many
others
do
at
the
time
that
the
post
korea
inflation
have
about
run
its
course
if
the
cost
of
living
decline
its
member
would
lose
some
conceivably
all
of
the
special
allowance
which
they
be
then
receive
under
the
escalator
clause
to
make
matter
bad
the
wage
stabilization
board
have
allow
other
group
of
worker
that
be
in
the
steel
electrical
and
other
industry
to
receive
living
cost
increase
which
be
add
to
their
base
rate
in
other
word
a
deflation
would
mean
that
uaw
member
would
lose
some
take
home
pay
while
other
union
member
would
not
we
agree
with
the
union
that
wage
at
general
motor
should
not
lag
behind
those
in
comparable
industry
and
so
we
reopen
the
contract
and
incorporate
nineteen
cent
of
the
cost
of
living
allowance
which
be
then
up
to
twenty
four
cent
into
the
permanent
base
rate
this
episode
illustrates
the
difficulty
of
adhere
strictly
to
the
original
concept
of
the
wage
formula
our
wage
formula
have
often
be
attack
as
inflationary
i
would
agree
with
mr
wilson
that
the
formula
itself
do
no
more
than
protect
our
employee
against
inflation
however
the
formula
be
by
no
mean
our
whole
labor
contract
because
we
have
grant
many
fringe
benefit
some
critic
maintain
that
the
cost
increase
be
in
excess
of
productivity
and
that
therefore
the
formula
plus
the
fringe
benefit
may
have
inflationary
implication
there
be
another
factor
of
importance
that
must
be
consider
in
discuss
the
improvement
factor
i
have
say
that
in
my
opinion
it
be
more
of
an
incentive
or
a
bonus
than
it
be
an
improvement
factor
per
se
and
from
that
point
of
view
i
think
the
fact
that
our
worker
benefit
on
a
definite
and
prescribed
basis
result
in
an
increase
in
their
standard
of
living
give
us
a
more
sympathetic
cooperation
in
the
introduction
of
labor
save
device
and
other
improvement
that
flow
from
technological
progress
which
on
the
whole
have
a
healthy
influence
on
the
efficiency
of
the
corporation
s
operation
it
be
undeniable
as
of
this
write
that
the
formula
have
serve
to
bring
relative
peace
and
stability
to
our
labor
relation
we
have
have
no
extend
strike
over
negotiation
of
a
national
agreement
since
the
formula
go
into
effect
in
the
most
widely
publicize
addition
to
the
general
motor
labor
contract
in
the
last
few
year
have
be
the
provision
for
supplementary
unemployment
benefit
a
provision
often
though
not
accurately
described
as
the
guaranteed
annual
wage
as
all
the
major
automobile
company
approach
the
labor
negotiation
it
be
apparent
that
the
union
regard
this
program
as
a
great
milestone
in
its
history
and
intend
to
win
it
at
all
cost
a
large
part
of
the
idea
behind
this
program
that
be
the
idea
of
an
employer
finance
supplement
to
state
unemployment
compensation
have
already
be
work
out
by
the
union
apparently
in
and
however
the
plan
propose
by
the
ford
motor
company
and
finally
accepted
differ
in
many
respect
from
the
union
s
specific
proposal
and
be
much
more
conservatively
finance
we
agree
to
this
program
shortly
after
ford
do
although
we
disagreed
with
several
aspect
of
the
plan
ultimately
the
entire
industry
concede
the
point
actually
we
at
general
motor
have
be
consider
alternative
plan
of
this
broad
type
for
about
two
decade
in
december
before
the
state
unemployment
insurance
law
be
on
the
book
some
thought
on
a
private
insurance
program
for
the
corporation
s
own
employee
be
outline
among
the
idea
suggest
we
endorse
these
general
motor
subscribes
to
the
principle
of
accumulate
reserve
to
be
paid
to
employee
in
period
of
involuntary
unemployment
we
also
subscribe
to
the
principle
of
joint
contribution
to
such
reserve
by
both
employer
and
eligible
employee
we
also
believe
in
the
justice
of
a
probationary
period
before
any
employee
becomes
eligible
i
be
impressed
with
the
merit
of
these
point
and
so
i
think
be
most
of
my
colleague
however
the
sudden
growth
in
federal
and
state
unemployment
insurance
program
in
the
mid
s
alter
our
perspective
on
the
problem
with
insurance
against
unemployment
now
available
we
developed
a
program
design
to
allay
the
hardship
cause
by
our
cyclical
production
it
work
in
general
this
way
any
employee
with
five
year
seniority
who
be
temporarily
laid
off
in
a
model

over
for
example
or
who
be

less
than
twenty
four
hour

in
a
week
could
borrow
from
the

each

the
difference
between
his

and
twenty

in

when
he

an

he
would

the

of

half
of

the
case
of

more
than

with
a
maximum

in

the

of
our

more
evenly
over
the
entire

the
program

discontinue
when
defense
production
make
it
unnecessary
in
addition
to
this
program
of
interest
free
loan
we
begin
to
consider
whether
we
could
somehow
guarantee
a
substantial
proportion
of
our
worker
some
minimum
number
of
work
hour
during
a
year
the
social
security
act
of
include
one
section
which
be
intend
to
give
employer
an
incentive
to
devise
such
plan
under
this
section
employer
who
guaranteed
their
worker
hour
of
work
a
year
be
exempt
from
pay
the
percent
payroll
tax
we
seriously
consider
offering
some
such
guarantee
to
our
worker
in
however
donaldson
brown
then
vice
chairman
of
the
board
state
the
case
against
it
very
persuasively
in
a
memorandum
to
me
date
july
mr
brown
argue
that
the
guarantee
could
not
be
extend
to
very
many
worker
or
that
if
it
could
these
worker
could
not
be
guaranteed
very
many
hour
far
he
say
the
extension
of
a
guaranteed
annual
number
of
hour
of
employment
to
a
give
segment
of
the
employee
inevitably
will
tend
to
freeze
the
average
hour
of
employment
at
that
level
a
plan
of
the
kind
would
be
take
as
imply
the
purpose
in
event
of
decline
business
to
spread
work
to
the
end
of
average
hour
at
the
guaranteed
level
union
pressure
towards
this
result
inevitably
would
be
exert
all
of
us
be
dubious
about
the
feasibility
of
work
share
in
such
a
large
and
complex
organization
as
general
motor
personally
i
regard
work
share
at
low
level
of
hour
over
long
period
as
unsound
economically
and
socially
but
in
the
early
post
war
period
i
felt
that
the
corporation
would
have
to
devise
some
kind
of
guarantee
on
may
i
express
my
view
on
supplementary
unemployment
compensation
if
we
could
determine
what
the
limitation
be
we
might
get
ahead
of
the
pressure
that
be
go
to
be
put
on
us
and
determine
in
our
own
way
and
in
a
factual
way
just
how
far
it
would
be
practical
to
go
which
might
result
in
a
well
relationship
between
our
people
and
ourselves
without
the
liability
of
pay
for
work
that
be
not
accomplish
on
balance
the
plan
which
be
finally
write
into
the
contract
seem
to
me
to
represent
less
of
an
innovation
than
its
proponent
believe
it
to
be
as
many
economist
have
point
out
the
plan
be
merely
another
extension
of
unemployment
insurance
which
have
be
in
effect
for
more
than
twenty
year
and
which
have
always
be
finance
by
the
employer
i
suspect
that
the
real
benefit
of
the
new
plan
be
not
simply
the
degree
of
protection
it
will
give
to
worker
in
slack
period
after
all
many
worker
will
always
be
ineligible
for
coverage
and
many
other
worker
will
receive
only
small
payment
rather
it
be
that
the
plan
give
our
worker
a
great
feel
of
economic
security
and
perhaps
in
the
long
run
that
be
merit
enough
before
general
motor
have
no
dealing
with
labor
union
except
for
a
few
craft
organization
in
the
construction
field
for
this
and
perhaps
other
reason
we
be
largely
unprepared
for
the
change
in
political
climate
and
the
growth
of
unionism
that
begin
in
one
be
inclined
to
forget
that
unionization
in
large
industry
be
not
then
the
custom
in
the
united
state
the
significance
of
large
scale
unionization
be
not
yet
clear
to
us
we
knew
that
some
political
radical
regard
union
as
instrument
for
the
attainment
of
power
but
even
orthodox
business
unionism
seem
to
us
a
potential
threat
to
the
prerogative
of
management
as
a
businessman
i
be
unaccustomed
to
the
whole
idea
our
early
experience
with
the
af
of
l
union
in
the
automobile
industry
be
unhappy
the
chief
issue
with
these
union
become
organizational
they
demand
that
they
represent
all
our
worker
even
those
who
do
not
want
to
be
represent
by
them
our
initial
encounter
with
the
cio
be
even
more
unhappy
for
that
organization
attempt
to
enforce
its
demand
for
exclusive
recognition
by
the
most
terrible
act
of
violence
and
finally
seize
our
property
in
the
sit
down
strike
of
i
have
no
desire
to
revive
the
bitter
controversy
that
arose
over
these
early
encounter
with
labor
organization
i
mention
them
merely
to
suggest
one
of
the
reason
why
our
initial
reaction
to
unionism
be
negative
what
make
the
prospect
seem
especially
grim
in
those
early
year
be
the
persistent
union
attempt
to
invade
basic
management
prerogative
our
right
to
determine
production
schedule
to
set
work
standard
and
to
discipline
worker
be
all
suddenly
call
into
question
add
to
this
the
recurrent
tendency
of
the
union
to
inject
itself
into
pricing
policy
and
it
be
easy
to
understand
why
it
seem
to
some
corporate
official
as
though
the
union
might
one
day
be
virtually
in
control
of
our
operation
in
the
end
we
be
fairly
successful
in
combat
these
invasion
of
management
right
there
be
no
longer
any
real
doubt
that
pricing
be
a
management
not
a
union
function
so
far
as
our
operation
be
concerned
we
have
move
to
codify
certain
practice
to
discus
worker
grievance
with
union
representative
and
to
submit
for
arbitration
the
few
grievance
that
remain
unsettled
but
on
the
whole
we
have
retain
all
the
basic
power
to
manage

in

throughout
the

one
of
the
obstacle
to
integrate
the

be
the
fact
that

have
little

of
how
much
the

inevitably
this

exaggerated
the
self
interest
of
each
division
at
the
expense
of
the
interest
of
the

itself
it
be
even
possible
for
a
division
manager
to
act
contrary

sharply
no

the

i
be
confident

the
fact
that

create
a

with
a
heavy
personal
stake
in
the
success
of
the
corporation
as
a
whole
manager
security
company
be
certainly
a
great
individual
financial
incentive
but
as
walter

jr
of

have
write
me
it
also
support
the

and
lead
to
great
cooperation
mr

say
the
importance
of
manager

company
be
that
it
create
in
these
many
individual
an
urgent
and
continue
desire
to
make
a
success
of
the
whole
as
distinguish
from
their
previous
parochial
and
separate
interest
you
know
perhaps
as
well
as
anyone
that
the
design
of
that
so
call
financial
mechanism
be
such
that
the
benefit
of
the
earnings
of
the
corporation
as
a
whole
be
pyramid
in
a
form
to
give
a
tremendous
leverage
upon
the
individual
s
participation
in
the
result
that
be
now
so
old
and
have
be
use
so
much
that
we
accept
it
now
as
more
or
less
a
matter
of
course
we
must
recognize
that
in
that
form
and
at
that
time
it
be
quite
new
and
in
that
way
contribute
enormously
to
the
drive

determination
to
make
the

as
a

a

this
of

in

facilitate
the
development
of

and
correlation
and
interdependence
all
of
which
later
played
such
an
important
part
in
the
success
of
that
corporation
at
the
close
of

this
give
me
a
chance
to
emphasize
the
mutuality

the

of
the

be
similar
to
that
of
the
manager

company
though
the
technique
be
in
some
respect
necessarily
different
it
too

set
up
to
give
our

fell
below

so
no

down

in

be

the

general

seriously
embarrass
by

to
the
extent
of
their
accumulate
normal
annual

and
their

i
urge
the
finance
committee
of

therefore
to
make
some
adjustment
so
that
executive
would
not
see
their

swallow
up
each

in
the

in
urge
the

to
take
action
i
be
guide
by
concern
for
the
well
be
of
the
general

as
much
as
that
of
the
general

executive
one
be
intimately
related
to
the
other
i
felt
it
crucial
to
the
best
interest
of
all
concerned
in
general

to
restore
executive
morale
the
finance
committee
be
reluctant
to
offer
any
relief
at
first
because
it
felt
that
the
price
of
general
motor
stock
would
recover
nevertheless
in
after
much
consideration
it
adopt
a
revision
of
the
original
plan
this
revision
contemplate
certain
adjustment
in
the
capital
structure
of
management
corporation
as
well
as
an
adjustment
of
the
past
due
interest
on
the
bond
indebtedness
the
most
significant
change
however
be
a
provision
that
the
indebtedness
to
general
motor
at
the
expiration
of
the
plan
could
be
satisfied
by
delivery
to
it
by
the
management
corporation
of
the
entire
number
of
available
share
of
general
motor
common
stock
at
per
share
or
at
its
option
management
corporation
could
deliver
one
half
of
the
share
again
at
and
make
the
concurrent
payment
of
one
half
of
the
indebtedness
in
cash
this
provide
a
more
flexible
basis
for
the
handle
of
the
debt
as
matter
turn
out
the
finance
committee
s
original
judgment
be
correct
the
price
of
general

stock
recover
to

by
the
time
the
plan
terminate
on

by
use

this

to
the

while
the
management
corporation
do
not
prove
to
be
as
successful
as

it
do
accomplish
the
objective
of
increase

both

its

benefit
from
its

again
as

let
me
state
the
result
in

of
each

the

very
stimulate

judgment

with

the

have
climbed
fairly
steadily
and
now
be
about
a
year
in

it

be
the
practice
to

over

in
five
equal
annual

the
plan
also
contains
provision
under
which
an
employee
may
lose
his
right
to
earn
out
his
undelivered
bonus

if
he
leaf
the
employ
of
the

under
certain
circumstance
this
basis
of

recognizes
that
one
of
the
purpose
of
the

plan
be
to
furnish
an
incentive
for
executive
to
remain
in
the
employ
of
the

one
of
the
basic
purpose
of
our

program
be
to
make
our

partner
in
the

part

that

for

originally
the
entire
bonus
award
be
payable
in
stock
but
with
the
development
of
high
personal
income
tax
it
become
evident
to
the
bonus
and
salary
committee
that
deliver
the
entire
award
in
stock
be
futile
if
the
beneficiary
have
to
sell
a
large
part
of
that
stock
in
order
to
pay
the
related

therefore
in
the
corporation
adopt
a
policy
of
make
bonus
award
partly
in
cash

partly
in

the

the
careful

of
individual

be
very
valuable
from
the
standpoint
of
analyze
the
strength
and
weakness
of
the
corporation
s
management
personnel
this
be
particularly
useful
in
planning
ahead
and
prepare
for
inevitable
organization
change
the
value
of
the
bonus
to
general
motor
be
the
bonus
plan
really
worth
all
the
executive
time
and
effort
take
up
by
its
administration
and
be
it
worth
the
money
it
cost
i
believe
so
emphatically
i
be
convince
that
the
bonus
plan
have
not
cost
the
shareholder
a
single
dollar
but
have
on
the
contrary
greatly
increase
their
return
over
the
year
i
believe
that
the
bonus
plan
have
be
and
continue
to
be
a
major
factor
in
the
remarkable
success
of
the
general
motor
corporation
when
an
enterprise
be
new
and
small
and
be
operate
by
a
few
people
who
have
invest
their
own
saving
it
be
perfectly
apparent
to
them
that
their
own
interest
be
interwoven
with
those
of
the
enterprise
but
as
the
enterprise
grows
and
more
and
more
men
participate
in
its
management
this
connection
becomes
remote
and
need
periodic
expression
and
emphasis
such
as
the
bonus
plan
provide
the
bonus
plan
creates
different
kind
of
incentive
at
different
level
of
the
corporation
it
creates
a
tremendous
incentive
among
employee
not
yet
eligible
for
bonus
award
to
become
eligible
one
of
our
top
executive
recall
a
while
back
in
a
letter
to
me
i
well
remember
the
thrill
that
come
with
the
time
when
i
be
first
award
a
bonus
the
feel
of
have
make
the
team
and
the
determination
to
continue
to
advance
in
the
organization
i
believe
that
same
feel
have
be
share
by
all
who
have
have
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
bonus
plan
and
for
many
of
them
bonus
award
today
probably
comprise
the
great
bulk
of
their
personal
asset
since
bonus
be
award
annually
the
incentive
continue
as
long
as
the
man
stay
with
the
corporation
the
stimulus
in
fact
becomes
increasingly
effective
as
a
man
advance
in
the
organization
for
the
bonus
be
generally
large
in
relation
to
salary
at
high
salary
bracket
than
it
be
at
low
bracket
in
other
word
the
bonus
tends
to
increase
in
a
kind
of
geometric
rather
than
arithmetic
progression
as
a
man
be
promote
and
so
there
be
a
tremendous
incentive
for
him
not
only
to
do
the
best
possible
work
in
the
job
he
already
have
but
to
do
such
an
outstanding
job
that
he
will
be
promote
to
a
high
rank
the
incentive
and
reward
be
not
solely
financial
however
again
i
quote
from
the
letter
mention
above
there
be
still
another
value
which
i
be
sure
the
corporation
derives
from
the
administration
of
the
bonus
plan
it
be
the
intangible
incentive
it
provide
as
distinct
from
the
tangible
incentive
of
a
monetary
reward
the
potential
reward
of
the
bonus
plan
to
ego
satisfaction
generate
a
tremendous
drive
force
within
the
corporation
each
bonus
award
carry
with
it
considerably
more
than
the
intrinsic
value
of
its
cash
and
common
stock
to
the
recipient
it
be
also
an
evaluation
of
his
personal
contribution
to
the
success
of
the
business
it
be
a
mean
of
convey
to
the
executive
a
form
of
recognition
which
he
prize
independently
of
his
monetary
compensation
this
non
financial
incentive
be
reinforce
by
a
fairly
general
practice
of
have
each
recipient
s
supervisor
deliver
the
bonus
notification
letter
this
furnishes
an
opportunity
for
a
review
and
discussion
of
the
recipient
s
performance
one
important
side
effect
of
the
bonus
plan
be
that
it
make
each
participant
acutely
aware
of
his
relation
to
his
job
and
his
superior
he
be
oblige
as
it
be
to
dwell
on
his
own
and
the
corporation
s
progress
a
man
derives
satisfaction
from
know
that
his
superior
have
judged
his
value
and
at
the
same
time
there
be
the
spur
of
have
his
work
review
annually
this
kind
of
atmosphere
cannot
be
generate
or
maintain
under
a
straight
salary
system
or
a
salary
system
supplement
by
an
automatic
bonus
or
profit
share
system
in
which
an
employee
be
conscious
of
be
judged
only
when
he
receives
or
fails
to
receive
a
raise
and
penalty
be
more
difficult
under
the
usual
arrangement
for
salary
generally
be
inelastic
on
the
down
side
under
the
general
motor
bonus
plan
however
a
substantial
reduction
in
a
man
s
bonus
that
run
counter
to
the
trend
in
the
total
amount
of
bonus
award
constitutes
a
severe
penalty
and
one
of
which
the
individual
concerned
be
very
much
aware
the
total
amount
to
be
award
be
publish
in
the
annual
report
the
bonus
plan
also
provide
much
more
flexibility
on
the
up
side
than
be
possible
under
a
salary
system
it
may
be
difficult
to
reward
a
man
for
superior
performance
by
raise
his
salary
since
the
increase
may
upset
the
whole
salary
stratification
a
salary
increase
moreover
commits
the
company
indefinitely
whereas
the
bonus
make
it
possible
to
tailor
the
reward
to
the
period
in
which
performance
be
unusual
and
so
the
bonus
plan
make
it
possible
for
the
exceptional
individual
to
break
out
of
the
overall
salary
schedule
without
at
the
same
time
upset
the
schedule
the
bonus
plan
moreover
tends
to
keep
executive
with
the
corporation
as
explain
earlier
bonus
be
currently
paid
in
five
annual
installment
an
employee
who
leaf
voluntarily
may
lose
the
right
to
earn
out
the
undelivered
balance
of
his
bonus
in
some
case
a
very
substantial
sum
the
net
result
of
this
deterrent
plus
the
stimulus
the
plan
provide
have
be
that
over
the
year
general

have
lose
relatively
few
executive
it
have
wish
to
retain
especially
in
the
upper
level
in
the
last
analysis
of
course
it
may
not
be
possible
to
prove
the
success
of
the
bonus
plan
for
we
can
only
conjecture
what
might
have
happen
if
the
plan
hadn
t
exist
my
friend
and
associate
of
many
year
walter
s
carpenter
jr
have
express
my
own
sentiment
in
response
to
my
request
to
him
for
an
evaluation
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
bonus
plan
he
write
if
by
the
effectiveness
of
the
bonus
plan
you
infer
some
more
or
less
factual
perhaps
even
mathematical
proof
of
the
result
achieve
by
the
bonus
plan
i
will
have
to
admit
right
at
the
start
i
be
afraid
i
cannot
be
of
much
help
i
say
this
because
we
have
give
this
matter
a
great
deal
of
thought
over
the
year
we
have
consider
it
particularly
at
those
time
when
we
have
revise
the
bonus
plan
in
an
effort
to
ascertain
even
in
rough
measure
what
percentage
figure
we
should
use
in
derive
the
amount
of
the
annual
bonus
fund
again
each
year
we
have
give
this
matter
our
thought
when
we
have
endeavor
to
formulate
the
percentage
of
the
earnings
to
be
set
aside
of
course
all
within
the
maximum
provide
for
in
the
bonus
plan
itself
i
have
pretty
well
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
be
one
of
those
thing
that
we
have
to
accept
largely
on
the
basis
of
our
judgment
of
the
result
which
we
have
observe
during
our
experience
with
the
plan
over
the
long
period
of
year
to
this
might
be
add
our
confidence
in
the
general
underlie
philosophy
on
which
the
principle
of
the
bonus
plan
have
be
base
there
be
one
or
two
factual
circumstance
from
which
i
think
we
can
derive
some
measure
of
support
for
our
feel
that
the
bonus
plan
be
an
effective
tool
even
though
they
cannot
be
closely
measure
i
refer
first
to
the
fact
that
the
du
pont
company
and
the
general
motor
corporation
both
of
which
i
believe
have
be
the
most
prominent
exponent
of
the
bonus
plan
have
be
extraordinarily
successful
here
of
course
the
detractor
can
say
there
be
many
other
reason
for
this
success
and
no
doubt
there
be
it
be
however
impressive
that
these
two
company
have
be
outstandingly
successful
and
so
it
be
alfred
that
while
we
may
not
have
isolated
or
mathematically
demonstrable
proof
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
bonus
plan
we
do
have
to
support
our
assurance
in
its
effectiveness
the
record
of
success
of
two
great
enterprise
over
a
long
period
of
year
in
which
it
played
an
important
rol
e
we
have
evidence
of
its
contribution
toward
the
assemble
and
retention
of
an
organization
of
outstanding
men
and
we
have
in
addition
our
confidence
and
faith
in
the
basic
principle
on
which
it
be
found
to
this
i
should
like
to
add
my
own
profound
conviction
that
to
abolish
or
seriously
modify
the
bonus
plan
after
forty
five
year
of
successful
operation
might
very
well
destroy
the
spirit
and
organization
of
the
corporation
s
management
chapter
the
management
how
it
work
it
be
not
easy
to
say
why
one
management
be
successful
and
another
be
not
the
cause
of
success
or
failure
be
deep
and
complex
and
chance
play
a
part
experience
have
convince
me
however
that
for
those
who
be
responsible
for
a
business
two
important
factor
be
motivation
and
opportunity
the
former
be
supply
in
good
part
by
incentive
compensation
the
latter
by
decentralization
but
the
matter
do
not
end
there
it
have
be
a
thesis
of
this
book
that
good
management
rest
on
a
reconciliation
of
centralization
and
decentralization
or
decentralization
with
coordinate
control
each
of
the
conflict
element
brought
together
in
this
concept
have
its
unique
result
in
the
operation
of
a
business
from
decentralization
we
get

of

close
to
the
fact

in
short
all
the
quality
necessary
for
an
organization
to
adapt
to
new
condition
from
coordination
we
get
efficiency
and
economy
it
must
be
apparent
that
coordinate
decentralization
be
not
an
easy
concept
to
apply
there
be
no
hard
and
fast
rule
for
sort
out
the
various
responsibility
and
the
best
way
to
assign
them
the
balance
which
be
struck
between

and

and

of

the
concept
of
coordinate
decentralization
evolve
gradually
at
general
motor
as
we
respond
to
tangible
problem
of
management
as
i
have
show
at
the
time
its
development
begin
some
four
decade
ago
it
be
clearly
advisable
to
give
each
division
a
strong
management
which
would
be
primarily
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
its
business
but
our
experience
in
also
demonstrate
the
need
for
a
great
measure
of
control
over
the
division
than
we
have
attain
without
adequate
control
from
the
central
office
the
division
get
out
of
hand
and
fail
to
follow
the
policy
set
by
corporation
management
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
corporation
meanwhile
the
corporation
management
be
in
no
position
to
set
the
best
policy
since
it
be
without
appropriate
and
timely
data
from
the
division
a
steady
flow
of
operating
data
for
which
procedure
be
later
set
up
finally
make
real
coordination
possible
that
still
left
us
with
the
problem
of
find
the
right
combination
of
freedom
for
the
division
and
control
over
them
the
combination
could
not
be
set
once
and
for
all
of
course
it
varies
with
change
circumstance
and
the
responsibility
for
determine
administrative
organization
be
a
continue
one
thus
at
one
time
responsibility
for
the
style
of
the
car
and
other
product
be
vested
in
the
division
since
then
it
have
be
found
desirable
to
place
the
responsibility
for
develop
the
general
style
characteristic
of
all
our
major
product
in
the
style
staff
this
be
suggest
partly
by
the
physical
economy
to
be
gain
by
coordinate
style
in
addition
we
learn
from
experience
that
work
of
high
quality
could
be
obtain
by
utilize
corporation
wide
the
highly
developed
talent
of
the
specialist
the
adoption
of
any
particular
style
be
now
a
joint
responsibility
of
the
division
concerned
the
style
staff
and
the
central
management
such
continue
adjustment
in
the
relative
responsibility
assume
by
the
division
management
and
central
management
be
permit
by
the
decentralize
organization
of
general
motor
whenever
experience
or
change
circumstance
present
opportunity
for
improve
or
more
economical
performance
in
my
time
as
chief
executive
officer
only
a
modest
degree
of
supervision
be
actually
exercise
by
general
officer
over
division
manager
i
believe
that
basically
the
same
be
the
case
today
although
change
circumstance
and
new
and
more
complex
problem
have
result
in
a
somewhat
closer
degree
of
coordination
than
exist
in
my
time
in
general
motor
we
do
not
follow
the
textbook
definition
of
line
and
staff
our
distinction
be
between
the
central
office
which
include
staff
and
the
division
broadly
speak
the
staff
officer
be
primarily
specialist
do
not
have
line
authority
yet
in
certain
matter
of
establish
policy
they
may
communicate
the
application
of
such
policy
directly
to
a
division
the
responsibility
of
the
central
management
be
to
determine
which
decision
can
be
make
more
effectively
and
efficiently
by
the
central
office
and
which
by
the
division
in
order
that
such
determination
be
inform
and
knowledgeable
the
central
management
depends
heavily
on
the
staff
officer
indeed
many
of
the
important
decision
of
central
management
be
first
formulate
in
collaboration
with
the
staff
in
the
policy
group
and
then
adopt
after
discussion
by
the
govern
committee
consequently
the
staff
be
the
real
source
of
many
decision
that
be
formally
adopt
by
the
committee
for
example
the
basic
decision
to
participate
in
the
manufacture
of
diesel
locomotive
be
largely
base
on
product
research
by
the
staff
some
of
the
general
staff
activity
such
as
legal
work
have
no
counterpart
in
the
division
other
general
staff
activity
correspond
to
activity
in
each
of
the
division
among
them
engineering
manufacturing
and
distribution
activity
but
there
be
some
important
distinction
between
these
staff
and
divisional
activity
the
general
staff
be
concerned
with
longer
range
problem
and
with
problem
of
broader
application
than
their
opposite
number
in
the
division
the
correspond
divisional
staff
be
engage
largely
in
the
application
of
policy
and
program
already
developed
there
have
be
exception
to
this
however
as
when
a
project
have
be
approve
for
development
in
a
division
an
example
be
the
development
of
the
corvair
which
be
refer
to
in
the
next
chapter
the
economy
that
flow
from
central
office
activity
be
considerable
and
the
cost
come
on
the
average
to
less
than
percent
of
the
corporation
s
net
sale
through
the
general
staff
the
division
get
their
service
cheaper
than
if
they
provide
them
or
bought
them
on
the
outside
and
they
get
well
service
the
latter
feature
be
in
my
opinion
by
far
the
more
important
the
staff
contribution
in
the
field
of
style
finance
technical
research
advanced
engineering
personnel
and
labor
relation
legal
affair
manufacturing
and
distribution
be
outstanding
and
certainly
worth
a
large
multiple
of
their
cost
several
kind
of
economy
be
make
possible
by
centralize
staff
operation
among
the
most
important
be
the
economy
that
derive
from
the
coordination
of
the
division
these
arise
through
the
share
of
idea
and
development
among
general
officer
and
divisional
personnel
the
division
contribute
idea
and
technique
both
to
each
other
and
to
central
management
much
of
our
managerial
and
engineering
talent
and
many
of
our
general
officer
have
come
out
of
the
division
the
development
of
high
compression
engine
and
automatic
transmission
for
example
be
the
work
of
both
staff
and
division
our
progress
in
aviation
engine
and
in
diesel
engine
come
out
of
the
development
work
of
both
under
the
decentralize
operation
of
the
division
problem
of
like
kind
be
met
in
different
way
by
different
division
manager
subject
to
the
advice
of
the
central
office
of
the
corporation
out
of
this
process
come
a
winnow
of
technique
and
idea
and
a
development
of
judgment
and
skill
the
quality
of
general
motor
management
as
a
whole
derives
in
part
from
this
share
experience
with
common
goal
and
from
divisional
rivalry
within
the
framework
of
these
common
goal
there
be
also
the
economy
of
specialization
possible
under
our
decentralize
system
it
be
an
axiom
of
economics
that
cost
be
reduce
and
trade
create
by
specialization
and
the
division
of
labor
apply
to
general
motor
this
have
meant
that
our
internal
supply
division
which
specialize
in
the
production
of
component
must
be
fully
competitive
in
price
quality
and
service
if
they
be
not
the
purchasing
division
be
free
to
buy
from
outside
source
even
when
we
have
decide
to
make
an
item
rather
than
to
buy
it
and
have
establish
production
of
the
item
it
be
by
no
mean
a
close
decision
that
we
will
stay
in
that
line
of
production
we
try
wherever
possible
to
test
our
internal
supply
division
against
external
competitor
and
to
make
a
continue
judgment
on
whether
it
be
well
to
make
or
to
buy
the
popular
misconception
that
it
always
pay
to
make
an
item
yourself
rather
than
to
buy
it
be
base
on
the
assumption
of
a
cost
save
the
argument
run
that
by
make
instead
of
buying
you
can
save
the
extra
cost
of
your
supplier
s
profit
but
the
fact
be
that
if
the
supplier
s
profit
be
a
normal
competitive
one
you
must
expect
to
make
it
on
your
own
investment
or
else
there
be
no
net
save
general
motor
do
not
engage
in
the
production
of
raw
material
as
do
some
of
its
competitor
and
we
purchase
a
large
proportion
of
the
item
that
go
into
our
end
product
because
there
be
no
reason
to
believe
that
by
produce
them
we
could
obtain
well
product
or
service
or
a
low
price
of
the
total
cost
of

of
our
product

of

and

from
outside
source
account
for
to
percent
the
role
of
the
division
manager
be
an
important
one
in
our
continue
effort
to
maintain
both
efficiency
and
adaptability
these
manager
make
almost
all
of
the
divisional
operating
decision
subject
however
to
some
important
qualification
their
decision
must
be
consistent
with
the
corporation
s
general
policy
the
result
of
the
division
s
operation
must
be
report
to
the
central
management
and
the
division
officer
must
sell
central
management
on
any
substantial
change
in
operating
policy
and
be
open
to
suggestion
from
the
general
officer
the
practice
of
sell
major
proposal
be
an
important
feature
of
general
motor
management
any
proposal
must
be
sell
to
central
management
and
if
it
affect
other
division
it
must
be
sell
to
them
as
well
sound
management
also
require
that
the
central
office
should
in
most
case
sell
its
proposal
to
the
division
which
it
do
through
the
policy
group
and
group
executive
the
sell
approach
provide
an
important
extra
safeguard
in
general
motor
against
ill
consider
decision
over
and
above
the
safeguard
normally
imply
in
the
responsibility
of
corporate
officer
to
shareholder
it
assures
that
any
basic
decision
be
make
only
after
thorough
consideration
by
all
party
concerned
our
decentralize
organization
and
our
tradition
of
sell
idea
rather
than
simply
give
order
impose
the
need
upon
all
level
of
management
to
make
a
good
case
for
what
they
propose
the
manager
who
would
like
to
operate
on
a
hunch
will
usually
find
it
hard
to
sell
his
idea
to
others
on
this
basis
but
in
general
whatever
sacrifice
might
be
entail
in
ruling
out
a
possibly
brilliant
hunch
be
compensate
for
by
the
well
than
average
result
which
can
be
expect
from
a
policy
that
can
be
strongly
defend
against
well
inform
and
sympathetic
criticism
in
short
general
motor
be
not
the
appropriate
organization
for
purely
intuitive
executive
but
it
provide
a
favorable
environment
for
capable
and
rational
men
in
some
organization
in
order
to
tap
the
potentiality
of
a
genius
it
be
necessary
to
build
around
him
and
tailor
the
organization
to
his
temperament
general
motor
on
the
whole
be
not
such
an
organization
although
mr
kettering
be
an
obvious
exception
our
management
policy
decision
be
arrive
at
by
discussion
in
the
govern
committee
and
policy
group
these
be
not
the
creation
of
a
single
inspire
moment
but
the
result
of
a
long
process
of
development
in
deal
with
a
fundamental
problem
of
management
that
of
place
responsibility
for
policy
in
the
hand
of
those
best
able
both
to
make
the
decision
and
to
assume
the
responsibility
to
a
certain
extent
this
involves
a
contradiction
on
the
one
hand
those
best
able
to
assume
responsibility
must
have
broad
business
perspective
orient
toward
the
interest
of
the
shareholder
on
the
other
hand
those
best
qualify
to
make
specific
decision
must
be
close
to
the
actual
operation
of
the
business
we
have
attempt
to
resolve
this
contradiction
principally
by
divide
the
policy
make
responsibility
within
central
management
between
the
finance
committee
and
the
executive
committee
as
i
have
show
another
source
of
policy
recommendation
be
the
administration
committee
which
be
charge
with
the
responsibility
of
make
recommendation
to
the
president
with
respect
to
the
manufacturing
and
sell
activity
of
the
corporation
and
on
any
other
matter
affect
the
business
and
affair
of
the
corporation
that
may
be
refer
to
it
by
the
president
or
the
executive
committee
the
president
be
the
chairman
of
the
committee
and
at
the
present
time
its
membership
include
the
member
of
the
executive
committee
two
group
executive
who
be
not

of
the

the

truck
division
the

and
the

of
the
overseas
operation
division
under
this
separation
of
responsibility
policy
development
and
recommendation
be
mainly
the
duty
of
the
group
in
central
management
make
up
of
the
men
closest
to
operation
they
work
very
closely
of
course
with
men
from
the
division
and
divisional
men
be
on
some
policy
group
the
executive
committee
which
view
the
corporation
as
a
whole
and
at
the
same
time
be
closely
familiar
with
operating
problem
have
a
somewhat
judicial
function
it
make
the
fundamental
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
work
of
the
policy
group
and
the
administration
committee
plus
the
committee
member
close
knowledge
of
operating
condition
the
finance
committee
which
include
non
employee
director
in
its
membership
exercise
its
responsibility
and
authority
in
the
area
of
broader
corporate
policy
much
of
my
life
in
general
motor
be
devote
to
the
development
organization
and
periodic
reorganization
of
these
govern
group
in
central
management
this
be
require
because
of
the
paramount
importance
in
an
organization
like
general
motor
of
provide
the
right
framework
for
decision
there
be
a
natural
tendency
to
erode
that
framework
unless
it
be
consciously
maintain
group
decision
do
not
always
come
easily
there
be
a
strong
temptation
for
the
lead
officer
to
make
decision
themselves
without
the
sometimes
onerous
process
of
discussion
which
involves
sell
your
idea
to
others
the
group
will
not
always
make
a
well
decision
than
any
particular
member
would
make
there
be
even
the
possibility
of
some
average
down
but
in
general
motor
i
think
the
record
show
that
we
have
average
up
essentially
this
mean
that
through
our
form
of
organization
we
have
be
able
to
adapt
to
the
great
change
that
have
take
place
in
the
automobile
market
in
each
of
the
decade
since
chapter
change
and
progress
it
be
clear
from
the
event
and
idea
i
have
described
that
my
generation
have
an
opportunity
unique
in
the
history
of
american
industry
when
we
start
in
business
the
automobile
be
a
new
product
and
the
large
scale
corporation
be
a
new
type
of
business
organization
we
knew
that
the
product
have
a
great
potential
but
i
can
hardly
say
that
any
of
us
at
the
begin
realize
the
extent
to
which
the
automobile
would
transform
the
united
state
and
the
world
reshape
the
entire
economy
call
new
industry
into
be
and
alter
the
pace
and
style
of
everyday
life
it
be
our
satisfaction
to
assist
in
the
development
of
the
industry
which
in
this
century
make
individual
unit
of
transportation
available
to
almost
everyone
it
be
my
personal
satisfaction
to
be
associate
in
a
business
way
as
a
supplier
or
a
competitor
with
a
large
number
of
the
able
citizen
who
create
and
contribute
to
the
development
of
this
industry
the
name
of
a
few
of
them
by
their
association
with
car
and
company
stand
for
a
new
american
legend
for
me
because
of
my
age
and
past
association
it
be
natural
to
think
as
well
as
speak
in
term
of
mr
ford
mr
buick
mr
chevrolet
mr
old
mr
chrysler
mr
nash
mr
willys
and
so
on
involve
with
thousand
of
others
in
the
destiny
of
this
industry
they
conduct
the
prosaic
operation
of
run
a
business
without
be
aware
of
the
revolution
they
be
make
most
successful
enterprise
in
american
industry
have
tend
to
grow
general
motor
obviously
be
a
successful
enterprise
it
be
successful
because
it
be
efficient
and
it
have
grown
accordingly
it
be
not
surprising
that
the
large
corporation
should
have
become
a
feature
of
an
economy
with
as
much
vitality
as
ours
yet
it
have
its
critic
of
course
to
rational
critic
let
me
say
this
general
motor
have
become
what
it
be
because
of
its
people
and
the
way
they
work
together
and
because
of
the
opportunity
afford
those
people
to
participate
in
an
enterprise
which
combine
their
activity
efficiently
the
field
be
open
to
all
technical
knowledge
flow
from
a
common
storehouse
of
scientific
progress
the
technique
of
production
be
an
open
book
and
the
related
instrument
of
production
be
available
to
all
the
market
be
world
wide
and
there
be
no
favorite
except
those
chosen
by
the
customer
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
today
s
large
successful
enterprise
have
not
always
be
large
this
book
have
show
that
when
we
start
on
this
great
adventure
in
the
early
s
the
whole
automotive
industry
be
search
for
way
and
mean
to
find
itself
in
those
early
day
we
along
with
the
industry
lack
the
technique
that
today
be
take
for
grant
thing
just
seem
to
happen
to
us
and
to
the
industry
the
number
of
sale
by
dealer
be
unknown
the
number
of
car
held
by
dealer
be
unknown
trend
in
consumer
demand
be
unknown
there
be
no
awareness
of
the
importance
of
the
use
car
market
there
be
no
statistic
on
the
different
car
market
penetration
no
one
kept
track
of
registration
production
schedule
therefore
be
set
with
no
real
relationship
to
final
demand
our
product
have
no
plan
relation
to
one
another
or
to
the
market
the
concept
of
a
line
of
product
to
meet
the
full
challenge
of
the
market
place
have
not
be
thought
of
the
annual
model
change
as
we
know
it
today
be
still
far
in
the
future
the
quality
of
the
product
be
sometimes
good
sometimes
bad
we
have
to
start
from
that
begin
it
be
our
task
to
find
out
what
form
of
organization
be
suitable
to
our
company
this
meant
above
all
an
organization
that
could
adapt
to
great
change
in
the
market
any
rigidity
by
an
automobile
manufacturer
no
matter
how
large
or
how
well
establish
be
severely
penalize
in
the
market
as
we
have
see
be
the
case
with
mr
ford
in
the
s
when
he
stayed
too
long
with
his
old
and
once
dominantly
successful
concept
of
the
business
we
have
a
different
concept
of
the
business
which
we
put
into
competition
with
his
it
could
have
happen
that
he
be
right
but
for
that
to
have
occur
one
would
have
to
postulate
the
continuation
of
the
kind
of
national
economy
that
support
his
concept
of
the
automobile
as
it
happen
our
concept
be
more
in
accord
with
the
economy
the
progress
of
the
automobile
art
and
the
change
interest
and
taste
of
consumer
but
after
our
first
success
we
too
might
have
fail
there
have
be
and
always
will
be
many
opportunity
to
fail
in
the
automobile
industry
the
circumstance
of
the
ever
change
market
and
ever
change
product
be
capable
of
break
any
business
organization
if
that
organization
be
unprepared
for
change
indeed
in
my
opinion
if
it
have
not
provide
procedure
for
anticipate
change
in
general
motor
these
procedure
be
provide
by
the
central
management
which
be
in
a
position
to
appraise
the
broad
long
term
trend
of
the
market
this
be
well
illustrate
by
the
change
in
our
product
over
the
year
the
gradual
evolution
of
our
product
line
during
the
s
start
with
a
passive
adaptation
to
the
problem
of
the
market
and
proceed
to
the
policy
which
we
define
simply
as
a
car
for
every
purse
and
purpose
as
the
industry
have
grown
and
evolve
we
have
adhere
to
this
policy
and
have
demonstrate
an
ability
to
meet
competition
and
the
shift
of
customer
demand
i
want
in
this
connection
to
sketch
the
evolution
of
our
product
four
million
car
and
truck
be
sell
in
and
the
market
remain
more
or
less
at
this
level
throughout
the
s
during
this
time
our
product
be
improve
continuously
in
many
way
the
most
important
be
the
development
of
the
close
body
the
sale
of
high
price
car
rise
with
national
prosperity
in
the
early
thirty
during
the
depression
the
demand
reverse
itself
and
become
concentrate
in
the
low
price
area
in
and
almost
three
quarter
of
the
car
sell
in
the
united
state
be
in
the
low
price
group
we
adjust
to
that
demand
with
the
recovery
of
the
economy
consumer
again
sought
a
high
proportion
of
high
price
line
and
in
the
year
immediately
before
the
u
s
entry
into
the
war
the
low
price
group
be
accounting
for
only
percent
of
the
overall
market
or
about
the
same
proportion
as
in
the
year
we
respond
accordingly
with
the
resumption
of
production
after
world
war
ii
it
be
necessary
because
of
shortage
particularly
of
steel
for
the
industry
to
operate
under
material
control
these
allocation
favor
the
small
manufacturer
kaiser
frazer
nash
hudson
studebaker
and
packard
whose
product
representation
at
that
time
be
concentrate
in
the
medium
price
range
with
the
result
that
the
proportion
of
the
market
account
for
by
their
car
increase
sharply
competition
in
this
period
be
largely
confine
to
production
that
be
whatever
a
manufacturer
could
make
customer
be
wait
to
purchase
by
when
registration
of
new
car
approach
the
prewar
peak
establish
in
and
the
medium
price
group
be
accounting
for
percent
of
the
overall
market
and
nearly
equal
the
share
percent
account
for
by
the
low
price
group
in
the
year
after
normal
competitive
influence
begin
to
reassert
themselves
in
some
area
of
the
market
and
the
sale
of
the
small
manufacturer
in
the
medium
price
group
decline
on
the
surface
it
appear
that
customer
demand
be
return
to
the
prewar
pattern
by
the
traditional
low
price
group
seemingly
again
account
for
about
percent
of
all
sale
actually
however
a
significant
change
be
take
place
in
the
industry
s
product
offering
in
the
low
price
group
the
producer
in
this
group
along
with
others
be
offering
more
and
more
optional
equipment
to
attract
the
increase
consumer
purchasing
power
of
the
fifty
the
character
of
the
market
at
that
time
be
well
express
in
fortune
in
september
a
new
kind
of
car
market
as
follow
in
the
postwar
seller
market
it
the
car
industry
have
found
itself
sell
more
car
per
car
more
accessory

to

it
that

the

the

this

simply
a

of

a

the

be
modify
so
that
such

be
now
include
in
the
medium

range
it
be
interest
to
note
that
in
the
middle
fifty
so
call
strip
model
that
be
the
car
in
the
low

group
with
a
minimum
of

do
not
attract
many
customer
in
view
of
this
fact
the
upsurge
of
demand
for
the
so
call
compact
or
economy
car
which
gather
momentum
in
the
year
after
at
first
sight
may
seem
confuse
on
look
closer
however
it
be
evident
that
this
demand
be
essentially
a
far
expression
of
the
customer
s
desire
for
great
variety
throughout
its
history
the
industry
have
be
face
with
the
problem
of
try
to
anticipate
change
in
customer
preference
even
though
it
take
year
to
develop
a
new
product
it
be
our
job
to
be
ready
with
it
when
there
be
an
effective
demand
mr
donner
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
general
motor
recently
put
it
this
way
to
meet
the
challenge
of
the
market
place
we
must
recognize
change
in
customer
need
and
desire
far
enough
ahead
to
have
the
right
product
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
in
the
right
quantity
we
must
balance
trend
in
preference
against
the
many
compromise
that
be
necessary
to
make
a
final
product
that
be
both
reliable
and
good
look
that
performs
well
and
that
sell
at
a
competitive
price
in
the
necessary
volume
we
must
design
not
just
the
car
we
would
like
to
build
but
more
importantly
the
car
that
our
customer
want
to
buy
the
dramatic
event
in
the
market
of
the
late
s
and
early
s
be
a
good
example
of
how
rapidly
consumer
taste
can
change
and
also
an
example
of
the
industry
s
ability
to
respond
to
such
change
in
when
car
sale
reach
a
new
high
percent
of
the
industry
s
volume
be
account
for
by
standard
size
domestic
car
the
balance
of
percent
represent
few
than
car
include
some
forty
five
foreign
and
small
domestic
line
by
foreign
import
and
the
domestic
small
car
have
increase
to
percent
of
the
total
in
it
still
appear
far
from
certain
that
the
demand
for
small
car
would
continue
to
grow
but
the
possibility
have
be
recognize
by
general
motor
for
some
time
and
the
design
for
such
car
have
already
be
initiate
as
early
as
chevrolet
have
with
the
approval
of
central
management
set
up
a
research
and
development
group
charge
with
the
task
of
develop
such
a
car
which
would
be
ready
if
and
when
demand
rise
sufficiently
to
justify
volume
production
to
some
extent
this
activity
be
a
projection
of
work
do
prior
to
when
the
development
of
a
small
car
have
be
actively
consider
by
general
motor
the
design
of
the
corvair
be
make
final
in
late
and
the
car
be
introduce
in
the
fall
of
other
manufacturer
introduce
new
small
car
at
about
the
same
time
later
we
add
other
line
include
the
buick
special
the
oldsmobile
f
and
the
pontiac
tempest
all
introduce
in
the
chevy
ii
introduce
in
and
the
chevelle
in
while
the
small
car
be
design
to
appeal
to
the
economy
mind
customer
who
want
low
initial
cost
and
low
cost
of
operation
it
soon
become
apparent
somewhat
contradictorily
that
the
customer
have
not
lose
his
taste
for
the
comfort
convenience
and
style
of
the
regular
size
car
he
be
order
his
small
car
with
well
interior
appointment
convenient
and
useful
accessory
and
equipment
such
as
automatic
transmission
power
steer
and
power
brake
which
he
have
previously
specify
on
the
regular
size
car
the
corvair
monza
feature
automatic
transmission
bucket
seat
special
upholstery
and
deluxe
trim
be
brought
out
in
and
almost
from
its
introduction
account
for
well
over
half
the
corvair
sale
moreover
it
soon
become
evident
that
the
customer
want
the
small
car
in
the
same
range
of
model
and
body
style
that
be
available
in
the
regular
car
that
be
they
want
hardtop
convertible
and
station
wagon
as
well
as
two
and
four
door
sedan
the
addition
of
these
small
car
to
the
wide
range
of
standard
size
car
have
provide
the
customer
with
an
unprecedented
variety
of
model
from
which
to
choose
certainly
the
late
s
and
early
s
saw
the
most
dramatic
change
in
the
car
market
since
the
s
when
the
close
body
rise
to
dominance
the
model
t
come
to
an
end
and
the
upgrade
of
car
begin
the
event
of
the
past
few
year
in
the
car
market
i
believe
have
validate
the
general
motor
product
policy
that
we
formulate
in
john
gordon
president
of
general
motor
recently
observe
that
our
slogan
of
a
car
for
every
purse
and
purpose
be
as
appropriate
as
ever
indeed
we
have
never
offer
our
customer
great
variety
and
choice
than
we
do
today
in
the
model
year
the
industry
offer
model
of
domestically
produce
car
compare
with
in
general
motor
alone
have
model
in
compare
with
in
of
this
mr
gordon
say
take
into
account
all
of
the
color
available
and
all
of
the
optional
equipment
and
accessory
we
now
offer
power
assist
air
conditioning
tilt
steer
wheel
autronic
eye
and
so
on
we
could
in
theory
at
least
go
through
a
whole
year
s
production
without
make
any
two
car
exactly
alike
our
objective
be
not
only
a
car
for
every
purse
and
purpose
but
you
might
say
a
car
for
every
purse
purpose
and
person
the
trend
toward
the
small
car
be
clearly
visible
after
and
by
foreign
import
be
accounting
for
percent
of
industry
sale
in
the
united
state
while
domestically
produce
small
car
account
for
an
additional
percent
the
foreign
import
decline
in
relative
importance
after
and
in
be
accounting
for
about
percent
of
the
total
market
however
sale
of
the
domestically
produce
small
car
continued
to
increase
and
after
account
for
about
one
third
of
the
entire
market
meanwhile
part
of
the
formerly
low
price
group
have
become
establish
in
the
medium
group
in
the
face
of
these
trend
some
of
the
domestic
manufacturer
reduce
their
offering
in
what
be
traditionally
call
the

the

we
elect
to
maintain
our
regular
size
car
in
the
medium
price
group
at
about
the
same
weight
size
and
number
of
model
while
at
the
same
time
add
small
car
to
these
line
the
automobile
constitutes
percent
of
our
business
but
each
operation
or
potential
operation
be
consider
as
a
separate
problem
we
have
no
inflexible
policy
on
product
that
we
might
manufacture
but
motor
be
at
the
center
of
the
business
our
product
decision
must
of
necessity
be
in
part
empirical
and
actual
experience
with
some
product
may
suggest
that
they
be
not
well
suit
to
our
managerial
skill
in
such
case
we
withdraw
from
the
activity
for
example
in
we
found
it
best
to
withdraw
from
the
agricultural
tractor
business
because
we
do
not
believe
that
we
could
make
a
special
contribution
in
that
field
since
then
we
have
built
up
and
subsequently
dispose
of
interest
in
company
which
manufacture
airplane
household
radio
glass
and
chemical
we
enter
the
aviation
engine
and
diesel
engine
field
to
put
our
know
how
in
engineering
and
mass
production
to
work
and
create
new
value
we
developed
a
new
concept
of
the
diesel
the
two
cycle
engine
put
it
into
a
locomotive
and
revolutionize
the
american
railroad
we
pour
many
million
of
dollar
into
this
unproven
product
at
a
time
when
many
of
the
customer
for
it
be
in
serious
financial
condition
or
bankrupt
and
the
majority
of
them
appear
to
be
totally
uninterested
in
innovation
and
we
thereby
help
the
railroad
back
to
solvency
a
fact
that
be
acknowledge
by
railroad
management
today
in
none
of
our
product
market
do
we
achieve
a
prominent
place
by
buying
out
a
company
in
general
we
enter
each
of
our
related
activity
at
a
very
early
stage
and
then
labor
to
develop
the
market
for
our
product
whether
automobile
household
refrigerator
diesel
locomotive
or
aircraft
engine
we
have
not
bought
our
way
into

we
have
built
them
up
in

the
general
motor
organization
i
hope
i
have
not
left
an
impression
that
i
think
it
be
a
finish
product
no
company
ever
stop
change
change
will
come
for
well
or
bad
i
also
hope
i
have
not
left
an
impression
that
the
organization
run
itself
automatically
an
organization
do
not
make
decision
its
function
be
to
provide
a
framework

upon
establish
criterion
within
which
decision
can
be
fashion
in
an
orderly
manner
individual
make
the
decision
and
take
the
responsibility
for
them
the
men
who
have
make
general
motor
decision
in
the
year
since
i
retire
from
active
management
have
have
a
remarkable
record
of
success
in
tackle
some
very
complex
problem
in
no
instance
be
the
answer
explicitly
provide
by
the
automatic
operation
of
the
organization
the
task
of
management
be
not
to
apply
a
formula
but
to
decide
issue
on
a
case
by
case
basis
no
fix
inflexible
rule
can
ever
be
substitute
for
the
exercise
of
sound
business
judgment
in
the
decision
make
process
the
end
product
of
what
i
have
described
in
this
book
be
efficiency
use
that
concept
in
its
broad
sense
i
hold
that
general
motor
efficiency
and
growth
be
interrelate
in
our
highly
competitive
economy
and
i
hold
that
if
company
be
attack
simply
because
they
be
big
then
an
attack
on
efficiency
must
be
a
corollary
of
that
attack
if
we
penalize
efficiency
how
can
we
as
a
nation
compete
in
the
economy
of
the
world
at
large
so
far
as
i
be
concerned
my
work

long
