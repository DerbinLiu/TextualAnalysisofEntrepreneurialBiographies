man
a
memoir
by
the
co
founder
of
microsoft
chapter
opportunity
as
i
walk
toward
harvard
square
on
a
december
weekend
afternoon
in
i
have
no
inkling
that
my
life
be
about
to
change
the
weather
be
snowy
and
cold
and
i
be
twenty
one
year
old
and
at
loose
end
my
girlfriend
have
left
a
few
week
earlier
to
return
to
our
hometown
of
seattle
three
thousand
mile
away
i
be
three
semester
shy
of
graduation
at
washington
state
university
where
i
d
take
two
break
in
the
last
two
year
i
have
a
dead
end
job
at
honeywell
a
crummy
apartment
and
a
chrysler
new
yorker
that
be
burning
oil
unless
something
come
along
by
summer
i
d
be
go
back
myself
to
finish
my
degree
the
one
constant
in
my
life
those
day
be
a
harvard
undergraduate
name
bill
gate
my
partner
in
crime
since
we
d
met
at
lakeside
school
when
he
be
in
eighth
grade
and
i
be
in
tenth
bill
and
i
learn
how
to
dissect
computer
code
together
we
d
start
one
fail
business
and
work
side
by
side
on
professional
program
job
while
still
in
our
teen
it
be
bill
who
have
coaxed
me
to
move
to
massachusetts
with
a
plan
to
quit
school
and
join
him
at
a
tech
firm
then
he
reverse
field
to
return
to
college
like
me
he
seem
restless
and
ready
to
try
something
new
bill
and
i
kept
cast
about
for
a
commercial
project
we
figure
that
we
d
eventually
write
some
software
where
we
knew
we
have
some
talent
over
grinder
or
a
pepperoni
pie
at
the
harvard
house
of
pizza
we
fantasize
about
our
entrepreneurial
future
one
time
i
ask
bill
if
everything
go
right
how
big
do
you
think
our
company
could
be
he
say
i
think
we
could
get
it
up
to
thirty
five
programmer
that
sound
really
ambitious
to
me
since
the
dawn
of
integrate
circuit
technology
in
the
s
forward
thinker
have
envision
ever
more
powerful
and
economical
computer
in
in
a
journal
call
electronics
a
young
research
physicist
name
gordon
moore
make
that
prediction
specific
he
assert
that
the
maximum
number
of
transistor
in
an
integrate
circuit
would
double
each
year
without
raise
the
chip
s
cost
after
cofounding
intel
in
moore
amend
the
rate
of
double
to
once
every
two
year
still
dramatic
similar
trend
soon
emerge
in
computer
processing
speed
and
disk
storage
capacity
it
be
a
simple
but
profound
observation
that
hold
true
to
this
day
because
of
continual
advance
in
chip
technology
computer
will
keep
get
markedly
faster
and
cheaper
the
momentum
of
moore
s
law
become
more
evident
in
a
few
month
after
i
d
met
bill
i
be
sixteen
then
just
learn
to
program
on
a
mainframe
computer
a
japanese
company
call
busicom
ask
intel
to
design
chip
for
a
cheap
handheld
calculator
that
could
undercut
the
competition
busicom
assume
that
the
new
machine
would
require
twelve
integrate
circuit
chip
but
ted
hoff
one
of
intel
s
electrical
engineer
have
a
bold
idea
to
shave
cost
by
consolidate
the
component
of
a
fully
function
computer
onto
a
single
chip
what
come
to
be
call
a
microprocessor
before
these
new
chip
arrive
on
the
scene
it
take
dozen
or
hundred
of
integrate
circuit
to
perform
one
narrow
function
from
traffic
light
to
gas
pump
to
printer
terminal
microwave
oven
size
minicomputer
the
machine
that
bridge
mainframe
and
the
microcomputer
yet
to
come
follow
the
same
formula
one
chip
one
purpose
but
hoff
s
invention
be
far
more
versatile
as
gordon
moore
note
now
we
can
make
a
single
chip
and
sell
it
for
several
thousand
different
application
in
november
moore
and
robert
noyce
the
co
inventor
of
the
integrate
circuit
introduce
the
intel
microchip
at
a
price
of
the
launch
advertisement
in
electronic
news
proclaim
a
new
era
of
integrate
electronics
few
people
take
notice
of
the
early
on
but
i
be
a
college
freshman
that
year
and
have
time
to
read
every
magazine
and
journal
around
it
be
a
fertile
period
for
computer
with
new
model
come
out
almost
monthly
when
i
first
come
across
the
i
react
like
an
engineer
what
cool
thing
could
you
do
with
this
at
first
glance
intel
s
new
chip
look
like
the
core
of
a
really
nice
calculator
but
as
i
read
on
i
could
see
that
it
have
all
the
digital
circuitry
of
a
true
central
processing
unit
or
cpu
the
brain
of
any
compute
machine
the
be
no
toy
unlike
application
specific
integrate
circuit
it
could
execute
a
program
from
external
memory
within
the
limit
of
its
architecture
the
world
s
first
microprocessor
be
more
or
less
a
computer
on
a
chip
just
as
the
ad
say
it
be
the
first
harbinger
of
the
day
when
computer
would
be
affordable
for
everyone
four
month
later
as
i
continued
to
follow
the
chip
i
come
across
the
inevitable
next
step
in
march
electronics
announce
the
intel
its
bit
architecture
could
handle
far
more
complex
problem
than
the
and
it
address
up
to
sixteen
thousand
k
byte
of
memory
enough
for
a
fair
size
program
the
business
world
saw
the
as
a
low
budget
controller
for
stoplight
or
conveyor
belt
in
that
vein
bill
and
i
would
later
use
it
in
our
fledgling
enterprise
in
traffic
flow
analysis
but
i
knew
that
this
second
generation
microchip
could
do
much
more
give
the
chance
my
really
big
idea
have
all
begin
with
a
stage
set
development
in
this
case
the
evolution
of
intel
s
early
microprocessor
chip
then
i
ask
a
few
basic
question
where
be
the
lead
edge
of
discovery
head
what
should
exist
but
doesn
t
yet
how
can
i
create
something
to
help
meet
the
need
and
who
might
be
enlist
to
join
the
crusade
whenever
i
ve
have
a
moment
of
insight
it
have
come
from
combine
two
or
more
element
to
galvanize
a
new
technology
and
bring
breakthrough
application
to
a
potentially
vast
audience
a
few
month
after
the
be
announce
one
of
those
brain
wave
come
to
me
what
if
a
microprocessor
could
run
a
high
level
language
the
essential
tool
for
program
a
general
purpose
computer
it
be
plain
to
me
from
the
outset
that
we
d
use
basic
beginner
s
all
purpose
symbolic
instruction
code
the
relatively
simple
language
that
bill
and
i
learn
back
at
lakeside
in
our
first
computer
experience
the
late
minicomputer
from
digital
equipment
corporation
the
pdp
already
ran
the
more
complex
fortran
on
as
little
as
k
of
memory
while
an
machine
would
be
quite
a
bit
slow
i
thought
it
should
be
able
to
perform
most
of
the
same
function
at
a
fraction
of
the
pdp
s
cost
ordinary
people
would
be
able
to
buy
computer
for
their
office
even
their
home
for
the
very
first
time
an
basic
could
swing
open
the
gate
to
an
array
of
application
for
a
limitless
clientele
and
so
i
ask
bill
why
don
t
we
do
a
basic
for
the
he
look
at
me
quizzically
and
say
because
it
would
be
dog
slow
and
pathetic
and
basic
by
itself
would
take
up
almost
all
the
memory
there
s
just
not
enough
horsepower
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
after
a
moment
s
reflection
i
knew
he
be
probably
right
then
he
say
when
they
come
out
with
a
faster
chip
let
me
know
bill
and
i
have
already
found
a
groove
together
i
be
the
idea
man
the
one
who
d
conceive
of
thing
out
of
whole
cloth
bill
listen
and
challenged
me
and
then
home
in
on
my
best
idea
to
help
make
them
a
reality
our
collaboration
have
a
natural
tension
but
mostly
it
work
productively
and
well
long
before
come
to
massachusetts
i
d
be
speculate
about
the
next
generation
chip
which
have
to
be
come
soon
i
be
sure
someone
would
build
a
computer
around
it
something
like
a
minicomputer
but
so
inexpensive
that
it
would
recast
the
market
write
to
intel
to
find
a
local
vendor
for
our
traffic
machine
i
ask
about
their
future
plan
on
july
a
manager
name
hank
smith
respond
we
do
not
intend
to
introduce
any
chip
in
the
future
which
will
obsolete
the
our
strategy
will
be
to
introduce
a
new
family
of
device
which
will
cover
the
upper
end
of
the
market
the
point
where
the
leaf
off
up
through
mini
computer
the
introduction
for
the
new
family
of
device
be
target
for
mid
i
have
no
way
of
know
that
federico
faggin
the
great
chip
designer
be
already
push
intel
management
to
start
work
on
the
intel
to
be
herald
by
electronics
in
the
spring
of
the
new
microprocessor
could
address
four
time
as
much
memory
as
its
predecessor
it
be
three
time
as
powerful
and
much
easy
to
program
hank
smith
be
wrong
the
would
soon
be
obsolete
as
faggin
would
say
the
really
create
the
microprocessor
market
the
and
suggest
it
but
the
make
it
real
one
thing
seem
certain
the
met
the
criterion
for
a
basic
ready
microprocessor
as
soon
as
i
read
the
news
i
say
to
bill
this
be
the
chip
we
talk
about
i
regale
him
with
the
s
virtue
not
least
its
bargain
price
of
bill
agree
that
the
be
capable
and
the
price
be
right
but
write
a
new
basic
from
scratch
be
a
big
job
something
we
d
never
do
and
the
fact
remain
that
no
computer
exist
to
run
it
on
which
meant
there
be
no
market
you
re
right
it
s
a
good
idea
he
say
come
back
and
tell
me
when
there
s
a
machine
for
it
i
kept
prod
bill
to
reconsider
to
help
me
develop
an
basic
before
someone
beat
us
let
s
start
a
company
i
d
say
it
ll
be
too
late
if
we
wait
we
ll
miss
it
in
my
journal
entry
date
october
i
write
saw
bill
monday
night
and
we
may
end
up
write
basic
compiler
operating
system
for
but
that
be
wishful
think
bill
wasn
t
ready
and
i
couldn
t
forge
ahead
without
him
the
whole
point
of
my
move
to
boston
have
be
for
us
to
do
something
special
as
a
team
we
both
knew
that
big
change
be
come
but
we
didn
t
know
what
shape
they
d
take
until
that
chilly
december
day
in
harvard
square
out
of
town

sat
in
the

occasionally
nose
around
for
book

across
the
street
from
brigham

bill
and
i
go
for
chocolate

d
stop
by

check
on
periodical
like

popular
science

its
own

on

but
in
a

class
the
next
paragraph
clinched
it
in
many
way
the
altair
represent
a
revolutionary
development
in
electronic
design
and
think
its
central
processing
unit
be
a
new
lsi
large
scale
integration
chip
that
be
many
time
more
powerful
than
previous
ic

that
cpu
be
the
bill
s
get
his
answer
now
i
thought
i
slap
down
seventy
five
cent
and
trot
the
half
dozen
slushy
block
to
bill
s

in
harvard
s
currier
house
i
burst
in
on
him
cram
for
final
it
be
that
time
of
year
you
remember
what
you
told
me
i
say
feel
vindicate
and
a
little
breathless
to
let
you
know
when
somebody
come
out
with
a
machine
base
on
the
yeah
i
remember
well
here
it
be
i
say
hold
out
the
magazine
with
a
flourish
check
it
out
as
bill
read
the
story
he
begin
rock
back
and
forth
in
his
chair
a
sign
that
he
be
deep
in
concentration
i
could
tell
he
be
impressed
it
s
expandable
just
like
a
minicomputer
he
murmur
price
at
in
kit
form
scarcely
more
than
a
retail
chip
alone
the
base
altair
come
with
only
byte
of
memory
just
enough
to
program
its
light
to
blink
but
more
could
be
add
with
plug
in
memory
card
throw
in
an
input
output
board
and
an
i
o
audiocassette
recorder
or
a
rent
teletype
and
you
d
have
a
work
machine
for
under
two
thousand
dollar
affordability
would
change
everything
not
just
for
hobbyist
but
for
scientist
and
businesspeople
and
it
seem
likely
that
the
altair
could
run
an
interactive
language
like
basic
the
idea
dance
in
my
head
for
the
past
three
year
we
be
look
at
the
first
commercial
personal
computer
bill
set
the
magazine
down
and
we
plan
our
next
move
the
good
news
be
that
our
train
be
leave
the
station
at
last
the
bad
we
have
no
idea
if
we
d
be
in
time
to
board
though
the
article
make
vague
reference
to
basic
and
fortran
it
wasn
t
clear
whether
mit
already
have
base
language
available
or
in
development
in
either
case
we
d
be
sunk
hop
for
the
best
we
sent
a
letter
to
the
company
s
president
on
our
old
traffic
machine
business
stationery
imply
that
we
have
a
basic
ready
to
roll
out
when
we
didn
t
hear
back
we
follow
up
with
a
phone
call
you
should
talk
to
them
you
re
old
bill
say
no
you
should
do
it
you
re
well
at
this
kind
of
thing
i
say
we
compromise
bill
would
make
the
call
but
would
say
he
be
me
when
it
come
time
to
meet
with
mit
face
to
face
our
think
go
i
d
be
the
one
to
make
the
trip
i
have
my
beard
go
and
at
least
look
like
an
adult
while
bill
who
d
routinely
get
card
into
his
thirty
still
could
pas
for
a
high
school
sophomore
ed
robert
this
be
paul
allen
in
boston
bill
say
we
ve
get
a
basic
for
the
altair
that
s
just
about
finish
and
we
d
like
to
come
out
and
show
it
to
you
i
admire
bill
s
bravado
but
worried
that
he
d
go
too
far
since
we
d
yet
to
write
the
first
line
of
code
robert
be
interested
but
he
be
get
ten
call
a
day
from
people
with
similar
claim
he
told
bill
what
he
d
told
everyone
else
the
first
person
to
walk
through
his
door
in
albuquerque
with
a
basic
that
work
would
get
a
contract
for
the
altair
as
ed
later
retold
the
story
in
his
inimitable
style
he
d
settle
on
basic
because
you
could
teach
any
idiot
how
to
use
it
in
no
time
at
all
there
be
nothing
we
could
do
for
the
moment
he
say
mit
be
still
debug
its
in
house
memory
card
which
they
d
need
to
run
a
basic
demo
on
the
altair
they
d
be
ready
for
us
in
a
month
the
whole
conversation
take
five
minute
when
it
be
over
bill
and
i
look
at
each
other
it
be
one
thing
to
talk
about
write
a
language
for
a
microprocessor
and
another
to
get
the
job
do
later
i
d
discover
that
mit
s
own
engineer
doubt
that
an
basic
be
possible
if
we
d
be
old
or
know
well
bill
and
i
might
have
be
put
off
by
the
task
in
front
of
us
but
we
be
young
and
green
enough
to
believe
that
we
just
might

story
i
be
reading
on
my
own
well
before
kindergarten
i
can
remember
leaf
through
some
illustrate
primer
when
the
page
clicked
into
focus
and
the
word
suddenly
make
sense
not
long
after
that
for
christmas
i
be
give
an
oversize
picture
book
with
everything
a
four
year
old
could
want
to
know
about
steam
shovel
tractor
backhoe
and
fire
engine
i
read
that
book
every
day
see
my
interest
my
mother
have
a
friend
give
me
a
tutorial
on
steam
engine
it
wasn
t
very
technical
but
i
get
my
first
inkling
about
the
gear
and
belt
and
all
the
other
hidden
thing
that
make
a
machine
come
alive
that
book
open
a
new
world
to
me
soon
i
be
plead
for
one
on
gasoline
engine
later
i
progress
to
steam
turbine
and
eventually
to
atomic
power
plant
and
rocket
engine
i
d
pore
over
each
volume
not
get
all
the
detail
but
grasp
enough
to
satisfy
me
on
some
elemental
level
the
magical
become
logical
i
begin
to
understand
how
these
thing
work
at
age
three
i
go
to
mr
perkins
s
musical
preschool
down
the
hill
and
make
her
life
miserable
i
detest
stand
in
line
if
i
found
a
good
picture
book
i
would
not
eat
my
soup

we
have
no
idea
what
it
be
for
and
we
dare
each
other
to
turn
it
a
little
far
each

one
morning
i
say
what
the

the
valve
in
the
coatroom
i
slowly
raise
my
hand
and
say
i
do
it
i
think
he
be
surprised
that
anyone
would
confess
sometimes
i
could
get
absentminded
one
afternoon
i
set
a
book
down
before
a
dodgeball
match
and
then
straggle
home
without
it
the
principal
summon
me
the
next
day
and
ask
paul
why
do
you
set
your
math
book
on
fire
it
wasn
t
me
of
course
it
be
another
kid
who
d
found
the
book
and
probably
hat
long
division
despite
my
denial
the
principal
insist
on
call
my
mother
she
come
in
with
a
stern
look
and
declare
in
our
family

love
book
my
son
would
never
burn
one
case
close
i
knew
that
i
could
always
count
on
my
mother
s
support
each
morning
she
would
send
me
into
the
world
with
a
paraphrase
of
the
spartan
mother
farewell
to
their
son
march
off
to
war
go
forth
bearing
your
shield
i
walk
out
the
door
a
little
straighter
when
i
heard
that
my
father
be
like
a
john
wayne
character
big
and
strong
at
six
foot
three
a
man
of
few
word
but
with
a
huge
heart
and
a
strict
code
of
honor
he
be
serious
direct
and
deliberate
with
a
reason
for
everything
he
do
a
gentle
bear
of
a
man
for
all
his
gruffness
i
d
write
in
a
high
school
era
journal
he
believe
in
a
good
solid
purpose
in
life
he
could
surprise
us
though
one
halloween
as
my
sister
and
i
come
home
from
trick
or
treat
a
menace
figure
in
a
white
sheet
and
an
african
mask
jumped
out
at
us
with
a
terrible
yell
we
ran
into
the
house
shriek
totally
petrify
i
be
stun
two
day
later
when
my
mother
told
me
who
it
be
in
a
portrait
in
crayon
at
age
eight
i
drew
my
father
with
a
wrench
in
one
hand
and
a
screwdriver
in
his
shirt
pocket
a
doer
not
a
talker
when
you
live
with
someone
who
doesn
t
say
much
you
come
to
rely
on
intuition
and
body
language
i
could
always
tell
when
my
father
be
displeased
about
something
we
have
dinner
together
at
six
sharp
for
a
while
we
brought
book
to
the
table
but
then
they
be
ban
because
three
of
us
would
read
while
my
father
sat
silently
with
his
steak
after
grow
up
in
the
depression
he
love
have
sirloin
at
least
twice
a
week
generally
soft
spoken
he
d
resolve
any
issue
in
what
i
call
his
command
voice
he
wasn
t
flexible
or
tolerant
of
easy
excuse
if
you
d
agree
to
be
home
by
a
certain
hour
there
be
no
grace
period
he
quietly
held
us
to
high
standard
to
treat
people
honorably
and
stand
by
our
word
my
father
never
spank
us
he
motion
to
take
off
his
belt
once
or
twice
but
i
d
escape
with
a
fervent
promise
to
do
well
it
could
be
different
with
my
mother
a
softhearted
but
more
emotional
soul
one
even
i
ask
her
to
make
popcorn
and
she
agree
on
the
condition
that
i
d
clean
my
messy
room
an
oft
broken
promise
of
mine
the
next
morning
the
room
still
in
disarray
she
burst
in
with
an
open
can
of
jolly
time
pop
corn
flung
the
raw
kernel
at
me
and
cry
these
be
your
broken
word
which
make
me
feel
terrible
though
i
didn
t
much
improve
in
the
cleaning
department
another
time
when
i
come
home
two
hour
after
my
curfew
she
be
furious
i
be
small
enough
that
she
could
yank
me
up
by
the
leg
and
dangle
me
upside
down
don

pocket
and
past

head
to
the
floor

mother

a
naturally
gregarious
woman
who
could

ten
minute
conversation
with
the
grocery

lady
but
she

a
husband

of
it
as
a
lieutenant
with
the
st
quartermaster
railhead
company
in

and
it
still
tore
at
him
he

be
a
lot
livelier
and
more
talkative
my
mother
say
before
he
come
back
from
overseas
with
a
bronze
star
and
memory
of
a
dead
friend
i
be
still
young
when
my
father
first
ask
me
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
life
it
be
his
way
of
impart
his
laconic
wisdom
when
you
grow
up
and
have
a
job
do
something
you
love
whatever
you
do
you
should
love
it
he
d
repeat
this
to
me
over
the
year
with
conviction
later
i
d
figure
out
what
he
meant
do
as
i
say
not
as
i
ve
do
much
later
my
mother
told
me
that
my

wrestle
with
his
career
choice
he
suspect
he
might
be
happier
coach
football
than
manage
library
but
he
finally
chose
the
safe
and
practical
route
a
nine
to
five
life
under
fluorescent
light
lot
of
men
from
his
generation
do
the
same
but
he
want
me
to
choose
well
the
official
goal
of
the
seattle
world
s
fair
be
to
inspire
young
people
to
pursue
career
in
science
the
unofficial
goal
be
to
show
that
the
united
state
have
caught
up
to
the
soviet
union
in
technology
and
the
space
race
but
for
me
a
nine
year
old
who
d
just
discover
science
fiction

century
exposition
as
it
be
officially
title
revolve
around
my
favorite
thing
the
future
it
be
like
wake
up
to
find
my
most
outlandish
idea
make
real
just
four
mile
from
my
house
as
i
watch
the
fairground
take
shape
the
anticipation
felt
like
christmas
square
i
beheld
the
transportation
of
the
future
the
gleam
white
monorail
glide
along
its
mile
long
track
and
the
architecture
of
the
future
the
space
needle
then
the
high
building
west
of
the
mississippi
with
a
rotate
restaurant
on
top
that
look
just

beloved
synthetic
rubber
hat
with
earflap
the
one
i
wore
for
two
year
until
it
melt
on
a
radiator

jumping
out
of
my
skin
with
excitement

to
nine
plenty
of
time
for
my
mother
and
sister
to
roam
the
sprawl
ground
but
i
wouldn
t
budge
from
the
science
pavilion
i
ran
around
like
a
kid
on
a
sugar
high

for
what

to
be
a
hundred
yard
like
a
character
out
of
robert
heinlein
the
line
between
present
and
future

very
permeable

day

only
a
matter
of
when

back
for

eager
to
please
my
father
couldn
t
resist
share
dinner
from
the
table
carefully
cut
steak
into
bitesize
piece
breed
as
rat
catcher
back
in
england
manchester
be
highly
athletic
once
my
father
stop
feed
him
jett
would
leap
into
the
air
to
beg
for
more
at
first
it
be
funny
to
see
his
head
bobbing
up
above
the
tabletop
but
after
a
while
it
get
tiresome
and
jett
be
exile
to
the
basement
at
mealtime
one
day
i
d
be
work
on
a
chlorine
gas
generator
use
clorox
bleach
when
i
get
call
up
to
dinner
midway
through
the
meal
we
heard
a
strange
noise
somewhere
between
a
wheeze
and
a
choke
rasp
what
be
that
back
to
our
food
and
talk
we
heard
it
again
louder
this
time
clearly
come
from
downstairs
i
trail
behind
dad
who
push
open
the
basement
door
there
be
jett
quiver
at
the
top
of
the
stair
at
the
bottom
it
look
like
a
foggy
morning
on
the
okefenokee
with
two
foot
of
yellow
green
chlorine
gas
blanketing
the
floor
jett
have
make
the
smart
move
to
get
as
far
as
possible
from
the
toxic
fume
as
my
father
raise
the
basement
window
to
clear
out
the
gas
he
say
you
ve
get
to
be
more
careful
with
your
experiment
paul
but
i
also
heard
what
he
didn
t
say
he
never
told
me
to
stop
in
the
allen
household
child
be
treat
like
grown
ups
our
parent
encourage
us
at
whatever
we
try
and
expose
us
to
bach
and
jazz
and
flamenco
but
it
be
more
than
that
they
respect
us
as
individual
who
need
to
find
our
own
place
in
the
world
soon
i
be
buying
book
on
how
to
build
small
circuit
amplifier
radio
receiver
blinker
i
d
cart
around
a
shoebox
with
battery
and
light
and
switch
the
bit
and
piece
of
my
half
complete
project
in
fifth
grade
i
read
every
science
book
i
could
find
along
with
bound
issue
of
popular
mechanic
that
be
haul
home
from
the
university
library
to
be
devour
ten
or
twelve
at
a
gulp
the
magazine
commonly
have
futuristic
car
or
robot
on
the
cover
the
whole
culture
back
then
be
charge
with
scheme
and
speculation
about
technology
some
of
which
wound
up
come
true
by
sixth
grade
i
d
take
up
electronics
which
become
even
more
fun
when
i
found
my
first
real
partner
doug
fullmer
be
a
classmate
who
wore
heavy
horn
rim
glass
and
live
a
block
and
a
half
up
the
hill
we
be
the
kind
of
boy
who
could
talk
for
hour
about
physic
or
astronomy
living
at
the
cusp
between
the
analog
world
around
us
and
the
digital
age
about
to
engulf
it
we
couldn
t
learn
enough
about
either
one
later
an
electrical
engineer
at
raytheon
doug
share
my
excitement
when
my
dad
bought
me
a
van
de
graaff
generator
kit
it
have
a
belt
driven
motor
that
built
up
static
electricity
on
an
aluminum
ball
enough
for
a
two
inch
spark
or
you
could
put
your
hand
over
it
to
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
i
suffer
through
my
share
of
trial
and
error
once
i
nearly
electrocute
myself
when
i
grabbed
both
lead
of
a
transformer
at
the
same
time
my
muscle
clamped
up
for
ten
interminable
second
before
i
could
let
go
my
first
near
death
experience
but
i
like
electronics
because
its
application
be
open
end
and
you
didn
t
need
an
instruction
book
to
create
something
new
soon
my
jar
of
chemical
be
collect
dust
i
be
the
top
boy
in
my
class
but
i
couldn
t
keep
up
with
stephanie
hazle
because
i
get
b
s
in
phys
ed
and
spell
and
she
get
straight
a
s
i
be
third
chair
violin
and
stephanie
be
first
chair
and
she
be
smug
about
it
she
be
smart
and
superconfident
but
i
just
thought
she
be
mean
one
day
i
come
to
school
with
a
jerry
rig
step
up
transformer
the
whole
class
line
up
to
hold
the
bare
wire
contact
and
kid
giggle
when
they
felt
the
tingle
of
electricity
but
when
stephanie
s
turn
come
i
move
a
wire
that
raise
the
voltage
from
one
battery
to
five
i
knew
it
be
harmless
because
the
current
would
last
only
a
split
second
but
it
be
strong
enough
to
make
stephanie
scream
and
get
reprimand
by
the
teacher
all
the
other
kid
have
like
it
after
all
why
be
she
make
such
a
fuss
almost
instantly
my
guilt
overwhelmed
my
sense
of
satisfaction
and
last
a
lot
longer
i
still
cringe
when
i
think
about
it
the
force
of
nature
always
intrigue
me
i
be
spellbound
when
my
mother
told
us
about
the
time
she
and
my
father
outran
a
cluster
of
tornado
at
the
university
of
oklahoma
where
my
father
get
his
undergraduate
degree
after
the
war
my
mother
want
him
to
park
beside
a
ditch
under
a
big
tree
but
my
father
gun
the
car
and
kept
drive
until
he
get
to
anadarko
later
they
go
back
to
the
university
and
that
big
tree
be
just
go
one
day
in
sixth
grade
i
be
sit
in
a
temporary
classroom
for
orchestra
practice
when
i
notice
something
odd
the
nest
ring
of
light
fixture
hung
by
cable
from
the
ceiling
be
sway
like
pendulum
our
teacher
stayed
focus
on
the
score
until
she
finally
look
up
and
shout
everybody
out
of
the
portable
i
ran
onto
the
playground
my
violin
still
in
my
hand
and
found
the
asphalt
ripple
like
wave
in
the
ocean
that
s
really
strange
i
thought
later
i
heard
that
the
earthquake
measure
over
on
the
richter
scale
rumor
have
it
that
the
top
of
the
space
needle
swung
more
than
fifteen
foot
side
to
side
far
enough
for
water
to
slosh
out
of
the
restaurant
s
toilet
i
have
a
copy
of
the
sears
christmas
catalog
from
when
i
be
about
to
turn
eight
it
s
fill
with
item
to
quicken
a
boy
s
pulse
a
set
of
bongo
drum
a
student
microscope
to
reveal
the
invisible
world
a
seven
unit
lionel
electric
train
complete
with
guide
missile
for
blowing
up
the
boxcar
for
you
could
purchase
a
kit
for
the
brainiac
k
a
mechanical
brain
that
computes
reason
do
arithmetical
and
logical
problem
solves
puzzle
play
game
work
out
code
and
more
i
knew
from
science
fiction
about
big
machine
call
computer
that
do
wondrous
thing
but
it
be
all
vague
until
i
turn
eleven
when
my
mother
take
me
for
an
after
the
dentist
treat
a
trip
to
the
university
bookstore
passing
the
adventure
section
where
i
d
already
polished
off
the
like
of
tom
swift
and
his
fly
lab
i
chose
a
beginner
s
volume
about
computer
in
the
simplest
term
it
explain
the
fundamental
bi
stable
circuit
with
an
illustration
of
a
flip
flop
toggle
between
two
transistor
in
analog
technology
boost
the
input
amplify
output
much
like
increase
the
flow
of
water
from
a
faucet
but
as
a
true
digital
device
the
flip
flop
circuit
s
state
be
either
one
or
zero
on
or
off
that
book
strip
the
haze
from
computer
and
begin
to
teach
me
how
they
really
work
year
later
i
go
with
doug
to
a
science
workshop
at
the
seattle
center
the
former
site
of
the
world
s
fair
and
help
him
build
a
light
activate
robot
on
wheel
that
we
call
the
electronic
paramecium
long
before
star
war
it
resemble
a
scale
down
r
d
although
the
robot
never
quite
come
together
the
idea
that
we
might
do
something
so
sophisticated
be
almost
more
excite
than
the
work
itself
it
be
one
more
exercise
that
expand
my
sense
of
the
possible
back
at
st
vincent
de
paul
doug
and
i
troll
for
perfectly
good
television
with
blown
vacuum
tube
we
d
extract
the
tube
one
by
one
and
plug
in
spare
that
we
d
bought
for
a
dollar
when
a
set
be
beyond
repair
i
use
a
solder
iron
to
cannibalize
the
part
the
work
could
be
hazardous
one
time
i
heard
a
sizzle
sound
look
down
and
found
a
glob
of
solder
drilling
a
hole
into
my
knee
we
also
get
some
toaster
size
tube
radio
set
up
and
run
and
i
d
tune
into
local
station
for
rock
n
roll
or
r
b
those
late
forty
radio
become
my
gateway
into
popular
music
for
christmas
in
my
parent
give
me
a
three
transistor
sony
my
first
solid
state
device
impossibly
small
no
large
than
a
pack
of
cigarette
i
be
the
kind
of
kid
who
like
to
take
thing
apart
to
see
how
they
work
when
i
remove
the
radio
s
back
panel
to
install
the
battery
i
star
at
those
tiny
resistor
and
capacitor
and
i
thought
wow
i
need
to
learn
about
this
there
be
mystery
inside
there
i
felt
as
though
i
d
embark
on
a
quest
if
i
could
just
get
enough
of
the
detail
i
be
sure
i
could
figure
it
out
sometime
after
that
doug
introduce
me
to
integrate
circuit
where
transistor
be
embed
in
the
chip
i
d
read
about
the
new
semiconductor
industry
and
how
jack
kilby
of
texas
instrument
have
demonstrate
the
first
work
integrate
circuit
in
even
so
it
be
something
to
hold
one
in
your
hand
all
that
electronic
capacity
encase
in
one
miniaturize
container
while
i
didn
t
realize
it
at
the
time
i
d
begin
to
follow
the
path
foretold
by
moore
s
law
chapter
lakeside
lakeside
be
the
most
prestigious
private
school
in
seattle
and
i
want
nothing
to
do
with
it
my
ravenna
friend
be
move
on
to
seventh
grade
at
eckstein
junior
high
the
nearby
public
school
and
i
d
assume
i
d
be
with
them
bad
yet
lakeside
be
all
boy
a
grim
prospect
for
a
twelve
year
old
but
when
my
parent
heard
that
i
d
spent
most
of
sixth
grade
reading
on
my
own
in
the
back
of
the
room
they
decide
that
i
need
more
of
a
challenge
they
would
have
to
sacrifice
to
pay
the
lakeside
tuition
a
lot
for
a
middle
class
family
in
those
day
but
they
want
me
to
have
opportunity
they
d
miss
out
on
in
oklahoma
why
do
i
have
to
go
to
private
school
i
kept
ask
because
you
ll
learn
more
my
mother
reply
and
there
will
be
a
lot
of
other
smart
kid
there
it
ll
be
good
for
you
lakeside
s
entrance
test
be
famously
difficult
i
decide
to
fail
on
purpose
and
that
would
be
that
it
be
a
foolproof
plan
until
i
sat
down
with
the
exam
multiple
choice
with
lot
of
object
rotation
and
pattern
match
a
variation
on
a
standard
iq
test
this
be
kind
of
interest
i
thought
let
s
see
how
hard
these
question
be
i
decide
to
solve
the
first
set
just
to
see
if
i
could
and
then
compensate
at
the
end
with
a
bunch
of
wrong
answer
the
next
thing
i
knew
time
be
call
pencil
down
it
be
one
of
those
test
that
no
one
finish
completely
and
i
hadn
t
gotten
around
to
fill
in
those
mistake
but
i
be
sure
i
wouldn
t
be
admit
anyway
since
the
odds
be
so
slim
i
get
in
and
my
parent
be
right
it
be
really
good

me

i

more
intellectually
in

we

still

the

incalculably
complex
human

when
i
recently
reread

it
brought
back
the
image
of
a

who
be
fascinate
by

have
little
practical
knowledge
beyond
the
flip
flop
circuit
all
i
knew
come

from
thing
i
d
read
when
i
be

up
few
people
outside
major

have
ever
see

would
have
be

i
d
ever
lay

while
lakeside
seem
conservative
on

it
be
educationally
progressive
we
have
few
rule
and
lot
of
opportunity
and
all
my
schoolmate
seem
passionate
about
something
but
the
school
be
also
cliquish
there
be
golfer

tennis
player
who
carry
their
racket
wherever
they
go

in
the

most
everyone
go

i
d
never

option
we

who
d
take
a

in
punch
card
program
at

mr
wright
give
us
a
basic
manual

a

starter
problem
to
whet
our
appetite

then
he
let
us
loose
because
we
didn
t
know
the

we
devise
our

we
become

only
the
most
cursory
documentation
be
furnish
to

us
the

manual
be
fifty
odd
page
long
and
i
consume
it
in
a
day

two
i
memorize
the
twenty

so
main
keywords

how
certain
key
function
on
the

the
language
felt
foreign
for
the

two
and
then
it
be
oh
yeah
i
get
it
basic
be
a

easy
than
french
consistently
logical
no
irregular

when
i

i
d
ask
one
of

for

how
do
you
make
that
work
how
do
you
print

they
be
a

so
ahead
of
me

happy
to
show
off
what
they
knew
in

within

fred
wright
have
little
left
to
teach
us
now
and
then
he
d
pop
his
head
in
smile
and
say
how
be
you
guy
do
some
of
the
stodgier
teacher
grumble
that
we
have
too
much
freedom
but
mr
wright
love
rid
that
fine
line
between
control
and
chaos
unleash
our

it
s
hard
to

i
sat
down
at

with
my

take
several

come
the

i

soon
my

print
out
at
ten
character
per
second
a
glacial
pace
next
to

printer
but
exhilarate
at
the
time
it
would
soon
be
apparent
whether
my

work
if
not
i
d
get
an

message
in

case
i

correct
it

punch

delicate
maneuver
nowadays
handle
by
a
simple
click
of
a
mouse
and
a
keystroke
when
i
achieve
a
work
program
i
d
secure
it
with
a
rubber
band
and
stow
it
on
a
shelf
until
the
next

for
young
people
today
this
process
might
seem
hopelessly
laborious
like
crack
a
walnut
with
a
rube
goldberg
machine
but
for
high
school
student
in
the
late
s
it
be
astound
to
get
instant
feedback
from
a
computer
even
if
you
have
to
wait
several
second
for
the
machine
s
next
move
in
a
game
of
yahtzee
in
a
sense
that

computer
program
resonate
with
my
drive
to
figure
out
whether
thing
work
or
not
and
then
to
fix
them
i
d
long
marvel
at
the
innards
of
thing
from
transistor
and
integrate
circuit
back
to
that
young
reader
s

on

but
craft
my
own
computer
code
felt
more
creative
than
anything
i
d
try
before
i
sense
that
there
would
always
be
more
to
learn
layer

soon
i

it

that
such
a

exist
just
forty

channel
it
into
something
positive
as
i
later
told
a
seattle
journalist
the
most
effective
way
to
learn
be
go
hand
on
with
what
be
the
top
machine
of
the
time
learn
about
how
it
work
what
it
take
to
make
it
or
break
it
another
approach
be
to
stress
test
a
piece
of
software
until
it
fail
when
we
d
scribble
down
what
happen
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
move
on
the
ultimate
coup
be
to
crash
the
whole
operating

go

it

our

ten

fascinate
than
whatever
we

on
on

after
everyone
have
left
bill
and
i
would
go
dumpster
dive
in
the
building
s
courtyard
we
d
flip
up
the
metal
cover
and
i
d
interlace
my
finger
to
give
bill
a
boost
he
couldn
t
have
weigh
more
than
pound
he
d
lean
down
into
the
big
container
and
scoop
up
anything
that
look
promising
after
several
trip
he
found
a
treasure
a
stack
of
stain
and
crumple
fanfold
printout
i
can
remember
the
smell
waft
off
the
coffee
stain
and
think
this
be
a
little
gross
but
i
don
t
care
we
take
that
precious
hoard
back
to
the
terminal
room
and
pore
over
it
for
hour
i
have
no
rosetta
stone
to
help
me
and
understood
maybe
one
or
two
line
out
of
ten
but
i
be
blown
away
by
the
source
code
s
tightly
write
elegance
to
grasp
the
architecture
of
an
operating
system
like
top
i
knew
that
i
d
need
to
become
fluent
in
its
assembly
code
the
low
level
language
that
spoke
directly
to
the
machine
see
my
interest
steve
russell
take
me
aside
hand
me
an
assembler
manual
bound
in
glossy
plastic
and
told
me
you
need
to
read
this
in
line
with
the
do
it
yourself
ethos
of
our
world
nothing
more
have
to
be
say
thrill
i
take
the
volume
home
and
gobble
it
up
until
i
knew
it
backward
and
forward
one
week
and
page
later
i
d
hit
a
wall
the
manual
described
the
mechanic
for
write
assembly
code
but
neglect
to
explain
what
those
statement
make
the
computer
do
i
go
back
to
russell
and
say
i
don
t
understand
and
he
say
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
oh
you
well
read
this
and
give
me
another
page
in
a
white
plastic
cover
the
system
reference
manual
it
be
a
strain
to
get
through
it
and
after
two
week
i
realize
that
something
be
still
miss
though
i
hat
bother
russell
i
go
to
him
again
and
say
i
still
don
t
understand
how
can
i
send
character
to
the
teletype
and
he
say
ah
there
s
one
more
manual
you
need
and
he
come
back
with
what
look
like
a
phone
book
the
operating
system
manual
to
this
day
i
m
not
sure
whether
he
be
spoon
feed
or
haze
me
but
i
d
need
all
three
manual
all
along
it
take
several
week
more
for
me
to
take
my
first
baby
step
in
assembler
program
and
month
before
i
felt
confident
this
be
fascinate
stuff
i
told
bill
and
the
rest
but
they
be
engross
in
their
high
level
language
where
they
could
write
program
more
quickly
so
i
continued
alone
in
contrast
to
basic
or
fortran
where
each
statement
combine
many
instruction
assembly
language
be
a
direct
symbolic
one
to
one
representation
of
binary
machine
code
convert
into
text
and
symbol
that
be
easy
to
memorize
than
pattern
of
s
and
s
for
example
a
line
of
basic
might
read
a
b
c
when
write
in
assembly
code
the
same
statement
might
look
like
load
b
add
c
store
in
a
assembly
language
program
be
both
less
expressive
and
far
more
laborious
than
basic
and
where
program
write
in
high
level
language
could
be
port
to
different
cpu
with
minor
variation
more
or
less
like
related
dialect
assembly
language
be
unique
to
each
hardware
platform
as
distinct
as
german
be
from
portuguese
on
the
other
hand
once
inside
the
machine
assembly
code
could
excecute
up
to
hundred
of
time
faster
you
be
write
right
to
the
hardware
down
to
the
bare
metal
you
couldn
t
get
faster
than
that
a
lakeside
schoolmate
once
say
that
i
could
read
assembly
code
the
way
other
people
read
novel
but
i
don
t
think
it
come
more
easily
to
me
it
be
simply
the
place
i
chose
to
focus
where
the
rubber
met
the
road
i
be
finally
begin
to
understand
how
a
computer
work
at
its
most
fundamental
level
i
d
make
it
into
the
gut
of
the
machine
nothing
last
forever
and
there
come
the
day
when
c
cubed
finish
test
the
pdp
and
begin
to
charge
us
for
computer
time
with
the
mother
club
money
deplete
lakeside
shift
its
contract
to
c

by
that
point
we
have
individual
account
i
can
still
remember
our
account
number
mine
be
while
bill
drew
c
cubed
base
its
charge
on
a
complex
formula
involve
kilo
core
tick
of
cpu
time
and
disk
usage
and
we
constantly
worried
that
we
d
spent
too
much
before
mail
the
monthly
bill
to
our
parent
fred
wright
would
post
a
list
above
the
teletype
in
descend
order
of
charge
incur
and
you
d
pray
that
your
name
didn
t
land
in
the
top
three
i
cringed
when
i
set
the
record
at
the
equivalent
of
nearly
today
how
would
i
explain
to
his
credit
dad
take
it
in
stride
that
s
a
lot
paul
i
know
you
re
learn
but
can
t
you
cut
back
my
parent
saw
my
program
as
a
hobby
like
my
vacuum
tube
radio
or
darkroom
photography
only
a
lot
more
extravagant
bill
s
parent
felt
the
same
way
we
could
sense
their
patience
wan
late
that
spring
bill
and
i
get
hold
of
a
c
cubed
administrator
password
and
log
on
at
lakeside
soon
we
found
what
we
be
look
for
the
company
s
internal
accounting
file
name
acct
sys
it
be
encrypt
but
we
knew
that
it
contain
every
pay
account
and
also
the
free
one
our
hope
be
to
find
a
free
account
to
tap
into
we
knew
it
be
wrong
but
we
be
desperate
for
untrammeled
access
after
a
few
futile
attempt
to
find
a
specialized
program
that
could
read
and
modify
acct
sys
we
copy
the
file
to
our
directory
until
we
could
try
it
again
we
never
get
the
chance
a
few
day
later
we
be
summon
to
fred
wright
s
office
where
we
be
shock
to
see
dick
gruen
and
another
c
cubed
representative
an
unsmiling
man
in
a
dark
suit
we
hop
we
d
get
off
with
a
slap
on
the
wrist
consider
that
we
hadn
t
really
do
anything
yet
but
then
the
stern
man
say
it
could
be
criminal
to
manipulate
a
commercial
account
bill
and
i
be
almost
quiver
would
we
get
suspend
from
school
it
be
bad
than
that
you
stole
the
accounting
file
and
we
re
throw
you
out
the
man
say
our
c
cubed
privilege
be
withdrawn
through
the
summer
we
be
devastate
just
when
all
seem
lose
i
ran
into
a
friend
who
knew
a
uw
professor
with
a
free
c
cubed
account
once
lakeside
s
spring
term
end
i
go
almost
daily
to
a
terminal
in
the
electrical
engineering
building
i
picked
up
where
i
d
left
off
and
read
manual
over
hamburger
at
the
student
union
life
be
good
but
i
kept
mum
about
it
all
summer
i
d
nearly
reach
my
full
height
a
shade
under
six
foot
but
bill
and
kent
still
look
like
junior
high
school
student
i
couldn
t
risk
them
jumping
in
and
blowing
my
cover
bill
be
furious
when
i
finally
told
him
and
i
felt
bad
about
it
but
such
be
the
lure
of
program
that
i
knew
i
d
do
the
same
again
in
the
fall
of
my
junior
year
at
lakeside
my
sin
forgiven
and
my
sentence
up
steve
russell
and
i
struck
a
bargain
in
return
for
free
computer
time
i
d
try
to
improve
their
basic
compiler
as
high
level
language
have
grown
in
popularity
compiler
have
become
the
indispensable
middleman
they
be
the
translator
that
turn
high
level
source
code
into
object
code
the
binary
bit
and
byte
that
computer
could
actually
execute
like
all
dec
software
the
pdp
s
basic
compiler
be
open
and
extendable
you
could
freely
layer
on
new
feature
which
be
the
assignment
i
d
undertaken
it
be
a
stiff
challenge
for
someone
who
d
yet
to
enroll
in
his
first
computer
science
course
print
out
the
compiler
s
listing
be
as
thick
as
an
abridge
dictionary
and
it
take
me
day
to
gain
a
sense
of
the
whole
and
how
it
held
together
whatever
assembly
code
i
write
need
to
fit
the
program
s
logical
flow
word
by
painstaking
word
for
a
while
i
wonder
if
i
d
bitten
off
too
much
too
stubborn
to
ask
for
assistance
i
use
the
previous
programmer
comment
as
guidepost
for
every
ah
ha
moment
there
be
day
when
i
barely
have
a
clue
about
the
source
code
in
front
of
me
fatigue
be
no
factor
when
you
re
seventeen
and
caught
up
in
something
i
camped
out
at
c
cubed
as
long
as
my
eye
stayed
open
and
as
day
become
week
i
begin
to
eke
out
some
progress
since
i
d
found
it
painful
to
retype
whole
line
of
basic
program
whenever
i
make
a
small
mistake
i
adapt
idea
from
bill
weiher
s
line
editor
to
quickly
search
and
insert
single
character
and
i
religiously
annotate
every
step
as
per
our
mentor
protocol
for
anyone
who
d
come
along
later
to
build
on
my
work
again
i
do
all
of
this
in
the
minutia
of
assembly
code
like
an
apprentice
watchmaker
squint
at
the
tiny
wheel
to
understand
their
interplay
by
the
end
i
probably
knew
more
about
that
compiler
than
anyone
at
c
cubed
russell
and
gruen
seem
surprised
that
i
d
gotten
so
far
and
be
particularly
pleased
with
my
line
editor
a
beneficial
tool
for
their
customer
i
d
become
a
true
hacker
what
i
picked
up
over
those
two
month
form
the
basis
for
my
assembler
work
with
microprocessor
when
the
stake

be
much
high
then
as
now
teenager
be
often
underestimated
along
with
bill

ric
and
kent
i
d
show
how
much
young
people
could
grow
if
give
the
chance
we
be
still
year
away
from

we

they

even
after

early
in
my

at

i
brazenly
walk
through
a
door
and
into
uw

graduate
computer
science
lab
i
picked
up
a

and
take
my
seat
at
a
teletype
link
to
a
xerox
data

which
i
soon
have
figure
out
then
a

student
approach
to
ask
a

get
around
that
i
seem
to
know
what
i

do
i
be
roll
along
until
an
assistant

call
me
into

and
say
you
don

not

you

i

that
i

the

smile
and

all
right
i
ll
tell
you
what
if
you

my

you
can
stick
around
there
be
no

after
that
i
move
on
to
the
burroughs

and
a
powerful

call
algol
my
first
brush
with
batch
processing
a
step
backward
in

that
only
deepen
my

i
try
my

at
a

then
that
november

invite

my

to

a
big

for
us
before
drive

we
reconstitute
ourselves
as
the
lakeside

which
sound
grown
up
and
official
isi
want
a

that

write
in

a

use
in

application
in
return
they
would
credit
us
with
free

on
their
pdp
we
outline
our

and
submit
our
r
sum
s

just
turn
sixteen
have
write

we
get
the

as
it
turn
out
our

be
unfulfilling
cobol
be
a
cumbersome
wordy

and
the
accounting
program
a
slog
we
work
on
it
through
the
winter
use
uw

computer
science
lab
until
we
overstayed
our
welcome
in
a
letter
date
march
a
professor
name
hellmut
golde
complain
that
our

tends
to
disrupt
the
intend
use
of

he
append
a
list
of

include
our
use
of

at

all
of
them
simultaneously
for

period
of

in

of
these
and
other
occurrence
mr
golde
conclude
i
must
ask
you
to
turn
in
your
key
and
terminate
your
activity
in
the
lab
immediately
we
figure
that
the
grad
student
have
complain
to
him
and
move
to
some
teletypes
elsewhere
to
finish
the
job
while
we
never
saw
any
revenue
from
the
payroll
program
it
felt
like
old
time
to
be
back
on
a
pdp
and
we
begin
to
see
ourselves
less
as
hobbyist
and
more
as
people
who
just
might
make
a
living
by
write
code
have
haunt
the
stack
of
uw
s
computer
science
library
for
some
time
i
naturally
become
the
research
arm
of
the
lakeside
program
group
i
spent
countless
hour
bury
in
periodical
like

keep
up
with
the
late

i
dive
into

that
range
from
artificial

to

when
i
found
something

i
d
check
it
out

out
in

the

that
we
d
shift
from
one
topic
to
an
earlier
one
without
bother
to
acknowledge
the
new
context
someone
overhear
us

then
we

one
night
after
go
far
too
long
without

we
be
grind
away
for
hour
over
some
schedule
code
we
just
couldn
t
find
the

bill
kept
glare
at
the
problem
page
and
suddenly
he
say
x
and
collapse
into
helpless
giggle
i
take
another
look
and
saw
what
he
meant
we
d
left
a
meaningless
hang
variable
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a

x
i
shout
then
both
of
us
be
roll
on
the

call
out
x
in
the
empty
building

and
hysterical
for
break
we
d
go
to
the
movie
we
must
have
see
more
than
five
hundred
together
over
the
year
my
favorite
theater
be
the
kokusai
in
seattle
s
international
district
it
have
double
feature
with
english
subtitle
and
the
second
film
be
always
samurai
bill
didn
t
go
in
much
for
foreign
fare
but
one
night
he
agree
to
see
anything
but
one
of
those
stupid
movie
with
a
little
dog
in
it
no
sooner
have
we
settle
into
our
seat
for
a
contemporary
japanese
drama
than
a
noisy
terrier
be
run
across
the
screen
not
the
little
dog
bill
groan
out
loud
we
have
fun
that
summer
but
we
never
stop
think
about
our
next
business
opportunity
bill
have
take
on
a
data
processing
job
for
a
company
that
measure
traffic
flow
pattern
by
counting
the
car
wheel
run
over
pressure
sensitive
rubber
tube
at
fifteen
minute
interval
a
machine
would
punch
a
pattern
of
hole
on
special
sixteen
channel
paper
tape
represent
the
number
of
car
the
tape
have
to
be
read
manually
with
the
result
record
in
longhand
and
then
transfer
to
batch
load
card
the
process
be
monotonous
inefficient
and
murder
on
the
eye
bill
have
farm
it
out
to
young
student
at
lakeside
whom
he
paid
fifty
cent
a
tape
to
act
as
human
paper
tape
reader
one
day
he
say
those
kid
be
go
blind
try
to
read
those
thing
we
ve
get
to
find
a
way
to
automate
it
i
wonder
aloud
about
use
one
of
the
modern
minicomputer
the
late
texas
instrument
model
be
especially
compact
and
cost
in
the
low
four
figure
but
that
be
still
too
much
money
for
us
then
i
have
another
idea
what
about
intel
s
new
bit
microprocessor
the
base
on
what
i
d
read
the
chip
could
run
calculator
elevator
even
smart
terminal
since
its
release
that
spring
little
have
be
do
to
use
it
for
data
analysis
but
if
it
work
as
its
spec
suggest
the
would
be
up
to
our
task
we
could
make
our
own
chip
base
system
that
s
the
cheapest
way
to
do
it
i
say
as
bill
warm
to
the
proposal
i
add
a
salient
point
we
have
to
find
someone
to
build
the
machine
hardware
be
not
our
strength
so
we
d
need
a
third
partner
a
mutual
acquaintance
told
us
about
paul
gilbert
an
electrical
engineering
student
at
uw
and
we
tracked
him
down
later
that
summer
after
a
few
meeting
paul
have
a
workable
sketch
for
traf
o
data
the
name
we
d
use
for
both
the
traffic
machine
and
our
partnership
much
later
on
i
ask
bill
how
he
d
come
up
with
it
and
he
say
i
get
it
from
jack
o
lantern
i
thought
that
be
really
strange
in
that
first
flush
of
entrepreneurship
we
have
grandiose
dream
about
the
money
come
our
way
arm
with
our
easy
to
read
data
chart
on
hourly
traffic
flow
municipality
would
know
just
where
to
place
their
stoplight
or
to
focus
their
road
repair
wouldn
t
every
public
work
department
in
the
world
want
a
traf
o
data
machine
paul
gilbert
wangle
a
uw
discount
and
we
special
order
an
chip
at
a
local
electronics
store
bill
and
i
scrap
together
and
drove
by
to
pick
it
up
the
sale
clerk
hand
us
a
small
cardboard
box
which
we
open
then
and
there
for
our
first
look
at
a
microprocessor
inside
an
aluminum
foil
wrapper
stuck
into
a
small
slab
of
nonconductive
black
rubber
be
a
thin
rectangle
about
an
inch
long
for
two
guy
who
d
spent
their
formative
year
with
massive
mainframe
it
be
a
moment
of
wonder
that
s
a
lot
of
money
for
such
a
little
thing
bill
say
but
i
knew
what
he
be
think
that
little
box
contain
the
brain
of
a
whole
computer
we
brought
it
to
paul
gilbert
in
the
physic
building
and
he
set
to
work
in
develop
the
traf
o
data
software
bill
and
i
face
a
dilemma
we
knew
that
it
would
be
painful
if
not
futile
to
try
to
create
software
on
the
itself
we
need
to
build
a
set
of
development
tool
from
the
ground
up
include
a
customize
assembler
a
program
that
could
translate
assembly
language
instruction
into
actual
byte
while
the
could
address
k
byte
of
memory
bill
and
i
could
afford
only
a
quarter
of
that
in
memory
chip
not
nearly
enough
for
the
tool
so
how
would
we
program
such
a
limited
microprocessor
on
a
machine
that
didn
t
yet
exist
for
me
the
answer
seem
clear
i
d
simulate
the
environment
on
a
mainframe
simulator
have
first
cropped
up
in
the
literature
in
the
midsixties
when
an
engineer
name
larry
moss
devise
a
way
for
an
ibm
to
emulate
earlier
model
computer
and
run
their

moss
s
work
reflect
a
truism
in
technology
circle
that
harken
back
to
the
theory
of
alan
turing
in
the
s
any
computer
could
be
programmed
to
behave
like
any
other
computer
software
trumped
hardware
although
i
hadn
t
read
about
anyone
simulate
a
microprocessor
i
figure
it
should
be
easy
enough
i
d
simply
trick
a
big
computer
into
act
like
a
small
one
in
the
meantime
we
could
exploit
the
big
computer
s
abundant
memory
and
advanced
development
tool
we
have
no
idea
how
much
adversity
lay
in
store
for
us
use
uw

lab
equipment
and
facility
paul

a
half
back
when

come
out
to

during
a
hellacious
cold

and
we
walk
the

be
really
something
and
a
trw
manager
say
no
what
be
really
something
be
when
joe
forgot
to
put
his
bucket
down
and
drove
his
repair
truck
into
that
power
line
what
happen
to
him
there
be
incredible
spark
and
the
tire
melt
into
the
ground
the
manager
say
and
joe
freak
out
but
he
be
ok
because
the
truck
become
a
faraday
cage
in
the
s
british
physicist
michael
faraday
demonstrate
that
an
electrical
current
run
along
the
exterior
of
a
conductive
structure
have
no
effect
on
the
interior
the
trw
guy
burst
out
laugh
as
i
thought
oh
my
gosh
that
s
serious
electricity
with
its
bizarre
personnel
and
sunless
facility
rod
could
seem
very
strange
at
time
bill
and
i
be
the
young
worker
there
and
surely
the
low
paid
but
bob
and
the
other
manager
cut
us
no
special
slack
at
rod
we
learn
that
we
could
hold
our
own
with
some
of
the
top
programmer
around
i
have
to
write
a
thousand
line
of
assembler
code
not
too
heavy
a
load
but
a
tricky
one
two
other
programmer
have
take
a
crack
at
it
but
their
code
couldn
t
handle
the
corner
case
like
a
simultaneous
failure
of
two
or
more
device
i
opt
for
a
ground
up
rewrite
in
the
cleanly
structure
and
annotate
style
that
i
d
learn
at
c
cubed
i
spent
countless
hour
check
my
work
which
need
to
be
fail
safe
for
the
first
time
i
be
write
directly
on
a
run
operating
system
i
found
it
fascinate
freed
of
school
obligation
and
family
constraint
bill
and
i
happily
hunker
down
for
cod
session
and
test
cycle
that
ran
twelve
hour
and
more
we
be
both
natural
night

who
would
peak
at
ten
or
eleven
p
m
and
remain
at
optimal

for
quite
a
while
after
that
no
matter
how
long
it
take
we
d
stay
to
find
that
last
bug
when
bill
felt
himself
flag
he
d
grab
a
jar
of
tang
pour
some
powder
on
one
hand
and
lick
it
off
for
a
pure
sugar
high
his
palm
have
a
chronic
orange
tinge
that
summer
often
we
would
work
for
two
day
straight
and
then
crash
for
eighteen
or
twenty
hour
which
bill
call
get
slept
up
but
sleep
be
an
afterthought
we
have
our
lakeside
job
to
finish
for
the
next
term
and
the

ideal
for
the

the
class

and
sometimes
bob
barnett
come
in

to
find
the

slow
to
a

he
d

you
shut
your

at
the

movie
that
played
at

in

portland
we

until
someone
come
up
to
us
one
night
during
the
closing
credit
what
be
you
white
boy
do
here
that
threw
us
but
we
be
back
a
week
later
we
just
found
those
film
enthral
living
with
bill
i
saw
a
new
side
of
him
my
mother
have
a
term
for
adrenaline
junky
people
who
would
court
risk
for
the
thrill
of
it
that
person
she
d
say
be
an
edge
walker
bill
gate
be
an
edge
walker
he
d
pride
himself
on
make
the
mile
from
seattle
to
vancouver
in
under
two
hour
put
the
hammer
down
in
his
mustang
late
at
night
where
i
be
wary
of
physical
danger
bill
seem
to
enjoy
it
when
he
enter
our
apartment
one
day
in
a
full
leg
cast
i
ask
him
what
have
happen
waterskiing
with
barnett
he
say
they
d
run
out
that
afternoon
to
lacamas
lake
as
barnett
tell
the
story
he
d
take
his
last
run
and
want
to
get
back
to
rod
but
bill
insist
on
go
one
more
time
on
a
single
ski
in
his
rush
he
didn
t
bother
to
adjust
the
equipment
which
can
be
a
problem
if
you
like
to
jump
the
wake
of
the
boat
after
bill
fell
and
snap
his
leg
he
be
told
to
take
six
week
to
heal
back
in
seattle
he
resurface
in
vancouver
with
a
bluish
leg
and
no
cast
after
three
i
m
go
to
water
ski
with
bob
he
told
me
i
couldn
t
dissuade
him
and
his
leg
somehow
held
up
for
the
most
part
the
two
of
us
get
along
well
that
spring
and
summer
but
at
time
bill
could
get
edgy
especially
during
our
chess
game
i
be
a
more
methodical
player
my
opening
more
structure
bill
be
an
aggressive
improviser
when
i
beat
him
one
day
he
get
so
angry
that
he
swept
the
piece
to
the
floor
that
be
the
stupidest
move
i
ever
make
bill
shout
after
a
few
game
like
that
we
stop
play
once
i
d
decide
my
approach
i
be
able
to
crank
out
the
system
control
panel
code
pretty
quickly
the
weak
link
be
a
buggy
communication
module
that
prevent
my
work
from
be
test
in
real
time
until
after
i
go
back
to
washington
state
that
fall
rod
wouldn
t
be
officially
energize
until
more
than
a
year
later
in
december
after
untold
penalty
against
trw
before
leave
i
get
some
validation
from
john
norton
a
legendary
system
programmer
who
d
be
parachute
in
for
a
review
norton
could
take
an
inch
thick
listing
page
through
it
in
a
day
then
snap
it
shut
if
you
go
to
him
later
with
a
question
he
d
close
his
eye
and
say
go
to
page
you
ll
find
the
subroutine
you
re
look
for
it
be
a
proud
day
when
my
work
survive
his
scrutiny
in
my
off
hour
i
make
progress
on
my
traf
o
data
simulator
the
pdp
s
central
processing
unit
weigh
nearly
a
ton
but
my
program
need
to
get
it
to
behave
like
a
chip
half
the
size
of
a
pack
of
gum
my
first
task
be
to
define
a
set
of
thirty
or
so
macro
the
symbolic
instruction
that
would
generate
byte
for
the
intel
within
a
few
day
i
d
effectively
perform
a
brain
transplant
the
pdp
s
assembler
didn
t
know
it
but
it
be
now
an
assembler
my
next
step
be
to
build
the
simulator
itself
a
program
to
put
this
metamorphosis
into
action
write
in
pdp
assembly
language
the
simulator
would
mimic
the
microchip
s
instruction
the
cod
go
smoothly
it
be
as
though
everything
i
d
learn
at
c
cubed
and
isi
have
lead
me
to
this
point
fortunately
i
be
able
to
finish
my
week
s
work
for
bob
barnett
in
about
twenty
hour
then
focus
on
traf
o
data
after
go
hard
for
a
week
i
be
do
my
third
and
final
step
be
to
modify
the
pdp
s
debugger
to
give
bill
the
ability
to
stop
the
program
in
midexecution
and
track
the
cause
of
any
problem
the
debugger
be
an
ugly
hairy
piece
of
code
full
of
trapdoors
and
cul
de
sac
but
three
week
after
i
d
begin
we
have
an
unrivaled
development
suite
for
the
chip
my
technique
prove
so
effective
that
microsoft
use
them
well
into
the
s
until
microprocessor
become
fast
and
capable
enough
to
host
their
own
development
tool
shortly
before
we
return
to
school
bill
finish
the
traffic
analysis
program
we
test
it
on
the
pdp
with
hypothetical
data
and
the
simulator
generate
an
impressive
bar
graph
printout
all
that
remain
to
be
see
be
whether
bill
s
program
would
work
on
paul
gilbert
s
traf
o
data
hardware
our
dream
expand
bill
talk
about
start
a
real
company
while
i
share
similar
fantasy
mine
center
more
on
the
technology
it
be
clear
to
me
that
inexpensive
computer
would
transform
the
future
but
what
could
we
do
that
be
new
and
different
where
be
it
all
head
on
one
of
rita
s
visit
to
vancouver
i
take
her
up
to
trw
s
microwave
tower
and
expound
on
its
data
transmission
capability
and
what
that
might
imply
soon
i
say
there
would
be
high
speed
link
among
people
all
over
the
world
another
time
as
bill
and
i
din
at
a
local
pizza
place
i
have
a
thought
what
if
you
could
get
the
news
by
reading
from
a
computer
terminal
instead
of
buying
a
newspaper
you
could
even
program
it
to
find
article
on
whatever
you
want
wouldn
t
that
be
great
and
bill
say
come
on
paul
it
cost
seventy
five
dollar
a
month
to
rent
a
teletype
and
you
can
get
a
paper
deliver
for
fifteen
cent
how
do
you
compete
with
that
he
have
me
there
but
i
couldn
t
stop
think
about
a
time
when
everyone
would
be
digitally
connect
with
instant
access
to
information
and
service
it
would
be
a
while
before
bill
and
i
define
our
goal
in
so
many
word
as
a
computer
on
every
desk
and
in
every
home
but
the
seed
of
that
motto
and
my
notion
of
a
global
network
to
join
all
those
computer
together
would
be
plant
that
summer
among
the
strip
mall
and
fast
food
joint
in
vancouver
washington
we
be
midway
through
our
work
at
rod
when
bill
call
home
and
get
the
news
that
he
d
be
accepted
at
harvard
university
he
wasn
t
surprised
he
d
be
rid
high
since
score
near
the
top
in
the
putnam
competition
where
he
d
test
his
math
skill
against
college
undergraduate
around
the
country
i
offer
a
word
to
the
wise
you
know
bill
when
you
get
to
harvard
there
be
go
to
be
some
people
a
lot
well
in
math
than
you
be
no
way
he
say
there
s
no
way
and
i
say
wait
and
see
i
be
decent
in
math
and
bill
be
brilliant
but
i
spoke
from
experience
at
wazzu
one
day
i
watch
a
professor
cover
the
blackboard
with
a
maze
of
partial
differential
equation
and
they
might
as
well
have
be
hieroglyphic
from
the
second
dynasty
it
be
one
of
those
moment
when
you
realize
i
just
can
t
see
it
i
felt
a
little
sad
but
i
accepted
my
limitation
i
be
ok
with
be
a
generalist
for
bill
it
be
different
when
i
saw
him
again
over
christmas
break
he
seem
subdue
i
ask
him
about
his
first
semester
and
he
say
glumly
i
have
a
math
professor
who
get
his
phd
at
sixteen
the
course
be
purely
theoretical
and
the
homework
load
range
up
to
thirty
hour
a
week
bill
put
everything
into
it
and
get
a
b
when
it
come
to
high
mathematics
he
might
have
be
one
in
a
hundred
thousand
student
or
well
but
there
be
people
who
be
one
in
a
million
or
one
in
ten
million
and
some
of
them
wound
up
at
harvard
bill
would
never
be
the
smartest
guy
in
that
room
and
i
think
that
hurt
his
motivation
he
eventually
switch
his
major
to
apply
math
by
then
we
have
ambition
beyond
school
that
december
bill
and
i
redid
our
r
sum
s
not
quite
twenty
year
old
i
list
a
work
familiarity
with
ten
computer

high
level

the

certainly
look
authentic
quite
a
feat
on
a

paul
have
model
it

i
hooked
up
the

by

sink
in

then
i
load
in
a
small
test
program
through
the

on
the
front
panel
and
it
ran
successfully
but
we
still
couldn
t
be
sure
if
it
would
run
bill
s
traffic
analysis
program
because
we
couldn
t
find
an
affordable
reader
for
the
oversize
sixteen
channel
tape
at
wit
s
end
we
turn
to
a
local

who
design
a
contraption
that
read
the

hole
with
a
conductive
rubber

it
need
constant
tighten
and
seldom
fed
the

through
in
a
straight

but
it
be
the
best
we
could
do
at

that
may
for

s
king
county
engineering
department
the
tape
reader
malfunction
the
whole
thing
be
a
fiasco
bill
finally
broke
down

spent
serious
money
on
a
more
reliable

we

they

their

where
he
produce
the

just
as
we

washington
join
a

of
other
state
in
offering
the

we
didn

that
time

and
i
be
preoccupy
with
run
another
company
in
seattle
in
hindsight
traf
o
data
be
a
good
idea
with
a
flaw
business
model
we
have
do
no
market
research
we
hadn
t
foreseen
how
hard
it
would
be
to
get
municipality
to
make
capital
expenditure
or
that
official
would
be
reluctant
to
buy
machine
from
student
for
bill
traf
o
data
s
failure
would
serve
as
another
cautionary
tale
above
all
we
learn
that
it
be
hard
to
compete
with
free
bill
take
that
lesson
to
heart
year
later
he
d
become
obsess
with
linux
the
open
source
operating
system
but
there
be
positive
too
traf
o
data
bolster
my
conviction
that
microprocessor
would
soon
run
the
same
program
as
large
computer
at
a
far
low
cost
look
ahead
my
development
tool
for
the
would
give
us
an
invaluable
foundation
when
that
next
generation
chip
come
along
in
i
purchase
the
one
and
only
traf
o
data
machine
from
paul
gilbert
and
instal
it
in
our
startup
gallery
at
the
museum
of
natural
history
and
science
in
albuquerque
i
want
to
pay
homage
to
an
obscure
piece
of
hardware
that
played
a
critical
role
in
the
microprocessor
software
revolution
in
my
experience
each
failure
contains
the
seed
of
your
next
success
if
you
be
willing
to
learn
from
it
bill
and
i
have
to
concede
that
our
future
wasn
t
in
hardware
or
traffic
tape
we
d
have
to
find
something
else
chapter

through
the
spring
semester
of
bill
kept
urge
me
to
move
to
boston
we
could
find
work
together
as
programmer
he
say
some
local
firm
sound
interested
we
d
come
up
with
some
excite
project
maybe
an
extension
of
traf
o
data
maybe
something
new
in
any
case
we
d
have
fun
why
not
give
it
a
try
still
drift
at
washington
state
i
be
ready
to
take
a
flier
i
mail
my
r
sum
to
a
dozen
computer
company
in
the
boston
area
and
get
a
job
offer
from
honeywell
bill
receive
an
offer
there
as
well
and
it
seem
like
an
ideal
arrangement
we
could
make
a
decent
living
while
do
our
own
thing
on
the
side
then
after
i
accepted
the
job
and
prepared
to
take
another
leave
from
wazzu
bill
change
his
mind
and
decide
to
go
back
to
harvard
i
suspect
heavy
pressure
from
his
parent
who
have
more
traditional
idea
in
a
letter
to
ric
bill
write
they
be
more
in
favor
of
my
take
up
business
or
law
even
though
they
don
t
say
so
i
be
still
commit
to
the
move
if
boston
didn
t
work
out
i
could
always
return
to
school
in
the
meantime
i
d
sample
a
new
part
of
the
country
and
rita
have
agree
to
join
me
we
have
grown
more
serious
and
want
to
live
together
as
a
trial
run
for
marriage
plus
bill
would
be
there
at
a
minimum
we
could
put
our
head
together
on
the
weekend
my
dad
be
less
than
enthusiastic
this
software
work
seem
to
be
a
distraction
he
say
i
don
t
agree
with
your
choice
but
you
re
old
enough
to
make
your
own
decision
when
the
day
come
that
august
for
rita
and
me
to
leave
he
get
the
family
chrysler
wash
and
fill
it
with
gas
regardless
of
what
they
thought
my
parent
always
do
what
they
could
to
support
me
drive
cross
country
with
a
girlfriend
be
an
adventure
i
remember
how
long
it
take
to
cross
montana
and
how
we
reach
new
england
in
the
thickest
fog
we
d
ever
see
finally
get
lose
on
boston

we
found
an
inexpensive
apartment
in
tyngsborough
up
near
the
new
hampshire
state
line
rita
get
work
in
a
semiconductor
plant
nearby
as
i
start
at
honeywell
the
company
that
make
the

in
my
childhood
home
if
dec
be
the
cut

leader
among
ibm
s

honeywell
be
a

cocoon
where
people
punch
the
clock
as
though
they
be
work
for
the
phone
company
the
firm
be
know
for
its
low
stress
informal
work
culture
no
necktie
lot
of
bridge
game
at
lunch
the
manager
have
office
with
window
along
the
perimeter
while
the
programmer
work
out
of
a
large
bullpen
two
to
a
cubicle
my
colleague
be
nice
guy
in
their
thirty
they
be
solid
software
engineer
but
nothing
like
the
elite
at
c
cubed
or
the
crack
hire
gun
at
trw
they
have
no
hacker
ethic
i
be
assign
to
a
communication
protocol
that
would
link
multiple
honeywell
minicomputer
a
small
piece
of
a
big
project
within
a
turn
the
crank
environment
i
sat
in
my
light
brown
cubicle
and
write
anonymous
assembly
code
for
a
niche
market
machine
and
soon
i
get
bore
i
be
happier
in
my
spare
time
when
i
could
use
bill
s
password
to
hack
around
at
harvard
and
get
my
first
exposure
to
unix
the
multitasking
operating
system
from
bell
lab
that
have
take
university
by
storm
with
short
command
and
a
root
and
branch
file
system
unix
provide
an
easy
way
to
organize
file
and
it
could
run
on
hardware
cost
as
little
as
ten
thousand
dollar
here
be
a
parallel
compute
universe
that
seem
full
of
fresh
idea
and
it
make
my
work
at
honeywell
feel
even
staler
rita
and
i
have
come
to
new
england
know
two
people
one
be
bart
johnson
a
brilliant
troubled
lakesider
who
would
insinuate
that
he
be
work
for
the
mafia
bart
have
an
unusual
way
of
deal
with
parking
ticket
he
d
buy
a
junker
and
park
wherever
he
pleased
in
back
bay
until
the
ticket
overflow
his
glove
compartment
when
the
car
get
towed
as
it
inevitably
do
he
d
go
out
and
buy
another
one
then
there
be
bill
we
have
him
out
to
tyngsborough
in
october
for
a
birthday
dinner
for
him
and
rita
who
always
found
bill
entertain
back
in
pullman
she
d
roast
a
chicken
one
night
for
dinner
and
couldn
t
take
her
eye
off
him
do
you
see
that
she
say
after
he
d
left
he
ate
his
chicken
with
a
spoon
i
have
never
in
my
life
see
anyone
eat
chicken
with
a
spoon
when
bill
be
think
hard
about
something
he
paid
no
heed
to
social
convention
once
he
offer
rita
fashion
advice
basically
to
buy
all
your
clothes
in
the
same
style
and
color
and
save
time
by
not
have
to
match
them
for
bill
that
meant
any
sweater
that
go
with
tan
slack
that
november
rita
and
i
move
into
rindge
house
a
subsidize
development
in
cambridge
with
linoleum
floor
steel
door
and
legion
of
cockroach
after
my
chrysler
begin
burning
oil
i
bought
a
use
yellow
mustang
convertible
for
one
morning
i
climbed
in
and
turn
the
key
nothing
happen
someone
have
steal
the
battery
a
few
day
later
i
go
to
sears
and
return
with
a
new
one
again
i
open
the
hood
and
this
time
the
engine
be
go
i
give
up
on
my
convertible
which
be
ill
suit
for
that
whistle
northeast
wind
anyway
within
week
the
car
be
up
on
block
and
strip
clean
by
thanksgiving
rita
have
left
her
job
and
return
to
seattle
to
finish
her
degree
at
uw
rita
be
my
first
love
my
first
slow
dance
and
without
her
i
be
lonely
i
spent
more
time
with
bill
at
currier
house
before
his
nightly
poker
game
with
the
local
cardsharp
he
be
get
some
costly
lesson
in
bluffing
he
d
win
three
hundred
dollar
one
night
and
lose
six
hundred
the
next
as
bill
drop
thousand
that
fall
he
kept
tell
me
i
m
get
well
i
knew
what
he
be
think
i
m
smarter
than
those
guy
in
my
off
hour
my
thought
turn
to
microprocessor
a
few
low
cost
computer
have
be
built
around
the
intel
but
none
have
make
much
headway
the
french
micral
n
market
as
a
microcomputer
in
could
be
programmed
only
in
binary
and
be
use
in
highway
tollbooth
or
for
overseas
agriculture
project
the
scelbi
h
with
just
a
thousand
byte
of
memory
be
mostly
ignore
the
mark
come
in
a
kit
for
only
the
most
manic
do
it
yourselfer
with
the
advent
of
intel
s
more
capable
chip
in
april
technology
seem
ready
for
a
leap
but
the
springboard
general
purpose
machine
have
yet
to
be
built
i
wonder
if
we
might
draw
on
the
traf
o
data
design
to
create
an
driven
computer
that
would
rival
the
pdp
but
bill
found
that
unconvincing
then
i
counter
what
if
we
could
string
a
hundred
chip
together
to
make
something
cheaper
and
more
powerful
than
the
minicomputer
of
the
day
or
if
we
pool
a
bunch
of
bit
processor
slice
chip
to
emulate
the
ibm
at
a
fraction
of
ibm
s
inflate
price
each
time
i
brought
an
idea
to
bill
he
would
pop
my
balloon
that
would
take
a
bunch
of
people
and
a
lot
of
money
he
d
say
or
that
sound
really
complicate
our
traf
o
data
ordeal
be
still
fresh
in
his
mind
we
re
not
hardware
guru
paul
he
d
remind
me
what
we
know
be
software
and
he
be
right
my
idea
be
ahead
of
their
time
or
beyond
our
scope
or
both
it
be
ridiculous
to
think
that
two
young
guy
in
boston
could
beat
ibm
on
its
own
turf
bill
s
reality
check
stop
us
from
waste
time
in
area
where
we
have
scant
chance
of
success
so
when
the
right
opportunity
surface
as
it
do
that
december
it
get
my
full
attention

some
have
suggest
that
our
altair
basic
be
remarkable
because
we
create
it
without
ever
see
an
altair
or
even
a
sample
intel
the
microprocessor
it
would
run
on
what
we
do
be
indeed
unprecedented
but
what
be
less
well
understood
be
that
we
have
no
choice
the
altair
be
little
more
than
a
bare
bone
box
with
a
cpu
on
a
chip
inside
it
have
no
hard
drive
no
floppy
disk
no
place
to
edit
or
store
program
and
even
have
the
machine
be
up
to
it
debug
on
the
memory
challenged
would
have
be
slow
and
difficult
at
best
any
other
programmer
vie
to
bring
an
basic
to
albuquerque
would
be
face
an
uphill
climb
for
starter
they
d
have
to
realize
that
they
need
a
simulator
and
then
to
create
one
from
scratch
on
a
mainframe
or
minicomputer
bill
and
i
have
a
big
edge
in
speed
and
productivity
with
our
traf
o
data
development
tool
but
could
we
actually
write
a
basic
interpreter
our
game
plan
echoed
our
work
on
traf
o
data
i
would
generate
the
tool
the
macro
assembler
and
simulator
while
bill
take
the
lead
in
create
the
interpreter
s
design
in
contrast
to
a
compiler
a
memory
hog
that
convert
whole
file
of
source
code
into
assembly
or
machine
language
an
interpreter
executes
one
snippet
of
code
at
a
time
on
the
fly
which
would
minimize
an
altair
customer
s
outlay
at
the
time
k
of
memory
be
just
under
three
hundred
dollar
retail
a
fair
sum
in
but
not
a
deal
breaker
for
a
craze
hobbyist
it
would
be
tight
but
we
believe
we
could
squeeze
a
par
down
interpreter
into
that
k
with
enough
room
left
over
for
some
small
user
write
program
one
large
piece
of
our
basic
be
unaccounted
for
the
float
point
math
code
that
be
essential
for
manipulate
large
number
and
decimal
point
in
scientific
notation
one
night
bill
and
i
be
at
dinner
at
the
currier
house
cafeteria
where
advanced
math
student
would
chat
about
hypercubes
and
five
dimensional
geometry
i
be
worry
aloud
that
i
d
have
to
write
our
math
routine
myself
when
a
curly
haired
freshman
across
from
us
piped
up
i
ve
do
those
for
the
pdp
we
promptly
brought
him
to
bill
s
room
to
discus
what
we
need
and
that
be
how
we
found
monte
davidoff
monte
negotiate
a
flat
fee
of
for
his
service
and
several
thousand
more
for

up
work
in
albuquerque
quandary

we
move
into
harvard
s
aiken

oxford
street
a
one

with
an
underutilized
time
share
system
the
clock
be
tick
on
us
from
the
start
bill
have
told
ed
robert
that
our
basic
be
nearly
complete
and
ed
say
he
d
like
to
see
it
in
a
month
or
so
when
in
point
of
fact
we
didn
t
even
have
an
instruction
manual
after
we
bought
one
i
set
to
work
the
have
more
than
twice
as
many
instruction
as
the
which
meant
that
i
d
need
to
create
quite
a
few
more
macro
but
the
two
chip
share
a
basic
architecture
and
my
general
approach
be
the
same
once
again
i
would
be
morph
pdp
software
into
an
assembler
for
the
microprocessor
chip
i
finish
the
macro
in
a
day
or
two
my
simulator
be
large
but
conceptually
similar
to
the
one
for
traf
o
data
and
as
before
i
tweaked
the
pdp
s
debugger
to
allow
us
to
stop
and
peer
inside
our
basic
as
it
ran
there
be
time
in
a
programmer
s
career
when
everything
click
when
your
brain
be
run
full
out
for
me
this
be
one
of
them
i
get
a
boost
from
aiken

do
about

well
as
it
could
have
be
i
m
still
proud
of
that
code
today
if
my

give
us
our
first
big
edge
bill
s
conceptual
talent
as
a
programmer
kept
us
quickly
move
ahead
by
the
time
i
deliver
my
development
suite
he
d
already
thought
through
the
interpreter
s
structure
i
can
still
see
him
alternately
pace
and
rock
for
long
period
before
jotting
on
a
yellow
legal
pad
his
finger
stain
from
a
rainbow
of
felt
tip
pen
once
my
simulator
be
in
place
and
he
be
able
to
use
the
pdp
bill
move
to
a
terminal
and
peer
at
his
legal
pad
as
he
rock
then
he
d
type
a
flurry
of
code
with
those
strange
hand
position
of
his
and
repeat
he
could
go
like
that
for
hour
at
a
stretch
in
building
our
homegrown
basic
we
borrow
bit
and
piece
of
our
design
from
previous
version
a
long
stand
software
tradition
language
evolve
idea
blend
together
in
computer
technology
we
all
stand
on
others
shoulder
as
the
week
pass
we
get
immerse
in
the
mission
as
far
as
we
knew
we
be
building
the
first
native
high
level
program
language
for
a
microprocessor
occasionally
we
wonder
if
some
group
at
mit
or
stanford
might
beat
us
but
we
d
quickly
regain
focus
could
we
pull
it
off
could
we
finish
this
thing
and
close
the
deal
in
albuquerque
yeah
we
could
we
have
the
energy
and
the
skill
and
we
be
hell
bent
on
seize
the
opportunity
we
work
all
hour
with
double
shift
on
weekend
bill
basically
stop
go
to
class
monte
overslept
his
one
o
clock
french
section
i
neglect
my
job
at
honeywell
drag
into
the
office
at
noon
i
d
stay
until
and
then
it
be
back
to
aiken
until
three
or
so
in
the
morning
i
d
save
my
file
crash
for
five
or
six
hour
and
start
over
we
d
break
for
dinner
at
harvard
house
of

or
get
the
pupu

at
aku
aku
a

vic
s
i
have
a
weakness
for
their
egg

and
butterflied
shrimp
i
d
occasionally
catch
bill
grab
nap
at
his
terminal
during
our
late
nighters
he
d
be
in
the
middle
of
a
line
of
code
when
he
d
gradually
tilt
forward
until
his
nose
touch
the
keyboard
after
doze
an
hour
or
two
he
d
open
his
eye
squint
at
the
screen
blink
twice
and
resume
precisely
where
he
d
left
off
a
prodigious
feat
of
concentration
work
so
closely
together
the
three
of
us
developed
a
strong
camaraderie
because
our
program
ran
on
top
of
the
multiuser
top
operating
system
we
could
all
work
simultaneously
we
stag
nightly
competition
to
squeeze
a
subroutine
into
the
few
instruction
take
notepad
to
separate
corner
of
the
room
and
scrawl
away
then
someone
would
say
i
can
do
it
in
nine
and
someone
else
would
call
out
well
i
can
do
it
in
five
at
one
point
after
monte
laid
his
float
point
math
routine
on
the
floor
bill
sprawl
next
to
the
long
tail
of
fan
fold
paper
to
find
a
few
last
trim
we
knew
that
each
byte
save
would
leave
that
much
more
room
for
user
to
add
to
their
application
today
we
live
in
a
different
world
where
sixteen
gigabyte
of
memory
four
million
time
our
basic
budget
for
the
altair
be
packed
into
the
base
iphone
handcraft
code
be
by
and
large
a
lose
art
people
still
try
to
make
program
efficient
but
they
no
longer
fight
to
save
that
last
byte
or
even
megabyte
a
few
year
ago
when
i
reminisce
with
monte
about
those
day
he
compare
program
to
write
a
novel
a
good
analogy
i
thought
for
our
approach
to
altair
basic
at
the
begin
we
outline
our
plot
the
conceptual
phase
of
the
cod
then
we
take
the
big
problem
and
carve
it
into
its
component
chapter
from
the
hundred
of
subroutine
to
their
related
data
structure
before
put
all
the
part
back
together
if
a
line
didn
t
work
we
d
re
edit
our
draft
the
heart
of
the
matter
be
to
sustain
the
big
structural
picture
while
hammer
out
the
detail
of
a
small
subroutine
go
back
and
forth
between
the
two
it
be
the
most
demand
and
stimulate
mental
challenge
i
have
ever
face
as
we
push
on
our
confidence
grow
one
day
we
call
mit
to
ask
about
the
handshake
subroutine
on
the
teletype
for
cod
the
altair
s
input
and
output
we
knew
we
be
on
the
right
track
when
bill
yates
ed
robert
s
partner
and
lead
engineer
told
us
that
no
one
else
have
even
pose
the
question
at
that
point
we
figure
the
job
be
ours
to
lose
return
to
aiken
late
one
night
after
a
fast
food
run
we
be
stop
by
the
campus
police
and
ask
for
our
id
we
d
consider
our
use
of
the
facility
harmless
especially
since
the
pdp
be
underutilized
but
we
didn
t
know
that
harvard
split
the
computer
s
maintenance
cost
with
the
u
s
defense
department
base
on
usage
i
d
rely
on
bill
s
password
account
for
my
work
on
the
simulator
which
ate
a
lot
of
processor
time
when
the
january
bill
come
due
harvard
s
share
be
up
conspicuously
with
one
student
the
prime
culprit
william
henry
gate
iii
when
he
appear
before
the
university
s
administrative
board
that
summer
bill
get
off
with
a
slap
on
the
wrist
by
late
february
eight
week
after
our
first
contact
with
mit
the
interpreter
be
do
shoehorn
into
about
byte
roughly
two
thousand
line
of
code
it
be
one
tight
little
basic
strip
down
for
sure
but
robust
for
its
size
no
one
could
have
beaten
the
functionality
and
speed
crammed
into
that
tiny
footprint
of
memory
the
best
piece
of
work
we
ever
do
as
bill
told
me
recently
and
it
be
a
true
collaboration
i
d
estimate
that
percent
of
the
code
be
bill
s
percent
monte
s
and
percent
mine
exclude
my
development
tool
all
thing
consider
it
be
quite
an
achievement
for
three
people
our
age
if
you
checked
that
software
today
i
believe
it
would
stack
up
against
anything
write
by
our
old
mentor
at
c
cubed
bill
and
i
have
grown
into
crack
programmer
and
we
be
just
get
start
as
i
get
ready
to
go
to
albuquerque
bill
begin
to
worry
what
if
i
d
screw
up
one
of
the
number
use
to
represent
the
instruction
in
the
macro
assembler
our
basic
have
test
out
fine
on
my
simulator
on
the
pdp
but
we
have
no
sure
evidence
that
the
simulator
itself
be
flawless
a
single
character
out
of
place
might
halt
the
program
cold
when
it
ran
on
the
real
chip
the
night
before
my
departure
after
i
knock
off
for
a
few
hour
of
sleep
bill
stayed
up
with
the
manual
and
triple
checked
my
macro
he
be
bleary
eyed
the
next
morning
when
i
stop
by
en
route
to
logan
airport
to
pick
up
the
fresh
paper
tape
he
d
punch
out
the
byte
code
be
correct
bill
say
as
far
as
he
could
tell
my
work
be
error
free
the
flight
be
uneventful
up
until
the
plane
s
final
descent
when
it
hit
me
that
we
d
forgotten
something
a
bootstrap
loader
the
small
sequence
of
instruction
to
tell
the
altair
how
to
read
the
basic
interpreter
and
then
stick
it
into
memory
a
loader
be
a
necessity
for
microprocessor
in
the
pre
rom
era
without
one
that
yellow
tape
in
my
briefcase
would
be
worthless
i
felt
like
an
idiot
for
not
think
of
it
at
aiken
where
i

i
finish
the

one

not
my
most
concise
work
but
i
be
too

i
come
out

ed
robert

suppose
to
pick
me
up
so
i
stood
there
for
ten
minute
look
for
someone
in
a
business
suit
not
far
down
the
entryway
to
the
airport
a
pickup
truck
pull
up
and
a
big
burly
jowly
guy
six
foot
four
maybe
pound
climbed
out
he
have
on
jean
and
a
short
sleeve
shirt
with
a
string
tie
the
first
one
i
d
see
outside
of
a
western
he
come
up
to
me
and
in
a
boom
southern
accent
ask
be
you
paul

his
wavy
black

recede
at

in

as

bounce
over
the
city

i
wonder
how
all
this
be
go
to
turn
out
i
d
expect
a
high
power
executive
from
some
cut

entrepreneurial
firm
like

one

around
boston
the
reality
have
a
whole
different
vibe
on
a
later
trip
to
albuquerque
i
come
down
from
a
plane
and
get
hit
in
the
head
by
tumbleweed
on
the

you

drove
into
a
low
rent
commercial
area
by
the
state
fairground
and
stop
at
a

into

light
industrial
space

house

a
basic

have
little
interest
in

which
he
refer
to
as
variable
hardware
but
he
knew
that
the
altair
s
sale
wouldn
t
keep
expand
unless
it
could
do
something
useful
when
i
arrive
there

only
two
or
three

computer
in
the
whole
plant
everything
else
have
go
out
the
door
ed
lead
me
to
a
messy
workbench
where
i
found
a
sky
blue
metal
box
with
altair
stencil
on
a
charcoal
gray
front
panel
model
after
a
popular
minicomputer
with
row
of
toggle
switch
for
input
and
flash
red
led
for
output
the
altair
look
like
a
slightly
small
version
of
our
traf
o
data
machine
about
seven
inch
high
by
eighteen
inch
wide
it
seem
fantastic
that
such
a
small
box
could
contain
a
general
purpose
computer
with
a
legitimate
cpu
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
altair
be
the
real
mccoy
the
only
mystery
be
whether
it
would
work

how
about

drop
me
at

that

thought
it
be
a
bad
way
to
go
as
he
later
explain
i
thought
everybody
ought
to
own
their
own
computer
and
i
thought
that
for
year
and
year
in
when
i
be
at
c
cubed
ed
found
a
new
company
in
his
garage
mit
for
micro
instrumentation
and
telemetry
system
he
begin
in
the
model
rocket
electronics
business
then
shift
to
handheld
electronic
calculator
kit
when
texas
instrument
kill
the
market
with
cheap
mass
produce
model
and
mit
be
about
to
go
under
ed
turn
to
the
idea
that
have
nag
at
him
since
kirtland
a
real
fully
operational
personal
computer
that
could
do
anything
that
a
general
purpose
minicomputer
of
the
time
could
do
his
ultimate
gadget
as
he
call
it
would
be
a
sensation
if
he
could
pull
it
off
there
be
nothing
close
to
it
on
the
market
like
me
ed
be
follow
the
chip
when
he
get
wind
of
the
microprocessor
he
wangle
some
handwritten
data
sheet
from
an
intel
rep
before
the
release
date
look
at
the
spec
ed
could
see
that
the
microprocessor
be
fast
and
powerful
enough
to
support
the
type
of
computer
he
d
be
talk
about
a
machine
he
could
sell
in
kit
form
for
under

make
a
deal
with
intel
for
a
thousand
chip
at
apiece
a
steep
discount
to
get
a
loan
he
told
his
bank
that
he
could
sell
eight
hundred
machine
in
the
first
year
or
four
time

many
as

stand
out
signing
that

basic

be
a
big
one
for
bill
and
me
now
our
partnership
need
a
name
we
consider
allen
gate
but
it
sound
too
much
like
a
law
firm
my
next
idea
micro
soft
for
microprocessor
and
software
while
the
typography
would
be
in
flux
over
the
next
year
or
so
include
a
brief
transition
as
micro
soft
we
both
knew
instantly
that
the
name
be
right
micro
soft
be
simple
and
straightforward
it
conveyed
just
what
we
be
about
from
the
time
we
d
start
together
in
massachusetts
i
d
assume
that
our
partnership
would
be
a
fifty
fifty
proposition
but
bill
have
another
idea
it
s
not
right
for
you
to
get
half
he
say
you
have
your
salary
at
mit
while
i
do
almost
everything
on
basic
without
one
back
in
boston
i
should
get
more
i
think
it
should
be
sixty
forty
at
first
i
be
take
aback
but
as
i
ponder
it
bill
s
position
didn
t
seem
unreasonable
i
d
be
cod
what
i
could
in
my
spare
time
and
feel
guilty
that
i
couldn
t
do
more
but
bill
have
be
instrumental
in
pack
our
software
with
more
feature
per
byte
of
memory
than
any
other
basic
we
know
as
i
d
write
for
computer
note
all
in
all
i
thought
a
sixty
forty
split
might
be
fair
passing
by
the
mit
load
dock
one
day
i
saw
box
stack
high
with
eight
inch
floppy
disk
drive
the
new
storage
device
recently
introduce
by
ibm
each
one
have
a
capacity
of
k
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
megabyte
which
would
enable
the
altair
to
function
as
a
really
sophisticated
computer
system
as
computer
note
promise
that
july
floppy
disk
drive
be
a
giant
step
toward
a
personal
machine
that
rival
minicomputer
for
functionality
an
k
program
that
take
thirteen
minute
to
load
use
paper
tape
or
five
minute
with
an
audiocassette
need
only
a
few
second
on
a
floppy
but
altair
owner
wouldn
t
be
able
to
use
the
new
drive
until
bill
write
our
stand
alone
disk
basic
so
call
because
of
its
primitive
internal
file
system
and
i
be
get
nervous
as
summer
drew
to
a
close
i
kept
prod
him
to
get
start
bill
it
s
almost
time
for
you
to
go
back
to
school
and
you
haven
t
write
a
single
line
of
code
it
s
ok
i
m
think
about
it
he
d
say
i
ve
get
the
design
in
my
head
then
it
be
bill
you
re
leave
in
ten
day
can
you
really
get
this
do
yeah
i
can
do
it
don
t
worry
about
it
shortly
before
labor
day
bill
checked
into
a
hotel
with
three
legal
pad
and
ten
pencil
five
day
later
he
come
out
with
thousand
of
byte
of
assembly
language
code
he
typed
it
into
a
terminal
hand
me
the
legal
pad
and
say
ok
you
re
gonna
have
to
finish
debug
it
i
ve
get
to
go
then
he
be
off
to
harvard
later
on
as
the
company
grow
and
his
executive
duty
multiply
bill
would
get
few
opportunity
for
such
high
wire
creativity
in
a
way
that
be
too
bad
he
have
a
rare
gift
for

in
september
i

him
at
a

they
imagine
have
to

behind

they
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
such
a
little

could
run
a
real

or
that
you
could
buy
a

for
the

of

but
once
they
saw
it

real
the

become
almost
giddy
with
enthusiasm
mike
won
over
a

that
night
back

i
continued
to
tune
our

and
take
pain
in
write
its

i
love
get
response
like
this
one
from
a
happy
customer
in
washington
state
i
ve
see

use

though
the

for
those
who

press

me
take

project
that

in

convince
his

when

basic
it
be
hard
to
fathom
because
the
machine
be
next
to
worthless
without
it
finally
we
figure
out
why
our
sale
be
so
low
people
have
a
good
reason
not
to
buy
our

many
of
them

from

who
d
invest

still

i
be
short
on

for

so
i

and
grabbed
a
mound
of
change
on
his
dresser
it
be
just
enough
to
spring
him
sometimes
i
wonder
why
bill
drove
so
fast
i
decide
it
be
his
way
of
let
off
steam
he
d
get
so
wound
up
in
our

that
he
need
a
way
to
stop
think
about
the
business
and
the
code
for
a
while
his
breakneck
drive
wasn
t
so
different
from
table
stake
poker
or
edge
of
the
envelope
waterskiing
they
be
all
need
escape
the

here

i
write
home
that
spring
the

but
there
be
always
cool

and
all
the

be
just
start
to
bloom
i
m
sure
dad
would
enjoy
it
but
have
my
parent
see
my
complexion
they
d
have
know
i
wasn
t
get
much
sun
my

so
all
consume
that
the
rest
of
my
life
go
on
hold
and
rita
and
i
cancel
our
plan
for
marriage
at
age
twenty
three
i
just
wasn
t
ready
the
personal
computer
market
be
explode
with
new
machine
emerge
by
the
month
later
that
year
we
make
our
first
sale
to
third
party
manufacturer
data
technology
corporation
national
cash
register
citibank
general
electric
all
be
for
flat
fee
which
lock
us
in
as
the
exclusive
provider
of
basic
for
their
machine
our
strategy
be
to
price
our
product
so
low
that
it
wouldn
t
pay
for
hardware
company
to
develop
their
own
basic
especially
since
it
would
delay
their
entry
into
the
market
to
do
so
but
after
a
sale
to
ge
bill
have
seller
s
remorse
as
he
write
to
me
i
think
we
get
bargain
down
to
a
very
very
low
level
in
the
ge
deal
and
unless
we
get
the
royalty
protection
we
need
in
that
i
don
t
think
it
be
a
good
deal
for
mit
or
us
the
main
idea
be
to
get
a
good
deal
that
doesn
t
require
much
work
for
as
much
money
as
possible
without
be
too
inconsistent
with

a
short

later
we
license

percent
how
much
more
i
be
think
again
i
have
that
moment
of
surprise
but
i
m
a
stubbornly
logical
person
and
i
try
to
consider
bill
s
argument
objectively
his
intellectual
horsepower
have
be
critical
to
basic
and
he
would
be
central
to
our
success
move
forward
that
much
be
obvious
but
how
to
calculate
the
value
of
my
big
idea
the
mating
of
a
high
level
language
with
a
microprocessor
or
my
persistence
in
bring
bill
to
see
it
what
be
my
development
tool
worth
to
the
property
of
the
partnership
or
my
stewardship
of
our
product
line
or
my
day
to
day
brainstorming
with
our
programmer
i
might
have
haggle
and
offer
bill
two
point
instead
of
four
but
my
heart
wasn
t
in
it
so
i
agree
at
least
now
we
can
put
this
to
bed
i
thought
our
formal
partnership
agreement
sign
on
february
have
two
other
provision
of
note
paragraph
allow
an
exemption
from
business
duty
for
a
partner
who
be
a
full
time
student
a
clause
gear
to
the
possibility
that
bill
might
go
back
for
his
degree
and
in
the
event
of
irreconcilable
difference
paragraph
state
that
bill
could
demand
that
i
withdraw
from
the
partnership
later
after
our
relationship
change
i
wonder
how
bill
have
arrive
at
the
number
he
d
propose
that
day
i
try
to
put
myself
in
his
shoe
and
reconstruct
his
think
and
i
conclude
that
it
be
just
this
simple
what
s
the
most
i
can
get
i
think
bill
knew
that
i
would
balk
at
a
two
to
one
split
and
that
percent
be
as
far
as
he
could
go
he
might
have
argue
that
the
number
reflect
our
contribution
but
they
also
expose
the
difference
between
the
son
of
a
librarian
and
the
son
of
a
lawyer
i
d
be
taught
that
a
deal
be
a
deal
and
your
word
be
your
bond
bill
be
more
flexible
in
my
experience
he
believe
that
agreement
be
open
to
renegotiation
until
they
be
sign
and
seal
there
s
a
degree
of
elasticity
in
any
business
deal
a
range
for
what
might
seem
fair
and
bill
push
within
that
range
as
hard
and
as
far
as
he
could
the
momentum
in
personal
computer
shift
for
good

s
an
excerpt
from
my
column
in
personal
compute
circa
january
four
year
before
the
osborne
i
become
the
first
portable
computer
i
expect
the
personal
computer
to
become
the
kind
of
thing
that
people
carry
with
them
a
companion
that
take
note
do
accounting
give
reminder
handle
a
thousand
personal
task
a
few
month
later
in
an
interview
with
microcomputer
interface
i
take
my
train
of
thought
far
fifteen
year
before
the
world
wide
web
i
imagine
a
computerize
society
that
be
far
flung
yet
intimately
link
for
machine
like
the
commodore
pet
that
aren
t
connect
to
any
central
network
i
don
t
see
much
of
a
future
i
don
t
see
the
housewife
really
learn
to
program
in
basic
what
i
do
see
be
a
home
terminal
that
s
connect
to
a
centralize
network
by
phone
line
fiber
optic
or
some
other
communication
system
with
that
system
you
can
perhaps
put
your
car
up
for
sale
or
look
for
a
house
in
a
different
city
or
check
out
the
price
of
asparagus
at
the
near
grocery
market
or
check
the
price
of
a
stock
the
technology
wasn
t
nearly
there
yet
and
i
didn
t
use
the
phrase
in
so
many
word
but
that
be
my
first
public
intimation
of
what
i
d
later
call
the
wire

everything

about

out

in

with
our
cash
flow
dry
up
bill
and
i
prepped
for
our
testimony
with
our
attorney
paull
mine
after
each
session
we
d
race
down
to
the
garage
to
see
who
could
get
back
to
our
office
first
without
a
traffic
ticket
my
monza
be
quick
but
no
match
for
bill
s
porsche
i
have
to
be
crafty
to
beat
him
take
shortcut
through
alleyway
and
parking
lot
and
even
then
i
d
be
hard
press
to
win
one
time
out
of
four
one
day
i
left
a
session
to
get
a
document
from
bill
s
car
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
bill
and
i
look
at
each
other
and
nod
our
signal
that
the
race
be
on
i
tore
out
of
the
garage
and
won
easily
though
i
thought
it
be
strange
that
i
hadn
t
see
the
porsche
the
whole
time
then
i
felt
in
my
pocket
and
found
bill
s
car
key
after
i
return
to
the
law
office
bill
shook
his
head
in
disgust
that
s
the
only
way
you
beat
me
he
say
the
hearing
be
grueling
it
be
disquiet
to
see
pertec
line
up
their
three
lawyer
against
our
one
and
tough
to
watch
ed
testify
against
us
the
arbitrator
s
leaning
seem
to
shift
from
day
to
day
it
gradually
dawn
on
us
that
he
have
little
understand
of
software
a
mostly
untested
arena
for
litigation
after
ten
day
of
testimony
he
take
the
case
under
advisement
with
no
tell
when
we
d
get
a
final
ruling
a
lot
rode
on
the
outcome
if
pertec
won
the
right
to
our
source
code
it
would
mean
the
end
of
microsoft
basic
as
we
knew
it
along
with
the
lion
s
share
of
our
business
we
d
have
to
write
a
new
basic
from
scratch
or
move
on
to
a
different
kind
of
software
our
future
would
be
imperil
meanwhile
the
restrain
order
be
starve
us
as
summer
turn
to
fall
we
struggle
to
make
payroll
and
to
cover
our
rent
and
time
share
expense
it
reach
the
point
where
we
have
to
borrow
from
bob
greenberg
a
harvard
classmate
of
bill
s
whom
we
d
hire
to
write
a
basic
for
a
new
texas
instrument
chip
we
owe
our
lawyer
and
could
be
liable
for
the
cost
of
the
hearing
if
we
lose
the
other
side
figure
they
could
use
their
deeper
pocket
to
outwait
us
and
i
begin
to
wonder
if
they
might
be
right
look
we
re
just
about
out
of
money
i
told
bill
over
dinner
one
night
i
think
we
should
consider
settle
and
bill
say
you
ve
get
to
trust
me
on
this
one
i
talk
to
my
dad
and
he
think
we
ve
get
a
good
chance
to
win
when
press
paull
mine
take
the
same
position
so
i
swallow
hard
and
hung
in
there
and
it
be
the
best
advice
bill
never
take
from
me
in
november
seven
long
month
after
the
process
begin
the
arbitrator
hand
down
a
twelve
page
decision
the
special
clause
in
our
contract
those
paper
that
ed
never
checked
have
make
all
the
difference
the
testimony
be
undisputed
that
mit
never
really
embark
on
what
could
be
consider
best
effort
in
marketing
the
source
code
the
decision
read
by
veto
our
sublicense
sale
mit
pertec
materially
breach
its
best
effort
obligation
i
find
this
an
act
of
corporate
piracy
not
permit
by
either
the
language
or
any
rational
interpretation
of
the

the
ruling
be
a
total
victory
for

our

with

accountable
for
all
unpaid
royalty
most
crucially
bill
and
i
recover
all
right
to
our
basic

and
could
now
sell
it
to
whomever
we
pleased
and
well
yet
keep
all
the

our
one
big
roadblock
be
go
not
long
after
that
ed
robert

after
win
in

we
repaid
bob

with
interest
and
close
our

the
flat
fee
price
tag
on

be
whatever
the

would
bear
because
no
one
knew
for
sure
what
the
personal
computer
would
become
i
flew
to
fort
worth
to
meet
bill
for
a
demo
at
tandy
which
have
take
a
lot
of
heat
for
use
tiny
basic
in
an
initial
manufacturing
run
of
the
trs
we
be
ushered
into
the
sprawl
office
of
john

a
tall
plain
spoken
texan
who
be
en
route
to
become
tandy
s
chairman
and
ceo
he
be
not
a
man
to
be
trifle
with
now
roach
say
in
a
thick
drawl
can
you
boy
really
deliver
a
basic
interpreter
that
work
for
our
computer
we
believe
we
can
bill
say
and
then
he
rattle
off
some
of
our
software
s
outstanding
feature
roach
nod
and
say
and
how
much
be
this
go
to
cost
me
and
bill
say
as
coolly
as
he
could
fifty
thousand
dollar
that
roach
say
flatly
be
the
big
pile
of
horseshit
i
ever
heard
bill
and
i
look
at
each
other
wide
eyed
we
d
heard
a
lot
of
bargaining
tack
but
this
be
something
new
afterward
bill
say
to
me
well
maybe
i
do
ask
for
a
lot
but
horseshit
we
didn
t
back
down
though
and
eventually
get
our
price
i
always
marvel
at
bill
s
bravado
he
d
come
on
superconfident
and
people
like
john
roach
never
knew
how
much
we
fear
lose
the
deal
our
near
disaster
in
arbitration
be
one
more
lesson
for
us
go
forward
we
would
aim
for
maximum
market
share
in
any
sector
we
enter
you
could
never
have
too
many
customer
in
any
event
tandy
do
well
by
our
arrangement
with
our
basic
inside
the

become
the
hottest
sell
computer
in
the

until
roach
get
outflank
by
apple
but
we
be
use
to
the
shift
landscape
of
the

into

when

in
our
early
twenty

steve

once
she
sat
down

intel
introduce
the
one
of
the
first

microprocessor

the
next
evolutionary
step
in
personal

technology
i
be
in

and
have
the

set
well
ahead

it

a

it
be
inevitable
that

that
they

thing
out
in
intense
one
on
one
discussion
he
thrive
on
conflict
and
wasn
t
shy
about
instigate
it
a
few
of
us
cringed
at
the
way
he
d
demean
people
and
force
them
to
defend
their
position
if
what
he
heard
displeased
him
he
d
shake
his
head
and
say
sarcastically
oh
i
suppose
that
mean
we
ll
lose
the
contract
and
then
what
when
someone
ran
late
on
a
job
he
have
a
stock
response
i
could
code
that
in
a
weekend
and
if
you
hadn
t
thought
through
your
position
or
bill
be
just
in
a
lousy
mood
he
d
resort
to
his
classic
put
down
that
s
the
stupidest
fuck
thing
i
ve
ever
heard
good
programmer
take
position
and
stick
to
them
and
it
be
common
to
see
them
square
off
in
some
heat
disagreement
over
cod
architecture
but
it
be
tough
not
to
back
off
against
bill
with
his
intellect
and
foot
tap
and
body
rock
he
come
on
like
a
force
of
nature
the
irony
be
that
bill
like
it
when
someone
push
back
and
drill
down
with
him
to
get
to
the
best
solution
he
wouldn
t
pull
rank
to
end
an
argument
he
want
you
to
overcome
his
skepticism
and
he
respect
those
who
do
even
relatively
passive
people
like
bob
wallace
learn
to
stand
their
ground
and
match
their
bos
decibel
for
decibel
they
d
get
right
into
his
face
what
be
you
say
bill
i
ve
get
to
write
a
compiler
for
a
language
we
ve
never
do
before
and
it
need
a
whole
new
set
of
runtime
routine
and
you
think
i
can
do
it
over
the
weekend
be
you
kid
me
i
saw
this
happen
again
and
again
if
you
make
a
strong
case
and
be
fierce
about
it
and
you
have
the
data
behind
you
bill
would
react
like
a
bluffer
with
a
pair
of
three
he
d
look
down
and
mutter
ok
i
see
what
you
mean
then
try
to
make
up
bill
never
want
to
lose
talented
people
if
this
guy
leaf
he
d
say
to
me
we
ll
lose
all
our
momentum
some
disagreement
come
down
to
bill
and
me
one
on
one
late
at
night
accord
to
one
theory
we
d
instal
real
door
in
all
the
office
to
keep
our
argument
private
if
that
be
the
case
it
didn
t
work
you
could
hear
our
voice
up
and
down
the
eighth
floor
as
longtime
partner
our
dynamic
be
unique
bill
couldn
t
intimidate
me
intellectually
he
knew
i
be
on
top
of
technical
issue
often
well
inform
than
he
because
research
be
my
bailiwick
and
unlike
the
programmer
i
could
challenge
bill
on
broader
strategic
point
i
d
hear
him
out
for
ten
minute
look
him
straight
in
the
eye
and
say
bill
that
doesn
t
make
sense
you
haven
t
consider
x
and
y
and
z
bill
crave
closure
and
he
would
hammer
away
until
he
get
there
on
principle
i
refuse
to
yield
if
i
didn
t
agree
and
so
we
d
go
at
it
for
hour
at
a
stretch
until
i
become
nearly
as
loud
and
wound
up
as
bill
i
hat
that
feel
while
i
wouldn
t
give
in
unless
convince
on
the
merit
i
sometimes
have
to
stop
from
sheer
fatigue
i
remember
one
heat
debate
last
forever
until
i
say
bill
this
isn
t
go
anywhere
i
m
go
home
and
bill
say
you
can
t
stop
now
we
haven
t
agree
on
anything
yet
no
bill
you
don
t
understand
i
m
so
upset
that
i
can
t
speak
anymore
i
need
to
calm
down
i
m
leave
bill
trail
me
out
of
his
office
into
the
corridor
out
to
the
elevator
bank
he
be
still
get
in
the
last
word
but
we
haven
t
resolve
anything
as
the
elevator
door
close
between
us
i
be
mr
slow
burn
like
walter
matthau
to
bill
s
jack
lemmon
when
i
get
mad
i
stayed
mad
for
week
i
don
t
know
if
bill
notice
the
strain
on
me
but
others
do
some
say
bill
s
management
style
be
a
key
ingredient
in
microsoft
s
early
success
but
that
make
no
sense
to
me
why
wouldn
t
it
be
more
effective
to
have
civil
and
rational
discourse
why
do
we
need
knock
down
drag
out
fight
why
not
just
solve
the
problem
logically
and
move
on
with
the
company
en
route
to
its
first
million
dollar
year
and
have
outgrown
the
bank
building
bill
and
i
face
a
decision
stay
or
go
after
three
year
in
new
mexico
i
be
ready
to
move
it
be
hard
to
recruit
top
flight
programmer
to
albuquerque
not
exactly
a
hotbed
of
research
or
technology
after
the
sale
of
mit
to
pertec
there
be
no
real
business
reason
to
stay
on
a
personal
level
there
be
many
thing
to
love
about
albuquerque
the
sunset
the
climate
the
clean
desert
air
but
if
you
grow
up
around
water
and
tree
a
high
desert
city
can
never
feel
completely
like
home
i
miss
the
green
of
the
pacific
northwest
and
i
miss
my
family
too
bill
come
to
my
house
to
discus
our
option
he
be
dead
set
against
move
to
the
bay
area
he
d
see
how
people
in
silicon
valley
change
job
every
year
or
two
which
couldn
t
be
good
for
our
long
term
project
that
left
seattle
because
bill
miss
his
family
too
we
could
fly
out
to
our
bay
area
customer
in
ninety
minute
and
the
rainy
day
be
a
plus
they
d
keep
programmer
from
get
distract
we
agree
to
finish
out
our
lease
and
move
home
at
the
end
of
the
year
which
be
the
story
of
how
seattle
inherit
what
be
now
its
second
large
employer
on
pearl
harbor
day
the
microsoft
staff
convene
on
the
second
floor
of
a
shopping
center
for
a
group
portrait
despite
a
rare
and
rag
snowstorm
in
albuquerque
that
day
eleven
of
thirteen
make
it
to
royal
frontier
studio
ric
weiland
be
house

miriam
lubow
s
husband
told
her
she
d
be
crazy
to
drive
the
three
mile
into
town
miriam
be
the
only
employee
who
wouldn
t
make
the
move
with
us
though
she
d
follow
later
on
when
i
look
at
that
iconic
photograph
today
i
see
a
group
of
young
people
excite
about
their
future
back
in
boston
bill
and
i
have
be
search
for
the
next
big
thing
little
know
that
we
d
find
it
in
this
remote
city
in
the
southwest
now
we
have
a
real
team
behind
us
and
a
firm
sense
of
direction
in
four
year
we
have
come
a
long
way
if
you
look
closely
at
that
photo
you
ll
see
just
about
everyone
smile
that
capture
our
spirit
back
then
when
i
talk
about
the
early
day
at
microsoft
it
s
hard
to
explain
to
people
how
much
fun
it
be
even
with
the
absurd
hour
and
argument
we
be
have
the
time
of
our
life
i
have
to
leave
two
week
before
the
others
to
set
up
the
mainframe
we
d
bought
for
our
software
development
i
scan
the
map
and
saw
that
the
shortest
route
go
through
utah
and
idaho
and
then
into
washington
i
didn
t
bother
to
check
the
forecast
and
it
be
snow
like
the
dickens
by
the
time
i
reach
the
four
corner
area
in
utah
i
be
slide
all
over
the
place
in
my
rear
wheel
drive
monza
at
one
point
i
be
listen
to
earth
wind
fire
when
i
spun
clear
off
the
road
which
scar
the
heck
out
of
me
i
tend
to
be
obstinate
in
adversity
i
put
chain
on
my
tire
by
the
time
i
reach
a
mountainous
stretch
between
utah
and
idaho
call
dead
man
s
pas
the
highway
be
one
solid
sheet
of
ice
i
pass
line
of
semi
that
have
either
skid
off
the
pavement
or
swerve
onto
an
escape
ramp
most
sensible
people
would
have
turn
back
but
i
white
knuckle
it
down
that
mountain
half
sure
that
i
be
go
to
shoot
through
the
guardrail
when
i
finally
reach
seattle
and
it
take
close
to
a
week
i
sent
word
back
that
people
should
take
the
california
route
instead
they
all
have
smooth
sail
except
for
bill
he
reportedly
collect
three
speed
ticket
two
of
them
from
the
same
cop
chapter
softcard
i
bought
my
first
house
in
the
seattle

laser
disc
and
audiocassette
my
sister
move
in
with
me
for
a
while
and
it
felt
as
though
i
be
home
again
i
d
trade
in
my
chevy
monza
for
a
little
black
mazda

day
i
fire
up
our

new
dec
s
small
mainframe
for
microsoft
that
purchase
be
both
a
rite
of
passage
and
a
key
to
boost
our
productivity
no
more
share

with
junior
high
school
no
disruption
when
some
other
operation
monopolize
or
crashed

our
new

our
old
one
in
albuquerque
on
the
eighth
floor
of
a
ten
story
building
own
by
old
national
bank
we
d
expand
from
ten
office
to
maybe
fifteen
with
a
good
size
foyer
for
a
receptionist
but
we
still
have
to
walk
single
file
in
the
corridor
sidle
by
box
stack
with
incoming
hardware
my
office
be
next
to

we
share
a

it

more
machine
than
any
other
single
program
but
we
didn
t
pause
to
celebrate
a
jumble
of
bit
computer
many
of
them
prototype
crowd
a
group
of
table
near
the
programmer
office
i
d
need
to
get
basic
port
onto
each
of
them
to
consolidate
microsoft
s
dominance
in
high
level
language
if
a
hardware
company
use
a
basic
that
wasn
t
ours
we
d
disassemble
it
to
see
if
they
d
reverse
engineer
our
copyright
code
if
our
suspicion
be
confirm
a
stern
letter
or
two
usually
suffice
if
the
code
come
from
another
company
we
d
press
the
point
that
our
basic
be
light
year
well
and
it
be
because
we
d
never
stop
strive
to
add
feature
and
improve
it
convince
that
our
future
lay
in
the
bit
world
i
begin
work
on
a
stand
alone
basic
with
bob
o
rear
an
air
force
veteran
who
become
my
de
facto
deputy
for

we
be
still
work
on
faith
since
the
first
bit
microcomputer
have
yet
to
appear
that
may
i
take
a
call
from
tim
patterson
a
young
designer
at
a
local
hardware
shop
call
seattle
computer
product
scp
he
d
built
a
prototype
computer
with
the
chip
mount
on
a
processor
board
and
be
hunt
for
software
to
test
it
i
told
him
bring
it
on
up
we
ve
get
something
that
might
work
tim
be
an
engineer
after
my
own
heart
someone
who
d
roll
up
his
sleeve
and
dive
into
the
knottiest
problem
after
a
week
of
tinker
both
hardware
and
software
pass
a
run
through
it
be
a
useful
collaboration
that
would
lead
to
a
more
important
alliance
down
the
road
that
early
initiative
be
just
one
example
of
our
try
to
stay
ahead
of
an
ever
accelerate
game
we
constantly
fear
that
someone
might
be
gain
on
us
in
those
early
year
in
seattle
i
have
a
disturb
recurrent
dream
bill
and
i
on
the
flight
deck
of
a
b
struggle
to
get
hold
of
the
plane
while
turbulence
buffet
us
all

beyond
the
commodore
pet
s
the
japanese
market
be
fiercely
competitive
late
one
night

many
of
the

unconventional
with

key

and
a
thought
begin
to
gnaw
at
me
come
off
my
experience
at

believe
that
we
could
build
an
bit
system
superior
to
anyone
else

include
apple
s
and
customize
it
to
run
our
software
kay
be
push
us
to
join
force
with
a
japanese
company
that
would
manufacture
under
the
microsoft
name
he
want
to
approach
sony
which
be
know
for
television
and
audio
speaker
but
have
no
track
record
in

as
kay

it
a
microsoft
sony
computer
would
be
completely
new
and
different
a
true
multimedia
machine
with
state
of
the
art
audio
and

could
some

become
the

that

sell
the

that
be
our
philosophy
too
we
believe
that
software
be
more
valuable
than
hardware
but
we
hadn
t
count
on
someone
outflank
us
with
a
whole
new
approach
to
that

all
that

at

we

excuse
for
put
off

into

software
the

be
competitive
and
highly
fragment
and
bill
and
i
have
decide
that
we
wouldn
t
enter
a

unless
we
knew
we
could
be
number
one
and
with
our

strain
to
fulfill
our
language
contract
it
be
hard
to
see
how
we
could
plunge
into
a
whole
new
sector
still
i
d
have
pang
as
i
watch
wordmaster
evolve
into
wordstar
the
first
widely
accepted
application
of
its
kind
i
knew
in
my
gut
that
word
processing
would
become
a
major
revenue
source
be
we
miss
the
boat
visicalc
be
another
wake
up
call
we
d
license
applesoft
basic
on
a
fix
fee
basis
so
we
have
nothing
to
gain
from
a
spike
in
apple
ii
sale
bad
yet
our
other
language
ran
exclusively
on
cp
m
which
be
incompatible
with
the
microprocessor
use
by
the
apple

the
mo

s
cut
rate
competitor
with

boost
its

geometrically
apple
would
be
position
to
carve
out
a
big
slice
of
a
grow
market
one
microsoft
couldn
t
penetrate
and
we
didn
t
need
to
read
ben
rosen
to
realize
that
people
could
use
the
new
spreadsheet
program
without
our
software
from
the
start
we
d
built
microsoft
around
the
premise
that
our
product
would
be
universal
wherever
the
general
purpose
microcomputer
market
go
we
d
be
there
but
as
personal
compute
mature
from
an
enthusiast
subculture
into
a
mass
medium
i
come
to
see
that
language
would
soon
be
outweigh
by
application
our
mission
could
be
at
risk
unless
we
built
our
own
spreadsheet
and
our
own
word
processor
and
database
as
well
the
altair
have
taught
us
how
quickly
fortune
in
the
tech
world
could
rise
and
fall
as
microsoft
s
technical
leader
i
face
a
more
immediate
bind
how
could
we
get
our
exist
product
onto
the
apple
ii
platform
in
theory
we
could
develop
new
compiler
for
the
apple
in
fortran
cobol
pascal
and
the
rest
but
the
job
would
require
year
of
cod
by
several
programmer
it
would
leave
us
understaffed
in
our
core
business
of
port
basic
to
new
machine
not
to
mention
the
computer
just
around
the
corner
morever
the
apple
work
would
saddle
us
with
a
new
catalog
of
assembly
code
to
debug
and
enhance
a
costly
labor
intensive
proposition
all
told
the
expense
and
distraction
of
full
scale
development
could
cripple
our
still
small
company
it
be
a
dilemma
that
beg
for
an
original
solution
a
few
month
after
see
visicalc
head
to
lunch
in
the
back
of
steve
wood
s
pickup
truck
i
get
one
of
those
idea
that
fortuitously
flash
into
my
head
a
mix
of
inference
and
extrapolation
instead
of
rewrite
our
entire
software
catalog
why
not
turn
the
apple
ii
into
a
compatible
system
if
we
design
an
circuit
board
to
plug
into
the
apple
the
machine
could
run
cp
m
from
a
floppy
disk
and
all
our
language
on
top
of
it
by
import
a
cp
m
friendly
cpu
we
d
avoid
a
massive
recode
project
and
get
into
the
apple
ii
market
at
least
six
month
sooner
in
effect
i
d
turn
a
software
problem
into
a
hardware
problem
an
elegant
shortcut
a
sort
of
hail
mary
pas
at
first
bill
wonder
if
it
might
be
a
distraction
but
he
come
to
agree
that
this
be
one
microsoft
hardware
effort
that
might
be
worth
the
trouble
there
be
two
phase
to
any
invention
the
first
be
the
moment
of
inspiration
the
second
be
the
execution
which
be
less
excite
but
more
than
challenge
in
its
own
right
i
have
no
idea
whether
my
idea
be
actually
doable
i
call
tim
patterson
and
say
can
you
design
this
thing
and
tim
say
i
think
it
s
possible
a
few
week
later
he
come
back
with
a
circuit
board
contain
a
z
chip
a
cheaper
equivalent
to
intel
s
it
be
simple
enough
to
undo
the
plastic
snap
and
pop
the
lid
off
an
apple
ii
then
slide
the
card
into
an
expansion
slot
wire
to
the
cpu
the
native
mo
technology
still
ran
the
apple
s
peripheral
display
keyboard
printer
but
otherwise
go
into
a
state
of
suspend
animation
the
z
softcard
as
we
call
it
take
over
most
of
the
actual
processing
we
d
turn
the
apple
ii
into
something
that
steve
job
wouldn
t
have
imagine
a
cp
m
computer
tim
understood
the
z
well
and
the
card
s
general
design
be
more
than
adequate
but
get
two
processor
to
coexist
be
a
nightmare
the
thing
would
work
fine
for
a
while
but
then
the
native
cpu
would
crash
and
take
our
softcard
with
it
in
march
we
roll
out
the
prototype
at
the
west
coast
computer
faire
in
san
francisco
fret
that
it
would
go
down
at
an
inopportune
moment
i
can
recall
steve
job
passing
by
with
a
scowl
he
have
to
be
irritated
that
we
d
barge
into
his
apple
ii
wall
garden
and
thrown
the
gate
open
to
the
whole
cp

community
to
eradicate
the

gremlin

don
burtis

him

most
of

five
thousand

more
computer
say
paul
allen
microsoft
vice

and
z
softcard
creator
after
hearing
about
the
z
softcard
several
business
people
have
told
us
they
plan
to
bring
home
their

to
run
on
their
home
apple
computer
at
night
that
make
apple

tax

we
bundle
the
softcard
with
diskette
for
cp

and
our
basic
interpreter
and
price
it
at
it

that
fall
to
strong

as
we

it

through
the

nearly
a

go
from

the
trs
it
become
a
hit
on

and
make
a
notable
dent
in
the

my

allow
microsoft
to
share
in
that
success
we
sell
approximately
softcards
in
alone
worth
about
million
in
sale
and
continued
our
strong
run
into
before
imitator
cut
into
our
margin
for
apple
ii
owner
who
d
be
limited
to
a
thin
catalog
of

the

give
them

suddenly
they

for

creator
of
the
popular
peachtree
accounting
which
with
no
development
cost
have
a
new

of
course
our

be
a
boon
to

digital
research
more

would
be

a
hitherto
incompatible

than
for
any
other

for
microsoft
the
softcard
provide
a
point
of
entry
into
the
apple

it
give
us
a
new
and
substantial
customer
base
for
our

basic
and
other

moreover
the
softcard
turn

pricing
strategy
on
its
head
in
the
old

everyone
from
ibm
to
mit
have
bundle

as
a

in
with
the

now
we
be
bundling
a
cheaply
make

to

us
sell

and
our
expensive

be
the

the
softcard
lent
microsoft
a
need
revenue
boost
in
an
awful
recession
year
perhaps
most
important
it
give
us
comfort
in
abandon
the
bit
development
world
and
turn
our
energy
to
software
for
the
chip
a
shift
that
would
prove
critical
in
land
our
big
contract
with
ibm
less
than
a
year
later
as
bill
note
in
a
interview
for
the
smithsonian
the
question
be
should
we
spread
those
product
over
to
other
bit
chip
like
the
that
run
in
the
apple
ii
or
should
we
immediately
move
up
and
do
bit
software
and
i
say
no
we
be
go
to
do
bit
software
everybody
be
a
little
bit
disappointed
because
it
meant
that
we
wouldn
t
be
able
to
sell
onto
these
machine
that
be
when
paul
invent
the
idea
of
the
softcard
so
that
we
could
actually
take
our
intel
software
and
run
it
on
this
machine
and
at
the
same
time
go
ahead
and
devote
our
resource
to
be
way
ahead
of
everybody
else
in
develop
software
for
the
i
have
already
be
institute
the
move
to
bit
software
but
bill
wasn
t
wrong
about
the
softcard
s
importance
under
the
circumstance
i
felt
that
our
partnership
split
be
out
of
whack
bill
have
set
a
precedent
by
claim
extra
equity
for
his
work
on
altair
basic
another
exceptional
contribution
now
it
be
time
i
thought
to
augment
my
share
a
modest
adjustment
in
the
ratio
seem
only
right
but
when
i
make
my
case
bill
would
have
none
of
it
i
don
t
ever
want
to
talk
about
this
again
he
say
do
not
bring
it
up
in
that
moment
something
die
for
me
i
d
thought
that
our
partnership
be
base
on
fairness
but
now
i
saw
that
bill
s
self
interest
overrode
all
other
consideration
my
partner
be
out
to
grab
as
much
of
the
pie
as
possible
and
hold
on
to
it
and
that
be
something
i
could
not
accept
i
didn
t
have
it
out
with
bill
at
the
time
i
suck
it
up
and
thought
ok
but
one
day
i
m
out
of
here
microsoft
now
command
the
cp
m
bit
market
in
program
language
software
and
the
softcard
give
us
a
secure
beachhead
with
apple
but
as
we
grow
our
need
for
more
help
become
glare
neither
bill
nor
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
as
manager
and
both
of
us
have
other
area
of
responsibility
bill
in
sale
i
in
software
development
steve
wood
have
fill
in
admirably
as
general
manager
but
he
too
be
a
programmer
by
background
bill
come
to
see
that
we
need
someone
to
help
him
run
the
business
side
of
thing
just
as
i
ran
technology
he
chose
steve
ballmer
a
harvard
classmate
who
d
work
in
marketing
at
procter
gamble
and
be
now
study
at
stanford
s
business
school
bill
sell
him
hard
to
me
steve
s
a
supersmart
guy
and
he
s
get
load
of
energy
he
ll
help
us
build
the
business
and
i
really
trust
him
i
d
run
into
steve
a
few
time
at
harvard
where
he
and
bill
be
close
the
first
time
we
met
face
to
face
i
thought
this
guy
look
like
an
operative
for
the
nkvd
he
have
pierce
blue
eye
and
a
genuine
toughness
though
as
i
get
to
know
him
well
i
found
a
gentler
side
as
well
steve
be
someone
who
wouldn
t
back
down
easily
a
necessity
for
work
well
with
bill
in
april
shortly
before
leave
town
on
a
business
trip
i
agree
that
we
should
offer
him
up
to
percent
of
the
company
because
bill
felt
certain
that
steve
wouldn
t
leave
stanford
unless
he
get
equity
a
few
day
later
after
return
from
my
trip
i
get
a
copy
of
bill
s
letter
to
steve
someone
apparently
found
it
in
the
office
s
datapoint
word
processing
system
and
it
have
make
the
round
programmer
like
gordon
letwin
be
furious
that
bill
be
give
a
piece
of
the
company
to
a
person
without
a
technical
background
i
be
angry
for
another
reason
bill
have
offer
steve
percent
of
the
company
considerably
more
than
what
i
d
agree
to
it
be
bad
enough
that
bill
have
chosen
to
disregard
me
on
a
partnership
issue
we
d
specifically
discuss
it
be
bad
that
he
wait
till
i
be
away
to
send
the
letter
i
write
him
to
set
out
what
i
have
learn
and
conclude
as
a
result
of
discover
these
fact
i
be
no
longer
interested
in
employ
mr
ballmer
and
i
consider
the
above
point
a
major
breach
of
faith
on
your
part
bill
knew
that
he
d
be
caught
and
couldn
t
bluster
his
way
out
of
it
unable
to
meet
my
eye
he
say
look
we
ve
get
to
have
steve
i
ll
make
up
the
extra
point
from
my
share
i
say
ok
and
that
s
what
he
do
chapter
project
chess
by
have
sell
more
than
half
a
million
copy
our
basic
drew
the
attention
of
the
large
computer
maker
in
the
world
after
ignore
personal
computer
for
year
ibm
have
awoken
to
their
emergence
as
a
platform
for
business
big
blue
knew
that
its
four
year
development
cycle
for
mainframe
wouldn
t
fly
in
the
fast
change
world
of
microcomputer
in
a
sharp
departure
from
company
tradition
it
move
to
outsource
to
company
that
could
help
get
a
new
product
to
market
faster
microsoft
be
about
to
make
the
big
time
that
august
a
three
piece
suit
contingent
lead
by
jack
sam
approach
us
about
project
chess
the
code
name
for
what
would
become
ibm
s
pc
after
we
talk
them
out
of
an
bit
machine
and
won
them
over
to
the
intel
or
as
it
turn
out
the
cheaper
but
virtually
identical
they
want
everything
in
our
bit
cupboard
include
fortran
cobol
and
pascal
aside
from
basic
none
of
these
product
be
even
close
to
be
ready
for
the
platform
it
would
take
a
wild
scramble
to
get
them
all
do
on
ibm
s
tight
timetable
then
in
late
september
sam
ask
us
if
we
could
provide
a
bit
operating
system
we
refer
him
to
digital
research
which
we
d
heard
be
far
along
in
building
one
bill
call
gary
kildall
and
say
i
m
send
some
people
over
to
you
and
i
want
you
to
be
good
to
them
because
you
and
i
be
both
go
to
make
a
lot
of
money
on
this
deal
he
didn
t
mention
ibm
by
name
because
the
company
insist
on
maximum
discretion
and
secrecy
we
d
have
to
sign
a
nondisclosure
agreement
before
they
d
even
sit
down
with
us
as
kildall
himself
later
acknowledge
he
be
off
fly
on
business
when
the
project
chess
group
arrive
his
wife
who
be
also
his
business
partner
refuse
to
sign
the
nondisclosure
and
offer
a
digital
research
document
instead
that
be
something
you
do
not
do
with
ibm
sam
come
back
to
us
and
say
i
don
t
think
we
can
work
with
those
guy
it
would
take
our
legal
department
six
month
to
clear
the
paperwork
do
you
have
any
other
idea
could
you
handle
this
on
your
own
after
the
fact
there
would
be
endless
rumor
about
microsoft
s
dealing
with
digital
research
kildall
theorize
that
ibm
chose
to
work
with
us
because
we
be
willing
to
license
an
operating
system
for
a
flat
fee
while
kildall
insist
on
a
per
copy
royalty
but
i
have
a
front
row
seat
and
this
be
what
happen
we
try
to
do
digital
research
a
favor
and
they
blew
it
they
drop
the
ball
i
vividly
remember
how
furious
bill
be
at
what
have
transpire
he
couldn
t
believe
that
kildall
have
blown
this
golden
chance
and
place
the
whole
project
in
jeopardy
bill
call
an
emergency
meeting
with
me
and
kay
nishi
what
could
we
do
to
resuscitate
the
deal
there
be
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
i
say
there
s
another
operating
system
that
might
work
i
don
t
know
how
good
it
be
but
i
think
i
can
get
it
for
a
reasonable
price
i
told
them
the
story
of
tim
patterson
and
seattle
computer
product
which
begin
shipping
its
machine
earlier
that
year
but
have
found
sparse
commercial
interest
the
miss
link
be
an
operating
system
kildall
have
promise
a
cp
m
by
the
first
of
the
year
but
he
hadn
t
deliver
his
company
lack
the
typical
start
up
s
urgency
no
one
knew
when
his
bit
software
would
make
it
to
market
tim
patterson
have
gotten
frustrate
wait
our
basic
be
fine
for
write
program
but
his
customer
couldn
t
run
a
word
processor
or
other
application
on
top
of
it
so
tim
have
cobble
together
a
provisional
bit
operating
system
to
help
his
company
sell
a
few
computer
until
kildall
come
through
as
tim
later
say
we
would
have
be
perfectly
happy
have
somebody
else
do
the
operating
system
if
digital
research
have
deliver
in
december
of
there
wouldn
t
be
anything
but
cp
m
in
this
world
today
he
call
the
program
qdos
for
quick
and
dirty
operating
system
which
he
d
manage
to
cram
into
k
of
code
once
it
be
mostly
do
he
change
the
name
to
do
tim
have
make
strong
stride
with
his
software
and
i
felt
confident
in
tell
bill
and
kay
that
it
would
probably
work
though
we
d
still
need
to
finish
and
adapt
it
for
the
ibm
pc
do
would
give
us
a
run
start
at
least
we
d
have
a
shot
after
i
finish
kay
cut
in
we
ve
get
to
do
it
he
kept
shout
sell
our
basic
in
japan
he
d
see
firsthand
the
enormous
interest
in
cp
m
from
computer
hardware
firm
if
microsoft
be
to
govern
its
future
we
have
to
have
our
own
operating
system
i
agree
ever
since
altair
basic
our
objective
have
be
to
establish
standard
and
then
to
license
our
program
throughout
the
industry
now
thanks
to
a
fluke
we
d
be
hand
the
opportunity
to
create
the
pivotal
product
of
the
era
with
ibm
s
unmatched
power
and
reach
we
might
even
be
able
to
unify
the
microcomputer
software
market
as
a
bonus
as
kay
point
out
a
bit
microsoft
operating
system
would
dovetail
neatly
with
our
language
development
business
bill
be
less
enthusiastic
he
didn
t
know
tim
patterson
and
we
d
be
bet
our
deal
with
ibm
the
most
critical
one
we
d
ever
have
on
an
unknown
quantity
once
call
quick
and
dirty
but
bill
realize
that
we
might
lose
the
whole
contract
unless
we
come
up
with
something
and
he
go
along
i
call
rod
brock
who
own
seattle
computer
product
to
work
out
a
licensing
agreement
we
settle
on
plus
a
royalty
of
for
every
company
that
license
the
software
a
total
of
for
now
as
we
have
only
one
customer
the
next
day
a
microsoft
delegation
bill
steve
and
bob
o
rear
met
with
ibm
in
boca
raton
and
propose
that
microsoft
coordinate
the
overall
software
development
process
for
the
pc
five
week
later
the
contract
be
sign
ibm
would
pay
us
a
total
of
for
adaptation
test
and
consultation
for
the
disk
operating
system
do
and
for
an
array
of
bit
language
interpreter
and
compiler
bill
and
i
be
willing
to
forgo
per
copy
royalty
if
we
could
freely
license
the
do
software
to
other
manufacturer
our
old
strategy
for
altair
basic
already
enmesh
in
antitrust
litigation
ibm
readily
bought
this
nonexclusive
arrangement
they
d
later
be
slam
for
give
away
the
store
but
few
people
at
the
time
discern
how
quickly
the
industry
be
change
and
no
one
include
us
foresaw
that
the
ibm
deal
would
ultimately
make
microsoft
the
large
tech
company
of
its
day
or
that
bill
and
i
would
become
wealthy
beyond
our
imagine
as
i
look
back
at
my
life
i
d
propose
that
my
success
be
the
product
of
preparation
and
hard
work
yes
i
be
lucky
to
get
early
program
opportunity
in
high
school
and
at
c
cubed
to
have
a
father
with
the
key
to
a
major
library
system
to
find
a
partner
in
bill
who
could
take
my
idea
and
magnify
them
to
cross
path
with
ed
robert
who
need
to
buy
what
we
be
able
to
build
just
at
the
right
time
but
it
be
no
accident
that
i
be
position
to
take
advantage
of
those
break
ibm
come
to
microsoft
in
the
first
place
because
we
have
push
the
frontier
for
microcomputer
language
with
more
prescience
and
boldness
than
anyone
else
i
have
tie
to
tim
patterson
because
i
d
hustle
to
develop
an
basic
and
later
hire
tim
to
take
a
first

what
might
come
next
and
want
to
try
to
make
it
happen
from
my

never

in

few
journal
article
divulge
some
of
parc
s
innovation
even
before
we
move
back
to
seattle
i
be
put
a
bug
in
bill
s
ear
about
the
graphical
user
interface
know
as
gui
pronounce
gooey
a
computer
experience
that
go
beyond
conventional
type
and
character
base
display
to
new
mode
of
interactivity
link
to
a
mouse
a
gui
would
allow
ordinary
people
to
use
computer
intuitively
its
potential
impact
on
our
market
couldn
t
be
overestimate
microsoft
be
preoccupy
with
project
chess
but
i
knew
that
we
d
need
a
gui
and
gui
application
in
our
arsenal
before
long
whenever
i
show
bill
material
like
alto
a
personal
computer
a
technical
report
publish
by
xerox
in
he
respond
as
he
have
to
my
pre
altair
excitement
over
the
chip
it
look
intrigue
he
say
but
who
s
go
to
build
the
hardware
and
sell
it
at
a
price
that
work
the
alto
be
a
research
prototype
that
address
a
bold
question
what
could
you
create
if
you
trust
moore
s
law
and
reimagined
the
state
of
the
art
with
no
cost
constraint
but
the
machine
be
far
too
pricey
for
the
home
market
for
a
pragmatist
like
bill
the
whole
idea
must
have
seem
premature
his
view
begin
to
change
in
september
when
charles
simonyi
one
of
parc
s
lead
programmer
come
in
for
a
job
interview
bill
be
tie
up
when
he
arrive
and
steve
ballmer
sent
him
to
me
a
soft
spoken
man
with
a
mild
hungarian
accent
charles
have
grown
restless
with
pure
research
and
want
to
move
into
product
development
he
knew
us
as
the
language
company
and
brought
some
idea
in
that
area
but
i
be
more
interested
in
the
work
he
d
be
do
at
parc
i
page
through
his
portfolio
and
it
blew
me
away
two
month
earlier
in
a
strategy
memo
for
microsoft
r
d
i
d
push
for
development
of
a
word
processor
which
stand
above
the
rest
in
term
of
feature
ease
of
use
and
adaptability
now
i
be
hold
that
very
thing
or
at
least
a
fair
description
of
it
in
my
hand
charles
have
lead
the
development
team
for
bravo
the
first
wysiwyg
what
you
see
be
what
you
get
word
processing
software
to
feature
proportional
font
unlike
predecessor
like
wordstar
bravo
present
text
on
the
screen
exactly
as
it
would
appear
on
the
print
page
while
i
didn
t
grasp
all
of
the
technical
detail
at
first
it
be
plain
that
i
be
look
at
the
future
of
word
processing
software
and
at
the
person
who
could
guide
us
there
charles
come
back
a
second
time
after
meeting
with
top
xerox
executive
who
want
very
much
to
keep
him
we
must
have
say
something
right
because
he
decide
to
throw
in
with
us
instead
the
contrast
couldn
t
have
be
sharper
he
d
say
later
xerox
be
an
old
company
in
an
old
industry
go
downhill
walk
in
the
dark
it
s
not
that
they
didn
t
know
the
answer
that
s
normal
but
they
didn
t
know
the
question
charles
s
decision
shock
his
parc
colleague
who
couldn
t
believe
he
be
move
to
such
an
obscure
software
operation
six
year
later
the
two
company
market
value
would
cross
as
of
late
xerox
be
worth
billion
or
about
percent
as
much
as
microsoft
later
that
fall
before
his
deal
with
us
be
finalize
charles
invite
me
to
his
lab
in
palo
alto
for
a
demonstration
as
he
sat
before
an
alto
and
put
it
through
its
pace
i
be
amaze
it
be
one
thing
to
read
about
a
true
breakthrough
something
else
to
see
it
in
action
now
i
knew
how
people
must
have
felt
at
engelbart
s
mother
of
all
demo
in
as
though
beam
by
transporter
into
the
future
the
alto
wasn
t
technically
a
microcomputer
because
it
didn
t
use
a
microprocessor
but
it
be
compact
for
its
time
with
the
cabinet
hold
the
cpu
and
hard
drive
be
the
size
of
a
dorm
room
refrigerator
the
desktop
unit
consist
of
a
keyboard
and
an
integrate
monitor
proportion
like
a
sheet
of
standard
copy
paper
taller
than
it
be
wide
where
commercial
computer
of
the
day
offer
low
resolution
display
of
white
or
green
or
amber
character
on
a
black
screen
the
alto
have
be
rethought
from
the
ground
up
as
charles
typed
on
the
black
on
white
bitmapped
display
i
saw
for
the
first
time
everything
we
take
for
grant
in
today
s
word
processor
bold
and
italic
and
underlined
font
of
different
size
curve
line
and
justified
text
i
watch
transfixed
as
charles
cut
and
paste
section
of
his
document
xerox
parc
have
not
oversold
the
alto
it
do
indeed
replicate
the
flexibility
of
pen
and
ink
but
with
digital
ease
and
speed
to
the
side
of
the
keyboard
charles
roll
a
rectangular
box
with
three
button
in
a
horizontal
row
a
mechanical
mouse
when
he
move
aside
i
sat
down
for
a
turn
it
take
a
few
moment
to
coordinate
the
movement
of
my
hand
with
the
position
of
a
cursor
on
a
screen
but
soon
the
mouse
felt
like
an
extension
of
my
arm
and
it
be
then
that
i
realize
how
a
gui
interface
could
make
people
so
much
more
productive
charles
take
over
again
and
drag
an
icon
represent
a
document
file
to
a
printer
icon
a
laser
printer
know
as
the
dover
hum
into
action
at
the
time
dot
matrix
and
daisywheel
printer
be
the
bane
of
personal
computer
user
slow
loud
and
prone
to
jamming
with
just
one
standard
font
but
in
the
magical
world
of
xerox
parc
i
have
within
second
a
perfect
copy
of
the
memo
that
summarize
our
meeting
with
charles
in
seattle
what
be
our
business
produce
and
sell
software
for
micro
mini
system
on
the
mass
market
the
printer
be
the
one
parc
brainchild
that
xerox
a
copier
company
at
heart
would
successfully
bring
to
market
a
single
dover
cost
about
charles
say
but
we
both
knew
the
price
would
soon
plunge
charles
drew
my
attention
to
a
yellow
cable
run
out
the
back
of
the
machine
an
umbilical
cord
to
a
local
area
network
that
connect
several
alto
use
ethernet
yet
another
patent
parc
technology
this
nexus
of
personal
computer
have
all
the
benefit
of
old
style
time
share
a
common
printer
and
a
file
server
for
additional
storage
but
none
of
the
drawback
slow
connection
cripple
networkwide
crash
wow
i
thought
this
be
go
to
change
everything
parc
s
achievement
seem
both
startle
and
commonsensical
surely
people
would
want
what
i
d
see
and
touch
at
charles
s
lab
of
course
you
should
be
able
to
interact
with
a
computer
with
a
point
device
or
drag
a
file
to
a
different
folder
or
push
a
button
to
print
what
look
like
a
page
from
a
book
that
afternoon
in
palo
alto
be
a
thunderclap
once
gui
go
commercial
computer
would
become
so
natural
and
organic
that
anyone
s
mother
would
learn
how
to
use
them
at
that
point
it
seem
to
me
nothing
could
stop
their
universal
adoption
they
d
be
like
television
set
they
d
be
irresistible
project
chess
be
so
hush
hush
that
even
industry
insider
have
no
clue
what
we
be
do
when
i
mention
it
to
charles
after
he
start
work
for
us
around
the
new
year
he
thought
it
be
one
of
vern
raburn
s
consumer
game
product
and
wasn
t
impressed
we
ve
get
to
focus
he
say
then
i
told
him
about
ibm
s
move
into
the
personal
computer
market
that
be
a
different
story
charles
agree
we
be
so
tight
lipped
that
we
wouldn
t
even
mention
the
famous
corporate
acronym
by
name
we
refer
to
our
customer
as
hal
after
the
computer
in
a
space
odyssey
as

ibm

one
letter
down
the
alphabet
new
level
of
security
be
need
when
the
pc
prototype
arrive
at
our
office
around
thanksgiving
it
be
closet
in
a
small
windowless
backroom
under
strict
lock
and
key
access
be
limited
to
a
handful
of
people
a
third
of
our
staff
work
on
some
aspect
of
project
chess
but
the
central
development
unfolded
in
this
airless
ten
by
fifteen
foot
space
my
direct
responsibility
be
basic
to
conserve
the
pc
s
limited
memory
ibm
have
direct
us
to
embed
basic
in
the
machine
s
rom
though
we
d
do
this
earlier
with
applesoft
basic
i
be
nervous
as
hell
about
it
the
only
way
to
fix
a
faulty
rom
chip
be
by
recall
the
machine
and
what
if
our
new
basic
have
bug
i
knew
that
you
didn
t
release
complex
first
generation
software
and
have
it
bang
on
by
hundred
of
thousand
of
user
without
something
bad
turn
up
i
hit
upon
a
novel
solution
to
insert
a
hundred
or
more
cod
hook
so
that
any
part
of
the
basic
code
could
be
patch
or
update
from
a
floppy
disk
for
an
analogy
think
of
open
envelope
taped
to
key
section
of
a
book
allow
new
material
or
correction
to
be
insert
without
reprint
the
entire

those

out
to
be
lifesaver
to
make
sure
that
do

pas

i
chose
the

in
our
bermuda

in
an

against

which
could
be
disconcert
we
be
work
on
a
crash
schedule
with
a
client
who
be
famously
intolerant
of
slip
deadline
we
d
overnight
floppy

with
each
day
s
progress
to
ibm
in
boca
raton
where
the

test
if
some

make
a
day
unproductive
one
of
our
programmer
unbeknownst
to
me
would
accidentally
reformat
the

before
shipping
when
ibm
call
to
complain
that
they
d
gotten
a
blank

he
d
apologize
for
the
error
and
correct
it
in
the
next

buying
time
one
big
problem
be
the
flaky
ibm
prototype
bob
kept
resoldering
loose

but
it
could
be
hard
to
trace
the

of
the
defect
hardware
or
software
precious
day
be
lose
more
delay
come
from
ibm
s
fastidious
test
protocol
and
bob
spent
a
discourage
amount
of
time
fill
out
corporate
form
we
joked
that
ibm
s
slogan
should
have
be
well
product
through
well
paperwork
the
original
mid
january
deadline
to
have
do
and
basic
work
come
and
go
and
we
begin
to
worry
that
ibm
might
pull
the
plug
if
they
couldn
t
make
their
schedule
august
rollout
rumor
have
it
that
a
parallel
workgroup
in
japan
stood
ready
to
replace
us
if
we
falter
on
january
bob
express
our
concern
in
write
to
an
ibm
manager
name
pat
harrington
microsoft
be
continue
its
effort
to
bring
up
do
and
basic
on
the
prototype
hardware
but
due
to
problem
with
both
hardware
and
software
provide
by
ibm
we
have
yet
to
be
successful
these
problem
have
left
us
several
week
behind
schedule
six
night
later
bob
get
the
software
up
and
run
he
broke
the
news
to
me
the
follow
morning
and
i
d
never
felt
so
relieve
we
still
have
bug
to
address
and
the
ibm
printer
they
sent
us
didn
t
work
but
we
knew
that
we
be
on
our
way
on
may
tim
patterson
left
scp
to
come
to
work
for
us
he
be
a
critical
reinforcement
because
he
knew
do
inside
and
out
late
that
spring
bill
and
kay
nishi
make
another
trip
to
japan
for
a
solid
week
they
be
besiege
by
japanese
computer
maker
clamor
for
a
bit
operating
system
despite
a
leak
in
one
of
the
trade
magazine
project
chess
remain
top
secret
and
bill
couldn
t
say
a
word
about
the
do
we
be
develop
in
seattle
even
so
that
trip
be
tell
microsoft
s
big
plum
it
become
apparent
wasn
t
the
version
we
d
make
specifically
for
ibm
pc
the
real
bonanza
be
the
compatible
system
that
we
d
call
m
do
the
product
that
could
be
sell
over
and
over
again
worldwide
under
our
own
name
to
company
that
would
follow
ibm
s
fly
wedge
into
the
bit
market
between
the
interest
in
japan
and
ibm
s
domestic
ripple
effect
we
begin
to
realize
that
m
do
would
be
the
international
centerpiece
of
personal
computer
technology
so
it
be
crucial
for
us
to
gain
as
much
control
over
do
as
we
could
in
june
i
return
to
seattle
computer
product
to
try
to
modify
our
deal
for
do
offering
a
flat
fee
of
for
any
future
licensing
rod
brock
counter
by
ask
for
for
an
exclusive
license
i
upped
our
offer
to
for
exclusive
right
and
then
propose
an
outright
purchase
throw
in
favorable
term
on
subsequent
upgrade
of
our
bit
language
that
be
the
sale
agreement
that
brock
and
i
sign
on
july
a
contract
that
laid
the
foundation
for
what
microsoft
would
become
i
knew
it
be
a
coup
and
that
a
free
and
clear
do
would
be
a
valuable
asset
but
i
cannot
say
that
we
knew
just
how
valuable
it
would
be
as
i
state
in
a
deposition
sometime
later
bill
be
very
adamant
that
we
should
make
the
contract
an
agreement
of
sale
bill
thought
we
should
have
complete
ownership
and
control
of
the
product
he
felt
it
be
always
well
if
you
want
to
control
and
benefit
from
the
evolution
of
a
product
to
own
it
as
compare
to
license
it
he
say
it
would
just
make
everything
cleaner
if
brock
have
know
about
ibm
he
undoubtedly
would
have
held
out
for
more
and
we
certainly
would
have
upped
our
offer
but
he
be
happy
to
sell
he
d
be
hit
hard
by
the
recession
and
need
cash
and
no
one
twist
his
arm
brock
s
priority
be
to
increase
his
hardware
sale
by
bundling
a
reliable
operating
system
with
his
new
computer
scp
wasn
t
equip
to
partner
with
ibm
as
the
industry
move
into
the
next
era
of
personal
computer
that
be
never
in
the
card
five
year
after
the
pc
s
rollout
brock
fell
on
hard
time
and
sue
microsoft
in
an
attempt
to
regain
control
over
the
operating
system
that
he
d
sell
us
give
the
uncertainty
of
a
jury
trial
microsoft
settle
ibm
s
personal
computer
be
announce
on
august
and
ship
ahead
of
schedule
in
november
everyone
expect
the
pc
to
do
well
but
no
one
have
anticipate
that
it
would
rule
the
pc
market
so
quickly
within
four
year
with
apple
s
machine
the
sole
exception
any
microcomputer
that
be
incompatible
with
the
pc
and
m
do
standard
would
be
irrelevant
i
be
proud
of
our
team
of
course
m
do
quickly
become
the
cornerstone
of
the
company
s
success
and
it
be
deeply
satisfy
to
have
played
a
central
role
in
its
delivery
to
market
but
i
be
equally
proud
of
basic
our
old
warhorse
now
run
on
a
new
processor
chip
while
i
d
tweaked
and
improve
the
vintage
code
that
we
d
originally
handcraft
for
the
altair
it
survive
mostly
intact
in
the
pc
it
still
have
some
gas
left
in
the
tank
after
all
as
microsoft
grow
to
nearly
a
hundred
employee
we
knew
we
have
to
follow
the
silicon
valley
model
and
share
some
equity
to
keep
our
top
people
we
weren
t
yet
ready
to
take
on
the
complication
of
a
public
offering
as
apple
have
in
but
it
be
time
to
incorporate
we
strengthen
our
board
of
director
by
bring
in
david
marquardt
a
young
venture
capitalist
who
would
ease
our
entr

into
the
financial
market
in
june
we
file
our
paper
with
the
state
of
washington
with
the
pie
cut
into
more

our
stake
be
slightly
dilute
under
the
new
ownership
split
bill
kept
percent
of
the
equity
and
i
retain

the

didn
t
immediately
change
anything
but
it
make
our
business
feel
more
serious
that
fall
we
move
into
a
large
space
near
lake
washington
and
burgermaster
a
fast
food
favorite

and
i
take
adjacent
office
with
a

secretary
and
a
short
passageway
between
us
i
could
hear
his
every
shout
match
include
the
battle
royal
with
steve
ballmer
steve
complement
bill
as
a
sound
board
on
business
strategy
as
i
do
on
technical
strategy
bill
remain
the
big
picture
tactician
but
steve
make
us
more
discipline
and
systematic
the
two
of
them
could
get
adversarial
at
time
with
steve
s
arm
wave
histrionics
feed
into
bill
s
pitiless
dissection
of
what
he
thought
everyone
else
be
do
wrong
they
be
both
ultracompetitive
super
high
iq
maniacally
relentless
people
with
a
tendency
toward
melodrama
over
time
their
disagreement
seem
to
get
more
frequent
and
intense
like
face
offs
between
bull
elephant
especially
when
steve
try
to
push
bill
to
ramp
up
hire
the
only
way
to
keep
our
customer
and
sustain
microsoft
s
growth
not
long
after
come
on
board
he
told
bill
that
microsoft
need
another
thirty
people
right
away
double
our
staff
i
be
all
for
it
but
bill
consider
it
heretical
he
like
to
take
on
overhead
slowly
and
incrementally
which
could
miss
the
boat
in
the
tech
industry
he
start
yell
at
steve
do
you
know
what
you
re
do
when
you
ask
for
thirty
people
be
you
try
to
bankrupt
this
company
steve
bellow
back
we
don
t
have
a
choice
we
ve
get
commitment
and
delivery
date
if
we
don
t
make
these
hire
we
ll
blow
the
contract
and
bill
say
what
if
the
business
slows
down
while
we
re
pay
all
these
people
we
ll
be
wipe
out
be
you
crazy
we
could
destroy
this
company
do
you
want
to
destroy
us
i
give
steve
credit
for
not
backing
down
he
kept
work
bill
over
until
he
get
what
we
need
after
an
hour
of
back
and
forth
he
say
that
s
ok
bill
it
s
on
me
damn
it
but
we
ve
get
to
get
those
people
in
here
or
we
re
screw
steve
be
sincere
and
straightforward
theatrical
maybe
but
not
manipulative
we
didn
t
always
agree
about
the
business
but
we
generally
stayed
out
of
each
other
s
way
sometimes
we
d
go
on
recruitment
trip
and
share
a
twin
room
in
the
frugal
microsoft
tradition
one
morning
i
awoke
to
a
series
of
grunt
i
crack
my
eye
open
to
find
steve
do
push
ups
by
the
dozen
at
seven
in
the
morning
i
thought
this
guy
be
really
hardcore
typically
we
d
tour
the
top
computer
science
school
at
the
best
university
mit
cal
tech
harvard
yale
stanford
i
can
recall
a
packed
lounge
at
mit
where
student
be
chant
the
actor
line
in
unison
during
a
star
trek
rerun
bill
thought
it
be
well
to
get
programmer
when
they
be
young
and
enthusiastic
before
they
be
ruin
by
work
somewhere
else
after
my
stint
at
honeywell
i
couldn
t
disagree
we
want
freshly
mint
bachelor
s
degree
occasionally
a
master
s
rarely
a
phd
above
all
we
be
after
the
brightest
light
a
great
programmer
can
outproduce
an
average
one
by
ten
to
one
with
a
genius
the
ratio
might
be
fifty
to
one
fortunately
with
its
water
and
nearby
mountain
and
urbanized
core
seattle
be
an
easy
sell
than
albuquerque
and
once
ibm
announce
the
pc
anyone
could
see
that
we
be
offering
unparalleled
opportunity
we
might
pay
slightly
under
the
norm
but
our
pitch
be
persuasive
would
you
rather
work
on
some
process
control
project
for
dow
chemical
or
a
state
of
the
art
word
processor
for
the
ibm
pc
an
ambitious
young
software
engineer
wouldn
t
think
twice
about
join
us
steve
s
effort
finally
get
microsoft
grow
in
line
with
its
revenue
from
employee
in
to
in
and
in
when
a
company
double
or
triple
in
size
each
year
it
can
t
possibly
stay
tight
knit

i
still
hung
out
with
people
from
work

for
dinner

the

postscript

the

we
idolize

resist
the

as
its

told
the

there
be
no

anyone

with

it
flop
in
the

dec
have
achieve
small
miracle
by
march
to
its
own
drummer
if
ten
year
earlier
you
have
told
us
that
ibm
would
forge
a
new
path
for
microcomputer
and
that
the
maker
of
the
pdp
would
straggle
in
late
and
be
unable
to
adapt
we
would
never
have
believe
you
as
ibm
pc
sale
explode
the
national
medium
take
notice
of
microsoft
and
particularly
of
bill
as
its
president
he
become
the
face
of
our
company
and
the
logical
source
for
any
journalist
which
be
fine
with
me
i
ll
do
my
share
of
publicity
but
i
don
t
seek
it
out
my
recently
open
twitter
account
notwithstanding
one
thing
didn
t
change
bill
be
as
headstrong
as
ever
once
i
flew
with
him
to
san
francisco
to
visit
a
few
customer
for
efficiency
s
sake
we
conduct
separate
meeting
before
rendezvous
back
at
the
airport
i
reach
the
gate
several
minute
before
takeoff
but
bill
be
late
as
usual
they
issue
the
final
boarding
call
no
bill
i
be
resign
to
find
the
next
flight
when
he
rush
up
to
the
gate
out
of
breath
it
be
too
late
the
plane
be
already
inch
away
from
the
jetway
but
bill
never
stop
run
through
the
boarding
gate
and
into
the
jetway
itself
with
me
trail
upon
reach
the
motor
control
panel
he
do
a
quick
scan
and
begin
push
button
then
i
realize
what
be
happen
bill
be
try
to
move
the
jetway
back
up
to
the
plane
so
we
could
board
aghast
i
call
out
don
t
do
that
an
airline
agent
rush
over
i
be
sure
that
we
would
both
be
arrest
or
at
the
very
least
escort
from
the
terminal
but
the
man
say
sir
sir
hold
on
we
ll
get
the
plane
to
come
back
to
my
astonishment
that
be
exactly
what
happen
they
return
the
plane
allow
us
to
board
and
we
get
home
on
time
in
general
i
have
less
to
do
than
ever
with
the
business
side
of
microsoft
with
steve
ballmer
on
board
i
be
free
to
anchor
our
technical
work
my
management
style
be
to
wander
the
hall
and
peek
in
on
the
programmer
what
problem
be
slow
you
down
have
you
thought
about
try
it
this
way
what
happens
if
i
pull
the
disk
out
when
you
re
do
that
we
d
talk
for
a
few
minute
as
i
probed
one
of
my
strong
suit
then
i
d
let
them
solve
the
rest
of
the
problem
themselves
unless
someone
hit
a
roadblock
and
get
stuck
when
i
d
drill
down
to
help
get
thing
move
again
the
programmer
like
have
one
of
their
own
in
a
decision
make
position
and
i
m
sure
it
be
a
relief
to
report
to
someone
with
a
technical
background
often
i
d
get
valuable
information
about
some
unexpected
problem
they
d
be
loath
to
tell
bill
for
fear
of
get
yell
at
but
they
felt
more
relaxed
with
me
i
love
work
with
my
guy
and
i
think
they
knew
it
but
though
my
role
may
have
narrow
bill
kept
run
big
decision
by
me
our
dynamic
be
more
intertwine
than
the
partnership
at
apple
where
steve
job
be
the
grand
thinker
and
steve
wozniak
the
crack
hardware
designer
bill
and
i
be
both
generalist
at
heart
that
be
a
big
strength
for
microsoft
but
it
also
meant
that
no
subject
escape
debate
back
in
february
after
i
d
grown
convince
that
we
need
a
more
powerful
operating
system
we
license
at
t
s
unix
software
and
rename
it
xenix
to
abide
by
trademark
restriction
our
goal
be
to
find
a
niche
among
midsize
company
that
want
a
heavier
duty
system
than
m
do
without
pay
for
a
minicomputer
or
use
a
time
share
service
but
while
xenix
make
some
money
for
microsoft
it
fell
short
of
expectation
even
a
scale
down
version
of
unix
be
too
demand
for
the
chip
and
there
be
financial
issue
too
at
t
be
unwilling
to
low
its
license
fee
for
high
volume
sale
so
their
royalty
cut
deeply
into
our
profit
margin
microsoft
wound
up
sell
its
interest
in
the
software
a
few
year
later
xenix
be
still
on
my
mind
in
the
spring
of
when
ibm
ask
us
for
a
next
generation
do
that
could
manage
the
upcoming
pc
xt
and
its
megabyte
hard
disk
drive
a
vast
amount
of
storage
at
the
time
it
s
about
enough
for
three
uncompressed
digital
photo
today
by
that
point
do
be
like
a
one
story
one
bedroom
house
it
kept
the
rain
out
but
it
sorely
need
remodel
i
assign
do
to
three
of
my
sharpest
developer
mark
zbikowski
the
group
leader
aaron
reynolds
and
chris
peter
our
goal
be
to
bring
several
best
of
breed
unix
feature
into
the
pc
and
to
widen
our
edge
over
digital
research
and
apple
whose
operating
system
be
less
sophisticated
if
we
do
the
job
right
it
would
bolster
m
do
as
the
industry
standard
after
brainstorming
for
day
on
possible
improvement
we
settle
on
two
major
one
the
first
be
mark
s
idea
for
loadable
device
driver
which
would
allow
pc
user
to
add
third
party
printer
or
external
hard
drive
without
soak
up
too
much
memory
the
driver
would
be
load
from
the
pc
s
hard
drive
only
when
the
peripheral
be
actually
add
to
the
system
a
first
step
toward
today
s
plug
and
play
second
and
more
important
we
be
devise
a
new
way
to
organize
file
for
stand
alone
basic
bill
and
marc
mcdonald
have
design
a
flat
one
level
deep
directory
call
the
file
allocation
table
or
fat
which
tim
patterson
later
rework
for
do
it
function
well
for
limited
storage
floppy
disk
but
be
too
limited
for
a
hard
disk
system
which
might
contain
hundred
of
document
i
be
impressed
by
the
unix
alternative
when
i
d
first
encounter
it
at
harvard
a
hierarchical
file
system
with
a
root
directory
and
any
number
of
subdirectory
underneath
it
or
folder
within
folder
within
folder
it
allow
user
to
organize
their
data
any
way
they
saw
fit
what
computer
maker
wouldn
t
want
to
provide
this
improvement
if
they
could
but
it
soon
become
clear
that
ibm
be
commit
to
keep
do
as
close
as
possible
to
the
eight
thousand
byte
use
by
do
so
as
not
to
disrupt
their
exist
user
base
if
our
new
do
be
too
memory
hungry
ibm
fear
that
small
pc
system
would
run
out
of
room
for
some
popular
application
and
they
weren
t
accustom
to
contractor
go
beyond
their
spec
even
if
it
meant
they
be
get
more
for
their
money
ibm
s
developer
love
our
twenty
extra
feature
but
management
thought
we
be
cram
in
arbitrary
change
they
weren
t
pleased
that
do
be
now
triple
the
size
of

or
that
interim
deadline

they
re
the
customer
but
the
next
do
have
to
push
the
industry
forward
by
that
point
we
be
stand
six
inch
apart
chest
to
chest
and
nose
to
nose
mark
be
watch
like
a
horrify
teenager
whose
parent
sound
like
they
want
to
kill
each
other
there
be
no
physical
contact
but
mark
told
me
later
that
he
saw
some
spittle
fly
bill
wasn
t
reluctant
to
do
technically
difficult
thing
if
they
give
us
a
competitive
advantage
but
he
worried
that
i
d
get
distract
by
the
chance
to
do
something
cool
to
climb
some
technology
mountain
just
because
it
be
there
by
then
our
relationship
with
ibm
and
the
pc
compatibles
be
microsoft
s
lifeblood
bill
be
determine
to
keep
our
big
client
satisfied
and
he
probably
thought
i
wasn
t
give
that
enough
weight
after
ten
minute
of
mutual
apoplexy
and
an
epic
stare
down
bill
finally
say
ok
but
your
guy
well
hit
the
delivery
date
then
he
left
and
i
say
to
mark
make
sure
you
finish
get
all
those
feature
in
and
mark
and
his
team
somehow
satisfied
us
both
apple
be
more
than
a
brand
it
aim
to
become
part
of
your
lifestyle
we
re
cool
we
re
sleek
we
re
reliable
and
easy
to
use
we
think
different
it
wasn
t
an
accident
that
steve
job
have
tour
xerox
parc
a
year
ahead
of
me
at
that
point
the
high
end
apple
lisa
be
still
in
development
and
the
macintosh
be
a
low
onthe
totem
pole
one
man
project
as
bill
would
say
after
apple
unsuccessfully
sue
microsoft
for
copyright
infringement
over
window
gui
hey
steve
just
because
you
broke
into
xerox
s
house
before
i
do
and
take
the
tv
doesn
t
mean
i
can
t
go
in
later
and
take
the
stereo
early
in
job
invite
bill
and
me
down
to
see
a
macintosh
trial
run
as
we
sat
down
he
turn
to
a
young
developer
name
andy
hertzfeld
and
say
ok
let
s
show
them
what
we
ve
get
job
be
already
pitch
the
macintosh
as
a
computer
so
simple
that
even
his
mother
could
use
it
unfortunately
the
mac
prototype
we
saw
that
day
be
not
yet
insanely
great
and
the
display
lock
up
a
minute
or
so
after
booting
job
be
disgust
you
could
see
the
contempt
on
his
face
what
the
fuck
be
go
on
he
snarl
at
hertzfeld
who
d
probably
be
up
all
night
get
thing
ready
and
be
now
try
to
shrink
under
the
table
these
guy
come
all
the
way
down
here
to
see
this
thing
and
this
be
the
best
we
can
do
this
be
the
best
we
can
do
we
get
thirty
second
and
a
frozen
screen
what
the
fuck
be
wrong
with
you
he
rail
on
as
bill
and
i
trade
glance
and
uncomfortably
watch
the
performance
it
seem
to
me
like
an
exercise
in
humiliation
for
its
own
sake
we
couldn
t
believe
that
job
would
attack
a
subordinate
in
front
of
outsider
i
be
remind
of
that
incident
by
a
television
movie
call
pirate
of
silicon
valley
in
reimagining
microsoft
in
the
late
seventy
and
early
eighty
the
film
depicts
bill
as
an
bernerd
and
steve
ballmer
as
a
crude
cheerleader
while
i
m
the
beard
sidekick
who
love
gadget
and
crack
wise
now
and
then
job
played
by
noah
wyle
come
off
as
a
charismatic
but
ruthless
and
mean
spirit
jerk
the
next
time
i
ran
into
him
i
ask
him
what
he
thought
and
job
say
i
thought
the
guy
who
played
me
do
a
fantastic
job
he
just
didn
t
care
about
what
people
thought
of
his
public
persona
bill
be
different
he
want
to
be
view
as
tough
but
fair
he
could
be
callous
and
rude
but
he
have
a
warmer
human
side
too
and
no
one
doubt
that
his
excess
for
good
or
ill
be
spontaneous
when
bill
blew
his
stack
at
a
meeting
it
be
never
merely
for
effect
as
the
late
bob
wallace
once
say
the
only
stuff
worth
discuss
be
the
stuff
you
didn
t
agree
about
so
you
tend
mostly
to
argue
with
bill
microsoft
veteran
knew
the
drill
but
new
employee
could
be
traumatize
bill
would
miss
the
cue
from
those
who
react
with
stony
silence
or
cold
frustration
he
didn
t
always
notice
when
he
push
too
hard
when
someone
threaten
to
quit
bill
take
it
personally
and
do
all
he
could
to
change
the
person
s
mind
what
he
never
consider
though
be
that
he
might
lose
me
whenever
we
lock
horn
i
d
have
to
raise
my
intensity
and
my
blood
pressure
to
meet
bill
s
and
it
be
take
a
toll
some
people
can
vent
their
anger
take
a
breath
and
let
it
go
but
i
wasn
t
one
of
them
my
sinking
morale
sap
my
enthusiasm
for
my
work
which
in
turn
could
precipitate
bill
s
next
attack
top
executive
like
steve
ballmer
and
charles
simonyi
have
their
share
of
friction
with
bill
too
but
none
share
our
long
and
complex
history
i
d
know
the
ceo
long
before
there
be
a
microsoft
and
we
d
start
the
company
on
an
equal
footing
now
my
role
be
diminish
bill
stop
seek
me
out
on
a
regular
basis
and
i
go
in
to
see
him
less
and
less
too
angry
and
proud
to
make
an
emotional
appeal
i
never
go
in
and
told
bill
point
blank
some
day
work
with
you
be
like
be
in
hell
so
my
grievance
hung
in
the
air
unstated
and
unresolved
by
the
time
we
fought
over
do
our
partnership
be
living
on
borrow
time
on
june
to
get
my
point
across
without
get
distract
by
counterargument
and
rationale
i
decide
to
write
bill
a
letter
a
few
excerpt
about
two
month
ago
i
come
to
the
painful
conclusion
that
the
time
have
come
for
me
to
leave
microsoft
steve
convince
me
that
i
should
wait
to
discus
it
with
you
when
you
be
not
in
the
middle
of
a
series
of
trip
as
i
m
sure
you
realize
there
be
one
primary
reason
that
be
the
basis
for
my
decision
i
can
no
longer
tolerate
the
brow
beating
or
tirade
that
characterize
almost
every
attempt
i
make
to
discus
any
subject
that
be
controversial
the
kind
of
personal
verbal
attack
that
you
use
have
cost
many
hundred
of
hour
of
lose
productivity
in
my
case
alone
over
the
year
the
result
of
these
and
other
incident
have
be
the
gradual
destruction
of
both
our
friendship
and
our
ability
to
work
together
the
camaraderie
of
the
early
day
be
long
since
go
three
week
later
bill
hire
jim
towne
as
the
company
s
first
president
and
chief
operating
officer
because
they
d
need
to
interact
so
closely
bill
thought
it
make
sense
for
towne
to
take
my
office
i
didn
t
object
and
move
down
the
hall
towne
inherit
the
hot
seat
with
bill
pop
in
at
any
moment
to
grill
him
about
some
break
development
it
soon
become
apparent
that
the
new
president
lack
the
horsepower
that
bill
demand
i
knew
he
wouldn
t
last
when
bill
say
i
know
what
he
s
go
to
say
before
he
open
his
mouth
towne
left
the
company
less
than
a
year
later
as
the
summer
wore
on
my
twenty
yard
move
down
the
corridor
put
me
even
far
out
of
the
flow
though
neither
of
us
say
it
i
think
we
both
knew
that
it
couldn
t
go
on
this
way
for
long
chapter
wake
up
call
it
begin
that
summer
with
an
itch
behind
my
knee
at
the
oregon
shakespeare
festival
where
my
parent
would
take
us
to
see
nine
play
in
seven
day
when
i
be
in
junior
high
not
like
a
rash
you
get
from
the
wrong
soap
this
be
an
agony
that
have
me
claw
at
myself
after
the
itch
stop
the
night
sweat
begin
then
in
august
i
become
aware
of
a
tiny
hard
bump
on
the
right
side
of
my
neck
near
my
collarbone
over
the
next
several
week
it
grow
to
the
size
of
a
pencil
eraser
tip
it
didn
t
hurt
and
i
didn
t
know
that
any
lump
near
the
lymph
node
be
a
warn
sign
i
felt
as
bulletproof
as
most
people
under
thirty
i
take
my
health
for
grant
on
september
i
left
with
bill
on
a
european
press
tour
we
go
from
london
to
munich
where
i
felt
really
odd
after
drinking
a
beer
by
september
when
we
move
on
to
paris
i
be
exhaust
and
off
kilter
as
if
i
have
the
flu
except
there
be
no
fever
i
make
it
through
one
press
conference
and
then
i
be
do
i
flew
home
to
see
my
doctor
who
felt
my
neck
and
say
you
re
go
in
for
a
biopsy
tomorrow
morning
i
checked
into
swedish
medical
center
in
downtown
seattle
my
first
hospital
stay
since
have
my
tonsil
out
as
a
child
that
night
i
dream
that
a
gumby
like
creature
be
stuck
to
me
it
be
make
of
black
tar
and
i
just
couldn
t
get
it
off
i
awoke
in
a
panic
on
september
they
perform
the
biopsy
after
i
come
out
of
anesthesia
the
surgeon
enter
my
room
look
grim
mr
allen
he
say
i
take
out
as
much
as
i
could
but
our
initial
diagnosis
be
lymphoma
i
knew
that
be
cancer
but
not
much
else
and
as
i
found
out
more
i
get
terrify
in
those
day
even
early
stage
lymphoma
have
a
fifty
fifty
chance
of
kill
you
i
try
to
make
sense
of
the
possibility
that
i
might
soon
die
i
d
have
twenty
nine
good
year
but
i
couldn
t
help
feel
cheat
i
have
so
much
more
to
explore
and
experience
the
next
morning
the
surgeon
and
oncology
team
return
all
smile
we
ve
get
good
news
the
surgeon
say
you
ve
get
hodgkin
s
disease
an
in
depth
look
have
modify
their
diagnosis
the
cure
rate
s
in
the
midnineties
if
it
s
early
stage
he
go
on
you
re
go
to
be
fine
you
re
go
to
recover
from
this
i
want
to
believe
him
it
sound
good
and
everyone
s
body
language
seem
positive
but
i
be
still
in
shock
from
the
day
before
the
hospital
need
to
stage
my
illness
to
see
how
far
it
have
progress
begin
with
a
more
invasive
biopsy
that
drew
bone
marrow
from
my
hip
i
make
the
mistake
of
buying
a
book
about
hodgkin
s
that
show
how
tumor
could
metastasize
with
chart
on
survival
outcome
and
it
scar
the
heck
out
of
me
the
bad
part
be
wait
for
test
result
as
the
bump
on
my
neck
kept
grow
to
the
size
of
a
robin
s
egg
my
father
a
testicular
cancer
survivor
told
me
son
none
of
this
stuff
be
pleasant
but
you
have
to
take
it
like
a
man
that
might
sound
cold
in
print
but
know
that
he
d
gotten
through
it
be
comfort
to
me
i
couldn
t
give
in
to
panic
or
despair
i
have
to
tough
it
out
then
good
news
they
d
caught
my
disease
in
stage
a
before
it
have
spread
early
stage
hodgkin
s
lymphoma
be
one
of
the
most
curable
cancer
i
d
drawn
a
scary
card
but
hardly
the
bad
i
begin
a
six
week
course
of
radiation
five

week

quiet
as
people
wait
to

one
day
a
man

in
and
ask
for

as
fast
as
i
could
a
month
in
after
they
start
target
my
spleen
the
nausea
come
in
wave
i
d
race
home
before
throw
up
for
hour
over
two
month
i
lose
twenty
pound
at
home
i
rest
and
listen
to
music
i
spent
time
with
my
parent
and
sister
but
i
need
more
to
distract
me
so
instead
of
do
the
sane
thing
and
take
a
leave
i
go
into
the
office
a
few
afternoon
a
week
just
to
keep
my
hand
in
that
be
the
no
excuse
microsoft
culture
relentless
commitment
to
work
strive
for
normalcy
i
even
take
a
weekend
beginner
s
ski
class
when
i
have
barely
enough
energy
to
coast
down
a
hill
halfway
through
therapy
my
white
cell
count
drop
so
low
that
they
have
to
stop
for
several
week
but
by
then
the
tumor
be
shrink
there
be
no
guarantee
of
a
cure
and
i
still
felt
sick
and
debilitate
but
i
begin
to
be
encourage
after
resume
the
radiation
i
be
in
bill
s
office
one
day
talk
about
m
do
revenue
our
flat
fee
strategy
have
help
establish
us
in
several
market
but
i
thought
we
d
held
on
to
it
for
too
long
a
case
in
point
we
d
gotten
a
fee
of
for
the
license
for
applesoft
basic
after
sale
of
more
than
a
million
apple
ii
s
that
amount
to
two
cent
per
copy
if
we
want
to
maximize
revenue
i
say
we
have
to
start
charge
royalty
for
do
bill
reply
as
though
he
be
speak
to
a
not
so
bright
child
how
do
you
think
we
get
the
market
share
we
have
today
then
steve
come
by
to
weigh
in
on
bill
s
side
with
his
usual
intensity
it
would
have
be
two
on
one
except
i
be
approximately
half
a
person
at
the
time
microsoft
later
switch
to
per
copy
licensing
a
move
that
would
add
billion
of
dollar
in
revenue
not
long
after
that
incident
i
told
steve
that
i
might
start
my
own
company
i
told
bill
that
my
day
as
a
full
time
executive
at
microsoft
be
probably
numbered
and
that
i
thought
i
d
be
happier
on
my
own
i
be
still
undergo
therapy
when
bill
sign
off
on
my
proposal
to
start
a
microsoft
hardware
group
which
set
about
design
a
plug
in
mouse
for
charles
simonyi
s
gui
application
we
contract
with
a
japanese
manufacturing
firm
call
alp
and
soon
a
microsoft
mouse
prototype
take
shape
a
metal
finish
track
ball
and
a
pair
of
shaft
to
read
the
ball
s
movement
and
decode
direction
and
distance
don
burtis
create
a
card
that
could
interpret
those
signal
for
the
pc
it
be
thirteen
year
before
the
advent
of
universal
serial
bus
connection
the
big
question
be
how
many
button
i
decide
on
two
a
compromise
between
the
three
button
mouse
on
the
alto
and
the
one
button
model
steve
job
be
develop
for
the
lisa
i
visit
job
in
palo
alto
around
that
time
to
hear
more
about
his
plan
for
the
macintosh
apple
s
cheaper
gui
machine
then
still
in
development
we
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
mac
which
would
give
our
gui
application
microsoft
word
and
excel
a
welcome
foothold
until
the
pc
platform
and
our
new
window
operating
system
caught
up
to
them
job
launch
into
a
soliloquy
about
the
glory
of
the
graphical
user
interface
not
know
he
be
preach
to
the
choir
after
i
let
it
slip
that
we
be
planning
a
mouse
for
microsoft
word
job
put
their
one
button
mouse
through
its
pace
when
i
ask
him
whether
two
button
might
be
well
he
passionately
lecture
me
you
know
paul
this
be
all
about
simplicity
versus
complexity
and
nobody
need
more
than
one
button
on
a
mouse
i
say
but
steve
people
have
more
than
one
finger
and
there
s
go
to
be
thing
they
might
want
to
do
with
a
right
click
too
job
dismiss
my
point
with
a
shake
of
his
head
he
believe
in
make
the
entry
level
experience
as
unintimidating
as
possible
and
that
there
be
usually
one
and
only
one
correct
way
to
do
thing
at
microsoft
we
try
to
balance
simplicity
with
power
i
consider
the
trade
off
worthwhile
if
an
extra
feature
make
a
program
or
device
more
functional
when
word
come
out
before
the
mac
in
our
first
generation
mouse
didn
t
sell
very
well
despite
a
retail
price
less
than
half
of
our
competition
s
jon
shirley
who
succeed
towne
as
microsoft
s
president
that
year
would
complain
that
we
have
mouse
infest
warehouse
the
main
problem
be
word
a
dumbed
down
pre
window
attempt
to
mimic
a
graphical
user
interface
but
i
wasn
t
discourage
our
strategy
be
gear
toward
introduce
people
to
a
new
experience
that
would
pave
the
way
for
well
version
of
our
software
in
time
i
d
be
vindicate
window
be
introduce
in
eventually
become
the
dominant
gui
personal
computer
platform
the

many
incarnation

wireless
laser
bluetooth
as
one
of
the

product
and
every
one
of
those
mouse
have
more
than
one
button
people
quickly
adapt
today
that
extra
button
help
million
of
window
user
gain
access
to
context
menu
and
a
host
of
other
convenient
feature
postscript
in
after
twenty
two
year
of
one
button
worship
apple
relent
and
release
the
multibutton
mighty
mouse
one
even
in
late
december
i
heard
bill
and
steve
speak
heatedly
in
bill
s
office
and
pause
outside
to
listen
in
it
be
easy
to
get
the
gist
of
the
conversation
they
be
bemoan
my
recent
lack
of
production
and
discuss
how
they
might
dilute
my
microsoft
equity
by
issue
option
to
themselves
and
other
shareholder
it
be
clear
that
they
d
be
think
about
this
for
some
time
unable
to
stand
it
any
longer
i
burst
in
on
them
and
shout
this
be
unbelievable
it
show
your
true
character
once
and
for
all
i
be
speak
to
both
of
them
but
star
straight
at
bill
caught
red
hand
they
be
struck
dumb
before
they
could
respond
i
turn
on
my
heel
and
left
i
replayed
their
dialogue
in
my
mind
while
drive
home
and
it
felt
more
and
more
heinous
to
me
i
help
start
the
company
and
be
still
an
active
member
of
management
though
limited
by
my
illness
and
now
my
partner
and
my
colleague
be
scheme
to
rip
me
off
it
be
mercenary
opportunism
plain
and
simple
that
even
a
chasten
steve
ballmer
call
my
house
and
ask
jody
if
he
could
come
over
look
paul
he
say
after
we
sat
down
together
i
m
really
sorry
about
what
happen
today
we
be
just
let
off
steam
we
re
try
to
get
so
much
stuff
do
and
we
just
wish
you
could
contribute
even
more
but
that
stock
thing
isn
t
fair
i
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
it
and
i
m
sure
bill
wouldn
t
either
i
told
steve
that
the
incident
have
left
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
a
few
day
later
i
receive
a
six
page
handwritten
letter
from
bill
date
december
the
last
day
of
our
last
full
year
together
at
microsoft
it
contain
an
apology
for
the
conversation
i
d
overheard
and
it
offer
a
reveal
bill
s
eye
view
of
our
partnership
during
the
last
year
we
have
have
numerous
disagreement
however
i
doubt
any
two
partner
have
ever
agree
on
as
much
both
in
term
of
specific
decision
and
their
general
idea
of
how
to
view
thing
true
we
be
extraordinary
partner
despite
our
difference
few
cofounder
have
share
such
a
unified
vision
maybe
hewlett
and
packard
or
google
s
sergey
brin
and
larry
page
but
it
be
a
short
list
sometimes
i
think
that
i
have
more
confidence
in
your
ability
than
you
do
your
strong
association
with
softcard
always
surprise
me
frankly
breakthrough
idea
like
softcard
be
great
but
they
be
not
necessary
bill
knew
that
softcard
be
still
a
sore
point
with
me
he
walk
a
fine
line
here
try
to
acknowledge
my
contribution
without
give
it
too
much
weight
the
company
be
really
in
great
shape
by
some
measure
however
the
company
be
in
bad
shape
by
one
measure
we
be
a
lot
less
unique
than
we
be
before
our
product
spec
s
and
overall
approach
be
sic
not
as
unique
as
they
should
be
early
in
the
life
of
microsoft
nobody
else
have
what
we
have
a
robust
yet
compact
basic
for
microcomputer
plus
a
proven
set
of
development
tool
when
we
achieve
a
dominant
position
with
m
do
no
other
product
compare
but
as
the
industry
mature
microsoft
s
rate
of
innovation
have
slow
the
company
need
all
of
the
out
of
the
box
idea
it
could
muster
and
bill
didn
t
want
mine
to
slip
away
paul
sometimes
i
feel
like
you
be
tell
me
i
m
a
bad
guy
or
that
the
company
be
bad
sometimes
i
feel
like
you
don
t
understand
all
the
effort
that
s
go
into
the
company
in
fact
i
be
well
aware
of
the
tremendous
effort
that
bill
and
others
have
invest
to
make
microsoft
great
after
all
i
d
be
part
of
it
i
know
you
ve
thought
about
this
more
than
i
have
but
do
you
really
want
to
be
a
solo
performer
i
understand
want
to
take
time
off
but
if
you
really
want
to
work
solo
why
do
you
come
back
to
boston
and
convince
me
to
drop
out
of
school
your
best
work
have
be
help
to
plan
and
design
not
execute
bill
be
right
our
great
string
of
success
have
married
my
vision
to
his
unmatched
aptitude
for
business
but
that
be
beside
the
point
once
i
be
diagnose
with
hodgkin
s
my
decision
become
simpler
if
i
be
to
relapse
it
would
be
pointless
if
not
hazardous
to
return
to
the
stress
at
microsoft
if
i
continued
to
recover
i
now
understood
that
life
be
too
short
to
spend
it
unhappily
bill
s
letter
be
a
last
ditch
effort
to
get
me
to
stay
and
i
knew
he
believe
he
have
logic
on
his
side
but
it
didn
t
change
anything
my
mind
be
make
up
as
the
new
year
begin
there
be
much
to
be
do
at
microsoft
the
multi
tool
product
line
be
evolve
into
what
would
eventually
become
microsoft
office
with
mac
version
already
under
way
there
be
excitement
over
window
or
interface
manager
as
it
be
call
until
someone
in
marketing
persuade
bill
that
window
be
sexier
the
company
have
plenty
of
innovative
product
in
the
pipeline
i
felt
like
i
be
leave
it
in
good
shape
by
the
end
bill
and
i
have
diverge
in
way
that
go
beyond
our
yell
match
his
extreme
competitiveness
help
make
him
a
historically
successful
ceo
but
it
also
destabilize
our
relationship
one
small
example
come
before
i
left
the
company
when
bill
be
give
me
a
hard
time
about
everything
i
hadn
t
be
do
in
my
defense
i
say
the
trs
model
math
package
be
a
big
job
and
it
turn
out
pretty
well
a
year
or
so
earlier
tandy
have
ask
us
for
a
decimal
float
point
math
program
for
their
early
notebook
computer
a
must
for
precise
financial
calculation
i
d
never
do
one
before
and
sweat
bullet
for
month
to
get
it
right
and
bill
say
i
write
all
that
code
really
i
say
he
d
say
these
thing
with
such
conviction
that
it
make
me
wonder
for
a
moment
have
i
write
it
i
go
back
and
found
the
source
code
and
print
it
out
and
of
course
it
be
mine
bill
hadn
t
write
a
single
line
in
fact
he
wasn
t
even
write
code
at
that
point
the
next
day
i
go
back
to
his
office
i
drop
the
listing
on
his
desk
and
say
ok
bill
here
s
the
math
package
show
me
what
you
write
it
be
a
strange
moment
bill
froze
in
mid
rock
glance
down
at
the
code
and
mutter
yeah
you
do
write
it
sometimes
it
seem
that
bill
so
utterly
identify
with
microsoft
that
he
d
get
confuse
about
where
the
company
left
off
and
he
begin
i
didn
t
feel
quite
the
same
way
the
business
be
hugely
important
but
it
do
not
define
me
i
wasn
t
sure
what
the
future
held
or
even
how
much
of
it
i
d
have
to
enjoy
but
i
look
forward
to
a
new
phase
i
have
never
forgotten
my
father
s
advice
whatever
you
do
you
should
love
it
my
dad
be
happy
for
me
when
i
d
return
to
seattle
four
year
earlier
full
of
idea
and
enthusiasm
it
seem
to
him
that
i
d
found
my
call
and
i
thought
i
have
too
but
now
it
be
time
to
go
in
january
i
met
with
bill
for
one
final
time
as
a
microsoft
executive
as
he
sat
down
with
me
on
the
couch
in
his
office
i
knew
that
he
d
try
to
make
me
feel
guilty
and
oblige
to
stay
month
after
vern
raburn
have
left
to
go
to
lotus
development
bill
write
to
me
that
he
be
still
confuse
and
hurt
about
what
have
go
wrong
but
once
he
saw
he
couldn
t
change
my
mind
bill
try
to
cut
his
loss
when
microsoft
incorporate
in
our
old
partnership
agreement
be
nullified
and
with
it
his
power
to
force
me
to
accept
a
buyout
base
on
irreconcilable
difference
now
he
try
a
different
tack
one
he
d
hint
at
in
his
letter
it
s
not
fair
that
you
keep
your
stake
in
the
company
he
say
he
make
a
lowball
offer
for
my
stock
five
dollar
a
share
when
vern
left
the
microsoft
board
vote
to
buy
back
his
stock
at
three
dollar
a
share
which
ultimately
cost
him
billion
of
dollar
i
knew
that
bill
hop
to
pressure
me
to
sell
mine
the
same
way
but
i
be
in
a
different
position
than
vern
who
d
jumped
to
lotus
in
apparent
violation
of
his
employment
agreement
i
be
a
cofounder
and
i
wasn
t
leave
to
join
a
competitor
i
m
not
sure
i
m
willing
to
sell
i
counter
but
i
wouldn
t
even
discus
less
than
ten
dollar
a
share
no
way
bill
say
as
i
d
suspect
he
would
our
talk
be
over
as
it
turn
out
bill
s
conservatism
work
to
my
advantage
if
he
d
be
willing
to
offer
something
close
to
my
ask
price
i
would
have
sell
way
too
soon
on
february
my
resignation
become
official
i
retain
my
seat
on
the
board
and
be
subsequently
vote
vice
chairman
as
a
tribute
to
my
contribution
and
in
the
hope
that
i
would
continue
to
add
value
to
the
company
i
d
help
create
with
my
hodgkin
s
in
remission
i
didn
t
know
what
to
do
next
i
just
knew
that
i
want
to
enjoy
life
i
would
literally
stop
in
my
track
to
look
at
a
flower
or
the
sky
or
consciously
savor
a
moment
with
family
or
friend
though
my
microsoft
share
be
not
yet
liquid
i
be
in
decent
financial
shape
i
have
a
nice
house
and
enough
money
in
the
bank
to
pay
my
bill
for
a
while
and
travel
that
spring
i
go
to
hawaii
with
marc
mcdonald
and
ric
weiland
as
a
boy
i
d
thrill
to
sean
connery
s
scuba
adventure
in
james
bond
film
like
thunderball
when
i
found
out
that
our
hotel
have
a
pool
where
you
could
try
breathing
with
scuba
gear
i
jumped
at
the
chance
the
next
day
i
do
a
shore
dive
among
the
brilliant
fish
that
swam
around
the
reef
and
i
be
hooked
dive
take
me
into
a
different
physical
realm
something
like
be
an
astronaut
i
suppose
i
become
a
certify
diver
two
year
later
and
have
since
dive
throughout
the
world
from
the
gal
pagos
to
the
red
sea
it
s
my
great
escape
i
wasn
t
home
long
before
i
take
off
again
this
time
on
a
road
trip
to
anadarko
with
my
father
join
me
for
the
home
stretch
we
saw
my
uncle
louis
who
take
us
to
a
classic
barbecue
spot
and
then
to
his
western
wear
store
where
i
disappointed
him
by
choose
a
plain
leather
pair
of
boot
over
snakeskin
or
alligator
my
dad
drove
back
to
seattle
with
me
and
the
road
get
him
talk
about
a
subject
he
d
never
broach
before
his
experience
in
world
war
ii
when
he
d
be
part
of
the
second
wave
that
land
at
normandy
it
get
pretty
hot
a
few
time
he
say
he
told
me
about
the
german
buzz
bomb
that
rain
on
the
troop
as
they
wait
in
england
before
cross
the
channel
at
a
give
point
a
cut
off
valve
sent
those
early
cruise
missile
into
a
dive
if
the
soldier
heard
the
buzzing
stop
overhead
they
d
lunge
under
their
card
table
for
whatever
shelter
they
could
find
there
be
one
last
thing
my
father
told
me
as
we
drove
along
before
lapse
back
into
his
typical
silence
if
you
take
care
of
your
men
they
ll
take
care
of
you
though
in
remission
i
still
wait
for
something
bad
to
happen
my
doctor
told
me
i
d
be
in
the
clear
if
i
have
no
recurrence
within
three
year
and
that
the
odds
be
on
my
side
a
percent
chance
of
a
cure
but
i
couldn
t
stop
think
about
that
other
percent
i
be
still
recover
from
the
blow
of
the
first
diagnosis
from
hearing
i
might
die
i
take
it
harder
than
some
might
have
whenever
i
caught
a
bad
cold
or
felt
a
strange
sensation
i
get
a
sinking
feel
i
have
a
battery
of
test
every
two
month
follow
by
day
of
anxiety
before
the
result
come
in
one
day
in
may
i
woke
up
with
my
chest
throb
i
have
blood
drawn
to
check
my
sed
rate
a
measure
of
inflammation
in
the
body
it
come
back
at
about
double
the
norm
a
number
that
might
indicate
cancer
i
be
sure
that
my
hodgkin
s
have
come
back
at
best
i
thought
i
d
face
the
ordeal
of
chemotherapy
at
bad
the
end
could
be
near
on
friday
may
i
repeat
the
test
which
would
take
several
day
to
process
rather
than
wait
at
home
i
flew
to
the
national
computer
conference
in
anaheim
california
i
kept
feel
bad
and
more
worried
unable
to
sleep
and
left
the
convention
early
for
a
late
night
flight
back
to
seattle
in
the
air
at
some
point
after
midnight
i
be
panicked
enough
to
draft
a
handwritten
will
in
distribute
my
million
share
of
microsoft
stock
i
sensibly
advise
the
recipient
to
hold
on
to
them
for
a
while
to
enjoy
the
maximum
return
hour
later

with
the
test
result
all
good
my
sed
rate
have
drop
to
my
chest
pain
be
inconsequential
that
be
a
great
day
everything
seem
possible
again
as
i
write
in
my
journal
tonight
i
walk
around
green
lake
at
sunset
it
be
a
beautiful
sight
i
even
saw
a
huge
catfish
swim
by
the
shore
two
week
after
my
scare
i
travel
with
my
dad
to
twin
lake
our
old
family
vacation
spot
the
two
of
us
revert
to
our
usual
interaction
style
lot
of
fishing
and
reading
and
not
much
conversation
one
day
my
father
hooked
a
huge
rainbow
trout
and
battle
it
for
half
an
hour
before
he
could
angle
it
up
to
our
boat
i
stood
by
net
in
hand
when
the
fight
be
over
and
the
fish
safely
in
the
boat
my
dad
grin
like
i
d
never
see
him
grin
before
it
be
as
though
he
d
reconnected
with
the
best
day
of
his
youth
he
d
caught
the
big
trout
he
would
ever
catch
and
he
be
content
near
the
end
of
our
stay
out
of
the
blue

at
me
and
say

happens
to
me
always

care
of
your
mother
and
your
sister
it
wasn
t
like
him
to
be
explicit
about
such
thing
but
perhaps
he
d
have
a
premonition
i
d
rarely
be
abroad
except
on
business
but
now

get
to
build
that
little
place
on
the
river
that
he
d
talk
about
where
you
could
fish
for
steelhead
whenever
you
want
when
my
uncle
come
up
to
make
the
arrangement
i
could
barely
speak
i
be
in
utter
shock
i
couldn
t
believe
that
my
dad
be
go
we
d
left
a
lot
of
thing
unsaid
and
now
i
hadn
t
have
a
chance
to
say
good
bye
later
i
d
commemorate
him
by
establish
a
library
endowment
fund
in
his
name
at
uw
where
so
many
people
love
him
in
a
new
addition
be
complete
that
now
hold
more
than
a
million
volume
the
kenneth
s
allen
library
include
the
earth
and
space
science
collection
that
absorbed
me
on
many
a
weekend
when
i
be
young
my
own
memento
be
much
small
an
oval
of
turquoise
that
my
father
have
for
year
before
find
a
silver
set
in
santa
fe
a
few
month
before
he
die
i
have
worn
that
ring
ever
since
and
i
think
of
him
each
time
the
stone
catch
my
eye

lose
the
camaraderie
and
creative
work
at
microsoft
left
a
hole
in
my
life
i
miss
the
good
time
with
bill
when
we
d
spur
each
other
on
to
big
and
well
idea
though
the
occasion
have
grown
few
toward
the
end
but
i
never
felt
tempt
to
reconsider
my
departure
it
be
like
a
fail
romance
part
of
the
relationship
have
be
wonderful
but
i
remember
the
negative
too
i
could
not
go
back
microsoft
kept
an
office
for
me
for
quite
a
while
when
i
come
in
now
and
then
to
brainstorm
with
my
old
development
guy
i
be
treat
as
an
elder
statesman
i
d
get
copy
on
some
memo
but
i
wasn
t
really
in
the
loop
my
guy
would
tell
me
that
upper
management
seem
less
balance
now
that
bill
have
lose
his
technical
foil
in
chief
as
the
company
kept
grow
and
change
it
wouldn
t
be
long
before
my
legacy
become
less
personal
than
the
stuff
of
company
lore
one
day
a
big
stack
of
box
arrive
at
my
home
they
be
consolidate
office
space
and
they
d
packed
up
my
thing
and
sent
them
to
me
that
felt
like
closure
of
a
sort
for
a
time
i
be
happy
travel
back
and
forth
to
france
and
spending
time
with
francoise
i
thought
i
d
retire
at
age
thirty
and
follow
my
inclination
once
microsoft
go
public
i
d
never
have
to
worry
about
money
but
after
a
year
and
a
half
of
vacation
i
get
restless
i
saw
what
happen
to
my
father
after
he
d
trade
his
librarian
s
job
for
fishing
and
his
garden
he
seem
diminish
somehow
i
didn
t
want
that
to
happen
to
me
luckily
some
new
idea
lay
in
wait
chapter
hellhound
bill
and
i
kept
in
touch
after
i
left
microsoft
but
it
take
me
a
while
to
get
past
the
bitterness
of
my
last
month
there
when
bill
offer
to
invest
in
my
new
company
asymetrix
i
decide
against
it
i
want
to
see
where
i
could
take
it
on
my
own
without
his
help
over
time
though
the
hard
feeling
fade
in
when
microsoft
roll
out
window
bill
be
generous
enough
to
share
the
stage
with
me
and
toolbook
an
asymetrix
product
after
a
five
year
hiatus
i
rejoin
the
microsoft
board
and
when
bill
get
married
in
he
include
me
in
his
wedding
party
after
he
become
a
family
man
we
found
a
pattern
not
uncommon
among
old
friend
we
saw
each
other
a
handful
of
time
a
year
take
in
a
movie
or
go
to
lunch
we
d
fall
into
old
rhythm
that
high
bandwidth
exchange
of
idea
a
reminder
of
our
once
powerful
bond
by
the
late
s
microsoft
be
the
large
and
most
profitable
software
company
in
history
grow
at
the
same
rate
as
the
personal
computer
industry
very
rapid
growth
indeed
armageddon
seem
unlikely
yet
bill
still
saw
the
glass
as
seven
eighth
empty
while
microsoft
stock
option
have
create
thousand
of
millionaire
include
some
long
tenure
secretary
it
also
lead
to
a
gradual
exodus
as
people
retire
early
or
go
off
to
try
their
own
start
ups
bill
have
do
well
too
of
course
twenty
year
after
we
d
found
the
company
he
be
the
richest
person
in
the
world
but
he
felt
beset
by
shareholder
and
wall
street
expectation
for
ever
increase
profitability
and
growth
as
the
company
s
chairman
and
ceo
bill
be
never
one
to
hype
future
earnings
he
d
make
modest
prediction
to
set
the
stage
for
the
company
to
shine
when
it
exceed
projection
but
as
microsoft
s
stock
price
rise
by
a
multiple
of
nearly
a
hundred
in
the
s
he
found
those
victory
harder
to
pull
off
to
be
fair
he
have
a
tough
tough
job
in
the
high
tech
field
there
s
tremendous
pressure
even
when
you
re
do
well
you
have
to
run
incredibly
hard
just
to
hold
your
competitive
position
as
bill
told
tom
brokaw
on
an
nbc
special
in
technology
be
a
very
scary
business
if
you
fall
behind
technically
no
matter
how
much
your
past
success
have
be
it
s
no
guarantee
that
you
ll
keep
do
well
in
the
future
within
month
of
that
appearance
in
an
internal
memo
that
spread
swiftly
over
the
internet
bill
point
to
netscape
navigator
as
the
main
obstacle
to
microsoft
s
ascendance
on
the
internet
tidal
wave
which
he
now
consider
the
key
to
the
company
s
future
and
because
navigator
didn
t
require
a
richly
endow
operating
system
it
be
also
a
threat
to
window
and
office
microsoft
s
core
business
leader
tend
to
stick
with
the
style
that
make
them
successful
in
bill
s
case
the
try
and
true
formula
be
hyperaggression
and
supercompetitiveness
when
your
company
becomes
the
industry
leader
though
the
game
change
and
you
need
to
ease
off
to
avoid
too
much
resentment
from
the
rest
of
the
ecosystem
but
bill
couldn
t
back
down
that
wasn
t
in
his
dna
he
sent
the
same
public
message
over
and
over
again
we
take
on
all
comer
and
we
clobber
them
just
day
before
the
brokaw
special
when
the
new
york
time
magazine
portrayed
microsoft
on
its
cover
as
an
eight
hundred
pound
gorilla
it
signal
something
ominous
bill
s
hard
nose
approach
on
top
of
microsoft
s
run
of
success
have
provoke
a
backlash
from
competitor
and
their
ally
in
the
federal
government
the
antitrust
campaign
against
microsoft
come
to
a
head
in
when
the
justice
department
demand
a
stiff
fine
against
the
company
for
allege
violation
a
parallel
case
be
advance
in
the
european
union
still
on
the
company
s
board
i
advise
bill
to
temper
his
stance
look
microsoft
be
go
to
win
anyway
from
the
momentum
of
the
market
and
the
position
we
re
in
you
don
t
need
to
be
so
aggressive
i
question
bill
s
assertion
that
internet
explorer
have
to
be
embed
within
window
for
the
operating
system
to
work
right
a
key
point
of
dispute
in
the
federal
lawsuit
there
be
no
technical
necessity
for
the
bundling
since
window
could
be
tie
to
any
competent
browser
and
work
just
as
well
the
company
have
since
acknowledge
as
much
in
a
settlement
with
the
eu
that
allows
user
to
choose
any
browser
they
wish
but
bill
insist
as
a
matter
of
legal
principle
that
a
company
have
the
right
to
add
feature
to
a
product
even
when
that
product
monopolize
the
market
what
he
fail
to
grasp
despite
warning
from
many
be
that
the
government
s
case
wouldn
t
hinge
on
its
legal
merit
the
attack
on
microsoft

may
microsoft

take
advantage
of

to
undermine
consumer
choice
say
attorney
general
janet
reno
the
department
of
justice
will
not
tolerate
that
kind
of
conduct

rather
than
simply
respond
to

question
he
belittle
them
what
do
you
mean
by
internet
software
not
only
be
that
question
ridiculous
but
i
m
go
to
explain
just
how
ridiculous
it
be
and
how
clueless
you
be
about
the
software
business
bill
be
sarcastic
combative
defensive
and
contemptuous
i
knew
those
trait
well
but
they
be
less
than
helpful
on
the
stand
he
might
as
well
have
told
the
department
of
justice
and
by
extension
the
judge
that
the
antitrust
case
be
the
stupidest
thing
he
have
ever
heard
anti
microsoft
sentiment
become
widespread
and
intense
and
it
cut
bill
to
the
core
he
d
be
the
darling
of
the
business
press
the
crafty
entrepreneur
and
technology
genius
now
the
medium
portrayed
him
as
a
bully
who
d
bent
the
rule
and
probably
broken
them
after
he
call
me
late
one
weekend
afternoon
i
met
him
in
the
living
room
of
the
lakeside
estate
i
d
help
him
choose
year
before
bill
look
drawn
as
though
he
hadn
t
slept
for
day
redline
from
stress
he
show
a
side
of
himself
that
many
would
have
found
surprising
he
d
be
try
to
move
the
company
forward
all
these
year
he
say
but
the
strain
of
expectation
have
grown
too
much
for
him
i
ve
be
try
to
pump
air
in
the
balloon
he
say
and
now
the
balloon
s
pop
i
can
t
keep
it
go
anymore
not
everyone
saw
microsoft
in
a
bad
light
i
be
din
alone
one
night
at
il
mulino
the
italian
place
in
new
york
s
west
village
when
i
notice
a
middle
age
man
in
a
double
breast
jacket
at
a
corner
table
in
the
back
he
have
slick
back
hair
and
a
statuesque
lady
at
his
side
and
he
be
sit
with
his
back
to
the
wall
where
he
could
eye
the
entrance
toward
closing
time
he
saunter
over
and
say
be
you
mr
allen
he
have
a
thick
new
jersey
accent
something
out
of
the
soprano
after
i
confirm
my
identity
he
say
your
company
s
involve
in
that
antitrust
trial
yes
i
say
i
wasn
t
quite
sure
where
this
be
go
your
mr
ball
mer
say
some
very
critical
thing
about
the
attorney
general
yes
i
say
in
the
event
lead
up
to
the
antitrust
suit
steve
have
gotten
front
page
press
by
declare
to
heck
with
janet
reno
now
i
be
get
a
little
nervous
and
the
man
say
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
say
the
same
thing
but
i
m
not
in
a
position
to
say
them
tell
your
mr
ball
mer
when
you
see
him
that
there
s
someone
who
appreciates
what
he
s
say
relieve
i
say
i
ll
tell
him
on
april
judge
thomas
penfield
jackson
rule
that
microsoft
have
violate
the
sherman
antitrust
act
two
month
later
the
other
shoe
drop
jackson
order
the
company
broken
into
two
one
for
operating
system
and
the
second
for
other
software
i
thought
the
judge
have
overreach
the
remedy
seem
draconian
way
out
of
proportion
to
the
violation
found
by
the
court
the
judge
be
out
of
bound
he
just
hate
us
bill
say
this
will
never
stand
up
on
appeal
he
be
probably
right
but
what
if
he
wasn
t
how
much
synergy
would
microsoft
lose
if
window
be
split
off
from
microsoft
s
application
would
our
software
be
marginalize
which
company
would
bill
go
with
and
what
would
happen
to
the
other
a
few
month
later
shortly
after
i
end
my
second
stint
on
the
microsoft
board
a
federal
appeal
court
reverse
the
breakup
order
the
final
settlement
impose
relatively
mild
penalty
but
the
case
s
impact
on
microsoft
be
profound
because
it
siphon
so
much
time
and
energy
especially
from
bill
in
a
company
where
tech
decision
be
still
ultracentralized
the
repercussion
of
a
distract
ceo
have
to
be
damage
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
how
much
it
affected
microsoft
s
course
in
those
critical
year
and
over
the
difficult
decade
that
follow
even
though
he
d
seem
frayed
of
late
i
be
stun
when
bill
announce
that
he
be
step
aside
to
become
chief
software
architect
in
january
with
steve
ballmer
succeed
him
as
ceo
steve
have
be
best
man
at
bill
s
wedding
yet
they
have
a
tacit
rivalry
that
go
back
to
harvard
where
they
d
vied
to
see
who
d
get
the
well
grade
while
steve
have
long
serve
as
bill
s
top
lieutenant
you
get
the
sense
through
the
ninety
that
he
wasn
t
necessarily
be
groom
for
microsoft
s
top
spot
i
d
say
that
bill
view
him
as
a
very
smart
executive
with
less
affinity
for
technology
than
for
the
business
side
that
steve
just
wasn
t
a
product
guy
it
take
a
while
for
bill
to
come
around
to
what
seem
obvious
to
the
rest
of
the
board
whatever
his
strength
and
weakness
steve
be
the
only
viable
successor
bill
make
it
clear
that
he
d
still
be
microsoft
s
technical
leader
he
look
over
the
new
ceo
s
shoulder
at
every
turn
and
openly
chafed
at
his
own
wan
influence
steve
call
me
several
time
to
complain
that
bill
have
challenged
him
during
meeting
what
be
i
suppose
to
do
you
ve
get
to
take
him
aside
i
d
say
you
have
to
tell
him
that
he
can
t
contradict
you
in
front
of
your
people
anymore
you
re
the
ceo
now
you
have
to
be
direct
with
bill
it
didn
t
work
any
other
way
in
bill
announce
that
he
d
be
leave
his
managerial
role
with
microsoft
two
year
later
to
focus
on
his
health
and
education
work
at
the
bill
melinda
gate
foundation
i
try
to
tell
him
that
thing
would
be
different
after
he
left
once
you
re
no
longer
a
decision
maker
people
don
t
look
at
you
the
same
way
i
remember
what
i
d
go
through
when
i
try
to
keep
my
hand
in
after
leave
the
company
it
take
me
about
a
year
to
come
to
the
realization
that
my
advice
no
longer
count
for
much
for
bill
the
ground
have
already
begin
shift
at
product
review
meeting
his
scathing
critique
become
a
perverse
badge
of
honor
one
game
be
to
count
how
many
time
bill
confront
a
give
manager
whoever
get
tag
for
the
most
stupidest
thing
won
the
contest
i
give
my
feedback
he
grumble
to
me
and
it
doesn
t
go
anywhere
by
the
time
he
finally
left
the
company

day

almost
anticlimactic
in

that
even

a
recent
year
long
study
by

found
that
percent
of

article
be
mainly
about
apple
percent
about

and
only
percent
about
microsoft
how
do
a
company
once
at
the
forefront
of
technology
and
change
fall
so
far
behind
it
s
a
thorny
question
with
root
that
go
back
decade
but
i
believe
it
boil
down
to
three
broad
factor
scale
culture
and
leadership
the
obvious
answer
be
that
microsoft
get
huge
and
fail
to
deal
with
the
consequence
when
i
left
the
company
it
have
few
than
five
hundred
employee
by
there
be
more
than
five
thousand
by
nearly
forty
thousand
today
more
than
ninety
thousand
at
that
scale
cultural
change
creep
in
unless
you
guard
zealously
against
them
to
avoid
mediocrity
you
need
to
be
rigorous
about
weed
out
underperformer
microsoft
hasn
t
proven
to
be
good
at
that
one
executive
recently
told
me
i
wish
i
could
shoot
every
fourth
one
most
of
all
an
industry
leader
can
never
get
complacent
it
wasn
t
so
long
ago
that
microsoft
stood
by
the
slogan
that
bill
and
i
follow
at
the
start
we
set
the
standard
but
there
be
no
one
in
redmond
speak
privately
and
candidly
who
would
make
that
claim
today
during
and
i
have
lunch
with
more
than
a
dozen
people
who
have
recently
left
the
company
they
all
say
the
same
thing
too
many
semicompetent

a
punch
line
for
pundit
and
a
fat
target
for

mock
apple
ad
campaign
how
could
microsoft
allow
this
to
happen
to
its
signature
commodity
like
any
debacle
of
this
magnitude
vista
be
the
result
of
multiple
blunder
begin
with
its
overly
ambitious
scope
it
didn
t
help
that
the
window
code
base
have
grown
more
complex
to
test
and
upgrade
even
as
the
company
lose
much
of
its
season
leadership
still
a
big
part
of
the
problem
boil
down
to
basic
oversight
top
management
fail
to
pay
enough
attention
to
vista
s
development
and
then
allow
it
to
be
ship
when
the

deeply
flaw
microsoft
bounce

sergeant

steven
sinofsky
to
manage
the

of

but
the
company
s
broader
cultural

may
be
harder
to
fix
when
we

our

then
gui

microsoft
have
never
stop

in
the
three
decade
since
to
compete
in
that
arena
and
continue
to
make
inroad
today
but
it
could
be
argue
that
it
be
never
the

forte
to
design

that
make
the
consumer
s
heart
beat
faster
that
history
be
currently
reflect
at
microsoft
in
the
tension
between
sell
to
the
end
user

sell
to
what

as
the

another

primarily
from

as
a
result
microsoft
inevitably
tilt
its

toward
the

away
from

the

still

when

you
may
want

it
can
be

microsoft

in
the
early

we
overlook

have
the

opportunity
not

microsoft
might
have
be
a
footnote
in
operating

have
charles

not

we
could
easily
have

no

how

a

the

the

we

only

i
don
t
think
it

a

touch

smartphones

have
obvious
limitation
notably
for
multiuser

like
me
who
prefer
physical
keyboard
a

isn
t
as
capable

convenient
as
a

for
create

the

be
unsurpassed

ease
of
consumption
in
watch
web

or
reading
magazine
with
a
swipe
of
a

because
there
be
many
more
consumer
than
creator
in
our
culture
the
swiss
army
knife
strength
of
the
ipad
and
the
come
horde
of
ipad
clone
may
outweigh
its
limitation
it
appear
that
tablet
be
poise
to
render
physical
book
magazine
and
newspaper
obsolete
within
the
next
twenty
year
as
an
inveterate
book
lover
i
find
the
prospect
sad
but
inevitable
against
this
swirl
of
change
we
need
to
keep
in
mind
that
pc
have
average
double
digit
growth
over
the
last
decade
and
as
long
as
there
be
pc
there
will
be
a
microsoft
they
aren
t
about
to
be
supplant
by
smartphones
for
intensive
office
application
like
sale
report
or
spreadsheet
everywhere
else
however
people
be
shift
from
desktop
and
laptop
to
more
portable
mobile
device
as
technology
evolve
consumer
especially
young
consumer
get
pull
along
with
them
i
often
hear
people
say
i
don
t
like
it
personally
but
my
kid
be
perfectly
happy
type
on
their
iphone
new
product
resonate
at
first
with
early
adopter
who
want
the
next
hot
item
but
once
those
product
be
acknowledge
to
be
more
useful
than
what
come
before
their
consumer
net
quickly
widens
until
your
grandmother
be
signing
up
for
her

data
plan
brand
loyalty
be
forgotten
as
a

shove
aside
the
old
although
the

still
have
its
place
it
be
no
longer
the
prime
driver
of
innovation
here
s
what
the
death
knell
for
the
personal
computer
will
sound
like
mainly
i
use
my
phone
pad
but
i
still
use
my
pc
to
write
long
e
mail
and
document
most
people
aren
t
there
yet
but
that
s
where
we
re
head
if
microsoft
fails
to
catch
up
in
mobile
in
other
word
it
s
in
for
a
long
slow
slide
like
the
ibm
the
innovative
system
of
its
time
microsoft
window
have
enjoy
an
extraordinary
run
at
the
top
twenty
year
and
counting
an
eon
in
technology
and
like
big
blue
in
microsoft
now
face
a
major
threat
for
a
long
time
ibm
seem
smug
and
unassailable
counting
money
from
its
corporate
client
base
and
then
the
behemoth
stir
and
say
we
ve
get
to
have
a
pc
i
be
there
i
saw
how
ibm
go
from
nowhere
in
personal
computer
to
number
one
in
a
matter
of
month
with
a
fortuitous
assist
from
two
young
men
and
their
team
in
seattle
still
it
s
not
easy
to
come
from
behind
once
you
ve
cede
momentum
it
s
so
much
more
challenge
to
be
avis
than
hertz
you
need
to
do
more
than
try
harder
you
need
to
be
well
or
at
least
markedly
different
in
the
way
you
meet
people
s
need
if
a
microsoft
renaissance
have
ground
for
hope
and
i
believe
it
do
it
s
that
market
in
technology
be
inherently
dynamic
and
that
my
old
company
have
woken
up
to
the
challenge
the
smart
phone
market
will
stay
fragment
for
the
foreseeable
future
and
it
s
still
relatively
cheap
and
easy
for
people
to
switch
to
something
that
catch
their
eye
five
year
ago
before
anyone
have
heard
of
the
iphone

analyst
dripped
with
pessimism
about
that
company
s
future
give
microsoft
s
deep
cash
reserve
and
its
willingness
to
use
them
it
could
be
in
a
much
strong
position
five
year
from
now
but
to
take
on
apple
and
android
whose
phone
won
t
stop
get
well
microsoft
need
a
strategy
to
win
a
quicker
development
cycle
a
qualitatively
well
mobile
operating
system
and
a
secret
sauce
or
two
to
set
window
smartphones
apart
above
all
the
company
need
somehow
to
return
to
its
cut
edge
root
in
the
early
day
from
the
time
we
squeeze

into

thousand

no

i
believe
it
could
be
best
of
breed
to
win
the
mobile
war
the
company
need
first
and
foremost
to
produce
phone
and
slate
that
consumer
will
love
from
the
moment
they
use
them
i
left
microsoft
a
quarter
century
before
bill
do
and
we
ve
both
have
our
signal
triumph
since
then
but
in
certain
respect
neither
of
us
have
be
quite
as
good
alone
as
we
be
together
i
miss
bill

laser
focus
on
competition
in
the
marketplace
his
ability
to
execute
my
idea
and
keep
me
from
get
too
far
ahead
of
what
be
doable

like
to

my

divine
where
technology
be
head
and
my
knack
for
meeting
its
trajectory
with
something
big
and
original
in
my
post
microsoft
year
i
discover
how
challenge
it
be
to
operate
without
a
pragmatic
partner
and
business
maven
even
so
i
have
no
regret
about
take
my
own
road
it
have
lead
me
to
rich
experience
in
a
great
range
of
pursuit
to
the
life
i
d
always
dream
of
even
back
in
the
early
day

figure

would
outperform
just
about
anything

i

my

won

i
sat
at
the

played
the

memory
of
try

way
way
up
there
i
fare
well
on

at

where
you
hand
serve
a
large
rubber
ball
into

i
like
to
compete

my
modest
athletic

didn
t
flower
until
high
school

i
have
little
exposure
to
the

before

move

coincide
with
the
seattle
supersonics
stretch
run
to
its
first

last

i
get
caught
up
in
the
excitement

become
a
big
fan
in
june
after
the

finish
off
the

for
the

i
be
out
among
the
people
throng
the

honk
their

the
next
fall
i
bought
my
first

ticket
the
supersonics
begin
trading
away
their
talent
and
each
year
the

get
a
little
bad
and
my

get
a
little
well
until
i

courtside
across
from
the
home
bench
sit
so
close
deepen
my
passion
for
the

i
thought
the
nba
be
the
great
spectacle
in
sport
equal
part
athleticism
ballet
teamwork
and
individual
grit
the
action
be
almost
nonstop
full

few
game
be
decide
with
more
than
five

what
could
match
the
beauty
of
a
pure
jump
shot
swish
through
the
net
or
a
tough
offensive
rebound
in

the
sonics
of
the
early
eighty
weren
t
a
great
team

they
be
competitive

entertain
when
i
get
sick
they
become
my
escape
i
go
to
every
game
i
could

caught

study
box

you
ask
about

i
could
rattle
it
off
within
a
few

the

be
a
godsend
in
get
me
through
that
difficult
time
no
matter
how
rotten
i
felt
there
be
always
the
next
game
to
look
forward
to
in
the
fall
of
i
heard
that

an
offer
they
insist
that

if
word
leak
out
our
discussion

about

glory
of

rise
franchise
with
top
local
tv
rating
and
sellout
for
ten
consecutive

way
out
i
look
at
bob
and
say
they
didn
t
give
us
a
price
i
thought
the
deal
be
dead
but
then
in
march
they
call
i
still
have
the
itch
to
own
a
team
and
this
time
i
met
with
larry
face
to
face
for
two
hour
he
told
us
his
story
how
the
blazer
won
the
title
the
year
after
he
d
become
majority
owner
but
then
walton
broke
his
foot
and
they
d
never
recover
he
d
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
on
some
overseas
business
trip
and
listen
over
a
radio
feed
for
two
and
a
half
hour
and
the
next
day
be
ruin
if
his
team
hadn
t
won
the
lose
start
to
tear
your
gut
out
he
say
as
we
wrap
up
weinberg
say
he
would
take
million
ten
minute
later
we
have
a
handshake
deal
i
be
thirty
five
year
old
and
the
young
owner
in
major
league
sport
in
may
i
attend
a
medium
conference
at
the
trail
blazer
office
my
first
time
on
the
bright
red
team
color
carpeting
weinberg
say
i
would
like
to
introduce
you
to
the
new
owner
of
the
team
paul
allen
everyone
be
surprised
we
d
be
discreet
as
promise
this
level
of
public
exposure
be
new
to
me
and
i
felt
nervous
about
meeting
the
press
but
weinberg
be
extremely
gracious
he
make
it
clear
that
he
wouldn
t
have
sell
unless
he
d
found
the
right
person
for
the
team
s
future
success
i
be
first
of
all
a
fan
weinberg
told
the
reporter
unless
you
re
a
fan
nothing
else
count
in
this
ownership
early
on
i
met
clyde
drexler
the
team
s
superstar
and
we
hit
it
off
clyde
be
sharp
and
candid
a
free
spirit
on
the
surface
but
with
a
calculate
edge
underneath
i
d
heard
that
he
and
kiki
vandeweghe
clashed
with
coach
mike
schuler
a
brittle
disciplinarian
before
the
season
start
that
fall
the
two
player
ask
to
see
me
i
have
them
to
my
house
on
mercer
island
just
outside
seattle
and
i
should
have
know
well
we
d
barely
sat
down
when
the
coach
bashing
begin
schuler
be
a
control
freak
who
kill
the
player
creativity
and
so
on
toward
six
o
clock
clyde
say
hey
paul
we
saw
your
basketball
court
on
the
way
down
do
you
ever
use
it
in
fact
i
d
be
spending
a
fair
amount
of
time
polish
my
jump
shot
i
even
have
three
point
range
in
those
day
we
shot
around
and
then
kiki
say
let
s
play
h
o
r
s
e
i
agree
assume
i
d
get
cream
but
the
player
be
polite
enough
to
stick
mostly
to
three
pointer
and
i
hung
in
there
it
begin
to
drizzle
and
we
turn
on
the
light
whenever
a
stray
shot
bounce
off
the
court
clyde
and
kiki
race
across
the
slick
mesh
surface
to
grab
the
ball
maybe
this
wasn
t
such
a
good
idea
i
thought
what
if
somebody
get
hurt
after
i
make
the
game
clinch
three
pointer
they
d
go
easy
on
me
clyde
say
hey
i
want
to
dunk
kiki
toss
the
ball
in
the
air
and
clyde
take
a
flat
foot
leap
from
under
the
basket
he
be
twenty
six
year
old
in
his
prime
and
he
met
the
ball
maybe
three
foot
over
the
ten
foot
rim
caught
it
dunked
it
i
ve
sat
courtside
at
more
than
a
thousand
nba
game
but
i
ve
never
see
anything
quite
like
that
soar
slam
in
the
dark
in
the
rain
on
my
own
outdoor
court
on
his
way
out
clyde
say
casually
can
i
call
you
sometime
to
talk
about
the
team
of
course
i
say
that
be
my
second
rookie
mistake
it
s
fine
to
be
friendly
with
your
player
and
to
care
about
them
but
you
have
to
be
careful
about
cross
the
line
get
too
close
and
it
may
come
back
to
bite
you
when
it
s
time
to
renew
a
contract
or
weigh
a
trade
in
clyde
s
case
i
get
too
close
for
year
afterward
i
d
be
awaken
by
the
phone
in
the
middle
of
the
night
paul
it
s
clyde
i
d
say
who
else
would
be
call
me
at
three
a
m
how
s
it
go
clyde
and
he
d
say
we
lose
again
he
d
complain
about
a
teammate
who
kept
forget
the
play
like
most
of
us
clyde
be
well
at
see
others
flaw
than
his
own
we
d
chat
about
the
game
until
he
get
to
the
point
paul
it
s
just
not
fair
what
i
m
be
paid
shortly
before
i
bought
the
team
larry
weinberg
have
sign
drexler
to
a
six
year
contract
average
million
a
year
the
deal
make
him
one
of
the
best
paid
player
in
the
game
but
then
salary
escalate
sharply
and
clyde
s
have
lag
behind
paul
he
d
say
i
m
only
the
sixth
best
paid
player
on
the
team
you
know
that
isn
t
right
and
i
d
say
but
clyde
you
sign
a
contract
nobody
force
you
to
sign
the
contract
we
d
go
back
and
forth
beating
each
other
up
until
i
d
plead
exhaustion
and
hang
up
the
phone
there
be
no
simple
resolution
on
the
one
hand
clyde
do
deserve
more
money
he
have
that
special
extra
gear
the
turbo
he
call
it
that
you
see
only
in
the
great
player
and
he
d
won
a
lot
of
big
game
for
us
on
the
other
hand
i
thought
a
deal
be
a
deal
it
seem
both
illogical
and
a
terrible
precedent
to
tear
up
a
contract
just
because
a
player
have
my
home
number
a
year
or
so
after
i
become
owner
my
tie
to
clyde
affected
my
judgment
and
change
the
course
of
two
franchise
bucky
buckwalter
an
executive
under
general
manager
geoff
petrie
brought
me
a
blockbuster
trade
i
think
we
can
get
olajuwon
for
clyde
he
say
akeem
later
hakeem
olajuwon
be
one
of
the
top
two
or
three
center
in
the
game
i
subscribed
to
the
axiom
that
you
always
trade
a
small
player
for
a
big
one
of
like
talent
but
this
time
i
told
bucky
to
pas
i
have
concern
about
olajuwon
s
long
term
health
after
doctor
have
found
a
blood
clot
in
his
leg
the
condition
turn
out
to
be
treatable
but
the
other
reason
i
held
back
be
that
clyde
be
special
to
the
team
and
its
tradition
but
also
to
me
personally
i
didn
t
want
to
see
him
go

the
trail
blazer
struggle
that
first
year
after
word
filter
out
that
the
team
s
black
player
felt
alienate
from
the
coach
staff
we
hire
maurice
lucas
a
respect
star
from
the
walton
year
as
an
assistant
coach
but
issue
still
fester
to
the
point
where
sport
illustrate
depict
the
blazer
as
a
team
rife
with
turmoil
i
sent
bert
on
a
midseason
road
trip
and
he
come
back
with
a
sober
report
the
team
be
split
into
ten
and
two
with
clyde
and
kiki
the
two
everyone
hat
the
coach
whom
clyde
be
do
his
level
best
to
undermine
schuler
respond
with
a
bunker
mentality
he
d
schedule
meeting
with
his
staff
and
forget
to
tell
maurice
lucas
he
be
freeze
lucas
out
i
wasn
t
keen
about
disrupt
the
team
with
a
midseason
coach
change
but
the
division
seem
irreparable
in
february
we
fire
schuler
and
replace
him
with
rick
adelman
then
a
little
know
assistant
kiki
ask
to
be
trade
and
we
packed
him
off
to
the
knicks
end
a
controversy
over
play
time
with
the
young
more
dynamic
jerome
kersey
after
get
swept
out
of
the
first
round
of
the
playoff
by
the
los
angeles
lakers
the
team
s
need
be
obvious
the
blazer
be
strong
on
the
perimeter
with
clyde
kersey
and
point
guard
terry
porter
but
thin
up
front
with
the
oft
injured
sam
bowie
miss
most
of
the
season
we
have
a
short
arm
center
in
kevin
duckworth
and
a
hole
at
power
forward
team
score
on
us
inside
at
will
i
ve
try
to
strike
a
balance
as
team
owner
to
be
involve
and
accountable
while
preserve
my
executive
freedom
to
shape
the
roster
my
job
be
oversight
not
execution
while
i
sign
off
on
trade
or
free
agent
i
ve
rarely
overrule
my
basketball
people
s
decision
but
i
m
not
shy
about
steer
the
discussion
or
push
deeper
if
something
doesn
t
make
sense
to
me
shortly
before
the
nba
draft
my
first
as
a
real
participant
i
attend
an
all
star
game
for
top
college
player
my
eye
be
drawn
to
cliff
robinson
a
wiry
six
ten
center
from
the
university
of
connecticut
with
a
constant
scowl
on
his
face
on
tape
he
look
like
a
smooth
and
explosive
athlete
who
could
really
shoot
my
favorite
combination
but
cliff
have
a
reputation
as
a
surly
kid
who
didn
t
play
hard
on
draft
day
i
sat
in
our
war
room
and
scan
the
board
that
ranked
our
top
prospect
as
the
second
round
begin
cliff
be
the
only
one
left
in
the
greenroom
where
project
lottery
pick
wait
to
take
the
stage
as
their
name
be
call
he
be
so
hurt
that
he
left
and
go
back
to
his
hotel
by
then
i
be
lobbying
hard
to
choose
him
second
round
pick
be
low
risk
proposition
their
contract
aren
t
always
guaranteed
and
they
can
be
easily
cut
if
they
don
t
pan
out
bucky
buckwalter
who
lean
toward
long
athletic
player
give
his
assent
with
little
to
lose
geoff
petrie
agree
to
take
a
flier
on
cliff
that
draft
taught
me
how
quickly
a
team
s
fortune
can
change
with
one
or
two
good
decision
buck
williams
newly
acquire
in
a
trade
for
bowie
be
the
ideal
addition
to
our
start
lineup
tough
focus
a
pillar
of
strength
against
large
player
like
utah
s
karl
malone
cliff
be
rangy
fast
and
defense
mind
capable
of
play
three
position
another
perfect
fit
he
d
be
name
the
league
s
top
sixth
man
in
and
an
all
star
the
follow
year
together
they
help
vault
the
trail
blazer
from
a
lose
record
to
second
best
in
the
league
that
squad
be
unselfish
and
relentless
and
it
be
a
privilege
to
watch
them
after
we
beat
the
celtic
by
thirteen
point
in
boston
garden
red
auerbach
say
they
just
ran
us
right
out
of
our
gym
there
s
a
special
bond
in
city
with
a
single
major
league
franchise
i
d
heard
about
blazermania
come
in
but
i
didn
t
know
just
how
rabid
the
portland
fan
could
be
our
run
that
season
unleashed
a
wave
of
pent
up
fervor
we
swept
dallas
in
the
first
round
of
the
playoff
and
then
cliff
set
the
tone
against
san
antonio
by
sub
for
the
injured
duckworth
and
hold
the
great
david
robinson
to
nine
point
then
come
the
western
conference
final
against
the
high
score
phoenix
sun
though
i
m
not
demonstrative
by
nature
i
get
caught
up
in
the
collective
emotion
of
that
series
to
the
point
where
i
be
signal
three
point
shot
and
wave
the
crowd
to
stand
and
cheer
down
the
stretch
i

their

after
we
pull
out
the
clincher
on
the
road
by
three
point
i
get
so
carry
away
that
i
ran
out
to
join
the
scrum
of
player
on
the
court
when
buck
williams
embrace
me
it
felt
like
get
hug
by
a
brick
wall
our
magical
ride
finally
end
in
the
nba
final
when
the
bad
boy
piston
use
their
experience
and
toughness
and
the
timely
shoot
of
vinnie
microwave
johnson
to
defeat
us
in
five
game
we
return
to
the
final
in
the
come
out
party
for
michael
jordan
s
chicago
bull
head
into
the
showdown
a
sport
illustrate
cover
story
feature
the
player
who
d
finish
one
two
in
the
balloting
for
most
valuable
player
that
year
jordan
and
drexler
who
be
bill
as
jordan
s
no
rival
that
only
stoke
jordan
s
competitive
fire
which
never
need
stoke
in
the
first
place
bad
yet
clyde
have
to
guard
the
league
s
top
scorer
without
his
normal
lateral
movement
after
arthroscopic
surgery
the
previous
september
he
d
have
his
right
knee
drain
half
a
dozen
time
jordan
be
a
streaky
jump
shooter
at
that
stage
of
his
career
make
only
percent
of
his
three
point
shot
during
the
season
but
in
game
one
in
chicago
he
hit
six
of
them
in
the
first
half
on
his
way
to
point
after
the
last
deep
shot
he
turn
toward
the
broadcast
table
and
shrug
as
if
he
d
surprised
even
himself
we
try
cliff
and
jerome
on
him
along
with
clyde
all
solid
defender
but
it
make
no
difference
jordan
have
his
turbo
on
i
ve
see
just
one
other
person
up
close
who
compare
to
him
who
want
not
only
to
beat
you
but
to
crush
you
if
he
could
those
two
stood
apart
for
raw
competitiveness
michael
jordan
and
bill
gate
we
have
our
moment
against
the
bull
midway
through
the
fourth
quarter
of
a
tight
game
four
in
portland
clyde
tapped
the
ball
away
from
jordan
and
convert
it
into
a
dunk
set
off
a
surge
that
even
the
series
at
two
game
apiece
nearly
giddy
i
go
into
the
locker
room
afterward
and
found
clyde
slump
in
front
of
his
locker
completely
exhaust
an
ice
bag
on
every
joint
and
i
say
clyde
that
be
a
brilliant
steal
you
read
jordan
perfectly
he
look
up
at
me
shook
his
head
and
say
stop
stop
you
don
t
understand
most
guy
have
two
or
three
go
to
move
jordan
have
nine
i
guess
right
that
s
all
i
get
lucky
sometimes
you
get
the
bear
but
usually
the
bear
get
you
clyde
knew
the
score
the
bull
on
the
cusp
of
a
dynasty
beat
us
in
six
game
just
around
that
time
to
compensate
for
those
year
when
clyde
be
paid
below
the
market
i
give
him
a
million
one
season
extension
then
the
big
yearly
paycheck
in
the
history
of
team
sport
i
thought
he
d
earn
it
though
we
never
won
a
title
in
the
drexler
era
those
be
glorious
year
i
watch
up
to
three
hundred
game
a
season
live
and
on
tv
in
remote
locale
like
hawaii
i
have
a
special
live
satellite
feed
when
the
blazer
come
on
when
i
be
home
in
seattle
i
d
invite
six
or
eight
people
to
fly
to
portland
for
each
home
game
my
mother
become
one
of
our
big
fan
and
she
d
bring
a
friend
and
drink
her
tea
and
eat
her
cooky
en
route
then
she
d
sit
with
me
on
the
baseline
and
scold
the
referee
in
her
dignify
fashion
you
ve
get
to
call
it
the
same
way
on
both
side
she
d
say
as
the
near
official
roll
his
eye
for
my
mom
bad
whistle
be
injustice
and
she
wasn
t
go
to
sit
by
and
not
say
anything
one
night
we
be
play
the
sonics
and
sam
perkins
six
nine
and
pound
barrel
after
a
ball
that
be
sail
out
of
bound
straight
over
my
mother
s
head
she
threw
up
her
hand
as
perkins
crashed
into
her
and
then
i
notice
her
hold
her
wrist
it
s
broken
she
say
calmly
at
halftime
the
team
doctor
iced
and
taped
it
and
i
ask
if
she
want
to
head
home
no
she
say
firmly
we
re
go
to
watch
the
rest
of
the
game
over
ensue
season
adelman
tie
our
young
player
to
the
bench
and
stuck
with
the
tight
rotation
of
veteran
who
have
gotten
us
to
the
final
but
you
can
t
freeze
time
and
those
guy
be
now
on
the
downside
in
we
hire
a
new
coach
p
j
carlesimo
plus
a
new
team
president
and
general

next
decade
articulate

and
deceptively
bland
bob
whitsitt
have
join
the
seattle
supersonics
in
at
age
thirty
he
be
the
young
top
executive
in
the
league
know
as
trader
bob
for
his
nonstop
personnel
move
he
built
a
powerhouse
team
around
gary
payton
a
pugnacious
point
guard
and
shawn
kemp
a
wildly
talented
big
man
who
d
never
played
in
college
those
sonics
team
be
bold
volatile
swagger
and
athletically
gift
in
they
post
a
record
of
best
in
the
league
whitsitt
be
name
nba
executive
of
the
year
but
his
owner
barry
ackerley
become
disenchant
after
the
team
get
upset
in
the
playoff
ackerley
disconnect
whitsitt
s
office
phone
to
encourage
him
to
resign
i
jumped
to
hire
him
clyde
be
promptly
trade
to
the
houston
rocket
as
he
d
request
i
give
my
favorite
player
the
news
and
thanked
him
for
his
contribution
and
it
be
an
emotional
moment
for
us
both
that
spring
i
root
for
him
from
afar
as
he
help
olajuwon
win
a
title
i
d
always
consider
clyde
a
champion
and
now
it
be
official
whitsitt
proceed
to
overhaul
our
age
roster
as
he
d
do
in
seattle
draft
young
athlete
with
upside
and
add
big
name
veteran
a
few
of
his
move
be
brilliant
like
the
six
for
one
deal
that
brought
us
jordan
s
all
star
sidekick
scottie
pippen
just
one
year
remove
from
the
last
of
his
six
championship
with
the
bull
but
there
be
too
many
time
when
whitsitt
operate
like
a
rotisserie
league
gm
pile
up
player
with
gaudy
number
he
openly
profess
that
he
care
only
about
talent
to
the
exclusion
of
character
and
other
intangible
i
didn
t
take
chemistry
in
college
he
told
the
medium
with
enough
physical
ability
on
the
floor
team
cohesion
would
take
care
of
itself
it
be
a
risky
assumption
for
a
sport
in
which
five
men
share
one
ball
with
hindsight
whitsitt
temporarily
stave
off
decline
by
use
my
wallet
to
load
up
on
pricey
long
term
contract
player
who
be
available
because
they
be
overpaid
or
have
off
court
issue
or
both
over
a
span
of
seven
year
he
would
draft
sign
or
trade
for
rasheed
wallace
isaiah
rider
damon
stoudamire
bonzi
well
shawn
kemp
ruben
patterson
qyntel
wood
and
zach
randolph
any
one
of
them
would
have
be
a
handful
despite
the
presence
of
some
notable
good
guy
like
arvydas
sabonis
and
steve
smith
they
become
know
as
the
portland
jail
blazer
how
could
i
tolerate
this
stew
of
instability
the
short
answer
be
that
we
kept
win
over
the
last
six
year
of
whitsitt
s
tenure
the
blazer
won
percent
of
their
game
fourth
best
in
the
league
we
make
the
playoff
each
year
and
twice
reach
the
conference
final
enough
success
to
give
me
pause
about
shake
up
the
organization
i
can
be
patient
to
a
fault
and
whitsitt
have
his
strength
he
be
plug
into
the
player
agent
network
like
nobody
else
and
i
count
on
his
connection
to
get
deal
do
he
be
also
a
great
rationalizer
when
i
d
ask
why
a
draft
pick
fizzle
or
a
trade
backfire
he
d
respond
just
watch
next
year
he
s
go
to
be
so
much
well
when
you
come
so
close
to
win
a
championship
as
we
have
in
the
early
ninety
it
make
you
that
much
hungrier
because
you
know
what
the
final
taste
like
it
be
the
same
for
whitsitt
who
be
desperate
to
validate
his
approach
with
a
title
we
be
perpetually
one
big
salaried
veteran
away
from
contention
and
our
payroll
balloon
deep
down
i
knew
that
something
be
wrong
in
the
playoff
when
the
pressure
peak
and
high
caliber
opponent
target
your
weakness
a
player
s
makeup
be
reveal
in
performance
in
the
western
conference
final
against
the
lakers
we
fell
behind
three
game
to
one
and
then
fought
back
to
earn
a
decide
seventh
game
up
fifteen
point
in
the
final
quarter
it
look
as
though
we
be
head
to
the
nba
final
against
indiana
whom
i
thought
we
could
beat
when
i
watch
my
team
in
the
playoff
i
get
superstitious
i
try
not
to
think
about
how
much
i
want
to
win
whatever
happens
i
ll
be
fine
with
it
the
player
try
their
best
but
in
that
fourth
quarter
i
succumbed
i
couldn
t
deny
it
i
really
want
to
beat
the
lakers
within
minute
the
blazer
unraveled
we
miss
thirteen
consecutive
shot
our
player
suddenly
look
as
though
they
d
met
for
the
first
time
that
morning
the
coup
de
gr
ce
come
when
shaquille
o
neal
dunked
an
alley
oop
from
kobe
bryant
with
forty
second
left
that
seventh
game
expose
us
as
a
team
without
leadership
or
discipline
i
ll
never
forget
the
feel
i
have
when
we
board
our
plane
still
festoon
with
beat
la
sticker
and
head
home
our
season
do
it
be
a
crush
defeat
and
it
take
me
a
long
long
time
to
get
over
it
in
eight
year
after
whitsitt
s
arrival
we
fell
into
the
abyss
we
lead
the
league
in
payroll
at
million
million
more
than
the
championship
lakers
we
be

and

the

which
have

an
outrageous
million
all
for
a

would
lose
yet
again
in
the

round
of

it

one
of
my
favorite
day
of
the

i
begin
prepare
week
ahead
of
time
pore
over
our
five
hundred

and
watch
hour
of

the
day
before
the
big
event
i
convene
with
our
personnel
guy
in
portland
to
watch
more
film
and
hear
from

then
we
head
to
a
restaurant
to
hash
out
player
ranking
over
dinner
in
the

lottery
we
start
with
some
bad
luck
despite
our
nba
bad
record
we
be
pick
fourth
by
then
we
d
hand
the
operation

to
kevin
pritchard
who
have
a
good
gut
for

meanwhile
we
get
word
about
a
rangy
uw
guard
name
brandon
roy
who
didn
t
look
all
that
impressive
on
videotape
but
in
a
private
workout
he
be
big
quicker
and
more
explosive
than
we
d
expect
after
some
draft
day
maneuver
we
wound
up
with
both
brandon
and
lamarcus
aldridge
the
skilled
big
man
out
of
texas
that
i
covet
two
young
men
of
unquestioned
character
that
be
a
banner
night
for
us
a
turn
point
for
the
franchise
shortly
after
the

i
pull
the

off
the

the
next
february
literally
minute
before
the

be
set
to

in

the

agree
to
a

an
era
that
none

us
would
miss
the
follow
season
we
have
the
young
team
in
the
league
and
not
a
single
arrest
or
suspension
the
culture
have
change
and
it
be
my
pleasure
to
invite
the
blazer
to
mercer
island
for
practice
on
easter
sunday
after
a
light
run
through
coach
nate
mcmillan
say
he
would
end
practice
early
if
i
could

on

the

play
from
brandon

lamarcus
and
unselfish
teamwork
all
around
the
trail

share
a
division
title
and
return
to
the
nba
playoff
for
the
first
time
in
six
year
we
lose
a
tough
first
round

you
wouldn

it
from

with

i

approach
by
a
contingent
of
local
politician
on
the
hunt
for
a
buyer
to
keep
the
team
in
seattle
i
like
football
but
i
didn
t
plant
myself
in
front
of
the
tv
all
day
sunday
and
i
wasn
t
on
a
quest
to
take
on
a
second
major
league
team
and
all
the
responsibility
that
come
with
it
still
i
be
sympathetic
i
go
to
four
or
five
seahawks
game
a
year
i
thought
of
seattle
as
a
three
sport
city
and
i
knew
how
hard
it
be
to
retrieve
a
major
league
franchise
once
a
community
lose
one
in
april
i
agree
to
a
million
option
to
buy
the
team
within
fifteen
month
for
approximately
million
i
have
one
stipulation
i
would
exercise
my
option
only
if
we
could
get
a
new
stadium
base
on
my
experience
with
the
blazer
it
make
no
sense
to
get
involve
unless
revenue
could
cover
the
cost
of
resign
top
player
and
pursue
the
best
free
agent
you
need
a
first
class
facility
to
generate
that
kind
of
money
and
the
kingdome
be
grossly
inadequate
a
new
stadium
would
run
million
and
i
be
willing
to
chip
in
close
to
a
third
of
it
but
the
rest
have
to
come
from
public
funding
not
just
to
give
me
a
fight
chance
to
make
a
modest
profit
but
to
forge
a
public
private
partnership
that
would
keep
the
franchise
in
seattle
for
the
long
haul
regardless
of
who
own
it
my
hometown
have
ask
for
help
and
i
want
to
respond
but
i
wasn
t
about
to
go
it
alone
the
day
after
i
negotiate
my
purchase
option
the
seattle
time
ran
a
story
headline
allen
s
rescue
make
him
city
s
late
great
sport
superhero
i
guess
that
it
wouldn
t
be
long
before
the
medium
change
its
tune
in
a
december
seattle
time

i

people

guy
who
d
cofounded

who
now
might
save
the

as
the
six
week
campaign
over

unfolded
i
be
surprised
by
how
many
people
still
like
the
kingdome
while
city
like

constantly
tear
down

revitalize
seattleites
cherish
their

icon
even
the
unsightly

we
emphasize
the

we
be
make
headway
in
the

and
have
pull
almost
even
when
oppose
group
found
traction
with
a
superficially
convincing
argument
there
be
no
need
to
vote
yes
on
the

they
maintain
because
i
d
never
walk
away
and
let
the

leave

political
cartoon
struck
the
same
theme
why
doesn
t
paul
just
pay
for
all
of
it
since
he
can
our
poll
number
drop
it
look
like
my
wealth
be
work
against
me
as
a
seattle
time
columnist
write
mr
allen
be
a
splendid
fellow
whose
only
drawback
may
be
that
he
have
too
much
money
i
knew
about
voter
resistance
firsthand
from
the
seattle
common
project
where
we
d
push
for
a
sixty
one
acre
waterfront
park
to
anchor
industrial
and
biotech
development
in
the
south
lake
union
neighborhood
despite
my
pledge
of
million
the
voter
twice
defeat
our
proposal
we
ve
continued
to
revitalize
south
lake
union
but
without
the
park
now
i
put
aside
my
aversion
to
tv
appearance
and
take
my
case
for
a
new
football
stadium
directly
to
the
voter
on
june
two
week
before
the
referendum
i
sat
in
a
stag
living
room
backdrop
and
taped
a
thirty
second
spot
when
i
say
yes
to
help
save
the
seahawks
i
meant
that
i
d
do
my
part
in
building
something
for
the
future
personally
and
financially
i
stand
by
that
commitment
but
if
you
say
no
that
mean
no
for
me
too
because
i
m
not
go
to
do
this
without
you
the
ad
seem
to
work
by
election
day
poll
show
us
with
a
narrow
lead
but
it
be
less
than
their
margin
of
error
and
nothing
be
assure
when
i
arrive
at
our
headquarters
that
night
i
could
feel
the
worry
early
return
from
eastern
washington
where
the
case
for
a
seattle
stadium
be
least
persuasive
be
bad
than
we
d
project
we
be
down
thirty
thousand
vote
if
the
ballot
fail
i
knew
there
be
a
good
chance
the
seahawks
would
leave
town
the
kingdome
would
become
a
white
elephant
actually
a
brownish
gray
elephant
host
the
occasional
truck
or
home
show
it
be
a
glum
prospect
all
around
we
be
banking
on
late
return
from
king
county
and
the
suburb
to
put
us
over
as
senator
warren
magnuson
once
say
about
washington
s
statewide
election
you
can
see
every
vote
that
matter
from
the
top
of
the
space
needle
every
few
minute
i
checked
in
we
be
still
behind
but
gain
by
ten
o
clock
it
be
clear
that
the
suburban
soccer
mom
have
turn
out
in
drove
by
eleven
we
knew
that
the
referendum
would
pas
in
a
squeaker
month
of
tension
drain
away
i
join
a
local
band
in
a
celebration
jam
and
bert
kolde
jumped
up
to
sing
wild
thing
i
could
see
how
people
get
addict
to
electioneer
and
on
top
of
it
all
i
be
about
to
join
the
small
and
special
club
of
nfl
owner
the
new
stadium
would
be
built
in
the
footprint
of
the
old
one
in
seattle
s
international
district
a
transportation
hub
with
restaurant
and
hotel
within
walk
distance
the
kingdome
s
destruction
be
slat
for
march
as
i
watch
from
three
hundred
yard
away
fifty
thousand
ton
of
concrete
would
be
demolish
by
a
rapid
fire
series
of
gelatin
dynamite
charge
the
large
implosion
in
history
espn
classic
cover
the
event
live
and
i
be
ask
if
i
want
to
push
the
button
that
would
set
the
whole
thing
off
i
wasn
t
sure
about
that
so
they
offer
plan
b
at
the
end
of
the
countdown
i
would
give
the
high
sign
to
the
demolition
man
and
he
would
push
the
button
ok
i
say
that
sound
like
fun
i
get
my
instruction
there
would
be
an
audible
count
over
a
pa
from
ten
down
to
six
then
a
silent
count
to
zero
the
logic
be
that
if
anybody
happen
to
be
inside
the
kingdome
and
ran
out
yell
we
need
to
be
able
to
hear
them
and
abort
the
blast
i
follow
the
audible
count
and
continued
it
in
my
head
there
be
an
awkward
pause
the
demolition
man
look
at
me
expectantly
his
hand
over
the
button
and
i
froze
i
can
t
explain
why
maybe
i
have
a
flash
of
nostalgia
for
all
the
supersonics
and
ncaa
final
four
game
i
d
see
at
the
kingdome
at
that
pregnant
moment
my
brain
just
lock
up
the
poor
demolition
guy
be
raise
his
eyebrow
at
me
can
we
blow
it
up
now
i
finally
snap
out
of
it
and
give
my
thumb
up
we
heard
what
sound
like
gigantic
firecracker
go
off
in
a
time
sequence
with
streak
of
light
flash
across
the
dome
then
the
building
implode
as
people
cheer
from
nearby
office
tower
within
second
all
that
remain
be
a
tight
mound
of
rubble
and
move
toward
us
at
highway
speed
a
billowing
cloud
of
dust
on
cue
we
jumped
into
a
van
until
it
pass
my
formative
experience
with
big
time
football
be
at
the
university
of
washington
where
my
father
and
i
sat
in
the
stand
and
stomp
on
the
riser
as
we
cheer
on
the
smashmouth
team
of
the
early
sixty
later
we
go
to
see
sonny
sixkiller
the
dynamic
cherokee
quarterback
who
lead
the
nation
in
passing
in
win
or
lose
there
be
a
special
feel
to
those
game
in
the
open
air
when
i
met
with
the
stadium
architect
i
talk
about
create
a
twenty
first
century
version
of
the
experience
i
love
as
a
boy
instead
of
an
insulate
bowl
in
a
parking
lot
i
want
an
open

design
and
seat
with
a
view
husky
stadium
look
out
on

have
expansive
vista
of
downtown
elliott

and
mount
rainier
because
our
winter
weather
be
rainy
i
ask
for
an
overhang
that
would
cantilever
over
the
low
deck
to
keep
fan
dry
and
bring
them
as
close
to
the
action
as
possible

be
the
first
nfl

with

behind

we
instal

to
recreate
the
kingdome
s
acoustic
and
deafen
crowd
noise
so
much
so
that
the
seahawks
be
perennially
among
the
league
leader
in
false
start
penalty
against
the
opposition

in

the
seahawks
end
a
ten
year
playoff
drought
and
won
a
division
title
but
then
we
hit
a
plateau
for
reason
that
seem
to
make
sense
at
the
time
i
kept
whitsitt
on
as

enough
to
counterbalance

why
we

word
on
the
mammoth
screen

wet
i
thought
about
my
father
the
man
who
d
taught
me
how
to
throw
a
tight
spiral
and
i
wish
he
could
have
be
at
my
side
as
i
pull
on
the
rope
the
intensity
of
the
crowd
s
response
amaze
me
i
lose
count
of
how
many
people
around
the
flagpole
thanked
me
for
keep
their
team
in
town
i
wave
a
white
towel
in
the
air
to
help
boost
the
frenzy
not
my
usual
style
it
be
the
most
passionate
public
celebration
i
ve
ever
be
part
of
back
up
in
my
suite
i
hopped
on
and
off
my
chair
pace
throughout
the
game
holmgren
have
told
me
that
he
d
be
call
one
of
his
rare
trick
play
with
backup
quarterback
seneca
wallace
as
wide
receiver
the
coach
s
trick
often
backfire
but
this
time
seneca
make
an
over
the
shoulder
catch
for
twenty
eight
yard
midway
through
the
first
quarter
set
up
our
first
touchdown
the
seahawks
never
look
back
hasselbeck
be
near
perfect
and
alexander
ran
roughshod
tatupu
make
an
early
interception
and
knock
the
panther
run
back
out
of
the
game
steve
smith
carolina
s
star
receiver
be
stop
cold
with
double
and
triple
team
with
the
score
mount
to
a
twenty
point
blowout
i
could
hardly
contain
myself
as
i
descend
to
the
field
for
the
last
few
minute
at
the
postgame
ceremony
holmgren
hasselbeck
and
i
stood
under
the
light
raise
the
nfc
championship
trophy
over
our
head
i
appreciate
what
the
coach
told
the
press
afterward
i
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
an
owner
who
have
be
patient
with
me
in
this
business
that
s
not
always
the
case
if
you
believe
in
something
and
you
stay
the
course
and
you
get
people
who
believe
in
you
it
give
you
a
chance
we
come
into
super
bowl
xl
as
four
point
underdog
to
the
pittsburgh
steelers
we
have
a
three
point
lead
early
but
be
hurt
by
some
questionable
officiate
that
isn
t
sour
grape
on
my
part
more
than
four
year
after
the
fact
the
game
s
referee
acknowledge
that
he
blew
two
pivotal
call
in
the
fourth
quarter
we
also
have
too
many
penalty
and
drop
pass
and
miss
field
goal
in
the
end
pittsburgh
be
tougher
and
more
poise
that
day
they
outplayed
us
when
it
count
you
re
always
sorely
disappointed
to
lose
a
super
bowl
because
who
know
when
you
ll
be
back
it
may
not
happen
in
my
lifetime
but
we
re
sure

to
me

the
point
of

a
major
league
franchise
the
seahawks
don
t
play
in
the

their
engine
like
the
german
junker

sort
out
how
a
rocket
motor

with
its
mix
of
technology
and
adventure
science
fiction
hold
a
natural
appeal
for
adolescent
boy

early
lakeside
year
i
d
spend
my
weekend
morning
lie
in

isaac
asimov

that
wonderful
stylist
and

heinlein
s
hard
science
fiction

pair
authentic
scientific
theory
with
ray
gun
battle
and
i
d
get
irk
by
author
whose
character
travel
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
which
i
knew
be
theoretically
impossible
a
quarter
century
after
i
d
left
home
i
go
up
to
my
old
room

would
you
believe
it
paul
a

give
me
seventy
five
dollar
it
be
hard
to
forgive
her

the
day
after
enlarge
the

tracked
down
and
retrieve
almost
all
of

me
to
wonder
about
parallel
universe
and
how
the
wild
idea
might
be
possible
some
of
those
notion

now
see
as
scientifically
unattainable
antigravity
warp
drive
or
financially
and
logistically
impractical

others
from

turn
out
to
be
sneak
preview
of
the

me
think
about
where

i
ve
try
to
repay
my
debt
by
opening
the

fix
a

to
one
end
with
a
lit
cherry
bomb
attach
if
we
time
it
just
right
the
cherry

would
explode
over
a

startle
the

and
send
us
dive
into
the

i
have

set
it
atop
a
coffee
pot
with
my

in
rapt
attendance
i
lit
the

shudder
before
topple
over
and
melt

instead
of
a

hot
because
the

ignite
until

burn
itself
out
without

kept
it
a

it
never
lose
my
interest
in
the
spring
of
in
the
middle
of
microsoft
s
frenetic
work
on

charles

suggest
that
we
fly
to
florida
for
the
maiden
launch
of
the
space
shuttle
columbia
neither
of
us
have
see
a

charles
have
miss
apollo
by
half
an
hour
after
make
a
wrong
turn
in
georgia
i
be
all
for
go
until
we
realize
that
the
launch
be
set
for
friday
april
the
date
for
microsoft
s
first
ever
companywide
meeting
instead
of
join
the
throng
at
the
kennedy
space
center
we
d
be
stuck
in
a
red
lion
inn
in
bellevue
then
some
kismet
the
launch
be
postpone
to
sunday
because
of
a
software
glitch
we
reach
the
nasa
causeway
before
dawn
at
seven
there
begin
a
deep
rumble
that
become
more
than
sound
until
the
air
be
literally
vibrate
we
could
see
the
orange
glow
as
the
rocket
fire
and
then
i
could
feel
its
heat
on
my
face
as
the
columbia
head
straight
up
and
the
crowd
chant
go
i
get

me
every

happy
that
we

take
the

off
with

s
deadline
still
pending
but
i
didn
t
second
guess
go
i
have
see
a
rare
thing
i
d
see
history
in
september
i
flew
to
mojave
california
to
meet
burt
rutan
president
of
scale
composite
and
the
renegade
genius
of
modern
aerospace
engineering
burt
be
tall
and
thick

in

a

of
silvery

muttonchop
sideburn
a
desert
tan
and
a
fanatic

glint
in
his
eye
he
d
design
more
than
thirty
unorthodox
experimental
aircraft
mostly
with
lightweight
carbon
composite
and
have
set
a
raft
of
world
distance
and
duration
record
in
his
voyager
become
the
first
plane
to
be
flown
around
the
world
without
land
or
refuel
burt
have
already
begin
think
about
a
supersonic
plane
that
could
fly
above
the
atmosphere
two
year
later
over
lunch
in
seattle
he
float
his
plan
for
a
man
rocket
flight
into
suborbital
space
burt
want
to
demonstrate
that
you
didn
t
need
nasa
level
resource
to
create
a
commercial
space
tourism
industry
and
bring
ordinary
people
to
the
same
black
sky
that
once
greet
alan
shepard
i
have
a
narrower
goal
i
want
to
do
something
in
rocketry
that
no
one
have
do
before
i
want
to
do
it
with
burt
because
none
of
his
design
have
crashed
during
test
in
government
fund
spaceflight
there
be
a
historical
percent
fatality
rate
for
space
tourism
to
succeed
that
risk
need
to
be
cut
to
no
more
than
one
in
five
thousand
comparable
to
the
early
airline
industry
burt
have
a
lot
go
for
him
a
crack
engineering
team
and
a
brilliant
body
of
work
plus
the
aura
of
confidence
that
mark
great
innovator
but
the
right
design
still
elude
him
and
so
our
project
be
table

in
burt
be
hire
as
a
flight
test
project
engineer
at
edward
air
force
base
just
south
of
mojave
the
place
where
chuck
yeager
first
broke
the
sound
barrier
burt
s
stay
overlap
with
the
government
s
research
program
for
the
x
the
only
wing
aircraft
to
fly
into
space
it
be
launch
not
from
the
ground
but
from
a
b
mother
ship
high
in
the
atmosphere
the
idea
be
to
avoid
the
most
dangerous
phase
of
a
ground
launch
the
first
second
when
there
s
no
way
to
abort
after
liftoff
without
create
a
fireball
if
a
rocket
start
instead
at
foot
and
then
something
go
wrong
you
can
dump
propellant
and
still
have
time
to
glide
down
for
a
safe
land
beyond
be
safer
the
two
plane
concept
avoid
the
conventional
one
and
do
missile
that
would
have
make
the
rocket
s
price
prohibitive
yet
another
plus
in
thinner
atmosphere
you
use
less
fuel
which
allows
for
a
small
rocket
but
if
the
go
up
seem
relatively
straightforward
the
come
down
be
something
else
again
in
during
burt
s
stint
at
edward
an
x
test
pilot
name
mike
adam
be
kill
during
reentry
after
a
spin
at
mach
five
time
the
speed
of
sound
broke
his
plane
into
piece
burt
be
commit
to
find
a
more
dependable
design
something
at
least
as
safe
as
nasa
s
mercury
model
where
the
astronaut
sat
inside
a
capsule
at
the
tip
of
a
missile
and
parachute
back
to
earth
his
first
big
idea
which
he
call
a
carefree
reentry
be
to
feather
the
capsule
like
a
badminton
shuttlecock
the
result
drag
would
decelerate
the
craft
faster
and
minimize
heat
buildup
as
it
return
to
the
atmosphere
but
the
capsule
shuttlecock
approach
have
drawback
you
couldn
t
land
the
spacecraft
without
a
parachute
and
you
couldn
t
market
flight
for
tourist
if
you
need
search
and
rescue
mission
to
find
errant
capsule
besides
parachute
mishap
be
all
too
common
a
russian
cosmonaut
die
in
the
first
soyuz
flight
in
after
his
chute
fail
burt
need
a
craft
that
could
reliably
survive
reentry
and
yet
enable
a
pilot
control
horizontal
land
on
a
runway
which
brought
him
back
to
square
one
a
wing
airplane
one
morning
in
burt
have
his
eureka
moment
the
wing
themselves
could
act
as
the
feather
spaceshipone
be
effectively
two
plane
in
one
during
the
boost
phase
and
ascent
the
wing
would
be
configure
normally
but
for
the
supersonic
phase
of
the
descent
their
rear
half
would
fold
upward
along
a
hinge
at
a
degree
angle
create
the
high
drag
need
for
a
carefree
reentry
back
in
the
atmosphere
the
plane
would
revert
to
its
original
configuration
and
become
a
pilot
control
glider
along
the
line
of
the
x
from
a
safety
perspective
this
be
the
best
of
both

of

that
pass
his
test
we
reach
an
agreement
under
its
term
burt
would
develop
the
design
and
build
the
two
plane
in
return
for
a
minority
equity
stake
he
d
later
call
me
the
perfect
customer
because
i
defer
to
him
on
all
mission
critical
decision
that
s
a
core
element
of
my
management
philosophy
find
the
best
people
and
give
them
room
to
operate
as
long
as
they
can
accept
my
periodic
high
intensity
kibitz
at
the
start
my
goal
be
to
get
the
first
privately
support
astronaut
to
space
and
back
thereby
kick
off
a
new
era
of
commercial
spaceflight
though
the
x
prize
for
this
feat
have
be
announce
four
year
earlier
its
financing
seem
shaky
and
we
weren
t
counting
on
it
but
in
not
long
after
burt
and
i
sign
our

meet
its
criterion
burt

his
design
from
a
solo
pilot

to
a

plus
two

the
cost

more
than
double
from

i
knew
it
be
unlikely
to
stop
there
base
on
what
i
d
heard
about
bleeding
edge
aircraft
i
expect
spaceshipone
to
come
in
overweight
underpowered
over
budget
and
behind
schedule
the
remarkable
thing
about
mav
be
that
it
built
a
man
space
program
from
scratch
with
a
staff
that
average
around
thirty
people
and
they
didn
t
just
engineer
a

they
also
built

all
of
its

the

the

who
have
previously
flown
at

brian

have
manage
the

s
rocket
development
program
brian
be
also
more
familiar
with
the
rocket
s
motor
he
be
the
obvious
choice
i
flew
to
mojave
early
that
morning
to
join
the
five
a
m
preflight
meeting
in

out
on

secure
beneath

i
follow
burt
and
doug
to
the

where
team
member
don
headset
and
sat
before
their
networked

computer
i
get
a
kick
out
of
see
how
modern
pc
be
be
put
to

they
scan

ran
them
through

go
this
flight
be
new
territory
for
burt
with
his
first

design
to
go
faster
than
mach
the
thrust
of
a
rocket
motor
be
basically
a
control
explosion
if
a
leak
lead
to
some
structural
failure
it
be
a
good
bet
that
we
d
lose
our
pilot
the
other
nightmare
scenario
be
that
the
motor
might
not
light
at
all
which
happen
several
time
in
early
ground
test
a
puff
of
smoke
then
nothing
with
eight
hundred
pound
of
rubber
mold
into
the
rocket
case
a
lot
of
it
need
to
burn
away
before
the
pilot
could
land
spaceshipone
in
anything
close
to
its
normal
center
of
gravity
envelope
if
too
much
rubber
remain
he
d
come
in
so
hard
and
fast
that
he
might
have
to
divert
to
a
longer
runway
at
the
air
force
base
and
even
then
there
be
no
tell
whether
the
spaceship
s
small
tire
could
handle
the
weight
as
white
knight
climbed
into
the
sky
with
the
spaceship
strap
beneath
it
i
have
plenty
of
time
to
wonder
be
it
really
go
to
work
nearly
an
hour
after
departure
more
than
eight
mile
high
spaceshipone
be
release
a
moment
or
two
later
brian
lit
the
motor
it
felt
he
d
say
later
like
a
tsunami
come
through
the
cabin
unlike
a
jet
a
rocket
accelerates
to
full
power
instantaneously
like
a
slam
in
the
back
back
at
mission
control
i
peer
at
the
video
monitor
to
me
nothing
can
compete
with
a
rocket
boost
for
pure
exhilaration
the
bright
orange
glow
the
vertical
contrail
of
ice
crystal
like
an
arrow
reach
for
space
i
be
awed
and
grateful
to
be
a
part
of
it
then
come
something
unforeseen
a
wave
of
dread
i
d
be
deeply
affected
when
the
apollo
crew
lose
their
life
in
a
preflight
fire
i
d
felt
sick
watch
challenger
disintegrate
a
minute
into
its
flight
i
knew
intellectually
that
someone
might
die
in
spaceshipone
but
that
be
burt
s
familiar
territory
not
mine
in
the
software
business
after
all
your
bad
outcome
be
an
error
message
now
i
knew
the
person
whose
life
hung
in
the
balance
and
i
found
that
hard
to
handle
a
fifteen
second
burn
get
brian
twelve
mile
high
at
a
maximum
speed
of
mach
and
we
have
make
our
first
bit
of
history
all
system
be
in
order
so
i
go
outside
to
watch
the
land
with
dave
moore
my
liaison
to
mav
where
he
serve
as
manage
director
along
with
his
deputy
jeff
johnson
he
be
instrumental
in
keep
the
project
on
track
dave
briefed
me
as
i
follow
brian
s
final
descent
then
he
stop
because
my
face
have
go
white
navy
pilot
be
notorious
for
hard
landing
a
product
of
their
aircraft
carrier
training
their
heavy
hand
style
be
a
run
joke
among
test
pilot
but
today
it
wasn
t
funny
brian
hit
the
runway
so
hard
that
one
of
his
land
strut
snap
and
his
plane
careen
off
the
pavement
in
a
cloud
of
red
desert
dust
as
we
race
to
the
site
my
heart
be
in
my
throat
be
brian
hurt
when
they
open
the
cockpit
i
be
thankful
to
see
that
he
be
safe
visibly
curse
himself
out
my
attention
turn
to
spaceshipone
how
badly
be
it
damage
and
how
much
time
would
we
lose
our
plan
have
be
to
complete
the
x
prize
flight
by
the
follow
summer
any
delay
could
push
us
up
uncomfortably
against
our
deadline
burt
be
console
brian
stress
the
positive
he
d
flown
a
good
boost
go
supersonic
feather
and
defeathered
have
a
nice
glide
as
for
the
plane
burt
say
all
we
ve
get
there
be
real
minor
stuff
he
come
over
to
me
i
think
we
can
get
it
back
once
the
craft
be
towed
back
to
the
hangar
we
have
a
clearer
picture
the
ship
s
hull
be
scrap
but
not
damage
the
nitrous
oxide
tank
be
intact
the
land
gear
be
fine
just
ripped
out
of
the
ship
the
accident
would
set
us
back
about
two
month
there
be
still
time
to
get
in
the
three
remain
power
flight
on
our
test
schedule
the
postmortem
point
to
a
newly
instal
vibration
damper
with
an
unfortunate
side
effect
it
have
make
the
flight
control
less
responsive
when
they
get
cold
soak
in
the
frigid
temperature
of
high
altitude
as
brian
approach
the
runway
he
found
himself
wrestling
with
his
stick
fear
a
stall
he
drop
his
nose
and
come
in
too
fast
for
future
flight
the
damper
would
be
wrap
in
electric
blanket
and
cut
to
one
third
power
though
it
wasn
t
all
his
fault
i
could
tell
that
brian
s
mishap
have
shaken
the
team
s
confidence
in
him
and
he
drop
a
notch
on
the
depth
chart
he
d
have
to
redeem
himself
to
get
back
in
the
mix
for
another
shot
burt
have
follow
a
cardinal
rule
since
found
his
business
in
the
mid
s
no
press
or
public
at
any
test
flight
when
the
envelope
be
expand
on
june
six
month
after
brian
s
misadventure
he
broke
his
own
protocol
for
spaceshipone
s
trial
to
become
the
first
privately
fund
craft
to
pierce
the
boundary
of

for
burt
this
be
more
than
a
dress
rehearsal
for
the
x
prize
it
be
a
chance
to
make
history
and
he
want
the

to
be
part
of
it
spectator
begin
arrive
saturday
morning
two
day
before
the

by
early
monday
while
it
be

dark
ten
of

the

have
work
as
a
team
in
the
simulator
take
turn
and
critique
one
another
as
it
come
time
to
decide
who
would
fly
doug
shane
argue
that
pete
siebold
would
find
the
optimal
trajectory
and
give
us
the
best
chance
to
reach
kilometer
yeah
burt
reply
but
pete
might
quit
he
be
refer
to
an
earlier
flight
the
first
with
a
full
load
of
nitrous
oxide
when
pete
have
consider
abort
after
an
early
stall
they
finally
settle
on
mike
a
gutsy
call
despite
mike
s
hour
of
flight
time
this
would
be
well
beyond
anything
he
have
do
when
i
watch
the
pilot
in
the
minute
before
takeoff
it
felt
as
though
they
be
on
their
way
to

brian

it
hit
me
that
no
one
knew
for
sure
if
mike
would
return
as
i
shook
his
hand
and
wish
him
a
safe
flight
sally
be
plainly
terrify
a

herself
she
knew
the
hazard
too
well
mike
squeeze
into
his
five

would

our

couldn

fully
simulate

he

wouldn

shut
down

unless
his

seem
in

even

he
begin
his

enter
three

he
open
the

watch
the

about

mike
defeathered
into
the
glide
phase
i
couldn
t
help
but
notice
that
he
be
nearly
thirty
mile
off

when
i
ask
if
he
d
have
to
land
at

assure
me
that
the

i
saw
him

the
chase

buzz
over
our

sally

then
flung
his

out

for

there

moment
in

that
deserve
a

that

towed
up

down

atop

he
wave

i
brought
him

complete
their

she
told
him
we

mike
told
sally
that
he
didn
t
think
he
d
make
it
burt
be
more
confident
but
still
have
concern
accord
to
the
low

of

we
d
clear
it
by

when

met
year

found
him
very
sharp

very
restless
one
of
those

who
can

he

he

three
month
after
mike

we
sign
a

could
net

for

which
be

three
day
later
burt
s
early
assessment
of
our
competition
be
on
target
on
a
single
day
in
august
unmanned
test
vehicle
from
both
space
transport
and
armadillo
aerospace
crashed
beyond

rumor
have
it
that
the
da
vinci
project
would
launch
their
balloon
in
a
prize
eligible
flight
on
october
but
i
didn
t
believe
it
they
hadn
t
do
a
single
test
flight
and
there
be
no
historical
example
of
go
from
zero
to
a
launch
of
that
magnitude
in
one
shot
no
one
else
have
give
the
require
sixty
day
notice
for
a
prize
qualify
flight
it
be
up
to
us
our
big
concern
be
that
spaceshipone
would
be
carry
an
additional
four
hundred
pound
in
line
with
the
x
prize
rule
that
stipulate
a
three
person
vehicle
fiberglass
box
fill
with
wrench
and
other
ballast
would
be
strap
into
the
plane
s
two
rear
seat
we
wouldn
t
put
three
people
in
the
plane
i
be
told
because
if
something
go
wrong
you
d
rather
have
one
fatality
than
three
the
extra
weight
be
a
legitimate
worry
would
our
rocket
motor
have
enough
juice
to
make
it
back
into
space
in
fact
spaceshipone
hadn
t
be
push
as
close
to
its
limit
in
june
as
it
have
seem
mike
s
shutdown
time
have
be
preset
as
a
precaution
he
could
have
run
the
motor
at
least
another
five
second
burt
chose
to
limit
the
burn
because
too
much
altitude
would
make
reentry
more
hazardous
with
a
cleaner
run
the
plane
might
have
make
it
into
space
with
ten
thousand
foot
to
spare
even
so
we
knew
we
couldn
t
afford
a
flaw
trajectory
on
the
x
prize
flight
to
minimize
the
risk
burt
exploit
the

design
nasa
s
unmanned
rocket
be
built
to
withstand

translates
to

in

the

built
with
a
margin
of

the
cabin
burt
want
high

we

right
here
right
now
what
be
happen
here
in

today
be
not
about

it
be
about

i

normally
they
sat
relaxed
in

check

a
minute
into
the

all
lean

do
for
a

then
i

calmly
polling

he
d
see

make
a

we
should
be

this

out
he

the

i
didn

brian

before
the

the

this
remote

despite
my
confidence
in

i
couldn
t
quite
block
out
a
little
voice
inside
my

with
each

something
unexpected
have
occur
the

what

go
to
happen
this

different

different
day
different

will
it
all

there
be

brian
ignite
the

this

matt
picked
it
up
loud
and
clear
and
he
shout
holy
crap
that
be
close
but
he
wasn
t
really
worried
give
spaceshipone
s
high

the

i
be
happy
for
him
the

nearly

more
than

on
the

down
brian

another

for
a

craft
after
he
retract
the

and
begin
his
glide
i
drove
out
with
burt
to
watch
the
land
it
s
hard
to
see
a
ship
as
small
as
spaceshipone
from
a
distance
especially
without
a
contrail
to
guide
the
eye
most
of
the
crowd
wouldn
t
spot
the
plane
until
it
be
almost
overhead
but
burt
picked
it
up
early
and
he
brought
richard
branson
and
me
close
to
see
where
he
be
point
there
s
a
great
candid
photograph
of
us
stand
side
by
side
with
our
left
arm
raise
high
and
index
finger
extend
shade
our

as
we
look
to
the
east
to
see
that
little
white
speck
come
home
twenty
four
minute
after
the
drop
from
white
knight
brian
s

touch
down
a
spotless
land
we
finally
have
our
perfect
flight
start
to
end
after
pop
champagne
on
the
tarmac
burt
and
richard
and
i
sat
on
the

of
a
pickup
truck
that
slowly
towed
the
stubby
homebuilt
spaceship
back
to
burt
s
hangar
or
what
i
call
the
world
s
great
garage
there
be
something
wonderfully
unpretentious
and
non
nasa
about
that
scene
spaceshipone
be
a
small
plane
built
by
a
modest
operation
but
it
have
be
to
space
and
back
with
a
person
inside
and
no
one
have
be
hurt
i
felt
a
huge
burden
lift
as
we
make
our
way
down
the
taxiway
to
the
roar
of
the
crowd
it
struck
me
that
spaceshipone
be
more
than
some
momentary
spectacle
it
offer
hope
to
everyone
who
aspire
to
journey
beyond
the
earth
there
be
a
reception
in
the

a
call
from
president
bush
who
congratulate
burt

me
for
opening
up
the

frontier
i
stammer

have
come
in

for
me
though
nothing
could
top
the
x

when
the
pressure
and
scrutiny
be
most
intense
our
team
have
come
through
one
month
later
i
flew
everyone
out
to
the

award
ceremony
in

burt

and
the
collier

an
even
great
honor
be
in
store
before
branson
come
on

burt
s
original
plan
be
to

strengthen
the

in

after

seem
to
have
contract
i
m
well
aware
of
other
urgent
social
priority
from
health
care
to
global
warm
but
i
also
believe
that
the
drive
toward
new
frontier
be
integral
to
our
humanity
a
mar
program
would
demand
billion
of
dollar
decade
of
development
and
a
willingness
to
accept
failure
and
tragedy
if
our
government
step
back
from
the
challenge
of
planetary
exploration
private
initiative
will
face
a
hard
road

the
rush
and
trepidation
that
i

know
at
mojave
there
be
a
time
when
i
thought
i
d
be
in
charles

place

see
up
close
what

involve
in

give
me
pause
i
m
not
an
edge
walker
i
ve
never
do
a
parachute
jump
for
example
because
it
just
doesn
t
seem
worth
the
downside
yet
when
i
peer
into
the
sky
that
october
day
to
track
our
spaceship
s
homeward
glide
i
recapture
my
boyhood
sense
of
wonder
when
i
d
look
up
at
the
starry
night
i
never
really
lose
that
feel
but
in
the
whirl
of
life
i
d
almost
forgotten
it
it
be
good
to
get
it
back
while
i
may
never
be
an
astronaut
a
part
of
me
be
up
there

my
tone
be
awful
for
some
time
as
i
saw
away
our
dog
jett
would
start
howl
it
s
good
that
you

my
mother

have
to
keep
at
it
i
didn
t
quite
want
to
quit
but
i
understood
the
deal
my
parent
would
pay
for
the
lesson
as
long
as
i
apply
myself
at
age
nine
i
write
dear
father
i
wish
to
continue
the

hardly
wait
to
play
a
mozart
etc

will
try
my
best
to
practice
every
day
your
son
paul
allen
in
fact
my
parent
be
disincline
to
let
me
stop
until
i
get
beyond
grade
school
and
be
old
enough
to
decide
if
i
want
to
continue
my
swan
song
be
a
chamber
music
performance
at
our
sixth
grade
graduation
which
i
might
have
enjoy
if
i
hadn
t
be
so
nervous
that
i
lose
my
place
in
the
score
in
walk
home
from
ravenna
school
and
fiddle
with
my
transistor
radio
i
come
across
the
beatles
i
want
to
hold
your
hand
my
early
memory
of
popular
music
i
watch
the
supremes
and
other
motown
group
on
the
ed
sullivan
show
and
thought
they
be
fabulous
when
i
first
heard
live
rock
at
a
seventh
grade
dance
loud
enough
to
reverberate
under
my
skin
it
make
a
last
impression
every
august
my
parent
take
a
vacation
and
left
jody
and
me
with
the
catania
family
up
the
block
in
when
i
be
go
into
eighth
grade
terry
catania
one
year
old
knew
the
top
cold
i
d
listen
to
some
of
her
prize
s
like
neil
diamond
s
cherry
cherry
and
now
she
have
something
new
you
know
the
monkees
she
ask
i
shook
my
head
i
hadn
t
heard
about
the
prefab
band
whose
hit
single
have
take
the
chart
by
storm
listen
to
this
terry
say
and
soon
i
be
bopping
to
the
beat
of
last
train
to
clarksville
i
bought
the
monkees
album
and
played
the
heck
out
of
it
then
i
start
watch
their
sitcom
i
d
be
too
young
for
beatlemania
when
the
fab
four
invade
north
america
two
year
earlier
i
be
with
my
family
in
vancouver
canada
just
after
the
beatles
played
there
and
be
amaze
to
hear
that
someone
have
bought
the
hotel
sheet
they
d
slept
on
but
my
timing
be
right
for
the
monkees
the
follow
august
terry
be
wild
about
a
new
album
that
have
broken
out
in
britain
that
spring
but
be
still
little
know
in
the
united
state
paul
you
ve
get
to
hear
this
she
exclaim
i
star
at
the
cover
as
she
slid
out
the
vinyl
a
swerve
of
psychedelic
purple
letter
ran
together
against
a
yellow
background
areyouexperienced
be
i
experienced
i
wasn
t
sure
what
that
meant
but
i
guess
the
answer
be
no
even
the
group
s
name
be
strange
the
jimi
hendrix
experience
a
fish
eye
photo
show
a
black
musician
in
an
orange
scarf
flank
by
two
white
sidemen
in
itself
unusual
the
back
cover
be
equally
arrest
a
black
and
white
backlit
photo
of
the
group
that
show
off
their
big
glow
afro
i
knew
then
and
there
that
you
could
not
get
cooler
than
jimi
once
terry
drop
the
needle
on
the
first
cut
purple
haze
i
wouldn
t
have
care
if
that
record
have
come
in
a
plain
brown
wrapper
i
be
floor
by
the
introduction
a
back
and
forth
devil
s
interval
between
hendrix
and
his
bass
player
noel
redding
weird
and
dissonant
this
be
jimi
with
a
sledgehammer
here
s
what
i
m
about
check
it
out
then
he
set
up
his
vocal
with
a
swoop
guitar
riff
jimi
s
play
be
funky
and
aggressive
but
smoothly
inflect
no
one
else
sound
anything
like
him
as
carlos
santana
once
say
most
people
play
fast
and
shallow
but
coltrane
played
fast
and
deep
and
so
do
charlie
parker
and
so
do
jimi
the
sound
itself
blew
me
away
purple
haze
be
heavy
with
deliberate
distortion
and
feedback
a
swirl
stereo
soundscape
yet
the
guitar
run
be
like
lace
clear
and
distinct
even
with
so
much
go
on
and
what
to
make
of
those
lyric
thrown
out
there
in
that
husky
voice
purple
haze
all
in
my
brain
lately
thing
just
don
t
seem
the
same
actin
funny
but
i
don
t
know
why
scuse
me
while
i
kiss
the
sky
whoa
what
be
he
talk
about
what
kind
of
poetry
be
that
the
sing
be
even
stranger
because
the
deep
reverb
on
jimi
s
voice
make
him
sound
as
though
he
be
in
the
next
room
there
be
african
inspire
grunt
and
click
la
miriam
makeba
and
a
stop
and
start
phrasing
that
kept
you
off
balance
at
the
end
he
use
his
customize
octavia
pedal
to
boost
his
note
by
an
octave
and
fly
off
into
the
stratosphere
with
a
shimmer
guitar
solo
i
didn
t
have
the
background
to
dissect
purple
haze
back
then
but
i
knew
it
felt
fresh
and
wonderful
while
eric
clapton
and
mick
jagger
be
also
bending
old
blue
form
hendrix
take
those
same
root
element
along
with
r
b
and
jazz
a
little
flamenco
and
george
frideric
handel
to
go
faster
deeper
right
out
of
the
solar
system
be
you
experienced
spoke
to
me
in
a
new
language
and
with
electric
ladyland
his
masterpiece
release
a
year
later
he
would
go
far
still
i
get
off
the
last
train
to
clarksville
once
i
heard
hendrix
i
be
hooked
he
wasn
t
for
everyone
which
make
him
even
more
special
i
remember
another
neighbor
paulette
cotton
a
protohippie
at
the
time
who
wore
funky
clothes
and
burn
incense
and
like
hendrix
almost
as
much
as
i
do
i
felt
avant
garde
even
if
i
still
look
like
a
conventional
middle
class
kid
from
seattle
i
wasn
t
ready
to
emulate
the
flower
child
and
hippy
in
the
university
district
though
i
do
have
a
buddy
at
lakeside
who
wore
a
paisley
scarf
i
bought
be
you
experienced
and
played
it
nonstop
on
our
living
room
stereo
my
mother
be
dismayed
how
can
you
stand
that
paul
it
s
just
noise
and
like
generation
of
teenager
before
me
i
d
respond
but
mom
listen
to
it
give
it
a
chance
but
when
i
try
to
explain
why
i
love
it
she
shook
her
head
and
left
the
room
my
taste
be
change
i
bought
record
by
bluesmen
like
buddy
guy
and
b
b
king
and
i
switch
to
a
progressive
fm
station
that
played
hendrix
and
the
velvet
underground
and
cream
lakeside
have
a
stereo
reel
to
reel
setup
in
the
basement
of
what
use
to
be
the
school
chapel
whenever
i
have
the
chance
i
d
use
it
to
record
hendrix
song
off
the
radio
like
a
roll
stone
from
the
monterey
pop
festival
or
the
feedback
laden
national
anthem
that
have
astonish
people
at
woodstock
i
be
play
the
latter
back
one
day
when
the
music
department
chairman
rush
in
and
say
turn
that
off
stop
it
those
be
the
most
awful
sound
i
have
ever
heard
from
an
instrument
i
be
embarrass
but
defiant
i
knew
he
be
wrong
how
could
anyone
who
love
music
not
get
it
how
could
they
miss
what
i
be
hearing
my
dream
instrument
be
a
fender
stratocaster
like
jimi
s
i
d
walk
past
the
first
avenue
pawnshop
that
hendrix
himself
once
haunt
and
stare
at
the
row
of
guitar
so
close
yet
so
far
i
be
sure
they
d
help
me
play
five
time
well
but
even
a
use
strat
cost
several
hundred
dollar
way
beyond
my
allowance
when
i
be
sixteen
my
mother
give
me
my
first
electric
guitar
she
found
it
at
the
wise
penny
thrift
store
and
paid
five
dollar
know
full
well
what
she
d
be
in
for
the
guitar
be
a
bright
red
japanese
copy
of
a
hollow
body
gibson
with
crummy
tone
and
noisy
pickup
and
i
be
thrill
to
have
it
i
try
to
crib
from
doug
fullmer
who
take
guitar
lesson
but
mostly
i
taught
myself
though
i
could
read
a
bit
from
my
time
with
the
violin
there
be
no
sheet
music
for
what
i
want
to
learn
mostly
i
just
listen
to
the
same
record
over
and
over
strain
to
absorb
what
i
heard
as
i
played
along
look
back
i
wish
that
i
d
gotten
a
teacher
join
a
band
laid
a
firmer
foundation
in
fundamental
and
music
theory
there
be
something
to
be
say
for
the
methodical
but
jimi
be
addictive
and
i
forge
on
alone
with
him
make
slow
but
steady
progress
i
start
with
hey
joe
a
relatively
simple
song
then
i
move
on
to
purple
haze
which
hendrix
write
when
first
make
his
name
in
london
it
have
a
rawness
that
s
miss
from
his
later
studio
orient
composition
but
make
no
mistake
purple
haze
be
the
work
of
a
fully
form
artist
it
s
a
steep
challenge
for
any
disciple
and
it
become
my
white
whale
it
take
me
countless
hearing
to
fumble
around
and
find
the
chord
with
jimi
s
extra
note
hammer
on
hendrix
played
with
otherworldly
speed
when
he
soloed
and
i
be
usually
overmatched
i
d
be
absurdly
happy
when
i
capture
even
percent
of
a
riff
i
felt
like
i
be
slowly
crack
the
code
though
i
might
never
be
technically
polished
i
strove
to
find
my
own
style
and
put
emotion
into
each
note
as
jimi
do
even
in
song
like
machine
gun
full
of
firework
and
special
effect
hendrix
be
all
about
expression
when
i
jammed
on
hey
joe
after
school
with
friend
i
d
try
to
get
inside
the
chord
sequence
and
add
a
little
soulfulness
to
my
solo
i
love
the
freedom
of
improvisation
when
you
could
make
a
song
your
own
now
put
yourself
in
my
parent
place
your
teenage
son
be
struggle
to
play
along
with
some
really
loud
music
over
and
over
again
and
it
s
so
bad
that
your
dog
howl
along
with
my
mother
s
tolerance
near
its
limit
i
hooked
my
instrument
into
our
stereo
so
i
could
mute
the
sound
and
listen
to
both
record
and
guitar
through
my
headphone
but
whenever
i
be
home
alone
or
just
with
jody
i
d
crank
it
up
and
wail
away
that
lead
to
my
own
first
brush
with
feedback
which
i
thought
be
pretty
cool
though
i
couldn
t
even
begin
to
control
it
the
way
jimi
do
in
may
when
i
be
in
tenth
grade
a
lakeside
classmate
name
jeff
wedgwood
clue
me
in
to
a
jimi
hendrix
experience
show
at
seattle
center
coliseum
my
first
rock
concert
with
blind
date
in
tow
we
sneak
down
close
and
center
for
the
first
three
song
before
get
kick
back
to
our
real
seat
behind
the
stack
of
speaker
where
you
could
barely
see
jimi
unless
he
be
on
the
apron
of
the
stage
even
so
i
be
dazzle
hendrix
be
a
magnetic
virtuoso
in
total
control
i
d
come
with
high
expectation
and
he
blew
right
past
them
the
four
of
us
get
so
high
on
the
music
that
one
of
the
girl
invite
us
afterward
to
her
house
to
listen
to
be
you
experienced
jeff
and
i
buzz
for
day
by
the
summer
of
i
be
obsess
with
all
thing
hendrix
on
weekend
i
sport
button
fly
purple
bell
bottom
a
medallion
around
my
neck
and
a
mississippi
river
gambler
s
hat
sort
of
a
poor
man
s
hendrix
hat
in
my
bedroom
i
put
up
a
black
and
white
poster
of
jimi
play
with
his
eye
close
he
wore
a
dark
band
jacket
and
a
gold
medallion
on
his
bare
chest
and
his
arm
shot
off
in
one
direction
and
his
upside
down
guitar
a
leftie
he
use
a
right
hand
instrument
in
another
a
seattle
native
hendrix
return
that
july
to
play
at
sick
stadium
a
baseball
park
this
time
the
seat
be
open
and
my
date
and
i
get
there
early
enough
to
score
spot
twenty
foot
from
the
stage
the
weather
be
dry
when
jimi
come
out
but
then
it
begin
to
drizzle
and
soon
we
have
a
good
seattle
rain
they
have
prepared
a
plastic
awning
to
shield
him
but
hendrix
ignore
it
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
stage
with
his
eye
close
as
the
rain
soak
through
his
orange
velour
jumpsuit
and
water
stream
off
his
stratocaster
up
close
he
be
a
powerful
presence
and
so
mind
crushingly
loud
that
you
couldn
t
always
be
sure
what
the
song
be
hendrix
look
wipe
out
that
even
and
he
didn
t
play
as
well
as
he
have
at
the
coliseum
but
jimi
at
percent
be
still
something
special
especially
if
you
could
watch
his
hand
up
close
play
voodoo
child
and
red
house
and
a
few
of
his
newer
song
he
d
sail
into
gorgeously
fluid
run
with
lightning
move
along
the
neck
of
the
guitar
and
never
a
wrong
note
hendrix
be
on
the
slight
side
but
his
hand
be
huge
and
his
finger
freakishly
long
he
could
make
his
stratocaster
talk
like
human
speech
flutter
his
wrist
for
a
deep
vibrato
that
make
the
note
sing
there
be
stretch
where
he
d
play
the
bass
part
with
his
thumb
and
the
lead
chord
with
his
finger
or
the
rhythm
against
the
lead
it
sound
like
two
guitar
come
out
of
one
jimi
improvised
for
much
of
the
concert
his
solo
be
different
each
night
when
great
artist
play
live
they
take
what
s
inside
them
and
offer
it
to
the
audience
it
s
both
a
gift
and
an
invitation
i
m
go
way
out
there
come
with
me
but
after
i
do
some
crazy
stuff
i
ll
bring
it
all
the
way
home
sick
stadium
be
jimi
s
last
appearance
in
seattle
one
day
after
school
two
month
later
i
heard
the
shock
news
hendrix
have
choked
to
death
in
his
sleep
in
london
after
mix
alcohol
and
barbiturate
i
go
home
that
day
and
played
electric
ladyland
for
hour
my
parent
take
one
look
at
my
face
and
be
kind
enough
not
to
protest
my
sadness
take
a
while
to
fade
jimi
have
write
and
record
so
many
great
song
in
just
three
year
and
i
couldn
t
stop
think
about
all
the
music
he
d
never
get
a
chance
to
create
he
be
bury
in
renton
just
southeast
of
seattle
but
i
never
could
quite
bring
myself
to
visit
his
grave
one
of
my
first
major
acquisition
as
a
hendrix
collector
be
the
white
woodstock
stratocaster
whose
feedback
have
so
appalled
the
lakeside
music
director
i
bought
it
in
for
a
record
price
for
a
guitar
but
not
too
much
i
thought
for
a
touchstone
of
rock
and
guitar
history
as
i
finger
its
rust
string
or
its
headstock
it
struck
me
that
it
be
a
tool
of
jimi
s
trade
no
more
and
no
less
one
of
dozen
of
guitar
he
go
through
in
his
career
the
woodstock
strat
wasn
t
in
play
condition
but
i
do
plug
another
guitar
into
jimi
s
uni
vibe
the
pedal
that
create
his
watery
reverb
it
felt
like
i
be
touch
his
sound
just
a
little
at
a
sotheby
s
auction
i
bought
a
wide
brim
black
felt
hat
that
hendrix
have
worn
for
his
smash
hit
cover
photo
when
i
open
the
box
and
pull
off
the
tissue
paper
it
felt
strange
to
hold
that
hat
in
my
hand
there
be
something
of
jimi
in
it
the
power
of
that
moment
help
spark
the
idea
of
create
a
public
venue
to
honor
his
art
i
figure
that
other
people
would
get
a
kick
out
of
the
artifact
too
at
the
time
hendrix
be
officially
remember
in
seattle
by
a
brass
star
on
an
artificial
rock
at
woodland
park
zoo
nothing
more
though
after
our
project
be
under
way
the
city
instal
a
bronze
statue
in
capitol
hill
of
jimi
play
on
his
knee
i
thought
he
deserve
well
as
jody
and
i
originally
conceive
it
the
jimi
hendrix
museum
would
be
a
ten
thousand
square
foot
gallery
at
the
flag
pavilion
a
building
from
the
world
s
fair
i
met
al
hendrix
jimi
s
father
a
gardener
who
own
the
right
to
his
son
s
music
and
legacy
he
be
a
sweet
temper
man
and
seem
enthuse
about
our
idea
a
few
month
later
al
and
janie
hendrix
jimi
s
stepsister
come
to
my
office
look
janie
say
we
found
out
that
we
re
get
ripped
off
as
al
later
claimed
in
litigation
he
d
sign
paper
on
the
advice
of
his
then
lawyer
leo
branton
think
they
be
licensing
deal
but
gradually
he
say
he
come
to
believe
that
he
d
be
deceive
into
transfer
jimi
s
legacy
to
a
complex
web
of
company
all
link
to
his
attorney
al
say
he
be
get
a
year
for
intellectual
property
worth
ten
of
million
of
dollar
the
family
lack
the
resource
to
pursue
an
all
out
lawsuit
so
they
come
to
me
want
to
help
level
the
play
field
i
agree
to
cover
the
family
s
legal
expense
in
their
effort
to
recover
jimi
s
legacy
if
the
action
be
successful
they
d
repay
me
out
of
revenue
from
the
recover
catalog
if
it
fail
they
d
owe
me
nothing
in
april
al
hendrix
file
suit
charge
branton
with
fraud
meanwhile
we
go
ahead
with
our
plan
for
a
nonprofit
jimi
hendrix
museum
we
ask
the
family
for
the
right
to
use
jimi
s
name
likeness
and
image
and
to
display
some
family
memorabilia
make
clear
that
this
wasn
t
a
quid
pro
quo
for
our
support
a
memorandum
of
understand
be
drawn
by
mid
i
d
advanced
million
for
the
litigation
and
chose
to
stop
there
the
family
have
make
good
progress
and
it
look
as
though
they
could
finish
the
job
without
more
help
around
that
time
licensing
negotiation
stall
between
the
family
and
our
museum
i
be
surprised
but
i
understood
lose
control
of
jimi
s
legacy
have
be
traumatic
for
al
and
janie
they
be
be
extra
cautious
to
prevent
it
from
happen
again
in
may
a
month
before
the
case
be
to
go
to
trial
the
party
agree
to
a
settlement
that
conveyed
to
al
hendrix
all
right
claim
and
interest
in
and
to
any
and
all
part
of
the
property
described
generally
as
the
jimi
hendrix
legacy
though
the
defendant
admit
no
wrongdoing
it
be
a
big
victory
for
the
hendrix
clan
and
i
felt
good
that
justice
have
be
do
for
the
family
and
for
jimi
s
music
as
well
after
a
well
attend
public
hearing
back
in
we
realize
that
it
wasn
t
enough
to
just
lay
out
some
clothes
and
guitar
and
say
this
represent
creativity
as
jody
told
a
local
magazine
writer
we
have
to
have
substantial
program
to
connect
the
memorabilia
with
the
idea
we
be
try
to
get
across
in
short
our
museum
have
to
tell
a
story
it
need
to
place
jimi
in
the
context
of
his
musical
heritage
in
seattle
and
the
pacific
northwest
along
the
way
i
hop
that
we
might
investigate
one
of
the
great
question
where
do
creativity
come
from
this
more
ambitious
institution
deserve
a
new
name
i
come
up
with
experience
music
project
to
imply
a
place
that
would
always
be
dynamic
a
work
in
progress
experience
of
course
be
a
tip
of
the
hat

jimi
and
his
band
in
february
jody
announce
that

be
sit
on
a
parcel
lease
from
the
city
near

needle
the
museum
would
expand
to

and
end
up

sister
be
that

me
point
blank
what
kind
of
building
do
i
want
it
be
a
tough
question
i
knew
that
i
want
color
because
jimi
s
music
like
his
paint
guitar
and
wild
stage
outfit
be
anything
but
monochromatic
much
of
gehry
s
past
work
have
be
rough
edge
and
angular
but
i
prefer
something
more
flow
and
organic
like
the
guggenheim
bilbao
what
i
want
most
of
all
a
certain
freeness
of
spirit
wasn
t
easy
to
distill
into
word
gehry
ask
what
i
like
about
jimi
s
music
and
i
reflect
on
the
hundred
of
hour
i
d
spent
listen
to
it
i
thought
about
the
way
it
soar
into
the
stratosphere
and
then
swoop
down
again
and
i
say
i
want
something
swoopy
the
architect
steer
me
to
a
table
packed
with
model
of
his
work
and
ask
me
to
choose
the
swoopiest
i
picked
an
undulate
silver
shell
the
horse
s
head
conference
center
at
gehry
s
dg
bank
in
berlin
it
have
powerful
curve
even
in
miniature
and
a
nonlinear
form
that
remind
me
of
an
improvised
hendrix
riff
and
gehry
say
that
s
just
where
i
want
to
go
his
first
three
dimensional
model
for
emp
be
an
asymmetrical
group
of
round
shape
in
bright
metallic
color
with
broken
wire
connote
guitar
string
along
the
top
i
fear
that
i
might
have
offend
gehry
when
i
say
they
remind
me
of
linguine
two
tweak
later
with
the
broken
wire
morph
into
color
glass
strip
i
be
happy
with
not
a
single
straight
line
or
right
angle
emp
have
to
be
one
of
the
most
complicate
building
ever
design
it
have
a
free
form
quality
that
evoke
music
just
what
i
d
be
after
we
could
have
make
it
square
and
gray
and
monochromatic
but
wouldn
t
that
have
be
boring
emp
be
rock
n
roll
architecture
in
your
face
rebellious
large
than
life
it
s
exuberant
and
fearless
like
the
man
who
inspire
it
we
set
the
tone
for
emp
s
grand
opening
in
june
with
a
red
carpet
charity
fund
raiser
the
night
before

inside
emp

on

they
all
become
virtual
rock
star
complete
with
color
light
a
fog
machine
and
a
digital
crowd
scream
adoration
the
night
capped
eight
year
of
planning
and
construction
i
celebrate
by
jamming
with
herbie
hancock
robbie
robertson
and
dave

in
emp

sky
church
an
open
space
eighty
five
foot
high
with
a
square
foot
lead
screen
it
be
name
after
jimi
s
conception
of
a
gathering
spot
where
people
of
every
color
and
nationality
could
make
music
and
set
spirit
soar
as
we
riffed
together
herbie
use
chord
i
didn
t
know
exist
but
no
matter
my
own
spirit
flew
high
that
night
the
next
morning
at
the
ribbon
cut
ceremony
i
say
to
create
a
world
class
institution
one
which
express
the
dynamic
engage
rebellious
nature
of
something
as
powerful
and
ever
change
as
popular
music
be
no
small
undertaking
emp
be
a
unique
combination
of
breathtaking
architecture
exhibit
design
technology
and
not
least
a
love
for
the
music
itself
as
i
finish
i
be
hand
a
dale
chihuly
glass
replica
of
a
fender
stratocaster
in
homage
to
hendrix
i
held
it
above
my
head
and
shout
let
the
experience
begin
before
hop
into
the
air
and
smash
it
at
my
foot
it
work
almost
too
well
i
hadn
t
realize
that
chihuly
s
sugar
glass
would
shatter
into
a
zillion
piece
dale
make
several
other
guitar
cast
in
various
hue
and
i
stow
them
on
one
of
my
boat
whenever
i
walk
past
them
i
can
t
help
but
smile
music
museum
face
a
special
challenge
which
become
clearer
to
me
when
i
use
emp
for
double
take
from
monet
to
lichtenstein
an
exhibition
of
twenty
eight
painting
from
my
collection
fine
art
museum
celebrate
direct
experience
with
the
art
itself
but
you
don
t
need
to
go
to
emp
to
hear
purple
haze
and
so
we
didn
t
conceive
our
museum
as
a
one
way
gallery
of
worshipful
viewer
and
static
object
our
sound
lab
allows
visitor
to
make
their
own
music
and
even
record
their
own
cd
when
they
be
ready
a
real
guitar
be
harder
to
play
than
guitar
hero
but
they
may
also
find
that
it
s
more
accessible
than
they
suspect
for
young
visitor
sound
lab
can
lead
to
one
of
our
teen
artist
workshop
or
summer
camp
or
into
our
mentor
and
scholarship
program
for
those
aim
at
a
music
career
each
year
we
host
a
pop
music
conference
and
a
battle
of
the
band
for
regional
musician
twenty
one
and
under
i
know
how
important
these
opportunity
be
the
computer
room
at
lakeside
give
me
a
creative
outlet
and
change
my
life
if
we
can
do
something
similar
for
other
young
people
through
emp
we
ll
be
honor
jimi
hendrix
in
the
best
way
possible
with
life
change
experience
for
all
who
be
open
to
them

i
ve
rarely
go
a
week
without
pick
up
a
guitar
it
s
more
than
a
hobby
it
give
me
balance
and
keep
me
in
the
moment
which
can
be
a
challenge
with
all
the
project
i
m
pursue
at
any
one
time
i
become
more
serious
about
play
after
microsoft
move
to
bellevue
when
i
form
my
first
real
band
with
a

d
played

to
record
up
till
then
and
i
have
a
lot
to
learn
my
technique
improve
because
you
need
to
be
more
precise
when
play
with
others
we
get
some
gig
at
birthday
and
wedding
reception
at
twenty
five

technically
make
me
a
professional
musician
in

grown
men
with
terry
davison

and
lead
and
write
or
cowrite
most
of
our
original
song
i
m
still
move
by
the
power
of
live
music
and
i
seek
it
out
every
chance
i
get
i
ve
be
fortunate
to
play
with
many
musician
i
ve
admire
include
one
inspirational
session
at
an
emp

ceremony
with
inductee
billy
cox
jimi

a
welcome
brotherhood
they

little
bit
jam

special
time
for
me
there
be
nothing
like
really
listen
to
other
player
as
we
feel
our
way
forward
together
to
cover
a
standard
tune
or
to
create
something
out
of
thin
air
only
a
small
percentage
of
these
musical
idea
become
fully
realize
song
but
the
joy
be
in
the
process
for
someone
like
me
who
tilt
toward
the
analytical
jamming

my
creative
intuitive
more
emotional
side
dave
stewart
put
me
on
to
a
national
institute
of

on
how
jazz

shuts
down
the
brain

the
flow
of
new
idea
when
i
m
jamming
my
shoulder
drop
and
my
mind
slows
i

loose
and
relaxed
after

tighter
until
it
be
stretch
to
the
point
where

i
first
met
dave
more
than
fifteen
year
ago
at
a
dinner
in
new
york
not
long
after
he
and
annie
lennox
disband
the
eurythmics
and
we
hit
it
off
he
s
full
of
energy
and
genuinely
curious
about
all
sort
of
thing
include
the
late
trend
in
technology
when
he
s
not
on
stage
you
wouldn
t
know
he
s
a
rock
star
dave
visit
me
in
seattle
a
few
year
ago
and
have
his
hair
bleach
blond
then
he
come
with
me
while
i
get
a
haircut
at
a
place
on
university
avenue
where
he
begin
run
his
video
camera
for
dave
life
be
a
documentary
i
be
still
in
the
chair
when
two
beefy
bikers
enter
the
shop
to
get
their
beard
trim
they
have
tattoo
up
and
down
their
arm
and
across
their
neck
and
dave
ask
if
he
could
film
them
oh
no
i
thought
the
bikers
be
bound
to
take
offense
at
this
nosy
guy
with
long
yellow
hair
and
a
camera
and
then
all
bet
would
be
off
but
dave
have
such
a
sweet
way
about
him
that
the
bikers
happily
explain
the
origin
of
each
tattoo
i
get
this
one
in
iraq
i
use
to
call
dave
mr
permission
because
he
s
like
a
pied
piper
spur
you
to
follow
your
muse
he
encourage
me
to
write
the
lyric
for
grown
men
the
album
i
produce
in
it
be

at
mccartney
s
studio
outside
london

be
surreal
to
hear
the
ex
beatle
that
unmistakable
voice
i
d
know
since
grade
school
over
a
studio
monitor
a
few
foot
away
when
dave
call
a
break
paul
show
me
around
the
studio
which
could
have
provide
the
core
exhibit
for
a
very
good
music
museum
here
be
the
mellotron
that
the
beatles
use
for
their
haunt
string
sound

sky
with

there
be
mccartney
s
bass
guitar
from
shea
stadium
in
one
of
the
band
s
last
live
performance
when
paul
flip
it
over
i
saw
something
taped
to
its
back
a
yellow
set
list
paul
say
i
m
suppose
to
look
at
some
picture
for
a
beatles
anthology
would
you
like
to
come
we
cross
to
a
shed
line
with
photograph
of
the
beatles
from
every
period
of
their
career
as
paul
consider
which
one
he
like
best
he
become
pensive
then
he
say
everyone
want
to
talk
about
john
john
john
you
know
i
write
some
song
too
i
be
take
aback
but
i
have
to
say
something
you
ve
write
some
of
the
most
amaze
song
ever
which
be
true
but
it
felt
strange
try
to
cheer
up
a
beatle
who
be
still
try
to
compete
with
a
fall
bandmate
mccartney
cast
his
own
shadow
of
course
as
bono
once
told
me
every
day
i
wake
up
with
the
beatles
bono
s
longtime
ambition
be
to
lead
the
big
band
in
the
world
which
he
s
pretty
much
accomplish
with
u
but
he
s
still
strive
to
write
song
that
stand
up
to
the
great
beatles
tune
and
it
ain
t
easy
even
for
the
most
talented
musician
i
met
paul
again
with
dave
a
few
year
later
at
the
abbey
road
studio
in
london
where
the
beatles
have
so
many
historic
record
session
they
be
work
on
another
song
this
one
in
connection
with
the
project
which
dave
name
after
nelson
mandela
s
prison
number
paul
s
band
smoothly
cranked
through
the
material
for
really
good
studio
musician
play
be
like
breathing
those
guy
polished
off
four
part
harmony
in
three
take
i
get
so
caught
up
in
the
process
that
i
overcame
my
reticence
and
say
to
dave
on
that
last
chorus
where
everything
build
it
would
be
great
to
have
some
piano
dave
say
let
me
ask
paul
a
minute
or
two
later
they
roll
out
a
little
upright
piano
that
they
d
use
on
many
beatles
song
paul
warm
up
with
some
honky
tonk
and
then
he
say
ok
let
s
roll
it
just
like
that
he
record
a
piano
overdub
on
the
out
chorus
and
that
s
the
way
whole
life
be
release
i
ve
listen
to
purple
haze
literally
thousand
of
time
i
still
find
new
thing
in
it
particularly
in
the
rhythm
and
the
guitar
interplay
one
phenomenal
aspect
of
hendrix
be
that
the
great
lead
guitarist
of
all
time
as
ranked
by
roll
stone
be
also
peerless
on
rhythm
guitar
it
wasn
t
until
the
late
s
that
i
found
the
song
s
chart
in
a
french
magazine
with
jimi
s
solo
transcribed
note
for
note
exactly
what
i
need
to
master
the
unconventional
finger
pattern
twenty
year
after
i
d
start
play
along
with
a
cassette
i
finally
get
through
purple
haze
at
tempo
though
it
have
be
all
i
could
do
to
keep
up
i
be
euphoric
through
dan
aykroyd
my
band
have
be
invite
to
open
house
of
blue
franchise
in
la
vega
dallas
and
new
jersey
as
with
many
musician
my
self
consciousness
recedes
in
performance
when
it
all
click
and
i
can
feel
the
audience
with
me
on
my
solo
i
play
that
much
well
our
band
do
well
enough
in
dallas
to
take
an
encore
and
i
damn
the
torpedo
and
go
with
purple
haze
over
the
next
three
minute
all
those
year
of
listen
and
absorb
and
practice
come
together
i
m
still
not
the
most
technically
accomplish
guitarist
but
i
always
try
to
go
for
a
few
killer
moment
as
jimi
call
them
where
i
dig
in
and
reach
for
a
note
that
have
some
real
soul
and
power
to
it
with
hendrix
just
play
the
note
isn
t
nearly
enough
you
have
to
feel
them
too
that
night
i
hit
everything
i
go
for
the
solo
built
and
built
and
then
i
caught
my
breath
and
take
it
in
a
different
direction
and
it
built
again
to
a
great
finish
the
audience
be
on
their
foot
and
cheer
even
sing
along
with
the
third
chorus
it
be
probably
my
best
live
performance
a
more
than
decent
version
of
an
incredibly
challenge
song
i
knew
i
d
never
play
it
the
way
jimi
do
but
i
be
satisfied
chapter

it
all
begin
for
me
in
the
late
s
with
a
small
company

south
of
seattle
skypix
the

the

less

the

colloquially
as

for
big
ugly

that
i
d
be

on
mercer

and
i
be
impressed
by
satellite

potential
with
a
signal
that
could
be

nationally
from

skypix
collapse
into
bankruptcy
without
sell
a
single
dish
it
be
a
bloodbath
but
it
open
my
eye
to
the
potential
of
new
digital
delivery
technology
if
my
experience
with
computer
have
taught
me
anything
it
be
never
to
underestimate
how
quickly
a
new
platform
could
bring
a
wave
of
change
how
would
a
fire
hose
of
digital
bit
blast
into
the
home
affect
our
consumption
of
video
or
data
or
music
what
be
the
opportunity
by
november
month
before
the
first
graphical
web
browser
i
be
tell
businessweek
that
we
be
on
the
cusp
of
a
wire
world
with
vast
ramification
at
some
point
i
say
everybody
in
the
industrialize
world
will
have
access
to
computer
and
they
ll
all
be
wire
together
my
vision
date
back
to
the
early
day
of
microsoft
when
i
d
talk
bill
s
ear
off
about
a
connect
future
in
which
service
and
information
would
be
accessible
anytime
anywhere
in
my
interview
with
microcomputer
interface
i
predict
that
the
personal
computer
would
far
outstrip
the
social
impact
of
the
pocket
calculator
the
computer
and
i
m
talk
about
the
home
information
retrieval
system
i
think
that
s
a
much
more
powerful
concept
than
a
machine
that
just
add
subtracts
multiplies
and
divide
definitely
if
you
take
the
computer
to
its
limit
perhaps
you
could
have
grocery
deliver
take
care
of
all
your
bill
and
if
you
re
a
programmer
you
could
do
your
work
at
home
never
leave
the
house
that
s
a
dramatic
change
as
of
the
early
s
social
application
be
just
begin
to
take
root
our
human
drive
for
connectivity
have
spur
the
recent
development
of
compuserve
and
america
online
and
it
wouldn
t
stop
there
like
the
personal
computer
the
wire
world
fit
my
criterion
for
a
big
idea
the
marriage
of
two
powerful
element
on
march
i
told
the
new
york
time
if
you
look
down
the
road
what
you
see
be
the
pervasiveness
of
high
bandwidth
data
communication
and
completely
inexpensive
compute
power
if
you
combine
those
two
thing
there
be
many
interest
thing
you
can
do
at
the
time
digital
fiber
optic
technology
and
new
compression
technique
held
the
promise
of
lightning
fast
two
way
multimedia
network
a
global
platform
for
new
family
of
product
and
application
high
speed
data
delivery
the
so
call
information
superhighway
would
redefine
how
we
talk
and
learn
and
experienced
entertainment
the
computer
would
evolve
from
a
tool
for
work
into
a
medium
for
content
of
all
sort
these
development
weren
t
speculative
in
my
view
a
high
bandwidth
network
would
be
built
and
people
would
use
it
i
be
sure
of
that
less
easy
to
foresee
be
who
would
do
the
connect
satellite
or
cable
telecom
or
wireless
or
something
yet
unimagined
but
regardless
of
how
the
delivery
system
played
out
i
be

in
earnest
that
summer
ten
month
later
i
own
percent
of
the
company
my
hope
be
for
america
online
to
move
from
a
low
bandwidth
dial
up
network
to
the
inevitable
high
speed
future
in
the
spring
of
i
travel
to
virginia
to
meet
with
ceo
and
chairman
steve
case
and
his
team
as
i
laid
out
my
idea
for
a
broadband
network
i
could
feel
the
chill
in
the
air
case
and
i
be
oil
and
water
he
be
wed
to
his
dial
up
wall
garden
even
if
it
meant
limit
content
to
what
an
analog
network
could
handle
and
found
my
idea
about
broadband
too
far
ahead
of
his
game
plan
it
probably
didn
t
help
that
i
be
still
microsoft
s
second
big
stockholder
and
a
member
of
its
board
though
microsoft
have
yet
to
do
much
of
anything
online
case
perceive
it
as
his
great
threat
actually
he
have
it
backward
i
want
to
use
my
stake
in
america
online
as
a
hedge
against
my
holding
in
microsoft
and
other
wire
world
investment
as
i
kept
snap
up
share
case
s
board
adopt
a
poison
pill
threshold
first
at
percent
which
i
d
already
pass
and
then
at
percent
once
trigger
the
provision
would
dilute
my
ownership
percentage
and
make
it
next
to
impossible
to
mount
a
hostile
takeover
that
be
never
my
intent
since
takeover
rarely
work
in
tech
company
but
i
take
the
hint
that
my
active
collaboration
wasn
t
welcome
i
held
on
to
my
piece
of
the
company
until
the
summer
of
when
bert
kolde
attend
an
open
house
at
bill
gate
s
home
on
lake
washington
microsoft
have
recently
target
the
network
service
business
with
an
initiative
call
blackbird
a
precursor
to
the
microsoft
network
bill
approach
bert
in
a
buffet
line
on
the
lawn
and
the
conversation
turn
to
my
interest
in
america
online
bill
say
why
would
paul
want
to
compete
with
us
i
m
just
go
to
tell
rus
siegelman
the
microsoft
network
leader
to
keep
lose
money
every
year
until
we
have
the
number
one
market
share
in
online
how
do
it
make
sense
to
compete
with
that
when
bert
relayed
bill
s
remark
to
me
they
have
the
intend
effect
a
year
earlier
i
d
attend
a
meeting
at
microsoft
where
bill
have
told
case
that
he
be
think
about
buying
all
or
part
of
america
online
or
la
khrushchev
that
he
might
decide
to
bury
the
small
company
now
it
sound
like
bill
have
settle
on
a
burial
i
could
see
steve
case
trap
in
a
two
front

besiege
on
one
flank
by
microsoft
and
on
the
other
by
the
emerge
world
wide
web
suddenly
my
stake
seem
less
attractive
especially
without
any
synergy
between
america
online
and
my
other
venture
i
dumped
my
stock
and
take
a
million

within
a

as

through
the

year
of
the
late
ninety
the
company
have
obvious
point
of
vulnerability
from
its
slow
adoption
of

to
the
grow
migration
of

to
the

but
the
tech
boom
masked
aol
s
weakness
and
sometimes
scale
alone
carry
the
day
at
least
until
something
a
lot
well
come
along
in
january
five
year
after
i
d
sell
my
stock
aol
announce
the
acquisition
of
time
warner
when
i
first
heard
the
rumor
i
thought
that
aol
s
market
cap
an
outlandish
billion
be
wildly
overvalue
just
three
year
later
the
new

time
would
call
the
merger
the
great
endure
monument
to
the
folly
of
the
internet
boom
still
one
hard
fact
remains
have
i
held
on
to
my
percent
of
america
online
i
would
have
be
sit
on
a
billion
bonanza
more
than
all
the
money
i
d
make
from
my
stake
in
microsoft
as
i
look
for
more
commercial
opportunity
in
the
wire
world
the
ticket
business
seem
like
a
natural
fit
it
have
a
mass
clientele
and
i
could
add
value
with
a
range
of
interactive
feature
search
function
preorders
seat
location
graphic
in
november
after
microsoft
back
off
from
a
last
minute
bid
i
paid
over
million
for
percent
of
ticketmaster
thrown
into
the
deal
be
the
service
of
the
company
s
tough
talk
president
and
ceo
fred
rosen
since
join
ticketmaster
in
fred
have
built
it
from
a
group
of
straggle
regional
ticket
service
into
a
billion
dollar
behemoth
that
dominate
the
industry
he
cut
deal
with
venue
and
paid
preemptive
fee
for
exclusive
right
nobody
dare
cross
him
i
thought
that
fred
and
i
should
get
to
know
each
other
so
i
flew
to
los
angeles
to
join
him
for
dinner
and
then
steely
dan
s
reunion
tour
at
the
hollywood
bowl
we
get
great
ticketmaster
seat
tenth
row
center
and
fred
slept
through
most
of
the
concert
he
wasn
t
much
of
a
music
fan
ticketmaster
have
built
its
dominance
via
two
mode
of
customer
service
say
you
want
to
go
to
a
u
concert
you
could
a
stand
in
line
at
one
of
fred
s
retail
outlet
at
a
record
store
or
b
call
a
ticketmaster
phone
bank
and
hope
you
wouldn
t
be
on
hold
for
too
long
my
solution
be
to
move
the
operation
online
we
could
create
a
web
site
and
link
our
service
to
site
in
the
sport
and
entertainment
field
from
the
super
bowl
to
the
roll
stone
next
u
s
tour
these
be
fresh
idea
amazon
com
be
two
year
away
and
e
commerce
still
in
its
infancy
a
few
people
make
airline

hotel
reservation
online
with
aol
or

but
the
web
have
yet
to
catch
on
as
a
way
of
sell
entertainment
it
definitely
hadn
t
caught
on
with
fred
rosen
though
his
business
have
be
computerize
for
year
he
fought
me
tooth
and
nail
over
take
it
online
every
so
often
i
d
ask
him
how
development
of
the
new
ticket
system
be
go
and
fred
would
metamorphose
into
a
high
decibel
old
school
promoter
i
m
not
sell
ticket
online
he
d
roar
because
the
bank
won
t
take
the
credit
card
and
the
customer
won
t
trust
the
security
you
have
to
go
with
me
on
this
paul
i
d
hold
the
phone
three
foot
from
my
ear
as
i
try
to
get
a
word
in
but
fred
you
don
t
understand
this
business
paul
i
ve
be

this
forever
and
people
aren

it
ain
t
gonna
work
paul
i
m
not
go
to
do
it
and
the
ticket
can
be
forge
or
steal
and
then
what
do
we
do
but
fred
my

the

finally
after

ok
we
re

it
s
come
along
two

later
fred
grudgingly

can
you

us
why

i
be
address
a
central
question
for
the

world
what
kind
of
content
would
people
want
most
from
a
broadband
network
to
find
an
answer
i
found
a
start
up
call
starwave
as
a
new
medium
software
publishing
company
and
hire
an
ambitious

as
a
test
market
of

we
be
both
obsessive

our

probably
our

to

it
on

mike

i
want
more

we

whose
sport

be
hard
to
beat

with
a

of

quickly
go

i
shut
it
down

others
who

i
conclude
that
xerox

be
probably
unique
to
its
time
and
place
it
would
not
be

i

disincline

goal

choice

have
a
chance
to
flourish
in
the
early
ninety
the

me
fly
to
los
angeles
twice
a
month
and
into
the
hollywood
orbit
my
high
profile
brought
an
invitation
to
the
sun
valley
summer
retreat
host
by
herb
allen
the
financier
with
deep
tie
to
the
entertainment
industry
i
met
david
geffen
there
and
found
that
we
have
common
passion
notably
art
and
music
geffen
be
smart
charm
and
full
of
advice
on
how
to
run
your
business
and
your
life
he
be
a
great
persuader
one
day
he
call
me
with
the
news
that
he
be
start
a
new
film
studio
call
dreamworks
skg
with
steven
spielberg
and
jeffrey
katzenberg
it
be
a
masterful
soft
sell
i
don
t
know
if
you
re
interested
he
told
me
but
you
can
have
your
financial
guy
contact
my
guy
we
d
love
to
have
you
be
part
of
our
team
i
didn
t
need
much
coax
i
be
flatter
that
he
d
ask
and
intrigue
by
the
venture
i
d
be
a
passionate
movie
buff
since
grow
up
with
genre
triple
feature
at
seattle
s
colonial
theater
sometime
later
when
seattle
s
classic
movie
palace
the
cinerama
be
about
to
be
torn
down
i
step
in
to
buy
it
and
restore
it
to
its
former
glory
i
d
already
be
scout
movie
studio
as
possible
investment
before
geffen
call
dreamworks
represent
something
special
the
first
new
major
hollywood
studio
in
decade
it
be
a
chance
to
get
involve
with
some
of
the
most
creative
mind
in
the
business
spielberg
the
genius
auteur
katzenberg
the
razor
sharp
perfectionist
geffen
the
consummate
dealmaker
together
they
seem
ready
to
join
me
in
create
a
new
convergence
of
entertainment
and
digital
technology
maybe
we
d
use
content
from
the
studio
to
enrich
the
value
of
the
broadband
pipe
or
we
might
form
a
strategic
partnership
with
starwave
it
be
the
begin
of
the
dot
com
bubble
and
anything
seem
possible
in
march
i
put
up
million
the
single
big
investment
i
d
make
to
that
point
in
hindsight
it
wasn
t
such
a
great
deal
while
my
half
billion
dollar
bought
an
percent
stake
the
three
principal
put
up
a
total
of
million
for
two
third
i
paid
eighteen
time
more
per
point
of
equity
bad
i
be
take
the
lion
s
share
of
the
risk
without
equivalent
voting
right
the
principal
pitch
be
that
they
d
be
put
in
valuable
sweat
equity
but
as
tom
king
write
in
the
operator
the
deal
be
structure
accord
to
geffen
s
mo
in
his
previous
business
geffen
have
proven
to
be
a
risk
averse
executive
masterful
at
limit
overhead
but
with
such
capital
intensive
plan
as
building
an
animation
company
from
the
ground
up
geffen
realize
that
stagger
overhead
would
be
unavoidable
for
dreamworks
thus
he
brilliantly
employ
another
tactic
that
have
work
so
well
for
him
in
the
past
use
other
people
s
money
i
didn
t
plan
to
be
a
passive
investor
in
dreamworks
while
i
wouldn
t
have
dream
of
intrude
on
the
moviemaking
i
be
give
to
believe
that
i
d
have
a
say
in
the
company
s
broad
direction
a
press
release
described
me
as
a
member
of
the

s
board
of
director
who
would
also
have
input
on
dreamworks
strategy
particularly
in
the
area
of
multimedia
and
interactive
development
the
three
principal
go
on
to
say
we
be
excite
about
our
partnership
with
paul
because
his
vision
and
technology
expertise
complement
our
interest
in
film
animation
music
and
television
paul
allen
be
one
of
the
first
people
in
the
world
to
realize
technology
would
bring
about
a
fundamental
positive
change
in
the
way
people
live
and
work
he
s
the
perfect
partner
for
a
company
that
be
commit
to
building
the
digital
studio
of
the
st
century
i
have
no
way
of
tell
whether
their
profess
enthusiasm
be
authentic
but
one
thing
be
certain
my
creative
opportunity
would
fall
short
of
my
expectation
the
studio
take
three
year
to
release
its
first
movie
and
the
television
and
record
department
lag
as
well
in
i
take
a
percent
stake
in
a
joint
venture
by
dreamworks
and
ron
howard
s
imagine
entertainment
it
be
call

short
film
production
company
for
the
internet
what
initially
seem
like
the
perfect
wire
world
application
the
problem
be
that
we
overestimate
both
the
adoption
curve
for
broadband
and
the
appetite
for
short
form
video

like
skypix
it

i
have
great
moment
with
dreamworks
when
american
beauty
won
the
academy
award
for
best

and
i
met
kevin
spacey
at
an

he
be
over
the
moon
clutch
his
oscar
as
though
he
d
never
let
it
go
then
there
be
the
time
spielberg
invite
me
onto
the
set
of
the
lose
world
the
jurassic
park
sequel
for
hour
i
observe
a
laborious
sequence
of
take
and
retake
and
camera
setup
for
someone
uninvolved
in
the
process
it
be
like
watch
beautiful
paint
dry
katzenberg
periodically
ushered
board
member
to
dog
and
pony
show
at
the
studio
but
he
seem
resistant
when
i
suggest
that
he
shift
completely
from
cel

if
all
go
well
our
leverage
would
boost
our
stock
price
but
if
something
go
wrong
that
be
my
blind
spot
and
my
first
big
mistake
with
charter
my
second
in
deal
to
buy
other
system
with
charter
stock
i
guaranteed
that
the
former
owner
could
sell
their
share
back
to
me
at
a
prenegotiated
price
if
cable
value
fell
and
the
stock
slump
that
price
would
be
grossly
inflate
the
seller
be
protect
their
downside
at
my
expense
my
third
error
be
underestimate
the
importance
of
critical
mass
of
customer
while
other
msos
have
be
building
out
system
in
major
city
for
year
charter
s
acquisition
be
mainly
weight
in
far
flung
rural
network
with
relative
handful
of
subscriber
though
we
have
substantial
segment
in
st
louis
and
in
fort
worth
texas
along
with
a
good
share
of
los
angeles
we
never
gain
control
of
a
top
market
our
strategy
to
become
the
dominant
operator
in
l
a
founder
when
we
be
outbid
for
adelphia
and
century
communication
what
s
more
our
large
acquisition
be
second
and
third
rate
asset
most
of
falcon
s
system
be
in
remote
area
of
southern
california
and
offer
only
thirty
five
channel
barely
a
third
of
the

s
norm
it
would
take
a
huge
capital
investment
for
charter
to
catch
up
and
a
lot
more
to
upgrade
the
company
s
infrastructure
even
after

so
our
return
would
pale

some

with
most

complete
the

conclude
the

there

the

that

equally

on
the

a

must
continually

it
also
seem
reasonable
that
i

some
consideration
for
my

the

which
would
save
the

we
left
behind
a
company
with
positive
cash

a
strong
foundation
but
the
lesson
i
learn
be
among
the
most
expensive
ever
my
net
loss
in
the
cable
business
be
billion
with
the
clarity
of
hindsight
i
could
say
that
i
take
the
wrong
people
s
advice
in
plunge
into
charter
i
need
savvier
more
experienced
executive
to
ass
my
risk

to
run
the
company
and
i
didn
t
have
them
until
it
be
too
late
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
investment
be
mine
and
i
make
serious
miscalculation
most
of
all
i
fail
to
understand
the
downside
of
over
leverage
my
dream
of
a
wire
world
empire
finally
sank
under
the
weight
of
charter
s
mountain
of

in
place
the
big
bet
of
my
life
on

i
focus
on
its
potential
to
change
the
world
not
the
downside
scenario
after
embrace
skypix
early
on
i
underestimated
the
challenge
from
satellite
system
with
their
reputation
for
superior
service
i
do
the
same
with
the
phone
company
video
and
data
offering
and
i
fail
to
discern
that
the
cable
pipe
couldn
t
galvanize
change
by
itself
or
at
least
not
as
quickly
as
i
d
thought
operator
have
reaped
handsome
profit
from
sell
high

but
they

add
value
with
new
product
and
service
over
the
top
of
the
data
stream
even
today
the
fat
pipe
remains
by
and
large
a
dumb
pipe
at
the
same
time
recent
trend
suggest
that
i
be
more
right
than
wrong

simply
want
to

so
that

i
recognize
this

early
as
in

interview
with

in

to
be

computer
must
understand
that
be
probably
the
critical
word
it
be
one
thing
to
feed
the
tale
of
two
city
into
a
computer
it
s
another
to
have
the
computer
understand
what
s
be
say
you
can
t
ask
it
a
question
about
the
theme
of
a
book
or
why
a
character
do
something
and
get
a
coherent
answer
we
haven
t
yet
reach
that
level
with
intelligent
computer
and
we
still
haven
t
today
but
we
re
get
closer
for
a
far
explanation
of

see
the

ultimately
a

should
make

it
just
might

you

the

kurzweil
predict
that
the

will
soon
lead
to
a

of

change
so
rapid
and
profound
it
represent
a
rupture
in
the

of

kurzweil
foresees
the
imminent
arrival
of

as

being
the
first

gain
a

though
i
won
t
say
that
a

be
impossible
i
believe
that
it
be

away
at
best
although
kurzweil
credit
moore

as
an
inspiration
gordon
moore
agrees
with
me
note
that
human
development
involves
a
lot
more
than
just
the
intellectual
capability
and
doubt
that
machine
could
overcome
that
overall
gap
the
sheer
complexity
of
human
brain
function
be
daunt
in
the
extreme
it
take
forty
year
to
develop
a

that
could
consistently
beat
the

human
player
even
though
grandmaster

chess
can
be
achieve
with
simple
sequential
logic
and
brute
force
processing
to
get
a
computer
to
read
and
understand
human
language
be
incomparably
harder
we
can
t
replicate
the
brain
because
we
ve
barely
begin
to
understand
how
it
work
there
be
two
basic
approach
to
artificial

both
of
them
journey
of
thousand
of
small
step
you
can
take
the

approach
in
which
we
re
invent
software
to
emulate
some
of
the
thing
the

can
do
or
you
can
try
to
reverse

the
physical

itself
to
see
how
it
really
function

be
the

be
a
never

the

that
unites
us
as

distinguishes
us
from

another
it
keep
us
breathing

upright
make
us
elate
or
anxious
and
not

harbor
our
creativity
here
be
a
truly
astonish
piece
of
evolutionary
engineering
one
that
do
so
many
thing
so
much
well
than
the
most
advanced
computer
and
yet
we
re
just
scratch
its

the
s
saw
an
explosion
of
new

in

the
conversion
of

into

in
february
eleven

after
it
begin
the

i
be
meeting
around
that
time
with
expert
in
early
learn
and
linguistics
and
their
research
be
engage
but
i
felt
a
pull
to
get
inside
the
human
brain
the
ultimate
machine
to
think
it
through
i
met
with
jim
watson
the
director
of
the
cold
spring
harbor
laboratory
and
codiscoverer
of
the

then
in
his
seventy
watson
be
a
confirm
iconoclast
always
ready
to
venture
off
the
beaten
path
he
propose
that
i
found
a
behavioral
research
center
to
focus
on
gene
expression
in
the
brain
the
phenomenon
of
different
gene
switch
on
in
different
cell
the

s
express

direct
the
production
of
particular
mix
of
protein
which
in
turn
differentiate
heart
cell
from
skin
cell
or
tumor
cell
and
control
how
they
function
i
also
met
with
steve
friend
the
founder
of
a
cut
edge
seattle
genome
analysis
company
he
too
thought
the
time
be
ripe
for
a
facility
at
the
crossroad
of
human
psychology
genomics
behavioral
genetics
and
brain
biology
advance
in
data
storage
and

would
enable
us
to
compile
and
analyze
the
mass
of
new

we
gather
the
more
i
read
about

how
the

i
come
to
the

with
a
rough
vision
of
an
institute
on
the
frontier
of
brain
science
one
expert
suggest
that
i
establish
a

i
be
wary

institute
scientist
of

pursue
whatever
they
find

be
not
easily
steer
i
have
see
the
downside
of
a
loosely
define
organizational
mission
at
interval
research
which
vulcan
have
close
two
year
earlier
and
i
wasn
t
eager
to
repeat
it
the
alternative
be
to
concentrate
on
a
single
large
scale
endeavor
that
might
transform
the
field
a
neuroscience
equivalent
to
the

we
d
have
concrete
milestone
en

to
tangible

within

i
want
a

run
on
an
industrial
scale
with
biotech
urgency
but
without
the
profit
motive
my
guest
debate
what
exactly
our
institute
should
address
the
discussion
be
lively
wide
range
and
often
competitive
great

be
adept
at
put

it

what
they
do

for

how
could
we
improve

technology
what
single
disease
might
be
most
usefully
explore
by
the
second
day
the
conversation
kept
circle
back
to
the
idea
that
have
first
surface
in
my
talk
with
watson
and
friend
what
neuroscience
need
more
than
anything
else
i
kept
hearing
be
something
very
basic
a
well
map
of
the

in
exist
map
relate
to
gene
expression
the
anatomic
resolution
be
too
coarse
to
be
of
much
help
in
decipher
how
the

really
work
the
national
institute
of
health
have
recently
fund
a
brain
molecular
anatomy
project
but
the
work
be
too
fragment
for
consistent
quality
control
and
there
be
only
enough
funding
to
look
at
six
hundred
gene
per
year
at
that
rate
a
complete
atlas
might
take
half
a
century
brain
mapping
be
stuck
in
a
cottage
industry
stage
like
the
one
that
hobble
genome
sequence
before
the
hgp
and
craig
venter
s
celera
genomics
make
the
effort
systematic
by
our
closing
session
the
scientist
be
unanimous
a
brain
atlas
be
an
appropriate
inaugural
project
for
the
allen
institute
because
of
the
incalculable
contribution
the
atlas
can
make
towards
solve
basic
molecular
and
genetic
question
about
human
behavior
the
atlas
would
link
genetics
and
anatomy
with
map
of
switch
on
gene
overlie
the
brain
s
three
dimensional
structure
it
would
open
new
avenue
of
research
into
neurological
and
psychiatric
disorder
as
well
as
fundamental
question
of
brain
science
our
initial
effort
the
scientist
agree
should
map
the
adult
mouse
brain
and
focus
on
healthy
specimen
most
study
be
then
look
at
embryonic
brain
and
nih
research
emphasize

a
brain
atlas
of
gene
expression
fit
my
main
criterion
to
go
where
important
work
lay
undone
it
be
big

with
obvious
real

begin
to
find

about

her

at

she

it
then
come
a
long

with

i
saw
the

up

i

if
there

anything
i

turn
fifty
the

i
write
that

the
point
in

where
many

i
launch
the

science
with
a
million

its
charter
be
ambitious
we
believe
this
be
a
historic
opportunity
to
unite
the
genome

the

and
use
the
data

to
tackle
the
challenge
of

our

would
serve
on
an
advisory

the
high
hurdle
for
a

the
sheer

the

success
have
to
be
measure
by

for
example
you
be
look
at
a

to
painkiller
like
morphine
and
want
to
know
just

a

for
work
on
a

that

where
we
come
in
our

technique
enable
us
to
look

deeply
into

to
focus
in
particular
on
gene
that
be
normally
express

in

we
could
then
tell
if
those
cell
be
in
the
right
place
in
autistic
child
or
not
in
essence
we
could
trace
autism
s
fingerprint
we
begin
by
section
brain
tissue
from
both
the
autistic

twenty
five

we
then
study
more

two
thousand

to
compare
those
gene
expression
in
the
autistic

we
expect
to
find

we
do
but
we
be
surprised
by
the
form
they
take

that
be
unusually
dense

yet
show
a

call
them

the

most
of
the

be
easy
to
overlook
in

follow
the

we
compromise

we
re

out
that
human

be
primarily
control
not
just
by
the

but
even
more
so
by
the
physical

pathway
that
excite

of

most
current

in
this

be
limited
to
effort
to
define

our
goal
be
to
tackle
the

and
to
illustrate
in

how

and
the

set
could
run
as
large
as
several
quadrillion

but
if
we
succeed
this
kind
of
diagram
could
dramatically
expand
our
knowledge
of
how
nerve
cell
communication
be
alter
by

and
how
new

might
most
effectively
intervene
during
my
first
flush
of
excitement
over
the

i
met
eric
kandel
the
columbia
university
neuroscientist
who
won
the
nobel
prize
in
physiology
or
medicine
for
his
work
on
memory
storage
in
neuron
i
told
him
we
re
go
to
know
so
much
more
about
the
brain
in
the
next
ten
year
dr
kandel
gently
apply
the
brake
i
ve
be
work
in
this
field
for
fifty
year
he
say
and
not
in
my
lifetime
and
probably
not
in
yours
will
we
understand
the
brain
i
be
remind
of
a
question
i
d
put
to
the
assemble
luminary
at
our
charrette
how
many
nobel
prize
will
need
to
be
won
in
neuroscience
before
we
really
know
how
the
brain
work
their
response
range
between
twenty
five
and
fifty
that
s
a
long
long
way
from
here
in
the
meantime
i
m
confident
that
our
atlas
will
help
those
future
laureate
and
speed
them
on
their
way
chapter
adventure
i
wasn
t
raise
as
an
adventurer
as
a
child
i
travel
through

the
way
my
mother
do
the
pile
of
national
geographic
in
our
basement
depict
the
large
world
out
there
but
i
didn
t
envision
myself
as
a
globetrotter
then
as
a
young
man
at
microsoft
i
simply
lack
the
time
to
explore
all
that
change
when
i
become
ill
at
twenty
nine
i
start
scuba
dive
in
hawaii
i
come
to
love
france
and
its
culture
and
cuisine
so
different
from
what
i
d
know
still
the
last
thing
i
thought
i
d
ever
own
be
a
yacht
here
be
my
image
of
boat
a
society
of
snob
who
drank
scotch
and
smoke
cigar
and
wore
double
breast
blazer
and
captain
s
hat
i
want
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
friend
kept
tell
me
about
the
great
trip
they
d
have
to
alaska
and
that
the
only
way
to
do
it
be
to
charter
a
boat
in
i
rent
an
eighty
five
footer
and
take
my
family
up
the
inside
passage
we
saw
a
whale
swim
underneath
us
and
many
others
spout
we
din
on
fresh
spot
prawn
bought
from
passing
fisherman
in
anan
bay
we
watch
bear
gorge
on
salmon
swim
upstream
so
numerous
that
as
the
indian
say
go
you
could
have
walk
across
the
water
on
their
back
i
have
the
time
of
my
life
a
boat
seem
like
the
best
possible
way
to
share
my
budding
passion
for
exploration
not
to
mention
a
terrific
platform
for
my
newfound
passion
for
scuba
dive
the
follow
year
i
be
able
to
buy
charade
foot
long
and
five
hundred
ton
with
a
crew
of
ten
it
have
five
stateroom
and
a
jacuzzi
up
top
i
thought
my
gosh
i
m
buying
more
boat
than
i
ll
need
fast
forward
to
a
few
year
later
when
my
captain
say
what
s
your
ultimate
boat
paul
i
told
him
that
i
d
be
absorbed
by
the
undersea
world
ever
since
my
parent
take
me
to
see
jacques
cousteau
s
the
silent
world
one
of
the
first
documentary
with
underwater
color
cinematography
include
shot
from
a
twoman
submarine
i
say
that
i
d
love
to
have
my
own
sub
to
take
my
exploration
literally
down
to
the
next
level
while
i
wasn
t
after
size
for
its
own
sake
a
big
boat
could
accommodate
more
of
my
friend
on
our
far
flung
journey
i
also
want
to
upgrade
my
onboard
record
studio
with
a
full
digital
console
dave
stewart
have
an
idea
for
a
shipboard
concert
stage
with
audience
seat
on
the
aft
deck
that
s
how
octopus
be
born
in
the
spirit
of
cousteau
s
underwater
adventure
i
go
to
espen
ino
the
naval
architect
base
in
monaco
and
they
create
a
two
foot
model
that
look
reasonable
then
the
work
start
it
take
a
full
year
for
more
than
a
hundred
draftspeople
to
design
octopus
and
three
year
more
for
two
company
to
construct
it
midway
through
the
process
the
prime
contractor
invite
me
to
their
shipyard
in
kiel
germany
to
show
me
how
they
built
submarine
for
the
german
and
turkish
navy
one
of
them
have
a
torpedo
which
pique
my
interest
at
the
end
of
the
tour
i
ask
them
deadpan
could
i
add
a
torpedo
tube
to
my
yacht
the
two
engineer
look
at
each
other
and
you
could
see
the
deutsche
mark
sign
go
off
in
their
head
one
of
them
say
ja
ja
we
can
add
the
tube
it
s
possible
to
add
the
tube
ja
i
let
the
image
hang
in
the
air
for
a
few
moment
before
tell
them
i
be
joking
and
the
guy
nod
his
head
and
say
ja
we
could
have
add
the
tube
but
get
the
license
for
the
torpedo
that
would
have
be
difficult
i
ve
own
a
couple
of
other
yacht
meduse
and
tatoosh
but
i
be
stun
by
the
sheer
size
of
octopus
when
it
be
deliver
in
at
foot
it
be
a
third
longer
than
a
football
field
more
than
twenty
yard
wide
seven
story
high
at
the
time
it
be
the
fourth
large
yacht
in
the
world
with
the
top
three
built
for
head
of
state
as
the
yacht
industry
continue
to
extend
the
realm
of
the
possible
octopus
have
drop
in
the
ranking
and
be
now
ninth
large
overall
it
have
a
full
time
crew
of
more
than
fifty
and
the
most
advanced
nautical
technology
when
i
first
stood
on
the
bridge
i
felt
as
though
i
be
on
a
spaceship
it
take
me
six
month
to
get
use
to
own
something
of
that
scale
but
over
the
year
since
octopus
have
realize
every
mission
i
have
in
mind
for
her
all
my
passion
come
together
in
one
moveable
feast
a
basketball
court
a
movie
theater
a
swim
pool
the
record
studio
have
ocean
view
in
all
direction
and
be
painstakingly
soundproofed
from
engine
noise
and
vibration
it
s
about
as
good
musically
as
any
in
the
world
dave
stewart
have
record
there
and
so
have
mick
jagger
u
once
previewed
their
late
album
on
board
and
played
it
so
loud
that
they
burn
out
the
speaker
we
ve
have
too
many
phenomenal
jam
in
that
space
to
count
each
year
we
host
a
shipboard
party
during
the
cannes
film
festival
and
the
studio
becomes
a
bandstand
but
while
octopus
be
ideal
for
get
togethers
musical
and
otherwise
my
very
favorite
spot
on
the
boat
might
be
the
most
intimate
one
a
little
aerie
that
seat
a
few
people
in
total
quiet
at
the
very
top
i
ve
look
out
over
the
venice
rooftop
from
there
and
the
factory
and
naval
yard
along

even
seem
to
have
a
sense
of
communal
responsibility
there

when
they
be
two
and
three
year
old

if
you
take
a
morning
walk
with
one
of
them
you
may
find
a
trunk
lightly
touch
your
shoulder
like
a
friend
place
his
arm
around
you
it
s
call
beaking
in
the
wild
though
they
be
a
force
to
be
reckon
with
as
we
discover
on
our
first
trip
to
that
country
in
it
be
winter
there
when
male
elephant
be
often
in
musth
a
hormonal
condition
that
s
equivalent
to
a
female
go
into
heat
they
secrete
a
pungent
discharge
from
the
side
of
their
head
and
be
unusually
aggressive
when
our
land
rover
be
a
mile
or
so
from
camp
we
spot
an
enormous
bull
elephant
fifty
yard
away
chomp
his
way
through
the
grass
our
driver
say
i
m
go
to
drive
right
past
him
and
i
d
never
do
this
before
but
i
say
no
he
look
upset
let
s
stop
and
let
him
eat
there
be
something
about
the
bull
s
body
language
that
bother
me
the
elephant
kept
eat
till
it
be
almost
past
us
and
then
our
driver
get
restless
and
put
the
land
rover
in
gear
the
bull
promptly
wheel
and
charge
at
full
speed
from
thirty
yard
it
must
have
weigh
twelve
thousand
pound
twice
as
much
as
our
vehicle
in
a
collision
we
would
come
out
second
best
everyone
s
head
swivel
toward
me
as
though
i
d
know
what
to
do
next
but
i
be
a
rookie
too
and
i
have
no
idea
as
the
elephant
close
to
ten
yard
a
veteran
guide
name
sandor
carter
sprang
into
action
he
jumped
up
threw
his
arm
over
his
head
and
shout
knock
it
off
the
elephant
pull
up
and

by
get
big
our
guide
have
make
it
clear
that
we
would
assert
ourselves
lead
the
bull
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
do
battle
the
most
memorable
part
of
our
trip
come
in
kenya
s
enormous
rift
valley
where
we
stayed
by
the
maasai
mara
game
reserve
from
a
helicopter
or
hot
air
balloon
there
be
zebra
and
gazelle
and
wildebeest
as
far
as
you
can
see
they
move
in
concert
like
a
living
lawn
mower
up
from
the
serengeti
and
back
down
again
in
a
circular
path
pride
of
lion
lie
at
rest
wait
for
the
dark
and
a
tasty
wildebeest
dinner
the
maasai
be
a
nomadic
people
who
cling
to
tradition
even
as
they
ve
begin
to
use
cell
phone
as
part
of
an
animal
conservancy
that
we
ve
support
they
have
agree
to
let
more
wild
animal
return
to
the
tribe
s
grazing
land
in
exchange
for
a
share
of
government
tourist
fee
which
in
turn
help
build
school
and
basic
infrastructure
one
night
in
a
barren
salt
plain
close
to
the
tanzania
border
we
celebrate
a
new
dam
that
we
d
fund
to
bring
water
to
the
maasai
and
their
livestock
cattle
be
their
primary
asset
and
also
a
source
of
protein
in
their
milk
and
cow
s
blood
tonic
we
set
up
a
stage
on
the
reddish
crack
earth
moonscape
with
portable
generator
under
an
orange
canopy
by
late
afternoon
we
have
a
crowd
of
more
than
a
thousand
maasai
who
d
walk
dozen
of
mile
to
get
there
i
be
with
my
band
and
our
special
feature
singer
dan
aykroyd
a
kindred
spirit
and
true
lover
of
the
blue
whose
absurdist
humor
never
fails
to
crack
me
up
that
night
he
sang
and
played
harmonica
and
dance
as
only
dan
can
as
we
make
our
way
through
our
set
the
maasai
men
answer
by
jumping
in
their
red
and
orange
and
turquoise
robe
spear
in
hand
then
a
woman
s
clear
voice
sail
over
the
top
of
their
layer
chant
we
be
together
in
spirit
but
not
always
in
tempo
and
i
felt
the
urge
to
create
a
song
that
would
mix
our
two
culture
like
paul
simon
s
diamond
on
the
sol
of
her
shoe
but
that
s
not
something
you
can
do
on
the
spot
so
we
stuck
with
what
we
knew
halfway
through
dan
s
rendition
of
messin
with
the
kid
the
maasai
suddenly
switch
from
their
regional
chant
to
the
staccato
rhythm
of
our
song
they
even
change
their
dance
to
a
stomp
and
a
little
stutter
step
mimic
dan
and
they
sang
along
with
the
chorus
what
s
this
i
hear
well
there
s
a
whole
lot
of
talk
people
say
they
re
try
to
mess
with
the
kid
hey
hey
hey
it
be
transcendent
share
that
junior
well
song
with
the
maasai
on
the
salt
flat
a
few
bar
later
they
return
to
their
original
rhythm
but
we
all
felt
that
we
d
connect
the
sun
set
as
the
stage
light
come
on
every
six
legged
fly
thing
within
mile
converge
on
us
and
we
call
it
a
night
the
maasai
seem
delighted
for
most
it
be
their
first
live
encounter
with
the
low
frequency
of
a
bass
guitar
as
a
chief
told
us
afterward
i
like
your
music
because
i
could
feel
it
in
my
stomach
i
knew
just
what
he
meant
i
d
felt
the
same
way

first
time

in
an
inland

a
verdant
swampland
in
the
rainy

of

massive
its

blow
skip
say
you

down
and
stuck
my
nose
a
few
inch
from
those
razor
claw
the
smell
be
surprisingly
sweet
but
i
didn

push
my
luck
and
linger
too
long
in
i
return
to
africa
to
visit
the
bwindi

in

with
our
guide
use
machete
to
hack
a
path
through
the
dense
vegetation
our
party
of
five
trooped
down
into
a
sun
dapple
ravine
three
hour
in
we
spot
a
big
silverback
the
alpha
male
eight
hundred
pound
of
primate
muscle
knuckle
walk
up
the
slope
whenever
we
get
within
twenty
yard
he
d
move
on
not
want
to
be
bother
then
i
happen
to
look
up
directly
overhead
a
juvenile
gorilla
be
slide
down
a
moss
cover
tree
when
he
be
eight
foot
off
the
ground
just
a
few
yard
away
our
eye
make
contact
in
one
of
the
stranger
moment
of
recognition
i
ll
ever
have
then
the
gorilla
grabbed
a
vine
swung
into
the
brush
and
be
go
from
there
we
have
to
climb
farther
down
and
then
up
the
back
side
of
another
ravine
drench
with
sweat
in
the
misty
humidity
i
felt
unusually
tire
and
have
to
cling
to
a
staff
member
s
pack
to
get
up
the
last
series
of
hill
i
take
it
as
a
sign
that
i
be
out
of
shape
i
didn
t
know
that
i
d
soon
face
the
most
challenge
period
of
my
life
two
day
later
after
our
tour
boat
skim
past
colony
of
crocodile
and
stop
before
a
stun
waterfall
we
cast
our
line
for
some
nile
perch
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
have
collapse
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
i
immediately
go
back
to
seattle
where
i
have
a
similar
episode
on
a
walk
around
green
lake
i
felt
odd
and
sat
down
to
have
a
drink
and
then
i
couldn
t
get
up
an
emergency
room
ekg
found
an
arrhythmia
that
call
for
an
immediate
heart
valve
replacement
that
weekend
i
be
in
surgery
i
woke
up
fit
with
some
internal
technology
my
pacemaker
then
one
problem
lead
to
another
as
fluid
built
up
in
my
left
lung
in
march
i
have
the
bill
clinton
surgery
in
which
they
deflate
the
lung
and
peel
off
scar
tissue
it
go
great
the
surgeon
told
me
everything
s
go
to
be
fine
but
during
a
trip
to
jordan
a
few
month
later
i
become
so
short
of
breath
that
i
could
hardly
make
it
up
a
flight
of
stair
after
a
buildup
of
fluid
in
my
other
lung
a
chest
biopsy
reveal
non
hodgkin
s
lymphoma
the
disease
that
have
so
terrify
me
when
i
be
misdiagnosed
as
a
young
man
i
have
the
most
treatable
variety
but
the
cancer
be
so
aggressive
that
it
have
already
reach
stage
iv
spread
beyond
the
lymph
node
i
be
feel
far
bad
than
i
have
with
hodgkin
s
and
i
thought
my
number
be
up
that
the
deadly
threat
i
d
dodge
twenty
five
year
earlier
have
finally
caught
up
with
me
my
internist
be
optimistic
my
oncologist
more
down
the
middle
the
standard
chemotherapy
be
a
cocktail
call
r
chop
which
include
a
monoclonal
antibody
to
stimulate
the
body
s
immune
system
with
luck
it
would
eradicate
the
lymphoma
though
the
odds
of
a
cure
be
less
than
percent
in
november
i
begin
treatment
six
round
of
chemo
with
three
week
between
each
round
it
take
about
six
hour
to
pump
a
dose
of
r
chop
into
you
and
i
stayed
overnight
in
the
hospital
the
first
time
to
make
sure
i
could
tolerate
the
treatment
aside
from
a
mild
allergic
reaction
that
turn
the
top
of
my
head
bright
red
everything
else
be
normal
chemotherapy
make
your
body
a
battleground
and
the
first
cycle
kill
so
many
tumor
cell
that
it
stress
your
kidney
there
wasn
t
any
nausea
but
the
fatigue
be
intense
and
last
for
day
each
time
early
on
i
thought
i
could
hunker
down
and
handle
everything
myself
but
it
be
a
bad
idea
to
be
alone
night
be
the
bad
jody
be
terrifically
supportive
and
come
over
each
even
to
watch
movie
i
appreciate
the
company
though
her
choice
of
program
left
something
to
be
desire
she
recommend
a
bbc
miniseries
of
a
dickens
novel
and
at
least
one
or
two
character
die
of
tuberculosis
in
each
episode
boy
this
be
really
bleak
i
complain
what
do
you
expect
jody
say
it
s
bleak
house
throughout
this
difficult
period
one
of
my
most
regular
visitor
be
bill
gate
he
be
everything
you
d
want
from
a
friend
care
and
concerned
i
be
remind
of
the
complexity
of
our
relationship
and
how
we
always
root
for
each
other
even
when
we
be
barely
speak
it
seem
that
we
d
be
stuck
with
one
another
for
as
long
as
we
last
i
d
begin
work
in
earnest
on
this
book
and
there
be
day
when
i
fear
that
i
d
never
see
it
in
print
it
be
only
after
the
second
round
of
chemo
when
my
scan
come
back
nearly
clean
that
i
have
any
confidence
that
i
might
actually
pull
through
in
late
april
after
my
sixth
and
final
round
i
nervously
await
the
result
of
another
pair
of
scan
that
phone
call
be
euphoric
i
be
officially
in
remission
i
wasn
t
totally
back
to
normal
however
the
tip
of
my
finger
be
slightly
numb
for
a
while
from
the
treatment
which
didn
t
improve
my
guitar
play
it
take
month
after
the
end
of
chemo
before
you
feel
completely
normal
again
my
illness
didn
t
turn
my
head
around
the
way
hodgkin
s
have
but
it
have
left
its
mark
i
want
more
than
ever
to
cram
as
much
as
i
can
into
life
shortly
before
my
last
treatment
i
travel
to
tahiti
for
my
first
scuba
dive
in
three
year
it
go
fine
though
my
pacemaker
limited
me
to
a
foot
descent
i
might
go
back
for
an
upgrade
to
a
model
rat
for
foot
a
week
after
my
last
report
i
go
white
water
raft
in
utah
s
cataract
canyon
i
love
the
red
rock
canyon
land
and
the
one
day
out
sound
harmless
enough
fail
to
check
the
fine
print
i
hadn
t
realize
that
i
d
have
to
splash
through
twenty
nine
separate
rapid
over
a
two
hour
span
or
that
we
d
get
batter
by
the
storm
of
the
year
with
horizontal
rain
and
forty
mile
an
hour
wind
that
trip
wasn
t
the
smartest
thing
i
d
ever
do
and
it
left
me
with
a
touch
of
pneumonia
but
it
also
affirm
that
i
be
very
much
alive
recently

annual

to
help
preserve
endanger
old

back
to
my

passion
for
green
thing
and
his
love
of
the
outdoors
when
you

flash
back
to
how
it
all
start
for
him
i
be
mainly
a
writer
he
say
but
then
they
ask
me
to
do
one
of
the
first
skit
play
a
home
security
technician
who
break
into
a
home
to
show
a
terrify
couple
john
belushi
and
gilda
radner
that
they
need
his
service
dan
admit
he
be
nervous
but
the
skit
go
great
when
i
come
off
the
stage
i
knew
that
i
d
found
what
i
want
to
do
i
know
that
feel
i
found
my
own
path
when
i
help
create
altair
basic
in
that
two
month
rush
of
creativity
back
in
later
when
the
ibm
pc
ship
with
our
operating
system
at
its
core
it
struck
me
that
the
code
i
have
help
to
write
would
fundamentally
change
the
way
people
work
played
and
communicate
have
that
kind
of
impact
forever
change
your
sense
of
purpose
in
life
it
s
a
feel
you
ll
always
want
to
find
again
when
i
become
gravely
ill
in
my
twenty
i
found
myself
regret
that
my
life
be
so
narrowly
focus
but
after
i
recover
and
travel
the
world
i
soon
become
restless
i
discover
that
what
i
miss
most
be
create
thing
and
so
i
go
back
to
work
if
there
s
any
irony
to
my
life
it
s
that
my
time
with
microsoft
be
atypically
one
dimensional
when
i
be
young
i
immerse
myself
in
rocket
robot
music
and
chemistry
an
omnivorous
reader
i
thrill
to
the
exploit
of
pilot
and
explorer
i
be
inspire
by
thomas
edison
and
alexander
graham
bell
my
curiosity
be
boundless
i
go
on
to
spend
eight
driven
year
with
the
single
purpose
of
make
microsoft
the
leader
of
the
personal
computer
revolution
and
it
happen
far
beyond
what
i
could
have
hop
or
expect
but
my
old
passion
still
tug
at
me
defer
but
not
forgotten
they
be
squeeze
into
play
along
with
hendrix
at
three
in
the
morning
or
steal
a
weekend
from
cod
to
watch
a
momentous
spaceflight
after
i
left
microsoft
the
wealth
that
i
d
help
create
there
and
then
the
company
s
explosive
growth
freed
me
to
pick
up
where
i
have
left
off
at
time
i
cast
my
net
too
widely
but
my
choice
of
venture
wasn
t
arbitrary
most
of
them
be
seed
long
ago
in
my
youth
over
the
last
twenty
seven
year
i
ve
be
able
to
do
thing
i
once
only
imagine
i
have
now
live
half
my
life
post
microsoft
what
we
achieve
there
will
always
be
a
source
of
pride
but
my
second
act
in
all
its
range
and
variety
be
truer
to
my
nature
some
people
be
motivate
by
a
need
for
recognition
some
by
money
and
some
by
a
broad
social
goal
i
start
from
a
different
place
from
the
love
of
idea
and
the
urge
to
put
them
into
motion
and
see
where
they
might
lead
the
creative
path
be
rocky
with
the
risk
of
failure
ever
present
and
no
guarantee
but
even
with
its
detour
and
blind
alley
it
s
the
only
road
that
i
find
fulfil
from
early
on
in
the
microsoft
era
i
be
look
at
as
the
source
of
seminal
idea
these
day
my
role
be
often
to
listen
to
smart
people
and
recognize
when
something
special
have
emerge
then
i
try
to
place
the
thought
into
a
new
context
or
extend
it
into
something
more
powerful
as
we
do
in
our
neuroscience
charrette
the
idea
of
a
genetic
brain
map
have
be
bat
about
in
many
private
meeting
but
it
crystallize
when
a
dozen
top
scientist
come
together
and
engage
in
a
free
flow
of
idea
the
allen
brain
atlas
a
product
of
their
consensus
emerge
as
the
most
persuasive
way
to
move
the
field
forward
few
thing
worth
do
can
be
do
alone
to
get
past
the
conceptual
stage
idea
need
to
become
crusade
you
ve
get
to
convince
people
to
join
you
i
be
lucky
right
off
the
bat
to
find
bill
gate
whose
passion
for
business
match
mine
for
track
technology
later
i
d
be
fortunate
to
meet
bert
rutan
en
route
to
spaceshipone
and
to
find
allan
jones
to
lead
our
brain
work
i
ve
also
see
what
can
happen
when
the
right
team
isn
t
in
place
how
the
best
idea
can
founder
i
make
more
mistake
in
pursue
the
wire
world
than
i
can
count
but
the
first
and
bad
be
this
i
often
fail
to
find
the
right
people
to
help
me
execute
my
vision
my
own
history
probably
swayed
me
to
take
a
flier
on
some
with
slim
track
record
and
to
entrust
them
with
too
much
too
soon
since
then
i
have
learn
to
be
more
careful
talent
be
indeed
essential
but
season
and
maturity
be
not
to
be
underestimated
above
all
i
ve
learn
the
pitfall
of
get
so
lock
in
to
look
ahead
that
you
miss
the
pothole
that
make
you
stumble
or
the
iceberg
that
sink
you
still
any
crusade
require
optimism
and
the
ambition
to
aim
high
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
i
ve
want
to
find
my
own
challenge
see
them
through
to
fruition
and
if
everything
break
right
change
the
world
for
the
well
people
ask
how
wealth
have
change
me
it
s
a
question
i
find
difficult
to
answer
there
be
time
when
i
feel
unaffected
and
then
i
wonder
if
i
m
kid
myself
the
manifestation
of
wealth
home
boat
plane
have
clearly
alter
how
i
live
and
get
around
more
important
though
be
the
door
of
possibility
thrown
open
to
me
the
opportunity
i
ve
enjoy
yet
for
all
these
evident
change
the
people
i
ve
know
long
tell
me
that
i
m
much
the
same
in
the
way
that
matter
i
still
try
to
take
people
as
i
meet
them
and
i
m
still
a
dreamer
more
intrigue
by
what
might
be
doable
than
by
what
have
already
be
do
my
recent
illness
make
me
more
impatient
and
patient
simultaneously
it
be
a
harsh
reminder
that
there
be
no
time
to
waste
and
it
s
make
me
more
urgent
and
demand
of
myself
and
those
who
work
with
me
still
it
s
humble
to
await
the
result
of
a
pet
scan
and
know
that
you
can
t
make
the
clock
wind
faster
i
ve
come
to
realize
that
many
thing
happen
at
their
own
pace
beyond
your
control
from
the
development
of
a
young
point
guard
to
the
trial
of
a
potential
alzheimer
s
therapy
i
m
learn
to
be
less
harry
in
anticipation
and
more
accept
of
each
necessary
incremental
step
i
do
my
best
to
keep
up
with
science
technology
and
current
affair
and
most
of
my
reading
now
take
place
online
i
want
to
keep
stretch
the
boundary
of
the
possible
i
want
my
think
to
stay
forward
look
and
unconstrained
what
be
next
that
s
a
question
that
will
never
get
old
for
me
i
ll
always
be
on
the
hunt
for
the
next
big
idea
and
there
s
one
more
thing
that
hasn
t
change
i
m
still
fascinate
by
the
inner
working
of
machine
of
all
sort
i
still
love
to
delve
into
their
intricacy
at
a
minute
level
of
detail
i
m
do
it
with
the
allen
institute
s
journey
to
understand
the
human
brain
the
most
complex
mechanism
in
the
history
of
the
planet
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
i
m
just
now
consider
a
new
initiative
with
that
magical
contraption
i
never
weary
of
sketch
as
a
boy
the
rocket
ship
someone
after
all
be
