prologue
one
day
in
january
no
one
be
happy
when
i
be
chosen
as
nokia
s
ceo
on
january
nokia
s
share
value
immediately
slump
by
ten
percent
end
the
day
four
percent
down
that
told
us
what
investor
thought
of
my
prospect
commentator
thought
i
be
too
young
i
be
then
forty
one
and
too
inexperienced
to
lead
a
great
finnish
company
nokia
s
employee
fear
the
bad
a
former
banker
and
finance
director
have
be
parachute
into
the
smolder
ruin
to
salvage
what
he
could
and
sell
it
to
the
high
bidder
my
family
s
view
be
that
i
have
take
on
an
impossible
task
they
expect
it
would
take
over
my
life
completely
so
that
my
three
child
would
be
lucky
to
see
me
late
in
the
even
if
then
perhaps
the
next
time
they
saw
me
would
be
on
our
summer
holiday
all
in
all
a
promising
start
i
have
to
turn
this
around
make
it
positive
i
thought
as
i
left
nokia
s
head
office
that
dark
even
i
myself
be
happy
even
though
others
disap
prove
of
my
appointment
at
least
there
be
an
end
to
the
dither
and
uncertainty
i
have
my
own
idea
on
what
nokia
s
ceo
should
do
even
so
i
have
barely
the
faintest
idea
of
what
i
have
let
myself
in
for
this
make
life
ea
ier
i
have
board
a
roller
coaster
whose
terrify
swoop
loop
and
dip
i
could
never
even
have
imagine
if
someone
have
jumped
into
the
car
beside
me
and
told
me
the
success
story
nokia
would
be
i
wouldn
t
have
believe
them
if
someone
have
ask
me
what
kind
of
future
i
expect
for
nokia
i
d
have
reply
i
haven
t
a
clue
if
that
be
i
d
be
compel
to
be
honest
if
someone
could
have
described
just
how
bad
my
most
difficult
time
at
nokia
would
feel
i
wouldn
t
have
believe
it
or
if
i
have
believe
it
i
would
xviii
jorma
ollila
prologue
and
harri
saukkomaa
have
revoke
my
decision
to
take
on
leadership
of
a
company
sinking
under
the
weight
of
its
financial
problem
i
be
captain
of
a
vessel
where
only
the
bridge
remain
above
the
waterline
the
hull
be
already
submerge
and
water
be
come
into
the
engine
room
the
previous
ceo
have
be
sack
after
fall
out
with
the
chairman
who
have
then
retire
the
chairman
before
him
have
commit
suicide
after
that
there
d
be
an
attempt
to
sell
nokia
to
the
swedish
firm
erics
son
which
have
be
wise
enough
to
decline
the
offer
no
wonder
then
that
morale
within
the
company
be
at
rock
bottom
my
appointment
as
nokia
s
ceo
would
mark
the
end
of
one
era
in
the
firm
s
history
and
the
start
of
a
new
one
i
do
not
however
yet
know
that
back
in
i
knew
only
that
the
previous
generation
have
tasked
me
with
rebuild
the
company
they
have
all
but
destroyed
nor
of
course
could
i
know
that
i
would
lead
nokia
for
over
fourteen
year
at
that
time
i
didn
t
dare
think
as
far
as
six
month
ahead
when
i
be
offer
the
top
job
at
nokia
i
have
remark
to
my
wife
liisa
that
it
be
a
position
one
could
lose
at
a
moment
s
notice
the
shareholder
might
have
have
enough
the
investor
could
withdraw
their
money
or
the
company
s
share
price
could
fall
so
low
that
it
could
be
snap
up
like
a
tasty
snack
our
competitor
perhaps
be
happy
with
my
appointment
they
thought
the
nokia
story
be
in
its
final
chapter
otherwise
a
former
finance
director
would
not
have
be
chosen
the
company
would
quickly
be
sell
either
as
a
whole
or
in
small
parcel
all
our
competitor
have
to
do
be
await
nokia
s
disintegration
and
it
would
be
ready
for
pluck
my
compatriot
be
scarcely
happy
with
my
appointment
i
have
be
a
student
politician
and
after
that
i
have
work
in
an
american
bank
these
be
not
plus
point
student
politician
be
basically
unsound
and
it
would
have
be
more
patriotic
to
have
work
in
a
finnish
bank
many
people
in
finland
have
no
idea
who
i
be
my
background
be
unusual
for
a
chief
executive
finn
might
well
ask
what
this
forty
one
year
old
engineer
and
economist
knew
about
factory
or
the
life
of
the
people
who
work
in
them
it
be
a
good
question
in
their
position
i
d
have
ask
it
too
i
come
across
as
an
impatient
smartly
dress
banker
with
a
stubborn
look
and
an
excellent
memory
for
figure
i
have
so
much
self
confidence
that
i
have
no
idea
how
many
way
there
be
for
me
to
fail
as
nokia
s
ceo
i
be
ready
to
roll
up
my
sleeve
and
get
down
to
work
lot
of
work
i
could
do
it
and
i
would
enjoy
it
but
on
its
own
it
be
not
enough
i
also
have
to
find
something
that
would
enable
both
nokia
and
me
to
survive
i
have
to
find
good
people
who
would
believe
in
the
company
i
have
to
breathe
new
prologue
against
all
odds
xix
life
into
the
company
so
that
people
would
believe
in
themselves
other
wise
we
would
be
lose
in
that
sea
where
lie
so
many
shipwreck
company
whose
name
no
one
remembers
i
and
a
few
other
manager
of
my
age
at
nokia
have
a
dream
as
a
dream
it
be
perhaps
a
little
mundane
of
the
sort
one
can
actually
put
into
effect
we
look
around
us
and
saw
that
finland
and
the
finnish
economy
be
close
to
collapse
we
look
at
nokia
and
we
notice
that
the
company
have
not
be
lead
properly
nevertheless
we
knew
that
nokia
be
a
fine
company
we
knew
that
this
company
which
have
be
give
to
us
to
lead
could
clearly
do
well
than
before
we
want
to
demonstrate
that
to
the
whole
world
this
be
an
account
of
our
time
at

during
its
transformation
from
an
old
fashion
finnish
conglomerate
to
a
global
enterprise

the
story
of
how
by
chance
i
become

nokia

i
should
have
be
a
physicist
or
an
economist
it

an
account
of
our
team

people
of
nokia
who
set
out
to
follow
an
everyday
dream
it
s
a
story
of
exceptional
success
but
at
the
same
time
of
the
poor
judgment
we
sometimes
show
and
the
bad
decision

her
study
and
return
to
ostrobothnia
with
my
father
my
mother
be
enchant
beautiful
and
clever
she
have
large
soft
in
quiring
eye
a
high
forehead
and
dark
wavy
hair
her
bright
smile
lit
up
the
whole
world
though
now
and
then
she
would
gaze
yearningly
into
the
distance
she
didn
t
look
finnish
she
seem
to
have
a
drop
of
italian
blood
and
a
dash
of
mediterranean
warmth
i
be
the
eldest
and
a
boy
so
i
have
no
need
to
compete
for
my
mother
s
favor
i
be
always
the
apple
of
her
eye
the
focus
of
love
and
her
trusty
helper
my
sister
leena
be
born
two
year
later
but
i
didn
t
have
to
compete
with
her
because
she
be
a
girl
i
be
very
much
my
mother
s
boy
from
the
begin
and
right
up
until
her
death
as
the
eldest
i
naturally
have
responsibility
as
well
as
privilege
i
not
only
have
to
look
after
myself
but
my
young
sibling
too
my
parent
didn
t
al
way
have
much
time
to
spare
for
me
and
it
be
assume
i
could
look
after
myself
i
have
family
responsibility
i
have
to
organize
the
other
child
to
do
their
chore
and
it
be
assume
i
would
speak
up
for
them
with
our
parent
and
i
be
expect
to
set
a
good
example
our
mother
exude
a
quiet
charisma
which
i
have
come
to
appreciate
more
and
more
over
the
year
she
always
make
me
do
my
best
and
expect
good
result
though
these
demand
be
never
spoken
i
understood
them
perfectly
well
from
her
demeanor
and
solicitude
i
realize
i
be
expect
to
do
well
and
i
try
to
live
up
to
those
expectation
my
mother
accom
plished
that
she
support
me
in
my
study
she
respect
knowledge
and
education
and
she
have
her
own
reason
for
that
my
mother
s
family
be
from
isokyr
not
far
from
my
father
s
family
home
generation
after
generation
have
live
in
the
area
so
my
entire
clan
as
far
back
as
the
sixteenth
century
be
of
ostrobothnian
farm
stock
my
mother
grow
up
in
modest
surroundings
with
seven
brother
and
sister
her
father
be
isak
isakinpoika
kallio
a
fantastically
obstinate
farmer
who
hat
the
gentry
and
all
its
work
he
have
decide
that
none
of
his
child
should
go
to
secondary
school
because
they
would
be
expose
to
bad
influ
ences
there
my
mother
be
the
second
young
child
and
her
father
die
before
she
reach
school
age
so
my
mother
do
after
all
have
the
chance
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
of
an
education
she
become
the
first
of
her
family
to
graduate
from
high
school
she
would
certainly
have
graduate
from
university
have
she
not
met
my
father
and
start
a
family
with
him
my
father
be
tall
lean
and
hard
work
he
be
a
little
unusual
be
cause
he
talk
a
lot
except
about
the
war
on
which
he
be
silent
he
be
a
war
hero
who
have
receive
medal
for
his
part
in
the
battle
of
taipale
he
have
serve
as
a
field
artillery
officer
but
he
never
talk
much
about
that
time
and
certainly
never
boast
it
wasn
t
until
his
grandson
my
son
come
along
that
he
open
up
about
his
experience
of
war
for
decade
after
the
war
it
be
simply
not
the
do
thing
to
talk
about
it
and
it
be
not
in
my
father
s
nature
to
do
so
he
have
do
his
duty
on
the
front
and
there
be
no
need
to
go
on
about
it
my
father
work
non
stop
planning
and
building
he
always
have
many
iron
in
the
fire
through
him
i
become
interested
in
a
thousand
different
thing
which
cause
problem
in
later
life
when
i
have
to
focus
on
just
one
thing
at
a
time
where
we
live
men
have
the
right
to
take
an
interest
in
what
ever
take
their
fancy
while
woman
be
expect
to
clear
up
after
them
my
mother
do
all
the
housework
as
be
usual
in
finland
in
the
fifty
when
i
be
born
my
mother
be
twenty
four
and
my
father
twenty
eight
year
old
we
all
live
at
my
grandfather
s
house
in
kurikka
where
the
grow
family
have
to
squeeze
into
two
room
we
share
the
ground
floor
with
some
other
relative
while
my
grandfather
live
upstairs
my
father
begin
work
in
the
family
electrical
business
which
my
grandfather
must
have
expect
him
to
take
over
eventually
there
be
a
real
sense
of
purpose
my
home
background
taught
me
that
one
must
work
and
work
hard
if
one
intend
to
succeed
in
life
my
grand
father
work
very
hard
in
his
business
and
my
father
work
seven
day
a
week
my
mother
toil
at
home
look
after
our
grow
family
and
she
taught
in
the
village
school
as
well
as
well
as
his
paid
work
my
father
devote
a
lot
of
time
to
his
own
project
he
design
the
electrical
wiring
for
other
people
s
house
and
built
house
and
summer
cottage
there
be
enough
work
to
fill
every
wake
moment
and
every
wake
moment
be
fill
with
it
work
be
as
natural
as
breathing
leave
work
undone
or
enjoy
moment
of
creative
leisure
be
consider
unnatural
that
be
laziness
the
start
of
a
slippery
slope
it
might
lead
to
vodka
drinking
which
be
one
of
the
deadliest
sin
village
brawl
and
domestic
violence
be
common
to
ostrobothnian
life
people
be
judged
by
their
ability
to
work
a
good
worker
be
the
fine
compliment
you
could
pay
someone
work
well

against
all
odds
sit
on
my
father
s
lap
with
my
sister
leena
in
kurikka
be
link
to
another
value
autonomy
people
should
stand
on
their
own
two
foot
and
make
their
own
way
in
life
the
people
i
grow
up
with
thought
you
could
never
do
too
much
work
while
leisure
time
be
a
potentially
fatal
menace
it
be
just
this
mindset
that
enable
finland
to
become
a
developed
country
there
be
parallel
with
the
develop
economy
of
southeast
asia
i
see
there
a
mindset
familiar
from
my
childhood
work
enables
one
to
get
on
in
life
to
achieve
prosperity
and
to
educate
one
s
child
for
a
well
life
i
learn
this
from
my
parent
and
when
life
be
full
of
thing
to
be
do
at
least
it
isn
t
dull
my
mother
believe
in
god
some
of
her
family
be
pietists
who
wore
black
and
sang
psalm
i
remember
as
a
boy
in
short
trouser
take
part
in
pietist
meeting
god
wasn
t
really
mention
at
home
though
we
go
to
church
at
christmas
for
christening
and
for
funeral
my
parent
be
more
interested
in
natural
history
than
in
religion
there
be
many
book
about
geography
and
natural
history
on
our
shelf
and
we
have
encyclope
dia
and
map
and
illustrate
book
of
natural
wonder
but
the
family
only
begin
to
read
novel
in
the
s
we
read
the
literary
classic
but
science
book
be
regard
as
a
well
use
of
time
arithmetic
and
math
be
part
of
everyday
life
and
our
family
regard
ed
them
as
positively
virtuous
my
parent
always
assume
their
child
would
have
no
difficulty
with
math
they
didn
t
even
bother
to
look
at
the
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
grade
we
get
for
math
for
they
knew
they
would
always
be
the
top
score
my
grandfather
s
skill
with
figure
have
be
pass
down
to
my
father
and
then
to
me
and
my
sibling
and
my
mother
be
also
know
for
her
math
ematical
ability
i
be
keen
on
mathematics
from
a
very
early
age
and
i
demand
high
standard
of
accuracy
from
myself
later
i
demand
them
from
others
surely
you
know
your
own
number
i
would
say
to
subordi
nates
who
get
their
figure
mixed
up
when
reporting
result
number
reveal
a
much
wider
world
number
meant
thing
and
thing
could
be
very
important
indeed
if
i
understood
the
number
i
would
understand
thing
as
well
if
i
understood
thing
i
could
control
the
world
when
the
number
be
clear
i
could
concentrate
on
the
reality
they
represent
then
i
could
achieve
something
new
all
this
become
clear
to
me
much
later
but
without
the
respect
my
father
and
mother
show
for
mathematics
i
would
not
be
the
person
i
be
now
we
live
in
that
small
apartment
in
my
grandfather
s
house
until

we
move
to
a
big

live
in
at

my
mother
and
father
didn
t
have
much
time
to
spare
for
play
with
me
so
i
could
explore
in
peace
one
of
the
most
interest
place
be
a
store
a
few
hundred
yard
from
home
agricultural
machinery
be
kept
there
ma
chine
for
thresh
corn
for
shred

for
plough
field
and
for
mow
meadow
they
be
all
brand
new
positively
gleam
i
found
them
truly
enthral
they
have
red
paint
metal
part
and
bright
yellow
wooden
board
pro
tecting
the
heart
of
the
machine
where
there
be
motor
blade
belt
and
axle
everything
that
excite
me

against
all
odds
together
with
my
friend
heikki
sillanp
i
found
one
especially
fasci
nating
machine
heikki
grabbed
the
handle
on
the
other
side
be
a
hole
through
which
i
could
see
the
blade
as
sharp
as
knife
shred
straw
for
the
barn
the
machine
be
new
and
splendid
we
must
have
see
at
once
how
it
work
i
decide
to
look
at
the
mechanism
from
the
other
side
when
heikki
experiment
with
turn
the
handle
the
experiment
be
a
roar
success
i
thrust
my
hand
inside
the
ma
chine
and
heikki
turn
the
handle
the
blade
start
rotate
quite
fast
and
one
of
the
blade
cut
off
the
tip
of
my
finger
when
i
pull
my
hand
out
the
end
of
my
finger
hung
by
a
thread
of
skin
the
blood
spurt
all
over
the
place
and
i
ran
toward
home
the
safest
of
place
as
if
possess
the
pain
must
have
be
terrific
but
oddly
enough
i
don
t
remember
much
about
it
my
sister
leena
be
in
the
yard
and
when
she
saw
blood
spurt
from
my
finger
she
start
scream
her
cry
be
much
louder
than
mine
since
i
have
manage
to
control
myself
she
ran
upstairs
to
get
my
parent
while
i
follow
up
the
stair
bleeding
profusely
my
blood
left
permanent
trace
on
the
wall
of
the
stairway
somewhere
along
the
way
the
tip
of
my
finger
have
fall
off
and
couldn
t
be
found
even
though
my
parent
go
out
and
look
for
it
in
the
hospital
they
do
the
best
they
could
without
the
miss
bit
i
will
never
forget
that
summer
s
day
in
on
that
day
i
learn
that
while
the
world
may
feel
safe
it
be
in
fact
full
of
danger
even
curiosity
have
its
limit
if
you
want
to
hang
on
to

of
the

again
look
after
the

and
only
ever
receive
a

of

from

we
didn
t
waste

and
a
black

he
crack
a
joke
which

have
make
the

laugh
and
at
the

time
his
flash
go
off
everyone
sat
and
look
into
the
camera
and
many
do

remain
serious
in

look
unsure
of
myself
my

be
sunk
into

have
no
idea
then
what
my
future
might
hold
we
didn
t
discus
it
at
home
my
father
have
have
enough
of
electrical
installation
and
have
become
a
factory
manager
as
for
myself
i
have
make
just
one
deci
sion
and
i
intend
to
stick
to
it
there
be
no
way
i
be
go
into
indus
try
factory
and
workshop
seem
dirty
and
the
work
be
monotonous
what
be
more
my
father
be
at
work
every
single
day
i
doubt
whether
i
want
such
a
tough
career
my
father
never
have
enough
time
for
me
and
everyone
else
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
the
whole
time
too
day
be
full
of
work
and
bustle
everyone
be
on
a
journey
somewhere
onwards
or
upwards
no
one
have
time
for
frivolity
feeling
or
fret
we
have
a
new
home
on
account
of
my
father
s
new
job
a
large
and
light
wooden
house
next
to
the
factory
at
home
the
only
thing
expect
of
me
be
that
i
would
do
well
at
school
this
be
no
problem
besides
our
parent
have
somehow
make
me
believe
that
by
study
ing
work
and
research
one
could
meet
challenge
that
at
first
seem
impossible
by
preparation
and
careful
consideration
one
could
get
the
bet
ter
of
any
opponent
knowledge
be
power
by
which
one
could
transform
one
s
destiny
with
the
help
of
knowledge
one
could
advance
and
do
great
thing
with
knowl
edge
one
could
compete
and
never
be
limited
i
really
don
t
know
where
this
optimistic
view
of
the
world
come
from
perhaps
my
parent
be
draw
on
their
own
disappointment
to
moti
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
vate
their
child
they
have
both
be
compel
to
give
up
study
early
both
have
be
the
first
in
their
family
to
matriculate
from
high
school
but
neither
have
ever
graduate
from
university
they
really
want
their
own
child
to
have
a
chance
to
study
and
eventually
to
graduate
for
my
mother
the
decision
to
abandon
her
study
in
order
to
establish
a
family
have
be
a
painful
one
it
be
never
openly
discuss
because
it
would
have
hurt
my
mother
too
much
it
be
only
by
good
fortune
that
she
have
go
to
secondary
school
after
her
father
s
death
and
fought
for
a
place
at
university
but
she
have
never
have
the
chance
to
show
how
far
her
intel
lect
and
talent
would
have
take
her
i
assume
she
would
have
go
far
my
mother
be
bitter
about
her
fate
and
the
bitterness
gradually
change
to
a
sort
of
gray
cloud
that
everyone
notice
but
no
one
mention
that
cloud
act
as
a
silent
demand
that
her
child
study
and
take
the
opportunity
deny
to
her
my
mother
s
experience
come
to
mind
much
later
when
i
met
chinese
president
and
party
leader
jiang
zemin
in
my
mother
have
die
by
then
so
i
couldn
t
talk
to
her
about
my
conversation
with
jiang
the
dis
tinguished
chairman
and
president
want
to
know
what
i
thought
about
set
up
a
stock
exchange
in
china
my
view
be
that
the
chinese
could
indeed
set
up
a
stock
exchange
but
the
most
important
thing
be
to
take
care
of
education
the
country
need
good
engineer
lawyer
and
indus
trialists
in
order
to
remain
competitive
when
later
in
the
business
world
i
encounter
situation
that
seem
impossible
i
go
back
to
the
lesson
learn
at
home
everything
be
po
sible
if
only
you
research
study
and
do
thing
right
nokia
be
full
of
people
who
thought
the
same
way
as
me
we
couldn
t
accept
that
anything
be
impossible
everything
be
possible
for
those
who
know
what
they
re
do
but
without
thorough
knowledge
educate
hu
mility
and
close
attentiveness
nothing
good
will
come
i
have
never
be
terribly
good
at
improvise
i
have
always
want
to
prepare
for
everything
both
the
expect
and
the
unexpected
i
be
at
my
best
when
i
know
i
be
well
prepared
whether
the
matter
in
question
be
a
speech
a
deal
or
even
a
routine
meeting
of
course
i
still
knew
nothing
of
this
in
vaasa
high
school
at
the
begin
ning
of
the
s
there
i
sat
in
class
with
the
other
boy
sometimes
the
teacher
be
boring
and
narrow
sometimes
they
set
my
thought
race
for
example
raimo
teppo
s
history
and
social
study
lesson
be
spell
binding
so
that
every
boy
listen
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
teppo
take
a
keen
interest
in
the
economy
and
in
society
and
he
transmit
his
enthusiasm

against
all
odds
to
his
pupil
once
we
debate
which
of
finland
s
bank
be
best
it
be
from
him
that
i
learn
what
a
stock
exchange
be
and
why
the
value
of
share
fluctuates
i
be
not
the
sort
of
boy
who
would
have
be
vote
form
captain
i
didn
t
tell
anecdote
or
joke
i
didn
t
organize
party
and
i
didn
t
experiment
with
alcohol
or
tobacco
girl
like
me
but
i
wasn
t
a
heartthrob
who
receive
a
constant
stream
of
secret
love
letter
during
boring
lesson
i
have
be
taught
to
behave
well
at
home
it
be
emphasize
that
everyone
be
equal
and
we
should
all
have
the
chance
to
develop
our
talent
no
one
should
need
to
look
up
to
other
people
nor
should
anyone
be
allow
to
look
down
i
be
in
school
to
learn
not
to
enjoy
myself
many
of
my
classmate
en
joyed
themselves
at
our
teacher
expense
some
of
them
be
fun
to
tease
our
scripture
teacher
be
so
absent
mind
that
he
could
never
remember
where
he
have
left
his
car
sometimes
he
even
forgot
which
day
it
be
some
teacher
would
find
wet
mushroom
or
sharp
tack
on
their
chair
i
didn
t
take
part
in
these
activity
and
i
m
sure
many
of
the
other
boy
thought
i
be
a
bit
of
a
prig
i
certainly
seem
more
mature
than
most
perhaps
today
i
d
be
call
a
geek
n
rtti
in
finnish
in
those
day
i
often
use
to
cycle
to
play
tennis
in
the
evening
in
the
winter
it
might
well
be
twenty
degree
below
zero
i
take
my
tennis
racket
put
on
a
thick
winter
jacket
and
a
woolly
hat
and
rode
along
vaasa

dark
and
slippery
street
to
the
other
side
of
town
the
front
wheel
never
seem
to
keep
straight
and
cycling
be
rather
like

i
would
play
for
hour
with
my
friend
in
the
tennis
hall
if
i
lose
i
would
go
home
quiet
and
de
jected
tennis
have
become
a
serious
contest
like
so
many
other
thing
but
above
all
i
compete
with
myself
and
in
myself
i
encounter
a
tough
op
ponent
besides
tennis
my
recreation
be
the
scout
and
a
nature
club

that
time

twelve
and
later
i
become
the
chairman
of
the

focus
on
ornithology
because
we
lay
under
one
of
the
major
avian
migration
route
for
many
a
nature

the
spark
for
a
career
as
a
biologist
or

photographer
through
the
club
i
also
get
to
read
some
fascinate
book
such
as
rachel
carson

silent
spring
the
book
s
title
refers

solemn
though
even
if
it
be

at
time
we
didn
t
broadcast
our
emotion
either
joyful
or

in
particular
value

in

under

from

we
have
watch

to
acquire
this
new
and
revolutionary
device

to
destroy
child

chanc
e
of

at

and
to

get
a
television
in
my
schoolmate
have
convince
me
of
its
advantage

it
would
be

by
ten
at
the
late

which
my

could
watch
in
the
middle
of
the

for
example
if

boxing
match
with
cassius
clay

do
change
the

we
don

only
in

my

be
precisely
such
an
event

against
all
odds
atlantic

be
establish
to
bring
together
student
from

be
chosen
on
the
basis
of

to
see
how
well
they
would
fit
in
this
year
two
of
us
from

would
go
a

from

cost
you

also
reach
the

by
a
different
route
rich

but
their

e
verything
come
to
an
end
my
escape

in
the
spring
of
i
graduate
from

with
excellent
mark
in
both
the
international

in

finland
as
do
the
other
finn
the
finnish
cultural
foundation
which
have
fund
our
study
expect
that
of
us
i
suppose
though
that
we
would
have
all
return
home
anyway
because
a
peculiar
emotion
have
developed
within
us
it
would
perhaps
be
too
solemn
to
call
it
patriotism
while
homesickness
sound
a
little
too
frivolous
it
be
some
thing
between
the
two
for
which
there
isn
t
really
a
word
in
either
finnish
or
english
we
have
have
to
represent
finland
which
be
scarcely
know
at
all
in
the
rest
of
the

now
we
want
to
come
back

or
indeed
give
me
any
credit
for
them
the

assume
that
a
student
with
an
international
background
would
sit
its

and
so
confirm
that
they
would

of

a
week
after
i
d
finish
my

in

i
once
again
found
myself
in

it
be
tedious
anyone
who
have
ever
take
en
trance
exam
for

will
know
how
important
it
be
to
prepare
properly
and
i

always
believe
in
prepare
myself
thoroughly
for
everything

do
now
i
be
sit

a

along

apart
from

from

it
be
my
first

in
a
long
time
with
my
finnish
contemporary
they
be
hunch
over
their

paper
their

flop
over
their

physic
fortunately
the
ground
i
d
receive
at
atlantic

be
so
thorough
that
i
knew
as
soon
as
it
be
over
that
i
d
do
well
i
felt
at
ease
with
the

i
d
be
able
to
respond

especially
among
student
in

the

turn
into
a

form
of

that
blindly
idealize
the
soviet

in
the

this
strange

influential
indeed
almost
hegemonic
in

the

of

be
a
very
different
sort
of
boy
from
the
one
who
have
left
for
atlantic
college
nearly
two
year
before
i
have
certainly
grown
a
little
taller
i
be
gangly
long
haired
and
fully
familiar
with
the
late
pop
music
from
britain
and
the
state
in
the
spirit
of
the
age
i
wore
trendy
jean
and
my
english
be
fluent
though
apart
from
finnish
and
english
i
didn
t
really
know
any
other
language
i
be
still
work
to
fill
this
gap
when
i
be
at
nokia
but
the
most
important
thing
be
that
i
have
grown
in
self
confidence
and
self
esteem
i
have
go
abroad
for
two
year
on
my
first
foreign
trip
i
have
survive
indeed
flourish
though
from
time
to
time
i
have
miss
finland
and
my
family

against
all
odds
now
however
i
be
back
home
where
i
spent
the
summer
help
with
the
hay
on
my
uncle
s
farm
at
the
end
of
the
sixty
the
region
be
prosperous
and
lively
although
the
farm
be
small
and
old
fashion
and
relative
be
the
main
source
of
power
just
a
little
while
back
at
atlantic
college
i
d
be
work
with
pen
and
slide
rule
now
i
be
hold
a

or
a

that
summer
be
the
last
extend
period
i
would
spend
in
ostrobothnia
though
i
didn
t
know
that
as
i
slog
away
in
the
field
i
felt
neither
sad
nor
nostalgic
rather
i
have
a
sense
of
excitement
and
expectation
when
neil
armstrong
and
apollo
be
approach
the

and
armstrong
take
the

from
my

make
me
independent
of
my
parent
and
cut
me
free
from
the
place
where
i
grow
up
my
world
be
open
my
parent
be
no
longer
much
in
my
thought
and
i
certainly
didn
t
listen
to
them
as
i
have
when
i
be
young
the
self
sufficient
child
have
grown
into
an
indepen
dent
young
man
in
a
single
bound
it
have
be
stressful
but
it
have
also
be
necessary
while
many
of
my
generation
interested
themselves
in
soviet
collective
farm
the
communist
party
and
five
year
plan
i
have
move
west
to
join
the
wider
european
and
global
conversation
at
a
key
phase
of
intellectual
development
my
world
view
have
diverge
from
many
of
my
contempo
raries
i
have
study
and
also
see
how
the
world
work
how
capital
ism
work
at
the
same
time
that
many
of
my
friend
have
cleanse
their
mind
of
independent
think
in
favor
of
party
propaganda
i
have
pain
fully
learn
to
think
for
myself
to
put
together
my
own
viewpoint
and
to
defend
them
against
intelligent
criticism
this
experience
built
up
my
self
esteem
but
it
also
make
me
an
outsider
in
finland
where
activist
in
political
party
seem
to
be
gain
the
upper
hand
and
take
ever
more
important

ever
young
age
leftism
the
adoration
of
the
soviet
union
and
the
german
democratic
republic
have
assume
the
nature
of
a
group
psychosis
in
finland
the

reach
its
peak
in
when

i
didn
t
have
a
dream
profession
but
i
have
a
hunch
i
d
find
a
niche
in
academia
i
thought
i
might
perhaps
be
a
good
professor
of
physic
at
a
university
or
polytechnic
i
thought
too
that
i
might
continue
my
civic
ac
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
tivities
which
i
have
begin
in
the
inspire
environment
of
atlantic
college
as
a
nineteen
year
old
i
found
myself
analyze
the
finnish
government
s
economic
policy
use
the
broad
experience
i
have
gain
from
atlantic
college
s
economics
course
and
from
reading
the
economist
every
week
perhaps
a
professor
of
physic
could
benefit
from
these
activity
to
some
extent
and
weren
t
physic
and
economics
all
about
calculation
and
mathe
matics
which
just
get
easy
and
easy
for
me
that
be
my
train
of
thought
as
i
make
hay
on
holiday
that
summer
in
august
the
post
brought
the
sort
of
letter
finnish
family
long
for
i
have
be
accepted
to
read
apply
physic
at
helsinki
university
of
technol
ogy
i
go
with
my
father
to
the
bank
in
vaasa
where
i
d
have
an
account
since
childhood
to
apply
for
a
student
loan
this
be
before
the
state
au
tomatically
guaranteed
such
loan
so
there
we
be
in
our
suit
and
care
fully
iron
shirt
my
father
guaranteed
the
loan
and
the
follow
day
i
receive
the
soothe
news
that
the
loan
have
be
approve
my
university
year
could
begin

against

the
brown
decade
they
begin
for
me
on
september
when
i
enrol
at
the

i
go
to
live
in

in
a

which
have
be
built
to

at
the
time
of
the
helsinki

it
can
t
have
change
much
since
then
the
dominant
color
be
brown
and
dark
blue
during
my
first
year
i
share
my
bedroom
with
another
first
year
student
in
the
tradition
of
student
banter
one
could
say
he
hasn
t
get
very
far
since
matti
juhala
be
now
professor
of
vehicle
technology
at
helsinki
university
of
technology
we
each
have
a
narrow
bed
a
desk
a
chair
and
a
wardrobe
there
be
a
basin
in
the
corner
for
us
to
brush
our
teeth
and
wash
our

and
a
communal
area
with
a
bathroom

in
my

year
i
have
a
room
to
myself
in
the
same
block
helsinki
university
of

be
an
almost
instinctive
choice
for
me
there
have
always
be
lot
of
engineer
in
my
family
and
after
me
many
an
ollila
have
study
to
become
a
charter
engineer
for
my
major
i
chose
apply
physic
one
of
the
more
demand
and
theoretical
course
on
offer
i
like
the
challenge
and
hop
the
bar
would
be
high
enough
my
fellow
student
be
clever
and
have
demonstrate
as
much
in
their
exam
they
come
from
all
over
finland
though
the
helsinki
region
be
the
most
strongly
represent
since
that

where
the

who

our
apartment
come
from
every
year
of
the
course
we
make
a
good
group
and
our
communal
life
be
very
agreeable
rather
than
barricade
ourselves
into
our
own
room
we
spent
our
free
time
in
the
living
area
make
coffee
and
discuss
current
event
the
two
and
a
half
year
i
spent
in
this
group
be
one
of
the
best
thing
about
university
life
we
ve
often
gotten
together
since
engineering
student
sometimes
talk
these
day
of
become
otaniemi
fied
this
be
a
particular
way
of
become
institutionalize
of
rarely
leav
ing
otaniemi
it
never
happen
to
me
i
use
to
play
tennis
in
downtown
helsinki
i
didn
t
often
join
in
with
the
organize
activity
of
the
other
stu
dent
though
i
lead
an
active
life
so
active
in
fact
that
even
tennis
become
a
seasonal
sport
this
be
the
only
time
in
my
life
i
have
take
break
from
this
important
pursuit
i
met
my
first
stalinist
at
otaniemi
they
held
strong
opinion
the
problem
for
the
social
democrat
the
centre
party
and
the
conservative
be
that
they
don
t
have
a
society
to
model
themselves
on
a
pattern
for
living
that
would
work
all
over
the
world
well
than
finland
we
on
the
other
hand
have
both
the
gdr
and
the
soviet
union
they
would
say
from
today
s
point
of
view
it
s
difficult
to
appreciate
just
how
over
politi
cized
the
seventy
be
everything
and
i
mean
everything
be
political
i
begin
my
political
career
as
a
candidate
in
student
election
which
in
have
be
openly
party
political
for
the
first
time
i
chose
to
stand
as
a
con
servative
where
i
come
from
we
have
a
two
party
system
and
everyone
i
knew
vote
either
for
the
conservative
or
for
the
centre
party
i
imagine
the
conservative
would
be
the
choice
of
the
think
person
whom
social
ism
didn
t
attract
in
the
way
it
didn
t
attract
me
it
rapidly
become
clear
to
me
that
conservative
policy
in
these
election
consist
entirely
of
opposi
tion
to
socialism
and
have
no
other
content
a
positive
alternative
seem
to

against
all
odds
be
lack
the
party
s
policy
seem
entirely
negative
with
no
construc
tive
element
this
wasn
t
enough
for
me
after
the
first
year
i
move
to
the
centre
party
group
where
there
seem
to
be
people
who
could
think
just
as
i
grow
impatient
with
politics
so
i
begin
to
tire
of
a
wholly
techni
cal
education
i
have
no
cause
for
complaint
with
my
study
but
differential
equation
alone
didn
t
open
up
the
world
as
much
as
i
want
i
hanker
after
a
broader
education
with
a
great
focus
on
social
issue
i
have
study
economics
in
wale
and
i
want
to
continue
that
study
at
the
university
level
i
have
friend
in
the
political
science
department
at
helsinki
university
so
i
apply
and
be
accepted
there
in
this
time
i
didn
t
have
to
sit
the
entrance
exam
since
to
my
surprise
i
be
accepted
on
the
basis
of
my
result
from
atlantic
college
the
economics
department
be
in
central
helsinki
i
enjoy
it
immensely
the
atmosphere
be
agreeable
and
the
discussion
and
teach
provide
a
new
angle
of
entry
to
social
issue
the
department
have
some
smart
people
and
i
receive
excellent
guidance
from
them
on
what
i
should
study
study
be
not
very
sociable
however
i
didn
t
attend
a
single
series
of
lecture
and
just
a
few
seminar
for
the
most
part
i
have
my
nose
in
the
book
for
the
examine
course
make
up
for
lose
time
as
fast
as
i
could
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
chapter
liisa
change
my
life
o
ne
february
even
in
change
all
my
plan
once
more
i
be
with
my
friend
at
a
student
dance
and
so
be
a
young
woman
with
her
friend
from
the
helsinki
school
of
economics
i
be
queue
to
buy
a
beer
when
my
eye
fell
on
a
beautiful
blonde
and
clever
look
girl
she
seem
to
be
look
to
see
who
be
in
the
queue
i
learn
later
that
this
be
just
a
little
way
she
have
that
didn
t
really
mean
anything
anyway
when
i
d
bought
my
beer
i
ask
her
to
dance
i
use
my
power
of
attraction
to
the
full
and
later
we
left
together
to
continue
the
even
with
our
friend
back
at
the
residence
hall
there
i
ask
for
her
telephone
number
which
she
write
on
a
slip
of
paper
be
you
sure
this
number
be
right
i
ask
again
at
the
end
of
the
eve
ning
i
wouldn
t
give
you
a
number
if
it
wasn
t
the
right
one
she
reply
there
be
decisiveness
in
her
voice
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
invitation
too
i
rang
her
as
soon
as
i
could
i
thought
she
might
have
found
me
too
talkative
and
eager
my
stalk
brought
a
result
however
and
i
soon
met
her
again
the
girl
in
question
be
liisa
metsola
who
have
qualify
as
a
nurse
and
be
already
work
while
i
be

a
lot
of
time
together

go
to
the
cinema
to
the
theatre
to
concert
and
to
student
party
in
other
word
we
do
what
young
couple
do
liisa
come
from
a
family
with
root
in
eastern
finland
and
karelia
the
eastern
finn
be
much
well
at
show
and
act
on
their
emotion
than
we
western
finn
liisa
think
thing
through
for
herself
in
a
straightforward
way
and
isn
t
afraid
to
disagree
with
me

against
all
odds
the
first
summer
we
be
a
couple
we
have
to
spend
apart
since
i
have
to
go
back
once
more
to
vaasa
there
i
have
to
undertake
a
placement
in
an
en
gineering
workshop
as
part
of
my
degree
a
place
have
be
arrange
in
the
factory
where
my
father
work
where
i
do
maintenance
work
and
some
plumbing
job
the
atmosphere
be
very
different
from
what
i
be
use
to
at
atlantic
college
and
the
university
of
technology
but
i
get
on
fine
with
my
workmate
we
talk
men
s
talk
of
work
of
woman
of
football
vaasa
fc
be
then
play
in
the
top
division
as
i
m
proud
to
say
it
do
today
my
time
in
that
factory
taught
me
some
crucial
lesson
for
my
future
career
about
the
internal
dynamic
of
a
workplace
and
the
difference
between
good
and
bad
line
management
i
can
t
exaggerate
the
importance
of
one
s
early
work
experience
liisa
and
i
be
engage
on
the
may
day
holiday
in
i
approach
her
father
and
told
him
of
my
intention
to
marry
his
daughter
he
reply
positively
to
my
polite
request
although
she
and
i
disagreed
with
him
on
practically
everything
else
we
argue
about
politics
so
furiously
that
at
time
it
felt
like
a
family
feud
he
have
be
an
evacuee
from
karelia
when
the
soviet
union
have
invade
finland
in
and
his
family
home
have
be
raze
to
the
ground
his
hatred
for
the
russian
wasn
t
a
political
stance
but
something
much
deeper
he
be
out
of
sympathy
with
the
central
aim
of
the
finnish
government
which
be
to
achieve
friendly
relation
with
the
russian
through
an
active
foreign
policy
our
argument
be
repeat
in
many
finnish
family
where
memory
of
the
war
year
be
still
fresh
we
be
married
on
march
at
a
little
chapel
in
otaniemi

building
be
surround
by

about
forty

unique

its
altarpiece
there

t
one
its
place
be
take
by
the
finnish
forest
landscape
see
through
a
huge
window
take
up
the
entire
wall

wedding
be
take
place
in
a
wintry
forest

everybody

keep
up
my
parent

have
married
because
i
hadn

quick
student
affair

her
priority
and
i
would

find
a
time

keep
us
together
i

with
vary
success

on
this
basis
well
honestly
speak
i
can
t
say
it
be
always
easy

many
young

begin
their
married
life
as

at
that
time
the
talk
in
the
corridor
be
that
a
centrist
candidate
should
become
president
because
neither
a
conservative
nor
a
leftist
would
receive
broad
enough
support
the
night
before
the
ac
tual
election
be
key
because
the
crucial
politick
take
place
in
the
small
hour
the
search
be
on
for
a
centrist
candidate
for
president
who
would
be
acceptable
to
everyone
i
fit
the
bill
also
during
that
night
we
drew
up
an
outline
program
for
the
come
year
so
there
be
argument
about
that
as
well
it
be
like
draw
up
a
government
program
in
the
space
of
an
even
on
sunday
i
set
off
on
the
long
journey
home
know
my
life
be
about
to
undergo
a
major
change
i
have
be
elect
president
of
the
national
union
of

two
i
have
be
the
chairman
of
the
national
union
of
technology
student
so
i
have
some
idea
of
how
to
run
thing
i
have
for
example
help
organize
boycott
of
lecture
intend
to
encourage
the
modernize
of
university
governance
as
student
we
de
manded
that
we
should
be
directly
represent
on
the
govern
body
now
i
would
be
advance
student
interest
full
time
my
new
role
have
a
significant
international
angle
so
my
study
abroad
and
language
skill
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
certainly
help
when
i
be

the
first
time

figure
of
national
signifi
cance
my
parent
be
bemuse
they
didn
t
feel
this
new

half
a
year
into
our
marriage
liisa
have
to
adapt
to
the
fact
that
her

i
receive
a
small
salary
which
largely
go
on

as
in
any
job
my
study
be
on
hold
i
still
have
two

that
time
and
the

be
blank
no

i
wore
a
suit
and

and
travel
everything
be
in
earnest
and
over
politicize
i
take
myself
very
seriously
and
it
seem
as
if
i
be
age
very
fast
in
my
role
the
union
be
well
run
both
bureaucratically
and
financially
the
secretary
be
highly
profes
sional
and
kept
youthful
enthusiasm
in
check
whereas
the
executive
board
be
of
variable
ability
at
that
time
the
syl
be
see
as
a
natural
springboard
to
a
career
in
na
tional
politics
for
example
tarja
halonen
later
president
of
finland
have
be
on
the
board
only
a
couple
of
year
earlier
and
later
move
via
the
trade
union
movement
into
parliament
i
want
to
be
a
student
leader
and
i
enjoy
my
work
i
often
use
to
travel
to
university
around
the
country
i
be
constantly
in
meeting
with
senior
official
and
government
minister
but
i
never
actually
saw
myself
as
a
politician
rather
as
someone
whose
role
be
to
speak
up
for
student
i
enjoy
work
in
an
organization
with
a
small
group
of
people
i
want
ed
to
lead
it
effectively
meeting
should
have
an
agenda
objective
and
a
clear
timetable
i
wasn
t
interested
in
publicity
and
i
didn
t
seek
it
though
i
do
get
my
first
taste
of
it
which
come
in
handy
later
i
learn
to
make
speech
entirely
spontaneously
which
hadn
t
be
among
my
strong
point
i
also
learn
to
write
long
carefully
consider
speech
whose
official
line
correspond
with
finnish
foreign
policy
i
have
never
like
compromise
but
as
a
student
politician
i
have
to
make
them
every
day
a
tedious
but
also
educational
side
of
the
job
sometimes
my
impatience
rise
to
the
surface
even
on
a
good
day
run
ning
the
national
union
of
student
in
finland
be
a
constant
defensive

against
all
odds
operation
the
rise
of
the
communist
and
the
growth
of
their
power
have
to
be
stop
although
the
left
didn
t
have
a
majority
at
that
time
it
felt
as
if
there
be
a
real
danger
that
it
would
take
over
the
entire
student
world
in
many
european
country
student
body
have
become
radicalize
and
the
majority
of
student
be
alienate
from
them
that
be
what
happen
in
france
for
example
prevent
it
happen
in
finland
become
a
mission
for
the
centrist
group
in
finland
at
the
syl
as
the
representative
of
the
centrist
i
also
have
to
cooperate
with
the
con
servatives
though
many
issue
be
resolve
with
the
left
the
left
and
the
centre
form
the
so
call
pan
democratic
front
which
held
power
even
so
while
i
be
its
president
the
syl
never
sign
the
declaration
against
the
free
trade
agreement
with
the
european
economic
community
there
be
strident
demand
for
the
agreement
to
be
reject
people
who
would
later
hold
important
position
such
as
tarja
halonen
later
president
of
fin
land
erkki
tuomioja
later
foreign
minister
and
erkki
liikanen
gover
nor
of
the
bank
of
finland
all
actively
oppose
it
in
important
question
of
foreign
policy
where
relation
with
the
west
be
at
stake
the
syl
stayed
firmly
behind
agree
national
policy
i
learn
the
rule
of
the
political
game
i
have
be
the
agree
choice
of
the
centrist
and
the
left
for
my
role
in
some
issue
after
careful
delibera
tion
i
vote
with
the
conservative
to
promote
what
i
believe
be
sen
sible
policy
this
irritated
the
left
and
some
centrist
too
and
give
rise
to
accusation
that
i
be
an
opportunist
and
a
turncoat
learn
politics
from
the
inside
be
an
enormous
help
later
on
lead
a
student
organization
in
finland
in
the
s
certainly
taught
me
what
poli
tic
discussion
rhetoric
horse
trading
and
opportunism
be
a
ceo
have
to
understand
what
politics
be
all
about
otherwise
the
company
will
start
to
misinterpret
its
environment
which
be
the
society
it
operates
in
the
conse
quences
could
be
fatal
to
the
company
because
you
usually
can
t
change
your
environment
you
have
to
adapt
to
it
instead
the
main
reason
the
president
s
job
be
energy
sap
be
the
stalinist
they
be
self
assure
and
knew
what
they
want
others
pile
in
behind
them
they
follow
a
twin
track
policy
on
the
one
hand
they
take
the
par
liamentary
route
actively
and
aggressively
exploit
the
syl
s
position
and
resource
on
the
other
hand
they
be
try
to
bring
about
a
revolution
this
pincer
movement
be
very
hard
to
fend
off
relation
with
the
soviet
union
be
ruthlessly
exploit
as
a
pretext
for
change
at
home
my
own
attitude
take
their
support
as
its
start
point
when
a
group
have
about
percent
support
an
organization
like
the
syl
have
in
fairness
to
give
it
a
hearing
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
it
s
good
to
remember
that
the
stalinist
movement
receive
more
attention
than
its
level
of
support
merit
in
parliamentary
election
it
receive
only
a
few
percent
of
the
vote
though
the
figure
be
high
in
student
election
finland
be
lead
by
urho
kekkonen
who
have
be
in
office
since
he
be
the
chief
architect
of
the
country
s
foreign
policy
and
the
guarantor
of
finnish
independence
vi
vi
the
soviet
union
the
popularity
of
his
policy
be
grow
in
the
early
seventy
both
among
the
electorate
and
in
political
circle
it
be
largely
thanks
to
kek
konen
that
finland
have
be
able
to
negotiate
a
free
trade
agreement
with
the
eec
this
be
important
for
finnish
export
industry
in
january
kekkonen
s
term
of
office
due
to
expire
in
have
be
extend
by
an
exceptional
act
of
parliament
to
run
until
this
be
no
foregone
con
clusion
since
it
require
five
sixth
of
the
member
of
parliament
to
vote
for
it
it
be
intimately
link
with
the
eec
agreement
and
new
law
ex
tend
the
state
s
regulatory
power
which
the
left
in
particular
support
kekkonen
and
finnish
foreign
policy
also
enjoy
respect
in
the
west
finnish
neutrality
be
widely
recognize
but
many
western
politician
and
journalist
never
fully
understood
just
what
a
tightrope
finland
have
to
walk
during
the
cold
war
the
president
have
bitter
enemy
back
home
as
well
who
publicly
accuse
him
of
kowtow
to
soviet
wish
and
thus
of
fin
landization
i
met
kekkonen
a
number
of
time
most
of
these
meeting
be
formal
occasion
but
i
also
go
to
his
official
residence
to
discus
issue
such
as
the
reshape
of
university
governance
we
explain
the
syl
s
standpoint
to
him
kekkonen
s
position
in
finland
be
so
dominant
that
people
in
volved
him
in
issue
that
weren
t
really
his
responsibility
he
be
vigilant
and
engage
and
concerned
above
all
with
power
politics
how
do
the
par
tie
divide
over
the
issue
how
do
politician
public
statement
reflect
their
personal
goal
these
be
some
of
the
question
he
put
to
me
during
our
discussion
my
most
memorable
meeting
with
him
be
at
the
independence
day
re
ception
in
december
it
be
the
custom
for
the
student
union
to
present
its
greeting
to
the
president
before
the
main
event
i
have
prepared
a
few
word
request
the
president
to
focus
attention
on
the
serious
short
age
of
student
housing
as
i
walk
toward
the
presidential
palace
it
felt
as
if
the
damp
helsinki
street
be
soak
up
all
the
light
despite
the
christ
ma
decoration
in
the
shop
window
we
met
the
president
at
half
past
six
half
an
hour
before
the
official
re
ception
start
and
a
stream
of
guest
would
flow
into
the
state
room
our

against
all
odds
liisa
and
i
at
the
independence
day
reception
in
with
finland
s
finance
minister
johannes
virolainen
and
his
wife
kaarina
meeting
be
naturally
a
terrify
prospect
first
there
be
the
age
differ
ence
kekkonen
be
fifty
year
old
than
me
a
very
fit
seventy
three
and
he
didn
t
show
any
sign
of
the
dementia
that
would
afflict
him
a
few
year
later
secondly
there
be
kekkonen
s
unassailable
position
which
young
generation
find
impossible
to
understand
he
have
be
president
since
i
be
five
and
would
carry
on
until
i
be
thirty
one
it
be
almost
unthink
able
that
anyone
else
could
be
president
we
be
a
small
delegation
who
arrive
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
and
be
direct
inside
the
others
in
the
spirit
of
the
age
be
wear
lounge
suit
but
i
be
correctly
attire
in
full
even
dress
frankly
it
wasn
t
all
that
comfortable
the
wall
be
hung
with
fine
art
depict
finnish
forest
and
wildlife
and
historical
battle
though
this
wasn
t
the
moment
to
embark
on
a
course
in
art
history
we
enter
the
room
self
importantly
and
in
line
with
protocol
the
pres
ident
stood
wait
for
us
with
an
array
of
decoration
pin
to
his
chest
finland
perhaps
surprisingly
to
some
have
a
flourish
honor
system
he
look
at
us
fiercely
through
his
large
intimidate
spectacle
he
have
an
adjutant
on
either
side
as
one
president
to
another
it
be
my
duty
to
of
fer
him
our
salutation
mr
president
of
the
republic
happy
independence
day
i
begin
we
also
offer
him
a
little
bouquet
of
lily
for
his
wife
sylvi
the
president
accepted
the
flower
and
i
thought
i
saw
the
ghost
of
a
smile
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
thank
you
i
shall
make
sure
immediately
that
these
reach
their
intend
destination
he
reply
it
broke
the
ice
after
that
i
make
my
little
speech
as
the
syl
president
i
have
also
be
invite
to
the
real
reception
so
after
our
brief
meeting
one
of

in
the
soviet

as
president
i
travel
many
time
to
moscow
and
to
prague
where
the
headquarters
of
the
communist
student
organiza
tions
be
locate
i
learn
how
to
operate
within
the
confines
of

foreign
policy
and
that
international
meeting
have
their
own
special
usage
and
ritual
home
grown
communist
often
come
along
on
these
excursion
i
re
member
one
occasion
when
we
be
travel
by
train
behind
the
iron
curtain
the
conductor
kept
a
visitor
book
where
traveler
inscribed
their
name
and
a
few
fraternal
word
a
select
group
of
stalinist
left
this
me
sage
my
homeland
be
finland
but
my
fatherland
be
the
soviet
union
i
have
visit
moscow
for
the
first
time
in
when
we
concentrate
chiefly
on
investigate
the
quality
of
soviet
beer
which
seem
well
up
to
standard
otherwise
i
found
nothing
to
celebrate
in
the
soviet
union
be
cause
the
gap
between
its
super
power
status
and
its
level
of
technological
development
be
clear
but
the
russian
student
politician
we
met
radiate
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
intelligence
and
talk
readily
about
international
affair
it
be
easy
to
dis
cuss
the
dollar
exchange
rate
the
oil
crisis
or
u
s
economic
policy
but
de
spite
these
conversation
the
russian
remain
product
of
the
communist
system
they
be
always
aware
of
the
party
line
and
no
one
could
officially
cross
it
but
in
the
small
hour
after
a
few
vodka
they
might
say
what
they
thought
sadly
genuine
friendship
be
not
possible
because
everyone
be
stuck
with
a
role
several
of
the
russian
later
found
a
place
in
the
gor
bachev
yeltsin
and
putin
government
the
level
of
education
in
the
soviet
union
be
high
student
politician
knew
mathematics
economics
and
international
relation
but
when
for
example
i
go
on
a
guide
tour
of
the
collective
farm
in
moldova
then
part
of
the
soviet
union
i
saw
how
the
country
s
logistics
let
it
down
a
crop
of
peach
be
left
to
rot
when
it
should
have
be
sell
in
moscow
their
own
effort
do
not
make
people
richer
and
there
be
no
incentive
for
work
time
after
time
i
return
from
the
soviet
union
with
a
feel
of
relief
this
economic
system
could
never
beat
a
market
economy
the
market
economy
however
have
problem
of
its
own
just
like
com
munism
it
contain
the
seed
of
its
own
destruction
in
practice
mac
roeconomics
i
have
learn
to
see
an
economy
as
a
system
that
move
from
disequilibrium
to
equilibrium
and
back
again
at
the
begin
of
the
s
it
be
shift
rapidly
toward
disequilibrium
at
the
end
of
the
oil
produce
country
decide
to
press
the
western
world
to
change
its
policy
toward
israel
the
oil
price
go
up
by
percent
some
oil
shipment
be
sell
for
ten
time
or
more
than
what
they
d
have
fetch
a
year
before
the
world
economy
be
suddenly
hostage
to
the
oil
producer
and
international
recession
be
a
fact
the
world
recover
from
the
oil
crisis
but
it
left
an
endure
mark
on
economic
think
a
debate
start
about
energy
conservation
and
alter
native
energy
source
which
be
still
very
much
with
us
today
the
middle
east
and
opec
become
a
permanent
part
of
the
political
agenda
our
whole
world
change
in
spring
even
before
the
energy
crisis
a
group
of
ex
perts
and
futurist
work
at
the
club
of
rome
have
publish
a
book
call
the
limit
to
growth
which
warn
that
the
world
s
resource
could
no
lon
ger
sustain
constant
economic
growth
thus
the
world
s
economy
have
to
change
growth
have
reach
its
limit
now
the
club
of
rome
be
propose
that
zero
growth
should
be
the
target
so
that
the
world
with
all
its
natural
rich
could
survive
when
the
oil
crisis
burst
upon
us
the
warning
give
by
the
club
of
rome
be
take
seriously
they
become
the
theoretical
base
for
the
policy
of
those
political
group
such
as
my
own
that
occupy
the

against
all
odds
center
ground
between
the
hard
left
and
the
dogmatic
right
while
these
political
group
support
capitalism
and
the
market
economy
they
also
want
economic
development
to
respect
the
constraint
impose
by
nature
and
natural
resource
i
read
the
club
of
rome
report
closely
i
have
after
all
be
a
member
of
a
nature
club
at
school
i
be
also
a
student
of
macroeconomics
and
i
un
derstood
a
little
about
politics
on
top
of
that
technological
development
interested
me
even
then
i
try
to
understand
the
logic
of
the
club
of
rome
but
i
couldn
t
believe
that
they
be
right
to
my
mind
zero
growth
be
a
superficial
target
a
figure
plucked
out
of
nowhere
i
have
learn
in
eco
nomics
lecture
that
economic
growth
be
necessary
for
human
well
be
in
a
grow
population
i
haven
t
waver
in
this
belief
since
the
club
of
rome
didn
t
take
into
account
technological
development
which
enable
the
same
output
to
be
produce
use
less
energy
and
few
national
resource
with
hindsight
the
club
of
rome
report
be
far
too
pessimistic
about
technology
the
report
warn
that
copper
or
silver
might
run
out
by
but
nothing
will
ever
run
out
in
a
properly
function
market
economy
for
example
if
there
be
a
risk
that
paper
might
disappear
new
alterna
tives
would
become
available
because
paper
would
become
unaffordable
the
world
s
know
oil
reserve
be
much
great
now
than
at
the
begin
of
the
s
and
oil
can
be
extract
in
much
more
difficult
condition
than
it
could
then
the
club
of
rome
thought
in
the
s
that
the
market
economy
have
an
innate
tendency
to
run
out
of
control
but
the
global
economy
have
show
itself
much
more
flexible
than
anyone
dare
imagine
no
one
believe
in
the
seventy
that
the
world
could
adapt
to
oil
crisis
the
crisis
of
and
produce
a
global
recession
but
they
also
give
impetus
to
the
technological
development
that
have
see
us
through
car
be
now
much
more
environmentally
friendly
and
more
nuclear
power
have
come
online
thus
the
world
gain
at
least
thirty
year
of
extra
time
none
of
this
would
have
happen
without
the
oil
crisis
or
the
club
of
rome
s
warning
they
ask
the
right
question
even
if
they
couldn
t
offer
answer
in
the
s
many
young
and
even
old
politician
would
meet
soviet
representative
and
visit
the
soviet
embassy
more
often
than
they
go
to
their
corner
shop
i
go
there
chiefly
for
set
piece
reception
my
contact
with
official
be
few
and
formal
as
a
counter
balance
to
the
russian
it
be
important
to
look
westward
as
well
in
may
i
travel
to
the

for
the
first

how

compare

seventy
finland
let
alone
the

struck
by
the
sheer
prosperity
there
be
as
much
coca

as
you
could

in

be
a
solid
introduction
to
america
in
washington
we
visit
congress
where
we
be
give
an
explanation
of
the
american
political
system
though
there
be
really
only
one
theme
to
the
discussion
what
would
happen
to
the
hapless
richard
nixon
during
our
visit
the
watergate
scandal

through
one
of
its
most
hectic
phase

divide

down
the

the

claimed
that
the
washington
post
didn
t
have
the
right
to
humiliate
nixon
as
they
have
while

now
on

by
no

as
politically
polarize
as
it
have
since

we
have
lively
discussion
of
what
be
healthy
about
the
whole
affair
and
what
wasn
t
the
trip
to
the

and
the
watergate

be
an
excellent
opportunity

the
american
sincere
belief
that
they
rule
the

many
people
in

where
social

these
recommendation
to

the

who
happen
to
be
an
acquaintance
we
promise
to
scrape
together
a
deposit
the
rest
we
would
borrow
from
the

my

which
be
the
only
loan

we
also
agree
to
use
our
student

to
increase
our
share
of
the
capital
the
housing
market

a
growth
spurt

in

want
to
own
our
own
home
liisa
and
i
be
reckless
as
be
many
others
and
we
believe
we
would
manage
the
oil
crisis
help
us
the
finnish
economy
have
slip
into
such
a
deep
bog
that
rampant
inflation
seem
to
pay
off
our
loan
for
us
very
quickly
for
once
macroeconomic
theory
be
a
practical
help
in
our
life
we
have
take
on
the
loan
at
just
the
right
time
i
have
go
back
to
study
macroeconomics
i
write
my
master
s
thesis
chiefly
in
the
faculty
library
i
often
found
myself
alongside
another
student
politician
who
have
put
his
study
aside
for
a
while
erkki
liikanen
who
be
my
age
but
have
be
a
member
of
parliament
since
when

put
the

to
right
i

my

entitle
the

and
i
receive
a
prize
for
the
best
ma
ter
s
thesis
in
macroeconomics
that
year
i
couldn
t
have
know
that
decade
on
i
would
be
work
on
the
very
same
subject
in
a
very
practical
way
it
s
probably
fair
to
say
that
erkki
liikanen
s
current
work
also
have
a
mac
roeconomic
theme
give
that
he
be

of
finland
and
a
member
of
the
board
of
the
european
central
bank

even
more
significant
than
my

be
the
birth
of
our
first
child

have
to
take
care
to
respect
the

though
i
do
not
finally
do

i
still
hadn
t
the
faintest
idea
what
i
would
do
i
have
the
bright
idea
that
i
should
stand
for

wasn
t

i
d
get
enough
vote
to
be

i
ve
never

would
have
hat
the
electioneer
and
hand
shake
the
foreign
ministry
might
have
be
an
interest
alternative
but
the
life
of
a
civil
servant
seem
a
little
slow
for
my
restless
nature
i
have
to
come
up
with
something
though
i
be
the
twenty
six
year
old

of
a

great
deal
of

no

i

at

be
bother

the

ineffectuality
like
many
other
finn
i
fear
for
my
country
s
future
i
saw
that
finland
have
to
find
a
way
of
move
closer
to
western
europe
there
be
no
alternative
for
the
finnish
economy
if
it
be
ever
to
thrive
i
believe
that
western
democracy
and
capitalism
be
prac
tically
and
morally
superior
to
socialist
economics
and
communist
politics
but
i
want
to
know
more
about
economics
i
want
to
learn
so
that
my
think
would
be
more
firmly
ground
and
more
convincing
and
helsinki
be
a
dull
gray
town
din
out
be
grim
with
no
ethnic
food
apart
from
chinese
or
perhaps
i
should
say
chinese
it
be
as
hard
to
find
a
decent
bottle
of
wine
in
alko
which
have
a
monopoly
on
the
sale
of
alcohol
as
to
find
an
authentic
sauna
in
tuscany
the
range
of
clothing
in
the
department
store
be
very
limited
and
the
fabric
and
design
be
old
fashion
the
best
hotel
would
have
rat
perhaps
three
star
there
wasn
t
a
shred
of
optimism
and
everything
be
regulate
it
seem
as
if
the
state
or
the
local
council
make
all
your
decision
for
you
in
the
autumn
of
i
begin
to
consider
new
option
at
the
start
of
i
saw
in
a
newspaper
that
the
british
council
be
offering
stipend
for
study
in
the
united
kingdom
it
be
practically
a
rerun
of
the
event
that
have
take
me
to
atlantic
college
exactly
ten
year
earlier
liisa
and
i
sat
at
the
kitchen
table
in
our
little
flat
and
talk
thing
through
stay
in
finland
might
not
be
the
smart
thing
to
do
we
plan
how
liisa
might
continue
her
own
study
in
london
i
decide
after
a
few
second
careful
consideration
that
my
new
place
of
study
should
be
the
london
school
of
economics
it
be
a
well
know
and
highly
regard
university
that
train
economist
social
scientist
and
philosopher
and
rock
star
mick
jag
ger
be
also
a
graduate
i
thought
it
might
suit
me
well
too
i
apply
for
a
grant
for
postgraduate
study
at
the
lse
and
to
undertake
a
doctorate
i
be
invite
to
interview
and
i
get
the
grant
by
april
i
have
the
funding
for
my
new
escape
my
decision
cause
astonishment
and
even
amusement
at
that
time
many
people
abandon
their
study
halfway
through
and
become
journal
ists
politician
or
activist
i
have
already
graduate
and
yet
i
have
decide
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
to
continue
my
study
and
many
people
found
this
absurd
also
it
be
unusual
then
to
study
abroad
those
who
do
go
mostly
to
neighbor
sweden
or
to
the
united
state
and
many
leftist
want
to
reinforce
their
faith
in
the
achievement
of
scientific
communism
by
study
in
moscow
the
german
democratic
republic
or
even
warsaw
i
told
my
colleague
in
the
centre
party
office
that
i
d
be
leave
i
sat
in
a
nearby
caf
where
i
be
join
by
two
of
my
colleague
we
order
pea
soup
for
lunch
now
as
we
discuss
earlier
this
be
a
temporary
job
for
me
i
begin
at
the
end
of
the
summer
i
ll
be
go
to
london
to
study
i
ve
get
a
grant
to
complete
a
doctorate
my
colleague
soup
remain
untouched
one
of
them
might
have
drop
a
spoon
so
you
re
really
go
for
a
long
time
and
give
up
politics
for
good
yes
i
be
i
m
really
not
sure
what
i
ll
do
in
the
long
run
but
for
the
moment
i
m
focus
on
an
academic
career
i
reply
by
august
we
be
back
in
london
the
choice
of
london
be
partly
a
matter
of
chance
and
partly
a
matter
of
careful
deliberation
as
a
former
pupil
at
atlantic
college
i
love
british
culture
the
way
of
think
and
liv
ing
i
have
gotten
to
know
how
british
school
work
and
i
knew
i
would
adapt
well
to
a
british
university
the
other
option
would
have
be
the
united
state
because
english
be
the
only
language
i
really
knew
apart
from
finnish
but
that
would
have
be
much
more
expensive
it
also
seem
to
me
that
the
lse
be
well
suit
to
my
perfectionist
streak
i
want
to
go
to
a
university
where
expectation
be
high
and
last
but
not
least
london
suit
our
family
life
down
to
the
ground
i
like
the
thought
that
our
son
jaakko
now
a
year
old
would
soon
become
a
little
londoner
in
london
i
would
again
follow
global
politics
and
economics
from
a
splendid
vantage
point
we
socialize
with
diplomat
and
don
our
little
boy
spent
his
day
at
the
lse
kindergarten
while
liisa
study
health
and
social
policy
and
administration
a
few
year
later
she
would
become
the
first
finnish
woman
to
take
a
degree
at
the
lse
graduate
school
i
support
liisa
s
study
and
believe
they
would
open
new
door
for
her
on
our
return
to
finland
or
perhaps
we
would
not
return
but
would
stay
and
build
inter
national
academic
career
london
be
not
at
its

the
economy

the

found
it
hard
to
control

while
i
spent
my
time
study
the
theoretical

friedman
britain
be
on
a
crash
course
in

margaret
thatcher
would
be
elect
prime
minister
in
may
against
a
background
of
skepticism

against
all
odds
and
hostility
soon
she
would
become
the
pre
eminent
politician
of
the
west
ern
world
so
well
know
that
british
psychiatrist
have
to
abandon
the
ques

they
traditionally
use
to
check
if
their
patient
have
any
grasp
of

at
all
can
you
name
the
prime
minister
everyone
knew
who
she
be
the
lse
really
be
a
return
to
the
classroom
i
left
home
at
eight
and
i
be
in
the
university
until
no
later
than
nine
in
the
even
i
sat
in
lecture
hour
after
hour
in
between
we
spent
time
in
small
group
do
calcula
tion
exercise
and
of
course
i
do
some
independent
study
in
the
library
the
teach
be
a
preparation
for
continue
academic
study
it
be
very
high
level
and
intellectually
challenge
i
be
finish
off
my
m
sc
if
my
study
go
well
i
would
continue
to
a
doctorate
for
my
specialist
field
i
have
chosen
the
theory
of
the
international
monetary
economy
there
be
strong
support
in
academic
circle
for
idea
that
would
be
im
plemented
in
finland
in
the
s
such
as
the
liberalization
of
currency
market
and
the
introduction
of
float
exchange
rate
even
in
i
have
have
to
fill
in
a
form
and
send
it
to
the
bank
of
finland
so
i
could
exchange
finnish
markka
into
pound
before
we
left
for
london
london
be
also
the
most
important
foreign
outpost
of
the
chicago
school
of
neoclassical
economics
whose
most
famous
representative
be
milton
friedman
he
be
a
stern
critic
of
the
prevail
keynesianism
friedman
and
his
follower
believe
that
growth
in
the
money
supply
would
revive
the
economy
in
the
short
term
but
in
the
longer
term
would
make
itself
felt
as

be

by
public
authority
be
irrel
evant
to
long
term

success
the
role
of
government
in
economic
policy
should
be
strictly
limited
conversely
central

a

these

citibank
offer
me
a

i
would
work
first
in
london
where
i
would
study
the
working
of
the
international
money
market
while
also
learn
how
the

operate
after
that

to
citibank
s
new

there
citibank
offer
a
salary
real
work

the

recruiting
young
people
from

university
in

citibank
reckon
that
we
young
professional
would
repay
its
investment
within
ten
year
though
an
active
system
of
training
brought
this
down
to
five
or
six
year
so
from
the
bank
s
point
of
view
the
training
jorma
ollila

system
be
a
profitable
investment
in
the
future

also
brought
citibank
credibility
in
country
where
it
be
just
open
ing
up
such
as
finland
without
local
expertise
the
american
banking
giant
could
scarcely
have
compete
with
the
establish
national
bank
the
offer
from
citibank
compel
me
to
make
the
most
difficult
deci
sion
of
my
life
many
of
my
contemporary
have
already
found
their
niche
they
have
study
effectively
graduate
and
could
provide
for
their
family
and
pay
off
their
mortgage
i
wasn
t
a
bohemian
far
from
it
but
i
have
nevertheless
contrive
to
live
my
twenty
eight
year
without
serious
consid
eration
of
what
profession
i
should
follow
when
i
go
to
london
i
only
knew
it
would
be
something
in
the
academic
line
it
be
the
same
dream
i
have
take
to
atlantic
college
ten
year
earlier
that
be
perhaps
part
of
my
nature
accord
to
one
popular
analysis
people
can
be
divide
into
four
group
achiever
explorer
socializer
and
killer
the

be
more
or
less

them

company
be
more
important
than
the
result
the
common
good
and
a
feel
of
well
be
be
the
most
important
thing
with
all
due
respect
one
might
say
that
many
people
from
the
mediterranean
region
belong
to
this
type
i
be
one
of
the
achiever
achiever

we
always
want
to
take
on
a
new
project
see
it
through
to
its
conclusion
and
move
on
to
the
next
we
get
enjoyment
from
work
do
and
study
ing
our
relationship
with
other
people
come
through
our
work
we
gath

around
us
the
sort
of
people
we
can
work
with
toward
common
goal
achiever
be
always
aim
toward
something
big
something
well
toward
the
next
project
we
relish
every
success
but
our
mind
be
already
focus
on
something
else
in
london
back
in
i
didn
t
analyze
myself
in
this
way
it
be
only
later
that
i
discover
these
category
and
liisa
agree
that
i
be
definitely
one
of
the
achiever
of
course
we
all
have
element
of
each
personality
type
nothing
be
purely
black
and
white
and
fortunately
people
can
take
on
new
quality
although
i
be
only
twenty
eight
i
have
already
experienced
a
lot
of
power
game
i
have
lead
a
student
organization
i
have
negotiate
with
the
russian
i
have
become
familiar
with
party
politics
i
have
not
however
enjoy
it
and
i
be
not
sociable
enough
to
go
out
and
win
vote
from
stranger
nor
do
power
structure
or
power
itself
interest
me
enough
for
me
to
crave
a
seat
in
parliament
or
a
job
in
the
foreign
ministry
i
simply
want
to
achieve
thing
i
want
good
thing
to
happen
i
be
always
delighted
when
the

against
all
odds
national
union
of
student
won
well
financial
term
or
living
condition
for
its
member
if
i
could
say
to
myself
that
i
have
do
thing
right
that
be
enough
for
me
an
achiever
must
always
have
something
to
do
achiever
be
usually
cu
rious
about
thing
because
new
knowledge
make
new
achievement
po
sible
an
achiever
doesn
t
need
too
much
social
life
or
external
recognition
the
achievement
be
its
own
reward
however
the
achiever
will
be
deeply
hurt
if
the
value
of
his
or
her
achievement
isn
t
recognize
or
if
it
s
dispar
age
achiever
keep
the
promise
they
make
to
others
but
also
the
one
they
make
to
themselves
and
it
s
the
one
they
make
to
themselves
that
be
the
most
difficult
in
i
have
promise
myself
that
i
would
complete
my
final
dissertation
at
the
university
of
technology
and
then
go
on
to
do
my
doctorate
at
the

the
promise
to
the
british
council
weigh
on
me
a
little
but
not
as
much
as
the
promise
to
myself
think
about
it
now
in
my
sixty
i
think
that
there
may
also
have
be
a
subconscious
debt
to
my
mother
who
have
never
have
as
much
education
as
she
would
have
like
i
think
i
want
to
show
her
that
i
could
become
a
doctor
of
economics
before
the
offer
from
citibank
i
have
have
no

and
onerous
work
in
the

which
didn
t
hold
much
appeal
for
me
i
have
learn
how
in
theory
business
should
operate
in
an
economy
i
be
a
firm
believer
in
the
capitalist
system
though
i
recognize
its
weakness
finland

by
the

but
finland

the

do
have
some
sort
of
idea
of
how
business
operate
i
doubt
with
good
reason
whether
i
would
get
along

study
ing
thing
especially
as
part
of
a
large
whole
i
rather
dread
join
an
organization
that
exist
solely
to
make
money
for
its
shareholder
i
wasn
t
sure
if
i
would
find
intelligent
life
there
i
look
at
the
heavyweight
among
finnish
business
leader
and
the
question
seem
all
the
more
press
do
i
want
one
day
to
be
an
authoritarian
leader
who
make
decision
after
five
glass
of
cognac
in
some
private
din
room
do
i
want
to
stop
think
ing
and
become
a
sleek
merchant
whose
discussion
with
party
hack
from
the
soviet
union
go
on
week
after
week
to
that
question
i
certainly
knew
the
answer
wasn
t
there
something
a
little
too
easy
about
business
life
and
wouldn
t
i
have
to
give
up
my
theoretical
musing
if
i
chose
the
practical
life
in
its
place
what
would
i
say
to
all
my
friend
who
be
advance
in
their
aca
demic
career
how
would
i
explain
all
this
to
myself
if
business
life
turn
out
just
as
i
fear
mind
numb
even
mindless
profit
make
spice
up
with
opportunistic
power
game
the
offer
from
citibank
compel
me
to
examine
closely
my
dream
of
an
academic
career
do
i
want
to
continue
my
research
work
on
a
small
salary
when
we
already
have
our
first
child
and
more
would
surely
follow
could
i
endure
wait
a
decade
for
my
first
professorial
appointment
and
at
heart
be
i
really
interested
in
an
academic
career
wasn
t
i
rather
a
practical
per
son
who
want
to
spend
his
whole
time
do
something
useful
be
the
lonely
toil
that
be
part
of
a
scholar
s
life
really
for
me
when
i
have
always
enjoy
the
bustle
of
work
with
others
be
my
academic
career
a
castle
in
the
air
when
in
reality
i
want
something
different
the
question
tore
me
apart
and
if
i
have
know
then
how
decisive
the
conclusion
would
be
as
far
as
my
future
be
concerned
i
would
have
surely
deliberate
even
longer
as
it
be
i
consider
my
option
throughout
au
gust
my
night
be
sleepless
i
talk
it
through
with
liisa
who
doesn
t
remember
ever
see
me
so
torn
by
a
difficult
decision
never
since
have
i
make
a
decision
that
would
have
such
a
big
impact
on
my
life
on
august
five
day
after
my
twenty
eighth
birthday
and
follow
another
sleepless
night
i
make
up
my
mind
i
would
accept
the
citibank
offer
in
business
life
i
would
perhaps
do
well
on
account
of
all
my
study
i
would
become
part
of
a
team
and
perhaps
eventually
its
captain

against
all
odds
only
much
later
do
i
realize
how
big
that
decision
really
be
for
me
all
major
decision
demand
sacrifice
in
make
this
decision
i
sacrifice
my
dream
but
i
have
never
regret
that
the
come
year
show
my
deci
sion
to
have
be
right
but
those
august
day
in
london
be
full
only
of
uncertainty
that
too
be
invariably
an
element
of
big
decision
you
can
t
plan
your
life
even
if
you
want
to
i
m
an
instinctive
rationalist
but
i
must
nevertheless
concede
that
without
a
chain
of
many
random
event
i
would
never
have
become
a
chief
executive
i
could
have
make
a
different
choice
in
london
in
which
case
i
would
now
certainly
be
a
professor
of
economics
perhaps
in
a
world
class
university
my
life
would
have
be
different
at
the
very
least
although
i
have
to
look
at
many
fundamental
factor
there
be
one
practi
cal
point
that
make
it
easy
for
me
to
reach
my
decision
i
still
hadn
t
do
my
military
service
but
now
i
couldn
t
put
it
off
any
longer
i
have
to
join
the
army
before
my
thirtieth
birthday
which
would
interrupt
the
write
of
my
doctoral
thesis
citibank
say
they
would
let
me
take
nearly
a
year
s
leave
of
absence
for
my
military
service
the
follow
day
i
told
john
quitter
who
be
responsible
for
citibank
s
scandinavian
affair
that
i
would
start
as
a

in
london
just
over
a
week
later
at
the

of

and
i
put
the
lse
s
offer
concern
my
doctorate
into
a
plastic
folder
and
then
into
an
envelope
i
would
keep
it
safe
against
the
month
and
year
ahead
in
case
i
come
to
regret
my
choice
i
have
academic
life
insurance
if
business
life
disappointed
all
my
expectation
and
make
my
nightmare
come
true
the
lse
s
letter
be
still
in
safekeeping
in
my

also
my
first
proper
place
of
work
it
be
a
demand
environment
for
a
young
economist
i
have
research
the
bank
s
history
it
have
be
found
in
as
the
city
bank
of
new
york
with
an
initial
capital
of
million
by
it
be
the
big
bank
in
the
united

and
by
the

of
the
century

citibank
undertook
foreign
currency
transaction
earlier
and
more
wide
ly
than
any
other

citibank
be
a
formi
dable
international
financial
institution
perhaps
that
be
what
interested
me
most
i
knew
i
could
learn
from
citibank
everything
there
be
to
learn
about
international
banking
it
be
also
a
prototypical
global
enterprise
with
structure
design
for
effective
international
operation
perhaps
only
ibm
which
also
begin
international
operation
much
earlier
than
other
company
could
compete
with
it
in
term
of
effectiveness
in
fact
ibm
have
be
the
first
company
to
design
its
organizational
structure
rather
than
let
it
grow
organically
its
idea
be
later
widely
copy
when
i
join
the
rank
of
citibank

be
lead
by
the
legendary

internationalism
and
a
strong
belief
in

customer
some
regard
him
as
too
radical
for
example
he
foresaw
the
use
of
automate
teller
machine
and
everyday
electronic
transaction
when
these

to
belong
to
the

of
science

back
in

how

citibank
politely
kept
this
promise
i
don

know
exactly
why
citibank

me
i
suppose
someone
at
the
finnish
embassy
may
have
suggest
me

by
the
experienced
banker
john

of
my
life
but
the
change
also
have
a
more
immediate
impact
liisa
and
i
at
last
have
some
money
citibank
paid
a
salary
positively
ducal
compare
to
student
loan
we
quickly
give
up
our
student
flat
in
akehurst

just
half
a
mile
or
so

match
my

we
weren
t
sure
that
we
would
find

be
paid
enough
to
get
by
i
wasn

i
naturally
want
to
be
sure
that
our

would
have
enough
we
start

about

long
wonder
whether

intellectually
stimulate
i

brood
on

position
in

if
the

of

about

he
probably
would
have

that

unpatriotic

citibank
make
a
salesperson
of
me
i
didn
t
find
it
easy
at
first
i
be
an
analytical
person
and
through
my
education
and
experience
i
have
set
out
to
become
the
sort
of
expert
who
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
customer
and
my
finnish
and
nordic
nature
didn
t
give
me
a
head

on
the
role
of
a
sleek
salesman
but
citibank
s
global
organization
be
a
good
teacher

learn
how
to
approach
customer
and
how
to
put
together
proposal
that
be
hard
to
refuse
i
learn
too
how
customer
should
be
take
care
of
at
every
stage
you
must
persuade
customer
that
you
really
care
and
be
ready
to
do
pretty
well
anything
for
them
and
i
learn
the
subversive
truth
business
even
international
bank
live
or
die
by
satisfy
ing
their
customer
if
i
hadn
t
learn
about
customer
service
at
citibank
i
could
never
have
succeed
at
nokia
where
i
always
regard
myself
as
the
company
s
most
senior
salesperson
citibank
also
become
for
me
the
model
of
a
global
organization
it
have
a
matrix
structure
which
work
efficiently
and
well
a
matrix
organization
be
one
where
management
take
place
across
both
function
and
business
group
and
an
individual
have
more
than
one
reporting
line
a
matrix
struc
ture
be
see
as
the
natural
and
indeed
only
practical
model
for
an
interna
tional
company
operating
in
several
area
i
understood
that
a
strong
company
must
have
a
strong
culture
back
then
i
have
no
idea
that
company
have
culture
but
i
saw
in
practice
how
a
strong
culture
influence
the
way
citibank
look
after
its
business
and
its
custom
er
this
hadn
t
happen
overnight
what
s
more
the
bank
s
culture
and
its
leadership
model
be
interlinked
the
head
office
and
the
front
line
have
to
understand
each
other
and
this
require
continuous
effort
excellent
two
way
communication
be
essential
citibank
want
to
be
the
front
runner
in
all
form
of
new
technology
and
communication
so
in
i
be
already
use
an
email
system
developed
for
internal
use
i
join
nokia
in
but
the
company
use
email
only
from
the
end
of
that
decade
citibank
de
veloped
its
internal
technical
ability
while
sell
its
customer
a
vision
of
make
money
electronic
my
citibank
training
turn
my
own
think
upside
down
only
later
do
i
realize
how
widely
what
i
have
learn
could
be
apply
i
drew
on
this
new
knowledge
both
consciously
and
subliminally
at
nokia
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
when
i
join
citibank
i
be
an
economist
pure
and
simple
i
knew
nothing
of
balance
sheet
for
example
everything
i
learn
about
how
to
analyze
a
company
i
learn
from
citibank
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
i
also
learn
a
great
deal
about
how
to
manage
people
in
large
organiza
tions
earlier
i
have
thought
that
organization
meant
a
diagram
make
out
of
box
join
to
each
other
by
thin
line
i
thought
that
the
leader
s
job
be
to
lead
this
organization
at
citibank
i
learn
the
revolutionary
truth
the
leader
do
not
lead
box
or
an
organization
but
people
a
leader
even
in
a
big
organization
have
to
be
interested
in
the
people
whose
effort
create
the
result
good
leader
must
know
their
people
a
good
leader
must
also
be
ready
to
promote
some
surprising
people
within
the
organization
without
regard
to
the
official
box
at
citibank
it
be
understood
that
the
organiza
tion
have
to
be
clear
but
must
allow
flexibility
for
which
good
internal
com
munications
and
respect
for
people
be
essential
my
role

gift

he
could
chat
as
easily
with
someone

thread
of

men
have
to
prepare
themselves
for
unemployment
which
be
something
quite
new
in
finland
in
my
last
month
in
the
army
i
held
an
office
job
in
helsinki
at
the
na
tional
board
of
economic
defense
i
prepared
a
study
of
the
economics
of
finland
s
defense
at
a
time
of
crisis
in
the
evening
i
sat
in
the
library
and
work
on
my
dissertation
for
the
university
of

the
subject
be
economic

as
a
theoretical
problem

apply
system
theory
to
economic

i
receive
the
best
possible
grade
for
it
i
suppose
it
come
in
useful
later
on
too
when
i
have
to
understand
the
process
at
work
in
a
large
enterprise
at
least
it
help
me
develop
useful
way
of
think
both
my
dissertation
have
be
thought
experiment
that
prove
useful
later
but
the
great
benefit
of
my
time
at
the
university
of
technology
be
practical
i
learn
how
finnish
engineer
think
and
i
gain
credibility
in
their
eye
they
saw
me
as
one
of
themselves
though
my
qualification
for
that
status
be
rather
slender
much
later
at
nokia
i
desperately
need
that
credibility
thanks
to
the
army
i
receive
a
crash
course
in
what
finland
be
all
about
up
until
then
i
have
live
an
elitist
life
isolated
and
insulate
from
my
fellow
finn
as
a

i
have
spent
my
time
in
agreeable

with
other

before

take
me
away
from

after

i
have

my
employer
be
an

which
certainly
didn
t
offer
a
panoramic
view
of
finland
without
the
army
i
wouldn
t
have
know
much
about
what

t
he
s
begin
for
me
over
half
a
year
late
in
the
autumn
when
i
left
the
army
to
return
to
citibank
and
the
real
world
the
atmosphere
be
now
quite
different
from
the
over
politicize
seventy
new
routine
and
challenge
await
me
and
the
change
be
welcome
i
become
an
ex
pert
on
company
finance
i
be
the
new
boy
in
the
helsinki
office
and
natu
rally
i
have
to
deal
with
the
most
awkward
customer
these
difficult
customer
be
finland
s
major
company
who
have
close

to
finland
s
big

from
the

there
be

try
to

to

w
rtsil
and
nokia
fin
land
be
still
a

where

reign
supreme
but
in

there
be

where
citibank
be
in
a
position
to
add
value

out

for
nokia
rauma
repola
for
its
part
be
look
after
by
the
bank
of
america
even
so
i
roll
up
my
sleeve
and
get
down
to
work
i
now
have
to
put
into
practice
everything
i
have
learn
in
london
about
customer
care
and
negotiation
i
mostly
dealt
with
finance
director
of
my
age
or
a
little
old
they
certainly
saw
how
the
world
be
change
and
want
to
know
how
to
change
with
it
usually
their
problem
be
a
fifty
five
year
old
finance
director
stuck
in
his
way
and
unable
to
manage
his
ambitious
subordinate
effectively
i
go
assiduously
to
cocktail
party
i
forge
link
with
economic
edi
tor
which
would
stand
me
in
good
stead
later
citibank
usually
get
curi
ously
positive
publicity
because
in
the
finnish
finance
world
it
seem
to
have
expertise
and
to
be
both
small
and
challenge
citibank
could
offer
a
breath
of
fresh
global
think
to
the

world
which
be
just
jorma
ollila
and

opening
up
three
small
foreign

be
a

example

would
have
to
take

their

to
protect
their
domestic
market
from

its
own

which
have
also
set
up

abroad
the

would
surely
expect
to
receive
a
license
for
its
own
bank
to
operate
in
helsinki
to
ensure
balance
but
official
also
have
many
good
reason
to
open
finland
up
to
international
banking
competition
the
international
capital
market
still
have
a
slightly
vague
picture
of
finland
we
finn
paid
a
high
price
for
soviet
neighborliness
in
a
literal
sense
because
the
soviet
union
be
know
to
have
an
influence
on
finnish
policy
we
have
to
pay
a
premium
for
a
politi
cal
risk
that
be
practically
non
existent
but
then
the
market
have
never
be
particularly
good
at
distinguish
detail
besides
the
soviet
union
s
share
of
finland
s
foreign
trade
be
so
great
that
it
pose
a
risk
to
finland
s
economy
as

whole
and
finland
be
one
of
those
dubious
nordic
social
democratic
country
whose
commitment
to
capitalism
seem
a
little
un
certain
at
least
in
the
eye
of
american
investor
finnish
politician
and
official
must
certainly
have
expect
american
bank
office
in
helsinki
to
send
home
the
right
signal
about
finland
and
finnish

as
a
de
tination
for

as
indeed
they
do

also
want
to
open
up

compel
finnish
bank
to
modernize
foreign

less

citibank

to

in

and
start

follow

er
i
myself
have
no
experience
of
the
finnish
banking
system
since
i
have
undergone
citibank
s
american
education
instead
i
thought
that
a
bank
s
job
be
to
offer
effective
financial
and
capital
service
often
against
tough
competition
rather
than
to
own
manage
or
sell
its
customer
business
customer
should
be
able
to
do
that
for
themselves
if
their
business
go
well
our
customer
would
be
sure
to
make
money
for
citibank
too
at
ci
tibank
we
believe
strongly
in
banking
competition
because
we
be
use
to
operating
in
the
world
s
most
competitive
market
with
every
finnish
customer
we
be
the
competitor
the
challenger
and
the
alternative
to
the
finnish
bank
in
citibank
s
helsinki
office
i
built
up
my
own
team
respon
sible
for
half
of
citibank
s
corporate
financing
in
finland
i
be
happy
with
them

i
met
many
interest
senior
people
at
that
time
whom
i
get
to
know
well
later
on
for
example
i
met
pekka
herlin
of
kone
over
lunch
in
the
early
s
herlin
be
a
taciturn
and
grumpy
figure
but
he
conveyed
au
thority
and
gravitas
it
wasn
t
his
role
as
the
owner
of
a
major
company
that
give
weight
to
his
word
but
his
vision
and
his
grasp
of
the
issue
the
gruff
ness
of
his
persona
add
its
own
mystique
there
be
a
lively
discussion
at
the
lunch
table
of
the
international
economic
situation
high
interest
rate
and
the
sustainability
of
the

herlin
make

he
be
always
the
hub
of
the
conversation
jorma
ollila

liisa
and
i
have
settle
down
on
the

a

though
i
be
sorry
to
say
that
i
be
five
minute
late
for
matti
we
have
a
lively
discussion
about
that
most
of
the
housework
fell
to
liisa
even
though
she
be
building
her
own
career
as
a

but
i
iron
my

up

there
we
do

and
met
our

have
an

particularly
not
in

i
would
never
go
back
to
be
an
academic
i
have
to
keep
go
forward

perhaps
it
be
because
i
have
left

now
thirty
four
and
as
i
look
around
citibank
i
saw
lot
of
eager
professional
many
of
whom
be
ten
year
young
than
me
that
make
me
want
to
accelerate
my
career
i
want
to
get
on
a
faster
track
one
that
offer
broader
vista
than
ci
tibank
s
little
helsinki
office
i
have
really
enjoy
london
where
the
world
be
big
the
work
international
and
i
could
feel
i
be
develop
the
whole
time
i
didn
t
feel
that
in
helsinki
once
i
have
my
foot
under
the
desk
there
and
establish
my
team
it
be
natural
to
start
look
for
the
next
thing
citibank
have
be
my
school
of
leadership
i
ve
notice
since
that
leader
learn
to
lead
between
the
age
of
twenty
five
and
thirty
five
it
s
a
critical
pe
riod
the
time
when
you
need
a
good
model
of
leadership
if
you
re
to
become
a
leader
yourself
the
model
stick
in
the
mind
and
help
you
create
your
own
style
of
work
and
also
your
own
expectation
of
what
others
can
of
fer
if
leader
be
bad
lazy
or
dishonest
they
will
pas
on
the
wrong
model
of
leadership
to
the
next
generation
who
will
turn
out
suspicious
cynical
or
downright
incompetent
they
may
become
people
who
be
always
on
the
lookout
for
conspiracy
or
gratuitously
engage
in
corrosive
office
politics
if
a
crooked
leader
deceives
his
subordinate
the
iron
will
enter
their
soul
they
will
find
it
difficult
to
recover
or
to
believe
in
any
leader
ever
again
so
good
role
model
be
a
matter
of
life
and
death
for
every
enterprise
indeed
i
be
lieve
that
in
the
bad
case
a
company
can
die
if
the
model
of
leadership
fails
citibank
didn
t
supply
a
unique
model
of
leadership
but
it
offer
an
ex
cellent
example
of
corporate
culture
the
bank
be
international
and
have
several
set
of
value
to
the
point
where
some
found
it
chaotic
but
it
have
a

against
all
odds
large
measure
of
that
dynamism
that
i
both
value
and
have
lack
as
well
as
a
strong
sense
of
share
purpose
its
top
management
be
marketer
for
the
bank
who
promote
their
product
and
met
with
client
not
even
walter
wriston
could
close
the
door
to
his
office
to
enjoy
an
exalt
solitude
the
american
culture
demand
that
everyone
throw
themselves
into
the
job
in
order
to
achieve
the
bank
s
goal
i
learn
this
way
of
think
at
citibank
and
take
it
with
me
to
nokia
i
compel
myself
and
my
senior
team
to
travel
the
world
meeting
custom
er
learn
new
thing
and
sell
our
product
perhaps
i
would
have
un
derstood
all
this
without
citibank
but
i
wouldn
t
have
see
how
a
business
culture
affect
the
way
one
work
of
course
citibank
make
mistake
and
i
try
to
learn
from
those
as
well
i
wasn
t
an
easy
subordinate
for
anyone
when
john
quitter
come
from
london
to
visit
the
helsinki
office
i
arrange
a
private
breakfast
with
him
i
tapped
on
the
table
with
my
finger
as
i
sometimes
do
and
told
him
i
wasn
t
happy
with
the
way
my
career
be
develop
i
lack
opportunity
to
get
ahead
liisa
who
be
work
at
the
ministry
of
social
affair
and
health
have
be
offer
an
international
job
in
geneva
but
citibank
have
nothing
to
offer
me
there
it
be
a
disappointment
for
both
of
us
john
quitter
listen
to
my
outpouring
sympathetically
but
didn
t
say
much
in
response
because
he
surely
understood
that
i
wouldn
t
be
at
ci
tibank
for
much
longer
i
often
use
to
talk
thing
through
with
him
later
after
i
have
left
citibank
i
knew
that
if
i
stayed
there
i
would
be
offer
the
opportunity
to
gain
experience
in
a
large
market
perhaps
in
another
nor
dic
country
the
united
state
or
latin
america
but
in
citibank
s
structure
in
helsinki
i
be
at
the
third
level
down
even
if
i
have
go
abroad
and
return
to
finland
the
best
i
could
hope
for
be
to
become
second
in
command
that
wasn
t
enough
for
me
i
knew
my
worth
and
i
be
impatient
to
get
on
i
be
already
over
thirty
and
have
no
time
to
squander
and
there
be
other
thing
on

powerful

discuss
the
question
and
i
promise
to
consider
the
offer
a
couple
of
week
later
i
told
them
i
didn
t
wish
to
pursue
it
one
of
them
told
me
later
that
my
response
have
cause
great
consternation
in
the
finland
of
the
early
s
one
didn
t
lightly
refuse
such
offer
i
receive
another
offer
too
this
come
from
eva
a
think
tank
establish
to
put
the
case
for
the
market
economy
and
to
counter
the
simple
mind

have
a
couple
of
discussion
about
a
possible
move
to
eva
which
lead
to
a
job
offer
but
again
i
didn
t
take
it
look
back
that
be
fortunate
for
me
and
indeed
for
eva
too
i
be
just
about
to
move
into
the
right
line
of
business
that
s
where
my
future
lay
though
i
have
never
cease
to
follow
politics
or
try
to
influence
develop
ments
in
society
it
s
just
that
i
ve
do
so
in
my
role
as
a
business
leader
my
path
do
eventually
lead
me
to
eva
since
i
have
be
chairman
of
its
board
by
my
own
reckon
i
have
achieve
a
great
deal
at
citibank
the
cor
porate
finance
portfolio
have
grown
more
and
more
major
finnish
firm
come
to
us
we
be
trust
my
little
team
understood
the
customer
i
have
learn
important
thing
about
myself
the
world
of
business
really
be
the
place
for
me
though
i
wasn
t
entirely
happy
at
citibank
i
have
nevertheless
make
the
right
decision
in
london
i
still
have
that
yellow
piece
of
paper
which
guaranteed
the
chance
to
return
to
an
academic
career
and
to
complete
my
doctoral
dissertation
i
bury
it
deeper
in
my
archive

against
all
odds
chapter
i
move
to
nokia
d
epending
on
your
world
view
you
may
see
life
as
a
matter
of
chance
or
of
destiny
or
you
may
even
detect
the
hand
of
god
my
view
be
that
everything
affect
everything
else
although
i
also
believe
that
people
can
help
shape
their
own
destiny
it
be
purely
by
chance
that
i
become
a
businessman
a
banker
and
an
executive
at
citibank
that
wouldn
t
have
happen
if
i
d
follow
my
original
plan
in
the
autumn
of
i
intend
to
spend
one
more
year
at
citibank
i
want
to
leave
the
bank
with
the
title
of
vice
president
which
would
require
far
arduous
training
and
the
achievement
of
set
objective
i
would
then
leave
citibank
and
find
something
else
to
do
i
assume
that
would
be
some
thing
to
do
with
corporate
finance
no
power
in
the
universe
could
have
interested
me
even
then
in
any
opening
at
a
finnish
bank
i
could
see
all
too
easily
that
life
for
the
big
finnish
bank
would
soon
become
rather
more
problematic
in
september
my
phone
rang
at
the
end
of
the
line
it
must
have
be
a
landline
be
the
personal
assistant
to
the
ceo
of
nokia
kari
kai
ramo
she
have
rung
to
invite
me
to
meet
him
and
his
colleague
simo
vuo
rilehto
president
of
nokia
a
few
day
later
i
sat
in
a
private
din
room
in
a
helsinki
restaurant
with
nokia
s
two
top
men
they
be
well
know
figure
in
finnish
industry
though
i
didn
t
know
either
personally
and
both
be
about
twenty
year
old
than
me
by
the
time
our
chat
be
over
kari
kairamo
be
clearly
fret
ting
that
we
d
fail
to
meet
before
vuorilehto
say
scarcely
a
word
while
kairamo
talk
non
stop
he
be
a
wonderful
salesman
and
now
he
be
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
sell
me
a
job
at
nokia
he
say
he
d
heard
a
lot
of
good
thing
about
me
nokia
want
to
hire
some
promising
young
people
to
bring
new
blood
and
new
idea
into
the
company
later
on
we
would
see
just
how
the
com
pany
actually
make
use
of
those
people
kari
kairamo
be
every
inch
the
charismatic
leader
his
gaze
be
pierc
ing
but
he
barely
seem
to
have
the
patience
to
stay
in
one
place
he
wore
spectacle
with
large
frame
and
his
hair
be
recede
from
his
temple
though
it
have
not
yet
go
gray
he
like
to
dress
tastefully
and
stylishly
but
in
a
hurry
he
forgot
to
tuck
his
shirt
in
he
ran
nokia
in
his
shirtsleeve
and
he
detest
all
other
formality
as
well
kairamo
have
no
need
to
emphasize
his
own
position
he
come
from
a
famous
family
of
finnish
industrialist
which
guaranteed
a
certain
degree
of
self
assurance
i
be
interested
in
his
offer
because
citibank
s
helsinki
office
have
nothing
more
to
teach
me
until
i
receive
nokia
s
offer
the
alternative
face
me
be
either
to
go
abroad
or
perhaps
to
develop
investment
banking
service
in
finland
the
finnish
capital
market
be
just
opening
up
the
service
offer
by
bank
be
change
rapidly
and
individual
wealth
be
grow
too
but
then
i
would
be
do
what
i
have
already
do
for
year
i
be
ambitious
and
want
to
go
somewhere
where
i
could
achieve
more
nokia
be
just
such
an
enterprise
although
it
be
a
mixed
collection
of
bit
of
different
industry
a
conglomerate
it
be
a
finnish
company
step
on
to
the
international
stage
kari
kairamo
ran
the
business
briskly
there
be
much
that
need
update
at
nokia
but
that
would
give
me
the
chance
to
make
change
there
of
course
i
knew
nokia
as
a
customer
i
have
study
the
company
i
have
sell
it
financial
service
and
i
have
have
frequent
discussion
with
its
finance
people
i
knew
its
strength
and
weakness
one
friend
recall
me
banging
on
about
how
nokia
could
never
hope
to
thrive
while
it
have
so
many
dif
ferent
division
in
such
varied
field
as
mobile
telephone
and
toilet
paper
i
knew
that
nokia
have
to
decide
what
it
want
to
focus
on
but
that
insight
be
essentially
a
banker
s
theoretical
muse
i
really
didn
t
know
what
go
on
inside
the
company
or
what
its
top
management
thought
in
the
early
s
nokia
have
grown
to
become
finland
s
most
impor
tant
electronics
company
it
make
television
telephone
exchange
mobile
phone
and
computer
i
instinctively
thought
that
its
future
should
lie
somewhere
other
than
in
make
paper
rubber
boot
or
cable
i
genuinely
thought
that
finn
too
could
conquer
the
world
with
new
product
and
for
my
own
part
which
would
not
initially
be
a
large
role
i
be
ready
to
join
this
great
adventure
i
do
not
yet
see
the
risk
nokia
would
later
encounter

against
all
odds
nor
do
i
see
that
kari
kairamo
himself
would
become
a
risk
to
the
com
pany
on
the
contrary
kairamo
be
the
most
dynamic
figure
in
finnish
business
life
his
company
be
the
product
of
his
international
vision
he
try
to
fend
off
the
power
hungry
finnish
commercial
bank
i
agree
with
him
on
practically
every
major
issue
and
he
be
regard
as
an
exception
ally
inspire
leader
an
assessment
i
found
it
easy
to
agree
with
after
our
first
meeting
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
attractive
a
move
to

try

still

the

agreement
be
sign
at
the
begin

everything
should
have
be
fine
george
soros
would
have
make
a
sound
investment

nokia
would
have
receive
fresh
capital
to
the
sum
of

but
in
a
few
month
nothing
be
fine
nokia
s

have
begin
to
rise
briskly
we
sus
pected
that
someone
might
deliberately
try
to
ramp
up
nokia

we
have
agree
with
soros
that
the
two
category
of

he
be
buy
ing
should
be
price
at

for
these

the

we
have
thought
the

on

furious
they
give
notice
that
they
want
to

while
in
the

no
one
understood
what
the

be
about
though
in
every

large

luxembourg
there
be
regional
difference
and
people
in
the
big

sophisticated
these

significant

know
a
lawyer
in
nokia

legal
department
name
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
he
stood
out
from
the
crowd
because
his
opinion
be
always
analytical
and
very
much
his
own
in
spring
i
request
that
he

from
the
legal

department
which
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
i
have
take
charge
of
i
could
discus
finance
with
him
as
part
of
nokia

broader
strategy
since
he
have
be
closely

in
much
of

i
be
a

but
in
the
mid
s
no

very
interested
in
that

practical
experience
in

october
monday
back
in
olli

and
i
be

in
my

in
nokia

old

we
be
star
at
a
reuters
computer
screen
which
nowadays
would
seem
just
as
clumsy
as
a
s
black
and
white
television
the
terminal
displayed
green
numeral
that
told
us
that
the
new
york
stock
exchange
be
sinking
rapidly
and
inexplicably
the
fi
nancial
panic
spread
from
new
york
around
the
world
this
be
our
stock
exchange
crash
the
of
my
generation
we
star
at
the
figure
but
we
didn
t
understand
what
be
happen
we
try
to
call
people
we
knew
to
find
out
firsthand
what
be
go
on
but
it
wasn
t
easy
to
get
through
to
new
york
nokia
wasn
t
list
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
but
we
knew
this
would
impact
the
company
s
share
price
in
london
and
helsinki
where
the
company
be
list
that
spring
with
kari
kairamo
s
support
we
have
float
nokia
on
the
london
stock
exchange
a
courageous
step
for
a
finn
ish
company
and
a
vital
one
if
nokia
be
to
transform
itself
into
a
company
attractive
to
international
investor
it
would
guarantee
the
company
access
to
new
finance
and
make
it
more
independent
of
the
micro
management
of
the
finnish
bank
now
we
star
at
the
little
green
number
dart
across
the
screen
and
try
to
work
out
whether
our
dream
be
over
be
the
stock
exchange
of
the
world
enter
a
last
depression

and
capital
operation
have
their
day
have
we
go
back
to
the
stone
age
where
international
finance
be
concerned
would
small
investor
ever
regain
their
confidence
in
the
stock
market
later
the
great
stock
market
crash
of
october
would
turn
out
to
be
much
small
than
we
have
imagine
at
the
time
share
recover
their
pre
vious
level
by
the
follow
year
nevertheless
black
monday
in
october
take
its
place
in
history
when
the
reason
for
the
crash
be
investi

it
turn
out
that
programmed

have
automatically
trigger
sale
on
such
a
massive
scale
that
the
market
couldn
t
cope
and
so
it
crashed
this
happen
when
both
the
economy
and
the
stock
exchange
be
at
a
very
high
level
what
go
up
must
come
down
and
now
it
be
the
stock
market
s
turn
october
be
also
the
first
indication
that
the
financial
market
have
really
go
global
the
crash
in
new
york
affected
the
stock
exchange
in
london
paris
frankfurt
stockholm
and
helsinki
the
secondary
effect
would
be
much
great
but
in
we
receive
a
foretaste
of
what
be
to
come
ten
year
later
by
then
small
investor
would
be
use
system
that
have
previously
be
available
only
to
professional
trader
we
sat
there
late
into
the
night
a
hard
day
s
night
it
have
be
a
tense
day
for
us
especially
since
we
be
both
young
i
be
thirty
seven
and
olli
pe
kka
thirty
four
it
left
us
with
a
last
sense
of
uncertainty
but
with
the
sure
knowledge
that
no
rise
in
a
share
price
could
last
forever
the
work
of
de
cades
major
investment
and
the
entire
value
of
company
could
be
wipe
away
by
the
market
in
a
matter
of
minute
later
neither
of
us
ever
want
to
invest
nokia
s
cash
reserve
in
the
equity
market
we
manage
to
resist
that
temptation
even
when
many
people
regard
us
as
too
conservative
as
the
even
go
on
we
wonder
what
the
future
held
what
would
happen
to
nokia
its
major
acquisition
be
just
under
way
would
the
world
still
provide
a
market
for
nokia
s
product
or
would
that
melt
away
how
would
thing
go
for
us
at
nokia
these
be
the
question
go
around
in
my
head
as
i
drove
home
in
my
volvo
that
monday
even
outside
it
be
dark
damp
and
treacherous
and
a

that
october

it

i
have
make
an
early
assessment
of
nokia
when
i
be
a
young
analyst
at
citibank
the
company
be
too
diverse
for
example
follow
a
reorga
nization
in
it
have
nine
separate
division
and
it
own
subsidiary
produce
everything
from
battery
to
hunt
weapon
the
company
have
to
focus
on
something
fast
i
thought
it
should
give
up
on
paper
consumer
electronics
and
its
cable
business
and
concentrate
on
electronics
but
then
again
cable
produce
a
healthy
cash
flow
of
course
at
that
time
i
wasn
t
in
a
position
where
i
could
decide
nokia
s
future
direction
it
take
a
year
to
get
out
of
paper
and
it
need
some
sticky
negotiation
and
some
sweaty
journey
to
the
united
state
london
and
italy
it
be
the
first
project
where
i
sell

the

my
duty
to
do
so
nokia
have
to
find
an
international
partner
but
where
how
could
we
ar
range
matter
so
that
the
sale
would
seem
a
genuine
example
of
coopera
tion
who
would
pay
what
and
to
whom
would
we
use
share
or
money
as
our
mean
of
payment
what
do
we
really
want
and
what
would
be
good
for
finland
if
nokia
make
the
wrong
decision
the
finnish
medium
and
finnish
politician
wouldn
t
miss
the
opportunity
to
attack
us
the
moment
the
deal
be
conclude
nokia
s
top
management
be
very
short
of
international
expertise

truth
be
that

lose
an
entire
generation
the
company
s
president
kari
kairamo
and

the
first
of
the

the
swedish

per
karls

and
would
sit
on
the

an
investment
banker
at
the
svenska
enskilda

and
formerly
the
head
of
ikea
in
germany
he
be
on
the
small
side
bespecta
cled
cheerful
and
courteous
he
be
soft
spoken
but
far
from
soft
head
he
be
able
to
find
innovative
solution
to
difficult
strategic
problem
that
others
have
try
and
fail
to
resolve
he
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
many
industrial
sector
one
of
his
area
of
expertise
be
tissue

against
all
odds
tion
i
have
first
met
him
in
london
in
at
the
time
of
nokia
s
listing
on
the
london
stock
exchange
his
colleague
roger
gifford
have
invite
us
to
watch
the
tennis
at
wimbledon
i
remember
i
won
a
five
pound
bet
on
who
would
be
champion
per
karlsson
have
earlier
have
discussion
with
nokia
about
our
tissue
pa
per
division
we
have
talk
about
an
alliance
with
holmen
hygiene
a
swed
ish
firm
we
have
also
make
an
offer
involve
the
formation
of
a
european
company
to
sell
though
the
term
weren
t
clear
and
wouldn
t
become
clear
until
we
be
certain
that
there
be
no
alternative
to
sell
it
if
this
sound
confuse
that
s
because
it
be
sometime
in
the
spring
of
per
karlsson
and
roger
gifford
come
to
my
office
in
nokia
s
headquarters
in
the
heart
of
helsinki
they
told
me
bluntly
that
nokia
couldn
t
make
a
profit
as
a
lone
player
in
the
european
tissue
paper
market
so
it
would
be
best
for
nokia
to
sell
out
straight
away
per
karlsson
have
good
contact
in
the
paper
industry
and
he
reckon
that
an
american
company
call
james
river
might
be
interested
in
buying
out
our
tissue
paper
division
at
ten
o
clock
one
swedish
spring
even
he
picked
up
the
phone
in
stockholm
and
rang
brenton
halsey
at
james
river
the
switchboard
ask
per
which
brenton
halsey
do
you
want
to
talk
with
per
be
dumbstruck
for
a
moment
he
have
forgotten
that
a
father
and
son
team
ran
the
company
he
chose
brenton
halsey
senior
who
hap
pen
to
be
the
right
one
during
this
call

to

he
travel
to
richmond
virginia
where
james
riv
er
inc
be
base
the
company
be
proud
of
its
history
and
reputation
a
cannon
from
the
american
civil
war
be
on
display
at
its
headquarters
brenton
halsey
for
his
part
assure
us
that
his
company
be
honest
and
straight
in
all
matter
this
i
would
find
out
for
myself
later
as
the
nego
tiations
advanced
these
negotiation
be
not
always
easy
however
the
sale
of
our
paper
division
become
a
process
that
try
my
patience
intensely
when
the
negotiation
begin
money
wasn
t
the
question
uppermost
in
our
mind
but
as
they
continued
nokia
s
cash
reserve
dwindle
now
we
badly
need
the
money
the
sale
of
the
paper
division
would
bring
sell
a
com
pany
be
always
difficult
in
any
such
sale
there
be
always
a
million
reason
why
one
shouldn
t
be
do
it
there
s
always
someone
who
think
it
s
too
expensive
or
too
uncertain
or
otherwise
a
stupid
thing
to
do
and
what
s
more
they
re
very
often
right
someone
really
have
to
push
for
the
sale
to
take
place
in
order
for
it
to
happen
on
top
of
that
practical
matter
may
turn
out
to
be

their
bit
if
the

be
to
be
successful
and
even
that
wasn

enough
because
nokia

would
still
have
to
agree
to
the
term
of
the
deal
for
me
this
be
all

and

didn

want

against
all

logjammed
for
several
month
it
resume
again
only
in
december
when
kairamo
s
view
be
no
longer
decisive
and
a
pre

a
lot
about

at
the
time
that
the
board
member
who
sign
it
harry
mildh
have
played
no
part
at
all
in
the
negotiation
he
just
happen
to
occupy
the
right
seat
on
the
board
olli
pekka
and
i
knew
very
little
about
paper
production
or
to
be
honest
about
the
paper
industry
in
general
we
be
technocrat
and
it
be
our
job
to
see
this
operation
through
to
the
end
because
we
believe
it
be
a
matter
of
necessity
for
nokia
when
we
present
the
deal
to
the
board
i
explain
the
background
which
show
that
the
tissue
paper
division
be
profitable
but
the
outlook
for
growth
be
weak
also
nokia
be
less
profitable
than
its
international
competitor
in
this
sector
the
aim
of
these
explanation
be
of
course
to
build
up
the
case
for
the
deal
such
deal
never
run
accord
to
the
timetable
unexpected
problem
cropped
up
in
this
project
too
the
ownership
arrangement
become
ever
more
complex
olli
pekka
kept
an
eye
on
the
legal
aspect
and
we
also
en
gag
the
service
of
tomas
lindholm
at
one
of
the
top
helsinki
law
firm
he
described
the
deal
as
the
most
complex
of
his
career
he
become
my
trust
lawyer
whom
i
call
on
again
later
when

in
a
tight
corner

of

of
the

give
an
ill
temper
speech
in
which
he
say
the
sale
be
a
mistake
it
would
have
be
well
to
sell
off
nokia
s
consumer
electronics
division
instead
he
be
both
right
and
wrong
the
consumer
electronics
arm
have
to
be
sell
in
any
case
sell
it
would
be
the
next
long
and
arduous
process
we
have
to
go
through
but
we
be
also
right
to
sell
the
paper
division
our
keenness
to
sell
it
be
sharpen
by
the
knowledge
that
nokia

it
would
have
do
immense
damage
to

imperturbability
the

which
nokia
begin
year
ago
later
in
january
nokia
would
sell
its
share
in
the

thus
nokia
have
take
its
first
big
step
in
move
toward
a
new
age
and
a
new
scene
of

be
financially
sound
for
nokia
by
my
calculation
nokia
profit
from
the
sale
of
its
paper
division
to
the
tune
of
about
million
at
rate
the
deal
include
some
term
very
favorable
to
nokia
regard
exchange
rate
the
price
would
rise
to
nokia
s
advantage
right
up
to
the
very
day
the
deal
become
binding
i
don
t
know
what
fredrik

would
have
make
of
our
deal
his
brainchild
have
survive
and
turn
a
profit
for
year
in
that
time
nokia
have
fortunately
have
new
idea
and
move
into
new
field
perhaps
he
would
have

and
i
understood
well
how
big
organization
be
run
the
deal
i
have
just
conclude
didn
t
make
me
a
great
enthusiast
for
merger
or
acquisition
at
the
same
time
i
sense
that
we
still
have
to
divest
ourselves
of
consumer
electronics
rubber
prod
ucts
and
cable
that
would
provide
work
for
the
come
year
when
i
later
become
chief
executive
of
nokia
i
wouldn
t
do
much
in
that
line
nokia
would
concentrate
on
organic
growth
in
a
grow
market
there
be
always
so
many
risk
in
m
a
it
s
not
worth
buying
a
fail
business
and
a
successful
one
be
never
for
sale
at
an
affordable
price
and
acquisition
be
dangerous
for
corporate
culture
by
one
estimate
percent
of
them

against
all
odds
don
t
meet
the
target
set
when
do
i
don
t
find
that
surprising
deal
al
way
look
easy
on
paper
than
they
turn
out
to
be
in
the
real
world
which
have
real
people
institution
emotion
and
history
so
i
ve
try
to
resist
the
temptation
of
acquisition
and
in
this
i
ve
succeed

none

then
these

drove

to

of

that
turn
it
into
the
king
of

television

have
look
at

and
decide
not
to
buy
it
during
the
planning
of
these
deal
there
be
a
buzz
on
the
fifth
floor
of
nokia
s
headquarters
where
the
top
management
have
their
office
i
didn
t
have
anything
to
do
either
with
the
calculation
or
with
make
the
decision
i
kept
to
myself
the
thought
that
the
market
for
television
be
quite
unknown
to
nokia
and
that
it
be
full
of
pitfall
the

of

be
announce
in
the
middle
of

be
a
major
deal

there
be
more
to
come
all

be

arch
rival
the
swedish
company

over
the
ac
quisition
of

division
the
discussion
reach
their
conclusion
at
the
same
time
as
the
sel
deal
nokia
be
become
a
formidable
player
in
the
european
television
market
and
the
large
computer
firm
in
the
nordic
region
we
held
a
press
conference
in
the
ballroom
of
the

hotel
in

sinki
to
announce

we
be
get

for
that
i
chat
with
my
nokia
colleague
i
be
quite
sure
that
the
journal

would
attack
our
ambitious
strategy
i
be
certain
that
someone
would
ask
how
can
you
be
sure
these
deal
will
ever
succeed
but
this
question
didn
t
come
up
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
that
be
just
as
well
because
it
be
a
question
that
nokia

hadn
t
even
ask
each
other
before

deep
in

he
told
the
nokia
director
accompany
him
exactly
what
he
thought
after
their
day
of
discussion
it
s
dangerous
to
find
ourselves
in

nothing
about

dutch
directness
at
its
sharpest
those
wrong
decision
and
those
manager
silence
cost
nokia
dearly
right
up
until
kari
kairamo
ask
just
once
whether
nokia
could
afford
this
expansion
program
he
ought
to
have
ask
a

my
answer
to

be
clear
nokia

balance
sheet
be
under
strain
on
account
of
these

both
of

if
nokia
be
to
stay
solvent
be
what
i
told
him
kairamo
listen
to
my
explanation
he
look
at
me
through
the
transparent
screen
of
his
large
spectacle
and
go
on
to
the
next
thing
he
be
a
small
man
restless
and
mercurial
who
take
people
on
trust
he
have
a
brilliant
intellect
and
a
compelling
vision
he
have
good
intuition
and
the
ability
to
inspire
people
he
be
a
charismatic
leader
in
the
full
sense
but
he
wasn
t
always
able
to
accept
hard
fact
if
they
challenged
his
own
vision
or
perhaps
he
just
thought
nokia
have
to
go
forward
and
any
problem
could
be
solve
one
at
a
time
or
that
the
company
s
future
growth
would
take
care
of
any
financing
problem
i
m
still
not
quite
sure
what
he
could
have
thought
neither
do
i
know
how
much
he
really
believe
his
plan
could
succeed
although
kairamo
have
add
me
to
the
payroll
i
wasn

not

also
we
be
very
different
people
kairamo
want
everything
to
be

he
be
quite
capable
of
gathering
his

whoever

jorma

and
harri

have
kairamo
left
us
to
take
care
of
this
mess
be
that
just
and
fair
to
us
i
knew
at
once
that
suicide
be
kairamo
s
personal
solution
there
weren
t
any
other
skeleton
in
nokia
s
cupboard
as
the
finance
director
i
be
certain
of
that
everything
would
change
the
follow
day
but
life
have
to
go
on
and
we
have
to
save
what
we
could
of
nokia
after
kairamo
s
suicide
that
would
be
no
easy
than
before
the
last
time
i
met
kairamo
be
at
that
christmas
drink
party
at
my
house
on
the
thursday
even
on
the
saturday
he
have
set
out
alone
for
his
place
in
the
country
and
on
the
sunday
he
have
hang
himself
there
in
the
past
he
have
suffer
from
depression
and
bipolar
disorder
now
he
left
a
sui
cide
note
sign
sick
but
the
situation
at
nokia
have
certainly
influence
his
decision
the
pressure
on
him
be
stack
up
from
every
direction
and
his
troubled
mind
probably
add
to
his
problem
by
invent
other
pressure
out
of
thin
air
i
be
a
different
generation
from
kairamo
and
also
too
serious
and
ear
nest
for
his
inner
circle
i
lack
that
sense
of
fun
and
spontaneity
that
kai
ramo
value
above
all
else
apart
from
intelligence
in
those
close
to
him
so
i
have
no
feeling
other
than
a
great
sense
of
emptiness
when
matti
saarinen

me
the
news
of
kairamo
s
death
besides
i
try
to
push
all
my
feeling
to
one
side

such
an
overwhelm

we
didn

i
would
scarcely
allow
such
inexperienced
individual
to

big
issue
as
we
have
to
a

of

ruthlessly
in

that
the

dramatic
departure
of

to
commit
suicide

the
elephant
in

cruel
fact
that
everyone
knew
but
no
one
would
talk
about

s
role
be
itself
a
daily
reminder
of
it
suicide
be
ultimately
a
private
human
tragedy
the
job
of
a
chair
or
a
chief
executive
be
one
of
the
lonely
the
world
can
offer
i
understood
that
only
when
i
experienced
it
of
course
kairamo
be
pretty
remote
from
most
of
us
in
his
everyday
routine
at
nokia
but
that
didn
t
stop
us
silently
ask
ourselves
question
could
we
have
spot
something
could
we
have
do
something
i
have
often
discuss
the
issue
with
my
colleague
many
of
them
felt
that
the
atmosphere
in
the
company
take
a
turn
for
the
well
somewhere
around
or
by
then
nokia
have
an
entirely
new
management
team
that
wasn
t
so
connect
to
the
kairamo
era
perhaps
the
regeneration
of
nokia
also
demonstrate
the
company
s
strong
internal
culture
a
weaker
company
could
have
lose
its
way
completely
after
the
suicide
of
a
chari
matic
chairman

against
all
odds
the
end
of
the

agenda
in

there

also
plenty
to

ing
those
who
didn
t
make
sell
or
invest
anything
might
thrive
there
but
it
wasn
t
regard
as
a
particularly
excite
place
when
i
become
the
finance
director
i
decide
to
change
thing
i
want
the
people
in
my
department
to
value
their
work
and
i
want
the
best
po
sible
people
to
come
and
work
there
and
later
i
try
to
help
them
take
their
career
forward
at
nokia
and
in
the
world
beyond
at
citibank
i
have
man
age
a
few
group
of
finance
specialist
before
that
i
have
have
no

to
speak
of
the

department
be
my
first
real
manage

position
twenty
five
people
answer
to
me
after
my
time
in
nokia
s
finance
department
i
be
in
charge
of
people
and
six
year
after
that
i
be
responsible
for
leadership
be
largely
a
matter
of
communication
and
the
method
and
channel
one
us
depend
very
much
on
the
number
of
people
you
re
man
age
if
you
have
lot
of
subordinate
you
have
to
consider
how
you
can
be
certain
of
get
your
message
across
to
the
whole
organization
in
the
finance
department
i
could
tell
everyone
directly
what
be
on
my
mind
and
they
could
give
me
feedback
directly
you
can
t
do
that
with
people
so
communication
must
be
clear
and
carefully
plan
this
be
the
ceo
s
most
important
task
communication
communication
communication
the
sec
ond
important
task
be
personnel
policy
the
ceo
be
always
a
company
s
most
senior
personnel
manager
these
two
matter
cannot
be
delegate
to
anyone
it
be
with
these
two
matter
that
i
want
to
begin
as
nokia
s
finance
director
i
explain
to
people
that
much
would
be
expect
from
them
but
also
that
good
result
would
be
reward
i
put
new
people
in
new
position
many
of
my
appointment
come
as
a
surprise
and
cause
a
great
deal
of
discussion
within
the
company
i
begin
to
spring
these
surprise
in
nokia
s
finance
department
then
in
nokia
mobile
phone
and
i
have
follow
the
same
policy
as
head
of
nokia
i
enjoy
both
the
surprise
and
the
discussion
they
cause
i
seriously
believe
that
an
organization
need
a
regular
shake
up
in
order
to
stay
fresh
and
lively
one
should
give
lot
of
responsibility
and
power
to
good
people
perhaps
three
time
more
than
they
could
imagine
in
their
wild
dream
people
who
be
try
their
best
shouldn
t
be
punish
for
the
odd
mi
take
but
they
must
learn
from
every
mistake
they
make
every
failure
or
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
error
be
a
formidable
packet
of
information
that
the
company
should
be
able
to
profit
from
not
everyone
be
fond
of
my
habit
of
regularly
turn
the
or
ganization
upside
down
for
me
though
it
s
an
instrument
of
leadership
it
offer
a
mean
for
as
many
people
as
possible
to
use
as
many
of
their
skill
as
possible
and
to
learn
many
new
one
new
task
should
be
genuinely
new
individual
learn
process
enrich
the
whole
company
but
they
enrich
the
individual
themselves
even
more
i
didn
t
know
all
this
when
i
become
finance
director
much
of
it
i
learn
only
much
later
i
have
also
sometimes
make
mistake
when
recruiting
peo
ple
and
appoint
them
to
new
position
but
i
ve
try
to
learn
from
that
in
the
finance
department
i
want
to
extract
from
people
as
much
energy
for
nokia
as
i
could
because
we
need
to
save
money
i
couldn
t
take
on
many
new
people
but
i
concoct
other
way
of
make
us
more
effective
i
decide
to
offer
everyone
in
the
department
a
home
computer
paid
for
by
the
firm
in
this
way
we
be
no
longer
tie
to
normal
work
hour
parent
who
want
to
leave
early
to
look
after
their
child
could
work
later
at
home
in
those
day
the
concept
of
remote
work
have
hardly
be
invent
so
our
department
be
truly
ahead
of
its
time
i
start
to
transform
nokia
s
financial
management
in
other
respect
to
gether
with
my
fellow
director
kari
haavisto
i
persuade
nokia
to
adopt
international
accounting
standard
the
ia
at
that
time
this
be
an
object
of
wonder
and
we
frequently
found
ourselves
justify
it
to
our
colleague
we
have
agree
that
from
that
moment
nokia
would
really
be
an
interna
tional
company
we
have
to
comply
with
international
accounting
standard
if
international
investor
be
to
read
our
account
and
compare
them
with
those
of
other
firm
the
old
guard
have
a
fit
of
the
horror
but
kari
kairamo
be
enthusiastic
about
it
by
some
inexplicable
instinct
he
always
chose
the
international
alternative
if
one
be
open
to
nokia
i
have
never
have
any
time
for
conservative
people
they
dwell
in
the
bu
reaucracies
and
on
the
board
of
many
a
major
enterprise
they
believe
that
every
little
change
threatens
the
entire
heritage
of
the
firm
or
perhaps
more
to
the
point
their
own
desire
for
a
comfortable
life
indeed
they
often
or
ganize
thing
so
that
the
company
serf
them
rather
well
than
they
serve
it
meeting
such
people
can
easily
throw
me
into
a
rage
they
simply
can
t
comprehend
that
if
the
company
do
something
new
it
learns
something
new
as
well
after
that
every
new
thing
becomes
a
little
easy
every
com
pany
have
its
share
of
these
intransigent
people
who
do
all
they
can
to
pre
vent
every
change
or
reform
but
by
adopt
the
international
accounting
standard
nokia
move
up
a
league
and
also
learn
to
think
in
a
new
way

against
all
odds
i
set
other
reform
in
motion
which
rapidly
brought
financial
result
nokia
s
old
system
have
channel
money
to
all
the
bank
nokia
dealt
with
as
a
former
banker
i
decide
to
make
the
bank
compete
for
our
custom
and
so
save
money
for
nokia
we
create
a
system
of
strict
financial
control
whereby
the
different
part
of
the
company
have
to
take
instruction
from
the
head
office
in
this
way
we
prevent
nokia
from
repeat
the
foreign
exchange
loss
it
have
suffer
in
the
early
s
when
the
dollar
collapse
we
establish
a
finance
company
in
geneva
whose
function
be
to
con
trol
all
nokia
cash
stream
this
be
a
new
idea
that
reduce
the
power
of
nokia
s
business
unit
but
also
make
thing
simpler
it
be
just
the
sort
of
idea
worth
push
forward
when
reorganize
a
company
so
of
course
it
too
met
with
vigorous
opposition
the
business
unit
thought
that
nokia
s
head
office
be
grab
power
they
would
no
longer
be
able
to
lend
or
invest
their
own
money
freely
but
it
be
exactly
this
freedom
that
have
cost
nokia
so
dearly
in
payment
to
its
banker
i
want
to
restrict
that
free
dom
and
keep
the
money
for
nokia
we
thought
our
plan
through
very
thoroughly
again
with
kari
kairamo
s
support
before
we
move
the
entire
company
s
financial
management
to
geneva
at
the
same
time
we
focus
our
banking
relationship
on
our
main
bank
er
and
we
adopt
the
net
principle
the
net
effect
of
each
foreign
exchange
transaction
be
take
into
account
in
this
way
we
no
longer
have
to
pay
the
bank
interest
on
account
that
be
in
the
red
if
on
the
same
day
another
account
be
in
the
black
all
nokia
s
cash
transaction
be
simplify
and
focus
in
the
finance
department
we
be
building
a
new
nokia
interna
tional
well
run
clear
in
its
report
to
international
investor
new
way
of
do
thing
call
for
new
people
to
do
them
i
churn
through
staff
in
the
finance
department
rather
fast
because
i
want
the
most
talented
people
little
by
little
i
succeed
in
my
goal
when
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
come
to
us
other

be
not

behind
i
want
my

to
continue
their
trajectory
way
beyond
my

when
i

transfer
to
a

be
promote
to
be

director
the
role
fit
him
like
a

i
constantly
preach
to
people
in
the
finance
department
about
lifelong
learn
new
challenge
and
new
opportunity
in
nokia
pii
kotilainen
be
an
excellent
example
she
have
join
us
a
couple
of
year
earlier
when
she
be
about
twenty
five
year
old
to
work
as
a
corporate
dealer
rather
grandiosely
i
call
her
cubicle
our
deal
room
there
might
have
be
a
couple
of
people
work
with
her
but
it
be
our
nerve
center
where
we
learn
the
business
of
the
money
market
for
me
it
be
an
important
place
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
because
of
my
background
in
banking
i
have
learn
to
follow
the
market
and
i
get
energy
from
their
rapid
movement
i
would
disturb
the
work
of
the
corporate
dealer
by
phone
them
and
ask
question
which
they
would
painfully
attempt
to
answer
pii
be
one
of
them
she
told
me
later
that
i
always
rang
when
she
be
least
ready
to
respond
to
anything
when
pii
have
work
eight
year
in
the
finance
department
i
summon
her
to
the
ceo
s
office
she
must
have
thought
that
nokia
s
foreign
exchange
position
have
collapse
that
her
trade
have
fail
or
that
the
final
reckon
ing
be
due
for
some
other
reason
she
couldn
t
have
be
more
wrong
when
she
sat
down
on
the
dark
brown
sofa
i
ask
her
how
much
longer
she
intend
to
spend
in
the
finance
department
i
propose
that
she
might
become
the
head
of
training
for
the
whole
of
nokia
her
look
of
amaze
ment
be
truly
worth
see
she
didn
t
have
a
single
day
s
experience
of
personnel
matter
but
she
be
a
brilliant
example
of
the
ability
to
learn
new
thing
she
be
one
of
many
who
move
from
the
finance
department
to
other
work
and
new
challenge
that
be
my
goal
and
i
be
happy
when
i
could
achieve
my
goal

even
within

i
also
have
to
concentrate
on
the

the

at

have
told
the
world
that
factory
would
play
no
part
in
my
future
as
a
student
i
have
spent
one
summer
in
a
factory
but
since
then
about
twenty
year
have
pass
during
which
i
have
have
nothing
to
do
with
industrial
production
but
now
i
be
as
involve
as
it
be
possible
to
be
i
be
a
thirty
nine
year
old
charter
engineer
an
economist
a
banker
and
a
former
finance
director
who
now
have
to
learn
how
to
run
product
develop
ment
manufacturing
and
marketing
and
if
i
didn
t
learn
there
wouldn
t
be
much
of
a
future
for
me
at
nokia
i
encounter
considerable
suspicion
about
the
motif
of
nokia
s
top
management
it
didn
t
reveal
itself
directly
no
one
say
anything
there
be
no
sign
of
rebellion
it
be
more
dangerous
than
that
it
take
the
form
of
a
deep
and
icy
silence
finnish
silence
be
famous
perhaps
notorious
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
but
this
go
far
beyond
our
famed
reticence
when
i
go
for
the
first
time
to
address
the
employee
at
the
plant
you
could
have
heard
a
feather
drop
they
star
at
the
floor
they
didn
t
ask
any
question
or
offer
any
comment
but
their
fear
be
so
palpable
and
real
and
so
dense
and
over
whelm
that
i
felt
the
factory
could
collapse
into
nothing
like
a
star
fall
in
upon
itself
to
form
a
black
hole
i
have
call
a
meeting
in
the
large
room
i
could
find
i
talk
talk
talk
and
talk
some
more
i
use
every
positive
word
i
honestly
could
i
told
them
this
outfit
would
be
knock
into
shape
and
make
to
grow
i
be
open
about
nokia
s
failing
and
admit
that
the
company
have
handle
this
area
of
its
operation
badly
no
one
deserves
to
have
four
boss
in
three
year
i
say
all
this
do
little
to
reassure
the
employee
my
employee
i
kept
on
talk
in
the
midst
of
a
dismal
silence
from
this
day
on
there
be
the
prospect
of
growth
and
an
attractive
future
now
we
must
roll
up
our
sleeve
and
get
down
to
work
i
conclude
my
speech
i
believe
what
i
have
told
my
employee
but
i
couldn
t
promise
anything
it
could
all
turn
sourer
still
motorola
might
take
over
what
be
left
of
the
market
a
shortage
of
part
might
cause
our
production
to
collapse
or
marketing
mistake
could
kill
us
nokia
could
decide
to
stop
throw
good
money
after
bad
and
if
anyone
knew
the
state
of
nokia

it
be
the

former

i
sigh
from
the
bottom
of

the

it
certainly
didn

nokia

personage
these
in

would

about

work
that
didn
t
demand
much
attention
there
be
nothing
dramatic
about
it
and
you
be
hardly
likely
to
get
the
press
interested
in
a
rearrangement
of
the
production
line
or
the

of

business
editor
glaze
over
if
you
try
to
talk
to
them
about
the
detail
of

they
didn
t
want
to
understand
nor
be
consumer
interested
in
how
their
phone
be
manufacture
as
long
as
they
work
and
if
the
phone
didn
t
work
it

or
the
market
ing
chief
who
get
it
in
the
neck
not
the
production
manager
i
start
by
reading
as
i
always
do
i
read
book
report
description
of
process
i
read
at
home
in
the
even
in
the
office
in
the
morning
and
on
sunday
night
in
nokia
s
helsinki
headquarters
in
salo
at
the
fac
tory
i
call
markku
alasaari
the
production
manager
to
my
room
i
ask
him
to
explain
how
the
factory
work
how
mobile
phone
be
make
after
that
i
ask
all
the
key
production
people
to
talk
me
through
the
same
thing
one
by
one
i
try
to
ask
simple
question
i
learn
about
the
role
of
material
resource
planning
in
production
about
operation
management
i
learn
what
impact
a
certain
machine
make
by
panasonic
would
have
on
our
production
line
and
i
still
understand
it
today
i
want
to
learn
the
language
that
production
people
spoke
it
help
that
i
have
an
excellent
memory
which
would
be
extremely
useful
later
on
as
well
i
find
it
easy
to
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
remember
number
name
abbreviation
everything
in
fact
whether
i
need
to
or
not
perhaps
the
most
difficult
issue
which
i
have
to
address
pretty
much
as
soon
as
i
start
the
job
be
to
introduce
a
three
shift
system
at
salo
in
all
the
work
be
still
carry
out
in
a
single
shift
and
move
to
a
shift
system
arouse
fierce
opposition
i
ran
the
project
personally
markku
alasaari
held
meeting
where
we
be
clear
about
what
we
be
do
and
why
our
competitor
such
as
motorola
already
operate
a
shift
system
at
their
most
productive
factory
we
have
to
work
more
efficiently
too
i
held
frequent
and
informal
meeting
with
the
supervisor
and
trade
union
repre
sentatives
through
patient
discussion
we
brought
about
a
complete
change
in
less
than
half
a
year
production
be
important
in
salo
because
we
have
to
bring
our
good
to
market
quickly
preferably
accord
to
a
clear
timetable
and
faster
than
our
competitor
we
also
have
to
design
phone
that
we
could
be
confident
we
could
actually
make
our
product
development
have
risen
to
the
challenge
pose
by
motorola
we
developed
a
model
with
feature
that
would
ensure
that
we
would
beat
our
american
competitor
it
be
an
excellent
piece
of
work
but
we
couldn
t
make
it
efficiently
or
profitably
my
most
important
job
now
be
to
ensure
that
the
demand
of
production
be
factor
in
at
the
planning
stage
product
development
have
always
be
one
of
nokia
s
strength
nokia
en
gineers
be
always
proud
of
their
ability
to
develop
new
idea
and
apply
them
without
preconception
there
have
always
be
a
dash
of
madness
in
nokia
s
gene
we
believe
that
we
could
do
thing
if
other
people
could
do
them
this
have
never
be
too
big
a
challenge
for
nokia
but
for
some
reason
it
be
just
this
characteristic
that
get
us
completely
bogged
down
at
the
fac
tory
when
motorola
announce
its
new
model
nokia
s
engineer
be
all
over
the
place
we
try
to
respond
in
half
a
year
but
our
production
line
weren
t
up
to
it
and
we
sank
even
deeper
into
a
quagmire
not
all
motorola
s
product
be
successful
but
they
be
successful
enough
to
drive
us
to
the
brink
of
panic
the
production
people
be
always
the
low
caste
in
a
thrive
company
and
at
nokia
they
be
often
regard
as
fail
product
developer
so
when
senior
management
start
to
take
production
seri
ously
the
impact
be
immediate
i
go
on
to
the
shop
floor
once
a
month
and
the
production
line
be
stop
i
gather
the
employee
together
to
listen
and
try
to
explain
as
openly
as
i
could
how
thing
be
go
both
in
the
company
as
a
whole
and
at
salo
i
listen
to
their
complaint
and
consider
their
suggestion
i

against
all
odds
kept
up
my
factory
visit
even
when
i
become
ceo
and
then
chairman
the
key
thing
be
to
develop
relationship
of
trust
with
the
local
shop
steward
lilja
laakso
the
chief
shop
steward
at
the
salo
plant
be
especially
sup
portive
her
rigorous
but
reasonable
approach
solve
many
problem
as
the
factory
grow
and
change
be
set
in
motion

good
liisa
my
wife
regret
that
nokia

more
of
my
time
but
we
raise
a
glass
of
cham
pagne
to
each
other
to
mark
the
big
day
it
seem
to
me
that
i
be
a
success
in
my
new
job

have
regain
their
self
confidence

in
good
shape
prod

be
march
in
step
i
have
be
drive
to
salo
several
day
a
week
and
during
the
journey
i
have
time
to
think
of
everything
i
could
possibly
do
to
make
thing
run
well
there
i
must
have
seem
enviably
almost
absurdly
fit
and
i
make
my
staff
feel
guilty
by
adver
tising
that
i
played
tennis
at
seven
in
the

and
a

but
he
knew
how
to
run
a
plant
to
best
effect
another
major
leap
be
our
move
to
the
english
language
when
we
bought
the
british
company
technophone
our
middle
manager
have
have
to
learn
a
new
language
and
a
new
culture
in
a
small
town
factory
this
be
a
major
change
even
if
the
market
have
always
be
international
we
pre
par
our
presentation
in
english
we
practice
think
in
english
and
we
try
to
work
out
what
our
english
speak
customer
be
think
in
salo
the
meeting
held
by
my
predecessor
have
be
very
long
manag
er
have
spent
day
agonize
over
strategy
i
want
an
orderly
and
efficient
management
group
whose
member
be
keen
to
take
personal
responsibil
ity
for
the
area
they
ran
i
want
to
put
the
right
people
in
the
right
place
in
addition
to
production
i
want
to
focus
on
personnel
for
the
important
job
i
look
for
people
who
radiate
a
quiet
charisma
by
that
i
don
t
mean
brashness
bumptiousness
or
self
centeredness
but
some
intangible
quality
that
will
win
people
over
without
their
notice
it
and
this
quality
include
a
strong
work
ethic
a
vision
and
an
ability
to
think
there
be
very
few
european
company
where
young
and
inexperi
enced
manager
could
rise
so
quickly
to
position
of
responsibility
nokia
in
the
s
be
one
of
these
our
employee
in
finland
developed
a
healthy
self
respect
i
use
an
overhead
projector
to
show
a
slide
to
our
manage
ment
group
compare
us
to
motorola
and
announce
that
in
the
future
we
would
be
dynamic
champion
we
would
beat
motorola
we
start
to
speak
openly
about
our
strategy
and
objective
i
want
every
single
one
of
our
worker
to
understand
what
these
be
we
didn
t
delude
ourselves
that
each
and
every
worker
would
become
a
true
believer
in
our
objective
sometimes
i
wasn
t
even
sure
myself
where
we
might
end
up
but
fortunately
thing
start
to
happen
we
be
bring
product
to
market
that
would
at
last
make
us
a
serious
challenger
the
first
of
these
be
the
mobile
phone
nokia

against
all
odds
chapter
the
miracle
of
the
mobile
i
n
our
big
problem
be
to
create
a
phone
that
would
enable
us
to
increase
our
market
share
globally
we
want
a
mobile
phone
that
would
be
light
functional
and
that
you
could
take
anywhere
and
if
it
look
good
and
be
easy
to
use
then
so
much
the
well
at
the
begin
of
the
year
we
didn
t
have
such
a
phone
but
we
would
need
to
have
a
new
phone
on
the
market
by
the
follow
january
if
we
intend
to
survive
everyone
knew
the
company
would
stand
or
fall
by
the
success
or
failure
of
its
new
phone
a
new
and
wonderful
product
doesn
t
spring
into
be
overnight
or
even
over
the
course
of
twelve
month
behind
its
development
design
and
test
ing
lie
many
year
and
many
people
those
people
must
have
dedicate
their
life
to
product
development
technology
and
innovation
for
this
they
need
the
right
sort
of
education
to
transform
raw
talent
into
ability
fortunately
finland
have
the
right
sort
of
people
with
a
good
basic
technical
education
genius
be
the
property
of
individual
of
course
but
it
show
itself
best
in
a
group
that
must
meet
a
formidable
challenge
in
a
give
time
the
story
of
our
new
phone
be
an
example
of
this
but
to
understand
its
development
it
s
necessary
to
go
back
in
time
to
its
begin
over
forty
year
and
to

never

for

of

told
him
that
he
have
thought
the
problem
in
question
be
insoluble
korhonen
s
solution
be
take
into

stayed
there
for
over
ten

of
the

put
on
ice
for
the
moment
but
pertti
korhonen
seem
to
take
that
in
his
stride
later
he
told
me
he
design
a
phone
in
secret
and
on
his
own
time
after
the
order
have
come
to
suspend
work
nothing
would
hold
korhonen
back
his
goal
be
to
make
the
light
mobile
phone
possible
he
also
want
to
double
the
length
of
time
it
could
be
use
once
again
his
engineer
say
it
be
an
impossible
challenge
he
put
the
circuit
diagram
for
nokia
s
current
model
the
cityman
under
the
microscope
and
reach
the
only
possible
conclusion
the
number
of
component
have
to
be
halve
the
engineer
tore
their
hair
out
and
declare
that
korhonen
be
mad
but
one
summer
night
korhonen
and
his
team
have
an
inspiration
they
suddenly
realize
how
the
phone
need
to
be
design
in
order
to
meet
all
the
requirement
it
be
like
a
religious
experi
ence

few
year
later
korhonen
receive
a
souvenir
from
the

cause

developed
in
the
middle
of
a
crisis
in
the

in
the
past
we
have
manage
to
sell

and
the
cityman

among
our
suc

but
we
hadn

gotten
very
far
with
cheaper
model
our

be
aim
at
just
a
few
market
segment
we
be
still
not
a
global
operator
but
now
we
have
to
become
one
motorola

bring
down
its

where
nokia
should
have
be
dominant
the
market
and
business
activity
in
general
be
in
such
a
state
of
crisis
that
nokia
s
future
be
in
danger
nokia
might
well
have
be
a
footnote
in
history
a
company
that
make
mobile
phone
for
a
brief
moment
before
shrink
and
die
we
all
understood
this
if
only
subconsciously
and
it
give
us
the
strength
to
go
on
living
on
the
edge
microcircuit
or
technical
property
be
not
enough
to
ensure
the
suc

also
need
to
look
good
to
be

brilliantly
and
to
be
what
the
customer
want
for
the

we
be
create
a
product
that
would
be
bought
by
individual
all
over
the
world
so
we
have
to
find
out
quickly

react
to
a
family
of
product
with
different
model
for
consumer
and
for
business
use
be
our
product
development
fast
enough
to
respond
to
the
hope
and
expectation
that
our
customer
research

that
while
we

design
our
phone
our
competitor
have
change
the
antenna
of
their
phone
now
they
be
retractable
rather
than
built
into
the

of
the

we
make
a
rapid
shift
which
must
have
give
our
engineer
grey
hair
but
our
new
phone
get
its
retractable
antenna
because
that
be
what
the
consumer
seem
to
want
for
the
first
time
our
product
development
process
have
respond
to

come
directly
from
the

we
developed
a
six
stage

at
each
stage
we
assess
how

m
not
a
natural
product
development
engineer
on
my
own
i
m
not
particularly
creative
but
i
try
to
bring
creativity
into
organization
and
to
provide
opportunity
for
people
who
be
creative
nor
be
i
espe
cially
skilled
at
marketing
so
i
decide
i
would
also
leave
that
to
the
expert
kari
pekka
wilska
head
of
sale
and
marketing
look
after
all
the
market
ing
activity
around
the
world
well
than
anyone
but
we
need
some
fresh
energy
as
well
if
we
be
to
turn
nokia
into
a
global
brand
in
autumn
i
invite
three
of
the
most
important
member
of
my
staff
to
a
meeting
our
organization
need
more
oomph
we
need
to
renew
ourselves
to
internationalize
and
to
generate
some
fresh
idea
i
told
the
three
men
that
i
hop
they
would
take
on
staff
more
intelligent
than
them
self
these
new
manager
might
come
from
within
nokia
but
it
would
be
well
if
they
be
recruit
externally
make
sure
that
they
re
well
than
you
at
one
thing
at
the
very
least
well
still
at
two
i
say
and
look
at
the
startle
manager
two
of
them
do
start
an
enthusiastic
hunt
for
people
smarter
than
themselves
that
be
how
we
found
anssi
vanjoki
who
come

he
have
a
brilliant
knack
for
bring
together
the
rational
and
the
emotional
side
of
marketing
he
have
an
ana
lytical
mind
but
he
also
understood
what
might
entice
a
customer
to
buy
our
product
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
for
some
reason
most
of

successful
manager
come
from
finland

small
town
and
many
from

however
he

keting
into
shape
but
his
great
contribution
lay
in
building
nokia
as
a
brand
i
ask
him
to
arrange
a
branding
afternoon
a
brainstorming
session
to
discus
how
nokia
might
be
built
up
as
a
brand
this
fire
him
up
at
once
this
be
one
of
the
area
where
he
be
expert
and
one
where
he
have
self
confidence
which
in
later
year
we
really
come
to
appreciate
anssi
have
become
interested
in
brand
as
a
student
he
have
study
mercedes
benz
marlboro
and
nike
and
their
history
as
brand
each
be
the
leader
in

against
all
odds
its
field
finland
didn
t
have
a
single
internationally
recognize
brand
to
its
name
with
the
possible
exception
of
marimekko
but
even
marimekko
be
know
only
to
a
few
select
group
of
discern
consumer
finnish
industry
be
focus
on
the
production
of
capital
good
in
tend
not
for
individual
consumer
but
for
business
indeed
one
lead
finnish
industrialist
say
that
in
finland
it
wasn
t
worth
produce
anything
small
than
a
horse
or
that
couldn
t
be
bolt
to
the
floor
paper
make
machinery
certainly
met
these
criterion
mobile
phone
on
the
other
hand
do
not
even
so
we
be
convince
it
be
worth
give
phone
a
go
and
if
we
didn
t
succeed
in
create
a
strong
brand
there
be
no
future
for
us
in
the
world
market
at
our
branding
afternoon
anssi
vanjoki
explain
that
it
would
be
well
for
nokia
to
focus
on
a
single
brand
name
rather
than
the
plethora
of
trade
mark
then
in
use
some
people
thought
the
only
hope
for
nokia
would
be
to
design
and
manufacture
mobile
phone
as
a
sub
contractor
to
other
manufacturer
nokia
didn
t
have
what
it
take
to
create
its
own
brand
that
would
have
be
the
easy
way
out
surprisingly
many
people
at
nokia
want
ed
to
take
it
if
we
have
nokia
would
have
ultimately
become
the
same
sort
of
manufacturer
as
many
chinese
and
taiwanese
firm
be
today
they
make
product
anonymously
for
nokia
and
other
brand
the
people
at
that
meeting
sat
on
the
edge
of
their
seat
as
anssi
ran
through
his
presentation
many
be
gripped
by
dread
they
thought
ollila
and
vanjoki
must
be
mad
nokia
which
have
only
recently
emerge
from
the
finnish
forest
could
surely
never
become
something
that
one
might
men
tion
in
the
same
breath
as
mercedes
benz
but
in
true
finnish
style
those
dissident
be
silent
and
wait
to
see
how
we
would
stumble
in
imple
menting
our
megalomaniac
idea
after
our
seminar
i
ask
anssi
vanjoki
to
develop
nokia
s
first
brand
strategy
he
also
open
tender
discussion
with
international
advertis
ing
agency
we
decide
that
from
now
on
our
brand
would
be
simply
nokia
the
only
exception
would
be
the
british
mobile
phone
company
technophone
which
we
have
bought
but
apart
from
that
we
would
use
no
name
other
than
nokia
anssi
argue
forcefully
for
this
decision
when
it
have
be
make
an
ssi
become
the
key
strategist
of
the
nokia
brand
which
have
five
dimension
high
technology
nordic
touch
individuality
freedom
and
last
quality
but
what
should
the
new
phone
look
like
what
shape
should
it
be
what
sort
of
phone
would
customer
be
eager
to
buy
could
a
mobile
phone
be
some
color
other
than
black
we
found
ourselves
in
a
world
where
every
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
thing
be
possible
but
where
we
didn
t
know
what
would
work
fortunately
we
found
frank

the
designer
frank

work
for

frank

after
that
there
would
be
many
more
we
take
design
seriously
we
believe
that
a
phone
s
external
appearance
and
the
user
s
experience
of
use
it
would
be
critical
in
the
consumer
market
the
finn

a
good
sense
of
design
we
be
know
for
our
architecture
our
glassware
marimekko
textile
and
other
classic
of

design
we
tend
to
take

seriously
both
as
a
matter
of
natural
professionalism
and
because
it
have
brought

we

come
up

something
new
we

the
idea
that

his
idea

pretty
good
he

now
that

our
marketing
people
have
quite
an
argument
about
the
color
to

point

gather
up

ask
juha
pinomaa
to
choose
just
a
few
example
for
the
next
meeting
which
would
take
place
in
helsinki
in
the
summer
there
the
discussion
continued
many
customer
have
say
they
would
like
a
white

fortunately
we
be
on
our
guard
white
phone
have
already
ap
peared
in
the
shop
but
customer
hadn
t
bought
them
we
want
more
woman
customer
but
a
white
phone
combine
with
lipstick
stain
wasn
t
really
part
of
our
design
finally
anssi
vanjoki
our
master
of

decide
that
our
new

would
be
make
available
in
two
color
green
and
grey
the
back
of
the
phone
would
always
be
charcoal
gray
so
all
our
phone
could
be
switch
between
two
color
by
remove
one
color
case
and
replace
it
with
the
other
a
new
era
have
begin
the
mobile
phone
be
black
no
more
the
customer
could
choose
the
mobile
phone
be
no
longer
merely
a
dull
utensil
but
a
way
to
show
your
individuality
and
to
send
out
message
about
yourself
after
this
nothing

however
at

nonetheless
it
practically
jumped
off

for
many

these
have
have
a
quality
mark
a
little
sticker
that
say
pass
our
marketing
people
wonder
what
we
might
be
able
to
come
up
with
we
briefly
consider
the
word
suomi
finland
but
at
that
time
the
signal
it
sent
out
seem
more
negative
than
positive
so
we
decide
to
stick
a
little
label
with
nordic
on
it
on
to
our
phone
because
nordic
value
seem
good
they
embody
clarity
naturalness
good
design
but
we
quickly
real
ized
that
the
nordic
sticker
didn
t
do
much
to
improve
our
sale
or
our
brand
let
alone
help
us
create
an
identity
we
be
ready
to
stand
on
our
own
two
foot
as
simply
nokia
we
have
a
very
simple
goal
for
our
television
advertising
we
want
the
viewer
to
think
nokia
whenever
there
be
any

we
ran
a
campaign
show

after

life
before

really
grim
a
despondent
figure
reminiscent
of

of

in

to
get
rid

the

many
of
my
key
executive
though
they
didn
t
interview
me
the
result
be
a
very
broadly
base
report
a
great
pile
of
useless
paper
work
to
be
frank
the
consultant
affirm
that
mobile
phone
be
a
prom

nokia
didn

adequate
this
wasn

of

generally
dire
the

not
hope
to
succeed
globally
in
any
of
the

where
it
be

this

the

i
don

more
than
that
about

what

it
can

of
and
we
decide
to
announce
it
on
january
at
nokia
s
helsinki
headquarters
we
invite
about
ten
economic
journalist
from
finnish
newspaper
our
publicity
department
have
work
far
into
the
night
and
have
come
up
with
an
inspire
idea
they
have
make
little
cardboard
mock
ups
of
the
new
phone
and
popped
them
into
enve
lope
the
bemuse
journalist
each
have
in
front
of
them
a
cup
of
coffee
a
bun
and
an
envelope
when
i
told
them
they
could
the
journalist
open
the
packet
and
saw
for
themselves
that
a
phone
could
fit
inside
an
envelope
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
we
make
the
impression
we
want
the
journalist
be
amaze
even
if
they
d
have
found
it
difficult
to
make
a
call
on
a
cardboard
phone
the
original
come
in
just
two
color
graphite
gray
and
green
its
but
ton
didn
t
twinkle
in
the
dark
like
the
light
of
la
vega
it
didn
t
have
a
radio
thermometer
or
camera
but
it
be
an
effective
and
reliable
mobile
phone
that
sell
well
everywhere
it
weigh
just
ounce
which
make
it
the
light
you
could
buy
its
battery
be
the
best
available
and
the
lon
gest
last
and
it
look
good
without
it
we
would
never
have
achieve
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
our
great
success
later
in
the
s
the
be
the
model
t
ford
of
our
time
it
take
mobile
phone
production
out
of
the
workshop
and
into
the
fac
tory
it
be
a
mobile
phone
that
we
could
churn
out
in
vast
quantity
and
so
gain
the
advantage
of
mass
production
and
it
give
a
foretaste
of
nokia
s
design
language
i
do
well
at
the
press
conference
i
have
all
the
fact
and
detail
at
my
fin
gertips
as
i
usually
do
fortunately
none
of
the
journalist
ask
aggressive
question
about
nokia
s
future
leadership
at
that
press
conference
i
knew
that
six
day
later
my
appointment
as
chief
executive
would
be
announce
so
my
head
be
already
spin
with
all
sort
of
issue
above
and
beyond
the
launch
of
the
late
mobile
a
couple
of
day
before
the
press
conference
i
have
jot
down
on
a
couple
of
sheet
of
paper
my
idea
on
how
we
could
save
nokia
the
plan
be
audacious
very
short
and
should
the
bad
hap
pen
wrong
but
i
believe
in
it
completely
nokia
have
drift
into
ever
more
troubled
water
for
the
whole
of
the
year
just
go
by
the
bank
have
turn
off
the
tap
as
far
as
far
credit
be
concerned
and
revoke
their
exist
credit
limit
the
finance
director
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
have
travel
the
world
to
get
more
capital
wherever
it
be
to
be
have
but
every
time
he
come
back
to
finland
he
be
grayer
and
more
depressed
after
the
helsinki
press
conference
i
flew
to
stockholm
to
talk
about
our
new
model
there
the
swedish
journalist
be
aggressive
in
their
usual
way
they
ask
why
nokia
want
to
launch
an
old
fashion
nmt
phone
when
ericsson
s
forthcoming
model
would
use
the
new
gsm
technology
this
grill
ing
didn
t
feel
good
for
i
sense
an
undercurrent
of
finnish
swedish
rivalry
somehow
i
get
through
the
press
conference
but
it
be
an
uncomfort
able
experience
the
fact
be
that
ericsson
be
far
too
early
in
try
to
ex
ploit
the
new
technology
nokia
sell
its
old
fashion
phone
at
least
until
model
kept
our
factory
go
through
our
darkest
year
and
i
learn
that
you
should
never
offer
people
new
technology
before
they
re
ready
for
it
it
s
not
worth
it
you
can
t
teach
your
customer
what
you
have
to
do
be
listen
to
them
very
carefully
i
understood
though
that
we
have
to
be
in
a
position
to
launch
a
good
gsm
phone
as
soon
as
we
could
we
have
now
brought
nokia
s
mobile
phone
business
back
into
the
black
after
three
year
of
loss
but
there
be
still
a
long
journey
ahead
before
we
achieve
real
growth
the
be
a
great
help
in
this
and
it
be
a
success
story
for
many
year
this
one
phone
carry
our
entire
business
a
long
way
in
its
share
of
our
total
mobile
phone
sale
be
percent
and
the
fol
low
year
percent
this
one
product
in
its
various
version
be
nokia
s
bread
and
butter
just
then

against
all
odds
one
of
my
last
duty
while
i
be
in
charge
of
the
mobile
phone
division
just
four
day
or
so
before
my
new
appointment
be
announce
be
to
host
a
visit
by
the
local
press
to
the
salo
factory
we
have
arrange
to
give
the
chief
editor
and
other
journalist
a
presentation
on
the
mobile
phone
market
this
would
be
follow
by
drink
a
sauna
and
supper
in
those
day
finn
often
look
after
our
communication
and
marketing
in
the
sauna
and
nokia
be
no
exception
indeed
in
earlier
time
executive
would
often
go
to
the
sauna
during
the
day
but
happily
those
time
be
already
behind
us
on
this
occasion
i
didn
t
have
time
to
linger
in
the
sauna
instead
i
would
set
out
my
thought
on
the
mobile
phone
industry
in
a
series
of
slide
us
ing
an
overhead
projector
but
the
projector
wasn
t
work
because
our
communication
chief
lauri
kivinen
have
forgotten
to
check
it
beforehand
doesn
t
anything
work
around
here
i
shout
at
the
terrify
kivinen
af
ter
that
he
learn
to
check
the
equipment
in
advance
the
local
newspaper
editor
who
happen
to
be
in
the
room
be
a
little
startle
at
my
volcanic
reaction
my
new
duty
be
already
press
down
on
me
nokia
s
board
ask
me
who
should
succeed
me
as
the
manager
of
the
mo
bile
phone
division
i
told
them
that
wasn
t
an
easy
question
and
that
i
would
need
at
least
two
month
to
mull
it
over
i
thought
hard
and
long
until
the
answer
be
clear
to
me
march
pekka
ala
pietil
would
take
charge
of
nokia
s
mobile
phone
operation
pekka
who
be
then
thirty
five
didn
t
really
have
any
experience
of
run
a
major
operation
he
wasn
t
overly
bubbly
or
full
of
himself
his
appointment
be
one
of
my
big
risk
but
i
be
use
to
trust
my
intuition
and
that
now
told
me
that
pekka
could
grow
into
the
job
the
first
six
month
be
difficult
but
after
that
everyone
saw
i
have
be
right
the
choice
be
of
course
a
surprise
some
people
in
the
mobile
phone
group
imagine
they
have
a
right
to
that
job
but
it
be
perhaps
pekka
who
be
the
most
surprised
i
heard
it
in
his
voice
when

an
offer
and
a
reply
i
be
forty
one
happily
married
and
a
father
of
three
i
have
learn
my
own
strength
and
weakness
i
knew
i
could
run
a
company
now
i
have
be
offer
the
role
of
nokia
s
chief
executive
and
i
wouldn
t
get
a
second
chance
like
this
at
nokia
the
company
be
a
catastrophe
there
be
only
two
way
it
could
go
either
it
would
be
knock
into
shape
or
it
would
be
sell
off
bit
by
bit
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
over
a
hundred
year
of
finnish
industrial
history
and
expertise
for
a
year
or
more
before
i
take
over
there
have
be
speculation
that
nokia
might
be
sell
informal
discussion
have
begin
in
march
with
a
view
to
prepare
nokia
for
sale
to
ericsson
the
bank
that
own
most
of
nokia
lead
the
way
but
they
too
be
in
a
bad
way
because
finland
face
the
bad
recession
of
any
western
european
country
in
more
than
forty
year
in
practice
preparation
for
nokia
s
sale
to
ericsson
be
in
the
hand
of
a
small
group
of
corporate
investor
the
man
who
be
behind
it
be
casimir
ehrnrooth
one
of
finland
s
most
influential
industrialist
and
also
a
mem
ber
of
the
nokia
board
of
director
he
be
well
know
to
ericsson
s
swed
ish
owner
and
would
play
an
important
role
at
nokia
in
the
next
few
year
in
spring
it
seem
practically
certain
that
nokia
would
be
sell
to
ericsson
discussion
take
place
in
a
positive
spirit
the
aim
be
to
con
clude
the
matter
by
the
autumn
the
finnish
bank
have
a
great
deal
to
worry
about
at
that
time
and
would
welcome
have
one
of
their
burden
lift
the
tenth
of
october
be
the
deadline
for
ericsson
to
reply
to
the
group
that
have
prepared
the
sale
of
nokia
i
be
told
that
they
gather
in
the
of
fice
of
an
insurance
company
in
the
center
of
helsinki
there
they
wait

against
all
odds
around
the
table
for
the
conference
call
bring
final
confirmation
from
stockholm
but
when
the
call
come
it
brought
bad
news
while
ericsson
have
be
interested
in
nokia
it
have
decide
that
the
consumer
electronics
divi
sion
which
be
lose
money
pose
too
great
a
risk
the
price
be
too
high
to
cover
the
risk
so
ericsson
would
not
buy
nokia
after
all
the
investment
banker
be
first
stun
and
then
deeply
disappointed
ericsson
make
its
decision
for
sound
reason
but
the
company
s
top
man
agement
clearly
didn
t
understand
the
impact
their
decision
would
have
on
the
telecommunication
industry
or
indeed
on
their
own
position
there
s
nothing
unusual
about
that
such
decision
be
often
make
pretty
much
by
chance
and
only
later
be
reason
found
to
justify
them
i
personally
take
no
part
in
these
discussion
since
i
be
still
run
the
mobile
phone
division
in
salo
my
enthusiasm
have
prove
infectious
people
now
try
to
beat
their
previous
achievement
and
our
growth
target
nokia
be
still
a
small
player
in
the
mobile
phone
market
compare
to
say
mo
torola
but
our
fight
spirit
be
on
the
march
fortify
by
our
result
so
far
it
must
have
be
around
late
october
that
discussion
start
on
whether
i
would
be
a
suitable
candidate
for
the
job
of
nokia
s
chief
executive
these
mostly
take
place
in
the
private
din
room
of
yhdyspankki
one
of
fin
land
s
two
big
bank
i
don
t
know
exactly
who
come
up
with
my
name
but
certainly
casimir
ehrnrooth
the
bank
s
chairman
ahti
hirvonen
and
its
senior
banker
bj
rn

involve
later
i
be
told
that
no
other
internal
candidate
be
discuss
my
bos

ceo
simo
vuorilehto
summon
me
to
his
office
one
day
in
november
to
tell
me
i
be
in
the
frame
to
be
nokia
s
new
chief
ex
ecutive
he
be
ready
to
retire
before
his

end
his

with
the

step
down
as

second
in

i
report
this
conversation
to
liisa
her
reaction
be
horror
rather
than
delight
but
she
be
ready
to
support
me
take
on
this
new
role
be
a
per
sonal
risk
when
i
ask
liisa
if
i
should
accept
the
challenge
her
answer
be
clear
of
course
you
should
but
we
both
knew
that
if
thing
go
badly
my
fall
would
be
precipitous
failure
as
nokia
s
chief
executive
would
have
be
a
very
black
mark
at
a
time
when
finland
s
job
market
have
all
but
close
down
thing
go
forward
i
have
a
meeting
with
a
bank
chairman
who
ask
me
what
i
thought
should
be
do
with
nokia
i
told
him
and
he
make
a
note
of
my
thought
on
a
large
notepad
i
also
discuss
my
future
with
per
karlsson
i
have
gotten
to
know
per
well
and
i
trust
his
analytical
ability
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
we
met
in
london
in
mid
december
and
have
an
english
breakfast
at
the
capitol
hotel
which
be
my
favorite
when
i
told
him
that
i
d
be
invite
to
take
over
at
nokia
he
be
stun
well
that
s
something
that
only
happens
once
in
a
lifetime
you
have
to
take
it
of
course
but
you
must
also
discus
thing
very
carefully
with
liisa
per
say
seriously
after
breakfast
i
walk
from
the
hotel
to
my
car
i
have
to
drive
to
camber
ley
where
we
have
a
mobile
phone
factory
as
i
drove
i
thought
that
nobody
would
say
to
me
don
t
take
that
job
i
have
to
take
it
that
s
certainly
what
i
thought
myself
but
i
also
want
to
think
through
all
the
less
appeal
option
there
weren
t
many
people
i
could
discus
these
with
but
the
con
versations
i
do
have
make
me
all
the
more
determine
to
take
the
new
job
there
be
some
skeptical
view
i
discuss
the
offer
with
my
old
friend
pentti
kouri
he
understood
the
state
nokia
be
in
since
he
have
join
the
board
a
year
before
kouri
kick
the
idea
around
and
analyze
nokia
s
situ
ation
and
the
risk
associate
with
become
its
chief
executive
in
a
very
personal
way
be
there
anything
in
this
for
you
be
the
question
that
sum
up
his
view
at
the
end
of
november
i
take
a
call
from
casimir
ehrnrooth
we
have
met
very
briefly
on
a
few
occasion
but
i
couldn
t
really
say
i
knew
him
he
suggest
a
meeting
which
start
a
collaboration
at
nokia
that
last
near
ly
a
decade
ehrnrooth
want
to
know
whether
i
be
interested
in
becom
ing
the
chief
executive
of
nokia
and
what
i
thought
should
be
do
with
the
company
we
met
on
december
in
an
office
overlook
helsinki
s
old
church
there
be
still
no
snow
in
the
churchyard
the
tombstone
of
the
plague
victim
bury
there
appear
as
dark
shadow
against
the
ground
while
the
tree
seem
even
darker
and
more
threaten
the
impression
be
radiant
in
a
way
only
a
deep
finnish
winter
can
be
casimir
ehrnrooth
be
accompany
by
another
board
member
the
chief
executive
of
the
pohjola
insurance
company
yrj
niskanen
my
two
boss
to
be
present
me
officially
with
the
question
be
you
ready
to
accept
the
position
of
chief
executive
of
nokia
when
i
have
officially
answer
that
i
be
our
conversation
begin
in
break
between
drinking
coffee
we
dis
cuss
how
nokia
have
gotten
into
its
current
state
and
what
might
be
do
about
it
we
agree
that
i
would
do
some
serious
think
about
nokia
s
future
i
promise
to
prepare
a
presentation
for
them
in
the
new
year
i
do
have
some
thought
or
rather
one
thought
while
my
discussion
over
the
new
job
be
go
on
i
be
also
work
on
my
vision
with
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
we
sat
around
in
the
new
year
and
draft
a
short
paper

against
all
odds
which
be
extremely
simple
the
message
be
clear
nokia
have
to
focus
on
mobile
phone
telecommunication
and
cable
and
it
have
to
add
value
for
its
shareholder
everything
else
should
follow
from
that
in
practice
this
meant
that
nokia
have
to
move
out
of
many
area
it
be
a
radical
but
simple
idea
such
idea
be
often
the
best
when
i
look
again
at
that
two
page
report
i
be
still
unashamedly
proud
of
it
of
course
i
didn
t
predict
the
entire
future
correctly
some
of
the
de
tail
come
closer
to
reality
than
others
but
i
could
put
something
very
simi
lar
forward
again
with
a
clear
conscience
my
view
be
that
the
company
should
examine
at
once
whether
it
could
sell
off
the
whole
consumer
electronics
operation
if
that
wasn
t
possible
i
put
forward
a
model
for
a
joint
venture
that
would
guarantee
it
could
be
sell
later
cable
manufacture
be
one
of
nokia
s
old
area
of
business
and
very
much
part
of
its
history
nokia
have
make
cable
since
the
s
and
un
til
that
have
be
its
most
profitable
division
it
didn
t
make
a
profit
in
but
at
least
it
brought
in
more
money
than
the
budget
forecast
i
thought
the
cable
business
be
worth
pursue
though
this
turn
out
to
be
a
misjudgment
the
cable
industry
be
languish
across
europe
and
we
sell
the
division
later
in
the
decade
finland
be
sinking
into
an
economic
depression
the
soviet
union
be
crumble
indeed
it
have
formally
cease
to
exist
four
day
before
i
accepted
the
new
job
it
have
be
an
important
trading
partner
for
nokia
a
stable
and
lucrative
source
of
income
the
break
up
have
a
serious
effect
on
the
telecommunication
and
cable
division
in
particular
between
january
and
may
nokia
s
loss
amount
to
around
million
markka
about
million
at
price
only
its
mobile
phone
and
basic
industry
division
be
clearly
make
a
profit
the
loss
have
worsen
from
the
previous
year
and
revenue
be
down
compare
to
both
the
previous
year
and
the
budget
the
figure
confirm
the
impression
that
the
whole
company
be
in
a
tailspin
in
my
report
i
suggest
that
mobile
phone
network
would
be
the
invest
ment
of
the
future
i
didn
t
however
believe
that
nokia
could
go
it
alone
i
thought
that
it
need
to
consider
alliance
with
other
company
on
mo
bile
phone
i
write
the
follow
sentence
which
i
m
still
proud
of
mo
bile
phone
be
a
central
focus
which
there
be
no
reason
even
to
consider
relinquish
at
the
very
least
our
aim
should
be
to
maintain
the
group
s
current
position
globally
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
i
have
myself
be
in
charge
of
the
mobile
phone
division
from
to
and
i
knew
that
we
could
achieve
result
i
knew
the
employee
at
our
salo
development
center
and
plant
be
motivate
and
keen
to
make
a
world
champion
of
nokia
i
didn
t
of
course
know
that
ten
year
after
i
write
that
paper
nokia
would
command
percent
of
the
global
mobile
market
or
indeed
how
big
that
market
would
be
that
could
scarcely
have
be
predict
nor
would
i
have
dare
put
a
bet
on
it
myself

when

extremely
successful
company

for

and
yrj
niskanen

at
that

be
offer
to
take
on
the
role
of
ceo
we
also
dealt
with
some
other
practical
matter
i
have
one
request
for
my
new
boss
i
want
complete
freedom
in
choos
ing
my
staff
ehrnrooth
and

my
report
be
put
into
final
form
a
few
day
later
and
nokia
s
board
discuss
it
when
they
met
on
january
even
now
i
don
t
really
know
how
i
found
the
self
confidence
to
write
that
two
page
report
i
only
knew
that
something
have
to
be
do
money
should
flow
from
company
to
their
owner
not
the
other
way
round
line
of
re
sponsibility
should
be
simple
the
company
s
value
and
a
new
leadership
team
should
be
establish
on
that
basis
and
there
wasn
t
a
moment
to
waste
the
day
before
the
crucial
meeting
i
met
the
investment
banker
bj
rn
wahlroos
he
told
me
all
about
the
previous
year
s
discussion
on
the
own
ership
of
the
company
when
the
propose
sale
to
ericsson
have
collapse
one
bank
s
shareholder
group
have
come
up
with
an
alternative
the
idea
be
that
some
of
the
shareholder
would
have
nokia
delist
from
the
stock
ex
change
by
buying
out
its
share
the
debt
arise
from
this
purchase
would
have
be
pass
to
nokia
for
payment
in
this
way
nokia
would
have
be
come
a
private
company
i
have
no
experience
with
private
company
i
have
only
work
in
citibank
which
be
a
big
firm
list
on
the
stock
exchange
after
that
i
have
move
to
nokia
also
a
list
company
though
not
one
that
brought
much
joy
to
its
shareholder
in
the
difficult
year
at
the
end
of
the
s
and
begin
of
the
s
ultimately
nokia
s
auditor
refuse
to
allow
this
arrangement
it
s
hard
to
say
if
nokia
would
have
survive
as
a
private
company
own
by
one
bank

against
all
odds
ing
group
it
be
much
easy
to
measure
nokia
against
its
target
if
it
be
a
list
company
the
market
be
merciless
and
put
a
price
on
our
capability
every
single
day
i
m
not
sure
if
a
private
owner
would
have
be
ready
for
that
enormous
change
we
be
compel
to
make
in
order
for
our
value
on
the
stock
exchange
to
rise
these
be
difficult
question
to
which
there
really
be
no
final
answer
at
the
begin
of
we
knew
only
that
nokia
be
a
public
company
and
would
stay
that
way
the
board
make
the
formal
decision
to
appoint
me
at
its
meeting
on
january
the
company
would
now
have
just
one
leader
kalle
isokallio
left
nokia
at
once
and
simo
vuorilehto
would
stand
down
from
his
role
as
chief
executive
and
chairman
of
the
executive
board
as
of

his
place
at
a
general
meeting
on
april
rumor
that

would
be
broken
up

after
my

all
around
and
we

with
everyone
we
dealt
with
the
bank
who
be
reluctant
to
finance
us
the
shareholder
who
didn
t
trust

as
a
sound
investment
and
the

who
be
lose
faith
in

point
perhaps
our
competitor

on

of
all
that

bidder
among
its

when
i
begin
as
chief
executive
in
rebuild
trust
be
the
most
important
task
face
me
i
would
also
need
to
assemble
a
new
team
just
as
i
have
when
i
take
charge
of
mobile
phone
apart
from

people
i
spent
that
spring
firefighting
try
to
prevent
the

from
go
under
and
morale
from
crumble
com
pletely
my
diary
from
that
time
show
that
i
met
many
banker
around
europe
and
the
united
state
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
our
finance
director
and
i
use
to
travel
to
try
to
persuade
people
that
nokia
do
indeed
have

against
all
odds
a
future
and
to
patiently
try
to
rebuild
trust
every
banker
want
to
know
what
we
intend
to
do
with
the
unprofitable
consumer
electronics
opera
tion
in
march
banker
from
kommerzbank
come
to
our
head
office
in
helsinki
we
all
sat
in
our
conference
room
and
i
told
the
bemuse
bank
er
that
the
entire
european
consumer
electronics
industry
be
badly
run
now
be
the
time
for
some
real
businessmen
to
come
in
i
say
as
i
try
to
convince
my
listener
with
some
carefully
chosen
word
the
german
banker
seem
to
believe
me
because
they
continued
to
finance
nokia
after
that
meeting
i
have
never
be
sure
where
my
own
self
confidence
come
from
consumer
electronics
be
our
big
problem
and
back
in
i
have
no
idea
how
long
it
would
take
and
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
solve
it
but
my
own
self
confidence
be
infectious
and
persuade
others
to
trust
us
a
few
month
later
olli
pekka
and
i
be
on
the
banking
circuit
in
zu
rich
where
we
stayed
at
the
baur
au
lac
hotel
the
doorman
there
be
amaze
when
a
car
from
credit
suisse
take
us
to
the
airport
those
men
must
be
really
rich
if
the
bank
ferry
them
around
in
a
limo
they
whis
pered
to
one
another
the
truth
be
completely
the
opposite
nokia
owe
so
much
to
credit
suisse
that
the
bank
want
to
do
everything
within
its
power
to
ensure
that
its
debtor
wouldn
t
disappear
before
they
could
catch
their
flight
back
to
finland
much
later
i
take
a
closer
look
at
my
travel
between
and
on
average
i
be
travel
day
each
year
this
be
roughly
half
the
work
ing
day
in
a
year
and
nearly
one
in
three
of
all
day
most
of
my
trip
be
abroad
i
use
to
go
five
or
six
time
a
year
to
asia
and
seven
or
eight
time
to
the
united
state
between
and
i
go
to
china
fifty
two
time
the
chief
executive
of
a
major
company
can
t
travel
more
than
this
other
wise
the
company
will
start
to
suffer
from
a
lack
of
leadership
a
leader
have
to
be
present
modern
communication
do
indeed
help
but
all
the
blogging
or
tweet
in
the
world
can
t
substitute
for
a
physical
presence
i
don
t
remember
many
of
the
detail
of
that
spring
my
diary
say
that
as
well
as
banker
i
met
many
shareholder
and
staff
that
i
held
numerous
internal
meeting
and
that
i
always
travel
to
see
customer
when
they
want
me
to
i
work
from
morning
to
night
and
into
the
small
hour
so
that
nokia
could
be
save
it
be
truly
a
battle
for
survival
the
company
have
to
regain
trust
by
every
possible
mean
both
internally
and
externally
in

area
of
consumer
electronics
the
german
thought
we
would
be
ready
to
sell
the
very
unit
on
which
our
future
would
be
base
siemens
would
eventually
withdraw
from
the
mobile
phone
business
i
listen
politely
promise
to
reply
in
due
course
and

the
distinguish

couple
of
time

to
finland
on
the
afternoon
of
june
we
have
prepared
a
little
cup
of
coffee
for
him
in
the
dark
panel
meeting
room
next
to
my

german
stiffen
mr

i
do
hope
you

that
you
be
make
a
great
mistake
he
manage
to
say
when
he
have
recover
from
his
surprise
he
rise
from
the
table
halfway
through
his
coffee
you
will
be
hearing
more
from
us
say
the
representa
tive
of
siemens
just
before
the
door
slam
shut
i
sat
down
again
we
have
avoid
a
major
trap
but
i
have
to
say
i
felt
rath
er
more
isolated
as
a
result
nevertheless
we
felt
that
we
have
make
the
right
decision
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
sari
baldauf
and
i
we
be
on
our
own
now
we
would
have
to
be
even
faster
and
more
agile
if
we
be
to
topple
the
goliath
i
take
full
responsibility
for
my
decision
which
in
truth
be
base
on
nothing
more
than
my
self
confidence
and
my
trust
in
nokia
s
capabili
tie
so
i
didn
t
tell
the
board
about
the
visit
of
the
man
from
siemens
the
chairman
of
the
board
casimir
ehrnrooth
heard
about
it
only
a
year
later
but
he
didn
t
complain
the
outcome
be
the
right
one
i
get
on
extremely
well
with
the
new
chairman
from
day
one
it
say
some
thing
about
casimir
ehrnrooth
s
career
in
finnish
business
that
he
have
first
sat
on
the
board
of
a
list
company
as
far
back
as
when
he
be
just
twenty
three
he
be
a
highly
cultivate
and
skilled
manager
and
business
man
he
have
not
spent
his
career
in
technology
company
but
in
forestry
he
be
a
highly
conscientious
member
of
nokia
s
board
and
briefed
himself
thoroughly
on
our
field
of
activity
and
our
figure
whenever
i
talk
to
him
and
ask
his
opinion
i
receive
a
clear
reply
he
do
not
defer
matter
to
unnecessary
meeting
or
work
group
and
this
be
crucial
when
the
change
in
nokia
be
so
rapid
he
be
especially
interested
in
corporate
governance
he
be
absolutely
clear
about
the
division
between
the
role
of
the
ceo
the
board
of
director
and
the
board
chairman
within
this
framework
he
allow
those
of
us
with
day
to
day
responsibility
a
great
deal
of
freedom
and
room
for
movement
at
that
time
the
board
of
company
list
on
the
finnish
stock
exchange
often
have
work
committee
at
nokia
this
committee
comprise
the
chief
executive
the
board
chair
and
the
deputy
chair
at
that
time
yrj
niskanen

against
all
odds
the
work
committee
met
once
a
month
and
we
spoke
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
about
the
current
situation
in
the
company
and
in
the
market
when
necessary
an
outside
expert
might
be
invite
to
give
a
presentation
on
a
select
subject
i
make
these
meeting
very
brief
at
casimir
ehrnrooth
s
suggestion
we
abolish
the
work
committee
in
since
there
be
no
real
point
to
it
ehrnrooth
be
extremely
consistent
in
carry
out
his
duty
when
thing
be
difficult
as
they
often
be
he
show
understand
and
give
us
support
in
i
become
chairman
of
the
board
in
ponder
this
role
i
take
the
way
casimir
ehrnrooth
have
carry
it
out
as
my
reference
point
although
i
have
confidence
both
in
nokia
s
management
and
in
myself
i
wasn
t
entirely
hopeful
i
didn
t
know
whether
we
could
be
sure
of
survive
even
if
we
do
as
well
as
we
possibly
could
the
consumer
electronics
divi
sion
be
still
hemorrhage
cash
spring
didn
t
bring
nokia
back
into
the
black
we
publish
our
result
for
the
first
four
month
of
the
year
in
june
just
before
the
whole
of
finland
go
on
holiday
at
midsummer
the
bottom
line
be
a
heavy
loss
heavier
than
ever
before
at
the
same
point
in
the
previous
year
we
have
make
million
markka
million
at
price
now
our
loss
be
million
markka
million
for
tactical
reason
we
release
the
result
at
a
time
when
most
finn
have
other
thing
than
economic
news
to
think
about
but
after
midsummer
the
headline
be
big
than
before
the
press
wonder
if
nokia
could
ever
rise
to
the
surface
and
whether
the
company
s
ceo
have
any
credibility
the
medium
s
silence
during
the
spring
have
turn
into
a
furious
onslaught
i
drove
liisa
and
the
child
to
our
summer
place
at
orivesi
but
my
holi
day
wasn
t
long
by
july
i
be
already
at
a
meeting
in
the
united
kingdom
there
after
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
jamont
the
paper
company
i
met
my
trust
adviser
per
karlsson
we
sat
together
in
the
great
hall
of
a
country
house
while
outside
the
sun
shone
on
the
english
countryside
per
could
you
do
me
a
favor
could
you
help
me
get
us
out
of
consumer
electronics
the
figure
be
just
dreadful
i
need
help
fast
i
say
i
can
try
he
reply
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
and
i
have
agree
we
should
ask
per
to
discus
with
philip
the
electronics
company
whether
there
be
the
possibility
for
a
joint
venture
or
even
the
sale
of
the
money
lose
division
these
talk
with
per
help
a
little
at
least
july
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
time
in
my
entire
career
while
many
matter
be
progress
reasonably
well
we
still
didn
t
know
whether
nokia
be
safe
the
collapse
of
consumer
electronics
a
grand
title
for
various
television
assembly
plant
scatter
around
europe
be
drag
down
nokia
s
prof
itable
and
grow
sector
even
though
the
figure
for
mobile
phone
and
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
telecommunication
network
have
improve
so
our
share
price
also
sank
low
nokia
be
become
an
interest
purchasing
prospect
for
those
most
familiar
with
the
firm
s
affair
company
other
than
siemens
be
start
to
understand
nokia
s
potential
for
growth
would
we
sink
before
we
really
start
to
grow
or
would
we
soon
reach
the
surface
and
break
through
into
profitable
growth
that
be
the
only
question
on
my
mind
in
july
the
follow
month
would
surely
an
swer
it
i
thought

against
all
odds
chapter
new
plan
i
n
the
autumn
of
nokia
s
executive
committee
make
a
decision
that
have
a
more
last
impact
than
most
in
the
company
s
history
we
chose
a
slogan
for
nokia
i
have
ask
the
head
of
communication
matti
saarinen
to
come
up
with
a
phrase
that
capture
what
we
be
try
to
do
saarinen
present
us
with
a
long
list
of
idea
we
have
a
discussion
base
on
the
list
that
take
less
than
half
an
hour
we
cross
out
all
but
five
of
matti
s
suggestion
all
of
which
be
link
in
some
way
with
the
theme
of
human
technology
or
connect
people
then
we
take
a
time
out
and
agree
that
we
would
come
back
to
the
question
at
our
next
meeting
a
month
later
there
we
affirm
with
one
voice
that
connect
people
be
our
guide
principle
at
that
time
the
field
of
wireless
communication
be
still
young
so
we
be
in
the
happy
position
that
we
could
make
our
choice
freely
because
not
all
the
best
slogan
have
yet
be
snap
up
board
and
committee
be
not
always
the
strong
link
in
the
creative
process
but
connect
people
have
show
its
stay
power
in
we
have
at
last
decide
that
nokia
would
concentrate
on
telecom
munications
the
decision
be
clear
brave
and
final
i
believe
in
it
myself
know
that
my
whole
career
depend
on
get
this
decision
right
i
communicate
the
decision
at
workplace
meeting
typically
to
about
a
hundred
people
at
a
time
of
these
perhaps
twenty
would
find
a
place
at
the
nokia
of
the
future
that
i
believe
in
the
other
eighty
belong
to
the
part
of
the
company
we
have
decide
to
sacrifice
the
sacrifice
be
need
for
two
reason
we
need
to
concentrate
on
an
area
where
we
would
be
one
of
the
world
s
best
and
it
have
to
be
in
a
grow
market
only
this
combination
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
could
save
us
it
be
clear
that
both
make
our
decision
and
explain
it
cause
people
pain
distress
and
anxiety
about
their
own
future
in
many
case
the
anxiety
prove
well
found
but
thing
be
go
so
badly
at
nokia
in
that
almost
everyone
knew
that
the
company
be
fight
for
its
very
existence
nokia
have
never
be
a
homogeneous
company
for
its
entire
history
it
have
be
make
up
of
individual
unit
or
subsidiary
that
often
compete
with
each
other
in
nokia
still
have
separate
unit
responsible
for
mo
bile
phone
telecommunication
network
cable
consumer
electronics
and
basic
industry
these
unit
or
rather
the
people
work
in
them
often
didn
t
have
the
faintest
idea
of
what
people
in
the
other
unit
do
people
didn
t
feel
they
be
work
for
nokia
but
only
for
their
own
unit
my
vision
of
nokia
s
future
crystallize
around
four
key
concept
which
i
express
in
english
because
that
be
the
language
in
which
we
need
to
do
business
they
be
focus
global
telecommunication
orient
and
high
value
add
these
word
encapsulate
a
decade
of
activity
at
nokia
back
in
they
be
aspiration
but
by
the
end
of
the
decade
they
be
also
achievement
each
of
the
four
concept
have
its
own
story
to
tell
the
number
of
concept
wasn
t
a
matter
of
chance
i
believe
that
people
can
absorb
no
more
than
four
concept
at
a
time
three
be
often
too
few
and
five
be
already
too
many
to
remember
over
the
year
people
work
under
me
have
learn
my
way
of
do
thing
i
expect
them
to
simplify
even
com
plex
matter
to
enable
us
to
communicate
our
goal
clearly
focus
meant
that
nokia
really
would
concentrate
on
those
area
we
be
lieved
in
it
s
also
however
an
instruction
on
how
to
work
we
have
neither
time
nor
money
to
waste
on
the
wrong
thing
in
we
be
a
challenger
in
almost
every
market
we
have
to
devote
all
our
resource
to
narrow
clear
aim
we
have
to
find
exactly
those
area
where
our
competitor
be
weak
est
or
those
area
where
we
have
budding
know
how
that
we
could
quickly
nurture
and
spread
and
we
expect
all
our
manager
at
nokia
to
focus
on
their
own
work
method
and
time
management
and
to
concentrate
on
what
be
essential
global
be
back
in
an
as
yet
unrealized
ambition
for
nokia
of
course
we
have
our
international
activity
nokia
have
factory
sale
subsid
iaries
and
representative
around
the
world
but
we
didn
t
really
function
on
a
global
scale
we
lack
global
logistics
marketing
and
a
global
brand
we
be
use
to
compare
ourselves
to
the
swede
and
to
ericsson
but
that
be
no
longer
enough
i
announce
that
we
have
to
fly
beyond
stockholm
airport
and
engage
with
more
distant
part
of
the
world
our
entire
mode

against
all
odds
of
operation
have
to
go
global
we
have
a
great
deal
to
do
our
organizational
structure
our
attitude
and
our
communication
and
marketing
method
have
to
change
when
do
nokia
become
a
global
company
i
think
we
start
to
work
in
a
global
way
in
that
be
when

our

we

so
that
the

my

people
woke
up
and
stir
themselves
and
the
company
begin
to
pull
itself
together
these
basic
aim
need
to
be
repeat
and
repeat
all
the
time
and
everywhere
everyone
have
to
learn
what

about

come
from
i
don

exactly

i
have
put
together
my

short
vision
of
nokia
s
future
when
i
be
ask
to
take
over
as
ceo
i
believe
in
that
vision
which
would
turn
nokia
into
a
telecommunication
company
everything
else
be
in
principle
for
sale
it
s
part
of
my
nature
that
if
i
internalize
a
vision
i
ll
be
ready
to
do
everything
i
can
to
make
it
a
reality
although
my
colleague
and
i
understood
the
opportunity
open
to
nokia

vulture

what
they
take
for

calculation
of
how
nokia
might
best
be
split
up
and
sell
my
first
year
as
ceo
have
be
diffi
cult
even
bleak
after
the
spring
of
i
didn
t
know
if
nokia
would
make
it
i
have
never
be
deeply
depressed
but
my
darkest
moment
be
during
that
summer

against
all
odds
chapter
value
underlie
everything
i
demand
a
great
deal
from
the
people
at
nokia
but
every
chief
executive
expect
a
lot
from
his
or
her
employee
it
s
like
say
that
a
swim
teacher
make
her
pupil
go
in
the
water
it
s
essential
for
get
the
job
do
as
chief
executive
i
expect
everyone
in
a
position
of
responsibility
to
have
their
fact
and
figure
straight
senior
executive
don
t
generally
lay
their
pen
down
on
their
desk
at
quarter
past
four
in
the
afternoon
as
hap
pen
in
most
of
finland
s
office
i
work
evening
and
weekend
and
so
do
many
others
at
nokia
it
must
often
have
seem
to
them
and
their
fami
lie
tedious
and
unreasonable
no
one
can
know
what
a
chief
executive
s
job
be
like
until
they
do
it
them
self
i
have
observe
closely
how
kari
kairamo
and
simo
vuorilehto
set
about
their
duty
but
it
be
only
when
i
take
over
that
i
really
grasped
how
wretchedly
difficult
and
onerous
it
could
sometimes
be
the
chief
executive
s
position
at
nokia
in
the
early
s
sometimes
felt
especially
hard
the
company
s
statistic
be
dismal
the
bank
be
breath
ing
down
our
neck
and
in
the
back
of
our
mind
be
the
fear
that
one
of
our
competitor
would
buy
us
out
i
knew
too
that
among
my
closest
col
league
be
people
who
be
wait
for
me
to
fail
and
want
to
step
into
my
shoe
i
have
no
guarantee
that
the
company
i
be
lead
would
take
wing
condition
in
the
early
s
be
difficult
and
sometimes
my
feel
ings
boil
over
i
raise
my
voice
too
often
but
i
also
try
to
support
my
management
team
eventually
we
get
the
struggle
company
back
on
its
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
foot
and
this
lift
the
spirit
of
the
people
run
it
our
success
make
us
feel
we
be
all
in
it
together
and
give
us
the
energy
to
go
on
as
a
management
tool
i
sometimes
deliberately
give
meeting
an
adren
alin
boost
we
can
all
imagine
the
torpid
atmosphere
in
regular
two
hour
meeting
where
the
work
of
a
business
unit
be
minutely
examine
tedium
and
a
lack
of
meaningful
activity
be
dangerous
for
a
company
they
re
sopo
rific
and
they
turn
the
company
s
management
into
a
bloat
politburo
i
want
to
fight
this
and
so
i
raise
my
own
level
of
energy
and
intensity
some
people
regard
this
as
rant
leadership
be
a
skill
that
can
be
learn
and
experience
be
the
founda
tion
on
which
one
can
start
to
build
a
management
style
i
grow
as
a
leader
in
perhaps
the
most
visible
position
in
finnish
business
life
and
my
man
agement
style
have
evolve
over
the
year
the
rough
edge
have
become
smoother
there
s
no
need
to
make
a
fuss
about
those
explosion
from
jor
ma
anymore
since
they
don
t
often
happen
now
say
matti
alahuhta
one
of
my
closest
colleague
sometime
at
the
begin
of
the
s
many
people
completely
misunderstand
how
an
enterprise
the
size
of
nokia
be
run
they
imagine
that
the
chief
executive
personally
intervenes
in
every
little
issue
where
there
might
be
a
problem
that
would
be
neither
po
sible
nor
reasonable
when
i
take
over
as
chief
executive
nokia
employ
roughly
people
the
successful
leadership
of
such
a
large
group
de
mands
share
value
in
the
early
s
value
leadership
be
still
a
relatively
new
concept
in
the
s
the
discussion
have
move
on
and
value
have
shift
in
significance
now
we
talk
for
example
of
the
significance
of
work
in
any
case
it
s
generally
understood
that
employee
be
not
solely
motivate
by
external
incentive
such
as
pay
in
we
didn
t
have
a
clue
how
a
global
company
should
be
run
we
didn
t
even
need
to
know
because
at
that
stage
nokia
hadn
t
really
become
a
global
company
nokia
s
top
management
be
a
group
of
young
manager
who
be
extremely
ambitious
but
inexperienced
we
have
to
learn
to
trust
each
other
completely
in
all
circumstance
in
good
time
as
well
as
bad
i
have
encapsulate
nokia
s
objective
in
four
key
concept
but
objective
and
value
be
not
the
same
thing
our
value
need
to
be
something
that
people
genuinely
want
to
be
commit
to
but
also
something
that
nokia
want
them
to
commit
themselves
to
we
need
a
value
system
that
would
hold
up
well
should
the
company
succeed
a
company
s
value
will
often
see
it
through
the
hard
time
because
then
people
have
to
pull
together
and
trust
one
another
but
the
significance
of
value
will
be
call
into
ques
tion
if
the
company
do
well
sudden
and
unexpected
success
be
one
of
the

against
all
odds
great
risk
to
a
business
then
the
company
acquires
the
wrong
sort
of
arrogance
the
customer
be
forgotten
self
satisfaction
increase
and
sensi
tiveness
to
change
diminishes
the
root
of
the
work
on
value
lay
year
back
in
telenokia
our
telecom
munications
network
unit
i
kick
off
our
wider
discussion
of
nokia
s
val
ues
in
spring
i
set
up
a
work
group
to
consider
nokia
s
core
value
and
mission
the
group
identify
and
affirm
three
nokia
value
these
value
be
implicit
in
the
way
the
company
operate
but
they
need
to
be
clarify
they
be
customer
orientation

and
continuous
learn
the
group
discover
one
new

they
felt
it
im

s
success

by
no
mean
assure
and
i
deliver
a
rather
long
and
gloomy
monologue
straight
from
my
heart
we
also
have
a
long
discussion
about
our
value
our
mission
and
our
work
method
our
gaze
be
very
much
fo
cused
on
the
present
which
still
present
many
threat
but
we
also
glance
toward
the
future
it
help
that
there
be
no
one
there
who
hanker
after
a
golden
past
our
meeting
manage
to
convince
nokia
s
senior
management
that
we
need
a
statement
of
share
value
some
of
them
regard
the
whole
pro
ce
as
an
utter
waste
of
time
that
should
have
be
spent
on
sale
or
product
development
but
just
a
few
month
later
everyone
agree
that
without
our
discussion
of
value
we
wouldn
t
have
gotten
through
at
that
meeting
we
gain
an
insight
that
swept
nokia
forward
by
ten
year
after
our
lengthy
discussion
we
understood
that
two
factor
would
determine
whether
nokia
succeed
on
the
one
hand
our
product
tech
nology
and
design
have
to
be
first
class
but
all
our
competitor
have
exactly
the
same
aim
how
could
nokia
offer
more
what
do
our
customer
really
want
by
ponder
these
question
we
come
up
with
the
nokia
way
this
be
a
package
that
contain
our
firm
s
value
work
method
process
and
mission
we
explain
our
core
value
everywhere
we
could
for
ex
ample
in
the
course
of
a
year
our
head
of
strategy
mikko
kosonen
spoke
about
nokia
s
value
and
work
method
over
a
hundred
time
in
different
place
in
different
part
of
the
world
this
be
mainly
in
internal
engage
ments
but
also
include
outside
event
customer
orientation
meant
that
we
would
correctly
identify
the
custom
er
need
we
would
add
value
for
our
customer
through
our
product
and
we
would
take
trouble
and
care
over
our
customer
we
want
our
custom
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
er
to
guide
everything
we
do
we
declare
the
customer
not
nokia
to
be
our
employer
respect
the
individual
strengthen
our
mutual
trust
but
also
make
nokia
a
good
and
attractive
employer
we
want
people
to
be
treat
hon
estly
openly
and
fairly
but
we
also
want
to
stress
that
we
all
depend
on
each
other
we
need
one
another
we
have
to
learn
to
trust
one
another
i
also
want
nokia
to
be
a
multicultural
workplace
where
we
value
diver
sity
whether
that
arose
from
gender
nationality
skin
color
or
religion
this
be
conventional
wisdom
now
but
in
the
finland
of
it
be
revolutionary
achievement
be
rather
an
obvious
value
in
a
company
every
company
want
to
meet
its
objective
a
company
should
also
want
its
employee
to
achieve
their
own
goal
along
with
the
company
s
goal
nokia
no
longer
have

internal
battle
over
our
goal
everything
have
to
be
share
perhaps
even
to
the
point
where
our
customer
could
sign
on
to
our
goal
we
emphasize
the
urge
to
win
which
be
al
ready
high
on
the
list
of
nokia
s
corporate
value
we
also
want
to
make
it
clear
to
our
employee
that
those
who
achieve
their
goal
would
be

we
want
to
demonstrate
that
we
would
reward
people
for

this
goal
be
indeed
realize
later
when
our
rev

spectacularly
many
people
at

become

of
the
way
our
incentive

structure
continuous
learn
be
perhaps
the
value
closest
to
my
heart
i
believe
that
a
company
whose
leader
and
employee
have
stop
learn
be
con
demned
to
an
early
grave
in

learn
continuous
learn
be
one
of
the
high
value
that
mean
learn
on
the
job
in
negotiation
in
relation
with
customer
and
in
develop
process
sometimes
it
also
mean
that
the
company
s
manager
continue
their
study
and
complete
dissertation
it
s
not
a
matter
of
one
off
achievement
but
an
attitude
to
ward
the
whole
of
work
and
life
it
s
the
attitude
of
an
organization
as
well
as
the
people
within
the
organization
it
cannot
be
measure
by
qualification
gain
or
some
financial
metric
but
if
a
company
loses
its
ability
to
learn
one
will
soon
see
the
result
in
red
on
the
balance
sheet
at
nokia
learn
mean
innovation
and
bold
decision
the
company
want
to
enable
its
employee
to
grow
as
people
through
their
own
job
we
accepted
that
mistake
and
failure
happen
indeed
we
want
the
right
number
of
them
to
occur
for
every
mistake
and
failure
brings
a
huge
amount
of
information
that
can
be
put
to
good
use

often

overhaul
of
the

process

against
all
odds
over
the
year
people
work
for
me
have
learn
to
recognize
my
catch
phrase
which
be
that
everyone
in
the
company
have
the
right
to
make
mi
take
but
never
the
same
mistake
twice
the
concept
of
a
humble
and
open
mind
be
also
link
to
these
value
i
m
always
afraid
i
ll
be
misunderstood
when
i
talk
of
humility
humility
doesn
t
mean
humiliation
timidity
or
excessive
caution
nor
do
it
mean
a
lack
of
self
esteem
it
mean
such
strong
self
esteem
that
an
individual
or
a
com
pany
have
the
strength
to
show
humility
in
the
face
of
difficult
or
unfamiliar
fact
and
fresh
challenge
i
also
mean
humility
toward
competitor
when
they
have
succeed
in
do
something
special
in
my
view
pertti
korho
nen
show
exemplary
humility
when
he
picked
up
motorola
s
new
phone
in
he
recognize
that
motorola
have
come
up
with
a
brilliant
product
though
even
then
he
be
sure
that
nokia
could
do
even
well
that
belief
take
us
a
long
way
for
it
lead
to
the
creation
of
our
success
story
the
nokia

as
well
as
establish
our
core
value
we
agree
how
nokia
would
be
run
we
decide
that
our
structure
should
be
as
flat
and
decentralize
as
possible
they
should
also
be
as
efficient
as
possible
and
everything
should
be
base
on
teamwork
manager
should
set
clear
goal
for
the
operation
they
supervise
manager
and
foreman
should
work
primarily
as
coach
who
would
enable
those
work
for
them
to
realize
their
potential
and
the
organization
should
do
all
that
it
could
to
promote
the
mobility
of
the
labor
force
nokia
be
construct
a
company
that
believe
in
free
and
active
global
mobility
for
people
it
would
have
be
mind
boggling
if
we
hadn
t
believe
in
mobility
within
our
own
company
we
identify
three
process
that
we
saw
as
the
most
important
in
the
new
nokia
they
be
strategic
planning
financial
control
and
human
re
source
management
but
even
more
important
than
the
process
be
the
value
which
precede
everything
the
process
be
there
only
to
enable
the
company
to
realize
the
goal
base
on
its
value
the
example
of
nokia
in
the
s
show
how
a
company
can
be
run
on
the
basis
of
value
we
call
this
value
base
management
which
may
not
have
be
very
imaginative
but
make
it
clear
what
we
be
about
senior
manager
often
imagine
that
once
the
value
have
be
identify
and
communicate
to
the
staff
thing
will
be
fine
but
from
my
own
experience
i
would
say
that
if
value
base
management
be
take
seriously
communicate
the
value
be
only
the
first
stage
at
nokia
we
start
by
explain
our
value
to
our
hundred
most
im
portant
manager
in
january
that
spring
we
organize
far
event
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
we
disseminate
nokia
s
new
value
and
guide
principle
throughout
our
global
organization
later
in
the
spring
we
consider
what
the
value
would
mean
for
our
human
resource
management
our
value
and
guide
principle
would
have
no
meaning
unless
they
be
incorporate
into
the
everyday
activity
in
the
company
personnel
management
be
the
most
important
area
of
all
because
the
company
be
begin
to
grow
which
meant
hire
new
people
select
new
manager
and
increase
mobility
inside
nokia
the
global
energy
firm
enron
which
collapse
into
wrong
do
and
criminality
have
a
fine
set
of
value
well
than
those
of
many
company
but
they
weren
t
incorporate
into
the
everyday
activity
of
the
company
i
remember
well
the
time
we
first
outline
our
new
value
to
senior
man
agers
some
of
my
colleague
be
enthusiastic
some
be
indifferent
and
some
show
openly
that
they
thought
the
new
chief
executive
s
speech
be
just
for
show
and
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
everyday
life
on
the
one
hand
the
value
raise
many
expectation
while
on
the
other
people
be
skeptical
about
whether
they
would
actually
lead
to
anything
i
have
thrown
myself
behind
the
new
value
and
the
idea
of
value
base
leadership
i
spoke
about
value
in
hundred
of
meeting
other
senior
man
agers
be
require
to
discus
them
with
their
own
subordinate
no
one
be
allow
to
let
the
discussion
of
value
slip
off
the
agenda
the
nokia
way
be
just
as
important
as
the
manufacture
and
marketing
of
mobile
phone
the
purchasing
of
component
or
put
together
the
company
s
business
plan
it
be
even
more
important
really
i
don
t
think
we
could
actually
have
gotten
the
business
go
until
we
have
work
out
what
we
all
fundamen
tally
believe
in
and
how
we
want
to
run
nokia
together
in
every
meeting
and
board
discussion
i
make
it
clear
how
much
i
myself
believe
in
our
work
on
value
i
make
sure
that
the
company
would
meet
its
financial
target
of
course
every
day
i
make
decision
small
and
large
but
i
knew
that
only
a
common
culture
and
common
value
could
bring
nokia
back
to
growth
and
a
new
resurgence
where
the
company
would
endure
the
pain
and
danger
of
success
only
then
would
its
real
ethos
be
test
nokia
s
personnel
people
often
say
that
even
big
boy
can
cry
they
be
refer
to
our
staff
appraisal
process
which
look
each
year
at
what
in
dividuals
have
achieve
how
they
have
developed
and
their
character
many
company
hold
development
discussion
with
their
staff
but
by
the
early
s
nokia
already
have
a
system
where
superior
subordinate
and
peer
all
evaluate
each
other
i
believe
in
the
power
of
example
so
at
nokia
we
ex
tend
these
discussion
to
include
executive
board
member
right
up
to
the

against
all
odds
chief
executive
thus
i
too
receive
an
annual
appraisal
of
my
development
in
accordance
with
nokia
s
value
it
be
sometimes
hard
but
necessary
nokia
s
core
value
be
knit
into
these
development
discussion
ev
erything
be
measure
in
relation
to
those
value
there
be
year
when
we
focus
on
just
one
out
of
the
four
core
value
we
might
want
for
ex
ample
to
do
well
in
respect
the
individual
then
all
our
discussion
would
stress
just
that
value
our
personnel
department
also
laid
stress
on
understand
people
s
own
value
if
for
example
a
manager
or
expert
be
post
into
an
unfamiliar
culture
our
company
s
value
be
not
intend
to
contain
even
the
slightest
hint
of
cultural
superiority
so
we
create
a
method
to
help
us
check
out
the
value
held
by
key
employee
before
they
be
post
when
our
personnel
department
be
give
value
related
objective
we
gain
several
additional
tool
for
change
the
organization
the
personnel
department
s
job
be
to
ensure
that
the
nokia
way
be
the
crucial
principle
in
recruitment
managerial
appointment
and
team
building
from
now
on
those
value
would
form
the
sole
basis
for
the
development
of
our
work
force
it
would
ensure
continuity
real
security
dynamism
and
consistency
it
would
also
differentiate
nokia
from
other
employer
we
would
be
able
to
say
very
simply
what
we
believe
in
and
how
we
saw
ourselves
we
believe
it
would
make
nokia
an
attractive
company
on
the
interna

should
have
come
as
no

there
between

the

which
fortunately
begin
to

on

which
be
not
always
easy

if
my

to
me
to

for
a

at

a
concrete
and
realistic
question
and
even
now
i
m
not
quite
sure
what
the
right
answer

west
german
televi
sion
channel
they
secretly
watch
nokia
happen
to
own
some
of
these
this
cause
a
spike
in
demand
which
obscure
the
real
future
of
the
tele
vision
market
more
experienced
television
maker
such
as
philip
point
ed
out
that
this
sudden
growth
in
demand
be
a
one
off
it
might
last
six
month
but
after
that
production
would
fall
back
to
its
old
depressed
and
depress
level
but
at
nokia
we
be
desperately
short
of
good
news
just
then
so
such
warning
from
our
dutch
competitor
be
not
take
seriously
on
the
contrary
nokia
s
then
president
kalle
isokallio
use
television
production
as
an
example
of
how
nokia
could
do
well
in
the
wider
market
and
thing
look
good
for
those
first
four
month
after
that
there
be
an
appal
slide
which
at
time
look
as
if
it
might
bring
down
the
whole
of
nokia
in
philip
have
want
to
buy
our
television
manufacturing
division
and
be
ready
to
pay
real
money
million
markka
as
i
remember
million
at
price
but
german
demand
be
at
its
peak
televi
sion
be
sell
well
and
nokia
s
director
be
seize
with
a
joyful
opti
mism
and
didn
t
want
to
sell
electronics
would
make
the
company
a
global
player
the
company
s
double
head
leadership
be
in
open
disagreement
which
make
all
decision
make
difficult
there
be
also
the
fear
that
nokia
would
shrink
too
much
in
the
course
of
a
single
year
if
the
company
sell
off
both
its
computer
and
its
television
production
we
have
succeed
in
sell
our
computer
division
at
an
excellent
price
and
at
just
the
right
time
to
the
british
company
icl
just
six
month
later
we
would
have
gotten
virtually
nothing
for
nokia
data
the
deal
on
the
computer
division
be
a
combination
of
good
luck
and
of
isokallio
s
skill
while
nokia
s
other
director
wonder
whether
we
would
get
as
much
as
million
for
our
computer
division
isokallio
sent
off
a
fax
to
london
suggest
a
price
tag
of
million
million
in
money
a
figure
plucked
from
the
air
base
on
nothing
more
than
his
intuition
and
eye
for
the
game
we
should
undoubtedly
have
accepted
the
philip
offer
nokia
would
have
be
relieve
of
its
millstone
and
money
would
have
be
freed
up
for
the
expand
new
field
of
mobile
phone
and
network
it
would
also
have
clear
the
way
for
ericsson
to
buy
nokia
in
october
since
it
wouldn
t
have
have
to
worry
about
the
risk
associate
with
our
money
lose
televi
sion
production
the
major
consumer
electronics
deal
of
the
s
have
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
be
a
colossal
mistake
paradoxically
it
be
probably
those
mistake
that
ensure
that
nokia
remain
an
independent
company
this
mess
become
my
responsibility
in
consumer
electronics
be
run
from
geneva
by
the
frenchman
jacques
noel
who
be
know
as
a
good
strategic
planner
but
not
to
be
frank
for
his
successful
management
of
operation
in
february
i
want
to
know
for
myself
exactly
what
be
go
on
i
ask
our
strategic
planning
director
tapio
hintikka
to
tell
me
so
he
come
to
my
office
one
february
even
i
must
have
look
ex
hausted
i
be
work
fifteen
hour
day
at
least
six
day
a
week
hintikka
be
very
critical
of
the
way
the
consumer
electronics
operation
be
run
the
follow
morning
i
flew
to
geneva
and
heard
what
jacques
noel
and
his
team
have
to
say
their
plan
sound
good
to
me
so
the
follow
day
i
call
hintikka
back
into
my
office
what
you
told
me
be
complete
rubbish
they
have
all
the
plan
they
need
to
put
thing
right
i
say
he
gen
tly
contradict
me
hintikka
be
eight
year
senior
to
me
a
calm
and
strong
will
manager
who
be
not
afraid
to
disagree
with
me
he
told
me
that
the
same
plan
have
be
present
in
a
beautiful
leather
bound
file
four
year
earlier
but
nothing
have
come
of
them
i
look
at
the
matter
again
and
two
week
later
jacques
noel
be
replace
as
head
of
consumer
electronics
by
nokia
s
finnish
finance
director
hannu
bergholm
our
consumer
electronics
arm
cause
me
great
anxiety
in
my
first
year
as
chief
executive
we
hadn
t
sell
the
division
though
we
have
identify
op
portunities
to
do
so
it
lose
almost
as
much
money
in
as
in
the
previous
year
in
the
loss
from
consumer
electronics
be
great
than
the
whole
of
nokia
s
net
profit
for
we
be
sinking
ever
deeper
because
the
market
for
television
show
no
sign
of
grow
nokia
produce
cathode
ray
tube
and
also
complete
television
and
both
area
be
in
serious
difficulty
our
tube
factory
at
esslingen
in
germany
be
a
major
financial
loser
we
hadn
t
be
able
to
bring
production
up
to
a
profitable
level
because
we
effectively
face
a
cartel
form
by
philip
and
thomson
we
be
feverishly
look
for
an
escape
route
from
the
whole
consumer
electronics
field
we
be
perhaps
fortunate
not
to
know
that
this
millstone
would
remain
around
our
neck
for
another
four
year
the
spectrum
of
opinion
in
nokia
range
from
strong
optimism
on
the
part
of
those
who
make
the
television
to
grave
doubt
about
the
future
of
the
operation
a
view
that
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
and
i
held
strongly
when
we
discuss
consumer
electronics
together
we
wonder
whether
it
could
ever
be
a
profitable
part
of
nokia
you
must
be
joking
be
our
conclusion

against
all
odds
on
the
other
hand
i
trust
hannu
bergholm
if
he
couldn
t
knock
thing
into
shape
no
one
could
his
second
in
command
be
heikki
koskinen
who
knew
the
television
business
well
than
anyone
bergholm
told
nokia
s
board
in
a
memorandum
that
without
investment
the
esslingen
television
tube
factory
would
have
to
be
shut
down
if
our
plan
for
a
joint
venture
be
to
get
anywhere
we
have
to
show
the
world
that
we
believe
we
have
a
future
in
this
area
i
agree
to
the
investment
berg
holm
propose
at
the
outset
because
they
seem
unavoidable
without
them
we
wouldn
t
have
any
credibility
nokia
make
television
tube
and
use
them
in
make
its
own
television
nokia
make
about
million
of
the
million
television
tube
sell
in
europe
each
year
now
nokia
be
look
for
an
ally
to
help
it
boost
production
to
million
annually
we
could
have
close
the
whole
factory
but
that
would
have
have
disastrous
implication
for
nokia
s
balance
sheet
which
in
be
as
robust
as
the
first
thin
film
of
ice
on
a
finnish
lake
after
a
september
frost
we
couldn
t
afford
to
do
anything
apart
from
pump
more
money
into
make
television
we
have
no
guarantee
that
that
would
work
we
could
only
hope
for
the
best
consumer
electronics
become
the
company
s
black
hole
it
suck
so
much
time
and
energy
out
of
us
i
must
have
spent
half
my
wake
hour
think
about
talk
about
and
planning
what
to
do
with
our
consumer
electronics
division
sometimes
the
black
hole
shrank
a
little
when
demand
for
television
seem
to
be
rise
but
then
the
black
hole
would
grow
big
ger
still
no
matter
how
hard
we
try
and
the
consumer
electronics
man
agers
certainly
do
their
best
both
publicly
and
inside
the
company
i
have
to
defend
my
belief
that
our
consumer
electronics
division
could
be
make
to
prosper
i
adopt
my
most
confident
manner
straighten
my
back
and
my
tie
and
issue
statement
to
the
effect
that
we
would
knock
this
side
of
our
business
into
shape
sometimes
i
didn
t
succeed
in
disguise
the
reality
in
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
and
i
flew
to
boston
for
a
meeting
at
fidelity
the
major
inter
national
finance
house
twenty
four
sharp
and
attentive
analyst
listen
to
our
presentation
try
to
find
any
crack
they
might
exploit
for
in
vestment
purpose
nokia
be
still
relatively
unknown
then
most
people
in
the
united
state
still
thought
we
be
a
japanese
company
because
of
our
strange
name
compare
to
motorola
we
really
hadn
t
achieve
any
profile
and
we
weren
t
yet
list
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
i
start
my
presentation
by
say
that
mobile
phone
be
our
real
suc
ce
story
but
of
course
we
do
have
a
few
little
problem
with
consumer
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
electronics
i
thought
that
little
problem
be
just
within
the
bound
of
honesty
though
our
problem
be
hardly
the
small
possible
before
i
have
finish
my
sentence
a
hand
shot
up
in
the
front
row
it
belong
to
the
sharpest
analyst
of
all
and
i
think
it
held
a
gold
plat
cross
pen
the
ana
lyst
ask
just
one
question
throughout
the
whole
presentation
when
i
say
consumer
electronics
the
analyst
ask
can
it
be
save
indeed
it
can
though
i
doubt
if
it
will
ever
be
really
profitable
i
answer
though
i
didn
t
believe
it
myself
and
i
also
have
to
ask
myself
why
we
should
keep
go
in
an
area
that
would
never
be
profitable
enough
how
could
i
explain
that
to
the
board
to
the
shareholder
to
the
analyst
and
to
myself
we
have
recently
instal
a
new
management
team
at
consumer
electron
ic
which
i
have
chosen
myself
i
have
to
support
those
executive
as
ceo
must
always
support
the
executive
they
ve
appoint
until
they
cease
to
be
manager
also
thousand
of
people
depend
on
consumer
electronics
for
their
job
most
of
them
be
work
in
germany
where
a
strong
trade
union
movement
watch
out
for
factory
closure
and
politician
vigilantly
follow
what
international
company
do
what
be
more
those
thou
sand
of
people
be
certainly
work
hard
because
they
too
knew
that
time
weren
t
easy
fairness
demand
that
i
should
support
the
manager
the
worker
and
everyone
else
who
be
try
to
make
a
go
of
television
production
honesty
and
fairness
be
in
conflict
i
let
fairness
win
so
honesty
lose
out
on
this
occasion
i
don
t
mean
that
i
knew
for
sure
that
we
would
fail
but
all
the
fact
be
against
us
on
top
of
that
my
instinct
told
me
that
we
have
to
concentrate
all
our
energy
on
mobile
phone
and
mobile
phone
network
if
half
my
time
and
that
of
my
colleague
be
spent
on
contemplate
the
black
hole
of
television
production
there
be
a
risk
it
would
swallow
us
up
altogether
there
be
many
reason
why
television
production
couldn
t
succeed
some
of
these
be
common
to
all
the
european
company
that
make
tele
vision
some
be
particular
to
nokia
television
production
in
europe
be
grow
at
to
percent
annually
it
wasn
t
that
new
company
be
come
into
the
field
but
that
all
the
producer
be
increase
their
ef
ficiency
while
the
market
wasn
t
grow
the
european
market
for
televi
sion
be
mature
about
the
same
number
be
sell
every
year
the
only
exception
be
the
spike
in
demand
follow
german
unification
also
manufacturer
in
the
far
east
make
television
much
more
cheaply
than
the
european
do
in
japan
television
could
be
found
in
the
super
market
somewhere
between
the
beer
and
the
noodle
occasionally
a
tele

against
all
odds
vision
would
be
thrown
in
free
if
a
customer
bought
enough
grocery
the
european
couldn
t
compete
with
such
aggressive
pricing
and
marketing
small
and
cheap
japanese
brand
have
broken
into
the
european
market
and
customer
have
respond
enthusiastically
nokia
s
problem
be
that
it
have
acquire
a
varied
collection
of
television
factory
and
brand
and
it
simply
produce
too
many
model
in
a
com
plicate
and
expensive
production
process
our
model
would
have
fill
a
sizeable
room
in
we
make
different
model
with
a
total
of
variant
later
we
cut
back
to
model
with
only
variant
we
have
to
reduce
the
number
of
model
far
but
we
couldn
t
do
it
in
time
we
should
have
weed
out
the
redundant
model
back
in
but
the
manager
then
couldn
t
do
it
when
we
do
start
to
slim
down
our
catalog
we
be
too
late
and
could
do
nothing
about
it
as
a
purchaser
of
component
nokia
be
altogether
too
small
a
player
in
the
market
we
learn
later
when
manufacturing
mobile
phone
that
one
of
the
most
important
factor
in
our
competitiveness
be
to
get
the
right
quantity
of
the
right
component
at
the
right
time
we
couldn
t
do
anything
to
affect
the
price
or
the
availability
of
television
component
in
germany
we
have
decide
to
sell
our
television
through
outlet
our
think
be
that
we
should
team
up
with
small
market
trader
which
would
set
us
apart
from
philip
and
our
other
competitor
the
concept
be
good
but
fact
get
in
the
way
again
and
do
in
our
wishful
think
small
trader
weren
t
interested
in
our
brand
or
our
marketing
they
just
want
to
sell
television
at
whatever
price
they
could
we
make
many
other
mistake
many
of
which
i
didn
t
even
hear
about
i
try
to
believe
to
hope
to
support
and
sustain
and
to
say
good
thing
in
public
about
our
brilliant
future
on
the
european
television
market
nor
be
i
alone
in
my
public
optimism
the
european
union
be
invest
huge
amount
of
money
in
its
high
definition

a
revolutionary
tele

that
would
stimulate
the
torpid
television
market
the
money
the
enthusiasm

the
fine

be
all

european
taxpayer
paid
the
bill
for
this
attempt
to
launch
a
technology
the
customer
have
no
need
for
but
if
we
hadn
t
invest
in
television
production
or
show
our
belief
in
its
future
we
would
have
spoil
what
chance
we
have
either
of

the

and
the
past
a
t
the
begin
of
the
s
nokia
be
divide
in
two
mobile
tele
phone
and
mobile
telephone
network
we
knew
what
the
company
should
focus
on
we
have
decide
that
nokia
would
be
a
telecommunica
tions
company
but
there
be
still
a
long
way
to
go
accord
to
the
company
account
for
telecom
and
mobile

brought
the
company
million

at

while
consumer

lose
us
million
markka
million
in
other
word
consumer
electronics
lose
us
almost
as
much
money
as
our
core
business
of
telecom
make
fortunately
cable
cable
machinery
and
rubber
product
be
all
profitable
so
nokia
as
a
whole
show
profit
for
of
million
mark
million
compare
with
the
previous
year
this
be
a
major
achievement
since
in
our
loss
have
amount
to
million
markka
million
we
knew
that
growth
would
come
from
mobile
phone
and
telecommu
nications
network
and
also
that
these
be
what
we
do
best
we
do
many
thing
in
different
way
from
our
competitor
we
be
without
precon
ceptions
because
we
have
no
alternative
we
have
no
history
as
a
significant
player
in
international
telecommunication
so
all
our
decision
have
to
be
new
and
fresh
and
sometimes
improvised
improvisation
have
long
be
part
of

nokia

the

de
veloped
a
spirit
of

which
include
a
willingness
to
accept
failure

against
all
odds
the
birth
of
the

be
an
example
of
that
spirit
the

when
anssi

as
a

our
goal
be
to
sell

everyone
the
change
be
rapid
to
give
an
example
when
the

time
that
be
well
over

salary
when
the
come
on
to
the
market
in
it
cost

at
price
nowadays
the
cheapest
model
cost
a
few
ten
of
dollar
if
that
competi
tion
brought
new
product
and
special
offer
to
the
customer
so
price
fell
the
mobile

be
less

less

more

this
didn

happen
overnight
we

what
a

the

in
the

at
which
it
be

we
have

we
still

at

we
knew

we

the

who
be
both
part
of
my
core
team
later
on
it
be
easy
to
transfer
our
success
to
the
theory
of
business
leadership
in
his
famous
book
the
innovator
s
dilemma
the
american
clayton
m
christensen
described
innovation
that
lead
to
what
he
term
disruptive
competition
the
victim
of
this
be
usually
large
company
that
dominate
their
market
and
have
become
complacent
about
themselves
and
their
age
product
major
company
that
produce
telecommunication
network
have
a
great
deal
to
lose
siemens
for
example
held
sway
over
market
that
nokia
could
only
dream
about
but
nokia
decide
to
concentrate
on
one
narrow
area
telephone
network
which
would
provide
a
digital
platform
for
mo
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
bile
phone
we
chose
a
narrow
area
because
we
want
to
break
into
the
western
market
the
choice
wasn
t
particularly
bold
or
strategic
we
make
it
because
it
be
the
only
way
we
could
see
of
break
into
the
market
that
major
company
have
divide
up
between
them
we
played
a
single
card
which
happen
to
scoop
the
pool
not
everything
at
nokia
be
base
just
on
luck
or
intuition
matti
ala

have
write
a
dissertation
on
the
globalization
of

compa
ny
a
key
factor
in
their
success
be
early
entry
into
important
market
where
change
in
consumer
expectation
and
in
technology
be
apparent
our
director
of
strategy
mikko
kosonen
have
write
his
dissertation
on
the
same
theme
they
both
observe
that
when
market
open
and
globalize
company
structure
themselves
in
a
new
way
earlier
every
country
have
its
own
subsidiary
that
carry
out
a
full
range
of
function
we
understood
in
theory
and
practice
that
the
world
be
change
we
be
still
not
a
global
firm
so
we
could
structure
our
activity
differently
from
the
establish
company
we
be
compete
against
we
didn
t
set
up
a
product
develop
ment
department
or
even
a
manufacturing
capacity
in
every
country
we
developed
our
product
where
the
quality
be
best
we
make
them
where
it
be
most
efficient
to
do
so
our
old
swedish
rival
ericsson
have
do
everything
differently
the
company
have
establish
a
top
heavy
organization
in
many
country
this
drove
up
cost
and
slow
thing
down
if
every
country
have
its
own
ceo
the
company
would
quickly
be
paralyze
by
a
combination
of
self
adminis
tration
and
turf
battle
nokia
manage
to
avoid
this
danger
ericsson
found
itself
with
people
in
thailand
but
that
didn
t
stop
nokia
win
a
key
network
contract
there
though
we
have
just
people
there
the
network
business
be
completely
different
from
sell
mobile
phone
to
consumer
in
the
whole
world
there
be
only
a
few
thousand
cu
tomers
for
network
whereas
our
mobile
phone
customer
soon
num
bered
in
the
million
in
network
the
essential
thing
be
to
target
the
key
decision
maker
in
different
country
these
be
different
sort
of
people
in
one
country
decision
be
make
for
political
reason
while
in
another
they
be
base
entirely
on
commercial
factor
nokia
have
to
adapt
to
both
situation
while
bearing
in
mind
that
our
value
prohibit
us
from
com
pet
by
dishonest
or
unethical
mean
if
our
product
price
or
service
weren
t
good
enough
we
have
to
accept
the
customer
s
decision
nokia
didn
t
bribe
its
customer
or
use
political
influence
in
the
mid
s
the
mobile
phone
division
ran
into
problem
cause
by
rapid
growth
and
the
group
s
result
be
rather
weak
for
a
time
network

against
all
odds
however
produce
consistently
good
result
and
be
nokia
s
second
pillar
when
crisis
struck
it
be
network
that
kept
nokia
alive
nokia
s
network
and
mobile
phone
division
function
completely
sepa
rately
they
have
separate
subsidiary
and
even
separate
location
around
the
world
for
example
in
brazil
they
have
separate
office
in
sao
paulo
and
rio
de
janeiro
they
also
have
different
culture
though
both
do
thing
the
nokia
way
and
they
do
work
together
in
certain
area
such
as
customer
orientation
and
technology
the
importance
of
network
be
sometimes
overlook
in
the
nokia
story
because
the
growth
of
mobile
phone
be
so
spectacular
as
the
new
millen
nium
approach
network
provide
roughly
a
quarter
of
nokia
s
income
while
mobile
phone
account
for
three
quarter
i
want
to
emphasize
however
that
the
story
of
network
be
exceptional
from
two
standpoint
throughout
nokia
s
history
the
company
have
devel
oped
a
unique
and
deep
expertise
in
telecommunication
network
the
company
be
internationalize
in
the
s
on
the
basis
of
that
world
class
expertise
the
story
of
network
be
one
of
both
innovation
and
internation
alization

the
begin
of
i
knew
that
nokia
would
survive
all
of
us
at
nokia
have
already
come
a
long
way
together
and
at
last
we
start
to
feel
solid
ground
beneath
our
foot
although
the
profit
for
have
not
be
very
large
we
be
at

in
the
black

be
a
profitable
com
pany
once
more
in
the
spring
i
saw
that
our
profit
be
clearly
on
an
up
ward
curve
i
take
the
risk
of
say
so
in
the
foreword
to
our
annual
report
our
profit
for
eventually
turn
out
to
be
more
than
four

of
the
previous

the
most
profitable

history

the
leap
in
our
profit
from
million
in
in
money
to
million
in
be
the
great
est
ever
growth
of
over
percent
five
year
later
our
profit
would
be
ten
time
great
than
in
but
the
annual
growth
figure
be
small
nevertheless
i
still
have
a
lot
to
worry
about
i
fear
that
nokia

be

a

have
quietly
built
up

wasn

particularly
interested

to
put
it
bluntly
we
weren
t
expect
to
succeed

we
understood
our
position
and
we
believe
in
our

in
any
case
any
company
whose

as
its

so

support

have
suit
nokia
well
and
fit
my

style
of

in
the
s
ultimately
to
focus
on
two
area
mobile
phone
and
mobile
phone
network
be
one
for
which
i
be
largely
responsible
but
the
path
we
follow
in
turn
nokia
from
a
conglomerate
into
a
specialized
technology
company
wasn
t
logical
easy
or
short
in
i
sat
once
more
with
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
ponder
the
compa
ny
s
future
in
these
meeting
we
spoke
of
big
thing
and
small
thing
alike
we
consider
nokia
s
strategy
its
investor
and
also
little
practical
matter
i
come
up
with
what
i
thought
be
a
good
idea
i
ask
olli
pekka
what
the
value
of
our
various
sector
be
if
nokia
s
value
on
the
stock
exchange
the
total
market
value
of
its
share
be
distribute
across
the
various
sector
what
would
their
value
be
olli
pekka
couldn
t
answer
that
straight
away
but
he
promise
to
work
it
out
we
come
back
to
the
matter
a
couple
of
week
later
once
again
we
sat
in
my
office
while
olli
pekka
go
through
some
calculation
he
have
do
in
pencil
on
some
scrap
paper
he
conclude
that
our
mobile
phone
and
net
work
business
have
a
positive
value
the
cable
business
be
slightly
posi
tive
while
consumer
electronics
be
negative
to
roughly
the
same
degree
we
star
at
the
figure
for
a
moment
and
ponder
what
they
signify
they
meant
that
nokia
be
worth
what
its
mobile
phone
and
network

against
all
odds
be
worth
everything
else
that
be
consumer
electronics
and
cable
should
be
sell
off
but
this
should
be
do
in
such
a
way
that
the
company
could
be
sure
of
its
ability
to
generate
an
income
in
the
short
term
the
com
pany
s
value
in
the
eye
of
investor
be
often
a
rather
different
matter
from
the
company
s
ability
to
generate
revenue
over
the
next
few
month
or
year
i
take
olli
pekka
s
piece
of
paper
i
kept
it
in
my
leather
briefcase
where
it
be
with
me
for
at
least
two
year
it
become
an
important
reminder
of
what
nokia
have
to
do
it
be
on
the
basis
of
those
calculation
that
we
finally
decide
where
nokia
s
future
should
lie
but
such
decision
be
not
make
during
the
course
of
my
conversation
with
olli
pekka
the
next
step
be
to
speak
to
the
board
s
executive
committee
on
which
the
chairman
casimir
ehrnrooth
and
his
deputy
yrj
niskanen
also
sat
the
rationale
sound
good
but
the
board
need
to
consider
whether
nokia
be
prepare
too
big
a
bang
perhaps
we
need
a
third
opinion
we
decide
that
the
consult
firm
mckinsey
should
conduct
an
inde
pendent
examination
of
nokia
s
option
a
strategic
appraisal
of
whether
our
plan
to
focus
solely
on
mobile
phone
and
network
be
overly
bold
their
study
would
be
ready
for
the
board
s
strategy
meeting
in
hong
kong
in
may
the
consultant
decide
to
support
our
recommendation
we
estimate
that
nokia
could
have
a
percent
global
market
share
in
compare
with
percent
in
mckinsey
s
comment
on
this
be
simply
good
luck
our
market
share
in
turn
out
to
be
percent
we
also
set
out
our
own
vision
of
nokia
s
future
we
say
that
we
believe
in
organic
growth
in
mobile
phone
and
mobile
phone
network
we
also
propose
that
after
our
strategy
should
find
a
way
of
exploit
our
home
electronics
expertise
in
multimedia
product
even
though
the
growth
strategy
demand
withdrawal
from
the
actual
production
of
consumer
electronics
and
cable
once
the
strategic
direction
be
clear
we
get
down
to
work
our
cable
business
be
sell
to
international
investor
in
nokia
tyre
which
be
very
successful
be
launch
on
the
helsinki
stock
exchange
in
though
nokia
kept
hold
of
some
share
which
it
sell
in
in
october
the
board
agree
that
the
chief
objective
should
be
to
sell
the
whole
of
our
consumer
electronics
business
but
the
operation
need
to
be
restruc
tured
before
we
have
any
hope
of
sell
it
in
march
the
decision
be
make
to
close
the
cathode
ray
tube
factory
at
esslingen
our
position
be
start
to
look
a
little
brighter
because
our
success
with
mobile
phone
and
telecom
have
strengthen
our
balance
sheet
to
the
point
where
it
could
bear
the
cost
associate
with
get
out
of
television
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
at
the
board
meeting
in
june
we
set
out
a
future
for
nokia
right
up
to
we
estimate
that
the
new
strategy
could
achieve
a
profit
of
million
in
when
our
revenue
would
be
billion
the
figure
show
how
none
of
us
could
imagine
the
development
of
the
next
few
year
we
didn
t
know
nor
do
anyone
else
how
nokia
be
about
to
find
itself
at
the
very
eye
of
a
tornado
in
our
profit
be
billion
and
our
revenue
billion
the
figure
show
how
i
at
least
be
not
very
good
at
forecast
ing
the
growth
prospect
for
mobile
phone
back
in
all
nokia
s
direc
tor
have
learn
their
lesson
however
none
of
us
want
to
promise
more
than
we
could
be
sure
of
deliver
in
finnish
style
our
estimate
be
more
cautious
than
those
of
our
competitor
sometimes
during
the
year
of
ex
plosive
growth
that
left
investor
and
investment
analyst
bemuse
the
tornado
have
already
start
to
form
in
the
mobile
phone
sector
it
would
pluck
nokia
from
the
ground
and
lift
it
to
dazzle
height
later
it
would
dash
the
company
back
down
again
when
the
company
would
feel
as
if
it
be
break
up
on
re
entry
excite
time
be
in
store
for
us
excit
ing
time
that
no
one
could
imagine
in
hong
kong
in
my
idea
that
we
should
concentrate
on
what
we
do
best
and
what
we
most
believe
in
be
now
sign
and

in
this
sense
nokia
s
fate
be
settle
in
hong

in
for
the
come
year
and
indeed
decade
i
felt
that
i
bore
the
responsibility
but
my
joy
be
boundless
now
nokia
be
become
the
sort
of
company
that
i
believe
in
and
that
i
want
to
lead
but
nokia
be
still
very
much
in
a
growth
phase
and
still
have
grow
pain
to
endure

all
odds

japanese
presumably
realize
that
january
wasn
t
our
fine
hour
in

since
our
mobile

be
in

of
a
logistical
crisis
sony
saw
a
chance

of
our

with

my
polite

nokia
would
stand

on
the
strength
of
its

we
have
spent
many
month
prepare
for
cooperation
with
sony
we
set
up
work
group
and
held
serious
discussion
european
television
manu
facturers
chiefly
want
to
ensure
that
we
would
fail
whatever
we
do
since
they
want
to
reduce
television
production
capacity
in
europe
it
suit
them
for
nokia
to
do
the
dirty
work
and
close
its
factory
and
let
them
have
its
brand
name
they
weren
t
interested
in
continue

there
be

sony
be
seek
a

i
wasn

interested
in

idei
look
disappointed
but
he
remain
polite
year
later
sony
use
the
same
tactic
with
more
success
though
the
pseudo
japanese
sony

that

never
become

player
in
the

nearly
every

from

we
be
still
stuck
with
those
money
lose
factory
finally
we
decide
that
we
have
to
do
something
different
we
have
to
announce
our
intention
unless
we
told
the
world
we
be
closing
our
factory
we
would
never
find
the
partner
we
be
look
for
in
our
position
that
be
the
only
thing
we
could
do
in
november
tapio
go
to
bochum
in
germany
to
announce
our
deci
sion
to
close
the

there
he
have
be
warn
there
would
be
a
large
scale
demonstration
and
he
try
to
avoid
this
by
arrange
an
early
flight
but
the
flight
be
delayed
and
he
come
face
to
face
with
a
couple
of
thou
sand
angry
worker
he
be
warn
that
he
need
to
make
a
convincing
presentation
to
make
the
german
trade
union
understand
how
serious
thing
be
but
the
gruff
and
taciturn
tapio
wasn
t
a
man
for
presentation
he
stood
in
front

semi
tech
twice
ask
for
an
exten
sion
in
the
use
of
the
nokia
name
but
i
didn
t
agree
to
that
it
would
be
bad
enough
to
come
across
advert
for
nokia
when
i
turn
on
the
television
in
hotel
over
the
next
three
year
i
didn
t
want
it
to
go
on
after
that
our
marketing
people
be
try
with
some
success
to
make
nokia
a
globally
recognize
name
in
mobile
phone
and
mobile
communication
and
we
didn
t
want
the
public
to
be
confuse
by
other
product
range
bearing
the
nokia
name
later
thing
go
wrong
for
semi
tech
the
company
go
bankrupt
and
mr
ting
must
have
lose
his
money
but
that
wasn
t
our
prob
lem
anymore
we
have
lose
quite
enough
of
our
own
money
already
over
seven
billion
mark
of
it
over
the
year
or
billion
at
price
i
have
promise
investor
the
previous
autumn
that
television
production
would
no
longer
be
a
problem
in
i
have
kept
this
promise
and
i
be
proud
of
it
perhaps
we
should
have
make
the
tough
decision
earlier
still
it
be
right
to
give
the
people
who
ran
the
division
the
chance
to
make
it
work
even
if
it
be
up
for
sale
the
situation
have
be
difficult
since
we
have
conflict
aim
and
this
cause
stress
i
be
greatly
relieve
when
this
unhealthy
phase
end
but
i
often
ask
myself
if
i
could
have
do
some
thing
quicker
or
well
it
wasn
t
just
the
money
our
adventure
with
television
have
waste
a
huge
amount
of
time
skill
and
nervous
energy
among
our
top
management
our
planning
staff
our
expert
and
our
employee
if
that
energy
could
have
be
direct
toward
more
productive
area
nokia
could
have
do
even
well
i
can
t
blame
the
people
who
have
decide
to
make
nokia
one
of
eu
rope
s
large
producer
of
television
but
i
wish
they
d
have
the
pleasure
of
see
the
trap
they
d
set

the
generation

way
to
lead
n
okia

new
senior
management
and
management
method
take
shape
only
gradually
at
the
end
of
we
have
assemble
a
manage
ment
team
with
much
more
in
common
than
a
share
workplace
we
share
our
value
system
our
intuition
our
vision
of
the
company
s
future
and
an
exceptional
commitment
to
make
that
vision
a
reality
this
leadership
model
be
unusual
perhaps
unique
at
the
core
be
five
individual
though
in
all
there
be
around
a
dozen
people
in
the
senior
management
team
but
in
term
of
leadership
there
be
five
key
people
the
five
who
drove
the
company
forward
with
little
in
the
way
of
formal
structure
but
much
in
the
way
of
trust
and
information
share
i
have
met
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
in
my
first
few
week
at
nokia
back
in
among
his
strength
be
his
feel
for
legal
and
financial
issue
and
a
solid
understand
of
commercial
law
olli
pekka
always
have
the
com
pany
s
interest
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
he
look
continually
for
way
of
develop
synergy
between
network
and
mobile
phone
he
have
a
great
tendency
toward
pessimism
than
the
others
and
thus
often
have
the
least
to
say
sari

to

from
my
time
at

strong
engineering
heritage
and
the
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
only
one
in
our
group
who
be
really
academically

be
on
the

dynamic
of

and

ala
pietil
have
begin
at
nokia
data
in
the
s
work
on
com
puter
software
i
met
him
for
the
first
time
at
the
mobile
phone
division
in
salo
in
the
s
which
he
later
manage
pekka
brought
the
consumer
s
voice
to
our
discussion
because
he
have
internalize
mobile
phone
user
everyday
reaction
to
our
product
and
operation
without
clear
planning
or
a
single
deliberate
decision
our
group
ran
nokia
from
to
all
five
of
us
have
a
similar
background
we
be
all
finn
who
have
grown
up
in
the
province
study
in
helsinki
and
come
to
work
at
nokia
more
significant
however
be
the
difference
between
us
in
the
way
we
approach
issue
both
theoretically
and
practically
our
group
have
immense
cognitive
diversity
this
really
show
when
we
have
problem
to
solve
as
chief
executive
i
usually
found
it
anything
but
easy
to
find
an
agree
line
the
dispute
however
demonstrate
creativity
and
force
us
to
consider
all
side
of
a
question
why
five
of
us
why
not
four
or
seven
it
may
have
be
a
question
of
chance
the
five
be
there
and
that
be
that
but
later
i
come
across
a
study
by
an
american
psychologist
one
of
its
conclusion
be
that
the
opti
mal
size
for
a
group
be
chance
then
sure
enough
the
five
wasn
t
a
sort
of
military
junta
that
have
usurped
legitimate
pow
er
within
the
company
an
executive
committee
of
about
a
dozen
people
scrutinize
all
important
matter
on
a
monthly
basis
i
don
t
remember
ever
deviate
from
the
correct
procedure
we
take
great
care
over
major
deci
sion
and
they
be
only
implement
with
the
approval
of
the
board
but
before
that
stage
be
reach
the
five
would
have
do
the
basic
planning
and
discussion
usually
a
few
phone
call
be
enough
to
shape
the
issue
to
the
point
where
it
could
be
decide
because
the
group
be
completely
open
form
proper
meeting
be
very
rare
only
when
we
need
a
closer
examination
such
as
a
question
of
a
new
strategic
policy
or
a
change
in
the
company
s
procedure
do
we
all
gather
around
the
table
this
would
typically
happen
on
sunday
even
or
at
seven
o
clock
on
a
weekday
morning
these
be
the
only
time
our
diary
would
allow
we
would
usually
meet
in
my
conference
room
but
sometimes
we
would
retreat
to
b
tvik
to
the
nokia
villa
outside
helsinki
we
never
make
a
transcript
or
formal
record
of
these
or
other
meeting
i
often
have
one
on
one
meeting
with
the
other
member
of
the
five
as
well

against
all
odds
the
famous
dream
team
represent
the
united
state
in
basketball
at
the
barcelona
olympics
in
professional
player
from
the
nba
be
part
of
the
team
for
the
first
time
which
meant
that
the
team
be
over
whelm
on
the
basketball
court
the
medium
start
to
call
the
nokia
five
the
dream
team
too
though
with
the
exception
of
anssi
vanjoki
there
wasn
t
much
interest
in
basketball
at
nokia
and
within
the
company
we
certainly
didn
t
talk
of
the
dream
team
though
the
phrase
take
on
a
life
of
its
own
in
the
wider
world
have
as
many
different
meaning
as
there
be
people
who
use
it
how
be
it
possible
for
such
an
extraordinary
group
and
management
style
to
come
about
there
be
a
number
of
factor
the
most
important
be
our
common
conception
of
the
direction
nokia
should
take
and
how
high
it
be
possible
for
us
to
rise
this
have
be
form
over
the
course
of
the
year
through
experience
it
meant
a
share
vision
of
the
way
the
com
pany
should
be
lead
and
the
organization
built
up
behind
everything
be
our
share
value
system
this
meant
loyalty
to
and
trust
in
what
be
best
for
the
company
our
practical
method
include
an
intellectual
honesty
a
willingness
to
take
responsibility
an
ability
to
listen
and
a
refusal
to
play
office
politics
we
try
to
avoid
decision
that
merely
paper
over
the
crack
we
allow
contradiction
to
flourish
since
this
be
healthier
than
an
artificial
unanimity
a
good
example
be
the
ongo
ing
tension
between
the
network
and
phone
division
we
let
this
continue
unresolved
unlike
our
competitor
who
all
come
down
in
favor
of
one
or
the
other
this
approach
lead
to
a
real
collegiality
anyone
could
challenge
anybody
in
an
argument
over
fact
but
argument
about
authority
be
not
allow
to
see
the
light
of
day
value
leadership
be
the
basis
of
nokia
s
procedure
it
may
have
help
that
when
we
start
we
weren
t
particularly
close
none
of
us
have
be
close
friend
before
the
five
get
together
our
mutual
regard
be
base
on
the
knowledge
that
we
each
care
for
the
company
in
the
same
way
and
that
we
care
for
people
in
the
company
even
more
above
almost
anything
else
this
create
such
a
strong
commitment
to
our
share
project
that
it
s
not
easy
to
find
a
comparison
our
daily
work
be
characterize
by
communi
cation
and
openness
crucial
issue
be
share
between
us
so
problem
didn
t
become
surprise
because
everyone
be
work
on
the
basis
of
the
same
information
in
this
way
we
maintain
trust
despite
the
long
absence
force
on
us
by
the
need
to
spend
time
travel
over
the
year
we
developed
a
silent
internalize
trust
on
this
basis
we
could
take
risk
and
make
rapid
decision
act
in
the
company
s
name
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
without
formal
process
and
ritual
of
rubber
stamp
factory
weren
t
built
without
proper
approval
but
individual
member
of
the
five
be
able
to
make
big
but
routine
decision
independently
we
weren
t
in
the
habit
of
query
decision
retrospectively
either
everyone
understood
that
if
sari
pekka
matti
or
olli
pekka
have
make
a
decision
it
must
have
be
on
a
sound
basis
with
the
company
s
best
interest
clearly
in
mind
one
can
see
this
grow
trust
as
a
form
of
human
capital
which
in
nokia
grow
by
ex
ample
one
might
describe
nokia
s
leadership
over
these
ten
year
as
a
free
form
model
typical
of
business
in
their
growth
phase
aside
from
the
official
hierarchy
one
can
discern
four
level
the
chief
executive
the
five
the
ex
ecutive
committee
and
two
hundred
key
individual
the
four
level
be
nest
and
they
communicate
intensively
the
whole
time
the
two
hundred
or
so
key
individual
be
the
group
through
which
rou
tine
operation
be
manage
on
a
global
scale
as
chief
executive
i
found
that
i
could
speak
directly
to
them
and
so
do
the
other
member
of
the
five
in
the
s
it
be
still
usual
to
call
since
email
wasn
t
yet
in
general
use
bearing
in
mind
nokia
s
area
of
activity
the
phone
be
indeed
a
pretty
good
way
of
exchange
thought
the
other
member
of
the
five
didn
t
mind
when
i
get
in
touch
directly
with
their
subordinate
it
be
part
of
nokia
s
culture
for
its
chief
executive
to
speak
to
those
who
knew
most
about
an
issue
this
be
central
to
the
way
i
work
and
ensure
a
rapid
response
our
management
team
work
together
for
an
exceptionally
long
time
over
ten
year
such
a
long
period
be
unusual
in
a
major
global
company
because
the
pressure
be
unrelenting
and
the
physical
strain
severe
at
the
same
time
one
must
try
to
be
an
inspire
leader
to
one
s
own
staff
i
believe
there
be
a
number
of
factor
behind
our
especially
long
tenure
top
of
the
list
be
naturally
the
rapid
change
and
break
with
the
past
and
the
excitement
it
brought
we
be
living
in
extraordinary
time
every
one
of
us
be
face
with
some
very
difficult
issue
and
resolve
them
only
increase
our
confi
dence
in
each
other
our
productivity
brought
great
personal
satisfaction
to
us
all
and
add
to
our
motivation
another
factor
be
certainly
to
be
found
in
the
rotation
of
responsibility
that
every
one
of
the
group
experienced
during
those
ten
year
matti
ala
huhta
be
at
first
responsible
for
network
and
later
for
mobile
phone
after
run
the
mobile
phone
unit
pekka
ala
pietil
take
over
new
business
activity
and
strategy
as
well
as
her
responsibility
for
mobile
network
sari
baldauf
spent
two
year
on
nokia
s
business
operation
in
asia
the
rotation
allow
us
to
examine
matter
from
new
perspective
and
help
us
maintain
the
group
s
dynamism
and
creativity

against
all
odds
there
be
another
reason
for
the
five
s
practical
creativity
because
our
value
be
so
closely
align
we
have
an
exceptional
ability
to
work
together
dynamic
teamwork
at
its
fine
in
particular
i
mean
the
way
in
which
expression
of
feeling
and
sheer
passion
power
our
discussion
personal
weakness
and
strength
be
present
in
every
group
work
intensively
together
we
knew
this
and
try
to
channel
them
for
the
company
s
benefit
this
be
a
group
in
which
personal
concern
for
each
other
be
exception
ally
strong
if
you
be
exhaust
you
get
support
and
be
encourage
to
take
a
break
lose
your
temper
and
other
human
weakness
be
under
stood
i
have
often
characterize
nokia
as
a
total
experience
that
be
more
than
a
place
to
work
it
be
an
emotional
journey
in
part
this
come
from
the
positive
experience
that
the
five
share
all
good
thing
come
to
end
it
be
natural
that
at
the
start
of
the
s
we
have
to
face
different
pressure
between
and
our
workforce
grow
by
around
people
to
this
in
itself
brought
about
pressure
for
change
a
grow
global
organization
call
for
a
more
formal
mode
of
leadership
nokia
s
approach
to
leadership
be
refresh
through
the
early
s
but
time
do
its
work
and
certainly
the
whole
concept
and
its
allure
be
gan
to
fade
no
free
form
structure
if
that
isn
t
a
contradiction
in
term
can
last
forever
it
s
always
a
child
of
its
time
perhaps
the
announcement
of
my
departure
from
nokia
make
well
in
advance
of
that
event
cause
a
degree
of
restlessness
and
allow
little
shortcut
in
the
way
thing
be
do
these
be
few
however
and
in
a
handful
of
critical
problem
be
take
care
of
in
the
usual
way
in
an
exceptional
spirit
one
may
ask
whether
the
five
model
could
be
adopt
elsewhere
yes
and
no
be
my
answer
the
basic
principle
of
our
leadership
method
trust
openness
and
so
on
be
suit
to
any
organization
and
thus
can
be
rec
ommended
for
adaptation
on
the
other
hand
the
five
s
personal
work
method
can
t
simply
be
copy
this
way
of
work
be
clearly
best
suit
to
a
fast
grow
company
where
a
nimble
and
responsive
entrepreneur
ial
approach
be
need
the
ability
to
make
rapid
decision
brought
nokia
competitive
advantage
the
more
mature
the
business
environment
and
the
large
the

the
less
appropriate
our

would

i
n
june

story
headline
the
miracle
of
nokia
this
state
that
nokia
have
re
tire
from
public
life
in
to
put
its
affair
in
order
now
the
company
be
ready
to
conquer
the
world
the
cover
told
its
reader
that
jorma
ollila
have
turn
the
company
s
death
spiral
to
an
energetic
ascent
the
magazine
also
explain
that
percent
of
nokia
be
now
in
foreign
ownership
and
that
this
figure
would
rise
the
company
be
just
be
list
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
the
headline
show
how
little
have
be
expect
of
nokia
in
the
mere
fact
that
we
have
survive
and
grown
be
in
itself
cause
for
wonder
at
least
to
outsider
it
go
against
the
grain
for
me
to
use
the
word
miracle
though
we
certainly
enjoy
a
run
of
luck
which
we
desperately
need
but
it
be
more
than
luck
we
owe
our
survival
to
hard
work
careful
planning
personal
enthusiasm
and
concentration
on
the
essential
we
have
have
to
make
sacrifice
to
focus
on
the
thing
we
do
best
i
be
a
strong
believer
in
the
view
of
american
professor
jim
collins
on
how
a
company
should
set
its
strategy
it
must
identify
three
key
area
what
the
company
be
best
in
the
world
at
what
it
s
passionate
about
and
what
it
can
do
to
have
the
great
economic
impact
in
other
word
how
it
can
produce
the
great
profit
the
optimal
result
will
emerge
from
the
point
where
these
three
criterion
intersect
that
be
just
how
nokia
work
in
though
collins
excellent
theory
have
yet
to
be
publish
our
listing
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
in
july
increase
nokia
s
visibility
it
also
force
the
company
to
improve
its
message
to
investor

against
all
odds
as
we
quickly
acquire
new
and
demand
shareholder
especially
in
the
united
state
we
begin
to
report
our
result
quarterly
rather
than
three
time
a
year
which
be
the
finnish
practice
we
begin
to
hold
conference
call
with
our
investor
whenever
we
publish
our
quarterly
or
annual
re
sults
we
report
the
result
for
each
business
division
separately
the

the
measure
whereby
our

an
impact
on
nokia
s
internal
working
it
become
easy
for
me
to
demand
result
from
my
employee
because
i
could
use
the
inves
tor
reaction
both
as
a
carrot
and
a
stick
investor
and
investment
analyst
respond
rapidly
to
both
our
success
and
our
mistake
our
share
price
and
nokia
s
market
value
become
the
key
measure
of
our
success
at
the
same
time
we
become
far
less
a
finnish
company
the
share
of
foreign
ownership
grow
from
percent
in
to
percent
in
it
s
worth
note
that
at
that
time
nokia
have
two
series
of
share
the
k
share
have
great
voting
strength
and
foreign

own
just
percent
of
them
in
so
domestic
shareholder
still
have
the
decisive
voting

the

port
all
our
process
every
leader
know
that
rapid
growth
brings
danger
if
we
grow
too
fast
we
would
lose
control
and
be
unable
to
plan
our
activity
as
thoroughly
and
effectively
as
we
need
to
but
there
be
few
critical
voice
to
be
heard
the
black
year
with
all
their
worry
about
our
survival
and
their
obsessive
but
essential
cost
cut
be
at
last
behind
us
we
have
won
that
contest
even
the
banker
on
whose
door
we
have
knock
with
trepidation
a
couple
of
year
earlier
now
come
knock
on
our
door
instead
for
some
reason
they
now
want
to
offer
us
money
whereas
just
a
short
time
before
we
have
represent
a
significant
risk
for
me
a
former
banker
that
felt
especially
good

against
all
odds
chapter
an
unforgettable
year
i
n
we
enjoy
the
fruit
of
great
success
for
the
first
time
the
market
for
mobile
phone
be
boom
our
profitability
have
improve
and
our
production
be
grow
at
over
percent
a
year
like
the
rest
of
nokia
s
top
management
i
have
no
experience
of
great
suc
ce
we
knew
what
hard
time
be
although
we
have
have
time
of
opti
mism
and
growth
too
we
have
live
through
period
when
it
seem
that
our
company
could
never
become
as
big
and
strong
as
competitor
such
as
motorola
and
ericsson
we
have
also
have
some
dreadful
day
when
we
thought
everything
would
collapse
and
all
the
risk
take
on
by
the
previ
ous
generation
of
manager
would
come
crash
down
on
our
head
and
we
have
know
moment
of
jubilation
when
everything
we
do
have
come
together
when
the
nokia
spirit
and
the
nokia
team
be
at
their
very
best
we
didn
t
know
how
nokia
would
operate
as
a
global
company
in
what
be
probably
the
fast
grow
area
of
the
century
no
one
knew
anything
about
that
even
so
nokia
become
a
global
company
in
just
two
year
and
it
have
to
be
transform
we
knew
that
because
in
the
mid

sadly
not
even
nokia
s
imagination
be
up
to

we
hop
nokia
could

the

grow
out
of
its
homespun
finnish
garb
and
don
the
garment
of
global
suc
ce
that
give
us
plenty
to
think
about
and
do
these
idea
be
certainly
revolve
in
my
head
as
i
lounge
beside
the
lake
at
orivesi
that
summer
be
exceptionally
warm
we
left
the
cottage
only
for
a
trip
to
the
opera
in
the
medieval
castle
at
savonlinna
i
return
to
work
on
the
last
day
of
july
summer
end
abruptly
in
fin
land
and
by
the
end
of
july
you
can
sense
that
autumn
be
on
its
way
august
may
be
warm
and
its
evening
fine
but
already
it
s
autumn
and
when
au
tumn
come
company
sharpen
up
before
the
holiday
everything
seem
to
be
sweetness
and
light
but
thing
change
over
the
summer
sale
may
have
fall
marketing
may
have
soak
up
too
much
money
product
may
have
fail
to
find
customer
perhaps
plan
haven
t
be
complete
in
time
the
moment
of
truth
always
dawn
in
august
then
there
s
still
time
to
make
thing
well
enough
time
before
the
end
of
the
year
to
put
many
thing
straight
but
if
a
complete
collapse
be
on
the
way
august
be
already
too
late
to
avoid
it
different
type
of
business
run
accord
to
different
timetable
at
nokia
we
have
learn
that
november
be
the
decisive
month
when
the
mobile
network
operating
company
and
the
retail
outlet
stock
their
shelf
for
christmas
if
there
weren
t
enough
phone
to
meet
demand
in
november
or
if
we
didn
t
have
order
for
those
we
have
produce
the
game
be
up
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
ultimately
the
outcome
for
the
whole
year
depend
on
sale
at
christmas
especially
in
developed
market
that
be
why
in
august
the
right
sort
of
phone
need
to
be
ready
nokia
have
a
top
quality
product
ready
for
the
market
its
catalog
number
be
it
have
a
large
screen
big
than
any
of
our
earlier
mobile
phone
it
be
completely
digital
it
have
many
new
function
there
be
also
some
thing
quite
new
about
its
design
our
new
phone
be
a
real
beauty
create
by
our
chief
designer
frank
nuovo
the
design
be
completely
different
from
anything
we
be
use
to
some
of
its
more
strike
feature
its
organic
round
shape
and
the
strong
dark
band
around
the
screen
make
us
hesitate
when
nuovo
first
show
the
phone
to
pekka
ala
pietil
pekka
have
to
think
long
and
hard
whether
such
a
radical
and
innovative
model
would
really
sell
be
you
sure
pekka
ask
frank
damn
sure
reply
frank
and
so
the
decision
be
make
we
desperately
need
a
successful
new
product
for
we
have
spent
the
whole
of
the
early
s
living
off
the
old
model
and
its
descendant
this
phone
that
pertti
korhonen
and
his
team
have
design
have
be
a
global
success
in
we
be
still
sell
about
million
of
them
a
year
percent
of
our
total
sale
of
mobile
phone
but
it
be
more
than
three
year
since
this
phone
have
begin
to
conquer
the
market
and
now
we
really
need
a
new
model
to
open
a
new
chapter
in
the
nokia
story
which
be
progress
so
well
the
more
we
test
the
new
model
the
surer
we
be
that
it
would
be
a
success
these
be
bloody
fantastic
we
ll
sell
more
of
them
than
we
can
count
beyond
our
wild
dream
say
anssi
vanjoki
in
his
typical
way
so
i
have
good
reason
to
relax
in
august
the
world
s
mobile
phone
mar
kets
be
grow
fast
and
this
new
model
be
our
response
to
that
all
in
all
the
year
seem
to
be
proceed
in
line
with
the
positive
forecast
i
have
make
in
june
when
i
present
the
result
from
the
first
reporting
period
to
international
investor
and
the
medium
on
my
first
day
back
from
holiday
i
watch
the
television
news
the
main
economic
story
be
that
the
disney
corporation
have
bought
capi
tal
city
a
medium
conglomerate
that
own
the
abc
corporation
disney
thereby
become
the
big
medium
and
communication
company
in
the
united
state
i
be
happy
that
in
our
own
area
there
be
no
need
to
spend
money
on
expensive
acquisition
our
growth
and
profitability
seem
to
be
enough
for
our
investor
as
thing
be
disney
s
acquisition
cost
it

against
all
odds
billion
earn
so
much
money
back
wasn
t
go
to
be
easy
in
the
fickle
and
fast
move
medium
market
i
didn
t
envy
michael
eisner
disney
s
chief
executive
who
would
have
to
spend
the
next
decade
fight
for
profitability
and
growth
thing
be
different
in
the
mobile
phone
market
in
million
mobile
phone
be
sell
worldwide
the
follow
year
the
figure
be
million
which
be
still
less
than
one
for
every
hundred
people
if
nokia
kept
grow
in
parallel
with
the
market
it
would
grow
faster
than
anyone
could
have
predict
it
look
easy
altogether
too
easy
we
be
expect
vigorous
growth
in
if
we
increase
our
volume
and
produce
enough
phone
to
meet
demand
we
could
make
record
prof
its
we
reckon
that
the
market
would
grow
faster
in
than
anyone
else
would
predict
and
we
have
an
attractive
product
in
our
hand
we
be
ready
to
make
a
tiger
s
leap
we
be
ready
to
more
than
double
our
produc
tion
though
we
really
have
no
inkling
of
what
impact
that
would
have
on
our
organization
or
our
human
capacity
every
company
should
have
a
proper
system
for
follow
result
profit
ability
procurement
and
logistics
nokia
do
indeed
have
such
a
system
it
generate
information
but
it
have
be
design
for
a
much
small
en
terprise
it
have
grown
along
with
nokia
but
we
have
grown
so
fast
that
no
system
could
have
kept
up
the
previous
year
we
have
plan
to
adopt
the
german
sap
system
which
would
bring
together
our
production
stock
control
and
logistics
we
want
to
bind
together
all
those
little
thread
of
information
that
we
need
to
make
market
and
sell
phone
and
to
follow
cash
flow
and
prof
its
it
be
only
the
german
who
have
succeed
in
design
a
system
that
be
systematic
and
reliable
enough
but
as
often
happens
the
project
have
be
delayed
by
half
a
year
our
fine
new
reporting
system
wasn
t
yet
in
use
in
the
autumn
of
we
have
no
time
to
lament
this
delay
for
we
have
our
work
cut
out
in
source
component
make
our
phone
and
sell
them
still
everything
seem
to
be

report
three
time
a
year
the
next
report
be
due
at
the
end
of
august
the
result
still
seem
good
we
would
reach
those
target
we
have
promise
to
reach
over
the
whole
year
the
investor
and
the
medium
could
hardly
ask
for
more
we
be
increasingly
satisfied
with
our
progress
at
the
begin
of
october
pekka
ala
pietil
present
me
with
the
pre
liminary
result
for
september
they
be
somewhat
disappoint
sale
weren
t
in
line
with
our
target
and
our
cost
have
increase
the
result
be
that
we
have
broken
even
which
be
far
from
what
we
have
expect
september
wasn
t
good
but
i
m
confident
that
october
and
november
will
go
well
pekka
say
a
little
flicker
of
doubt
cross
my
mind
but
i
decide
to
take
pekka
s
word
for
it
really
i
didn
t
have
much
choice
our
reporting
system
seem
to
work
and
i
knew
there
have
be
problem
in
procure
particular
component
in
september
and
that
our
cost
have
risen
i
knew
all
about
the
problem
with
component
we
rely
on
an
israeli
subcontractor
at
which
be
the
only
company
that
could
produce
the
key
component
for
our
wonderful
new
phone
the
at
factory
in
austria
produce
those
component
and
they
be
absolutely
essential
but
in
au
gust
we
have
receive
only
or
percent
of
the
component
we
need
to
meet
our
target
it
be
a
catastrophe
usually
we
receive
over
percent
of
our
requirement
by
then
pekka
ala
pietil
and
i
flew
to
austria
where
i
give
the
subcontractor
some
very
direct
feedback
but
we
also
discuss
how
we
could
resolve
matter
we
knew
that
we
would
face
gigantic
problem
because
by
mid
septem
ber
phone
production
would
be
delayed
and
could
come
to
a
complete
halt
but
i
assume
that
the
problem
would
be
a
one
off
which
could
be
quickly
put
right
how
wrong
i
be
later
i
learn
that
good
news
and
bad
news
always
come
in
wave
a
stream
of
good
news
be
self
generate
thing
go
well
and
move
forward
as
if
they
have
a
momentum
of
their
own
market
grow
people
make
the
right
decision

the

you
hear
the
third

you
should
start
to
be
suspicious
somewhere
a

broken
out
but
the
smoke

of
your
ten

make
a
seriously
wrong
decision
whose
consequence
will
take
time
to
make
themselves
felt
or
somewhere
your
subcontractor
have
change
their
work
method
just
a
little
but
just
enough
for
your
entire
product
line
to
fail
and
for
your
customer
to
feel
permanently
let
down

from

as
i
listen
to

i
real

that
they

they

nokia

we

the
follow
week
this
be
not
just
be
cause
of
the
result
for
mobile

but
also
because
our
consumer
elec
tronics
division
have
enter
an
even
deeper
phase
of
its
downward
spiral
pekka

my

i
take
a

star
at
the

show
ing
our
result
but
i
still
couldn
t
take
them
in
that
be
odd
because
i
be
in
charge
of
this
company
after
all
have
a
successful
company
turn
into
a
company
in

without
its

notice
anything
what

could
i
trust
and
what
would
happen
to

to
me
in

of
all
these
question
there

wasn
t

this

how
long
would
it

how

it
it
would

something
to

there

some
of
the
participant
have
brought
their
partner
there
be
also
the
chance
to
play
roulette
but
i
suppose
that
buying
nokia
share
that
even
would
have
be
a
well
bet
and
many
people
certainly
do
buy

then
and
do
well
out
of
them
my
turn
come
the
follow
morning
i
have
go
through
the
issue
with
pekka
and
the
other
senior
manager
late
into
the
night
at

news
of
the

warn
and
the
consequent
fall
in
the

price
have
spread
from
table
to
table
like
a
small
bush
fire
in
the
morning
everyone
in
the
hall
could
see
from
my
expression
that
i
be
not
at
my
breeziest
i
begin
my
speech
to
the
silent
audience
the
atmosphere
be
tense
ex
pectant
and
perhaps
a
little
fearful
i
don
t
remember
exactly
what
i
say
i
didn
t
smile
but
i
do
make
clear
what
i
expect
from
those
responsible
for
the
mess
we
be
in
which
be
all
of
us
we
have
fail
together
now
it
s
important
to
analyze
why
this
happen
we
can
t
keep
on
have
to
pub
licly
revise
our
expect
result
i
say
i
list
all
our
problem
or
rather
i
list
all
the
problem
that
pekka
and
i
have
identify
our
forecast
for
u
s
sale
be
go
through
the
floor
the
best
product
we
ve
ever
design
isn
t
reach
the
shelf
because
we
can
t
get
the
com
ponents
to
make
it
our
financial
management
system
might
as
well
use
roman
numeral
for
all
the
good
they
be
we
have
to
find
a
well
balance
between
our
rush
for
growth
and
our
ability
to
satisfy
it
the
silence
continued
we
all
knew
it
be
unfair
for
nokia
and
for
all
of
us
as
individual
that
this
should
happen
now
when
the
outlook
be
so
promising
but
nobody
have
see
that
promising
outlook
because
everything
be
in
such
a
mess
in
fact
our
affair
be
in
such
a
mess
that
our
reporting

be
unable
to
tell
us
how
deep
a
mess
we

capital
our
cash
flow
be
negative
and
dispose
of
our
consumer
electronics
operation
be
cost
us
a
hefty
sum
we
have
to
get
the
investor
both
finnish
and
international
to
calm
down
as
if
god
have
stumble
read
the
headline
in
helsingin
sanomat
fin
land
s
large
daily
newspaper
in
its
story
about
nokia
and
its
pr
there
be
other
headline
the
great
deception
a
strange
affair
and
communi
cation
catastrophe
finnish
investor
be
particularly
angry
because
the
profit
warn
have
be
give
after
trading
on
the
helsinki
stock
exchange
have
end
for
the
day
just
as
it
be
begin
in
new
york
but
we
want
to
look
after
our
international
investor
because
they
be
become
ever
more
important
to
us
i
couldn
t
help
smile
at
the
bad
headline
when
i
remember
the
enthusiasm
with
which
finnish
investor
have
try
to
shed
their
investment
in
nokia
even
before
the
good
year
of
now
they
seem
even
keener
to
do
the
same
thing
and
that
be
the
bad
mistake
an
investor
could
have
make
in
december
nokia
be
now
on
sale
at
a
reduce
price
those
who
bought
share
would
do
well
when
real
profit
resume
i
knew
we
would
soon
be
back
on
track

against
all
odds
i
couldn
t
say
for
sure
how
long
that
would
take
but
we
would
get
thing
straight
it
be
just
a
pity
that
on
that
gloomy
day
december
i
found
it
hard
to
find
anyone
to
believe
me
the
medium
have
attack
me
with
a
sledgehammer
and
the
investor
be
demand
well
explanation
than
they
have
so
far
receive
i
either
have
to
give
new
explanation
or
to
repeat
my
earlier
one
we
decide
to
set
up
a
conference
call
with
international
investor
that
friday
even
it
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
phone
conversation
of
my
career
i
try
to
be
as
clear
and
consistent
as
i
could
be
i
say
i
have
warn
of
a
weaken
in
the
market
for
television
in
europe
back
in
october
at
that
time
nokia
have
publish
its
result
for
the
first
eight
month
i
say
that
precise
information
on
the
market
s
impact
on
nokia
have
become
available
only
on
thursday
that
be
when
the
company
s
board
have
discuss
the
matter
before
agree
that
i
should
issue
the
profit
warn
we
have
told
the
investor
as
soon
as
possible
i
explain
that
the
consumer
electronics
management
team
have
change
i
promise
also
that
consumer
electronics
would
cause
no
far
disappointment
for
investor
the
follow
year
i
told
investor
that
our
earlier
forecast
for
the
u
s
market
for
mobile
phone
have
in
fact
be
rather
more
pessimistic
than
our
current
one
our
difficul
tie
be
the
result
of
grow
pain
we
hadn
t
receive
all
the
component
we
have
need
when
and
where
we
need
them
which
be
why
growth
and
profitability
hadn
t
developed
as
we
have
hop
i
felt
that
i
have
manage
to
extinguish
the
bad
fire
at
least
neverthe
less
the
honesty
or
at
least
the
consistency
of
the
information
i
have
give
out
be
call
into
question
for
the
first
time
that
seem
to
me
unfair
wrong
and
even
repugnant
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
would
have
thought
the
same
way
if
i
have
be
an
international
investor
ollila
go
on
and
on
explain
but
what
he
say
be
quite
different
from
what
he
say
a
month
ago
perhaps
he
doesn
t
know
where
his
company
be
head
can
we
really
trust
him
as
chief
executive
be
what
i
might
have
say
there
would
have
be
many
good
reason
for
say
it
we
found
out
that
the
mobile
phone
component
have
be
travel
the
world
over
more
or
less
at
random
for
example
we
have
order
part
from
one
supplier
in
hong
kong
but
it
turn
out
that
they
be
in
korea
and
weren
t
what
we
be
look
for
anyway
when
we
try
to
buy
a
far
batch
of
half
a
million
the
price
rise
astronomically
production
slow
down
and
our
budgeting
fell
to
bit
we
have
stealthily
grown
into
a
global
company
but
we
lack
a
global
company
s
logistics
and
efficiency
no
company
and
least
of
all
a
major
global
company
can
operate
without
proper
process
it
may
have
the
cleverest
and
most
wonderful
people
on
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
earth
but
it
need
process
if
it
grows
rapidly
those
process
must
grow
with
it
in
major
company
at
least
three
thing
be
in
circulation
money
material
and
information
if
they
don
t
circulate
at
the
same
pace
the
com
pany
be
at
risk
as
nokia
be
in
about
a
week
after
the
profit
warn
pekka
ala
pietil
and
i
discuss
thing
in
my
office
christmas
be
just
a
few
day
away
but
we
hadn
t
spent
much
time
on
our
christmas
preparation
do
you
have
any
idea
what
the
result
for
december
will
be
like
i
ask
pekka
they
could
even
be
slightly
bad
than
november
s
though
not
much
bad
pekka
reply
a
little
uncertainly
in
november
we
have
just
make
a
profit
though
not
much
look
we
ve
get
two
or
three
month
come
up
where
we
ll
make
a
loss
have
you
have
a
chance
to
consider
that
at
all
i
say
pekka
be
quiet
for
a
moment
and
look
at
his
paper
yes
that
could
happen
but
i
haven
t
really
thought
about
it
he
say
my
information
be
in
no
way
well
than
pekka
s
we
be
in
the
same
boat
as
far
as
real
figure
and
real
profit
forecast
be
concerned
perhaps
my
uncompromising
nature
make
me
wonder
what
the
bad
that
could
happen
would
be
when
thing
start
to
go
badly
you
don
t
want
to
think
how
they
could
get
bad
it
s
natural
accept
a
loss
be
psychologically
difficult
especially
when
thing
have
go
well
after
just
one
month
of
lose
money
almost
every
chief
executive
will
try
to
find
at
least
some
positive
signal
that
say
the
next
month
will
be
well
over
the
christmas
break
i
thought
hard
about
everything
we
need
to
do
the
most
difficult
decision
of
my
career
on
nokia
s
internal
organiza
tion
await
me
and
it
seem
to
us
that
nokia
face
at
least
one
full
year
of
hell

against
all
odds
chapter
who
be
to
blame
t
here
be
many
reason
that
nokia
collide
with
a
brick
wall
the
complete
picture
take
several
month
to
become
clear
during
which
my
pessimistic
prediction
of
far
loss
be
borne
out
the
five
try
to
discover
what
the
real
problem
be
sit
far
into
the
night
in
the
gloomy
head
office
we
often
begin
our
meeting
at
eight
o
clock
on
sunday
evening
and
carry
on
until
we
ran
out
of
steam
the
picture
begin
to
become
clearer
we
couldn
t
discus
everything
in
that
group
as
nokia
s
chief
executive
it
be
my
job
to
determine
who
have
be
responsible
for
this
mess
then
i
have
to
decide
what
to
do
next
these
be
matter
that
a
company
chief
can
never
delegate
or
avoid
the
organization
expect
someone
to
make
the
de
cisions
and
set
the
direction
while
show
how
the
company
deal
with
failure
as
i
ran
through
the
alternative
i
knew
that
my
decision
would
set
a
precedent
never
before
have
we
fail
as
badly
as
we
do
in
the
autumn
of
of
course
nokia
have
fail
even
more
dramatically
in
make
the
investment
it
do
in
the
s
but
an
earlier
generation
of
leader
have
be
responsible
then
now
we
have
to
be
pathologically
precise
in
investigate
the
cause
of
our
failure
learn
from
it
and
put
the
company
back
on
track
on
this
we
be
all
agree
a
manage
director
or
a
chief
executive
can
never
run
a
company
over
the
head
of
the
next
most
senior
people
because
that
would
damage
the
credibility
of
both
the
individual
and
the
organization
the
people
in
charge
of
division
have
to
gain
experience
of
the
freedom
and
responsibility
that
make
an
inseparable
pair
in
develop
the
business
chief
executive
must
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
trust
the
senior
manager
they
work
with
in
all
circumstance
because
ulti
mately
those
executive
be
responsible
for
the
company
s
result
they
re
responsible
to
investor
to
the
board
to
the
medium
to
the
em
ployees
and
of
course
to
themselves
one
of
the
more
difficult
element
of
the
chief
executive
s
job
be
to
be
responsible
for
everything
while
lack
the
practical
power
essential
to
run
the
company
the
chief
executive
run
the
company
through
its
senior
manager
by
be
an
example
create
process
make
appointment
and
develop
a
leadership
culture
on
top
of
all
that
a
chief
executive
have
to
know
as
much
as
possible
about
the
company
its
product
and
its
prospect
the
good
news
and
especially
the
bad
news
there
be
certainly
some
strong
individual
in
nokia
s
management
team
all
of
them
have
be
use
to
success
since
their
early
year
i
have
personally
select
each
and
every
member
of
my
senior
team
because
that
s
one
of
the
key
task
of
a
chief
executive
thus
i
be
responsible
to
the
people
to
whom
i
answer
for
what
those
team
member
do
if
one
of
them
be
criticize
it
be
a
criticism
of
me
too
that
be
only
fair
i
couldn
t
explain
to
the
board
that
it
be
someone
else
s
fault
that
the
company
have
fail
the
board
would
only
ask
me
why
that
person
be
in
that
position
who
be
responsible
for
that
appointment
that
would
have
be
easy
to
answer
direct
responsibility
for
mobile
phone
actually
sat
with
pekka
ala
pi
etil
he
take
the
responsibility
for
the
failure
of
his
sector
now
i
have
to
decide
how
that
responsibility
should
be
discharge
in
practice
i
have
myself
put
pekka
in
charge
of
mobile
phone
pekka
be
my
man
i
have
take
great
risk
in
trust
to
pekka
s
ability
but
those
risk
have
show
themselves
to
be
justified
also
i
need
pekka
to
help
develop
my
own
idea
he
comple
mented
my
think
with
his
analytical
approach
and
his
optimism
pekka
believe
the
best
about
people
even
when
i
wasn
t
quite
so
sure
myself
we
have
grown
together
become
exceptionally
close
colleague
along
the
way
if
nokia
have
be
an
american
company
the
decision
would
have
be
clear
pekka
would
have
have
to
pack
his
bag
and
clear
his
desk
in
the
middle
of
december
after
the
first
profit
warn
in
the
united
state
the
chief
ex
ecutive
be
responsible
to
the
investor
for
everything
and
in
every
respect
if
the
company
fails
someone
s
head
must
be
offer
up
both
as
a
warn
to
other
executive
and
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
investor
conversely
in
european
company
manager
be
allow
to
carry
on
regardless
of
how
many
fail
ures
happen
on
their
watch
now
i
have
to
decide
which
road
nokia
would
take
and
thereby
what
its
leadership
culture
would
be
the
board
the
inves

against
all
odds
tor
the
workforce
and
the
medium
all
await
my
decision
it
be
one
of
the
most
important
of
my
career
i
spent
december
think
it
through
i
also
discuss
thing
at
home
with
liisa
who
worried
how
much
of
all
this
i
could
take
the
external
pressure
be
tremendous
nokia
have
many
international
shareholder
who
be
use
to
see
a
company
s
senior
manager
in
per
son
when
there
be
trouble
the
medium
would
certainly
doubt
my
decision
make
capacity
if
nothing
happen
the
medium
onslaught
have
begin
al
ready
and
in
the
new
year
it
would
only
become
more
intense
some
people
thought
that
the
chief
executive
should
resign
after
christmas
i
make
up
my
mind
pekka
ala
pietil
would
keep
his
job
his
most
important
task
be
about
to
begin
he
would
spend
the
next
few
month
sort
out
the
mess
nokia
have
get
itself
into
i
also
decide
that
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
would
become
a
temporary
member
of
the
team
that
ran
our
mobile
phone
operation
his
job
be
to
monitor
product
develop
ment
and
to
provide
financial
acumen
from
above
it
must
have
look
as
if
he
be
act
as
my
eye
and
ear
in
pekka
s
team
in
fact
i
trust
pekka
s
reporting
but
i
also
want
to
ensure
that
his
unit
would
get
everything
straight
i
decide
that
the
responsibility
for
all
this
would
rest
with
pekka
and
me
when
we
met
after
christmas
we
agree
that
pekka
would
withdraw
from
all
public
activity
he
would
scrub
from
his
calendar
everything
uncon
nected
with
this
firefighting
he
would
be
give
the
chance
to
raise
his
unit
from
the
ash
we
agree
that
i
would
accept
any
and
all
public
criticism
for
as
long
as
it
take
to
put
thing
straight
that
would
give
pekka
the
breath
ing
space
he
need
to
get
thing
back
into
shape
it
be
important
to
send
two
signal
to
nokia
internally
earlier
i
say
that
you
could
make
mistake
in
nokia
though
no
one
be
to
make
the
same
mistake
twice
if
i
have
gotten
rid
of
pekka
i
would
have
go
against
my
own
principle
of
leadership
mistake
be
for
learn
from
very
few
people
in
a
company
will
make
mistake
consciously
or
from
bad
faith
we
make
this
mistake
because
we
didn
t
understand
what
our
rate
of
growth
demand
from
the
company
and
from
us
my
message
to
everyone
work
for
nokia
be
that
we
have
indeed
make
a
mistake
but
that
we
weren
t
play
a
blame
game
it
be
a
message
that
the
next
eight
month
be
a
serious
test
of
how
pekka
s
organization
could
be
knock
back
into
shape
if
pekka
and
his
team
didn
t
succeed
i
would
have
to
look
at
thing
afresh
but
i
be
confident
that
pekka
and
his
team
would
get
thing
straight
i
really
didn
t
have
much
choice
when
i
make
my
deci
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
sion
i
couldn
t
give
special
attention
to
run
one
particular
unit
because
that
would
have
be
a
misuse
of
a
chief
executive
s
position
and
time
i
give
the
responsibility
to
the
people
whose
responsibility
it
be
but
that
didn
t
mean
i
be
indifferent
as
to
the
outcome
i
have
intensive
conversation
with
pekka
we
met
one
on
one
and
as
part
of
the
management
team
i
spoke
to
him
at
great
length
i
know
that
period
be
very
difficult
for
pekka
i
be
certainly
partly
guilty
of
make
it
so
i
want
to
use
every
possible
mean
to
ensure
that
this
mistake
would
not
be
fatal
to
us
or
to
nokia
i
be
paranoid
in
my
search
for
weak
point
in
pe
kka
s
plan
and
i
continually
demand
additional
information
from
him
i
be
hard
on
him
just
as
i
be
hard
on
myself
too
i
be
demand
the
impossible
but
pekka
already
knew
to
expect
that
he
knew
me
but
i
never
criticize
him
publicly
we
discuss
thing
together
and
i
want
him
to
know
that
i
wouldn
t
let
go
of
the
matter
until
i
knew
we
be
back
in
calm
water
in
january
we
agree
that
there
be
really
only
one
person
who
could
ensure
that
we
do
reach
those
calm
water
pertti
korhonen
he
be
the
best
person
to
extricate
nokia
from
its
difficulty
his
power
of
organiza
tion
experience
and
optimism
be
an
absolutely
unbeatable
combination
pertti
s
task
would
be
to
create
a
mechanism
robust
enough
to
withstand
the
fast
growth
which
would
bring
everything
together
into
one
chain
of
process
everything
would
be
integrate
from
product
development
and
design
through
the
procurement
of
component
and
on
to
manufacturing
and
even
marketing
this
be
no
small
challenge
and
pertti
want
a
little
time
to
think
he
have
some
difficulty
with
the
idea
he
have
run
an
orga
nization
of
three
to
four
thousand
people
but
now
he
would
become
some
peculiar
one
man
band
it
wouldn
t
look
very
good
either
inside
nokia
or
in
the
press
it
would
look
as
if
a
successful
young
manager
have
be
push
to
the
sideline
there
be
another
problem
too
which
make
pertti
hesitate
he
didn
t
understand
anything
at
all
about
logistics
but
that
wasn
t
a
big
worry
for
pekka
or
me
good
nokia
people
that
we
be
we
believe
that
pertti
would
soon
learn
all
he
need
to
we
have
set
up
a
reliable
process
for
manufacturing
mobile
phone
and
we
could
make
large
batch
efficiently
but
that
wasn
t
enough
we
still
lack
control
system
that
could
tell
our
factory
what
they
should
produce
and
by
when
what
component
be
need
and
in
what
number
and
where
the
stage
be
set
for
an
internal
battle
the
production
people
say
that
the
marketing
people
should
be
able
to
forecast
what
sort
of
phone
would
be
need
the
marketing
people
say
what
they
thought
demand
would
be

against
all
odds
liisa
and
me
with
intel
president
and
ceo
craig
barret
and
his
wife
barbara
in
sun
valley
in
intel
be
a
nokia
supplier
as
early
as
the
s
barbara
later
become
the
u
s
ambassador
to
finland
but
the
phone
stayed
in
the
warehouse
when
demand
shift
to
another
model
but
that
other
phone
the
one
customer
do
want
to
buy
wasn
t
in
the
warehouse
it
be
a
big
mess
its
root
didn
t
lie
in
the
company
s
stratus
fied
structure
so
much
as
at
its
very
center
it
sat
at
the
center
of
every
west
ern
company
for
decade
now
every
company
have
believe
in
organization
by
function
a
company
will
have
a
production
division
a
sale
division
and
many
other
division
and
each
have
its
own
job
to
do
that
s
why
it
s
call
organization
by
function
this
system
work
splendidly
when
development
be
proceed
ing
smoothly
when
the
market
for
your
product
aren
t
grow
too
fast
everyone
know
what
their
job
be
also
the
company
can
make
it
clear
what
it
expect
each
division
to
do
otherwise
individual
division
will
start
to
pursue
their
own
interest
for
example
use
machinery
at
full
capacity
be
the
most
important
thing
for
one
of
our
production
manager
who
have
be
train
in
japan
that
make
production
efficient
because
it
minimize
the
unit
cost
of
every
mobile
phone
the
essence
of
efficiency
but
the
manager
in
question
wasn
t
at
all
interested
in
whether
he
be
make
phone
that
would
sell
or
phone
that
would
stay
on
the
shelf
from
nokia
s
viewpoint
it
be
well
for
the
sort
of
phone
that
stay
on
the
shelf
to
remain
unmade
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
these
be
point
that
pertti
quickly
identify
but
the
full
picture
of
the
catastrophe
only
become
clear
a
little
at
a
time
we
understood
that
the
problem
lay
with
our
process
though
we
have
also
suffer
from
problem
with
the
supply
of
component
and
from
unreliable
business
partner
be
fore
christmas
it
be
clear
to
us
there
be
problem
with
charger
provide
by
a
norwegian
company
most
of
them
function
perfectly
well
but
some
of
them
cause
a
short
circuit
when
you
try
to
use
them
the
ca
ing
turn
into
a
hot
grey
mass
of
plastic
eventually
you
would
be
left
with
two
pin
stick
out
of
the
wall
socket
ready
to
electrocute
any
passing
adult
child
or
pet
it
be
no
wonder
that
u
s
official
responsible
for
prod
uct
safety
demand
that
we
do
something
we
be
ever
more
dependent
on
our
supplier
although
they
make
the
part
we
bore
the
responsibility
if
anything
go
wrong
later
we
learn
more
about
this
dependence
we
also
have
to
work
with
our
supplier
to
improve
our
process
our
entire
organization
be
run
at
full
throttle
pekka
ala
pietil
hardly
slept
at
night
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
travel
to
sort
out
our
problem
pertti
korhonen
put
all
his
energy
into
work
out
what
we
have
gotten
ourselves
into
and
how
we
could
get
out
again
he
too
shuttle
be
tween
our
factory
our
supplier
and
our
sale
unit
i
have
at
least
manage
to
instill
the
feel
that
nokia
face
a
crisis
after
he
shuttle
around
the
world
pertti
begin
to
understand
where
our
problem
lay
nokia
s
distribution
center
around
the
world
be
full
of
stock
that
have
fail
to
sell
pertti
have
see
vast
reserve
of
phone
on
his
trip
we
wonder
what
we
could
have
gotten
for
the
money
tie
up
in
these
phone
how
many
mile
of
motorway
how
many
jumbo
jet
would
we
have
be
able
to
buy
have
we
tie
up
all
the
money
from
our
listing
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
the
previous
year
in
these
phone
that
no
one
want
we
have
indeed
do
just
that
as
i
listen
to
pertti
s
account
an
impotent
fury
course
through
my
vein
once
more
i
want
to
rage
at
someone
but
the
only
rightful
target
for
my
wrath
be
me
pertti
korhonen
be
work
without
preconception
because
he
wasn
t
familiar
with
our
old
work
method
he
knew
only
that
it
be
his
job
to
save
nokia
so
he
could
look
at
nokia
s
logistics
with
a
clear
eye
first
he
have
to
establish
in
his
own
mind
what
exactly
lay
at
the
heart
of
the
problem
when
he
have
make
thing
clear
to
himself
it
would
be
easy
for
him
to
talk
to
others
about
them

against
all
odds
chapter
turn
weakness
into
strength
b
efore
i
hadn
t
encounter
failure
on
a
massive
scale
at
nokia
i
have
be
a
success
in
the
finance
department
although
the
entire
company
be
in
ruin
i
have
create
the
condition
for
success
when
i
be
in
charge
of
mobile
phone
later
i
have
take
charge
of
nokia
when
the
company
face
formidable
risk
and
failure
be
a
real
possibility
i
be
unsure
how
to
set
about
turn
the
whole
of
nokia
around
in
the
spring
of
but
i
succeed
nonetheless
the
event
of
be
like
a
bad
dream
a
nightmare
even
that
should
never
have
occur
in
fact
the
nightmare
seem
to
go
on
and
on
get
scarier
all
the
time
i
have
give
pekka
pertti
and
their
team
eight
to
nine
month
to
sort
thing
out
i
have
steel
myself
to
consider
pekka
s
position
again
after
six
month
if
he
didn
t
succeed
i
would
have
to
remove
him
that
would
be
hard
but
unavoidable
i
put
pressure
on
pekka
i
kept
him
up
to
the
mark
and
i
spur
him
on
and
i
support
him
i
use
every
mean
at
my
disposal
some
of
these
be
agreeable
enough
but
i
kept
on
at
him
like
an
angry
dog
that
wouldn
t
let
go
i
trust
him
but
i
also
want
to
be
sure
i
be
do
my
own
bit
i
do
everything
i
could
for
him
and
of
course
for
nokia
and
for
myself
we
owe
that
to
the
company
and
to
all
our
employee
we
couldn
t
let
them
down
we
couldn
t
be
allow
to
fail
as
far
as
the
press
be
concerned
we
have
pretty
much
fail
already
and
they
have
good
reason
to
think
that
at
the
end
of
february
we
issue
our
result
for
the
whole
of
our
profit
have
grown
by
percent
but
they
be
small
than
the
analyst
have
forecast
all
the
growth
be
down
to
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
our
telecommunication
division
which
have
generate
over
half
our
profit
the
profit
from
mobile
phone
stayed
much
as
it
have
be
and
consumer
electronics
do
little
to
make
the
figure
look
well
we
also
announce
that
we
be
finally
get
out
of
television
production
altogether
i
warn
that
our
result
for
would
be
weaker
i
explain
that
competition
in
tele
communication
would
reduce
our
profit
and
would
also
affect
our
profit
from
mobile
phone
my
profit
warn
didn
t
please
the
investor
our
share
value
sank
like
a
stone
in
the
course
of
six
month
nokia
share
lose
nearly
half
their
value
it
wasn
t
an
achievement
i
m
go

in

in

even
so
nokia
s
result
be
the
best
in
its
history
they
have
grown
by
nearly
percent
in
a
year
our
share
of
the
mobile
phone
market
have
risen
from
percent
to
percent
we
have
almost
double
our
sale
of
mobile
phone
from
million
to
million
but
that
be
still
million
less
than
our
budget
have
forecast
the
world
be
become
an
extraordinary
place
i
reflect
i
couldn
t
think
of
any
precedent
for
the
sort
of
busi
ness
we
be
do
we
have
fail
but
we
be
still
grow
at
an
immense
speed
the
pace
of
change
be
so
fast
that
we
could
never
have
predict
how
it
would
change
even
if
we
have
dare
to
try
besides
the
press
brought
us
back
to
earth
on
friday
march
the
finan
cial
time
which
i
have
always
held
in
high
regard
publish
a
story
that
hit
home
harder
than
anything
before
i
have
become
inure
to
the
comment
of
the
finnish
press
which
be
often
weak
on
analysis
i
have
a
thick
skin
as
far
as
they
be
concerned
nokia
be
already
too
big
for
finland
it
be
an
excellent
target
for
journalist
who
want
to
let
their
feeling
spill
out
as
long
as
they
could
find
a
little
material
on
which
to
base
a
story
i
found
the
criticism
of
the
international
press
much
more
to
the
point
the
financial
time
have
publish
a
story
under
the
headline
nokia
say
goodbye
to
the
golden
day
it
point
out
that
i
have
issue
two
profit
warning
in
the
course
of
three
month
and
that
the
company
s
share
value
have
fall
by
percent
in
light
of
these
fact
it
say
nokia
s
sensational
run
as
one
of
the
best
technology
share
seem
to
be
come
to
an
end
the
paper
say
that
the
late
profit
warn
confirm
the
view
that
at
the
very
least
the
com
pany
face
some
intractable
problem
the
big
question
be
whether
nokia
can
return
to
form
this
year
it
write
i
receive
the
paper
at
the
office
that
friday
morning
i
felt
gloomy
as
i
read
it
apart
from
everything
else
the
question
touch
on
my
reputation

against
all
odds
my
pride
my
ability
i
decide
to
show
the
financial
time
that
we
would
succeed
again
and
well
than
before
that
year
be
surely
one
of
the
most
important
in
nokia
s
history
it
look
to
me
as
if
we
be
fight
on
every
front
at
first
we
seem
to
be
sustain
loss
in
every
battle
but
as
the
year
s
end
approach
we
begin
to
see
glimpse
of
victory
pekka
ala
pietil
pertti
korhonen
and
their
team
succeed
nokia
s
production
and
distribution
have
be
reconfigured
earlier
our
factory
have
make
product
for
which
we
have
to
find
customer
now
we
make
only
those
product
for
which
we
knew
there
be
a
demand
the
whole
organiza
tion
knew
that
nokia
held
far
too
much
stock
which
tie
up
far
too
much
money
now
our
ware
wouldn
t
lie
around
in

they
would
be
sell
much
more
quickly
and
efficiently

to
move
out

take
an
external
viewpoint
doesn
t
mean
amateurishness
because
every
outsider
should
learn
how
to
do

properly
ultimately
the
question
be
down
to
the
indi
vidual
if
people
be
endow
with
boldness
curiosity
and
the
right
degree
of
responsibility
they
can
move
from

another
without
serious

the

it

difficult

out

where
you

when
thing

go
so
well
but
there
be
at

two
reason
that
a
company
must
push
people
to
take
risk
to
its
limit
when
the
company
be
in

solution

hardly

to
emerge
from
inside
the
comfort
zone
but
will
by
defini
tion
be
high
risk
and
the
organization
have
to
recognize
and
understand
that
the
company
be
indeed
in
crisis
this
knowledge
shouldn
t
lead
people

it
should
act
as
a
powerful
motivator
for

between
these
two
despair
and
a
desire
for
transformation
the
difference

only

it

even
so
our

perhaps
we
should
focus
more
on

nokia

network
business
and
its
mobile

business
have
long
be
separate
but
in
practice
this
wasn
t
a
black
and
white
distinction
we
have
to
understand
our
customer
whether
they
be
individual
who
want
to
buy
a
mobile
phone
or
operating
company
that
bought

for

in

we

half
our

to
the

who
sell
them
on
to

customer
through
their

channel
we
try
to

so
that

would
want
to
buy
them
and
the

would
have
to
stock
them
the

in
our
internal
discussion
be
often
the
division
that
hap
pen
to
be

so
our
mobile

operation
have
to
re
spond
to
internal
criticism
at
the
heart
of
the
discussion

sometime
in

very
jorma

in

none
of
the
rest
of
you
apart
from

know
enough
about
this
business
and
even
jorma
s
experience
doesn
t
go
back
very
far
say
pekka
rather
indignantly
which
be
unusual
for
him
these
discussion
never
become
part
of
nokia
s
formal
strategic
planning
even
so
they
say
something
about
the
uncertainty
that
the
year
brought
us
and
about
the
real
quest
that
be
under
way
we
couldn
t
produce
mobile
phone
without
regard
to
the
operator
wish
or
empathy
for
their
con
cerns
but
in
no
circumstance
would
we
give
up
our
own
brand
to
become
solely
a
manufacturer
of
generic
product
with
some
operator
s
label
stuck
on
the
case
we
have
succeed
in
grow
the
value
of
our
brand
on
the
global
market
we
weren
t
at
the
top
yet
but
we
be
well
on
the
way
we
be
lieved
we
would
be
able
to
exploit
technical
advance
to
make
well
phone
that
do
innovative
thing
we
have
a
chance
to
become
the
world
s
lead
mobile
phone
company
for
that
we
need
the
will
hard
work
good
deci
sion
and
it
must
be
say
a
certain
degree
of
good
luck
we
do
draw
on
outside
help
in
develop
our
own
think
for
exam
ple
in
we
organize
a
future
seminar
on
mobile
phone
we
invite
the
highly
regard
gary
hamel
a
management
guru
whose
name
be
know
to
every
business
student
the
seminar
generate
a
fat
file
of
new
idea
that
we
drew
on
for
year
afterwards
my
own
decision
be
that
we
should
continue
our
twin
track
approach
we
would
continue
to
develop
our
own
brand
our
own
technology
and
well
mobile
product
aim
directly
at
our
customer
nokia
would
also
become
a
company
that
developed
both
industrial
production
and
software
we
would
listen
very
closely
to
our
customer
among
the
operating
compa
ny
because
so
much
of
our
turnover
depend
on
them
thus
end
this
phase
of
introspection
at
nokia
but
i
knew
that
what
i
have
decide
be
easy
say
than
do
we
soon
have
other
reason
for
introspection
the
world
be
change
without
ask
nokia
s
permission
we
have
to
evolve
rapidly
but
in
which
direction
in
many
respect
nokia
be
at
the
eye
of
a
storm
if
we
make
the
right
decision
we
would
get
wind
in
our
sail
but
if
we
fail
the
storm
would
consign
us
to
the
deep
along
with
other
forgotten
shipwreck
com
panies
there
wasn
t
much
time
to
make
the
right
decision
and
no
one
have
enough
information
about
what
the
future
might
have
in
store
for
technol
ogy
company
in
the
s
nor
do
we
know
how
our
customer
would
behave
whether
they
be
in
europe
asia
or
north
america
but
we
would
have
to
find
out
if
we
be
to
survive
the
come
onslaught
we
also
have
to
create
our
own
momentum
to
carry
us
forward

to

standard
should
be
universal
after
that
it
be
up
to
the
operator
to
compete
by
offering
the
best
possible
service
so
a
swedish
girl
could
call
home
as
easily
from
a
holiday
in
spain
as
when
she
have
popped
out
to
the
shop
in
stockholm
in
the
united
state
she
might
not
be
able
to
speak
to
someone
in
the
next
state
in
the
spring
of
the
u
s
government
held
an
auction
of
license
for
mobile
phone
operator
it
be
up
to
the
operator
which
standard
they
ad
opt
nokia
s
chief
technology
officer
yrj
neuvo
and
i
go
around
to
many
american
operator
and
try
to
persuade
them
of
the
excellence
of
the
gsm
standard
i
can
t
say
we
be
very
successful
gsm
become
only
the
third
most
popular
of
the
standard
on
offer
that
be
why
the
united
state
lag
far
behind
europe
and
japan
when
new
mobile
service
be
developed
at
the
end
of
the
s
in
europe
gsm
be
already
an
important
standard
which
suit
nokia
completely
we
want
the
next
generation
of
mobile
phone
to
take
gsm
as
its
start
point
a
battle
begin
in
that
the
press
later
characterize
as
nokia
s
first

war
our
goal
be
ambitious
we
want
the
world
to
adopt
a
mobile
phone
standard
that
would
put
our
own
product
in
a
strong
position
and
of
course
we
also
believe
that
such
a
standard
would
be
best
for
consumer
in
europe
we
decide
to
form
a
nordic
alliance
with
our
swedish

earlier

do
we
do
so
because
we

also
because

be
keen

try
something

from

it
be

worth

because
we

with

it
s
always
easy
to
say
that

this
compel
finland
to
overhaul
its

and
its

i

with
the

i
met
aho
in
january
immediately
after
my
appointment
as
chief
executive
of

i
told
him
that
the
company
have
have
difficulty
which
we
would
overcome
because
the
core
business
be
sound
we
could
build
our
future
use
our
own
resource
nokia
would
never
ask
the
government
for
money
what
we
want
be
for
the
government
to
create
a
business
environment
where
company
like
ours
could
thrive
i
also
stress
that
i
would
do
my
best
to
support
him
because
a
thrive
finland
be
absolutely
crucial
for
nokia
at
this
time
there
be
a
vigorous
debate
on
increase
the
resource
de
vote
to
research
and
development
the
government
propose
a
target
of
percent
of

by
the
end
of
the

this
be
confirm
by

science
and
technology
policy
council
for
finland
which
include
representative
from
business
university
and
research
institute
as
well
as
the
key
min
istries
the
government
undertook
to
provide
a
percent
share
with
the
private
sector
cover
the
remain
percent
they
both
have
to
sharply
increase
their
investment
in
research
and
development
and
we
weren
t
talk

against
all
odds
ing
of
small
sum
of
money
there
be
much
skepticism
in
official
circle
but
overall
the
target
be
reach
by
the
private
sector
s
share
be
percent
and
the
state
s
contribution
be
also
significantly
high
than

in

high
tech
company
in
the
early
autumn
of
nokia
s
long
logistical
crisis
seem
to
be
come
to
its
end
but
an
entirely
new
sort
of
problem
be
now
on
the
agen
da
would
finland
continue
to
be
the
right
place
for
nokia
to
have
its
head
office
or
indeed
for
nokia
in
general
the
question
have
be
float
around
since
the
late
s
but
not
in
any
very
serious
way
in
the
early
s
when
nokia
be
rapidly
become
more
international
there
have
be
lot
of
little
practical
issue
that
might
have
be
resolve
more
easily
elsewhere
and
discussion
over
the
location
of
the
head
office
gather
pace
many
people
thought
that
if
nokia
do
indeed
become
a
successful
major
international
company
it
be
inevitable
that
the
head
office
and
perhaps
other
function
would
have
to
relocate
speculation
always
seem
to
heighten
in
the
medium
as
well
as
within
the
company
when
result
and
growth
rate
be
good
and
it
would
fall
back
once
again
when
everyday
problem
press
down
or
result
didn
t
live
up
to
expectation
at
the
end
of
october
i
summon
the
five
for
a
short
meeting
first
we
ran
through
current
issue
as
we
usually
do
a
snapshot
of
activity
show
that
the
company
as
a
whole
be
perform
well
then
without
any
particular
preparation
i
brought
up
the
question
of
where
the
head
office
should
be
sit
i
note
that
even
though
we
have
survive
our
recent
logisti
cal
crisis
in
mobile
phone
it
be
likely
even
in
the
best
case
scenario
that
in
the
next
five
year
we
would
find
ourselves
in
a
storm
similar
to
the
one
we
have
just
weather
if
we
be
to
emerge
victorious
from
our
current
phase
of
growth
we
need
to
develop
our
leadership
significantly
to
recruit
new
key
individual
and
specialist
to
strengthen
our
global
organization
and
above
all
to
create
a
more
stable
environment
for
development
and
renewal
as
we
have
do
at
the
begin
of
the
decade
all
this
be
already
well
in
hand
but
my
message
be
that
our
effort
need
more
oomph
at
the
same
time
finland
seem
to
be
emerge
from
its
own
economic
problem
its
economic
policy
be
steady
pragmatic
and
successful
nokia
have
a
lot
to
do
in
the
come
year
in
term
of
its
internal
development
there
would
be
no
benefit
for
the
company
if
its
senior
management
spent
its
time
niggle
over
where
to
site
its
head
office
or
other
peripheral
ques
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
tions
we
have
have
quite
enough
of
those
in
recent
year
both
external
and
self
inflict
i
propose
to
my
colleague
that
we
should
not
add
the
question
of
the
location
of
our
head
office
to
our
agenda
but
should
tersely
note
that
nokia
would
remain
in
finland
and
develop
its
operation
on
that
assumption
we
could
come
back
to
the
matter
if
there
be
significant
new
factor
to
consider
and
we
need
to
check
our
basic
approach
i
also
propose
that
i
would
tell
the
prime
minister
and
finance
minister
but
otherwise
we
should
remain
silent
on
the
issue
to
my
surprise
this
didn
t
give
rise
to
much
discussion
and
my
view
re
ceived
a
clear
endorsement
for
my
colleague
it
seem
a
natural
line
to
fol
low
which
apparently
didn
t
even
need
this
much
consideration
for
without
this
discussion
we
would
simply
have
follow
this
line
anyway
it
be
the
default
position
because
there
have
be
so
little
discussion
i
checked
later
with
each
of
the
others
that
they
really
be
happy
with
what
we
d
agree
i
told
both
the
prime
minister
and
finance
minister
toward
the
end
of
that
we
d
decide
to
keep
our
head
office
in
finland
i
add
that
we
also
intend
to
raise
the
proportion
of
the
product
development
that
we
conduct
in
finland
it
be
already
percent
we
have
no
demand
to
make
or
condition
to
impose
and
we
never
would
there
be
just
two
thing
we
hop
to
see
first
that
nokia
would
not
be
punish
for
this
decision
and
that
the
government
for
its
part
would
sincerely
try
to
look
after
the
environment
for
international
company
operating
in
finland
when
they
have
recover
from
their
initial
surprise
both
party
leader
as
they
then
be
grasped
the
magnitude
of
the
request
we
then
have
an
exceptionally
open
discussion
of
what
be
need
if
finland
be
to
become
an
attractive
destination
for
investment
and
business
be
to
be
successful
i
hadn
t
brought
a
wish
list
along
and
i
wouldn
t
have
want
that
sort
of
discussion
since
it
would
have
go
against
the
grain
of
my
principle
i
brought
up
only
one
crucial
point
the
high
level
of
personal
taxation
in
finland
this
didn
t
have
much
direct
impact
on
nokia
but
it
have
a
great
indirect
impact
because
it
affected
the
dynamism
of
the
economy
in
finland
the
high
marginal
rate
of
taxation
have
long
be
a
problem
for
those
move
from
middle
income
into
high
tax
bracket
when
i
discuss
the
issue
with
finnish
engineer
at
nokia
in
there
be
clearly
grow
dissatisfaction
with
the
punitive
tax
progression
i
do
some
simple
sum
base
on
an
engineer
at
salo
who
have
a
wife
and
two
child
these
show
that
when
a
recently
qualify
engineer
s
salary
be
double
his
take
home
pay
rise
by
only
percent
the
high
tax
rate
be
not
the

against
all
odds
only
reason
for
this
other
benefit
such
as
housing
support
be
remove
as
the
salary
increase
the
message
be
clear
it
be
difficult
in
finland
to
motivate
engineer
to
achieve
result
or
aim
for
more
senior
position
because
tax
would
take
almost
all
the
increase
in
salary
just
when
they
be
try
to
start
a
family
for
the
best
engineer
this
be
an
additional
reason
for
seek
work
over
sea
i
discuss
this
several
time
with
the
prime
minister
finance
mini
ter
and
cabinet
secretary
these
long
conversation
brought
result
at
the
start
of
january
at
a
breakfast
meeting
at
the
prime
minister
s
official
residence
i
receive
confirmation
that
the
tax
progression
scale
would
be
revise
and
a
more
rational
system
of
banding
introduce
these
change
would
be
introduce
over
several
year
as
indeed
they
be
this
process
show
that
the
finnish
establishment
be
work
toward
sensible
struc
tural
change
it
also
brought
the
incentive
effect
of
taxation
on
to
the
politi
cal
agenda
the
possible
relocation
of
our
head
office
remain
a
focus
of
interest
at
the
high
level
of
government
in
president
tarja
halonen
ask
me
privately
what
nokia
intend
to
do
regard
its
domicile
the
president
sound
very
concerned
my
understand
be
that
the
head
office
will
re
main
in
finland
i
reply
but
it
s
not
out
of
the
question
that
an
individual
division
might
relocate
abroad
the
late
software
trend
come
chiefly
from
the
united
state
so
we
really
have
to
be
there
in
some
way
we
will
be
very
pragmatic
on
this
point
i
have
always
follow
broader
development
in
society
take
part
in
public
discussion
where
they
touch
on
the
challenge
of
business
life
and
the
problem
that
company
face
i
have
also
take
a
close
interest
in
public
education
at
all
level
many
people
in
finland
have
interpret
this
as
a
de
sire
to
one
day
take
part
in
politics
as
an
elect
representative
i
have
never
show
any
wish
to
do
so
not
even
as
a
remote
possibility
when
i
go
to
study
at
the
london
school
of
economics
in
i
left
behind
an
over
politicize
country
with
an
emergency
government
though
it
felt
good
to
come
back
to
finland
my
decision
be
clear
i
have
return
to
pursue
a
business
career
life
in
political
circle
have
absolutely
no
appeal
in
may
the
finance
minister
want
to
have
a
confidential
talk
with
me
and
we
met
in
a
private
room
at
the
palace
restaurant
i
recall
a
fine
view
over
the
helsinki
market
square
and
the
onion
dome
of
the
orthodox
cathedral
the
minister
hop
i
would
consider
become
the
conservative
candidate
for
president
his
idea
be
that
the
centre
party
might
also
put
its
weight
behind
me
and
that
i
would
emerge
as
an
unbeatable
bourgeois
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
candidate
in
finland
presidential
candidate
stand
as
individual
but
with
support
from
political
party
i
explain
that
i
be
not
available
because
the
previous
year
i
have
undertaken
to
lead
nokia
well
into
the
follow
decade
i
couldn
t
imagine
renege
on
that
obligation
in
november
prime
minister
matti
vanhanen
invite
liisa
and
me
to
dinner
at
his
home
in
his
constituency
about
thirty
mile
from
helsinki
his
wife
have
prepared
a
delicious
meal
and
we
all
get
on
very
well
together
even
if
the
d
cor
wasn
t
entirely
to
our
taste
over
the
dinner
table
we
spoke
mostly
about
international
politics
vanhanen
be
fascinate
to
talk
to
and
both
knowledgeable
and
passionate
about
the
european
union
and
the
oth
er
issue
we
discuss
as
the
even
drew
to
a
close
he
unexpectedly
raise
the
forthcoming
presidential
election
he
note
that
the
centre
party
didn
t
have
a
strong
candidate
and
that
i
ought
to
think
very
seriously
about
stand
ing
i
hadn
t
expect
the
question
but
my
answer
be
ready
it
be
a
clear
no
although
i
be
already
think
of
stand
down
from
the
role
of
chief
executive
i
wasn

ready
even
to
think
about
become
a

we
be
among
the

where
we

want

we

ask
ourselves
five
year
earlier
what
our
goal
should
be
we
be
also
move
into
a
far
phase
of
spectacular
growth
in
we
have
to
think
about
what
be
go
on
around
us
and
how
nokia
should
change
to
reflect
that
we
held
a
few
meeting
of
the
five
at
b
tvik
i
want
us
to
take
seriously
what
be
go
on
the
world
wireless
technology
be
explode
in
front
of
our
eye
the
internet
be
create
a
technological
revolution
and
digital
technology
be
change
everything
what
do
we
believe
in
in
which
area
do
we
want
to
grow
what
should
we
think
about
all
this
how
should
nokia
be
structure
to
face
these
chal
lenges
we
also
have
a
debate
on
whether
nokia
s
future
lay
in
mobile
phone
or
in
network
we
encourage
and
challenged
each
other
some
thought
that
concentrate
on
network
would
suit
nokia
best
they
saw
no
need
for
nokia
to
focus
either
on
medium
or
on
multimedia
the
company
should
stay
in
those
area
it
do
best
that
wasn
t
my
opinion
i
thought
we
should
at
least
play
a
more
active
role
in
develop
internet
technology
i
decide
that
we
would
abandon
one
of
our
old
principle
that
nokia
should
not
seek
growth
through
acquisition
i
have
it
note
in
the
board
minute
in
september
that
acquisition
be
a
possible
but
not
prioritize
mean
of
enhance
nokia
s
structure
nokia
would
be
divide
into
three
part
its
highly
profitable
and
expand
ing
mobile
phone
and
network
business
and
a
little
internet
unit
to
give
us
experience
and
something
to
learn
from
so
we
establish
nokia
venture

against
all
odds
nokia
communicator
beside
the

ny
most
of
them
american
they
never
become
a
large
part
of

in
they
account
for
just
three
percent
of

these
discussion
about
nokia
s
future
direction
be
important
the
peo
ple
in
my
core
group
have
clear
opinion
influence
by
their
background
and
personality
pekka
ala
pietil
and
sari
baldauf
be
particularly
good
at
see
beyond
their
own
narrow
area
and
also
at
pick
up
even
faint
signal
they
be
also
the
most
ready
to
embrace
new
way
of
work
and
change
in
organization
so
pekka
be
the
most
natural
choice
to
manage
the
new
internet
unit
in
we
also
set
ourselves
the
objective
of
stabilize
our
mobile
phone
division
this
meant
that
we
never
want
to
have
another
nightmare
like
the
one
we
live
through
in
i
want
to
ensure
that
our
process
be
in

also
strong
than
we
could
have
imagine
five
year
earlier
but
despite
my
delight
i
still
saw
cause
for
concern
when
i
look
around
i
knew
that
the
most

nothing

chapter
how
to
lead
a
global
nokia
w
e
realize
in
that
at
nokia
we
didn
t
know
enough
about
the
world
we
have
grown
by
accident
into
a
global
company
that
be
now
be
compare
to
other
global
company
we
be
like
a
little
local
team
that
suddenly
find
itself
play
in
the
big
league
i
conclude
that
the
firm
s
top
leadership
should
monitor
and
study
our
most
important
market
thus
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
take
responsibility
for
north
america
and
sari
baldauf
for
asia
which
meant
japan
south
korea
china
hong
kong
and
taiwan
i
want
us
to
know
what
be
go
on
in
these
key
market
i
also
want
regional
viewpoint
to
play
a
more
promi
nent
role
in
our
decision
make
i
want
to
create
a
matrix
system
for
nokia
that
would
ensure
that
a
sub
sidiary
wouldn
t
find
itself
bury
out
of
sight
in
china
or
america
i
want
information
to
flow
from
these
market
back
to
finland
and
conversely
for
nokia
s
strategy
to
take
root
in
those
area
i
m
not
sure
how
well
all
this
actually
work
because
sari
baldauf
and
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
have
only
a
couple
of
year
before
i
reconfigured
the
organization
again
but
i
do
know
that
nokia
would
never
have
gain
a
strong
position
in
china
if
sari
hadn
t
introduce
new
way
of
do
thing
there
change
in
the
market
our
own
growth
and
technological
development
combine
to
force
us
to
consider
our
future
strategy
more
closely
one
of
the
hardest
thing
be
to
communicate
our
strategy
to
our
staff
whose
num
bers
be
grow
by
several
thousand
a
year
we
have
employee
in
and
a
year
later
the
follow
year
nearly
people
join
nokia
we
have
employee
altogether
how
be
some
twenty
five
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
year
old
australian
computer
expert
go
to
learn
anything
about
nokia
s
value
or
strategy
in
his
very
first
proper
job
i
have
no
ready
answer
to
this
but
we
try
to
construct
process
that
would
project
both
our
value
and
our
strategy
and
projection
on
its
own
wasn
t
enough
we
also
have
to
bring
our
employee
along
with
us
so
that
they
would
feel
that
they
could
influ
ence
our
strategy
and
value
in
their
turn
we
open
our
annual
strategy
discussion
by
bring
together
our
four
hundred
most
important
manager
these
meeting
have
originally
have
two
hundred
participant
but
we
expand
that
number
to
reflect
the
company
s
growth
we
ran
through
all
the
most
important
challenge
face
us
these
weren
t
occasion
for
self
congratulation
or
self
satisfied
speech
in
line
with
nokia
s
fine
tradition
these
meeting
be
held
so
that
the
compa
ny
s
leadership
could
hear
in
plain
english
exactly
what
people
thought
we
spoke
of
our
success
and
how
we
have
achieve
them
of
course
but
we
also
home
in
on
thing
we
need
to
do
well
on
these
occasion
finn
be
over
represent
but
the
proportion
of
non
finn
be
grow
rapidly
i
m
not
a
believer
in
great
strategic
theory
or
consultant
for
me
stra
tegic
think
be
very
mundane
work
it
s
a
matter
of
operational
planning
which
have
to
include
a
clear
idea
of
where
we
want
to
be
and
how
we
ll
get
there
a
good
strategy
should
pretty
well
update
itself
automatically
a
strategy
should
also
allow
room
to
make
continuous
adjustment
and
cor
rections
when
nokia
be
grow
fast
at
the
end
of
the
s
we
simply
didn
t
have
time
to
commit
ourselves
to
a
single
rigid
strategy
we
have
to
set
off
without
know
where
we
would
end
up
we
could
work
out
the
exact
route
when
we
be
on
our
way
although
strategic
think
be
routine
work
you
still
have
to
create
struc
tures
where
it
can
flourish
we
set
up
a
strategy
panel
at
nokia
that
met
once
a
month
it
consist
of
the
executive
committee
augment
by
a
few
other
senior
manager
an
outsider
sit
in
on
a
meeting
of
the
strategy
panel
might
be
bewilder
the
discussion
might
take
some
great
issue
as
its
theme
but
it
would
be
equally
likely
to
focus
on
small
detail
the
most
im
portant
thing
be
that
no
decision
be
reach
at
the
meeting
there
be
no
agenda
and
no
minute
be
kept
sometimes
discussion
be
heat
sometimes
everyone
be
lose
in
thought
the
meeting
usually
last
about
three
hour
mikko
kosonen
who
be
responsible
for
corporate
planning
usually
propose
a
theme
or
occasionally
i
would
make
suggestion
for
dis
cussion
i
like
to
use
the
strategy
panel
to
test
out
my
own
idea
and
to
find
answer
to
those
question
at
the
forefront
of
my
mind
over
the
year
the
strategy
panel
demonstrate
its
usefulness
as
a
discus
sion
forum
i
enjoy
group
discussion
but
i
m
not
sure
they
bring
out
the

against
all
odds
best
in
me
i
suppose
i
ve
have
my
best
strategy
discussion
with
individual
on
a
one
on
one
basis
often
i
take
away
one
or
two
key
thought
from
the
strategy
panel
which
i
would
later
discus
with
the
relevant
colleague
my
leadership
style
be
base
on
the
five
and
also
on
direct
connection
to
the
two
hundred
or
so
key
individual
within
nokia
i
believe
that
wisdom
doesn
t
reside
in
the
head
of
some
great
leader
but
be
diffuse
throughout
the
workforce
company
usually
don
t
listen
enough
to
alternative
strategy
if
someone
have
end
up
as
a
chief
executive
or
executive
committee
member
he
have
almost
certainly
lose
not
only
his
hair
but
his
capacity
for
fresh
idea
but
even
experienced
manager
can
revital
ize
themselves
if
they
really
want
to
organization
should
encourage
this
renewal
because
otherwise
their
strategy
cannot
be
renew
but
even
more
than
that
organization
must
find
a
way
for
new
and
dissident
idea
to
make
themselves
heard
a
company
must
be
able
to
question
its
own
objective
and
work
method
otherwise
it
won
t
thrive
in
the
real
world
the
one
we
all
live
in
in
our
discussion
we
disagreed
over
only
a
few
matter
we
argue
vig
orously
about
how
we
should
work
with
mobile
network
operator
and
to
what
extent
we
should
tailor
our
product
to
please
them
we
have
divergent
opinion
about
that
for
at
least
a
decade
the
question
be
one
of
principle
and
go
to
the
heart
of
nokia
nokia
always
have
to
balance
the
conflict
demand
of
its
own
brand
and
the
need
of
its
customer
among
the
mo
bile
network
operator
whose
negotiate
power
varied
over
time
highly
competitive
auction
of
future
telephone
bandwidth
drove
many
of
them
to
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
then
nokia
and
others
have
to
keep
them
afloat
fi
nancially
so
that
business
could
carry
on
conversely
as
in
our
sale
of
mobile
phone
be
so
poor
at
time
that
sale
of
network
to
the
operator
be
the
only
thing
that
kept
our
business
afloat
but
even
within
nokia
there
be
extreme
difference
of
view
on
funda
mental
question
one
of
our
director
might
think
that
you
should
never
throw
in
your
lot
with
the
operator
but
should
aim
to
shake
them
off
even
tually
in
favor
of
deal
directly
with
individual
consumer
another
might
say
that
the
operator
be
among
our
most
important
customer
and
we
should
do
thing
exactly
as
they
want
it
would
be
nice
if
one
could
find
a
clear
answer
to
this
question
but
there
s
no
such
thing
so
nokia
will
always
have
to
navigate
this
passageway
as
best
it
can
it
may
be
that
nokia
focus
too
much
on
technology
associate
with
mobile
phone
cellular
technology
in
other
word
it
may
be
that
nokia
should
have
learn
more
about
other
wireless
technology
if
we
have
be
quicker
off
the
mark
we
might
have
developed
new
area
of
business
that
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
would
have
flourish
in
the
difficult
new
decade
of
the
s
but
over
haul
a
company
s
entire
strategy
be
no
longer
a
simple
matter
if
it
s
grown
to
become
the
global
leader
in
its
field
the
degree
of
difficulty
becomes
many
time
great
the
bad
that
can
happen
to
a
company
be
to
run
out
of
money
and
be
force
into
bankruptcy
enormous
success
be
perhaps
the
next
bad
it
dazzle
you
and
creates
the
notion
that
history
will
repeat
itself
impressive
growth
figure
or
the
opening
of
new
market
make
you
believe
that
there
exists
a
path
pave
with
gold
and
that
if
only
you
can
find
the
secret
of
success
you
ll
soon
find
your
way
back
to
it
if
the
company
have
be
suc
cessful
in
the
past
that
s
where
you
ll
probably
look
to
find
this
secret
if
the
company
have
grown
and
become
successful
it
can
no
longer
make
its
own
decision
investment
analyst
and
investor
follow
its
every
move
at
every
nanosecond
the
bad
news
an
investor
can
hear
be
that
the
company
have
make
a
new
and
unexpected
strategic
choice
that
will
lead
it
away
from
the
golden
path
with
its
guarantee
of
success
and
security
it
s
pointless
to
expect
investor
to
have
a
long
term
perspective
a
company
have
to
show
growth
in
its
share
price
in
the
short
term
over
the
next
reporting
period
a
company
have
to
do
what
it
promise
just
the
idea
of
a
company
take
a
new
direction
or
adopt
a
new
strategy
be
enough
to
scare
people
off
the
share
price
might
fall
and
the
company
may
have
less
room
to
maneuver
its
most
important
manager
will
lose
any
bonus
link
to
the
share
price
it
won
t
be
able
to
use
its
share
as
collateral
as
it
once
do
the
medium
will
use
its
share
price
performance
as
a
reason
to
condemn
its
change
in
direction
if
a
company
s
leader
be
to
push
through
a
new
strategy
or
a
complete
renewal
of
the
company
they
must
either
have
immense
willpower
or
face
a
crisis
if
you
set
out
to
renew
a
company
that
have
successfully
launch
itself
on
the
stock
exchange
you
may
even
put
your
own
financial
position
at
risk
that
make
it
very
difficult
to
revitalize
a
successful
global
public
company
even
so
some
succeed
for
example
i
admire
enormously
lou
gerstner
s
work
at
ibm
he
change
a
company
that
make
thing
into
one
that
sell
software
and
service
at
the
same
time
maintain
the
company
s
position
in
the
world
nokia
didn
t
become
a
major
internet
company
at
the
end
of
the
s
its
board
meeting
in
beijing
in
look
at
the
alternative
face
the
com
pany
either
remain
as
a
significant
force
in
wireless
technology
or
try
to
e
tablish
itself
in
the
new
market
open
up
by
the
internet
that
would
have
necessitate
major
acquisition
especially
in
the
united
state
at
the
time

against
all
odds
i
m
show
here
with
georg
ehrnrooth
member
of
the
nokia
board
of
director
the
internet
bubble
be
expand
nokia
s
profitability
and
its
share
price
would
have
dipped
for
a
few
year
and
the
company
could
well
have
become
the
target
for
a
hostile
takeover
nobody
know
where
we
would
have
be
by
say
it
s
possible
that
nokia
would
have
be
in
a
strong
position
but
it
s
also
possible
that
nokia
would
no
longer
have
an
independent
exis
tence
that
some
other
company
would
have
swallow
us
up
no
one
can
offer
a
certain
answer
to
a
counter
factual
question
my
own
role
at
nokia
change
as
the
end
of
the
millennium
approach
my
bos
chairman
of
the
board
casimir
ehrnrooth
invite
me
to
his
man
or
house
in
july
i
have
gotten
on
very
well
with
ehrnrooth
we
have
dealt
with
each
other
directly
no
fuss
around
just
discussion
and
agree
ment
on
major
issue
when
we
need
it
such
as
after
board
meeting
so
i
guess
there
must
be
some
special
reason
for
this
visit
but
i
didn
t
know
what
that
might
be
beforehand
we
take
a
sauna
and
be
eat
supper
when
ehrnrooth
explain
why
he
have
invite
me
i
ve
be
discuss
with
the
owner
who
should
be
chairman
of
the
board
we
re
all
agree
that
no
one
already
on
the
board
be
really
suit
to
the
job
we
ve
thought
about
it
and
i
wonder
whether
you
might
take
on
this
responsibility
give
that
operational
responsibility
would
continue
to
rest
with
you
the
arrangement
that
ehrnrooth
propose
which
combine
the
job
of
chair
and
chief
executive
be
common
in
u
s
company
but
less
so
in
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
europe
nokia
have
gradually
be
approach
the
u
s
model
in
its
internal
structure
and
against
that
background
the
proposal
wasn
t
unprecedent
ed
study
have
be
make
of
which
sort
of
company
work
well
those
where
the
chair
have
operational
responsibility
or
those
where
the
chair
and
the
chief
executive
be
different
people
no
significant
difference
have
be
identify
across
a
wide
range
of
company
or
over
both
long
and
short
time
frame
but
in
finnish
company
law
didn
t
allow
the
two
role
to
be
com
bin
so
we
need
to
do
some
work
on
the
legal
basis
for
the
decision
in
such
a
case
the
company
would
appoint
a
new
chief
executive
who
would
be
responsible
for
the
company
s
operation
in
the
sense
demand
by
the
law
though
it
would
be
agree
that
i
would
be
ultimately
responsible
for
the
company
s
operation
the
proposal
have
be
present
i
promise
to
think
about
it
over
several
month
because
there
be
clearly
no
great
hurry
we
would
revisit
the
be
sue
the
follow
autumn
i
m
ready
to
take
on
this
arrangement
though
in
finland
it
s
a
little
unusual
but
we
have
to
make
sure
the
legal
aspect
be
properly
work
out
be
my
answer
to
ehrnrooth
the
company
secretary
and
director
of
legal
affair
ursula
ranin
drew
up
a
long
and
thorough
memorandum
which
she
submit
in
december
as
well
as
the
legal
aspect
it
summarize
international
experience
the
advantage
of
the
dual
role
be
the
opportunity
it
give
for
decisive
ad
vancement
of
the
company
s
vision
and
chosen
focus
the
dual
role
be
risky
in
so
far
as
the
board
might
no
longer
be
independent
of
the
execu
tive
committee
there
would
be
an
exceptional
risk
if
the
board
s
member
be
link
to
or
dependent
on
the
company
or
its
executive
committee
the
board
s
ability
to
carry
out
its
supervisory
duty
would
be
weaken
and
it
be
likely
to
be
too
slow
to
respond
if
for
example
there
be
a
need
to
remove
board
member
around
this
time
we
carry
out
another
restructuring
pekka
ala
pietil
be
no
longer
in
charge
of
the
mobile
phone
division
but
be
now
responsi
ble
for
strategic
planning
and
project
link
with
nokia
s
future
we
have
set
up
the
new
venture
organization
to
identify
suitable
company
for
nokia
to
buy
pekka
be
in
charge
of
this
unit
and
he
also
continued
as
director
of
nokia
communication
product
he
be
also
appoint
deputy
chief
ex
ecutive
which
foreshadow
his
appointment
as
president
matti
alahuhta
become
head
of
the
mobile
phone
division
start
at
the
begin
of
the
president
of
the
network
division
would
be
sari
baldauf
who
have
be
run
our
operation
in
asia

against
all
odds
pekka
ala
pietil
be
thus
appoint
president
of
nokia
pekka
also
be
come
the
natural
candidate
to
take
over
from
me
when
i
eventually
stood
down
as
chairman
why
pekka
ala
pietil
i
knew
all
my
closest
colleague
extremely
well
pekka
seem
very
well
prepared
for
the
job
he
be
good
at
manage
people
and
have
a
strong
strategic
grasp
he
be
also
a
brilliant
change
manager
and
very
good
at
pick
up
signal
his
background
as
leader
of
the
mobile
phone
division
also
influence
the
decision
at
that
time
we
believe
that
mobile
phone
be
even
more
central
to
nokia
s
fu
ture
than
network
my
conversation
with
sari
baldauf
also
form
part
of
the
background
sari
have
told
me
that
she
didn
t
intend
to
spend
many
more
year
with
the
company
she
have
already
be
in
charge
of
network
for
nearly
a
decade
this
have
be
a
wonderful
project
but
there
must
be
something
more
to
life
than
nokia
be
how
she
put
it
her
original
intention
have
be
to
leave
nokia
in
but
the
combination
of
the
change
circumstance
and
some
arm
twist
from
me
persuade
her
to
stay
until
the
begin
of
the
official
decision
be
make
at
the
annual
general
meeting
in
casimir
ehrnrooth
step
down
from
the
role
of
chairman
of
the
board
after
seven
year
there
be
no
drama
about
this
ehrnrooth
be
sixty

pekka
ala
pietil
become
president
of
nokia
and
i
be
appoint
chairman
and
chief
executive
the
medium
didn
t
find
the
change
particularly
significant
only
the
job
ti
tles

write
the
business
weekly
talousel
m
i
emphasize
at
the
press
conference
that
in
the
last
resort
operational
responsibility
remain
with
me
of
course
everyone
should
have
a
bos
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
it
be
the
deputy
chair
of
the

who
fulfil
this
role
from

after
that
there
be
numerous

from
outside

from
the
nokia
of
old
where
the

he
take
quite
an
active
role
and
spoke
to
me
even
more
frequently
and
intensively
than
casimir
ehrnrooth
he
live
in
london
so
we
spoke
on
the
telephone
and
met
at
board
meeting
we
have
a
very
american
style
dialogue
unstructured
and
direct
collins
s
role
at
the
begin
of
the
s
be
notably
big
and
more
important
than
it
appear
in
public
jorma

and
harri
saukkomaa
chapter
meeting
the
medium
a
chief
executive
s
relation
with
the
medium
be
so
important
they
deserve
a
chapter
to
themselves
while
what
i
write
here
be
obvious
ly
base
on
my
experience
in
finland
the
lesson
i
learn
be
applicable
much
more
widely
perhaps
universally
even
when
i
be
at
school
i
actively
follow
both
the
finnish
and
the
international
medium
my
interest
deepen
when
i
be
at
atlantic
college
in
wale
our
economics
teacher
andrew
maclehose
spice
up
his
lesson
with
the
economist
and
the
financial
time
which
be
my
favorite
paper
for
decade
maclehose
taught
us
that
carefully
argue
article
make
an
impact
that
the
medium
may
describe
an
issue
in
different
way
and
that
it
s
essential
to
crystallize
one
s
argument
if
one
be
to
get
a
message
across
another
eye
opening
or
perhaps
i
should
say
ear
opening
experience
be
the
radio
edit
course
i
attend
in
vaasa
in
run
by
two
veteran
broadcaster
in
that
course
i
learn
my
first
lesson
in
how
journalism
simplifies
issue
trivializes
argument
and
insists
on
have
the
last
word
the
first
time
i
be
the
subject
of
medium
interest
be
during
my
time
as
president
of
the
national
union
of
university
student
in
finland
between
and
the
first
medium
profile
of
me
appear
in
in
finland
s
lead
newspaper
helsingin
sanomat
the
over
politicize
atmosphere
of
the
s
be
not
conducive
to
good
journalism
everything
be
see
through
a
political
party
lens
the
culture
of
journalism
be
weak
and
its
integrity
left
much
to
be
desire
it
be
yet
another
factor
contribute
to
our
decision
to
move
to
london
for
a
while
as
finance
director
of
nokia
i
met
many
investor
but
few
medium
rep
resentatives
because
they
focus
their
attention
on
the
charismatic
chair

against
all
odds
man
kari
kairamo
during
his
time
the
main
objective
of
nokia
s
medium
strategy
be
to
generate
international
coverage
of
its
fascinate
chairman
i
remember
kari
once
sigh
i
have
to
meet
every
little
parish
magazine
in
europe
that
have
any
interest
in
us
at
all
during
the
course
of
a
day
kairamo
might
meet
four
or
even
five
different
editor
even
though
there
might
be
nothing
much
happen
at
the
time
this
be
long
before
there
be
celeb
rity
ceo
kairamo
s
passing
left
a
vacuum
in
nokia
s
publicity
kairamo
s
successor
as
chairman
simo
vuorilehto
be
an
altogether
more
cautious
figure
the
man
in
charge
of
our
corporate
communication
matti
saarinen
described
his
medium
strategy
as
low
profile
dim
light
vuorilehto
didn
t
give
wide
range
interview
because
of
nokia
s
financial
problem
and
internal
power
battle
instead
a
steady
stream
of
gossip
and
rumor
issue
from
the
company
which
then
have
to
try
to
explain
it
away
it
would
have
be
best
for
nokia
not
to
appear
in
the
press
at
that
time
i
be
in
charge
of
mobile
phone
and
i
have
to
give
more
at
tention
to
the
medium
than
i
have
previously
in
the
small
town
of
salo
what
nokia
say
be
important
the
mobile
phone
unit
have
financial
problem
and

have
to
bring
my
team
along
with
me
in
the
battle
for
survival
from
time
to
time
i
met
the
chief
editor
of
the
local
paper
to
keep
him
up
to
date
on
what
be
really
hap
pen
i
would
call
him
on
my
way
to

drop
in
for
morning
coffee
before
my
real
work

i
believe
these
background
conversation
help
us
both
i
learn
a
lot
about
local
feel
and
manage
to
soften
the
general
impression
in
salo
of
nokia
as
the
great
unknown
when
i
march
into
the
first

i
have
inconsequentially
talk
about
earlier

and
newsworthy
i
also
learn
that
i
couldn
t
use
such
vigorous
and
direct
language
as
i
have
do
earlier
i
have
to
soften
my
me

so
that
the

wouldn

among

new

of

company
be
surprised
at
how
much
of
their
time
be
take
up
with
the
medium
and
become
accustom
to
the
medium
s
work
method
isn
t
a
simple
mat
ter
at
least
there
s
plenty
of
advice
it
s
well
to
say
nothing
than
to
tell
part
of
the
truth
you
should
never
talk
about
work
in
progress
you
should
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
never
comment
on
your
competitor
you
shouldn
t
discus
internal
matter
in
public
you
should
guard
against
complacency
you
should
keep
a
clear
head
in
a
crisis
some
of
the
best
advice
i
ever
receive
come
from
marjorie
scardino
our
long
time
deputy
chair
about
ten
year
ago
scardino
have
be
a
journalist
and
be
for
a
long
time
the
chief
executive
of
pearson
which
own
the
fi
nancial
time
when
your
company
be
in
crisis
and
you
feel
weak
and
lack
energy
don
t
bother
with
what
journalist
write
when
thing
be
go
well
and
your
ear
be
ring
with
praise
don
t
yield
to
the
temptation
to
read
the
press
in
both
case
take
a
break
this
seem
very
wise
to
me
in
january
nokia
s
position
be
so
serious
that
we
have
to
implement
a
lot
of
major
change
at
once
which
take
up
all
our
time
so
our
communi
cation
strategy
wasn
t
very
high
on
the
list
of
priority
of
the
new
executive
committee
it
may
have
help
that
finland
s
domestic
medium
didn
t
believe
nokia
have
any
chance
of
success
during
the
economic
depression
of
that
time
there
be
more
than
enough
horror
to
go
around
without
seek
them
out
so
we
be
left
in
peace
for
a
couple
of
year
to
build
the
future
i
do
however
set
out
a
simple
policy
we
would
appear
in
the
press
when
it
would
advance
nokia
s
interest
and
we
wouldn
t
sell
story
use
the
chief
executive
the
difference
from
kari
kairamo
s
time
be
evident
the
new
policy
be
possible
because
mobile
phone
be
enter
general
use
little
by
little
and
we
be
become
more
interest
as
a
result
building
the
nokia
brand
have
start
in
earnest
in
spring
the
five
discuss
the
form
our
communication
should
take
it
seem
that
my
colleague
all
have
their
hand
full
with
other
work
and
woe
they
suggest
that
i
should
take
more
explicit
responsibility
for
communication
and
relieve
them
of
pressure
from
the
medium
i
go
along
with
this
but
i
told
them
that
their
turn
would
come
in
interview
i
take
the
line
that
i
be
strictly
focus
on
my
job
and
i
would
give
interview
only
when
i
have
something
new
and
interest
to
say
chief
executive
can
easily
fall
in
love
with
pr
to
the
point
where
the
job
be
forgotten
and
only
their
vi
ibility
and
image
be
important
in
extreme
case
they
begin
to
live
through
their
publicity
i
decide
to
avoid
that
usually
in
interview
i
concentrate
on
the
most
important
matter
from
nokia
s
standpoint
though
occasion
ally
i
take
a
position
on
issue
of
broader
interest
to
society
i
refuse
to
do
interview
on
personal
topic
i
found
myself
best
suit
to
longer
theme
interview
that
allow
me
to
go
deeper
into
the
subject
a
cover
story
in
businessweek
then
highly
regard
have
long
be
one
of
our
goal
it
be
finally
achieve
in
august
though
story
about
us

against
all
odds
nokia
s
success
make
me
the
desire
interviewee
of
the
world
s
medium
i
be
on
the
cover
of
businessweek
for
the
first
time
in
have
be
publish
earlier
we
didn
t
pursue
the
cover
story
for
its
intrinsic
value
but
because
it
would
confirm
that
nokia
have
at
last
become
a
globally
important
firm
a
similar
article
appear
in
forbes
in
may
these
two
treatment
of
nokia
s
progress
through
the
s
be
in
a
class
of
their
own
no
other
article
succeed
so
well
in
capture
the
essence
of
nokia
s
company
culture
it
be
perplex
and
astonish
that
no
finnish
journal
ist
even
try
to
do
so
the
american
specialist
medium
be
in
a
supreme
position
for
grab
international
attention
story
spread
at
the
speed
of
light
to
the
medium
else
where
so
they
have
a
powerful
impact
on
the
way
the
company
be
per
ceived
globally
i
d
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
our
listing
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
in
and
the
simultaneous
breakthrough
of
gsm
technology
be
the
turn
point
as
far
as
the
nokia
brand
be
concerned
when
product
be
launch
it
s
customary
to
arrange
group
interview
or
to
stage
them
around
the
production
line
i
be
never
very
keen
on
these
though
i
do
them
from
time
to
time
fortunately
at
nokia
we
have
a
large
group
of
medium
train
expert
which
widen
the
pool
of
company
spokespeople
we
always
use
to
consider
very
carefully
who
would
best
represent
us
at
any
give
interview
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
in
anglo
saxon
style
we
have
delegate
some
of
the
spokesperson
s
role
to
our
press
office
even
in
kairamo
s
day
this
have
long
be
standard
practice
in
major
company
but
it
be
relatively
new
to
finland
and
give
rise
to
a
lively
discussion
among
editor
for
us
it
be
a
question
of
the
best
use
of
the
executive
committee
s
time
the
committee
need
to
focus
on
develop
ing
the
company
and
meeting
customer
staff
and
other
stakeholder
the
press
office
on
the
other
hand
be
always
ready
and
available
so
nokia
could
meet
the
medium
s
need
without
delay
we
have
also
follow
major
international
company
in
insist
that
someone
from
the
press
office
accompany
senior
figure
at
interview
this
too
be
unpopular
with
the
finnish
medium
though
it
have
be
stan
dard
practice
elsewhere
for
decade
i
use
to
maintain
close
link
with
our
communication
director
so
that
our
press
office
knew
what
be
go
on
at
nokia
and
also
so
i
would
know
what
interested
the
medium
at
any
give
time
at
nokia
i
have
the
chance
to
work
with
first
class
medium
professional
which
change
my
understand
of
the
medium
for
good
each
member
of
our
medium
team
have
their
own
independent
understand
of
what
the
com
munications
director
s
role
should
be
and
they
act
as
key
adviser
and
spar
partner
for
the
chief
executive
as
nokia
s
position
become
strong
and
it
become
a
fortune
com
pany
i
receive
more
and
more
request
for
interview
i
stuck
fast
to
the
line
that
the
most
publicity
be
not
the
best
publicity
i
do
indeed
do
more
interview
but
i
try
to
limit
my
medium
work
so
that
i
would
appear
often
enough
but
not
too
often
in
the
international
medium
otherwise
the
press
office
cover
most
of
our
publicity
at
the
end
of
the
s
and
even
at
the
begin
of
the
s
there
be
many
chief
executive
in
the
united
state
who
have
a
high
profile
i
regard
this
as
a
dangerous
strategy
from
the
viewpoint
of
both
the
company
and
the
chief
executive
i
have
always
enjoy
background
interview
with
editor
more
than
tra
ditional
interview
these
conversation
be
reward
for
both
party
i
gain
a
lot
from
them
and
they
give
me
the
chance
to
explain
what
be
go
ing
on
at
nokia
without
the
distortion
of
the
chief
executive
s
megaphone
when
you
don
t
have
to
plan
every
word
in
advance
you
can
concentrate
well
on
what
you
re
actually
say
and
have
an
exchange
of
view
the
journalist
for
their
part
can
benefit
from
the
conversation
in
the
way
that
they
want
if
they
want
ever
since
atlantic
college
i
have
admire
the
anglo
saxon
culture
of
de
bate
though
it
isn
t
well
suit
to
an
interview
situation
on
the
other
hand

against
all
odds
in
background
conversation
one
can
approach
issue
in
a
more
provoca
tive
way
from
different
standpoint
which
i
believe
should
interest
editor
as
well
the
finnish
and
the
international
medium
react
differently
to
this
international
journalist
like
wide
range
background
briefing
from
which
they
could
pluck
a
few
nugget
to
quote
finnish
editor
on
the
other
hand
prize
the
question
and
answer
format
and
like
to
make
recording
though
to
my
delight
i
found
that
a
few
of
them
enjoy
a
free
form
dia
logue
many
editor
have
the
ability
to
see
all
side
of
an
issue
and
to
analyze
and
shape
them
our
relationship
with
the
finnish
press
wasn
t
always
problem
free
and
no
wonder
give
nokia
s
position
as
a
large
global
company
in
a
relatively
small
economy
on
the
other
hand
i
be
a
blunt
speak
finn
deeply
com
mitted
to
my
job
and
my
company
at
time
i
be
very
direct
because
we
be
such
a
big
company
in
such
an
interest
field
investor
be
quick
to
calculate
the
cash
value
of
every
little
story
a
single
mistake
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
our
share
price
which
be
always
a
prob
lem
for
list
company
error
be
never
beneficial
to
a
company
nor
be
the
rumor
mill
they
hamper
normal
activity
and
speculator
make
money
from
them
i
remember
a
number
of
article
where
i
disagreed
with
the
editor
my
policy
be
to
say
so
because
i
found
it
hard
to
take
criticism
base
on
misin
formation
or
mislead
assertion
all
editor
claim
to
want
feedback
but
my
experience
suggests
differently
the
medium
s
appreciation
of
dialogue
have
sometimes
be
limited
though
thing
have
improve
over
time
when
in
i
step
down
from
the
position
of
chief
executive
to
become
part
time
chairman
of
the
board
i
try
to
draw
a
clear
distinc
tion
between
the
public
face
of
the
two
role
as
a
young
chief
executive
i
have
enjoy
exceptional
support
from
the
chairman
of
the
board
casimir
ehrnrooth
he
define
his
role
very
clearly
while
also
strongly
support
me
in
the
same
way
i
want
to
withdraw
from
nokia
s
pr
work
and
give
strong
background
support
to
olli
pekka
kallasvuo

the
rest
of

we

as
we
should
have
be
it
s
easy
to
say
with
the
benefit
of

that
we
didn
t
invest
enough
of
our
profit
from

year
perhaps
we
should
have
do
more
to
control
the
growth
perhaps
we
should
have
thought
harder
about
how
fast
our
workforce
be
grow
perhaps
we
should
have
thought
about
the
organization
in
a
different
way
we
could
revisit
many
of
our
decision
but
everyone
at
nokia
know
in
their
heart
what
growth
feel
like
in
the
s
it
be
exceptionally
rapid
it
make
ev
ery
heart
beat
faster
it
create
ambitious
target
of
its
own
accord
or
so
it
seem
many
of
those
target
be
achieve
we
be
an
efficient
machine
that
produce
more
money
for
its
owner
than
any
other
company
in
our
area
we
have
also
become
one
of
the

most
valuable
brand

promising
young
people
all
over
the

be
queue
up
to
work
for
us
by
the
begin
of

s
people
weren
t
buying
mobile
phone
in
such
large
number
as
earlier
or
more
precisely
people
want
to
buy
just
the
same
number
as
before
but
not
more
in
spring
i
estimate
that
about
million
phone
would
be
sell
worldwide
that
year
roughly
the

as
the
previous

relieve
nokia
s
hangover
from
its
year
of
growth
in
july
i
say
that
well
time
would
dawn
again
the
follow
year
but
in
my
heart
i
wasn
t
sure
nokia
be
a
self
confident
efficient
and
profitable
company
with
a
keen
sense
of
its
own
worth
and
its
own
value
its
employee
have
earn
this
through
hard
work
sometimes
at
personal
sacrifice
many
have
also
receive
a
more
concrete
reward
option
and
bonus
have
make
many
nokia
em
ployees
wealthy
a
strong
sense
of
one
s
own
worth
however
may
lead
to
self
satisfaction
and
slackness
when
we
be
recruiting
large

at
the
end
of
the

not
all
the

want
to
simply
do
their
best

it
wasn
t
a
question
of
weakness
within
the

come
from

completely
different
company
from
the

i
have

experienced
a
great

ten
year
as
chief

company

an
exceptional
length
of
service
our
competitor
have
all
change
their
leader
rather
often
one
reason
for
that
of
course
be
that
the
company
board
and
shareholder
hadn
t
be
satisfied
with
their
performance
i
didn
t
have
that
problem
i
have
told
the
board
two
thing
i
would
carry
on
at
least
until
and
i
thought
pekka
ala
pietil
who
have
be
manage
director
since
should
be
my
successor
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
be
an
excellent
alternative
he
be
currently
finance
director
this
be
my
last
will
and
testament
which
i
entrust
to
the
board
in
case
something
serious
should
befall
me
i
have
begin
to
discus
these
issue
with
the
board
in
the
summer
of
i
be
the
board
chairman
but
it
wasn
t
for
me
to
decide
my
own
future
i
spoke
to
the
board
member
the
deputy
chairman
and
chair
of
the
person
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
nel
committee
paul
collins
played
a
lead
role
the
board
wasn
t
at
all
keen
even
to
discus
a
change
of
the
ceo
in
nor
be
they
ready
to
nominate
pekka
ala
pietil
as
my
successor
fine
then
i
propose
that
i
stay
on
until
i
ll
put
that
down
on
paper
and
we
ll
make
it
public
i
say
to
paul
collins
this
seem
to
have
the
sup
port
of
the
board
and
that
be
how
agreement
be
reach
that
i
would
stay
at
nokia
at
least
until
the
formal
announcement
be
make
at
the
end
of
october
the
press
described
this
as
exceptional
perhaps
because
other
company
seem
keener
to
change
their
ceo
than
to
keep
them
for
their
part
the
nokia
board
want
to
ensure
that
i
would
stay
a
few
more
year
the
board
felt
comfortable
have
a
familiar
leader
during
such
a
turmoil
in
the
industry
the
timing
of
a
change
determines
everything
the
wrong
change
even
when
the
time
be
ripe
may
bring
down
a
successful
company
once
and
for
all
the
right
change
but
at
the
wrong
time
won
t
help
the
company
but
will
cause
opportunity
to
be
lose
perhaps
the
market
aren
t
ready
for
the
change
or
perhaps
the
consumer
aren
t
ready
for
the
new
product
why
can
t
chief
executive
time
their
decision
right
if
everything
de
pends
on
their
ability
to
do
so
ultimately
the
timing
of
a
decision
be
base
on
intuition
alone
there
be
no
compelling
objective
reason
either
gen
eral
or
specific
on
which
to
base
the
change
to
carry
out
a
major
change
within
a
company
be
never
a
democratic
decision
it
s
for
the
head
of
the
company
to
bear
the
responsibility
for
the
change
very
often
their
most
important
task
be
to
sense
when
those
change
should
be
make
complex
change
be
an
everyday
matter
in
the
area
where

their

all
this

s
most
fascinate
place
to
work
i
have
live
in
the
middle
of
it
and
make
an
impact
i
couldn
t
hope
for
more
i
try
to
sense
those
moment
when
the
organization
have
to
shake
itself
up
and
transform
itself
into
something
new
change
be
in
part
an
absolute
value
people
shouldn
t
be
left
to
loll
around
in
comfortable
chair
in
beauti
ful

because
human
nature
resists
change
without
change
we
have
no
way
of
go
forward
our
development
as
human
being
grind
to
a
halt
that
s
why
i
rotate
change
and
reorganize
nokia
s
leadership
so
many
time
it
s
easy
to
push
through
change
if
the
company
be
in
danger
or
if
difficult
time
clearly
lie
ahead
everyone
then
understands
why
change
be
necessary
the
old
road
be
no
good
a
well
route
to
a
brighter
future
have
to
be
found
crisis
be
the
best
catalyst
of
change

against
all
odds
the
hardest
thing
be
to
sense
the
need
for
change
and
then
to
put
change
into
effect
just
when
everything
seem
to
be
go
well
when
the
figure
look
good
revenue
be
grow
and
profitability
remains
high
it
s
difficult
even
to
talk
about
change
it
s
also
very
difficult
to
shift
a
manager
whose
life
story
be
one
of
uninterrupted
success
even
so
a
transfer
may
be
the
only
sensible
thing
to
do
if
the
old
method
aren
t
work

i
n
october
the
world

other
thing
to
think
about
than
the
timetable
for
the
departure

with

official
from

i
caught
her
on
the
phone
in
spain
where
the
atmo
sphere
be
nervous
and
gloomy
i
d

while
back
to
have
dinner
with
my
daughter
anna
that
eve
ning
on
the
one
hand
i
felt
that
i
should
stay
at
nokia
with
my
team
on
this
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
particular
even
on
the

liisa
be
away
there
be
no
food
at

and
i
have
to
eat
something
perhaps

anna
would
like
to
see

in
particular
she
have
spent
the
day

and
at
around

one
of
the

coach
have
told
her
that
some
thing
weird
have
happen
in
new
york
this
be
the
most
important
thing
to
happen
to
our
generation
because
it
really
be
go
to
change
the
world
sadly
it
s
both
the
most
important
thing
but
it
s
also
really
negative
i
thought
as
my
car
take
me
to
the
center
of
hel
sinki
which
seem
empty
people
have

everyone
who
could
be
sit
next
to
the
people
they
love
many
people
be
take
refuge
in
the
familiar
and
the
secure
travel
and
indeed
globalization
come
to
a
standstill
that
day
the
belief
in
trade
in
progress
in
a
civilize
dialogue
between
culture
seem
to
have
die
at
the
same
time
overwhelmed
by
the
cloud
of
smoke
and
dust
the
terrible
explosion
in
new
york
have
release
my
driver

me
from
our
headquarters
over
the

as
we
drove
the
sun
be
set
on
the
baltic
horizon
there
be
still
leaf
on
the
tree
on
helsinki

boulevard
as
the
last
ray
of
the
even
sun
re
flected
off
the
wall
of
the
austere
white
swedish
theatre
i
be
a
few
minute
late
at
the
cool
new
italian
restaurant
via

and
i
sat
in
a
window
seat
with
my
back
to
the
window
i
survey
the
restaurant
there
weren
t
many
people
there
and
those
who
be
didn
t
take
much
notice
of
me
which
be
unusual
in
a
finnish
restaurant
perhaps
people
have
other
thing
to
think
about
we
order
a
stir
fry
which
come
promptly
but
represent
no
sort
of
culinary
landmark
we
talk
about
what
would
happen
if
the
united
state
curl
up
into
its
shell
or
withdrew
from
the
rest
of

little
worried

be
i
make
a
few
call
to
manhattan
and
get
through
to
some
of
my
friend
surprisingly
easily
pentti
kouri
be
in
good
shape
and
ready
to
analyze
what
the
terrorist
attack
meant
for
the
world

future
most
of
the
mobile

i
say
goodnight
to

and
return
to
nokia
at
about
nine
thirty
i
checked
the
bulletin
we
be
send
out
and
sent
an
email
to
the
entire
workforce
after
an
hour
i
left
for
my
empty
home
where
i
watch
the

against
all
odds
well
before
midnight
i
get
hold
of
my
son
and
his
wife
now
i
knew
that
the
whole
of
my
international
family
be
safe
and
well
the
follow
morning
the
world
have
change

have
start
to
look
at
their
own
security
arrangement
travel
be
restrict
i
be
all
too
conscious
that
the
arrangement
for
my
own
security
have
be
beefed
up
it
meant
i
could
no
longer
move
around
freely
just
anywhere
as
a
private
indi
vidual
somebody
somewhere
knew
all
my
movement
all
the
trip
i
make
everything
i
do
it
wasn
t
a
particularly
inspire
thought
but
that
follow
morning
many
other
thing
carry
on
as
before
i
have
promise
to
speak
at
a
seminar
at
the
labor
ministry
at
o
clock
at
half
past
eight
i
rang
the
chief
of
staff
at
the
ministry
to
ask
whether
the
seminar
would
go
ahead
now
that
circumstance
seem
to
have
change
the
of
ficial
listen
to
me
as
if
i
be
an
idiot
of
course
it
will
he
say
so
i
go
to
the
seminar
and
give
my
presentation
we
observe
a
moment
of
silence
in
memory
of
the
victim
of
the
terrorist
attack
in
new
york
i
want
at
once
to
say
something
that
wouldn
t
sound
completely
sorrow
ful
i
say
that
the
event
be
indeed
tragic
it
could
well
change
the
way
in
which
we
related
to
the
world
to
work
and
to
each
other
it
be
however
too
early
to
say
what
its
ultimate
effect
would
be
in
the
midst
of
tragedy
it
be
important
to
maintain
a
positive
attitude
although
a
knowledge
base
society
be
extremely
vulnerable
in
some
way
it
have
new
strength
that
would
help
it
to
function
in
a
crisis
i
manage
to
reach
my
friend
in
manhattan
from
here
in
finland
with
out
any
trouble
all
yesterday
even
we
should
try
to
ensure
that
such
thing
work
in
the
future
whatever
the
circumstance
i
say
to
the
televi
sion
camera
the
quote
be
then
extract
and
broadcast
for
the
delecta
tion
of
finnish
viewer
on
the
main
news
bulletin
that
even
a
few
day
later
i
really
get
it
in
the
neck
for
that
some
journalist
or
other
complain
that
i
have
make
a
marketing
speech
when
the
world
be
try
to
come
to
term
with
its
grief
he
can
scarcely
have
know
what
i
say
or
meant
but
i
be
label
a
greedy
capitalist
who
try
to
sell
his
phone
even
when
more
sensitive
soul
be
mourn
the
tragic
death
of
thousand
that
wasn
t
how
i
saw
it
but
i
didn
t
enjoy
a
right
of
reply
to
the
medium
s
condemnation
i
think
the
whole
seminar
should
have
be
postpone
the
morning
after
the
attack
finland
still
seem
to
be
take
the
whole
event
very
much
in
its
stride
though
it
would
have
a
real
impact
on
finn
american
muslim
and
christian
i
didn
t
have
any
idea
what
would
come
next
but
i
could
see
that
it
wouldn
t
be
anything
terribly
good
i
knew
that
much
already
that
first
morning
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
when
i
have
give
my
speech
at
the
seminar
i
return
to
nokia
to
see
how
thing
be
the
world
s
future
now
look
different
and
that
meant
that
nokia
s
future
be
also
different
from
what
it
have
be
on
tuesday
now
we
have
to
make
a
quick
assessment
of
what
have
change
and
how
much
we
have
arrange
for
a
board
meeting
to
take
place
in
bangkok
and
singa
pore
the
follow
week
a
first
round
of
phone
call
show
that
life
go
on
and
our
customer
would
value
the
visit
this
be
a
good
sign
nokia
would
be
there
for
its
customer
in
bad
time
as
well
as
good
that
wednes
day
i
decide
that
the
meeting
would
go
ahead
as
plan
on
thursday
i
thought
thing
through
again
and
talk
to
my
fellow
director
on
friday
i
change
my
decision
the
strategy
and
board
meeting
would
be
held
in
fin
land
that
be
the
surest
and
safest
thing
to
do
suddenly
finland
seem
a
rather
wonderful
location
for
the
headquarters
of
a
major
company
the
terrorist
attack
in
themselves
hadn
t
make
any
difference
to
nokia
s
plan
the
meeting
didn
t
lead
to
change
in
our
objective
or
our
view
of
market
fundamental
but
we
do
look
more
closely
at
the
figure
and
we
reduce
some
of
our
forecast
the
global
economy
have
be
slow
since
april
but
now
there
be
a
separate
discussion
under
way
what
im
pact
would
the
terrorist
attack
have
on
the
outlook
for
growth
how
much
would
the
u
s
recession
deepen
what
would
it
mean
for
growth
elsewhere
in
the
world
how
long
would
the
impact
of
the
attack
be
felt
my
view
be
clear
the
attack
would
have
a
deep
and
long
term
effect
on

thing
the
board
didn
t
want
to
take
firm
posi
tions
or
make
hasty
decision
there
would
be
time
for
that
later
before
the
board
meeting
we
consider
many
everyday
matter
we
de
cided
that
we
should
do
something
to
help
those
who
have
suffer
in
the
terrorist
attack
we
would
support
the
international
youth
foundation
and
set
up
a
million
dollar
fund
for
the
education
of
child
who
have
lose
one
or
both
parent
in
addition
we
would
at
least
match
the
money
donate
by
our
employee
the
terrorist
attack
also
affected
nokia
s
travel
arrangement
we
have
employee
in
the
united
state
who
now
have
to
get
use
to
tight
secu
rity
control
and
new
travel
rule
we
also
need
to
ensure
that
our
supply
chain
would
hold
up
what
would
happen
to
our
production
in
the
united
state
we
lose
a
little
production
but
thing
be
back
to
normal
after
a
couple
of
day
almost
the
first
thing
we
do
be
to
look
again
at
our
marketing
cam
paign
we
be
sell
the
communicator
on
the
basis
of
a
lively
television
and
newspaper
campaign
that
show
a
company
chair
brandishing
a
phone

against
all
odds
and
jumping
through
a
glass
door
so
that
the
splinter
flew
in
all
direction
i
decide
we
would
drop
this
campaign
as
soon
as
we
could
there
be
enough
splinter
in
the
world
without
nokia
add
to
the
debris
nokia
s
internal
discussion
on
the
impact
of
the
attack
go
on
for
some
time
our
employee
wonder
in
email
why
the
world
have
become
the
place
it
have
people
be
worried
and
panicky
they
be
also
depressed
for
about
ten
day
nokia
didn
t
function
at
its
usual
energy
level
because
the
horror
of
the
recent
event
have
demoralize
people
suddenly
the
future
didn
t
seem
quite
as
appeal
as
we
have
always
believe
it
would
be
sud
denly
it
seem
frighten
threaten
and
unpredictable
people
didn
t
try
to
put
these
thought
into
word
but
i
only
have
to
look
around
me
to
see
that
the
organization
be
run
in
a
low
gear
our
usual
energy
and
en
thusiasm
have
evaporate
people
begin
to
ponder
ethical
issue
more
than
they
have
before
at
the
begin
of
the
decade
i
have
see
criticism
of
globalization
grow
ever
louder
as
it
become
a
strong
force
for
change
in
genoa
young
people
have
protest
against
those
they
saw
as
responsible
for
globalization
these
include
lead
politician
the
leader
of
the
big
company
and
the
international
organization
that
assist
them
i
be
certainly
among
them
although
nokia
never
appear
on
the
list
of
the
five
bad
compa
ny
perhaps
because
nokia
s
product
help
the
demonstrator
organize
their
own
event
i
suppose
our
market
share
among
them
be
around
percent
the
oil
company
shell
among
them
tend
to
top
the
list
just
ahead
of
clothing
company
and
pharmaceutical
giant
the
finnish
for
estry
industry
come
in
for
its
share
of
vitriol
too
in
the
summer
of
i
ask
two
of
finland
s
most
senior
politician
what
the
anti
globalization
movement
meant
what
would
happen
next
the

couldn
t
an
swer
they
just
say
everything
look
dreadful
jeffrey
sachs
write
in
the
new
york
time
that
defender
of
globalization
shouldn
t
head
for
their
bunker
when
the
demonstrator
attack
when
the
g
leader
do
that
and
increase
their
security
measure
the
demon
strators
start
to
go
for
company
and
their
leader
there
hasn
t
be
enough
discussion
with
the
critic
of
globalization
no
one
try
to
understand
the
argument
against
globalization
before
try
to
defend
it
i
didn
t
then
and
i
don
t
now
believe
that
the
world
would
be
such
a
thrive
place
without
a
strong
global
economy
but
we
should
listen
to
what
the
critic
of
globalization
have
to
say
our
customer
understand
toward
business
will
soon
disappear
if
company
screw
thing
up
though
from
the
point
of
view
of
morale
it
s
even
bad
if
employee
lose
their
pride
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
in
the
firm
they
work
for
democracy
and
economic
well
be
always
go
hand
in
hand
if
market
open
on
a
global
scale
it
s
more
likely
that
democ
racy
will
prevail
nokia
be
a
business
and
it
can
do
good
thing
only
if
it
s
both
profitable
and
grow
nokia
can
t
save
the
world
at
the
cost
of
its
own
profit
but
we
can
try
to
make
those
profit
responsibly
some
people
think
that
a
company
s
only
job
be
to
turn
a
profit
regardless
of
the
cost
or
consequence
at
the
opposite
extreme
there
be
those
who
believe
that
company
should
forget
about
profit
and
concentrate
on
good
work
in
my
view
both
be
wrong
a
company
s
job
be
to
produce
a
profit
while
recognize
its
wider
responsibility
otherwise
the
profit
may
turn
out
to
be
short
live
and
the
company
will
do
badly
the
world
rightly
expect
much
from
company
and
their
leader
but
it
shouldn
t
demand
that
they
do
what
they
can
t
do
senior
executive
be
paid
to
think
of
where
the
interest
of
the
company
lie
and
how
to
develop
it
politician
be
chosen
often
through
a
democratic
process
to
balance
wider
interest
they
carry
their
own
responsibility
and
be
answerable
to
their
electorate
company
executive
cannot
replace
politician
that
would
wreck
both
political
and
business
life
sometimes
even
talk
about

back

prin
ciples
in
search
of
a
future
for
ourselves
and
our
company
at
the
end
of
i
have
kick
off
discussion
aim
at
make
nokia
readier
to
face
the
challenge
of
the
future
the
five
our
core
group
of
the
five
most
se
nior
executive
held
intensive
meeting
over
several
week
we
ask
our
self
all
the
fundamental
question
what
should
nokia
do
how
should
it
be
structure
where
will
future
growth
come
from
how
can
idea
and
people
circulate
within
the
company
to
best
effect
how
can
we
ensure
that
our
product
be
the
one
the
world
s
consumer
want
to
buy
i
have
decide
it
be
time
to
reorganize
nokia
and
this
time
i
want
to
change
the
basic
structure
of
the
company
for
year
nokia
have
be
di
vided
into
two
part
mobile
phone
and
mobile
phone
network
for
too
long
now
we
have
serve
all
the
world
s
mobile
phone
customer
through
a
single
organization
without
consider
what
customer
really
want
i
also
believe
that
nokia
need
to
become
strong
in
software
we
have
to
gear
up
for
a
possible
battle
against
microsoft
we
didn
t
fight
in
those
meeting
no
one
shout
at
anyone
we
be
use
to
talk
thing
through
with
each
other
we
be
sensitive
to
when
someone
be
get
irritated
or
when
someone
ought
to
give
in
we
have
work
together
for
over
ten
year
we
knew
every
mood
every
glance
ev
ery
frown
we
knew
who
would
start
the
ball
roll
and
who
would
have
the
last
word
sari
baldauf
compare
the
relationship
between
the
five
of
us
to
an
endure
marriage
where
there
wasn
t
any
need
to
say
much
but
every
thing
be
understood
it
be
our
strength
but
also
our
weakness
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
this
major
reorganization
of
nokia
be
the
last
thing
the
five
of
us
would
do
together
we
have
have
many
adventure
we
have
create
a
great
company
but
now
we
have
to
prepare
it
for
a
new
era
i
batter
the
group
with
endless
question
what
if
we
put
mobile
phone
and
network
together
would
we
achieve
great
growth
and
would
we
offer
a
well
service
to
the
operator
or
what
if
we
have
four
business
unit
rather
than
two
or
what
if
nokia
be
organize
along
geographi
cal
line
rather
than
by
business
unit
perhaps
then
we
would
be
well
at
take
local
culture
into
account
i
carry
on
with
my
question
and
i
make
the
director
present
counter
argument
which
enable
us
to
rule
out
unworkable
idea
after
many
meeting
after
many
sketch
pad
have
be
fill
up
with
diagram
and
idea
we
make
our
decision
the
new
organiza
tion
be
ready
we
hadn
t
use
consultant
because
i
don
t
believe
they
add
much
value
to
a
company
s
deliberation
on
its
basic
strategy
i
m
well
know
to
be
a
bad
customer
for
the
service
they
offer
one
of
them
once
told
me
that
when
he
be
sell
his
idea
to
the
head
of
a
company
he
wouldn
t
take
a
single
piece
of
paper
along
with
him
because
top
executive
either
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
read
a
word
he
say
that
about
half
of
chief
executive
never
open
a
book
either
for
business
or
pleasure
so
consultant
need
the
ability
to
sell
the
next
big
idea
to
their
client
as
if
they
be
stone
age
people
sit
around
their
campfire
that
technique
wouldn
t
work
with
me
i
need
argument
and
justification
preferably
set
out
on
paper
if
you
need
to
read
a
couple
of
book
bring
them
on
let
s
do
it
nokia
have
employ
consultant
but
their
work
have
start
only
when
we
ve
complete
our
groundwork
my
experience
be
that
consultant
have
the
most
to
offer
when
it
come
to
implement
a
strategy
create
the
strategy
be
a
task
for
the
company
s
leadership
who
must
present
it
to
the
firm
s
owner
and
the
board
that
represent
them
after
a
dialogue
the
board
accepts
the
agree
upon
strategy
the
board
be
generally
not
the
place
where
strategy
or
important
organizational
change
should
be
plan
except
per
hap
in
small
company
or
those
active
in
very
mature
area
otherwise
the
chief
responsibility
for
push
the
strategy
through
must
lie
with
the
operational
leadership
for
the
last
ten
year
this
company
have
make
all
its
own
decision
without
outside
help
there
s
no
reason
to
assume
that
consultant
can
resolve
our
current
challenge
well
than
we
can
let
s
keep
thing
in
our
own
hand
be
what
i
say
to
my
colleague
some
consultant
and
management
guru
do
influence
our
think
i
ve
already
mention
gary
hamel
and
the
idea
he
give
us
for
search

against
all
odds
ing
out
new
opening
i
ve
always
urge
people
to
read
all
the
new
book
that
come
out
and
to
learn
something
from
them
and
apply
what
they
ve
learn
but
you
have
to
have
your
own
idea
and
reach
your
own
deci
sion
good
and
bad
nokia
have
long
be
one
of
the
company
that
management
guru
fol
low
closely
they
told
us
what
they
thought
but
often
they
ask
us
what
we
thought
this
create
a
synthesis
between
how
nokia
and
other
compa
ny
operate
the
guru
summarize
their
idea
in
book
or
in
article
in
the
harvard
business
review
i
often
saw
nokia
s
work
method
described
there
and
compare
to
those
of
other
firm
but
company
culture
and
cir
cumstances
will
ultimately
determine
how
idea
will
be
use
and
adapt
nokia
s
new
organization
be
put
in
place
at
the
begin
of
may
in
finland
people
go
off
on
their
summer
holiday
at
the
end
of
june
and
i
want
to
achieve
something
before
that
the
change
be
great
and
ana
lysts
investor
and
journalist
all
picked
up
on
it
and
of
course
so
do
all
nokia
s
employee
who
do
their
best
to
adapt

we
have
hop
the

unit
be

our
main

the

it
hadn
t
make
much
impact
yet
in
term
of
sale
but
it
be
very
important

devel
oping
our

the

on

nokia

be
intend
to
create
a
community
of
core
customer
they
would
be
offer
special
service
ap
plication

this
would
also
enhance
loyalty
toward
nokia
as
a
brand
our
new
structure
say
all
there
be
to
say
about
what
be
happen
in
our
business
we
have
different
sort
of
customer
there
be
no
longer
one
mass
of
people
to
whom
we
could
sell
identical
or
even
similar
phone
for
a
while
we
have
be
like
ford
in
the

which
have
sell
all
customer
its
model
t
in
any
color
as
long
as
it
s
black
ford
s
dominance
end
when
general

start
to
offer
customer
a
range
of
car
with
name
such
as
chevrolet
oldsmobile
and
cadillac
the
auto
market
be
now
divide
into
segment
if
customer
want
to
buy
a
different
kind
of
car
they
didn
t
have
to
transfer
their
loyalty
from
general
motor
to
another
manufac
turer
they
could
simply
switch
to
another
of
general
motor
brand
we
thought
the
market
for
mobile
phone
would
evolve
along
similar
line
as
indeed
have
happen
for
many
product
since
the

the
world
be
no
longer
one
gray
mass
but
be
differentiate
into
a

accord
to
taste
and

and
this
offer
many
new
opportunity
our
reorga

put
seize
those

at
the

i
n
we
realize
that
we
definitely
have
a
new
competitor
in
the

it
be
base
in
redmond
in

its

microsoft
have
emerge
from
the
shadow
in
the

an
nounced
then
that
it
intend
to
move
into
two
new
area

the
first
be

that

otherwise

would
continue

reign
supreme
in

elec
tronics
microsoft
s
second
target
be
mobile
phone
where
it
didn
t
want
nokia
to
dominate
the
software
and
hence
the
consumer
soul
microsoft
didn
t
use
those
exact
word
but
that
be
how
we
interpret
their
action
at
nokia
microsoft
have
announce
that
it
be
come
to
our
patch
and
we
knew
they
played
a
hard
game
microsoft
have
become
an
icon
of
the
s
and
s
and
a
monument
to
american
enterprise
it
have
also
grown
into
a
colossus
of
the
market
and
go
on
the
attack
and
defend
itself
from
attack
with
vary
degree
of
success
the

on
protect
its
source
code

de
fend
its
right
in
every
part
of
the

microsoft
s
culture
didn
t
have
much
in
common
with
nokia
s
it
be
a
pure
software
company
whose
cash
flow
come
from
licensing
payment
in
the
value
chain
microsoft
dominate
one
horizontal
element
namely
software
nokia
on
the
other
hand
grow
through
its
product
mobile
phone
for
which
it
developed
ever
more
so
phisticated
software
as
phone
become
more
complex
by
our
mobile
phone
have
capability
similar
to
those
of
small
computer
our
commu
nicator
in
particular
be
interoperable
with
computer
and
with
microsoft
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
software
since
it
be
only
useful
to
an
executive
if
information
could
readily
be
transfer
between
it
and
a
computer
we
have
actively
sought
out
area
of
cooperation
pekka
ala
pietil
and
his
team
held
discussion
at
microsoft
from
these
have
come
the
idea
of
a
wireless
phone
with
an
internet
connection
for
office
use
this
project
begin
in
but
it
be
quickly
drop
as
it
become
clear
that
there
wouldn
t
be
much
demand
for
the
product
after
that
we
agree
that
nokia
s
smart
phone
would
also
work
in
the
microsoft
outlook
environment
this
didn
t
call
for
particularly
dramatic
step
since
both
side
have
much
to
gain
from
the
deal
and
we
quickly
reach
an
agreement
it
be
an
ordinary
business
decision
in
the
founder
and
chairman
of
microsoft
bill
gate
introduce
the
stinger
phone
and
promise
that
it
would
be
available
by
the
end
of
microsoft
be
try
to
win
over
nokia
s
competitor
they
held
discussion
with
at
least
motorola
and
sony
ericsson
they
didn
t
succeed
but
they
do
collaborate
with
samsung
to
some
degree
and
they
make
arrangement
for
the
production
of
the
stinger
the
phone
be
never
launch
however
but
be
bury
in
the
graveyard
where
stillborn
technology
project
be
laid
to
rest
microsoft
have
want
to
supply
software
for
mobile
phone
but
we
want
ed
to
develop
the
software
ourselves
the
major
mobile
phone
manufactur
er
have
set
up
a
software
company
call
symbian
for
that
purpose
when
we
realize
what
microsoft
be
try
to
do
we
focus
our
software
devel
opment
ever
more
on
symbian
its
first
achievement
be
the
camera
phone
launch
in
other
company
such
as
sony
ericsson
siemens
and
samsung
also
invest
more
money
in
symbian
when
microsoft
notice
that
it
be
difficult
to
fight
against
symbian
it
change
its
strategy
once
more
this
time
it
focus
on
operating
system
nokia
s
countermove
be
to
bring
together
the
open
mobile
architecture
forum
which
attract
two
hundred
practitioner
from
the
mobile
phone
market
and
elsewhere
this
be
such
a
high
profile
move
that
microsoft
saw
that
it
have
to
give
up
its
dream
of
single
handedly
dominate
the
mar
ket
for
mobile
phone
software
compete
with
microsoft
be
never
easy
we
have
the
resource
need
to
do
it
but
once
again
we
come
up
against
cultural
difference
the
big
problem
be
the
software
development
community
microsoft
could
mo
bilize
a
million
software
developer
where
we
could
call
on
fifty
or
a
hun
dred
thousand
at
best
symbian
seriously
lag
behind
microsoft
in
this
i
met
bill

the
first
time
in

it

medium
industry
executive
together
i
don
t

against
all
odds
have
any
particular
mental
image
of
gate
he
may
well
have
seem
just
as
i
have
expect
he
be
more
focus
on
technology
than
on
lead
people
i
invite
gate
to
finland
and
he

after
one
of
his
own
success
story
we
be
certainly
microsoft

big
customer
in
finland
and
powerpoint
perhaps
loom
a
little
too
large
in
what
we
do
sometimes
i
ban
its
use
when
we
be
work
on
strategy
because
it
too
readily
become
a
substitute
for
independent
thought
we
sat
in
our
conference
room
for
an
hour
and

in
the
summer
of
even
so
i
be
satisfied
with
my
conversation
with
bill
gate
if
we
have
start
to
discus
coopera
tion
with
microsoft
two
year
earlier
they
would
have
eat
us
for
breakfast
we
want
to
be
in
a
position
where
we
would
be
play
with
a
reasonably
strong
hand
our
strategy
of
defend
open
source
software
and
cooperate
with
many
manufacturer
have
paid
off
we
have
also
manage
to
keep
control
of
our
own
software
development
microsoft
have
perhaps
begin
to
understand
that
mobile
phone
weren
t
as
simple
as
laptop
computer
in
a
mobile
phone
the
software
and
the
device
itself
be
almost
indis
tinguishable
you
couldn
t
tell
where
the
software
start
and
the
hardware
end
the
mobile
phone
have
already
start
to
become
a
personal
product
in
which
the
design
feature
software
and
user
interface
be
package
into
the
small
possible
product
which
be
also
a
brand
in
itself
nokia
be
on
top
of
all
this
while
for
microsoft
it
be
unknown
territory
micro
soft
be
a
software
company
which
have
developed
product
that
the
whole
world
depend
on
nokia
do
its
best
to
create
attractive
product
that
would
appeal
to
individual
consumer
in
an
extremely
competitive
market
we
agree
with
bill
gate
that
almost
everything
possible
in
our
world
be
go
badly
the
phone
operator
be
in
a
bad
way
nokia
s
competi
tor
have
become
weaker
and
we
have
our
own
problem
though
i
wouldn
t
have
use
quite
those
word
to
bill
gate
it
would
be
a
pity
if
our
action
or
argument
splinter
the
market
so
that
there
would
no
longer
be
just
one
single
market
for
mobile
phone
i
say
gate
suggest
we
discus
what
it
be
that
microsoft
do
that
annoyed
nokia
and
vice
versa
what
annoys
me
about
microsoft
be
that
you
believe
you
can
use
the
same
value
chain
for
mobile
phone
as
you
use
to
create
personal
computer
but
they
re
two
very
different
thing
our
model
of
vertical
integration
be
de
sign
to
produce
phone
that
appeal
to
consumer
i
say
i
didn
t
say
that
the
way
microsoft
be
act
be
hostile
to
nokia
though
in
reality
it
be

against
all
odds
in
many
decision
on
standard
you
ve
opt
for
something
other
than
the
microsoft
model
you
ve
chosen
java
technology
and
realplayer
for
your
phone
gate
say
in
his
turn
that
s
true
i
reply
in
a
conciliatory
tone
but
now
i
m
sit
at
this
table
in
order
to
look
again
at
these
issue
that
s
what
compatibility
be
about
i
say
we
spent
twenty
minute
or
so
on
these
painful
question
then
we
sketch
out
a
direction
for
future
discussion
on
a
notepad
we
also
agree
that
pekka
ala
pietil
and
pertti
korhonen
would
soon
get
in
touch
to
discus
strategy
with
their
counterpart
at
mi
crosoft
two
year
earlier
microsoft
have
intend
to
capture
the
market
for
mo
bile
phone
software
come
what
may
and
push
nokia
into
the
sea
the
only
question
have
be
which
sea
bill
gate
would
choose
for
that
purpose
now
his
approach
have
change
and
all
the
arrogance
have
go
from
the
think
of
the
world
s
big
technology
company
there
be
two
moment
in
our
discussion
when
gate
get
jittery
the
first
be
of
no
significance
the
second
be
when
he
shout
as
he
told
me
that
three
month
earlier
nokia
have
support
a
court
indictment
against
mi
crosoft
we
have
to
decide
whether
to
intervene
to
give
microsoft
a
chance
to
offer
an
expert
opinion
in
a
court
case
i
have
conclude
that
nokia
shouldn
t
get
mixed
up
in
courtroom
dispute
between
microsoft
and
the
u
s
federal
government
that
we
shouldn
t
intervene
it
wasn
t
our
business
but
perhaps
our
representative
have
say
something
incautious
in
the
corridor
that
have
found
its
way
up
to
bill
gate
finally
i
ask
why
microsoft
have
end
its
cooperation
with
sony
er
icsson
cooperation
have
start
a
couple
of
year
earlier
but
have
come
to
a
sudden
end
after
a
short
time
it
wasn
t
go
anywhere
it
s
impossible
to
work
with
a
company
that
s
fall
to
piece
the
whole
time
gate
say
in
his
straightforward
way
directness
be
the
gate
trademark
by
which
i
have
learn
to
know
him
i
knew
it
be
well
to
be
with
him
than
against
him
i
also
knew
that
if
our
effort
at
cooperation
didn
t
work
microsoft
would
ac
quire
fifty
or
so
tank
from
somewhere
and
try
to
crush
nokia
beneath
their
track
bill
gate
be
a
typical
exemplar
of
andy
grove
s
famous
dictum
that
only
the
paranoid
survive
microsoft
s
method
have
be
extremely
brutal
but
its
software
have
create
entirely
new
way
of
work
and
processing
in
formation
i
have
respect
bill
gate
s
clear
intelligence
and
willpower
when
i
first
met
him
in
but
four
year
later
i
knew
that
microsoft
wasn
t
invincible
we
realize
that
we
would
never
make
money
in
the
wireless
world
gate
say
now
i
drew
a
deep
breath
i
knew
that
nokia
have
reach
a
critical
point
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
we
shook
hand
after
a
long
discussion
i
picked
up
my
mobile
phone
bill
gate
his
laptop
and
the
mineral
water
bottle
remain
on
the
table
peace
descend
on
the
sage
room
as
i
return
with
gate
to
the
dinner
table
in
sun
valley

against
all
odds
chapter
back
to
reality
w
e
have
reconfigured
nokia
so
the
company
could
seize
opportu
nities
for
new
growth
we
believe
that
the
nine
new
business
unit
be
focus
on
the
area
where
growth
would
be
found
we
be
look
for
growth
over
five
year
since
we
didn
t
know
how
long
our
current
crisis
would
last
our
key
aim
be
to
build
up
our
software
capa
bility
so
we
could
develop
more
complex
product
we
thought
that
mobile
phone
user
should
be
able
to
read
email
take
picture
and
even
regulate
their
heartbeat
we
be
gear
up
for
a
battle
with
microsoft
for
supremacy
of
the
wire
less
world
if
we
hadn
t
played
our
card
right
i
would
have
be
in
no
posi
tion
to
take
on
bill
gate
when
i
met
him
in
the
summer
of
we
have
won
our
battle
with
microsoft
even
though
we
didn
t
yet
know
the
final
result
at
the
end
of
microsoft
s
british
partner
sendo
switch
side
the
company
accuse
microsoft
of
steal
its
business
secret
work
on
the
smartphone
that
the
two
company
have
developed
together
come
to
an
end
just
before
the
phone
be
due
to
be
launch
we
seem
safe
from
attack
about
this
time
the
economist
write
about
a
new
type
of
information
technology
its
cover
feature
not
a
laptop
com
puter
with
microsoft
software
but
nokia
s
new
phone
we
be
do
well
in
this
battle
but
for
some
reason
we
didn
t
notice
that
the
real
war
be
tak
ing
place
somewhere
else
company
usually
make
mistake
because
they
focus
too
much
on
the
short
term
future
our
mistake
be
the
opposite
we
be
think
too
hard
about
what
the
world
would
look
like
in
five
year
we
be
lose
our
grip
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
on
what
might
happen
next
year
we
believe
our
customer
would
move
to
more
sophisticated
and
smarter
phone
and
at
least
in
developed
market
leave
the
simpler
model
behind
we
expect
cheap
phone
to
be
dominant
in
develop
market
we
have
set
up
a
unit
to
focus
on
just
those
market
which
be
where
all
the
growth
in
the
world
s
mobile
phone
market
would
come
from
in
february
we
launch
an
entirely
new
line
of
nokia
product
phone
on
which
you
could
play
game
we
call
it
n
gage
it
have
be
nokia
s
dream
to
extend
its
range
from
phone
to
game
console
you
could
load
game
on
to
the
new
phone
by
insert
a
diskette
it
look
more
like
a
game
console
than
a
phone
and
it
be
aim
at
people
age
sixteen
to
thirty
five
as
well
as
game
and
a
phone
it
contain
a
radio
a
music
player
and
a
web
browser
for
technical
reason
use
it
to
make
call
be
a
little
awkward
since
you
have
to
point
its
narrow
edge
toward
your
ear
n
gage
have
a
big
marketing
budget
the
phone
have
be
design
by
anssi
vanjoki
s
unit
and
anssi
be
a
marketing
professional
if
anyone
be
it
be
a
rare
individual
at
nokia
who
wish
to
or
would
have
dare
disagree
with
anssi
on
a
marketing
matter
the
n
gage
be
launch
to
a
great
fan
fare
at
the
london
eye
the
giant
ferris
wheel
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
thames
n
gage
receive
a
crush
reception
from
the
very
people
who
should
have
fall
in
love
with
it
young
people
thought
it
look
like
a
taco
go
wrong
as
a
phone
it
be
rather
clumsy
because
it
be
too
big
and
the
way
you
have
to
hold
it
to
make
a
call
seem
ridiculous
the
selection
of
game
be
too
narrow
and
unsatisfactory
in
other
respect
i
even
heard
of
one
thirteen
year
old
boy
who
after
he
have
see
our
splendid
new
game
phone
recommend
to
his
father
that
he
sell
his
nokia
share
we
try
to
put
on
a
brave
face
we
put
more
money
into
marketing
and
of
course
we
receive
some
positive
or
at
least
neutral
publicity
we
also
start
to
think
about
what
we
might
do
with
the
n
gage
and
why
thing
have
go
as
they
have
perhaps
we
hadn
t
fully
understood
our
new
custom
er
or
perhaps
it
wasn
t
as
easy
for
nokia
to
move
from
phone
to
game
console
as
we
have
imagine
we
believe
we
have
create
something
new
that
would
rewrite
the
rule
of
the
game
we
be
sure
we
have
succeed
in
that
but
our
customer
take
a
different
view
the
sale
figure
for
n
gage
fell
far
short
of
our
target
of
course
we
learn
many
new
thing
though
some
of
that
knowledge
be
quite
expen
sive
n
gage
cost
us
around
million
which
may
sound
like
a
great
deal
of
money
but
it
s
worth
remember
that
at
that
time
nokia
s
cash
flow

against
all
odds
be
around
million
a
month
n
gage
be
our
big
single
individual
investment
of
those
year
it
wasn
t
a
success
but
partly
through
nokia
s
sup
port
finland
gain
significant
expertise
in
game
design
in
recent
year
finnish
company
such
as
rovio
and
supercell
have
again
show
how
fin
land
can
compete
at
the
top
level
our
mistake
be
not
that
we
take
too
big
a
risk
but
that
we
make
a
loss
our
mistake
be
that
we
didn
t
take
big
enough
risk
when
it
would
have
be
cheap
to
take
them
nokia
s
great
profitability
meant
that
our
cash
re
serf
have
grown
so
big
that
stock
exchange
analyst
kept
demand
to
know
how
the
money
might
be
return
to
the
shareholder
to
whom
it
really
belong
our
focus
on
the
n
gage
and
other
multimedia
product
cost
us
dearly
in
that
spring
we
also
launch
a
new
medium
phone
which
be
a
fine
product
but
it
also
fail
to
achieve
much
success
we
be
perhaps
a
little
too
early
once
again
it
be
only
a
little
later
that
game
and
medium
content
become
common
in
phone
in
i
take
a
two
week
summer
holiday
which
be
a
record
i
hadn
t
have
such
a
peaceful
break
since
in
we
have
acquire
a
new
holiday
home
a
manor
house
on
a
lake
about
seventy
mile
northeast
of
helsinki
i
look
out
over
the
lake
and
realize
how
much
i
need
a
holiday
we
have
acquire
a
puppy
teri
and
training
her
seem
much
more
demand
ing
than
run
a
global
company
she
be
still
bursting
with
puppyish
life
and
energy
and
disobedience
these
quality
be
less
in
evidence
at
nokia
i
have
set
major
organizational
change
in
motion
at
nokia
i
assume
that
splitting
the
mobile
phone
division
into
nine
small
unit
would
be
enough
and
would
soon
lead
to
fresh
growth
now
i
have
to
admit
that
i
have
be
wrong
i
should
have
overhaul
the
whole
of
nokia
not
just
the
way
mobile
phone
be
organize
besides
the
new
division
of
responsibility
be
point
us
in
the
wrong
direction
we
have
focus
on
complicate
smartphones
and
on
cheap
model
for
market
in
the
develop
world
but
between
the
two
there
remain
a
key
market
for
mid
range
phone
and
we
hadn
t
paid
enough
attention
to
that
on
top
of
that
in
early
our
relationship
with
the
mobile
network
operator
have
deteriorate
they
want
us
to
deliver
tailor
phone
as
other
manufacturer
have
but
that
wasn
t
our
prefer
approach
the
opera
tor
want
specialized
software
for
mid
range
phone
such
as
high
reso
lution
color
screen
and
other
high
quality
feature
we
be
gear
up
to
deliver
large
number
of
new
phone
but
we
couldn
t
meet
the
requirement
until
also
many
operating
company
thought
nokia
have
become
too
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
strong
a
company
they
have
difficulty
of
their
own
since
the
new
g
net
work
have
yet
to
make
a
return
on
investment
nokia
have
small
competitor
who
be
ready
to
comply
with
the
op
erating
company
tiniest
wish
we
have
grown
so
big
that
every
one
of
our
competitor
have
just
one
aim
to
attack
nokia
s
market
share
and
push
us
off
our
pedestal
we
have
give
many
of
our
competitor
the
tool
to
do
just
that
every
new
product
that
fail
or
be
late
every
customer
complaint
and
every
critical
review
give
them
something
to
smile
about
in
the
boardroom
of
samsung
and
motorola
as
well
as
the
reorganization
i
have
make
another
decision
i
would
leave
nokia
in
whatever
happen
my
contract
would
have
make
it
po
sible
for
me
to
stay
on
if
the
board
and
i
both
want
that
but
i
have
decide
to
do
something
else
back
in
i
didn
t
have
any
idea
at
all
what
that
might
be
for
now
i
want
to
put
nokia
back
in
shape
and
on
the
path
to
growth
one
more
time
only
then
could
i
leave
the
company
to
my
successor
it
also
seem
to
me
that
i
could
no
longer
summon
up
as
much
enthusiasm
as
i
need
to
and
the
five
have
work
together
long
enough
nokia
need
to
enter
a
new
phase
something
have
to
be
do
this
wasn
t
the
first
time
i
d
found
myself
in
this
position
i
have
turn
the
company
around
twice
already
i
have
make
surprising
organizational
change
and
i
have
make
all
the
necessary
move
at
the
necessary
time
to
my
own
satisfac
tion
of

i
hadn

all
this

i
have
to
give
every

of

a

message
about
the

the

with

if
we

in
we
would
never
have

of
the

but
neither
would
we
have

we
do
in

a

can

objective
of

such
as
promote

on
one
hand
and
put
the
right
system
in

on
the
other
a
company
can
t
instruct
its
worker
to
step
on
the

and
the
accelerator
at
the

time
it

the
job
of
senior
management
to
see

they
should
change
the

it

perhaps
we
should

be
satisfied
with
a
little
less
growth
and
left
some
energy
for
im
prove
our

but
that
s
a
hard
message
to
get
across
when
people
be
relish

make
the
most
of

new
product

will
never

people
who
develop
system
as
much
as
it
value
those
who
innovate
or
sell
thing
someone
who
develops
a
new
internal
accounting
system
will
rarely
receive
the
same
respect
and
recognition
as
someone
who
have
just
sell
a
million
phone
it
s
the
job
of
a
company
s
board
to
strike
a
balance
between
these
different
factor
as
the
chief
executive
responsibility
for
that
ultimately
rest
with
me
in
march
i
begin
to
sketch
out
a
new
organizational
structure
my
core
group
gather
each
morning
in
my
meeting
room
the
day
be
lengthen
the
sun
have
risen
sometime
around
seven
and
would
set
again
an
hour
or
two
after
most
people
get
home
from
work
the
finnish
spring
be
a
good
time
for
everything
new
because
the
light
increase
so
rapidly
from
day
to
day
we
sketch
possible
model
on
notepad
but
didn
t
worry
about
who
would
go
where
our
discussion
concerned
only
what
would
be
the
best
structure
for
nokia
regardless
of
who
would
do
what
the
time
to
con
sider
individual
role
would
come
later
i
want
to
have
that
discussion
with
everyone
separately
i
already
have
some
idea
of
my
own
on
where
people
should
go
which
would
become
clear
later
on
the
discussion
go
well
and
take
the
reorganization
forward
rapidly
the
model
be
a
simple
but
ambitious
matrix
many
people
would
now
find
themselves
work
with
their
colleague
rather
than
compete
against
them
for
the
good
of
nokia
that
would
demand
a
new
maturity
by
august
i
knew
which
individual
would
change
their
job
in
a
way
i
also
have
to
take
a
stance
on
who
my
successor
would
be
because
the
new
ar
rangements
would
have
an
impact
on
who
held
power
within
nokia
some
people
would
find
themselves
in
a
strong
position
while
others
would
find
their
position
unchanged
or
apparently
weaken
but
i
didn
t
want
to
have
the
press
place
bet
on
who
my
successor
would
be
indeed
my
successor
could
in
principle
come
from
outside
the
matrix
two
of
the
five
would
not
be
part
of
the
group
from
which
my
successor
would
come
they
be
matti
alahuhta

baldauf

and
i
agree
at
her
request
that
she
would
leave

in
matti
would
move
to
become
the
director
responsible

would

we
could
teach

the

could
the

operator
and
the

carry
on
an
in
terminable
debate
over
who
own
the
customer
inside
nokia
s
mobile
phone
unit
there
be
conflict
view
on
this
the
more
fundamentalist
type
thought
that
the
operator
be
in
much
the
same
position
as
compa
ny
that
make
railway
sleeper
their
view
be
that
the
operating

didn
t
add
any
value
for
the

with
lot
of

the

because

and
content

in
the

that
be
how
mo

many
people
do
understand
the
role
the
mobile
network
operator
played
in
business
close
to
percent
of
phone
be
sell
by
the
operator
the
operator
saw
and
knew
what
be
happen
in
the
market
so
it
be
worth
listen
closely
to
what
they
have
to
tell
us
in
the
summer
of
the
operator
concern
reach
our
ear
their
trade
association

adopt
a
more
critical
tone
nokia

rapidly
become
their
public
enemy
number
one
one
of
their

call
on
us
to
say
that
they
want
to
buy
clamshell

but
all
nokia
have
to
offer
be
the
familiar
candy
bar
model
nokia
have
already
start
to
design
a
clamshell
phone
but
it
be
run
late
once
again
we
have
decide
to
do
everything
ourselves
even
though
we
hadn
t
previously
make
clamshell
or
hinge
model
for
the
mid

jorma
ollila
and

market
we
encounter
many
technical
difficulty
that
we
try
to
explain
to
our
friend
but
we
didn
t
take
their
concern
seriously
enough
in
in
september
the
anti
nokia
front
gain
strength
many
operating
company
fear
that
nokia
would
tread
on
their
toe
as
it
developed
its
nokia
club
concept
customer
would
find
themselves
direct
to
nokia
s
web
page
rather
than
to
the
operating
company
page
our
initiative
have
never
be
direct
against
the
operator
but
to
some
it
look
as
if
it
have
the
board
of
the
association
of
mobile
network

at

of

where
several
major
operator
declare
open
war
on

their
war
cry
be
kill

the
phrase
undoubtedly
contain
more
rhetoric
than
reality
but
it
reflect
the
think
among
the
operator
our
friend
in
the
world
of
the
mobile

get
back
in

he
be
worried
about
what
the
future
would
hold
for
nokia
if
its
relationship
with
the
operating
company
didn
t
improve
he
have
take
it
upon
himself
to
tell
us
what
be
bother
the
operating
company
from

he
rang
matti
alahuhta
and
say
that
death
threat
be
rain
down
on

from
every
direction
matti
take
his
concern
seriously
which
lead
to
an
immediate
reappraisal
in
the
mobile
phone
unit
the
operator
concern
have
register
with
nokia
but
our
reaction
speed
left
much
to
be
desire
one
of
the
world
s
large
operating
company
vodafone
be
in
the
van

of
the

it
easy
to

with
it
the

secret

in
cannes
in

when
over
a
hundred

gather
for
their

they
simply
agree
to
reduce
their
purchase
from

a
cer

they
want
to
teach

someone

the

be
clear
on
that
point
however
this
wasn

a

a
recommendation
for
a
common
action

in

nokia

small
business
week
be
really
talk
of
past
glory
when
it
place
nokia
sixth
in
its
annual
survey
of
the
world
s
most
valuable
brand
it
be
the
most
valuable
in

and
the
most
valuable
mobile

company
our
profitability
and
market
share
remain
high
how
ever
it
felt
as
if
we
be
lose
the
battle
on
several
front
in
november
i
give
an
interview
to
the
wall
street
journal
they
ask
what
kept
me
awake
at
night
i
reply
that
i
always
slept
well
even
on
airplane
i
say
i
be
ponder
what
would
happen
in
the
next
three
or
four
year
in
and
everyone
have
believe
in
the
triumph
of
tech
nology
until
september
change
everything
thus
my
worry
be
whether
nokia
be
structure
to
absorb
every
unexpected
change
the
fol
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
low
year
would
undoubtedly
bring
i
couldn
t
know
what
those
change
might
be
but
i
reckon
that
any
surprise
be
likely
to
come
either
from
technology
or
from
nokia
s
competitor
it
be
a
good
guess
i
still
didn
t
have
the
faintest
idea
of
what
await
us
as
we
enter
everything
look
good
at
the
begin
of
january
the
last
quarter
of
have
be
a
good
period
our
result
be
well
than
they
have
be
for
a
long
time
when
i
return
to
nokia
after
my
christmas
break
morale
be
high
our
order
book
be
still
full
in
the
first
week
of
january
in
the
second
week
there
be
a
turn
for
the
bad
we
didn
t
get
any
or
ders
our
phone
weren
t
sell
as
we
have
expect
thing
didn
t
get
well
the
follow
week
either
this
wasn
t
a
good
start
to
the
year
i
quickly
real
ized
something
be
wrong
these
situation
have
their
own
charm
i
feel
energize
when
i
can
roll
up
my
sleeve
and
solve
problem
and
i
expect
a
great
deal
from
the
people
around
me
they
have
to
carry
heavy
responsibility
and
make
almost
su
perhuman
effort
but
innovation
and
failure
be
both
permit
if
people
give
everything
in
a
crisis
you
can
t
punish
them
if
they
make
mistake
at
nokia
i
ve
always
try
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
demand
i
make
and
the
excitement
that
work
can
bring
we
won
t
achieve
anything
if
we
don
t
expect
enough
from
people
but
we
would
quickly
lose
good
people
if
they
didn
t
enjoy
their
work
this
balance
be
absolutely
essential
in
a
crisis
the
chief
executive
s
job
be
to
show
by
their
own
behavior
and
action
what
s
important
they
have
to
go
where
change
have
to
be
make
they
also
have
to
admit
where
the
company
have
make
mistake
and
where
they
have
make
mistake
but
they
must
also
look
ahead
to
the
future
they
must
demand
systematic
result
when
the
crisis
begin
to
be
resolve
their
decision
have
to
be
right
and
proportionate
everyone
have
to
do
their
bit
but
not
more
in
a
crisis
no
one
want
leader
who
be
weak
or
have
lose
their
nerve
it
soon
become
clear
that
the
mobile
network
operator
be
act
on
their
threat
their
share
of
nokia
sale
in
europe
be
usually
around
percent
they
have
decide
to
bring
that
down
to
percent
the
major
com
panies
be
reduce
their
purchase
but
the
small
one
be
buying
as
many
phone
as
before
when
we
calculate
the
impact
of
the
partial
boy
cott
we
found
that
our
market
share
in
europe
have
fall
by
percentage
point
in
six
month
the
meeting
at
cannes
in
february
have
sent
a
message
to
nokia
which
we
have
most
certainly
receive
nokia
fell
off
its
pedestal
in
a
matter
of
week
the
operating
company
smart
weapon
have
hit
its
target

against
all
odds
with
destructive
force
our
market
share
have
fall
from
percent
in
to
percent
in
nokia
start
to
do
its
homework
our
discussion
with
the
operating
company
begin
on
a
new
basis
if
we
have
show
arrogance
in
the
past
we
certainly
couldn
t
afford
it
now
i
divide
responsibility
for
deal
with
individual
operating
company
between
the
member
of
our
management
team
i
want
my
most
experienced
colleague
to
report
directly
to
me
on
their
dealing
with
specific
operator
i
jumped
on
plane
to
meet
the
most
important
company
myself
i
talk
through
our
problem
with
vodafone
at
their
head
office
i
want
to
show
them
that
we
be
serious
and
be
offering
a
concrete
response
to
their
concern
the
world
would
have
be
a
simpler
place
if
we
could
have
blame
our
difficulty
entirely
on
our
relationship
with
the
operating
company
un
fortunately
we
have
to
look
in
the
mirror
there
we
could
see
an
inadequate
range
of
product
defective
process
carelessness
and
arrogance
on
top
of
that
we
have
concentrate
so
hard
on
maintain
our
profit
ability
that
we
be
shut
ourselves
out
of
expand
market
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
compete
in
the
market
for
mid
range
phone
really
it
be
only
now
that
mid
range
phone
have
appear
they
be
a
new
phenomenon
for
us
all
they
didn
t
compete
on
the
basis
of
their
new
application
they
compete
on
the
basis
of
their
design
and
physical
property
they
be
call
flip
phone
or
clamshell
phone
because
they
open
with
the
aid
of
a
hinge
our
competitor
have
try
in
various
way
to
destroy
nokia
by
chang
ing
the
rule
of
the
game
now
the
clamshell
phone
brought
them
success
the
phone
weren
t
a
step
forward
in
technical
term
but
they
offer
a
different
experience
to
customer
use
old
technology
the
fault
for
nokia
s
problem
also
lay
in
our
organization
for
which
i
be
responsible
in
matti
alahuhta
be
in
overall
charge
of
mobile
phone
but
anssi
vanjoki
be
responsible
for
the
product
development
and
report
to
matti
with
hindsight
this
arrangement
turn
out
to
have
be
our
achilles
heel
matti
and
anssi
be
and
be
very
different
in
their
approach
to
leader
ship
matti
be
a
strategist
who
like
to
work
thing
through
to
their
conclu
sion
while
anssi
move
fast
like
a
cruise
missile
he
work
on
the
basis
of
intuition
pay
close
attention
to
market
signal
anssi
be
a
strong
believer
in
smartphones
and
didn
t
believe
at
all
in
clamshell
phone
he
thought
we
ought
to
make
a
handful
of
them
because
the
operator
seem
to
want
them
but
basically
he
believe
that
clamshell
phone
be
a
passing
fad
he
turn
out
to
be
right
but
that
didn
t
help
nokia
when
our
competi
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
tor
clamshell
be
nibble
away
at
our
market
share
and
profitability
we
didn
t
have
the
phone
on
the
market
we
should
have
have
matti
alahuhta
be
commit
to
produce
nokia
s
own
clamshell
phone
but
matti
and
anssi
couldn
t
find
enough
common
ground
for
the
investment
that
be
need
for
position
the
new
product
in
the
market
and
for
allocate
the
necessary
resource
the
upshot
be
a
failure
to

we
be
out
of
the
game
in
this
particular
competition
asian

especially
samsung
make
money
from
clamshell
phone
which
go
down
very
well
with
young
people
in
asia
and
beyond
this
wasn
t
nokia
s
only
problem
our
arch
rival
motorola
rise
again
thanks
to
a
phone
call
the
motorola
razr
the
american
ingeniously
combine
three
thing
a
large
screen
a
slender
body
and
a
clamshell
case
all
this
be
wrap
up
in
a
marketing
campaign
that
have
touch
of
genius
the
razr
start
out
as
a
phone
aim
at
rich
and
tech
savvy
customer
at
the
upper
end
of
the
market
then
motorola
lower
the
product
s
price
and
the
result
spoke
for
themselves
the
phone
be
design
in
launch
in
and
by
there
be
million
of
them
in
use
eventually
mil
lion
razr
phone
would
be
sell
a
record
for
a
clamshell
for
the
second
time
in
nokia
s
recent
history
we
have
to
examine
the
anat
omy
of
the
clamshell
because
motorola
have
surprised
us
the
previous
time
have
be
when
pertti
korhonen
take
a
motorola
phone
to
bit
in
nokia
s
oulu
laboratory
back
in
now
there
be
no
need
to
disassemble
a
phone
because
we
could
already
see
what
have
happen
in
nokia
finally
succeed
in
produce
a
clamshell
phone
for
the
european
market
six
month
late
some
people
predict
that
in
a
few
year
half
the
world
s
mobile
phone
would
be
clamshell
model
the
clamshell
have
become
a
dangerous
beast
of
prey
which
nokia
attempt
to
domesti
cate
much
too
late
our
first
clamshell
phone
couldn
t
compete
samsung
have
achieve
not
just
lift
off
it
have
practically
go
into
orbit
on
the
fuel
provide
by
its
clamshell
phone
they
be
now
in
their
third
or
even
fourth
generation
samsung
knew
how
to
stuff
its
mid
range
phone
full
of
feature
that
would
appeal
to
consumer
camera
big
screen
and
design
that
be
easy
to
use
and
work
well
suddenly
nokia
s
phone
be
no
longer
entice
we
have
thought
once
more
that
we
could
change
the
rule
of
the
game
and
everyone
else
would
fall
into
line
when
we
decide
to
make
our
clamshell
phone
we
want
it
to
be
different
from
everyone
else
s
so
we
developed
a
new
type
of
hinge
we
try
to
go
through
two
stage
in
one
leap
the
new

against
all
odds
phone
too
be
notably
late
and
we
have
come
up
with
such
expensive
solu
tions
that
the
customer
weren
t
satisfied
they
wouldn
t
pay
extra
for
our
education
in
the
fine
art
of
clamshell
phone
we
should
have
thought
longer
and
harder
about
what
customer
real
ly
want
look
back
it
appear
that
customer
didn
t
want
clamshell
phone
as
such
what
they
want
be
phone
that
look
and
felt
different
and
new
if
a
customer
have
bought
a
phone
cost
a
year
or
two
back
we
should
have
come
up
with
a
much
well
phone
that
would
cost
now
all
we
have
to
offer
be
a
supermodel
cost
we
be
victim
of
our
own
elementary
mistake
my
agony
intensified
responsibility
for
the
mobile
phone
unit
have
move
to
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
and
i
knew
he
would
get
thing
right
there
be
a
profit
warn
ahead
which
would
knock
billion
off
our
market
val
ue
the
press
be
say
that
i
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
that
i
have
be
in
a
couple
of
year
earlier
we
have
to
make
some
major
correction
the
ceo
of
a
company
can
never
escape
responsibility
for
his
or
her
own
mistake
on
april
i
make
a
conference
call
explain
to
shareholder
where
we
stood
i
have
travel
the
previous
day
to
atlanta
to
meet
one
of
our
important
customer
cingular
from
there
i
flew
to
new
york
in
the
even
i
woke
at
five
in
the
morning
to
read
my
paper
have
breakfast
at
the
peninsula
hotel
at
seven
and
knew
then
that
i
have
a
long
and
arduous
day
ahead
there
be
a
shortage
of
financial
news
only
the
result
for
rupert
murdoch
s
newscorp
and
for
nokia
be
due
i
could
see
that
we
would
attract
a
great
deal
of
attention
all
of
it
negative
the
bad
of
it
be
that
i
couldn
t
really
make
promise
to
anyone
all
i
could
do
be
repeat
the
same
message
to
the
investor
thing
be
under
control
we
re
do
the
right
thing
this
be
a
much
small
crisis
than
the
one
we
face
in
but
i
didn
t
know
when
our
profit
would
improve
or
to
what
extent
all
i
could
do
and
it
be
what
i
want
to
do
be
trust
our
new
organization
it
have
to
succeed
otherwise
everything
would
go
badly
for
us
my
stomach
be
burning
for
three
or
four
day
at
least
my
body
understood
what
be
up
the
first
thing
we
do
be
something
straight
out
of
textbook
if
your
good
don
t
sell
you
should
drop
the
price
our
phone
be
well
package
and
command
premium
price
we
could
afford
to
sell
them
more
cheap
ly
though
that
might
go
against
our
traditional
principle
a
price
cut
would
stop
our
market
share
crumble
though
of
course
the
market
wouldn
t
like
the
move
our
profitability
would
also
be
in
danger
the
crucial
thing
be
to
crank
our
machinery
into
action
at
its
heart
sat
a
group
of
product
director

if
for
example
we
want
to
create
a

for

cost
it
would
be
up
to
the

a

a
company
could
make
i
bore
my
own
responsibility
for
them
the
crisis
in
show
that
we
have
to
stick
coolly
and
deliberately
to
our
own
line
regardless
of
what
anyone
else
might
say
that
do
not
how
ever
mean
withdrawal
from
reality
from
customer
from
market
from
the
right
technology
building
a
major
company
mean
humility
practicality
flexibility
alertness
and
responsiveness
although
nokia
make
mistake
get
back
on
the
right
track
be
possible
we
found
in
spring
that
the
company
could
be
guide
we
could
still
dispense
with
the
automatic
pilot
if
we
need
to
by
june
our
figure
still
hadn
t
improve
in
july
we
issue
our
result
for
the
first
six
month
and
our
share
price
slump
far
but
july
be
also
the
turn
point
this
wasn
t
visible
in
the
first
week
of
the
month
but
by
the
second
week
when
practically
every
finn
be
on
holiday
nokia
s
figure
seem
to
be
turn
the
corner
the
battle
have
perhaps
be
won
after
all
in
that
year
we
didn
t
manage
to
address
the
reason
for
our
failure
we
alter
our
course
but
it
take
time
to
implement
last
change
by
we
be
back
on
track
for
growth
at
the
begin
of
we
succeed
in
improve
our
market
share
and
our
profitability
and
nokia
be
once
again
a
grow
company
it
have
take
a
year
and
a
half
we
have
however
learn
something
from
our
earlier
crisis
even
though
one
of
the
most
important
thing
we
d
learn
be
that
crisis
don
t
resemble
each
other
in
there
hadn
t
be
time
to
weigh
alternative
because
nokia
be
run
out
of
money
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
then
our
finance
director
and
i
have
have
to
go
to
the
bank
cap
in
hand
we
have
to
create
confidence
in
the
company
s
future
even
though
our
own
confidence
almost
ran
dry
at
time
the
company
be
small
and
in
bad
shape
if
money
and
confidence
have
run
out
the
nokia
story
would
have
end
there
and
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
then
when
finally
we
get
our
hand
on
some
money
we
start
to
worry
that
someone
would
buy
the
company
because
it
have
become
far
too
cheap
in
we
have
bumped
up
against
the
limit
of
our
own
growth
we
have
not
stock
up
in
advance
we
lose
control
of
the
company
over
the
course
of
eight
month
pekka
ala
pietil
and
pertti
korhonen
in
particular
manage
to
put
the
company
back
on
the
rail
if
we
have
fail
the
nokia
story
would
have
end
abruptly
it
be
only
on
account
of
the
crisis
that
we
learn
how
to
configure
a
global
company
for
sustainable
growth
in
we
be
the
big
company
in
our
own
field
we
have
reach
a
position
where
the
main
danger
be
arrogance
indifference
and
remote
ness
we
have
become
such
a
big
player
that
our
customer
and
our
business
partner
begin
to
see
us
as
a
threat
we
hadn
t
listen
closely
enough
to
the
telecom
operator
after
the
crisis
we
be
sharper
and
more
sensitive
and
travel
on
the
right
track
toward
the
next
round
of
change

against
all
odds
chapter
the
right
idea
some
wrong
assumption
and
prisoner
of
success
n
okia
have
be
accuse
in
retrospect
of
fail
to
understand
how
the
world
be
change
in
and
thereafter
i
simply
don
t
agree
we
knew
what
be
happen
where
we
fail
be
in
apply
our
knowl
edge
effectively
we
make
poor
decision
we
didn
t
think
thing
through
clearly
enough
and
we
didn
t
get
where
we
want
to
go
we
be
also
pris
oners
of
our
own
success
nokia
s
result
be
good
even
exceptional
once
we
be
clear
of
the
crisis
of
in
we
have
our
best
result
ever
none
of
us
would
have
imagine
that
just
a
year
or
two
later
the
company
would
produce
one
of
the
bad
result
in
its
history
it
all
begin
in
however
the
previous
year
we
have
plan
a
radi
cal
reorganization
intend
to
reflect
what
have
happen
in
the
market
for
mobile
phone
market
evolve
and
every
company
try
to
predict
the
di
rection
speed
and
intensity
of
change
we
believe
that
smartphones
be
on
their
way
we
believe
it
so
strongly
that
we
establish
a
new
business
unit
to
focus
on
them
and
we
pour
lot
of
money
into
product
develop
ment
and
marketing
the
purpose
of
the
reorganization
be
to
ensure
that
we
would
make
the
right
phone
for
new
market
nokia
s
mobile
phone
unit
nmp
have
grown
too
big
within
nokia
it
make
vast
number
of
mobile
phone
and
quantity
have
become
a
substitute
for
quality
logistics
procurement
and
sale
all
work
well
nmp
be
an
efficient
machine
but
the
efficient
machine
be
unable
to
make
the
new
product
that
nokia
sorely
need
if
production
be
direct
solely
at
satisfy
the
demand
that
already
exists
there
s
no
room
for
new
idea
furthermore
nokia
s
struc
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
tures
have
stayed
pretty
much
the
same
since
as
one
by
one
the
other
business
unit
cease
to
operate
only
two
be
left
nokia
mobile
phone
and
nokia
network
which
built
and
sell
network
to
operating
compa
ny
these
two
giant
be
like
company
within
the
company
and
their
manage
director
ran
them
in
the
style
of
ceo
we
need
a
new
organization
where
nmp
would
be
divide
into
three
the
mobile
phone
unit
the
multimedia
unit
and
enterprise
solution
nokia
have
tacitly
admit
that
smartphones
and
mid
range
phone
now
form
distinct
market
segment
also
in
the
new
matrix
structure
market
ing
wouldn
t
be
treat
as
a
single
function
it
would
be
integrate
verti
cally
with
the
new
business
unit
the
same
be
true
of
technology
which
be
perhaps
the
single
most
important
driver
of
activity
we
reconfigured
nokia
s
engineering
department
as
well
it
suit
some
of
the
engineer
but
others
found
the
new
structure
uncomfortable
in
fact
the
new
organization
be
unremarkable
this
be
how
major
compa
ny
be
and
be
organize
everywhere
and
in
all
area
of
business
matrix
organization
compel
people
from
different
unit
to
make
decision
together
and
to
take
notice
of
other
people
s
view
they
demand
the
maturity
to
understand
the
interest
of
the
whole
firm
which
be
not
the
same
as
the
profit
or
success
of
one
s
own
unit
they
also
compel
senior
management
to
be
where
the
action
be
because
there
be
always
issue
that
only
the
chief
executive
can
rule
on
lastly
matrix
organization
develop
friction
and
heat
which
be
essential
for
creativity
some
have
assume
that
nokia
s
later
difficulty
result
from
the
matrix
organization
introduce
in
i
don
t
agree
with
them
though
not
all
of
nokia
s
senior
manager
function
effectively
within
the
new
structure
perhaps
we
didn
t
train
people
enough
or
maybe
power
struggle
cause
problem
perhaps
i
too
be
unable
to
work
in
the
best
possible
way
in
the
new
organization
and
maybe
people
be
jostling
for
my
position
and
this
have
start
to
affect
their
behavior
i
think
now
that
the
reorganization
of
nokia
put
in
place
in
be
cor
rect
and
an
improvement
on
what
have
go
before
even
so
we
weren
t
huge
ly
successful
the
problem
be
perhaps
that
organization
be
make
of
people
in
one
strand
of
nokia
s
history
be
come
to
an
end
perceptive
people
sense
this
from
the
early
s
the
company
have
developed
a
par
ticular
culture
which
its
closely
knit
leader
sustain
for
many
year
i
be
of
course
one
of
those
leader
when
i
announce
that
i
be
step
down
the
situation
change
though
of
course
the
question
be
not
only
about
me
after
that
the
position
of
many
other
senior
manager
and
divisional
chief

against
all
odds
change
people
be
concerned
about
their
future
there
be
more
discus
sion
in
the
corridor
and
the
large
scale
reorganization
take
many
people
out
of
their
comfort
zone
all
of
nokia
s
most
important
people
have
put
a
great
deal
of
energy
into
the
company
over
decade
by

these
wonderful
people
have
shape
the
company
with
their
own
energy
and
after
their
own
character
within
the
company
they
be
living
legend
of
course
medium
exposure
success
and
their
fi
nancial
reward
all
have
something
to
do
with
this
the
five
and
some
other
senior
manager
be
more
than
just
salaried
staff
they
embody
the
com
pany
s
value
when
i
restructure
the
senior
leadership
at
nokia
for
the
last
time
in
i
may
not
have
give
enough
thought
to
the
significance
of
these
people
they
help
plan
the
new
organization
i
didn
t
foresee
a
future
in
which
they
wouldn
t
be
around
but
that
soon
become
the
reality
by
pekka
ala
pietil
matti
alahuhta
pertti
korhonen
and
sari
baldauf
have
all
left
nokia
my
role
change
too
when
i
move
to
be
chairman
of
the
board
of
director
and
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
take
over
as
chief
executive
the
change
in
senior
leadership
be
great
perhaps
we
lose
too
much
tacit
and
indeed
vocal
knowledge
at
the
time
of
the
restructuring
some
of
the
departure
be
agree
upon
well
in
advance
but
some
be
more
surpris
ing
either
way
the
result
be
that
only
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
anssi
vanjoki
and
i
remain
of
the
core
team
that
have
lead
nokia
from
the
mid
s
on
i
don
t
want
to
disparage
the
new
generation
of
leader
who
have
grown
up
at
nokia
who
try
to
step
into
their
shoe
in
the
restructure
company
but
the
break
with
the
past
be
perhaps
too
abrupt
many
employee
be
perhaps
too
ready
to
believe
that
the
good
time
would
continue
to
roll
and
that
both
they
and
the
company
would
continue
merrily
on
their
way
we
want
to
create
structure
that
weren
t
built
around
individual
man
agers
our
goal
be
the
world
s
best
organization
in
the
service
of
the
world
s
best
manufacturer
of
mobile
device
it
didn
t
occur
to
any
of
us
that
the
key
manager
would
depart
take
with
them
their
expertise
energy
idea
ex
perience
and
leadership
ability
perhaps
we
should
have
do
more
to
hang
on
to
at
least
some
of
them
i
certainly
make
other
mistake
the
new
structure
force
the
chief
execu
tive
to
be
more
intimately
involve
in
the
management
of
the
company
ever
small
issue
start
to
cross
my
desk
in
the
new
model
i
should
have
be
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
closer
to
the
machinery
but
psychologically
i
be
already
move
to
my
new
position
as
chairman
of
the
board
i
recognize
this
problem
and
do
ev
erything
i
could
but
as
so
often
happens
it
be
a
state
of
affair
that
i
need
a
twenty
fifth
hour
in
the
day
to
resolve
company
often
do
thing
either
too
early
or
too
late
nokia
restructure
itself
both
too
late
and
too
early
only
later
do
it
become
clear
that
we
have
invest
in
the
right
idea
but
too
soon
we
believe
that
the
market
want
expensive
high
performance
phone
but
we
be
wrong
it
be
only
later
that
the
operating
company
could
offer
the
service
that
make
smartphones
appeal
the
apple
iphone
come
on
the
market
only
in
the
nokia
n
the
new
structure
didn
t
mean
just
new
leader
ship
our
work
method
have
to
change
as
well
we
be
address
the
right
issue
but
even
so
our
result
remain
weak
we
be
try
to
do
the
thing
that
apple
google
and
microsoft
would
all
implement
later
the
old
nokia
have
make
many
basic
product
and
modify
them
when
necessary
whereas
we
want
to
focus
on
a
handful
of
software
platform
and
the
product
base
on
them
now
this
change
seem
self
evident
but
in
nokia
s
think
at
the
time
it
be
revolutionary
it
be
a
change
in
nokia
s
behavior
that
have
continued
to
this
day

to
move
to
wide
software
platform
phone
have
to
be
design
to
fit
the
software
not
the
software
to
fit
the
phone
this
be
a
crucial
change
and
we
want
our
restructuring
to
enable
us
to
move
forward
with
it
i
put
pertti

january
and
it

the
market
at
the
end
of

thus
begin
a
duel
between

its
challenger

to
design
manufacture
and
market
our

chapter
could
nokia
have
be
a
software
company
w
hen
a
company
run
into
difficulty
they
always
seem
new
and
unpredictable
in
fact
they
will
have
be
around
for
a
while
in
the
form
of
unanswered
question
careless
think
or
half
bake
decision
every
company
try
to
evade
difficult
issue
and
it
s
the
leader
s
job
to
spot
them
in
time
and
try
to
find
the
right
solution
before
they
become
too
big
solve
them
on
paper
isn
t
enough
you
have
to
find
a
way
of
put
your
decision
and
solution
into
effect
company
have
to
change
and
sometimes
extremely
fast
as
with
a
sail
ing
boat
tack
to
windward
the
turn
have
to
be
extremely
smooth
fast
control
and
decisive
otherwise
the
craft
will
capsize
you
can
only
turn
rapidly
if
you
re
sure
of
your
direction
uncertainty
and
difference
of

will
slow
down
the
decision
the
boat
may
already
have
wash
up
on
the
rock
because
the
turn
should
have
be
make
much
earlier
we
try
to
change
at
nokia
between
and
we
want
to
change
direction
but
didn
t
know
what
in
practice
that
meant
at
the
same
time
we
be
all
and
i
mean
everyone
at
nokia
prisoner
of
our
own
past
we
have
long
see
that
nokia
be
shift
from
manufacturing
to
service
provision
which
demand
great
expertise
in
software
design
we
knew
that
nokia
have
to
become
a
software
company
we
talk
about
this
inter
nally
and
to
the
medium
we
also
announce
long
before
our
competitor
that
the
internet
would
soon
fit
in
people
s
pocket
and
so
it
do
though
much
later
than
we
have
forecast
nokia
never
have
its
own
operating
system
or
a
unit
within
the
company
that
might
produce
one
nokia
have
establish
itself
as
a
developer
of
tele

against
all
odds
phone
equipment
we
have
acquire
the
template
for
an
operating
system
by
take
over
a
small
company
that
have
by
chance
come
up
for
sale
in
the
company
be
base
in
england
and
its
name
be
symbian
it
be
bought
jointly
by
nokia
ericsson
and
motorola
symbian
have
begin
as
a
company
call
psion
which
have
make
little
palmtop
computer
one
of
its
most
successful
product
be
the
psion
or
ganizer
which
have
a
database
and
a
diary
psion
continued
to
operate
after
it
have
sell
its
software
expertise
along
with
symbian
to
the
mobile
phone
company
motorola
take
over
what
be
left
of
the
original
company
in

phone
be
no
longer
just
phone
by
the
begin
of
the
s
they
be
smart
high
performance
device
with
numerous
application
they
have
become
computer
the
phone
that
offer
the
best
experience
to
its
user
would
be
the
victor
and
the
operating
system
be
the
very
heart
of
the
battle
anssi
vanjoki
and
pertti
korhonen
disagreed
about
many
thing
but
about
this
they
be
of
one
mind
they
both
believe
that
symbian
software
would
give
us
a
competitive
edge
if
we
could
use
it
as
a
base
to
which
we
could
add
application
if
we
could
create
a
smartphone
in
this
way
it
would
be
a
roar
sale
success
central
to
our
think
be
a
conviction
that
our
more
expensive
smartphones
would
eventually
use
a
linux
base
operating
system
which
at
some
point
would
replace
symbian
this
line
of
thought
eventually
give
rise
to
the
meego
operating
system
naturally
there
be
one
question
that
make
us
pause
be
symbian
still
a
competitive
option
in
the
new
world
we
have
a
brisk
internal
debate
on
this
issue
from
to
at
nokia
it
be
our
long
stand
practice
for
each
model
of
phone
to
have
its
own
version
of
the
operating
system
now
we
try
to
change
thing
so
that
a
single
software
platform
would
support
a
common
operating
sys
tem
for
many
different
model
the
basic
idea
be
clear
and
simple
but
it
demand
a
major
cultural
shift
inside
the
company
this
be
anything
but
easy
the
mobile
phone
mentality
have
to
move
to
the
smartphone
era
i
really
wasn
t
an
expert
on
software
so
i
have
to
rely
on
my
key
adviser
pertti
korhonen
and
anssi
vanjoki
pertti
knew
more
than
anyone
at
nokia
what
our
product
be
make
of
and
how
they
work
but
pertti
wasn
t
a
child
of
the
new
software
age
his
experience
come
chiefly
from
the
s
and
the
begin
of
the
s
still
he
be
the
one
who
knew
most
about
software
in
our
senior
management
team
anssi
have
a
comprehensive
un
derstanding
of
our
product
and
the
demand
that
user
make
of
them
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
once
again
look
back
it
s
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event
none
of
us
anssi
vanjoki
pertti
korhonen
or
me
be
software
expert
nor
be
matti
alahuhta
or
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
we
could
ask
penetrate
ques
tions
but
to
answer
them
we
depend
on
the
expertise
of
the
next
level
down
in
the
organization
what
would
happen
in
the
software
world
in
the
next
five
to
ten
year
how
could
nokia
best
turn
itself
into
a
software
com
pany
and
if
it
could
what
would
be
the
consequence
what
should
we
do
we
feverishly
sought
good
evidence
base
answer
to
these
question
in
nokia
really
need
its
own
home
grown
software
expert
with
a
deep
knowledge
of
the
field
to
tackle
these
burning
issue
but
we
didn
t
have
them
indeed
there
didn
t
seem
to
be
such
people
anywhere
in
europe
as
far
back
as
we
have
talk
of
strengthen
our
software
expertise
and
we
have
begin
to
get
a
grip
on
the
problem
first
we
apply
the
lesson
of
some
positive
experience
from
the
s
we
have
boost
product
development
in
both
mobile
phone
and
network
by
bring
in
finland
s
lead
expert
in
radio
technology
we
have
work
closely
with
the
university
on
that
the
best
example
be
yrj
neuvo
who
join
us
in
and
become
the
chief
technology
officer
as
the
world
s
lead
researcher
on
digital
signal
processing
his
fingerprint
be
all
over
nokia
s
technological
lead
the
result
be
exceptional
truly
world
class
we
try
to
repeat
this
in
software
nokia
take
on
a
large
group
of
profes
sors
and
key
researcher
from
the
university
and
polytechnic
they
spent
a
year
or
two
either
at
nokia
s
research
centre
or
in
individual
business
unit
but
the
second
time
around
the
result
be
modest
downright
feeble
when
around
we
really
start
to
understand
what
we
be
up
against
we
try
to
recruit
more
experienced
software
expert
we
also
strengthen
the
research
centre
and
our
product
development
work
in
the
united
state
both
in
boston
and
in
silicon
valley
again
the
result
turn
out
to
be
very
weak
use
these
method
it
simply
wasn
t
possible
to
develop
a
strong
team
of
software
expert
in
a
short
time
symbian
be
nokia
s
smartphone
operating
system
until
when
the
company
announce
it
be
move
to
the
microsoft
operating
system

against
all
odds
pa
r
t
v
what
s
a
chief
executive
for
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa

against
all
odds
chapter
the
january
decision
i
have
make
many
major
decision
just
after
christmas
i
usually
take
a
break
then
until
the
second
week
of
january
when
i
return
to
my
office
on
the
seventh
floor
of
nokia
s
headquarters
in
january
i
knew
i
wouldn
t
continue
as
the
company
s
chief
executive
much
longer
ac
tually
i
have
know
that
for
some
time
but
i
hadn
t
let
anyone
know
now
it
be
time
to
leave
and
to
choose
a
successor
i
be
relieve
but
i
knew
the
process
wouldn
t
be
easy
i
have
want
to
relinquish
the
ceo
responsibility
earlier
as
well
i
have
thought
of
leave
in
but
it
would
have
look
as
if
i
be
flee
from
the
difficulty
that
be
then
just
start
the
company
s
board
of
director
appeal
to
me
to
stay
on
i
have
an
agreement
whereby
i
could
leave
the
company
in
if
i
wish
though
i
be
commit
to
stay
at
least
until
then
not
everyone
have
take
the
agreement
seriously
but
for
me
it
be
im
portant
it
seem
to
me
that
i
have
do
everything
i
could
do
as
the
ceo
of
nokia
and
from
now
on
i
really
didn
t
have
anything
more
to
add
also
i
felt
that
nokia
need
some
clear
change
there
should
be
opportunity
for
new
people
the
executive
committee
need
to
be
more
international
and
i
want
to
do
something
different
in
january
i
still
didn
t
have
any
idea
what
that
something
might
be
when
i
be
chosen
to
become
nokia
s
chief
executive
the
company
s
owner
at
the
time
finnish
bank
and
insurance
company
invite
me
to
a
dimly
lit
conference
room
and
ask
me
to
take
on
the
role
that
be
how
finnish
company
still
do
thing
in
the
early
s
they
didn
t
interview
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
other
candidate
or
even
consider
them
nor
do
anyone
ask
whether
the
new
ceo
should
come
from
inside
or
outside
the
company
some
finn
want
nokia
s
ceo
to
be
select
the
same
way
even
now
i
couldn
t
have
disagreed
more
i
want
the
alternative
to
be
examine
closely
i
want
the
candidate
interviewed
i
want
to
explore
the
option
of
an
external
candidate
even
though
i
thought
there
be
many
brilliant
candidate
for
the
job
within
nokia
when
nokia
s
new
leadership
structure
begin
to
operate
at
the
begin
of
many
people
saw
it
as
the
first
stage
in
the
competition
for
the
new
ceo
but
the
organization
hadn
t
be
transform
in
order
for
potential
candidate
to
compete
although
the
new
organization
certainly
give
them
a
chance
to
demonstrate
their
competence
motivation
and
ability
to
work
with
others
pekka
ala
pietil
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
and
pertti
korhonen
be
the
key
candidate
matti
alahuhta
after
become
strategy
director
left
the
company
in
the
autumn
of
and
sari
baldauf
have
also
decide
to
leave
at
the
end
of
so
they
be
no
longer
in
the
run
i
discuss
the
selection
of
the
new
ceo
with
deputy
chairman
paul
collins
since
he
be
prepare
personnel
matter
for
consideration
by
the
board
he
be
fully
abreast
of
modern
governance
procedure
and
told
me
bluntly
at
the
outset

whether
our
internal
candidate
would
satisfy
international
requirement

enough

to
consider
external
candidate

work

set
up
by
the
board
bore
the
main
responsibility

and
per
karlsson
with
bengt
homstr

an
additional

interviewed
and
i
don
t
know
how
well
each
of

page
on

their
strength
and
the
area
where
they
need
ed
development
the
only
genuine
surprise
in
the
whole
process
come
on
saturday
march
pekka
ala
pietil
told
me
that
he
didn
t
want
to
be
the
ceo
he
have
thought
about
it
and
talk
it
through
with
his
family
and
decide
that
he
didn
t
have
the
necessary
fire
for
the
job
he
would
leave
nokia
later
that
year
pekka
s
announcement
make
the
selection
process
more
difficult
he
have
be
appoint
deputy
chief
executive
in
and
a
year
later
he
have
be
come
president
when
i
be
appoint
chairman
after
which
he
have
be
a
clear
candidate
to
be
my
successor
i
have
told
the
board
back
in
that
i
want
to
step
down
as
ceo
in
and
that
i
saw
pekka
as
my
successor
when
the
board
didn
t
go
along
with
my
proposal
i
agree
to
extend
my
term
until
pekka
be
visibly
young
than
me
we
have
work
together
for
many
year
i
value
his
bril
liant
grasp
of
strategy
and
his
ability
to
lead
people
within
an
organization
i
be
disappointed
and
sad
at
his
decision
and
i
couldn
t
help
think
that
pekka
should
have
see
it
as
his
duty
to
pursue
the
ceo
role
on
the
other
hand
i
respect
his
decision
and
his
decisiveness
he
didn
t
want
to
be
in
the
public
eye
as
a
medium
target
but
as
ceo
of
nokia
you
can
t
avoid
that
it
s
one
of
the
less
agreeable
feature
of
the
job
after
pekka
withdrew
the
process
need
speed
up
if
pekka
have
in
principle
decide
to
leave
nokia
we
have
to
move
up
a
gear
to
appoint
a
new
ceo
at
the
board
meeting
in
july
if
we
do
that
we
wouldn
t
lose
time
or
cause
uncertainty
within
the
organization
the
board
met
in
london
on
july
the
most
important
item
on
the
agenda
be
the
appointment
have
deliberate
the
matter
the
work
group
have
whittle
the
list
down
to
two
candidate
and
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
be
the
strong
the
board
want
a
chance
to
explore
whether
nokia
should
be
lead
by
a
young
man
i
too
have
say
this
option
should
be
examine
closely
as
the
meeting
go
on
i
debate
with
paul
collins
whether
nokia
should
go
for
experience
or
for
youthful
promise
the
board
clearly
tend
toward
experience
and
i
really
have
no
objection
to
raise
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
would
be
my
successor
as
the
ceo
of
nokia
he
be
on
hand
if
the
board
want
to
talk
to
him
but
no
far
interview
be
need
the
board
knew
him
well
enough
and
the
work
group
have
give
him
a
thorough
grill
already
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
nokia
have
appoint
a
new
ceo
who
would
assume
his
duty
in
june
responsibility
for
this
decision
be
in
part
mine
though
i
have
not
participate
at
all
in
the
official
selection
process
we
also
discuss
my
own
role
i
d
announce
that
i
want
to
do
something
new
in
a
distinctly
dif
ferent
field
paul
collins
told
me
that
the
board
want
me
to
continue
as
their
chairman
even
though
it
be
extremely
important
to
give
olli
pekka
the
space
he
need
to
build
his
own
management
team
organization
and
to
develop
his
own
plan
and
strategy
i
wasn
t
keen
on
stay
on
as
chairman
after
some
persuasion
i
agree
to
it
but
only
after
my
role
have
be
clearly
define
for
the
benefit
of
the
medium
investor
and
nokia
itself
we
agree
that
my
role
as
chairman
would
be
the
same
as
casimir
ehrnrooth
s
in
the
nokia
of
the
s
i
would
spend
one
or

would
focus
on

proud
of
my
company
which
have
nurture
people
who
could
continue
my
work
i
felt
we
have
reach
the
right
decision
even
if
there
have
be
some
surprise
along
the
way
i
be
also
satisfied
that
everything
have
be
do
thoroughly
and
by
the
book
as
well
as
the
interview
we
have
commission
comprehensive
external
analysis
of
the
candidate

and
weakness
we
have
gotten
to
know
them
inside
out

one
have
a
right
to
just
walk
into
one
of
the
most
difficult
but
fascinate
job
the
business
world
could
offer
at
the
begin
of
august
the
world
s
medium
be
told
who
would
take
over
from

s
appointment
as
a
member
of

although
i
would
be
responsible
for
the
company
as
ceo
until

i
want
to
give
olli
pekka
full
responsibility
for
the
planning
process
for
on
august
pekka
olli
pekka
and
i
sat
at
the
front
of
the
auditorium
at
our
head
office
to
give
a
press
conference
there
be
a
slight
air
of
sadness
in
the
room
a
sense
that
an
era
be
draw
to
a
close
and
a
new
one
be
begin
pekka
spoke
honestly
about
the
reason
for
his
own
decision
he
want
to
do
something
new
after
all
the
year
he
have
spent
at
nokia
he
explain
that
he
didn
t
really
have
the
fire
in
his
belly
to
take
over
the
role
of
ceo
olli
pekka
for
his
part
be
certain
that
he
do
have
what
it
would
take
to
lead
nokia
into
its
next
phase

against
all
odds
with
these
men
these
two
men
who
be
so
close
to
me
i
have
fought
for
nokia
fifteen
year
before
they
both
belong
to
the
elite
of
the
world
s
business
leader
and
it
be
good
to
sit
between
them
for
me
it
be
time
to
do
something
else
our
press
conference
be
open
and
honest
i
suppose
the
foreign
journal
ists
suspect
that
some
complex
plot
be
go
on
behind
the
scene
no
one
could
have
spoken
more
openly
of
their
motif
than
pekka
and
olli
pekka
the
journalist
seem
to
believe
them
since
neither
of
them
have
any
other
agenda
all
three
of
us
say
what
we
thought
and
how
we
have
reach
our
decision

give
my
preliminary
agreement

confirm
this
in
the
summer
when
i
saw
that

would
reach
a
quick
decision
on
my

over
joyed

with

run
out
of

during
the

beaten
off
our

especially

to
show
some

truly
a
challenge
for
him
the
market
have
give
us
clear
indication
that
the
american
company
lu
cent
might
be
for
sale
we
take
a
closer
look
and
when
our
hunch
be
con
firm
we
approach
the
company
lucent
have
be
split
off
from
at
t
as
an
independent
enterprise
as
a
list
company
it
have
become
a
favorite

against
all
odds
with
investor
in
the
s
it
have
a
voracious
appetite
and
grow
through
acquisition
into
a
global
enterprise
but
at
the
begin
of
the
s
lucent
found
itself
in
difficulty
and
be
force
to
divest
some
of
its
non
core
busi
ness
negotiation
begin
in
the
early
spring
of
i
met
lucent
s
chairwom
an
patricia
russo
whom
i
already
knew
slightly
russo
have
long
experience
in
the
it
field
and
have
lead
lucent
since
she
be
regard
as
one
of
america
s
most
influential
woman
executive
later
the
negotiation
be
conduct
between
the
business
leader
and
finance
staff
and
we
get
a
good
idea
of
where
lucent
be
come
from
and
what
sort
of
company
it
be
i
didn
t
make
any
major
acquisition
when
i
be
the
nokia
ceo
we
have
grown
organically
for
the
most
part
and
i
be
cautious
about
acquisition
their
success
rate
isn
t
very
high
too
often
they
re
pursue
for
the
wrong
reason
to
expand
ego
and
empire
too
often
executive
underestimate
the
energy
need
to
acquire
and
absorb
a
company
and
successfully
merge
two
company
culture
economic
history
be
full
of
sad
tale
of
unsuccessful
acquisition
which
on
occasion
have
sunk
the
company
make
the
pur
chase
perhaps
my
subconscious
caution
be
due
also
to
nokia
s
little
ban
quet
of
acquisition
in
the
s
i
have
spent
a
long
time
cleaning
up
the
consequence
our
position
now
be
perhaps
a
little
more
complicate
than
that
lucent
s
shareholder
have
conclude
that
the
company
couldn
t
survive
on
its
own
if
nokia
didn
t
buy
it
one
of
our
competitor
would
we
knew
lucent
be
also
in
negotiation
with
two
other
company
one
be
the
french
company
alcatel
the
other
be
probably
motorola
or
ericsson
but
we
weren
t
sure
while
i
be
ponder
whether
to
buy
lucent
i
be
also
consider
the
future
of
nokia
s
network
business
the
american
who
be
commendably
clear
cut
in
everything
always
thought
that
if
they
couldn
t
buy
they
could
at
least
sell
and
at
a
good
price
business
there
be
a
constant
round
of
deal
and
trade
where
the
shop
be
always
open
in
europe
thing
be
a
little
different
siemens
for
example
have
rarely
sell
any
of
its
business
should
nokia
have
sell
its
network
business
absolutely
if
you
ask
a
stock
exchange
analyst
in
the
spring
of
it
would
have
freed
up
some
cash
and
make
the
area
more
dynamic
and
of
course
it
would
have
left
nokia
as
a
mobile
phone
company
pure
and
simple
in
practice
the
only
possible
buyer
would
have
be
siemens
and
i
for
one
would
have
be
emotionally
allergic
to
that
lucent
want
a
quick
answer
however
our
first
impression
be
that
the
company
s
fix
cost
be
far
too
high
and
that
it
be
too
well
staffed
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
it
have
employee
and
its
revenue
be
billion
the
more
closely
we
look
at
the
company
the
more
strongly
our
impression
be
confirm
on
the
plus
side
the
company
s
market
share
in
the
united
state
be
grow
ing
but
the
negative
factor
become
clearer
too
lucent
need
a
complete
restructuring
with
its
unprofitable
unit
in
various
part
of
the
world
shut
down
there
be
question
about
many
liability
on
the
company
s
balance
sheet
which
be
not
uncommon
after
painstaking
deliberation
we
decide
that
buying
lucent
wouldn
t
be
a
smart
move
for
nokia
or
for
its
shareholder
the
board
make
this
decision
before
easter
and
we
knew
we
be
set
in
motion
a
series
of
change
in
the
market
for
network
we
have
make
the
opening
move
and
other
move
would
necessarily
follow
lucent
announce
at
the
start
of
april
that
it
would
merge
with
alcatel
which
be
one
and
a
half
time
big
time
show
clearly
that
alcatel
didn
t
get
the
benefit
from
the
deal
that
it
have
expect
the
hop
for
opportunity
for
cooperation
didn
t
mate
rialize
as
be
so
often
the
case
alcatel
have
to
write
down
much
of
the
value
of
lucent
which
show
that
the
deal
have
waste
the
shareholder
money
which
be
now
available
for
the
seller
lucent
s
shareholder
to
enjoy
another
common
story
after
all
this
we
have
no
reason
to
mourn
our
decision
on
lucent
we
knew
that
it
be
time
for
us
to
plan
our
next
move
thus
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
we
begin
to
negotiate
with
siemens
which
for
nokia
be
a
familiar
story
back
in
the
s
nokia
s
prowess
in
sell
to
the
soviet
union
have
arouse
the
interest
of
siemens
in
west
germany
in
its
ceo
anton
hasholzner
propose
that
we
undertake
joint
project
in
telephone
tech
nology
but
the
talk
didn
t
reach
a
conclusion
early
in
the
s
siemens
approach
nokia
again
want
to
buy
our
network
business
at
that
time
we
decide
to
turn
down
the
offer
now
we
be
discuss
new
form
of
cooperation
in
other
word
a
joint
enterprise
siemens
have
other
joint
venture
such
as
the
computer
company
fujitsu
siemens
or
bosch
and
sie
men
hausgerate
which
make
white
good
but
such
cooperation
be
a
de
parture
from
our
normal
way
of
do
business
negotiation
go
ahead
on
two
level
i
discuss
the
concept
and
broad
direction

discuss
the
operational
side
with
his
german
counterpart
during
the
spring
and
summer
we
developed
an
excellent
mutual
understand
on
most
issue
but
we
couldn
t
agree
on
one
key
principle
how
be
the
company
to
be
lead
siemens
drew
on
its
pre
vious
experience
in
cooperative
venture
and
stress
that
the
firm
should

against
all
odds
be
run
so
that
both
parent
company
have
equivalent
power
and
responsi
bility
we
didn
t
agree
we
warn
that
this
model
would
lead
to
two
head
office
uncertainty
over
who
be
in

there
would

in

during
the
call
we
decide
that
we
couldn
t
accept
the
model
siemens
propose
there
would
be
no
agreement
unless
nokia
take
charge
of
the
nascent
joint
enterprise
in
the
spring
we
discuss
practical
issue
and
siemens
finally
come
around
to
our
way
of
think
on

by

and
these

into
a
little
book
every
message
be
truly
heartwarming
in
my
last
day
as
chairman
there
be
however
a
sad
undertone
because
our
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
colleague
on
the
board
douard
michelin
have
die

how
i
ve
already
explain
that
nokia
s
culture
have
no
room
for
elaborate
ceremony
and
at
my
own
wish
we
make
no
exception
for
me
at
o
clock
olli

if

i
have
others

talk
of

and
com

the

it
s
all
too
easy
to

discussion
with
the
external
world
isn
t
enough
on

you
have
to
have
people
inside
the
company
who
will
be
honest
with
you
that
s
why
a
company
need
an
open
supportive
culture
with
the
right
process
un
derpinning
it
such

on
the
chief
executive
s
behalf
consultant
and
investment
bank
er
be
important
adviser
but
one
must
take
rigorous
care
that
the
desire
and
ability
to
make
decision
be
kept
strictly
within
one

i
try
to
stay

where
the

seem
at
risk
of

the
only
people
worth

some
senior

seem
to
have
a
bewilderingly
rickety
base
they
didn

understand
how

that

that
they
should

time
and
we
try
to
do
our
groundwork
i
have
learn
the
most
important
lesson
on
my
first
visit
to
china
in
you
have
to
get
to
know
the
country
inside
out
if
a
company
want
to
know
what
be
happen
in
the
market
there
the
chief
executive
have
to
meet
politician
official
and
the
manager
of
chinese
company
that
be
the
only
way
to
make
the
contact
every
company
need
only
by
talk
to
chinese
people
could
you
get
solid
information
about
the
country
s
politics
and
economics
for
me
china
be
always
a
vivid
experience
i
saw
firsthand
how
the
world
s
new
economic
locomotive
be
gathering
power
and
how
chinese
decision
maker
saw
the
world
and
put
their
own
idea
into
action
the
traffic
be
not
one
way
the
chinese
be
very
interested
in
nokia
in
the
s
i
remember
very
well
how
they
paid
their
first
state
visit
to
nokia
on
april
deputy
prime
minister
wu
bangguo
land
at
helsinki
airport
after
have
wangle
himself
an
invitation
to
finland
his
team
wish
to
spend
two
day
with
nokia
in
espoo
near
helsinki
and
at
oulu
in
the
north
the
chinese
want
to
find
out
whether
the
company
would
be
a
partner
with
adequate
resource
for
china
in
its
expand
gsm
project
i
remember
the
meeting
especially
well
because
my
mother
have
die
the
day
before
the
chinese
guest
of
honor
give
the
matter
due
atten
tion
in
his
elegant
comment
since
mother
be
greatly
respect
in
chinese
culture
we
become
good
friend
of
the
deputy
prime
minister
later
on
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
on
my
trip
to
china
i
also
try
to
meet
people
outside
of
business
and
look
around
a
lot
visit
to
regional
city
often
give
a
clearer
picture
of
what
the
future
hold

i
share
my
interest
in
china
with
sari

she
built
up
our
network
operation
and
become
a
world
class
expert
on
do
business
with
china
we
often
held
long
discussion
of
how
nokia
could
best
succeed
there
i
travel
to
china
three
or
four
time
a
year
sari
even
more
often
together
we
establish
a
unique
network
of
decision
maker
entrepre
neurs
and
other
people
and
through
our
chinese
manager
and
employee
we
learn
about
the
country
s
political
and
social
climate
on
a
visit
to
china
in
i
listen
to
a
young
and
gift
chinese
wom
an
who
have
just
start
work
at
nokia
she
could
have
gotten
a
job
at
any
international
company
on
the
basis
of
her
top
class
education
but
she
have
chosen
nokia
on
the
ground
that
there
she
could
one
day
become
chief
ex
ecutive
when
i
heard
that
i
smile
to
myself
her
remark
rang
true
nokia
appeal
to
talented
chinese
because
it
be
so
much
less
concerned
with
bureaucracy
or
the
peck
order
than
even
american
firm
promotion
could
be
much
quicker
at
nokia
and
the
company
felt
informal
as
a
country
china
be
not
in
the
least
informal
on
my
own
visit
i
often
receive
a
reception
tantamount
to
what
a
head
of
state
might
expect
on
a
state
visit
a
police
escort
would
conduct
the
procession
of

along
the
street

always

in
we
receive
a
timely
reminder
of
our
mortality
nokia

three
office

found
ourselves
off

when
chi
nese

begin
opening
up
the
distribution
network
for

we
rapidly
found
a
new
way
of
sell

in
a
few
year
we
have
seventy
distributor
and
soon
we
have
a
presence
in
every
one
of
china

most
important
regional
city
we
also
start

well

to
the
chinese
market
and
allow
the
use
of
chinese
char

the

quickly
understood
that

alone
wouldn

this

so
the

they
wouldn

in

it
turn
out
that

peaked
around

but
the

also
grow

it
be
too
easy
for
the

to
assume
nokia
would
remain
in
a
strong
position
because
the
figure
be
all
good
and
still
trend
upwards
this
be
deceptive
though
because
the

look
back
it
s
easy
to
accuse
nokia
of
complacency
we
knew
how
to
make
mobile
phone
and
some
people
at
nokia
undoubt
edly
believe
that
apple
could
never
overtake
our
market
share
or
even
make
a
mobile
that
work
properly
teethe
trouble
with
the
iphone
such
as
its
malfunction
antenna
tend
to
confirm
that
view
nokia
s
long
experience
in
manufacturing
mobile
phone
enable
it
to
minimize
such
problem
back
in
i
want
to
be
confident
that
the
new
executive
committee
wouldn
t
be
blind
by
its
own
excellence
and
i
want
to
learn
thing
for
myself
there
be
so
much
go
on
technical
advance
new
trend
in
design
and
a
rapid
evolution
in
the
way
customer
use
their
phone
they
be
all
happen
at
an
exhaust
rate
and
all
have
an
impact
in
the
contest
for
dominance
in
the
global
mobile
phone
market
i
have
no
idea
how
many
model
i
must
have
try
out
during
my
time
as

with
the
turmoil
the
advent
of
the

cause
nokia
as
autumn
approach
i
decide
to
undertake
a
little
survey
of
nokia
s
senior
people
i
chat
with
a
dozen
of
them
ask
if
they
saw
the
iphone
as
a
dangerous
competitor
of
the
dozen
two
thought
the
iphone
pose
no
danger
because
our
symbian
operating
system
be
well
than
apple
s
io
the
other
ten
thought
the
iphone
would
prove
a
serious
competitor
that
we

against
all
odds
shouldn
t
underestimate
some
of
them
express
their
view
in
term
not
fit
for
publication
the
message
be
clear
most
of
nokia
s
key
people
be
alert
enough
to
grasp
that
apple
really
have
thrown
down
the
gauntlet
in
the
contest
for
the
smartphone
market
book
have
already
be
write
about
the
success
of
the
iphone
and
doubtless
there
be
more
to
come
its
touchscreen
be
a
triumph
and
its
over
all
design
be
unique
functional
and
simple
the
iphone
show
once
and
for
all
that
the
most
important
thing
isn
t
the
engineering
the
material
or
even
a
phone
s
battery
which
iphone
user
can
t
change
for
themselves
no
the
most
important
thing
be
the
apps
the
program
and
service
that
iphone
user
can
buy
for
their
phone
these
comprise
the
user
experience
that
make
one
phone
special
and
another
ordinary
an
entire
ecosystem
have
come
into
be
of
a
sort
that
nokia
have
be
unable
to
create
itself
club
nokia
have
perhaps
be
a
gesture
in
the
right
direction
but
that
be
as
far
as
we
have
go
if
you
bought
an
iphone
you
be
buying
not
just
a
phone
but
a
passport
to
an
ever
grow
and
rapidly
evolve
world
the
phone
give
you
entry
to
a
digital
community
and
the
phone
work
beautifully
with
other
apple
product
the
iphone
offer
something
nokia
couldn
t
even
so
in
retro
spect
it
s
good
to
recall
that
the
iphone
be
far
from
an
instant
success
it
sell
slowly
when
it
be
first
release
in
by
the
spring
of
though
every
smart
person
knew
it
be
go
to
be
really
something
we
at
nokia
saw
what
be
happen
then
why
didn
t
we
do
something
about
it
there
be
many
answer
to
that
question
at
nokia
we
use
to
say
that
a
new
manager
be
stuck
with
their
predecessor
for
the
first
eighteen
month
what
this
really
meant
be
that
the
new
manager
be
stuck
with
the
product
their
predecessor
have
launch
on
the
other
hand
nokia
s
success
never
depend
on
a
single
product
but
always
on
a
range
of
prod
ucts
my
own
influence
on
nokia
s
product
range
continued
into
though
i
have
step
down
as
chief
executive
the
previous
june
thing
be
still
go
well
back
then
because
we
make
the
best
possible
symbian
phone
the
n
everything
seem
to
be
under
control
at
nokia
and
we
weren
t
aware
of
any
threat
nokia
have
chosen
symbian
as
the
operating
system
for
its
smartphone
much
earlier
symbian
too
be
in
the
throe
of
change
nokia
own
just
percent
of
symbian
share
and
the
other
owner
hadn
t
so
far
allow
us
to
acquire
a
majority
so
nokia
be
to
a
certain
degree
a
prisoner
of
symbian
s
other
shareholder
but
their
interest
have
dwindle
so
nokia
finally
suc
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
ceeded
in
take
over
the
business
in
its
entirety
nokia
decide
to
make

a
free
provider
of
source

thus
the
symbian
foundation
come
into
be
nokia
and
the
other
owner
move
their
operating
system
to
the
new
symbian
so
that
open
source
code
would
stimulate
innovation
in
software
and
service
the
open
symbian
begin
its
work
in
spring
it
didn
t
publish
all
its
software
because
various
agreement
prevent
that
even
so
the
release
of
code
in

the

bochum

ten
year
earlier
nokia

close
a

a
german

the

agree
that
the

be
no
longer
competitive
it
be
in
the
wrong
place
and
need
a
level
of
investment
we
weren

because
we
have
just
make
a
major
investment
in
romania
in

to

but
we
could
all
see
far
enough
ahead
to
know
that
the
announcement
be
likely
to
play
badly
in

be
of
one
mind
about
all
this
in
the
autumn
of
we
knew
on
the
basis
of
our
previous
experience
that
the
closure
of
a
factory
in
germany
would
provoke
a
sharp
reaction
we
knew
germany

powerful
trade

movement
would
want
to
flex
its

everything
have
to

very
well
and
very
thoroughly
we
have
to

care

so
that
the

wouldn

damage

can

afford
a

mistake
if

we
go
through
the
plan
for
bochum
at
the

board
meeting
we
emphasize
the
need
to
manage

with
the

very
carefully
it
would
make

well
in

a

adviser
have
told
them
there
be
no
point

they
would
only
try

string

out

the

that

it
would

an

to
apologize
for
them
but
without
much
success
from
the
board
s
point
of
view
it
be
disconcert
that
the
closure
at
bochum
have
be
handle
almost
entirely
contrary
to
nokia
s
culture
and
practice
so
care
fully
nurture
over
fifteen
year
this
left
its
mark
when
nokia
reduce
its

in

an
exceptionally
close
watch
the

have
see
thing
through

the

left
a

dent
in

at

the

be
dissatisfied
with
the
strategy
present
by
the
leadership
team
the

s
view
be
that
nokia
have
no
real
answer
to
apple
whose
breakthrough
in
the
market
for

be
now
absolutely
clear
a

of

have
expect
to
stay
loyal
to

queue
through
the

there
seem
to
be
too
many
gap
and

in
nokia

strategy
it
have
far
too
few
clear
goal
or
suggestion
for
concrete
activity
which
the
board
found
unsettle
it
be
agree
that
the
draft

would
be
the
basis
for

earlier
that
i
would
devote
one

didn
t
spend
his

it
be
for
olli

olli

be
the
first
to
admit

at

in

any

what
they

the
ability
to
find
the

people
for

nokia
be
unable
to
find
the
people
who
could
have
transform
it
into
a
software
company
it
be
stagnant
and
feeble
on
account
of
its
reliance
on
symbian
the
board
believe
that
the
company
have
enough
software
ex
pertise
and
senior
management
assure
them
there
be
no
problem
with
basic
competence
and
that
the
problem
with

would
be
solve
the
warn
signal
become
serious
in
the
summer
and
autumn
of
i
have
experienced
a
number
of
summer
when
worry
have
start
to
mount
up
it
felt
bad
the

be
in

before
the
mind
or
the
jorma

so
it
be
in
i
felt
a
sense
of
powerlessness
and
physical
pain
for
at
least
a
year
ahead
it
would
be
a
difficult
time
perhaps
the
most
difficult
nokia
have
go
through
a
crayfish
party
in

be
the

be
go
the
way
the

want
them
to
go
toward
the
end
of
the

the

in
a
broad
sense
with
the
member
of

the
committee
be
nearly
unanimous
on
this
though
one
member
a
finn
found
the
decision
hasty
and
surprising
i
held
my
discussion
between
february
and
april
with
olli
pekka
s
knowledge
and
consent
each
conversation

between
half
an
hour
and
ninety
minute
i
spread
the
discussion
over
a
long
period
because
i
didn
t
wish
to
give
the
impression
that
we
be
in
a
crisis
demand
rapid
resolu

i
try
to
find
out
where
the
pressure
point
lay
and
how
they
affected
the
company
s
effectiveness
i
conclude
each
conversation
with
a
question
be
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
the
right
person
to
lead
nokia
these
conversation
weren
t
easy
however
i
knew
everyone
i
be
talk
to
they
all
chose
their
word
carefully
and
they
all
want
to
give
serious
answer
to
the
chairman
s
question
there
be
a
dozen
interview
in
all
most
take
place
in
meeting
room
at
the
head
office
and
one
during
a
visit
to
london
about
half
of
those
i
consult
support
olli
pekka
without
reservation
but
a
similar
proportion
be
so
skeptical
of
his
prospect
as
to
stretch
the
limit
of
polite
speech
olli
pekka
be
a
sympathetic
individual
and
doesn
t
arouse
antipathy
but
the
doubt
about
him
be
clear
and
strong
enough
to
act
upon
these
discussion
with
board
member
didn
t
seal
the
chief
execu

s
fate
on
their
own
but
they
provide
important
support
material
at
the
begin
of
may
the
board
be
ready
for
its
next
decisive
move
nokia
would
appoint
a
new
chief
executive
as
soon
as
possible
we
set
up
a
work
group
a

committee
to

mid

met
in
london
the
location

the
berkeley
hotel
where
i
usually
stayed
we
quickly
agree
on
the
next
step
marjorie
scardino
would
get
in

with
spencer

a
firm

quickly
get
to

and
prepared
a
list
that
the
three
of
us
go
through
together
this
take
less
than
a

both
be

and
have
be
with
the
company
for
a
long
time
we
decide
to
interview
them

again

day
trip
and
the
candidate
i
have
met
even
so
as
i
turn
thing
over
in
my
mind
during
the
flight
i
wasn
t
sure
we
d
find
the
right
person
for
nokia
from
that
group
we
have
to
be
confident
of
our
choice
and
the
candidate
we
chose
have
to
want
to
lead
nokia
these
be
my
thought
before
i
nod
off
to
the
sound
of
the
aircraft
s
peaceful
hum
there
be
still
two
candidate
to
go
in
short
order
both
have
the
right
background
and
both
could
have
lead
nokia
though
in
slightly
different
di
rections
it
be
easy
for
me
to
put
all
these
candidate
in
order
in
my
mind
my
first
choice
be
an
american
the
second
in
command
of
a
well
know
technology
company
he
be
about
fifty
and
have
spent
a
long
time
with
the
same
firm
rise
through
the
rank
to
his
present
powerful
position
i
met
my
favor
candidate
a
second
time
and
spoke
to
him
a
third
he
would
certainly
have
be
the
right
choice
for
nokia
and
nokia
the
right
choice
for
him
my
candidate
knew
the
world
s
technology
company
inside
out
and
i
like
his
leadership
style
his
value
seem
to
fit
nokia
well
too
but
after
an
extend
period
of
reflection
my
candidate
decide
to
with
draw
the
reason
be
personal
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
nokia
one
external
candidate
remain
for
the
final
round
this
be
the
cana
dian
stephen
elop
he
be
head
of
microsoft
office
and
a
member
of
the
company
s
executive
team
before
that
he
have
have
a
long
career
in
american
company
he
have
work
at
adobe
and
juniper
he
seem
to
be
a
good
salesperson
and
a
decisive
manager
he
also
have
experience
and
expertise
in
software
technology
these
be
the
quality
nokia
need
he
also
love
ice
hockey
which
be
important
to
finn
but
this
played
no
part
in
his
selec
tion
i
like
stephen
elop
s
finnish
style
directness
when
he
spoke
of
his
ex
periences
of
microsoft
and
of
nokia
there
be
nothing
unnecessarily
slick
about
him
he
be
both
enthusiastic
and
capable
he
have
also
do
his
homework
exceptionally
well
he
knew
the
company
he
want
to
lead
he
have
gotten
to
know
the
company
well
a
year
earlier
when
nokia
and
microsoft
announce
their
joint
venture
in
which
he
d
have
a
significant
role
nevertheless
i
put
lot
of
question
to
myself
stephen
elop
seem
a
good
communicator
bursting
with
idea
but
could
he
delegate
effectively
be
he
sufficiently
product
mind
by
which
i
meant
someone
capable
of
achievement
similar
to
those
of
steve
job
beneath
his
canadian
exterior
be
stephen
elop
really
an
american
style
leader
with
all
the
implication
both
positive
and
negative
that
that
entail
would
he
understand
nokia

against
all
odds
stephen
elop
and
me
in
both
the
search
committee
and
nokia
s
full
board
consider
these
ques
tions
the
answer
be
satisfactory
and
so
we
continued
our
discussion
the
external
candidate
have
thus
be
identify
there
be
still
the
two
internal
candidate
whom
i
d
hurriedly
interviewed
in
spring
niklas
savander
be
rule
out
follow
an
interview
so
that
just
two
candidate
remain
in
play
stephen
elop
and
anssi
vanjoki
anssi
vanjoki
have
have
a
long
and
distinguish
career
at
nokia
he
have
believe
in
the
nokia
brand
when
no
one
else
have
trust
it
anssi
arouse
strong
feeling
for
and
against
on
account
of
his
self
assurance
irritability
and
slightly
american
style
if
he
have
be
chosen
as
olli
pekka
kallasvuo
s
successor
some
senior
executive
would
have
left
the
firm
at
least
that
s
what
they
say
even
so
no
one
question
anssi
s
achievement
in
sale
and
marketing
he
return
from
his
travel
with
sale
conclude
even
if
the
customer
weren
t
always
his
most
enthusiastic
fan
over
the
year
anssi
vanjoki
have
mature
as
do
we
all
his
hard
edge
have
soften
but
we
didn
t
base
our
choice
on
personal
quality
this
time
the
business
anssi
brought
in
didn
t
seem
a
strong
enough
qualification
to
give
him
the
job
within
nokia
he
have
be
in
charge
of
the
unit
that
should
have
produce
a
rival
to
the
iphone
he
have
be
responsible
for
the
meego
project
which
have
employ
two
thousand
people
google
s
android
have
need
just
four
hundred
to
five
hundred
people
and
the
meego
project
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
hadn
t
produce
the
desire
result
nowadays
the
smartphone
company
jolla
us
the
same
platform
in
its
phone
but
more
efficiently
so
that
it
get
result
we
ask
anssi
where
he
hop
to
take
nokia
when
he
be
at
the
helm
his
answer
didn
t
put
him
ahead
i
explain
our
decision
to
anssi
who
be
naturally
surprised
and
disap
point
in
august
i
also
told
olli
pekka
that
we
be
about
to
appoint
a
new
chief
executive
he
be
surprised
that
the
process
have
be
so
rapid
but
it
shouldn
t
have
come
as
a
complete
surprise
to
anyone
since
my
jour
ney
to
the
united
state
have
be
leak
to
the
wall
street
journal
which
helpfully
told
its
reader
that
nokia
be
seek
a
new
foreign
ceo
this
story
appear
on
july
and
its
detail
be
pretty
accurate
so
whoever
leak
it
must
have
be
one
of
the
candidate
it
be
a
damage
leak
but
even
though
it
cause
us
to
accelerate
the
process
it
didn
t
affect
the
result
when
nokia
s
board
approve
the
new
chief
executive
in
august
one
board
member
marvel
at
how
quickly
we
d
do
it
he
thought
we
should
have
give
olli
pekka
more
time
everyone
else
thought
differently
that
there
wasn
t
time
to
fritter
away
the
decision

make
at
the
last
minute

didn
t
know
how
thing
would
go
i
would
however

part
as
well
as

epilogue
n
okia
s
success
in
the
s
be
no
foregone
conclusion
it
be
base
on
the
courageous
decision
that
the
company
s
future
lay
in
mobile
phone
and
network
nokia
be
a
company
with
its
back
to
the
wall
it
be
hemorrhage
money
and
its
core
business
have
crumble
the
world
didn
t
owe
nokia
a
living
and
if
the
company
be
to
survive
it
have
to
make
clear
decision
rapidly
the
opportunity
wouldn
t
come
again
if
nokia
have
be
in
a
well
place
the
company
s
youthful
leadership
the
five
couldn
t
have
make
such
radical
decision
the
company
s
very
existence
be
in
question
as
well
as
its
leadership
s
credibility
we
saw
where
our
future
lay
but
it
seem
to
us
that
no
one
share
our
vision
within
nokia
there
be
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
people
be
sus
picious
of
our
change
of
direction
thing
weren
t
help
by
a
consultant
report
that
pour
cold
water
on
the
prospect
for
both
mobile
phone
and
market
indeed
the
report
take
a
gloomy
view
of
the
future
in
every
area
where
nokia
be
active
our
choice
turn
out
to
have
be
the
right
one
and
indeed
the
only
possible
one
our
focus
on
phone
and
network
be
the
prime
mover
of
our
success
but
on
its
own
it
wouldn
t
have
be
enough
we
could
suc
ceed
only
on
the
term
set
by
customer
and
user
nokia
be
know
for
its
engineer
and
its
engineering
ability
and
we
apply
that
experience
to
the
development
of
mobile
phone
a
phone
have
to
look
and
feel
good
and
fit
into
an
envelope
you
should
be
able
to
buy
one
in
any
color
you
want
today
these
point
be
self
evident
but
back
then
they
be
revolutionary
insight
in
this
our
youth
and
lack
of
preconception
help
we
be

and
harri
saukkomaa
and
at
time
passionately
fascinate
with
and
enthusiastic
about
our
prod
ucts
without
that
passion
we
wouldn
t
have
dare
take
such
bold
step
our
vision
be
global
we
decide
not
to
restrict
ourselves
to
the
nordic
region
as
finnish
firm
have
traditionally
do
but
to
make
the
whole
of
eu
rope
our
market
in
time
we
extend
into
asia
especially
china
because
growth
in
develop
market
would
change
the
whole
world
our
product
derive
from
our
vision
nokia
have
something
for
every
consumer
on
the
planet
wherever
they
live
or
however
much
money
they
have
we
didn
t
stubbornly
try
to
push
the
same
model
on
everyone
we
try
to
adapt
to
local
taste
and
customer
evolve
wish
and
we
often
succeed
we
understood
that
the
birth
of
international
mass
marketing
would
help
us
we
be
tightly
bound
to
those
technical
protocol
that
we
believe
to
be
the
best
such
as
gsm
technology
the
same
couldn
t
be
say
for
our
competitor
motorola
and
ericsson
let
alone
the
japanese
or
euro
pean
conglomerate
we
also
succeed
in

over
the
operating
company
our
product
range
be
broad
and
entice
we
have
succeed
in
make
our
product
economically
and
also
in
adapt
our
production
to
the
operating
compa
ny
wish
and
change
in
the
market
when
at
the
start
of
the
ninety
we
realise
that
our
vision
would
save
nokia
we
have
to
make
a
lot
of
decision
in
a
hurry
we
have
to
knock
our
plan
our
logistics
and
our
production
into
shape
so
we
could
grow
into
a
globally
effective
company
we
be
nimble
happy
to
improvise
and
nifty
in
adapt
our
strategy
so
we
be
able
to
pull
the
company
back
from
oblivion
now
we
have
to
focus
on
our
management
system
strategic
plan
ning
and
building
up
the
company
s
resource
tension
between
our
fast
implementation
and
our
slow
process
be
always
at
the
heart
of
nokia
in
we
receive
warn
that
our
management
structure
be
un
fit
for
their
purpose
when
the
whole
company
become
impossible
to
steer
after
that
nokia
design
the
world
s
most
efficient
machinery
for
logistics
production
and
employ
sub
contractor
these
weren
t
area
where
we
make
mistake
in
the
s
our
structure
never
let
us
down
again
after
we
have
learn
our
lesson
we
at
nokia
be
an
efficient
capable
bunch
the
hierarchy

fairly
flat
and

the

of

and
through
them
to
the
company
s
entire
expand

we
live
the
nokia
story
which
be
the
story
of
a
company
that
challenged
old
way
of
think
and
do
and
grow
to
dominate
a
whole
new
market
it
be
a
story
of
unexpected
triumph
our
work
certainly
didn
t
lack
meaning
everyone
at
nokia
push
themselves
to
the
limit
for
the
company
we
face
unfamiliar
and
difficult
issue
we
have
to
overcome
the
problem
of
deal
with
multiple
time
zone
for
example
and
we
have
to
come
to
grip
with
the
culture
of
our
new
market
a
lot
of
this
be
pioneer
work
people
at

be
responsible
for
much
more
than
they
could
ever
have
imagine
even
in
their
wild
dream
their
achievement
be

much
in

of
their

the

open

this

my
own
approach
to

since
i
like
to
stir
thing
up
by

people
to
new
position
and
move
them
to
unknown
corner
of

earth
it
make
nokia
a
workplace
where
good
employee
didn
t
get
stuck
in

their
own

ing
their
little
patch
of

the
collision
between
traditional
and

of

drew
the

forward

a

in

could
succeed
in
a

would
have
seem
impossible
at

it
seem
equally
improbable
that
the
overwhelmingly
dominant
market
leader
could
lose
its

in
just
a
few

why
do
nokia
get
into
such
terrible
trouble
from
on
it
would
be
simple
and
simplistic
to

that

our

some

thought

in

more
than

such
a

of

could
hardly
have

as
a
former

i
too
must
answer
similar
accusation
many
people
suspect
that
as

i
be
still
pull
the
string
from

it
wasn
t
like
that
the
govern

the
executive
board
maintain
a
constant
dialogue
but
they
be
both
clear
on
their

against
the
din
of
the

highly
personalize

i
naturally
examine
my
own

in
the
way
nokia
have
developed
i
m
sure
that
while
i
be
chief

i
could
have
try
more
aggressively
to
boost
the
company
s

expertise
we
recognise
the
need

if

it
could
have
have
a
powerful

it
might

make
people
at

understand
what

all
about
during

the
story
of
nokia
in
the
u
s
market
go
back
much
earlier
however
we
begin
to
sell
mobile
phone
in
the
united
state
at
the
begin
of
the
s
and
they
start
to
take
off
after
when
we
set
up
a
joint
venture
with
the
american
firm
tandy
together
we
set
up
a
factory
to
manufacture

in

they
be
sell
through
nokia
s
own
distribution
network
and
also
through

shack
a
chain
of
electronics
shop
own
by

which
many
american
will
fondly
remember
our
collaboration
with
tan

increase
both
our
production
capability
and
our
understand
of
the
u

the
u
s
mobile
phone
market
have
traditionally
be
difficult
for
every
non
american
company
so
we
savor
motorola
s
defeat
to
the
full
motor
ola
have
dominate
the
u
s
market
and
nokia
s
share
remain
modest
up
to
during
that
time
our
market
share
be
between
and
percent
in
the
united
state
phone
be
chiefly
sell
through
the
nationwide
opera
tor
and
they
take
a
close
interest
in
the
feature
the
phone
have
to
offer
so
nokia
have
to
adapt
to
local
condition
in
we
begin
to
collaborate
with
at
t
wireless
with
rapid
result
by
we
be
the
market
leader
and
later
our
u
s
market
share
go
over
percent
it
be
still
more
than
percent
in
we
have
long
believe
that
the
power
of
the
u
s
operating
company
to
dictate
the
market
would
last
forever
this
belief
be
prove
wrong
between
and
the
operating
company
have
long
try
to
tell
us
that
in
the
united
state
there
be
no
demand
for
smartphones
cost
more
than
about
nokia
have
try
hard
to
make
what
the
customer
want
then
apple
come
along
and
launch
the
iphone
with
a
price
tag
of
more
than
but
apple
have
create
something
really
new
a
wonderful

for
the

the

you
don

rise
to
it
the
deepest
essence
of
global
market
will
elude
you
after
i
step
down
as
chairman
of
nokia
in
the
spring
of
i
begin
to
put
the
finish
touch
to
this
book
it
be
nearly
ready
at
the
begin
ning
of
september
when
it
be
announce
that
ownership
of
nokia
s
mobile
phone
division
would
be
transfer
to
our
historic
arch
enemy
mi
crosoft
the
main
reaction
in
finland
be
one
of
shock
and
disbelief
strong
feeling
come
to
the
surface
but
against
the
background
of
history
the
deci
sion
doesn
t
seem
so
exceptional
nokia
have
make
significant
disposal
in
the
past
the
spin
off
of
the
paper
division
in
the
s
which
i
myself
have
push
forward
have
be
a
personally
painful
decision
after
all
nokia
have
have
its
origin
in
the
forest
industry
back
in
the
s
the
mobile
phone
have
a
great
symbolic
significance
finn
have
form
a
strong
emotional
bond
with
their
nokia
mobile
although
in
the
historical
context
the
brand
have
be
built
up
in
rather
a
short
time
less
than
year
this
show
the
power
of
the
nokia
story
to
many
outsider
mobile
and
nokia
be
one
and
the
same
it
s
an
issue
of
the
company
s
and
even
finland
s
identity
nokia
s
board
s
decision
to
sell
be
dramatic
and
courageous
even
so
for
me
and
for
everyone
else
who
have
a
long
association
with
nokia
it
be
sad
to
see
more
than
year
worth
of
finnish
engineering
expertise
sell
abroad
but
we
should
look
ahead
can
the
company
rebuild
itself
to
benefit
from
the
expertise
it
retains
other
question
come
to
mind
since
nokia
isn
t
know
for
quit
many
feel
disappointed
and
wonder
why
nokia
should
throw
in
the
towel
when
there
s
still
so
much
to
play
for
be
this
really
a
mature
area
nokia
have
reject
takeover
bid
even
when
the
company
be
in
a
dire
situation
for
example
when
siemens
approach
the
board
in
with
the
intention
of
buying
our
cellular
system
unit
we
barely
give
them
the
time
of
day
we
have
a
clear
vision
of
the
future
and
it
be
on
that
basis
that
we
solve
our
jorma
ollila
epilogue
and
harri
saukkomaa
problem
one
at
a
time
sell
wasn
t
on
our
agenda
the
cellular
system
unit
have
a
place
in
our
strategy
for
the
next
five
year
and
that
work
out
as
it
should
it
be
the
same
story
in
the
logistics
crisis
nokia
have
already
be
condemn
as
a
loser
but
we
put
our
structure
straight
double
our
investment
and
our
work
hour
and
return
as
victor
soon
after
the
deal
microsoft
s
real
plan
become
clear
and
there
be
nothing
good
for
finland
about
them
microsoft
wound
down
its
finnish
operation
leave
only
a
product
development
center
because
it
have
de
cided
not
to
invest
in
phone
production
the
change
in
the
company
s
chief
executive
have
an
impact
on
this
though
nokia
have
be
sideline
it
still
take
on
new
business
the
most
important
move
be
the
decision
at
the
begin
of
to
buy
alcatel
lucent
the
deal
be
complete
in
december
this
be
the
big
ac
quisition
in
finland
s
history
it
enable
nokia
to
reach
the
same
level
as
ericsson
and
huawei
which
have
previously
dominate
the
global
network
business
between
them
the
profitability
of
nokia
s
network
business
also
strengthen
overtak
ing
ericsson
s
in
i
believe
that
amalgamate
alcatel
lucent
and
nokia
will
consume
a
lot
of
leadership
time
and
organizational
energy
over
the
next
couple
of
year
but
it
offer
the
chance
to
become
first
in
the
field
both
by
size
and
capabili
ty
the
opportunity
for
growth
be
modest
but
the
sector
will
be
absolutely
central
in
building
a
networked
infrastructure
once
more
it
will
demand
brilliant
technical
ability

technology
company
that
conquer

the

so
this
be
a

the

sprang
from

these

ups
weren
t
built
on

of

subcontractor
of
nokia
or
as
its
shareholder
the
ensue
prosperity
spread
throughout
finland
nokia
may
have
sometimes
be
too
big
for
finland
in
that
it
may
have
take
too
large
a
share
of
available
resource
but
a
small
country
doesn
t
always
have
the
mean
to
develop
a
fully
diversified
economy
what
next
for
nokia
i
m
an
optimist
history
give
a
hint
that
after
a
metamorphosis
nokia
will
probably
find
a
new
area
into
which
it
can
grow
this
won
t
happen
on
the
basis
of
the
idea
of
one
or
two
leader
but
through
a
broad
group
of
motivate
nokia
engineer
for
whom
good
leadership
will
act
as
a
stimulus
i
ve
have
the
chance
to
observe
several
such
situation
and
every
one
of
them
have
be
fascinate
the
key
word
be
trust
trust
in
peo
ple
and
in
let
them
do
what
they
want
in
today
s
increasingly
individu
alistic
atmosphere
a
team
spirit
expertise
and
a
humble
approach
still
have
a
crucial
role
to
play
more
easily
say
than
do
perhaps
but
i
believe
i
will
yet
see
many
such
miracle
at
nokia
jorma
ollila
and
harri
saukkomaa
