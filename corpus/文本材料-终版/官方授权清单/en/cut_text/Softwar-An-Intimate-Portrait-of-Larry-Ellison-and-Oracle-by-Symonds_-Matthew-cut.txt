
larry
and
me
i
first
met
larry
ellison
in
his
office
at
oracle
s
redwood
shore
headquarters
on
december
i
have
recently
become
the
economist
s
technology
and
communication
editor
and
this
be
the
first
of
what
become
regular
visit
to
silicon
valley
i
have
just
complete
two
day
of
meeting
at
microsoft
s
campus
at
redmond
washington
mile
to
the
north
where
an
array
of
impressively
on
message
executive
have
be
wheel
out
for
my
benefit
though
unfortunately
not
bill
gate
himself
i
would
see
him
on
my
next
visit
i
be
assure
but
there
be
a
strong
hint
that
face
time
with
bill
be
conditional
on
the
economist
s
take
a
more
sympathetic
line
toward
microsoft
in
the
antitrust
case
that
the
department
of
justice
be
prepare
against
it
after
a
similar
turn
involve
oracle
s
most
senior
manager
i
have
be
promise
time
with
ellison
himself
it
turn
out
i
d
picked
a
bad
afternoon
i
didn
t
know
it
at
the
time
but
oracle
be
about
to
issue
its
first
earnings
warn
since
the
firm
have
nearly
go
under
in
the
economic
crisis
in
asia
have
take
its
toll
and
in
north
america
slow
license
sale
of
oracle
s
most
important
product
its
all
conquer
database
seem
to
support
the
argument
of
some
analyst
that
oracle
be
dominate
a
market
that
be
get
close
to
saturation
the
follow
day
the
stock
lose
percent
of
its
value
as
i
wait
i
could
see
ellison
through
the
glass
door
of
the
eleventh
floor
boardroom
huddle
in
conversation
he
be
already
an
hour
and
a
half
late
for
his
interview
with
me
and
i
knew
he
have
to
fly
to
new
york
later
in
the
day
to
deliver
a
keynote
speech
at
an
internet
conference
i
have
heard
story
about
ellison
s
lateness
and
didn
t
believe
the
press
flak
s
distract
excuse
about
an
emergency
be
the
cause
of
the
delay
let
s
leave
it
for
another
time
i
suggest
grumpily
but
at
that
moment
i
be
suddenly
ushered
into
ellison
s
handsome
office
with
its
expensive
japanese
artifact
and
panoramic
view
across
the
bay
despite
the
strain
he
must
have
be
under
ellison
be
courtesy
itself
after
apologize
profusely
for
his
lateness
he
begin
to
talk
about
technology
his
theme
be
the
failure
of
the
prevail
computer
architecture
of
the
day
know
as
client
server
because
the
job
of
run
software
be
share
between
server
computer
in
corporate
data
center
and
their
desktop
pc
client
he
believe
client
server
be
an
evolutionary
dead
end
that
be
distribute
complexity
with
disastrous
consequence
the
answer
be
a
new
model
of
compute
base
on
the
internet
in
which
the
complexity
and
the
compute
would
be
hidden
in
the
network
user
would
be
able
to
access
everything
they
need
through
a
web
browser
that
could
be
run
by
a
machine
much
less
expensive
and
cantankerous
than
a
pc
a
network
computer
there
be
nothing
unexpected
in
this
it
be
a
drum
that
ellison
have
be
beating
for
some
time
and
conceptually
it
be
little
different
from
sun
microsystems
s
famous
slogan
that
the
network
be
the
computer
ellison
have
first
declare
the
pc
a
ridiculous
device
at
a
technology
conference
in
paris
more
than
two
year
earlier
the
speech
at
the
height
of
the
hoopla
surround
the
release
of
window
and
in
front
of
an
audience
that
include
bill
gate
cause
a
minor
sensation
ellison
ran
through
a
well
rehearse
routine
but
there
be
nonetheless
something
extraordinarily
compelling
about
his
argument
he
seem
to
be
speak
directly
to
the
problem
that
anyone
who
depend
on
computer
at
work
knew
all
too
well
the
crash
prone
pc
with
its
incomprehensible
error
message
the
incredible
effort
of
maintain
thousand
of
pc
across
a
company
the
apparently
insurmountable
difficulty
of
get
reasonable
performance
and
scalability
across
wide
area
network
the
argument
seem
utterly
rational
and
commonsensical
while
ellison
himself
be
passionate
and
funny

over
the
next
three
year
ellison
be
prove
to
be
far
more
right
than
wrong
the
network
computer
itself
prove
to
be
a
dazzle
digression
ellison
have
be
right
about
how
the
internet
would
change
the
way
computer
be
use
but
most
people
still
reckon
that
the
best
way
of
get
to
the
internet
be
through
a
pc
a
few
network
computer
be
make
by
oracle
and
a
loosely
knit
coalition
of
microsoft
s
enemy
such
as
ibm
and
sun
microsystems
but
tumble
pc
price
and
the
limitation
impose
by
slow
dial
up
connection
quickly
condemn
them
to
irrelevance
microsoft
crow
ellison
be
make
to
look
a
bit
foolish
but
the
pc
versus
the
nc
be
a
sideshow
that
stole
attention
from
the
real
struggle
for
the
future
of
compute
what
matter
be
that
ellison
have
understood
well
than
anyone
the
potential
impact
of
the
internet
on
enterprise
compute
in
general
and
on
oracle
in
particular
while
the
technology
analyst
in
the
investment
bank
and
the
consultancy
confidently
predict
the
mature
of
the
database
market
ellison
realize
that
the
internet
would
exponentially
increase
both
the
number
of
database
transaction
and
the
number
of
people
who
would
interact
with
oracle
s
database
that
would
mean
more
license
growth
than
the
analyst
have
dream
of
every
time
someone
look
for
a
book
on
amazon
com
bought
stock
through
e
trade
or
put
something
up
for
auction
on
ebay
that
person
be
use
an
oracle
database
ellison
believe
that
the
database
would
be
the
essential
platform
for
internet
compute
effectively
displace
the
once
all
important
operating
system
within
company
the
same
thing
would
happen
instead
of
business
software
be
use
by
only
a
handful
of
specialist
internet
base
application
could
be
extend
to
anyone
with
authorization
and
a
browser
every
time
one
of
those
application
be
use
there
be
a
good
chance
that
it
would
query
the
database
that
the
application
ran
on
when
the
networking
giant
cisco
system
talk
of
have
a
url
for
everything
we
do
it
be
another
way
of
say
that
everybody
they
employ
be
constantly
use
the
firm
s
oracle
database
in
a
client
server
world
less
sophisticated
database
such
as
microsoft
s
sql
server
might
have
become
good
enough
for
many
business
but
with
internet
compute
come
the
need
for
database
that
could
support
million
of
user
at
once
with
the
come
of
e
business
oracle
s
database
become
at
least
as
much
an
essential
element
of
infrastructure
as
cisco
s
router
or
the
big
server
computer
make
by
the
like
of
sun
that
be
also
back
in
fashion
it
be
no
coincidence
that
in
early
those
three
company
the
three
superstar
of
the
internet
have
a
combine
market
value
of
nearly
a
trillion
dollar
if
that
be
a
stroke
of
luck
for
oracle
what
wasn
t
be
ellison
s
decision
to
the
horror
of
many
colleague
and
customer
to
abandon
all
far
development
of
client
server
base
application
and
concentrate
the
firm
s
entire
engineering
effort
on
building
for
the
new
compute
architecture
of
the
internet
while
rival
in
the
apps
business
such
as
the
german
powerhouse
sap
and
peoplesoft
talk
up
the

and
put
a
web

end
on
some
of
their
product
ellison
go
much
far
oracle
be
the
first
establish
software
firm
to
risk
everything
on
the
new
paradigm
his
rationale
be
simple
oracle
could
never
hope
to
be
number
one
in
enterprise
application
as
long
as
client
server
prevail
it
be
fat
always
to
play
second
fiddle
to
sap
whose
strength
in
the
enterprise
apps
market
almost
match

s
dominance
in

by
get
to
the
internet
first
assume
that
the
software
could
be
make
to
work
ellison
would
force
oracle
s
competitor
to
become
follower
gain
vital
time
to
market
over
them
and
crucially
in
an
industry
in
which
perception
be
as
important
as
reality
if
ellison
s
bet
come
off
it
would
make
oracle
appear
very
cool
the
strategy
of
harness
internet
hype
and
turn
oracle
from
stodgy
to
hip
ellison
s
mantra
have
become
the
internet
change
everything
help
drive
oracle
s
market
cap
in
to
within
touch
distance
of
a
microsoft
brought
low
by
the
government
s
antitrust
case
ellison
even
briefly
overtook
bill
gate
as
the
world
s
richest
man
with
a
net
worth
of
more
than
billion
if
newspaper
and
magazine
article
about
ellison
still
found
plenty
of
space
to
describe
in
love
detail
his
high
roll
way
they
be
also
force
to
concede
that
there
be
substance
too
even
though
ellison
refuse
to
conform
to
their
idea
of
what
an
ber
geek
should
look
and
sound
like
gate
have
that
one
sewn
up
there
be
a
grow
willingness
to
concede
that
although
as
arrogant
and
addict
to
hyperbole
as
ever
ellison
probably
be
an
authentic
business
and
technology
visionary

in
december
when
i
be
think
about
write
this
book
ellison
told
me
that
he
be
prepare
to
bet
the
company
all
over
again
in
a
do
or
die
attempt
to
make
oracle
not
just
the
big
software
company
but
the
world
s
most
influential
corporation
to
ellison
that
meant
not
so
much
passing
microsoft
in
revenue
although
that
would
be
nice
but
oracle
have
become
the
successor
to
industrial
icon
such
as
ford
and
ibm
whose
product
and
vision
have
change
the
way
the
world
work
he
couldn
t
bear
to
include
microsoft
in
that
pantheon
at
first
it
sound
like
a
characteristic
piece
of
ellisonian
exaggeration
with
ellison
you
never
quite
knew
whether
he
be
be
provocative
for
the
sake
of
it
or
whether
he
really
meant
it
before
decide
to
do
the
book
i
go
to
see
him
at
his
home
in
atherton
i
need
to
gauge
how
serious
he
really
be
after
talk
through
the
day
and
well
into
the
night
i
conclude
that
he
be
very
serious
indeed
his
logic
go
like
this
the
arrival
of
the
internet
meant
we
be
now
living
at
the
begin
of
the
information
age
it
s
the
information
age
not
the
fuck
operating
system
age
and
oracle
it
just
so
happen
be
the
lead
company
for
help
people
to
manage
their
information
software
be
the
product
that
make
the
world
go
round
and
the
software
business
accord
to
ellison
be
and
always
have
be
base
on
the
principle
of
winner
take
all
ibm
and
microsoft
in
their
heyday
have
demonstrate
that
but
now
the
rule
of
the
game
have
shift
in
oracle
s
favor
and
it
be
its
turn
to
become
the
dominant
force
in
compute
ibm
and
microsoft
have
both
bestrode
their
respective
era
era
that
have
be
define
by
the
prevail
computer
architecture
of
the
day
the
mainframe
follow
by
client
server
ellison
be
convince
that
oracle
be
now
poise
to
claim
the
mantle
that
microsoft
have
snatch
from
ibm
but
while
these
two
company
reign
have
be
temporary
ellison
reckon
oracle
could
be
on
top
for
a
very
long
time
he
believe
that
the
world
be
inexorably
move
toward
one
network
the
internet
one
database
from
oracle
he
say
i
really
don
t
think
there
will
be
another
paradigm
shift
this
be
it
but
the
database
alone
could
not
bring
oracle
the
degree
of
success
that
ellison
be
after
for
that
he
need
oracle
s
application
to
become
the
enterprising
compute
equivalent
of
microsoft
s
ubiquitous
office
in
other
word
oracle
s
release
i
or
the
e
business
suite
as
ellison
prefer
to
call
it
would
need
to
become
the
standard
package
of
application
for
automate
the
world
s
business
release
i
have
ship
some
six
month
earlier
at
the
begin
of
june
and
ellison
be
convince
it
be
go
to
turn
the
economy
of
business
compute
on
its
head
engineer
for
the

from

it
be
one
of
the
big

most
complex

that
s
how
company
put

today

not
for

longer
if
ellison

anything

be

that
among

only
oracle
be
big

ellison
lean

when
i

about
it
we
have
this
one

i
know
that
unless

screw
up
it

so
much
of

conventional

interest
at
one
time
and
with
few
ally
seem
unnecessarily
foolhardy
i
wonder
whether
ellison
would
have
the
stamen
for
such
a
grueling
challenge
he
be
fifty
six
year
old
and
thanks
to
the
percent
stake
in
oracle
that
he
have
clung
to
through
thick
and
thin
since
the
initial
public
offering
in
he
be
wealthy
beyond
even
his
own

although
he
always
talk
about
technology
and
oracle
with
passion
and
intensity
he
didn
t
have
the
methodical
relentlessness
that
make
bill
gate
so
formidable
and
fear
by
his
own
admission
ellison
be
not

ellison
have
a
reputation
for
be
easily
bore
by
the
process
of
run
a

and
often
take
time
off
leave
the

to
senior

one
of
the
reason
often
trot
out
for

hire
ray

a
senior
executive
credit
with
bring
order
and
discipline
to
the

allow
ellison
just
to

the

thing
and
bunk
off
to
sail
his

whenever
he
felt

lane
have
left

nearly
eighteen
month
before
after
fall
out
with
ellison
since
then
ellison
have
take
full
control
of
the

how
likely
be
it
that
he
would
he
stay
the
course
one
reason
to
be
skeptical
be
that
ellison
just
seem
to
have
too
many
thing
go
on

if

he
have
agree
to
provide
a

for

be
he

he
would

about
the

team

his

i
be
sure
however
that
ellison
have
no
intention
of
stand
in
the
background
obediently
signing
check
and
if
he
be
planning
on

in
some
of
the

as
he
have
hint
what
sort
of
commitment
in
term
of
preparation
and
week
spent
away
from

do
that
imply
finally
although
i
didn
t
know
then
there
be
even
the
possibility
that
ellison
might
start
a
new
family
although
ellison
s
view
on
monogamy
would
never
make
him
a
standard
bearer
for
the

majority
his

with

and
a

ellison
have
pretty
much
convince
himself
that
be
a

be
just
something
he

not

it
wasn

something
that
he

about

be
sensitive
enough
not
to
want
to
put
any

it
be
there
all
the

i
have
be
swept
along
by
ellison
s
argument

exhilarate
by
his
recklessness

the
sheer
grandeur
of
his
optimism
as
usual
everything
he
be
say
make
perfect
sense
and
be
intellectually
compelling

me
thought
he
s
right
if
the

business
suite
be
all
he

it
do
why
shouldn

become
the
most
important
company
on
earth
however
oracle
s
aggressive
and
sometimes
arrogant
style
have
make
it
plenty
of
enemy
and
with
the
launch
of
the
e
business
suite
it
seem
that
ellison
be
intent
on
make
a
great
many
more
critic
have
accuse
ellison
and
oracle
of
overclaiming
and
hype
product
that
sometimes
fail
to
live
up
to
their
billing
not
exactly
a
unique
crime
in
the

one
that

on

although

the
second
big
enterprise
application
business
in
the

the
history
of
its

be
to
put
it
mildly
torrid
if
the

didn

on
ellison

there
would

of

desperate
for

to
fulfill
what
he
saw
as
its
true
potential
but
be
he
prepared
to
do
what
might
be

would
not
dream

to
even
the
most
senior
oracle
sale
executive
be
curious
to
meet
ellison
not

because
of
his
often
controversial
celebrity
these
event
already
have
an
establish
pattern
ellison
usually
start
by
describe

s
own
experience
of
transform
itself
into
an
e
business
and
save
a
billion
dollar
worth
of
cost
along
the
way
in
particular
he
like
to
paint
a
lurid
picture
of
the
inefficiency
of
oracle
s
information
system
before
the
internet
make
a
different
model
of
compute
possible
it
s
a
riff
design
to
put
the
guest
at
ease
if
oracle
the
lead
provider
of
management
information
system
to
most
of
the
world
s
big
company
couldn
t
handle
its
own
data
properly
it
s
okay
for
others
to
admit
that
they
re
have
problem
ellison
have
told
me
that
in
america
the
occasion
often
take
on
the
flavor
of
a
confessional
a
kind
of
ceo
anonymous
in
which
the
leader
of
household
name
company
would
compete
with
one
another
to
tell
horror
story
about
expensive
computer
system
that
have
take
forever
to
install
and
never
deliver
it
didn
t
seem
to
worry
ellison
that
at
least
some
of
these
nightmare
experience
involve
oracle
software
and
consultant
it
be
all
the
fault
of
the
so
call
client
server
model
of
compute
that
microsoft
have
help
to
foist
on
the
world
we
re
all
in
the
same
boat
he
would
say
pay
top
dollar
for

that
tell
us
almost
nothing
about

warns

the
inscrutable
east
he
may
find
his
audience
less
responsive
than
he
s
use
to
and
so
it
be
the

who
have
turn

nancy

the

of

but
there
be
no
buzz
in
the
room
it
s
as
if
the
guest
be
overawe
by
ellison
s
presence
and
be
not
quite
sure
what
s
expect
of
them
ellison
start
the
meeting
with
his
well
hone
account
of
what
it
mean
to
be
an
e
business
and
oracle
s
own
epiphany
and
redemption
the
story
be
ramble
and
funny
but
the
message
be
clear
by
streamline
its
process
and
use
its
own
software
and
the
internet
to
automate
them
oracle
not
only
save
billion
in
annual
cost
but
become
an
organization
that
be
far
more
responsive
to
the
need
of
its
customer
what
s
more
as
all
this
have
be
achieve
by
centralize
information
and
go
from
literally
thousand
of
server
computer
to
just
a
handful
it
meant
be
prepared
to
spend
less
not
more
on
information
technology
the
obstacle
to
realize
such
gain
be
no
longer
technological
it
be
whether
the
people
within
a
company
be
prepared
to
embrace
change
and
that
wouldn
t
happen
unless
senior
management
be
ready
to
think
how
the
business
should
operate
for
the
next
twenty
five
year
in
the
light
of
the
internet
ellison
end
with
the
challenge
be
you
willing
to
pay
less
that
really
be
the
question
perhaps
the
guest
think
the
question
be
rhetorical
but
after
an
uncomfortable
pause
ellison
crank
himself
up
again
with
an
amplification
of
why
spending
less
can
result
in
well
information
it
s
a
bit
repetitive
but
it
give
williams
the
chance
to
add
that
you
don
t
need
to
be
a
software
firm
like
oracle
to
do
these
thing

what

accomplish
in
a
short
time
that
seem
to
get
them
go
from
then
on
it
s
a
competition
to
show
how
switch
on
they
all
be
they
want
to
know
about
the
future
of

after
the
dot
com
crash
how
to

their

and
skepticism
about
what
s
in
it
for
them
ellison
have
an
answer
for
each
of
them
his
line
on
e
commerce
be
that
the
internet
can
make
good
company
well
but
it
won
t
turn
bad
business
into
good
one
he
reckons
that
there
won
t
turn
out
to
be
that
many
brand
new
company
create
by

say
be
a
fantasy
the
world
have
go
a
little
bit
crazy
on
the
training
issue
he
say
when
we
say
there
s
a
training
problem
it
s
usually
because
a
product
be
too
difficult
to
use
if
you
can
use
yahoo
or
amazon
without
any
training
you
should
be
able
to
use
most
business
software
with
little
or
no
training
unfortunately
our
engineer
usually
stop
short
of
make
our
product
as
easy
to
use
as
possible
the
best
and
most
leveraged
approach
be
to
make
our
software
as
easy
to
use
as
ebay
where
seventy
year
old
first
time
computer
user
manage

sell
antique
the
key
to
encourage
business
partner
to
join
online
procurement
exchange
and
marketplace
be
to
convince
them
that
it
would
make
life
easy
for
them
by
give
them
the
opportunity
to
increase

through
well
and

information
about

the

ellison
to

from

have
abruptly
part

nine
month
earlier
actually
ellison

competitor
collaboration
be
quite
difficult
nothing
quite

all
the

over
the
long
term
will
just
not
work
in
my
opinion
he
reckons
that
it
will
go
back
to
be
a
ford

the
model
for

b
b
exchange
he
argues
be
the
one
that

have
built
for

you
need
an

to
be
built
around
one
nucleate
company
strong
enough
both
to
drive

to
provide

he
say
mr

look
a
little
take
aback
ellison
repeat
his
mantra
that
the
watchword
of
e
business
be
automate

and
the
meeting
break
up
although
the

seem
happy
enough
and
be
make
all
the
right
noise
about
want
to
work
with
oracle
on
their
e
business
plan
it
s
hard
to
gauge
whether
it
s
be
a
success
after
the
long
flight
and
the
distress
over
the
cat
ellison
s
performance
have
be
by
his
normal
standard
a
little
flat
and
without
much
come
back
across
the
table
to
stimulate
him
he
s
be
mostly
on
autopilot

the

claim
be
the
role
of
smes

as
the
drive

ellison
remark
that
smes
have
also
become
the
main
engine
of

s
own
growth
and
point
out
that
if

can

automate
the

the

the
hutchinson
that

business
with

won
t
be
automate
either
no
matter
what
they
spend
on
it
but
wu
be
doubtful
whether
oracle
make
the
kind
of
simple
and
affordable
software
that
these
people
would
buy
they
be
not
like
dot
coms
he
say
they
have
never
heard
the
word
burn
rate
and
they
can
t
afford
to
spend
million
on
complicate
and
interminable
system
implementation
this
be
just
the
opening
that
ellison
want
a
big
part
of
his
message
be
that
oracle
s
customer
should
install
the
software
in
plain
vanilla
form
and
avoid
expensive
modification
but
he
suddenly
make
the
extraordinary
claim
that
oracle
be
intend
to
get
the
initial
purchase
price
of
the
application
suite
for
small
business
down
to
and
get
the
software
up
and
run
almost
before
the
ink
dry
on
the
contract
in
other
word
in
just
a
few
hour
williams
look
astonish
but
it
s
quintessential
ellison
because
he
s
already
work
out
in
his
own
mind
how
something
like
this
could
in
theory
be
do
it
follow
that
all
the
practical
difficulty
have
already
be
overcome
it
s
also
an
opportunity
to
expound
on
a
core
ellison
theme
the
war
against
complexity
software
have
to
be
make
much
more
simple
compute
have
become
so
complex
that
customer
have
to
hire
expert
just
to
explain
the
industry
s
product
everyone
have
be
try
to
make
their
product
more
powerful
and
in
the
process
they
have
become
more
difficult
to
use

by
contrast
with
its
e
business
suite

deliver
an
integrate
close

that

percent
of
what
you

straight
out

if
she
s
go
to
have
to
go
through
the
whole
upgrade
nightmare
again
ellison
have
two
answer
the
first
be
that
the
internet
model
be
the
last
model
of
compute
this
be
it
he
say
what
make
him
so
sure
be
that
internet
base
computer
network
work
in
a
way
similar
to
all
the
other
network
that
we
depend
on
from
water
as
invent
by
the
roman
to
electricity
and
the
telephone
the
second
be
that
migration
from
client
server
to
the
internet
isn
t
trivial
but
shouldn
t
take
too
long
as
long
as
oracle
can
get
the
time
with
senior
manager
to
work
out
how
to
change
standardize
and
simplify
every
business
process
for
the
internet
implementation
can
be
very
rapid
the
model
use
so
successfully
with
ge
power
he
claim
oracle
be
prepared
to
work
on
a
guaranteed
fix
price
fix
time
basis
he
promise
we
will
make
a
very
big
difference
tse
doesn
t
look
wholly
reassure
and
she
s
right
not
to
be
put
the
e
business
suite
into
a
brand
new
plant
such
as
ge
power
s
turbine
factory
in
hungary
should
go
fairly
smoothly
but
large
scale
upgrade
from
legacy
client
server
system
tend
to
be
a
lot
more
painful
than
ellison
be
admit

as
the
car
race
through
the
traffic
back
to
the
grand
hyatt
ellison
casually
suggests
a
change
of
plan
for
the
weekend
i
thought
that
after
shanghai
we
might
just
fly
down
to
tahiti
for
a
couple
of
day
r
and
r
the
boat
the
foot
ronin
be
down
there
and
crewed
so
we
might
as
well
use
it
what
really
seem
to
tickle
him
be
the
idea
of
jetting
straight
from
tahiti
on
sunday
night
to
the
next
customer
engagement
with
healthsouth
in
birmingham
alabama
i
bet
that
s
a
route
that
nobody
s
flown
before

to
birmingham
back
at
the

then
some
whenever

arrives

scurry
ahead
clearing
a

opening

bobbing

even

the
chef
be
brought

and

to

go
out
of
his
way
to

in

turn
it
into
something
very
like

him
later
the

actually
a
good
deal
more
intellectually
serious
than

ellison
be
understandably
relieve
he
s
be
on
the

that

of
an
onrushing
car
in
fact
the

turn
out
to
be
pretty
bad
the
chinese
oprah
s
idea
of
intellectual
seriousness
be
to
keep
ask
variation
of
the
same
question
over
and
over
again
do

ellison
becomes
increasingly
desperate
to
find
way
of
not
repeat
himself
even
when
the
audience
get
its
chance
it
s
the

question
all
over
again
clearly
the
chinese
think
be
number
two
be
a
pretty
awful
fate
watch
out
america
it
get
bad
when
ellison
be
ask
about
something
different
how
important
be
china
to
oracle
as
a
source
of
engineering
talent
it
s
get
more
important
all
the
time
he
say
in
that
case
say
another
member
of
the

how
about

d
out
here
from

question
from
the

in

to
ellison
that
maybe
there

among
the
guest
er
just
how
many
people
be
there
here
from

asks
nervously
a

half
appear

be
the
answer
christ

so
many

down
luckily
the

with

of
large
armchair
on
three
side
xu
and
ellison
sit
on
a
slightly
raise
dais
their
respective
interpreter
perch
absurdly
just
behind
them
like

xu
look
every
inch
the
tough
bos
of
a
tough
city
the
mayorship
of
shanghai
be
not
only
one
of
the
big
political
job
in
china
it
can
lead
to
the
very
top
both
president
jiang

and
the
country

be
at
his
diplomatic
smoothest
shanghai
be
one
of
the
most
excite
city
in
the
world
with
the
fast
growth
and
the
most
crane
this
be
a
line
he
clearly
like
and
it
s
one
that
he
always
look
forward
to
return
to
though
it
s
not
fascinate
enough
to
keep
him
in
town
for
more
than
a
few
hour
on
this
trip
xu
be
equally
flatter
about
ellison
s
accomplishment
and
the
contribution
oracle
be
make
to
the
new
china
he
then
give
a
little
soliloquy
about
the
importance
of
the
internet
to
shanghai
the
need
to
keep
constantly
upgrade
technology
and
the
city
s
already
quite
impressive
communication
infrastructure
the
growth
of
wireless
be
an
example
of
how
the
new
shanghai
be
embrace
technology
with
more
than
million
mobile
phone
among
a
population
of
million
he
then
asks
ellison
the
question
that
it
seem
everyone
in
china
be
desperate
to
have
answer
what
s
likely
to
happen
to
technology
and
internet
stock
he
s
very
worried
he
say
now
speak
in
quite
passable
english
that
the
experience
of
loss
in
the
last
few
month
could
dent
the
appetite
of
inexperienced
chinese
investor
to
hold
stock
you
have
to
pinch
yourself
to
remember
that
this
be
a
communist
speak
not
the
chairman
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
the
mayor
suddenly
asks
what
oracle
can
do
to
put
the
city
s
custom
operation
online
ellison
and
derek
williams
can
hardly
contain
their
excitement
they
assure
xu
that
they
have
the
software
ready
to
go
and
the
efficiency
will
naturally
be
astound

be
make
to
meet
with
custom
official
and
begin
scoping
the
project
a
meeting
that
be
conceive
as
little
more
than
an
opportunity
to
show
the
flag
and
drum
up
some
local
medium
coverage
have
turn
out
to
be
a
lot
more
interest
in
fact
aside
from
the
weirdness
of
the
lunchtime
tv
show
everything
have
go
amazingly
smoothly
but
now
we
re
not
go

the
senior
of

have
look
at

it
s
a
long
thursday
ellison
be
back
in
the
office
by
early
afternoon
to
take
a
review
meeting
with
the
application
group
the
meeting
in
the
eleventh
floor
boardroom
be
already
under
way
by
the
time
ellison
swing
in
it
s
as
if
he
have
just
step
out
to
get
a
coke
from
the
fridge
rather
than
flown
in
from
china
although
the
atmosphere
be
typically
silicon
valley
informal
whisper
side
conversation
tinker
with
pda
and
cell
phone
frequent
excursion
to
pick
up
juice
and
soda
from
the
fridge
across
the
way
and
no
one
be
obviously
chair
the
proceeding
the
focus
subtly
shift
toward
ellison
it
s
all
fairly
routine
stuff
there
s
an
update
on
how
a
few
big
e
business
suite
installation
be
go
the
most
important
be
a
major
crm
installation
at
silicon
valley
neighbor
hewlett
packard
that
s
about
to
be
roll
out
to
nearly
four
thousand
marketing
people
and
the
vital
go
live
at
ge
power
in
hungary
the
good
news
be
that
there
be
no
software
issue
but
one
small
cloud
on
the
horizon
concern
the
way
ge
be
handle
the
next
eb
implementation
at
its
houston
plant
ron
wohl
oracle
s
joint
head
of
application
development
say
that
ge
be
warn
that
houston
be
likely
to
be
more
complex
than
hungary
because
local
manager
be
resist
the
approach
use
in
hungary
where
process
be
adapt
to
work
with
the
software
rather
than
the
other
way
around
at
oracle
this
have
become
tantamount
to
heresy
a
big
part
of
the
eb
campaign
be
to
convince
customer
to
take
the
software
in
plain
vanilla
form
and
install
it
rapidly
without
modification
wohl
say
that
it
may
be
possible
to
sort
thing
out
at
a
meeting
of
the
ge
oracle
steer
committee
in
a
fortnight
but
if
that
fails
either
he
or
ellison
may
have
to
go
back
to
ge
power
system
bos
and
current
oracle
poster
boy
john
rice
and
persuade
him
to
tell
the
houston
people
to
see
sense
ellison
have
a
well
idea
tell
houston
he
say
they
must
write
down
on
paper
exactly
why
they
have
to
be
different
from
hungary
don
t
let
them
argue
about
it
at
the
steer
committee
they
ll
come
up
with
some
wonderful
reason
and
put
up
a
great
argument
make
them
write
it
down
he
say
the
next
day
ellison
usually
doesn
t
arrive
in
the
office
until
about
in
the
afternoon
be
take
up
with

with
the

and
second
with
marketing
to
approve
some
press
ad
oracle
s
application

have
be
a
problem
for
a
couple
of
year
app

be
a
vital
layer
in
the
software

of

the
two
main

in
the

bea

ibm
with
its
websphere
product
range
market
them
as

business
platform
or
even
as
the
operating
system
of

but

have
suffer
from
poor
performance
in
run

write
in
the
popular
java
program

because
oracle
s
java

have
be
take
from
its
database
instead
of
be
design
from
scratch
for
the
app
server
as
oracle
be
a
pioneer
of
e
business
it
s
strategically
damage
and
frankly
embarrass
for
it
not
to
have
a
competitive
product
the
option
on
the
table
be
to
resell
a
direct
rival
s
product
such
as
bea
system
persevere
with
develop
an
in
house
solution
or
do
a
licensing
deal
with
a
tiny
firm
in
sweden
call
orion
basically
just
two
guy
which
seem
to
have
come
up
with
a
container
that
provide
one
of
the
world
s
fast
java
environment
this
last
option
be
recommend
by
the
application
server
group
s
thomas
kurian
a
young
indian
who
s
a
rise
star
at
oracle
interestingly
there
be
almost
no
not
invent
here
vanity
it
s
a
simple
question
of
what
will
deliver
in
a
cost
effective
and
timely
way
ellison
be
ask
to
approve
the
million
deal
that
have
be
negotiate
with
orion
which
will
preclude
sell
a
similar
license
to
any
of
oracle
s
competitor
the
boy
from
orion
have
also
reluctantly
accepted
that
they
can
t
give
the
program
to
the
open
source
movement
for
three
year
it
s
apparently
the
only
requirement
they
balk
at
ellison
be
not
only
happy
to
cut
the
deal
he
want
it
do
fast
so
he
can
avoid
incur
any
far
parallel
development
cost
he
even
asks
if
there
s
a
danger
of
lowball
orion
with
the
million
it
s
not
altruism
he
want
to
make
sure
that
orion
have
enough
money
not
to
stint
on
development
that
will
benefit
oracle
the
final
question
be
whether
the
application
server
have
be
underpriced
ellison
be
adamant
about
keep
a
performance
price
advantage
over
rival
it
get
people
download
the
software
and
generates
buzz
on
all
the
tech
bulletin
board
keep
the
price
low
this
be
a
recur
theme
even
if
people
steal
your
software
you
get
the
money
back
in
the
end
because
they
re
force
to
buy
your
other
product
and
support
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
week
marketing
executive
stacey
torman
have
some
new

to
show

safra

formidable

up
thanks
to
the

a

that
ellison
proudly
boast
he
s
never
be
to
in
his
life
plenty
of
time
for
ellison
to
mount
a
favorite
hobbyhorse
the
reason
for
this
voyage
of

be
to
announce
a
partnership
with

it

for

it
will

put
in
more

than
it
s
likely
to

in

but
that
s
not
the
reason
ellison
be
so
excite
he
s
be
think
for
some
time
about
how
oracle
and
the

could
transform
the
efficiency
of
the
health

industry
which
be
not
only
the

s
big
he
think
he
s
read
somewhere
that
its

be
about

one
in
which
software

have
yet
to
make
any

once

will
be
beating
a

to
admit
that
while
it
be
the
big
provider
of
clinical
trial
software
it
have
gap
in
its
industry
knowledge
that
need
to
be
fill
and
it
will
also
have
to
adapt
its
software
to
the
particular
need
of
health
care
to
achieve
that
it
s
crucial
to
have
a
commit
anchor
customer
such
as
healthsouth
that
share
its
vision
and
will
work
with
oracle
to
get
the
software
right
that
s
why
it
make
sense
for
oracle
to
do
the
work
for
free
finally
there
be
nearly
a

that

be

say
it
s
a
great
opportunity
to
get
all
of

there
may

some
additional

that
the

up

that
you
want

to
change
the

change
it
yourself
it

the

that

it

of

challenge
say
nussbaum
de
la

throw
in
an
offer
to
be
a
customer
reference
he
suggests
something
along
the
line
of
we
grow
fast
have
the
best
customer
satisfaction
score
and
we
do
it
with
oracle
i
don
t
mind
tell
the

that
you
guy
fix
it
grove
hint
that
the
rest
of

s
consumer
business
might
also
move
to
oracle
if
the
steer
committee
can
come
up
with
a
really
telcocentric
version
of
the
e
business

finally
ellison
suggests
that
they
be
go
to
need

storage
disk
to
mine
all
the

they
will

that

from

for
the
time
be
everybody
be
happy
and
optimistic
ellison
ingratiatingly
concludes
it
s
important
that
our

work
closely
with

the
only

a

good
to

up

critical
to
closing
the

the
dozen
university
president
produce
a
different
atmosphere
from
the
ceo
who
normally
come
to
ellison
s
roundtable
event
they
be
administrator
politician
rather
than
businessmen
with
some
of
the
self
importance
of
the
latter
and
the
stiffness
of
the
former
ellison
with
his
youthful
history
of
not
hang
around
long
enough
to
complete
university
course
seem
slightly
uneasy
and
go
into
contortion
to
affect
a
respect
that
he
almost
certainly
doesn
t
feel
but
high
education
be
potentially
a
huge
market
if
enough
university
can
be
persuade
to
work
with
oracle
both
to
standardize
their
process
and
to
help
oracle
s
developer
adapt
the
e
business
suite
to
their
need
ellison
be
hop
that
these
men
and
with
only
one
exception
they
be
all
men
have
be
sufficiently
chasten
by
try
to
integrate
a
spaghetti
of
specialized
application
from
the
small
software
firm
that
focus
on
the
academic
market
that
they
will
be
receptive
to
his
message
almost
as
soon
as
ellison
draw
breath
from
his
preamble
one
of
the
academic
asks
what
kind
of
deal
they
might
get
from
oracle
he
argues
that
oracle
s
pricing
should
reflect
the
possibility
that
student
introduce
to
the
software
at
their
university
could
become
valuable
customer
in
later
life
ellison
say
that
nussbaum
have
the
authority
to
discount
deeply
but
that
what
tends
to
cost
most
money
in
a
software
implementation
be
the
labor
to
put
it
in
which
can
t
be
discount
our
goal
he
say
be
to
develop
software
that
work
out
of
the
box
so
you
don
t
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
change
it
but
to
achieve
that
we
need
a
much
closer
relationship
with
our
customer
so
that
we
fully
understand
their
business
process
then
we
can
help
you
modernize
those
process
before
we
help
you
automate
them
don
t
pay
us
or
anyone
else
to
adapt
our
software
to
the
way
you
ve
be
do
business
for
the
last
twenty
year
if
you
do
that
you
ll
spend
too
much
money
and
get
too
little
benefit
ellison
go
on
to
say
that
what
he
want
be
to
open
up
a
debate
about
find
standard
way
best
practice
of
do
thing
across
a
number
of
institution
that
way
automation
of
thing
like
student
record
keep
becomes
cheap
and
easy
okay
say
one
of
the
president
with
the
satisfied
air
of
somebody
who
s
about
to
say
something
extremely
smart
but
we
re
go
to
want
our
own
bell
and
whistle
it
s
as
if
he
hasn
t
heard
a
word
that
ellison
have
be
say
for
the
last
forty
five
minute
adroitly
ellison
turn
the
remark
on
its
head
the
question
he
say
be
whether
those
bell
and
whistle
be
innovation
that
will
work
for
other
university
and
become
best
practice
if
they
be
they
should
be
add
to
the
plain
vanilla
product
next
come
the
inevitable
question
about
what
oracle
be
do
to
bridge
the
digital
divide
and
the
equally
predictable
answer
about
all
the
virtuous
thing
that
oracle
be
do
we
be
always
look
for
new
program
that
help
narrow
the
digital
divide
mouth
ellison
piously
suddenly
however
he
have
an
idea
from
what
he
heard
today
he
say
there
s
a
need
to
link
an
individual
s
record
from
different
academic
institution
to
create
a
single
lifetime
learn
record
to
support
accountability
and
validate
credential
oracle
could
create
such
a
database
as
a
public
service
up
till
now
we
ve
be
focus
on
building
software
for
individual
university
but
we
could
build
a
national
student
record
database
and
put
it
on
the
internet
every
university
could
use
the
system
for
free
but
don
t
mistake
this
for
altruism
if
we
create
a
free
student
record
hub
database
it
s
more
likely
that
university
will
purchase
oracle
s
spoke
software
in
fact
most
of
you
might
find
it
more
economical
for
oracle
to
provide
a
national
online
student
record
service
than
each
of
you
have
your
own
student
record
system
he
go
on
we
re
try
to
think
through
the
high
education
market
systematically
we
want
to
make
the
same
commitment
to
education
as
we
ve
make
to
health
care
and
manufacturing
do
we
need
more
domain
expertise
absolutely
but
we
ll
never
know
as
much
about
your
business
as
you
do
we
cannot
finish
the
e
business
suite
for
education
without
your
help
and
we
can
be
successful
only
if
you
re
interested
in
modernize
and
standardize
your
business
process
look
at
our
current
software
as
a
start
point
and
then
help
us
well
understand
what
we
have
to
add
to
meet
your
need
be
there
the
collective
will
to
make
this
work
this
be
not
just
a
pitch
to
sell
software
it
do
the
trick
as
the
lunch
break
up
there
be
a
sudden
rush
for
reassurance
my
most
urgent
need
be
the
student
service
module
if
we
sign
on
be
there
go
to
be
a
commitment
of
resource
to
match
the
urgency
if
i
partner
with
you
will
you
be
there
for
me
ellison
smile
the
exercise
in
humility
be
over
we
be
the
large
enterprise
software
company
in
the

there
be
nobody

us
as
nussbaum

the

favorite
customer
when
it
come
to
promote
the
concept
of
the
e
business
suite
but
mclaughlin
complains
he

prove
a
take
no
prisoner
negotiator
over
financial
issue
he
s
a
great
guy
say
mclaughlin
but
he
seem
to
think
he
shouldn
t
have
to
pay
it
s
kind
of
a
macho
thing
with
him
about
pay
mclaughlin
s
tactic
have
be
to
offer
rice
a
large
discount
as
an
incentive
for
pay
up
front
ellison
tell
him
not
to
worry
and
not
to
offer
any
more
discount
he
say
ge
already
get
a
huge
discount
mclaughlin
be
concerned
about
not
be
able
to
book
the
revenue
for
the
quarter
but
ellison
just
keep
say
that
ge
should
buy
the
software
when
it
need
it
not
before
before
ellison
make
his
speech
some
time
have
be
set
aside
for
a
meeting
with
alcoa
s
ceo
alan
belda
who
s
eager
to
give
ellison
a
progress
report
on
alcoa
s
e
business
suite
implementation
alcoa
with
revenue
of
more
than
billion
a
year
have
operation
in
plant
in
thirty
seven
country
belda
be
use
oracle
software
to
create
something
call
the
alcoa
business
system
ab
an
integrate
enterprise
wide
e
business
system
that
have
be
design
to
bind
the
sprawl
company
together
in
such
close
collaboration
that
it
will
operate
as
if
it
be
a
single
entity
with
the
same
business
rule
share
service
a
common
industrial
language
and
unencumbered
knowledge
transfer
across
division
and
geography
belda
have
commit
to
spending
million
over
the
next
five
year
all
on
oracle
he
s
take
the
whole
suite
of
manufacturing
application
order
management
supply
chain
human
resource
financials
and
manufacturing
at
the
same
time
he
s
set
a
target
of
take
billion
of
annual
cost
out
of
the
company
and
be
expect
information
technology
it
spending
to
fall
to
percent
of
its
level
in
the
meeting
with
belda
be
low
key
but
verge
on
the
mutually
congratulatory
ellison
describes
what
alcoa
be
attempt
as
daunt
but
promise
that
if
oracle
s
own
experience
be
anything
to
go
by
the
benefit
will
be
remarkable
it
seem
that
alcoa
be
do
everything
the
recommend
oracle
way
belda
say
that
for
sixty
day
the
majority
of
his
time
be
spent
with
oracle
work
out
how
key
process
should
be
reengineered
i
m
basically
bet
the
whole
of
my
business
on
you
guy
he
say
what
convince
him
to
go
with
oracle
be
the
promise
speed
at
which
the
integrate
suite
could
be
deployed
there
be
a
big
internal
debate
he
say
between
oracle
and
sap
but
it
be
kinda
rig
kpmg
s
the
consultant
hire
by
alcoa
idea
of
a
fast
sap
rollout
be
to
do
one
location
a
month
at
that
rate
belda
say
i
would
have
be
retire
before
they
be
through
belda
suggests
that
ellison
should
concentrate
his
speech
on
the
lesson
learn
from
oracle
s
e
business
transformation
and
what
he
have
see
at
other
company
go
through
the
same
upheaval
belda
say
that
the
big
challenge
he
face
be
with
people
half
want
to
change
the
other
half
don
t
and
he
s
already
notice
that
he
be
encounter
more
resistance
in
the
united
state
to
the
idea
of
mapping
process
to
the
software
rather
than
do
it
the
other
way
round
it
s
just
like
with
ge
say
ellison
if
they
get
the
process
right
in
hungary
their
houston
plant
shouldn
t
need
any
modification
but
that
doesn
t
take
into
account
the
human
factor
he
say
people
be
willing
to
automate
their
current
process
but
not
change
them
they
think
they
re
already
do
it
the
right
way
big
company
have
to
standardize
their
process
across
all
their
different
location
if
they
want
to
automate
efficiently
that
require
a
lot
of
change
and
a
lot
of
resistance
to
that
change
be
inevitable
now
the
speech
have
a
high
purpose
it
doesn
t
have
to
be
a
sale
pitch
instead
it
have
to
get
the
four
hundred
alcoa
manager
on
whom
the
success
of
oracle
s
software
ultimately
depends
to
become
true
believer
it
s
an
opportunity
for
ellison
to
do
what
he
do
best
inspire
flatter
amuse
and
finally
steamroller
skepticism
with
his
own
massive
certainty
it
s
the
end
of
my
first
week
on
the
road
with
ellison
when
you
be
around
him
you
cannot
escape
be
evangelize
he
can
t
help
it
the
idea
come
bubbling
out
and
he
s
so
excite
about
them
that
he
have
to
share
them
i
have
begin
to
think
that
sell
software
be
a
secondary
objective
for
ellison
what
s
far
more
important
to
him
be
to
recruit
believer

le
writes
actually
i
didn
t
invent
the
idea
for
a
version
of
the
e
business
suite
on
the
fly
during
my
meeting
in
china
the
idea
originate
some
time
before
when
a
team
of
derek
williams
s
engineer
start
a
project
to
preconfigure
the
e
business
suite
for
small
asian
customer
this
special
edition
of
our
business
software
be
now
in
the
market
and
sell
for
less
than
include
installation
le
writes
when
we
implement
our
e
business
suite
at
jds
uniphase
it
be
up
and
run
globally
in
less
than
a
year
we
put
the
system
in
for
a
guaranteed
fix

the
special
edition
of
the
e
business
suite
come
to
the
china
market
in
le
writes
it
have
be
my
experience
that
people
reflexively
resist
change
change
require
people
to
rethink
the
way
they
work
and
the
way
they
be
organize
when
people
write
down
their
current
process
and
the
reason
why
those
process
cannot
be
simplify
it
force
them
to
carefully
and
methodically
rethink
their
business
this
usually
result
in
business
process
be
change
as
oppose
to
our
software
simplify
modernize
business
process
be
at
least
as
important
as
good
business
software
in
deliver
efficiency
to
the
enterprise
when
we
do
turn
up
a
serious
shortcoming
in
our

of
the

go
out
of

an
attack
on

so
complete
customer
could
get
everything
they

from
one
vendor
it

an
attack
on
the

because
ellison

argue
that
glue
together
program
from
different

firm
be
an
expensive
waste
of

it

also
an

straight
feature
contest
between

s
suite
and
most
best
of

assembly
the

come
off

what
do
he

the
overwhelm
reason
ellison
believe
for
the
failure
of
information
technology
to
deliver
on
its
overblown
promise
be
the
fragmentation
of

that
result
from
the

industry
s
addiction
to
complexity
expensively
assemble

system
in
which
the
cost
of

might
be
ten
time
as
much
as
the
original
software
license
be
ellison
s
late
target
but
the
origin
of
his
war
on
complexity
go
back
more
than
a
decade
ellison
start
his
career
as
a
contract
mainframe
programmer
and
although
oracle
have
be
happy
to
join
the
stampede
to
client
server
in
the
late
s
ellison
quickly
become
disillusion
with
it
he
say
we
instal
lot
of
client
server
system
but
it
be
a
very
ugly
model
our
application
be
instal
on
thousand
of
pc
so
if
you
need
to
fix
a
bug
you
d
have
to
change
the
software
on
all
those
thousand
of
pc
it
be
an
incredibly
labor
intensive
expensive
error
prone
nightmare
of
a
process
bad
yet
client
server
work
fine
on
high
speed
ethernet
lan
local
area
network
but
it
perform
terribly
on
slow
wide
area
network
like
the
internet
we
d
take
a
huge
step
backwards
because
of
this
wide
area
network
problem
mainframe
system
have
dumb
terminal
with
a
dumb
user
interface
but
dumb
terminal
work
beautifully
on
wide
area

so
you
could
build
an
airline
reservation
system
on
a

computer
with
a
single
database
that
could
be
access
by

all
over
the
world
but
client
server
system
didn
t
work
on
wide
area

so
you
have
to
use
a
separate

you
do
business
attach

your

hopelessly
fragment
in
the
process
ellison
isn
t
short
of
story
that
exemplify
the
insanity
of
client
server
i
ll
never
forget
when
this
reporter
from
the
wall
street
journal
phone
me
to
get
my
comment
on
a
story
he
be
write
on
grand
met
s
the
international
hotel
and
catering
group
information
strategy
a
few
year
ago
they
decide
that
they
be
go
to
put
a
low
cost
database
server
computer
into
every
burger
king
what
do
you
think
of
that
larry
i
be
stun
all
i
could
say
be
they
re
put
database
in
hamburger
store
what
be
they
crazy
they
shouldn
t
put
a
database
in
every
store
but
they
be
kind
of
stuck
the
only
way
for
them
to
deal
with
client
server
dependence
on
fast
network
be
to
put
a
server
computer
into
every
location
where
they
do
business
that
be
in
every
location
where
they
have
client
pc
and
if
you
think
it
s
hard
to
manage
lot
of
desktop
pc
just
wait
until
you
try
to
manage
a
database
server
in
every
location
where
you
do
business
good
luck
it
s
nearly
impossible
to
manage
all
that
distribute
complexity
plus
you
so
fragment
your
data
you
can
t
keep
track
of
what
s
go
on
in
your
business
but
all
these
client
server
problem
weren
t
obvious
until
you
get
to
the
point
of
try
to
run
a
large
network
of
lot
of
little
database
server
in
different
location
in
contrast
the
advantage
offer
by
pc
client
server
compute
be
immediately
obvious
to
everyone
and
quite
seductive
well
user
interface
cheaper
hardware
easy
program
all
that
make
client
server
seem
irresistible
but
the
inherent
problem
of
the
client
server
model
be
enormous
it
be
a
tick
time
bomb
in
fact
the
bomb
be
tick
inside
ellison
himself
the
day
it
explode
be
september
at
the
annual
conference
in
paris
call
the
european
information
technology
forum
it
be
exactly
eleven
day
since
the
launch
of
window
accompany
by
the
big
marketing
blitz
in
history
bill
gate
s
face
be
everywhere
he
be
fete
not
only
for
be
the
inspiration
behind
the
most
excite
company
in
the
world
but
for
the
powerful
vision
of
the
near
future
that
he
have
articulate
with
the
help
of
microsoft
s
chief
seer
nathan
mhyrvold
in
the
road
ahead
a
book
all
about
the
come
information
superhighway
that
somehow
manage
to
avoid
almost
any
mention
of
the
internet
gate
be
to
be
the
keynote
speaker
at
the
conference
with
ellison
schedule
to
be
the
warm
up
ellison
s
speech
be
rarely
script
predictable
affair
on
this
occasion
the
slide
projector
didn
t
work
so
he
just
start
talk
do
he
know
what
he
be
go
to
say
beforehand
sort
of
but
not
exactly
he
say
what
he
thought
be
important
to
talk
about
that
day
be
the
paradigm
shift
to
the
internet
that
be
come
similar
to
the
shift
from
mainframe
to
client
server
and
to
express
some
dissent
about
the
apotheosis
of
the
microsoft
window
pc
which
have
clearly
take
its
toll
on
ellison
he
say
now
it
be
really
get
on
my
nerve
it
be
just
such
a
surreal
experience
there
be
peace
in
the
middle
east
and
war
in
bosnia
the
same
week
that
window
be
announce
and
all
the
major
network
seem
to
cover
be
people
in
parking
lot
wait
up
all
night
to
get
their
first
copy
of
window
it
be
very
strange
everyone
be
say
that
microsoft
s
pc
centric
client
server
compute
would
take
over
the
world
and
then
go
on
forever
everything
else
would
disappear
unix
be
go
away
mainframe
be
go
away
there
d
be
little
window
computer
everywhere
little
database
server
everywhere
well
we
be
in
the
middle
of
instal
all
these
client
server
system
and
try
to
make
them
work
and
they
didn
t
work
very
well
your
information
be
chopped
into
tiny
piece
store
in
lot
of
tiny
database
run
on
lot
of
tiny
pc
server
computer
this
data
fragmentation
be
accompany
by
distribute
complexity
the
pc
be
already
a
ridiculously
complex
device
and
microsoft
have
plan
to
make
it
still
more
complex
they
be
develop
a
new
more
powerful
operating
system
design
to
run
all
the
increasingly
complex
application
that
be
destine
for
your
desktop
pc
it
be
madness
you
can
t
keep
put
application
on
the
desktop
pc
you
have
to
get
as
many
application
off
the
desktop
and
onto
server
as
possible
and
while
you
re
at
it
most
data
should
be
move
off
pc
and
onto
server
as
well
the
pc
need
to
be
much
simpler
and
more
appliance
like
the
big
idea
in
the
paris
speech
be
that
even
at
the
moment
that
the
pc
s
dominance
seem
beyond
question
the
rise
of
the
internet
be
already
demonstrate
a
superior
model
of
compute
ellison
have
say
when
you
have
a
networkcentric
compute
model
you
don
t
need
a
device
anywhere
near
as
complicate
as
a
personal
computer
you
can
build
a
multimedia
internet
terminal
for
or
compare
to
the
you
need
to
spend
at
the
time
to
get
a
capable
pc
you
just
plug
it
into
the
wall
to
get
power
electron
and
into
the
network
to
get
to
application
and
information
bit
and
you
re
do
the
one
mistake
that
ellison
make
be
in
call
the
new
thin
client
as
oppose
to
the
fat
pc
client
he
have
dream
up
a
network
computer
look
back
he
say
if
i
d
be
really
smart
i
d
have
call
it
an
internet
computer
i
call
it
a
network
computer
partly
because
i
like
sun
s
slogan
the
network
be
the
computer
and
partly
because
the
word
internet
be
not
all
that
well
know
in
more
than
two
and
a
half
year
later
when
oracle
ship
an
internet
version
of
its
previously
client
server
base
release
application
suite
ellison
still
hadn
t
learn
that
particular
lesson
the
reengineered
software
be
christen
nca
the
initial
stand
for
network
compute
architecture
and
no
one
be
listen
ellison
recall
we
have
to
change
the
name
network
compute
architecture
get
absolutely
no
traction
in
the
marketplace
so
we
announce
a
successor
call
internet
compute
architecture
and
sale
take
off
the
big
difference
between
the
two
the
name
the
consequence
of
the
paris
speech
be
profound
although
gate
who
have
follow
ellison
onstage
didn
t
stoop
to
reply
to
the
attack
on
his
beloved
pc
the
medium
have
the
bit
between
their
teeth
ellison
be
suddenly
front
page
news
he
be
actually
not
predict
the
death
of
the
pc
the
pc
like
the
mainframe
wouldn
t
disappear
but
it
would
no
longer
be
at
the
heart
of
the
compute
universe
however
that
be
how
it
look
as
the
story
gather
momentum
in
an
interview
after
the
speech
ellison
enjoy
the
attention
characteristically
add
a
little
fuel
to
the
flame
boldly
forecasting
that
within
ten
year
network
computer
would
have
overtaken
pc
in
sale
the
ensue
publicity
for
oracle
and
ellison
be
beyond
anything
he
have
dare
hope
for
suddenly
he
be
much
more
famous
than
he
would
ever
have
be
as
the
bos
of
a
company
that
sell
arcane
technology
to
business
now
he
be
lock
in
a
theological
struggle
for
the
future
of
compute
with
one
of
the
richest
and
most
recognizable
people
in
the
world
oracle
instead
of
be
bracket
with
other
database
firm
such
as
informix
and
sybase
be
suddenly
be
talk
about
in
the
same
breath
as
mighty
microsoft
it
quickly
become
apparent
that
the
world
want
to
know
what
the
newfangled
network
computer
would
look
like
and
that
oracle
a
software
rather
than
a
hardware
company
would
have
to
find
a
way
of
building
one
mark
jarvis
who
now
run
marketing
at
oracle
recall
microsoft
be
say
no
this
will
never
happen
it
s
a
stupid
idea
so
we
be
actually
confront
with
this
problem
of
have
something
to
show
people
larry
be
a
bit
responsible
for
this
everyone
think
of
the
network
computer
as
a
physical
device
later
on
as
history
now
show
the
pc
sort
of
become
a
network
computer
and
so
do
the
cell
phone
but
back
then
we
have
to
make
something
that
people
could
look
at
the
official
unveil
of
the
network
computer
be
at
oracle
open
world
in
japan
one
of
the
big
computer
show
in
the
world
jarvis
say
we
have
them
under
cloth
at
openworld
larry
unveiled
them
in
front
of
all
these
people
and
they
look
great
flash
flash
flash
there
be
a
medium
frenzy
but
you
know
what
they
be
make
out
of
wood
i
remember
they
cost
a
shitload
to
design
hundred
of
thousand
of
dollar
just
for
a
piece
of
wood
but
everyone
thought
they
be
real
in
time
a
specially
set
up
subsidiary
of
oracle
call
nci

to
build
about
thirty
thousand
of
the

with
the
help
of
some
hardware
partner
one
version
now
call
the
nic
new
internet
computer
struggle
on
today
mainly
as
a
machine
that
oracle
donates
to
school
have
go
so
extremely
public
with
his
revolt
from
the
whole
client
server
model
ellison
could
hardly
allow
his
engineer
just
to
go
on
develop
software
as
if
nothing
have
happen
ellison
have
spell
out
his
view
that
client
server
be
an
evolutionary
dead
end
and
that
a
form
of
servercentric
compute
base
on
the
open
standard
and
protocol
of
the
internet
be
the
future
for
oracle
however
get
oracle
to
change
direction
be
not
just
a
question
of
articulate
a
new
strategy
and
expect
people
to
get
on
with
it
the
effort
of
the
entire
company
from
the
developer
building
the
application
to
the
sale
and
consult
team
who
be
sell
and
instal
the
software
be
dedicate
to
make
client
server
a
success
it
be
what
customer
expect
and
demand
whatever
ellison
might
be
say
about
the
network
computer
and
a
new
form
of
compute
base
on
the
internet
client
server
be
quite
simply
the
environment
as
for
ellison
it
be
as
if
he
have
need
the
speech
and
the
reaction
to
it
to
create
a
new
set
of
circumstance
a
new
reality
that
would
force
him
to
lead
the
charge
toward
internet
compute
whatever
that
would
turn
out
to
be
despite
the
skepticism
of
many
of
his
follower
much
later
he
say
to
me
once
i
m
finally
certain
of
the
right
direction
i
pick
a
fight
as
i
do
with
gate
it
help
me
make
my
point
and
it
make
it
impossible
to
do
an
about
face
and
go
back
once
a
course
have
be
plot
i
sail
a
long
way
off
and
burn
my
boat
it
s
win
or
die
how
quick
be
ellison
to
understand
the
significance
of
the
internet
compare
with
others
in
the
compute
industry
there
be
undoubtedly
others
who
saw
the
light
even
earlier
but
he
get
there
pretty
fast
farzad

remembers
go
out

with

him
kind
of

on
what
you
could
do
with
this
stuff
mark

recall
a
meeting
at
oracle
in
february
to
tell
ellison
about
some
software
that
a
development
team
have
come
up
with
to
allow
access
to

of

that

of

quickly

as

right
from
the

he
believe
that
the

really
do

six

he

i
know
it
sound
a

with

adopt

the

the

struggle
to
make

the
first
big
software
company
to
get
to
the

be
for
another
chapter
but
the
philosophy
of
compute
that
trigger
ellison
s
outburst
against
the
pc
and
the
subsequent
long
and
at
time
bloody
campaign
to
end
the
dominion
of
client
server
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
one
that
have
lead
him
to
his
current
battle
with
best
of
breed
software
vendor
and
powerful
system
integrator
namely
that
the
cardinal
sin
of
the
compute
industry
be
the
creation
of
complexity
a
complexity
that
invariably
result
in
information
system
that
don
t
deliver
timely
and
useful
information
because
they
use
software
architecture
that
result
in
chronic
fragmentation
of
data
although
oracle
first
become
active
in
the
business
application
market
in
the
late
s
ellison
s
own
involvement
in
their
development
be
at
best
sporadic
until
well
after
his
internet
epiphany
but
when
in
early
he
be
push
into
take
a
more
active
role
a
number
of
thing
soon
struck
him
as
odd
the
first
be
that
there
be
no
consistent
view
of
oracle
s
application
among
its
customer
whereas
by
this
time
just
about
all
oracle
s
database
customer
be
get
a
product
that
either
met
or
exceed
their
expectation
the
same
be
not
true
of
the
people
who
be
buying
its
application
ellison
say
some
customer
love
our
application
some
didn
t
that
seem
very
odd
to
me
how
could
customer
react
so
differently
to
the
same
product
my
question
reveal
my
fundamental
misunderstand
of
our
application
business
every
application
customer
didn
t
use
the
same
product
the
application
business
be
not
like
our
database
business
we
finish
our
database
software
and
then
you
use
it
but
with
our
application
software
the
customer
usually
assist
by
a
team
of
consultant
make
major
change
to
our
software
before
it
s
use
sometimes
the
change
work
sometimes
not
no
wonder
customer
satisfaction
varied
so
widely
the
business
model
of
the
customer
finish
our
software
for
us
seem
flaw
to
me
but
that
s
the
way
oracle
s
application
business
work
that
s
the
way
sap
s
application
business
work
in
fact
that
s
how
the
entire
enterprise
application
software
industry
work
what
ellison
meant
by
the
software
not
be
finish
be
oracle
do
not
sell
a
complete
range
of
application
the
chance
be
that
anyone
buying
say
oracle
s
financial
and
manufacturing
software
would
need
to
add
the
product
of
perhaps
three
or
four
other
company
to
get
the
computer
system
they
need
and
the
job
of
knit
these
different
program
together
that
have
never
be
design
to
work
with
each
other
be
the
job
of
either
their
own
it
people
or
highly
paid
consultant
ellison
say
the
application
software
industry
sell
component
not
complete
business
system
the
customer
bought
the
component
and
assemble
them
into
system
as
best
they
could
no
instruction
include
no
other
technology
industry
in
the
world
work
this
way
i

every

the

you
don

a

who
in

why
do
people
use
heavily
customize
one
of
a
kind
business
system
because
they
have
no

we
want
to
give

a
choice
of
a
complete

of

application
if
the
lack
of

be
one
reason
why
customer
modify

software
from

and
other

another
be
that
it
have
become

to

half
of

put
it
when
most
of
us
buy
a
car
we
select
a
standard
design
and
then
choose
from
a
standard
set
of
option
think
for
a
moment
about
what
that
have
meant
for
the
evolution
of
the
automobile
every
brand
have
be
able
to

the

rework
every

to
the

s
preconception
about
how

the
convention
with

have
be
for
company
to
buy
standard
product
and
then
pay
somebody
to
change

so
that
they

to

either
an

who

who

ellison
become
convince
that
the
peculiar
characteristic
of

the
need
to
glue
together
a

for

often
fail
to
deliver
the
expect
return
on
very
large
investment
for
ellison
as
always
the
most
pernicious
consequence
of
unnecessary
complexity
be
the
result
fragmentation
of

in
the
era
of

with

could
not

the

out
it

a
necessary
evil
multiple

however
the
advent
of

meant
at

in
theory
that
it
be
now
possible
for
any
company
however
big
and
complicate
to
move

just
one
central

with
reconcile
and
integrate

data
that
could
be

from
anywhere
in

that
wasn

say
the

a

all

no

ellison
described
system
integration
as
the
gift
that
keep
on
give
or
that
in
may
ibm
s
then
ceo
lou
gerstner
be
able
to
boast
at
analyst
day
that
for
every
dollar
spent
on
software
license
up
to
seven
be
spent
on
service
ellison
s
analysis
be
inform
by
what
he
d
encounter
at
oracle
although
oracle
be
use
only
its
own
application
before
the
advent
of
the
e
business
suite
they
be
scarcely
more
integrate
than
many
best
of
breed
system
whenever
ellison
meet
customer
he
describes
what
it
be
like
here
i
be
run
the
company
that
provide
most
of
the
world
s
information
management
software
and
our
internal
application
system
couldn
t
provide
answer
to
the
most
basic
business
question
like
how
many
people
work
at
oracle
today
i
didn
t
know
why
well
the
french
have
their
own
hr
human
resource
system
and
database
the
german
have
their
own
hr
system
and
database
so
do
the
japanese
and
the
american
and
the
canadian
etc
in
total
we
have
seventy
separate
hr
system
to
find
out
how
many
people
work
at
oracle
worldwide
i
d
have
to
inquire
into
all
seventy
hr
system
all
our
business
data
be
fragment
into
so
many
separate
database
it
be
difficult
to
get
answer
to
many
seemingly
simple
question
how
much
do
we
sell
yesterday
sorry
our
sale
order
data
be
fragment
across
a
hundred
and
thirty
separate
accounting
database
one
per
country
in
which
we
do
business
how
many
new
customer
do
we
get
last
month
simply
impossible
to
answer
our
customer
data
be
fragment
into
four
hundred
separate
customer
database
bad
still
it
be
just
about
impossible
to
combine
the
customer
data
into
a
data
warehouse
because
the
customer
data
be
not
consistent
across
all
those
separate
operational
database
for
example
the
same
customer
michelin
would
have
one
customer
id
number
in
the
french
database
and
a
different
customer
id
number
in
the
german
database
in
the
data
warehouse
one
customer
michelin
thus
look
like
several
separate
customer
no
wonder
people
have
a
hard
time
get
information
out
of
their
business
system
the
current
state
of
the
art
be
inconsistent
information
fragment
across
lot
of
little
database
and
integrate
and
maintain
all
these
separate
little
system
cost
much
more
than
a
single
unified
set
of
application
run
on
a
single
global
database
so
business
be
pay
extra
not
to
be
able
to
get
answer
to
their
question
but
it
s
bad
than
that
if
your
system
can
t
easily
share
information
then
the
people
within
your
company
can
t
communicate
effectively
if
they
can
t
communicate
they
can
t
cooperate
this
result
in
a
lot
of
friction
between
group
marketing
doesn
t
cooperate
very
well
with
sale
france
doesn
t
cooperate
very
well
with
germany
sound
familiar
what
be
unbelievably
frustrate
be
the
fact
that
we
be
pay
top
dollar
to
maintain
this
mess
all
these
separate
system
with
their
fragment
inconsistent
data
we
have
a
huge
it
staff
run
hundred
of
loosely
connect
system
we
want
one
unified
system
with
one
global
database
with
all
our
information
in
one
place
we
could
easily
access
and
share
information
we
d
make
well
decision
group
would
cooperate
and
it
cost
would
go
down
all
that
would
happen
but
first
we
d
have
to
build
a
global
application
system
that
s
why
we
built
the
e
business
suite
the
high
cost
of
implement
and
run
these
system
the
fragmentation
of
data
that
result
in
very
little
useful
information
be
available
in
real
time
ellison
described
them
as
billion
dollar
clerical
automation
system
and
the
near
impossibility
of
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
upgrade
gracefully
be
not
the
only
thing
that
customer
be
unhappy
about
one
obvious
one
be
the
vendor
refusal
to
take
responsibility
for
the

of

ellison
believe
that

of

software
solution
in
which
every

have
to
sit
on
its

have
to
be
move
laboriously
and
usually
in
incomplete
form
from
one
database
to
another
through
a
custom
design
integration
layer
would
always
struggle
to
achieve
the
seamlessness
and
speed
implicit
in

promise
the
answer
to
the

that

application
customer
be

ellison
conclude
lay
in
do
two
thing
which
he
calculate
that
oracle
alone
be
capable
of
the
first
be
for
all
of
oracle
s
application
to
be
tightly
integrate
both
with
one
another
and
with
the
database
through
an
architecture
base
on
a
single
share
data
model
the
second
be
to
produce
the
first
ever
complete
suite
of

that
would
be
capable
of
automate
every
aspect
of
a

s
business
from
the
traditional
erp
or
back
office
task
such
as
financials
manufacturing

to
the

relationship
management
sale
marketing
and
customer
support
the
supply
chain
procurement
and

ellison
calculate
that
oracle
s
advantage
lay
both
in
its
gene
as
a
database
company
and
in
the
sheer
size
of
its
development
team
the
start
point
be
to
see
the
database
as
the
hub
and
the
application
as
the
spoke
ellison
say
we
have
be
think
about
the
problem
upside
down
and
as
a
result
we
be
building
the
wrong
software
we
have
be
building
process
automation
system
we
need
to
build
information
system
with
the
process
automation
layer
on
top
traditional
application
design
focus
on
automate
one
particular
process
like
take
an
order
modern
application
design
must
focus
on
one
piece
of
information
customer
order
and
then
layer
on
all
process
that
touch
the
order
information
take
the
order
billing
the
customer
initiate
customer
service
marketing
additional
service
to
that
customer
and
so
on
it
s
not
the
process
at
the
center
it
s
the
data
it
s
the
information
age
if
you
re
building
a
marketing
system
the
marketing
application
should
use
the
same
exact
customer
information
as
your
sale
system
as
your
accounting
system
as
your
customer
service
system
that
way
every
time
you
interact
with
a
customer
it
change
the
same
central
customer
database
all
your
customer
information
be
in
one
place
all
your
product
information
s
in
one
place
all
your
application
share
the
same
data
if
you
draw
a
picture
of
oracle
s
application
architecture
the
database
be
at
the
center
and
the
application
be
attach
around
the
periphery
this
be
a
radically
different
view
of
the
world
if
you
draw
a
picture
of
siebel
s
crm
suite
they
have
a
bunch
of
separate
application
each
with
its
own
separate
database
it
look
like
a
charm
bracelet
but
there
s
no
charm
in
lot
of
separate
database
a
single
global
database
connect
to
a
single
global
network
the
internet
be
the
ideal
architecture
what
follow
be
that
oracle
s
developer
have
to
rewrite
every
erp
and
crm
application
so
that
they
could
all
use
a
common
data
model
that
meant
overcome
the
resistance
of
development
team
who
be
convince
of
the
design
superiority
of
their
particular
model
it
also
meant
fix
on
a
data
model
that
would
be
consistent
across
an
entire
range
of
interaction
for
example
what
be
a
customer
be
it
someone
that
just
buy
stuff
from
us
be
it
someone
that
buy
our
stuff
through
other
channel
be
it
someone
we
ship
stuff
to
or
who
pay
us
for
stuff
we
ship
or
be
it
someone
who
asks
question
before
buying
stuff
or
after
buying
stuff
and
do
that
someone
expect
to
get
service
a
far
problem
be
the
inclusion
into
the
data
model
of
what
be
know
as
multis
language
place
currency
contact
address
and
so
it
go
on
if
ellison
s
concept
of
a
unified
data
model
for
all
of
oracle
s
application
be
vital
to
wag
war
against
complexity
achieve
it
would
be
a
far
from
simple
undertaking
almost
as
important
as
the
datacentric
approach
that
ellison
evangelize
be
the
notion
of
completeness
it
can
t
be
simple
if
it
s
not
complete
have
become
ellison
s
late
mantra
although
rival
immediately
deride
the
idea
that
any
one
company
even
one
as
big
and
financially
strong
as
oracle
could
do
it
all
ellison
do
have
software
history
on
his
side
he
be
only
too
happy
to
point
out
that
he
be
only

swept
nearly
all
before
it
include
less
comprehensive
offering
from
oracle
in
the
s
for
ellison
the
central
argument
in
favor
of
the
suite
approach
be
that
it
would
give
customer
all
the
functionality
they

even

it
sound

ellison

about
ten
million
dollar

employ
about
fifty

what
motivate
me
be
the
desire

argonne
national
laboratory
as
a
contract
programmer
as
part
of
a
physic
course
he
have
to
learn
basic
program
i
just
read
the
book
it
be
similar
to
do
math
proof
it
be
logical
and
i
be
good
at
logic
he
quickly
learn
how
to
program
the
late
ibm
mainframe
computer
i
start
do
contract
program
my
short
attention
span
didn
t
work
against
me
because
i
could
get
program
write
very
quickly
i
end
up
make
quite
a
lot
of
money
and
i
only
have
to
work
a
few
day
a
week
it
be
fun
and
it
be
easy
and
nobody
care
if
you
be
a
ph
d
from
mit
or
have
never
finish
high
school
either
you
could
do
the
job
or
you
couldn
t
i
love
that
for
ellison
discover
he
be
good
at
program
be
both
a
validation
of
his
intelligence
and
liberation
from
what
he
regard
as
absurd
convention
he
say
people
teacher
coach
boss
want
you
to
conform
to
some
standard
of
behavior
they
deem
correct
they
measure
and
reward
you
on
how
well
you
conform
arrive
on
time
dress
appropriately
exhibit
a
properly
deferential
attitude
as
oppose
to
how
well
you
do
your
job
program
liberate
me
from
all
that
i
could
work
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
could
wear
blue
jean
and
a
t
shirt
i
could
ride
my
motorcycle
to
work
and
i
d
make
more
money
if
i
could
solve
the
problem
faster
and
well
than
anyone
else
with
the
money
ellison
be
now
earn
and
skill
that
he
knew
would
be
in
demand
he
bought
a
secondhand
ford
thunderbird
and
head
for
berkeley
california
it
be
the
summer
of
and
it
seem
like
the
place
to
be
be
he
look
for
a
career
not
exactly
basically
program
give
me
the
freedom
to
screw
around
through
my
twenty
all
i
knew
i
be
capable
of
be
short
burst
of
energy
so
i
found
job
work
on
weekend
as
an
ibm
system
programmer
i
would
help
run
these
huge
data
center
and
fix
the
operating
system
on
big
ibm
mainframe
most
people
didn
t
want
to
work
weekend
so
i
have
no
trouble
get
these
job
monday
through
friday
i
d
be
hike
or
rock
climb
in
yosemite
kayak
down
the
stanislaus
or
american
river
or
on
a
long
bike
trip
down
the
california
coast
i
be
in
my
twenty
and
have
fun
soon
after
move
to
berkeley
he
met
and
married
adda
quinn
but
the
marriage
didn
t
last
she
be
very
bright
and
very
pretty
but
although
we
be
the
same
age
she
be
mature
and
i
be
not
the
breakup
trigger
all
sort
of
feeling
of
self
doubt
in
ellison
my
father
have
told
me
that
i
would
never
amount
to
anything
and
now
it
seem
he
might
be
right
i
knew
i
could
earn
a
living
as
a
programmer
but
where
be
my
life
go
i
wonder
if
i
could
ever
be
discipline
enough
to
be
anything
more
than
a
technology
pieceworker
despite
the
soul
search
ellison
continued
to
live
pretty
much
as
before
do
less
contract
work
but
flit
from
one
silicon
valley
firm
to
another
amdahl
a
would
be
competitor
to
ibm
in
mainframe
computer
laid
him
off
in
he
then
go
to
work
for
ampex
the
company
that
have
invent
the
magnetic
tape
recorder
be
work
on
a
way
of
dramatically
increase
the
amount
of
information
that
could
be
store
in
computer
database
the
ampex
terabit
memory
system
be
accord
to
ellison
a
very
cool
project
that
the
cia
have
fund
and
code
name
oracle
at
ampex
ellison
also
met
his
future
partner
bob
miner
and
ed
oates
but
as
usual
ellison
didn
t
stick
around
for
long
by
he
have
move
to
a
firm
call
precision
instrument
soon
to
change
its
name
to
omex
that
like
ampex
be
also
work
on
a
mass
storage
system
the
difference
be
that
for
the
first
time
ellison
have
a
title
vice
president
of
r
and
d
and
some
seniority
i
have
always
believe
that
at
the
top
of
these
company
there
must
be
some
exceptionally
capable
people
who
make
the
entire
technology
industry
work
now
here
i
be
work
near
the
top
of
a
tech
company
and
those
capable
people
be
nowhere
to
be
found
the
senior
manager
i
saw
be
conformist
bureaucratic
and
very
reluctant
to
make
decision
much
to
my
surprise
i
gradually
become
convince
that
i
be
well
at
solve
problem
and
make
decision
than
they
be
or
at
the
very
least
i
be
willing
to
make
a
decision
to
do
something
while
they
seem
paralyze
by
endless
analysis
and
fear
of
make
the
wrong
decision
ellison
suddenly
begin
to
think
that
maybe
he
could
run
a
company
but
he
wasn
t
motivate
by
either
great
ambition
or
the
vision
to
do
anything
in
particular
have
his
own
company
would
simply
allow
him
to
go
on
with
his
life
but
with
more
control
over
it
and
with
well
reward
i
thought
that
if
i
ran
a
small
consult
company
i
could
work
on
a
lot
of
interest
project
and
make
more
money
the
key
be
find
enough
project
that
be
hard
enough
the
ideal
hard
job
be
one
that
be
generally
perceive
as
be
difficult
but
can
quickly
succumb
to
a
bit
of
cleverness
all
we
need
be
a
few
really
smart
people
who
could
do
these
so
call
hard
job
quickly
and
we
would
make
a
lot
of
money
while
not
work
all
that
hard
that
have
be
my
favorite
approach
to
work
from
the
begin
the
job
at
omex
give
him
his
opportunity
omex
be
prepare
to
put
the
contract
for
write
the
software
for
its
mass
storage
system
out
for
bidding
i
say
i
knew
some
super
programmer
who
could
save
the
company
a
lot
of
time
and
money
do
you
want
to
me
to
ask
them
to
put
together
a
bid
on
the
contract
my
bos
the
ceo
say
sure
the
team
that
ellison
have
in
mind
include
two
of
his
former
colleague
from
ampex
oates
and
miner
the
three
of
them
form
a
company
software
development
laboratory
and
they
won
the
contract
from
omex
with
a
bid
of
a
third
the
price
of
the
next
low
bidder
ellison
would
stay
at
omex
to
design
and
oversee
the
project
while
miner
and
oates
write
the
software
with
the
help
of
a
hotshot
young
programmer
name
bruce
scott
when
it
come
to
negotiate
the
ownership
of
sdl
ellison
say
initially
i
propose
splitting
the
company
evenly
between
bob
ed
and
me
then
i
go
home
and
thought
about
it
the
company
have
be
my
idea
and
so
far
i
have
do
all
the
work
so
i
change
my
proposal
i
want
sixty
percent
while
bob
and
ed
would
get
twenty
percent
each
we
agree
that
this
division
of
ownership
be
just
a
start
point
and
that
both
bob
and
ed
could
earn
additional
stock
so
long
as
they
perform
well
bob
do
a
great
job
and
his
ownership
percentage
be
increase
to
thirty
percent
ed
go
through
a
very
messy
divorce
which
affected
his
performance
and
he
end
up
leave
the
company
eventually
ed
return
but
his
ownership
be
reduce
over
the
year
as
oracle
grow
go
public
and
become
a
blue
chip
stock
held
by
many
institution
ellison
s
share
have
inevitably
be
dilute
but
he
have
always
be
acutely
aware
of
the
value
of
his
stock
both
in
financial
term
and
because
of
the
power
it
give
him
within
the
company
alongside
do
the
work
they
be
do
for
omex
the
sdl
partner
with
ellison
at
last
instal
as
president
begin
think
about
what
sort
of
company
they
want
it
to
be
for
ellison
it
seem
obvious
he
say
i
want
to
get
out
of
the
consult
business
consult
prove
to
be
much
more
work
than
i
ever
imagine
my
hard
problem
cleverly
solve
business
model
do
not
scale
up
beyond
a
few
people
prove
i
be
not
nearly
as
clever
as
i
thought
i
be
work
eighty
hour
a
week
at
least
we
be
make
a
lot
of
money
but
we
be
work
insanely
long
hour
the
closest
i
get
to
yosemite
be
the
ansel
adam
poster
on
my
office
wall
so
we
decide
to
abandon
the
consult
business
and
go
into
the
software
product
business
a
software
product
offer
the
ultimate
leverage
build
it
once
and
sell
it
over
and
over
again
the
problem
be
decide
what
it
be
they
would
make
ellison
say
when
i
be
work
for
bob
miner
at
ampex
i
built
a
database
management
system
for
the
pdp
minicomputer
it
be
a
codasyl
database
basically
a
ripoff
excuse
me
model
after
cullinet
s
successful
idms
mainframe
database
cullinet
have
be
quite
successful
compete
against
ibm
in
the
mainframe
database
business
surely
there
be
a
market
for
minicomputer
database
as
well
the
sdl
guy
scour
the
technical
literature
about
database
for
new
idea
ellison
say
the
first
time
i
heard
about
a
relational
database
be
some
year
back
at
a
meeting
with
the
cia
since
then
i
have
read
a
series
of
technical
paper
by
edgar
ted
codd
an
ibm
fellow
about
relational
database
theory
but
codd
s
paper
be
much
too
theoretical
to
be
use
as
the
basis
for
a
product
then
ibm
research
start
publishing
this
series
of
paper
by
don
chamberlain
about
a
prototype
relational
database
they
be
building
call
system
r
include
a
complete
specification
for
system
r
s
structure
query
language
or
sql
after
a
lot
of
careful
reading
and
reread
of
the
system
r
paper
i
decide
we
should
throw
out
the
work
i
have
do
on
the
codasyl
database
and
use
the
ibm
paper
as
an
architectural
blueprint
for
our
new
database
product
the
opportunity
be
huge
we
have
a
chance
to
build
the
world
s
first
commercial
relational
database
why
because
nobody
else
be
even
try
the
other
relational
database
project
be
pure
research
effort
they
be
spending
little
to
no
time
on
overall
system
performance
and
reliability
both
of
which
be
essential
for
a
successful
commercial
database
product
if
we
could
build
a
fast
and
reliable
relational
database
we
would
have
it
make
at
the
same
time
i
thought
it
would
be
smart
to
avoid
the
very
competitive
and
highly
conservative
ibm
mainframe
market
so
we
decide
to
build
our
database
for
the
minicomputer
market
bob
thought
that
the
relational
database
strategy
be
risky
but
he
left
the
final
decision
up
to
me
i
thought
that
relational
be
clearly
the
way
to
go
it
be
very
cool
technology
and
i
like
the
fact
it
be
risky
the
big
the
apparent
risk
the
few
people
will
try
to
go
there
we
would
surely
lose
if
we
have
to
face
serious
competition
but
if
we
be
all
alone
in
pursuit
of
our
goal
of
building
the
first
commercial
relational
database
system
we
have
a
chance
to
win
but
we
have
to
be
first
to
market
with
the
new
technology
this
be
the
first
in
a
pattern
of
apparently
high
risk
decision
i
make
throughout
my
life
at
oracle
but
i
only
ever
picked
the
high
risk
approach
when
i
thought
that
it
would
increase
our
chance
of
win
and
our
share
of
reward
in
the
relational
model
information
in
the
database

as
a

of

of

each

not

relational
database
it
could
be
use
not
only
for
query
but
also
for
data
manipulation
data
definition
and
the
set
of
access
or
privilege
for
group
of
user
no
wonder
ellison
thought
it
be
cool
technology
give
that
ibm
be
do
most
of
the
important
work
in
the
relational
area
apart
from
the
cia
fund
ingres
project
at
berkeley
under
mike
stonebraker
what
make
ellison
think
that
he
and
his
tiny
team
could
come
up
with
a
commercially
viable
product
before
anyone
else
first
conventional
wisdom
have
it
that
relational
database
couldn
t
be
make
to
run
fast
enough
to
be
commercially
viable
so
people
didn
t
enter
the
race
second
ibm
fear
that
introduce
a
relational
database
would
destabilize
its
large
exist
ims
information
management
system
database
business
third
even
if
ibm
do
deliver
a
relational
product
it
would
probably
be
for
mainframe
since
we
be
target
the
minicomputer
market
we
didn
t
need
to
worry
about
ibm
at
least
not
in
the
begin
when
we
be
most
vulnerable
the
money
that
be
come
in
from
omex
basically
paid
for
sdl
to
create
a
first
version
of
what
would
become
the
oracle
database
this
prototype
didn
t
really
work
but
sdl
be
create
intellectual
property
for
itself
change
from
be
a
consult
firm
into
a
software
company
at
a
time
when
there
be
still
very
few
pure
software
company
around
as
oppose
to
hardware
company
that
write
the
code
to
run
their
box
when
ellison
look
around
boston
base
cullinet
with
its
market
value
of
around
million
seem
like
the
company
to
emulate
cullinet
be
our
role
model
we
never
thought
we
could
get
as
big
as
they
be
because
they
have
an
expensive
mainframe
product
and
we
be
focus
on
these
cheap
little
minicomputer
after
complete
the
work
for
omex
do
just
enough
to
get
paid
for
its
software
despite
the
fact
that
the
firm
s
thin
film
laser
storage
hardware
still
didn
t
really
work
sdl
change
its
name
to
relational
software
inc
or
rsi
and
move
into
some
smart
new
office
at
sand
hill
road
near
palo
alto
the
address
of
the
top
venture
capital
firm
in
the
valley
rsi
s
first
customer
turn
out
to
be
the
cia
the
cia
have
be
interested
in
the
relational
model
ever
since
codd
have
first
expound
his
theory
and
have
avidly
follow
the
work
ibm
s
system
r
research
group
have
do
to
make
sql
into
a
key
to
unlock
information
from
a
database
that
could
be
use
by
any
half
competent
user
unfortunately
ibm
wasn
t
yet
interested
in
make
anything
that
might
undermine
ims
so
the
cia
have
to
find
somebody
who
might
be
interested
in
come
up
with
a
commercial
project
dave
robert
the
man
whose
job
it
be
to
find
a
potential
vendor
soon
tracked
down
rsi
two
thing
that
encourage
him
to
bet
the
agency
s
money
on
the
tiny
firm
be
the
discovery
that
bob
miner
who
have
work
with
him
on
the
ampex
terabit
memory
project
be
involve
and
that
rsi
be
commit
to
sql
and
therefore
have
ibm
s
stamp
of
credibility
the
other
thing
that
appeal
to
the
cia
be
that
rsi
be
building
its
database
to
run
on
the
pdp
minicomputer
ellison
say
digital
s
pdp
minicomputer
be
heavily
use
in
government
especially
within
the
intelligence
community
because
the
computer
be
small
enough
to
fit
into
airplane
and
submarine
the
money
that
come
from
the
cia
enable
rsi
to
finish
work
on
the
first
commercial
release
of
the
oracle
database
ellison
recall
that
the
moment
it
actually
work
brought
the
kind
of
thrill
the
wright
brother
must
have
have
when
their
plane
take
to
the
air
the
first
version
of
our
database
be
call
oracle
version
i
didn
t
think
anyone
not
even
the
government
would
buy
version
of
a
database
from
five
guy
in
california
unfortunately
the
version
label
didn
t
change
the
fact
that
we
be
experience
those
very
serious
performance
problem
predict
by
conventional
wisdom
we
just
couldn
t
make
our
database
go
fast
enough
we
try
one
thing
after
another
finally
we
get
a
breakthrough
that
deliver
the
tenfold
performance
improvement
we
need
for
commercial
viability
in
our
final
test
we
ran
faster
than
the
codasyl
system
which
be
then
consider
the
fast
pdp
database
i
be
stun
by
the
final
test
result
i
have
never
thought
about
the
consequence
of
fail
but
i
have
never
thought
about
the
consequence
of
succeed
either
on
my
way
out
that
even
i
ran
into
tony
spoor
our
auditor
in
the
elevator
lobby
i
be
a
bit
light
head
and
euphoric
still
try
to
fully
grasp
the
import
of
our
performance
test
result
i
spontaneously
decide
to
explain
what
it
all
meant
after
laboriously
rattle
off
the
detail
of
our
performance
test
result
i
say
tony
do
you
know
what
this
mean
do
you
do
you
know
what
this
mean
he
say
ugh
no
i
say
that
it
mean
oracle
s
worth
at
least
million
tony
s
lip
part
slowly
and
his
jaw
lower
he
do
not
respond
but
his
look
say
it
all
he
thought
that
after
all
the
late
night
and
weekend
my
mind
have
finally
snap
like
a
dry
twig
this
hundred
million
dollar
valuation
i
just
proclaim
seem
so
far
from
reality
that
he
thought
i
should
be
sedate
and
put
into
a
pad
cell
so
i
wouldn
t
hurt
myself
ellison
add
it
gradually
dawn
on
me
that
this
thing
be
go
to
take
on
a
life
of
its
own
not
because
we
be
go
to
grow
to
be
a
big
company
i
think
we
all
have
the
fantasy
that
however
successful
our
database
product
there
would
never
be
more
than
fifty
of
us
and
customer
would
be
send
us
check
and
we
d
be
send
them
software
even
with
just
fifty
people
on
board
i
thought
that
my
management
ability
would
be
stretch
to
the
limit
i
remember
when
we
hire
our
first
salesman
bob
preger
who
come
from
a
mainframe
database
company
call
software
ag
bob
miner
come
in
and
ask
me
what
do
we
need
a
sale
guy
for
i
smugly
reply
to
sell
more
of
our
software
perhaps
that
s
an
inside
glimpse
of
our
top
management
team
at
work
discuss
the
expansion
of
our
distribution
capacity
i
knew
we
need
to
build
a
sale
organization
although
i
certainly
have
no
idea
how
one
work
bob
however
remain
unconvinced
as
to
the
need
for
salesperson
he
just
say
okay
we
ll
try
one
the
only
way
to
convince
people
that
rsi
have
a
product
that
work
albeit
accord
to
ellison
not
all
that
well
be
to
demo
the
new
database
system
to
anyone
who
could
imagine
a
use
for
it
ellison
have
to
hit
the
road
and
sell
the
news
about
our
hot
little
database
travel
around
the
intelligence
community
pretty
quickly
i
d
make
a
presentation
at
one
agency
on
monday
which
would
result
in
a
phone
call
on
tuesday
to
visit
another
agency
on
wednesday
one
week
i
flew
to
and
from
washington
d
c
three
time
in
a
little
over
six
month
time
we
have
won
several
deal
the
cia
navy
intelligence
air
force
intelligence
and
the
nsa
the
highly
secretive
national
security
agency
but
as
so
often
happens
with
young
company
just
at
the
moment
that
thing
appear
to
be
take
off
rsi
come
perilously
close
to
run
out
of
cash
once
we
start
make
database
sale
we
decide
to
stop
do
consult
work
we
need
everyone
work
on
finish
the
bloody
product
so
the
consult
money
stop
come
in
all
we
have
be
in
the
bank
and
that
didn
t
go
very
far
even
in
those
day
but
the
real
killer
be
that
i
didn
t
have
the
slightest
idea
about
how
much
time
could
elapse
from
the
moment
the
government
say
they
re
go
to
buy
and
the
moment
you
get
the
cash
i
thought
we
d
have
our
money
in
sixty
day
max
not
even
close
when
the
government
want
to
buy
anything
they
have
to
adhere
to
a
congressionally
mandate
process
which
include
the
publication
of
the
pending
purchase
in
the
commerce
business
daily
so
other
firm
can
offer
a
competitive
bid
or
protest
the
purchase
so
after
you
re
told
you
ve
won
the
deal
it
can
still
take
six
to
nine
month
before
you
actually
get
paid
no
consult
money
be
come
in
so
we
be
go
to
run
out
of
cash
the
solution
be
simple
we
have
to
stop
pay
some
people
start
with
me

far
from
find
run
his
own
company
liberate
ellison
be
work
harder
than
he
d
ever
imagine
to
the
extent
that
it
probably
contribute
to
the
breakdown
of
his
second
marriage
to
nancy
wheeler
a
grad
student
at
stanford
after
only
eighteen
month
self
absorption
will
crush
a
young
marriage
and
i
be
completely
absorbed
by
my
own
ambition
i
be
totally
immerse
in
make
the
business
succeed
i
neglect
everything
else
i
be
write
computer
program
write
documentation
answer
customer
support
call
give
training
class
and
send
out
marketing
literature
the
very
last
thing
i
would
do
every
even
be
stamp
a
stack
of
manila
envelope
stuffed
with
this
spiral
bound
oracle
introductory
manual
i
d
write
everyone
and
anyone
i
spoke
with
on
the
phone
that
day
would
get
one
i
d
arrive
home
around
midnight
most
evening
nancy
eventually
tire
of
this
routine
and
left
she
be
the
second
wife
i
manage
to
drive
away
the
first
left
because
i
refuse
to
work
enough
the
second
left
because
i
work
too
much
both
case
be
cause
by
my
self
indulgent
without
compromise
mode
of
living
my
personal
life
have
fall
apart
and
work
be
the
only
thing
left
that
matter
so
i
work
even
more
until
the
hour
of
the
day
ran
out
the
long
hour
be
put
in
at
rsi
be
notice
by
another
occupant
of
the
building
don
lucas
a
doyen
of
the
valley
venture
capital
community
lucas
recall
i
be
one
of
the
developer
of
sand
hill
road
and
i
have
a
nice
corner
office
on
the
second
floor
i
be
keep
some
pretty
odd
hour
myself
but
i
notice
that
whenever
i
left
for
home
the
light
in
this
particular
spot
in
the
complex
be
always
on
so
i
finally
go
by
and
ask
them
what
they
be
do
and
i
met
larry
and
bob
miner
and
barbara
later
to
be
the
third
mr
ellison
the
receptionist
and
we
just
get
talk
they
clearly
didn
t
have
a
lot
of
money
and
they
weren
t
very
sophisticated
in
the
way
of
corporate
america
the
first
thing
they
ask
me
be
if
i
d
go
on
the
board
so
i
say
sure
and
i
become
chairman
of
the
board
although
it
be
part
of
lucas
s
job
to
make
equity
investment
in
promising
young
company
ellison
and
miner
be
insistent
that
they
didn
t
need
money
when
they
urgently
need
to
get
inside
digital
s
new
vax
a
sort
of
pdp
on
steroid
to
ensure
that
their
software
could
run
on
the
minicomputer
that
over
the
next
ten
year
would
sweep
all
before
it
rather
than
push
for
a
stake
lucas
arrange
and
guaranteed
a
loan
they
be
very
energetic
very
positive
driven
these
guy
work
not
round
the
clock
but
pretty
close
to
it
there
be
a
very
interest
relationship
between
larry
and
bob
larry
be
the
visionary
the
top
salesman
the
top
cheerleader
the
driver
and
bob
be
clearly
a
very
good
software
architect
make
sure
that
the
oracle
database
work
on
the
vax
virtual
address
extension
be
a
no
brainer
for
ellison
and
miner
the
vax
which
make
its
debut
in
be
the
most
impressive
minicomputer
to
come
onto
the
market
and
all
rsi
s
intelligence
agency
client
be
buying
them
as
quickly
as
digital
could
make
them
while
corporate
customer
saw
them
as
be
capable
enough
to
take
over
at
a
departmental
level
many
of
the
task
previously
reserve
for
mainframe
by
more

the
vast
proportion
from
vax
seat
what
be
less
obvious
but
what
rapidly
become
a
key
part
of
ellison
s
pitch
to
customer
be
oracle
s
ability
to
run
on
just
about
every
conceivable
computer
its
potential
customer
might
own
portability
as
it
s
know
be
the
ability
to
port
software
to
a
give
hardware
platform
it
not
only
meant
that
oracle
could
sell
to
the
wide
possible
market
it
be
also
crucial
for
customer
the
majority
of
which
operate
a
heterogeneous
mix
of
computer
but
want
to
have
only
one
database
the
architecturally
elegant
solution
and
one
that
allow
oracle
to
run
on
the
dozen
or
so
proprietary
operating
system
that
be
current
be
to
maintain
a
single
code
base
and
take
the
gamble
of
write
version
of
the
software
in
a
new
program

call
c
inexpensive

the

translates
a

also
become
available
for
most
of
the
machine
that
ellison
need
oracle
to
run
on
ken
jacob
who
arrive
at
rsi
in
as
employee
number
eighteen
say
it
be
do
at
a
time
when
the
rest
of
the
industry
couldn
t
even
spell
c
even
today
oracle
be
the
only
database
that
can
run
on
all
the
main
operating
system
likely
to
be
found
under
corporate
database
from
microsoft
s
window
through
all
the
various
flavor
of

to
open

mv
multiple

by
the

sensibly
change
its

to

later

and
be
get
ready
to
move
to
an
square
foot
site
in
nearby
belmont
much
of
ellison
s
time
be
spent
talk
up
the
relational
model
don
lucas
say
people
just
didn
t
believe
that
the
relational
model
would
work
there
be
a
great
need
to
do
a
very
high
level
sell
and
say
hey
this
be
go
to
be
the
thing
and
these
be
the
thing
you
could
use
it
for
i
ll
never
forget
be
with
some
guy
an
analyst
and
he
just
say
that
relational
will
never
work
it
s
a
toy
you
know
fun
and
game
we
have
to
fight
that
for
maybe
ten
year
larry
be
very
good
at
this
he
be
like
a
spiritual
leader
an
evangelist
for
the
relational
database
model
while
that
kind
of
high
level
sell
which
include
do
a
lot
of
public
speak
at
conference
suit
ellison
s
talent
rsi
oracle
quickly
need
more
than
just
bob
preger
and
ellison
to
sell
its
product
don
lucas
have
brought
onto
the
board
his
friend
john
clark
who
have
a
background
in
sale
ellison
say
he
patiently
explain
the
basic
of
sale
to
me
if
you
have
a
good
product
the
more
salesperson
you
have
the
more
you
ll
sell
if
you
want
to
sell
twice
as
much
get
twice
as
many
salesperson
i
say
really
it
s
that
simple
okay
we
ll
hire
some
more
salesperson
and
then
we
start
get
these
sale
guy
in
and
they
just
start
to
replicate
kind
of
like
a
virus
inside
of
your
company
a
virus
it
s
an
odd
choice
of
word
and
one
that
indicates
the
ambivalence
that
ellison
have
even
today
about
the
people
he
employ
to
sell
oracle
s
product
for
the
first
few
year
of
its
life
oracle
grow
rather
slowly
by
the
standard
of
today
jenny
overstreet
ellison
s
assistant
and
confidante
for
thirteen
year
remembers
that
when
she
join
the
company
in
there
be
only
fifty
employee
in
california
larry
still
thought
that
be
probably
about
all
oracle
be
ever
go
to
need
in
fact
by
this
time
ellison
have
already
realize
that
oracle
have
the
potential
to
become
something
much
big
the
combination
of
version
s
at
least
theoretical
portability
and
those
replicate
sale
guy
meant
that
sale
be
suddenly
begin
to
explode
ken
jacob
say
of
version
it
be
a
vision
of
what
could
be
do
one
of
the
most
gratify
thing
be
the
tremendous
faith
of
our
early
customer
who
stayed
with
us
through
difficult
time
for
many
of
them
it
be
like
go
through
one
of
those
share
experience
when
a
couple
face
death
but
they
survive
together
one
of
the
smartest
and
most
driven
of
those

recall
the
technical
press

say
at
the
time
that
the
relational
database
would
never
be
useful
and
even
ibm
have
raise
doubt
as
to
whether
it
would
ever
be
suitable
for
transaction
processing
our
job
be
to
call
up
prospect
and
tell
them
that
if
they
would
give
us
a
day
we
would
come

show
them
what
the
technology
be
capable
of
we
d
show
up
in
the
morning
they
would
explain
what
their

be
obviously
everything
be
custom
application
back
then
and
what
they
want
i
have
to
build
it
in

it

a
formidable

abbasi

ellison

the

we
hire
in

be
very
professional
and
service
orient
the
european

long

relationship
with
our
customer
and
do
business
with
them
on
a
regular
basis
this
european
farm
strategy
be
in
stark
contrast
to
the
u
s
sale
organization
s
hunt
strategy
u
s
salesperson
try
to
sell
the
large
possible
transaction
to
a
give
customer
and
then
move
on
to
the
next
customer
and
the
next
deal
it
take
me
until
to
figure
out
that
the
u
s
hunt
strategy
be
both
shortsighted
and
unsustainable
it
take
another
decade
to
change
the
culture
of
the
u
s
sale
force
from
hunter
to
farmer
the
responsibility
for
building
up
the
u
s
sale
organization
fell
first
to
mike
seashols
a
confident
and
highly
competitive
salesman
who
like
kennedy
be
religiously
devout
a
member
of
the
intensely
evangelical
covenant
church
who
read
the
bible
every
morning
before
go
out
to
do
battle
it
be
seashols
who
recruit
kennedy
while
kennedy
hire
other
super
salesman
such
as
siebel
greg
brady
who
go
on
to
found
i
the
supply
chain
specialist
and
craig
conway
who
become
ceo
of
the
erp
vendor
peoplesoft
seashols
be
fire
by
ellison
and
replace
by
kennedy
in
for
reason
that
remain
obscure
seashols
claim
that
he
have
express
discomfort
with
some
of
the
statement
in
the
company
prospectus
that
be
circulate
to
investor
before
the
public
offering
others
suggest
that
he
wasn
t
make
his
number
which
be
difficult
to
believe
give
that
oracle
s
u
s
sale
be
pretty
much
double
every
year
while
seashols
be
responsible
one
possibility
be
that
ellison
have
conclude
that
he
wasn
t
hungry
enough
seashols
recall
a
dinner
with
ellison
it
be
right
before
we
go
public
larry
ask
what
be
you
go
to
do
with
all
your
money
i
have
no
idea
my
house
be
paid
for
i
be
drive
a
new
car
i
didn
t
have
any
need
i
could
think
of
i
say
something
about
just
want
to
be
content
i
think
that
really
take
him
aback
that
say
ellison
be
still
not
give
much
of
his
attention
to
what
be
or
wasn
t
happen
in
sale
as
far
as
ellison
be
concerned
overwhelmingly
the
most
important
contribution
he
could
make
to
oracle
s
success
be
to
concentrate
on
make
the
product
well
he
simply
didn
t
regard
himself
as
competent
to
concern
himself
with
all
the
other
thing
that
a
ceo
be
suppose
to
be
responsible
for
to
some
at
oracle
ellison
s
approach
be
one
of
enlighten
delegation
you
could
say
that
he
say
but
it
be
closer
to
abdication
than
delegation
in
fact
ellison
have
every
reason
to
concentrate
on
the
product
mike
stonebraker
have
take
the
ingres
relational
database
project
he
have
overseen
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
and
form
a
company
around
it
call
relational
technology
inc
although
a
commercial
version
of
ingres
have
come
to
market
a
little
later
than
oracle
stonebraker
s
outfit
be
grow
faster
than
ellison
s
in
oracle
s
sale
have
double
to
million
while
ingres
as
rti
be
increasingly
know
have
triple
its
sale
to
million
ellison
say
they
be
really
kick
our
butt
they
be
catch
up
fast
because
we
have
just
rewrite
our
database
product
and
we
be
have
software
quality
problem
sound
familiar
the
berkeley
team
at
ingres
have
have
much
more
time
to
refine
their
user
language
quel
than
oracle
have
to
develop
sql
and
many
relational
expert
thought
it
be
intrinsically
a
superior
language
ellison
say
maybe
quel
be
well
than
sql
maybe
french
be
well
than
english
it
didn
t
matter
english
and
sql
be
go
to
win
what
ellison
be
most
worried
about
be
the
sheer
engineering
talent
at
ingres
it
have
become
painfully
clear
to
me
that
our
development
organization
wasn
t
good
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
team
at
ingres
so
we
have
to
rebuild
it
if
stonebraker
be
hire
the
best
kid
from
uc
berkeley
we
would
hire
the
best
kid
from
caltech
mit
and
stanford
we
would
also
recruit
the
very
best
experienced
program
talent
in
the
valley
in
a
real
coup
we
hire
a
superb
team
from
xerox
parc
one
of
those
guy
derry
kabcenell
be
among
the
most
important
people
ever
to
work
at
oracle
thanks
to
derry
and
the
new
engineering
team
he
lead
we
overcame
the
software
quality
problem
in
oracle
version
he
deliver
a
superior
database
product
a
product
we
could
be
proud
of
a
product
that
would
kill
ingres
we
call
it
oracle
version
kabcenell
now
work
at
oracle
only
part
time
but
he
still
contributes
his
idea
and
experience
to
major
software
architecture
project
he
s
a
slightly
built
man
who
talk
softly
with
an
almost
professorial
air
the
thing
that
he
remembers
most
vividly
about
his
hire
be
the
speed
at
which
the
little
company
be
recruiting
a
friend
have
join
in
january
when
there
be
about
thirty
people
on
board
but
by
the
time
kabcenell
arrive
in
september
the
number
have
grown
to
seventy
and
the
intensity
of
his
interview
with
ellison
i
be
really
impressed
at
his
grasp
of
the
technology
and
also
his
respect
for
the
professional
practice
of
program
i
be
do
a
pretty
extensive
set
of
interview
with
different
company
and
have
a
chance
to
meet
a
bunch
of
people
include
ctos
nobody
i
d
met
be
as
addict
to
technology
as
larry
be
in
my
interview
he
described
a
feature
that
be
just
be
developed
in
the
database
that
s
still
important
today
call
read
consistency
he
described
that
to
me
and
ask
what
i
thought
about
it
i
be
just
amaze
that
i
be
have
that
kind
of
conversation
with
the
ceo
the
first
time
i
d
met
him
it
be
a
technique
that
ellison
use
with
all
the
recruit
to
the
development
team
it
make
them
want
to
work
for
oracle
and
it
ensure
that
he
be
hire
only
people
who
be
smart
enough
to
debate
technical
issue
with
him
at
the
high
level
andy
mendelsohn
like
kabcenell
a
graduate
of
mit
who
join
in
the
same
year
remembers
in
the
interview
with
larry
i
be
very
surprised
by
the
technical
level
of
the
question
he
discuss
different
way
to
use
index
to
resolve
result
from
a
sql
query
it
be
a
real
detailed
kind
of
thing
but
it
show
me
that
he
actually
understood
the
technology
hire
people
such
as
kabcenell
mendelsohn
and
another
recruit
from
the
same
year
roger
bamford
be
the
only
way
that
ellison
believe
oracle
could
have
a
future
eighteen
year
later
nearly
all
the
people
that
ellison
brought
into
the
engineering
team
at
that
time
be
still
at
oracle
and
be
still
despite
middle
age
and
huge
wealth
involve
in
cut
edge
work
on
the
late
version
of
the

for
all
the

for
revolve
door
in
the
executive
suite
and
a

and
fire
culture
in

the
people
responsible
for
create
and
develop
the
core
product
know
within
oracle
as
the
kernel
group
have
be
an
extraordinarily
loyal
and
stable
team
while
many
part
of
the
business
actually
need
staff
turnover
to
stay
fresh
and
vigorous
ellison
believe
that
keep
the
elite
kernel
group
together
have
be
vital
the
process
of
building
a
software

teach
a

what
to
do
and
what
to
avoid
the

and
experience
within
the
forty
or
fifty
strong

group
come
from
continuous
work
on
improve
the
core

rather
than
from
some
extension
of
the

that
will
make
a
flashy
new

derry
kabcenell
s
impact
at
oracle
be
immediate
ellison
say
the
first
version
of
our
database
version
be
a
good
work
prototype
write
in
pdp
assembly
language
the
same
language
that
i
write
the
earlier
codasyl
database
in
version
be
totally
rewrite
in
c
it
be
much
big
and
more
complex
than
version
and
as
a
result
plague
by
quality
problem
derry
make
version
work
by
go
around
rewrite
other
programmer
code
and
fix
their
bug
one
of
our
programmer
have
be
work
on
a
problem
for
six
month
and
derry
bless
his
heart
just
come
in
one
weekend
and
rewrote
the
whole
thing
of
course
it
work
perfectly
derry
combine
brilliance
with
discipline
and
endurance
it
s
a
rare
combination
of
course
he
have
perfect
grade
at
mit
derry
s
not
a
perfectionist
he
s
an
obsessive
perfectionist
sometimes
his
thoroughness
go
over
the
top
i
remember
when
he
be
buying
a
condominium
he
told
me
that
he
have
carefully
read
all
twenty
page
of
the
sale
and
owner
association
contract
he
read
a
law
book
to
make
certain
he
fully
understood
what
he
be
signing
several
year
later
derry
confide
in
me
that
he
be
worried
that
his
brain
might
have
fill
up
because
his
memory
be
not
as
good
as
it
use
to
be
i
told
him
it
be
his
own
fault
for
clutter
up
that
wonderful
brain
with
all
those
stupid
condominium
agreement
as
well
as
ensure
that
oracle
have
the
talent
to
compete
with
ingres
ellison
make
sure
that
the
development
team
be
building
the
right
thing
if
we
built
the
right
product
the
right
way
we
would
win
that
be
my
view
of
the
world
then
and
that
s
my
view
of
the
world
now
ellison
bridle
at
the
suggestion
of
some
former
colleague
that
bob
miner
be
run
the
development
team
while
he
be
out
sell
i
love
bob
everyone
do
he
be
an
uncommonly
humane
generous
and
care
person
but
his
egalitarian
nature
prevent
him
from
ever
cross
over
from
labor
to
management
he
love
be
one
of
the
guy
too
much
he
wouldn
t
give
that
up
for
anything
certainly
not
for
money
or
fame
neither
of
which
interested
him
much
so
bob
become
the
head
of
the
oracle
programmer
union
shop
steward
and
father
confessor
he
be
the
moral
and
spiritual
leader
of
the
engineering
team
of
the
entire
company
really
he
be
the
guy
you
go
to
if
you
have
a
personal
problem
when
the
person
i
consider
our
bad
programmer
lose
half
his
oracle
stock
in
a
divorce
bob
thought
the
company
should
make
it
up
to
him
i
have
want
to
fire
the
guy
for
year
bob
wouldn
t
allow
it
he
protect
his
people
like
a
mother
bear
while
i
couldn
t
fire
any
of
his
people
bob
be
perfectly
happy
to
let
me
recruit
the
new
member
of
the
program
team
which
i
do
and
manage
the
development
process
the
kernel
group
veteran
i
ve
spoken
to
bear
out
ellison
s
claim
very
often
ellison
would
say
that
something
be
in
the
database
that
hadn
t
yet
be
do
after
version
have
come
out
he
write
a
little
spiral
bound
book
describe
oracle
and
the
sql
language
he
say
someone
jokingly
say
it
take
us
eight
year
to
make
the
database
product
look
like
your
book
not
exactly
true
but
what
be
important
be
that
we
be
make
steady
progress
and
we
be
ahead
of
the
competition
most
of
the
time
the
database
just
kept
get
well
and
well
if
version
be
all
about
portability
the
most
significant
feature
of
version
which
come
out
a
year
later
in
apart
from
the
all
important
reliability
that
derry
kabcenell
have
give
it
be
read
consistency
or
the
assurance
that
a
query
against
the
database
will
read
a
set
of
data
that
remains
consistent
during
the
time
it
take
to
execute
the
query
for
example
money
be
switch
between
bank
account
during
a
query
could
not
be
miscomputed
and
employee
be
add
to
an
hr
database
not
be
count
twice
with
the
solidity
of
version
and
oracle
s
increasingly
aggressive
sale
force
ingres
be
hard
press
to
maintain
its
momentum
but
the
real
threat
be
the
decision
of
the
american
national
standard
institute
ansi
support
by
ibm
to
declare
sql
the
standard
relational
database
language
mike
stonebraker
of
ingres
didn
t
even
bother
to
show
up
at
the
committee
meeting
to
make
the
quite
strong
case
for
adopt
quel
because
he
be
ideologically
oppose
to
set
technology
standard
it
be
the
behavior
of
an
intellectually
arrogant
academic
rather
than
a
prudent
businessman
protect
the
interest
of
his
company
ellison
say
stonebraker
invent
quel
and
stuck
with
it
like
a
proud
father
while
ibm
and
oracle
support
the
sql
standard
lack
of
sql
support
hurt
ingres
badly
but
so
do
lack
of
portability
and
read
consistency
and
ingres
have
fall
far
behind
in
performance
all
this
together
conspire
to
kill
off
ingres
as
a
competitor
in
the
database
market
no
sooner
have
that
threat
of
ingres
be
dilute
than
others
appear
in
ibm
release
a
relational
database
for
big
mainframe
call
db
but
it
be
part
of
the
process
by
which
sql
become
a
standard
and
oracle
do
only
a
small
amount
of
business
on
mainframe
anyway
two
newer
rival
however
be
determine
to
grab
a
large
part
of
oracle
s
fast
grow
business
the
lesser
of
the
threat
come
from
informix
because
of
its
concentration
on
the
nascent
unix
market
although
unix
would
become
the

sybase
on
the
other
hand
come
from
nowhere
to
become
a
dangerous
competitor
a
spin
off
from
a

britton

sybase
have
come
up
with
the

live
in

while
the

would
live

although

support

contain
a
feature
that

have
not
be
design
from
the
begin
for
the
separation
of
client

ellison
say
the
key
thing
that
sybase
have
that
we
didn
t
be
a
programmable
server
the
ability
to
write
program
call
store

that
ran
inside
the

this
allow
sybase
to
build
and
advertise
two
feature
referential
integrity
and
two
phase
commit
that
they
have
and
we
lack
these
key
differentiator
give
sybase
immediate
traction
in
the
market
two
phase

make
it
possible
to
execute
a

you
have

out
of
one
computer
and
a
check
deposit
into
the
other
with
a
separate
database
that
whole
thing
would
have
transactional
integrity
either
both
update
would
occur
or
neither
would
referential

provide
for
an

in
the

table
as
one
of
the

that

like
about
sybase

that
with
its

it
be
a

that
could
be

ellison

that
the

not
allow
the

a

so
many

it
almost
kill
the

but
its

the
foundation
for
much
of
what
differentiates
our

something
we
have
to
do
to
move
ahead
of

but
while
we
be
try
to
finish

version
fell
far

far
behind
sybase
with

ambitious

its

force
now
under
the
relentless
gary

and
ellison

fear
that

the

team
found
itself
subject
to
appal
pressure
to
declare

ready
to

ellison
say
there
be
an
overwhelm
sense
of
frustration
we
have
delayed
version
and
then
delayed
it
again
and
again
and
again
delay
it
one
more
time
seem
unbearable
we
have
do
a
lot
of
test
and
i
thought
that
it
be
good
enough
to
go
i
be
wrong
when
we
do
release
version
in
it
have
more
bug
than
any
of
us
believe
be
possible
the
decision
to
ship
oracle
unfinished
be
the
begin
of

badly
miss
its

technology

technically
brilliant

not
enough
of
a
businessman
to
manage
the
company
he

left
because
my
venture
people
would
have
driven
me
out
pretty
soon
after
he
have
a
conversation
with
ellison
larry
say
that
his
strategy
for
get
into
the
application
business
would
have
be
to
have
hire
somebody
from

interactive

it

technology
leader
he
have
never
thought
he
could
get
me
at
the
time
walker
interactive
be
slightly
big
than
oracle
i
told
him
that
i
thought
i
be
unmanageable
and
i
didn
t
really
want
to
work
for
anybody
he
assure
me
that
i
would
not
really
be
work
for
him
that
we
would
be
merely
collaborator
when
walker
arrive
there
be
just
one
other
person
in
the
application
division
true
to
his
word
ellison
give
walker
a
free
hand
to
work
out
a

people
and
design
the
initial
application
walker
who
now
run
another
troubled
application
company
call
tenfold
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
his
own
ability
he
claim
that
in
the
six
year
to
his
departure
from
the

come
from

the

leader

really
enter
the

at
that
point
with
their
r
client
server
product
they
be
sell
r
their

product
but
they
weren
t
really
as
successful
as
oracle
it
s
an
interest
point
of
view
however
just
run
oracle
s
application
operation
be
not
a
big
enough
job
for
the
multitalented
walker
after
a
spell
when
he
both
have
his
development
responsibility
and
have
become
head
of
marketing
in
late
ellison
ask
him
to
take
on
the
job
of
cfo
while
stay
as
head
of

walker
say
larry
quickly
realize
that
i
have
management
strength
and
experience
that
he
need
on
his
team
it
be
not
something
that
i
have
do
before
but
i
think
that
i
do
a
credible
job
as
cfo
don
lucas
remembers
larry
just
announce
to
me
that
jeff
be
go
to
be
cfo
jeff
s
a
nice
person
i
like
jeff
but
i
spent
hour
probably
an
average
of
an
hour
a
day
on
the
telephone
try
to
talk
through
finance
with
him
but
he
s
an
engineer
and
to
be
honest
it
be
a
personality
issue
he
never
get
it
larry
s
approach
be
to
delegate
massively
completely
almost
totally
that
s
the
good
news
as
long
as
he
get
good
people
it
really
work
but
when
he
get
a
person
like
jeff
who
be
a
very
smart
guy
but
not
a
brilliant
cfo
walker
s
appointment
wasn
t
the
strangest
thing
that
happen
at
oracle
during
that
time
gary
kennedy
be
under
appal
pressure
to
meet
the
herculean
target
that
be
imply
by
ellison

commitment
to
continually
double

kennedy
have
become
convince
that
the
corporate
legal
department
be
actively
prevent
deal
by
take
too
long
to
vet
sale
contract
the
answer
he
argue
be
to
give
u
s
sale
its
own
contract
and
finance
organization
ellison
acquiesce
gary
told
me
he
couldn
t
get
the
job
do
because
the
legal
department
didn
t
report
to
sale
and
they
be
slow
in
processing
deal
i
say
okay
you
can
have
the
legal
department
what
kind
of
ceo
let
the
salesperson
write
their

that

brave

she

none
of
the
thing
mention
in
the

be
execute
not

all
the
region
implement
their
own
process
and
start
do
their
own

u

didn

want

to

watch
over

they
didn

move

hashemi
insists
that
gary
kennedy
never
ask
her
personally
to
do
anything
unethical
but
all
hell
be
break
loose
essentially
u
s
sale
be
now
responsible
for
oversight
of
its

review

and

without
any

kennedy
want
a
huge
expansion

force
and
told
hashemi
to
organize
the
recruitment
of
additional

within
nine
month
not
surprisingly
few
of
those
take

time
to

properly
train
or
induct
before
they
be
sent
out
into

field
unless
the
new

start
sell
quickly
and
bring
in

the
cost
of
such
breakneck

would
be
cripple
it
s
hard
to
say
how
much
more
jeff
walker
could
have
do
other
than
to
threaten
to
resign
as
cfo
but
he
make
thing
bad
by
support
the
extreme
form
of
delegation
that
ellison
have
carelessly
encourage
amazingly
even
today
he
defends
it
larry
have
found
a
management
team
of
very
strong
individual
guy
that
could
work
together
and
yet
autonomously
run
their
area
it
be
almost
a
feudal
environment
in
term
of
feudal
lord
over
whom
larry
as
king
only
have
very
weak
control
he
chose
to
make
them
weak
i
think
it
be
a
wonderful
decision
on
his
part
because
it
allow
oracle
to
come
out
of
nowhere
and
become
this
huge
market
force
walker
make
thing
still
harder
for
himself
by
believe
so
passionately
in
the
efficacy
of
his
own
financial
application
that
he
thought
he
could

up

there
he
be
building
product

sell

commitment
meant
that
you

what
you
have
undertaken
to

period
it
sound
good
but
the
consequence
of
kennedy

terrify
insistence
on

be
appal
if

a

have
become
so
anxious
about
the
ballooning

that
he
have
start
to
trawl
through
as
many
of
the

the
likelihood
of

be
minimal
what
follow
be
more
than
a
devastate
year
of
purgatory
for
both

ellison
imbler
manage
to
persuade

such
precipitous
single

drop
be
much
less
common
than
they
be
now
it
should
have
be
the
warn
that
ellison
need
to

he
fully
expect
to
make
up
the

in

back
on

i
have
absolutely
no

which
meant
get

the

the

that
the

to
play
down
the
seriousness
of
what
have
happen
to
oracle
it
be
one
lose
quarter
couple
with
some
accounting
irregularity
as
a
consequence
of
rapid
growth
lack
of
central
control
and
a
far
flung
empire
of
somewhat
autonomous
organization
if
the
company
have
held
adequate
cash
at
the
time
it
would
have
be
nothing
more
than
a
little
blip
what

it
a
near
death
experience
be
the
lack
of
cash
as
the
cfo
of

i
and
the

work
hard
to
encourage

the

something
about
it
have
it
chosen
to
do
so
ellison
be
determine
to
avoid
the
dilution
of

and
by
his

account
be
too
uninterested
to

a
prudent
insurance
policy
against
a

in

simply
too
boring
and
the

do
not
press
him
on
it
it
be
a
recklessness
that

there
be
desperation
but
what
he
clung
to
be
his
belief
in
the
company
jeff
walker
say
my
observation
be
that
he
dealt
with
it
in
a
forthright
and
manly
way
no
one
be
happy
about
it
but
there
be
thing
that
he
have
to
do
and
decision
that
he
have
to
take
i
never
saw
petulant
or
childish
behavior
i
never
saw
withdrawal
or
a
fear
to
face
fact
pressure
can
make
us
react
in
perverse
way
but
i
never
saw
any
of
that
he
dealt
with
it
ellison
say
i
couldn
t
run
away
i
have
to
save
oracle
to
save
myself
i
have
no
choice
in
one
sense
ellison
be
very
lucky
indeed
he
could
easily
have
lose
his
job
before
he
have
a
chance
to
fix
the
mess
he
have
help
create
don
lucas
say
i
can
say
this
now
and
larry
know
this
that
not
all
the
board
be
in
favor
of
keep
larry
on
i
be
chairman
and
i
be
one
hundred
percent
convince
that
this
be
not
a
good
time
to
make
a
change
larry
be
inspirational
to
the
company
he
understood
the
technology
and
despite
the
problem
with
oracle
the
technology
be
great
the
problem
be
in
not
have
proper
accounting
and
the
need
to
clean
up
and
push
that
out
to
the
field
to
sale
and
say
thou
wilt
not
do
this
and
this
be
the
way
you
will
do
thing
this
be
a
simple
problem
what
we
really
need
to
do
be
get
a
good
financial
officer
ellison
say
i
ll
always
be
grateful
to
don
for
trust
me
and
give
me
another
chance
even
though
i
probably
didn
t
deserve
it
how
much
of
the
blame
for
what
happen
should
stick
to
ellison
and
how
much
to
kennedy
and
walker
as
ceo
ellison
clearly
have
to
take
overall
responsibility
the
extreme
form
of
delegation
he
pursue
what
he
describes
as
his
abdication
model
of
management
be
a
form
of
self
indulgence
rather
than
a
brilliant
insight
into
how
to
get
the
best
from
talented
manager
i
be
interested
in
the
technology
i
wasn
t
interested
in
sale
or
accounting
or
legal
if
i
wasn
t
interested
in
something
i
simply
ignore
it
the
manager
who
want
to
run
their
part
of
the
business
with
minimum
interference
be
quite
happy
that
nobody
be
look
over
their
shoulder
unfortunately
if
people
ran
amok
the
problem
they
create
would
not
become
visible
until
they
have
grown
so
large
that
they
be
difficult
to
fix
all
i
have
to
do
be
keep
legal
and
accounting
organize
as
separate
control
function
and
a
lot
of
the
problem
we
have
in
could
have
be
avoid
you
cannot
run
a
company
without
strong
check
and
balance
ellison
s
defense
today
be
still
pretty
much
what
it
be
at
the
time
that
he
be
naive
and
inexperienced
but
he
know
that
it
s
not
enough
to
absolve
him
he
add
i
just
wasn
t
pay
proper
attention
to
my
job
i
be
do
only
the
thing
that
interested
me
it
be
the
same
problem
i
have
in
school
but
this
happen
in
my
forty
i
wasn
t
a
kid
anymore
exactly
the
truth
be
that
ellison
found
almost
everything
about
run
a
company
other
than
create
a
vision
of
what
oracle
s
technology
could
do
and
drive
the
product
development
strategy
to
achieve
it
boring
and
in
some
sense
beneath
him
but
later
after
he
realize
he
have
a
duty
to
know
about
the
supposedly
tedious
detail
of
how
a
sale
force
should
be
compensate
and
revenue
recognize
he
discover
it
wasn
t
so
dull
and
trivial
after
all
ellison
also
have
a
genuine
respect
for
walker
s
intellect
which
blind
him
to
his
other
fault
i
like
very
smart
people
and
walker
s
very
smart
in
those
day
whenever
i
be
defend
somebody
my
defense
would
be
to
point
out
how
smart
they
be
geoff
squire
wasn
t
impressed
by
this
argument
he
say
yes
larry
he
s
very
smart
but
can
he
do
his
fuck
job
i
just
star
at
geoff
and
say
nothing
but
i
be
think
oh
god
he
s
right
brilliance
be
not
enough
as
far
as
kennedy
be
concerned
ellison
seem
to
think
that
his
religious
fervor
would
prevent
him
from
do
anything
morally
dubious
i
never
thought
gary
be
capable
of
be
unethical
but
i
also
knew
he
hat
lose
more
than
anything
ellison
use
to
play
basketball
with
kennedy
on
one
occasion
the
oracle
team
be
down
by
twenty
point
in
the
fourth
quarter
to
a
team
from
stanford
late
in
the
game
i
pass
the
ball
to
gary
and
jokingly
say
hey
we
can
still
beat
these
guy
gary
give
me
a
look
of
total
disgust
how
could
i
give
up
before
the
game
be
over
he
hat
lose
the
feel
be
so
strong
it
could
only
have
come
from
his
childhood
gary
come
from
a
very
modest
background
his
father
work
as
a
miner
in
wyoming
forty
mile
from
the
family
home
in
randolph
utah
in
his
family
you
be
taught
never
to
give
up
gary
would
fight
to
the
limit
not
to
lose
but
surely
that
refusal
to
accept
defeat
be
precisely
the
quality
that
convince
ellison
to
put
kennedy
in
charge
of
u
s
sale
when
ellison
commit
oracle
to
double
its
revenue
each
year
when
he
present
the
five
in
five
plan
didn
t
he
realize
he
be
create
the
condition
in
which
somebody
as
driven
as
kennedy
would
be
unable
to
stop
himself
from
go
too
far
i
think
ellison
be
disingenuous
in
argue
he
be
not
responsible
for
a
good
deal
of
the
pressure
that
turn
the
oracle
sale
force
into
an
out
of
control
monster
if
a
demand
from
the
ceo
to
keep
double
revenue
each
year
even
with
a
shaky
product
and
weaken
economy
be
not
pressure
it
s
hard
to
know
what
be
the
frequently
declare
determination
to
wipe
out
database
rival
such
as
ingres
and
ashton
tate
and
the
testosterone
charge
advertising
that
oracle
indulge
in
to
convey
its
message
of
dominance
one
series
of
ad
depict
oracle
as
a
sleek
f
shoot
down
ashton
tate
s
world
war
i
biplane
breed
a
win
at
all
cost
culture
that
come
at
least
as
much
from
ellison
as
from
kennedy
give
ellison
s
abdication
model
of
management
it
be
also
surely
his
responsibility
to
have
a
qualify
tough
cfo
to
establish
and
police
business
rule
make
walker
cfo
just
because
he
be
smart
and
be
design
financial
application
be
a
decision
of
extraordinary
frivolity
while
integrate
the
legal
department
with
u
s
sale
be
equally
irresponsible
in
partial
mitigation
however
it
have
to
be
remember
that
the
software
business
more
than
a
decade
ago
be
extremely
immature
until
the
early
s
nearly
all
software
have
be
sell
with
hardware
accord
to
the
vertically
integrate
model
establish
by
the
like
of
ibm
and
hewlett
packard
enterprise
software
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
product
and
the
time
it
usually
take
to
install
lends
itself
more
than
anything
else
to
company
that
be
likely
to
spend
large
sum
of
money
on
exotic
and
innovative
deal
make
don
lucas
say
software
by
its
very
nature
be
an
intangible
the
same
tape
can
be
worth
or
and
so
be
susceptible
to
a
vast
number
and
variety
of
business
relationship
and
of
course
at
that
time
we
didn
t
have
standardize
contract
and
the
accounting
profession
be
just
come
up
to
speed
and
you
know
we
be
call
cowboy
but
there
be
many
different
way
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
provision
and
the
detail
and
so
on
some
salesman
give
customer
the
right
to
return
the
software
of
course
that
s
lunacy
that
s
not
competent
but
in
between
that
which
be
zero
and
a
clean
book
cash
down
there
s
a
vast
array
of
consideration
ironically
give
tom
siebel
s
stricture
about
the
ethical
standard
at
oracle
when
he
be
there
ellison
always
cite
siebel
as
a
salesman
whose
creativity
get
him
and
the
company
into
trouble
tom
be
and
be
a
super
salesman
he
be
the
king
of
the
deal
but
not
every
deal
be
good
for
the
company
ellison
hasn
t
see
kennedy
since
he
left
oracle
to
almost
everyone
s
consternation
when
jeff
walker
found
tenfold
in
he
ask
gary
kennedy
to
be
its
ceo
even
if
it
meant
base
the
business
in
salt
lake
city
gary
and
i
didn
t
have
a
lot
in
common
other
than
work
and
the
occasional
basketball
game
we
never
spent
time
together
although
he
won
t
quite
say
it
it
s
clear
that
he
still
blame
kennedy
in
large
part
for
oracle
s
crash
and
for
the
humiliation
of
have
to
restate
earnings
for
three
quarter
and
submit
to
a
brutal
sec
investigation
that
result
in
a
fine
it
have
left
ellison
with
a
profound
distrust
not
to
say
distaste
for
the
thing
that
salesperson
will
do
to
get
a
deal
in
one
particular
however
ellison
do
recognize
something
of
himself
in
gary
kennedy
like
gary
i
ve
always
be
more
motivate
by
fear
of
failure
than
by
greed
and
i
hate
lose
but
bending
the
rule
be
a
bad
strategy
it
s
more
likely
to
bring
on
defeat
than
victory
there
be
something
slightly
disturb
in
ellison
s
treatment
of
kennedy
ellison
give
the
impression
of
have
be
almost
kennedy
s
victim
yet
kennedy
recruit
the
most
talented
and
fear
by
both
competitor
and
customer
it
have
to
be
admit
sale
force
the
technology
business
have
ever
see
some
of
them
may
have
go
off
the
rail
and
gotten
ellison
into
trouble
but
without
them
it
s
doubtful
that
oracle
would
be
the
powerhouse
it
be
today
ellison
like
to
believe
that
by
and
large
great
product
sell
themselves
but
oracle
s
be
not
always
unambiguously
well
than
those
of
its
rival
whereas
its
sale
force
be
invariably
smarter
tougher
and
more
relentless
the
question
of
how
much
blame
attache
to
ellison
remains
difficult
to
gauge
one
thing
he
accepts
without
equivocation
be
that
he
practice
management
by
abdication
he
do
not
deny
negligence
there
be
even
some
justification
for
his
abdication
model
it
wasn
t
just
that
he
enjoy
drive
product
development
more
than
the
other
stuff
he
be
convince
that
it
be
in
that
area
that
he
could
make
the
great
contribution
to
oracle
s
success
while
bob
miner
be
suppose
to
be
run
development
he
be
never
prepared
to
lead
his
programmer
in
the
kind
of
death
march
that
win
software
company
have
to
be
ready
for
when
product
be
late
or
fail
ellison
say
with
fond
exasperation
bob
love
and
take
care
of
the
people
that
work
for
him
he
would
never
ask
them
to
work
weekend
because
he
thought
they
should
spend
time
with
their
family
the
fact
that
oracle
be
have
such
a
terrible
time
get
version
of
the
database
to
work
properly
and
the
advance
that
be
be
make
by
sybase
make
that
focus
on
the
product
all
the
more
urgent
ellison
say
to
beat
sybase
we
have
to
deliver
oracle
version
that
s
what
i
spent
my
time
on
i
ignore
everything
else
nor
be
it
obvious
that
make
oracle
as
big
as
possible
as
quickly
as
possible
and
relentlessly
pursue
market
share
be
the
wrong
strategy
ellison
say
among
our
early
competitor
ingres
and
informix
be
go
and
sybase
be
on
life
support
silicon
valley
be
a
kill
field
very
few
technology
company
survive
we
do
it
be
this
rather
than
the
pursuit
of
a
particular
revenue
number
that
fuel
ellison
s
competitive
drive
ellison
understood
that
once
a
customer
commit
to
a
database
vendor
he
be
pretty
well
lock
in
for
the
next
ten
year
or
so
release
oracle
when
it
wasn
t
ready
be
extremely
risky
but
delay
it
still
far
would
only
have
allow
sybase
to
become
more
entrench
in
the
market
it
might
have
be
a
lousy
way
to
treat
customer
and
it
might

to

to
ellison
the
alternative
of
lose
those
customer
for
good
would
have
be
bad
perhaps
ellison
s
gravest
fault
be
be
instrumental
in
allow
the
firm
s
cash
position
to
become
so
nearly
terminal
he
might
not
have
be
sufficiently
aware
of
his
duty
to
note
the
fragility
of
his
own
company
s
balance
sheet
but
remarkably
he
felt
qualify
to
ignore
the
warning
of
others
that
single
sin
of
omission
may
well
have
have
the
most
serious
consequence
of
all
if
as
jeff
walker

have
advise
oracle
have
raise

it
hadn

need
it
the
consequence
of
the
lose
quarter

the
revenue
restatement
would
have
be
little
more
than
an
embarrass
stumble
ellison
s
claim
that
he
be
incompetent
be
only
half
true
he
combine
arrogance
and
recklessness
to
a
degree
that
be
very
nearly
lethal
for
oracle
but
against
that
he
built
something
so
inherently
resilient
and
valuable
that
both
he
and
oracle
would
have
the
chance
to
reinvent
themselves
as
jeff
walker
put
it
if
you
take
a
brilliant
compulsive
personality
and
you
subject
them
to
a
learn
experience
they
learn
brilliantly
and
compulsively

three
thing

back
together
the
first
be
to

with

the
second
be
to
bring
in
season
manager
who
would
bring
some
solidity
to
what
be
now
a
billion
dollar
company
and
give
confidence
to
investor
that
the
mistake
of
the
past
would
not
be
repeat
finally
he
have
to
overcome
the
reliability
problem
of

make
sure
that
the
next
release

more
than
hold
its
own
in
the
feature
race
with
sybase
of
all
these
the
most
urgent
be
oracle
s
dangerous
cash
crunch
ellison
knew
that
a
conventional
financing
solution
would
not
be
available
on
anything
less
than
the
most
punitive
term
term
that
would
undermine
his
position
as

s
dominant
shareholder
by
destroy
the

of
the

held
by

most
important
employee
the
key
developer
ron
wohl
be
a
young
product
manager
who
for
several
year
have
be
a
notably
loyal
staff
officer
he
remembers
not
only
do
we
not
have
cash
we
have
not
make
good
banking
or
other
arrangement
for

we

which
could
have
result
in
the

we
need
to
raise

money

the

interested
in
participate
in
high
tech
larry
have
a
very
strong
personal
interest

japan
so
he
begin
some
initial
discussion
with
japanese
company
which
rapidly
center
on
nippon
steel
a
very
very
capable
company
larry
ask
me
to
take
a
lead
in
the
negotiation
because
our
cfo
at
the
time
jeff

have
lose
credibility
and
larry
be
in
the
process

look
for
a
new
cfo
ellison
make
it
wohl
s
mission
to
get
million
while
give
as
little
oracle
equity
away
as
possible
although
initially
the
japanese
be
bewilder
to
be
deal
with
a
rather
junior
thirty
year
old
wohl
turn
out
to
be
an
inspire
choice
wohl
have
an
almost
oriental
inscrutability
that
make
him
an
extremely
cagey
negotiator
and
at
time
an
infuriate
colleague
even
in
normal
conversation
his
wariness
and
reluctance
to
commit
himself
can
be
unsettle
ellison
say
ron
be
extremely
smart
and
very
cautious
he
hate
error
of
commission
which
mean
he
can
be
slow
to
make
decision
that
s
very
japanese
not
surprisingly
the
negotiation
proceed
at
a
glacial
pace
wohl
say
give
the
complexity
it
be
a
long
drawn
out
negotiation
involve
a
lot
of
money
a
lot
of
complicate
financial
arrangement
some
partial
ownership
of
oracle
and
some
board
arrangement
in
japan
during
that
time
oracle
s
financial
position
be
get
well
by
the
day
and
we
need
much
less
money
so
much
well
in
fact
that
it
dawn
on
wohl
that
his
bos
didn
t
really
want
him
to
do
the
deal
at
all
with
an
agreement
imminent
with
the
cash
rich
japanese
ellison
be
able
to
hold
off
oracle
s
banker
and
buy
time
to
renegotiate
a
different
and
much
more
advantageous
deal
with
nippon
steel
than
originally
conceive
by
the
end
of
with
expense
under
reasonable
control
and
the
beginning
of
recovery
in
the
economy
oracle
have
return
to
robust
if
unspectacular
profitability
and
the
stock
be
climb
instead
of
surrender
equity
in
oracle
to
pay
off
the
bank
ellison
have
secure
a
deal
that
give
oracle
an
million
loan
on
highly
favorable
term
in
exchange
for
which
nippon
steel
have
warrant
to
buy
up
to
percent
of
oracle
japan
at
an
exercise
price
that
give
a
value
to
the
subsidiary
of
million
it
wasn
t
quite
a
case
of
and
with
one
bound
jack
be
free
but
it
be
get
close
another
reason
for
the
restore
order
of
oracle
s
finance
be
the
arrival
in
early
of
a
new
cfo
ellison
accepted
that
oracle
need
a
high
class
conventional
professional
cfo
rather
than
someone
else
who
in
geoff
squire
s
word
be
smart
but
couldn
t
do
the
job
about
the
only
thing
that
jeff
henley
have
in
common
with
his
predecessor
be
the
same
first
name
accord
to
don
lucas
henley
be
a
straight
arrow
a
perfect
choice
we
be
extremely
fortunate
in
find
jeff
he
be
very
highly
consider
by
his
peer
he
d
be
there
do
that
he
d
work
for
memorex
and
one
of
the
semiconductor
company
you
don
t
have
to
understand
software
per
se
you
just
have
to
know
how
to
do
thing
right
at
the
time
lucas
approach
him
henley
be
cfo
at
the
real
estate
firm
pacific
holding
company
control
by
the
controversial
entrepreneur
david
murdock
henley
have
work
for
murdock
for
four
and
a
half
year
and
couldn
t
stand
the
guy
he
fear
that
on
the
basis
of
what
he
d
read
ellison
sound
very
similar
to
murdock
murdock
be
a
self
make
guy
much
like
larry
very
opinionated
very
volatile
temper
and
wouldn
t
listen
to
anybody
and
here
s
this
ellison
that
they
say
be
an
egomaniac
and
all
this
other
stuff
so
why
would
i
go
and
work
there
henley
be
won
over
in
december
at
a
dinner
with
ellison
at
the
sofitel
hotel
across
the
road
from
oracle
s
new
emerald
tower
headquarters
henley
say
he
have
clearly
be
in
deep
shock
but
now
he
have
gotten
over
that
and
be
try
to
get
thing
go
he
be
very
concerned
and
as
i
would
later
discover
worried
for
his
own
job
i
found
him
very
resolute
and
commit
to
turn
the
company
around
and
that
he
have
take
a
very
active
role
after
a
number
of
people
in
the
leadership
have
be
fire
he
be
even
signing
all
the
check
in
the
united
state
as
a
way
of
really
try
to
get
his
arm
around
what
be
go
on
but
he
clearly
acknowledge
that
he
need
more
experienced
management
far
from
ellison
s
personality
be
an
obstacle
to
him
henley
want
a
guarantee
that
ellison
would
not
be
force
out
i
didn
t
want
to
join
the
company
and
see
larry
leave
i
found
him
very
different
from
murdock
murdock
thought
he
knew
everything
and
be
in
a
thousand
different
business
but
larry
be
very
focus
on
the
business
of
technology
murdock
have
street
savvy
but
nothing
like
the
intellect
of
larry
murdock
have
no
sense
of
humor
while
larry
have
a
great
sense
of
humor
so
i
saw
a
guy
who
i
could
also
have
a
lot
of
fun
work
with
i
d
be
ten
year
in
the
tech
industry
and
i
come
to
believe
that
most
tech
company
lose
their
way
because
they
don
t
have
leader
who
really
understand
the
technology
but
larry
do
ellison
also
like
henley
a
lot
more
than
he
expect
to
find
in
him
much
more
than
the
kind
of
super
bean
counter
he
fear
be
saddle
with
what
impressed
him
be
henley
s
calm
rationality
although
he
be
only
a
year
or
so
old
than
ellison
in
his
late
forty
with
gray
hair
craggy
feature
and
the
quiet
confidence
that
only
the
truly
well
ground
have
he
have
a
somewhat
senatorial
air
that
be
far
remove
from
the
oracle
of
the
s
henley
also
appreciate
ellison
s
willingness
to
learn
from
his
mistake
he
acknowledge
that
he
have
create
too
much
competition
inside
the
company
he
hadn
t
push
teamwork
enough
so
he
have
a
group
of
people
on
his
executive
team
who
just
hat
each
other
he
also
realize
that
hire
really
smart
people
very
smart
young
engineer
or
whatever
have
to
be
balance
by
bring
in
people
who
have
some
business
experience
the
blowup
make
him
modify
some
view
he
d
held
for
a
long
time
it
be
like
i
have
a
couple
of
blind
spot
and
now
i
need
to

this
be
serious
he
have
his
head
in
the

the
day
henley
walk
in

that

superb
for
the

fast
because
people
could
take
on
job
that
evolve
in
value
very
quickly
when
henley
come
in
he
say
i

than
six
month
from
that
moment
on
i
felt
the

lose
the
incredible
culture
it
have
henley
also
start
chip
away
at
expense
such
as
lavish
party
and
massive
bonus
hashemi
a

who
thought
nothing
of
work
eighteen
or
twenty
hour
a
day
for
her
beloved
oracle
say
that
in
the
past
it
would
have
be
unusual
to
find
an
empty
conference
room
at
nine
in
the

become
a

what
it
have
to
evolve
into
a
more
stable
grown
up

something
may
have
be
lose
in
the
process
of
dial
down
the
manic
intensity
that
have
help
get
oracle
into
trouble
but
not
much
of
it
be
worth
keep
with

to

the
bad

to
have

who
could
build

run
a

the
first
time
ellison
use
the
service
of
a
headhunter
heidrick
struggle
to
identify
candidate
for
mike
field
s
job
as
head
of
oracle
usa
the
two
men
who
be
shortlist
be
a
world
away
from
the
old
oracle
one
be
george
conrades
who
be
run
ibm
s
sale
in
america
and
later
go
on
to
be
the
ceo
of
akamai
the
successful
pioneer
of
web
cache
technology
the
other
be
ray
lane
a
senior
partner
of
the
big
consultancy
firm
booz
allen
hamilton
lane
have
be
at
booz
allen
for
about
twelve
year
and
have
built
its
it
practice
the
information
system
group
into
one
of
the
four
major
line
of
business
within
the
firm
with
the
handsome
feature
and
firm
voice
of
a
film
director
s
idea
of
a
clich
presidential
candidate
and
a
good
opinion
of
himself
to
match
ray
lane
certainly
look
the
part
however
lane
have
to
be
talk
into
see
ellison
by
heidrick
struggle
john
thomson
oddly
lane
have
never
heard
of
ellison
and
knew
next
to
nothing
about
oracle
thomson
suggest
that
even
if
nothing
come
of
meeting
ellison
lane
might
be
able
to
sell
himself
some
consult
work
down
the
road
when
lane
agree
to
fly
to
california
from
his
base
in
dallas
he
decide
to
do
some
research
on
oracle
it
be
all
really
bad
i
remember
one
article
in
upside
magazine
which
have
larry
portrayed
as
don
quixote
tilt
at
windmill
and
there
be
others
about
the
demise
of
oracle
and
its
near
bankruptcy
frankly
i
didn
t
know
why
i
be
go
to
meet
him
but
i
do
and
i
spent
three
hour
with
him
talk
more
at
each
other
than
have
a
conversation
about
eighty
percent
of
the
discussion
be
my
view
of
how
company
don
t
understand
how
to
use
computer
technology
and
what
they
need
to
be
do
he
kept
on
talk
about
the
technology
so
at
the
end
we
be
really
fire
each
other
up
in
different
dimension
talk
about
the
same
thing
but
look
at
both
side
of
the
elephant
he
want
somebody
who
understood
what
the
technology
do
for
customer
and
who
could
sell
solution
finally
it
get
to
the
point
after
two
hour
when
he
say
you
re
the
guy
you
re
exactly
what
we
re
look
for
will
you
do
this
although
lane
be
excite
by
ellison
s
pitch
that
the
combination
of
the
forthcoming
oracle
and
a
reform
professional
sale
force
represent
a
great
opportunity
he
played
hard
to
get
claim
that
he
stood
a
good
chance
of
eventually
become
ceo
of
booz
allen
which
compare
with
oracle
be
a
global
and
highly
respect
firm
but
if
lane
be
cautious
ellison
be
convince
larry
triple
the
number
of
option
on
the
spot
and
say
i
could
run
thing
from
dallas
it
s
oracle
usa
not
oracle
california
and
just
turn
up
at
redwood
for
management
meeting
lane
return
to
dallas
without
have
give
ellison
his
answer
and
continued
look
into
the
kind
of
company
he
might
be
join
and
what
work
for
ellison
would
be
like
i
start
talk
to
people
i
could
trust
about
oracle
about
ten
people
in
all
all
but
one
say
that
the
company
be
go
and
the
earth
would
be
well
if
it
be
go
and
everyone
say
larry
couldn
t
be
trust
be
the
scourge
of
the
earth
and
be
legitimately
hat
they
be
say
you
d
be
go
from
a
classy
professional
environment
to
a
bunch
of
wolf
if
you
go
don
t
call
me
i
ll
never
buy
an
oracle
product
even
from
you
i
be
hearing
that
there
be
a
true
love
hate
relationship
with
every
employee
who
work
at
oracle
it
s
an
excite
place
to
work
because
you
re
in
the
middle
of
everything
you
make
good
money
the
sale
force
make
incredible
money
yet
every
day
you
re
die
to
go
home
and
you
re
say
i
hate
this
place
i
hate
this
company
the
one
dissent
voice
be
a
friend
of
lane
s
name
robert
shaw
a
burly
dynamic
ex
marine
who
ran
the
booz
office
in
san
francisco
shaw
who
be
willing
to
back
his
judgment
by
go
with
lane
to
oracle
say
that
he
thought
oracle
have
more
potential
than
any
other
company
in
the
valley
lane
say
i
trust
him
he
knew
something
about
oracle
and
have
work
with
them
in
the
past
he
thought
they
have
just
be
mismanage
larry
be
a
lunatic
but
a
lunatic
with
vision
they
have
kick
as
in
the
s
and
they
could
kick
as
again
robert
be
very
influential
with
me
say
gee
if
you
go
i
m
go
with
you
lane
have
also
more
or
less
convince
himself
that
he
could
work
with
ellison
because
they
be
so
complementary
and
that
ellison
s
propensity
for
delegation
would
result
in
a
degree
of
separation
he
felt
too
an
urge
to
move
to
california
if
you
re
in
the
oil
business
texas
be
the
place
to
be
if
you
re
in
the
computer
business
you
ve
get
to
be
in
california
also
at
the
time
i
be
not
close
to
my
wife
and
we
have
already
talk
about
splitting
up
if
there
be
attraction
in
make
a
new
life
lane
be
candid
enough
to
admit
that
it
be
the
prospect
of
get
rich
that
make
up
his
mind
for
him
speak
of
himself
and
jeff
henley
he
say
i
think
larry
bought
both
of
us
i
think
it
s
an
mo
larry
will
first
charm
you
and
then
he
ll
buy
you
with
three
hundred
thousand
stock
option
he
knew
i
could
do
the
math
and
if
oracle
stock
move
five
point
it
would
be
more
than
i
would
ever
make
at
booz
allen
the
funny
thing
be
that
ellison
be
so
desperate
to
hire
lane
as
geoff
squire
say
if
you
have
do
a
criterion
matrix
you
wouldn
t
have
picked
ray
he
d
never
really
see
software
and
he
d
never
run
an
organization
do
more
than
million
conrades
have
more
tick
on
the
scoreboard
but
he
be
intelligent
a
good
consultant
very
quick
to
understand
thing
i
think
it
be
actually
quite
an
inspire
decision
as
for
lane
whatever
his
initial
doubt
about
join
oracle
his
relationship
with
the
lunatic
ellison
would
be
pivotal
in
create
the
company
that
oracle
become
in
the
s
lane
s
timing
couldn
t
have
be
well
his
first
day
at
oracle
on
june
coincide
with
the
launch
of
oracle
in
new
york
larry
stuck
some
makeup
on
me
and
threw
me
up
on
stage
after
he
have
introduce
oracle
i
ran
a
little
analyst
panel
that
be
to
talk
about
why
they
thought
it
have
the
right
feature
and
how
if
we
deliver
on
time
the
prospect
look
pretty
positive
in
fact
oracle
be
a
little
late
to
ship
and
didn
t
get
out
of
the
door
that
day
but
it
quickly
become
apparent
that
it
be
the
product
that
oracle
s
long
suffer
customer
have
be
wait
four
year
to
get
their
hand
on
ellison
say
simply
oracle
be
a
work
version
of
oracle
plus
a
few
very
important
new
feature
specifically
it
have
all
the
feature
that
sybase
have
differentiate
itself
with
and
more
oracle
have
an
advanced
architecture
and
like
sybase
be
fully
programmable
via
its
elegant
new
pl
sql
program
language
and
oracle
one
upped
sybase
on
both
referential
integrity
and
two
phase
commit
ellison
say
with
sybase
you
have
to
write
hundred
of
line
of
code
in
their
server
program
language
to
get
two
phase
commit
or
referential
integrity
to
work
in
contrast
oracle
implement
both
of
those
feature
use
standard
sql
what
take
hundred
of
line
of
code
in
sybase
we
could
do
with
a
few
keywords
the
two
feature
sybase
have
market
most
heavily
suddenly
become
technical
advantage
for
us
not
them
whereas
sybase
support
neither
standard
sql
query
nor
update
transaction
that
access
data
on
more
than
one
server
oracle
could
automatically
retrieve
and
modify
data
on
multiple
computer
use
standard
sql
even
when
some
of
that
data
be
store
in
the
database
of
rival
vendor
make
it
much
easy
to
build
client
server
application
that
work
with
the
database
than
before
in
addition
oracle
be
much
faster
than
any
other
database
on
the
market
thanks
to
ellison
s
passion
for
the
cluster
and
multiprocessing
technology
that
have
make
its
first
appearance
in
oracle
although
it
would
be
nearly
a
decade
before
the
full
fruit
of
oracle
s
commitment
to
cluster
base
on
the
pioneer
oracle
share
disk
architecture
would
become
evident
in
oracle
i
there
be
already
one
important
marketing
benefit
ellison
say
we
be
the
first
to
use
cluster
in
performance
benchmark
we
won
the
tpc
benchmark
by
such
huge
margin
that
everyone
else
just
give
up
run
on
a
pair
of
unix
server
oracle
support
more
than
ten
thousand
user
and
smash
through
the
thousand
transaction
a
second
barrier
cluster
may
not
yet
have
be
of
much
practical
benefit
to
customer
want
to
run
real
world
application
but
combine
with
oracle
s
other
strength
it
be
to
prove
a
knockout
blow
to
the
like
of
sybase
and
informix
jay
nussbaum
who
have
join
oracle
from
xerox
in
early
sum
up
what
oracle
s
product
superiority
meant
to
the
sale
force
a
dog
with
a
note
in
its
mouth
could
sell
it
technically
apart
from
have
a
great
product
to
sell
ray
lane
be
also
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
of
the
people
he
discover
at
oracle
he
be
expect
to
find
people
who
be
kind
of
average
not
thinker
but
doer
but
everywhere
there
be
a
lot
of
very
creative
people
even
so
lane
resolve
that
if
ellison
didn
t
pas
two
test
in
the
first
few
month
he
would
return
to
booz
the
first
of
these
be
whether
ellison
would
back
him
in
choose
his
executive
team
lane
say
i
have
to
figure
out
who
the
good
apple
and
bad
apple
be
i
fire
about
seven
people
and
one
be
a
particularly
bad
apple
craig
conway
who
s
the
ceo
of
a
big
company
peoplesoft
today
craig
be
a
smart
guy
and
he
be
also
a
friend
of
larry
s
although
lane
at
first
want
conway
on
his
team
he
soon
change
his
mind
he
come
to
the
conclusion
that
conway
have
undermined
the
still
popular
mike
field
by
constantly
feed
ellison
with
poison
about
him
lane
say
poor
mike
be
try
to
sell
a
bad
product
oracle
against
sybase
and
he
be
do
a
great
job
try
to
correct
the
year
of
bad
behavior
with
the
customer
always
out
on
the
road
and
back
at
the
ranch
there
s
craig
say
to
larry
why
don
t
you
give
it
all
to
me
i
ll
make
it
work
he
be
very
smart
very
machiavellian
always
try
to
figure
out
an
angle
and
so
he
get
mike
field
what
convince
lane
to
get
rid
of
conway
be
not
only
the
belief
that
he
be
also
plot
against
him
but
the
ill
feel
against
conway
that
he
found
during
the
annual
company
jamboree
in
hawaii
for
salesperson
who
have
met
their
quota
the
hundred
percent
club
it
be
like
hell
everybody
be
call
my
room
all
the
finger
be
point
at
conway
it
be
such
an
easy
decision
whether
it
would
be
so
easy
for
ellison
be
another
matter
when
lane
told
ellison
what
he
be
go
to
do
ellison
ask
him
whether
he
be
sure
because
he
might
need
some
help
get
through
the
next
couple
of
quarter
lane
say
i
m
very
sure
and
i
want
your
commitment
that
when
he
come
to
you
you
will
either
not
talk
to
him
or
you
ll
tell
him
that
it
s
ray
s
decision
ellison
told
him
he
have
it
and
when
conway
duly
go
to
ellison
and
demand
to
be
put
in
charge
of
something
else
ellison
be
as
good
as
his
word
say
it
s
ray
s
business
to
run
ray
have
to
make
the
call
the
second
test
be
whether
ellison
be
willing
to
listen
and
respond
to
criticism
and
unpalatable
fact
on
his
arrival
lane
have
try
to
find
out
why
oracle
have
be
lose
market
share
to
sybase
and
informix
i
be
just
get
stupid
answer
like
we
never
see
sybase
so
i
hire
mckinsey
to
do
a
study
and
collect
data
on
our
customer
and
business
practice
how
do
deal
get
approve
how
do
the
field
actually
work
how
do
the
customer
actually
feel
why
do
they
feel
so
bad
about
us
i
be
hearing
story
like
customer
would
call
because
the
product
didn
t
work
and
they
would
get
answer
like
bummer
dude
when
i
present
the
mckinsey
study
it
be
the
first
time
anyone
have
present
real
data
now
here
it
be
we
ve
talk
to
hundred
of
customer
and
now
tell
me
we
don
t
lose
to
sybase
tell
me
sybase
be
not
view
as
a
well
company
than
oracle
if
ellison
be
convince
that
version
on
its
own
would
enable
oracle
to
triumph
lane
be
more
skeptical
he
believe
that
i
didn
t
i
think
it
certainly
brought
parity
with
sybase
but
larry
think
that
ninety
percent
of
the
company
s
success
be
make
on
the
product
i
think
the
product
be
really
important
but
oracle
s
problem
be
not
go
to
be
solve
just
because
oracle
come
out
the
mckinsey
survey
show
that
sybase
be
a
beloved
company
all
i
get
be
larry
tell
me
stuff
that
you
know
oracle
get
introduce
and
your
life
be
wonderful
and
it
s
plain
sail
and
all
that
i
would
talk
to
the
sale
force
and
say
why
do
we
lose
they
say
we
never
lose
they
have
no
respect
for
sybase
what
come
back
from
mckinsey
be
that
customer
hat
us
and
sybase
be
revere
as
a
trust
partner
however
confident
ellison
might
have
be
about
the
prospect
for
oracle
he
pass
lane
s
second
test
by
allow
him
a
completely
free
hand
in
reorganize
the
sale
and
support
operation
with
lane
and
henley
on
board
supposedly
provide
the
adult
supervision
that
oracle
have
previously
lack
ellison
felt
free
to
revert
to
his
prefer
role
direct
engineering
he
be
no
more
interested
in
those
part
of
the
company
than
he
have
be
in
the
past
and
be
just
grateful
that
they
now
appear
to
be
in
safe
and
steady
hand
lane
say
he
be
very
helpful
very
supportive
of
what
i
be
do
and
i
be
change
everything
bring
in
a
whole
new
management
team
many
of
them
from
booz
allen
at
the
same
time
as
lane
be
shake
up
sale
his
former
booz
colleague
robert
shaw
who
now
report
to
him
be
determine
to
yank
oracle
s
tiny
consult
operation
out
of
its
torpor
and
turn
it
into
something
much
big
and
more
powerful
on
the
back
of
the
application
that
jeff
walker
have
begin
to
develop
a
few
year
earlier
whereas
database
be
sell
to
the
techie
run
corporate
data
center
sell
application
require
understand
every
aspect
of
a
customer
s
business
shaw
say
i
walk
into
a
two
hundred
person
consult
business
and
probably
a
hundred
ninety
five
of
them
be
the
wrong
people
the
mandate
be
how
do
you
grow
this
how
do
we
get
it
well
integrate
with
the
sale
force
i
take
the
job
because
there
be
a
real
opportunity
to
really
drive
the
customer
proposition
from
a
service
perspective
it
go
from
an
ugly
duckling
lose
a
lot
of
money
do
little
three
day
project
and
customer
complain
about
consultant
just
out
of
training
class
who
think
they
know
more
than
their
own
people
into
by
the
time
i
left
in
a
very
profitable
organization
with
seventeen
thousand
people
and
push
three
billion
dollar
in
revenue
building
a
vast
consult
organization
be
as
strategically
dare
as
it
be
risky
it
would
have
enormous
consequence
both
good
and
bad
for
oracle
the
danger
be
that
if
it
become
a
direct
competitor
to
the
big
five
it
consult
company
it
would
risk
have
its
immature
application
business
cold
shoulder
by
the
firm
who
make
software
choice
on
behalf
of
their
client
in
favor
of
the
much
well
establish
sap
and
the
promising
new
kid
on
the
block
the
client
server
focus
peoplesoft
on
the
other
hand
oracle
have
come
to
recognize
that
develop
and
sell
apps
be
very
different
from
the
database
business
and
have
its
own
consult
operation
be
a
way
to
gain
the
skill
it
need
to
succeed
shaw
say
that
in
his
first
year
the
decision
be
revisit
many
time
larry
come
to
me
when
we
reach
the
first
milestone
for
us
which
be
when
we
do
a
hundred
million
dollar
we
be
probably
celebrate
and
we
thought
we
d
just
really
pull
a
coup
and
larry
s
reaction
be
do
you
think
you
could
ever
make
this
large
than
andersen
consult
i
say
i
doubt
it
but
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
be
think
the
next
plateau
be
become
a
billion
dollar
business
and
then
a
multibillion
dollar
business
larry
be
always
insightful
he
say
look
at
the
evolutionary
state
of
a
set
of
our
product
arrogantly
you
can
think
that
we
don
t
really
need
to
listen
to
the
customer
on
the
database
because
we
know
more
about
database
technology
than
they
do
so
you
can
really
drive
the
requirement
internally
towards
the
external
market
but
when
it
come
to
application
the
user
knew
a
lot
more
about
the
functionality
they
need
to
run
their
business
and
at
the
stage
we
be
at
of
try
to
integrate
the
core
database
technology
with
the
development
tool
and
then
add
application
on
top
of
that
larry
say
this
be
go
to
be
a
mess
to
manage
if
i
also
have
to
integrate
with
a
bunch
of
system
integrator
and
have
them
bother
my
development
organization
they
ll
slow
down
the
implementation
of
project
because
they
re
not
serve
a
single
master
they
re
serve
whatever
they
can
generate
service
around
so
i
think
larry
and
i
and
ray
basically
make
the
decision
we
re
go
to
go
for
it
we
ll
be
channel
friendly
as
long
as
the
channel
bring
the
business
but
if
the
channel
be
just
look
for
us
to
hand
off
all
system
integration
business
without
help
us
influence
it
we
re
probably
not
interested
would
a
third
party
really
invest
the
time
to
learn
our
product
or
would
it
slow
us
down
in
term
of
penetrate
account
with
our
application
we
have
so
many
people
question
either
their
functionality
or
the
integration
of
the
technology
that
we
decide
to
cover
ourselves
and
build
the
business
ourselves
so
the
decision
be
let
s
go
build
a
very
successful
consult
business
around
that
nine
month
after
ray
lane
s
arrival
oracle
manage
to
beat
analyst
expectation
for
the
traditionally
tough
third
quarter
of
its
fiscal
year
bring
in
revenue
of
million
and
nearly
double
net
income
over
the
previous
year
to
million
lane
say
the
message
be
start
to
get
out
that
we
be
serious
about
serve
customer
we
d
ship
the
product
oracle
not
empty
box
international
run
by
geoff
squire
be
do
well
average
growth
number
but
with
great
profitability
people
be
say
that
it
look
like
a
turnaround
be
in
progress
and
that
s
all
you
need
to
move
the
stock
the
day
we
announce
the
q
the
stock
bounce
eight
point
from
fifteen
dollar
to
twenty
three
the
message
be
that
oracle
have
turn
the
corner
lane
s
gamble
have
already
paid
off
financially
i
be
in
the
game
and
after
the
first
year
i
thought
i
can
do
this
it
s
go
to
be
a
good
ride
lane
s
focus
continued
to
be
on
bring
order
discipline
and
a
service
ethic
to
the
sale
force
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
he
felt
confident
enough
to
change
all
the
compensation
plan
the
two
big
change
he
make
be
to
insist
that
the
sale
organization
should
not
be
paid
extra
for
service
and
to
change
the
quota
for
individual
salesperson
in
relation
to
the
size
of
their
account
they
be
say
to
me
if
you
want
service
ray
if
you
want
us
to
be
good
guy
then
pay
us
for
be
good
guy
i
say
no
that
s
something
that
come
with
your
dna
when
i
come
in
say
lane
i
also
found
that
all
the
quota
be
the
same
everyone
have
a
two
million
dollar
quota
even
the
guy
at
general
motor
the
list
price
of
all
the
oracle
product
he
could
sell
to
gm
would
probably
come
to
two
hundred
million
or
more
he
could
say
if
you
buy
the
whole
book
i
ll
discount
at
ninety
percent
with
a
twenty
million
dollar
deal
and
a
two
million
dollar
quota
he
make
a
lot
of
money
and
the
cio
that
buy
the
stuff
be
a
hero
so
the
salesman
leaf
oracle
because
he
can
t
sell
anything
more
have
sell
the
whole
book
meanwhile
the
customer
be
say
what
can
i
do
with
all
this
crap
we
have
thousand
of
customer
in
that
situation
so
i
customize
the
quota
for
potential
and
a
lot
of
the
cowboy
left
i
knew
i
would
drive
them
out
now
if
you
ve
get
gm
you
re
go
to
get
a
ten
million
dollar
quota
you
re
go
to
sign
up
to
stay
and
you
re
not
go
to
be
allow
to
sell
everything
in
the
price
book
in
one
deal
ellison
couldn
t
have
be
happier
with
lane
s
impact
on
the
company
he
have
brought
in
other
senior
manager
from
booz
allen
as
well
as
a
number
from
ed
and
ibm
who
be
a
different
specie
from
kennedy
s
pack
dog
and
who
have
precisely
the
effect
on
the
field
that
ellison
have
hop
jenny
overstreet
say
larry
be
just
totally
jazzed
to
have
ray
and
jeff
henley
around
to
teach
him
about
what
happen
in
grown
up
company
in
fact
ellison
be
so
thrill
by
lane
s
performance
and
the
impression
of
gravitas
he
lent
the
company
that
when
lane
begin
to
suggest
take
on
more
responsibility
he
didn
t
hesitate
to
give
it
to
him
ellison
say
ray
have
do
a
great
job
in
the
u
s
so
when
he
ask
for
more
responsibility
i
give
it
to
him
the
problem
be
i
give
him
too
much
too
fast
ray
go
from
run
u
s
sale
to
run
global
sale
in
october
that
be
mistake
number
one
i
remove
geoff
squire
from
run
oracle
europe
that
be
mistake
number
two
then
i
give
ray
customer
support
that
be
mistake
number
three
the
rapidly
expand
consult
organization
run
by
robert
shaw
also
report
to
lane
when
lane
have
arrive
at
oracle
his
position
if
anything
have
be
slightly
beneath
those
of
jeff
henley
and
geoff
squire
lane
however
bear
no
responsibility
for
the
fire
of
squire
which
ellison
now
so
bitterly
regret
the
two
men
get
on
well
from
the
outset
despite
ellison
s
have
typically
fail
to
explain
clearly
to
either
who
be
the
other
s
bos
squire
who
have
move
back
to
london
after
the
company
have
stabilize
say
that
he
would
have
be
happy
to
work
for
lane
know
that
management
of
global
sale
would
at
some
time
revert
to
the
united
state
but
ellison
have
other
idea
meeting
ellison
for
what
he
expect
to
be
a
routine
session
over
breakfast
in
a
london
hotel
squire
kick
off
his
to
do
list
with
some
senior
appointment
he
have
be
wait
for
ellison
s
approval
on
ellison
say
ah
yes
that
s
what
i
want
to
discus
with
you
we
won
t
be
need
them
ray
be
take
over
international
squire
say
i
then
ask
him
what
he
want
me
to
do
he
didn
t
say
anything
and
it
be
about
five
to
ten
and
i
have
another
meeting
to
go
to
he
look
uncomfortable
so
i
say
you
re
surely
not
you
don
t
want
me
in
the
company
he
nod
and
i
say
that
s
ridiculous
and
i
left
him
there
after
that
it
get
silly
with
lawyer
look
back
on
it
now
ellison
say
remove
geoff
squire
from
oracle
europe
be
the
mother
of
all
the
management
mistake
i
make
that
year
geoff
be
probably
the
most
talented
field
executive
we
ve
ever
have
at
oracle
he
prove
just
how
good
he
be
by
building
veritas
out
of
an
acquire
amalgam
of
tech
company
flotsam
and
jetsam
geoff
be
an
extraordinarily
gift
guy
and
i
fire
him
ugh
within
two
year
ray
lane
be
not
only
very
clearly
ellison
s
number
two
but
be
in
practice
run
far
more
of
the
business
than
his
bos
from
ellison
s
point
of
view
it
meant
that
he
be
able
to
spend
most
of
his
time
do
what
he
like
best
lead
the
developer
in
the
database
and
the
tool
group
it
be
also
good
timing
because
ellison
s
cofounder
bob
miner
have
quit
his
development
role
at
the
end
of
he
be
unsuited
to
manage
the
big
team
of
engineer
that
oracle
by
now
employ
and
be
fed
up
with
the
unrelenting
pressure
to
meet
product
deadline
thing
have
come
to
a
head
at
one
of
the
monday
management
committee
meeting
over
the
release
date
of
oracle
and
ray
lane
have
bang
the
table
in
frustration
ellison
recall
in
the
meeting
i
ask
bob
to
commit
to
a
date
for
oracle
he
wouldn
t
provide
a
date
i
kept
ask
finally
bob
get
angry
and
threw
a
crumple
up
piece
of
paper
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
say
okay
there
s
your
fuck
schedule
the
room
go
silent
after
a
long
pause
bob
say
everyone
be
work
their
as
off
it
s
do
when
it
s
do
that
even
bob
call
me
at
home
and
say
look
i
m
go
to
make
it
easy
for
you
i
m
go
to
let
derry
run
database
development
bob
knew
i
would
never
take
him
out
of
his
job
so
bob
do
it
himself
a
year
later
miner
be
diagnose
with
lung
cancer
and
a
year
after
that
he
be
dead
ellison
say
of
him
oracle
change
a
lot
of
people
but
not
bob
miner
he
never
bought
a
new
house
he
never
bought
a
fancy
car
or
boat
he
never
ever
change
he
never
get
swept
away
by
ambition
the
departure
and
death
of
miner
affected
ellison
personally
but
without
him
the
little
group
miner
have
take
off
to
san
francisco
disband
and
return
to
oracle
mainly
to
the
database
group
one
of
them
be
ed
screven
who
have
previously
work
with
jeff
walker
bob
be
an
incredibly
smart
guy
with
great
technical
intuition
we
be
try
to
build
a
kind
of
next
generation
application
execution
environment
we
have
a
lot
of
good
idea
and
it
be
fun
but
we
didn
t
make
much
progress
it
be
just
way
too
ambitious
as
for
ellison
despite
a
fair
amount
of
turmoil
in
his
personal
life
see
chapter
and
have
survive
a
couple
of
near
death
experience
of
his
own
between
the
end
of
and
the
middle
of
he
have
manage
to
break
his
neck
while
body
surf
in
hawaii
and
smash
one
of
his
elbow
when
his
front
bicycle
wheel
stuck
in
a
disused
railway
track
while
he
be
career
downhill
near
napa
he
be
fully
focus
on
propel
oracle
clear
of
the
pack
of
other
database
vendor
his
strategy
rest
on
three
leg
the
first
and
most
important
be
achieve
real
product
superiority
over
sybase
and
informix
oracle
s
main
rival
in
the
early
s
with
the
release
of
oracle
and
in
particular
version
in
oracle
have
for
the
first
time
in
several
year
unambiguously
the
best
database
on
the
market
the
second
be
in
some
way
a
repeat
of
what
have
work
for
oracle
in
the
s
when
ingres
have
be
the
target
ellison
be
determine
to
exploit
the
strength
of
oracle
by
building
market
share
no
matter
what
the
cost
ray
lane
believe
that
ellison
s
obsession
with
growth
may
have
be
one
of
the
factor
behind
his
sack
geoff
squire
although
europe
be
extremely
profitable
it
be
not
grow
fast
enough
for
ellison
the
country
manager
appoint
by
squire
to
run
subsidiary
such
as
michel
rocher
in
france
have
considerable
autonomy
and
some
of
them
prefer
slow
growth
and
big
profit
lane
say
larry
be
constantly
say
he
want
well
number
out
of
france
out
of
europe
he
be
say
that
we
be
lose
market
share
to
sybase
every
day
in
france
and
he
didn
t
care
how
profitable
france
be
i
told
him
larry
if
we
do
this
ramp
up
growth
we
ll
need
to
hire
more
salesman
really
saturate
the
market
but
we
re
go
to
have
a
profitability
problem
he
say
i
don
t
give
a
shit
about
profit
i
want
to
beat
sybase
so
that
s
what
we
do
it
didn
t
take
long
to
work
lane
remembers
during
a
trip
to
london
in
early
ellison
get
him
out
of
bed
at
three
in
the
morning
to
deliver
the
news
that
sybase
have
badly
miss
its
quarter
he
just
say
it
s
over
he
be
the
happiest
i
d
ever
know
him
they
never
never
recover
then
it
be
informix
i
remember
we
broke
informix
in
about
a
year
and
half
we
have
more
salesperson
we
go
for
their
key
account
and
we
make
sure
that
we
never
lose
on
price
tellingly
the
bonus
scheme
that
ellison
lane
and
henley
share
in
be
base
on
one
thing
market
share
if
oracle
be
grow
at
twice
the
rate
of
sybase
the
bonus
would
be
double
lane
recall
the
year
informix
hit
the
wall
the
bonus
get
multiply
time
thirty
three
but
of
course
the
board
couldn
t
let
that
happen
larry
have
to
have
an
enemy
larry
s
the
most
focus
individual
i
ve
ever
see
when
he
have
something
to
beat
the
third
leg
of
the
strategy
be
for
oracle
to
be
increasingly
see
as
more
than
just
a
maker
of
database
ellison
s
interest
in
massively
parallel
processing
mpp
or
cluster
technology
as
it
be
also
know
be
as
strong
as
ever
it
have
help
deliver
the
crush
benchmark
performance
figure
that
oracle
s
marketing
machine
have
blitz
the
opposition
with
but
ellison
believe
that
it
might
have
another
application
that
could
take
oracle
into
a
very
different
world
from
the
corporate
compute
engine
room
that
have
be
its
sole
habitat
up
to
that
point
in
the
early
s
there
be
grow
excitement
about
the
perceive
convergence
among
the
telecommunication
medium
and
compute
industry
the
idea
be
that
the
telephone
and
cable
company
would
build
incredibly
high
capacity
fiber
optic
network
replace
old
twist
copper
wire
and
primitive
one
way
broadcast
cable
system
the
computer
firm
would
come
up
with
way
to
move
data
from
one
end
of
the
network
to
another
at
high
speed
and
convert
bit
of
information
into
high
quality
stream
sound
and
picture
the
television
company
and
the
film
studio
would
digitize
their
huge
program
library
and
develop
interactive
and
transactive
content
with
retail
and
financial
service
partner
the
killer
application
many
believe
would
be
video
on

vod
and
home
shopping
the
whole
caboodle
go
by
the
name
of
the
information
superhighway
and
everyone
it
seem
want
to
be
a
part
of
it
include
larry
ellison
ellison
reckon
that
he
have
at
his
disposal
a
number
of
the
piece
that
be
need
to
make
the
information
superhighway
and
vod
in
particular
possible
the
two
asset
ellison
control
be
the
lead
relational
database
management
system
and
a
majority
stake
in
a
silicon
valley
base
computer
hardware
company
call
ncube
which
he
have
acquire
in
for
around
million

bob

have
put

million
ellison
maintain
that
oracle
should
never
go
into
hardware
itself
because
it
must
always
be
see
to
be
platform
agnostic
ncube
have
be
start
five
year
earlier
by
some
engineer
from
intel
and
it
be
an
early
leader
in
building
massively
parallel
computer
relatively
compact
machine
with
multiple
processor
and
the
ability
to
calculate
far
faster
than
conventional
mainframe
ellison
hop
that
one
day
an
ultrareliable
version
of
the
oracle
database
would
run
on
the
ncube
box
it
be
partly
his
belief
in
mpp
as
the
way
of
the
future
that
have
result
in
the
rewrite
of
oracle
with
all
the
consequent
problem
of
lateness
and
chronic
unreliability
unfortunately
the
ncube
machine
be
very
tricky
and
time
consume
to
program
which
make
them
unsuitable
for
the
rough
and
tumble
of
corporate
compute
but
ellison
realize
that
it
might
be
possible
to
use
them
for
the
much
more
specialized
task
of
serve
up
stream
video
what
attract
ellison
to
video
on
demand
be
not
just
the
possibility
of
be
able
to
sell
more
software
and
finally
make
some
money
from
ncube
but
the
opportunity
to
link
oracle
with
something
that
everybody
be
talk
about
and
that
be
more
glamorous
and
consumer
orient
than
oracle
s
usual
business
ellison
say
vod
have
become
very
fashionable
the
technical
problem
present
by
vod
be
move
very
large
amount
of
data
all
those
bit
that
make
up
the
movie
image
off
disk
and
onto
the
net
fast
enough
the
performance
bottleneck
be
the
video
server
computer
s
memory
system
but
if
you
have
multiple
memory
as
you
have
with
a
massively
parallel
machine
then
you
have
all
the
bandwidth
you
need
for
vod
problem
solve
so
we
set
off
to
build
the
software
for
a
massively
parallel
video
server
in
ellison
co
opt
a
team
of
some
of
his
brightest
young
engineer
to
solve
the
technical
problem
of
building
a
medium
server
that
could
handle
video
audio
and
text
on
the
ncube
platform
within
a
few
month
they
succeed
how
much
the
software
have
to
do
with
oracle
s
database
technology
be
debatable
but
at
least
the
share
disk
approach
to
architecture
that
have
make
oracle
so
hard
to
finish
finally
come
into
its
own
by
january
the
technology
be
sufficiently
stable
to
be
roll
out
at
an
event
host
by
walter
cronkite
at
the
cbs
studio
in
hollywood
ellison
be
already
experience
a
degree
of
limelight
that
didn
t
normally
come
with
sell
database
he
met
entertainment
mogul
such
as
michael
eisner
of
disney
rupert
murdoch
and
barry
diller
and
also
make
his
first
appearance
on
the
cover
of
fortune
magazine
the
accompany
article
by
alan
deutschman
gratifyingly
entitle
software
s
other
billionaire
be
in
marked
contrast
to
the
kind
of
press
that
ellison
have
be
get
only
a
couple
of
year
earlier
best
of
all
be
the
picture
show
ellison
in
the
japanese
garden
of
his
home
in
atherton
surround
by
lot
of
little
television
set
the
message
couldn
t
have
be
clearer
or
well
for
oracle
here
be
the
man
who
be
make
the
dream
of
video
on
demand
into
reality
be
it
all
a
dazzle
digression
from
oracle
s
real
business
a
bit
like
the
network
computer
that
be
still
to
come
marc
benniof
strongly
disagrees
with
both
the
network
computer
and
the
video
server
you
can
see
a
very
important
part
of
the
way
larry
think
about
thing
he
will
create
a
strategy
that
elevates
oracle
and
also
destabilizes
a
competitor
in
one
movement
it
s
like
the
martial
art
of
business
he
s
very
good
at
this
the
video
server
strengthen
oracle
because
it
make
people
much
more
aware
of
oracle
the
oracle
brand
and
larry
the
visionary
after
the
fortune
article
there
be
a
bunch
of
other
piece
all
say
the
same
kind
of
thing
it
not
only
drove
people
to
oracle
all
the
competitor
be
go
crazy
say
gee
what
should
we
do
microsoft
have
to
respond
and
so
do
silicon
graphic
which
be
very
hot
in
those
day
and
the
other
database
company
they
don
t
even
know
what
s
happen
to
their
own
psychology
when
larry
be
out
there
do
his
stuff
the
glitzy
presentation
of

s
all
sing
all
dance
vod
technology
at
cbs
didn
t
go
quite
as
plan
but
not
because
of
the
gremlin
that
traditionally
conspire
to
undermine
carefully
rehearse
tech
demo
at
on
the
morning
of
the

a
powerful

ellison

people
be
pound
on
my

tell
me
to
get
out
of
the

because
of
the
earthquake
i
told
them
to
go
the
hell
away
so
i
could
go
back
to
sleep
i
have
already
be
awaken
by
a
huge
crash
in
my
room
follow
by
what
sound
like
a
series
of
gunshot
come
from
the
bathroom
i
didn
t
care
i
want
to
be
well
rest
for
the
presentation
the
next
morning
i
go
back
to
sleep
the
next
morning
i
discover
what
cause
the
noise
in
my
room
the
gunshot
be
ceramic
tile
explode
off
the
bathroom
wall
as
the

swayed
back
and
forth
the
big
crash
be
the
armoire
with
the
big
screen

fall
face
first
onto
the
floor
maybe
it
be
also
an
omen
the
demo
have
to
be
postpone
because
cronkite
be
pull
out
to
work
on
the
earthquake
unlike
the
television
in
ellison

vod
go
out
with
a
whimper
rather
than
a

it
wasn

however
because

perfectly
as

have
promise
it
would
although
the
ncube

be
expensive
because
of
their
proprietary

people
also
like
the

a
lot
and
be
prepared
to
buy
some
of
their

on
a

in

the
most
popular

the

thus
enable

unfortunately
they
weren

spending
enough
either
on

or
on
the
primitive
online
shopping
that
be
also
provide
to
give
the
telco
any
confidence
that
they
would
get
a
return
if
they
spent
billion
building
out
the

ellison
say
it

really

look
back
on
it
we
all
believe
this

go

bill

even
write
a
book
about
it
i
thought
i
be
so
smart
figure
out
how
to
use
a
massively

to
solve
the
vod
technical
problem
unfortunately
the
barrier
turn
out
to
be
economic
not
technical
consumer
be
unwilling
to
pay
very
much
for

and
the
market
for
training

be
too
small
to
make
up
for
it
it
didn

matter
how
good
our

be
it
just
didn
t
make

sense
to
spend

through

bt
say
it
might
mean
the
difference
between
spending

and
well
over

the
second
be
the
imminent
arrival
of

nothing

the
real

but
the
telco
boss
be
worried
that
a
lot
of
people
would
think
it
good
enough
finally
there

from
the

i
found
jeff
very
easy
to
work
with
he
say
exactly
what
he
think
he
have
no
personal
agenda
at
all
he
s
fiercely
loyal
to
the
company
he
look
out
for
the
interest
of
our
shareholder
employee

customer
and
he
s
a
leader
as
they
say
in
the
military
it
s
be
an
honor
to
serve
with
him
le
writes
i
thought
then
and
still
believe
that
a
good
consult
manager
be
ideally
suit
to
sell
complex
software
product
ray
could
sell
the
business

of
our

that
s
what
we
need
to
do
more
of
in
our
field
organization
and
of
course
ray
could
improve
our
consult

delivery
he
be
the
right
guy
for
the
job
le

robert
shaw
be
a
great
addition
to

he
deserves
most
of
the
credit
for
building
our
consult
organization
in
the
united

he
s
also
a
pretty
good
sailor

i
don
t
think
craig
be
or
be
as
ray
put
it
a
bad
apple
the
fact
that
craig
manage
a
turnaround
at
peoplesoft

he
s
a
very
capable
software

him
le

i
didn

agree
with
ray

decision
but
i
didn

overrule
it
ray
have
to
build
a

team
he
be
comfortable
with
it

clear
that

le

interestingly
enough
the

eventually
wore
ray
down
and
he
start

it

fascinate
watch

best

when
ray

arrive
at

in
the
middle
of
the
still
relatively
young
application
business
that
jeff
walker
have
found
six
year
earlier
be
grow
fast
its
first
product
might
have
be
thin
on
feature
and
bug
infest
but
by
the
early
s
oracle
have
nearly
customer
make
up
of
mainly
fairly
small
or
midtier
american
company
run
their
financial
human
resource
and
manufacturing
package
without
too
many
complaint
lane
say
walker
be
brilliant
he
create
some
very
innovative
thing
in
those
application
and
he
use
oracle
s
technology
well
than
either
sap
or
peoplesoft
the
customer
be
happy
they
like
the
innovation
and
they
bought
them
because
they
be
open
system
whereas
every
other
application
company
s
at
the
time
be
all
close
and
proprietary
run
on
mainframe
or
minicomputer
what
lane
meant
by
open
be
that
oracle
s
apps
be
built
on
the
unix
operating
system
and
on
the
relational
database
two
major
differentiator
from
the
competition
that
moreover
a
sale
force
use
to
sell
database
understood
and
felt
comfortable
talk
about
lane
believe
that
these
quality
combine
with
the
rapidly
expand
consult
organization
that
robert
shaw
now
have
a
mandate
from
ellison
to
build
would
ensure
grow
success
for
oracle
s
application
there
be
a
lot
rid
on
it
give
that
nearly
everyone
at
redwood
shore
even
ellison
to
some
extent
believe
that
the
database
market
be
fast
mature
oracle
might
never
get
back
to
double
its
revenue
each
year
and
it
be
too
big
for
that
anyway
with
sale
run
at
billion
for
the
fiscal
year
but
the
combination
of
application
and
consult
would
ensure
that
oracle
recover
and
held
on
to
its
status
and
its
stock
rating
as
a
growth
company
however
for
anyone
who
want
to
look
problem
be
already
begin
to
build
up
in
application
unlike
ellison
on
the
database
side
of
development
walker
have
not
stuck
to
a
policy
of
hire
only
the
best
and
brightest
ellison
say
jeff
want
people
who
be
totally
loyal
to
him
and
his
idea
that
make
it
hard
for
him
to
hold
on
to
the
best
people
ed
screven
who
work
with
walker
say
that
he
be
a
bully
who
have
favorite
while
pick
others
out
for
vilification
i
mean
the
guy
literally
make
them
cry
the
consequence
be
that
when
walker
be
fire
he
fail
to
leave
much
talent
behind
him
screven
say
we
have
a
series
of
very
poor
manager
who
be
no
good
at
building
a
competent
engineering
organization
part
of
walker
s
legacy
that
store
up
trouble
for
the
future
be
that
he
implement
his
own
tool
oracle
s
own
tool
operation
under
sohaib
abbasi
be
concentrate
on
go
after
the
market
for
building
customize
application
for
the
database
in
other
word
abbasi
be
create
tool
to
leverage
the
database
as
it
evolve
from
host
base
compute
to
client
server
while
the
tool
in
application
be
stuck
without
a
migration
path
to
the
new
platform
the
consequence
be
that
oracle
s
application
be
not
rewrite
to
run
in
client
server
mode
until
and
even
then
oracle
s
tool
prove
extremely
difficult
to
adapt
to
the
kind
of
graphical
user
interface
gui
that
peoplesoft
be
make
popular
and
that
customer
expect
to
find
on
their
window
desktop
pc
to
make
matter
bad
in
ellison
and
abbasi
have
take
a
fateful
decision
to
extend
oracle
s
portability
proposition
to
support
as
development
platform
a
wide
variety
of
emerge
graphical
user
interface
the
list
include
window
apple
s
macintosh
ibm
s
o
presentation
manager
osf
s
motif
and
sun
s
ultimate
the
decision
be
base
partly
on
what
have
work
for
oracle
in
the
past
and
partly
on
not
want
to
give
too
much
of
a
help
hand
to
microsoft
by
bet
more
strongly
on
window
however
as
abbasi
say
the
pressure
be
on
me
to
deliver
technology
that
would
enable
portable
user
interface
but
it
be
much
more
difficult
than
we
expect
and
original
estimate
be
off
by
two
or
three
year
but
by
then
the
market
have
already
determine
that
window
would
be
the
dominant
gui
it
end
up
be
a
very
expensive
decision
what
both
of
these
costly
mistake
show
be
that
oracle
s
technology
development
be
be
driven
almost
entirely
by
the
requirement
of
the
database
rather
than
the
application
business
not
surprisingly
as
by
his
own
admission
ellison
be
barely
think
about
what
be
need
to
help
application
he
admits
i
paid
no
attention
to
the
going
on
in
application
i
be
a
disinterested
bystander
the
truth
be
that
ellison
found
application
and
the
mainly
clerical
function
that
the
software
of
the
time
be
design
to
automate
unspeakably
dull
compare
with
the
intellectual
purity
of
the
mathematics
and
physic
that
be
at
the
heart
of
database
development
never
mind
the
glitz
of
hollywood
and
interactive
television
ellison
s
neglect
meant
that
oracle
s
application
be
in
no
shape

from

a
disaster
ray
lane

change
the
game
although
we

have
some
success
in
that
area
we
weren

really
an
application
company
our
sale
force
and
our
consultant
didn
t
really
understand
how
to
compete
in
the
application
business
they
have
be
able
to
sell
say
open
and
relational
just
like
when
they
sell
database
but
when
r
come
along
it
take
that
advantage
away
we
now
have
to
fight
on
a
different
battleground
and
that
be
business
functionality
no
contest
we
didn
t
even
come
close
against
sap
we
be
a
fraction
so
we
go
on
what
turn
into
a
four
year
binge
to
try
and
catch
up
with

through
to
our
entire
application

devote
to
try
to
build
the

realize
from
the

that
compete
against
sap
would
be
very
difficult
sap
have
slowly
spread
from
its

european
country

it

able
at
a
stroke
to
double
its
potential

it
be
the
other
way
around

say
we
didn
t
have
italian
accounting

or
german
manufacturing
to
double
our

size
we
have
to
go
to
twenty
seven
different

in

nor
be
it
just
a
case

face
be
left
scrabble
for
small
customer
which
be
now
in
sap
s
sight
because
unlike
r
which
could
run
only
on
mainframe
r
would
work
on
just
about
any
computer
nor
do

really
understand
just
how
different
the

from

the
oracle

how

therefore
what

not
it

to
the

a
great
deal
of
knowledge
about
integrate

ellison
believe
strongly
then
as
he
do
now
that
for
plenty
of

the
direct
model
in
which
a

take
responsibility
for
building
a

be
attractive
however
even
by
it

that

significant
cost

jeff
henley
say
we
totally
screw
up
partner
by
building
this
big
consult
group
we
totally
piss
off
our
partner
ellison
as
he
do
so
often
claim
na
vet
i
wasn
t
aware
of
how
important
the
consult
company
be
in
recommend
application
because
they
weren
t
very
important
make
recommendation
in
the
database
market
i
didn
t
understand
that
building
a
big
consult
business
be
make
it
much
harder
for
us
to
sell
our
application
so
i
support
building
up
our
consult
business
while
sap
be
off
building
alliance
we
make
very
little
effort
to
work
with
consult
partner
robert
shaw
unsurprisingly
see
it
differently
sap
obviously
make
the
decision
to
go
the
other
way
from
us
with
consult
but
you
ve
get
to
remember
they
be
start
from
a
company
that
s
twenty
year
old
in
the
business
of
application
i
think
we
lose
some
market
share
and
penetration
to
sap
because
the
partner
didn
t
recommend
our
product
but
at
the
same
time
our
product
wasn
t
ready
for
the
fortune
world
that
they
inhabit
it
didn
t
have
the
globalization
and
a
lot
of
the
functionality
it
take
so
we
be
probably
well
off
lose
that
work
at
the
same
time
as
sap
grow
and
we
grow
i
think
they
come
to
be
so
dependent
on
the
system
integrator
that
they
be
unable
to
compete
with
us
when
we
move
to
rapid
implementation
and
single
point
of
accountability
ellison
s
response
to
the
threat
from
sap
be
to
appoint
thirty
three
year
old
ron
wohl
to
clean
up
the
mess
inside
application
and
produce
a
package
that
would
stand
comparison
with
r
and
peoplesoft
s
successful
hr
and
financial
package
he
knew
that
it
would
not
be
easy
but
he
have
no
idea
what
a
bed
of
nail
he
be
consign
his
prot
g
to
ellison
however
have
huge
faith
in
wohl
s
ability
he
have
handle
the
complicate
negotiation
with
nippon
steel
with
calmness
and
intelligence
since
then
he
have
operate
as
ellison
s
chief
of
staff
and
despite
often
have
to
play
the
difficult
role
of
go
between
he
be
recognize
as
technically
very
smart
straight
to
deal
with
and
utterly
loyal
to
ellison
ellison
believe
that
wohl
could
build
the
kind
of
application
development
team
oracle
need
if
it
be
to
compete
effectively
with
sap
one
that
be
both
discipline
and
talented
the
only
problem
be
that
wohl
knew
very
little
about
the
application
business
when
ellison
told
the
rest
of
the
company
that
he
be
put
wohl
in
charge
there
be
consternation
and
then
anger
ray
lane
say
when
larry
put
ron
in
charge
of
application
all
of
us
be
just
shock
he
d
never
run
a
large
organization
never
do
any
development
of
any
consequence
he
be
a
smart
guy
but
he
knew
nothing
about
application
didn
t
know
our
product
because
he
d
live
with
larry
he
be
kind
of
a
think
guy
very
seldom
do
software
company
succeed
when
they
try
and
build
a
second
front
a
second

second

this
be
go

big
play
by
the

so
i
say
ron

i
don
t

i
be
probably
negative
from

very

over

who

in

when
the

mid

the

the
factional
warfare

begin

get
out

robert
shaw
say
the
consult
business
be
there
first
and
foremost
to
drive
product
adoption
and
to
have
expert
on

who
knew
the
product
and
could
get
the
stuff
to
work
well
quicker
than
outside
consult
firm
but
what
be
not
there
from
the
begin
be
a
good
interface
between
consult
and
development
to
get
product
issue
and
future
requirement
from

back
into

organization
the

the
number
of

in
the

be
uncovered
by
the

be
just
overwhelm
it
be
almost
catastrophic
we
be
always
the
one
that
found
the
problem
that
would
embarrass
development
we
be
always
on
their
case
because
we
want
relief
in
our
budget
because
we
be
spending
so
much
time
building
around
the
product
to
make
it
work
in
a
customer
site
it
didn
t
take
long
for
ray
lane
to
lose
patience
with
wohl
completely
i
go
to
ron
one
day
and
i
say
that
i
have
finally
have
it
and
that
i
be
go
to
go
to
larry
and
recommend
he
take
him
out
of
the
job
i
say
to
him
that
i
d
never
stab
him
in
the
back
but
i
would
stab
in
the
chest
ron
didn
t
say
anything
except
okay
fine
it
be
like
i
think
you
re
kind
of
crazy
for
do
it
because
i
know
larry
love
me
if
that
s
what
wohl
be
think
he
be
right
it
wouldn
t
be
the
last
time
that
lane
would
try
to
get
wohl
fire
it
be
the
begin
of
a
war
of
attrition
between
the
two
men
that
would
last
for
year
however
it
wasn
t
in
lane
s
nature
to
accept
what
he
felt
be
an
intolerable
situation
if
development
under
wohl
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
produce
the
weapon
to
make
the
fight
with
sap
more
equal
lane
s
side
of
the
company
would
come
up
with
an
answer
of
its
own
the
idea
come
from
shaw
s
hard
charge
consult
operation
shaw
say
we
d
make
the
first
step
of
training
the
sale
force
on
how
to
sell
solution
then
at
the
next
level
when
we
start
compete
for
the
major
account
with
sap
it
become
obvious
that
if
say
you
re
go
to
a
major
oil
company
you
d
well
have
somebody
who
know
how
an
oil
company
work
and
can
talk
about
the
issue
the
same
with
a
pharmaceutical
company
or
any
of
the
retail
process
industry
so
larry
and
ray
give
me
the
task
of
building
a
sale
force
that
could
compete
more
successfully
and
aggressively
by
vertical
market
with
sap
apart
from
manufacturing
industry
where
oracle
be
relatively
strong
the
verticalization
of
the
sale
force
only
ram
home
the
absence
of

functionality
in
the

that

be
now
try
to
target
shaw
say
when
we
look
at
the
development
plan
and
how
long
it
would
be
before
we
would
have
a
compete
product
with
rich
functionality
on
a
global
basis
it
be
measure
in
year
not
month
so
that
s
why
we
come
up
with
the
strategy
of
can
we
go
out
and
build
partnership
with
other
application
company
where
we
d
preintegrate
suite
make
up
of
oracle
and
third
party
software
for
vertical
like
the
cpg
consumer
package
good
market
and
the
energy
business
ron
wohl
acknowledges
that
he
could
not
give
lane
and
shaw
what
they
want
when
ray
and
his
team
demand
a
cpg
solution
development
didn
t
have
any
good
answer
because
we
couldn
t
build
it
in
anything
like
the
time
frame
that
sale
want
sometimes
the
engineering
answer
may
not
be
acceptable
to
sale
they
try
to
convince
larry
that
oracle
s
strength
be
its
sale
force
rather
than
its
product
if
we
need
to
license
the

from
somebody
else
let
s
go
ahead
and
do
it
robert

those

so
badly
face
with
apparently
insuperable
time
to
market
problem
oracle
embrace
a
best
of
breed
approach
by
identify
the
vendor
that
have
product
that
could
fill
the
gap
in
its
own
package
and
by
come
up
with
a
methodology
for
glue
them
together
into
complete
suite
that
would
be
a
match
for
sap
lane
say
the
idea
be
that
we
would
design
these
template
that
would
convince
the
customer
we
have
the
right
foundation
we
have
financials
and
we
have
hr
but
it
have
take
us
four
year
to
build
global
financials
to
compete
against
sap
who
have
everything
we
would
work
with
these
other
company
to
fill
the
gap
i
endorse
the
strategy

a

uncomfortable
about
use
the
oracle

force
to
sell
third

but
he
be
won
over
both
by
the
argument
that
shaw
present
and
by
the
need
to
take
some
of
the
heat
off
wohl
in
early
board
member
joe
costello
of

have
come
out
in
support
of

s
campaign

costello

that
a
presentation
that
wohl
have
give
to
the

of

be
uninspiring
uninsightful
with
no

at

on

and
fail
to
understand
how
disastrous
thing
in

be
ellison
be
shaken
by
the
intensity
of
costello
s
attack
joe
jumped
up
and
start
scream
at
me
larry
you
re
fuck
up
you
re
fuck
up
the
company
again
just
like
last
time
you
re
fuck
it
up
all
because
i
wouldn
t
fire
ron
wohl
after
such
an
outburst
costello
could
not
remain
on
the
board
his
part
shot
be
to
pick
sap
for
his
firm
rather
than
oracle
ellison
have
already
agree
to
the
idea
of
sell
some
third
party
content
if
it
meant
oracle
could
win
deal
it
would
otherwise
lose
sell
ten
million
dollar
worth
of
oracle
application
along
with
two
million
dollar
worth
of
i
a
supply
chain
specialist
and
a
custom
integration
project
be
just
fine
i
have
no
objection
to
sell
third
party
application
so
long
as
seventy
five
percent
of
the
deal
be
oracle
product
this
phase
one
of
sell
third
party
product
and
custom
integration
work
pretty
well
and
we
won
some
deal
we
otherwise
would
have
lose
phase
two
be
much
more
ambitious
we
d
become
the
king
of
best
of
breed
by
preintegrating
our
application
with
a
number
of
third
party
product
we
d
develop
a
best
of
breed
suite
for
a
number
of
different
industry
rather
than
sell
third
party
product
on
an
exception
basis
to
win
the
occasional
deal
we
d
transform
our
entire
application
business
into
a
best
of
breed
suite
business
and
ray
s
consult
organization
would
run
the
new
application
engineering
and
marketing
team
why
do
i
agree
to
this
well
we
weren
t
do
well
in
application
and
there
be
tremendous
tension
in
the
company
as
a
result
i
didn
t
think
that
this
be
the
time
to
fight
ray
over
application
because
i
wasn
t
sure
i
d
win
the
battle
at
the
board
level
and
i
didn
t
have
any
good
answer
on
how
to
solve
our
application
problem
quickly
ray
would
tell
me
over
and
over
again
how
he
could
do
a
well
job
at
application
development
than
ron
he
just
wore
me
down
so
i
say
okay
go
ahead
and
build
your
best
of
breed
suite
maybe
you
re
right
i
don
t
think
so
but
give
it
your
best
shot
so
oracle
start
buying
and
partner
with
lot
of
application
software
company
we
built
a
consumer
package
good
cpg
suite
an
energy
upstream
and
downstream
suite
a
retail
suite
etc
very
quickly
we
be
in
several
new
application
market
unfortunately
prepackaged
reusable
integration
prove
very
difficult
to
do
so
every
time
we
sell
a
best
of
breed
suite
we
have
to
do
lot
of
custom
integration
for
the
customer
we
lose
money
lot
of
it
on
every
one
we
sell
jeff
henley
say
larry
sort
of
say
this
be
a
horse
s
as
thing
to
do
but
okay
it
be
a
moment
of
weakness
he
felt
that
we
be
get
screw
and
that
the
field
be
mad
at
him
it
seem
sensible
to
ellison
to
adopt
a
twin
track
strategy
lane
and
shaw
would
be
give
their
head
to
work
on
best
of

while
wohl
would
continue
to
slog
away
try
to
make
oracle
s
own
apps
more
competitive
whatever
ellison
s
misgiving
about
allow
the

once
he

give
it
his
blessing
he
have
no
choice
other
than
to
back
it
to
the
hilt
he
say
i
wasn
t
go
to
try
to
undermine
ray
s
strategy
that
would
have
be
madness
while
i
didn
t
think
it
would
work
i
didn
t
know
for
certain
it
wouldn
t
work
and
i
certainly
didn
t
think
it
be
unreasonable
for
us
to
try
and
maybe
we
d
win
more
deal
if
the
sale
force
get
behind
a

they
believe
in

to
the

it
would
divert

away
from

and
because
he
wasn

it
could

consequently
ellison
move
a
young
engineer
call
nimish
mehta

despite

he
be

that
he

the

get

be
capable
of
convincing
multinational

rather
than

many

within
three

that
would
maintain

at

s
from
the

oracle
would
provide
only
one

the

the

would

later
acquire

warehouse
management
from

freeman

would
serve
as
the

integrator
and
would
market
the

solution
all
of
this
would
be
achieve
through
an
oracle
cpgi
define
interface
technique
that
be
base
on
open
application
transaction
and
database
standard
the
complexity
of
this
interface
technique
will
provide
for
external
bolt
on
interfacing
which
be
significantly
easy
than
interfacing
to

naturally
kellogg
would
also
be
expect
and
get
massive
discount
on
both

consult
fee
however
oracle
would
be
gain
valuable
experience
in
cpg
by
work
with
kellogg
and
would
be
able
to
use
it

arrival
as
a
serious

in
a
particular

typical
be
a
deal
with
british
petroleum
to
provide
a
complete
refinery
inventory
management

suddenly
oracle
s
revenue
from

go
into
overdrive
in
the
last
three
month
of

oracle

topped
a

dollar
in
a

for
the

by
a

the

for

contribute
more
to

anyone
such
be
ellison
s
confidence
in
lane
that
he
also
announce
his
promotion
to
president
and
chief
operating
officer
it
be
probably
the
high
water
mark
in
their
relationship
in
early
ellison
be
able
to
boast
that
oracle
be
not
only
the
number
two
application
company
in
the
world
but
be
rapidly
gain
on
number
one
because
our
application
install
more
quickly
adapt
to
change
more
easily
and
operate
more
economically
it
be
a
nice
story
but
it
wasn
t
really
true
the
theory
of
oracle
s
best
of
breed
strategy
to
take
on
sap
be
elegant
and
convincing
but
the
execution
turn
out
to
be
almost
the
exact
opposite
partly
through
the
absurd
commitment
that
oracle
be
prepared
to
make
to
win
business
partly
because
what
it
be
try
to
do
be
extremely
difficult
if
not
actually
impossible
system
integration
be
difficult
enough
at
the
best
of
time
and
sap
implementation
become
a
byword
for
the
time
money
and
agony
that
company
would
have
to
go
through
to
come
out
with
a
function
erp
system
at
the
other
end
many
of
those
that
bought
into
the
hype
over
erp
in
the
s
be
still
try
to
figure
out
the
return
on
their
investment
while
a
good
number
would
rather
not
even
ask
the
question
although
oracle
s
application
be
design
to
be
more
flexible
than
sap
s
much
of
the
flexibility
be
lose
by
try
to
integrate
with
the
application
of
other
vendor
but
the
real
problem
be
oracle
s
ambition
in
most
case
best
of
breed
can
be
make
to
work
with
lot
of
customization
but
even
though
the
same
group
of
vendor
application
may
be
use
in
combination
on
many
different
occasion
each
customer
end
up
with
a
computer
system
that
be
essentially
unique
to
itself
what
lane
shaw
and
another
ex
booz
consultant
name
charlie
schneider
set
out
to
do
through
their
integration
methodology
be
to
make
the
whole
process
repeatable
while
oracle
might
not
make
much
money
on
a
contract
like
the
one
with
kellogg
out
of
it
would
come
a
preintegrated
suite
that
could
be
sell
profitably
to
other
cpg
company
at
a
competitive
price
in
other
word
repeatability
equal
leverage
that
way
oracle
could
convince
itself
and
more
important
lane
could
convince
ellison
that
it
be
still
a
software
firm
and
not
just
a
distributor
integrator
ellison
remembers
they
have
all
these
wonderful
name
for
the
new
integration
technology
that
they
be
develop
the
message
backbone
integration
glue
and
all
this
other
stuff
i
try
to
get
a
detailed
technical
explanation
as
to
how
it
all
work
but
nobody
be
able
to
explain
it
to
me
i
just
couldn
t
understand
what
they
be
say
one
of
two
possibility
here
i
m
too
stupid
to
understand
or
they
don
t
understand
it
either
even
though
they
couldn
t
describe
how
this
stuff
work
they
just
knew
it
would
solve
all
their
product
integration
problem
charlie
schneider
be
a
capable
guy
but
he
have
never
developed
software
before
i
don
t
think
he
ever
understood
the
unbelievable
difficulty
of
building
this
magical
integration
technology
just
because
they
want
it
and
need
it
they
believe
they
could
build
it
it
be
like
wouldn
t
it
be
nice
to
have
fly
car
all
we
have
to
do
be
interface
the
wing
to
this
oldsmobile
and
it
will
be
phenomenal
we
just
need
really
good
glue
brilliant
one
of
the
thing
that
make
it
so
difficult
be
have
to
use
the
proprietary
tool
of
each
application
partner
another
be
get
all
the
piece
to
run
on
the
oracle
database
platform
sohaib
abbasi
say
there
be
component
that
have
never
be
built
for
our
database
and
have
to
be
adapt
for
it
from
a
technology
point
of
view
we
could
never
get
those
application
to
fit
in
with
any
of
our
product
but
the
killer
be
the
upgrade
cycle
of
the
third
party
vendor
ellison
say
imi
would
finish
a
product
in
june
but
manugistics
wouldn
t
have
their
new
version
do
until
november
the
customer
be
allow
to
say
which
product
they
want
which
version
of
which
product
and
in
what
order
they
want
them
implement
the
customer
have
so
much
flexibility
that
there
be
no
repeatability
in
the
system
integration
at
all
each
implementation
turn
out
to
be
unique
the
kellogg
contract
be
a
key
deal
ray
be
able
to
snatch
away
from
sap
at
the
last
minute
by
make
some
astoundingly
open
end
commitment
the
kellogg
contract
basically
say
oracle
will
make
its
application
software
do
whatever
kellogg
need
to
run
its
business
and
make
the
imi
software
and
all
our
other
partner
software
do
whatever
kellogg
need
too
needle
to
say
kellogg
s
software
enhancement
list
be
long
and
our
loss
be
large
on
that
one
interestingly
even
robert
shaw
the
main
evangelist
of
best
of
breed
doesn
t
fundamentally
disagree
with
ellison
about
the
practical
difficulty
at
the
application
layer
it
rapidly
become
an
engineering
nightmare
ray
lane
however
be
unrepentant
he
accepts
that
repeatability
be
a
goal
that
be
never
reach
and
that
oracle
go
through
a
lot
of
pain
especially
in
cpg
but
he
doesn
t
see
it
as
the
failure
that
ellison
do
today
it
be
the
right
decision
the
only
alternative
be
to
let
it
all
go
to
sap
take
cpg
we
generate
a
lot
of
cpg
client
not
without
a
lot
of
pain
but
there
be
maybe
thirty
five
to
fifty
client
in
cpg
alone
who
be
still
oracle
today
include
kellogg
it
generate
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
of
business
lane
argues
that
one
of
the
reason
for
ellison
s
jaundiced
view
of
best
of
breed
be
that
he
still
doesn
t
understand
the
application
business
it
s
not
true
what
larry
say
about
kellogg
no
it
wasn
t
the
great
contract
ever
but
i
think
we
go
into
it
with
our
eye
open
larry
s
not
an
application
guy
with
the
database
larry
s
use
to
building
a
product
where
he
can
ignore
customer
we
be
building
a
suite
of
product
connect
them
together
and
try
to
figure
out
what
kellogg
want
it
to
be
at
the
same
time
sap
have
hundred
of
these
project
look
at
the
story
of
sap
try
to
install
their
suite
at
compaq
or
p
g
a
billion
dollar
two
billion
dollar
they
lose
incredible
amount
of
money
do
this
they
have
the
same
problem
as
we
have
except
that
our
job
be
a
little
tougher
because
of
integrate
third
party
apps
but
this
be
something
larry
be
measure
relative
to
the
database
business
which
we
totally
own
and
in
which
you
just
sell
the
software
and
don
t
change
it
in
many
way
say
lane
the
whole
cpg
thing
be
wildly
successful
larry
would
probably
say
the
problem
be
it
be
wildly
successful
it
sell
to
too
many
client
and
we
didn
t
know
how
to
do
it
well
the
truth
be
if
ron
wohl
wasn
t
in
charge
of
application
we
could
have
do
it
it
can
be
do
ibm
do
it
today
others
do
it
today
larry
start
off
very
enthusiastic
about
this
stuff
and
then
halfway
along
he
start
turn
on
it
because
ron
would
go
to
him
and
say
imi
need
us
to
design
this
thing
and
that
s
not
in
my
budget
i
need
more
money
so
these
partner
become
irritant
larry
have
always
hat
channel
partner
and
ron
be
the
only
one
who
have
his
ear
best
of
breed
be
very
difficult
hard
to
do
but
we
be
do
it
because
our
own
application
suck
he
doesn
t
acknowledge
that
even
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
it
be
difficult
to
know
exactly
where
the
truth
lie
the
only
question
that
really
matter
be
whether
despite
all
its
problem
oracle
be
well
off
do
best
of
breed
lane
believe
that
oracle
still
have
customer
that
it
would
have
lose
forever
without
his
strategy
while
ellison
believe
that
the
business
be
so
unprofitable
that
it
be
a
disaster
ellison
say
we
d
sell
all
this
stuff
from
manugistics
and
i
and
the
others
and
package
it
up
with
service
i
d
say
ray
this
doesn
t
make
any
sense
to
me
we
re
not
make
any
money
and
he
d
say
well
larry
it
s
what
customer
want
to
buy
but
ray
the
fact
that
customer
want
to
buy
it
be
not
very
interest
if
every
time
we
sell
it
we
lose
money
from
a
sale
perspective
jay
nussbaum
say
the
real
danger
in
do
these
smart
thing
be
that
they
be
forget
their
mission
their
mission
be
to
sell
the
damn
database
and
sell
application
sell
software
not
create
solution
that
be
one
of
a
kind
compensation
become
ludicrous
because
you
d
be
pay
two
or
three
people
salesperson
application
people
solution
people
for
do
the
same
thing
there
be
too
much
energy
be
spent
without
enough
margin
not
surprisingly
robert
shaw
doesn
t
think
it
be
all
bad
he
say
i
see
both
ray
and
larry
s
point
of
view
and
i
be
in
the
middle
of
have
to
make
it
work
there
be
failure
at
kellogg
but
there
be
success
in
other
place
i
think
larry
be
be
crowd
by
jeff
henley
to
make
money
from
application
he
kept
say
this
be
a
black
hole
how
much
be
it
go
to
cost
us
to
maintain
these
application
base
on
the
contract
we
be
signing
we
be
make
a
ton
of
money
on
the
consult
side
be
also
drag
database
so
overall
it
be
probably
a
pretty
profitable
business
but
i
think
what
larry
figure
out
be
that
when
he
start
hand
out
the
assignment
to
the
development
manager
to
take
responsibility
for
integrate
the
suite
he
kept
see
failure
jeff
henley
have
initially
accepted
that
some
margin
erosion
be
the
price
to
be
paid
for
play
the
game
and
keep
some
momentum
however
what
turn
out
to
be
horrify
to
all
of
us
be
that
we
underestimated
what
we
be
get
into
when
everybody
start
want
slightly
different
permutation
of
this
or
that
best
of
breed
combination
it
become
clear
that
support
this
stuff
and
migrate
it
be
just
horrific
we
knew
we
weren
t
go
to
make
a
lot
of
money
resell
software
that
be
okay
but
when
we
discover
the
real
implication
how
much
it
be
really
cost
us
we
be
horrify
an
example
of
how
it
be
possible
to
see
the
same
thing
very
differently
at
oracle
be
something
set
up
by
lane
call
the
max
account
to
deal
with
the
cost
overrun
of
implement
buggy
application
or
create
interface
with
partner
software
that
hadn
t
be
deliver
in
time
by
development
shaw
say
of
his
consultant
we
want
relief
in
our
budget
because
we
be
spending
so
much
time
building
around
the
product
to
make
it
work
in
a
customer
site
shaw
s
argument
be
that
it
be
unfair
for
either
the
consult
team
or
the
customer
to
eat
the
additional
cost
consult
manager
be
paid
on
the
profit
margin
of
the
engagement
they
be
work
on
the
idea
be
to
steer
cost
they
felt
be
not
their
fault
into
the
max
account
lane
expect
development
to
cooperate
put
its
hand
up
if
it
have
fail
to
produce
something
that
have
be
promise
accord
to
ellison
a
consequence
of
the
max
account
be
that
the
consult
group
dramatically
improve
its
profitability
the
company
s
profitability
be
deteriorate
but
accord
to
our
accounting
report
each
of
ray
s
group
be
control
expense
fabulously
well
i
didn
t
understand
how
this
could
be
possible
but
i
found
out
ray
have
a
system
where
his
manager
could
spend
money
and
not
be
charge
for
it
for
example
when
ray
want
to
encourage
training
he
told
his
manager
they
didn
t
have
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
training
their
people
suddenly
every
sale
meeting
become
a
training
meeting
there
be
lot
of
way
to
get
expense
relief
it
be
like
the
goddamn
tax
code
it
create
financial
incentive
for
people
to
do
what
you
want
them
to
do
unfortunately
like
the
tax
code
it
be
load
with
perverse
incentive
and
people
learn
how
to
game
the
system
and
increase
their
profit
bonus
another
side
effect
of
the
max
account
be
that
it
increase
the
already
dangerous
amount
of
finger
point
ellison
say
the
idea
of
people
not
have
to
pay
for
thing
that
aren
t
their
fault
sound
fine
but
it
meant
we
have
to
set
an
adjudication
process
to
determine
fault
oh
yes
i
ve
spent
the
money
but
it
wasn
t
my
fault
how
much
be
your
fault
be
you
just
pretend
it
s
not
your
fault
be
about
seventy
three
percent
not
your
fault
the
whole
notion
of
find
quantify
and
assign
fault
within
the
company
be
perverse
and
poisonous
jeff
henley
say
larry
always
felt
like
the
max
account
be
a
dark
hole
it
s
a
difficult
issue
ray
be
right
that
if
it
be
a
product
problem
why
should
the
poor
consultant
have
to
fix
it
for
free
ray
want
to
expose
the
product
problem
to
development
but
larry
be
right
that
if
you
give
them
an
account
to
charge
they
ll
go
crazy
charge
everything
they
can
get
away
with
if
the
best
of
breed
strategy
have
start
come
apart
at
the
seam
wohl
s
other
track
to
deliver
homegrown
product
with
the
feature
need
to
catch
up
with
sap
wasn
t
do
much
well
early
in
wohl
finally
manage
to
push
oracle
s
first
full
fledge
client
server
suite
out
of
the
door
it
be
call
oracle
smart
client
it
sound
well
than
fat
client
because
all
the
program
logic
be
locate
within
the
application
on
the
client
it
turn
out
to
be
something
of
a
misnomer
smart
client
be
both
buggy
and
unstable
the
problem
accord
to
byron
miller
an
analyst
at
giga
information
group
be
that
the
software
absorbed
too
many
resource
of
the
desktop
client
with
the
result
that
performance
deteriorate
and
the
ability
to
run
the
application
in
a
distribute
multisite
environment
suffer
badly
in
other
word
didn
t
scale
and
be
likely
to
crash
your
pc
oracle
be
not
only
late
to
client
server
it
didn
t
seem
to
be
very
good
at
it
part
of
the
reason
for
the
inadequacy
of
lay
with
the
need
to
divert
developer
into
the
unending
catalogue
of
problem
thrown
up
by
the
effort
to
integrate
the
best
of
breed
suite
but
the
large
reason
be
ellison
s
grow
conviction
follow
his
september
speech
in
paris
launch
the
idea
of
the
network
computer
that
client
server
be
not
the
way
to
go
it
be
as
he
put
it
an
evolutionary
dead
end
instead
of
defend
smart
client
s
shortcoming
to
irate
customer
ellison
agree
with
them
condemn
client
server
as
an
awkward
expensive
and
slow
technology
by
bring
together
the
distribute
complexity
that
be
inherent
to
client

with
the
attempt
to
achieve
repeatability

number
of

with
the
best
of

its
strong

and
oracle
be
a
clear
albeit
distant
second
in
the

nobody
at
oracle
thought
that
it
have
anything
other
than
a
continue
embarrassment
on
its

still
the
row
over

have
an
increasingly
corrosive
effect

even
after

say
that
it
get
paid
only
on
the
royalty
that
the
third
party
vendor
hand
on
to
oracle
for
make
the
sale
typically
to
percent
however
despite
the
weakness
of
oracle
s
application
perhaps
partly
because
of
it
the
consult
business
be
continue
to
grow
at
a
tremendous
clip
by
oracle
service
which
wrap
up
consult
with
support
and
education
account
for
half
of
all
oracle
s
revenue
it
be
a
success
of
a
sort
but
many
within
the
company
be
become
increasingly
concerned
at
its
side
effect
jay
nussbaum
say
we
be
content
to
grow
the
revenue
number
even
if
the
margin
be
play
between
sixteen
and
eighteen
percent
as
long
as
revenue
be
grow
we
fed
the
monster
but
the
reality
be
that
nearly
all
the
margin
be
come
from
technology
licensing
we
may
actually
have
be
lose
money
while
consult
be
grow
at
forty
percent
we
be
take
on
project
we
should
never
have
do
because
of
their
sheer
size
it
be
alienate
all
the
other
distribution
partner
but
robert
be
a
take
no
prisoner
type
of
guy
lane
s
dissatisfaction
with
ron
wohl
be
also
become
an
obsession
he
could
not
restrain
his
criticism
even
when
speak
to
journalist
and
analyst
what
make
him
even
wilder
be
his
frustration
with
ellison
although
ellison
have
give
lane
control
over
nearly
all
of
the
company
development
be
still
a
no
go
area
when
lane
have
propose
that
nimish
mehta
take
over
from
wohl
ellison
ignore
the
idea
but
he
still
seem
to
have
little
interest
in
the
nitty
gritty
of
application
and
from
lane
s
point
of
view
he
seem
perfectly
willing
to
let
the
drift
continue
while
lane
and
shaw
be
deal
with
constant
complaint
from
the
field
and
from
their
relationship
with
major
customer
which
be
far
closer
than
ellison
s
and
learn
how
serious
the
shortcoming
be
ellison
seem
fire
up
only
when
he
be
talk
about
microsoft

how

i
ll
always
remember
call
larry
and
tell
him
that
the
company
be
blowing
up
and
he
have
to
get
off
his
frigging
boat
when
ellison
return
at
the
end
of
september
bloom
confront

i
say
you
ve
get
to
decide
whether
you
re
go
to
re
engage
and
run
the
company
as
ceo
or
not
if
not
i
say
he
d
have
to
go
and
hire
one
oh
and
by
the
way
ray
s
not
it
ray
couldn
t
manage
the
technology
group
by
any
mean
and
he
be
frankly
create
a
scenario
that
be
not
effective
for
the
company
a
bit
earlier
i
have
also
talk
to
ray
about
it
and
say
your
job
be
not
to
make
ron
wohl
fail
you
re
the
president
you
re
the
guy
everybody
listens
to
right
now
because
larry
s
not
here
the
real
kind
of
negative
turn
point
for
me
be
when
he
go
public
say
in
front
of
huge
audience
and
oracle
staff
that
our
application
be
a
disaster
that
s
when
it
become
crystal
clear
that
ray
couldn
t
be
ceo
because
you
can
t
have
a
leader
that
s
out
there
try
to
make
other
leader
fail
it
just
doesn
t
work
bloom
have
an
offer
to
become
ceo
of
another
software
company
if
ellison
wasn
t
prepared
to
take
the
rein
he
have
decide
to
leave
the
job
offer
meant
that
i
have
a
catalyst
to
get
him
interested
in
the
topic
i
told
him
that
i
wasn
t
look
to
leave
but
that
i
couldn
t
work
at
a
place
where
we
be
go
to
fail
i
told
him
that
ray
couldn
t
run
the
company
and
that
in
fact
many
of
the
area
that
he
be
run
be
out
of
control
he
s
busy
draw
attention
to
other
people
s
problem
when
he
s
get
a
million
of
his
own
i
think
he
take
it
pretty
seriously
he
ask
me
to
come
back
the
next
day
to
his
house
when
i
arrive
don
lucas
be
there
as
well
and
larry
say
i
want
you
to
have
a
private
discussion
with
don
and
to
tell
him
your
view
without
me
there
at
about
this
same
time
oracle
be
force
to
issue
its
first
earnings
warn
since
the
dark
day
of
the
moment
market
open
on
december
there
be
a
rush
to
unload
oracle
stock
within
hour
percent
of
the
company
s
market
value
have
be
wipe
out
ellison
soon
face
what
amount
to
another
ultimatum
this
time
from
lane
himself
it
be
about
the
same
issue
as
usual
lane
say
the
subject
be
about
how
ron
have
to
come
out
of
his
job
the
thing
that
provoke
us
into
have
this
specific
meeting
be
that
barry
ariko
who
be
in
charge
of
all
american
sale
and
robert
shaw
have
both
threaten
to
resign
that
s
actually
not
how
they
put
it
to
me
they
come
to
me
and
say
ray
sign
up
with
us
the
three
of
us
will
go
to
larry
and
tell
him
that
if
he
won
t
replace
ron
we
re
all
leave
i
say
that
i
understood
why
they
be
ask
me
to
do
that
but
that
as
president
of
the
company
i
couldn
t
do
that
i
couldn
t
give
an
ultimatum
to
the
ceo
like
that
but
i
would
carry
their
message
to
larry
they
be
really
suffer
they
be
say
that
they
be
have
to
sell
stuff
that
be
subpar
and
that
if
we
do
sell
it
it
be
the
bad
of
all
world
because
then
we
have
to
fix
it
and
we
have
to
try
and
deal
with
ron
who
would
just
ignore
us
randy
baker
who
be
run
support
be
living
in
sheer
hell
the
bug
count
on
be
so
high
that
it
be
an
environment
that
be
impossible
to
manage
this
be
the
bad
incrimination
of
ron
i
can
think
of
at
one
time
we
have
to
stop
development
completely
and
put
all
of
ron
s
staff
on
crunch
bug
the
meeting
between
lane
and
ellison
take
place
in
january
lane
say
that
the
situation
with
wohl
have
to
come
to
an
end
or
shaw
and
ariko
would
quit
i
say
there
need
to
be
a
mr
application
somebody
who
can
really
go
head
to
head
with
sap
i
want
larry
to
throw
ron
out
and
hire
a
professional
i
say
you
brought
in
me
you
brought
in
jeff
henley
why
in
hell
can
t
you
bring
in
somebody
to
run
application
development
when
as
usual
ellison
raise
the
objection
that
actually
find
such
a
person
might
not
be
very
easy
lane
say
he
even
have
a
suggestion
robert
shaw
should
become
mr
application
it
wasn
t
clear
who
shaw
would
report
to
lane
say
he
could
report
to
ellison
ellison
have
no
doubt
that
shaw
would
have
continued
to
have
lane
as
his
bos
shaw
say
i
knew
about
the
proposal
and
i
be
willing
to
do
the
job
it
make
a
tremendous
amount
of
sense
i
also
knew
that
larry
would
never
agree
to
it
never
never
lane
insists
that
he
be
interested
only
in
find
a
way
out
of
the
impasse
over
application
this
be
not
however
the
way
ellison
saw
it
he
believe
that
lane
be
use
the
threaten
departure
of
shaw
and
ariko
to
grab
still
more
power
what
s
more
in
do
so
he
have
step
over
a
critical
line
ellison
have
be
willing
to
let
lane
run
just
about
everything
else
at
oracle
but
development
would
always
be
his
domain
ellison
say
ray
ask
me
whether
i
thought
he
should
run
development
i
say
no
not
really
i
think
he
genuinely
believe
that
he
be
well
equip
to
run
development
than
i
be
he
felt
the
most
serious
problem
in
the
company
be
in
development
he
have
decide
he
couldn
t
solve
them
without
me
out
of
the
way
and
without
him
run
development
jay
nussbaum
put
it
succinctly
ray
have
step
into
the
sacred
burial
ground
ellison
knew
he
could
no
longer
placate
or
ignore
lane
as
he
have
in
the
past
on
the
subject
of
ron
wohl
and
application
jeff
henley
say
thing
have
change
with
that
last
quarter
we
d
set
a
record
on
wall
street
for
the
most
amount
of
value
lose
in
a
single
day
and
the
stock
have
go
on
be
pummel
into
january
the
board
be
piss
and
larry
be
embarrass
as
hell
by
the
way
we
d
fall
on
our
rear
end
there
be
lot
of
thing
go
wrong
like
ray
s
disastrous
sale
reorganization
but
the
real
recur
issue
be
the
product
however
ellison
be
damn
if
he
be
either
go
to
hand
apps
over
to
shaw
whom
he
didn
t
consider
to
be
technically
qualify
or
get
rid
of
the
loyal
wohl
ellison
say
ray
s
solution
be
to
put
robert
shaw
in
charge
of
everything
but
robert
have
never
developed
a
software
product
in
his
life
finally
out
of
extreme
frustration
and
great
fear
of
put
robert
in
charge
of

i
say
okay

i
thought
that
understand
and
automate
all
these
business
process
would
be
dull
and
duller
it
just
wasn
t
a
book
i
want
to
read
as
for
lane
he
say
i
have
no
choice
i
sent
an
e
mail
out
to
the
entire
field
say
larry
be
take
over

it
to
larry
before
it
go
out
he
do
a
few
edits
to
protect
ron
but
it
be
very
direct
what
lane
didn
t
realize
be
the
speed
at
which
he
be
lose
ellison
s
confidence
and
support
it
wasn
t
long
before
ellison
be
able
to
convince
himself
that
after
the
thwart
of
his
power
play
to
replace
wohl
with
robert
shaw
lane
be
now
hop
that
have
take

jeff
henley
think
that
ellison
may
well
have
felt
threaten
but
he
have
no
time
for
the
idea
that
lane
be
try
to
take
larry
s
job
george
robert
who
succeed
barry
ariko
as
head
of
u
s
sale
be
convince
that
lane
never
want
oracle
to
be
anything
other
than
successful
and
while
he
might
have
sound
off
against
ellison
at
time
of
great
frustration
never
thought
he
could
replace
him
jay
nussbaum
no
ally
of
lane
say
let
me
make
something
perfectly
clear
at
this
point
ray
have
such
a
huge
financial
upside
that
if
larry
fail
ray
also
fail
there
be
no
root
for
larry
s
failure
none
whatsoever
gary
bloom
who
be
shock
by
what
he
saw
as
lane
s
undermine
of
wohl
in
public
agrees
i
don
t
think
ray
want
larry
to
fail
i
would
not
put
that
burden
on
him
i
think
they
have
different
view
on
how
to
fix
application
and
how
to
make
it
well
the
truth
i
think
be
that
lane
be
determine
to
make
ellison
take
his
responsibility
for
fix
application
seriously
and
that
the
best
way
of
achieve
that
be
to
put
his
bos
under
as
much
public
pressure
to
deliver
as
possible
when
i
put
the
question
to
lane
he
look
shock
and
sad
i
m
go
to
give
you
a
very
strange
response
to
this
have
larry
read
the
situation
right
and
have
he
work
on
the
real
problem
then
maybe
we
d
still
have
a
relationship
and
there
s
no
question
oracle
be
much
well
off
with
both
larry
and
me
there
as
a
team
he
totally
misread
it
i
be
tire
of
not
be
competitive
i
be
tire
of
ron
produce
sucky
application
that
we
couldn
t
sell
and
i
desperately
need
somebody
to
replace
him
when
larry
say
how
about
me
i
totally
support
that
i
go
out
and
sell
that
strategy
to
everybody
i
say
larry
s
go
to
do
it
and
three
month
later
he
come
up
with
a
strategy
at
first
i
doubt
he
would
spend
the
time
but
he
do
i
didn
t
want
to
run
application
it
wasn
t
a
power
play
at
all
in
which
case
why
do
ellison
who
so
recently
have
seem
to
think
that
lane
be
close
to
be
the
perfectly
complementary
number
two
someone
he
be
prepared
to
give
virtually
equal
billing

le
writes
it
be
a
big
mistake
and
it
be
my
mistake
i
didn
t
think
that
microsoft
window
would
crush
ibm
o
and
all
the
other
desktop
system

it
do
le
writes
ray
and
i
both
agree
that
our
database
sale
force
be
not
very
good
at
sell
application
but
we
disagreed
as
to
why
and
what
to
do
about
it
ray
thought
the
problem
be
they
didn
t
understand
how
to
sell
application
due
to
lack
of
training
and
relevant
industry
experience
i
agree
with
those
point
but
thought
the
problem
be
compound
by
the
fact
that
our
salesperson
would
be
foolish
to
spend
their
time
compete
for
application
deal
when
they
could
make
much
more
money
by
concentrate
on
sell
the
database
no
amount
of
training
and
experience
could
ever
solve
that
problem
so
i
thought
we
should
create
a
separate
dedicate
application
sale
force
but
i
could
never
convince
ray
he
want
oracle
to
have
one
sale
force
because
he
insist
that
customer
want
to
deal
with
one
and
only
one
oracle
sale
force
this
grow
to
become
a
huge
point
of
contention
between
ray
and
me
and
it
wasn
t
until
after
ray
left
that
we
begin
splitting
and
specialize
our
sale

the

step
back
what

wrong
everybody
in

look
at

i
don

know
characteristically
ellison
do
what
he
could
to
avoid
an
embarrass
confrontation
the
main
reason
he
give
to
lane
for
want
him
to
leave
be
his
concern
about
how
divide
the
company
have
become
with
two
leader
ellison
say
i
explain
that
there
be
too
much
ambiguity
of
authority
at
a
time
when
we
be
try

reinvent

the

to
make
it
more
centralize
more
automate
more
of
an
e
business
it
s
very
difficult
to
make
change
when
a
lot
of
the
exist
manager
didn
t
believe
in
the
change
i
want
to
make
most
of
our
senior
people

be
autonomous
general

they
want
to
be
give
a
budget
and
left
alone
to
run
the
business
as
they
saw
fit
lane
insists
that
ellison
didn
t
have
the
stomach
to
sack
him
larry
be
incapable
of
fire
me
i
say
i
guess
i
have
get
to
leave
if
you
ve
take
back
the
president
s
title
he
say
well
that
s
your
choice
i
now
wish
i
d
say
okay
you
ve
get
the
title
what
do
i
call
myself
now
he
couldn
t
fire
me
he
doesn
t
know
how
to
do
it
the
two
men
then
briefly
discuss
a
press
release

lane
suggest
that
they
should
talk
about
the

he

million
worth
of
option
due
to
vest
in
three
week
and
he
propose
a
termination

so
that
i

good
thing
about
oracle
and
we
both
have
the
same
story
about
why
i
left
larry

of
course
let
me
look
into
it
and
i
ll
call
you
back
he
never
call
back
the
terse
press
release
that
oracle
release
that
even

no

up

a
tribute
from
ellison

s
year
of

ellison
admits
that
in
the
end
he
couldn

bring
himself
to
say
what
he
didn

already

more
than

they

the

what
s
this

i
have
to
explain
it
to
the

it

totally
below
the

nor

any

ellison

million

get
laid
off
lane
refuse
to
sign
the
deal
he
really
didn
t
need
the
money
anyway
in
subsequent
interview
his
version
of
event
be
that
he
have
resign
over
change
within
the
company
that
ellison
be
propose
to
make
and
with
which
he
disagreed
for
his
part
ellison
insist
that
lane
be
leave
because
as
a
result
of
the
way
oracle
have
recently
centralize
its
operation
around
the
internet
he
no
longer
have
a
big
enough
job
to
do
only
later
when
he
could
no
longer
control
the
urge
to
trash
his
former
business
partner
do
he
admit
that
he
have
fire
lane
what
happen
be
that
the
man
who
many
people
outside
oracle
believe
to
have
be
responsible
for
the
firm
s
reinvention
and
much
of
its
success
in
the
s
have
be
slowly
frozen
out
and
systematically
strip
of
authority
when
ellison
say
that
he
have
no
need
to
replace
lane
it
be
because
there
really
wasn
t
much
left
of
lane
s
job
by
the
time
he
left
within
three
year
of
his
arrival
at
oracle
lane
s
reputation
in
the
industry
be
so
high
that
he
be
soon
receive
a
stream
of
job
offer
with
most
he
never
go
far
than
the
first
step
however
there
be
a
few
that
lane
be
willing
to
explore
far
one
come
from
john

after
take
a
close
look
at
what
be
involve
lane
say
no
i
didn
t
see
myself
as
a
start
up
guy
much
later
lane
would
be
on
the
short
list
of
candidate
to
become
ceo
of
hewlett
packard
the
stately
computer
hardware
company
that
launch
the
silicon
valley
phenomenon
in
the
s
but
the
job
he
come
closest
to
take
be
with
the
once
high
fly
networking
firm
novell
at
first
he
wasn
t
interested
novell
once
the
leader
in
network
operating
system
software
be
be
badly
beaten
up
by
the
onward
march
of
microsoft
s
window
nt
while
its
groupwise
collaboration
software
be
be
squeeze
on
both
side
by
lotus
note
and
microsoft
exchange
novell
still
have
plenty
of
cash
but
what
it
lack
be
any
kind
of
strategy
to
get
it
out
of
its
hole
what
change
his
mind
be
an
unannounced
visit
by
david
burn
one
of
the
toughest
and
most
persuasive
headhunter
in
the
business
and
john
young
who
be
not
only
a
novell
board
member
but
a
highly
respect
former
chairman
of
hewlett
packard
they
come
into
my
living
room
and
put
this
offer
in
front
of
me
that
include
million
of
cash
that
would
be
put
straight
into
my
bank
account
and
million
in
option
at
the
current
price
which
be
an
all
time
low
for
novell
and
i
m
just
go
holy
mackerel
and
say
give
me
an
hour
and
i
ll
just
write
down
some
thought
about
a
strategy
for
a
turnaround
because
that
will
help
tell
me
whether
it
s
possible
so
i
write
four
page
that
i
share
with
them
and
say
here
s
what
i
d
do
and
they
say
that
s
why
we
want
you
you
ve
just
write
a
strategy
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
i
be
nervous
i
be
an
oracle
devotee
there
for
life
and
i
be
very
very
nervous
about
this
but
i
be
say
ceo
turnaround
lot
of
money
and
i
agree
that
i
d
go
and
see
larry
and
tell
him
i
be
resign
so
i
go
to
see
larry
that
afternoon
in
his
house
and
i
say
i
ve
get
an
offer
from
novell
he
say
novell
just
like
that
novell
that
brain
dead
company
i
say
larry
look
at
it
my
way
it
s
a
turnaround
opportunity
and
they
re
go
to
pay
me
all
this
money
he
say
you
re
not
go
their
server
isn
t
programmable
you
have
no
apis
to
build
application
it
s
dead
meat
and
microsoft
will
take
them
out
so
he
basically
have
scar
me
out
of
take
the
job
anyway
but
then
he
say
how
about
two
million
option
would
you
stay
for
two
million
option
i
say
yes
it
s
more
than
adequate
i
m
not
do
this
because
i
think
novell
s
great
it
s
for
the
money
i
go
to
young
and
burn
and
say
sorry
guy
i
m
stay
at
oracle
that
night
i
go
to
the
fiftieth
birthday
party
of
robert
shaw
s
wife
and
larry
call
me
on
my
cell
phone
he
say
he
d
talk
to
the
board
and
he
thought
million
in
option
be
the
right
number
you
deserve
it
i
thought
he
d
go
way
overboard
so
of
course
i
stayed
i
didn
t
find
out
until
i
left
oracle
that
the
board
be
piss
off
about
this
no
one
ever
told
me
and
i
certainly
wasn
t
hold
oracle
up
for
money
ellison
s
recollection
of
what
happen
be
a
little
different
he
say
that
the
figure
of
million
be
lane
s
price
for
stay
at
oracle
and
that
the
main
reason
he
increase
the
number
to
million
be
that
perversely
by
volunteer
additional
option
he
felt
a
little
more
in
control
of
the
situation
a
little
less
respond
to
blackmail
he
also
want
to
ensure
that
lane
really
would
give
novell
the
brush
off
that
say
the
most
convincing
explanation
for
ellison
s
excessive
generosity
to
lane
be
that
he
panicked
his
first
reaction
be
sheer
amazement
that
lane
actually
thought
that
he
might
be
able
to
fix
novell
i
say
ray
novell
doesn
t
have
a
service
problem
and
it
doesn
t
have
a
sale
problem
they
distribute
through
third
party
those
be
the
thing
you
re
best
at
what
novell
have
be
a
very
serious
product
problem
i
don
t
know
what
i
d
do
if
i
go
to
novell
i
think
it
s
too
late
however
his
second
reaction
be
fear
that
despite
his
demolition
job
on
novell
s
prospect
correct
as
it
turn
out
even
eric
schmidt
a
first
class
technologist
prove
unable
to
save
novell
lane
might
still
go
through
with
his
resignation
at
this
point
in
ray
s
career
he
thought
he
could
do
just
about
anything
even
turn
around
novell
which
i
thought
be
impossible
but
i
couldn
t
afford
for
him
to
take
the
novell
job
i
felt
terribly
vulnerable
because
he
be
run
such
a
large
portion
of
the
company
with
the
problem
we
be
have
in
application
development
which
be
where
i
thought
i
should
focus
my
time
i
didn
t
have
the
bandwidth
to
take
on
anything
more
besides
i
really
didn
t
know
how
marketing
ran
or
how
sale
ran
i
just
didn
t
feel
i
have
the
time
or
competence
to
take
over
those
thing
if
he
left
so
i
paid
him
off
ellison
be
right
oracle
would
have
be
in
a
jam
if
lane
have
suddenly
quit
in
early
but
there
be
a
substantial
price
to
be
paid
by
both
men
for
ellison
s
bribery
if
lane
be
get
inflate
idea
of
his
talent
thanks
to
the
flatter
press
coverage
that
ellison
be
happy
for
him
to
receive
learn
that
ellison
thought
him
so
important
to
oracle
that
he
be
willing
to
make
him
fabulously
wealthy
be
bound
to
puff
his
ego
up
still
far
don
lucas
say
he
warn
larry
about
the
possible
effect
i
ll
never
forget
it
i
very
very
seldom
have
disagreed
with
larry
this
be
a
huge
stock
option
like
a
bribe
as
oppose
to
an
incentive
that
s
go
to
twist
people
s
mind
it
have
all
these
bad
effect
ray
say
to
himself
i
m
worth
all
this
money
i
m
irreplaceable
i
ve
get
a
lot
of
power
i
m
like
superman
so
it
reinforces
all
the
bad
thing
if
we
d
give
him
regular
incentive
and
if
ray
would
have
stayed
i
think
that
would
have
be
well
for
everybody
if
he
want
to
be
loyal
to
the
company
and
get
compensation
reasonable
compensation
he
stay
if
he
want
to
go
be
a
big
shot
be
a
ceo
have
all
that
power
that
s
fine
leave
it
would
have
be
well
for
everybody
so
i
think
that
be
a
critical
juncture
i
m
not
say
i
be
right
and
larry
be
wrong
but
i
think
you
have
to
stand
by
your
principle
and
i
think
to
overcompensate
can
have
deleterious
effect
from
his
perspective
as
a
senior
member
of
lane
s
team
jay
nussbaum
be
convince
that
something
have
change
the
novell
thing
piss
off
everybody
at
oracle
ray
would
always
argue
about
loyalty
trust
and
integrity
but
everyone
saw
what
he
do
he
put
on
a
mask
and
take
a
gun
to
larry
s
head
it
give
a
signal
to
the
world
that
ray
didn
t
respect
larry
and
he
thought
he
should
be
ceo
he
have
this
blind
ambition
it
become
obvious
that
there
be
no
love
affair
so
much
so
that
larry
start
to
wonder
what
life
would
be
like
without
ray
even
though
ellison
use
the
threat
of
lane
s
departure
to
get
another
million
option
for
himself
and
million
for
jeff
henley
he
felt
increasingly
sick
about
what
he
d
do
i
don
t
think
he
really
blame
lane
for
what
have
happen
but
he
thought
that
he
have
in
some
sense
be
manipulate
and
the
feel
fester
carolyn
balkenhol
who
take
over
from
jenny
overstreet
as
ellison
s
close
assistant
in
have
an
interest
perspective
i
think
the
thing
that
always
upset
him
most
be
his
own
issue
i
think
that
when
he
seem
really
angry
it
s
because
he
s
do
something
that
he
perceive
to
be
a
mistake
particularly
when
he
s
make
a
decision
that
he
think
have
set
in
motion
a
series
of
event
which
didn
t
have
the
desire
result
i
think
most
often
if
he
s
really
angry
it
s
because
he
do
something
that
take
a
wrong
turn
ellison
begin
to
realize
that
not
for
the
first
time
in
his
eagerness
to
carve
out
just
the
portion
of
the
ceo
s
job
that
he
enjoy
he
have
delegate
too
much
power
and
responsibility
it
s
a
characteristic
of
ellison
that
when
he
think
he
have
found
someone
who
be
competent
and
who
can
help
him
he
invests
an
excessive
amount
of
faith
in
his
or
her
ability
just
as
when
gary
kennedy
say
he
need
more
authority
to
get
the
job
do
ellison
would
give
it
to
him
without
much
thought
the
same
apply
to
lane
albeit
on
a
much
grander
scale
ellison
say
i
ve
be
to
this
movie
i
m
not
go
to
let
this
happen
again
at
some
point
in
ellison
s
eye
ray
lane
stop
be
the
solution
and
start
to
become
part
of
the
problem
within
a
year
of
lane
s
receive
his
option
grant
of
january
ellison
have
begin
the
process
of
peel
away
his
direct
report
strongly
influence
by
gary
bloom
s
critique
of
lane
s
management
and
his
plea
that
ellison
should
assume
more
of
the
responsibility
that
normally
go
with
be
a
ceo
ellison
begin
to
shift
whole
department
from
lane
to
bloom
among
the
first
be
marketing
and
education
but
inevitably
the
first
battleground
be
application
ellison
s
realization
that
the
commitment
that
oracle
be
enter
into
with
customer
such
as
kellogg
and
the
never
end
litany
of
lengthy
and
money
lose
implementation
especially
those
involve
the
cpg
best
of
breed
suite
have
convince
him
that
development
must
regain
control
of
product
engineering
by
this
time
even
lane
be
prepared
to
admit
that
best
of
breed
have
prove
a
great
deal
harder
and
more
costly
to
execute
than
he
have
initially
realize
but
tension
increase
between
him
and
ellison
over
the
broad
strategic
direction
that
the
application
business
should
take
although
ellison
have
put
a
stake
in
the
ground
in
paris
two
year
earlier
to
mark
his
profound
disillusionment
about
the
unmanageable
complexity
that
be
inherent
to
client
server
oracle
be
only
now
near
the
point
of
release
software
design
for
the
internet
once
oracle
become
commit
to
engineering
client
server
software
it
be
inescapably
lock
into
that
architecture
for
year
even
if
theoretically
a
well
alternative
might
have
exist
ellison
s
public
statement
about
the
come
of
internet
compute
be
not
just
about
attract
medium
coverage
and
tantalize
customer
they
be
also
a
deliberate
tactic
to
open
up
the
debate
within
oracle
ellison
say
you
can
t
tell
engineer
just
do
it
you
have
to
persuade
them
that
the
internet
be
a
well
architecture
than
client
server
you
have
to
persuade
them
the
internet
be
go
to
win
in
the
marketplace
even
though
microsoft
be
backing
client
server
all
the
way
they
have
to
believe
in
what
they
be
do
if
you
simply
bark
out
order
you
get
malicious
obedience
they
ll
build
exactly
what
you
want
and
make
sure
it
doesn
t
work
i
have
to
proselytize
in
every
meeting
it
take
year
before
we
kill
off
our
last
client
server
product
it
wasn
t
fun
i
d
say
you
know
that
thing
you
ve
be
work
on
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
throw
it
all
away
we
don
t
want
it
it
piss
people
off
they
d
say
i
ve
be
work
hard
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
now
you
want
me
to
throw
it
all
away
yeah
i
do
be
you
crazy
i
quit
it
be
very
difficult
to
get
all
the
developer
inside
oracle
to
change
direction
everything
they
be
reading
say
that
microsoft
and
client
server
would
go
on
forever
i
get
the
same
look
that
galileo
get
when
he
told
people
the
earth
revolve
around
the
sun
sure
whatever
you
say
bos
for
the
first
year
most
of
ellison
s
internet
evangelize
be
confine
to
technology
the
database
and
tool
the
thing
that
he
knew
and
care
most
about
but
it
begin
to
dawn
on
him
that
the
impact
on
oracle
s
struggle
application
might
be
even
more
profound
ron
wohl
take
only
a
little
convincing
he
say
in
the
application
business
you
can
never
catch
and
pas
someone
who
have
dominant
market
share
unless
something
else
change
if
you
do
the
same
thing
as
a
competitor
who
s
ahead
of
you
you
ll
never
catch
up
that
s
the
position
we
be
in
with
sap
ellison
believe
that
oracle
be
so
far
behind
in
client
server
that
the
only
way
to
win
in
application
be
to
change
the
game
there
be
two
reason
why
oracle
might
be
able
to
pull
it
off
the
first
be
the
increase
number
of
customer
that
be
discover
the
difficulty
in
make
client
server
system
work
effectively
over
a
wide
area
network
client
server
might
be
all
right
for
departmental
use
but
for
any
company
that
want
to
unify
its
operation
over
a
number
of
different
site
it
be
a
nightmare
after
a
decade
of
client
server
as
the
dominant
compute
architecture
at
least
some
disillusion
customer
be
ready
to
hear
about
alternative
the
second
be
that
quite
simply
oracle
have
much
less
to
lose
by
bet
everything
on
the
internet
if
sap
have
do
the
same
and
have
fail
to
make
the
technology
transition
gracefully
it
would
have
destroyed
a
wonderful
business
for
no
good
reason
it
s
the
dilemma
of
all
incumbent
and
the
reason
why
the
short
history
of
the
software
business
be
litter
with
the
bone
of
once
successful
firm
that
fail
to
adapt
to
new
paradigm
in
time
it
therefore
make
sense
to
ellison
to
devote
an
increase
amount
of
development
time
to
work
out
how
to
make
a
web
base
servercentric
version
of
even
if
one
of
the
consequence
be
to
deny
smart
client
the
resource
need
to
debug
it
properly
before
its
release
ron
wohl
say
from
we
start
move
a
small
number
of
key
technical
people
onto
the
underlie
architecture
then
a
large
number
of
people
then
gradually
the
whole
division
we
ran
the
risk
that
by
pour
energy
into
the
internet
version
we
be
not
make
the
improvement
we
need
in
the
client
server
version
for
ray
lane
it
be
just
another
example
of
ellison
and
wohl
s
failure
to
understand
the
application
business
as
far
as
he
be
concerned
customer
weren
t
interested
in
esoteric
architectural
issue
what
they
want
be
reasonably
stable
software
that
have
all
the
functionality
they
need
to
run
their
operation
the
fact
that
smart
client
be
a
couple
of
year
late
to
market
be
bad
enough
the
fact
that
it
still
wasn
t
much
good
be
intolerable
what
s
strike
be
that
there
be
so
little
consensus
between
the
two
men
run
oracle
as
to
what
the
application
strategy
should
be
if
ellison
have
work
hard
to
convince
the
development
organization
that
internet
compute
offer
a
well
way
than
client
server
either
he
fail
to
let
lane
in
on
the
secret
or
lane
wasn
t
listen
the
idea
that
there
be
a
trade
off
between
get
smart
client
right
and
oracle
be
first
to
the
internet
be
not
one
that
lane
have
much
time
for
he
claim
that
when
the

version
of
know
as
nca

out
in

any
well

the

nca

what

we

it

you
have
to
have
java
code
run
on
the

or
it
wouldn
t
work
the
only
reasonably
reliable
variant
of

the
unglamorous
character

version
that
ran
on

and
that
few
customer

up

unfortunately
communication

advice
about

as
ron

admits
development
must
always
move
ahead
of

consult

it

that
half

they

we

building
the

the
issue

decision
to
halt

in

have
reluctantly
become
mr
application
ellison
threw
himself
into
the
task
one
of
the
problem
be
that
oracle
be
now
try
to
support
three
different
version
of
its
application
suite
ellison
say
we
be
the
only
vendor
support
three
different
mode
of
operation
terminal
client

and
internet
life
isn
t
hard
enough
we
have
to
have
three
fuck
version
the
client
server
version
work
poorly
on
a
wide
area
network
and
be
nearly
impossible
to
maintain
because
the
application
code
be
on
hundred
or
thousand
of
desktop
pc
our
so
call
smart
client
version
be
not
smart
it
be
unnecessarily
complex
and
i
want
to
dump
it
ellison
be
desperate
to
move
ahead
i
decide
to
get
out
of
the
client
server
application
business
just
as
fast
as
possible
he
want
release
to
ship
as
soon
as
possible
to
expunge
the
memory
of
and
this
time
he
want
only
one
version
if
ellison
have
his
way
would
be
engineer
for
the
internet
only
ellison
be
certain
that
oracle
could
not
succeed
if
it
have
both
an
offensive
and
a
defensive
strategy
the
analogy
he
use
be
take
from
the
six
day
war
when
the
israeli
have
be
willing
to
bet
everything
on
take
out
the
egyptian
and
syrian
air
force
on
the
ground
even
if
it
meant
leave
their
own
airspace
un
protect
lane
strongly
disagreed
it
wasn
t
that
he
be
against
oracle
s
try
to
get
ahead
of
the
field
by
embrace
the
internet
but
he
be
oppose
to
leave
in
the
lurch
customer
who
have
sign
contract
for
client
server
software
his
fear
be
that
if
oracle
be
see
as
dictate
to
the
market
a
lot
of
customer
would
simply
walk
ron
wohl
comment
the
idea
of
move
to
the
internet
be
a
no
brainer
the
hard
decision
be
cut
off
client
server
and
commit
ourselves
totally
that
s
why
nca
be
so
important
it
would
give
us
reference
people
have
to
believe
that
the
internet
version
of
our
application
work
that
allow
us
then
to
go
to
the
next
stage
and
say
guess
what
this
internet
technology
not
only
work
but
it
s
so
superior
to
client
server
that
we
re
not
even
go
to
offer
client
server
we
be
say
that
when
release
come
out
five
month
after
nca
it
s
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
internet
ellison
be
convince
that
lane
mount
a
serious
challenge
to
his
internet
or
bust
strategy
he
say
ray
didn
t
want
to
bet
the
farm
on
internet
application
he
thought
it
be
risky
to
the
point
of
be
crazy
he
thought
that
we
should
do
client
server
too
but
i
d
already
decide
that
the
internet
application
be
our
best
shot
at
be
successful
and
we
didn
t
have
the
resource
to
do
both
in
early
soon
after
ellison
have
take
charge
of
application
he
be
briefing
some
consultant
when
he
receive
a
phone
call
from
ray
lane
lane
have
call
a
meeting
of
his
top
sale
manager
he
want
ellison
to
come
down
and
answer
some
of
their
question
ellison
remembers
i
get
a
call
from
ray
at
about
midday
he
want
me
to
come
and
listen
to
what
the
field
have
to
say
about
give
up
on
client
server
and
they
want
to
tell
me
what
customer
be
say
when
i
get
there
i
be
treat
to
what
seem
to
me
to
be
a
carefully
choreographed
show
the
message
be
clear
our
customer
wouldn
t
tolerate
be
force
away
from
client
server
and
push
to
the
internet
can
you
guy
just
tell
larry
that
what
he
s
do
be
crazy
and
he
s
put
the
entire
company
in
danger
i
have
heard
it
all
before
relational
database
will
never
be
commercially
viable
the
customer
want
client
server
blah
blah
blah
they
be
mistake
the
present
for
the
future
it
s
the
bad
mistake
a
tech
company
can
make
client
server
be
dead
and
the
people
in
the
room
would
figure
that
out
at
the
funeral
by
then
it
would
be
too
late
for
oracle
to
change
course
we
have
to
change
to
internet
application
now
before
sap
and
the
rest
figure
it
out
but
ray
be
have
none
of
it
i
couldn
t
convince
him
or
his
people
this
meeting
come
at
a
time
when
i
be
feel
a
bit
insecure
in
my
position
at
oracle
and
if
push
come
to
shove
i
wasn
t
sure
whether
the
board
would
support
ray
or
me
maybe
it
be
paranoia
on
my
part
but
the
meeting
seem
like
the
begin
of
a
revolution
with
me
play
the
part
of
louis
xvi
at
the
very
least
ray
be
try
to
split
the
company
down
the
middle
his
field
guy
versus
my
development
guy
when
that
dawn
on
me
i
realize
i
have
to
do
everything
i
could
to
keep
a
split
from
happen
so
i
change
tack
i
carefully
and
patiently
listen
to
all
the
field
people
s
comment
and
say
you
know
you
guy
be
right
i
promise
we
ll
go
on
do
client
server
if
we
need
to
but
i
knew
we
d
never
ever
need
to
do
a
client
server
version
and
i
never
plan
to
build
one
but
i
left
the
meeting
let
them
believe
they
have
convince
me
they
hadn
t
i
knew
i
be
right
and
they
be
wrong
ellison
conclude
that
lane
have
attempt
to
set
him
up
i
think
ray
be
try
to
do
two
thing
he
be
try
to
make
sure
that
he
get
a
client
server
version
of
the
application
and
he
be
make
a
power
play
for
more
control
within
oracle
i
be
astonish
that
ray
wouldn
t
support
my
decision
to
kill
client
server
and
put
all
our
resource
on
internet
application
he
be
fight
a
technology
decision
that
be
the
key
to
the
company
s
future
this
wasn
t
simply
about
our
application
this
be
about
predict
the
future
of
compute
we
need
to
move
everything
our
tool
and
our
database
as
well
as
our
application
to
the
internet
as
soon
as
possible
what
be
ray
think
first
he
want
to
build
industry
specific
best
of
breed
application
suite
then
he
want
to
run
application
development
now
he
want
to
set
the
overall
technical
direction
of
the
company
what
the
hell
be
go
on
that
s
my
job
lane
s
version
of
the
episode
be
at
odds
with
ellison
s
he
say
that
the
issue
of
move
away
from
client
server
have
not
be
that
important
it
be
the
same
old
story
that
the
application
didn
t
work
and
they
weren
t
competitive
and
how
ron
wohl
be
a
joke
i
have
about
three
hour
of
try
to
respond
to
this
and
tell
them
that
larry
be
in
application
now
he
be
try
to
fix
these
thing
guy
give
him
some
time
finally
i
say
you
know
guy
you
re
talk
to
the
wrong
person
you
need
to
talk
to
the
head
of
engineering
and
that
s
larry
so
i
call
larry
and
say
come
down
here
it
wasn
t
a
setup
at
all
how
can
you
set
up
the
ceo
i
just
want
him
to
answer
some
question
and
tell
them
he
be
work
on
it
that
s
all
i
actually
thought
he
do
a
great
job
of
handle
them
so
this
stuff
about
internet
be
not
even
a
debate
i
have
a
feel
that
larry
be
try
to
position
himself
as
this
renaissance
man
who
saw
the
light
and
save
everything
he
doesn
t
have
to
he
do
that
doesn
t
take
away
from
the
fact
that
our
application
business
be
a
disaster
but
by
then
larry
have
come
up
with
a
strategy
and
everyone
knew
that
it
would
take
time
before
we
have
application
that
do
it
a
great
strategy
larry
we
love
it
we
ll
do
it
but
when
we
stick
this
stuff
in
our
quota
it
have
to
be
something
real
we
have
to
ship
a
real
product
that
work
otherwise
we
don
t
get
paid
as
usual
the
truth
seem
to
lie
somewhere
in
the
middle
ellison
exaggerates
the
degree
to
which
lane
be
orchestrate
a
campaign
against
the
strategy
of
get
to
the
internet
ahead
of
the
competition
as
a
salesman
lane
be
as
keen
as
anyone
to
have
a
new
story
to
tell
as
ellison
himself
frequently
say
technology
be
a
fashion
business
and
by
the
internet
be
nothing
if
not
fashionable
lane
s
override
concern
be
that
the
transition
to
internet
compute
would
not
happen
as
quickly
as
ellison
hop
leave
his
sale
force
and
consultant
to
carry
on
the
struggle
with
a
suite
of
client
server
application
that
have
be
effectively
orphan
by
the
development
organization
he
be
worried
that
without
any
prospect
of
oracle
s
client
server
software
get
well
customer
would
desert
in
drove
unwilling
to
be
guinea
pig
for
oracle
s
first
web
base
application
that
say
ellison
be
almost
certainly
right
in
think
that
oracle
couldn
t
afford
the
luxury
or
manage
the
complexity
of
develop
radically
different
version
of
all
its
application
software
it
s
a
measure
of
lane
s
understand
of
the
technology
that
he
either
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
see
that
continue
with
client
server
would
make
it
far
less
likely
that
the
internet
strategy
would
succeed
ellison
s
determination
to
cut
off
client
server
entirely
might
have
look
reckless
but
in
fact
it
be
the
only
option
open
to
oracle
that
give
it
any
chance
of
shape
a
future
in
application
that
would
be
well
than
its
troubled
past
by
not
only
question
that
decision
but
make
it
clear
to
the
field
that
he
disagreed
with
it
lane
be
stray
perilously
close
to
challenge
ellison
s
judgment
on
a
major
technology
issue
something
that
even
he
would
agree
he
be
ill
equip
to
do
he
be
also
ensure
that
oracle
would
become
an
even
more
divide
and
factionalized
company
his
long
crusade
against
ron
wohl
whether
justified
or
not
have
become
morally
corrosive
and
commercially
destructive
furthermore
while
lane
constantly
demand
personal
loyalty
of
a
high
order
from
the
people
who
work
for
him
increasingly
he
do
not
appear
to
think
it
necessary
for
them
to
extend
that
loyalty
to
ellison
or
the
people
who
built
oracle
s
product
there
be
little
doubt
that
lane
believe
that
he
be
act
with
the
best
of
intention
but
his
year
of
frustration
over
application
the
flatter
medium
coverage
that
he
have
encourage
and
the
boost
to
his
already
sizable
ego
from
the
novell
episode
have
erode
his
judgment
certainly
regard
his
relationship
with
ellison
as
have
happen
with
gary
kennedy
and
jeff
walker
somebody
who
have
once
be
bath
in
the
beneficent
glow
of
ellison
s
approval
and
admiration
be
about
to
experience
the
chill
of
his
displeasure
ellison
say
that
the
thing
that
disturbed
him
most
be
not
so
much
the
feel
that
lane
be
invade
his
territory
but
that
he
have
lose
touch
with
any
realistic
idea
of
his
own
capacity
when
ray
first
come
to
oracle
he
spent
most
of
his
time
with
customer
he
built
the
kind
of
personal
relationship
that
he
could
rely
on
when
it
come
time
to
close
a
big
deal
that
make
him
a
fantastic
salesman
but
now
all
of
a
sudden
he
think
he
can
come
up
with
a
technology
strategy
that
would
enable
novell
to
compete
with
microsoft
in
pc
server
operating
system
oh
my
god
fight
with
microsoft
in
the
pc
operating
system
market
not
my
first
choice
if
i
m
look
for
a
fight
so
ray
s
a
technology
strategist
now
that
s
why
he
thought
he
could
turn
around
novell
that
s
why
he
fought
with
me
over
client
server
versus
the
internet
ray
decide
that
he
s
good
at
thing
i
didn
t
think
he
be
good
at
scary
think
you
know
thing
you
don
t
know
lead
to
a
lot
of
mistake
but
i
be
also
vulnerable
to
him
leave
because
i
wasn
t
yet
competent
to
take
over
from
him
all
the
thing
he
do
first
i
have
to
move
his
department
to
other
manager
and
that
would
take
time
i
put
it
to
ellison
that
there
be
something
ruthlessly
calculate
about
leave
lane
in
post
while
submit
him
to
a
kind
of
corporate
death
by
a
thousand
cut
ellison
reply
i
have
to
start
repair
thing
piece
by
piece
and
transfer
responsibility
from
ray
s
team
to
the
shadow
management
team
without
overwhelm
it
i
m
not
confrontational
but
i
be
pretty
calculate
this
be
carefully
calculate
ironically
by
push
ellison
into
decide
that
he
have
no
choice
other
than
to
take
over
application
lane
have
trigger
the
process
by
which
his
own
authority
would
unravel
have
remove
all
application
development
from
lane
s
part
of
the
company
and
put
ron

in

somewhat
controversial
woman

karen

i

one
of
the
most
determine
people
i
have
ever
met
but
i
also
felt
that
she
be
miscast
in
marketing
and
i
suspect
that
she
felt
the
same
white
be
push
sideways
and
mark
jarvis
a
personable
englishman
with
a
background
in

be
put
in
charge
and
report
not
to
lane
but
to
gary
bloom
the
next
to
go
in
may
be
education
for
most
big
software
company
educational
program
fulfill
two
important
function
the
first
be
to
spread
expertise
to
it
professional
about
the
use
of
a
company
s
product
the
second
be
to
make
money
company
and
individual
be
prepared
to
pay
substantial
amount
to
gain
useful
and
highly
marketable
skill
however
as
ellison
discover
during
budget
review
in
march
the
first
he
have
be
fully
involve
in
for
year
oracle
s
education
business
be
become
less
and
less
profitable
the
executive
responsible
for
run
education
be
randy
baker
lane
hire
baker
from
tandem
computer
to
run
oracle
s
product
support
organization
later
baker
be
give
the
additional
responsibility
of
run
education
ellison
say
randy
propose
an
education
budget
for
the
follow
year
where
margin
be
plan
to
drop
from
seventeen
percent
to
thirteen
percent
i
thought
margin
should
go
up
not
down
in
fact
i
thought
margin
should
be
much
high
at
least
thirty
and
as
much
as
fifty
percent
nobody
could
give
me
a
satisfactory
explanation
why
our
education
margin
be
so
low
so
i
move
the
education
business
away
from
ray
and
randy
and
to
gary
bloom
and
john
hall
within
a
year
baker
have
left
and
support
be
also
reporting
to
bloom
lane
professes
that
he
wasn
t
worried
about
lose
either
marketing
or
education
i
really
didn
t
care
i
wasn
t
interested
in
keep
marketing
marketing
be
the
most
hat
function
at
oracle
with
education
i
guess
it
probably
be
the
first
signal
that
larry
be
either
do
something
for
gary
or
take
something
from
me
but
i
didn
t
mind
all
that
much
it
be
a
small
business
that
wasn
t
important
to
me
even
now
lane
seem
to
have
only
a
relatively
hazy
idea
about
what
be
actually
go
on
ellison
s
immersion
in
the
application
business
and
his
determination
to
reduce
his
dependence
on
lane
have
a
number
of
consequence
most
obviously
ellison
be
carefully
and
deliberately
building
up
gary
bloom
at
lane
s
expense
ellison
want
people
both
inside
and
outside
oracle
to
see
bloom
as
a
manager
who
have
be
give
tremendous
stature
bloom
say
i
become
the
guy
who
get
all
the
broken
stuff
and
go
and
fix
it
but
i
be
also
building
up
a
follow
base
simply
on
respect
for
delivery
what
lane
didn
t
realize
be
that
bloom
whom
he
have
generously
praise
and
encourage
during
his
rise
up
the
hierarchy
be
an
enemy
contemptuous
of
his
competence
and
eager
to
bring
back
to
ellison
any
information
that
would
cast
lane
in
a
bad
light
wherever
ellison
look
he
seem
to
find
glare
example
of
inefficiency
wastefulness
and
intellectual
sloppiness
a
prime
example
be
something
call
the
energy
center
of
excellence
this
be
intend
as
a
place
to
showcase
oracle
s
best
of
breed
suite
for
the
energy
industry
in
the
course
of
the
budget
session
ellison
say
that
he
uncovered
plan
to
spend
million
of
dollar
to
run
the
center
i
ask
how
much
energy
upstream
and
downstream
software
we
be
planning
to
sell
next
year
the
answer
be
about
million
so
i
say
do
it
bother
anybody
here
that
we
be
forecasting
sale
of
million
and
we
re
spending
million
to
run
an
energy
center
of
excellence
do
that
strike
anyone
as
strange
what
struck
me
as
strange
be
the
fact
that
ray
have
approve
all
of
this
i
ask
ray
to
explain
why
we
be
spending
so
much
money
on
the
energy
center
of
excellence
he
say
larry
that
s
not
what
you
re
pay
me
for
manage
the
energy
center
of
excellence
you
pay
me
to
bring
in
big
deal
i
guess
that
s
true
but
while
he
be
out
sell
somebody
need
to
look
at
our
sale
cost
and
say
no
to
thing
like
a
multimillion
dollar
energy
center
of
excellence
but
nobody
be
in
part
because
of
the
work
he
have
be
do
in
application
ellison
be
begin
to
realize
how
chaotic
many
of
oracle
s
own
process
be
at
the
same
time
he
be
discover
that
in
many
of
the
area
that
lane
be
responsible
for
get
hold
of
the
basic
information
require
for
the
budgeting
process
be
disturbingly
difficult
the
most
basic
budget
planning
module
we
have
in
application
asks
a
few
basic
question
how
much
do
you
sell
last
year
how
much
be
you
go
to
sell
this
year
how
much
do
you
spend
last
year
and
how
much
be
you
go
to
spend
this
year
simple
right
wrong
it
take
many
hour
and
multiple
meeting
to
pry
answer
to
these
four
basic
question
from
some
of
ray
s
senior
manager
one
of
ray
s
people
george
kadifa
now
ceo
of
the
lead
application
service
provider
asp
corio
come
in
with
two
hundred
slide
i
d
say
george
i
ve
get
four
question
once
you
ve
answer
these
four
question
i
ll
look
at
however
many
slide
you
want
me
to
he
be
quite
offend
he
thought
it
be
very
important
for
me
to
look
at
his
slide
first
because
they
explain
and
justified
why
he
would
sell
less
than
last
year
while
spending
more
than
last
year
after
a
while
i
realize
these
weren
t
really
planning
session
at
all
they
be
compensation
negotiation
disguise
as
budgeting
and
planning
everyone
want
me
to
approve
as
low
a
profit
target
for
their
group
as
possible
so
they
could
easily
exceed
it
and
get
a
big
bonus
i
learn
that
a
key
to
make
money
in
sale
at
oracle
be
negotiate
a
low
profit
target
or
quota
i
decide
to
fix
that
problem
ellison
be
determine
to
get
involve
in
another
area
that
have
be
entirely
lane
s
responsibility
the
design
of
sale
force
compensation
patronage
be
power
and
after
hire
and
fire
there
be
no
great
power
within
a
company
than
set
the
remuneration
of
the
sale
staff
by
decide
that
he
rather
than
lane
would
in
future
determine
how
the
sale
force
be
paid
ellison
be
signal
in
the
clearest
possible
way
that
lane
s
power
be
in
terminal
decline
in
any
sale
driven
organization
the
way
in
which
the
comp
plan
be
structure
be
a
vital
ingredient
in
determine
success
or
failure
the
objective
of
a
good
comp
plan
be
simply
state
it
should
be
transparent
and
fair
and
encourage
the
achievement
of
carefully
work
out
stretch
target
the
salesperson
who
do
most
for
the
bottom
line
should
be
able
to
get
rich
themselves
while
those
who
be
hop
for
a
free
ride
should
be
penalize
and
clear
out
in
other
word
the
best
comp
plan
be
simple
to
understand
and
work
with
the
grain
of
human
nature
when
comp
plan
start
deliver
the
opposite
of
what
s
intend
it
s
usually
because
they
have
become
too
clever
by
half
that
be
precisely
what
ellison
thought
have
happen
at
oracle
jay
nussbaum
recall
the
budgeting
session
be
a
real
watershed
i
be
tell
larry
about
how
there
be
so
much
fuck
abuse
and
waste
in
the
system
and
larry
s
say
tell
me
more
tell
me
more
tell
me
more
so
i
call
ray
and
told
him
that
larry
be
ask
me
a
lot
about
compensation
and
do
you
want
me
to
brief
you
about
it
so
i
start
to
tell
him
and
he
say
you
have
no
fuck
right
to
talk
to
him
about
that
i
say
what
be
i
to
do
he
s
the
ceo
if
he
call
me
and
say
talk
me
through
this
compensation
be
i
suppose
to
tell
him
i
m
under
instruction
from
you
not
to
talk
to
him
let
me
help
you
and
then
you
can
tell
him
and
from
that
moment
it
be
like
we
be
on
different
side
of
the
world
ellison
say
ray
would
experiment
with
different
compensation
idea
and
sale
force
organization
every
year
one
of
the
bad
idea
i
can
remember
be
when
ray
decide
we
didn
t
do
enough
sell
through
partner
the
sale
force
convince
him
that
the
way
to
fix
this
be
to
pay
more
money
to
the
sale
force
if
the
deal
go
through
a
partner
than
if
the
deal
come
directly
to
oracle
for
example
if
you
sell
a
million
dollar
deal
directly
oracle
would
get
a
million
dollar
and
you
would
get
a
commission
but
if
you
sell
a
million
dollar
deal
through
a
partner
oracle
would
get
and
you
would
get
a
commission
needle
to
say
our
sale
force
push
as
many
deal
as
they
could
through
partner
that
year
so
the
partner
be
happy
the
sale
force
get
high
commission
payment
for
go
through
partner
so
they
be
happy
the
only
loser
be
oracle
corporation
we
end
up
pay
huge
partner
bonus
and
large
sale
commission
so
our
sale
margin
go
down
the
only
possible
justification
for
this
extra
pay
for
partner
deal
be
if
the
partner
start
bring
in
large
number
of
deal
on
their
own
but
they
didn
t
our
sale
manager
convert
ray
to
the
fundamental
belief
that
the
best
way
to
change
the
behavior
of
our
sale
force
be
to
pay
for
it
so
when
ray
want
to
encourage
well
cooperation
among
our
different
sale
group
he
decide
to
pay
multiple
group
on
the
same
deal
we
have
industry
sale
team
product
sale
team
geographic
sale
team
global
sale
manager
etc
all
could
get
paid
on
the
same
deal
they
wouldn
t
split
a
commission
no
no
no
instead
we
d
pay
double
commission
triple
commission
and
so
on
but
ray
told
me
not
to
worry
because
we
could
afford
to
pay
everybody
on
the
same
deal
so
long
as
we
raise
everybody
s
quota
i
say
ray
pay
people
for
thing
they
don
t
sell
be
not
a
good
idea
raise
quota
be
not
a
good
idea
so
one
of
the
very
first
thing
i
do
when
i
take
over
the
sale
comp
plan
be
eliminate
most
double
compensation
on
deal
it
allow
us
to
bring
quota
down
dramatically
and
it
smoke
out
the
people
who
be
make
a
living
get
paid
on
other
people
s
deal
but
something
else
happen
when
i
take
control
of
the
comp
plan
when
ray
lose
the
power
to
pay
the
salesperson
he
lose
most
of
his
influence
in
the
organization
that
still
report
to
him
the
final
nail
in
lane
s
coffin
be
the
unheralded
arrival
in
april
of
safra
catz
a
former
investment
banker
from
donaldson
lufkin
and
jenrette
acquire
in
by
credit
suisse
first
boston
who
have
cover
the
software
industry
since
the
year
oracle
have
go
public
and
who
have
become
a
close
friend
and
admirer
of
ellison
catz
a
petite
black
haired
israeli
american
have
come
to
take
ron
wohl
s
old
job
as
ellison
s
chief
of
staff
ellison
have
be
keen
to
hire
her
for
some
time
but
have
initially
thought
she
might
run
one
of
the
company
he
have
recently
bought
in
israel
but
catz
make
it
clear
that
if
she
be
go
to
work
for
ellison
in
any
capacity
it
would
be
at
oracle
itself
disillusion
by
the
investment
hysteria
over
dot
com
firm
that
have
little
or
no
proprietary
technology
she
be
ready
to
quit
banking
she
suggest
to
ellison
that
she
could
come
and
do
corporate
development
a
role
that
be
vacant
follow
the
departure
of
the
able
david
roux
to
run
the
interactive
television
company
liberate
technology
catz
have
be
an
oracle
partisan
for
year
i
be
already
on
the
oracle
bandwagon
i
say
that
if
pet
com
or
ariba
trade
at
those
kind
of
number
then
oracle
s
worth
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
time
that
this
be
kind
of
the
center
of
the
universe
right
not
wall
street
you
want
to
be
in
the
sun
this
be
the
sun
i
thought
you
know
shame
on
me
if
i
don
t
try
this
and
of
course
i
thought
larry
be
great
awesome
with
this
ability
to
think
without
wall
catz
didn
t
have
any
operational
experience
but
ellison
quickly
realize
that
she
have
precisely
the
combination
of
quality
that
he
need
to
help
him
run
oracle
as
a
lawyer
she
have
an
almost
forensic
approach
to
dig
out
information
while
her
thirteen
year
as
an
investment
banker
have
left
her
with
finely
hone
analytical
skill
she
say
i
come
in
with
absolutely
no
agenda
other
than
to
help
larry
that
actually
make
my
job
incredibly
easy
if
larry
want
something
do
now
it
happens
because
i
m
go
to
check
that
it
have
that
be
the
thing
that
be
really
miss
larry
would
make
a
decision
and
nobody
would
check
that
it
have
be
carry
out
people
would
hope
that
because
he
have
so
many
thing
to
do
he
would
forget
the
first
thing
she
do
on
her
arrival
be
analyze
previous
year
budget
in
the
light
of
those
submit
for
the
next
financial
year
she
say
it
be
clear
we
be
spending
a
lot
of
money
for
no
good
reason
that
there
be
an
enormous
amount
of
duplicative
effort
and
overlap
objective
much
of
the
inefficiency
that
catz
found
she
laid
at
lane
s
door
we
have
any
number
of
initiative
in
place
that
when
i
get
up
the
actual
number
it
be
obvious
that
they
would
lose
us
money
ray
would
say
this
be
what
the
customer
want
to
buy
he
want
lunch
you
want
to
sell
him
lunch
i
be
look
at
this
stuff
and
say
to
larry
do
you
know
this
as
far
as
i
can
tell
so
far
i
can
find
at
least
million
we
ve
lose
ellison
say
safra
be
a
slave
to
fact
she
be
unwilling
or
at
the
very
least
extremely
uncomfortable
about
make
decision
without
the
fact
not
all
manager
be
like
that
some
manager
rely
on
their
gut
to
help
them
with
difficult
decision
especially
if
the
fact
be
hard
to
find
the
fundamental
clash
between
ray
and
safra
be
that
safra
dug
out
the
correct
fact
while
ray
rely
on
what
people
told
him
in
an
argument
when
nobody
have
any
fact
and
i
ve
see
a
lot
of
those
the
person
with
the
strong
personality
win
but
when
one
person
have
the
fact
and
the
other
doesn
t
the
one
with
the
fact
always
win
when
both
people
have
the
fact
there
s
no
argument
safra
never
try
to
embarrass
ray
in
a
meeting
he
just
kept
say
this
be
true
or
that
be
true
and
she
would
say
no
i
don
t
think
that
s
true
and
here
s
why
it
be
painful
to
watch
that
of
course
be
not
how
lane
see
it
safra
just
arrive
i
have
no
idea
who
she
be
there
be
no
introduction
safra
and
gary
start
work
together
and
appear
in
every
meeting
larry
would
ask
the
question
how
much
do
it
cost
to
do
this
or
that
and
she
would
go
out
and
write
in
the
headline
first
and
then
fill
in
the
rest
from
larry
s
perspective
all
the
while
catz
be
go
to
lane
s
people
and
pump
them
for
information
about
old
contract
and
sale
practice
that
found
its
way
quickly
back
to
ellison
lane
s
first
response
be
to
try
to
ignore
what
be
happen
to
his
authority
i
just
kind
of
say
maybe
if
i
just
continue
to
do
my
job
this
thing
will
pas
however
that
illusion
didn
t
last
very
long
in
february
lane
receive
an
e
mail
from
catz
inform
him
that
ellison
want
the
european
operation
under
pier
carlo
falotti

to
the

remarkably
for
the
first
time

to
raise
the
issue
of
what
be
happen
to
their
relationship
i
just
confront
him
direct
i
say
i
don
t
feel
good
about
it
you
have
move
organization
to
gary
what
s
wrong
he
say
nothing
nothing
you
and
i
just
have
to
spend
more
time
together
and
get
on
the
same
page
the
company
be
in
a
state
of
change
now
we
re
reengineering
business
process
and
all
that
the
ceo
have
to
drive
that
you
and
i
be
public
figure
see
by
a
lot
of
employee
and
we
just
have
to
be
on
the
same
page
and
spend
time
together
i
say
okay
great
i
totally
fell
into
the
trap
that
everybody
fall
into
when
you
have
a
meeting
with
larry
no
matter
how
depressed
you
be
you
come
out
happy
it
happens
over
and
over
again
the
next
time
they
actually
manage
a
one
to
one
meeting
be
in
lane
s
office
three
month
later
in
may
the
atmosphere
could
hardly
have
be
much
bad
ellison
have
recently
move
support
from
randy
baker
to
gary
bloom
and
lane
have
have
this
awful
meeting
with
safra
in
her
hunt
for
fact
catz
be
occasionally
find
lane
s
people
less
than
cooperative
lane
claim
that
when
she
thought
she
be
be
thwart
she
would
threaten
to
have
the
individual
responsible
fire
after
three
or
four
people
have
come
to
me
to
complain
about
be
threaten
i
go
to
her
and
say
safra
this
have
get
to
stop
this
be
no
way
to
behave
i
don
t
want
you
in
my
organization
when
i
get
do
she
become
totally
woman
tear
emotional
she
just
blew
up
she
say
why
be
you
always
criticize
me
why
can
t
you
and
i
work
together
i
say
i
just
come
in
here
to
tell
you
please
don
t
threaten
my
people
anymore
she
just
come
unglued
and
i
say
what
be
this
base
on
i
don
t
know
that
we
ve
actually
spent
two
minute
together
she
say
i
know
what
you
be
tell
people
around
this
organization
about
me
i
say
guilty
to
a
point
i
have
criticize
you
and
the
way
you
ve
work
here
but
it
s
not
something
that
can
t
be
rectify
we
end
the
whole
thing
by
hug
each
other
and
i
say
if
larry
would
agree
why
don
t
you
work
for
both
of
us
don
t
do
the
witch
hunt
but
work
for
both
of
us
i
probably
appear
to
be
the
most
naive
person
in
the
world
to
her
she
be
think
he
doesn
t
understand
what
s
go
on
i
think
she
be
clearly
promote
the
thought
to
larry
you
need
to
get
rid
of
ray
he
s
not
good
for
you
as
for
the
subsequent
meeting
with
ellison
it
take
much
the
same
course
as
the
one
in
february
lane
say
he
give
me
the
same
thing
we
hadn
t
spent
the
time
together
i
be
always
travel
lane
felt
strongly
that
his
absence
from
redwood
shore
be
more
than
justified
by
the
result
they
be
produce
in
november
oracle
have
announce
a
partnership
with
ford
to
build
an
internet
base
business
to
business
exchange
that
would
link
the
carmaker
to
the
many
thousand
of
company
in
its
supply
chain
over
the
follow
month
a
rival
exchange
plan
by
gm
and
the
software
firm
commerce
one
have
be
fold
into
the
ford
oracle
scheme
and
other
car
manufacturer
such
as
daimlerchrysler
be
also
prepare
to
come
on
board
under
the
term
of
the
deal
that
lane
have
negotiate
rather
than
simply
sell
software
license
oracle
would
be
a
minority
partner
and
provide
some
of
the
operational
management
lane
estimate
that
within
a
few
year
covisint
as
it
be
later
name
would
handle
transaction
worth
ten
of
billion
of
dollar
a
year
rake
off
a
small
commission
for
each
one
the
plan
be
to
float
covisint
as
an
independent
entity
at
a
time
when
the
name
your
price
airline
ticket
exchange
priceline
com
have
a
market
value
great
than
the
combine
worth
of
the
airline
whose
seat
it
sell
the
idea
that
oracle
would
be
a
stakeholder
in
b
b
as
they
become
know
exchange
across
a
range
of
industry
have
an
electrify
effect
on
its
stock
price
lane
say
all
that
stuff
be
go
on
in
the
background
at
the
same
time
that
the
gary
safra
show
be
undermine
me
i
personally
take
credit
for
the
run
up
of
oracle
stock
that
happen
then
as
soon
as
the
market
realize
that
we
be
a
real
b
b
player
our
stock
take
the
run
up
that
we
d
always
be
wait
for
it
go
from
forty
dollar
to
eighty
dollar
overnight
two
month
later
lane
receive
the
call
from
ellison
that
would
bring
his
relationship
with
oracle
to
an
end
soon
after
that
safra
catz
renegotiate
oracle
s
position
within
the
covisint
consortium
to
that
of
pure
software
supplier
she
and
ellison
have
decide
that
as
a
risk
share
partner
within
an
increasingly
unwieldy
alliance
of
competitor
company
and
at
a
time
when
the
initial
euphoria
about
the
prospect
of
b
b
exchange
be
fast
deflate
there
be
a
very
good
chance
that
oracle
would
never
see
a
penny
from
the
deal
that
lane
have
be
so
proud
of
what
should
be
the
final
verdict
on
ray
lane
s
eight
year
at
oracle
his
outstanding
achievement
make
oracle
a
company
that
learn
to
care
about
its
customer
and
to
preside
over
the
creation
of
a
large
powerful
consult
organization
however
even
in
these
area
the
record
be
not
unambiguous
while
he
do
a
good
job
cleaning
up
though
by
no
mean
clearing
out
the
cowboy
u
s
sale
force
his
attempt
to
overhaul
the
culturally
very
different
european
operation
add
considerable
cost
without
any
obvious
gain
in
effectiveness
perhaps
the
big
myth
about
lane
which
he
be
happy
to
propagate
be
that
he
be
the
discipline
process
orient
manager
who
make
the
train
at
oracle
run
on
time
in
contrast
to
ellison
the
impulsive
visionary
the
truth
be
that
until
ellison
become
interested
in
master
the
nut
and
bolt
of
process
as
a
precondition
to
understand
how
such
thing
could
be
automate
neither
of
them
be
pay
much
attention
to
the
thing
they
should
have
be
both
be
essentially
do
what
they
like
best
ellison
kept
oracle
at
the
lead
bleeding
edge
technologically
lane
work
corporate
america
and
brought
home
the
big
deal
many
of
the
people
i
spoke
to
about
lane
be
highly
critical
of
the
negative
way
he
have
spoken
about
oracle
since
leave
include
give
aid
and
succor
to
the
enemy
by
appear
as
a
guest
speaker
at
sap
s
annual
sapphire
convention
it
s
undignified
they
say
particularly
when
you
consider
the
billion
or
so
dollar
lane
make
during
his
time
at
oracle
they
have
a
point
but
give
the
way
ellison
treat
him
during
his
last
two
unhappy
year
and
his
subsequent
trash
of
a
man
whom
he
have
once
be
prepared
to
entrust
with
run
the
great
part
of
the
company
it
s
not
really
surprising
what
be
more
surprising
be
how
little
lane
seem
to
understand
the
reason
for
the
deterioration
of
his
relationship
with
ellison
a
relationship
which
both
men
in
conversation
compare
to
a
marriage
despite
the
fact
that
they
be
never
close
friend
and
have
few
share
interest
when
i
told
lane
how
ellison
have
react
to
his
threat
to
jump
ship
to
novell
and
then
how
he
have
interpret
as
a
kind
of
putsch
the
suggestion
that
robert
shaw
should
take
over
application
development
and
report
to
him
lane
seem
genuinely
shock
after
one
of
our
interview
he
e
mail
ellison
thus
larry
i
think
it
s
unfortunate
you
feel
the
need
to
continue
to
trash
me
with
the
press
it
s
irrelevant
to
me
since
your
opinion
of
me
be
not
relevant
to
my
self
esteem
but
i
assume
you
don
t
think
i
m
credible
to
criticize
your
ability
in
lead
development
the
same
way
i
don
t
think
you
re
qualify
to
criticize
my
ability
in
sale
i
guess
we
can
both
continue
the
war
of
word
the
press
love
it
i
almost
picked
up
a
telephone
saturday
to
have
a
conversation
with
you
base
on
insight
matthew
symonds
give
me
about
now
i
know
why
you
start
behaving
the
way
you
do
and
end
up
fire
your
most
loyal
employee
it
s
a
shame
you
read
it
so
wrong
but
all
that
s
irrelevant
base
on
what
you
want
to
continue
to
tell
the
public
which
cause
me
to
do
the
same
seem
a
more
typical
divorce
every
day
unfortunate
ray
lane
even
ask
me
whether
i
would
broker
a
meeting
between
him
and
ellison
he
suggest
that
i
should
act
as
a
marriage
guidance
counselor
help
the
two
of
them
to
understand
what
have
go
wrong
between
them
i
m
not
sure
that
lane
be
look
for
a
reconciliation
with
ellison
but
rather
some
kind
of
closure
despite
all
the
signal
he
get
that
he
no
longer
have
ellison
s
professional
respect
and
the
fact
that
a
full
twelve
month
have
pass
since
ellison
have
fire
him
his
ego
be
unable
to
come
to
term
with
what
have
happen
he
also
quite
clearly
wish
he
have
handle
ellison
differently
lane
told
me
i
regret
that
i
didn
t
work
on
a
one
to
one
relationship
with
larry
i
ask
ellison
what
he
thought
of
the
idea
of
meeting
lane
with
me
his
response
be
that
he
might
be
more
receptive
if
lane
weren
t
support
an
age
discrimination
lawsuit
against
oracle
that
have
be
brought
by
randy
baker
but
even
without
that
obstacle
i
don
t
think
it
s
something
that
ellison
would
have
want
to
do
combine
with
his
dislike
of
emotional
confrontation
he
really
didn
t
see
much
point
in
see
lane
again
the
last
word
on
what
pass
between
lane
and
ellison
should
go
to
the
scrupulously
fair
jeff
henley
larry
get
very
excite
about
the
idea
of
automate
all
of
oracle
this
be
big
stuff
man
something
i
can
get
my
teeth
into
which
be
great
but
it
s
a
shame
that
ray
become
the
fall
guy
because
i
never
saw
ray
really
try
to
make
larry
look
bad
or
work
against
him
ray
be
critical
of
larry
at
time
as
i
have
be
perhaps
more
critical
than
me
because
he
have
to
deal
with
all
those
damn
customer
who
be
mad
at
us
but
he
be
just
try
to
make
sure
the
product
get
well
that
be
his
whole
goal
ray
s
a
good
guy
and
he
do
a
lot
for
oracle
but
larry
be
also
absolutely
right
in
get
involve
and
expose
a
lot
of
nutty
thing
there
be
some
area
like
support
and
education
that
to
be
honest
ray
didn
t
spend
any
time
on
ray
be
a
little
thin
skin
about
that
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
some
of
that
stuff
be
really
screw
up
and
i
think
ray

clear
to
everyone
that
this

have
end
a

at

suddenly
i
m
competent
to

how
many
successful
ceo
i
reflect
who
have
built
their
company
from
scratch
over
more
than
two
decade
and
at
the
age
of
fifty
six
would
declare
themselves
in

something
about

may
have
be
his
great
service
to
the

from
that
a
great

else
would
follow
just
as
ellison
by
his
own
admission
have
never
really
want
to
be
a
ceo
never
really
want
to
run
a
company
for
similar
reason
he
have
never
have
any
real
interest
in
application
as
he
say
i
thought
understand
business
process
be
dull
and
automate
them
even
duller
however
with
his
reputation
on
the
line
as
the
new
mr
application
there
be
nothing
halfhearted
about
the
way
he
threw
himself
into
learn
about
the
business
when
ellison
talk
about
the
experience
he
do
so
with
something
approach
religious
fervor
it
really
be
a
crisis
situation
i
felt
my
job
be
at
stake
the
company
would
survive
but
i
might
not
anyway
it
be
about
six
month
before
release
be
due
to
come
out
and
everyone
be
very
concerned
about
fix
bug
and
improve
product
quality
so
i
start
have
regular
application
quality
meeting
the
meeting
start
about
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
ran
until
to
eight
or
nine
o
clock
in
the
even
we
quickly
make
progress
fix
bug
so
i
move
on
to
ask
a
lot
of
question
about
what
our
application
actually
do
i
have
no
idea
i
never
use
them
wait
a
second
i
m
the
ceo
how
come
i
ve
never
use
our
application
can
someone
explain
that
to
me
please
i
never
get
a
good
answer
but
i
finally
figure
it
out
oracle
sap
and
the
rest
of
the
erp
vendor
don
t
make
application
for
ceo
ceo
just
aren
t
important
enough
erp
application
be
built
for
clerk
i
ll
never
forget
my
early
day
in
application
this
large
aerospace
company
be
do
an
evaluation
to
decide
whose
application
they
be
go
to
buy
they
have
a
huge
amphitheater
fill
with
clerk
mainly
low
level
purchasing
people
and
they
be
compare
our
application
to
peoplesoft
s
application
base
on
keystroke
whoever
need
few
keystroke
to
enter
a
purchase
request
have
the
best
application
it
be
like
a
time
and
motion
study
from
the
s
if
we
require
twenty
six
keystroke
and
they
require
twenty
four
keystroke
they
have
the
well
application
i
thought
they
be
joking
the
most
important
thing
in
purchasing
be
buying
thing
for
less
you
ve
get
to
identify
your
low
quality
supplier
so
you
can
throw
their
as
out
and
move
their
volume
to
the
good
supplier
of
course
before
you
give
the
good
guy
the
additional
volume
you
beat
the
crap
out
of
them
so
you
get
a
well
price
nobody
in
their
right
mind
be
go
to
spend
a
fortune
put
in
a
brand
new
purchasing
system
just
so
they
can
get
rid
of
a
few
clerk
that
s
fuck
nut
our
purchasing
system
have
to
provide
the
purchasing
people
with
the
information
they
need
to
weed
out
low
quality
supplier
guy
who
deliver
late
that
kind
of
stuff
and
negotiate
the
best
possible
price
from
the
good
supplier
we
do
that
right
oh
no
nobody
do
that
we
automate
the
process
of
enter
purchasing
request
approve
the
purchase
request
send
the
purchase
order
to
the
supplier
the
entire
purchase
to
pay
flow
the
people
who
decide
what
software
they
want
to
use
to
automate
the
process
be
the
people
who
will
be
use
the
system
the
clerk
decide
what
do
the
ceo
think
about
this
i
mean
how
much
you
spend
buying
stuff
be
a
big
deal
you
d
think
the
ceo
or
the
cfo
would
be
deep
into
this
i
just
can
t
believe
they
re
go
to
spend
all
this
money
on
a
new
purchasing
process
automation
system
without
make
sure
that
they
be
get
a
great
information
system
to
go
along
with
it
but
they
do
because
erp
vendor
don
t
make
information
system
so
i
have
this
radical
idea
we
type
stuff
into
our
application
we
should
be
able
to
get
stuff
out
i
say
it
just
like
that
when
we
type
stuff
into
our
application
it
go
into
our
database
i
know
the
data
s
in
there
we
should
be
able
to
get
it
out
in
a
useful
form
i
want
all
our
process
automation
system
to
come
with
tightly
integrate
information
system
it
s
so
simple
what
s
wrong
with
you
guy
it
take
a
while
to
dawn
on
me
just
how
hard
the
problem
be
company
have
so
many
system
they
can
t
see
the
forest
for
the
tree
company
have
lot
of
separate
process
automation
system
each
with
their
own
separate
database
simple
example
oracle
have
seventy
separate
hr
system
each
with
its
own
database
to
find
out
how
many
people
work
at
oracle
you
have
to
look
into
seventy
separate
database
if
we
have
one
hr
database
we
d
know
but
we
have
seventy
now
seventy
hr
system
cost
a
lot
more
than
one
hr
system
so
we
be
pay
extra
not
to
know
why
be
we
do
that
i
felt
like
an
idiot
but
it
be
bad
than
that
our
hr
system
kept
track
of
all
our
employee
our
sale
system
kept
track
of
all
our
sale
employee
because
the
system
be
separate
every
salesperson
have
to
be
enter
into
both
system
when
a
salesperson
move
from
one
group
to
another
both
database
have
to
be
update
the
duplicate
data
entry
be
expensive
but
bad
yet
it
often
wasn
t
do
the
sale
database
might
be
kept
up
to
date
while
the
hr
database
wasn
t
so
we
have
conflict
and
inconsistent
data
if
we
have
one
database
that
kept
track
of
our
people
we
would
eliminate
the
duplicate
data
entry
and
the
inconsistent
data
with
all
these
separate
database
we
be
pay
extra
for
inconsistent
data

extra
not
to
know
we
have
hundred
of
separate

you
couldn
t
ask
any
question
because
your
information
be
so
badly
fragment
your
purchasing
information
be
over
here
your
quality
database
be
over
there
so
it
wasn
t
easy
to
find
out
who
your
low
quality
supplier
be
and
all
the
problem
seem
to
have
the
same
source
too
many
separate
system
too
many
separate
database
it
really
be
a
stun
discovery
all
these
separate
process
automation
system
have
to
be
integrate
and
sit
on
top
of
one
database
then
and
only
then
can
we
have
a
true
information
system
and
we

save
a

by
get

wall
he
say
why
isn
t
all
this
data
in
one
place
we
have
the
internet
now
right
we
can
consolidate
this
into
one
global
schema
that
be
the
spark
ellison
continue
take
over
application
at
the
same
time
we
be
move
our
database
and
tool
to
an
internet
architecture
be
serendipity
in
a
fairly
short
time
the
right
application
strategy
become
obvious
it
be
a
horrifyingly
big
job
it
wasn
t
go
to
be
a
short
ride
but
then
neither
be
building
real
application
cluster
game
set
and
match
in
the
database
business
building
all
our
application
around
a
single
database
building
a
single
integrate
global
information
system
that
s
game
set
and
match
in
the
application
business
this
be
ellison
s
epiphany
it
be
not
just
a
question
of
suddenly
understand
how
oracle
need
to
go
about
develop
its
application
to
make
them
both
well
than
and
different
from
the
competition
s
it
be
also
about
how
oracle
itself
could
become
a
different
kind
of
organization
and
how
ellison
could
reinvent
himself
as
a
ceo
ellison
s
other
realization
as
he
become
increasingly
involve
in
application
development
be
that
in
try
to
consolidate
system
and
get
business
intelligence
out
of
them
just
as
much
effort
would
have
to
go
into
well
process
ellison
say
it
be
like
a
yin
yang
diagram
that
show
how
one
opposite
produce
another
well
information
allows
you
to
improve
your
process
the
more
complete
your
process
the
well
your
information
it
s
a
virtuous
cycle
all
of
a
sudden
the
thing
that
he
have
always
assume
be
intellectually
beneath
him
become
very
interest
indeed
ellison
share
his
revelation
with
senior
colleague
during
a
strategy
meeting
in
march
at
the
hotel
nikko
a
stone
s
throw
from
san
francisco
s
union
square
mark
jarvis
who
become
head
of
marketing
a
month
later
remembers
the
occasion
well
we
have
the
head
of
sale
for
all
the
region
the
head
of
consult
ray
larry
the
head
of
development
and
a
few
other
people
include
myself
the
sale
force
start
off
by
say
that
in
the
database
business
we
can
beat
anyone
because
we
can
differentiate
ourselves
but
in
the
apps
business
whatever
sap
say
we
say
they
didn
t
have
feature
to
sell
that
you
couldn
t
get
in
sap
so
larry
stand
up
and
say
you
re
all
wrong
we
lose
because
clerical
administrator
don
t
like
our
product
all
these
wonderful
feature
you
want
be
irrelevant
because
all
they
care
about
be
the
user
interface
and
the
number
of
keystroke
larry
s
insight
be
to
change
the
game
by
say
that
instead
of
just
talk
about
transaction
we
have
to
start
talk
about
extract
business
intelligence
from
our
application
instead
of
talk
about
keystroke
to
executive
who
never
use
the
application
we
should
start
ask
do
you
know
this
and
do
you
know
that
about
your
business
the
idea
in
marketing
term
be
to
move
up
a
ladder
if
everybody
else
be
on
one
rung
of
the
ladder
you
move
to
the
rung
above
them
with
a
different
message
the
next
rung
of
the
application
ladder
for
us
be
business
intelligence
and
we
built
a
campaign
around
do
you
know
then
after
six
month
when
sap
start
talk
about
business
intelligence
too
we
move
up
the
next
rung
and
start
hammer
on
the
internet
it
be
a
very
big
turn
point
even
before
we
have
the
product
it
begin
to
change
our
ability
to
compete
with
sap
ellison
s
excitement
be
almost
unbounded
in
his
own
mind
he
d
not
only
work
out
how
to
make
oracle
s
perennially
underperform
application
business
into
a
winner
but
simultaneously
it
have
be
reveal
to
him
how
oracle
could
become
a
dramatically
more
efficient
company
and
how
the
ceo
s
job
which
he
have
spurn
would
now
be
worth
do
well
still
what
would
make
it
all
possible
would
be
leverage
the
internet
and
the
thing
that
oracle
understood
well
than
any
other
software
firm
in
the
world
the
relational
database
nor
be
there
any
question
of
have
to
put
reengineering
the
company
onto
a
back
burner
because
of
the
need
to
sort
out
application
one
would
lead
directly
to
the
other
oracle
would
become
a
giant
test
bed
for
its
own
software
developer
and
what
well
way
to
demonstrate
the
come
revolution
than
to
make
the
much
malign
ron
wohl
responsible
for
put
ellison
s
idea
into
action
ellison
say
i
decide
to
make
ron
our
cio
i
say
ron
we
re
go
to
test
our
new
application
inside
oracle
i
m
go
to
turn
our
entire
company
into
a
laboratory
if
the
application
be
any
good
they
should
save
us
a
lot
of
money
and
for
the
first
time
i
ll
actually
know
and
be
able
to
control
what
s
go
on
inside
the
company
although
ellison
have
be
tout
the
benefit
of
centralize
data
for
a
couple
of
year
and
have
be
cancel
client
server
development
right
and
left
since
in
favor
of
internet
related
project
the
operational
reality
at
oracle
be
very
different
from
the
marketing
message
while
a
few
high
tech
company
be
see
as
e
business
pioneer
dell
and
cisco
system
for
example
have
already
go
quite
a
long
way
toward
use
the
internet
to
put
key
business
process
online
include
their
customer
service
sale
and
supply
chain
oracle
be
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
pernicious
effect
of
client
server
compute
especially
as
practice
by
a
fast
grow
global
company
with
plenty
of
money
to
spend
although
some
of
the
application
that
oracle
be
use
be
by
now
web
base
and
everybody
who
work
at
oracle
be
connect
to
the
internet
and
use
e
mail
on
its
own
that
wasn
t
make
a
lot
of
difference
information
be
scatter
across
more
than
a
thousand
database
in
different
part
of
the
world
and
every
functional
organization
within
oracle
have
its
own
computer
system
replicate
naturally
enough
in
every
major
territory
ellison
say
we
have
hundred
of
large
server
computer
manage
hundred
of
separate
database
for
example
every
major
country
have
six
customer
database
one
each
for
marketing
web
store
telesales
field
sale
accounting
and
service
so
we
have
hundred
of
customer
database
we
have
seventy
human
resource
database
we
have
ninety
seven
e
mail
database
data
data
everywhere
and
not
a
drop
of
information
oracle
have
no
few
than
forty
three
full
fledge
data
center
around
the
world
each
one
stuffed
with
computer
hardware
and
each
with
its
own
it
staff
maintain
the
multiple
system
gary
robert
the
executive
ellison
would
put
in
charge
of
sort
out
its
it
mess
recall
we
be
actually
run
in
excess
of
customize
application
in
some
case
we
d
bought
third
party
product
to
do
some
thing
that
oracle
application
couldn
t
do
when
i
told
larry
about
the
number
of
server
we
have
around
the
world
two
thousand
in
europe
alone
he
almost
choked
and
that
be
just
counting
server
that
be
four
cpu
or
more
part
of
the
reason
be
all
those
customize
apps
you
have
to
have
test
environment
and
stag
environment
and
of
course
the
production
environment
itself
larry
have
one
question
that
set
us
all
back
on
our
heel
we
re
the
second
large
application
company
in
the
world
how
come
we
have
so
many
custom
application
and
if
i
need
these
application
to
run
the
business
why
aren
t
they
part
of
the
product
suite
we
look
at
each
other
yeah
that
s
a
damn
good
question
one
of
the
consequence
of
each
bit
of
oracle
have
its
own
computer
system
be
that
each
one
of
them
could
make
up
its
own
mind
about
how
it
want
to
do
business
ellison
say
every
country
invent
its
own
business
process
for
marketing
sale
service
everything
and
operate
the
way
they
deem
best
everything
be
nonstandard
both
ellison
and
lane
have
support
the
principle
of
have
strong
highly
autonomous
general
manager
in
each
country
but
the
combination
of
a
high
degree
of
decentralization
global
scale
and
the
functional
silo
form
by
client
server
result
in
a
structure
that
be
very
nearly
unmanageable
and
that
encourage
appal
duplication
of
effort
ellison
say
we
like
most
other
large
corporation
have
a
feudal
structure
we
be
organize
like
medieval
europe
i
be
a
weak
king
surround
by
a
bunch
of
strong
and
fiercely
independent
duke
i
would
sit
in
my
capital
in
california
and
make
policy
decision
which
the
duke
promptly
ignore
ellison
s
favorite
example
of
the
way
this
system
operate
be
the
work
of
the
supposedly
powerful
pricing
committee
chair
the
committee
which
set
price
for
all
of
oracle
s
software
use
to
be
a
pretty
thankless
task
the
pricing
committee
be
responsible
for
decide
how
much
we
would
charge
for
our
product
our
new
application
server
for
example
so
we
d
do
some
competitive
analysis
what
s
ibm
charge
what
s
bea
charge
what
s
microsoft
charge
how
do
our
product
compare
what
be
the
market
dynamic
after
that
we
d
make
a
decision
say
per
processor
we
d
then
produce
an
update
price
list
and
send
it
across
the
hall
to
our
global
sale
headquarters
unfortunately
our
global
sale
team
have
their
own
pricing
people
who
felt
they
weren
t
do
their
job
unless
they
do
their
own
analysis
and
for
the
good
of
the
company
of
course
correct
any
pricing
mistake
we
might
have
make
they
d
say
larry
s
an
engineer
what
do
he
know
about
set
price
we
re
salesperson
we
know
about
pricing
so
they
d
reset
the
price
to
per
processor
and
send
out
a
pricing
memo
to
our
european
headquarters
in
geneva
of
course
we
have
another
pricing
team
in
geneva
that
redid
the
analysis
and
reset
the
price
once
more
they
d
say
what
do
american
know
about
sell
software
in
europe
we
re
european
we
live
in
europe
so
a
team
in
geneva
decides
that
the
right
price
for
europe
be
per
processor
they
then
send
that
price
out
to
paris
munich
london
the
same
thing
happens
all
over
again
the
guy
in
germany
ask
what
do
french
people
in
geneva
know
about
sell
software
in
germany
the
right
price
in
germany
be
per
processor
every
country
have
a
different
price
it
be
crazy
we
have
about
two
hundred
people
around
the
world
involve
in
analyze
and
reanalyzing
set
and
reset
price
it
cost
us
a
fortune
in
duplication
of
effort
it
delayed
the
process
and
confuse
most
of
our
customer
but
not
all
of
them
one
day
i
get
a
call
from
one
of
our
large
customer
locate
in
the
northeastern
united
state
he
tell
me
larry
we
ve
decide
to
buy
all
of
our
oracle
software
from
oracle
brazil
i
say
but
you
re
headquarter
in
connecticut
connecticut
s
not
part
of
brazil
why
be
you
do
that
he
say
they
give
us
the
best
price
shit
everything
be
so
duplicative
and
decentralize
the
right
hand
doesn
t
know
what
the
left
hand
be
do
we
re
compete
against
ourselves
this
be
embarrass
i
realize
that
there
be
two
very
important
thing
we
have
to
do
neither
of
them
easy
first
we
have
to
move
as
quickly
as
possible
toward
the
ideal
of
one
company
one
database
then
we
have
to
complete
and
integrate
our
application
suite
that
meant
building
application
module
we
didn
t
have
like
contract
management
and
pricing
quote
if
you
have
gap
in
functionality
it
s
impossible
to
completely
automate
the
flow
of
data
through
a
business
process
if
there
be
manual
process
left
lurk
around
your
process
automation
system
it
mean
you
have
big
gap
in
your
information
system
incomplete
process
automation
cause
cost
problem
quality
problem
and
delay
incomplete
automation
be
almost
as
big
a
problem
as
data
fragmentation
take
the
flow
of
data
between
sale
automation
and
order
management
when
the
customer
say
he
want
to
buy
one
of
our
product
we
send
out
a
price
quote
and
a
contract
create
a
contract
quote
a
price
send
out
a
contract
negotiate
change
and
actually
enter
an
order
into
the
system
be

robert

we
take
all
the

move

also

the

that
at

there
be
a
certain
amount

it

it

you

just
run

what

you
know
about

but
we
be
able
to
sit
down
with
some
of
oracle
s
technical
guru
and
they
say
they
would
have
make
exactly
the
same
recommendation
as
us
so
that
legitimize
our
position
and
from
that
time
on
it

transform

the

of

their

critical

be
anathema
to
them
rather
than
just
mandate
the

and
then
wait
for
the
shift
of

every
time
a

miss
a

the
way
around
their
resistance
be
a
crafty
mix
of
financial
incentive
and
proof

that

the

ellison
want
to
establish
the
principle
that

have

their

second
ellison
identify
an
easy
to

that
would

immediate
proof
that
the

actually
work
global

instead
of

in

the

from

the

robert

now
go
to
have
to
do
something
much
more
difficult
than
globalize

despite
the
degree
of
professionalism
that
ray
lane
have
at
least
initially
brought
to
u

after
the
near
catastrophe
of

s
distrust
of

s
own

force
and
the
potential
for
trouble
that
stem
from
its
wheeler
dealer
way
be
largely
undiminished

the

could
help
restore
centralize

over

s
tower
of

like
marketing
operation
ellison
believe
that
an
internet
base
sale
system
could
not
only
make
sale
more
efficient
but
just
as
crucially
it
could
standardize
much
of
it
what
ellison
want
be
a
uniform
process
that
would
minutely
choreograph
every
single
step
of
the
sale
process
ideally
an
increase
number
of
sale
would
be
make
through
the
oracle
web
store
without
any
human
intervention
when
sale
prospect
visit
oracle
s
web
site
the
information

would
automatically
steer
them
toward
information
about
product
or
service
that
might
interest
them
follow
up
e
mail
would
be
automatically
generate
to
keep
up
interest
and
to

whether
a

or
a

from
a

close

where
appropriate
some

could
be
instantly
share
with

and
hardware
distribution
partner
at
least
in
theory
the
price
post
on
the

would
be
the
standard
price
that
all
but
the
very
big
customer
would
pay
thus
avoid
the
hugely

consume
for
all
concerned
ritual
of
protract
negotiation
on
every
deal
a
by
product
of
this
transparent
sale
process
would
be
far
more
accurate
sale
forecasting
but
ellison
want
to
go
much
far
than
that
he
want
to
use
the
technology
both
to
help
change
the
entire
sale
culture
at

and
to
make
each

vastly
more
effective
he
say
i
want
to
get
the
creativity
out
of
the

process
if
you
want
to
be
creative
go
write
a
novel
i
want
to
engineer
the

process
i
don
t
want
the

people
spending
all
their
time
wheel

the
primary
function
of
our

be
to
communicate
and
quantify
the
business
benefit
of
our
product
there
should
be
a
carefully
engineer
step
by
step
process
for
most
common
sale
situation
like
sell
our
database
against
ibm
s
first
identify
the
decision
maker
and
enter
their
e
mail
address
into
our
sale
automation
system
second
send
them
a
set
of
key
customer
reference
case
study
show
how
much
customer
save
by
convert
from
ibm
db
to

show
how
they
get
well
performance
and
ran
on
low

third
send

a

quantify
their

in

if
they
pick

rather
than

finally
send
them
a
standard
contract
and
a
price
quote
if
we
have
an
engineer
proven
sale
process
we
will
sell
more
software
the
purpose
of
new

automation
system
be
to
allow
standard

to
be
define
and
implement

the

force
that
s
real
sale
automation
most
so
call

automation
system
simply
automate
opportunity
management
and
sale
forecasting
if
you
be
go
to
spend
a

on

automation
make

you

sell
not
just

ellison
add
an

sale
process
can
also
be
effortlessly
update
if
the

pitch
we
want
to
use
against
ibm
change
as
it
do
from
time
to
time
because
of
some
cool
new
feature
we
put
into
oracle
or
because
we
have
a
great
new
reference
i
want
every

to
change
the
way
they
sell
against

press
a

and
everyone

powerpoint
presentation
becomes
the
late

of
the

press
a

and
great
new

be
automatically
sent
to
our

prospect
press
a

and
the
new
demo
be
online
ellison
recognizes
that
application
can
t
be
sell
the
same
way
as
database
technology
but
instead
of
send
four
or
five
people
to
say
slovakia
to
demonstrate
those
application
they
know
something
about
and
think
the
customer
might
be
interested
in
why
not
use
cobrowsing
on
the
internet
to
run
the
demo
and
presentation
that
way
the
best
people
be
always
conduct
the
demo
the
customer
be
see
the
late
version
of
the
software
and
money
be
save
on
travel
expense
it
also
happens
to
be
a
pretty
good
way
of
show
customer
the
difference
between
client
server
application
and
apps
that
run
over
the

regardless
of
where
the

happens
to

be
unrepentant
about
the

by
rival
such

and
some
of
the
analyst
that
what
be
once
the
most
fear
sale
force
in
the
industry
be
be
dumbed
down
and
emasculate
many
of
oracle
s
top
sale
guy
they
say
have
left
to
join
other
software
firm
because
ellison
no
longer
allows
them
the
flexibility
they
need
to
do
their
job
it
s
typical
larry
they
say
because
he
s
an
engineer
he
think
that
everything
in
the
business
can
be
engineer
he
laugh
yeah
the
oracle
sale
force
certainly
be
fear
mainly
by
me
seriously
i
think
some
of
our
competitor
have
be
hire
our
old
cowboy
the
kind
of
guy
who
will
only
be
happy
as
long
as
they
have
horse
lariat
and
gun
but
i
ve
never
thought
that
our
very
best
salesperson
be
these
crazy
deal
maker
our
best
salesperson
be
very
knowledgeable
and
service
orient
i
love
and
respect
those
guy
and
i
want
more
of
them
i
want
a
sale
force
make
up
of
the
kind
of
people
you
d
want
your
son
or
daughter
to
marry
it
s
understandable
that
ellison
should
think
the
way
he
do
but
i
wonder
whether
george
robert
the
head
of
u
s
sale
and
a
former
prot
g
of
ray
lane
would
feel
the
same
way
do
he
feel
that
ellison
be
engineering
the
testosterone
out
of
sell
oh
god
i
think
that
s
a
ridiculous
assumption
i
think
that
what
larry
be
try
to
do
be
find
a
way
to
make
every
sale
rep
behave
like
an
a
grade
sale
rep
i
have
have
this
discussion
with
larry
many
time
and
what
i
tell
him
be
that
we
will
know
we
ve
arrive
as
an
e
business
when
we
release
the
product
and
the
next
day
forty
thousand
oracle
employee
can
deliver
the
same
value
proposition
around
the
globe
because
that
s
when
size
becomes
an
advantage
historically
as
company
get
big
they
become
more
inefficient
and
this
whole
e
business
effort
be
all
design
to
leverage
oracle
s
size
and
make
it
more
effective
all
around
the
world
i
have
seventeen
thousand
people
closing
that
million
deal
isn
t
go
to
solve
my
problem
for
me
but
if
i
can
make
seventeen
thousand
people
more
effective
in
their
job
every
day
that
have
a
real
impact
top
line
and
bottom
line
that
s
a
huge
win
doesn
t
robert
lament
the
passing
of
the
crazy
deal
maker
absolutely
not
he
say
we
want
to
make
sure
that
people
understand
our
key
differentiator
against
the
competition
what
our
value
proposition
be
and
how
we
then
match
it
against
customer
need
that
s
it
a
salesman
shouldn
t
want
to
cut
deal
okay
at
the
high
end
the
top
hundred
account
there
may
be
some
relationship
and
arrangement
but
as
you
move
far
downstream
the
more
standard
the
business
should
be
a
large
part
of
our
e
business
effort
be
aim
at
optimize
our
distribution
model
in
a
way
that
leverage
all
the
different
channel
a
customer
can
buy
through
that
s
tremendously
important
in
help
us
get
market
share
as
for
our
competitor
say
that
we
re
dumbing
down
they
re
nut
and
you
know
what
they
all
want
to
do
what
we
re
do
i
ve
have
a
dozen
company
through
here
in
the
last
few
month
one
of
them
be
bmc
a
software
company
and
there
isn
t
one
that
doesn
t
come
away
say
you
guy
be
so
far
ahead
of
anything
they
ve
see
even
if
they
ve
be
do
telesales
for
year
and
year
chuck
phillips
of
morgan
stanley
dean
witter
who
be
not
only
the
doyen
of
wall
street
enterprise
software
analyst
but
unusually
be
held
in
high
regard
by
ellison
take
a
balance
view
of
oracle
s
attempt
to
change
the
way
software
be
sell
he
believe
that
some
dumbing
down
be
necessary
just
to
make
thing
simpler
for
the
customer
buying
from
oracle
be
like
try
to
buy
a
building
rather
than
a
piece
of
software
i
think
larry
s
simplify
it
be
something
customer
like
but
i
don
t
think
he
ever
get
rid
of
those
high
testosterone
sale
guy
either
those
guy
be
still
very
important
for
the
big
deal
it
s
not
like
people
wake
up
and
decide
to
spend
thirty
million
on
the
web
site
you
need
hungry
guy
that
can
sell
and
sell
high
and
i
think
he
know
that
you
still
want
those
top
five
hundred
guy
who
know
how
to
move
mountain
and
who
won
t
take
no
for
an
answer
there
be
still
a
human
element
to
sell
software
not
everyone
at
oracle
be
as
enthusiastic
as
george
robert
about
the
change
many
of
which
be
be
driven
through
by
ellison
s
shadow
management
team
of
gary
bloom
and
safra
catz
accord
to
ellison
one
group
that
felt
particularly
threaten
perhaps
not
surprisingly
give
the
amount
of
independence
they
have
enjoy
under
lane
be
the
country
manager
in
europe
that
may
have
be
true
of
some
who
equate
their
power
and
influence
within
oracle
with
the
size
of
their
budget
and
the
autonomy
of
their
system
but
the
major
obstacle
to
change
the
way
thing
be
do
in
europe
be
the
man
whom
ellison
have
himself
chosen
to
run
emea
europe
middle
east
and
africa
a
polished
ex
digital
and
ex
at
t
executive
with
a
background
in
service
name
pier
carlo
falotti
after
join
oracle
in
falotti
have
built
a
substantial
european
headquarters
in
geneva
unfortunately
the
infrastructure
that
falotti
have
built
around
himself
be
extremely
expensive
to
run
while
contribute
little
to
revenue
as
ellison
demand
increase
cost
saving
falotti
force
his
manager
to
absorb
the
cost
of
the
service
that
be
be
provide
from
geneva
philip
crawford
a
tough
salesman
who
ran
the
very
profitable
british
business
until
be
fire
by
lane
in
for
overaggressive
customer
license
audit
say
the
problem
with
falotti
be
that
he
say
one
thing
and
do
another
i
sat
in
meeting
where
blatant
lie
be
told
about
cost
blatant
untruth
about
european
and
about
emea
cost
structure
when
larry
start
to
ask
for
low
cost
quite
understandably
the
answer
in
emea
be
that
the
country
have
to
eat
more
of
the
cost
of
service
in
the
united
kingdom
i
get
almost
zero
in
the
way
of
service
that
i
actually
want
safra
catz
recall
it
be
not
pleasant
deal
with
the
senior
european
management
team
i
think
some
be
well
intentioned
but
didn
t
know
what
to
do
the
guy
have
to
push
ray
s
line
that
they
couldn
t
change
because
they
d
always
do
it
in
this
way
ellison
eventually
fire
falotti
on
the
last
day
of
may
by
call
him
on
his
mobile
phone
the
date
of
his
dismissal
meant
that
falotti
lose
million
worth
of
option
that
be
soon
to
vest
to
avoid
that
fate
falotti
secure
a
note
from
his
doctor
state
that
he
be
ill
and
unable
to
work
as
of
may
for
an
indefinite
amount
of
time
accord
to
swiss
law
an
individual
can
t
be
sack
if
he
be
too
ill
to
work
suspect
a
scam
oracle
promptly
slap
in
a
lawsuit
against
falotti
argue
that
the
doctor
s
note
plainly
misrepresent
the
fact
so
far
the
legal
decision
have
go
against
falotti
his
consolation
be
that
he
have
already
make
nearly
million
from
the
earlier
sale
of
share
from
an
option
grant
another
senior
manager
who
left
as
a
consequence
of
ellison
s
e
business
crusade
be
ray
lane
s
old
chum
randy
baker
have
already
have
education
strip
from
him
in
early
because
of
the
dismal
percent
profit
margin
he
be
target
later
in
the
year
his
leadership
of
oracle
s
six
thousand
customer
support
organization
be
pass
to
gary
bloom
two
month
later
in
february
the
fifty
five
year
old
baker
be
fire
like
falotti
baker
believe
the
timing
of
his
sack
be
link
to
the
date
when
option
be
due
to
vest
he
sue
oracle
for
million
on
ground
of
wrongful
dismissal
and
age
discrimination
he
have
indicate
that
after
seven
year
service
he
want
to
leave
the
company
in
august
by
which
time
his
option
would
have
vested
but
ellison
have
other
idea
ellison
say
randy
and
pier
carlo
both
felt
they
need
more
people
to
do
a
good
job
i
didn
t
agree
i
want
randy
to
leave
because
his
margin
be
drop
like
a
rock
and
he
still
want
to
hire
more
people
what
s
more
important
to
me
profitability
or
someone
s
age
i
m
actually
slightly
old
than
randy
i
want
to
automate
cut
expense
and
improve
profitability
that
s
what
i
insist
on
it
prove
to
be
a
very
difficult
time
for
many
of
our
most
senior
manager
who
be
long
accustom
to
operating
independently
ray
lane
regard
both
men
as
among
the
fine
executive
he
have
ever
work
with
by

all

without

he

especially
proud
of

fact
that

of

keen
to

for

of

it

automation
that
meant
oracle
could
do
more
with
few
people
as
for
the
accusation
that
much
of
the

come
from

this
quarter
include
the
september
eleventh
tragedy
and
its
impact
on
an
already
weak
economy
in
a
difficult
economy
we
be
gratify
that
our
business
automation
have
allow
us
to
continuously
take
cost
out
of
our
business
while
expand
our
engineering
capacity
ellison
put
it
differently
it
be
our
toughest
quarter
in
a
decade
but
we
still
make
over
million
in
operating
profit
and
a
thirty
five
percent
operating
margin
when
the
economy
improves
we
will
earn
a
lot
more
ellison
be
point
out
two
thing
the
first
be
that
in
extremely
difficult
sell
condition
its
margin
gain
have
not
deteriorate
despite
the
fact
that
almost
alone
among
technology
firm
oracle
have
not
be
force
into
large
scale
layoff
in
the
second
be
that
when
business
picked
up
there
be
likely
to
be
a
nearly
one
for
one
relationship
between
increase
revenue
dollar
and
profit
ellison
believe
that
oracle
have
effectively
uncoupled
expense
from
revenue
growth
and
that
in
an
up
economy
oracle
be
capable
of
get
near
a
percent
margin
that
would
beat
even
microsoft
s
phenomenal
profitability
into
a
cocked
hat
software
be
as
much
a
catalyst
as
a
cause
of
the
revolution
in
oracle
s
business
practice
ellison
frequently
tell
prospective
customer
that
unless
they
be
prepared
to
review
all
their
business
process
in
the
light
of
the
internet
and
unless
their
top
management
be
willing
to
make
available
the
best
people
in
the
company
to
work
out
what
should
be
do
they
shouldn
t
buy
oracle
s
software
because
they
will
only
be
disappointed
by
the
return
on
their
investment
his
constant
message
be
don
t
change
the

to
fit
the
way
you
have
always
do

use

i
be
the
drive

behind
the
idea
that
the
way
we
be
spending
money
and
make
business
decision
at
oracle
be
lunacy
but
the
software
force
you
to
think
about
exactly
how
you
want
to
do
business
and
that
make
you
go
do
it
it
get
your
attention
and
it
s
very
powerful
ellison
believe
that
one
of
the
great
benefit
of
oracle
s
e
business
transformation
have
be
to
the
way
people
within
the

now
behave
oracle
have
be
a
company
make
up
of
many
independent

group
manage
by
these
self
reliant
generalist
who
value
their

now
it

a
company
of
interdependent
business
group
manage
by
specialist
who
value
their
knowledge
and
excel
at
teamwork
as
a
result
it
s
more
fun
to
work
at
oracle
these
day
and
there
s
less
management
conflict
because
decision
be

on
up

date

information
as

s
own
information
system
improve
ellison
be
increasingly
struck
by
how
executive
who
have
accurate
data
at
their
fingertip
be
able
to
overwhelm
manager
who
be
nominally
senior

them
who
didn
t
he
have

by
virtue
of

the
fact
i

watch
how
people
manage
how
they
make

how
they

someone

someone
who

the
day
the
more
we
know
the
more
rational
our
decision
and
the
less
we
argue
because
once
you
knew
that
certain

be
true
the
argument
be
over
it
s
really
quite
extraordinary
how
different
an
organization
becomes
when
decision
be
base
on
fact
rather
than
force
of
personality
rank
and
opinion
despite
his
enjoyment
of
controversy
ellison
doesn
t
have
a
great
appetite
for
argument
at
least
not
in
a
professional
context
while
he
s
always
prepared
to
listen
to
the
view
of
developer
when
they
differ
from

and
be
willing
to
be

he
doesn

about

issue
that
depend

ellison
be
a
self

hyperquant
who
feel
fully
in

only
when
he

even
when
he

fly

he
prefers

by
the

come
out

than
to
put
all
his
trust
in
what
he
s
feel
through
the
seat
of
his
pant
another
of
the
cultural
change
that
ellison
feel
proud
of
be
the
attitude
toward
budgeting
and
expense
that
he
insists
have
now
spread
through
the
company
an
approach
he
say
he
learn
from
close
observation
of
one
of
oracle
s
big
customer
ge
he
say
a
few
year
ago
when
we
have
a
budgeting
session
it
use
to
go
something
like
this
a
bunch
of
people
walk
into
the
room
there
be
a
big
pot
of
gold
sit
on
the
table
the
team
that
come
in
felt
it
be
their
job
to
use
all
their
rhetorical
ability
and
cleverness
to
leave
the
room
with
as
much
of
that
gold
as
possible
in
their
budget
my
job
on
the
other
hand
be
to
hold
on
to
as
much
of
the
gold
as
possible
the
fight
excuse
me
budgeting
session
would
go
on
for
day
and
day
it
take
a
long
time
for
them
to
explain
why
every
department
need
to
spend
more
money
than
it
have
spent
the
previous
year
i
say
wait
a
second
we
all
work
for
the
same
company
we
re
all
shareholder
here
why
be
i
the
only
person
in
the
room
try
to
hold
on
to
as
much
of
the
gold
as
possible
if
we
spend
less
gold
we
ll
make
more
money
that
s
a
good
thing
something
i
learn
from
work
with
and
watch
ge
over
the
year
be
that
ge
expect
its
manager
to
come
into
planning
session
with
budget
show
profit
margin
go
up
good
idea
now
every
manager
in
oracle
be
require
to
come
to
planning
session
with
a
first
slide
that
say
how
we
re
go
to
do
more
while
spending
less
the
rest
of
the
presentation
go
into
detail
as
to
what
you
re
go
to
do
this
year
that
you
didn
t
do
last
year
and
how
you
re
able
to
spend
less
while
do
it
during
hard
time
like
the
last
few
year
this
approach
to
planning
be
essential
if
you
want
to
have
any
hope
of
preserve
profitability
if
people
be
look
for
an
outlet
for
their
creativity
this
be
the
place
for
it
we
learn
from
each
other
we
no
longer
have
a
culture
in
which
people
think
that
the
more
money
they
spend
the
more
important
they
be
we
have
a
culture
that
finally
understands
expense
be
bad
the
change
that
ellison
have
driven
through
at
oracle
since
be
extraordinary
all
the
more
so
because
almost
nobody
who
knew
him
before
would
have
dream
that
he
could
ever
get
so
fascinate
by
every
mundane
detail
concern
how
oracle
operate
or
that
he
would
have
the
determination
to
drive
such
profound
cultural
change
through
a
large
and
far
flung
organization
once
the
first
quick
win
have
be
realize
nor
be
there
any
doubt
that
he
have
do
it
by
turn
oracle
into
an
e
business
laboratory
create
a
virtuous
circle
that
greatly
benefit
the
development
of
oracle
s
application
software
it
s
a
measure
of
his
success
that
during
the
last
technology
industry
downturn
at
the
begin
of
the
s
oracle
be
nearly
sunk
by
poor
cost
control
and
the
ensue
cash
crisis
whereas
in
the
tougher
business
condition
of
an
admittedly
much
big
oracle
remain
formidably
profitable
nonetheless
there
be
some
important
qualification
the
first
be
that
oracle
be
unusually
ripe
for
an
e
business
transformation
by
any
normal
standard
it
have
grown
extremely
rapidly
over
a
twenty
year
period
and
as
in
many
high
growth
company
control
expense
be
not
a
priority
it
have
also
adopt
a
highly
decentralize
model
partly
to
enable
it
to
establish
a
global
presence
quickly
because
it
be
a
technology
company
spending
large
amount
of
money
on
the
late
it
system
be
lodge
deep
in
its
dna
however
in
the
era
of
client
server
as
ellison
be
fond
of
say
today
the
more
you
spent
the
bad
it
get
thus
when
ellison
begin
his
campaign
to
standardize
centralize
and
automate
everything
that
move
at
oracle
he
quickly
realize
that
the
return
have
the
potential
to
be
spectacular
the
second
reservation
be
the
risk
that
have
create
system
that
have
turn
oracle
into
a
discipline
machine
capable
of
respond
very
quickly
to
input
from
the
top
ellison
may
be
in
danger
of
isolate
himself
from
the
influence
of
colleague
and
deprive
the
company
of
some
of
their
creativity
it
s
one
thing
to
curb
the
creativity
of
deal
crazy
salesman
it
s
quite
another
for
a
company
full
of
very
smart
people
to
become
obsessively
rule
base
ellison
be
clearly
fascinate
to
see
how
far
he
can
go
in
bring
the
principle
of
engineering
to
the
run
of
a
complex
business
there
be
a
danger
however
that
he
may
go
too
far
jeff
henley
articulates
some
of
those
anxiety
larry
have
played
a
very
healthy
role
in
come
back
in
and
cleaning
everything
up
but
my
worry
would
be
that
he
have
become
very
powerful
and
be
not
delegate
very
much
at
all
there
s
a
danger
that
he
s
try
to
control
everything
so
tightly
himself
that
he
ll
stifle
the
growth
of
the
company
it
s
nothing
immediate
because
he
s
do
much
more
good
than
harm
i
m
just
say
that
in
the
longer
term
he
ll
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
be
a
little
bit
more
inclusive
he
ll
disagree
with
me
that
we
can
t
grow
and
flourish
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
there
will
be
limit
because
of
the
approach
he
s
take
right
now
i
think
a
lot
of

obsess
with
this

every

we

the

that
everything

as
intellectually
excite
as
hell
to
him

he
want
to
get
right
down
to
the
low
level
of
detail
and
work
through
the

so
we
ve
be
make

well

get
so
deep
into

and
i
m
all
for
that
it
s
just
that
there
s
a
risk
that
larry

s
a
very
able
guy
will
choke
off

many
of

jeff

may

danger
although

open
to
idea
from
people
who
be
not
so
overawe
that
they
forget
to
express
them
but
as
ellison
candidly
put
it
he
now
us
oracle
as
a
laboratory
for
product
development
and
in
any
laboratory
some
experiment
be
bound
to
fail
he
need
colleague
who
be
not
afraid
to
tell
him
when
that
happens
the
final
qualification
about
oracle
s
story
of
transform
its
efficiency
by
use
its
own
e
business
suite
be
that
the
claim
be
only
partly
true
because
the
first
billion
dollar
of
saving
be
pretty
much
in
the
bag
before
i
be
finish
the
software
that
oracle
use
to
turn
itself
into
an
e
business
be
in
fact
a
combination
of
module
from
release
which
ship
in
late
and
a
number
of
customize
prototype
application
that
be
global
internet
base
system
a
key
element
of
the
e
business
suite
however
be
miss
the
underlie
information
architecture
include
the
vital
share
data
schema
that
be
the
basis
for
oracle
s
claim
about
the
tight
integration
of
all
the
application
ellison
say
that
s
absolutely
right
the
software
that
save
oracle
a
billion
dollar
in
the
first
year
be
a
combination
of
our
standard
application
product
plus
prototype
application
that
have
not
yet
be
integrate
into
the
e
business
suite
but
all
the
application
product
and
prototype
be
global
internet
application
system
it
be
these
system
that
become
the
drive
force
in
oracle
s
transformation
once
the
prototype
application
prove
their
worth
they
be
rewrite
and
integrate
into
what
would
become
the
e
business
suite
as
we
automate
every
part
of
oracle
just
about
everything
go
into
the
e
business
suite
so
be
it
a
stretch
for
oracle
to
brag
in
its
ad
that
it
have
save
a
billion
dollar
by
use
its
own
e
business
suite
not
from
ellison
s
point
of
view
for
him
the
process
by
which
the
suite
have
evolve
and
oracle
have
be
transform
into
an
e
business
be
utterly
symbiotic
but
in
one
sense
the
marketing
claim
be
mislead
the
reassure
message
to
prospective
customer
be
that
oracle
have
be
successfully
run
the
same
e
business
suite
that
they
would
buy
for
at
least
a
year
that
be
very
far
from
the
case
not
for
the
first
time
in
oracle
s
history
early
guinea
pig
customer
would
pay
a
price
for
take
too
much
on
trust
not
however
as
great
as
oracle
and
ellison
would
pay

le
writes
the
term
clerk
be
an
intentional
exaggeration
in
a
number
of
internal
speech
at
oracle
i
be
try
to
make
the
point
that
erp

deliver
very
little

they
be
process

good
at

they
be
terrible
at
provide

put
you

le

i
thought
that
a
major
test
of

should
be
the
lower
of

expense
within
month
and
consistently
thereafter
i
never

into
the

any

the

we

piece

balance
by
the
attack

the
skepticism
of
some
analyst
who
question
whether

the

clear
the

be
ellison

to
lose
over
the
next
twelve

he
come
pretty
close
to
do
exactly
that
in

that

when
announce

ellison

declare
that

not

a
platform
for

with
its
built

all
that

that
could
be

use
a
standard

the

ellison
described
it
be
packed
with
hip
sound
new

a

in
java

that
could
execute

most
customer
would
initially
buy
it
for
the
traditional
reason
increase

rave
about

no
more

you
have
the

straight
from
the

and
no
longer
have
to
use
a

similarly
grant
found
that
if
he
want
to
make
a
change
to
any
of
the

he
be
run
instead
of
have
to
upgrade
the

on
five

he
could
now
make
the
change
in

place
develop

like
this
make
all
the
sense
in
the

he
say
jeremy
burton
then
responsible
for
server
marketing
at
oracle
say
the
feature
that
be
important
now
be
scalability
and
reliability
but
over
time
customer
will
figure
out
what
this
internet
model
can
do
for

about

a

it

an

the
supposedly
much
improve

of
its

unfortunately
it
lack
a
reliable
operating
system
to
run
on

microsoft
be
still
labor
mightily
to
finish
the
long
overdue
new

of

that
it

would
finally
win

into
the

thus
into

in

that
for
all
microsoft
s
effort
to
become
an

player
it
claimed
that

be
one

most
difficult

important
anymore

the
free
operating
system
developed
by
the
open
source
movement
furthermore
oracle
in
partnership
with
hardware
company
such
as
sun
and
hewlett
packard
would
market
something
ellison
call
a
database
appliance
know
as
raw
iron
it
would
run
straight
out
of
the
box
use
a
strip
down
operating
system
raw
iron
didn
t
take
off
commercially
but
it
reinforce
the
idea
of
simplicity
versus
complexity
if
ellison
be
happy
to
describe
oracle
i
as
the
internet
database
he
have
no
difficulty
officially
christen
the
forthcoming
application
release
i
the
e
business
suite
for
ellison
i
would
be
the
summation
of
everything
he
have
learn
about
the
application
business
since
his
force
introduction
to
it
in
early
above
all
it
would
deal
conclusively
with
the
curse
of
fragment
data
that
have
begin
with
client
server
and
that
best
of
breed
have
exacerbate
regardless
of
whether
application
be
web
enable
or
not
apart
from
its
new
internet
compute
architecture
which
supersede
that
of
nca
and
the
new
suite
would
have
three
unique
characteristic
to
ensure
that
ellison
achieve
his
holy
grail
of
all
of
your
information
all
of
the
time
in
just
one
place
for
the
first
time
i
would
offer
tight
integration
between
traditional
enterprise
resource
application
that
manage
back
office
function
such
as
financials
hr
and
manufacturing
automation
with
the
newer
customer
relationship
software
that
ran
marketing
sale
and
service
in
addition
i
include
an
advanced
planning
suite
enterprise
asset
management
and
online
procurement
it
be
axiomatic
that
information
about
any
customer
transaction
supplier
transaction
or
internal
business
process
can
affect
every
part
of
the
organization
the
best
example
of
this
be
the
apparently
simple
one
of
order
from
sale
to
marketing
to
customer
service
to
supply
chain
to
production
just
about
everybody
need
to
be
able
to
access
order
information
to
do
his
or
her
job
properly
without
integration
between
front
and
back
office
software
the
ideal
of
order
information
everywhere
be
unachievable
the
second
claimed
point
of
difference
for
i
be
its
completeness
ellison
have
realize
that
data
fragmentation
be
not
the
only
reason
for
the
difficulty
user
of
enterprise
application
have
in
get
worthwhile
information
about
their
business
out
of
their
multimillion
dollar
system
another
be
the
problem
of
gap
in
automation
if
a
business
flow
be
interrupt
by
manual
process
at
any
stage
it
almost
always
meant
that
the
information
store
be
at
best
partial
by
attempt
to
provide
all
the
core
functionality
to
run
most
business
from
end
to
end
oracle
be
promising
seamlessness
and
with
it
the
speed
efficiency
and
responsiveness
that
be
suppose
to
be
inherent
in
the
idea
of
e
business
the
key
to
everything
be
the
seemingly
esoteric
concept
of
a
common
data
model
unite
every
piece
of
the
suite
every
module
and
there
be
about
of
them

be
write
to
the
same
share
data
schema
allow
semantic
consistency
for
example
the
definition
of
a
customer
remain
the
same
no
matter
from
which
application
the
information
be
come
and
could
thus
be
share
by
all
the
other
application
in
the
suite
as
well
as
a
complete
view
into
every

the
underlie
simplicity
of
the
architecture

design
not
only
to
make
the
gathering
of
useful
business
intelligence
much
easy
than
with
multiple
component
system
but
also
to
make
implementation
radically
easy
and
therefore
cheaper
and
quicker
the
scale
of
ellison
s
ambition
with
i
be
breathtaking
while
microsoft
boast
about
the

of
the

it

at
the

to

nearly
every
aspect
of
even
the
big
and
most
complex
multinational
company
s
operation
from
its
inception
more
than
four

well
as
a
new

at

percent
of
the

be
entirely
new
when
ellison
described
it
as
the
large
and
richest
software
product
ever
create
for
once
nobody
accuse
him
of
exaggerate
the
question
be
could
oracle
pull
it
off
although
oracle
first
start
talk
about
i
in
april
at
the
oracle
application
user
group
s
oaug
conference
in
san
diego
the
official
announcement
of
a
shipping
date
and
what
customer
could
expect
from
the
new
suite
have
to
wait
another
five
month
when
ten
thousand
oracle
user
show
up
at
the
fall
oaug
conference
in
orlando
to
see
ellison

all
they

his
image
beam
from
redwood
shore
on
four
giant
screen
many
of
them
be
also
disappointed
by
what
he
say
after
an
almost
perfunctory
fifteen
minute
ramble
throughout
which
he
appear
to
be
wrestling
with
an
uncomfortable
earpiece
he
declare
that
the
anticipate
november
launch
date
have
be
put
back
until
february
the

would
be
complete
only
when
the
crm
component
become
available
sometime
in
the
second
quarter
ellison
explain
that
technology
glitch
be
cause
the
delay
he
have
also
decide
to
include
a
brand
new
order
management
module
that
have
be
schedule
for
a
later

rather
than
bolt
on

one

for

s
apparently
casual
remark
about
the
decision
to
go
with
the
new
order

module
and
the
pressure
from

eager
to
get
their
hand
on
i
would
have
profound
consequence
but
the
immediate
aftermath
from

where

it
note
that

for

however
a
word
of
warn
of
course

must
now
deliver
which
the
author
have
some
doubt
about

its
somewhat
less
than
sterling
past
performance
in
application
the
meta
group
make
a
similarly
qualify
prognostication

somewhat
hamper
in
the
past
by
offering
that
lack
coherence
and
differentiation
have
recently
demonstrate
a
consistent
vision
although
it
remains
to

see
how
smoothly
its
plan

out
oracle
be
position
itself
to
aggressively
increase
its
share
of
the
overall
enterprise
application
market
the
analyst
be
say
that
for
pretty
much
the
first
time
oracle
have
a
potentially
appeal
story
for
customer
who
be
sick
of
bearing
the
risk
and
cost
of
integration
their
caveat
be
that
ellison
s
change
the
game
strategy
require
near
flawless
execution
oracle
be
on
a
roll
but
if
it
become
apparent
that
it
have
bitten
off
more
than
it
could
chew
the
company
could
expect
little
mercy
many
of
the
industry
analyst
regard
oracle
as
an
arrogant
company
that
have
never
show
much
interest
in
engage
them
in
dialogue
but
it
be
more
complicate
than
that
oracle
have
spot
what
it
thought
be
a
serious
conflict
of
interest
for
the
tech
consultancy
when
it
come
to
accept
the
single
data
model
concept
behind
the
suite
mark
jarvis
oracle
s
head
of
marketing
say
that
he
never
expect
an
easy
ride
i
thought
that
the
gartners
and
the
forresters
of
this
world
would
find
it
hard
to
accept
the
idea
of
buying
everything
from
one
vendor
if
they
no
longer
have
to
advise
client
that
you
need
to
buy
this
software
for
marketing
and
this
software
for
sale
end
up
with
buying
software
from
fourteen
different
vendor
they
will
be
out
of
business
their
advice
and
their
expertise
be
no
longer
important
you
also
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
some
of
those
firm
be
in
the
system
integration
business
too
so
we
be
threaten
their
revenue
on
two
front
the
financial
analyst
be
likely
to
be
more
open
mind
but
many
of
them
be
advise
people
to
buy
the
like
of
ariba
and
commerce
one
which
be
threaten
by
oracle
s
suite
strategy
so
they
have
some
vested
interest
too
however
the
initially
largely
favorable
analyst
coverage
which
oracle
suspect
wouldn
t
last
add
to
the
pressure
on
ellison
to
ship
i
there
be
pressure
of
a
different
kind
from
wall
street
because
customer
sit
on
their
wallet
when
they
know
a
radical
new
release
be
imminent
that
be
more
than
just
an
upgrade
from

stall
with

to

for

the
cost
in

postpone
or
even
lose
because
of
far
delay
in
i
be
unacceptable
if
that
meant
put
heat
on
development
especially
ron
wohl
and
mark
barrenechea
to
declare
the
software
customer
ready
then
so
be
it
as
ellison
frequently
say
about
himself
he
doesn
t
have
any
difficulty
in
make
decision
even
if
they
sometimes
turn
out
to
have
be
wrong
in
this
situation
he
conclude
that
the
risk
be
asymmetric
as
well
as
the
hit
to
oracle
s
enviable
earnings
momentum
with
its
inevitable
impact
on
the
company
s
heady
stock
price
if
oracle
be
see
to
be
struggle
critic
would
be
only
too
happy
to
declare
ellison
a
victim
of
his
own
vaunt
ambition
at
the
same
time
more
delay
would
give
rival
time
to
undermine
perhaps
critically
the
credibility
of
the
suite
concept
before
customer
have
even
have
a
chance
to
try
it
on
the
other
hand
push
i
out
of
the
door
before
it
be
finish
ran
the
risk
of
generate
a
raft
of
unhappy
customer
story
for
the
analyst
to
feed
on
but
maybe
that
wouldn
t
happen
the
certainty
of
a
launch
date
would
undoubtedly
concentrate
mind
maybe
i
would
work
perfectly
out
of
the
box
in
the
software
industry
it
be
not
unknown
for
miracle
to
happen
even
if
a
miracle
didn
t
happen
on
this
occasion
ellison
be
cynical
enough
about
the
development
process
to
believe
that
however
much
work
be
do
in
house
to
iron
out
problem
it
s
not
until
the
product
be
in
the
hand
of
real
customer
that
you
really
start
to
find
out
what
s
right
and
what
s
wrong
ellison
be
also
prepared
to
take
the
apparently
sensible
path
of
have
a
control
customer
release
and
stagger
the
launch
roll
out
first
the
more
mature
erp
part
of
the
suite
in
february
and
then
add
the
crm
module
and
the
brand
new
order
management
application
in
may
it
sound
prudent
enough
but
the
reality
be
very
different
in
the
first
place
oracle
be
break
one
of
the
cardinal
rule
of
the
application
business
don
t
release

to
customer
until
you
ve
try
run
on
it
yourself
while
much
of
i
be
base
on
the
custom
built
application
that
oracle
have
use
to
turn
itself
into
an

business
and
save
billion
oracle
would
not
have
time
to
move
its
own
operation
onto

before
it
begin
sell
it
to
customer
they
rather
than
oracle
would
be
play
the
guinea
pig
to
make
matter
bad
the
idea
of
a
control
release
to
early
adopter
customer
who
be
ready
to
trade
some
pain
for
the
gain
of
get
their
hand
on
the

before

strictly
adhere
to

the
introduction
of

as
part
of
that
process
if

come
out
later
they
would
not

lose
vital
time

firm
ellison
say
i
have
already
delayed
the
i
release
date
and
that
force
our
customer
to
revise
their
implementation
plan
there
be
tremendous
pressure
not
to
delay
again
our
customer
have
their
resource
all
line
up
and
be
ready
to
install
our
software
as
soon
as
we
release
it
it
be
a
bit
like
the
begin
of
world
war
i
once
the
troop
mobilization
begin
there
be
no
turn
back
under
the
circumstance
a
prudent
general
might
have
do
everything
possible
to
eliminate
any
unnecessary
risk
instead
ellison
decide
on
the
software
equivalent
of
a
blind
cavalry
charge
it
have
never
be
the
intention
to
put
the
new
order
management
module
into
the
early
release
of
i
the
idea
have
be
to
start
off
with
the
old
one
and
upgrade
customer
later
but
because
the
launch
of
the
whole
suite
have
be
delayed
somebody
suggest
that
it
might
be
possible
to
sneak
the
new
and
much
more
capable
system
in
at
the
last
moment
ellison
say
we
have
just
finish
a
complete
rewrite
of
our
order
management
system
it
be
a
huge
job
the
new
order
management
system
be
dramatically
well
than
the
old
one
but
it
hadn
t
be
test
yet
so
we
thought
it
be
much
too
risky
to
put
it
into
the
suite
then
someone
not
me
this
time
have
this
very
innovative
idea
let
s
put
both
the
old
one
and
the
new
one
into
the
suite
that
way
conservative
customer
could
stick
with
the
old
reliable
order
management
system
while
our
most
avant
garde
customer
could
get
the
benefit
of
the
new
one
cool
idea
unfortunately
it
turn
out
to
be
technically
impossible
but
it
be
a
hell
of
an
idea
and
ron
and
i
take
our
time
before
we
give
up
on
it
there
be
five
stage
to
the
order
management
decision
stage
one
we
have
time
to
put
the
new
order
system
into
the
suite
let
s
do
it
stage
two
no
too
risky
we
have
to
go
with
the
old
order
system
stage
three
let
s
put
them
both
in
absolutely
fantastic
idea
stage
four
fantastic
idea
but
we
can
t
make
it
work
stage
five
well
then
let
s
put
in
the
new
one
it
be
my
decision
it
s
in
my
nature
to
go
for
the
high
risk
high
reward
option
that
s
my
cross
to
bear
we
go
from
have
an
average
order
management
product
to
have
the
premier
order
management
product
on
the
planet
the
only
problem
be
that
it
be
brand
new
and
we
hadn
t
do
enough
test
ellison
have
no
illusion
about
how
critical
the
order
management
system
be
the
order
management
system
be
the
heart
of
the
sell
side
of
our
e
business
suite
order
management
be
the
funnel
that
capture
the
information
about
the
sale
the
well
your
order
management
system
the
more
information
it
capture
our
new
system
capture
all
the
detail
about
the
product
sell
contractual
obligation
payment
term
everything
it
manages
marketing
promotion
vendor
rebate
and
track
what
salesperson
should
be
compensate
on
the
deal
the
flexible
pricing
engine
handle
complex
and
arbitrary
rule
like
buy
two
and
get
the
third
one
free
and
the
automatic
configurator
keep
people
from
buying
the
wrong
combination
of
product
like
computer
component
that
won
t
work
together
it
s
a
great
system
but
when
it
first
come
out
it
have
a
lot
of
bug
ellison
be
not
act
on
his
own
however
ron
wohl
fully
support
his
view
that
put
in
the
new
order
management
system
be
a
risk
worth
take
wohl
say
technically
we
really
have
to
include
it
to
fulfill
the
objective
of
the

ellison
wasn
t
go
to
argue
another
mistake
in
the

that
a
handful
of
chosen

try
a

instead

it

run
on

consequently
the
severe
upgrade
problem
that
some

would
experience
after
the
official

masked
mark

we

completely
in

we

solve
their

for
them
we
be
do
seventy
to
eighty
percent
of
what
the
customer
should
have
be
do
himself
it
be
a
mistake
some

do
come
out

that

a

e
business
transformation
and
a
marvelously
clear
exposition
of
the
philosophy
of

that
have
driven
it
one
passage

to
the

to
do
to
eliminate

we
have
to
make
information
easy
to
find
and
easy
to
share
but
how
the
solution
be
quite
simple
if
we
put
all
our
information
in
one
place
a
global
database
on
the
internet
then
everyone
would
know
where
to
look
to
find
the
information
they
need
while
conceptually
simple
this
single
unified
database
approach
require
fundamental
change
to
our

it
turn
out
to
be
a
massive
engineering
effort
involve

of

but
when
we
finish
the
oracle
e
business
suite
it
be
the
first
and
only
set
of
application
to
work
with
a
single
global
database
we
also
developed
several
new
application
so
that
the

business

would
be
complete

the

get
around
that

have
release
around
five
thousand
patch
for

that
be
an
oversimplification
many
of
the
patch
be
to
improve
functionality
rather
than
to
fix

and
many
fix
multiple

but
the
five

stuck
in

of

gleefully
include

every

part
of
a

mark

the

until

of

increasingly
engage
in
a
feverish
attempt

produce

that
would
fix
the

that
seem
to
be
fly
at
them
from
all
side
it
be
all
make
much
bad
by
the
sheer
number
of

that
be
under
way
yet
there
be
little
air
of
crisis
at
redwood
shore
ellison
say
i
be
a
huge
new
product
so
i
knew
there
would
be
a
lot
of
bug
but
there
be
no
way
to
know
how
many
there
be
or
how
long
it
would
take
us
to
fix
them
i
thought
we
could
fix
most
of
the
bug
pretty
quickly
during
the
control
release
phase
i
be
way
too
optimistic
it
just
kind
of
get
away
from
us
and
that
become
a
very
big
problem
the
software
business
like
to
play
the
blame
game
when

its

inventory

have
be
the
cause
of
an

shortfall
not
so
say
i
nike
have
overcustomized
it
be
not
unusual
for
oracle
s
senior
executive
to
assume
at
first
that
customer
problem
might
be
the
result
of
shoddy
work
by

partner
they
also
have
plenty
of
anecdotal
evidence
that
ellison
s
well
publicize
argument
against
excessive
customization
and
his
plea
to
put
in

plain
vanilla

by
some

their

out
in

different

and
engage
with
the
early

at
an
executive
development
level
i
think
if
either
of
those
thing
have
happen
we
would
have
rapidly
found
out
that
it
wasn
t
do
as
it
be
it
take
us
until
november
to
realize
we
have
issue
here
and
to
start
to
mobilize
by
this
time
people
from

and
be
learn
about
issue
firsthand
but
what
ram
the
message
home
be
that
oracle
itself
be
at
last
begin
to
go
live
on
one
part
of
the
suite
after
another
by
december
oracle
be
run
financials
some
hr
field
sale
automation
and
telesales
on
i
barrenechea
say
the
next
really
big
push
be
to
get
in
contract
and
order
management
over
new
year
s
what
happen
be
one
of
the
most
dramatic
moment
i
d
see
during
my
five
year
at
oracle
everyone
except
ron
knew
that
we
could
not
place
an
order
with
the
new
system
and
larry
know
we
can
t
place
an
order
not
know
when
we
would
be
able
to
place
an
order
and
know
that
once
we
turn
off
the
old
bespoke
system
that
there
be
no
go
back
say
we
re
go
live
anyway
i
need
a
force
function
so
off
we
go
so
we
upgraded
and
oracle
go
down
we
be
down
for
fourteen
day
for
fourteen
day
that
january
oracle
could
not
place
a
single
order
it
be
frighten
but
we
get
it
to
work
larry
be
right
it
be
a
great
force
function
at
that
point
i
become
acutely
aware
of
the
customer
dissatisfaction
and
immediately
start
drilling
down
into
the
implementation
we
be
do
ellison
s
view
be
less
dramatic
we
knew
that
we
be
go
to
go
down
for
some
time
so
we
schedule
the
installation
over
the
christmas
new
year
s
holiday
i
have
decide
on
a
massive
big
bang
implementation
we
be
go
to
upgrade
all
our
software
at
once
i
never
ever
recommend
that
to
our
customer
but
i
want
to
get
all
our
late
application
software
instal
up
and
run
at
oracle
and
i
want
to
do
it
fast
we
should
have
do
it
before
we
release
i
to
customer
but
we
didn
t
okay
that
be
my
mistake
now
i
want
to
remedy
that
mistake
as
fast
as
possible
that
meant
instal
i
at
oracle
the
first
opportunity
we
have
the
fact
that
we
get
everything
up
and
run
in
a
couple
of
week
be
a
major
accomplishment
we
uncovered
a
number
of
problem
in
our
software
and
we
fix
a
number
of
problem
in
our
software
by
the
time
we
have
finish
the
oracle
implementation
we
have
fix
most
of
the
order
management
problem
a
revise
release
which
incorporate
everything
oracle

in

the

by

that

now
at

as
solid
as

in

that

make
significant
improvement
and
fix
as
a
result
the

be
now
sufficiently
stable
for
oracle
to
begin
use
the
crm

in
its

however
just
as
it

the

young

also
happen
to
be
the
president
of
the

application
user
group
which
be
lock
in
a
bitter
feud
with
oracle
about
who
have
the
right
to
stage
conference
the
user
or
the
company
in
oracle
have
take
over
the
conference
which
have
previously
be
run
by
the
database
user
group
launch
oracle
openworld
later
that
year
openworld
have
be
a
huge
marketing
success
the
number
of
attendee
have
go
from
or
so
to
event
that
regularly
pull
in
people
blowing
the
door
off
some
of
the
big
venue
in
the
world
mark
jarvis
reckon
that
with
the
e
business
suite
soon
to
debut
oracle
need
to
do
something
similar
with
application
the
issue
be
that
oracle
be
put
a
lot
of
executive
time
and
money
into
the
oaug
s
conference
but
not
get
enough
of
what
it
want
out
of
them
jarvis
say
the
oaug
ran
two
event
a
year
in
the
u
s
and
we
be
highly
restrict
in
what
we
could
do
at
them
the
oaug
insist
that
it
be
very
independent
for
example
they
didn
t
want
oracle
logo
and
signage
around
a
bit
odd
there
be
other
peculiarity
but
their
primary
goal
be
to
have
user
talk
to
other
user
while
our
goal
be
to
get
out
there
market
our
product
and
educate
people
on
all
of
the
new
stuff
the
third
factor
be
that
a
lot
of
the
guy
in
the
user
group
be
not
always
on
the
lead
edge
they
be
more
interested
in
run
a
version
of
our
software
from
three
year
ago
and
they
want
to
talk
about
that
whereas
of
course
we
want
to
always
talk
about
the
late
thing
so
that
we
can
get
people
upgraded
and
sell
them
more
stuff
we
be
at
cross
purpose
in
early
we
told
the
user
group
of
our
desire
to
run
a
conference
and
we
ask
them
if
they
want
to
be
part
of
it
they
take
it
as
a
declaration
of
war
the
result
be
a
stalemate
oracle
go
ahead
with
its
plan
to
hold
its
first
appsworld
conference
early
in
the
first
quarter
of
in
paris
and
new
orleans
the
oaug
continued
to
hold
its
conference
albeit
without
the
official
presence
of
oracle
executive
and
no
keynote
speech
from
ellison
jarvis
say
they
also
start
a
very
active
pr
campaign
against
us
continually
emphasize
their
independence
it
prove
very
successful
whenever
industry
analyst
or
press
want
to
find
out
how
oracle
customer
be
get
on
with
i
they
start
go
to
the
user
group
for
reference
rather
than
oracle
oaug
board
member
be
suddenly
be
quote
in
the
press
say
negative
thing
knock
whatever
we
be
claim
and
attack
the
company
s
whole
approach
they
want
to
point
out
to
everybody
that
they
weren
t
on
i
yet
we
d
be
say
in
all
our
message
that
people
be
start
to
use
i
and
they
d
be
say
but
we
don
t
know
anybody
who
s
on
it
they
provide
a
counterpoint
to
everything
we
say
if
oracle
hadn
t
be
vulnerable
to
criticism
because
of
the
early
i
quality
issue
the
damage
cause
by
oaug
s
revolt
would
have
be
easy
to
limit
but
with
plenty
of
people
happy
to
take
a
swipe
at
arrogant
oracle
for
claim
more
than
it
have
be
able
to
deliver
the
user
group
be
the
perfect
stick
to
beat
it
with
even
quite
early
on
oracle
could
have
point
analyst
in
the
direction
of
many
pretty
successful
i
implementation
if
they
d
be
interested
but
it
be
much
more
fun
to
get
the
horror
story
from
the
oaug
ellison
maintains
that
the
fight
be
never
with
the
user
as
such
but
with
the
user
group
management
some
of
the
officer
in
the
user
group
be
not
customer
or
user
of
our
application
at
all
they
be
independent
consultant
who
make
their
living
run
the
oracle
application
user
group
meeting
we
be
threaten
their
livelihood
by
run
our
own
meeting
it
be
unfortunate
that
at
the
same
time
we
be
have
the
quality
problem
with
i
we
be
also
have
the
spat
with
the
user
group
they
bash
us
every
chance
they
get
if
oracle
have
go
on
make
its
number
the
bad
blood
with
the
user
group
would
have
be
no
more
than
a
minor
irritant
even
the
fallout
from
the
buggy
early
version
of
i
would
in
all
probability
have
be
containable
but
on
the
eve
of
the
first
appsworld
show
in
paris
the
moment
when
oracle
have
plan
to
deliver
to
the
world
a
confident
message
about
its
win
application
strategy

of
almost
uniformly
gloomy

on

one
by
morgan
stanley

he
argue
that

forecast
in
december
of
to
percent
year
over
year
revenue
growth
in
its
core
database
business
along
with
percent
for

would
be
extremely
hard
to
achieve
give
the
fact
that
no
few
than
thirty
of

s
dot

have
go
bust
and
that
around

note
though
management
seem
confident
in
the
progress
oracle
have
make
thus
far
in
the
quarter
we
remind
investor
that
a
good
amount
of
the
quarter
s
business
remains
to
be
do
the
next
three
week
will
tell
the
tale
as
shareholder
chewed
over
the
possibility
that
ellison
might
have
exaggerated
the
extent
of

immunity

the
force
that

reiterate
that
it

by
its
bullish
forecast
a
few
day
later
in
paris
ellison
seem
unusually
nervous
and
fluster
the
main
theme
of
his
speech
be
on
the
folly
of
customize
oracle
s
software
and
why
it
be
well
to
buy
a
complete
suite
from
oracle
in
ellison
s
analogy
a
finish
car
that
you
knew
would
work
rather
than
a
bundle
of
kit
glue
together
by
mechanic
from
ibm
he
say
we
ve
work
hard
to
be
the
first
car
company
we
don
t
want
to
sell
you
part
and
labor
if
you
customize
our
software
when
we
bring
out
a
new
version
you
can
t
use
it
you
trap
yourself
in
an
old
version
ultimately
customize
the
e
business
suite
be
futile
because
oracle
itself
would
soon
add
the
functionality
customer
be
look
for
we
will
bring
out
a
new
version
of
the
software
before
you
can
finish
customize
our
old
version
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
the
familiar
argument
but
without
a
prepared
text
ellison
sometimes
put
thing
in
starker
term
than
he
and
certainly
oracle
s
marketing
department
intend
a
significant
part
of
the
speech
be
a
rant
against
system
integrator
evil
folk
who
persuade
customer
to
part
with
huge
sum
of
money
to
let
them
mess
up
perfectly
good
software
as
usual
ibm
be
single
out
as
the
bad
villain
ibm

thousand
of

who
be
eager
to
help
ibm
have
alliance
with
five
hundred

of

come

it
all
together
at

that
s
what
i

happens
what

anyway
what
do
those
thousand
of
people
do
all

unfortunately
most
of
the

just

proud
we
be

ourselves
that
we
have

a
great
first

the
other
big
take
out
from
the
paris
speech
be
ellison
s
frank
recognition
that
the
e
business
suite
didn
t
yet
do
everything
its
customer
want
and
maybe
never
would
but
that
an
to
percent
solution
that
could
be
implement
in
five
month
be
well
than
the
percent
promise
by
some
vendor
that
would
take
three
year
to
put
in
and
still
wouldn
t
work
immediately
the
chorus
go
up
that
ellison
have
claimed
that
the
suite
be
complete
and
now
he
be
say
that
it
wasn
t
the
follow
week
when

move
to
new
orleans
jarvis
persuade
ellison
to
ease
up
on
the

however
although
the
speech
go
down
much
well
than
the
one
in
paris
once
again
there
be
unintended
consequence
jarvis
say
a
whole
new
thing
come
out
which
be
that
he
give
everyone
the
impression
that
you
have
to
have
the
entire
suite
or
nothing
i
ve
look
at
the
video
many
time
he
didn
t
actually
say
that
but
that
be
the
impression
he
create
ten
day
later
on
the
first
of
march
after
the
market
have
close

cautious
they

the

earlier
forrester
have
enthuse
that

will
make

outperform
any
best
of

vendor
in
the
long
run
as
usual
chuck
phillips
brought
some
level
head
perspective
his
view
of
the
number
be
philosophical
be
this
the
begin
of
the
end
we
don
t
think
so
every
time
oracle
miss
a
quarter
which
be
about
every
five
to
seven
quarter
there
be
a
rash
of
proclamation
about
market
saturation
database
and
fatal
strategy
misstep
usually
application
that
point
to
eternal
doom
even
in
the
best
of
time
oracle
have
not
produce
smooth
license
or
product
line
growth
from
quarter
to
quarter
the
number
generally
fall
where
they
may
without
much
to
our
chagrin
a
ton
of
backlog
management
billion
of
license
revenue
get
book
in
the
last
five
day
of
the
quarter
and
it
s
difficult
to
smooth
out
that
business
model
usually
investor
throw
in
the
towel
on
oracle
for
three
quarter
and
don
t
want
to
hear
the
name
mention
for
a
while
but
then
comparison
get
easy
customer
eat
through
their
license
and
need
more
capacity
the
product
footprint
expands
into
high
growth
area
the
buying
cycle
improves
with
the
economy
and
recently
release
product
get
season
and
get
some
traction
in
the
instal
base
the
only
cure
be
time
the
mood
at
oracle
be
bloody
but
unbowed
there
be
an
embarrass
realization
that
it
have
fall
down
badly
on
execution
in
send
a
hugely
important
new
product
out
to
customer
in
an
unfit
state
but
at
the
same
time
there
be
complete
conviction
both
that
the
suite
message
be
right
and
that
oracle
be
well
on
the
way
to
deal
with
the
outstanding
quality
issue
talk
to
me
nine
month
later
ron
wohl
say
fundamentally
we
try
to
do
something
that
i
think
be
much
large
in
scope
than
even
we
realize
and
be
much
large
than
the
scope
of
any
software
we
have
release
beforehand
in
retrospect
we
didn
t
do
a
good
enough
job
up
front
our
qa
quality
assurance
procedure
didn
t
work
because
they
have
outgrown
our
scale
i
would
have
like
to
have
do
two
thing
differently
we
should
have
change
a
number
of
process
within
development
to
deal
with
the
scale
of
the
release
which
we
have
now
do
and
two
we
would
have
be
wiser
to
withhold
the
release
a
little
bit
we
would
have
be
well
off
as
a
company
if
we
have
defer
the
release
by
three
or
four
month
the
stability
actually
improve
at
a
very
rapid
pace
you
could
see
it
in
the
bug
number
you
could
see
it
in
customer
satisfaction
by
anecdote
customer
who
have
start
on
a
later
version
and
above
they
be
extremely
happy
customer
who
start
on
one
of
the
early
version
weren
t
happy
and
they
have
a
right
to
be
upset
with
us
mark
barrenechea
thanks
god
for
the
recession
we
actually
get
a
little
lucky
that
the
economy
turn
down
it
give
us
more
time
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
course
we
d
like
the
satisfaction
of
stab
our
competitor
before
they
hang
themselves
but
the
downstep
in
the
economy
meant
that
a
lot
of
them
be
just
die
it
couldn
t
have
happen
at
a
well
time
for
us
it
meant
that
there
be
few
choice
among
the
best
of
breed
vendor
and
customer
be
more
nervous
about
make
those
choice
secondly
in
a
boom
economy
there
s
a
lot
more
it
dollar
if
something
isn
t
work
the
customer
can
say
fuck
you
and
go
to
another
vendor
spend
some
more
money
so
company
weren
t
willing
to
double
down
on
their
mistake
and
bet
the
farm
they
couldn
t
abandon
us
so
they
force
oracle
and
we
be
force
ourselves
to
walk
through
the
issue
and
fix
the
problem
to
quote
john
milton
i
be
not
displeased
that
there
be
a
downturn
in
the
economy
ellison
be
rueful
but
philosophical
there
s
little
in
the
software
business
left
to
surprise
him
a
little
over
ten
year
ago
we
undertook
a
massive
rework
of
our
database
software
it
strain
our
company
to
the
limit
but
it
result
in
a
database
product
that
be
so
much
well
than
anything
offer
by
the
competition
that
we
become
the
number
one
database
company
in
the
world
we
have
to
make
big
leap
forward
in
technology
or
sink
slowly
into
obsolescence
the
pain
be
worth
the
gain
it
s
very
much
like
childbirth
it
s
a
lot
of
pain
follow
by
great
joy
the
joy
help
you
forget
the
pain
when
version
of
the
database
come
out
customer
love
it
the
pain
of
version
be
largely
forgotten
the
application
release
i
birthing
process
be
not
nearly
as
painful
as
version
of
our
database
and
i
think
the
i
gain
will
be
even
great
we
ll
see
people
haven
t
forgotten
the
pain
yet
in
fact
during
the
bad
of
our
bad
publicity
and
our
sinking
stock
price
somebody
say
to
me
oh
my
god
this
be
as
bad
as
jeff
henley
and
i
both
laugh
in
we
be
on
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
at
the
bad
point
in
this
recent
downturn
we
have
billion
in
cash
and
profit
margin
of
thirty
five
percent
ellison
have
previously
say
that
the
only
thing
that
would
make
any
difference
be
a
quarter
that
beat
expectation
most
analyst
try
to
foretell
the
future
by
understand
and
explain
the
recent
past
if
you
have
a
bad
quarter
if
your
sale
be
go
down
they
will
attribute
part
of
that
sale
decline
to
product
problem
that
be
create
competitive
pressure
if
you
suddenly
have
a
good
quarter
well
than
the
competition
they
explain
that
it
s
because
your
product
be
get
well
it
s
as
simple
as
that
they
just
look
at
the
number
so
the
best
way
to
improve
perception
of
the
e
business
suite
be
to
sell
more
of
it
then
the
analyst
will
say
good
job
oracle
it
s
a
great
product
you
get
there
despite
everything
at
least
the
idea
of
the
integrate
suite
be
begin
to
win
acceptance
not
just
from
customer
but
even
from
rival
like
sap
and
peoplesoft
george
robert
soon
begin
to
notice
that
he
no
longer
have
to
bang
the
table
with
suite
versus
kit
argument
if
you
have
a
strong
strategy
it
force
your
competition
to
respond
whether
the
release
be
premature
or
not
every
major
competitor
have
be
force
to
respond
to
the
oracle
message
and
the
value
proposition
that
we
brought
out
with
i
the
initial
execution
might
have
left
much
to
be
desire
but
oracle
be
a
company
that
learns
from
its
mistake
oracle
and
ellison
in
particular
have
a
reputation
for
arrogance
but
during
the
difficult
first
six
month
of
i
discover
an
impressive
determination
to
face
fact
and
put
thing
right
combine
with
an
iron
conviction
that
the
e
business
suite
be
still
destine
for
greatness
establish
it
would
not
be
the
early
round
knockout
that
ellison
have
predict
but
as
the
go
get
tough
his
certainty
of
ultimate
victory
if
anything
seem
to
increase

we
be
get
a
lot
of
pressure
from
our
customer
to
deliver
the

i
make
a

of
them
mad
by
delay
the

for
several

i
should
have
delayed
it

le
writes
the
big
lesson
i
learn
from
the
release
of
i
be
to
make
sure
we
use
the
application
internally
before
we
give
them
to
customer
that
s
how
we
operate
today
and
it
s
make
all
the
difference
once
we
re
use
an
application
successfully
at

it

much
less
likely
that

impression
about

that
may
be
damage
its
prospect
in
the
market
and
for
which
he
feel
largely
responsible
ellison
have
already
acknowledge
that
he
make
a
mistake
in
sound
too
hostile
to
system
integration
some
integration
with
legacy
software
be
inevitable
in
all
but
the
new
business
it
s
modify
code
that
s
the
real
crime
but
there
s
another
misapprehension
that
he
think
could
be
hold
back
sale
by
spending
so
much
time
and
money
extol
the
benefit

uniqueness
of

as
both
integrate
and
complete

may
have
frighten
off
potential
customer
by
make
them
think
that
they
have
to
buy
and
install
the
whole
suite
at
once
a
massive
undertaking
that
implies
get
rid
of
any
exist
software
no
matter
how
recently
acquire
and
fit
for
the
job
the
new
line
be
that
the
e
business
suite
can
be
broken
down
into
bite
size
chunk
that
automate
discrete
business
flow
the
idea
be
that
you
can
decide
which
flow
of
business
process
you
want
to
automate
first
get
that
do
quickly
and
relatively
cheaply
and
then
move
on
to
automate
others
when
the
first
have
proven
its
worth
to
dramatize
the
idea
and
to
differentiate
oracle
s
offering
from
that
of
its
deadly
rival
siebel
ellison
have
come
up
with

forbes
ellison
start
off
by
say
that
the
software
industry
s
preoccupation
with
offering
separate
application
for
what
be
really
continuous
process
have
make
the
graceful
flow
of
information
hard
to
achieve
for

say
ellison
although
siebel
provide

automation
it
doesn
t
have
contract
automation
by

the

business
suite
automates
complete
business
flow
that
reflect
the
way
business
operate
in
the
real
world
the
alternative
be
to
automate
functional
department
in
separate
module
but
unless
data
be
to
stay
fragment
among
different
application
you
need
to
write
separate
program
that
attempt
to
move
the
data
between
each
application
it
s
an
approach
that
as
ellison
never
tire
of

meaning
one
group
can
t
work
with
another
even
when
it
doesn

fail
it
s
still

expensive

it

clear
that
they

it
more

ellison

answer
be
that
the
cost
have
never
be
in
the

but
in
the
labor
need
to
put

the

guy
get

they

also
pretty
use
to
hearing
ellison
banging
on
about

s
war
on

and
the
dreadful
consequence
of

even
though
he
s
always
funny
and
they
can
t
help
laugh
at
his
joke
what
they
most
want
be
to
get
ellison
talk
about
the
economy
and
its
effect
on
the

landscape

of

among

a
proposal
that

s
e
mail

which
ellison
say
be
faster
and
more
reliable
than
microsoft

because
it
run
on

of

no
sense
to
price
every

that
s
the
way
the
enterprise
software
business
have
be
for
a
very
very
long
time
another
mystery
to
ellison
be
the
poor

like
what
he
hears
always
suspicious
about
the
ability
of
sale
organization
to
extract
more
than
they
should
by
counting
the

by

he

the

there

he
asks

just
what
be
it
that
we
re
announce
tomorrow
the
tension
in
the
room
be
mount
be
ellison
go
to
pull
tomorrow
s
announcement
one
of
the
team
involve
in
the
crm
in
ninety
day
initiative
be
lick
his
lip
nervously
and
start
to
sweat
despite
the
air
conditioning
he
agrees
that
the
product
isn
t
ready
ellison
say
with
rise
incredulity
you
want
to
announce
this
but
not
deliver
until
may
can
anyone
tell
me
why
we
re
do
this
why
should
we
announce
it
now
why
shouldn
t
we
wait
until
it
work
it
s
a
nasty
moment
but
ellison
be
assure
that
the
other
flow
be
ready
the
decision
be
make
to
pull
the
sale
force
compensation
package
until
the
problem
be
resolve
and
go
ahead
with
launch
the
other
flow
on
tuesday

when
the
day
be
over
ellison
and
i
drive
the
half
mile
to
a
canalside
house
he
own
in
redwood
shore
where
we
can
sit
on
the
deck
and
watch
the
pelican
ellison
s
earlier
belief
sincerely
held
that
oracle
alone
might
miraculously
escape
the
recession
sweep
through
the
rest
of
the
technology
industry
now
seem
ludicrously
optimistic
what
really
happen
during
those
last
few
day
in
february
at
the
end
of
the
quarter
be
it
a
question
of
two
or
three
big
deal
fall
through
at
the
last
moment
as
ellison
have
earlier
appear
to
suggest
or
be
something
more
fundamental
go
on
no
it
be
a
lot
of
deal
dozen
i
d
say
sometimes
a
deal
be
delayed
sometimes
the
size
of
the
deal
drop
from
million
to
million
all
of
a
sudden
people
stop
buying
in
anticipation
of
their
need
for
the
next
couple
of
year
instead
they
bought
exactly
what
they
need
for
the
next
three
month
there
be
even
case
where
company
that
be
already
use
our
software
be
try
to
find
way
not
to
pay
for
it
i
m
not
go
to
mention
name
but
a
very
large
wireless
company
that
be
suppose
to
give
us
million
or
million
this
quarter
base
on
their
own
publish
subscriber
number
decide
to
dispute
the
amount
it
be
just
a
negotiate
tactic
if
we
lower
their
bill
they
d
pay
us
this
quarter
we
didn
t
lot
of
tech
company
and
telco
be
under
financial
stress
so
they
re
be
much
more
careful
with
their
cash
these
day
the
dot
com
die
out
be
get
bad
suddenly
move
all
your
business
process
to
the
internet
doesn
t
seem
so
important
anymore
it
seem
like
e
business
and
the
internet
be
go
out
of
fashion
i
suggest
that
perhaps
company
be
no
longer
worried
about
web
base
stealth
competitor
come
from
nowhere
to
eat
their
lunch
that
s
exactly
right
say
ellison
wal
mart
be
no
longer
worried
about
amazon
com
if
wal
mart
ever
be
worried
about
amazon
a
lot
of
company
have
realize
they
don
t
have
to
move
quite
so
quickly
they
can
be
more
deliberate
and
automate
at
a
more
rational
rate
fly
the
internet
flag
isn
t
so
cool
anymore
perhaps
another
factor
be
that
simply
make
an
announcement
about
what
you
be
do
on
the
internet
be
no
longer
likely
to
have
a
major
impact
on
their
stock
price
absolutely
reply
ellison
all
these
b
b
exchange
there
be
lot
of
company
that
issue
a
press
release
about
a
b
b
exchange
and
saw
their
stock
price
shoot
up
commerce
one
dish
out
about
three
of
these
b
b
press
release
for
every
one
that
we
sent
out
they
kill
us
in
the
press
release
war
but
that
exchange
business
be
go
now
and
it
s
not
just
the
exchange
business
that
s
dry
up
company
be
much
more
cautious
about
buying
any
kind
of
new
technology
it
be
almost
as
if
ellison
be
talk
about
some
semi
mythical
period
remember
only
through
the
mist
of
time
i
can
t
help
remind
him
that
in
mid
february
only
ten
week
ago
he
still
thought
oracle
would
make
its
number
absolutely
he
say
we
go
into
that
quarter
extremely
confident
we
get
off
to
a
great
start
if
you
look
at
our
quarter
month
by
month
we
have
great
growth
in
december
we
be
still
way
ahead
in
january
and
then
we
hit
the
wall
in
february
when
do
he
first
know
that
something
big
have
change
and
why
didn
t
oracle
s
own
much
vaunt
e
business
system
provide
any
warn
our
sale
forecasting
system
tell
us
how
many
deal
be
in
the
pipeline
and
multiplies
their
value
by
a
historic
close
rate
if
there
s
a
change
in
close
rate
we
detect
that
but
in
our
case
we
don
t
detect
it
until
the
last
day
or
two
of
the
quarter
because
that
s
when
we
close
so
much
of
our
business
i
hate
that
consult
firm
actually
go
out
and
train
software
buyer
to
negotiate
right
up
until
the
last
hour
of
the
last
day
of
our
quarter
before
signing
a
multimillion
dollar
deal
most
software
company
will
increase
the
discount
on
the
last
day
just
to
get
the
deal
into
the
quarter
it
s
a
monster
the
industry
have
create
by
mapping
its
sale
compensation
plan
to
its
fiscal
reporting
i
think
that
s
a
bad
practice
and
we
ve
try
to
put
a
stop
to
it
at
oracle
but
that
hasn
t
stop
our
big
customer
from
ask
and
take
us
right
up
to
the
end
of
quarter
before
they
sign
i
ask
ellison
what
he
have
expect
the
reaction
to
be
when
he
issue
the
earnings
warn
he
say
well
the
reaction
have
already
occur
the
stock
have
already
go
down
dramatically
it
be
one
very
loud
i
told
you
so
it
turn
out
that
the
analyst
be
look
at
the
macroeconomic
forecast
and
that
prove
to
be
more
accurate
than
our
internal
system
sale
forecast
so
how
bad
do
he
think
thing
be
go
to
get
and
how
do
he
plan
to
adjust
to
the
new
circumstance
well
first
off
i
thank
god
that
we
spent
the
last
two
year
reengineering
our
company
into
an
efficient
global
e
business
if
we
have
just
start
the
process
of
move
to
the
internet
now
we
would
really
be
in
trouble
yeah
we
be
disappointed
in
the
quarter
but
it
wasn
t
a
disaster
our
sale
go
up
our
margin
go
up
and
our
profit
go
up
i
m
not
happy
but
i
m
not
go
to
go
out
and
kill
myself
we
re
really
in
pretty
good
shape
we
re
make
a
lot
of
money
and
our
product
have
never
be
strong
we
have
release
i
of
the
database
come
out
soon
we
have
a
cool
new
version
of
the
application
server
that
s
go
to
drive
bea
nut
our
product
be
competitive
and
our
organization
be
efficient
those
two
thing
allow
me
to
sleep
at
night
the
last
time
the
economy
slow
down
in
oracle
lose
money
even
if
the
product
cycle
be
in
good
shape
it
be
clear
from
the
crm
in
ninety
day
initiative
that
the
marketing
message
be
change
with
the
time
that
s
true
without
the
same
sense
of
urgency
about
move
to
the
internet
we
have
to
sell
differently
what
we
re
sell
now
be
very
rapid
low
cost
low
risk
implementation
of
automate
business
flow
the
e
business
suite
contains
several
separate
business
flow
we
can
automate
one
flow
at
a
time
like
procure
to
pay
or
opportunity
to
global
sale
forecast
and
so
on
we
provide
the
software
and
the
labor
to
get
it
up
and
run
for
a
guaranteed
fix
price
so
customer
get
a
guaranteed
return
on
their
investment
with
a
minimum
of
risk
that
s
what
s
sell
these
day
return
on
investment
people
have
lose
their
appetite
for
risk
sell
separate
flow
solve
another
key
problem
for
us
by
talk
about
the
e
business
suite
as
complete
people
thought
that
you
have
to
buy
and
install
the
entire
suite
all
at
once
it
s
an
all
or
nothing
kind
of
deal
no
no
no
not
true
but
our
competitor
use
it
against
us
quite
effectively
so
we
thought
that
we
have
well
start
talk
about
the
separate
e
business
suite
flow
inside
the
suite
that
also
let
us
sell
well
against
the
best
of
breed
specialist
we
ll
sign
a
contract
guarantee
to
do
a
crm
flow
in
ninety
day
for
x
number
of
dollar
we
tell
our
prospect
to
go
ask
ibm
and
siebel
how
long
it
will
take
and
how
much
it
will
cost
for
them
to
do
the
same
thing
it
be
the
best
way
we
could
think
of
to
drive
home
the
point
that
oracle
application
install
faster
and
be
much
less
expensive
to
run
than
the
competition
even
today
many
company
make
the
incredibly
expensive
mistake
of
fail
to
ask
for
a
guaranteed
implementation
cost
and
guaranteed
annual
operating
cost
of
the
application
system
they
be
about
to
buy
we
ll
guarantee
everything
the
competition
won
t
would
oracle
have
go
down
this
route
if
the
economy
hadn
t
go
bad
well
marketing
the
flow
separately
be
a
good
idea
with
or
without
the
downturn
we
market
the
complete
integrate
e
business
suite
as
a
cost
cut
productivity
enhance
engine
now
we
emphasize
the
fact
that
you
can
install
the
suite
a
flow
at
a
time
so
we
have
two
application
marketing
message
the
first
message
be
we
have
a
complete
integrate
e
business
suite
we
save
billion
at
oracle
use
it
the
second
message
be
that
you
can
install
one
business
flow
at
a
time
quickly
and
at
a
guaranteed
price
a
big
part
of
ellison
s
i
campaign
have
be
center
on
the
idea
that
system
integration
be
to
be
avoid
at
all
cost
yet
the
assumption
behind
be
able
to
install
the
software
to
manage
a
particular
flow
be
that
it
be
be
integrate
at
some
point
with
legacy
system
didn
t
that
mean
that
he
be
backtracking
on
something
pretty
fundamental
yeah
the
just
say
no
to
system
integration
slogan
be
poorly
thought
out
on
my
part
it
wasn
t
system
integration
that
have
to
be
avoid
it
be
code
modify
that
have
to
be
avoid
of
course
some
system
integration
may
be
necessary
so
wake
up
try
a
little
harder
perhaps
another
reason
for
the
flip
flop
on
system
integration
could
be
the
damage
that
be
be
do
to
oracle
s
relation
with
the
big
consult
firm
which
frequently
recommend
what
software
their
client
should
buy
ellison
say
i
don
t
think
so
we
still
think
it
s
important
to
minimize
system
integration
it
s
just
not
always
possible
to
eliminate
it
completely
say
no
to
system
integration
be
right
some
of
the
time
but
it
wasn
t
right
often
enough
for
it
to
be
our
primary
message
no
code
modification
be
the
correct
message
if
you
ve
integrate
our
accounting
application
to
your
custom
telephone
billing
system
you
can
easily
move
to
the
next
version
of
our
accounting
system
so
long
as
you
haven
t
modify
our
code
if
you
ve
modify
our
code
you
re
stuck
and
the
integrator
the
consultant
now
that
we
ve
clean
up
our
message
the
integrator
that
compete
on
price
love
us
because
we
install
faster
and
cost
less
to
operate
than
the
competition
the
integrator
that
do
the
giant
time
and
material
project
still
don
t
like
our
message
how
be
oracle
do
in
effort
to
win
a
massive
deal
with
at
t
that
ellison
have
recently
be
pitch
in
new
york
they
ll
make
a
choice
in
very
very
short
order
i
think
we
re
ahead
we
re
the
only
one
that
can
do
the
business
flow
by
the
way
we
do
a
very
similar
business
flow
for
their
adsl
division
the
business
we

catch

the
fight
against
siebel
the
market
leader
in
sale
automation
and
crm
software
go
on
other
front
what
about
tom
siebel
s
remark
quote
earlier
in
the
day
that
he
hardly
ever
saw
oracle
compete
with
crm
on
major
account
it
s
the
kind
of
dismissive
claim
that
incumbent
always
like
to
make
about
the
pretension
of
challenger
but
it
have
seem
to
needle
ellison
obviously
mark
barrenechea
live
and
breathe
the
idea
of
one
day
destroy
siebel
as
a
serious
rival
but
what
about
ellison
do
he
get
up
in
the
morning
think
about
how
to
take
the
fight
to
siebel
ellison
reply
at
one
point
i
ranked
siebel
as
our
most
important
application
competitor
because
they
re
the
large
best
of
breed
software
company
and
they
have
a
close
partnership
with
the
large
best
of
breed
integrator
ibm
i
thought
we
have
to
beat
siebel
for
the
suite
approach
to
triumph
over
best
of
breed
but
even
now
the
outcome
of
that
war
be
now
fairly
certain
we
ll
end
up
with
a
couple
of
suite
company
and
sap
will
be
our
only
major
competitor
it
s
true
that
the
tech
downturn
isn
t
all
bad
news
for
oracle
the
like
of
the
once
fashionable
ariba
and
commerce
one
which
have
be
carry
to
extraordinary
market
cap
by
the
internet
tsunami
be
now
in
danger
of
be
left
high
and
dry
but
siebel
system
be
a
much
tougher
proposition
found
and
run
with
iron
discipline
by
the
former
oracle
salesman
tom
siebel
the
company
be
still
outsell
oracle
in
crm
by
a
factor
of
four
to
one
revenue
in
broke
the
billion
mark
accompany
by
net
earnings
of
million
siebel
also
have
a
war
chest
of
well
over
billion
useful
rainy
day
money
to
ride
out
a
prolong
tech
slump
i
first
met
siebel
in
the
summer
of
at
his
office
which
cheekily
stand
just
three
mile
north
of
oracle
s
on
the
opposite
side
of
highway
a
small
intense
man
with
a
harsh
gravelly
voice
he
lose
little
time
in
launch
a
bitter
attack
on
ellison
and
what
he
call
his
pathological
lie
when
he
heard
i
be
have
lunch
with
ellison
later
that
day
he
immediately
scrawl
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
six
lie
of
larry
ellison
and
say
give
him
that
which
to
ellison
s
vast
amusement
i
do
siebel
s
main
point
about
oracle
be
that
however
much
it
be
prepared
to
throw
at
building
a
competitive
crm
package
he
would
believe
it
when
he
saw
it
this
isn
t
simply
something
you
can
throw
a
thousand
software
programmer
at
it
s
something
that
somebody
in
the
organization
have
to
know
something
about
in
much
the
same
way
that
ellison
us
microsoft
and
ibm
as
the
point
to
oracle
s
counterpoint
siebel
us
ellison
and
oracle
to
define
what
siebel
isn
t
he
say
it
be
critically
important
to
me
that
siebel
system
never
develops
yet
another
pathological
a
favorite
siebel
word
silicon
valley
corporate
culture
too
many
company
here
have
an
arrogant
self
image
their
attitude
be
we
be
genius
and
visionary
who
make
insanely
great
technology
and
there
s
the
cult
of
the
software
ceo
where
it
s
all
about
me
me
me
and
my
transitory
fulfillment
my
parking
lot
fill
with
ferraris
my
crush
the

my
money
article
with
picture
of
me
in
my
fighter
jet
or
be
escort
around
by
pr
assistant
who
could
he
be
talk
about
although
ellison
patronizingly
refers
to
him
as
tommy
he
have
a
grudge
admiration
for
what
siebel
have
achieve
in
define
and
dominate
a
market
much
as
oracle
do
in
its
early
day
but
he
doesn
t
have
much
respect
for
siebel
s
technology
siebel
system
be
all
about
sale
automation
they
define
the
category
and
make
the
market
they
be
the
first
mover
they
built
a
ruthless
big
deal
focus
sale
force
but
they
have
a
couple
of
problem
despite
what
tom
say
their
software
s
still
client
server
and
their
internet
version
isn
t
due
out
until
the
fall
two
year
ago
the
siebel
web
site
claimed
their
software
be
architected
for
the
internet
but
it
wasn
t
now
they
say
that
their
internet
version
be
on
its
way
so
i
guess
they
move
to
the
internet
two
year
ago
and
it
be
so
much
fun
they
re
go
to
do
it
again
so
who
s
lie
tom
and
craig
conway
be
both
key
lieutenant
in
gary
kennedy
s
sale
team
be
they
hard
charger
jesus
be
they
ever
they
re
both
killer
salesman
and
hard
drive
sale
manager
that
s
what
make
them
successful
but
they
re
not
choirboy
and
now
that
they
re
both
ceo
they
ll
live
and
die
as
their
quarterly
result
rise
and
fall
tommy
talk
a
lot
about
the
pathology
of
oracle
and
when
tommy
talk
people
listen
because
he
be
deliver
the
good
quarter
after
quarter
but
that
s
all
about
to
end
he
really
struggle
to
make
his
last
quarter
he
pumped
it
up
with
software
swap
and
a
big
deal
with
ibm
he
can
t
do
that
two
quarter
in
a
row
tommy
s
go
to
crash
siebel
be
indeed
find
the
go
harder
but
ellison
s
prediction
about
siebel
hit
a
wall
have
be
wrong
before
two
year
earlier
he
have
forecast
that
by
the
middle
of
oracle
would
have
knock
siebel
off
its
perch
part
of
oracle
s
problem
be
that
it
have
take
the
company
so
long
to
build
a
product
with
enough
feature
to
match
siebel
s
even
remotely
and
whereas
siebel
have
go
out
and
bought
company
to
fill
feature
gap
ellison
have
insist
on
make
everything
at
home
to
ensure
the
architectural
integrity
of
the
integrate
suite
as
usual
ellison
put
a
high
priority
on
the
benefit
that
derive
from
engineering
elegance
than
the
crude
business
functionality
that
siebel
s
hotshot
sale
force
expertly
leveraged
with
customer
however
a
new
report
from
the
gartner
group
have
found
that
while
siebel
remain
well
ahead
in
term
of
customer
win
in
the
last
year
oracle
have
emerge
as
its
only
significant
challenger
put
distance
between
itself
and
the
rest
of
the
chase
pack
ellison
say
we
don
t
have
every
feature
that
siebel
have
with
all
their
different
crm
product
but
our
crm
front
office
system
be
tightly
integrate
with
our
erp
back
office
system
our
crm
system
and
erp
system
share
a
common
database
so
it
s
easy
to
find
the
information
you
re
look
for
all
our
application
be
architected
for
the
internet
so
it
s
quick
and
easy
to
roll
them
out
globally
we
have
enough
advantage
to
win
our
fair
share
of
crm
deal
siebel
built
their
feature
rich
portfolio
of
crm
product
by
acquire
lot
of
different
crm
company
scopus
and
about
a
dozen
others
then
they
rebranded
all
these
separate
product
as
the
siebel
crm
suite
but
it
s
not
a
true
suite
the
product
be
barely
integrate
and
they
don
t
share
a
common
database
write
check
be
easy
write
software
be
hard
could
we
have
caught
up
with
siebel
any
faster
sure
all
we
have
to
do
be
buy
a
bunch
of
company
like
they
do
but
we
want
to
stick
to
our
product
strategy
of
an
integrate
suite
built
on
top
of
a
common
database
the
only
way
to
get
one
of
those
be
to
build
it
from
scratch
you
can
t
go
out
and
buy
it
because
it
doesn
t
exist
we
re
building
software
about
as
fast
as
we
can
we
have
nearly
four
thousand
application
developer
work
on
the
suite
about
nine
hundred
of
them
in
crm
accord
to
mark
barrenechea
the
true
crm
figure
be
nearer
to
fifteen
hundred
up
from
ten
when
he
arrive
at
oracle
four
year
ago
ellison
still
doesn
t
know
how
many
people
work
for
him
they
may
have
built
the
empire
state
building
in
nine
month
but
the
e
business
suite
have
already
take
us
several
year
and
we
re
still
not
do
complex
business
software
take
a
long
long
time
to
build
sometimes
you
have
to
build
it
two
or
three
time
before
you
get
it
right
mark
barrenechea
still
have
a
lot
of
work
left
to
do
mark
work
for
scopus
when
siebel
bought
them
but
come
to
work
at
oracle
rather
than
go
to
siebel
something
to
do
with
have
to
wear
a
tie
while
program
tom
siebel
insists
on
suit
and
tie
as
a
mark
of
respect
to
customer
and
as
another
way
to
differentiate
the
company
from
the
silicon
valley
norm
as
barrenechea
tell
it
i
remember
go
over
to
larry
s
house
in
atherton
this
be
my
first
experience
of
larry
he
show
up
in
short
and
a
pink
tank
top
hold
a
glass
of
carrot
juice
and
i
m
think
this
be
my
kind
of
guy
i
ask
ellison
if
he
see
siebel
in
the
same
category
as
niche
player
like
the
internet
procurement
specialist
ariba
and
commerce
one
yes
siebel
be
a
best
of
breed
specialty
player
he
say
i
d
put
siebel
and
i
into
the
same
category
why
their
stuff
be
too
expensive
to
install
integrate
and
operate
i
d
guess
that
more
than
half
the
software
these
guy
sell
sits
on
the
shelf
and
never
get
use
shelfware
company
still
buy
from
siebel
because
they
re
the
crm
leader
and
people
think
it
s
safe
to
go
with
the
leader
but
i
be
the
supply
chain
leader
and
look
what
s
happen
to
them
oracle
and
sap
be
rapidly
get
i
out
of
our
epr
account
we
ll
get
siebel
out
too
every
year
siebel
and
i
will
come
under
more
and
more
pressure
i
don
t
see
how
they
can
survive
the
idea
of
speed
up
that
market
consolidation
through
acquisition
doesn
t
much
appeal
to
ellison
even
though
the
batter
and
reel
niche
player
would
now
go
for
peanut
one
possible
exception
be
clarify
the
call
center
specialist

nortel
a

of

we

probably
we
ve
never

more
than

well
at

we
be
at

about

we
can

that
ellison
wish
he
have
do
be
to
buy

in
when
its

on
the

high

we
could

for

three

i
want
to
do
it
at

i
gradually

just
too
risky
we
be
in
the

of
a
massive
reengineering
of
our

pretty
risky
to
me

something
else
bother
me
even
more
peoplesoft
pretend
to
be

they

you

the

of

gradually

peoplesoft
be

damn
cheap
we
probably
should
have
bought
them
anyway
it
be
close
but
we
probably
make
the
wrong
call
they
certainly
do
although
in
a
predictable
echo
of
tom
siebel
s
remark
about
oracle
ellison
say
that
he
never
see
peoplesoft
compete

there
s
evidence
in
both
the

in

they
own
it
second

pretty
well

along

our

to

until

he

confident

it
s
a
variation
on

from
his

turn

into
an
e
business
and
why
it
s
a
process
in
which

must
become

the
profound
impact
of
the
internet
the
failure
of

to
deliver
on

promise
because
it
be
an
industry
found
on
a
model
that
both
celebrates
and
distributes
complexity
and
finally
the
extraordinary
benefit
to
be
have
in
term
of
efficiency
and
know
what
s
go
on
in
your
business
by
adopt
oracle
s
approach
of
implement
a
fully
integrate
suite
of
application
on
top
of
a
single
consolidated
database
but
the
anecdote
of
the
chaos
at
oracle
before
he
saw
the
light
be
well
hone
and
funny
what
s
more
they
strike
an
immediate
chord
with
his
guest
as
he
know
they
will
the
confessional
tone
be
calculate
to
get
others
to
tell
blood
curdling
horror
story
of
their
own
and
then
for
ellison
to
point
them
in
the
direction
of
salvation
there
be
however
a
potential
danger
in

funny
about
the
nightmare
that
the
it
industry
have
visit
on
its
wretched
customer
in
his
own
imagination
ellison
have
long
since
move
on
to
a
simpler
and
more
rational
kind
of
compute
that
banish

that
s
right
guaranteed
to
provide
a
spectacular
and
speedy

on

however
even
at

with
its

trumpet

of
saving
and
the
boast
of
be
able
to
extract

this

moderate
because

ellison

his
own
cfo
jeff

slightly
ahead
of

but
for

some
of
the
one
around

on

what
might
be
gall
be
the
fact
that
until
very
recently
oracle
have
enthusiastically
be
sell
the
very
approach
namely
customize
best
of

solution
that
ellison
be
now
describe
as
madness
by
the
time
ellison
stop
speak
after
a
good
forty
five
minute
one
of
the
guest
george

we

i
feel

we

down
the
primrose
path
by
the
it
guy
it
be
always
jam
tomorrow
we
have
all
the
best

in
the

peoplesoft
i
oracle
it
s
a
real
hodgepodge
of
system
ellison
have
a
there
you
be
kind
of
smirk
on
his
face
he
say
that
s
the
absolute
archetype
of
what
not
to
do
buckley
look
furiously
across
the
table
at
him
well
i
ve
get
to
tell
you
that
it
be
oracle
consultant
who
when
press
by
my
it
people
on
a
perceive
deficiency
in
your

would
say
that
maybe
peoplesoft
or
i
might
be
well
well
i
m
not
go

it
now
idt
s
jim
courter
chip
in
say
we
be
fed
all
kind
of
promise
that
it
will
all
work
and
it
doesn
t
buckley
add
we
re
in
so
deep
now
that
spending
money
be
not
the
way
we
re
spending
million
a
year
now
so
how
do
we
get
out
of
this
mess
it
will
be
interest
to
see
how
ellison
get
out
of
the
hole
he
s
dug
for
himself
what
he
d
like
to
do
be
disown
the
advice
that
oracle
s
own
consultant
be
peddle
only
a
couple
of
year
previously
when
oracle
have
some
major
gap
in
its
application
suite
and
couldn
t
afford
to
be
so
dismissive
about
best
of
breed
if
it
be
to
compete
with
the
more
complete
product
from
sap
but
with
sandy
sanderson
who
have
run
consult
since
the
departure
of
robert
shaw
in
a
few
foot
away
from
him
do
so
might
be
embarrass
instead
he
tell
buckley
that
he
should
actually
be
cut
his
it
budget
he
suggests
that
buckley
stop
the
work
on
some
of
his
exist
system
integration
project
and
swap
a
portion
of
the
budget
out
to
install
i
in
one
part
of
the
business
once
it
have
prove
itself
buckley
can
start
roll
it
out
across
the
rest
of
his
company
by
fire
some
of
the
consultant
wrestling
with
his
exist
software
and
start
again
buckley
will
be
able
to
save
some
of
the
money
he
s
currently
spending
say
ellison
slightly
smugly
si
be
the
gift
that
keep
on
give
buckley
doesn
t
look
any
happier
the
expression
on
his
face
suggests
that
ellison
be
the
bad
kind
of
snake
oil
salesman
it
turn
out
however
that
one
of
his
firm
s
division
be
in
the
process
of
do
a
percent
i
implementation
ellison
suggests
that
they
audit
how
it
go
and
the
time
it
take
to
get
a
return
from
the
software
sandy
sanderson
will
follow
up
and
report
back
if
that
work
maybe
buckley
will
be
more
inclined
to
take
up
ellison
s
suggestion
of
divert
fund
from
other
project
the
message
that
ellison
want
to
emphasize
be
that
his
guest
should
spend
less
on
their
it
rather
than
more
by
stall
some
spending
and
take
his
recommend
path
of
put
in
i
without
modification
he
genuinely
believe
that
they
will
save
money
the
key
he
say
be
speed
most
sap
failure
happen
because
the
project
never
get
finish
the
money
spent
go
to
ibm
and
andersen
don
t
take
a
three
year
flyer
like
that
the
longer
a
project
run
the
less
likely
it
will
be
to
finish
freeze
your
budget
and
we
ll
get
you
a
return
in
very
short
order
it
s
the
rule
a
project
aim
for
percent
of
the
benefit
will
never
finish
but
if
you
go
for
percent
you
can
get
it
do
in
six
to
nine
month
david
lawrence
of

who
have
the

there

ellison

it

just
the
opening
ellison
need
to
describe
the
approach
he
use
at
oracle
what
he
call
spending
less
to
know
more
the
pitch
have
now
be
carefully
hone
to
the
new
reality
of
shrink
it
budget
disenchantment
with
the
internet
and
the
absolute
requirement
for
rapid
payback
when
we
first
start
planning
the
replacement
of
all
our
local
country
system
there
be
hundred
of
them
with
a
single
global
e
business
system
the
planning
team
told
me
i
need
to
increase
our
it
budget
by
million
and
not
to
expect
to
see
any
payback
for
at
least
three
year
sound
familiar
of
course
our
it
budget
be
already
way
too
high
it
need
to
go
down
not
up
we
have
to
find
a
way
to
fund
our
global
e
business
transformation
out
of
our
exist
it
budget
so
i
review
every
one
of
our
internal
it
project
if
a
project
wasn
t
go
to
pay
for
itself
in
twelve
month
we
kill
it
that
didn
t
mean
we
cancel
every
big
project
it
just
meant
we
have
to
break
up
our
big
project
into
multiple
step
and
make
sure
we
be
get
deliverable
with
benefit
and
cost
saving
at
every
stage
along
the
way
if
we
couldn
t
break
a
big
project
into
step
then
we
kill
it
every
time
we
kill
something
of
questionable
value
we
freed
up
people
and
budget
to
work
on
the
global
e
business
project
and
a
couple
of
other
cool
new
thing
i
have
in
mind
now
we
target
two
operational
system
that
be
burning
money
like
it
be
go
out
of
style
we
have
so
many
e
mail
system
and
window
file
server
that
we
couldn
t
figure
out
how
much
we
be
actually
spending
on
them
but
we
knew
it
be
a
lot
replace
our
ninety
seven
local
country
e
mail
system
with
one
global
e
mail
system
save
a
fortune
replace
our
two
thousand
window
file
server
with
one
global
file
share
system
save
even
more
than
global
e
mail
these
two
project
be
the
closest
you
get
in
my
business
to
cheap
thrill
both
project
be
quick
and
easy
to
do
and
have
huge
near
term
payoff
everyone
should
do
them
it
only
take
about
ninety
day
to
low
your
e
mail
and
file
share
cost
by
to
percent
we
actually
end
up
save
more
than
the
million
we
need
to
build
our
global
e
business
system
by
the
time
we
finish
put
in
our
global
e
mail
and
file
share
system
and
consolidate
our
data
center
our
it
budget
have
drop
by
half
as
predict
our
global
e
business
system
do
take
about
three
year
to
put
in
but
we
save
money
every
step
of
the
way
every
time
we
fold
another
local
country
s
system
into
our
global
system
our
it
cost
go
down
and
the
quality
of
our
business
process
and
information
go
up
the
first
local
system
we
turn
off
be
in
latin
america
separate
off
a
small
part
of
your
business
a
country
or
a
division
and
move
that
small
organization
to
the
e
business
suite
first
the
start
small
approach
minimizes
both
risk
and
cost
you
ll
find
out
very
quickly
if
the
suite
delivers
value
to
your
business
if
it
do
then
you
can
start
add
other
country
or
division
into
your
work
e
business
suite
system
we
start
in
latin
america
because
they
be
the
least
automate
part
of
our
business
and
they
be
the
most
willing
to
move
to
our
new
standardize
internet
business
process
after
we
get
latin
america
run
smoothly
we
start
move
other
country
into
the
global
system
in
our
big
country
like
the
u
s
and
japan
there
be
a
lot
of
resistance
to
the
change
but
it
have
very
little
to
do
with
our
e
business
software
people
didn
t
want
to
adopt
our
new
global
business
process
because
it
meant
they
d
have
to
change
the
way
they
work
the
resistance
be
fierce
but
we
finally
broke
through
by
make
the
people
write
down
exactly
why
they
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
change
to
our
new
business
process
make
them
write
it
down
force
people
to
carefully
study
and
think
through
the
new
process
most
of
the
time
that
result
in
them
realize
that
the
new
process
be
okay
percent
of
the
case
but
sometimes
they
found
real
deficiency
in
the
software
and
they
write
down
exactly
what
the
engineer
need
to
do
to
fix
it
which
they
do
once

country
after
country

the
global
system
in
rapid
succession
every
time
we
add
another
country
to
the
global
system
our
information
get
well
and
our

down

you
can
get

however
within

the

be
more
than
just
a

the

welch

now
bos

insist
that

meant
that
a
traditional
approach
to

integration
wouldn
t
work
particularly
as
the
other
outfit
in

that

in

have
a
mishmash
of

system
from
different

at
a
strategic
level
ge
be
already
convince
that
go
down
the
integrate
suite
route
make
more
sense
than
best
of
breed
and
anyway
time
wouldn
t
allow
for
anything
else
nor
be
there
much
doubt
that
oracle
would
get
the
nod
release
have
already
be
instal
elsewhere
in
ge
for
example
in
medical
system
and
be
do
all
right
in
july
a
month
after
the
bulldozer
start
clearing
earth
at
veresegyh
z
the
big
discussion
be
whether
to
take
the
chance
of
go
with
i
only
week
after
its
release
kipp
asks
do
we
really
want
to
take
the
risk
put
up
a
new
plant
in
central
europe
and
have
to
hire
a
workforce
from
scratch
be
risky
enough
in
the
end
what
swung
it
be
the
superior
upgrade
path
because
it
be
all
internet
oracle
convince
us
that
we
could
seamlessly
get
new
version
and
new
feature
as
they
become
available
the
attitude
here
be
that
everything
s
go
to
the
internet
so
we
just
decide
on
make
a
leap
of
faith
the
whole
thing
have
to
be
instal
in
just
a
few
month
and
we
kind
of
figure
that
oracle
couldn
t
afford
to
let
us
down
it
be
a
shrewd
calculation
the
contract
be
sign
in
late
october
with
a
clear
understand
that
if
oracle
deliver
at
veresegyh
z
ge
would
start
roll
out
i
across
its
thirty
or
so
other
turbine
plant
within
a
month
the
project
be
in
trouble
kipp
be
use
a

it
consult
firm
name
ejiva
which
have
do
work
for
ge
in
hungary
before
but
be
now
struggle
worried
kipp
told
nardelli
that
at
this
rate
he
would
never
hit
his
milestone
nardelli
and
rice
decide
to
call
larry
ellison
kipp
say
within
a
week
we
have
thirty
to
forty
oracle
consultant
it
be
like
a
mash
unit
arrive
kipp
be
work
from
hastily
convert
office
on
a
run
down
industrial
estate
that
he
christen
the

there
be
lot
of
thing
go
on
hire
people
rid
the
builder
work
with
local
government
until
december
i
thought
thing
be
under
control
on
the
other
side
of
town
we
have
all
these
people
from
ge
and
oracle
there
be
about
eighty
of
them
in
an
office
design
for
forty
they
be
work
through
the
night
mapping
process
and
figure
out
what
they
want
the
software
to
do
when
the
consultant
invite
kipp
over
for
what
be
know
in
the
business
as
a
conference
room
pilot
crp
the
first
of
a
series
of
trial
that
the
software
have
to
be
put
through
before
it
be
deem
to
be
ready
he
realize
that
thing
be
far
from
under
control
basically
a
crp
involves
run
the
business
in
a
simulation
mode
put
the
system
that
will
run
the
manufacturing
and
financial
operation
through
their
pace
within
the
first
couple
of
hour
as
he
move
from
room
to
room
kipp
felt
increasingly
uncomfortable
it
just
dawn
on
me
that
a
twenty
six
year
old
recent
graduate
from
budapest
technical
university
and
three
guy
from
oracle
in
san
jose
be
design
how
to
run
my
business
i
realize
i
d
be
focus
on
the
wrong
thing
pour
concrete
may
be
important
but
what
be
go
to
determine
on
a
daily
basis
sixty
to
eighty
percent
of
what
my
people
would
be
do
be
be
write
into
the
software
and
i
thought
shit
have
we
get
the
right
people
make
the
right
decision
what
convince
kipp
that
he
be
in
trouble
be
a
simulation
that
involve
pick
up
hypothetical
part
from
the
stockroom
to
assemble
on
one
of
the
turbine
unit
by
the
time
they
have
take
all
the
part
out
on
the
shop
floor
they
realize
they
be
work
on
the
wrong
job
kipp
say
the
software
be
design
that
way
because
people
from
my
finance
team
be
put
in
very
strict
requirement
for
track
cost
as
i
learn
more
about
it
i
say
this
be
crazy
if
this
be
to
go
live
we
ll
just
crash
the
whole
business
so
we
have
a
meeting
in
the
hallway
that
night
at
eleven
p
m
there
be
people
hang
off
the
door
i
ll
never
forget
it
i
say
what
be
you
try
to
do
we
don
t
need
this
level
of
sophistication
and
complexity
to
run
this
business
because
to
have
this
very
structure
financial
cost
system
mean
that
everything
have
to
be
do
differently
on
the
manufacturing
side
kipp
knew
that
if
they
continued
down
this
track
there
be
no
way
they
d
meet
the
promise
go
live
date
of
march
his
message
be
to
make
it
simpler
the
problem
be
that
ge
s
finance
and
manufacturing
specialist
from
america
have
believe
they
be
expect
to
add
value
by
get
oracle
to
customize
the
software
to
deliver
all
the
feature
kipp
might
possibly
want
unfortunately
they
hadn
t
thought
to
ask
him
and
the
oracle
consultant
be
train
never
to
say
no
to
a
customer
kipp
say
that
what
have
happen
be
the
key
to
understand
why
the
installation
of
business
software
system
so
often
go
wrong
you
decide
on
buying
a
piece
of
software
that
pretty
much
have
what
you
need
to
run
your
business
but
then
the
consultant
ask
what
would
you
really
like
it
to
do
because
we
want
to
optimize
your
business
process
so
the
guy
say
well
what
i
d
really
like
be
for
it
to
do
the
follow
and
they
have
the
same
conversation
with
the
finance
team
and
the
manufacturing
team
and
the
sale
guy
and
of
course
the
consultant
do
his
job
writes
down
all
the
little
other
thing
that
would
be
great
to
have
so
oracle
have
this
great
product
that
will
do
eighty
percent
of
what
you
want
just
by
throw
the
right
switch
in
the
software
no
special
code
or
anything
and
it
all
fall
down
because
someone
asks
that
innocent
little
question
what
else
would
you
like
it
to
do
kipp
say
that
if
they
hadn
t
be
suck
down
the
path
of
customization
they
might
have
gotten
the
software
instal
in
three
rather
than
five
month
the
key
be
the
commitment
of
his
own
time
as
much
as
half
of
each
work
day
for
at
least
a
couple
month
and
that
of
his
dozen
best
manager
he
say
that
it
s
no
good
expect
junior
people
to
make
the
right
decision
about
how
the
business
should
be
run
and
it
s
crazy
to
ask
them
to
do
it
he
admits
that
the
strain
of
it
nearly
kill
them
but
that
you
have
to
use
the
people
who
ve
really
get
that
mental
expertise
to
configure
the
system
right
from
a
process
standpoint
it
s
exactly
what
ellison
s
be
say
all
along
just
after
veresegyh

live
john
rice
call
kipp
over
to
orlando
to
share
his
experience
with
some
of
ge
s
other
senior
manager
kipp
say
i
told
them
don
t
let
it
happen
to
you
just
take
the
software
install
it
if
you
simplify
and
standardize
your
business
process
along
the
line
of
the
way
the
software
s
configure
you
re
go
to
get
eighty
percent
of
what
you
want
if
you
want
to
go
back
after
the
next
year
or
three
to
get
some
special
feature
you
need
you
can
still
do
that
by
way
of
example
he
told
oracle
that
if
he
need
improve
data
on
quality
the
chance
be
that
most
of
their
other
customer
would
too
oracle
s
response
be
that
if
he
could
wait
six
month
they
d
write
it
and
give
it
to
him
in
the
next
upgrade
instead
of
say
that
be
too
long
and
demand
a
customize
solution
kipp
say
ok
the
world
s
not
go
to
fall
apart
in
six
month
plus
i
ve
get
support
software
that
s
in
all
their
upgrade
not
some
special
code
that
i
have
to
take
responsibility
for
it
s
another
example
of
what
ellison
call
his
percent
rule
take
percent
functionality
now
rather
than
risk
never
finish
by
hold
out
for
a
percent
perfect
solution
that
exists
only
in
the
imagination
if
the
lesson
for
ge
be
clear
they
should
also
be
for
oracle

the

come
off

the

more
clearly
what

in

they

this

they

the
question
be
do
it
really
work
and
if
it
do
how
do
i
get
there
from
where
i
be
today
i
m
curious
to
know
how
many
of
these
customer
if
any
be
actually
use
the
whole

the

they
have
no

yet
for
the
fancy

piece
of
the
action
what
about
alcoa
well
when
i
say
that
some

be
use
the

i

they
re

not

nobody
not
even
oracle
us
all

we
don

because
we
don

manufacture
anything
however
i
still
describe

an

not

both
ge
and
alcoa
be
industrial

in
the

modernize
their

their

their

i

in
regular

call
at

after
we
ran
into
some
problem
a
couple
of
month
into
the

we
quickly
solve
those
problem
and
stayed
on
top
of
new
one
as
they
arose
during
every
call
we
go
through
major
product
and
implementation
issue
in
excruciate
detail
i
ve
learn
a
lot
in
the
process
i
m
go
to
try
to
spend
more
time
with
alcoa
because
it
s
a
huge
project
that
automates
all
the
different
alcoa
business
from
make
and
sell
boxcar
of
aluminum
ingot
to
consumer
package
aluminum
foil
another
big
project
i
m
watch
closely
be
at
posco
the
world
s
large
and
most
profitable
steel
company
they
re
do
a
big
bang
go
live
in
july
they
re
switch
over
the
entire
company
all
at
once
not
many
company
take
that
approach
because
of
the
risk
involve
but
if
you
pull
it
off
it
s
the
by
far
the
fast
way
to
go
it
take
iron
ball
to
go
that
route
but
hey
they
re
a
steel
company
so
anyway
i
always
recommend
a
safe
step
by
step
implementation
process
define
a
set
of
standard
process
bring
up
one
location
or
one
division
use
those
process
then
start
add
more
location
or
more
division
that
s
what
we
re
do
at
ge
that
s
what
we
re
do
at
alcoa
that
s
what
we
do
at
oracle
but
you
must
automate
one
business
at
a
time
not
one
department
at
a
time
one
department
at
a
time
automation
best
of
breed
system
that
don
t
work
across
departmental
boundary
that
s
how
company
get
in
the
mess
they
re
in
today
company
need
a
road
map
to
move
from
their
detach
departmental
system
with

disconnect
process

fragment

a
modern

the

ellison

focus
be
about

switch

i
m
back
to
spending
about
half
my
time
on
the

i
be

big

a
decade
it
s
not
an
easy
problem
microsoft
s
and
ibm
s
cluster
technology
work
fine
for
performance
benchmark
but
it
s
useless
for
real
application
they
run
cluster
test
and
then
run
an
ad
bragging
about
their
database
performance
that
s
good
marketing
but
marketing
can
only
carry
you
so
far
their
database
cluster
can
t
run
real
world
application
so
their
cluster
performance
test
be
meaningless
eventually
people
will
notice
but
our
cluster
isn
t
just
a
marketing
scam
our
cluster
work
with
real
world
application
and
that
fundamentally
change
the
database
business
forever

it
doesn

stop
there

the
principle
of

if

then
you

alter

that
s
exactly
what
we

who
build
huge
expensive
machine
ibm
say
gee
our
database
software
cost
less
per
processor
than
yours
we
say
true
enough
but
you
have
to
buy
software
for
twice
as
many
processor
and
then
spend
five
time
more
for
hardware
to
run
ibm
s
database
ibm
would
have
to
pay
you
to
run
their
database
for
it
to
make
economic
sense
even
if
they
give
you
all
the
software
and
hardware
for
free
it
still
wouldn
t
be
nearly
as
fast
or
reliable
as
an
oracle
i
cluster
so
oracle
i
be
the
last
database
this
be
game
set
and
match
in
the
database
business
oracle
i
cluster
make
it
very
difficult
for
ibm
and
microsoft
to
compete
on
performance
reliability
or
cost
we
ve
get
to
do
a
good
job
get
the
cluster
message
out
there
but
i
think
within
three
to
six
month
it
will
become
obvious
that
oracle
i
really
be
the
last
database
the
trouble
be
that
people
think
of
database
as
mature
technology
and
not
as
sexy
as
application
how
will
ellison
communicate
his
excitement
well
it
s
pretty
interest
if
you
can
show
eight
compaq
pc
server
run
faster
and
more
reliably
than
the
large
ibm
mainframe
and
those
pc
server
could
be
run
linux
people
say
linux
isn
t
reliable
enough
for
enterprise
compute
now
it
doesn
t
have
to
be
reliable
not
if
you
use
lot
of
them
if
one
fails
who
care
not
fast
enough
use
more
of
them
i
be
great
computer
science
not
just
another
software
product
it
s
i
hate
the
expression
a
breakthrough
bill
s
be
talk
a
lot
about
microsoft
s
horizontal
scalability
use
a
cluster
of
little
machine
to
get
performance
rather
than
one
big
machine
strategy
but
they
can
t
make
it
work
we
ve
get
horizontal
scalability
for
every
application
ever
write
they
have
horizontal
scalability
for
one
and
only
one
application
their
custom
version
of
the
tpc
c
benchmark
an
industry
standard
database
performance
test
it
s
amaze
and
it
will
take
ibm
and
microsoft
a
long
long
time
to
catch
up
maybe
ten
year
but
probably
never
if
ellison
s
claim
for
i
be
borne
out
it
s
not
only
bad
news
for
microsoft
s
and
ibm
s
database
product
it
will
also
have
some
pretty
serious
implication
for
the
hardware
maker
it
s
a
point
that
hasn
t
escape
him
it
will
fundamentally
change
the
high
end
of
the
compute
business
today
our
big
customer
like
ebay
the
internet
auction
site
be
run
big
sun
server
when
one
of
them
go
down
part
of
their
service
be
down
now
they
can
run
a
cluster
of
four
s
or
run
six
s
rather
than
one
big
the
cluster
be
cheaper
faster
and
a
lot
more
reliable
why
wouldn
t
you
run
a
cluster
ellison
have
just
met
with
scott
mcnealy
the
combative
bos
of
sun
microsystems
and
an
important
oracle
ally
do
he
realize
that
oracle
i
be
a
big
threat
to
his
business
i
don
t
think
he
do
right
now
for
the
first
few
year
people
will
cluster
two
big
machine
together
to
double
their
performance
and
get
fault
tolerance
but
as
they
gradually
see
how
well
cluster
work
they
ll
start
replace
their
big
machine
with
cluster
of
small
machine
that
s
not
good
news
for
anyone
who
build
big
fast
computer
the
sun
the
hp
superdome
the
ibm
s
all
these
expensive
sixteen
to
sixty
four
processor
computer
why
buy
them
you
want
sixty
four
processor
of
power
buy
sixteen
four
processor
pc
server
you
don
t
need
to
buy
these
really
big
machine
anymore
they
re
expensive
and
they
re
unreliable
because
a
single
machine
be
a
single
point
of
failure
if
it
break
you
re
down
why
would
anybody
spend
more
for
something
that
s
slow
and
less
reliable
big
box
be
go
to
be
replace
by
array
of
small
box
and
we
re
the
one
with
the
software
that
make
it
all
work
ellison
need
i
to
be
the
success
he
s
so
convince
it
will
be
although
oracle
have
maintain
its
overall
share
of
the
relational
database
business
a
report
from
gartner
that
s
due
out
in
a
few
day
suggests
that
ibm
be
grow
its
share
of
the
unix
market
a
good
deal
more
quickly
than
oracle
thanks
to
aggressive
pricing
and
the
naturally
much
cozier
relationship
it
enjoys
with
the
other
erp
and
crm
vendor
thanks
to
the
fact
it
doesn
t
compete
with
them
meanwhile
through
its
willingness
to
bundle
sql
server
with
its
other
backoffice
product
microsoft
have
overtaken
oracle
for
the
first
time
in
the
window
nt
segment
clearly
i
have
the
potential
for
oracle
to
open
up
more
blue
water
between
itself
and
its
database
competitor
while
also
provide
an
economic
case
base
on
total
ownership
cost
to
justify
its
much
fancier
price
tag
but
can
the
strength
of
i
be
leveraged
to
the
advantage
of
the
application
business
well
i
do
think
i
will
be
a
huge
success
this
be
a
little
bit
like
when
oracle
show
up
and
it
just
cream
everybody
i
think
i
will
sweep
away
the
competition
i
be
also
very
important
for
our
application
business
cluster
be
so
fast
and
so
reliable
now
even
our
large
application
customer
can
move
to
a
single
global
database
in
fact
we
re
think
about
reposition
our
application
and
focus
on
the
single
database
message
at
the
heart
of
the
e
business
suite
be
the
one
database
idea
one
customer
database
one
supplier
database
all
your
information
be
in
one
place
we
have
this
wonderful
unified
information
architecture
with
sap
and
siebel
you
have
dozen
of
customer
database
dozen
of
data
warehouse
it
s
really
hard
to
find
the
information
you
need
to
do
your
job
position
our
unified
information
architecture
sit
on
top
of
our
cluster
database
will
help
us
explain
the
benefit
of
the
e
business
suite
we
re
look
at
the
same
picture
but
we
re
look
at
it
through
a
different
lens
focus
on
the
database
as
the
center
of
our
application
strategy
have
another
advantage
it
allows
us
to
tackle
some
new
application
area
where
we
re
not
go
to
write
all
the
application
ourselves
instead
we
re
go
to
provide
and
publish
a
database
schema
with
the
necessary
apis
to
allow
other
apps
vendor
to
write
on
top
of
our
data
model
we
re
go
to
start
with
health
care
i
think
we
need
a
national
health
record
database
where
doctor
input
information
hospital
input
information
laboratory
input
information
all
your
health
care
record
be
in
one
database
it
s
highly
reliable
it
s
highly
secure
it
s
auditable
privacy
be
guaranteed
and
rapid
access
be
assure
in
case
of
emergency
we
have
a
variety
of
partner
like
ge
medical
who
we
re
try
to
get
to
build
application
on
top
of
our
national
health
record
database
if
oracle
be
to
succeed
in
persuade
lot
of
independent
software
vendor
to
develop
their
application
use
the
same
data
model
as
oracle
s
own
application
it
would
be
big
stuff
it
would
make
the
e
business
suite
limitlessly
extensible
by
offering
a
different
approach
to
integration
that
still
kept
all
the
information
in
one
place
paradoxically
it
would
even
be
a
way
of
make
best
of
breed
work
unfortunately
for
oracle
and
maybe
its
customer
ellison
will
probably
have
to
wait
a
long
time
for
rival
enterprise
application
vendor
to
allow
oracle
the
kind
of
leverage
over
them
through
its
database
that
microsoft
exercise
over
the
batter
and
submissive
pc
software
industry
through
window
work
with
niche
player
that
target
particular
industry
such
as
health
or
education
with
highly
specialized
software
be
a
smart
way
for
oracle
to
fill
out
the
functionality
of
the
suite
to
try
to
draw
a
line
under
its
early
instability
mark
jarvis
the
senior
vp
for
marketing
have
told
me
that
the
e
business
suite
might
soon
be
give
a
symbolic
release
ellison
be
skeptical
yes
i
thought
about
that
but
it
s
a
bad
idea
instead
we
re
just
go
to
try
to
do
a
well
job
of
explain
how
we
approach
application
from
a
databasecentric
point
of
view
we
don
t
need
a
relaunch
we
just
need
to
tell
the
market
about
how
much
specific
customer
have
save
and
how
fast
the
software
go
in
because
they
didn
t
modify
the
code
the
other
thing
we
need
to
do
be
talk
more
about
the
notion
of
databasecentric
application
all
your
application
built
around
a
single
central
database
people
already
believe
oracle
s
good
at
database
stuff
so
they
might
also
believe
we
re
good
at
databasecentric
application
and
you
know
what
it
s
not
only
believable
it
s
true
we
be
good
at
that
despite
ellison
s
confidence
about
overall
strategy
and
the
quality
of
oracle
s
product
the
impact
of
the
slowdown
in
technology
investment
and
the
deteriorate
economy
be
plenty
to
worry
about
with
one
of
the
trickiest
final
quarter
for
year
ready
to
close
have
the
visibility
that
have
be
so
cloud
a
month
ago
improve
it
s
very
odd
our
business
in
japan
be
do
extremely
well
and
they
ve
be
in
a
recession
for
around
ten
year
it
s
hard
to
understand
exactly
what
s
go
on
now
that
the
bubble
have
burst
those
who
enjoy
the
ride
up
be
now
have
an
unpleasant
ride
down
those
who
miss
some
of
the
ride
up
like
ibm
and
microsoft
don
t
have
as
far
to
fall
but
it
be
what
it
be
we
can
t
control
the
market
i
don
t
think
it
make
much
difference
whether
our
stock
be
flat
or
down
a
bit
in
the
long
run
what
really
determines
our
success
and
our
stock
price
be
how
good
our
product
be
and
our
product
be
really
really
good
right
now
all
we
need
be
more
reference
reference
be
the
key
to
sell
software
that
s
what
give
people
the
courage
to
buy
a
complex
almost
incomprehensible
piece
of
technology
sell
the
architecture
only
work
with
a
few
early
adopter
in
most
case
even
when
they
agree
that
our
application
architecture
be
much
well
they
ll
still
go
with
the
market
leader
people
buy
siebel
because
everyone
buy
siebel
people
have
an
innate
belief
that
there
be
safety
in
number
it
s
deep
inside
everyone
s
biology
so
until
we
have
a
significant
number
of
reference
include
people
who
threw
siebel
out
it
will
be
slow
go
so
for
now
we
re
just
go
to
take
it
hill
by
hill
deal
by
deal
until
we
have
a
strong
enough
foothold
for
our
sale
force
do
what
it
do
best
reference
sell
something
i
d
be
wonder
about
be
the
effect
on
oracle
s
business
of
ellison
s
bad
mouth
of
system
integrator
ellison
have
sort
of
apologize
and
recognize
his
error
but
be
he
do
anything
positive
to
rebuild
bridge
with
the
consult
and
si
partner
whom
he
have
manage
to
insult
and
annoy
ellison
say
i
ve
have
meeting
with
all
the
head
of
the
big
five
consult
firm
so
the
answer
be
yes
more
importantly
we
ve
make
a
couple
of
important
change
in
our
business
that
they
seem
to
like
first
we
change
our
motto
from
just
say
no
to
system
integration
which
be
stupid
to
just
say
no
to
custom
code
that
help
second
we
ve
be
gradually
downsize
our
consult
business
because
of
our
focus
on
rapid
low
cost
implementation
so
we
don
t
compete
with
the
big
integrator
very
much
anymore
we
specialize
on
get
in
and
out
very
quickly
that
make
sense
but
there
s
be
no
letup
in
deride
accenture
and
ibm
global
service
be
they
more
resistant
than
the
others
to
what
oracle
be
try
to
do
oracle
and
ibm
be
point
counterpoint
they
say
best
of
breed
we
say
integrate
suite
they
sign
ten
year
integration
and
outsource
contract
we
want
to
implement
in
six
month
or
less
it
s
unlikely
that
ibm
will
ever
do
much
application
integration
business
with
oracle
even
though
they
do
a
lot
of
work
with
our
database
the
ibm
hardware
and
service
guy
love
our
database
accenture
have
be
even
more
difficult
to
deal
with
than
ibm
i
really
don
t
understand
why
but
they
seem
to
think
meeting
with
us
be
a
waste
of
their
time
maybe
the
hard
feeling
date
back
to
the
robert
shaw
day
or
maybe
it
be
something
i
say
i
really
don
t
know
i
ve
have
a
couple
of
conversation
with
george
shaheen
before
he
go
to
webvan
a
struggle
internet
grocery
firm
that
would
soon
fold
but
they
lead
nowhere
we
d
love
to
work
with
accenture
but
so
far
we
ve
be
unable
to
get
them
interested
accenture
it
s
also
worth
point
out
be
an
investor
in
siebel
ellison
and
i
then
turn
to
discuss
the
future
of
the
spin
off
from
oracle
that
make
network
computer
device
now
know
as
new
internet
computer
the
same
one
that
be
meant
to
replace
the
pc
he
s
think
of
merge
the
company
with
a
little
firm
call
be
that
s
focus
on
develop
software
particularly
operating
system
for
internet
appliance
ellison
relaxes
and
his
tone
change
to
that
of
someone
talk
more
about
a
hobby
than
a
business
be
be
a
public
company
and
they
re
have
business
problem
not
good
but
they
ve
get
great
user
interface
technology
and
an
important
relationship
with
sony
nic
be
do
ok
million
last
quarter
million
this
quarter
they
re
tiny
but
grow
all
nic
really
be
be
a
desktop
computer
run
linux
and
a
netscape
browser
if
we
put
the
be
user
interface
on
top
of
linux
the
nic
would
be
easy
to
use
maybe
we
should
glue
these
two
company
together
a
potentially
much
more
important
initiative
be
ellison
s
plan
for
oracle
to
buy
netledger
a
start
up
run
by
a
former
oracle
programmer
name
evan
goldberg
that
have
produce
an
award
win
suite
of
web
base
application
aim
at
small
business
it
s
a
little
awkward
for
ellison
because
he
have
back
netledger
with
nearly
million
of
his
own
money
and
consequently
own
most
of
the
company
but
now
that
the
bursting
of
the
internet
bubble
have
kill
any
hope
of
an
ipo
ellison
want
to
bring
netledger
and
its
five
thousand
subscriber
into
the
oracle
fold
and
rebrand
the
software
as
oracle
small
business
suite
he
hope
that
intuit
the
firm
that
make
the
pc
base
quickbooks
accounting
application
for
professional
and
small
business
will
make
an
offer
for
netledger
and
thus
establish
fair
market
value
for
an
oracle
purchase
he
say
my
conflict
of
interest
prevents
me
from
get
involve
with
an
oracle
purchase
of
netledger
that
say
if
netledger
prof
to
be
successful
they
could
play
an
important
role
in
oracle
s
application
strategy
we
re
talk
to
a
large
auto
company
that
s
interested
in
provide
an
online
service
to
all
their
dealer
the
netledger
system
be
design
as
an
online
service
for
small
business
like
car
dealership
it
s
an
ideal
fit
it
s
also
an
interest
new
business
model
by
connect
the
netledger
service
to
our
e
suite
software
we
can
link
a
bunch
of
small
company
that
be
do
business
with
a
large
company
in
other
word
we
can
automate
network
of
company
rather
than
one
company
at
a
time
netledger
oracle
small
business
suite
could
turn
out
to
be
important
for
other
reason
microsoft
have
be
dip
a
toe
in
the
small
business
application
market
with
its
bcentral
web
site
in
december
it
also
spent
more
than
billion
to
buy
great
plain
an
application
firm
with
a
decent
franchise
in
the
small
and
medium
size
business
sector
it
s
clear
that
microsoft
want
net
to
offer
a
range
of
service
and
application
to
what
it
see
as
a
largely
untapped
market
ellison
agrees
market
research
predicts
that
the
small
business
software
market
will
be
worth
billion
by
and
ellison
think
that
he
can
use
netledger
both
to
get
a
big
slice
of
the
action
and
to
head
off
microsoft
s
effort
to
extend
its
application
franchise
beyond
the
desktop
he
say
intuit
be
one
of
the
few
survive
pc
software
company
they
ve
do
a
terrific
job
but
netledger
be
an
online
service
company
not
a
software
company
it
s
a
totally
new
business
model
an
online
service
have
a
much
low
cost
of
ownership
and
offer
a
lot
more
feature
than
intuit
s
quickbooks
or
any
other
small
business
software
include
microsoft
great
plain
nobody
be
go
to
beat
intuit
or
microsoft
in
the
small
business
software
market
but
if
it
s
a
war
between
service
and
software
then
i
think
the
service
model
will
win
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
microsoft
decide
to
offer
million
for
netledger
i
d
tell
them
to
get
fuck
i
suppose
evan
might
take
a
swing
at
me
but
i
own
per
cent
of
the
company
and
there
s
no
way
in
hell
microsoft
s
go
to
get
it

when
we
land
at
chicago
s
midway
airport
there
s
a
limo
wait
to
take
us
to
an
italian
steak
house
downtown
where
we
re
go
to
meet
jimmy
linn
or
the
judge
as
ellison
usually
refers
to
his
nephew
linn
be
the
son
of
doris
the
much
old
sister
he
grow
up
with
and
the
daughter
of
his
adoptive
father
lou
ellison
although
there
s
no
blood
relationship
the
linns
be
ellison
s
family
and
they
re
a
very
important
part
of
his
life
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
erie
caf
a
former
meatpacking
plant
near
river
north
the
dinner
s
already
in
full
swing
there
be
about
twelve
people
at
the
judge
s
table
nearly
all
of
them
be
lawyer
and
most
of
them
seem
to
have
met
ellison
before
it
s
a
very
traditional
place
with
dark
panel
wall
and
bare
brick
every
plate
groan
with
bleeding
slab
of
meat
the
twenty
four
ounce
t
bone
be
a
specialty
or
mountain
of
steam
pasta
and
the
lawyer
don
t
really
look
or
sound
like
lawyer
from
their
appearance
loud
sport
jacket
open
neck
shirt
and
plenty
of
gold
hang
from
wrist
and
neck
and
conversation
mostly
about
criminal
mayhem
of
one
kind
or
another
you
d
think
it
be
a
scene
from
the
soprano
the
judge
who
s
only
a
few
year
young
than
ellison
have
a
dark
tan
long
black
hair
and
a
zapata
moustache
it
s
the
first
time
i
ve
met
him
and
although
he
s
outgo
and
friendly
he
s
also
guard
he
doesn
t
like
the
treatment
ellison
have
receive
from
journalist
and
he
s
protective
of
his
famous
uncle
although
ellison
be
inevitably
the
center
of
attention
he
s
not
accord
any
special
treatment
there
s
a
lot
of
joking
and
tell
of
mostly
horrify
anecdote
about
chicago
lowlife
there
s
also
quite
a
bit
of
grouse
about
the
fall
in
oracle
s
stock
price
ellison
have
make
jimmy
wealthy
by
give
him
share
in
the
company
it
s
the
reason
he
could
afford
to
follow
his
father
onto
the
bench
and
several
of
the
others
at
the
table
have
personally
invest
in
oracle
ellison
assures
them
that
the
business
be
in
pretty
good
shape
but
he
s
not
prepared
to
say
when
he
think
the
stock
will
start
to
recover
the
only
thing
that
fazes
him
be
when
a
massive
plate
of
lamb
chop
arrives
for
him
ellison
love
his
food
but
the
sheer
size
of
the
portion
seem
to
rob
him
of
his
appetite
he
s
be
in
california
too
long
when
the
dinner
break
up
jimmy
who
s
picked
up
the
tab
put
a
braceleted
arm
around
me
and
say
that
unless
i
m
nice
about
his
uncle
he
ll
personally
kill
me
i
think
he
s
joking

the
next
day
s
roundtable
event
turn
out
to
be
for
chief
information
officer
rather
than
ceo
there
s
some
embarrassment
about
this
on
the
part
of
the
oracle
people
who
ve
make
the
arrangement
accord
to
protocol
ellison
really
shouldn
t
be
wheel
out
in
front
of
this
low
level
audience
maybe
sandy
sanderson
who
head
oracle
s
consult
organization
should
take
the
meeting
instead
ellison
decides
that
he
will
show
up
but
not
until
after
lunch
be
out
of
the
way
he
s
decide
that
from
now
on
even
with
a
room
full
of
ceo
they
should
eat
before
he
make
his
grand
entrance
it
s
difficult
to
make
the
pitch
he
say
if
you
have
already
use
up
all
your
best
line
on
the
people
sit
next
to
you
in
fact
perhaps
because
the
audience
be
make
of
cio
who
be
more
technically
savvy
than
their
boss
it
turn
out
to
be
a
rather
good
occasion
most
of
those
present
be
in
service
industry
such
as
health
education
and
the
chicago
police
department
when
ellison
finish
his
standard
confessional
riff
on
why
information
fragmentation
be
the
reason
that
expensive
computer
system
promise
much
but
deliver
little
he
s
drawn
into
an
interest
dialogue
with
the
cio
about
what
they
need
to
do
if
they
re
to
get
their
own
organization
to
follow
oracle
down
the
path
to

business
there
s
near
unanimity
that
in
the
word
of

from
an
it
perspective
we
have
island

figure
his

be
run
on
a

of
thirty
eight
different

when
it
could
be
use
just
six
five

which

when

down
the

you

in
my
penalty
box
without

the

in
their
camp
ellison
admits
they
ll
find
it
tough
new
software
be
a
great
catalyst
for
change
but
unless
people
be
willing
to
change
the
way
they
work
the
benefit
will
be
elusive

at

as
important
as
new

at

we
begin
with
a
project
to
put
in

the

way
we
work
those
new

process
lead
to
a
more
efficient
global
organizational

the
sum
of

these
change
be
a
new

it
be
a
surprise
end
to
what
begin
as
a
software
project
however
the
message
that
ellison
most
want
to
leave
this
technical
audience
with
be
the
idea
that
the

s
difficult
to
sell
without
customer
reference
maybe
we
begin
to
doubt
whether
we
could
pull
it
off
they
say
we
couldn
t
but
we
do
we
have
four
hundred
reference
now
and
next
year
there
will
be
thousand
no
one
else
be
even
try
to
build
what
we
ve
built
he
s
brought
with
him
the
slide
that
will
be
use
in
two
day
time
at
i
s
official
launch
the
idea
be
to
see
how
the
presentation
go
down
in
la
vega
and
tweak
it
as
necessary
at
first
ellison
promise
no
more
powerpoint
remember
sim
s
warn
on
the
way
in
but
just
as
suddenly
he
decides
to
use
slide
anyway
because
they
ll
help
him
show
just
how
amaze
a
database
i
really
be
oh
put
the
slide
up
and
then
afterwards
we
ll
talk
about
comp
one
of
the
slide
compare
the
transaction
speed
of
oracle
run
on
ibm
s
fast
unix
computer
compare
with
db
it
s
base
on
an
ad
that
oracle
be
about
to
run
it
show
a
tall
red
column
for
oracle
and
for
ibm
a
blue
stump
that
doesn
t
extend
much
beyond
the
bottom
of
the
chart
ellison
explains
when
ibm
want
to
show
how
fast
their
fast
computer
ran
they
use
oracle
ibm
won
t
even
say
how
fast
db
run
on
the
same
computer
there
be
two
possibility
the
first
be
that
db
be
so
fast
that
ibm
doesn
t
want
to
embarrass
us
that
s
one
possibility
the
second
possibility
be
that
they
run
like
a
snail
i
think
we
re
deal
with
escargot
folk
in
the
testosterone
charge
atmosphere
that
ellison
have
carefully
stoke
it
brings
the
roof
down
an
important
part
of
ellison
s
argument
be
that
ibm
s
db
be
actually
two
entirely
different
product
an
excellent
database
that
run
on
mainframe
and
that
be
capable
of
run
real
world
application
across
cluster
albeit
slowly
and
expensively
and
a
vastly
inferior
product
that
have
a
completely
different
architecture
and
can
run
only
briefly
the
tpc
c
benchmark
across
different
computer
ellison
jeer
it
s
like
painting
the
word
boeing
on
the
side
of
a
roller
skate
and
call
it
a
db
on
mainframe
be
a
fine
product
with
real
cluster
capability
db
on
unix
and
window
be
a
totally
different
product
with
cluster
capability
that
s
only
good
for
marketing
it
s
totally
useless
for
run
real
application
you
expect
this
kind
of
thing
from
the
boy
in
seattle
microsoft
they
re
new
to
the
database
business
they
might
not
even
know
their
cluster
be
useless
but
ibm
should
know
well
ellison
then
explains
the
different
architecture
share
disk
for
db
on
mainframe
and
oracle
i
on
unix
window
and
linux
versus
share
nothing
for
the
other
db
which
he
describes
as
a
piece
of
garbage
who
s
right
he
asks
the
mainframe
db
guy
at
ibm
or
the
unix
db
guy
the
product
be
totally
different
they
can
t
both
be
right
it
s
a
difficult
question
for
ibm
to
answer
so
we
re
go
to
keep
ask
it
db
on
unix
be
an
imposter
its
share
nothing
architecture
be
good
for
nothing
it
doesn
t
deserve
the
ibm
logo
oracle
i
be
the
last
database
with
that
ellison
turn
to
sing
the
praise
of
the
newly
release
ia
application
server
as
be
now
the
fast
and
cheapest
middleware
in
the
world
a
week
earlier
ellison
make
a
rambunctious
appearance
at
the
java
one
conference
for
java
developer
at
the
moscone
center
in
san
francisco
despite
the
near
hysteric
of
sun
s
pr
people
who
have
want
java
one
to
be
an
anodyne
celebration
of
the
java
community
ellison
use
his
time
on
stage
to
proclaim
the
superior
performance
of
ia
over
the
rival
product
from
cosponsor
bea
system
that
currently
dominates
the
web
application
server
market
ellison
have
set
out
to
demonstrate
that
while
bea
be
much
well
than
ibm
s
websphere
accord
to
oracle
s
test
twice
as
fast
rather
than
half
as
fast
as
ibm
claimed
it
s
so
easy
to
get
those
metric
confuse
joked
ellison
ia
be
three
time
faster
than
the
market
leader
bea
s
bos
bill
coleman
as
ellison
now
gleefully
related
to
his
troop
in
la
vega
have
not
be
amuse
bill
like
the
first
slide
show
how
much
faster
bea
be
than
websphere
but
he
didn
t
like
the
second
slide
major
bummer
in
fact
he
say
afterwards
that
larry
have
just
make
the
number
up
onstage
he
say
i
lie
shock
he
really
hurt
my
feeling
a
bit
later
when
he
found
out
that
all
my
number
be
base
on
certify
performance
test
result
do
you
know
what
he
say
then
bill
coleman
say
performance
doesn
t
matter
performance
doesn
t
matter
be
that
right
we
re
go
to
feed
those
word
right
back
to
bill
in
our
next
bea
comparison
ad
yes
folk
we
be
a
kinder
gentler
oracle
these
day
the
audience
roar
its
approval
it
s
time
for
question
from
the
floor
the
first
one
s
easy
what
s
ellison
s
take
on
microsoft
ellison
reply
the
x
box
look
fabulous
they
ve
finally
found
something
they
re
really
good
at
we
don
t
compete
with
microsoft
sql
server
be
a
joke
we
don
t
make
spreadsheet
or
word
processor
so
we
don
t
see
much
of
microsoft
in
the
market
the
only
time
i
think
about
them
be
when
my
window
machine
blow
up
have
spent
much
of
the
second
half
of
the
s
appear
to
fight
a
holy
war
with
microsoft
over
the
direction
of
compute
ellison
s
approach
now
be
to
portray
it
as
irrelevant
to
oracle
s
future
while
oracle
be
the
leader
in
the
serious
world
of
supply
complete
business
information
system
to
company
microsoft
be
deride
as
a
company
that
be
increasingly
focus
on
consumer
market
where
its
main
rival
be
aol
time
warner
the
next
question
be
a
little
trickier
although
it
s
one
that
ellison
have
be
expect
an
intense
face
clearly
nervous
young
man
sit
near
the
back
of
the
hall
asks
ellison
about
comp
he
say
that
they
ve
recently
be
told
via
a
conference
call
that
there
will
be
no
money
for
raise
in
the
second
half
of
the
fiscal
year
just
end
be
this
really
true
the
hall
be
suddenly
completely
silent
but
by
the
time
he
s
through
the
young
man
sound
more
angry
than
frighten
and
when
he
sits
down
he
get
a
big
cheer
for
be
bold
enough
to
say
what
s
on
everybody
s
mind
even
though
he
s
be
expect
the
question
ellison
still
look
slightly
uncomfortable
you
obviously
drew
the
short
straw
he
joke
but
the
truth
be
that
we
ve
have
a
really
crappy
year
especially
the
last
two
quarter
we
share
the
success
and
we
share
the
pain
when
thing
be
go
well
we
pay
out
huge
raise
and
bonus
when
thing
aren
t
go
so
well
we
don
t
give
out
raise
and
bonus
because
there
s
no
money
for
them
the
stock
s
down
to
fifteen
dollar
i
m
sorry
about
that
but
it
s
a
fact
of
life
we
re
all
suffer
together
but
because
we
re
watch
every
penny
we
spend
we
ve
be
able
to
avoid
layoff
cisco
laid
off
thousand
we
re
watch
every
penny
we
spend
so
we
can
preserve
our
team
intact
so
you
re
all
here
to
fight
again
this
year
we
have
a
long
tradition
of
pay
people
well
at
oracle
you
can
make
it
all
back
and
more
this
year
it
just
depends
on
how
much
you
sell
i
wonder
how
the
stuff
about
share
pain
will
go
down
most
of
the
people
in
the
ballroom
know
that
ellison
cashed
in
million
worth
of
stock
at
the
begin
of
the
year
either
they
re
too
polite
scar
to
mention
it
or
the
juxtaposition
doesn
t
trouble
them
one
of
the
more
senior
salesman
get
up
to
say
that
the
current
situation
reminds
him
of
when
ellison
sent
all
employee
an
e
mail
describe
the
crisis
and
the
step
that
he
be
take
to
resolve
it
what
be
he
do
to
help
oracle
through
its
present
crisis
ellison
be
a
little
shock
at
the
comparison
and
start
to
talk
about
some
of
the
thing
that
he
s
do
to
low
cost
such
as
use
the
internet
to
move
customer
support
from
high
price
market
such
as
britain
and
the
united
state
to
india
but
he
say
this
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
economy
it
s
what
oracle
would
be
do
anyway
automate
away
job
save
head
count
and
improve
service
the
whole
point
of
the
e
business
suite
be
to
do
more
with
less
that
s
what
we
sell
it
for
then
he
start
to
waffle
about
add
people
in
development
and
maybe
in
sale
too
but
say
that
oracle
be
a
tough
place
to
be
if
you
re
a
mediocre
sale
performer
realize
he
s
lose
his
audience
ellison
stop
himself
and
say
what
he
ought
to
have
earlier
this
be
nothing
like
we
be
on
the
verge
of
go
out
of
business
then
our
performance
this
q
may
have
be
disappoint
for
us
but
it
would
have
be
glorious
success
for
almost
anyone
else
a
couple
of
question
later
ellison
be
ask
what
oracle
s
great
challenge
be
his
answer
be
interest
the
big
challenge
be
this
year
s
application
technology
transition
it
put
huge
stress
on
the
entire
organization
it
be
like
the
move
from
oracle
to
oracle
it
be
oracle
that
save
oracle
the
e
business
suite
have
be
a
difficult
transition
but
we
ve
cross
the
chasm
i
wasn
t
perfect
when
it
come
out
how
could
it
have
be
it
s
five
time
more
complex
than
the
product
it
replace
but
we
be
right
to
be
ambitious
there
s
nothing
else
like
it
first
we
have
to
persuade
ourselves
only
then
can
we
convince
the
rest
of
the
world
with
that
ellison
be
do
he
leaf
the
ballroom
with
the
audience
still
stand
and
clap
the
effect
be
clearly
calculate
while
other
oracle
senior
executive
be
accessible
and
will
stay
overnight
to
get
drunk
and
party
the
charismatic
leader
maintains
some
distance
between
himself
and
his
troop

a
couple
of
day
later
it
s
time
for
the
official
launch
of
oracle
i
after
the
troubled
infancy
of
the
e
business
suite
oracle
could
do
with
some
good
publicity
and
ellison
be
convince
that
the
advanced
technology
of
i
especially
real
application
cluster
will
blow
the
mind
of
the
journalist
and
analyst
who
have

invite
to

near
the
front
the
analyst
be
behind
them
and
to
the
right
be
the
oracle
employee
some
from
marketing
but
mainly
the
middle
age
rather
academic
look
guy
from
the
database
development
group
who
be
on
hand
to
do
one
to
one
briefing
when
the
main
show
be
over
when
ellison
sweep
in
he
move
quickly
into
the
pitch
for
i
that
go
down
well
in
la
vega
he
s
try
to
get
across
an
idea
that
he
fear
cynical
journalist
and
analyst
will
be
naturally
resistant
to
that
i
be
not
just
an
incremental
improvement
over
its
predecessor
but
a
breakthrough
product
with
the
potential
both
to
transform
the
economics
of
corporate
compute
and
to
render
the
rival
database
from
ibm
and
microsoft
terminally
obsolete
to
ellison
this
be
not
just
marketing
bombast
he
be
convince
it
s
true
he
can
hardly
contain
his
excitement
oracle
i
be
the
superweapon
that
will
not
only
win
the
war
but
convince
the
enemy
that
far
resistance
be
futile
that
s
why
ellison
call
the
database
team
the
boy
from

there

always
be
a
trade
off
between

as
corporate

try
to
add

they
have
have
to

even
then
the

limited
to
highly
specialized

the

no
wonder
ellison
have
convince
himself
that
it
be
the
firm
s
most
important
step
forward
in
database
technology
since
it
come
up
with
the
world
s
first
commercial
sql
relational
database
management
system
a
quarter
century
ago
ellison
begin
the
show
with
a
slide
outline
oracle
s
original
design
target
for
i
to
improve
performance
by
a
factor
of
five
while
halve
the
cost
a
far
goal
be
to
achieve
ten
time
the
reliability
there
be
he
say
just
two
way
to
get
well
database
performance
use
either
faster
software
or
faster
hardware
make
oracle
i
the
fast
database
on
a
single
computer
wasn
t
the
problem
on
the
tpc
c
standard
benchmark
it
could
comfortably
handle
four
time
the
number
of
transaction
a
minute
as
microsoft
s
sql
server
while
ibm
be
not
prepared
to
publish
any
benchmark
for
the
unix
nt
version
of
db
interestingly
ellison
say
when
ibm
want
to
show
how
fast
its
most
powerful
unix
computer
be
the
benchmark
be
run
use
oracle
rather
than
db
ellison
jeer
ibm
couldn
t
even
persuade
its
own
hardware
guy
across
the
hall
to
use
db
even
though
it
be
free
but
hit
the
ten
time
improve
cost
performance
target
simply
wasn
t
possible
on
a
single
computer
really
fast
computer
be
not
only
very
expensive
say
ellison
but
one
high
end
computer
be
also
a
single
point
of
failure
so
the
aim
of
get
ten
time
well
reliability
be
also
not
possible
why
have
nobody
use
cluster
because
the
only
database
that
would
run
real
application
be
db
on
mainframe
pretty
much
the
only
application
that
would
run
on
cluster
in
a
unix
nt
environment
be
the
benchmarking
software
use
to
measure
tpc
c
performance
so
unless
you
happen
to
run
your
business
on
a
benchmarking
application
cluster
wasn
t
likely
to
be
a
whole
lot
of
use
to
you
the
problem
ellison
explains
be
one
of
architecture
the
architecture
of
the
db
cluster
on
mainframe
be
call
share
disk
which
mean
that
any
computer
in
the
cluster
can
get
at
percent
of
the
data
but
the
cluster
architecture
use
by
the
other
db
and
sql
server
be
know
as
share
nothing
apart
from
the
benchmarking
software
the
problem
with
share
nothing
be
that
the
only
application
it
will
run
be
customize
one
offs
it
won
t
run
the
package
apps
that
be
use
in
the
real
world
and
ellison
say
it
get
bad
first
of
all
share
nothing
cluster
be
very
hard
to
manage
if
you

a

the

unstable
with

computer
each

the

of
just

will
bring
down
the

in
other
word
from
a

there
be
not
just
one

oracle
s

his

be
to

while
ellison
play
the

rather
unconvincingly
of
the

who
asks

the

with

approach
jarvis
claim

the

hooked
up
via
the

to
an

data
center
at

both
system
chug
along
at

the

then
jarvis
take
out
one

the

processing
fall
by
about
percent
the

reduce
slightly
in

otherwise
the

he
then

the

treatment
to
the
ibm

which
predictably
but
nonetheless
quite
dramatically
can
t
take
it
within
a

because
only

the

not

it

they

do
what
they

ellison
turn

the
issue
of
how

over
the

it
accordingly
it
s
be
unpopular
because
some
customer
upgrade
their

have
resent
pay
oracle
more
money
for

several
of

ellison

the

he
s
incense
by
the
suggestion
that

work
out
cheaper

the

the

of
the

before

if

ellison

it

the

back
down
on

it

a

how
a

that
spends
as
much
time
and
money
on

could
have
make
such
an
elementary
mistake
but
it
get
bad
when
ellison
finish
speak
a
local
newspaper

name
tom
mcewen
want
a

from

midnight

him
about

he
could
fly
his
gulfstream
into
san
jose
airport
late
at

ellison
have
claimed
that
the
airport
authority
be
unfairly
discriminate
against
him
on
account
of
the
weight
of
his

rather
than
its
noisiness

the
ruling
by

still
he

oh
my
god
he
groan
raise
his

his

in
a

of
exasperation
most
of
the
question
that
follow
be
about

be
this
a
disguise
price
cut
because
of
the
pressure
from

if
so
what
impact
will
it
have
on

the
answer
be
no
and
none
it
s
just
a
question

use
a
comparable
metric
and
anyway
oracle

always
make

the

ellison
responds
almost
wearily
with

you
use
less

the
economics
of

industry
actually
have
very
little
to
do
with
the

of

only
a
few
question
be
about
the
radical

a

ellison

be
keen
to

sun
e
ellison
equivocates
we
have
a
good
relationship
with
both
sun
and
intel
but
we
ve
always
hesitate
to
recommend
intel
for
mission
critical
application
because
their
server
hardware
be
relatively
small
and
the
microsoft
operating
system
be
so
fragile
but
with
rac
none
of
that
matter
anymore
you
get
the
performance
you
need
from
cluster
lot
of
small
server
together
and
if
a
few
should
fail
no
problem
the
system
keep
run
so
rac
make
low
cost
intel
server
viable
in
the
data
center
but
sun
have
very
competitively
price
small
server
and
they
have
a
great
operating
system
it
s
really
about
small
machine
versus
big
high
end
machine
not
sun
versus
intel
the
truth
be
that
sun
be
pretty
competitive
at
the
low
end
because
it
have
to
be
but
it
s
not
where
it
make
its
money
if
big
fast
computer
can
be
replace
with
group
of
little
one
it
s
seriously
bad
news
for
oracle
s
old
hardware
partner

ellison
know
it
what
ellison
isn
t
let
on
be
that
he
have
decide
to
throw
oracle

weight
behind

sixty
four
bit

when
and
if

debut
next

ellison
isn
t
about
to
say
anything
disparage
about

in
public
but
what
he
s
planning
not
to
mention
what
oracle
have
already
do
with
rac
could
turn
out
to
be
far
more
damage

ellison
start
off
by
ram

his
message
about
data
fragmentation
it
s
the
issue
it
s
that
simple
what
s
unique
about
oracle
he
argues
be
its
combination
of
a
datacentric
information
architecture
and
the
ease
with
which
the
e
business
suite
can

extend
because
oracle
us
java
rather
than
the
proprietary
tool
of
its
rival
application
vendor
the
key
difference
between
oracle
and
the
others
its
counterpoint
be
information
management
ellison
say
that
he
doesn
t
believe
in
separate
data
warehouse
from
transaction
processing
because
too
much
time
be
lose
the
combination
of

another
feature
on

that
automatically
maintains
both
old
and
new
version
of
the
same
data
would
make
warehouse
irrelevant
burton
volunteer
that
one
of
the
benefit
of
this
be
that
it
reduces
conflict
between
two
separate

absolutely
purr
ellison
ellison
feel
strongly
that
the
analyst
haven
t
yet
give
oracle
enough
credit
for
rac
because
they
be
hostile
to
real
innovation
it
s
like

the

every
time
he

a
new

the
pope
threaten

kill
him
instead
of
talk
up

why
not

that
with

all
it
can

really

down
into
this
he
demand
write

ask
ibm
why
its
unix
database
take
a
different
architectural
approach
from
its
mainframe
version
please
write
this
down
why
won
t
ibm
demonstrate
the
speed
of
their
hardware
with
their
own
database
you
guy
always
say
we
re
more
expensive
than
ibm
but
it
s
the
cost
of

that

the

the

the

a
tiny

you

have
all
fall

it
have
let
off
steam
ellison
answer
question
on
everything
from
peer

peer
compute
which
he
dismisses
as
a
cute
little
technology
that
s
good
for

music
but
not
something
for
the

ellison

in
a
very
few
year
the
bulk
of

business
will
be
on

we

the
conventional

be
all
wrong
where
the

ellisonian

during

the

investment
firm

some
of

its

on

market
indicator
and
its
percent
and
large

of

the

and

be
far
from

that
oracle
as
a
company
be
fail
quite
the
opposite
but
the
overall
impression
the

give
be
highly
negative
thanks
in
part
to
its
last
line
we

that

will
leave
an

get

well
with
such
an
influential
constituency
she
be
in
no
doubt
we
fundamentally
need
to
change
the
relationship
with
the

we
must
talk
to
them
more

t
broadcast
to
them
listen
to
their
advice

if
at
all
possible
incorporate
it
in
your
planning
marketing

development
historically
oracle
have
never
have
that
kind
of

i

her
that
i
found
it
hard
to
imagine
ellison
whom
she
have
yet
to
meet
take
that
advice
to
heart
the
analyst
be
prepared
to
give
larry
a
bit
more
room
because
he
s
larry
she
say
but
the
folk
underneath
larry
who
copy
that
style
won

get
away
with
it
i

them
with

they
know
how
to
be

they
should
try
treat
analyst
like
customer
o
neill
be
almost
certainly
right
but
i
found
it
hard
to
imagine
oracle
schmooze
analyst
and
journalist
with
the
polish
and
attention
of
say
an

the

an
odd

both
of
which
be

from

what

it

the
fact
that
microsoft

microsoft

old

sybase
more
than
a
decade

but
despite
attempt
by
microsoft
to
present
the
late
version
of
its
sql

as
be
sufficiently
capable
for

center
duty
its
deployment
be
still
mostly
departmental

microsoft
would
like
nothing

to
destroy

profitability
by
commoditizing
the

business
the

so
far
thwart

sql

remains
essentially
a
good
enough

that
s
bundle

put
some

pressure
on

its
work

he
initiate

have
not

evolve
into
the
much
broader
war
on

create
an
awareness
both
of
oracle
and
of
its
vision
of
compute
that
nothing
else
could
have
achieve
since
then
although
microsoft

wealth
have
grown
almost
exponentially
thanks
to
its
near
monopoly
profit
from

have
quite
the
aura
of
invincibility
it

previously
enjoy

to
the

compute
have
move
decisively
toward
a
model
that
played
much
more
to
oracle
s
strength
than
to
microsoft
s
as
for
the
antitrust
case
against
microsoft
that
have
arisen
from
its
brutal
suppression
of
netscape
it
have
not
only
hugely
distract
its
senior
management
but
do
great
damage
to
the

reputation
a
few
day
after
i
discuss
these
issue
with
ellison
the
washington
d
c
court
of
appeal
found
microsoft
guilty
of
serially
abuse
its
monopoly
power

the
controversial
remedy
of
district
court
judge

penfield
jackson
that
it
should
be
broken
into
two
company
ellison
s
antipathy
toward
microsoft
seem
to
go
much
far
than
simply
see
it
as
a
dangerous
business
adversary
he
once
say
to
me
that
what
he
really
didn

like
about

that
it
didn

have
any
taste
what

well
actually
i
be
quote
steve

he
say
that
the
thing
that
really
bother
him
most
about
microsoft
be
not
how
successful
they
be
or
how
much
money
they
have
it
s
the
tasteless
mediocrity
of
their
software
i
totally
agree
with
steve
microsoft
s
software
be
rarely
first
rate
they
never
ever
innovate
but
they
re
pretty
good
copier
all
those
bright
people
up
in
redmond
remind
me
of
the
guy
you
see
sit
in
museum
make
beautiful
copy
of
great
art
their
picture
be
beautiful
but
they
re
copy
forgery
ever
since
the
guilty
verdict
in
the
antitrust
case
bill
begin
chant
microsoft
s
new
mantra
please
please
don
t
take
away
our
right
to
innovate
microsoft
innovate
give
me
a
fuck
break
the
innovation
for
the
internet
come
from
netscape
all
microsoft
do
be
copy
netscape
s
browser
and
bundle
a
free
copy
of
the
browser
with
window
but
it
wasn
t
really
free
at
all
microsoft
get
paid
for
its
free
browser
by
raise
the
price
of
window
but
netscape
couldn
t
charge
for
its
browser
because
microsoft
include
a
free
browser
as
a
part
of
window
it
be
a
brilliant
business
strategy
it
kill
netscape
but
it
s
illegal
now
microsoft
be
try
to
do
the
exact
same
thing
to
realnetworks
the
innovator
of
internet
stream
video
and
audio
by
bundling
a
free
medium
player
with
window
they
ll
just
keep
do
it
over
and
over
again
until
somebody
penalizes
them
for
do
it
you
re
get
to
give
them
credit
for
ball
but
not
for
innovation
even
bill
s
business
strategy
be
just
a
copy
of
standard
oil
s
strategy
back
in
the
s
but
when
rockefeller
use
his
monopoly
to
crush
his
competitor
it
wasn
t
illegal
there
be
no
antitrust
law
back
then
so
what
s
microsoft
s
single
great
innovation
take
your
time
it
s
a
trick
question
there
aren
t
any
all
that
money
microsoft
spends
on
research
what
have
they
get
to
show
for
it
nothing
compare
that
to
ibm
s
research
result
ibm
invent
the
disk
drive
they
invent
core
memory
they
invent
the

tunnel
microscope
they
invent
fractal

the
list
of
ibm
invention
go
on
and
on
ibm
researcher
have
won
nobel
prize
ibm
at
the
height
of
their
greatness
be
a
national
treasure
an
institution
that
anyone
would
be
proud
to
be
a
part
of
they
don
t
do
software
very
well
anymore
but
their
old
mainframe
stuff
be
great
i
make
fun
of
a
lot
of
other
database
all
other
database
in
fact
except
the
mainframe
version
of
db
it
s
a
first
rate
piece
of
technology
microsoft
may
have
more
money
than
ibm
ever
do
but
they
don
t
have
more
idea
it
s
the
difference
between
a
great
fashion
designer
in
paris
and
someone
who
just
do
knockoff
in
brooklyn
except
that
microsoft
would
bundle
the
dress
with
window
and
give
them
away
for
free
there
be
few
thing
that
ellison
loathes
more
than
hypocrisy
it
s
one
of
the
reason
that
people
often
find
him
objectionable
he
almost
never
say
the
politically
correct
thing
whether
the
subject
be
date
oracle
employee
or
how
he
spends
his
money
if
he
think
he
s
in
danger
of
sound
sanctimonious
he
ll
suddenly
shut
up
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
more
than
anything
it
be
gate
s
hypocrisy
about
the
right
to
innovate
that
infuriate
ellison
i
didn
t
despise
bill
for
destroy
netscape
which
wasn
t
very
nice
or
legal
for
that
matter
bill
just
calculate
he
could
smash
his
competitor
by
break
the
law
and
get
away
it
who
know
maybe
he
can
but
when
bill
defend
microsoft
s
murderous
behavior
by
say
all
i
ask
be
the
right
to
innovate
that
kind
of
push
me
over
the
edge
netscape
do
the
innovation
bill
that
s
why
you
kill
them
all
you
do
be
copy
the
innovation
and
destroy
the
innovator
to
kill
the
innovator
in
the
name
of
innovation
be
such
an
incredible
lie
such
a
cynical
piece
of
deception
such
hyperhypocrisy
i
just
couldn
t
stand
it
if
bill
have
say
we
kill
netscape
because
they
be
in
our
way
they
weren
t
tough
enough
to
survive
so
fuck
em
hey
andreessen
marc
andreessen
found
netscape
when
he
be
twenty
one
welcome

punk
i
ve
get
a
little
present
for
you
it
s
a
pine
box
and
a
bullet
with
your
name
on
it
that
ll
teach
little
kid

stay
the
fuck
out
of
my
neighborhood
mess
with
microsoft
you
die
okay
cool
that
s
still
not
very
nice
but
at
least
it
s
honest
for
a
couple
of
year
between
when
microsoft
do
its
deal
with
sybase
and
when
oracle
arrive
to
save
his
bacon
ellison
regard
gate
as
a
direct
competitor
but
for
most
of
the
time
at
least
until
ellison
launch
his
attack
on
the
pc
in
the
wake
of
the
release
of
window
these
be
profound
difference
between
oracle
and
microsoft
one
be
a
desktop
company
the
other
be
server
base
one
be
window
the
other
largely
unix
one
believe
in
the
proprietary

route
the
other
be

standard
actually
make
it
easy
for
the
two
men
to
get
along
ellison
say
bill
and
i
use
to
be
friend
insofar
as
bill
have
friend
back
in
the
eighty
and
early
ninety
all
the
people
in
the
pc
software
industry
hat
bill
because
they
fear
bill
but
oracle
didn
t
compete
with
microsoft
very
much
back
then
so
we
get
on
pretty
well
as
i
get
to
know
bill
i
developed
a
great
respect
for
the
thoroughness
of
his
think
and
his
relentless
remorseless
pursuit
of
industry
domination
i
found
spending
time
with
bill
intellectually
interest
but
emotionally
exhaust
he
have
absolutely
no
sense
of
humor
i
think
he
find
humor
an
utter
waste
of
time
an
unnecessary
distraction
from
the
business
at
hand
scary
stuff
i
don
t
have
anything
like
that
kind
of
focus
or
single
mindedness
one
telephone
conversation
with
gate
in
stick
in
ellison
s
mind
it
be
the
most
interest
conversation
i
ve
ever
have
with
bill
and
the
most
reveal
it
be
around
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
we
be
on
the
phone
discuss
some
technical
issue
i
don
t
remember
what
it
be
anyway
i
didn
t
agree
with
him
on
some
point
and
i
explain
my
reason
bill
say
i
ll
have
to
think
about
that
i
ll
call
you
back
then
i
get
this
call
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
it
s
bill
continue
the
conversation
with
yeah
i
think
you
re
right
about
that
but
what
about
a
and
b
and
c
i
say
bill
have
you
be
think
about
this
for
the
last
five
hour
he
say
yes
he
have
it
be
an
important
issue
and
he
want
to
get
it
right
now
bill
want
to
continue
the
discussion
and
analyze
the
implication
of
it
all
i
be
just
stun
he
have
take
the
time
and
effort
to
think
it
all
through
and
have
decide
i
be
right
and
he
be
wrong
now
most
people
hate
to
admit
they
re
wrong
but
it
didn
t
bother
bill
one
bit
all
he
care
about
be
what
be
right
not
who
be
right
that
s
what
make
bill
very
very
dangerous
most
people
be
so
in
love
with
their
own
idea
that
it
confines
their
think
creates
boundary
and
limit
their
ability
to
solve
problem
bill
however
have
this
asian
like
ability
to
manage
his
intellectual
vanity
and
take
idea
regardless
of
where
they
come
from
and
put
them
to
work
for
microsoft
the
terrify
thing
about
bill
be
that
he
s
smart
enough
to
understand
what
idea
be
good
what
s
worth
replicate
and
he
have
the
discipline
and
resource
to
get
on
with
it
and
make
it
just
a
little
bit
well
that
s
very
japanese
that
s
very
scary
add
that
to
bill
s
ruthless
perseverance
and
the
fact
that
microsoft
have
more
money
than
god
and
you
get
a
most
formidable
foe
the
ultimate
foe
the
perfect
enemy
we
pick
our
enemy
very
carefully
we
decide
to
pick
a
fight
with
the
big
most
dangerous
bully
in
the
schoolyard
there
s
no
way
to
avoid
this
fight
so
let
s
start
it
ellison
s
decision
to
start
attack
microsoft
in
be
base
on
the
same
reason
as
today
s
attack
by
oracle
on
ibm
if
i
want
to
make
a
point
i
have
to
compare
it
to
a
counterpoint
i
can
t
explain
hot
without
compare
it
to
cold
in
fact
there
s
no
such
thing
as
hot
without
cold
everything
s
relative
so
i
attack
microsoft
this
be
what
they
think
this
be
what
we
think
constant
comparison
between
our
internet
centric
server
technology
and
their
window
centric
desktop
technology
provide
increase
clarity
the
battle
line
be
now
clearly
drawn
it
be
microsoft
versus
the
internet
the
common
heritage
of
all
mankind
we
be
part
of
team
mankind
the
last
best
hope
to
prevent
total
world
domination
by
the
evil
empire
in
redmond
very
colorful
stuff
anyway
it
make
it
interest
for
journalist
analyst
and
customer
we
get
a
lot
of
press
it
be
suppose
to
be
a
battle
between
two
rival
compute
architecture
it
wasn
t
suppose
to
degenerate
into
a
me
versus
bill
thing
but
people
be
more
interested
in
personality
than
technology
so
that
s
what
it
become
billionaire
a
versus
billionaire
b
i
get
onto
the
cover
of
fortune
magazine
as
software
s
other
billionaire
oracle
s
technical
idea
and
product
go
along
for
the
ride
the
battle
of
the
billionaire
be
good
brand
building
for
oracle
at
that
time
the
company
we
want
to
be
compare
to
be
microsoft
to
what
extent
have
ellison
really
believe
that
his
network
computer
be
go
to
take
over
the
world
or
have
it
always
be
more
of
a
stick
to
beat
microsoft
with
and
a
way
to
dramatize
philosophical
difference
about
compute
architecture
when
i
introduce
our
new
internet
compute
architecture
i
emphasize
what
be
new
about
it
how
it
be
different
from
the
client
server
architecture
that
come
before
what
be
different
be
that
we
store
the
application
software
on
the
server
not
the
desktop
client
pc
one
implication
of
run
the
application
on
a
server
be
that
you
no
longer
need
a
desktop
pc
to
access
the
application
all
you
need
be
a
simple
device
run
a
standard
internet
browser
now
we
make
our
money
sell
server
software
so
i
want
to
talk
about
the
server
aspect
of
our
new
architecture
but
the
press
wasn
t
interested
in
our
architecture
or
any
other
difficult
to
photograph
concept
they
want
to
see
the
new
simple
device
the
network
computer
the
nc
story
just
explode
beyond
anything
i
imagine
it
take
on
a
life
of
its
own
some
hardware
company
even
start
manufacturing
network
computer
then
people
start
ask
me
how
we
be
go
to
make
money
with
the
network
computer
we
re
not
i
told
them
we
make
money
sell
server
software
as
long
as
the
application
be
on
the
server
i
don
t
care
what
s
on
the
desktop
almost
everyone
now
see
this
network
computer
episode
as
an
example
of
ellison
s
shoot
his
mouth
off
and
get
it
embarrassingly
wrong
when
i
ask
him
whether
he
d
put
much
real
thought
into
it
he
just
laugh
and
make
a
zero
sign
i
point
out
that
i
d
never
see
him
use
a
network
computer
or
for
that
matter
a
mac
well
my
desktop
pc
have
this
big
beautiful
screen
that
plus
the
speed
of
my
network
connection
be
about
all
i
care
about
ninety
percent
of
the
time
i
m
either
in
e
mail
or
on
the
internet
in
other
word
i
use
my
pc
as
if
it
be
a
network
computer
about
ninety
percent
of
the
time
and
when
this
book
be
do
that
will
go
to
ninety
nine
percent
of
the
time
right
now
i
m
spending
more
time
in
word
than
i
d
like
plus
i
still
read
the
occasional
powerpoint
file
or
excel
spreadsheet
that
s
a
complete
list
of
what
i
do
on
my
pc
as
for
the
network
computer
i
don
t
care
about
it
at
all
why
should
i
it
make
no
difference
to
me
what
computer
people
have
on
their
desk
a
network
computer
a
mac
or
a
pc
just
so
long
as
their
share
application
be
on
oracle
s
application
server
and
all
their
data
be
in
oracle

the
only

all
your

all

you

never

any

that
isn
t
also
store
in
a

unless
you
don
t
mind
lose
it
everyone
s
adopt
the
internet
server
architecture
or
at
least
say
they
be
look
at
peoplesoft
s
new
version
one
hundred
percent
of
the
user
interface
be
via
an

browser
and
all
the
application
be
on
a
server
siebel
s
not
there
yet
but
they
say
they
be
which
mean
that
they
know
they
should
be
they
just
haven
t
gotten
the
program
do
yet
but
tom
know
what
s
hot
so
that
s
what
he
sell
anyway
the
debate
s
over
the
internet
compute
architecture
have
won
the
client
server
architecture
be
dead
i
put
it
to
ellison
that
although
the
war
have
unquestionably
be
largely
on
the
architectural
front
he
have
be
wrong
about
two
thing
the
ability
of
the
pc
industry
through
its
extraordinary
volume
efficiency
to
turn
out
full
feature
box
for
little
more
than
the
price
of
a
strip
down
network
computer
and
the
reluctance
of
people
to
give
up
have
their
personal
productivity
software
run
on
their
local
hard
drive
ellison
s
response
be
that
he
hadn
t
be
alone
in
underestimate
how
the
price
of
pc
would
fall
he
recall
a
conversation
with
intel
s
andy
grove
in
my
idea
for
a
network
computer
have
be
heavily
ridicule
in
intel
s
internal
magazine
they
ran
a
mock
ad
show
larry
ellison
s
magic
box
it
be
an
orange
crate
contain
two
tin
can
connect
by
a
string
andy
grove
intel
s
ceo
carefully
explain
to
me
that
people
want
more
powerful
pc
and
they
be
willing
to
pay
for
them
he
say
that
pc
would
keep
get
more
powerful
and
their
sell
price
would
stay
about
the
same
around
for
the
foreseeable
future
pc
would
keep
get
well
but
not
cheaper
he
compare
my
cheap
nc
to
an
inexpensive
but
unpopular
car
call
the
yugo
i
can
still
see
andy
disdainfully
spit
the
word
yugo
at
me
as
i
respond
back
with
my
most
adolescent
smirk
fine
i
thought
a
nc
will
compete
quite
well
with
a
pc
unfortunately
for
both
grove
and
ellison
the
foreseeable
future
didn
t
last
very
long
a
variety
of
competitive
pressure
force
pc
price
to
drop
to
around
ellison
say
that
pc
surprised
the
hell
out
of
intel
kill
the
nc
and
make
me
look
stupid
but
it
didn
t
cost
me
any
money
oracle
s
server
software
business
be
unaffected
however
for
the
pc
hardware
company
it
be
an
extinction
level
event
most
of
them
saw
their
margin
drop
their
profit
disappear
and
their
life
expectancy
shorten
to
that
of
a
fruit
fly
the
implication
be
that
if
even
andy
grove
one
of
the
founder
of
the
pc
industry
hadn
t
foreseen
machine
with
ten
time
the
performance
of
high
end
pc
of
only
a
few
year
ago
why
should
ellison
an
enterprise
software
guy
have
read
it
any
well
as
for
microsoft
s
office
ellison
concedes
microsoft
s
real
stranglehold
monopoly
have
turn
out
to
be
office
not
window
like
everyone
else
i
could
easily
move
to
desktop
linux
if
microsoft
office
ran
on
linux
but
it
doesn
t
microsoft
maintains
their
desktop
monopoly
with
office
window
isn
t
nearly
as
important
one
of
the
thing
that
make
bill
gate
so
livid
about
the
government
s
antitrust
case
be
the
active
support
it
receive
from
powerful
commercial
rival
such
as
oracle
and
sun
which
he
consider
to
be
no
less
ruthless
in
the
way
they
compete
than
microsoft
in
june
it
emerge
in
the
press
that
oracle
be
employ
private
detective
to
root
through
microsoft
s
garbage
for
evidence
that
apparently
independent
but
pro
microsoft
institute
with
name
such
as
american
for
technology
leadership
and
association
for
competitive
technology
be
just
front
organization
set
up
and
entirely
fund
by
microsoft
ellison
s
so
call
dumpster
dive
hit
the
headline
when
oracle
pass
the
information
it
have
gather
to
the
newspaper
later
the
same
week
ray

over
his
inappropriate
behavior
far
from

he
still

good
about

it
s
important
that
america
s
technology
be
competitive
absolutely
but
i
don
t
think
we
stay
competitive
by
kill
off
innovative
company
like
netscape
and
realnetworks
which
be
microsoft
s
modus
operandi
so
why
be
they
warn
all
patriotic
citizen
that
anything
that
hurt
microsoft
would
hurt
america
it
be
all
part
of
bill
s
big
lie
whatever
s
good
for
microsoft
be
good
for
america
microsoft
s
freedom
to
innovate
must
be
protect
what
i
think
bill
must
be
some
kind
of
reincarnation
of
milo
minderbinder
from
catch
microsoft
be
bankrolling
all
these
bogus
operation
such
as
the
independent
institute
which
be
neither
independent
nor
an
institute
but
we
have
to
find
proof
that
microsoft
be
pay
them
off
to
parrot
the
microsoft
party
line
so
we
found
a
bunch
of
invoice
and
cancel
check
in
the
garbage
prove
microsoft
be
pay
all
these
phony
front
organization
why
should
i
be
embarrass
about
that
we
didn
t
break
the
law
they
do
back
in
late
when
netscape
the
target
of
microsoft
s
aggression
be
already
on
the
rope
and
the
department
of
justice
have
begin
to
take
action
against
microsoft
i
have
ask
ellison
whether
oracle
might
buy
netscape
if
netscape
be
so
important
surely
it
be
in
oracle
s
or
sun
s
interest
to
offer
it
protection
ellison
s
answer
then
have
be
that
netscape
didn
t
have
any
technology
that
oracle
want
his
cat
could
write
a
browser
that
it
be
terribly
overvalue
and
that
anyway
microsoft
be
go
to
kill
it
i
come
away
with
the
impression
that
perhaps
netscape
be
more
valuable
to
oracle
as
a
very
public
victim
than
as
a
go
concern
even
now
it
s
hard
to
gauge
ellison
s
real
feeling
about
netscape
netscape
be
the
most
innovative
silicon
valley
start
up
during
the
ninety
netscape
s
navigator
browser
ushered
in
the
internet
age
they
single
handedly
change
the
valley
ebay
yahoo
and
all
the
other
internet
company
exist
because
of
netscape
but
netscape
have
a
big
problem
it
s
just
not
very
hard
to
write
a
browser
andreessen
write
mosaic
the
mosaic
browser
be
the
precursor
of
navigator
in
his
spare
time
when
he
be
in
college
so
there
be
no
technical
barrier
prevent
microsoft
from
write
a
compete
browser
to
emphasize
that
point
i
say
that
my
cat
the
one
that
recently
die
could
write
a
browser
for
some
reason
that
make
jim
barksdale
netscape
s
ceo
and
marc
very
angry
at
me
i
don
t
know
why
she
be
a
very
smart
cat
the
two
cat
i
have
left
incidentally
can
t
program
worth
a
damn
okay
i
accept
that
most
people
don
t
believe
that
a
cat
even
a
smart
one
can
write
a
browser
all
by
herself
anyway
reasonable
people
can
disagree
but
there
s
no
question
that
a
team
of
competent
programmer
can
build
a
pretty
darn
good
browser
in
about
a
year
and
that
s
exactly
what
microsoft
do
when
they
bundle
it
with
window
for
free
netscape
s
day
be
numbered
they
be
just
this
little
itty
bitty
company
just
a
few
kid
and
jim
barksdale
in
a
fight
to
the
death
with
microsoft
for
god
s
sake
they
have
no
chance
at
all
bill
like
to
say
and
i
quote
if
microsoft
give
away
all
of
its
internet
software
and
netscape
give
away
all
of
its
internet
software
i
like
microsoft
s
chance
of
survival
well
than
netscape
s
yeah
no
kid
the
most
powerful
company
on
earth
have
decide
to
kill
off
a
little
newborn
company
call
netscape
no
hold
bar
it
be
godzilla
versus
bambi
and
godzilla
didn
t
bother
to
play
by
the
rule
on
the
question
of
whether
oracle
should
have
bought
netscape
ellison
repeat
that
under
the
circumstance
the
company
have
be
horribly
overvalue
there
be
this
big
netscape
acquisition
meeting
at
oracle
shortly
before
they
sell
out
to
aol
john
doerr
jim
barksdale
and
marc
andreessen
represent
netscape
the
gap
between
what
they
thought
netscape
be
worth
and
what
i
thought
netscape
be
worth
be
gigantic
they
thought
they
be
the
heartbeat
of
silicon
valley
i
thought
they
be
a
corpse
on
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
they
want
five
to
ten
billion
for
the
company
i
thought
that
netscape
be
near
worthless
they
be
a
money
lose
proposition
and
i
couldn
t
figure
out
what
we
could
have
do
to
save
them
if
we
have
immediately
open
source
the
navigator
browser
then
browser
revenue
would
have
instantly
go
to
zero
what
s
the
point
of
that
we
would
have
paid
billion
for
nothing
some
people
at
oracle
didn
t
agree
they
thought
that
we
should
buy
netscape
just
to
make
certain
that
microsoft
wouldn
t
have
the
only
browser
in
the
market
but
i
really
didn
t
feel
like
pay
a
billion
entry
fee
into
a
one
side
browser
war
it
s
a
colossal
mistake
for
us
to
battle
with
microsoft
over
desktop
software
for
one
very
simple
reason
desktop
software
will
not
determine
the
ultimate
winner
of
the
software
war
it
s
not
a
desktop
browser
war
it
s
a
server
software
war
i
don
t
think
that
we
can
beat
microsoft
on
the
desktop
and
i
don
t
care
we
re
a
server
software
company
the
internet
be
all
about
network
server
software
oracle
be
cbs
and
microsoft
be
sony
we
run
the
network
they
make
television
set
we
make
much
well
server
software
than
microsoft
server
software
be
a
battlefield
where
we
can
fight
them
and
beat
them
we
do
it
every
day
let
them
have
the
desktop
they
can
build
all
the
television
set
they
want
ellison
think
that
the
sheer
distraction
of
destroy
netscape
and
deal
with
legal
consequence
damage
microsoft
more
than
be
generally
realize
he
s
fond
of
say
that
microsoft
robbed
the
wrong
bank
he
say
microsoft
waste
a
tremendous
amount
of
moral
capital
credibility
and
time
destroy
netscape
at
oracle
we
use
to
call
netscape
the
heat
shield
microsoft
be
so
busy
burning
netscape
to
a
crisp
that
they
fell
far
and
far
behind
in
database
technology
we
have
a
big
lead
in
server
software
and
i
don
t
think
that
they
can
catch
us
unlike
netscape
we
re
protect
by
a
huge
almost
insurmountable
technology
barrier
i
couldn
t
help
feel
that
there
be
at
least
a
whiff
of
the
hypocrisy
that
ellison
detests
in
the
tear
jerking
way
that
he
talk
about
the
crush
of
poor
little
netscape
while
he
seem
quite
happy
to
try
to
snuff
the
life
out
of
small
competitor
such
as
ariba
and
commerce
one
which
he
deride
as
feature
rather
than
software
company
it
s
a
charge
that
nettle
ellison
we
ve
never
see
anyone
compete
like
microsoft
nobody
microsoft
very
effectively
and
illegally
threaten
and
bully
pc
company
that
dare
to
distribute
netscape
s
browser
all
the
pc
company
stop
distribute
netscape
because
they
be
afraid
of
microsoft
s
reprisal
microsoft
will
go
on
break
the
law
until
someone
stop
them
they
re
go
after
real
use
the
same
exact
bundling
technique
they
use
against
netscape
they
re
bundling
instant
message
to
go
after
aol
that
s
how
they
compete
bundle
bundle
bundle
why
not
from
their
point
of
view
they
re
get
away
with
it
i
ve
never
see
anything
like
this
degree
of
abuse
of
monopoly
power
ibm
use
to
have
a
monopoly
but
they
never
engage
in
the
kind
of
behavior
that
s
business
as
usual
at
microsoft
okay
but
if
oracle
bundle
its
application
server
with
its
database
which
be
pretty
much
the
case
and
go
to
war
with
bea
which
a
lot
of
people
see
as
an
innovative
company
that
have
create
a
new
market
what
s
the
difference
between
what
oracle
s
do
and
microsoft
first
we
don
t
bundle
our
application
server
with
our
database
we
charge
separately
for
our
application
server
second
even
if
we
do
bundle
our
application
server
with
the
database
we
wouldn
t
be
break
the
law
because
we
don
t
have
a
monopoly
in
database
under
the
provision
of
the
sherman
anti
trust
act
standard
of
behavior
be
different
if
you
have
a
monopoly
versus
not
have
a
monopoly
the
law
say
you
can
t
use
one
monopoly
to
obtain
another
monopoly
microsoft
have
a
monopoly
in
desktop
operating
system
microsoft
bundle
its
browser
in
their
desktop
operating
system
and
they
succeed
in
get
a
monopoly
in
browser
that
s
express
violation
of
our
antitrust
law
now
microsoft
be
bundling
a
medium
player
in
its
desktop
operating
system
to
get
a
monopoly
in
those
microsoft
be
bundling
instant
message
see
any
pattern
here
we
have
no
monopoly
we
don
t
bundle
we
don
t
break
the
law
i
wonder
whether
oracle
if
it
ever
do
get
monopoly
power
would
behave
more
like
intel
than
microsoft
when
andy
grove
first
realize
intel
be
on
its
way
to
have
a
dominant
market
share
in
pc
processor
he
make
certain
that
everybody
at
intel
who
dealt
with
the
world
outside
understood
exactly
what
the
limit
on
their
behavior
should
be
it
didn
t
stop
intel
act
at
time
in
a
fairly
brutal
way
toward
competitor
but
it
have
always
accepted
that
the
law
be
there
and
that
it
apply
to
intel
ellison
laugh
i
think
that
obey
the
law
s
a
really
good
idea
ibm
and
intel
manage
their
monopoly
and
compete
aggressively
without
ever
operating
outside
the
law
but
microsoft
be
different
they
understood
the
law
they
have
lawyer
advise
them
they
re
smart
guy
they
re
not
naive
but
bill
s
an
ideologue
i
think
he
believe
that
the
antitrust
law
be
wrong
so
he
doesn
t
need
to
obey
them
i
have
often
thought
that
one
of
the
reason
for
gate
s
apparent
willingness
to
flout
the
antitrust
law
time
and
again
be
simply
the
arrogance
and
sense
of
inviolability
that
come
from
unimaginable
wealth
if
anyone
have
a
take
on
that
it
should
be
ellison
his
answer
be
complicate
bill
s
hyperrational
side
be
in
a
lose
battle
with
his
emotionally
fragile
side
bill
go
out
and
methodically
search
for
good
idea
to
steal
that
s
perfectly
rational
behavior
that
s
make
him
very
successful
but
then
one
by
one
bill
start
to
claim
credit
for
the
steal
idea
he
actually
start
believe
that
they
really
be
his
idea
in
the
first
place
he
s
pretend
to
be
someone
else
he
want
to
be
someone
else
he
can
t
bear
to
see
himself
as
rockefeller
he
see
himself
as
edison
and
he
can
get
very
childish
and
upset
when
other
people
don
t
see
him
as
the
great
inventor
he
tell
a
story
of
a
dinner
party
at
andy
grove
s
house
during
which
grove
be
ask
whom
he
admire
most
in
the
pc
industry
grove
reply
that
it
have
to
be
steve
job
he
have
either
invent
or
popularize
everything
to
do
with
the
pc
industry
news
of
this
eventually
reach
gate
who
call
grove
and
ask
him
to
dinner
when
the
meal
be
nearly
over
gate
finally
let
it
all
out
his
feeling
have
be
terribly
hurt
doesn
t
andy
admire
bill
ellison
say
here
s
this
guy
who
built
the
most
successful
company
on
earth
but
he
s
still
very
unhappy
with
himself
he
s
unhappy
with
how
he
s
perceive
not
just
by
the
public
but
by
the
people
who
be
close
to
him
his
primary
partner
the
guy
who
ran
intel
his
behavior
during
the
antitrust
trial
wasn
t
so
much
recklessness
come
from
extreme
wealth
as
self
destructiveness
because
he
felt
persecute
and
unappreciated
bill
just
want
to
be
love
who
doesn
t
but
historically
america
have
never
offer
great
love
to
people
who
accumulate
vast
fortune
just
the
opposite
if
you
re
rich
the
best
you
can
hope
for
be
to
make
the
transition
from
robber
baron
to
philanthropist
with
a
great
deal
of
humility
and
a
lot
of
check
write
fair
enough
that
s
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
time
honor
bargain
what
else
can
you
do
with
all
that
money
anyway
you
can
t
spend
it
so
you
have
to
give
it
away
america
hasn
t
yet
offer
great
love
to
bill
gate
at
least
inasmuch
as
he
be
now
see
by
most
people
as
a
latter
day
rockefeller
a
ruthless
bully
rather
than
the
benignly
grin
and
blinking
supergeek
who
built
america
s
most
admire
company
the
government
have
be
successful
beyond
all
expectation
in
make
its
case
against
microsoft
thanks
to
the
courage
of
many
witness
the
courtroom
skill
of
david
boy
and
microsoft
s
own
almost
cavalier
self
incrimination
through
both
the
testimony
of
its
executive
and
the
damn
trail
of
e
mail
one
consequence
of
the
trial
i
reckon
be
that
the
hardware
maker
have
become
braver
about
not
be
use
as
microsoft
s
pawn
and
there
be
great
opportunity
for
oracle
to
forge
strategic
partnership
with
the
like
of
compaq
before
it
be
absorbed
by
hp
and
intel
as
it
be
now
do
ellison
agree
up
to
a
point
do
you
remember
when
microsoft
invite
all
those
people
to
new
york
to
get
up
onstage
with
bill
and
say
how
much
they
like
him
and
how
much
they
like
work
with
microsoft
it
remind
me
of
al
capone
do
a
similar
thing
in
chicago
back
in
the
thirty
it
s
the
be
nice
to
the
alligator
and
maybe
he
ll
eat
you
last
theory
of
survival
well
i
ve
get
a
well
idea
let
s
kill
the
fuck
alligator
before
he
kill
us
if
we
fight
back
maybe
we
ll
survive
maybe
we
won
t
kill
the
alligator
it
s
a
huge
fuck
alligator
but
try
to
kill
it
will
improve
our
chance
for
survival
be
nice
to
this
alligator
will
never
work
if
you
think
microsoft
s
competitor
dislike
them
you
should
talk
to
their
partner
microsoft
have
bully
intel
and
compaq
so
many
time
they
ve
lose
count
everyone
in
the
industry
be
look
for
an
alternative
supplier
of
software
for
intel
s
mass
market
computer
everyone
s
thrill
about
linux
and
i
believe
they
re
look
to
oracle
to
provide
some
balance
against
microsoft
ibm
s
really
not
a
big
player
in
the
software
business
except
on
mainframe
so
it
s
up
to
us
we
re
the
last
best
hope
for
mankind
in
the
battle
against
microsoft
and
its
plan
for
world
domination
to
that
end
ellison
be
devise
a
strategy
for
oracle
to
go
into
the
operating
system
business
he
believe
that
despite
the
hype
over
linux
and
ibm
s
enthusiasm
for
the
open
source
operating
system
it
would
still
be
year
before
it
be
sufficiently
harden
to
do
service
in
the
corporate
data
center
for
that
reason
he
be
in
discussion
with
compaq
s
bos
michael
capella
an
ex
oracle
hand
to
rework
and
eventually
take
over
the
immensely
fast
and
robust
tru
operating
system
which
have
be
developed
over
more
than
two
decade
by
the
best
engineer
at
digital
so
that
it
would
run
on
intel
s
new
bit
processor
ellison
eventually
want
to
see
all
the
intel
base
computer
maker
sell
certify
server
preinstalled
with
tru
and
oracle
s
database
software
it
would
mean
that
oracle
would
have
preintegrated
every
part
of
the
software
stack
from
the
application
at
the
top
of
the
stack
through
the
application
server
to
the
database
and
finally
the
operating
system
at
the
bottom
we
re
go
to
build
our
next
generation
of
database
cluster
out
of
a
bunch
of
low
cost
intel
computer
our
intel
cluster
will
be
highly
secure
totally
fault
tolerant
and
much
faster
and
cheaper
than
anything
else
on
the
block
as
for
the
operating
system
don
t
ask
don
t
tell
you
don
t
ask
what
operating
system
a
cisco
router
be
run
why
should
anyone
care
what
operating
system
our
database
cluster
be
run
it
seem
that
regardless
of
the
final
outcome
of
the
microsoft
case
oracle
have
already
benefit
from
it
even
if
microsoft
emerge
constrain
by
only
mild
conduct
remedy
ellison
seem
to
think
that
oracle
could
withstand
any
vengeance
that
gate
might
want
to
exact
rather
than
oracle
be
on
the
fire
line
ellison
believe
that
the
company
that
have
most
to
fear
be
in
the
consumer
and
entertainment
business
in
particular
he
thought
that
aol
time
warner
and
sony
be
about
to
feel
the
full
effect
of
compete
with
microsoft
ellison
frown
i
think
aol
be
in
deep
trouble
but
what
do
i
know
i
really
don
t
understand
aol
s
business
at
all
to
me
it
seem
like
a
simple
online
service
for
people
who
don
t
like
computer
whenever
i
prowl
around
their
system
all
i
can
find
be
a
bunch
of
twelve
to
fourteen
year
old
in
chat
room
chat
room
be
closely
related
to
instant
message
both
have
be
critical
to
aol
hold
on
to
their
customer
aol
chat
and
instant
message
be
a
close
network
they
only
allow
you
to
communicate
with
other
aol
member
that
strategy
work
fine
for
a
while
but
it
will
fall
apart
over
time
imagine
an
e
mail
system
that
only
let
you
e
mail
other
aol
member
no
one
would
use
it
as
instant
message
matures
into
a
standard
service
aol
must
open
their
system
up
or
be
isolated
from
all
the
other
instant
message
user
in
the
world
aol
have
no
good
choice
here
either
way
they
lose
microsoft
be
bundling
instant
message
with
the
next
version
of
window
instant
message
will
soon
become
a
standard
service
in
business
there
will
be
more
instant
message
user
outside
aol
than
inside
aol
it
s
not
a
pretty
picture
to
make
matter
bad
microsoft
can
underprice
aol
whenever
they
feel
the
government
heat
be
off
what
if
microsoft
price
msn
at
half
the
cost
of
aol
for
the
next
ten
year
or
so
then
there
s
the
small
issue
of
the
upcoming
competition
from
the
broadband
carrier
the
phone
and
cable
company
maybe
they
ll
squeeze
out
both
aol
and
msn
who
know
all
you
really
need
be
a
fast
line
from
a
carrier
and
yahoo
why
should
the
broadband
carrier
share
any
money
with
microsoft
or
aol
aol
have
a
very
uncertain
future
steve
case
pull
off
the
deal
of
the
century
by
buying
time
warner
aol
shareholder
should
give
him
a
medal
on
the
other
hand
time
warner
shareholder
have
a
right
to
be
very
very
upset
and
i
think
they
ll
get
more
upset
over
time
what
be
gerry
levin
think
x
box
microsoft
s
game
console
be
likely
to
get
kill
by
sony
s
playstation
for
the
next
couple
of
christmas
however
microsoft
have
great
patience
and
endurance
they
ll
be
around
year
after
year
microsoft
s
monopoly
generate
so
much
cash
that
they
can
blow
billion
in
the
game
business
and
keep
come
at
you
that
s
what
sony
face
perhaps
microsoft
won
t
kill
sony
s
game
machine
business
but
they
ll
be
sony
s
number
one
competitor
and
as
game
go
online
with
broadband
microsoft
be
likely
to
start
building
game
that
work
with
both
pc
and
the
x
box
the
online
game
business
be
brand
new
and
that
present
opportunity
to
a
newcomer
like
microsoft
sony
s
a
great
company
but
microsoft
have
unlimited
financial
resource
it
s
no
fun
compete
with
a
company
that
have
an
infinite
amount
of
monopoly
money
real
monopoly
real
money
so
i
think
aol
and
sony
be
both
vulnerable
to
competition
from
microsoft
the
barrier
to
entry
into
their
business
be
primarily
financial
not
technical
fortunately
the
opposite
be
true
for
us
the
reason
we
re
able
to
compete
with
microsoft
be
because
our
technology
be
so
hard
to
replicate
it
take
us
more
than
twenty
year
to
build
our
database
and
our
guy
be
every
bit
as
smart
as
theirs
sometimes
i
think
that
we
ll
be
their
last
competitor
the
last
one
stand
hat
and
baiting
microsoft
software
s
evil
empire
be
one
thing
but
i
wonder
whether
ellison
could
really
get
himself
so
work
up
about
ibm
a
company
he
have
admire
all
his
life
and
be
even
now
ready
to
call
a
national
treasure
well
there
be
two
different
ibms
the
ibm
of
christmas
past
and
the
ibm
of
christmas
present
the
old
ibm
the
real
ibm
be
create
by
thomas
watson
jr
that
ibm
be
the
great
company
in
the
history
of
the
earth
when
i
grow
up
in
this
industry
ibm
wasn
t
someone
against
whom
you
compete
ibm
be
the
environment
in
which
you
compete
but
that
be
then
and
this
be
now
ibm
never
really
recover
from
the
loss
of
tom
watson
he
be
follow
by
a
string
of
anonymous
sale
executive
who
just
kept
do
what
ibm
have
always
do
develop
and
sell
mainframe
hardware
and
software
as
the
center
of
gravity
of
the
computer
industry
move
away
from
mainframe
ibm
fail
to
adapt
the
world
change
the
industry
change
but
ibm
didn
t
eventually
ibm
be
force
to
hire
an
outsider
lou
gerstner
to
come
in
and
change
the
company
he
abandon
ibm
s
technology
centric
past
for
a
service
centric
future
ibm
hasn
t
developed
any
interest
software
since
the
mainframe
version
of
db
nearly
twenty
year
ago
that
s
a
long
dry
spell
all
of
their
great
software
be
their
old
mainframe
stuff
o
vm
the
mainframe
version
of
db
all
first
rate
piece
of
technology
the
new
ibm
no
longer
develops
much
software
instead
they
go
out
and
buy
it
they
bought
lotus
tivoli
informix
rational
and
so
on
ibm
s
product
on
unix
and
window
be
not
close
to
be
competitive
their
database
on
unix
and
window
use
to
be
call
udb
universal
database
but
they
change
the
name
to
db
to
try
to
fool
people
into
think
it
be
the
same
database
product
that
they
have
on
mainframe
now
db
on
mainframe
be
a
great
product
db
on
unix
and
window
be
a
totally
different
product
with
a
totally
different
architecture
and
it
s
a
very
distant
third
in
the
modern
database
business
behind
oracle
and
microsoft
s
sql
server
lou
gerstner
turn
ibm
into
a
giant
service
organization
you
have
money
we
have
people
want
to
trade
there
be
very
little
leverage
in
that
it
s
really
just
a
big
version
of
ed
a
big
system
integrator
and
host
firm
found
by
ross
perot
but
i
don
t
think
building
lot
of
oil
and
lube
place
to
service
your
car
be
a
very
good
idea
what
if
someone
build
a
car
that
only
require
the
oil
to
be
change
every
mile
ibm
s
service
business
model
depends
on
computer
technology
remain
very
complex
and
labor
intensive
ibm
ran
this
series
of
ad
show
a
roomful
of
business
executive
say
good
grief
if
this
merger
go
through
we
ll
have
seven
different
platform
fifteen
different
database
fourteen
different
operating
system
a
wireless
project
and
so
on
then
you
hear
this
woman
s
voice
speak
to
the
roomful
of
desperate
exec
and
the
voice
say
and
that
s
when
you
know
it
s
time
for
ibm
in
other
word
compute
be
so
enormously
complicate
that
a
normal
business
can
t
hope
to
understand
or
cope
with
it
so
you
should
call
in
ibm
i
have
a
different
idea
use
well
technology
that
s
easy
to
understand
our
strategy
be
to
simplify
our
software
so
you
need
less
labor
to
install
and
run
it
you
don
t
need
a
big
system
integrator
if
you
don
t
do
much
system
integration
ibm
recommends
that
you
buy
lot
of
different
application
from
lot
of
different
vendor
in
fact
ibm
resells
application
from
sap
siebel
i
ariba
pretty
much
everyone
i
can
think
of
except
oracle
then
ibm
make
a
bundle
by
sell
you
guy
with
glue
gun
to
stick
it
all
together
the
old
ibm
s
strategy
be
create
value
by
create
intellectual
property
the
new
ibm
s
strategy
be
base
on
service
complex
system
the
more
complex
the
system
the
well
it
be
for
ibm
but
if
i
m
right
and
the
industry
turn
away
from
these
labor
intensive
highly
customize
best
of
breed
software
system
then
ibm
s
service
business
will
slowly
melt
away
like
a
glacier
the
essence
of
ellison
s
hostility
toward
ibm
be
a
form
of
intellectual
snobbery
a
company
that
be
make
great
by
its
technology
and
apply
engineering
skill
have
lose
its
way
and
sell
out
it
be
now
run
by
sale
and
marketing
guy
who
be
cynically
sell
out
the
great
name
in
american
business
for
the
pragmatic
gerstner
remake
ibm
as
the
solution
provider
with
the
deepest
bench
as
his
successor
sam
palmisano
once
described
it
to
me
have
be
a
triumphant
success
but
it
s
easy
to
understand
why
ellison
see
the
shift
not
only
as
an
exploitable
point
of
difference
with
oracle
s
main
competitor
in
the
database
market
and
the
aggressive
reseller
of
its
rival
application
but
also
as
a
kind
of
betrayal
what
most
riles
him
however
be
the
cavalier
approach
to
fact
that
big
blue
routinely
adopts
in
its
marketing
ibm
go
on
the
attack
about
six
month
ago
they
sent
out
a
bunch
of
letter
to
cio
claim
that
they
be
number
one
in
database
market
share
and
number
one
in
database
performance
well
they
be
number
one
in
mainframe
database
market
share
but
on
unix
linux
and
window
we
have
five
time
the
market
share
they
have
ton
of
survey
morgan
stanley
goldman
sachs
support
that
as
for
be
number
one
in
performance
well
i
m
stun
that
ibm
would
make
such
a
completely
indefensible
and
easily
disprovable
claim
the
old
ibm
would
never
ever
have
do
that
although
oracle
s
big
philosophical
battle
with
ibm
be
about
complexity
the
integrate
oracle
suite
versus
the
best
of
breed
application
recommend
by
ibm
and
expensively
glue
together
by
big
blue
s
army
of
integrator
ellison
have
decide
that
the
first
stage
of
the
campaign
against
ibm
will
be
to
go
after
their
software
technology
product
because
their
software
technology
isn
t
what
it
use
to
be
and
it
s
not
just
ibm
s
database
that
s
in
the
fire
line
but
also
its
application
server
ibm
s
get
this
thing
call
websphere
websphere
be
not
a
product
it
s
many
product
around
a
hundred
separate
product
i
believe
it
s
a
bit
confuse
ibm
have
gotten
into
this
odd
habit
of
use
the
same
name
for
totally
different
thing
db
be
one
name
but
ibm
applies
it
to
two
totally
different
product
the
confusion
be
intentional
the
websphere
name
take
the
confusion
to
a
new
level
websphere
include
a
hundred
different
product
it
s
the
same
name
scheme
that
george
foreman
us
to
name
his
kid
they
re
all
name
george
anyway
one
of
the
product
that
fall
under
the
umbrella
name
of
websphere
be
ibm
s
java
system
in
a
fit
of
creative
license
ibm
put
a
statement
on
their
web
site
claim
that
ibm
s
application
server
websphere
run
java
twice
as
fast
as
bea
s
application
server
they
didn
t
publish
their
benchmark
result
but
they
do
put
a
copy
of
the
benchmark
program
on
their
web
site
now
we
be
ready
to
take
ibm
at
their
word
because
after
all
they
re
ibm
they
wouldn
t
just
make
this
stuff
up
we
have
already
test
bea
s
application
server
and
found
that
our
java
be
twice
as
fast
as
bea
s
java
so
we
figure
that
we
must
be
around
the
same
speed
as
ibm
s
java
that
be
a
little
disappoint
but
those
seem
to
be
the
fact
but
the
night
before
we
be
schedule
to
make
our
big
java
announcement
i
ask
richard
sarwal
the
guy
in
charge
of
our
server
performance
group
to
download
the
performance
test
on
ibm
s
web
site
and
test
ibm
s
java
richard
look
extremely
depressed
it
take
him
twelve
hour
to
download
everything
he
need
but
he
finally
get
the
test
run
when
i
come
in
the
follow
day
i
found
out
that
ibm
be
not
twice
as
fast
as
bea
bea
be
twice
as
fast
as
ibm
ibm
just
confuse
the
subject
with
the
predicate
that
s
a
pretty
serious
typo
after
we
complete
all
our
test
our
java
end
up
run
twice
as
fast
as
bea
and
four
time
as
fast
as
ibm
i
don
t
know
how
ibm
get
away
with
make
claim
that
be
so
easily
disprovable
i
guess
because
they
re
ibm
the
ad
that
oracle
have
start
run
against
ibm
be
as
aggressive
as
anything
it
have
do
during
the
s
when
it
be
just
a
scrappy
upstart
i
wonder
whether
a
self
confident
mature
company
should
feel
it
necessary
to
define
itself
by
trash
its
competitor
wasn
t
there
something
undignified
about
it
ellison
grin
i
know
it
s
bad
manner
to
publicly
point
to
your
competitor
and
say
nyah
nyah
nyah
we
re
well
than
you
i
know
this
style
make
people
think
i
m
a
rude
jerk
so
be
it
but
i
don
t
know
any
other
way
to
prove
the
superiority
of
our
technology
without
directly
compare
it
to
our
competitor
technology
we
urgently
need
to
make
our
point
there
s
no
polite
way
to
point
out
that
what
ibm
s
say
be
not
true
we
present
verifiable
fact
as
clearly
as
we
can
and
then
we
ask
the
market
to
decide
here
s
us
here
s
them
here
s
the
proof
you
decide
another
part
of
the
logic
in
go
for
ibm
as
ellison
see
it
be
that
many
of
oracle
s
other
rival
march
under
big
blue
s
banner
company
ellison
describes
as
ibm
s
vassal
he
say
a
lot
of
siebel
s
success
be
due
to
the
fact
that
ibm
recommends
siebel
it
cost
you
million
for
siebel
and
another
million
for
ibm
to
put
it
in
for
you
ibm
say
we
ve
look
at
oracle
we
ve
look
at
siebel
and
we
really
think
you
should
buy
siebel
ibm
be
the
supermarket
for
all
of
our
competitor
they
do
two
thing
first
they
provide
the
skilled
labor
to
install
the
stuff
fair
enough
the
problem
come
with
ibm
s
pretense
of
objectivity
when
they
recommend
application
software
we
re
ibm
we
re
an
independent
agent
we
ve
do
a
careful
and
detailed
analysis
and
we
honestly
think
sap
or
siebel
or
peoplesoft
or
i
or
anyone
be
always
a
much
well
choice
than
oracle
of
course
they
re
go
to
recommend
sap
or
siebel
because
it
cost
five
or
ten
time
more
to
install
and
run
that
stuff
that
s
how
ibm
make
their
money
instal
and
run
the
software
ibm
brings
siebel
i
ariba
commerce
one
and
other
economically
fragile
software
company
brand
credibility
without
ibm
they
d
all
die
even
with
ibm
they
ll
all
die
just
more
slowly
we
compete
with
ibm
directly
in
the
database
and
application
server
business
and
indirectly
in
the
application
business
we
re
beating
ibm
in
the
database
business
and
the
application
server
business
the
only
place
they
do
well
be
on
mainframe
and
mainframe
matter
less
and
less
every
year
time
be
on
our
side
in
the
application
business
it
s
not
ibm
s
to
win
or
lose
that
battle
be
between
best
of
breed
and
the
integrate
suite
if
the
integrate
suite
win
then
ibm
loses
we
ll
win
the
database
and
application
server
war
i
m
confident
of
that
and
the
integrate
suite
will
kill
best
of
breed
i
m
confident
of
that
too
but
we
need
to
beat
sap
in
the
integrate
application
suite
war
that
s
the
hard
one
but
it
s
doable
if
we
win
all
three
battle
and
that
s
a
big
if
then
we
ll
replace
microsoft
as
the
most
important
company
on
earth
but
i
don
t
dream
of
an
oracle
that
s
like

how

be

as

inconceivable
that

the

two
thing
make
me

the

it

most

the
people
who
work
at

be
formidably
intelligent
ellison

constant
probe
and

seem
both
to
put

on
their

ellison
have
told
me
that
he
be
unable
to
strike
a
balance
between
an
extreme
form
of
laissez
faire
delegation
and
an
equally
extreme
obsession
with
influence
every
aspect
of
the
business
he
could
either
be
semidetached
from
the

to
day

of

as
he
have
be
during
the
mid
s
or
furiously
involve
as
he
be
now
although
ellison
s
energy
and
commitment
be
hugely
impressive
and
there
be
hardly
anyone
at
oracle
who
prefer
the
hand
off
ellison
to
the
hand
on
version
i
could
not
help
remember
jeff
henley
s
anxiety
that
perhaps
ellison
be
now
be
too
control
and
that
the
creativity
of
some
very
smart
people
might
fail
to
flower
as
a
consequence
overdependence
on
ellison
carry
other
risk
accord
to
some
people
who
knew
him
there
have
be
a
cycle
in
the
past
in
which
ellison
s
appetite
for
run
oracle
would
wax
and
wane
depend
on
the
challenge
face
the
business
henley
actually
believe
that
in
some
way
the
pound
that
oracle
be
take
in
be
a
stroke
of
luck
because
it
meant
that
ellison
have
no
option
but
to
tie
himself
to
the
job
if
success
with
i
come
too
quickly
there
be
a
danger
that
ellison
might
relax
henley
and
other
oracle
executive
be
also
worried
about
the
commitment
ellison

make
to
win
the
america

when
i
inadvertently
mention
to

that

of
five
month
he
have
be
horrify
at
the
very
least
he
say
it
would
mean
that
some
important
deal
which
only
ellison
could
close
would
be
lose
maybe
forever
he
be
so
upset
that
he
call
ellison
who
be
cruise

on

there

what

that
some
dispute
that
only
larry
can
settle
will
remain
unresolved
i
ask
ellison
how
seriously
he
take
their
misgiving
no
matter
how
much
he
want
to
win
the

seven

and
check
his
overnight

get
more
than

most
of
which
he
answer

forward
to
the

person
he
prefers
short
e
mail
that
deal
with

rather

after

drive
a

for

if
anything
an
even
more
bruising
time
in

so
while
much
of

at
encourage
his

to
buy
into

also
want
to

about
the

it

an

contrast
drexler
who
along
with
ellison
serf
on
the
apple
board
see
everything
through
a
consumer
lens
whereas
ellison
be
more
concerned
about
the
confidence
of
business
customer
to
invest
in
an
uncertain
climate
naturally
both
be
far
too
polite
to
suggest
that
any
internal
factor
could
be

to
their
current

when
the

eventually
tear
themselves
away
from

ellison
express
his
frustration
that
despite
the

the

down

with
the

they

go
to
have
a
hard
time
with
retek
a
retail
software
package
it
s
not
an
easy
package
to
implement
or
integrate
they
need
to

mile
along

at

phone
around
tell

who

ellison
s
arrival
safra
catz
will
push
thing
along
in
the
eleventh
floor
boardroom
but
it
s
slightly
awkward
for
her
a
fact
reflect
by
her
unwillingness
to
sit
center
stage
an
important
part
of
the
way
she
sell
herself
within
oracle
be
that
she
doesn
t
give
the
impression
of
run
the
show
in
his
absence
in
the
way
that
ray
lane
and
to
some
extent
gary
bloom
might
have
do
when
ellison
do
stride
in
the
atmosphere
becomes
highly
charge
it
s
not
that
ellison
s
presence
exactly
make
anyone
nervous
although
a
relatively
junior
executive
wait
to
make
some
careful
powerpoint
presentation
might
disagree
nor
do
people
become
overtly
respectful
there
s
still
plenty
of
tinker
with
palmpilots
and
frequent
visit
to
the
fridge
in
the
hall
to
get
drink
if
ed
screven
be
there
he
ll
be
sprawl
in
his
chair
his
foot
in
decay
run
shoe
plant
on
the
expensive
table
top
it
s
more
that
there
s
an
air
of
expectation
ellison
be
always
in
performance
mode
crack
joke
tell
story
and
generally
dominate
every
part
of
the
discussion
it
s
almost
as
if
he
feel
the
need
to
relegitimize
his
leadership
each
day
by
demonstrate
the
completeness
of
his
grasp
what
s
noticeable
in
these
meeting
which
typically
continue
until
six
or
seven
in
the
even
be
how
differently
ellison
relates
to
the
programmer
compare
with
other
worker
at
oracle
they
know
that
they
be
the
elite
and
a
good
few
of
the
old
hand
be
confident
enough
of
their
stand
with
ellison
to
argue
with
him
if
they
think
he
s
wrong
and
they
have
the
fact
on
their
side
from
that
point
of
view
the
concern
that
an
excessively
control
ellison
may
be
squeeze
the
creativity
out
of
colleague
seem
overdone
although
i
have
be
present
in
a
few
meeting
when
there
s
be
an
air
of
tension
usually
when
it
turn
out
that
somebody
have
fall
down
on
the
job
ellison
no
longer
go
in
for
public
execution
by
his
own
admission
it
s
quite
a
change
from
the
way
he
use
to
operate
and
as
always
with
ellison
it
s
the
reputation
he
earn
in
a
different
era
that
stay
with
him
now

when
ellison
be
fourteen
he
have
an
argument
with
his
sister
doris
then
in
her
early
thirty
she
ask
me
the
question
what
s
more
important
to
you
to
be
love
or
admire
i
say
i
d
like
to
be
admire
she
just
say
no
give
me
her
you
re
just
a
stupid
adolescent
look
and
left
the
room
it
take
me
a
long
time
to
understand
that
we
all
want
to
be
love
even
me
imagine
that
anyway
i
use
to
have
a
management
style
that
earn
neither
love
nor
admiration
rather
than
use
conventional
mbo
management
by
objective
technique
i
invent
my
own
style
of
management

to

just
start
his
own
company
a
popular

that

their

mbr
take
more
time
you
need
to
spend
hour
every
day
in
meeting
with
your
key
senior
people
where
you
point
out
at
length
exactly
why
this

that
person

theory
isn
t
it
i
be
pretty
brutal
in
attack

and
embarrass
people
i
d
excuse
my
behavior
by
tell
myself
i
be
just
have
an
open
and
honest
debate
the
fact
be
i
just
didn
t
know
any
well
all
my
experience
in
business
have
be
as
a
programmer
programmer
routinely
play
a
game
call
who
s
the
smartest
person
in
the
room
it
s
still
a
popular
game
at
oracle
i
see
it
played
all
the
time
when
play
wtspinr
pronounce
wet
spinner
you
get
point
by
show
how
irrational
or
suboptimal
other
people
s
idea
be
it
happens
in
all
discipline
to
some
extent
but
program
be
similar
to
mathematics
in
that
there
be
clear
right
and
wrong
answer
so
there
be
clear
winner
and
loser
it
s
classic
primate
behavior
figure
out
where
you
be
in
the
monkey
troupe
i
thought
that
maybe
ellison
s
use
of
mbr
be
fairly
typical
of
an
insecure
ceo
try
to
establish
his
leadership
he
disagrees
no
in
fact
ceo
be
a
title
that
s
look
down
upon
by
most
programmer
remember
the
name
of
the
game
be
who
s
the
smartest
in
the
room
not
who
s
get
the
most
star
on
their
shoulder
there
s
very
little
respect
for
rank
among
programmer
programmer
have
tremendous
intellectual
integrity
and
you
have
to
be
able
to
clearly
explain
why
something
be
right
or
wrong
if
you
expect
to
win
an
argument
what
be
unnecessary
and
unacceptable
be
to
humiliate
people
in
public
while
you
re
explain
something
people
didn
t
sign
up
for
that
you
know
oh
great
between
ten
and
twelve
i
get
to
go
to
a
meeting
and
be
publicly
humiliate
i
can
t
wait
what
be
it
that
convince
ellison
that
beating
people
up
be
not
always
the
way
of
get
the
best
out
of
them
i
be
in
a
big
meeting
between
oracle
and
another
company
the
other
company
s
ceo
an
absolutely
brilliant
guy
start
attack
idea
and
people
in
a
frighteningly
brutal
and
destructive
way
i
be
an
mbr
amateur
compare
to
this
guy
the
overall
dynamic
in
the
room
instantly
change
everybody
become
afraid
to
talk
because
they
didn
t
want
to
be
intellectually
embarrass
but
it
be
bad
than
that
people
start
to
line
up
against
this
guy
not
because
he
be
wrong
he
wasn
t
but
because
he
be
inhumane
they
grudgingly
accepted
that
he
be
smart
but
that
didn
t
keep
them
from
want
him
to
fail
from
then
on
i
be
very
careful
about
use
mbr
maybe
it
s
okay
for
programmer
but
it
s
certainly
not
okay
for
ceo
it
s
hard
enough
to
run
a
company
you
don
t
want
everyone
root
against
you
ninety
nine
percent
of
the
time
mbr
be
degrade
to
the
practitioner
and
damage
to
the
business
although
ellison
have
learn
from
past
mistake
there
be
still
aspect
of
the
way
he
run
the
company
through
these
quite
large
meeting
that
can
have
some
negative
consequence
ellison
feel
he
have
to
perform
to
demonstrate
his
leadership
and
his
prowess
be
it
possible
to
be
in
both
performance
mode
and
listen
mode
it
make
pick
up
the
nuance
of
a
meeting
more
difficult
and
make
him
all
the
more
dependent
on
a
few
trust
people
safra
catz
above
all
to
tell
him
what
he
may
be
miss
and
some
very
bright
people
who
might
have
important
contribution
to
make
simply
freeze
in
that
kind
of
environment
and
although
ellison
no
longer
practice
mbr
and
now
try
hard
to
encourage
debate
there
probably
still
isn
t
enough
of
it
at
oracle
gary
bloom
say
the
way
larry
us
these
meeting
they
re
a
fine
environment
for
communicate
strategy
and
decision
he
s
already
make
but
it
s
not
a
fine
environment
for
debate
those
decision
once
he
s
make
them
it
s
an
issue
i
raise
with
larry
and
i
think
he
s
be
work
on
try
to
get
people
to
be
more
open
if
they
disagree
with
him
i
once
say
to
him
not
long
after
i
become
a
member
of
the
pdmc
product
development
management
committee
that
i
didn
t
get
what
the
meeting
be
for
be
it
for
you
to
articulate
what
you
want
or
be
it
for
people
to
tell
you
what
you
need
to
hear
he
say
it
s
for
people
to
discus
and
tell
me
what
i
need
to
hear
i
told
him
that
s
not
what
happens
i
say
larry
we
have
separate
discussion
from
you
and
we
might
sometimes
all
be
in
agreement
that
you
re
wrong
about
something
but
as
soon
as
you
violently
disagree
or
get
emotional
everybody
fold
their
card
the
debate
s
over
they
re
unwilling
to
take
you
on
the
very
next
day
in
the
meeting
he
take
up
a
deliberately
controversial
position
on
an
issue
against
me
i
kept
debate
him
and
eventually
he
turn
to
everybody
and
say
you
must
all
agree
with
my
position
because
none
of
you
be
jumping
in
on
gary
s
side
and
they
all
go
oh
actually
we
do
agree
with
gary
but
even
if
he
s
get
well
about
this
a
group
meeting
be
still
not
a
substitute
for
a
one
to
one
interaction
between
a
ceo
and
key
leader
within
the
company
this
be
an
issue
about
which
bloom
feel
especially
strongly
from
the
end
of
for
at
least
two
year
during
the
period
when
ellison
be
slowly
wrest
power
back
from
ray
lane
bloom
be
ellison
s
right
hand
whenever
bloom
want
to
speak
to
ellison
in
private
his
bos
make
the
time
especially
if
bloom
have
uncovered
yet
more
evidence
of
what
they
both
at
the
time
regard
as
lane
s
incompetence
when
the
oracle
board
insist
in
that
there
should
be
a
formal
plan
of
succession
in
place
the
only
internal
candidate
whom
ellison
be
ready
to
endorse
be
bloom
the
top
choice
outside
oracle
be
sun
microsystems
scott
mcnealy
however
within
twelve
month
bloom
be
find
it
difficult
to
get
the
kind
of
access
to
ellison
that
he
have
come
to
expect
in
part
it
be
because
ellison
be
begin
to
think
he
might
have
promote
bloom
a
little
too
fast
and
as
a
consequence
like
lane
before
him
his
ego
be
start
to
outstrip
his
ability
although
ellison
denies
it
i
think
he
be
rile
by
bloom
s
claim
in
fortune
magazine
s
why
oracle
s
cool
again
cover
story
that
he
be
perfectly
capable
of
run
oracle
but
it
be
also
because
of
ellison
s
grow
reliance
on
and
trust
in
safra
catz
although
bloom
and
catz
get
on
well
respect
each
other
and
be
united
in
their
contempt
for
lane
it
become
increasingly
clear
to
bloom
that
he
be
lose
out
to
catz
in
term
of
influence
with
ellison
bloom
say
this
isn
t
a
slam
on
safra
i
like
her
she
s
very
smart
and
she
really
do
understand
what
need
to
be
do
but
what
happen
be
that
larry
out
of
convenience
start
use
her
as
a
path
of
communication
he
felt
it
be
easy
to
tell
something
to
safra
and
then
have
her
go
and
communicate
it
to
everyone
else
include
me
she
become
the
filter
and
the
funnel
through
which
everything
from
larry
come
if
i
have
to
communicate
something
to
my
organization
which
be
about
sixteen
thousand
people
i
need
to
get
that
little
bit
of
background
or
color
directly
from
larry
to
provide
the
context
for
a
decision
i
never
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
a
leader
say
we
re
do
this
because
larry
say
so
it
be
so
damage
to
our
culture
all
i
would
need
be
thirty
second
of
discussion
direct
with
larry
but
when
thing
start
come
through
safra
and
i
couldn
t
get
that
i
couldn
t
effectively
do
my
job
i
m
not
criticize
safra
i
told
larry
this
and
he
say
okay
i
see
your
point
i
ll
try
to
change
but
there
be
never
any
change
it
get
to
a
point
where
i
be
responsible
for
the
vast
majority
of
the
company
yet
i
have
no
contact
with
the
guy
who
actually
ran
the
company
carolyn
balkenhol
confirms
that
ellison
become
increasingly
reluctant
to
see
bloom
as
well
as
be
frustrate
and
personally
wound
bloom
also
calculate
that
ellison
s
new
appetite
for
run
the
company
meant
that
his
own
role
let
alone
his
chance
of
one
day
become
ceo
of
oracle
would
diminish
when
in
november
veritas
then
the
fifth
big
software
company
in
the
world
thanks
in
no
small
measure
to
the
effort
of
geoff
squire
the
man
ellison
most
regret
fire
offer
forty
year
old
bloom
the
top
job
it
wasn
t
a
difficult
decision
although
ellison
be
annoyed
about
bloom
s
departure
partly
because
of
the
bad
impression
it
give
to
investor
come
so
soon
after
ray
lane
s
resignation
that
he
couldn
t
keep
his
senior
executive
happy
he
have
some
sympathy
with
him
i
understand
gary
s
frustration
safra
and
i
share
a
high
bandwidth
communication
link
we
finish
each
other
s
sentence
we
come
to
the
same
conclusion
in
the
same
amount
of
time
we
rarely
disagree
but
when
we
do
she
s
not
shy
about
express
her
opinion
if
she
think
i
m
wrong
she
freeze
me
with
one
of
her
pierce
stare
and
tell
me
i
m
wrong
she
s
not
afraid
of
me
or
any
other
human
anyway
i
can
count
on
her
tell
me
the
truth
as
she
see
it
i
respect
her
and
rely
on
her
as
my
chief
confidante
and
counselor
in
that
respect
she
do
replace
gary
that
be
very
hard
for
gary
to
take
actually
come
to
think
of
it
he
didn
t
take
it
he
left
although
ellison
accepts
that
his
key
directs
should
have
a
right
to
one
on
one
time
with
him
it
s
still
something
that
he
feel
ambivalent
about
it
s
true
i
don
t
like
do
a
lot
of
it
if
it
s
something
personal
then
you
have
to
do
it
one
on
one
but
if
you
re
try
to
decide
a
business
policy
issue
like
pricing
then
i
d
much
rather
have
the
whole
team
there
so
that
everyone
can
weigh
in
that
way
everyone
will
understand
how
we
arrive
at
a
particular
decision
rather
than
have
to
guess
meeting
with
the
senior
management
team
as
a
group
force
us
to
focus
on
the
goal
of
the
company
as
a
whole
rather
than
one
department
at
a
time
look
at
the
gestalt
of
the
business
have
result
in
less
infighting
between
department
and
a
more
open
and
collegial
work
environment

what
s
very
clear
be
how
much
these
day
ellison
lean
on
the
slight
black
haired
black
clad
figure
of
safra
catz
he
say
she
make
up
for
one
of
my
big
area
of
weakness
she
s
discipline
and
thorough
i
m
not
i
m
pretty
good
at
separate
the
good
idea
from
the
bad
idea
and
i
m
pretty
good
at
drilling
into
detail
and
solve
problem
but
once
a
problem
be
understood
once
a
plan
be
in
place
i
usually
move
on
to
the
next
thing
rather
than
follow
up
and
make
sure
that
the
agree
upon
plan
be
actually
implement
it
s
call
execution
and
safra
be
brilliant
at
it
safra
be
so
exceptionally
bright
that
she
keep
all
the
why
and
wherefore
of
all
our
policy
and
plan
in
her
head
that
enables
her
to
make
interpretation
modification
and
improvement
during
the
execution
phase
of
the
plan
without
any
intervention
from
me
now
when
we
decide
on
something
it
actually
get
do
catz
have
always
downplayed
the
extent
of
her
power
and
influence
insist
that
she
have
no
agenda
of
her
own
unlike
by
implication
ray
lane
and
be
there
only
to
make
sure
that
the
thing
that
ellison
want
to
happen
get
do
she
say
i
m
not
interested
in
building
power
and
i
don
t
have
any
individual
power
here
people
will
send
me
thing
for
my
approval
and
my
response
will
always
be
okay
if
it
s
within
the
scope
of
a
decision
i
already
know
larry
have
approve
i
say
that
as
a
reminder
that
i
don
t
have
any
power
of
my
own
it
s
an
impressive
and
genuine
demonstration
of
loyalty
as
well
as
be
clever
it
put
her
out
of
the
fire
line
when
she
s
do
something
that
ruffle
feather
or
bruise
the
ego
of
senior
executive
especially
on
the
sale
side
who
resent
the
degree
of
oversight
and
supervision
she
represent
but
one
of
the
criticism
that
i
sometimes
hear
about
catz
both
within
oracle
and
outside
be
that
unlike
other
manager
she
be
not
really
accountable
an
impression
that
s
strengthen
by
her
reluctance
to
become
a
public
face
in
the
way
that
ray
lane
and
to
a
lesser
extent
gary
bloom
do
ellison
say
she
s
accountable
to
me
and
to
the
board
together
with
jeff
henley
we
re
collectively
accountable
for
the
performance
of
the
company
if
we
re
not
do
a
good
job
it
will
show
up
in
the
number
i
understand
her
desire
to
stay
in
the
background
but
that
s
go
to
be
very
hard
to
do
over
the
long
term
she
s
gradually
become
more
visible
join
the
board
of
director
be
a
big
step
in
that
direction
give
that
ellison
have
sometimes
refer
to
catz
as
a
possible
successor
how
do
he
want
her
role
to
evolve
over
the
next
few
year
i
m
not
sure
it
need
to
evolve
much
we
work
extremely
well
together
sometimes
we
re
too
aggressive
about
push
new
system
and
procedure
into
the
company
but
we
keep
on
improve
our
margin
so
it
must
be
work
we
re
try
to
define
how
a
modern
business
operates
we
re
continuously
improve
oracle
and
our
application
software
suite
at
the
same
time
from
ellison
s
point
of
view
safra
catz
be
the
answer
to
his
prayer
she
make
him
much
more
effective
within
oracle
than
he
could
be
without
her
he
can
trust
her
completely
and
he
can
communicate
what
he
want
through
her
almost
intuitively
but
i
think
there
be
potential
danger
in
the
relationship
for
both
of
them
ellison
must
be
careful
not
to
do
what
he
do
in
the
past
with
favorite
subordinate
which
be
to
load
more
and
more
responsibility
on
them
until
something
snap
in
catz
s
case
there
s
little
chance
that
it
will
go
to
her
head
as
happen
with
ray
lane
she
be
a
remarkably
ground
person
i
once
ask
how
she
felt
when
ellison
say
in
interview
that
she
could
run
oracle
she
say
i
don
t
want
it
and
why
would
i
my
parent
use
to
say
to
me
that
i
could
do
anything
i
want
to
and
that
give
me
confidence
in
life
but
equally
i
never
felt
i
have
to
do
something
i
didn
t
feel
that
i
have
to
prove
anything
i
don
t
have
an
individual
agenda
so
don
t
make
me
one
she
s
also
smart
enough
to
know
when
she
doesn
t
know
something
but
there
be
a
risk
of
ellison
s
try
to
turn
her
into
something
that
she
s
not
some
people
feel
more
comfortable
and
be
more
effective
work
behind
the
scene
if
catz
doesn
t
want
the
limelight
ellison
shouldn
t
push
her
into
it
he
must
also
guard
against
make
her
the
main
channel
through
which
he
deal
with
other
senior
executive
amazingly
catz
hasn
t
yet
become
an
object
of
envy
and
mistrust
in
spite
of
her
unique
degree
of
access
to
ellison
because
people
don
t
see
her
manipulate
the
situation
to
her
own
advantage
but
she
s
nonetheless
highly
vulnerable
to
the
backbiting
and
jealousy
that
exist
in
all
organization
she
say
people
have
be
really
nice
to
me
a
number
of
folk
appreciate
that
decision
can
be
make
faster
because
i
ve
do
my
homework
but
you
never
really
know
what
they
think

one
of
the
most
frequent
criticism
of
ellison
be
that
even
in
an
industry
that
life
on
hype
he
take
boasting
and
overpromising
to
new
level
it
s
not
only
tom
siebel
who
talk
about
the
lie
of
larry
ellison
it
s
an
article
of
faith
for
half
the
journalist
who
cover
the
software
business
that
ellison
be
an
incorrigible
liar
who
deliberately
distorts
the
truth
about
both
his
professional
and
personal
life
i
frequently
observe
him
stretch
the
truth
to
create
a
well
impression
while
his
ebullient
optimism
routinely
put
him
in
the
embarrass
situation
of
have
to
explain
why
something
he
have
seem
certain
of
hadn
t
happen
ellison
say
i
piss
people
off
because
i
m
quite
willing
to
say
what
i
think
and
i
m
reckless
enough
to
make
public
my
prediction
about
the
future
about
oracle
and
about
the
industry
as
an
old
chinese
proverb
say
prediction
be
very
dangerous
especially
when
they
pertain
to
the
future
sometimes

some
people

i
didn
t
i
be
just
wrong
give
me
a
specific
example
of
a
lie
i
ve
told
in
business
there
s
only
one
in
my
early
twenty
when
i
first
come
to
california
i
lie
about
have
a
college
degree
so
i
could
get
a
job
big
fuck
deal
that
s
it
be
optimistic
and
exaggerate
be
another
matter
altogether
the
entire
history
of
the
it
industry
have
be
one
of
overpromising
and
underdelivering
software
executive
routinely
say
that
a
product
be
go
to
be
ready
on
a
certain
date
and
then
it
turn
out
to
be
literally
year
late
it
s
happen
at
microsoft
it
s
happen
at
oracle
software
development
be
notoriously
unpredictable
maybe
the
only
honest
schedule
be
the
one
michelangelo
give
the
pope
when
he
be
painting
the
sistine
chapel
it
will
be
do
when
it
s
do
anything
else
be
a
guess
and
sometimes
we
guess
wrong
most
senior
software
executive
don
t
tell
out
and
out
lie
about
their
product
or
their
business
but
optimism
and
exaggeration
those
be
the
standard
rule
of
engagement
for
combat
in
this
industry
i
suggest
that
maybe
ellison
have
do
as
much
as
anybody
in
the
software
industry
to
establish
those
rule
of
engagement
and
have
both
live
and
thrive
by
them
he
grin
as
if
to
say
that
s
all
in
the
past
since
i
ve
get
this
notorious
reputation
for
exaggeration
the
press
denies
oracle
any
leeway
to
exaggerate
at
all
i
know
that
so
we
make
sure
that
all
our
advertising
be
one
hundred
percent
fact
base
and
provable
our
current
campaign
be
call
just
the
fact
we
re
absolutely
rigorous
about
make
claim
about
our
product
any
claim
we
make
must
be
independently
verifiable
and
provable
i
believe
in
ad
that
list
the
cold
hard
fact
about
your
product
and
your
competitor
product
a
side
by
side
comparison
of
irrefutable
fact
unfortunately
just
stick
to
the
fact
doesn
t
necessarily
mean
you

avoid
criticism

take
me
to
task
for
be
intentionally
mislead
they
thought
that
i
should
have
list
the
name
of
the
specific
ge
power
location
that
be
currently
run
the
suite
and
identify
exactly
which
part
of
the
suite
each
location
be
run
give
me
a
break
i
never
say
that
ge
power
run
the
e
business
suite
everywhere
for
everything
i
never
say
that
ge
power
have
no
other
software
except
oracle
software
i
say
that
ge
power
run
the
e
business
suite
period
i
suppose
i
could
say
that
ge
power
run
lot
of
part
of
the
e
business
suite
at
lot
of
location
that
s
true
too
and
it
s
a
bit
more
specific
but
it
sound
strange
so
i
ll
just
keep
say
that
ge
power
run
the
e
business
suite
and
leave
it
at
that
that
may
not
be
precise
for
some
but
it
s
the
truth
what
about
ellison
s
claim
when
the
e
business
suite
come
out
that
it
be
complete
wasn
t
that
an
example
of
deliberate
overclaiming
that
come
close
to
lie
ellison
laugh
well
word
like
complete
and
unbreakable
be
relative
not
absolute
our
e
business
suite
be
much
more
complete
than
any
other
suite
of
application
in
the
high
tech
manufacturing
industry
the
e
business
suite
be
close
enough
to
be
complete
to
be
call
complete
in
the
insurance
industry
it
s
less
complete
our
database
be
so
much
more
reliable
and
secure
than
any
other
database
system
that
it
s
okay
for
us
to
call
it
unbreakable
tandem
the
fault
tolerant
computer
company
call
their
computer
nonstop
because
they
stop
much
less
frequently
than
other
computer
not
because
tandem
computer
never
ever
stop
i
read
that
some
analyst
say
that
our
claim
that
the
i
database
be
unbreakable
be
outrageous
because
everyone
know
that
nothing
be
truly
unbreakable
fine
if
the
earth
fall
into
the
sun
our
database
will
break
that
s
true
so
i
m
a
liar
whatever
ellison
do
however
accept
that
he
can
sometimes
push
an
argument
or
an
idea
just
that
little
bit
far
than
it
can
stand
once
i
believe
in
a
new
important
idea
i
get
very
enthusiastic
and
push
it
hard
once
i
start
believe
in
internet
architecture
i
couldn
t
say
anything
nice
about
client
server
once
i
start
believe
in
integrate
application
suite
i
have
a
hard
time
admit
that
there
be
any
value
at
all
in
any
best
of
breed
product
once
i
ve
thought
something
through
there
s
no
intellectual
uncertainty
remain
once
i
enter
a
crusade
i
cease
be
objective
and
i
become
a
zealot
another
aspect
of
ellison
s
bravura
style
be
equally
calculate
leadership
you
cannot
lead
if
you
re
fill
with
uncertainty
imagine
two
officer
each
lead
a
company
of
marine
up
a
hill
the
first
one
say
men
we
re
go
up
this
hill
and
we
re
go
to
kill
every
fuck
enemy
solder
on
our
way
to
the
top
i
m
go
first
and
you
re
all
go
to
make
it
to
the
top
with
me
i
haven
t
lose
one
of
you
yet
follow
me
men
cool
competent
and
confident
i
m
ready
to
follow
that
guy
the
second
guy
say
men
we
re
go
to
try
to
take
this
hill
i
have
to
admit
that
i
don
t
know
how
many
enemy
solder
be
on
this
hill
and
i
ve
never
really
do
anything
like
this
before
but
i
m
willing
to
go
first
if
you
re
willing
to
follow
me
we
might
make
it
we
might
not
there
s
no
way
to
know
for
certain
even
if
we
make
it
to
the
top
it
s
highly
likely
that
some
of
us
will
be
kill
follow
me
men
well
the
second
guy
be
impressively
honest
about
his
fear
and
uncertainty
maybe
he
should
become
a
psychotherapist
but
there
s
no
way
anyone
be
follow
that
guy
anywhere

like
a
lot
of
people
i
still
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
someone
with
as
many
choice
as
ellison
who
for
most
of
the
last
fifteen
year
have
have
more
money
than
he
could
spend
and
who
clearly
have
a
low
boredom
threshold
can
bring
himself
to
keep
on
do
the
same
thing
he
say
my
sister
told
me
that
whenever
i
get
too
close
to
a
goal
i
d
raise
the
bar
for
fear
of
actually
clearing
it
we
re
endlessly
curious
about
our
own
limit
the
process
of
self
discovery
be
one
of
test
and
retesting
yourself
i
won
the
sydney
to
hobart
can
i
win
the
america
s
cup
i
ll
find
out
the
software
business
be
a
more
difficult
test
it
s
a
much
high
stake
game
there
be
more
people
play
this
game
it
s
a
lot
more
interest
game
and
it
s
a
lot
more
excite
if
i
wasn
t
do
this
i
m
not
sure
what
else
i
would
be
do
with
my
life
it
seem
like
a
far
cry
from
ellison
s
original
motivation
of
found
oracle
to
have
enough
control
over
his
own
life
not
to
have
to
spend
time
with
people
he
didn
t
like
or
do
thing
he
didn
t
like
we
change
as
our
circumstance
change
financial
independence
mean
you
no
longer
need
to
trade
time
for
money
but
once
you
ve
be
liberate
the
freedom
that
come
afterwards
can
be
difficult
to
manage
the
good
news
be
that
suddenly
you
have
all
these
choice
the
bad
news
be
that
suddenly
you
have
all
these
choice
so
you
ve
get
to
figure
out
what
it
be
you
really
love
to
do
because
there
s
no
other
justification
for
do
it
and
if
you
can
t
find
anything
you
love
you
have
to
settle
for
do
something
that
s
merely
important
do
ellison
still
love
his
job
when
oracle
come
close
to
self
destruction
in
he
say
simply
it
s
not
like
i
have
a
choice
then
i
have
to
save
oracle
to
save
myself
what
if
he
have
be
force
out
what
if
don
lucas
have
deny
him
that
chance
i
d
have
do
what
steve
job
do
after
be
boot
out
of
apple
i
d
have
start
another
company
to
try
and
prove
it
all
over
again
first
and
foremost
to
myself
so
he
would
have
put
at
risk
his
entire
fortune
at
that
stage
around
million
without
question
oh
yes
it
be
my
life
that
be
at
risk
not
my
money
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
courage
i
just
can
t
accept
defeat
until
i
ve
be
carry
dead

for
as
long
as
it
take
to

not
minute
it
take
twelve
year
to
make

but
we
knew
if
we
could
make
it
work
we
d
win
if
we
can
make
the

and
i
think
we
can
we
ll
win
again
i

optimistic
but
not
irrationally
so
we

technically

very
hard

it
s

way
to

but
we
ll
make
it
if
the
prospect
of
beating

be
one
of
the
thing
that
get
ellison
up
in
the
morning
there
be
other
satisfaction

the
straightforward
pleasure
that

it
s

that

work
what
ellison
hasn
t
say
be
that
he
get
satisfaction
from
make
the
business
of
oracle
s
customer
run
well
it
s
the
kind
of
thing
that
politically
correct
ceo
be
suppose
to
say
ge
be
a
wonderful
company
but
it
s
not
my
company
it
s
not
the
team
i
play
on
i
m
happy
if
general
electric
be
happy
with
our
software
because
that
mean
our
software
s
good
and
we
ll
probably
sell
a
lot
of
it
we
work
very
hard
to
make
our
customer
successful
because
that
s
how
we
make
oracle
successful
when
the
lakers
win
a
basketball
championship
they
may
say
they
do
it
for
the
fan
but
i
don
t
really
believe
them
i
think
they
do
it
for
themselves
as
a
fan
that
doesn
t
bother
me
at
all
i
m
just
glad
they
won
i
get
a
lot
of
satisfaction
from
my
job
there
s
the
intellectual
satisfaction
that
come
from
solve
a
really
hard
problem
there
s
the
satisfaction
of
see
our
software
help
our
customer
especially
in
health
care
and
government
where
good
information
can
actually
save
life
but
it
s
not
altruism
and
it
s
certainly
not
the
money
maybe
it
s
just
vanity
that
motivates
me
you
can
never
really
be
certain
of
anyone
s
motif
include
your
own
you
be
well
off
measure
people
on
what
they
do
rather
than
the
unknowable
why
i
don
t
know
why
the
lakers
played
well
i
m
just
glad
they
do
i
don
t
know
can
t
know
and
don
t
care
what
motivate
jonas
salk
to
try
to
make
a
polio
vaccine
i
m
just
glad
he
do
if
you
want
to
understand
why
people
do
thing
then
take
a
course
in
evolutionary
psychology
what
we
want
to
do
with
our
life
be
the
most
important
question
we
all
have
to
answer
so
if
i
could
do
anything
at
all
with
my
life
what
would
i
do
i
d
cure
cancer
i
d
much
rather
cure
cancer
than
become
the
richest
guy
in
the
world
why
because
i
d
be
a
much
happier
person
if
i
cure
cancer
why
because
i
d
be
love
why
because
people
don
t
want
to
suffer
painful
death
why
you
know
why
although
ellison
talk
about
a
life
after
oracle
in
which
among
other
thing
he
would
spend
time
work
on
his
new
passion
molecular
biology
the
level
of
success
that
he
say
that
oracle
must
achieve
before
he
can
leave
be
so
daunt
that
he
may
never
be
able
to
escape
i
m
stuck
here
for
the
duration
there
s
no
way
i
can
stop
until
i
know
how
this
story
end
i
think
even
if
i
found
out
i
be
die
and
i
have
a

to

i

the
man
who
built

define

as
gathering

make
decision
he
also
say
that
the
hardest
thing
for
a
manager
to
do
be
to
distinguish
fact
from
true
fact
i
can
get
at
the
true
fact
much
more
easily
when
a
couple
of
layer
of
management
be
present
at
a

the
senior
guy
sometimes
don

occasionally
they
don

want
you
to

i
don

think
it
s
fair
to
describe

seem
to
me
that

interested
in
the
daily
detail

his

some
of

at
the
start
which
as
in
formula
one
race
be
frequently
decisive
must
be
fought
for
it
s
not
uncommon
for
the

to
make

even
sustain
quite
significant
damage
before

enough
to
have

big
accident
suddenly
the

on
and
immediately
ellison

out

on

this

ellison
doesn
t
get
any

the

the

of

he
have

of

hour
the

run
downwind
something
that
ellison

and
he
seem
happy
to
hand
over

bill
erkelens
met
ellison
late
in
through
an
atherton
neighbor
of
ellison
a
new
zealander
name
david
thompson
erkelens
have
sail
all
his
life
during
summer
vacation
from
university
he
would
earn
money
deliver
boat
for
wealthy
owner
to
and
from
hawaii
and
prepare
boat
for
sailor
in
the
annual
trans
pac
san
francisco
to
honolulu
race
one
of
these
be
thompson
whose
boat
won
his
division
and
come
in
second
overall
about
the
same
time
thompson
have
begin
encourage
ellison
to
take
up
sail
ellison
recall
the
day
that
he
be
work
out
on
the
stairmaster
at
the
public
gym
the
guy
next
to
me
be
david
thompson
david
just
casually
asks
me
if
i
sail
i
say
yeah
i
use
to
sail
i
use
to
sail
a
lot
then
he
ask
if
i
ve
ever
race
and
again
i
say
yes
so
he
go
on
to
ask
me
if
i
d
be
interested
in
race
a
maxi
the
big
fast
class
of
race
sailboat
i
d
always
love
sail
but
i
have
to
give
it
up
in
my
late
twenty
because
it
be
too
expensive
i
couldn
t
afford
it
then
but
i
could
afford
it
now
so
we
start
do
some
research
and
we
sign
up
the
best
designer
bruce
farr
in
annapolis
and
the
best
builder
mick
cookson

the
best
spar
maker
steve
wilson
in
new

the
best
sail
maker
the
best
this
the
best
that
we
found
the
right
people
to
design
and
build
the
fast
maxi
in
the
world
shortly
after
david
put
the
idea
into
my
head
sayonara
be
be
design
as
an
all
out
race
boat
whose
only
purpose
be
win

have
promise
ellison
to
find
someone
who
would
help
to
oversee
the
project
and
run
the
boat
since
one
of
the
first
race
that
ellison
want
to
enter
be
the
trans
pac
thompson
have
no
hesitation
in
recommend
erkelens
he
go
out
to
atherton
to
meet
ellison
and
go
through
the
first
set
of
drawing
of
sayonara
erkelens
be
hire
on
the
understand
that
he
would
go
and
live
in
new

for
the
six
month
that
it
would
take
to
build
sayonara
he
say
i
be
keen
to
do
it
so
we
sign
on
but
it
be
a
big
decision
for
us
my
wife
melinda
be
an
attorney
and
leave
her
career
a
couple
of
year
from
make
partner
and
go
to
work
on

meant
that
i
be
not

popular
with
her
family
for
the
first
year
of
the
campaign
erkelens
take
his
order
from
thompson
but
when
thompson
s
business
begin
to
suffer
due
to
the
time
he
be
spending
on
sayonara
he
withdrew
and
erkelens
be
left
in
charge
of
run
the
program
ellison
be
clear
that
his
objective
be
to
win
race
but
erkelens
say
that
it
soon
become
something
more
than
that
initially
it
be
a
result
orient
thing
but
then
we
sail
a
nine
day
race
to
hawaii
and
he
just
absorbed
it
all
he
be
up
all
night
star
at
the
star
sail
along
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
the
dolphin
and
the
whale
he
just
love
it
it
be
a
beautiful
place
to
be
and
he
be
proud
of
the
boat
one
thing
that
struck
me
be
how
important
the
people
be
to
him
he
get
a
group
of
people
he
be
comfortable
with
and
enjoy
their
company
that
become
a
really
important
part
of
the
whole
campaign
the
one
thing
that
strike
everyone
about
larry
be
that
he
have
confidence
in
the
crew
he
do
not
second
guess
them
or
question
them
or
want
to
show
that
he
can
do
a
well
job
he
be
quite
happy
to
be
part
of
the
team
work
with
the
team
and
do
his
part
i
don
t
want
to
demean
other
owner
but
he
do
not
seem
to
stick
his
finger
into
the
pie
just
for
the
sake
of
do
it
he
know
what
he
want
do
but
he
do
not
tell
people
how
to
do
their
job
i
guess
he
get
people
who
can
do
their
job
well
and
he
respect
them
for
that
i
think
that
be
why
the
people
be
so
comfortable
about
it
what
about
when
ellison
be
drive
the
boat
be
he
willing
to
be
influence
in
term
of
tactic
and
other
input
from
the
rest
of
the
team
about
what
he
do
erkelens
say
yes
he
work
really
well
with
our
trimmer
who
really
have
a
direct
line
to
the
feel
of
the
boat
through
the
sail
then
there
be
the
number
from
the
onboard
computer
it
s
a
very
technical
game
quite
a
few
people
on
the
boat
stay
on
the
number
and
there
be
also
the
feel
of
the
rudder
he
have
the
force
on
the
rudder
which
he
need
to
react
to
so
it
s
a
very
dynamic
job
he
have
to
work
with
those
people
otherwise
he
will
not
be
able
to
do
it
although
i
d
now
see
ellison
sail
for
myself
i
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
never
have
sail
at
this
level
ellison
could
so
quickly
contribute
something
other
than
money
to
the
team
erkelens
insists
the
first
two
race
sayonara
do
be
down
the
coast
of
california
he
do
a
lot
of
drive
in
the
cavalier
race
which
we
won
and
he
do
a
phenomenal
job
a
lot
of
it
be
about
number
and
concentration
he
have
a
mind
for
number
it
seem
and
he
concentrate
so
he
do
really
well
at
it
but
i
must
admit
these
be
ocean
race
so
he
be
not
right
next
to
another
boat
it
s
harder
to
judge
after
that
we
take
the
boat
to
new
zealand
and
do
a
little
refit
to
adjust
to
the
new
handicap
we
get
it
prepared
because
for
the
first
time
we
be
go
to
race
alongside
other
boat
in
hawaii
but
when
we
get
there
he
do
an
excellent
job
and
we
won
the
regatta
we
do
not
win
every
race
i
think
we
might
have
get
a
few
second
but
we
won
most
of
our
race
then
we
thought
well
this
be
all
good
for
us
because
what
be
shape
up
be
that
the
owner
association
decide
they
be
go
to
enforce
the
owner
driver
rule
the
owner
have
to
drive
at
the
start
and
the
first
lead
and
then
two
third
of
the
race
after
that
what
happen
in
san
francisco
in
be
that
there
be
a
bit
of
a
standoff
where
the
other
boat
be
go
to
withdraw
from
the
regatta
before
it
start
if
larry
do
not
commit
to
their
rule
of
drive
the
boat
i
think
he
be
a
little
reluctant
at
first
but
he
agree
to
do
it
he
start
the
boat
and
do
the
first
upwind
leg
and
we
won
every
race
by
a
long
shot
all
of
a
sudden
we
overcame
this
confidence
hurdle
he
be
well
than
all
those
other
owner
nevertheless
ellison
have
be
frank
or
modest
enough
to
admit
to
me
that
with
the
best
boat
and
the
best
crew
he
could
be
percent
less
good
than
the
next
guy
drive
and
still
stand
every
chance
of
win
erkelens
say
we
always
have
in
my
opinion
a
little
bit
well
crew
a
little
bit
well
sail
but
i
still
think
larry
be
well
than
the
other
maxi
yacht
owner
driver
chris
dickson
sayonara
s
skipper
for
most
of
the
last
four
year
be
now
on
a
retainer
of
nearly
million
a
year
fulfil
the
same
role
for
oracle
race
dickson
be
notorious
for
his
willingness
to
scream
criticism
at
some
of
the
world
s
best
sailor
and
the
yacht
press
have
be
run
story
about
a
bust
up
in
the
oracle
race
compound
a
few
day
before
in
which
fist
flew
he
say
of
the
approach
he
brought
to
team
sayonara
we
have
an
uncompromising
commitment
to
win
we
don
t
accept
excuse
for
anything
we
have
an
absolutely
ruthless
approach
to
do
the
best
we
can
what
be
also
not
in
doubt
be
his
genius
few
who
have
sail
with
him
include
those
who
have
endure
his
volcanic
temper
dispute
that
there
be
anybody
well
at
skipper
a
race
yacht
ellison
recall
the
arrival
of
the
kiwi
we
make
some
key
crew
change
and
we
immediately
start
sail
well
chris
dickson
and
brad
butterworth
be
both
great
to
get
on
board
if
there
be
well
sailor
in
the
world
than
those
guy
i
haven
t
met
them
the
kiwi
be
the
world
s
best
sailor
no
question
about
that
but
what
i
really
enjoy
be
the
greatly
improve
chemistry
on
the
team
the
kiwi
we
have
on
board
be
old
than
their
american
counterpart
and
they
come
from
more
diverse
background
a
lot
of
the
american
sailor
be
privileged
yacht
club
kid
not
all
of
them
mike
howard
one
of
our
american
grinder
be
as
regular
as
a
guy
can
be
anyway
the
kiwi
be
more
blue
collar
type
you
know
my
dad
be
an
auto
mechanic
and
he
taught
me
how
to
sail
my
dad
be
a
postman
and
he
taught
me
how
to
sail
my
dad
be
a
farmer
we

be
a
true
cross
section
of
the

the
america

italy
and
of
course
team
zealand
be
make
up
of
mainly
kiwi
sailor
that
s
not
to
say
that
there
aren
t
some
pretty
good
american
sailor
there
be
but
the
kiwi
be
well
much
well
ellison
say
that
dickson
reminds
him
of
his
friend
steve
job
the
founder
and
once
again
bos
of
apple
computer
dickson
want
everyone
to
do
everything
perfectly
all
the
time
he
s
so
brilliant
at
what
he
do
and
so
unforgiving
of
himself
that
he
becomes
unforgiving
of
others
erkelens
add
the
part
of
chris
s
personality
that
rub
some
people
up
the
wrong
way
don
t
really
seem
to
get
to
larry
he
s
get
all
the
benefit
without
the
negative
impact
of
chris
s
method
which
isn
t
to
say
that
chris
doesn
t
qualify
his
behavior
around
larry
a
little
bit
even
though
i
m
pretty
sure
that
chris
have
have
a
little
shout
at
larry
here
and
there
under
extreme
stress
but
while
dickson
may
be
willing
to
yell
at
ellison
just
like
any
other
member
of
the
crew
he
doesn
t
forget
that
it
s
ellison
who
s
pay
the
bill
when
ellison
make
it
clear
that
he
want
to
sail
the
start
of
the
hobart
despite
the
risk
of
an
accident
because
of
the
hundred
of
yacht
jockeying
for
position
in
sydney
harbor
dickson
have
no
objection
on
the
eve
of
the
race
he
told
the
other
sayonara
helmsman
he
ll
have
the
helm
for
the
start
and
he
ll
keep
it
until
he
get
sick
of
it
i
ll
be
there
to
give
him
guidance
he
s
the
bos
and
that
s
it
the
sydney
to
hobart
which
sayonara
won
have
go
down
in
yacht
history
as
one
of
the
most
lethal
ocean
race
ever
only
of
the
boat
that
start
make
it
to
hobart
when
the
fleet
hit
hurricane
force
wind
in
the
bass
strait
which
separate
australia
from
tasmania
seven
boat
be
abandon
at
sea
five
sank
and
six
sailor
lose
their
life
despite
the
heroism
of
the
air
sea
rescue
service
ellison
have
say
he
be
traumatize
by
the
experience
and
he
have
sworn
never
to
enter
the
race
again
erkelens
have
a
close
up
view
of
how
ellison
respond
to
the
stress
and
the
physical
danger
well
i
think
he
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
be
in
awe
of
the
size
of
the
sea
the
condition
of
the
ocean
not
just
the
wind
there
be
wind
sixty
eight
knot
or
whatever
but
the
sea
state
be
much
big
than
that
wind
would
normally
kick
up
even
people
on
our
boat
that
have
do
three
or
four
whitbreads
the
around
the
world
yacht
race
be
amaze
at
the
size
of
the
wave
it
be
difficult
for
everyone
it
be
physically
stressful
you
could
not
sleep
you
be
be
bruise
by
the
wave
smash
you
larry
told
me
that
he
be
comfortable
in
the
situation
as
long
as
we
the
rest
of
the
crew
be
comfortable
the
point
be
i
think
that
he
have
confidence
in
us
confidence
that
we
would
get
through
it
he
could
have
be
in
a
safer
place
that
s
for
sure
but
if
you
be
go
to
do
it
you
could
not
have
be
with
a
well
group
of
people
i
think
that
help
him
deal
with
the
situation
for
erkelens
ellison
s
fine
hour
as
owner
driver
of
sayonara
be
not
the
hobart
but
a
long
distance
race
to
bermuda
that
be
part
of
the
maxi
world
championship
the
race
be
worth
time
the
normal
number
of
point
to
the
winner
but
it
didn
t
go
well
for
sayonara
erkelens
say
it
be
a
real
light
air
race
and
on
the
even
before
we
finish
we
saw
boat
several
mile
ahead
of
us
on
the
horizon
jibing
to
make
bermuda
on
starboard
we
be
lose
the
regatta
at
that
stage
the
lead
boat
be
alexia
if
alexia
won
the
race
and
sayonara
fail
to
finish
high
than
fourth
alexia
would
win
the
world
championship
by
half
a
point
the
race
tactician
thought
they
have
come
up
with
a
way
to
use
the
wind
angle
to
bring
sayonara
back
into
contention
but
if
they
guess
wrong
and
the
wind
become
lighter
again
sayonara
would
not
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
her
superior
size
in
fact
the
wind
do
begin
to
lighten
erkelens
say
i
remember
larry
say
you
guy
i
think
we
need
to
jibe
so
we
jibed
back
and
he
make
a
strong
call
some
people
be
rumble
a
little
bit
we
jibed
back
into
the
cloud
and
get
another
six
knot
breeze
or
so
and
sail
for
another
hour
and
a
half
it
turn
out
we
have
sail
around
them
all
except
alexia
at
that
stage
alexia
be
fifty
mile
ahead
but
by
the
finish
we
have
shave
that
down
to
about
six
it
take
another
ten
hour
for
the
rest
of
the
boat
to
even
finish
that
really
impressed
me
it
be
the
big
single
gain
we
ever
make
in
a
race

ellison
first
learn
to
sail
when
he
come
to
california
in
the
mid
s
he
take
a
sail
course
at
the
university
of
california
and
get
start
on
a
little
plastic
boat
call
a
lido
he
say
i
should
tell
people
i
attend
the
university
of
california
and
major
in
sail
he
enjoy
it
so
much
that
a
year
or
so
later
when
he
be
twenty
five
he
bought
first
a
twenty
four
foot
boat
and
then
something
quite
substantial
a
thirty
four
foot
race
sloop
i
be
passionate
about
sail
and
the
idea
of
sail
the
idyllic
independence
travel
with
the
wind
that
kind
of
stuff
i
guess
a
lot
of
people
have
dream
of
sail
around
the
world
i
be
one
of
them
i
remember
reading
robin
lee
graham
s
story
of
sail
his
twenty
four
foot
sloop
the
dove
around
the
world
it
be
publish
in
national
geographic
i
m
pretty
sure
it
be
the
most
popular
story
they
ever
ran
but
if
ellison
like
most
other
leisure
sailor
fantasize
about
circumnavigation
the
reality
be
more
prosaic
i
be
just
race
around
the
bay
sail
out
to
the
farallons
island
mile
west
of
san
francisco
and
back
i
be
have
a
good
time
the
trouble
be
i
really
couldn
t
afford
it
the
point
be
driven
home
to
him
when
race
galilee
hitchhiker
the
thirty
four
footer
he
have
bought
by
borrowing
during
a
slight
storm
at
the
start
of
a
light
ship
race
the
jib
halyard
broke
and
ellison
s
first
wife
adda
nearly
fell
overboard
try
to
bring
the
expensive
sail
back
on
board
soon
afterward
he
sell
the
boat
i
finally
have
to
accept
that
eat
come
before
sail
in
maslow
s
hierarchy
of
need
adda
have
become
so
worried
about
how
much
money
the
boat
be
eat
that
she
be
driven
to
seek
counsel
it
be
year
before
he
get
back
on
the
water
he
be
a
wealthy
man
from
the
day
that
oracle
go
public
in
surely
when
he
look
at
other
people
s
boat
he
must
have
thought
why
don
t
i
go
and
get
one
like
that
it
just
never
really
occur
to
me
when
i
want
to
go
on
holiday
i
d
always
go
to
warm
place
near
the
water
like
kona
village
in
hawaii
but
i
never
go
on
boat
i
read
rode
my
bike
surfed
a
bit
but
no
boat
as
my
son
david
get
old
he
rekindle
my
interest
in
a
lot
of
thing
he
get
me
back
into
fly
he
get
me
back
into
play
guitar
another
david
thompson
get
me
back
into

then
my
ex
girlfriend
kristine
convince
me
to
buy
my
first
motor
yacht
it
be
the
summer

she
point
at
sayonara
and
say
that

she
then
point
at
the
footer
and
say
that
s
a
yacht
to
my
credit
i
immediately
recognize
that
she
be
right
so
i
go
right
out
and
bought
october
rise
rename
sakura
by
ellison
and
subsequently
the
center
of
a
legal
dispute
with
the

from
kirk
kerkorian

around
million
i
d
never
even
be

big
motor
yacht
until
i
bought
one
what
ellison
seem
to
be
say
be
that
it
have
take
him
a
while
to
realize
he
be
rich
enough
to
indulge
whatever
desire
he
might
have
it
s
true
he
say
my
life
have
be
focus
on
work
work
and
more
work
oracle
have
crashed
in
and
i
couldn
t
rest
until
it
be
healthy
again
i
didn
t
have
any
time
to
spend
money
or
think
about
spending
money
i
bought
a
house
in
atherton
in
but
that
be
my
only
house
and
i
only
have

don
lucas
told
me
i
have
to
get
rid
of

and
buy
a
more
appropriate
car
for
business
i
love
my
old
rotary
engine
rx
but
don
be
right
so
i
sell
the
rx
and
bought
a
big
silver
mercedes
a
few
year
back
mike
seashols
oracle
s
then
head
of
sale
have
look
at
my
cheap
seiko
watch
and
say
come
on
larry
you
shouldn
t
wear
a
watch
like
that
you
should
have
a
rolex
he
then
hand
me
his
solid
gold
rolex
president
so
i
could
feel
how
heavy
it
be
i
go
out
a
bought
a
rolex
but
in
stainless
i
just
couldn
t
deal
with
the
gold
anyway
it
take
a
while
and
a
lot
of
help
from
my
friend
but
i
m
now
world
class
at
buying
thing
i
move
from
rolex
to
patek
philippe
i
still
have
a
mercedes
a
couple
of
them
actually
plus
the
new
bmw
z
a
mclaren
f
and
a
bentley
it
take
me
a
while
to
learn
how
to
spend
money
but
once
i
get
start
ellison
laugh
i
discover
that
i
have
a
real
talent
for
it
so
when
david
thompson
put
the
idea
into
ellison
s
head
that
he
might
like
to
get
himself
a
maxi
yacht
he
be
push
on
an
open
door
but
why
do
he
want
a
pure
race
machine
instead
of
just
a
really
nice
big
sail
boat
i
talk
with
rupert
murdoch
about
the
big
luxury
sail
yacht
that
he
and
his
family
enjoy
spending
time
on
but
i
never
thought
of
sail
as
a
form
of
relaxation
to
me
sail
be
about
adventure
and
competition
sail
be
completely
unpredictable
if
mother
nature
decides
to
make
thing
difficult
for
you
it
can
get
pretty
intense
pretty
fast
you
always
have
to
be
prepared
for
that
if
i
want
to
relax
i
ll
read
a
book
i
d
mention
to
ellison
a
few
day
earlier
a
theory
i
have
that
people
who
have
very
intense
work
life
often
found
relax
difficult
and
that
the
best
they
could
do
be
to
find
some
alternative
stress
that
so
fully
engage
their
attention
that
it
drove
everything
else
out
of
their
mind
ellison
say
that
s
certainly
true
for
me
i
d
never
heard
the
expression
alternative
stress
until
you
say
it
but
it
immediately
struck
me
as
a
perfect
explanation
for
all
my
hobby
sail
and
fly
be
definitely
alternative
stress
activity
drive
the
boat
or
the
plane
demand
total
concentration
play
classical
guitar
be
not
stressful
exactly
unless
i
do
it
in
public
but
it
require
one
hundred
percent
of
my
attention
so
the
idea
of
race
at
the
very
high
level
just
seem
like
an
obvious
thing
to
do
if
you
be
go
to
do
it
at
all
why
not
i
could
afford
a
big
maxi
boat
they
re
slightly
large
than
the
america
s
cup
boat
and
maybe
slightly
faster
and
the
idea
of
race
one
seem
very
excite
to
me
my
nephew
judge
jimmy
want
me
to
buy
a
basketball
team
but
if
i
bought
an
nba
team
league
rule
would
prevent
me
from
play
point
guard
that
plus
a
strong
aversion
to
public
humiliation
anyway
the
point
be
i
don
t
want
to
watch
i
want
to
play
i
want
to
be
a
part
of
the
team
i
want
to
be
taught
by
coached
by
and
sail
with
the
best
people
in
the
business
i
like
feel
a
part
of
the
team
at
oracle
i
enjoy
the
people
i
work
with
very
very
much
otherwise
i
couldn
t
spend
so
much
of
my
time
with
them
sail
be
similar
in
one
way
because
i
love
work
with
the
sayonara
crew
but
it
s
totally
different
in
another
because
i
m
not
the
star
i
m
just
a
pretty
good
amateur
driver
the
rest
of
the
sayonara
crew
be
the
best
professional
sailor
on
the
planet
chris
dickson
brad
butterworth
these
guy
be
unbelievably
good
at
what
they
do
they
re
the
best
when
we
won
our
four
maxi
world
championship
i
usually
race
against
other
amateur
driver
but
some
of
the
time
i
get
a
chance
to
drive
against
the
best
professional
driver
in
the
world
i
ve
even
be
at
the
wheel
of
sayonara
when
russell
coutts
be
drive
morning
glory
imagine
go
head
to
head
with
russell
coutts
how
cool
be
that
from
sayonara
compete
in
all
the
maxi
yacht
series
and
nearly
all
the
major
ocean
race
ellison
say
that
he
miss
only
one
when
his
daughter
megan
be
graduate
from
grammar
school
sail
for
several
week
every
year
he
also
think
his
drive
skill
become
well
than
respectable
i
m
very
focus
i
put
the
time
in
and
my
drive
get
well
and
well
i
do
most
of
the
drive
during
all
four
of
our
maxi
world
championship
sayonara
won
every
buoy
regatta
she
ever
enter
the
second
best
maxi
team
morning
glory
own
by
sap
ceo
hasso
plattner
and
skipper
by
russell
coutts
never
beat
us
not
even
in
one
race
we
come
second
in
a
couple
of
ocean
race
like
bermuda
but
we
won
every
buoy
regatta
i
m
very
proud
of
that
one
of
the
reason
i
do
the
hobart
be
to
find
out
how
much
i
have
improve
as
a
driver
since
the
first
time
i
do
the
hobart
i
thought
i
have
improve
a
lot
i
want
to
test
myself
the
time
ellison
spent
sail
the
alternative
stress
coincide
with
accusation
from
within
the
company
that
his
new
interest
and
his
new
toy
be
take
him
away
from
oracle
naturally
he
doesn
t
agree
win
be
a
habit
so
be
lose
compete
and
win
at
sail
have
make
me
more
confident
intense
and
determine
to
win
at
oracle
win
breed
win
the
more
you
win
the
more
you
want
to
win
the
more
you
win
the
more
you
think
you
can
win
three
of
our
four
world
championship
be
very
close
i
won
a
key
start
against
morning
glory
i
drove
past
boomerang
during
the
first
windward
beat
after
she
get
out
ahead
of
us
at
the
start
and
i
make
the
critical
tactical
call
on
the
bermuda
race
have
i
screw
those
three
thing
up
we
would
have
won
only
one
world
championship
but
i
didn
t
screw
up
and
we
won
four
i
do
my
job
and
so
do
everyone
else
on
the
crew
so
we
end
up
win
them
all
even
one
that
seem
utterly
hopeless
one
year
the
final
race
of
the
maxi
world
championship
be
the
ocean
race
to
bermuda
we
be
comfortably
in
first
place
after
the
buoy
race
finish
but
we
still
have
to
finish
at
least
fourth
in
the
bermuda
race
to
take
the
championship
now
ocean
race
be
rarely
include
in
world
championship
regatta
because
they
be
much
more
subject
to
chance
than
race
around
the
buoy
you
can
have
the
fast
boat
and
the
best
crew
and
still
lose
an
ocean
race
in
an
ocean
race
the
boat
be
often
ten
of
mile
apart
some
in
much
more
favorable
wind
than
others
well
the
wind
god
really
have
it
in
for
brad
butterworth
on
this
race
the
first
two
night
the
moment
brad
come
on
watch
the
wind
just
die
during
ocean
race
sayonara
race
with
twenty
four
people
who
be
divide
into
three
group
of
eight
two
of
the
group
be
on
watch
up
on
deck
while
the
third
group
sleep
below
we
be
becalm
for
two
night
in
a
row
we
just
go
nowhere
for
hour
and
hour
after
the
second
day
s
position
report
we
knew
we
be
in
tenth
place
behind
some
boat
we
have
never
even
heard
of
desperate
time
call
for
desperate
measure
i
look
at
the
late
weather
chart
on
the
computer
and
decide
our
best
chance
would
be
to
head
as
far
to
the
left
side
of
the
racecourse
as
possible
where
we
might
pick
up
more
breeze
and
a
well
wind
angle
this
be
a
very
risky
bet
conventional
wisdom
say
that
on
a
long
race
you
stay
near
the
middle
of
the
racecourse
and
keep
your
tactical
option
open
anyway
i
overrule
the
tactical
team
and
sent
the
boat
to
the
far
left
hand
side
of
the
racecourse
we
be
so
far
behind
i
thought
that
the
only
chance
we
have
be
sail
in
a
part
of
the
ocean
where
there
be
no
other
race
boat
if
we
get
lucky
we
d
get
a
favorable
breeze
all
to
ourselves
that
s
exactly
what
happen
the
far
left
we
sail
the
more
breeze
we
get
then
we
get
a
favorable
shift
in
the
wind
direction
everything
come
good
we
rocket
on
by
all
the
boat
that
be
in
front
of
us
except
alexia
it
be
a
high
risk
call
and
i
get
lucky
okay
i
know
that
it
be
a
lucky
call
but
it
be
my
call
at
a
critical
time
and
it
give
us
the
championship
i
ll
never
forget
it
another
thing
i
ll
never
forget
be
the
start
of
one
of
the
buoy
race
during
the
world
championship
in
newport
rhode
island
it
be
just
before
the
gun
and
morning
glory
be
well
set
up
near
the
starboard
end
of
the
start
line
i
have
sayonara
to
the
right
of
morning
glory
and
it
look
like
there
be
no
room
between
them
and
the
buoy
we
be
both
on
starboard
tack
and
morning
glory
have
right
of
way
because
she
be
the
leeward
boat
if
i
couldn
t
squeeze
between
morning
glory
and
that
right
hand
buoy
i
be
go
to
have
a
very
bad
start
so
we
ease
the
sail
a
bit
and
head
directly
for
morning
glory
at
about
twelve
knot
as
we
close
to
about
half
a
boat
length
of
morning
glory
the
guy
on
sayonara
start
scream
no
room
no
room
turn
the
boat
anyway
at
the
last
second
i
turn
up
hard
i
be
go
to
get
a
penalty
if
i
touch
either
morning
glory
or
the
buoy
but
i
make
it
we
start
two
foot
to
the
right
of
morning
glory
and
two
foot
to
the
left
of
the
buoy
it
be
very
close
to
a
massive
high
speed
collison
we
have
lot
of
speed
at
the
start
so
we
quickly
get
over
the
top
of
morning
glory
and
chris
have
me
tack
onto
port
and
head
out
to
protect
the
favor
right
hand
side
of
the
course
i
say
chris
chris
do
you
hear
those
guy
scream
turn
the
boat
no
room
turn
the
boat
he
stare
intensely
right
at
me
with
those
blue
laser
eye
and
asks
do
you
hear
me
scream
i
say
no
then
chris
smile
slightly
and
say
nice
start
i
think
wow
chris
never
smile
it
be
my
best
start
ever

ellison
knew
that
the
sydney
to
hobart
race
be
likely
to
be
tough
the
wave
condition
in
the
bass
strait
usually
guarantee
that
the
southern
ocean
the
ocean
that
circle
antarctica
be
unique
because
there
s
no
landmass
interrupt
a
wave
s
journey
around
the
world
the
wave
just
continuously
travel
around
and
around
get
big
and
big
the
world
s
big
wave
sometimes
more
than
a
hundred
foot
high
form
in
the
southern
ocean
the
shallowest
part
of
the
southern
ocean
be
a
ninety
five
mile
stretch
of
water
between
southeastern
australia
and
the
island
of
tasmania
it
s
call
bass
strait
when
big
wave
pas
over
a
shallow
sea
floor
they
become
very
steep
the
friction
of
the
sea
floor
slows
the
bottom
of
the
wave
and
cause
the
face
of
the
wave
to
become
a
vertical
wall
of
water
he
make
a
gesture
with
his
hand
under
severe
condition
the
wave
can
break
the
shallow
trip
the
wave
and
topple
it
over
forward
just
like
a
wave
approach
a
beach
in
bass
strait
the
wave
always
have
steep
vertical
face
and
they
come
very
close
together
they
hit
your
boat
in
rapid
succession
bang
bang
bang
very
unpleasant
but
they
almost
never
break
in
an
ocean
storm
it
s
not
the
speed
of
the
wind
or
the
height
of
the
wave
that
threatens
your
survival
it
s
the
steepness
and
the
frequency
of
the
wave
the
constant
batter
of
steep
high
frequency
wave
can
break
critical
gear
and
cause
crew
injury
a
single
break
wave
can
cause
severe
structural
damage
and
send
a
boat
to
the
bottom
in
a
couple
of
minute
ellison
have
want
to
do
the
race
again
because
he
thought
he
be
now
good
enough
to
be
the
primary
driver
and
it
be
a
way
of
prove
himself
both
as
a
sailor
and
as
a
man
compare
to
the
big
wave
body
surf
in
hawaii
a
couple
of
year
earlier
where
he
have
broken
his
neck
and
nearly
be
left
a
paraplegic
sail
the
hobart
seem
perfectly
sensible
macho
but
not
potentially
deadly
it
make
you
more
impressive
in
the
eye
of
others
and
give
you
a
collection
of
exhilarate
memory
he
say
the
sydney
to
hobart
be
one
of
those
event
that
everyone
think
of
as
cool
because
it
s
dangerous
but
it
s
not
really
a
dangerous
race
i
mean
it
s
not
life
threaten
it
s
just
a
hard
demand
race
you
have
to
be
reasonably
fit
to
cope
with
the
pound
in
bass
strait
but
it
s
pretty
unlikely
that
you
ll
get
hurt
in
we
hit
wind
of
about
forty
five
knot
get
bang
around
a
bit
and
won
the
race
it
be
just
your
typical
sydney
to
hobart
the
sydney
to
hobart
be
not
typical
i
don
t
know
how
but
somehow
i
manage
to
pick
the
one
year
out
of
a
hundred
when
the
risk
wasn
t
an
illusion
we
sail
into
a
hurricane
during
the
morning
weather
briefing
we
be
warn
that
there
be
go
to
be
a
storm
forty
plus
knot
in
the
bass
strait
what
a
surprise
predict
a
storm
in
the
sydney
to
hobart
be
like
predict
a
cool
summer
night
in
san
francisco
summer
night
be
always
cool
in
san
francisco
so
wear
a
sweater
no
one
be
concerned
about
the
storm
forecast
no
boat
pull
out
of
the
race
the
weather
in
sydney
be
absolutely
perfect
it
be
warm
and
sunny
and
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
boat
be
tack
and
jibing
around
the
most
beautiful
harbor
in
the
world
try
to
get
into
a
good
position
for
the
start
of
the
race
during
our
prerace
maneuvering
we
manage
to
break
a
carbon
fiber
gear
in
one
of
our
brand
new
winch
dickson
get
really
piss
off
how
the
hell
can
we
break
one
of
our
main
winch
in
light
air
before
the
goddamned
race
have
even
start
it
be
a
good
question
we
only
have
about
ten
knot
of
breeze
and
you
re
not
suppose
to
break
stuff
in
light
air
i
be
drive
the
boat
and
i
be
glad
he
didn
t
blame
me
for
the
damage
anyway
we
didn
t
have
time
to
fix
the
winch
before
the
start
of
the
race
so
i
have
to
tack
the
boat
very
slowly
and
very
carefully
that
make
start
more
difficult
chris
be
stand
right
behind
me
barking
out
tactical
instruction
i
be
at
the
wheel
do
what
i
be
told
chris
have
me
stay
away
from
nokia
the
big
boat
in
the
fleet
because
they
have
a
nasty
habit
of
banging
into
nearby
boat
we
be
look
for
a
safe
start
we
get
sayonara
into
a
good
position
for
the
begin
of
the
race
the
gun
go
off
and
we
get
up
to
speed
we
do
our
tack
slowly
and
precisely
it
be
a
good
start
we
round
the
first
mark
ahead
of
the
rest
of
the
fleet
sayonara
be
the
first
boat
to
sail
out
of
the
harbor
through
sydney
head
and
turn
to
the
south
hobart
be
due
south
of
sydney
you
set
a
course
of
exactly
degree
as
we
make
our
right
turn
to
the
south
we
drop
the
jib
and
set
the
spinnaker
the
breeze
be
out
of
the
northeast
and
increase
we
be
go
through
the
water
at
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
knot
it
be
just
about
as
perfect
as
sail
condition
could
get
we
have
no
idea
what
be
go
to
happen
to
us
over
the
next
three
day
if
we
have
we
would
have
turn
left
and
go
up
north
to
the
great
barrier
reef
that
s
where
all
the
sensible
people
have
sensible
christmas
holiday
go
instead
we
turn
right
and
race
down
the
australian
coast
toward
the
island
of
tasmania
the
wind
be
very
puffy
and
heavy
with
moisture
these
big
puff
would
hit
the
chute
spinnaker
and
the
boat
would
suddenly
lift
up
and
accelerate
through
the
water
we
be
absolutely
fly
down
the
coast
it
be
very
excite
then
this
really
big
puff
hit
the
chute
and
it
just
explodes
go
ripped
to
piece
we
have
a
nice
lead
on
brindabella
the
number
two
boat
but
they
caught
up
to
us
before
we
be
able
to
set
another
spinnaker
a
small
one
this
time
i
blame
myself
for
blowing
the
chute
if
at
the
begin
of
the
puff
i
have
come
down
fast
enough
turn
the
boat
five
or
ten
degree
to
the
right
maybe
i
could
have
save
the
chute
i
have
be
drive
the
boat
for
a
couple
of
hour
and
maybe
i
be
get
tire
i
thought
i
must
have
be
sail
the
boat
at
too
high
an
angle
that
s
what
put
too
much
pressure
on
the
spinnaker
maybe
i
should
get
off
the
wheel
so
i
ask
brad
butterworth
if
he
want
to
drive
the
wind
be
get
strong
and
it
s
very
puffy
very
heavy
it
feel
different
from
anything
i
d
ever
experienced
we
re
now
do
eighteen
or
nineteen
knot
and
i
m
look
back
check
our
lead
on
brindabella
then
bang
we
blew
a
second
chute
the
wind
be
twenty
five
gusting
thirty
and
the
wind
be
continue
to
build
after
blowing
two
chute
we
decide
to
be
safe
and
set
the
mini
our
small
strong
spinnaker
the
mini
be
an
unbreakable
sail
the
mast
will
rip
off
the
boat
before
the
mini
blow
up
brad
and
i
be
take
turn
drive
and
the
wind
just
kept
on
building
sayonara
be
surf
through
the
water
at
amaze
speed
twenty
two
knot
twenty
four
knot
twenty
six
knot
it
be
amaze
maxi
race
sailboat
don
t
go
twenty
six
knot
but
we
be
go
twenty
six
knot
twelve
hour
into
the
race
sayonara
have
go
twice
as
far
twice
as
fast
as
the
sydney
to
hobart
race
record
holder
wow
that
s
incredible
but
what
the
hell
be
happen
here
why
the
fuck
be
we
go
twenty
six
knot
then
this
monster
puff
hit
the
boat
and
the
minispinnaker
be
go
that
s
impossible
the
mini
can
t
break
then
i
realize
the
mini
didn
t
break
the
spinnaker
pole
lose
its
fitting
the
spinnaker
pole
be
no
longer
attach
to
the
mast
it
s
just
swing
wildly
through
the
air
that
metal
alloy
fitting
be
thread
into
the
spinnaker
pole
for
about
a
meter
a
meter
s
worth
of
three
quarter
inch
metal
alloy
thread
have
just
be
extrude
through
our
carbon
fiber
spinnaker
pole
what
kind
of
force
would
that
take
a
hundred
thousand
pound
something
like
that
that
can
t
happen
can
it
but
i
have
see
it
we
re
talk
about
bring
up
our
other
spinnaker
pole
but
the
wind
be
rapidly
clock
right
from
the
northeast
to
the
east
so
we
set
a
jib
instead
soon
the
wind
will
be
come
from
the
southeast
we
re
almost
to
bass
strait
at
the
begin
of
the
race
just
after
you
leave
sydney
harbor
you
get
prevail
wind
out
of
the
northeast
as
you
make
your
way
south
the
wind
start
to
shift
around
to
the
right
this
clockwise
shift
be
call
the
southerly
buster
and
it
rapidly
take
the
wind
around
from
the
northeast
to
southeast
to
the
southwest
we
be
now
well
into
the
southerly
buster
and
the
new
wind
be
come
from
the
southeast
we
have
be
carry
a
jib
for
some
time
and
now
we
be
hard
on
the
wind
point
the
bow
of
the
boat
as
close
as
possible
to

against

it
difficult
for
me
to
hold
my
course
we
ease
the
sheet
a
bit
to
reduce
the
stress
on
the

the
driver
and
the
rest
of
the

the

and
bad
the
twenty
to
twenty
five
foot
wave
be
straight
up
and
down
they
look
like
row
after
row
of
three
story
bubbling
glass
office
building
i
think
to
myself
it
s
a
lot
bad
than
last
time
but
i
can
do
it
the
wind
hit
sixty
knot
and
the
sea
continued
to
build
the
sky
be
black
the
ocean
be
black
there
s
no
horizon
the
wave
i
could
see
be
huge
but
i
couldn
t
see
most
of
them
behind
the
rain
and
spray
as
we
rode
up
a
wave
the
wind
would
increase
and
i
d
have
to
compensate
for
the
change
in
apparent
wind
angle
by
turn
the
bow
toward
the
wind
then
the
boat
would
fall
and
slide
into
the
trough
the
wind
speed
in
the
trough
be
half
the
wind
speed
on
the
crest
i
have
to
constantly
adjust
the
angle
of
the
boat
but
i
couldn
t
see
a
thing
and
the
instrument
be
react
too
slowly
to
be
of
any
help
i
have
to
drive
by
feel
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
the
wave
make
it
impossible
to
be
heard
unless
you
scream
brad
be
try
to
help
me
through
it
he
scream
larry
head
up
head
up
now
now
i
scream
back
i
m
try
i
m
try
but
then
i
can
t
do
it
brad
take
it
take
it
you
take
it
i
let
go
and
brad
butterworth
grabbed
the
wheel
i
couldn
t
drive
in
those
condition
i
just
couldn
t
do
it
but
brad
could
brad
butterworth
be
a
sail
god
the
sydney
to
hobart
wasn
t
even
a
day
old
and
i
have
already
be
overwhelmed
and
beaten
by
the
southern
ocean
i
want
to
find
my
limit
and
i
found
them
in
bass
strait
i
couldn
t
imagine
condition
get
any
bad
and
for
a
while
they
seem
to
be
get
well
i
be
on
deck
when
the
wind
suddenly
start
drop
brad
be
drive
and
the
wind
have
come
down
to
around
ten
knot
it
be
eerie
the
wave
be
still
big
but
the
sky
be
clear
and
you
could
see
the
star
and
the
horizon
i
thought
if
i
can
see
i
can
drive
it
seem
as
if
we
have
pass
through
this
enormous
weather
front
and
we
be
now
safe
on
the
other
side
we
have
our
small
storm
sail
up
and
we
weren
t
make
much
progress
in
the
light
breeze
we
be
just
wallow
up
and
down
in
the
big
wave
after
about
ten
minute
or
so
of
this
i
thought
that
we
should
set
our
heavy
number
one
jib
brad
thought
that
we
should
wait
a
while
longer
but
i
be
impatient
so
i
say
brad
let
s
set
the
heavy
and
get
go
brad
be
still
hesitant
he
thought
that
we
should
leave
the
storm
sail
set
but
he
agree
to
put
up
the
large
jib
while
i
head
down
below
to
the
nav
station
to
check
the
satellite
weather
chart
that
be
due
to
come
in
shortly
sayonara
s
navigation
station
be
locate
belowdecks
in
the
aft
portion
of
the
boat
right
below
the
boat
s
two
steer
wheel
it
consists
of
a
forward
face
bench
with
enough
room
for
two
three
if
you
really
squeeze
in
front
of
the
bench
be
some
radio
and
two
laptop
computer
i
sat
down
next
to
mark
rudiger
the
boat
s
navigator
as
the
satellite
image
be
be
slowly
paint
on
the
computer
screen
this
image
start
to
appear
on
the
top
of
the
screen
we
can
see
the
australian
coast
and
it
work
its
way
down
to
where
we
be
in
bass
strait
i
just
can
t
believe
my
eye
i
keep
star
at
the
screen
it
s
display
a
circular
weather
formation
with
our
boat
position
right
in
the
middle
of
it
still
star
at
the
screen
i
ask
rudiger
mark
have
you
ever
see
anything
like
this
before
he
doesn
t
say
anything
so
i
turn
and
see
him
star
at
the
screen
and
slowly
shake
his
head
i
say
well
i
have
it
be
on
the
weather
channel
it
be
call
fuck
hurricane
helen
we
re
in
the
eye
of
a
fuck
hurricane
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
hear
brad
up
on
deck
he
s
scream
the
wind
s
come
the
wind
s
come
fast
get
that
fuck
jib
down
get
it
down
on
deck
now
the
wind
go
from
ten
to
over
fifty
knot
in
less
than
a
minute
unbelievable
we
have
sail
into
the
eye
of
a
hurricane
i
thought
we
have
sail
through
a
front
along
with
everyone
else
he
be
shock
by
the
ferocity
of
the
weather
condition
and
physically
drain
by
the
batter
and
the
sickness
but
he
be
still
able
to
come
up
with
a
steady
supply
of
quip
that
ellison
himself
admits
sound
rather
smart
alecky
in
retrospect
but
how
have
he
coped
with
what
must
have
be
real
terror
fear
be
interest
everyone
on
the
crew
be
load
up
on
adrenaline
the
fight
or
flight
thing
but
we
be
all
stuck
in
fight
mode
for
one
simple
reason
there
be
no
place
to
run
when
you
re
busy
in
fight
mode
you
don
t
have
time
to
think
about
be
scar
the
bad
time
for
me
be
when
i
be
in
my
bunk
try
to
get
a
little
sleep
i
hadn
t
slept
or
eat
for
a
couple
of
day
i
have
thrown
up
so
often
that
i
be
dehydrate
throw
up
over
and
over
again
with
nothing
in
your
stomach
feel
like
your
gut
be
be
ripped
out
i
be
totally
exhaust
so
i
wedge
myself
into
my
bunk
and
try
to
sleep
it
be
hopeless
after
two
day
of
seventy
to
eighty
knot
hurricane
force
wind
the
sea
be
massive
the
wave
i
saw
be
forty
or
fifty
foot
high
but
some
guy
on
the
crew
saw
wave
high
than
the
top
of
our
mast
the
top
of
sayonara
s
mast
be
foot
above
the
deck
the
wave
be
so
steep
that
we
didn
t
get
the
normal
ride
up
the
front
of
the
wave
and
down
and
back
instead
sayonara
would
bury
her
bow
deep
into
the
wall
of
water
come
at
us
then
the
buoyancy
of
the
boat
would
lift
us
up
to
the
crest
of
the
wave
it
be
like
go
up
in
an
elevator
then
sayonara
would
exit
the
wave
and
free
fall
into
the
trough
it
felt
like
she
be
be
push
off
a
five
story
office
building
and
land
on
asphalt
every
twenty
second
if
guy
didn
t
hang
on
when
we
start
fall
they
would
float
up
off
the
foredeck
i
saw
one
guy
up
at
the
first
spreader
more
than
forty
foot
above
the
deck
several
guy
on
deck
broke
bone
one
severely
enough
that
he
have
to
be
put
in
an
inflatable
leg
cast
pumped
full
of
morphine
and
strap
to
his
bunk
rid
out
the
storm
in
your
bunk
be
no
picnic
either
every
time
sayonara
would
go
airborne
start
fall
off
these
huge
steep
wave
you
d
go
weightless
in
your
bunk
then
the
boat
would
crash
down
into
the
water
crunch
you
back
into
your
bunk
the
impact
of
the
boat
hit
the
trough
sound
like
an
explosion
the
noise
below
be
amaze
the
hull
act
like
a
huge
bass
amplifier
it
sound
and
felt
like
we
be
be
hit
by
explosive
shell
fire
from
the
bismarck
the
bow
hit
the
wave
we
take
the
elevator
up
we
go
weightless
then
boom
over
and
over
again
and
again
boom
boom
boom
then
i
see
tugboat
mark
turner
our
chief
engineer
with
a
red
magic
marker
and
he
s
draw
these
red
circle
on
the
inside
of
the
hull
where
the
bow
section
meet
the
forward
bulkhead
i
say
tugsy
what
be
you
do
he
say
i
m
mark
the
spot
where
the
bow
be
delaminating
i
say
what
the
bow
be
delaminating
you
mean
the
bow
be
come
apart
this
be
fuck
ridiculous
i
push
myself
out
of
my
bunk
and
head
back
to
the
navigation
station
and
i
ask
mark
rudiger
to
pull
out
a
chart
and
show
me
where
we
be
we
re
about
seventy
nautical
mile
off
the
northeast
coast
of
tasmania
the
wind
be
out
of
the
southwest
and
we
re
banging
our
way
south
on
starboard
tack
i
want
to
tack
the
boat
onto
port
and
head
west
toward
tasmania
i
figure
if
we
can
get
close
enough
to
the
lee
of
the
island
we
should
get
some
relief
from
these
big
wave
that
be
try
to
kill
us
i
tell
rudiger
to
tack
the
boat
he
tell
me
that
he
think
that
tack
the
boat
will
hurt
our
chance
of
win
the
race
i
say
we
won
t
win
the
race
if
we
sink
tack
the
fuck
boat
mark
say
okay
i
ll
go
up
and
talk
it
over
with
chris
as
soon
as
we
tack
over
onto
port
we
get
immediate
relief
the
new
angle
the
boat
be
hit
the
wave
be
less
punish
after
a
few
hour
we
start
to
get
close
to
the
lee
shore
of
tasmania
and
the
wind
and
the
wave
begin
to
diminish
we
have
make
it
through
the
storm
the
bad
be
over
then
we
pick
up
this
favorable
wind
shift
tack
the
boat
turn
out
to
be
the
right
thing
to
do
for
the
race
too
god
be
smile
on
us

won
the

in

one
of

quality

that

the

appeal

he

jimmy

but
it
s
his
third
chicago
mac
it
s
a
race
that
ellison
enjoys
partly
for
the
opportunity
it
give
him
to
turn
it
into
a
family
event
and
also
because
it
allows
him
to
cut
a
dash
in
front
of
people
who
knew
him
as
a

the

joke
over
brunch
be
how
appal
the
food
be
on

and
ellison
claim
to
be
furious
with
himself
for
have
fail
to
take
personal
charge
of

leave
it

engineer

the

so
dreadful
that
it
almost
cause
a
fight
ellison
say
it
wasn
t
just
disgust
it
be
actually
dangerous
i
don

know
how
tugsy
manage
it
but
the
chicken
be
burnt
on
the
outside
and
still
raw
and
frozen
on
the
inside
i
really
thought
robbie
naismith
be
go
to
kill
him
and
robbie
s
a
pretty
easygoing
guy

first
robbie
burn
his
mouth
then
almost
broke
a
tooth
biting
into
the
frozen
part
he
be
convince
that
tugsy
be
try
to
murder
us
robbie
say
we
be
go
to
lose
the
race
because
the
whole
crew
be
go
to
die
of
salmonella
ellison
think
it
can
t
be
so
bad
again
but
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
decides
to
stop
off
at
a
deli
on
the
way
to
the
boat
and
stock
up
on
can
of
sardine
it
turn
out
to
be
a
smart
move
by
the
time
we
arrive
at

of

before
the
p

sayonara

taller

for
the
others
this
be
perhaps
their
most
important
race
of
the
season
sayonara
be
more
use
to
compete
and
win
in
the
world
maxi
yacht
championship
against
the
fast
and
most
expensive
sail

ever
built
in
fact
after
win
four
out
of
four
world

have
more

less
kill
off

as
hasso

fed
up
spending

million

routinely
lose

despite
the
warm
sunshine
the
gentle
breeze
and
the
sheer
beauty
of
chicago
s
skyscraper
shimmer
on
the
shoreline
there
be
a
quiet
intensity
about
ellison
s
crew
it
s
as
if
you
have
put
down
the
mclaren
formula
one
team
amid
some
weekend
club
racer
the
most
strike
thing
about
the
crew
almost
all
of
whom
have
sail
together
on
sayonara
for
all
six
of
the
year
it
have
campaign
and
be
now
part
of
ellison
s
oracle
race
america
s
cup
team
be
that
they
be
not
young
guy
but
grizzle
veteran
with
line
face
and
gray
hair
sayonara
have
won
this
race
for
the
last
two
year
and
the
chicago
yacht
club
have
handicapped
her
harshly
to
win
outright
she
must
cross
the
line
seventy
five
minute
ahead
of
the
next
most
potent
yacht
in
the
race
a
big
turbosled
name
decision
that
beat
sayonara
once
before
in
the
trans
pac
from
los
angeles
to
hawaii
if
we
get
a
follow
wind
for
any
length
of
time
during
the
race
the
sled
with
their
flat
stern
be
quite
likely
to
outrun
us
whereas
sayonara
be
unbeatable
upwind
ellison
claim
that
she
be
still
the
fast
upwind
boat
ever
built
the
forecast
be
for
the
wind
to
turn
all
the
way
around
the
clock
in
the
next
thirty
six
hour
i
m
already
hop
that
it
s
not
go
to
be
a
long
race
as
ellison
promise
sayonara
be
an
uncompromising
race
machine
with
almost
nothing
in
the
way
of
creature
comfort
when
bill
erkelens
take
the
guest
below
he
warns
us
to
try
to
avoid
use
the
solitary
toilet
the
message
be
to
piss
over
the
side
and
shit
only
if
you
really
have
to
to
comply
with
local
environmental
regulation
sayonara
have
be
fit
with
a
hold
tank
but
to
keep
weight
down
it
s
relatively
tiny
certainly
too
small
to
deal
with
the
digestion
of
twenty
four
men
if
it
s
a
slow
race
the
second
shock
be
the
realization
that
there
be
only
eight
berth
to
share
among
us
the
idea
be
that
there
will
be
alternate
watch
of
three
hour
off
six
hour
on
to
call
them
berth
be
an
exaggeration
they
be
more
like
narrow
hammock
place
one
on
top
of
the
other
as
for
the
cooking
there
s
a
solitary
gimbaled
burner
ellison
informs
me
that
other
maxi
yacht
have
owner
s
stateroom
that
provide
their
skipper
with
a
bit
of
comfort
and
privacy
nobody
told
me
about
owner
s
stateroom
when
we
be
building
sayonara
then
i
found
out
that
hasso
have
one
on
morning
glory
and
i
say
i
d
like
to
have
one
of
those
but
it
be
too
late
he
s
actually
quite
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
doesn
t
get
any
special
treatment
on
sayonara
and
maybe
it
s
one
of
the
thing
he
enjoys
about
the
whole
experience
although
he
own
the
boat
he
say
he
regard
himself
as
a
junior
crew
member
in
term
of
status
and
ability
and
while
that
s
not
quite
the
way
the
others
treat
him
it
s
also
true
that
there
s
no
stand
on
ceremony
be
one
of
the
guy
at
oracle
cease
to
be
an
option
nearly
twenty
year
ago
but
it
s
not
something
that
worry
him
greatly
he
do
seem
more
relaxed
in
this
environment
perhaps
because
the
burden
of
performance
be
much
more
share
with
others
after
the
excitement
of
the
start
there
s
the
fun
of
overtake
all
the
slow
boat
that
begin
the
race
in
front
of
us
what
s
impressive
be
the
constant
search
for
tiny
improvement
in
performance
by
change
sail
whenever
there
be
the
slightest
shift
in
wind
speed
or
direction
to
justify
it
it
help
have
robbie
naismith
and
joey
allen
aboard
both
kiwi
and
respectively
the
best
sail
trimmer
and
bowman
in
the
world
as
night
fall
sayonara
appear
to
be
in
the
lead
and
put
ever
more
distance
between
it
and
its
near
rival
as
predict
decision
the
mood
onboard
be
relaxed
and
nobody
question
skipper
chris
dickson
s
strategy
of
head
as
close
to
the
mark
as
possible
and
not
to
go
search
for
well
wind
we
re
make
about
ten
knot
with
a
gentle
breeze
on
our
port
beam
ellison
drive
for
a
while
but
with
dickson
try
to
get
some
rest
he
hand
over
to
mike
moose
sanderson
another
new
zealander
content
just
to
chat
and
enjoy
the
night
the
conversation
be
exclusively
about
sail
with
the
collapse
of
the
world
maxi
series
the
richest
and
most
competitive
owner
be
building
ever
big
and
more
extreme
boat
it
seem
that
the
year
of
sayonara
s
domination
be
come
to
an
end
range
against
sayonara
in
open
class
race
now
be
likely
to
be
monster
such
as
gianni
agnelli
s
ninety
foot
stealth
and
hasso
plattner
s
new
foot
morning
glory
but
although
they
be
very
fast
especially
downwind
thanks
to
their
huge
sail
area
moose
reckons
they
have
a
flaw
their
vastness
mean
that
the
try
and
test
america
s
cup
class
equipment
that
could
be
use
for
the
old
maxi
class
be
simply
not
up
to
the
job
but
the
custom
built
winch
and
the
tower
mast
be
inherently
less
robust
ellison
think
that
the
answer
may
be
to
build
a
foot
two
masted
ketch
that
could
fly
the
same
amount
of
sail
without
have
to
size
everything
up
by
more
than
percent
the
idea
grows
on
him
as
we
sail
through
the
night
race
in
something
a
little
more
comfortable
and
less
strip
down
than
sayonara
have
a
lot
go
for
it
but
only
if
a
new
boat
can
be
as
successful
the
idea
of
race
and
not
regularly
win
have
no
appeal
to
ellison
meanwhile
it
have
become
clear
that
sayonara
be
go
to
have
to
fight
to
win
this
race
through
the
night
a
light
on
a
boat
sail
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
have
be
steadily
make
ground
on
us
at
first
nobody
be
concerned
it
may
not
even
be
another
racer
and
if
it
be
it
be
sail
well
away
from
the
more
or
less
direct
route
to
mackinac
that
dickson
have
opt
for
but
as
the
light
draw
level
and
then
overtakes
us
the
complacency
evaporates
in
the
light
air
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
sayonara
s
speed
have
drop
to
about
eight
knot
while
the
other
boat
seem
to
be
make
at
least
twelve
knot
it
s
dickson

turn
to
drive
and
he
asks
erkelens
to
give
us
accurate
reading
of
how
much
ground
we
re
lose
each
fifteen
minute
or
so
after
half
an
hour
dickson
decides
to
bear
off
toward
the
rival
boat
in
search
of
the
extra
wind
that
s
push
him
past
us
suddenly
the
idea
that
we
might
actually
lose
have
enter
everybody

head
ellison
be
below
try
to
get
some
sleep
although
nobody
say
anything
they
don
t
want
him
to
emerge
at
dawn
to
find
us
a
distant
second
with
hindsight
we
should
have
move
to
cover
the
other
boat
much
sooner
as
we
move
across
the
lake
the
wind
kick
up
from
little
more
than
ten
knot
to
nearly
twenty
and
sayonara
slowly
start
to
close
the
gap
by
a
m
we
re
close
enough
to
see
that
sayonara
s
old
nemesis
decision
have
manage
to
get
the
jump
on
us
dickson
have
decide
to
close
right
in
on
decision
and
then
take
her
wind
it
s
a
brilliant
and
ruthless
piece
of
sail
as
we
come
within
what
seem
like
touch
distance
decision
suddenly
head
up
to
try
cut
us
off
immediately
dickson
shout
no
luff
no
luff
warn
that
what
they
re
do
be
illegal
and
that
if
they
persist
we
ll
flag
them
issue
a
protest
that
will
certainly
lead
to
penalty
for
a
moment
decision
seem
anything
but
decisive
but
by
then
sayonara
be
level
and
it
s
as
if
decision
have
stop
dead
in
the
water
within
twenty
minute
sayonara
have
open
up
a
gap
of
nearly
a
mile
by
the
time
ellison
surface
unaware
of
the
drama
decision
be
a
couple
of
mile
distant
but
manage
to
match
sayonara
s
pace
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
as
we
crawl
northward
to
the
manitou
island
the
two
boat
cover
each
other
neither
make
ground
on
the
other
if
it
carry
on
like
this
decision
will
finish
ahead
of
sayonara
on
correct
time
because
we
carry
a
handicap
of
about
an
hour
and
a
quarter
but
as
soon
as
we
draw
near
the
manitous
the
wind
veers
round
to
the
north
and
pick
up
speed
by
p
m
it
s
rain
hard
the
breeze
be
blowing
at
a
steady
twenty
five
knot
down
the
channel
and
sayonara
be
do
what
she
do
best
sail
close
haul
at
fifteen
knot
into
a
mount
sea
the
water
cream
over
her
deck
it
s
also
the
kind
of
sail
that
ellison
love
and
it
s
not
long
before
he
grab
the
helm
if
the
condition
be
now
perfect
for
sayonara
they
re
miserable
for
decision
whose
lack
of
stability
mean
she
be
constantly
be
blown
sideways
as
decision
fall
ever
farther
behind
until
she
becomes
little
more
than
a
distant
speck
ellison
exults
boy
we
re
really
smoking
em
they
re
not
have
any
fun
back
there
they
can
kiss
that
correct
time
trophy
good
bye
but
before
dusk
the
speck
of
decision
s
sail
becomes
just
visible
on
the
horizon
some
ten
mile
away
despite
ellison
s
braggadocio
with
only
another
two
or
three
hour
to
mackinac
it
s
still
touch
and
go
whether
sayonara
will
have
enough
of
a
lead
to
overcome
her
handicap
i
ask
ellison
what
matter
more
to
him
win
on
correct
time
or
be
first
to
cross
the
finish
line
that
s
easy
he
say
be
first
to
finish
be
what
it
s
all
about
this
correct
time
stuff
be
totally
arbitrary
a
fully
tricked
out
turbosled
like
decision
should
beat
us
in
the
mac
actually
finish
in
front
of
us
under
some
condition
if
the
sail
be
mainly
upwind
we
ll
win
if
the
sail
be
mainly
downwind
they
ll
win
some
year
the
mac
s
an
upwind
race
some
year
the
mac
s
a
downwind
race
so
how
do
they
figure
we
owe
her
seventy
five
minute
why
not
fifty
minute
why
not
a
hundred
fifty
minute
the
handicap
be
just
a
wild
as
guess
the
other
thing
that
would
make
ellison
happy
would
be
to
beat
the
record
for
the
race
something
he
might
have
achieve
when
sayonara
sail
her
first
chicago
mac
if
a
piece
of
equipment
have
not
fail
a
couple
of
mile
from
home
that
s
not
go
to
happen
now
just
then
an
appal
smell
of
burning
come
drift
up
from
below
after
a
succession
of
cold
meal
tugboat
have
decide
that
what
the
crew
need
to
warm
up
be
a
steam
bowl
of
spaghetti
bolognese
unfortunately
the
distinction
between
cooked
and
burn
have
once
again
elude
him
as
the
bowl
of
pasta
be
pass
up
on
deck
and
the
very
brave
or
very
hungry
begin
eat
the
sheer
nastiness
of
tugboat
s
cooking
becomes
apparent
some
eat
from
necessity
but
immediately
regret
it
others
simply
tip
the
muck
into
the
water
tugboat
be
furious
and
hurt
by
the
ingratitude
and
be
not
even
mollify
when
one
of
the
grinder
innocently
asks
him
how
he
manage
to
introduce
such
an
interest
smokiness
to
the
flavor
thank
heaven
for
the
sardine
ellison
suddenly
asks
whether
sayonara
should
enter
the
fastnet
race
in
a
month
s
time
it
s
a
notoriously
tough
course
from
the
isle
of
wight
to
the
fastnet
rock
off
the
southwest
coast
of
ireland
and
back
again
the
first
thing
to
establish
be
whether
it
s
possible
even
to
get
sayonara
there
on
such
short
notice
unfazed
bill
erkelens
get
on
the
satellite
phone
to
see
if
he
can
get
a
giant
russian
antonov
transport
plane
to
fly
sayonara
to
england
but
ellison
s
concern
be
whether
sayonara
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
win
against
the
new
breed
of
supermaxis
stealth
and
mari
cha
moose
who
s
sail
on
both
boat
be
doubtful
the
problem
be
that
they
won
t
be
give
much
away
to
sayonara
upwind
and
downwind
they
re
likely
to
give
her
a
beating
surely
ellison
persists
if
much
of
the
race
be
upwind
which
it
often
can
be
sayonara
have
a
chance
a
chance
agrees
dickson
but
a
fairly
slim
one
ellison
decides
to
call
bruce
farr
sayonara
s
designer
and
the
man
responsible
for
come
up
with
the
design
that
s
meant
to
deliver
ellison
the
america
s
cup
and
get
him
to
do
some
computer
simulation
if
sayonara
s
chance
of
win
be
less
than
percent
he
doesn
t
want
to
do
it
besides
he
have
the
excuse
of
not
want
to
disrupt
the
training
of
the
america
s
cup
team
any
more
than
it
have
be
already
by
the
time
erkelens
look
very
pleased
with
himself
announces
that
he
have
an
antonov
on
standby
ellison
s
enthusiasm
have
significantly
cool
it
appear
he
also
have
other
problem
to
deal
with
speak
low
enough
so
that
others
can
t
hear
chris
dickson
tell
ellison
that
he
s
have
problem
in
his
relationship
with
paul
cayard
the
distinguish
american
sailor
with
whom
he
share
oracle
race
s
afterguard
when
ellison
bought
the
two
boat
from
the
americaone
syndicate
that
challenged
for
the
cup
in
he
bought
with
them
a
large
part
of
the
team
and
its
infrastructure
include
cayard
as
the
leader
of
the
team
and
skipper
although
he
and
ellison
have
never
much
like
each
other
after
they
have
sail
together
on
sayonara
in
her
first
year
of
competition
cayard
saw
that
ellison
s
million
might
bring
him
the
cup
after
his
own
effort
fail
for
want
of
funding
for
his
part
ellison
be
prepared
to
go
along
with
cayard
s
involvement
as
long
as
he
didn
t
try
to
take
over
oracle
race
but
accord
to
dickson
that
s
exactly
what
s
happen
and
even
more
dangerous
the
americaone
veteran
have
become
a
team
within
a
team
leave
some
of
the
sayonara
boy
isolated
suddenly
the
rumor
in
the
sail
press
of
a
quayside
fight
a
couple
of
month
ago
at
ventura
harbor
where
the
team
be
base
seem
more
solidly
base
ellison
asks
a
couple
of
the
guy
closest
to
us
how
they
feel
about
cayard
but
get
back
only
cautiously
noncommittal
answer
the
truth
be
that
cayard
be
not
unpopular
while
dickson
s
edgy
perfectionism
and
intensity
can
put
a
strain
even
on
colleague
who
be
in
awe
of
his
ability
while
cayard
be
happy
to
go
drinking
with
the
lad
after
work
dickson
unwinds
only
when
he
be
back
with
his
family
but
for
ellison
a
choice
between
cayard
and
dickson
be
a
no
brainer
he
have
always
expect
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
sack
cayard
from
the
team
and
even
suggests
that
he
might
fly
down
to
ventura
to
see
cayard
before
leave
for
europe
in
three
day
time
decision
like
this
be
well
make
sooner
than
later
he
say
when
we
eventually
arrive
first
across
the
line
at
mackinac
and
moor
the
only
welcome
committee
be
the
wife
and
girlfriend
of
team
sayonara
it
s
not
entirely
surprising
not
only
be
it
and
a
miserable
rainy
night
but
ellison
manage
to
offend
the
local
yacht
club
after
the
near
record
break
run
a
couple
of
year
back
ask
by
the
beam
and
beblazered
commodore
what
the
club
can
possibly
do
to
make
his
stay
on
the
island
a
happy
one
a
frustrate
ellison
suggests
a
taxi
to
the
airport
i
m
worried
about
whether
ellison
be
in
a
fit
state
to
fly
the
seven
or
eight
hour
back
to
san
carlos
without
sleep
but
he
s
as
keen
to
get
away
as
before
we
decide
to
go
leave
the
crew
after
midnight
down
drink
in
the
bar
at
the
lilac
tree
and
repel
the
advance
or
not
of
local
girl
there
be
no
car
allow
on
the
island
so
we
hail
one
of
the
horse
drawn
taxi
that
ply
for
hire
along
main
street
while
ellison
rush
to
the
grocery
everything
be
open
to
greet
the
arrive
fleet
to
stock
up
with
ice
cream
bar
we
tell
the
young
driver
that
we
want
to
go
to
the
airport
airstrip
more
accurately
and
load
our
bag
onto
the
cart
it
s
only
then
that
he
delivers
the
bombshell
that
his
horse
have
be
work
for
six
hour
and
local
regulation
demand
that
he
change
his
team
on
the
way
to
the
airport
dickson
and
the
judge
who
have
be
seasick
and
look
shatter
implore
the
young
man
to
take
us
to
the
airport
directly
when
he
refuse
they
get
angry
tell
him
how
important
the
passenger
buying
the
ice
be
finally
dickson
try
bribery
which
be
grudgingly
accepted
when
ellison
return
the
youth
informs
him
that
he
s
do
this
only
because
he
s
be
told
that
ellison
will
look
after
him
and
off
we
go
at
what
seem
like
little
more
than
walk
speed
at
the
top
of
a
hill
the
driver
suddenly
halt
his
horse
to
the
consternation
of
dickson
and
the
judge
the
horse
need
a
rest
he
say
stubbornly
the
horse
shouldn
t
be
do
this
anyway
i
look
after
my
horse
although
as
tire
and
desperate
to
get
to
the
plane
as
the
others
ellison
talk
gently
and
approvingly
to
the
young
man
praise
him
for
put
the
welfare
of
his
animal
before
the
requirement
of
impatient
passenger
from
then
until
we
get
to
the
tiny
airport
fifteen
minute
and
several
more
stop
later
ellison
and
the
driver
chat
about
the
horse
and
how
they
need
to
be
care
for
when
ellison
give
him
a
hundred
dollar
bill
at
the
end
of
the
journey
a
strange
thing
have
happen
it
no
longer
seem
like
a
tip
for
bending
the
rule
but
a
reward
for

up
for

ellison
once

described

he

something
s
really

very
good
at
do
the

i
can
t

about

today
i

think
about
that
tomorrow
repression
have
be
a
very
useful
tool
for
me
to
manage
thing
that
be
painful
or
delay
a
confrontation
until
i
m
well
able
to
deal
with
it
something
make
me
put
off
deal
with
the
adoption
until
i
be
much
old
and
more
mature
so
i
just
put
it
into
cold
storage
and
didn
t
deal
with
it
at
all
i
m
sure
that
there
be
consequence
to
repression
know
something
like
that
and
not
deal
with
it
but
i
have
no
idea
what
the
consequence
be
anyway
repression
make
the
pain
go
away
i
just
freeze
it
and
go
live
my
life
as
best
i
can
when
i
m
a
little
bit
strong
a
little
bit
smarter
i
ll
deal
with
it
then
in
fact
it
be
thirty
four
year
before
ellison
felt
strong
enough
to
deal
with
the
emotional
issue
raise
by
his
adoption
it
be
probably
no
coincidence
that
his
resolve
to
confront
his
past
be
finally
summon
up
in
in
resolve
the
event
that
have
come
close
to
destroy
the
company
ellison
have
come
through
eighteen
month
of
fear
embarrassment
and
public
vilification
in
do
so
he
have
learn
something
about
his
own
resilience
and
ability
to
deal
with
intense
pressure
he
be
also
more
confident
than
ever
that
oracle
have
the
strength
to
survive
and
prosper
not
only
do
he
now
have
season
manager
such
as
jeff
henley
and
ray
lane
to
keep
the
show
on
the
road
but
with
the
release
of
oracle
he
knew
that
he
now
have
a
product
that
would
sweep
away
the
competition
in
turn
oracle
around
ellison
have
be
force
to
ask
question
about
himself
and
to
fight
both
inner
demon
and
external
threat
he
decide
that
the
moment
have
come
to
try
to
discover
something
about
who
he
really
be
ellison
say
i
d
always
be
curious
about
my
biological
parent
but
don
t
ask
question
unless
you
want
answer
after
oracle
s
crisis
look
into
the
abyss
and
survive
i
felt
emotionally
strong
enough
to
take
a
more
realistic
look
at
myself
i

i
thought
i
should
be
if
i
be
to
have
any
chance
at
happiness
i
have
to
understand
and
accept
who
i
really
be
that
require
me
to
ask
some
question
about
my
past
and
live
with
the
answer
regardless
of
what
they
turn
out
to
be

the
fact
of
ellison
s
early
life
be
these
he
be
born
on
august
on
the
low
east

post
abroad
what
happen
to
him
despite
ellison
s
effort
in
later
life
to
find
out
remains
a
mystery
at
the
age
of
nine
month
florence
s
baby
contract
pneumonia
and
nearly
die
reluctantly
she
conclude
that
it

impossible
for
her
to
work
to
support
the
two
of
them
while
give
her
son
the
care
he
need
and
in
those
day
the
only
solution
be
to
have
the
baby
adopt

florence

persuade
him

enough
to

s
grandfather
be
not
exactly
enthusiastic
about
the
arrangement

thing
it
would
have
be
an
additional
financial
burden
the

money
be
sufficiently
tight

they

bookkeeper
in

he

larry
never

lou
find
it
difficult
to
display
much
affection
to
his
adopt
son
look
back
ellison
have
some
sympathy
with
lou
s
predicament
but
he
be
still
resentful
about
be
deny
the
paternal
love
and
approval
that
he
promiscuously
shower
on
his
own
child
part
of
the
problem
be
that
larry
and
lou
have
very
different
attitude
toward
authority
ellison
say
his
worldview
go
way
beyond
nathan
hale
s
my
country
right
or
wrong
he
believe
that
our
country
s
official
and
authority
figure
in
general
be
always
right
and
should
be
obeyed
without
question
the
governor
the
mayor
the
police
be
in
their
job
for
a
reason
he
d
say
they
know
thing
you
don
t
i
thought
sure
they
re
brilliant
just
like
my
teacher
i
understood
his
gratitude
toward
the
united
state
but
i
couldn
t
accept
his
blind
faith
in
authority
figure
in
fact
i
have
the
opposite
point
of
view
i
question
everything
it
s
like
mark
twain
say
what
be
an
expert
anyway
just
some
guy
from
out
of
town
this
lack
of
respect
for
authority
make
it
just
about
impossible
for
me
to
get
along
with
my
father
a
consequence
of
ellison
s
insistent
question
of
authority
be
that
his
grade
at
school
be
usually
poor
i
didn
t
respect
or
like
most
of
my
teacher
i
didn
t
think
they
be
very
smart
and
half
the
time
they
didn
t
seem
to
know
what
they
be
talk
about
they
constantly
make
mistake
and
i
enjoy
point
them
out
they
didn
t
like
that
at
all
but
i
do
although
he
be
good
at
mathematics
and
enjoy
reading
he
be
never
prepared
to
submit
to
the
rigor
of
uncongenial
course
work
or
accept
the
fact
that
progress
at
school
depends
on
jumping
through
the
hoop
that
teacher
specify
when
somebody
told
him
that
he
would
look
back
on
his
school
day
as
be
the
best
year
of
his
life
he
reply
if
that
s
true
i
m
go
to
kill
myself
right
now
he
say
that
he
never
felt
as
if
he
fit
in
but
denies
believe
that
he
be
in
any
sense
special
i
be
a
quick
witted
and
aggressively
glib
teenager
as
i
get
old
humor
become
as
important
an
emotional
defense
mechanism
as
repression
humor
be
also
my
primary
social
skill
equally
useful
for
charm
friend
and
attack
enemy
because
i
be
so
quick
and
glib
i
thought
i
must
be
reasonably
smart
but
underneath
the
bravado
there
be
a
lot
of
doubt
and
insecurity
he
still
bitterly
remembers
a
confrontation
with
his
biology
teacher
at
south
shore
high
school
she
happen
to
be
the
mother
of
his
best
friend
dennis
coleman
and
the
wife
of
harold
coleman
a
chemistry
professor
at
the
university
of
chicago
whom
ellison
admire
for
his
intellect
and
commitment
to
reason
i
be
have
dinner
over
at
the
colemans
and
she
say
to
me
ellison
she
never
call
me
larry
i
m
go
to
flunk
you
in
biology
because
you
don
t
attend
the
lab
true
i
be
cut
lab
to
play
basketball
but
what
s
attendance
get
to
do
with
anything
i
be
get
as
and
b
on
the
exam
i
knew
more
biology
than
most
of
the
people
in
the
class
so
i
say
what
if
i
get
the
high
grade
in
the
final
would
you
still
flunk
me
she
say
yes
i
say
let
me
get
this
straight
even
if
i
clearly
prove
i
know
more
about
biology
than
anyone
else
in
the
class
i
will
be
the
only
one
in
the
class
that
flunk
be
that
correct
she
say
yes
i
say
okay
i
understand
completely
that
make
a
lot
of
sense
it
be
yet
more
proof
to
me
that
school
be
just
a
bad
joke
not
that
i
need
any
additional
evidence
anyway
her
husband
dr
coleman
notice
the
absurdity
of
it
all
and
suggest
that
if
i
do
indeed
get
the
high
grade
on
the
final
that
i
should
get
a
c
she
eventually
agree
i
be
sure
that
i
could
get
everything
right
on
the
final
all
i
have
to
do
be
study
for
a
change
the
only
thing
left
that
could
go
wrong
be
a
tie
so
as
i
left
i
told
her
to
make
sure
that
the
exam
be
hard
i
didn
t
want
there
to
be
a
lot
of
people
get
everything
right
she
be
really
piss
and
she
give
us
a
very
difficult
final
i
end
up
earn
my
c
by
get
a
on
the
final
while
the
second
high
grade
be
around
i
always
thought
it
interest
how
teacher
coach
and
other
authority
figure
value
obedience
more
than
knowledge
or
skill
and
effort
more
than
result
they
just
love
be
the
bos
the
frustration
that
ellison
experienced
because
of
his
inability
to
establish
good
relationship
with
people
in
authority
would
stay
with
him

he
discover

i
ask
him

any
of
my
program
project
late
no
be
anyone
else
s
project
on
time
no
would
you
rather
me
come
in
on
time
and
deliver
late
or
come
in
late
and
deliver
on
time
maybe
you
should
ask
the
other
programmer
to
get
a
little
more
sleep
and
come
in
later
they
might
be
more
productive
i
couldn
t
believe
it
why
should
the
ceo
care
what
time
i
come
to
work
he
s
measure
the
wrong
thing
the
only
thing
that
matter
be
result
shortly
thereafter
the
board
fire
him
and
the
new
ceo
promote
me
to
vp
of
development
silicon
valley
usually
value
function
over
form
result
over
effort
i
finally
found
my
place
in
the
world
not
surprisingly
lou
ellison
conclude
early
on
that
larry
s
failure
to
comply
with
authority
would
be
his
undo
sadly
he
could
never
resist
any
opportunity
to
remind
his
son
that
he
would
amount
to
nothing
yet
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
as
a
boy
ellison
be
unloved
lillian
never
give
him
less
than
unconditional
affection
and
doris
nineteen
year
old
be
full
of
tough
wisecrack
love
for
her
wayward
baby
brother
soon
after
ellison
learn
of
his
adoption
his
family
move
to
clyde
avenue
on
chicago
s
south
shore
to
set
up
home
in
a
second
floor
two
bedroom
apartment
next
to
the
bungalow
where
doris
now
live
with
her
lawyer
husband
david
linn
their
nine
year
old
son
jimmy
and
their
daughter
leslie
jimmy
linn
now
like
his
father
before
him
a
judge
in
chicago
say
that
he
and
ellison
be
like
brother
it
appear
to
me
that
he
look
on
my
mother
and
father
as
quasi
parent
because
of
the
limitation
of
the
relationship
with
his
own
parent
especially
his
father
he
saw
my
father
as
a
role
model
and
he
always
felt
very
comfortable
at
our
house
my
father
be
very
generous
with
his
affection
because
larry
be
there
and
he
could
see
that
he
need
it
i
think
he
felt
a
little
sorry
for
him
because
he
didn
t
have
that
much
encouragement
in
his
own
home
for
all
their
support
the
linns
didn
t
see
anything
in
ellison
to
mark
him
out
as
exceptional
just
a
little
odd
jimmy
linn
say
my
father
like
larry
but
didn
t
perceive
him
as
anything
particularly
special
although
it
s
not
a
word
i
would
have
use
at
the
time
i
remember
feel
that
he
be
eccentric
a
little
bit
unbridled
but
very
bright
he
be
very
witty
constantly
wisecrack
and
he
would
always
talk
in
superlative
term
about
everything
always
exaggerate
about
the
best
of
this
and
the
best
of
that
i
use
to
think
that
larry
be
kind
of
blowing
hot
air
he
be
full
of
baloney
his
sense
of
humor
be
built
on
gross
exaggeration
now
with
hindsight
i
see
that
he
be
visionary
at
a
young
age
but
at
the
time
that
wasn
t
clear
mainly
we
just
played
sport
he
would
never
ever
let
me
win
unless
it
be
on
merit
i
will
attribute
this
to
him
he
help
me
become
a
well
athlete
and
he
taught
me
all
about
competitiveness
ellison
might
have
be
competitive
but
he
be
incapable
of
channel
it
into
anything
useful
after
graduate
from
south
shore
high
school
he
enrol
at
the
university
of
illinois
in
urbana
champaign
as
a
premed
student
he
found
the
lecture
tedious
and
have
the
same
problem
with
authority
that
have
contribute
to
his
poor
grade
at
south
shore
he
say
it
be
unbearable
in
comparative
anatomy
we
have
to
memorize
the
name
of
all
the
bone
muscle
nerve
etc
of
a
dogfish
shark
and
a
cat
why
they
weren
t
teach
us
about
the
fundamental
mechanism
of
the
evolutionary
process
that
would
have
be
interest
that
s
important
that
s
essential
to
understand
how
the
world
work
but
no
instead
we
spent
all
our
time
memorize
a
bunch
of
latin
name
of
animal
body
part
that
s
not
learn
it
s
some
form
of
medieval
torture
i
thought
it
be
a
total
waste
of
time
and
i
couldn
t
do
it
ellison
never
get
around
to
take
his
final
at
the
university
of
illinois
whether
he
would
have
even
if
lillian
ellison
hadn
t
fall
sick
and
die
of
pancreatic
cancer
be
doubtful
but
the
death
of
his
mother
far
destabilize
him
and
he
just
upped
and
left
oddly
however
he
wasn
t
quite
ready
to
give
up
on
academic
study
later
enrol
as
a
physic
and
math
major
at
the
university
of
chicago
despite
his
evident
unsuitability
for
university
life
he
maintain
a
fantasy
that
one
day
he
might
be
a
professor
like
harold
coleman
the
university
of
chicago
be
a
marginally
more
positive
experience
than
illinois
but
he
still
last
only
a
couple
of
quarter
the
one
positive
thing
that
come
out
of
it
be
that
he
learn
enough
about
computer
program
to
earn
rather
more
money
than
in
his
previous
job
as
a
beach
lifeguard
it
give
him
the
confidence
to
quit
university
for
a
second
time
and
at
the
age
of
twenty
to
make
a
break
with
his
old
life
he
bought
himself
an
almost
new
turquoise
ford
thunderbird
and
head
west
he
say
i
just
packed
all
my
stuff
into
the
car
and
head
for
berkeley
it
seem
like
a
good
idea
if
it
occur
to
him
that
the
linns
might
feel
abandon
it
didn
t
seem
to
bother
him
it
be
as
if
the
death
of
lillian
have
finally
jolt
him
into
react
to
his
adoption
and
he
do
so
by
get
as
far
away
from
his
adopt
family
as
possible
part
of
the
linns
disappointment
be
that
larry
seem
to
be
prove
that
lou
ellison
have
be
right
all
along
jimmy
say
there
be
some
anger
my
father
thought
it
be
another
example
of
larry
be
immature
and
not
focus
i
felt
a
sense
of
be
abandon
by
my
big
brother
i
felt
a
sense
of
loss
because
he
didn
t
make
any
effort
to
stay
in
touch
the
separation
from
the
linns
prove
to
be
temporary
while
at
college
jimmy
ran
into
a
personal
jam
i
need
some
help
and
it
be
something
i
couldn
t
go
to
my
parent
with
i
hadn
t
talk
to
larry
in
a
few
year
but
i
write
him
a
letter
and
he
immediately
respond
provide
the
help
and
support
i
need
without
question
i
be
very
relieve
both
to
get
the
help
and
to
start
up
the
relationship
again
david
and
doris
be
also
relieve
to
have
larry
back
in
their
life
although
they
be
still
worried
about
the
lack
of
direction
in
both
his
personal
and
professional
life
he
seem
to
be
drift
never
stay
long
in
a
job
and
his
marriage
to
adda
quinn
be
fall
apart
when
on
the
verge
of
his
second
marriage
ellison
seem
to
be
in
need
of
their
help
they
be
determine
to
do
what
they
could
for
him
jimmy
say
i
ve
talk
this
over
with
larry
several
time
and
there
s
a
big
difference
of
perception
about
this
i
be
at
home
with
my
parent
when
we
get
a
call
from
larry
my
father
have
a
long
talk
with
him
over
the
phone
and
when
he
hung
up
he
say
larry
s
in
trouble
he
want
to
start
a
company
and
he
need
money
at
that
time
he
d
just
become
a
judge
and
his
salary
have
drop
dramatically
from
what
he
d
be
make
as
a
lawyer
but
he
say
i
m
not
go
to
say
no
to
the
kid
he
go
into
my
sister
s
saving
account
and
sent
him
the
feel
be
he
s
call
us
for
help
and
we
ll
do
all
we
can
for
him
ellison
s
version
be
indeed
a
little
different
i
told
them
that
oracle
would
go
public
in
about
a
year
or
so
and
that
anything
they
invest
in
the
stock
now
would
increase
by
a
factor
of
ten
of
course
at
the
time
they
honestly
believe
that
they
would
never
see
any
of
their
money
ever
again
in
spite
of
that
they
give
me
the
money
it
be
an
act
of
kindness
and
it
turn
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
investment
too

ellison
s
relationship
with
the
linns
grow
in
importance
to
him
and
gratifyingly
it
be
no
longer
a
one
way
street
in
which
they
do
most
of
the
give
and
ellison
most
of
the
take
as
oracle
establish
itself
and
ellison
grow
rich
and
moderately
famous
he
make
sure
that
the
linns
benefit
before
oracle
go
public
he
give
jimmy
and
leslie
stock
that
would
make
them
financially
secure
for
life
among
other
thing
he
also
provide
david
with
a
chauffeur
driven
limo
to
take
him
to
court
each
day
crucially
the
money
that
jimmy
make
from
his
oracle
share
meant
that
he
could
afford
to
give
up
his
lucrative
work
as
a
defense
attorney
to
become
a
judge
without
make
the
kind
of
financial
sacrifice
his
father
have
accepted
as
the
price
that
you
paid
for
enter
public
service
but
there
be
still
something
miss
jimmy
say
he
be
successful
he
be
a
very
wealthy
man
but
i
think
he
be
still
try
to
figure
out
who
i
be
in
this
world
where
do
i
come
from
he
would
have
long
talk
with
my
mother
tell
her
that
he
didn
t
understand
his
wealth
and
whether
or
not
it
be
all
a
dream
that
he
would
one
day
wake
up
from
but
above
all
for
the
first
time
he
have
this
curiosity
about
who
he
really
be
david
linn
be
able
to
help
by
pull
some
string
he
be
able
to
track
down
the
original
adoption
paper
and
other
record
that
make
it
relatively
easy
for
the
ex
fbi
agent
they
hire
to
find
florence
spellman
for
the
linns
there
be
the
anxiety
that
another
family
would
replace
them
in
ellison
s
affection
but
for
ellison
it
be
a
risk
that
he
could
no
longer
avoid
forty
year
earlier
lillian
have
take
larry
on
a
trip
to
new
york
to
meet
his
cousin
florence
and
her
young
family
i
do
all
the
thing
you
do
when
you
re
a
kid
visit
new

i
remember
go
to

and
go
up

have
a
great
time
but
my
mother
didn
t
she
never
take
me
back
jimmy
linn
confirms
that
lillian
fear
she
might
lose
larry
if
it
be
repeat
after
ellison
have
locate

day

of
the
blue

i
felt
a
little
apprehensive
but
call
on
the
phone

like
a
well
idea
than
just
knock
on
the
door
when
he
make
the
call
he
have
almost
no
idea
what
he
be

to
say

a
bit
awkward
but

predictable
surprise

give
up
for
adoption
ellison
say
that
he
try

himself
very
slowly
like
a
telemarketer

a
detailed
description
of
a
product
unfamiliar
to
the
person
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
when

but
not
poor

to
her
aunt
for
adoption
ellison
say
she
felt
guilty
and
want
my
forgiveness
but
i
didn
t
think
there
be
anything
to
forgive
she
have
try
her
best
and
have
do
what
she
thought
be
the
best
thing
for
me
in
fact
i
m
quite
certain
it
be
the
best
thing
for
me
but
if
ellison
have
be
expect
an
emotionally
cathartic
experience
on
his
side
he
didn
t
find
it
it
just
didn
t
feel
like
she
be
my
mother
or
even
a
part
of
my
family
there
be
no
emotional
attachment
no
bond
no
connection
but
in
that
meeting
i
do
finally
discover
the
identity
of
my
real
family
it
be
now
clear
to
me
that
the
family
that
have
raise
me
the
family
that
i
have
know
all
along
that
be
my
real
family
for
all
that
he
felt
in
some
way
responsible
for
these
people
he
couldn
t
bring
himself
to
accept
as
family
he
found
that
all
three
be
eager
to
move
to
california
and
he
bought
a
house
for
florence
and
anne
in
redwood
shore
a
stone
s
throw
away
from
oracle
he
put
anne
through
college
where
she
earn
a
teach
degree
steve
have
be
in
one
too
many
helicopter
crash
in
the
army
want
to
work
in
the
compute
industry
without
ever
reveal
the
identity
of
his
brother
steve
janicki
go
to
work
at
oracle
married
have
child
and
rise
on
his
own
merit
to
be
second
in
command
of
oracle
s
data
center
ellison
say
steve
s
be
very
careful
never
to
take
advantage
of
our
relationship
i
ve
hardly
help
him
at
all
he
work
his
way
up
the
organization
entirely
on
his
own
he
have
do
an
extraordinarily
good
job
for
oracle
i
m
thrill
to
be
related
to
such
a
hardworking
wonderful
guy
thing
have
be
more
difficult
for
anne
ellison
describes
her
as
bright
and
talented
but
he
think
that
she
s
not
found
it
easy
adjust
to
the
reality
of
her
half
brother
s
extraordinary
wealth
anne
and
steve
be
quite
different
i
support
anne
through
school
and
i
ve
give
her
money
when
she
s
need
it
that
s
very
easy
for
me
to
do
because
i
have
lot
of
money
but
sometimes
i
ve
wonder
whether
it
be
the
right
thing
for
her
happiness
and
self
reliance
have
a
funny
way
of
go
together
she
s
just
get
her
teach
credential
so
she
s
chosen
a
very
difficult
poorly
paid
but
otherwise
reward
profession
i
admire
anyone
who
try
walk
down
that
road
as
for
florence
she
live
on
for
eight
more
year
in
her
comfortable
new
waterside
home
with
anne
before
get
terminal
cancer
if
the
relationship
with
ellison
deepen
at
all
it
s
not
something
he
s
willing
to
admit
he
visit
her
two
or
three
time
a
year
and
at
least
a
couple
of
time
when
she
be
near
the
end
in
the
hospital
he
never
want
his
two
child
to
meet
her
if
he
have
trouble
show
her
much
warmth
the
same
seem
to
have
be
true
of
her
although
accord
to
ellison
she
like
to
boast
about
her
son
the
multibillionaire
she
never
express
much
in
the
way
of
pride
in
his
accomplishment
to
him
to
that
extent
it
be
like
lou
ellison
all
over
again
ellison
confesses
to
feel
some
anger
about
what
he
rather
harshly
describes
as
her
willingness
to
trade
on
his
success
i
thought
it
be
undignified
for
her
to
brag
about
her
son
s
money
i
wasn
t
really
her
son
she
have
give
that
up
a
long
time
ago
ellison
saw
florence
on
the
night
she
die
and
again
he
felt
that
she
be
still
ask
forgiveness
i
told
her
she
have
be
very
very
young
and
in
an
impossible
situation
she
have
no
choice
really
she
have
to
give
me
up
i
say
everything
i
could
think
of
to
try
to
help
her
cope
with
her
emotional
pain
but
there
be
nothing
i
or
anyone
else
could
do
about
the
cancer
pain
it
s
a
hideous
sadistic
disease
in
its
late
stage
the
only
effective
painkiller
be
death
find
and
come
to
term
with
his
blood
relation
meant
that
for
the
first
time
ellison
have
no
doubt
who
his
real
family
be
he
say
anyone
who
s
be
adopt
have
an
uncertain
sense
of
belonging
there
s
this
ambiguity
about
which
family
be
your
real
family
meeting
my
birth
mother
resolve
all
that
for
me
the
family
that
raise
me
be
my
family
they
re
stuck
with
me
i
m
very
attach
to
my
sister
and
the
judge
jimmy
linn
remembers
the
moment
well
he
look
in
my
mother
s
eye
and
say
as
soon
as
i
met
her
i
knew
who
my
real
family
be
i
know
who
i
be
now
the
relationship
with
the
linns
continue
to
be
of
huge
importance
to
ellison
and
he
see
them
as
often
as
possible
usually
doris
and
jimmy
with
his
wife
elyse
and
two
daughter
join
ellison
for
holiday
on
his
boat
several
time
a
year
whenever
possible
ellison
sends
his
plane
to
chicago
to
fly
them
to
wherever
katana
or
ronin
be
cruise
whenever
a
car
in
ellison
s
automobile
fleet
be
up
for
renewal
a
pretty
regular
event
it
s
more
likely
to
be
ship
to
jimmy
s
garage
in
chicago
than
trade
in
with
the
linns
he
s
probably
more
relaxed
and
happy
than
at
any
other
time
in
his
life
with
jimmy
in
particular
the
affection
seem
almost
physical
with
much
hug
and
kiss
there
may
be
an
element
of
overcompensation
in
ellison
s
emotional
outpouring
toward
his
adopt
family
it
s
as
if
he
s
make
up
for
the
time
when
he
be
confuse
and
uncertain
about
his
identity
but
there
be
something
touch
about
his
urgent
need
to
both
give
and
receive
unconditional
love
the
kind
of
love
he
felt
he
didn
t
get
from
lou
the
scar
of
adoption
never
quite
heal

ellison
s
need
to
demonstrate
unconditional
love
be
naturally
enough
at
its
strong
with
his
two
child
david
and
megan
it
would
have
be
easy
and
not
exactly
unusual
if
ellison
have
lose
contact
with
his
child
give
that
they
be
both
still
very
young
david
be
three
megan
still
in
diaper
when
he
and
their
mother
barbara
be
divorce
but
to
the
surprise
of
many
ellison
from
the
outset
work
hard
on
his
relationship
with
them
part
of
that
meant
stay
on
reasonable
term
with
barbara
ellison
say
i
be
determine
to
remain
friend
with
barbara
and
provide
as
much
emotional
and
financial
support
as
i
could
it
s
impossible
to
raise
healthy
happy
child
if
their
parent
be
at
war
it
s
often
underestimated
how
much
fatherhood
change
even
men
who
be
not
paragon
of
monogamy
ellison
say
it
be
amaze
my
personality
fundamentally
change
as
a
result
of
me
become
a
father
i
have
expect
a
change
when
i
get
married
but
i
woke
up
the
next
morning
feel
exactly
as
i
do
the
day
before
but
be
a
father
make
me
sensitive
to
the
need
and
feeling
of
my
kid
and
then
that
gradually
seep
over
into
my
other
relationship
i
become
a
more
considerate
friend
and
partner
i
grow

this

mystically
in

with
his
female
side
while
tap
up
megan

in
the
lonely
small
hour

a
stretch
but
he
insists
it
s
true
the
weekend
routine
be
interrupt
only
by
occasional
crisis
at

ellison
admits
when
the
company

in
trouble
i
be
a
less
attentive
father

that
as
long
as

see
the

regularly
everything
at

okay
even
if

if

for
a
while
like
in
something
bad
must
be

during
those
time
i
become
so
focus
on

that
i
lock
everything

out
even
the

i
just
get
so
much
pleasure
from
my

pretend
that
his

will
have
to
make

they
want

for
a
week
s

on

do
ellison
not

about
the
effect
that
exposure
to
enormous
wealth
and

might
have
on

for

simply
that

prince
alwaleed
she
certainly
seem
to
be
have
a
good
time
be
that
enough
ellison
say
that
he
have
come
to
believe
that
an
essential
precondition
of
happiness
be
self
esteem
maybe
because
it
s
something
he
s
found
only
fairly
late
in
life
it
take
a
good
deal
of
confidence
and
self
esteem
before
you
re
able
to
look
at
yourself
and
the
world
honestly
i
do
my
best
not
to
deceive
myself
and
i
think
i
see
the
world
pretty
realistically
i
wasn
t
able
to
do
any
of
that
until
i
become
reasonably
successful
at
the
two
thing
freud
say
be
important
in
life
love
and
work
when
my
family
and
friend
and
oracle
be
do
well
i
m
happy
ellison
be
convince
that
grow
up
with
unlimited
money
shouldn
t
be
an
obstacle
to
success
in
either
of
those
thing
love
or
work
for
his
child
i
think
it
s
wonderful
that
my
kid
don
t
have
to
worry
about
money
for
them
earn
money
isn
t
necessary
for
survival
so
they
can
move
on
to
the
other
challenge
in
life
he
recognizes
that
it
may
be
difficult
for
his
child
to
emulate
his
business
success
which
he
say
be
largely
responsible
for
initially
building
up
my
self
esteem
but
he
believe
there
be
plenty
of
other
thing
they
can
do
and
thing
they
can
achieve
other
than
amass
money
it
will
be
up
to
them
to
decide
what
it
be
that
they
want
to
be
good
at
the
second
component
of
self
respect
accord
to
ellison
be
the
simple
matter
of
treat
other
people
decently
some
would
say
that
this
be
for
ellison
a
pretty
recent
discovery
but
i
know
that
he
mean
it
he
insists
be
insensitive
rude
or
mean
to
someone
close
to
you
or
to
a
perfect
stranger
for
that
matter
be
self
destructive
and
self
degrade
behavior
you
ll
think
less
of
yourself
for
do
it
be
nice
be
an
essential
strategy
for
pursue
happiness
that
plus
excel
at
your
life
s
work
be
the
only
avenue
lead
to
happiness
that
i
ve
found
so
far
i
don
t
think
that
mass
of
money
increase
or
decrease
your
chance
for
find
happiness
in
this
life
i
think
he
s
be
a
little
glib
both
of
his
mean
of
achieve
happiness
be
more
difficult
to
find
if
you
have
a
lot
of
money
if
your
choice
be
unlimited
it
s
too
easy
to
be
a
dilettante
and
the
rich
be
doom
to
wonder
whether
they
be
love
for
themselves
or
for
their
wealth
ellison
strongly
disagrees
it
take
about
five
second
for
me
to
detect
that
someone
be
interested
in
me
solely
because
i
m
rich
it
s
really
very
easy
to
tell
as
for
work
he
say
if
you
have
to
work
to
eat
you
have
to
choose
a
profession
fairly
early
in
life
search
too
long
and
you
ll
starve
you
may
get
lucky
and
pick
something
you
re
good
at
and
enjoy
do
that
s
what
happen
to
me
but
if
you
have
money
you
can
keep
search
forever
seemingly
there
s
no
need
to
choose
but
it
just
seem
that
way
you
must
find
a
meaningful
life
s
work
or
you
ll
starve
emotionally
it
s
your
work
that
defines
you
rich
kid
start
a
couple
of
rung
up
on
maslow
s
hierarchy
of
need
that
s
all
they
don
t
have
to
earn
money
so
they
have
more
option
they
can
go
into
politics
play
in
the
orchestra
or
run
a
charitable
foundation
but
unless
they
work
and
succeed
at
something
they
ll
never
be
happy
and
they
ll
never
know
who
they
be
ellison
have
always
give
his
child
access
to
a
lot
of
money
you
can
t
create
artificial
poverty
to
teach
your
kid
what
it
s
like
to
be
poor
it
s
like
send
a
kid
to
bed
without
dinner
to
teach
them
about
hunger
it
s
phony
and
kid
see
right
through
it
the
sooner
my
kid
get
experience
deal
with
the
plus
and
minus
of
have
a
lot
of
money
the
well
he
hope
they
will
get
use
to
make
the
decision
that
go
with
extreme
wealth
while
they
be
still
young
enough
to
accept
some
parental
guidance
he
say
it
s
like
take
a
drink
he
d
prefer
his
child
to
learn
to
drink
at
home
rather
than
discover
alcohol
for
the
first
time
when
they
pas
some
arbitrary
age
qualification
i
m
curious
about
why
ellison
have
encourage
david
to
take
up
the
seriously
dangerous
sport
of
stunt
fly
it
seem
it
all
come
back
to
self
esteem
early
on
ellison
realize
how
difficult
david
might
find
it
grow
up
in
the
shadow
of
such
a
famous
and
successful
father
he
wouldn
t
have
be
the
first
child
in
such
circumstance
to
damage
himself
either
through
a
vain
attempt
to
compete
or
by
retreat
into
a
form
of
personal
nihilism
ellison
say
it
s
incredibly
important
for
teenage
boy
to
be
cool
the
danger
lie
in
try
to
be
cool
the
wrong
way
drinking
and
drive
fast
take
drug
and
all
that
other
self
destructive
stuff
even
if
they
don
t
die
in
a
traffic
accident
they
can
still
sustain
a
lot
of
emotional
damage
so
ellison
thought
about
what
be
the
best
way
he
could
guarantee
his
son
a
really
cool
self
image
and
hit
on
fly
from
the
age
of
thirteen
david
have
have
his
own
plane
and
have
regularly
flown
both
ellison
s
citation
jet
and
his
marchetti
jet
fighter
do
ellison
not
worry
at
all
when
david
be
fly
his
answer
be
no
because
worry
doesn
t
make
it
any
safer
he
argues
the
statistic
be
on
our
side
we
have
wonderful
airplane
that
be
perfectly
maintain
and
david
have
the
best
aerobatics
instructor
on
the
planet
i
point
out
that
despite
all
that
just
the
other
day
david
could
have
gotten
into
trouble
when
he
lose
his
canopy
he
manage
the
emergency
quite
well
and
land
the
airplane
without
incident
david
have
developed
into
a
very
calm
and
mature
kid
put
him
into
an
airplane
early
have
that
effect
on
him
one
serious
mistake
and
it
s
over
he
become
responsible
for
his
own
life
the
first
time
he
go
up
in
an
airplane
by
himself
ellison
be
close
to
both
his
child
but
it
s
clear
that
his
relationship
with
david
be
currently
a
good
deal
easy
than
the
one
with
megan
while
david
give
every
impression
of
be
relaxed
and
at
ease
with
himself
megan
be
suffer
from
all
the
angst
and
rebelliousness
of
adolescence
but
i
suspect
she
be
naturally
wilder
and
more
headstrong
than
david
in
other
word
she
be
more
like
her
father
one
question
that
ellison
hasn
t
discuss
with
his
child
be
how
they
would
feel
if
he
be
to
start
a
new
family
with
melanie
they
both
seem
very
fond
of
her
but
who
know
my
guess
be
that
if
the
idea
of
it
make
either
of
them
unhappy
ellison
would
back
off
from
an
unpromising
start
he
s
work
hard
and
consistently
to
keep
his
child
close
to
him
many
of
his
friend
regard
it
as
both
his
great
and
most
unlikely
achievement

for

about
a

after

and
they
met
when
he
roll
up
at
an
employment
agency
where
she
be
work
he
felt
comfortable
with
her
because
she
come
from
a
similar
low
middle
class
background
while
the
marriage
last
seven
year
most
of
that
time
they
didn
t
live
together
it
be
clear
from
the
begin
that
while
adda
take
the
relationship
very
seriously
ellison
be
a
long

from
be

ellison
say
of
her
adda
be
very
bright
and
exceptionally
pretty
our
problem
stem
from
the
fact
that
unlike
me
she
take
life
seriously
and
work
hard
at
it
she
d
get
home
from
her
full
time
job
make
a
gourmet
dinner
clean
up
and
then
start
to
wallpaper
one
of
the
bedroom
in
our
house
she
want
me
to
help
her
perfectly
reasonable
request
but
i
didn
t
want

wallpaper
the

to
go
for
a

ride
i
didn

i

just
enough
contract
program

pay
my
part

the
monthly
bill
most

backpacking
in

on
have

adda
want

how
much

she
kept
all
their
account
in
neat
notebook
it
be
like
the
early
day
at
oracle
i
never
look
at
the
number
he
say
we
respond
differently
to
not

any
money
while
grow
up
i
be
irresponsible
and
careless
about
money
while
she
be
cautious
and
discipline
to
the
point
of
be
obsessive
while
adda
would
save
up
for
cheap
piece
of
furniture
and
would
even
change
the
oil
in
ellison
s
car
as
an
economy
measure
ellison
be
perfectly
happy
to
go
and
make
a
down
payment
on
a
thirty
four
foot
yacht
even
before
sell
his
small
boat
he
confesses
i
be
awful
she
say
that
buying
that
boat
put
her
into
therapy
here
she
be
carefully
manage
our
finance
while
i
be
spending
money
we
didn
t
have
on
a
sailboat
another
strain
on
the
marriage
be
that
in
an
effort
to
establish
some
sort
of
detente
with
lou
ellison
larry
and
adda
ask
his
now
widowed
father
to
come
and
live
with
them
not
surprisingly
most
of
the
burden
fell
on
adda
and
larry
start
find
excuse
not
to
come
home
although
ellison
be
unfaithful
to
adda
the
main
reason
she
eventually
decide
to
leave
him
be
her
conviction
that
unless
she
escape
he
would
drive
her
mad
she
have
found
him
extraordinarily
stimulate
and
never
dull
but
the
combination
of
constantly
worry
about
money
and
their
entirely
separate
agenda
for
the
relationship
be
literally
make
her
ill
luckily
there
be
no
child
i
certainly
wasn
t
ready
for
that
and
precious
few
asset
to
complicate
the
divorce
ellison
felt
liberate
from
a
relationship
that
he
clearly
wasn
t
ready
for
but
the
fact
that
adda
whom
he
remain
very
fond
of
have
take
the
step
of
leave
him
be
hard
to
come
to
term
with
the
rejection
revive
all
the
feeling
of
emotional
insecurity
stem
from
his
adoption
that
he
normally
repress
it
seem
to
support
lou
s
contention
that
he
would
never
amount
to
anything
he
say
i
thought
i
be
reasonably
smart
but
i
be
go
nowhere
i
be
a
very
good
programmer
but
i
didn
t
have
the
discipline
to
work
on
problem
that
couldn
t
be
solve
in
a
few
day
i
have
no
endurance
i
doubt
i
ever
would
ellison
be
thirty
and
his
father
s
jaundiced
prediction
seem
to
be
come
true
he
maintains
now
that
it
be
a
turn
point
in
his
life
however
after
adda
left
he
carry
on
pretty
much
as
he
have
be
hike
in
yosemite
whenever
possible
date
a
succession
of
girl
and
earn
reasonable
money
as
a
quick
and
skilled
programmer
who
could
usually
be
rely
upon
to
solve
problem
but
something
have
change
slowly
ellison
begin
to
have
a
grow
conviction
that
he
be
at
least
as
capable
as
most
of
the
people
who
be
run
the
business
that
employ
him
he
also
eventually
weary
of
the
sexual
freedom
that
the
return
to
bachelorhood
have
brought
a
pattern
that
be
to
repeat
itself
over
the
year
he
say
i
doubt
that
anybody
really
enjoys
a
steady
diet
of
date
different
people
nobody
in
their
right
mind
trade
in
a
work
long
term
relationship
for
an
endless
series
of
fantasy
and
adventure
whether
it
be
the
shock
of
adda
s
departure
or
something
else
ellison
be
begin
to
realize
two
thing
about
himself
the
first
be
that
he
be
ready
in
his
professional
life
to
be
more
than
the
equivalent
of
a
hire
gun
the
second
be
that
he
need
the
support
of
a
stable
relationship
more
than
he
thought
that
say
ellison
met
his
second
wife
nancy
wheeler
when
he
be
look
for
a
car
not
a
partner
i
m
write
a
check
for
this
classic
mercedes
convertible
and
out
of
the
blue
the
woman
who
s
sell
the
car
say
i
ve
get
just
the
perfect
girl
for
you
yeah
right
i
just
kind
of
ignore
her
and
try
to
change
the
subject
what
get
his
attention
be
when
she
described
nancy
as
the
best
look
girl
she
d
see
in
her
life
and
her
husband
agree
it
be
a
brief
but
compelling
description
arm
with
her
telephone
number
it
didn
t
take
him
long
to
find
her
more
than
a
decade
young
than
ellison
and
from
a
well
to
do
louisville
kentucky
family
nancy

recently

on
her
and
they
be
married
soon
after
meeting
in
late

could
not
have
be
more
different
from
the
practical
responsible
adda
nancy
be
gorgeous
she
have
this
sexy
southern
accent
and
a
wicked
sense
of
humor

a
rare
combination
of
athletic
grace
and
feminine
charm
my
male
friend
simply
adore
her
my
female
friend
thought
she
be
a
self
center
superficial
materialistic
vamp
what
s
wrong
with
that
she
do
have
a
couple
of
quirk
though
ellison
recall
that
the
first
time
they

of
like

an
indication
that

give
birth
to
david
name
after
ellison
s

but
it
be
another
eleven
month
before
the

and
from
the
begin
the
prospect
for
the

dim
after

barbara
give
ellison
the
ultimatum
that
if
they
be
not
wed
by
the
end
of
the
year
she
would
go
home
to
oregon
take
david
with
her
ellison
say
we
have
a
number
of
problem
in
our
relationship
barb
thought
the
problem
be
cause
by
the
fact
that
we
weren
t
married
i
didn
t
think
so
but
despite
my
doubt
i
decide
to
get
married
again
i
have
one
really
good
reason
a
baby
boy
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
however
ellison
admits
that
he
be
far
from
certain
that
he
want
to
go
through
with
the
marriage
it
be
the
most
traumatic
period
in
my
life
ellison
thought
that
he
have
to
get
married
in
order
to
establish
legal
right
of
access
to
david
if
thing
didn
t
work
out
with
barbara
but
he
be
terrify
that
by
get
married
to
someone
with
whom
he
have
a
fail
relationship
he
risk
lose
control
of
oracle
if
it
end
in
divorce
with
the
company
s
grow
success
and
the
prospect
of
a
lucrative
initial
public
offering
only
a
couple
of
year
away
he
calculate
that
he
wouldn
t
get
off
as
lightly
this
time
as
he
have
when
nancy
have
left
him
his
answer
to
the
dilemma
pretty
much
destroyed
whatever
small
chance
of
success
the
marriage
might
have
have
a
few
hour
before
the
wedding
at
ellison
s
home
in
december
he
present
barbara
with
a
prenuptial
agreement
that
she
would
have
to
sign
if
the
wedding
be
to
go
ahead
it
detailed
ellison
s
asset
and
include
an
optimistic
though
as
it
turn
not
unrealistic
valuation
of
his
million
oracle
share
about
percent
of
the
company
in
the
event
of
either
a
trade
sale
or
an
ipo
up
to
million
if
the
former
be
to
occur
but
as
much
as
million
in
the
event
of
the
latter
it
then
set
out
the
term
of
any
divorce
settlement
oracle
share
would
be
use
to
establish
a
trust
fund
for
david
while
barbara
would
get
for
each
year
the
couple
have
be
married
and
a
home
in
portland
any
additional
support
payment
mandate
by
court
order
would
be
base
on
her
need
rather
than
ellison
s
ability
to
pay
to
barbara
it
be
a
bolt
from
the
blue
ellison
may
or
may
not
have
mention
the
possibility
of
a
prenuptial
some
week
earlier
but
he
certainly
hadn
t
pursue
it
as
the
wedding
date
get
closer
i
panicked
i
have
vision
of
barbara
leave
and
me
lose
my
family
and
my
company
on
the
same
day
so
i
have
this
prenuptial
prepared
several
week
before
the
wedding
actually
but
i
chickened
out
of
show
it
to
barbara
until
the
very
last
moment
what
a
disaster
as
usual
ellison
s
desire
to
avoid
emotional
confrontation
be
just
a
way
of
store
up
future
trouble
ellison
know
that
spring
the
prenuptial
on
barbara
as
the
flower
and
food
for
the
wedding
be
be
brought
into
the
house
be
not
his
fine
hour
but
he
explains
it
as
an
act
of
desperation
give
the
hurt
and
damage
cause
by
the
document
it
s
ironic
that
it
be
of
almost
no
legal
value
to
ellison
the
final
draft
of
the
agreement
be
left
to
the
two
lawyer
who
happen
to
be
stay
at
the
woodside
house
for
the
wedding
barbara
s
father
and
david
linn
ellison
say
it
be
my
idea
my
bad
ever
probably
ellison
now
say
that
accord
to
california
law
you
can
t
spring
a
prenuptial
agreement
on
someone
at
such
a
late
stage
that
they
re
almost
force
to
sign
it
be
legally
useless
and
the
emotional
damage
it
cause
be
irreversible
even
more
ironic
be
ellison
s
discovery
later
on
that
under
california
law
his
right
as
a
father
be
little
alter
by
marriage
the
only
legal
advice
ellison
have
sought
on
the
prenuptial
be
from
his
corporate
lawyer
he
say
they
didn
t
have
a
clue
about
this
area
of
the
law
they
never
should
have
advise
me
the
prenuptial
thing
be
completely
unnecessary
if
they
hadn
t
be
so
ignorant
or
i
hadn
t
be
so
insecure
the
whole
terrible
experience
could
have
be
avoid
ellison
also
maintains
that
he
didn
t
even
need
the
prenuptial
to
hold
on
to
his
stock
he
claim
that
because
he
have
own
the
stock
before
his
marriage
barbara
could
have
no
claim
on
it
when
the
marriage
inevitably
end
in
divorce
a
little
over
two
year
later
and
after
the
birth
of
a
daughter
megan
barbara
s
lawyer
take
a
different
view
argue
that
most
of
the
value
in
the
share
have
be
create
during
the
period
of
the
marriage
and
that
barbara
be
therefore
due
half
of
ellison
s
estate
after
month
of
wrangle
they
settle
out
of
court
on
term
far
more
generous
than
those
laid
out
in
the
ill
fat
prenuptial
ellison
say
i
offer
more
than
what
s
require
under
california
law
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
want
her
and
the
kid
to
be
able
to
afford
to
live
in
woodside
and
have
all
the
thing
they
want
barb
be
pretty
happy
with
the
settlement
she
once
described
her
divorce
as
well
than
most
of
her
friend
marriage
once
relieve
of
the
burden
of
living
with
each
other
ellison

a
life
devote
to

ellison
claim
that
he
be
determine
to
provide
unqualified
emotional
and
financial
support
for
his
family
and
that
he
work
hard
to
rebuild
the
relationship
ellison
s
closest
friend
steve
job
give
him
high
mark
for
his
handle
of
the
situation

say
larry
s
my
best
friend
and
i
have
a
lot
of
feeling
for
him
but
i
m
proudest
of
him
for
the
way
that
he
have
work
at
the
relationship
with
his
child
i
know
that
situation
from
my
own
life
it
s
really
easy
not
to
have
a
relationship
with
the
child
when
you
re
not
close
to
the
mother

put
a
lot
of
energy
into

have
lose
all
attraction
although
ellison
prefer
serial
monogamy
or
something
like
it
to
multiple
casual
relationship
he
thought
he
knew
enough
about
himself
by
now
to
know
that
he
would
always
find
fidelity
a
struggle
over
the
long
term
i
be
never

date
this
woman
or
that
woman
woman
i
have
never
even
met
but
the
story
get
repeat
over
and
over
again
anyway
the
press
operates
like
an
echo
chamber
the
story
doesn
t
need
to
be
true
necessarily
it
just
need
to
be
interest
it
didn
t
take
long
for
my
public
image
to
get
morph
from
outrageously
outspoken
ceo
to
frivolous
playboy
the
freewheel
culture
at
oracle
and
the
sheer
amount
of
opportunity
it
offer
its
ceo
be
to
land
ellison
in
very
serious
trouble
trouble
bad
enough
to
almost
finish
him
have
emerge
in
from
the
long
struggle
to
put
oracle
back
together
again
after
its
near
death
and
tire
of
the
fight
with
kathleen
ellison
be
on
the
lookout
for
sexual
adventure
he
soon
found
rather
more
than
he
d
bargain
for
his
relationship
with
adelyn
lee
a
twenty
something
chinese
american
who
be
a
marketing
coordinator
begin
in
an
elevator
at
oracle
ellison
have
ridden
up
in
the
elevator
with
her
a
few
time
before
but
this
time
she
brashly
ask
him
if
he
would
take
her
for
a
spin
in
his
new
ferrari
it
seem
like
a
joke
but
she
quickly
follow
it
up
with
an
e
mail
apologize
for
her
forwardness
ellison
knew
that
he
be
be
pursue
unattached
enormously
rich
and
look
young
than
his
forty
eight
year
he
be
become
relatively
accustom
to
predatory
female
but
adelyn
lee
interested
him
a
lot
of
woman
approach
me
but
most
of
the
time
i
wasn
t
interested
but
there
be
something
different
about
adelyn
something
incredibly
intrigue
i
just
couldn
t
figure
out
what
it
be
that
make
her
so
different
after
take
lee
for
a
ride
in
his
honda
nsx
ellison
have
own
two
ferraris
but
both
have
manage
to
catch
fire
without
any
outside
help
they
start
date
a
couple
of
time
a
month
all
that
ellison
could
fit
into
a
complicate
private
life
that
still
include
o
rourke
and
another
oracle
employee
an
argentinean
name
andrea
zeman
in
an
effort
to
try
to
work
thing
through
with
o
rourke
ellison
call
time
on
his
relationship
with
lee
a
decision
she
seem
to
accept
with
good
grace
and
an
apparent
desire
to
stay
in
touch
on
a
platonic
level
the
good
intention
didn
t
last
long
however
and
fairly
soon
thing
be
go
on
much
as
before
but
there
be
one
difference
lee
seem
to
be
increasingly
intent
on
tap
ellison
for
money
and
expensive
gift
send
a
series
of
e
mail
to
him
from
early
ask
him
respectively
for
a
loan
inside
information
about
the
timing
of
a
possible
flotation
of
ncube
the
massively
parallel
compute
business
that
ellison
have
bought
to
far
his
video
on
demand
vision
a
ritzy
watch
and
ultimately
a
honda
nsx
just
like
ellison
s
face
with
such
a
barrage
of
demand
some
people
might
question
what
it
be
that
be
drive
the
relationship
but
while
ellison
largely
ignore
lee
s
badgering
he
be
quite
happy
to
go
on
see
her
it
turn
out
that
lee
be
exploit
the
relationship
in
other
way
as
well
ellison
say
craig
ramsey
our
vp
of
sale
be
lee
s
bos
he
call
jenny
overstreet
ellison
s
assistant
and
say
that
he
want
to
fire
lee
but
he
be
concerned
about
how
i
d
react
because
of
my
relationship
with
lee
lee
be
unpunctual
rude
and
generally
give
herself
air
say
ramsey
overstreet
discreetly
checked
with
ellison
ellison
say
i
told
jenny
that
craig
could
do
whatever
he
want
the
fact
that
she
s
go
out
with
me
shouldn
t
influence
him
at
all
that
friday
adelyn
and
i
go
to
a
movie
the
follow
monday
she
be
fire
shortly
thereafter
she
sue
oracle
for
wrongful
termination
ellison
have
thought
that
he
could
somehow
manage
to
stay
out
of
the
whole
business
punctiliously
not
only
maintain
the
separation
of
church
and
state
but
just
as
important
from
his
point
of
view
avoid
any
confrontation
with
lee
i
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
her
job
i
want
to
stay
out
of
that
entirely
i
guess
i
be
stupid
and
naive
enough
to
think
i
could
keep
the
two
thing
separate
i
refuse
to
accept
that
two
consent
adult
be
not
free
to
date
if
they
want
to
i
couldn
t
imagine
that
she
d
just
make
up
a
crazy
series
of
story
about
what
happen
on
that
friday
night
that
friday
in
april
lee
have
go
to
ellison
s
home
in
atherton
after
spending
some
time
there
together
they
have
go
out
to
a
movie
when
lee
s
case
come
to
court
six
month
later
that
be
about
all
they
do
agree
on
a
day
after
lee
s
dismissal
she
have
to
be
escort
from
the
oracle
building
by
security
guard
after
lock
herself
in
a
room
and
try
to

have
a
nasty
surprise
while

about
i
never
told
you
to

adelyn
be

out
of
your
fuck
mind
then
i
freeze
i
realize
oh
my
god
it
s
a
setup
oh
shit
here
we
go
so
i
erase
what
i

a
very
carefully
word
reply
ellison
s
reply
which
be
copy
to
oracle
s
legal
counsel
ray
ocampo
and
jenny
overstreet
read
craig
be
you
out
of
your
mind
i
do
not
request
that
you
terminate
adelyn
i
decide
not
to
veto
your
decision
i
do
not
want
to
get
involve
in
the
decision
for
obvious
reason
this
be
the
most
amaze
note
wait
a
second
craig
do
you
send
this
note
larry
although
ellison
have
be
smart
enough
to
guess
what
be
go
on
and
how
anything
he
say
or
write
from
that
point
on
be
likely
to
be
use
in
evidence
thing
would
soon
get
bad
than
he
could
possibly
have
imagine
lee
s
lawsuit
claimed
that
i
drag
her
into
my
bedroom
and
force
her
to
have
sex
with
me
after
which
we
go
out
to
see
a
movie
benny
joon
that
s
the
story
that
appear
in
the
press
except
they
left
out
the
part
about
the
movie
the
day
the
story
broke
i
be
rid
the
elevator
to
my
office
with
this
woman
i
d
never
see
before
she
give
me
this
look
like
i
d
slither
out
from
underneath
a
rock
it
be
a
really
bad
day
not
surprisingly
it
be
a
medium
circus
as
first
lee
s
allegation
and
then
oracle
s
counterallegations
be
splatter
all
over
the
local
press
with
ellison
s
fame
as
a
businessman
also
rise
thanks
to
his
first
appearance
on
the
cover
of
fortune
magazine
the
wall
street
journal
and
the
new
york
time
also
cover
the
story
apart
from
demolish
lee
s
account
of
event
oracle
be
determine
to
show
that
lee
have
forge
the
e
mail
purportedly
from
ramsey
which
lee
suspiciously
have
a
printout
of
it
have
technical
evidence
that
the
e
mail
have
be
sent
by
modem
near
where
lee
live
but
the
clincher
be
that
ramsey
have
be
talk
on
his
car
cell
phone
at
precisely
the
time
the
e
mail
have
be
sent
oracle
could
also
show
that
the
procedure
to
sack
lee
have
be
well
under
way
before
ellison
and
lee
s
last
date
the
police
also
thought
lee
s
story
be
a
little
flaky
rape
follow
by
a
trip
to
the
movie
be
something
they
hadn
t
encounter
before
under
pressure
lee
now
claimed
that
she
have
refuse
to
have
sex
with
ellison
suggest
instead
that
she
have
reluctantly
masturbate
him
after
he
have
threaten
her
ellison
say
lee
completely
change
her
story
during
her
deposition
her
pretrial
testimony
give
under
oath
her
new
story
be
that
she
refuse
to
have
sex
with
me
that
friday
and
that
s
why
she
be
fire
the
fact
that
her
story
have
change
totally
didn
t
seem
to
bother
the
press
at
all
while
the
district
attorney
and
the
police
be
interested
in
the
credibility
of
her
claim
the
press
focus
their
reporting
on
the
lurid
detail
of
the
sex
it
be
a
good
story
and
they
ran
with
it
just
before
the
case
be
due
to
come
to
court
on
st
valentine
s
day
the
two
side
settle
oracle
agree
to
pay
lee
somewhat
less
than
the
billion
she
be
after
as
consideration
for
particular
element
in
the
law
suit
and
all
party
agree
to
drop
any
intention
of
sue
each
other
again
it
s
easy
to
see
that
lee
s
lawyer
lawrence
viola
have
conclude
that
it
wasn
t
in
his
client
s
interest
to
go
to
court
but
why
be
ellison
and
oracle
willing
to
settle
when
do
so
would
leave
a
stain
on
his
reputation
part
of
the
answer
be
that
in
the
aftermath
of
the
o
j
simpson
case
ellison
be
ready
to
believe
that
court
come
up
with
spectacularly
perverse
verdict
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
present
him
to
a
jury
as
a
sexually
predatory
billionaire
who
be
know
for
ruthless
business
practice
and
a
determination
to
get
his
way
in
the
climate
of
the
time
who
knew
what
might
happen
ellison
also
heard
from
his
nephew
jimmy
linn
now
a
chicago
judge
just
how
bad
the
experience
could
be
ellison
say
the
judge
told
me
that
trial
like
this
be
totally
unpredictable
it
s
one
great
big
scary
roll
of
the
dice
if
it
come
down
to
a
matter
of
he
say
she
say
jury
don
t
always
get
it
right
the
downside
be
too
great
lose
the
case
would
ruin
my
life
he
urge
me
to
settle
despite
that
ellison
claim
that
he
be
still
inclined
to
press
ahead
risky
or
not
i
felt
i
have
to
go
to
trial
lee
be
a
con
artist
it
be
unbearable
to
think
she
be
go
to
get
away
with
this
until
he
realize
that
maybe
there
be
a
well
way
after
all
he
say
then
i
get
this
interest
idea
what
if
we
settle
the
civil
case
lee
s
wrongful
termination
lawsuit
and
then
we
provide
the
district
attorney
with
all
the
evidence
we
have
about
lee
s
criminal
behavior
i
thought
that
the
d
a
would
have
no
choice
but
to
file
a
criminal
complaint
against
lee
we
be
the
defendant
in
lee
v
oracle
now
it
be
her
turn
to
be
the
defendant
in
the
state
of
california
v
lee
she
have
violate
several
criminal
statute
in
her
little
billion
dollar
shakedown
scheme
and
we
could
prove
it
it
turn
out
to
be
uphill
work
when
oracle
s
lawyer
go
to
see
the
district
attorney
of
san
mateo
county
james
fox
he
told
them
that
he
have
no
interest
in
pursue
the
case
finally
ellison
himself
saw
fox
i
be
not
happy
fox
seem
to
be
unwilling
to
even
look
at
the
case
he
s
the
d
a
it
s
his
job
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
then
decide
whether
or
not
to
prosecute
after
a
rather
heat
discussion
he
finally
agree
to
have
an
assistant
d
a
review
the
case
a
couple
of
day
later
into
my
office
walk
paul
wasserman
san
mateo
county
s
smartest
toughest
assistant
district
attorney
wasserman
immediately
start
ask
me
a
series
of
prepared
question
carefully
design
to
trip
me
up
if
i
be
lie
as
i
answer
question
after
question
i
watch
the
expression
on
wasserman
s
face
slowly
change
from
disdainful
skepticism
to
mild
amusement
then
he
get
this
big
grin
on
his
face
he
start
shake
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
then
he
start
laugh
i
m
just
star
at
him
unable
to
figure
out
what
the
hell
be
go
on
he
stop
laugh
for
a
moment
and
say
i
didn
t
expect
this
but
i
believe
what
you
re
tell

insightful
that

sincere
and
serious
zeman

a
perfect
witness
ellison
also
turn
out
to

a
pretty
good
witness
when

come
to
court
almost
four
year
after

settlement
from

to
make
matter
bad
for
lee
she
be
also
sentence
to
an
additional
three
year
in
prison
for
a
bizarre
incident
in
which
she
have
burst
into
a
next
door
neighbor
home
brandishing
a
gun
and
told
them
that
if
they
didn
t
turn
off
the
music
that
be
disturb
her
she
would
blow
them
away
lee
claimed
she
have
be
hold
a
comb
rather
than
a
gun
but
nobody
believe
her
ellison
still
feel
bitter
about
the
effect
of
the
lee
case
on
his
reputation
he
complains
that
her
allegation
receive
infinitely
more
medium
coverage
than
the
fact
that
they
be
eventually
disprove
in
court
a
washington
post
writer
put
together
a
big
profile
on
ellison
in
late
assure
him
that
he
wouldn
t
be
write
about
the
lee
affair
as
if
it
be
something
that
ellison
should
be
ashamed
of
the
article
be
a
hatchet
job
say
ellison
and
me
be
a
victim
just
didn
t
fit
with
the
rest
of
his
story

in
the
year
after
the
break
up
with
kathleen
o
rourke
ellison
s
life
be
quite
lonely
steve
job
could
see
that
his
friend
s
personal
life
be
less
than
satisfactory
larry
have
be
married
a
few
time
and
he
be
work
really
hard
and
he
just
end
up
do
some
of
the
thing
in
his
forty
that
most
people
do
in
their
twenty
except
that
larry
have
more
resource
than
most
people
in
their
twenty
so
he
do
it
on
a
rather
grander
scale
after
break
up
with
kathleen
he
go
out
with
a
lot
of
people
but
i
think
that
after
a
certain
amount
of
time
he
realize
that
it
wasn
t
very
fulfil
another
friend
the
nobel
prize
win
scientist
dr
joshua
lederberg
recall
at
that
time
he
have
almost
no
one
staff
the
house
maybe
just
a
housekeeper
and
one
other
there
be
no
one
else
there
i
would
sometimes
have
to
enrich
his
pantry
i
thought
he
be
lead
a
very
lonely
life
whether
or
not
ellison
be
search
for
a
more
serious
relationship
when
he
met
melanie
craft
while
depart
a
crowd
san
francisco
restaurant
in
it
s
hard
to
argue
with
him
when
he
claim
that
it
be
love
at
first
sight
i
take
one
look
at
her
and
i
be
finish
there
be
something
about
the
strike
twenty
six
year
old
with
the
high
cheekbone
and
flow
dark
blond
hair
that
make
him
go
over
and
start
talk
to
her
craft
who
be
at
bix
with
a
girlfriend
say
he
just
saunter
up
and
introduce
himself
he
told
me
who
he
be
in
the
first
few
minute
but
i
d
never
heard
of
oracle
i
guess
he
sort
of
chat
me
up
i
don
t
know
what
else
you
could
call
it
when
craft
told
him
that
she
be
a
writer
work
on
a
romantic
novel
ellison
brag
that
he
knew
people
whom
she
might
find
interest
and
told
her
that
he
might
be
able
to
find
her
an
agent
push
his
luck
he
suggest
that
maybe
they
should
get
together
sometime
politely
but
firmly
craft
inform
him
that
she
be
engage
and
very
definitely
not
on
the
market
unabashed
ellison
s
next
move
be
to
send
his
driver
carl
olsen
back
to
the
restaurant
with
a
note
the
letter
say
a
little
more
about
himself
include
the
information
that
he
too
be
in
a
serious
relationship
by
coincidence
with
another
writer
craft
say
he
be
try
to
defuse
the
tension
in
the
situation
i
thought
well
this
be
interest
he
know
that
i
m
not
available
for
date
but
he
s
not
go
away
he
s
smart
and
funny
and
there
s
no
reason
why
i
can
t
get
to
know
him
to
be
honest
i
thought
he
d
be
great
material
for
me
i
be
write
romance
novel
with
large
than
life
hero
but
how
often
do
someone
like
me
meet
someone
like
that
in
fact
the
relationship
that
ellison
allude
to
and
that
put
craft
at
her
ease
wasn
t
quite
as
serious
as
he
d
make
out
i
d
be
out
with
this
other
writer
a
few
time
but
i
be
stretch
it
a
bit
to
call
it
a
relationship
craft
be
engage
to
and
living
with
a
young
man
she
have
met
seven

pastry
at
a
bakery
to
support
her
write
ellison
decide
that
the
best
approach
be
patience
whenever
i
be
go
to
a
particularly
great
event
i
d
invite
melanie
one
such
be

story
make
by
steve
job
s
other
company
the
computer
animation
firm
pixar
animation
studio
if
meeting
job
at
a
film
premiere
wasn
t
enough
to
impress
craft
ellison
be
soon
able
to
top
that
invite
to
a
dinner
in
honor
of
president
bill
clinton
by
california
senator
dianne
feinstein

insist
that
craft
go
with
him
ellison
say
we
re
in
this
room
with
the
senator
and
about
forty
other
people
suddenly
without
any
announcement
the
president
appear
in
the
entryway
all
head
turn
toward
the
man
and
everyone
stop
talk
then
in
this
dead
silent
room
the
president
look
right
at
me
and
say
hi
larry
melanie
s
eye
widen
as
the
president
walk
over
and
start
talk
to
us
it
be
perfect
thank
you
mr
president
so
here
i
be
pull
out
all
the
stop
introduce
her
to
the
most
fascinate
people
i
know
steve
job
josh
lederberg
the
president
desperately
try
to
make
some
progress
with
this
woman
but
it
s
not
work
i
mean
she
s
have
a
good
time
when
we
get
together
she
think
my
friend
be
interest
she
think
i
m
interest
but
she
didn
t
want
to
date
me
inexperienced
though
craft
be
it
didn
t
take
a
genius
to
realize
that
ellison
s
interest
in
her
go
far
than
have
someone
cute
on
his
arm
to
accompany
him
to
glitzy
event
but
she
enjoy
his
company
and
reckon
that
if
she
didn
t
respond
he
would
get
over
it
she
be
also
well
aware
that
his
persistent
courtship
didn
t
mean
that
he
wasn
t
see
other
woman
she
say
i
look
him
up
on
the
internet
and
there
be
all
of
this
awful
tabloid
style
press
about
him
it
be
obvious
that
he
wasn
t
living
as
a
monk
but
he
never
make
a
move
on
me
i
think
he
knew
that
it
would
be
the
surest
way
to
make
me
disappear
i
like
him
like
spending
time
with
him
and
i
be
try
hard
to
keep
us
out
of
the
kind
of
confrontational
situation
that
would
force
an
end
to
the
friendship
it
s
funny
in
retrospect
know
him
now
i
d
guess
that
my
unavailability
be
part
of
what
kept
him
interested
in
me
it
s
just
like
they
tell
you
to
behave
in
the
rule
but
i
meant
it
not
only
do
ellison
continue
to
ask
craft
out
he
would
even
ask
her
fianc
as
well
on
one
occasion
invite
both
melanie
and
her
fianc
to
his
annual
garden
party
at
atherton
to
celebrate
the
cherry
blossom
at
the
party
ellison
introduce
him
to
steve
job
afterwards
job
ask
larry
do
you
say
that
guy
be
melanie
s
fianc
what
s
go
on
what
do
you
think
you
re
do
it
s
all
part
of
the
strategy
explain
ellison
strategy
say
job
you
call
this
a
strategy
ellison
say
it
become
sort
of
a
long
run
joke
every
time
steve
saw
me
he
d
ask
how
s
the
melanie
strategy
go
then
he
d
laugh
at
me
he
never
miss
an
opportunity
to
tell
someone
we
both
knew
all
about
it
one
day
i
heard
this
raucous
laughter
come
from
ray
lane
s
office
it
sound
like
there
be
a
fraternity
party

on
in
there
so
i
walk
in
and
there
s
steve
with
ray
they
take
one
look
at
me
and
they
both
start
laugh
again
they
have
be
discuss
the
melanie
strategy
steve
thought
it
be
one
of
the
stupidest
thing
he
d
ever
see
me
have
a
mad
crush
on
this
young
girl
in
fact
even
without
ellison
s
genteel
pursuit
craft
s
relationship
be
already
break
down
when
the
couple
broke
up
ellison
be
there
to
pick
up
the
piece
ellison
say
a
year
and
a
half
after

melanie
i
kiss
her
for
the
first
time
we
be

on
the
couch
in
my

long
after
craft

into
ellison
s
house
on
isabella
avenue
craft
say
when
i
first
met
him
i
thought
he
be
a
suit
in
my
value
system
at
the
time
a
businessman
be
a
big
step
down
from
an
academic
or
an
artistic
type
but
larry
surprised
me
he
s
the
smartest
guy
i
ve
ever
know
the
suit
i
learn
be
his
way
of
give
the
finger
to
that
conformist
casual
dress
code
in
silicon
valley
larry
isn
t
one
for
follow
the
crowd
one
of
the
thing
about
ellison
that
most
impressed
craft
which
may
surprise
some
people
be
his
honesty
he
s
very
truthful
he
say
the
thing
that
other
people
be
afraid
to
say
as
a
woman
i
ve
learn
to
dissemble
but
i
get
pretty
damn
tire
of
it
sometimes
in
him
i
saw
the
personification
of
that
quote
from
shakespeare
while
you
live
tell
truth
and
shame
the
devil
six
year
later
the
relationship
be
still
go
strong
which
mean
that
it
have
already
outlast
all
previous
one
other
than
his
first
marriage
it
seem
to
work
mainly
because
each
have
found
a
way
of
allow
the
other
space
ellison
say
of
craft
she
writes
and
write
be
an
all
consume
solitary
task
if
she
s
not
write
she
s
not
happy
so
she
spends
a
lot
of
her
time
alone
she
do
however
come
out
of
her
room
for
meal
she
say
of
him
he
need
freedom
within
a
stable
framework
but
i
haven
t
always
be
able
to
offer
him
or
anyone
else
either
of
those
thing
i
be
really
young
when
we
met
and
larry
have
have
to
push
me
toward
adulthood
at
time
i
didn
t
always
go
willingly
but
the
end
result
be
that
our
relationship
have
gotten
strong
as
i
ve
gotten
old
and
become
more
focus
on
do
a
good
job
with
my
own
life
it
take
a
lot
of
hard
work
on
both
of
our
part
it
could
easily
have
go
the
other
way
during
what
she
see
as
that
period
of
dependency
craft
be
desperate
for
ellison
to
marry
her
she
say
now
i
push
much
harder
than
i
should
have
i
mean
i
hardly
even
knew
larry
when
i
be
demand
that
i
become
his
wife
it
be
childish
of
me
and
quite
rightly
it
scar
the
hell
out
of
him
at
the
time
i
didn
t
understand
his
history
with
this
issue
and
i
be
angry
with
him
for
be
so
cautious
he
have
to
do
a
careful
balance
act
with
me
he
never
say
no
i
don
t
want
to
marry
you
he
d
say
yes
let
s
do
it
in
the
spring
when
the
cherry
tree
be
blooming
and
then
spring
would
come
closer
and
closer
and
i
d
feel
his
reluctance
it
be
painful
because
i
read
it
as
a
lack
of
love
rather
than
a
lack
of
confidence
i
don
t
feel
that
reluctance
in
him
anymore
but
i
know
thing
now
that
i
didn
t
know
then
i
learn
the
hard
way
that
outside
of
our
friend
and
family
the
world
doesn
t
give
a
fig
about
me
other
than
as
larry

partner
when
i
be
work
lousy
job
dream
of
someday
hit
the
new
york
time

i
sure
didn

foresee
that
the
first
mention
of
my
name
in
print
would
be
in
vanity
fair
as
larry
ellison

in
tight

but
that
s
the
way
thing
work
my
second
book
come
out
in
the
fall
and
i
want
to
have
accomplish
at
least
that
much
before
larry
and
i
go
on
to
the
next
stage
i
know
now
how
easy
it
be
to
get
subsume
i
don
t
think
that
it
would
happen
again
but
i
m
not
as
sure
as
i
d
like
to
be
craft
s
write
may
be
the
savior
of
their
relationship
now
finish
her
third
book
craft
rarely
go
anywhere
without
her
apple
laptop
frequently
tap
away
in
the
back
of
a
limo
or
on
the
plane
when
accompany
ellison
on
business
hunch
over
her
mac
she
seem
to
be
proclaim
that
although
she
s
with
ellison
she
have
a
life
and
identity
that
be
separate
and
distinct
from
his
ellison
say
she
once
read
to
me
from
a
book
about
the
temperament
of
writer
it
say
that
writer
should
never
get
married
because
they
be
so
obsessive
self
possess
and
narcissistic
i
thought
really
me
too
this
just
might
work
ellison
dread
the
kind
of
relationship
in
which
two
people
almost
merge
into
one
the
happier
you
be
with
your
separate
and
independent
life
the
well
your
relationship
be
likely
to
be
our
relationship
be
best
when
her
write
be
go
well
and
thing
be
good
at
oracle
for
all
that
and
the
age
difference
of
which
ellison
be
more
aware
than
craft
they
be
comfortable
with
each
other
return
with
ellison
from
a
business
trip
to
washington
d
c
on
board
the
gv
ellison
suddenly
say
to
me
a
child
be
irreplaceable
you
d
never
trade
your
child
for
a
smarter
more
beautiful
child
your
child
be
part
of
your
family
melanie
s
part
of
my
family
now
maybe
there
s
a
woman
out
there
who
s
smarter
or
well
look
or
whatever
but
it
doesn
t
matter
i
m
not
look
for
something
well
i
m
happy
with
what
i
have
he
go
on
to
say
that
he
have
even
be
think
of
have
child
with
melanie
if
that
be
something
that
she
also
want
to
do
i
d
love
to
have
more
child
but
it
s
completely
her
call
although
the
pressure
at
oracle
be
building
he
seem
very
happy
those
closest
to
ellison
such
as
jimmy
linn
and
steve
job
agree
that
craft
have
be
good
for
him
bring
a
stability
and
constancy
to
his
life
that
be
alarmingly
lack
before
job
say
guy
can
get
an
illness
in
which
they
believe
there
can

next
corner
nick
hornby
in
the
book
high
fidelity
call
it
death
by
small
increment
it
s
a
disease
that
can
get
bad
if
you
re
very
successful
and
you
have
a
great
many
option
but
time
take
option
away
i
remember
chat
with
larry
when
he
be
in
his
date
phase
and
say
you
re
fifty
now
imagine
yourself
when
you
re
sixty
do
this
imagine
yourself
when
you
re
seventy
do
this
it
s
go
to
get
really
fuck
weird
i
think
he
get
that
now
and
the
relationship
with
melanie
be
what
s
finally
get
him
there
but
positive
though
friend
be
about
ellison
s
relationship
with
craft
there
s
a
lurk
fear
that
marriage
and
child
could
alter
something
that
work
on
its
own
term
one
say
he
love
melanie
but
larry
s
a
very
fluid
guy
others
express
skepticism
about
craft
s
apparent
uncertainty
about
whether
to
go
to
the
next
stage
as
she
put
it
suggest
that
she
might
only
want
to
have
child
to
solidify
her
stand
with
larry
others
less
uncharitably
be
just
worried
about
the
damage
that
fail
to
sustain
a
fourth
marriage
might
do
to
their
friend
ellison
and
craft
both
know
that
child
would
change
the
dynamic
of
a
successful
relationship
fundamentally
and
that
s
always
scary
they
wouldn
t
be
the
first
couple
to
decide
that
the
risk
be
simply
too
great
that
they
love
each
other
be
not
in
doubt
but
most
crucially
and
despite
everything
they
both
say
about
the
need
to
give
each
other
space
i
think
they
have
come
to
depend
upon
each
other
there
be
much
about
the
relationship
that
be
difficult
for
craft
the
age
difference
alone
be
a
challenge
ellison
dominates
even
when
he
doesn
t
intend
to
and
he
come
with
quite
a
lot
of
personal
baggage
the
main
reason
however
why
this
relationship
be
more
likely
to
endure
than
the
others
be
the
change
that
have
take
place
within
ellison
himself
as
he
say
i
can
divide
my
life
into
two
phase
the
first
where
i
be
desperately
try
to
be
the
person
i
thought
i
should
be
and
the
second
where
i
finally
accepted
the
person
that
i
really
be
the
second
phase
have
be
much
happier
than
the
first
in
other
word
to
be
capable
of
accept
the
love
of
others
you
first
have
to
love
yourself

ellison
s
preoccupation
with
the
japanese

have
be
trigger
during
a
business
trip
to
japan
in

twenty
when
he
have

where
he
visit
the

standard
it
s
not

it
be
the
first
authentic
japanese
garden
i
d
ever
see
and
it
have
a
profound
effect
on
me
i
spent
five
hour
there
sit
on
a
bench
take
it
all
in
i
like
all

japanese

seem
to
have
be
paint
by
god
the

be
hidden
from

it
s
as
if
you
be
wander
through
a
forest
and
just
happen
upon
a
beautiful
mountain
meadow

the
sight
sound
and
scent
of
a
japanese
garden
trigger
something
deep
inside
of
us
there
s
this
primal
connection
to
the
sound
of
the
water
the
moisture
in
the
air
the
rich
smell
of
pine
needle
and
the

early

would
always

re
create

fill
us
with
a
reassure
sense
of
safety
and
peace
it
s
a
sublime
experience
other
quality
of
the
japanese
aesthetic
also
appeal
to
ellison
the
relatively
small
scale
of
even
the
house
built
for
prince
be
another
aspect
of
its
determination
to
achieve
a
harmonious
relationship
with
nature
very
different
from
great
european
palace
and
the
imitation
erect
by
bombastic
american
tycoon
that
be
design
to
dominate
the
landscape
and
encourage
a
feel
of
awe
ellison
also
like
the
way
the
minimal
interior
reflect
the
simplicity
of
the
garden
outside
he
s
fond
of

your

be
not
complete
until
there
be
nothing
more
you
can
take
out
of
it
above
all
he
prize
the
deliberate
ambiguity
between
outdoors
and
indoors
japanese
house
he
say
be
so
low
to
the

that
when
you
open
the

you
can
put
your

out

come
from

an

resort
in

make
up
of
grass
hut
strung
around
a

where
ellison
have
spent

holiday
with
steve
job
he
say
gradually
the
design
take
shape
i
want
to
have
a
lake
surround
by
a
village
of
small
wooden
building
an
upper
pond
be
to
be
connect
to
the
low
lake
by
a

of

so
that
the

would
be
fill
with
the
sound
of
run

ellison
begin
to
make
sketch
and
build
a
series
of
scale
model
his
collaborator
be
ron
herman
who
have
landscape
the
japanese
style
garden
at
atherton
paul
discoe
an
eccentric
perfectionist
who
in
his
zeal
to
become
a
zen
priest
have
wander
around
japan
often
barefoot
in
the
snow
and
isuke
shigeru
who
spoke
almost
no
english
but
knew
all
about
the
place
of
rock
and
boulder
discoe
be
a
largely
self
taught
architect
who
have
no
engineering
background
but
what
ellison
like
about
him
be
his
passionate
dedication
to
authenticity
after
he
construct
a
perfect
small
teahouse
in
the
ground
of
ellison
s
home
in
atherton
ellison
have
no
hesitation
in
entrust
the
project
to
him
at
time
even
ellison
have
be
startle
by
discoe
s
intensity
he
say
i
learn
to
be
a
little
wary
of
paul
s
zealous
quest
for
authenticity
authenticity
have
its
limit
paul
want
little
itty
bitty
lavatory
hole
in
the
ground
basically
i
prefer
toilet
with
run
water
more
recently
discoe
refuse
to
sink
light
into
the
cedar
ceiling
of
the
house
after
nearly
a
year
of
pressure
from
ellison
hey
guy
gimme
a
break
i
gotta
live
here
it
get
dark
at
night
i
want
light
discoe
relent
but
not
until
he
and
the
carpenter
held
a
small
ceremony
during
which
they
beg
the
forgiveness
of
the
wood
god
for
the
brutality
that
ellison
have
order
to
be
inflict
upon
them
ellison
say
it
be
quite
traumatic
for
them
after
ellison
have
bought
the
land
remove
several
exist
house
in
the
process
and
satisfied
the
local
planning
authority
that
the
lake
and
the
house
would
comply
with
stringent
earthquake
regulation
the
work
could
finally
begin
ellison
go
to
japan
to
recruit
master
carpenter
and
plasterer
the
best
craftsman
in
japan
be
consider
national
treasure
that
s
who
we
hire
the
rest
of
the

an

craftsman
most
of
whom
come
over
from
berkeley
each
day
and
hard

civil

from
the
like
of

the

and
the
lake
to
ensure
that
in
an
earthquake
the
water
wouldn
t
carry
half
of
woodside
down
to
highway
the

to
be
built
with
three
layer
of
concrete
with
a
water
membrane
between
each

ring
the

the
two

the
katsura

the
guest
house
and
the
boathouse
each
of

be
different
in
size
and
character
the
architectural
style
span
from
the
fifteenth
to
the
eighteenth
century
the
idea
say
ellison
be
that
it
should
look
like
a
village
that
have
grown
up
over
time
beneath
the
house
hidden
from
view

the
filtration
system
that
drive
the

replenishes
the

with

a
cinema

for

although
the
overall
effect
be
startlingly
beautiful
and
the
house
look
smell
and
feel
gorgeous
i
still
find
myself
wonder
whether
ellison
and
craft
will
enjoy
living
here
will
the
carefully
contrive
perfection
of
the
place
turn
out
to
be
stifle
will
those
human
scale
house
actually
seem
too
small
once
they
be
occupy
will
the
rigorous
asceticism
of
discoe
deny
them
too
many
creature
comfort
and
technological
convenience
ellison
say
simply
that
if
he
doesn
t
like
it
he
won
t
live
there
but
that
he
can
t
imagine
that
happen

if
sanbashi
seem
like
an
extravagant
fantasy
ellison
s
other
grand
project
be
just
as
ambitious
nothing
less
than
one
of
the
big
and
most
beautiful
private
yacht
in
the
world
ellison
s
first
proper
yacht
be
october
rise
which
he
have
bought
in
from
kirk
kerkorian
for
million
the
foot
october
rise
be
a
gorgeous
boat
but
a
little
too
slow
and
staid
for
ellison
s
taste
a
couple
of
year
later
he
paid
the
widow
of
the
mexican
medium
tycoon
emilio
azcarraga
million
for
one
of
the
fast

ever
built

francis

with

that

an

eco
could
do
more
than
thirty
five
knot
but
for
ellison
that
be
only
the
start
point
he
rename
her
katana
and
pour
another
million
into
her
he
strip
out
her
garish
interior
and
replace
it
with
the
light
wood

picked
up
for

at

and
ready
to
cruise
anywhere
in
the
pacific
with
its
crew
of
fifteen
most
people
might
have
thought
that
ellison
have
as
much
boat
as
any
human
be
could
reasonably
want
but
just
as
living
in
the
pastiche
japanese
villa
at
atherton
have
driven
ellison
to
attempt
a
more
perfect
realization
of
the
japanese
aesthetic
so
the
almost
perfect
katana
drove
him
to
contemplate
what
the
perfect
boat
would
be
like
ellison
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
he
want
he
and
craft
have
decide
that
the
new
boat
would
be
their
second
home
a
place
where
they
would
spend
an
increase
amount
of
time
eventually
as
much
as
three
or
four
month
each
year
for
several
reason
a
much
big
boat
than
katana
be
dictate
the
first
be
that
ellison
want
to
have
space
and
privacy
in
which
to
live
and
work
even
when
he
have
guest
aboard
yet
he
insist
on
a
shape
that
be
low
and
sleek
she
have
to
be
beautiful
and
ultramodern
but
she
must
look
like
a
proper
ship
not
some
ghastly
float
palace
he
say
this
project
will
result
in
the
creation
of
a
wonderful
piece
of
kinetic
sculpture
modern
yacht
pack
as
much
structure
as
possible
on
top
of
the
hull
i
want
just
the
opposite
our
design
waste
space
but
it
have
the
long
low
graceful
line
of
those
beautiful
old
atlantic
steamer
second
he
demand
both
enormous
cruise
range
and
high
speed
katana
achieve
her
speed
thanks
to
her
thirsty
turbine
whereas
ronin
have
a
semiplaning
hull
as
a
consequence
both
be
compromise
the
only
way
to
get
what
he
want
be
by
conventional
diesel
propulsion
and
sheer
length
along
the
waterline
but
who
would
be
the
equivalent
of
discoe
and
shigeru
a
driven
obsessive
who
would
share
and
articulate
ellison
s
vision
ellison
interviewed
just
about
every
major
boat
designer
in
the
world
finally
in
late
he
call
on
jon
bannenberg
an
englishman
in
his
early
seventy
who
work
from
a
studio
just
off
london
s
king
road
more
than
thirty
year
earlier
he
have
design
one
of
the
most
elegant
yacht
ever
built
the
sublime
carinthia
vi
coincidentally
like
discoe
or
maybe
not
bannenberg
have
no
formal
training
he
be
know
for
be
headstrong
and
difficult
to
deal
with
ellison
recall
everyone
told
me
it
be
a
waste
of
time
to
talk
to
jon
they
say
he
never
design
what
the
client
want
just
what
he
want
well
i
wasn
t
happy
with
any
of
the
other
designer
and
i
try
them
all
so
jon
be
my
last
resort
within
five
minute
i
knew
i
have
found
the
right
guy
bannenberg
be
just
what
ellison
have
be
look
for
another
crazy
perfectionist
to
work
with
he
say
people
who
set
incredibly
high
standard
for
their
work
find
it
difficult
to
collaborate
with
people
who
don
t
understand
and
appreciate
their
reckless
pursuit
of
perfection
but
i
love
work
with
these
brilliant
people
with
their
compulsive
personality
i
find
them
interest
and
i
think
i
understand
what
drive
them
i
be
very
lucky
to
find
jon
without
him
i
never
would
have
go
ahead
with
the
project
bannenberg
at
an
age
when
most
men
be
well
into
retirement
have
found
the
perfect
client
somebody
who
share
his
aesthetic
sense
and
who
have
the
wealth
and
ambition
to
inspire
him
to
do
his
very
best
work
to
create
a
masterpiece
that
might
surpass
even
carinthia
right
from
the
begin
bannenberg
realize
that
ellison
would
be
an
exceptional
client
i
have
an
instant
connection
with
larry
through
all
kind
of
philosophical
thing
and
interest
his
interest
in
architecture
the
combination
of
be
a
radical
thinker
yet
a
discipline
one
his
willingness
to
take
on
establishment
idea
and
win
he
be
fascinate
amuse
opinionated
and
very
attractive
bannenberg
on
principle
have
earlier
refuse
to
pitch
for
ellison
s
business
by
take
part
in
a
beauty
contest
with
rival
designer
but
immediately
after
the
meeting
in
london
he
contact
ellison
s
yacht
broker
mel
wood
and
told
him
that
he
would
do
a
draw
and
make
a
model
because
he
be
absolutely
sure
that
he
could
make
ellison
what
he
want
i
didn
t
see
it
as
a
beauty
contest
anymore
he
have
be
inundate
by
design
from
all
these
people
who
thought
that
because
larry
be
so
rich
he
must
want
something
very
elaborate
whereas
what
he
want
be
a
no
nonsense
strip
down
shipshape
powerful
vessel
i
knew
that
i
could
do
it
and
that
nobody
else
could
arrogance
so
that
s
what
i
do
and
of
course
he
go
crazy
over
it
it
be
what
he
have
in
his
mind
but
no
one
else
have
be
able
to
release
it
once
news
get
out
that
the
great
boat
be
go
to
be
built
there
be
the
inevitable
feed
frenzy
among
the
major
shipyard
and
the
committee
of
consultant
who
make
a
fat
living
from
appear
to
manage
such
project
right
from
the
outset
bannenberg
and
ellison
agree
that
they
would
work
differently
bannenberg
believe
there
be
only
one
yard
capable
of
the
work
l
rssens
in
bremen
germany
which
have
built
carinthia
and
that
consultant
would
only
get
in
the
way
bannenberg
point
out
that
l
ssens
have
be
go
for
year
he
say
this
business
be
crazy
enough
as
it
be
it
s
as
if
we
re
building
one
off
handmade
s
with
no
r
and
d
it
help
that
larry
and
i
have
a
hugely
simple
and
powerful
association
larry
doesn
t
demand
endless
work
report
as
long
as
you
re
do
the
job
and
you
don
t
fuck
it
up
one
of
the
great
pleasure
in
my
life
be
that
through
this
work
i
have
met
larry
as
for
where
this
yacht
stand
in
my
life
it
s
not
only
the
great
yacht
that
i
have
ever
built
but
the
great
that
have
ever
be
built
in
the
tradition
of
great
yacht
go
back
to
because
of
its
absolute
purity
of
purpose
there
be
no
question
about
that
although
sayonara
as
she
be
likely
to
be
call
in
honor
of
ellison
s
world
championship
win
maxi
would
not
be
radical
for
the
sake
of
it
the
design
still
call
for
considerable
innovation
the
deck
be
be
built
completely
flush
like
a
sailboat
s
with
all
the
fitting
hidden
to
ensure
that
nothing
extraneous
interfere
with
the
elegant
silhouette
the
swept
back
funnel
would
be
construct
from
titanium
and
carbon
fiber
but
perhaps
the
most
eye
catch
and
technically
demand
feature
would
be
the
glass
wall
around
the
top
two
deck
with
the
yacht
likely
to
tip
the
scale
at
around
ton
the
glass
alone
will
weigh
more
than
ton
inside
bannenberg
have
include
a
glass
in
walkway
across
the
engine
room
from
which
to
observe
the
massive
diesel
hard
at
work
i
ask
bannenberg
what
he
would
say
to
people
who
might
well
regard
a
foot
yacht
for
personal
enjoyment
as
an
obscene
self
indulgence
if
you
start
on
that
road
where
do
it
lead
nobody
need
a
yacht
nobody
need
a
racehorse
nobody
need
art
or
music
or
opera
house
you
don
t
have
to
have
any
of
these
thing
so
what
s
left
people
aren
t
motivate
thank
god
just
by
need
if
human
didn
t
create
thing
they
didn
t
need
there
d
be
no
art
of
any
sort
larry
be
often
portrayed
by
ignorant
philistine
as
just
a
rich
git
who
like
show
off
there
be
people
building
big
yacht
who
just
want
to
show
off
but
larry
s
not
one
of
them
i
encourage
larry
to
think
about
the
worth
of
what
he
s
do
if
a
fine
building
could
be
consider
art
why
not
a
boat
it
be
clear
that
bannenberg
thought
of
ellison
as
a
brave
and
enlighten
patron
and
part
of
ellison
saw
himself
as
an
impresario
create
the
condition
in
which
gift
and
driven
people
could
do
their
very
best
work
after
all
he
have
often
say
that
he
thought
it
quite
likely
that
he
would
be
remember
as
the
man
who
built
sanbashi
rather
than
as
the
founder
of
oracle
but
that
s
not
why
he
do
it
he
built
it
because
he
want
it
just
as
with
the
woodside
project
it
seem
far
more
important
to
make
the
boat
perfect
than
to
make
the
boat
fit
within
a
specific
budget
be
it
a
form
of
madness
probably
no
wonder
bannenberg
be
such
a
happy
man

a
few
month
after
i
met
jon
bannenberg
he
be
diagnose
with
a
brain
tumor
he
die
in
may
although
he
never
saw
his
creation
become
a
physical
reality
his
work
be
largely
complete
and
as
ellison
say
he
saw
it
as
clearly
in
his
mind
as
if
she
have
be
float
at
anchor
outside
his
cramped
studio
when
he
receive
the
news
of
bannenberg
s
death
ellison
e
mail
me
jon
be
one
of
a
handful
of
people
i
like
and
admire
so
much
that
i
make
him
a
role
model
along
with
tom
lantos
and
josh
lederberg
he
be
more
fit
and
vital
in
his
seventy
than
most
people
be
at
thirty
age
fail
to
slow
him
down
until
it
conspire
with
cancer
even
then
jon
work
on
the
project
right
until
the
end
he
never
accepted
there
be
a
problem
he
could
not
solve
or
a
fight
he
could
not
win
i
ll
miss
our
dinner
conversation
about
history
and
human
nature
i
ll
miss
listen
to
him
play
the
piano
i
ll
miss
watch
him
charm
melanie
what
do
you
think
the
creator
have
in
mind
when
he
let
this
happen

in
paul
discoe
and
jon
bannenberg
ellison
have
found
uncompromising
driven
perfectionist
who
share
his
appetite
to
create
something
extraordinary
but
the
person
he
depend
upon
to
make
it
all
work
be
a
san
francisco
base
designer
laura
seccombe
he
have
first
use
seccombe
in
for
corporate
work
even
on
that
first
project
some
thing
be
already
apparent
about
ellison
one
be
that
green
be
his
favorite
color
and
he
want
a
lot
of
green
in
the
building
the
second
be
that
he
have
a
strong
sense
of
visualization
seccombe
say
a
lot
of
client
can
t
see
three
dimensionally
but
larry
can
it
mean
that
when
you
re
explain
something
to
him
that
you
want
to
do
he
get
it
and
remembers
it
after
that
come
a
helter
skelter
of
both
corporate
and
personal
commission
although
seccombe
have
never
work
on
a
private
house
she
be
intrigue
enough
by
what
ellison
want
to
achieve
with
his
newly
purchase
japanese
style
villa
in
atherton
to
leave
her
architectural
practice
and
set
up
her
own
firm
when
oracle
move
from
davis
drive
to
redwood
shore
in
it
be
seccombe
and
ellison
who
between
them
create
the
look
of
the
new
campus
whose
gleam
cylindrical
tower
today
dominate
the
flat
bay
area
landscape
and
as
she
say
make
a
very
powerful
and
sophisticated
statement
of
the
interior
she
say
larry
want
an
environment
that
would
boost
morale
so
he
be
adamant
that
everything
have
to
be
do
to
a
certain
level
of
quality
during
oracle
s
crisis
in
the
early
s
the
extravagance
of
the
campus
with
its
square
foot
gym
manicure
garden
and
ornamental
lake
be
use
as
a
stick
to
beat
ellison
with
but
seccombe
believe
that
his
commitment
to
quality
have
contribute
to
oracle
s
subsequent
success
she
say
he
s
unique
in
the
industry
both
for
his
involvement
and
concern
for
aesthetic
a
very
different
domestic
project
from
ellison
s
home
at
atherton
be
the
house
he
bought
in
in
san
francisco
s
pacific
height
design
by
the
celebrate
architect
bill
wurster
toward
the
end
of
his
life
for
heir
of
the
spreckels
sugar
dynasty
the
house
occupies
a
spectacular
position
on
broadway
look
out
across
the
bay
toward
sausalito
with
the
golden
gate
bridge
to
the
left
alcatraz
to
the
right
after
much
negotiation
with
the
city
authority
who
consider
it
a
historic
building
ellison
won
permission
to
open
up
the
whole
of
the
back
facade
essentially
create
a
single
glass
wall
extend
over
four
floor
inside
ellison
want
a
highly
modern
ultraminimalist
look
although
conceptually
far
remove
from
his
home
in
atherton
accord
to
seccombe
the
house
have
one
thing
in
common
in
both
what
lay
outside
be
what
matter
most
in
one
the
garden
in
the
other
the
extraordinary
view
seccombe
have
also
redesign
the
interior
of
both
ronin
and
katana
so
it
be
natural
for
her
to
work
with
jon
bannenberg
from
the
outset
visualize
and
design
interior
space
that
would
match
the
drama
of
bannenberg
s
naval
architecture
however
ellison
deliberately
kept
her
away
from
paul
discoe
and
sanbashi
until
the
project
be
near
completion
but
with
about
eighteen
month
to
go
before
he
be
due
to
move
in
he
ask
her
to
get
involve
any
earlier
and
she
would
inevitably
have
clashed
with
discoe
demand
compromise
that
would
have
dilute
the
purity
of
his
approach
any
later
and
it
might
have
be
impossible
to
make
the
compromise
require
for
ellison
actually
to
be
able
to
live
there
i
sense
that
seccombe
be
troubled
by
sanbashi
although
that
may
just
have
be
the
understandable
tension
that
exist
between
her
and
discoe
and
the
fact
that
she
felt
she
have
be
brought
in
to
fix
something
that
be
not
her
creation
she
be
much
more
enthusiastic
about
the
collaboration
with
bannenberg
when
larry
first
talk
to
me
about
it
he
say
he
want
it
to
be
like
a
float
broadway
it
will
have
the
same
discipline
as
broadway
thing
will
only
be
there
because
they
be
functional
or
beautiful
and
absolutely
correct
it
s
what
you
take
away
that
make
it
perfect

in
june
ellison
flew
to
london
from
bremen
in
his
brand
new
bombardier
global
express
a
million
replacement
for
the
narrower
body
gv
because
of

and
bannenberg
s
death
it
be
his
first
visit
to
the

since
work
on
the

problem
with

have
delayed
the
project
and
delivery
be
now
unlikely
until
what
s
she
like
i
ask
him
big
say
ellison
she
s
very
big
it
seem
like
a
curiously
flat
answer
and
i
say
so
ellison
sigh
and
say
yes
the
boat
be
very
beautiful
a
kinetic
sculpture
make
of
metal

but
in
a
post

it

excessive
now
everything
that
s
not
essential
seem
excessive
building

beautiful
boat
have
lose
their
place
in
the
dangerous
new
world
we
live
in
they
no
longer
promise
an
escape
from
the

there
be
no
escape
anymore
ellison
in
common
with
more
than
a

the
kickback
against
corporate
greed

the

cross
scandal

be
still

nobody

that
there

that
the

profitable
its
stock

still
bumping
along
the
bottom
and
ellison
have
be
through
a
torrid
couple
of
month
during
a
pitch
political
battle
in
california
over
an
oracle
software
licensing
deal
he
say
everyone
s
so
angry
about
all
the
money
they
lose
people
feel
they
be
cheat
and
some
be
but
we
need
to
be
careful
about
separate
the
guilty
from
the
innocent
before
we
start
march
people
off
to
the
guillotine
in
other
word
the
great
project
that
ellison
have
embark
upon
with
such
confidence
and
optimism
during
tech
s
roar
ninety
now
struck
him
as
excessive
and
out
of
time
ellison
have
be
through
a
rough
couple
month
but
somehow
i
didn
t
think
his
gloom
would
last
too
long
it
be
more
worry
that
for
the
first
time
he
seem
to
be
bending
his
knee
to
political
correctness
that
probably
wouldn
t
last
either

when
joshua
lederberg
address
a
stanford
university
symposium
in
he
didn
t
notice
larry
ellison
nor
be
it
likely
that
he
would
have
know
who
he
be
the
molecular
biologist
have
left
stanford
in
after
run
the
genetics
department
for
some
nineteen
year
but
often
return
to
see
old
friend
and
engage
in
seminar
and
workshop
he
have
also
have
a
fruitful
collaboration
with
the

renowned
computer

lederberg
have
long
be
interested
in
the
way
in
which
computer
could
help
in
the
planning
of

after
give
his

lederberg
receive
a
note
from
ellison
explain
who
he
be
and
suggest
that
they
meet
up
sometime
as
they
have
some
share
interest
in
the
event
it
be
nearly
two
year
before
they

together
lederberg
live
in

where
he
be
president
of
rockefeller

and
ellison
have
be
fight
for
his
business
life
when
finally
they
met
at
ellison
s
home
on

that
developed

the

of

prize

and
the
brash
silicon
valley
entrepreneur
today
approach
eighty
lederberg
conforms
perfectly
to
the
popular
idea
of
the
distinguish
polymath
sartorially
dishevel
with
a
great
grizzle
head
he
speaks
softly
but
with
great
precision
and
deliberation
you
sense
not
just
intellectual
power
but
considerable
moral
force
there
be
something
almost
prophetic
about
him
what
be
lederberg
s
first
impression
of
ellison
i
knew
nothing
about
the
difficulty
that
oracle
have
be
through
he
just
seem
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
smartest
people
i
d
ever
met
someone
who
be
really
fire
up
about
what
i
consider
to
be
a
revolution
in
human
communication
as
important
as
the
printing
press
after
a
couple
of
meeting
ellison
say
to
lederberg
here
s
the
key
to
my
house
if
you
stay
anywhere
else
when
you
re
out
here
i
ll
be
very
annoyed
though
take
him
up
on
his
offer
lederberg
be
struck
by
the
contrast
between
ellison
s
beautiful
house
and
the
relatively
frugal
and
even
rather
lonely
life
he
seem
to
live
there
and
while
ellison
would
frequently
return
late
in
the
even
ostensibly
from
oracle
their
wide
range
discussion
almost
never
touch
on
anything
that
be
go
on
at
redwood
shore
oracle
and
girlfriend
have
compartment
in
ellison
s
life
and
so
do
nobel
prize
winner
as
far
as
lederberg
could
see
ellison
s
interest
in
molecular
biology
be
purely
intellectual
he
say
i
didn
t
see
him
invest
or
get
practically
involve
i
have
any
number
of
connection
with
biotech
company
and
i
thought
i
d
be
do
him
a
favor
to
mention
some
but
he
didn
t
seem
to
bite
on
any
of
those
suggestion
lederberg
and
ellison
didn
t
talk
only
about
computer
and
gene
lederberg
be
deeply
involve
in
foreign
and
domestic
policy
and
he
found
some
of
ellison
s
view
about
the
ability
of
technology
and
military
force
to
solve
problem
somewhat
simplistic
gently
he
would
suggest
that
maybe
thing
be
a
little
more
complicate
than
ellison
have
assume
force
sometimes
have
to
be
use
sparingly
and
technology
would
not
automatically
benefit
the
poor
unless
capitalism
be
temper
with
some
humanity
lederberg
observes
dryly
larry
be
usually
ready
for
some
modulation
when
we
get
into
the
detail
ellison
s
willingness
to
learn
from
lederberg
wasn
t
just
confine
to
late
night
intellectual
schmooze
in
the
summer
of
ellison
spent
a
fortnight
s
vacation
in
lederberg
s
lab
work
as
a
humble
technician
he
get
his
hand
dirty
and
enjoy
it
very
much
he
participate
in
our
day
to
day
discussion
about
how
the
experiment
be
be
plan
and
the
significance
of
the
information
we
be
get
from
them
within
two
or
three
day
he
d
caught
up
enough
to
be
able
to
play
a
real
part
he
have
a
very
avid
quick
mind
i
think
the
experience
help
to
confirm
his
interest
in
this
field
and
i
begin
to
hear
more
and
more
from
him
about
what
be
go
on
in
other
area
soon
afterward
lederberg
felt
confident
enough
of
ellison
s
seriousness
and
his
friendship
to
ask
him
what
he
want
to
do
with
his
money
from
a
philanthropic
point
of
view
he
have
just
retire
from
rockefeller
university
so
there
be
no
question
of
put
the
bite
on
ellison
for
his
own
institution
he
be
convince
however
that
ellison
be
ready
to
listen
to
some
idea
lederberg
say
i
knew
something
about
philanthropic
investment
what
work
and
what
doesn
t
what
can
really
produce
some
serious
return
and
how
to
organize
it
lederberg
be
careful
not
to
put
ellison
under
any
pressure
but
after
a
series
of
conversation
the
idea
form
for
ellison
to
endow
a
medical
research
foundation
for
year
ellison
have
be
preoccupy
with
gain
a
well
understand
of
cancer
the
disease
that
have
claimed
the
life
of
his
two
mother
and
his
oracle
cofounder
bob
miner
give
the
speed
at
which
medical
science
have
be
move
in
other
area
ellison
thought
that
real
progress
in
combat
cancer
have
be
pretty
dismal
lederberg
s
prompt
could
not
have
come
at
a
well
time
have
survive
oracle
s
recent
trauma
and
crush
most
of
its
database
competition
with
oracle
ellison
be
convince
that
his
company
would
now
be
able
to
handle
whatever
commercial
rival
or
the
economy
threw
at
it
for
ellison
personally
there
be
two
consequence
the
first
be
that
he
be
start
to
get
accustom
to
the
idea
that
he
be
not
only
extremely
wealthy
but
highly
likely
to
stay
that
way
the
second
be
that
he
be
ready
for
new
challenge
ellison
say
i
d
always
be
curious
about
the
fundamental
mechanism
of
molecular
biology
and
now
i
have
this
big
lever
lot
of
money
that
enable
me
to
influence
the
direction
the
research
be
go
for
ellison
simply
write
check
to
good
cause
be
never
an
attractive
option
always
distrustful
of
conventional
altruism
ellison
need
to
develop
a
version
of
philanthropy
that
would
work
for
him
he
say
i
really
can
t
distinguish
my
approach
to
philanthropy
from
my
approach
to
anything
else
i
take
seriously
it
s
about
discover
my
own
limit
and
learn
about
what
it
mean
to
be
alive
i
set
goal
and
live
my
life
in
hot
pursuit
of
them
i
want
to
win
the
america
s
cup
i
want
oracle
to
be
number
one
in
software
i
want
to
help
find
cure
for
cancer
the
america
s
cup
be
just
a
silly
game
nevertheless
i
work
at
it
oracle
s
an
important
business
so
i
work
much
harder
at
that
but
you
know
pursue
cure
for
cancer
be
incomparably
more
interest
and
much
more
important
than
any
of
my
other
goal
so
maybe
that
s
what
i
should
focus
the
rest
of
my
life
on
as
far
as
i
can
tell
living
large
mean
work
on
the
most
interest
and
important
problem
and
there
be
another
thing
ellison
s
lack
of
religious
belief
contribute
strongly
to
his
sense
of
waste
when
a
life
be
cut
short
by
premature
death
or
debilitate
illness
fundamentally
he
say
life
be
the
only
miracle
and
understand
how
life
work
be
the
most
interest
mystery
remain
to
be
solve
it
s
typically
quixotic
of
ellison
to
characterize
his
philanthropy
as
a
dramatic
personal
quest
to
discover
a
cure
for
cancer
in
an
interview
with
fortune
magazine
publish
in
august
the
first
in
which
he
drew
public
attention
to
his
philanthropic
activity
ellison
be
careful
to
distinguish
between
the
work
of
his
medical
foundation
which
be
primarily
concerned
with
disease
related
to
age
and
his
investment
in
the
privately
held
quark
biotech
a
commercial
company
whose
research
may
revolutionize
the
treatment
of
various
cancer
but
ellison
go
on
someone
ask
me
once
how
much
i
would
pay
to
cure
cancer
if
i
could
and
i
reply
everything
i
ve
get
what
do
you
think
be
cooler
be
the
richest
guy
on
earth
or
help
find
the
cure
for
cancer
what
would
you
want
to
do
that
s
a
pretty
easy
question
let
me
nail
the
big
c
it
left
the
reader
with
the
rather
mislead
impression
that
cancer
research
be
the
primary
recipient
of
his
philanthropy
ellison
add
another
rider
to
his
definition
of
philanthropy
that
he
suggests
differentiates
it
from
not
coincidentally
the
work
of
the
bill
melinda
gate
foundation
he
argues
that
the
only
thing
that
matter
be
result
whether
any
life
be
save
until
you
can
say
that
a
certain
proven
lifesaving
drug
exists
only
because
of
research
that
would
not
have
be
fund
without
your
money
it
s
best
not
to
say
anything
at
all
ellison
say
we
measure
philanthropy
and
philanthropist
with
the
wrong
yardstick
it
s
not
the
size
of
the
investment
as
measure
in
dollar
contribute
it
s
the
size
of
the
return
as
measure
in

what
we
should

what
good
it
be
to
write
a
check
for
million
if
the
money
be
waste
it
may
make
you
feel
good
but
you
didn

help
anybody
money
and
motif
grab
a

of
attention
but
i
don
t
think
you
can
climb
into
a

soul
and
understand
their
motif
the

be
how

how
many

do
you
provide
it
s
hard
to
say
how
much
of
this
joshua
lederberg
or
deep
down
ellison
himself
agrees
with
it
do
however
provide
ellison
with
a
kind
of
shield
against
question
of
motive
and
comparison
between
him
and
gate
who
have
undoubtedly
commit
great
sum
of
money
to
medical
research
than
ellison
for
the
record
ellison
have
commit
million
to
his
own
foundation
since
it
begin
in
and
he
s
make
it
clear
to
lederberg
that
as
the
number
of
sponsor
research
project
grows
the
funding
will
expand
to
meet
the
demand
but
it
go
deeper
than
the
slightly
absurd
rivalry
with
gate
ellison
can
t
bear
the
idea
of
be
categorize
as
simply
a
rich
man
with
a
simple
desire
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
even
his
philanthropy
have
to
be
judged
by
rule
that
don
t
apply
to
others
it
also
come
back
to
his
suspicion
of
altruism
and
the
baggage
of
political
correctness
that
these
day
often
accompanies
it
god
won
t
grant
you
absolution
just
because
you
write
a
few
check
he
say
whatever
ellison
s
eccentricity
as
a
philanthropist
lederberg
s
influence
as
chairman
of
the
ellison
medical
foundation
have
be
powerfully
present
in
set
its
goal
lederberg
have
a
strong
sense
of
how
philanthropic
fund
should
be
use
in
contrast
to
investment
which
expect
an
economic
return
or
the
aid
that
government
should
give
on
behalf
of
taxpayer
for
example
if
the
only
concern
be
a
straightforward
cost
benefit
analysis
of
the
best
way
to
save
life
there
s
not
much
doubt
that
put
money
into
well
sanitation
and
clean
drinking
water
in
the
third
world
would
be
the
way
to
go
but
both
lederberg
and
ellison
believe
that
such
uncontroversial
project
which
simply
require
money
and
management
be
the
role
of
government
and
aid
agency
rather
than
individual
however
wealthy
ellison
who
unlike
many
rich
men
have
no
objection
to
pay
high
tax
say
high
tax
don
t
bother
me
at
all
so
long
as
government
spend
the
money
efficiently
on
project
that
make
the
world
a
well
safer
place
unfortunately
most
government
agency
be
quite
inefficient
so
an
awful
lot
of
the
money
they
spend
be
waste
from
the
outset
lederberg
counsel
ellison
against
see
the
emf
as
a
vehicle
for
wag
a
personal
war
against
the
big
c
he
say
find
a
cure
to
cancer
be
not
go
to
happen
in
any
one
step
cancer
be
a
lot
of
disease
although
there
may
be
conceptual
approach
that
be
share
in
a
number
of
area
i
think
there
will
be
incremental
success
from
time
to
time
however
in
twenty
year
time
there
will
still
be
a
lot
of
cancer
albeit
not
the
same
one
that
we
see
today
but
the
main
thing
be
that
cancer
be
probably
the
most
heavily
invest
area
in
biomedicine
it
s
actually
very
hard
to
find
new
niche
for
an
investment
in
cancer
which
isn
t
to
say
that
if
an
idea
be
present
to
us
that
we
be
convince
be
hot
and
for
some
reason
wasn
t
acceptable
to
other
funding
source
we
wouldn
t
support
it
but
we
decide
against
actively
solicit
in
cancer
the
same
be
true
of
aid
another
illness
that
doesn
t
lack
for
private
sector
fund
the
decision
be
make
to
focus
the
emf
on
disease
that
be
related
to
age
an
oddly
unfashionable
area
of
research
despite
the
fact
that
we
be
all
living
longer
and
increasingly
susceptible
to
such
illness
our
golden
year
may
turn
out
to
be
more
of
a
curse
than
a
blessing
and
the
cost
of
care
for
the
sick
elderly
be
in
danger
of
bankrupting
social
security
system
ellison
say
the
longer
you
live
the
more
likely
it
be
that
you
ll
get
one
of
the
common
disease
of
age
alzheimer
s
osteoporosis
parkinson
s
and
so
on
but
because
health
care
have
improve
these
disease
no
longer
kill
you
right
away
that
s
the
good
news
but
a
longer
life
span
come
at
a
very
high
price
high
health
care
cost
and
extend
period
of
human
suffer
the
only
way
to
avoid
pay
this
price
be
to
find
cure
for
these
disease
cure
be
vastly
more
humane
and
much
more
economical
than
care
care
for
a
family
member
with
alzheimer
s
osteoporosis
or
parkinson
s
can
be
financially
and
emotionally
exhaust
unless
we
cure
these
disease
they
ll
devastate
our
family
and
destroy
our
health
care
system
one
of
thing
that
have
rile
ellison
be
the
perception
stimulate
by
speculative
newspaper
article
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
emf
be
to
give
its
benefactor
early
access
to
treatment
that
will
extend
his
own
life
a
typical
example
appear
recently
in
the
san
jose
mercury
news
it
suggest
that
because
ellison
be
know
for
react
badly
to
the
death
of
love
one
appear
in
good
shape
for
his
age
and
be
an
active
sportsman
it
follow
that
he
be
pour
his
billion
into
seek
the
fountain
of
youth
the
piece
even
manage
to
chuck
in
a
reference
to
the
age
discrimination
case
brought
against
oracle
by
randy
baker
as
far
evidence
that
ellison
have
a
horror
of
old
age
ellison
say
our
medical
foundation
have
marshal
so
many
magnificent
mind
and
commit
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
in
an
attempt
to
well
understand
the
fundamental
biology
underlie
the
disease
of
age
and
somehow
the
san
jose
mercury
found
a
way
to
write
a
negative
story
about
it
i
think
that
say
a
lot
more
about
the
mercury
than
my
medical
foundation
he
do
however
agree
that
humanitarian
issue
as
well
as
economic
one
be
at
stake
and
that
his
own
experience
have
affected
him
disease
of
age
and
i
consider
many
cancer
to
be
disease
of
age
hit
hard
at
most
of
our
family
my
mother
die
of
leukemia
my
brother
in
law
get
parkinson
s
it
be
awful
to
watch
his
body
tremble
and
the
personality
i
knew
so
well
just
slowly
disappear
lederberg
simply
observes
that
the
time
scale
involve
in
bring
primary
research
from
the
lab
even
to
the
product
test
stage
be
unlikely
to
be
of
much
personal
benefit
to
someone
of
ellison
s
age
if
there
be
a
criticism
it
be
that
the
disease
that
the
emf
be
focus
on
be
predominantly
those
of
the
rich
in
poor
country
with
low
life
expectancy
they
be
simply
far
less
prevalent
than
other
killer
lederberg
and
ellison
answer
the
question
in
different
way
lederberg
argues
that
once
people
in
the
third
world
have
surmount
the
peril
of
early
childhood
and
assume
they
don
t
fall
victim
to
violence
or
aid
life
expectancy
be
not
as
different
as
the
statistic
suggest
this
be
something
that
s
share
by
the
whole
of
mankind
not
just
the
rich
ellison
point
out
that
one
of
the
result
of
lavish
expensive
care
on
an
age
population
that
vote
be
that
there
s
less
money
available
for
program
for
the
poor
in
the
intensify
competition
for
resource
the
education
of
inner
city
child
drop
to
the
bottom
of
the
list
that
say
the
ellison
medical
foundation
have
now
add
research
into
infectious
disease
of
the
third
world
to
its
dossier
one
of
lederberg
s
preoccupation
be
that
too
many
treatment
for
many
disease
above
all
aid
be
simply
too
expensive
for
people
in
poor
country
and
that
drug
company
be
unwilling
to
invest
in
those
market
because
the
people
be
too
poor
to
buy
the
medicine
you
have
to
find
another
approach
it
s
not
intrinsically
necessary
that
a
treatment
for
hiv
have
to
cost
a
year
we
should
be
make
long
term
gamble
in
the
direction
of
produce
treatment
for
tuberculosis
and
malaria
and
so
on
that
be
above
all
affordable
one
thing
that
may
have
held
the
emf
back
a
little
be
the
relative
lack
of
publicity
it
have
receive
because
of
ellison
s
uncharacteristic
decision
not
to
brag
about
the
work
it
be
funding
until
something
concrete
have
be
achieve
an
approach
he
contrast
with
the
publicity
machine
that
broadcast
the
beneficence
of
the
gate
foundation
but
as
word
have
gotten
out
so
have
the
number
of
research
project
now
run
into
hundred
each
year
be
submit
for
sponsorship
to
lederberg
richard
sprott
the
former
director
of
the
biology
of
age
program
at
the
national
institute
of
age
who
be
hire
to
run
the
foundation
and
its
superdistinguished
science
advisory
board
sab
for
lederberg
the
only
disappointment
have
be
the
difficulty
of
get
ellison
involve
in
a
more
hand
on
role
lederberg
say
i
ve
try
very
hard
to
get
larry
to
engage
in
sab
meeting
but
his
time
commitment
have
make
it
impossible
although
ellison
have
talk
about
make
up
to
billion
available
over
time
you
sense
that
lederberg
would
be
more
confident
about
the
future
if
ellison
be
just
a
little
more
engage
we
ll
have
other
option
to
present
to
him
to
add
to
age
and
infectious
disease
in
a
couple
of
year
but
these
be
all
open
question
if
i
could
count
on
his
interest
in
double
the
foundation
every
three
or
four
year
larry
will
become
the
country
s
major
philanthropist
in
the
biomedical
area
ellison
say
simply
that
if
lederberg
believe
that
there
be
project
that
should
be
fund
they
will
be
two
other
scheme
may
compete
with
the
medical
foundation
for
resource
the
first
be
a
million
project
to
found
a
school
to
study
the
impact
of
technology
on
politics
and
economics
ellison
would
like
to
see
the
pet
politics
economics
technology
school
investigate
the
interaction
between
technologically
extend
life
expectancy
social
security
spending
and
the
competition
between
social
group
for
scarce
public
sector
resource
ellison
have
approach
stanford
harvard
and
mit
but
he
have
discover
that
try
to
do
anything
genuinely
interdisciplinary
be
hellishly
difficult
at
institution
that
aren
t
set
up
to
run
that
way
one
possibility
be
to
make
it
a
freestanding
institution
but
it
currently
seem
more
likely
that
if
the
pet
school
happens
at
all
it
will
be
on
a
much
more
modest
scale
than
originally
contemplate
the
second
idea
a
research
university
focus
on
biology
which
have
lederberg
s
fingerprint
all
over
it
reflect
some
of
ellison
s
suspicion
of
conventional
academic
institution
ellison
believe
that
one
of
the
major
problem
in
get
potentially
lifesaving
idea
to
market
be
the
squabble
between
researcher
and
their
sponsor
university
when
there
be
money
to
be
make
from
the
exploitation
of
a
patent
ellison
say
within
a
traditional
university
there
s
a
lot
of
ambiguity
about
the
ownership
of
intellectual
property
who
own
the
patent
the
researcher
or
the
university
who
get
the
royalty
so
i
m
think
of
start
a
research
university
that
enables
scientist
to
pursue
their
idea
patent
them
and
even
create
company
on
the
outside
to
commercialize
their
idea
if
that
s
what
they
want
to
do
i
want
to
break
down
the
remain
wall
between
university
research
department
and
commercial
biotechnology
company
hopefully
that
will
allow
new
drug
to
come
to
market
more
quickly
life
will
be
save
and
fortune
will
be
make
patient
will
get
healthy
and
professor
will
get
rich
a
perfect
marriage
of
humanitarian
ideal
and
market
incentive
human
nature
at
its
very
best
what
ellison
be
now
think
of
be
something
like
a
rockefeller
west
something
akin
to
the
university
in
new
york
that
lederberg
use
to
run
but
base
in
or
around
san
francisco
and
dedicate
to
biotech
research
combine
a
standard
no
haggle
split
of

and

into
existence
seem
to
him
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
the
crossover
from
lab
to
market
would
happen
faster
there
than
anywhere
else
ellison
quip
the
medical
foundation
and
the
research
university
will
get
ninety
five
percent
of
what
i
earn
in
my
lifetime
i
don
t
think
they
ll
have
any
problem
spending
it
either
they
ll
also
get
most
of
his
time
he
say
once
i
ve
complete
the
earn
portion
of
my
life
i
ll
have
the
time
to
get
deeply
involve
in
the
operation
of
both
of
these
institution
that
should
begin
to
happen
three
to
five
year
from
now
as
i
start
to
disengage
from
oracle
his
impatience
with
academia
and
his
own
ambivalence
toward
the
philanthropic
ethic
may
also
help
explain
why
ellison
talk
about
quark
biotech
inc
qbi
with
great
excitement
than
he
do
about
his
medical
foundation
despite
the
dazzle
work
be
do
there
although
it
be
incorporate
in
california
qbi
be
an
israeli
company
and
ellison
although
not
a
practice
jew
have
something
of
a
love
affair
with
israel
admire
its
steely
pragmatism
respect
for
intellect
and
ingrain
entrepreneurialism
have
own
percent
of
the
company
since
represent
an
investment
of
about
million
he
feel
even
more
responsible
for
it
than
for
the
medical
foundation
finally
the
fact
that
qbi
be
work
on
drug
that
have
the
potential
to
produce
dramatic
improvement
in
cancer
treatment
provide
a
different
order
of
excitement
for
ellison
and
while
quark
s
long
term
projection
be
daunt
for
ordinary
investor
and
the
odds
against
hit
the
jackpot
be
long
the
possibility
that
quark
could
win
big
only
add
spice
to
the
game
ellison
doesn
t
disagree
but
add
the
time
frame
be
pretty
long
at
qbi
because
the
whole
drug
approval
process
be
such
a
drawn
out
business
but
they
ll
deliver
lifesaving
drug
sooner
than
the
research
be
do
by
the
medical
foundation
that
s
why
i
m
so
excite
about
qbi
if
i
judge
myself
on
the
number
of
life
save
most
likely
they
ll
be
the
first
to
deliver
i
guess
it
s
just
another
example
of
my
own
impatience
and
immaturity
qbi
be
develop
both
therapeutic
drug
and
diagnostic
test
one
test
screen
a
patient
s
dna
to
see
if
that
person
be
especially
sensitive
to
radiation
there
s
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
that
should
not
be
expose
to
radiation
of
any
type
not
even
dental
x
ray
unfortunately
there
s
no
simple
test
to
identify
these
people
so
qbi
be
develop
one
well
if
you
can
identify
people
who
should
avoid
radiation
you
should
also
be
able
to
identify
people
who
should
avoid
take
a
particular
drug
that
would
be
harmful
to
them
it
turn
out
that
there
be
numerous
drug
that
have
be
proven
to
be
very
effective
at
treat
a
disease
but
the
drug
fails
the
clinical
trial
because
it
s
toxic
to
some
people
now
by
look
at
the
dna
and
the
clinical
outcome
of
everyone
who
take
the
drug
it
cure
you
it
kill
you
it
do
nothing
we
should
be
able
to
identify
the
people
this
drug
be
likely
help
and
screen
out
the
people
the
drug
be
likely
to
hurt
it
s
call
drug
personalization
it
s
sort
of
like
how
amazon
com
can
look
at
all
the
book
you
ve
previously
read
to
recommend
a
new
one
for
you
except
we
look
at
your
gene
and
recommend
the
right
drug
for
you
it
s
a
monumental
breakthrough
because
it
enables
not
just
one
new
treatment
but
thousand
of
new
treatment
that
previously
fail
their
clinical
trial
another
technology
know
as
the
pft
pifithrin
compound
be
pioneer
by
qbi
be
design
to
make
exist
cancer
treatment
exponentially
more
effective
while
reduce
their
damage
side
effect
ellison
say
the
most
common
form
of
cancer
therapy
be
radiation
and
chemotherapy
unfortunately
when
you
use
either
one
of
these
to
kill
cancer
cell
there
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
collateral
damage
to
healthy
cell
that
be
large
number
of
healthy
cell
die
along
with
the
target
cancer
cell
it
s
the
death
of
these
healthy
cell
that
cause
the
terrible
side
effect
that
accompany
most
form
of
cancer
therapy
the
healthy
cell
die
because
the
radiation
or
chemotherapy
damage
their
dna
which
in
turn
cause
the
cell
to
commit
suicide
through
a
process
call
apoptosis
or
programmed
cell
death
when
healthy
cell
detect
that
they
have
dna
damage
they
increase
the
production
of
their
p
gene
the
p
gene
be
the
primary
molecular
mechanism
that
induces
programmed
cell
death
in
normal
healthy
cell
interestingly
the
p
gene
be
broken
in
most
cancer
cell
so
cancer
cell
will
not
commit
suicide
that
make
cancer
therapy
very
difficult
cancer
cell
be
much
harder
to
kill
than
healthy
cell
because
healthy
cell
have
a
work
suicide
mechanism
and
cancer
cell
don
t
qbi
solve
this
problem
by
develop
a
drug
that
turn
off
the
p
gene
in
all
cell
for
a
few
hour
during
and
after
radiation
or
chemotherapy
that
eliminates
most
of
the
collateral
damage
to
healthy
cell
thus
eliminate
most
of
the
side
effect
even
well
this
enables
the
physician
to
go
after
the
cancer
more
aggressively
by
increase
the
dosage
of
radiation
and
chemotherapy
without
damage
too
many
healthy
cell
we
ve
test
up
to
ten
time
the
lethal
dosage
of
radiation
with
minimum
ill
effect
on
healthy
cell
so
the
quark
compound
flip
off
the
p
gene
for
a
couple
of
hour
and
death
take
a
holiday
it
s
a
very
big
deal
a
big
deal
indeed
but
unfortunately
quark
have
itself
fall
foul
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
s
fda
s
approval
process
with
pft
ellison
admits
that
qbi
wasn
t
sufficiently
rigorous
in
its
preclinical
trial
with
the
result
that
almost
two
year
may
have
be
lose
but
he
s
perplexed
by
an
approval
process
that
be
so
ultracautious
that
it
can
allow
many
people
to
die
by
deny
them
a
new
wonder
drug
because
a
handful
of
patient
may
suffer
an
adverse
reaction
the
fda
and
our
legal
system
work
hand
in
hand
to
virtually
eliminate
error
of
commission
unfortunately
this
lead
to
a
dramatic
increase
in
error
of
omission
here
s
why
if
a
drug
save
a
thousand
life
for
every
one
person
it
kill
the
drug
be
not
likely
to
be
approve
you
can
t
get
sue
for
not
release
a
drug
that
would
have
save
a
thousand
people
you
can
and
will
get
sue
for
release
a
drug
that
kill
one
person
it
s
pretty
bad
math
and
bad
ethic
if
you
ask
me
quark
may
have
few
than
people
on
its
payroll
but
about
of
its
employee
have
a
ph
d
in
molecular
and
cell
biology
gene
discovery
signal
transduction
pathology
chemistry
or
medicinal
chemistry
in
addition
it
employ
more
than
specialist
in
dna
and
protein
analysis
algorithm
development
program
and
statistic
in
what
it
call
its
bioinformatics
group
lederberg
who
sits
on
the
board
say
they
re
brilliant
that
s
the
only
word
to
describe
them
whether
qbi
will
add
up
to
a
single
coherent
business
be
a
little
less
obvious
to
me
but
some
of
the
thing
they
re
work
on
could
turn
out
to
be
real
blockbuster
ellison
have
constantly
reiterate
that
biomedicine
will
be
his
second
career
it
s
consistent
with
his
belief
that
the
computer
industry
be
mature
and
consolidate
that
the
great
platform
shift
that
require
technology
visionary
be
now
thanks
to
the
internet
a
thing
of
the
past
that
the
few
survive
computer
company
include
oracle
will
increasingly
take
on
the
character
of
business
utility
in
short
ellison
think
that
biotech
not
only
be
the
area
that
will
best
leverage
his
money
for
the
good
of
mankind
although
he
d
never
put
it
quite
so
portentously
but
be
also
where
he
s
likely
to
get
the
most
intellectual
stimulation
and
the
most
fun
don
lucas
who
know
as
well
as
anyone
what
make
ellison
tick
hope
more
than
anything
that
he
won
t
leave
it
too
late
until
his
philanthropic
interest
absorb
more
of
his
time
he
say
ellison
will
never
understand
just
how
much
pleasure
and
sense
of
worth
they
can
give
him
job
say
something
similar
albeit
from
the
perspective
of
a
young
man
he
say
my
sense
of
it
be
that
he
s
not
quite
ready
for
the
next
stage
of
his
life
i
don
t
think
oracle
allows
him
enough
time
for
much
of
anything
but
his
family
and
a
little
bit
for
himself
this
be
a
hobby
now
but
it
s
not
yet
a
passion
however
i
think
it
will
become
a
passion
in
come
year
that
will
be
both
fun
and
tremendously
fulfil
for
him

besides
biotech
and
find
interest
way
to
apply
his
wealth
for
the
public
good
ellison
be
dabble
with
the
idea
of
go
into
politics
at
a
time
when
high
profile
ceo
be
not
exactly
top
the
who
do
you
most
admire
poll
and
when
the
memory
of
oracle
s
wound
spat
with
the
state
of
california
be
only
just
begin
to
fade
it
seem
like
a
pretty
crazy
notion
and
with
the
possible
exception
of
michael
bloomberg
in
new
york
though
the
jury
be
still
out
on
him
successful
businessmen
rarely
make
good
politician
they
tend
to
share
an
autocratic
style
a
dislike
of
compromise
and
a
desire
to
quantify
and
analyze
problem
and
set
goal
that
they
expect
to
be
met
most
ceo
be
also
pretty
useless
when
it
come
to
the
art
of
schmooze
and
small
talk
that
lubricate
political
wheel
and
flatter
voter
give
that
most
of
the
above
applies
to
ellison
in
spade
and
be
compound
by
his
hatred
of
pompous
authority
and
determination
never
to
do
anything
he
doesn
t
want
to
one
might
ask
if
he
s
take
leave
of
his
sens
it
s
partly
ellison
s
curiosity
and
constant
challenge
seek
partly
vanity
he
have
to
believe
that
he
would
do
a
well
job
than
some
of
the
office
cling
nonentity
with
whom
he
be
force
to
do

and
partly
idealism
he
be
genuinely
passionate
about
improve
the
low
standard
in
america
s
public
school
and
apply
information
technology
to
solve
some
of
their
problem
oracle
have
give
away
thousand
of
network
computer
and
ellison
be
think
of
use
his
own
money
to
put
expensive
textbook
online
his
close
friend
tom
lantos
the
human
right
campaign
california
congressman
have
urge
him
to
make
a
run
for
the
senate
but
ellison
admits
i
think
i
d
be
a
terrible
freshman
senator
i
m
too
impatient
and
uncompromising
what
do
appeal
to
him
be
take
a
pop
at
become
governor
of
california
since
his
bruising
encounter
with
governor
gray
davis
the
master
of
expediency
over
the
allege
misselling
of
database
license
see
chapter
the
idea
of
run
in
as
an
independent
have
become
even
more
interest
one
thing
that
ellison
would
not
have
to
worry
about
be
money
to
fight
an
effective
campaign
and
it
s
probably
as
much
the
idea
of
the
campaign
that
attracts
him
as
the
possibility
of
win
as
joshua
lederberg
say
to
him
so
you
win
it
s
the
day
after
that
your
problem
begin
so
what
exactly
be
ellison
s
politics
he
say
that
politics
be
always
talk
about
at
home
his
adopt
father
lou
once
ran
unsuccessfully
for
the
state
legislature
ellison
think
but
doesn
t
seem
totally
sure
while
his
brother
in
law
david
linn
be
politically
active
and
serve
on
the
illinois
constitutional
convention
ellison
say
in
my
family
you
be
either
a
liberal
democrat
or
a
very
liberal
democrat
those
be
the
only
two
political
ideology
represent
around
our
dinner
table
in
what
he
describes
as
the
jewish
ghetto
in
chicago
where
he
be
raise
the
politics
of
the
ellison
and
linns
be
fairly
typical
the
big
issue
during
ellison
s
teen
year
be
civil
right
which
naturally
enough
everyone
he
knew
be
passionate
about
perhaps
as
a
result
ellison
s
first
foray
into
political
activism
be
work
for
robert
kennedy
s
presidential
campaign
ellison
s
political
hero
be
all
of
the
man
of
destiny
type
winston
churchill
napoleon
douglas
macarthur
and
like
them
kennedy
be
a
contradictory
character
tough
but
complex
ellison
say
of
churchill
and
macarthur
they
have
great
intellectual
and
moral
integrity
they
have
the
courage
to
do
what
they
believe
to
be
right
rather
than
what
be
popular
or
politically
expedient
at
the
time
i
admire
people
with
the
strength
to
take
a
stand
against
the
majority
when
they
believe
the
majority
be
wrong
churchill
take
a
strong
stand
against
hitler
in
the
mid
s
and
he
be
ridicule
and
ostracize
from
his
own
party
for
do
so
but
he
do
it
anyway
that
s
courage
that
s
integrity
i
admire
risk
taker
i
like
leader
people
who
do
thing
before
they
become
fashionable
or
popular
i
find
that
kind
of
integrity
be
inspirational
after
robert
kennedy
s
assassination
in
june
ellison
s
interest
in
politics
wan
i
kind
of
give
up
after
they
shot
bobby
i
just
didn
t
care
anymore
there
be
nobody
left
that
i
like
it
be
ellison
s
grow
business
success
in
the
late
s
that
help
to
reengage
him
as
a
wealthy
individual
who
be
make
his
money
in
the
glamorous
world
of
high
tech
ellison
be
a
perfect
target
for
fund
raiser
however
few
of
the
politician
who
approach
him
for
money
make
any
impact
on
him
al
gore
with
his
carefully
cultivate
contact
in
the
tech
business
and
high
profile
support
for
the
internet
might
have
seem
a
natural
home
for
some
of
ellison
s
money
but
ellison
despise
gore
after
buying
the
parallel
processing
computer
firm
ncube
ellison
go
to
see
then
senator
gore
to
complain
about
the
preferential
treatment
that
a
rival
think
machine
seem
to
be
get
not
only
be
think
machine
win
government
contract
at
ncube
s
expense
but
it
be
also
be
directly
support
with
tax
dollar
that
gore
have
be
instrumental
in
steer
its
way
ellison
say
that
when
he
complain
to
gore
about
this
double
whammy
the
future
vice
president
smile
and
say
to
him
what
you
ve
get
to
understand
larry
be
that
think
machine
have
be
very
good
to
me
ellison
explode
what
do
you
mean
they
ve
be
good
to
you
just
how
good
have
they
be
senator
what
unit
of
goodness
be
we
talk
about
here
ellison
say
simply
i
guess
he
just
want
me
to
offer
him
a
campaign
contribution
similar
to
the
one
he
be
get
from
think
machine
but
back
then
i
didn
t
know
how
the
game
be
played
so
i
just
kind
of
lose
it
ellison
met
plenty
of
other
pol
but
say
i
be
profoundly
unimpressed
by
nearly
all
of
them
until
bill
clinton
i
met
him
when
he
be
governor
of
arkansas
we
spent
a
few
hour
together
discuss
a
variety
of
issue
he
s
incredibly
smart
and
just
plain
interest
i
end
up
be
the
second
large
contributor
to
his
first
presidential
campaign
in
i
give
him
about
half
a
million
dollar
that
be
before
he
picked
gore
as
his
vice
president
after
that
i
didn
t
contribute
a
dime
it
s
curious
that
he
be
so
drawn
to
someone
whom
many
people
would
consider
the
very
antithesis
of
ellison
s
hero
an
infinitely
flexible
political
pragmatist
rather
than
a
man
of
unbend
principle
and
conviction
nor
do
clinton
when
in
office
pursue
the
kind
of
agenda
that
ellison
particularly
support
his
halfhearted
use
of
american
military
power
his
tedious
political
correctness
on
issue
such
as
recruiting
homosexual
to
the
military
his
be
in
thrall
to
his
ideological
wife
over
her
disastrous
attempt
to
reform
health
care
and
his
lack
of
conviction
on
the
subject
closest
to
ellison
s
heart
the
appal
state
of
the
nation
s
secondary
school
because
of
his
timidity
in
the
face
of
the
teacher
union
the
most
probable
explanation
be
that
ellison
like
many
other
people
be
bowl
over
by
clinton
s
extraordinary
charisma
and
his
intellectual
quickness
ellison
doesn
t
demur
i
just
like
the
guy
he
be
so
interest
brilliant
complex
ambitious
troubled
talented
i
ve
never
met
anyone
quite
like
him
nobody
love
be
alive
more
than
bill
clinton
and
you
can
t
help
feel
the
same
passion
for
life
when
you
re
with
him
melanie
and
i
have
an
unforgettable
time
jazz
club
with
him
in
new
orleans
the
man
heightens
your
sens
and
teach
you
what
it
mean
to
be
alive
roughly
the
same
age
both
illegitimate
both
extremely
successful
both
risk
taker
in
their
professional
and
personal
life
and
both
a
little
bit
in
love
with
their
own
wit
and
intelligence
it
s
not
surprising
that
the
two
men
hit
it
off
and
have
remain
good
friend
nonetheless
clinton
in
office
be
a
disappointment
to
ellison
ellison
s
anger
about
the
quality
of
secondary
education
may
have
be
influence
by
his
own
experience
at
school
as
an
employer
of
some
forty
thousand
people
a
good
many
of
them
not
only
superbright
but
also
the
product
of
the
education
system
of
much
poorer
country
ellison
know
something
about
american
secondary
education
as
he
put
it
whatever
the
failing
of
america
s
health
care
system
mainly
that
it
cost
a
lot
and
be
socially
divisive
people
still
get
on
plane
to
come
and
get
treat
in
america
but
it
s
a
long
time
since
he
s
heard
of
anybody
come
because
of
the
excellence
of
america
s
publicly
fund
high
school
he
s
most
incense
by
the
nexus
between
the
teach
union
and
the
democratic
party
the
teacher
union
be
one
of
the
anchor
tenant
of
the
party
he
grumble
and
the
obstacle
that
place
in
the
path
of
worthwhile
reform
he
s
particularly
fond
of
the
idea
of
education
voucher
to
give
some
economic
clout
to
poor
family
he
say
the
california
public
school
be
a
disgrace
too
many
poor
minority
child
be
condemn
to
go
to
school
that
fail
to
teach
african
american
and
hispanic
child
should
have
a
choice
of
school
any
mechanism
that
give
them
that
choice
magnet
school
open
enrollment
voucher
i
m
for
i
m
prochoice
on
school
if
he
ran
for
the
governorship
he
would
concentrate
on
introduce
voucher
improve
health
care
and
keep
the
light
on
he
say
california
be
a
huge
economy
and
there
s
plenty
of
money
available
to
solve
our
educational
and
health
care
problem
if
we
can
get
rid
of
some
of
the
unconscionable
waste
apart
from
that
i
d
concentrate
on
not
do
anything
monumentally
stupid
like
lose
billion
speculate
in
the
energy
market
i
m
a
pretty
good
problem
solver
so
i
might
be
a
good
governor
another
thing
he
point
out
as
be
in
his
favor
be
that
no
special
interest
group
could
buy
him
how
serious
be
he
he
s
definitely
drawn
to
the
idea
of
run
and
the
opportunity
it
would
give
him
to
put
issue
that
he
care
about
on
the
agenda
and
compare
with
the
well
name
gray
davis
or
his
equally
drab
republican
rival
in
bill
simon
ellison
would
have
presence
and
charisma
to
burn
but
ellison
s
flamboyance
may
also
have
make
him
too
many
enemy
in
business
to
survive
a
tough
campaign
against
embattle
party
machine
and
there
s
no
escape
the
fact
that
he
have
enough
personal
history
to
give
a
prurient
press
a
field
day
be
that
what
he
really
need
ellison
say
that
it
all
depends
on
how
fed
up
people
be
with
the
traditional
politician
by
the
time
he
s
ready
to
run
fed
up
with
their
incompetence
their
pander
to
special
interest
group
their
news
speak
and
their
dreary
political
correctness
if
jesse
ventura
can
make
it
he
say
why
not
larry
ellison
but
ventura
could
more
easily
present
himself
as
be
on
the
side
of
the
little
guy
than
california
s
wealthy
citizen
can
the
only
thing
that
can
be
say
with
certainty
be
that
if
ellison
do
decide
to
run
it
won
t
be
dull

what
s
also
certain
be
that
ellison
want
to
stay
busy
one
thing
that
he
be
acutely
conscious
of
despite
rumor
to
the
contrary
be
his
own
mortality
life
be
the
only
miracle
he
often
say
with
sixty
fast
approach
he
think
increasingly
about
how
to
extract
the
most
from
what
be
left
to
him
i
don
t
waste
a
lot
of
time
i
work
intensely
on
thing
i
care
about
and
i
spend
my
time
with
people
that
i
care
about
i
do
what
i
want
to
with
my
time
because
i
know
there
s
not
much
of
it
left
some
of
this
urgency
may
be
the
consequence
of
ellison
s
lack
of
any
religious
belief
although
he
be
brought
up
in
reform
judaism
his
family
be
not
particularly
religious
and
the
teaching
at
hebrew
school
never
stuck
the
closest
that
ellison
be
prepared
to
get
to
god
or
anything
that
might
be
term
spiritual
be
nature
a
sunrise
in
yosemite
valley
or
the
cherry
blossom
blowing
in
the
wind
at
sunset
in
kyoto
that
be
where
i
find
god
he
say
in
this
glorious
accident
of
be
alive
what
may
also
have
concentrate
ellison
s
mind
on
the
fragile
glory
of
life
be
his
still
recent
brush
with
death
although
he
have
never
have
any
serious
illness
he
nearly
kill
himself
twice
in
when
he
broke
his
neck
while
bodysurfing
in
hawaii
and
soon
after
smash
himself
up
in
a
serious
bicycle
accident
career
down
a
mountain
in
napa
he
manage
to
stick
the
front
wheel
of
his
bike
into
a
section
of
disused
railroad
track
the
impact
as
he
hit
the
ground
be
traumatic
smash
his
arm
in
twenty
eight
place
and
blowing
the
bone
through
the
skin
it
take
four
operation
to
rebuild
the
arm
use
bone
from
ellison
s
hip
and
more
than
two
year
of
rehab
in
the
gym
where
he
train
with
joe
montana
before
he
regain
his
strength
typically
ellison
boast
that
at
the
end
of
this
period
he
manage
to
beat
a
champion
triathlete
at
dip
although
he
do
admit
that
the
lighter
triathlete
be
handicapped
by
wear
a
thirty
five
pound
weight
vest
if
the
feeling
of
power
and
well
be
that
come
from
physical
fitness
be
a
critical
part
of
the
glory
of
be
alive
for
ellison
so
too
be
constant
mental
stimulation
he
say
as
long
as
you
re
learn
as
long
as
you
re
solve
problem
as
long
as
you
be
work
with
your
mind
then
you
re
alive
problem
intrigue
excite
and
energize
me
although
ellison
joke
about
his
dislike
of
drinking
alcohol
say
that
it
make
him
even
more
unbearably
over
the
top
than
he
already
be
the
real
reason
be
that
he
have
what
amount
almost
to
a
terror
of
anything
that
might
interfere
with
the
work
of
his
brain
he
say
i
can
t
stand
anything
that
cloud
my
mind
i
couldn
t
take
the
painkiller
they
prescribed
for
me
when
i
be
in
the
hospital
with
my
arm
broken
in
twenty
eight
place
i
take
tylenol
instead
i
d
rather
deal
with
the
pain
than
lose
my
mind
to
the
medication
i
have
no
problem
with
people
drinking
i
have
no
problem
with
other
people
smoking
dope
if
that
s
what
they
want
to
do
god
bless
them
that
s
their
business
but
i
can
t
do
those
thing
ellison
i
think
will
find
cop
with
the
debility
of
old
age
even
more
difficult
than
most
of
us
will
what
would
he
prefer
i
wonder
a
relatively
shorter
life
and
go
out
with
a
bang
or
deal
with
the
feebleness
of
advanced
age
would
i
rather
die
at
eighty
or
be
feeble
between
eighty
and
ninety
i
ll
take
feeble
if
that
s
okay
with
you
i
d
never
accept
be
feeble
though
i
d
work
out
by
compete
in
walker
race
against
the
seventy
year
old
he
admit
that
much
of
what
the
medical
foundation
be
work
on
be
way
to
help
people
live
the
last
year
of
their
life
in
a
healthy
and
robust
fashion
in
the
absence
of
any
near
term
breakthrough
from
the
emf
i
couldn
t
help
ask
ellison
whether
he
be
take
anything
to
help
him
stay
youthful
the
answer
be
disappointingly
prosaic
just
a
few
over
the
counter
dietary
supplement
available
for
a
few
dollar
such
as
dhea
a
steroidal
precursor
that
encourages
the
production
of
testosterone
in
old
men
and
melatonin
a
natural
sleep
enhancer
that
compensates
for
the
decline
efficiency
of
the
pituitary
gland
so
no
fountain
of
youth
and
hand
on
heart
no
cosmetic
surgery
since
his
broken
nose
be
fix
nearly
thirty
year
ago
if
ellison
be
so
certain
that
there
be
no
life
after
death
be
he
like
many
rich
men
try
to
secure
a
kind
of
immortality
with
his
money
well
he
say
i
hope
my
child
will
be
proud
of
me
after
i
ve
go
but
i
think
it
s
a
big
mistake
for
people
to
die
very
wealthy
and
leave
it
to
their
spouse
or
their
child
to
give
their
money
away
why
should
they
have
all
the
fun
i
want
to
give
it
away
myself
and
see
some
of
the
result
before
i
die
surprisingly
perhaps
steve
job
believe
that
for
all
his
emotional
difficulty
in
deal
with
the
death
of
others
ellison
have
succeed
in
come
to
term
with
his
own
mortality
job
say
what
make
some
people
very
effective
in
the
way
they
use
the
time
left
to
them
be
that
they
frequently
remember
that
they
re
go
to
die
soon
a
lot
of
people
get
to
the
end
of
their
life
and
only
then
realize
that
they
re
go
to
die
and
that
they
should
have
make
a
lot
of
decision
differently
larry
think
about
death
often
and
i
think
a
person
like
that
have
a
much
well
chance
of
grow
old
gracefully
i
think
that
one
day
ellison
will
be
able
to
disengage
from
oracle
but
as
long
as
he
think
oracle
need
him
it
will
continue
to
have
a
prior
claim
over
anything
else
however
assume
he
do
create
a
few
degree
of
separation
between
himself
and
oracle
he
will
plunge
more
deeply
into
those
other
area
of
interest
he
probably
won
t
find
the
cure
for
cancer
as
josh
lederberg
say
that
s
go
to
be
a
long
haul
but
through
his
medical
foundation
quark
and
his
propose
rockefeller
west
research
university
he
have
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
have
fun
and
do
a
lot
of
good
at
the
same
time
but
he
should
forget
about
the
politics
even
in
win
he
would
be
bound
to
fail
if
you
re
larry
ellison
why
choose
to
be
unhappy

ellison
say
that
in
new
york
a
similar
effort
be
under
way
include
the
creation
of
an
emergency
office
locator
to
help
identify
the
temporary
office
location
of
thousand
of
displace
worker
as
the
provider
of
the
software
that
power
nearly
all
their
database
ellison
knew
well
than
almost
anyone
that
the
u
s
security
agency
be
technologically
ill
prepared
to
protect
the
united
state
from
far
terrorist
outrage
there
be
two
major
deficiency
the
first
be
the
ease
with
which
potential
terrorist
could
enter
the
united
state
and
disappear
thanks
to
a
combination
of
lax
rule
for
the
issue
of
visa
and
the
lack
of
a
standardize
id
card
system
most
of
the
hijacker
have
multiple
steal
identity
the
second
be
the
difficulty
of
create
an
effective
and
cross
checkable
watch
list
without
which
monitoring
suspicious
behavior
be
impossible
and
just
as
the
root
cause
of
poor
information
management
in
the
private
sector
almost
always
turn
out
to
be
fragment
data
cause
by
information
be
dumped
into
too
many
small
database
that
couldn
t
easily
communicate
with
one
another
the
same
be
true
in
spade
of
government
in
general
and
the
security
service
in
particular
make
the
problem
even
bad
be
long
stand
inter
agency
rivalry
especially
between
the
fbi
and
the
cia
which
reinforce
the
chronic
data
fragmentation
with
a
cultural
bias
against
share
intelligence
ellison
s
remedy
be
the
introduction
of
a
national
standard
for
government
id
card
use
biometric
authorization
technology
link
to
a
single
consolidated
national
security
database
he
knew
that
while
what
he
be
propose
be
technically
not
difficult
for
oracle
to
do
both
idea
would
be
deeply
controversial
on
both
civil
libertarian
and
political
ground
but
he
have
be
impressed
when
the
secretary
of
defense
donald
rumsfeld
have
remark
that
the
difference
between
the
war
against
terrorism
and
more
conventional
conflict
be
that
this
be
a
war
that
would
be
won
not
by
cruise
missile
or
bomber
but
by
some
scrap
of
vital
information
within
a
few
day
of
the
terror
attack
ellison
have
decide
that
it
be
his
public
duty
to
campaign
for
both
national
standard
for
government
id
card
and
a
national
security
database
and
that
oracle
would
donate
the
software
to
make
it
possible
the
first
stage
of
the
campaign
be
to
start
talk
and
write
about
it
ellison
spent
several
day
sweat
over
an
op
ed
piece
that
he
hop
to
place
in
the
new
york
time
the
time
decline
to
take
the
article
but
the
wall
street
journal
offer
it
a
home
albeit
in
greatly
shorten
form
this
be
what
ellison
write
digital
id
can
help
prevent
terrorism
by
larry
ellison

since
the
september
attack
our
country
have
be
thrust
into
a
debate
over
how
to
root
out
terrorist
while
also
maintain
our
civil
liberty
one
of
the
suggestion
propose
though
not
yet
fully
debate
be
that
of
national
identification
card
many
american
instinctively
fear
that
a
national
id
card
would
sacrifice
basic
freedom
and
compromise
personal
privacy
they
suspect
our
government
would
build
big
brother
database
that
would
be
well
at
snoop
on
law
abide
citizen
than
catch
terrorist
they
rightly
agree
that
if
we
lose
our
liberty
the
terrorist
will
have
won
on
the
face
of
it
issue
id
card
do
seem
a
significant
step
trust
government
to
maintain
a
database
with
our
name
address
place
of
work
amount
and
source
of
income
asset
purchase
travel
destination
and
more
seem
a
huge
leap
of
faith
but
we
should
remember
that
these
database
already
exist
and
that
we
willingly
help
in
their
creation
for
year
company
like
american
express
and
visa
have
be
issue
card
and
building
up
information
on
million
of
american
the
database
they
maintain
be
search
and
sell
on
a
daily
basis
we
should
remember
too
that
the
government
already
track
thing
lot
of
thing
federal
state
and
local
agency
issue
social
security
card
driver
s
license
pilot
s
license
passport
and
visa
they
maintain
thousand
of
database
to
keep
track
of
everyone
from
taxpayer
and
voter
to
suspect
terrorist
and
so
the
question
be
not
whether
the
government
should
issue
id
card
and
maintain
database
they
already
do
the
question
be
whether
the
one
we
have
can
be
make
more
effective
especially
when
it
come
to
find
criminal
do
we
need
one
national
id
card
no
but
the
id
that
the
government
issue
such
as
social
security
card
should
use
modern
credit
card
technology
do
we
need
more
database
no
just
the
opposite
the
big
problem
today
be
that
we
have
too
many
the
single
thing
we
could
do
to
make
life
tougher
for
terrorist
would
be
to
ensure
that
all
the
information
in
myriad
government
database
be
integrate
into
a
single
comprehensive
national
security
file
today
every
federal
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
agency
the
central
intelligence
agency
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
the
national
security
agency
and
all
manner
of
state
and
local
body
maintain
their
own
separate
database
on
suspect
criminal
all
these
separate
database
make
it
difficult
for
one
agency
to
know
about
and
apprehend
someone
want
by
another
agency
that
s
why
one
of
the
september
hijacker
make
it
through
u
s
passport
control
even
though
he
have
an
outstanding
arrest
warrant
in
broward
county
florida
the
fbi
be
search
for
several
other
of
the
terrorist
because
cia
intelligence
reveal
they
have
tie
to
osama
bin
laden
four
more
be
sought
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
because
they
be
in
the
country
illegally
such
a
national
database
though
a
large
undertaking
be
possible
my
company
for
example
have
already
offer
to
provide
the
necessary
software
for
free
and
i
m
sure
other
company
would
pitch
in
with
hardware
and
support
it
s
important
these
donation
be
make
with
no
string
attach
the
database
would
be
maintain
and
run
by
the
government
alone
with
no
question
of
corporation
benefiting
the
us
of
such
a
database
would
be
significant
airline
for
example
could
cross
check
the
name
of
passenger
with
name
on
a
watch
list
if
this
have
be
do
many
of
the
september
terrorist
would
have
be
caught
before
they
board
their
flight
mandatory
check
could
be
supplement
with
voluntary
check
company
for
example
might
elect
to
submit
the
name
of
job
applicant
as
a
part
of
their
reference
check
process
if
the
submit
name
be
on
the
watch
list
the
fbi
not
the
company
would
be
notify
another
challenge
be
track
people
with
multiple
or
steal
identity
the
good
news
be
that
a
national
database
combine
with
biometrics
thumb
print
hand
print
iris
scan
or
other
new
technology
could
detect
false
identity
gain
entry
to
an
airport
or
other
secure
location
would
require
people
to
present
a
photo
id
put
their
thumb
on
a
fingerprint
scanner
and
tell
the
guard
their
social
security
number
this
information
would
be
cross
checked
with
the
database
the
government
could
phase
in
digital
id
card
to
replace
exist
social
security
card
and
driver
s
license
these
new
id
should
be
base
on
a
uniform
standard
such
as
credit
card
technology
which
be
harder
to
counterfeit
than
exist
government
id
or
on
smart
card
technology
which
be
well
but
more
expensive
there
be
no
need
to
compel
any
american
to
have
a
digital
id
some
american
may
choose
to
apply
for
a
digital
id
card
to
speed
the
airport
security
check
in
process
some
state
might
use
digital
id
for
their
next
generation
of
driver
s
license
company
might
want
to
replace
their
current
hodgepodge
of
id
with
the
new
system
in
fact
a
voluntary
system
of
standardize
id
issue
by
government
agency
and
private
company
could
prove
more
effective
than
a
mandatory
system
we
don
t
need

our
liberty
for
our
life

fourth
amendment
protection

with
the
head
of

analyze
the
huge
quantity
of
information
they
be
now
feverishly
gathering
on
the
bin
laden
global
terrorist
network
it
would
be
an
opportunity
to
evangelize
the
proposal
in
his
article
to
the
people
who
could
actually
make
it
happen
afterward
he
would
fly
to
new
york
for
tv
interview
to
publicize
his
idea
and
more
prosaically
a
ceo
roundtable
to
sell

arrive
late
in
the
even
of
october
at

in

an
unattractive
hotel
catering
for
conference
some
twelve
mile
from
washington
supposedly
chosen
by
jay
nussbaum
because
of
its
closeness
to
the
cia
ellison
s
first
meeting
the
follow
day
be
one
that
he
would
rather
not
have
be
have
at
such
a
time
the
digital
hospital
project
that
have
be
launch
with
such
fanfare
at
healthsouth
s
birmingham
campus
some
six
month
earlier
be
in
trouble
and
healthsouth
s
ceo
richard
scrushy
be
determine
to
grab
ellison
while
he
s
relatively
nearby
healthsouth
personnel
have
turn
up
in
force
but
so
have
oracle
s
with
key
member
from
nussbaum
s
team
know
within
oracle
as
jay
inc
and
john
wookey
a
high
rank
developer
who
built
large
part
of
the
service
version
of
oracle
s
erp
suite
although
ellison
be
more
than
half
an
hour
late
he
and
scrushy
seem
quite
happy
to
waste
the
first
five
minute
chat
about
airplane
but
when
scrushy
get
go
it
s
clear
he
s
livid
accuse
oracle
of
fall
down
on
the
undertaking
it
make
when
the
project
be
announce
ellison
start
off
by
recap
what
his
understand
of
oracle
s
commitment
be
oracle
he
say
be
responsible
for
create
an
architecture
an
information
heart
for
the
hospital
s
clinical
and
administrative
system
a
central
repository
for
application
to
place
and
retrieve
information
the
idea
be
for
oracle
to
establish
a
common
data
model
that
all
the
other
vendor
involve
in
the
project
can
easily
write
to
we
want
to
make
the
integration
trivial
say
ellison
have
anything
change
he
implies
that
if
there
be
a
problem
it
must
be
because
other
vendor
be
not
cooperate
after
protract
attempt
at
negotiate
the
healthsouth
contract
ellison
decides
he
s
have
enough
of
the
whole
sorry
mess
the
health
care
initiative
that
mean
so
much
to
oracle
now
have
its
own
momentum
thanks
to
the
relationship
that
john
wookey
have
built
with
other
partner
and
ellison
will
be
very
happy
not
to
spend
any
more
time
with
his
fellow
fly
enthusiast
richard
scrushy
even
when
the
digital
hospital
project
be
in
its
promising
infancy
there
be
something
about
scrushy
that
troubled
him
but
now
he
can
t
stand
the
sight
of
the
man

the
postmaster
general
s
large
office
face
south
with
view
across
the
potomac
and
to
the
pentagon
beyond
from
where
we
re
sit
it
s
not
difficult
to
see
where
the
american
airline
boeing
plow
into
washington
s
most
formidable
building
although
ellison
jay
nussbaum
and
kevin
fitzgerald
the
sale
executive
oracle
recently
poach
from
archrival
siebel
have
come
to
sell

everyone
seem
uncomfortable
about
raise
the

ellison
asks
jack

a
large
rather
shamble
veteran
of

potter

ups
say
ellison
have
achieve
huge
cost
saving
with
more
than

to
manage
and

make
the

the
big
logistics
business
in
the

the
potential
for
efficiency
be
stagger
but
only
as
long
as
there
be
enough
flexibility
within
the

to
allow

although
the
issue
face
potter
be
very
different
from

potter
say
that
because
of
the

the

for

something
ambitious
be
right
it
s
not
the
only
time
we
ll
hear
that
sentiment
while
we

in
washington
in
a
recent
interview
in
catalyst

secretary
tommy
thompson
paint
a
picture
of
it
chaos
within
the
department
with
the
big
budget
billion
in
the
federal
government
we
have
over
different
server
and
it
staff
we
have
different
computer
system
with
different
e
mail
capability
some
of
which
do
not
communicate
with
each
other
we
have

we
have

their

their

they

now
how
do
you
run
a
department
like
that
it
will
be
interest
to
see
whether
thompson
s
appetite
for
radical
reform
have
survive
the
journey
from
the
governor
s
mansion
in
madison
wisconsin
to
hhs
s
vast
neo
stalinist
fortress
at
independence
avenue
it
s
also
ellison
s
chance
to
float
his
other
big
idea
the
one
about
a
single
national
medical
record
database
jack
kemp
onetime
republican
vice
presidential
candidate
and
an
oracle
board
member
have
help
to
fix
the
meeting
with
thompson
and
be
there
to
meet
us
under
a
bust
of
hubert
humphrey
a
politician
of
a
very
different
stripe
kemp
be
an
affable
man
with
a
disconcertingly
loud
voice
and
a
mop
of
carefully
sculpt
white
hair
when
we
arrive
in
thompson
s
office
he
seem
genuinely
thrill
to
meet
ellison
and
insists
on
go
through
a
rather
ridiculous
performance
seat
a
slightly
embarrass
ellison
at
his
desk
and
have
him
pose
for
a
photographer
as
act
secretary
with
these
jollity
out
of
the
way
thompson
a
small
man
with
rather
florid
feature
open
the
conversation
with
a
statistic
that
could
have
come
straight
from
ellison
s
own
mouth
as
many
as
ninety
eight
thousand
individual
allegedly
die
last
year
from
medical
mistake
most
of
those
death
be
cause
by
the
administration
of
drug
and
drug
interaction
the
cause
say
thompson
be
the
antiquate
way
in
which
prescription
be
make
out
and
drug
distribute
the
lack
of
technology
in
our
hospital
he
say
be
an
absolute
disgrace
ellison
can
hardly
contain
himself
with
an
almost
beatific
smile
he
embarks
on
a
well
practice
riff
a
single
national
medical
record
database
would
save
thousand
of
life
every
year
by
prevent
dangerous
combination
of
drug
from
be
prescribed
and
a
national
health
record
database
would
save
billion
of
dollar
because
it
be
so
much
cheaper
to
run
than
all
those
separate
medical
record
system
we
currently
use
you
have
to
be
willing
to
save
money
if
you
want
to
save
life
for
example
walgreen
and
rite
aid
two
of
the
big
pharmacy
chain
have
built
database
system
to
record
patient
prescription
and
to
issue
alert
about
possibly
dangerous
drug
interaction
but
they
re
entirely
separate
system
that
can
t
communicate
with
each
other
so
if
you
don
t
always
buy
your
medicine
from
the
same
chain
they
won
t
be
able
to
help
you
ellison
asks
how
much
be
we
spending
on
medical
record
keep
out
of
the
trillion
we
spend
on
health
care
each
year
i
ve
heard
estimate
as
high
as
thirty
cent
on
the
dollar
or
nearly
billion
we
d
save
half
of
that
billion
if
we
have
a
national
medical
record
database
and
with
one
medical
record
database
we
d
get
well
privacy
and
well
accuracy
but
most
important
we
d
save
life
the
opportunity
be
extraordinary
thompson
think
that
record
keep
may
be
cost
only
eighteen
cent
on
the
dollar
but
he
get
the
point
it
s
so
shameful
he
say
but
how
do
we
do
it
as
ellison
expands
his
thought
explain
how
it
would
be
possible
for
all
party
to
keep
their
exist
database
if
they
want
to
as
long
as
they
agree
to
copy
everything
that
go
into
them
into
one
central
database
thompson
again
asks
how
do
i
accomplish
this
thompson
s
problem
be
that
understandably
he
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
scale
of
the
task
before
him
he
s
already
encounter
bureaucratic
inertia
and
special
interest
group
pushback
of
a
kind
that
fourteen
year
as
governor
of
wisconsin
haven
t
prepared
him
for
it
s
even
possible
that
he
s
begin
to
fear
that
in
the
three
and
a
half
year
left
to
him
in
the
job
he
may
end
up
achieve
little
of
what
he
want
to
do
and
here
come
ellison
not
just
sing
from
the
same
hymn
sheet
not
just
tell
him
what
the
problem
be
but
offering
solution
ellison
have
two
suggestion
the
first
be
that
thompson
who
say
he
want
to
introduce
paperless
hospital
and
self
service
check
in
for
patient
should
meet
with
the
oracle
healthsouth
team
the
second
be
that
thompson
should
follow
the
same
path
as
ellison
when
he
start
turn
oracle
into
an
e
business
start
with
some
cheap
thrill
that
will
demonstrate
to
skeptic
what
s
possible
and
use
the
cost
saving
they
generate
to
fund
more
ambitious
project
start
with
e
mail
say
ellison
we
could
replace
all
your
e
mail
system
with
just
one
unified
system
in
ninety
day
if
we
don
t
eliminate
seventy
five
percent
of
your
e
mail
cost
i
ll
personally
pay
for
it
thompson
be
so
impressed
that
he
want
to
know
from
his
adviser
whether
he
can
start
on
it
right
away
without
put
out
a
request
for
proposal
rfp
to
allow
other
vendor
to
bid
ellison
s
story
about
how
oracle
succeed
in
halve
its
it
budget
and
get
dramatically
well
information
in
the
process
have
gotten
him
hooked
on
the
way
out
ellison
asks
me
could
we
have
have
a
meeting
like
that
before

any
of
these

but
ellison
have
promise
to
tell
me
as
much
as
he
prudently
can
when
we
fly
to

on

even
late
on
wednesday
when

that

that
the
bad

be
very
bad
pure
evil
there
be
no
limit
on
what
they
re
willing
to
do
to
harm
us
if
they
could
kill
us
all
they
would
the
next
day
i
meet
ellison
outside
the
department
of
justice
on
pennsylvania
avenue
after
his
lunch
with
attorney
general
ashcroft
our
next
appointment
be
at
the
pentagon
with
the
comptroller
at
the
defense
department
and
after
that
we
re
go
to
the
hill
to
see
an
old
friend
of
ellison
the
former
mayor
of
san
francisco
and
now
the
senior
california
senator
dianne
feinstein
senator
feinstein
have
ask
to
see
ellison
after
reading
his
article
in
the
wall
street
journal
as
she
will
be
chair
a
hearing
of
the
terrorism
subcommittee
on
friday
but
i
m
eager
for
news
of
the
morning
the
time
spent
at
langley
be
impressively
productive
but
although
ellison
be
slightly
reluctant
to
admit
it
his
encounter
with
ashcroft
be
something
of
a
disappointment
he
say
that
ashcroft
seem
to
be
rather
remote
and
unwilling
to
talk
about
anything
substantive
his
main
preoccupation
be
privacy
legislation
which
make
the
job
of
law
enforcement
more
difficult
how
can
we
be
expect
to
catch
terrorist
when
the
law
forbids
a
parent
to
have
access
to
her
own
child
s
exam
result
on
the
way
to
the
pentagon
kevin
fitzgerald
explains
that
the
defense
department
have
put
out
an
rfp
for
a
commercial
financial
system
that
would
be
use
servicewide
it
s
likely
to
be
a
bake
off
between
sap
and
oracle
fitzgerald
say
it
could
be
one
of
the
big
financial
application
deal
ever
with
the
opportunity
to
sell
other
e
business
suite
application
that
need
to
be
integrate
into
the
financials
package
although
oracle
be
not
heavy
handedly
make
the
point
that
it
would
be
odd
for
the
pentagon
to
buy
german
fitzgerald
want
to
hire
the
lobbying
company
of
the
previous
defense
secretary
william

we
then
head
back
across

to
the
hart
senate
office
building
for
a
meeting
with
senator
feinstein
when
feinstein
join
us
in
her
conference
room
she
embrace
ellison
tenderly
and
start
pump
him
for
view
and
information
she
can
use
at
the
next
day
s
hearing
she
s
particularly
exercise
about
the
lax
oversight
of
the
million
or
so
temporary
visitor
to
the
united
state
each
year
without
an
adequate
track
system
she
say
our
country
have
become
a
sieve
create
ample
opportunity
for
terrorist
to
enter
and
establish
their
operation
without
detection
ellison
talk
about
his
national
id
plan
and
how
he
would
make
it
mandatory
for
anyone
enter
the
country
to
have
a
visa
and
a
card
with
biometric
information
on
it
whip
out
his
wallet
he
asks
her
to
compare
the
sophistication
of
his
credit
card
a
black
centurion
american
express
card
with
the
shoddy
and
easily
forgeable
little
piece
of
cardboard
that

his
commercial
pilot
s
license
feinstein
be
so
appalled
that
she
immediately
get
an
aide
to
fire
off
a
letter
to
the
secretary
of
transportation
for
much
of
her
legislative
career
feinstein
have
be
promote
precisely
the
kind
of
privacy
measure
that
be
now
make
the
job
of
the
security
agency
so
difficult
she
rather
limply
suggests
that
ellison
s
plan
would
provoke
a
huge
uproar
but
she
doesn
t
protest
much
when
ellison
point
out
that
we
ve
already
lose
our
privacy
thanks
to
the
easily
available
information
on
nearly
all
of
us
that
the

to
have
multiple
steal
identity
feinstein
be
even
prepared
to
admit
that
the
exist
privacy
law
have
go
too
far
we
ll
pay
the
piper
for
it
she
say
feinstein
also
want
to
hear
more
about
ellison
s
offer
to
donate
the
software
for
the
national
security
database
ellison
confirms
it
while
explain
that
he
s
talk
about
just
the
software
not
the
labor
or
network
or
hardware
whether
feinstein
understands
exactly
what
he
be
propose
be
uncertain
but
she
call
it
the
best
offer
we
ve
have
all
day
and
asks
ellison
if
he
ll
put
his
offer
in
a
letter
that
she
can
brandish
at
her
committee
s
hearing
next
day
descend
the
step
of
congress
into
the
warm
autumn
sunshine
ellison
seem
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
emotion
i
can
t
help
think
about
how
close
we
come
to
lose
this
building
how
the
capitol
dome
could
have
come
crash
down
on
top
of
all
those
people
we
picked
to
represent
us
i
look
at
that
dome
now
and
i
see
something
quite
fragile
something
that
need
to
be
protect
jay
nussbaum
be
there
to
meet
us
at
the
dulles
jet
center
where
the
g
be
wait
to
take
us
up
to
new
york
bustling
toward
us
he
can
t
wait
to
tell
ellison
that
not
only
have
tommy
thompson
s
office
be
in
touch
to
get
thing
move
on
ellison
s
e
mail
offer
though
there
s
some
nervousness
about
their
bos
s
determination
to
cut
through
red
tape
and
give
oracle
sole
vendor
status
without
an
rfp
but
the
fbi
have
be
on
the
phone
seven
time
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
jeez
say
nussbaum
i
ve
never
know
anything
like
it
this
be
something
completely
different
i
m
just
stun

on
the
plane
ellison
and
i
settle
down
to
discus
the
last
forty
eight
hour
and
the
way
that
oracle
be
find
itself
in
the
front
line
of
the
administration
s
war
against
terrorism
ellison
reflect
our
first
customer
be
the
central
intelligence
agency
our
second
customer
be
the
defense
intelligence
agency
and
our
third
customer
be
the
national
security
agency
at
the
very
begin
of
my
career
i
be
building
information
system
for
these
intelligence
agency
and
here
i
be
at
the
end
of
my
career
building
information
system
for
the
same
intelligence
agency
what
s
different
be
their
sense
of
urgency
since
the
attack
of
september
eleventh
this
town
s
be
on
a
war
footing
the
last
time
thing
move
this
fast
be
world
war
ii
since
his
wall
street
journal
article
ellison
have
note
how
ironic
it
be
that
credit
database
for
manage
financial
risk
do
a
much
well
job
of
track
people
around
the
world
than
the
intelligence
database
do
what
sort
of
conversation
be
oracle
have
with
the
intelligence
agency
to
improve
the
situation
the
intelligence
that
s
gather
have
to
be
analyze
efficiently
and
share
appropriately
among
the
different
agency
we
need
to
provide
the
analyst
with
the
appropriate
data
mining
and
analysis
tool
so
they
re
not
overwhelmed
by
the
sheer
amount
of
data
that
s
be
gather
that
s
what
we
focus
on
today
i
knew
that
ellison
have
be
pretty
appalled
by
the
neglect
state
of
the
fbi
s
system
after
the
chronic
underinvestment
during
the
clinton
year
the
agency
wasn
t
even
use
the
internet
to
connect
its
people
how
bad
be
it
they
re
like
most
large
company
they
have
lot
of
separate
automation
system
which
mean
their
data
be
badly
fragment
their
procedure
be
inconsistent
from
department
to
department
some
of
their
procedure
be
automate
others
be
still
manual
their
internal
network
need
to
be
upgraded
the
fbi
have
tremendous
human
resource
great
people
but
their
computer
system
be
in
desperate
need
of
modernization
the
question
be
how
quickly
can
the
fbi
s
information
management
and
communication
system
be
upgraded
that
depends
on
who
do
the
work
i
think
we
can
do
it
fast
we
can
install
a
secure
e
mail
and
document
share
system
within
ninety
day
guaranteed
that
s
easy
we
can
also
get
version
one
of
the
national
security
database
up
and
run
in
ninety
day
that
s
much
harder
we
d
have
to
use
the
oracle
database
development
team
to
do
the
work
and
we
d
have
to
work
in
shift
seven
day
a
week
twenty
four
hour
a
day
but
it
could
be
do
how
much
could
ellison
tell
me
about
the
meeting
at
the
cia
just
like
at
the
nsa
last
night
the
primary
focus
be
on
the
analyst
we
have
to
get
well
at
filter
out
the
irrelevant
information
it
really
be
the
needle
in
the
haystack
problem
except
it
s
a
really
big
haystack
call
the
planet
earth
we
re
very
good
at
collect
information
use
satellite
and
computer
but
you
have
to
organize
the
information
properly
and
you
have
to
provide
the
right
tool
so
the
analyst
can
do
their
job
you
ve
get
to
store
vast
amount
of
data
very
efficiently
or
your
data
mining
pattern
match
and
predictive
model
software
will
run
too
slowly
to
be
of
any
use
and
there
have
to
be
a
single
standard
for
exchange
information
between
intelligence
agency
when
the
cia
provide
information
to
the
fbi
about
a
bad
guy
both
agency
computer
system
need
to
be
speak
the
same
language
the
data
model
for
track
people
in
both
agency
must
be
the
same
give
the
traditional
degree
of
interagency
rivalry
and
distrust
be
the
cia
and
fbi
really
prepared
to
go
down
the
share
data
model
path
that
ellison
be
advocate
i
think
so
we
talk
about
it
at
length
in
the
meeting
at
langley
everyone
agree
and
i
expect
the
fbi
to
move
very
quickly
now
the
fbi
have
a
greatly
expand
mission
so
they
need
new
system
i
think
bob
mueller
understands
the
size
of
the
job
in
front
of
him
before
september
eleventh
you
couldn
t
get
the
first
draft
of
a
request
for
proposal
out
in
ninety
day
now
the
fbi
be
talk
about
building
a
complete
new
computer
system
in
ninety
day
i
ve
be
work
with
these
agency
the
whole
of
my
professional
life
and
i
ve
never
see
anything
like
it
these
day
everyone
in
washington
be
extremely
focus
and
work
hard
they
have
a
new
sense
of
urgency
motivate
by
a
great
and
deep
concern
about
the
security
of
our
country
they
want
to
make
sure
that
the
event
of
september
eleventh
aren
t
repeat
we
re
at
war
you
can
feel
it

ellison
s
first
appointment
in
new
york
be
to
record
an
interview
about
his
id
card
proposal
for
the
cbs
even

however
when
we
arrive
at
the
studio
on
west
fifty
seventh
street
the
place
be
in
an
uproar
the
news
have
just
broken
that
an
employee
across
the
way
at
nbc
have
contract
anthrax
poison
from
a
letter
sent
to
the
studio
there
s
great
anxiety
subsequently
confirm
that
dan
rather
the
cbs
news
star
anchorman
and
an
assistant
may
have
come
into
contact
with
a
similarly
booby
trap
letter
ellison
s
interview
with
anthony
mason
have
to
take
place
in
what
look
like
a
storeroom
because
the
studio
we
have
be
sit
in
have
to
be
swept
for
possible
contamination
despite
all
the
turmoil
the
plan
ceo
roundtable
be
schedule
to
go
ahead
among
the
guest
be
the
home
goddess
martha
stewart
and
the
ceo
of
adp
a
big
provider
of
payroll
service
ubs
painewebber
and
flower
com
also
present
be
ross
perot
jr
the
son
of
the
former
presidential
candidate
and
now
the
ceo
of
perot
system
and
lex
fenwick
an
englishman
who
be
run
the
financial
news
agency
bloomberg
while
his
bos
be
campaign
to
succeed
rudy
giuliani
as
mayor
of
new
york
but
the
person
who
be
likely
to
get
ellison
s
closest
personal
attention
be
andrew
benton
the
president
of
pepperdine
university
in
malibu
where
ellison
s
son
david
have
just
start
his
freshman
year
inevitably
they
all
want
ellison
to
talk
about
his
id
card
plan
and
the
national
security
database
that
go
with
it
and
what
sort
of
reception
ellison
s
idea
receive
in
washington
he
s
happy
to
oblige
and
of
course
it
all
neatly
segue
into
the
perennial
theme
of
the
urgent
need
to
consolidate
data
if
you
want
to
know
what
s
go
on
whether
you
re
run
a
federal
agency
or
a
business
but
when
ellison
get
on
to
tell
them
about
the
e
business
suite
and
how
it
can
help
them
both
save
money
and
get
well
information
he
sens
that
he
s
lose
their
full
attention
maybe
some
of
them
have
heard
the
pitch
while
others
find
the
idea
of
spending
a
lot
of
money
to
upgrade
their
system
with
fancy
new
software
just
plain
inappropriate
for
the
time
he
decides
to
try
something
new
even
though
jay
nussbaum
have
advise
him
against
it
because
it
hasn
t
yet
be
fully
thought
through
the
night
before
in
washington
during
a
meeting
with
diebold
a
system
integrator
specialize
in
security
and
service
atm
ellison
come
up
with
a
new
customer
offer
diebold
s
bos
wally
o
dell
told
ellison
that
while
he
didn
t
need
convincing
about
i
conceptually
he
wasn
t
in
a
mood
to
take
any
risk
when
it
come
to
uncertain
return
from
invest
in
new
software
if
ellison
really
believe
what
he
be
say
about
the
suite
what
about
shift
some
of
the
risk
to
oracle
ellison
told
o
dell
that
if
he
give
him
his
exist
it
budget
he
d
reduce
it
by
percent
each
year
for
the
next
five
year
and
provide
him
with
completely
new
system
everything
that
diebold
need
to
run
its
business
as
a
company
in
the
it
business
diebold
might
be
expect
to
have
little
enthusiasm
for
such
an
innovative
outsource
deal
but
the
opposite
be
true
o
dell
be
very
interested
indeed
and
so
be
the
ceo
in
new
york
ellison
say

the
reaction
in
the
room
be
silence
surely
it
be
too
good
to
be
true
the
devil
would
be
in
the
detail
james
mccann
of
flower
nervously
asks
whether
this
be
a
new
pricing
paradigm
totally
say
ellison
and
just
before
he
have
to
start
explain
what
he
meant
art
weinbach
the
tech
savvy
ceo
of
adp
come
to
the
rescue
this
concept
work
it
s
a
strategy
that
would
work
over
a
long
period
of
time
the
pricing
be
fascinate
ellison
relaxes
it
just
kind
of
slowly
dawn
on
me
i
have
complete
confidence
in
the
suite
approach
i
know
it
save
money
i
know
it
provide
well
information
but
how
do
i
convince
people
simple
move
the
risk
from
the
customer
to
us
guarantee
the
price
and
guarantee
the
saving
ibm
can
t
do
that
ibm
s
tell
them
to
go
best
of
breed
because
ibm
make
a
bundle
glue
it
all
together
but
the
ibm
approach
cost
a
fortune
they
can
never
compete
with
us
on
price
everything
they
do
be
one
off
custom
so
with
our
new
e
business
suite
outsource
offer
we
take
the

amsterdam
january
about
fifteen
thousand
of
the
oracle
faithful
have
gather
at
the
rai
center
in
amsterdam
for
the
european
leg
of
appsworld
the
annual
jamboree
to
evangelize
oracle
s
application
product
to
its
customer
its
partner
and
the
technology
medium
although
europe
be
sap

be
the
strong
number
two
in
most
of
the
major
european
market
other
than

where
the

from
walldorf
have
thing
pretty
well
lock
up
the
big
announcement
in
product
term
at
the
rai
be
something
that
ellison
call
daily
business
intelligence
his
big
complaint
with
business
application
be
that
although
they
have
become
quite
good
at
automate
key
process
it
s
still
extremely
difficult
to
get
any
useful
information
about
your
business
out
of
them
as
a
result
on
top
of
the
huge
sum
of
money
big
company
spend
on
application
they
also
have
to
shell
out
for
separate
data
mining
tool
and
data
warehouse
unfortunately
these
so
call
business
intelligence
product
have
some
serious
flaw
not
only
be
they
expensive
but
they
re
difficult
to
use
and
the
information
they
throw
up
be
a
snapshot
of
the
past
not
of
the
present
that
s
okay
if
you
want
to
know
everything
about
your
sale
of
say
driveshaft
in
brazil
over
the
last
three
year
but
it
s
next
to
useless
if
you
want
important
metric
at
your
fingertip
about
how
every
aspect
of
the
business
be
operating
in
real
time
ellison
have
believe
for
a
while
that
one
of
the
overwhelm
advantage
of
a
complete
and
integrate
suite
of
application
share
one
set
of
data
schema
and
run
on
top
of
a
single
database
be
that
it
would
make
it
possible
to
create
an
executive
dashboard
that
constantly
update
every
key
performance
indicator
but
what
in
theory
should
be
perfectly
doable
have
turn
out
to
be
very
hard
nonetheless
ellison
still
want
to
demonstrate
a
work
product
here
in
amsterdam
that
he
s
assure
me
will
blow
your
mind
there
be
a
couple
of
other
theme
at
amsterdam
of
at
least
equal
importance
both
aim
at
repair
some
of
the
largely
self

damage
of
the

to

a
unique

of

what
s
really
vital

though
the

several
separate

system
remains
a
complex
and
expensive
process
the
second
message
and
maybe
the
most
vital
one
be
that
the
suite
whatever
user
may
have
heard
before
be
now
fully
stable
and
deliver
real

an
ever

the
trouble
be
that
for
the
best
part
of
a
year
oracle
have
be
say
with
each
new
i
release
and
there
s
be
one
just
about
every
three
month
that
pretty
much
all
the
issue
have
be
dealt
with
even
if
what
s
be
say
be
now
completely
true
there
s
a
big
credibility
problem
one
that
oracle
itself
tacitly
acknowledges
since
the
summer
ellison
have
be
say
that
the
only
way
to
sell
the
suite
go
forward
will
be
with
a
wide
range
of
customer
reference
but
oracle
have
be
hit
by
the
double
whammy
of
still
sluggish
corporate
technology
spending
and
the
wait
and
see
approach
within
much
of
the
instal
base
which
the
press
report
about
the
difficulty
encounter
by
enthusiastic
early
adopter
have
contribute
to
this
mean
that
those
reference
that
oracle
do
have
and
there
be
now
well
over
a
thousand
mostly
satisfied
e
business
suite
user
be
be
milked
in
amsterdam
for
all
their
worth
for
several
month
the
reference
poster
child
have
be
posco
the
korean
steel
firm
that
be
also
the
world
s
big
and
most
efficient
although
the
go
live
on
i
be
back
in
july
it
s
still
one
of
the
big
big
bang
installation
to
date
but
what
s
really
make
the
oracle
exec
purr
be
that
just
in
time
for
amsterdam
posco
s
cio
have
told
them
that
the
efficiency
gain
have
be
so
spectacular
that
his
team
be
double
its
already
aggressive
forecast
of
billion
saving
over
ten
year
in
other
word
about
million
in
saving
a
year
directly
attributable
to
the
e
business
suite
you
might
never
have
heard
of
posco
but
oracle
be
do
its
damnedest
to
rectify
that
much
of
ron
wohl
s
presentation
be
devote
to
the
superiority
of
oracle
s
information
architecture
and
as
the
point
man
on
the
posco
implementation
he
also
have
plenty
to
say
about
that
it
s
a
confident
and
convincing
performance
from
somebody
who
lack
a
natural
stage
presence
backstage
after
his
presentation
i
ask
wohl
about
the
twelve
month
struggle
to
bring
i
to
maturity
after
it
become
clear
that
oracle
have
launch
a
product
that
though
conceptually
brilliant
just
wasn
t
ready
for
prime
time
he
suck
in
his
breath
and
begin
look
back
at
the
release
you
always
have
the
wisdom
of
hindsight
fundamentally
we
try
to
do
something
that
i
think
be
much
large
in
scope
than
even
we
realize
and
be
much
large
than
the
scope
of
any
software
we
have
release
beforehand
in
retrospect
we
didn
t
do
a
good
enough
job
up
front
our
qa
quality
assurance
procedure
didn
t
work
because
they
have
outgrown
our
scale
in
retrospect
i
would
have
like
to
have
do
two
thing
differently
we
should
have
change
a
number
of
process
within
development
to
deal
with
the
scale
of
the
release
which
we
have
now
do
and
two
know
what
we
know
now
we
would
have
be
wiser
to
withhold
the
release
a
little
bit
we
would
have
be
well
off
as
a
company
if
we
have
defer
the
release
by
three
or
four
month
wohl
be
ready
to
concede
that
the
heart
of
the
problem
be
the
gamble
he
and
ellison
have
take
with
the
order
management
system
it
be
one
of
the
last
part
of
the
i
software
to
be
complete
and
as
a
result
we
have
more
stability
issue
in
order
management
than
in
other
part
of
the
erp
code
but
the
stability
improve
at
a
very
rapid
pace
you
could
see
it
in
the
bug
number
and
you
could
see
it
in
the
customer
satisfaction
level
customer
who
have
start
on
a
later
version
and
above
be
extremely
happy
if
you
talk
to
customer
who
start
on
one
of
the
early
version
they
weren
t
happy
and
they
have
a
right
to
be
upset
with
us
but
we
make
it
up
to
them
by
really
go
out
of
our
way
to
help
them
through
their
difficulty
take
a
look
at
where
we
be
now
about
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
release
of
i
we
have
more
than
one
thousand
customer
live
achieve
billion
of
dollar
of
benefit
you
have
to
compare
the
problem
to
the
accomplishment
and
the
accomplishment
by
any
measure
have
be
profound
in
this
business
there
s
always
a
three
to
six
month
lag
between
perception
and
reality
we
benefit
from
that
in
the
begin
but
now
it
s
hurt
us
if
we
talk
in
three
or
four
month
the
reputation
of
our
e
business
suite
will
be
much
improve
reputation
change
very
quickly
in
our
business
right
now
the
reality
be
that
our
software
be
extraordinarily
good
our
reference
be
extraordinarily
good
and
the
demo
be
fabulous
come
out
of
this
nobody
will
be
able
to
stop
us
i
honestly
believe
that
no
one
can
match
our
software
before
there
be
a
lot
of
doubt
and
frankly
some
of
the
ongoing
skepticism
be
because
we
didn
t
do
a
good
enough
job
initially
but
now
we
ve
get
it
right
and
we
ve
prove
it
work
no
one
can
argue
with
our
live
customer
story
those
be
real
wohl
s
other
point
be
the
same
one
that
george
robert
oracle
s
top
salesman
have
make
to
me
some
month
earlier
the
suite
concept
be
win
acceptance
in
the
market
wohl
say
some
people
thought
we
be
crazy
they
say
that
no
one
company
can
do
all
that
but
look
at
what
s
happen
to
all
the
best
of
breed
vendor
except
maybe
siebel
they
ve
dive
and
hit
the
dust
they
ll
stick
around
for
a
while
but
they
be
just
not
go
to
grow
they
be
not
go
to

because
the

high
also
notice
that
sap
be
now
call
itself
an
integrate
business
suite
company
and
so
be
peoplesoft
they
ve
both
copy
our

but
they
can
t
copy
our

the

application

marketing
message
be
what
the
application
vendor
with
a

have
in

we
re
the
only
suite
with
an
information
architecture
base
on
this
single
data
model
in

our
competitor
know
it
the
value
of
the
simplicity
can
t

overestimate
this
be
what
will
allow
us
to
beat
sap
and
put
peoplesoft
to

although
in
his
quiet
way
wohl
be
as
intellectually
arrogant
as
anyone
i
ve
ever
met
he
be
not
normally
give
to
make
such
bombastic
statement
he
have
the
air
of
somebody
who
have
be
through
a
great
deal
and
now
feel
vindicate
it
isn
t
just
the
experience
of
the
previous
torrid
twelve
month
that
have
create
this
battle
harden
certainty
but
the
last
decade
when
wohl
be
held
up
for
ridicule
within
oracle
especially
by
ray
lane
and
time
and
time
again
depend
on
ellison
s
to
many
people
quite
baffling
faith
in
his
ability
for
his
survival
he
have
the
air
of
a
man
whose
moment
have
come
if
ron
wohl
have
the
scent
of
ultimate
victory
in
his
nostril
i
expect
more
of
the
same
from
the
naturally
cocky
mark
barrenechea
but
he
turn
out
to
be
far
from
happy
he
start
by
say
that
in
the
last
year
and
a
half
we
ve
do
some
brand
damage
he
put
the
blame
squarely
on
the
order
management
system
and
by
implication
on
ron
wohl
we
ve
be
in
order
management
for
fifteen
year
and
we
still
didn
t
get
it
right
we
ve
have
quality
issue
with
many
of
the
underlie
erp
component
wohl
s
side
of
the
suite
and
in
many
case
we
didn
t
even
do
damage
limitation
well
he
even
express
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
late
release
to
ship
i
have
dealt
with
all
the
problem
some
of
the
early
indicator
suggest
that
many
of
the
issue
be
behind
us
but
if
history
repeat
itself
it
s
still
go
to
take
a
lot
to
flush
them
out
when
i
ask
barrenechea
how
the
crm
module
the
part
of
the
suite
that
he
s
responsible
for
be
perform
he
vent
his
frustration
he
claim
that
because
most
of
oracle
s
fourteen
thousand
exist
application
customer
inevitably
begin
their
i
implementation
by
upgrade
their
erp
system
the
quality
problem
they
ve
hit
have
often
meant
that
the
money
run
out
before
they
even
get
to
instal
his
crm
software
by
no
mean
have
our
crm
execution
falter
not
at
all
but
in
many
case
we
don
t
even
get
to
the
start
gate
because
all
the
implementation
dollar
have
already
be
use
up
it
may
take
three
year
now
before
they
get
to
try
them
it
make
me
very
impatient
barrenechea
accuses
wohl
s
team
not
only
of
mishandle
the
major
rewrite
of
the
crucial
order
management
module
but
also
of
not
write
all
its
software
to
conform
to
the
new
trading
community
architecture
tca
or
customer
master
that
be
meant
to
be
the
basis
of
the
i
platform
he
say
we
ve
all
be
told
to
standardize
on
tca
and
yet
we
find
the
other
organization
somehow
miss
it
along
the
way
so
we
have
quite
a
bit
of
cobble
to
do
to
get
the
new
customer
master
and
the
new
order
management
work
across
crm
it
kind
of
come
down
to
bad
management
in
the
other
organization
this
be
a
pretty
serious
accusation
from
one
of
oracle
s
most
senior
executive
i
point
out
to
barrenechea
that
ellison
argues
that
the
most
important
single
contribution
he
have
make
since
become
involve
in
apps
development
in
be
to
get
the
various
part
of
the
development
organization
work
together
cooperatively
barrenechea
laugh
and
nearly
choke
on
the
cake
he
s
eat
oh
sure
it
s
a
lot
well
than
it
use
to
be
at
least
we
re
not
spit
at
each
other
anymore
look
larry
have
a
brilliance
and
he
s
certainly
a
virtuoso
when
it
come
to
understand
organizational
structure
but
he
like
see
two
organization
compete
so
fact
arise
part
of
the
difficulty
for
me
in
understand
this
be
that
it
translates
into
nonconsolidation
of
responsibility
most
company
would
consolidate
responsibility
onto
one
sale
guy
one
consult
guy
one
chief
product
developer
right
this
be
either
one
of
the
most
wonderful
characteristic
of
oracle
or
it
s
one
of
the
great
flaw
and
i
can
t
work
it
out
yet
it
s
so
larry
i
can
see
where
this
be
lead
and
sure
enough
barrenechea
say
we
need
one
application
organization
and
we
need
one
product
development
organization
that
over
time
do
not
consolidate
to
larry
and
we
have
to
envisage
an
oracle
someday
without
larry
and
be
work
toward
that
as
if
realize
that
he
may
be
overdo
the
criticism
barrenechea
return
to
his
usual
optimism
despite
all
the
problem
which
come
from
do
something
that
be
intrinsically
very
hard
he
be
convince
that
oracle
s
approach
be
absolutely
right
and
that
no
one
else
can
match
what
s
be
achieve
he
say
that
the
release
that
s
about
to
ship
i
be
work
really
well
within
oracle
smoothly
integrate
both
the
erp
and
crm
side
of
the
suite
an
indication
that
it
s
now
ready
for
very
wide
scale
deployment
he
take
particular
heart
from
what
look
like
a
major
win
over
siebel
with
at
t
s
business
service
division
the
deal
have
have
to
withstand
a
raft
of
executive
departure
at
the
crisis
torn
telco
as
well
as
the
departure
of
jay
nussbaum
on
the
oracle
sale
side
what
have
won
the
deal
for
oracle
say
barrenechea
be
its
ability
to
automate
an
entire
business
flow
from
lead
to
opportunity
to
configure
quote
to
order
to
contract
to
billing
involve
twenty
thousand
sale
representative
thus
reduce
the
process
cycle
from
five
month
to
thirty
day
come
on
top
of
the
bellsouth
deal
it
will
make
oracle
s
crm
product
very
hard
to
beat
in
the
telco
market
he
s
also
excite
about
win
business
from
dell
computer
which
have
decide
to
standardize
all
its
application
a
mix
of
bespoke
apps
and
oracle
s
product
on
oracle
s
information
architecture
give
that
dell
have
few
peer
as
a
business
process
innovator
it
s
a
major
validation
of
oracle
s
approach
mark
jarvis
the
englishman
who
spear
oracle
s
always
aggressive
marketing
effort
readily
admit
that
after
eighteen
month
of
hell
he
hop
amsterdam
would
mark
a
turn
point
he
say
i
d
never
previously
thought
that
i
might
be
fire
but
in
the
last
six
month
i
have
thought
about
it
several
time
i
m
use
to
get
occasional
note
from
larry
but
i
d
never
have
one
like
the
one
i
get
from
him
a
few
month
ago
say
that
the
marketing
be
the
bad
it
have
ever
be
and
our
press
coverage
be
the
bad
it
have
be
in
the
history
of
the
company
i
ask
ellison
later
whether
jarvis
be
in
danger
of
get
the
sack
he
say
far
from
it
he
d
weep
if
jarvis
ever
left
but
jarvis
need
well
quality
manager
at
the
level
just
below
him
especially
for
deal
with
the
medium
in
talk
about
turn
point
be
jarvis
just
whistle
to
keep
his
courage
up
he
honestly
seem
to
believe
otherwise
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
month
oracle
have
make
its
peace
with
the
system
integrator
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
usually
hostile
accenture
in
particular
both
ernst
young
and
pricewaterhousecoopers
agree
that
they
should
be
make
most
of
their
money
from
business
process
re
engineering
rather
than
customize
other
people
s
software
in
fact
i
d
recently
attend
a
very
positive
meeting
between
oracle
and
pwc
s
top
team
in
washington
d
c
and
pwc
have
be
the
lead
consultant
on
the
posco
implementation
and
in
amsterdam
i
d
talk
to
a
senior
partner
from
cap
gemini
who
be
also
sing
from
the
same
song
sheet
just
as
important
jarvis
claimed
that
most
of
the
financial
analyst
if
not
yet
the
software
industry
analyst
have
now
come
out
in
favor
of
the
suite
as
the
right
approach
over
best
of
breed
the
daily
business
intelligence
which
jarvis
and
ellison
be
demonstrate
in
amsterdam
be
a
dramatic
illustration
of
what
become
possible
with
a
single
data
model
it
be
one
thing
to
show
slide
illustrate
how
sap
s
application
ran
across
five
separate
database
link
by
clunky
message
compare
with
the
oracle
suite
s
tight
integration
with
a
single
database
it
be
rather
more
impressive
to
be
able
to
offer
something
that
be
both
spectacularly
useful
and
beyond
sap
s
capability
because
of
the
inferiority
of
its
information
architecture
the
same
could
also
be
say
of
business
flow
but
daily
business
intelligence
be
a
much
easy
concept
for
most
people
to
grasp
and
thus
to
sell
to
them
jarvis
admit
that
while
his
people
use
oracle
s
crm
software
to
gather
information
on
customer
and
target
marketing
campaign
like
most
senior
executive
he
d
never
use
it
personally
i
have
never
use
any
of
this
stuff
until
about
two
week
ago
i
m
a
total
convert
that
make
me
realize
that
it
be
all
worth
it
we
d
be
through
hell
but
wow
look
at
this
a
golden
nugget
we
ve
be
search
for
a
long
time
but
we
finally
found
the
gold
mine
later
the
same
day
ellison
use
his
keynote
to
explain
why
the
daily
business
intelligence
be
not
just
another
nice
feature
but
be
pretty
close
to
be
the
holy
grail
of
business
it
as
usual
he
blame
most
of
the
problem
afflict
business
compute
on
the
fatal
combination
of
fragment
information
and
incomplete
automation
most
business
process
be
not
completely
automate
they
re
a
combination
of
online
and
offline
activity
for
example
in
the
sale
process
call
opportunity
to
order
each
line
of
the
sale
order
be
always
enter
into
the
application
system
but
the
price
quote
and
sale
contract
might
be
store
separately
in
an
excel
file
or
a
document
image
file
if
you
store
your
price
quote
in
excel
file
that
mean
your
application
database
be
incomplete
so
you
can
t
ask
the
system
question
like
what
be
the
total
value
of
all
my
outstanding
quote
similarly
if
you
use
a
document
image
file
to
store
contract
you
cannot
ask
the
system
how
many
of
my
contract
have
nonstandard
limitation
of
liability
clause
because
that
information
be
not
store
in
the
application
database
in
other
word
if
your
process
automation
system
be
incomplete
and
most
be
then
your
application
database
will
be
incomplete
as
a
consequence
and
an
incomplete
database
make
building
a
business
intelligence
system
virtually
impossible
it
s
the
completeness
of
the
e
business
suite
s
process
automation
and
the
single
data
model
which
allows
you
to
keep
all
your
information
in
one
database
that
make
daily
business
intelligence
possible
every

this

that

you
know
you
have
a
serious

problem
that
need
to
be
fix
the
daily
business
intelligence
system
not
only
provide

with
up

it
provide
every

what
to
do
and
how
well
they
re
do
it
as
well
as
provide
detailed
almost
instantaneous
information
about
every
aspect
of
oracle
s
business
it
also
have
a
dramatic
impact
on
the
behavior
of
individual
perhaps
the
most
interest
aspect
of
daily
business
intelligence
be
the
comparison
of
your
job
performance
with
that
of
your
peer
the
reaction
to
these
ranking
be
fascinate
people
not
only
work
harder
to
move
up
in
the
ranking
they
work
smarter
they
study
the
people
with
the
best
performance
and
learn
from
them
and
everyone
get
daily
feedback
that
let
them
know
if
their
job
performance
be
improve
this
make
a
manager
s
job
much
easy
the
manager
doesn
t
have
to
constantly
tell
people
that
they
re
do
a
good
job
or
a
bad
job
the
system
do
that
when
sally
arrives
at
work
and
log
on
to
the
system
her
home
page
pop
us
and
say
hi
sally
you
rank
in
the
top
twenty
five
percent
in

congratulation

you

knock
it
off
stop
eat
at
all
those
fancy
french
restaurant
but
you
know
what
the
second
that
sally
realizes
we
can
see
how
much
she
s
spending
on
expensive
dinner
her
behavior
change
she
stop
order
the
expensive
wine
with
dinner
constant
feedback
whether
it
s
from
a
bos
a
parent
a
teacher
or
the
e
business
suite
s
daily
business
intelligence
system
encourages
people
to
improve
their
behavior
hard
fact
about
how
well
you
re
do
your
job
in
comparison
with
other
people
in
your
company
take
most
of
the
human
bias
out
of

assessment
it
doesn
t
matter
much
if
your

like
you
or
dislike
you
it
s
all
about
your

back
up
by
an
onstage
demonstration
of
how
the
executive
dashboard
work
and
how
easy
the
user
interface
make
it
to
drill
down
for
extraordinarily
fine
grain
data
ellison
s
presentation
make
a
powerful
impact
on
the
packed
hall
but
maybe
because
this
be
europe
rather
than
america
i
detect
a
slight
uneasiness
in
the
nervous
laughter
that
greets
some
of
ellison
s
joke
impressive
proof
though
daily
business
intelligence
be
of
the
compute
philosophy
behind
the
e
business
suite
how
many
people
would
really
welcome
the
introduction
of
such
brutal
transparency
into
their
work
life
if
ellison
have
his
way
it
s
something
they
ll
just
have
to
get
over
before
go
onstage
sergio
giacoletto
oracle
s
italian
head
of
european
sale
have
ask
ellison
not
to
mention
two
thing
that
be
in
the
pipeline
the
first
be
the
outsource
with
a
twist
offer
which
first
broke
cover
at
the
new
york
ceo
roundtable
back
in
october
this
be
the
deal
in
which
oracle
proposes
to
take
over
a
customer
s
entire
it
budget
and
provide
all
the
software
suite
apps
server
database
hardware
and
networking
gear
that
s
need
for
a
state
of
the
art
computer
system
each
year
for
the
five
year
term
of
the
contract
ellison
commits
to
reduce
that
it
budget
by
percent
giacoletto
reckons
that
it
will
give
oracle
a
formidable
weapon
to
fight
sap
in
the
european
midmarket
which
neither
of
the
two
rival
have
penetrate
much
but
he
want
to
announce
it
when
he
s
good
and
ready
however
when
someone
asks
about
oracle
s
asp
application
service
provider
strategy
ellison
can
t
resist
the
opportunity
to
pitch
his
new
deal
the
second
thing
that
the
oracle
exec
want
kept
under
wrap
be
a
radical
new
pricing
plan
for
the
e
business
suite
which
have
barely
be
sign
off
on
back
at
redwood
shore
but
at
the
press
conference
after
his
keynote
speech
once
again
ellison
can
t
help
himself
from
now
on
he
declares
the
e
business
suite
will
be
sell
to
every
customer
in
its
entirety
and
there
will
be
just
two
license
price
a
year
for
power
user
and
for
occasional
user
what
it
mean
for
the
customer
be
that
it
will
no
longer
be
necessary
to
work
out
minutely
in
advance
what
module
in
the
suite
be
likely
to
be
need
and
how
many
license
should
be
purchase
say
for
financial
user
or
sale
force
user
as
ellison
say
our
pricing
didn
t
match
our
product
our
product
be
an
integrate
suite
but
our
pricing
be
component
by
component
that
meant
when
you
be
buying
the
suite
you
have
to
decide
in
advance
how
many
user
to
buy
for
each
application
component
marketing
sale
service
financial
manufacturing
and
so
on
if
you
guess
wrong
you
have
to
come
back
and
negotiate
a
new
license
in
other
word
customer
have
to
predict
their
future
business
need
and
process
in
a
way
that
be
inherently
spurious
from
now
on
they
would
be
able
to
turn
on
whatever
part
of
the
suite
their
evolve
requirement
justified
and
user
would
be
allow
access
to
any
application
they
want
to
work
with
from
oracle
s
perspective
the
new
pricing
model
make
even
well
sense
the
bundling
of
feature
into
the
database
and
the
apps
server
that
customer
could
either
use
or
not
use
be
a
neat
way
of
lock
competitor
out
of
profitable
niche
market
as
microsoft
have
prove
over
and
over
again
the
legal
difference
be
that
sadly
for
ellison
oracle
be
not
a
monopoly
if
an
erp
customer
have
already
instal
the
whole
suite
and
be
think
about
deploy
crm
why
not
just
switch
on
the
oracle
stuff
it
already
have
rather
than
go
to
all
the
bother
of
buying
and
implement
a
system
from
siebel
the
new
pricing
model
leveraged
the
completeness
of
the
suite
without
impose
it
there
be
two
far
advantage
from
ellison
s
point
of
view
first
it
would
no
longer
be
a
stretch
to
claim
every
i
customer
as
a
suite
customer
second
it
might
help
to
diminish
some
of
the
internal
snip
between
the
wohl
and
barrenechea
team
ellison
told
me
later
we
ll
now
be
measure
suite
sale
in
total
rather
than
erp
and
crm
sale
separately
that
should
take
some
of
the
edge
off
the
intramural
competition
that
s
be
go
on
between
the
different
application
development
group
when
a
customer
buy
the
entire
suite
our
sale
system
will
record
it
as
a
suite
sale
but
our
support
system
will
tell
us
exactly
which
application
in
the
suite
be
actually
be
use
ellison
s
premature
announcement
at
the
press
conference
have
two
effect
one
predictable
the
other
less
so
the
first
be
to
send
oracle
s
marketing
machine
into
a
spin
when
ellison
start
to
reveal
the
new
pricing
plan
mark
jarvis
exclaim
oh
my
god
he
say
he
wasn
t
go
to
do
it
he
always
do
this
this
will
be
run
on
the
wire
and
the
press
will
start
call
safra
in
a
couple
of
hour
it
be
still
a
m
in
california
and
she
won
t
know
what
the
hell
s
go
on
jarvis
have
to
prepare
a
detailed
press
statement
in
a
couple
of
hour
the
second
more
positive
be
that
for
the
first
time
in
a
large
gathering
of
skeptical
journalist
not
a
single
question
about
the
value
of
the
suite
versus
best
of
breed
have
be
ask
a
corner
turn
on
the
plane
from
amsterdam
to
london
i
discuss
the
last
few
day
with
ellison
include
an
edit
version
of
barrenechea
s
attack
on
ron
wohl
as
to
the
latter
his
reply
be
terse
you
know
mark
barrenechea
be
a
very
smart
guy
and
he
have
some
interest
theory
that
explain
our
crm
sale
result
indeed
our
crm
sale
be
influence
by
lot
of
thing
beyond
mark
s
control
the
quality
of
our
erp
software
the
size
and
experience
of
our
crm
sale
force
the
state
of
the
economy
and
the
relative
strength
of
the
crm
competition
i
ask
him
whether
he
agree
with
jarvis
that
oracle
have
suffer
real
brand
damage
during
the
last
twelve
month
he
sigh
the
expression
brand
damage
have
come
from
him
a
few
month
earlier
when
he
have
want
to
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
quality
issue
affect
some
i
customer
be
the
override
priority
for
development
we
be
all
very
pleased
with
the
progress
be
make
on
our
application
product
quality
issue
but
i
didn
t
want
to
let
up
i
want
our
developer
to
stay
intensely
focus
on
quality
quality
quality
so
i
casually
say
that
the
early
version
of
i
have
do
some
brand
damage
to
oracle
and
to
repair
that
damage
we
d
have
to
constantly
improve
quality
i
m
sorry
i
ever
use
the
expression
brand
damage
the
phrase
brand
damage
caught
on
and
everyone
start
use
it
a
negative
article
in
the
press
cause
brand
damage
a
sale
didn
t
close
because
of
brand
damage
i
ve
be
plague
by
the
expression
brand
damage
ever
since
i
first
use
it
never
use
catchy
phrase
to
describe
something
negative
about
your
own
company
aim
the
dark
marketing
at
the
competition
not
yourself
interestingly
ellison
add
that
the
rollout
of
daily
business
intelligence
within
oracle
have
make
it
much
easy
to
dig
down
into
find
where
the
problem
be
and
who
should
be
responsible
for
fix
them
the
transparency
end
what
have
be
a
blame
game
between
support
and
development
for
all
that
i
suggest
that
from
what
i
have
see
over
the
last
few
day
of
oracle
s
customer
and
integration
partner
the
technology
press
and
even
some
of
the
analyst
the
idea
that
a
corner
have
be
turn
in
amsterdam
didn
t
seem
far
fetch
ellison
want
to
agree
but
he
also
want
to
put
thing
into
context
a
big
technology
transition
a
massive
rewrite
of
one
of
our
major
product
happens
infrequently
once
every
ten
or
fifteen
year
when
it
do
happen
it
put
a
huge
strain
on
us
and
our
customer
it
s
a
little
bit
like
childbirth
it
s
painful
for
what
seem
like
a
very
long
time
but
the
pain
be
suddenly
forgotten
when
you
see
the
beautiful
baby
when
oracle
come
out
nobody
remember
the
pain
of
oracle
rewrite
the
application
be
a
much
easy
transition
than
rewrite
the
database
but
nobody
remembers
the
extent
of
the
problem
we
have
with
version
of
the
database
everyone
s
repress
it
it
s
just
fascinate
somebody
say
to
jeff
henley
oh
my
god
this
be
as
bad
as
the
database
rewrite
back
in
jeff
and
i
have
to
laugh
during
the
database
rewrite
we
almost
go
bankrupt
today
we
have
billion
in
cash
and
profit
margin
of
around
thirty
five
percent
but
more
important
we
now
have
the
only
suite
of
application
integrate
around
a
single
application
database
we
have
the
only
application
database
with
built
in
business
intelligence
in
other
word
we
have
the
smartest
best
look
baby
in
town
maybe
the
only
thing
that
matter
be
a
return
to
sale
growth
ellison
have
say
to
me
more
than
once
that
the
one
thing
that
would
make
a
difference
be
a
quarter
that
beat
expectation
analyst
don
t
try
to
foretell
the
future
they
try
to
explain
the
recent
past
if
you
have
a
series
of
bad
quarter
they
explain
that
it
must
be
because
you
have
product
problem
if
you
then
have
a
series
of
good
quarter
they
explain
that
it
s
because
you
ve
overcome
your
product
problem
they
ll
conclude
that
our
e
business
suite
product
problem
be
over
when
we
start
grow
faster
than
our
application
competitor
it
s
that
simple
they
just
look
at
the
number

the
tension
in
amsterdam
between
ron
wohl
and
mark
barrenechea
would
soon
be
resolve
get
daily
business
intelligence
to
perform
all
its
trick
prove
to
be
difficult
and
as
a
consequence
soon
after
return
to
redwood
shore
ellison
threw
himself
into
the
effort
to
get
the
product
finish
we
be
get
most
of
the
data
we
want
out
of
daily
business
intelligence
but
not
everything
there
be
some
data
that
i
consider
very
important
that
we
be
unable
to
track
for
some
reason
i
want
to
understand
why
as
usual
when
an
engineering
problem
struck
he
insist
on
embark
on
a
process

it
expose
weakness
in
the

the

that
neither

the
more
alarmed
he

by

i
have
found
a
couple
of
database
schema
error
that
seem
to
be
the
source
of
the
daily

i

work
on

schema

be
only
a
symptom
of
the
real
underlie
problem
the

crm
component
of
the
suite
be
not
as
tightly
integrate
as
they
should
have
be
because
our
two
development
team
be
not
work
as
closely
together
as
i
thought
they
be
i
discover
i
have
a
serious
organizational
problem
in

i
should
have
see
it
and
fix
it
a

i
totally
screw
up
it
may
have
take
ellison
longer
than
it
should
have
to
discover
the
defect
in
his
application
development
organization

once
he
do
he
act
decisively
ellison
say
once
it
s
clear
to
me
that
i
ve
make
a
mistake
i
move
pretty
quickly
to
fix
it
he

that

in

sexier

that
it
be
nonetheless
a
lot
easy
to
do
i
believe
that

easy

the
key
crm

should
not

separate
from

we
get
ourselves
into
trouble
when
we
try

initiative
why
oracle
be
willing
to
do
the

be
another
matter
it
be
get
paid
only
million
to
allow
up
to
people
to
use
its

for
ten
year

support
and
maintenance
which
include

the

version
of

me
it

a
spectacular
deal
for

a

deal

it

not

good
deal
for

even
at
the
time
plenty
of
people
at
oracle
include
ellison
thought
the
contract
be
far
too
generous
and
an
example
of
precisely
the
kind
of
scorch
earth
deal
in

which

actively
campaign
against
if

the

would

very
different

the

guy
from

who

in

you
would
instantly
realize
if
you
saw
them
be
just
not
capable

besides
kevin

that
the

the
way
howle

bad
from

there

by
both

the

ask
us
to
take
over
the

and
that
s
what
we
do
i
don

that
our

team
met
with
the

for
more
than
a

yet
they

just
how
do
they
manage
to
do
that
in

horrify
by
the

barry
keene
that
he
be

to
scrap
the

i
say
we
d
be
happy
to
undo
the

if
they
want
to
undo
it
but
they
say
no
we
love
the

we
don
t
want
to
undo
it
we
ll
stick
by
it
that
be
consistent
with
keene
s
official
response
to
the
auditor
while
agree
that
there
be
some
step
that
need
to
be
take
to
ensure
that
the
state
receive
full
value
he
continued
to
maintain
that
the
saving
would
be
very
substantial
the
auditor
s
report
be
all
florez
need
for
his

to
embark
upon
lengthy

politically
charge

that

florez
make
no
bone
about
his
belief
that
davis
ran

incompetent

the

that

present
himself
as

both
valiant
for

and
the
victim
of

when

spokesman
jim

say
that
not

be
his
company
ready
to
rescind

several
week
earlier
nobody
in
davis
s
office
could
recollect
such
an
offer
be
make
another
interpretation
of
davis
s
action
be
that
he
panicked
from
oracle
s
point
of
view
davis
have
help
stir
in
a
far
dash
of
toxicity
to
the
already
seethe
cauldron
by
lending
his
weight
to
the
idea
that
some
kind
of
crime
have
be
commit
by
talk
about
shred
because
of
the
need
to

doit
barry
goode
the

throw
fuel
on
the
flame
as
far
as
the
check
from
oracle
be
concerned
although
it
be
make
to
look
bad
it
s
doubtful
whether
anyone
really
believe
that
there
be
a
connection
between
it
and
the
ela
in
the
first
place
compare
with
the
size
of
the
contract
not
to
mention
oracle
s
size
and
profitability
it
be
a
piddle
amount
second
the
check
have
be
promise
at
a
fund
raise
dinner
organize
by
ed
the
big
system
integrator
it
be
neither
the
big
nor
the
small
amount
pledge
that
night
by
thirty
tech
firm
ken
glueck
point
out
that
as
well
as
be
a
rather
small
scale
political
contributor
the
only
state
where
oracle
make
any
contribution
at
all
be
california
and
virginia
where
in
both
case
it
be
a
substantial
employer
if
oracle
be
in
the
business
of
buying
contract
surely
it
would
be
politically
active
everywhere
it
sell
software
but
for
a
number
of
reason
the
check
still
didn
t
look
good
although
it
have
be
issue
in
march
the
fact
that
it
have
be
hand
over
just
as
a
major
deal
be
closing
be
enough
to
raise
suspicion
glueck
say
ravi
mehta
do
nothing
illegal
but
he
show
bad
judgment
first
by
hold
on
to
the
check
when
he
shouldn
t
have
second
by
give
it
to
baheti
in
a
restaurant
which
of
course
become
a
bar
in

meanwhile
the
circus
in

with
dean

as

drag
on
work
its
way
through
a
mass
of
evidence

witness
all
calculate
to
denigrate
the
davis
administration
and
to
add

to

s
misery
not
all
of
it
go
florez

way
he
have
boast
that
ohio
north

montana
as
well
as
the
city
of
toronto
would
testify
damningly
about
their

with

have
see
what

go
on
in

those

elect
to
put
their
relationship

ben
piscitelli
a
spokesman
for
the
ohio
department
of

service
say
we
continue
to
have
a
normal
business
relationship
with
oracle
this
really
be
a
california
versus
oracle
issue
and
we
re
leave
it
at
that
but
florez
be
win
some
round
committee
investigator
dug
up
some
incriminate
e

from
the
unfortunate
mehta
date
january
mehta
s
e
mail
to
robert
hoffman
oracle
s
director
of
legislative
affair
list
nine
state
politician
who
in
mehta
s
view
be
important
to
oracle
and
should
be
give
money
oracle
s
response
be
to
say
that
mehta
s
suggestion
have
at
the
time
be
ignore
but
when
mehta
appear
under
subpoena
take
the
fifth
amendment
it
make
it
look
as
if
there
have
be
some
kind
of
cover
up
glueck
suspect
that
mehta
refuse
to
testify
because
of
irregularity
in
his
reporting
of
invoice
glueck
reckon
that
he
must
have
be
rip
off
oracle
by
claim
expense
that
he
hadn
t
incur
or
that
he
have
fail
to
report
them
and
be
guilty
of
noncompliance
glueck
didn
t
think
and
certainly
hop
that
mehta
s
reticence
have
anything
to
do
with
the
ela
contract
on
may
glueck
terminate
mehta
s
contract
with
oracle
he
say
in
hindsight
ravi
work
for
us
be
probably
a
mistake
if
mehta
be
an
embarrassment
everyone
at
oracle
be
furious
that
the
committee
attack
their
company
mercilessly
but
give
it
no
opportunity
to
defend
itself
there
be
two
particular
bone
of
contention
the
first
be
florez
s
intention
to
call
only
five
relatively
junior
oracle
salesman
who
have
be
involve
in
the
deal
to
testify
and
his
refusal
to
allow
them
to
make
any
opening
statement
oracle
insist
that
a
senior
sale
executive
kevin
fitzgerald
accompany
them
and
be
allow
at
least
fifteen
minute
to
state
oracle
s
position
oracle
be
also
adamant
that
information
that
florez
be
demand
about
the
salesman
s
personal
remuneration
on
the
deal
be
a
breach
of
confidentiality
that
would
leave
it
open
to
legal
action
by
its
own
employee
the
second
spat
be
over
florez
s
lack
of
interest
in
hearing
former
state
auditor
kurt
sjoberg
s
very
different
analysis
of
the
value
of
the
deal
to
the
state
at
the
end
of
may
the
usually
mild
mannered
jeff
henley
fire
off
a
splenetic
letter

the
reason

cannot
be
place
in
question
despite
that
cooperation
we
have
be
told
repeatedly
by
member
of
the
medium
that
you
as
chairman
of
the
jlac
have
characterize
oracle
as
uncooperative
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
truth
on
april
just
two
day
after
the
bsa
report
be
release
oracle
write
to
the
state
auditor
and
the
jlac
point
out
a
specific
material
error
in
the
bsa
report

single
error

the
value
of
the

from
the

estimate
of
a

have
refuse
to

and
have
refer
us
to
the
jlac
to
discus
question
related
to
the

proposition
of
the

we
have
ask
the

for
the
opportunity
to
discus
this

error
in
public
at
the

we
have
be
told
by
your

that
the

that
discussion
moreover
we
have
request
numerous
meeting
with
the
jlac
and
have
be
told
that
you
as
chairman
will
not
meet
with
oracle
it
be
unheard
of
perhaps
unprecedented
that
the
subject
of
an
audit
report
be
not
give
a
single
opportunity
to
engage
in
a

discussion
about
the

we
believe
that
the
material

in
our
letter
of
april
th
be
only
one
of
many
such
issue
that
deserve
serious
and
thoughtful
attention
from
the
jlac
during
the
process
of
these
hearing
you
as
chairman
have
unjustly
accuse
oracle
of
many
thing
and
have
permit
the
hearing
record
to
be
fill
with
ream
of
undocumented
innuendo
and
speculation
oracle
have
repeatedly
ask
you
as
chairman
for
the
opportunity
to
have
a
senior
oracle
executive
address
the
committee
it
be
inconceivable
to
oracle
that
after
nearly
hour
of
committee
hearing
in
six
week
the
committee
cannot
find
the
time
to
give
the
subject
of
those
hearing
a
single
opportunity
to
present
its
view
we
believe
that
as
a
historical
matter
of
legislative
investigation
in
sacramento
and
nationally
this
position
be
unprecedented
your
refusal
to
schedule
this
hearing
reflect
poorly
on
the
entire
legislature
and
call
directly
into
question
your
motif
for
hold
these
hearing
oracle
have
be
inform
by
the
committee
that
when
oracle
s
sale
staff
do
testify
they
will
not
be
allow
to
address
the
committee
with
even
a
brief
opening
statement
again
this
be
unprecedented
even
the
most
notoriously
unfair
legislative
investigation
in
the
history
of
our
country
such
as
the
house
un
american
activity

its
witness
to
make
opening
statement
a
fifteen
minute
opening
statement
by
the
witness
would
permit
oracle
to
at
least
frame
those

it
believe
the
committee
should
review
in
any
search
for
the
truth
about
the

have
formally
ask
you
as

staff
will
be
permit
to
address
the
value
proposition
of
the

during
the

this
be
the
central
issue
in
the
bsa
report
as
we
have
sought
to
explain
to
the
committee
oracle
firmly
believe
that
the
ela
will
save
california
taxpayer
in
excess
of
million
this
request
be
reject
by
your

ask
former
state
auditor
mr
kurt
sjoburg
to
perform
an
independent
analysis
of

the

information
technology
the
department

to
provide
other

the
jlac
misstate
and
misrepresent
oracle
s
position
before
the
joint
rule
committee
as
a
result
in
our
view
you
as

sought
to
seek

than
to

most
recent
document

ellison
that
oracle
have
not
receive
a
fair
shake
from
his

the

be

harsh

inaccurate

on

that

who
be
in

not

very
late
in

do
get
a
hearing
for
its
side
of

finally
take
the
stand
for
oracle
sjoberg
walk
the
committee
through
his
rigorously
conduct
twenty
five
page
audit
on
the
deal
patiently
try
to
explain
the
difference
between
his
conclusion
and
howle
s
he
point
out
that
howle
have
not
actually
attempt
to
analyze
the
value
of
the
contract
but
instead
have
simply
try
to
check
the
accuracy
of
the
projection
originally
make
at
the
time
the
state
first
consider
the
contract
not
only
do
the
audit
bureau
have
far
less
complete
information
than
his
team
have
be
able
to
extract
from
oracle
but
its
whole
methodology
have
be
fundamentally
different
and
in
his
view
consequently
flaw
in
an
article
for
the
san
francisco
chronicle
three
week
earlier
sjoberg
have
spell
out
those
difference
and
why
howle
s
calculation
make
little
sense
among
howle
s
mistake
she
have
chosen
fiscal
as
the
baseline
year
a
period
cover
nine
month
of
calendar
a
time
when
public
sector
it
budget
have
be
almost
wholly
dedicate
to
prevent
millennium
bug
meltdown
ellison
say
the
two
audit
report
come
to
diametrically
opposite
conclusion
therefore
one
of
the
two
auditor
must
have
be
wildly
mistaken
in
their
analysis
and
calculation
of
saving
sjoberg
have
about
twenty
year
experience
as
state
auditor
while
howle
be
brand
new
to
the
job
it
be
obvious
to
anyone
who
bother
to
read
both
report
which
one
be
right
sjoberg
s
report
be
casually
and
rather
disgracefully
dismiss
by
florez
after
sit
through
nine
hour
of
testimony
my
conclusion
be
that
we
stand
by
the
state
auditor
s
report
you
get
the
number
you
pay
for
and
oracle
get
those
number
and
he
be
equally
unimpressed
by
the
evidence
from
kevin
fitzgerald
about
oracle
s
minimal
involvement
in
draw
up
the
contract
other
member
of
the
committee
however
have
the
decency
to
look
a
little
uncomfortable
ellison
observe
when
the
fact
finally
come
out
florez
found
it
hard
to
completely
ignore
them
but
he
try
when
dean
florez
finally
call
it
a
day
on
june
after
two
month
thirty
witness
and
more
than
page
of
document
there
be
still
no
smoking
gun
most
critically
nobody
have
be
able
to
make
any
connection
between
the
contract
and
the
buying
of
lawmaker
influence
as
one
headline
have
optimistically
put
it
florez
conclude
i
think
we
get
take
to
the
cleaner
if
we
have
accomplish
anything
i
hope
it
be
to
warn
state
official
that
the
next
time
a
smelly
deal
cross
your
desk
at
the
eleventh
hour
you
d
well
do
what
s
right
instead
of
what
s
politically
convenient
but
he
tacitly
admit
failure
when
he
decide
to
close
the
investigation

it
s
also
unclear
whether

be
to
blame
for
the

trust
of
the

cost

if

simply
gotten
her
sum

also
have
add
in
the

there
be
no

out

we
don
t
think
ibm
gain
in
the
last

although
they
do
in
the
previous
year
when
oracle
be

focus
on
dotcoms
and
raise
price
too
aggressively
but
even
then
it
be
a
small
gain
we
tend
to
look
to
actual

that

more
realistic

still
around
share
microsoft

the

more
than

because
some

use
more

this
be
a
number
and
marketing
game
between
microsoft
ibm
and
oracle
that
have
go
on
for

oracle
have
no
flexibility
since
its

must
be

large
competitor
that
can
allocate

the

microsoft

which
be
why
they
keep
play
it
and
there
be
no
downside
for
them
since
journalist

market
analyst
pretty
much
print
the

they
be
provide
however
just
as
more
analytical
reporting
of
the

would
have
spoil
the

for

at

the
sheer
capriciousness
of
event

with
the

hostility
toward

business
have
shaken
him
when
we
met
in
london
late
in
june
i
be
struck
by
how
gloomy
he
seem
he
told
me
i
m
not
depressed
exactly
i
m
just
tire
and
i
feel
vulnerable
like
a
zebra
on
the
savanna
at
night
there
be
a
lot
of
hungry
animal
out
there
hunt
they
d
like
to

me
and
my
family
i
have
to
be
alert
and
i
have
to
stay
alert
all
night
and
this

go
to
be
a
very
very
long
night
when

the

upset

beating

and

by

but
the

rather
undermined
by

s
downbeat
forecast
the
market
take
fright
at
his
view
that
first
quarter
license
revenue
could
be
anything
between
and
percent
down
send
the
company
s
already
sag
stock
price
to
little
more
than
even
prompt
ellison
to
talk
about
his
prospect
in
the
america
s
cup
just
three
month
away
didn
t
seem
to
lighten
his
mood
yet
only
a
few
week
later
ellison
give
what
carolyn
balkenhol
among
others
thought
be
one
of
his
feistiest
and
most
compelling
performance
at
oracle
s
analyst
day
nearly
three
hundred
analyst
and
reporter
have
show
up
at
oracle
s
conference
center
expect
to
put
ellison
on
the
rack
typically
he
come
out
fight
with
plenty
of
joke
and
a
major
product
announcement
the
big
news
be
the
launch
of
what
oracle
be
call
its
collaboration
suite
a
software
package
that
combine
e
mail
voice
mail
calendar
schedule
file
share
and
an
enterprisewide
search
engine
all
accessible
by
wireless
but
this
wasn
t
just
any
old
product
announcement
what
really
juiced
it
up
be
that
the
collaboration
suite
be
target
at
a
major
microsoft
business
for
all
the
rivalry
between
the
world
s
two
big
software
firm
over
architectural
issue
the
internet
versus
client
server
and
more
recently
net
versus
the

ee
java

and
microsoft
s
persistent
harry
of
the
low
end
of
oracle
s
business
with
its
sql
server
database
this
be
the
first
time
that
oracle
have
go
directly
after
a
big
chunk
of
redmond
s
revenue
since
the
previous
summer
ellison
have
be
tout
the
advantage
of
run
e
mail
on
top
of
oracle
s
database
rather
than
employ
the
hundred
of
microsoft
exchange
server
that
be
common
in
most
big
company
keep
microsoft
s
outlook
as
your
desktop
e
mail
interface
he
d
be
say
but
replace
microsoft
exchange
with
oracle
s
e
mail
server
and
get
the
virus
protection
security
reliability
and
ease
of
administration
that
come
with
our
database
in
addition
to

include
a
new

system
for

and
search
all
your
pc

regardless
of
format
in
other
word
oracle
s
collaboration
suite
wasn
t
just
a
replacement
for
microsoft
s
exchange
server
it
be
a
replacement
for
microsoft
s
file
server
as
well
a
year
earlier
i
d
be
with
ellison
in
a
meeting
with
ned
johnson
the
chairman
of
america
s
big
mutual
fund
fidelity
investment
ellison
have
dubbed
microsoft
s
e
mail
server
software
the
virus
exchange
and
have
ask
johnson
if
he
knew
how
much
he
be
pay
for
this
truly
terrible
system
johnson
s
cio
have
figure
maybe
as
much
as
million
a
year
ellison
have
immediately
offer
to
write
johnson
out
a
personal
check
for
that
amount
if
he
couldn
t
save
him
at
least
percent
of
the
cost
while
replace
it
with
something
much
well
it
be
the
same
pitch
he
d
make
a
few
month
later
to
tommy
thompson
in
washington
d
c
it
be
a
pretty
good
way
of
get
the
customer
s
attention
unfortunately
at
that
stage
oracle
didn
t
have
a
complete
product
although
it
have
the
e
mail
and
the
file
system
it
lack
a
calendar
critical
for
coordinate
meeting
travel
and
appointment
oracle
s
developer
have
discover
that
although
microsoft
s
outlook
e
mail
interface
support
e
mail
server
use
either
the
standard
imap
internet
message
protocol
or
microsoft
s
proprietary
mapi
protocol
the
moment
you
put
an
imap
e
mail
server
such
as
oracle
s
underneath
outlook
microsoft
s
calendar
server
automatically
turn
off
the
result
be
that
oracle
s
e
mail
server
and
microsoft
s
calendar
server
wouldn
t
work
together
ellison
observe
microsoft
be
incapable
of
compete
fairly
first
they
bundle
their
outlook
e
mail
interface
with
window
so
everyone
get
outlook
for
free
then
if
you
use
the
free
outlook
as
your
e
mail
interface
microsoft
make
it
as
difficult
as
possible
to
use
any
e
mail
server
other
than
theirs
microsoft
may
claim
that
outlook
work
with
industry
standard
imap
e
mail
server
like
oracle
but
if
actually
you
try
to
use
one
everything
else
break
this
isn
t
bundling
this
be
graduate
level
bundling
they
re
the
world
s
expert
they
should
host
a
symposium
on
bundling
theory
they
have
load
of
land
mine
bury
in
their
software
to
blow
up
the
competition
it
s
illegal
but
they
d
gotten
away
with
it
for
year
so
we
have
to
figure
out
a
way
around
the
problem
the
solution
in
june
be
to
buy
a
little
canadian
company
name
steltor
that
claimed
to
make
the
best
open
system
time
management
communication
solution
on
the
market
and
have
a
formidable
customer
base
that
include
bmw
verizon
texas
instrument
and
kellogg
best
of
all
steltor
s
software
fully
support
every
one
of
outlook
s
feature
it
be
oracle
s
key
to
microsoft
s
door
suddenly
all
the
piece
work
together
the
collaboration
suite
wasn
t
just
a
welcome
stick
to
beat
microsoft
with
for
year
ellison
have
be
argue
that
microsoft
s
low
price
high
volume
model
wasn
t
all
it
seem
because
it
brought
with
it
so
much
complexity
that
have
to
be
expensively
manage
but
now
he
be
explicitly
try
to
beat
microsoft
at
its
own
game
and
he
be
determine
to
enjoy
himself
in
front
of
the
assemble
analyst
okay
here
s
where
we
have
some
fun
just
for
the
heck
of
it
we
decide
to
price
collaboration
suite
with
all
its
feature
at
one
third
of
what
microsoft
charge
just
for
its
e
mail
server
alone
bill
say
that
microsoft
s
the
place
to
go
for
low
price
software
really
not
anymore
collaboration
suite
include
a
secure
reliable
database
e

plus
the
best
calendar
scheduler
in

keep
use
outlook
say
good
bye
to
virus
with
oracle
collaboration
suite
to
cap
even
that
ellison
have
a
far
offer
for
a
user
per
month
oracle
would
supply
a
completely
outsource
service
launch
the
collaboration
suite
have
allow
ellison
to
do
one
of
the
thing
that
in
front
of
an
audience
he
be
great
at
make
joke
about
gate
but
it
also
help
him
make
a
much
more
serious
point
oracle
might
think
that
it
didn
t
need
lesson
from
microsoft
about
building
software
but
it
could
learn
a
great
deal
from
the
business
strategy
that
have
make
gate
s
firm
one
of
the
world
s
most
fearsome
competitor
from
now
on
ellison
be
say
microsoft
would
be
the
model
for
the
way
oracle
would
do
business
it
have
start
with
the
e
business
suite
but
now
in
everything
that
oracle
do
it
would
emphasize
the
same
tight
integration
that
microsoft
understood
so
well
the
same
determination
to
throw
in
a
bewildering
array
of
feature
that
small
rival
have
to
charge
for
the
same
aggressive
pricing
and
ruthless
pursuit
of
volume
ellison
told
the
analyst
our
strategy
in
enterprise
software
be
integrate
suite
with
a
low
total
cost
of
ownership
the
only
software
company
we
worry
about
watch
and
try
to
learn
from
be
microsoft
we
think
their
basic
model
integrate
suite
low
price
high
volume
be
the
winner
nothing
else
work
and
that
s
where
we
re
go
in
the
end
there
will
be
just
three
software
infrastructure
company
microsoft
and
their
proprietary
window
and
net
stuff
and
ibm
and
oracle
support
linux
java
and
open
system
that
s
it
nobody
else
if
anyone
in
the
audience
disagreed
they
weren
t
say
so
the
toughest
question
ellison
face
be
about
the
impact
on
oracle
of
compete
in
the
america
s
cup
after
get
a
pas
on
win
four
world
maxi
yacht
title
in
recent
year
ellison
say
he
d
be
hop
for
the
same
on
the
america
s
cup
but
it
s
just
much
more
visible
however
he
didn
t
think
it
would
be
that
bad
eight
week
of
drive
and
race
max
over
this
year
and
next
year
and
that
s
only
if
we
win
most
year
ellison
say
he
take
five
week
out
of
the
office
on
vacation
as
he
d
be
work
through
august
he
didn
t
think
he
d
have
more
time
away
from
the
office
than
usual
however
if
oracle
bmw
race
go
all
the
way
ellison
would
be
in
auckland
for
around
eight
week
in
and
another
four
week
in
luckily
none
of
the
analyst
seem
to
have
consult
the
official
race
calendar
and
the
dog
that
didn
t
bark
throughout
the
entire
day
there
be
just
one
question
about
the
effect
on
oracle
s
business
of
the
state
of
california
contract
scandal
would
oracle
find
itself
in
the
penalty
box
with
some
state
and
agency
not
at
all
reply
kevin
fitzgerald
smoothly
even
in
california
itself
he
expect
to
see
new
revenue
in
the
current
quarter
as
for
other
public
sector
customer
fitzgerald
say
most
agency
and
government
entity
recognize
it
for
what
it
be
they
ask
you
what
lesson
you
learn
you
say
don
t
get
in
the
way
of
an
ambitious
politician
and
don
t
become
an
issue
in
a
gubernatorial
election
year

that
fact

come

session
everyone
s
expect
a
close
and
hard
fought
battle
between
the
two
favorite
after
the
press
conference
at
which
ellison
unassumingly
sits
in
the
audience
dickson
come
over
to
katana
to
brief
his
bos
on
how
thing
have
go
in
ellison
s
absence
during
the
fortnight
s
lull
in
the
race
although
dickson
never
loses
his
intensity
by
his
standard
he
seem
pretty
relaxed
and
brimming
with
confidence
he
say
that
the
team
have
be
work
well
together
and
have
extract
some
useful
extra
speed
from
the
boat
although
he
have
a
huge
amount
of
respect
for
alinghi
the
swiss
boat
be
actually
dominate
by
the
kiwi
who
won
the
last
america
s
cup
in
particular
through
the
partnership
of
skipper
russell
coutts
and
tactician
brad
butterworth
controversially
lure
by
bertarelli
with
a
check
for
million
his
body
language
suggests
that
he
expect
to
win
in
term
of
sheer
boat
speed
all
the
evidence
suggests
that
unless
one
or
the
other
side
have
hit
on
an
especially
effective
tweak
alinghi
and
oracle
bmw
should
be
pretty
evenly
match
bruce
farr
have
deliver
a
more
than
competitive
design
but
usa
be
not
quite
as
ellison
earlier
brag
a
take
your
blazer
to
the
cleaner
boat
meaning
one
that
be
so
far
out
ahead
that
all
you
have
to
worry
about
be
look
your
best
when
receive
the
cup
both
be
optimize
for
sail
upwind
to
try
to
grab
crucial
advantage
between
the
start
and
round
the
first
mark
where
race
be
frequently
won
and
lose
but
after
oracle
lose
four
out
of
five
race
between
the
end
of
the
first
round
robin
and
the
begin
of
the
second
its
sail
have
gotten
big
and
the
massive
bulb
on
its
keel
lighter
in
a
bid
to
improve
its
light
air
and
downwind
performance
but
the
real
worry
be
more
to
do
with
the
crew
than
the
boat
ellison
sum
it
up
alinghi
run
like
a
fine
swiss
watch
we
re
more
like
an
american
daytime
tv
soap
opera
the
problem
have
be
there
since
the
very
begin
the
decision
to
buy
the
two
boat
from
the
americaone
syndicate
which
have
lose
in
have
turn
out
to
be
a
double
edge
sword
it
meant
that
ellison
s
team
have
gotten
onto
the
water
early
give
them
a
head
start
in
training
and
development
but
the
boat
have
brought
with
them
their
skipper
paul
cayard
and
most
of
his
lose
crew
right
from
the
get
go
cayard
s
american
and
the
new
zealander
who
have
come
from
sayonara
didn
t
get
along
but
the
big
point
of
friction
be
between
dickson
and
cayard
whose
different
style
and
rivalry
prove
an
impossible
combination
even
ellison
s
removal
of
cayard
a
man
he
d
never
much
like
by
lock
him
in
golden
handcuff
and
push
him
off
the
team
have
fail
to
bring
harmony
ellison
told
me
there
be
a
lot
of
infighting
between
the
americaone
guy
and
the
sayonara
guy
in
hindsight
it
should
have
be
a
very
easy
problem
to
solve
all
we
have
to
do
be
pick
the
right
people
and
get
on
with
it
but
that
s
not
what
we
do
because
we
couldn
t
agree
on
who
the
right
people
be
i
want
chris
others
want
paul
so
i
make
the
bad
decision
possible
no
decision
i
just
didn
t
have
the
time
to
gather
the
fact
and
figure
out
what
be
really
go
on
down
in
new
zealand
silicon
valley
be
in
the
middle
of
a
severe
recession
and
i
be
percent
consume
by
my
job
at
oracle
but
i
couldn
t
delay
forever
so
i
make
the
second
bad
decision
possible
i
delegate
the
decision
to
somebody
else
a
few
day
later
i
be
inform
that
as
a
result
of
chris
s
be
too
hard
on
the
crew
he
have
be
vote
off
the
team
i
be
told
that
chris
have
a
dark
side
well
i
d
never
see
this
dark
side
of
chris
s
personality
that
people
be
tell
me
about
all
i
saw
be
a
guy
who
push
himself
and
others
because
he
want
to
win
i
d
be
sail
with
chris
for
year
i
couldn
t
imagine
be
on
the
boat
without
him
he
s
incredibly
smart
organize
discipline
hardworking
and
intense
from
what
i
can
tell
he
s
the
best
sailor
in
the
world
how
can
we
fire
the
best
sailor
in
the
world
it
be
a
monumentally
stupid
mistake
when
i
finally
get
to
new
zealand
and
start
practice
with
the
sail
team
i
discover
that
the
guy
be
pretty
evenly
divide
between
the
pro
and
anti
chris
faction
several
of
the
people
i
have
sail
with
on
sayonara
told
me
that
they
be
absolutely
furious
about
how
badly
chris
have
be
treat
i
felt
terrible
how
could
i
have
let
this
happen
chris
be
my
friend
he
trust
me
how
could
i
let
him
down
like
that
some
of
the
key
guy
on
the
race
boat
didn
t
like
chris
and
didn
t
think
we
need
him
they
be
wrong
i
be
on
the
boat
for
all
the
race
of
the
first
round
robin
of
the
louis
vuitton
cup
it
be
painfully
obvious
that
we
be
lack
leadership
on
the
water
we
have
start
our
america
s
cup
campaign
with
three
top
rat
america
s
cup
driver
chris
dickson
paul
cayard
and
gavin
brady
but
somehow
we
manage
to
lose
all
three
of
them
we
lose
gavin
brady
early
on
because
he
thought
chris
and
paul
would
be
drive
our
two
boat
and
he
wouldn
t
get
a
chance
to
drive
at
all
as
it
turn
out
if
he
have
stayed
he
would
have
driven
our
race
boat
but
instead
he
go
to
prada
to
drive
their
warm
up
boat
that
meant
that
peter
holmberg
who
start
as
our
number
four
driver
be
now
our
number
one
driver
and
skipper
peter
be
ranked
number
one
in
the
world
in
small
boat
match
race
but
he
have
do
very
little
big
boat
race
and
he
have
virtually
no
america
s
cup
experience
as
the
cup
race
begin
and
the
pressure
built
the
team
start
make
mistake
we
hit
a
stretch
where
we
lose
four
out
of
five
race
what
make
it
possible
to
bring
dickson
back
be
that
lose
streak
although
oracle
bmw
s
skipper
peter
holmberg
have
prove
a
fiercely
competitive
starter
accord
to
ellison
he
be
prone
to
error
while
drive
the
rest
of
the
race
which
in
turn
be
put
pressure
on
lead
tactician
john
cutler
that
he
couldn
t
handle
the
result
be
that
twice
usa
lose
the
lead
and
the
race
against
clearly
weaker
opposition
after
lose
one
race
against
the
unimpressive
gbr
from
britain
ellison
told
me
that
rid
back
to
base
in
the
tender
he
have
be
closer
to
lose
his
temper
than
he
could
remember
for
a
very
long
time
demote
holmberg
and
restore
dickson
provoke
a
near
mutiny
with
four
crew
member
threaten
to
quit
although
only
one
stuart
argo
a
headsail
trimmer
actually
do
it
also
put
bill
erkelens
ellison
s
inexperienced
team
manager
in
an
awkward
position
have
have
his
earlier
judgment
so
comprehensively
overrule
ellison
be
unimpressed
this
time
i
didn
t
have
to
rely
on
someone
tell
me
what
be
go
on
i
be
on
the
boat
for
every
race
i
saw
firsthand
how
people
perform
under
pressure
i
have
all
the
fact
i
need
during
the
gbr
race
the
british
boat
jibed
and
our
tactician
john
cutler
say
gbr
jibe
do
we
go
with
him
you
can
t
do
that
it
s
too
slow
to
take
a
vote
after
the
other
boat
jibe
you
have
to
decide
in
advance
what
you
ll
do
if
they
jibe
the
tactical
situation
need
to
be
evaluate
in
advance
the
decision
have
to
be
make
in
advance
and
then
the
decision
have
to
be
clearly
communicate
to
everyone
in
the
crew
so
we
all
know
what
we
be
go
to
do
well
in
advance
of
actually
do
it
it
take
several
second
to
get
set
up
for
a
jibe
on
an
america
s
cup
boat
those
second
can
be
the
difference
between
win
and
lose
the
race
the
command
should
have
be
if
gbr
jibe
we
go
with
them
or
if
gbr
jibe
we
let
them
go
we
be
in
desperate
need
of
an
experienced
decisive
leader
so
i
ask
chris
to
come
back
i
held
a
team
meeting
to
announce
and
explain
my
decision
it
get
ugly
some
of
the
crew
complain
bitterly
say
they
didn
t
like
chris
and
they
didn
t
want
him
to
come
back
i
say
they
didn
t
have
to
like
him
i
wasn
t
ask
them
to
date
him
i
be
ask
them
to
sail
for
him
some
threaten
to
quit
they
say
they
vote
him
off
the
team
twice
interest
i
m
voting
him
back
on
the
team
they
say
chris
be
on
the
boat
put
too
much
pressure
on
the
crew
to
perform
what
if
the
crew
can
t
take
the
pressure
of
chris
be
on
our
boat
how
be
they
go
to
handle
the
pressure
of
race
against
russell
and
brad
on
the
swiss
boat
one
of
the
guy
say
i
thought
we
be
here
to
have
fun
do
you
think
lose
be
fun
i
don
t
this
be
professional
sport
not
high
school
we
re
here
for
one
and
only
one
reason
we
re
here
to
win
you
re
paid
to
win
but
we
re
not
win
so
you
ve
get
a
new
bos
i
say
it
as
clearly
as
i
could
chris
dickson
be
skipper
of
oracle
bmw
race
until
we
win
the
cup
or
we
re
beaten
on
the
water
by
the
end
of
the
meeting
i
have
achieve
two
thing
the
best
sailor
in
the
world
be
back
on
board
and
he
be
no
longer
the
most
hat
guy
on
our
sail
team
i
be
dickson
s
resurrection
have
another
consequence
after
drive
and
win
his
first
race
out
the
intensely
self
critical
new
zealander
have
conclude
that
he
couldn
t
make
up
for
the
month
of
practice
lose
while
kick
his
heel
on
land
he
also
knew
he
have
to
do
something
to
try
to
bind
the
feud
team
together
he
therefore
make
it
a
priority
to
persuade
holmberg
to
continue
to
start
the
boat
and
do
most
of
the
drive
while
he
make
the
tactical
call
but
that
meant
there
be
no
longer
room
for
ellison
on
board
no
team
could
afford
to
race
with
three
driver
it
be
a
tough
call
for
ellison
as
he
have
be
pleased
with
his
performance
against
the
world
s
best
professional
every
time
i
drove
we
increase
our
lead
over
the
other
boat
i
m
proud
of
that
but
at
the
same
time
i
know
i
wasn
t
make
the
difference
between
win
and
lose
because
i
be
only
drive
when
we
be
already
in
front
and
i
wasn
t
enjoy
myself
i
hadn
t
have
much
time
to
practice
with
the
team
and
i
hardly
knew
most
of
them
the
only
enjoyable
race
for
me
during
the
entire
louis
vuitton
cup
be
chris
s
first
day
back
on
the
race
boat
several
member
of
our
sail
team
go
on
strike
to
protest
chris
s
return
so
we
have
to
replace
them
with
a
bunch
of
our
old
sayonara
guy
it
be
great
to
be
with
the
guy
i
have
sail
with
for
year
it
be
just
like
the
old
day
except
we
be
in
usa
race
our
way
toward
the
america
s
cup
chris
easily
won
the
start
drove
for
a
while
and
then
i
take
over
it
be
a
clear
sunny
day
on
the
gulf
with
the
wind
out
of
the
northeast
at
fourteen
knot
we
lead
from
start
to
finish
that
be
my
last
turn
at
the
wheel
once
it
become
clear
to
everyone
that
chris
be
here
to
stay
and
we
d
race
with
or
without
the
strike
crew
member
the
strike
be
broken
all
but
one
of
the
sail
team
member
return
and
agree
to
sail
under
chris
s
leadership
their
return
meant
there
be
no
room
for
me
on
the
race
boat
be
on
the
boat
hadn
t
be
great
for
me
but
still
i
really
hat
get
off
he
also
knew
that
if
he
have
insist
on
stay
dickson
s
job
would
have
be
even
harder
than
it
be
already
the
same
people
who
didn
t
want
chris
on
the
boat
didn
t
want
me
there
either
the
transformation
of
the
team
s
performance
since
dickson
s
return
have
triumphantly
vindicate
ellison
s
decision
but
win
race
have
suppress
rather
than
end
the
grumble
and
the
personal
animosity
in
the
camp
the
chance
be
that
any
reversal
of
fortune
would
quickly
bring
them
bubbling
to
the
surface
again

the
first
schedule
semifinal
race
day
be
cancel
because
the
wind
be
average
about
twenty
four
knot
accord
to
the
rule
too
much
for
the
highly
tune
boat
to
sail
in
safely
the
follow
day
however
be
set
fair
although
the
wind
be
expect
to
get
up
later
this
should
suit
oracle
bmw
which
be
thought
to
have
an
advantage
in
strong
breeze
soon
after
a
m
the
team
begin
the
exodus
from
the
harbor
they
leave
in
pair
towed
by
the
powerful
launch
that
carry
spare
part
additional
sail
and
nonsailing
team
member
it
take
about
an
hour
and
a
half
to
reach
the
course
which
be
well
out
in
the
gulf
when
they
get
there
the
first
and
second
string
boat
from
each
of
the
four
team
still
in
the
regatta
will
sail
against
each
other
for
a
couple
of
hour
of
warmup
and
shakedown
soon
after
the
race
boat
set
off
the
rest
of
the
flotilla
bearing
official
and
spectator
start
stream
out
of
auckland
among
them
be
bertarelli
s
foot
vava
and
katana
to
get
closer
to
the
action
than
i
can
on
katana
i
decide
to
watch
the
race
from
one
of
the
oracle
bmw
chase
boat
forty
foot
rib
rigid
inflatable
boat
with
powerful
diesel
engine
the
previous
day
i
d
be
on
board
a
boat
crewed
by
a
couple
of
new
zealander
they
have
be
friendly
and
open
but
it
hadn
t
be
long
before
they
have
start
tell
me
about
how
fed
up
they
be
with
the
feud
in
the
camp
supporter
of
dickson
they
say
that
too
many
of
the
crew
on
the
race
boat
be
there
for
political
rather
than
sail
reason
the
atmospherics
aboard
the
boat
i
m
on
today
be
very
different
there
s
almost
no
banter
among
the
seven
or
eight
team
member
on
board
and
while
that
may
be
due
to
tension
i
get
the
distinct
impression
that
because
i
m
associate
with
ellison
i
m
not
a
welcome
presence
the
race
itself
go
badly
although
the
weather
condition
be
poor
it
s
overcast
and
squally
with
quite
heavy
sea
they
should
suit
usa
holmberg
be
drive
while
dickson
be
call
the
tactical
shot
but
despite
what
look
like
a
slight
advantage
at
the
start
line
it
quickly
becomes
clear
that
alinghi
have
found
more
breeze
by
go
out
to
the
right
hand
side
of
the
course
by
the
time
the
boat
reach
the
first
mark
sui
have
open
out
a
lead
of
nearly
fifteen
second
thereafter
coutts
and
butterworth
continue
to
stay
in
phase
with
the
wind
shift
finally
cross
the
line
more
than
a
minute
ahead
of
a
well
beaten
usa
on
the
chase
boat
there
s
no
display
of
emotion
the
truth
be
that
the
race
be
over
within
the
first
ten
minute
and
that
alinghi
have
give
oracle
bmw
a
lesson
in
match
sail
after
those
eleven
win
on
the
bounce
it
s
desperately
disappoint
but
ellison
doesn
t
seem
too
down
when
i
find
him
back
on
katana
they
won
the
right
side
get
the
first
shift
and
it
be
over
he
say
but
the
next
day
thing
don
t
go
any
well
although
holmberg
manages
to
get
to
the
far
right
of
the
course
where
the
wind
be
once
again
coutts
somehow
manages
not
only
to
stay
in
contention
but
to
get
to
the
first
weather
mark
a
little
ahead
it
s
enough
to
lock
oracle
bmw
out
for
the
rest
of
the
race
this
time
ellison
be
not
inclined
to
make
excuse
for
the
team
he
say
we
have
a
pretty
even
start
with
alinghi
so
it
become
a
drag
race
to
the
lay
line
when
both
boat
be
side
by
side
race
in
a
straight
line
like
that
you
have
to
drive
very
smoothly
inside
a
narrow
performance
envelope
of
wind
angle
and
boat
speed
it
s
a
combination
of
drive
by
feel
and
drive
by
the
instrument
most
of
peter
s
experience
be
in
small
boat
so
he
relies
more
on
what
he
feel
than
what
the
instrument
be
tell
him
i
don
t
think
you
can
beat
russell
coutts
in
a
drag
race
if
you
drive
that
way
consequently
ellison
decides
to
make
another
throw
of
the
dice
take
holmberg
off
the
boat
and
persuade
dickson
the
best
straight
line
driver
i
ve
ever
see
to
replace
him
at
the
helm
it
really
be
a
gamble
dickson
have
be
able
to
get
some
practice
in
since
he
come
back
on
the
water
but
not
enough
to
make
up
for
the
eight
month
spent
on
gardening
leave
but
that
s
not
the
only
problem
it
s
impossible
to
drive
and
plot
race
tactic
at
the
same
time
you
don
t
see
the
whole
picture
when
you
re
at
the
wheel
even
if
dickson
match
coutts
he
doesn
t
have
anyone
of
the
caliber
of
brad
butterworth
to
help
him
he
also
know
that
some
of
the
guy
on
the
boat
who
be
close
to
holmberg
may
even
be
hop
he
fails
i
ask
ellison
whether
for
the
sake
of
harmony
this
might
be
the
moment
to
sling
some
of
the
troublemaker
out
of
the
team
and
bring
some
of
the
talented
sailor
from
usa
on
board
the
race
boat
the
follow
day
ellison
do
decide
to
fire
a
couple
of
the
bad
agitator
from
the
shore
base
team
but
tempt
though
it
be
to
root
out
the
factionalism
he
think
it
s
too
late
to
make
wholesale
change
even
if
the
first
semi
final
go
to
alinghi
ellison
be
confident
that
oracle
can
reach
the
louis
vuitton
final
by
again
beating
oneworld
the
likely
winner
against
prada
with
some
speed
tweak
to
the
boat
he
still
think
there
s
a
chance
of
go
on
to
the
america
s
cup
itself
to
take
the
team
apart
and
reassemble
it
at
this
stage
might
be
emotionally
satisfy
but
it
s
not
the
way
to
maximize
our
chance
of
win
when
the
local
press
realizes
that
the
next
day
the
two
big
name
in
new

of

little
puff
of

out
on

at

over

on
the

with

suddenly

sui
it
s
a
crush
blow
emerge
from
his
cabin
a
downcast
ellison
say
the
problem
with
have
chris
on
the
wheel
be
that
it
mean
we
don
t
have
chris
as
tactician
nobody
can
do
both
job
at
once
he
drove
the
drag

brilliantly
and
beat
coutts
to
the
lay
line
we
have
the
race
won
until
we
make
that
tactical
blunder
although
alinghi
still
need
to

more
race
to
reach
the

realistically
the
chance
of

back
coutts

be

slim
and

the

have
decide
to
move
thing
around
again
holmberg
be
to
return
as
the
start
helmsman
but
will
immediately
hand
over
to
dickson
once
the
balletic
duel
of
the

give
way
to
the
race
proper
when
and
if
dickson
establishes
a
decent
fifty
to
seventy
five
meter
lead
the
plan
be
for

to
switch
place
again
allow

to
have
his
head
out
of
the

fully
focus
on

lose

error
down
to

ellison
say
that
whatever
happens
this
will
be
the
final
configuration
holmberg
he
say
have
be
very
professional
about
all
the
different
thing
we
try
but
ellison
know
that
compare
with
the
solidity
and
consistency
of
the
coutts
butterworth
partnership
they
be
make
it
up
as
they
go
along
the
next
day
the
race
be
close
but
alinghi
book
itself
into
the
louis
vuitton
final
with
another
impressively
error
free
performance
if
oracle

be
to
have
another
shot
at
the
swiss

will
have

in

second

unfortunately
for
me
before
the
race
start
again
i
have
to
leave
new
zealand
when
i
arrive
oracle
bmw
have
won
eleven
race
in
succession
but
while
i
ve
be
there
the
team
have
lose
four
in
a
row
inescapably
i
ve
come
to
identify
with
ellison
s
black
boat
and
it
s
bitterly
disappoint
i
feel
like
some
kind
of
jonah
before
i
head
back
to
london
i
ask
ellison
how
he
rate
his
chance
now
despite
alinghi
s
apparent
superiority
he
s
typically
optimistic
i
know
we
can
beat
them
we
have
several
engineering
change
schedule
that
should
speed
the
boat
up
before
we
have
to
race
them
again
we
ll
put
some
of
them
on
for
the
repechage
the
new
keel
bulb
we
use
this
week
actually
make
us
a
second
a
mile
slow
we
ll
replace
that
right
away
but
i
m
not
concerned
about
beating
oneworld
so
we
ll
hold
back
most
of
the
change
for
the
final
ellison
be
hopeful
because
he
think
that
sui
be
far
up
its
development
curve
than
be
the
newer
usa
and
for
most
of
america
s
cup
history
it
have
be
the
quicker
boat
rather
than
the
best
sail
team
that
have
usually
won
it
s
similar
to
formula
one
car
race
put
a
middle
driver
into
the
fast
car
and
nine
time
out
of
ten
he
ll
beat
the
fast
driver
in
a
middle
car

ellison
be
right
about
one
thing
once
again
oracle
bmw
turn
out
to
be
too
powerful
for
the
team
from
seattle
usa
claim
its
place
in
the
final
against
alinghi
with
a
walkover
conclude
inside
a
week
with
oneworld
safely
dispose
of
the
sail
team
will
have
a
short
break
over
christmas
while
major
change
be
make
to
the
boat
that
ellison
be
gamble
will
provide
an
edge
against
alinghi
he
have
more
or
less
concede
that
prevent
coutts
from
dominate
the
start
and
the
first
upwind
leg
be
unrealistic
but
to
even
the
score
the
plan
he
s
come
up
with
require
stand
america
s
cup
race
conventional
wisdom
on
its
head
the
first
boat
to
the
first
weather
mark
win
the
race
eighty
five
percent
of
the
time
that
s
why
most
america
s
cup
boat
have
an
upwind
design
bias
that
be
the
boat
trade
away
a
lot
of
downwind
speed
for
a
little
more
upwind
speed
but
to
take
advantage
of
your
upwind
speed
you
have
to
win
your
fair
share
of
the
start
so
you
can
get
onto
the
favor
side
of
the
racecourse
that
s
not
happen
for
us
russell
s
kill
us
in
the
start
so
alinghi
be
beating
us
to
the
first
weather
mark
almost
every
time
i
don
t
think
that
s
go
to
change
so
the
question
be
how
do
we
win
the
race
even
though
they
beat
us
to
the
first
weather
mark
ellison
have
decide
to
transform
the
boat
from
be
heavily
bias
for
sail
upwind
to
be
bias
for
sail
downwind
because
usa
be
very
narrow
the
theory
be
that
with
the
big
sail
area
the
mainsail
have
go
from
to
square
meter
that
s
allow
if
you
lighten
the
keel
bulb
it
should
be
a
downwind
flyer
make
it
possible
for
oracle
bmw
to
roll
past
alinghi
on
a
downwind
leg
and
then
sail
defensively
for
the
rest
of
the
race
what
make
ellison
hopeful
be
that
with
the
other
tweak
usa
appear
to
have
lose
very
little
of
its
upwind
pace
the
first
race
of
the
best
of
nine
series
go
alinghi
s
way
but
in
the
second
race
usa
s
speed
on
the
run
be
confirm
a
lead
of
twenty
six
second
at
the
first
mark
for
alinghi
be
cut
to
little
more
than
a
boat
s
length
by
the
leeward
mark
however
when
oracle
bmw
run
over
its
spinnaker
and
break
its
spinnaker
pole
the
chance
to
peg
alinghi
back
be
lose
if
that
s
frustrate
there
s
bad
to
come
in
the
third
race
although
sui
once
again
take
the
lead
on
the
second
downwind
leg
the
two
boat
engage
in
a
furious
duel
in
which
alinghi
could
have
be
penalize
but
in
fact
oracle
bmw
be
for
ram
its
rival
s
stern
scoop
although
the
american
boat
manages
to
stretch
out
a
twenty
eight
second
lead
at
the
final
weather
mark
in
the
end
it
s
not
quite
enough
to
unwind
the
penalty
a
mandatory
degree
turn
and
still
beat
sui
to
the
line
both
psychologically
and
practically
be
very
different
from
the
next
race
provide
conclusive
proof
that
if
only
ellison
s
team
can
avoid
mistake
beating
alinghi
be
possible
even
though
it
s
the
swiss
boat
that
again
take
the
early
lead
this
time
the
combination
of
a
good
weather
call
and
the
sheer
downwind
velocity
of
usa
prof
decisive
result
in
a
win
delta
of
more
than
two
minute
race
five
be
tantalizingly
close
the
two
boat
swap
the
lead
several
time
and
match
each
other
for
both
sail
skill
and
speed
through
the
water
unfortunately
for
ellison
it
s
the
nerve
of
coutts
and
butterworth
that
hold
the
steadier
to
deliver
a
fourth
win
but
by
a
little
more
than
a
boat
s
length
at
the
line
after
more
than
two
hour
of
the
most
intense
race
with
oracle
bmw
face
with
elimination
if
it
loses
the
next
race
it
s
not
surprising
that
the
heat
be
on
holmberg
to
gain
an
advantage
at
the
start
perhaps
he
s
try
too
hard
but
the
upshot
be
that
he
s
penalize
at
the
start
know
that
usa
will
have
to
complete
a
penalty
turn
at
some
point
in
the
race
allows
sui
to
sail
a
conservative
race
despite
oracle
bmw
s
take
the
lead
on
the
final
run
the
outcome
be
never
much
in
doubt
it
s
a
sad
end
to
the
campaign
but
the
margin
of
defeat
doesn
t
do
ellison
s
still
bickering
team
justice
two
time
america
s
cup
winner
peter
isler
conclude
it
be
a
close
series
look
at
the
number
of
lead
change
compare
with
other
round
that
s
an
indication
of
the
closeness
in
fact
there
be
eight
lead
change
in
the
last
four
race
include
two
in
the
last
half
mile
of
the
final
race
alone
however
isler
also
point
a
finger
at
where
he
thought
the
weakness
be
after
go
dickson
have
hand
the
helm
back
to
holmberg
but
they
have
never
manage
to
work
together
in
the
manner
of
coutts
and
butterworth
isler
who
use
to
navigate
for
the
legendary
dennis
connor
comment
dickson
call
the
shot
for
holmberg
create
a
micromanaging
afterguard
structure
that
maybe
wasn
t
a
good
way
to
play
it
in
a
match
race
the
helmsman
have
to
be
able
to
take
control
in
some
way
it
would
have
be
well
to
have
chris
drive
the
truth
be
that
there
be
no
ideal
way
for
holmberg
and
dickson
to
work
together
the
penalty
told
a
story
of
mistake
be
make
under
pressure
but
how
much
of
that
pressure
come
from
within
the
team
and
as
ellison
sum
it
up
in
an
e
mail
to
me
the
two
penalty
just
kill
us
without
the
penalty
the
score
would
have
be
to
and
the
race
would
have
continued
but
you
have
to
give
alinghi
credit
brad
and
russell
sail
brilliantly
we
give
them
a
lot
and
they
give
us
absolutely
nothing
in
return
it
be
a
brutal
experience
for
ellison
defeat
be
hard
to
take
on
many
count
it
be
bad
enough
realize
that
they
could
have
beaten
alinghi
a
sympathetic
e
mail
from
dennis
connor
provide
scant
comfort
i
be
sure
you
have
have
well
day
but
you
do
a
terrific
job
and
have
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
your
effort
i
thought
the
boat
be
very
good
and
the
guy
just
let
you
down
nothing
you
could
control
i
hope
you
enjoy
the
experience
and
will
continue
to
be
involve
all
the
best
warm
regard
dennis
unintentionally
connor
rubbed
salt
in
the
wound
when
he
e
mail
again
a
couple
of
day
later
i
thought
you
would
like
to
know
that
last
night
russell
say
your
boat
be
definitely
faster
in
the
last
three
race
my
feel
be
that
when
the
boat
sail
straight
for
any
length
of
time
you
be
quicker
but
may
have
suffer
in
the
tack
duel
cheer
dc
but
when
the
swiss
team
go
on
to
trounce
team
new
zealand
ellison
also
knew
just
how
close
he
have
come
to
the
great
prize
in
yacht
when
ask
if
he
would
make
another
attempt
to
win
the
cup
ellison
s
answer
be
absolutely
but
until
alinghi
s
triumph
against
the
holder
something
he
along
with
most
people
have
thought
highly
unlikely
because
of
team
new
zealand
s
innovation
packed
boat
ellison
be
far
from
certain
that
he
would
carry
on
he
told
me
yeah
i
say
absolutely
but
the
answer
that
kept
flash
through
my
mind
be
on
monday
i
start
tennis
lesson
tennis
be
much
less
expensive
than
america
s
cup
race
and
it
s
a
lot
more
fun
almost
needle
to
say
it
be
the
latter
that
matter
more
than
the
former
when
i
be
with
him
in
new
zealand
it
have
seem
as
though
he
hadn
t
be
get
much
fun
out
of
it
ellison
have
say
fun
fuck
no
it
wasn
t
fun
i
get
kick
off
my
own
boat
and
then
we
lose
all
i
want
to
do
be
come
down
here
and
drive
a
sailboat
what
i
end
up
do
be
run
a
screw
up
sail
team
it
wasn
t
fun
it
be
just
another
job
a
job
i
didn
t
want
i
didn
t
do
the
job
very
well
either
because
we
lose
yeah
i
know
we
come
in
second
big
deal
second
place
be
just
the
first
loser
to
mount
another
challenge
ellison
say
that
he
would
need
two
thing
a
united
team
compose
not
only
of
very
good
sailor
but
of
people
he
like
and
trust
and
a
radically
different
format
for
america
s
cup
race
the
whole
idea
of
practice
for
three
year
then
sail
for
three
month
be
idiotic
the
first
part
be
relatively
easy
this
time
we
ll
build
the
sail
team
around
chris
dickson
there
be
plenty
of
talented
guy
who
would
love
the
chance
to
sail
on
an
america
s
cup
boat
with
chris
practically
the
first
signing
ellison
intend
to
make
be
the
young
new
zealander
gavin
brady
who
sat
out
most
of
this
louis
vuitton
after
fall
out
with
his
prada
team
brady
have
a
reputation
for
be
a
tad
hotheaded
but
he
may
be
the
best
race
helmsman
in
new
zealand
he
reminds
dickson
a
little
of
himself
when
he
be
young
the
second
part
be
dependent
on
alinghi
s
win
the
america
s
cup
the
winner
in
concert
with
the
team
they
accept
as
challenger
of
record
usually
the
next
most
successful
competitor
have
a
huge
power
to
decide
the
rule
for
the
next
series
during
their
time
in
auckland
bertarelli
and
ellison
have
developed
a
mutual
like
and
respect
ellison
say
one
of
the
good
thing
that
s
come
out
of
all
this
be
that
ernesto
and
i
have
become
friend
it
be
a
historic
moment
in
sail
when
he
and
brad
and
russell
won
the
cup
and
take
it
to
europe
for
the
first
time
since
they
re
a
great
team
they
certainly
kick
our
butt
they
deserve
to
win
between
them
the
two
men
have
hit
upon
the
idea
of
turn
america
s
cup
race
into
something
much
more
like
the
formula
one
car
race
circus
with
alinghi
instal
as
holder
and
oracle
bmw
race
as
challenger
of
record
bertarelli
and
ellison
can
drive
through
the
rule
change
they
want
of
these
the
most
important
be
that
there
will
now
be
at
least
four
international
america
s
cup
class
regatta
a
year
they
will
be
held
in
different
part
of
the
world
and
will
count
as
qualify
round
for
the
next
louis
vuitton
cup
challenger
series
the
holder
will
also
race
and
some
race
will
be
specifically
for
owner
driver
it
mean
not
only
plenty
of
sail
for
the
like
of
bertarelli
and
ellison
but
a
much
more
attractive
and
consistent
package
for
television
and
sponsor
the
first
regatta
in
recognition
of
ellison
s
official
challenger
status
be
to
take
place
in
september
in
where
else
san
francisco
bay
this
time
naturally
ellison
be
quite
certain
that
his
oracle
bmw
team
will
beat
the
swiss
and
this
time
he
really
will
get
to
drive

i

just
how
formidable
when
he

boomerang
in
the
maxi
world
championship
in

i
thought
that

would
easily
defend
her
title
that
year
but
paul
have
other
idea
the
race
have
turn
out
to
be
very
close
and
the
championship
be
decide
on
the
very
last
race
on
the
very
last
day
of
the
regatta
if
boomerang
beat
us
in
that
race
it
would
take
the
title
the
start
be
critical
and
i
lose
it
boomerang
get
out
ahead
early
we
be
both
on
starboard
tack
with
sayonara
to
weather
a
couple
of
boat
length
behind
it
look
pretty
grim
but
very
gradually
i
be
able
to
creep
up
and
close
the
gap
meter
by
meter
until
sayonara
get
to
the
point
where
boomerang
couldn
t
tack
and
safely
cross
in
front
of
us
if
she
try
she
might
be
penalize
or
have
to
tack
on
our
lee
bow
to
avoid
us
she
didn
t
tack
so
from
that
point
on
it
become
a
drag
race
out
toward
the
port

line
we
get
there
first
tacked
in

and
lead
them
to
the

mark
we
round
the
buoy
more
than
three
boat
length
ahead

held
on
the
rest
of
the
way

boomerang
have
never
come
close
to
beating

to
me
there
be
three
street
rule
if
you
re
go
to
survive
in

first
of
all
don
t
screw
up
so
bad
you
knock
yourself
out
of
the
market
second
it
s
a
marathon
not
a
sprint
lastly
when
you
get
up
in
the
morning
you
well
be
run
this
be
like
the
world
championship
of
poker
every
year
you
ve
get
to
ante
up
more
and
more
just
to
stay
in
the
game
i
don
t
see
any
way
that
these
small
software
company
can
continue
the
level
of
investment
they
need
base
on
their
profitability
level
versus
the
profitability
and
asset
of
company
like
oracle
i
think
you
re
go
to
see
them
one
by
one
all
drop
by
the
wayside
we
re
all
in
the
middle
of
the

we
ll
see
who
get
out
the
other
side
it
be
similar
to
a
metaphor
coin
by
mark
jarvis
in
the
world
of

software
oracle
have
the
large
water
bottle
as
for

oracle
have
certainly
make
a
few
with
the
e
business
suite
but
none
have
be
bad
enough
to
take
it
out
of
the
race
a
race
make
longer
still
by
the
downturn
it
seem
to
me
this
be
ellison
s
single
big
mistake
despite
his
almost
matchless
experience
of
the
software
business
he
have
expect
success
for
the
e
business
suite
to
come
much
more
quickly
and
more
easily
than
it
could
ever
realistically
have
do
even
without
the
screwup
but
although
ellison
have
be
hopelessly
wrong
about
timing
and
crazily
overconfident
about
the
true
state
of
the
e
business
suite
in
the
month
immediately
after
its
launch
about
the
really
big
thing
he
d
be
vindicate
the
superiority
of
suite
over
best
of
breed
the
importance
of
reengineering
business
practice
to
fit
the
software
instead
of
rewrite
code
to
produce
customize
system
that
be
unreliable
and
impossible
to
upgrade
the
need
for
the
automation
of
whole
business
flow
to
be
complete
and
seamless
the
understand
that
the
key
to
get
useful
information
out
of
complex
computer
system
be
for
application
to
share
consistent
database
schema
but
despite
the
rightness
of
ellison
s
architectural
vision
there
be
still
many
doubter
in
april
ron
wohl
say
to
me
at
the
outset
people
say
that
it
be
impossible
for
the
e
business
suite
to
do
just
about
everything
then
they
say
maybe
it
be
possible
after
all
but
you
mess
up
the
execution
next
they
say
okay
it
work
but
it
s
not
for
us
how
do
we
persuade
people
finally
to
accept
the
superiority
of
the
e
business
suite
reference
and
proven
cost
reduction
if
you
save
time
and
dollar
nobody
can
debate
it
within
oracle
there
continued
to
be
worry
as
mark
jarvis
put
it
that
larry
be

much
the

purist
to
some

jeff

confuse
by
the

we

do
more
to
show
that
we
live
in
a
complicate
world
keith
block
have
a
slightly
different
perspective
he
say
ceo
like
the
architectural
sell
and
they
really
get
the
idea
of
the
single
data
model
but
the
truth
be
that
procurement
tends
to
be
driven
far
down
the
organization
if
a
cio
have
invest
million
in
an
sap
implementation
he
s
not
go
to
want
to
admit
that
he
s
make
a
mistake
although
oracle
have
take
major
step
nearly
two
year
earlier
to
ensure
that
integrate
the
e
business

with

be
perfectly
feasible
you
would
not
have
gotten
that
impression
from
the
firm
s
advertising
whereas
sap
be
forever
banging
the
drum
for
its
netweaver
integration
platform

talk
up
how
its
web

and

software
could
make
all
kind
of

work
together
without
the
pain
of

ellison
be
steadfastly
dismissive
of
that
approach
web

make
it
easy
for
one

to
another

even
if
the
application
be
run
on
different
computer
that
s
great
but
the
data
pass
by
one

have
to
be
structure
in
a
way
that
s
understandable
by
the

be
analogous
to
the

seem

it

all
or
nothing
it
be
a
real
dilemma
for
oracle
s
marketing
on
the
one
hand
ellison
didn
t
want
to
muddy
the
difference
between
what
he
believe
be
the
hopelessly
compromise
sap
philosophy
and
the
much
more
elegant
oracle
way
of
do
thing
on
the
other
mark
jarvis
have
a
point
in
say
oracle
need
to
bend
a
bit
with
the
market
we
have
all
the
interface
to
link
to
other
system
but
what
we
don
t
have
be
a
strong
integration
marketing
message
the
purity
of
ellison
s
vision
be
however
unambiguously
an
advantage
when
it
come
to
deliver
what
he
and
others
be
increasingly
call
the
utility
model
of
deliver
it
service
in
ellison
s
view
the
information
utility
be
something
much
more
than
a
fancy
new
name
for
the
old
style
outsource
of
data
center
management
practice
very
profitably
by
the
like
of
ibm
and
ed
if
the
utility
concept
meant
anything
it
have
to
deliver
a
quality
service
at
very
low
cost
and
with
complete
reliability
that
meant
use
only
software
that
be
preintegrated
and
design
to
work
out
of
the
box
on
certify

ellison
s
point
be
that
computer
system
didn
t
need
to
be
different
the
oracle
guarantee
in
which
oracle
promise
to
fulfill
all
a
firm
s

need
for
a

something
quite
revolutionary
in
an

that
have
train
its

to
write
blank

be
rapidly
win

and
not
just
in
the

as

expect
big

such
as
the
networking
giant
jds

be
go
down
that
road
and
even
the
federal

be
show
sign
of
interest
the
future
prospect
of
the

be
good
but
how
good
as
even
gartner
have
acknowledge
it
be
stable
mature
and
comprehensive
over
time
oracle
should
be
able
to
prove
that
architectural
purity
brings
with
it
a
host
of
real
world
benefit
the
promise
of
be
able
to
do
more
with

on

the

increasingly

its

the

also
be
a
proof
point
for
ellison

approach
the

it

as
with
almost
everything
to
do
with

one

to

invent
by

a
long
time
ago
since
neither

can
run
a
standard
application
like
sap
on
more
than
one
database

computer
their
only
approach
to

be
to
make
that

computer
as
big
as
possible
ibm
be
very
good
at
building

do
it

this

something
truly

copying
the

i
think
they
meant
to
break
into

lab
but
they
broke
into
the
ibm

by
mistake
and
from
oracle
s
point
of
view
linux
provide
something
else
for

its
nightmare
have
be
that
window
would
eventually
be
strong
enough
to
inflict
a
slow
death
on
unix
although
unix
would
continue
new

business
would
depend
on
run

on
top
of
the
operating

of
its
most
hat
and
dangerous
rival
while
linux
may
never
displace

every
chance
it

stymie

both

chuck

that
microsoft
have
no
good
argument
to
range
against
the
cost
and
flexibility
of
linux
and
what
s
more
it
be
try
to
argue
against
fashion
which
as
ellison
concedes
be
a
very
hard
thing
to
do

the
first

about
they
love
it
mark
jarvis
say
that
microsoft
have
no
idea
what
to
do

it
have
be
caught
up
in
a
form
of
asymmetric

another

work

so
will
linux

ellison
announce

there
be
widespread
skepticism
about
his
claim
for
it

now
it

that

ellison

but
he
have
be
force
to
admit
the
power
of
its
service
organization
i
want
us
to
imitate
the
one
brilliant
thing
ibm
have
do
over
the
last
decade
they
get
more
money
from
their
huge

we

we

we
need

grow
to
thousand
of

it
s
a
great
new
business
for
us
and
the
customer
save
a
lot
of

we
buy
the
computer
back
up
their

run
their

and
upgrade
their
software
much
more
cheaply
than
they
could
ever
do
it
themselves
it
be
simply
a
matter
of
finally
apply
specialization
of
labor
and
economy
of
scale
to
the
run
of
computer
system
in
other
word
the
information
utility
oracle
style
what
excite
ellison
be
his
conviction
that
the
utility
model
played
to
all
of
oracle
s
strength
although
ibm
be
spending
a
fortune
on
a
typically
well
craft
advertising
campaign
to
popularize
and
get
people
think
about
the
information
utility
ellison
argue
that
ibm
could
never
achieve
the
same
scale
economy
as
oracle
because
its
model
meant
never
building
exactly
the
same
data
center
twice
ibm
s
approach
to
outsource
be
highly
customize
on
a
customer
by
customer
basis
in
comparison
our
outsource
have
little
to
no
software
customization
we
have
a
true
low
cost
high
volume
utility
model
so
once
again
ibm
have
a
great
marketing
campaign
around
something
they
don
t
do
sap
would
also
be
at
a
disadvantage
its
software
be
less
flexible
than
oracle
s
it
be
present
in
only
one
part
of
the
stack
whereas
oracle
have
all
the
piece
and
compare
with
oracle
it
have
only
a
tiny
service
organization
both
oracle
and
sap
have
target
the
relatively
unpenetrated
midmarket
as
the
main
driver
of
application
sale
growth
in
come
year
but
ellison
be
now
convince
that
percent
of
that
market
would
opt
for
the
utility
approach
that
oracle
be
best
place
to
deliver
with
the
oracle
guarantee
oracle
would
provide
all
a
firm
s
compute
need
for
a
fix
price
keith
block
reckon
that
already
percent
of
new
application
business
be
base
around
the
software
as
service
model
and
what
be
ellison
s
answer
to
the
worried
cio
who
fear
be
put
out
of
a
job
cio
stand
for
chief
information
officer
cio
should
focus
on
provide
people
in
their
company
with
the
information
they
need
to
do
their
job
well
currently
cio
spend
most
of
their
time
evaluate
buying
and
assemble
cool
little
technology
component
into
expensive
computer
system
that
don

work
very
well
and
provide
precious
little
useful
information
to
the
people
run
the
business
so
do
ellison
believe
that
the
race
to
be
the
dominant
software
firm
of
the
twenty
first
century
be
still
oracle
s
to
lose
yes
we
ve
have
some
significant
screwup
but
we

still
manage

move
far
ahead
of

in
both

you

enough

to

model

payoff
in
other
word
victory
not
lose
but
postpone

one
consequence
of
stretch
time
horizon
be
that
ellison
s
idea
that
he
might
start
to
disengage
himself
little
by
little
devote
himself
to
biotech
research
be
very
definitely
on
ice
although
he
like
to
think
that
he
could
do
whatever
in
the
world
he
want
the
one
thing
he
knew
he
couldn
t
do
be
walk
away
from
oracle
until
the
last
battle
have
be
won
or
he
no
longer
have
anything
left
to
contribute
like
most
people
who
knew
the
company
and
the
man
i
found
it
almost
impossible
to
imagine
oracle
without
ellison
or
ellison
without
oracle
which
be
just
as
well
give
that
any
arrangement
for
an
orderly
succession
seem
to
be
as
far
in
the
future
as
ever
i
agree
with
ellison
that
the
strong
number
two
and
heir
apparent
whom
everyone
outside
oracle
appear
to
think
so
vital
be
irrelevant
ellison
be
also
right
in
say
that
there
be
no
shortage
of
management
talent
at
oracle
the
ten
or
twelve
most
senior
manager
who
make
the
place
work
would
have
have
far
less
opportunity
to
develop
if
a
strong
number
two
have
constantly
be
press
down
on
them
and
ellison
be
lucky
in
have
both
jeff
henley
and
safra
catz
to
complement
him
in
the
lead
outside
and
inside
role
at
oracle
catz
like
some
other
fiercely
intelligent
woman
i
have
know
and
quite
unlike
most
men
have
a
degree
of
loyalty
to
her
bos
that
transcend
any
personal
agenda
of
her
own
henley
be
a
straight
arrow
who
be
rich
enough
old
enough
and
wise
enough
to
tell
ellison
the
truth
when
he
need
to
hear
it
he
be
also
responsible
for
oracle
s
have
without
a
doubt
the
cleanest
book
in
the
high
technology
business
something
oracle
get
insufficient
credit
for
among
the
financial
analyst
community
he
and
ellison
be
among
the
first
corporate
executive
in
america
in
the
wake
of
the
enron
scandal
to
file
sworn
statement
with
the
security
and
exchange
commission
about
the
accuracy
of
their
company
account
ellison
be
very
specific
about
the
quality
his
dream
candidate
would
need
to
lead
oracle
after
him
that
person
must
be
an
engineering
manager
who
s
not
only
very
good
at
building
product
he
or
she
must
be
very
good
at
marketing
and
sell
the
product
as
well
but
first
and
foremost
the
person
must
be
a
good
engineer
at
its
core
oracle
be
a
software
engineering
company
and
we
need
to
be
run
by
a
software
engineer
what
would
be
less
important
in
the
future
be
visionary
leadership
ellison
continued
to
be
certain
that
there
would
be
no
more
major
platform
shift
in
software
that
you
either
call
right
or
die
it

there
aren
t

revolution
ahead
when
press
ellison
be
prepared
to
talk
about
only
two
of
his
manager
who
might
turn
out
to
have
the
necessary
quality
one
be
thomas
kurian
an
indian
in
his
mid
thirty
who
have
arrive
at
oracle
in
via
princeton
mckinsey
and
stanford
kurian
be
intense
and
serious
a
little
dour
even
although
ellison
assure
me
that
he
d
manage
to
make
him
laugh
at
least
once
but
kurian
in
only
a
few
year
have
achieve
something
remarkable
and
of
incalculable
strategic
importance
to
oracle
after
its
successive
failure
in
building
a
competitive
application
server
and
the
departure
of
those
who
have
be
responsible
kurian
have
make
oracle
accord
to
its
own
number
second
only
to
the
incumbent
bea
in
the

and
in
time
juicy

critical
to

s
ambition
to
be
the
dominant
enterprise
software
infrastructure
provider
commit
to
use
open
standard
kurian
have
create
a
strong
engineering
team
driven
it
with
a
combination
of
discipline
and
pragmatism
produce
a
quality
product
and
then
sell
it
with
passion
and
energy
to
the
outside
world
when
ellison
mention
kurian
he
can
t
help
beam
thomas
have
do
a
brilliant
job
absolutely
extraordinary
he
say
the
other
be
forty
three

old
john
wookey
although
wookey
have
join
oracle
only

much
of

the

push
the

toward

it
be
finally
due
to
make
its
debut
in
november
as
part
of
i
there
be
a
lot
rid
on
wookey
ellison
say
john
be
already
manage
all
our
medical
application
and
our
student
record
system
but
ron
thought
that
we
should
give
him
the
marketing
and
sale
automation
system
as
well
that
s
quite
a
load
but
john
jumped
right
in
and
the
progress
have
be
amaze
john
s
an
excellent
engineering
manager
and
leader
he
s
well
respect
throughout
the
company
if
either
kurian
or
wookey
turn
out
to
have
what
it
take
to
do
the
top
job
at
oracle
and
for
all
their
ability
i
m
not
sure
that
either
have
a
large
enough
personality
even
to
begin
to
fill
ellison
s
boot
the

well
be

more

as
ellison
put
it
to
me
i

a

about

in

begin
as
their

with
the

through
the

ellison
say
all
we
need
be
highly
intelligent
people
who
have
a
deep
understand
of
how
our

be
distant
history
as
ever
when
it
come
to

ellison
tends
to
oversimplification
the
truth
be
that
oracle
lose
a
lot
of
sale
talent
during
the
dot
com
boom
year
and
it
be
only
now

while
the

of
the
cowboy

and
their
scorch

to

have
go

still
need
more
of
the
kind
of

can
call
high
in

and

listen
to
with

one
reform
that
block
have
introduce
be
to
divide
the
sale
force
into
technology
and
application
specialist
the
spread
of
oracle
s
technology
offering
and
the
sweep
of
the
e

suite
make
it
impossible
for
anyone
to
sell
both
with
credibility
block
also
point
out
that
while
technology
require
what
he
call
a
transactional
culture
sell
on
feature
and
performance
application
require
a
consultative
culture
in
which
over
time
you
learn
to
match
your
product
against
a
customer
s
business
need
the
amaze
thing
be
that
it
have
take
oracle
so
long
to
work
this
out

and
what
of
larry
ellison
the
man
although
much
of
my
time
with
him
coincide
with
a
period
of
adversity
for
oracle
other
than
during
oracle
s
two
month
of
purgatory
in
sacramento
i
never
once
saw
ellison
downcast
his
unquenchable
optimism
and
almost
messianic
self
belief
never
falter
even
when
event
occasionally
conspire
to
make
a
fool
of
him
it
be
of
course
this
aspect
of
ellison
that
many
people
who
either
don
t
know
him
or
know
him
only
a
little
find
most
objectionable
for
them
he
be
at
best
a
bombastic
showman
at
bad
a
false
prophet
and
even
a
self
serve
liar
yet
i
be
more
convince
than
i
be
at
the
begin
of
my
journey
with
him
that
ellison
be
an
extraordinary
person
quite
different
from
and
infinitely
more
interest
than
the
caricature
beloved
of
the
medium
and
even
much
of
the
analyst
community
he
s
funny
and
entertain
but
also
highly
serious
always
interested
in
idea
and
eager
for
new
one
above
all
ellison
be
intense
even
when
he
s
meant
to
be
relax
on
one
of
his
huge
boat
there
s
a
restlessness
about
him
much
about
ellison
be
paradoxical
even
contradictory
he
s
enormously
vain
intellectually
dominate
and
irrepressibly
extrovert
but
he
s
also
shy
have
relatively
few
close
friend
and
be
in
constant
need
of
the
emotional
reassurance
that
for
much
of
his
life
have
be
lack
he
be
determinedly
youthful
but
he
be
never
far
from
thought
of
mortality
he
detests
vulgarity
and
yearns
for
simplicity
and
naturalness
but
he
also
derives
straightforward
pleasure
from
own
hugely
expensive
material
status
symbol
he
desperately
want
his
wealth
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
but
such
be
his
terror
of
be
found
a
hypocrite
that
he
recoil
at
the
very
idea
of
altruism
he
lavishes
praise
on
sometimes
overpromoted
subordinate
in
whom
he
place
huge
at
time
excessive
trust
but
he
act
with
ruthless
dispatch
toward
anyone
he
feel
have
let
him
down
professionally
he
combine
great
sensitivity
and
empathy
to
the
feeling
of
those
around
him
with
a
capacity
for
sometimes
childlike
selfishness
he
be
ultraconfrontational
in
business
but
he
go
to
almost
any
length
to
avoid
confrontation
at
a
personal
level
he
either
delegate
to
the
point
of
detachment
or
be
obsessively
control
down
to
the
last
detail
he
pride
himself
on
never
lose
his
temper
but
he
be
manifestly
driven
by
overwhelm
passion
ellison
be
nothing
if
not
complicate
about
one
thing
however
ellison
be
relentlessly
consistent
he
see
life
as
a
constant
series
of
test
through
which
he
can
discover
his
limit
and
when
it
fails
to
throw
up
enough
of
them
he
go
look
for
more
