many
way
that
may
even
be
almost
the
precise
midpoint
in
a
nine

the

it
i
d
like
to
tell
you
that
story
and
a
couple
of
other
one
besides


the
year
dawn
bright
with
promise
for
dell
inc
apart
from
the
blip
of
the
dot

five
year
earlier
a
correction
that
affected
not
just
us
but
tech
company
across
the
board
dell
have
enjoy
a
pretty
uninterrupted
run
of
growth
in
revenue
and
profit
and
cash
flow
for
two
decade
in
january
our
share
of
pc
sell
stood
at
a
robust
percent
in
february
fortune
name
us
the
most
admire
company
in
america
dell
they
write
be
thrive
in
an
industry
that
may
technically
qualify
as
be
in
the
poorest
state
in
the
union
its
profit
in
this
margin
squeeze
business
soar
percent
in
a
feat
that
dell
make
look
boringly
routine
and
now
it
s
the
first
pc
maker
to
hold
the
rank
of
america
s
most
admire
since
the
original
pc
maker
ibm
log
off
in
by
september
though
thing
have
begin
to
change
a
lot
though
our
profit
rise
percent
in
the
second
quarter
total
revenue
be
several
hundred
million
dollar
short
of
projection
we
be
the
new
york
time
report
wrestling
with
the
same
question
face
other
mature
technology
company
that
ranked
among
the
high
flier
of
the
s
how
to
increase
revenue
when
it
be
already
so
big
compound
the
problem
be
the
fact
that
personal
computer
and
laptop
which
account
for
roughly
percent
of
our
sale
be
no
longer
the
rich
profit
center
they
use
to
be
as
price
have
drop
over
the
course
of
the
year
we
d
have
to
sell
that
many
more
pc
just
to
keep
up
with
the
previous
year
s
revenue
interviewed
by
the
time
our
ceo
kevin
rollins
blame
himself
for
the
shortfall
frankly
he
say
we
execute
poorly
on
manage
overall
sell
price
especially
on
machine
sell
to
consumer
yes
you
read
that
correctly
it
wasn
t
a
typographical
error
kevin
rollins
not
i
be
ceo
of
dell
inc
that
fall
i
d
step
aside
from
the
position
in
july
and
kevin
have
take
over
though
take
over
isn
t
exactly
the
right
way
to
put
it
i
remain
chairman
and
the
two
of
us
continued
to
run
the
company
together
as
we
have
for
a
decade
not
much
really
change
except
for
our
title
and
so
if
there
be
blame
to
be
laid
for
that
revenue
loss
i
share
it
but
it
quickly
become
apparent
in
late
that
the
underperformance
wasn
t
an
anomaly
dell
be
begin
to
hit
serious
headwind
for
one
thing
our
competitor
be
get
smarter
company
like
hewlett
packard
acer
and
lenovo
company
we
d
always
soundly
defeat
with
our
build
to
order
model
have
go
back
into
their
cave
and
figure
out
how
to
duplicate
many
of
our
supply
chain
innovation
meanwhile
build
to

itself
so
effective
at
address
the
many
combination
and
permutation
of

its

as
the
industry
shift
from

to
less

customer

start
to
focus
more
on
service
and

transition
from
the
fundamental
client
product
the
pc
and
related
peripheral
to
software
server
and
the
data
center
it
take
us
a
little
bit
longer
than
we
would
have
like
to
figure
all
this
out
and
then
there
be
a
dell
plus
that
be
subtly
turn
into
a
minus
for
a
few
year
we
d
be
prioritize
profit
over
growth
and
share
and
a
company
s
success
be
always
a
balance
between
those
three
our
profit
be
strong
in
the
s
but
now
our
share
be
erode
and
that
can
be
a
slippery
slope
we
need
to
build
new
capability
we
need
to
invest
in
new
area
and
we
need
to
move
fast
in
i
return
as
ceo
both
a
symbolic
move
and
a
practical
one
and
we
embark
upon
a
major
merger
and
acquisition
initiative
start
with
the
purchase
of
the
data
storage
company
equallogic
for
billion
the
financial
crisis
of
threw
a
temporary
wrench
into
our
plan
but
the
follow
year
we
restart
the
program
by
buying
perot
system
for
billion
and
in
we
really
go
on
a
roll
acquire
storage
system
management
cloud
and
software
company
such
as
compellent
boomi
exanet
insite
one
kace
ocarina
network
and
scalent
in
to
round
out
our
enterprise
capability
we
bought
secureworks
rna
network
and
force
network
and
in
we
make
still
more
key
acquisition
in
software
and
security
include
quest
software
sonicwall
and
credant
technology
for
fiscal
year
dell
achieve
its
high
ever
revenue
earnings
operating
income
cash
flow
and
earnings
per
share
maybe
it
be
the
calm
before
the
storm
but
in
the
meantime
all
be
not
well
at
dell
we
d
try
to
enter
the
smartphone
and
tablet
market
without
success
we
d
even
come
up
with
what
be
know
at
the
time
as
a
phablet
a
five
inch
android
device
call
the
streak
it
didn
t
exactly
streak
lightning
across
the
sky
for
one
thing
most
of
the
profit
go
to
google
by
our
pc
sale
have
fall
by
double
digit
and
our
share
have
continued
to
erode
by
year
end
with
the
heavy
weight
of
window
s
failure
drag
us
down
it
have
drop
to
percent
and
now
profit
be
decline
as
well
our
market
capitalization
have
fall
below
billion
in
late
our
share
price
would
sink
almost
to
penny
stock
territory
less
than
a
plummet
from
the
to
level
it
have
see
in
through
the
conventional
wisdom
shout
through
a
thousand
megaphone
on
the
internet
as
well
as
on
cnbc
and
other
medium
outlet
be
that
the
pc
be
doom
and
that
therefore
dell
be
pretty
much
doom
too
our
shareholder
be
not
happy
myself
include
despite
our
spectacular
success
over
the
year
anyone
who
d
bought
dell
share
back
at
the
begin
and
held
on
to
them
have
earn
percent
on
their
investment
twenty
seven
time
great
than
the
percent
return
on
the
s
p
during
the
same
period
our
stockholder
be
worried
about
the
company
s
future
still
i
have
the
full
support
of
our
shareholder
who
in
july
reelect
me
to
serve
as
ceo
and
chairman
of
dell
with
over
percent
of
the
vote
and
i
be
try
to
reassure
them
we
re
really
not
a
pc
company
anymore
i
told
fortune
editor
in
chief
andy
serwer
in
july
at
fortune
s
brainstorm
tech
conference
in
aspen
but
andy
be
a
tough
sell
be
it
really
the
case
that
you
re
not
a
pc
company
now
or
that
you
don
t
want
to
be
a
pc
company
in
the
future
he
ask
me
i
remind
him
that
in
the
last
five
year
we
d
make
a
concert
shift
in
our
business
toward
end
to
end
it
solution
a
complete
set
of
capability
for
customer
from
their
data
center
to
their
client
system
to
security
software
system
management
storage
server
and
networking
i
told
andy
that
dell
be
really
in
four
business
now
first
come
the
client
business
which
be
itself
transform
with
all
that
be
go
on
in
mobility
and
client
virtualization
which
in
turn
brought
new
need
in
term
of
security
next
come
the
enterprise
data
center
i
remind
andy
that
we
d
built
a
tremendous
business
in
storage
and
networking
fuel
by
all
those
acquisition
about
twenty
five
in
the
last
three
or
four
year
i
say
that
in
case
anyone
have
forgotten
about
one
third
of
the
server
in
north
america
be
make
by
dell
cloud
and
virtual
infrastructure
have
become
very
big
for
us
then
there
be
our
software
business
center
around
system
management
and
it
security
i
say
we
be
see
around
twenty
nine
billion
security
event
per
day
we
be
protect
ten
of
trillion
of
dollar
of
asset
for
the
big
bank
and
financial
service
firm
in
the
world
i
call
andy
s
attention
to
the
fact
that
of
the
people
at
dell
almost
half
a
full
be
in
our
fourth
business
service
help
company
capture
value
from
all
the
it
need
out
there
so
we
re
right
in
the
middle
of
some
of
the
stickiest
challenge
out
there
i
told
andy
how
do
you
connect
old
application
to
cloud
application
how
do
you
secure
and
modernize
it
environment
and
bring
them
off
mainframe
and
onto
the
x
platform
put
them
in
the
dell
cloud
and
do
it
more
efficiently
dell
i
say
proudly
be
a
much
different
company
than
it
have
be
four
or
five
year
ago
andy
look
a
little
bemuse
be
i
wrong
or
do
i
not
hear
you
mention
pc
at
all
in
that
little
soliloquy
he
ask
even
smart
people
it
seem
be
hung
up
on
that
one
subject
andy
then
put
a
polling
question
up
on
the
screen
behind
us
last
year
desktop
and
laptop
account
for
percent
of
dell
s
revenue
down
from
percent
in
how
big
will
dell
s
pc
business
be
in
five
year
possible
answer
be
a
percent
about
same
as
today
b
percent
and
c
percent
or
less
choice
c
get
the
most
vote
by
far
the
correct
answer
be
a
i
told
andy
that
with
all
due
respect
to
his
poll
a
well
way
to
think
about
the
question
of
our
pc
business
vi
vi
our
other
business
be
in
term
of
revenue
and
profit
let
s
say
i
say
you
sell
a
billion
dollar
worth
of
pc
versus
a
billion
dollar
worth
of
software
those
two
transaction
would
have
very
different
characteristic
in
term
of
free
cash
flow
and
margin
therein
lay
some
of
the
difficulty
in
look
at
dell
strictly
from
a
revenue
standpoint
our
business
mix
be
definitely
shift
i
repeat
hop
the
message
be
start
to
sink
in
i
believe
passionately
in
everything
i
told
andy
at
aspen
and
in
the
day
week
and
month
that
follow
the
business
press
kept
push
the
narrative
that
dell
equal
pc
and
the
pc
be
die
and
our
stock
continued
to
swoon
i
ll
freely
admit
that
some
part
of
me
smart
at
see
our
share
price
sink
so
low
the
company
have
my
name
on
it
after
my
family
it
meant
everything
to
me
but
my
wiser
side
saw
an
opportunity
for
the
company
back
in
i
bought
a
big
block
of
dell
stock
in
the
open
market
confident
that
the
share
price
would
rise
there
be
very
stringent
rule
about
when
and
how
an
insider
like
me
can
buy
or
sell
our
stock
soon
but
not
too
soon
after
quarterly
earnings
have
be
announce
needle
to
say
i
follow
them
yet
it
also
occur
to
me
that
if
i
with
help
from
others
of
course
could
buy
back
all
the
stock
our
transformation
as
a
company
could
proceed
without
the
tyranny
the
ever
tick
shot
clock
of
a
quarterly
earnings
report
go
private
would
open
up
the
possibility
of
dramatically
accelerate
the
growth
of
the
company
and
allow
us
to
have
a
far
great
impact
in
the
world
others
have
the
same
thought
in
at
a
sanford
bernstein
conference
an
analyst
name
toni
sacconaghi
have
ask
me
if
i
d
consider
take
the
company
private
yes
i
say
my
monosyllable
hung
in
the
air
there
be
a
little
laughter
in
the
room
sacconaghi
smile
that
s
more
succinct
than
i
would
think
he
say
what
would
be
a
galvanize
event
for
you
to
consider
it
much
more
seriously
no
comment
i
say
feel
i
may
have
already
say
too
much
i

number
and
projection
southeastern
s
chief
investment

t
the
idea

the
fact
that
our
second
large
stockholder

it
up
i
have
no
clue
what
cates
be
drive
at
obviously
he
want
to
increase
the
value
of
his
share
but
be
he
say
that
he
want
me
to
buy
him
out
or
be
he

me
take
the
company

d
like
to
share
so
i
ask
and
cates

me
a
simple
spreadsheet
that
outline
his
idea

the
spreadsheet
to

and
brian
sent
it
to
a
banker
he
knew
at

together
on
august
at
a
beach
caf
near
my
house
on
the
big
island
of
hawaii
i
have
no
idea
why
durban
want
to
meet
maybe
silver
lake
want
to
buy
one
of
our
business
or
sell
us
one
of
their
business
maybe
they
want
me
to
invest
in
a
new
fund
of
theirs
could
ve
be
any
of
a
half
dozen
different
thing
august
be
a
friday
a
beautiful
day
in
hawaii
okay
it
s
always
a
beautiful
day
in
hawaii
but
i
be
especially
happy
to
be
there
just
then
i
like
to
joke
that
august
in
my
hometown
of
austin
texas
be
like
the
fm
band
on
the
radio
it
go
from
to
that
morning
on
the
big
island
a
cool
breeze
be
blowing
off
the
ocean
the
temperature
be
a
perfect
degree
durban
and
i
could
have
sat
down
and
talk
at
the
caf
but
why
would
you
want
to
sit
inside
on
a
day
like
that
let
s
go
for
a
walk
i
say
i
do
some
of
my
best
think
while
i
m
walk
and
the
surroundings
didn
t
hurt
a
bit
there
be
a
trail
there
that
ran
along
the
coast
down
across
the
beach
the
surf
crashed
pale
blue
green
and
clear
as
glass
what
s
up
i
ask
durban
as
we
set
out
we
ve
look
at
your
company
and
we
think
you
should
consider
go
private
he
told
me
huh
i
say
as
if
this
be
the
first
time
the
idea
have
ever
occur
to
me
in
truth
i
d
thought
about
it
many
time
before
especially
as
the
worldwide
saving
glut
that
follow
the
dot
com
bust
brought
plunge
interest
rate
always
a
plus
when
you
re
borrowing
money
for
acquisition
and
we
think
we
may
be
able
to
help
you
he
say
tell
me
more
my
expression
say
i
be
act
naive
because
if
he
have
a
plan
i
want
him
to
spell
it
out
huh
i
say
again
really
really
he
say
okay
i
say
tell
me
why
you
think
that
s
a
good
idea


we
walk
and
talk
for
the
next
hour
it
be
a
kind
of
socratic
back
and
forth
me
ask
a
lot
of
question
about
how
this
idea
would
work
and
what
could
go
wrong
egon
respond
clearly
and
candidly
examine
every
possibility
thoroughly
i
like
him
at
once
he
struck
me
as
very
smart
aggressive
and
bold
he
knew
why
he
want
to
talk
to
me
he
have
a
pretty
strong
belief
in
the
idea
yet
he
wasn
t
try
to
sell
me
anything
he
wasn
t
say
we
silver
lake
be
ready
to
commit
to
this
deal
they
have
a
hypothesis
durban
and
i
be
there
to
explore
it
the
first
thing
he
say
be
that
base
on
the
talk
i
d
give
at
the
fortune
brainstorm
conference
as
well
as
research
his
firm
have
do
use
only
public
information
silver
lake
be
acutely
aware
of
dell
s
transformation
strategy
they
understood
why
we
d
be
acquire
all
those
company
durban
say
that
he
and
his
partner
didn
t
believe
for
a
minute
that
the
pc
be
doom
they
felt
personal
computer
and
peripheral
could
continue
to
be
an
important
part
of
our
revenue
stream
even
as
we
extend
the
business
in
new
direction
and
they
believe
in
those
new
direction
as
such
egon
say
we
feel
dell
be
significantly
undervalue
i
agree
i
say
i
could
ve
say
a
lot
more
the
fact
be
that
in
a
way
give
all
we
d
be
do
to
reinvent
the
company
for
the
past
five
year
and
all
we
d
be
say
about
it
i
felt
abandon
by
the
public
shareholder
but
that
be
an
emotional
reaction
so
for
the
time
be
i
kept
it
to
myself
and
then
durban
continued
there
be
the
fact
that
dell
have
a
lot
of
cash
on
its
balance
sheet
i
be
well
aware
of
this
of
course
and
well
aware
of
its
drawback
on
the
plus
side
it
s
not
a
popular
idea
for
tech
company
to
have
a
lot
of
debt
have
a
net
position
with
a
lot
of
cash
be
see
as
the
right
thing
to
do
and
that
s
where
we
be
but
from
a
capital
structure
finance
perspective
if
your
company
have
a
lot
of
cash
its
equity
can
t
appreciate
nearly
as
much
because
in
a
sense
it
s
weigh
down
by
the
cash
cash
doesn
t
appreciate
if
on
the
other
hand
you
use
the
cash
to
buy
back
stock
the
stock
can
appreciate
far
more
now
do
that
insert
risk
stock
price
can
always
fall
for
all
kind
of
unanticipated
reason
but
if
you
have
a
business
that
generates
lot
of
cash
flow
very
consistently
a
stock
buyback
could
turn
out
to
be
a
very
good
thing
and
a
buyout
durban
say
could
turn
out
to
be
a
very
very
good
thing
especially
with
dell
s
stock
at
those
historic
low
and
as
a
cherry
on
the
sundae
interest
rate
happen
to
be
very
low
then
dell
s
earn
strength
would
make
bank
eager
to
lend
to
us
and
suddenly
durban
be
talk
about
us
and
the
low
interest
rate
would
make
the
borrowing
painless
yet
if
we
be
talk
about
buying
back
all
of
dell
s
stock
we
be
talk
about
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
neighborhood
of
billion
still
egon
say
he
felt
sure
that
between
silver
lake
and
me
and
perhaps
a
couple
of
other
interested
party
we
could
easily
raise
all
the
capital
we
d
need
and
could
easily
borrow
the
rest
a
leveraged
buyout
would
be
preferable
because
all
party
would
be
out
that
much
less
cash
and
give
the
proven
profitability
of
dell
would
be
able
to
pay
down
the
debt
quickly
i
ask
him
what
he
thought
the
debt
equity
split
would
likely
be
he
give
me
a
rough
idea
and
then
something
occur
to
me
gee
i
say
this
be
a
large
transaction
have
you
guy
ever
do
anything
this
big
they
hadn
t
durban
say
but
they
be
completely
confident
about
raise
their
game
i
be
intrigue
at
this
approach
from
a
major
private
equity
firm
i
knew
that
if
there
be
to
be
a
go
private
it
wouldn
t
be
initiate
by
investment
banker
it
would
be
initiate
by
a
firm
like
silver
lake
and
somebody
like
egon
durban
investment
banker
be
essentially
matchmaker
private
equity
firm
like
blackstone
apollo
tpg
kkr
and
silver
lake
invest
their
own
money
durban
be
talk
about
put
up
silver
lake
s
own
capital
and
a
great
deal
of
it
and
he
want
to
do
it
because
he
thought
his
firm
would
reap
a
substantial
return
that
be
capitalism
at
its
purest
everything
durban
be
say
make
sense
to
me
i
like
him
and
i
like
silver
lake
and
i
knew
in
my
gut
that
it
be
time
to
make
a
big
move
but
an
enormous
amount
be
at
stake
far
too
much
to
do
or
say
anything
abrupt
far
too
much
not
to
investigate
all
possible
avenue
go
private
be
the
ultimate
consider
decision
nor
do
i
think
that
egon
would
ve
expect
me
to
react
impulsively
and
so
when
i
told
him
i
d
think
about
what
he
say
and
get
back
to
him
he
told
me
he
completely
understood
we
shook
hand
and
each
go
off
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
beautiful
day


i
have
another
neighbor
in
hawaii
one
whose
house
i
could
see
from
mine
george
robert
the
r
in
kkr
kohlberg
kravis
robert
the
global
investment
firm
george
and
his
co
ceo
henry
kravis
be
first
cousin
who
d
grown
up
together
and
they
be
kind
of
the
elder
statesman
of
the
private
equity
business
they
d
more
or
less
create
the
modern
day
private
equity
firm
and
they
d
be
two
of
the
pioneer
of
the
leveraged
buyout
they
be
central
to
the
rjr
nabisco
takeover
story
that
turn
into
the
book
and
movie
barbarian
at
the
gate
i
go
over
to
see
george
and
i
take
my
laptop
with
me
i
flip
the
computer
open
and
show
him
some
fact
and
figure
about
dell
all
publicly
available
information
no
forecast
or
proprietary
data
base
on
this
do
you
think
it
s
possible
that
we
could
go
private
i
ask
george
look
over
the
data
then
ask
a
few
question
yeah
i
think
it
s
very
possible
he
say
in
fact
we
d
like
to
help
you
do
it
well
that
s
interest
i
thought
so
now
i
ve
get
two
lead
private
equity
people
who
have
told
me
that
this
be
not
just
possible
but
very
possible
and
these
be
just
my
neighbor
in
hawaii
i
haven
t
even
reach
out
to
anybody
else
haven
t
talk
to
steve
schwarzman
at
blackstone
or
david
rubinstein
at
carlyle
or
david
bonderman
at
tpg
but
the
person
i
need
to
talk
to
first
i
immediately
realize
be
larry
tu
i
flew
back
to
austin
on
august
and
met
with
larry
who
told
me
with
a
serious
expression
that
if
i
be
about
to
embark
on
the
process
of
try
to
take
the
company
private
several
thing
need
to
happen
first
i
would
have
to
retain
my
own
counsel
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
principle
the
company
could
not
represent
me
in
an
endeavor
that
could
change
the
very
essence
of
dell
as
a
corporation
an
endeavor
that
dell
s
board
or
stockholder
or
both
might
or
might
not
approve
and
second
of
course
i
would
have
to
tell
the
board
about
what
i
propose
to
do
right
away
as
to
the
first
i
call
marty
lipton
the
found
partner
of
the
law
firm
wachtell
lipton
rosen
katz
and
one
of
the
world
s
expert
on
complex
corporate
transaction
what
do
i
do
i
ask
the
first
thing
you
need
to
do
marty
say
be
talk
to
your
board
yup
get
that
i
say
and
the
next
thing
be
that
you
need
to
do
absolutely
everything
precisely
by
the
book
he
say
i
m
put
you
in
touch
with
steve
rosenblum
here
at
the
firm
he
know
this
process
inside
and
out
next
i
phone
alex
mandl
the
chairman
of
the
dutch
digital
security
giant
gemalto
and
lead
independent
director
on
dell
s
board
and
told
him
about
my
idea
i
described
staley
cates
s
june
proposal
and
my
meeting
with
durban
and
robert
i
say
that
i
be
still
in
the
exploratory
stage
that
i
hadn
t
yet
decide
whether
i
want
to
proceed
but
that
if
i
do
i
d
be
willing
to
partner
with
any
party
that
offer
the
best
possible
deal
for
the
stockholder
i
told
alex
that
i
d
need
access
to
certain
proprietary
company
information
in
order
to
explore
the
feasibility
of
take
dell
private
alex
say
he
d
have
to
ask
the
board
about
all
of
it
thing
be
start
to
move
fast
it
would
ve
be
impractical
to
gather
all
twelve
member
of
the
board
include
me
people
run
big
company
spread
all
over
the
world
for
an
in
person
meeting
in
anything
resemble
short
order
so
on
august
the
board
held
a
meeting
by
phone
and
i
have
by
now
be
thoroughly
prepped
by
steve
rosenblum
told
the
member
all
that
i
d
told
alex
and
more
that
the
fundamental
reason
for
my
desire
to
explore
a
proposal
to
acquire
the
company
be
that
i
believe
dell
could
be
well
manage
as
a
private
company
without
public
company
pressure
for
short
term
performance
and
the
other
disadvantage
of
be
public
change
and
evolve
a
business
transform
it
be
an
uncertain
process
one
that
involves
financial
volatility
and
public
investor
don
t
like
uncertainty
or
volatility
that
i
d
have
separate
preliminary
conversation
with
george
robert
of
kkr
and
egon
durban
of
silver
lake
base
exclusively
on
public
information
i
say
each
of
them
be
of
the
belief
that
it
might
be
feasible
to
develop
an
offer
that
would
be
attractive
to
the
company
and
its
shareholder
that
also
in
a
conversation
i
d
have
some
week
ago
with
staley
cates
of
southeastern
asset
management
seam
he
indicate
that
seam
might
be
interested
in
join
with
me
in
explore
a
proposal
to
acquire
the
company
that
i
have
make
no
agreement
or
arrangement
with
silver
lake
kkr
or
southeastern
that
i
d
spoken
to
them
separately
not
together
and
that
no
confidential
information
have
be
provide
that
i
hadn
t
hire
an
investment
banker
and
would
advise
the
board
before
do
so
that
i
d
ask
wachtell
lipton
rosen
katz
to
act
as
my
personal
counsel
in
this
matter
that
i
would
not
proceed
without
the
board
s
full
knowledge
and
its
approval
of
my
have
far
discussion
and
use
of
company
information
to
explore
the
possibility
of
make
a
proposal
that
i
knew
any
transaction
must
be
at
a
fair
price
and
the
high
price
reasonably
obtainable
for
the
shareholder
and
that
that
price
would
ultimately
be
subject
to
a
market
check
that
i
recognize
that
any
proposal
from
me
would
be
review
and
negotiate
by
and
be
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
independent
director
or
a
special
committee
of
independent
director
that
any
process
would
be
determine
by
the
independent
director
or
the
special
committee
and
that
the
independent
director
or
the
special
committee
would
retain
independent
counsel
and
an
independent
banker
that
the
next
step
would
be
with
the
board
s
permission
for
me
to
work
with
adviser
and
potential
partner
to
explore
make
a
proposal
to
the
board
that
larry
tu
would
advise
the
board
on
confidentiality
trading
and
other
legal
matter
i
say
that
i
wouldn
t
go
any
far
in
my
discussion
with
any
outside
party
unless
the
independent
director
approve
my
do
so
alex
say
the
board
need
to
talk
about
all
this
and
they
need
to
do
it
with
me
not
present
i
get
off
the
conference
call
mandl
call
me
after
the
meeting
and
told
me
that
the
board
be
prepared
to
consider
the
possibility
of
a
go
private
or
the
possibility
of
any
strategic
alternative
that
could
extricate
dell
from
its
predicament
and
to
that
end
that
they
approve
my
have
discussion
about
a
possible
go
private
proposal
i
call
egon
durban
and
george
robert
and
told
them
separately
neither
have
a
clue
that
i
have
spoken
with
the
other
i
do
not
call
staley
cates
there
be
very
specific
rule
about
thing
that
investor
and
owner
of
company
can
and
cannot
do
if
one
major
investor
in
a
company
go
into
a
room
by
him
or
herself
and
say
hmm
maybe
we
ll
take
this
company
private
well
that
person
be
just
talk
to
him
or
herself
but
if
i
as
the
large
dell
shareholder
and
seam
as
the
second
large
shareholder
be
meeting
and
talk
about
this
we
could
be
view
as
form
a
group
that
would
require
an
sec
filing
and
that
filing
would
be
public
information
and
news
of
the
potential
deal
would
be
in
the
public
domain
and
typically
if
these
thing
go
public
before
they
re
sign
and
announce
they
have
a
small
chance
of
actually
occur
neither
silver
lake
nor
kkr
by
definition
as
private
equity
firm
own
share
in
dell
inc
a
publicly
held
company
we
we
at
that
point
be
just
me
and
my
legal
team
at
wachtell
lipton
agree
that
if
we
reach
the
point
of
signing
and
announce
a
go
private
transaction
we
would
try
to
contact
southeastern
then
to
see
if
they
be
still
interested
on
august

without

august
our
number
for
the
second
quarter
of
fiscal
year
come
out
our
fiscal
year
end
on
the
last
day
of
january
so
most
of
fiscal
year
occur
in
calendar
year
the
number
be
not
great
dell
s
revenue
for
the
second
quarter
be
billion
approximately
million
less
than
we
d
project
in
early
july
and
approximately
million
less
than
we
d
project
in
early
june
we
therefore
lower
our
fiscal
year
earnings
per
share
guidance
a
fancy
term
for
prediction
from
to
we
attribute
the
lower
outlook
to
the
uncertain
economic
environment
competitive
dynamic
with
other
company
and
the
decline
in
demand
in
the
euc
business
that
s
end
user
compute
as
in
desktop
laptop
display
and
other
peripheral
you
can
guess
how
our
stock
price
react
interestingly
we
have
our
regular
quarterly
meeting
with
southeastern
asset
management
the
day
after
the
earnings
report
and
staley
cates
make
absolutely
no
mention
of
the
go
private
idea
i
puzzle
about
that
one
for
a
while
meanwhile
both
the
board
and
the
special
committee
begin
have
close
door
meeting
lot
of
them
and
close
door
meant
two
thing
one
the
public
include
dell
shareholder
have
no
idea
they
be
go
on
and
two
the
door
be
close
to
me
no
admission
to
the
founder
and
ceo
there
might
as
well
have
be
a
sign
on
the
boardroom
door
reading
michael
keep
out
i
knew
all
these
meeting
be
happen
but
i
didn
t
know
when
or
what
be
happen
in
them
i
just
kept
wonder
what
the
heck
be
go
on
and
why
everything
be
take
so
long
here
i
have
two
major
private
equity
firm
eager
to
do
this
deal
with
me
i
be
certain
others
would
be
eager
too
how
complicate
could
it
be

different
place
thing
be
simpler
back
at
the
begin
weren
t
they
maybe
it
always
seem
that
way
in
retrospect
but
the
truth
be
that
way
back
in
the
fall
of
my
fledgling
computer
company
almost
end
before
it
begin
almost
die
right
there
in
my
freshman
dorm
room
dobie
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
or
to
be
exact
in
a
hotel
room
at
the
hyatt
regency
austin
but
i
m
get
ahead
of
myself
first

little
background
i
m
a
proud
texan

be
ambitious
people
they
d
relocate
from

not
only
diverse
and
welcome
but

with
opportunity
he
d

out
how

big
part
of
the
building
so
they
be

other

after
that

successful
orthodontist

by
outworking

be
always
calculate

one
of
my

victor
add
machine
my
father
have
the
kind
with
the

when

the
column
of
number
it
print
on

when

in
third
grade
i
get
a
national
semiconductor
electronic
calculator
a
big
step
up
from
the
victor
i
be
fascinate
by
the
complicate
problem
this
little
machine
could
handle
by
seventh
grade
i
be
in
an
advanced
math
class

good
enough
at

keyboard
but
the
other

and
i
discover
that
you
could
type
mathematical
equation

very
basic
program
on
this
terminal
send
them
off
to
a
mainframe

i

you
mind
you
i
be
twelve
year
old
my
clothes
would
carry
home
pungent
odor
from
my
restaurant
job
sometimes
my
mom
would
make
me
strip
off
my
outer
garment
in
the
driveway
so
she
could
hose
me
off
before
i
be
allow
to
enter
the
house
i
also
get
a
job
at
a
coin
and
jewelry
store
negotiate
price
on
gold
coin
that
people
bought
and
sell
the
owner
would
give
me
a
cut
of
each
transaction
and
i
didn
t
just
collect
stamp
i
sell
them
at
the
stamp
auction
i
attend
often
as
a
kid
attend
often
until
i
realize
that
the
auctioneer
be
take
a
percentage
of
the
proceeds
why
not
i
thought
eliminate
the
middleman
i
talk
some
of
my
friend
into
give
me
their
stamp
on
consignment
then
on
a
typewriter
i
one
finger
typed
a
twelve
page
catalogue
listing
their
stamp
and
mine
then
i
bought
an
ad
in
linn
s
stamp
news
advertising
dell
s
stamp
and
mail
off
xeroxed
catalogue
to
everyone
that
respond
sell
a
bunch
of
stamp
make
pretty
good
money
so
i
be
sit
on
some
fund
and
all
the
while
beg
and
plead
and
cajole
until
my
parent
finally
give
in
for
my
fourteenth
birthday
i
be
allow
to
take
almost
thirteen
hundred
dollar
of
my
hard
earn
saving
out
of
the
bank
and
order
an
apple
ii
i
be
beside
myself
with
excitement
wait
for
it
to
arrive
day
felt
like
week
then
one
day
i
get
a
call
from
ups
say
the
computer
have
arrive
but
for
some
reason
it
be
held
up
at
the
local
warehouse
delivery
would
take
a
while
longer
nobody
be
say
how
long
that
be
unacceptable
i
make
my
father
drive
me
over
there
to
pick
it
up
when
we
get
back
home
the
car
have
barely
stop
move
in
our
driveway
when
i
jumped
out
carry
the
precious
cargo
carefully
take
it
to
my
bedroom
unboxed
the
beautiful
computer
it
even
smell
beautiful
and
immediately
take
it
apart
to
see
how
it
work
my
parent
be
horrify
and
furious
but
i
thought
but
didn
t
say
how
could
you
understand
it
if
you
didn
t
take
it
apart
assemble
or
disassemble
the
apple
ii
be
a
beautiful
thing
and
one
of
the
beautiful
thing
about
it
be
its
open
architecture
every
circuit
be
on
its
own
unique
chip
so
you
could
go
in
and
start
to
play
with
these
circuit
and
modify
them
you
could
reprogram
the
bios
the
basic
input
output
system
the
program
embed
on
a
chip
on
the
motherboard
that
control
all
the
other
device
inside
the
computer
and
upgrade
it
this
be
amaze
i
thought
i
can
program
my
own
computer
there
be
more
back
before
the
internet
before
compuserve
or
prodigy
or
aol
there
use
to
be
something
call
the
computerize
bulletin
board
system
cbbs
use
a
hayes
modem
a
brand
new
invention
at
the
time
you
could
dial
in
and
communicate
with
people
all
around
the
country
learn
and
socialize
and
play
game
that
seem
super
intrigue
to
me
so
i
bought
a
modem
and
set
up
a
bulletin
board
of
my
own
but
of
course
it
wouldn
t
do
if
my
mom
or
dad
picked
up
the
phone
and
heard
modem
tone
instead
of
a
dial
tone
so
it
make
perfect
sense
to
me
to
call
southwestern
bell
and
ask
them
to
come
and
install
another
phone
line
in
the
house
luckily
for
me
my
parent
be
more
amuse
than
angry
word
get
around
that
i
knew
a
thing
or
two
about
computer
i
soon
begin
tutor
kid
in
the
neighborhood
on
how
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
apple
ii
that
become
a
pretty
lucrative
sideline
i
also
join
haaug
the
houston
area
apple
user
group
hundred
of
techie
get
together
once
or
twice
a
month
at
a
local
library
to
talk
upgrade
and
trade
part
and
swap
story
i
would
hang
out
with
these
guy
they
be
almost
all
guy
and
get
all
kind
of
idea
about
how
to
modify
my
apple
ii
haaug
also
sent
out
a
dot
matrix
print
monthly
newsletter
contain
important
information
like
the
follow
one
of
the
least
expensive
and
thus
surprisingly
underpublicized
accessory
for
the
apple
ii
be
the
programmer
s
aid
the
pa
be
a
single
k
byte
rom
chip
which
plug
into
socket
d
of
your
apple
it
contains
a
library
of
routine
which
integer
basic
user
frequently
need
but
don
t
always
have
easy
access
to
i
be
totally
into
all
of
it
at
the
group
meeting
i
met
a
computer
engineer
in
his
twenty
or
thirty
a
really
smart
technical
guy
i
thought
ok
i
m
go
to
hang
around
this
guy
and
see
what
i
can
learn
and
together
we
come
up
with
something
pretty
cool
at
the
time
developer
be
write
software
for
the
apple
ii
and
the
problem
be
that
they
d
sell
one
copy
of
the
software
then
everybody
would
copy
it
and
the
developer
would
never
make
any
money
all
you
need
be
two
floppy
disk
drive
you
d
put
the
software
in
one
and
a
blank
disk
in
the
other
then
type
in
a
copy
command
educator
be
some
of
the
bad
offender
they
felt
like
well
we
re
educator
so
we
shouldn
t
really
have
to
pay
for
software
so
my
engineer
buddy
and
i
invent
a
copy
protect
method
every
floppy
disk
have
a
certain
number
of
track
i
believe
it
be
thirty
five
we
figure
out
a
way
of
program
the
software
so
that
it
would
write
some
data
on
a
half
track
in
between
the
track
when
you
ran
the
copy
program
it
would
copy
the
data
that
be
on
the
track
but
not
the
half
track
result
no
copy
we
go
and
sell
this
to
a
bunch
of
company
that
be
write
education
software
it
become
a
little
business
for
a
while
and
we
do
all
right
then
i
read
that
steve
job
be
come
to
houston
to
speak
to
our
user
group
it
be
the
spring
of
job
fascinate
me
not
just
as
a
computer
pioneer
but
as
an
entrepreneur
i
d
read
about
him
in
the
business
magazine
with
the
same
intense
admiration
that
drew
me
to
the
story
of
fred
smith
and
charles
schwab
ted
turner
and
william
mcgowan
like
those
men
job
have
start
with
little
but
an
idea
and
an
intense
drive
to
bring
that
idea
to
fruition
and
like
them
he
be
succeed
in
change
american
business
job
be
just
twenty
five
and
the
company
he
d
found
with
wozniak
seem
poise
to
go
into
orbit
in
on
the
cusp
of
its
initial
public
offering
and
the
introduction
of
the
apple
iii
which
promise
to
be
to
the
apple
ii
what
the
apple
ii
have
be
to
the
apple
i
and
job
in
person
be
even
more
compelling
than
he
be
in
print
when
he
enter
the
room
at
our
meeting
it
be
as
though
the
water
part
he
spoke
with
passion
about
how
the
personal
computer
his
personal
computer
be
revolutionize
the
world
he
spoke
in
soar
metaphor
it
s
now
possible
for
the
capital
investment
of
a
passenger
train
to
buy
one
thousand
volkswagens
he
say
the
difference
be
that
those
thousand
people
have
the
freedom
to
go
where
when
how
and
with
whom
they
want
to
go
with
personal
computer
he
be
say
with
his
personal
computer
people
would
have
the
capacity
to
accomplish
the
unimaginable
i
be
fifteen
and
rivet
i
couldn
t
have
begin
to
imagine
that
in
five
year
job
and
i
would
be
not
only
colleague
but
friend


my
family
s
move
from
grape
street
to
a
fancier
house
in
the
memorial
neighborhood
coincide
with
the
begin
of
my
first
year
in
high
school
as
you
might
imagine
an
upscale
school
district
would
have
a
really
nice
high
school
and
memorial
high
school
didn
t
disappoint
it
even
have
a
computer
lab
highly
unusual
at
the
time
naturally
i
take
a
computer
class
mr
haynes
be
the
teacher
mr
haynes
be
teach
us
about
program
a
subject
about
which
i
already
knew
quite
a
bit
and
at
that
point
in
my
adolescence
i
wasn
t
shy
about
show
off
my
knowledge
the
truth
be
i
be
a
bit
of
a
smart
as
one
day
mr
haynes
told
the
class
with
some
excitement
that
he
be
go
to
write
a
program
to
create
a
sine
wave
use
basic
program
language
and
that
we
could
all
watch
him
and
learn
well
that
wasn
t
news
to
me
i
d
already
learn
how
to
program
in
machine
language
which
be
like
talk
directly
to
the
microprocessor
and
be
a
pretty
complicate
process
it
be
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
i
can
t
do
it
anymore
and
i
be
proud
that
i
have
master
it
and
so
the
moment
after
mr
haynes
told
the
class
of
his
plan
i
spoke
right
up
there
be
a
much
well
way
than
basic
program
language
to
create
a
sine
wave
i
say
you
could
do
it
in
machine
language
i
say
and
it
would
be
much
faster
mr
haynes
shot
me
a
dirty
look
okay
he
say
why
don
t
you
write
it
in
machine
language
and
i
ll
write
it
in
basic
and
we
ll
come
back
next
tuesday
and
we
ll
see
whose
be
faster
we
come
back
the
next
tuesday
and
he
ran
his
program
dit
dit
dit
dit
dit
dit
dit
dit
dit
dit
dit
dit
sine
wave
then
i
ran
mine
vroop
sine
wave
from
that
day
forward
mr
haynes
hat
me
and
i
m
sorry
to
say
that
i
didn
t
mind

there
as
wire
magazine
later
write
big
blue
s
entry
into
the
personal
computer
market
would
effectively
sweep
away
the
competition
and
effectively
have
the
field
to
itself
for
a
while
mark
those
last
three
word
ibm

sixty
five
thousand

and
with
all
due
respect
to
the
rivet
steve
job
one
of
those
sale
be
to
me
on
august
i
become
an
instant
ibm
convert
the
personal
computer
as
business
machine
business
machine
after
all
be
two
third
of
ibm
s
name
be
i
believe
the
wave
of
the
future
as
soon
as
i
take
my
apart
which
of
course
i
do
immediately
i
discover
a
couple
of
strike
thing
first
of
all
as
with
the
apple
ii
the
s
architecture
be
open
you
could
literally
understand
what
every
chip
be
do
the
other
thing
i
found
when
i
disassemble
the
ibm
pc
be
that
there
be
nothing
inside
from
ibm
it
be
all
part
from
other
company
there
be
that
cpu
from
intel
and
every
chip
be
marked
with
the
name
of
its
manufacturer
i
could
just
walk
into
radioshack
or
another
local
electronics
store
and
buy
the
chip
i
need
and
the
pc
s
operating
system
m
do
be
developed
not
by
ibm
but
by
that
scrappy
little
outfit
microsoft
there
be
just
one
exception
to
this
odd
make
by
others
theme
only
one
thing
that
be
unique
to
this
machine
the
basic
input
output
system
the
bios
but
all
that
outsource
be
very
strange
i
thought
it
would
later
become
apparent
that
ibm
have
create
the
pc
quickly
and
with
off
the
shelf
component
out
of
expediency
because
they
be
secretly
worried
about
apple
s
inroad
into
the
consumer
and
education
market
so
instead
of
create
their
own
operating
system
which
they
certainly
knew
how
to
do
and
create
their
own
microprocessor
which
they
certainly
knew
how
to
do
they
chose
do
from
microsoft
and
the
intel
they
be
such
a
huge
and
powerful
company
such
an
american
institution
so
completely
synonymous
with
the
word
computer
that
i
don
t
think
they
thought
anyone
would
ever
challenge
them


the
summer
between
my
sophomore
and
junior
year
at
memorial
high
be
an
eventful
one
and
not
just
because
of
the
pc
for
one
thing
i
now
have
my
driver
s
license
which
expand
my
horizon
dramatically
i
be
use
to
rid
my
bicycle
all
over
houston
to
go
to
stamp
store
or
my
various
job
or
apple
user
group
meeting
sometimes
i
d
pedal
twenty
or
thirty
mile
clear
across
to
the
other
side
of
town
but
that
get
tire
and
sometimes
it
rain
now
i
could
really
go
place
my
father
let
me
use
the
old
family
station
wagon
a
massive
light
blue
oldsmobile
cutlas
if
you
hit
anything
you
ll
probably
be
okay
my
dad
say
this
thing
be
a
tank
drive
also
expand
my
economic
opportunity
dramatically
that
summer
i
get
a
new
job
along
with
hundred
of
other
teenager
i
sell
subscription
to
the
now
defunct
houston
post
call
random
people
on
the
phone
and
try
to
talk
them
into
get
the
paper
be
naturally
ambitious
i
want
to
sell
as
many
subscription
as
possible
and
almost
immediately
i
observe
three
thing
first
that
if
you
sound
like
the
people
you
be
try
to
sell
a
subscription
to
they
be
much
more
likely
to
buy
from
you
i
would
talk
to
my
prospect
with
a
heavy
texas
accent
strike
up
a
conversation
result
often
follow
the
second
thing
i
notice
be
that
people
who
be
move
into
a
new
residence
be
more
likely
to
subscribe
to
the
paper
and
the
third
thing
i
observe
kind
of
a
corollary
of
the
second
be
that
people
who
be
get
married
be
much
more
likely
to
buy
a
subscription
maybe
out
of
some
kind
of
excitement
at
settle
down
and
begin
grown
up
life
the
begin
of
a
plan
occur
to
me
in
texas
when
you
want
to
get
a
marriage
license
you
have
to
go
to
the
county
courthouse
to
apply
give
the
address
you
want
the
license
sent
to
and
i
figure
out
that
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
foia
i
as
a
fellow
texas
citizen
be
entitle
to
go
to
any
county
courthouse
in
the
state
and
say
i
want
to
see
all
the
marriage
license
application
you
receive
during
the
past
year
i
clearly
remember
the
first
time
i
do
it
at
the
harris
county
courthouse
downtown
houston
the
guy
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
look
at
me
like
oh
my
god
then
he
say
be
you
sure
then
he
disappear
for
what
felt
like
an
hour
and
come
back
carry
these
huge
book
and
i
thought
jackpot
in
one
stroke
i
have
go
from
the
hit
or
miss
of
cold
call
to
discover
a
gold
mine
of
people
who
be
way
more
likely
than
not
to
subscribe
to
the
paper
at
first
i
have
to
sit
there
and
write
down
every
name
and
address
but
then
i
realize
i
could
bring
in
my
trusty
apple
ii
it
be
much
lighter
than
the
ibm
pc
plug
it
in
and
type
in
all
the
info
and
then
it
hit
me
that
there
be
sixteen
county
surround
houston
they
all
have
courthouse
and
every
courthouse
have
record
of
marriage
application
jackpot
time
sixteen
i
have
wheel
i
have
a
computer
and
i
have
friend
so
i
hire
my
high
school
buddy
to
travel
to
all
those
courthouse
and
get
all
that
info
some
of
them
have
their
own
apple
ii
that
they
could
take
along
to
get
everything
down
or
sometimes
they
borrow
mine
and
then
i
conduct
a
massive
direct
mail
campaign
send
subscription
offer
to
every
young
married
couple
on
that
huge
list
part
of
the
building
boom
in
houston
be
that
all
these
very
large
apartment
and
condominium
complex
be
go
up

little
form
between

young
married
and

a
little
over

pretty
good
reason
from
my
first
day
in
her
class

routine
be
the
same
i
would
come
in

room
sit
down

practically
the
moment
i
open
up
my
new
ibm

and
look
inside
i
thought
how

to
my
steady
intake
of
byte
and
pc

have
plenty
of
idea

really
want
to
max
the
thing
out
internal
modem
be
a
brand
new
thing
i
have
to
install
a
modem
and
the
pc
didn
t
come
with
a
hard
drive

have
to
put
in

hard
drive
and
plenty
of
extra
memory
the
new
ibm
user
group
i
join
give
me
even
more
idea
the
apple
group
have
be
techy
and
wonky
but
all
kind
of
under
the
flag
of
that
apple
spirit
of
artsy
rebellion
arcade
game
and
fantasy
game
wizard
and
warlock
stuff
be
a
big
part
of
the
agenda
the
ibm
group
be
a
whole
different
deal
its
member
be
engineer
and
scientist
and
businesspeople
and
all
people
want
to
talk
about
be
how
can
we
use
this
thing
for
business
i
be
fascinate
by
how
empower
a
tool
the
pc
be
until
very
recently
people
have
be
use
slide
rule
and
calculator
and
pencil
to
figure
thing
out
and
suddenly
there
be
spreadsheet
and
word
processor
suddenly
an
individual
could
calculate
enormous
amount
of
data
really
quickly
it
wasn
t
just
the
province
of
the
data
processing
department
i
even
found
a
new
computer
friend
his
name
be
john
hart
and
he
work
as
an
engineer
in
shell
oil
s
it
department
a
super
nice
guy
forty

d
go
visit
him
at
his
office
or
go
over
to
his
house
and
we
d
talk
about
nothing
but
computer
how
could
we
make
our
pc
more
powerful
how
could
we
use
this
program
or
that
software
for
business
everything
we
be
look
at
and
think
about
be

i
could
do
the
same
thing
for

result
he
paid
for
the
part
and

nice
fee
for
my
time
and
since
the
whole

very
cost

to
buy
an
ibm

need
and
sell
it
to
him
at
a
reasonable
markup

of
byte

and
so
be
i
then

again
and
again
suddenly
i
be
in
business


i
be
get
tire
of
drive
that
big
boat
of
an
oldsmobile
around
so
at
the
start
of
my
senior
year
at
memorial
i
go
with
my
parent
to
a
bmw
dealership
in
downtown
houston
and
picked
out
a
brand
new
white
manual
transmission
i
a
beautiful
machine
an
adolescent
s
dream
of
a
car
when
it
come
time
to
pay
the
salesman
naturally
look
to
my
mom
and
dad
assume
that
these
well
off
parent
be
indulge
their
spoil
son
and
then
i
get
to
enjoy
the
shock
on
the
guy
s
face
when
i
take
out
a
cashier
s
check
for
most
of
the
plus
and
a
wad
of
cash
for
the
rest
i
d
actually
brought
my
parent
along
for
backup
know
that
a
seventeen
year
old
kid
might
not
be
trust
to
have
that
kind
of
money
i
have
it
and
then
some
thanks
to
my
newspaper
subscription
fund
and
my
new
custom
computer
business
be
it
a
little
strange
to
take
my
mom
and
dad
with
me
when
i
bought
my
bmw
it
didn
t
feel
strange
to
me
i
be
close
to
my
parent
then
again

seventeen
year
old

the
mixed
feeling
that
kind
of
closeness
carry
i
love
my
mom
and
dad
deeply
but
to
say
they
be
involve
in
my
life
be
to
put
it
mildly
steven
be
off
at
college

straggler
third
son
just
twelve
at
the
time
seem
to
be
operating
in
a
state
of
anarchy
so
i
have
become
my
parent
focus
and
there
be
a
lot
of
focus
by
the
time
i
be
a
junior
in
high
school
i
begin
to
rebel
between
computer
user
group
and
computer
friend
not
to
mention
all
my
various
job
i
have
a
lot
go
on
and
my
mom
and
dad
be
always
bugging
me
about
what
i
be
do
and
who
i
be
do
it
with
and
where
i
be
go
to
the
last
question
i
have
a
stock
answer
different
place
the
truth
be
as
much
as
i
love
my
parent
and
as
cozy
as
living
at
home
be
i
couldn
t
wait
to
get
the
heck
out
of
there
i
d
receive
my
acceptance
letter
from
the
only
college
i
d
apply
to
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
and
my
life
be
pretty
much
plan
out
for
me
i
would
go
and
take
premed
course
and
become
a
doctor
didn
t
matter
what
kind
as
long
as
i
could
hang
out
a
shingle
and
mom
and
dad
could
say
oh
michael
he
s
practice
internal
medicine
or
whatever
i
be
go
with
the
program
on
autopilot
meanwhile
there
be
this
other
thing
computer
that
i
be
passionately
excite
about
and
that
i
couldn
t
really
tell
my
parent
about
because
it
be
so
far
from
what
they
have
in
mind
i
be
to
graduate
from
memorial
high
in
may
but
that
march
i
drove
off
to
austin
to
rent
an
apartment
with
my
own
money
a
life
raft
an
oasis
of
freedom
a
hundred
and
fifty
beautiful
mile
from
home
in
the
back
seat
of
my
bmw
be
three
soup
up
ibm
pc
and
in
the
trunk
there
be
two
more

go
private
in
private
ceo
a
big
important
sound
title
founder
and
ceo
even
more
so
right
sort
of
the
truth
be
that
ceo
of
public
company
and
even
founder
ceo
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
their
stockholder
and
board
of
director
the
board
have
duty
to
the
shareholder
the
ceo
report
to
the
board
the
board
set
the
ceo
s
salary
oversees
his
or
her
activity
the
board
have
the
power
to
fire
him
or
her
there
have
be
numerous
example
of
chief
executive
officer
run
afoul
of
their
shareholder
and
be
remove
by
their
board
now
and
then
it
s
even
happen
to
big
important
company
founder
we
don
t
have
to
look
any
far
than
steve
job
get
kick
to
the
curb
by
apple
in
so
in
set
out
on
my
quest
to
take
dell
private
i
be
under
no
illusion
i
didn
t
feel
invulnerable
or
all
powerful
i
never
thought
for
a
minute
that
i
be
operating
on
my
own
or
with
impunity
i
be
answerable
to
our
board
and
once
the
news
of
my
effort
go
public
the
stockholder
would
weigh
in
too
the
board
have
give
me
permission
to
begin
discussion
with
private
equity
firm
i
also
need
to
find
out
which
bank
or
bank
could
help
finance
the
deal
and
urgently
i
need
to
keep
all
these
discussion
as
confidential
as
possible
typically
when
big
deal
leak
before
they
re
announce
and
this
be
go
to
be
an
extremely
big
deal
those
deal
have
a
much
small
chance
of
actually
occur
when
a
big
deal
leak
there
s
suddenly
a
story
out
there
that
may
or
may
not
be
accurate
and
there
s
little
you
meaning
me
can
do
about
it
you
pretty
much
have
to
say
no
comment
you
ve
lose
control
of
the
narrative
you
don
t
have
a
deal
yet
you
don
t
know
if
you
re
go
to
have
one
and
anything
you
can
say
be
likely
to
be
misconstrue
jeopardizing
the
possibility
of
a
deal
when
you
do
officially
announce
you
deploy
a
vast
array
of
communication
to
investor
team
member
customer
you
can
explain
the
deal
you
can
reassure
everyone
who
s
affected
and
this
mean
many
many
people
that
their
interest
be
go
to
be
enhance
by
the
deal
you
can
give
everybody
comfort
about
what
s
about
to
happen
when
there
s
a
leak
you
can
t
do
any
of
that
a
leak
creates
worry
and
turmoil
and
potential
morale
issue
among
the
team
there
s
a
real
risk
of
lose
people
who
get
worried
about
what
their
place
be
go
to
be
and
there
s
a
real
risk
of
lose
customer
to
competitor
who
stir
up
fud
fear
uncertainty
and
doubt
about
your
company
when
you
take
a
company
private
you
re
basically
put
it
up
for
sale
i
want
need
to
be
the
one
who
wound
up
buying
dell
together
with
one
or
more
private
equity
firm
whoever
would
offer
the
high
price
to
our
shareholder
but
in
put
the
company
up
for
sale
it
wasn
t
outside
the
realm
of
possibility
that
someone
might
try
to
grab
my
company
away
my
company
it
be
a
paradox
i
couldn
t
really
say
dell
be
mine
because
it
be
a
public
company
i
own
less
than
percent
of
the
outstanding
share
but
i
d
start
it
so
i
couldn
t
help
think
of
it
as
my
company
i
felt
you
might
say
a
certain
affiliation
with
it


on
september
the
special
committee
held
a
conference
call
to
listen
to
our
cfo
brian
gladden
talk
about
management
s
projection
for
dell
s
future
financial
performance
representative
from
debevoise
plimpton
the
firm
the
committee
have
retain
as
its
legal
adviser
be
also
on
the
call
i
be
not
brian
as
the
sec
s
detailed
proxy
statement
would
later
note
present
the
update
outlook
for
fiscal
year
which
reflect
the
disappoint
number
and
rough
consumer
environment
we
d
take
note
of
in
july
but
he
say
that
other
than
modification
necessary
to
reflect
this
harsh
new
reality
management
projection
for
the
company
through
fiscal
year
remain
unchanged
the
special
committee
beg
to
differ
the
committee
ask
brian
to
revise
the
plan
to
reflect
a
less
rosy
projection
of
dell
s
future
financial
performance
they
also
ask
him
to
extend
the
forecast
out
to
fiscal
year
to
give
potential
bidder
for
the
company
enough
information
to
conduct
valuation
analysis
the
committee
then
met
in
executive
session
no
brian
no
me
to
discus
management
s
projection
as
the
proxy
statement
later
read
give
the
uncertainty
regard
the
company
s
future
performance
and
the
difficulty
experienced
by
the
company
s
management
in
meeting
its
estimate
over
the
prior
fiscal
quarter
the
special
committee
decide
to
continue
to
explore
potential
strategic
alternative
include
continue
to
execute
management
s
long
term
plan
and
remain
as
a
publicly
held
company
potential
change
to
that
plan
and
adjustment
in
the
management
team
in
plain
english
all
possibility
be
on
the
table
include
stay
public
and
include
the
possibility
of
replace
me


this
wasn
t
war
this
be
corporate
governance
work
the
way
corporate
governance
be
suppose
to
work
i
d
always
have
an
open
transparent
relationship
with
the
board
i
like
and
respect
every
member
and
i
m
pretty
sure
they
all
felt
the
same
about
me
i
never
want
to
be
the
gatekeeper
of
information
or
access
i
d
always
told
the
board
they
could
and
should
talk
to
anyone
at
the
company
they
want
to
talk
to
anytime
about
me
or
anybody
else
or
about
anything
at
all
but
the
board
s
ultimate
loyalty
be
to
dell
inc
and
its
shareholder
not
me
this
be
especially
true
of
the
new
special
committee
which
essentially
have
one
task
to
watch
like
a
hawk
every
possible
development
as
i
attempt
to
take
the
company
private
they
conduct
that
task
with
focus
determination
and
so
the
meeting
continued
meeting
upon
meeting
meeting
with
me
meeting
without
me
meeting
about
hold
far
meeting
some
be
purely
procedural
some
turn
out
to
have
real
significance
as
summer
turn
to
fall
i
kept
wonder
what
be
take
so
long
if
the
special
committee
really
thought
we
shouldn
t
go
private
couldn
t
they
just
say
so
we
could
all
get
back
to
do
what
we
d
be
do
and
go
on
about
our
business
but
the
committee
to
its
credit
be
be
extremely
thorough
a
few
day
after
that
conference
call
we
have
a
board
meeting
in
of
all
place
shanghai
every
so
often
we
would
convene
at
an
international
location
that
be
important
to
the
company
and
china
be
and
still
be
certainly
that
we
do
a
huge
amount
of
business
there
include
lending
our
name
to
some
twelve
thousand
partner
store
that
sell
our
product
the
dell
logo
with
its
distinctive
tilt
e
be
instantly
recognizable
even
in
country
that
don
t
use
the
english
alphabet
soon
after
we
arrive
i
ask
alex
mandl
if
we
could
have
a
chat
we
want
to
be
quite
careful
about
electronic
surveillance
we
be
in
china
after
all
so
we
decide
to
stroll
around
the
hotel
outdoors
while
we
talk
and
i
want
to
be
careful
about
show
my
frustration
at
the
length
of
the
process
but
at
the
same
time
i
couldn
t
completely
hide
it
so
as
politely
as
possible
i
ask
alex
in
essence
how
long
do
it
take
to
figure
out
whether
we
can
go
private
or
not
alex

a
strong
man

corporate
leader

politely

my
question
politely
gentleman
the
two
of
us
we
stroll
around
the
hotel
and
when
we
go
back
inside
i
knew
nothing
more
than
i
d
know
when
we
start


meanwhile
unbeknownst
to
me
the
expert
the
special
committee
have
retain
be
deliver
some
pretty
apocalyptic
assessment
of
the
state
of
dell
at
one
key
gathering
in
september
i
be
not
invite
j
p
morgan
the
financial
adviser
the
special
committee
have
retain
say
that
although
the
leveraged
buyout
market
be
strong
they
doubt
anyone
would
be
interested
in
buying
dell
give
our
large
market
capitalization
our
significant
exposure
in
the
ever
worsen
pc
market
the
recent
decline
in
our
operating
performance
and
by
the
way
the
absence
of
any
state
third
party
interest
in
acquire
the
company
over
the
past
couple
of
year
in
meeting
after
meeting
i
later
learn
the
expert
kept
hit
the
special
committee
with
what
they
felt
be
stark
realism
about
the
prospect
of
dell
s
foundational
product
and
cash
cow
for
decade
the
pc
the
pc
be
dead
or
die
or
at
best
flatlining
industry
analyst
be
predict
as
again
j
p
morgan
told
the
special
committee
in
early
october
that
the
pc
market
would
remain
flat
due
to
cannibalization
of
pc
usage
result
from
increase
adoption
of
tablet
and
smartphones
cannibalization
and
if
one
be
to
make
the
argument
as
i
have
be
try
to
do
that
we
weren
t
really
even
in
the
pc
business
anymore
that
we
be
shift
to
end
to
end
it
solution
software
and
service
well
the
expert
the
special
committee
have
hire
be
tell
the
committee
in
low
serious
voice
that
there
be
grave
risk
in
rely
on
that
decline
pc
business
to
fund
the
growth
of
our
new
business
if
you
listen
to
the
expert
in
other
word
we
be
pretty
much
screw


but
i
didn
t
think
we
be
screw
not
at
all
the
whole
reason
i
d
first
thought
about
go
private
back
in
and
the
reason
i
be
all
in
on
it
now
be
that
where
the
world
and
the
stock
market
saw
vulnerability
i
saw
opportunity
where
the
expert
saw
gloom
and
doom
i
saw
thrill
possibility
i
knew
that
opportunity
often
come
from
look
at
thing
differently
from
have
a
contrarian
perspective
it
would
have
be
unimaginable
for
me
to
move
ahead
with
a
go
private
if
everybody
include
industry
forecaster
be
say
the
pc
be
go
to
be
fine
yes
pc
sale
be
not
do
well
in
the
second
half
of
i
felt
that
be
happen
partly
because
microsoft
be
about
to
introduce
its
new
operating
system
window
and
people
be
wait
to
see
if
it
be
any
good
demand
often
pause
before
a
new
version
but
i
be
highly
optimistic
yes
smartphones
and
tablet
be
the
bright
shiny
object
of
the
moment
and
window
s
user
interface
have
be
specifically
design
to
work
well
with
tablet
include
microsoft
s
own
surface
tablet
their
answer
to
the
ipad
but
i
believe
that
those
device
as
sexy
as
they
might
have
be
be
not
go
to
replace
the
pc
they
be
go
to
add
to
it
people
might
bring
their
personal
device
to
the
office
but
i
thought
that
the
pc
s
value
as
the
essential
productivity
tool
especially
in
the
business
market
be
solid
i
believe
that
customer
would
read
on
their
smartphones
and
to
a
lesser
extent
on
their
tablet
and
work
on
their
pc
so
while
pc
sale
be
down
for
a
time
i
felt
this
wouldn
t
last
i
thought
that
while
customer
could
delay
replace
old
pc
for
a
little
while
they
wouldn
t
do
it
forever
i
believe
we
could
create
new
product
compelling
enough
to
drive
the
replacement
cycle
once
again
jeff
clarke
agree
jeff
our
vice
chairman
be
as
close
to
a
cofounder
as
i
have
he
d
join
dell
as
an
engineer
back
in
just
three
year
after
found
when
we
have
only
team
member
a
merry
band
of
mercenary
and
misfit
and
he
have
risen
through
the
rank
by
virtue
of
his
technical
expertise
he
quickly
distinguish
himself
as
a
brilliant
engineer
by
lead
the
design
of
successive
generation
of
our
desktop
product
with
a
superior
attention
to
detail
speed
and
execution
focus
he
have
an
uncanny
ability
to
design
motherboards
that
be
nearly
flawless
or
really
flawless
from
the
get
go
and
then
he
have
another
quality
that
emerge
quickly
tactical
brilliance
at
first
glance
jeff
be
a
good
ol
country
boy
from
san
antonio
an
air
force
brat
rough
around
the
edge
and
maybe
between
the
edge
too
but
that
be
just
at
first
glance
in
reality
he
knew
our
business
as
well
as
or
well
than
anyone
he
be
also
a
straight
shooter
constitutionally
incapable
of
tell
the
bos
what
he
want
to
hear
just
because
the
bos
be
the
bos
one
of
the
great
fear
face
by
anyone
who
succeed
be
living
in
a
bubble
of
good
news
and
hearing
just
what
you
want
to
hear
jeff
clarke
be
and
still
be
one
of
the
people
who
make
sure
that
be
not
the
case
but
when
i
told
jeff
about
my
intention
of
take
the
company
private
he
be
incredibly
excite
like
me
he
love
victory
play
nice
but
win
we
both
saw
go
private
as
a
way
of
liberate
the
company
of
reinvigorate
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
of
the
company
s
origin
of

more
aggressive
on
gain

add
sale
capacity
do
this
mean
you
d
unleash
me
to
be
competitive
again
in
the
pc
business
he
ask
absolutely
i
told
him
he
grin
like
a
kid
on
christmas
morning
pc
be
jeff

his
technological
true
love
the
great
general
purpose
business
productivity
device
ever
create
in
his
view
in
mine
too
of
course
and
as
head
of
product
and
operation
he
d
felt
the
financial
pressure
of
the
quarterly
shot
clock
as
acutely
as
anyone
in
the
company
he
knew
instantly
that
go
private
would
mean
change
dell
s
competitive
posture
from
offense
some
of
the
time
to
all
the
time
operating
as
a
private
company
would
give
us
the
freedom
to
price
our
pc
and
server
more
aggressively
yet
lower
price
alone
won
t
help
you
if
you
don
t
have
a
relationship
with
the
customer
go
private
would
free
us
to
hire
more
salesperson
and
expand
our
relationship
with
channel
partner
to
sell
more

and
new

capacity
have
often
be
key
to
our
growth
in
market
share
go

would
also
allow

to
increase
r
d
investment
which
would
drive
innovation
create
new

service
and

look

of

it
felt
as
though
the
world
be
crash
down
i
try
to
stay
as
hopeful
as
possible
and
i
compartmentalize
some
people
brag
about
their
ability
to
multitask
i
m
not
sure
how
well
i
can
do
that
but
one
thing
i
know
i
m
good
at
be
compartmentalize
when
you
re
lead
a
team
with
member
focus
intensely
on
one
thing
at
a
time
really
be
a
survival
skill
and
this
be
a
period
when
the
stake
be
unusually
high
i
have
to
lead
the
company
reassure
the
troop
oversee
our
ever
expand
slate
of
acquisition
travel
to
our
location
around
the
world
and
be
a
father
husband
son
and
brother
all
while
keep
an
absolute
secret
lock
on
my
plan
for
take
dell
private
it
be
difficult
and
awkward
to
say
the
least
i
couldn
t
talk
to
my
mother
and
father
about
it
i
couldn
t
talk
to
my
kid
about
it
i
couldn
t
talk
to
my
brother
about
it
there
be
just
a
handful
of
people
within
dell
i
could
take
into
confidence
my
wife
be
really
the
one
person
i
could
tell
everything
to
and
thank
god
for
her
in
so
many
way
but
especially
at
this
moment
we
talk
through
long
walk
and
bike
ride
talk
through
every
angle
of
this
thing
at
first
susan
didn
t
understand
why
i
be
take
this
on
at
all
why
mess
with
success
be
the
way
she
felt
about
it
and
not
just
because
she
s
my
ever
supportive
life
partner
she
understands
business
when
we
met
back
in
she
be
work
for
trammell
crow
which
at
the
time
be
one
of
the
most
successful
commercial
real
estate
company
in
north
america
susan
be
an
industrial
lease
agent
and
she
be
good
at
it
she
have
a
head
for
it
and
so
when
i
told
her
about
the
company
s
transformation
about
the
acquisition
that
cost
a
lot
but
could
blossom
into
so
much
more
about
my
optimistic
view
of
the
future
of
the
pc
she
saw
at
once
what
i
be
talk
about
and
knew
how
wrong
all
the
naysayer
out
there
be
there
be
a
lot
of
them
and
they
be
very
authoritative
and
opinionated
and
if
you
want
to
see
how
influential
they
be
all
you
have
to
do
be
look
at
the
price
of
our
stock
and
susan
understood
that
while
they
be
authoritative
and
opinionated
and
influential
they
be
wrong
so
we
kept
walk
and
we
kept
talk


the
data
room
it
sound
mysterious
like
something
out
of
a
spy
movie
but
in
reality
it
s
much
geekier
a
secure
online
share
storage
area
kind
of
like
dropbox
or
google
drive
where
document
be
place
so
that
different
party
can
sign
in
and
read
them
that
fall
we
create
a
data
room
contain
ton
of
information
about

historical
financial
information
of

straight
across
mile

i
can
remember
gaze
out
that
little
window
in
my
cinder

quite
different
in
both
the
dress

business
casual
the
atmosphere
friendly
and
collaborative
after
all
if
either
firm

offer

successful
we
would
be

married
as
partner
both
slp
and
kkr
come
with
a
list
of
key
question
or
topic
they
want
to
discus
we
as
management
be
there
to
answer
each
firm
s
question
and
help
them
understand
the
business
well
enough
that
they
could
fully
develop
their
offer
about
a
dozen
people
attend
each
meeting
from
dell
besides
me
it
be
cfo
brian
gladden
our
general
counsel
larry
tu
our
controller
tom
sweet
jeff
clarke
and
our
vp
for

debevoise
plimpton
and
a
banker
from

and
each

firm
sent
about
five
people
in
the
first
meeting
george
robert
lead
off
the
question
for
kkr
george
and
i
have
talk
so
many
time
at
this
point
that
we
jumped
right
in
kkr
mainly
want
to
know
how
our
financials
would
look
move
forward
would
we
be
able
to
recapture
the
market
share
that
have
erode
what
be
our
view
for
the
future
of
the
pc
what
do
we
expect
in
term
of
future
cash
flow
and
how
be
we
work
to
transform
the
company
when
silver
lake
come
a
week
later
they
be
certainly
interested
in
our
financials
but
there
be
more
much
more
that
they
want
to
talk
about
unlike
kkr
slp
be
a
technology
focus
private
equity
firm
and
everyone
at
the
meeting
include
egon
durban
come
from
slp
s
silicon
valley
office
they
all
understood
technology
very
well
they
spoke
our
language
from
the
outset
it
be
clear
that
the
silver
lake
team
understood
aspect
of
our
business
that
kkr
have
barely
ask
about
the
importance
of
acquisition
the
value
of
intellectual
property
the
nature
of
operating
system
cycle
because
they
d
be
born
as
a
technology
focus
private
equity
firm
they
actually
knew
something
about
technology
so
when
we
talk
about
virtualization
or
microprocessor
or
nand
flash
a
type
of
nonvolatile
storage
memory
that
doesn
t
require
power
to
retain
data
or
any
kind
of
intricate
thing
in
our
industry
they
would
understand
exactly
what
we
be
talk
about
and
silver
lake
knew
what
i
knew
that
even
if
window
didn
t
do
as
well
as
i
expect
microsoft
would
eventually
create
a
version
that
customer
want
and
our
pc
business
would
rebound
accordingly
they
understood
how
building
sale
capacity
and
add
new
customer
would
work
for
us
and
when
we
talk
about
how
new
development
in
cloud
storage
security
and
the
internet
of
thing
aka
iot
interrelate
compute
device
operating
without
human
interaction
would
affect
our
product
strategy
the
slp
team
understood
far
more
of
what
we
be
say
than
kkr
appear
to
on
october
twelve
day
after
the
silver
lake
meeting
both
kkr
and
slp
submit
preliminary
nonbinding
proposal
to
acquire
dell
inc
kkr
propose
a
purchase
price
of
per
share
for
all
our
outstanding
share
other
than
those
held
by
me
and
southeastern
all
of
which
they
assume
would
be
roll
over
in
the
transaction
and
contemplate
an
additional
million
investment
by
me
silver
lake
propose
a
purchase
price
of
per
share
for
all
our
outstanding
share
other
than
those
held
by
me
again
all
of
which
they
assume
would
be
roll
over
in
the
transaction
and
indicate
that
i
be
the
only
party
they
be
interested
in
partner
with
i
felt
both
firm
could
do
considerably
well
my
job
as
ceo
after
all
be
to
do
everything
i
could
to
increase
the
value
of
the
company
on
behalf
of
all
the
shareholder
and
so
by
letter
and
in
subsequent
meeting
at
my
house
i
encourage
kkr
and
silver
lake
to
improve
their
offer
i
stress
every
detail
about
dell
s
ongoing
transformation
that
might
ve
be
omit
or
underemphasized
at
the
due
diligence
meeting
i
ask
each
firm
to
put
forward
its
best
possible
offer
know
that
the
board
would
reject
any
offer
it
felt
be
inadequate
in
the
meantime
the
special
committee
retain
a
major
firm
boston
consult
group
bcg
to
explore
those
potential
strategic
alternative
they
kept
talk
about
also
in
the
meantime
window
come
out
to
say
the
least
microsoft
s
vaunt
new
operating
system
perform
contrary
to
my
expectation
the
hoopla
have
be
all
about
the
new
tablet
orient
user
interface
as
it
turn
out
user
hat
the
user
interface
it
s
the
edsel
of
operating
system
a
reviewer
for
pc
mag
com
write
no
one
be
sit
on
a
computer
say
wow
i
cannot
wait
to
upgrade
to
window
pc
sale
go
from
bad
to
bad
and
though
dell
inc
s
cash
flow
be
pretty
strong
billion
for
the
trail
twelve
month
our
earnings
be
hurt
now
part
of
the
reason
for
this
be
that
we
be
in
the
midst
of
our
transformation
we
be
invest
in
all
these
new
area
that
we
believe
in
deeply
but
investor
be
say
why
be
you
invest
in
these
new
area
they
re
not
generate
any
earnings
plus
you
ve
get
this
pc
business
that
s
struggle
we
don
t
really
think
much
of
the
company
on
november
our
financial
result
for
the
third
quarter
of
the
fiscal
year
come
out
the
number
weren
t
pretty
our
revenue
of
billion
be
million
below
the
midpoint
of
the
third
quarter
guidance
range
we
d
project
in
august
the
follow
day
the
market
price
of
dell
common
stock
fell
percent
to
per
share


a
whole
bunch
of
different
emotion
be
swirl
around
in
me
in
one
way
i
ll
admit
i
m
human
i
felt
abandon
by
the
public
shareholder
it
seem
like
they
d
just
totally
miss
the
whole
thing
they
didn
t
understand
what
we
be
do
they
didn
t
appreciate
the
company
they
didn
t
value
it
correctly
in
my
bad
moment
i
d
say
they
re
too
stupid
to
work
here
i
probably
shouldn
t
admit
that
i
apologize
dell
shareholder
but
at
the
time
with
so
much
go
on
my
compartmentalize
skill
notwithstanding
my
feeling
be
pitch
high
it
should
be
pretty
clear
to
you
by
now
that
i
m
an
optimist
by
nature
basically
i
just
feel
it
s
a
well
way
to
live
than
the
alternative
you
don
t
start
a
company
if
you
re
not
an
optimist
a
healthy
appetite
for
risk
help
too
i
believe
absolutely
in
our
transformation
i
knew
in
my
bone
that
this
bargain
basement
stock
price
didn
t
represent
a
nadir
in
our
fortune
but
an
amaze
opportunity
i
reemphasized
my
strong
opinion
on
both
count
to
kkr
and
silver
lake
but
both
firm
be
have
reservation
if
not
second
thought
about
what
in
the
dell
proxy
statement
s
word
be
become
a
litany
the
company
s
recent
failure
to
achieve
its
projection
the
increase
weakness
in
the
pc
market
the
company
s
loss
of
market
share
in
emerge
market
and
the
execution
risk
associate
with
evolve
into
an
es
enterprise
software
and
service
provider
four
day
after
thanksgiving
silver
lake
give
me
a
draft
revise
proposal
with
the
propose
purchase
price
left
blank
four
day
after
that
kkr
do
the
same
this
in
itself
wasn
t
very
significant
all
it
told
me
be
that
both
firm
be
still
on
board
and
run
the
number
and
i
have
commit
to
contribute
my
share
at
that
point
percent
of
the
company
at
whatever
price
a
successful
suitor
be
willing
to
pay
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
i
call
the
head
of
the
special
committee
alex
mandl
and
told
him
that
i
be
more
enthusiastic
than
ever
about
go
private
i
also
told
him
that
i
could
supply
as
much
additional
equity
as
might
be
need
for
the
transaction
at
the
same
time
both
alex
and
i
knew
that
there
be
a
ceiling
to
how
much
equity
i
should
contribute
dell
inc
s
spectacular
run
of
success
over
twenty
eight
year
which
really
mean
the
spectacular
success
of
an
amaze
and
ever
expand
team
have
make
many
team
member
and
me
very
well
off
in
theory
i
myself
could
ve
provide
all
the
equity
necessary
to
buy
back
my
excuse
me
the
company
but
that
would
ve
create
all
kind
of
potential
legal
problem
if
i
alone
be
set
the
share
price
for
the
go
private
it
wouldn
t
be
view
as
a
clean
price
discovery
because
i
be
the
ultimate
insider
with
nobody
invest
from
the
outside
the
board
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
compare
my
offer
to


on
november
i
met
with
boston
consult
group
the
top
executive
of
this
company
and
i
have
cross
path
many
time
but
these
be
not
the
top
executive
i
recognize
nobody
in
the
room
still
i
realize
that
the
special
committee
have
place
its
faith
in
them
as
adviser
and
i
give
them
the
respect
they
deserve
i
present
my
glass
half
full
view
of
the
transformation
they
show
their
most
serious
face
reveal
nothing
they
ask
some
point
question
about
dell
s
ability
to
cut
cost
and
regain
market
share
i
express
my
deeply
held
belief
that
these
be
hill
we
would
be
fully
able
to
climb
after
go
private
and
then
the
meeting
be
over
in
one
hour
flat
the
consultant
didn
t
want
me
for
two
hour
or
three
nor
do
they
ask
to
meet
again
that
be
the
last
i
saw
of
them


and
as
of
december
there
be
one
less
offer
that
day
george
robert
call
and
say
that
kkr
be
not
go
to
submit
a
second
offer
for
dell
the
reason
he
give
be
no
surprise
the
downward
trend
in
the
pc
business
industry
analyst
worry
about
the
competitive
pressure
dell
face
pressure
that
kkr
believe
to
have
be
validate
by
our
disappoint
third
quarter
number
no
hard
feeling
it
be
just
business
george
wish
me
a
lot
of
luck
and
i
believe
he
meant
it
be
i
disappointed
i
m
human
of
course
i
be
disappointed
but
i
didn
t
need
ten
private
equity
firm
to
help
me
go
private
i
thought
all
i
need
be
one
the
next
day
silver
lake
submit
an
update
nonbinding
proposal
to
acquire
the
company
for
per
share
two
day
later
december
i
met
with
the
entire
board
include
the
special
committee
first
alex
mandl
update
everyone
on
the
committee
s
work
and
the
contribution
of
j
p
morgan
and
bcg
both
of
whom
no
surprise
be
continue
to
hold
a
skeptical
view
of
the
go
private
then
i
give
a
presentation
this
be
my
board
i
be
their
chairman
and
yet
i
have
put
a
gap
between
them
and
me
i
have
introduce
new
idea
debatable
idea
idea
that
be
frighten
to
some
people
into
what
have
be
a
steady
if
problematic
state
a
very
large
very
prominent
global
corporation
with
grow
pain
i
be
the
captain
of
the
ship
someone
who
be
look
to
for
direction
and
certainty
but
now
someone
who
have
create
uncertainty
i
be
well
aware
of
my
role
and
my
responsibility
i
need
to
speak
with
certainty
to
reassure
but
i
felt
sure
and
so
i
spoke
calmly
but
passionately
about
my
conviction
that
take
the
company
private
be
the
best
possible
course
for
dell
for
our
stockholder
for
our
customer
and
i
told
the
attendee
what
i
plan
to
do
once
we
d
go
private
i
say
that
we
would
extend
the
company
s
enterprise
software
and
service
capability
through
significant
investment
in
research
and
development
and
additional
acquisition
i
say
that
we
would
hire
large
number
of
additional
sale
personnel
i
say
we
would
expand
in
emerge
market
i
say
we
would
invest
significantly
in
the
pc
business
these
step
i
say
be
the
sure
path
forward
and
yet
if
we
undertook
these
initiative
as
a
public
company
i
knew
and
everyone
in
the
room
knew
that
they
would
be
poorly
receive
by
the
stock
market
because
they
would
reduce
near
term
profitability
raise
operating
expense
and
capital
expenditure
and
involve
significant
risk
a
go
private
be
in
the
best
interest
of
dell
s
stockholder
i
maintain
because
they
would
receive
a
portion
of
the
potential
upside
from
these
initiative
in
the
form
of
a
premium
for
their
share
without
bearing
the
risk
and
uncertainty
related
to
execute
the
initiative
finish
with
my
pitch
i
nod
once
and
look
at
the
familiar
face
around
the
long
table
their
expression
be
noncommittal
they
have
question
why
be
silver
lake
the
right
partner
for
this
process
should
the
board
try
to
bring
in
another
suitor
or
two
while
the
discussion
be
still
private
or
at
the
risk
of
unleash
force
we
couldn
t
anticipate
or
control
should
we
go
public
with
the
plan
i
reiterate
my
belief
that
slp
with
its
tech
root
and
expertise
would
be
a
superb
partner
on
the
other
hand
i
say
i
be
completely
open
to
consider
any
suitor
the
board
might
want
to
introduce
go
private
be
a
monumental
step
as
everyone
in
the
room
knew
well
no
option
for
get
the
best
possible
deal
for
our
shareholder
should
be
overlook
but
what
if
after
all
of
this
a
deal
simply
couldn
t
be
make
i
m
ready
to
stay
on
as
ceo
if
we
stay
public
i
say
i
m
ready
to
stay
on
and
try
to
execute
as
much
of
my
plan
as
possible
under
those
condition
but
i
can
promise
you
this
the
market
won
t
be
happy
and
neither
will
the
stockholder


december
be
an
eventful
month
to
put
it
mildly
little
do
i
know
that
the
come
month
would
make
that
december
look
placid
as
the
special
committee
and
its
adviser
and
my
executive
team
and
i
consider
every
possible
angle
of
the
go
private
everything
proceed
under
the
strict
rule
of
legal
and
financial
propriety
yet
powerful
feeling
all
around
churn
beneath
the
surface
layer
of
corporate
correctness
the
day
after
my
presentation
to
the
board
alex
mandl
on
the
recommendation
of
j
p
morgan
which
felt
it
be
important
for
this
process
to
have
more
than
one
potential
sponsor
contact
the
private
equity
firm
tpg
texas
pacific
group
and
invite
it
to
make
a
proposal
to
acquire
dell
tpg
agree
to
consider
make
a
proposal
sign
a
confidentiality
agreement
and
be
grant
access
to
the
data
room
on
the
eleventh
i
met
with
a
group
of
tpg
partner
at
a
law
office
in
downtown
austin
to
describe
dell
and
our
transformation
in
progress
and
to
answer
their
question
they
be
smart
they
be
sharp
still
in
my
heart
of
heart
i
still
felt
silver
lake
be
the
only
firm
that
really
spoke
our
language
but
the
day
before
december
mandl
told
silver
lake
that
its
offer
price
of
be
too
low
and
that
the
special
committee
would
only
allow
slp
to
continue
in
the
process
if
slp
make
a
materially
high
offer
egon
durban
then
ask
the
committee
s
permission
to
seek
financing
from
microsoft
alex
told
egon
he
would
discus
the
request
with
the
committee
and
its
adviser
when
one
of
the
lead
attorney
from
debevoise
contact
egon
that
afternoon
to
discus
the
microsoft
request
egon
say
that
silver
lake
would
not
continue
in
the
process
unless
it
be
permit
to
talk
to
microsoft
the
next
day
as
i
be
meeting
with
the
tpg
partner
the
special
committee
decide
to
allow
slp
to
discus
debt
financing
with
microsoft
and
a
small
number
of
bank
provide
that
all
party
sign
confidentiality
agreement
over
the
next
couple
of
day
dell
enter
into

agreement
with
royal
bank
of
canada
credit
suisse
barclays
and
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
and
a
meeting
between
silver
lake
me
and
my
team
and
the
bank
be
set
for
december
i
flew
to
new
york
on
sunday
even
the
sixteenth
arrive
in
time
to
have
dinner
with
alexa
the
meeting
take
place
at
the
next
morning
in
silver
lake
s
office
in
the
slope
front
glass
tower
at
west
fifty
seventh
street
it
be
a
cool
foggy
day
in
manhattan
the
city
be
packed
with
holiday
shopper
and
sightseer
we
met
in
a
massive
conference
room
on
the
thirty
second
floor
and
there
be
a
lot
of
people
present
besides
me
brian
gladden
and
egon
and
his
team
each
bank
have
brought
around
a
dozen
people
there
be
a
bevy
of
lawyer
and
as
i
look
around
this
crowd
room
i
felt
scar
not
scar
of
anyone
present
or
of
anything
that
be
about
to
happen
at
the
meeting
that
be
all
good
it
be
move
the
process
along
no
what
frighten
me
be
that
i
found
it
absolutely
impossible
to
conceive
that
among
this
crowd
of
principal
and
ancillaries
some
knucklehead
wouldn
t
breathe
a
single
word
about
the
proceeding
afterward
to
a
wife
a
husband
a
girlfriend
or
boyfriend
it
seem
highly
probable
to
me
that
news
of
the
meeting
would
leak
and
that
if
it
do
the
go
private
would
almost
certainly
wilt
on
the
vine


but
it
didn
t
happen
there
be
no
word
that
week
or
the
week
after
after
the
big
meeting
i
flew
directly
back
to
austin
and
have
dinner
with
david
bonderman
the
cofounder
of
tpg
and
john
marren
his
head
of
technology
investment
to
talk
about
the
possibility
of
their
partner
with
me
they
have
the
kind
of
question
i
d
anticipate
i
have
good
answer
the
atmosphere
be
low
key
and
cordial
but
a
week
later
jim
coulter
david
s
partner
in
found
the
firm
and
marren
call
me
to
say
that
for
a
variety
of
reason
include
the
size
of
the
equity
check
that
would
be
require
and
their
concern
about
the
bank
financing
they
be
not
go
to
submit
an
offer
for
the
company
i
call
alex
to
let
him
know
i
would
later
find
out
what
have
really
be
bother
tpg
that
old
chestnut
the
decline
in
the
pc
business
not
to
mention
the
decrease
in
our
operating
performance
so
we
be
back
down
to
one
suitor
and
talk
between
silver
lake
and
the
special
committee
talk
to
which
i
be
not
privy
continued
to
ping
pong
back
and
forth
back
and
forth


the
holiday
season
come
and
go
on
january
as
i
later
found
out
bcg
s
consultant
met
with
the
special
committee
and
deliver
a
pessimistic
financial
forecast
for
dell
of
particular
concern
to
them
be
our
end
user
compute
euc
business
pc
monitor
and
other
accessory
the
consultant
project
a
continue
shift
in
the
overall
euc
market
from
the
so
call
high
margin
premium
segment
where
we
have
be
the
undisputed
leader
for
a
long
time
to
a
low
margin
segment
namely
cheaper
pc
manufacture
in
asia
they
also
predict
that
the
euc
market
in
toto
might
decline
by
as
much
as
billion
over
the
next
four
year
they
voiced
a
concern
that
dell
s
relationship
with
exist
customer
and
vendor
could
deteriorate
as
we
continued
to
transition
to
other
business
and
for
good
measure
they
remind
the
committee
that
although
over
the
past
four
year
we
d
use
some
billion
of
our
cash
resource
to
fund
acquisition
in
enterprise
software
and
solution
percent
of
our
revenue
still
come
from
our
euc
and
euc
driven
business
the
very
business
they
be
so
bearish
about
happy
new
year
and
yet
two
day
later
on
january
all
four
bank
we
d
met
with
royal
bank
of
canada

of
america
merrill
lynch
come
back
with
strong
offer
and
full
support
for
the
go
private
soon
microsoft
would
commit
to
partner
with
us
in
a
go
private
with
a
loan
of
billion
strictly
speak
we
didn
t
need
their
loan
but
the
way

allow
us
to
low
the
interest
rate
on
the
money
we

on
our
way

spent
the
next

with
one
of
the
unnamed
source

which
of
course

half
right
when

one
of
the
source
say
possibly
as
early
as
that
week
which
turn
out
to
be
considerably
premature
but
in
a
certain
way
it
didn
t
matter
what
the
detail
be
our
go
private
be
now
thoroughly
public
and
the
seed
of
chaos

sown

start
me
up
it
be
the
summer
of
and
i
have
time
on
my
hand
a
lot
of
it
kind
of
new
territory
for
me
some
kid
take
the
summer
off
after
they
graduate
high
school
to
smell
the
rose
before
move
on
to
the
serious
business
of
start
college
and
begin
to
grow
up
a
lot
of
kid
i
knew
from
memorial
high
spent
much
of
that
summer
go
down
to
san
marcos
and
tube
on
the
river
as
you
can
probably
guess
by
now
this
wasn
t
my
way
it
s
not
that
i
be
averse
to
have
fun
it
s
just
that
i
have
a
different
idea
of
fun
than
most
kid
my
age
i
didn
t
have
a
summer
job
per
se
that
year
to
all
appearance
and
as
far
as
my
parent
knew
i
be
idle
a
rise
ut
freshman
tool
back
and

i
love

but
there
be
another

that
come
in
much
handier
for
the

an
ever
grow
need
and
that
coupe
de
ville
come
in
very
handy
for
transport
the
raw
stock
i
need
to
meet
that
need
new
ibm
pc
which
come
in
pretty
enormous
box
but
the
enormousness
of
the
box
be
match
by
the
cavernous
size
of
the
car
s
trunk
which
could
hold
three
of
those
bad
boy
and
the
back
seat
which
after
you
slid
the
front
seat
up
as
far
as
it
would
go
and
tilt
the
seat
back
forward
no
back
door
in
a
coupe
de
ville
and
squeeze
each
box
through
could
accommodate
four
two
more
box
could
be
stack
in
the
front
passenger
seat
i
m
sure
i
make
quite
a
sight
as
i
drove
down
interstate
chubby
cheeked
boy
with
curly
hair
and
big
glass
at
the
wheel
of
a
tremendous
cadillac
fill
with
giant
box
its
rear
end
droop
under
the
weight
of
all
those
computer
and
then
there
be
my
other
business
ibm
pc
sell
like
crazy
from
the
moment
they
be
introduce
but
what
that
huge
demand
lead
to
be
all
kind
of
supply
disparity
among
the
retail
outlet
that
carry
the
product
houston
might
order
ten
thousand
unit
dallas
another
ten
thousand
phoenix
another
ten
thousand
but
ibm
couldn
t
push
out
all
that
supply
in
time
so
some
of
those
dealer
would
wind
up
get
only
four
or
five
thousand
unit
at
a
time
in
response
the
dealer
start
overordering
ask
for
twenty
thousand
or
fifty
thousand
computer
at
a
clip
just
so
they
could
get
what
they
need
the
result
be
retail
chaos
one
city
would
have
way
too
much
stock
another
not
nearly
enough
i
picked
up
on
this
i
m
not
sure
i
knew
the
word
arbitrage
at
that
point
but
the
concept
namely
that
i
could
make
some
money
from
these
supply
incongruity
come
to
me
in
a
flash
all
i
have
to
do
i
realize
be
go
to
a
city
that
have
a
surplus
of
pc
buy
a
bunch
then
take
them
to
another
city
that
have
a
shortage
and
sell
them
sound
simple
it
really
be
thus
begin
the
fly
and
buy
i
would
locate
a
big
retail
outlet
that
have
way
overbought
ibm
pc
say
a
computerland
in
phoenix
then
call
them
up
and
ask
if
i
could
take
some
off
their
hand
that
would
sound
great
to
them
so
great
that
in
many
case
they
d
agree
to
sell
me
some
of
their
surplus
for
below
their
cost
i
d
get
on
a
southwest
airline
flight
to
phoenix
rent
a
big
u
haul
truck
which
in
those
day
believe
it
or
not
it
be
possible
for
an
eighteen
year
old
to
do
then
go
to
computerland
hand
them
a
cashier
s
check
and
load
the
thirty
or
forty
pc
into
the
truck
and
drive
to
some
store
that
be
undersupplied
say
a
businessland
in
tucson
and
sell
them
my
truckful
at
or
or
per
machine
over
what
i
d
paid
result
instant
profit
of
a
couple
of
thousand
buck
you
may
be
pause
a
moment
here
to
do
a
mental
calculation
do
an
eighteen
year
old
who
wasn
t
deal
drug
really
have
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
dollar
at
a
time
to
lay
out
for
those
new
computer
and
the
answer
be
yup
my
pc
upgrade
business
be
do
well
enough
that
i
have
steady
cash
flow
and
my
computer
resell
business
be
profitable
from
the
jump
after
a
little
while
i
discover
you
could
ship
big
box
very
cheaply
by
greyhound
bus
so
if
i
be
arbitrage
between
computer
store
within
texas
i
could
send
a
check
to
a
guy
in
san
antonio
with
too
many
pc
on
his
hand
have
him
take
the
computer
to
the
bus
station
and
put
them
on
a
greyhound
then
pick
them
up
myself
in
dallas
or
houston
or
austin
and
take
them
to
a
store
that
need
extra
if
there
be
more
than
five
or
ten
of
them
i
d
get
one
of
my
buddy
and
say
hey
you
want
to
come
with
me
and
do
this
thing
and
i
ll
pay
you
some
money
then
he
d
bring
his
car
and
help
me
out
and
so
the
summer
pass
i
didn
t
get
around
to
tube
on
the
san
marcos
but
i
do
make
some
nice
money

very
different
time

convince
them
to
give
me
a
cable
feed
for

be
from
texas
and
most
of
them
be
from
the
state

experiment
in
cable
broadcasting
be
strictly
for
fun
nobody

dime
for
it
still
when
the
building
management
found
out
about
it
they
be
not
amuse
you
can
t
do

one
night
i
met
them
there
just
before

i
could
see
the
moment

both
very
upset
michael

it
sound
kind
of
unsavory
well
kind
of
both
i
guess
i
say
not
very
truthfully
i
could
see
that
my
mom
be
about
to
cry
that
s
something
no
son
ever
want
to
see

nice
hobby
for
you
but

life
i
be
star
at
the
floor

and
proud

same
time

and
rebellious

have
no
idea

my
dad

t

here

one
thing
and
one
thing

to
get
the
education
you

the
right
path

mutter
something
about

be
so
sure
the
path
he
be
talk
about
be
the
right
path
for

at
my
mother

tear
be
flow
now
and
she
have
both
hand
on
the
neckline
of
her
dress
michael

begin
and
then
she
say
my
name
again
michael
the
gesture
she
be
make
be
more
than
a
gesture
she
actually
look
as
though
she
be
about
to
rend
her
garment
an
ancient
jewish
expression
of
bereavement
right
there
in
a
room
at
the
hyatt
regency
austin
she
be
lay
five
thousand
plus
year
of
jewish
guilt
on
my
head
tell
me
that
if
i
kept
go
the
way
i
be
go
i
would
be
dead
to
her
wow
naturally
i
cave
i
be
cry
my
mother
and
father
be
cry
when
i
be
finally
able
to
summon
a
semblance
of
composure
i
blew
my
nose
and
look
at
them
okay
i
say
they
be
star
at
me
it
s
a
pretty
powerful
thing
when
both
your
parent
be
star
at
you
like
that
okay
i
repeat
no
more
computer
only
school
only
school
i
promise
i
really
do
mean
it
but
all
i
be
feel
be
pain


for
the
next
ten
day
i
go
cold
turkey
i
literally
didn
t
touch
a
computer
no
memory
upgrade
no
hard
drive
installation
no
fly
and
buy
no
byte
or
pc
magazine
i
go
to
my
class
and
try
my
hardest
to
pay
attention
i
take
note
for
my
tech
jones
i
thought
it
might
help
to
turn
my
attention
to
another
enthusiasm
of
mine
high
end
audio
i
love
listen
to
rock
n
roll
roll
stone
the
door
jimi
hendrix
queen
roxy
music
and
i
like
it
loud
in
those
just
on
the
cusp
of
cd
day
audiophiles
still
go
gaga
for
thorens
turntable
harman
kardon
receiver
big
klipsch
speaker
in
my
spare
time
i
frequent
the
high
end
audiophile
store
in
austin
hop
the
look
and
smell
of
those
beautiful
component
would
ease
my
crave
for
memory
card
and
motherboards
and
bios
chip
not
to
mention
the
thrill
i
get
from
just
be
in
the
computer
business
it
didn
t
help
in
fact
what
those
ten
day
of
intense
longing
really
do
for
me
be
focus
my
mind
intensely
i
realize
that
the
prospect
of
practice
medicine
in
any
specialty
held
absolutely
no
appeal
for
me
and
that
the
prospect
of
building
my
work
life
on
computer
be
more
than
appeal
it
be
absolutely
thrill
so
i
arrive
at
a
very
eighteen
year
old
type
of
stratagem
i
would
go
back
to
my
computer
business
and
i
wouldn
t
tell
my
parent
brilliant
right
besides
it
be
the
eve
of
christmas
break
i
could
restart
without
have
to
worry
about
go
to
class
but
it
have
become
clear
to
me
that
a
little
dorm
room
on
the
twenty
seventh
floor
of
a
high
rise
be
grossly
inadequate
for
store
inventory
if
i
be
go
to
go
back
into
this
thing
full
bore
i
be
go
to
need
a
lot
more
space
than
i
have
up
at
the
top
of
dobie
thus
with
plenty
of
work
capital
still
in
the
bank
i
decide
to
get
another
place
of
my
own
at
the
begin
of
january
i
move
into
a
condo
complex
a
couple
of
block
north
of
campus
at
duval
street
it
be
the
nice
building
in
the
area
it
have
a
gate
underground
garage
for
my
beemer
and
i
get
one
of
the
nice
unit
in
it
a
two
bedroom
apartment
on
the
third
floor
i
intentionally
chose
the
top
story
because
the
apartment
up
there
have
double
height
ceiling
perfect
for
stack
inventory
and
very
soon
there
be
a
lot
of
new
inventory
by
the
time
second
semester
begin
i
be
back
in
business
big
time
upgrade
fly
and
buying
resell
i
decide
if
i
be
really
go
to
be
a
business
i
need
to
act
and
look
like
a
business
so
i
look
up
how
to
set
up
a
proper
d
b
a
structure
then
file
the
paperwork
to
become
a
sole
proprietor
do
business
as
pc
s
limited
not
exactly
a
genius
name
but
since
my
upgrade
basically
seem
to
sell
themselves
sexy
marketing
be
the
least
of
my
worry
my
parent
be
something
else
again
by
the
end
of
february
i
be
spending
even
less
time
on
my
schoolwork
than
i
have
during
first
semester
the
time
be
clearly
approach
when
i
d
need
to
fes
up
to
my
mom
and
dad
but
right
around
then
i
make
a
very
useful
discovery
about
a
special
provision
in
the
university
of
texas
rule
book
namely
that
it
be
possible
to
take
a
semester
off
and
then
reregister
at
a
later
date
with
no
academic
penalty
that
be
definitely
something
i
could
tell
my
parent
just
as
soon
as
i
get
around
to
broaching
the
subject


meanwhile
i
kept
shuttle
around
austin
with
my
little
crew
of
helper
do
installation
on
weekend
i
continued
to
fly
around
texas
and
arizona
buying
pc
and
sell
them
back
the
money
kept
come
in
and
my
overhead
be
low
my
condo
unit
be
right
next
door
to
the
landlady
s
liba
taub
be
her
name
if
she
ever
caught
a
glimpse
of
all
the
computer
box
stack
to
the
foot
ceiling
of
my
double
height
apartment
she
didn
t
seem
concerned
i
be
a
nice
young
man
i
paid
my
rent
on
time
i
didn
t
have
wild
party
during
spring
break
that
year
i
go
with
my
mom
and
dad
and
adam
to
england
to
visit
steven
my
old
brother
the
smartest
of
the
three
of
us
have
graduate
from
college
in
three
and
a
half
year
and
gotten
into
baylor
medical
school
so
he
have
six
month
off
which
he
d
decide
to
spend
be
a
bartender
in
london
it
be
my
first
trip
abroad
and
we
make
all
the
touristy
stop
the
tower
of
london
windsor
castle
parliament
but
i
also
make
some
side
trip
of
my
own
to
look
into
what
really
fascinate
me
about
england
for
one
thing
this
be
around
the
time
that
audio
cd
be
be
introduce
to
the
general
public
and
for
whatever
reason
the
new
technology
have
take
off
faster
in
the
uk
than
in
the
us
you
could
go
into
the
hmv
music
store
and
buy
lot
and
lot
of
album
on
compact
disk
i
couldn
t
get
over
how
clear
and
beautiful
the
audio
quality
be
and
i
couldn
t
wait
to
hear
it
through
the
big
klipsch
speaker
i
d
bought
for
my
new
apartment
but
the
other
thing
that
impressed
me
be
the
profusion
of
computer
store
and
just
like
in
the
us
the
profound
ignorance
of
the
people
who
work
in
them
in
england
as
in
the
state
these
store
be
sell
pc
consist
of
or
dollar
worth
of
component
for
the
equivalent
of
or
more
and
the
salesperson
knew
little
to
nothing
about
how
these
computer
work
nor
do
the
store
offer
much
in
the
way
of
service
and
support
neither
the
customer
nor
the
retailer
seem
to
care
everyone
want
computer
and
the
pound
and
shilling
be
fly
it
be
on
this
trip
that
my
mom
suddenly
start
feel
exhaust
all
the
time
when
we
get
back
home
she
go
to
her
doctor
and
soon
get
the
diagnosis
we
all
fear
she
have
non
hodgkin
s
lymphoma
but
the
cancer
specialist
at
md
anderson
in
houston
be
hopeful
and
so
be
we
we
all
knew
what
a
fighter
mom
be
after
we
return
to
texas
i
broke
the
news
to
my
parent
with
all
the
assurance
i
could
muster
i
told
them
the
truth
not
only
be
i
run
a
business
that
be
consistently
gross
over
a
month
but
i
also
believe
i
could
build
it
substantially
and
there
be
more
good
news
i
told
them
i
could
leave
ut
with
no
academic
penalty
and
reenroll
at
a
future
date
if
want
i
give
them
my
solemn
promise
that
if
my
commercial
venture
didn
t
work
out
i
would
go
back
to
school
i
won
t
pretend
that
they
be
thrill
there
be
a
lot
of
frown
and
head
shake
but
eventually
they
agree
grudgingly
it
would
take
a
few
year
for
my
relationship
with
mom
and
dad
to
heal
still
they
be
logical
people
who
understood
a
bottom
line
they
saw
the
logic
of
my
choice
even
if
they
wish
it
otherwise
and
the
sad
truth
be
that
my
mom
be
probably
too
tire
to
argue
with
me


a
couple
week
later
i
get
a
phone
call
from
kelley
guest
kelley
a
partner
at
a
law
firm
in
town
have
bought
a
few
hard
disk
upgrade
kit
from
me
both
for
himself
and
several
other
people
in
his
office
i
ve
be
think
that
you
should
incorporate
he
say
how
come
i
ask
kelley
told
me
that
if
my
business
kept
go
the
way
it
be
go
i
might
soon
be
hire
people
to
help
me
on
a
full
time
basis
offering
fringe
benefit
like
medical
coverage
he
say
would
be
the
surest
way
to
attract
quality
people
and
own
a
corporation
would
allow
me
to
set
up
medical
and
other
kind
of
employee
benefit
he
also
say
there
be
certain
tax
advantage
available
to
an
expand
corporation
that
wouldn
t
be
applicable
to
a
sole
proprietor
he
could
do
the
paperwork
pretty
easily
he
told
me
sound
okay
i
say
what
s
it
go
to
cost
me
well
i
need
another
one
of
those
upgrade
kit
kelley
say
so
why
don
t
we
make
a
trade
i
ll
do
your
incorporation
and
you
install
the
hard
drive
kit
and
we
ll
call
it
a
deal
that
sound
good
to
me
so
i
instal
the
kit
and
kelley
drew
up
the
paper
but
then
he
call
me
back
and
say
michael
there
be
a
small
hitch
we
couldn
t
incorporate
under
the
name
pc
s
limited
because
it
s
too
generic
so
i
call
the
company
dell
computer
corporation
and
you
can
be
do
business
as
pc
s
limited
fine
i
say
no
problem
one
more
thing
kelley
say
it
turn
out
you
ve
get
to
pay
a
thousand
dollar
if
you
want
to
incorporate
in
texas
you
may
think
that
with
or
in
gross
revenue
every
month
i
d
consider
a
mere
thousand
a
pittance
this
be
not
the
case
not
only
do
i
have
to
pay
rent
on
my
condo
but
as
always
almost
everything
i
be
take
in
be
go
right
back
out
again
primarily
to
buy
new
inventory
i
be
living
on
a
pretty
thin
margin
i
ve
get
to
go
sell
some
more
stuff
i
told
him
i
ll
be
back
to
you
in
a
few
day
i
sell
the
stuff
and
on
may
my
little
one
man
operation
formally
become
dell
computer
corporation
d
b
a
pc
s
limited
it
be
just
two
week
until
final
exam
i
take
them
and
pass
by
the
skin
of
my
teeth
then
i
left
school
forever


a
real
business
i
felt
should
have
a
real
office
soon
after
i
incorporate
i
sign
a
lease
on
a
square
foot
space
in
an
office
complex
a
few
mile
north
of
downtown
austin
unit
f
at
north
lamar
and
soon
after
that
i
make
my
first
hire
terry
hostetler
be
the
manager
of
a
local
store
call
the
software
place
we
met
when
i
sell
the
store
a
demonstrator
computer
and
we
clicked
right
away
we
be
both
super
excite
about
the
pc
revolution
and
our
interest
kind
of
dovetail
terry
knew
an
awful
lot
about
software
i
be
more
of
a
hardware
guy
he
be
smart
he
be
mature
he
be
twenty
three
to
my
nineteen
and
he
be
married
which
seem
very
grown
up
to
me
and
we
like
talk
about
technology
a
lot
we
even
have
similar
sens
of
humor
i
felt
i
d
found
a
friend
one
day
we
go
out
to
lunch
together
and
afterward
we
drove
around
austin
in
my
bmw
talk
about
our
hope
and
dream
one
of
my
idea
i
told
terry
be
to
buy
a
computerland
or
businessland
franchise
and
leverage
it
into
something
big
in
my
exploration
around
town
i
d
spent
some
time
at
a
store
call
compuadd
which
sell
computer
component
rather
than
computer
and
met
the
owner
a
guy
name
bill
hayden
hayden
told
me
that
thanks
to
austin
s
tech
boom
he
be
really
make
big
buck
i
guess
he
thought
he
be
just
impress
some
punk
kid
but
when
i
size
him
up
i
thought
i
could
do
everything
he
be
do
and
a
lot
more
be
i
a
little
full
of
myself
at
nineteen
sure
i
be
i
think
you
have
to
be
to
do
anything
important
you
ll
have
realize
by
now
that
i
m
a
pretty
competitive
person
and
i
thought
i
have
all
kind
of
idea
that
bill
hayden
could
never
even
begin
to
imagine
one
of
my
idea
be
just
an
expansion
of
what
i
be
already
do
place
ad
and
take
order
over
the
phone
for
memory
kit
and
hard
drive
kit
and
upgraded
pc
i
be
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
the
low
price
for
computer
component
and
i
felt
i
could
save
customer
the
trouble
of
comparison
shopping
pas
along
the
saving
to
them
and
still
make
a
profit
and
my
upgraded
machine
which
contain
those
component
be
both
well
and
less
expensive
than
the
ibm
or
compaq
pc
that
consumer
could
find
in
retail
store
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
unlike
retail
store
i
be
prepared
to
offer
reliable
and
free
tech
support
up
to
now
i
d
just
be
place
ad
in
austin
but
with
a
couple
of
people
answer
phone
for
me
i
figure
i
could
advertise
nationally
say
in
pc
week
and
computer
shopper
both
of
which
have
short
enough
lead
time
that
i
could
maintain
control
over
pricing
customer
could
call
in
from
wherever
and
tell
us
what
kind
of
memory
or
hard
drive
kit
they
want
or
if
they
be
order
an
upgraded
computer
tell
us
how
much
memory
they
want
in
their
machine
what
size
hard
drive
how
fast
a
processor
once
they
give
us
a
credit
card
number
we
could
send
out
the
kit
or
put
together
a
customize
computer
for
them
in
an
hour
or
so
and
ship
it
out
the
same
day
it
sound
simple
yet
nobody
else
be
do
it
terry
listen
carefully
to
everything
i
be
say
he
told
me
he
too
have
dream
of
start
his
own
tech
business
in
austin
and
that
what
i
be
talk
about
sound
cool
why
don
t
you
come
work
with
me
i
say
he
didn
t
hesitate
okay

the
sheer

his
head

mind
but
he
wouldn

about
to

the
company
completely
unknown
they
be
start
to
get
cold
foot
meanwhile
all
we
could
say
be
we
don
t
comment
on
rumor
and
speculation
i
kept
try
to

and
i
each
have
a
vision
of
how
to
do
right
by
our
shareholder
but
our
vision
weren
t
line
up
the
talk
begin
bright
and
early
thursday
morning
in
debevoise
plimpton
s
manhattan
office
and
they
be
intense
from
the
begin
though
silver
lake
and
i
have
clearly
demonstrate
that
we
have
the
financing
in
place
to
pay
what
we
thought
be
an
eminently
fair
price
for
the
company
i
d
agree
to
accept
per
share
for
my
million
share
and
silver

be
offering

every
paragraph
if
there
be
any
chance
of
get
shareholder
a
well
price
they
be
determine
to

suitor
the
term
of
art
for
this
process
be
a
go
shop
but
they
be
prepared
to
make
an
extraordinary
offer
dell

consider
pay
all
the
cost
that
any
qualify
suitor
would
incur
in
do
due
diligence
on

same
letter
as
the
name
of
the
actual
entity
or
person
you
re
talk
about
but
i
d
first
learn
of
it
over
the
summer
when
somebody
on
our
team
start
talk
about
denali
what
s
denali

both
side
of
the
deal
sat
in
that
conference
room
at
debevoise
and
talk
and
talk
sometimes
we
would
hit
an
impasse
over
one
deal
term
or
another
and
egon
and
i
would
go
out
and
take
a
long
walk
in
central
park
to
clear
our
head
before
return
to
the
bargaining
table
by
saturday
night
february
i
really
need
a
break
so
i
take
my
daughter
alexa

be
living
in
new
york
at
that
point
to
a
knicks
game
at
madison
square
garden
i
d
splurge
on
courtside
seat
which
be
great
but
try
as
i
might
i
couldn
t
stay
focus
on
the
game
my
brain
be
in
overdrive
i
just
couldn
t
stop
think
about
those
negotiation
all
the
while
strive
against
all
odds
to
keep
a
poker
face
i
remember
have
the
absurd
thought
well
if
i
m
here
look
like
i
m
enjoy
the
game
and
i
have
no
other
care
on
my
mind
then
maybe
they
ll
think
the
rumor
aren
t
true
easy
say
than
do
whether
i
be
sit
in
my
fold
chair
on
the
garden
floor
or
go
to
the
snack
stand
at
halftime
i
felt
like
i
be
in
a
mosh
pit
of
interested
party
spike
lee
be
sit
nearby
as

his
eyebrow
and
say
interest
news
of
course
i
knew
exactly
what
he
be
talk
about
and
of
course
there
be
nothing
i
could
say
back
to
him
except
yeah
how
about
this
game
i
return
to
the
hotel
afterward
but
sleep
wasn
t
easy
to
come
by
that
night
i
d
expect
the
negotiation
to
be
wrap
up
by
sunday
at
the
late
but
everything
be
still
up
in
the
air
we
be
at
a
point
where
either
this
be
go
to
get
resolve
in
fairly
short
order
or
it
be
just
not

with
the
loan
that
be
one
piece
of
good
news
but
we
still
need
several
more
at
a
m
another

from
my

be
rush
the
dividend
be
nonnegotiable
he

me
and
the

so
we
get
back

the
big
game
egon
and
i
and
our
various
representative
spent
super
bowl
sunday
try
to
figure
out
how
we
could
possibly
raise
our
offer
by
late
that
night
miss
the
game
raven
beat
the
er
we
be
still
deliberate
as
buyer
naturally
silver
lake
and
i
want
to
pay
as
little
for
the
company
as
possible
but
we
also
want
the
deal
to
go
through
silver
lake
figure
they
be
set
the
price
not
me
that
add
a
nickel
to
our
previous
offer
at
a
cost
to
us
of
five
cent
time
billion
share
million
would
make
a
substantial
difference
in
the
board
s
eye
and
wouldn
t
make
a
big
difference
to
us
if
as
we
anticipate
our
thesis
be
correct
and
take
the
company
private
would
lead
over
time
to
a
great
increase
in
its
value
and
if
our
thesis
be
incorrect
and
we
lose
and
we
didn
t
think
we
would
lose
we
would
be
out
a
great
deal
more
money
than
million
and
so
early
monday
morning
silver
lake
and
i
agree
to
raise
our
offer
by
a
nickel
a
share
to
and
we
agree
the
company
would
continue
to
pay
its
regular
quarterly
dividend
egon

just
the
begin


the

immediate
and
big
naturally
every

in

that
the
potential
buyout
would
be
the
big
of
its
kind
since
the
financial
crisis
but
call
the
move
risky
and
in
effect
an
admission
by
me
that
i
wasn
t
able
to
pull
off
the
change
need
to
improve
my
company
s
revenue
and
profit
under
wall
street
s
glare
i
be
they
write
a
man
increasingly
worried
about
his
legacy
it
have
be
year
unnamed
source
told
the
journal
since
mr
dell
show
the
enthusiasm
he
do
when
he
reclaim
the
title
of
ceo
in
well
the
press
be
go
to
do
what
it
s
go
to
do
but
the
truth
be
that
i
be
very
excite
about
the
future
of
the
company
even
if
there
be
some
thread
of
truth
behind
the
critic
claim
and
the
fact
that
the
market
didn
t
like
the
company
have
create
the
opportunity
that
i
be
seize
on
thank
you
market
i
m
grateful
that
you
mispriced
the
company
it
would
ve
be
impossible
to
buy
the
company
back
otherwise
whether
the
market
be
right
or
wrong
it
be
kind
of
a
bittersweet
thing
in
fact
i
be
more
enthusiastic
than
ever
about
the
company
s
prospect
who
i
wonder
have
they
be
talk
to
the
new
york
time
applaud
the
deal
as
a
bold
move
but
go
on
to
call
it
a
huge
gamble
it
will
saddle
dell
with
billion
of
new
debt
and
it
do
nothing
to
divert
the
force
reshape
the
technology
industry
and
undercut
the
company
s
business
that
be
an
interest
take
consider
that
i
d
be
try
to
tell
everybody
who
would
listen
that
far
from
need
to
divert
the
force
reshape
the
technology
industry
dell
be
in
the
process
of
harness
and
command
those
very
force
didn
t
matter
everyone
seem
to
have
an
ax
to
grind
cnn
critic
say
michael
dell
isn
t
much
of
an
innovator
so
he
ll
never
turn
dell
into
the
next
apple
or
samsung
the
press
have
call
me
lot
of
thing
over
the
year
an
enfant
terrible
a
wunderkind
a
genius
an
idiot
whatever
else
i
ve
developed
a
thick
skin
where
name
call
be
concerned
most
of
the
critique
don
t
bother
me
very
much
for
very
long
partly
because
i
know
that
over
time
the
press
have
become
more
interested
in
create
controversy
than
in
present
objective
fact
i
find
most
thing
to
be
overstate
in
either
direction
either
positive
or
negative
and
the
truth
always
closer
to
the
middle
and
funny
i
never
have
the
slightest
desire
to
turn
dell
into
the
next
apple

all
i
really
want
to
do
be
turn
today
s
dell
into
tomorrow
s
dell
and
we
d
already
make
a
pretty
good
start
on
that
but
apparently
our
progress
be
threaten
enough
to
hp
our
big
competitor
at
the
time
that
they
felt
the
need
to
sow
some
good
old
fashion
fud
fear
uncertainty
and
doubt
within
hour
of
the
announcement
they
issue
a
dire
sound
statement
dell
have
a
very
tough
road
ahead
the

face
an
extend
period
of
uncertainty
and
transition
that
will
not
be

for

with

limited

to
leave

at

will
now

us
instead
well
not
if
i
have
anything
to

the
blowback
have
just
begin
on

southeastern

weigh
in
with
a
long
heat

the
letter
widely
quote
in
the
press
call
the
buyout
offer
woefully
inadequate
say
that
it
clearly
represent
an
opportunistically
time
bid
to
take
the
company
private
at
a
valuation
far
below
dell
s
intrinsic
value
and
deprives
public
shareholder
of
the
ability
to
participate
in
the
company
s
substantial
future
value
creation
and
what
be
mason
hawkins
s
idea
of
a
proper
valuation
not
or
or
a
share
not
or
or
even
a

no
southeastern
s
management
contend
that
the
correct
price
for
dell
be
per
share
make
the
company
worth
more
than
billion
how
have
southeastern
come
up
with
that
number
hawkins
thoughtfully
spell
it
out
in
the
letter
he
value
our
pc
business
at
a
share
other
product
line
at
a
combine
per
share
he
calculate
that
the
billion
we
d
spent
on
acquisition
since
come
out
to
per
share
add
them
all
up
and
they
come
to
but
that
figure
have
another
meaning
it
precisely
echoed
our
stock
price
on
the
day
in
and
before
the
great
financial
crisis
when
i
step
back
in
as
ceo
southeastern
be
try
to
get
into
shareholder
head
by
argue
that
in
effect
i
d
driven
the
company
into
the
ground
hawkins
wasn
t
argue
that
i
be
oust
as
ceo
but
he
be
threaten
to
wield
southeastern
s
percent
stake
in
dell
second
only
to
my
percent
to
foment
a
shareholder
mutiny
against
the
deal
his
letter
complain
that
since
southeastern
have
spent
about
billion
to
accumulate
its
million
share
of
dell
it
stood
to
lose
around
million
on
its
dell
holding
if
the
company
sell
at
per
share
i
wasn
t
angry
at
hawkins
i
could
see
where
he
be
come
from
he
be
just
try
to
get
the
best
possible
outcome
for
his
investment
it
be
strange
you
d
have
thought
that
if
southeastern
s
widely
publicize
letter
be
completely
persuasive
dell
stock
would
ve
immediately
jumped
to
plus
a
share
eliminate
the
need
for
a
go
private
that
didn
t
happen
in
fact
on
the
friday
that
the
letter
come
out
dell
share
rise
a
mere
ten
cent
from
to
and
what
the
letter
fail
to
mention
be
that
the
unaffected
price
of
our
stock
its
level
before
all
the
rumor
burst
out
in
mid
january
be
some
three
dollar
low
than
that
our
propose
transaction
offer
the
shareholder
some
of
the
potential
benefit
of
our
plan
without
their
have
to
take
any
of
the
risk
so
instead
of
have
plus
a
share
they
could
get
a
share
and
if
they
didn
t
want
that
they
could
vote
no
on
the
deal
and
their
stock
would
probably
revert
to
odd
a
share
the
choice
seem
pretty
clear
but
discontent
people
rarely
see
clearly
and
our
big
stockholder
s
discontent
have
open
the
door
to
all
kind
of
trouble


trouble
show
up
promptly
the
day
after
the
southeastern
letter
barron
s
ran
a
piece
title
the
dell
deal
may
die
michael
dell
s
deal
to
take
his
namesake
company
private
initially
be
treat
as
a
near
certainty
on
wall
street
it
begin
but
there
s
a
reasonable
chance
that
shareholder
resistance
will
scuttle
the
transaction
the
article
go
on
to
say
that
southeastern
s
opposition
could
galvanize
dell
stockholder
many
of
whom
it
maintain
be
unhappy
with
the
allegedly
low
price
that
i
plan
to
pay
barron

logic
the
per

amount
to
only
eight
time
our
project
profit
of
a

and
just
six
time
earnings
if
you
exclude
our
net
cash
of
billion
which
come
to
a

that
s
a
steal
give
that
dell
be
believe
to
have
earn
a
share
in
its
just
conclude
fiscal
year
that
end
in
january
the
piece
continued
no
major
company
have
ever
go
private
so
cheaply
most
leveraged
buyout
be
do
for
double
the
dell
transaction
valuation
but
if
the
deal
be
such
a
steal
why
wasn
t
the
market
show
anything
different
the
writer
go
on
to
cite
the
bullish
projection
i
d
make
at
our
annual
analyst
day
the
previous
june
our
goal
i
d
say
be
to
generate
billion
in
revenue
and
billion
in
operating
profit
in
fiscal
year
substantial
gain
that
would
be
driven
primarily
by
our
fast
grow
software
and
service
business
give
that
presentation
say
one
investment
manager
quote
in
the
piece
it
s
a
travesty
that
the
dell
board
consider
the
price
to
be
fair
reading
this
i
felt
i
d
step
through
the
look
glass
into
some
kind
of
weird
wonderland
the
very
argument
i
d
be
make
over
the
past
half
year
be
now
be
use
against
me
the
real
travesty
i
d
long
felt
and
continued
to
feel
be
that
investor
be
fail
to
look
beyond
the
clich
of
struggle
pc
manufacturer
and
see
how
great
we
really
be
and
how
much
great
we
be
sure
to
become
it
be
precisely
because
investor
be
refuse
to
be
bullish
on
dell
that
i
be
take
the
bull
by
the
horn


the
first
go

take
place
behind

before
the

knew
we
be
put
the

up
for

kkr
and
tpg
have
drop
in
then
drop
out
the
second
go

be
a
very
different
process
start
with
a
bang
on
the
heel
of
the

that

you
might
ve
miss
this
small
but
interest
aside
it
s
possible
too
that
a
prominent
activist
investor
like
bill
ackman
carl
icahn
or
dan
loeb
could
take
a

in

oppose
the

which
be
slat
to
close
around
midyear

kind
of
a
euphemism
for
what
carl
icahn
really
be
corporate
raider
be
more
to
the
point
and
maybe
trouble
make
opportunist
be
closer
still
to
the
truth
since
the
late
s
icahn
have
show
great
skill
in
gain
significant
position
in
company
in
trouble
or
flux
and
then
either
force
them
to
buy
back
their
stock
at
a
premium
or
push
company
leadership
to
make
decision
that
would
boost
the
share
price
aka
the
value
of
his
holding
he
like
to
present
himself
as
a
great
defender
of
the
common
man
the
ordinary
shareholder
in
fact
he
be
the
great
defender
of
carl
icahn
sometimes
he
would
simply
strip
out
and
sell
a
target
company
s
asset
with
little
concern
for
employee
or
stockholder
but
at
great
financial
gain
to
himself
sometimes
and
this
get
more
and
more
effective
as
his
reputation
and
wealth
grow
all
he
have
to
do
be
threaten
to
take
over
a
company
in
order
to
get
it
to
buy
out
his
share
at
a
big
markup
this
charm
practice
be
know
as
greenmail
he
seem
to
have
little
to

them
before
and
i
wasn

at
the
same
time
i
wasn

very
rapidly

contender
for
an
alternative

and
they
be
make
a
lot
of
noise

now
say
he

percent

list
company
both
say
they
have
letter
from
bank
that

highly
confident
about

but
those
weren
t
commitment
letter
and
we
have
four
bank
formally
commit
to
help
us
still
the
special
committee
say
it
be
prepared
to
negotiate
with
both
icahn
and
blackstone
more
than
that
the
committee
say
publicly
that
it
have
determine
that
the
two
preliminary
plan
submit
by
blackstone
and
icahn
could
result
in
superior
proposal
to
ours
which
be
the
predicate
for
continue
discussion
and
the
medium
be
pay
attention
could
michael
dell
lose
it
all
be
a
question
more
than
one
outlet
ask
rumor
begin
to
surface
that
blackstone
be
consider
replace
me
as
ceo
if
it
won
the
battle
with
silver
lake
and
me
two
possible
successor
kept
get
mention
in
the
news
one
be
mark
hurd
know
as
an
operational
wizard
who
have
formerly
be
ceo
of
hewlett
packard
and
be
currently
president
of
oracle
the
other
be
michael
capella
the
former
ceo
of
compaq
now
on
the
board
of
cisco
and
around
that
time
and
unbeknownst
to
me
chinh
chu
senior
manage
director
of
blackstone
go
with
capella
to
meet
with
jeff
clarke
in
austin
they
come
on
very
strong
full
of
bravado
jeff
remembers
they
told
him
they
be
serious
about
want
to
take
over
dell
but
michael
may
be
out
they
say
and
it
may
be
us
the
way
they
say
it
jeff
recall
didn
t
sound
like
maybe
if
i
be
oust
they
ask
jeff
would
he
want
to
join
them
jeff
wish
them
luck
and
say
he
d
be
honor
to
continue
work
with
me
wherever
i
be
the
talk
about
replace
me
didn
t
feel
great
but
not
as
far
as
my
pride
be
concerned
it
bother
me
because
it
create
uncertainty
i
wonder
how
the
rumor
might
change
the
way
our
employee
and
customer
and
our
partner
and
supplier
would
think
about
their
relationship
with
the
company
which
candidate
be
mention
didn
t
really
matter
i
felt
the
talk
be
just
a
ruse
to
change
the
dynamic
in
a
possible
future
negotiation
with
me
maybe
icahn
and
blackstone
thought
their
scare
tactic
would
somehow
give
them
the
upper
hand
in
a
negotiation
with
me
they
have
read
our
agreement
with
silver
lake
which
say
that
i
be
in
control
of
the
company
and
make
the
key
decision
and
silver
lake
get
to
invest
along
with
me
i
could
see
how
icahn
and
blackstone
might
say
well
we
d
like
to
have
more
say
in
the
matter
and
there
could
ve
be
scenario
where
something
like
that
might
ve
emerge
if
for
example
blackstone
have
say
okay
we
ll
partner
with
you
at
fifteen
dollar
a
share
but
we
want
xyz
governance
right
if
they
be
offering
more
to
the
shareholder
i
would
be
compel
to
find
a
way
to
reach
some
agreement
with
them
that
may
have
be
what
they
be
angle
for
i
never
thought
the
threat
of
replace
me
be
real
i
suspect
most
of
the
suppose
candidate
didn
t
either
perhaps
one
or
two
of
them
bought
it
but
all
that
meant
be
that
they
d
fall
for
the
ruse
in
any
case
the
success
of
the
company
be
and
be
more
important
to
me
than
my
position
in
it
i
ve
always
felt
that
if
someone
could
do
a
well
job
as
leader
i
d
take
on
a
different
role
to
help
the
company
i
do
that
from
to
and
i
be
ready
to
do
it
again
if
the
situation
call
for
it
and
of
course
in
a
public
company
those
decision
be
make
by
the
board
i
also
knew
that
at
our
prior
shareholder
meeting
in
july
of
i
be
reelect
to
serve
as
chairman
and
ceo
with
over
percent
of
the
vote
still
a
lot
have
happen
since
then
on
march
icahn
announce
that
he
be
open
to
join
force
with
blackstone
two
day
later
march
the
wall
street
journal
report
that
blackstone
be
open
to
keep
me
on
as
chief
executive
darn
nice
of
them
i
thought
opening
the
door
to
keep
mr
dell
as
ceo
may
help
the
private
equity
firm
sway
him
to
eventually
side
with
its
bid
the
journal
say
good
luck
with
that
i
thought
i
have
know
steve
schwarzman
blackstone
s
cofounder
for
decade
and
i
have
great
respect
for
him
but
if
side
with
blackstone
s
bid
meant
work
with
the
guy
who
go
behind
my
back
to
jeff
clarke
and
try
to
get
him
to
sell
me
out
thank
you
very
much
but
no
thanks
i
thought
but
for
the
time
be
i
kept
my
thought
to
myself


as
march
turn
to
april
icahn
suddenly
seem
to
be
make
most
of
the
noise
on
the
seventeenth
the
special
committee
announce
that
it
have
make
an
agreement
with
the
billionaire
investor
as
the
medium
like
to
refer
to
him
i
have
my
own
name
for
him
icahn
pledge
not
to
buy
up
by
himself
or
in
league
with
any
other
shareholder
more
than
percent
of
dell
s
stock
in
exchange
the
committee
would
allow
him
to
talk
with
other
major
stockholder
about
join
force
against
silver
lake
and
me
the
agreement
the
special
committee
told
the
press
maximize
the
chance
of
get
the
best
possible
offer
from
icahn
but
also
protect
dell
s
shareholder
from
the
accumulation
of
an
unduly
influential
voting
interest
sound
good
on
paper
but
icahn
wasn
t
exactly
promising
to
behave
either
in
a
statement
he
be
suddenly
make
statement
all
over
the
place
he
say
he
retain
the
right
to
lead
a
shareholder
rebellion
against
dell
s
board
if
the
company
continued
to
favor
silver
lake
and
me
he
also

of

that
make
him
look
like

a
huge
due

meeting
with
them
at
the
marriott
hotel
next
to
our
round
rock

it
be
quite
a
scene
we
need
a
ballroom
to
fit
everybody
they
have
hire
every
consultant
you
could
imagine
there
be
at

fifty
of
their
people
and
twenty
of
ours
at
long
table
with
microphone
every
few
minute
a
moderator
would
announce
the
next
speaker
be
so
and
so
they
grill
us
for
what
felt
like
hour
about
our
finance
our
shipment
our
plan
and
then
they
drop
out
on
april
steve
schwarzman
call
me
himself
sound
regretful
but
matter
of
fact
he
say
that
while
he
have
huge
respect
for
dell
as
a
global
company
and
me
as
its
founder
and
leader
our
recently
release
pc
sale
figure
down
percent
during
the
first
quarter
though
pc
sale
worldwide
fell
percent
in
the
same
period
and
our
decline
operating
income
forecast
down
from
billion
the
previous
july
to
billion
make
a
buyout
just
too
tough
for
blackstone
the
news
go
public
the
next
day
and
our
stock
fell
from
to
the
first
time
since
early
february
that
the
share
price
have
drop
below
the
price
silver
lake
and
i
be
offering
this
also
meant
that
every
share
purchase
include
those
purchase
by
icahn
have
be
bought
at
price
high
than
what
silver
lake
and
i
be
offering
investor
now
seem
to
be
think
that
no
high
bid
would
emerge
now
it
be
just
us
against
icahn
he
be
still
say
loudly
he
love
get
on
tv
that
our
offer
grossly
undervalue
the
company
it
s
really
a
travesty
it
s
almost
like
something
out
of
saturday
night
live
he
told
cnbc
he
be
tell
all
possible
medium
outlet
that
he
have
all
kind
of
plan
to
keep
part
of
dell
public
then
he
announce
he
have
a
new
ally
on
may
his
late
scheme
emerge
icahn
southeastern
asset
management
mount
an
aggressive
challenge
to
dell
buyout
the
headline
read
it
seem
like
an
inevitable
pair
southeastern
with
its
steady
drumbeat
of
disgruntlement
about
the
suppose
paltriness
of
our
offer
and
pirate
carl
the
stockholder
s
friend
together
they
own
percent
of
dell
and
they
of
course
have
big
plan
for
the
company
a
key
component
of
which
be
their
intention
to
oust
me
they
write
a
blistering
letter
to
our
board
accuse
them
of
insult
shareholder
intelligence
by
claim
to
be
focus
on
stockholder
best
interest
while
accept
dell
s
offer
to
buy
the
company
for
far
below
what
we
consider
its
value
to
be
the
letter
go
on
you
not
only
sanction
michael
dell
s
offer
which
amazingly
allows
him
to
purchase
the
company
from
shareholder
with
their
own
money
it
read
but
to
add
insult
to
injury
you
have
agree
to
give
mr
dell
a
breakup
fee
of
up
to
million
this
be
vintage
icahn
do
the
voodoo
that
he
do
so
i
won
t
say
well
but
i
guess
i
could
say
effectively
voice
a
gross
inaccuracy
and
repeat
it
often
enough
and
loudly
enough
and
a
lot
of
people
be
go
to
believe
you
purchasing
the
company
from
shareholder
with
their
own
money
be
just
creative
write
his
way
of
say
he
and
southeastern
felt
our
offer
be
too
low
and
as
for
that
breakup
fee
of
up
to
million
that
be
money
potentially
due
to
silver
lake
not
me
should
the
deal
fall
through
in
favor
of
an
alternative
offer
that
be
make
outside
the
go
shop
period
and
the
potential
breakup
fee
if
the
deal
be
terminate
for
icahn
s
proposal
be
far
low
million
it
s
true
that
i
would
be
out
a
lot
of
money
if
the
deal
fell
through
but
i
have
no
need
whatever
for
a
breakup
fee
silver
lake
on
the
other
hand
would
have
expend
a
great
deal
of
time
and
substantial
resource
on
the
process
and
would
arguably
be
due
appropriate
compensation
but
naturally
we
be
do
everything
in
our
power
to
make
sure
the
deal
would
not
fall
through
and
all
too
naturally
carl
icahn
be
do
everything
in
his
power
to
make
sure
it
would
and
to
make
an
enormous
amount
of
money
if
it
do
icahn
and
southeastern
propose
keep
dell
publicly
trade
and
let
shareholder
keep
their
stake
in
the
company
they
say
they
want
to
give
stockholder
either
per
share
in
cash
or
additional
share
they
want
the
dell
board
to
put
their
proposal
before
the
shareholder
and
if
the
board
say
no
to
that
they
want
dell
s
annual
meeting
when
new
director
would
be
elect
to
also
include
a
vote
on
our
silver
lake
s
and
my
offer
they
intend
to
put
up
their
own
slate
of
director
nominee
at
the
meeting
they
promise
to
work
assiduously
to
convince
their
fellow
shareholder
to
reject
our
bid
this
company
have
suffer
long
enough
from
very
wrongheaded
decision
make
by
the
board
and
its
management
they
write
do
not
make
another
by
put
the
company
through
an
unnecessary
debilitate
proxy
fight
allow
the
shareholder
to
decide
for
themselves
which
offer
they
choose
icahn
told
cnbc
he
be
confident
he
and
southeastern
could
persuade
dell
s
stockholder
to
vote
against
our
proposal
he
say
that
if
his
board
candidate
be
elect
he
could
guarantee
i
would
no
longer
run
the
company
it
s
amaze
what
can
be
do
once
you
do
change
the
leadership
he
say
i
d
face
adversary
in
the
past
but
none
who
would
openly
and
repeatedly
lie
on
national
television
i
be
disgust
by
carl
s
complete
lack
of
moral
fiber
his
appreciation
for
honesty
and
truth
be
basically
nonexistent
he
be
willing
to
do
and
say
anything
to
achieve
his
objective
and
he
s
quite
skilled
with
his
trickery
i
do
believe
that
we
all
perform
well
in
competition
whether
it
s
fair
or
friendly
or
not
though
i
certainly
feel
that
fair
and
friendly
competition
be
well
i
ve
have
plenty
of
competitor
over
the
year
compuadd
ibm
compaq
etc
and
i
think
it
s
good
to
have
an
identify
adversary
to
attack
icahn
make
himself
an
easy
target
he
declare
war
on
us
so
it
be
easy
to
declare
war
back
on
him
and
this
time
as
the
say
go
it
be
personal

young
man
in
a
hurry
i
be
sit
in
the
back
of
an
austin
police
department
cruiser
wear
handcuff
my
crime
go
in
a
mile
per
hour
zone
for
starter
plus
once
the
officer
ran
my
plate
a
big
enough
pile
of
unpaid
speed
ticket
that
a
warrant
have
be
issue
for
my
arrest
the
vehicle
that
have
help
me
earn
all
those
ticket
be
a
red
porsche
a
beautiful
machine
that
i
d
bought
after
the
bmw
have
die
due
to
lack
of
maintenance
turn
out
it
s
a
good
idea
to
put
oil
in
a
car
now
and
then
but
i
be
too
busy
to
pay
attention
to
detail
like
that
i
guess
also
too
busy
to
pay
all
those
speed
ticket
i
d
just
turn
twenty
and
i
be
a
young
man
in
a
hurry
the
be
an
awesome
car
with
incredible
acceleration
but
what
i
d
fail
to
take
into
account
when
i
bought
it
be
that
red
car
be
cop
magnet
especially
if
you
re
speed
which
i
often
be
and
especially
if
you
re
twenty
and
irresponsible
which
i
definitely
be
i
love
drive
fast
and
the
austin
police
love
stop
me
they
always
say
the
same
thing
do
your
daddy
buy
this
car
for
you
son
and
i
always
answer
the
same
way
no
sir
i
apologize
officer
i
didn
t
realize
i
be
drive
so
fast
sir
it
wasn
t
much
of
an
excuse
and
it
never
get
me
off
the
hook
a
single
time
and
now
i
be
pay
for
it
the
cop
take
me
in
to
the
police
station
where
i
get
fingerprint
but
very
fortunately
for
me
be
not
put
in
jail
i
be
so
embarrass
i
knew
i
d
do
the
wrong
thing
i
might
ve
be
a
bit
of
a
rebel
where
my
parent
be
concerned
but
when
it
come
to
military
service
member
police
and
firefighter
i
ve
always
have
nothing
but
respect
and
admiration
for
the
hard
work
they
do
it
be
time
to
pay
up
and
slow
down
plus
buy
a
less
attention
get
car
i
trade
in
the
for
another
porsche
a
black
which
i
also
love
and
try
to
drive
a
little
more
responsibly
year
later
when
i
told
this
story
to
susan
she
say
awesome
so
i
m
married
to
a
gangster
it
be
september
and
dell
computer
corporation
d
b
a
pc
s
limited
be
prosper
we
d
generate
over
million
in
sale
in
our
first
nine
month
of
operation
that
number
would
turn
to
million
at
the
end
of
our
first
full
year
on
january
and
we
be
grow
fast
we
be
still
sell
customize
pc
to
doctor
and
lawyer
and
architect
around
austin
but
thanks
to
national
advertising
in
the
computer
magazine
we
be
also
sell
to
doctor
and
lawyer
and
architect
around
the
country
and
more
we
d
start
to
land
order
from
some
fairly
big
company
like
texaco
ford
monsanto
and
many
others
we
d
go
far
beyond
write
up
order
by
hand
and
put
them
on
clothesline
now
i
could
afford
to
hire
a
guy
to
create
an
order
entry
system
that
our
salesperson
could
use
on
their
pc
do
i
mention
that
our
salesperson
now
have
pc
the
only
hitch
be
that
our
company
computer
weren
t
networked
so
at
the
end
of
every
day
each
of
the
salesperson
would
give
me
a
floppy
disk
contain
the
order
he
or
she
have
take
that
day
i
would
then
load
each
of
these
into
our
order
database
it
be
all
just
a
little
bit
make
it
up
as
you
go
along
maybe
more
than
a
little
bit
do
we
know
what
we
be
do
yes
and
no
my
entrepreneurial
boyhood
notwithstanding
i
have
never
run
a
business
before
so
there
be
that
learn
curve
to
climb
but
it
wasn
t
just
learn
to
run
a
business
it
be
learn
to
run
a
business
that
wasn
t
like
other
business
even
though
on
the
surface
pc
s
limited
look
like
many
other
computer
business
the
mid
to
late
s
be
a
boom
time
for
start
ups
in
our
sector
there
be
a
monthly
magazine
back
then
call
computer
shopper
it
grow
to
hundred
of
page
over
the
course
of
the
decade
roughly
half
of
it
editorial
content
and
tech
article
and
the
rest
advertisement
from
literally
hundred
of
new
company
that
if
you
squint
your
eye
all
look
pretty
similar
we
be
one
of
them
and
yet
of
all
the
many
company
try
to
imitate
us
by
make
build
to
order
pc
and
get
them
out
the
same
day
plus
offering
free
technical
support
by
phone
we
be
the
only
one
that
thrive
and
succeed
we
didn
t
start
building
to
the
customer
s
order
because
we
saw
some
massive
paradigm
in
the
future
we
start
that
way
because
we
didn
t
have
the
capital
to
mass
produce
it
turn
out
to
be
a
pretty
lucky
handicap
and
many
of
the
big
lesson
we
learn
in
the
company
s
formative
year
come
about
in
the
same
seat
of
the
pant
way
we
experiment
and
improvised
our
way
to
success
pc
s
limited
be
like
a
rocket
ship
hurtle
skyward
but
with
a
wobble
in
the
trajectory
our
development
be
uneven
on
the
one
hand
we
have
this
light
out

chaos
that
be
our
headquarters
with
the
engineer
upgrade

as
fast
as

do
their

be
the
high
praise
he
could
have
give
me


we
be
do
very
well
by
improve
ibm
s
product
and
undercut
them
on
price
way
undercut
them
in
june
of
that
year
we
d
introduce
our
first
name
brand
computer
the
turbo
pc
with
an
intel
cpu
k
of
ram
and
a
k
floppy
drive
it
sell
by
mail
order
or
phone
order
only
for
a
similarly
configure
ibm
pc
retail
in
store
only
for
between
and
compaq
s
version
would
set
you
back
at
least
when
i
first
told
kelley
guest
about
the
turbo
pc
its
specification
and
its
price
point
he
say
michael
if
you
can
do
that
one
day
you
re
go
to
own
the
world
well
we
didn
t
own
the
world
yet
but
we
be
sure
sell
a
ton
of
those
turbo
pc
even
so
though
i
have
my
eye
set
on
big
thing
the
previous
year
ibm
have
introduce
the
pc
at
with
an
operating
system
base
on
the
intel
microprocessor
one
day
while
i
be
leaf
through
one
of
my
favorite
tech
magazine
ee
time
electrical
engineering
time
i
saw
a
story
about
a
company
call
chip
and
technology
that
have
design
a
series
of
five
asic
chip
application
specific
integrate
circuit
that
could
be
use
to
build
an
intel
base
microcomputer
compatible
with
ibm
s
pc
at
i
thought
man
i
ve
get
to
get
me
some
of
those
right
now
chip
and
technology
be
run
by
a
guy
name
gordon
campbell
so
i
call
him
up
hey
i
heard
what
you
guy
be
do
i
say
i
m
really
interested
how
do
i
get
some
of
these
chipsets
campbell
say
he
d
be
glad
to
sell
me
three
do
you
have
a
reference
design
i
ask
typically
when
a
company
have
a
chip
that
they
want
to
sell
you
or
in
this
case
a
set
of
chip
they
ll
give
you
a
reference
schematic
that
tell
you
how
you
connect
the
chip
with
the
microprocessor
with
the
memory
chip
with
all
the
other
chip
you
need
to
connect
them
to
in
order
to
make
a
compatible
computer
i
sent
campbell
a
check
and
get
the
chipsets
and
the
reference
design
in
the
mail
i
take
one
chipset
out
and
put
it
on
my
desk
alongside
the
schematic
i
look
at
the
chipset
i
look
at
the
schematic
i
thought
what
the
heck
do
i
do
now
i
have
hit
the
limit
of
my
technological
expertise
i
phone
my
intel
salesperson
i
want
to
design
a
compatible
computer
and
i
need
an
engineer
do
you
know
any
good
one
he
start
rattle
off
name
okay
this
guy
over
at
texas
instrument
these
guy
over
at
compaq
ibm
data
general
motorola
as
i
grabbed
a
pencil
and
paper
and
start
furiously
write
them
down
there
be
a
dozen
in
all
and
i
contact
every
one
of
them
some
of
them
didn
t
want
to
meet
with
me
some
of
them
met
with
me
but
didn
t
want
to
do
it
but
one
of
them
a
guy
name
jay
bell
be
different
from
all
the
rest
jay
be
a
singular
man
tall
and
gaunt
with
a
brushy
mustache
and
a
pierce
gaze
behind
thick
lensed
glass
he
talk
fast
and
thought
fast
he
be
fizz
with
energy
and
idea
and
confidence
he
d
design
some
microprocessor
base
computer
system
for
xerox
that
have
work
out
very
well
and
he
wasn
t
shy
about
say
so
when
i
show
him
the
chipset
and
the
schematic
he
quickly
say
oh
yeah
that
s
easy
i
could
build
you
a
prototype
in
a
week
or
two
i
give
him
a
funny
look
really
a
week
or
two
how
be
you
go
to
do
that
what
s
this
go
to
cost
me
i
ask
he
thought
for
a
second
i
can
wire
up
a
motherboard
and
give
you
a
prototype
for
a
thousand
dollar
he
say
that
take
me
by
surprise
i
would
ve
thought
he
d
ask
for
a
lot
more
tell
you
what
i
say
i
m
go
out
of
town
for
a
couple
of
week
i
ll
give
you
a
thousand
now
when
i
come
back
if
you
ve
get
a
work
prototype
i
ll
give
you
another
thousand
meanwhile
i
be
think
i
don
t
really
know
if
this
guy
can
do
this
or
not
but
it
s
only
a
thousand
buck
and
he
s
have
enough
success
with
small
computer
system
design
that
maybe
he
s
not
bullshitting
me
and
probably
the
prospect
of
get
another
thousand
dollar
be
enough
to
motivate
him
to
finish
the
job
i
didn
t
think
he
be
just
go
to
take
my
money
and
vanish
so
we
shook
on
it


i
be
actually
leave
town
for
three
week
it
be
a
long
time
to
be
away
from
the
helm
of
my
ship
but
i
have
important
business
to
do
our
own
little
corner
of
the
computer
market
be
do
well
but
to
keep
grow
quickly
we
need
to
establish
direct
relationship
with
the
supplier
for
all
the
principal
component
any
economy
we
could
find
would
insulate
us
from
trouble
and
i
knew
the
supply
chain
for
the
part
we
be
order
be
full
of
markup
that
i
could
radically
reduce
if
i
go
straight
to
the
source
my
lightbulb
moment
have
come
when
i
examine
some
of
the
print
circuit
board
we
be
buying
every
one
of
them
i
found
have
a
tiny
copy
of
the
manufacturer
s
logo
on
the
underside
only
we
weren
t
purchasing
them
from
the
manufacturer
i
be
tire
of
deal
with
distributor
and
dealer
and
middleman
and
agent
i
want
to
go
to
the
factory
where
these
thing
be
make
and
almost
all
of
them
along
with
the
factory
that
make
practically
every
other
part
we
be
buying
be
in
the
far
east
i
d
found
out
that
every
fall
there
be
a
kind
of
circuit
of
electronics
show
in
taiwan
japan
korea
and
hong
kong
so
i
get
on
a
plane
and
flew
out
there
i
be
twenty
year
old
full
of
energy
and
curiosity
with
no
string
tie
me
to
austin
except
the
business
and
with
the
momentum
we
have
i
be
confident
that
my
department
head
could
hold
down
the
fort
while
i
be
go
i
could
call
every
few
day
to
check
in
i
be
excite
my
god
i
be
excite
there
be
a
whole
new
world
out
there
just
wait
for
me
to
discover
it
i
d
be
overseas
just
once
when
we
visit
steven
in
london
this
be
way
overseas
i
love
the
whole
trip
i
love
wheel
and
deal
at
the
show
in
taipei
and
hong
kong
and
tokyo
and
osaka
and
seoul
talk
to
the
people
from
samsung
and
kyocera
and
sharp
and
sanyo
and
sony
and
panasonic
hand
out
and
collect
business
card
make
friend
when
i
ask
about
the
hundred
thousand
unit
price
and
the
million
unit
price
and
say
send
me
a
sample
see
people
s
eye
light
up
when
i
told
them
about
my
business
i
love
how
at
my
hotel
in
seoul
there
be
only
three
thing
on
the
din
room
menu
kimchi
kimchi
and
kimchi
this
be
truly
a
different
part
of
the
world
really
be
in
the
far
east
and
discover
the
inner
working
of
how
the
whole
supply
chain
world
work
where
i
d
only
see
part
of
it
before
be
like
peel
an
onion
and
go
all
the
way
to
the
center
ever
since
i
be
thirteen
i
d
be
take
computer
apart
and
examine
the
piece
inside
now
i
be
actually
visit
the
plant
where
these
thing
be
be
make
i
be
wear
protective
bunny
suit
and
walk
around
factory
floor
with
the
guy
who
ran
the
factory
and
they
be
show
me
their
whole
process
i
couldn
t
possibly
have
gotten
any
closer
to
the
action
some
factory
be
much
more
focus
on
worker
safety
than
others
and
that
concerned
me
one
taiwanese
plant
i
go
to
have
an
open
gutter
with
chemical
run
right
through
the
middle
of
the
concrete
factory
floor
that
s
not
a
good
idea
i
thought
at
dell
we
have
a
simple
philosophy
one
we
still
have
today
no
one
should
ever
get
hurt
work
at
dell
i
be
learn
every
minute
i
be
see
how
the
taiwan
and
hong
kong
supplier
could
wheel
and
deal
with
the
best
of
them
but
the
japanese
be
a
little
more
formal
and
protocol
bound
i
be
talk
about
how
many
power
supply
or
monitor
or
keyboard
you
could
put
in
a
or
foot
shipping
container
then
calculate
how
often
i
d
need
to
have
a
container
full
of
these
thing
ship
over
and
what
would
be
the
unit
cost
to
ship
each
one
and
could
i
get
the
supplier
to
give
me
term
or
would
i
have
to
post
a
letter
of
credit
and
every
moment
i
be
calculate
the
possibility
because
the
difference
between
the
cost
of
the
component
at
the
source
and
the
cost
back
in
the
state
at
the
end
of
the
supply
chain
be
enormous
by
the
time
i
flew
back
home
it
felt
like
i
d
jumped
ahead
several
level
in
the
game
i
have
commitment
from
many
new
supplier
to
ship
to
us
direct
save
us
million
in
product
cost
it
be
a
big
leg
up
on
our
competition
and
it
be
an
advantage
we
sorely
need
because
there
be
a
lot
of
competition


i
return
to
find
jay
bell
still
hard
at
work
on
our
prototype
but
he
say
close
to
a
solution
it
turn
out
that
the
schematic
that
chip
and
technology
have
provide
have
all
kind
of
error
in
it
and
the
only
way
to
find
the
error
be
to
wire
it
all
up
and
correct
the
circuit
one
by
one
jay
be
in
the
process
of
write
by
hand
exactly
how
to
make
the
thing
work
and
it
be
an
extremely
laborious
process
jay
have
be
work
from
home
but
i
want
him
nearby
when
he
finally
succeed
and
i
knew
he
be
go
to
succeed
so
i
instal
him
in
a
kind
of
secret
office
in
our
building
no
one
knew
he
be
there
there
be
no
name
on
the
door
and
make
him
promise
not
to
speak
with
any
pc
s
limited
team
member
it
be
crucial
to
keep
the
project
under
wrap
until
we
be
ready
to
go
public
with
it
the
well
i
get
to
know
jay
the
stranger
i
found
him
i
think
he
might
ve
be
manic
depressive
he
would
get
these
huge
burst
of
energy
and
work
for
thirty
six
or
forty
eight
or
seventy
two
hour
straight
then
crash
daytime
or
nighttime
meant
nothing
to
him
one
time
soon
after
i
get
back
from
asia
my
phone
startle
me
out
of
a
sound
sleep
it
be
three
in
the
morning
and
it
be
my
old
friend
the
austin
police
department
on
the
line
sir
it
appear
that
somebody
have
broken
into
your
building
the
officer
say
well
that
s
not
very
good
i
say
i
ll
be
right
over
i
pull
into
the
parking
lot
to
find
a
totally
surreal
scene
illuminate
by
the
flash
red
and
blue
light
of
several
police
cruiser
jay
be
inside
the
building
hold
his
driver
s
license
up
to
the
window
of
the
employee
lunchroom
while
a
half
dozen
cop
stood
outside
with
their
gun
drawn
it
s
all
right
officer
i
know
him
i
say
it
s
totally
fine
don
t
worry
everything
be
go
to
be
fine
it
turn
out
jay
have
just
be
work
after
hour
and
open
some
door
that
trigger
an
alarm
in
the
meantime
though
i
want
to
throw
every
possible
resource
into
the
project
i
hire
a
group
of
indian
engineer
with
both
hardware
and
software
expertise
to
consult
with
jay
they
have
be
work
on
a
mhz
processor
speed
computer
system
they
be
also
say
to
have
an
at
compatible
bios
i
want
to
look
into
buying
that
from
them
i
picked
these
guy
up
at
the
austin
airport
myself
there
be
five
of
them
but
only
one
his
name
be
subramonian
shankar
could
speak
much
english
they
hadn
t
be
in
the
state
long
and
everything
they
saw
still
amaze
them
i
instal
them
in
a
garden
apartment
complex
that
be
just
across
the
street
from
our
headquarters
three
guy
in
one
apartment
and
two
in
another
right
next
door
i
eventually
convince
the
apartment
manager
to
tear
down
a
wall
so
it
could
just
be
one
big
apartment
the
engineer
both
work
and
live
there
none
of
them
drove
so
once
a
week
i
would
take
them
to
the
heb
supermarket
to
stock
up
on
food
the
first
time
they
walk
into
heb
their
jaw
drop
they
d
never
see
anything
like
the
insane
bounty
of
an
american
grocery
store
the
indian
engineer
get
right
to
work
on
a
review
of
the
chip
and
technology
chipset
s
capability
at
cpu
speed
of
mhz
and
mhz
now
and
then
i
d
drop
by
their
apartment
to
see
how
the
work
be
go
and
i
be
struck
by
two
thing
first
the
overpower
smell
of
curry
and
second
the
fact
that
these
guy
smart
and
hardworking
as
they
be
would
drop
everything
to
watch
wrestling
whenever
it
come
on
tv
they
be
just
obsess
with
wrestling
by
early
december
jay
have
a
partially
work
prototype
and
in
mid
january
after
hundred
of
hour
of
work
both
alone
and
in
collaboration
with
the
indian
engineer
he
d
confirm
the
design
we
found
an
austin
company
that
design
circuit
board
and
hire
their
best
board
router
a
middle
age
woman
who
smoke
like
a
chimney
while
she
work
i
brave
the
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
to
lean
over
her
shoulder
and
watch
with
fascination
while
she
create
a
circuit
board
layout
design
the
optimal
rout
of
the
circuit
one
that
us
the
minimal
amount
of
space
on
the
board
yet
doesn
t
juxtapose
circuit
that
could
create
electronic
interference
if
place
too
close
together
be
a
process
that
combine
art
and
science
but
she
do
it
and
that
circuit
board
become
the
basis
of
the
computer
that
we
introduce
in
march
which
be
an
instant
hit
in
quick
succession
we
roll
out
three
new
pc
a
low
cost
computer
operating
at
mhz
a
mhz
machine
that
be
faster
than
any
other
ibm
at
compatible
on
the
market
and
a
mhz
version
that
eclipse
all
competitor
include
compaq
and
ibm
in
short
order
we
would
introduce
a
mhz
machine
that
would
rock
the
personal
computer
world
if
you
ve
ever
daydream
about
climb
into
the
computer
equivalent
of
an
f
jet
punch
the
throttle
and
blasting
straight
up
into
the
cloud
sit
yourself
down
in
front
of
one
of
these
pc
magazine
would
write
breathlessly
after
a
few
hour
at
mhz
a
lumber
ibm
at
feel
like
a
dusty
relic
from
a
computer
museum
our
ramshackle
little
company
be
poise
to
rule
the
personal
computer
world
that
spring
it
be
super
excite
we
be
grow
much
faster
than
the
industry
even
though
we
be
really
small
at
the
time
pc
be
just
become
a
big
deal
tech
people
engineer
and
hobbyist
rather
than
the
general
public
be
buying
them
i
remember
my
mom
come
to
a
comdex
show
in
atlanta
where
we
demonstrate
our
new
mhz
computer
she
be
proud
to
see
what
her
son
be
do
as
crazy
as
it
seem
though
our
hot
little
company
be
also
in
big
trouble


two
major
factor
be
work
against
us
the
first
be
financial
and
it
be
grave
despite
the
new
business
relationship
i
d
forge

we
be
look
at

for
the
current

year
our
finance
weren

almost
all
the

right
into

and
part
and
our
bank
credit
in
austin
be
stretch
very
thin
in
reality
far
thinner
than
i
knew
the
state
of
texas
be
in
the
midst
of
a
severe
recession
that
spring
and
the

we

do
and
there
appear
to
be
no
prospect
of
increase
the
line
in
fact
unbeknownst
to
me
mbank
be
seriously
consider
closing
my
account
because
unbeknownst
to
almost
everyone
in
austin
mbank
itself
be
in
dire
financial
strait
and
that
be
just
the
begin
of
our
bad
news
the
big
hammer
that
come
down
on
us
that
spring
come
courtesy
of
the
federal
communication
commission
personal
computer
it
seem
emit
radio
frequency
interference
unless
they
be
properly
shield
which
many
pc
clone
be
not
and
so
the
fcc
have
begin
a
crackdown
on
personal
computer
manufacturer
as
we
found
out
courtesy
of
a
cease
and
desist
letter
we
receive
in
april
it
have
come
to
our
attention
it
say
that
you
re
building
these
device
and
you
don
t
have
the
require
class
b
fcc
approval
we
be
to
cease
manufacturing
operation
immediately
the
letter
say
we
be
also
order
to
pay
nearly
in
fine
for
me
this
come
straight
out
of
left
field
what
the
heck
be
the
fcc
at
twenty
one
i
didn
t
know
the
fcc
from
the
dmv
i
phone
kelley
guest
kelley
turn
out
to
be
good
luck
for
us
and
not
for
the
first
or
last
time
it
seem
he
be
friend
with
a
guy
name
dick
wiley
who
have
be
chairman
of
the
fcc
in
the
s
after
leave
the
commission
wiley
have
go
into
the
consumer
advocacy
business
fight
against
overregulation
so
we
hire
dick
wiley
who
go
to
the
fcc
and
essentially
say
hey
these
be
a
bunch
of
kid
they
re
try
to
do
the
right
thing
we
try
because
there
be
no
other
choice
every
day
for
two
week
that
april
and
may
with
no
product
go
out
and
ever
diminish
revenue
trickle
in
we
jay
bell
a
couple
of
our
other
engineer
and
i
go
to
a
test
range
own
by
a
lab
in
san
antonio
to
try
and
engineer
one
of
our
machine
into
compliance
every
day
we
played
around
with
different
configuration
of
component
to
try
and
get
the
emission
profile
to
a
point
where
it
would
repeatedly
pas
the
fcc
s
test
and
every
night
as
i
put
my
head
down
on
the
pillow
with
our
business
stop
in
its
track
i
thought
about
all
the
people
who
work
at
the
company
some
of
them
with
family
people
whose
livelihood
i
be
responsible
for
we
solve
the
emission
profile
inside
of
two
week
and
it
be
a
lucky
thing
we
do
if
it
have
take
much
longer
pc
s
limited
would
have
be
pc
s
terminate


the
company
be
double
in
size
every
year
that
in
itself
be
amaze
and
highly
unusual
it
be
do
very
well
as
far
as
young
start
ups
go
but
i
knew
we
need
help
we
be
outgrow
everything
our
building
phone
system
order
management
system
supplier
banking
relationship
nothing
could
keep
up
with
our
meteoric
growth
in
a
certain
way
i
couldn
t
either
in
the
few
hour
when
i
wasn
t
work
i
be
devour
book
about
leadership
and
management
learn
about
all
the
thing
i
didn
t
know
i
be
twenty
one
a
curious
and
ambitious
twenty
one
to
be
sure
but
there
be
a
lot
i
didn
t
know
to
date
i
d
try
to
hire
the
best
people
i
could
people
who
could
help
the
company
grow
people
who
knew
more
about
their
area
of
expertise
than
i
do
otherwise
why
hire
them
i
do
make
some
hire
mistake
but
i
be
pretty
fast
to
correct
them
and
move
on
but
it
be
now
dawn
on
me
that
the
big
mistake
i
d
make
wasn
t
someone
i
d
hire
but
someone
i
hadn
t
hire
yet
to
a
great
degree
i
be
fly
solo
at
pc
s
limited
i
be
chairman
and
ceo
and
own
percent
of
the
stock
of
the
company
which
be
unusual
there
be
no
other
founder
and
unlike
at
compaq
mile
down
the
road
in
houston
no
venture
capitalist
or
board
of
director
i
have
this
layer
of
vice
president
of
key
department
but
it
now
struck
me
that
the
management
structure
of
pc
s
limited
be
miss
a
crucial
piece
at
the
top
i
need
someone
with
the
kind
of
experience
run
a
company
that
i
didn
t
have
several
people
around
austin
have
mention
the
name
lee
walker
to
me
the
consensus
seem
to
be
that
he
be
a
special
and
unusual
guy
someone
who
d
do
a
lot
and
knew
a
lot
that
be
about
all
i
knew
remember
this
be
year
before
the
internet
you
couldn
t
just
google
someone
so
when
an
acquaintance
of
mine
name
jim
seymour
say
he
could
put
together
a
dinner
with
walker
plus
a
guy
i
be
think
about
hire
as
my
president
a
timex
executive
my
curiosity
be
pique
seymour
be
an
interest
guy
himself
a
supersmart
and
thoughtful
early
commentator
on
the
personal
computer
industry
who
just
happen
to
live
in
austin
he
d
establish
himself
as
kind
of
a
guru
write
column
and
review
new
product
for
pc
magazine
and
pc
week
he
could
be
caustic
but
so
far
he
d
be
friendly
to
me
and
the
company
he
also
happen
to
be
the
big
man
i
ve
ever
see
he
must
have
weigh
four
hundred
pound
jim
told
me
that
lee
have
played
basketball
and
major
in
physic
at
texas
a
m
already
an
unusual
combination
and
to
pile
on
the
incongruity
be
fluent
in
russian
and
have
an
mba
from
harvard
business
school
he
d
go
to
work
for
union
carbide
but
found
early
on
that
the
corporate
life
wasn
t
for
him
and
he
instead
turn
himself
into
a
very
successful
entrepreneur
he
have
a
shorten
company
in
chicago
he
have
a
nuclear
metallurgical
laboratory
that
make
americium
dioxide
pellet
for
smoke
detector
he
have
a
specialty
valve
company
and
a
medical
product
company
and
now
at
age
forty
five
he
be
tap
the
brake
a
little
about
to
spend
the
summer
in
the
south
of
france
maybe
seymour
say
i
could
catch
him
before
he
left
retain
him
as
a
temporary
adviser
lee
sure
knew
a
lot
seymour
say
and
jim
wasn
t
one
to
throw
around
compliment
idly
the
four
of
us
met
one
may
even
at
a
chinese
restaurant
call
beijing
imperium
and
the
first
thing
i
notice
be
that
lee
walker
be
huge
himself
vertically
he
stood
six
foot
nine
it
turn
out
he
d
played
center
for
the
aggies
and
it
far
turn
out
that
that
be
far
from
the
most
interest
thing
about
him
it
be
an
odd
even
three
guy
in
their
forty
and
me
i
remember
do
a
lot
more
listen
than
talk
i
also
remember
walker
go
on
and
on
about
some
brooklyn
dodger
i
knew
about
vaguely
from
my
baseball
card
trading
day
carl
furillo
we
didn
t
get
around
to
much
in
the
way
of
business
talk
but
in
an
off
the
wall
way
that
also
felt
instinctive
lee
walker
impressed
me
far
more
than
the
guy
from
timex
that
guy
seem
like
a
corporate
functionary
and
not
much
more
walker
on
the
other
hand
seem
like
much
more
his
kind
nature
and
intelligence
struck
me
immediately
he
be
authoritative
but
warm
articulate
but
quirky
he
certainly
didn
t
seem
to
be
look
for
a
job
i
like
him
which
also
meant
that
i
felt
in
my
gut
that
i
could
trust
him
and
for
all
my
business
reading
it
be
clear
he
knew
a
ton
more
about
business
than
i
do


a
couple
of
day
later
i
take
a
chance
and
drove
up
to
lee
walker
s
house
on
cat
mountain
in
the
hill
northwest
of
austin
i
hadn
t
call
first
it
be
a
drop
in
pure
and
simple
not
something
you
d
do
with
just
anybody
but
i
figure
that
if
i
d
read
walker
correctly
he
be
the
kind
of
guy
that
wouldn
t
mind
he
didn
t
he
look
a
little
surprised
when
he
open
his
front
door
but
then
he
smile
and
ask
me
in
he
be
just
have
lunch
he
say
be
i
hungry
we
sat
down
over
tomato
soup
and
tuna
sandwich
at
his
kitchen
table
and
i
get
straight
to
the
point
would
you
like
to
be
president
of
my
company
i
ask
him
he
smile
again
and
shook
his
head
i
m
head
to
france
in
a
week
he
say
i
ll
be
there
all
summer
maybe
longer
we
ate
in
silence
for
a
little
while
then
he
say
why
don
t
you
tell
me
about
your
company
how
d
you
get
start
i
told
him
everything
i
ve
told
you
about
how
i
get
into
business
go
way
back
to
my
family
s
fascination
with
finance
and
market
my
early
foray
into
entrepreneurship
trading
stamp
at
stamp
show
and
then
by
catalogue
hit
it
big
sell
subscription
all
against
a
background
of
my
passion
for
computer
he
be
easy
to
talk
to
because
i
felt
he
be
really
listen
to
everything
i
be
say
processing
it
on
some
deep
level
let
s
take
a
walk
he
say
we
go
outside
and
lee
lead
us
down
a
trail
through
the
wood
and
because
i
felt
he
be
really
interested
in
what
i
be
say
i
kept
talk
i
told
him
about
take
apart
the
apple
ii
and
move
on
to
upgrade
ibm
pc
about
start
a
little
business
sell
them
which
turn
into
a
not
so
little
business
he
laugh
when
i
told
him
about
my
pc
arbitrage
day
and
the
fly
and
buy
and
then
i
be
off
to
austin
and
ut
the
apartment
with
my
friend
and
hiding
all
the
computer
part
in
david
s
bathtub
when
my
parent
come
to
visit
it
be
funny
as
i
recall
how
disappointed
and
angry
my
mom
and
dad
have
be
when
i
told
them
i
be
give
up
college
and
a
future
as
a
doctor
to
work
on
this
crazy
start
up
all
those
emotion
come
back
to
me
a
whole
mixture
of
sadness
and
pride
and
defiance
and
love
for
my
parent
as
upset
with
me
as
they
be
i
knew
i
have
it
in
me
to
make
them
proud
and
then
on
to
north
lamar
and
then
headway
circle
and
building
my
scrappy
little
company
new
hire
by
new
hire
one
a
week
to
where
we
be
today
he
nod
as
he
listen
and
his
brief
but
thoughtful
response
make
me
realize
that
this
be
the
first
person
i
d
ever
encounter
who
could
understand
the
business
really
understand
it
at
an
intellectual
level
he
get
it
he
instantly
grasped
our
supply
chain
advantage
and
disadvantage
our
entire
business
model
i
felt
so
strongly
that
we
could
succeed
where
others
be
fail
i
told
lee
i
just
need
help
from
someone
who
knew
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
didn
t
know
i
need
to
be
able
to
delegate
those
thing
to
that
someone
while
i
focus
on
create
new
product
and
grow
customer
relationship
and
keep
the
growth
go
we
could
divide
and
conquer
i
say
the
trail
have
circle
back
around
to
his
driveway
as
we
come
out
of
the
wood
lee
smile
a
little
sadly
and
shook
my
hand
you
re
an
extraordinarily
impressive
young
man
he
say
but
i
can
t
help
you
i
m
sorry

the
end
be
nigh
for
all
its
sound
and
fury
the
icahn
southeastern
proposal
have
a
logical
flaw
at
its
center
icahn
kept
claim
that
because
my
transformation
strategy
for
the
company
be
work
dell
be
worth
far
more
than
silver
lake
and
i
be
offering
but
he
be
also
say
the
company
s
leadership
need
to
be
replace
in
effect
he
be
praise
me
and
threaten
to
oust
me
at
the
same
time
but
i
didn
t
think
he
want
to
take
over
the
company
at
all
i
thought
he
be
just
pull
some
warm
over
greenmail
technique
out
of
his
playbook
to
try
to
pressure
us
into
sweeten
our
offer
and
make
carl
icahn
richer
and
there
be
those
who
agree
with
me
on
may
under
the
headline
why
michael
dell
still
win
the
wall
street
journal
s
holman
jenkins
write
mr
icahn
threatens
a
proxy
war
if
dell
doesn
t
adapt
his
leverage
up
strategy
but
he
won
t
bid
for
the
company
so
he
can
put
his
strategy
into
effect
himself
he
doesn
t
want
the
risk
he
just
want
mr
dell
to
pay
more
for
the
risk
which
mr
dell
have
refuse
with
considerable
cold
bloodedness
to
do
the
end
be
nigh
not
nigh
enough
as
it
turn
out


on
may
the
special
committee
write
icahn
a
letter
ask
him
to
explain
his
plan
in
more
detail
and
for
the
next
week
he
kept
pop
up
all
over
cnbc
and
bloomberg
news
and
in
any
financial
journal
that
want
to
talk
with
him
and
they
all
want
to
talk
with
him
he
be
great
copy
a
rating
magnet
again
and
again
he
trot
out
the
same
message
dell
shareholder
should
get
a
bonus
the
company
should
stay
public
leadership
should
be
replace
this
be
not
the
kind
of
explanation
the
special
committee
be
look
for
so
on
may
they
write
to
icahn
again
tell
him
that
they
wouldn
t
talk
to
him
unless
he
present
a
superior
proposal
to
ours
unless
we
receive
information
that
be
responsive
to
our
may
letter
we
be
not
in
a
position
to
evaluate
whether
your
proposal
meet
that
standard
the
committee
told
him
and
it
be
not
clear
to
us
whether
you
intend
to
formulate
your
transaction
as
an
actual
acquisition
proposal
that
the
board
could
evaluate
i
be
pretty
sure
i
knew
why
it
wasn
t
clear
icahn
have
no
plan
for
dell
icahn
be
just
try
to
make
his
share
more
valuable
by
any
mean
necessary
right
around
then
i
get
a
crazy
idea
why
not
just
ask
him
about
it
face
to
face
we
d
never
met
but
we
d
spoken
once
about
five
year
earlier
when
he
call
out
of
the
blue
to
ask
me
a
few
question
about
motorola
where
he
be
about
to
get
into
his
late
proxy
battle
i
didn
t
really
remember
the
conversation
but
i
do
remember
the
battle
it
be
messy
icahn
bought
a
ton
of
share
and
get
a
few
people
onto
the
company
s
board
then
lose
a
load
of
money
when
motorola
stock
tanked
do
he
care
about
motorola
as
a
company
nope
to
icahn
the
whole
thing
be
just
a
poker
game
he
be
a
gambler
and
gambler
know
they
have
to
fold
em
now
and
then
i
just
want
to
ask
him
what
make
him
think
he
be
go
to
win
with
me
at
first
it
be
just
a
vague
notion
but
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
intrigue
it
seem
why
not
ask
him
in
person

open
you
re
what
she

it
be
a
beautiful
spring
even
in
manhattan
so

decide
to
walk
from
the
hotel
over
to
icahn
s
place
in
the
west
fifty
not
just
because
it
be
lovely
out
but
because
i
didn
t
want
my
driver
or
anybody
to
know
where
i
be
go
as
strange
as
it
seem
there
could
have
be
considerable
corporate
or
financial
ramification
if
i
be
spot
din
with
the
enemy
the
whole
thing
be
funny
and
serious
at
the
same
time
i
couldn
t
help
think
of
one
of
my
favorite
movie
character
peter
seller
s
inspector
clouseau
as
i
popped
on
my
sunglass
and
stroll
across
town
to
icahn
s
apartment
tower
i
didn
t
know
what
to
expect
when
i
rang
his
doorbell
but
when
the
door
open
i
saw
an
old
man
with
a
sparse
gray
beard
and
stoop
shoulder
wear
a
sport
coat
and
press
trouser
he
smile
as
we
shook
hand
then
shuffle
a
little
lead
me
across
his
apartment
pause
for
a
moment
at
the
kitchen
doorway
to
introduce
me
to
his
wife
gail
who
be
indeed
cooking
whatever
it
be
smell
ok
enough
she
give
me
a
friendly
hello
then
carl
lead
me
out
to
a
terrace
with
a
view
westward
to
the
hudson
river
we
sat
down
and
he
offer
me
a
glass
of
wine
i
m
good
i
say
he
shrug
and
pour
himself
a
glass
of
wine
nice
view
i
say
he
smile
as
he
sip
his
wine
best
in
the
city
he
say
small
talk
be
fine
for
me
we
ll
get
down
to
the
nitty
gritty
soon
enough
i
thought
first
though
come
his
life
story
we
be
now
seat
across
from
each
other
at
his
din
room
table
eat
our
salad
mr
icahn
be
still
busy
in
the
kitchen
carl
seem
very
proud
about
have
grown
up
in
far
rockaway
a
middle
class
neighborhood
in
queen
and
go
to
public
school
i
don
t
come
from
money
he
told
me
in
his
strong
new
york
accent
his
father
he
say
have
aspire
to
be
an
opera
singer
but
wound
up
be
a
cantor
at
their
temple
which
be
ironic
carl
say
because
he
be
an
atheist
carl
s
father
seem
to
loom
large
in
his
life
and
not
in
a
good
way
it
be
clear
from
what
carl
say
that
his
dad
hadn
t
treat
him
well
that
he
never
felt
good
enough
for
his
father
when
it
come
time
for
young
carl
to
go
to
college
he
be
accepted
to
princeton
a
big
coup
for
a
jew
in
the
mid
s
when
there
be
still
restriction
at
some
of
the
ivy
league
school
but
his
father
say
why
don
t
you
go
to
city
college
you
ll
be
closer
to
home
the
point
mainly
be
that
city
college
cost
just
a
fraction
of
what
it
cost
to
go
to
princeton
but
carl
be
adamant
about
princeton
he
say
and
his
father
finally
agree
to
pay
half
his
tuition
at
this
point
in
what
i
suspect
be
a
well
polished
story
carl
grin
i
paid
the
rest
with
my
poker
winning
he
say
show
those
preppie
rich
kid

thing
or
two
and
of
course

i
smile
like
the
world
s
best
listener
as
he
continued
he
major
in
philosophy
of
all
thing
and
shade
of
my
parent

for
me
go
to
nyu
medical
school
for
two
year
before
drop
out
and
join
the
army
he
begin
work
as
a
wall
street
stockbroker
at
twenty
five
he
say
and
seven
year
later
i
bought
a
seat
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
he

didn
t
say
much
just
smile
as
her
husband
recount
all
his
success
somehow
though
his
monologue
then
turn
to
his

for
him
and
carl

proud
smile
disappear
these

silver
platter
my

portfolio
be
load
with
netflix
and
apple
and
he
s
mint
money
do
he
deserve
it
i
don
t
know
at
this
point
as
a
father
myself
i
felt
compel
to
say
something
carl
he
s
your
son
i
told
him
if
all
go
accord
to
plan
he
s
go
to
outlive
you
don
t
you

icahn
shrug

can
pay
his
own
way
he
make
a
dismissive
gesture
rid
on
my
coattail
he
say
wow
i
thought
what
a
dad
i
cut
my
meat
loaf
and
ate
a
bit
carl
hadn
t
be
far
off
about
his
wife
s
cooking
and
i
hadn
t
be
far
off
in
my
estimate
of
him
as
a
human
be
we
ate
in
silence
for
a
little
while
then
gail
take
our
plate
into
the
kitchen
it
be
time
to
get
to
the
point
so
what
s
your
plan
i
ask
him
he
look
genuinely
fluster
for
a
moment
what
do
you
mean
he
say
what
s
your
plan
i
repeat
you
ve
get
an
offer
to
take
control
of
the
company
what
s
your
strategy
who
s
go
to
run
it
who
s
go
to
be
the
management
that
s
when
something
strange
happen
for
just
a
brief
flash
of
a
second
carl
icahn
look
scar
if
we
be
play
poker
this
would
ve
be
his
tell
oh
i
ve
get
people
he
finally
say
i
ve
get
candidate
a
lot
of
people
be
interested
be
that
right
oh
yeah
sure
he
dabbed
at
his
mouth
with
his
napkin
listen
michael
he
say
maybe
we
can
do
a
deal
you
and
me
maybe
at
the
right
price
i
ll
offer
you
a
deal
mighty
big
of
you
i
thought
and
what
might
that
right
price
be
i
ask
him
he
seem
delighted
he
seem
to
think
that
we
be
actually
bargaining
right
there
at
his
dinner
table
oh
a
little
north
of
where
you
guy
be
now
he
say
how
far
north
how
do
fourteen
a
share
sound
he
say
you
could
make
a
lot
of
money
on
this
michael
and
your
plan
for
the
company
would
be
oh
you
know
economy
of
scale
offload
unproductive
acquisition
there
s
all
kind
of
thing
to
be
do
it
be
time
to
low
the
boom
i
look
him
in
the
eye
you
know
what
carl
i
say
i
don
t
think
you
have
a
plan
i
think
if
you
want
to
buy
the
company
for
fourteen
dollar
a
share
you
should
go
right
ahead
i
think
you
re
go
to
totally
screw
dell
up
and
meanwhile
i
ll
just
go
to
hawaii
and
take
six
month
off
lose
twenty
pound
then
come
home
and
buy
it
back
from
you
for
eight
dollar
a
share
that
ll
be
an
excellent
deal
for
me
he
look
gobsmacked
he
wasn
t
a
guy
who
d
naturally
come
across
as
be
insecure
or
fearful
but
right
now
he
look
like
a
guy
hold
a
seven
high
poker
hand
nothing
the
fear
have
return
to
his
eye
what
be
he
afraid
of
that
i
might
really
walk
away
leave
him
with
this
giant
thing
he
d
paid
a
share
for
this
giant
thing
he
be
totally
clueless
about
and
the
team
around
him
would
probably
leave
as
well
that
he
d
be
left
hold
a
very
big
bag
but
just
then
his
wife
return
to
the
table
carry
a
plate
contain
something
that
look
like
pie


carl
gail

m
really
sorry

say
i
ve

an
early
meeting

percent
over
dell
stock
s
average
closing
price
in
the
month
before
the
rumor
broke
it
be
great
to
have
the

seal
of
approval
whether
we
could
get
the
backing
of
a
majority
of
the

be
another
question
and
one
that
turn
out
to
be
a
lot
more
complicate
than
i
d
anticipate

he
be
still
smart
from
the
remark
i
d
make
at
our
strange
dinner
together
maybe
he
be
mad
at
me
for
refuse
to
play
along
whatever
play
along
would
ve
entail
in
any
case
he
quickly
go
on
the
offensive
again
throw
out
a
juicy
new
tidbit
that
the
business
medium

right
up

thing
be
get
messy
it
be
strange
it
be
embarrass
it
be
unsettle
not
only
do
the
company
i
have
start
and
guide
to
global
success
seem
up
for
grab
but
so
do
my
place
at
the
helm
none
of
it
felt
respectful
to
dell
s
achievement
and
aim
and
value
do
i
imagine
for
a
moment
that
icahn
could
or
would
actually
take
dell
over
and
install
new
leadership
and
a
friendly
board
of
director
the
chance
of
that
happen
i
believe
be
infinitesimal
but
not
zero
i
ll
freely
admit
that
that
teeny
tiny
chance
of
an
awful
outcome
cause
me
to
lose
some
sleep
that
spring
and
summer
but
mainly
i
worried
about
the
ripple
effect
of
icahn
s
self
serve
theatrics
on
a
very
practical
basis
i
be
concerned
about
our
run
rate
business
the
day
to
day
working
of
dell
we
d
already
lose
customer
because
of
all
the
uncertainty
and
we
stood
to
lose
more
imagine
be
one
of
them
let
s
say
i
m
a
decision
maker
inside
one
of
these
company
and
i
happen
to
be
watch
bloomberg
one
day
and
i
see
all
this
mishegoss
go
on
do
i
decide
to
go
with
dell
or
with
one
of
our
competitor
but
i
be
even
more
worried
about
what
our
thousand
of
team
member
in
round
rock
and
around
the
world
be
think
i
thought
about
all
the
good
people
make
or
a
year
go
home
to
their
spouse
i
thought
about
all
those
spouse
say
so
what
s
this
thing
i
saw
on
tv
about
how
you
re
go
to
have
a
new
ceo
who
s
in
charge
over
there
be
this
really
a
good
company
for
you
to
be
work
for
that
be
horrible
that
be
the
bad
possible
thing
bad
than
the
personal
embarrassment
to
me
which
be
real
yes
i
could
handle
it
i
could
stand
up
in
front
of
of
our
people
in
montpellier
france
or
chengdu
or
bangalore
or
beijing
look
at
me
like
hmm
be
he
go
to
be
the
ceo
or
not
i
could
deal
with
dispense
all
those
tightly
script
reassurance
still
this
be
not
the
way
chief
executive
officer
of
major
corporation
be
suppose
to
traverse
the
world
there
be
even
a
really
weird
period
that
spring
when
the
board
told
me
not
to
talk
to
any
executive
in
the
company
this
be
unprecedented
i
don
t
think
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
current
business
of
the
company
i
think
the
board
member
be
concerned
that
other
executive
and
i
might
drift
into
the
subject
of
the
go
private
and
i
might
color
their
think
this
didn
t
last
a
long
time
but
it
be
long
enough
i
remember
wonder
be
i
suppose
to
go
to
the
office
or
not
right
around
then
i
get
a
call
from
brian
krzanich
the
ceo
of
intel
hey
michael
he
say
i
just
want
you
to
know
i
ve
read
all
these
story
and
i
m
think
about
you
you
re
a
really
important
customer
of
ours
and
if
there
s
anything
we
can
do
to
help
just
let
me
know
i
thanked
brian
sincerely
we
didn
t
need
any
concrete
help
from
intel
but
the
emotional
support
meant
a
lot
and
there
be
other
call
and
message
of
encouragement
note
and
email
from
friend
and
acquaintance
and
colleague
i
appreciate
every
one
but
i
ll
always
remember
that
spring
and
summer
as
a
time
when
just
keep
an
even
keel
require
all
my
concentration


the
proxy
statement
the
dell
board
sent
to
the
sec
in
support
of
silver
lake
and
me
spoke
of
the
considerable
business
and
transaction
risk
that
a
buyout
would
shift
from
the
company
to
us
it
spell
out
in
detail
yet
again
the
deteriorate
industry
dynamic
for
our
pc
sale
and
the
resultant
decline
in
our
key
financial
metric
the
stockholder
would
do
best
by
cash
out
now
the
board
argue
on
june
icahn
fire
back
in
an
open
letter
to
our
stockholder
he
announce
that
he
be
buying
half
of
southeastern
asset
management
s
stake
in
dell
million
share
this
would
bring
his
stake
in
the
company
to
over
million
share
second
only
to
mine
surprisingly
the
purchase
price
be
only
per
share
below
our
deal
price
and
far
below
the
per
share
that
southeastern
have
argue
be
dell
s
true
value
respond
to
the
board
s
proxy
missive
icahn
say
we
be
amaze
by
these
statement
by
the
dell
board
in
what
other
context
would
the
person
tasked
with
sell
a
product
actually
spend
their
effort
negatively
position
the
very
product
they
be
try
to
sell
be
that
how
the
suppose
go
shop
be
conduct
can
you
imagine
a
real
estate
broker
run
advertisement
warn
of
termite
danger
in
a
house
each
time
a
prospective
buyer
seem
interested
then
he
go
on
tv
for
the
umpteenth
time
to
press
his
case
far
don
t
you
think
that
the
stock
will
be
worth
more
than
fourteen
dollar
he
ask
bloomberg
news
rhetorically
especially
since
the
fourteen
billion
dollar
spent
in
non
pc
acquisition
haven
t
really
kick
in
yet
the
company
have
put
out
these
dire
scary
statement
about
its
future
in
a
totalitarian
state
propaganda
of
this
type
work
however
luckily
for
the
shareholder
in
our
country
there
can
be
someone
to
counterbalance
the
propaganda
on
june
he
announce
he
be
team
with
his
financial
adviser
the
investment
bank
jefferies
co
to
raise
billion
in
loan
to
back
his
per
share
offer
he
say
he
be
confident
the
financing
would
be
in
place
in
time
for
the
july
stockholder
meeting
super
carl
to
the
rescue
or
not
if
you
look
through
all
the
smoke
icahn
be
blowing
you
quickly
realize
that
his
so
call
financing
be
just
more
smoke
as
a
piece
in
the
online
technology
journal
all
thing
digital
say
of
the
billion
icahn
and
his
affiliate
have
put
up
billion
with
billion
more
from
investment
bank
jefferies
and
co
an
additional
million
come
from
fourteen
other
party
include
pension
fund
and
institutional
investor
with
name
like
the
public
employee
retirement
association
of
new
mexico
and
the
manulife
float
rate
income
fund
it
s
a
relatively
short
list
reuters
say
suggest
that
icahn
have
trouble
attract
interest
but
on
the
other
hand
there
be
sign
he
didn
t
want
much
participation
from
third
party
in
the
first
place
confuse
yup
here
s
another
thing
icahn
doesn
t
get
the
funding
unless
dell
shareholder
elect
the
full
slate
of
twelve
director
candidate
he
and
his
partner
southeastern
asset
management
nominate
on
may
without
that
the
funding
be
unlikely
to
take
place
the
unavoidable
conclusion
yet
again
be
that
icahn
didn
t
really
want
to
buy
the
company
at
all
he
be
just
try
to
force
us
to
raise
our
offer
and
make
his
share
worth
that
much
more
but
while
carl
be
spin
every
reporter
in
sight
two
big
thing
go
our
way
on
june
chancellor
leo
strine
of
the
delaware
chancery
court
delaware
be
where
we
like
many
other
company
be
incorporate
and
the
state
s
chancery
court
would
ultimately
rule
on
the
deal
dismiss
a
raft
of
suit
that
have
be
brought
by
icahn
and
southeastern
in
essence
these
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
suit
charge
that
i
have
a
control
interest
in
dell
that
i
be
work
both
side
of
the
deal
and
that
i
be
exert
improper
insider
influence
in
several
of
his
many
interview
icahn
have
even
accuse
me
of
secretly
be
in
cahoot
with
the
special
committee
yet
chancellor
strine
held
that
my
percent
ownership
didn
t
put
me
anywhere
close
to
the
level
of
stock
ownership
that
s
ever
be
consider
a
control
stockholder
if
anything
chancellor
strine
say
icahn
and
southeastern
together
might
be
a
more
control
force
than
me
since
i
have
pledge
to
vote
my
million
share
in
favor
of
a
high
bidder
should
one
come
along
and
icahn
southeastern
be
under
no
such
obligation
chancellor
strine
note
that
contrary
to
the
class
action
suit
claim
the
special
committee
have
exhaust
every
possible
option
in
seek
a
richer
offer
than
silver
lake
s
and
mine
and
that
i
have
satisfied
every
legal
criterion
for
cooperate
with
the
committee
the
result
he
say
would
be
a
comparatively
lenient
judicial
standard
when
the
management
buyout
group
s
offer
ours
go
to
trial
i
like
this
guy
chancellor
strine
s
opinion
be
a
big
blow
to
icahn
but
then
come
another
on
june
i
go
with
brian
gladden
our
cfo
to
gaithersburg
maryland
to
try
and
persuade
the
good
people
at
institutional
shareholder
service
i
that
our
deal
be
the
best
one
possible
for
the
owner
of

i
the
premier

firm
be
paid
by
shareholder
to
ass
the
kind
of
proposal
dell
stockholder
be
now
look
at
the
firm
s
assessment
be
go
to
matter
a
lot
and
i
take
it
very
seriously
particularly
because
back
in
april
i
have
issue
a
report
that
take
a
skeptical
view
of
our
buyout
offer
the
overarch
question
it
say
do
not
appear
to
be
how
do
we
get
this
deal
do
but
rather
something
with
a
much
far
horizon
if
this
be
the
best
m
a
valuation
available
do
we
really
want
to
sell
at
all
i
kept
think
of
the
meeting
as
the
battle
of
gaithersburg
for
a
few
morning
i
d
be
get
up
extra
early
to
study
every
possible
angle
of
our
proposal
and
to
put
together
the
strong
case
i
could
muster
i
come
up
with
a
list
of
argument
this
be
the
company
i
start
twenty
nine
year
ago
and
have
guide
ever
since
it
s
crucial
now
to
keep
it
on
the
right
path
and
i
care
what
s
go
to
happen
long
after
i
m
go
i
ve
see
the
pace
of
our
industry
accelerate
and
keep
up
with
it
be
critical
it
s
essential
to
control
dell
s
transition
from
hardware
to
software
service
and
solution
to
mobile
and
the
cloud
transform
as
quickly
as
possible
be
urgent
change
or
die
the
change
we
re
in
the
process
of
make
will
provide
the
stability
our
customer
want
and
the
flexibility
the
company
need
but
the
risk
we
re
undertaking
will
make
the
road
forward
a
bumpy
one
with
inevitable
setback
probably
too
uncertain
a
scenario
for
our
public
stockholder
taste
transformation
be
rate
limited
for
a
public
company
the
five
new
area
we
re
move
into
and
the
investment
require
to
make
them
successful
will
low
earnings
in
the
near
term
many
stockholder
won
t
like
this
from
the
start
of
this
process
last
august
i
ve
make
it
clear
that
i
m
willing
to
join
with
whoever
offer
the
best
outcome
for
our
shareholder
and
i
ve
recognize
that
whoever
offer
that
outcome
may
or
may
not
include
me
in
their
plan
a
no
vote
on
our
proposal
would
be
a
vote
of
no
confidence
for
the
board
our
management
and
the
transformation
strategy
and
would
cause
extreme
disruption
to
the
company
icahn
and
southeastern
say
the
company
be
worth
more
than
our
offer
but
they
ve
propose
no
realistic
alternative
it
s
all
smoke
and
mirror
they
have
not
offer
our
shareholder
even
per
share
more
than
our
offer
they
ve
overstate
their
available
cash
by
billion
they
have
no
real
way
to
guarantee
a
dividend
their
so
call
new
management
team
be
also
an
illusion
both
capella
and
hurd
have
say
they
re
not
interested
todd
bradley
say
he

mike
daniel
have
a
noncompete
agreement
with
ibm
the
meeting
go
well
and
on
july
i
announce
its
decision
it
be
go
to
recommend
that
dell
shareholder
vote
in
favor
of
the
deal
a
couple
of
day
later
glass
lewis
another
proxy
advisory
firm
also
recommend
for
in
a
way
icahn
give
us
both
recommendation
by
create
an
alternative
so
bad
that
ours
be
the
obvious
choice
this
be
a
major
shot
in
the
arm
at
the
same
time
i
still
wonder
and
worried
could
we
get
the
vote
my
uncertainty
center
on
a
rule
the
special
committee
have
set
down
at
the
begin
in
addition
to
get
approval
of
a
majority
of
the
outstanding
share
include
mine
we
also
need
the
approval
of
a
majority
of
the
outstanding
share
that
be
not
own
by
me
or
dell
affiliate
in
this
second
vote
my
share
wouldn
t
count
but
icahn
s
and
southeastern
asset
management
s
would
and
abstention
and
share
that
didn
t
show
up
at
all
would
effectively
be
count
as
no
vote
if
the
share
price
rise
on
good
news
like
the
i
decision
prior
to
the
july
meeting
large
block
of
stock
be
bound
to
be
sell
and
as
the
rule
stood
the
new
owner
of
the
stock
because
they
hadn
t
held
their
share
as
of
the
june
record
date
wouldn
t
be
allow
to
vote
but
the
former
owner
of
those
share
have
sell
their
holding
would
have
no
interest
in
voting
and
their
failure
to
vote
would
be
count
as
vote
against
our
offer
this
voting
standard
be
know
as
majority
of
the
minority
outstanding
minority
refer
to
unaffiliated
share
those
not
held
by
me
or
my
family
and
other
insider
and
outstanding
meaning
all
share
whether
vote
or
not
it
be
an
extraordinarily
stringent
rule
but
it
be
of
a
piece
with
every
move
the
special
committee
make
from
the
begin
they
have
bent
over
backward
to
avoid
any
hint
of
collusion
with
me
three
day
later
icahn
sent
out
another
one
of
his
open
letter
it
be
a
masterpiece
of
wheedle
dear
fellow
dell
stockholder
it
begin
chummily
on
rare
occasion
in
invest
one
come
across
situation
that
be
no
brainers
in
these
situation
the
odds
be
greatly
in
your
favor
of
make
a
profit
while
take
very
little
risk
and
in
some
very
rare
situation
you
can
make
a
profit
while
take
no
risk
at
all
strangely
in
my
experience
many
investor
miss
the
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
these
situation
he
be
like
a
snake
charmer
or
a
snake
oil
salesman
in
a
carnival
sideshow
free
money
no
risk
all
his
fellow
dell
stockholder
have
to
do
he
continued
be
vote
no
at
the
july
meeting
then
if
the
merger
be
approve
anyway
claim
appraisal
right
and
what
be
appraisal
right
under
delaware
law
if
a
cash
merger
go
through
shareholder
who
vote
against
the
deal
or
who
didn
t
vote
have
sixty
day
to
decide
whether
to
accept
the
deal
or
go
to
court
for
an
appraisal
if
this
happen
with
us
and
the
delaware
chancery
court
rule
in
its
discretion
that
dell
stock
be
worth
a
high
price
the
purchasing
entity
silver
lake
and
i
would
have
to
pay
the
stockholder
that
much
more
but
the
court
could
also
determine
that
the
stock
s
value
be
low
and
in
this
case
shareholder
who
claimed
appraisal
right
would
get
less
in
addition
anyone
claim
appraisal
right
would
have
to
wait
for
the
process
to
play
itself
out
which
could
take
year
icahn
be
just
flat
out
lie
to
say
there
be
no
risk
what
he
wasn
t
say
moreover
be
that
he
have
no
intention
of
claim
appraisal
right
himself
while
appraisal
be
be
resolve
it
s
as
if
the
owner
of
those
big
block
of
stock
be
loan
the
company
the
value
of
their
share
this
be
just
another
mislead
proposal
on
icahn
s
part
the
transparent
reality
of
which
be
that
he
be
yet
again
only
try
to
pressure
silver
lake
and
me
to
raise
our
offer
to
prevent
those
big
shareholder
from
voting
no
and
if
you
be
pay
close
attention
and
believe
me
i
be
the
reality
of
icahn
s
july
letter
be
that
he
d
basically
give
up
on
try
to
buy
the
company
himself
if
he
could
get
his
high
share
price
from
us
he
could
cash
out
and
declare
victory


but
neither
silver
lake
nor
i
be
inclined
to
be
pressure
by
icahn
to
strengthen
our
cause
in
the
week
lead
up
to
the
shareholder
meeting
i
do
some
more
travel
fly
around
the
country
to
meet
with
some
of
our
big
shareholder
like
franklin
mutual
and
blackrock
and
state
street
and
pentwater
to
tell
them
why
i
thought
our
proposal
be
fair
and
my
lobbying
get
result
as
the
big

blackrock
state

t
say
about
his
wife
s
meat
loaf
all
of
icahn
s
takeover
blathering
would
ve
be
funny
because
it
be
so
absurd
but
what
wasn
t
funny
at
all
be
the
effect
the
chaos
he
be
sow
be
have
on
our
stock
price
in
early
july
share
slip
under
for
the
first
time
since
april
then
in
the
aftermath
of
the
adjourn
meeting
they
stayed
in
the
twelve
for
a
week
then
eight
nine
ten
day
in
a
row
the
market
be
give
its
verdict
on
the
chance
our
deal
would
happen
and
the
chance
didn
t
look
good


on
july
i
met
with
the
special
committee
at
the
manhattan
office
of
my
lawyer
wachtell
lipton
alex
mandl
be
there
with
the
committee
s
lawyer
and
financial
adviser
people
from
mackenzie
attend
as
well
i
spoke
and
i
spoke
passionately
because
i
felt
strongly
as
it
stood
i
say
the
rule
that
count
share
that
didn
t
vote
as
vote
against
the
deal
make
the
voting
standard
blatantly
unfair
allow
a
minority
of
share
to
override
the
majority
base
on
those
voting
the
appearance
the
special
committee
have
be
try
to
avoid
that
they
and
i
be
somehow
in
cahoot
conspire
against
the
stockholder
have
long
since
be
contradict
both
in
the
financial
medium
and
the
outpouring
of
open
letter
to
our
shareholder
we
silver
lake
and
i
have
clearly
butt
head
with
the
committee
on
any
number
of
occasion
the
line
be
clear
it
be
time
to
make
the
fight
fair
and
we
found
ourselves
butting
head
yet
again
alex
told
me
that
the
special
committee
might
might
consider
change
the
voting
standard
if
and
only
if
silver
lake
and
i
raise
our
offer
to
at
least
a
share
meeting
adjourn
the
next
morning
after
a
long
talk
with
egon
i
phone
alex
and
told
him
that
silver
lake
and
i
would
increase
our
offer
to
if
and
only
if
the
special
committee
would
stop
counting
share
that
didn
t
vote
as
no
vote
this
be
our
best
and
final
offer
i
say
after
confer
with
the
rest
of
the
committee
and
all
their
adviser
alex
told
me
they
need
some
time
to
think
about
it
accordingly
the
shareholder
meeting
schedule
for
july
be

from

southeastern
and
sent
to
the
special
committee
on
july
lady
and
gentleman
in
our
year
in
business
we
have
witness
many
unconscionable
board
but
we
think
that
the
ongoing
desperate
dell
debacle
stand
out
as
one
of
the
most
startle
example
amazingly
through
it
all
the
special
committee
continue
to
remind
us
just
how
much
they
believe
that
they
be
take
care
of
us
watch
out
for
us
and
protect
us
we
have
a
number
of
question
for
these
self
congratulatory
champion
of
dell
stockholder
why
freeze
out
dell
stockholder
why
be
the
special
committee
so
commit
to
force
loyal
dell
stockholder
out
of
dell
so
that
our
company
can
be
sell
to
michael
dell
silver
lake
at
what
we
believe
be
a
bargain
price
how
long
can
board
push
out
and
change
meeting
date
and
hide
behind
the
business
judgment
rule
the
answer
my
friend
be
blowin
in
the
wind
will
the
special
committee
keep
its
promise
on
july
the
special
committee
told
us
that
it
have
take
extraordinary
measure
to
ensure
mr
dell
s
neutrality
and
to
leave
the
final
decision
with
the
disinterested
stockholder
if
you
believe
the
special
committee
do
not
take
extraordinary
measure
to
ensure
mr
dell
s
neutrality
and
to
leave
the
final
decision
with
the
disinterested
stockholder
when
they
postpone
last
thursday
s
vote
then
we
urge
you
to
vote
against
the
michael
dell
silver
lake
transaction
and
so
on
and
so
forth
ad
nauseam
and
on
the
follow
day
icahn
take
the
fight
to
twitter
with
one
of
his
first

would
be

at

if
michael

the
board
bid
farewell
bob

he
wasn
t
but
do
it
get
attention
icahn
always
do


saying
don
t
create
success
but
we
do
have
a
say
at
dell
failure
be
not
an
option
we
know
great
strategy
and
execution
be
what
creates
success
we
be
at
the
end
of
the
go
private
process
it
have
take
too
long
it
be
disruptive
it
have
create
confusion
and
uncertainty
and
my
ally
and
i
be
all
i
wouldn
t
say
exhaust
but
we
be
very
ready
for
it
to
be
over
one
way
or
another
if
the
shareholder
want
a
deal
we
would
find
a
deal
and
make
it
happen
if
they
didn
t
want
a
deal
we
d
just
go
back
to
what
we
be
do
if
shareholder
vote
for
the
deal
they
would
receive
some
of
the
reward
of
our
potential
success
without
have
to
bear
any
of
the
risk
of
the
transformation
silver
lake
and
i
be
take
all
the
risk
in
hindsight
it
s
easy
to
point
out
that
it
work
but
it
could
ve
fail
the
same
day
icahn
sent
his
missive
i
sent
out
an
open
letter
to
our
stockholder
break
my
silence
for
the
first
time
in
a
few
month
about
the
battle
of
the
past
year
this
be
me
declare
here
s
the
deal
take
it
or
leave
it
dear
fellow
shareholder
you
have
undoubtedly
read
many
story
about
our
effort
to
take
dell
private
i
want
you
to
hear
directly
from
me
i
believe
that
take
dell
private
be
the
right
thing
to
do
for
the
company
we
need
to
transform
and
we
need
to
do
it
quickly
the
transformation
be
not
without
risk
and
challenge
and
i
believe
that
we
can
do
what
we
need
to
do
well
as
a
private
company
than
a
public
company
when
i
come
to
the
dell
board
last
august
to
ask
if
the
board
would
consider
the
possibility
of
a
go
private
transaction
i
understood
that
the
independent
director
would
control
the
process
and
i
make
clear
that
i
be
ready
to
partner
with
whoever
would
pay
the
high
price
i
encourage
every
interested
party
to
pay
the
high
price
they
could
after
one
of
the
most
thorough
process
in
history
the
high
price
that
any
of
the
party
be
willing
to
pay
be
per
share
although
no
other
party
have
offer
to
pay
more
than
per
share
silver
lake
and
i
have
now
increase
our
offer
to
per
share
an
increase
to
public
shareholder
of
approximately
million
which
be
our
best
and
final
offer
i
believe
this
offer
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
company
and
our
shareholder
certain
other
party
have
be
propose
alternative
such
as
leveraged
recapitalizations
sale
of
asset
and
other
step
that
i
believe
would
be
destructive
to
the
company
and
that
i
do
not
and
will
not
support
the
decision
be
now
yours
i
be
at
peace
either
way
and
i
will
honor
your
decision
our
agreement
require
the
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
unaffiliated
share
your
share
to
approve
the
transaction
unfortunately
our
agreement
also
provide
that
share
that
do
not
vote
count
as
vote
against
the
transaction
currently
over
of
the
unaffiliated
share
have
not
vote
this
mean
that
even
if
a
majority
of
the
unaffiliated
share
that
vote
on
the
transaction
want
to
accept
our
offer
the
will
of
the
majority
may
be
defeat
by
the
share
that
do
not
vote
i
think
this
be
clearly
unfair
when
we
offer
to
increase
our
bid
to
per
share
we
also
ask
the
special
committee
of
the
board
to
change
this
unfair
vote
standard
and
allow
the
will
of
the
majority
of
the
unaffiliated
share
that
vote
on
the
transaction
to
control
the
outcome
particularly
give
the
effort
of
others
to
promote
alternative
transaction
and
the
ability
of
those
party
to
vote
their
share
when
my
share
do
not
count
it
make
no
sense
whatsoever
to
skew
the
play
field
even
far
by
counting
share
not
voting
as
if
they
support
the
opposition
group
if
the
special
committee
agrees
to
our
increase
bid
of
per
share
and
agrees
to
create
a
fair
and
level
play
field
in
which
you
can
decide
i
will
look
forward
to
your
decision
sincerely
michael
dell
two
day
later
july
i
go
to
alex
mandl
s
house
in
easton
maryland
to
try
to
convince
him
to
accept
our
offer
i
spent
ninety
tense
minute
argue
to
alex
that
icahn
s
bombastic
broadside
be
play
havoc
with
the
stock
price
that
the
continue
uncertainty
about
what
be
go
to
happen
be
corrosive
to
the
company
that
the
bending
over
backward
to
be
impartial
voting
standard
that
count
share
not
voting
as
vote
against

real
opinion

and
nod
nod
and
frown
he
heard
me
but
he
never
spoke
a
word
of
agreement
his
own
belief
he
finally
say
be
that
if
silver
lake
and
i
be
to
increase
our
offer
to
a
share
the
tide
would
turn
without
any
need
to
change
the
voting
standard
i
say
i
d
discus
it
with
silver
lake
but
i
wasn
t
optimistic
meanwhile
our
stock
continued
to
languish
and
somewhere
offstage
but
not
for
long
carl
icahn

his
hand

up
up
and
away
lee
walker
change
his
mind
and
to
this
day
i
don
t
fully
understand
why
what
make
him
give
up
a
summer
in
the
beautiful
south
of
france
to
stick
around
hot
and
humid
austin
texas
and
help
get
a
little
computer
company
off
the
ground
i
ve
ask
him
about
it
more
than
once
in
his
shy
and
modest
way
he
ll
mumble
something
about
have
once
be
in
the
same
spot
himself
when
lee
be
a
young
entrepreneur
in
the
early
s
he
make
a
heavily
leveraged
purchase
of
a
buffalo
new
york
steel
fabrication
business
soon
after
he
come
on
board
the
company
sell
a
metal
recycle
furnace
a
big
ticket
piece
of
equipment
to
a
florida
customer
only
to
have
the
customer
refuse
to
pay
after
the
florida
department
of
environmental
regulation
der
ban
the
use
of
the
machine
the
lose
payment
put
lee
s
fledgling
company
operating
on
the
thinnest
of
margin
in
danger
of
go
under
and
lee
himself
on
the
edge
of
personal
bankruptcy
out
of
sheer
desperation
he
flew
to
florida
and
make
a
personal
appeal
to
the
der
which
to
his
amazement
give
the
machine
a
variance
lee
get
paid
his
company
survive
and
his
entrepreneurial
career
go
on
to
flourish
so
he
knew
a
thing
or
two
about
narrow
escape
and
over
the
year
he
d
learn
a
number
of
hard
lesson
about
corporate
finance
an
area
where
in
the
spring
of
i
be
still
learn
on
the
job
in
certain
way
pc
s
limited
be
do
amazingly
well
give
our
fiscal
limitation
because
i
d
start
the
company
with
only
of
invest
capital
as
contrast
with
the
almost
million
that
compaq
our
rival
down
the
road
in
houston
have
raise
from
investor
by
late
i
have
to
figure
out
how
to
stretch
the
limited
capital
we
have
to
the
max
i
get
pretty
good
at
it
our
initial
sale
be
usually
by
credit
card
this
meant
that
we
get
paid
exactly
when
we
ship
out
an
order
that
be
a
good
thing
but
at
first
we
often
have
to
pay
for
material
ahead
of
time
hard
to
do
when
you
have
limited
cash
on
hand
as
we
grow
however
we
be
able
to
convince
supplier
to
sell
to
us
on
term
meaning
we
would
pay
them
thirty
day
after
we
receive
their
product
in
addition
by
sell
directly
to
customer
and
not
have
to
build
finish
good
inventory
we
could
keep
our
part
inventory
very
low
if
you
know
exactly
what
the
customer
want
to
buy
you
only
need
the
part
require
for
those
order
by
contrast
company
that
build
finish
good
inventory
in
multiple
configuration

and
age
quickly
by

we
benefit
from
the
late

and
as

almost
always

another
advantage
credit

on
term
strip
part
inventory
to
the
bone
all
these
thing
kept
our
cash
conversion
cycle
the
time
it
take
for
cash
to
be
convert
into

and
account
payable
through
sale
and
account

and
then
back
into
cash
far
low
than
most
other
company
this
be
very
good
on
the
other
hand
our
fast
growth
be
sell
to
company
government
agency
and
education
and
medical
institution
entity
that
be
not
go
to
pay
us
with
credit
card
we
need
to
extend
them
term
which
meant
that
we
need
more
credit
a
lot
of
it
and
that
be
something
i
definitely
need
help
with
that
spring
i
be
so
busy
run
my
own
new
company
that
i
have
no
idea
how
close
to
real
financial
trouble
we
be
but
lee
found
out
just
before
he
join
us
when
an
officer
of
mbank
our
backer
take
him
to
lunch
and
advise
him
to
stay
away
from
pc
s
limited
compuadd
an
austin
company
with
a
business
similar
to
ours
though
they
be
more
component
than
system
orient
and
have
open
several
retail
store
be
the
horse
to
bet
on
this
banker
told
lee
as
for
pc
s
limited
the
banker
say
mbank
have
decide
to
freeze
our
credit
line
at
i
do
some
mental
math
lee
later
recall
i
remember
jim
seymour
have
told
me
that
michael
s
sale
be
about
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
a
day
that
meant
mbank
be
financing
only
about
six
day
of
sale
my
rule
of
thumb
glean
from
hard
year
of
experience
be
that
you
need
funding
for
at
least
twenty
four
day
of
sale
six
day
six
hundred
thousand
dollar
be
impossible
mbank
have
decide
to
put
its
boot
down
on
dell
s
financial
windpipe
michael
s
supplier
have
to
be
way
past
due
in
get
paid
and
they
must
be
kick
down
his
door
scream
for
money
it
wasn
t
quite
that
dramatic
but
money
be
sorely
need
and
lee
walker
knew
where
and
how
to
get
it
luckily
for
me
this
extremely
tall
very
thoughtful
and
knowledgeable
guy
suddenly
reverse
his
decision
not
to
be
president
of
pc
s
limited
and
from
the
day
he
walk
in
the
door
we
shift
into
a
brand
new
gear


my
legal
adviser
kelley
guest
have
already
briefed
lee
for
the
semi
chaos
he
be
about
to
face
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
kelley
say
be
get
rid
of
that
cfo
and
the
chief
accounting
officer
the
fact
that
they
re
married
to
each
other
be
just
the
begin
of
the
problem
with
them
i
didn
t
care
that
they
be
married
what
bother
me
about
mr
bolton
be
that
every
time
i
told
him
we
need
more
work
capital
he
threw
up
his
hand
and
told
me
how
tough
it
be
out
there
but
when
lee
told
mr
and
mr
bolton
that
it
be
time
for
them
to
go
they
make
an
interest
demand
we
want
fifty
thousand
dollar
to
not
hit
the
destruct
button
on
this
business
mr
bolton
say
it
wasn
t
an
idle
threat
the
couple
have
all
kind
of
button
they
could
push

they
could
pull
to

what

didn
t
have
be

some
pretty
big
challenge
one
of
the
big
be
quality
control
in
september
we
get
a
phone
call
from
a
furious
customer
in

iowa
claim
that
a
computer
we
d
sell
him
have
burst
into

in
his

cause
grievous
damage
to
his

he
be
go
to
sue
us
for
all
we
have
and
then
some
treble
damage
for
interstate
fraud
he
scream
unfortunately
he
wasn
t
the
only
customer
this
have
happen
to
and
there
be
quite
a
few
other
quality
complaint
as
well
quality
complaint
meant
return
and
repair
meant
slowdown
in
production
and
if
we
didn
t
get
the
manufacturing
right
as
lee
walker
would
later
say
we
be
screw
oddly
enough
it
be
another
irate
communication
that
lead
to
a
solution
this
one
be
a
cease
and
desist
letter
from
a
guy
name
bob
swem
the
manager
of
tandem
computer
north
austin
terminal
plant
swem
claimed
we
d
be
pirate
some
of
his
best
employee
a
charge
that
be
half
true
we
do
no
recruiting
but
we
certainly
have
be
fielding
a
lot
of
job
request
from
local
tech
worker
and
hire
more
than
a
few
of
them
know
your
adversary
be
always
a
good
rule
and
in
do
some
research
on
swem
and
his
factory
lee
discover
that
the
plant
manager
have
devise
a
brilliant
system
run
by
fault
tolerant
tandem
computer
and
software
that
assure
his
production
line
be
never
down
part
of
the
system
be
bar
cod
each
and
every
part
that
go
into
every
terminal
the
plant
manufacture
if
say
the
failure
of
a
watt
capacitor
somewhere
out
in
the
field
have
cause
a
terminal
to
break
down
swem
could
easily
track
which
other
terminal
out
there
contain
that
same
capacitor
alert
those
customer
that
a
replacement
be
need
and
get
one
to
them
before
trouble
start
pace
back
and
forth
between
our
office
lee
and
i
come
up
with
a
proposal
for
bob
swem
let
us
copy
his
tandem
base
system
for
our
production
line
and
we
would
refrain
from
hire
any
more
of
his
employee
what
s
more
we
would
tell
anyone
who
ask
how
tandem
have
contribute
to
our
greatly
improve
manufacturing
capability
swem
agree
and
our
quality
control
kick
up
a
notch
but
well
quality
control
didn
t
mean
perfection
our
computer
out
in
the
field
would
sometimes
go
wrong
as
computer
will
develop
problem
that
even
proactive
part
replacement
and
free
phone
support
couldn
t
solve
in
a
way
this
solution
reveal
an
even
graver
problem
ibm
and
compaq
held
percent
of
the
pc
market
we
be
try
to
shoulder
into
a
crowd
field
to
differentiate
ourselves
as
a
company
product
performance
feature
and
quick
order
turnaround
be
a
good
begin
but
one
critical
component
be
miss
we
be
turn
out
an
excellent
product
pc
magazine
have
recently
call
our

one
of
the
first
real
potential
ibm
killer
astoundingly
fast
but
our
corporate
identity
be
limited
to
say
the
least
we
be
an
austin
mail
order
outfit
and
mail
order
meant
down
market
step
up
would
mean
sell
in
quantity
to
big
company
company
like
exxon
boeing
ford
citibank
and
general
motor
we
be
hire
salesperson
to
court
the
business
market
but
while
we
could
offer
those
customer
an
excellent
product
what
we
couldn
t
afford
to
offer
be
the
kind
of
service
and
support
system
that
major
company
demand
we
be
get
a
lot
of
turndown
from
those
big
company
and
if
we
couldn
t
show
potential
investor
that
we
be
do
business
with
major
company
they
wouldn
t
be
interested
in
us
we
be
caught
in
a
double
bind
destine
for
smallness
a
minor
player
in
a
major
industry
unless
at
a
corporate
brainstorming
retreat
in
california
s
russian
river
valley
in
the
fall
of
a
trip
we
could
barely
afford
but
a
break
we
need
badly
if
we
be
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
raise
our
game
the
facilitator
ask
the
ten
of
us
present
to
engage
in
an
imagination
exercise
if
we
could
make
a
wish
that
would
come
true
he
ask
what
wish
would
we
make
for
our
service
and
support
problem
a
young
salesperson

kim

with
us
kim
be
great
super
outgo
and
enthusiastic
and
unlike
most
people
totally
unafraid
to
speak
up
i
wish
i
could
tell
my
customer
we
would
fix
their
problem
right
away
she
say
we
would
have
a
technician
on
their
doorstep
the
next
day
sound
great
the
facilitator
say
anything
else
and
i
wish
it
be
free
kim
say
there
be
a
collective
whoa
cool
from
all
of
us
present
but
cold
reality
almost
immediately
set
in
how
would
you
pay
for
that
then
again
break
through
limited
think
be
the
goal
of
the
retreat
and
we
wound
up
with
two
other
possibly
achievable
dream
besides
free
service
and
support
i
want
to
expand
internationally
and
we
need
to
step
up
our
effort
to
sell
to
big
company
six
month
later
we
d
achieve
the
first
two
goal
and
be
well
on
our
way
to
realize
the
third
when
ibm
whose
lunch
we
d
be
eat
decide
they
d
prefer
to
eat
our
lunch
instead
ever
since
they
d
introduce
the
open
architecture
personal
computer
in
international
business
machine
have
see
pc
clone
maker
like
us
proliferate
and
flourish
their
perhaps
defensive
public
stance
be
that
personal
computer
be
a
minor
part
of
their
business
then
maybe
all
the
success
of
hot
young
company
like
us
have
gotten
under
their
skin
they
suddenly
seem
to
change
their
mind
on
april
ibm
introduce

p
aka
micro
channel
architecture
it
be
hard
to
see
p
as
anything
other
than
a
way
to
kill
off
the
clone
maker
big
blue
want
to
put
the
genie
back
in
the
bottle
so
it
could
rule
the
pc
business
the
way
it
own
the
mainframe
market
it
be
an
empire
strike
back
moment
and
i
be
really
scar
that
this
would
be
the
end
of
luke
skywalker
i
mean
pc
s
limited
we
get
right
to
work
on
develop
our
own
micro
channel
clone
but
that
would
take
time
time
in
which
ibm
might
be
able
to
put
us
out
of
business


but
over
the
next
month
a
funny
thing
happen
as
ibm
try
to
sell
its
customer
on
switch
to
p
compaq
and
its
close
partner
intel
begin
develop
an
advance
on
the
industry
standard
architecture
that
would
become
know
as
eisa
extend
industry
standard
architecture
eisa
have
slot
in
the
system
that
allow
clone
maker
to
build
an
expansion
card
that
have
additional
capability
base
on
the
isa
standard
we
get
right
to
work
on
that
and
while
some
of
ibm
s
customer
go
with
p
most
of
them
didn
t
and
even
some
of
the
one
that
switch
soon
change
their
mind
and
go
back
to
eisa
in
the
end
p
backfire
because
while
it
contain
some
technical
innovation
it
be
design
more
with
ibm
s
benefit
in
mind
than
the
customer
s
we
d
dodge
a
bullet
but
that
wouldn
t
be
the
last
we
heard
from
ibm


in
june
we
officially
become
an
international
company
under
a
new
name
or
rather
a
new
old
name
just
before
we
launch
in
the
uk
andrew
harris
the
guy
lee
and
i
have
picked
to
head
the
operation
say
look
i
can
t
call
the
company
pc
s
limited
ltd
that
sound
ridiculous
so
what
should
i
call
it
back
in
austin
we
be
grow
so
fast
that
we
didn
t
have
a
moment
to
contemplate
such
minor
matter
we
basically
say
we
don
t
know
we
re
busy
you
figure
it
out
after
a
few
day
andrew
call
back
look
you
guy
won
t
tell
me
what
to
call
the
company
so
i
m
just
go
to
call
it
dell
computer
corporation
because
really
that
s
your
official
name
anyway
okay
whatever
i
say
so
for
a
couple
of
month
we
have
a
split
personality
back
in
the
us
everybody
thought
of
us
as
pc
s
limited
but
in
the
uk
we
be
dell
computer
corporation
there
be
a
certain
instability
to
the
arrangement
but
explosive
growth
be
never
about
stability
and
we
be
poise
to
go
global
the
uk
be
a
natural
market
for
us
because
lot
of
people
there
be
buying
not
very
well
make
pc
from
computer
store
whose
staff
knew
little
or
nothing
about
service
what
they
sell
whereas
we
be
not
only
turn
out
a
superior
product
but
thanks
to
a
deal
lee
walker
and
kelley
guest
have
sign
a
couple
of
month
earlier
have
just
become
the
world
s
first
personal
computer
manufacturer
to
offer
free
on
site
service
honeywell
bull
the
recently
merge
information
system
arm
of
the
international
conglomerate
honeywell
be
manufacturing
mainframe
then
and
their
global
service
operation
make
them
a
perfect
partner
for
us
under
the
term
of
the
contract
lee
and
kelley
have
work
out
we
would
pay
honeywell
bull
for
every
pc
we
produce
and
in
return
they
would
provide
free
same
or
next
day
onsite
service
for
any
computer
of
ours
that
need
it
anywhere
in
the
us
or
uk
we
decide
not
to
pas
along
the
to
the
customer
our
calculation
be
that
the
guarantee
of
free
on
site
service
would
create
enough
new
sale
volume
that
the
outlay
would
quickly
pay
for
itself
the
calculation
prove
correct
this
be
a
huge
step
up
for
us
we
could
now
sell
make
to
order
pc
s
limited
brand
computer
to
major
corporation
and
the
us
government
with
the
assurance
of
free
on
site
service
which
meant
that
major
corporation
and
the
us
government
would
no
longer
turn
away
our
salesperson
without
listen
to
them
and
with
a
forty
five
year
old
genuine
grown
up
and
experienced
entrepreneur
as
president
and
cfo
we
now
have
access
to
all
kind
of
work
capital
credit
we
couldn
t
get
before
unlike
the
twenty
one
year
old
ceo
lee
walker
could
go
to
people
like
frank
phillips
at
texas
commerce
bank
and
say
look
texaco
exxon
monsanto
all
these
company
not
to
mention
the
us
government
they
all
owe
this
company
money
give
us
a
loan
base
on
all
these
receivables
and
the
banker
would
say
okay
lee
we
don
t
know
about
the
kid
but
we
trust
you
still
mere
credit
wasn
t
enough
to
take
us
where
we
want
to
go
we
d
go
from
that
million
in
sale
in
fiscal
year
to
be
on
track
to
do
million
for
fy
it
wasn
t
so
crazy
to
think
that
we
could
get
to
million
plus
in
fy
and
after
that
who
knew
yet
crazily
we
have
just
over
in
cash
on
hand
lee
with
his
hand
firmly
on
the
fiscal
control
have
kept
us
in
the
black
but
just
barely
we
need
real
work
capital
not
just
a
line
of
credit
to
do
more
research
and
development
to
hire
more
people
to
buy
more
and
more
of
the
best
possible
component
take
the
company
public
seem
like
a
natural
progression
and
be
the
only
option
to
access
the
kind
of
capital
we
need
it
be
right
around
then
that
investment
bank
start
to
call
there
be
a
lot
of
suitor
we
be
a
young
hot
company
hotter
every
month
we
be
make
a
lot
of
noise
both
for
the
business
we
be
do
and
what
be
behind
it
a
product
that
be
high
quality
custom
built
and
because
there
be
no
retail
markup
very
competitively
price
a
half
dozen
of
these
banker
come
to
see
us
in
austin
they
foresaw
all
kind
of
greatness
for
us
and
they
told
us
all
kind
of
story
about
how
they
be
go
to
get
us
there
it
be
fun
to
hear
these
thing
but
after
each
of
the
meeting
lee
and
i
would
look
at
each
other
and
shake
our
head
it
s
great
be
told
exactly
what
you
want
to
hear
but
when
the
sugar
high
wear
off
you
re
left
wonder
if
there
be
any
actual
nutritional
content
there
we
need
to
get
the
straight
story
from
the
big
player
lee
and
i
go
to
new
york
city
in
the
spring
of
to
meet
with
some
of
the
big
investment
bank
in
town
curiously
enough
the
first
two
firm
we
go
to
be
company
my
mother
have
work
for
in
houston
e
f
hutton
be
famous
for
its
tv
commercial
when
e
f
hutton
talk
people
listen
little
do
we
know
that
some
of
their
stockbroker
be
then
under
federal
investigation
for
laundering
mob
money
and
that
the
company
would
soon
be
force
to
merge
with
shearson
lehman
american
express
their
office
felt
slow
and
sleepy
possibly
because
people
there
knew
or
sense
that
the
jig
be
up
paine
webber
have
its
own
popular
ad
campaign
thank
you
paine
webber
and
a
bright
shiny
new
headquarters
on
avenue
of
the
america
but
there
too
for
whatever
entirely
different
reason
the
atmosphere
felt
less
than
excite
goldman
sachs
be
anything
but
their
people
heck
even
their
office
wall
radiate
dynamism
intelligence
ambition
and
success
they
have
an
amaze
track
record
with
ipo
and
now
they
be
pitch
hard
to
be
our
wall
street
partner
once
again
lee
and
i
look
at
each
other
but
this
time
with
that
instant
intuitive
click
yes
goldman
have
just
two
caveat
for
us
the
first
be
that
lee
have
to
give
up
be
cfo
be
both
president
and
chief
financial
officer
didn
t
give
him
enough
objectivity
and
would
be
bad
optic
for
a
public
corporation
the
second
be
that
we
have
to
have
a
real
board
of
director
a
two
man
board
didn
t
cut
it
we
have
to
have
at
least
five
goldman
say
lee
and
i
confer
on
this
and
for
starter
come
up
with
the
two
best
people
we
could
think
of
in
austin
george
kozmetsky
be
a
guy
who
have
found
a
couple
of
fortune
company
and
be
the
dean
of
the
business
school
at
the
university
of
texas
he
d
also
found
a
think
tank
for
entrepreneur
call
ic
the
institute
for
constructive
capitalism
i
d
met
him
a
couple
of
time
and
held
him
in
high
regard
the
other
be
bobby
ray
inman
a
retire
navy
admiral
and
former
director
of
the
national
security
agency
also
former
deputy
director
of
the
cia
he
be
currently
run
a
consortium
of
top
technology
company
call
mcc
microelectronics
and
computer
technology
corporation
to
try
to
figure
out
how
to
out
invent
the
japanese
who
seem
at
the
time
to
be
on
the
way
to
world
technological
domination
lee
and
i
thought
both
be
superb
candidate
and
we
told
goldman
we
d
try
and
persuade
them
to
join
us
we
could
come
up
with
a
third
person
in
due
course
but
goldman
also
thought
that
we
shouldn
t
go
public
just
yet
the
process
be
complicate
and
time
consume
they
say
and
as
we
knew
all
too
well
we
have
our
hand
full
run
the
company
instead
they
recommend
a
private
placement
twenty
to
thirty
shareholder
among
financial
institution
high
net
worth
individual
and
various
fund
goldman
be
absolutely
confident
about
our
marketability
then
come
black
monday
october
on
that
single
day
the
stock
market
lose
percent
of
its
value
twice
as
much
as
it
have
lose
on
black
thursday
in
october
the
begin
of
the
great
depression
as
lee
remembers
it
when
he
come
into
my
office
to
give
me
the
bad
news
he
be
convince
our
private
placement
have
go
kaput
then
and
there
i
be
busy
at
one
of
my
favorite
pastime
take
apart
a
competitor
s
computer
to
see
how
it
stack
up
against
ours
maybe
i
should
ve
be
more
concerned
maybe
he
should
ve
be
less
concerned
lee
be
forty
six
year
old
and
inclined
to
worry
i
be
twenty
two
and
all
forward
motion
i
m
convince
to
this
day
that
we
could
have
go
on
just
fine
without
a
private
placement
our
growth
be
just
that
spectacular
but
lee
be
the
one
who
knew
the
reality
of
balance
sheet
and
banker
and
sometimes
those
reality
be
grim
enough
to
keep
him
awake
at
night
meanwhile
excite
about
our
future
i
slept
like
a
baby
and
as
it
turn
out
the
miraculous
happen
out
of
literally
hundred
of
financing
that
be
in
process
that
black
monday
ours
be
the
sole
survivor
as
thousand
of
buyer
bail
ours
stuck
with
us
why
because
people
believe
in
our
business
model
and
be
excite
by
the
opportunity
to
get
in
on
the
ground
floor
among
them
be
my
mom
and
dad
who
invest
a
half
million
dollar
a
significant
portion
of
their
saving
at
the
time
because
there
be
no
one
quite
like
us
across
the
whole
technical
landscape
and
because
you
just
couldn
t
argue
with
our
underlie
financials
if
you
get
something
that
s
grow
at
percent
a
year
that
s
at
least
tell
you
that
people
like
it
unless
you
re
do
something
illegal
and
what
we
be
do
wasn
t
illegal
immoral
or
fatten
it
be
just
plain
fun


shortly
before
the
private
placement
go
through
lee
and
our
sale
and
marketing
leader
come
to
me
and
say
why
don
t
we
just
call
the
company
dell
computer
corporation
which
be
in
fact
the
actual
incorporate
name
of
the
company
instead
of
pc
s
limited
it
s
be
work
out
great
in
the
uk
this
be
something
lee
have
want
to
do
for
a
while
we
d
have
several
minor
clash
about
it
i
knew
he
hat
our
generic
sound
name
and
he
knew
i
love
it
it
represent
my
baby
the
thing
i
d
start
out
with
in
dobie
now
make
million
of
dollar
in
sale
per
month
if
our
customer
like
it
why
change
it
i
be
leery
too
about
name
the
company
after
myself
it
could
be
see
as
an
act
of
vanity
and
vanity
really
wasn
t
part
of
my
makeup
and
there
be
something
else
something
i
couldn
t
talk
to
anybody
about
what
if
our
hot
start
up
cool
down
what
if
we
go
under
like
so
many
computer
company
in
the
mid
and
late
s
dell
computer
corporation
would
have
a
whole
different
connotation
then
i
kept
think
about
a
tech
entrepreneur
name
adam
osborne
who
in
the
early
s
have
come
out
with
a
portable
computer
call
the
osborne
the
machine
be
very
popular
for
a
while
until
he
announce
the
imminent
release
of
an
upgraded
model
the
executive
the
problem
be
that
the
release
wasn
t
imminent
enough
in
anticipation
of
the
new
computer
people
immediately
stop
buying
the
osborne
revenue
stop
flow
and
with
no
new
product
in
the
pipeline
and
a
lot
of
supplier
to
pay
mr
osborne
go
bankrupt
to
add
insult
to
injury
business
writer
dubbed
the
fiasco
the
osborne
effect
not
the
way
you
want
to
be
remember
if
my
fledgling
business
go
under
i
didn
t
want
to
even
imagine
anyone
talk
about
a
dell
effect
but
lee
and
the
others
kept
on
me
pc
s
limited
sound
down
market

sound
like

re

our
game
take
it
to
ibm
and
compaq

sound
like
we
re
play
in
the
same
league
they
wore
me
out
i
also

their
point

to
me
at
first
but
and
our
still
skyrocket
sale
didn
t
hurt
a
bit

to
seem
completely
natural

as
soon
as

i
stuffed
this
piece
of
paper
in
this
dictionary

kept
on
my
desk
and
forgot
about
it
my
dictionary
have
a
black
leather
cover
on
it
because
the
truth
be
i
be
a
little
embarrass
to
have
a
dictionary
on
my
desk
maybe
because
i
d
drop
out
of
ut
maybe
because
english
have
never
be
my
best
subject
but
now
and
then
i
d
hear
or
read
a
word
i
didn
t
know
the
meaning
of
and
i
be
always
curious
about
everything
so
i
d
look
the
word
up
in
my
secret
dictionary
and
one
day
not
long
after
buddy
come
by
i
be
look
up
a
word
intrinsic
or
concomitant
or
something
like
that
and
i
come
upon
the
piece
of
paper
with
susan
lieberman
s
name
and
number
on
it
and
i
decide
what
the
hell
and
call
her
up
and
ask
her
to
lunch
we
met
at
a
little
austin
bistro
call
chez
fred
and
i
saw
the
moment
she
walk
in
the
door
that
she
be
very
cute
and
blonde
and
athletic
look
so
that
be
nice
but
once
we
sat
down
and
start
to
talk
i
found
that
she
be
also
smart
and
warm
and
vivacious
despite
its
reputation
the
blind
date
thing
seem
to
be
work
out
just
fine
from
my
end
and
from
hers
as
susan
tell
the
story
she
be
impressed
by
the
fact
that
i
wore
a
suit
and
pull
out
her
chair
for
her
she
also
like
that
i
didn
t
brag
apparently
she
d
be
go
out
with
a
lot
of
braggy
guy
but
then
i
manage
to
throw
a
wrench
into
the
conversation
when
susan
ask
where
i
d
go
to
school
i
told
the
truth
that
i
d
go
to
ut
for
a
year
and
drop
out
to
start
a
computer
company
but
what
she
mainly
heard
be
the
drop
out
part
and
what
she
thought
at
that
moment
i
could
see
it
on
her
face
be
uh
oh
how
old
be
you
she
ask
back
in
those
day
with
my
chubby
cheek
big
glass
and
mop
of
curly
hair
i
ll
admit
i
be
on
the
boyish
look
side
but
i
think
susan
lieberman
may
have
thought
at
that
moment
that
she
be
have
lunch
with
a
nineteen
year
old
college
dropout
i
told
her
that
i
be
two
week
from
turn
twenty
three
oh
my
gosh
you
re
just
a
baby
she
say
it
come
out
of
me
before
i
have
a
chance
to
think
i
m
not
a
baby
i
ve
get
my
own
company
which
company
pc
s
limited
the
businesswoman
in

a
connection

she

about
the
warehouse
and
office
space

d

so

i
smile
and
say
yes
the
rest
of
the
lunch
go
fine
i
have
to
go
to
europe
for
a
week
to
visit
our
new
uk
office
and
look
into
the
possibility
of
opening
other
location
on
the
continent
when
i
get
back
i
call
susan
lieberman
again
and
ask
if
she
d
like
to

for
a
walk
along
the
barton
creek
trail
that
sunday
she
say

we
walk
and
talk
then
walk
and
talk
some
more
the
more
we
talk
the
more
we
found
we
have
in
common
when

and
talk


that
june
dell
file
to
go
public
and
immediately
after
filing
the
paper
we
get
the
kind
of
mail
a
little
company
never
want
to
get
from
a
big
company
a
certify
cease
and
desist
letter
from
ibm
dear
dell
computer
corporation
it
read
we
have
reason
to
believe
you
may
be
infringe
some
of
our
patent
it
be
a
shock
but
it
wasn
t
a
surprise
we
d
be
in
business
for
four
year
grow
from
a
one
man
company
to
a
multimillion
dollar
operation
and
we
have
create
all

of
ibm

recently
thanks
to
another
brilliant
new

the

in
their
late
issue
call
our
machine
fast
enough
to
burn
the
sand
off
a
desert
floor
that
be
very
high
praise
the
certify
letter
from
ibm
wasn
t
what
it
say
be
completely
correct
we
d
simply
be
move
too
fast
and
too
single
mindedly
to
think
about
apply
for
patent
on
any
of
the
product
we
be
develop
number
of
patent
held
by
international
business
machine
approximately
one
gazillion
number
of

held
by

zero
when
lee
kelley
and
i
get
on
a
plane
and
flew
north
to
meet
with
ibm
at
the
company
s
armonk
new
york
headquarters
it
felt
a
lot
like
be
call
to
the
principal
s
office
bad
than
that
at
a
point
when
we
be
desperate
for
money
the
private
placement
s
million
have
go
fast
to
supplier
r
d
our
ever
increase
payroll
a
lawsuit
from
big
blue
could
stop
our
ipo
in
its
track
and
maybe
stop
us
in
our
track
too


dell
be
now
the
seventh
large
manufacturer
of
pc
in
the
united
state
the
austin
real
estate
bust
have
allow
us
to
lease
an
entire
nine
story
stone
and
glass
tower
at
arboretum
boulevard
manufacturing
be
in
a
warehouse
building
in
the
braker
area
of
north
austin
yet
though
we
be
big
and
get
big
every
week
we
be
still
minuscule
compare
with
ibm
their
huge
campus
of
futuristic
look
building
spread
across
acre
of
perfectly
manicure
lawn
be
intimidate
to
say
the
least
even
the
interior
of
the
building
we
walk
into
seem
cold
sterile
daunt
all
the
men
there
be
almost
no
woman
in
sight
be
wear
the
uniform
dark
suit
white
shirt
and
red
necktie
nobody
have
facial
hair
a
far
cry
from
dress
down
austin
but
ibm
s
director
of
licensing
emmett
murtha
couldn
t
have
be
friendlier
he
smile
as
we
shook
hand
and
sat
down
to
afternoon
tea
serve
by
his
secretary
in
elegant
china
cup
why
shouldn
t
he
have
be
nice
he
have
us
totally
over
a
barrel
still
from
the
first
murtha
try
to
put
us
at
ease
he
didn
t
want
to
drive
us
out
of
business
he
say
he
be
just
ask
us
to
pay
a
small
fee
for
every
computer
we
ship
since
we
be
clearly
benefiting
from
the
use
of
ibm
technology
how
small
a
fee
i
ask
mr
murtha
smile
three
percent
he
say
lee
and
i
look
at
each
other
at
that
point
we
be
make
a
profit
of
about
five
percent
on
each
computer
we
sell
three
percent
be
a
huge
bite
in
theory
we
could
simply
pas
the
three
percent
along
to
the
customer
but
if
we
do
that
would
we
sell
as
many
machine
and
would
all
our
competitor
there
be
about
three
dozen
pc
maker
in
the
us
at
that
point
be
raise
their
price
too
be
ibm
get
three
percent
from
compaq
maybe
compaq
have
more
patent
than
we
have
that
wouldn
t
have
be
hard
probably
lee
kelley
and
i
be
all
think
the
same
thing
but
what
could
we
do
on
june
we
sign
a
licensing
agreement
with
ibm
under
which
we
be
permit
to
manufacture
and
sell
computer
compatible
with
ibm
s
xt
at
and
p
machine
in
return
we
would
pay
them
royalty
on
past
current
and
future
sale
of
machine
contain
technology
they
have
patent
it
be
a
big
bite
out
of
our
profit
but
we
figure
we
d
make
up
the
difference
somehow
on
june
our
initial
public
offering

of
the

of
week
later
of

i
d
forgotten
all
about
it
but
there
be
the
cup
on
the
living
room
rug
i
picked
it
up
and
the
scorpion
be
still
alive
those
thing
be
pretty
tough
but
everything
change
once
i
start
date
susan
lieberman

once
she
begin
stay
over
no
more
keg
party
no
more
plastic
plant
and
no
more
scorpion
the
only
way
i
could
talk
her
into
move
in
with
me
be
by
agree
to
get
a
cleaning
person
to
come
in
every
week
and
change
the
home
lab
into
an
exercise
room
complete
with
stairmaster
an
odd
thing
start
happen
after

little
while

have
drawn
a
good
deal
of
attention
include
in
the
local
press
and
now
and
then
i
begin
to
notice
car
drive
by
my
house
and
slow
down
to
have
a
look
sometimes
someone
would
actually
park
in
my
driveway
and
ring
the
doorbell
all
they
want
be
to
shake
my
hand
and
say

very
friendly
and
well
intentioned
until
one
person
wasn
t

s
a
story
for
later
that
july
soon
after
we
go

else
rang
my
doorbell

in
itself
wasn
t
remarkable
several
people
from

street
but
glenn
henry
didn
t
just
work
for
ibm
he
be
an
ibm
fellow

be
a
distinction
of
the
high

it
be
an
important
job
one
that

make
him
well
off
enough
to
be
able
to
own
a
nice
house
in
this
nice
part
of
town
he
later
told
me
that
when
i
first
move
in
rumor
have
flown
around
the
neighborhood
that
a
twenty
one
year
old
probably
a
drug
dealer
have
just
bought
the
big
house
on

why
be
glenn
henry
ring
my
doorbell
that
july
afternoon
it
turn
out
that
he
d
just
read
about
our
ipo
in
the
austin
american
statesman
i
d
like
to
come

for
you
he
told
me
i
invite
him
in
for
a
cup
of
coffee
we
sat
down
and
talk
glenn
be
an
engineer
and
engineer
aren
t
prone
to
dramatic
gesture
so
offering
to
jump
ship
and
work
for
me
be
a
very
big
deal
he
have
a
wife
and
a
kid
and
a
mortgage
and
he
have
a
very
secure
gig

have
be
at
ibm
for
over
twenty
year
his
wife
really
want
him
to
stay
put
but
as
we
spoke
i
could
see
he
felt
trap
in
the
arid
culture
that
i
sense
so
strongly
when
we
have
our
meeting
with
mr
murtha
in
armonk
as
glenn
described
it
to
me
all
the
other
ibm
fellow
as
well
as
ibm
management
look
down
their
nose
at
the
pc
his
bos
a
vice
president
at
the
company
thought
the
pc
would
make
a
great
terminal
to
a
mainframe
period
glenn
on
the
other
hand
saw
the
personal
computer
as
a
game
changer
at
the
time
there
be
maybe
a
couple
of
million
pc
in
the
world
he
saw
that
number
grow
to
billion
as
do
i
the
more
we
talk
the
more
i
saw
how
closely
align
glenn
henry
be
with
our
goal
by
the
time
we
finish
our
coffee
i
d
invite
him
to
come
join
our
merry
band
of
renegade
now
close
to
a
thousand
strong
and
head
up
our
research
and
development
team


mile
to
opportunity
that
be
the
cheeky
caption
on
the
billboard
we
put
right
outside
the
houston
headquarters
of
our
archrival
compaq
under
the
caption
to
drive
the

home
be
a
big
arrow
point
west
toward
austin
and
to
seal
the
deal
our
corporate
logo
and
a
number
of
their
people
be
follow
the
arrow
and
like
glenn
henry
come
to
join
our
rebel
band
many
more
new
hire
come
from
compaq
to
us
than
the
other
way
around
just
the
way
i
like
it
i
love
the
competition
in
our
field
whether
it
be
versus
rod
canion
at
compaq
or
bill
hayden
at
compuadd
or
ted
waitt
at
gateway
play
nice
but
win
especially
versus
compaq
they
d
start
out
a
couple
year
before
us
with
a
venture
capital
investment
of
million
from
a
guy
name
ben
rosen
as
contrast
with
our
my
they
have
a
great
democratic
corporate
culture
there
be
no
reserve
parking
space
even
for
the
ceo
at
their
silicon
valley
style
campus
in
the
wood
outside
houston
they
have
supersmart
engineer
powerful
r
d
and
a
special
partnership
with
intel
every
advance
in
microprocessor
where
intel
enjoy
a
virtual
monopoly
go
to
compaq
first
yet
compaq
have
no
price
advantage
their
operating
cost
be
percent
of
revenue
as
contrast
with
our
lean
and
mean
percent
they
sell
through
retail
store
only
and
though
their
pc
be
famously
well
engineer
and
reliable
they
be
also
expensive
we
knew
we
could
beat
them
on
price
and
with
our
build
to
order
model
on
flexibility
our
field
service
operation
allow
us
to
go
head
to
head
with
them
on
reliability
as
well
we
d
really
establish
a
place
in
a
crowd
field
we
be
the
cheeky
outsider
with
the
killer
business
model
i
didn
t
mind
it
a
bit
when
business
week
call
us
the
hottest
little
computer
maker
in
texas
and
our
sassy
ad
reflect
the
david
versus
goliath
theme
advertising
be
crucial
to
us
i
knew
from
personal
experience
how
much
attention
tech
people
paid
to
the
ad
in
pc
magazine
and
pc
world
and
info
world
our
early
advertisement
create
by
a
small
local
agency
and
begin
with
austin
newspaper
then
branching
out
to
national
outlet
be
very
straightforward
here
we
be
pc
s
limited
we
make
good
stuff
please
buy
it
but
shortly
before
the
private
placement
just
after
we
change
our
name
we
decide
it
be
time
to
lose
the
down
market
mail
order
image
for
good
hire
a
world
class
ad
agency
would
be
expensive
but
lee
and
i
deem
the
expense
to
be
worth
it
in
february
we
sign
with
hal
riney
partner
the
feisty
san
francisco
agency
that
have
create
attention
get
national
advertising
for
bartles
jaymes
wine
cooler
and
gallo
wine
we
set
an
ad
budget
of
million
with
riney
and
they
do
some
nice
spot
for
us
but
ultimately
we
be
a
mismatch
from
the
begin
riney
want
to
create
a
folksy
corporate
identity
for
us
cowboy
western
since
we
be
in
austin
that
felt
limit
if
not
just
plain
wrong
for
the
world
market
we
d
enter
we
didn
t
wear
ten
gallon
hat
and
tony
lama
boot
to
work
and
we
didn
t
want
our
customer
to
think
we
do
when
we
part
way
with
riney
we
knew
there
be
only
one
agency
for
us
the
award

of
chiat

have
create

include
the
semi
infamous
but
highly
effective
spot
that
ran
during
the
super
bowl
we
more
than
double
our
advertising
budget
when
we
sign
with
chiat
day
but
i
think
the
result
be
very
much
worth
it
a
print
ad
they
create
for
us

the

but
with

nearly

every

it
wasn
t
so
crazy
to
start
think
about
the

after

we
open

it
also
contain
a

of
noteworthy
failure
project
olympic
be
our
first
attempt
at
the
server
business
and
it
be
a
highly
complicate
technical
development
we
design
our
own
silicon
chip
for
a
storage
system
call
a
raid
array
redundant
array
of
independent
disk
we
built
server
with
multiple
microprocessor
but
the
project
be
way
too
ambitious
and
it
didn
t
work
we
also
have
an
inventory
planning
crisis
that
year
we
d
design
a
motherboard
that
lack
flexibility
in
its
memory
configuration
and
when
the
industry
standard
for
memory
chip
advanced
we
be
stuck
with
too
much
old
inventory
as
well
as
a
product
we
couldn
t
deliver
profitably
a
bad
stumble
but
dare
to
fail
be
the
only
path
to
meaningful
growth
as
eleanor
roosevelt
say
you
must
do
the
thing
you
think
you
cannot
do
then
and
at
every
step
along
the
way
every
failure
and
setback
make
me
and
our
company
strong
and
more
resilient
out
of
the
flop
of
olympic
we
developed
a
powerful
engineering
muscle
one
that
allow
us
to
quickly
repurpose
that
server
architecture
into
a
new
line
of
ibm
compatible
computer
and
the
planning
crisis
taught
us
how
to
be
much
more
agile
and
efficient
in
our
inventory
management
and
speak
personally
contain
my
big
success
of
all
one
that
resonates
to
this
minute
as
our
company
grow
i
d
become
friendly
with
both
bill
gate
with
whom
of
course
we
do
a
lot
of
business
and
steve
job
both
about
ten
year
old
than
me
and
both
guy
for
whom
i
have
great
professional
admiration
but
bill
and
steve
share
one
key
characteristic
that
i
didn
t
want
to
emulate
both
be
then
single
seemingly
married
to
their
respective
business
i
really
didn
t
want
to
wake
up
in
ten
year
and
find
myself
without
a
wife
and
family
and
so
on
october
with
my
whole
family
and
many
of
my
coworkers
present
and
with
lee
walker
as
my
best
man
i
married
susan
lieberman
and
begin
the
happiest
and
most
meaningful
journey
of
my
life
i
ve
achieve
some
pretty
big
thing
in
business
but
they
all
pale
in
comparison
with
the
achievement
of
marry
susan
and
raise
our
four
child
together


the
rosy
glow
i
be
feel
extend
into
the
begin
of
when
inc
magazine
name
me
its
first
entrepreneur
of
the
year
a
great
big
honor
for
a
not
quite
twenty
five
year
old
lee
walker
say
some
very
nice
thing
about
me
for
the
accompany
piece
and
know
that
lee
be
as
tough
mind
as
he
be
warmhearted
i
understood
that
he
meant
every
word
what
michael
dell
do
he
say
be
so
natural
to
him
and
flow
so
spontaneously
from
him
that
it
look
as
if
he
take
a
low
key
approach
he
have
so
clear
a
vision
of
where
he
be
head
that
he
can
rise
above
the
background
noise
and
avoid
the
pitfall
that
typically
take
entrepreneur
down
lee
be
also
be
modest
he
be
responsible
for
get
us
past
any
number
of
say
pitfall
but
as
winter
turn
to
spring
he
told
me
it
be
time
for
him
to
go
be
president
of
dell
computer
have
be
a
five
to
nine
job

later

require
hard
personnel
decision
financial
attention
trade
offs
strategic
direction
country
by
country
implementation
and
endless
domestic
tactical
operational
issue
i
have
forgotten
that
i
hadn
t
want
to
do
this
in
the
first
place
i
get
caught
up
in
the
richness
of
a
multidimensional
puzzle
get
swept
up
in
the
competitive
fray
of
defeat
ibm
and
compaq
i
forgot
that
once
upon
a
time
great
clump
of
my
hair
fell
out
and
my
back
ache
terribly
when
i
be
start
my
own
business
michael
and
i
be
such
different
personality
he
be
one
of
those
business
people
who
thrive
on
the
stress
of
international
high
tech
competition
i
be
not
that
impossibly
complicate
arena
give
him
energy
it
have
beaten
me
down
to
the
point
that
i
wasn
t
physically
or
emotionally
strong
enough
to
continue
lee
s
tip
point
be
international
travel
over
the
last
couple
of
year
he
d
go
to
canada
england
france
germany
and
sweden
to
help
get
our
overseas
subsidiary
up
and
run
in
addition
to
his
responsibility
at
dell

in
march
he
go
to
visit
our
uk
and
german
operation
then
spent
eleven
hour
fly
home
to
austin
and
immediately
he
begin
experience
excruciate
pain
in
his
low
back
somewhere
in
his
travel
he
d
picked
up
a
hard
to
treat
form
of
meningitis
it
be
time
for
him
to
let
go
there
be
tear
from
both
of
us
when
lee
say
goodbye
we
d
be
through
a
ton
together
we
d
accomplish
a
ton
too
i
d
also
do
a
lot
of
grow
up
in
those
four
year
and
though
i
knew
go
on
without
him
would
be
difficult
i
felt
more
than
confident
that
i
could
take
it
from
there

redemption
the
last
day
of
july
be

with
the
august

ok
with

to
set
a
new
later
record
date
as
we
saw
it
move
the
record
date

allow
the

arbitrageur
that
have
recently
bet
on
the
buyout
to
vote
their
share
for

the

firm
on
the
strict
voting
standard
no
show

no
the

by

on
july
dell

fell
more
than
percent

as
low
as
their
low

since
news
of
the

broke
on
january
highlight
uncertainty
among
shareholder
about
the

s
prospect
in
fact
the
deal
be
perilously
close
to
fall
apart
the
special

have
let
us
know
in
no
uncertain
term
that
if
we
still
didn

carl
icahn
sent
yet
another
open
letter
to
our
board
and
stockholder
imaginatively
title
let
the
desperate
dell
debacle
die
it
urge
the

to
spurn
silver

and
me
finally
and
absolutely
by
negotiate
an
undervalue
freeze
out
merger
push
relentlessly
to
have
it
approve
by
even
go
so
far
as
to
try
to
waive
one
of
the
most
important
stockholder
protection
in
the
merger
agreement
the
voting
standard
michael
dell
have
reveal
all
we
need
to
know
and
to
be
honest
we
fear
to
what
end
he
will
go
to
keep
dell
under
his
control
if
and
when
his
freeze
out
merger
be
finally
allow
to
be
reject
specifically
will
he
try
to
purchase
additional
stock
to
far
increase
his
percent
position
in
the
company
in
an
attempt
to
ensure
he
keep
control
of
the
company
at
the
annual
meeting
the
dell
board
must
consider
this
question
seriously
and
should
prevent
michael
dell
from
buying
vote
by
buying
share
what
we
view
as
the
ill
effect
of
michael
dell
s
influence
have
be
broadly
felt
since
michael
dell
return
as
ceo
the
stock
have
drop
from
to
this
morning
s
price
of
the
freeze
out
merger
be
his
idea
all
along
and
it
have
be
show
to
be
an
unpopular
one
the
board
should
not
aid
him
by
permit
him
to
increase
his
influence
at
dell
this
be
a
red
herring
icahn
would
have
know
that
begin
on
february
i
and
all
the
other
affiliate
stockholder
include
susan
and
everybody
else
in
my
family
have
be
under
a
standstill
obligation
we
d
agree
not
to
buy
any
more
dell
share
during
this
negotiation
but
in
mention
the
voting
standard
one
of
the
most
important
stockholder
protection
he
be
zero
in
on
the
stick
point
between
the
special
committee
and
me
and
encourage
the
committee
to
hold
fast
on
the
issue
and
if
they
do
hold
fast
one
of
two
possible
outcome
would
be
assure
either
silver
lake
and
i
would
somehow
have
to
increase
our
best
and
final
offer
in
order
to
get
the
committee
to
budge
thus
increase
the
value
of
icahn
s
share
or
we
would
simply
lose
the
vote
and
the
deal
would
die
now
if
this
deal
die
dell
stock
would
probably
plunge
severely
decrease
the
value
of
icahn
s
share
and
make
the
company
vulnerable
in
all
kind
of
way
with
our
annual
shareholder
meeting
and
board
election
come
up
in
october
icahn
s
threat
to
replace
the
board
and
me
would
have
real
teeth
meanwhile
our
second
quarter
earnings
have
fall
by
percent
do
icahn
really
want
to
kill
the
deal
at
his
dell
share
expense
just
to
gain
control
of
a
devalue
company
unlikely
i
thought
he
be
bluffing
try
to
get
us
to
raise
our
price
by
raise
the
specter
of
his
old
company
strip
way
in
any
case
uncertainty
be
hang
in
the
air
like
a
bad
smell
on
the
morning
of
the
thirty
first
egon
and
i
phone
the
special
committee
alex
mandl
have
to
attend
to
a
family
matter
so
we
spoke
with
ken
duberstein
whom
alex
have
deputize
what
ll
it
take
to
make
this
happen
we
ask
a
high
offer
ken
say
that
be
easy
to
say
but
not
so
easy
to
do
every
penny
add
to
our
offer
meant
million
more
and
while
egon
be
all
in
his
partner
have
drawn
the
line
be
as
high
as
they
be
willing
to
go
now
at
this
point
you
may
well
be
think
well
michael
s
a
rich
guy
why
couldn
t
he
just
pull
a
couple
of
hundred
million
out
of
his
pocket
and
set
this
thing
to
rest
at
last
a
couple
of
reason
from
the
begin
that
be
from
the
infancy
of
this
idea
egon
and
i
first
talk
about
as
we
take
that
walk
in
hawaii
i
knew
that
it
be
crucial
for
me
to
have
a
partner
on
the
go
private
for
me
to
have
set
the
price
on
a
buyout
of
dell
all
by
myself
would
ve
be
innately
conflictual
i
need
a
partner
as
well
as
a
special
committee
of
independent
board
member
to
make
sure
the
stockholder
get
the
best
deal
possible
so
for
me
to
simply
throw
in
a
bunch
of
extra
money
as
the
buyout
be
come
down
to
the
wire
would
be
bad
optic
to
say
the
least
it
would
make
silver
lake
suddenly
look
like
less
than
a
full
partner
in
addition
my
own
credibility
be
on
the
line
i
have
go
on
television
and
say
that
be
our
best
and
final
offer
to
suddenly
say
okay
here
s
our
new
best
and
final
offer
would
not
be
a
good
look
yet
silver
lake
and
i
also
knew
that
whether
we
bought
the
company
for
or
a
share
really
wasn
t
go
to
matter
five
year
from
now
in
five
year
the
company
would
be
worth
either
substantially
more
or
substantially
less
a
few
cent
difference
today
wasn
t
go
to
affect
that
outcome
egon
and
i
confer
and
what
we
come
up
with
be
this
we
would
add
a
special
dividend
of
eight
cent
to
our
offer
bring
it
to
a
share
by
reduce
the
price
of
the
share
i
be
roll
into
the
deal
in
addition
if
the
whole
deal
fell
through
due
to
a
new
alternative
transaction
silver
lake
agree
to
accept
a
reduction
in
its
breakup
fee
from
million
to
million
but
in
return
for
those
concession
we
say
the
special
committee
would
have
to
accede
to
change
the
voting
standard
we
call
back
with
our
revise
proposal
ken
say
they
would
talk
about
it
and
let
us
know
in
a
couple
of
hour
duberstein
phone
us
that
even
raise
the
dividend
to
thirteen
cent
and
you
ve
get
a
deal
he
say
with
a
new
voting
standard
with
a
new
voting
standard
i
look
at
egon
he
nod
we
be
both

this
be
a
mitzvah

a
truly
kind
considerate
ethical
deed

happy
about
it

the

acceptance
of
the
buyout
term
stood
and
the
annual
meeting
be
held
a
month
later
his
chance
for
win
the

would
wither
on

that
under
delaware
law
a
company
s
annual
meeting
have
to
be
held
within
thirteen
month
of
the
previous
one
and
our
previous

have
take
place
in
july
the
old
greenmailer
be
up
to
one
of
his
old
trick
make
a
big
enough
nuisance
of
himself
that
his
target
in
this
case
silver
lake
and
i
would
be
force
to
buy
out
his
share
at
a
premium
to
make
him
go
away
if
the

told
the

which
of

listen
eagerly
hop
the
slap
fight
between
carl
and
me

go
on
for
as
long
as
possible
dell
stockholder
and
of
course
especially
carl
icahn
would
suffer
irreparable
harm
because
as
the
renegotiate
record
date
and
voting
standard
now
stood
our
buyout
be
nearly
certain
to
be
approve
through
an
unfair
vote
it
be
pure
self
serve
b
but
it
stir
up
just
the
kind
of
chaos
he
relish
it
s
possible
the
new
york
time
write
that
a
delaware
judge
could
rule
in
mr
icahn
s
favor
by
either
overturn
the
change
in
voting
rule
or
compelling
an
annual
meeting
to
be
held
sooner
than
october
that
could
thrust
mr
dell
s
takeover
bid
once
more
into
the
murk
of
uncertainty
i
pin
my
hope
on
the
judge
who
have
take
the
case
chancellor
leo
strine
who
have
previously
praise
the
special
committee
and
express
healthy
skepticism
about
icahn
s
proposal
still
icahn
wasn
t
give
up
the
war
regard
dell
be
far
from
over
he
declare
on
august
that
day
our
stock
rise
percent
show
that
even
if
some
stockholder
be
unhappy
with
the
deal
a
lot
more
thought
it
be
good
news
three
day
later
icahn
disclose
that
he
have
bought
an
additional
million
share
from
southeastern
bring
his
personal
stake
in
dell
to
almost
percent
he
continued
to
attack
the
special
committee
cite
their
self
grant
imperial
status
charge
them
with
try
to
ram
through
a
go
private
transaction
but
chancellor
strine
refuse
to
be
hurry
and
he
didn
t
look
kindly
on
icahn
s
suit
at
the
august
hearing
he
described
carl
s
charge
against
the
board
as
an
adjectival
assault
that
doesn
t
have
noun
and
verb
that
add
up
to
colorable
claim
and
in
a
twenty
six
page
opinion
strine
review
the
special
committee
s
conduct
very
favorably
commend
its
stringent
deal
protection
the
go
shop
period
with
its
aggressive
marketing
the
expense
policy
that
have
offer
to
reimburse
icahn
for
his
due
diligence
the
committee
s
complete
readiness
to
turn
aside
my
offer
if
a
superior
bid
emerge
the
reasonable
and
later
reduce
break
fee
the
judge
also
note
devastatingly
that
he
look
with
some
skepticism
on
icahn
s
big
purchase
of
southeastern
s
share
note
that
he
have
never
actually
make
a
superior
bid
to
buy
dell
instead
hold
out
smoke
and
mirror
promise
of
a
leveraged
recapitalization
while
the
special
committee
do
the
heavy
lift
of
extract
an
additional
twenty
three
cent
a
share
from
silver
lake
and
me
if
icahn
have
actually
come
up
with
a
superior
offer
chancellor
strine
say
it
would
ve
cause
the
committee
to
dance
in
the
street
could
icahn
as
some
insider
hint
have
bully
southeastern
into
sell
him
their
dell
share
at
a
loss
threaten
to
walk
away
from
the
battle
if
they
refuse
own
a
big
block
of
discount
stock
would
give
him
a
nice
insurance
policy
if
we
won
especially
because
most
of
his
previous
purchase
have
be
above
the
deal
price
for
good
measure
the
judge
say
that
he
wasn
t
inclined
to
move
up
the
date
of
our
annual
meeting
from
october
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
chancellor
strine
say
how
the
court
would
order
a
meeting
much
in
advance
of
the
one
the
board
have
already
set
the
court
be
not
go
to
be
drawn
into
a
tactical
game
whereby
it
try
to
advantage
one
party
or
another
i
told
you
i
love
this
guy
for
the
dell
buyout
this
be
truly
an
end
to
the
litigation
threat
the
time
write
this
essentially
leaf
everything
with
the
shareholder
vote
mr
icahn
southeastern
management
and
the
other
buyout
opponent
will
have
to
fight
this
battle
base
on
the
new
rule
the
dell
board
have
negotiate
the
tide
be
against
them
though
the
vote
be
still
likely
to
be
a
nail
biter


i
don
t
bite
my
nail
but
i
do
pace
i
do
my
best
think
on
my
foot
and
i
put
some
mileage
on
my
shoe
throughout
this
whole
period
susan
be
still
the
only
person
outside
dell
and
silver
lake
i
could
talk
to
about
what
be
go
on
and
just
like
at
the
begin
of
our
courtship
we
walk
and
talk
at
home
in
austin
or
at
our
ranch
on
lake
austin
we
d
go
out
for
a
two
or
three
hour
hike
and
hash
through
everything
that
be
go
on
with
our
family
and
the
go
private
when
it
come
to
business
susan
be
far
more
than
a
sound
board
she
be
a
businesswoman
herself
and
i
confer
with
her
at
every
turn
in
the
road
in
this
sixteen
month
process
and
when
it
come
to
our
family
she
be
and
be
my
life
partner
my
other
half
our
four
child
be
all
at
different
stage
of
their
development
with
different
joy
and
problem
so
there
be
a
lot
to
discus
there
too
you
re
only
as
happy
as
your
least
happy
child
the
clich
say
and
just
because
it
s
a
clich
doesn
t
mean
it
s
not
true
and
then
there
be
my
mother
in
the
summer
of
it
look
like
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
we
d
lose
her
so
susan
and
i
would
go
to
houston
to
see
her
as
often
as
we
could
which
in
the
thick
of
my
business
situation
wasn
t
as
often
as
i
would
ve
like
only
every
other
weekend
or
so
my
mom
and
susan
have
an
exceptionally
close
relationship
and
susan
have
thrown
herself
into
the
project
of
make
her
as
comfortable
as
possible
and
we
be
fortunate
to
have
the
resource
to
do
a
lot
for
her
right
in
my
mom
and
dad
s
house
round
the
clock
nursing
state
of
the
art
hospital
bed
and
medical
equipment
a
chef
but
cancer
be
a
relentless
force
no
matter
how
many
resource
you
throw
at
it
and
sometimes
the
idea
that
we
be
do
all
we
could
for
mom
wasn
t
console
enough
though
a
big
business
victory
be
in
sight
that
august
any
sense
of
imminent
triumph
i
might
ve
have
be
thrown
into
the
shade
by
deep
and
powerful
force
i
be
unable
to
control
my
compartmentalize
skill
be
really
get
a
workout
during
those
day


on
september
icahn
concede
in
a
final
could
it
really
be
open
letter
to
our
shareholder
it
be
pretty
bitter
state
law
deal
with
corporate
governance
often
favor
incumbent
corporate
board
and
management
and
be
weak
in
many
area
while
we
must
abide
by
these
law
we
believe
that
they
can
and
must
be
change
and
as
usual
pretty
creative
the
dell
board
like
so
many
board
in
this
country
reminds
me
of
clark
gable
s
last
word
in
go
with
the
wind
they
simply
don
t
give
a
damn
speak
about
the
adjourn
july
and
july
meeting
he
say
we
won
or
at
least
thought
we
won
but
when
the
board
realize
that
they
lose
the
vote
they
simply
ignore
the
outcome
even
in
a
dictatorship
when
the
ruling
party
loses
an
election
and
then
ignores
its
outcome
it
attempt
to
provide
a
plausible
reason
to
justify
their
action
andrew
bary
at
barron
s
wisely
observe
in
an
action
worthy
of
vladimir
putin
dell
postpone
a
vote
schedule
for
last
thursday
on
michael
dell
s
propose
buyout
of
the
company
when
it
become
apparent
that
there
be
insufficient
shareholder
support
for
the
deal
the
board
simply
rely
on
the
usual
business
judgment
catchall
and
delaware
law
to
uphold
their
action
we
jokingly
ask
what
s
the
difference
between
dell
and
a
dictatorship
the
answer
most
function
dictatorship
only
need
to
postpone
the
vote
once
to
win
we
have
determine
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
win
the
battle
on
september
we
have
therefore
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
will
not
pursue
additional
effort
to
defeat
the
michael
dell
silver
lake
proposal
although
we
still
oppose
it
and
will
move
to
seek
appraisal
right
i
realize
that
some
stockholder
will
be
disappointed
that
we
do
not
fight
on
however
over
the
last
decade
mainly
through
activism
we
have
enhance
stockholder
value
in
many
company
by
billion
of
dollar
we
do
not
accomplish
this
by
wag
battle
that
we
thought
we
would
lose
michael
dell
silver
lake
wag
a
hard
fought
battle
and
accord
to
chancellor
strine
the
action
by
dell
be
within
the
delaware
law
we
therefore
congratulate
michael
dell
and
i
intend
to
call
him
to
wish
him
good
luck
he
may
need
it


the
charge
that
the
board
have
act
dictatorially
be
another
icahn
invention
by
the
time
of
the
first
adjournment
july
the
special
committee
have
decide
our
offer
be
best
for
the
company
and
crucially
have
not
receive
a
superior
offer
from
carl
the
same
be
true
on
july
when
the
second
shareholder
meeting
be
adjourn
due
to
lack
of
support
vote
the
committee
have
exert
all
its
strict
control
and
be
operating
entirely
within
the
rule
establish
at
the
begin
of
this
process
its
refusal
to
adjourn
a
third
time
prove
its
impartiality
but
i
ll
say
this
for
icahn
he
really
do
call
michael
it
be
a
hard
fight
but
you
won
fair
and
square
he
say
conveniently
forget
all
the
time
he
d
insult
my
leadership
and
by
extension
me
personally
accuse
me
in
the
most
public
way
possible
of
sheer
incompetence
not
to
mention
all
kind
of
corporate
finagle
and
malfeasance
thanks
i
told
him
though
what
i
be
really
think
be
you
come
after
this
company
the
thing
that
mean
more
to
me
than
anything
in
the
world
except
my
family
and
you
lose
pal
thanks
for
nothing
i
really
do
wish
you
ton
of
luck
in
your
new
phase
he
continued
i
ve
say
from
the
begin
of
this
that
i
think
you
re
do
some
very
excite
thing
at
dell
i
thanked
him
again
still
wonder
if
he
have
any
idea
what
our
company
really
do
i
listen
for
a
few
more
minute
as
he
go
on
and
on
about
god
know
what
the
prospect
for
ibm
and
hewlett
packard
how
undervalue
he
thought
apple
be
in
a
move
that
reek
of
d
j
vu
he
d
just
bought
a
billion
stake
in
the
company
and
be
already
give
tim
cook
a
hard
time
his
son
s
investment
the
weather
whatever
i
be
really
only
half
listen
throw
in
a
yup
or
an
uh
huh
from
time
to
time
and
then
carl
be
congratulate
me
once
more
and
our
one
side
conversation
be
over
i
sincerely
hop
never
to
see
or
hear
from
him
again
then
again
with
carl
icahn
you
never
knew


the
one
thing
he
be
happy
about
icahn
write
in
that
letter
be
that
all
his
effort
have
manage
to
squeeze
a
high
price
for
dell
stockholder
he
be
too
modest
to
mention
that
as
the
big
unaffiliated
stockholder
of
all
he
have
squeeze
out
a
very
nice
chunk
of
change
for
himself
among
the
many
lie
carl
told
along
the
way
be
this
claim
that
he
would
seek
appraisal
right
he
knew
full
well
that
do
so
could
hang
up
his
share
in
adjudication
for
year
and
so
the
moment
our
deal
be
do
he
cashed
out
immediately
make
a
profit
in
the
ten
of
million
that
would
be
a
lot
of
money
to
most
people
but
i
m
sure
it
left
icahn
feel
bitter
and
angry
at
the
thought
that
he
could
have
make
so
much
more


september
be
a
great
day
in
round
rock
with
the
absent
shareholder
vote
now
merely
absent
rather
than
counting
against
us
the
special
meeting
take
all
of
fifteen
minute
to
come
to
a
verdict
percent
of
the
share
voting
on
the
deal
not
include
share
i
and
other
affiliate
own
vote
in
favor
of
our
buyout
afterward
everybody
who
d
be
work
so
hard
to
make
this
happen
be
jubilant
we
re
the
world
s
large
start
up
i
told
the
press
it
be
a
line
that
just
popped
out
of
my
mouth
but
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
truer
it
seem
egon
compare
the
buyout
to
a
pulp
fiction
like
adrenaline
shot
to
the
heart
the
outcome
be
expect
the
wall
street
journal
say
conveniently
forget
all
the
discourage
comment
about
the
buyout
and
me
it
have
run
but
it
follow
month
of
angst
well
that
part
be
true
enough
there
be
still
doubter
standard
poor
s
cut
our
credit
rating
to
junk
status
on
concern
that
the
almost
billion
in
debt
we
d
take
on
would
reduce
our
ability
to
invest
in
our
various
new
business
but
cfo
brian
gladden
reassure
analyst
that
our
revenue
stream
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
pay
down
our
obligation
and
debt
as
an
integral
part
of
corporate
transaction
isn
t
always
completely
understood
even
by
sophisticated
business
commentator
yes
debt
on
your
credit
card
and
spending
beyond
your
mean
can
leave
you
with
expensive
payment
for
year
that
s
bad
but
when
use
thoughtfully
to
finance
the
purchase
of
productive
asset
debt
be
an
important
and
necessary
part
of
how
the
economy
work
and
it
can
create
tremendous
growth
and
opportunity
i
don
t
often
read
the
comment
section
on
the
new
york
time
website
s
dealbook
page
but
at
this
dramatic
moment
i
couldn
t
help
take
a
look
there
be
some
interest
exchange
one
jgny
of
patchogue
ny
opine
michael
dell
should
run
and
keep
his
billion
this
be
ego
plane
sic
and
simple
dell
like
hp
be
in
the
toilet
with
pc
s
and
they
have
no
real
benefit
to
jump
on
the
tablet
at
this
late
point
they
be
still
fairly
large
with
business
pc
s
but
that
pool
be
shrink
with
a
continual
small
economy
and
no
real
expansion
in
the
private
sector
but
craig
from
texas
have
a
sharp
reply

not
follow
very
closely
dell
may
continue
to
bring
forward
product
like
pc
s
and
tablet
but
the
whole
point
of
the
go
private
initiative
be
to
take
the
focus
off
of
those
product
and
allow
more
investment
into
enterprise
software
and
hardware

like
iphones

clueless
typically
about
what
it
take

run
all
the
back
end
in
the

to
which
their
apps
connect
and
how
they
connect
and
do
it
securely
and
remember
their

that
back
end
be
where

a
considerable
foothold

the
buyout
will
lead
to
them
much
more
quickly
fill
in
the
gap
of
their
product
portfolio
and
reduce
their
dependence
on
the
shrink
pc
market
not
sure
whether
craig
from
texas
be
one
of

a
big
round
of
applause
and
i
felt
the
little
hair
on
the
back
of
my
neck
stand
up
i
thought
about
the
ordeal
of
the
last
seven
month
one
of
the
hardest
part
of
which
be
the
impossibility
of
discuss
with
anyone
outside
of
a
small
inner
circle
what
be
really
go
on
it
be
easy
to
feel
alone
during
those
month
i
thought
of
all
the
time
i
stood
before
similar
crowd
of
our
people
here
in
round
rock
and
around
the
world
try
my
hardest
to
reassure
them
without
say
too
much
ask
ten
of
thousand
of
our
team
member
to
have
faith
that
everything
would
turn
out
all
right
they
have
trust
me
stuck
with
me
and
now
i
want
to
tell
them
all
how
very
much
that
meant
to
me
i
want
every
last
dell
team
member
to
feel
as
excite
as
i
felt
about
where
we
be
go
from
here
i
also
want
them
to
meet
our
partner
who
share
our
excitement
i
introduce
egon
who
spoke
by
video
from
silver
lake
headquarters
in
california
this
isn
t
really
a
transformation
he
say
you
ve
already
do
the
transformation
that
be
the
risky
part
now
be
the
part
where
you
ve
get
to
grow
and
be
on
offense
which
over
time
will
create
more
opportunity
over
a
longer
period
we
don
t
look
at
thing
through
a
short
term
lens
but
rather
what
s
the
fundamental
intrinsic
value
of
what
s
be
built
and
create
here
and
it
s
irreplaceable
it
s
not
like
own
beachfront
property
it
s
like
own
the
island
go
forward
egon
say
we
in
the
team
would
have
all
kind
of
idea
and
a
lot
of
them
would
turn
out
to
be
bad
but
that
be
great
the
important
thing
be
we
now
have
the
freedom
to
try
thing

about

our
focus
from

a
day
or
so
after
the
vote
i
tweet
this
quote
which
i
love
it
be
not
the
critic
who
count
not
the
man
who
point
out
how
the
strong
man
stumble
or
where
the
doer
of
deed
could
have
do
them
well
the
credit
belongs
to
the
man
who
be
actually
in
the
arena
whose
face
be
mar
by
dust
and
sweat
and
blood
who
strives
valiantly
who
errs
who
come
up
short
again
and
again
because
there
be
no
effort
without
error
and
shortcoming
but
who
do
actually
strive
to
do
the
deed
who
know
the
great
enthusiasm
the
great
devotion
who
spends
himself
in
a
worthy
cause
who
at
the
best
know
in
the
end
the
triumph
of
high
achievement
and
who
at
the
bad
if
he
fails
at
least
fails
while
dare
greatly
so
that
his
place
shall
never
be
with
those
cold
and
timid
soul
who
know
neither
victory
nor
defeat

at

all
of

if
we
will
be
able
to

return
of

i
knew
that
it

as
why
do
this
early
attempt

enter

fail
at
the
time
i
just
couldn
t
figure
it
out
it
be
incredibly
frustrate
we
have
all
these
great
engineer
we
be
create
superb
product
on
paper
our
server
initiative
look
foolproof
but
over
time
i
realize
what
we
d
do
wrong
our
business
be
skyrocket
not
just
because
of
the
excellence
of
our
product
but
also
because
of
what
have
driven
our
success
in
the
first
place
our
direct
connection
with
our
customer
from
the
sale
experience
through
delivery
and
afterward
technical
support
and
in
this
case
we
d
fall
down
on
the
job
the
te
and
the
te
be
superb
machine
so
we
thought
our
name
alone
the
reputation
we
d
built
as
a
brand
would
have
customer
clamor
for
them
but
the
customer
who
be
buying
this
class
of
product
medium
size
and
big
corporation
bank
and
government
agency
didn
t
trust
us
yet
when
it
come
to
this
product
everyone
knew
we
be
very
good
at
make
pc
but
where
server
be
concerned
we
have
almost
no
track
record
and
that
fact
emphasize
the
second
problem
the
price
difference
between
our
server
and
compaq
s
seem
suspiciously
big
we
be
charge
too
little
as
one
customer
say
well
what
if
you
left
out
something
we
hadn
t
left
out
a
thing
but
it
didn
t
matter
compaq
have
beaten
us
to
market
and
establish
reliability
and
as
always
their
high
price
signal
high
quality
we
would
have
to
come
back
to
this
fight
later
and
well
arm
in
we
also
make
a
fundamental
change
to
our
business
model
sell
our
pc
in
discount
retailer
and
superstores
there
be
argument
among
our
manager
for
and
against
the
move
those
oppose
argue
that
retailer
could
never
deliver
the
kind
of
service
and
support
consumer
have
come
to
expect
from
dell
what
s
more
the
doubter
say
dealer
markup
would
either
cut
into
our
profit
margin
or
force
us
to
raise
price
ourselves
those
in
favor
cite
the
big
rise
in
pc
sale
at
discount
retailer
and
superstores
like
priceclub
and
sam
s
club
and
the
possibility
of
reach
the
many
household
and
small
business
consumer
who
shop
at
these
store
people
like
to
buy
computer
they
could
look
at
and
touch
break
into
this
market
some
among
us
argue
could
quickly
build
our
brand
name
and
bring
in
million
in
annual
revenue
with
an
eye
on
those
number
we
sign
agreement
with
compusa
staple
and
priceclub
to
sell
our
pc
and
peripheral
and
for
the
next
two
year
it
look
as
though
the
doubter
have
be
wrong
our
revenue
just
kept
climb
by
fiscal
year
our
revenue
have
risen
to
million
our
ever
more
successful
sale
strategy
of

big
institutional
customer
fortune
company
like
exxon
and
dow
chemical
and

citibank
as
well
as
state
and
federal
government
along
with
educational
and
health
care
institution
have
a
lot
to
do
with
our
rapid
growth
in
we
enter
the
fortune
at
number
with
sale
of
million
a
very
proud
moment
for
me
personally
and
for
the
whole
team
we
d
be
in
business
for
just
seven
year
i
be
twenty
six
could
i
have
imagine
such
a
thing
as
a
kid
peruse
those
big
thick
copy
of
fortune
that
come
to
the
house
every
month
okay
i
ll
admit
that
i
could
have
i
always
do
dream
big
but
i
don
t
think
even
my
ambitious
young
self
could
ve
foreseen
the
threshold
where
we
stood
on
january
when
our
sale
for
fy
hit
million
and
the
fabled
billion
dollar
barrier
seem
reachable
even
breachable


my
ambitious
young
self
certainly
couldn
t
have
foreseen
my
reaction
when
our
first
child
kira
be
born
in
january
i
be
smitten
with
her
and
with
fatherhood
from
the
moment
she
arrive
i
remember
hold
her
in
her
room
a
day
or
so
after
she
get
home
from
the
hospital
and
think
wow
this
be
a
total
game
changer
but
i
don
t
think
i
understood
the
plight
of
people
with
kid
until
i
have
my
own
as
all
parent
learn
quickly
have
a
lot
of
new
stuff
to
worry
about
be
part
of
the
deal
i
certainly
learn
this
lesson
fast
when
we
brought
kira
home
from
the
hospital
and
she
start
turn
blue
your
first
thought
be
should
we
call
but
the
baby
be
breathing
fine
she
be
just
blue
so
we
call
my
mom
why
don
t
you
wrap
her
in
a
blanket
mom
say
we
wrap
kira
in
a
blanket
and
the
blue
go
away
turn
out
she
be
just
cold
who
knew
baby
turn
blue
when
they
re
cold
mom
do
now
we
do
too
that
be
easy
but
not
everything
be
the
spring
of
saw
our
ninth
anniversary
as
a
company
susan
and
i
have
be
married
for
just
two
and
a
half
of
those
nine
year
susan
be
a
businesswoman
so
she
understood
my
laser
focus
on
the
company
my
frequent
distraction
if
you
want
to
win
olympic
gold
you
have
to
be
fanatical
and
if
you
want
to
have
a
successful
relationship
you
have
to
have
love
trust
respect
and
commitment
my
wife
and
i
both
felt
all
those
thing
deeply
but
that
didn
t
make
the
inevitable
imbalance
between
my
work
life
and
my
home
life
any
easy
and
life
always
have
a
way
of
take
unexpected
turn
one
weekend
when
kira
be
sixteen
month
old
it
be
mid
may
of
susan
and
an
old
friend
both
celebrate
belated
bat
mitzvah
we
have
all
of
our
family
and
many
friend
in
town
apparently
someone
found
out
about
it
and
assume
we
might
not
be
home
that
even
we
left
the
baby
with
her
nanny
go
to
the
celebration
and
have
a
nice
time
after
a
while
susan
call
home
to
see
how
thing
be
go
but
instead
of
the
nanny
officer
so
and
so
from
the
austin
police
department
answer
the
phone
quite
understandably
susan
begin
to
freak
out
with
my
compartmentalize
ability
in
full
deployment
i
be
able
to
calm
her
down
enough
after
a
few
moment
to
take
the
phone
and
talk
to
the
police
officer
sir
there
s
be
a
break
in
at
your
house
he
say
my
heart
drop
down
an
elevator
shaft
for
a
second
be
anybody
injured
i
ask
no
sir
everybody
s
fine
the
officer
say
your
daughter
and
the
babysitter
be
fine
needle
to
say
we
get
home
fast
what
happen
behind
our
backyard
on
valburn
circle
be
a
steep
slope
with
a
foot
retain
wall
to
keep
the
house
from
slide
off
the
hill
it
turn
out
that
some
guy
have
an
accomplice
with
a
dirt
bike
drive
him
up
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
then
get
off
the
bike
scale
the
wall
and
broke
into
the
house
through
a
window
in
the
exercise
room
we
have
an
alarm
system
but
the
only
time
we
ever
turn
it
on
be
when
we
all
left
so
it
be
off
that
night
we
do
have
some
camera
but
this
guy
apparently
knew
where
the
camera
be
knew
the
layout
of
the
house
and
knew
exactly
where
he
want
to
go
to
get
whatever
he
want
to
get
mainly
jewelry
the
babysitter
heard
a
noise
and
with
kira
in
her
arm
go
to
our
bedroom
to
see
what
be
go
on
and
saw
a
guy
dress
in
black
and
wear
a
mask
somehow
the
guy
didn
t
see
her
and
somehow
she
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
take
kira
into
our
dress
room
closet
turn
off
the
light
and
hold
her
quietly
after
the
burglar
get
what
he
want
and
left
she
call
the
police
we
d
thought
the
peril
of
my
be
a
local
celebrity
in
austin
be
limited
to
the
goofy
drive
bys
the
car
that
tool
slowly
past
our
house
and
the
occasional
well
wisher
who
felt
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
come
up
the
walk
and
ring
the
doorbell
but
this
take
thing
to
a
whole
new
level
on
the
advice
of
mort
meyerson
i
call
ross
perot
who
be
say
to
know
a
thing
or
two
about
security
and
good
old
ross
snap
right
into
action
here
s
what
we
re
gonna
do
he
say
in
that
crisp
texas
accent
and
he
do
it
he
sent
over
the
head
of
his
security
team
and
we
put
a
whole
new
system
into
place
with
a
guard
in
a
gatehouse
and
hour
monitoring
it
be
a
scary
incident
but
it
be
also
a
very
inexpensive
wake
up
call
what
have
happen
could
have
be
much
much
bad
the
episode
be
an
end
to
some
kind
of
innocence
i
d
thought
like
most
people
that
we
could
just
live
our
life
and
everything
would
be
fine
but
that
turn
out
not
to
be
the
case
fame
be
overrate
for
sure
but
from
that
point
on
thing
change
fortunately
in
we
d
bought
a
piece
of
land
in
the
hill
west
of
austin
and
start
design
a
new
home
it
be
time
to
put
a
little
more
space
between
us
and
the
complicate
world
in
which
we
be
living


we
have
expand
across
europe
as
far
as
it
be
possible
to
go
russia
wasn
t
really
open
at
the
time
and
now
we
be
turn
our
focus
toward
asia
where
two
third
of
the
world
s
population
live
it
be
clear
that
our
corporate
logo
just
a
bunch
of
character
in
an
alphabet
not
use
by
much
of
the
world
need
update
in
early
our
new
logo
design
by
the
new

firm
of
siegel
gale
make
its
debut
on
our
annual
report
for
the
fiscal
year
that
end
on
january
the
new
logo
contain
a
seemingly
minor
change
that
would
grow
to
have
enormous
importance
to
us
by
tilt
the
e
of
dell
back
degree
the
designer
have
transform
a
run
of
the
mill
word
on
the
page
into
a
powerful
and
universally
recognizable
visual
symbol
one
that
fit
our
grow
identity
as
a
world
class
company
as
siegel
gale
put
it
the
new
graphic
identity

the
company

irrepressible
spirit
that
stood
the
pc
industry
on
its
ear
by
sell
directly
to
the
customer
or
as
i
like
to
put
it
the
e
be
point
upward
for
continual
growth
and
progress
we
sure
have
the
growth
part
down
on
january
dell
breach
the
fabled
billion
dollar
barrier
and
then
some
when
the
result
for
the
late
fiscal
year
be
announce
we
d
post
sale
of
not
one
billion
but
two
billion
dollar
billion
to
be
exact
it
s
say
that
company
hit
the
wall
when
they
get
to
a
billion
dollar
in
revenue
the
system
and
tool
require
to
run
a
billion
dollar
company
be
very
different
from
those
need
to
run
a
million
company
well
we
hadn
t
exactly
hit
the
billion
dollar
wall
we
d
jumped
right
over
it
and
thing
be
fall
apart
we
be
simply
grow
too
fast
the
different
part
of
the
company
each
believe
they
be
make
their
plan
but
when
you
roll
up
the
result
you
have
a
big
problem
in
reality
there
wasn
t
one
part
of
the
company
that
be
fully
capable
of
support
the
level
at
which
we
now
found
ourselves
we
be
outgrow
everything
our
ability
our
system
our
people
and
our
capital
structure
this
new
giga
size
dell
be
consume
much
more
capital
one
of
the
most
important
hire
i
make
in
that
period
be
tom
meredith
who
join
us
as
cfo
in
november
from
sun
microsystems
where
he
d
be
the
treasurer
i
give
tom
a
nickname
soon
after
he
arrive
the
alarmist
i
be
only
half
joking
tom
be
deeply
concerned
about
the
rate
at
which
we
be
burning
through
capital
our
mantra
he
say
be
growth
growth
growth
when
it
ought
to
be
liquidity
profitability
and
growth
in
that
order
change
be
go
to
be
hard
we
realize
we
would
have
to
intentionally
slow
down
our
expansion
and
build
more
capability
one
of
the
big
challenge
be
hire
and
nurture
the
talent
that
could
manage
what
be
clearly
go
to
be
a
multibillion
dollar
business
we
could
see
a
path
from
billion
or
billion
in
sale
to
billion
we
actually
have
a
plan
to
grow
from
billion
to
billion
over
the
next
couple
of
year
but
how
would
we
do
it
and
who
be
go
to
take
us
there
our
rapid
expansion
have
meant
lot
of
new
hire
in
every
department
engineering
sale
manufacturing
technical
support
finance
it
marketing
human
resource
everything
we
d
also
increase
the
size
of
our
board
of
director
from
five
to
seven
in
on
mort
meyerson
s
advice
we
add
tom
luce
a
prominent
texas
lawyer
who
d
work
closely
with
ross
perot
and
in
claudine
malone
a
black
woman
who
d
be
a
business
professor
at
harvard
and
georgetown
university
join
the
board
i
felt
that
diverse
perspective
would
help
our
grow
company
and
want
to
make
sure
we
have
as
many
different
outlook
as
possible
between
and
we
go
from
team
member
to
almost
and
we
be
add
dozen
of
new
people
by
the
week
but
though
we
have
talent
on
board
and
in
jay
bell
glenn
henry
david
lunsford
and
others
we
have
really
amaze
talent
in
those
early
day
with
everything
move
so
fast
we
hadn
t
yet
be
able
to
attract
a
solid
core
of
people
who
could
scale
the
business
to
ten
time
its
present
size
fifty
time
with
the
stability
and
predictability
it
need
i
be
just
begin
to
realize
that
the
people
who
get
us
from
point
a
to
point
b
might
not
be
the
same
people
who
could
get
us
from
point
b
to
point
c
we
d
just
barely
survive
our
early
financing
crisis
we
d
weather
the
fcc
certification
crisis
and
the
ibm
patent
crisis
and
the
memory
chip
inventory
crisis
but
now
we
be
run
into
personnel
crisis
and
they
weren
t
pretty
in
the
late
s
i
d
hire
a
guy
call
him
sam
to
head
up
all
our
sale
and
marketing
sam
have
a
stellar
r
sum
he
d
be
in
charge
of
ibm
s
sale
and
marketing
and
have
built
big
blue
s
reseller
program
with
great
success
he
then
go
to
help
tandy
radio
shack
rebrand
its
image
and
have
do
an
amaze
job
there
as
well
sam
come
to
dell
with
a
lot
of
impressive
new
idea
about
our
strategy
of
sell
to
big
corporation
i
put
a
bunch
of
young
executive
under
him
and
he
hire
a
bunch
more
and
sam
do
some
very
good
thing
for
us
and
then
there
be
other
thing
one
day
i
be
walk
down
the
hall
and
behind
a
close
conference
room
door
this
be
before
we
have
open
office
i
heard
yell
and
scream
go
on
i
thought
hmm
that
s
kind
of
odd
we
don
t
usually
yell
and
scream
around
here
so
i
walk
into
the
conference
room
and
saw
sam
his
face
bright
red
really
tear
into
a
couple
of
the
young
guy
on
his
staff
the
second
he
saw
me
he
kind
of
go
from
sixty
down
to
zero
in
a
second
so
what
s
go
on
in
here
i
ask
well
we
re
have
a
bit
of
a
discussion
michael
sam
say
okay
i
say
could
you
guy
maybe
keep
it
down
a
little
bit
it
turn
out
that
sam
have
a
serious
drinking
problem
there
be
a
hotel
next
to
our
office
and
the
hotel
have
a
bar
and
every
night
he
would
go
over
there
and
get
smash
then
get
in
his
car
and
weave
his
way
home
pretty
bad
for
all
i
knew
he
be
get
load
at
lunch
too
some
of
the
other
executive
and
i
do
an
intervention
with
sam
and
get
him
to
go
to
a
treatment
program
but
he
didn
t
last
long
there
and
he
didn
t
stay
with
us
long
either
around
the
same
time
we
hire
a
senior
vp
of
human
resource
call
him
ted
ted
come
to
us
from
motorola
where
he
d
be
very
successful
and
i
thought
he
be
a
great
guy
one
day
after
he
d
be
with
us
for
a
couple
of
year
another
one
of
my
vice
president
come
into
my
office
and
say
michael

re
go
to
have
to
sit
down
for
this
one
okay
i
say
and
sat
down
what
s
up
we
have
a
problem
with
ted

s
the
problem

hire
somebody
on
the
second
shift
in
it
okay
he
s
in
charge
of
human
resource
that
s
his
job
what
s
the
problem
well
we
don
t
have
a
second
shift
in
it
the
vp
say
that
sound
a
little
unusual
i
say
have
you
ask
him
about
it
what
do
he
say
it
s
actually
a
little
more
complicate
than
that
he
say
she
s
a
stripper
it
turn
out
that
ted
who
be
married
and
have
kid
have
give
a
no
show
job
to
his
girlfriend
the
stripper
and
the
girlfriend
decide
she
want
more
money
so
she
come
to
the
company
and
say
she
d
need
a
good
chunk
of
change
to
go
away
needle
to
say
it
be
ted
who
go
away
what
he
d
do
didn
t
just
reflect
very
poor
judgment
on
his
part
of
course
steal
from
the
company
meant
he
be
immediately
go
no
far
discussion
need
we
be
grow
so
fast
the
number
of
people
in
the
company
be
increase
almost
as
fast
as
our
revenue
and
growth
cover
up
a
lot
of
sin
it
s
sort
of
impossible
to
insulate
yourself
from
the
possibility
of
some
inappropriate
thing
happen
but
this
be
another
one
of
those
innocence
lose
moment
i
found
it
to
be
such
reprehensible
behavior
i
didn
t
understand
why
someone
would
risk
destroy
his
most
important
life
relationship
i
be
probably
naive
but
i
be
also
focus
on
grow
the
company
i
would
ve
never
imagine
that
anything
like
this
would
occur
i
knew
that
it
be
my
job
to
set
the
tone
that
the
tone
at
the
top
really
matter
a
lot
from
that
time
forward
we
institute
a
policy
that
go
something
like
this
if
you
re
a
vp
or
above
don
t
do
anything
that
would
reflect
negatively
on
the
company
if
you
re
a
vp
or
above
and
you
re
think
about
go
to
a
place
where
woman
aren
t
wear
all
their
clothes
just
don
t
do
it
ted
have
fail
the
dell
iq
test
he
be
too
stupid
to
work
here


with
new
product
there
be
often
many
prototype
and
iteration
before
a
winner
emerges
we
test
these
product
by
preview
them
with
a
small
group
of
customer
start
small
help
improve
our
batting
average
then
once
we
actually
introduce
a
product
we
quickly
learn
from
customer
feedback
at
scale
how
well
it
s
go
to
do
we
take
those
lesson
and
keep
improve
each
new
product
take
lesson
from
the
prior
generation
in
all
area
design
and
feature
manufacturability
serviceability
etc
and
the
same
process
occurs
in
the
company
at
large
in
sale
service
and
support
supply
chain
etc
the
japanese
call
it
kaizen
or
continuous
improvement
but
for
every
company
dell
include
kaizen
be
an
ideal
rather
than
a
reality
success
be
not
a
straight
line
up
it
s
fail
learn
try
again
then
you
hope
succeed
how
successful
you
be
be
really
a
function
of
how
well
you
deal
with
failure
and
how
much
you
learn
from
it
many
people
don
t
reach
their
great
potential
because
they
fear
failure
in
avoid
failure
they
deprive
themselves
of
a
great
teacher
many
others
fall
short
because
of
lack
of
opportunity
capital
knowledge
or
skill
persistence
be
an
all
important
quality
on
the
road
to
success
and
success
present
its
own
challenge
avoid
complacency
be
the
first
and
big
which
be
why
along
with
kaizen
pbns
pleased
but
never
satisfied
have
be
part
of
our
culture
since
the
begin
i
ve
always
kept
memento
in
my
office
some
of
them
personal
family
thing
and
such
and
some
that
remind
me
of
the
company
s
high
point
and
low
point
along
the
way
the
low
point
matter
a
lot
though
it
s
nice
to
remember
success
it
s
important
to
remember
failure
too
we
ve
have
some
product
that
fail
so
badly
we
never
even
introduce
them
one
memento
that
i
kept
for
a
long
time
be
a
prototype
for
a
mobile
computer
from
the
early
s
it
s
hard
to
imagine
today
but
thirty
year
ago
the
truly
portable
computer
be
an
elusive
ideal
the
first
portable
back
in
the
early
s
be
massive
thing
know
as
luggables
they
didn
t
have
battery
you
have
to
plug
them
in
they
be
essentially
portable
desktop
the
technology
advanced
but
for
tech
company
across
the
board
dell
very
much
include
the
first
several
year
of
make
notebook
computer
be
not
pretty
there
s
a
video
from
in
which
glenn
henry
and
i
proudly
tease
our
new
n
and
n
notebook
there
i
be
with
my
baby
face
and
big
glass
solemnly
tick
off
the
machine
great
specification
world
class

standard

and
a
weight
of
pound
at
eight
and
a
half
by
eleven
inch
and
two
inch
thick
those
thing
be
hefty
little
slab
of
early
s
technology
a
comparison
with
our
xps
by
inch
and
a
mere
inch
thick
weigh
in
at
just
pound
and
with
so
much
more
compute
power
that
it
s
hard
to
know
where
to
begin
to
describe
it
doesn
t
really
seem
fair
as
senior
vice
president
of
our
product
group
glenn
built
our
engineering
staff
from
seven
to
several
hundred
people
oversaw
a
product
portfolio
that
grow
from
three
to
over
forty
product
and
with
a
brilliant
engineer
name
terry
park
establish
a
big
and
bustling
patent
program
terry
be
brilliant
but
extremely
quiet
if
he
ever
say
a
word
i
never
heard
it
glenn
be
a
great
engineer
himself
but
i
think
it
s
fair
to
say
that
manage
people
wasn
t
his
passion
he
d
just
sit
in
the
conference
room
with
a
pile
of
spec
sheet
drinking
this
wretched
stuff
call
tab
and
eat
rice
cake
while
his
engineer
stream
in

i
be
proud
of

in
the
early
s
it
be
painfully
clear
that
our
notebook

technological
achilles
heel
for
a
major
campaign
to
revamp
this
key

a
couple
of
month
after
john
come
to

we
add
another
key
player
from
apple
eric
harslem
a
vice
president
of
apple
s
macintosh
division
become
the
senior
vp
of
our
product
group
succeed
glenn
who
take
the
new
post
of
chief
technology
officer
eric
s
assignment
be
to
oversee
development
and
marketing
for
our
entire
product
line
he
and
john
and
especially
john
shook
thing
up
as
soon
as
they
arrive
and
in
they
really
need
shake
up
in
the
first
quarter
of
fiscal
year
from
february
till
early
may
our
grow
pain
become
painfully
apparent
with
our
earnings
down
by
percent
our
first
quarterly
loss
since
we
d
go
public
and
cash
scarce
we
d
have
to
withdraw
a
secondary
stock
offering
due
to
wall
street
s
lack
of
interest
between
january
and
june
our
stock
fell
from
a
historic
high
of
in
january
to
in
july
we
warn
investor
that
thing
might
not
turn
around
again
for
two
more
quarter
we
be
go
to
have
to
make
some
big
time
change
and
a
lot
of
those
change
be
go
to
hurt
our
notebook
business
be
an
especially
sore
point
because
our
thrive
pc
business
be
take
up
so
much
of
our
bandwidth
we
d
simply
fail
to
keep
our
eye
on
the
ball
where
notebook
be
concerned
the
other
major
pc
manufacturer
be
now
get
percent
of
their
revenue
from
notebook
for
compaq
the
figure
be
percent
for
us
it
be
percent
our
challenge
in
notebook
also
meant
that
we
be
late
to
market
with
a
portable
with
the
new
intel
processor
john
medica
s
mandate
be
to
make
us
a
player
in
notebook
and
he
hit
the
ground
run
as
soon
as
he
arrive
he
take
a
careful
look
at
our
current
product
lineup
and
the
new
model
on
our
draw
board
and
found
both
sorely
lack
the
machine
we
d
be
sell
the
sli
and
the
sli
be
not
only
underpowered
but
have
a
design
flaw
a
capacitor
that
might
crack
under
physical
stress
and
overheat
possibly
pose
a
fire
hazard
and
john
conclude
that
the
new
computer
by
the
time
we
could
get
them
to
market
would
be
old
news
technologically
that
october
he
institute
a
recall
of
seventeen
thousand
notebook
put
an
embargo
on
sell
any
more
sli
s
and
sli
s
and
kill
the
new
lineup
completely
the
financial
cost
to
us
between
repair
the
old
machine
and
spike
the
new
one
be
over
million
the
effect
on
our
morale
be
even
more
painful
for
month
to
come
while
john
oversaw
the
development
of
a
new
line
of
notebook
computer
we
would
simply
be
sit
on
the
sideline
of
the
fast
grow
segment
of
the
pc
market
the
cost
of
our
notebook
hiatus
along
with
the
cost
of
improve
our
internal
process
be
go
to
add
up
to
a
charge
of
between
million
and
million
maybe
more
in
it
seem
every
piece
of
news
i
heard
get
bad
and
bad
and
bad
and
i
didn
t
tell
anyone
except
susan
but
for
a
long
time
that
year
i
be
in
a
state
of
slowly
rise
panic


then
a
new
year
dawn
the
year
of
dell
inc
s
tenth
anniversary
and
with
it
come
more
help
and
hope
we
d
hire
the
consult
firm
bain
co
to
help
us
navigate
this
crisis
and
one
of
their
partner
kevin
rollins
especially
impressed
me
kevin
be
a
strategy
guy
more
than
a
product
guy
his
experience
be
mainly
with
aerospace
company
and
from
the
begin
he
understood
our
business
more
deeply
than
anyone
i
d
ever
work
with
before
and
there
be
one
piece
of
our
strategy
that
he
immediately
home
in
on
our
now
three
year
old
decision
to
sell
our
pc
through
big
box
chain
store
like
sam
s
club
and
walmart
kevin
felt
strongly
right
away
that
the
dollar
these
retail
sale
add
to
our
revenue
weren
t
worth
the
trouble
he
argue
that
with
the
resellers
effectively
act
as
a
barrier
between
us
and
the
people
who
bought
our
computer
in
store
a
vital
line
of
communication
between
dell
and
these
consumer
be
lose
we
could
learn
nothing
from
those
buyer
about
what
they
thought
of
our
product
performance
direct
be
our
brand
this
kind
of
indirectness
threaten
to
undermine
everything
we
d
built
and
so
we
stop
just
like
that
some
business
journalist
and
financial
analyst
say
loudly
that
the
switchback
make
us
look
indecisive
but
people
be
always
go
to
say
thing
and
there
be
bad
thing
for
a
company
than
temporarily
look
bad
we
be
in
serious
need
of
regroup
and
it
be
important
to
ignore
the
yap
dog
and
stick
to
the
plan
which
be
we
be
the
fifth
large
computer
company
in
the
world
we
d
make
it
past
the
billion
barrier
we
be
closing
in
on
billion
and
we
intend
to
go
to
billion
i
be
all
for
meeting
that
ambitious
goal
but
part
of
me
be
also
think
okay
now
we
re
go
to
go
to
billion
seriously
this
be
get
to
be
a
big
damn
company
there
s
a
lot
of
stuff
we
don
t
know
how
to
do
here

thought
we
need
some
more
help
so
i
contact
heidrick
struggle
the
recruiting
firm
go
find
me
somebody
who
can
partner
with
me
in

business
from

to

told
them
somebody
who
have
broad
international
experience
and
expertise
in
supply

a
pretty
quick
gut
reaction

some
of
them
far
few
make
me
say
yes

cell
phone

up
motorola
s
mobile
product
have
multiple
us
in
industry
law
enforcement
and
the
military
among
other
area
and
land
mobile
product
be
the
company
s
crown
jewel
a
billion
international
division
at
a
time
when
motorola
be
one
of
the
most
esteem
company
in
the
world
mort
ran
manufacturing
and
sale
and
marketing
he
pretty
much
have
the
whole
package
and
i
like
him
immediately
he
be
brooklyn
born
and
there
be
a
lot
of
brooklyn
still
in
him
and
i
don
t
just
mean
his
accent
he
be
warm
and
tough
at
the
same
time
and
supersmart
he
have
broad
experience
in
technology
and
i
also
like
the
fact
that
he
wasn
t
itch
to
leave
motorola
he
be
happy
there
and
justifiably
proud
of
his
achievement
he
and
his
wife
have
recently
built
a
retirement
house
in
la
vega
and
be
planning
to
move
there
for
good
after
mort
have
work
a
few
more
year
he
also
checked
another
box
for
me
we
need
to
bring
in
someone
at
a
very
high
level
someone
who
in
essence
could
work
side
by
side
with
me
to
lead
the
company
to
the
next
big
milestone
if
that
person
be
forty
five
or
fifty
year
old
all
the
people
below
him
would
inevitably
think
i
ve
lose
my
chance
but
mort
i
thought
but
didn
t
say
yet
could
be
a
kind
of
wise
hand
or
elder
statesman
someone
who
wouldn
t
really
intimidate
anybody
someone
who
be
just
here
to
help
mort
and
i
first
met
in
january
and
we
get
together
several
time
afterward
just
to
keep
talk
about
how
run
a
billion
global
business
would
work
he
wasn
t
audition
he
be
just
advise
me
and
everything
he
say
make
a
lot
of
sense
yet
after
we
met
a
few
time
i
kind
of
saw
something
click
in
him
i
could
tell
he
be
get
interested
in
the
challenge
of
help
us
rise
to
the
next
level
so
i
make
him
an
offer
and
come
up
with
a
title
i
thought
everyone
especially
mort
could
live
with
vice
chairman
soon
after
he
join
us
we
form
what
we
call
the
office
of
the
chairman
the
ooc
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
he
and
i
be
work
together
mort
immediately
go
into
operating
mode
help
where
we
need
help
we
need
help
one
of
our
big
need
be
something
he
knew
a
lot
about
we
be
go
through
a
rapid
expansion
internationally
particularly
in
asia
we
be
set
up
a
factory
in
penang
malaysia
and
lay
the
groundwork
for
go
into
china
and
get
go
in
japan
and
we
be
expand
production
dramatically
in
ireland
and
in
texas
we
weren
t
only
building
the
business
we
need
much
strong
operational
discipline
and
mort
brought
that
which
help
quite
a
bit
he
also
confirm
my
sense
that
kevin
rollins
with
his
brilliant
strategic
understand
of
our
company
have
become
a
de
facto
and
crucial
part
of
our
senior
management
team
even
though
he
be
still
officially
employ
by
bain
it
be
an
odd
arrangement
on
weekday
kevin
be
work
with
us
in
texas
on
weekend
he
flew
back
to
boston
to
be
with
his
family
bain
write
his
paycheck
but
once
a
week
kevin
and
mort
and
i
would
have
a
dinner
meeting
together
and
kevin
would
set
the
agenda
and
have
a
say
in
all
our
decision
on
personnel
new
investment
area
new
product
we
roll
out
an
important
new
product
that
year
the
notebook
computer
that
john
medica
and
his
team
developed
we
call
it
the
latitude
as
i
d
expect
john
and
his
crew
have
come
up
with
a
beautiful
machine
solid
well
design
and
with
great
attention
to
detail
memory
storage
card
be
easy
to
remove
the
floppy
disk
drive
could
be
take
out
and
replace
with
a
second
battery
for
longer
run
time
battery
life
be
a
big
sell
point
with
the
latitude
a
breakthrough
really
both
the
base
model
and
the
high
end
xp
version
could
run
for
eight
hour
without
recharge
the
xp
use
a
lightweight
lithium
ion
battery
a
new
technology
at
the
time
and
as
always
our
price
be
supercompetitive
for
the
base
model
for
the
xp
as
compare
to
for
a
base
model
compaq
contura
notebook
and
for
the
tricked
out
contura
cx
it
have
be
painful
to
sit
on
the
sideline
and
watch
as
the
notebook
market
boom
and
it
wouldn
t
be
easy
to
win
our
way
back
in
but
we
felt
quietly
confident
that
we
could
we
thought
we
have
a
winner
on
our
hand
and
time
would
prove
us
right


there
be
another
product
opportunity
we
have
to
attend
to
in
november
of
we
have
a
board
meeting
in
paris
and
kevin
still
a
bain
consultant
and
i
give
a
presentation
about
why
we
need
to
go
into
the
server
business
in
a
big
way
and
why
if
we
didn
t
it
could
be
real
trouble
at
the
begin
of
the
meeting
the
board
s
attitude
be
why
the
heck
be
you
do
this
at
the
end
it
be
like
well
why
haven
t
you
already
do
it
we
d
be
think
for
a
long
time
about
reentering
the
server
market
in
order
to
target
enterprise
customer
and
in
the
early
s
certain
event
coalesce
that
decide
the
question
for
us
software
developer
like
novell
and
com
and
banyan
along
with
microsoft
which
have
recently
introduce
window
nt
be
make
server
operating
system
that
allow
company
to
create
client
server
base
network
system
which
be
begin
to
spring
up
all
over
the
place
in
large
and
small
corporation
and
compaq
our
archrival
down
in
houston
have
an
early
lead
with
its
systempro
intel
base
server
one
of
the
most
strike
thing
about
the
server
market
be
how
profitable
it
be
these
be
complicate
machine
and
the
margin
on
them
be
much
high
than
those
on
pc
compaq
be
offset
the
small
profit
it
make
from
sell
its
pc
at
a
high
price
point
and
through
retailer
with
the
rich
profit
its
server
business
brought
in
but
even
if
our
machine
be
less
expensive
and
ultra
dependable
and
our
service
organization
be
the
best
around
get
company
to
switch
from
compaq
s
server
to
ours
be
go
to
be
a
tall
order
if
i
be
a
system
administrator
who
d
already
learn
how
to
use
the
systempro
and
somebody
come
along
and
say
we
want
to
buy
this
other
server
i
d
be
likely
to
say
no
i
m
already
use
to
this
one
with
pc
it
be
relatively
simple
to
switch
from
one
brand
to
the
other
with
server
it
wasn
t
on
the
other
hand
we
calculate
that
if
compaq
be
left
alone
in
the
server
sector
they
would
have
so
much
profit
that
they
could
use
it
to
attack
the
pc
market
and
put
us
out
of
business
that
get
our
attention
there
be
three
small
server
company
that
we
look
at
acquire
sequent
tricord
and
netframe
but
in
the
end
we
conclude
that
it
would
be
easy
to
create
a
dedicate
team
of
engineer
and
just
make
our
own
machine
in
early
we
introduce
the
poweredge
line
with
at
the
start
two
model
the
sp
for
small
to
medium
size
network
environment
and
the
xe
for
midsized
to
large
network
that
same
year
we
brought
in
larry
evans
from
sequent
to
be
vice
president
of
server
engineering
and
a
couple
year
later
we
hire
mike
lambert
compaq
s
vice
president
of
marketing
for
server
to
run
our
server
business
pretty
soon
we
be
give
compaq
a
run
for
their
money


in
addition
to
see
the
possibility
of
server
we
decide
around
that
time
to
attack
on
another
front
what
be
then
know
as
the
professional
workstation
part
of
the
industry
in
contrast
to
pc
workstation
be
specialized
machine
with
superpowerful
graphic
and
display
use
for
computer
aid
design
and
simulation
by
chip
designer
architect
and
others
require
advanced
capability
sun
microsystems
itself
later
acquire
by
oracle
and
hp
which
have
acquire
apollo
computer
an
early
leader
in
workstation
be
then
dominate
this
field
both
company
be
vertically
integrate
they
produce
several
of
the
component
other
corporation
outsource
even
design
their
own
microprocessor
and
both
make
significant
profit
on
these
product
which
also
help
fuel
their
effort
in
server
and
storage
we
felt
strongly
that
give
the
rapid
advance
in
microprocessor
from
company
like
intel
and
improvement
in
window
we
could
create
a
workstation
powerful
enough
to
run
these
specialized
application
and
offer
far
great
value
to
customer
in
the
process
if
we
succeed
we
could
low
price
to
a
level
where
we
would
earn
a
profit
but
sun
and
hp
could
not
the
total
amount
of
profit
in
the
workstation
space
would
likely
shrink
but
if
we
be
successful
we
would
end
up
with
a
significant
part
of
it
this
be
jeff
clarke
s
first
big
opportunity
he
have
show
tremendous
talent
as
an
engineer
since
join
dell
in
and
be
now
ready
to
lead
this
important
new
part
of
the
company
in
we
would
introduce
our
first
workstation
the
initiative
be
not
without
its
challenge
but
jeff
succeed
magnificently
eventually
lead
us
to
a
number
one
share
position
a
few
year
later
sun
would
exit
the
workstation
business
altogether
and
hp
would
evolve
to
a
strategy
that
try
to
emulate
ours


in
there
be
just
over
website
in
the
world
up
from
a
mere
the
year
before
and
only
the
year
before
that
there
be
still
no
google
no
wikipedia
no
youtube
or
twitter
but
start
that
year
there
be
a
www

ever
since
my
teenage
experiment
with
a
hayes
modem
and
the
computerize
bulletin
board
system
i
d
be
fascinate
with
the
limitless
possibility
and
the
network
effect
of
online
communication
as
the
world
wide
web
get
up
and
run
it
seem
to
me
and
to
many
other
people
that
its
potential
be
infinite
in
the
web
s
early
day
the
excitement
be
all
about
information
an
ever
increase
amount
of
data
be
come
online
week
by
week
in
the
early
to
mid
s
back
at
the
start
our
website
be
also
about
information
early
adopter
and
tech
savvy
user
those
be
pretty
much
the
only
kind
of
user
then
could
visit
and
get
technical
data
about
our
product
and
an
email
address
for
tech
support
in
as
the
number
of
worldwide

jumped
up
to

and
the
internet
grow
more
sophisticated
by
the
hour
our
site
get
more
sophisticated
too
user
could
get

configure

cost
online
nineteen
ninety
five
the
year
a
little
thing
call
amazon
get
start
be
also
when
i
begin
to
get
seriously
interested
in
take
our
direct
sale
model
to
the
internet
the
evolution
of
e
commerce
lag
behind
that
of
online
data
retrieval
for
only
one
reason
the
mean
for
secure
online
purchasing
be
just
be
developed
and
consumer
unaccustomed
to
buying
this
way
strange
as
that
seem
now
be
leery
about
put
their
credit
card
number
out
there
in
the
ether
where
god
know
what
might
happen
to
them
but
as
method
evolve
for
secure
website
browser
and
server
e
commerce
begin
to
catch
on
we
want
to
be
as
far
ahead
of
the
curve
as
possible
the
way
i
saw
it
online
purchasing
and
our
direct
sale
model
be
a
perfect
marriage
in
the
early
s
i
present
this
approach
to
our
board
of
director
say
that
sell
online
would
allow
customer
around
the
world
to
access
information
about
our
product
more
quickly
and
efficiently
and
less
expensively
than
they
be
currently
able
to
do
by
phone
or
fax
online
a
potential
buyer
could
configure
his
or
her
ideal
machine
access
technical
information
about
it
make
the
purchase
and
then
follow
its
progress
as
it
be
built
and
ship
e
commerce
would
also
create
economy
of
scale
on
our
end
make
our
sale
team
and
the
whole
sale
process
vastly
quicker
and
more
efficient
our
website
begin
sell
pc
and
notebook
in
june
that
december
we
also
start
online
sale
for
our
poweredge
server
at
the
end
of
that
year
we
hit
another
landmark
our
online
sale
volume
reach
million
a
day
late
be
also
when
mort
and
i
finally
convince
kevin
rollins
to
formalize
his
de
facto
arrangement
and
join
us
as
a
senior
vice
president
a
couple
of
week
after
kevin
officially
begin
work
for
dell

put
him
in

of
our

business
unit
that
account
for
roughly
percent
of
our

have
run
a
piece
on
us

run
his
company
like
the
big
business
it
have
become
that
be
certainly
one
way
of
look
at
it
the
way
i
saw
it
i
d
sought
the
counsel
of

of
old
more
experienced
executive
lee
walker

each
have
be
very
helpful
in
his

a
learn
attitude
in
which
we
constantly
anticipate
and
understand
change
in
the
competitive
environment
and
create
strategy
that
will
capitalize
on
new
opportunity
we
will
apply
what
we
have
learn
and
always
challenge
the
assumption
that
the
business
operates
under
a
manager
will
empower
others
and
remove
the
obstacle
that
prevent
others
from
be
fully
productive
the
company
will
be
the
best
at
everything
we
do
michael
dell
november
i
be
twenty
three
when
i
write
that
and
my
ragtag
little
start
up

just
one
of
several
hundred
computer
company
around
the
country
one
that
be
have
some
success
but
also
as
we
ve
see
come
pretty
close
to
go
out
of
business
at
several
juncture
today
i
m
in
my
mid
fifty
in
charge
of
a
global
organization
with
over
team
member
and
everything
i
write
over
thirty
year
ago
still
hold
true
we
ve
held
on
to
those
value
on
every
step
of
our
path
without
them
we
wouldn
t
have
become
the
company
we
be
today


as
dell
grow
in
the
s
and
s
i
get
to
know
both
bill
gate
and
steve
job
pretty
well
gate
as
a
collaborator
and
business
partner
whose
company
make
the
operating
system
our
computer
ran
on
and
job
as
a
fellow
founder
who
want
to
be
a
business
partner
and
ultimately
become
a
friend
during
his
exile
from
apple
from
to
steve
start
next
a
company
whose
computer
and
software
he
try
to
make
the
big
new
thing
for
high
education
and
large
corporation
but
unlike
our
pc
and
server
the
next
workstation
while
a
beautiful
object
be
too
expensive
to
gain
a
foothold
in
the
market
especially
at
college
and
university
so
in
job
transition
to
software
development
exclusively
as
we
developed
our
website
in
the
mid
s
one
of
the
tool
we
use
be
a
piece
of
software
call
webobjects
which
next
have
developed
steve
come
over
to
my
house
a
couple
of
time
that
year
and
try
to
convince
me
to
use
the
next
operating
system
on
our
pc
argue
that
it
be
well
than
microsoft
window
and
that
we
could
also
use
it
to
attack
the
unix
workstation
market
that
sun
microsystems
be
lead
while
there
be
some
merit
to
his
idea
there
be
almost
no
application
port
to
his
operating
system
and
even
few
customer
ask
for
or
interested
in
it
he
be
nothing
if
not
persistent
though
and
in
early
soon
after
he
return
to
apple
he
make
me
another
business
proposal
he
and
his
team
have
figure
out
how
to
port
the
mac
operating
system
to
the
intel
x
computer
architecture
that
we
be
use
on
our
machine
and
steve
come
to
me
and
say
hey
look
this
thing
be
run
on
a
dell
pc
his
idea
be
to
license
the
mac
o
to
us
so
that
we
could
offer
computer
with
either
window
or
the
mac
operating
system
i
be
intrigue
but
his
business
proposal
to
us
be
preposterously
bad
i
say
to
steve
okay
for
every
machine
we
sell
with
the
mac
o
we
ll
pay
you
a
licensing
fee
but
he
be
concerned
that
if
we
sell
our
machine
with
his
operating
system
it
would
eat
into
the
mac
computer
market
because
we
have
way
more
scale
sell
many
more
machine
than
apple
do
and
our
cost
structure
be
very
efficient
steve
s
counterproposal
be
okay
you
sell
ten
of
million
of
these
pc
every
year
pay
us
a
royalty
on
every
single
one
and
then
you
don
t
have
to
think
about
whether
you
re
go
to
install
window
or
mac
o
you
can
put
them
both
on
all
the
machine
and
let
the
customer
decide
which
to
use
the
problem
be
simply
this
the
royalty
he
be
talk
about
would
amount
to
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
and
the
math
just
didn
t
work
because
most
of
our
customer
especially
large
business
customer
didn
t
really
want
the
mac
operating
system
steve
s
proposal
would
have
be
interest
if
it
be
just
us
say
okay
we
ll
pay
you
every
time
we
use
the
mac
o
but
to
pay
him
for
every
time
we
didn
t
use
it
well
nice
try
steve
another
problem
with
his
proposal
be
that
he
would
not
guarantee
us
access
to
mac
o
in
future
year
even
on
the
same
bad
term
this
meant
we
would
create
many
more
user
but
would
have
no
way
to
ensure
we
could
support
them
go
forward
steve
and
i
would
remain
mutually
respectful
and
friendly
at
a
certain
distance
his
birthday
february
be
one
day
after
mine
and
for
many
year
we
would
often
find
ourselves
in
hawaii
at
the
same
time
steve
love
the
kona
village
hotel
on
the
big
island
which
i
happen
to
own
until
it
be
destroyed
by
a
tsunami
a
few
month
before
he
die
sometimes
we
d
take
long
walk
together
talk
about
work
and
life
but
for
whatever
reason
a
business
partnership
be
never
in
the
card
now
and
then
the
tech
medium
amuse
itself
by
try
to
position
us
as
big
rival
back
in
for
instance
steve
threw
out
some
comment
about
how
dell
make
un
innovative
beige
box
and
that
get
some
play
it
roll
right
off
my
back
first
of
all
we
be
do
pretty
well
with
those
beige
box
but
mainly
steve
s
quote
be
the
kind
of
mild
trash
talk
that
be
pretty
common
in
our
industry
and
provide
a
certain
amount
of
entertainment
value
scott
mcnealy
the
cofounder
of
sun
microsystems
be
famous
for
his
zinger
about
other
company
once
when
someone
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
compaq
s
portable
he
say
well
they
make
great
plastic
and
handle
i
unwittingly
provide
a
little
too
much
entertainment
value
though
at
the
gartner
symposium
and
itxpo
in
orlando
in
october
it
be
a
moment
when
we
be
in
the
midst
of
our
sky
s
the
limit
period
and
apple
be
on
life
support
job
have
recently
return
as
interim
ceo
after
the
board
fire
gil
amelio
and
though
a
string
of
brilliant
idea
initiate
by
steve
the
imac
the
ipod
the
iphone
and
the
ipad
would
turn
apple
into
a
great
company
over
the
year
to
come
at
that
moment
in
the
fall
of
it
be
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
and
have
to
take
on
a
loan
from
microsoft
in
order
to
stay
afloat
and
while
i
be
do
a
q
a
onstage
at
the
orlando
expo
in
front
of
a
couple
thousand
it
executive
the
moderator
ask
me
what
i
d
do
to
fix
apple
if
i
be
its
ceo
i
frankly
felt
irritated
by
the
question
it
seem
like
another
one
of
those
situation
where
someone
be
just
try
to
whip
up
a
little
controversy
for
entertainment
value
so
i
say
what
i
felt
well
i
m
not
the
ceo
of
apple
i
don
t
know
why
don
t
you
ask
somebody
else
but
that
wasn
t
good
enough
for
this
guy
he
ask
me
again
again
i
answer
honestly
well
i
m
not
really
in
the
business
of
give
advice
to
other
company
either
the
guy
thought
i
be
be
coy
or
he
just
couldn
t
help
himself
come
on
he
say
what
would
you
do
at
this
point
i
felt
a
little
frustrate
maybe
more
than
a
little
what
would
i
do
i
echoed
i
d
shut
the
company
down
and
give
the
money
back
to
the
shareholder
that
get
a
big
reaction
from
the
audience
a
lot
of
laugh
even
a
few
gasp
of
surprise
the
guy
have
gotten
what
he
d
be
look
for
entertainment
and
the
thing
blew
up
my
quote
get
quote
out
of
context
all
over
the
wire
service
and
tech
website
dell
say
apple
should
be
shut
down
it
amuse
a
lot
of
people
over
the
next
few
week
and
month
heck
that
quote
have
leg
people
still
talk
about
it
today
it
be
stupid
of
me
unprofessional
i
let
myself
be
provoke
and
be
turn
into
an
object
of
amusement
the
archenemy
of
apple
which
i
wasn
t
not
even
close
in
truth
apple
really
wasn
t
on
my
mind
much
be
barely
on
my
radar
i
have
plenty
on
my
hand
work
with
my
team
to
run
dell
and
deal
with
our
direct
competitor
compaq
ibm
hp
but
steve
in
a
vulnerable
position
only
the
interim
ceo
the
company
he
d
cofounded
wouldn
t
fully
take
him
back
clearly
felt
stung
he
sent
me
an
email
that
read
ceo
be
suppose
to
have
class
i
can
see
that
isn
t
an
opinion
you
hold
so
i
call
him
i
explain
the
context
in
which
i
d
say
what
i
d
say
and
what
have
be
on
my
mind
in
that
moment
and
he
be
fine
with
it
he
seem
understand
then
a
couple
of
week
later
when
he
brought
together
several
hundred
of
his
manager
to
rally
around
apple
s
new
online
store
and
build
to
order
system
for
manufacturing
and
distribution
sound
familiar
steve
stood
on
a
stage
and
have
some
fun
at
my
expense
he
have
a
big
picture
of
me
project
on
a
screen
in
back
of
him
with
my
out
of
context
quote
i
d
shut
it
down
and
give
the
money
back
to
the
shareholder
that
get
the
predictable
reaction
from
his
manager
lusty
boo
i
ve
have
a
little
time
to
cool
off
i
guess
steve
told
them
i
can
sort
of
understand
it
michael
might
be
a
little
upset
that
we
ve
take
something
they
pioneer
and
really
do
it
a
lot
well
we
re
basically
set
the
new
standard
for
online
e
commerce
with
this
store
i
can
understand
he
s
a
competitive
guy
but
nonetheless
now
a
big
picture
of
me
smile
appear
on
the
screen
behind
him
so
i
guess
what
we
want
to
tell
you
michael
steve
say
be
that
with
our
new
product
and
our
new
store
and
our
new
build
to
order
manufacturing
we
re
come
after
you
buddy
and
with
this
a
big
target
be
superimpose
over
my
smile
face
the
crowd
burst
into
applause
ok
it
s
hard
to
imagine
today
with
steve
go
and
an
extremely
successful
apple
peacefully
coexist
with
a
very
successful
dell
but
back
then
ten
year
before
the
iphone
apple
really
be
an
underdog
truly
fight
for
its
life
just
as
we
have
at
several
juncture
it
be
rare
to
see
any
mention
of
the
company
that
didn
t
begin
with
phrase
like
trouble
plague
or
close
to
bankruptcy
so
for
steve
at
that
moment
the
glove
be
off
he
need
an
archenemy
to
rally
the
troop
and
we
be
it
even
if
apple
and
dell
be
really
apple
and
orange
and
in
steve
s
shoe
i
probably
would
ve
do
much
the
same
thing
and
i
would
do
the
same
thing
sixteen
year
later
remember
carl
icahn
and
the
red
diagonal
when
the
company
you
start
be
fight
for
its
life
you
do
whatever
it
take
what
you
do
after
you
win
though
be
what
separate
great
company
from
good
one


we
kept
win
later
that
same
month
october
a
huge
increase
in
online
trading

by
a
financial

a
severe

by
the
fact
that

he
say
but
that
s
not
the

now
their

what

total
climbed
to
billion
in
to
billion
in
by
y
k
we
have
more
than
thirty
six
thousand
team
member
both
in
round
rock
and
in
our
location
in
europe
the
middle
east
africa
asia
japan
and
south
america
our
stock
consistently
one
of
the
best
performer
on
the
nasdaq
kept
soar
splitting
for
in
twice
and
we
be
grow
like
crazy
susan
and
i
do
a
lot
of
walk
and
talk
during
that
period
counting
our
blessing
and
reflect
on
how
we
might
share
them
have
these
four
wonderful
child
make
us
realize
how
fortunate
we
be
and
they
be
and
how
many
child
around
the
world
weren
t
as
lucky
my
parent
taught
my
brother
and
me
about
tzedakah
charity
and
tikkun
olam
heal
the
world
and
they
lead
by
example
and
so
i
have
come
to
believe
that
give
back
could
be
the
most
important
part
of
my
job
susan
and
i
thought
about
a
number
of
thing
we
could
do
with
our
grow
philanthropic
ability
but
ultimately
we
decide
to
focus
on
child
in
urban
poverty
this
be
the
basis
for
the
michael
and
susan
dell
foundation
msdf
which
we
start
in
december
one
of
our
first
initiative
take
shape
right
at
home
in
central
texas
inspire
by
a
recently
create
us
department
of
health
and
human
service
program
call
schip
the
state
child
s
health
insurance
program
its
name
be
later
change
to
chip
under
this
plan
the
federal
government
give
state
match
fund
to
cover
uninsured
child
in
family
that
didn
t
have
enough
income
to
pay
for
health
care
but
weren
t
poor
enough
to
qualify
for
medicaid
the
problem
be
that
it
be
complicate
to
get
enrol
you
need
to
fill
out
a
long
application
form
and
a
copay
be
require
so
msdf
establish
a
program
insure
a
kid
to
help
family
get
sign
up
with
schip
and
assist
them
with
the
copay
the
federal
program
raise
its
game
after
a
couple
of
year
make
insure
a
kid
redundant
but
the
foundation
continued
to
direct
its
effort
toward
improve
education
and
child
s
health
in
central
texas
and
would
soon
go
global
expand
its
reach
to
major
urban
area
in
the
us
south
africa
and
india


we
weren
t
the
only
company
benefiting
from
the
rise
tide
in
tech
as
the
twentieth
century
drew
to
a
close
people
couldn
t
seem
to
get
enough
of
all
thing
technology
and
internet
technology
stock
in
general
be
go
banana
sometimes
mort
and
kevin
and
i
would
talk
about
it
and
say
it
look
like
the
market
be
pay
us
in
advance
for
thing
we
haven
t
do
and
maybe
we
ll
do
those
thing
in
the
future
but
maybe
we
won
t
in
the
midst
of
this
frenzy
we
seem
to
be
do
just
a
bit
well
than
anyone
else
on
the
supply
side
our
advantage
include
rigorous
quality
control
lean
inventory
close
relationship
with
our
supplier
and
efficient
cash
flow
management
and
on
the
demand
side
we
continued
to
hearken
back
to
rule
of
our
value
code
keep
the
customer
satisfied
pay
close
attention
to
his
or
her
ever
change
need
but
with
rule
section
b
of
the
code
employee
will
participate
in
decision
that
affect
their
own
work
and
receive
the
reward
that
come
as
a
result
of
their
effort
something
have
go
screwy
like
almost
all
growth
company
we
have
an
ownership
culture
we
want
everybody
in
the
company
to
be
an
owner
in
the
company
that
meant
reward
good
performance
with
stock
option
so
with
our
stock
just
zoom
rise
percent
between
the
last
trading
day
of
and
the
end
of
many
of
our
team
member
be
get
rather
rich
and
funny
thing
would
happen
people
would
say
oh
this
be
my
stereo
system
what
they
meant
by
that
be
not
that
it
cost
it
cost
but
have
they
not
sell
their
share
they
would
have
have
because
the
stock
be
go
nowhere
but
up
but
a
lot
of
our
people
held
on
to
their
stock
and
get
wealthy
and
they
become
know
especially
in
austin
where
we
be
the
big
tech
employer
in
town
and
conspicuous
consumption
be
particularly
conspicuous
as
the
dellionaires
there
be
literally
thousand
of
them
ownership

take
on
a
whole
new
meaning
the
rise
tide
be
lift
all
boat
and
people
be
buying
boat
big
one
people
also
bought
big
house
and
fancy
car
and
that
seem
fine
i
be
pleased
at
how
many
of
our
people
be
be
reward
and
reward
themselves
for
their
very
hard
work
then
the
stock
market
bubble
burst
as
the
year
dawn
it
turn
out
that
all
the
y

like
everyone
else
we
d
take
extensive
precaution
have
basically
come
to
nothing
but
as
the
year
proceed
something
really
do
happen
to
the
entire
tech
sector
y
k
begin
with
the
america
online
time
warner

the
big

that
point
by

we

the
pain
on
january
our
stock
price
stood
at
on
the
last
trading
day
of
that
year
it
have
drop
to
our
earnings
fell
short
of
wall
street
and
internal
estimate
for
five
consecutive
quarter
and
in
we
have
to
do
our
first
round
of
layoff
ever
let
some
people
go
in
february
and
another
in
may
this
be
especially
painful
i
really
hate
layoff
they
re
always
our
fault
never
the
fault
of
the
people
laid
off
and
we
try
to
avoid
them
like
the
plague
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
you
can
do
to
circumvent
them
you
can
stop
hire
new
people
you
can
ask
people
to
volunteer
to
leave
the
company
and
give
them
an
incentive
to
do
so
you
can
ask
people
to
work
less
and
earn
less
you
can
stop
pay
bonus
there
be
all
kind
of
lever
and
knob
but
this
be
the
first
time
we
d
have
to
let
people
go
our
people
and
the
fact
that
it
be
happen
across
the
tech
industry
didn
t
really
make
it
any
easy
on
the
other
hand
misery
love
company
if
the
whole
industry
be
down
you
think
okay
be
we
go
to
be
able
to
defy
gravity
probably
not
you
always
go
back
to
what
can
we
control
how
be
we
do
compare
to
the
whole
industry
what
s
the
overall
demand
picture
and
how
can
we
manage
our
business
for
the
best
possible
medium
and
long
term
outcome
demand
go
way
up
and
then
demand
go
way
down
well
we
ll
just
have
to
deal
with
it


and
not
everything
that
happen
in
be
gloom
and
doom
since
abandon
retail
channel
in
the
mid
s
we
d
concentrate
our
pc
sale
effort
on
the
big
customer
fortune
company
government
agency
health
care
institution
college
and
university
our
brand
have
take
on
a
very
businesslike
feel
which
be
fine
when
you
be
sell
to
business
meanwhile
though
consumer
sale
have
become
the
fast
grow
part
of
the
personal
computer
market
and
few
company
sony
be
the
most
notable
exception
be
sell
to
both
business
and
consumer
and
though
our
pc
business
be
do
very
well
we
be
always
look
to
grow
so
when
our
ad
agency
lowe
worldwide
propose
mount
a
campaign
to
make
dell
more
approachable
and
friendly
to
consumer
particularly
young
consumer
the
time
seem
exactly
right
lowe
s
idea
be
to
run
a
series
of
tv
commercial
star
a
precocious
kid
who
could
rattle
off
our
pc
s
spec
and
give
the
brand
a
human
face
the
agency
even
come
up
with
a
name
for
the
kid
steven
and
a
personality
he
d
be
tech
savvy
and
charmingly
goofy
at
the
same
time
lowe
thought
they
d
probably
cast
somebody
twelve
to
fifteen
year
old
and
they
put
out
a
cast
call
a
zillion
child
actor
and
stage
mother
respond
but
the
kid
who
end
up
get
the
job
be
a
nineteen
year
old
from
chattanooga
name
ben
curtis
ben
be
a
handsome
young
guy
with
a
shock
of
blond
hair
and
an
animate
face
with
fly
eyebrow
he
seem
like
the
personification
of
charmingly
goofy
the
first
commercial
feature
ben
as
steven
stand
in
his
bedroom
and
talk
to
the
camera
as
his
dad
in
the
background
yipped
and
howl
like
a
wolf
while
play
a
video
game
on
steven
s
computer
mom
hey
ben
say
it
s
me
steven
look
we
ve
gotta
talk
about
dad
i
think
it
s
time
he
have
his
own
computer
and
right
now
you
can
get
him
a
complete
dell
system
with
an
intel
pentium
iii
processor
kinda
like
mine
for
a
low
the
tv
spot
be
a
big
success
from
the
start
but
they
really
take
off
after
some
ad
genius
suggest
emphasize
ben
curtis
s
surfer
dude
quality
sort
of
a
combination
of
jeff
spicoli
from
fast
time
at
ridgemont
high
and
bill
and
ted
from
bill
ted
s
excellent
adventure
and
invent
a
catchphrase
for
him
dude
you
re
get
a
dell
it
be
like
touch
a
match
to
gasoline
from
that
moment
on
those
ad
and
that
catchphrase
just
blew
up
ben
curtis
become
an
instant
celebrity
and
our
pc
sale
shot
skyward
while
personal
computer
sale
be
down
percent
across
the
industry
during
the
first
three
quarter
of
our
market
share
rise
percent
more
than
double
the
previous
year
all
be
go
great
for
a
while
but
as
often
happens
when
ad
campaign
base
on
a
character
take
on
a
life
of
their
own
it
begin
to
feel
to
us
as
though
the
ad
be
become
more
about
steven
and
less
about
the
product
so
we
start
a
new
campaign
we
and
ben
curtis
go
our
separate
way
and
the
dell
dude
fade
into
history
a
lot
of
people
still
remember
that
catchphrase
though


in
july
i
get
a
nice
surprise
when
chief
executive
magazine
name
me
its
ceo
of
the
year
the
honor
be
especially
gratify
not
just
because
at
thirty
six
i
be
by
far
the
young
person
ever
to
receive
it
and
not
only
because
i
have
some
pretty
distinguish
predecessor
bill
gate
get
the
award
in
andy
grove
in
but
also
because
the
only
people
who
vote
you
in
be
your
fellow
chief
executive
officer
it
really
felt
as
if
i
d
be
accepted
into
an
illustrious
fraternity
at
the
same
time
i
knew
that
the
leader
of
a
company
usually
get
more
credit
or
blame
than
he
or
she
deserves
it
s
just
something
that
go
with
leadership
you
can
go
from
hero
to
zero
very
quickly
success
be
definitely
a
team
sport
and
i
be
fortunate
to
be
lead
a
great
team
i
could
really
only
accept
the
award
on
their
behalf
as
please
to
me
as
the
personal
honor
be
its
reflection
on
how
our
company
be
view
we
be
gritty
and
we
be
innovative
we
be
well
position
to
navigate
tough
time
as
well
as
good
time
it
probably
would
have
be
easy
to
give
me
the
award
when
our
business
be
double
in
size
every
year
and
our
stock
go
up
hundred
of
percent
per
year
i
say
then
but
it
s
probably
even
more
meaningful
to
get
it
in
what
be
a
challenge
year
for
the
whole
industry
and
for
the
whole
economy


yet
the
truth
be
the
dot
com
bust
hit
us
less
hard
than
it
do
other
company
to
a
great
degree
our
lean
and
fast
business
model
and
our
relative
independence
from
traditional
sale
channel
insulate
us
from
the
trouble
that
befell
our
big
slow
move
competitor
compaq
hewlett
packard
sun
microsystems
and
ibm
our
revenue
fell
only
percent
in
fy
but
our
market
share
grow
still
the
end
of
the
boom
reveal
flaw
in
our
company
culture
that
all
that
crazy
growth
have
easily
hidden
sometimes
when
the
tide
go
out
you
see
stuff
lie
around
the
beach
that
you
hadn
t
notice
before
and
it
isn
t
always
pretty
in
the
wake
of
the
layoff
we
meaning
we
in
upper
management
realize
we
have
to
reengage
our
workforce
by
let
all
those
people
go
we
have
broken
a
bond
of
trust
send
our
team
member
a
tough
new
message
your
job
be
not
guaranteed
there
be
now
an
implicit
new
employment
contract
as
long
as
we
have
work
and
as
long
as
you
have
skill
that
match
what
we
need
and
as
long
as
you
perform
you
re
go
to
have
a
job
but
if
any
of
those
thing
don
t
compute
you
might
not
have
a
job
under
these
uncompromising
new
term
how
could
we
inspire
our
people
kevin
rollins
and
i
have
a
lot
of
thought
about
the
question
kevin
have
join
mort
topfer
and
me
in
the
office
of
the
chairman
soon
after
officially
signing
on
with
dell
but
in
mort
have
help
us
climb
to
the
peak
of
our
seven
year
growth
spurt
have
finally
decide
he
want
to
retire
now
kevin
and
i
be
lead
the
company
together
like
lee
walker
and
i
and
mort
and
i
kevin
and
i
have
complementary
skill
where
he
tend
to
think
strategically
my
mind
naturally
gravitate
toward
the
technological
we
truly
be
a
team
we
have
adjoin
office
separate
by
a
move
glass
partition
that
we
always
left
open
besides
brilliant
strategic
insight
kevin
have
brought
something
else
equally
important
to
our
leadership
he
be
a
deeply
religious
mormon
principled
and
hardworking
dedicate
and
earnest
he
d
be
upset
by
the
flaw
in
our
culture
that
the
dot
com
bust
have
reveal
and
in
the
spring
of
he
and
i
begin
talk
about
the
need
for
a
new
document
something
like
the
one
i
d
create
in
a
write
articulation
of
the
value
and
belief
we
thought
he
and
i
and
everyone
else
in
the
company
should
live
by
kevin
and
i
agree
that
there
already
be
a
set
of
value
deeply
embed
in
our
company
but
that
time
and
circumstance
have
bury
them
too
deep
they
need
to
be
brought
back
into
the
light
of
day
for
a
long
time
we
d
conduct
a
company
wide
survey
call
tell
dell
the
poll
be
voluntary
and
anonymous
and
we
ve
always
gotten
a
very
high
degree
of
participation
a
lot
of
what
we
learn
during
that
period
be
painful
one
thing
we
found
be
that
our
flat
organization
model
which
allow
manager
at
all
level
to
make
operational
decision
without
have
to
get
approval
from
high
ups
help
us
to
move
quickly
and
efficiently
as
a
company
but
also
lead
to
some
excess
we
have
way
too
many
manager
who
get
great
business
result
but
broke
too
much
glass
along
the
way
they
be
not
be
collaborative
with
their
colleague
our
skyrocket
growth
and
constant
emphasis
on
gain
market
share
have
lead
to
a
culture
in
which
make
the
number
often
overshadow
teamwork
and
customer
satisfaction
sale
leader
be
promote
and
reward
whether
or
not
they
consider
the
feeling
of
their
team
member
somehow
bad
of
all
though
be
find
that
some
percent
of
our
team
member
say
they
d
go
work
for
another
company
if
they
be
paid
the
same
we
d
just
go
through
this
exhilarate
boom
and
now
here
be
the
dark
side
we
d
apparently
attract
a
lot
of
people
who
sign
on
because
they
thought
they
would
get
rich
and
now
that
they
realize
they
might
not
get
rich
they
be
wonder
what
they
be
do
at
dell
i
realize
that
we
have
create
a
culture
of
stock
price
a
culture
of
financial
performance
and
a
culture
of
what
s
in
it
for
me
throughout
our
employee
base
kevin
later
say
there
have
to
be
something
more
in
this
institution
that
we
love
more
than
just
make
money
or
have
a
stock
price
that
go
up
the
pioneer
psychologist
abraham
maslow
talk
about
a
hierarchy
of
human
need
put
them
in
the
form
of
a
pyramid
the
base
of
the
pyramid
be
physiological
requirement
food
water
shelter
etc
just
above
that
be
safety
need
like
personal
security
employment
health
then
move
upward
come
love
and
belonging
esteem
and
at
the
top
self
actualization
it
s
similar
for
team
member
in
a
company
at
the
pyramid
s
base
they
need
income
so
they
can
provide
for
their
family
every
company
provide
that
but
on
a
high
level
you
want
your
people
to
be
engage
by
their
work
that
leaf
a
lot
of
corporation
out
and
at
the
top
of
the
pyramid
leave
a
lot
more
corporation
out
what
you
really
want
be
for
your
employee
to
understand
the
purpose
of
the
company
and
feel
inspire
by
it
to
feel
that
what
they
re
do
be
incredibly
important
to
all
your
customer
and
serf
a
great
purpose
enable
human
potential
to
be
able
to
think
wow
i
actually
do
something
that
s
really
significant
and
what
we
do
matter
in
the
world
and
i
ve
get
a
reason
to
get
out
of
bed
every
morning
as
oppose
to
feel
like
i
m
in
a
dilbert
cartoon
i
go
to
work
and
punch
in
and
make
money
and
then
i
go
home
and
then
the
next
day
do
it
again
it
s
satisfy
to
make
money
but
feel
you
re
part
of
something
great
and
meaningful
be
a
much
high
form
of
satisfaction
while
we
be
ponder
all
this
in
the
late
summer
of
the
proverbial
black
swan
arrive


i
have
be

we
didn
t

plane
we
have
one
technician
who
have
a

safety
in
record
time

a
great
sadness

out
i
go
over
to
our
factory
here
in
north
austin
and
call
an
impromptu
town
hall
meeting
to
talk
about
the
tragedy
that
be
still
unfold
as
i
spoke
i
could
see
the
agony
on
our
people
s
face
their
deep
sadness
reflect
what
i
be
feel
many
be
weep
i
completely
understand
how
sad
you
be
i
say
how
sad
we
all
be
and
we
should
be
but
let
s
not
forget
that
actually
we
all
have
an
incredible
role
to
play
in
help
the
country
get
back
on
its
foot
our
customer

up
and
run
we
have
to
help
the
defense
department
so
let
s
go
back
out
there
and
get
this
do
there
be
no
plane
fly
so
we
have
to
figure
out
how
we
be
go
to
transport
all
these
computer
from
our
factory
to
our
customer
and
we
figure
it
out

forty
eight
hour
we
have
truck
deliver
an
enormous
number
of
computer
to
the
washington
dc
and
new
york
area
america
get
up
and
run
but
the
somberness
of
that
period
last
for
a
long
time
for
many
people
and
certainly
for
us
as
a
company
it
be
a
period
of
reflection
we
felt
a
fresh
urgency
to
examine
and
deepen
dell
s
corporate
culture
we
hire
an
outside
firm
to
perform
a
cultural
audit
assess
our
strength
and
weakness
as
an
organization
part
of
the
audit
be
a
series
of
degree
review
of
upper
management
include
kevin
and
me
as
early
as
the
end
of
september
kevin
and
i
begin
meeting
with
vice
president
in
each
region
to
discus
value
and
get
feedback
both
kevin
and
i
stood
up
at
these
meeting
and
talk
about
our
own
s
i
knew
i
be
apt
to
be
impatient
with
people
who
weren
t
listen
well
or
demonstrate
incompetence
i
could
be
too
slow
to
praise
good
performance
i
ve
get
some
thing
to
work
on
i
say
more
than
once
i
m
not
do
yet
i
want
to
get
well
everyone
recognize
that
when
your
revenue
and
profit
and
stock
price
be
grow
it
s
easy
to
lose
sight
of
the
great
purpose
of
what
you
re
do
conversely
if
you
have
a
company
where
the
revenue
and
profit
and
stock
price
be
fall
that
s
not
go
to
be
a
great
company
no
matter
how
good
the
culture
be
how
could
we
achieve
an
inner
balance
as
a
company
one
that
would
hold
during
good
and
bad
time
how
could
we
engage
and
inspire
our
team
member
to
create
a
culture
that
wasn
t
just
base
on
revenue
and
profit
and
stock
price
while
we
raise
revenue
and
profit
and
stock
price
at
the
same
time
back
at
the
begin
when
the
company
be
just
me
i
have
this
set
of
value
that
i
knew
be
important
but
i
didn
t
have
to
communicate
them
with
anybody
but
as
more
and
more
people
come
on
board
thing
get
more
complicate
as
a
company
grows
it
becomes
compartmentalize
our
salesperson
understood
our
value
because
they
be
interfacing
with
the
customer
all
the
time
as
be
the
technical
support
people
but
our
manufacturing
and
supply
chain
team
member
be
a
little
farther
away
from
the
voice
of
the
customer
we
battle
this
by
go
out
of
our
way
to
have
customer
visit
our
manufacturing
site
what
we
learn
be
that
the
best
way
to
tell
the
story
of
our
company
be
through
their
story
what
be
our
customer
try
to
accomplish
what
be
their
challenge
especially
the
new
and
unsolved
challenge
understand
these
new
and
unsolved
challenge
be
at
the
core
of
what
we
must
continue
to
do
as
a
company
to
succeed
why
be
what
they
be
do
important
in
the
world
and
how
be
we
help
them
to
do
it
we
all
agree
that
create
loyal
customer
have
to
be
the
rock
solid
foundation
of
our
new
value
statement
so
we
get
to
work


touchy
feely
be
a
term
that
hard
nose
corporate
people
like
to
use
disparagingly
the
caricature
version
be
that
a
consultant
come
into
a
big
company
and
get
everyone
to
sit
around
a
campfire
and
sing
kumbaya
but
those
hard
nose
type
ask
can
those
warm
and
fuzzy
feeling
endure
over
time
and
what
s
happen
with
the
balance
sheet
while
all
that
be
go
on
the
brilliance
of
kevin
be
that
he
always
saw
the
totally
practical
importance
of
the
touchy
feely
stuff
a
company
without
soul
he
knew
be
a
company
that
could
fray
and
break
apart
in
any
number
of
way
and
a
company
without
a
very
smart
and
hard
nose
business
strategy
will
very
quickly
become
doa
so
even
as
the
ooc
and
the
rest
of
our
executive
leadership
team
and
our
vice
president
be
create
our
new
value
statement
kevin
and
i
be
create
a
strategy
that
could
take
us
out
of
the
dot
com
bust
and
into
the
next
few
year
we
begin
with
the
understand
that
the
last
half
century
have
see
boom
and
bust
cycle
in
macroeconomics
the
life
of
company
and
the
us
economy
we
knew
we
be
just
in
one
of
those
cycle
and
we
knew
we
be
go
to
come
out
of
it
the
real
question
be
how
can
dell
emerge
from
this
cycle
even
strong
than
it
be
before
our
idea
be
to
triple
the
size
of
the
company
some
might
have
say
what
the
whole
industry
have
just
hit
the
wall
gdp
have
slump
to
negative
there
be
macroeconomic
issue
all
over
the
globe
and
we
re
go
to
triple
the
size
of
the
company
and
some
people
in
our
organization
say
exactly
that
at
first
but
our
solution
be
actually
simple
it
be
to
take
pricing
down
and
gobble
up
a
bunch
of
share
during
this
period
so
that
when
spending
on
it
return
we
would
have
a
much
large
share
of
wallet
and
therefore
capture
much
more
market
share
go
forward
we
be
naturally
position
to
do
all
that
because
of
our
supply
chain
cost
advantage
and
grow
customer
relationship
and
the
plan
start
work
immediately
meanwhile
our
new
value
statement
be
come
together
in
november
and
december
a
document
begin
take
shape
in
our
regional
forum
in
january
we
distribute
it
to
regional
executive
for
their
review
and
later
that
month
during
our
global
executive
management
committee
meeting
in
austin
we
make
final
revision
to
this
declaration
of
value
we
call
it
the
soul
of
dell
it
be
design
for
in
house
use
but
we
knew
we
d
be
proud
for
the
world
to
see
any
part
of
it
the

be
base
on
five
key

we
believe
our
continued
success
lie
in
teamwork
and
the
opportunity

team
member
have
to
learn
develop
and
grow

a
passion

in
everything
we
do
the
new
platform
have
evolve
naturally
from
my
value
statement
when
we
be
just
get
start
as
a
player
in
national
and
worldwide
market
by
we
have
more
than

globally
but
we
still
want
to
reassert
our
basic
value
and
talk
about
new
one
some
subtle
but
major
change

take
place
over
those
fourteen

our

become
plural

be
a
world
away
from
just
plain

we
be
position
ourselves
for
the
twenty
first
century
transition
from
be
primarily
a
pc
company
to
now
include
server
and
to
enter
the
software

a
superior
customer
experience
have
be
true
of

our
path
but
the
section
on
the
dell

have
to
address
the
dellionaire
mentality
as
well
as
the
layoff
the
new
platform

with
our
promise

like
the
statement
the
new
guideline

ethical
behavior
inside

but
they
go
far
stress
what
have
sometimes
be
overlook
in
our
boom
year
foster
open
two

the
new

and
contribute
positively
in
every
community
that
we
call
home
personally
and
organizationally
and
where
my
original
statement
have
end
inspirationally
but
a
little
vaguely
the
company
will
be
the
best
at
everything
we
do
the
new
platform
s
last
section

we
serve
be
know
as
a
great

and
a

place
to
work

last
but
by
no
mean
least
provide
superior
shareholder
return
over
time
the
second
to
last
bullet
point
be
an
answer
to
anyone
who
ask
if
i
m
not
go
to
be
rich
why
would
i
want
to
stay
the
reply
to
those
would
be
dellionaires
be
now
because
this
be
the
kind
of
place
we
want
to
be
but
provide
superior
shareholder
return
would
as
we
ve
see
prove
a
little
more
complicate

project
emerald
why
didn
t
you
just
walk
away
it
be
a
question
more
than
one
person
ask
me
after
the
bruising
battle
of
why
not
simply
leave
behind
all
the
headache
and
heartache
and
brain
ache
of
try
to
buy
back
my
own
company
i
d
make
a
lot
of
money
over
the
last
twenty
eight
year
i
could
afford
to
walk
off
into
the
sunset
stroll
on
the
beach
in
hawaii
and
collect
seashell
or
start
another
company
build
a
new
legacy
a
reporter
ask
me
the
question
soon
after
we
go
private
and
i
give
her
a
simple
answer
one
that
come
straight
from
my
heart
i
didn
t
want
another
company
this
be
the
one
with
my
name
on
it
i
will
care
about
this
company
after
i
m
dead
i
say
i
love
this
stuff
it
s
fun
for
me
i
couldn
t
be
more
thrill
to
have
control
over
my
own
destiny
in
a
way
that
be
not
possible
as
a
public
company
the
only
investor
conversation
i
have
to
have
now
i
told
her
be
with
self
the
company
have
my
name
on
it
but
it
be
so
much
more
than
me
we
be
an
amaze
team
all
of
us
i
felt
strongly
that
go
private
would
give
us
a
chance
to
do
good
for
our
customer
along
with
do
well
for
dell
and
so
on
october

close
our
door
to
the
outside
world
roll
up
our
sleeve
and
get
to
work


here
s
a
story
that
ll
give
you
an
idea
what
it
be
like
here
during
those
first
day
one
morning
that
fall
jeff
clarke
come
to
me
and
the
rest
of
the
executive
leadership
team
with
a
strategic
pitch
about
building
dell
s
future
business
architecture
he
talk
about
what
capability
we
need
to
move
forward
thing
like
improve
online
experience
enhance
digital
fulfillment
and
enrich
self
service
support
it
be
a
pretty
comprehensive
plan
and
a
fairly
large
sum
of
money
would
be
need
to
implement
it
somewhere
in
the
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
this
be
my
answer
thanks
for
bring
that
to
our
attention
jeff
the
board
have
met
the
board
have
decide
the
board
s
decision
be
to
go
ahead
suddenly
the
shackle
really
be
broken
the
quarterly
shot
clock
have
be
turn
off
all
at
once
we
could
implement
important
corporate
decision
at
the
moment
they
could
be
most
effective
dell
be
faster
and
more
agile
than
it
have
ever
be
that
fall
we
have
a
companywide
meeting
to
announce
all
the
thing
we
be
go
to
do
invest
in
sale
and
r
d
add
sale
capacity
grow
share
not
back
away
from
fight
with
competitor
we
say
we
be
go
to
go
do
all
these
thing
and
then
we
start
do
them
immediately
people
be
a
little
skeptical
at
first
it
s
private
equity
how
s
that
go
to
work
some
ask
we
have
to
clarify
that
silver
lake
be
our
financial
partner
but
they
weren
t
look
over
our
shoulder
they
knew
we
have
a
very
capable
team
in
all
aspect
but
the
old
way
die
hard
we
d
have
an
elt
meeting
and
the
sale
guy
would
come
in
and
kind
of
hesitantly
say
okay
there
be
a
lot
of
possibility
in
small
business
there
s
tremendous
growth
in
the
sector
the
operating
margin
s
very
attractive
and
we
want
to
add
seven
hundred
more
salesperson
and
i
d
say
well
why
don
t
we
add
fifteen
hundred
there
be
some
puzzle
look
in
the
begin
every
time
we
d
meet
i
d
say
when
be
we
go
to
have
a
meeting
when
i
m
not
ask
you
to
go
faster
with
small
business
sell
to
small
and
medium
size
business
be
incredibly
important
to
us
they
re
the
backbone
of
any
economy
but
they
re
generally
underserved
and
highly
fragment
in
order
to
be
aggressive
we
have
to
hire
new
salesperson
and
retrain
the
people
we
already
have
it
be
all
about
reimagining
the
art
of
the
possible
sell
to
these
business
and
earn
a
position
to
become
their
trust
adviser
which
then
give
us
the
opportunity
to
sell
our
whole
portfolio
of
solution
hardware
and
software
system
storage
security
and
service
and
to
finance
the
entire
thing
with
dell
financial
service
before
it
would
have
be
well
if
we
make
that
many
new
hire
then
the
earnings
per
share
be
go
to
be
low
next
quarter
and
we
won
t
hit
the
estimate
now
it
be
like
no
no
stop
overthinking
just
go
make
the
investment
but
very
quickly
our
people
saw
that
we
be
do
exactly
what
we
say
we
be
go
to
do
and
this
become
unbelievably
energize
there
be
high
excitement
throughout
the
company
and
the
evidence
for
this
wasn
t
just
anecdotal
we
be
use
np
net
promoter
score
a
tool
bain
have
developed
in
to
measure
the
relationship
between
a
provider
company
or
employer
in
this
case
dell
and
a
consumer
customer
or
employee
in
this
case
dell
team
member
in
the
week
and
month
after
we
go
private
our
employee
np
shot
straight
upward
to
stratospheric
percentile
and
stayed
there
our
public
profile
change
a
lot
the
daily
financial
press
the
wall
street
journal
and
barron
s
and
the
financial
time
kind
of
lose
interest
in
us
the
minute
we
go
private
it
be
sort
of
like
well
there
s
no
stock
anymore
so
we
don
t
care
but
the
industry
press
and
the
long
lead
time
outlet
wire
and
fortune
and
forbes
continued
to
find
drama
in
our
story
only
now
with
a
more
positive
spin
it
be
like
okay
they
won
this
epic
fight
and
now
they
ve
take
their
company
back
and
they
ve
get
this
plan
will
it
work
but
it
be
work
definitively
from
the
very
start
every
quarter
we
be
gain
share
and
pay
down
debt
much
faster
than
anybody
have
expect
include
us
cash
flow
be
strong
because
we
be
grow
again
the
new
dell
start
with
some
promising
metric
forbes
write
in
november
the
company
that
make
its
name
sell
direct
have
more
than
channel
partner
resellers
today
with
about
billion
of
dell
s
nearly
billion
in
annual
revenue
come
that
way
up
from
zero
in
it
also
double
the
number
of
sale
specialist
with
technical
training
to
in
the
past
four
year
two
out
of
three
business
customer
first
experience
with
dell
be
buying
a
pc
and
about
percent
of
those
customer
go
on
to
buy
other
product
and
service
the
trick
be
get
the
sale
force
to
cross
sell
how
far
along
be
they
on
that
effort
we
re
in
the
second
to
third
inning
say
jeff
clarke
head
of
the
pc
business
we
be
do
old
thing
differently
and
new
thing
very
differently
where
pc
be
concerned
we
be
start
to
see
proof
of
what
i
d
felt
in
my
bone
for
year
that
report
of
the
personal
computer
s
death
be
greatly
exaggerated
people
be
figure
out
that
it
wasn
t
the
pc
versus
the
smartphone
it
be
an
and
thing
not
an
or
thing
you
be
never
go
to
stop
people
from
bring
their
smartphones
to
work
and
even
do
some
work
on
them
at
home
or
the
office
some
people
but
a
lot
few
like
their
tablet
too
but
pc
be
easy
to
work
on
for
all
kind
of
reason
and
we
be
still
sell
a
lot
of
them
only
now
with
a
different
mindset
we
d
try
branching
out
there
be
our
android
phablet
the
streak
the
problem
be
not
only
that
most
of
the
profit
between
search
and
the
android
play
store
go
to
google
but
also
that
most
of
the
rest
go
to
the
component
company
that
produce
the
display
the
battery
the
memory
in
we
brought
out
a
small
smartphone
with
a
slide
out
keyboard
call
the
venue
it
be
actually
a
pretty
good
design
but
it
ran
on
window
mobile
and
after
get
beaten
on
service
and
apps
by
google
and
apple
window
mobile
be
doom
we
switch
the
device
to
android
but
there
be
no
money
to
be
make
there
either
so
here
we
be
with
our
flagship
product
pc
sale
account
for
about
percent
of
our
revenue
but
only
to
percent
of
our
profit
pc
always
be
a
low
margin
item
but
because
our
business
model
of
sell
direct
at
low
price
and
provide
the
best
support
and
service
lead
to
huge
sale
or
as
we
call
it
scale
we
become
a
major
force
and
despite
the
many
expert
loud
and
dire
prediction
of
the
death
of
the
pc
dell
would
gain
pc
share
for
seven
straight
year
twenty
eight
quarter
between
the
completion
of
the
go
private
and
the
time
of
this
write
yet
i
have
know
almost
from
the
begin
that
there
be
a
much
big
market
beyond
the
pc
from
the
early
s
on
anyone
try
to
look
ahead
could
see
that
while
actual
pc
and
server
the
physical
machine
would
continue
to
be
necessary
the
ghost
in
the
machine
software
be
go
to
dominate
technology
and
from
a
business
standpoint
software
rule
unlike
a
pc
where
the
gross
margin
be
percent
or
percent
the
gross
margin
in
a
storage
array
because
it
have
so
much
more
software
could
be
percent
and
of
course
if
you
be
sell
pure
software
your
margin
would
be
percent
because
there
s
no
cost
of
good
in
term
of
material
software
be
just
bit
the
beauty
of
software
be
this
to
develop
a
program
that
creates
a
lot
of
value
might
cost
you
million
but
you
could
sell
it
to
one
customer
or
a
million
customer
or
a
billion
customer
your
cost
to
create
it
doesn
t
change
so
it
can
be
incredibly
profitable
if
your
software
have
many
user
in
the
late
s
we
begin
to
see
pc
as
a
potential
loss
leader
a
way
to
get
in
the
door
to
upsell
software
and
service
and
we
d
actually
do
a
fair
bit
to
evolve
the
company
beyond
the
pc
and
the
fact
that
we
weren
t
get
full
credit
for
that
be
one
of
our
big
reason
for
take
the
company
private


thing
be
come
together
in
all
kind
of
way
it
begin
long
before
the
go
private
the
advent
of
the
internet
in
the
late
s
have
give
humanity
access
to
more
data
than
anyone
have
ever
imagine
by
the
early
s
the
world
of
technology
be
change
at
warp
speed
we
d
start
succeed
in
the
server
business
in
the
mid
s
and
the
high
margin
there
have
be
great
for
our
bottom
line
but
as
the
quantity
of
data
in
the
world
expand
exponentially
it
become
clearer
and
clearer
that
physical
server
alone
no
matter
how
powerful
weren
t
go
to
be
able
to
handle
it
all
a
solution
exist
already
virtualization
be
a
concept
that
predates
microprocessor
base
system
you
could
find
it
on
ibm
mainframe
back
in
the
late
s
the
idea
be
to
install
software
within
the
host
computer
that
mimicked
the
host
thus
create
any
number
of
virtual
mainframe
within
the
actual
mainframe
these
virtual
computer
isolated
from
each
other
to
prevent
contagious
crash
could
perform
specific
task
and
then
be
deactivate
or
workload
could
be
move
around
from
one
to
the
other
all
of
this
take
place
in
millisecond
and
the
actual
computer
host
could
be
thousand
of
mile
apart
as
microprocessor
become
more
powerful
more
and
more
virtual
computer
could
be
house
inside
the
mainframe
and
out
in
silicon
valley
tech
company
be
start
to
figure
out
how
to
virtualize
both
pc
and
server
a
little
palo
alto
start
up
call
vmware
be
a
pioneer
in
the
field
its
breakthrough
product
be
virtualization
software
that
let
a
user
run
multiple
operating
system
on
a
pc
you
could
work
with
both
unix
and
window
on
your
desktop
or
two
different
version
of
window
or
window
on
your
mac
system
and
in
july
vmware
become
one
of
the
first
commercially
successful
company
to
virtualize
the
x
architecture
opening
the
door
to
the
development
of
virtual
server
in
early
dell
lead
a
million
investment
in
vmware
along
with
goldman
sachs
and
several
other
partner
on
the
other
coast
a
massachusetts
base
company
call
emc
have
become
the
world
leader
in
networked
information
storage
system
emc
s
big
product
be
a
powerful
hardware
software
data
storage
array
call
symmetrix
which
be
have
great
success
among
enterprise
class
corporation
the
top
hundred
to
two
hundred
company
in
the
world
in
october
on
the
basis
of
my
longtime
friendship
with
emc
s
brilliant
ceo
joe
tucci
dell
and
emc
enter
into
a
strategic
alliance
in
a
market
that
be
project
to
reach
billion
by
i
d
first
met
joe
back
in
when
he
be
chairman
and
ceo
of
wang
laboratory
this
be
five
year
before
he
join
emc
and
i
have
great
respect
for
him
as
a
business
leader
and
strategist
i
be
thrill
to
be
work
with
him
for
emc
the
partnership
provide
a
powerful
new
distribution
channel
to
access
customer
beyond
the
enterprise
company
they
be
use
to
sell
to
because
their
product
sell
at
a
high
margin
add
dell
as
a
channel
contribute
significantly
to
emc
s
revenue
stream
it
also
help
emc
compete
well
with
other
storage
company
like
netapp
that
have
developed
sale
channel
to
sell
beyond
the
top
corporation
and
their
alignment
with
us
meant
we
would
not
align
with
netapp
or
one
of
the
other
storage
company
and
last
the
relationship
let
emc
use
dell
s
massive
procurement
power
to
help
low
their
material
cost
for
component
like
disk
drive
far
improve
their
margin
for
dell
the
alliance
allow
us
to
add
emc
s
high
perform
storage
product
to
our
rapidly
grow
server
business
it
give
us
an
important
new
customer
as
emc
agree
to
use
our
server
inside
their
storage
system
and
it
help
us
move
far
into
the
data
center
of
those
enterprise
customer
and
position
both
us
and
emc
to
advance
on
our
mutual
competitor
the
server
and
storage
business
of
ibm
compaq
and
hp
then
in
january
emc
bought
vmware
they
would
later
take
it
public
in
reduce
their
ownership
to
percent
the
use
to
be
palo
alto
start
up
be
now
so
much
more
vmware
s
progress
in
virtualizing
the
server
be
such
that
by
the
mid
s
if
you
work
in
a
company
that
have
server
and
you
weren
t
use
virtualization
you
be
totally
do
it
wrong
it
be
like
a
corporate
iq
test
it
be
so
valuable
and
so
easy
and
vmware
be
take
off
like
wildfire
the
press
release
for
the
purchase
say
vmware
will
play
a
key
role
in
emc
s
strategy
to
help
customer
low
their
cost
and
simplify
their
operation
by
deploy
virtualization
technology
across
their
heterogeneous
it
infrastructure
to
create
a
single
pool
of
available
storage
and
compute
resource
translation
vmware
s
virtualizing
capability
have
move
from
the
pc
and
the
server
to
storage
networking
and
security
aka
heterogeneous
it
infrastructure
aka
the
cloud
buying
vmware
turn
out
to
be
an
unbelievably
smart
investment
on
joe
tucci
s
part
as
do
form
that
alliance
with
dell
the
problem
for
us
be
that
emc
with
its
high
margin
and
its
big
footprint
among
top
company
be
reap
most
of
the
profit
that
begin
to
worry
me
and
set
me
think
about
then
make
our
first
major
acquisition
the
storage
company
equallogic
in
on
the
face
of
it
equallogic
seem
like
a
great
buy
for
us
the
company
have
be
grow
very
fast
they
be
get
ready
to
go
public
they
d
already
print
a
prospectus
they
have
a
great
elegantly
engineer
product
gear
to
the
low
mid
range
of
storage
customer
far
from
the
sweet
spot
where
emc
tend
to
play
so
we
felt
we
could
acquire
equallogic
without
destroy
the
emc
relationship
and
it
would
give
us
some
of
our
own
intellectual
property
which
we
could
sell
at
attractive
margin
i
remember
go
over
to
our
lab
where
we
have
a
team
test
and
evaluate
several
of
the
storage
platform
then
on
the
market
now
the
thing
about
engineer
be
that
they
tend
to
think
they
can
engineer
everything
themselves
if
we
d
told
them
we
want
to
build
a
mid
range
storage
platform
they
would
ve
say
okay
we
ll
go
do
that
but
to
do
that
be
much
harder
than
it
sound
so
they
be
look
at
other
company
platform
and
the
choice
have
come
down
to
three
one
of
which
be
equallogic
s
i
remember
i
be
talk
to
seven
of
our
engineer
that
day
and
i
put
this
question
to
them
okay
suppose
you
have
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
and
you
can
either
put
it
in
the
bank
and
let
it
earn
interest
for
ten
year
or
you
can
put
it
in
the
equallogic
ipo
but
you
can
t
sell
for
ten
year
what
do
you
do
and
six
of
the
seven
say
they
would
put
their
in
equallogic
even
though
they
hadn
t
create
the
platform
themselves
after
that
i
say
okay
we
re
buying
equallogic
and
we
snatch
it
right
out
of
the
hand
of
the
market
before
it
go
public
for
billion
that
s
a
lot
of
money
anytime
and
it
be
certainly
a
lot
for
us
then
just
month
after
i
d
step
back
in
as
ceo
and
while
we
be
still
a
public
company
with
our
shareholder
watch
our
every
move
very
carefully
and
under
that
harsh
spotlight
equallogic
pose
an
interest
problem
we
could
buy
a
company
that
have
a
great
product
and
million
in
sale
and
by
the
sheer
strength
of
our
broad
customer
relationship
we
could
grow
it
to
or
or
million
maybe
even
billion
in
revenue
in
revenue
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
maybe
just
a
couple
of
year
you
could
make
these
acquisition
pay
off
pretty
quickly
and
handsomely
the
challenge
be
that
after
reach
a
certain
height
these
acquisition
tend
to
kind
of
level
off
and
stay
in
their
lane
to
acquire
a
company
that
have
be
number
six
or
seven
in
its
field
and
take
it
to
number
two
or
three
or
even
vault
it
to
number
one
be
almost
impossible
company
with
leadership
position
if
they
continue
to
invest
and
serve
their
customer
well
be
hard
to
unseat
it
s
not
impossible
but
it
rarely
occurs
meanwhile
i
kept
think
about
emc
and
vmware
who
together
be
well
on
the
way
to
become
the
most
important
company
in
the
it
infrastructure
universe
and
so
i
call
joe
tucci
and
ask
him
what
he
thought
about
a
complete
merger
of
dell
and
emc
joe
thought
it
could
be
a
great
thing
arguably
the
big
tech
merger
ever
so
in
and
we
explore
it
we
meant
joe
and
i
and
our
respective
executive
leadership
and
board
of
director
along
with
investment
banker
consultant
and
lawyer
we
have
bain
and
mckinsey
on
either
side
with
detailed
analysis
and
hundred
of
slide
and
we
have
code
name
emc
be
emerald
and
dell
be
diamond
and
we
would
meet
in
obscure
hotel
in
unlikely
city
place
where
nobody
would
recognize
us
we
even
have
joint
meeting
of
both
company
board
then
the
financial
crisis
come
along
and
suddenly
nobody
be
talk
about
merger
anymore


our
early
day
as
a
private
company
be
go
even
well
than
i
d
anticipate
but
my
business
be
where
i
could
exert
control
my
life
have
other
plan
my
mom
fought
so
bravely
for
five
year
after
her
cancer
come
back
susan
nickname
her
mama
warrior
but
by
january
it
be
clear
that
she
have
lose
her
battle
she
left
md
anderson
in
houston
and
go
home
under
the
care
of
hospice
nurse
she
die
there
on
the
day
before
valentine
s
day
the
good
thing
if
there
be
a
good
thing
be
that
we
be
all
with
her
in
those
last
few
day
everybody
get
to
say
goodbye
and
she
told
us
what
to
do
for
the
next
fifty
year
a
force
of
nature
undone
by
nature
i
ve
never
have
a
well
adviser
when
i
spoke
at
her
funeral
i
say
i
be
my
mother
s
son
she
be
happy
positive
and
very
smart
always
smile
bold
and
fierce
she
never
told
us
what
to
do
but
because
of
her
we
knew
what
to
do
she
knew
what
my
brother
and
i
need
at
every
point
in
our
life
she
taught
us
we
could
do
anything
she
fuel
our
creativity
curiosity
and
desire
to
learn
experiment
and
pursue
our
passion
she
taught
us
to
respect
all
people
but
choose
wisely
the
one
we
spend
our
time
with
to
share
and
to
love
and
take
care
of
each
other
she
give
us
everything
we
need
and
much
more
boy
do
i
get
lucky
dell
can
t
lose
be
the
title
of
a
forbes
cover
story
that
come
out
around
then
about
my
business
success
in
general
and
the
success
of
the
go
private
in
particular
those
be
nice
word
to
read
but
the
truth
be
that
in
life
we
all
lose
dearly
when
we
lose
our
love
one
and
no
amount
of
worldly
success
make
up
for
it


talk
about
compartmentalization
i
continued
to
feel
deep
sadness
about
my
mom
but
at
the
same
time
i
kept
feel
excite
by
our
progress
as
a
newly
private
company
and
i
let
myself
feel
that
way
because
i
knew
mom
would
ve
be
excite
too
we
be
continue
to
gain
share
and
pay
down
debt
cash
kept
flow
in
we
be
incur
a
lot
more
volatility
than
a
typical
public
company
but
that
be
because
of
all
the
investment
we
be
make
some
of
which
paid
off
quickly
some
slowly
and
some
not
at
all
these
be
move
we
couldn
t
have
make
easily
as
a
public
company
shareholder
would
ve
hat
all
those
ups
and
down
but
now
with
the
time
and
perspective
that
go
private
have
give
us
we
could
enjoy
the
fact
that
though
our
earnings
be
up
and
down
the
general
trend
be
up
up
up
just
a
few
month
into
the
go
private
and
feel
very
confident
about
our
progress
egon
durban
and
i
start
talk
about
thing
we
could
do
beyond
organic
internal
investment
to
far
accelerate
the
company
s
transformation
we
have
a
number
of
new
acquisition
in
mind
mostly
in
software
but
the
big
boldest
brightest
prize
egon
and
i
agree
would
be
emc
vmware
egon
have
heard
through
some
banker
that
a
couple
of
big
company
be
consider
acquire
emc
effectively
put
it
in
play
we
didn
t
know
anything
more
specific
at
the
time
but
i
found
the
possibility
of
acquire
it
ourselves
intensely
interest
emc
consist
of
three
large
business
and
several
small
one
the
three
large
business
would
combine
beautifully
with
us
there
be
emc
information
infrastructure
which
be
the
undisputed
leader
in
the
data
storage
system
sector
and
would
meld
perfectly
with
our
server
vmware
the
virtualization
pioneer
which
kept
find
new
way
to
obviate
physical
machine
and
the
software
development
start
up
pivotal
spun
out
of
emc
and
vmware
which
create
a
platform
to
develop
cloud
software
pivotal
s
ceo
paul
maritz
formerly
the
ceo
of
vmware
be
a
brilliant
guy
whose
technical
input
and
advice
i
often
rely
on
put
dell
and
emc
together
would
create
an
unbelievably
strong
company
but
be
it
even
possible
the
frustration
of
our
scrubbed
merger
have
stayed
with
me
for
five
year
as
both
dell
and
emc
built
strength
on
strength
in
system
storage
and
security
i
kept
feel
we
d
miss
a
huge
opportunity
to
combine
two
complementary
number
one
and
create
a
kind
of
tech
dream
team
that
summer
egon
and
i
begin
talk
about
revisit
the
idea
it
seem
like
a
natural
progression
for
us
not
only
do
our
alliance
with
emc
go
way
back
it
be
also
a
rare
opportunity
in
that
emc
and
vmware
be
the
clear
number
one
in
their
industry
segment
as
i
mention
it
s
very
hard
to
dramatically
change
the
share
position
of
a
company
so
buying
a
number
two
or
number
five
business
which
be
the
one
that
be
usually
for
sale
be
a
much
more
difficult
way
to
succeed
usually
number
one
business
aren
t
for
sale
or
the
price
be
exorbitant
or
they
be
part
of
an
even
large
company
that
isn
t
acquirable
i
be
thrill
by
the
idea
of
combine
dell
with
emc
and
vmware
and
egon
felt
the
same
way
it
would
be
a
merger
of
unprecedented
size
one
that
would
immediately
create
the
world
s
premier
company
in
it
infrastructure
with
the
best
product
and
technology
and
the
great
scale
and
it
would
fit
our
dell
s
and
emc
s
customer
need
perfectly
our
combine
force
would
be
able
to
help
customer
as
never
before
and
win
big
at
the
same
time
our
customer
need
and
want
our
help
with
digital
information
advance
at
head
spin
speed
they
couldn
t
afford
to
dedicate
all
their
time
to
learn
how
to
use
all
the
new
technology
software
data
artificial
intelligence
machine
learn
neural
network
to
build
their
competitive
advantage
they
didn
t
want
to
be
system
integrator
the
way
i
envision
it
the
incredible
set
of
capability
across
dell
emc
vmware
and
pivotal
could
create
platform
that
would
let
customer
take
advantage
of
the
new
technology
in
an
integrate
and
automate
way
but
be
dell
itself
ready
for
this
huge
step
up
real
transformation
of
major
tech
company
be
extremely
rare
i
think
because
company
develop
a
particular
capability
and
a
set
of
customer
and
change
be
hard
you
can
t
take
the
stripe
off
a
tiger
if
you
re
born
a
dog
you
don
t
die
a
cat
yet
transformation
be
very
much
on
my
mind
in
we
hadn
t
lift
dell
to
an
industry
lead
position
by
play
it
safe
we
hadn
t
take
the
company
private
to
play
it
safe
to
keep
up
with
the
explosive
growth
of
data
and
maintain
leadership
a
tech
company
have
to
be
ready
to
break
precedent
to
make
bold
move
on
a
world
class
scale
we
be
ready
i
be
ready
and
so
that
august
i
call
joe
tucci
and
ask
how
he
felt
about
a
combination
of
our
company
in
the
form
of
an
acquisition
by
dell
when
we
d
first
explore
merge
back
in
and
we
d
still
be
a
publicly
held
company
now
that
we
d
go
private
i
told
joe
the
process
would
be
much
easy
since
i
be
dell
s
control
shareholder
and
have
a
very
supportive
partner
in
silver
lake
on
the
other
hand
i
acknowledge
that
since
emc
s
market
capitalization
stood
at
around
billion
an
acquisition
be
a
very
tall
order
both
financially
and
culturally
for
a
private
company
from
texas
to
buy
the
large
public
company
in
massachusetts
be
far
from
a
slam
dunk
but
joe
be
motivate
and
receptive
he
be
in
his
late
sixty
and
have
want
for
a
while
to
retire
yet
he
d
put
it
off
several
time
because
he
didn
t
see
a
clear
successor
within
emc
a
merger
lead
by
dell
would
make
me
his
successor
it
would
also
add
capability
that
emc
need
joe
have
realize
that
the
industry
be
change
and
just
be
a
storage
company
without
a
server
company
be
not
a
good
long
term
strategy
yet
while
joe
like
and
trust
me
as
much
as
i
like
and
trust
him
the
decision
because
emc
be
publicly
held
ultimately
belong
to
its
board
of
director
typically
the
ceo
will
make
a
recommendation
but
as
be
the
case
with
our
go
private
the
board
have
a
real
duty
of
responsibility
to
get
the
high
value
for
shareholder
and
to
make
sure
all
the
alternative
be
explore
include
remain
an
independent
company
do
we
sell
off
a
part
of
the
company
do
we
do
a
share
buyback
let
s
find
any
possible
buyer
but
maybe
we
stay
independent
the
board
have
to
consider
all
the
option
confidentiality
prevent
joe
from
talk
with
me
about
the
other
suitor
but
investment
banker
who
be
under
no
such
stricture
and
who
be
always
eager
to
stir
up
a
deal
they
might
be
able
to
profit
from
have
whisper
in
my
ear
and
in
egon
s
ear
who
those
suitor
there
be
two
of
them
just
might
be
and
what
make
the
whole
thing
really
interest
be
that
if
either
of
the
two
beat
us
out
it
be
go
to
be
a
real
problem
for
us


the
silicon
valley
networking
giant
cisco
system
market
cap
as
of
april
billion
express
an
early
interest
in
acquire
emc
yet
from
the
begin
it
be
clear
that
cisco
have
its
own
issue
to
deal
with
for
one
thing
the
company
be
in
the
midst
of
restructuring
and
have
laid
off
several
thousand
employee
worldwide
for
another
though
cisco
have
announce
a
new
focus
on
the
internet
of
thing
and
have
bought
several
company
to
far
that
initiative
they
really
didn
t
have
a
history
of
make
large
acquisition
they
d
always
be
pretty
cautious
in
that
regard
their
most
recent
purchase
the
security
hardware
software
company
sourcefire
have
cost
them
billion
acquire
emc
stood
to
cost
twenty
to
thirty
time
that
much
a
far
complication
be
that
cisco
s
ceo
john
chamber
who
d
once
work
for
joe
tucci
at
wang
be
himself
on
the
verge
of
retire
and
may
have

a
precursor
to
vxrail
the
hyperconverged
infrastructure
appliance
that
would
become
a
huge
success
over
billion
in
sale
for
both
of
us
and
that
be
just
the
begin
as
the
briefing
document
for
my
meeting
with
pat
say
there
have
be
consistent
dell
senior
executive
interaction
with

in
the
past
year
with
a
strong
focus
on
drive
joint
solution
and
strengthen
our
engineering
and
sale
relationship
our
long
stand
partnership
also
face
challenge
pat
s

s
expansion
of
its
management
software
portfolio
and
bundling
of

title
into

create
some
tension
and

few
dell

experience

reach
but
both
pat
and
i
felt
the
advantage
of
our
collaboration
far
outweigh
the
challenge
i
left
with
the
feel
that
vmware
s
relationship
with
emc
and
dell
be
solid
and
likely
to
stay
so
a
crucial
foundation
for
the
merger
that
i
still
hadn
t
breathe
a
word
about
to
anyone
except
joe
tucci
and
egon
durban


in
an
ordinary
year
the
kind
we
use
to
have
before

get
extraordinary
i
ll
spend
about
a
hundred
day
on
the
road
for
business
a
lot
of
mile
a
lot
of
time
away
from
home
fortunately
i
love
my
work
love
meeting
with
customer
and
partner
and
supplier
and
with
team
member
all
over
the
world
and
i
m
naturally
curious
go
new
place
and
see
new
thing
be
thrill
to
me
in
a
lot
of
way
i
m
still
the
same
guy
i
be
in
when
i
take
that
first
big
trip
to
the
far
east
and
felt
excite
every
minute
of
every
hour
of
every
day
but
i
be
twenty
year
old
in
and
i
m
not
twenty
anymore
health
wasn
t
something
i
thought
a
lot
about
then
but
i
certainly
think
a
good
deal
about
it
now
i
ve
have
a
number
of
colleague
and
friend
who
die
young
and
i
want
to
do
all
i
can
to
stay
healthy
as
long
as
i
can
for
the
sake
of
my
family
my
business
and
myself
if
you
don
t
have
your
health
then
all
else
be
lose
i
see
health
as
a
kind
of
hierarchy
whose
foundation
be
sleep
think
about
it
if
you
couldn
t
exercise
for
a
month
you
might
be
unhappy
but
you
could
do
it
if
you
couldn
t
eat
for
a
week
or
two
you
d
be
uncomfortable
but
as
long
as
you
could
stay
hydrate
you
d
get
through
it
but
if
you
couldn
t
sleep
for
three
day
you
d
be
in
bad
shape
sleep
isn
t
always
an
easy
thing
when
you
re
cross
time
zone
and
i
cross
a
lot
of
time
zone
over
the
year
i
ve
developed
some
method
for
get
the
best
sleep
possible
while
i
travel
a
bag
of
trick
if
you
will
one
of
them
if
you
re
go
someplace
that
s
many
time
zone
away
be
go
to
sleep
earlier
and
earlier
for
two
or
three
night
ahead
of
the
trip
another
trick
once
you
ve
arrive
be
to
get
up
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
exercise
do
not
under
any
circumstance
and
i
ve
learn
this
the
hard
way
once
or
twice
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
day
or
the
late
afternoon
or
you
ll
totally
screw
yourself
up
put
yourself

a
dinner
bell
this
be
friday
night
september
on
sunday
morning
after
i
d
return
to
austin
my
eye
go
straight
to
a
headline
on
the
wall
street
journal
s
homepage
emc
weighs
merger
other
option
press
by
activist
and
with
ceo
expect
to
retire
data
storage
giant
reach
crossroad
well
i
thought
this
be
pretty
interest
the
piece
begin
emc
for
nearly
a
year
held
off
and
on
merger
discussion
with
hewlett
packard
co
though
those
talk
recently
end
accord
to
people
familiar
with
the
matter
it
isn
t
clear
whether
the
talk
could
be
revive
another
company
that
have
recently
held
talk
with
emc
be
dell
inc
people
familiar
with
the
matter
say
it
isn
t
clear
where
any
talk
between
the
two
company
stand
give
their
relative
size
it
be
unlikely
dell
would
contemplate
a
full
takeover
of
emc
and
might
instead
seek
to
purchase
asset
include
its
core
storage
business
one
of
the
people
say
the
deal
emc
and
hewlett
packard
discuss
would
have
be
a
blockbuster
in
part
give
that
the
two
company
have
a
combine
market
value
of
nearly
billion
the
deal
they
contemplate
would
have
be
an
all
stock
transaction
bill
as
a
merger
of
equal
one
person
familiar
with
the
matter
say
people
familiar
with
the
matter
one
person
familiar
with
the
matter
i
be
pretty
sure
who
these
familiar
people
be
some
unscrupulous
investment
banker
or
banker
eager
to
stir
up
a
deal
they
could
profit
from
or
someone
from
elliott
eager
to
stir
up
a
deal
they
could
profit
from
or
both
in
any
case
the
buzz
i
d
heard
about
hp
have
be
correct
and
what
joe
tucci
hadn
t
be
able
to
tell
me
in
late
august
when
i
call
him
about
a
merger
be
that
meg
whitman
be
on
the
brink
of
beating
me
to
the
punch
as
i
later
discover
meg
first
call
joe
about
a
possible
hewlett
packard
purchase
of
emc
in
november
of
soon
after
our
go
private
be
finally
approve
she
have
to
have
wonder
why
we
weren
t
pursue
a
purchase
ourselves
maybe
she
thought
the
go
private
be
distract
us
the
hp
emc
talk
proceed
through
much
of
and
go
very
well
what
the
two
company
work
out
be
a
stock
for
stock
deal
instead
of
spending
and
borrowing
to
acquire
emc
hp
would
let
emc
s
stockholder
trade
their
share
for
hp
share
on
a
one
to
one
basis
humongous
pile
of
equity
and
debt
not
need
when
the
dust
settle
all
the
share
would
be
combine
to
create
a
giant
new
company
one
fully
capable
of
besting
us
in
the
s
sector
service
software
storage
server
security
we
d
be
work
so
hard
to
succeed
in
hp
and
emc
have
a
handshake
agreement
and
then
at
the
last
minute
they
didn
t
as
i
heard
it
at
the
eleventh
hour
hp
say
in
effect
our
stock
should
be
at
a
five
percent
premium
to
your
stock
because
we
ve
get
a
well
business
than
you
which
felt
like
a
breach
of
trust
to
the
emc
board
game
over
what
would
ve
be
a
blockbuster
deal
and
a
blockbuster
merger
create
a
mega
company
that
would
have
rule
the
cloud
infrastructure
and
security
sector
and
give
us
some
serious
difficulty
be
suddenly
no
more
and
ultimately
i
think
hp
lose
the
deal
over
a
relatively
trivial
sum
of
money
as
much
as
i
like
and
admire
meg
whitman
i
feel
this
be
a
monumental
blunder
on
her
part


whether
or
not
a
shady
investment
banker
have
plant
the
wsj
piece
to
get
some
action

day
after
the

i
call
joe
tucci
again
to
talk
about
the
brand

landscape
in
which
we
now
found
ourselves
the
call
have
be
schedule
for
fifteen
minute
but
joe
and
i
stayed
on
the
phone
for
much
longer
as
we
begin
to
address
how
we
might
deal
with
the
considerable
challenge
that
lay
before
us
for
one
thing
we
agree
that
as
we
move
forward
deepest
secrecy
would
be
of
the
essence
the
code
name
be
roll
out
again
we
be
denali
emc
be
emerald
vmware
be
verdite
the
merger
be
project
emerald
as
i
recall
that
time
the
summer
of
to
the
fall
of
i
m
remind
that
in
practically
every
meeting
i
have
with
key
customer
and
partner
i
be
think
but
not
say
do
the
combination
with
emc
and
vmware
make
sense
how
will
these
customer
and
partner
react
how
will
our
team
react
what
will
work
well
and
what
challenge
might
we
experience
and
in
all
those
meeting
i
be
probe
deeply
in
every
way
i
could
for
answer
to
these
question
all
the
while
try
my
hardest
not
to
give
any
signal
the
potential
merger
be
much
like
the
go
private
the
ultimate
consider
decision
something
you
think
about
for
a
long
time
and
very
carefully
before
decide
to
proceed

harry
you
and
the
bolt
from
the
blue
on
october
meg
whitman
announce
she
be
do
the
very
thing
she
d
pledge
not
to
do
three
year
earlier
when
she
assume
leadership
of
hewlett
packard
splitting
the
company
in
two
hp
inc
would
contain
the
still
profitable
pc
and
printer
business
hewlett
packard
enterprise
which
meg
would
lead
would
house
the
company
s
server
storage
networking
software
and
service
the
very
area
that
a
merger
with
emc
would
have
complement
and
magnify
it
be
hard
not
to
see
the
move
as
a
far
diminishment
of
a
once
great
company
and
now
with
cisco
also
out
of
the
run
we
have
a
clear
track
to
do
the
merger
ourselves
again
if
we
could
figure
out
how
the
hell
to
do
it
joe
tucci
and
i
spoke
on
the
phone
several
more
time
in
the
late
fall
and
then
we
plan
to
meet
in
january
when
we
be
both
to
attend
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
in
hawaii
the
day
after
christmas
egon
and
i
take
another
long
walk
on
the
trail
along
the
shore
follow
the
same
route
we
d
take
two
year
earlier
when
we
first
discuss
the
go
private
so
much
have
happen
in
the
interim
and
there
be
so
much
to
talk
about
now
but
of
course
our
relationship
have
completely
change
over
those
two
year
back
then
egon
be
just
a
smart
guy
whose
idea
about
take
dell
private
i
want
to
sound
out
now
he
be
a
good
friend
and
deeply
trust
business
partner
for
the
first
little
while
as
we
set
out
we
talk
about
the
thing
friend
talk
about
how
his
three
kid
considerably
young
than
mine
and
my
four
be
do
how
his
christmas
have
be
we
d
just
finish
celebrate
hanukkah
on
the
twenty
fourth
we
discuss
the
recent
big
hack
of
sony
picture
possibly
by
north
korea
and
sony
s
withdrawal
of
the
controversial
film
the
interview
from
theater
and
naturally
we
both
wonder
aloud
what
opportunity
the
impend
split
of
hp
into
two
company
might
create
from
there
it
be
a
natural
transition
into
talk
over
the
in
and
out
of
the
big
merger
what
could
go
right
and
what
might
go
wrong
what
revenue
growth
opportunity
combine
the
two
business
could
create
what
obstacle
still
stood
in
our
path
and
there
be
still
considerable
obstacle
how
might
our
respective
customer
and
partner
react
to
the
acquisition
how
might
our
competitor
react
who
else
among
possible
financial
buyer
or
strategic
suitor
tech
competitor
or
both
might
show
up
with
a
high
bid
what
effect
could
an
intervention
by
an
activist
elliott
or
someone
else
have
and
continue
a
still
complicate
and
difficult
theme
how
could
this
deal
be
finance
the
beautiful
crash
surf
and
serene
blue
sky
seem
to
say
life
be
simple
enjoy
it
but
both
egon
and
i
knew
that
as
true
as
this
might
appear
on
a
seaside
trail
on
a
post
christmas
day
in
hawaii
the
trail
ahead
be
go
to
be
hard


despite
the
many
reporter
and
photographer
cover
davos
joe
and
i
manage
to
find
an
unused
meeting
room
where
we
could
talk
without
attract
any
attention
in
early
march
we
met
again
while
we
attend
a
technology
ceo
council
meeting
in
dc
the
topic
joe
and
i
hash
over
be
always
the
same
what
revenue
and
cost
synergy
would
a
merger
of
our
two
organization
create
what
would
vmware
s
role
in
the
new
company
be
what
role
would
the
cultural
difference
between
boston
base
emc
silicon
valley
base
vmware
and
austin
base
dell
play
how
might
this
huge
transaction
be
leveraged
and
which
leader
among
both
company
team
would
be
best
able
to
execute
our
strategy
recognize
that
it
be
time
to
take
our
discussion
beyond
one
to
one
we
plan
an
early
april
meeting
at
my
house
in
austin
to
protect
confidentiality
which
besides
joe
and
me
would
include
egon
bill
green
an
emc
board
member
and
former
ceo
of
the
technology
consult
company
accenture
and
harry
you
an
emc
executive
vice
president
in
charge
of
corporate
strategy
and
former
oracle
cfo
on
april
good
friday
we
all
convene
over
the
course
of
the
five
hour
meeting
the
seriousness
of
the
discussion
go
up
another
notch
though
there
be
a
nice
break
from
the
intensity
when
zach
clearly
intrigue
by
this
high
level
conference
popped
his
head
in
to
say
hi
we
be
begin
to
get
on
top
of
revenue
and
cost
synergy
we
d
always
thought
there
would
be
far
more
of
the
former
than
the
latter
but
it
turn
out
that
the
revenue
synergy
between
the
two
company
would
be
even
great
than
we
have
estimate
but
there
be
still
a
financial
problem
combine
all
the
equity
and
debt
we
could
anticipate
be
able
to
put
together
we
still
couldn
t
afford
to
buy
all
of
emc
s
percent
stake
in
vmware
still
egon
a
strong
presence
with
a
track
record
of
big
success
at
silver
lake
say
he
be
very
optimistic
that
one
way
or
another
we
would
get
it
do
when
we
adjourn
joe
and
bill
head
back
to
boston
and
egon
and
harry
flew
back
to
california
and
as
egon
later
told
me
he
and
harry
be
chew
the
financing
question
over
and
over
when
harry
suddenly
say
there
s
something
else
we
could
try
back
in
general
motor
seek
a
foothold
in
the
technological
future
want
to
acquire
ross
perot
s
company
electronic
data
system
both
to
help
standardize
the
automaker
s
diverse
computer
system
and
to
be
in
ed
s
health
care
and
payroll
automation
business
but
the
deal
hit
an
initial
roadblock
when
gm
propose
pay
ed
in
part
with
general
motor
common
stock
perot
and
his
team
see
their
company
as
a
nimble
high
growth
high
tech
trendsetter
be
reluctant
to
combine
their
financial
fortune
with
those
of
a
slow
growth
old
line
automotive
company
what
especially
worried
them
be
that
gm
be
so
enormous
that
ed
s
success
go
forward
would
be
lose
in
the
mix

not

to

and
build

it
allow

jump
ahead

profitable
but
stormy
be

gm
want
to
unload
its

now
worth
billion
without

harry

then
a
young
investment
banker
at
lehman
brother
be
tasked
with
help
to
come
up
with
a
solution
to
this
problem
general

ultimately
solve
it
by
give
the
track
stock
to
the
gm
hourly
rate
pension
plan
in
the
process
harry
become
a
student
of
the
strange
financial
instrument
know
as
the
track
stock
fast
forward
twenty
year
with
harry
you
and
egon
durban
fly
west
on
egon
s
plane
and
try
to
figure
out
how
dell
inc
could
come
up
with
billion
to
merge
with
emc
somewhere
over
the
southwest
harry
remember
gm
and
ed
what
if
harry
say
we
be
to
issue
a
new
class
of
stock
for
vmware
one
that
didn
t
reflect
ownership
in
the
business
but
instead
tracked
the
company
s
performance
we
could
then
sweeten
the
consideration
paid
to
emc
stockholder
in
the
deal
by
add
vmware
track
share
to
their
emc
share
egon
be
very
excite
by
the
idea
so
much
so
that
he
and
harry
start
sketch
out
then
and
there
on
the
plane
on
paper
napkin
how
a
vmware
track
stock
could
work
in
a
dell
emc
combination
and
because
we
d
be
collaborate
on
the
idea
steadily
for
six
month
really
work
arm
in
arm
as
partner
egon
phone
me
from
his
car
the
moment
he
land
and
very
excitedly
told
me
about
harry
you
s
bolt
from
the
blue
i
knew
a
little
bit
about
track
stock
i
remember
the
gm
class
e
stock
because
i
d
study
ross
perot
s
story
pretty
extensively
but
i
didn
t
completely
comprehend
the
concept
so
i
go
to
school
on
it
this
be
my
way
i
tend
to
keep
burrowing
in
on
a
topic
until
i
feel
i
understand
it
thoroughly
sometimes
that
take
a
lot
of
burrowing
i
go
online
and
to
my
bloomberg
terminal
read
everything
i
could
about
this
peculiar
financial
instrument
and
the
company
that
have
use
it
i
found
all
sort
of
paper
online
from
finance
professor
about
the
pro
and
con
of
track
stock
and
i
begin
to
feel
somewhat
optimistic
that
the
everest
of
this
gigantic
merger
might
be
a
mountain
we
be
capable
of
climb
i
be
go
all
out
to
understand
emc
and
vmware
from
every
angle
probe
deeply
to
find
any
point
of
weakness
any
overlook
aspect
anything
i
didn
t
know
about
i
assemble
a
list
of
the
most
senior
executive
that
have
left
emc
in
recent
year
and
found
a
way
to
meet
with
many
of
them
one
on
one
in
order
to
find
out
more
about
the
company
often
the
state
purpose
of
the
meeting
be
about
a
job
opportunity
at
dell
and
in
one
or
two
case
we
actually
hire
the
person
still
it
wouldn
t
be
uncommon
for
me
to
meet
with
executive
even
when
we
didn
t
have
a
job
open
to
get
to
know
them
in
case
an
opportunity
do
come
up
i
routinely
keep
track
of
great
talent
in
our
industry
both
inside
and
outside
of
our
company
why
not
simply
avoid
all
these
machination
why
not
i
can
hear
you
ask
just
buy
up
a
few
storage
and
virtualization
start
ups
and
integrate
them
into
dell
the
process
know
in
the
tech
world
as
the
string
of
pearl
strategy
it
would
cost
vastly
less
than
acquire
emc
and
vmware
true
both
company
have
incredibly
strong
position
in
the
storage
and
virtualization
sector
but
there
be
plenty
of
challenger
out
there
legion
of
start
ups
that
be
gun
to
topple
them
sand
hill
road
the
street
in
silicon
valley
whose
name
have
come
to
stand
for
the
many
venture
capitalist
headquarter
there
and
as
famous
in
the
tech
sector
as
wall
street
be
in
finance
be
still
funding
lot
of
new
start
ups
in
storage
and
emc
would
often
acquire
them
as
they
get
large
while
there
be
merit
to
this
approach
a
form
of
r
d
by
acquisition
it
have
its
limitation
for
one
thing
it
be
very
expensive
stockholder
could
rightly
feel
it
be
dilute
the
value
of
their
share
it
also
seem
to
me
that
for
the
industry
to
consolidate
and
all
sign
be
point
toward
the
inevitability
of
consolidation
a
lead
company
would
in
some
way
need
to
emerge
with
the
scale
and
organic
innovation
capability
the
r
d
strength
to
create
successive
generation
of
lead
product
yes
there
be
a
role
for
internal
innovation
and
yes
there
be
a
role
for
small
acquisition
but
the
reason
sand
hill
road
kept
backing
new
storage
start
ups
sometimes
at
unicorn
valuation
be
that
they
be
likely
either
to
get
acquire
by
a
large
company
usually
emc
itself
or
go
public
with
an
ipo
yet
the
world
turn
the
industry
change
and
over
time
sand
hill
road
move
on
to
funding
other
trendy
area
customer
be
always
the
ultimate
judge
and
jury
and
though
there
be
threat
to
vmware
from
emerge
company
and
technology
pat
and
the
vmware
team
do
a
great
job
innovate
and
make
their
own
acquisition
to
retain
the
company
s
competitive
edge
still
as
part
of
my
very
consider
decision
make
process
i
met
with
each
of
the
company
planning
to
challenge
both
emc
and
vmware
to
see
if
a
string
of
pearl
plan
might
make
any
sense
and
what
i
found
be
that
while
some
of
these
start
ups
have
interest
idea
they
be
far
from
be
able
to
deliver
them
at
scale
nor
do
they
show
any
evidence
of
be
able
to
integrate
well
with
each
other
and
there
be
another
problem
all
these
company
be
lose
enormous
sum
of
money
their
vc
backer
be
willing
for
the
moment
to
keep
backing
and
funding
their
loss
at
the
same
time
they
be
value
astronomically
and
our
acquisition
strategy
to
date
have
already
taught
me
that
it
be
highly
unlikely
you
could
acquire
a
bunch
of
start
ups
that
would
challenge
an
industry
leader
like
emc
vmware
emc
and
vmware
s
price
tag
have
a
lot
of
zero
on
it
but
relative
to
the
company
current
cash
flow
and
our
projection
of
their
future
profitability
that
valuation
seem
like
a
bargain

pioneer
in
develop
the
leveraged
finance
market
in
the
us
and
have
almost
single
handedly
create
the
modern
syndicate
loan
market
with
his
slick
back
gray
hair
apple
cheek
and
ready
wit
jimmy
be
just
one
of
those
large
than
life
character
brilliant
and
ebullient
and
excite
to
be
around
on
thursday
may
jimmy
egon
and
i
have
a
long
and
detailed
call
about
the
challenge
we
still
face
in
financing
the
deal
jimmy
always
upbeat
saw
possibility
rather
than
roadblock
he
laid
out
his
view
of
how
it
could
all
come
together
silver
lake
and
i
include
msd
capital
the
firm
that
handle
my
family
s
investment
could
put
in
or
billion
dollar
in
equity
the
vmware
track
stock
would
offset
about
billion
he
also
mention
temasek
a
sovereign
wealth
fund
that
handle
investment
for
the
government
of
singapore
and
one
of
the
major
investor
in
our
go
private
as
a
possible
source
of
equity
but
that
still
left
us
need
to
borrow
some
billion
an
unprecedented
amount
how
could
we
persuade
bank
to
lend
us
what
we
need
at
a
rate
that
wouldn
t
prove
onerous
and
how
could
we
convince
emc
s
board
that
the
deal
be
worth
do
the
bank
didn
t
worry
jimmy
at
all
trust
me
we
ll
be
able
to
syndicate
the
loan
he
say
what
be
really
important
now
he
continued
be
persuade
the
emc
board
make
them
see
that
emc
s
business
and
dell
s
business
be
highly
complementary
that
the
merger
be
about
growth
and
new
opportunity
and
that
austin
and
boston
could
play
nicely
together
they
want
reassurance
jimmy
say
they
re
the
big
public
company
in
massachusetts
and
you
re
a
private
company
from
texas
how
be
this
go
to
work
be
you
go
to
create
a
lot
of
problem
their
board
have
many
responsibility
of
course
the
first
one
be
to
get
the
best
price
it
can
for
shareholder
but
they
also
think
about
their
own
legacy
they
want
a
good
outcome
for
the
company
and
their
people
over
the
long
run
tell
them
you
plan
to
get
an
apartment
in
boston
jimmy
told
me
tell
them
you
ll
be
spending
some
serious
time
there
you
re
go
to
do
everything
you
can
to
make
sure
it
work
they
ll
like
hearing
that
i
thought
that
be
a
great
idea
and
i
told
him
so
i
remember
that
as
we
be
wind
up
the
call
jimmy
say
he
be
about
to
go
surf
with
his
son
he
sound
delighted
about
it
that
in
itself
seem
as
admirable
to
me
as
any
of
his
financial
wizardry
family
be
also
in
the
forefront
of
my
weekend
which
be
a
happy
marathon
our
old
kira
be
graduate
with
honor
from
vassar
in
poughkeepsie
new
york
and
the
twin
zachary
and
juliette
from
st
andrew
s
upper
school
in
austin
it
all
start
on
friday
with
a
dinner
for
zach
and
juliette
at
our
house
with
about
twenty
five
family
member
and
close
friend
their
graduation
ceremony
be
the
next
morning
and
we
go
straight
from
there
to
the
airport
and
flew
to
poughkeepsie
saturday
night
be
kira
s
graduation
dinner
and
then
sunday
be
commencement
three
graduation
in
one
weekend
and
fortunately
we
be
able
to
be
there
for
all
of
them
with
grandparent
too
except
mom
whom
we
all
miss
badly


family
be
also
on
my
mind
when
i
met
with
jack
egan
the
son
of
emc
s
late
cofounder
richard
egan
jack
an
independent
board
member
be
a
key
link
to
its
the
company
s
origin
there
be
no
way
emc
could
be
sell
without
his
support
so
on
june
i
go
to
boston
to
ask
for
it
the
occasion
a
dinner
in
a
hotel
suite
high
above
the
harbor
be
a
well
kept
secret
with
just
four
attendee
jack
harry
you
egon
and
me
jack
want
to
explore
the
merger
without
joe
tucci
s
supervision
or
influence
so
joe
entirely
appropriately
stayed
away
harry
be
there
just
to
represent
emc
management
and
observe
the
proceeding
as
soon
as
we
d
finish
eat
and
make
small
talk
egon
and
i
set
about
assure
jack
that
his
father
s
company
would
be
in
good
hand
we
give
it
all
we
have
and
we
meant
every
word
jack
s
first
question
be
close
to
home
emc
be
the
large
publicly
own
company
in
massachusetts
with
strong
economic
and
cultural
tie
to
boston
what
would
dell
s
commitment
to
boston
and
the
community
be
maybe
because
i
m
a
founder
myself
but
not
just
because
of
that
i
say
i
think
it
s
important
to
cherish
the
history
and
legacy
of
how
company
be
start
mistake
and
all
i
told
jack
we
would
always
remember
respect
and
honor
those
who
have
start
emc
and
vmware
and
how
they
d
do
it
i
told
him
that
all
three
company
emc
and
vmware
and
dell
have
strong
commitment
to
involvement
in
our
respective
community
and
speak
for
us
that
philosophy
would
happily
include
boston
after
we
merge
for
starter
i
say
smile
as
i
thought
of
jimmy
i
would
buy
an
apartment
in
boston
and
spend
time
in
the
city
when
i
be
work
at
emc
s
headquarters
in
hopkinton
just
twenty
mile
down
the
mass
pike
jack
nod
then
ask
me
about
our
strategy
and
plan
for
the
combine
company
i
told
jack
that
emc
and
dell
would
be
a
dream
combination
the
world
s
large
privately
control
tech
company
with
the
best
industry
technology
product
and
technical
talent
and
an
awesome
sale
force
the
merger
would
be
a
great
deal
for
emc
shareholder
and
dell
customer
and
partner
a
win
win
we
knew
well
from
our
go
private
i
say
that
a
private
structure
for
the
combine
company
would
create
freedom
for
investment
in
sale
and
innovation
a
long
term
focus
unconstrained
by
quarterly
result
and
the
freedom
to
invest
be
just
the
begin
the
capital
structure
create
by
the
merger
would
be
a
force
multiplier
for
investment
capacity
the
explosive
growth
of
data
head
toward
a
trillion
connect
device
worldwide
demand
nothing
less
customer
be
see
their
need
for
storage
and
security
skyrocket
daily
they
need
to
be
able
to
turn
to
one
company
that
could
address
a
broad
spectrum
of
solution
and
customer
of
course
be
always
look
for
a
trust
partner
the
groundwork
be
already
there
emc
be
know
and
love
by
many
large
enterprise
customer
dell
by
million
of
medium
size
and
small
company
the
two
of
us
combine
would
present
an
even
strong
trust
partner
to
customer
of
all
size
a
partner
lead
in
the
tech
of
today

center
converge
and
hyper
converge
infrastructure
hybrid
cloud
mobility
and
security
both
company
i
say
have
proven
innovation
engine
together
we
would
have
more
scale
a
well
supply
chain
and
most
important
more
commercial
customer
give
emc
dell
a
great
go
to
market
reach
than
any
other
tech
company
in
the
world
in
summary
i
told
jack
dell
plus
emc
would
be
the
essential
it
infrastructure
powerhouse
in
a
unique
position
to
advise
customer
on
how
best
to
transform
their
it
amid
the
data
explosion
no
other
company
i
say
would
come
close
by
the
end
of
the
even
jack
nod
and
we
understood
that
he
d
give
us
his
blessing
now
all
we
have
to
do
be
persuade
the
rest
of
his
board
oh
and
raise
that
last
billion


we
be
almost
there
but
it
be
a
big
almost
even
though
we
dell
be
ready
to
contribute
all
the
equity
of
the
exist
business
essentially
double
or
triple
down
on
the
successful
go
private
plus
nearly
billion
of
new
capital
billion
from
me
personally
and
msd
capital
billion
from
silver
lake
and
million
from
temasek
jimmy
lee
thought
bank
would
feel
this
total
equity
wasn
t
enough
to
support
the
debt
that
would
be
need
to
complete
the
acquisition
we
therefore
begin
to
explore
use
mezzanine
debt
a
hybrid
of
debt
and
equity
financing
which
if
the
deal
go
south
would
potentially
allow
the
lender
to
convert
the
debt
to
equity
because
of
this
conversion
feature
this
kind
of
debt
be
treat
like
equity
it
s
also
expensive
come
with
a
significantly
high
interest
rate
than
the
other
debt
we
d
be
take
on
we
thought
we
might
need
as
much
as
billion
of
mezzanine
debt
we
quickly
conclude
that
temasek
the
singapore
sovereign
wealth
fund
be
our
best
and
possibly
only
viable
partner
still
it
be
scary
to
have
to
put
all
our
egg
in
one
basket
at
one
point
that
summer
it
seem
that
if
temasek
didn
t
want
to
invest
billion
the
deal
wouldn
t
go
forward
over
the
next
week
while
we
negotiate
potential
term
with
temasek
we
continued
to
refine
and
optimize
our
capital
structure
in
an
effort
to
reduce
the
amount
of
new
capital
require
increase
the
amount
of
new
debt
capital
available
minimize
the
cost
of
debt
capital
and
maximize
dell
s
direct
ownership
of
vmware
nine
day
after
my
dinner
with
jack
it
be
june
a
wednesday
afternoon
i
be
look
at
my
bloomberg
terminal
when
a
news
story
flash
on
my
screen
that
make
my
hair
stand
on
end
jimmy
lee
have
die
it
say
i
later
found
out
that
jimmy
have
collapse
while
exercise
at
his
house
in
connecticut
he
be
quickly
take
to
the
hospital
but
couldn
t
be
revive
he
be
sixty
two
way
too
young
it
be
a
devastate
blow
to
all
of
us
and
there
be
many
who
have
love
jimmy
it
also
happen
smack
in
the
middle
of
this
enormous
deal
whose
financing
jimmy
have
be
captain
for
us
at
moment
like
these
it
be
similar
when
my
mom
die
my
compartmentalize
skill
be
test
to
the
limit
my
mind
be
split
between
grief
for
jimmy
s
family
and
friend
thought
about
the
brevity
of
life
and
the
very
press
business
at
hand
literally
ten
of
thousand
of
people
be
go
to
be
affected
by
this
deal
how
could
we
do
right
by
them
and
who
could
possibly
take
jimmy
lee
s
place
jimmy
have
be
a
force
of
nature
everybody
knew
that
he
have
be
the
rocket
booster
under
this
merger
and
jimmy
s
junior
assistant
or
whoever
might
be
tapped
to
take
his
place
weren
t
jimmy
i
fret
about
all
this
for
a
day
or
so
then
my
phone
rang
it
be
jamie
dimon
jimmy
s
bos
and
the
ceo
of
jpmorgan
chase
i
d
know
jamie
for
a
long
time
and
have
the
high
respect
for
him
as
a
leader
and
what
he
be
say
now
that
he
be
go
to
pick
up
for
jimmy
and
shepherd
this
deal
through
to
its
successful
completion
make
me
respect
him
even
more


as
we
progress
the
analysis
go
deeper
each
company
retain
a
consult
firm
to
help
examine
the
revenue
and
cost
synergy
for
project
emerald
bain
for
dell
and
mckinsey
for
emc
and
in
late
august
we
set
a
meeting
at
an
out
of
the
way
hotel
chosen
for
secrecy
s
sake
a
hyatt
regency
in
the
wild
of
northern
new
jersey
for
us
and
emc
plus
a
bunch
of
banker
and
lawyer
to
review
the
consultant
finding
the
night
before
joe
tucci
bill
green
harry
you
egon
and
i
have
dinner
together
at
a
nearby
restaurant
in
a
refurbish
old
railroad
car
serious
business
be
come
the
next
day
but
that
night
the
atmosphere
around
our
table
be
friendly
and
fun
maybe
that
s
what
allow
the
idea
to
surface
i
remember
we
be
all
laugh
about
one
thing
and
another
include
the
idea
of
walk
into
a
bank
sit
down
with
some
loan
officer
and
say
i
want
to
borrow
billion
which
be
pretty
much
where
we
stood
at
that
point
and
it
seem
kind
of
hilarious
but
suddenly
egon
look
serious
for
a
moment
and
raise
his
index
finger
so
the
bank
say
okay
how
be
you
go
to
pay
us
back
he
say
and
we
say
well
actually
we
have
a
couple
of
way
to
pay
you
back
we
all
quiet
down
and
listen
one
be
we
have
this
thing
call
our
isg
business
which
be
the
combination
of
emc
s
storage
which
have
be
around
for
thirty
plus
year
and
dell
s
server
business
which
be
world
lead
and
then
we
have
this
thing
call
the
pc
business
which
generates
all
this
cash
flow
then
he
say
we
have
this
other
thing
call
vmware
even
though
we
re
issue
a
track
stock
we
have
eighty
one
percent
of
the
actual
common
stock
of
vmware
on
our
balance
sheet
it
trade
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
that
vmware
stock
be
worth
around
billion
but
because
after
the
merger
we
would
have
that
eighty
one
percent
of
vmware
on
our
balance
sheet
our
equity
in
the
company
would
be
far
great
than
it
would
be
without
vmware
include
so
mr
or
m
banker
we
actually
have
multiple
way
to
pay
you
back
egon
smile
and
this
be
the
beautiful
part
we
really
don
t
need
that
expensive
mezzanine
debt
with
temasek
be
i
misremember
or
do
joe
bill
harry
and
i
all
really
break
into
spontaneous
applause
what
i
know
for
sure
be
that
now
all
of
us
be
smile


we
approach
the
rating
agency
advisory
service
to
discus
our
propose
financing
and
to
seek
tentative
rating
for
our
financing
and
capital
structure
our
final
structure
now
include
the
rollover
of
some
of
emc
s
exist
investment
grade
debt
but
most
important
by
make
egon
s
bulletproof
argument
about
vmware
we
be
able
to
achieve
investment
grade
tranche
rating
for
the
majority
of
the
new
debt
we
have
to
raise
this
be
a
breakthrough
the
investment
grade
debt
market
be
much
deeper
be
able
to
tap
it
enable
us
to
increase
the
amount
and
low
the
cost
of
available
new
debt
capital
to
a
point
where
we
no
longer
need
to
raise
any
expensive
prefer
stock
from
temasek
to
fund
the
transaction
now
we
could
see
a
path
to
victory
with
one
more
major
hurdle
on
wednesday
morning
september
egon
and
i
go
to
the
time
square
legal
office
of
skadden
arp
for
what
be
arguably
the
big
meeting
of
my
professional
life
it
be
put
up
or
shut
up
time
the
day
that
the
emc
board
be
go
to
take
a
beady
eyed
look
at
me
and
my
company
and
decide
if
we
be
worthy
to
buy
their
company
and
no
pressure
whether
i
be
worthy
to
lead
the
whole
shebang
it
ease
my
nerve
considerably
that
we
have
a
friend
with
us
jamie
dimon
a
big
meeting
room
fill
with
emc
board
member
and
management
and
banker
and
lawyer
a
video
camera
and
speakerphone
to
include
all
who
couldn
t
be
present
a
couple
dozen
people
wait
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i
d
thought
of
the
occasion
as
a
job
interview
i
felt
confident
but
at
the
same
time
well
aware
that
there
be
a
huge
amount
at
stake
the
board
have
a
lot
of
question
they
want
to
understand
our
plan
and
also
see
how
thing
would
change
they
want
to
know
how
we
would
keep
the
vmware
ecosystem
independent
they
want
to
know
how
we
would
continue
the
philanthropic
and
community
involvement
that
emc
have
at
the
core
of
its
culture
i
make
my
best
pitch
i
explain
how
we
could
operate
more
effectively
as
a
private
company
with
a
long
term
focus
i
mention
the
opinion
piece
i
d
write
for
the
wall
street
journal
a
few
month
back
in
which
i
explain
how
go
private
be
pay
off
for
us
in
the
piece
i
say
that
privatization
have
unleashed
the
passion
of
our
team
member
who
now
have
the
freedom
to
focus
first
on
innovate
for
customer
in
way
that
weren
t
always
possible
when
strive
to
meet
the
quarterly
demand
of
wall
street
recall
the
trial
that
southeastern
management
have
put
us
through
and
mention
the
similar
trial
elliott
management
be
still
put
emc
through
i
remind
the
board
that
privatization
also
freed
a
company
from
the
pressure
of
activist
investor
i
explain
our
plan
for
team
member
retention
and
growth
i
say
that
we
plan
to
retain
the
vast
majority
of
the
senior
executive
because
our
combination
be
mostly
about
growth
and
revenue
synergy
and
i
remind
the
board
that
hp
would
have
eliminate
many
position
the
vast
majority
of
the
very
talented
people
at
emc
and
vmware
and
pivotal
i
told
the
board
be
complementary
with
our
team
i
affirm
my
and
our
commitment
to
boston
and
massachusetts
i
told
them
as
i
d
told
jack
that
i
plan
to
get

for
what

his
team
have
create
as
well
as
how
they
create
it
and
that
we
only
plan
to
extend
it
not
alter
it
an
hour
or
so
into
the
meeting
there
be
a
momentary
silence
then
one
of
the
board
member
broke
it
with
a
question
this
merger
would
add
a
lot
to
your
job
and
your
job
be
already

he
say
we
re
all

of
wonder
how
devote
to
it

re
go
to
be
able
to
be
look
this
business
have
my
name
on
it

say
then
i
smile
but
also
those
of
you
with
kid
will
understand
my
twin
be
grown
up
they
re
both

i
have
a
lot
of
free
time
on
my
hand
this
get
a
laugh
but
once
the
room
quiet
down
another
director
give
me
a
serious
look
do
you
have
the
money
he
ask
we
re
talk
about
a
lot
of
money
before
i
could
say
a
word
jamie
spoke
up
yes
he
say
they
have
the
money
the
laughter
be
even
louder
this
time
then
another
silence
as
the
stature
and
credibility
of
the
man
who
d
spoken
sank
in
it
be
a
moment
i
will
never
forget
and
something
for
which
i
ll
always
be
grateful
to
jamie


after
the
meeting
i
call
each
of
the
top
emc
and
vmware
executive
and
ask
for
their
commitment

new

of
them

in
and
it
be
start
to
get
very
real

to
austin
and
then
on
saturday

fifth

a
weeklong
business

to
visit
some
of
our
location

along
with
me

time

proceed
to
shanghai
then
tokyo
then
dad
go
back
to
houston
and
i
met
susan
that
weekend
at
a
small
resort
in
the
wilderness
and
isolation
of
southern
utah
where
we
love
to
go
hike
maybe
it
be
also
the
jet
lag
but
with
the
announcement
of
the
large
technology
acquisition
ever
now
about
a
month
away
and
approach
fast
i
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
my
heart
race
and
my
mind
swarm
with
a
blizzard
of
thought
about
thing
i
need
to
do
and
question
about
how
i
be
go
to
get
it
all
do
the
truth
be
that
deep
down
i
wasn
t
sure
how
the
whole
thing
would
work
there
be
so
many
detail
to
be
iron
out
detail
that
only
a
few
people
knew
about
so
i
couldn
t
involve
the
broader
team
in
address
all
of
them
i
be
not
prone
to
panic
but
i
d
never
experienced
anything
quite
like
it
this
might
have
be
my
version
of
a
panic
attack
i
write
down
a
bunch
of
thought
star
at
the
star
for
a
while
and
finally
be
able
to
go
back
to
sleep


on
the
morning
of
monday
october
we
make
the
big
announcement
in
a
deal
twice
as
large
as
the
previously
large
tech
only
deal
hp
s
billion
acquisition
of
compaq
in
dell
inc
and
emc

become
one
company
with
over
team
member
to
be
call
dell
technology
and
to
be
lead
by
me
we
have
actually
brought
it
off
actually
purchase
a
billion
company
with
billion
in
equity
plus
all
the
equity
in
dell
inc
our
debt
financing
have
succeed
beyond
our
dream
it
be
as
though
we
d
ridden
a
motorcycle
over
a
tightrope
across
niagara
fall
the
blowback
begin
immediately
our
competitor
be
say
oh
it
s
go
to
take
them
year
to
sort
it
out
it
s
not
go
to
work
they
ll
have
all
kind
of
problem
you
should
buy
from
us
instead
meg
whitman
lead
the
charge
as
she
have
before
with
our
go
private
in
an
email
sent
to
all
hewlett
packard
enterprise
employee
she
call
the
merger
a
good
thing
for
hewlett
packard
enterprise
and
an
opportunity
for
us
to
seize
the
moment
a
good
thing
for
hp
but
a
bad
thing
for
dell
meg
claimed
to
pay
back
the
interest
on
the
billion
of
debt
that
the
new
combine
company
will
have
on
their
balance
sheet
dell
will
need
to
pay
roughly
billion
a
year
in
interest
alone
that
s
billion
that
they
will
allocate
away
from
r
d
and
other
business
critical
activity
which
will
keep
them
from
well
serve
their
customer
meg
seem
to
know
an
awful
lot
about
how
we
allocate
capital
in
truth
our
creative
and
efficient
capital
structure
set
the
stage
for
strong
cash
flow
and
accelerate
debt
paydown
but
our
supposedly
excessive
debt
load
be
far
from
her
only
critique
there
be
also
the
problematic
combine
of
our
two
company
integrate
emc
and
dell
which
combine
have
more
than
billion
in
revenue
and
nearly
employee
be
no
small
feat
this
will
be
a
massive
undertaking
and
an
enormous
distraction
for
employee
and
their
management
team
as
two
very
different
culture
come
together
leadership
team
shift
and
an
entirely
new
strategy
be
developed
nor
be
that
all
bring
two
portfolio
together
meg
claimed
will
require
a
significant
amount
of
product
rationalization
which
will
be
disruptive
to
their
business
and
create
confusion
for
their
customer
customer
simply
will
not
know
if
the
product
they
be
buying
today
from
either
company
will
be
support
in
eighteen
month
be
the
pot
call
the
kettle
black
as
one
commentator
write
if
anyone
would
know
about
that
kind
of
mess
it
would
be
hp
that
huge
acquisition
of
compaq
admittedly
well
before
meg
s
tenure
have
never
amount
to
much
except
the
dismantle
of
a
formerly
important
company
and
a
boost
to
our
position
in
the
pc
market
and
then
there
be
hp
s
purchase
of
the
software
company
autonomy
a
company
we
d
briefly
consider
acquire
but
pass
on
because
at
billion
it
seem
outrageously
overprice
apparently
hp
s
board
felt
the
same
way
because
they
fire
leo
apotheker
for
say
he
plan
to
buy
it
then
one
month
after
take
over
from
apotheker
meg
whitman
go
ahead
and
acquire
autonomy
anyway
at
the
previously
agree
price
and
then
the
whole
thing
turn
into
an
embarrass
fiasco
for
hewlett
packard
and
an
billion
write
off
when
it
be
discover
that
autonomy
have
be
cooking
its
book
i
do
like
and
respect
meg
but
what
she
be
engage
in
now
be
nothing
but
sow
fud
in
a
somewhat
desperate
effort
to
make
up
for
the
other
colossal
blunder
she
d
commit
drop
hp
s
acquisition
of
emc
not
vitriolic
carl
icahn
level
fud
but
fud
just
the
same
in
her
defense
this
be
something
many
ceo
do
from
time
to
time
i
might
have
do
it
a
time
or
two
myself
she
be
just
try
to
spin
the
medium
and
rally
her
troop
but
the
moment
she
split
her
company
in
two
be
the
moment
she
admit
that
in
effect
she
have
cede
victory
in
the
it
infrastructure
business
to
us


we
announce
the
merger
that
october
yet
due
to
a
long
drawn
out
approval
process
all
the
major
government
where
both
company
do
business
have
to
declare
that
the
combination
violate
no
antitrust
regulation
it
wouldn
t
actually
become
effective
until
eleven
month
later
september
a
story
by
august
every
single
country
in
the
world
where
we
need
to
get
approval
for
the
merger
over
twenty
have
give
their
blessing
except
one
china
the
people
s
republic
have
not
give
its
ok
within
the
mandate
day
approval
period
and
so
have
open
another
day
period
in
which
to
do
far
analysis
another
six
month
of
delay
would
be
damage
to
our
business
and
our
team
so
i
instruct
rich
rothberg
our
general
counsel
at
the
time
to
go
to
beijing
report
back
to
me
every
week
and
do
everything
he
could
to
make
sure
mofcom
the
chinese
antitrust
authority
have
all
the
information
it
need
to
come
to
a
quick
decision
after
one
week
rich
call
and
told
me
that
he
wasn
t
hearing
anything
about
when
the
authority
would
decide
the
same
thing
after
week
two
when
he
call
with
the
same
news
again
in
week
three
i
told
him
that
we
need
to
put
a
stake
in
the
ground
and
tell
mofcom
that
he
wasn
t
go
to
leave
china
until
they
provide
approval
no
matter
how
long
it
take
rich
met
my
directive
with
about
second
of
silence
while
he
no
doubt
contemplate
spending
the
next
several
month
in
beijing
and
enjoy
thanksgiving
the
christmas
holiday
and
new
year
s
with
our
dell
china
team
member
he
reply
that
he
didn
t
think
mofcom
or
the
government
of
china
would
care
about
or
be
influence
by
his
whereabouts
while
they
take
their
time
decide
our
fate
undeterred
by
rich
s
lack
of
faith
in
the
power
of
one
individual
to
make
a
difference
i
respond
that
i
also
thought
it
would
be
meaningful
to
our
management
team
and
a
sign
of
how
important
this
be
to
the
company
for
him
to
announce
to
our
team
his
decision
to
stay
in
china
until
approval
be
receive
another
second
of
silence
after
which
rich
say
he
felt
confident
that
what
he
be
do
in
china
largely
wait
in
a
conference
room
in
our
dell
office
could
be
do
just
as
effectively
in
austin
this
time
i
be
silent
and
after
about
more
second
during
which
time
i
m
sure
rich
thought
about
the
wisdom
of
his
bos
s
suggestion
he
piped
up
that
in
fact
he
do
think
his
remain
in
beijing
make
sense
and
would
be
a
strong
signal
to
the
chinese
government
that
we
would
do
whatever
it
take
to
get
a
timely
decision
i
m
not
sure
if
that
decision
be
a
factor
or
not
but
luckily
for
rich
and
for
the
company
mofcom
give
its
approval
within
the
next
ten
day
and
rich
be
home
in
early
september
in
plenty
of
time
for
the
holiday
throughout
the
approval
process
we
knew
our
competitor
be
go
to
try
to
throw
sand
in
the
gear
we
knew
they
would
go
to
the
department
of
justice
s
antitrust
division
and
say
you
know
dell
be
go
to
buy
vmware
and
they
re
go
to
take
away
vmware
access
for
all
its
competitor
so
you
need
to
investigate
that
so
one
of
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
be
personally
call
the
ceo
of
all
our
competitor
the
head
of
cisco
ibm
netapp
lenovo
and
many
others
and
yes
meg
whitman
and
assure
them
that
vmware
be
go
to
remain
independent
then
i
really
have
my
work
cut
out
for
me
to
put
it
in
a
more
positive
way
the
lengthy
approval
process
give
us
more
time
to
begin
work
on
the
very
big
and
very
important
job
of
meld
dell
and
emc
because
in
truth
meg
s
second
point
that
integrate
two
gigantic
company
each
with
its
own
distinctive
corporate
culture
be
a
bear
wasn
t
far
off
the
mark
but
she
d
cast
the
challenge
in
the
most
negative
light
possible
whereas
i
saw
it
as
a
tremendous
opportunity
and
before
anything
else
a
branding
opportunity
one
of
the
big
question
early
on
be
what
would
we
call
the
new
company
it
be
not
a
question
that
could
be
answer
easily
or
intuitively
so
we
apply
a
proven
dell
process
that
resolve
any
decision
no
matter
how
complex
in
thirty
to
forty
day
the
process
consists
of
two
step
fact
and
alternative
and
choice
and
commitment
company
often
get
hung
up
on
big
complicate
decision
which
either
never
get
decide
or
take
four
or
five
or
ten
month
to
work
out
our
way
say
let
s
get
the
real
fact
here
not
opinion
fact
at
the
same
time
we
ask
what
be
all
the
legitimate
alternative
not
crazy
thing
that
you
would
never
do
but
the
actual
legitimate
alternative
then
you
spend
not
much
time
a
couple
of
week
look
carefully
at
each
of
these
alternative
then
come
choice
and
commitment
which
no
surprise
say
okay
we
re
go
to
make
a
choice
and
commit
to
it
the
selection
isn
t
base
on
personality
or
emotion
it
s
a
very
fact
and
data
orient
objective
process
we
have
a
truth
seek
culture
have
learn
long
ago
that
fact
and
data
be
your
friend
with
this
branding
the
first
question
be
what
be
the
alternative
well
you
could
just
call
the
company
dell
you
could
call
it
emc
you
could
call
it
dellemc
you
could
call
it
dell
emc
vmware
we
have
a
few
others
dell
lab
or
dell
laboratory
one
of
the
alternative
be
to
create
a
completely
new
brand
but
we
conclude
that
that
would
cost
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
and
take
a
long
time
whereas
we
already
have
one
of
the
most
recognize
brand
mark
in
the
world
in
dell
emc
wasn
t
quite
as
well
know
across
the
industry
but
to
a
particular
kind
of
customer
it
be
prominent
and
highly
value
all
these
company
with
the
big
building
with
their
logo
on
them
they
knew
what
be
in
their
data
center
so
for
the
infrastructure
business
we
create
dellemc
as
the
brand
and
then
as
the
parent
company
brand
dell
technology
but
even
more
important
than
name
the
new
company
be
form
a
completely
integrate
and
smoothly
function
team
toward
that
end
i
spent
the
rest
of
and
the
first
three
quarter
of
go
on
a
major
charm
offensive
do
everything
i
could
to
make
as
many
level
as
possible
of
emc
management
not
just
comfortable
about
the
combination
but
excite
about
it
one
of
the
first
challenge
be
to
avoid
really
to
stamp
out
any
characterization
of
the
merger
as
an
acquisition
i
always
like
to
look
at
these
thing
through
the
lens
of
the
customer
and
the
team
member
also
know
as
the
employee
if
you
re
a
customer
you
don
t
want
to
hear
about
acquisition
carl
icahn
make
acquisition
these
be
the
kind
of
takeover
in
which
entire
board
and
executive
team
get
strip
out
in
the
interest
of
flip
a
company
for
a
quick
profit
a
combination
sound
a
lot
well
than
an
acquisition
a
merger
kind
of
sound
like
a
combination
you
can
say
merger
still
if
you
re
a
team
member
maybe
especially
if
you
re
a
team
member
there
s
something
very
odd
about
be
in
a
merger
when
you
join
a
company
you
ve
make
an
affirmative
decision
to
join
that
company
and
it
have
make
an
affirmative
decision
to
have
you
join
in
an
acquisition
or
merger
that
s
not
the
case
your
company
be
bought
or
combine
with
another
company
and
now
you
work
for
this
new
company
you
didn
t
make
a
positive
decision
to
work
for
this
new
organization
and
they
didn
t
make
a
positive
decision
to
hire
you
either
it
s
a
totally
different
relationship
one
that
s
tricky
to
make
people
feel
good
about
what
if
the
shoe
have
be
on
the
other
foot
i
spent
time
think
about
that
we
re
sit
there
in
round
rock
texas
do
our
thing
then
some
company
buy
our
company
well
first
of
all
the
new
headquarters
wouldn
t
be
in
round
rock
texas
anymore
it
d
be
in
some
other
place
and
maybe
i
would
be
there
maybe
i
wouldn
t
be
there
maybe
there
d
be
a
whole
other
set
of
people
there
it
d
be
different
for
sure
and
so
i
go
out
of
my
way
during
that
year
to
give
as
many
of
emc
s
people
as
possible
the
big
hug
imaginable
of
course
they
have
financial
incentive
to
stay
but
that
isn
t
as
powerful
as
the
emotional
connection
the
feel
of
okay
i
know
the
folk
who
be
involve
in
lead
this
company
and
i
trust
them
and
i
believe
in
what
we
re
do
and
what
we
be
do
be
important
i
do
all
kind
of
thing
i
take
people
to
dinner
i
invite
people
to
my
house
i
want
to
build
relationship
and
understand
their
perspective
and
insight
from
our
previous
alliance
i
knew
some
of
emc
s
executive
like
bill
scannell
who
d
start
at
the
company
back
in
and
howard
elia
and
i
have
gotten
to
know
many
more
during
the
past
year
it
be
an
awesome
very
talented
leadership
team
i
go
on
linkedin
and
connect
with
everybody
who
have
a
reasonably
important
title
at
emc
and
vmware
and
pivotal
nobody
expect
that
you
have
a
linkedin
request
from
michael
dell
not
to
puff
up
my
personal
importance
but
people
be
excite
to
hear
directly
from
the
ceo
whoever
he
or
she
be
when
someone
would
write
me
back
i
d
say
welcome
to
the
team
we
re
so
excite
heard
great
thing
about
you
assume
i
have
and
can
t
wait
to
work
with
you
i
also
go
around
to
as
many
of
emc
s
office
as
i
possibly
could
always
send
the
word
ahead
of
time
i
want
to
meet
one
on
one
with
as
many
of
the
top
people
as
i
can
i
wasn
t
disingenuous
about
it
i
wouldn
t
tell
somebody
i
d
heard
they
be
great
if
i
hadn
t
heard
they
be
great
but
my
campaign
be
purposeful
i
recognize
that
these
people
hadn
t
affirmatively
decide
to
work
for
our
company
maybe
they
didn
t
know
anything
about
our
company
except
what
they
d
heard
so
it
be
almost
as
if
i
be
rehiring
every
one
of
them
i
be
go
more
than
halfway
across
the
table
to
say
hey
i
ve
heard
terrific
thing
about
you
and
i
really
want
you
on
the
team
i
want
to
assure
you
that
you
ve
get
an
important
role
in
the
company
a
big
part
of
why
we
re
combine
be
the
work
you
re
do
and
this
new
product
be
really
great
i
want
to
learn
more
about
this
and
keep
me
post
on
that
and
feel
free
to
contact
me
at
any
time
and
let
me
know
how
i
can
be
helpful
i
also
want
to
hear
their
idea
about
the
best
opportunity
ahead
of
us
my
note
with
everyone
i
met
be
we
re
in
this
together
but
my
campaign
be
also
target
we
d
know
since
the
begin
that
the
merger
would
create
some
redundancy
we
didn
t
want
everybody
to
stay
in
some
case
there
be
overlap
function
and
some
hard
decision
have
to
be
make
this
wasn
t
the
key
plot
of
the
combination
but
it
need
to
be
do
how
do
you
decide
who
stay
and
who
go
we
start
with
strategy
structure
people
what
s
the
strategy
what
s
the
best
structure
to
execute
it
and
then
who
best
fit
the
structure
to
execute
the
strategy
as
we
look
at
the
people
in
both
organization
we
found
an
incredibly
deep
bench
of
talent
for
almost
every
position
we
have
three
or
four
in
some
case
five
qualify
candidate
it
s
inevitable
that
when
you
put
together
two
giant
company
there
be
go
to
be
more
great
people
than
there
be
great
job
on
the
one
hand
this
give
us
the
opportunity
to
really
increase
the
caliber
of
the
talent
across
the
organization
on
the
other
it
make
for
some
tough
moment
there
be
one
top
function
i
won
t
say
which
that
be
occupy
in
dell
and
emc
respectively
by
two
extremely
skillful
and
engage
guy
dell
s
guy
have
just
be
appoint
emc
s
guy
have
be
there
a
long
time
either
one
could
ve
do
an
outstanding
job
go
forward
but
the
hard
truth
be
that
the
dell
guy
be
newly
appoint
be
in
a
position
to
grow
up
in
a
role
where
all
he
knew
be
the
combine
organization
and
thus
could
give
the
merge
company
a
perspective
that
wasn
t
steep
in
one
legacy
company
or
another
i
told
the
emc
guy
right
off
that
there
wasn
t
go
to
be
a
job
for
him
i
thanked
him
for
all
the
great
work
he
d
do
and
say
i
knew
he
be
go
to
continue
to
help
through
the
completion
of
the
combination
i
told
him
we
d
have
a
generous
severance
package
for
him
he
say
well
i
ll
go
think
about
it
he
come
back
and
propose
a
plan
wherein
the
other
guy
would
continue
to
perform
the
function
for
dellemc
and
he
himself
would
perform
it
for
dell
technology
make
him
the
parent
company
s
top
guy
in
that
position
the
uber
guy
if
you
will
well
i
say
that
s
not
really
what
i
have
in
mind
it
take
me
a
couple
of
meeting
to
convince
him
that
there
actually
wasn
t
a
job
for
him
anymore
he
really
be
a
very
nice
guy
and
the
decision
be
hard
on
us
both
harder
on
him
of
course
he
be
disappointed
in
the
outcome
but
not
in
his
severance
out
of
this
sometimes
bumpy
process
we
emerge
with
a
great
team
consist
of
the
best
people
across
the
whole
company
we
be
and
still
be
very
thoughtful
about
the
balance
of
the
team
so
that
it
truly
reflect
our
collective
strength
as
a
company
five
year
in
there
s
so
much
cross
pollination
that
almost
no
one
say
anymore
i
m
legacy
dell
or
i
m
legacy
emc
if
they
do
we
remind
them
gently
no
no
it
s
all
one
company
now
we
re
dell
technology


i
be
perfectly
happy
stay
private
or
to
be
more
accurate
remain
due
to
the
track
stock
a
public
company
that
be
privately
control
the
merger
have
work
and
it
kept
work
just
as
we
d
anticipate
the
two
company
together
be
great
than
the
sum
of
our
part
combine
the
server
business
of
dell
and
the
storage
business
of
emc
have
create
a
giant
new
infrastructure
business
that
be
super
successful
when
we
combine
with
emc
our
sale
be
close
to
billion
through
and
we
add
almost
billion
in
new
revenue

more

also
retook
the

if
the

it
be
a
pretty
lively
corpse
and
the
percent
interest
in
vmware
that
come
along
with
the
deal

a
bonanza

over
the
twelve

good
deal
of

we
d
take
on
to
complete
the

it
be
time
to
simplify
our
capital
structure
increase
our
economic
interest
in

and
align
the
interest
of

form
an
independent
special
committee
shade
of
to
explore
all
the
alternative
should
we
just
buy
all
of
vmware
vmware
didn
t
really
like
that
idea
they
be
rightly
proud
of
their
identity
as
an
independent
software
company
and
have
no
desire
to
lose
that
independence
ultimately
the
best
path
forward
and
here
we
have
the
wise
counsel
of
gregg
lemkau
head
of
investment
banking
at
goldman
sachs
seem
to
lie
in
acquire
the
track
stock
for
cash
and
common
stock
of
the
parent
company
buying
the
tracker
could
be
a
great
simplify
move
but
in
order
to
compensate
dvmt
shareholder
correctly
the
committee
have
to
establish
a
value
for
dell
technology
and
ultimately
there
would
need
to
be
a
vote
from
the
holder
of
the
track
share
in
favor
of
the
transaction
the
financial
press
chronicle
our
step
forward
with
some
interest
you
don
t
just
let
go
of
the
story
of
the
big
tech
merger
ever
and
then
the
attention
quickly
attract
the
attention
of
another
very
interested
party
the
guy
i
d
once
thought
of
as
the
joker


on
july
we
silver
lake
and
dell
technology
announce
our
plan
to
acquire
the
track
stock
the
financial
press
call
it
overcomplicated
but
it
seem
simple
enough
to
us
we
be
propose
to
buy
out
owner
of
the
class
v
share
with
their
choice
of
cash
or
class
c
common
stock
in
dell
technology
after
the
transaction
the
class
c
common
stock
would
trade
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
meant
that
dell
would
once
more
become
a
public
company
under
the
plan
track
stock
owner
would
receive
either
in
cash
or
share
of
dell
class
c
stock
for
each
share
of
dvmt
they
held
the
track
stock
have
close
at
in
the
last
trading
session
before
the
announcement
so
those
who
chose
cash
would
get
a
percent
premium
for
their
stock
more
than
double
what
the
tracker
be
worth
when
first
issue
the
value
of
the
buyout
for
those
who
chose
class
c
stock
would
depend
on
the
share
price
once
it
begin
trading
a
gamble
sure
but
a
very
good
bet
and
an
alternative
that
would
be
at
the
discretion
of
each
shareholder
who
want
to
take
that
bet
and
of
course
that
didn
t
stop
carl
icahn
from
make
trouble
anyway
lose
his
battle
to
take
over
dell
might
ve
ding
carl
but
it
didn
t
discourage
him
in
any
major
sense
he
be
like
a
zombie
that
you
couldn
t
kill
he
just
kept
on
keep
on
do
what
he
be
famous
for
buying
up
big
position
in
company
where
he
smell
blood
in
the
water
and
try
to
extract
value
from
those
company
whether
it
be
good
for
them
or
not
win
a
battle
here
lose
one
there
savor
the
game
and
all
the
publicity
it
brought
him
generally
come
out
ahead
and
add
to
his
large
fortune
for
all
the
joy
it
brought
him
which
didn
t
seem
to
be
much
be
go
up
against
us
again
icahn
s
attempt
at
redemption
as
i
always
say
i
don
t
like
to
engage
in
speculation
especially
where
other
people
s
motif
be
concerned
more
likely
be
that
the
poker
player
in
carl
simply
saw
another
chance
for
action
his
first
move
in
be
straight
out
of
his
well
worn
playbook
and
an
echo
of
his
first
move
in
once
again
he
begin
buying
up
a
bunch
of
our
share
start
out
modestly
and
quietly
in
the
spring
but
by
the
time
he
disclose
his
position
in
mid
august
have
accumulate
a
percent
interest
in
dvmt
by
october
he
d
become
the
tracker
s
number
one
stockholder
at
percent
once
again
he
intend
to
make
trouble
in
a
major
kind
of
way
as
before
he
pretend
to
be
the
voice
of
the
poor
downtrodden
stockholder
whom
we
be
try
to
shaft
he
charge
with
an
insultingly
low
offer
in
a
highly
colorful
october
regulatory
filing
icahn
knew
no
other
style
with
the
sec
an
angry
ramble
letter
that
stood
reason
on
its
head
and
call
the
glass
not
just
half
empty
but
barely
wet
carl
accuse
silver
lake
and
me
of
have
concoct
the
emc
merger
out
of
a
sense
of
dell
inc
s
gross
inadequacy
several
year
ago
i
believe
dell
and
silver
lake
realize
that
dell
technology
sic
be
simply
a
highly
leveraged
hardware
company
face
great
secular
challenge
and
would
never
enjoy
the
growth
and
success
of
apple
and
microsoft
therefore
they
lever
up
dramatically
to
purchase
emc
corporation
a
well
position
hybrid
hardware
and
software
company
whose
crown
jewel
be
its
percent
ownership
interest
in
vmware
inc
in
icahn
s
worldview
silver
lake
and
i
have
collude
nefariously
to
create
the
track
stock
and
fob
it
off
on
emc
shareholder
with
the
intention
of
destroy
its
value
through
scare
tactic
reminiscent
of
the
tactic
machiavelli
advise
the
borgia
ruler
to
use
century
ago
then
buying
it
back
at
bargain
basement
price
in
carl
s
view
dell
technology
didn
t
just
want
to
simplify
capital
structure
and
benefit
appropriately
from
our
success
no
we
desperately
need
to
get
that
track
stock
back
the
combination
of
high
leverage
and
the
cyclicality
of
dell
s
business
mean
that
it
be
possible
that
dell
s
cash
flow
may
be
severely
impaired
by
any
downturn
in
its
business
make
it
very
important
for
them
to
get
control
of
vmware
s
more
stable
recur
cash
flow
to
continue
pay
down
debt
we
believe
that
dell
have
a
more
press
need
for
vmware
s
cash
flow
than
management
would
have
you
believe
at
the
current
price
the
differential
between
the
track
stock
share
and
publicly
trade
vmw
share
the
discount
amount
to
around
billion
by
icahn
s
calculation
our
offer
to
the
dvmt
stockholder
amount
to
try
to
grab
that
billion
off
the
table
make
no
mistake
he
write
if
the
current
opportunistic
deal
succeed
percent
of
the
discount
approximately
billion
will
be
an
economic
windfall
mostly
attributable
to
michael
dell
and
his
silver
lake
partner
it
be
clear
to
me
that
dell
and
silver
lake
have
follow
machiavelli
s
advice
to
the
letter
it
be
well
to
be
respect
than
love
but
well
still
to
be
fear
than
respect
again
with
the
machiavelli
carl
like
to
make
his
sign
offs
extra
zippy
and
this
one
didn
t
disappoint
in
closing
he
write
i
firmly
believe
dell
and
silver
lake
be
try
to
capture
billion
of
value
that
rightly
belongs
to
us
the
dvmt
stockholder
as
such
i
intend
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
stop
this
propose
dvmt
merger
in
my
opinion
it
be
well
to
have
peace
than
war
but
be
assure
i
still
enjoy
a
good
fight
for
the
right
reason
and
in
the
current
situation
i
do
not
see
peace
arrive
quickly
stay
tune
totally
false
of
course
but
naturally
the
financial
press
love
it
they
ran
photoshopped
image
of
icahn
and
me
face
off
with
boxing
glove
and
it
wasn
t
just
dell
versus
icahn
other
major
holder
of
the
track
stock
be
line
up
with
carl
p
schoenfeld
asset
management
psam
blackrock
inc
paul
singer
of
elliott
canyon
partner
mason
capital
this
could
make
good
copy
for
month
and
then
no
doubt
to
the
disappointment
of
onlooker
and
commentator
and
pot
stirrer
everywhere
the
whole
thing
kind
of
petered
out


it
all
last
only
a
month
ultimately
icahn
s
assault
on
us
be
just
a
pallid
echo
of
on
november
he
file
a
lawsuit
against
us
as
carl
be
wont
to
do
allege
that
dell
have
refuse
to
provide
financial
information
to
dvmt
shareholder
regard
our
propose
acquisition
of
the
track
stock
he
charge
us
with
threaten
the
stockholder
with
an
ipo
and
a
force
conversion
of
their
share
into
share
of
our
newly
list
stock
if
we
couldn
t
get
the
vote
for
an
acquisition
do
we
consider
a
dell
technology
ipo
instead
of
a
track
stock
buyout
we
do
and
we
even
discuss
the
possibility
with
several
bank
who
pitch
us
on
the
idea
but
it
be
our
backup
plan
the
far
simpler
option
be
just
to
raise
our
offer
which
be
exactly
what
we
do
on
november
increase
our
bid
to
billion
or
per
share
we
also
agree
to
other
change
include
give
class
c
stockholder
the
right
to
elect
one
independent
director
and
just
like
that
the
track
stock
shareholder
come
around
elliott
canyon
partner
mason
capital
and
others
in
all
holder
of
about
percent
of
the
dvmt
share
all
decide
to
accept
our
offer
leave
icahn
out
in
the
cold
on
november
he
withdrew
his
lawsuit
first
take
credit
for
get
us
to
raise
the
offer
largely
due
to
our
opposition
today
dell
enhance
the
deal
by
reduce
the
value
be
divert
from
dvmt
stockholder
from
over
billion
to
billion
and
then
signing
out
in
characteristically
grumpy
fashion
although
we
believe
a
far
well
deal
could
have
be
obtain
unfortunately
and
as
you
might
imagine
we
be
not
invite
to
the
negotiation
by
either
dell
or
goldman
sachs
our
investment
bank
in
the
deal
in
connection
with
the
revise
deal
it
appear
that
stockholder
represent
percent
of
the
stock
have
decide
to
switch
over
and
support
dell
as
a
result
of
this
as
well
as
the
support
dell
already
have
we
have
determine
that
a
proxy
fight
would
be
unwinnable
and
have
decide
to
withdraw
our
delaware
litigation
and
terminate
our
proxy
contest
and
just
like
that
my
would
be
nemesis
slunk
away
hasta
la
vista
carl
maybe
we
ll
dine
again
someday
and
the
way
be
clear
for
dell
technology
to
become
the
best
possible
version
of
itself
as
tech
ceo
dan
serpico
say
at
the
time
this
be
go
to
take
away
all
the
fud
and
noise
and
allow
dell
and
its
partner
community
to
focus
on
the
thing
that
be
most
important
like
meeting
the
customer
where
the
customer
be
with
great
solution
create
a
good
channel
provide
good
incentive
and
invest
in
future
technology
amen
on
december
at
a
special
meeting
in
round
rock
percent
of

vote
in
favor
of

on
december
it
become
official
we

a
very
different
kind
of

ever
be
before
with
this
vote
i
told

structure
and
align
the
interest
of
our

this
strengthens
our
strategic
position
as
we
continue

and
integrate

from

you
re
in
cyber
you
re
in
networking
give
us
the
elevator
pitch
what
be
dell
s
unique
market
proposition
we
see
ourselves
as
the
essential
infrastructure
company
i
told
him
i
say
that
our
customer
be
face
some
version
of
four
different
transformation
the
digital
transformation
be
the
big
one
the
one
every
company
on
the
planet
be
start
to
deal
with
and
that
i
say
be
directly
connect
to
the
second
transformation
the
explosion
in
the
number
of
intelligent
and
connect
node
and
all
the
data
and
the
internet
of
thing
and
machine
intelligence
and
ai
that
i
told
alan
be
a
big
deal
for
ton
of
company
then
you
have
the
it
transformation
i
say
how
do
you
automate
and
modernize
and
have
a
more
cloudlike
model
that
of
course
necessitates
a
workforce
transformation
how
do
you
enable
all
your
people
to
have
the
right
tool
and
then
finally
how
do
you
secure
alan
look
receptive
but
still
puzzle
combine
with
emc
and
vmware
and
pivotal
i
told
him
allow
us
to
create
this
new
company
dell
technology
which
have
become
the
leader
in
infrastructure
it
i
say
that
we
also
have
a
fantastic
position
in
a
lot
of
the
new
way
the
industry
s
evolve
the
software
define
data
center
and
hyper
converge
infrastructure
where
all
the
it
function
that
once
be
hardware
define
be
virtualized
that
we
be
store
more
mission
critical
data
than
anyone
else
on
the
planet
make
more
server
than
anyone
else
on
the
planet
work
in
concert
with
vmware
and
pivotal
to
meet
all
our
customer
need
in
the
big
new
world
of
data
alan
push
back
there
be
plenty
of
people
out
there
who
say
that
the
we
re
gonna
do
it
all
approach
have
its
pitfall
he
say
that
there
s
a
benefit
to
focus
a
benefit
to
say
we
re
gonna
be
the
one
company
that
do
this
one
piece
well
than
anyone
else
why
do
you
reject
that
approach
well
everybody
s
entitle
to
their
opinion
i
say
what
i
can
tell
you
be
that
in
our
first
quarter
we
have
a
billion
dollar
more
revenue
than
we
plan
for
when
we
go
to
a
customer
and
say
you
re
buying
ten
thing
you
re
buying
six
or
seven
of
them
from
us
why
don
t
you
buy
all
ten
from
us
and
the
percentage
of
customer
that
be
say
yes
be
remarkably
high
none
of
our
competitor
have
the
unique
set
of
capability
or
the
breadth
we
have
as
i
write
these
word
the
percentage
of
customer
say
yes
be
high
than
ever
and
that
s
great
for
us
for
our
year
end
january
even
in
the
midst
of
a
global
pandemic
we
record
our
high
ever
revenue
profit
and
cash
flow
if
you
be
keep
score
the
value
of
our
equity
in
the
eight
year
since
the
announcement
of
the
go
private
increase
by
over
percent
and
our
enterprise
value
increase
to
over
billion
not
bad
for
a
business
that
be
thought
to
be
dead
in
but
just
as
excite
to
me
as
our
company
s
growth
and
success
be
the
head
spin
possibility
of
technology
what
i
call
a
cambrian
explosion
in
the
world
of
big
data


five
hundred
and
forty
million
year
ago
during
the
first
geological
period
of
the
paleozoic
era
aka
the
cambrian
life
on
earth
previously
limited
to
single
cell
organism
suddenly
explode
in
biological
diversity
nobody
know
exactly
why
it
happen
what
we
have
a
well
handle
on
be
the
similarly
dramatic
technology
driven
explosion
of
data
that
begin
in
the
mid
s
and
continue
to
this
day
at
an
ever
accelerate
rate
in
a
uc
berkeley
report
estimate
that
about
five
exabyte
of
data
five
time
to
the
sixth
power
or
five
billion
billion
be
produce
in
about
twice
as
much
as
be
produce
in
by
the
year
egon
and
i
try
to
explain
the
depth
and
breadth
of
the
new
dell
s
technological
reach
to
alan
murray
the
size
of
the
global
datasphere
the
amount
of
data
create
capture
and
replicate
in
any
give
year
have
increase
five
thousandfold
to
zettabyte
trillion
gigabyte
or
billion
trillion
byte
the
follow
year
the
number
rise
to
zettabyte
by
it
have
hit
zettabyte
by
it
s
project
to
reach
those
be
almost
incomprehensibly
huge
number
what
do
they
really
mean
that
day
in
aspen
i
explain
to
alan
murray
what
they
meant
in
term
of
our
business
how
uniquely
position
we
be
to
address
all
our
customer
data
need
in
a
broad
range
of
modality
but
what
i
find
myself
think
about
constantly
be
how
this
cambrian
explosion
have
create
a
fourth
industrial
revolution
and
how
thrill
this
be
in
the
first
industrial
revolution
water
and
steam
power
mechanize
production
in
the
second
electric
power
create
mass
production
in
the
third
which
begin
in
the
middle
of
the
twentieth
century
electronics
and
information
technology
automate
production
and
the
fourth
industrial
revolution
which
we
re
in
the
midst
of
now
be
building
on
the
third
but
with
an
explosion
of
new
technology
that
be
break
the
boundary
between
the
physical
the
digital
and
the
biological
this
fourth
revolution
also
merges
the
world
of
business
and
technology
the
way
i
describe
this
when
talk
with
businesspeople
be
that
the
domain
of
technology
be
no
longer
in
the
it
department
the
whole
company
be
technology
i
m
talk
about
all
company
if
you
re
try
to
make
car
or
medical
device
or
any
kind
of
product
at
all
and
you
want
to
have
new
customer
technology
be
the
fulcrum
of
progress
in
everything
you
re
do
it
s
a
totally
different
ball
game
than
it
be
twenty
or
thirty
year
ago
and
almost
every
company
in
the
world
be
in
the
throe
of
figure
it
all
out
it
use
to
be
that
a
computer
cost
a
gazillion
dollar
and
you
have
to
wear
a
special
coat
to
go
in
this
room
that
only
certain
people
be
allow
in
and
it
make
a
big
loud
noise
then
the
price
go
from
a
gazillion
dollar
to
that
s
where
i
come
in
and
then
it
go
to
and
now
computer
cost
one
penny
and
they
re
in
everything
we
re
all
walk
around
with
two
or
three
or
four
portable
data
center
with
us
at
all
time
and
that
number
be
only
go
up
there
s
a
company
in
the
uk
call
arm
holding
which
design
something
call
the
arm
processor
this
be
a
microprocessor
that
they
license
and
that
s
in
pretty
much
any
gadget
gizmo
or
smartphone
you
can
think
of
there
be
more
than
billion
arm
base
chip
in
the
world
today
do
the
math
there
be
seven
billion
people
in
the
world
but
of
course
maybe
only
four
to
five
billion
of
the
seven
billion
be
hooked
up
so
far
that
s
a
lot
of
processor
per
person
and
those
processor
be
get
more
and
more
powerful
more
of
them
be
get
hooked
up
all
the
time
and
now
g
and
ai
be
come
and
all
the
previous
tech
that
we
thought
be
so
advanced
be
just
the
pregame
show
to
what
s
on
the
way
g
be
especially
thrill
from
connect
people
to
connect
thing
as
in
internet
of
thing
iot
it
s
not
about
talk
on
the
phone
faster
it
s
about
make
everything
in
the
world
intelligent
and
connect
personal
computer
with
their
interaction
between
user
and
machine
will
continue
to
be
important
in
the
future
but
a
much
big
part
of
the
future
will
be
machine
talk
to
each
other
all
those
thing
in
the
iot
smart
autonomous
vehicle
and
smart
street
building
city
factory
hospital
and
much
much
more
will
generate
almost
incomprehensibly
massive
amount
of
data
all
organization
need
to
turn
that
data
into
a
competitive
advantage
and
to
continuously
improve
everything
they
re
do
but
analyze
data
at
the
scale
in
which
it
s
now
be
create
cannot
be
do
by
human
it
can
only
be
carry
out
effectively
through
artificial
intelligence
and
machine
learn
analysis
by
ai
and
ml
will
create
new
insight
dramatically
improve
every
sector
from
commerce
to
health
care
education
and
finance
even
government
the
next
decade
of
the
information
revolution
catalyze
by
ai
and
big
data
will
impact
every
industry
and
every
aspect
of
our
life
while
the
internet
drove
great
change
and
advance
this
ai
and
data
revolution
will
be
big
and
these
change
will
come
faster
than
most
people
expect
at
the
same
time
it
s
imperative
that
ai
reflect
our
humanity
and
value
for
us
as
a
company
this
mean
profit
and
purpose
not
profit
at
all
cost
this
be
reflect
in
our
goal
which
i
ll
have
more
to
say
about
in
a
minute


the
world
of
compute
be
extend
out
to
the
physical
world
the
place
where
they
meet
be
call
the
edge
a
lot
be
go
on
there
now
much
more
will
be
happen
soon
while
percent
of
the
global
population
be
currently
connect
digitally
an
amaze
number
that
we
take
for
grant
by
percent
of
humanity
will
be
connect
g
will
be
the
platform
for
building
a
smart
new
world
a
digital
nervous
system
g
will
be
software
define
enable
the
multicloud
world
which
will
include
edge
cloud
telco
cloud
private
cloud
and
public
cloud
a
collection
of
cloud
work
together
be
the
digital
future
and
so
we
re
throw
substantial
resource
into
building
the
dell
technology
cloud
and
dell
technology
be
a
leader
in
innovation
in
all
the
aforementioned
area
and
more
invest
more
than
billion
a
year
in
r
d
we
now
have
over
thirty
two
thousand
patent
grant
and
pending
i
m
giddy
with
excitement
about
all
of
it
it
isn
t
just
because
i
love
technology
it
s
because
i
love
how
technology
be
make
the
world
well
now
obviously
technology
itself
be
kind
of
neutral
it
can
do
good
thing
and
bad
thing
but
as
i
see
it
mostly
there
be
good
people
who
want
to
do
good
thing
maybe
you
disagree
maybe
you
ve
see
too
many
movie
where
the
evil
computer
take
over
or
the
suitcase
bomb
destroys
a
city
or
people
have
chip
implant
in
them
that
cause
them
to
do
the
bidding
of
some
evil
villain
hollywood
have
always
do
a
really
good
job
of
frighten
us
about
technological
innovation
but
let
s
not
lay
all
the
blame
on
hollywood
storyteller
from
the
begin
of
time
have
manage
to
scare
people
about
new
thing
probably
as
soon
as
fire
be
discover
there
be
rumor
go
around
about
all
the
awful
thing
that
it
could
do
when
in
fact
fire
change
humanity
for
the
well
from
the
start
technology
be
like
fire
it
can
warm
us
it
can
light
the
way
for
virtually
every
problem
in
the
world
there
s
a
technological
solution
look
at
health
care
there
be
ton
of
example
where
technology
be
advance
drug
discovery
and
diagnosis
and
treatment
death
of
mother
in
childbirth
and
death
from
malaria
have
decrease
radically
over
recent
decade
technology
have
have
much
to
do
with
the
rise
in
literacy
and
the
reduction
of
poverty
in
the
world
over
the
same
period
in
billion
people
live
in
extreme
poverty
today
it
s
about
million
one
billion
people
lift
out
of
extreme
poverty
in
the
last
twenty
year
access
to
clean
drinking
water
and
basic
form
of
education
have
increase
dramatically
as
have
the
gdp
of
develop
nation
and
where
health
care
and
literacy
progress
economy
advance
now
there
s
one
pesky
problem
there
as
economy
advance
they
become
increasingly
specialized
and
with
the
rise
in
specialization
income
inequality
grows
deeper
as
technology
proliferates
in
an
advance
economy
clever
people
figure
out
how
to
innovate
maybe
they
re
come
up
with
algorithm
for
ai
maybe
they
re
make
transportation
autonomous
or
use
network
effect
and
digital
information
to
transform
an
industry
for
the
well
or
create
brain
machine
interface
not
everybody
can
do
that
and
if
you
re
really
good
at
it
you
might
make
a
whole
lot
of
money

i
do
not

with
my

keenly
aware
not

also
of
the
poverty

despair
in
which
so
many
people
still
find
themselves
even
as

help

far
more
than
write
a
check
it
mean
understand
the
problem
of
poverty
at
a
community
level
which
be
why
we
built
local
team
in
regional
office
to
attack
those
problem
at
their
root
for
example
we
saw
a
challenge
in
the
number
of
low
income
high
school
student
who
have
decent
grade
but
weren
t
at
the
top
of
their
class
so
couldn
t
get
to
college
and
then
make
it
through
to
a
degree
one
of
our
first
initiative
be
to
launch
the
dell
scholar
program
in
the
us
to
meet
both
the
financial
and
psychosocial
need
of
student
with
this
profile
many
of
whom
be
first
in
their
family
to
go
to
college
we
also
believe
in
set
aspirational
goal
so
even
though
at
the
begin
only
percent
of
these
student
of
the
small
fraction
of
those
actually
succeed
in
get
to
college
make
it
all
the
way
to
graduation
we
set
a
goal
of
an
percent
graduation
rate
more
than
four
time
the
national
average
our
fifteen
year
average
be
percent
and
we
now
have
thousand
of
dell
scholar
alum
across
the
united
state
with
degree
and
great
job
in
hand
and
there
s
still
room
for
improvement
pbns
we
follow
this
initiative
with
the
dell
young
leader
program
in
south
africa
which
be
similar
but
customize
to
the
specific
need
of
young
people
in
that
country
include
specialized
support
to
ensure
graduate
a
successful
transition
into
their
first
job
over
the
past
twenty
year
the
lesson
learn
from
these
program
have
grown
into
a
spectrum
of
support
for
many
different
nonprofit
that
support
low
income
university
student
as
a
result
one
of
our
current
goal
be
to
help
over
low
income
student
globally
earn
university
degree
every
year
another
initiative
start
with
a
problem
we
saw
among
family
in
the
urban
slum
of
india
there
be
no
responsible
financial
service
available
to
the
poor
who
when
they
get
into
a
cash
crunch
be
force
to
borrow
at
exorbitant
rate
from
moneylender
a
single
big
financial
hit
medical
expense
weather
related
job
loss
etc
could
throw
a
family
back
into
desperate
poverty
yet
at
the
same
time
south
asia
be
one
of
the
big
microfinance
center
in
the
world
in
rural
area
we
want
to
help
bring
microfinance
to
india
s
city
we
start
by
try
to
make
grant
available
to
entrepreneur
but
our
foundation
team
on
the
ground
in
india
s
city
quickly
determine
that
seed
capital
not
grant
capital
be
what
be
need
to
bring
the
entrepreneur
into
the
urban
core
to
test
the
viability
of
a
new
model
thus
we
embark
on
a
fifteen
year
journey
to
support
microfinance
entrepreneur
in
india
s
big
city
through
investment
of
equity
and
debt
ultimately
enable
responsible
microloans
to
million
of
indian
family
the
foundation
s
effort
not
only
help
prove
the
financial
viability
of
the
model
but
also
played
a
vital
role
in
the
growth
of
urban
microfinance
which
today
account
for
more
than
percent
of
the
total
microfinance
business
in
india
we
then
saw
opportunity
to
extend
this
work
into
specialized
credit
for
individual
and
small
entrepreneur
and
today
we
continue
to
work
toward
our
goal
of
improve
the
financial
stability
of
over
million
low
income
family
globally
every
year
by
create
access
to
responsible
financial
service

to
give

great
education
option
we
ve
support
thousand
of
program
in

it
quickly

clear
that
the
tool
available

that
let
them

corporation
and
then
they
end
up
in
a
dumpster
somewhere
and
they
ve
all
get
my
name
on
them
not
good
so
from
the
start
we
ve
be
think
about
recycle
and
take
back
program
for
all
the
material
that
go
in
these
thing
how
do
we
create
the
small
environmental
footprint
possible
with
what
we
manufacture
this
kind
of
think
seem
to
come
naturally
from
be
base
in
austin
whose
physical
beauty
inspires
environmental
awareness
start
way
back
in
our
early
day
when
we
be
only
people
as
oppose
to
i
would
go
to
our
team
and
say
let
s
come
up
with
a
way
to
use
cleaner
greener
material
and
consume
less
energy
and
make
the
packaging
more
environmentally
friendly
look
at
asbestos
i
told
my
team
long
ago
company
that
be
put
asbestos
in
their
product
weren
t
sit
around
say
hey
this
stuff
be
really
bad
it
s
go
to
kill
a
lot
of
people
let
s
figure
out
how
to
use
a
lot
of
it
i
think
they
just
didn
t
know
so
from
the
begin
we
always
ask
what
be
we
do
unknowingly
that
might
be
dangerous
not
because
there
be
a
rule
or
some
regulator
be
go
to
show
up
but
because
it
just
felt
right
and
here
s
the
thing
we
found
with
our
engineer
when
we
told
them
that
we
want
to
minimize
environmental
impact
with
our
product
but
didn
t
want
them
to
cost
any
more
they
thought
it
be
the
coolest
challenge
ever
they
totally
rise
to
the
occasion
rise
to
the
occasion
be
what
we
re
about
in

today
that
be
complicate
multilayered
and
can
sometimes
seem
insurmountable
it
say
the
status
quo
will
not
get
us
to
the
kind
of

we
need
in

another

we

frequently
met

them
on

our
moon

an
equivalent

with
every

thing
that
we

all

i
recently
get
a
sweet
note
from
a
woman
who
d
just
retire
after

for
us
for
almost
thirty
year
she
kept
a
copy
of
the
advertisement
that
she
reply
to
back
in
the
early
s
the
second
paragraph

it
doesn
t
matter
where
you
come
from
it
doesn

matter
what
you
look
like
that
appeal
to
her
and
that
s
why
she
apply
for
the
job
i
don

like
to
brag
but
i
don
t
think
a
lot
of
other
tech
company
operate
this
way
back
then
we
do
a
lot
of
thing
before
anybody
have
to
ask
us
to
we
never
have
anybody

us
the
right
thing
to
do
we
re
say
and
do
the

thing
today
but
we
re
work
harder
than
ever
toward

not

because

the
fresh
perspective

idea
all
the
terrific
people
we
haven
t
met
yet
be
bound
to
bring
to
our

there
be
much
much
more
we
have
reduce
our
annual
operational
greenhouse

percent
since
and
we
plan
to
cut
our

over
the
next
decade
we
will
source
percent
of

across
all
dell
facility

and
percent
by
we
will
continue
to
insist
as
a
condition
of
do

respect
and

for
every

of
the
hundred
of
thousand
of

who
create
our

this

not
just
expect
but
demand
safe
and
healthy
workplace
across
our
supply
chain
and
meeting
and

alliance
of
which
we
re
a
found
member
we
will
continue
to
promote
our
belief
that
technology
have
the
power
to
help
solve
the
world
s
most
serious
social
problem
we
ll
keep
explore
new
way
to
collaborate
with
the
public
sector
to
address
these
issue
as
in
india
where
we
ve
join
with
the
ministry
of
health
and
family
welfare
and
our
partner
the
tata
trust
to
develop
digital
lifecare
which
us
dell
technology
to
deliver
preventive
health
screening
of
noncommunicable
disease
at
nation
level
scale


this
past
year
have
be
like
no
other
that
i
ve
experienced
in
the
thirty
seven
year
i
ve
be
privileged
to
lead
this
company
in
the
pandemic
we
re
all
face
a
crisis
for
which
there
be
no
playbook
but
dell
have
always
be
about
a
culture
of
optimism
a
belief
that
technology
amplifies
human
potential
with
people
at
the
center
of
what
we
do
when
covid
hit
you
saw
different
outcome
for
different
kind
of
business
those
that
be
more
digitally
enable
tend
to
do
well
than
those
that
weren
t
and
as
a
company
that
over
the
past
decade
and
a
half
have
invest
heavily
in
our
digital
transformation
we
found
ourselves
in
a
uniquely
resilient
position
at
dell
technology
we
told
everyone
in
march
that
they
should
work
at
home
if
they
could
this
work
surprisingly
well
when
we
have
to
move
a
hundred
thousand
people
to
work
at
home
it
happen
over
a
weekend
maybe
we
shouldn
t
have
be
surprised
we
have
tool
process
and
the
kind
of
business
that
naturally
allow
people
to
work
remotely
and
we
have
a
culture
of
flexible
work
that
have
start
back
in
everything
continued
in
fact
our
productivity
improve
which
be
a
fortunate
thing
because
as
it
happen
the
pandemic
increase
demand
for
all
our
product
both
physical
and
digital
though
covid
have
brought
great
human
tragedy
and
economic
devastation
it
s
produce
other
story
line
at
the
same
time
for
one
the
worldwide
reduction
in
greenhouse
gas
and
then
there
be
the
revelation
of
how
much
work
could
actually
be
continued
when
everything
go
online
we
d
often
encounter
the
question
of
how
to
match
a
customer
s
business
opportunity
a
particular
problem
they
want
to
solve
with
the
right
specialist
take
a
hypothetical
customer
in
australia
in
the
past
we
d
find
a
guru
in
house
and
fly
him
or
her
out
there
well
that
s
four
day
just
in
travel
time
a
lot
of
time
and
a
lot
of
money
on
the
other
hand
travel
on
zoom
airline
be
incredibly
efficient
all
around
and
we
ve
found
that
all
our
customer
seem
happy
work
this
way
i
think
you
can
see
this
massive
shift
in
work
method
as
a
glimpse
of
the
future
i
don
t
think
we
re
go
back
to
the
way
it
be
before
there
be
still
question
how
for
example
do
you
train
new
team
member
there
be
efficiency
to
be
gain
in
do
it
remotely
but
there
be
loss
too
in
a
world
of
video
work
how
do
you
reproduce
the
idea
people
have
after
bumping
into
each
other
in
the
hall
or
by
the
water
cooler
we
ve
be
work
hard
to
try
to
find
answer
one
positive
thing
we
ve
found
be
that
with
online
meeting
you
get
far
more
participation
than
you
would
in
a
physical
context
more
people
can
be
include
for
one
thing
take
a
hypothetical
customer
who
come
to
round
rock
with
eight
people
over
two
day
of
meeting
and
dinner
etc
online
that
customer
may
include
thirty
or
forty
people
from
their
company
instead
of
eight
and
get
just
as
high
a
level
of
engagement
we
also
see
this
internally
when
people
have
to
work
remotely
they
have
a
great
desire
to
be
connect
in
the
midst
of
the
pandemic
dell
technology
have
dedicate
considerable
technical
resource
like
supercomputer
which
be
an
enormous
number
of
server
connect
together
to
understand
the
virus
and
accelerate
the
development
of
therapeutic
drug
and
treatment
i
promise
that
when
someone
in
the
future
asks
how
do
you
conquer
the
pandemic
technology
will
have
be
a
big
part
of
the
solution
i
think
we
ll
look
back
on
this
period
for
all
its
difficulty
as
a
time
of
massive
acceleration
of
digital
process
and
yes
transformation


i
don
t
know
why
people
aren
t
more
curious
and
why
curiosity
isn
t
consider
a
more
important
leadership
trait
a
journalist
once
ask
me
if
i
be
ever
bore
as
a
kid
i
only
have
to
think
about
it
for
a
second
i
never
be
not
even
for
a
minute
because
i
be
so
curious
every
day
i
d
wake
up
excite
by
all
the
new
thing
there
be
to
learn
about
i
feel
much
the
same
way
today
change
true
transformation
be
a
race
with
no
finish
line
which
mean
there
s
so
much
more
out
there
for
me
for
all
of
us
to
learn
about
how
cool
be
that
