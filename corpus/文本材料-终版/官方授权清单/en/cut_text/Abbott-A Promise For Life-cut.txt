the

in

dr

a

have

hit
a

soon
the

would
enhance
not

their

by
add
electrolyte
and

the

key
to
the

recovery
be

long
an
area
of
accomplishment
and
of
strategic
investment
it
would
be
the
next
great

to
bounce
back
from
the
financial
impact
of
the

abbott
rely

the

the
big
news
in
diagnostics
arrive
the
follow
year
we
be
bring
together
all
our

announce

among
the
goal
of
the

low

a
major
abbott
focus
be
now
to

disease
prevention
as
well
as
treatment
this
emphasis
on
price
and
on
early
diagnosis
and
prevention
prove
a
wise
one
in
the
s
a
time
of

especially
regard
the
cost
of
healthcare
product
that
held
down
such
cost
by
prevent
the
need
for
expensive
long
term
care
be
especially
value
by
hospital
doctor
and
clinic
another
societal
trend
work
in
abbott
s
favor
be
an
explosion
in
healthcare
litigation
in
the
first
half
of
the
s
the
cost
of
medical
malpractice
insurance
rise
by
more
than
percent
with
so
many
malpractice
suit
ledder
explain
doctor

turn
more

more
to

to
be
sure
their

we
disagree

dale
he
say
we
think
hiv
make
a

we
d
like
to
borrow
some
of
your
compound
to
see
if
they
can
inhibit
that
protease
of
course
you
can
reply
kempf

i
think
i
can
make
well

for

during

he
quickly
transfer

the

have
become

he
note
and
if
there
be
a
way
that
i
could
somehow
contribute
to
stop
it
that
s
what
i
want
over
the
next
year
and
a
half
kempf
and
two
other
chemist
get
down

they

they
use
computer
graphic

to
build
a

of
the

the

look
rather
like
two

the

they
turn
to
a

many

nmr
allow
even
the

of
a

to

with
this
knowledge
kempf
and
his

make
hundred
of

methodically
heating

meanwhile
the

major
at

college
norbeck
be
drawn
to
what
he
term
the
romance
of
science
and
go
on
to
earn
a
ph
d
in
organic
chemistry
from
cal

when
i
be
in
graduate
school
he
recall
i
start
reading
about
this
new
disease
it
grabbed
everyone
s
attention
people
kept
ask
what
s
the
cause
be
there
a
cure
it
be
excite
to
come
and
work
on
something
so
important
at
length
the
scientist
create
a
compound
that
appear
to
inhibit
the
hiv
protease
and
stop
the
virus
from
grow
in

in

as
oppose
to
in

in
a
living
be
abbott
add
resource
to
the
effort
and
scientist
tackle
the
first
test
of
the
inhibitor
on
laboratory
rat
here
they
hit
a
major
roadblock
the
animal
bloodstream
readily
absorbed
the
substance
but
their
liver
just
as
quickly
remove
it
before
the
molecule
could
do
its
job
the
researcher
go
back
to
the
draw
board
create
and
try
out
hundred
of
variant
of
the
molecule
there
be
time
when
we
d
ask
ourselves
remember
norbeck
do
we
really
have
the
skill
to
be
competitive
in
this
area
but
in
come
a
eureka
moment
as
soon
as
we
put
it
into
rat
for
the
first
time
remember
kempf
we
knew
we
have
something
special
instead
of
rapidly
disappear
it
stayed
in
the
blood
for
more
than
eight
hour
the
substance
be
dubbed
ritonavir
the
next
year
another
key
player
join
the
hiv
team
to
lead
it
through
its
clinical
trial

this
be
dr
john

leonard
later
abbott
s
senior
vice

development
he
have
fought
the
disease
before
in
san
francisco
near
the
begin
of
the
aid
epidemic
in
the
early
s
it
be
an
excite
period
because
the
biotech
industry
be
get
start
leonard
remember
i
decide
i
could
best
serve
others
by
figure
out
how
to
make
new
medicine
a
molecular
virologist
who
have
study
at
john
hopkins
and
stanford
leonard
recall
the
day
not
long
after
join
abbott
as
head
of
its
antiviral
venture
team
when
a
co
worker
have
visit
his
new
office
she
told
him
where
i
use
to
work
we
always
look
for
something
to
celebrate
to
liven
thing
up
we
should
do
that
here
leonard
answer
you
know
how
football
player
celebrate
a
touchdown
by
spike
the
ball
maybe
we
should
do
that
day
later
his
friend
hand
leonard
a
wrap
box
inside
be
a
nerf
football
okay
he
laugh
it
go
on
my
windowsill
we
ll
use
it
on
special
occasion
over
the
course
of
the
effort
the
nerf
ball
would
gather
dust
seem
to
mock
leonard
and
his
team
s
herculean
effort
involve
the
creation
and
test
of
hundred
of
promising
compound
during
this
period
of
early
test
cost
be
high
and
progress
uncertain
and
slow
at
first
ritonavir
cost
a
kilogram
to
produce
at
that
price
a
patient
would
go
through
about
of
the

in
a
year
as
a
company
abbott
have
to
balance
the
chance
of
a
successful
new
drug
versus
the
uncertainty
and
cost
of
drug
development
on

only
one
compound
in
ten

make
it
all
the

after

development

i
can
say
there
be
time
when
this

hung
by
the
thinnest
of

i
can
recall
hodgson
when
he
seem

be
ask
for
a
reason
to
believe
you
read
about
a
breakthrough
medicine
leonard
continued
and
people
on
the
outside
think
all
of
this
be
automatic
but
on
the
inside
sometimes
the
destiny
of
a
new
drug
depends
on
the
outcome
of
a
conversation
between
two
people
the
next
challenge
be
to
test
the

a

what
we
saw
state
leonard
be
something
we
do
not
expect
the

have
fall
to
level
that
be
less
than
percent
of
what
