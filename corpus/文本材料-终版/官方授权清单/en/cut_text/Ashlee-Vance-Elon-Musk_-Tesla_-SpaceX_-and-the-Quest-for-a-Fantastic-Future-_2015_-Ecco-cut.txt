
elon
s
world
do
you
think
i
m
insane
this
question
come
from
elon
musk
near
the
very
end
of
a
long
dinner
we
share
at
a
high
end
seafood
restaurant
in
silicon
valley
i
d
gotten
to
the
restaurant
first
and
settle
down
with
a
gin
and
tonic
know
musk
would
as
ever
be
late
after
about
fifteen
minute
musk
show
up
wear
leather
shoe
designer
jean
and
a
plaid
dress
shirt
musk
stand
six
foot
one
but
ask
anyone
who
know
him
and
they
ll
confirm
that
he
seem
much
big
than
that
he
s
absurdly
broad
shoulder
sturdy
and
thick
you
d
figure
he
would
use
this
frame
to
his
advantage
and
perform
an
alpha
male
strut
when
enter
a
room
instead
he
tends
to
be
almost
sheepish
it
s
head
tilt
slightly
down
while
walk
a
quick
handshake
hello
after
reach
the
table
and
then
butt
in
seat
from
there
musk
need
a
few
minute
before
he
warms
up
and
look
at
ease
musk
ask
me
to
dinner
for
a
negotiation
of
sort
eighteen
month
earlier
i
d
inform
him
of
my
plan
to
write
a
book
about
him
and
he
d
inform
me
of
his
plan
not
to
cooperate
his
rejection
stung
but
thrust
me
into
dog
reporter
mode
if
i
have
to
do
this
book
without
him
so
be
it
plenty
of
people
have
left
musk
s
company
tesla
motor
and
spacex
and
would
talk
and
i
already
knew
a
lot
of
his
friend
the
interview
follow
one
after
another
month
after
month
and
two
hundred
or
so
people
into
the
process
i
heard
from
musk
once
again
he
call
me
at
home
and
declare
that
thing
could
go
one
of
two
way
he
could
make
my
life
very
difficult
or
he
could
help
with
the
project
after
all
he
d
be
willing
to
cooperate
if
he
could
read
the
book
before
it
go
to
publication
and
could
add
footnote
throughout
it
he
would
not
meddle
with
my
text
but
he
want
the
chance
to
set
the
record
straight
in
spot
that
he
deem
factually
inaccurate
i
understood
where
this
be
come
from
musk
want
a
measure
of
control
over
his
life
s
story
he
s
also
wire
like
a
scientist
and
suffers
mental
anguish
at
the
sight
of
a
factual
error
a
mistake
on
a
print
page
would
gnaw
at
his
soul
forever
while
i
could
understand
his
perspective
i
could
not
let
him
read
the
book
for
professional
personal
and
practical
reason
musk
have
his
version
of
the
truth
and
it
s
not
always
the
version
of
the
truth
that
the
rest
of
the
world
share
he
s
prone
to
verbose
answer
to
even
the
simplest
of
question
as
well
and
the
thought
of
thirty
page
footnote
seem
all
too
real
still
we
agree
to
have
dinner
chat
all
this
out
and
see
where
it
left
us
our
conversation
begin
with
a
discussion
of
public
relation
people
musk
burn
through
pr
staffer
notoriously
fast
and
tesla
be
in
the
process
of
hunt
for
a
new
communication
chief
who
be
the
best
pr
person
in
the
world
he
ask
in
a
very
muskian
fashion
then
we
talk
about
mutual
acquaintance
howard
hughes
and
the
tesla
factory
when
the
waiter
stop
by
to
take
our
order
musk
ask
for
suggestion
that
would
work
with
his
low
carb
diet
he
settle
on
chunk
of
fry
lobster
soak
in
black
squid
ink
the
negotiation
hadn
t
begin
and
musk
be
already
dish
he
open
up
about
the
major
fear
keep
him
up
at
night
namely
that
google
s
cofounder
and
ceo
larry
page
might
well
have
be
building
a
fleet
of
artificial
intelligence
enhance
robot
capable
of
destroy
mankind
i
m
really
worried
about
this
musk
say
it
didn
t
make
musk
feel
any
well
that
he
and
page
be
very
close
friend
and
that
he
felt
page
be
fundamentally
a
well
intentioned
person
and
not
dr
evil
in
fact
that
be
sort
of
the
problem
page
s
nice
guy
nature
left
him
assume
that
the
machine
would
forever
do
our
bidding
i
m
not
as
optimistic
musk
say
he
could
produce
something
evil
by
accident
as
the
food
arrive
musk
consume
it
that
be
he
didn
t
eat
it
as
much
as
he
make
it
disappear
rapidly
with
a
few
gargantuan
bite
desperate
to
keep
musk
happy
and
chat
i
hand
him
a
big
chunk
of
steak
from
my
plate
the
plan
work
for
all
of
ninety
second
meat
hunk
go
it
take
awhile
to
get
musk
off
the
artificial
intelligence
doom
and
gloom
talk
and
to
the
subject
at
hand
then
as
we
drift
toward
the
book
musk
start
to
feel
me
out
probe
exactly
why
it
be
that
i
want
to
write
about
him
and
calculate
my
intention
when
the
moment
present
itself
i
move
in
and
seize
the
conversation
some
adrenaline
release
and
mixed
with
the
gin
and
i
launch
into
what
be
meant
to
be
a
forty
five
minute
sermon
about
all
the
reason
musk
should
let
me
burrow
deep
into
his
life
and
do
so
while
get
exactly
none
of
the
control
he
want
in
return
the
speech
revolve
around
the
inherent
limitation
of
footnote
musk
come
off
like
a
control
freak
and
my
journalistic
integrity
be
compromise
to
my
great
surprise
musk
cut
me
off
after
a
couple
of
minute
and
simply
say
okay
one
thing
that
musk
hold
in
the
high
regard
be
resolve
and
he
respect
people
who
continue
on
after
be
told
no
dozen
of
other
journalist
have
ask
him
to
help
with
a
book
before
but
i
d
be
the
only
annoy
asshole
who
continued
on
after
musk
s
initial
rejection
and
he
seem
to
like
that
the
dinner
wound
down
with
pleasant
conversation
and
musk
lay
waste
to
the
low
carb
diet
a
waiter
show
up
with
a
giant
yellow
cotton
candy
desert
sculpture
and
musk
dug
into
it
rip
off
handful
of
the
sugary
fluff
it
be
settle
musk
grant
me
access
to
the
executive
at
his
company
his
friend
and
his
family
he
would
meet
me
for
dinner
once
a
month
for
as
long
as
it
take
for
the
first
time
musk
would
let
a
reporter
see
the
inner
working
of
his
world
two
and
a
half
hour
after
we
start
musk
put
his
hand
on
the
table
make
a
move
to
get
up
and
then
pause
lock
eye
with
me
and
bust
out
that
incredible
question
do
you
think
i
m
insane
the
oddity
of
the
moment
left
me
speechless
for
a
beat
while
my
every
synapse
fire
try
to
figure
out
if
this
be
some
sort
of
riddle
and
if
so
how
it
should
be
answer
artfully
it
be
only
after
i
d
spent
lot
of
time
with
musk
that
i
realize
the
question
be
more
for
him
than
me
nothing
i
say
would
have
matter
musk
be
stop
one
last
time
and
wonder
aloud
if
i
could
be
trust
and
then
look
into
my
eye
to
make
his
judgment
a
split
second
later
we
shook
hand
and
musk
drove
off
in
a
red
tesla
model
s
sedan
any
study
of
elon
musk
must
begin
at
the
headquarters
of
spacex
in
hawthorne
california
a
suburb
of
los
angeles
locate
a
few
mile
from
los
angeles
international
airport
it
s
there
that
visitor
will
find
two
giant
poster
of
mar
hang
side
by
side
on
the
wall
lead
up
to
musk
s
cubicle
the
poster
to
the
left
depicts
mar
as
it
be
today
a
cold
barren
red
orb
the
poster
on
the
right
show
a
mar
with
a
humongous
green
landmass
surround
by
ocean
the
planet
have
be
heat
up
and
transform
to
suit
human
musk
fully
intend
to
try
and
make
this
happen
turn
human
into
space
colonizer
be
his
state
life
s
purpose
i
would
like
to
die
think
that
humanity
have
a
bright
future
he
say
if
we
can
solve
sustainable
energy
and
be
well
on
our
way
to
become
a
multiplanetary
specie
with
a
self
sustain
civilization
on
another
planet
to
cope
with
a
bad
case
scenario
happen
and
extinguish
human
consciousness
then
and
here
he
pause
for
a
moment
i
think
that
would
be
really
good
if
some
of
the
thing
that
musk
say
and
do
sound
absurd
that
s
because
on
one
level
they
very
much
be
on
this
occasion
for
example
musk
s
assistant
have
just
hand
him
some
cooky
and
cream
ice
cream
with
sprinkle
on
top
and
he
then
talk
earnestly
about
save
humanity
while
a
blotch
of
the
dessert
hung
from
his
low
lip
musk
s
ready
willingness
to
tackle
impossible
thing
have
turn
him
into
a
deity
in
silicon
valley
where
fellow
ceo
like
page
speak
of
him
in
reverential
awe
and
budding
entrepreneur
strive
to
be
like
elon
just
as
they
have
be
strive
in
year
past
to
mimic
steve

silicon

though
operates
within
a
warp
version
of
reality
and
outside
the
confines
of
its
share
fantasy
musk
often
come
off
as
a
much
more
polarize
figure
he
s
the
guy
with
the
electric
car
solar
panel
and

false

about
the

you

make
of
the

for
a
while
i
d
long
be
a
subscriber
to
this
latter
camp
musk
have
struck
me
as
a
well
intentioned
dreamer
a
card
carry
member
of
silicon
valley
s
techno
utopian
club
this
group
tends
to
be
a
mix
of
ayn
rand
devotee
and
engineer
absolutist
who
see
their
hyperlogical
worldviews
as
the
answer
for
everyone
if
we
d
just
get
out
of
their
way
they
d
fix
all
our
problem
one
day
soon
enough
we
ll
be
able
to
download
our
brain
to
a
computer
relax
and
let
their
algorithm
take
care
of
everything
much
of
their
ambition
prof
inspire
and
their
work
helpful
but
the
techno
utopian
do
get
tiresome
with
their
platitude
and
their
ability
to
prattle
on
for
hour
without
say
much
of
substance
more
disconcert
be
their
underlie
message
that
human
be
flaw
and
our
humanity
be
an
annoy
burden
that
need
to
be
dealt
with
in
due
course
when
i
d
caught
musk
at
silicon
valley
event
his
highfalutin
talk
often
sound
straight
out
of
the
techno
utopian
playbook
and
most
annoyingly
his
world
save
company
didn
t
even
seem
to
be
do
all
that
well
yet
in
the
early
part
of
the
cynic
like
me
have
to
take
notice
of
what
musk
be
actually
accomplish
his
once
beleaguer
company

at
unprecedented
thing
spacex

these
two

musk
to
the

height
among
business

only

in
that
i
decide
to
see
what

and
to
write
a
cover
story
about
him
for

the

the

easy
enough

because

have
instal
a
white

red
obelisk
brand
with
the
tesla
logo
that
sits
in
the

of

it
be
in
my
first
interview
with
musk
which
take
place
at
the
design

that
i
begin
to
get
a
sense
of
how
he
talk
and
operate
he
s
a
confident
guy
but
do
not
always
do
a
good
job
of
display
this
on
initial
encounter
musk
can
come
off
as
shy
and
borderline
awkward
his
south
african
accent
remains
present
but
fading
and
the
charm
of
it
be
not
enough
to
offset
the
halt
nature
of
musk
s
speech
pattern
like
many
an
engineer
or
physicist
musk
will
pause
while
fishing
around
for
exact
phrasing
and
he
ll
often
go
rumble
down
an
esoteric
scientific
rabbit
hole
without
provide
any
help
hand
or
simplify
explanation
along
the
way
musk
expect
you
to
keep
up
none
of
this
be
off
put
musk
in
fact
will
toss
out
plenty
of
joke
and
can
be
downright
charm
it
s
just
that
there
s
a
sense
of
purpose
and
pressure
hang
over
any
conversation
with
the
man
musk
doesn
t
really
shoot
the
shit
it
would
end
up
take
about
thirty
hour
of
interview
for
musk
to
really
loosen
up
and
let
me
into
a
different

down
he
argue
that

i
d
subscribed
to
a
lot
of
this
type
of
think
until
that
first
visit
to

land
while
musk
have
be
anything

shy
about
what
he
be
up
to
few
people
outside

get
to
see
the

to

the

of
what

who
have
take

of
the

ethic
behind
move
quickly

run
organization
free
of

apply
it

that
have
the
potential
to
be
the
real
breakthrough
we
d
be
miss
by
right
musk
should
have
be
part
of
the
malaise
he
jumped
right
into
dot

in

fresh
out
of

musk
make

from
the
deal
and
pour
almost
all
of
it
into
his
next
venture
a
start
up
that
would
morph
into
paypal
as
the
large

in

musk
become
fantastically
well
to
do
when
ebay
acquire
the

instead
of
hang
around

fall
into
the

funk
as
his
peer
however
musk
decamped
to
los

the
conventional
wisdom
of
the

say
to
take
a
deep
breath
and
wait
for
the
next
big
thing
to
arrive
in

reject

musk

that

day
out
when

find
time
to
decompress
but
when
he
do
the

they
be
not

effective
not
long
after
the
sumo
party
i
found
musk
back
at
work
at
the
tesla
headquarters
in
palo
alto
it
be
a
saturday
and
the
parking
lot
be
full
of
car
inside
of
the
tesla
office
hundred
of
young
men

of
them

part
on
computer
and
others
conduct
experiment
with
electronics
equipment
on
their
desk
musk
s
uproarious
laugh
would
erupt
every
few
minute
and
carry
through
the
entire
floor
when
musk
come
into
the
meeting
room
where
i
d
be
wait
i
note
how
impressive
it
be
for
so
many
people
to
turn
up
on
a
saturday
musk
saw
the
situation
in
a
different
light
complain
that
few
and
few
people
have
be
work
weekend
of
late
we
ve
grown
fuck
soft
musk
reply
i
be
just
go
to
send
out
an
e
mail
we
re
fuck
soft
a
word
of
warn
there
s
go
to
be
a
lot
of
fuck
in
this
book
musk
adores
the
word
and
so
do
most
of
the
people
in
his
inner
circle
this
kind
of
declaration
seem
to
fit
with
our
impression
of
other
visionary
it
s
not
hard
to
imagine
howard
hughes
or
steve
job
chastise
their
workforce
in
a
similar
way
building
thing
especially
big
thing
be
a
messy
business
in
the
two
decade
musk
have
spent
create
company
he
s
left
behind
a
trail
of
people
who
either
adore
or
despise
him
during
the
course
of
my
reporting
these
people
line
up
to
give
me
their
take
on
musk
and
the
gory
detail
of
how
he
and
his
business
operate
my
dinner
with
musk
and
periodic
trip
to
musk
land
reveal
a
different
set
of
possible
truth
about
the
man
he
s
set
about
building
something
that
have
the
potential
to
be
much
grander
than
anything
hughes
or
job
produce
musk
have
take
industry
like
aerospace
and
automotive
that
america
seem
to
have
give
up
on
and
recast
them
as
something
new
and
fantastic
at
the
heart
of
this
transformation
be
musk
s
skill
as
a
software
maker
and
his
ability
to
apply
them
to
machine
he
s
merge
atom
and
bit
in
way
that
few
people
thought
possible
and
the
result
have
be
spectacular
it
s
true
enough
that
musk
have
yet
to
have
a
consumer
hit
on
the
order
of
the
iphone
or
to
touch
more
than
one
billion
people
like
facebook
for
the
moment
he
s
still
make
rich
people
s
toy
and
his
budding
empire
could
be
an
explode
rocket
or
massive
tesla
recall
away
from
collapse
on
the
other
hand
musk
s
company
have
already
accomplish
far
more
than
his
loud
detractor
thought
possible
and
the
promise
of
what
s
to
come
have
to
leave
harden
type
feel
optimistic
during
their
weaker
moment
to
me
elon
be
the
shin
example
of
how
silicon
valley
might
be
able
to
reinvent
itself
and
be
more
relevant
than
chase
these
quick
ipo
and
focus
on
get
incremental
product
out
say
edward
jung
a
famed
software
engineer
and
inventor
those
thing
be
important
but
they
be
not
enough
we
need
to
look
at
different
model
of
how
to
do
thing
that
be
longer
term
in
nature
and
where
the
technology
be
more
integrate
the
integration
mention
by
jung
the
harmonious
meld
of
software
electronics
advanced
material
and
compute
horsepower
appear
to
be
musk
s
gift
squint
ever
so
slightly
and
it
look
like
musk
could
be
use
his
skill
to
pave
the
way
toward
an
age
of
astonish
machine
and
science
fiction
dream
make
manifest
in
that
sense
musk
come
off
much
more
like
thomas
edison
than
howard
hughes
he
s
an
inventor
celebrity
businessman
and
industrialist
able
to
take
big
idea
and
turn
them
into

of

a
time
when
this
be
thought
to
be
impossible
born
in
south

musk
now
look
like
america
s
most
innovative
industrialist
and
outlandish
thinker
and
the
person
most
likely
to
set
silicon
valley
on
a
more
ambitious
course
because
of

to
mar
these
advance
be
simultaneously
difficult
to
fathom
and
seemingly
inevitable
if
musk
can
simply
buy
enough
time
to
make
them
work
as
his
ex

musk

not

it
certainly
surpass

twelve

and
that
he
already
have
vision
of
grand

dance
in
his

the

in
this

you

this
game
make
good
use
of

and
animation
and
in
this
sense
make
the
listing
worth
reading
as
of
this
write
not
even
the
internet
know
what
status
beam
machine
be
a
boy
fantasize
about
space
and
battle
between
good
and
evil
be
anything
but
amaze
a
boy
who
take
these
fantasy
seriously
be
more
remarkable
such
be
the
case
with
the
young
elon
musk
by
the
middle
of
his
teenage
year
musk
have
blend
fantasy
and
reality
to
the
point
that
they
be
hard
to
separate
in
his
mind
musk
come
to
see
man
s
fate
in
the
universe
as
a
personal
obligation
if
that
meant
pursue
cleaner
energy
technology
or
building
spaceship
to
extend
the
human
specie
s
reach
then
so
be
it
musk
would
find
a
way
to
make
these
thing
happen
maybe
i
read
too
many
comic
as
a
kid
musk
say
in
the
comic
it
always
seem
like
they
be
try
to
save
the
world
it
seem
like
one
should
try
to
make
the
world
a
well
place
because
the
inverse
make
no
sense
at
around
age
fourteen
musk
have
a
full
on
existential
crisis
he
try
to
deal
with
it
like
many
gift
adolescent
do
turn
to
religious
and
philosophical
text
musk
sample
a
handful
of
ideology
and
then
end
up
more
or
less
back
where
he
have
start
embrace
the
sci
fi
lesson
found
in
one
of
the
most
influential
book
in
his
life
the
hitchhiker
s
guide
to
the
galaxy
by
douglas
adam
he
point
out
that
one
of
the
really
tough
thing
be
figure
out
what
question
to
ask
musk
say
once
you
figure
out
the
question
then
the
answer
be
relatively
easy
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
really
we
should
aspire
to
increase
the
scope
and
scale
of
human
consciousness
in
order
to
well
understand
what
question
to
ask
the
teenage
musk
then
arrive
at
his
ultralogical
mission
statement
the
only
thing
that
make
sense
to
do
be
strive
for
great
collective
enlightenment
he
say
it
s
easy
enough
to
spot
some
of
the
underpinnings
of
musk
s
search
for
purpose
born
in
he
grow
up
in
pretoria
a
large
city
in
the
northeastern
part
of
south
africa
just
an
hour
s
drive
from
johannesburg
the
specter
of
apartheid
be
present
throughout
his
childhood
as
south
africa
frequently
boil
over
with
tension
and
violence
black
and
white
clashed
as
do
black
of

musk
turn
four
year

just
day
after
the
soweto

hundred
of

by

due
to
its
racist
policy
musk
have
the
luxury
of
travel
abroad
during
his
childhood
and
would
have
gotten
a
flavor
for
how
outsider
view
south
africa
but
what
have
even
more
of
an
impact
on
musk
s
personality
be
the
white
afrikaner
culture
so
prevalent
in
pretoria
and
the
surround
area
hypermasculine
behavior
be
celebrate
and
tough
jock
be
revere
while
musk
enjoy
a
level
of
privilege
he
live
as
an
outsider
whose
reserve
personality
and
geeky
inclination
ran
against
the
prevail
attitude
of
the
time
his
notion
that
something
about
the
world
have

anything
you
just
have
to
make
a
decision
and
do
it
in
that
sense
my

would
be
very
proud
of
elon

often
that
elon

it
didn
t
change
say
maye
elon

condition
have
far
more
to

then
you

yell
at
him

he
would
not
even

a
little
different
but
in
a
nerdy
way
maye
say
it
didn
t
endear
him
to
his
peer
for
musk
these
pensive
moment
be
wonderful
at
five
and
six
he
have
found
a
way
to
block
out
the
world
and
dedicate
all
of
his
concentration
to
a
single
task
part
of
this
ability
stem
from
the
very
visual
way
in
which
musk
s
mind
work
he
could
see
image
in
his
mind
s
eye
with
a
clarity
and
detail
that
we
might
associate
today
with
an
engineering
draw
produce
by
computer
software
it
seem
as
though
the
part
of
the
brain
that
s
usually
reserve
for
visual
processing
the
part
that
be
use
to
process
image
come
in
from
my
eye
get
take
over
by
internal
thought
process
musk
say
i
can
t
do
this
as
much
now
because
there
be
so
many
thing
demand
my
attention
but
as
a
kid
it
happen
a
lot
that
large
part
of
your
brain
that

use
to

that

with
processing
the

produce
by
a

game
and
computational
chip
that
handle
general
purpose
task
and
mathematical
operation
over
time
musk
have
end
up
think
that
his
brain
have
the
equivalent
of
a
graphic
chip
it
allows
him
to
see
thing
out
in
the
world
replicate
them
in
his
mind
and
imagine
how
they
might
change
or
behave
when
interact
with
other
object
for
image
and
number
i
can
process
their
interrelationship
and
algorithmic
relationship
musk
say
acceleration
momentum
kinetic
energy
how
those
sort
of
thing
will
be
affected
by
object
come
through
very
vividly
the
most
strike
part
of
elon
s
character
as
a
young
boy
be
his
compulsion
to
read
from
a
very
young
age
he
seem
to
have
a
book
in
his
hand
at
all
time
it
be
not
unusual
for
him
to
read
ten
hour
a
day
say
kimbal
if
it
be
the
weekend
he
could
go
through
two
book
in
a
day
the
family
go
on
numerous
shopping
excursion
in
which
they
realize
mid
trip
that
elon
have
go
miss
maye
or
kimbal
would
pop
into
the
near
bookstore
and
find
elon
somewhere
near
the
back
sit
on
the
floor
and
reading
in
one
of
his
trancelike
state
as
elon
get
old
he
would
take
himself
to
the
bookstore
when
school
end
at
p
m
and
stay
there
until
about
p
m
when
his

return
home
from

he
plow
through

and
then

sometimes
they
kick
me
out
of

the

turn
him
into
a

factory
he
come
off
as
a

know
it
all
at
the
dinner
table
tosca
would
wonder
aloud
about
the
distance
from
earth
to
the

elon
would
spit
out
the
exact
measurement
at
perigee
and
apogee
if
we
have
a
question
tosca
would
always
say
just
ask
genius
boy
maye
say
we
could
ask
him
about
anything
he
just
remember
it
elon
cement
his
bookworm
reputation
through
his
clumsy
way
he
s
not
very
sporty
say
maye
maye
tell
the
story
of
elon
play
outside
one
night
with
his
sibling
and
cousin
when
one
of
them
complain
of
be
frighten
by
the
dark
elon
point
out
that
dark
be
merely
the
absence
of
light
which
do
little
to
reassure
the
scar
child
as
a
youngster
elon
s
constant
yearn
to
correct
people
and
his
abrasive
manner
put
off
other
kid
and
add
to
his
feeling
of
isolation
elon
genuinely
thought
that
people
would
be
happy
to
hear
about
the
flaw
in
their
think
kid

maye
they
would
say
elon
we

with
you
anymore
i
felt
very
sad
as
a
mother
because
i
think
he
want
friend
kimbal
and
tosca
would
bring
home
friend
and
elon
wouldn
t
and
he
would
want
to
play
with
them
but
he
be
awkward
you
know
maye
urge
kimbal
and
tosca
to
include
elon
they
respond
as
kid
will
but
mom
he
s
not
fun
as
he
get
old
however
elon
would
have
strong
affectionate
attachment
to
his
sibling
and
cousin
his
mother
s
sister
s
son
though
he
kept
to
himself
at

elon
have
an
outgo
nature
with
member
of
his

and
eventually
take

unfair
some

bought
into
this
idea
that
elon

that
his

more
with
the

male
of

by
the

take
any
situation
no
matter
how
good
it
be
and
make
it
bad
he
s
not
a
happy
man
i
don
t
know
fuck
i
don
t
know
how
someone
becomes
like
he
be
it
would
just
cause
too
much
trouble
to
tell
you
any
more
elon
and
justine
have
vowed
that
their
child
will
not
be
allow
to
meet
errol
when
elon
be
nearly
ten
year
old
he
saw
a
computer
for
the
first
time
at
the
sandton
city
mall
in
johannesburg
there
be
an
electronics
store
that
mostly
do
hi
fi
type
stuff
but
then
in
one
corner
they
start
stock
a
few
computer
musk
say
he
felt
awed
right
away
it
be
like
whoa
holy
shit
by
this
machine
that
could
be
programmed
to
do
a
person
s
bidding
i
have
to
have
that
and
then
hound
my
father
to
get
the
computer
musk
say
soon
he
own
a
commodore
vic
a
popular
home
machine
that
go
on
sale
in
elon
s
computer
arrive
with
five
kilobyte
of
memory
and
a
workbook
on
the
basic
program
language
it
be
suppose
to
take
like
six
month
to
get
through
all
the
lesson
elon
say
i
just
get
super
ocd
on
it
and
stayed
up
for
three
day
with
no
sleep
and
do
the
entire
thing
it
seem
like
the
most
super
compelling
thing
i
have
ever
see
despite
be
an
engineer
musk
s
father
be
something
of
a
luddite
and
dismissive
of
the
machine
elon
recount
that
he
say
it
be
just
for
game
and
that
you
d
never
be
able
to
do
real
engineering
on
it
i
just
say
whatever
while
bookish
and
into
his
new
computer
elon
quite
often
lead
kimbal
and
his
cousin
kaye
s
child
rus
lyndon
and
peter
rive
on
adventure
they
dabble
one
year
in
sell
easter
egg
door
to
door
in
the
neighborhood
the
egg
be
not
well
decorate
but
the
boy
still
marked
them
up
a
few
hundred
percent
for
their
wealthy
neighbor
elon
also
spearhead
their
work
with
homemade
explosive
and
rocket
south
africa
do
not
have
the
estes
rocket
kit
popular
among
hobbyist
so
elon
would
create
his
own
chemical
compound
and
put
them
inside
of
canister
it
be
remarkable
how
many
thing
you
can
get
to
explode
elon
say
saltpeter
sulfur
and
charcoal
be
the
basic
ingredient
for
gunpowder
and
then
if
you
combine
a
strong
acid
with
a
strong
alkaline
that
will
generally
release
a
lot
of
energy
granulate
chlorine
with
brake
fluid
that
s
quite
impressive
i
m
lucky
i
have
all
my
finger
when
not
handle
explosive
the
boy
put
on
layer
of
clothing
and
goggles
and
shot
each
other
with
pellet
gun
elon
and
kimbal
race
dirt
bike
against
each
other
in
sandlot
until
kimbal
flew
off
his
bike
one
day
and
hurtle
into
a
barbed
wire
fence
as
the
year
go
on
the
cousin
take
their
entrepreneurial
pursuit
more
seriously
even
attempt
at
one
point
to
start
a
video
arcade
without
any
parent
know
the
boy
picked
out
a
spot
for
their
arcade
get
a
lease
and
start
navigate
the
permit
process
for
their
business
eventually
they
have
to
get
someone
over
eighteen
to
sign
a
legal
document
and
neither
the
rives
father
nor
errol
would
oblige
it
would
take
a
couple
of
decade
but
elon
and
the
rives
would
eventually
go
into
business
together
the
boy
most
audacious
exploit
may
have
be
their
trip
between
pretoria
and
johannesburg
during
the
s
south
africa
could
be
a
terribly
violent
place
and
the
thirty
five
mile
train
trip
link
pretoria
and
johannesburg
stood
out
as
one
of
the
world
s
more
dangerous
ride
kimbal
count
the
train
journey
as
formative
experience
for
him
and
elon
south
africa
be
not
a
happy
go
lucky
place
and
that
have
an
impact
on
you
we
saw
some
really
rough
stuff
it
be
part
of
an
atypical
upbringing
just
this
insane
set
of
experience
that
change
how
you
view
risk
you
don
t
grow
up
think
get
a
job
be
the
hard
part
that
s
not
interest
enough
the
boy
range
in
age
from
about
thirteen
to
sixteen
and
chase
a
mix
of
party
and
geeky
exploit
in
johannesburg
during
one
jaunt
they
go
to
a
dungeon
dragon
tournament
that
be

which
require
someone
to
help
set
the
mood
for
a
contest
by
imagine
and
then
describe
a
scene
you
have
enter
a
room
and
there
be
a
chest
in
the
corner
what
will
you
do
you
open
the
chest
you
ve

detail
the
power
of
monster
and
other
character
under
elon
s
leadership
we
played
the
role
so
well
and
won
the
tournament
say
peter
rive
win
require
this
incredible
imagination
and
elon
really
set
the
tone
for
keep
people
captivate
and
inspire
the
elon
that
his
peer
encounter
at
school
be
far
less
inspirational
throughout
middle
and
high
school
elon
bounce
around
a
couple
of
institution
he
spent
the
equivalent
of
eighth
and
ninth
grade
at
bryanston
high
school
one
afternoon
elon
and

basically
hiding
from
this
gang
that
be
fuck
hunt
me
down
for
god
know
fuck
why
i
think
i
accidentally
bumped
this
guy
at
assembly
that
morning
and
he
d
take
some
huge
offense
at
that
the
boy
crept
up
behind
musk
kick
him
in
the
head
and
then
shove
him
down
the
stair
musk
tumble
down
the
entire
flight
and
a
handful
of
boy
pounce
on
him
some
of
them
kick
musk
in
the
side
and
the
ringleader
bashing
his
head
against
the
ground
they
be
a
bunch
of
fuck
psycho
musk
say
i
black
out
kimbal
watch
in
horror
and
fear
for
elon
s
life
he
rush
down
the
stair
to
find
elon
s
face
bloody
and
swollen
he
look
like
someone
who
have
just
be
in
the
boxing
ring
kimbal
say
elon
then
go
to
the
hospital
it
be
about
a
week
before
i
could
get
back
to
school
musk
say
during
a
news
conference
in
elon
disclose
that
he
d
have
a
nose
job
to
deal
with
the
linger
effect
of
this
beating
for
three
or
four
year
musk
endure
relentless
hound
at
the
hand
of
these
bully
they
go
so
far
as
to
beat
up
a
boy
that
musk
consider
his
best
friend
until
the
child
agree
to
stop
hang
out
with
musk
moreover
they
get
him
they
get
my
best
fuck
friend
to
lure
me
out
of
hiding
so
they
could
beat
me
up
musk
say
and
that
fuck
hurt
while
tell
this
part
of
the
story
musk
s
eye
well
up
and
his
voice
quiver
for
some
reason
they
decide
that
i
be
it
and
they
be
go
to
go
after
me
nonstop
that
s
what
make
grow
up
difficult
for
a
number
of
year
there
be
no
respite
you
get
chase
around
by
gang
at
school
who
try
to
beat
the
shit
out
of
me
and
then
i
d
come
home
and
it
would
just
be
awful
there
as
well
it
be
just
like
nonstop
horrible
musk
spent
the
latter
stage
of
his
high
school
career
at
pretoria
boy
high
school
where
a
growth
spurt
and
the
generally
well
behavior
of
the
student
make
life
more
bearable
while
a
public
school
by
definition
pretoria
boy
have
function
more
like
a
private
school
for
the
last
hundred
year
it
s
the
place
you
send
a
young
man
to
get
him
ready
to
attend
oxford
or
cambridge
the
boy
from
musk
s
class
remember
him
as
a
likable
quiet
unspectacular
student
there
be
four
or
five
boy
that
be
consider
the
very
brightest
say
deon
prinsloo
who
sat
behind
elon
in
some
class
elon
be
not
one
of
them
such
comment
be
echoed
by
a
half
dozen
boy
who
also
note
that
musk
s
lack
of
interest
in
sport
left
him
isolated
in
the
midst
of
an
athletics
obsess
culture
honestly
there
be
just
no
sign
that
he
be
go
to
be
a
billionaire
say
gideon
fourie
another
classmate
he
be
never
in
a
leadership
position
at
school
i
be
rather
surprised
to
see
what
have
happen
to
him
while
musk
didn
t
have
any
close
friend
at
school
his
eccentric
interest
do
leave
an
impression
one
boy
ted
wood
remember
musk
bring
model
rocket
to
school
and
blasting
them
off
during
break
this
be
not
the
only
hint
of
his
aspiration
during
a
science
class
debate
elon
gain
attention
for
rail
against
fossil
fuel
in
favor
of
solar
power
an
almost
sacrilegious
stance
in
a
country
devote
to
mining
the
earth
s
natural
resource
he
always
have
firm
view
on
thing
say
wood
terency
beney
a
classmate
who
stayed
in
touch
with
elon
over
the
year
claimed
that
musk
have
start
fantasize
about
colonize
other
planet
in
high
school
as
well
in
another
nod
to
the
future
elon
and
kimbal
be
chat
during
a
class
break
outdoors
when
wood
interrupt
them
and
ask
what
they
be
go
on
about
they
say
we
be
talk
about
whether
there
be
a
need
for
branch
banking
in
the
financial
industry
and
whether
we
will
move
to
paperless
banking
i
remember
think
that
be
such
an
absurd
comment
to
make
i
say
yeah
that
s
great
while
musk
might
not
have
be
among
the
academic
elite
in
his
class
he
be
among
a
handful
of
student
with
the
grade
and
self
profess
interest
to
be
select
for
an
experimental
computer
program
student
be
plucked
out
of
a
number
of
school
and
brought
together
to
learn
the
basic
cobol
and
pascal
program
language
musk
continued
to
augment
these
technological
leaning
with
his
love
of
science
fiction
and
fantasy
and
try
his
hand
at
write
story
that
involve
dragon
and
supernatural
being
i
want
to
write
something
like
lord
of
the
ring
he
say
maye
view
these
high
school
year
through
a
mother
s
eye
and
recount
plenty
of
tale
of
musk
perform
spectacular
academic
feat
the
video
game
he
write
she
say
impressed
much
old
more
experienced
techie
he
ace
math
exam
well
beyond
his
year
and
he
have
that
incredible
memory
the
only
reason
he
do
not
outrank
the
other
boy
be
a
lack
of
interest
in
the
work
prescribed
by
the
school
as
musk
saw
it
i
just
look
at
it
as
what
grade
do
i
need
to
get
where
i
want
to
go
there
be
compulsory
subject
like
afrikaans
and
i
just
didn
t
see
the
point
of
learn
that
it
seem
ridiculous
i
d
get
a
passing
grade
and
that
be
fine
thing
like
physic
and
computer
i
get
the
high
grade
you
can
get
in
those
there
need
to
be
a
reason
for
a
grade
i
d
rather
play
video
game
write
software
and
read
book
than
try
and
get
an
a
if
there
s
no
point
in
get
an
a
i
can
remember
fail
subject
in
like
fourth
and
fifth
grade
then
my
mother
s
boyfriend
told
me
i
d
be
held
back
if
i
didn
t
pas
i
didn
t
actually
know
you
have
to
pas
the
subject
to
move
to
the
next
grade
i
get
the
best
grade
in
class
after
that
at
seventeen
musk
left
south
africa
for
canada
he
have
recount
this
journey
quite
often
in
the
press
and
typically
lean
on
two
description
of
the
motivation
for
his
flight
the
short
version
be
that
musk
want
to
get
to
the
united
state
as
quickly
as
possible
and
could
use
canada
as
a
pit
stop
via
his
canadian
ancestry
the
second
go
to
story
that
musk
relies
on
have
more
of
a
social
conscience
south
africa
require
military
service
at
the
time
musk
want
to
avoid
join
the
military
he
have
say
because
it
would

themselves
well
and
be
polite
elon
though
clearly
come
off
as
the
geekier
more
awkward
counterpoint
to
the
charismatic
personable

i
become
more
impressed
and
fascinate
as
i
talk
to

about
fifteen
other

christie
before
but
he
go
right
up
to
her
and
lead
her
to
a
couch
then
i
believe
the
second
sentence
out
of
his
mouth
be
i
think
a
lot
about
electric
car
christie
say
and
then
he
turn
to
me
and
say
do
you
think
about
electric
car
the
conversation
left
christie
who
be
now
a
science
writer
with
the
distinct
impression
that
musk
be
handsome
affable
and
a
tremendous
nerd
for
whatever
reason
i
be
so
struck
by
that
moment
on
the
sofa
she
say
you
could
tell
that
this
person
be
very
different
he
captivate
me
in
that
way
with
her
angular
feature
and
blond
hair
christie
fit
musk
s
type
and
the
two
stayed
in
touch
during
musk
s
time
in
canada
they
never
really
date
but
christie
found
musk
interest
enough
to
have
lengthy
conversation
with
him
on
the
phone
one
night
he
told
me
if
there
be
a
way
that
i
could
not
eat
so
i
could
work
more
i
would
not
eat
i
wish
there
be
a
way
to
get
nutrient
without
sit
down
for
a
meal
the
enormity
of
his
work
ethic
at
that
age
and
his
intensity
jumped
out
it
seem
like
one
of
the
more
unusual
thing
i
have
ever

elon
could
lose

also
relish
their
loner
lifestyle
we
be

and
not
feel

farooq
say
we
can
think
to
ourselves
and
not
feel
socially
weird
about
it
musk
be
more
ambitious
in

than
he
d
be
in
high
school
he
study
business
compete
in
public
speak
contest
and
begin
to
display
the
brand
of
intensity
and
competitiveness
that
mark
his
behavior
today
after
one
economics
exam
musk
farooq
and
some
other
student
in
class
come
back
to
the
dorm
and
begin
compare
note
to
try
to
ascertain
how
well
they
do
on
the
test
it
soon
become
clear
that
musk
have
a
firmer
grasp
on
the
material
than
anyone
else
this
be
a
group
of
fairly
high
achiever
and
elon
stood
way
outside
of
the
bell
curve
farooq
say
musk
s
intensity
have
continued
to
be
a
constant
in
their
long
relationship
when
elon
get
into
something
he
develops
just
this
different
level
of
interest
in
it
than
other
people
that
be
what
differentiates
elon
from
the
rest
of
humanity
in
have
spent
two
year
at
queen
s
musk
transfer
to
the
university
of
pennsylvania
on
a
scholarship
musk
saw
the
ivy
league
school
as
possibly
opening
some
additional
door
and
go
off
in
pursuit
of
dual
degree
first
an
economics
degree
from
the
wharton
school
and

become
a

and
maintain
a
long
distance
relationship
with
musk
now
and
again
she
would
visit
him
and
the
two
would
sometimes
head
off
to
new
york
for
a
romantic
weekend
musk
blossom
even
more
at
penn
and
really
start
to
feel
comfortable
while
hang
out
with
his
fellow
physic
student
at
penn
he
met
people
that
thought
like
him
maye
say
there
be
some
nerd
there
he
so
enjoy
them
i
remember
go

lunch
with
them

a
plus
b
equal
pi
square
or
whatever
they
would
laugh
out
loud
it
be
cool
to
see
him
so
happy
once
again
however
musk
do
not
make
many
friend
among
the
broader
school
body
it
s
difficult
to
find
former
student
who
remember
him

there
at
all
but
he
do
make
one
very

be
to
this

he
talk
musk
into

as
the
weekend
approach
ressi

and
other
thing
come
friday

with
a
bit
of

he
write
the

will
come
out
tomorrow
little
orphan
annie
on
the

go
on
to
predict
a
rise
in

the

receive
a
on
what
his

deem
a
very

talk
about
take
research
document
and
book
and
electronically
scan
them
perform
optical
character
recognition
and
put
all
of
the
information
in
a

much
like
a
mix
between
today
s
google
book

scholar
and
a
third

dwell
on
another
of

favorite
topic
ultracapacitors
in

significant
amount
of
electrical
energy
since
the
development
of
the

furthermore
because
the
ultracapacitor
retains
the
basic
property
of
a
capacitor
it
can
deliver
its
energy
over

for

the
work
of
a
logician
move
from
one
point
to
the
next
with
precision
what
truly
stood
out
though

musk
s
ability
to
master
difficult
physic
concept
in
the
midst
of
actual
business
plan
even
then
he
show
an
unusual
knack
for
be
able
to
perceive
a
path
from
a
scientific
advance
to
a
for
profit
enterprise
as
musk
begin
to
think
more
seriously
about
what
he
would
do
after
college
he
briefly
consider
get
into
the
videogame
business
he
d
be
obsess
with
video
game
since
his
childhood
and
have
held
a
game
internship
but
he
come
to
see
them
as
not
quite
grand
enough
a
pursuit
i
really
like
computer
game
but
then
if
i
make
really
great
computer
game
how
much
effect
would
that
have
on
the
world
he
say
it
wouldn
t
have
a
big
effect
even
though
i
have
an
intrinsic
love
of
video
game
i
couldn
t
bring
myself
to
do
that
as
a
career
in
interview
musk
often
make
sure
that
people
know
he
have
some
truly
big
idea
on
his
mind
during
this
period
of
his
life
as
he
tell
it
he
would
daydream
at
queen
s
and
penn
and
usually
end
up
with
the
same
conclusion
he
view
the
internet
renewable
energy
and
space
as
the
three
area
that
would
undergo
significant
change
in
the
year
to
come
and
as
the
market
where
he
could
make
a
big
impact
he
vowed
to
pursue
project
in
all
three
i
told
all
my
ex
girlfriend
and
my
ex
wife
about
these
idea
he
say
it
probably
sound
like
super
crazy
talk
musk
s
insistence
on
explain
the
early
origin
of
his
passion
for
electric
car
solar
energy
and
rocket
can
come
off
as
insecure
it
feel
as
if
musk
be
try
to
shape
his
life
story
in
a
force
way
but
for
musk
the
distinction
between
stumble
into
something
and
have
intent
be
important
musk
have
long
want
the
world
to
know
that
he
s
different
from
the
run
of
the
mill
entrepreneur
in
silicon
valley
he
wasn
t
just
sniff
out
trend
and
he
wasn
t
consume
by
the
idea
of
get
rich
he
s
be
in
pursuit
of
a
master
plan
all
along
i
really
be
think
about
this
stuff
in
college
he
say
it
be
not
some
invent
story
after
the
fact
i
don
t
want
to
seem
like
a
johnny
come
lately
or
that
i
m
chase
a
fad
or
just
be
opportunistic
i
m
not
an
investor
i
like
to
make
technology
real
that
i
think
be
important
for
the
future
and
useful
in
some
sort
of
way

on
the
web
from
california
to
colorado
wyoming
south
dakota
and
illinois
they
take
turn
drive
brainstorming
and
talk
shit
before
head
back
east
to
get
musk
to
school
that
fall
the
best
idea
to
arise
from
the
journey
be
an
online
network
for
doctor
this
wasn
t
meant
to
be
something
as
ambitious
as
electronic
health
record
but
more
of
a
system
for
physician
to
exchange
information
and
collaborate
it
seem
like
the
medical
industry
be
one
that
could
be
disrupt
kimbal
say
i
go
to
work
on
a
business
plan
and
the
sale
and
marketing
side
of
it
later
but
it
didn
t
fly
we
didn
t
love
it
musk
have
spent
the
earlier
part
of
that
summer
in
silicon
valley
hold
down
a
pair
of
internship
by
day
he
work
at
pinnacle
research
institute
base
in
los
gatos
pinnacle
be
a
much
ballyhooed
start
up
with
a
team
of
scientist
explore
way
in
which
ultracapacitors
could
be
use
as
a
revolutionary
fuel
source
in
electric
and
hybrid
vehicle
the
work
also
veer
at
least
conceptually
into
more
bizarre
territory
musk
could
talk
at
length
about
how
ultracapacitors
might
be
use
to
build
laser
base
sidearms
in
the
tradition
of
star
war
and
just
about
any
other
futuristic
film
the
laser
gun
would
release
round
of
enormous
energy
and
then
the
shooter
would
replace
an
ultracapacitor
at
the
base
of
the
gun
much
like
swap
out
a
clip
of
bullet
and
start
blasting
away
again
ultracapacitors
also
look
promising
as
the
power
supply
for
missile
they
be
more
resilient
than
battery
under
the
mechanical
stress
of
a
launch
and
would
hold
a
more
consistent
charge
over
long
period
of
time
musk
fell
in
love
with
the
work
at
pinnacle
and
begin
use
it
as
the
basis
for
some
of
his
business
plan
experiment
at
penn
and
for
his
industrialist
fantasy
in
the
evening
musk
head
to
rocket
science
game
a
start
up
base
in
palo
alto
that
want
to
create
the
most
advanced
video
game
ever
make
by
move
them
off
cartridge
and
onto
cd
that
could
hold
more
information
the
cd
would
in
theory
allow
them
to
bring
hollywood
style
storytelling
and
production
quality
to
the
game
a
team
of
budding
all
star
who
be
a
mix
of
engineer
and
film
people
be
assemble
to
pull
off
the
work
tony
fadell
who
would
later
drive
much
of
the
development
of
both
the
ipod
and
iphone
at
apple
work
at
rocket
science
as
do
the
guy
who
developed
the
quicktime
multimedia
software
for
apple
they
also
have
people
who
work
on
the
original
star
war
effect
at
industrial
light
magic
and
some
who
do
game
at
lucasarts
entertainment
rocket
science
give
musk
a
flavor
for
what
silicon
valley
have
to
offer
both
from
a
talent
and
culture
perspective
there
be
people
work
at
the
office
twenty
four
hour
a
day
and
they
didn
t
think
it
at
all
odd
that
musk
would
turn
up
around
p
m
every
even
to
start
his
second
job
we
brought
him
in
to
write
some
very
menial
low
level
code
say
peter
barrett
an
australian
engineer
who
help
start
the
company
he
be
completely
unflappable
after
a
short
while
i
don
t
think
anyone
be
give
him
any
direction
and
he
end
up
make
what
he
want
to
make
specifically
musk
have
be
ask
to
write
the
driver
that
would
let
joystick
and
mouse
communicate
with
various
computer
and
game
driver
be
the
same
type
of
annoy
file
that
you
have
to
install
to
get
a
printer
or
camera
work
with
a
home
computer
true
grunt
work
a
self
taught
programmer
musk
fancy
himself
quite
good
at
cod
and
assign
himself
to
more
ambitious
job
i
be
basically
try
to
figure
out
how
you
could
multitask
stuff
so
you
could
read
video
from
a
cd
while
run
a
game
at
the
same
time
musk
say
at
the
time
you
could
do
one
or
the
other
it
be
this
complicate
bit
of
assembly
program
complicate
indeed
musk
have
to
issue
command
that
spoke
directly
to
a
computer
s
main
microprocessor
and
fiddle
with
the
most
basic
function
that
make
the
machine
work
bruce
leak
the
former
lead
engineer
behind
apple
s
quicktime
have
overseen
the
hire
of
musk
and
marvel
at
his
ability
to
pull
all
nighters
he
have
boundless
energy
leak
say
kid
these
day
have
no
idea
about
hardware
or
how
stuff
work
but
he
have
a
pc
hacker
background
and
be
not
afraid
to
just
go
figure
thing
out
musk
found
in
silicon
valley
a
wealth
of
the
opportunity
he
d
be
seek
and
a
place
equal
to
his
ambition
he
would
return
two
summer
in
a
row
and
then
bolt
west
permanently
after
graduate
with
dual
degree
from
penn
he
initially
intend
to
pursue
a
doctorate
in
material
science
and
physic
at
stanford
and
to
advance
the
work
he
d
do
at
pinnacle
on
ultracapacitors
as
the
story
go
musk
drop
out
of
stanford
after
two
day
find
the
internet
s
call
irresistible
he
talk
kimbal
into
move
to
silicon
valley
as
well
so
they
could
conquer
the
web
together
the
first
inkling
of
a
viable
internet
business
have
come
to
musk
during
his
internship
a
salesperson
from
the
yellow
page
have
come
into
one
of
the
start
up
office
he
try
to
sell
the
idea
of
an
online
listing
to
complement
the
regular
listing
a
company
would
have
in
the
big
fat
yellow
page
book
the
salesman
struggle
with
his
pitch
and
clearly
have
little
grasp
of
what
the
internet
actually
be
or
how
someone
would
find
a
business
on
it
the
flimsy
pitch
get
musk
think
and
he
reach
out
to
kimbal
talk
up
the
idea
of
help
business
get
online
for
the
first
time
elon
say
these
guy
don
t
know
what
they
be
talk
about
maybe
this
be
something
we
can
do
kimbal
say
this
be
and
the
brother
be
about
to
form
global
link
information
network
a
start
up
that
would
eventually
be
rename
zip
for
detail
on
the
controversy
surround
zip
s
found
and
musk
s
academic
record
see
appendix
the
zip
idea
be
ingenious
few
small
business
in
understood
the
ramification
of
the
internet
they
have
little
idea
how
to
get
on
it
and
didn
t
really
see
the
value
in
create
a
website
for
their
business
or
even
in
have
a
yellow
page
like
listing
online
musk
and
his
brother
hop
to
convince
restaurant
clothing
shop
hairdresser
and
the
like
that
the
time
have
come
for
them
to
make
their
presence
know
to
the
web
surf
public
zip
would
create
a
searchable
directory
of
business
and
tie
this
into
map
musk
often
explain
the
concept
through
pizza
say
that
everyone
deserve
the
right
to
know
the
location
of
their
closest
pizza
parlor
and
the
turn
by
turn
direction
to
get
there
this
may
seem
obvious
today
think
yelp
meet
google
map
but
back
then
not
even
stoner
have
dream
up
such
a
service
the
musk
brother
brought
zip
to
life
at
sherman
avenue
in
palo
alto
they
rent
a
studio
apartment
size
office
twenty
foot
by
thirty
foot
and
acquire
some
basic
furniture
the
three
story
building
have
its
quirk
there
be
no
elevator
and
the
toilet
often
back
up
it
be
literally
a
shitty
place
to
work
say
an
early
employee
to
get
a
fast
internet
connection
musk
struck
a
deal
with
ray
girouard
an
entrepreneur
who
ran
an
internet
service
provider
operation
from
the
floor
below
the
zip
office
accord
to
girouard
musk
drill
a
hole
in
the
drywall
near
the
zip
door
and
then
strung
an
ethernet
cable
down
the
stairwell
to
the
isp
they
be
slow
to
pay
a
couple
of
time
but
never
stiffed
me
on
the
bill
girouard
say
musk
do
all
of
the
original
cod
behind
the
service
himself
while
the
more
amiable
kimbal
look
to
ramp
up
the
door
to
door
sale
operation
musk
have
acquire
a
cheap
license
to
a
database
of
business
listing
in
the
bay
area
that
would
give
a
business
s
name
and
its
address
he
then
contact
navteq
a
company
that
have
spent
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
to
create
digital
map
and
direction
that
could
be
use
in
early
gps
navigation
style
device
and
struck
a
masterful
bargain
we
call
them
up
and
they
give
us
the
technology
for
free
say
kimbal
musk
merge
the
two
database
together
to
get
a
rudimentary
system
up
and
run
over
time
zip
s
engineer
have
to
augment
this
initial
data
haul
with
more
map
to
cover
area
outside
of
major
metropolitan
area
and
to
build
custom
turn
by

that
would
look
good
and
work
well
on
a
home
computer
errol
musk
give
his

the

we
owe
him
a
lot

kimbal
in
early
zip
underwent
a
massive
change
the
venture
capital
firm
mohr
davidow
venture
have
caught
wind
of
a
couple
of
south
african
boy
try
to
make
a
yellow
page
for
the
internet
and
met
with
the
brother
musk
while
raw
in
his
presentation
skill
pitch
the
company
well
enough
and
the
investor
come
away
impressed
with
his
energy
mohr
davidow
invest
million
into
the
company
with
these
fund
in
hand
the
company
officially
change
its
name
from
global
link
to
zip
the
idea
be
zip
to
here
zip
to
there
move
to
a
large
office
at
cambridge
avenue
in
palo
alto
and
begin
hire
talented
engineer
zip
also
shift
its
business
strategy
at
the
time
the
company
have
built
one
of
the
best
direction
system
on
the
web
zip
would
advance
this
technology
and
take
it
from
focus
just
on
the
bay
area
to
have
a
national
scope
the
company
s
main
focus
however
would
be
an
altogether
new
play
instead
of
sell
its
service
door
to
door
zip
would
create
a
software
package
that
could
be
sell
to
newspaper
which
would
in
turn
build
their
own
directory
for
real
estate
auto
dealer
and
classified
the
newspaper
be
late
understand
how
the
internet
would
impact
their
business
and
zip
s
software
would
give
them
a
quick
way
of
get
online
without
need
to
develop
all
their
own
technology
from
scratch
for
its
part
zip
could
chase
big
prey
and
get
a
cut
of
a
nationwide
network
of
listing
this
transition
of
the
business
model
and
the
company
s
makeup
would
be
a
seminal
moment
in
musk
s
life
the
venture
capitalist
push
musk
into
the
role
of
chief
technology
officer

where
he
steer
a
number
of

start
ups
zip
s
investor
saw
him
as
experienced
and
clue
in
to
the
web
while
musk
agree
to
the
arrangement
he
come
to
resent
give
up
control
of
zip
probably
the
big
regret
the
whole
time
i
work
with
him
be
that
he
have
make
a
deal
with
the
devil
with
mohr
davidow
say
jim
ambras
the
vice
president
of

at

elon
didn
t

any
operational

beloved
by

the
flashiest

of
its
day
and
have
hoard
the

and
yet
ambras
use
the
promise
of
internet
rich
to
poach
a
team
of
sgi
s
smartest
engineer
over
to
zip
our
attorney
get
a
letter
from
sgi
say
that
we
be
cherry
pick
the
very
best
guy
ambras
say
elon
thought
that
be
fantastic
while
musk
have
excel
as
a
self
taught
coder
his
skill
weren
t
nearly
as
polished
as
those
of
the
new
hire
they
take
one
look
at
zip
s
code
and
begin
rewrite
the
vast
majority
of
the
software
musk
bristle
at
some
of
their
change
but
the
computer
scientist
need
just
a
fraction
of
the
line
of
code
that
musk
use
to
get
their
job
do
they
have
a
knack
for
divide
software
project
into
chunk
that
could
be
alter
and
refine
whereas
musk
fell
into
the
classic
self
taught
coder
trap
of
write
what
developer
call
hairball
big
monolithic
hunk
of
code
that
could
go
berserk
for
mysterious
reason
the
engineer
also
brought
a
more
refine
work
structure
and
realistic
deadline
to
the
engineering
group
this
be
a
welcome
change
from
musk
s
approach
which
have
be
to
set
overly
optimistic
deadline
and
then
try
to
get
engineer
to
work
nonstop
for
day
on
end
to
meet
the
goal
if
you
ask
elon
how
long
it
would
take
to
do
something
there
be
never
anything
in
his
mind
that
would
take
more
than
an
hour
ambras
say
we
come
to
interpret
an
hour
as
really
take
a
day
or
two
and
if
elon
ever
do
say
something
would
take
a
day
we
allow
for
a
week
or
two
week
start
zip
and
watch
it
grow
imbue

with
self
confidence
terence
beney
one
of
musk
s
high
school
friend
come
to
california
for
a
visit
and
notice
the
change
in
musk
s
character
right
away
he
watch
musk
confront
a
nasty
landlord
who
have
be
give
his
mother
who
be
rent
an
apartment
in
town
a
hard
time
he
say
if
you
re
go
to
bully
someone
bully
me
it
be
startle
to
see
him
take
over
the
situation
the
last
time
i
have
see
him
he
be
this
geeky
awkward
kid
who
would
sometimes
lose
his
temper
he
be
the
kid
you
would
pick
on
to
get
a
response
now
he
be
confident
and
in
control
musk
also
begin
consciously
try
to
manage
his
criticism
of
others
elon
be
not
someone
who
would
say
i
feel
you
i
see
your
point
of
view
say
justine
because
he
doesn
t
have
that
i
feel
you
dimension
there
be
thing
that
seem
obvious
to
other
people
that
weren
t
that
obvious
to
him
he
have
to
learn
that
a
twenty
something
year
old
shouldn
t
really
shoot
down
the
plan
of
old
senior
people
and
point
out
everything
wrong
with
them
he
learn
to
modify
his
behavior
in
certain
way
i
just
think
he
come
at
the
world
through
strategy
and
intellect
the
personality
tweak
work
with
vary
degree
of
success
musk
still
tend
to
drive
the
young
engineer
mad
with
his
work
demand
and
blunt
criticism
i
remember
be
in
a
meeting
once
brainstorming
about
a
new
product
a
new
car
site
say
doris
downes
the
creative
director
at
zip
someone
complain
about
a
technical
change
that
we
want
be
impossible
elon
turn
and
say
i
don
t
really
give
a
damn
what
you
think
and
walk
out
of
the
meeting
for
elon
the
word
no
do
not
exist
and
he
expect
that
attitude
from
everyone
around
him
periodically
musk
let
loose
on
the
more
senior
executive
as
well
you
would
see
people
come
out
of
the
meeting
with
this
disgust
look
on
their
face
mohr
the
salesman
say
you
don
t
get
to
where
elon
be
now
by
always
be
a
nice
guy
and
he
be
just
so
driven
and
sure
of
himself
as
musk
try
to
come
to
term
with
the
change
the
investor
have
inflict
on
zip
he
do
enjoy
some
of
the
perk
of
have
big
money
backing
the
financier
help
the
musk
brother
with
their
visa
they
also
give
them
each
to
buy

kimbal
have
trade
in
their
dilapidate
bmw
for
a

that
they
spray
paint
with
polka

kimbal
upgraded
from

kept
break

and
proceed
to

have
turn
purple
and
sweat
pour
out
of
him
and
he
make
it
to

back
to
that
ride
he
wasn
t
close
to
be
in
the
condition
need
for
it
ambras
say
anyone
else
would
have
quit
or

up
their

as
i
watch
him
climb
that
final
hundred
foot
with

up
musk
continued
to
be
a
ball
of
energy
around
the

as
well
ahead
of
visit
by
venture
capitalist
and
other

musk
would
rally
the

and
instruct
them
all
to

the

the

player
to
the

he
believe
the

could
offer

directly
to

encourage
the
purchase
of
the
domain
name
city

with
the
hope
of
turn
it
into
a

destination
but
the
lure
of
the
medium
company
money
kept
sorkin
and
the
board
on
a
conservative
path
and
they
decide
to
worry
about
a
consumer
push
down
the
road
in
april
zip
announce

it

with
its
main
competitor

in
a

value
at
around
million
the
new
company
would
retain
the

name
while
sorkin
would
head
up
the
venture
on

the

the
talented
engineer
at

the

have
be
announce
in
the

and
seem
inevitable
the
opinion
on
what
happen
next
vary
greatly
the
logistics
of
the
situation
require
the
two
company
to
go
over
each
other

book
and
to
figure
out
which
employee
would
be
fire
to
avoid
a
duplication
of
role
this
process
raise
some
question
about
how
frank
citysearch
have
be
with
its
financials
and
rankle
some
executive
at
zip
who
could
see
their
position
be
diminish
or
erase
altogether
at
the
new
company
one
faction
inside
zip
argue
that
the

should
be
abandon
while
sorkin
demand
that
it
go
through
musk
who
have
be
an
early
advocate
of
the

turn
against
it
in
may
the
two
company
cancel
the
merger
and
the

pounce
make
a
big
deal
of
the
chaotic
bust

musk
urge

decline

atrocious
and
later
point
to
the

s
reaction
and
musk
s
demotion
as
evidence
that
they

musk
still

and
worried
that
they
might
not
be
able
to
outrun
the

then
in
february
the
pc
maker
compaq
computer
suddenly
offer
to
pay
million
in
cash
for
zip
it
be
like

from
heaven
say
ed
ho
a
former
zip
executive
zip

board
accepted
the
offer
and
the
company
rent
out
a

and
threw
a
huge
party
mohr
davidow
have
make
back
twenty
time
its
original

and
musk
and
kimbal
have
come
away
with
million
and
million
respectively
musk
never
entertain
the
idea
of
stick
around
at
compaq
as
soon
as
it
be
clear
the
company
would
be
sell
elon
be
on
to
his
next
project
proudian
say
from
that
point
on
musk
would
fight
to
maintain
control
of
his
company
and
stay
ceo
we
be
overwhelmed
and
just
thought
these
guy
must
know
what
they
re
do
kimbal
say
but
they
didn
t
there
be
no
vision
once
they
take
over
they
be
investor
and
we
get
on
well
with
them
but
the
vision
have
just
disappear
from
the
company
year
later
after
he
have
time
to
reflect
on
the
zip
situation
musk
realize
that
he
could
have
handle
some
of
the
situation
with
employee
well
i
have
never
really
run
a
team
of
any
sort
before
musk
say
i
d
never
be
a
sport
captain
or
a
captain
of
anything
or
manage
a
single
person
i
have
to
think
okay
what
be
the
thing
that
affect
how
a
team
function
the
first
obvious
assumption
would
be
that
other
people
will
behave
like
you
but
that
s
not
true
even
if
they
would
like
to
behave
like
you
they
don
t
necessarily
have
all
the
assumption
or
information
that
you
have
in
your
mind
so
if
i
know
a
certain
set
of
thing
and
i
talk
to
a
replica
of
myself
but
only
communicate
half
the
information
you
can
t
expect
that
the
replica
would
come
to
the
same
conclusion
you
have
to
put
yourself
in
a
position
where
you
say
well
how
would
this
sound
to
them
know
what
they
know
employee
at
zip
would
go
home
at
night
come
back
and
find
that
musk
have
change
their
work
without
talk
to
them
and
musk
s
confrontational
style
do
more
harm
than
good
yeah
we
have
some
very
good
software
engineer
at
zip
but
i
mean
i
could
code
way
well
than
them
and
i
d
just
go
in
and
fix
their
fuck
code
musk
say
i
would
be
frustrate
wait
for
their
stuff
so
i
m
go
to
go
and
fix
your
code
and
now
it
run
five
time
faster
you
idiot
there
be
one
guy
who
write
a
quantum
mechanic
equation
a
quantum
probability
on
the
board
and
he
get
it
wrong
i
m
like
how
can
you
write
that
then
i
correct
it
for
him
he
hat
me
after
that
eventually
i
realize
okay
i
might
have
fix
that
thing
but
now
i
ve
make
the
person
unproductive
it
just
wasn
t
a
good
way
to
go
about
thing
musk
the
dot
com
striver
have
be
both
lucky
and
good
he
have
a
decent
idea
turn
it
into
a
real
service
and
come
out
of
the
dot
com
tumult
with
cash
in
his
pocket
which
be
well
than
what
many
of
his
compatriot
could
say
the
process
have
be
painful
musk
have
yearn
to
be
a
leader
but
the
people
around
him
struggle
to
see
how
musk
as
the
ceo
could
work
as
far
as
musk
be
concerned
they
be
all
wrong
and
he
set
out
to
prove
his
point
with
what
would
end
up
be
even
more
dramatic

i
calculate
the

it
be
something

to
mess
with
it
again
i
try
to
tell
them
that
s
not
the
point
musk
say
the
point
be
that
it
s
fuck
back
by
uncle
sam
it
doesn
t
matter
what
the
south
american
do
you
cannot
lose
unless
you
think
the
u
s
treasury
be
go
to
default
but
they
still
didn
t
do
it
and
i
be
stun
later
in
life
as
i
compete
against
the
bank
i
would
think
back
to
this
moment
and
it
give
me
confidence
all
the
banker
do
be
copy
what
everyone
else
do
if
everyone
else
ran
off
a
bloody
cliff
they
d
run
right
off
a
cliff
with
them
if
there
be
a
giant
pile
of
gold
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
nobody
be
pick
it
up
they
wouldn
t
pick
it
up
either
in
the
year
that
follow
musk
consider
start
an
internet
bank
and
discuss
it
openly
during
his
internship
at
pinnacle
research
in
the
youthful
musk
lecture
the
scientist
about
the
inevitable
transition
come
in
finance
toward
online
system
but
they
try
to
talk
him
down
say
that
it
would
take
age
for
web
security
to
be
good
enough
to
win
over
consumer
musk
though
remain
convince
that
the
finance
industry
could
do
with
a
major
upgrade
and
that
he
could
have
a
big
influence
on
banking
with
a
relatively
small
investment
money
be
low
bandwidth
he
say
during
a
speech
at
stanford
university
in
to
describe
his
think
you
don
t
need
some
sort
of
big
infrastructure
improvement
to
do
thing
with
it
it
s
really
just
an
entry
in
a
database
the
actual
plan
that
musk
concoct
be
beyond
grandiose
as
the
researcher
at
pinnacle
have
point
out
people
be
barely
comfortable
buying
book
online
they
might
take
their
chance
enter
a
credit
card
number
but
expose
just
their
bank
account
to
the
web
be
out
of
the
question
to
many
pah
so
what
musk
want
to
build
a
full
service
financial
institution
online
a
company
that
would
have
saving
and
check
account
as
well
as
brokerage
service
and
insurance
the
technology
to
build
such
a
service
be
possible
but
navigate
the
regulatory
hell
of

an
intractable

or
put
up
a

listing
it
be

there
would
be
real
repercussion
if
the
service
do
not
work
as

undaunted
musk
kick
this
new

the

about

i

those
be
just
a
large
number
of
ben

next
about
the
awesomeness
of
his
life
there
it
be
gentleman
the
fast
car
in
the

and
then
about
his
prodigious
ambition
i
could
go
and
buy
one
of
the
island
in
the
bahamas
and
turn
it
into
my
personal
fiefdom
but
i
be
much
more
interested
in
try

build
and
create
a
new
company
the
camera
crew
follow
musk
to
the

where
his
cocksure
delivery
lead
to
another
round
of
cringe
worthy
statement
i
do
not
fit
the
picture
of
a

raise
fifty

a
matter
of
make
a

the

there
i

could
absolutely
be
a
multibillion

bonanza
musk
purchase
the
mclaren
from
a

in

snatch
the

from
ralph
lauren
who
have
also
inquire
about
buying
it
even
very
wealthy
people
like
lauren
would
tend
to
reserve
something
like
a
mclaren
for
special
event
or
the
occasional
sunday
drive
not
musk
he
drove
it

around

and
park
it
on
the

horrify
to

a

this

george

of

he
show
me
the

with

turn
to
a

in

say
watch
this
he
floor
the

do
a
lane
change
spun
out
and
hit
an

damage
musk
again
turn
to
his

and
say
the
funny
part
be
it
wasn
t
insured
the
two
of
them
then
thumbed
a
ride
to
the
venture

to
his
credit
musk
do
not
fully
buy

to
this
playboy
persona
he
actually
plow
the
majority
of
the
money
he
make
from
zip
into
x

there
be
practical
reason
for
this
decision
investor
catch
a
break
under
the
tax
law
if
they
roll
a
windfall
into
a
new
venture
within
a
couple
of
month
but
even
by
silicon
valley
s
high
risk
standard
it
be
shock
to
put
so
much
of
one
s
newfound
wealth
into
something
as
iffy
as
an
online
bank
all
told
musk
invest
about
million
into
x
com
leave
him
after
tax
with
million
or
so
for
personal
use
that
s
part
of
what
separate
elon
from
mere
mortal
say
ed
ho
the
former
zip
executive
who
go
on
to
cofound
x
com
he
s
willing
to
take
an
insane
amount
of
personal
risk
when
you
do
a
deal
like
that
it
either
pay
off
or
you
end
up
in
a
bus
shelter
somewhere
musk
s
decision
to
invest
so
much
money
in
x
com
look
even
more
unusual
in
hindsight
much
of
the
point
of
be
a
dot
com
success
in
be
to
prove
yourself
once
stash
away
your
million
and
then
use
your
credential
to
talk
other
people
into
bet
their
money
on
your
next
venture
musk
would
certainly
go
on
to
rely
on
outside
investor
but
he
put
major
skin
in
the
game
as
well
so
while
musk
could
be
found
on
television
talk
like
the
rest
of
the
self
absorbed
dot
com
schmuck
he
behave
more
like
a
throwback
to
silicon
valley
s
earlier
day
when
the
founder
of
company
like
intel
be
willing
to
take
huge
gamble
on
themselves
where
zip
have
be
a
neat
useful
idea
x
com
held
the
promise
of
foment
a
major
revolution
musk
for
the
first
time
would
be
confront
a
deep
pocket
entrench
industry
head
on
with
the
hope
of
upend
all
of
the
incumbent
musk
also
begin
to
hone
his
trademark
style
of
enter
an
ultracomplex
business
and
not
let
the
fact
that
he
knew
very
little
about
the
industry
s
nuance
bother
him
in
the
slightest
he
have
an
inkling
that
the
banker
be
do
finance
all
wrong
and
that
he
could
run
the
business
well
than
everyone
else
musk
s
ego
and
confidence
have
start
head
toward
the
level
that
would
inspire
some
and
leave
others
think
of
him
as
pompous
and
unscrupulous
the
creation
of
x
com
would
ultimately
reveal
a
great
deal
about
musk
s
creativity
relentless
drive
confrontational
style
and
foible
as
a
leader
musk
would
also
get
another
taste
of
be
push
aside
at
his
own
company
and
the
pain
that
accompanies
a
grand
vision
left
unfulfilled
musk
assemble
what
look
like
an
all
star
crew
to

met

during
his
time
as
an
intern
at
the
bank
of
nova

and
the

really

of
the

emerge
as
the

shareholder
thanks
to
his

up

so
many
silicon

operation
at
a
house

the
cofounder
begin
brainstorming
and
then
move
to
more
formal
office
at
university
avenue
in
palo

the
cofounder
be
align
philosophically
around
the
idea
that
the
banking
industry
have
fall
behind
the
time
visit
a
branch
bank
to
speak
with
a
teller

pretty
archaic
now
that
the
internet
have
arrive
the
rhetoric
sound
good
and
the
four
men
be
enthuse
the
only
thing
stop
them
be
reality
musk
have
a
modicum
of
banking
experience
and
have
resort
to
buying
a
book
on
the
industry
to
help
understand
its
inner
working
the
more
the
cofounder
thought
about
their
plan
of
attack
the
more
they
realize
the
regulatory
issue
block
the
creation
of
an
online
bank
be
insurmountable
as
four
and
five
month
go
by
the
onion
just
kept
unwrap
say
ho
from
the
outset
there
be
personality
clash
as
well
musk
have
become
a
budding
superstar
in
silicon
valley
and
have
the
press
fawn
over
him
this
didn
t
sit
that
well
with
fricker
who
d
move
from
canada
and
pegged
x
com
as
his
chance
to
make
a
mark
on
the
world
as
a
banking
whiz
fricker
accord
to
numerous
people
want
to
run
x
com
and
do
so
in
a
more
conventional
manner
he
found
musk
s
visionary
statement
to
the
press
about
rethink
the
entire
banking
industry
silly
since
the
company
be
struggle
to
build
much
of
anything
we
be
out
promising
the
sun

i
will

that
the

have
already
move

relent
i
talk
to

it
wasn
t
so
much
that
i
want
to
be

more
like
hey
i
think
there
be
some
pretty
important
thing
that
need
to
happen
and
if
i
m
not
ceo
i
m
not
sure
they
be
go
to
happen
but
then
i
talk
to
max
and
peter
and
it
seem
like
they
would
make
these
thing
happen
so
then
i

it

not
the

many
of
the

my
view
i
be
very
vocal
about
how
i
thought
it
be
bullshit
but
i
knew
fundamentally
that
the
company
be
do
well
it
be
a
rocket
ship
and
i
wasn
t
go

twenty
three
go
into

me
vent
it
all
out

their

be
part
of
the
reason
i
stayed

detailed
seven
reason
why
he
deserve

status
of

include
his
role
as
its
large
shareholder
the
hire
of
a
lot
of
the
top
talent
the
creation
of
a
number
of
the
company
s
most
successful
business
idea
and
his
time
as
ceo
when
the
company
go
from
sixty
to
several
hundred
employee
almost
everyone
i
interviewed
from
the
paypal
day
lean
toward
agree
with
musk
s
overall
assessment
they
say
that
jackson
s
account
border
on
fantasy
when
it
come
to
celebrate
the
confinity
team
over
musk
and
the
x
com
team
there
be
a
lot
of
paypal
people
that
suffer
from
warp
memory
say
botha
but
these
same
people
reach
another
consensus
say
that
musk
have
mishandle
the
branding
technology
infrastructure
and
fraud
situation
i
think
it
would
have
kill
the
company
if
elon
have
stayed
on
as
ceo
for
six
more
month
say
botha
the
mistake
elon
be
make
at
the
time
be
amplify
the
risk
of
the
business
for
more
on
musk
s
take
on
the
paypal
year
see
appendix
the
suggestion
that
musk
do
not
count
as
a
true
cofounder
of
paypal
seem
asinine
in
retrospect
thiel
levchin
and
other
paypal
executive
have
say
as
much
in
the
year
since
the
ebay
deal
close
the
only
useful
thing
such
criticism
produce
be
the
bombastic
counteroffensive
from
musk
which
reveal
touch
of
insecurity
and
the
seriousness
with
which
musk
insists
that
the
historical
record
reflect
his
take
on
event
he
come
from
the
school
of
thought
in
the
public
relation
world
that
you
let
no
inaccuracy
go
uncorrected
say
vince
sollitto
the
former
communication
chief
at
paypal
it
set
a
precedent
and
you
should
fight
every
out
of
place
comma
tooth
and
nail
he
take
thing
very
personally
and
usually
seek
war
the
strong
critique
of
musk
during
this
period
of
his
life
be
that
he
have
succeed
to
a
large
degree
despite
himself
musk
s
trait
as
a
confrontational
know
it
all
and
his
abundant
ego
create
deep
last
fracture
within
his
company
while
musk
consciously
try
to
temper
his
behavior
these
effort
be
not
enough
to
win
over
investor
and
more
experienced
executive
at
both
zip
and
paypal
the
company
board
come
to
the
conclusion
that
musk
be
not
yet
ceo
material
it
can
also
be
argue
that
musk
have
become
a
hyperbolic
huckster
who
overreach
and
oversold
his
company
technology
musk
s
big
detractor
have
make
all
of
these
argument
either
in
public
or
private
and
a
half
dozen
or
so
of
them
say
far
bad
thing
to
me
about
his
character
and
action
describe
musk
as
unethical
in
business
and
vicious
with
his
personal
attack
almost
universally
these
people
be
unwilling
to
go
on
the
record
with
their
comment
claim
to
be
afraid
musk
would
pursue
litigation
against
them
or
ruin
their
ability
to
do
business
these
criticism
must
be
weigh
against
musk
s
track
record
he
demonstrate
an
innate
ability
to
read
people
and
technology
trend
at
the
inception
of
the
consumer
web
while
others
try
to
wrap
their
head
around
the
internet
s
implication
musk
have
already
set
off
on
a
purposeful
plan
of
attack
he
envision
many
of
the
early
piece
of
technology
directory
map
site
that
focus
on
vertical
market
that
would
become
mainstay
on
the
web
then
just
as
people
become
comfortable
with
buying
thing
from
amazon
com
and
ebay
musk
make
the
great
leap
forward
to
full
fledge
internet
banking
he
would
bring
standard
financial
instrument
online
and
then
modernize
the
industry
with
a
host
of
new
concept
he
exhibit
a
deep
insight
into

his

found
a

he
d
spent

court
justine
wilson
from
afar
fly
her
out
for
visit
on
the
weekend
for
a
long
time
his
oppressive
hour
and
his

put
a
crimp
on
the

but
the
zip
sale
let
musk
buy
a
place
of
his
own
and
pay
a
bit
more
attention
to
justine
like
any
couple
they
have
their
ups
and
down
but
that
passion
of
young
love
remain
we
fought
a
lot
but
when
we
weren
t
fight
there
be
a
deep
sense
of
compassion
a
bond
justine
say
the
couple
have
be
spar
for
a
few
day
about
phone
call
justine
kept
get
from
an
ex
boyfriend
elon
didn
t
like
that
and
have
a
major
spat
while
walk
near
the
x
com
office
i
remember
think
it
be
a
lot
of
drama
and
that
if
i
be
go
to
put
up
with
it
we
might
as
well
be
married
i
told
him
he
should
just
propose
to
me
justine
say
it
take
musk
a
few
minute
to
cool
down
and
then
he
do
just
that
propose
on
the
spot
a
few
day
later
a
more
chivalrous
musk
return
to
the
sidewalk
get
down
on
bend
knee
and
present
justine
with
a
ring
justine
knew
all
about
musk
s
grim
childhood
and
the
intense
range
of
emotion
he
could
exhibit
her
romantic
sensibility
overrode
any
trepidation
she
might
have
have
about
these
part
of
musk
s
history
and
character
and
center
instead
on
his
strength
musk
often
talk
fondly
about
alexander
the
great
and
justine
saw
him
as
her
own
conquer
hero
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
responsibility
she
say
he
didn
t
run
from
thing
he
want
to
get
married
and
have
kid
early
on
musk
also
exude
a
confidence
and
passion
that
make
justine
think
life
with
him
would
always
be
okay
money
be
not
his
motivation
and
quite
frankly
i
think
it
just
happens
for
him
justine
say
it
s
just
there
he
know
he
can
generate
it
at
their
wedding
reception
justine
encounter
the
other
side
of
the
conquer
hero
musk
pull
justine
close
while
they
dance
and
inform
her
i
be
the
alpha
in
this
relationship
two
month
later
justine
sign
a
postnuptial
financial
agreement
that
would
come
back
to
haunt
her
and
enter
into
an
endure
power
struggle
she
described
the
situation
year
later
in
an
article
for
marie
claire
write

then
have
it
derail
by
the

it
take
until
late
december
for

to
calm
down
enough
for

he
didn
t
know
a
lot
about

want
to
know
exactly
what

be
plan
in

not
entirely
sure
what
to

of
his
mental
state
he
d
lose
a
tremendous
amount
of
weight
fight
off
malaria
and
look
almost
skeletal
with
little
prompt
musk
would
start
expound
on
his
desire
to
do
something

with
his
life
something
last
his
next
move
have
to
be
either
in
solar
or
in
space
he
say
the
logical
thing
to
happen
next
be
solar
but
i
can
t
figure
out
how
to
make
any
money
out
of
it
say
george
zachary
the
investor
and
close
friend
of
musk
s
recall
a
lunch
date
at
the
time
then
he
start
talk
about
space
and
i
thought
he
meant
office
space
like
a
real
estate
play
musk
have
actually
start
think
big
than
the
mar
society
rather
than
send
a
few
mouse
into
earth
s
orbit
musk
want
to
send
them
to
mar
some
very
rough
calculation
do
at
the
time
suggest
that
the
journey
would
cost
million
he
ask
if
i
thought
that
be
crazy
zachary
say
i
ask
do
the
mouse
come
back
because
if
they
don
t
yeah
most
people
will
think
that
s
crazy
as
it
turn
out
the
mouse
be
not
only
meant
to
go
to
mar
and
come
back
but
be
also
meant
to
procreate
along
the
way
during
a
journey
that
would
take
month
jeff
skoll
another
one
of
musk
s
friend
who
make
a
fortune
at
ebay
point
out
that
the
fornicate
mouse
would
need
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
cheese
and
bought
musk
a
giant
wheel
of
le
brou
re
a
type
of
gruy
re
musk
do
not
mind
become
the
butt
of
cheese
joke
the
more
he
thought
about
space
the
more
important
its
exploration
seem
to
him
he
felt
as
if
the
public
have
lose
some
of
its
ambition
and
hope
for
the
future
the
average
person
might
see
space
exploration
as
a
waste
of
time
and
effort
and
rib
him
for
talk
about
the
subject
but
musk
thought
about
interplanetary
travel
in
a
very
earnest
way
he
want
to
inspire
the
mass
and
reinvigorate
their
passion
for
science
conquest
and
the
promise
of
technology
his
fear
that
mankind
have
lose
much
of
its
will
to
push
the
boundary
be
reinforce
one
day
when
musk
go
to
the
nasa
website
he
d
expect
to
find
a
detailed
plan
for
explore
mar
and
instead
found
bupkis
at
first
i
thought
jeez
maybe
i
m
just
look
in
the
wrong
place
musk
once
told
wire
why
be
there
no
plan
no
schedule
there
be
nothing
it
seem
crazy
musk
believe
that
the
very
idea
of
america
be
intertwine
with
humanity
s
desire
to
explore
he
found
it
sad
that
the
american
agency
tasked
with
do
audacious
thing
in
space
and
explore
new
frontier
as
its
mission
seem
to
have
no
serious
interest
in
investigate
mar
at
all
the
spirit
of
manifest
destiny
have
be
deflate
or
maybe
even
come
to
a
depress
end
and
hardly
anyone
seem
to
care
like
so
many
quest
to
revitalize
america
s
soul
and
bring
hope
to
all
of
mankind

this
time
musk
have
built
up
a
decent
network
of
contact
in
the
space
industry
and
he
brought
the
best
of
them
together
at
a
series
of
salon
sometimes
at
the

jpl
and
be
just
in
the
process
of
leave
orbital
science
corporation
a
maker
of
satellite
and
spacecraft
where
he
have
be
chief
technical
officer
and
the
general
manager
of
the
space
system
group
it
could
be
argue
that
no
one
on
the
planet
knew
more
about
the
reality
of
get
thing
into
space
than
griffin
and
he
be
work
for
musk
as
space
thinker
in
chief
four
year
later
in
griffin
take
over
as
head
of
nasa
the
expert
be
thrill
to
have
another
rich
guy
appear
who
be
willing
to
fund
something
interest
in
space
they
happily
debate
the
merit
and
feasibility
of
send
up
rodent
and
watch
them
hump
but
as
the
discussion
wore
on
a
consensus
start
to
build
around
pursue
a
different
project
something
call
mar
oasis
under
this
plan
musk
would
buy
a
rocket
and
use
it
to
shoot
what
amount
to
a
robotic
greenhouse
to
mar
a
group
of
researcher
have
already
be
work
on
a
space
ready
growth
chamber
for
plant
the
idea
be
to
modify
their
structure
so
that
it
could
open
up
briefly
and
suck
in
some
of
the
martian
regolith
or
soil
and
then
use
it
to
grow
a
plant
which
would
in
turn
produce
the
first
oxygen
on
mar
much
to
musk
s
like
this
new
plan
seem
both
ostentatious
and
feasible
musk
want
the
structure
to
have
a
window
and
a
way
to
send
a
video
feedback
to
earth
so
that
people
could
watch
the
plant
grow
the
group
also
talk
about
send
out
kit
to
student
around
the
country
who
would
grow
their
own
plant
simultaneously
and
take
notice
for
example
that
the
martian
plant
could
grow
twice
as
high
as
its
earth
bound
counterpart
in
the
same
amount
of
time
this
concept
have
be
float
around
in
various
form
for
a
while
say
dave
bearden
a
space
industry
veteran
who
attend
the
meeting
it
would
be
yes
there
be
life
on
mar
and
we
put
it
there
the
hope
be
that
it
might
turn
on
a
light
for
thousand
of
kid
that
this
place
be
not
that
hostile
then
they
might
start
think
maybe
we
should
go
there
musk
s
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
start
to
inspire
the
group
many
of
whom
have
grown
cynical
about
anything
novel
happen
in
space
again
he
s
a
very
smart
very
driven
guy
with
a
huge
ego
bearden
say
at
one
point
someone
mention
that
he
might
become
time
magazine
s
man
of
the
year
and
you
could
see
him
light
up
he
have
this
belief
that
he
be
the
guy
who
can
change
the
world
the
main
thing
trouble
the
space
expert
be
musk
s
budget
follow
the
salon
it
seem
like
musk
want
to
spend
somewhere
between
million
and
million
on
the
stunt
and
everyone
knew
that
the
cost
of
a
rocket
launch
alone
would
eat
up
that
money
and
then
some
in
my
mind
you
need
two
hundred
million
dollar
to
do
it
right
bearden
say
but
people
be
reluctant
to
bring
too
much
reality
into
the
situation
too
early
and
just
get
the
whole
idea
kill
then
there
be
the
immense
engineering
challenge
that
would
need
solve
to
have
a
big
window
on
this
thing
be
a
real
thermal
problem
bearden
say
you
could
not
keep
the
container
warm
enough
to
keep
anything
alive
scoop
martian
soil
into
the
structure
seem
not
only
hard
to
do
physically
but
also
like
a
flat
out
bad
idea
since
the
regolith
would
be
toxic
for
a
while
the
scientist
debate
grow
the
plant
in
a
nutrient
rich
gel
instead
but
that
felt
like
cheat
and
like
it
might
undermine
the
whole
point
of
the
endeavor
even
the
optimistic
moment
be
awash
in
unknown
one
scientist
found
some
very
resilient
mustard
seed
and
thought
they
could
possibly
survive
a
treat
version
of
the
martian
soil
there
be
a
pretty
big
downside
if
the
plant
didn
t
survive
bearden
say
you
have
this
dead
garden
on
mar
that
end
up
give
off
the
opposite
of
the
intend
effect
musk
never
flinch
he
turn
some
of
the
volunteer
thinker
into
consultant
and
put
them
to
work
on
the
plant
machine
s
design
he
also
plot
a
trip
to
russia
to
find
out
exactly
how
much
a
launch
would
cost
musk
intend
to
buy
a
refurbish
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
or
icbm
from
the
russian
and
use
that
as
his
launch
vehicle
for
help
with
this
musk
reach
out
to
jim
cantrell
an
unusual
fellow
who
have
do
a
mix
of
classify
and
unclassified
work
for
the
united
state
and
other
government
among
other
claim
to
fame
cantrell
have
be
accuse
of
espionage
and
place
under
house
arrest
in
by
the
russian
after
a
satellite
deal
go
awry
after
a
couple
of
week
al
gore
make
some
call
and
it
get
work
out
cantrell
say
i
didn
t
want
anything
to
do
with
the
russian
again
ever
musk
have
other
idea
cantrell
be
drive
his
convertible
on
a
hot
july
even
in
utah
when
a
call
come
in
this
guy
in
a
funny
accent
say
i
really
need
to
talk
to
you
i
be
a
billionaire
i
be
go
to
start
a
space
program
cantrell
could
not
hear
musk
well
he
thought
his
name
be
ian
musk
and
say
he
would
call
back
once
he
get
home
the
two
men
didn
t
exactly
trust
each
other
at
the
outset
musk
refuse
to
give
cantrell
his
cell
phone
number
and
make
the
call
from
his
fax
machine
cantrell
found
musk
both
intrigue
and
all
too
eager
he
ask
if
there
be
an
airport
near
me
and
if
i
could
meet
the
next
day
cantrell
say
my
red
flag
start
go
off
fear
one
of
his
enemy
be
try
to
orchestrate
an
elaborate
setup
cantrell
told
musk
to
meet
him
at
the
salt
lake
city
airport
where
he
would
rent
a
conference
room
near
the
delta
lounge
i
want
him
to
meet
me
behind
security
so
he
couldn
t
pack
a
gun
cantrell
say
when
the
meeting
finally
take
place
musk
and
cantrell
hit
it
off
musk
roll
out
his
human
need
to
become
a
multiplanetary
specie
speech
and
cantrell
say
that
if
musk
be
really
serious
he
d
be
willing
to
go
to
russia
again
and
help
buy
a
rocket
in
late
october
musk
cantrell
and
adeo
ressi
musk
s
friend
from
college
board
a
commercial
flight
to
moscow
ressi
have
be
play
the
role
of
musk
s
guardian
and
try
to
ascertain
whether
his
best
friend
have
start
to
lose
his
mind
compilation
video
of
rocket
explode
be
make
and
intervention
be
held
with
musk
s
friend
try
to
talk
him
out
of
waste
his
money
while
these
measure
fail
adeo
go
along
to
russia
to
try
to
contain
musk
as
best
as
he
could
adeo
would
call
me
to
the
side
and
say
what
elon
be
do
be
insane
a
philanthropic
gesture
that
s
crazy
cantrell
say
he
be
seriously
worried
but
be
down
with
the
trip
and
why
not
the
men
be
head
to
russia
at
the
height
of
its
freewheel
post
soviet
day
when
rich
guy
could
apparently
buy
space
missile
on
the
open
market
team
musk
would
grow
to
include
mike
griffin
and
meet
with
the
russian
three
time
over
a
period
of
four
month
the
group
set
up
a
few
meeting
with
company
like
npo
lavochkin
which
have
make
probe
intend
for
mar
and
venus
for
the
russian
federal
space
agency
and
kosmotras
a
commercial
rocket
launcher
the
appointment
all
seem
to
go
the
same
way
follow
russian
decorum
the
russian
who
often
skip
breakfast
would
ask
to
meet
around
a
m
at
their
office
for
an
early
lunch
then
there
would
be
small
talk
for
an
hour
or
more
as
the
meeting
attendee
picked
over
a
spread
of
sandwich
sausage
and
of
course
vodka
at
some
point
during
this
process
griffin
usually
start
to
lose
his
patience
he
suffers
fool
very
poorly
cantrell
say
he
s
look
around
and
wonder
when
we
re
go
to
get
down
to
fuck
business
the
answer
be
not
soon
after
lunch
come
a
lengthy
smoking
and
coffee
drinking
period
once
all
of
the
table
be
clear
the
russian
in
charge
would
turn
to
musk
and
ask
what
be
it
you
re
interested
in
buying
the
big
windup
may
not
have
bother
musk
as
much
if
the
russian
have
take
him
more
seriously
they
look
at
us
like
we
be
not
credible
people
cantrell
say
one
of
their
chief
designer
spit
on
me
and
elon
because
he
thought
we
be
full
of
shit
the
most
intense
meeting
occur
in
an
ornate
neglect
prerevolutionary
building
near
downtown
moscow
the
vodka
shot
start
to
space
to
america
while
musk
sat
on
million
which
he
hop
would
be
enough
to
buy
three
icbm
that
could
be
retool
to
go
to
space
buzz
from
the
vodka
musk
ask
point
blank
how
much
a
missile
would
cost
the
reply
million
each
musk
counter
offering
million
for
two
they
sat
there
and
look
at
him
cantrell
say
and
say
something
like
young
boy
no
they
also
intimate
that
he
didn
t
have
the
money
at
this
point
musk
have
decide
the
russian
be
either
not
serious
about
do
business
or
determine
to
part
a
dot
com
millionaire
from
as
much
of
his
money
as
possible
he
storm
out
of
the
meeting
the
team
musk
mood
could
not
have
be
bad
it
be
near
the
end
of
february
and
they
go
outside
to
hail
a
cab
and
drove
straight
to
the
airport
surround
by
the
snow
and
dreck
of
the
moscow
winter
inside
the
cab
no
one
talk
musk
have
come
to
russia
fill
with
optimism
about
put
on
a
great
show
for
mankind
and
be
now
leave
exasperate
and
disappointed
by
human
nature
the
russian
be
the
only
one
with
rocket
that
could
possibly
fit
within
musk
s
budget
it
be
a
long
drive
cantrell
say
we
sat
there
in
silence
look
at
the
russian
peasant
shopping
in
the
snow
the
somber
mood
linger
all
the
way
to
the
plane
until
the
drink
cart
arrive
you
always
feel
particularly
good
when
the
wheel
lift
off
in
moscow
cantrell
say
it
s
like
my
god
i
make
it
so
griffin
and
i
get
drink
and
clinked
our
glass
musk
sat
in
the
row
in
front
of
them
type
on
his
computer
we
re
think
fuck
nerd
what
can
he
be
do
now
at
which
point
musk
wheel
around
and
flash
a
spreadsheet
he
d
create
hey
guy
he
say
i
think
we
can
build
this
rocket
ourselves
griffin
and
cantrell
have
down
a
couple
of
drink
by
this
time
and
be
too
deflate
to
entertain
a
fantasy
they
knew
all
too
well
the
story
of
gung
ho
millionaire
who
thought
they
could
conquer
space
only
to
lose
their
fortune
just
the
year
before
andrew
beal
a
real
estate
and
finance
whiz
in
texas
fold
his
aerospace
company
after
have
pour
million
into
a
massive
test
site
we
re
think
yeah
you
and
whose
fuck
army
cantrell
say
but
elon
say
no
i
m
serious
i
have
this
spreadsheet
musk
pass
his
laptop
over
to
griffin
and
cantrell
and
they
be
dumbfound
the
document
detailed
the
cost
of
the
material
need
to
build
assemble
and
launch
a
rocket
accord
to
musk
s
calculation
he
could
undercut
exist
launch
company
by
building
a
modest
size
rocket
that
would
cater
to
a
part
of
the
market
that
specialized
in
carry
small
satellite
and
research
payload
to
space
the
spreadsheet
also
laid
out
the
hypothetical
performance
characteristic
of
the
rocket
in
fairly
impressive
detail
i
say
elon
where
do
you
get
this
cantrell
say
musk
have
spent
month
study
the
aerospace
industry
and
the
physic
behind
it
from
cantrell
and
others
he
d
borrow
rocket
propulsion
element
fundamental
of
astrodynamics
and
aerothermodynamics
of
gas
turbine
and
rocket
propulsion
along
with
several
more
seminal
text
musk
have
revert
to
his
childhood
state
as
a
devourer
of
information
and
have
emerge
from
this
meditative

about

people
like

see
this

many
time
before
there
be
a
string
of
zillionaires
that
get
sell
a
good
story
by
an
engineer
zubrin
say
combine
my
brain
and
your
money
and
we
can
build
a
rocket
ship
that
will
be
profitable
and
open
up
the
space
frontier
the
techie
usually
end
up
spending
the
rich
guy
s
money
for
two
year
and
then
the
rich
guy
get
bore
and
shuts
the
thing
down
with
elon
everyone
give
a
sigh
and
say
oh
well
he
could
have
spent
ten
million
dollar
to
send
up
the
mouse
but
instead
he
ll
spend
hundred
of
million
and
probably
fail
like
all
the
others
that
proceed
him
while
well
aware
of
the
risk
tie
to
start
a

company
musk
have
at

one
reason
to

he
might

mueller
grow
up
the
son
of
a
logger
in
the
tidy
idaho
town
of
st
mary
where
he
developed
a
reputation
as
an
oddball
while
the
rest
of
the
kid
be
outside
explore
the
wood
in
winter
mueller
stayed
warm
in
the
library
reading
book
or
watch
star
trek
at
his
house
he
also
tinker
walk
to
grade
school
one
day
mueller
discover
a
smash
clock
in
an
alley
and
turn
it
into
a
pet
project
each
day
he
fix
some
part
of
the
clock
a
gear
a
spring
until
he
get
it
work
a
similar
thing
happen
with
the
family
s
lawn
mower
which
mueller
disassemble
one
afternoon
on
the
front
lawn
for
fun
my
dad
come
home
and
be
so
mad
because
he
thought
he
d
have
to
buy
a
new
mower
mueller
say
but
i
put
it
back
together
and
it
ran
mueller
then
get
stuck
on
rocket
he
start
buying
mail
order
kit
and
follow
the
instruction
to
build
small
rocket
rather
quickly
mueller
graduate
to
construct
his
own
device
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
craft
a
mock
up
space
shuttle
that
could
be
attach
to
a
rocket
sent
up
into
the
air
and
then
glide
back
to
the
ground
for
a
science
project
a
couple
of
year
later
mueller
borrow
his
dad
s
oxyacetylene
weld
equipment
to
make
a
rocket
engine
prototype
mueller
cool
the
device
by
place
it
upside
down
in
a
coffee
can
full
of
water
i
could
run
it
like
that
all
day
long
and
invent
equally
creative
way
to
measure
its
performance
the
machine
be
good
enough
for
mueller
to
win
a
couple
of
regional
science
fair
competition
and
end
up
at
an
international
event
that
s
where
i
promptly
get
my
as
kick
mueller
say
tall
lanky
and
with
a
rectangular
face
mueller
be
an
easygoing
sort
who
muddle
through
college
for
a
bit
teach
his
friend
how
to
make
smoke
bomb
and
then
eventually
settle
down
and
do
well
as
a
mechanical
engineering
student
fresh
out
of

he
work
for
hughes
aircraft
on

it
be

then
go

it
be
the

half
of
the

mueller
travel
out

with
the

be
one
of
the
club
s
standouts
able
to
build
thing
that
actually
work
and
could
experiment
with
some
of
the
more
radical
concept
that
be
quashed
by
his
conservative
boss
at

i
still
keep
the

hang
in
my
garage
mueller
say
in
january
mueller
be
hang
out
in
the
workshop
of
john
garvey
who
have
left
a
job
at
the
aerospace
company
mcdonnell
douglas
to
start
building
his
own
rocket
garvey
s
facility
be
in
huntington
beach
where
he
rent
an
industrial
space
about
the
size
of
a
six
car
garage
the
two
men
be
fiddle
around
with
the
eighty
pound
engine
when
garvey
mention
that
a
guy
name
elon
musk
might
be
stop
by
the
amateur
rocketry
scene
be
tight
and
it
be
cantrell
who
recommend
that
musk
check
out
garvey
s
workshop
and
see
mueller
s
design
on
a
sunday
musk
arrive
with
a
pregnant
justine
wear
a
stylish
black
leather
trench
coat
and
look
like
a
high
paid
assassin
mueller
have
the
eighty
pound
engine
on
his
shoulder
and
be
try
to
bolt
it
to
a
support
structure
when
musk
begin
pepper
him
with
question
he
ask
me
how
much
thrust
it
have
mueller
say
he
want
to
know
if
i
have
ever
work
on
anything
big
i
told
him
that
yeah
i
d
work
on
a
pound
thrust
engine
at
trw
and
knew
every
part
of
it
mueller
set
the
engine
down
and
try
to
keep
up
with
musk
s
interrogation
how
much
would
that
big
engine
cost
musk
ask
mueller
told
him
trw
built
it
for
about
million
musk
shot
back
yeah
but
how
much
could
you
really
do
it
for
mueller
end
up
chat
with
musk
for
hour
the
next
weekend
mueller
invite
musk
to
his
house
to
continue
their
discussion
musk
knew
he
have
found
someone
who
really
knew
the
in
and
out
of
make
rocket
after
that
musk
introduce
mueller
to
the
rest
of
his
roundtable
of
space
expert
and
their
stealthy
meeting
the
caliber
of
the
people
impressed
mueller
who
have
turn
down
past
job
offer
from
beal
and
other
budding
space
magnate
because
of
their
borderline
insane
idea
musk
by
contrast
seem
to
know
what
he
be
do
weed
out
the
naysayer
meeting
by
meeting
and
form
a
crew
of
bright
commit
engineer
mueller
have
help
musk
fill
out
that
spreadsheet
around
the
performance
and
cost
metric
of
a
new
low
cost
rocket
and
along
with
the
rest
of
team
musk
have
subsequently
refine
the
idea
the
rocket
would
not
carry
truck
size
satellite
like
some
of
the
monster
rocket
flown
by
boeing
lockheed
the
russian
and
others
country
instead
musk
s
rocket
would
be
aim
at
the
low
end
of
the
satellite
market
and
it
could
end
up
as
ideal
for
an
emerge
class
of
small
payload
that
capitalize
on
the
massive
advance
that
have
take
place
in
recent
year
in
compute
and
electronics
technology
the
rocket
would
cater
directly
to
a
theory
in
the
space
industry
that
a
whole
new
market
might
open
for
both
commercial
and
research
payload
if
a
company
could
drastically
low
the
price
per
launch
and
perform
launch
on
a
regular
schedule
musk
relish
the
idea
of
be
at
the
forefront
of
this
trend
and
develop
the
workhorse
of
a
new
era
in
space
of
course
all
of
this
be
theoretical
and
then
suddenly
it
wasn
t
paypal
have
go
public
in
february
with
its
share
shoot
up
percent
and
musk
knew
that
ebay
want
to
buy
the
company
as
well
while
noodling
on
the
rocket
idea
musk
s
net
worth
have
increase
from
ten
of
million
to
hundred
of
million
in
april
musk
fully
abandon
the
publicity
stunt
idea
and
commit
to
building
a
commercial
space
venture
he
pull
aside
cantrell
griffin
mueller
and
chris
thompson
an
aerospace
engineer
at
boeing
and
told
the
group
i
want
to
do
this
company
if
you
guy
be
in
let
s
do
it
griffin
want
to
join
but
end
up
decline
when
musk
rebuffed
his
request
to
live
on
the
east
coast
and
cantrell
only
stuck
around
for
a
few
month
after
this
meeting
see
the
venture
as
too
risky
found
in
june
space
exploration
technology
come
to
life
in
humble
setting
musk
acquire
an
old
warehouse
at
east
grand
avenue
in
el
segundo
a
suburb
of
los
angeles
hum
with
the
activity
of
the
aerospace
industry
the
previous
tenant
of
the
square
foot
building
have
do
lot
of
shipping
and
have
use
the
south
side
of
the
facility
as
a
logistics
depot
outfit
it
with
several
receive
bay
for
delivery
truck
this
allow
musk
to
drive
his
silver
mclaren
right
into
the
building
beyond
that
the
surroundings
be
sparse
just
a
dusty
floor
and
a
forty
foot
high
ceiling
with
its
wooden
beam
and
insulation
expose
and
which
curve
at
the
top
to
give
the
place
a
hangarlike
feel
the
north
side
of
the
building
be
an
office
space
with
cubicle
and
room
for
about
fifty
people
during
the
first

of

delivery
truck
show
up
packed
full
of
dell

and
fold

that
would
serve
as

walk
over
to
one
of
the

roll
up
the

off

the

himself
musk
have
soon
transform
the
spacex
office
with
what
have
become
his
signature
factory
aesthetic
a
glossy
epoxy
coat
apply
over
concrete
on
the
floor
and
a
fresh
coat
of
white

intersperse
around
the
factory
so
that
ivy
league
computer
scientist
and
engineer
design
the
machine
could
sit
with
the
welder
and
machinist
building
the
hardware
this
approach
stood
as
spacex
s
first
major
break
with
traditional
aerospace
company
that
prefer
to
cordon
different
engineering
group
off
from
each
other
and
typically
separate
engineer
and
machinist
by
thousand
of
mile
by
place
their
factory
in
location
where
real

run
cheap
as
the
first
dozen
or
so
employee
come
to
the
office
they
be
told
that
spacex
s
mission
would
be
to
emerge
as
the
southwest
airline
of
space
spacex
would
build
its
own
engine
and
then
contract
with
supplier
for
the
other
component
of
the
rocket
the
company
would
gain
an
edge
over
the
competition
by
building
a
well
cheaper
engine
and
by
fine
tune
the
assembly
process
to
make
rocket
faster
and
cheaper
than
anyone
else
this
vision
include
the
construction
of
a
type
of
mobile
launch
vehicle
that
could
travel
to
various
site
take
the
rocket
from
a
horizontal
to
vertical
position
and
send
it
off
to
space
no
mus
no
fuss
spacex
be
meant
to
get
so
good
at
this
process
that
it
could
do
multiple
launch
a
month
make
money
off
each
one
and
never
need
to
become
a
huge
contractor
dependent
on
government

spacex
be
to
be
america
s
attempt
at
a
clean
slate
in
the
rocket
business
a
modernize
reset
musk
felt
that
the
space
industry
have
not
really
evolve
in
about
fifty
year
the
aerospace
company
have
little
competition
and
tend
to
make
supremely
expensive
product
that
achieve
maximum
performance
they
be
building
a
ferrari
for
every
launch
when
it
be
possible
that
a
honda
accord
might
do
the
trick
musk
by
contrast
would
apply
some
of
the
start
up
technique
he
d
learn
in
silicon
valley
to
run
spacex
lean
and
fast
and
capitalize
on
the
huge
advance
in
compute
power
and
material
that
have
take
place
over
the
past
couple
of
decade
as
a
private
company
spacex
would
also
avoid
the
waste
and
cost
overrun
associate
with
government
contractor
musk
declare
that
spacex
s
first
rocket
would
be

musk
set
an
insanely
ambitious
timeline
for
all
of
this
one
of
the
early
spacex
presentation
suggest
that
the

would
complete
its

in

a

in
june
the

have
everything
assemble
in

a

would
then
be
prepared
by
september
and
the

would
take

in

about
fifteen

after
the

start

of
the

this
be
musk
the
logical
na

optimist
tabulate
how
long
it
should
take
people
physically
to
perform
all
of
this
work
it
s
the
baseline
he
expect
of
himself
and
one
that
his
employee
with
their
human
foible
be
in
a
never
end
struggle
to
match
as
space
enthusiast
start
to
learn
about
the
new
company
they
didn
t
really
ob
over
whether
musk
s
delivery
schedule
sound
realistic
or
not
they
be
just
thrill
that
someone
have
decide
to
take
the
cheap
and
fast
approach
some
member
of
the
military
have
already
be
promote
the
idea
of
give
the
arm
force
more
aggressive
space
capability
or
what
they
call
responsive
space
if
a
conflict
broke
out
the
military
want
the
ability
to
respond
with
purpose
built
satellite
for
that
mission
this
would
mean
move
away
from
a
model
where
it
take
ten
year
to
build
and
deploy
a
satellite
for
a
specific
job
instead
the
military
desire
cheaper
small
satellite
that
could
be
reconfigured
through
software
and
sent
up
on
short
notice
almost
like
disposable
satellite
if
we
could
pull
that
off
it
would
be
really
game

our

people
thought
we
be
just
crazy
mueller
say
at
trw
i
have
an
army

now
we

go
to

a
low

rocket
from
scratch
with
a
small
team
people
just
didn
t
think
it
could
be
do
in
july
musk
be
gripped
by
the
excitement
of
this
dare
enterprise
and
ebay
make
its
aggressive
move
to
buy
paypal
for
billion
this
deal
give
musk
some
liquidity
and
supply
him
with
more
than
million
to
throw
at
spacex
with
such
a
massive
up
front
investment
no
one
would
be
able
to
wrestle
control
of
spacex
away
from
musk
as
they
have
do
at
zip
and
paypal
for
the
employee
who
have
agree
to
accompany
musk
on
this
seemingly
impossible
journey
the
windfall
provide
at
least
a
couple
of
year
of
job
security
the
acquisition
also
upped
musk
s
profile
and
celebrity
which
he
could
leverage
to
score
meeting
with
top
government
official

to
sway
supplier
and
then
all
of

yanked
musk
out
of

to
keep
him

she

emerge
as
the

oh

how

you

recall
a
spacex
technician
brown
collect
the
weird
e
mail
that
arrive
for
musk
and
sent
them
out
as
kook
of
the
week
missive
to
make
people
laugh
one
of
the
well
entry
include
a
pencil
sketch
of
a
lunar
spacecraft
that
have
a
red
spot
on
the

the
person
who
sent
in
the

have
circle
the
spot
on
his
own
draw
and
then
write
what
be
that
blood
next
to
it
in
other
letter
there
be
plan
for
a
perpetual
motion
machine

a
proposal
for
a
giant
inflatable

that
could
be
use
to
plug

spill
for

extend

in

s
absence
she
pretty
much
call
the
shot
the
technician
say
she
would
say
this
be
what
elon
would
want
her
great
gift
though
may
have
be
reading
musk
s
mood
at
both
spacex
and
tesla
brown
place
her
desk
a
few
foot
in
front
of
musk
s
so
that
people
have
to
pas
her
before
have
a
meeting
with
him
if
someone
need
to
request
permission
to
buy
a
big
ticket
item
they
would
stop
for
a
moment
in
front
of
brown
and
wait
for
a
nod
to
go
see
musk
or
the
shake
off
to
go
away
because
musk
be
have
a
bad
day
this
system
of
nod
and
shake
become
particularly
important
during
period
of
romantic
strife
for
musk
when
his
nerve
be
on
edge
more
than
usual
the
rank
and
file
engineer
at
spacex
tend
to
be
young
male
overachiever
musk
would
personally
reach
out
to
the
aerospace
department
of
top
college
and
inquire
about
the
student
who
have
finish
with
the
best
mark
on
their
exam
it
be
not
unusual
for
him
to
call
the
student
in
their
dorm
room
and
recruit
them
over
the
phone
i
thought
it
be
a
prank
call
say
michael
colonno
who
heard
from
musk
while
attend
stanford
i
do
not
believe
for
a
minute
that
he
have
a
rocket
company
once
the
student
look
musk
up
on
the
internet
sell
them
on
spacex
be
easy
for
the
first
time
in
year
if
not
decade
young
aeronautics
whizz
who
pin
to
explore
space
have
a
really
excite
company
to
latch
on
to
and
a
path
toward
design
a
rocket
or
even
become
an
astronaut
that
do
not
require
them
to
join
a
bureaucratic
government
contractor
as
word
of
spacex
s
ambition
spread
top
engineer
from
boeing
lockheed
martin
and
orbital
science
with
a
high
tolerance
for
risk
flee
to
the
upstart
too
throughout
the
first
year
at
spacex
one
or
two
new
employee
join
almost
every
week
kevin
brogan
be
employee
no
and
come
from
trw
where
he
d
be
use
to
various
internal
policy
block
him
from
do
work
i
call
it
the
country
club
he
say
nobody
do
anything
brogan
start
at
spacex
the
day
after
his
interview
and
be
told
to
go
hunt
in
the
office
for
a
computer
to
use
it
be
go
to
fry
s
and
get
whatever
you
need
and
go
to
staple
and
get
a
chair
brogan
say
he
immediately
felt
in
over
his
head
and
would
work
for
twelve
hour
drive
home
sleep
for
ten
hour
and
then
head
right
back
to
the
factory
i
be
exhaust
and
out
of
shape
mentally
he
say
but
soon
i
love
it
and
get
totally
hooked
one
of
the
first
project
spacex
decide
to
tackle
be
the
construction
of
a
gas
generator
a
machine
not
unlike
a
small
rocket
engine
that
produce
hot
gas
mueller
buzza
and
a
couple
of
young
engineer
assemble
the
generator
in
los
angeles
and
then
packed
it
into
the
back
of
a
pickup
truck
and
drove
it
out
to
mojave
california
to
test
it
a
desert
town
about
one
hundred
mile
from

sent
up
all
manner
of
cut

the
spacex
team
fit
right
into
this
environment
and
borrow
a
test
stand
from
xcor
that
be
just
about
the
perfect
size
to
hold
the

take
place
at

last
ninety
second
the

it
have
let
out
a
billowing

and
some
of
the

who
have
be
help
out
urge
the
spacex
engineer
to
take
it
easy
and
wait
until
the
next
day
to
run
another
test
instead

a
strong
leader
ready
to
put

to
pick
up
more

talk
the
airport

down
and
get
the

ready
for
another
fire
in
the
day
that
follow
spacex
s
engineer
perfect
a
routine
that
let
them
do
multiple
test
a
day
an
unheard
of
practice
at
the
airport
and
have
the
gas
generator
tune
to
their
like
after
two
week
of
work
they
make
a
few
more
trip
to

jeremy
hollman
be
one
of
the
young
engineer
who
soon
found
himself
living
in
texas
and
customize
the
test
site
to
spacex
s
need
hollman
exemplify
the
kind
of
recruit
musk
want
he
d
earn
an
aerospace
engineering
degree
from
iowa
state
university
and
a
master
s
in
astronautical
engineering
from
the
university
of
southern
california
he
d
spent
a
couple
of
year
work
as
a
test
engineer
at
boeing
deal
with
jet
rocket
and
spacecraft
the
stint
at
boeing
have
left
hollman
unimpressed
with
big
aerospace
his
first
day
on
the
job
come
right
as
boeing
complete
its
merger
with
mcdonnell
douglas
the
resultant
mammoth
government
contractor
held
a
picnic
to
boost
morale
but
end
up
fail
at
even
this
simple
exercise
the
head
of
one
of
the
department
give
a
speech
about
it
be
one
company
with
one
vision
and
then
add
that
the
company
be
very
cost
constrain
hollman
say
he
ask
that
everyone
limit
themselves
to
one
piece
of
chicken
thing
didn
t
improve
much
from
there
every
project
at
boeing
felt
large
cumbersome
and
costly
so
when
musk
come
along
sell
radical
change
hollman
bit
i
thought
it
be
an
opportunity
i
could
not
pas
up
he
say
at
twenty
three
hollman
be
young
single
and
willing
to
give
up
any
semblance
of
have
a
life
in
favor
of
work
at
spacex
nonstop
and
he
become
mueller
s
second
in
command
mueller
have
developed
a
pair
of
three
dimensional
computer
model
of
the
two
engine
he
want
to
build
merlin
would
be
the
engine
for
the
first
stage
of
the
falcon
which
lift
it
off
the
ground
and
kestrel
would
be
the
small
engine
use
to
power
the
upper
second
stage
of
the
rocket
and
guide
it
in
space
together
hollman
and
mueller
figure
out
which
part
of
the
engine
spacex
would
build
at
the
factory
and
which
part
it
would
try
to
buy
for
the
purchase
part
hollman
have
to
head
out
to
various
machine
shop
and
get
quote
and
delivery
date
for
the
hardware
quite
often
the
machinist
told
hollman
that
spacex
s
timeline
be
nut
others
be
more
accommodate
and
would
try
to
bend
an
exist
product
to
spacex
s
need
instead
of
building
something
from
scratch
hollman
also
found
that
creativity
get
him
a
long
way
he
discover
for
example
that
change
the
seal
on
some
readily
available
car
wash
valve
make
them
good
enough
to
be
use
with
rocket
fuel
after
spacex
complete
its
first
engine
at
the
factory
in
california
hollman
load
it
and
mound
of
other
equipment
into
a
u
haul
trailer
he
hitch
the
u
haul
to
the
back
of
a
white
hummer
h
and
drove
four
thousand
pound
of
gear
across
interstate
from
los
angeles
to
texas
and
the
test
site
the
arrival
of
the
engine
in
texas
kick
off
one
of
the
great
bonding
exercise
in
spacex
s
history
amid
rattlesnake
fire
ant
isolation
and
sear
heat
the
group
lead
by
buzza
and
mueller
begin
the
process
of
explore
every
intricacy
of
the
engine
it
be
a
high
pressure
slog
full
of
explosion
or
what
the
engineer
politely
call
rapid
unscheduled
disassembly
that
would
determine
whether
a
small
band
of
engineer
really
could
match
the
effort
and
skill
of
nation
state
the
spacex
employee
christen
the
site
in
fitting
fashion
down
a
bottle
of
r
my
martin
cognac
out
of
paper
cup
and
passing
a
sobriety
test
on
the
drive
back
to
the
company
apartment
in
the
hummer
from
that
point
on
the
trek
from
california
to
the
test
site
become
know
as
the
texas
cattle
haul
the
spacex
engineer
would
work
for
ten
day
straight
come
back
to
california
for
a
weekend
and
then
head
back
to
ease
the
burden
of
travel
musk
sometimes
let
them
use
his
private
jet
it
carry
six
people
mueller
say
well
seven
if
someone
sat
in
the
toilet
which
happen
all
the
time
while
the
navy
and
beal
have
left
some
test
apparatus
spacex
have
to
build
a
large
amount
of
custom
gear
one
of
the
large
of
these
structure
be
a
horizontal
test
stand
about
foot
long
foot
wide
and
foot
tall
then
there
be
the
complementary
vertical
test
stand
that
stood
two
story
high
when
an
engine
need
to
be
fire
it
would
be
fasten
to
one
of
the
test
stand
outfit
with
sensor
to
collect
data
and
monitor
via
several
camera
the
engineer
take
shelter
in
a
bunker
protect
on
one
side
by
a
dirt
embankment
if
something
go
wrong
they
would
look
at
feed
from
the
webcam
or
slowly
lift
one
of
the
bunker
s
hatch
to
listen
for
any
clue
the
local
in
town
rarely
complain
about
the
noise
although
the
animal
on
nearby
farm
seem
less
impressed
cow
have
this
natural
defense
mechanism
where
they
gather
and
start
run
in
a
circle
hollman
say
every
time
we
fire
an
engine
the
cow
scatter
and
then
get
in
that
circle
with
the
young
one
place
in
the
middle
we
set
up
a
cow
cam
to
watch
them
both
kestrel
and
merlin
come
with
challenge
and
they
be
treat
as
alternate
engineering
exercise
we
would
run
merlin
until
we
ran
out
of
hardware
or
do
something
bad
mueller
say
then
we
d
run
kestrel
and
there
be
never
a
shortage
of
thing
to
do
for
month
the
spacex
engineer
arrive
at
the
site
at
a
m
and
spent
twelve
hour
there
work
on
the
engine
before
retire
to
the
outback
steakhouse
for
dinner
mueller
have
a
particular
knack
for
look
over
test
data
and
spot
some
place
where
the
engine
ran
hot
or
cold
or
have
another
flaw
he
would
call
california
and
prescribe
hardware
change
and
engineer
would
refashion
part
and
send
them
off
to
texas
often
the
worker
in
texas
modify
part
themselves
use
a
mill
and
lathe
that
mueller
have
brought
out
kestrel
start
out
as
a
real
dog
and
one
of
my
proudest
moment
be
take
it
from
terrible
to
great
performance
with
stuff
we
bought
online
and
do
in
the
machine
shop
mueller
say
some
member
of
the
texas
crew
hone
their
skill
to
the
point
that
they
could
build
a
test
worthy
engine
in
three
day
these
same
people
be
require
to
be
adept
at
software
they
d
pull
an
all
nighter
building
a
turbo
pump
for
the
engine
and
then
dig
in
the
next
night
to
retool
a
suite
of
application
use
to
control
the
engine
hollman
do
this
type
of
work
all
the
time
and
be
an
all
star
but
he
be
not
alone
among
this
group
of
young
nimble
engineer
who
cross
discipline
out
of
necessity
and
the
spirit
of
adventure
there
be
an
almost
addictive
quality
to
the
experience
hollman
say
you
re
twenty
four
or
twenty
five
and
they
re
trust
you
with
so
much
it
be
very
empower
to
get
to
space
the
merlin
engine
would
need
to
burn
for
second
that
seem
like
an
eternity
for
the
engineer
at
the
outset
of
their
stint
in
texas
when
the
engine
would
burn
for
only
a
half
second
before
it
conked
out
sometimes
merlin
vibrate
too
much
during
the
test
sometimes
it
respond
badly
to
a
new
material
sometimes
it
crack
and
need
major
part
upgrade
like
move
from
an
aluminum
manifold
to
a
manifold
make
out
of
the
more
exotic
inconel
an
alloy
suit
to
extreme
temperature
on
one
occasion
a
fuel
valve
refuse
to
open
properly
and
cause
the
whole
engine
to
blow
up
another
test
go
wrong
end
up
with
the
whole
test
stand
burning
down
it
usually
come
to
buzza
and
mueller
to
make
the
unpleasant
call
back
to
musk
and
recap
the
day
s
foible
elon
have
pretty
good
patience
mueller
say
i
remember
one
time
we
have
two
test
stand
run
and
blew
up
two
thing
in
one
day
i
told
elon
we
could
put
another
engine
on
there
but
i
be
really
really
frustrate
and
just
tire
and
mad
and
be
kinda
short
with
elon
i
say
we
can

shit
today
he

s
fine
just
calm
down
we
ll
do
it
again
tomorrow
coworkers
in
el
segundo
later
report
that
musk
have
be
near
tear
during
this
call
after
hearing
the
frustration
and
agony
in
mueller
s
voice
what
musk
would
not
tolerate
be
excuse
or
the
lack
of
a
clear
plan
of
attack
hollman
be
one
of
many
engineer
who
arrive
at
this
realization
after
face
one
of
musk
s
trademark
grilling
the
bad
call
be
the
first
one
hollman
say
something
have
go
wrong
and
elon
ask
me
how
long
it
would
take
to
be
operational
again
and
i
didn
t
have
an
immediate
answer
he
say
you
need
to
this
be
important
to
the
company
everything
be
rid
on
this
why
don
t
you
have
an
answer
he
kept
hit
me
with
point
direct
question
i
thought
it
be
more
important
to
let
him
know
quickly
what
happen
but
i
learn
it
be
more
important
to
have
all
the
information
from
time
to
time
musk
participate
in
the
test
process
firsthand
one
of
the
more
memorable
example
of
this
come
as
spacex
try
to
perfect
a
cool
chamber
for
its
engine
the
company
have
bought
several
of
these
chamber
at
a
pop
and
need
to
put
them
under
pressure
with
water
to
gauge
their
ability
to
handle
stress
during
the
initial
test
one
of
the
pricey
chamber
crack
then
the
second
one
broke
in
the
same
place
musk
order
a
third
test
as
the
engineer
look
on
in
horror
they
thought
the
test
might
be
put
the
chamber
under
undue
stress
and
that
musk
be
burning
through
essential
equipment
when
the
third
chamber
crack
musk
flew
the
hardware
back
to
california
take
it
to
the
factory
floor
and
with
the
help
of
some
engineer
start
to
fill
the
chamber
with
an
epoxy
to
see
if
it
would
seal
them
he
s
not
afraid
to
get
his
hand
dirty
mueller
say
he
s
out
there
with
his
nice
italian
shoe
and
clothes
and
have
epoxy
all
over
him
they
be
there
all
night
and
test
it
again
and
it
broke
anyway
musk
clothes
ruin
have
decide
the
hardware
be
flaw
test
his
hypothesis
and
move
on
quickly
ask
the
engineer
to
come
up
with
a
new
solution
these
incident
be
all
part
of
a
try
but
productive
process
spacex
have
developed
the
feel
of
a
small
tight
knit
family
up
against
the
world
in
late
the
company
have
an
empty
warehouse
one
year
later
the
facility
look
like
a
real
rocket
factory
work
merlin
engine
be
arrive
back
from
texas
and
be
fed
into
an
assembly
line
where
machinist
could
connect
them
to
the
main
body

more

to
guide
the
rocket
s
body
through
the
factory
from
station
to
station
spacex
have
also
start
to
build
the
fair
or
case
that
protects
payload
atop
the
rocket
during
launch
and
then
open
up
like
a
clam
in
space
to
let
out
the
cargo
spacex
have
picked
up
a
customer
as
well
accord
to
musk
its

period
of
time
respite
as
far
as
they
exist
come
around
p
m
on
some
weeknight
when
musk
would
allow
everyone
to
use
their
work
computer
to
play
first
person
shooter
video
game
like

almost
alarmingly
good
at
these
game
and
have
insanely
fast

he
knew
all
the
trick
and
how
to
sneak
up
on
people
the
pending
launch
ignite
musk
s
salesman
instinct
he
want
to
show
the
public
what
his
tireless
worker
have
accomplish
and
drum
up
some
excitement
around
spacex
musk
decide
to
unveil
a
prototype
of
falcon
to
the
public
in
december
the
company
would
haul
the
seven
story
high
falcon
across
the
country
on
a
specially
built
rig
and
leave
it
and
the

outside
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
s
headquarters
in
washington
d
c
an

would
make
it
clear
to
washington
that
a
modern
smarter
cheaper
rocket
maker
have
arrive
this
marketing
song
and
dance
didn
t
sound
sensible
to
spacex
s
engineer
they
be
work
more
than
one
hundred
hour
per
week
to
make
the
actual
rocket
that
spacex
would
need
to
be
in
business
musk
want
them
to
do
that
and
build
a
slick
look
mock
up
engineer
be
call
back
from
texas
and
assign
another
ulcer
induce
deadline
to
craft
this
prop
in
my
mind
it
be
a
boondoggle
hollman
say
it
wasn
t
advance
anything
in
elon
s
mind
it
would
get
us
a
lot
of
backing
from
important
people
in
the
government
while
make
the
prototype
for
the
event
hollman
experienced
the
full
spectrum
of
high
and
low
that
come
with
work
for
musk
the
engineer
have
lose
his
regular
glass
week
earlier
when
they
slip
off
his
face
and
fell
down
a
flame
duct
at
the
texas
test
site
hollman
have
since
make
do
by
wear
an
old
pair
of
prescription
safety
glass
but
they
too
be
ruin
when
he
scratch
the
lens
while
try
to
duck
under
an
engine
at
the
spacex
factory
without
a
spare
moment
to
visit
an
optometrist
hollman
start
to
feel
his
sanity
fray
the
long
hour
the
scratch
the
publicity
stunt
they
be
all
too
much
he
vent
about
this
in
the
factory
one
night
unaware
that
musk
stood
nearby
and
could
hear
everything
two
hour
later
mary
beth
brown
appear
with
an
appointment
card
to
see
a
lasik
eye
surgery
specialist
when
hollman
visit
the
doctor
he
discover
that
musk
have
already
agree
to
pay
for
the
surgery
elon
can
be
very
demand
but
he
ll
make
sure
the
obstacle
in
your
way
be
remove
hollman
say
upon
reflection
he
also
warm
to
the
long
term
think
behind
musk
s
washington
plan
i
think
he
want
to
add
an
element
of
realism
to
spacex
and
if
you
park
a
rocket
in
someone
s
front
yard
it
s
hard
to
deny
it
hollman
say
the
event
in
washington
end
up
be
well
receive
and
just
a
few
week
after
it
take
place
spacex
make
another
astonish
announcement
despite
not
have
even
flown
a
rocket
yet
spacex
reveal
plan
for
a
second
rocket
along
with
the
falcon
it
would
build
the
falcon
per
the
name
this
rocket
would
have
five
engine
and
could
carry
more
weight
pound
to
low
orbit
around
earth
crucially
the
falcon
could
also
theoretically
reach
the
international
space
station
for
resupply
mission
a
capability
that
would
open
up
spacex
for
some
large
nasa
contract
and
in
a
nod
to
musk
s
obsession
with
safety
the
rocket
be
say
to
be
able
to
complete
its
mission
even
if
three
of
the
five
engine
fail
which
be
a
level
of
add
reliability
that
have
not
be
see
in
the
market
in
decade
the
only
way
to
keep
up
with
all
of
this
work
be
to
do
what
spacex
have
promise
from
the
begin
operate
in
the
spirit
of
a
silicon
valley
start
up
musk
be
always
look
for
brainy
engineer
who
have
not
just
do
well
at
school
but
have
do
something
exceptional
with
their
talent
when
he
found
someone
good
musk
be
relentless
in
court
him
or
her
to
come
to
spacex
bryan
gardner
for
example
first
met
musk
at
a
space
rave
in
the
hangar
at
the
mojave
airport
and
a
short
while
later
start
talk
about
a
job
gardner
be
have
some
of
his
academic
work
sponsor
by
northrop
grumman
elon
say
we
ll
buy
them
out
gardner
say
so
i
e
mail
him
my
resume
at
two
thirty
a
m
and
he
reply
back
in
thirty
minute
address
everything
i
put
in
there
point
by
point
he
say
when
you
interview
make
sure
you
can
talk
concretely
about
what
you
do
rather
than
use
buzzword
it
floor
me
that
he
would
take
the
time
to
do
this
after
be
hire
gardner
be
tasked
with
improve
the
system
for
test
the
valve
on
the
merlin
engine
there
be
dozen
of
valve
and
it
take
three
to
five
hour
to
manually
test
each
one
six
month
later
gardner
have
built
an
automate
system
for
test
the
valve
in
minute
the
test
machine
tracked
the
valve
individually
so
that
an
engineer
in
texas
could
request
what
the
metric
have
be
on
a
specific
part
i
have
be
hand
this
redheaded
stepchild
that
no
one
else
want
to
deal
with
and
establish
my
engineering
credibility
gardner
say
as
the
new
hire
arrive
spacex
move
beyond
its
original
building
to
fill
up
several
building
in
the
el
segundo
complex
the
engineer
be
run
demand
software
and
render
large
graphic
file
and
need
high
speed
connection
between
all
of
these
office
but
spacex
have
neighbor
who
be
block
an
initiative
to
connect
all
of
its
building
via
fiber
optic
line
instead
of
take
the
time
to
haggle
with
the
other
company
for
right
of
way
the
it
chief
branden
spike
who
have
work
with
musk
at
zip
and
paypal
come
up
with
a
quicker
more
devious
solution
a
friend
of
his
work
for
the
phone
company
and
drew
a
diagram
that
demonstrate
a
way

then
ran
cable
straight
to
the
spacex
building
we
do
that
over
a
weekend
instead
of
take
month
to
get
permit
spike
say
there
be
always
this
feel
that
we
be
face
a
sort
of
insurmountable
challenge

that
we
have
to
band
together
to

the

they
do
a
lot
of

these
supplier
also
struggle
to
keep
up
with

found
himself
fly

the

take

at
a

in

call
spincraft

a
couple
of

employee
flew
his

and
arrive
late
at

to
get

when
musk
discover
that

he
turn
to
a

you

us
up

it
doesn
t
feel
good
david
schmitz
be
a
general
manager
at
spincraft
and
say
musk
earn
a
reputation
as
a
fearsome
negotiator
who
do
indeed
follow
up
on
thing
personally
if
elon
be
not
happy
you
knew
it
schmitz
say
thing
could
get
nasty
in
the
month
that
follow
that
meeting
spacex
increase
its
internal
weld
capability
so
that
it
could
make
the
fuel
tank
in
el
segundo
and
ditch
spincraft
another
salesman
flew
down
to
spacex
to
sell
the
company
on
some
technology
infrastructure
equipment
he
be

building

practice
by

for
century
show
up
speak
for
a

feel
each

out
then
start
do
business
down
the

musk
be
have
none
of
it
the
guy
come
in
and
elon
asks
him
why
they
re
meeting
spike
say
he
say
to
develop
a
relationship
elon
reply
okay
nice
to
meet
you
which
basically
meant
get
the
fuck
out
of
my
office
this
guy
have
spent
four
hour
travel
for
what
end
up
as
a
two
minute
meeting
elon
just
have
no
tolerance
for
that
kind
of
stuff
musk
could
be
equally
brisk
with
employee
who
be
not
hit
his
standard
he
would
often
say
the
longer
you
wait
to
fire
someone
the
longer
it
have
be
since
you
should
have
fire
them
spike
say
most
of
the
spacex
employee
be
thrill
to
be
part
of
the
company
s
adventure
and
try
not
to
let
musk
s
grueling
demand
and
harsh
behavior
get
to
them
but
there
be
some
moment
where
musk
go
too
far
the
engineering
corp
flew
into
a
collective
rage
every
time
they
caught
musk
in
the
press
claim
to
have
design
the
falcon
rocket
more
or
less
by
himself
musk
also
hire
a
documentary
crew
to
follow
him
around
for
a
while
this
audacious
gesture
really
grate
on
the
people
toil
away
in
the
spacex
factory
they
felt
like
musk
s
ego
have
gotten
the
best
of
him
and
that
he
be
present
spacex
as
the
conqueror
of
the
aerospace
industry
when
the
company
have
yet
to
launch
successfully
employee
who
make
detailed
case
around
what
they
saw
as
flaw
in
the
falcon
design
or
present
practical
suggestion
to
get
the
falcon
out
the
door
more
quickly
be
often
ignore
or
bad
the
treatment
of
staff
be
not
good
for
long
stretch
of
this
era
say
one
engineer
many
good
engineer
who
everyone
beside
management
felt
be
asset
to
the
company
be
force
out
or
simply
fire
outright
after
be
blame
for
thing
they
hadn
t
do
the
kiss
of
death
be
prove
elon
wrong
about
something
early
when
spacex
have
hop
to
launch
its
rocket
come
and
go
the
merlin
engine
that
mueller
and
his
team
have
built
appear
to
be
among
the
most
efficient
rocket
engine
ever
make
it
be
just
take
longer
than
musk
have
expect
to
pas
test
need
to
clear
the

for
a

finally
in
the
fall
of
the

be
burning
consistently
and
meeting
all
their
requirement
this
meant
that
mueller

his
team
could
breathe
easy
and
that
everyone
else
at
spacex
should
prepare

mueller
have
spent
spacex
s
entire

as
the

the

the

from
achieve
its
next
step
work
under
musk
s
scrutiny
with
the

ready
it
be
time
for
mass
panic
mueller
say
no
one
else
knew
what
it
be
like
to
be
on
critical
path
lot
of
people
soon
found
out
as
major
problem
abound
the
avionics
which
include
the
electronics
for
the
navigation
communication
and
overall
management
of
the
rocket
turn
into
a
nightmare
seemingly
trivial
thing
like
get
a
flash
storage
drive
to
talk
to
the
rocket
s
main
computer
fail
for
undetectable
reason
the
software
need
to
manage
the
rocket
also
become
a
major
burden
it
s
like
anything
else
where
you
find
out
that
the
last
ten
percent
be
where
all
the
integration
happens
and
thing
don
t
play
together
mueller
say
this
process
go
on
for
six
month
finally
in
may
spacex
transport
the
rocket
mile
north
to
vandenberg
air
force
base
for
a
test
fire
and
complete
a
five
second
burn
on
the
launchpad
launch
from
vandenberg
would
have
be
very
convenient
for
spacex
the
site
be
close
to
los
angeles
and
have
several
launchpad
to
pick
from
spacex
though
become
an
unwelcome
guest
the
air
force
give
the
newcomer
a
cool
welcome
and
the
people
assign
to
manage
the
launch
site
do
not
go
out
of
their
way
help
spacex
lockheed
and
boeing
which
fly
billion
spy
satellite
for
the
military
from
vandenberg
didn
t
care
for
spacex
s
presence
either
in
part
because
spacex
represent
a
threat
to
their
business
and
in
part
because
this
startup
be
muck
around
near
their
precious
cargo
as
spacex
start
to
move
from
the
test
phase
to
the
launch
it
be
told
to
get
in
line
they
would
have
to
wait
month
to
launch
even
though
they
say
we
could
fly
it
be
clear
that

give

the

any

that
the

the

transform

over
the

of
several
month
a
small
team
of
people
clear
the
brush
pour

to
support
the

and
convert
a

trailer
into

the

be
grueling
and
take
place
in
soul
sap
humidity
under
a

powerful
enough
to
burn
the

through
a

eventually
some
of
the

prefer
to
spend

on

rather
than
make

some
of
the

be
turn

hollman
say
then
we
ship
over
a
very
nice
refrigerator
and
a
good
grill
and
plumbed
in
a
shower
we
try
to
make
it
less

and
more
like
living
the

rise
at
a

each

and
that
s
when
the
spacex
team
get
to
work
a
series
of

would
take

with

listing

debate
solution
to
linger
problem
as
the

arrive
the

place
the
body
of
the

horizontally
in
a
makeshift
hangar
and
spent
hour
meld
together
all
of
its
part
there
be
always
something
to
do
hollman
say
if
the
engine
wasn
t
a
problem
then
there
be
an
avionics
problem
or
a
software
problem
by
p
m
the
engineer
wound
down
their
work
one
or
two
people
would
decide
it
be
their
night
to
cook
and
they
would
make
steak
and
potato
and
pasta
hollman
say
we
have
a
bunch
of
movie
and
a
dvd
player
and
some
of
us
do
a
lot
of
fishing
off
the
dock
for
many
of
the
engineer
this
be
both
a
torturous
and
magical
experience
at
boeing
you
could
be
comfortable
but
that
wasn
t
go
to
happen
at
spacex
say
walter
sims
a
spacex
tech
expert
who
found
time
to
get
certify
to
dive
while
on
kwaj
every
person
on
that
island
be
a
fuck
star
and
they
be
always
hold
seminar
on
radio
or
the
engine
it
be
such
an
invigorate
place
the
engineer
be
constantly
baffle
by
what
musk
would
fund
and
what
he
wouldn
t
back
at
headquarters
someone
would
ask
to
buy
a
machine
or
a
pricey
part
that
they
deem
essential
to
falcon
s
success
and
musk
would
deny
the
request
and
yet
he
be
totally
comfortable
pay
a
similar
amount
to
put
a
shiny
surface
on
the
factory
floor
to
make
it
look
nice
on
omelek
the
worker
want
to
pave
a
two
hundred
yard
pathway
between
the
hangar
and
the
launchpad
to
make
it
easy
to
transport
the
rocket
musk
refuse
this
left
the
engineer
move
the
rocket
and
its
wheel
support
structure
in
the
fashion
of
the
ancient
egyptian
they
laid
down
a
series
of
wooden
plank
and
roll
the
rocket
across
them
grab
the
last
piece
of
wood
from
the
back
and
run
it
forward
in
a
continuous
cycle
the
whole
situation
be
ludicrous
a
start
up
rocket
company
have
end
up
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
try
to
pull
off
one
of
the
most
difficult
feat
know
to
man
and
truth
be
told
only
a
handful
of
the
spacex
team
have
any
idea
how
to
make
a
launch
happen
time
and
again
the
rocket
would
get
march
out
to
the
launchpad
and
hoist
vertical
for
a
couple
of
day
while
technical
and
safety
check
would
reveal
a
litany
of
new
problem
the
engineer
work
on
the
rocket
for
as
long
as
they
could
before
lay
it
horizontal
and
march
it
back
to
the
hangar
to
avoid
damage
from
the
salty
air
team
that

the

be
an

hollman
say
in
november
about
six
month
after
they
have
first
gotten
to
the
island
the
spacex
team
felt
ready
to
give
launch
a
shot
musk
flew
in
with
his
brother
kimbal
and
join
the
majority
of
the
spacex
team
in
the
barrack
on
kwaj
on
november
a
handful
of
people
woke
up
at
a
m
and
fill
the
rocket
with
liquid
oxygen
they
then
scamper
off
to
an
island
about
three
mile
away
for
protection
while
the
rest
of
the
spacex
team
monitor
the
launch
system
from
a
control
room
twenty
six
mile
away
on
kwaj
the
military
give
spacex
a
six
hour
launch
window
everyone
be
hop
to
see
the
first
stage
take
off
and
reach
about
mile
per
hour
before
give
way
to
the
second
stage
which
would
ignite
up
in
the
air
and
reach
mile
per
hour
but
while
go
through
the
pre
launch
check
the
engineer
detect
a
major
problem
a
valve
on
a
liquid
oxygen
tank
would
not
close
and
the
lox
be
boil
off
into
the
air
at
gallon
per
hour
spacex
scramble
to
fix
the
issue
but
lose
too
much
of
its
fuel
to
launch
before
the
window
close
with
that
mission
aborted
spacex
order
major
lox
reinforcement
from
hawaii
and
prepared
for
another
attempt
in
mid
december
high
wind
faulty
valve
and
other
error
thwart
that
launch
attempt
before
another
attempt
could
be
make
spacex
discover
on
a
saturday
night
that
the
rocket
s
power
distribution
system
have
start
malfunction
and
would
need
new
capacitor
on
sunday
morning
the
rocket
be
lower
and
split
into
its
two
stage
so
that
a
technician
could
slide
in
and
remove
the
electrical
board
someone
found
an
electronics
supplier
that
be
open
on
sunday
in
minnesota
and
off
a
spacex
employee
flew
to
get
some
fresh
capacitor
by
monday
he
be
in
california
and
test
the
part
at
spacex
s
headquarters
to
make
sure
they
pass
various
heat
and
vibration
check
then
on
a
plane
again
back
to
the
island
in
under
eighty
hour
the
electronics
have
be
return
in
work
order
and
instal
in
the
rocket
the
dash
to
the
united
state
and
back
show
that
spacex
s
thirty
person
team
have
real
pluck
in
the
face
of
adversity
and
inspire
everyone
on
the
island
a
traditional
three
hundred
person
strong
aerospace
launch
crew
would
never
have
try
to
fix
a
rocket
like
that
on
the
fly
but
the
energy
smart
and
resourcefulness
of
the
spacex
team
still
could
not
overcome
their
inexperience
or
the
difficult
condition
more
problem
arose
and
block
any
thought
of
a
launch
finally
on
march
it
be
all
system
go
the
falcon
stood
on
its
square
launchpad
and
ignite
it
soar
into
the
sky
turn
the
island
below
it
into
a
green
spec
amid
a
vast
blue
expanse
in
the

musk
pace
as
he
watch
the
action
wear
short
flip
flop
and
a
t
shirt
then
about
twenty
five
second
in
it
become
clear
that
all
be
not
well
a
fire
broke
out
above
the
merlin
engine
and
suddenly
this
machine
that
have
be
fly
straight
and
true
start
to
spin
and
then
tumble
uncontrollably
back
to
earth
the
falcon
end
up
fall
directly
down
onto
the
launch
site
most
of
the
debris
go
into
a
reef
foot
from
the
launchpad
and
the
satellite
cargo
smash
through
spacex
s
machine
shop
roof
and
land
more
or
less
intact
on
the
floor
some
of
the
engineer
put
on
their
snorkel
and
scuba
gear
and
recover
the
piece
fitting
all
of
the
rocket
s
remnant
into
two
refrigerator
size
crate
it
be
perhaps
worth
note
that
those
launch
company
that
succeed
also
take
their
lump
along
the
way
musk
write
in
a

mine
write

remind
me
that

how

it

i
have
a

of
respect
for

we
be
go
to
make
this
work
musk
and
other
spacex
executive
blame
the
crash
on
an
unnamed
technician
they
say
this
technician
have
do
some
work
on
the
rocket
one
day
before
the
launch
and
fail
to
properly
tighten
a
fitting
on
a
fuel
pipe
which
cause
the
fitting
to
crack
the
fitting
in
question
be
something
basic
an
aluminum
b
nut
that
s
often
use
to
connect
a
pair
of
tube
the
technician
be
hollman
in
the
aftermath
of
the
rocket
crash
hollman
flew
to
los
angeles
to
confront
musk
directly
he
d
spent
year
work
day
and
night
on
the
falcon
and
felt
enrage
that
musk
have
call
out
him
and
his
team
in
public
hollman
knew
that
he
d
fasten
the
b
nut
correctly
and
that
observer
from
nasa
have
be
look
over
his
shoulder
to
check
the
work
when
hollman
charge
into
spacex
s
headquarters
with
a
head
full
of
fury
mary
beth
brown
try
to
calm
him
and
stop
him
from
see
musk
hollman
kept
go
anyway
and
the
two
of
them
proceed
to
have
a
shout
match
at
musk
s
cubicle
after
all
the
debris
be
analyze
it
turn
out
that
the
b
nut
have
almost
certainly
crack
due
to
corrosion
from
the
month
in
kwaj
s
salty
atmosphere
the
rocket
be
literally
crust
with
salt
on
one
side
and
you
have
to
scrape
it
off
mueller
say
but
we
have
do
a
static
fire
three
day
earlier
and
everything
be
fine
spacex
have
try
to
save
about
fifty
pound
of
weight
by
use
aluminum
component
instead
of
stainless
steel
thompson
the
former
marine
have
see
the
aluminum
part
work
just
fine
in
helicopter
that
sat
on
aircraft
carrier
and
mueller
have
see
aircraft
rest
outside
of
cape
canaveral
for
forty
year
with
aluminum
b
nut
in
fine
condition
year
later
a
number
of
spacex
s
executive
still
agonize
over
the
way
hollman
and
his
team
be
treat
they
be
our
best
guy
and
they
kind
of
get
blame
to
get
an
answer
out
to
the
world
mueller
say
that
be
really
bad
we
found
out
later
that
it
be
dumb
luck
after
the
crash
there
be
a
lot
of
drinking
at
a
bar
on
the
main
island
musk
want
to
launch
again
within
six
month
but
put
together
a
new
machine
would
again
require
an
immense
amount
of
work
spacex
have
some
piece
for
the
vehicle
ready
in
el
segundo
but
certainly
not
a
ready
to
fire
rocket
as
they
down
drink
the
engineer
vowed
to
take
a
more
discipline
approach
with
their
next
craft
and
to
work
well
as
a
collective

hop
the
spacex
engineer
would
raise
their
game
as
well
he
d
be
observe
them
for
the
defense
department
and
love
the
energy
of
the
young
engineer

not
their

after
the

blew
up

perform
an

for
the

huge

then
on

the

finally
behave
from
its
launchpad

by
palm
tree
the
falcon
surge
up
and
toward
space
it
flew
for
a
couple
of
minute
with

now
and
again
reporting
that
the

minute
into

next
at
the
four

exactly
what
it

to
do

mueller
i

next

we

make
it
we
re

and
believe
it
s
go
to
make
it
to
orbit
then
it
start
to
wiggle
for
more
than
five
glorious
minute
the
spacex
engineer
get
to
feel
like
they
have
do
everything
right
a
camera
on
board
the

point
down
and
show
earth
get
small
and
small
as
the
rocket
make
its
way
methodically
into
space
but
then
that
wiggle
that
mueller
notice
turn
into
flail
and
the
machine
swoon
start
to
break
apart
and
then
blew
up
this
time
the
spacex
engineer
be
quick
to
figure
out
what
go
wrong
as
the

to
move
around
the

the

at
one
point
it

when
the

out
the

close

forth
between

by
the
time

would
be
about
four
year
after

the

have
be
chew
through
his
internet
fortune
at
a
worry
rate
musk
have
vowed
publicly
that
he
would
see
this
thing
through
to
the
end
but
people
inside
and
outside
the
company
be
do
back
of
the
envelope
math
and
could
tell
that
spacex
likely
could
only
afford
one
more
attempt
maybe
two
to
the
extent
that
the
financial
situation
unnerved
musk
he
rarely
if
ever
let
it
show
to
employee
elon
do
a
great
job

not
burdening

the

of

it
be
never
if
we
fail

be
very
optimistic
the
failure
seem
to
do
little
to
curtail
musk

vision
for
the

or

about

aloud
about
how
the

that

through
the

to

always
take
something
apart
spruce
it
up

built
one

straubel

spirit
carry
him
west
to
stanford
university
where
he
enrol
in
intend
to
become
a
physicist
after
fly
through
the
hardest
course
he
could
take
straubel
conclude
that
major
in
physic
would
not
be
for
him
the
advanced
course
be
too
theoretical
and
straubel
like
to
get
his
hand
dirty
he
developed
his
own
major
call
energy
system
and
engineering
i
want
to
take
software
and
electricity
and
use
it
to
control
energy
straubel
say
it
be
compute
combine
with
power
electronics
i
collect
all
the
thing
i
love
do
in
one
place
there
be
no
clean
technology
movement
at
this
time
but
there
be
company
dabble
with
new
us
for
solar
power
and
electric
vehicle
straubel
end
up
hunt
down
these
startup
hang
out
in
their
garage
and
pester
the
engineer
he
begin
tinker
once
again
on
his
own
as
well
in
the
garage
of
a
house
he
share
with
a
half
dozen
friend
straubel
bought
a
piece
of
shit
porsche
for
and
turn
it
into
an
electric
car
this
meant
that
straubel
have
to
create
a
controller
to
manage
the
electric
motor
build
a
charger
from
scratch
and
write
the
software
that
make
the
entire
machine
work
the
car
set
the
world
record
for
electric
vehicle
ev
acceleration
travel
a
quarter
mile
in
second
the
thing
i
take
away
be
that
the
electronics
be
great
and
you
could
get
acceleration
on
a
shoestring
budget
but
the
battery
suck
straubel
say
it
have
a
thirty
mile
range
so
i
learn
firsthand
about
some
of
the
limitation
of
electric
vehicle
straubel
give
his
car
a
hybrid
boost
building
a
gasoline
power
contraption
that
could
be
towed
behind
the
porsche
and
use
to
recharge
the
battery
it
be
good
enough
for
straubel
to
drive
the
four
hundred
mile
down
to
los
angeles
and
back
by
straubel
be
living
in
los
angeles
he
d
gotten
a
master
s
degree
from
stanford
and
bounce
around
a
couple
of
company
look
for
something
that
call
out
to
him
he
decide
on
rosen
motor
which
have
built
one
of
the
world
s
first
hybrid
vehicle
a
car
that
ran
off
a
flywheel
and
a
gas
turbine
and
have
electric
motor
to
drive
the
wheel
after
it
fold
straubel
follow
harold
rosen
an
engineer
famed
for
invent
the
geostationary
satellite
to
create
an
electric
plane
i
m
a
pilot
and
love
to
fly
so
this
be
perfect
for
me
straubel
say
the
idea
be
that
it
would
stay
aloft
for
two
week
at
a
time
and
hover
over
a
specific
spot
this
be
way
before
drone
and
all
that
to
help
make
end
meet
straubel
also
work
night
and
on
the
weekend
do
electronics
consult
for
a
start
up
it
be
in
the
midst
of
toil
away
on
all
these
project
that
straubel
s
old
buddy
from
the
stanford
solar
car
team
come
to
pay
him
a
visit
a

of
rogue
engineer
at
stanford
have
be
work
on

for

building
them
in
a
world
war
ii
era
quonset
hut
full
of
toxic
chemical
and
black

unlike
today
when

would

such
a

stanford
try

shut
down
this

do
the

race
straubel
help
build
the
vehicle
during
his
time
at
university
and
even
after
form
relationship
with
the
incoming
crop
of
engineer
the
team
have
just
race
mile
from
chicago
to
los

and
straubel
offer
the
strap
exhaust
kid
a
place
to
stay
about
a
half
dozen
student
show
up
at
straubel
s
place
take
their
first
shower
in
many
day
and
then
spread
across
his
floor
as
they
chat
late
into
the
night
straubel
and
the
solar
team
kept
fixate
on
one
topic
they
realize
that
lithium
ion
battery
such
as
the
one
in
their
car
be
fed
by
the
sun
have
gotten
much
well
than
most
people
realize
many
consumer
electronics
device
like
laptop
be
run
on
so
call
lithium
ion
battery
which
look
a
lot
like
aa
battery
and
could
be
strung
together
we
wonder
what
would
happen
if
you
put
ten
thousand
of
the
battery
cell
together
straubel
say
we
do
the
math
and
figure
you
could
go
almost
one
thousand
mile
it
be
totally
nerdy
shit
and
eventually
everyone
fell
asleep
but
the
idea
really
stuck
with
me
soon
enough
straubel
be
stalk
the
solar
car
crew
try
to
talk
them
into
building
an
electric
car
base
on
the
lithium
ion
battery
he
would
fly
up
to
palo
alto
spend
the
night
sleep
in
his
plane
and
then
ride
a
bicycle
to
the
stanford
campus
to
make
his
sale
pitch
while
help
with
their
current
project
the
design
straubel
have
come
up
with
be
a
super
aerodynamic
vehicle
with
percent
of
its
mass
make
up
of
the
battery
it
look
quite
a
bit
like
a
torpedo
on
wheel
no
one
knew
the
exact
detail
of
straubel
s
long
term
vision
for
this
thing
include
straubel
the
plan
seem
to
be
less
about
form
a
car
company
than
about
building
a
proof
of
concept
vehicle
just
to
get
people
think
about
the
power
of
the
lithium
ion
battery
with
any
luck
they
would
find
a
race
to
compete
in
the
stanford
student
agree
to
join
straubel
if
he
could
raise
some
money
he
begin
go
to
trade
show
hand
out
brochure
about
his
idea
and
e
mail
just
about
anyone
he
could
think
of
i
be
shameless
he
say
the
only
problem
be
that
no
one
have
any
interest
in
what
straubel
be
sell
investor
dealt
him
one
rejection
after
another
for
month
on
end
then
in
the
fall
of
straubel
met
elon
musk
harold
rosen
have
set
up
a
lunch
with
musk
at
a
seafood
restaurant
near
the
spacex
headquarters
in
los
angeles
and
brought
straubel
along
to
help
talk
up
the
electric
plane
idea
when
musk
didn
t
bite
on
that
straubel
announce
his
electric
car
side
project
the
crazy
idea
struck
an
immediate
chord
with
musk
who
have
be
think
about
electric
vehicle
for
year
while
musk
have
mostly
focus
on
use
ultracapacitors
for
the

he
be
thrill
and
surprised
to
hear
how
far
the
lithium
ion
battery
technology
have
progress
everyone
else
have
told
me
i
be
nut
but
elon
love
the
idea
straubel
say
he
say
sure
i
will
give
you
some
money
musk
promise
straubel
of
the
he
be
seek
on
the
spot
musk
and
straubel
form
a
kinship
that
would
survive
more
than
a
decade
of
extreme
high
and
low
as
they
set
out
to
do
nothing
less
than
change
the
world
after
the
meeting
with
musk
straubel
reach
out
to
his
friend
at
ac

the
los
angeles
base
company
start
in
and
be
the
bleeding
edge
of

building
everything
from
zippy
midsize
passenger
job
right
on
up
to
sport
car
straubel
really
want
to
show
musk
the
tzero
from
t
zero
the
high
end
vehicle
in
ac
propulsion
s
stable
it
be
a
type
of
kit
car
that
have
a
fiberglass
body
sit
on
top
of
a
steel
frame
and
go
from
zero
to
mile
per
hour
in
second
when
first
unveiled
in
straubel
have
spent
year
hang
out
with
the
ac

ask
tom
gage
the
company
s
president
to
bring
a
tzero
over
for
musk
to
drive
musk
fell
for
the
car
he
saw
its
potential
as
a
scream
fast
machine
that
could
shift
the
perception
of
electric
car
from
boring
and
plod
to
something
aspirational
for
month
musk
offer
to
fund
an
effort
to
transform
the
kit
car
into
a
commercial
vehicle
but
get
rebuffed
time
and
again
it
be
a
proof
of
concept
and
need
to
be
make
real
straubel
say
i
love
the
hell
out
of
the
ac
propulsion
guy
but
they
be
sort
of
hopeless
at
business
and
refuse
to
do
it
they
kept
try
to
sell
elon
on
this
car
call
the
ebox
that
look
like
shit
didn
t
have
good
performance
and
be
just
uninspiring
while
the
meeting
with
ac
propulsion
didn
t
result
in
a
deal
they
have
solidify
musk
s
interest
in
backing
something
well
beyond
straubel
s
science
project
in
a
late
february
e
mail
to

write
what
i

go
to

be
figure
out
the
best
choice
of
a
high
performance
base
car
and
electric
powertrain
and
go
in
that
direction
unbeknownst
to
straubel
at
about
the
same
time
a
couple
of
business
partner
in
northern
california
have
also
fall
in
love
with
the
idea
of
make

car
martin
eberhard
and
marc
tarpenning

found
nuvomedia
in

one
of
the
early
electronic
book
reader
call
the

ebook
the
work
at
nuvomedia
have
give
the
men
insight
into
cut
edge
consumer
electronics
and
the
hugely
improve
lithium
ion
battery
use
to
power
laptop
and
other
portable
device
while
the
rocket
ebook
be
too
far
ahead
of
its
time
and
not
a
major
commercial
success
it
be
innovative
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
gemstar
international
group
which
own
tv
guide
and
some
electronic
program
guide
technology
gemstar
paid
million
to
acquire
nuvomedia
in
march
spoil
in

the
cofounder
stayed
in
touch
after
the
deal
they
both
live
in
woodside
one
of
the
wealthy
town
in
silicon
valley
and
chat
from
time
to
time
about
what
they
should
tackle
next
we
thought
up
some
goofball
thing
say
tarpenning
there
be
one
plan
for
these
fancy
irrigation
system
for
farm
and
the
home
base
on
smart
water
sense
network
but
nothing
really
resonate
and
we
want
something
more
important
eberhard
be
a
supremely
talented
engineer
with
a
do
gooder
s
social
conscience
the
united
state
repeat
conflict
in
the
middle
east
bother
him
and
like
many
other
science
mind
folk
around
he
have
start
to
accept
global
warm
as
a
reality
eberhard
begin
look
for
alternative
to
gas
guzzle
car
he
investigate
the
potential
of
hydrogen
fuel
cell
but
found
them
lack
he
also
didn
t
see
much
point
in
lease
something
like
the
ev
electric
car
from
general
motor
what
do
catch
eberhard
s
interest
however
be
the
all
electric
car
from
ac
propulsion
that
he
spy
on
the
internet
eberhard
go
down
to
los
angeles
around
to
visit
the
ac
propulsion
shop
the
place
look
like
a
ghost
town
and
like
they
be
go
out
of
business
eberhard
say
i
bail
them
out
with
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
so
that
they
could
build
one
of
their
car
for
me
with
lithium
ion
instead
of
lead
acid
battery
eberhard
too
try
to
goad
ac
propulsion
into
be
a
commercial
enterprise
rather
than
a
hobby
shop
when
they
reject
his
overture
eberhard
decide
to
form
his
own
company
and
see
what
the
lithium
ion
battery
could
really
do
eberhard
s
journey
begin
with
him
building
a
technical
model
of
the
electric
car
on
a
spreadsheet
this
let
him
tweak
various
component
and
see
how
they
might
affect
the
vehicle
s
shape
and
performance
he
could
adjust
the
weight
number
of
battery
resistance
of
the
tire
and
body
and
then
get
back
answer
on
how
many
battery
it
would
take
to
power
the
various
design
the
model
make
it
clear
that
suv
which
be
very
popular
at
the
time
and
thing
like
delivery
truck
be
unlikely
candidate
the
technology
seem
instead
to
favor
a
lighter
weight
high
end
sport
car
which
would
be
fast
fun
to
drive
and
have
far
well
range
than
most
people
would
expect
these
technical
specification
complement
the
finding
of
tarpenning
who
have
be
do
research
into
a
financial
model
for
the
car
the
toyota
prius
have
start
to
take
off
in
california
and
it
be
be
purchase
by
wealthy
eco
crusader
we
also
learn
that
the
average
income
for
ev
owner
be
around
two
hundred
thousand
dollar
per
year
tarpenning
say
people
who
use
to
go
after
the
lexus
bmw
and
cadillac
brand
saw
electric
and
hybrid
car
as
a
different
kind
of
status
symbol
the
men
figure
they
could
build
something
for
the
billion
per
year
luxury
auto
market
in
the
united
state
that
would
let
rich
people
have
fun
and
feel
good
about
themselves
too
people
pay
for
cool
and
sexy
and
an
amaze
zero
to
sixty
time
tarpenning
say
on
july
eberhard
and
tarpenning
incorporate
their
new
company
while
at
disneyland
a
few
month
earlier
on
a
date
with
his
wife
eberhard
have
come
up
with
the
name
tesla
motor
both
to
pay
homage
to
the
inventor
and
electric
motor
pioneer
nikola
tesla
and
because
it
sound
cool
the
cofounder
rent
an
office
that
have
three
desk
and
two
small
room
in
a
decrepit
s
building
locate
at
oak
grove
avenue
in
menlo
park
the
third
desk
be
occupy
a
few
month
later
by
ian
wright
an
engineer
who
grow
up
on
a
farm
in
new
zealand
he
be
a
neighbor
of
the
tesla
cofounder
in
woodside
and
have
be
work
with
them
to
hone
his
pitch
for
a
networking
startup
when
the
start
up
fail
to
raise
any
money
from
venture
capitalist
wright
join
tesla
as
the
three
men
begin
to
tell
some
of
their
confidant
of
their
plan
they
be
confront
with
universal
derision
we
met
a
friend
at
this
woodside
pub
to
tell
her
what
we
have
finally
decide
to
do
and
that
it
be
go
to
be
an
electric
car
tarpenning
say
she
say
you
have
to
be
kid
me
anyone
who
try
to
build
a
car
company
in
the
united
state
be
quickly
remind
that
the
last
successful
start
up
in
the
industry
be
chrysler
found
in
design
and
building
a
car
from
the
ground
up
come
with
plenty
of
challenge
but
it
s
really
get
the
money
and
know
how
to
build
lot
of
car
that
have
thwart
past
effort
to
get
a
new
company
go
the
tesla
founder
be
aware
of
these
reality
they
figure
that
nikola
tesla
have
built
an
electric
motor
a
century
earlier
and
that
create
a
drivetrain
to
take
the
power
from
the
motor
and
send
it
to
the
wheel
be
doable
the
really
frighten
part
of
their
enterprise
would
be
building
the
factory
to
make
the
car
and
its
associate
part
but
the
more
the
tesla
guy
research
the
industry
the
more
they
realize
that
the
big
automaker
don
t
even
really
build
their
car
anymore
the
day
of
henry
ford
have
raw
material
deliver
to
one
end
of
his
michigan
factory
and
then
send
car
out
the
other
end
have
long
pass
bmw
didn
t
make
its
windshield
or
upholstery
or
rearview
mirror
tarpenning
say
the
only
thing
the
big
car
company
have
kept
be
internal
combustion
research
sale
and
marketing
and
the
final
assembly
we
thought
na
vely
that
we
could
access
all
the
same
supplier
for
our
part
the
plan
the
tesla
cofounder
come
up
with
be
to
license
some
technology
from
ac
propulsion
around
the
tzero
vehicle
and
to
use
the
lotus
elise
chassis
for
the
body
of
their
car
lotus
the
english
carmaker
have
release
the
two
door
elise
in
and
it
certainly
have
the
sleek
ground
hug
appeal
to
make
a
statement
to
high
end
car
buyer
after
talk
to
a
number
of
people
in
the
car
dealership
business
the
tesla
team
decide
to
avoid
sell
their
car
through
partner
and
sell
direct
with
these
basic
of
a
plan
in
place
the
three
men
go
hunt
for
some
venture
capital
funding
in
january
to
make
thing
feel
more
real
for
the
investor
the
tesla
founder
borrow
a
tzero
from
ac
propulsion
and
drove
it
to
the
venture
capital
corridor
of
sand
hill
road
the
car
accelerate
faster
than
a
ferrari
and
this
translate
into
visceral
excitement
for
the
investor
the
downside
though
be
that
venture
capitalist
be
not
a
terribly
imaginative
bunch
and
they
struggle
to
see
past
the
crappy
plastic
finish
of
this
glorify
kit
car
the
only
venture
capitalist
that
bit
be
compass
technology
partner
and
sdl
venture
and
they
didn
t
sound
altogether
thrill
the
lead
partner
at
compass
have
make
out
well
on
nuvomedia
and
felt
some
loyalty
to
eberhard
and
tarpenning
he
say
this
be
stupid
but
i
have
invest
in
every
automotive
start
up
for
the
last
forty
year
so
why
not
tarpenning
recall
tesla
still
need
a
lead
investor
who
would
pony
up
the
bulk
of
the
million
need
to
make
what
s
know
as
a
mule
or
a
prototype
vehicle
that
would
be
their
first
milestone
and
give
them
something
physical
to
show
off
which
could
aid
a
second
round
of
funding
eberhard
and
tarpenning
have
elon
musk
s
name
in
the
back
of
their
head
as
a
possible
lead
investor
from
the
outset
they
have
both
see
him
speak
a
couple
of
year
earlier
at
a
mar
society
conference
held
at
stanford
where
musk
have
laid
out
his
vision
of
send
mouse
into
space
and
they
get
the
impression
that
he
thought
a
bit
differently
and
would
be
open
to
the
idea
of
an
electric
car
the
idea
to
pitch
musk
on
tesla
motor
solidify
when
tom
gage
from
ac
propulsion
call
eberhard
and
told
him
that
musk
be
look
to
fund
something
in
the
electric
car
arena
eberhard
and
wright
flew
down
to
los
angeles
and
met
with
musk
on
a
friday
that
weekend
musk
pepper
tarpenning
who
have
be
away
on
a
trip
with
question
about
the
financial
model
i
just
remember
respond
respond
and
respond
tarpenning
say
the
follow
monday
martin
and
i
flew
down
to
meet
him
again
and
he
say
okay
i
m
in
the
tesla
founder
felt
like
they
have
lucked
into
the
perfect
investor
musk
have
the
engineering
smart
to
know
what
they
be
building
he
also
share
their
large
goal
of
try
to
end
the
united
state
addiction
to
oil
you
need
angel
investor
to
have
some
belief
and
it
wasn
t
a
purely
financial
transaction
for
him
tarpenning
say
he
want
to
change
the
energy
equation
of
the
country
with
an
investment
of
million
musk
have
become
the
large
shareholder
of
tesla
and
the
chairman
of
the
company
musk
would
later
wield
his
position
of
strength
well
while
battling
eberhard
for
control
of
tesla
it
be
a
mistake
eberhard
say
i
want
more
investor
but
if
i
have
to
do
it
again
i
would
take
his
money
a
bird
in
the
hand
you
know
we
need
it
not
long
after
this
meeting
take
place
musk
call
straubel
and
urge
him
to
meet
with
the
tesla
team
straubel
heard
that
their
office
in
menlo
park
be
about
a
half
a
mile
from
his
house
and
he
be
intrigue
but
very
skeptical
of
their
story
no
one
on
the
planet
be
more
dial
into
the
electric
vehicle
scene
than
straubel
and
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
couple
of
guy
have
gotten
this
far
along
without
word
of
their
project
reach
him
nonetheless
straubel
stop
by
the
office
for
a
meeting
and
be
hire
right
away
in
may
at
a
salary
of
per
year
i
told
them
that
i
have
be
building
the
battery
pack
they
need
down
the
street
with
funding
from
elon
straubel
say
we
agree
to
join
force
and
form
this
ragtag
group
have
anyone
from
detroit
stop
by
tesla
motor
at
this
point
they
would
have
end
up
in
hysteric
the
sum
total
of
the
company
s
automotive
expertise
be
that
a
couple
of
the
guy
at
tesla
really
like
car
and
another
one
have
create
a
series
of
science
fair
project
base
on
technology
that
the
automotive
industry
consider
ridiculous
what
s
more
the
found
team
have
no
intention
of
turn
to
detroit
for
advice
on
how
to
build
a
car
company
no
tesla
would
do
what
every
other
silicon
valley
start
up
have
do
before
it
which
be
hire
a
bunch
of
young
hungry
engineer
and
figure
thing
out
as
they
go
along
never
mind
that
the
bay
area
have
no
real
history
of
this
model
ever
have
work
for
something
like
a
car
and
that
building
a
complex
physical
object
have
little
in
common
with
write
a
software
application
what
tesla
do
have
ahead
of
anyone
else
be
the
realization
that
lithium
ion
battery
have
gotten
really
good
and
be
go
to
keep
get
well
hopefully
that
couple
with
some
effort
and
smart
would
be
enough
straubel
have
a
direct
pipeline
into
the
smart
energetic
engineer
at
stanford
and
told
them
about
tesla
gene
berdichevsky
one
of
the
member
of
the
solar
power
car
team
lit
up
the
second
he
heard
from
straubel
an
undergraduate
berdichevsky
volunteer
to
quit
school
work
for
free
and
sweep
the
floor
at
tesla
if
that
s
what
it
take
to
get
a
job
the
founder
be
impressed
with
his
spirit
and
hire
berdichevsky
after
one
meeting
this
left
berdichevsky
in
the
uncomfortable
position
of
call
his
russian
immigrant
parent
a
pair
of
nuclear
submarine
engineer
to
tell
them
that
he
be
give
up
on
stanford
to
join
an
electric
car
start
up
as
employee
no
he
spent
part
of
the
workday
in
the
menlo
park
office
and
the
rest
in
straubel
s
living
room
design
three
dimensional
model
of
the
car
s
powertrain
on
a
computer
and
building
battery
pack
prototype
in
the
garage
only
now
do
i
realize
how
insane
it
be
berdichevsky
say
tesla
soon
need
to
expand
to
accommodate
its
budding
engineer
army
and
to
create
a
workshop
that
would
help
bring
the
roadster
as
they
be
now
call
the
car
to
life
they
found
a
two
story
industrial
building
in
san
carlos
at
commercial
street
the
square
foot

wasn

much
but
it
have
room
to
build
a
research
and
development
shop
capable
of
knock
out
some
prototype

there
be
a
couple
of
large
assembly

on
the
ride

of

and
final
assembly
the
left
half
of
the

be
an

that
have
be
modify
in
weird
way
by
the
previous
tenant
a
plumbing

the

be
wing
berdichevsky
paint
the

white
on
a
sunday
night
and
the
next
week
the
employee
make
a

trip
to

to
buy
desk
and
hopped
online
to
order
their

from

as
for

tesla
have
a
single
craftsman
toolbox
load
with
hammer
nail
and
other
carpentry
basic
musk
would
visit
now
and
again
from
los

and
be
unfazed
by
the
condition
have
see
spacex
grow
up
in
similar
surroundings
the
original
plan
for
produce
a

vehicle
sound
simple
tesla
would
take
the
ac
propulsion
tzero
powertrain
and
fit
it
into
the
lotus
elise
body
the
company
have
acquire
a
schematic
for
an
electric

figure
it
could
buy
a
transmission
from
a
company
in
the
united
state
or
europe
and
outsource
any
other
part
from

tesla
s
engineer
mostly
need
to
focus
on
develop
the
battery
pack
system
wiring
the

and
cut
and
weld
metal
as
need
to
bring
everything
together
engineer
love
to
muck
around
with
hardware
and
the
tesla
team
thought
of
the
roadster
as
something
akin
to
a
car
conversion
project
that
could
be
do
with
two
or
three
mechanical
engineer
and
a
few
assembly
people
the
main
team
of
prototype
builder
consist
of
straubel
berdichevsky
and
david
lyon
a
very
clever
mechanical
engineer
and
employee
no
lyon
have
about
a
decade
of
experience
work
for
silicon
valley
company
and
have
met
straubel
a
few
year
before
when
the
two
men
struck
up
a
conversation
at
a
eleven
about
an
electric
bike
straubel
be
rid
lyon
have
help
straubel
pay
bill
by
hire
him
as
a
consultant
for
a
company
building
a
device
to
measure
people
s
core
body
temperature
straubel
thought
he
could
return
the
favor
by
bring
lyon
on
early
to
such
an
excite
project
tesla
would
benefit
in
a
big
way
as
well
as
berdichevsky
put
it
dave
lyon
knew
how
to
get
shit
do
the
engineer
bought
a
blue
lift
for
the
car
and
set
it
up
inside
the
building
they
also
purchase
some
machine
tool
hand
tool
and
floodlight
to
work
at
night
and
start
to
turn
the
facility
into
a
hotbed
of
r
d
activity
electrical
engineer
study
the
lotus
s
base
level
software
to
figure
out
how
it
tie
together
the
pedal
mechanical
apparatus
and
the
dashboard
gauge
the
really
advanced
work
take
place
with
the
battery
pack
design
no
one
have
ever
try
to
combine
hundred
of
lithium
ion
battery
in
parallel
so
tesla
end
up
at
the
cut
edge
of
the
technology
the
engineer
start
try
to
understand
how
heat
would
dissipate
and
current
flow
would
behave
across
seventy
battery
by
supergluing
them
together
into
group
call
brick
then
ten
brick
would
be
place
together
and
the
engineer
would
test
various
type
of
air
and
liquid
cool
mechanism
when
the
tesla
team
have
developed
a
workable
battery
pack
they
stretch
the
yellow
lotus
elise
chassis
five
inch
and
lower
the
pack
with
a
crane
into
the
back
of
the
car
where
its
engine
would
normally
be
these
effort
begin
in
earnest
on
october
and
rather
remarkably
four
month
later
on
january
an
entirely
new
kind
of
car
have
be
built
by
eighteen
people
it
could
even
be
driven
around
tesla
have
a
board
meeting
that
day
and
musk
zipped
about
in
the
car
he
come
away
happy
enough
to
keep
invest
musk
put
in
million
more
as
tesla
raise
a
million
funding
round
the
company
now
plan
to
deliver
the
roadster
to
consumer
in
early
once
they
d
finish
building
a
second
car
a
few
month
later
the
engineer
at
tesla
decide
they
need
to
face
up
to
a
massive
potential
flaw
in
their
electric
vehicle
on
july
they
be
at
eberhard
s
house
in
woodside
celebrate
independence
day
and
figure
it
be
as
good
a
moment
as
any
to
see
what
happen
when
the
roadster
s
battery
caught
on
fire
someone
taped
twenty
of
the
battery
together
put
a
heating
strip
wire
into
the
bundle
and
set
it
off
it
go
up
like
a
cluster
of
bottle
rocket
lyon
say
instead
of
twenty
battery
the
roadster
would
have
close
to
and
the
thought
of
what
an
explosion
at
that
scale
would
be
like
horrify
the
engineer
one
of
the
perk
of
an
electric
car
be
meant
to
be
that
it
move
people
away
from
a
flammable
liquid
like
gasoline
and
the
endless
explosion
that
take
place
in
an
engine
rich
people
be
unlikely
to
pay
a
high
price
for
something
even
more
dangerous
and
the
early
nightmare
scenario
for
the
employee
at
tesla
be
that
a
rich
famous
person
would
get
caught
in
a
fire
cause
by
the
car
it
be
one
of
those
oh
shit
moment
lyon
say
that
be
when
we
really
sober
up
tesla
form
a
six
person
task
force
to
deal
with
the
battery
issue
they
be
pull
off
all
other
work
and
give
money
to
begin
run
experiment
the
first
explosion
start
take
place
at
the
tesla
headquarters
where
the
engineer
film
them
in
slow
motion
once
saner
mind
prevail
tesla
move
its
explosion
research
to
a
blast
area
behind
an
electrical
substation
maintain
by
the
fire
department
blast
by
blast
the
engineer
learn
a
great
deal
about
the
inner
working
of
the
battery
they
developed
method
for
arrange
them
in
way
that
would
prevent
fire
spread
from
one
battery
to
the
next
and
other
technique
for
stop
explosion
altogether
thousand
of
battery
explode
along
the
way
and
the
effort
be
worth
it
it
be
still
early
day
for
sure
but
tesla
be
on
the
verge
of
invent
battery
technology
that
would
set
it
apart
from
rival
for
year
to
come
and
would
become
one
of
the
company
s
great
advantage
the
early
success
at
building
two
prototype
car
couple
with
tesla
s
engineering
breakthrough
around
the
battery
and
other
technological
piece
boost
the
company
s
confidence
it
be
time
to
put
tesla
s
stamp
on
the
vehicle
the
original
plan
have
be
to
do
the
bare
minimum
we
could
get
away
with
as
far
as
make
the
car
stylistically
different
from
a
lotus
but
electric
say
tarpenning
along
the
way
elon
and
the
rest
of
the
board
say
you
only
get
to
do
this
once
it
have
to
delight
the
customer
and
the
lotus
just
isn
t
good
enough
to
do
that
the
elise
s
chassis
or
base
frame
work
fine
for
tesla
s
engineering
purpose
but
the
body
of
the
car
have
serious
issue
in
both
form
and
function
the
door
on
the
elise
be
all
of
a
foot
tall
and
you
be
meant
to
either
jump
into
the
car
or
fall
into
it
depend
on
your
flexibility
and
or
dignity
the
body
also
need
to
be
longer
to
accommodate
tesla
s
battery
pack
and
a
trunk
and
tesla
prefer
to
make
the
roadster
out
of
carbon
fiber
instead
of
fiberglass
on
these
design
point
musk
have
a
lot
of
opinion
and
influence
he
want
a
car
that
justine
could
feel
comfortable
get
into
and
that
have
some
measure
of
practicality
musk
make
these
opinion
clear
when
he
visit
tesla
for
board
meeting
and
design
review
tesla
hire
a
handful
of
designer
to
mock
up
new
look
for
the
roadster
after
settle
on
a
favorite
the
company
paid
to
build
a
quarter
scale
model
of
the
vehicle
in
january
and
then
a
full
scale
model
in
april
this
process
provide
the
tesla
executive
with
yet
another
revelation
of
everything
that
go
into
make
a
car
they
wrap
this
shiny
mylar
material
around
the
model
and
vacuum
it
so
that
you
can
really
see
the
contour
and
shine
and
shadow
tarpenning
say
the
silver
model
be
then
turn
into
a
digital
render
that
the
engineer
could
manipulate
on
their
computer
a
british
company
take
the
digital
file
and
use
it
to
create
a
plastic
version
of
the
car
call

another
test
procedure
require
that
the

go
into

the

opt

rent
an

truck
with
a

someone
would
drive
a

don

interact
with

it
receive

can
do

tesla
try

lease
a
small
office
in
detroit
the
cost
be
incredibly
low
compare
with
space
in

but
the
city
s
bureaucracy
make
get
just
a
basic

an
ordeal
the

s
owner
want
to
see
seven
year
of
audit
financials
from
tesla
which
be

then
the

want
two

tesla
have
about
million
in
the

could
have

you
say
you
re
back
by
a
venture
capitalist
and
that
s
the
end
of
the
negotiation
tarpenning
say
but
everything
be
like
that
in
detroit
we
d
get
fedex
box
and
they
couldn
t
even
decide
who
should
sign
for
the
package
throughout
these
early
year
the

credit
eberhard
with
make
quick
crisp
decision
rarely
do
tesla
get
hung
up
overanalyzing
a
situation
the
company
would
pick
a
plan
of
attack
and
when
it
fail
at
something
it
fail
fast
and
then
try
a
new
approach
it
be
many
of
the
change
that
musk
want
that
start
to
delay
the

musk
kept
push
for
the

he
push

that

with
the

eberhard
grouse
that
these
feature
be
slow
the
company
down
and
many
of
the

agree
it

at
time

berdichevsky
the

he
be
there
all

the

seem
to

pull
off
the
impossible
it
have
produce
the
fast
most
beautiful
electric
car
the
world
have
ever
see
almost
from
thin
air
all
it
have
to
do
next
be
build
a
lot
of
the
car
a
process
that
would
end
up
almost
bankrupting
the
company
the
great
mistake
tesla
s
executive
make
in
the
early
day
be
assumption
around
the
transmission
system
for
the
roadster
the
goal
have
always
be
to
get
from
zero
to
mph
as
quickly
as
possible
in
the
hope
that
the
raw
speed
of
the
roadster
would
attract
a
lot
of
attention
and
make
it
fun
to
drive
to
do
this
tesla
s
engineer
have
decide
on
a
two
speed
transmission
which
be
the
underlie
mechanism
in
the
car
for
transfer
power
from
the
motor
to
the
wheel
the
first
gear
would
take
the
car
from
zero
to
mph
in
less
than
four
second
and
then
the
second
gear
would
take
the
car
up
to
mph
tesla
have
hire
xtrac
a
british
company
specialize
in
transmission
design
to
build
this
part
and
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
this
would
be
one
of
the
smoother
bit
of
the
roadster
s
journey
people
have
be
make
transmission
since
robert
fulton
built
the
steam
engine

bill
currie
a
veteran
silicon
valley
engineer
and
employee
no
at
tesla
we
thought
you
would
just
order
one
but
the
first
one
we
have
last
forty
second
the
initial
transmission
could
not
handle
the
big
jump
from
the
first
to
the
second
gear
and
the
fear
be
that
the
second
gear
would
engage
at
high
speed
and
not
be
synchronize
with
the
motor
properly
which
would
result
in
catastrophic
damage
to
the
car
lyon
and
the
other
engineer
quickly
set
out
to
try
to
fix
the
issue
they
found
a
couple
of
other
contractor
to
design
replacement
and
again
hop
that
these
longtime
transmission
expert
would
deliver
something
usable
with
relative
ease
it
soon
become
apparent
however
that
the
contractor
be
not
always
put
their
a
team
to
work
on
this
project
for
a
tiny
start
up
in
silicon
valley
and
that
the
new
transmission
be
no
well
than
the
first
during
test
tesla
found
that
the
transmission
would
sometimes
break
after
mile
and
that
the
mean
time
between
failure
be
about
mile
when
a
team
from
detroit
ran
a
root
cause
analysis
of
the
transmission
to
find

break
tesla
have
want
to
deliver
the
roadster
in
november
but
the
transmission
issue
linger
and
by
the
time
january
roll
around
the
company
have
to
once

start
from

push
tesla
also
face
issue
abroad
the
company
have
decide
to
send
a
team
of
its
young
most
energetic
engineer
to
thailand
to
set
up
a
battery
factory
tesla
partner
with
an
enthusiastic
although
not
totally
capable
manufacturing
partner
the
tesla
engineer
have
be
told
that
they
could
fly
over
and
manage
the
construction
of
a
state
of
the
art
battery
factory
instead
of
a
factory
they
found
a
concrete
slab
with
post
hold
up
a
roof
the
building
be
about
a
three
hour
drive
south
from
bangkok
and
have
be
left
mostly
open
like
many
of
the
other
factory
because
of
the
incredible
heat
the
other
manufacturing
operation
dealt
with
make
stove
tire
and
commodity
that
could
withstand
the
element
tesla
have
sensitive
battery
and
electronics
and
like
part
of
the
falcon
they
d
be
chewed
up
by
the
salty
humid
condition
eventually
tesla
s
partner
paid
about
to
put
in
drywall
coat
the
floor
and
create
storage
room

the

pack
which
have
to

be
take

to

where
they

ship
the
roadster
by
boat
around
cape
horn
to
los

in
that
scenario
tesla
would
have
paid
for
the
bulk
of
the
car
and
have
no
chance
to
recognize
revenue
on
the
part
until
six
to
nine
month
have
pass
the
idea
be
to
get
to
asia
get
thing
do
fast
and
cheap
and
make
money
on
the
car
say
forrest
north
one
of
the
engineer
sent
to
thailand
what
we
found
out
be
that
for
really
complicate
thing
you
can
do
the
work
cheaper
here
and
have
less
delay
and
less
problem
when
some
new
hire
come
on
they
be
horrify
to
discover
just
how
haphazard
tesla
s
plan
appear
ryan
popple
who
have
spent
four
year
in
the
army
and
then
gotten
an
mba
from
harvard
arrive
at
tesla
as
a
director
of
finance
meant
to
prep
the
company
to
go
public
after
examine
the
company
s
book
early
in
his
tenure
popple
ask
the
manufacturing
and
operation
head
exactly
how
he
would
get
the
car
make
he
say
well
we
will
decide
we
re
go
into
production
and
then
a
miracle
be
go
to
happen
popple
say
as
word
of
the
manufacturing
issue
reach
musk
he
become
very
concerned
about
the
way
eberhard
have
run
the
company
and
call
in
a
fixer
to
address
the
situation
one
of
tesla
s
investor
be
valor
equity
a
chicago
base
investment
firm
that
specialized
in
fine
tune
manufacturing
operation
the
company
have
be
drawn
to
tesla
s
battery
and
powertrain
technology
and
calculate
that
even
if
tesla
fail
to
sell
many
car
the
big
automaker
would
end
up
want
to
buy
its
intellectual
property
to
protect
its
investment
valor
sent
in
tim
watkins
its
manage
director
of
operation
and
he
soon
reach
some
horrific
conclusion
watkins
be
a
brit
with
degree
in
industrial
robotics
and
electrical
engineering
he
s
built
up
a
reputation
as
an
ingenious
solver
of
problem
while
do
work
in
switzerland
for
example
watkins
found
a
way
to
get
around
the
country
s
rigid
labor
law
that
limit
the
hour
employee
can
work
by
automate
a
metal
stamp
factory
so
that
it
could
run
twenty
four
hour
per
day
instead
of
sixteen
hour
like
the
factory
or
rival
watkins
be
also
know
for
keep
his
ponytail
in
place
with
a
black
scrunchie
wear
a
black
leather
jacket
and
tot
a
black
fanny
pack
everywhere
he
go
the
fanny
pack
have
his
passport
checkbook
earplug
sunscreen
food
and
an
assortment
of
other
necessity
it
s
full
of
the
everyday
thing
i
need
to
survive
say
watkins
if
i
walk
ten
foot
away
from
this
thing
i
sense
it
while
a
bit
eccentric
watkins
be
thorough
and
spent
week
talk
to
employee
and
analyze
every
part
of
tesla
s
supply
chain
to
figure
out
how
much
it
cost
to
make
the
roadster
tesla
have
do
a
decent
job
of
keep
its
employee
cost
down
it
hire
the
kid
fresh
out
of
stanford
for
rather
than
the
proven
guy
who
probably
didn
t
want
to
work
that
hard
anyway
for
but
when
it
come
to
equipment
and
material
tesla
be
a
spending
horror
show
no
one
like
use
the
company
s
software
that
tracked
the
bill
of
material
so
some
people
use
it
and
some
people
didn
t
those
that
do
use
it
often
make
huge
error
they
would
take
the
cost
of
a
part
from
the
prototype
car
and
then
estimate
how
much
of
a
discount
they
expect
when
buying
that
part
in
bulk
rather
than
actually
negotiate
to
find
a
viable
price
at
one
point
the
software
declare
that
each
roadster
should
cost
about
which
would
leave
tesla
make
about
per
vehicle
everyone
knew
the
figure
be
wrong
but
it
get
report
to
the
board
anyway
around
the
middle
of
watkins
come
to
musk
with
his
finding
musk
be
prepared
for
a
high
figure
but
felt
confident
that
the
price
of
the
car
would
come
down
significantly
over
time
as
tesla
iron
out
its
manufacturing
process
and
increase
its
sale
that
s
when
tim
told
me
it
be
really
bad
news
musk
say
it
look
like
each
roadster
could
cost
up
to
to
make
and
tesla
plan
to
sell
the
car
for
only
around
even
in
full
production
they
would
have
be
like
or
something
insane
musk
say
of
course
it
didn
t
much
matter
because
about
a
third
of
the
car
didn
t
flat
out
fuck
work
eberhard
make
attempt
to
pull
his
team
out
of
this
mess
he
d
go
to
see
a
speech
in
which
the
famous
venture
capitalist
john
doerr
who
become
a
major
investor
in
green
technology
company
declare
that
he
would
devote
his
time
and
money
to
try
to
save
the
earth
from
global
warm
because
he
owe
such
an
effort
to
his
child
eberhard
promptly
return
to
the
tesla
building
and
gin
up
a
similar
speech
in
front
of
about
a
hundred
people
eberhard
have
a
picture
of
his
young
daughter
project
onto
the
wall
of
the
main
workshop
he
ask
the
tesla
engineer
why
he
have
put
that
picture
up
one
of
them
guess
that
it
be
because
people
like
his
daughter
would
drive
the
car
to
which
eberhard
reply
no
we
be
building
this
because
by
the
time
she
be
old
enough
to
drive
she
will
know
a
car
as
something
completely
different
to
how
we
know
it
today
just
like
you
don
t
think
of
a
phone
as
a
thing
on
the
wall
with
a
cord
on
it
it
s
this
future
that
depends
on
you
eberhard
then
thanked
some
of
the
key
engineer
and
call
out
their
effort
in
public
many
of
the
engineer
have
be
pull
all
nighters
on
a
regular
basis
and
eberhard
s
show
boost
morale
we
be
all
work
ourselves
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
say
david
vespremi
a
former
tesla
spokesman
then
come
this
profound
moment
where
we
be
remind
that
building
the
car
be
not
about
get
to
an
ipo
or
sell
it
to
a
bunch
of
rich
dude
but
because
it
might
change
what
a
car
be
these
victory
though
be
not
enough
to
overcome
the
feel
share
by
many
of
the
tesla
engineer
that
eberhard
have
reach
the
end
of
his
ability
as
a
ceo
the
company
veteran
have
always
admire
eberhard
s
engineering
smart
and
continued
to
do
so
eberhard
in
fact
have
turn
tesla
into
a
cult
of
engineering
regrettably
other
part
of
the
company
have
be
neglect
and
people
doubt
eberhard
s
ability
to
take
the
company
from
the
r
d
stage
to
production
the
ridiculous
cost
of
the
car
the
transmission
the
ineffective
supplier
be
cripple
tesla
and
as
the
company
start
to
miss
its
delivery
date
many
of
the
once
fanatical
consumer
who
have
make
their
large
up
front
payment
turn
on
tesla
and
eberhard
we
saw
the
write
on
the
wall
lyon
say
everyone
knew
that
the
person
who
start
a
company
be
not
necessarily
the
right
person
to
lead
it
in
the
long
term
but
whenever
that
be
the
case
it
s
not
easy
eberhard
and
musk
have
battle
for
year
over
some
of
the
design
point
on
the
car
but
for
the
most
part
they
have
gotten
along
well
enough
neither
man
suffer
fool
and
they
certainly
share
many
of
the
same
vision
for
the
battery
technology
and
what
it
could
mean
to
the
world
what
their
relationship
could
not
survive
be
the
cost
figure
for
the
roadster
unearthed
by
watkins
it
look
to
musk
as
if
eberhard
have
grossly
mismanage
the
company
by
allow
the
part
cost
to
soar
so
high
then
as
musk
saw
it
eberhard
fail
to
disclose
the
severity
of
the
situation
to
the
board
while
on
his
way
to
give
a
talk
to
the
motor
press
guild
in
los
angeles
eberhard
receive
a
call
from
musk
and
in
a
brief
uncomfortable
chat
learn
that
he
would
be
replace
as
ceo
in
august
tesla
s
board
demote
eberhard
and
name
him
president
of
technology
which
only
exacerbate
the
company
s
issue
martin
be
so
bitter
and
disruptive
straubel
say
i
remember
him
run
around
the
office
and
sow
discontent
as
we
re
try
to
finish
the
car
and
be
run
out
of
money
and
everything
be
at
knife
s
edge
as
eberhard
saw
it
other
people
at
tesla
have
foist
a
wonky
finance
software
application
on
him
that
make
it
tricky
to
accurately
track
cost
he
contend
that
the
delay
and
cost
increase
be
partly
due
to
the
request
of
other
member
of
the
management
team
and
that
he
d
be
up
front
with
the
board
about
the
issue
beyond
that
he
thought
watkins
have
make
the
situation
out
to
be
bad
than
it
really
be
start
ups
in
silicon
valley
view
mayhem
as
standard
operating
procedure
valor
be
use
to
deal
with
old
company
eberhard
say
they
found
chaos
and
weren
t
use
to
it
this
be
the
chaos
of
a
start
up
eberhard
have
also
already
be
ask
tesla
s
board
to
replace
him
as
ceo
and
find
someone
with
more
manufacturing
experience
a
few
month
pass
and
eberhard
remain
piss
off
many
of
the
tesla
employee
felt
like
they
be
caught
in
the
middle
of
a
divorce
and
have
to
pick
their
parent
eberhard
or
musk
by
the
time
december
arrive
the
situation
be
untenable
and
eberhard
left
the
company
altogether
tesla
say
in
a
statement
that
eberhard
have
be
offer
a
position
on
its
advisory
board
although
he
deny
that
i
be
no
longer
with
tesla
motor
neither
on
its
board
of
director
nor
an
employee
of
any
sort
eberhard
say
in
a
statement
at
the
time
i
m
not
happy
with
the
way
i
be
treat
musk
sent
a
note
to
a
silicon
valley
newspaper
say
i
m
sorry
that
it
come
to
this
and
wish
it
be
not
so
it
be
not
a
question
of
personality
difference
as
the
decision
to
have
martin

say
michael
come

evaluate
the

be
a

he
didn

we

the

at

could
once

focus

rather
than
on
internal
politics
but
then
mark
s
vision
for
the

begin
to
diverge
from
musk
s
by
this
time
tesla
have
move
into
a
large
facility
at
bing
street
in
san
carlos
the
big
building
allow
tesla
to
bring
the

work
back
in

from

for
it
to
do
some
of
the

alleviate
the

issue
tesla
be
mature
as
a
car
company
although
its
wild
child
start
up
streak
remain
well
intact
while
stroll
around
the
factory
one
day
mark
saw
a
smart
car
from
daimler
on
a
lift
musk
and
straubel
have
a
small
side
project
go
on
around
the
smart
car
to
see
what
it
might
be
like
as
an
electric
vehicle
michael
didn
t
know
about
it
and
he
s
like
who
be
the
ceo
here
say
lyon
the
work
on
the
smart
car
eventually
lead
to
daimler
buying
a
percent
stake
in
tesla
mark
s
inclination
be
to
try
to
package
tesla
as
an
asset
that
could
be
sell
to
a
large
car
company
it
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
plan
while
run
flextronics
mark
have
overseen
a
vast
global
supply
chain
and
knew
the
difficulty
of
manufacturing
intimately
tesla
must
have
look
borderline
hopeless
to
him
at
this
point
the
company
could
not
make
its
one
product
well
be
poise
to
hemorrhage
money
and
have
miss
a
string
of
delivery
deadline
and
yet
its
engineer
be
still
off
do
side
experiment
make
tesla
look
as
pretty
as
possible
for
a
suitor
be
the
rational
thing
to
do
in
just
about
every
other
case
mark
would
be
thanked
for
his
decisive
plan
of
action
and
save
the
company
s
investor
from
a
big
loss
but
musk
have
little
interest
in
polish
up
tesla
s
asset
for
the
high
bidder
he
d
start
the
company
to
put
a
dent
in
the
automotive
industry
and
force
people
to
rethink
electric
car
instead
of
do
the
fashionable
silicon
valley
thing
of
pivot
toward
a
new
idea
or
plan
musk
would
dig
in
deeper
the
product
be
late
and
over
budget
and
everything
be
wrong
but
elon
didn

want
anything
to

either
sell
the

they

everyone

elon
have
a

that

not

it
he
doesn

popple
found
musk

style
aggressive
but
he
like
that
musk
would
listen
to
a
well
argue
analytical
point
and
often
change
his
mind
if
give
a
good
enough
reason
some
people
thought
elon
be

these
be
hard

us
close

i
appreciate
that
he
didn

sugarcoat

on
the

saw
a
bad

he
order
someone

though
the

no

i
be
extremely
disappointed
you
need
to
figure
out
where
your
priority

change

you
either

anything
awesome

he
can
be
incredibly
intimidate
at
time
but
doesn
t
have
a
real
sense
for
just
how
impose
he
can
be
say
one
former
tesla
executive
we
d
have
these
meeting
and
take
bet
on
who
be
go
to
get
bloody
and
bruise
if
you
told
him
that
you
make
a
particular
choice
because
it
be
the
standard
way
thing
have
always
be
do
he
d
kick
you
out
of
a
meeting
fast
he
d
say
i
never
want
to
hear
that
phrase
again
what
we
have
to
do
be
fuck
hard
and
half
assing
thing
won
t
be
tolerate
he
just
destroys
you
and
if
you
survive
he
determines
if
he
can
trust
you
he
have
to
understand
that
you
re
as
crazy
as
he
be
this
ethos
filter
through
the
entire
company
and
everyone
quickly
understood
that
musk
meant
business
straubel
while
sometimes
on
the
bad
end
of
the
critique
welcome
musk
s
hard
charge
presence
the
five
year
to
get
to
this
point
have
be
an
enjoyable
slog
for
him
straubel
have
transform
from
a
quiet
capable
engineer
who
shuffle
around
tesla
s
factory
floor
with
his
head
down
into
the
most
crucial
member
of
the
technical
team
he
knew
more
about
the
battery
and
the
electric
drivetrain
than
just
about
anyone
else
at
the
company
he
also
begin
develop
a
role
as
a
go
between
for
employee
and
musk
straubel
s
engineering
smart
and
work
ethic
have
earn

s
respect
and
straubel
found
that
he
could
deliver
difficult
message
to
musk
on
behalf
of
other
employee
as
he
would
do
for
year
to
come

also
prove
willing

check
his
ego
at

the

and
the
follow
on
sedan
to
market
to
popularize
electric
car
and
musk
look
like
the
best
person
to
make
that
happen
other
employee
have
enjoy
the
thrill
of
the
engineering
challenge
over
the
past
five
year
but
be
burnt
out
beyond
repair
wright
didn
t
believe
that
an
electric
car
for
the
mass
would
ever
take
off
he
left
and
start
his
own
company
dedicate
to
make
electric
version
of
delivery
truck
berdichevsky
have
be
a
crucial
do
anything
young
engineer
for
much
of
tesla
s
existence
now
that
the
company
employ
about
three
hundred
people
he
felt
less
effective
and
didn
t
relish
the
idea
of
suffer
for
another
five
year
to
bring
the
sedan
to
market
he
would
leave
tesla
get
a
couple
of
degree
from
stanford
and
cofound
a
start
up
look
to
make
a
revolutionary
new
battery
that
could
soon
go
into
electric
car
with
eberhard
go
tarpenning
found
tesla
less
fun
he
didn
t
see
eye
to
eye
with
drori
and
also
shy
away
from
the
idea
of
fry
his
soul
to
get
the
sedan
out
lyon
stuck
around
longer
which
be
a
minor
miracle
at
various
point
he
have
lead
the
development
of
most
of
the
core
technology
behind
the
roadster
include
the
battery
pack
the
motor
the
power
electronics
and
yes
the
transmission
this
meant
that
for
about
five
year
lyon
have
be
among
tesla
s
most
capable
employee
and
the
guy
constantly
in
the
doghouse
for
be
behind
on
something
and
thus
hold
the
rest
of
the
company
up
he
suffer
through
some
of
musk
s
more
colorful
tirade
direct
either
at
him
or
supplier
that
have
let
tesla
down
that
include
talk
of
people
s
ball
be
chopped
off
and
other
violent
or
sexual
act
lyon
also
saw
an
exhaust
stress
out
musk
spit
coffee
across
a
conference
room
table
because
it
be
cold
and
then
without
a
pause
demand
that
the
employee
work
harder
do
more
and
mess
up
less
like
so
many
people
privy
to
these
performance
lyon
come
away
with
no
illusion
about
musk
s
personality
but
with
the
utmost
respect
for
his
vision
and
drive
to
execute
work
at
tesla
back
then
be
like
be
kurtz
in
apocalypse
now
lyon
say
don
t
worry
about
the
method
or
if
they
re
unsound
just
get
the
job
do
it
come
from
elon
he
listens
asks
good
question
be
fast
on
his
foot
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
thing
tesla
could
survive
the
loss
of
some
of
these
early
hire
its
strong
brand
have
allow
the
company
to
keep
recruiting
top
talent
include
people
from
large
automotive
company
who
knew
how
to
get
over
the
last
set
of
challenge
block
the
roadster
from
reach
customer
but
tesla
s
major
issue
no
longer
revolve
around
effort
engineering
or
clever
marketing
head
into
the
company
be
run
out
of
money
the
roadster
have
cost
about
million
to
develop
way
over
the
million
originally
estimate
in
the
business
plan
under
normal
circumstance
tesla
have
probably
do
enough
to
raise
more
fund
these
however
be
not
normal
time
the
big
automaker
in
the
united
state
be
charge
toward
bankruptcy
in
the
middle
of
the
bad
financial
crisis
since
the
great
depression
in
the

of
all
this

need
to
convince
tesla

investor
to
fork
over
ten
of
million
of
additional
dollar
and
those
investor
have
to
go
to
their
constituent
to
lay
out
why
this
make
any
sense
as
musk
put
it
try
to
imagine
explain
that
you
re
invest
in
an
electric
car
company
and
everything
you
read
about
the
car
company
sound
like
it
be
shit
and
doom
and
it
s
a
recession
and
no
one
be
buying
car
all
musk
have
to
do
to
dig
tesla
out
of
this
conundrum
be
lose
his
entire
fortune
and
verge
on
a
nervous
breakdown

pain
suffer
and
survival
as
he
prepared
to
begin
film
iron
man
in
early
the
director
jon
favreau
rent
out
a
complex
in
los

that
once
belong
to

about
eighty

earlier
by

have
a
series
of
interlock

and
serve
as
a

office
for
the

it
also
supply
robert
downey
jr
who
be
to
play
iron
man
and
his
human
creator
tony
stark
with
a
splash
of
inspiration
downey
felt
nostalgic
look
at
one
of
the
large
hangar
which
have
fall
into
a
state
of
disrepair
not
too
long
ago
that
building
have
played
host
to
the
big
idea
of
a
big
man
who
shook
up
industry
and
do
thing
his
own
way
downey
heard
some
rumbling
about
a
hughes
like
figure
name
elon
musk
who
have
construct
his
own
modern
day
industrial
complex
about
ten
mile
away
instead
of
visualize
how
life
might
have
be
for
hughes
downey
could
perhaps
get
a
taste
of
the
real
thing
he
set
off
in
march
for
spacex
s
headquarters
in
el
segundo
and
wound
up
receive
a
personal
tour
from
musk
my
mind
be
not
easily
blown
but
this
place
and
this
guy
be
amaze
downey
say
to
downey
the
spacex
facility
look
like
a
giant
exotic
hardware
store
enthusiastic
employee
be
zip
about
fiddle
with
an
assortment
of
machine
young
white
collar
engineer
interact
with
blue
collar
assembly
line
worker
and
they
all
seem
to
share
a
genuine
excitement
for
what
they
be
do
it
felt
like
a
radical
start
up
company
downey
say
after
the
initial
tour
downey
come
away
pleased
that
the
set
be
hammer
out
at
the
hughes
factory
do
have
parallel
to
the
spacex
factory
thing
didn
t
feel
out
of
place
he
say
beyond
the
surroundings
downey
really
want
a
peek
inside
musk
s
psyche
the
men
walk
sat
in
musk
s
office
and
have
lunch
downey
appreciate
that
musk
be
not
a
foul
smell
fidgety
coder
whack
job
what
downey
picked
up
on
instead
be
musk
s
accessible
eccentricity
and
the
feel
that
he
be
an
unpretentious
sort
who
could
work
alongside
the
people
in
the
factory
both
musk
and
stark
be
the
type
of
men
accord
to
downey
who
have
seize
an
idea
to
live
by
and
something
to
dedicate
themselves
to
and
be
not
go
to
waste
a
moment
when
he
return
to
the
iron
man
production
office
downey
ask
that
favreau
be
sure
to
place
a
tesla
roadster
in
tony
stark
s
workshop
on
a
superficial
level
this
would
symbolize
that
stark
be
so
cool
and
connect
that
he
could
get
a
roadster
before
it
even
go
on
sale
on
a
deeper
level
the
car
be
to
be
place
as
the
near
object
to
stark
s
desk
so
that
it
form
something
of
a
bond
between
the
actor
the
character
and
musk
after
meeting
elon
and
make
him
real
to
me
i
felt
like
have
his
presence
in
the
workshop
downey
say
they
become
contemporary
elon
be
someone
tony
probably
hung
out
with
and
partied
with
or
more
likely
they
go
on
some
weird
jungle
trek
together
to
drink
concoction
with
the
shaman
after
iron
man
come
out
favreau
begin
talk
up
musk
s
role
as
the
inspiration
for
downey
s
interpretation
of
tony
stark
it
be
a
stretch
on
many
level
musk
be
not
exactly
the
type
of
guy
who
down
scotch
in
the
back
of
a
humvee
while
part
of
a
military
convoy
in
afghanistan
but
the
press
lap
up
the
comparison
and
musk
start
to
become
more
of
a
public
figure
people
who
sort
of
knew
him
as
that
paypal
guy
begin
to
think
of
him
as
the
rich
eccentric
businessman
behind
spacex
and
tesla
musk
enjoy
his
rise
profile
it
fed

tesla
basically
have
to
start
over
on
much
of
the
roadster
and
spacex
still
have
dozen
of
people
living
in
kwajalein
await
the
next
launch
of
the

both
endeavor
be
vacuum
up
musk
s
money
he
start
sell
off
prize
possession
like
the
mclaren
to
generate
extra
cash
musk
tend
to
shield
employee
from
the
gravity
of
his
fiscal
situation
by
always
encourage
them
to
do
their
best
work
at
the
same
time
he
personally
oversaw
all
significant
purchase
at
both
company
musk
also
train
employee
to
make
the
right
trade
offs
between
spending
money
and
productivity
this
struck
many
of
the
spacex
employee
as
a
novel
idea
since
they
be
use
to
traditional
aerospace
company
that
have
huge
multiyear
government
contract
and
no
day
to
day
survival
pressure
elon
would
always
be
at
work
on
sunday
and
we
have
some
chat
where
he
laid
out
his
philosophy
say
kevin
brogan
the
early
spacex
employee
he
would
say
that
everything
we
do
be
a
function
of
our
burn
rate
and
that
we
be
burning
through
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
per
day
it
be
this
very
entrepreneurial
silicon
valley
way
of
think
that
none
of
the
aerospace
engineer
in
los
angeles
be
dial
into
sometimes
he
wouldn
t
let
you
buy
a
part
for
two
thousand
dollar
because
he
expect
you
to
find
it
cheaper
or
invent
something
cheaper
other
time
he
wouldn
t
flinch
at
rent
a
plane
for
ninety
thousand
dollar
to
get
something
to
kwaj
because
it
save
an
entire
workday
so
it
be
worth
it
he
would
place
this
urgency
that
he
expect
the
revenue
in
ten
year
to
be
ten
million
dollar
a
day
and
that
every
day
we
be
slow
to
achieve
our
goal
be
a
day
of
miss
out
on
that
money
musk
have
become
all
consume
with
tesla
and
spacex
out
of
necessity
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
exacerbate
the
tension
in
his
marriage
the
musk
have
a
team
of
nanny
to
help
with
their
five
child
but
elon
could
not
spend
much
time
at
home
he
work
seven
day
a
week
and
quite
often
split
his
time
between
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
justine
need
a
change
during
moment
of
self
reflection
she
felt
sicken
perceive
herself
a
trophy
wife
justine
long
to
be
elon
s
partner
again
and
to
feel
some
of
that
spark
from
their
early
day
before
life
have
turn
so
dazzle
and
demand
it
s
not
clear
how
much
musk
let
on
to
justine
about
his
dwindle
bank
account
she
have
long
maintain
that
musk
kept
her
in
the
dark
about
the
family
s
financial
arrangement
but
some
of
musk
s
closest
friend
do
get
a
glimpse
into
the
worsen
financial
situation
in
the
first
half
of

founder
and
ceo
of
valor

met
musk
for
dinner
gracias
have
be
an
investor
in
tesla
and
have
become
one
of
musk
s
closest
friend

ally

he
could
see

agonize
over
his
future
thing
be
start
to
be
difficult
with
justine

i
remember
him

choose
the
hard
path
i
didn
t
quite
understand
at
the
time
but
i
do
now
it
s
quite
hard
quite
the
crazy
ride
riley
experienced
a
baptism
by
fire
the
whirlwind
romance
have
give
her
the
impression
that
she
be
engage
to
a
world
conquer
jet
set
billionaire
that
be
true
in
theory
but
a
murkier
proposition
in
practice
as
late
july
roll
around
musk
could
see
that
he
have
just
enough
cash
on
hand
to
scrape
through
to
the
end
of
the
year
both
spacex
and
tesla
would
need
cash
infusion
at
some
point
just
to
pay
the
employee
and
it
be
unclear
where
that
money
would
come
from
with
the
world
s
financial
market
in
disarray
and
investment
be
put
on
hold
if

have
be
go
more
smoothly
at
the
company
musk
could
have
felt
more
confident
about
raise
money
but
they
be
not
he
would
come
home
every
day
and
there
would
be
some
calamity
riley
say
he
be
under
immense
pressure
from
all
quarter
it
be
horrendous
spacex

new
project
to
develop
the

possible
replacement
to
the

spacex
have
yet
to
prove
it

falcon
soar
into
the
sky
and
flew
spectacularly
without
any
indication
of

spacex
employee
watch
a
webcast
of
the
proceeding
back
in
california
let
out
hoot
and
whistle
then
right
at
the
moment
when
the
first
stage
and
second
stage
be
to
separate
there
be
a
malfunction
an
analysis
after
the
fact
would
show
that
the
new
engine
have
deliver
an
unexpected
thrust
during
the
separation
process
that
cause
the
first
stage
to
bump
up
into
the
second
stage
damage
the
top
part
of
the
rocket
and
its
engine
the
fail
launch
left
many
spacex
employee
shatter
it
be
so
profound
see
the
energy
shift
over
the
room
in
the
course
of
thirty
second
say
dolly
singh
a
recruiter
at
spacex
it
be
like
the
bad
fuck
day
ever
you
don
t
usually
see
grown
ups
weep
but
there
they
be
we
be
tire
and
broken
emotionally
musk
address
the
worker
right
away
and
encourage
them
to
get
back
to
work
he
say
look
we
be
go
to
do
this
it
s
go
to
be
okay
don
t
freak
out
singh
recall
it
be
like
magic
everyone
chill
out
immediately
and
start
to
focus
on
figure
out
what
just
happen
and
how
to
fix
it
it
go
from
despair
to
hope
and
focus
musk
put
up
a
positive
front
to
the
public
as
well
in
a
statement
he
say
that
spacex
have
another
rocket
wait
to
attempt
a
fourth
launch
and
a
fifth
launch
plan
shortly
after
that
i
have
also
give
the
go
ahead
to
begin
fabrication
of
flight
six
he
say
falcon
development
will
also
continue
unabated
in
reality
the
third
launch
be
a
disaster
with
cascade
consequence
since
the
second
stage
of
the
rocket
do
not
fire
properly
spacex
never
get
a
chance
to
see
if
it
have
really
fix
the
fuel
slosh
issue
that
have
plague
the
second
flight
many
of
the
spacex
engineer
be
confident
that
they
have
solve
this
problem
and
be
anxious
to
get
to
the
fourth
launch
believe
that
they
have
an
easy
answer
for
the
recent
thrust
problem
for
musk
the
situation
seem
graver
i
be
super
depressed
musk
say
if
we
hadn
t
solve
the
slush
couple
problem
on
flight
two
or
there
be
just
some
random
other
thing
that
occur
say
a
mistake
in
the
launch
process
or
the
manufacturing
process
unrelated
to
anything
previous
then
game
over
spacex
simply
do
not
have
enough
money
to
try
a
fifth
flight
he
d
put
million
into
the
company
and
have
nothing
to
spare
because
of
the
issue
at
tesla
flight
four
be
it
musk
say
if
however
spacex
could
nail
the
fourth
flight
it
would
instill
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
u
s
government
and
possible
commercial
customer
pave
the
way
for
the
falcon
and
even
more
ambitious
project
lead
up
to
the
third
launch
musk
have
be
his
usual
ultra
involve
self
anyone
at
spacex
who
held
the
launch
back
go
onto
musk
s
critical
path
shit
list
musk
would
hound
the
person
responsible
about
the
delay
but
typically
he
would
also
do
everything
in
his
power
to
help
solve
problem
i
be
personally
hold
up
the
launch
once
and
have
to
give
elon
twice
daily
update
about
what
be
go
on
say
kevin
brogan
but
elon
would
say
there
be
five
hundred
people
at
this
company
what
do
you
need
one
of
the
call
must
have
take
place
while
musk
court
riley
because
brogan
remember
musk
phone
from
the
bathroom
of
a
london
club
to
find
out
how
weld
have
go
on
a
large
part
of
the
rocket
musk
field
another
call
in
the
middle
of
the
night
while
sleep
next
to
riley
and
have
to
whisper
as
he
berate
the
engineer
he
s
give
us
the
pillow
talk
voice
so
we
all
have
to
huddle
around
the
speakerphone
while
he
tell
us
you
guy
need
to
get
your
shit
together
brogan
say
with
the
fourth
launch
the
demand
and
anticipation
have
ratchet
to
the
point
that
people
start
make
silly
mistake
typically
the
body
of
the
falcon
rocket
travel
to
kwaj
via
barge
this
time
musk
and
the
engineer
be
too
excite
and
desperate
to
wait
for
the
ocean
journey
musk
rent
a
military
cargo
plane
to
fly
the
rocket
body
from
los
angeles
to
hawaii
and
then
on
to
kwaj
this
would
have
be
a
fine
idea
except
the
spacex
engineer
forgot
to
factor
in
what
the
pressurize
plane
would
do
to
the
body
of
the
rocket
which
be
less
than
an
eighth
of
an
inch
thick
as
the
plane
start
its
descent
into
hawaii
everyone
inside
of
it
could
hear
strange
noise
come
from
the
cargo
hold
i
look
back
and
could
see
the
stage
crumple
say
bulent
altan
the
former
head
of
avionics
at
spacex
i
told
the
pilot
to
go
up
and
he
do
the
rocket
have
behave
much
like
an
empty
water
bottle
will
on
a
plane
with
the
air
pressure
push
against
the
side
of
the
bottle
and
make
it
buckle
altan
calculate
that
the
spacex
team
on
the
plane
have
about
thirty
minute
to
do
something
about
the
problem
before
they
would
need
to
land
they
pull
out
their
pocketknife
and
cut
away
the
shrink
wrap
that
held
the
rocket
s
body
tight
then
they
found
a
maintenance
kit
on
the
plane
and
use
wrench
to
open
up
some
nut
on
the
rocket
that
would
allow
its
internal
pressure
to
match
that
of
the
plane
s
when
the
plane
land
the
engineer
divvied
up
the
duty
of
call
spacex
s
top
executive
to
tell
them
about
the
catastrophe
it
be
a
m
los
angeles
time
and
one
of
the
executive
volunteer
to
deliver
the
horrific
news
to
musk
the
think
at
the
time
be
that
it
would
take
three
month
to
repair
the
damage
the
body
of
the
rocket
have
cave
in
in
several
place
baffle
place
inside
the
fuel
tank
to
stop
the
slosh
problem
have
broken
and
an
assortment
of
other
issue
have
appear
musk
order
the
team
to
continue
on
to
kwaj
and
sent
in
a
reinforcement
team
with
repair
part
two
week
later
the
rocket
have
be
fix
inside
of
the
makeshift
hangar
it
be
like
be
stuck
in
a
foxhole
together
altan
say
you
weren
t
go
to
quit
and
leave
the
person
next
to
you
behind
when
it
be
all
do
everyone
felt
amaze
the
fourth
and
possibly
final
launch
for
spacex
take
place
on
september
the
spacex
employee
have
work
nonstop
shift
under
agonize
pressure
for
six
week
to
reach
this
day
their
pride
as
engineer
and
their
hope
and
dream
be
on
the
line
the
people
watch
back
at
the
factory
be
try
their
best
not
to
throw
up
say
james
mclaury
a
machinist
at
spacex
despite
their
past
flub
the
engineer
on
kwaj
be
confident
that
this
launch
would
work
some
of
these
people
have
spent
year
on
the
island
go
through
one
of
the
more
surreal
engineering
exercise
in
human
history
they
have
be
separate
from
their
family
assault
by
the
heat
and
exile
on
their
tiny
launchpad
outpost
sometimes
without
much
food
for
day
on
end
as
they
wait
for
the
launch
window
to
open
and
dealt
with
the
abort
that
follow
so
much
of
that
pain
and
suffer
and
fear
would
be
forgotten
if
this
launch
go
successfully
in
the
late
afternoon
on
the
twenty
eighth
the
spacex
team
raise
the
falcon
into
its
launch
position
once
again
it
stood
tall
look
like
a
bizarre
artifact
of
an
island
tribe
as
palm
tree
swayed
beside
it
and
a
smatter
of
cloud
cross
through
the
spectacular
blue
sky
by
this
time
spacex
have
upped
its
webcast
game
turn
each
launch
into
a
major
production
both
for
its
employee
and
the
public
two
spacex
marketing
executive
spent
twenty
minute
before
the
launch
go
through
all
the
technical
in
and
out
of
the
launch
the
falcon
be
not
carry
real
cargo
this
time
neither
the
company
nor
the
military
want
to
see
something
else
blow
up
or
get
lose
at
sea
so
the
rocket
held
a
pound
dummy
payload
the
fact
that
spacex
have
be
reduce
to
launch
theater
do
not
faze
the
employee
or
dampen
their
enthusiasm
as
the
rocket
rumble
and
then
climbed
high
the
employee
back
at
spacex
headquarters
let
out
raucous
cheer
each
milestone
that
follow
clearing
the
island
engine
check
come
back
good
be
again
met
with
whistle
and
shout
as
the
first
stage
fell
away
the
second
stage
fire
up
about
ninety
second
into
the
flight
and
the
employee
turn
downright
rapturous
fill
the
webcast
with
their
ecstatic
holler
perfect
say
one
of
the
talk
head
the
kestrel
engine
glowed
red
and
start
its
six
minute
burn
when
the
second
stage
clear
i
could
finally
start
breathing
again
and
my
knee
stop
buckling
say
mclaury
the
fair
open
up
around
the
three
minute
mark
and
fell
back
toward
earth
and
finally
around
nine
minute
into
its
journey
the
falcon
shut
down
just
as
plan
and
reach
orbit
make
it
the
first
privately
built
machine
to
accomplish
such
a
feat
it
take
six
year
about
four
and
half
more
than
musk
have
once
plan
and
five
hundred
people
to
make
this
miracle
of
modern
science
and
business
happen
earlier
in
the
day
musk
have
try
to
distract
himself
from
the
mount
pressure
by
go
to
disneyland
with
his
brother
kimbal
and
their
child
musk
then
have
to
race
back
to
make
the
p
m
launch
and
walk
into
spacex
s
trailer
control
room
about
two
minute
before
blastoff
when
the
launch
be
successful
everyone
burst
into
tear
kimbal
say
it
be
one
of
the
most
emotional
experience
i
ve
have
musk
left
the
control
room
and
walk
out
to
the
factory
floor
where
he
receive
a
rock
star
s
welcome
well
that
be
freak
awesome
he
say
there
be
a
lot
of
people
who
thought
we
couldn
t
do
it
a
lot
actually
but
as
the
say
go
the
fourth
time
be
the
charm
right
there
be
only
a
handful
of
country
on
earth
that
have
do
this
it
s
normally
a
country
thing
not
a
company
thing
my
mind
be
kind
of
frazzle
so
it
s
hard
for
me
to
say
anything
but
man
this
be
definitely
one
of
the
great
day
in
my
life
and
i
think
probably
for
most
people
here
we
show
people
we
can
do
it
this
be
just
the
first
step
of
many
i
be
go
to
have
a
really
great
party
tonight
i
don
t
know
about
you
guy
mary
beth
brown
then
tapped
musk
on
the
shoulder
and
pull
him
away
to
a
meeting
the
afterglow
of
this
mammoth
victory
fade
soon
after
the
party
end
and
the
severity
of
spacex
s
financial
hell
become
top
of
mind
again
for
musk
spacex
have
the
falcon
effort
to
support
and
have
also
immediately
green
light
the
construction
of
another
machine
the
dragon
capsule
that
would
be
use
to
take
supply
and
one
day
human
to
the
international
space
station
historically
either
project
would
cost
more
than
billion
to
complete
but
spacex
would
have
to
find
a
way
to
build
both
machine
simultaneously
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost
the
company
have
dramatically
increase
the
rate
at
which
it
hire
employee
and
move
into
a
much
large
headquarters
in
hawthorne
california
spacex
have
a
commercial
flight
book
to
carry
a
satellite
into
orbit
for
the
malaysian
government
but
that
launch
and
the
payment
for
it
would
not
arrive
until
the
middle
of
in
the
meantime
spacex
simply
struggle
to
make
its
payroll
the
press
do
not
know
the
extent
of
musk
s
financial
woe
but
they
knew
enough
to
turn
detail
tesla
s
precarious
financial
situation
into
a
favor
pastime
a
website
call
the
truth
about
car
begin
a
tesla
death
watch
in
may
and
follow
up
with
dozen
of
entry
throughout
the
year
the
blog
take
special
pleasure
in
reject
the
idea
that
musk
be
a
true
founder
of
the
company
present
him
as
the
moneyman
and
chairman

replace
drori
on
the
ground
that
musk
have
just
lucked
into
his
past
success
it
follow
that
by
printing
a
tell
all
e
mail
from
a
tesla
employee
the
report
say
that
tesla
have
just
go
through
a
round
of
layoff
shut
down
its
detroit
office
and
have
only
million
left
in
the
bank
we
have
over
reservation
which
mane
sic
we
ve
take
multiple
of
ten
of
million
of

from
our
customer
and
have
spent
them
all
the
tesla

write
meanwhile
we
only
deliver
less

i
actually
talk
a
close
friend
of
mine
into
put
down
for
a
tesla
roadster
i
cannot
conscientiously
be
a
bystander
anymore
and
allow
my
company
to
deceive
the
public
and
defraud
our
dear
customer
our
customer
and
the
general
public
be
the
reason
tesla
be
so
love
the
fact
that
they
be
be
lie
to
be
just
wrong
yes
tesla
deserve
much
of
the
negative
attention
musk
though
felt
like
the
climate
with
the
hatred
of
banker
and
the
rich
have
turn
him
into
a
particularly
juicy
target
i
be
just
get
pistol
whip
musk
say
there
be
a
lot
of
schadenfreude
at
the
time
and
it
be
bad
on
so
many
level
justine
be
torture
me
in
the
press
there
be
always
all
these
negative
article
about
tesla
and
the
story
about
spacex
s
third
failure
it
hurt
really
bad
you
have
these
huge
doubt
that
your
life
be
not
work
your
car
be
not
work
you
re
go
through
a
divorce
and
all
of
those
thing
i
felt
like
a
pile
of
shit
i
didn
t
think
we
would
overcome
it
i
thought
thing
be
probably
fuck
doom
when
musk
ran
through
the
calculation
concern
spacex
and
tesla
it
occur
to
him
that
only
one
company
would
likely
even
have
a
chance
at
survival
i
could
either
pick
spacex
or
tesla
or
split
the
money
i
have
left
between
them
musk
say
that
be
a
tough
decision
if
i
split
the
money
maybe
both
of
them
would
die
if
i
give
the
money
to
just
one
company
the
probability
of
it
survive
be
great
but
then
it
would
mean
certain
death
for
the
other
company
i
debate
that
over
and
over
while
musk
meditate
on
this
the
economy
worsen
quickly

so
too

these
conversation
in

she

it
s
really
hard
to
watch
someone
you

like
that
because
of
the
long
hour
that
he

under
his

and
die
he
seem
like
a
man
on
the
brink
in
the
middle
of
the
night
musk
would
have
nightmare
and
yell
out
he
be
in
physical
pain
riley
say
he
would
climb
on

a
way

he
definitely
take

of
billion
musk
reach
out
through
some
back
channel

out
that

even
be
a
front
runner
for
the
deal
musk
begin
do
everything
in
his
power

musk
make
a
last
ditch
effort
to
raise
all
the
personal
fund
he
could
and
put
them
into
the
company
he
take
out
a

which
nasa

be
like
the
fuck
matrix
musk
say
describe
his
financial
maneuver
the
everdream
deal
really
save
my
butt
musk
have
cobble
together
million
and
ask
tesla
s
exist
investor
since
no
new
investor
materialize
to
match
that
figure
the
investor
agree
and
on
december
they
be
in
the
process
of
finalize
the
paperwork
for
the
funding
round
when
musk
notice
a
problem
vantagepoint
capital
partner
have
sign
all
of
the
paperwork
except
for
one
crucial
page
musk
phone
up
alan
salzman
vantagepoint
s
cofounder
and
manage
partner
to
ask
about
the
situation
salzman
inform
musk
that
the
firm
have
a
problem
with
the
investment
round
because
it
undervalue
tesla
i
say
i
ve
get
an
excellent
solution
then
take
my
entire
portion
of
the
deal
i
have
a
real
hard
time
come
up
with
the
money
base
on
the
cash
we
have
in
the
bank
right
now
we
will
bounce
payroll
next
week
so
unless
you
ve
get
another
idea
can
you
either
just
participate
as
much
as
you
d
like
or
allow
the
round
to
go
through
because
otherwise
we
will
be
bankrupt
salzman
balk
and
told
musk
to
come
in
the
follow
week
at
a
m
to
present
to
vantagepoint
s
top
brass
not
have
a
week
of
time
to
work
with
musk
ask
to
come
in
the
next
day
and
salzman
refuse
that
offer
force
musk
to
continue
take
on
loan
the
only
reason
he
want
the
meeting
at
his
office
be
for
me
to
come
on
bend
knee
beg
for
money
so
he
could
say
no
musk
theorize
what
a
fuckhead
vantagepoint
decline
to
speak
about
this
period
but
musk
believe
that
salzman
s
tactic
be
part
of
a
mission
to
bankrupt
tesla
musk
fear
that
vantagepoint
would
oust
him
as
ceo
recapitalize
tesla
and
emerge
as
the
major
owner
of
the
carmaker
it
could
then
sell
tesla
to
a
detroit
automaker
or
focus
on
sell
electric
drivetrains
and
battery
pack
instead
of
make
car
such
reason
would
have
be
quite
practical
from
a
business
standpoint
but
do
not
match
up
with
musk
s
goal
for
tesla
vantagepoint
be
force
that
wisdom
down
the
throat
of
an
entrepreneur
who
want
to
do
something
big
and
bolder
say
steve
jurvetson
a
partner
at
draper
fisher
jurvetson
and
tesla
investor
maybe
they
re
use
to
a
ceo
buckling
but
elon
doesn
t
do
that
instead
musk
take
another
huge
risk
tesla
recharacterized
the
funding
as
a
debt
round
rather
than
an
equity
round
know
that
vantagepoint
could
not
interfere
with
a
debt
deal
the
tricky
part
of
this
strategy
be
that
investor
like
jurvetson
who
want
to
help
tesla
be
put
in
a
bind
because
venture
capital
firm
be
not
structure
to
do
debt
deal
and
convincing
their
backer
to
alter
their
normal
rule
of
engagement
for
a
company
that
could
very
well
go
bankrupt
in
a
matter
of
day
would
be
a
very
tough
ask
know
this
musk
bluffed
he
told
the
investor
that
he
would
take
another
loan
from
spacex
and
fund
the
entire
round
all
million
himself
the
tactic
work
when
you
have
scarcity
it
naturally
reinforces
greed
and
lead
to
more
interest
jurvetson
say
it
be
also
easy
for
us
to
go
back
to
our
firm
and
say
here
be
the
deal
go
or
no
go
the
deal
end
up
closing
on
christmas
eve
hour
before
tesla
would
have
go
bankrupt
musk
have
just
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollar
left
and
could
not
have
make
payroll
the
next
day
musk
ultimately
put
in
million
and
the
investment
firm
put
up
the
rest
as
for
salzman
musk
say
he
should
be
ashamed
of
himself
at
spacex
musk
and
the
company
s
top
executive
have
spent
most
of
december
in
a
state
of
fear
accord
to
report
in
the
press
spacex
the
onetime
front
runner
for
the
large
nasa
contract
have
suddenly
lose
favor
with
the
space
agency
michael
griffin
who
have
once
almost
be
a
cofounder
of
spacex
be
the
head
of
nasa
and
have
turn
on
musk
griffin
do
not
care
for
musk
s
aggressive
business
tactic
see
him
as
borderline
unethical
others
have
suggest
that
griffin
end
up
be
jealous
of
musk
and
spacex
on
december
however
spacex
receive
a
shock
people
inside
nasa
have
back
spacex
to
become
a
supplier
for
the
i
the
company
receive
billion
as
payment
for
twelve
flight
to
the
space
station
stay
with
kimbal
in
boulder
colorado
for
the
holiday
musk
broke
down
in
tear
as
the
spacex
and
tesla
transaction
process
i
hadn
t
have
an
opportunity
to
buy
a
christmas
present
for
talulah
or
anything
he
say
i

down
the
fuck
street
in
boulder
and
the
only
place
that

open

these
shitty
trinket
and
they
be
about
to
close
the
best
thing

people
who

coder
who

rude
awakening
company
will
typically
challenge
software

on
the
spot
by
ask
them
to

problem
that
require
a

handle

they

an

for

about
why
they

the

up

almost
every

one
thousand

technician
and
have
continued
to

the

as
the

each
employee
receives
a
warn
before
go
to
meet
with

the
interview
he
or
she
be
told
could
last
anywhere
from
thirty
second
to
fifteen
minute
elon
will
likely
keep
on
write
e
mail
and
work
during
the
initial
part
of
the
interview
and
not
speak
much
don
t
panic
that
s
normal
eventually
he
will
turn
around
in
his
chair
to
face
you
even
then
though
he
might
not
make
actual
eye
contact
with
you
or
fully
acknowledge
your
presence
don
t
panic
that
s
normal
in
due
course
he
will
speak
to
you
from
that
point
the
tale
of
engineer
who
have
interviewed
with
musk
run
the
gamut
from
torturous
experience
to
the
sublime
he
might
ask
one
question
or
he
might
ask
several
you
can
be
sure
though
that
he
will
roll
out
the
riddle
you
re
stand
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
you
walk
one
mile
south
one
mile
west
and
one
mile
north
you
end
up
exactly
where
you
start
where
be
you
one
answer
to
that
be
the
north
pole
and
most
of
the
engineer
get
it
right
away
that
s
when
musk
will
follow
with
where
else
could
you
be
the
other
answer
be
somewhere
close
to
the
south
pole
where
if
you
walk
one
mile
south
the
circumference
of
the
earth
becomes
one
mile
few
engineer
get
this
answer
and
musk
will
happily
walk
them
through
that
riddle
and
others
and
cite
any
relevant
equation
during
his
explanation
he
tends
to
care
less
about
whether
or
not
the
person
get
the
answer
than
about
how
they
describe
the
problem
and
their
approach
to
solve
it
when
speak
to
potential
recruit
singh
try
to
energize
them
and
be
up
front
about
the
demand
of
spacex
and
of
musk
at
the
same
time
the
recruiting
pitch
be
spacex
be
special
force
she
say
if
you
want
as
hard
as
it
get
then
great
if
not
then
you
shouldn
t
come
here
once
at
spacex
the
new
employee
found
out
very
quickly
if
they
be
indeed
up
for
the
challenge
many
of
them
would
quit
within
the
first
few
month
because
of
the
ninety
plus
hour
workweek
others
quit
because
they
could
not
handle
just
how
direct
musk
and
the
other
executive
be
during
meeting
elon
doesn
t
know
about
you
and
he
hasn
t
thought
through
whether
or
not
something
be
go
to
hurt
your
feeling
singh
say
he
just
know
what
the
fuck
he
want
do
people
who
do
not
normalize
to
his
communication
style
do
not
do
well
there
s
an
impression
that
spacex
suffers
from
incredibly
high
turnover
and
the
company
have
without
question
churn
through
a
fair
number
of

of
the
key

hung

most

stay
on

at

five
year
to
have
their
stock
option

and
to
see
their

through
this
be
typical
behavior
for
any
technology
company
spacex
and
musk
also
seem
to
inspire
an
unusual
level

to
conjure
up
that
steve

zeal
among
his

be
so
clear
singh
say
he
almost
hypnotizes
you
he
give
you
the
crazy
eye
and
it
s
like

ludicrous

spacex
will
sometimes
load

once
a

equal

outperforms
the
commercial

it
becomes
the
de

hardware
there
have
also
be
numerous
time
when
spacex
have
do
pioneer
work
on

very
complex

a
two
story
machine
design
to
perform
what
s
know
as
friction
stir
weld
the
machine
allows
spacex
to
automate
the
weld
process
for
massive
sheet
of
metal
like
the
one
that
make
up

it
up

and
then
join
them
together
with
a
weld
that
could
run
twenty
foot
or
more
aerospace
company
typically
try
to
avoid
weld
whenever
possible
because
they
create
weakness
in
the
metal
and
that
s
limited
the
size
of
metal

they
can
use

then

put
your
thumb
down
on
the
seam
and
twist
the
metal
together
this
type
of
weld
tends
to
result
in
much
strong
bond
than
traditional
weld
company
have
perform
friction

before

not
on

to
the
degree
to
which
spacex
have
use
the
technique
as
a
result
of
its
trial

error
spacex
can
now
join

shave
hundred

pound
off
the
weight
of

able
to

musk
s
competitor
in
the
auto

might
soon
need
to
do
the

spacex
have
transfer

as

hire
one
brilliant

musk
realize
he
could
tap
into
their

he
would

learn
ninety

you

no

this

simply
cannot

himself
he
s
an

by
nature

it
can

make
calculation

it

base
on
the

that

will
progress

that
all
the
member
of
his
team
have
muskian
ability
and
work
ethic
as
brogan
joked
musk
might
forecast
how
long
a
software
project
will
take
by
timing
the
amount
of
second
need
physically
to
write
a
line
of
code
and
then
extrapolate
that
out
to
match
however
many
line
of
code
he
expect
the
final
piece
of
software
to
be
it
s
an
imperfect
analogy
but
one
that
do
not
seem
that
far
off
from
musk
s
worldview
everything
he
do
be
fast
brogan
say
he
pee
fast
it
s
like
a
fire
hose
three
second
and
out
he
s
authentically
in
a
hurry
ask
about
his
approach
musk
say
i
certainly
don
t
try
to
set
impossible
goal
i
think
impossible
goal
be
demotivating
you
don
t
want
to
tell
people
to
go
through
a
wall
by
banging
their
head
against
it
i
don
t
ever
set
intentionally
impossible
goal
but
i
ve
certainly
always
be
optimistic
on
time
frame
i
m
try
to
recalibrate
to
be
a
little
more
realistic
i
don
t
assume
that
it
s
just
like
of
me
or
something
like
that
i
mean
in
the
case
of
the
early
spacex
day
it
would
have
be
just
the
lack
of
understand
of
what
it
take
to
develop
a
rocket
in
that
case
i
be
off
by
say
percent
i
think
future
program
might
be
off
by
anywhere
from
like
percent
to
percent
as
oppose
to
percent
so
i
think
generally
you
do
want
to
have
a
timeline
where
base
on
everything
you
know
about
the
schedule
should
be
x
and
you
execute
towards
that
but
with
the
understand
that
there
will
be
all
sort
of
thing
that
you
don
t
know
about
that
you
will
encounter
that
will
push
the
date
beyond
that
it
doesn
t
mean
that
you
shouldn
t
have
try
to
aim
for
that
date
from
the
begin
because
aim
for
something
else
would
have
be
an
arbitrary
time
increase
it
s
different
to
say
well
what
do
you
promise
people
because
you
want
to
try
to
promise
people
something
that
include
schedule
margin
but
in
order
to
achieve
the
external
promise
schedule
you
ve
get
to
have
an
internal
schedule
that
s
more
aggressive
than
that
sometimes
you
still
miss
the
external
schedule
spacex
by
the
way
be
not
alone
here
be
late
be
par
for
the
course
in
the
aerospace
industry
it
s
not
a
question
of
if
it
s
late
it
s
how
late
will
the
program
be
i
don
t
think
an
aerospace
program
have
be
complete
on
time
since
bloody
world
war
ii
deal
with
the
epically
aggressive
schedule
and
musk
s
expectation
have
require
spacex
s
engineer
to
develop
a
variety
of
survival
technique
musk
often
asks
for
highly
detailed
proposal
for
how
project
will
be
accomplish
the
employee
have
learn
never
to
break
the
time
need
to
accomplish
something
down
into
month
or
week
musk
want
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
forecast
and
sometimes
even
minute
by
minute
countdown
and
the
fallout
from
miss
schedule
be
severe
you
have
to
put
in
when
you
would
go
to
the
bathroom
brogan
say
i
m
like
elon
sometimes
people
need
to
take
a
long
dump
spacex
s
top
manager
work
together
to
in
essence
create
fake
schedule
that
they
know
will
please
musk
but
that
be
basically
impossible
to
achieve
this
would
not
be
such
a
horrible
situation
if
the
target
be
kept
internal
musk
however
tends
to
quote
these
fake
schedule
to
customer
unintentionally
give
them
false
hope
typically
it
fall
to
gwynne
shotwell
spacex
s
president
to
clean
up
the
result
mess
she
will
either
need
to
ring
up
a
customer
to
give
them
a
more
realistic
timeline
or
concoct
a
litany
of
excuse
to
explain
away
the
inevitable
delay
poor
gwynne
brogan
say
just
to
hear
her
on
the
phone
with
the
customer
be
agonize
there
can
be
no
question
that
musk
have
master
the
art
of
get
the
most
out
of
his
employee
interview
three
dozen
spacex
engineer
and
each
one
of
them
will
have
picked
up
on
a
managerial
nuance
that
musk
have
use
to
get
people
to
meet
his
deadline
one
example
from
brogan
where
a
typical
manager
may
set
the
deadline
for
the
employee
musk
guide
his
engineer
into
take
ownership
of
their
own
delivery
date
he
doesn
t
say
you
have
to
do
this
by
friday
at
two
p
m
brogan
say
he
say
i
need
the
impossible
do
by
friday
at
two
p
m
can
you
do
it
then
when
you
say
yes
you
be
not
work
hard
because
he
told
you
to
you
re
work
hard
for
yourself
it
s
a
distinction
you
can
feel
you
have
sign
up
to
do
your
own
work
and
by
recruiting
hundred
of
bright
self
motivate
people
spacex
have
maximize
the
power
of
the
individual
one
person
put
in
a
sixteen
hour
day
end
up
be
much
more
effective
than
two
people
work
eight
hour
day
together
the
individual
doesn
t
have
to
hold
meeting
reach
a
consensus
or
bring
other
people
up
to
speed
on
a
project
he
just
keep
work
and
work
and
work
the
ideal
spacex
employee
be
someone
like
steve
davis
the
director
of
advanced
project
at
spacex
he
s
be
work
sixteen
hour
a
day
every
day
for
year
brogan
say
he
get
more
do
than
eleven
people
work
together
to
find
davis
musk
call
a
teach
assistant
in
stanford
s
aeronautics
department
and
ask
him
if
there
be
any
hardworking
bright
master
s
and
doctoral
candidate
who
didn
t
have
family
the
ta
point
musk
to
davis
who
be
pursue
a
master
s
degree
in
aerospace
engineering
to
add
to
degree
in
finance
mechanical
engineering
and
particle
physic
musk
call
davis
on
a
wednesday
and
offer
him
a
job
the
follow
friday
davis
be
the
twenty
second
spacex
hire
and
have
end
up
the
twelfth
most
senior
person
still
at
the
company
he
turn
thirty
five
in
davis
do
his
tour
of
duty
on
kwaj
and
consider
it
the
great
time
of
his
life
every
night
you
could
either
sleep
by
the
rocket
in
this
tent
shelter
where
the
gecko
crawl
all
over
you
or
take
this
one
hour
boat
ride
that
make
you
seasick
back
to
the
main
island
he
say
every
night
you
have
to
pick
the
pain
that
you
remember
least
you
get
so
hot
and
exhaust
it
be
just
amaze
after
work
on
the
falcon
davis
move
to
the
falcon
and
then
dragon
the
dragon
capsule
take
spacex
four
year
to
design
it
s
likely
the
fast
project
of
its
ilk
do
in
the
history
of
the
aerospace
industry
the
project
start
with
musk
and
a
handful
of
engineer
most
of
them
under
thirty
year
old
and
peaked
at
one
hundred
people
they
cribbed
from
past
capsule
work
and
read
over
every
paper
publish
by
nasa
and
other
aeronautics
body
around
project
like
gemini
and
apollo
if
you
go
search
for
something
like
apollo
s
reentry
guidance
algorithm
there
be
these
great
database
that
will
just
spit
out
the
answer
davis
say
the
engineer
at
spacex
then
have
to
figure
out
how
to
advance
these
past
effort
and
bring
the
capsule
into
the
modern
age
some
of
the
area
of
improvement
be
obvious
and
easily
accomplish
while
others
require
more
ingenuity
saturn
and
apollo
have
colossal
compute
bay
that
produce
only
a
fraction
of
the
computer
horsepower
that
can
be
achieve
today
on
say
an
ipad
the
spacex
engineer
knew
they
could
save
a
lot
of
room
by
cut
out
some
of
the
computer
while
also
add
capability
with
their
more
powerful
equipment
the
engineer
decide
that
while
dragon
would
look
a
lot
like
apollo
it
would
have
steeper
wall
angle
to
clear
space
for
gear
and
for
the
astronaut
that
the
company
hop
to
fly
spacex
also
get
the
recipe
for
its
heat
shield
material
call
pica
through
a
deal
with
nasa
the
spacex
engineer
found
out
how
to
make
the
pica
material
less
expensively
and
improve
the
underlie
recipe
so
that
dragon
from
day
one
could
withstand
the
heat
of
a
reentry
come
back
from
mar
the
total
cost
for
dragon
come
in
at
million
which
would
be
on
the
order
of
to
time
less
than
capsule
project
built
by
other
company
the
metal
come
in
we
roll
it
out
weld
it
and
make
thing
davis
say
we
build
almost
everything
in
house
that
be
why
the
cost
have
come
down
davis
like
brogan
and
plenty
of
other
spacex
engineer
have
have
musk
ask
for
the
seemingly
impossible
his
favorite
request
date
back
to
spacex
need
an
actuator
that
would
trigger
the
gimbal
action
use
to
steer
the
upper
stage
of
falcon
davis
have
never
built
a
piece
of
hardware
before
in
his
life
and
naturally
go
out
to
find
some
supplier
who
could
make
an
electromechanical
actuator
for
him
he
get
a
quote
back
for
elon
laugh
davis
say
he
say
that
part
be
no
more
complicate
than
a
garage
door
opener
your
budget
be
five
thousand
dollar
go
make
it
work
davis
spent
nine
month
building
the
actuator
at
the
end
of
the
process
he
toil
for
three
hour
write
an
e
mail
to
musk
cover
the
pro
and
con
of
the
device
the
e
mail
go
into
gory
detail
about
how
davis
have
design
the
part
why
he
have
make
various
choice
and
what
its
cost
would
be
as
he
press
send
davis
felt
anxiety
surge
through
his
body
know
that
he
d
give
his
all
for
almost
a
year
to
do
something
an
engineer
at
another
aerospace
company
would
not
even
attempt
musk
reward
all
of
this
toil
and
angst
with
one
of
his
standard
response
he
write
back
ok
the
actuator
davis
design
end
up
cost
and
flew
with
falcon
into
space
i
put
every
ounce
of
intellectual
capital
i
have
into
that
e
mail
and
one
minute
later
get
that
simple
response
davis
say
everyone
in
the
company
be
have
that
same
experience
one
of
my
favorite
thing
about
elon
be
his
ability
to
make
enormous
decision
very
quickly
that
be
still
how
it
work
today
kevin
watson
can
attest
to
that
he
arrive
at
spacex
in
after
spending
twenty
four
year
at
nasa
s
jet
propulsion
laboratory
watson
work
on
a
wide
variety
of
project
at
jpl
include
building
and
test
compute
system
that
could
withstand
the
harsh
condition
of
space
jpl
would
typically
buy
expensive
specially
toughen
computer
and
this
frustrate
watson
he
daydream
about
way
to
handcraft
much
cheaper
equally
effective
computer
while
have
his
job
interview
with
musk
watson
learn
that
spacex
need
just
this
type
of
think
musk
want
the
bulk
of
a
rocket
s
compute
system
to
cost
no
more
than
it
be
an
insane
figure
by
aerospace
industry
standard
where
the
avionics
system
for
a
rocket
typically
cost
well
over
million
in
traditional
aerospace
it
would
cost
you
more
than
ten
thousand
dollar
just
for
the
food
at
a
meeting
to
discus
the
cost
of
the
avionics
watson
say
during
the
job
interview
watson
promise
musk
that
he
could
do
the
improbable
and
deliver
the
avionics
system
he
begin
work
on
make
the
computer
for
dragon
right
after
be
hire
the
first
system
be
call
cucu
pronounce
cuckoo
this
communication
box
would
go
inside
the
international
space
station
and
communicate
back
with
dragon
a
number
of
people
at
nasa
refer
to
the
spacex
engineer
as
the
guy
in
the
garage
and
be
cynical
about
the
start
up
s
ability
to
do
much
of
anything
include
building
this
type
of
machine
but
spacex
produce
the
communication
computer
in
record
time
and
it
end
up
as
the
first
system
of
its
kind
to
pas
nasa
s
protocol
test
on
the
first
try
nasa
official
be
force
to
say
cuckoo
over
and
over
again
during
meeting
a
small
act
of
defiance
spacex
have
plan
all
along
to
torture
nasa
as
the
month
go
on
watson
and
other
engineer
built
out
the
complete
compute
system
for
dragon
and
then
adapt
the
technology
for
falcon
the
result
be
a
fully
redundant
avionics
platform
that
use
a
mix
of
off
the
shelf
compute
gear
and
product
built
in
house
by
spacex
it
cost
a
bit
more
than
but
come
close
to
meeting
musk
s
goal
spacex
reinvigorate
watson
who
have
become
disenchant
with
jpl
s
acceptance
of
wasteful
spending
and
bureaucracy
musk
have
to
sign
off
on
every
expenditure
over
it
be
his
money
that
we
be
spending
and
he
be
keep
an
eye
on
it
as
he
damn
well
should
watson
say
he
make
sure
nothing
stupid
be
happen
decision
be
make
quickly
during
weekly
meeting
and
the
entire
company
bought
into
them
it
be
amaze
how
fast
people
would
adapt
to
what
come
out
of
those
meeting
watson
say
the
entire
ship
could
turn
ninety
degree
instantly
lockheed
martin
could
never
do
anything
like
that
watson
continued
elon
be
brilliant
he
s
involve
in
just
about
everything
he
understands
everything
if
he
asks
you
a
question
you
learn
very
quickly
not
to
go
give
him
a
gut
reaction
he
want
answer
that
get
down
to
the
fundamental
law
of
physic
one
thing
he
understands
really
well
be
the
physic
of
the
rocket
he
understands
that
like
nobody
else
the
stuff
i
have
see
him
do
in
his
head
be
crazy
he
can
get
in
discussion
about
fly
a
satellite
and
whether
we
can
make
the
right
orbit
and
deliver
dragon
at
the
same
time
and
solve
all
these
equation
in
real
time
it
s
amaze
to
watch
the
amount
of
knowledge
he
have
accumulate
over
the
year
i
don
t
want
to
be
the
person
who
ever
have
to
compete
with
elon
you
might
as
well
leave
the
business
and
find
something
else
fun
to
do
he
will
outmaneuver
you
outthink
you
and
out
execute
you
one
of
watson
s
top
discovery
at
spacex
be
the
test
bed
on
the
third
floor
of
the
hawthorne
factory
spacex
have
test
version
of
all
the
hardware
and
electronics
that
go
into
a
rocket
laid
out
on
metal
table
it
have
in
effect
replicate
the
innards
of
a
rocket
end
to
end
in
order
to
run
thousand
of
flight
simulation
someone
launch
the
rocket
from
a
computer
and
then
every
piece
of
mechanical
and
compute
hardware
be
monitor
with
sensor
an
engineer
can
tell
a
valve
to
open
then
check
to
see
if
it
open
how
quickly
it
open
and
the
level
of
current
run
to
it
this
test
apparatus
let
spacex
engineer
practice
ahead
of
launch
and
figure
out
how
they
would
deal
with
all
manner
of
anomaly
during
the
actual
flight
spacex
have
people
in
the
test
facility
who
can
replicate
error
see
on
falcon
or
dragon
and
make
adjustment
accordingly
spacex
have
make
numerous
change
on
the
fly
with
this
system
in
one
case
someone
spot
an
error
in
a
software
file
in
the
hour
right
before
a
launch
spacex
s
engineer
change
the
file
checked
how
it
affected
the
test
hardware
and
when
no
problem
be
detect
sent
the
file
to
the
falcon
wait
on
the
launchpad
all
in
less
than
thirty
minute
nasa
wasn
t
use
to
this
watson
say
if
something
go
wrong
with
the
shuttle
everyone
be
just
resign
to
wait
three
week
before
they
could
try
and
launch
again
from
time
to
time
musk
will
send
out
an
e
mail
to
the
entire
company
to
enforce
a
new
policy
or
let
them
know
about
something
that
s
bother
him
one
of
the
more
famous
e
mail
arrive
in
may
with
the
subject
line
acronym
seriously
suck
there
be
a
creep
tendency
to
use
make
up
acronym
at
spacex
excessive
use
of
make
up
acronym
be
a
significant
impediment
to
communication
and
keep
communication
good
as
we
grow
be
incredibly
important
individually
a
few
acronym
here
and
there
may
not
seem
so
bad
but
if
a
thousand
people
be
make
these
up
over
time
the
result
will
be
a
huge
glossary
that
we
have
to
issue
to
new
employee
no
one
can
actually
remember
all
these
acronym
and
people
don
t
want
to
seem
dumb
in
a
meeting
so
they
just
sit
there
in
ignorance
this
be
particularly
tough
on
new
employee
that
need
to
stop
immediately
or
i
will
take
drastic
action
i
have
give
enough
warning
over
the
year
unless
an
acronym
be
approve
by
me
it
should
not
enter
the
spacex
glossary
if
there
be
an
exist
acronym
that
cannot
reasonably
be
justified
it
should
be
eliminate
as
i
have
request
in
the
past
for
example
there
should
be
no
hts
horizontal
test
stand
or
vt
vertical
test
stand
designation
for
test
stand
those
be
particularly
dumb
as
they
contain
unnecessary
word
a
stand
at
our
test
site
be
obviously
a
test
stand
vt
be
four
syllable
compare
with
tripod
which
be
two
so
the
bloody
acronym
version
actually
take
longer
to
say
than
the
name
the
key
test
for
an
acronym
be
to
ask
whether
it
help
or
hurt
communication
an
acronym
that
most
engineer
outside
of
spacex
already
know
such
as
gui
be
fine
to
use
it
be
also
ok
to
make
up
a
few
acronym
contraction
every
now
and
again
assume
i
have
approve
them
eg
mvac
and
m
instead
of
merlin
c
vacuum
or
merlin
c
sea
level
but
those
need
to
be
kept
to
a
minimum
this
be
classic
musk
the
e
mail
be
rough
in
its
tone
and
yet
not
really
unwarranted
for
a
guy
who
just
want
thing
do
as
efficiently
as
possible
it
ob
over
something
that
other
people
might
find
trivial
and
yet
he
have
a
definite
point
it
s
comical
in
that
musk
want
all
acronym
approval
to
run
directly
through
him
but
that
s
entirely
in
keep
with
the
hand
on
management
style
that
have
mainly
work
well
at
both
spacex
and
tesla
employee
have
since
dubbed
the
acronym
policy
the
as
rule
the
guide
principle
at
spacex
be
to
embrace
your
work
and
get
stuff
do
people
who
await
guidance
or
detailed
instruction
languish
the
same
go
for
worker
who
crave
feedback
and
the
absolute
bad
thing
that
someone
can
do
be
inform
musk
that
what
he
s
ask
be
impossible
an
employee
could
be
tell
musk
that
there
s
no
way
to
get
the
cost
on
something
like
that
actuator
down
to
where
he
want
it
or
that
there
be
simply
not
enough
time
to
build
a
part
by
musk
s
deadline
elon
will
say
fine
you
re
off
the
project
and
i
be
now
the
ceo
of
the
project
i
will
do
your
job
and
be
ceo
of
two
company
at
the
same
time
i
will
deliver
it
brogan
say
what
s
crazy
be
that
elon
actually
do
it
every
time
he
s
fire
someone
and
take
their
job
he
s
deliver
on
whatever
the
project
be
it
be
jarring
for
both
party
when
the
spacex
culture
rub
against
more
bureaucratic
body
like
nasa
the
u
s
air
force
and
the
federal
aviation
administration
the
first
inkling
of
these
difficulty
appear
on
kwaj
where
government
official
sometimes
question
what
they
saw
as
spacex
s
cavalier
approach
to
the
launch
process
there
be
time
when
spacex
would
want
to
make
a
change
to
its
launch
procedure
and
any
such
change
would
require
a
pile
of
paperwork
spacex
for
example
would
have
write
down
all
the
step
need
to
replace
a
filter
put
on
glove
wear
safety
goggles
remove
a
nut
and
then
want
to
alter
this
procedure
or
use
a
different
type
of
filter
the
faa
would
need
a
week
to
review
the
new
process
before
spacex
could
actually
go
about
change
the
filter
on
the
rocket
a
lag
that
both
the
engineer
and
musk
found
ridiculous
on
one
occasion
after
this
type
of
thing
happen
musk
laid
into
an
faa
official
while
on
a
conference
call
with
member
of
the
spacex
team
and
nasa
it
get
hot
and
heat
and
he
berate
this
guy
on
a
personal
level
for
like
ten
minute
brogan
say
musk
do
not
recall
this
incident
but
do
remember
other
confrontation
with
the
faa
one
time
he
compile
a
list
of
thing
an
faa
subordinate
have
say
during
a
meeting
that
musk
found
silly
and
sent
the
list
along
to
the
guy
s
bos
and
then
his
dingbat
manager
sent
me
this
long
e
mail
about
how
he
have
be
in
the
shuttle
program
and
in
charge
of
twenty
launch
or
something
like
that
and
how
dare
i
say
that
the
other
guy
be
wrong
musk
say
i
told
him
not
only
be
he
wrong
and
let
me
rearticulate
the
reason
but
you
re
wrong
and
let
me
articulate
the
reason
i
don
t
think
he
sent
me
another
e
mail
after
that
we
re
try
to
have
a
really
big
impact
on
the
space
industry
if
the
rule
be
such
that
you
can
t
make
progress
then
you
have
to
fight
the
rule
there
be
a
fundamental
problem
with
regulator
if
a
regulator
agrees
to
change
a
rule
and
something
bad
happens
they
could
easily
lose
their
career
whereas
if
they
change
a
rule
and
something
good
happens
they
don
t
even
get
a
reward
so
it
s
very
asymmetric
it
s
then
very
easy
to
understand
why
regulator
resist
change
the
rule
it
s
because
there
s
a
big
punishment
on
one
side
and
no
reward
on
the
other
how
would
any
rational
person
behave
in
such
a
scenario
in
the
middle
of
spacex
hire
ken

as
its

a
degree
in
aerospace

a

good

constant
pull

at

between
do
thing
efficiently
and
agonize
over
traditional
procedure
he
and
musk
be
increasingly
at
odds
as
the
month
pass
and
bowersox
start
to
feel
as
if
his
opinion
be
be
ignore
during
one
incident
in
particular
a
part
make
it
all
the
way
to
the
test
stand
with
a
major
flaw
described
by
one
engineer
as
the
equivalent
of
a
coffee
cup
not
have
a
bottom
instead
of
be
caught
at
the
factory
accord
to
observer
bowersox
argue
that
spacex
should
go
back
and
investigate
the
process
that
lead
to
the
mistake
and
fix
its
root
cause
musk
have
already
decide
that
he
knew
the
basis
of
the
problem
and
dismiss
bowersox
after
a
couple
of
year
on
the
job
bowersox
decline
to
speak
on
the
record
about
his
time
at
spacex
a
number
of
people
inside
spacex
saw
the
bowersox
incident
as
an
example
of
musk
s
hard
charge
manner
undermine
some
much
need
process
musk
have
a
totally
different
take
on
the
situation
cast
bowersox
as
not
be
up
to
the
engineering
demand
at
spacex
a
handful
of
high
rank
government
official
give
me
their
candid
take
on
musk
albeit
without
be
willing
to
put
their
name
to
the
remark
one
found
musk
s
treatment
of
air
force
general
and
military
men
of
similar
rank
appal
musk
have
be
know
to
let
even
high
rank
official
have
it
when
he
think
they
re
off
base
and
be
not
apologetic
about
this
another
could
not
believe
it
when
musk
would
call
very
intelligent
people
idiot
imagine
the
bad
possible
way
that
could
come
out
and
it
would
come
out
this
person
say
life
with
elon
be
like
be
in
a
very
intimate
married
couple
he
can
be
so
gentle
and
loyal
and
then
really
hard
on
people
when
it
isn
t
necessary
one
former
official
felt
that
musk

the
conciliator
these
skill
have
allow
her
to
handle
the

not
express
a

science
and
knew
only
one
version
of
an

then
she
take

found
that
there
be
two

idle
because
none
of
the
veteran
knew
how
to
use
them
a
short
while
later
she
log
onto
the
computer
and
set
them
up
to
run
computational
fluid
dynamic
or
cfd
operation
to
simulate
the
performance
of
valve
and
other
component
the
work
kept

the

another
go
to
the
university

group
it
take
about
thirty
minute
to
make
it
all
the
way
around
the

the
student
be
at

by

enthusiasm
among
the
most
impressive

competitive
threat
and
she
reply
with
a

of
earnest
answer
and
rah
rah
stuff
shotwell
make
sure
to
emphasize
the
lean
innovative
edge
spacex
have
over
the
more
traditional
aerospace
company
our
competitor
be
scar
shitless
of
us
shotwell
told
the
group
the
behemoth
be
go
to
have
to
figure
out
how
to
get
it
together
and
compete
and
it
be
our
job
to
have
them
die
one
of
spacex
s
big
goal
shotwell
say
be
to
fly
as
often
as
possible
the
company
have
never
sought
to
make
a
fortune
off
each
flight
it
would
rather
make
a
little
on
each
launch
and
keep
the
flight
flow
a
falcon
flight
cost
million
and
the
company
would
like
to
see
that
figure
drop
to
about
million
through
economy
of
scale
and
improvement
in
launch
technology
spacex
spent
billion
to
get
four
dragon
capsule
to
the
i
nine
flight
with
the
falcon
and
five
flight
with
the
falcon
it
s
a
price
per
launch
total
that
the
rest
of
the
player
in
the
industry
cannot
comprehend
let
alone
aspire
to
i
don
t
know
what
those
guy
do
with
their
money
shotwell
say
they
be
smoking
it
i
just
don
t
know
as
shotwell
saw
it
a
number
of
new
nation
be
show
interest
in
launch
eye
communication
technology
as
essential
to
grow
their
economy
and
leveling
their
status
with
developed
nation
cheaper
flight
would
help
spacex
take
the
majority
of
the
business
from
that
new
customer
set
the
company
also
expect
to
participate
in
an
expand
market
for
human
flight
spacex
have
never
have
any
interest
in
do
the
five
minute
tourist
flight
to
low
earth
orbit
like
virgin
galactic
and
xcor
it
do
however
have
the
ability
to
carry
researcher
to
orbit
habitat
be
built
by
bigelow
aerospace
and
to
orbit
science
lab
be
construct
by
various
country
spacex
will
also
start
make
its
own
satellite
turn
the
company
into
a
one
stop
space
shop
all
of
these
plan
hinge
on
spacex
be
able
to
prove
that
it
can
fly
on
schedule
every
month
and
churn
through
the
billion
backlog
of
launch
most
of
our
customer
sign
up
early
and
want
to
be
supportive
and
get
good
deal
on
their
mission
she
say
we
be
in
a
phase
now
where
we
need
to
launch
on
time
and
make
launch
dragon
more
efficient
for
a
short
while
the
conversation
with
the
intern
bogged
down
it
turn
to
some
of
the
annoyance
of
spacex
s
campus
the
company
lease
its
facility
and
have
not
be
able
to
build
thing
like
a
massive
parking
structure
that
would
make
life
easy
for
its
three
thousand
person
workforce
shotwell
promise
that
more
parking
more
bathroom
and
more
of
the
freebie
that
technology
start
ups
in
silicon
valley
offer
their
employee
would
be
on
the
way
i
want
a
day
care
she
say
but
it
be
while
discuss
spacex
s
grandest
mission
that
shotwell
really
come
into
her
own
and
seem
to
inspire
the
intern
some
of
them
clearly
dream
of
become
astronaut
and
shotwell
say
that
work
at
spacex
be
almost
certainly
their
best
chance
to
get
to
space
now
that
nasa
s
astronaut
corp
have
dwindle
musk
have
make
design
cool
look
non
stay
puft
spacesuit
a
personal
priority
they
can
t
be
clunky
and
nasty
shotwell
say
you
have
to
do
well
than
that
as
for
where
the
astronaut
would
go
well
there
be
the
space
habitat
the
moon
and
of
course
mar
as
option
spacex
have
already
start
test
a
giant
rocket
call
the
falcon
heavy
that
will
take
it
much
farther
into
space
than
the
falcon
and
it
have
another
even
large
spaceship
on
the
way
our
falcon
heavy
rocket
will
not
take
a
busload
of
people
to
mar
she
say
so
there
s
something
after
heavy
we
re
work
on
it
to
make
something
like
that
vehicle
happen
she
say
the
spacex
employee
need
to
be
effective
and
pushy
make
sure
your
output
be
high
shotwell
say
if
we
re
throw
a
bunch
of
shit
in
your
way
you
need
to
be
mouthy
about
it
that
s
not
a
quality
that
s
widely
accepted
elsewhere
but
it
be
at
spacex
and
if
that
sound
harsh
so
be
it
as
shotwell
saw
it
the
commercial
space
race
be
come
down
to
spacex
and
china
and
that
s
it
and
in
the
big
picture
the
race
be
on
to
ensure
man
s
survival
if
you
hate
people
and
think
human
extinction
be
okay
then
fuck
it
shotwell
say
don
t
go
to
space
if
you
think
it
be
worth
human
do
some
risk
management
and
find
a
second
place
to
go
live
then
you
should
be
focus
on
this
issue
and
willing
to
spend
some
money
i
be
pretty
sure
we
will
be
select
by
nasa
to
drop
lander
and
rover
off
on
mar
then
the
first
spacex
mission
will
be
to
drop
off
a
bunch
of
supply
so
that
once
people
get
there
there
will
be
place
to
live
and
food
to
eat
and
stuff
for
them
to
do
it
s
talk
like
this
that
thrill
and
amazes
people
in
the
aerospace
industry
who
have
long
be
hop
that
some
company
would
come
along
and
truly
revolutionize
space
travel
aeronautics
expert
will
point
out
that
twenty
year
after
the
wright
brother
start
their
experiment
air
travel
have
become
routine
the
launch
business
by
contrast
appear
to
have
frozen
we
ve
be
to
the
moon
sent
research
vehicle
to
mar
and
explore
the
solar
system
but
all
of
these
thing
be
still
immensely
expensive
one
off
project
the
cost
remains
extraordinarily
high
because
of
the
rocket
equation
say
carol
stoker
the
planetary
scientist
at
nasa
thanks
to
military
and
government
contract
from
agency
like
nasa
the
aerospace
industry
have
historically
have
massive
budget
to
work
with
and
try
to
make
the
big
most
reliable
machine
it
could
the
business
have
be
tune
to
strive
for
maximum
performance
so
that
the
aerospace
contractor
can
say
they
met
their
requirement
that
strategy
make
sense
if
you
re
try
to
send
up
a
billion
military
satellite
for
the
u
s
government
and
simply
cannot
afford
for
the
payload
to
blow
up
but
on
the
whole
this
approach
stifle
the
pursuit
of
other
endeavor
it
lead
to
bloat
and
excess
and
a
cripple
of
the
commercial
space
industry
outside
of
spacex
the
american
launch
provider
be
no
longer
competitive
against
their
peer
in
other
country
they
have
limited
launch
ability
and
questionable
ambition
spacex
s
main
competitor
for
domestic
military
satellite
and
other
large
payload
be
united
launch
alliance
ula
a
joint
venture
form
in
when
boeing
and
lockheed
martin
combine
force
the
think
at
the
time
about
the
union
be
that
the
government
do
not
have
enough
business
for
two
company
and
that
combine
the
research
and
manufacturing
work
of
boeing
and
lockheed
would
result
in
cheaper
safer
launch
ula
have
lean
on
decade
of
work
around
the
delta
boeing
and
atlas
lockheed
launch
vehicle
and
have
flown
many
dozen
of
rocket
successfully
make
it
a
model
of
reliability
but
neither
the
joint
venture
nor
boeing
nor
lockheed
both
of
which
can
offer
commercial
service
on
their
own
come
close
to
compete
on
price
against
spacex
the
russian
or
the
chinese
for
the
most
part
the
global
commercial
market
be
dominate
by
arianespace
europe
long
march
china
or
russian
vehicle
say
dave
bearden
the
general
manager
of
civil
and
commercial
program
at
the
aerospace
corporation
there
be
just
different
labor
rate
and
difference
in
the
way
they
be
built
to
put
thing
more
bluntly
ula
have
turn
into
an
embarrassment
for
the
united
state
in
march
ula
s
then
ceo
michael
gas
face
off
against
musk
during
a
congressional
hearing
that
dealt
in
part
with
spacex
s
request
to
take
on
more
of
the
government
s
annual
launch
load
a
series
of
slide
be
roll
out
that
show
how
the
government
payment
for
launch
have
skyrocket
since
boeing
and
lockheed
go
from
a
duopoly
to
a
monopoly
accord
to
musk
s
math
present
at
the
hearing
ula
charge
million
per
flight
while
spacex
would
charge
million
per
flight
the
million
figure
be
high
than
spacex
s
standard
million
because
the
government
have
certain
additional
requirement
for
particularly
sensitive
launch
by
simply
pick
spacex
as
its
launch
provider
musk
point
out
the
government
would
save
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
satellite
go
on
the
rocket
gas
have
no
real
retort
he
claimed
musk
s
figure
for
the
ula
launch
price
be
inaccurate
but
fail
to
provide
a
figure
of
his
own
the
hearing
also
come
as
tension
between
the
united
state
and
russia
be
run
high
due
to
russia
s
aggressive
action
in
ukraine
musk
rightly
note
that
the
united
state
could
soon
be
place
sanction
on
russia
that
could
carry
over
to
aerospace
equipment
ula
as
it
happens
relies
on
russian
make
engine
to
send
up
sensitive
u
s
military
equipment
in
its
atlas
v
rocket
our
falcon
and
falcon
heavy
launch
vehicle
be
truly
american
musk
say
we
design
and
manufacture
our
rocket
in
california
and
texas
gas
counter
that
ula
have
bought
a
two
year
supply
of
russian
engine
and
purchase
the
blueprint
to
the
machine
and
have
them
translate
from
russian
to
english
and
he
say
this
with
a
straight
face
a
few
month
after
the
hearing
ula
replace
gas
as
ceo
and
sign
a
deal
with
blue
origin
to
develop
american
make
rocket
some
of
the
most
dishearten
moment
of
the
hearing
arrive
when
senator
richard
shelby
of
alabama
take
the
microphone
for
question
ula
have
manufacturing
facility
in
alabama
and
close
tie
to
the
senator
shelby
felt
compel
to
play
the
role
of
hometown
booster
by
repeatedly
point
out
that
ula
have
enjoy
sixty
eight
successful
launch
and
then
ask
musk
what
he
make
of
that
accomplishment
the
aerospace
industry
stand
as
one
of
shelby
s
big
donor
and
he
s
end
up
surprisingly
pro
bureaucracy
and
anticompetition
when
it
come
to
get
thing
into
space
typically
competition
result
in
well
quality
and
low
price
contract
but
the
launch
market
be
not
typical
shelby
say
it
be
limited
demand
frame
by
government
industrial
policy
the
march
hearing
in
which
shelby
make
these
statement
would
turn
out
to
be
something
of
a
sham
the
government
have
agree
to
put
fourteen
of
its
sensitive
launch
up
for
bid
instead
of
just
award
them
directly
to
ula
musk
have
come
to
congress
to
present
his
case
for
why
spacex
make
sense
as
a
viable
candidate
for
those
and
other
launch
the
day
after
the
hearing
the
air
force
cut
the
number
of
launch
up
for
bid
from
fourteen
to
between
seven
and
one
one
month
later
spacex
file
a
lawsuit
against
the
air
force
ask
for
a
chance
to
earn
its
launch
business
spacex
be
not
seek
to
be
award
contract
for
these
launch
the
company
say
on
its
freedomtolaunch
com
website
we
be
simply
seek
the
right
to
compete

it

orbital

on
supplier
include
russian

ukrainian
company
for
its

body
make
it
more
of
an
assembler
of
spacecraft
than
a
true
builder
like
spacex
and
also
unlike
spacex
orbital
s
capsule
cannot
withstand
the
journey
back
from
the

to

so
it
s
unable

in

reach
out

if

have
any
extra
capacity
to
take
care
of
some
of

customer
the

also

that
it
would
move
away
from
use

as
well
as
for
get
human

spacex
and
boeing
be
the
victor
in
a
four
year
nasa
competition
to
fly

to
the

replace
the

shuttle
and
restore
the
united

ability
to
conduct

i
actually
don
t
mind
that
boeing
get
twice
as
much
money
for
meeting
the
same
nasa
requirement
as
spacex
with
bad
technology
musk
say
have
two
company
involve
be
well
for
the
advancement
of
human
spaceflight
spacex
have
once
look
like
it
too
would
be
a
one
trick
pony
the
company
s
original
plan
be
to
have
the
smallish
falcon
function
as
its
primary
workhorse
at
million
to
million
per
flight
the
falcon
be
by
far
the
cheapest
mean
of
get
something
into
orbit
thrill
people
in
the
space
industry
when
google
announce
its
lunar
x
prize
in
million
in
award
to
people
who
could
land
a
robot
on
the
moon
many
of
the
proposal
that
follow
select
the
falcon
as
their
prefer
launch
vehicle
because
it
seem
like
the
only
reasonably
price
option
for
get
something
to
the
moon
scientist
around
the
world
be
equally
excite
think
that
for
the
first
time
they
have
a
mean
of
place
experiment
into
orbit
in
a
cost
effective
way
but
for
all
the
enthusiastic
talk
about
the
falcon
the
demand
never
arrive
it
become
very
clear
that
there
be
a
huge
need
for
the
falcon
but
no
money
for
it
say
shotwell
the
market
have
to
be
able
to
sustain
a
certain
amount
of
vehicle
and
three
falcon
s
per
year
do
not
make
a
business
the
last
falcon
launch
take
place
in
july
from
kwajalein
when
spacex
carry
a
satellite
into
orbit
for
the
malaysian
government
people
in
the
aerospace
industry
have
be
grumble
ever
since
we
give
falcon
a
hell
of
a
shot
shotwell
say
i
be
emotional
about
it
and
disappointed
i
d
anticipate
a
flood
of
order
but
after
eight
year
they
just
do
not
come
spacex
have
since
expand
its
launch
capability
at
a
remarkable
pace
and
look
like
it
might
be
on
the
verge
of
get
that
million
per
flight
option
back
in
june
the
falcon
flew
for
the
first
time
and
orbit
earth
successfully
in
december
spacex
prove
that
the
falcon
could
carry
the
dragon
capsule
into
space
and
that
the
capsule
could
be
recover
safely
after
an
ocean
land
it
become
the
first
commercial
company
ever
to
pull
off
this
feat
then
in
may
spacex
go
through
the
most
significant
moment
in
the
company
s
history
since
that
first
successful
launch
on
kwajalein
on
may
at
a
m
a
falcon
rocket
take
off
from
the
kennedy
space
center
in
cape
canaveral
florida
the
rocket
do
its
yeoman
like
work
boost
dragon
into
space
then
the
capsule
s
solar
panel
fan
out
and
dragon
become
dependent
on
its
eighteen
draco
thruster

small
rocket
engine
to
guide
its
path
to
the
international

the

engineer
work
in
shift
some
of
them
sleep
on
cot
at
the
factory
as
it
take
the
capsule
three
day
for
dragon
to
make
its
journey
they
spent
most
of
the
time
observe
dragon
s
flight
and
check
to
see
that
its

plan
to
dock

a

on
the
twenty
fifth
but
as
the
capsule
approach
the

station
an
unexpected
glint
kept
throw
off
the
calculation
of
a
laser
use
to
measure
the
distance
between
dragon
and
the
i
i
remember
it
be
two
and
a
half
hour
of
struggle
shotwell
say
her
outfit
of
uggs
a
fishnet
sweater
and
legging
start
to
feel
like
pajama
as
the
night
wore
on
and
the
engineer
battle
this
unplanned
difficulty
fear
all
the
time
that
the
mission
would
be
aborted
spacex
decide
to
upload
some
new
software
to
the
dragon
that
would
cut
the
size
of
the
visual
frame
use
by
the
sensor
to
eliminate
the
effect
of
the
sunlight
on
the
machine
then
just
before
a
m
dragon
get
close
enough
to
the
i
for
don
pettit
an
astronaut
to
use
a
fifty
eight
foot
robotic
arm
to
reach
out
and
grab
the
resupply
capsule
houston
station
it
look
like
we
ve
get
us
a
dragon
by
the
tail
pettit
say
i
d
be
digest
my

shotwell
say
and
then

there

the

other
space

automatically
without

the
intervention
of

it
will
run
on
a
superdraco

a
thruster
make
by

and
the
first
engine
ever
built
completely
by

and
most
mind
boggling
of
all
musk
reveal
that
the
dragon
will
be
able
to
land
anywhere
on

that
spacex
want
by
use
the

gentle
stop
on

no

no
more
throw
spaceship
away
that
be
how
a
twenty
first
century
spaceship
should
land
musk
say
you
can
just
reload
propellant
and
fly
again
so
long
as
we
continue
to
throw
away
rocket
and
spacecraft
we
will
never
have
true
access
to
space
the
dragon
be
just
one
of
the
machine
that
spacex
continue
to
develop
in
parallel
one
of
the
company
s
next
milestone
will
be
the
first
flight
of
the
falcon
heavy
which
be
design
to
be
the
world
s
most
powerful
rocket
spacex
have
found
a
way
to
combine
three
falcon
s
into
a
single
craft
with
of
the
merlin
engine
and
the
ability
to
carry
more
than
metric
ton
of
stuff
into
orbit
part
of
the
genius
of
musk
and
mueller
s
design
be
that
spacex
can
reuse
the
same
engine
in
different
configuration
from
the
falcon
up
to
the
falcon
heavy
save
on
cost
and
time
we
make
our
main
combustion
chamber
turbo
pump
gas
generator
injector
and
main
valve
mueller
say
we
have
complete
control
we
have
our
own
test
site
while
most
of
the
other
guy
use
government
test
site
the
labor
hour
be
cut
in
half
and
so
be
the
work
around
the
material
four
year
ago
we
could
make
two
rocket
a
year
and
now
we
can
make
twenty
a
year
spacex
boast
that
the
falcon
heavy
can
take
up
twice
the
payload
of
the
near
competitor
the
delta
iv
heavy
from
boeing
ula
at
one
third
the
cost
spacex
be
also
busy
building
a
spaceport
from
the

up
the
goal
be
to
be
able
to
launch

up
on
the
pad
fuel
it
and
send
it
off
just
as
it
do
in
the
early
day
spacex
continue
to
experiment
with
these
new
vehicle
during
actual
launch
in
way
that
other
company
would
dare
not
do
spacex
will
often
announce
that
it
s
try
out
a
new
engine
or
its
land
leg
and
place
the
emphasis
on
that
one
upgrade
in
the
marketing
material
lead
up
to
a
launch
it
s
common
though
for
spacex
to
test
out
a
dozen
other
objective
in
secret
during
a
mission
musk
essentially
asks
employee
to
do
the
impossible
on
top
of
the
impossible
one
former
spacex
executive
described
the
work
atmosphere
as
a
perpetual
motion
machine
that
run
on
a
weird
mix
of
dissatisfaction
and
eternal
hope
it
s
like
he
have
everyone
work
on
this
car
that
be
meant
to
get
from
los
angeles
to
new
york
on
one
tank
of
gas
this
executive
say
they
will
work
on
the
car
for
a
year
and
test
all
of
its
part
then
when
they
set
off
for
new
york
after
that
year
all
of
the
vice
president
think
privately
that
the
car
will
be
lucky
to
get
to
la
vega
what
end
up
happen
be
that
the
car
get
to
new
mexico
twice
as
far
as
they
ever
expect
and
elon
be
still
mad
he
get
twice
as
much
as
anyone
else
out
of
people
there
s
a
degree
to
which
it
s
just
never
enough
for
musk
no
matter
what
it
be
case
in
point
the
december
launch
in
which
spacex
get
the
dragon
capsule
to
orbit
earth
and
return
successfully
this
have
be
one
of
the
company
s
great
achievement
and
people
have
work
tirelessly
for
month
if
not
year
the
launch
have
take
place
on
december
and
spacex
have
a
christmas
party
on
december
about
ninety
minute
before
the
party
start
musk
have
call
his
top
executive
to
spacex
for
a
meeting
six
of
them
include
mueller
be
deck
out
in
party
attire
and
ready
to
celebrate
the
holiday
and
spacex

historic
achievement
around
dragon
musk
laid
into
them
for
about
an
hour

the

over

for
the

to
end
brogan
say
other
example
of
similar
behavior
have
cropped
up
from
time
to
time
musk
for
example
reward
a
group
of
thirty
employee
who
have
pull
off
a
tough
project
for
nasa
with
bonus
that
consist
of
additional
stock
option
grant
many
of
the
employee
seek
instant
more
tangible
gratification
demand
cash
he
chide
us
for
not
value
the
stock
drew
eldeen
a
former
engineer
say
he
say
in
the
long
run
this
be
worth
a
lot
more
than
a
thousand
dollar
in
cash
he
wasn
t
scream
or
anything
like
that
but
he
seem
disappointed
in
us
it
be
hard
to
hear
that
the
linger
question
for
many
spacex
employee
be
when
exactly
they
will
see
a
big
reward
for
all
their
work
spacex
s
staff
be
paid
well
but
by
no
mean
exorbitantly
many
of
them
expect
to
make
their
money
when
spacex
file
for
an
initial
public
offering
the
thing
be
that
musk
do
not
want
to
go
public
anytime
soon
and
understandably
so
it
s
a
bit
hard
to
explain
the
whole
mar
thing
to
investor
when
it
s
unclear
what
the
business
model
around
start
a
colony
on
another
planet
will
be
when
the
employee
heard
musk
say
that
an
ipo
be
year
away
and
would
not
occur
until
the
mar
mission
look
more
secure
they
start
to
grumble
and
when
musk
found
out
he
address
all
of
spacex
in
an
e
mail
that
be
a
fantastic
window
into
his
think
and
how
it
differs
from
almost
every
other
ceo
s
the
full
e
mail
appear
in
appendix
june
go
public
per
my
recent
comment
i
be
increasingly
concerned
about
spacex
go
public
before
the
mar
transport
system
be
in
place
create
the
technology
need
to
establish
life
on
mar
be
and
always
have
be
the
fundamental
goal
of
spacex
if
be
a
public
company
diminishes
that
likelihood
then
we
should
not
do
so
until
mar
be
secure
this
be
something
that
i
be
open
to
reconsider
but
give
my
experience
with
tesla
and
solarcity
i
be
hesitant
to
foist
be
public
on
spacex
especially
give
the
long
term
nature
of
our
mission
some
at
spacex
who
have
not
be
through
a
public
company
experience
may
think
that
be
public
be
desirable
this
be
not
so
public
company
stock
particularly
if
big
step
change
in
technology
be
involve
go
through
extreme
volatility
both
for
reason
of
internal
execution
and
for
reason
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
anything
except
the
economy
this
cause
people
to
be
distract
by
the
manic
depressive
nature
of
the
stock
instead
of
create
great
product
for
those
who
be
under
the
impression
that
they
be
so
clever
that
they
can
outsmart
public
market
investor
and
would
sell
spacex
stock
at
the
right
time
let
me
relieve
you
of
any
such
notion
if
you
really
be
well
than
most
hedge
fund
manager
then
there
be
no
need
to
worry
about
the
value
of
your
spacex
stock
as
you
can
just
invest
in
other
public
company
stock
and
make
billion
of

in
the

the

of
the

there
be
so
many

for

that
it
s
easy
to
become
immune
to
them
and
ignore
what
s
take
place
in
the

that
s
okay
because
there
s
not
really
much
of

look
to
put
a
modicum
of

dance

in

the

slightly
less
miserable
than
usual
you
ll
start
to
appreciate
just
how
low
the
automotive
industry
have
sunk
in
the
middle
of
tesla

stun
its
complacent

the

this
all
electric
luxury

go
more
than
mile
on
a

it
could
reach
mile

in

seven

you
use
a

for
kid
it
also
have
two
trunk
there
be
the
standard
one
and
then
what
tesla
call
a
frunk
up
front
where
the
bulky
engine
would
usually
be
the
model
s
ran
on
an
electric
battery
pack
that

up
the

do
so
under
impossible
circumstance

the

whether

say
as
much
when
he
reflect
on
what

have
meant
to
the

push

so
much
farther
than
we
ever
imagine
he
say
as
difficult
as
birthing
the

have
be
the
adventure
have
whet
musk
s
appetite
for
what
he
could
accomplish
in
the
automotive
industry
with
a
clean
slate
tesla
s
next
car
code
name
whitestar

not

adapt
version
of
another

vehicle
it
would
be
make
from
scratch
and
structure
to
take
full
advantage
of
what
the
electric
car
technology
offer
the
battery
pack
in
the
roadster
for
example
have
to
be
place
near
the
rear
of
the
car
because
of
constraint
impose
by
the
lotus
elise
chassis
this
be
okay
but
not
ideal
due
to
the
impose
weight
of
the
battery
with
whitestar
which
would
become
the
model
s
musk
and
tesla
s
engineer
knew
from
the
start
that
they
would
place
the
pound
battery
pack
on
the
base
of
the
car
this
would
give
the
vehicle
a
low
center
of
gravity
and
excellent
handle
it
would
also
give
the
model
s
what
s
know
as
a
low
polar
moment
of
inertia
which
relates
to
how
a
car
resists
turn
ideally
you
want
heavy
part
like
the
engine
as
close
as
possible
to
the
car
s
center
of
gravity
which
be
why
the
engine
of
race
car
tend
to
be
near
the
middle
of
the
vehicle
traditional
car
be
a
mess
on
this
metric
with
the
bulky
engine
up
front
passenger
in
the
middle
and
gasoline
slosh
around
the
rear
in
the
case
of
the

the
bulk
of
the
car
s
mass
be
very
close
to
the

this
have
positive
follow
on

to
handle
performance
and
safety

innards

be
just
one

in

they
found
the

to

it

saw
firsthand
how
the
look
of

change
the
way
people
felt
about

sale
in
the

he
say
von

spent
eight
year
with
vw
climb
the
rank
of
its

fall
in
love
with

long
adore
its

almost
all
of
the

the

where
he
serve
as
the
company

director
of

taught
von

just
how
nasty
a
big
car
company
could
become
none
of
the
car
in
gm
s
lineup
really
excite
him
and
it
seem
near
impossible
to
make
a
large
impact
on
the
company
s
culture
he
be
one
member
of
a
thousand
person

team
that
divvyed
up
the
make

haphazardly
without
any
consideration

really
want
to
work
on
which
car
they
take
all
the
spirit
out
of
me
say
von

i
knew
i
didn
t
want
to
die
there
mazda
by
contrast
need
and
want
help
it
let
von

and
his
team
in
los

put
their
imprint
on
every
car
in
the
north
american
vehicle
lineup
and
to
produce
a
set
of
concept
car
that
reshaped
how
the
company
approach
design
as
von
holzhausen
put
it
we
brought
the
zoom
zoom
back
into
the
look
and
feel
of
the
car
von
holzhausen
start
a
project
to
make
mazda
s
car
more
green
by
revaluating
the
type
of
material
use
to
fabricate
the
seat
and
the
fuel
go
into
the
vehicle
he
have
in
fact
just
make
an
ethanol
base
concept
car
when
in
early
a
friend
told
him
that
tesla
need
a
chief
designer
after
play
phone
tag
for
a
month
with
musk
s
assistant
mary
beth
brown
to
inquire
about
the
position
von
holzhausen
finally
get
in
touch
and
met
musk
for
an
interview
at
the
spacex
headquarters
musk
instantly
saw
von
holzhausen
with
his
bouffant
trendy
clothes
and
laid
back
attitude
as
a
free
spirit
creative
complement
and
wooed
him
with
vigor
they
take
a
tour
of
the
spacex
factory
in
hawthorne
and
tesla
s
headquarters
in
silicon
valley
both
facility
be
chaotic
and
reek
of
start
up
musk
ramped
up
the
charm
and
sell
von
holzhausen
on
the
idea
that
he
have
a
chance
to
shape
the
future
of
the
automobile
and
that
it
make
sense
to
leave
his
cushy
job
at
a
big
proven
automaker
for
this
once
in
a
lifetime
opportunity
elon
and
i
go
for
a
drive
in
the
roadster
and
everyone
be
check
it
out
von
holzhausen
say
i
knew
i
could
stay
at
mazda
for
ten
year
and
get
very
comfortable
or
take
a
huge
leap
of
faith
at
tesla
there
be
no
history
no
baggage
there
be
just
a
vision
of
product
that
could
change
the
world
who
wouldn
t
want
to
be
involve
with
that
while
von
holzhausen
knew
the
risk
of
go
to
a
startup
he
could
not
have
realize
just
how
close
tesla
be
to
bankruptcy
when
he
join
the
company
in
august
musk
have
coaxed
von
holzhausen
away
from
a
secure
job
and
into
the
jaw
of
death
but
in
many
way
this
be
what
von
holzhausen
sought
at
this
point
in
his
career
tesla
do
not
feel
as
much
like
a
car
company
as
a
bunch
of
guy
tinker
on
a
big
idea
to
me
it
be
excite
he
say
it
be
like
a
garage
experiment
and
it
make
car
cool
again
the
suit
be
go
and
so
be
the
veteran
automotive
hand
dull
by
year
work
in
the
industry
in
their
stead
von
holzhausen
found
energetic
geek
who
didn
t
realize
that
what
they
want
to
do
be
borderline
impossible
musk
s
presence
add
to
the
energy
and
give
von
holzhausen
confidence
that
tesla
actually
could
outflank
much
much
large
competitor
elon
s
mind
be
always
way
beyond
the
present
moment
he
say
you
could
see
that
he
be
a
step
or
three
ahead
of
everyone
else
and
one
hundred
percent
commit
to
what
we
be
do
von
holzhausen
have
examine
the
drawing
of
the
model
s
left
by
fisker
and
a
clay
model
of
the
car
and
have
come
away
unimpressed
it
be
a
blob
he
say
it
be
clear
to
me
that
the
people
that
have
be
work
on
this
be
novice
musk
realize
the
same
thing
and
try
to
articulate
what
he
want
even
though
the
word
be
not
precise
they
be
good
enough
to
give
von
holzhausen
a
feel
for
musk
s
vision
and
the
confidence
that
he
could
deliver
on
it
i
say
we
re
go
to
start
over
we
re
go
to
work
together
and
make
this
awesome
to
save
money
the
tesla
design
center
come
to
life
inside
the
spacex
factory
a
handful
of
people
on
von
holzhausen
s
team
take
over
one
corner
and
put
up
a
tent
to
add
some
separation
and
secrecy
to
what
they
be
do
in
the
tradition
of
many
a
musk
employee
von
holzhausen
have
to
build
his
own
office
he
make
a
pilgrimage
to
ikea
to
buy
some
desk
and
then
go
to
an
art
store
to
get
some
paper
and
pen
as
von
holzhausen
begin
sketch
the
outside
of
the
model
s
the
tesla
engineer
have
start
up
a
project
to
build
another
electric
cl
they
ripped
this
one
down
to
its
very
core
remove
all
of
the
body
structure
and
then
stretch
the
wheelbase
by
four
inch
to
match
up
with
some
of
the
early
model

specification
thing
begin
move
fast
for
everyone
involve
in
the
model
s
project
in
the
span
of
about
three
month
von
holzhausen
have
design
percent
of
what
people
see
today
with
the
model
s
and
the
engineer
have
start
building
a
prototype
exterior
around
the
skeleton
throughout
this
process
von
holzhausen
and
musk
talk
every
day
their
desk
be
close
and
the
men
have
a
natural
rapport
musk
say
he
want
an
aesthetic
that
borrow
from
aston
martin
and
porsche
and
some
specific
function
he
insist
for
example
that
the
car
seat
seven
people
it
be
like
holy
shit
how
do
we
pull
this
off
in
a
sedan
von
holzhausen
say
but
i
understood
he
have
five
kid
and
want
something
that
could
be
thought
of
as
a
family
vehicle
and
he
knew
other
people
would
have
this
issue
musk
want
to
make
another
statement
with
a
huge
touchscreen
this
be
year
before
the
ipad
would
be
release
the
touch
screen
that
people
ran
into
now
and
again
at
airport
or
shopping
kiosk
be
for
the
most
part
terrible
but
to
musk
the
iphone
and
all
of
its
touch
function
make
it
obvious
that
this
type
of
technology
would
soon
become
commonplace
he
would
make
a
giant
iphone
and
have
it
handle
most
of
the
car
s
function
to
find
the
right
size
for
the
screen
musk
and
von
holzhausen
would
sit
in
the
skeleton
car
and
hold
up
laptop
of
different
size
place
them
horizontally
and
vertically
to
see
what
look
best
they
settle
on
a
seventeen
inch
screen
in
a
vertical
position
driver
would
tap
on
this
screen
for
every
task
except
for
opening
the
glove
box
and
turn
on
the
emergency
light
job
require
by
law
to
be
perform
with
physical
button
since
the
battery
pack
at
the
base
of
the
car
would
weigh
so
much
musk
the
designer
and
the
engineer
be
always
look
for
way
to
reduce
the
model
s
s
weight
in
other
spot
musk
opt
to
solve
a
big
chunk
of
this
problem
by
make
the
body
of
the
model
s
out
of
lightweight
aluminum
instead
of
steel
the
non
battery
pack
portion
of
the
car
have
to
be
lighter
than
comparable
gasoline
car
and
make
it
all
aluminum
become
the
obvious
decision
musk
say
the
fundamental
problem
be
that
if
we
didn
t
make
it
out
of
aluminum
the
car
wasn
t
go
to
be
any
good
musk
s
word
choice
there
obvious
decision
go
a
long
way
toward
explain
how
he
operates
yes
the
car
need
to
be
light
and
yes
aluminum
would
be
an
option
for
make
that
happen
but
at
the
time
car
manufacturer
in
north
america
have
almost
no
experience
produce
aluminum
body
panel
aluminum
tends
to
tear
when
work
by
large
press
it
also
develops
line
that
look
like
stretch
mark
on
skin
and
make
it
difficult
to
lay
down
smooth
coat
of
paint
in
europe
you
have
some
jaguar
and
one
audi
that
be
make
of
aluminum
but
it
be
less
than
five
percent
of
the
market
musk
say
in
north
america
there
be
nothing
it
s
only
recently
that
the
ford
f
have
arrive
as
mostly
aluminum
before
that
we
be
the
only
one
inside
of
tesla
attempt
be
repeatedly
make
to
talk
musk
out
of
the
aluminum
body
but
he
would
not
budge
see
it
as
the
only
rational
choice
it
would
be
up
to
the
tesla
team
to
figure
out
how
to
make
the
aluminum
manufacturing
happen
we
knew
it
could
be
do
musk
say
it
be
a
question
of
how
hard
it
would
be
and
how
long
it
would
take
us
to
sort
it
out
just
about
all
of
the
major
design
choice
with
the

come
with
similar
challenge
when
we
first
talk
about
the
touch
screen
the
guy
come
back
and
say
there
s
nothing
like
that
in
the
automotive
supply
chain
musk
say
i
say
i
know
that
s
because
it
s
never
be
put
in
a
fuck
car
before
musk
figure
that
computer
manufacturer
have
ton
of
experience
make
seventeen
inch
laptop
screen
and
expect
them
to
knock
out
a
screen
for
the
model
s
with
relative
ease
the
laptop
be
pretty
robust
musk
say
you
can
drop
them
and
leave
them
out
in
the
sun
and
they
still
have
to
work
after
contact
the
laptop
supplier
tesla
s
engineer
come
back
and
say
that
the
temperature
and
vibration
load
for
the
computer
do
not
appear
to
be
up
to
automotive
standard
tesla
s
supplier
in
asia
also
kept
point
the
carmaker
to
its
automotive
division
instead
of
its
compute
division
as
musk
dug
into
the
situation
more
he
discover
that
the
laptop
screen
simply
have
not
be
test
before
under
the
tougher
automotive
condition
which
include
large
temperature
fluctuation
when
tesla
perform
the
test
the
electronics
end
up
work
just
fine
tesla
also
start
work
hand
in
hand
with
the
asian
manufacturer
to
perfect
their
then
immature
capacitive
touch
technology
and
to
find
way
to
hide
the
wiring
behind
the
screen
that
make
the
touch
technology
possible
i
m
pretty
sure
that
we
end
up
with
the
only
seventeen
inch
touch
screen
in
the
world
musk
say
none
of
the
computer
maker
or
apple
have
make
it
work
yet
the
tesla
engineer
be
radical
by
automotive
industry
standard
but
even
they
have
problem
fully
commit
to
musk
s
vision
they
want
to
put
in
a
bloody
switch
or
a
button
for
the
light
musk
say
why
would
we
need
a
switch
when
it
s
dark
turn
the
light
on
next
the
engineer
put
up
resistance
to
the
door
handle
musk
and
von
holzhausen
have
be
study
a
bunch
of
preliminary
design
in
which
the
handle
have
yet
to
be
drawn
in
and
start
to
fall
in
love
with
how
clean
the
car
look
they
decide
that
the
handle
should
only
present
themselves
when
a
passenger
need
to
get
in
the
car
right
away
the
engineer
realize
this
would
be
a
technological
pain
and
they
completely
ignore
the
idea
in
one
prototype
version
of
the
car
much
to
the
dismay
of
musk
and
von
holzhausen
this
prototype
have
the
handle
pivot
instead
of
pop
out
von
holzhausen
say
i
be
upset
about
it
and
elon
say
why
the
fuck
be
this
different
we
re
not
do
this
to
crank
up
the
pace
of
the
model
s
design
there
be
engineer
work
all
day
and
then
others
who
would
show
up
at
p
m
and
work
through
the
night
both
group
huddle
inside
of
the
square
foot
tent
place
on
the
spacex
factory
floor
their
workspace
look
like
a
reception
area
at
an
outdoor
wedding
the
spacex
guy
be
amazingly
respectful
and
didn
t
peek
or
ask
question
say
ali
javidan
one
of
the
main
engineer
as
von
holzhausen
deliver
his
specification
the
engineer
built
the
prototype
body
of
the
car
every
friday
afternoon
they
brought
what
they
have
make
into
a
courtyard
behind
the
factory
where
musk
would
look
it
over
and
provide
feedback
to
run
test
on
the
body
the
car
would
be
load
up
with
ballast
to
represent
five
people
and
then
do
loop
around
the
factory
until
it
overheat
or
broke
down
the
more
von
holzhausen
learn
about
tesla
s
financial
struggle
the
more
he
want
the
public
to
see
the
model
s
thing
be
so
precarious
and
i
didn
t
want
to
miss
our
opportunity
to
get
this
thing
finish
and
show
it
to
the
world
he
say
that
moment
come
in
march
when
just
six
month
after
von
holzhausen
have
arrive
tesla
unveiled
the
model
s
at
a
press
event
held
at
spacex
amid
rocket
engine
and
hunk
of
aluminum
tesla
showcased
a
gray
model
s
sedan
from
a
distance
the
display
model
look
glamorous
and
refine
the
medium
report
from
the
day
described
the
car
as
the
love
child
of
an
aston
martin
and
a
maserati
in
reality
the
sedan
barely
held
together
it
still
have
the
base
structure
of
a
mercedes
cl
although
no
one
in
the
press
knew
that
and
some
of
the
body
panel
and
the
hood
be
stuck
to
the
frame
with
magnet
they
could
just
slide
the
hood
right
off
say
bruce
leak
a
tesla
owner
invite
to
attend
the
event
it
wasn
t
really
attach
they
would
put
it
back
on
and
try
and
align
it
to
get
the
fit
and
finish
right
but
then
someone
would
push
on
it
and
it
would
move
again
it
be
one
of
those
wizard
of
oz
man
behind
the
curtain
moment
a
couple
of
the
tesla
engineer
practice
test
drive
the
car
for
a
couple
of
day
lead
up
to
the
event
to
make
sure
that
they
knew
just
how
long
the
car
would
go
before
it
overheat
while
not
perfect
the
display
accomplish
exactly
what
musk
have
intend
it
remind
people
that
tesla
have
a
credible
plan
to
make
electric
car
more
mainstream
and
that
its
car
be
far
more
ambitious
than
what
big
time
automaker
like
gm
and
nissan
seem
to
have
in
mind
both
from
a
design
and
a
range
perspective
the
messy
reality
behind
the
display
be
that
the
odds
of
tesla
advance
the
model
s
from
a
prop
to
a
sellable
car
be
infinitesimal
the
company
have
the
technical
know
how
and
the
will
for
the
job
it
just
didn
t
have
much
money
or
a
factory
that
could
crank
out
car
by
the
thousand
building
an
entire
car
would
require
blanking
machine
that
take
sheet
of
aluminum
and
chop
them
up
into
the
appropriate
size
for
door
hood
and
body
panel
next
up
would
be
the
massive
stamp
machine
and
metal
dy
use
to
take
the
aluminum
and
bend
it
into
precise
shape
then
there
would
be
dozen
of
robot
that
would
aid
in
assemble
the
car
computer
control
milling
machine
for
precise
metalwork
painting
equipment
and
a
bevy
of
other
machine
for
run
test
it
be
an
investment
that
would
run
into
the
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
musk
would
also
need
to
hire
thousand
of
worker
as
with
spacex
musk
prefer
to
build
as
much
of
tesla
s
vehicle
in
house
as
possible
but
the
high
cost
be
limit
just
how
much
tesla
could
take
on
the
original
plan
be
that
we
would
do
final
assembly
say
diarmuid
o
connell
the
vice
president
of
business
development
at
tesla
partner
would
stamp
out
the
body
part
do
the
weld
and
handle
the
painting
and
ship
everything
to
tesla
where
worker
would
turn
the
part
into
a
whole
car
tesla
propose
to
build
a
factory
to
handle
this
type
of
work
first
in
albuquerque
new
mexico
and
then
later
in
san
jose
california
and
then
pull
back
on
these
proposal
much
to
the
dismay
of
city
official
in
both
locale
the
public
hem
and
haw
around
pick
the
factory
site
do
little
to
inspire
confidence
in
tesla
s
ability
to
knock
out
a
second
car
and
generate
the
same
type
of
negative
headline
that
have
surround
the
roadster
s
protract
delivery
o
connell
have
join
tesla
in
to
help
solve
some
of
the
factory
and
financing
issue
he
grow
up
near
boston
in
a
middle
class
irish
family
and
go
on
to
earn
a
bachelor
s
degree
from
dartmouth
college
after
that
o
connell
attend
the
university
of
virginia
to
get
a
master
s
degree
in
foreign
policy
and
then
northwestern
where
he
get
an
mba
from
the
kellogg
school
of
management
he
have
fancy
himself
a
scholar
of
the
soviet
union
and
its
foreign
and
economic
policy
and
have
study
these
area
at
uva
but
then
in
and
they
re
start
to
close
down
the
soviet
union
and
at
the
very
least
i
have
a
brand
problem
o
connell
say
it
start
look
to
me
like
i
be
head
to
a
career
in
academia
or
intelligence
it
be
then
that
o
connell
s
career
take
a
detour
into
the
business
world
where
he
become
a
management
consultant
work
for
mccann
erickson
worldwide
young
rubicam
and
accenture
advise
company
like
coca
cola
and
at
t
o
connell
s
career
path
change
more
drastically
in
when
the
plane
hit
the
twin
tower
in
new
york
in
the
wake
of
the
terrorist
attack
o
connell
like
many
people
decide
to
serve
the
united
state
in
any
capacity
that
he
could
in
his
late
thirty
he
have
miss
the
window
to
be
a
soldier
and
instead
focus
his
attention
on
try
to
get
into
national
security
work
o
connell
go
from
office
to
office
in
washington
d
c
look
for
a
job
and
have
little
luck
until
lincoln
bloomfield
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
political
military
affair
heard
him
out
bloomfield
need
someone
who
could
help
prioritize
mission
in
the
middle
east
and
make
sure
the
right
people
be
work
on
the
right
thing
and
he
figure
that
o
connell
s
management
consult
experience
make
him
a
nice
fit
for
the
job
o
connell
become
bloomfield
s
chief
of
staff
and
dealt
with
a
wide
range
of
charge
situation
from
trade
negotiation
to
set
up
an
embassy
in
baghdad
after
gain
security
clearance
o
connell
also
have
access
to
a
daily
report
that
collect
information
from
intelligence
and
military
personnel
on
the
status
of
operation
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
every
morning
at
six
a
m
the
first
thing
to
hit
my
desk
be
this
overnight
report
that
include
information
on
who
get
kill
and
what
kill
them
o
connell
say
i
kept
think
this
be
insane
why
be
we
in
this
place
it
be
not
just
iraq
but
the
whole
picture
why
be
we
so
invest
in
that
part
of
the
world
the
unsurprising
answer
that
o
connell
come
up
with
be
oil
the
more
o
connell
dug
into
the
united
state
dependence
on
foreign
oil
the
more
frustrate
and
despondent
he
become
my
client
be
basically
the
combat
commander
people
in
charge
of
latin
america
and
central
command
he
say
as
i
talk
with
them
and
study
and
research
i
realize
that
even
in
peacetime
so
many
of
our
asset
be
employ
to
support
the
economic
pipeline
around
oil
o
connell
decide
that
the
rational
thing
to
do
for
his
country
and
for
his
newborn
son
be
to
alter
this
equation
he
look
at
the
wind
industry
and
the
solar
industry
and
the
traditional
automaker
but
come
away
unconvinced
that
what
they
be
do
could
have
a
radical
enough
impact
on
the
status
quo
then
while
reading
businessweek
he
stumble
on
an
article
about
a
start
up
call
tesla
motor
and
go
to
the
company
s
website
which
described
tesla
as
a
place
where
we
be
do
thing
not
talk
about
thing
i
sent
an
e
mail
tell
them
i
have
come
from
the
national
security
area
and
be
really
passionate
about
reduce
our
dependence
on
oil
and
figure
it
be
just
a
dead
letter
type
of
thing
o
connell
say
i
get
an
e
mail
back
the
next
day
musk
hire
o
connell
and
quickly
dispatch
him
to
washington
d
c
to
start
poke
around
on
what
type
of
tax
credit
and
rebate
tesla
might
be
able
to
drum
up
around
its
electric
vehicle
at
the
same
time
o
connell
draft
an
application
for
a
department
of
energy
stimulus
package
all
i
knew
be
that
we
be
go
to
need
a
shitload
of
money
to
build
this
company
o
connell
say
my
view
be
that
we
need
to
explore
everything
tesla
have
be
look
for
between
million
and
million
grossly
underestimate
what
it
would
take
to
build
the
model
s
we
be
na
ve
and
learn
our
way
in
the
business
o
connell
say
it
january
tesla
take
over
porsche
s
usual
spot
at
the
detroit
auto
show
get
the
space
cheap
because
so
many
other
car
company
have
bail
out
on
the
event
fisker

no

the
technology
that
tesla

displayed
prove
good
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
big
boy
not
long
after
the
show
daimler
voiced
some
interest
in
see
what
an
electric
mercedes
a
class
car
might
look
and
feel
like
daimler
executive
say
they
would
visit
tesla
in
about
a
month
to
discus
this
proposition
in
detail
and
the
tesla
engineer
decide
to
blow
them
away
by
produce
two
prototype
vehicle
before
the
visit
when
the
daimler
executive
saw
what
tesla
have
do
they
order
four
thousand
of
tesla
s
battery
pack
for
a
fleet
of
test
vehicle
in
germany
the
tesla
team
pull
off
the
same
kind
of
feat
for
toyota
and
won
its
business
too
in
may
thing
start
to
take
off
for
tesla
the
model
s
have
be
unveiled
and
daimler
follow
that
by
acquire
a
percent
stake
in
tesla
for
million
the
company
also
form
a
strategic
partnership
to
have
tesla
provide
the
battery
pack
for
one
thousand
of
daimler
s
smart
car
that
money
be
important
and
go
a
long
way
back
then
say
o
connell
it
be
also
a
validation
here
be
the
company
that
invent
the
internal
combustion
engine
and
they
be
invest
in
us
it
be
a
seminal
moment
and
i
be
sure
it
give
the
guy
over
at
the
doe
the
feel
that
we
be
real
it
s
not
just
our
scientist
say
this
stuff
be
good
it
s
mercedes
freak
benz
sure
enough
in
january
the
department
of
energy
struck
a
million
loan
agreement
with
tesla
the
money
be
far
more
than
tesla
have
ever
expect
to
get
from
the
government
but
it
still
represent
just
a
fraction
of
the
billion
plus
that
most
carmaker
need
to
bring
a
new
vehicle
to
market
so
while
musk
and
o
connell
be
thrill
to
get
the
money
they
still
wonder
if
tesla
would
be
able
to
live
up
to
the
bargain
tesla
would
need
one
more
windfall
or
perhaps
to
steal
a
car
factory
and
in
may
that
s
more
or
less
what
it
do
general
motor
and
toyota
have
team
up
in
to
build
new
united
motor
manufacturing
inc

nummi
on
the

of

assembly
plant
in
fremont
california
a
city
on
the
outskirt
of
silicon
valley
the
company
hop
the
joint
facility
would
combine
the
best
of
american
and
japanese
automaking
skill
and
result
in
high
quality
cheaper
car
the
factory
go
on
to
pump
out
million
of
vehicle
like
the
chevy
nova
and
toyota

then
the
recession
hit
and
gm
found
itself
try
to
climb
out
of
bankruptcy
it
decide
to
abandon
the
plant
in
and
toyota
follow
right
after
say
it
would
close
down
the
whole
facility
leave
five
thousand
people
without
job
all
of
a
sudden
tesla
have
the
chance
to
buy
a
million
square
foot
plant
in
its
backyard
just
one
month
after
the

in

tesla

in
the

tesla

basically
secure
a

the

the
string

even
if
he

musk
the

tesla

as
it
would

this

get

would
generally
be
positive

constructive
javidan
say
we
would
try

get
him
ride
whenever
we
could

he
might
ask
for
the

of

two

more
money
to

javidan

we
put
together
a
plan
state
how
long
thing
would
take
and
what
they
would
cost
we
told
him
that
if
he
want
the
car
in
thirty
day
it
would
require
hire
some
new
people

we
present
him
with
a
stack
of
resume
you
don

tell
elon
you
can
t
do
something
that
will
get
you
kick
out

you
need
everything
line
up
after
we
present
the

he
say
okay
thanks
everyone
be
like
holy
shit
he
didn
t
fire
you
there
be
time
when
musk
would
overwhelm
the
tesla
engineer
with
his
request
he
take
a
model
s
prototype
home
for
a
weekend
and
come
back
on
the
monday
ask
for
around
eighty
change
since
musk
never
writes
anything
down
he
held
all
the
alteration
in
his
head
and
would
run
down
the
checklist
week
by
week
to
see
what
the
engineer
have
fix
the
same
engineering
rule
as
those
at
spacex
apply
you
do
what
musk
ask
or
be
prepared
to
burrow
down
into
the
property
of
material
to
explain
why
something
could
not
be

he
always

it
down

agonize
over
the

love

a
mess
musk
say
we
have
to
make
sure
they
be
not
too
hodgy
podgy
the
idea
of
musk
as
a
design
expert
have
long
struck
me
as
bizarre
he
s
a
physicist
at
heart
and
an
engineer
by
demeanor
so
much
of
who
musk
be
say
that
he
should
fall
into
that
silicon
valley
stereotype
of
the
schlubby
nerd
who
would
only
know
good
design
if
he
read
about
it
in
a
textbook
the
truth
be
that
there
might
be
some
of
that
go
on
with
musk
and
he
s
turn
it
into
an
advantage
he
s
very
visual
and
can
store
thing
that
others
have
deem
to
look
good
away
in
his
brain
for
recall
at
any
time
this
process
have
help
musk
develop
a
good
eye
which
he
s
combine
with
his
own
sensibility
while
also
refining
his
ability
to
put
what
he
want
into
word
the
result
be
a
confident
assertive
perspective
that
do
resonate
with
the
taste
of
consumer
like
steve
job
before
him
musk
be
able
to
think
up
thing
that
consumer
do
not
even
know
they
want
the
door
handle
the
giant
touch
screen
and
to
envision
a
share
point
of
view
for
all
of
tesla
s
product
and
service
elon
hold
tesla
up
as
a
product
company
von
holzhausen
say
he
s
passionate
that
you
have
to
get
the
product
right
i
have
to
deliver
for
him
and
make
sure
it
s
beautiful
and
attractive
with
the
model
x
musk
again
turn
to
his
role
as
a
dad
to
shape
some
of
the
flashiest
design
element
of
the
vehicle
he
and
von
holzhausen
be
walk
around
the
floor
of
an
auto
show
in
los
angeles
and
they
both
complain
about
the
awkwardness
of
get
to
the
middle
and
back
row
seat
in
an
suv
parent
who
have
felt
their
back
wrench
while
try
to
angle
a
child
and
car
seat
into
a
vehicle
know
this
reality
all
too
well
as
do
any
decent
size
human
who
have
try
to
wedge
into
a
third
row
seat
even
on
a
minivan
which
be
suppose
to
have
more
room
almost
one
third
of
the
entry
space
be
cover
by
the
slide
door
von
holzhausen
say
if
you
could
open
up
the
car
in
a
way
that
be
unique
and
special
that
could
be
a
real
game
changer
we
take
that
kernel
of
an
idea
back
and
work
up
forty
or
fifty
design
concept
to
solve
the
problem
and
i
think
we
end
up
with
one
of
the
most
radical
one
the
model
x
have
what
musk
coin
as
falcon
wing
door
they
re
hinge
version
of
the
gull
wing
door
found
on
some
high
end
car
like
the
delorean
the
door
go
up
and
then
flop
over
in
a
constrain
enough
way
that
the
model
x
won
t
rub
up
against
a
car
park
close
to
it
or
hit
the
ceiling
in
a
garage
the
end
result
be
that
a
parent
can
plop
a
child
in
the
second
row
passenger
seat
without
need
to
bend
over
or
twist
at
all
when
tesla
s
engineer
first
heard
about
the
falcon
wing
door
they
cringed
here
be
musk
with
another
crazy
ask
everyone
try
to
come
up
with
an
excuse
as
to
why
we
couldn
t
do
it
javidan
say
you
can
t
put
it
in
the
garage
it
won
t
work
with
thing
like
ski
then
elon
take
a
demo
model
to
his
house
and
show
us
that
the
door
open
everyone
be
mumble
yeah
in
a
fifteen
million
dollar
house
the
door
will
open
just
fine
like
the
controversial
door
handle
on
the
model
s
the
model
x
s
door
have
become
one
of
its
most
strike
feature
and
the
thing
consumer
talk
about
the
most
i
be
one
of
the
first
people
to
test
it
out
with
a
kid
s
car
seat
javidan
say
we
have
a
minivan
and
you
have
to
be
a
contortionist
to
get
the
seat
into
the
middle
row
compare
to
that
the
model
x
be
so
easy
if
it
s
a
gimmick
it
s
a
gimmick
that
work
during
my
visit
to
the
design
studio
tesla
have
a
number
of
competitor
vehicle
in
the
parking
lot
nearby
and
musk
make
sure
to
demonstrate
the
limitation
of
their
seat
compare
to
the
model
x
he
try
with
honest
effort
to
sit
in
the
third
row
of
an
acura
suv
but
even
though
the
car
claimed
to
have
room
for
seven
musk
s
knee
be
press
up
to
his
chin
and
he
never
really
fit
into
the
seat
that
s
like
a
midget
cave
he
say
anyone
can
make
a
car
big
on
the
outside
the
trick
be
to
make
it
big
on
the
inside
musk
go
from
one
rival
s
car
to
the
next
illuminate
the
vehicle
flaw
for
me
and
von
holzhausen
it
s
good
to
get
a
sense
for
just
how
bad
the
other
car
be
he
say
when
these
statement
fly
out
of
musk
s
mouth
it
s
momentarily
shock
here
s
a
guy
who
need
nine
year
to
produce
about
three
thousand
car
ridicule
automaker
that
build
million
of
vehicle
every
year
in
that
context
his
rib
come
off
as
absurd
musk
though
approach
everything
from
a
platonic
perspective
as
he
see
it
all
of
the
design
and
technology
choice
should
be
direct
toward
the
goal
of
make
a
car
as
close
to
perfect
as
possible
to
the
extent
that
rival
automaker
haven
t
that
s
what
musk
be
judging
it
s
almost
a
binary
experience
for
him
either
you
re
try
to
make
something
spectacular
with
no
compromise
or
you
re
not
and
if
you
re
not
musk
considers
you
a
failure
this
position
can
look
unreasonable
or
foolish
to
outsider
but
the
philosophy
work
for
musk
and
constantly
push
him
and
those
around
him
to
their
limit
on
june
tesla
invite
all
of
its
employee
some
select
customer
and
the
press
to
its
factory
in
fremont
to
watch
as
the

on
which
of
the

you

the

anywhere
from
eighteen
month
to
two
plus
year
late
some
of
the
delay
be
a
result
of
musk
s
request
for
exotic
technology
that
need
to
be
invent
other
delay
be
simply
a
function
of
this
still
quite
young
automaker
learn
how
to
produce
an
immaculate
luxury
vehicle
and
need
to
go
through
the
trial
and
error
tie
to
become
a
more
mature
more
refine
company
the

be
blown
away
by
their
first
glimpse
of
the
tesla
factory
musk
have
t
e
s
l
a
paint
in
enormous
black
letter
on
the
side
of
the
building
so
that
people
drive
by
on
the
freeway
or
fly
above
for
that
matter
be
make
well
aware
of
the
company
s
presence
the
inside
of
the
factory
once
dress
in
the
dark
dingy
tone
of
general
motor
and
toyota
have
take
on
the
musk
aesthetic
the
floor
receive
a
white
epoxy
the
wall
and
beam
be
paint
white
the
thirty
foot
tall

machine
be
white
and
then
much
of
the
other
machinery
like
the
team
of
the
robot
have
be
paint
red
make
the
place
look
like
an
industrial
version
of
santa
claus
s
workshop
just
as
he
do
at
spacex
musk
place
the
desk
of
his
engineer
right
on
the
factory
floor
where
they
work
in
an
area
cordoned
off
by
rudimentary
cubicle
divider
musk
have
a
desk
in
this
area
as
well
the
model
s
launch
event
take
place
in
a
section
of
the
factory
where
they
finish
off
the
car
there
s
a
part
of
the
floor
with
various
groove
and
bump
that
the
car
pas
over
as
technician
listen
for
any
rattle
there
s
also
a
chamber
where
water
can
be
sprayed
at
high
pressure
onto
the
car
to
check
for
leak
for
the
very
last
inspection
the

s
cruise
onto
a
raise
platform
make
out
of
bamboo
which
when
couple
with
lot
of
lead
light
be
meant
to
provide
an
abundant
amount
of
contrast
so
that
people
can
spot
flaw
on
the
body
for
the
few
first
month
that
the

come
off
the

musk
go
to
this
bamboo
stage
to
inspect
every
vehicle
he
be
down
on
all
four
look
up
under
the
wheel
well
say
steve
jurvetson
the
investor
and
tesla
board
member
hundred
of
people
have
gather
around
this

watch
as
the

so

present
to
their

many
of

lose
their

when
the
nummi

cry
as
the
model

be
line
up
on
the
stage
even
musk
s
most
cynical
critic
would
have
soften
for
a
moment
while
watch
the
proceeding
say
what
you
will
about
tesla
receive
government
money
or
hype
up
the
promise
of
the
electric
car
it

try
to
do
something
big
and
different
and
people
be
get

by
the
thousand
as
a
result
with
machine
hum
in
the
background
musk
give
a
brief
speech
and
then
hand
the
owner
their
key
they
drove
off
the
bamboo
platform
and
out
the
factory
door
while
the
tesla
employee
provide
a
stand
ovation
just
four
week
earlier
spacex
have
flown

and
have
its

first
all
around
for
a
private
company
that
feat
couple
with
the
launch
of
the
model
s
lead
to
a
rapid
transformation
in
the
way
the
world
outside
of
silicon
valley
perceive
musk
the
guy
who
be
always
promising
promising
promising
be
do
and
do
spectacular
thing
i
may
have
be
optimistic
with
respect
to
the
timing
on
some
of
these
thing
but
i
didn
t
over
promise
on
the
outcome
musk
told
me
during
an
interview
after
the
model
s
launch
i
have
do
everything
i
say
i
be
go
to
do
musk
do
not
have
riley
around
to
celebrate
with
and
share
in
this
run
of
good
fortune
they
have
divorce
and
musk
have
begin
to
think
about
date
again
if
he
could
find
the
time
even
with
this
turmoil
in
his
personal
life
however
musk
have
reach
a
point
of
calm
that
he
have
not
felt
in
many
year
my
main
emotion
be
that
there
be
a
bit
of
weight
off
my
shoulder
he
say
at
the
time
musk
take
his
boy
to
maui
to
meet
up
with
kimbal
and
other
relative
mark
his
first
real
vacation
in
a
number
of
year
it
be
right
after
this
holiday
that
musk
let
me
have
the
first
substantial
glimpse
into
his
life
skin
still
peel
off
his
sunburnt
arm
musk
met
with
me
at
the
tesla
and
spacex
headquarters
at
the
tesla
design
studio
and
at
a
beverley

visit

me
that
during
a
barbecue
musk

taught
the
kid
how
to
fire
off
model
rocket
and
then
later

a
village
deeper
in
the
jungle
by
travel
in
a
dugout
canoe
after
the
screen
musk
and
i
hung
out
on
the
street
for
a
bit
away
from
the
crowd
i
note
aloud
that
everyone
want
to
make
him
out
as
the
tony
stark
character
but
that
he
didn
t
really
exude
that
playboy
drinking
scotch
while
zoom
through
afghanistan
in
an
army

some
drink

and
then
invite
me
to
grab
some
drink
across
the
street
at
mr
chow
to
celebrate
the
movie
all
seem
to
be
go
well
for

and
he

the
moment
this
restful
period
do
not

and
soon

tesla
s
battle
for
survival

the
company

produce
about
ten

per
week
at
the

investor
who
bet

short
stock

of
one
hundred
of
the
large
company

on
the
nasdaq

the
naysayer
expect
numerous
model
s
flaw
to
crop
up
and
undermine
the
enthusiasm
for
the
car
to
the
point
that
people
start
cancel
their
order
in
bulk
there
be
also
huge
doubt
that
tesla
could
ramp
up
production
in
a
meaningful
way
and
do
so
profitably
in
october
the
presidential
hopeful
mitt
romney
dubbed
tesla
a
loser
while
slag
off
a
couple
of
other

back
green

company
the
solar
panel
maker

during
a
debate
with

obama
while
the
doubter
place
huge
wager
on
tesla
s
impend
failure
musk
s
bluster
mode
engage
he
begin
talk
about
tesla
s
goal
to
become
the
most
profitable
major
automobile
maker
in
the
world
with
well
margin
than
bmw
then
in
september
he
unveiled
something
that
shock
both
tesla
critic
and
proponent
alike
tesla
have
secretly
be
building
the
first
leg
of
a
network
of
charge
station
the
company
disclose
the
location
of
six
station
in
california
nevada
and
arizona
and
promise
that
hundred
more
would
be
on
the
way
tesla
intend
to
build
a
global
charge
network
that
would
let
model
s
owner
make
long
drive
pull
off
the
highway
and
recharge
very
quickly
and
they
would
be
able
to
do
so
for
free
in
fact
musk
insist
that
tesla
owner
would
soon
be
able
to
travel
across
the
united
state
without
spending
a
penny
on
fuel
model
s
driver
would
have
no
trouble
find
these
station
not
only
because
the
car
onboard
computer
would
guide
them
to
the
near
one
but
because
musk
and
von
holzhausen
have
design
giant
red
and
white
monolith
to
herald
the
appearance
of
the
station
the
supercharge
station
as
tesla
call
them
represent
a
huge
investment
for
the
strap
company
an
argument
could
easily
be
make
that
spending
money
on
this
sort
of
thing
at
such
a
precarious
moment
in
the
model
s
and
tesla
s
history
be
somewhere
between
daft
and
batshit
crazy
surely
musk
do
not
have
the
gall
to
try
to
revamp
the
very
idea
of
the
automobile
and
build
an
energy
network
at
the
same
time
with
a
budget
equivalent
to
what
ford
and
exxonmobil
spend
on
their
annual
holiday
party
but
that
be
the
exact
plan
musk
straubel
and
others
inside
tesla
have
mapped
out
this
all
or
nothing
play
long
ago
and
built
certain
feature
into
the
model
s
with
the
supercharger
in
mind
while
the
arrival
of
the
model
s
and
the
charge
network
garner
tesla
a
ton
of
headline
it
remain
unclear
if
the
positive
press
and
good
vibe
would
last
serious
trade
offs
have
be
make
as
tesla
rush
to
get
the
model
s
to
market
the
car
have
some
spectacular
novel
feature
but
everyone
inside
of
the
company
knew
that
as
far
as
luxury
sedan
go
the
model
s
do
not
match
up
feature
to
feature
with
car
from
bmw
and
mercedes
benz
the
first
few
thousand
model
s
car
for
example
would
ship
without
the
parking
sensor
and
radar
assist
cruise
control
common
on
other
high
end
car
it
be
either
hire
a
team
of
fifty
people
right
away
to
make
one
of
these
thing
happen
or
implement
thing
as
best
and
as
fast
as
you
could
javidan
say
the
subpar
fit
and
finish
also
prove
hard
to
explain
the
early
adopter
could
tolerate
a
windshield
wiper
go
haywire
for
a
couple
of
day
but
they
want
to
see
seat
and
visor
that
met
the
price
tag
while
tesla
do
its
best
to
source
the
high
quality
material
it
struggle
at
time
to
convince
the
top
supplier
to
take
the
company
seriously
people
be
very
suspect
that
we
would
deliver
one
thousand
model
s
say
von
holzhausen
it
be
frustrate
because
we
have
the
drive
internally
to
make
the
car
perfect
but
could
not
get
the
same
commitment
externally
with
something
like
the
visor
we
end
up
have
to
go
to
a
third
rate
supplier
and
then
work
on
fix
the
situation
after
the
car
have
already
start
shipping
the
cosmetic
issue
though
be
minor
compare
to
a
tumultuous
set
of
internal
circumstance
reveal
in
detail
here
for
the
first
time
that
threaten
to
bankrupt
the
company
once
again
musk
have
hire
george
blankenship
a
former
apple
executive
to
run
its
store
and
service
center
operation
at
apple
blankenship
work
just
a
couple
of
door
down
from
steve
job
and
receive
credit
for
building
much
of
the
apple
store
strategy
when
tesla
first
hire
blankenship
the
press
and
public
be
atwitter
anticipate
that
d
he
do
something
spectacular
and
at
odds
with
the
tradition
of
the
automotive
industry
blankenship
do
some
of
that
he
expand
tesla
s
number
of
store
throughout
the
world
and
imbue
them
with
that
apple
store
vibe
along
with
showcasing
the
model
s
the
tesla
store
sell
hoodies
and
hat
and
have
area
in
the
back
where
kid
would
find
crayon
and
tesla
color
book
blankenship
give
me
a
tour
of
the
tesla
store
on
santana
row
the
glitzy
shopping
center
in
san
jose
he
come
off
as
a
warm
grandfatherly
sort
who
saw
tesla
as
his
chance
to
make
a
difference
the
typical
dealer
want
to
sell
you
a
car
on
the
spot
to
clear
inventory
off
his
lot
blankenship
say
the
goal
here
be
to
develop
a
relationship
with
tesla
and
electric
vehicle
tesla
he
say
want
to
turn
the
model
s
into
more
than
a
car
ideally
it
would
be
an
object
of
desire
just
like
the
ipod
and
iphone
blankenship
note
that
tesla
have
more
than
ten
thousand
reservation
for
the
model
s
at
the
time
the
vast
majority
of
which
have
arrive
without
the
customer
test
drive
the
car
a
lot
of
this
early
interest
result
from
the
aura
surround
musk
who
blankenship
say
come
off
as
similar
to
job
but
with
a
tone
down
control
freak
vibe
this
be
the
first
place
i
have
work
that
be
go
to
change
the
world
blankenship
say
take
a
jab
at
the
sometimes
trivial
nature
of
apple
s
gadget
while
musk
and
blankenship
get
along
at
first
their
relationship
fell
apart
during
the
latter
stage
of
tesla
do
have
a
large
number
of
reservation
in
which
people
put
down
for
the
right
to
buy
a
model
s
and
get
in
the
purchase
queue
but
the
company
have
struggle
to
turn
these
reservation
into
actual
sale
the
reason
behind
this
problem
remain
unclear
it
may
have
be
that
the
complaint
about
the
interior
and
the
early
kink
mention
on
the
tesla
forum
and
message
board
be
cause
concern
tesla
also
lack
financing
option
to
soften
the
blow
of
buying
a
car
while
uncertainty
surround
the
resale
market
for
the
model
s
you
might
end
up
with
the
car
of
the
future
or
you
might
spend
six
figure
on
a
dud
with
a
battery
pack
that
loses
its
capacity
and
with
no
secondary
buyer
tesla
s
service
center
at
the
time
be
also
terrible
the
early
car
be
unreliable
and
customer
be
be
sent
in
drove
to
center
unprepared
to
handle
the
volume
many
prospective
tesla
owner
likely
want
to
hang
out
on
the
sideline
for
a
bit
longer
to
make
sure
that
the
company
would
remain
viable
as
musk
put
it
the
word
of
mouth
on
the
car
suck
by
the
middle
of
february
tesla
have
fall
into
a
crisis
state
if
it
could
not
convert
its
reservation
to
purchase
quickly
its
factory
would
sit
idle
cost
the
company
vast
amount
of
money
and
if
anyone
caught
wind
of
the
factory
slowdown
tesla
s
share
would
likely
plummet
prospective
owner
would
become
even
more
cautious
and
the
short
seller
would
win
the
severity
of
this
problem
have
be
hidden
from
musk
but
once
he
learn
about
it
he
act
in
his
signature
all
or
nothing
fashion
musk
pull
people
from
recruiting
the
design
studio
engineering
finance
and
wherever
else
he
could
find
them
and
order
them
to
get
on
the
phone
call
people
with
reservation
and
close
deal
if
we
don
t
deliver
these
car
we
be
fuck
musk
told
the
employee
so
i
don
t
care
what
job
you
be
do
your
new
job
be

he
place
jerome
guillen
a
former
daimler
executive
in
charge
of
fix
the
service
issue
musk
fire
senior
leader
whom
he
deem
subpar
performer
and
promote
a
flood
of
junior
people
who
have
be

above

he
also
make
an
announcement
personally

the
resale

be
able
to
resell
their
car
for
the
average
go
rate
of
similar
luxury
sedan
with
musk
put
his
billion
behind
this
pledge
and
then
musk
try
to
orchestrate
the
ultimate
fail
safe
for
tesla
just
in
case
his
maneuver
do
not
work
during
the
first
week
of
april
musk
reach
out
to
his
friend
larry
page
at
google
accord
to
people
familiar
with
their
discussion
musk
voiced
his
concern
about
tesla
s
ability
to
survive
the
next
few
week
not
only
be
customer
fail
to
convert
their
reservation
to
order
at
the
rate
musk
hop
but
exist
customer
have
also
start
to
defer
their
order
as
they
heard
about
upcoming
feature
and
new
color
choice
the
situation
get
so
bad
that
tesla
have
to
shut
down
its
factory
publicly
tesla
say
it
need
to
conduct
maintenance
on
the
factory
which
be
technically
true
although
the
company
would
have
soldier
on
have
the
order
be
closing
as
expect
musk
explain
all
of
this
to
page
and
then
struck
a
handshake
deal
for
google
to
acquire
tesla
while
musk
do
not
want
to
sell
the
deal
seem
like
the
only
viable
course
for
tesla
s
future
musk
s
big
fear
about
an
acquisition
be
that
the
new
owner
would
not
see
tesla
s
goal
through
to
their
conclusion
he
want
to
make
sure
that
the
company
would
end
up
produce
a
mass
market
electric
vehicle
musk
propose
term
under
which
he
would
remain
in
control
of
tesla
for
eight
year
or
until
it
start
pump
out
a
mass
market
car
musk
also
ask
for
access
to
billion
in
capital
for
factory
expansion
some
of
google
s
lawyer
be
put
off
by
these
demand
but
musk
and
page
continued
to
talk
about
the
deal
give
tesla
s
value
at
the
time
it
be
thought
that
google
would
need
to
pay
about
billion
for
the
company
as
musk
page
and
google
s
lawyer
debate
the
parameter
of
an

a
miracle
happen
the
five
hundred
or
so
people
whom
musk
have
turn
into

quickly
sell
a
huge
volume
of

that

when
he
brought
a

up
onstage

the

in
a
matter
of
second
the
company
just
hadn
t
told
anyone
about
this
tesla
would
now
start
add
battery
swap
at
its
charge
station
as
a
quicker
option
to
recharge
someone
could
drive
right
over
a
pit
where
a

would
take
off

battery
pack
and
install
a

at
a
cost
equivalent
to
fill

the
only
decision
that
you
have

like
it

the

at
the
time
and
that
s
always
what
he
deal
with
and
how
he
prioritizes
it
could
kill
the

represent
an
existential

moment
where
his
unconventional
style
in
these
type
of
situation
have
make
me
cringe
yes
but
i
trust
that
it
will
work
out
in
the
end
musk
apply
a
similar
approach
to

with
the
fire
by
declare
the

the
safest

in

none
of
this
have
any
effect

musk
s
star
shone
brighter
and
brighter
as
tesla

market
value
balloon
to
about
half
that
of
gm
and
ford
tesla
held
another
press
event
in
october
that
cement
musk
s
place
as
the
new
titan
of
the
auto
industry
musk
unveiled
a
supercharge
version
of
the
model
s
with
two
motor
one
in
the
front
and
one
in
the
back
it
could
go
zero
to
in
second
the
company
have
turn
a
sedan
into
a
supercar
it
s
like
take
off
from
a
carrier
deck
musk
say
it
s
just
banana
musk
also
unveiled
a
new
suite
of
software
for
the
model
s
that
give
it
autopilot
function
the
car
have
radar
to
detect
object
and
warn
of
possible
collision
and
could
guide
itself
via
gps
later
you
will
be
able
to
summon
the
car
musk
say
it
will
come
to
wherever
you
be
there
s
also
something
else
i
would
like
to
do
many
of
our
engineer
will
be
hearing
this
in
real
time
i
would
like
the
charge
connector
to
plug
itself
into
the
car
sort
of
like
an
articulate
snake
i
think
we
will
probably
do
something
like
that
thousand
of
people
wait
in
line
for
hour
to
see
musk
demonstrate
this
technology
musk
crack
joke
during
the
presentation
and
played
off
the
crowd
s
enthusiasm
the
man
who
have
be
awkward
in
front
of
medium
during
the
paypal
year
have
developed
a
unique
slick
stagecraft
a
woman
stand
next
to
me
in
the
crowd
go
weak
in
the
knee
when
musk
first
take
the
stage
a
man
to
my
other
side
say
he
want
a
model
x
and
have
just
offer
to
a
friend
to
move
up
on
the
reservation
list
so
that
he
could
end
up
with
model
no
the
enthusiasm
couple
with
musk
s
ability
to
generate
attention
be
emblematic
of
just
how
far
the
little
automaker
and
its
eccentric
ceo
have
come
rival
car
company
would
kill
to
receive
such
interest
and
have
basically
be
left
dumbfound
as
tesla
snuck
up
on
them
and
deliver
more
than
they
have
ever
imagine
possible

of

dozen
of
compute
system
make
by
different
company
that
all
have
to
speak
to
each
other
and
work
as
one
it
be
a
mess
of
complexity
that
have
evolve
over
time
and
simplify
the
situation
would
prove
near
impossible
at
this
point
especially
for
a
company
like
ford
which
need
to
pump
out
hundred
of
thousand
of
car
per
year
and
could
not
afford
to
stop
and
reboot
tesla
by
contrast
get
to
start
from
scratch
and
make
its
own
software
the
focus
of
the
model
s
giuli
would
have
love
the
same
opportunity
software
be
in
many
way
the
heart
of
the
new
vehicle
experience
he
say
from
the
powertrain
to
the
warn
chime
in
the
car
you
re
use
software
to
create
an
expressive
and
please
environment
the
level
of
integration
that
the
software
have
into
the
rest
of
the
model
s
be
really
impressive
tesla
be
a
benchmark
for
what
we
do
here
not
long
after
this
chat
giuli
left
ford
to
become
an
engineer
at
a
stealth
start
up
there
be
little
the
mainstream
auto
industry
could
do
to
slow
tesla
down
but
that
didn
t
stop
executive
from
try
to
be
difficult
whenever
possible
tesla
for
example
want
to
call
its
third
generation
car
the
model
e
so
that
its
lineup
of
vehicle
would
be
the
model
s
e
and
x
another
playful
musk
gag
but
ford
s
then
ceo
alan
mulally
block
tesla
from
use
model
e
with
the
threat
of
a
lawsuit
so
i
call
up
mulally
and
i
be
like
alan
be
you
just
fuck
with
us
or
be
you
really
go
to
do
a
model
e
musk
say
and
i
m
not
sure
which
be
bad
you
know
like
it
would
actually
make
more
sense
if
they
re
just
fuck
with
us
because
if
they
actually
come
out
with
a
model
e
at
this
point
and
we
ve
get
the
model
s
and
the
x
and
ford
come
out
with
the
model
e
it
s
go
to
look
ridiculous
so
even
though
ford
do
the
model
t
a
hundred
year
ago
nobody
think
of
model
as
be
a
ford
thing
anymore
so
it
would
just
feel
like
they
stole
it
like
why
do
you
go
steal
tesla
s
e
like
you
re
some
sort
of
fascist
army
march
across
the
alphabet
some
sort
of
sesame
street
robber
and
he
be
like
no
no
we
re
definitely
go
to
use
it
and
i
be
like
oh
i
don
t
think
that
s
such
a
good
idea
because
people
be
go
to
be
confuse
because
it
s
not
go
to
make
sense
people
aren
t
use
to
ford
have
model
something
these
day
it
s
usually
call
like
the
ford
fusion
and
he
be
like
no
his
guy
really
want
to
use
that
that
s
terrible
after
that
tesla
register
the
trademark
for
model
y
as
another
joke
in
fact
ford
call
us
up
deadpan
and
say
we
see
you
ve
register
model
y
be
that
what
you
re
go
to
use
instead
of
the
model
e
musk
say
i
m
like
no
it
s
a
joke
s
e
x
y
what
do
that
spell
but
trademark
law
be
a
dry
profession
it
turn
out
what
musk
have
do
that
the
rival
automaker
miss
or
didn
t
have
the
mean
to
combat
be
turn
tesla
into
a
lifestyle
it
do
not
just
sell
someone
a

take

you
can
see

embrace
of
the

it
can
at
the
time

that
s
what
the
customer
receives
this

that
tesla
do
not
develop
and
hold
on
to
a
bunch
of
new
feature
over
the
course
of
the
year
and
then
unleash
them
in
a

at

most
of
the
upgrade
as

for

in
at
night
a
rhythm
familiar
to
anyone
with
a
smartphone
the
car
will
start
charge
right
away
or
the
owner
can
tap
into
the
model
s
s
software
and
schedule

to
take
place
late
at
night
when
the
cheapest
electricity
rate
be
available
tesla
owner
not
only
dodge
gas
station
they
mostly
get
to
skip
out
on
visit
to
mechanic
a
traditional
vehicle
need
oil
and
transmission
fluid
change
to
deal
with
all
the
friction
and
wear
and
tear
produce
by
its
thousand
of
move
part
the
simpler
electric
car
design
eliminates
this
type
of
maintenance
both
the
roadster
and
the
model
s
also
take
advantage
of
what
s
know
as
regenerative
brake
which
extends
the
life
of
the
brake
during
stop
and
go
situation
the
tesla
will
brake
by
kick
the
motor
into
reverse
via
software
and
slow
down
the
wheel
instead
of
use
brake
pad
and
friction
to
clamp
them
down
the
tesla
motor
generates
electricity
during
this
process
and
funnel
it
back
to
the
battery
which
be
why
electric
car
get
well
mileage
in
city
traffic
tesla
still
recommends
that
owner
bring
in
the
model
s
once
a
year
for
a
checkup
but
that
s
mostly
to
give
the
vehicle
a
once
over
and
make
sure
that
none
of
the
component
seem
to
be
wear
down
prematurely
even
tesla
s
approach
to
maintenance
be
philosophically
different
from
that
of
the
traditional
automotive
industry
most
car
dealer
make
the
majority
of
their
profit
from
service
car
they
treat
vehicle
like
a
subscription
service
expect
people
to
visit
their
service
center
multiple
time
a
year
for
many
year
this
be
the
main
reason
dealership
have
fought
to
block
tesla
from
sell
its
car
directly
to
consumer
the
ultimate
goal
be
to
never
have
to
bring
your
car
back
in
after
you
buy
it
say
javidan
the
dealer
charge
more
than
independent
mechanic
but
give
people
the
peace
of
mind
that
their
car
be
be
work
on
by
a
specialist
for
a
particular
make
of
vehicle
tesla
make
its
profit
off
the
initial
sale
of
the
car
and
then
from
some
optional
software
service
i
get
the
number
ten
model
s
say
konstantin
othmer
the
silicon
valley
software
whiz
and
entrepreneur
it
be
an
awesome
car
but
it
have
just
about
every
issue
you
might
have
read
about
in
the
forum
they
would
fix
all
these
thing
and
decide
to
trailer
the
car
back
to
the
shop
so
that
they
didn
t
add
any
mile
to
it
then
i
go
in
for
a
one
year
service
and
they
spruce
up
everything
so
that
the
car
be
well
than
new
it
be
surround
by
velvet
rope
in
the
service
center
it
be
just
beautiful
tesla
s
model
isn
t
just
about
be
an
affront
to
the
way
carmaker
and
dealer
do
business
it
s
a
more
subtle
play
on
how
electric
car
represent
a
new
way
to
think
of
automobile
all
car
company
will
soon
follow
tesla
s
lead
and
offer
some
form
of
over
the
air
update
to
their
vehicle
the
practicality
and
scope
of
their
update
will
be
limited
however
you
just
can
t
do
an
over
the
air
sparkplug
change
or
replacement
of
the
timing
belt
say
javidan
with
a
gas
car
you
have
to
get
under
the
hood
at
some
point
and
that
force
you
back
to
the
dealership
anyway
there
s
no
real
incentive
for
mercedes
to
say
you
don
t
need
to
bring
the
car
in
because
it
s
not
true
tesla
also
have
the
edge
of
have
design
so
many
of
the
key
component
for
its
car
in
house
include
the
software
run
throughout
the
vehicle
if
daimler
want
to
change
the
way
a
gauge
look
it
have
to
contact
a
supplier
half
a
world
away
and
then
wait
for
a
series
of
approval
javidan
say
it
would
take
them
a
year
to
change
the
way
the
p
on
the
instrument
panel
look
at
tesla
if
elon
decides
he
want
a
picture
of
a
bunny
rabbit
on
every
gauge
for
easter
he
can
have
that
do
in
a
couple
of
hour
as
tesla
turn
into
a
star
of
modern
american
industry
its
closest
rival
be
obliterate
fisker
automotive
file
for
bankruptcy
and
be
bought
by
a
chinese
auto
part
company
in
one
of
its
main
investor
be
ray
lane
a

caufield
byers

have
cost
kleiner
perkins
a
chance

then
back
fisker
a
disastrous
move
that
tarnished
the
firm

brand
and
lane
s
reputation
well
place
be
another
start
up
that
enjoy
more
hype
than
fisker

tesla
put
together
and
raise
close
to
billion
to
build
electric
car
and
battery
swap
station
the
company
never
produce
much
of
anything
and
declare
bankruptcy
in
the
guy
like
straubel
who
have
be
at
tesla
since
the
begin
be
quick
to
remind
people
that
the
chance
to
build
an
awesome
electric
car
have
be
there
all
along
it
s
not
really
like
there
be
a
rush
to
this
idea
and
we
get
there
first
straubel
say
it
be
frequently
forgotten
in
hindsight
that
people
thought
this
be
the
shittiest
business
opportunity
on
the
planet
the
venture
capitalist
be
all
run
for
the
hill
what
separate
tesla
from
the
competition
be
the
willingness
to
charge
after
its
vision
without
compromise
a
complete
commitment
to
execute
to
musk
s
standard

the
unified
field
theory
of
elon
musk
the

use
to
be
like
a

gang
in
the
late

jump

and
zip
around
the

ask

young
men
who
have
all
grown
up
in
south

with
their

elon
musk
soon
decide
there
must
be
an
easy
way
to
hawk
their
technology
smart
than
go
door
to
door
they
write
some

allow
them
to
take
control
of
their

to

of

lyndon
rent
an

out
with

have
study
it
a

there
be

musk
a

off
a

elevate

shift
it
to
the

so
that
it

replace
the

musk
take
a

in

the
funky

elon

there

his
longtime

it
s
his
version
of

he
want
to
go

the

musk
put
on
a
display
of
strength
and
determination
at
the

as
well
there
be
a
wooden

perhaps
thirty
foot
high
with
a
dance
platform
at
the
top
dozen
of
people
try
and
fail
to
climb
it
and
then
musk
give
it
a
go
his
technique
be
very
awkward
and
he
should
not
have
succeed
say
lyndon
but
he
hug
it
and
just
inched
up
and
inched
up
until
he
reach
the
top
musk
and
the
rives
left
burning
man
enthuse
the
rives
decide
to
become
expert
on
the
solar
industry
and
find
the
opportunity
in
the
market
they
spent
two
year
study
solar
technology
and
the
dynamic
of
the
business
reading
research
report
interview
people
and
attend
conference
along
the
way
it
be
during
the
solar
power
international
conference
that
the
rive
brother
really
hit
on
what
their
business
model
might
be
only
about
two
thousand
people
show
up
for
the
event
and
they
all
fit
into
a
couple
of
hotel
conference
room
for
presentation
and
panel
during
one
open

session
representative
from
a
handful
of
the
world
s
large
solar
installers
be
sit
onstage
and
the
moderator
ask
what
they
be
do
to
make
solar
panel
more
affordable
for
consumer
they
all
give
the
same
answer
lyndon
say
they
say
we
re
wait
for
the
cost
of
the
panel
to
drop
none
of
them
be
take
ownership
of
the
problem
at
the
time
it
be
not
easy
for
consumer
to
get
solar
panel
on
their
house
you
have
to
be
very
proactive
acquire
the
panel
and
find
someone
else
to
install
them
the
consumer
paid
up
front
and
have
to
make
an
educate
guess
as
to
whether
or
not
his
or
her
house
even
get
enough
sunshine
to
make
the
ordeal
worthwhile
on
top
of
all
this
people
be
reluctant
to
buy
panel
know
that
the
next
year
s
model
would
be
more
efficient
the
rives
decide
to
make
buying
into
the
solar
proposition
much
simpler
and
form
a
company
call
solarcity
in
unlike
other
company
they
would
not
manufacture
their
own
solar
panel
instead
they
would
buy
them
and
then
do
just
about
everything
else
in
house
they
built
software
for
analyze
a
customer
s
current
energy
bill
and
the
position
of
their
house
and
the
amount
of
sunlight
it
typically
receive
to
determine
if
solar
make
sense
for
the
property
they
built
up
their
own
team
to
install
the
solar
panel
and
they
create
a
financing
system
in
which
the
customer
do
not
need
to
pay
anything
up
front
for
the
panel
the
consumer
lease
the
panel
over
a
number
of
year
at
a
fix
monthly
rate
consumer
get
a
low
bill
overall
they
be
no
longer
subject
to
the
constantly
rise
rate
of
typical
utility
and
if
they
sell
their
house
they
could
pas
the
contract
to
the
new
owner
at
the
end
of
the
lease
the
homeowner
could
also
upgrade
to
new
more
efficient
panel
musk
have
help
his

up
with
this

that
conservative
love
to
hold
up
as
a
cautionary
tale
of
government
spending
and
cronyism
run
amok
some
of
the
most
famous
venture
capitalist
in
history
like
john
doerr
and
vinod
khosla
be
ripped
apart
by
the
local
and
national
press
for
their
fail
green
investment
the
story
be
almost
always
the
same
people
have
thrown
money
at
green
technology
because
it
seem
like
the
right
thing
to
do
not
because
it
make
business
sense
from
new
kind
of
energy
storage
system
to
electric
car
and
solar
panel
the
technology
never
quite
live
up
to
its
billing
and
require
too
much
government
funding
and
too
many
incentive
to
create
a
viable
market
much
of
this
criticism
be
fair
it
s
just
that
there
be
this
elon
musk
guy
hang
around
who
seem
to
have
figure
something
out
that
everyone
else
have
miss
we
have
a
blanket
rule
against
invest
in
clean
tech
company
for
about
a
decade
say
peter
thiel
the
paypal
cofounder
and
venture
capitalist
at
founder
fund
on
the
macro
level
we
be
right
because
clean
tech
as
a
sector
be
quite
bad
but
on
the
micro
level
it
look
like
elon
have
the
two
most
successful
clean
tech
company
in
the
u
s
we
would
rather
explain
his
success
as
be
a
fluke
there
s
the
whole
iron
man
thing
in
which
he
s
present
as
a
cartoonish
businessman
this
very
unusual
animal
at
the
zoo
but
there
be
now
a
degree
to
which
you
have
to
ask
whether
his
success
be
an
indictment
on
the
rest
of
us
who
have
be
work
on
much
more
incremental
thing
to
the
extent
that
the
world
still
doubt
elon
i
think
it
s
a
reflection
on
the
insanity
of
the
world
and
not
on
the
suppose
insanity
of
elon
solarcity
like
the
rest
of
musk
s
venture
do
not
represent
a
business
opportunity
so
much
as
it
represent
a
worldview
musk
have
decide
long
ago
in
his
very
rational
manner
that
solar
make
sense
enough
solar
energy
hit
the
earth
s
surface
in
about
an
hour
to
equal
a
year
s
worth
of
worldwide
energy
consumption
from
all
source
put
together
improvement
in
the
efficiency
of
solar
panel
have
be
happen
at
a
steady
clip
if
solar
be
destine
to
be
mankind
s
prefer
energy
source
in
the
future
then
this
future
ought
to
be
brought
about
as
quickly
as
possible
start
in
solarcity
begin
to
make
the
full
extent
of
its
ambition
more
obvious
first
the
company
begin
sell
energy
storage
system
these
unit
be
built
through
a
partnership
with
tesla
motor
battery
pack
be
manufacture
at
the
tesla
factory
and
stack
inside
refrigerator
size
metal
case
business
and
consumer
could
purchase
these
storage
system
to
augment
their
solar
panel
array
once
they
be
charge
up
the
battery
unit
could
be
use
to
help
large
customer
get
through
the
night
or
during
unexpected
outage
customer
could
also
pull
from
the
battery
instead
of
the
grid
during
peak
energy
use
period
when
utility
tend
to
tack
on
extra
charge
while
solarcity
roll
the
storage
unit
out
in
a
modest
experimental
fashion
the
company
expect
most
of
its
customer
to
buy
the
system
in
the
year
ahead
to
smooth
out
the
solar
experience
and
help
people
and
business
leave
the
electrical
grid
altogether
then
in
june
solarcity
acquire
a
solar
cell
maker
call
silevo
for
million
this
deal
marked
a
huge
shift
in
strategy
solarcity
would
no
longer
buy
its
solar
panel
it
would
make
them
at
a
factory
in
new
york
state
silevo
s
cell
be
say
to
be
percent
efficient
at
turn
light
into
energy
compare
to
percent
for
most
cell
and
the
expectation
be
that
the
company
could
reach
percent
efficiency
with
the
right
manufacturing
technique
buying
rather
than
manufacturing
solar
panel
have
be
one
of
solarcity
s
great
advantage
it
could
capitalize
on
the
glut
in
the
solar
cell
market
and
avoid
the
large
capital
expenditure
tie
to
building
and
run
factory
with
customer
however
solarcity
have
start
to
consume
so
many
solar
panel
that
it
need
to
ensure
a
consistent
supply
and
price
we
be
currently
instal
more
solar
than
most
of
the
company
be
manufacturing
say
peter
rive
the
cofounder
and
chief
technology
officer
at
solarcity
if
we
do
the
manufacturing
ourselves
and
take
advantage
of
some
different
technology
our
cost
will
be
low
and
this
business
have
always
be
about
lower
the
cost
after
add
the
lease
the
storage
unit
and
the
solar
cell
manufacturing
together
it
become
clear
to
close
observer
of
solarcity
that
the
company
have
morph
into
something
resemble
a
utility
it
have
built
out
a
network
of
solar
system
all
under
its
control
and
manage
by
the
company
s
software
by
the
end
of
solarcity
expect
to
have
instal
gigawatts
worth
of
solar
panel
produce
terawatt
hour
of
electricity
per
year
this
would
put
us
on
a
path
to
fulfill
our
goal
to
become
one
of
the
large
supplier
of
electricity
in
the
united
state
the
company
say
after
announce
these
figure
in
a
quarterly
earnings
statement
the
reality
be
that
solarcity
account
for
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
united
state
annual
energy
consumption
and
have
a
long
way
to
go
to
become
a
major
supplier
of
electricity
in
the
country
there
can
however
be
little
doubt
that
musk
intend
for
the
company
to
be
a
dominant
force
in
the
solar
industry
and
in
the
energy
industry
overall
what
s
more
solarcity
be
a
key
part
of
what
can
be
thought
of
as
the
unified
field
theory
of
musk
each
one
of
his
business
be
interconnect
in
the
short
term
and
the
long
term
tesla
make
battery
pack
that
solarcity
can
then
sell
to
end
customer
solarcity
supply

each

as

they
exchange

around
material

the
intricacy
of
operating
factory
that
build
so
much
stuff
from
the
ground
up
for
most
of
their
history
solarcity
tesla
and
spacex
have
be
the
clear
underdog
in
their
respective
market
and
go
to
war
against
deep
pocket
entrench

the
solar
automotive

remain
lard
down
by
regulation
and

which
favor
incumbent
to
people
in
these

musk
come
off
as
a
wide
eyed
technologist
who
could
be
easily
dismiss
and
ridicule
and
who
as
a
competitor
fell
somewhere
on
the
spectrum
between
annoy

full
of
shit
the

their

to
make

as
miserable
as

on
all
three
of

they
be
pretty
good
at
it

of
musk

turn
into
a

it
become
harder
to
go
at

musk

often
solarcity

they

musk

the

at

spent

also
his

fifteen
thousand

on
the

of
ever
more
ambitious
product
tesla
s
primary
focus
throughout
will
be
bring
the
model
x
to
market
musk
expect
the
suv
to
sell
at
least
as
well
as
the
model
s
and
want
tesla
s
factory
to
be
capable
of
make
car
per
year
by
the
end
of
to
keep
up
with
demand
for
both
vehicle
the
major
downside
accompany
the
model
x
be
its
price
the
suv
will
start
at
the
same
lofty
price
as
the
model
s
which
limit
the
potential
customer
base
the
hope
though
be
that
the
model
x
turn
into
the
luxury
vehicle
of
choice
for
family
and
solidifies
the
tesla
brand
s
connection
with
woman
musk
have
pledge
that
the
supercharger
network
service
center
and
the
battery
swap
station
will
be
built
out
even
more
in
to
greet
the
arrival
of
the
new
vehicle
beyond
the
model
x
tesla
have
start
work
on
the
second
version
of
the
roadster
talk
about
make
a
truck
and
in
all
seriousness
have
begin
model
a
type
of
submarine
car
that
could
transition
from
road
to
water
musk
paid
million
for
the
lotus
esprit
that
roger
moore
drove
underwater
in
the
spy
who
love
me
and
want
to
prove
that
such
a
vehicle
can
be
do
maybe
we
ll
make
two
or
three
but
it
wouldn
t
be
more
than
that
musk
told
the
independent
newspaper
i
think
the
market
for
submarine
car
be
quite
small
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
sale
spectrum
or
so
musk
hope
will
be
tesla
s
third
generation
car
or
the
model
due
out
in
this
four
door
car
would
come
in
around
and
be
the
real
measure
of
tesla
s
impact
on
the
world
the
company
hope
to
sell
hundred
of
thousand
of
the
model
and
make
electric
car
truly
mainstream
for
comparison
bmw
sell
about
mini
and
of
its
bmw
series
vehicle
per
year
tesla
would
look
to
match
those
figure
i
think
tesla
be
go
to
make
a
lot
of
car
musk
say
if
we
continue
on
the
current
growth
rate
i
think
tesla
will
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
company
in
the
world
tesla
already
consumes
a
huge
portion
of
the
world
s
lithium
ion
battery
supply
and
will
need
far
more
battery
to
produce
the
model
this
be
why
in
musk
announce
plan
to
build
what
he
dubbed
the
gigafactory
or
the
world
s
large
lithium
ion
manufacturing
facility
each
gigafactory
will
employ
about
people
and
help
tesla
meet
a
variety
of
goal
it
should
first
allow
tesla
to
keep
up
with
the
battery
demand
create
by
its
car
and
the
storage
unit
sell
by

to
be

to
low
the
cost
of

their

density
it
will
build
the

partner

it

accord

the

pack
come
out
of
the
gigafactory
should
be
dramatically
cheaper
and
well
than
the
one
built
today
allow
tesla
not
only
to
hit
the
price
target
for
the

but
also
to
pave
the
way
for
electric

with
plus
mile
of
range
if
tesla
actually
can
deliver
an
affordable
car
with
mile
of
range
it
will
have
built
what
many
people
in
the
auto
industry
insist
for
year
be
impossible
to
do
that

also
construct

revamp
the

tesla
s
ability
to
raise
money
from
eager
investor
be
a
newfound
luxury
tesla
have
border
on
bankruptcy
for
much
of
its
existence
and
be
one
major
technical
gaffe
from
obsolescence
at
all
time
the
money
couple
with
tesla
s
still
rise
share
price
and
strong
sale
have
put
the
company
in
a
position
to
open
lot
of
new
store
and
service
center
while
advance
its
manufacturing
capability
we
don
t
necessarily
need
all
of
the
money
for
the
gigafactory
right
now
but
i
decide
to
raise
it
in
advance
because
you
never
know
when
there
will
be
some
bloody
meltdown
musk
say
there
could
be
external
factor
or
there
could
be
some
unexpected
recall
and
then
suddenly
we
need
to
raise
money
on
top
of
deal
with
that
i
feel
a
bit
like
my
grandmother
she
live
through
the
great
depression
and
some
real
hard
time
once
you
ve
be
through
that
it
stay
with
you
for
a
long
time
i
m
not
sure
it
ever
leaf
really
so
i
do
feel
joy
now
but
there
s
still
that
nag
feel
that
it
might
all
go
away
even
later
in
life
when
my
grandmother
knew
there
be
really
no
possibility
of
her
go
hungry
she
always
have
this
thing
about
food
with
tesla
i
decide
to
raise
a
huge
amount
of
money
just
in
case
something
terrible
happens
musk
felt
optimistic
enough
about
tesla
s
future
to
talk
to
me
about
some
of
his
more
whimsical
plan
he
hope
to
redesign
the
tesla
headquarters
in
palo
alto
a
change
employee
would
welcome
the
building
with
its
tiny
s
era
lobby
and
a
kitchen
that
can
barely
handle
a
few
people
make
cereal
at
the
same
time
have
none
of
the
perk
of
a
typical
silicon
valley
darling
i
think
our
tesla
headquarters
look
like
crap
musk
say
we
re
go
to
spruce
thing
up
not
to
sort
of
the
google
level
you
have
to
be
like
make
money
hand
over
fist
in
order
to
be
able
to
spend
money
the
way
that
google
do
but
we
re
go
to
make
our
headquarters
much
nicer
and
put
in
a
restaurant
naturally
musk
have
idea
for
some
mechanical
enhancement
as
well
everybody
around
here
have
slide
in
their
lobby
he
say
i
m
actually
wonder
about
put
in
a
roller
coaster
like
a
functional
roller
coaster
at
the
factory
in
fremont
you
d
get
in
and
it
would
take
you
around
factory
but
also
up
and
down
who
else
have
a
roller
coaster
i
m
think
about
do
that
with
spacex
too
that
one
might
be
even
big
since
spacex
have
like
ten
building
now
it
would
probably
be
really
expensive
but
i
like
the
idea
of
it
what
s
fascinate
be
that
musk
remains
willing
to
lose
it
all
he
doesn
t
want
to
build
just
one
gigafactory
but
several
and
he
need
these
facility
to
be
built
quickly
and
flawlessly
so
that
they
re
crank
out
massive
quantity
of
battery
right
as
the
model
arrives
if
need
be
musk
will
build
a
second
gigafactory
to
compete
with
the
nevada
site
and
place
his
own
employee
in
competition
with
each
other
in
a
race
to
make
the
battery
first
we
re
not
really
try
to
sort
of
yank
anyone
s
chain
here
musk
say
it
s
just
like
this
thing
need
to
be
complete
on
time
if
we
suddenly
find
that
we
re
leveling
the
ground
and
lay
the
foundation
and
we
re
on
a
bloody
indian
burial
ground
then
fuck
we
can
t
say
oh
shit
let
s
go
back
to
the
other
place
that
we
be
think
about
and
get
a
six
month
reset
six
month
for
this
factory
be
a
huge
deal
do
the
basic
math
and
it
s
more
than
a
billion
dollar
a
month
in
lose
revenue
assume
we
use
it
to
capacity
from
a
different
standpoint
if
we
spend
all
the
money
to
prepare
the
car
factory
in
fremont
to
triple
the
volume
from
per
year
to
or
car
and
hire
and
train
all
the
people
and
we
re
just
sit
there
wait
for
the
factory
to
come
on
line
we
d
be
burning
money
like
it
be
go
out
of
fashion
i
think
that
could
kill
the
company
a
six
month
offset
would
be
like
like
gallipoli
you
have
to
make
sure
you
charge
right
after
the
bombardment
don
t
fuck
sit
around
for
two
hour
so
that
the
turk
can
go
back
in
the
trench
timing
be
important
we
have
to
do
everything
we
can
to
minimize
the
timing
risk
what
musk
struggle
to
fathom
be
why
other
automaker
with
deeper
pocket
aren
t
make
similar
move
at
a
minimum
tesla
seem
to
have
influence
consumer
and
the
auto
industry
enough
for
there
to
be
an
expect
surge
in
demand
for
electric
vehicle
i
think
we
have
move
the
needle
for
almost
every
car
company
musk
say
just
the
twenty
two
thousand
car
we
sell
in
have
a
highly
leveraged
effect
in
push
the
industry
toward
sustainable
technology
it
s
true
that
the
supply
for
lithium
ion
battery
be
already
constrain
and
tesla
look
like
the
only
company
address
the
problem
in
a
meaningful
way
the
competitor
be
all
sort
of
pooh
poohing
the
gigafactory
musk
say
they
think
it
s
a
stupid
idea
that
the
battery
supplier
should
just
go
build
something
like
that
but
i
know
all
the
supplier
and
i
can
tell
you
that
they
don
t
like
the
idea
of
spending
several
billion
dollar
on
a
battery
factory
you
ve
get
a
chicken
and
egg
problem
where
the
car
company
be
not
go
to
commit
to
a
giant
volume
because
they
re
not
sure
you
can
sell
enough
electric
car
so
i
know
we
can
t
get
enough
lithium
ion
battery
unless
we
build
this
bloody
factory
and
i
know
no
one
else
be
building
this
thing
there
s
the
potential
that
tesla
be
set
itself
up
to
capitalize
on
a
situation
like
the
one
apple
found
itself
in
when
it
first
introduce
the
iphone
apple
s
rival
spent
the
initial
year
after
the
iphone
s
release
dismiss
the
product
once
it
become
clear
apple
have
a
hit
the
competitor
have
to
catch
up
even
with
the
device
right
in
their
hand
it
take
company
like
htc
and
samsung
year
to
produce
anything
comparable
other
once
great
company
like
nokia
and
blackberry
didn
t
withstand
the
shock
if
and
it
s
a
big
if
tesla
s
model
turn
into
a
massive
hit
the
thing
that
everyone
with
enough
money
want
because
buying
something
else
would
just
be
pay
for
the
past
then
the
rival
automaker
would
be
in
a
terrible
bind
most
of
the
car
company
dabble
in
electric
vehicle
continue
to
buy
bulky
off
the
shelf
battery
rather
than
develop
their
own
technology
no
matter
how
much
they
want
to
respond
to
the
model
the
automaker
would
need
year
to
come
up
with
a
real
challenger
and
even
then
they
might
not
have
a
ready
supply
of
battery
for
their
vehicle
i
think
it
be
go
to
be
a
bit
like
that
musk
say
when
will
the
first
non
tesla
gigafactory
get
built
probably
no
sooner
than
six
year
from
now
the
big
car
company
be
so
derivative
they
want
to
see
it
work
somewhere
else
before
they
will
approve
the
project
and
move
forward
they
re
probably
more
like
seven
year
away
but
i
hope
i
m
wrong
musk
speaks
about
the
car
solar
panel
and
battery
with
such
passion
that
it
s
easy
to
forget
they
be
more
or
less
sideline
project
he
believe
in
the
technology
to
the
extent
that
he
think
they
re
the
right
thing
to
pursue
for
the
betterment
of
mankind
they
ve
also
brought
him
fame
and
fortune
musk
s
ultimate
goal
though
remains
turn
human
into
an
interplanetary
specie
this
may
sound
silly
to
some
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
be
musk
s
raison
d
tre
musk
have
decide
that
man
s
survival
depends
on
set
up
another
colony
on
another
planet
and
that
he
should
dedicate
his
life
to
make
this
happen
musk
be
now
quite
rich
on
paper
he
be
worth
about
billion
at
the
time
of
this
write
when
he
start
spacex
more
than
a
decade
ago
however
he
have
far
less
capital
at
his
disposal
he
didn
t
have
the
fuck
you
money
of
a
jeff
bezos
who
hand
his
space
company
blue
origin
a
kingly
pile
of
cash
and
ask
it
to
make
bezos
s
dream
come
true
if
musk
want
to
get
to
mar
he
would
have
to
earn
it
by
building
spacex
into
a
real
business
this
all
seem
to
have
work
in
musk
s
favor
spacex
have
learn
to
make
cheap
and
effective
rocket
and
to
push
the
limit
of
aerospace
technology
in
the
near
term
spacex
will
begin
test
its
ability
to
take
people
into
space
it
want
to
perform
a
man
test
flight
by
and
to
fly
astronaut
to
the
international
space
station
for
nasa
the
next
year
the
company
will
also
likely
make
a
major
move
into
building
and
sell
satellite
which
would
mark
an
expansion
into
one
of
the
most
lucrative
part
of
the
aerospace
business
along
with
these
effort
spacex
have
be
test
the
falcon
heavy
its
giant
rocket
capable
of
fly
the
big
payload
in
the
world
and
its
reusable
rocket
technology
in
early
spacex
almost
manage
to
land
the
first
stage
of
its
rocket
on
a
platform
in
the
ocean
once
it
succeed
it
will
begin
perform
test
on
land
in
spacex
also
begin
construction
on
its
own
spaceport
in
south
texas
it
have
acquire
dozen
of
acre
where
it
plan
to
construct
a
modern
rocket
launch
facility
unlike
anything
the
world
have
see
musk
want
to
automate
a
great
deal
of
the
launch
process
so
that
the
rocket
can
be
refuel
stood
up
and
fire
on
their
own
with
computer
handle
the
safety
procedure
spacex
want
to
fly
rocket
several
time
a
month
for
its
business
and
have
its
own
spaceport
should
help
speed
up
such
capability
get
to
mar
will
require
an
even
more
impressive
set
of
skill
and
technology
we
need
to
figure
out
how
to
launch
multiple
time
a
day
musk
say
the
thing
that
s
important
in
the
long
run
be
establish
a
self
sustain
base
on
mar
in
order
for
that
to
work
in
order
to
have
a
self
sustain
city
on
mar
there
would
need
to
be
million
of
ton
of
equipment
and
probably
million
of
people
so
how
many
launch
be
that
well
if
you
send
up
people
at
a
time
which
be
a
lot
to
go
on
such
a
long
journey
you
d
need
to
do
flight
to
get
to
a
million
people
so
flight
over
what
period
of
time
give
that
you
can
only
really
depart
for
mar
once
every
two
year
that
mean
you
would
need
like
forty
or
fifty
year
and
then
i
think
for
each
flight
that
departs
to
mar
you
want
to
sort
of
launch
the
spacecraft
into
orbit
and
then
have
it
be
in
a
parking
orbit
and
refuel
its
tank
with
propellant
essentially
the
spacecraft
would
use
a
bunch
of
its
propellant
to
get
to
orbit
but
then
you
send
up
a
tanker
spacecraft
to
fill
up
the
propellant
tank
of
the
spacecraft
so
that
it
can
depart
for
mar
at
high
speed
and
can
do
so
and
get
there
in
three
month
instead
of
six
month
and
with
a
large
payload
i
don
t
have
a
detailed
plan
for
mar
but
i
know
of
something
at
least
that
would
work
which
be
sort
of
this
all
methane
system
with
a
big
booster
a
spacecraft
and
a
tanker
potentially
i
think
spacex
will
have
developed
a
booster
and
spaceship
in
the
time
frame
capable
of
take
large
quantity
of
people
and
cargo
to
mar
the
thing
that
s
important
be
to
reach
an
economic
threshold
around
the
cost
per
person
for
a
trip
to
mar
if
it
cost
billion
per
person
there
will
be
no
mar
colony
at
around
million
or
per
person
i
think
it
s
highly
likely
that
there
will
be
a
self
sustain
martian
colony
there
will
be
enough
people
interested
who
will
sell
their
stuff
on
earth
and
move
it
s
not
about
tourism
it
s
like
people
come
to
america
back
in
the
new
world
day
you
move
get
a
job
there
and
make
thing
work
if
you
solve
the
transport
problem
it
s
not
that
hard
to
make
a
pressurize
transparent
greenhouse
to
live
in
but
if
you
can
t
get
there
in
the
first
place
it
doesn
t
matter
eventually
you
d
need
to
heat
mar
up
if
you
want
it
to
be
an
earthlike
planet
and
i
don
t
have
a
plan
for
that
that
would
take
a
long
time
in
the
best
of
circumstance
it
would
probably
take
i
don
t
know
somewhere
between
a
century
and
a
millennium
there
s
zero
chance
of
it
be
terraformed
and
earthlike
in
my
lifetime
not
zero
but
percent
chance
and
you
would
have
to
take
real
drastic
measure
with
mar
musk
spent
month
pace
around
his
home
in
los
angeles
late
at
night
think
about
these
plan
for
mar
and
bounce
them
off
riley
whom
he
remarry
near
the
end
of
i
mean
there
aren
t
that
many
people
you
can
talk
to
about
this
sort
of
thing
musk
say
these
chat
include
musk
daydream
aloud
about
become
the
first
man
to
set
foot
on
the
red
planet
he
definitely
want
to
be
the
first
man
on
mar
riley
say
i
have
beg
him
not
to
be
perhaps
musk
enjoys
tease
his
wife
or
maybe
he
s
play
coy
but
he
deny
this
ambition
during
one
of
our
late
night
chat
i
would
only
be
on
the
first
trip
to
mar
if
i
be
confident
that
spacex
would
be
fine
if
i
die
he
say
i
d
like
to
go
but
i
don
t
have
to
go
the
point
be
not
about
me
visit
mar
but
about
enable
large
number
of
people
to
go
to
the
planet
musk
may
not
even
go
into
space
he
do
not
plan
to
participate
in
spacex
s
upcoming
human
test
flight
i
don
t
think
that
would
be
wise
he
say
it
would
be
like
the
head
of
boeing
be
a
test
pilot
for
a
new
plane
it
s
not
the
right
thing
for
spacex
or
the
future
of
space
exploration
i
might
be
on
there
if
it
s
be
fly
for
three
or
four
year
honestly
if
i
never
go
to
space
that
will
be
okay
the
point
be
to
maximize
the
probable
life
span
of
humanity
it
s
difficult
to
gauge
just
how
seriously
the
average
person
take
musk
when
he
talk
like
this
a
few
year
ago
most
people
would
have
lump
him
into
the
category
of
people
who
hype
up
jet
pack
and
robot
and
whatever
else
silicon
valley
decide
to
fixate
on
for
the
moment
then
musk
file
away
one
accomplishment
after
another
transform
himself
from
big
talker
to
one
of
silicon
valley
s
most
revere
doer
thiel
have
watch
musk
go
through
this
maturation
from
the
driven
but
insecure
ceo
of
paypal
to
a
confident
ceo
who
command
the
respect
of
thousand
i
think
there
be
way
he
have
dramatically
improve
over
time
say
thiel
most
impressive
to
thiel
have
be
musk
s
ability
to
find
bright
ambitious
people
and
lure
them
to
his
company
he
have
the
most
talented
people
in
the
aerospace
industry
work
for
him
and
the
same
case
can
be
make
for
tesla
where
if
you
re
a
talented
mechanical
engineer
who
like
building
car
then
you
re
go
to
tesla
because
it
s
probably
the
only
company
in
the
u
s
where
you
can
do
interest
new
thing
both
company
be
design
with
this
vision
of
motivate
a
critical
mass
of
talented
people
to
work
on
inspire
thing
thiel
think
musk
s
goal
of
get
human
to
mar
should
be
take
seriously
and
believe
it
give
the
public
hope
not
everyone
will
identify
with
the
mission
but
the
fact
that
there
s
someone
out
there
push
exploration
and
our
technical
ability
to
their
limit
be
important
the
goal
of
send
a
man
to
mar
be
so
much
more
inspire
than
what
other
people
be
try
to
do
in
space
thiel
say
it
s
this
go
back
to
the
future
idea
there
s
be
this
long
wind
down
of
the
space
program
and
people
have
abandon
the
optimistic
vision
of
the
future
that
we
have
in
the
early
s
spacex
show
there
be
a
way
toward
bring
back
that
future
there
s
great
value
in
what
elon
be
do
the
true
believer
come
out
in
full
force
in
august
when
musk
unveiled
something
call
the
hyperloop
bill
as
a
new
mode
of
transportation
this
machine
be
a
large
scale
pneumatic
tube
like
the
one
use
to
send
mail
around
office
musk
propose
link
city
like
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
via
an
elevate
version
of
this
kind
of
tube
that
would
transport
people
and
car
in
pod
similar
idea
have
be
propose
before
but
musk
s
creation
have
some
unique
element
he
call
for
the
tube
to
run
under
low
pressure
and
for
the
pod
to
float
on
a
bed
of
air
produce
by
ski
at
their
base
each
pod
would
be
thrust
forward
by
an
electromagnetic
pulse
and
motor
place
throughout
the
tube
would
give
the
pod
add
boost
as
need
these
mechanism
could
keep
the
pod
go
at
mph
allow
someone
to
travel
from
los
angeles
to
san
francisco
in
about
thirty
minute
the
whole
thing
would
of
course
be
solar
power
and
aim
at
link
city
less
than
a
thousand
mile
apart
it
make
sense
for
thing
like
l
a
to
san
francisco
new
york
to
d
c
new
york
to
boston
musk
say
at
the
time
over
one
thousand
mile
the
tube
cost
start
to
become
prohibitive
and
you
don
t
want
tube
every
which
way
you
don
t
want
to
live
in
tube
land
musk
have
be
think
about
the
hyperloop
for
a
number
of
month
describe
it
to
friend
in
private
the
first
time
he
talk
about
it
to
anyone
outside
of
his
inner
circle
be
during
one
of
our
interview
musk
told
me
that
the
idea
originate
out
of
his
hatred
for
california
s
propose
high
speed
rail
system
the
sixty
billion
dollar
bullet
train
they
re
propose
in
california
would
be
the
slowest
bullet
train
in
the
world
at
the
high
cost
per
mile
musk
say
they
re
go
for
record
in
all
the
wrong
way
california
s
high
speed
rail
be
meant
to
allow
people
to
go
from
los
angeles
to
san
francisco
in
about
two
and
a
half
hour
upon
its
completion
in
wait
for
it
it
take
about
an
hour
to
fly
between
the
city
today
and
five
hour
to
drive
place
the
train
right
in
the
zone
of
mediocrity
which
particularly
gnawed
at
musk
he
insist
the
hyperloop
would
cost
about
billion
to
billion
go
faster
than
a
plane
and
let
people
drive
their
car
onto
a
pod
and
drive
out
into
a
new
city
at
the
time
it
seem
that
musk
have
dish
out
the
hyperloop
proposal
just
to
make
the
public
and
legislator
rethink
the
high
speed
train
he
didn
t
actually
intend
to
build
the
thing
it
be
more
that
he
want
to
show
people
that
more
creative
idea
be
out
there
for
thing
that
might
actually
solve
problem
and
push
the
state
forward
with
any
luck
the
high
speed
rail
would
be
cancel
musk
say
as
much
to
me
during
a
series
of
e
mail
and
phone
call
lead
up
to
the
announcement
down
the
road
i
might
fund
or
advise
on
a
hyperloop
project
but
right
now
i
can
t
take
my
eye
off
the
ball
at
either
spacex
or
tesla

call
to
talk
about
the
hyperloop
and
somewhere
in
between
our
numerous
earlier

and
that
moment
he
d
decide
to

tell

that
he
would
consider
make
at

a

there

a
time
when
electric

seem
silly
too

what
s
sillier
be
treat
this

anything

to

which

down

of

shervin

s
brought
the
detailed
specification
for
the

him
during
a
ninety

meeting
with

study
the

the

of

if
you
re

truly

say
something
deem
to
be
out
of
line
with
musk
s
view
or
with
what
he
want
the
public
to
think
straubel
have
dedicate
himself
to
make
electric
car
and
didn
t
want
some
dumb
reporter
wreck
his
life
s
work
i
try
really
hard
to
back
away
and
put
my
ego
aside
straubel
say
elon
be
incredibly
difficult
to
work
for
but
it
s
mostly
because
he
s
so
passionate
he
can
be
impatient
and
say
god
damn
it
this
be
what
we
have
to
do
and
some
people
will
get
shell
shock
and
catatonic
it
seem
like
people
can
get
afraid
of
him
and
paralyze
in
a
weird
way
i
try
to
help
everyone
to
understand
what
his
goal
and
vision
be
and
then
i
have
a
bunch
of
my
own
goal
too
and
make
sure
we
re
in
synch
then
i
try
and
go
back
and
make
sure
the
company
be
align
ultimately
elon
be
the
bos
he
have
driven
this
thing
with
his
blood
sweat
and
tear
he
have
risk
more
than
anyone
else
i
respect
the
hell
out
of
what
he
have
do
it
just
could
not
work
without
elon
in
my
view
he
have
earn
the
right
to
be
the
front
person
for
this
thing
the
rank
and
file
employee
tend
to
describe
musk
in
more
mixed
way
they
revere
his
drive
and
respect
how
demand
he
can
be
they
also
think
he
can
be
hard
to
the
point
of
mean
and
come
off
as
capricious
the
employee
want
to
be
close
to
musk
but
they
also
fear
that
he
ll
suddenly
change
his
mind
about
something
and
that
every
interaction
with
him
be
an
opportunity
to
be
fire
elon
s
bad
trait
by
far
in
my
opinion
be
a
complete
lack
of
loyalty
or
human
connection
say
one
former
employee
many
of
us
work
tirelessly
for
him
for
year
and
be
toss
to
the
curb
like
a
piece
of
litter
without
a
second
thought
maybe
it
be
calculate
to
keep
the
rest
of
the
workforce
on
their
toe
and
scar
maybe
he
be
just
able
to
detach
from
human
connection
to
a
remarkable
degree
what
be
clear
be
that
people
who
work
for
him
be
like
ammunition
use
for
a
specific
purpose
until
exhaust
and
discard
the
communication
department
of
spacex
and
tesla
have
witness
the
latter
form
of
behavior
more
than
any
other
group
of
employee
musk
have
burn
through
public
relation
staffer
with
comical
efficiency
he
tends
to
take
on
a
lot
of
the
communication
work
himself
write
news
release
and
contact
the
press
as
he
see
fit
quite
often
musk
do
not
let
his
communication
staff
in
on
his
agenda
ahead
of
the
hyperloop
announcement
for
example
his
representative
be
send
me
e
mail
to
find
out
the
time
and
date
for
the
press
conference
on
other
occasion
reporter
have
receive
an
alert
about
a
teleconference
with
musk
just
minute
before
it
start
this
be
not
a
function
of
the
pr
people
be
incompetent
in
get
word
of
the
event
out
the
truth
be
that
musk
have
only
let
them
know
about
his
plan
a
couple
of
minute
in
advance
and
they
be
scramble
to
catch
up
to
his
whim
when
musk
do
delegate
work
to
the
communication
staff
they
re
expect
to
jump
in
without
miss
a
beat
and
to
execute
at
the
high
level
some
of
this
staff
operating
under
this
mix
of
pressure
and
surprise
only
last
between
a
few
week
and
a
few
month
a
few
others
have
hung
on
for
a
couple
of
year
before
burning
out
or
be
fire
the
granddaddy
example
of
musk
s
seemingly
callous
interoffice
style
occur
in
early
when
he
fire
mary
beth
brown
to
describe
her
as
a
loyal
executive
assistant
would
be
grossly
inadequate
brown
often
felt
like
an
extension
of
musk
the
one
be
who
cross
over
into
all
of
his
world
for
more
than
a
decade
she
give
up
her
life
for
musk
traipse
back
and
forth
between
los
angeles
and
silicon
valley
every
week
while
work
late
into
the
night
and
on
weekend
brown
go
to
musk
and
ask
that
she
be
compensate
on
par
with
spacex
s
top
executive
since
she
be
handle
so
much
of
musk
s
schedule
across
two
company
do
public
relation
work
and
often
make
business
decision
musk
reply
that
brown
should
take
a
couple
of
week
off
and
he
would
take
on
her
duty
and
gauge
how
hard
they
be
when
brown
return
musk
let
her
know
that
he
didn
t
need
her
anymore
and
he
ask
shotwell
s
assistant
to
begin
schedule
his
meeting
brown
still
loyal
and
hurt
didn
t
want
to
discus
any
of
this
with
me
musk
say
that
she
have
become
too
comfortable
speak
on
his
behalf
and
that
frankly
she
need
a
life
other
people
grumble
that
brown
and
riley
clashed
and
that
this
be
the
root
cause
of
brown
s
ouster
brown
decline
to
be
interviewed
for
this
book
despite
several
request
whatever
the
case
the
optic
of
the
situation
be
terrible
tony
stark
doesn
t
fire
pepper
potts
he
adores
her
and
take
care
of
her
for
life
she
s
the
only
person
he
can
really
trust
the
one
who
have
be
there
through
everything
that
musk
be
willing
to
let
brown
go
and
in
such
an
unceremonious
fashion
struck
people
inside
spacex
and
tesla
as
scandalous
and
as
the
ultimate
confirmation
of
his
cruel
stoicism
the
tale
of
brown
s
departure
become
part
of
the
lore
around
musk
s
lack
of
empathy
it
get
bundle
up
into
the
story
of
musk
dress
employee
down
in
legendary
fashion
with
vicious
barb
after
vicious
barb
people
also
link
this
type
of
behavior
to
musk
s
other
quirky
trait
he
s
be
know
to
ob
over
typo
in
e
mail
to
the
point
that
he
could
not
see
past
the
error
and
read
the
actual
content
of
the
message
even
in
social
setting
musk
might
get
up
from
the
dinner
table
without
a
word
of
explanation
to
head
outside
and
look
at
the
star
simply
because
he
s
not
willing
to
suffer
fool
or
small
talk
after
add
up
this
behavior
dozen
of
people
express
to
me
their
conclusion
that
musk
sits
somewhere
on
the
autism
spectrum
and
that
he
have
trouble
consider
other
people
s
emotion
and
care
about
their
well
be
there
s
a
tendency
especially
in
silicon
valley
to
label
people
who
be
a
bit
different
or
quirky
as
autistic
or
afflict
with
asperger
s
syndrome
it
s
armchair
psychology
for
condition
that
can
be
inherently
funky
to
diagnose
or
even
codify
to
slap
this
label
on
musk
feel
ill
inform
and
too
easy
musk
act
differently
with
his
closest
friend
and
family
than
he
do
with
employee
even
those
who
have
work
alongside
him
for
a
long
time
among
his
inner
circle
musk
be
warm
funny
and
deeply
emotional
he
might
not
engage
in
the
standard
chitchat
ask
a
friend
how
his
kid
be
do
but
he
would
do
everything
in
his
considerable
power
to
help
that
friend
if
his
child
be
sick
or
in
trouble
he
will
protect
those
close
to
him
at
all
cost
and
when
deem
necessary
seek
to
destroy
those
who
have
wrong
him
or
his
friend
musk
s
behavior
match
up
much
more
closely
with
someone
who
be
described
by
neuropsychologists
as
profoundly
gift
these
be
people
who
in
childhood
exhibit
exceptional
intellectual
depth
and
max
out
iq
test
it
s
not
uncommon
for
these
child
to
look
out
into
the
world
and
find
flaw
glitch
in
the
system
and
construct
logical
path
in
their
mind
to
fix
them
for
musk
the
call
to
ensure
that
mankind
be
a
multiplanetary
specie
partly
stem
from
a
life
richly
influence
by
science
fiction
and
technology
equally
it
s
a
moral
imperative
that
date
back
to
his
childhood
in
some
form
this
have
forever
be
his
mandate
each
facet
of
musk
s
life
might
be
an
attempt
to
soothe
a
type
of
existential
depression
that
seem
to
gnaw
at
his
every
fiber
he
see
man
as
self
limit
and
in
peril
and
want
to
fix
the
situation
the
people
who
suggest
bad
idea
during
meeting
or
make
mistake
at
work
be
get
in
the
way
of
all
of
this
and
slow
musk
down
he
do
not
dislike
them
as
people
it
s
more
that
he
feel
pain
by
their
mistake
which
have
consign
man
to
peril
that
much
longer
the
perceive
lack
of
emotion
be
a
symptom
of
musk
sometimes
feel
like
he
s
the
only
one
who
really
grasp
the
urgency
of
his
mission
he
s
less
sensitive
and
less
tolerant
than
other
people
because
the
stake
be
so
high
employee
need
to
help
solve
the
problem
to
the
absolute
best
of
their
ability
or
they
need
to
get
out
of
the
way
musk
have
be
pretty
up
front
about
these
tendency
he
s
implore
people
to
understand
that
he
s
not
chase
momentary
opportunity
in
the
business
world
he
s
try
to
solve
problem
that
have
be
consume
him
for
decade
during
our
conversation
musk
go
back
to
this
very
point
over
and
over
again
make
sure
to
emphasize
just
how
long
he
d
thought
about
electric
car
and
space
the
same
pattern
be
visible
in
his
action
as
well
when
musk
announce
in
that
tesla
would
open
source
all
of
its
patent
analyst
try
to
decide
whether
this
be
a
publicity
stunt
or
if
it
hid
an
ulterior
motive
or
a
catch
but
the
decision
be
a
straightforward
one
for
musk
he
want
people
to
make
and
buy
electric
car
man
s
future
as
he
see
it
depends
on
this
if
open
source
tesla
s
patent
mean
other
company
can
build
electric
car
more
easily
then
that
be
good
for
mankind
and
the
idea
should
be
free
the
cynic
will
scoff
at
this
and
understandably
so
musk
however
have
be
programmed
to
behave
this
way
and
tends
to
be
sincere
when
explain
his
think
almost
to
a
fault
the
people
who
get
closest
to
musk
be
the
one
who
learn
to
relate
to
this
mode
of
think
they
re
the
one
who
can
identify
with
his
vision
yet
challenge
him
intellectually
to
complete
it
when
he
ask
me
during
one
of
our
dinner
if
i
thought
he
be
insane
it
be
a
test
of
sort
we
have
talk
enough
that
he
knew
i
be
interested
in
what
he
be
do
he
have
start
to
trust
me
and
open
up
but
want
to
make
sure
one
final
time
that
i
truly
grasped
the
importance
of
his
quest
many
of
his
closest
friend
have
pass
much
grander
more
demand
test
they
ve
invest
in
his
company
they
ve
defend
him
against
critic
they
help
him
keep
the
wolf
at
bay
during
they
ve
proven
their
loyalty
and
their
commitment
to
his
cause
people
in
the
technology
industry
have
tend
to
liken
musk
s
drive
and
the
scope
of
his
ambition
to
that
of
bill
gate
and
steve
job
elon
have
that
deep
appreciation
for
technology
the
no
hold
bar
attitude
of
a
visionary
and
that
determination
to
go
after
long
term
thing
that
they
both
have
say
edward
jung
a
child
prodigy
who
work
for
job
and
gate
and
end
up
as
microsoft
s
chief
software
architect
and
he
have
that
consumer
sensibility
of
steve
along
with
the
ability
to
hire
good
people
outside
of
his
own
comfort
area
that
s
more
like
bill
you
almost
wish
that
bill
and
steve
have
a
genetically
engineer
love
child
and
who
know
maybe
we
should
genotype
elon
to
see
if
that
s
what
happen
steve
jurvetson
the
venture
capitalist
who
have
invest
in
spacex
tesla
and
solarcity
work
for
job
and
know
gate
well
also
described
musk
as
an
upgraded
mix
of
the
two
like
job
elon
do
not
tolerate
c
or
d
player
say
jurvetson
but
i
d
say
he
s
nicer
than
job
and
a
bit
more
refine
than
bill
gate
but
the
more
you
know
about
musk
the
harder
it
becomes
to
place
him
among
his

the

in

cowen
described
musk
not

as

not

you

example
of
the

the

have
to

have
emerge
as
the
most
likely
candidate
he
s
certainly
the
it
guy
of
the
moment
start
up
founder
proven
executive
and
legend
hold
him
up
as
the
person
they
most
admire
the
more
mainstream
tesla
can
become
the
more
musk
s
reputation
will
rise
a
hot
sell
model
would
certify
musk
as
that
rare
be
able
to
rethink
an
industry
read
consumer
and
execute
from
there
his
more
fanciful
idea
start
to
seem
inevitable
elon
be
one
of
the
few
people
that
i
feel
be
more
accomplish
than
i
be
say
craig
venter
the
man
who
decode
the
human
genome
and
go
on
to
create
synthetic
lifeforms
at
some
point
he
hope
to
work
with
musk
on
a
type
of
dna
printer
that
could
be
sent
to
mar
it
would
in
theory
allow
human
to
create
medicine
food
and
helpful
microbe
for
early
settler
of
the
planet
i
think
biological
teleportation
be
what
be
go
to
truly
enable
the
colonization
of
space
he
say
elon
and
i
have
be
talk
about
how
this
might
play
out
one
of
musk
s
most
ardent
admirer
be
also
one
of
his
best
friend
larry
page
the
cofounder
and
ceo
of
google
page
have
end
up
on
musk
s
house
surf
schedule
he
s
kind
of
homeless
which
i
think
be
sort
of
funny
page
say
he
ll
e
mail
and
say
i
don
t
know
where
to
stay
tonight
can
i
come
over
i
haven
t
give
him
a
key
or
anything
yet
google
have
invest
more
than
just
about
any
other
technology
company
into
musk
s
sort
of
moon
shot
project
self
drive
car
robot
and
even
a
cash
prize
to
get
a
machine
onto
the
moon
cheaply
the
company
however
operates
under
a
set
of
constraint
and
expectation
that
come
with
employ
ten
of
thousand
of
people
and
be
analyze
constantly
by
investor
it
s
with
this
in
mind
that
page
sometimes
feel
a
bit
envious
of
musk
who
have
manage
to
make
radical
idea
the
basis
of
his
company
if
you
think
about
silicon
valley
or
corporate
leader
in
general
they
re
not
usually
lack
in
money
page
say
if
you
have
all
this
money
which
presumably
you
re
go
to
give
away
and
couldn
t
even
spend
it
all
if
you
want
to
why
then
be
you
devote
your
time
to
a
company
that
s
not
really
do
anything
good
that
s
why
i
find
elon
to
be
an
inspire
example
he
say
well
what
should
i
really
do
in
this
world
solve
car
global
warm
and
make
human
multiplanetary
i
mean
those
be
pretty
compelling
goal
and
now
he
have
business
to
do
that
this
becomes
a
competitive
advantage
for
him
too
why
would
you
want
to
work
for
a
defense
contractor
when
you
can
work
for
a
guy
who
want
to
go
to
mar
and
he
s
go
to
move
heaven
and
earth
to
make
it
happen
you
can
frame
a
problem
in
a
way
that
s
really
good
for
the
business
at
one
point
a
quotation
from
page
make
the
round
say
that
he
want
to
leave
all
of
his
money
to
musk
page
felt
he
be
misquote
but
stood
by
the
sentiment
i
m
not
leave
my
money
to
him
at
the
moment
page
say
but
elon
make
a
pretty
compelling
case
for
have
a
multiplanetary
society
just
because
you
know
otherwise
we
might
all
die
which
seem
like
it
would
be
sad
for
all
sort
of
different
reason
i
think
it
s
a
very
doable
project
and
it
s
a
relatively
modest
resource
that
we
need
to
set
up
a
permanent
human
settlement
on
mar
i
be
just
try
to
make
the
point
that
that
s
a
really
powerful
idea
as
page
put
it
good
idea
be
always
crazy
until
they
re
not
it
s
a
principle
he
s
try
to
apply
at
google
when
page
and
sergey
brin
begin
wonder
aloud
about
develop
way
to
search
the
text
inside
of
book
all
of
the
expert
they
consult
say
it
would
be
impossible
to
digitize
every
book
the
google
cofounder
decide
to
run
the
number
and
see
if
it
be
actually
physically
possible
to
scan
the
book
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
they
conclude
it
be
and
google
have
since
scan
million
of
book
i
ve
learn
that
your
intuition
about
thing
you
don
t
know
that
much
about
isn
t
very
good
page
say
the
way
elon
talk
about
this
be
that
you
always
need
to
start
with
the
first
principle
of
a
problem
what
be
the
physic
of
it
how
much
time
will
it
take
how
much
will
it
cost
how
much
cheaper
can
i
make
it
there
s
this
level
of
engineering
and
physic
that
you
need
to
make
judgment
about
what
s
possible
and
interest
elon
be
unusual
in
that
he
know
that
and
he
also
know
business
and
organization
and
leadership
and
governmental
issue
some
of
the
conversation
between
musk
and
page
take
place
at
a
secret
apartment
google
own
in
downtown
palo
alto
it
s
inside
of
one
of
the
taller
building
in
the
area
and
offer
view
of
the
mountain
surround
the
stanford
university
campus
page
and
brin
will
take
private
meeting
at
the
apartment
and
have
their
own
chef
on
call
to
prepare
food
for
guest
when
musk
be
present
the
chat
tend
toward
the
absurd
and
fantastic
i
be
there
once
and
elon
be
talk
about
building
an
electric
jet
plane
that
can
take
off
and
land
vertically
say
george
zachary
the
venture
capitalist
and
friend
of
musk
s
larry
say
the
plane
should
be
able
to
land
on
ski
slope
and
sergey
say
it
need
to
be
able
to
dock
at
a
port
in
manhattan
then
they
start
talk
about
building
a
commuter
plane
that
be
always
circle
the
earth
and
you
d
hop
up
to
it
and
get
place
incredibly
fast
i
thought
everyone
be
kid
but
at
the
end
i
ask
elon
be
you
really
go
to
do
that
and
he
say
yes
it
s
kind
of
our
recreation
i
guess
say
page
it
s
fun
for
the
three
of
us
to
talk
about
kind
of
crazy
thing
and
we
find
stuff
that
eventually
turn
out
to
be
real
we
go
through
hundred
or
thousand
of
possible
thing
before
arrive
at
the
one
that
be
most
promising
page
talk
about
musk
at
time
as
if
he
be
a
one
of
a
kind
a
force
of
nature
able
to
accomplish
thing
in
the
business
world
that
others
would
never
even
try
we
think
of
spacex
and
tesla
as
be
these
tremendously
risky
thing
but
i
think
elon
be
go
to
make
them
work
no
matter
what
he
s
willing
to
suffer
some
personal
cost
and
i
think
that
make
his
odds
actually
pretty
good
if
you
knew
him
personally
you
would
look
back
to
when
he
start
the
company
and
say
his
odds
of
success
would
be
more
than
ninety
percent
i
mean
we
just
have
a
single
proof
point
now
that
you
can
be
really
passionate
about
something
that
other
people
think
be
crazy
and
you
can
really
succeed
and
you
look
at
it
with
elon
and
you
say
well
maybe
it
s
not
luck
he
s
do
it
twice
it
can
t
be
luck
totally
i
think
that
mean
it
should
be
repeatable
in
some
sense
at
least
it
s
repeatable
by
him
maybe
we
should
get
him
to
do
more
thing
page
hold
musk
up
as
a
model
he
wish
others
would
emulate
a
figure
that
should
be
replicate
during
a
time
in
which
the
businessmen
and
politician
have
fixate
on
short
term
inconsequential
goal
i
don
t
think
we
re
do
a
good
job
as
a
society
decide
what
thing
be
really
important
to
do
page
say
i
think
like
we
re
just
not
educate
people
in
this
kind
of
general
way
you
should
have
a
pretty
broad
engineering
and
scientific
background
you
should
have
some
leadership
training
and
a
bit
of
mba
training
or
knowledge
of
how
to
run
thing
organize
stuff
and
raise
money
i
don
t
think
most
people
be
do
that
and
it
s
a
big
problem
engineer
be
usually
train
in
a
very
fix
area
when
you
re
able
to
think
about
all
of
these
discipline
together
you
kind
of
think
differently
and
can
dream
of
much
crazier
thing
and
how
they
might
work
i
think
that
s
really
an
important
thing
for
the
world
that
s
how
we
make
progress
the
pressure
of
feel
the
need
to
fix
the
world
take
its
toll
on
musk
s
body
there
be
time
when
you
run
into
musk
and
he
look
utterly
exhaust
he
do
not
have
bag
under
his
eye
but
rather
deep
shadowy
valley
during
the
bad
of
time
follow
week
of
sleep
deprivation
his
eye
seem
to
have
sunk
back
into
his
skull
musk
s
weight
move
up
and
down
with
the
stress
and
he
s
usually
heavier
when
really
overwork
it
s
funny
in
a
way
that
musk
spends
so
much
time
talk
about
man
s
survival
but
isn
t
willing
to
address
the
consequence
of
what
his
lifestyle
do
to
his
body
elon
come
to
the
conclusion
early
in
his
career
that
life
be
short
straubel
say
if
you
really
embrace
this
it
leaf
you
with
the
obvious
conclusion
that
you
should
be
work
as
hard
as
you
can
suffer
though
have
always
be
musk
s
thing
the
kid
at
school
torture
him
his
father
played
brutal
mind
game
musk
then
abuse
himself
by
work
inhumane
hour
and
forever
push
his
business
to
the
edge
the
idea
of
work
life
balance
seem
meaningless
in
this
context
for
musk
it
s
just
life
and
his
wife
and
kid
try
to
fit
into
the
show
where
they
can
i
m
a
pretty
good
dad
musk
say
i
have
the
kid
for
slightly
more
than
half
the
week
and
spend
a
fair
bit
of
time
with
them
i
also
take
them
with
me
when
i
go
out
of
town
recently
we
go
to
the
monaco
grand
prix
and
be
hang
out
with
the
prince
and
princess
of
monaco
it
all
seem
quite
normal
to
the
kid
and
they
be
blas
about
it
they
be
grow
up
have
a
set
of
experience
that
be
extremely
unusual
but
you
don
t
realize
experience
be
unusual
until
you
be
much
old
they
re
just
your
experience
they
have
good
manner
at
meal
it
bother
musk
a
bit
that
his
kid
won
t
suffer
like
he
do
he
feel
that
the
suffer
help
to
make
him
who
he
be
and
give
him
extra
reserve
of
strength
and
will
they
might
have
a
little
adversity
at
school
but
these
day
school
be
so
protective
he
say
if
you
call
someone
a
name
you
get
sent
home
when
i
be
go
to
school
if
they
punch
you
and
there
be
no
blood
it
be
like
whatever
shake
it
off
even
if
there
be
a
little
blood
but
not
a
lot
it
be
fine
what
do
i
do
create
artificial
adversity
how
do
you
do
that
the
big
battle
i
have
be
restrict
their
video
game
time
because
they
want
to
play
all
the
time
the
rule
be
they
have
to
read
more
than
they
play
video
game
they
also
can
t
play
completely
stupid
video
game
there
s
one
game
they
download
recently
call
cooky
or
something
you
literally
tap
a
fuck
cookie
it
s
like
a
psych
experiment
i
make
them
delete
the
cookie
game
they
have
to
play
flappy
golf
instead
which
be
like
flappy
bird
but
at
least
there
be
some
physic
involve
musk
have
talk
about
have
more
kid
and
it
s
on
this
subject
that
he
delivers
some
controversial
philosophize
vi
vi
the
creator
of
beavis
and
butt
head
there
s
this
point
that
mike
judge
make
in
idiocracy
which
be
like
smart
people
you
know
should
at
least
sustain
their
number
musk
say
like
if
it
s
a
negative
darwinian
vector
then
obviously
that
s
not
a
good
thing
it
should
be
at
least
neutral
but
if
each
successive
generation
of
smart
people
have
few
kid
that
s
probably
bad
too
i
mean
europe
japan
russia
china
be
all
head
for
demographic
implosion
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
basically
the
wealthier
basically
wealth
education
and
be
secular
be
all
indicative
of
low
birth
rate
they
all
correlate
with
low
birth
rate
i
m
not
say
like
only
smart
people
should
have
kid
i
m
just
say
that
smart
people
should
have
kid
as
well
they
should
at
least
maintain
at
least
be
a
replacement
rate
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
i
notice
that
a
lot
of
really
smart
woman
have
zero
or
one
kid
you
re
like
wow
that
s
probably
not
good
the
next
decade
of
musk
co
should
be
quite
something
musk
have
give
himself
a
chance
to
become
one
of
the
great
businessmen
and
innovator
of
all
time
by
tesla
could
very
well
have
a
lineup
of
five
or
six
car
and
be
the
dominant
force
in
a
boom
electric
car
market
play
off
its
current
growth
rate
solarcity
will
have
have
time
to
emerge
as
a
massive
utility
company
and
the
leader
in
a
solar
market
that
have
finally
live
up
to
its
promise
spacex
well
it
s
perhaps
the
most
intrigue
accord
to
musk
s
calculation
spacex
should
be
conduct
weekly
flight
to
space
carry
human
and
cargo
and
have
put
most
of
its
competitor
out
of
business
its
rocket
should
be
capable
of
do
a
couple
of
lap
around
the
moon
and
then
land
with
pinpoint
accuracy
back
at
the
spaceport
in
texas
and
the
preparation
for
the
first
few
dozen
trip
to
mar
should
be
well
under
way
if
all
of
this
be
take
place
musk
then
in
his
mid
fifty
likely
would
be
the
richest
man
in
the
world
and
among
its
most
powerful
he
would
be
the
majority
shareholder
in
three
public
company
and
history
would
be
prepare
to
smile
broadly
on
what
he
have
accomplish
during
a
time
in
which
country
and
other
business
be
paralyze
by
indecision
and
inaction
musk
would
have
mount
the
most
viable
charge
against
global
warm
while
also
provide
people
with
an
escape
plan
just
in
case
he
would
have
brought
a
substantial
amount
of
crucial
manufacturing
back
to
the
united
state
while
also
provide
an
example
for
other
entrepreneur
hop
to
harness
a
new
age
of
wonderful
machine
as
thiel
say
musk
may
well
have
go
so
far
as
to
give
people
hope
and
to
have
renew
their
faith
in
what
technology
can
do
for
mankind
this
future
of
course
remains
precarious
huge
technological
issue
confront
all
three
of
musk
s
company
he
s
bet
on
the
inventiveness
of
man
and
the
ability
of
solar
battery
and
aerospace
technology
to
follow
predict
price
and
performance
curve
even
if
these
bet
hit
as
he
hope
tesla
could
face
a
weird
unexpected
recall
spacex
could
have
a
rocket
carry
human
blow
up
an
incident
that
could
very
well
end
the
company
on
the
spot
dramatic
risk
accompany
just
about
everything
musk
do
by
the
time
our
last
dinner
have
come
around
i
have
decide
that
this
propensity
for
risk
have
little
to
do
with
musk
be
insane
as
he
have
wonder
aloud
several
month
earlier
no
musk
just
seem
to
posse
a
level
of
conviction
that
be
so
intense
and
exceptional
as
to
be
off
put
to
some
as
we
share
some
chip
and
guacamole
and
cocktail
i
ask
musk
directly
just
how
much
he
be
willing
to
put
on
the
line
his
response
everything
that
other
people
hold
dear
i
would
like
to
die
on
mar
he
say
just
not
on
impact
ideally
i
d
like
to
go
for
a
visit
come
back
for
a
while
and
then
go
there
when
i
m
like
seventy
or
something
and
then
just
stay
there
if
thing
turn
out
well
that
would
be
the
case
if
my
wife
and
i
have
a
bunch
of
kid
she
would
probably
stay
with
them
on
earth

a
body
that
remains
very
much
in
motion
by
the
time
this
book
reach
your
hand
it
s
quite
possible
that
musk
and
spacex
will
have
manage
to
land
a
rocket
on
a
barge
at
sea
or
back
on
a
launchpad
in
florida
tesla
motor
may
have
unveiled
some
of
the
special
feature
of
the
model
x
musk
could
have
formally
declare
war
on

to
life
inside
of
google
s

who
know
what
s
clear
be
that
musk
s
desire
to
take
on
more
keep
grow
just
as
i
be
put
the
finish
touch
on
this
book
musk
unfurled
a
number
of
major
initiative
the
most
dramatic
of
which
be
a
plan
to
surround
the
earth
with
thousand
of
small
communication
satellite
musk
want
in
effect
to
build
a
space
base
internet
in
which
the
satellite
would
be
close
enough
to
the
planet
to
beam
down
bandwidth
at
high
speed
such
a
system
would
be
useful
for
a
couple
of
reason
in
area
too
poor
or
too
remote
to
have
fiber
optic
connection
it
would
provide
people
with
high
speed
internet
for
the
first
time
it
could
also
function
as
an
efficient
backhaul
network
for
business
and
consumer
musk
of
course
also
see
this
space
internet
as
key
to
his
long
term
ambition
around
mar
it
will
be
important
for
mar
to
have
a
global
communication
network
he
say
i
think
this
need
to
be
do
and
i
don
t
see
anyone
else
do
it
spacex
will
build
these
satellite
at
a
new
factory
and
will
also
look
to
sell
more
satellite
to
commercial
customer
as
it
perfect
the
technology
to
fund
part
of
this
unbelievably
ambitious
project
spacex
secure
billion
from
google
and
fidelity
in
a
rare
moment
of
restraint
musk
decline
to
provide
an
exact
delivery
date
for
his
space
internet
which
he
forecast
will
cost
more
than
billion
to
build
people
should
not
expect
this
to
be
active
sooner
than
five
year
he
say
but
we
see
it
as
a
long
term
revenue
source
for
spacex
to
be
able
to
fund
a
city
on
mar
meanwhile
solarcity
have
purchase
a
new
research
and

near

the

symbol
of
musk
s
ability
to
thrive
in
the
green
technology
industry
that
have
destroyed
so
many
other

tesla
continue
to
build
its
gigafactory
in
nevada
at
pace

its

in

would
let
people
hop
off

for
period
of
time
musk
then
one
upped
straubel
bragging
that
he
think
tesla
could
eventually
be
more
valuable
than
apple
and
could
challenge
it
in
the
race
to
be

around

oh
and
musk
star
in
an
episode
of
the

musk
who
fell
to

in
which
homer
become
his
inventive
muse
the
heady
expansion
plan
and
triumphant
rhetoric
from
musk
be
still
not
quite
enough
to
hide
all
of
musk
co
s
flaw
early
marked
the
vociferous
return
of
musk
s
detractor
on
wall
street
tesla
s
sale
in
china
be
lackluster
by
any
measure
and
some
analyst
renew
their
doubt
about
how
much
long
term
demand
there
would
be
for
the
model
s
tesla
s
share
slump
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
musk
sound
fluster
try
to
defend
the
company
s
position
the
personal
cost
of
musk
s
lifestyle
be
more
severe
musk
announce
that
once
again
he
would
be
divorce
talulah
riley
accord
to
musk
riley
want
a
simpler
small
life
in
england
and
have
come
to
despise
los
angeles
try
to
talk
her
out
of
it
but
she
insist
musk
told
me
it
be
possible
that
she
will
change
her
mind
at
some
point
but
not
anytime
soon
after
finish
my
reporting
and
write
for
this
book
i
have
a
chance
to
speak
with
some
of
musk
s
confidante
and
employee
in
a
more
relaxed
manner
and
bounce
various
idea
off
of
them
i
m
more
convince
than
ever
that
musk
be
and
have
always
be
a
man
on
a
quest
and
that
his
brand
of
quest
be
far
more
fantastic
and
consume
than
anything
most
of
us
will
ever
experience
it
seem
that
he
s
become
almost
addict
to
expand
his
ambition
and
can
t
quite
stop
himself
from
announce
thing
like
the
hyperloop
and
the
space
internet
i
m
also
more
convince
than
ever
that
musk
be
a
deeply
emotional
person
who
suffers
and
rejoices
in
an
epic
fashion
this
side
of
him
be
likely
obscure
by
the
fact
that
he
feel
most
deeply
about
his
own
humanity
alter
quest
and
so
have
trouble
recognize
the
strong
emotion
of
those
around
him
this
tends
to
make
musk
come
off
as
aloof
and
hard
i
would
argue
however
that
his
brand
of
empathy
be
unique
he
seem
to
feel
for
the
human
specie
as
a
whole
without
always
want
to
consider
the
want
and
need
of
individual
and
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
this
be
exactly
the
type
of
person
it
take
to
make
a
freak
space
internet
real
