more
than
a
suitcase
a
few
hundred
dollar
and
a
dream
to
build
a
well
life
i
sail
on
a
one
way
ticket
from
rotterdam
in
late
april
of
that
year

four
to
a
cabin
i
be
year
old
and
i
can
still
recall
as
if
it
be
yesterday
my
anxiety
and
sense
of
anticipation
as
the
ship
pull
away
from
the
dock
its
horn
blasting
at
one
point
i
even
thought
of
dive
off
the
deck
and
swim
back
to
shore
before
the
ship
sail
too
far
from
the
harbour
and
out
toward
the
vast
expanse
of
ocean
but

read
and
heard
too
many
story
about
young
men
and
woman
who
go
to
the
new
world
and
hit
it
big
i
want
to
be
one
of
those
people
it
be
early
in
the
morning
when
the
ship
arrive
in
quebec
city
about
nine
day
later
as
we
sail
up
the
st
lawrence
river
i
could
see
the
low
rise
hill
along
the
shore
still
dot
with
patch
of
snow
and
i
remember
think
how
massive
and
impose
the
terrain
look
i
thought
this
be
how
christopher
columbus
must
have
felt
when
we
finally
docked
i
be
so
relieve
to
feel
the
solid
ground
beneath
my
foot
we
file
into
long
line
and
a
canadian
immigration
officer
stamp
my
passport
and
hand
me
a
railroad
ticket
to
montreal
i
arrive
at
the
downtown
train
station
a
few
hour
later
i
have
never
see
anything
so
large
in
all
my
life
i
didn
t
know
which
way
to
turn
or
where
to
exit
clutch
my
small
suitcase
i
begin
walk
the
street
of
what
be
then

big
city

alone
and
full
of
wonder
about
what
my
future

hold
i

just
one
thought
on
my
mind
find
room
and
board

only
have
a
few
hundred
buck
and
i
would
have

quickly
if

and
ask
if

a
room
but
i
have
no
luck
perhaps
it
be
because
i
be
seasick
for
most
of
the
voyage
to
canada
and
i
look
rag
and
run

some
people

t
want
to
rent
to
an
immigrant
fresh
off

part
clang
into
steel
bin
sound
like
coin
cascade
into
a
bucket
put
it
in
write
when
i
be
manager
of
a
tool
shop
the
owner
one
day
offer
me
a
partnership
the
term
of
the
partnership
be
a
bit
vague
but
still
very
appeal
however
the
owner
never
get
around
to
present
me
with
a
write
offer
not
long
after
i
left
and
start
my
own
business
several
year
later
the
manager
of
one
of
my
factory
told
me
he
want
to
leave
and
start
his
own
business
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
him
so
i
offer
him
a
share
of
the
ownership
and
a
cut
of
the
profit
and
he
agree
i
have
learn
a
valuable
lesson
from
the
time
when
i
be
offer
a
partnership
if
you
re
serious
about
your
offer
put
it
in
write
chapter
the
magna
success
formula
share
profit
and
ownership
magna
be
much
more
than
a
company
it
be
a
whole
new
economic
culture
a
year
after
the
first
auto
part
contract
we
have
double
in
size
to
twenty
people
and
a
year
after
that
my
small
business
be
grow
so
quickly
that
we
move
from
our
small
rent
garage
to
a
new
factory
in
the
suburb
north
of
toronto
it
be
a
square
foot
plant
and
i
draft
the
plan
contract
the
work
and
supervise
the
construction
one
day
i
notice
that
my
foreman
herman
koob
be
act
a
little
oddly
so
i
ask
him
what
be
wrong
well
he
say
i
ve
be
think
about
start
my
own
business
herman
felt
much
the
same
way
that
i
do
when
i
be
manage
someone
else
s
tool
and
die
shop
several
year
earlier
he
be
itch
to
go
out
on
his
own
to
be
his
own
bos
but
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
a
top
notch
operator
like
herman
i
could
have
double
his
salary
but
it
would
have
be
only
a
temporary
fix
it
would
not
have
fill
the
hunger
he
have
to
be
an
owner
to
run
his
own
show
there
s
something
special
about
ownership
that
go
much
deeper
than
mere
financial
gain
i
realize
that
if
herman
left
his
departure
would
stifle
the
company
s
growth
i
also
realize
that
if
i
hire
a
new
foreman
and
i
didn
t
show
him
all
the
rope
on
how
to
run
the
business
then
i
would
end
up
still
do
most
of
the
work
and
i
didn
t
like
that
prospect
very
much
my
next
thought
be
that
if
i
taught
the
new
foreman
everything
i
knew
he
might
eventually
want
to
leave
and
start
his
own
business
too
the
same
way
i
do
and
the
same
way
herman
felt
so
i
come
up
with
a
simple
solution
i
ask
herman
to
become
a
partner
in
the
business
i
have
learn
two
valuable
lesson
from
the
time
a
few
year
earlier
when
i
be
offer
a
partnership
that
never
materialize
the
first
lesson
be
to
put
any
serious
offer
in
write
the
second
lesson
be
to
make
the
term
of
the
partnership
agreement
crystal
clear
the
next
day
i
sat
down
with
herman
and
say
why
don
t
we
open
up
a
new
factory
and
you
could
have
a
one
third
ownership
we
draft
an
agreement
fairly
quickly
he
would
get
a
base
salary
and
no
more
overtime
i
say
look
you
ve
get
to
hustle
and
if
you
make
a
profit
you
get
a
portion
and
i
get
a
portion
herman
do
not
have
a
lot
of
money
to
invest
but
he
have
a
lot
of
drive
and
initiative
i
open
a
second
factory
dieomatic
with
herman
in
charge
we
put
up
the
money
need
to
build
the
factory
bought
the
machinery
and
make
herman
a
part
owner
the
new
factory
be
a
great
success
in
two
year
the
number
of
employee
at
dieomatic
grow
from
ten
to
fifty
because
he
be
a
part
owner
herman
hustle
day
and
night
he
make
the
business
grow
and
the
more
business
he
drum
up
the
more
money
he
make
so
i
take
the
next
foreman
and
do
the
same
thing
and
then
i
take
another
foreman
and
give
him
the
same
deal
and
after
a
while
i
have
a
grow
number
of
factory
and
all
the
manager
at
those
factory
have
a
cut
of
the
business
like
herman
koob
they
be
all
first
rate
operator
nut
and
bolt
guy
who
could
run
the
factory
and
turn
a
profit
make
just
about
any
part
under
the
sun
all
of
a
sudden
there
i
be
a
young
guy
with
a
bunch
of
factory
under
my
belt
and
more
money
than
i
ever
imagine
the
partnership
arrangement
become
the
blueprint
for
magna
s
unique
decentralize
operating
structure
where
each
magna
plant
be
an
independent
business
unit
that
be
run
by
a
hand
on
manager
who
receive
a
portion
of
the
factory
s
profit
we
have
hit
upon
a
win
formula
one
that
harvard
business
school
would
year
later
describe
in
a
case
study
as
magna
s
success
formula
i
have
an
even
simpler
way
to
describe
it
i
call
it
give
everyone
a
piece
of
the
action
seven
year
after
first
arrive
in
canada
i
be
heartsick
for
home
and
need
a
break
in
the
year
since
i
have
left
i
have
sent
my
parent
and
friend
the
odd
postcard
or
letter
but
for
the
most
part
i
be
too
wrap
up
try
to
build
my
small
business
it
be
the
spring
of
and
the
small
tool
and
die
shop
i
start
four
year
earlier
now
have
several
new
factory
and
about
in
annual
sale

day
of
sleep
in
the
factory
and
cooking
meal
on
a
hot
plate
be
over
so
after
work
day
in
and
day
out
for
many
year
i
be
finally
able
to
take
some
time
off
and
return
home
i
trade
in
my
use
chevy
and
bought
my
first
new
car
a
glossy
black
pontiac
parisienne
two
ton
of
chrome
and
metal
with
a
sleek
body
and
tail
light
that
make
the
car
look
like
a
rocket
ship
i
drove
the
car
to
new
york
where
i
board
the
s
s
united
state
and
set
sail
for
northern
france
with
my
car
tucked
away
in
the
belly
of
the
ship
once
i
get
to
france
i
spent
the
next
day
and
a
half
drive
through
the
farmland
field
and
mountain
to
my
hometown
of
weiz
austria
it
be
close
to
midnight
when
i
approach
the
town
where
i
be
born
and
raise
i
be
drive
on
a
gravel
road
in
the
foothill
and
as
i
come
around
a
curve
i
suddenly
saw
the
scatter
light
of
the
town
in
the
valley
below
i
pull
over
get
out
and
lean
against
the
car
the
hood
still
hot
beneath
the
palm
of
my
hand
i
stood
there
for
about
half
an
hour
look
down
into
the
valley
i
do
not
look
back
in
anger
or
resentment
at
the
poverty
and
harshness
of
my
upbringing
i
count
my
many
blessing
and
i
be
deeply
grateful
for
all
of
the
twist
and
turn
that
my
life
have
take
not
know
where
it
would
carry
me
or
what
path
lay
ahead
i
felt
that
i
be
the
lucky
man
in
the
world
in
the
cool
stillness
of
the
night
my
mind
be
flood
with
a
thousand
memory
and
emotion
i
thought
of
my
mother
who
rent
a
small
plot
of
land
and
grow
cucumber
tomato
radish
and
onion
and
then
sell
them
at
the
market
wartime
food
ration
meant
hunger
and
deprivation
for
many
family
on
most
day
she
make
us
porridge
like
cornmeal
for
breakfast
and
cornmeal
for
lunch
sometimes
with
soup
or
a
salad
once
in
a
while
as
a
special
treat
she
would
drizzle
hot
bacon
grease
and
bit
of
bacon
over
top
the
cornmeal
a
dish
i
still
make
myself
today
alone
in
my
kitchen
on
a
rainy
sunday
afternoon
as
a
young
boy
the
only
thing
on
my
mind
be
play
soccer
but
as
i
get
old
my
mother
always
harped
at
me
say
that
i
need
to
learn
a
trade
she
would
give
me
chore
sweep
floor
weed
the
garden
cut
wood
if
i
didn
t
follow
through
she
would
occasionally
whack
me
with
a
carpet
beater
as
i
grow
old
and
strong
i
be
able
to
hold
her
arm
and
stave
off
the
beating
and
i
could
see
her
try
her
hardest
not
to
laugh
she
always
bought
shoe
a
few
size
large
so
they
would
last
longer
and
she
get
upset
at
me
when
i
kick
stone
along
the
road
as
we
walk
into
town
she
would
say
boy
you
have
to
stop
kick
those
stone
you
re
wear
the
shoe
out
i
also
thought
of
my
father
a
muscular
man
with
blondish
brown
hair
he
apprentice
as
a
miller
in
a
flour
mill
and
also
work
as
a
lathe
operator
and
at
countless
other
factory
job
he
be
a
bit
of
a
dreamer
a
bookworm
and
an
idealist
who
believe
in
the
brotherhood
of
man
and
who
rail
against
the
elite
of
the
day
i
could
see
him
sit
beside
the
radio
turn
the
dial
try
to
find
foreign
broadcast
which
be
forbidden
during
the
war
but
what
i
thought
about
most
look
down
into
the
valley
below
be
that
after
all
the
struggle
of
start
my
own
business
and
settle
into
a
new
country
thousand
of
mile
away
after
all
the
long
night
and
weekend
and
sacrifice
i
have
finally
make
it
i
didn
t
have
to
worry
ever
again
about
be
hungry
or
be
fire
or
have
a
roof
over
my
head
all
of
those
fear
and
anxiety
my
parent
grapple
with
when
i
be
grow
up
and
that
i
later
experienced
myself
i
be
a
free
man
it
be
around
midnight
when
i
arrive
at
my
mother
s
home
i
hadn
t
told
her
i
be
come
i
want
to
surprise
her
i
knock
on
the
window
shutter
and
heard
her
ask
who
be
it
i
simply
say
it
s
me
my
mother
immediately
recognize
her
son
s
voice
and
she
let
out
a
long
drawn
out
cry
of
joy
and
surprise
the
next
day
i
hooked
up
with
some
old
friend
and
we
pile
into
my
parisienne
and
drove
around
town
draw
the
wide
eyed
stare
of
local
who
turn
their
head
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
car
as
it
wound
its
way
through
the
narrow
cobblestone
street
i
wasn
t
try
to
show
off
like
some
big
shot
who
have
struck
it
rich
i
knew
my
childhood
buddy
would
get
a
big
kick
out
of
drive
in
the
car
for
me
just
watch
the
look
on
their
face
their
shout
to
the
townsfolk
as
we
pass
by
that
be
sheer
joy
we
all
felt
like
we
have
just
won
the
big
game
and
be
carry
home
the
championship
cup
we
stop
at
local
tavern
and
caf
s
the
way
we
use
to
in
year
go
by
and
we
hoist
celebratory
shot
glass
overflow
with
schnapps
i
caught
up
on
what
everyone
be
do
while
also
share
story
about
my
new
life
in
the
new
world
before
leave
on
my
trip
i
have
seriously
contemplate
come
back
to
austria
permanently
i
have
be
away
for
about
seven
year
but
the
truth
be
when
you
re
homesick
you
often
romanticize
the
past
and
the
place
you
live
once
you
return
once
you
fall
back
into
the
day
to
day
grind
it
s
never
quite
as
rosy
as
you
remember
it
after
a
month
of
vacation
in
austria
i
prepared
to
head
back
to
my
new
home
i
knew
my
mother
s
heart
be
go
to
break
so
i
act
up
and
clown
around
and
on
the
day
i
left
there
be
both
laughter
and
tear
i
say
my
goodbye
get
into
my
parisienne
and
head
back
to
france
for
the
transatlantic
cross
back
to
my
adopt
homeland
toronto
be
where
my
future
lay
the
place
where
i
would
marry
and
raise
a
family
the
place
where
i
would
build
my
business
block
by
block
factory
by
factory
into
one
of
the
world

big
car
part
manufacturer
after
i
return
from

company
continued
to
grow
and
i
held
on
to
my
best
manager
by
give
them
a
share
of
the
profit
and
ownership

same
formula

have
work
out
with
my
first
manager

able
to
run
the
factory
as
their
own
business
and
they
get
a
portion
of
the
profit
while
i
be
able
to
harness
their
entrepreneurial
energy
and
enthusiasm
to
grow
the
company
most
of
the
toolmaker
i
hire
in
those
early
year
be
immigrant

of
them

and
just
like

build
a
well
life
i
put
in
bonus
system
to
keep
my
best
guy
and
to
spur
them
on
when
i
get
a
contract
i
d
say
to
them
if
you
can
do
it
faster
i
ll
give
you
a
cut
if
i
have
a
job
for
a
tool
quote
at
and
the
total
cost
be
that
meant
we
have
in
profit
i
laid
it
all
out
for
them
they
could
see
how
much
money
be
on
the
line
and
exactly
how
much
more
they
could
make
i
never
hid
anything
it
be
all
out
in
the
open
i
say
this
be
what
you
ll
get
and
they
always
come
through
by
this
time
we
be
building
the
tool
and
produce
the
part
back
in
the
early
day
bidding
be
haphazard
today
the
bidding
process
be
very
clinical
and
you
have
to
be
an
approve
supplier
but
back
then
you
might
take
a
buyer
or
owner
out
for
dinner
and
get
your
foot
in
the
door
for
quote
on
job
down
the
road
when
we
do
get
a
quote
it
take
us
about
a
day
to
figure
out
how
to
price
the
tool
and
zero
in
on
the
cost
of
the
material
the
auto
part
business
always
be
and
always
will
be
brutally
competitive
i
could
be
the
cousin
of
henry
ford
and
he
couldn
t
help
me
land
a
contract
if
the
price
and
quality
weren
t
right
cost
be
weigh
and
measure
within
a
fraction
of
a
cent
when
you
re
manufacturing
a
million
piece
half
a
cent
make
the
difference
between
whether
or
not
you
get
the
contract
you
ve
get
to
really
be
on
the
ball
to
survive
in
an
environment
like
that
our
overhead
be
kept
trim
to
the
bone
so
we
always
make
a
profit
later
we
would
bid
on
job
even
if
we
knew
it
meant
a
small
loss
just
to
prove
to
customer
that
we
could
make
a
quality
product
and
once
we
latch
on
to
a
new
product
line
we
rarely
ever
lose

that
be
go
gangbusters
he
could
shore
up
his

and
boost

jack
and
i
hash
out
the
broad
detail
of
a
possible
merger
on
a
ski

one
sunday
afternoon
at
a
resort
north
of
toronto

about
to
million
in

at
the
time
our

be
do
slightly
more
after
a
few
month
of

and
forth
negotiate
we
do
the
deal
i
get

in
cash
and
share
of

it
be
twelve
year
after
i
have
start
my
own
business
and
i
be
a
millionaire
between
burt
pabst
and
me
we
control
about
percent
of
the
company
stock
but
we
be
pretty
green
when
it
come
to
how
public
company
be
run
even
though
our
shareholding
be
substantial
and
even
though
we
both
have
a
seat
on
the
board
we
have
no
say
in
the
direction
of
the
company
the
director
be
only
interested
in
spike
the
stock
price
so
they
kept
push
the
aerospace
side
of
the
business
which
investor
found
allure
aerospace
be
the
hot
technology
stock
of
its
day
but
it
be
a
money
loser
the
way
burt
and
i
saw
it
the
company
be
head
in
the
wrong
direction
everything
i
have
work
to
build
over
the
past
decade
be
go
down
the
drain
because
i
couldn
t
sway
the
board
and
because
i
have
no
real
control
i
decide
to
sell
my
share
i
be
go
to
start
all
over
again
i
told
my
fellow
board
member
my
intention
and
a
number
of
them
ask
if
i
would
sell
my
share
to
them
we
drew
up
a
contract
and
they
issue
a
promissory
note
but
when
the
note
come
due
they
didn
t
have
the
money
i
could
have
try
to
collect
the
money
by
launch
legal
action
but
i
have
never
sue
anybody
in
my
life
besides
the
money
wasn
t
my
real
interest
my
one
and
only
interest
be
run
magna
the
way
i
felt
it
ought
to
be
run
i
have
no
animosity
toward
the
board
member
but
i
told
them
that
in
lieu
of
the
money
they
owe
me
they
would
have
to
resign
from
the
board
from
that
point
forward

when
i
first
start
out
in

i
make
my
top
performer
partner
in
profit
and
i
give
them
a
share
of
the
ownership
eventually
when
my
firm
become
a
publicly
trade
company
i
be
able
to
give
every
employee
the
chance
to
own
a
portion
of
the
company
and
to
share
in

line
if

a
real
and

they
will
be
more
motivate
to
produce
a

product
for
a

chapter
fair
enterprise
give
everyone
a
piece
of
the
action
what
make
people
get
up
in
the
morning
basically
people
want
to
make
a
well
life
for
themselves
and
their
family
a
year
after
my
automotive
part
company
merge
with
magna
electronics
and
we
adopt
the
new
name
magna
international
we
begin
share
profit
and
ownership
with
our
employee
through
a
profit
and
equity
participation
plan
i
have
always
believe
that
a
company
could
be
more
productive
and
more
competitive
if
it
be
able
to
harness
the
drive
force
of
the
business
management
employee
and
investor
and
get
them
to
all
pull
in
the
same
direction
or
to
put
it
another
way
if
you
have
a
wagon
pull
by
three
horse
and
each
of
the
horse
run
off
in
a
different
direction
you
usually
end
up
in
the
ditch
as
magna
continued
to
grow
in
size
i
want
to
entrench
the
company
s
fair
enterprise
operating
philosophy
in
a
formal
document
with
simple
straightforward
principle
something
transparent
and
clearly
spell
out
so
that
everyone
knew
upfront
what
their
share
of
the
profit
be
that
s
when
i
come
up
with
the
idea
of
a
corporate
constitution
it
s
the
cornerstone
of
our
entrepreneurial
culture
and
the
heart
of
the
corporate
constitution
be
a
clear
cut
formula
that
allows
magna
s
key
stakeholder
to
participate
in
the
company
s
growth
and
profitability
i
believe
magna
be
the
only
company
in
the
world
with
such
a
constitution
it
be
an
economic
covenant
or
pact
between
the
company
s
key
stakeholder
employee
management
shareholder
and
society
that
predetermines
the
percentage
of

profit

by
each
group
in
magna
formally
adopt
its
unique
constitution
although
we
have
operate
under
its
core
profit
share
principle
for
a
number
of
year
i
remember
when
we
first
draft
the
constitution
one
of
the
corporate
lawyer
say
to
me
frank
be
you
crazy
why
would
you
put
this
in
write
if
you
didn
t
have
a
constitution
you
could
take
an
even
big
portion
of
the
profit
that
s
precisely
why
the
constitution
be
so
important
because
its
principle
be
strong
than
any
one
person
include
myself

at

this

be
much
more
than

window

or
a

mission
statement
the
foremost
principle
of
the

be
that
we
predetermine
what
we
do
with
our
annual
profit
or
as
i
prefer
to
say
how
we
slice
up
the
pie
here
in
a
nutshell
be
how
it
work
we
can
t
make
a
profit
without
worker
magna
s
employee
design
engineer
and
manufacture
quality
product
at
globally
competitive
price
as
a
result
they
pocket
percent
of
the
company
s
annual
profit
before
tax
in
the
form
of
stock
and
cash
to
determine
each
employee
s
share
of
the
profit
we
use
a
formula
that
reward
loyalty
measure
by
year
of
service
and
performance
capture
by
the
level
of
salary
magna
s
investor
provide
the
capital
need
to
build
new
factory
purchase
new
equipment
and
fund
product
research
so
percent
of
our
profit
go
to
shareholder
in
the
form
of
a
dividend
a
quarterly
cash
payment
tie
to
every
share
own
in
order
to
run
a
successful
business
you
also
need
good
management
that
can
provide
the
strategic
leadership
need
to
guide
long
term
growth
so
senior
management
get
percent
of
the
company
s
annual
profit
before
tax
the
company
must
develop
new
product
and
technology
to
remain
competitive
down
the
road
so
we
plow
percent
of
our
annual
profit
into
r
d
each
year
and
reinvestment
in
the
community
where
magna
operates
make
us
a
value
employer
and
a
good
corporate
citizen
so
percent
of
our
profit
go
to
charity
and
non
profit
group
in
the
community
and

our

live

the
rest

to
share

of

that

the

a
number
of

such
as
the
right
to
approve
significant
investment
in
an

the
only
regret
i
have
regard
the

be
that

didn

i
feel

never
give

we
be
talk
about

thirty
year
before

it
be
and
still
be
a
one
of

which
give

the
opportunity
to
share
in
both
the
profit
and
ownership
of
the
company
our
fair
enterprise
approach
to
do
business
be
pay
off
sale
begin
to
grow
at
a
rapid
pace
climb
more
than
percent
per
year
on
average
magna
have
start
the
decade
with
less
than
million
in
sale
and
several
product
line
by
the
end
of
the
decade
magna
be
make
approximately
different
component
and
have
sale
of
close
to
million
when
the
s
roll
around
sale
and
growth
shot
up
even
high
when
i
start
out
in
business
i
didn
t
have
any
grand
philosophy
i
be
simply
struggle
to
get
the
business
off
the
ground
and
make
enough
money
to
cover
my
operating
and
living
expense
what
i
would
later
label
as
the
fair
enterprise
philosophy
evolve
naturally
from
the
way
my
business
grow
such
as
my
make
herman
koob
a
partner
i
have
no
financial
study
or
spreadsheet
i
just
knew
in
my
gut
that
if
you
give
everyone
a
cut
of
the
action
your
business
would
grow
and
make
more
money
i
want
manager
and
worker
to
get
a
portion
of
the
profit
and
become
part
owner
there
s
nothing
like
ownership
to
instill
pride
and
create
drive
and
hustle
it
s
just
common
sense
when
you
own
a
piece
of
the
machine
you
re
work
on
and
you
get
a
slice
of
the
profit
you
help
produce
you
care
more
you
work
harder
think
about
it
this
way
if
you
rent
an
apartment
it
s
not
the
same
as
own
a
house
if
you
invest
your
own
money
in
buying
a
house
no
matter
how
small
you
will
take
great
care
of
it
you
will
paint
the
trim
sweep
the
sidewalk
and
tend
the
garden
it
s
amaze
what
ownership
do
to
people
when
people
own
thing
their
mentality
change
they
acquire
a
whole
new
outlook
and
because
of
fair
enterprise
i
believe
that
magna
be
much
more
than
a
company
it
be
a
whole
new
economic
culture
something
i
describe
as
an
organic
industrial
genetic
formula
for
growth
when
an
acorn
fall
from
an
oak
tree
the
new
oak
tree
that
spring
up
carry
the
same
genetic
blueprint
the
same
principle
hold
true
at
magna
every
single
one
of
our
factory
be
an
independent
profit
centre
capable
of
reproduce
itself
many
time
over
much
as
a
cell
replicates
itself
by
subdivide
over
and
over
again
magna
s
factory
or
division
be
run
by
entrepreneurial
hand
on
manager
when
one
of
these
manager
start
a
new
division
with
a
new
product
it
split
off
from
the
original
factory
and
the
manager
get
a
cut
of
the
profit
from
both
factory
and
the
same
process
can
repeat
itself
many
time
over
until
there
be
enough
factory
to
form
a
new
magna
group
specialize
in
a
new
product
line
the
general
manager
of
a
magna
factory
always
have
an
assistant
general
manager
someone
who
s
a
strong
operator
a
real
up
and
comer
the
formula
we
establish
early
on
be
that
the
general
manager
get
percent
of
the
factory
s
profit
while
the
assistant
get
percent
but
if
the
general
manager
want
to
grow
and
earn
more
he
have
to
go
out
and
open
a
new
factory
and
when
he
do
that
the
assistant
becomes
the
general
manager
and
get
percent
of
the
profit
while
the
former
general
manager
still
get
percent
at
the
original
factory
he
use
to
run
plus
percent
at
the
new
factory
he
start
if
a
general
manager
be
a
really
good
operator
with
a
knack
for
make
profitable
product
he
can
over
time
develop
his
own
product
group

easy
for
us
to
recognize
and
reward
the
contribution
of
individual

we
re
so
decentralize
in
fact
that
we
have
no
central
purchasing
department
instead
we
have
a
head

team
that
coordinate
and
negotiates

base
on
the
potential
volume
of

s
worldwide
factory
they
then
make
those
high
volume
discount
available
to
our
factory
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
s
up
to
the
manager
whether
or
not
they
buy
from
one
of

s
prefer
supplier
and
that
hold
true
for
everything
from
steel

to
work
glove
and
paper
clip
if
head
office
told
the

you
gotta
buy
from
this
guy
then
a
manager
might
say
the
price
be
good
but
the
quality
wasn
t
up
to
scratch
or
he
might
say
the
price
and
quality
be
on
the
mark
but
the
material
wasn
t
ship
on

in

word
the

could
always
pin
the

on

but
it
s
the
manager
who
be
ultimately
responsible
it
s
an
ironclad
principle
at
magna
the
manager
not
head

call
the
shot
and
they
run
the
division
as
if
they

their
own

competition
be
another
deeply
held
principle
at
magna
our
division
be
so
decentralize
and
independent
that
they
even
compete
against
each
other
for
example
back
in
the
early
s
we
have
one
division
that
make
run
board
for
truck
traditionally
this
be
a
metal
stamp
component
but
one
of
our
plastic
division
begin
experiment
and
come
up
with
a
lighter
weight
plastic
run
board
that
be
strong
and
cheaper
they
capture
the
business
from
the
other
magna
division
evolution
and
change
be
inevitable
and
relentless
just
as
the
small
stainless
steel
piece
we
make
in
magna
s
early
year
give
way
to
aluminum
trim
and
then
plastic
part
technological
innovation
force
us
to
continually
change
i
always
encourage
our
people
to
be
at
the
forefront
of
change
rather
than
play
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
the
industry
but
when
push
come
to
shove
i
would
sooner
lose
business
to
one
of
our
own
product
group
than
to
an
outside
competitor
we
place
all
of
the
day
to
day
operating
decision
in
the
hand
of
our
manager
but
make
them
responsible
for
ensure
profitability
achieve
customer
satisfaction
by
shipping
quality
product
on
time
and
uphold
principle
such
as
fair
treatment
and
a
safe
workplace
when
i
use
to
meet
with
the
manager
i
would
describe
their
responsibility
in
plain
language
that
they
all
could
understand
don
t
screw
the
employee
don
t
screw
the
shareholder
and
if
you
don
t
look
after
your
customer
you
get
no
business
we
also
tie
the
pay
of
our
manager
to
the
performance
of
their
factory
which
we
monitor
on
an
ongoing
basis
because
each
factory
be
a
separate
profit
centre
if
one
start
to
lose
money
it
light
up
like
a
christmas
tree
and
we
take
action
to
get
it
back
on
a
path
of
profitability
and
because
compensation
for
plant
manager
be
base
on
the
profitability
of
their
plant
they
have
to
hustle
day
in
and
day
out
they
re
always
under
the
gun
from
the
constant
pressure
and
need
of
employee
customer
and
supplier
so
we
need
to
have
first
rate
incentive
to
attract
and
reward
good
manager
the
need
for
top
notch
operator
with
hand
on
experience
remains
the
great
challenge
our
company
face
as
it
continue
to
grow
at
magna
over
the
year
we
ve
always
strive
to
grow
our
business
mostly
organically
but
also
through
acquisition
from
time
to
time
however
some
of
our
division
falter
and
lose
money
when
that
happens
we
use
our
human
capital
the
managerial
technical
and
hr
expertise
at
our
disposal
to
help
bring
the
division
back
into
the
black
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
re
builder
not
undertaker
at
any
give
time
there
be
always
some
magna
division
not
make
a
profit
when
it
come
to
new
factory
it
usually
take
time
for
a
start
up
to
begin
make
money
many
of
our
most
profitable
division
make
very
little
money
or
even
lose
money
when
they
first
open
other
division
may
be
face
any
number
of
problem
include
a
bad
manager
technical
difficulty
or
increase
competition
the
easy
thing
to
do
would
be
to
shut
down
the
division
that
be
lose
money
but
that
wouldn
t
be
the
right
thing
to
do
we
ve
never
be
quick
to
pull
the
trigger
on
struggle
division
instead
we
ve
always
regard
the
magna
group
of
company
as
a
family
and
in
a
family
you
always
look
out
for
one
another
so
we
consider
it
our
duty
to
look
after
division
that
occasionally
ran
into
problem
in
other
word
we
stood
by
our
factory
in
the
good
time
and
the
bad
we
prefer
to
seek
a
solution
in
order
to
preserve
job
for
employee
and
that
require
time
and
patience
ultimately
we
be
much
strong
by
stick
together
and
through
this
approach
we
ve
nurse
back
to
health
many
division
that
be
today
generate
profit
and
employ
hundred
of
people
sometimes
as
management
you
have
no
choice
a
factory
might
have
a
product
line
that
have
run
its
course
or
it
might
have
supply
a
nearby
customer
that
close
up
shop
and
move
to
another
location
or
go
out
of
business
but
we
at
all
time
try
to
avoid
closing
factory
and
even
when
we
do
we
make
every
effort
to
relocate
our
employee
elsewhere
our
fair
enterprise
philosophy
be
why
we
ve
grown
at
a
tremendous
rate
over
the
past
fifty
year
and
because
of
our
entrepreneurial
corporate
culture
there
be
no
reason
why
we
cannot
continue
multiply
and
multiply
for
many
decade
to
come
there
be
literally
no
limit
to
how
big
we
can
become
in
we
celebrate
magna
s
fiftieth
anniversary
in
business
and
take
some
time
to
reflect
on
the
many
milestone
and
memorable
achievement
over
the
year
despite
the
significant
innovation
and
technological
breakthrough

have
change

despite
the
year
of
record

our
expansion
into
many
new

the
one
accomplishment
that
stood
out
for
me
more
than
any
other
be
this
from
the

it
be
during
this
period
that
we
launch

that

eventually
see
us
produce

to
sink

want
to
set
up

smack
in
the
middle
of
motown
and
lock

with

the
first
plant
we
open
in
iowa
be
in
the
town
of
montezuma
surround
by
lake
and
corn
field
in
the
heart
of
the
state
the
small
town
in
iowa
remind
me
of
the
small
town
north
of
toronto
where
our
original
factory
be
built
by
the
end
of
the
decade
we
have
a
total
of
five
division
in
iowa
one
of
the
main
reason
for
our
growth
during
that
decade
be
that
we
be
gain
a
hard
won
identity
among
the
north
american
automaker
as
a
go
to
problem
solver
we
have
also
developed
a
great
reputation
for
customer
service
when
the
car
company
say
jump
we
didn
t
ask
any
question
we
only
respond
how
high
by
the
world
be
in
the
grip
of
an
oil
crisis
that
drove
up
the
price
of
fuel
and
high
fuel
price
force
automaker
to
find
way
of
reduce
overall
vehicle
weight
in
order
to
achieve
well
gas
mileage
one
of
the
easy
and
most
effective
way
of
do
this
be
by
switch
from
steel
to
plastic
bumper
the
crisis
open
a
door
for
us
and
we
could
see
that
the
industry
be
move
more
and
more
toward
plastic
component
in
the
late
s
we
acquire
some
r
d
technology
from
uniroyal
the
company
have
be
work
with
polyurethane
a
material
that
be
pliable
and
could
be
easily
mould
and
we
begin
experiment
with
it
the
result
of
that
experimentation
be
magna
s
breakthrough
reaction
injection
mould
rim
process
the
new
technology
lead
to
the
establishment
of
polyrim
our
first
plastic
bumper
operation
locate
several
mile
down
the
road
from
our
family
farm
a
few
year
later
magna
s
rim
plastic
bumper
appear
on
chrysler
s
famous
k
car
platform
the
vehicle
credit
with
bring
chrysler
back
from
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
it
be
the
start
of
magna
s
rapid
climb
to
become
the
world
s
number
one
supplier
of
plastic
bumper
by
the
s
we
be
pump
out
million
of
bumper
per
year
once
the
japanese
automaker
start
grab
market
share
the
big
three
look
at
what
they
could
do
to
bring
down
cost
and
one
of
the
route
they
decide
to
take
be
to
farm
out
more
production
it
be
an
industry
shift
that
be
tailor
make
for
magna
then
in
after
several
year
of
r
d
work
we
hit
on
something
that
really
make
the
big
three
sit
up
and
take
notice
we
pioneer
the
single
belt
or
serpentine
accessory
drive
system
a
game
changer
in
term
of
automotive
technology
our
guy
take
all
of
the
small
belt
mount
on
the
front
of
the
engine
belt
that
be
use
to
drive
the
alternator
the
water
pump
and
the
air
conditioner
and
they
create
one
long
belt
that
snake
its
way
over
top
of
all
of
the
pulley
the
single
belt
accessory
drive
system
require
less
space
than
the
traditional
multiple
belt
system
and
be
ideally
suit
to
the
trend
at
that
time
toward
small
car
the
magna
single
belt
system
also
offer
improve
engine
efficiency
at
a
low
unit
cost
a
perfect
example
of
the
make
a
well
product
for
a
well
price
formula
that
would
win
magna
a
big
and
big
slice
of
the
auto
part
market
in
the
decade
ahead
a
few
year
later
we
come
up
with
a
revolutionary
automatic
belt
tensioning
device
design
to
constantly
tighten
the
belt
which
lengthens
and
loosens
over
time
we
weren
t
just
make
part
anymore
we
be
change
the
way
car
be
make
automaker
begin
outsource
more
and
more
component
to
automotive
supplier
part
that
we
previously
could
never
bid
on
because
the
carmaker
manufacture
them
in
house
these
part
include
for
the
first
time
component
such
as
door
latch
that
require
a
much
high
level
of
engineering
and
technical
expertise
the
sort
of
stuff
that
simple
metal
bashers
couldn
t
make
in
magna
open
ktm
lock
our
first
door
latch
manufacturing
operation
three
year
later
we
go
from
be
the
new
kid
on
the
block
to
become
one
of
the
large
supplier
of
door
hinge
and
door
latch
to
the
north
american
car
industry
it
be
around
this
time
that
we
start
to
grasp
our
full
potential
we
could
make
just
about
any
gear
or
gizmo
under
the
hood
and
more
time
than
not
we
could
do
it
well
and
cheaper
than
anyone
else
make
a
well
product
if
you
re
think
about
start
your
own
business
consider
your
personal
experience
as
a
customer
from
time
to
time
we
have
all
experienced
the
disappointment
that
come
with
buying
a
bad
product
or
get
poor
service
try
to
zero
in
on
a
business
where
you
think
you
can
make
a
well
product
or
provide
well
service
and
then
focus
on
that
do
some
research
and
spend
a
few
year
work
in
that
business
or
industry
to
learn
all
of
the
in
and
out
chapter
the
pursuit
of
economic
freedom
human
charter
of
right
alone
be
not
sufficient
they
have
to
be
fortify
with
economic
charter
of
right
economic
charter
of
right
will
lead
to
economic
democracy
and
economic
democracy
be
the
basis
for
democracy
itself
my
first
up
close
look
at
the
fanatical
face
of
totalitarianism
come
after
the
nazi
annexed
austria
they
introduce
into
the
school
mandatory
drill
march
and
other
show
of
allegiance
to
the
state
one
time
when
my
class
be
force
to
do
some
drill
i
ducked
away
and
climbed
a
nearby
cherry
tree
where
i
remain
safe
and
out
of
sight
i
be
when
the
second
world
war
come
to
an
end
the
nazi
who
have
occupy
and
control
austria
be
in
disarray
and
retreat
the
front
line
of
the
russian
invasion
be
only
three
or
four
mile
from
my
house
i
could
hear
artillery
and
gunfire
day
and
night
for
nearly
a
month
everyone
could
sense
the
end
be
come
we
be
hop
the
english
and
american
would
arrive
before
the
russian
but
it
wasn
t
to
be
the
russian
become
our
new
occupier
and
for
the
next
six
month
they
rule
the
portion
of
austria
where
we
live
so
within
the
span
of
several
year
i
live
under
the
two
most
severe
and
repressive
political
system
of
the
twentieth
century
nazism
and
soviet
communism
what
these
totalitarian
system
share
in
common
be
a
boot
on
the
throat
of
free
expression
and
individual
right
under
both
system
the
individual
be
subservient
to
the
state
and
although
i
be
still
very
young
i
could
see
that
they
be
incompatible
with
the
human
urge
to
be
free
i
believe
people
everywhere
have
two
basic
desire
first
they
crave
personal
freedom
which
essentially
mean
they
want
the
right
to
choose
their
own
road
to
happiness
and
second
they
want
economic
freedom
which
mean
they
want
to
be
financially
independent
the
reality
be
that
people
be
not
truly
free
unless
they
have
economic
freedom
personal
freedom
may
not
mean
much
to
an
inner
city
kid
in
detroit
or
a
single
mother
in
harlem
for
instance
it
just
mean
they
re
free
to
be
hungry
and
free
to
be
poor
even
though
many
people
in
the
west
live
in
highly
advanced
and
prosperous
society
only
perhaps
percent
of
the
population
can
be
consider
economically
free
and
yet
what
fuel
me
as
a
young
man
be
the
desire
to
attain
economic
freedom
it
be
my
fire
in
the
belly
my
key
motivation
in
work
as
hard
as
i
do
to
build
magna
society
in
the
west
have
focus
on
create
great
charter
of
human
right
and
freedom
and
these
right
and
freedom
should
always
be
safeguard
they
have
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
development
of
prosperous
democratic
society
but
at
the
same
time
i
find
it
incomprehensible
that
we
as
a
society
do
not
place
a
great
emphasis
on
how
people
can
achieve
economic
freedom
economic
freedom
have
different
meaning
in
different
part
of
the
world
here
in
the
west
economic
freedom
would
entail
accumulate
a
sufficient
amount
of
wealth
after
have
work
for
twenty
or
so
year
that
you
could
own
a
modest
home
and
have
enough
money
in
the
bank
that
you
could
stop
work
and
live
off
the
interest
on
your
saving
you
would
be
free
to
paint
or
travel
or
pursue
other
hobby
and
passion
yet
so
very
few
of
us
be
able
to
do
that
why
society
throughout
the
age
have
developed
various
economic
system
everything
from
colonial
imperialism
to
free
market
trading
as
a
way
to
generate
the
great
amount
of
wealth
possible
in
the
past
century
alone
our
world
have
be
govern
by
three
main
socio
economic
system
all
of
which
still
exist
in
one
form
or
another
totalitarianism
state
enterprise
or
socialism
and
free
enterprise
each
of
these
system
have
a
major
flaw
under
a
totalitarian
economic
system
human
right
be
trample
and
economic
development
be
direct
by
military
force
with
the
result
that
economic
benefit
be
share
by
relatively
few
people
under
the
state
enterprise
socialist
system
the
little
wealth
that
be
produce
be
distribute
by
state
bureaucrat
which
eventually
lead
to
an
enormous
build
up
of
bureaucracy
the
problem
with
the
free
enterprise
system
be
that
although
it
be
extremely
efficient
at
create
wealth
greed
be
not
curtail
and
as
a
result
more
and
more
capital
becomes
concentrate
in
the
hand
of
few
and
few
people
what
s
more
the
democratic
system
within
a
free
enterprise
society
be
vote
driven
in
practical
term
this
mean
that
political
party
cater
to
the
mass
by
introduce
wealth
redistribution
measure
and
socialistic
program
the
inevitable
result
be
that
the
free
enterprise
system
get
slowly
pull
toward
the
state
enterprise
socialist
economic
system
where
the
state
take
and
distributes
a
large
and
large
portion
of
the
wealth
i
believe
that
we
must
do
everything
possible
to
preserve
the
free
enterprise
system
without
free
enterprise
there
be
no
free
society
yet
i
also
realize
that
from
time
to
time
the
free
enterprise
system
can
be
self
destructive
especially
when
it
be
in
the
grip
of
unbridled
greed
the
financial
meltdown
trigger
by
wall
street
in
be
an
unforgettable
example
the
real
dilemma
confront
all
three
system
be
the
creation
of
wealth
and
its
distribution
the
state
enterprise
socialist
system
be
effective
at
distribute
wealth
but
it
stifle
productivity
and
wealth
creation
free
enterprise
on
the
other
hand
be
effective
at
create
wealth
but
the
concentration
of
capital
in
the
hand
of
relatively
few
people
lead
to
increase
taxation
and
social
program
design
to
redistribute
wealth
on
a
more
even
basis
what
we
see
in
europe
today
and
increasingly
in
north
america
we
have
become
so
absorbed
with
distribute
wealth
that
we
have
neglect
ensure
that
we
have
the
right
environment
to
create

there
be
another
option
it
s
the
system
we
practice
at
magna
call
fair

it
s
an
economic
philosophy

system
that
recognizes
that
a
successful
business
be
driven
by
three
force
manager

and
that
all

when
they

they

something
at

then
they
work
harder
and
think
smarter
and
that
make
a
business
faster
strong
more
competitive
the
state
doesn
t
have
the
right
to
tell
a
business
what
it
should
do
with
its

at
the
point
of
a
gun
totalitarian
system
inevitably
fail
because
they
be
incompatible
with
the
human
spirit
and
they
attempt
to
suppress
the
human
desire
for
personal
and
economic
freedom
make
the
individual
subservient
to
the
state
the
state
enterprise
or
socialist
system
be
base
on
the
philosophy
that
wealth
should
be
redistribute
so
that
there
be
not
great
difference
in
income
level
consequently
there
be
not
enough
incentive
for
individual
to
create
more
wealth
by
work
harder
and
by
be
more
innovative
and
productive
the
little
wealth
that
be
create
be
distribute
by
state
bureaucrat
and
the
harder
bureaucrat
work
the
more
bureaucrat
they
create
this
lead
to
an
enormous
build
up
of
bureaucracy
which
in
turn
choke
the
productive
juice
of
society
and
stifle
individual
ingenuity
and
innovation
state
enterprise
also
result
in
the
collectivization
of
individual
and
more
and
more
people
become
dependent
on
the
state
for
their
existence
history
have
proven
that
state
enterprise
system
always
fail
lead
to
great
poverty
and
low
living
standard
create
the
foundation
of
a
free
society
free
enterprise
be
extremely
effective
at
create
wealth
but
its
major
flaw
be
that
more
and
more
capital
end
up
be
held
by
few
and
few
people
this
in
turn
lead
to
more
state
intervention
and
call
for
great
redistribution
of
wealth
the
free
enterprise
system
be
base
on
a
democratic
charter
of
right
and
freedom
which
guarantee
among
other
thing
the
right
to
vote
this
mean
that
the
system
be
constituency
driven
if
politician
don
t
cater
to
the
mass
they
won
t
get
elect
as
a
result
politician
promise
more
and
more
socialistic
economic
program
in
order
to
win
elect
office
the
free
enterprise
system
therefore
get
pull
toward
state
enterprise
in
order
for
free
enterprise
to
avoid
be
absorbed
by
state
enterprise
business
must
create
more
capitalist
by
share
profit
and
equity
with
worker
so
they
can
accumulate
capital
create
capitalist
out
of
worker
the
fair
enterprise
system
be
an
alternative
to
the
state
enterprise
and
free
enterprise
system
its
philosophy
be
base
upon
the
principle
that
people
desire
economic
freedom
as
well
as
individual
freedom
via
tax
incentive
however
business
can
be
encourage
to
adopt
an
economic
charter
of
right
which
give
worker
the
right
to
participate
in
capital
building
economic
charter
of
right
will
lead
to
economic
democracy
and
economic
democracy
be
the
basis
for
democracy
itself
the
fair
enterprise
system
be
design
to
generate
great
wealth
and
then
distribute
that
wealth
in
a
way
that
be
much
fairer
and
more
broadly
base
than
any
other
system
the
creation
and
distribution
of
wealth
be
at
the
crux
of
any
economic
system
and
every
economic
system
must
answer
two
fundamental
question
how
do
you
create
wealth
and
who
get
the
wealth
fair
enterprise
recognizes
that
if
you
don
t
create
wealth
in
the
first
place
there
s
nothing
to
distribute
it
far
recognizes
that
the
people
who
create
wealth
should
all
get
a
fair
share
of
that
wealth
rather
than
pit
worker
against
capitalist
fair
enterprise
turn
worker
into
capitalist
the
fair
enterprise
system
be
a
safety
valve
or
buffer
design
to
prevent
free
enterprise
from
be
drag
toward
state
enterprise
unfortunately
the
history
of
mankind
have
always
be
and
still
be
dominate
by
the
golden
rule
the
man
who
have
the
gold
make
the
rule
century
ago
you
knew
who
the
guy
with
the
gold
be
it
be
the
king
up
on
the
hill
in
his
castle
but
today
no
one
know
who
the
king
be
they
live
in
penthouse
condominium
in
manhattan
and
beach
home
in
malibu
and
these
king
own
most
of
the
world
s
wealth
at
a
time
when
the
gap
between
the
rich
and
the
low
and
middle
class
be
grow
large
and
large
i
would
never
want
anyone
to
dominate
me
or
my
child
and
if
i
feel
that
strongly
then
i
should
never
expect
to
be
able
to
dominate
anyone
else
so
the
challenge
we
as
a
society
face
be
this
we
must
find
a
way
to
dismantle
the
chain
of
domination
not
via
a
destructive
revolution
but
via
a
revolution
of
the
mind
we
ve
built
great
political
democracy
but
we
still
haven
t
attain
economic
democracy
and
this
fact
go
to
the
heart
of
what
fair
enterprise
be
all
about
the
core
philosophy
behind
fair
enterprise
be
that
our
human
charter
of
right
need
to
be
augment
and
fortify
with
economic
charter
of
right
include
the
right
of
worker
to
accumulate
wealth
through
equity
and
profit
participation
economic
charter
of
right
will
lay
the
foundation
for
economic
democracy
and
economic
democracy
be
the
basis
for
democracy
itself
in
a
fair
enterprise
system
a
business
would
have
an
economic
charter
of
right
its
employee
would
get
a
portion
of
the
profit
and
ownership
in
the
company
and
most
of
the
company
s
profit
would
be
reinvested
in
the
country
if
business
operating
under
fair
enterprise
principle
paid
a
low
tax
rate
more
business
would
adopt
these
principle
and
more
employee
would
begin
to
reap
the
benefit
of
have
a
financial
stake
in
their
place
of
employment
business
meanwhile
would
become
more
competitive
a
country
adopt
such
a
system
would
see
an
increase
in
productivity
and
a
much
fairer
and
broader
base
distribution
of
wealth
than
any
system
that
have
previously
exist
in
short
the
country
would
blossom
economically
i
truly
believe
that
fair
enterprise
more
than
any
other
system
would
give
the
great
number
of
citizen
the
opportunity
to
achieve
economic
freedom
one
of
the
great
longing
of
individual
everywhere
fair
enterprise
work
for
my
company
it
can
work
for
your
company
too
and
if
more
and
more
company
adopt
it
i
believe
it
could
work
for
entire
country
ignite
economic
growth
and
development
on
a
scale

before

your
word

you
make
a
commitment
make
sure
you
can
live
up
to
it
when
you
re
a
manager
you
have
to
work
hard
to
win
the
trust
and
respect
of
your
employee
you
can
always
find
new
business
if
you
lose
a
customer
but
if
you
tarnish
your
reputation
it
be
very
difficult
to
regain
and
when
it
come
to
trust
there
be
no
shortcut
or
detour
once
you
ve
lose
that
trust
you
can
never
get
it
back
a
capitalist
be
an
individual
who
work
hard
to
accumulate
enough

to
become

who
want

let
me
tell
you
in
my
experience
it
s
a
lot
easy
to
be
happy
if

have
some
money
my
first
horse
be
not
much
to
look
at
a
bony
old
grey
mare
that
a
russian
soldier
give
me
i
be
year
old
and
russian
soldier
be
pour
into
the
foothill
of
the
austrian
alp
during
the
die
day
of
the
second
world
war
like
many
of
the
boy
in
town
i
go
into
the
street
to
watch
the
soldier
truck
and
tank
come
into
our
village
there
be
story
go
around
that
some
woman
have
be
rap
so
earlier
that
morning
my
mother
take
a
pair
of
scissors
and
chopped
off
my
sister
elizabeth
s
hair
and
dress
her
in
a
pair
of
pant
to
make
her
look
like
a
boy
and
although
my
mother
warn
me
to
stay
out
of
sight
my
curiosity
get
the
well
of
me
later
in
the
day
i
be
stand
by
a
broken
down
army
truck
that
have
be
abandon
at
the
side
of
the
road
when
a
russian
soldier
rode
by
on
horseback
while
another
solider
walk
behind
him
on
foot
he
get
off
the
horse
and
immediately
go
to
work
try
to
fix
the
truck
once
he
get
the
engine
start
he
start
laugh
and
shout
but
before
take
off
he
hand
me
the
rein
of
his
horse
there
i
be
just
a
barefoot
schoolboy
the
proud
owner
of
my
own
horse
i
knew
a
farm
nearby
that
have
an
abandon
shed
and
i
brought
her
over
and
set
her
up
in
a
makeshift
stall
the
next
morning
i
bolt
out
of
bed
and
ran
over
to
the
shed
to
see
my
horse
i
pet
her
talk
to
her
and
fed
her
from
my
hand
a
day
later
i
arrive
at
the
shed
early
in
the
morning
and
found
the
door
open
and
the
stall
empty
my
heart
sank
i
want
to
believe
that
she
have
run
away
but
as
the
war
drag
on
food
be
become
scarcer
and
my
horse
have
probably
be
take
away
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
butcher
i
m
a
great
believer
that
experience
in
life
help
shape
our
character
and
our
destiny
they
be
the
ingredient
that
make
us
who
we
be
that
brief
experience
with
the
horse
ignite
in
me
a
passion
that
remains
to
this
day
horse
be
such
noble
creature
they
re
elegant
and
beautiful
but
at
the
same
time
they
also
have
an
incredible
primitive
power
stamen
and
courage
they
ve
played
a
great
role
in
the
civilization
of
mankind
from
farm
and
warfare
to
opening
up
new
continent
if
there
be
no
horse
in
the
world
there
would
definitely
be
something
miss
horse
be
also
a
great
equalizer
for
me
they
provide
a
counterbalance
to
the
mechanize
and
industrialize
world
of
automotive
manufacturing
where
metal
gear
and
plastic
part
can
be
weigh
and
measure
and
calibrate
you
can
figure
out
exactly
what
you
re
deal
with
right
down
to
a
fraction
of
a
millimetre
if
something
s
not
right
on
the
production
line
you
can
always
stop
the
machine
and
reconfigure
them
in
business
it
s
beneficial
to
have
an
activity
that
provide
a
counterbalance
a
release
from
the
sometimes
intense
and
grind
pressure
of
meeting
deadline
do
deal
and
pore
over
financial
detail
horse
provide
that
outlet
for
me
they
re
natural
organic
wild
as
unpredictable
and
complex
as
human
you
have
to
get
to
know
them
get
close
to
them
read
their
character
sense
their
mood
and
develop
a
feel
for
their
personality
on
any
give
day
a
horse
might
be
anxious
or
playful
fearful
or
curious
but
that
very
unpredictability
be
what
make
horse
so
exhilarate
one
of
the
place
i
thoroughly
enjoy
be
my
horse
farm
in
bourbon
county
kentucky
it
s
true
bluegrass
country
know
the
world
over
for
its
stud
farm
and
its
whisky
my
prefer
time
of
year
to
go
there
be
spring
it
s
lush
and
green
with
roll
field
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
in
the
cool
early
hour
of
the
morning
when
the
sun
be
come
up
and
the
fog
be
still
hang
over
the
blue
tint
grass
it
have
an
almost
mystical
feel
spending
a
few
day
there
watch
the
stallion
race
through
the
field
recharges
my
mind
and
my
body
and
i
always
leave
my
kentucky
farm
feel
completely
reinvigorate
i
bought
my
first
horse
in
not
long
after
my
business
begin
to
take
off
it
be
a
rid
horse
name
tanjo
and
i
paid
around
buck
for
him
i
have
him
stable
at
a
farm
in
richmond
hill
north
of
toronto
close
to
the
first
factory
we
built
after
outgrow
the
old
gatehouse
where
i
start
magna
during
those
early
year
i
work
so
many
hour
that
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
horse
and
be
able
to
ride
out
into
the
sunset
like
gary
cooper
in
some
old
western
movie
a
few
year
later
i
bought
a
acre
farm
in
a
small
country
town
and
i
built
a
barn
for
our
horse
myself
saw
the
barn
board
by
hand
and
put
up
the
fence
after
work
during
the
long
hot
evening
of
summer
i
would
often
ride
my
horse
through
the
field
with
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
tree
exactly
how
i
always
imagine

the
most
electrify
sport
event
you
can
watch
horse
race
may
be
my
labour
of
love
but
it
s
also
a
tough
sometimes
cutthroat
business
that
demand
as
much
skill
and
savvy
as
any
other
financial
enterprise
no
one
can
say
i
haven
t
paid
my
due
during
the
nearly
fifty
year
i
ve
be
in
the
horse
race
business
i
ve
mucked
out
stall
and
help
birth
many
a
foal
i
can
run
my
hand
down
a
horse
s
knee
or
ankle
and
know
right
away
if
it
s
be
shod
right
in
my
earlier
year
i
spent
many
night
in
the
brood
mare
barn
wait
for
the
brood
mare
to
foal
or
give
birth
to
her
young
i
can
tell
you
what
type
of
grain
or
grass
my
horse
be
fed
and
even
where
they
be
grown
there
be
no
aspect
of
the
business
that
i
consider
too
trivial
to
manage
or
oversee
most
time
at
the
track
you
re
more
likely
to
find
me
talk
to
a
trainer
or
a
horse
groom
than
drinking
a
chardonnay
up
in
the
ritzy
turf
club
it
s
really
no
different
from
any
other
business
you
start
at
the
bottom
and
you
learn
the
inner
working
over
time
even
though
i
ve
climbed
my
way
to
the
top
of
the
industry
and
become
one
of
the
world
s
lead
owner
and
breeder
in
my
mind
i
will
always
be
a
horseman
first
and
foremost
horse
race
and
breeding
have
always
be
a
family
affair
in
our
household
and
it
have
brought
us
a
lot
of
enjoyment
over
the
year
a
lot
of
time
share
together
my
wife
elfriede
have
a
hand
in
virtually
all
aspect
of
the
business
and
often
accompanies
me
to
the
winner
s
circle
after
one
of
our
horse
finish
first
as
the
linchpin
who
hold
our
family
together
she
not
only
have
rock
solid
common
sense
but
she
also
have
great
horse
sense
my
son
andy
be
a
wizard
when
it
come
to
bloodline
and
pedigree
he
selects
the
yearling
and
the
brood
mare
and
basically
match
up
the
horse
that
will
give
us
the
best
chance
of
sire
a
champion
but
breeding
be
not
an
exact
science
there
s
a
lot
of
gut
instinct
involve
when
andy
be
a
kid
he
would
hot
walk
the
horse
early
in
the
morning
after
their
workout
the
horse
have
to
be
cool
down
and
he
would
take
them
by
the
harness
and
walk
them
around
the
barn
while
walk
the
stallion
and
filly
he
would
talk
to
the
people
who
work
with
the
horse
so
he
get
a
real
feel
for
the
business
from
the
ground
up
he
would
read
pedigree
of
horse
the
way
some
boy
study
the
score
statistic
of
their
favourite
hockey
or
baseball
player
today
andy
can
trace
a
horse
s
bloodline
back
six
generation
and
he
can
do
that
off
the
top
of
his
head
with
probably
a
few
thousand
horse
our
family

good
fortune
to

to
the

queen
elizabeth
ii
herself
present
me
with
the
gold
trophy
i
knew
there
be
a
possibility
that
i
would
greet
the
queen
in
person
so
i
ask
bill
davis
a
former
ontario
premier
and
one
of
magna
s
director
for
some
pointer
on
how
to
behave
in
the
company
of
a
monarch
when
bill
finish
i
say
so
i
shouldn
t
give
her
a
tap
on
the
bum
he
turn
white
and
say
be
you
crazy
a
number
of
year
later
the
queen
visit
me
at
my
farm
in
kentucky
when
she
arrive
she
get
out
of
her
car
extend
a
hand
and
say
it
s
very
nice
to
see
you
again
we
spent
half
an
hour
together
i
show
her
my
stallion
and
we
have
a
long
and
detailed
discussion
about
our
share
interest
in
thoroughbred
bloodline
as
it
turn
out
my
stable
end
up
mating
one
of
our
promising
mare
with
one
of
the
royal
stud
the
superb
english
stallion
motivator
when
she
left
i
wish
her
majesty
well
she
s
get
incredible
horse
sense
and
she
s
a
great
and
gracious
lady
awesome
again
ran
in
a
lot
of
tough
race
and
never
lose
once
during
that
entire
year
from
the
moment
i
saw
him
and
give
him
his
name
i
felt
he
have
greatness
in
him
around
the
time
that
awesome
again
be
born
magna
have
gotten
back
on
its
foot
after
a
brush
with
bankruptcy
and
be
start
to
make
tremendous
stride
the
company
be
set
new
sale
record
and
expand
rapidly
into
europe
magna
have
become
awesome
again
and
so
in
hindsight
it
be
fitting
that
i
have
give
that
name
to
a
horse
that
have
all
the
marking
of
a
great
champion
one
of
our
best
horse
over
the
last
few
year
perhaps
our
great
horse
ever
in
term
of
pure
talent
and
power
be
ghostzapper
the
son
of
awesome
again
he
go
undefeated
in
and
again
in
and
like
his
dad
he
won
the
breeder
cup
classic
after
he
won
the
race
a
number
of
reporter
ask
me
about
the
meaning
behind
his
name
i
knew
the
cup
classic
be
go
to
take
place
close
to
halloween
and
it
get
me
think
about
ghost
so
ghostzapper
struck
me
as
a
perfect
name
he
could
sprint
or
go
a
long
distance
he
could
come
from
behind
or
take
a
command
lead
and
unlike
his
dad
who
be
not
physically
strike
ghostzapper
be
an
intimidate
presence
at
the
track
with
a
powerful
physique
and
muscle
that
bulge
beneath
his
sleek
coat
he
destroyed
most
of
his
opponent
no
horse
in
the
history
of
the
world
have
be
clocked
at
a
faster

drew
me
to

a
look
in

a
stillness
about

sort
of
quiet
confidence
that
you
often
see
in
some
of

on
a
fall
day
back

i
reluctantly
sell
that
champion
with
the
heart
of
a
lion
for
million
it
be
a
huge
blow
to
me
i
have
found
and
developed
a
truly
special
horse
one
of
the
great
and
i
have
to
let
her
go
know
your
business
inside
out
when
you
run
your
own
business
you
ve
get
to
know
the
business
inside
out
you
ve
get
to
have
a
firm
handle
on
all
aspect
of
the
operation
right
down
to
know
where
the
supply
be
store
and
when
the
garbage
get
picked
up
because
when
you
start
overlook
the
small
detail
that
s
when
thing
begin
to
fall
through
the
crack
and
problem
begin
to
snowball
chapter
the
boardroom
revolt
if
someone
tell
me
frank
i
m
a
friend
of
yours
i
always
say
that
s
nice
to
hear
but
you
don
t
have
to
tell
me
prove
it
it
have
take
me
year
to
build
up
my
stable
but
i
have
no
choice
i
have
to
sell
glorious
song
and
many
of
my
best
thoroughbred
to
begin
stockpile
cash
for
a
loom
boardroom
battle
several
member
of
the
magna
board
want
to
push
me
out
and
i
need
to
quickly
raise
cash
to
buy
up
magna
share
in
order
to
prevent
a
hostile
takeover
i
love
my
horse
but
the
business
i
have
built
meant
more
to
me
than
anything
to
prepare
for
the
showdown
i
sell
off
a
sizeable
portion
of
my
stable
liquidate
my
million
dollar
interest
in
glorious
song
and
with
the
cash
i
begin
buying
up
magna
share
on
the
open
market
i
be
not
go
to
lose
magna
even
if
it
cost
me
that
magnificent
horse
interest
rate
be
go
through
the
roof
back
then
they
be
close
to
percent
cause
many
people
to
lose
their
home
so
i
have
to
be
careful
about
how
much
money
i
borrow
from
the
bank
my
only
other
option
be
to
sell
my
most
valuable
horse
in
my
desperation
to
raise
cash
i
practically
give
glorious
song
away
she
fetch
million
three
year
after
i
sell
her
although
she
wasn
t
a
horse
i
have
breed
from
infancy
i
have
purchase
her
when
she
be
just
a
yearling
and
developed
her
into
a
champion
one
of
the
most
celebrate
horse
to
ever
come
out
of
canada
it
devastate
me
to
lose
her
but
magna
that
be
my
life
that
be
the
foundation
of
my
economic
freedom
and
i
wasn
t
go
to
lose
magna
the
attempt
boardroom
coup
have
take
me
completely
by
surprise
i
felt
as
if
i
have
be
knifed
in
the
back
i
own
about
percent
of
the
magna
share
but
i
didn
t
have
complete
control
of
the
company
some
of
the
senior
director
knew
that
there
be
a
rift
between
the
president
helmut
hofmann
and
me
over
the
direction
of
the
company
i
want
to
decentralize
the
company
we
be
grow
into
a
traditional
type
of
corporate
structure
with
one
president
and
everyone
underneath
reporting
to
him
one
big
pyramid
it
wasn
t
the
magna
way
when
you
re
centralize
and
thing
go
wrong
it
s
harder
to
find
the
problem
tougher
to
spot
the
leak
and
crack
but
by
decentralize
you
bring
everything
out
of
the
closet
hofmann
be
a
great
operation
guy
and
i
want
him
to
turn
around
our
aerospace
and
defence
division
the
old
magna
electronics
which
be
flounder
and
start
to
drag
down
our
profit
so
with
the
rift
out
in
full
view
some
director
smell
an
opportunity
to
drive
a
wedge
in
and
seize
control
george
gardiner
one
of
the
director
who
be
orchestrate
the
coup
stood
up
and
say
i
ve
get
a
lot
of
money
invest
here
and
i
don
t
think
the
company
be
be
run
properly
we
think
we
should
have
a
different
ceo
he
level
a
number
of
accusation
against
me
include
misappropriation
of
fund
concern
nickel
and
dime
stuff
like
taxi
fare
and
lunch
expense
a
charge
that
be
later
prove
to
be
unfounded
and
he
conclude
by
say
that
i
be
no
longer
the
best
man
to
run
the
company
look
back
i
be
still
a
little
wet
behind
the
ear
when
it
come
to
boardroom
politics
and
i
didn
t
see
the
coup
brewing
it
be
underhanded
i
believe
it
be
hatch
to
gain
control
by
remove
me
from
the
company
the
director
line
up
against
me
be
not
builder
a
few
of
them
be
savvy
and
experienced
stock
player
who
have
flip
company
and
engineer
takeover
with
me
out
of
the
way
investor
and
competitor
might
have
thought
the
company
be
in
play
large
multinationals
on
the
prowl
for
asset
would
likely
have
swoop
in
and
swallow
us
up
but
in
the
process
the
share
price
would
have
climbed
produce
a
juicy
profit
business
be
business
but
i
take
this
personally
i
be
bleeding
inside
i
say
to
them
you
son
of
bitch
you
didn
t
even
have
the
gut
to
confront
me
in
person
before
the
meeting
this
be
bullshit
i
m
go
to
fight
you
and
i
m
go
to
remove
you
from
the
board
i
guarantee
you
that
and
then
i
walk
out
of
the
boardroom
i
be
always
a
good
toolmaker
a
good
auto
part
maker
but
when
it
come
down
to
the
finer
side
of
business
the
fancy
business
bylaw
and
arcane
stock
exchange
regulation
i
be
out
of
my
element
so
i
have
to
learn
quickly
what
manoeuvre
i
have
at
my
disposal
i
knew
i
have
the
support
of
the
employee
and
the
manager
they
be
guy
like
me
toolmaker
and
factory
worker
from
small
town
like
weiz
and
i
knew
i
have
the
support
of
a
number
of
director
include
tony
czapka
and
burt
pabst
both
sizeable
shareholder
and
trust
friend
who
be
with
me
in
the
early
day
when
we
work
through
the
night
together
to
meet
a
deadline
and
then
ran
box
of
metal
part
over
to
general
motor
in
my
beat
up
chevy
perhaps
the
rebellious
director
thought
i
would
walk
away
from
the
fight
if
they
do
they
underestimated
me
there
be
no
way
i
be
go
to
lose
the
company
that
i
have
built
over
the
past
twenty
year
through
sheer
sacrifice
sweat
and
hustle
for
the
director
magna
be
just
one
of
their
many
investment
for
me
it
be
my
whole
life
i
have
pour
all
of
my
saving
all
of
my
heart
into
that
company
as
a
young
man
i
have
vowed
that
i
would
never
crawl
from
anyone
and
if
some
of
the
director
thought
they
be
go
to
take
the
company
from
me
without
a
fight
they
be
dead
wrong
i
crush
the
boardroom
revolt
and
brought
in
some
new
board
member
i
won
the
battle
but
i
paid
a
heavy
price
financially
and
emotionally
and
i
learn
a
valuable
lesson
i
vowed
from
that
day
on
that
i
would
have
percent
of
the
voting
control
i
kept
buying
up
share
on
the
market
until
i
own
a
clear
majority
of
magna
s
share
i
swore
i
be
never
go
to
let
that
kind
of
close
call
happen
again
it
be
the
first
time
i
come
close
to
lose
everything
i
have
work
so
hard
to
build
but
there
would
come
another
time
and
it
would
be
much
bad
be
transparent
a
business
or
any
organization
function
best
when
everything
be
transparent
worker
be
very
smart
if
they
know
management
be
not
straight
up
or
be
hiding
something
you
will
never
be
able
to
win
their
heart
when
i
have
my
first
factory
i
would
sit
with
the
employee
during
lunch
and
show
them
the
company
bank
book
i
have
always
promise
myself
that
when
i
ran
my
own
business
everything
would
be
upfront
and
out
in
the
open
that
s
why
at
magna
i
create
an
operating
philosophy
that
include
open
book
and
open
door
chapter
unhappiness
be
contagious
unhappiness
be
contagious
and
when
you
have
unhappy
employee
there
s
no
way
you
can
make
a
quality
product
at
a
competitive
price
whenever
i
walk
into
any
magna
factory
in
any
corner
of
the
world
i
don
t
have
to
look
at
the
balance
sheet
to
know
if
it
be
make
money
or
not
all
i
have
to
do
be
look
at
the
employee
face
if
the
employee
be
happy
then
i
know
the
factory
be
a
moneymaker
if
the
employee
don
t
look
happy
odds
be
pretty
good
the
factory
be
lose
money
i
ve
always
maintain
that
unfairness
in
the
workplace
lead
to
unhappiness
and
unhappiness
be
contagious
when
you
have
disgruntle
employee
and
unhappiness

through
the
workplace

make
quality
product
at
a
competitive
price
as
my
business
grow
i
want
to
avoid
the
traditional
automotive
factory
environment
with
punch
clock
and
massive
factory
with
thousand
of
employee
who
become
nameless
and
faceless
number
i
want
to
recreate
the
environment
that
exist
in
the
original
tool
shop
that
i
start
back
in
when
i
knew
every
employee
and
we
would
have
lunch
together
it
be
there
sit
at
the
table
with
our
brown
paper
bag
and
lunch
pail
that
we
would
most
often
solve
a
quality
problem
or
kick
around
idea
for
speed
up
the
production
line
i
want
to
create
a
workplace
that
foster
open
communication
between
management
and
employee
a
place
where
individual
initiative
could
be
recognize
and
reward
this
be
easy
to
do
when
the
business
be
small
once
you
start
grow
and
you
ve
get
thousand
of
employee
you
need
to
start
put
system
in
place
i
have
developed
a
decentralize
entrepreneurial
operating
system
that
drove
our
profit
and
i
have
devise
a
formula
and
a
system
for
share
those
profit
but
my
next
challenge
be
something
just
as
important
to
come
up
with
a
system
for
ensure
the
fair
treatment
of
our
employee
so
in
with
a
grow
number
of
operating
division
locate
throughout
north
america
and
europe
i
create
an
employee
s
charter

be
built
around
the
long
stand
principle
of
fairness
and
concern
for

hallmark
of
magna

framework
for

number
of
fundamental
right

a

the
best
formula
for
ensure
fairness
and
success
if
there
be
problem
in
the

we
provide
employee
with
a
number
of
way
to
let
us
know
about
them
so
that
we
can
flush
out
anything
that
isn
t
right
or
fair
the
most
important
tool
for
root
out
problem
be
the
annual
employee
opinion
survey
which
we
establish
at
all
of
the
company
s
division
soon
after
implement
the
employee
s
charter
the
survey
gauge
the
temperature
of
the
factory
by
listen
to
the
opinion
of
our
employee
and
get
the
pulse
of
how
they
feel
it
have
become
a
vital
tool
for
measure
how
well
magna
s
division
be
living
up
to
the
principle
of
the
employee
s
charter
after
i
introduce
the
employee
opinion
survey
one
of
the
manager
ask
what
be
you
do
frank
spy
on
us
another
manager
be
so
angered
by
it
that
when
the
employee
newsletter
announce
the
new
survey
arrive
at
the
factory
he
take
the
bundle
of
newsprint
and
stand
on
the
load
dock
in
full
view
of
the
employee
hurl
them
into
a
big
metal
waste
bin
he
be
one
of
our
top
manager
tough
but
fair
the
employee
respect
him
but
it
wasn
t
him
that
i
be
worried
about
it
be
all
the
new
manager
who
have
be
hire
during
the
boom
year
of
the
s
when
we
be
opening
new
factory
every
other
month
most
of
these
new
manager
hadn
t
be
immerse
in
the
magna
culture
they
didn
t
come
up
through
the
rank
some
of
them
just
paid
lip
service
to
our
fair
enterprise
culture
but
didn
t
really
live
it
so
if
there
be
unfairness
or
if
employee
be
be
treat
poorly
the
survey
would
flush
it
out
and
we
would
remove
the
bad
manager
in
future
year
when
we
start
grow
globally
we
create
a
management
training
program
specifically
design
to
instill
the
magna
culture
in
our
new
manager
so
that
the
fair
enterprise
principle
would
run
through
their
vein
we
call
it
magnatizing
them
because
employee
be
partner
in
magna
s
profitability
i
believe
they
should
have
a
say
in
how
the
company
be
run
when
worker
be
give
a
voice
in
run
the
business
when
there
be
great
democracy
in
the
workplace
it
be
much
easy
to
make
a
well
product
for
a
well
price
in
the
early
s
i
establish
a
new
mechanism
for
resolve
dispute
at
the
divisional
level
one
that
place
a
great
amount
of
decision
make
power
in
the
hand
of
employee
fairness
committee
become
an
important
vehicle
for
help
to
clear
up
misunderstanding
and
resolve
problem
within
a
division
fairness
committee
be
employee
democracy
in
action
compose
of
up
to
five
volunteer
from
rank
and
file
employee
to
managerial
staff
the
committee
could
and
sometimes
do
overturn
management
decision
a
few
year
later
i
introduce
another
tool
of
employee
democracy
secret
ballot
voting
much
like
fairness
committee
secret
ballot
voting
be
design
to
give
employee
a
great
say
in
manage
workplace
issue
that
have
an
impact
on
the
entire
division
and
more
recently
in
north
america
we
create
a
new
employee
position
know
as
the
employee
advocate
the
advocate
s
job
be
to
ensure
that
employee
issue
and
concern
be
resolve
quickly
and
in
accordance
with
magna
s
fair
enterprise
principle
and
operating
philosophy
only
employee
via
a
secret
ballot
vote
can
dismiss
an
advocate
i
fundamentally
believe
that
if
employee
know
they
be
treat
fairly
and
that
their
contribution
be
fairly
reward
they
will
become
more
involve
in
search
for
way
to
improve
productivity
and
quality
i
also
believe
that
employee
know
well
than
anyone
else
what
work
best
in
their
own
workplace
when
i
be
a
manager
during
magna
s
early
day
i
always
use
to
sit
down
with
employee
and
ask
them
for
idea
on
how
to
make
thing
well
i
make
sure
they
have
a
say
in
how
we
ran
the
factory
that
s
why
we
ve
always
try
to
create
a
workplace
environment
at
magna
where
employee
be
not
afraid
to
speak
freely
or
to
voice
their
concern
when
employee
feel
that
someone
be
stand
behind
them
with
a
whip
when
they
re
afraid
to
speak
their
mind
there
s
no
way
you
ll
be
able
to
motivate
or
inspire
them
i
would
always
tell
our
manager
if
an
employee
criticizes
you
and
you
hit
the
employee
over
the
head
with
a
two
by
four
figuratively
speak
no
one
will
ever
speak
up
again
once
that
happens
you
ve
lose
your
partner
in
profitability
and
you
re
probably
on
the
road
to
lose
your
profitability
as
well
it
s
hard
to
always
be
fair
because
we
live
in
a
world
that
be
imperfect
and
people
can
sometimes
act
irresponsibly
and
i
m
the
first
to
admit
that
we
re
not
perfect
but
through
the
charter
and
other
employee
program
i
believe
we
create
a
system
that
strives
to
uphold
fairness
when
you
boil
it
right
down
it
s
pretty
simple
if
employee
aren
t
happy
their
heart
be
not
in
their
work
and
they
will
only
do
what
they
have
to
do
to
keep
their
job
but
if
you
ve
get
a
healthy
and
happy
work
environment
if
employee
feel
that
they
re
part
of
something
special
with
a
tangible
stake
in
the
outcome
and
manager
who
recognize
and
reward
individual
contribution
they
ll
become
more
involve
in
search
for
way
to
improve
productivity
and
quality
it
s
not
easy
be
a
manager
because
the
customer
be
always
breathing
down
your
neck
management
also
have
an
obligation
to
look
after
our
shareholder
who
count
on
us
to
give
them
a
decent
return
on
their
investment
but
we
re
constantly
hammer
away
at
our
manager
to
remember
that
our
first
obligation
be
to
our
employee
shareholder
come
and
go
but
worker
be
always
go
to
be
there
be
the
best
pursue
what
make
you
happy
because
you
can
t
be
good
at
anything
if
your
heart
s
not
in
it
but
if
you
enjoy
do
something
chance
be
you
ll
do
it
well
and
if
you
give
an
extra
effort

be
you
could
be
among
the
very
best
at
what
you

we
would
buy
gm
it
drew
a
lot
of
laughter
but
i
don
t
think
anyone
realize
i
be
only
half
joking
of
course
we
never
do
buy
gm
but
we
almost
bought
a
big
piece
of
the
carmaker
back
in
when
we
hammer
out
a
deal
with
gm
to
purchase
adam
opel
ag
their
european
carmaking
operation
political
meddling
end
up
muddy
the
water
and
the
deal
fell
apart
many
of
the
product
line
that
magna
still
make
today
be
first
engineer
and
manufacture
during
the
roar
s
magna
introduce
a
number
of
new
product
during
the
decade
everything
from
sunroof
to
instrument
cluster
by
the
end
of
the
decade
our
transmission
and
engine
system
group
have
become
one
of
the
large
manufacturer
in
north
america
for
part
underneath
the
hood
but
where
magna
really
left
its
mark
where
we
truly
transform
the
industry
be
our
strategy
of
create
large
and
more
complex
vehicle
system
and
module
it
be
the
well
product
for
a
well
price
formula
on
an
even
big
scale
while
most
auto
supplier
where
content
to
make
the
simple
component
that
detroit
jobbed
out
we
push
the
idea
of
bundling
a
bunch
of
different
part
into
a
large
vehicle
system
for
example
combine
all
of
the
wire
and
latch
and
lock
that
make
up
the
electro
mechanical
cartilage
of
a
car
door
and
packaging
it
together
into
a
single
door
module
by
do
so
we
be
able
to
save
the
car
manufacturer
time
and
money
when
it
come
to
assemble
their
vehicle
instead
of
string
cable
and
attach
wire
to
the
metal
shell
of
the
inner
door
we
would
give
them
a
pre
assemble
cassette
with
all
of
the
hardware
and
wiring
attach
a
big
chunk
that
an
assembly
line
worker
could
simply
bolt
into
the
door
it
save
time
money
space
you
name
it
the
automaker
clamour
for
more
if
we
could
do
the
innards
of
a
door
maybe
we
could
do
the
complete
interior
of
the
car
the
dashboard
the
seat
everything
and
indeed
we
could
it
be
the
next
big
step
up
in
our
evolution
from
a
part
maker
to
a
sophisticated
modular
system
supplier
more
importantly
it
help
make
the
company
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
in
new
sale
as
we
begin
building
big
and
big
piece
of
the
car
we
start
win
contract
for
modular
door
and
because
we
make
interior
plastic
panel
and
metal
door
panel
as
well
as
latch
we
could
stuff
more
magna
content
into
the
module
boost
our
sale
even
high
we
begin
set
our
sight
on
the
major
overseas
market
of
europe
and
japan
we
establish
our
first
european
manufacturing
facility
in
germany
in
to
produce
transmission
belt
component
for
the
european
market
it
be
the
seed
of
what
would
later
become
magna
europe
it
s
funny
how
thing
sometimes
turn
out
more
than
thirty
year
after
i
left
the
people

place
where
i
be
born
my
past
have
suddenly
become
an
important
part
of
my
future
and
the
future
of
magna
in
the
late
s
i
return
to
austria
to
build
a
new

factory
in
my
hometown
of
weiz
it
be
call

and
it
manufacture
power
pack
the
electrical
gut
of
the

weiz
be
a
natural
location
it
have
a
large
skilled
labour
pool
and
be
centrally
locate
within
the
european

a
large
number
of

from
the

town
and
city
of
styria
the
austrian

where

a
way
of
give
back
to
the
community
that
have
give
both
me
and

so
much
many
more
factory
follow
in
the
year
ahead
by
this
time
fred

he
be
one
of
magna
s
great
builder
a
true
innovator
with
a
knack
for
discover
new
technology
you
wouldn
t
think
that
the
auto
industry
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
the
way
farm
tractor
be

but
that
s
exactly
how
fred

method
for

fred
be
flip
through
a
german
magazine
one
day
in
when
he
read
about
a
new
technology
for
make
tractor

fred
call
the
inventor
georg
grammer
and
flew
to
hamburg
west
germany
the
next
day
to
meet
him
that
meeting
in
lead
to
a
joint
venture
with
grammer
seat
system
and
a
few
year
later
integram
magna
s
new
seat
division
introduce
a
patent
foam
technology
know
as
foam
in
place
seat
a
revolutionary
advance
that
eliminate
the
traditional
cut
and
sew
production
method
for
manufacturing
seat
after
develop
some
prototype
seat
integram
won
magna
s
first
major
contract
to
supply
complete
seat
system
as
luck
would
have
it
the
seat
debut
on
the
chrysler
minivan
which
would
go
on
to
become
one
of
the
best
sell
vehicle
in
automotive
history
our
breakthrough
foam
in

also
become
an
important
new
product
line
and
help
start
magna
down
the
road
to
become
one
of
the
industry
s
lead
supplier
of
seat
system
a
few
year
later
when
fred
be
take
his
young
son
for
a
ride
one
day
he
hit
on
a
new
idea
after
struggle
with
buckling
his
son
into
the
car
the
built
in
child
safety
seat
it
be
an
industry
first
and
magna
jointly
developed
the
innovative
product
with
chrysler
use
the
same
foam
in
place
technology
that
produce
seat
for
the
chrysler
minivan
some
ten
year
later
magna
have
sell
more
than
million
unit
worldwide
that
same
year
our
unique
built
in
child
safety
seat
be
induct
into
the
smithsonian
institution
in
washington
d
c
as
one
of
the
great
innovation
of
the
s
perhaps
the
single
big
technological
advance
for
magna
during
the
s
be
the
development
of
the
capability
to
produce
large
exterior
stamp
component
such
as
hood
trunk
and
fender
up
until
that
point
magna
have
supply
mostly
small
stamp
part
but
an
opportunity
to
move
into
large
metal
stampings
arose
after
renault
bought
american
motor
corporation
amc
renault
have
a
new
amc
vehicle
schedule
to
go
into
production
but
didn
t
have
enough
money
to
open
a
new
large
stamp
facility
so
we
convince
renault
to
award
us
the
stamp
contract
even
though
we
have
never
supply
large
metal
stampings
and
have
no
press
capable
of
produce
the
part
the
only
thing
we
do
have
be
a
take
it
to
the
bank
reputation
for

what
we
say
we
d
do
every

we
tackle
succeed
we
didn
t
know
what
we
be
get
into
but
we
knew
we
would
somehow
find
a
way
to
make
it
work
in
we
won
a
massive
contract
to
manufacture
the
entire
outer
body
sheet

for
a
new
vehicle
to
be
introduce
in

when
chrysler
bought
the
struggle
american

from

they
inherit
the

meanwhile
built
our
karmax

be
the

of
its
day
it
didn
t
matter
that
the

be
a
flop
it
be
our
first
foray
into
the
business
of
produce
large
metal
piece
and
it
become
a
key
building
block
in
magna
s
long
term
strategy
of
provide
total
vehicle
capability
to
our
customer
more
than
twenty
year
later
the
karmax
facility
we
built
back
in
the
s
still
remains
one
of
the
world
s
big
and
best
sheet
metal
stamp
facility
but
it
be
also
during
this
time
that
the
magna
culture
face
one
of
its
first
challenge
and
it
come
from
the
man
who
have
help
me
build
magna
my
friend
tony
czapka
tony
have
a
very
strong
bond
with
his
son
peter
who
be
a
toolmaker
like
his
father
and
have
also
obtain
a
business
degree
at
one
of
the
top
school
in
the
country
one
day
tony
approach
me
and
say
he
want
me
to
sell
him
one
of
the
magna
factory
a
factory
that
he
and
his
son
could
own
and
operate
together
but
i
couldn
t
do
it
shareholder
wouldn
t
have
be
too
pleased
that
i
let
a
good
factory
go
to
what
would
have
become
in
effect
a
competitor
it
would
have
set
a
bad
precedent
next
thing
i
know
other
manager
might
be
come
up
to
me
and
say
hey
frank
can
i
buy
this
factory
tony
and
i
have
a
major
disagreement
and
go
a
long
spell
without
talk
to
one
another
it
pain
me
because
he
be
my
best
friend
as
long
as
i
have
know
him
he
be
always
there
for
me
when
i
need
him
if
there
be
a
job
we
have
to
get
out
who
show
up
on
a
sunday
night
always
tony
so
i
kept
mull
over
possible
solution
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
my
friend
but
at
the
same
time
i
couldn
t
sabotage
the
magna
culture
i
have
create
after
a
long
while
i
come
up
with
a
solution
i
suggest
a
split
with
the
one
condition
that
the
factory
have
to
function
accord
to
the
magna
operating
philosophy
and
the
fair
enterprise
principle
that
every
other
magna
plant
live
by
it
meant
the
employee
s
charter
profit
and
equity
share
the
whole
nine
yard
this
way
the
factory
would
still
be
part
of
the
magna
family
of
company
and
still
operate
under
the
same
principle
what
s
more
magna
shareholder
would
benefit
as
well
i
say
to
tony
i
think
i
ve
finally
found
a
solution
that
i
can
justify
to
the
shareholder
to
the
rest
of
our
manager
and
to
our
worker
i
think
i
ve
hit
on
an
answer
that
would
allow
me
to
stand
up
in
front
of
our
shareholder
or
the
worker
in
the
factory
and
say
this
be
fair
to
everyone
tony
agree
the
business
be
still
in
operation
today
and
although
tony
pass
away
at
a
far
too
young
age
in
the
early
s
his
son
peter
still
run
the
plant
that
bear
the
name
of
our
very
first
factory
multimatic
follow
the
incident
with
tony
i
table
a
motion
with
magna
s
board
to
make
it
company
policy
that
our
most
successful
operation
manager
could
negotiate
joint
venture
partnership
with
magna
that
way
we
could
retain
the
very
best
operator
and
innovator
the
bona
fide
builder
who
be
make
million
for
the
company
these
guy
be
hawk
who
have
hone
their
business
skill
work
within
magna
s
eat
what
you
kill
compensation
formula
the
last
thing
i
want
be
to
have
one
of
them
become
a
competitor
besides
i
would
sooner
have
a
slice
of
the
profit
from
dozen
of
successful
partnership
than
all
of
the
profit
from
a
wholly
own
company
run
in
a
traditional
centralize
fashion
as
the
decade
come
to
a
close
we
start
spread
our
footprint
throughout
europe
we
receive
our
first
major
customer
order
from
a
big
european
carmaker
a
large
stamp
contract
from
volkswagen
that
lead
to
the
construction
of
new
facility
not
only
in
europe
but
in
canada
and
mexico
as
well
close
to
home
the
big
three
still
claimed
percent
of
the
automotive
market
share
in
north
america
and
although
gm
ford
and
chrysler
be
our
main
customer
the
foreign
domestic
as
they
be
know
begin
to
make
their
presence
felt
in
north
america
in
the

honda
lead
the
way
become
the
first
japanese
carmaker
to
assemble
vehicle
in
the
u
s
in
a
number
of
other
japanese
and
european
automaker
follow
it
be
also
around
this
time
that
we
set
up
shop
in
the
soviet
union
the
crumble
communist
state
that
ronald
reagan
have

of
my

me
to
tour
some
of
the
soviet
automotive

and
assembly

travel
by

early
in
the
even
and
rid
for
the
well
part
of
a
day

bring
the
passenger
black
tea
and
cooky
outside
the
train
window
there
be
hardly
any
home
or
building
just
mile
after
mile
of
barren
landscape
we
visit
various
factory
fill
with
antiquate
equipment
and
assembly
line
that
look
like
they
hadn
t
change
since
the
day
of
joseph
stalin
several
day
later
have
tour
the
soviet
auto
assembly
plant
i
met
with
the
industry
minister
in
moscow
we
have
dinner
and
more
than
a
few
vodka
the
senior
apparatchik
ask
me
what
i
thought
of
the
soviet
auto
industry
not
much
i
answer
he
be
a
little
take
aback
what
do
you
mean
i
reply
the
way
your
industry
be
structure
you
can
t
make
quality
car
and
you
can
t
even
produce
enough
car
to
satisfy
the
demand
of
your
people
he
then
ask
me
why
i
thought
that
be
so
and
i
say
your
problem
be
you
don
t
have
a
competitive
environment
he
wasn
t
quite
sure
what
i
meant
so
i
put
it
to
him
this
way
you
know
why
your
country
always
do
so
well
at
the
olympics
it
s
because
you
ve
get
lot
of
competition
when
there
be
no
competition
even
a
fat
guy
could
win
the
race
if
he
s
the
only
runner
on
the
track
i
then
pull
out
a
pen
and
start
sketch
my
chart
show
the
world
s
three
major
economic
system
when
i
drew
the
pyramid
represent
free
enterprise
with
the
capitalist
at
the
top
of
the
pyramid
and
the
worker
at
the
bottom
he
start
to
chuckle
all
the
louder
because
it
be
come
from
a
capitalist
like
me
i
say
don
t
laugh
your
pyramid
be
upside
down
and
if
you
didn
t
have
force
and
regulate
labour
it
would
fall
over
when
i
finish
by
explain
how
fair
enterprise
work
by
turn
worker
into
capitalist
and
by
create
a
string
of
small
pyramid
rather
than
one
large
pyramid
he
raise
his
glass
of
vodka
and
make
a
toast
to
my
radical
new
system
for
wealth
creation
and
distribution
it
be
the
late
s
and
by
this
time
we
be
make
virtually
every
single
component
of
the
car
save
the
engine
the
tire
and
the
windshield
we
make
so
many
of
the
system
and
module
under
the
hood
and
from
bumper
to
bumper
that
it
be
only
natural
that
we
would
start
put
everything
together
by
engineering
and
prototyping
complete
vehicle
it
be
around
this
time
that
we
unveiled
the
torrero
magna
s
first
concept
car
a
stun
high
performance
luxury
vehicle
that
take
two
year
to
complete
the
torrero
s
revolutionary
design
foreshadow
the
rise
of
the
suv
and
its
style
be
so
advanced
that
it
still
look
futuristic
today
more
than
twenty
year
later
the
torrero
sent
a
strong
message
to
the
automotive
world
magna
could
not
only
make
any
part
of
the
vehicle
it
could
also
design
and
develop
complete
vehicle
for
its
customer
i
thought
the
time
be
right
for
me
to
make
a
pitch
to
roger
smith
the
former
chairman
and
ceo
of
general
motor
i
come
to
detroit
and
have
lunch
with
him
my
bold
proposal
give
magna
the
green
light
to
start
building
car
for
gm
i
say
roger
what
business
be
you
in
he
look
at
me
somewhat
strangely
and
say
we
re
in
the
business
of
make
car
and
then
i
say
your
main
business
be
sell
car
let
magna
make
the
car
i
proceed
to
tell
him
how
magna
could
make
well
quality
car
for
general
motor
at
a
low
price
at
the
time
gm
be
suffer
from
labour
relation
strife
and
nag
quality
problem
that
saw
its
once
dominant
market
share
start
to
slide
smith
didn
t
outright
dismiss
my
proposal
to
start
building
car
for
what
be
at
that
time
the
world
s
large
automaker
in
fact
i
think
he
saw
a
lot
of
merit
in
the
possibility
of
jobbing
out
vehicle
design
and
assembly
to
a
company
like
magna
but
he
say
his
corporation
s
hand
be
tie
the
powerful
united
auto
worker
uaw
union
would
never
tolerate
the
outsource
of
vehicle
assembly
we
have
go
from
make
part
to
make
advanced
modular
system
manufacturing
complete
car
be
our
next
step
it
wasn
t
to
be
back
then
but
by
the
time
the
next
decade
come
to
a
close
we
be
building
car
for
our
customer
by
the
ten
of
thousand
know
the
price
you
pay
when
start
your
own
business
most
individual
who
start
a
business
from
scratch
pay
a
heavy
price
and
face
fairly
tough
odds
of
succeed
that
s
why
the
reward
have
to
be
substantial
own
and
operating
a
business
mean
a
lot
of
early
morning
and
long
hour
and
late
night
if
you
want
to
run
your
own
business
you
have
well
forget
about
nine
to
five
workday
and
weekend
off
it
s
a
sacrifice
that
most
people
be
not
willing
to
make
there
be
many
path
to
success
but
no
shortcut
chapter
just
call
me
frank
there
be
no
bad
employee
only
bad
manager
back
in
the
s
a
magazine
rat
me
one
of
the
ten
toughest
executive
to
work
for
in
canada
i
don
t
know
what
they
base
their
conclusion
on
but
i
certainly
don
t
see
myself
as
tough
or
overbear
i
do
however
expect
people
to
put
forth
their
very
best
effort
and
i
do
have
an
expectation
of
quality
and
excellence
because
that
be
what
our
customer
expect
but
i
have
always
sought
to
achieve
those
result
by
motivate
people
and
encourage
them
to
do
the
best
they
can
i
try
to
attract
people
who
want
to
work
with
me
who
be
excite
to
be
part
of
what
we
be
try
to
accomplish
besides
when
you
get
a
piece
of
the
action
when
you
share
in
the
profit
your
company
make
which
be
the
magna
way
you
instinctively
want
to
do
everything
to
the
best
of
your
ability
you
want
to
produce
work
of
the
high
calibre
because
you
re
part
of
something
you
take
pride
in
part
of
something
where
you
have
a
tangible
sense
of
ownership
you
feel
that
your
contribution
make
a
difference
and
be
financially
reward
i
ve
always
believe
there
be
no
bad
employee
only
bad
manager
i
try
to
seek
constructive
criticism
to
motivate
and
inspire
i
never
yell
or
pound
my
fist
on
the
desk
or
fly
off
the
handle
it
s
simply
not
in
my
nature
i
ve
always
operate
accord
to
the
principle
that
there
should
be
a
rationale
for
everything
you
do
in
life
and
in
business
and
i
always
try
to
communicate
to
others
the
reason
for
any
undertaking
i
support
i
think
i
m
a
pretty
regular
guy
i
don
t
wear
flashy
jewellery
or
gold
watch
if
i
weren
t
meeting
banker
or
auto
executive
i
d
probably
be
wear
a
pair
of
jean
and
a
leather
bomber
jacket
instead
of
a
suit
i
also
don
t
think
that
wealth
have
change
me
i
consider
myself
the
same
person
who
get
off
a
passenger
ship
in
quebec
city
more
than
fifty
year
ago
with
a
few
hundred
buck
and
a
few
pair
of
pant
t
shirt
and
windbreaker
in
a
small
suitcase
i
ve
never
insist
on
formal
title
or
tolerate
kowtow
and
i
ve
never
join
fancy
country
club
or
elite
institution
when
i
meet
employee
or
other
individual
they
sometimes
call
me
mr
stronach
or
even
sir
i
always
say
just
call
me
frank
employee
know
that
i
m
not
some
suit
with
an
mba
degree
who
have
never
see
the
inside
of
a
factory
i
ve
work
on
many
of
the
same
machine
they
have
and
i
ve
do
most
of
the
manufacturing
job
they
have
perform
so
they
feel
that
i
can
relate
to
them
i
encourage
them
to
talk
to
me
on
the
same
level
that
they
would
talk
to
a
co
worker
or
a
friend
because
in
the
final
analysis
my
chief
responsibility
be
to
find
way
to
continuously
improve
what
we
do
and
to
constantly
motivate
initiate
and
inspire
the
experience
i
ve
accumulate
in
life
have
make
me
the
manager
i
be
today
i
ve
be
without
work
and
without
food
i
ve
be
discriminate
against
and
treat
unfairly
i
ve
never
forgotten
those
experience
and
so
because
of
my
own
personal
experience
work
at
menial
job
and
slug
it
out
on
the
factory
floor
i
be
perhaps
more
sensitive
to
the
kind
of
issue
that
matter
most
to
employee
it
be
the
fundamental
reason
why
i
have
focus
throughout
my
career
on
find
innovative
way
to
motivate
the
human
capital
for
great
productivity
and
ingenuity
business
school
be
constantly
teach
new
theory
about
management
and
leadership
they
re
a
lot
like
fashion
trend
popular
one
year
and
then
out
of
style
the
next
but
i
believe
the
real
key
to
be
a
good
manager
or
leader
consists
in
living
by
a
series
of
timeless
principle
the
most
important
of
these
principle
be
trust
when
you
re
a
manager
you
have
to
work
hard
to
win
the
trust
and
respect
of
your
employee
and
when
it
come
to
trust
there
be
no
shortcut
or
detour
once
you
ve
lose
that
trust
you
can
never
get
it
back
as
a
manager
whenever
i
say
something
i
always
try
to
live
up
to
my
promise
no
matter
what
the
additional
cost
in
time
or
money
no
matter
how
tempt
it
might
have
be
to
take
the
easy
way
out
that
s
how
you
build
up
trust
if
somebody
tell
me
frank
i
m
a
friend
of
yours
i
always
say
that
s
nice
to
hear
but
you
don
t
have
to
tell
me
prove
it
as
a
manager
you
have
to
prove
day
in
and
day
out
that
you
have
a
concern
for
the
well
be
of
your
employee
a
business
or
any
organization
function
best
when
everything
be
transparent
worker
be
very
smart
if
they
know
management
isn
t
straight
up
or
be
hiding
something
you
will
never
be
able
to
win
their
heart
when
i
have
my
first
factory
i
would
sit
with
the
guy
at
lunch
and
show
them
the
company
s
bank
book
i
would
say
look
this
be
what
we
ve
make
so
far
i
have
always
promise
myself
that
when
i
ran
my
own
business
everything
would
be
upfront
and
out
in
the
open
that
s
why
at
magna
i
create
an
operating
philosophy
that
include
open
book
and
open
door
it
s
critical
that
a
manager
maintain
an
environment
where
employee
can
talk
about
problem
that
arise
in
the
workplace
that
way
if
something
isn
t
right
you
can
flush
it
out
and
deal
with
it
some
of
our
best
manager
at
magna
didn
t
even
have
office
just
a
desk
on
the
factory
floor
they
be
always
available
to
discus
issue
that
popped
up
from
time
to
time
manager
must
also
know
their
employee
what
be
their
hope
and
aspiration
and
future
plan
what
be
their
concern
and
the
only
way
you
can
know
that
be
if
you
re
always
on
the
floor
with
them
my
philosophy
have
always
be
that
employee
don
t
work
for
you
they
work
with
you
i
remember
many
time
during
the
early
year
of
my
business
when
we
would
work
late
into
the
night
to
meet
a
deadline
i
would
roll
up
my
sleeve
and
work
on
a
bench
alongside
everyone
else
there

various
charity
hospital

i
also
serve

a

by
the
direction
i
saw
the
country
take
i
felt
i
could
make
a
contribution
so
in
the
spring
of
i
resign
as
ceo
of
magna
international
to
run
for
public
office
i
announce
my
intention
to
become
the
candidate
for
the
liberal
party
of
canada
in
york
simcoe
the
electoral
district
where
i
live
and
if
elect
i
promise
to
go
to
the
nation
s
capital
and
rattle
the
cage
of
the
political
elite
for
month
prior
to
the
announcement
i
have
be
very
outspoken
in
regard
to
a
propose
free
trade
agreement
between
canada
and
the
united
state
i
be
one
of
a
handful
of
high
profile
businessmen
who
be
speak
out
against
the
agreement
for
one
i
believe
there
be
no
such
thing
as
true
free
trade
there
never
be
and
there
never
will
be
there
will
always
be
exception
and
exemption
and
exclusion
when
i
be
a
kid
and
i
played
marble
with
a
much
big
kid
even
if
i
beat
him
i
be
smart
enough
to
know
that
i
always
have
to
hand
over
the
marble
when
it
come
to
trade
and
tariff
dispute
and
access
to
market
the
big
kid
be
go
to
get
all
the
marble
every
time
what
s
more
i
believe
in
fair
trade
not
free
trade
the
bottom
line
be
that
trade
between
nation
must
always
relate
to
job
some
of
the
rhetoric
surround
the
free
trade
debate
be
base
on
anti
american
feeling
but
that
be
never
the
case
with
me
in
fact
as
a
canadian
if
i
have
to
choose
any
country
in
the
world
for
a
neighbour
it
would
be
the
united
state
i
simply
felt
that
the
price
canada
be
go
to
pay
as
a
result
of
the
free
trade
agreement
in
term
of
lose
job
and
lose
manufacturing
be
too
steep
and
i
felt
that
canada
be
not
prepared
to
step
into
the
ring
against
the
much
big
and
tougher
american
i
ve
never
be
one
for
party
label
i
believe
a
politician
s
character
and
principle
be
far
more
important
besides
on
many
issue
i
be
more
conservative
than
the
conservative
but
the
free
trade
issue
put
me
squarely
in
the
corner
of
the
liberal
i
told
bill
davis
a
member
of
magna
s
board
of
director
and
the
former
long
serve
premier
of
ontario
about
my
intention
to
run
bill
be
widely
consider
one
of
the
wise
and
shrewdest
politician
in
the
country
shortly
after
leave
office
i
ask
him
to
join
magna
s
board
where
he
serve
with
distinction
for
many
year
when
i
inform
him
that
i
be
go
to
run
he
say
frank
you
re
run
for
the
wrong
party
you
re
run
in
the
wrong
district
and
you
re
run
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
free
trade
issue
i
reply
i
know
it
s
easy
to
swim
downstream
i
know
it
s
easy
to
flow
with
the
wind
but
from
time
to
time
you
have
to
look
in
the
mirror
and
say
this
be
what
i
stand
for
tony
czapka
have
always
felt
i
be
a
bit
of
a
do
gooder
he
d
constantly
say
to
me
frank
you
re
not
go
to
change
society
when
i
announce
that
i
be
run
for
office
tony
just
shook
his
head
he
say
frank
come
on
how
can
you
be
that
stupid
they
ll
tear
you
apart
they
ll
drag
you
through
the
mud
who
need
it
tony
be
right
i
need
to
run
like
i
need
a
hole
in
the
head
but
once
i
make
up
my
mind
there
s
not
much
that
can
convince
me
to
abandon
or
change
my
course
i
have
make
my
decision
i
be
go
to
try
to
inject
some
business
sense
into
parliament
the
boardroom
of
the
nation
i
come
storm
out
of
the
gate
our
campaign
slogan
be
let
s
be
frank
and
frank
i
be
sometimes
brutally
so
i
say
we
need
more
politician
who
weren
t
run
for
office
because
it
be
the
best
paycheque
they
ve
ever
have
but
because
they
want
to
serve
the
country
and
have
a
lot
of
experience
to
offer
one
of
the
line
i
always
use
in
my
stump
speech
be
that
parliament
should
have
more
engineer
farmer
doctor
perhaps
a
few
lawyer
and
maybe
even
the
odd
toolmaker
in
the
final
analysis
i
would
say
we
need
some
good
business
people
to
go
in
there
and
straighten
thing
out
most
people
don
t
trust
politician
so
i
thought
i
would
be
more
effective
if
i
simply
present
myself
as
i
be
a
businessman
look
to
bring
some
economic
common
sense
to
the
nation
s
capital
and
while
a
lot
of
the
voter
found
my
direct
straight
shoot
style
of
speak
refresh
a
number
found
me
a
touch
too
blunt
for
public
office
i
threw
one
of
the
large
political
fundraise
dinner
in
liberal
party
history
and
be
enthusiastically
welcome
into
the
fold
by
liberal
party
leader
john
turner
although
the
national
press
insinuate
that
i
have
already
cut
a
deal
with
turner
to
be
make
a
cabinet
minister
if
the
liberal
won
a
claim
that
be
not
true
the
medium
begin
tear
me
apart
it
be
open
season
opposition
politician
and
columnist
be
shoot
poison
arrow
from
every
direction
sinclair
stevens
a
former
conservative
cabinet
minister
be
unceremoniously
drop
by
the
party
as
the
candidate
in
the
rid
where
i
be
run
in
a
part
shot
just
before
the
election
he
call
me
turner
s
little
corporal
it
be
one
of
the
first
of
many
low
blow
i
would
have
to
absorb
in
the
week
and
month
to
come
i
sank
my
teeth
into
the
job
i
knock
on
door
i
really
try
to
get
a
feel
for
the
temperature
of
the
voter
i
dove
right
into
the
nitty
gritty
of
the
campaign
i
even
get
involve
in
create
a
tongue
and
groove
design
for
the
wooden
stake
that
held
my
campaign
sign
they
may
not
have
be
the
snazziest
sign
but
they
be
the
best
built
i
didn
t
like
ask
people
for
the
vote
which
be
what
any
would
be
politician
have
to
do
it
be
the
one
aspect
of
run
that
i
like
least
pound
on
door
in
the
darkness
of
a
cold
november
night
with
sleet
come
down
and
voter
berating
me
for
this
or
that
i
would
occasionally
stop
and
ask
myself
why
be
i
do
this
but
i
soldier
on
usually
work
very
late
into
the
night
i
be
work
longer
and
harder
than
i
have
in
many
many
year
like
anything
in
life
the
more
you
do
the
more
you
try
to
do
the
more
you
expose
yourself
to
criticism
we
have
a
factory
in
the
town
where
we
live
that
become
a
headline
story
in
the
local
press
because
of
accusation
from
resident
that
it
be
the
source
of
foul
smell
emission
my
political
opponent
jumped
on
the
controversy
as
a
way
to
tar
me
my
son
would
come
home
from
school
and
tell
me
the
other
kid
be
say
your
dad
s
stink
up
the
town
i
always
say
i
wouldn
t
have
be
a
quiet
backbencher
i
would
have
be
very
outspoken
and
call
thing
the
way
i
saw
them
they
couldn
t
have
put
a
muzzle
on
me
but
at
the
same
time
i
would
have
put
forth
constructive
solution
i
always
try
to
take
the
high
road
but
there
be
time
when
i
get
drag
into
the
gutter
and
end
up
brawling
during
the
all
candidate
debate
i
usually
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
government
spending
and
bureaucracy
be
grow
out
of
control
instead
of
new
factory
be
built
what
you
would
increasingly
see
be
new
office
tower
housing
bureaucrat
for
one
of
the
countless
government
department
from
four
different
level
of
government
during
one
debate
my
conservative
opponent
john
cole
an
optometrist
by
profession
interrupt
me
and
say
frank
you
keep
talk
about
these
government
office
go
up
but
i
don
t
see
any
well
i
reply
you
well
get
a
new
eye
doctor
cole
a
good
and
decent
man
would
many
year
later
work
alongside
me
on
the
election
campaign
for
my
daughter
belinda
in
the
same
electoral
district
where
i
ran
on
election
day
together
with
hundred
of
other
liberal
candidate
across
the
country
i
come
up
against
a
tidal
wave
of
public
opinion
one
that
swept
into
office
candidate
who
support
the
free
trade
agreement
with
the
united
state
spearhead
by
prime
minister
brian
mulroney
it
be
one
of
the
most
lopsided
victory
in
canadian
political
history
and
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
the
conservative
would
next
govern
the
country
five
year
later
the
party
splinter
along
regional
and
ideological
line
and
be
thrown
from
office
by
an
angry
electorate
i
never
would
have
imagine
that
it
would
be
my
daughter
belinda
who
would
play
a
key
role
in
unite
the
two
feud
faction
of
the
old
progressive
conservative
help
resurrect
the
party
under
a
new
name
and
then
go
on
to
run
for
the
leadership
of
the
revitalize
party
look
back
now
i
wish
i
have
try
to
talk
her
out
of
run
she
take
the
country
by
storm
a
fresh
new
voice
people
could
sense
her
genuine
goodwill
and
her
passion
for
change
but
even
though
she
be
a
quick
learner
and
a
season
corporate
executive
she
be
not
prepared
for
the
dirty
cutthroat
world
of
politics
i
be
like
any
father
despite
some
misgiving
you
may
have
in
the
end
you
want
your
child
to
pursue
their
dream
i
be
proud
that
my
daughter
be
willing
to
serve
her
country
proud
that
the
people
who
live
in
the
district
where
she
grow
up
and
raise
her
family
elect
her
as
their
representative
but
it
be
painful
for
me
as
a
father
to
see
the
verbal
assault
and
personal
threat
she
endure
for
stand
up
for
what
she
thought
be
best
for
the
country
on
the
night
of
my
election
loss
i
spoke
to
the
campaign
worker
in
the
same
room
where
i
have
announce
my
candidacy
more
than
half
a
year
earlier
some
of
them
be
cry
i
say
let
it
be
the
voter
have
spoken
life
go
on
after
the
election
tony
czapka
come
up
to
me
and
say
you
see
frank
you
try
to
do
some
good
and
they
kick
you
in
the
as
in
hindsight
i
would
have
do
some
thing
differently
for
one
i
would
have
be
more
careful
about
get
drawn
into
traditional
debate
and
stick
to
the
party
playbook
instead
i
would
have
focus
on
what
people
really
want
to
talk
about
i
would
also
have
be
a
little
less

a
little
less
brusque
run
for
office
taught
me
a
great
deal
i
have
a
much
well
understand
of
how
intricate
and
interwoven
different
aspect
of
society
really
be
of
how
complex
and
sometimes
contradictory
democracy
can
be
i
take
some
abuse
to
be
sure
but
the
experience
give
me
a
good
strong
dose
of
humility
and
ultimately
it
make
me
a
wiser
man
i
think
i
could
have
make
a
major
contribution
i
know
i
could
have
provide
some
vital
input
into
the
direction
of
our
country
but
it
wasn
t
meant
to
be
i
ve
never
once
regret
run
it
be
something
i
have
to
do
i
believe
all
of
us
from
time
to
time
have
to
look
in
the
mirror
and
decide
what
the
right
thing
to
do
be
even
if
it
mean
have
sometimes
to
swim
against
the
current
never
second
guess
over
the
course
of
my
career
once
i
reach
a
conclusion
once
i
analyze
something
and
weigh
the
pro
and
con
i
come
to
a
decision
and
didn
t
turn
back
too
many
people
after
they
ve
make
a
decision
begin
to
waffle
and
second
guess
you
ve
get
to
go
through
some
soul
search
and
careful
analysis
but
once
you
ve
make
up
your
mind
and
make
a
commitment
move
forward
and
follow
through
otherwise
you
can
never
achieve
anything
chapter
magna
on
the
brink
i
ve
never
see
a
company
go
broke
if
it
have
money
in
the
bank
and
no
debt
with
all
my
year
of
business
experience
i
should
have
know
well
i
should
have
see
it
come
in
the
lead
up
to
the
election
and
during
the
campaign
i
take
my
eye
off
the
ball
and
by
the
time
i
realize
how
bad
thing
be
it
be
too
late
magna
be
head
for
a
financial
meltdown
the
day
after
my
election
defeat
i
get
up
very
early
and
go
into
the
office
i
hadn
t
slept
well
that
night
so
many
thought
be
go
through
my
head
i
be
disappointed
no
question
i
truly
believe
i
could
have
make
a
great
contribution
to
the
country
i
wasn
t
bitter
as
much
as
i
be
perplexed
why
didn
t
the
voter
elect
the
more
experienced
candidate
it
hurt
but
i
be
still
pretty
philosophical
about
it
sometimes
thing
happen
for
a
reason
even
if
that
reason
be
not
apparent
at
the
time
as
it
turn
out
magna
need
me
a
lot
more
than
the
parliament
of
canada
do
magna
have
just
ridden
one
of
the
big
boom
in
company
history
a
time
of
unparalleled
growth
when
we
be
opening
a
new
factory
nearly
every
month
in
we
have
hit
the
billion
sale
mark
and
magna
be
the
golden
boy
of
the
auto
part
business
develop
innovative
new
product
that
help
our
customer
cut
cost
while
boost
sale
by
the
end
of
the
decade
magna
be
produce
approximately
different
component
at
more
than
factory
and
have
sale
of
close
to
billion
they
be
heady
time
but
storm
cloud
begin
to
appear
on
the
horizon
even
before
my
run
for
office
to
fuel
magna
s
explosive
growth
the
company
have
invest
billion
in
new
facility
equipment
and
technology
during
a
five
year
period
that
begin
in
and
then
black
monday
struck
october
when
stock
market
around
the
world
crashed
shred
billion
of
dollar
of
value
in
publicly
trade
stock
as
the
year
wound
down
north
american
vehicle
production
begin
decline
dramatically
magna
meanwhile
be
caught
in
the
middle
of
an
aggressive
capital
expenditure
program
to
keep
pace
with
customer
requirement
for
new
product
we
be
borrowing
heavily
to
finance
our
growth
and
the
company
s
bank
fed
debt
begin
to
swell
soon
after
the
election
i
start
call
in
all
of
our
senior
executive
and
ask
a
lot
of
question
it
have
be
about
nine
month
since
i
have
step
down
as
ceo
i
want
to
get
my
bearing
but
it
didn
t
take
long
before
i
start
to
develop
a
deep
deep
concern
a
lot
of
the
factory
be
young
start
ups
and
hemorrhage
cash
the
financial
statement
didn
t
lie
we
be
bleeding
everywhere
so
i
assemble
a
small
team
of
loyal
lieutenant
people
who
be
highly
skilled
in
certain
area
people
i
could
count
on
to
help
turn
thing
around
we
have
to
cut
back
but
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
be
to
start
swing
an
axe
i
be
go
to
slice
out
the
fat
and
excess
with
surgical
precision
we
have
undergone
enormous
growth
and
when
you
grow
that
quickly
you
get
a
little
sloppy
thing
start
fall
through
the
gap
in
retrospect
our
management
team
be
fairly
young
and
i
left
too
much
on
their
plate
we
have
become
financially
undisciplined
we
have
over
factory
and
many
of
our
manager
be
go
over
budget
they
likely
thought
magna
s
a
big
company
so
what
s
a
million
buck
but
million
time
more
than
factory
quickly
add
up
and
every
time
i
go
to
a
board
meeting
our
overall
budget
be
up
another
million
while
many
of
the
new
order
we
have
book
have
not
yet
go
into
production
before
you
knew
it
our
debt
total
more
than
billion
our
debt
wasn
t
the
only
thing
that
have
balloon
so
too
have
our
overhead
i
recall
visit
a
few
of
our
new
group
head
office
and
i
be
stun
when
i
walk
into
the
building
sleek
marble
floor
stylish
art
hang
on
the
wall
extravagant
stone
waterfall
in
the
lobby
and
luxurious
boardroom
table
make
of
rosewood
that
cost
my
base
salary
at
the
time
they
make
the
magna
head
office
look
mickey
mouse
by
comparison
by
this
time
i
have
obtain
a
clearer
picture
of
where
we
stood
the
company
look
like
a
war
zone
with
fire
burning
everywhere
as
the
head
of
magna
i
gather
together
the
group
president
and
laid
down
the
law
tell
them
that
i
be
go
to
direct
the
traffic
until
we
clean
up
the
mess
and
dug
ourselves
out
of
the
hole
we
be
in
they
immediately
begin
grumble
and
dig
in
their
heel
these
weren
t
button
down
corporate
executive
use
to
toe
the
company
line
they
be
iron
will
entrepreneur
guy
who
always
call
the
shot
prior
to
the
crisis
they
have
have
a
long
leash
and
a
lot
of
power
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
take
everything
away
a
lot
of
them
didn
t
like
it
and
they
push
back
i
want
one
of
my
best
group
president
to
come
into
the
head
office
and
ride
shotgun
with
me
i
need
him
close
by
so
i
could
send
him
into
the
plant
to
put
out
the
fire
that
be
rag
everywhere
but
he
refuse
a
former
toolmaker
he
have
risen
through
the
rank
the
last
thing
he
want
to
do
be
go
back
to
the
factory
floor
and
troubleshoot
production
issue
so
he
quit
the
factory
manager
however
be
solidly
behind
us
they
be
sick
of
see
a
pile
of
their
profit
get
eat
up
by
the
elaborate
overhead
at
the
group
office
they
be
magna
shareholder
too
and
they
want
the
share
to
go
back
up
no
one
be
happier
to
see
us
slash
the
waste
and
sell
off
all
the
fancy
trapping
it
wasn
t
just
the
bloat
overhead
that
be
a
problem
we
be
start
to
stray
from
the
principle
that
have
make
magna
great
such
as
our
decentralize
operating
structure
that
kept
the
factory
close
to
their
customer
in
the
early
day
our
customer
use
to
send
us
a
blueprint
and
we
bash
out
or
mould
the
part
by
the
hundred
of
thousand
and
then
ship
them
to
the
assembly
plant
but
to
remain
competitive
with
the
japanese
the
big
three
be
increasingly
shed
a
lot
of
the
design
and
prototyping
cost
cost
that
supplier
have
to
shoulder
if
they
want
to
keep
their
business
our
small
operating
division
be
not
individually
capable
of
support
all
these
service
on
their
own
and
as
a
result
most
of
these
activity
be
house
in
our
group
office
the
pressure
to
become
a
full
service
supplier
with
design
engineering
and
prototyping
capability
have
lead
to
the
growth
of
highly
centralize
group
office
the
opposite
of
the
decentralize
policy
that
be
the
hallmark
of
magna
s
early
success
before
long
we
start
look
like
the
traditional
type
of
centralize
corporation
that
we
swore
we
would
never
become
and
then
it
happen
in
early
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
bad
automotive
industry
downturn
in
decade
with
our
company
seriously
overextend
with
the
stock
price
slide
and
sale
stagnate
we
default
on
certain
debt
to
equity
ratio
laid
down
by
the
bank
as
a
condition
of
the
money
they
have
lent
to
help
finance
our
growth
debt
have
climbed
to
billion
by
early
magna
s
stock
meanwhile
tumble
from
approximately
in
to
a
low
of
in
the
second
quarter
of
we
have
go
from
be
a
blue
chip
investment
to
something
that
more
closely
resemble
a
penny
stock
my
main
worry
be
whether
or
not
the
bank
would
pull
the
trigger
and
shut
us
down
with
each
passing
day
there
be
more
and
more
financial
vulture
circle
the
company
hop
to
tear
off
the
best
piece
and
gobble
up
magna
the
bank
brought
in
a
bankruptcy
specialist
from
one
of
the
big
accounting
firm
at
the
time
it
be
a
cold
grey
march
day
in
and
we
be
call
to
an
important
meeting
at
office
in
downtown
toronto
i
didn
t
know
it
at
the
time
but
in
the
loom
showdown
with
the
bank
it
be
high
noon
the
bankruptcy
specialist
fire
the
first
shot
he
ask
me
to
hand
over
my
control
block
of
share
in
effect
he
be
demand
that
i
give
up
control
of
magna
i
saw
it
as
a
naked
power
grab
pure
and
simple
i
say
who
be
you
talk
to
be
you
nut
be
you
out
of
your
mind
i
rarely
swear
and
never
in
a
business
meeting
but
i
do
that
day
i
told
them
they
would
basically
have
to
shoot
me
first
in
order
to
wrest
away
control
of
my
voting
bloc
of
share
either
that
or
drive
the
company
into
bankruptcy
i
told
them
that
we
would
all
go
under
before
i
would
give
up
control
of
the
company
i
wasn
t
bluffing
perhaps
they
underestimated
how
much
the
company
meant
to
me
i
say
there
s
no
way
you
guy
be
gonna
run
the
place
there
wasn
t
a
hope
in
hell
that
i
would
ever
hand
over
control
because
if
i
have
do
so
you
could
have
kiss
magna
goodbye
that
would
have
be
the
end
i
make
it
quite
clear
if
the
company
go
into
a
hold
trust
the
whole
enterprise
will
go
down
the
drain
believe
me
i
didn
t
enjoy
the
brinkmanship
i
know
some
business
people
do
but
not
me
it
be
not
my
style
look
back
these
many
year
later
i
realize
now
how
close
we
come
to
lose
it
all
in
the
end
cooler
head
prevail
the
bank
do
the
calculation
and
they
knew
that
the
probability
of
us
pay
back
our
loan
be
fairly
good
they
decide
it
be
well
to
tough
out
the
restructuring
with
me
still
in
the
saddle
nevertheless
they
dealt
with
us
severely
we
paid
enormous
penalty
in
the
ten
of
million
of
dollar
the
banker
come
to
our
head
office
and
walk
through
the
hall
as
if
they
have
already
take
possession
of
the
title
deed
we
be
at
their
mercy
and
we
have
to
give
them
weekly
update
on
our
cash
flow
and
debt
position
the
truth
be
the
bank
could
have
call
the
loan
they
could
have
force
us
into
bankruptcy
have
we
go
under
it
would
have
left
a
great
gash
across
the
belly
of
the
canadian
economy
across
the
entire
north
american
automotive
industry
by
that
point
we
have
become
such
a
major
player
in
the
industry
that
i
m
convince
the
big
three
would
have
step
in
and
say
hang
on
you
can
t
let
magna
go
under
as
it
turn
out
our
customer
be
the
first

to
our
aid
they
accelerate
their
payment
to
us
they
be
practically
pay
us
the
day
we
ship
the
product
when
normally
we
would
have
have
to
wait
thirty
or
sixty
day
so
we
immediately
juiced
up
our
cash
flow
during
the
crisis
magna
ceo
fred
gingl
be
our
point
man
when
it
come
to
deal
with
our
customer
the

want
to
pin
the
blame
on

they
be
also
worried
that
he
wasn
t
the
right
guy
to
cut
chop
downsize
and
sell
after
all
he
have
preside
over
a
long
stretch
of
growth
when

i
told
him
that
the
bank

to
push
him
out
and
he
say
frank

you
have
to
do
to
turn
the
company
around
if
that
s
what
it
take
so
be
it
while
we
be
able
to
get
our
customer
to
accelerate
payment
we
do
the
reverse
with
our
supplier
we
ask
them
if
we
could
pay
in
sixty
day
or
in
many
case
ninety
day
those
who
refuse
we
stop
do
business
with
the
head
of
our
human
resource
department
met
with
the
account
representative
from
one
of
our
employee
benefit
and
insurance
supplier
during
that
time
we
spell
out
our
situation
and
say
look
can
you
help
us
can
you
cut
us
some
slack
until
we
get
back
on
our
foot
the
account
representative
respond
by
say
they
unfortunately
have
to
jack
up
our
rate
my
executive
take
the
account
rep
s
business
card
tore
it
into
small
piece
and
threw
the
piece
across
the
boardroom
table
at
him
we
be
fight
for
our
life
and
you
be
either
with
us
or
against
us
i
have
a
lot
of
pride
on
the
line
i
d
pour
my
life
s
energy
into
that
company
for
thirty
year
and
i
be
watch
everything
go
down
the
drain
i
also
couldn
t
face
the
prospect
of
see
thousand
of
employee
lose
their
job
and
what
bother
me
most
of
all
be
this
that
people
would
say
the
magna
culture
stronach
create
doesn
t
work
i
believe
in
that
culture
with
every
ounce
of
my
be
when
our
cfo
jim
mcalpine
resign
the
bank
start
to
get
really
nervous
they
be
push
hard
to
sell
as
much
as
possible
they
want
me
to
cherry
pick
our
best
division
and
group
and
unload
them
for
a
fast
profit
i
say
look
if
i
sell
off
our
best
division
how
be
we
go
to
generate
profit
we
ll
be
left
with
the
underperform
and
old
division
and
there
s
no
way
the
company
will
survive
the
bank
have
a
single
mind
focus
on
cover
their
exposure
by
pay
off
the
loan
as
quickly
as
possible
but
magna
s
shareholder
and
employee
would
have
be
left
hold
the
bag
i
have
to
buy
time
so
i
stall
and
drag
my
foot
but
all
the
while
they
be
put
intense
heat
on
me
frank
when
be
you
go
to
sell
this
what
s
take
so
long
i
wasn
t
deal
with
my
counterpart
at
the
bank
who
might
have
take
a
big
picture
view
i
be
deal
with
a
lot
of
mid
level
executive
who
be
probably
think
we
ve
get
this
bigshot
businessman
by
the
ball
he
s
on
his
knee
now
and
during
the
meeting
i
have
to
sit
there
and
listen
to
their
criticism
and
occasional
lecture
along
the
line
of
this
isn
t
your
business
to
run
any
longer
frank
this
be
now
our
business
you
screw
up
be
there
resentment
toward
me
i
certainly
felt
so
and
perhaps
in
part
it
be
because
i
be
always
so
vocal
always
give
speech
and
interview
about
my
view
of
how
business
should
operate
how
fair
enterprise
could
make
business
more
productive
i
have
no
doubt
some
of
the
wasp
establishment
guy
be
glad
to
see
me
fall
a
few
peg
look
at
the
smarta
immigrant
now
we
ll
teach
him
a
thing
or
two
in
hindsight
i
be
perhaps
too
outspoken
i
come
across
as
somewhat
cocky
a
bit
of
a
smart
aleck
it
wasn
t
the
canadian
way
but
there
be
no
point
in
get
angry
i
have
only
one
objective
to
patch
up
the
leak
in
the
sinking
ship
and
get
it
head
back
in
the
right
direction
and
all
the
while
i
be
comfort
by
the
thought
that
the
banker
would
never
put
us
under
if
we
be
make
money
and
pay
back
the
loan
but
i
have
to
buy
some
time
to
get
our
young
division
make
money
we
have
two
division
that
be
spray
red
ink
and
we
move
quickly
to
shut
them
down
one
be
a
start
up
joint
venture
that
make
aluminum
wheel
a
product
line
where
we
do
not
have
prior
expertise
we
lose
more
than
million
in
one
year
alone
it
be
about
a
third
of
our
total
operating
loss
another
be
a
joint
venture
with
a
japanese
company
that
make
plastic
bumper
it
be
a
disaster
and
be
lose
about
the
same
amount
of
money
between
the
two
joint
venture
they
represent
most
of
what
we
be
lose
we
basically
sell
our
interest
in
the
japanese
joint
venture
for
a
buck
just
to
get
it
off
our
balance
sheet
but
the
situation
be
never
as
bad
as
it
look
from
the
outside
we
have
highly
efficient
factory
most
of
which
be
state
of
the
art
we
have
loyal
long
time
customer
who
do
not
flinch
and
who
stood
by
us
and
we
have
fiercely
commit
employee
what
s
more
the
company
still
have
strong
cash
flow
as
well
as
a
lot
of
prime
real
estate
that
we
sell
to
pay
down
debt
during
the
s
and
s
we
have
scoop
up
thousand
of
acre
of
farmland
north
of
toronto
in
markham
richmond
hill
and
vaughan
the
mushroom
suburban
municipality
that
border
the
city
many
of
our
factory
be
locate
in
these
community
so
we
be
always
hunt
for
land
on
which
to
build
future
factory
we
be
sometimes
accuse
by
investor
and
others
of
land
banking
put
company
money
into
non
automotive
asset
that
weren
t
return
a
profit
and
we
get
a
lot
of
flak
for
it
but
over
time
the
value
of
those
property
skyrocket
more
than
quadruple
our
initial
investment
so
we
start
sell
the
property
to
pay
off
the
debt
net
about
million
cash
the
financial
press
meanwhile
make
it
seem
that
magna
be
go
to
fall
like
a
house
of
card
there
be
no
question
we
be
in
deep
but
the
medium
overdramatize
the
situation
the
press
help
cement
the
perception
that
magna
be
all
over
the
map
that
we
have
invest
in
a
bunch
of
money
lose
business
outside
our
core
auto
part
business
and
that
this
be
the
reason
for
our
downfall
but
the
truth
be
those
non
automotive
asset
everything
from
a
business
magazine
to
a
restaurant
be
a
minute
fraction
of
what
we
own
nevertheless
the
medium
latch
onto
them
and
blew
them
way
out
of
proportion
a
number
of
industry
analyst
question
whether
magna
would
survive
i
work
day
and
night
with
a
special
management
team
to
restructure
the
company
and
restore
its
financial
health
magna
s
lead
director
bill
davis
together
with
fellow
board
member
ed
lumley
and
don
resnick
be
there
for
me
through
the
entire
crisis
as
trust
advisor
and
sound
board
particularly
when
it
come
to
craft
a
plan
to
claw
our
way
out
of
debt
they
be
a
rock
i
could
count
on
magna
issue
a
preliminary
debt
restructuring
plan
that
mapped
out
how
we
be
go
to
start
pay
back
our
bank
loan
then
in
the
first
quarter
of
miraculously
we
post
a
small
profit
which
some
wall
street
analyst
described
as
nothing
short
of
stun
as
part
of
the
debt
restructuring
plan
we
also
secure
a
bridge
loan
to
help
us
with
our
cash
flow
the
banker
want
me
to
put
some
skin
in
the
game
so
i
put
up
my
own
home
to
help
secure
the
loan
then
in
the
spring
the
company
succeed
in
raise
a
million
convertible
bond
issue
to
help
pay
down
debt
and
by
the
end
of
that
year
magna
be
off
life
support
i
publicly
pledge
that
magna
would
refocus
on
the
core
principle
and
operating
philosophy
that
make
it
successful
and
i
promise
that
the
company
would
never
again
take
on
excessive
debt
it
marked
the
begin
of
magna
s
remarkable
recovery
and
re
emergence
as
one
of
the
pre
eminent
auto
supplier
in
the
world
share
price
sale
and
profit
all
begin
to
climb
to
new
record
level
in
the
year
that
follow
but
what
i
be
most
proud
of
be
that
the
turnaround
wasn
t
engineer
on
the
back
of
our
worker
over
the
course
of
the
entire
financial
crisis
very
few
factory
floor
worker
be
laid
off
on
top
of
that
i
make
sure
that
magna
worker
who
retire
during
the
crisis
didn
t
bear
the
brunt
of
our
stock
s
collapse
employee
receive
magna
stock
as
part
of
our
profit
and
equity
share
plan
and
for
many
of
them
this
be
the
bulk
of
their
retirement
saving
when
magna
s
share
price
plunge
below
employee
near
retirement
saw
the
value
of
their
stock
holding
evaporate
and
it
be
devastate
it
wasn
t
fair
especially
to
our
old
worker
i
felt
we
have
an
obligation
to
look
after
them
since
they
have
be
with
us
for
so
many
year
and
then
through
no
fault
of
their
own
they
get
squeeze
by
a
vicious
downturn
so
we
topped
up
the
value
of
the
share
for
all
those
who
retire
during
the
crisis
by
magna
be
back
on
its
foot
again
financially
magna
s
total
debt
fell
to
less
than
million
the
company
s
stock
be
list
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
magna
s
share
price
begin
to
climb
back
up
into
the
mid
range
it
be
call
one
of
the
great
turnaround
in
canadian
corporate
history
we
have
walk
a
very
thin
line
between
recovery
and
ruin
i
have
come
close
to
lose
the
entire
business
try
to
keep
the
company
afloat
while
pay
down
the
debt
be
like
swim
with
a
big
cement
block
tie
around
our
ankle
but
we
persevere
and
we
succeed
in
slash
debt
much
faster
than
anyone
thought
possible
it
be
a
traumatic
experience
one
i
will
never
forget
i
vowed
that
magna
would
never
again
take
on
a
large
amount
of
debt
or
borrow
a
lot
of
money
from
the
bank
as
long
as
i
remain
at
the
helm
i
kept
that
vow
we
ran
a
very
tight
ship
and
gradually
built
up
our
cash
reserve
which
stood
at
well
over
billion
when
i
step
down
as
chairman
in
during
the
past
decade
some
shareholder
and
stock
analyst
have
urge
us
to
expand
more
aggressively
by
borrowing
money
or
burning
through
our
cash
reserve
but
we
steadfastly
resist
go
down
that
road
i
still
bore
the
scar
tissue
from
our
brush
with
bankruptcy
in
the
early
s
when
the
economic
meltdown
of
sent
the
auto
industry
into
a
tailspin
we
be
able
to
weather
the
storm
while
a
lot
of
our
highly
leveraged
competitor
go
under
pull
down
by
the
crush
weight
of
debt
i
have
learn
a
harsh
lesson
nearly
twenty
year
earlier
and
it
save
our
company
from
the
financial
hurricane
that
wipe
out

of
auto

to
japan
the
nation
that
be
quickly
but
quietly
emerge
as
an
automotive
powerhouse
it
be
the
late
s
and
during
my
travel
across
the
country
i
have
an
opportunity
to
visit
a
traditional
japanese
silk
farm
i
be
amaze
to
see
the
silkworm
feed
on
mulberry
bush
and
spin
the
spectacular
strand
of
silk
use
to
make
fine
clothing
and
other
material
my
guide
explain
that
the
operation
be
go
to
shut
down
because
it
could
no
longer
compete
against
the
synthetic
silk
producer
that
be
grab
a
large
and
large
share
of
the
market
human
ingenuity
be
what
it
be
someone
have
figure
out
a
way
to
make
a
product
as
good
or
well
than
mother
nature
s
and
at
a
much
low
cost
it
be
for
me
a
vivid
lesson
in
how
entire
industry
can
be
wipe
out
overnight
by
technological
advance
or
sudden
change
in
the
economic
landscape
business
have
to
continually
adapt
to
these
shift
economic
condition
whether
they
be
change
brought
about
by
technological
innovation
or
change
unleashed
by
force
such
as
deregulation
and
globalization
so
it
be
for
us
at
magna
by
the
early
s
i
could
see
the
enormous
trend
toward
a
global
economy
begin
to
take
shape
it
be
a
tsunami
that
would
sweep
up
every
industry
in
its
path
and
the
auto
world
be
no
exception
at
the
time
magna
be
mainly
a
north
american
company
with
only
five
plant
in
europe
and
annual
sale
in
europe
of
just
over
million
but
for
me
the
write
be
on
wall
if
we
want
to
survive
the
come
tsunami
we
have
no
option
but
to
grow
globally
and
swell
our
customer
base
beyond
north
america
so
in
i
announce
plan
to
launch
and
lead
a
major
expansion
in
europe
the
massive
european
market
be
home
to
many
of
the
world
s
lead
automaker
company
such
as
volkswagen
mercedes
benz
bmw
renault
fiat
and
volvo
my
heritage
and
the
heritage
of
many
of
our
top
manager
be
austrian
and
german
we
knew
the
language
the
custom
the
culture
it
be
our
old
stomp
ground
so
it
give
us
a
competitive
edge
over
other
north
american
firm
look
to
set
up
shop
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
be
spending
more
than
half
the
year
in
europe
initially
in
zug
switzerland
and
soon
after
at
magna
s
new
european
headquarters
i
plant
the
magna
corporate
flag
at
a
year
old
castle
in
the
village
of
oberwaltersdorf
on
the
outskirt
of
vienna
it
be
to
be
the
launch
ground
the
nerve
centre
for
our
european
expansion
shortly
after
we
open
the
headquarters
we
invite
the
resident
of
the
village
to
the
ground
of
the

for
our
official
opening
they
come
to
hear
the
live
music
to
sample
the

grill
sausage
and
they
come
to
see
one
of
their
fellow
countryman
a

auto
industry
by
the
middle
of
the
decade
magna
be

throughout
europe
but
unlike
the
previous
decade
when
we
grow
by

ground
up
we
expand

mainly
by
buying
exist
supplier
we
hunt

open
the
door
to
new
customer
or
company
that
have
unique
technology
or
make
part
we
weren
t
make
in
north
america
essentially
we
set
out
to
replicate
the
company
that
exist
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
ocean
but
instead
of
do
it
over
three
decade

of
magna
s
first
acquisition
be

on
it
go
a
string
of
acquisition
at
a
pace
that
put
us
on
a
path
to
become
one
of
the

we
later
decide
to
pull
out
of
when
we
hit
it
big

a
new

s
what
i
told
a

owner

at

board

meeting
back
in
the

start
to
expand

it
s
a
phrase
i
still
use
to
this
day
because
it
s
a
phrase
that
for
me
capture
the
essence
of
globalization
the
core
philosophy
behind
the
relentless
force
that
be
reshape
entire
country
and
economy
globalization
basically
allows
corporation
to
go
to
low
cost
country
and
ship
product
to
richer
more
developed
market
around
the
world
the
plain
fact
be
there
be
much
less
concern
for
social
and
environmental
issue
in
most
of
these
low
cost
country
than
there
be
in
the
west
with
the
result
that
corporation
can
manufacture
good
there
at
a
much
low
cost
but
in
the
long
run
if
this
trend
continue
society
in
the
west
will
see
a
decline
in
living
standard
in
the
last
few
year
i
have
become
increasingly
alarmed
and
worried
by
the
rapid
deterioration
of
the
manufacturing
base
here
in
the
west
wherever
i
go
in
western
europe
and
north
america
i
see
more
and
more
warehouse
and
few
and
few
factory
and
you
don
t
have
to
be
a
great
economist
to
know
why
we
be
manufacturing
and
export
few
product
and
instead
import
a
great
number
of
good
produce
elsewhere
everything
from
toy
and
tv
to
cell
phone
and
computer
just
walk
down
the
aisle
of
any
major
department
store
provide
a
startle
reminder
that
very
few
product
be
make
in
the
west
even
the
fruit
and
vegetable
we
eat
be
increasingly
grown
in
other
country
and
ship
in
in
the
final
analysis
when
a
country
import
more
and
more
and
export
less
and
less
it
will
only
be
a
matter
of
time
before
the
economic
fabric
begin
to
unravel
and
the
living
standard
of
its
people
deteriorates
to
spur
the
creation
of
new
job
here
in
the
west
as
well
as
keep
the
job
we
currently
have
our
number
one
priority
should
be
to
stimulate
great
manufacturing
and
production
in
order
to
generate
more
export
one
of
the
reason
for
the
decline
in
manufacturing
in
north
america
and
europe
be
that
the
current
tax
system
in
most
country
do
not
provide
financial
incentive
to
invest
in
a
company
s
home
country
on
the
contrary
western
company
reap
great
financial
reward
by
lay
off
worker
and
outsource
production
to
foreign
country
that
have
low
social
safety
and
environmental
standard
in
essence
we
re
reward
company
that
exterminate
job
that
must
change
business
that
invest
all
of
their
net
profit
in
the
country
they
be
locate
in
should
be
exempt
from
pay
any
tax
whatsoever
if
we
do
that
we
would
unleash
an
economic
boom
on
a
massive
scale
make
no
mistake
we
re
engage
in
economic
warfare
with
country
that
have
clearly
define
and
closely
coordinate
economic
strategy
while
most
country
in
the
west
lack
industrial
strategy
a
grow
number
of
ravenous
and
aggressive
competitor
abroad
have
clearly
focus
and
well
developed
plan
to
make
their
key
business
or
national
champion
the
dominant
player
in
each
of
the
key
economic
sector
with
the
automotive
industry
be
a
prime
target
the
best
example
of
a
country
with
this
sort
of
strategic
approach
be
china
the
world
s
new
industrial
giant
i
ve
always
be
a
big
believer
that
a
company
should
locate
a
portion
of
its
manufacturing
operation
in
the
various
market
where
its
product
be
sell
but
many
western
company
be
only
manufacturing
in
china
so
they
can
ship
product
back
into
their
home
market
in
order
to
make
high
profit
and
in
the
process
they
re
erode
the
economy
of
the
country
where
they
re
headquarter
it
s
a
formula
for
national
economic
suicide
the
global
economy
be
spin
faster
and
faster
with
each
passing
year
and
country
in
the
west
need
to
find
new
and
well
way
to
remain
globally
competitive
job
be
the
most
precious
commodity
in
the
world
and
in
an
effort
to
raise
the
living
standard
of
their
people
country
everywhere
will
fight
tooth
and
nail
to
lure
those
job
to
their
shore
but
it
s
the
lean
and
shrewdest
country
the
one
with
the
low
overhead
and
the
low
tax
that
will
win
the
lion
s
share
of
new
job
this
century
i
believe
one
surefire
solution
to
reignite
economic
growth
in
the
west
be
to
reverse
the
enormous
trend
toward
financial
engineering
and
service
and
instead
return
to
our
once
proud
manufacturing
tradition
our
economy
grow
strong
by
make
the
kind
of
product
the
rest
of
the
world
want
product
that
improve
life
and
help
generate
new
wealth
it
be
only
through
focus
once
again
on
make
thing
innovative
new
product
that
combine
the
very
best
in
our
knowledge
of
new
material
and
technology
with
our
most
advanced
engineering
and
design
skill
that
we
ll
be
able
to
create
the
job
of
the
future
i
also
think
we
re
reach
a
tip
point
and
will
soon
enter
a
new
era
when
blue
collar
worker
people
who
can
build
thing
people
who
can
fix
thing
will
make
more
money
than

i
remember
when
the
economic
meltdown
hit
financial
market
in
late
send
the
north
american
automotive
industry
into
a
tailspin
that
would
lead
to
chrysler
and
general
motor
filing
for
bankruptcy
hundred
of
thousand
of
job
in
the
auto
industry
be
incinerate
almost
overnight
magna
through
absolutely
no
fault
of
our
own
have
to
lay
off
a
number
of
good
employee
as
a
result
of
the
economic
collapse
it
be
a
sad
shame
a
real
heartbreaker
many
of
those
worker
have
be
with
us
for
more
than
thirty
year
assembly
line
all
over
north
america
and
europe
shut
down
and
when
vehicle
aren
t
roll
off
the
line
the
factory
of
auto
part
supplier
such
as
magna
grind
to
a
halt
as
well
magna
sale
plunge
by
nearly
percent
a
year
over
year
drop
of
more
than
billion
but
it
wasn
t
through
any
fault
on
the
part
of
magna
management
the
management
team
be
run
a
tight
ship
we
have
healthy
profit
margin
strong
sale
about
a
billion
dollar
cash
sit
in
the
bank
and
then
the
economic
tsunami
hit
there
s
an
old
say
in
the
auto
business
we
re
the
first
one
to
go
into
a
recession
and
the
first
one
to
come
out
this
time
be
no
different
except
we
go
in
hard
and
we
go
in
headfirst
it
be
the
severest
industry
downturn
i
have
ever
see
go
back
to
the
day
when
we
first
start
make
auto
part
for
penny
a
piece
i
didn
t
think
it
be
fair
that
our
senior
management
team
take
a
huge
hit
in
pay
when
they
have
manage
the
company
well
so
i
decline
my
bonus
and
ask
that
it
be
share
among
the
other
senior
executive
at
magna
i
didn
t
expect
to
get
a
medal
or
a
slap
on
the
back
but
the
year
before
when
i
make
over
million
in
profit
share
when
the
auto
industry
be
hum
i
get
rake
over
the
coal
by
the
financial
press
yet
in
when
the
same
wall
street
banker
that
trigger
the
crisis
be
pull
down
bonus
that
approach
billion
no
mention
be
make
in
the
medium
of
the
fact
that
i
rescind
my
bonus
the
meltdown
be
an
economic
crisis
trigger
by
financial
market
in
the
u
s
that
have
run
wild
with
financial
institution
operating
more
like
casino
than
bank
at
our
annual
meeting
of
shareholder
the
follow
year
i
ask
how
be
it
that
wall
street
be
make
more
money
annually
than
the
combine
revenue
of
both
the
manufacturing

agricultural

clearly
there
be
something
wrong
with
the

when
the

disintegrate

too
do
the

piece
of

i
believe
one
of
the
trigger
of
the
meltdown
be
the
fact
that
we
have
drift
away
from
a

economy
where
we
manufacture
product
to
a
financial

an
economy

where
you
have

more

and
shuffle

but
you
can
t
build

with

and
you
can
t

we
ve
become
less

less
preoccupy
with
create
real
wealth
and
more
and
more
engage
in
the
process
of
transfer
and
redistribute
the
decline
wealth
that
we
do
generate
we
need
to
be
careful
that
we
don
t
dismantle
our
farm
and
factory
and
end
up
import
everything
from
abroad
the
implication
of
this
deterioration
be
critical
a
decline
in

will
lead
to
a
decline

application
not

in

also
in

around

at
the

of
the
day
the
continued
deterioration
of
the

in
north
america
and
europe
will
eventually
impact
a
wide
range
of
other

and
it
will
rob
us
of

of

innovation
if
we
continue

never

we
will
experience
a
decline
in

with
it
our
high
standard
of
living
and
we
will
lose
a
good
measure
of
our
economic
independence
to
make
matter
bad
follow
the
economic
meltdown
government
around
the
world
have
be
pump
trillion
of
dollar
into
the
world
economy
to
keep
it
afloat
all
of
this
have
be
do
with
borrow
money
and
government
have
show
little
or
no
inclination
to
curb
their
spending
this
borrowing
and
subsequent
build
up
of
debt
be
mask
the
real
economic
decline
that
be
take
place
all
around
us
our

our

be
increasingly
propped
up
with
borrow
money
at
magna
over
twenty
year
ago
i
experienced
first
hand
how
destructive

can
be
it
s
a
creep
sickness
that
be
painless
and
virtually
invisible
at
first
but
by
the
time
its
cancerous
effect
be
fully
felt
it
s
often
too
late
to
recover
and
regain
economic
health
one
of
the
hard
truth
that
history
teach
us
be
that
society
come
and
go
the
world
never
stand
still
and
society
no
matter
how
great
how
large
or
how
powerful
be
all
subject
to
the
same
unstoppable
evolutionary
change
when
the
economic
fabric
start
to
unravel
every
other
aspect
of

follow
i
worry
that
unless
we
correct
the
problem
that
lead

the
last

and
unless
we
severely
curtail
the

year
we
may
face
an
even
great
financial

it
s

chapter
what
s
wrong
with
the
automotive
industry
you
ve
get
to
motivate
employee
to
not
only
work
hard
but
also
to
think
and
they
ll
only
think
if
their
heart
be
in
the
business
if
you
don
t
win
the
heart
of
employee
there
s
no
way
you
can
be
successful
the
economic
meltdown
that
begin
in
the
u
s
in
and
spread
around
the
world
hit
the
automotive
industry
harder
than
perhaps
any
other
sector
the
downturn
expose
a
lot
of
crack
and
rust
that
have
remain
hidden
when
time
be
good
and
the
car
company
be
flush
with
profit
it
be
an
opportunity
for
us
not
only
to
revitalize
the
ail
automotive
industry
but
to
fundamentally
rethink
the
way
we
make
car
so
what
do
we
need
to
change
to
begin
with
our
automotive
assembly
plant
be
massive
facility
where
employee
be
treat
not
much
differently
from
the
robot
that
work
alongside
them
the
gigantic
car
factory
of
the
past
century
be
dinosaur
and
the
sooner
the
industry
abandon
that
model
the
well
off
it
will
be
we
need
to
stop
stuff
ten
of
thousand
of
employee
into
large
impersonal
assembly
facility
that
become
breeding
ground
for
discontent
every
employee
see
the
world
from
his
or
her
own
point
of
view
but
when
you
have
thousand
of
employee
under
one
roof
with
hundred
of
rule
it
s
hard
to
connect
and
communicate
the
manager
and
foreman
barely
know
the
worker
people
become
number
we
need
to
develop
small
leaner
more
flexible
facility
with
no
more
than
employee
there
be
no
reason
why
all
of
the
automotive
module
that
make
up
a
vehicle
the
large
pre
assemble
chunk
of
the
car
cannot
be
produce
in
small
feeder
factory
and
then
ship
to
facility
with
few
people
do
the
final
assembly
these
modular
piece
of
the
car
whole
transmission
and
drivetrains
dashboard
and
cockpit
should
be
design
and
manufacture
to
interlock
and
click
together
like
lego
block
the
car
company
be
move
that
way
but
they
need
to
get
there
much
faster
second
we
need
to
create
a
new
model
of
industrial
cooperation
between
management
and
labour
that
will
ensure
the
long
term
competitiveness
of
the
industry
it
s
no
secret
that
one
of
the
chief
problem
confront
a
large
part
of
the
automotive
industry
be
the
entrench
adversarial
and
confrontational
condition
that
exist
between
labour
and
business
i
believe
that
most
autoworkers
would
support
move
to
eliminate
the
policy
and
structure
that
keep
management
and
labour
constantly
at
each
other
s
throat
the
ingrain
adversarial
environment
that
dominates
the
industry
remains
the
single
great
impediment
to
produce
quality
car
at
competitive
price
furthermore
the
wage
of
automotive
assembly
worker
must
be
brought
more
in
line
with
the
average
industrial
wage
index
from
the
turn
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
the
glory
year
of
the
s
the
american
auto
industry
face
virtually
no
competition
carmaker
grow
fat
and
inefficient
and
union
demand
high
and
high
wage
management
give
in
to
these
demand
in
large
part
because
they
could
simply
pas
on
the
high
cost
to
consumer
the
result
be
that
the
average
wage
for
automotive
assembly
worker
just
before
the
meltdown
grow
to
about
per
hour
include
benefit
today
it
be
closer
to
per
hour
but
that
amount
be
still
double
the
average
industrial
wage
in
america
of
approximately
per
hour
what
work
for
magna
give
employee
a
cut
of
the
profit
could
also
work
wonder
for
the
automotive
industry
i
strongly
believe
that
if
assembly
line
wage
be
more
in
line
with
the
average
industrial
wage
but
topped
up
with
a
hefty
share
of
the
annual
profit
we
would
sharpen
the
competitiveness
and
productivity
of
the
north
american
automotive
industry
like
never
before
in
with
the
aftershock
of
the
economic
meltdown
still
be
felt
around
the
world
magna
come
within
a
whisker
of
acquire
ownership
in
general
motor
european
car
operation
it
would
have
give
us
an
opportunity
to
apply
some
of
our
fair
enterprise
principle
on
the
vehicle
assembly
line
and
play
a
big
role
in
the
way
that
car
get
make
with
gm
totter
toward
bankruptcy
it
look
fairly
certain
that
their
european
division
adam
opel
ag
would
shut
its
door
after
more
than
a
century
of
make
car
thirty
thousand
job
be
on
the
line
we
get
pull
to
the
negotiate
table
by
the
head
of
the
auto
union
as
well
as
by
general
motor
and
the
german
government
but
magna
have
no
desire
to
completely
take
over
opel
we
be
only
look
for
a
way
to
keep
one
of
our
large
european
customer
afloat
and
maybe
even
grow
its
market
share
beyond
the
border
of
the
european
union
i
thought
that
a
partnership
with
a
russian
car
company
be
the
solution
a
potential
triple
win
situation
russian
consumer
have
great
purchasing
power
and
a
grow
appetite
for
quality
car
and
by
building
opel
vehicle
in
russia
as
well
as
in
germany
we
could
have
spread
the
tool
and
engineering
cost
over
a
high
volume
vehicle
platform
drive
down
the
per
piece
cost
it
would
have
be
good
for
opel
good
for
general
motor
good
for
the
russian
car
industry
and
naturally
good
for
magna
but
when
gm
pocket
billion
in
bailout
money
from
the
u
s
government
they
decide
to
hang
onto
opel
gm
be
our
big
customer
and
as
long
as
i
ve
be
in
business
the
customer
be
always
right
the
car
industry
have
now
arrive
at
a
crossroad
union
have
to
change
and
business
have
to
change
in
the
final
analysis
it
s
about
be
globally
competitive
magna
have
developed
a
new
framework
for
the
way
business
and
labour
relate
to
one
another
an
economic
framework
of
fairness
base
on
social
economic
justice
that
recognizes
and
respect
the
right
of
union
and
company
while
create
an
environment
that
encourages
and
reward
productivity
it
s
a
small
first
step
but
i
believe
something
along
the
line
of
our
framework
of
fairness
can
be
replicate
for
the
benefit
of
the
entire
industry
a
number
of
people
thought
it
be
wrong
for
north
american
and
european
government
to
provide
bailout
money
to
automaker
they
argue
in
favour
of
let
weaken
debt
strap
car
company
go
bankrupt
and
step
in
later
to
put
the
piece
back
together
but
it
would
have
be
too
late
at
that
point
the
aftershock
throughout
the
automotive
supply
chain
and
the
result
economic
damage
would
have
be
massive
million
of
job
in
the
automotive
industry
would
have
be
lose
forever
and
government
would
have
forfeit
hundred
of
billion
of
dollar
in
future
tax
revenue
i
firmly
believe
that
the
consequence
of
allow
the
auto
industry
to
collapse
would
have
shaken
the
very
economic
foundation
of
the
u
s
economy
north
america
wouldn
t
only
have
close
down
assembly
plant
we
would
have
be
boarding
up
shopping
mall
as
well
but
in
the
end
i
believe
we
do
more
than
simply
save
automotive
job
from
disappear
we
begin
lay
the
foundation
that
might
enable
the
north
american
and
european
automotive
industry
to
remain
globally
competitive
in
the
decade
ahead
in
spite
of
the
come
intensified
competition
from
asian
country
such
as
china
and
india
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
industry
squander
a
once
in
a
century
chance
to
truly
restructure
and
rebuild
industry
labour
and
government
leader
need
to
hammer
out
a
new
framework
for
the
twenty
first
century
one
that
will
not
only
save
north
american
auto
job
from
disappear
altogether
but
also
create
new
job
and
enable
the
north

the
latter
part
of

a

austrian
and
lifelong

the
german
army
and
serve
as
an
infantryman
on
the
russian
front
a
communist
at
heart
he
despise
the
nazi
regime
and
sympathize
with
the
russian
the
bleak
year
of
hunger
and
hardship
during
the
depression
and
the
war
cause
many
european
to
turn
toward
the

with
their
promise
of
a
classless
society
and
fairness
for

after
the
fight
end
my
dad
told
me
many
war
story
the
atrocity
he
witness
as
well
as
his
scrape
with
death
and
capture
on
the
battlefield
he
toil
in
factory
most
of
his
life
and
he
fought
on
behalf
of
well
work
condition
and
wage
for
worker
he
be
jail
and
beaten
for
his
belief
i
didn
t
see
it
so
much
at
the
time
as
a
young
boy
but
look
back
now
i
believe
he
be
a
man
of
courage
and
conviction
he
fought
for
human
dignity
for
the
right
of
people
to
be
treat
fairly
and
with
respect
one
of
the
story
my
dad
told
me
one
that
stuck
with
him
all
his
life
be
about
the
time
he
go
knock
on
door
offering
to
work
for
food
a
farmer
give
him
some
chore
to
do
and
when
my
father
finish
the
work
he
be
give
the
farmer
say
to
his
wife
don
t
put
the
food
on
a
plate
put
it
in
the
dog
bowl
shortly
before
my
father
pass
away
he
visit
me
in
toronto
it
be
around
and
my
business
be
grow
i
take
my
father
to
some
of
our
factory
show
him
blueprint
of
new
plant
we
be
go
to
build
i
think
he
be
proud
of
what
his
son
have
accomplish
and
i
know
my
father
if
he
be
alive
today
would
be
proud
of
the
employee
s
charter
of
right
and
other
employee
program
i
create
he
be
a
communist
hardliner
a
marxist
through
and
through
but
i
think
i
be
able
to
soften
his
stance
i
ve
always
say
that
the
original
union
provide
a
great
service
to
society
during
the
early
part
of
the
twentieth
century
union
help
to
bring
about
great
safety
condition
and
great
dignity
in
the
workplace
the
old
school
union
leader
who
fought
for
those
right
who
suffer
beating
with
baseball
bat
and
tire
iron
who
be
imprison
and
sometimes
even
kill
they
be
true
hero
however
i
strongly
disagree
with
the
philosophy
and
attitude
of
most
present
day
union
many
of
which
i
believe
attempt
to
create
and
exploit
adversarial
condition
between
management
and
employee
the
way
i
see
it
most
of
today
s
union
be
simply
political
organization
their
shop
floor
leader
be
often
rough
and
tumble
character
and
the
one
that
shout
the
loud
that
say
the
owner
and
manager
be
just
a
bunch
of
no
good
son
of
bitch
be
the
one
that
usually
get
elect
in
their
quest
to
get
elect
they
make
a
lot
of
sweep
promise
regard
bread
and
butter
issue
such
as
high
wage
and
guaranteed
job
security
but
the
truth
be
that
no
union
no
company
and
no
government
can
guarantee
job
in
the
final
analysis
the
best
guarantee
for
job
security
be
to
have
a
fair
work
relationship
between
management
and
labour
one
that
allows
a
company
to
produce
quality
product
at
a
competitive
price
in
the
early
s
one
of
our
factory
in
the
east
end
of
toronto
be
unionized
we
have
bad
management
and
there
be
a
lot
of
favouritism
and
unfairness
inside
the
factory
employee
get
frustrate
when
they
saw
that
nothing
be
be
do
they
decide
to
join
a
union
and
then
shortly
after
go
on
strike
we
told
them
if
you
guy
want
to
come
back
to
work
then
you
ve
get
to
make
up
your
mind
you
re
either
with
magna
or
with
the
union
we
eliminate
a
lot
of
the
problem
and
clean
up
the
mess
that
management
left
when
worker
decide
to
return
we
make
sure
that
no
one
be
penalize
because
i
fully
sympathize
with
what
they
do
even
if
i
may
disagree
with
the
attitude
and
tactic
of
some
union
i
do
believe
that
union
have
an
important
role
to
ful
fill
in
society
from
ensure
that
employee
get
a
fair
share
of
the
economic
pie
they
help
produce
to
provide
assistance
to
employee
who
be
treat
unfairly
and
need
legal
representation
but
union
shouldn
t
have
a
role
when
it
come
to
run
the
business
affair
of
a
company
if
a
business
be
flounder
management
must
be
give
some
leeway
to
take
the
action
necessary
to
turn
the
business
around
in
other
word
management
must
have
the
right
to
manage
if
a
business
can
t
call
the
shot
on
key
operational
issue
the
owner
may
as
well
turn
the
shop
key
over
to
the
union
and
let
it
run
the
company
from
time
to
time
i
m
unfairly
accuse
of
want
to
dismantle
labour
organization
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
truth
on
the
contrary
i
want
to
participate
in
improve
labour
organization
and
labour
relation
i
ve
always
recognize
the
need
for
employee
representation
in
fact
over
the
last
fifty
year
at
magna
we
have
work
hard
to
create
job
security
and
improve
the
wage
and
work
condition
of
employee
we
ve
put
in
place
program
and
principle
to
protect
the
right
of
worker
everything
from
share
profit
with
employee
to
create
an
employee
s
charter
of
right
that
provide
employee
with
competitive
wage
and
benefit
a
safe
and
healthful
workplace
and
fair
treatment
at
magna
we
believe
these
principle
will
in
the
long
run
serve
our
employee
much
well
than
the
adversarial
philosophy
and
principle
of
present
day
union
in
addition
we
be
constantly
strive
to
create
new
program
to
provide
enhance
job
security
and
increase
benefit
for
our
employee
around
the
world
i
could
even
see
that
one
day
union
as
we
know
them
will
no
longer
exist
they
would
be
replace
by
a
national
labour
council
whose
mission
would
be
to
be
ensure
fairness
in
the
workplace
both
in
the
way
employee
be
treat
and
in
guarantee
that
they
get
a
fair
share
of
the
economic
pie
instead
of
shop
steward
i
envision
something
more
along
the
line
of
an
ombudsman
much
like
the
employee
advocate
we
have
at
magna
employee
elect
by
their
fellow
worker
who
cannot
be
dismiss
by
management
and
can
only
be
replace
by
employee
via
a
secret
ballot
vote
and
speak
of
voting
i
think
we
ll
also
see
great
employee
democracy
with
employee
even
have
the
authority
to
dismiss
fellow
worker
who
be
abusive
or
lazy
employee
be
smart
they
know
what
s
right
and
what
s
fair
and
collectively
through
a
secret
vote
they
could
weed
out
worker
who
be
disrupt
the
workplace
the
bad
apple
who
not
only
impact
productivity
but
who
also
affect
all
those
around
them
i
ve
never
say
that
it
be
only
labour
that
must
change
the
truth
be
that
business
must
change
labour
must
change
and
government
must
change
we
all
have
to
work
together
business
labour
and
government
to
remain
competitive
and
we
have
to
take
a
long
hard
look
at
how
we
operate
what
we
all
know
be
that
the
old
way
the
way
of
entrench
adversarial
and
confrontational
condition
between
business
and
labour
be
clearly
not
the
path
to
prosperity
and
global
competitiveness
that
s
why
i
join
force
with
buzz
hargrove
the
tough
as
nail
former
head
of
the
canadian
auto
worker
caw
union
to
create
a
new
labour
relation
model
over
the
year
i
ve
always
gotten
along
well
with
buzz
we
ve
square
off
more
than
once
over
everything
from
union
drive
and
negotiation
to
strike
we
may
not
have
always
agree
but
we
always
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
one
another
both
of
us
start
out
on
the
factory
floor
i
respect
the
fact
that
buzz
be
a
straight
shooter
and
he
probably
respect
my
school
of
hard
knock
upbringing
one
day
we
have
lunch
and
i
discuss
with
him
the
possibility
of
draft
a
new
framework
for
labour
management
relation
i
say
buzz
we
gotta
change
thing
if
we
keep
go
down
the
road
we
re
on
if
we
continue
with
this
confrontational
environment
there
won
t
be
any
job
left
it
shouldn
t
be
that
difficult
for
you
to
put
on
one
page
of
paper
what
s
important
for
worker
and
for
me
to
put
on
another
page
what
business
require
in
order
to
be
competitive
we
agree
that
we
would
try
to
map
something
out
when
lunch
be
over
and
we
shook
hand
buzz
told
me
he
didn
t
think
the
idea
would
fly
that
he
d
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
sell
the
concept
to
his
member
i
say
buzz
i
sympathize
with
you
magna
s
executive
management
and
factory
manager
aren
t
go
to
be
too
crazy
about
it
either
in
just
before
buzz
retire
we
held
a
press
conference
at
the
magna
head
office
to
announce
a
major
breakthrough
a
new
labour
relation
agreement
call
the
framework
of
fairness
base
on
social
economic
justice
its
purpose
to
create
a
prototype
for
the
future
of
management
labour
relation
one
that
seek
to
avoid
and
defuse
the
adversarial
and
confrontational
condition
that
have
often
exist
in
the
past
and
that
threaten
to
hinder
the
global
competitiveness
of
many
business
in
north
america
and
europe
its
ultimate
mandate
be
to
preserve
job
create
new
job
and
improve
the
living
standard
of
employee
under
the
framework
of
fairness
management
and
the
union
become
partner
in
ensure
productivity
and
fairness
in
the
workplace
for
example
the
framework
include
provision
for
great
operational
flexibility
and
a
clear
cut
profit
participation
plan
involve
employee
and
management
it
do
away
with
union
steward
and
even
eliminates
the
two
traditional
weapon
of
labour
and
management
strike
and
lockout
in
favour
of
final
offer
arbitration
the
framework
be
also
base
on
the
realization
that
the
best
guarantee
for
job
security
be
management
and
employee
work
together
to
produce
quality
product
at
a
competitive
price
at
the
same
time
in
strive
for
great
efficiency
the
agreement
ensures
there
be
no
compromise
or
short
cut
when
it
come
to
workplace
issue
such
as
fairness
dignity
and
safety
the
framework
of
fairness
model
be
base
on
the
belief
that
society
need
check
and
balance
the
basic
mandate
of
a
business
be
to
make
a
profit
a
business
that
do
not
generate
a
profit
be
no
good
to
anyone
not
to
its
shareholder
and
owner
not
to
its
employee
and
not
to
society
at
large
without
profit
a
business
cannot
provide
employment
create
spinoff
work
for
supplier
and
contractor
invest
in
equipment
and
building
pay
tax
or
even
donate
to
social
and
charitable
cause
all
activity
that
benefit
the
economy
and
society
but
the
make
of
profit
must
be
temper
for
the
benefit
of
all
stakeholder
include
society
and
i
believe
this
be
one
area
where
labour
advisory
council
could
have
an
important
role
to
play
when
all
be
say
and
do
all
of
the
major
stakeholder
of
a
business
be
in
the
same
boat
together
management
must
constantly
think
about
what
it
have
to
do
to
build
a
well
product
for
a
well
price
and
garner
a
good
return
on
the
money
it
have
invest
management
must
also
prove
to
employee
day
in
and
day
out
that
it
care
and
that
it
be
willing
to
create
a
safe
and
fair
work
environment
the
framework
of
fairness
be
the
start
of
an
evolutionary

realistic
enough
to
know
that
the
framework
will
inevitably
require
some
fine
tune
as
we
proceed
under
this
new
arrangement
but
at
the
same
time
i
believe
we
found
some
common
ground
on
a
model
agreement
that
will
allow
our
industry
to
become
more
efficient
and
more

one
thing
be
clear
the
old
labour
management

no

eliminate

monopoly
whether

they

they
lead
to

low

the

tool

chapter
at
the
forefront
of
the
electric
car
revolution
any
society
that
stifle
individual
in
the
pursuit
of
productivity
and
excellence
be
a
decay
society
you
don
t
have
to
be
a
great
scientist
to
figure
out
that
the
world
s
gasoline
supply
be
be
drain
at
a
rapid
rate
when
you
stop
to
think
about
the
amount
of
gasoline
that
be
consume
around
the
globe
every
day
from
los
angeles
to
shanghai
from
london
to
rio
de
janeiro
it
s
the
equivalent
of
a
huge
river
flow
into
the
ocean
and
it
s
not
difficult
to
see
that
this
river
will
one
day
dry
up
fossil
fuel
power
our
vehicle
and
be
still
heavily
use
to
feed
the
engine
of
our
industry
to
produce
plastic
and
packaging
and
to
heat
our
home
but
the
current
rate
of
consumption
be
simply
not
sustainable
that
s
why
it
s
crucial
that
we
as
a
society
put
more
money
into
research
to
come
up
with
alternative
fuel
and
alternative
energy
strategy
i
believe
the
automotive
industry
can
lead
the
way
in
the
alternative
energy
revolution
that
will
reshape
the
way
we
live
in
the
decade
ahead
there
will
be
a
large
and
grow
market
for
electric
and
alternative
energy
vehicle
this
demand
will
be
driven
in
part
by
the
rise
price
of
oil
and
in
part
by
the
grow
desire
of
consumer
to
protect
the
environment
by
reduce
greenhouse
gas
it
will
require
a
massive
amount
of
upfront
research
and
development
and
the
payback
may
be
slow
in
the
early
go
and
to
get
this
fledgling
industry
really
move
government
will
also
have
to
get
into
the
game
and
come
to
the
table
with
some
tax
incentive
to
spark
business
investment
magna
have
always
be
on
the
lead
edge
of
innovation
and
new
technology
so
it
s
not
surprising
that
the
company
be
at
the
forefront
of
electric
vehicle
technology
magna
be
by
no
mean
a
bystander
in
the
development
of
the
electric
car
i
could
see
the
trend
toward
electric
vehicle
several
decade
ago
in
we
enter
into
a
joint
venture
with
a
german
firm
to
develop
sodium
sulphur
electric
battery
two
year
later
one
of
our
division
achieve
major
breakthrough
in
the
manufacturing
process
use
to
make
component
require
in
the
sodium
sulphur
battery
and
by
magna
be
assemble
the
first
electric
power
van
ever
certify
under
north
american
highway
safety
legislation
but
our
customer
have
no
real
appetite
to
produce
electric
vehicle
for
the
mass
market
gas
be
cheap
and
carmaker
be
focus
on
building
big
car
with
even
big
combustion
engine
around
that
time
magna
face
a
financial
crunch
and
the
electric
car
battery
division
be
one
of
the
first
that
we
close
in
a
bid
to
conserve
cash
at
magna
we
ve
pumped
million
of
dollar
over
the
year
into
various
electric
vehicle
technology
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
re
run
a
business
you
can
t
have
a
mother
teresa
approach
we
have
to
make
a
profit
i
ve
always
view
electric
vehicle
technology
as
a
win
win
it
s
both
a
potentially
lucrative
business
opportunity
and
an
opportunity
to
do
something
good
for
society
that
win
win
moment
come
in
january
at
the
detroit
auto
show
when
magna
and
ford
motor
company
jointly
announce
a
groundbreaking
partnership
agreement
to
bring
an
electric
car
to
the
market
in
we
unveiled
an
early
prototype
of
the
vehicle
at
the
show
a
team
of
magna
engineer
developed
it
in
just
under
six
month
an
astonish
feat
i
have
put
the
challenge
to
build
an
all
electric
car
to
one
of
our
senior
product
development
people
ted
robertson
ted
be
born
and
raise
in
toronto
but
have
work
for
most
of
his
career
at
general
motor
in
detroit
where
he
retire
as
chief
engineer
emeritus
he
have
only
be
retire
for
a
few
week
when
we
call
him
early
one
morning
on
the
golf
course
he
hadn
t
even
hit
his
first
ball
when
his
cell
phone
rang
and
we
ask
him
if
he
would
be
interested
in
join
magna
where
he
could
sink
his
teeth
into
some
juicy
product
development
project
real
blue
sky
stuff
ted
couldn
t
pas
up
the
challenge
under
my
direction
ted
work
around
the
clock
together
with
a
small
team
of
crack
engineer
at
magna
to
develop
what
become
one
of
the
world
s
first
all
electric
vehicle
they
built
the
car
out
of
thin
air
in
day
on
a
shoestring
budget
a
testament
to
the
drive
determination
and
ingenuity
of
magna
s
employee
i
drove
the
prototype
electric
car
around
the
magna
head
office
campus
reach
speed
of
over
kilometre
per
hour
and
when
i
get
out
of
the
car
i
told
the
guy
we
be
go
to
take
it
down
to
detroit
and
let
the
executive
at
ford
take
it
for
a
spin
the
rest
be
history
during
the
development
process
the
team
design
from
scratch
thirteen
entirely
new
electrical
system
that
don
t
exist
on
current
gas
power
vehicle
we
be
literally
reinvent
and
reconfiguring
the
architecture
of
the
car
around
the
same
time
magna
also
unveiled
a
new
electric
concept
vehicle
know
as
the
mila
ev
the
futuristic
car
can
be
adapt
to
run
on
natural
gas
fuel
cell
or
hybrid
drive
and
us
solar
cell
integrate
into
the
glass
roof
to
generate
additional
power
last
year
magna
e
car
system
open
a
new
electric
battery
assembly
facility
with
plan
to
build
an
even
large
one
in
the
near
future
if
i
hadn
t
push
the
electric
car
project
with
an
iron
will
it
would
have
never
happen
i
passionately
believe
in
it
believe
that
it
be
vital
to
the
future
of
magna
when
the
electric
vehicle
revolution
eventually
take
off
i
don
t
want
magna
to
get
left
behind
like
some
whip
and
buggy
maker
around
the
time
when
the
first
automobile
start
roll
off
the
assembly
line
today
magna
e
car
be
aggressively
pursue
a
strategy
to
produce
the
world
s
most
efficient
energy
cell
the
beating
heart
of
the
electric
car
if
it
s
able
to
achieve
this
strategy
magna
will
be
uniquely
position
in
the
automotive
industry
as
the
only
company
that
can
build
and
supply
everything
from
battery
cell
and
battery
pack
to
electric
component
and
complete
electric
vehicle
engineering
and
assembly
and
magna
e
car
be
also
work
on
the
development
of
an
electric
vehicle
platform
a
chassis
on
wheel
complete
with
all
of
the
component
and
system
need
in
an
electric
vehicle
automotive
customer
can
add
the
exterior
body
and
skin
on
top
of
the
chassis
as
well
as
all
of
the
interior
component
and
system
that
go
inside
and
then
sell
the
vehicle
under
their
own
brand
name
if
it
s
successful
and
if
the
electric
car
industry
grows
the
way
it
be
project
to
i
believe
magna
e
car
may
one
day
eclipse
magna
in
both
size
and
sale
investment
in
electric
vehicle
and
battery
technology
will
eventually
produce
thousand
of
new
job
and
provide
enormous
long
term
benefit
to
our
economy
i
m
confident
that
magna
will
play
a
major
role
in
shape
and
building
the
car
of
the
future
imagination
will
be
as
critical
as
the
electric
technology
power
these
new
vehicle
and
because
the
heart
of
the
vehicle
be
the
electric
battery
rather
than
the
combustion
engine
it
open
up
the
possibility
of
radically
redesign
the
car
of
the
future
it
s
an
excite
place
to
be
engage
in
the
process
of
rethink
the
vehicle
abandon
the
old
feature
of
a
bygone
era
and
envision
what
new
feature
will
be
desire
by
the
driver
of
the
century
ahead
imagination
not
only
enables
us
to
visualize
what
kind
of
new
car
we
might
create
but
also
open
the
door
to
invent
a
completely
new
form
of
individual
transportation
what
if
instead
of
a
car
the
modern
version
of
the
horse
drawn
coach
we
create
individual
fly
machine
instead
i
believe
we
can
and
i
believe
we
ll
see
such
device
at
some
point
this
century
one
thing
you
can
take
to
the
bank
they

magna
make

of

on
the

degree

every
kind

it
can
spell
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
between
overcome
what
look
like
an
insurmountable
problem
and
be
overwhelmed
by
despair
and
defeat
with
the

of

any

can
be
solve
chapter

twenty

offering
us

there
but
we
want
to
build
in
aurora
close
to
where
a

of
our
factory
be
locate
we
didn
t
ask
for
any
tax

and
special

we
didn
t
even
ask
that
the

approval
process
be
speed
up
incredibly
that
process
drag
on
and
on
take
close
to
three
year
from
start
to
finish
in
the
s
we
open
a
plant
in
the
town
of
nashville
in
southern
illinois
i
ll
never
forget
the
day
of
our
official
opening
it
seem
like
the
whole
town
come
out
to
celebrate
large
banner
proclaim

magna
and
march
band
greet
us
the

there
the

come
it
be
like
a
national
holiday
we
never
receive
a
reception
like
that
in
canada
in
some
community
we
have
open
dozen
of
factory
and
donate
million
of
dollar
to
local
cause
and
charity
and
we
never
even
get
so
much
as
a
letter
of

i
wasn

bitter

i
chalked
it
up
to
the
difference
in
the
two
culture
still
i
be
grow
frustrate
with
the
bureaucratic
delay
here
at
home
at
one
point
i
told
a
reporter
that
when
a
new
business
come
to
town
in
the
u
s
they
roll
out
the
red
carpet
in
canada
they
roll
out
the
red
tape
in
today
s
relentless
global
competition
it
s
not
just
business
that
need
to
become
more
efficient
so
do
government
throughout
the
western
world
we
have
far
too
much
government
bureaucracy
and
overhead
and
we
re
pay
for
that
overhead
through
very
high
rate
of
taxation
that
make
us
increasingly
uncompetitive
on
a
global
scale
at
a
time
when
economy
be
engage
in
global
economic
warfare
i
ve
often
say
that
if
you
run

it

t
matter
how

the

on
the

the

for

the
truth
be
whether
it

north
america

europe
we
re
overtaxed
over
regulate
and
over
govern
country
throughout
the
west
need
to
take
a
long
hard
look
at
all
of
the
hidden
cost
of

business
that
be
choke
productivity
and
they
also
need
to
think
about
what
they
can
do
to
reduce
the
inevitable
build
up
of
bureaucracy
the
harder
bureaucrat
work
the
more
bureaucrat
they
create
it
s
almost
like
a
law
of
nature
the
more
we
keep
feed
the
gorilla
of
government
bureaucracy
the
big
the
gorilla
get
but
at
the
same
time
i
don
t
think
government
bureaucrat
should
be
make
the
scapegoat
for
our
problem
it
s
not
the
fault
of
civil
servant
that
bureaucracy
have
gotten
bloat
all
of
us
to
a
certain
extent
be
to
blame
because
we
as
a
society
have
repeatedly
turn
to
government
as
the
chief
source
to
solve
all
of
our
social
and
economic
problem
and
fulfill
all
of
our
need
let
s
face
it
there
s
a
lot
of
government
fat
that
can
be
cut
out
and
a
lot
of
waste
that
can
be
stop
by
turn
off
the
tap
of
taxpayer
funding
i
see
no
reason
why
we
couldn
t
immediately
institute
a
program
of
target
cut
in
government
spending
the
reduction
could
be
do
without
take
a
chainsaw
to
government
program
without
jeopardizing
safety
the
environment
education
or
health
by
simply
reduce
government
spending
by
to
percent
per
year
over
a
period
of
five
year
government
employee
affected
by
streamline
government
service
would
receive
a
fair
settlement
the
result
would
be
dramatic
after
five
year
tax
could
be
as
much
as
percent
low
than
what
they
be
now
and
investment
money
would
start
flow
in
one
area
of
government
that
have
grown
grossly
inefficient
be
the
welfare
system
the
social
safety
net
that
western
democracy
create
follow
the
economic
turbulence
of
the
great
depression
and
world
war
ii
be
design
to
protect
citizen
from
economic
hardship
and
cushion
individual
who
fell
through
the
crack
over
time
that
safety
net
have
grown
wider
and
have
become
pad
with
more
and
big
benefit
decade
of
government
coddle
have
create
a
grow
class
of
people
who
be
not
able
to
be
productive
citizen
we
ve
go
astray
from
the
core
principle
that
government
should
only
set
the
ground
rule
and
provide
a
minimum
number
of
service
and
embrace
a
philosophy
that
government
should
do
everything
regardless
of
whether
or
not
individual
can
look
after
themselves
and
along
the
way
we
ve
forgotten
that
government
can
t
give
you
anything
unless
they
take
it
from
you
in
the
first
place
waste
a
good
portion
of
the
money
in
the
process
the
key
question
with
regard
to
social
assistance
be
this
can
we
reduce
poverty
while
preserve
the
dignity
of
people
on
welfare
and
also
cut
government
expenditure
at
the
same
time
i
think
we
can
i
would
propose
that
everyone
require
social
assistance
receive
a
government
issue
credit
card
with
a
monthly
maximum
dollar
amount
along
with
minimum
allocation
for
food
accommodation
and
clothing
the
card
would
guarantee
that
recipient
could
buy
all
of
their
basic
food
need
with
minimum
dollar
amount
base
on
food
requirement
for
individual
or
family
the
card
could
not
be
use
to
purchase
non
essential
item
such
as
alcohol
or
lottery
ticket
in
essence
the
card
would
ensure
that
people
receive
nutritious
food
affordable
shelter
clothing
and
other
necessity
of
life
at
the
same
time
we
should
also
take
a
closer
look
at
whether
or
not
the
state
need
to
become
more
involve
in
intervention
on
behalf
of
child
who
be
living
in
home
where
there
be
physical
emotional
and
mental
abuse
neglect
malnourishment
and
improper
care
in
an
ideal
society
all
child
would
be
raise
by
love
and
care
parent
but
the
reality
be
that
many
be
be
raise
in
dysfunctional
environment
with
a
parent
or
parent
who
be
barely
capable
of
look
after
themselves
due
to
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
or
mental
illness
child
who
grow
up
in
this
kind
of
environment
be
often
doom
to
live
the
same
sort
of
self
destructive
life
as
their
parent
dependent
on
government
handout
for
their
entire
life
we
should
consider
whether
these
abuse
and
abandon
child
ought
to
be
raise
in
government
support
child
care
home
where
they
would
have
access
to
proper
learn
nutrition
and
physical
education
poverty
be
a
cancer
within
society
and
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
eradicate
it
like
cancer
poverty
grows
and
spread
if
left
unchecked
we
ve
try
the
current
system
of
welfare
for
three
generation
now
and
it
clearly
be
not
help
a
large
number
of
the
people
that
it
be
meant
to
help
on
the
contrary
we
ve
create
a
system
that
breed
poverty
from
one
generation
to
the
next
sometimes
you
have
to
get
very
sick
before
you
can
begin
to
get
healthy
again
perhaps
our
society
be
reach
that
point
now
perhaps
we
ll
soon
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
ve
do
ourselves
no
favour
by
be
too
soft
and
too
lax
by
herd
and
spoon
feed
a
large
and
large
portion
of
society
introduce
a
social
assistance
credit
card
will
help
make
welfare
what
it
be
originally
intend
to
be
a
hand
up
for
those
who
have
fall
on
hard
time
and
need
temporary
relief
and
financial
security
for
those
who
as
a
result
of
accident
or
illness
be
unable
to
support
themselves
ultimately
we
need
to
create
government
system
that
harness
the
deep
seat
human
instinct
to
do
well
rather
than
support
dead
end
trap
that
keep
many
people
living
well
below
their
potential
i
ve
always
maintain
when
it
come
to
business
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
bad
worker
only
bad
manager
the
same
principle
hold
true
for
government
and
their
citizen
when
country
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
debt
it
s
usually
the
fault
of
poorly
manage
government
and
reckless
politician
look
for
quick
fix
and
easy
solution
in
other
word
politician
often
end
up
place
short
term
political
gain
ahead
of
the
long
term
economic
well
be
of
the
nation
that
s
be
the
case
for
most
country
in
europe
and
north
america
where
for
decade
now
government
have
be
spending
more
than
they
ve
be
take
in
rack
up
massive
national
debt
in
the
process
every
household
know
that
it
can
t
spend
more
than
it
earns
otherwise
the
family
will
end
up
in
the
poor
house
every
farmer
know
that
he
can
t
spend
more
than
he
earns
otherwise
he
ll
eventually
lose
his
farm
and
every
business
person
know
that
if
your
business
spends
more
money
than
it
brings
in
the
company
will
eventually
go
bankrupt
most
politician
know
that
spending
be
out
of
control
but
they
re
afraid
to
do
anything
that
might
loosen
their
grip
on
power
basically
they
re
avoid
the
day
of
reckon
that
will
surely
come
i
believe
citizen
from
debt
burden
country
in
europe
and
north
america
need
to
push
for
change
that
will
tie
the
hand
of
free
spending
politician
so
that
government
cannot
spend
more
than
they
bring
in
through
tax
and
other
fee
at
the
same
time
government
need
to
begin
create
realistic
debt
repayment
program
that
have
real
teeth
and
specific
target
simply
balance
the
budget
be
not
enough
government
need
to
also
build
in
budget
surplus
so
they
can
begin
to
aggressively
pay
down
debt
through
annual
payment
amount
to
approximately
to
percent
of
the
total
debt
owe
there
be
no
escape
the
consequence
of
debt
one
way
or
another
we
will
all
have
to
pay
for
it
in
the
final
analysis
we
re
destroy
our
child
s
and
grandchild
s
future
it
s
high
time
that
we
face
up
to
our
debt
obligation
and
force
our
political
leader
to
stop
spending
more
than
they
take
in
but
when
it
come
to
the
health
of
our
economy
the
measure
that
have
the
single
great
bearing
be
the
tax
system
more
than
any
other
economic
lever
the
tax
system
determines
whether
the
economy
grows
shrink
or
stagnates
over
the
year
when
i
spoke
at
chamber
of
commerce
dinner
or
business
school
lecture
i
often
use
to
say
that
we
need
to
create
a
tax
system
that
a
high
school
student
could
understand
something
simple
straightforward
and
clear
cut
with
no
loophole
it
be
a
commonsense
statement
that
always
spark
loud
applause
from
the
audience
i
still
strongly
believe
that
we
need
a
tax
system
that
be
transparent
simpler
and
more
gear
toward
the
creation
of
wealth
if
we
developed
such
a
system
we
could
dramatically
reduce
government
overhead
and
free
business
from
the
time
spent
comply
with
tax
filing
and
prepare
for
tax
audit
time
that
ultimately
increase
the
final
cost
of
the
product
or
service
provide
by
the
business
the
tax
code
have
become
more
and
more
complicate
and
cumbersome
with
each
passing
year
require
a
grow
army
of
lawyer
and
tax
specialist
and
financial
expert
to
navigate
their
way
through
a
maze
of
rule
and
regulation
i
can
t
count
the
number
of
time
during
the
course
of
my
career
when
we
be
face
with
a
business
tax
matter
that
need
a
clear
cut
answer
the
tax
people
inside
the
company
sometimes
weren
t
quite
sure
which
road
to
take
so
we
would
consult
an
expert
from
one
of
the
big
downtown
tax
law
firm
who
would
say
well
frank
we
re
not
quite
sure
maybe
we
should
talk
to
another
expert
and
that
expert
would
say
the
same
thing
after
countless
meeting
and
thousand
of
dollar
in
fee
no
one
could
put
forward
a
definitive
answer
but
it
wasn
t
the
fault
of
the
expert
who
be
merely
try
to
find
their
way
through
the
convolute
tax
code
the
tax
system
itself
be
to
blame
the
plain
fact
be
the
tax
system
be
overly
complicate
too
vague
and
too
difficult
to
understand
it
have
become
a
drag
on
economic
growth
and
a
drain
on
national
expenditure
require
a
huge
bureaucracy
to
administer
and
oversee
the
tangle
of
tax
legislation
why
couldn
t
country
in
the
western
world
create
a
tax
system
that
be
simple
straightforward
and
clear
cut
the
system
i
would
propose
be
a
flat
tax
combine
with
a
consumption
tax
that
would
be
apply
to
the
purchase
of
all
product
and
service
the
flat
tax
rate
would
be
around
percent
to
start
out
but
if
we
streamline
government
spending
it
could
come
down
to
as
low
as
percent
and
it
would
apply
to
all
personal
income
above
for
example
as
well
as
all
corporate
and
capital
income
dividend
and
interest
income
corporation
that
invest
their
profit
in
foreign
country
would
pay
the
full
flat
tax
rate
however
business
that
invest
their
profit
in
the
country
where
they
re
base
would
not
pay
any
tax
on
the
amount
invest
a
reward
for
create
job
or
invest
in
technology
at
home
in
addition
a
revamped
tax
system
should
recognize
that
a
successful
business
require
three
force
to
create
wealth
good
management
hard
work
employee
and
investor
all
three
of
these
stakeholder
have
a
moral
right
to
share
in
the
financial
outcome
magna
have
show
for
the
past
half
century
that
share
profit
with
employee
be
a
proven
and
powerful
formula
for
growth
when
worker
have
a
tangible
stake
in
the
company
s
financial
success
they
be
more
motivate
to
produce
a
well
product
for
a
well
price
as
a
result
i
believe
that
business
that
share
a
minimum
percent
of
their
profit
with
their
employee
should
pay
a
low
flat
tax
rate
revamp
the
tax
system
along
these
line
together
with
reduce
government
spending
would
unleash
an
economic
boom
such
as
we
haven
t
experienced
since
the
end
of
the
second
world
war
it
would
put
million
of
people
back
to
work
most
importantly
it
would
create
the
condition
necessary
for
enhance
productivity
and
wealth
creation
whether
it
s
business
or
government
the
key
watchword
in
today
s
world
be
efficiency
efficiency
efficiency
those
business
and
government
that
understand
this
will
prosper
those
that
do
not
be
doom
to
fall
behind
we
ve
travel
too
far
down
the
road
of
state
enterprise
and
government
control
we
ve
allow
ourselves
to
get
slowly
suck
into
a
system
that
stifle
individual
initiative
and
smother
the
key
productive
force
of
society
and
any
society
that
stifle
individual
in
the
pursuit

me

the
reality

that

s
why

of
when
my

me
by

hand
to
meet
the
foreman
of
the
big
factory
in
my
hometown
the
elin
factory
in
weiz
with
its
large
smokestack
and

row
of
rectangular

where
she
and
hundred
of
other
local
work
make
electrical
motor
and
various
industrial
product
i
recall
stand
with
my
mother
and
the
other
worker
in
the
chill
morning
air
wait
for
the
large
gate
to
open
to
signal
the
start
of
the
morning
shift
my
mother
an
iron
will
and
pragmatic
lady
ask
the
foreman
to
teach
her
teenage
son
a
trade
in
toolmaking
she
figure
it
be
a
practical
profession
that
i
could
one
day
count
on
to
put
a
roof
over
my
head
and
feed
my
family
there
be
a
few
hundred
application
and
they
only
take
thirty
apprentice
and
i
be
one
of
them
on
my
first
day
before
leave
home
my
mom
say
make
sure
you
work
hard
and
listen
be
attentive
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
bad
remark
about
you
i
be
so
young
that
i
have
to
stand
on
a
wooden
crate
in
order
to
reach
the
vice
grip
on
the
workbench
like
all
young
apprentice
at
the
elin
factory
i
be
give
a
block
of
steel
and
my
first
task
be
to
cut
off
a
chunk
it
take
two
people
to
lift
up
the
slab
of
steel
and
clamp
it
inside
the
jaw
of
the
vice
grip
to
accomplish
this
task
we
be
give
a
hacksaw
it
be
like
something
straight
out
of
a
prison
escape
movie
where
you
see
a
guy
saw
away
at
the
steel
bar
at
least
that
s
how
i
felt
that
it
be
go
to
take
year
and
year
to
hack
through
half
a
foot
of
cold
hard
steel
if
you
saw
steadily
you
could
slice
through
a
half
inch
of
steel
per
day
as
it
turn
out
it
take
about
a
week
and
a
half
to
cut
a
piece
off
i
be
among
the
first
to
finish
the
task
i
always
try
to
be
the
best
and
to
finish
first
the
palm
of
my
hand
be
cover
with
torn
and
bloody
blister
our
next
task
be
to
file
the
chunk
of
steel
into
a
rough
square
it
be
a
gruelling
and
exact
chore
that
would
consume
the
well
part
of
three
week
day
in
and
day
out
filing
and
measure
then
grind
and
filing
again
some
of
the
kid
there
didn
t
take
the
task
seriously
and
get
show
the
door
there
be
always
another
kid
wait
outside
the
gate
of
the
elin
factory
who
be
more
than
willing
to
take
his
place
a
supervisor
be
assign
to
watch
over
us
he
be
fairly
strict
at
any
give
time
he
have
around
thirty
young
boy
under
his
wing
and
we
be
all
over
the
map
bumping
into
each
other
drop
tool
talk
excitedly
but
under
the
supervisor
s
watchful
eye
there
be
never
any
loaf
around
or
excessive
yak
once
we
have
our
chunk
of
steel
approximately
six
inch
long
by
six
inch
wide
and
six
inch
deep
we
have
to
turn
it
into
a
perfectly
square
block
i
file
and
file
and
file
it
take
three
long
agonize
month
to
get
the
edge
absolutely
even
you
don
t
put
a
wet
behind
the
ear
year
old
kid
on
a
machine
on
the
floor
so
it
make
sense
that
they
would
give
me
an
assignment
like
that
once
the
task
be
complete
the
instructor
would
check
it
with
a
square
he
tucked
the
square
up
against
the
corner
of
the
block
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
stream
through
the
big
window
in
the
factory
in
order
to
pas
there
could
be
no
daylight
between
the
square
and
the
block
it
have
to
be
spot
on
i
m
not
very
nostalgic
but
i
d
like
to
have
that
block
of
steel
today
as
a
keepsake
it
would
make
a
fine
paperweight
after
that
first
assignment
the
task
become
increasingly
more
complicate
we
have
to
make
a
hammer
with
a
wooden
handle
then
a
marker
a
point
round
chisel
for
measure
where
you
need
to
drill
hole
then
scissors
basically
we
be
make
tool
that
we
could
use
during
the
remainder
of
our
apprenticeship
and
we
also
learn
how
to
shape
metal
i
start
each
day
of
my
apprenticeship
at
exactly
a
m
it
be
about
a
twenty
minute
walk
to
the
factory
from
my
home
which
sat
on
the
edge
of
town
after
my
second
year
as
an
apprentice
i
have
save
up
enough
money
to
buy
a
bike
and
rode
it
to
the
factory
every
morning
we
have
lunch
at
our
workbench
most
day
and
we
talk
about
the
usual
thing
boy
our
age
discuss
girl
sport
music
and
movie
especially
movie
about
america
with
its
skyscraper
and
futuristic
technology
and
the
infectious
energy
and
optimism
of
its
people
during
those
first
few
month
of
the
apprenticeship
we
get
a
feel
for
the
material
we
be
use
a
feel
for
the
tool
their
heft
in
the
palm
of
our
hand
and
how
when
we
tighten
our
finger
around
the
handle
they
become
almost
like
wood
and
steel
extension
of
our
arm
we
be
become
toolmaker
sculptor
of
steel
the
austrian
enjoy
a
well
deserve
reputation
throughout
europe
as
good
toolmaker
due
in
large
part
to
the
fact
that
the
country
be
bless
with
great
deposit
of
iron
ore
go
back
to
the
middle
age
austria
always
have
a
lot
of
blacksmith
shop
and
iron
smelter
that
would
melt
down
the
iron
ore
and
turn
it
into
metal
product
over
the
century
the
country
developed
a
culture
and
a
tradition
of
toolmaking
furthermore
the
country
developed
an
education
system
that
emphasize
technical
skill
training
and
apprenticeship
program
so
that
young
people
could
learn
a
trade
when
you
add
all
that
together
it
s
not
surprising
that
austria
have
produce
a
lot
of
excellent
toolmaker
and
technician
over
the
year
as
an
apprentice
i
be
rotate
in
and
out
of
various
department
in
the
second
year
of
my
apprenticeship
i
remember
work
in
the
blacksmith
department
i
be
hammer
a
piece
of
hot
steel
repeatedly
pound
away
to
get
it
just
right
when
it
drop
from
the
jaw
of
my
plier
i
didn
t
want
it
to
hit
the
cement
floor
and
warp
or
bend
so
i
instinctively
reach
down
and
grabbed
it
before
it
hit
the
floor
i
get
badly
burn
but
put
grease
on
my
hand
wrap
it
with
a
few
cloth
and
kept
work
the
old
worker
take
me
under
their
wing
and
i
quickly
developed
a
like
for
life
at
the
factory
the
rhythm
and
routine
of
the
workday
the
camaraderie
of
my
co
worker
and
the
sense
of
achievement
that
come
with
building
quality
tool
i
join
the
factory
soccer
team
in
my
second
year
at
elin
i
played
the
centre
halfback
position
and
we
travel
around
the
province
and
compete
against
team
from
nearby
town
it
be
a
great
way
to
bond
with
some
of
the
guy
i
work
with
one
time
i
accidentally
push
the
drill
through
my
index
finger
i
lift
up
my
hand
and
look
right
through
the
hole
in
my
flesh
and
bone
then
take
a
deep
breath
and
blew
through
my
pierce
finger
i
knew
that
if
i
report
the
accident
to
the
company
nurse
i
wouldn
t
be
able
to
play
in
that
even

big
soccer
game
so
i
stuck
my
finger
in
a
bottle
of
iodine
a
few
time
wrap
a
clean
rag
around
it
and
kept
on
work
i
show
up
for
the
pre
game
practice
on
schedule
my
bloody
and
bandage
hand
throb
in
pain
look
back
i
guess
you
could
say
it
be
a
sign
of
a
dog
determination
and
will
to
win
that
burn
inside

that
would
serve
me
well
later
in

fine
meticulous

end
of
a

and
within
that
circle
i
have
to
drill
a
hole
the
size
of
a
human
hair
it
be
the
kind
of
finesse
work
that
take
my
skill
to
a
whole
new
level
when
i
get
my
first
paycheque
i
walk
up
and
down
the
main
street
of
bern
look
for
a
swank
restaurant
i
order
a
veal
dish
and
it
come
on
a
silver
platter
i
start
cut
into
the

with
my
knife
when
the

over
and
gracefully
told
me
that
i
have
to
take
it
off
the
platter
and
put
it
on
my
plate
i
be
a
touch
embarrass
but
at
the
same
time
i
felt
that
the
former
barefoot
country
boy
be
start
to
learn
the
sophisticated
and
culture
way
of
the
city
i
start
pay
attention
to
the
detail
of
manner
how
to
sit
how
to
hold
your
knife
where
to
place
your
dinner
napkin
i
have
the
waitress
to
thank
for
that
when
the
bill
come
i
ask
her
out
on
a
date
and
she
accepted
i
be
in
switzerland
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
and
played
soccer
for
one
of
the
top
notch
local
team
it
be
a
carefree
life
i
be
year
old
work
hard
during
the
day
and
visit
the
caf
s
and
bar
during
the
evening
i
eventually
move
back
to
weiz
lure
home
by
the
offer
of
a
job
as
a
tool
room
foreman
and
i
work
there
for
about
a
year
a
foreman
s
job
be
a
big
step
up
the
pay
be
a
lot
high
but
my
old
hometown
seem
so
small
so
shelter
bern
by
comparison
be
cosmopolitan
an
international
city
with
embassy
and
classy
sophisticated
people
from
around
the
world
people
who
have
be
to
south
africa
australia
the
u
s
and
canada
those
be
the
place
where
i
want
to
go
so
those
be
the
country
where
i
apply
for
an
immigration
visa
canada
be
look
to
bring
in
skilled
tradespeople
include
toolmaker
and
the
canadian
visa
application
come
through
first
i
m
sometimes
pretty
hard
on
canadian
bureaucrat
but
i
still
think
they
re
the
best
in
the
world
because
they
be
the
first
to
come
through
with
a
visa
for
that
i
be
forever
grateful
nowadays
however
not
many
toolmaker
immigrate
to
canada
or
the
united
state
in
the
early
year
magna
be
able
to
recruit
great
technical
people
who
have
immigrate
from
europe
but
when
that
wave
of
immigration
dry
up
and
the
company
begin
opening
up
new
factory
in
country
around
the
world
we
realize
that
we
need
to
build
our
own
magna
training
centre
so
when
magna
be
mushroom
in
size
back
in
the
mid
s
we
establish
our
first
technical
training
centre
to
supply
the
skilled
tradespeople
we
would
require
in
the
year
ahead
unfortunately
we
have
to
close
the
state
of
the
art
facility
during
the
restructuring
process
in
the
early
s
when
magna
battle
back
from
a
debt
fuel
financial
crisis
later
that
decade
once
we
be
back
on
our
foot
we
open
the
magna
technical
training
centre
which
provide
apprenticeship
training
and
hand
on
learn
for
mould
maker
tool
and
die
maker
and
millwright
student
work
on
practical
assignment
and
gain
far
experience
while
apprentice
at
a
magna
division
they
get
a
feel
for
the
total
chain
of
activity
that
go
on
within
a
factory
and
they
acquire
valuable
hand
on
experience
manager
with
the
manufacturing
skill
and
know
how
need
to
run
magna
factory
don
t
just
fall
from
the
sky
they
have
to
learn
the
business
from
the
ground
up
the
same
way
i
do
and
the
same
way
many
of
our
president
and
ceo
do
over
the
year
they
be
all
guy
who
work
on
the
shop
floor
who
come
up
through
the
rank
our
technical
training
centre
locate
around
the
world
now
be
essentially
breeding
ground
for
future
manager
i
have
already
come
to
the
conclusion
several
decade
earlier
that
we
could
not
count
on
the
educational
system
of
canada
and
the
u
s
to
produce
the
skilled
tradespeople
we
need
we
be
on
our
own
it
s
a
shame
because
i
believe
that
our
centre
of
high
learn
should
focus
on
provide
our
young
people
with
the
skill
and
knowledge
they
will
need
to
develop
innovative
new
product
and
technology
the
skill
need
to
produce
the
sort
of
entrepreneur
and
manager
who
will
build
successful
business
but
i
also
believe
that
many
of
our
university
and
college
have
become
too
far
remove
from
the
reality
of
the
competitive
marketplace
and
global
economy
the
world
be
spin
much
too
fast
for
these
institution
by
the
time
a
textbook
be
publish
a
great
deal
of
its
knowledge
and
theory
be
already
outdated
to
make
matter
bad
you
ve
get
a
large
number
of
academic
do
research
that
have
absolutely
no
useful
application
and
there
be
a
shortage
of
teacher
who
have
real
world
practical
experience
i
believe
one
solution
be
to
establish
small
more
specialized
university
as
part
of
a
coordinate
public
private
undertaking
for
instance
we
could
create
specialized
university
that
target
learn
and
research
in
traditional
industry
such
as
manufacturing
or
agriculture
or
newer
industry
such
as
biomedicine
and
space
technology
by
create
a
number
of
these
small
technology
base
university
we
could
generate
some
of
the
late
technological
innovation
material
process
and
production
method
and
thereby
gain
a
competitive
advantage
in
a
number
of
industry
both
business
and
educational
institution
should
have
a
vital
interest
in
establish
and
participate
in
university
of
the
kind
that
i
be
suggest
it
s
what
we
do
at
magna
several
year
ago
when
we
create
the
stronach
centre
for
innovation
a
centre
that
involves
the
collaboration
of
magna
the
government
eight
university
four
college
and
a
public
private
r
d
consortium
know
as
auto
together
we
have
developed
north
america
s
first
combine
innovation
training
and
commercialization
initiative
the
kind
of
small
more
agile
more
focus
university
that
we
need
to
succeed
in
today
s
global
economy
the
centre
teach
advanced
skill
in
automotive
engineering
and
production
and
be
currently
work
on
the
commercialization
of
promising
new
green
technology
for
the
automotive
industry
as
well
as
electronics
and
new
composite
material
the
objective
of
the
stronach
centre
for
innovation
or
scfi
for
short
will
be
to
graduate
well
round
business

what
we
call
innovation
manager
who
can
successfully
bring

into
the
global
marketplace
by
turn
cut
edge
research
and
technical
knowledge
into
marketable
product
it
s
a
model
for
how
business
and
academia
can
come
together
to
create
new
and
apply
knowledge
for
the
benefit
of

scfi
project
include
everything
from
create

to
use

to

we
re
even
work
on
an
advanced

to
turn

into

technology
that
we
ll
roll
out
in
our
own
division
first
and
then
launch
as
a
new
business
the
centre
also
run
think
tank
for
our
various

and
building

every
business
talk
about
the
need
for
innovation
but
how
do
a
business
actually
go
about
create
new
and
innovative
product
one
thing
be
certain
innovation
doesn
t
come
from

from

worker
the
people
who
be
closest
to

that
s
why
several
year
ago
i
create
a
program
call
win
innovation
or
win
for
short
that
take
the

them
into

tell

that
we
want
to
help
turn
their
idea
into
successful

in
the
process
we
will
let
them
share

the
potential

idea
not
only
have
the

in
the

but
also
start
their

with

as
a

we
re
give

a
once
in
a
lifetime
chance
to

in

your
career
or
your
business
that
first
chore
the
chore
that
blister
my
hand
and
test
my
determination
also
sear
into
me
the
quality
i
need
to

toolmaker
it
be
a
task

to
teach
precision
perseverance
and
perfection
quality
that
have
help
me
throughout
my
career
in
many
way
i
ve
never
stop
filing
i
ve
be
filing
my
whole
life
tie
compensation
to
performance
it
use
to
be
that
the
more
job
you
create
the
more
sale
and
profit
you
generate
the
more
money
you
make
but
in
today
s
business
world
it
seem
that
the

people
you
lay
off
the
more
plant
you
close
and
job
you
kill
the
more
money
you
make
we
ve
get
it
backwards
the
business
leader
or
executive
we
should
really
reward
be
the
one
who
create
job
and
produce
a
profit
chapter
the
quality
of
a
successful
manager
it
s
up
to
management
to
prove
to
employee
day
in
and
day
out
that
the
company
be
a
fair
operator
at
magna
we
let
manager
run
their
own
shop
that
have
always
be
one
of
the
hallmark
of
our
entrepreneurial
culture
the
manager
call
the
shot
on
a
number
of
production
issue
and
run
the
factory
as
if
it
be
their
own
business
but
in
return
for
that
autonomy
the
manager
have
to
uphold
a
few
basic
but
very
important
principle
the
first
principle
be
to
keep
the
worker
happy
as
chairman
of
magna
i
constantly
preach
to
our
manager
about
their
responsibility
to
the
worker
i
told
them
their
job
be
akin
to
be
the
captain
of
a
ship
and
as
a
captain
you
must
look
after
your
passenger
if
there
be
labour
unrest
within
the
division
if
there
be
grumble
about
unfairness
or
bad
work
condition
then
it
s
a
clear
sign
that
the
manager
isn
t
on
top
of
thing
the
worker
on
the
shop
floor
be
the
beating
heart
of
your
organization
and
if
they
re
unhappy
it
mean
the
manager
doesn
t
have
a
feel
for
the
pulse
of
the
workplace
he
or
she
doesn
t
spend
enough
time
on
the
factory
floor
speak
with
employee
to
find
out
their
concern
i
always
use
to
say
to
my
manager
don
t
get
hole
up
in
your
office
get
out
on
the
shop
floor
have
lunch
with
the
worker
you
have
to
be
a
leader
not
a
bos
if
you
re
open
and
honest
with
employee
and
if
you
consult
with
them
they
ll
walk
through
fire
with
you
the
second
basic
principle
be
that
the
manager
have
to
keep
magna
s
shareholder
happy
by
make
a
reasonable
profit
in
essence
it
mean
ensure
that
shareholder
make
a
great
return
on
their
investment
than
if
they
kept
their
money
sit
in
the
bank
or
tie
up
in
government
bond
third
the
manager
have
to
keep
the
customer
happy
by
shipping
quality
product
on
time
without
satisfied
customer
you
haven
t
get
anything
you
might
as
well
close
up
the
shop
a
few
day
after
opening
my
own
tool
and
die
shop
i
land
my
first
customer
the
fellow
who
give
me
the
order
be
an
old
man
and
he
be
very
hesitant
to
hand
over
the
work
he
say
i
don
t
know
if
i
should
give
you
the
job
because
if
you
let
me
down
i
ll
look
awfully
silly
he
didn
t
know
me
at
all
and
i
have
no
track
record
i
be
just
start
out
i
could
see
he
be
uncertain
but
he
decide
to
go
with
his
gut
and
give
me
the
job
so
i
say
to
him
i
won
t
let
you
down
to
me
that
promise
be
more
ironclad
than
any
warranty
or
contract
this
old
manager
stuck
out
his
neck
to
help
a
young
guy
try
to
strike
out
on
his
own
and
there
be
no
way
in
the
world
that
i
be
go
to
let
him
down
for
me
it
wasn
t
even
a
question
of
not
get
paid
it
be
a
question
of
pride
of
living
up
to
my
commitment
if
i
take
an
order
i
always
stuck
with
it
and
if
i
give
my
word
i
always
make
good
on
that
promise
in
those
early
year
i
never
miss
a
deadline
sometimes
we
come
very
close
but
we
somehow
always
manage
to
deliver
the
part
on
time
and
over
time
magna
gain
a
well
deserve
reputation
for
customer
service
we
become
know
in
the
industry
as
the
company
that
always
get
the
job
do
the
company
that
always
come
through
manage
mean
teach
lead
by
example
as
the
manager
you
re
the
number
one
human
resource
guy
the
number
one
finance
guy
the
number
one
technician
you
ve
also
get
to
be
part
psychiatrist
part
lawyer
you
ve
get
to
know
marketing
accounting
engineering
it
s
difficult
to
find
all
of
those
quality
in
one
person
but
they
can
be
learn
over
time
finally
you
ve
get
to
know
the
business
inside
out
you
ve
get
to
have
a
firm
handle
on
all
aspect
of
the
operation
right
down
to
know
where
the
supply
be
store
and
when
the
garbage
get
picked
up
because
when
manager
start
overlook
the
small
detail
that
s
when
thing
begin
to
fall
through
the
crack
and
problem
begin
to
snowball
a
lot
of
the
attribute
necessary
to
succeed
in
business
be
simple
commonsense
principle
such
as
identify
priority
act
decisively
and
living
a
balance
life
they
re
the
key
principle
that
i
ve
follow
throughout
my
career
whenever
i
meet
with
business
student
at
university
and
college
they
always
ask
me
what
i
think
be
the
number
one
attribute
for
business
success
and
i
always
stress
the
importance
of
establish
priority
sort
your
priority
be
critical
for
the
long
term
success
of
both
your
career
and
the
business
you
manage
i
ve
be
in
business
meeting
where
some
of
the
people
at
the
table
be
all
over
the
map
jumping
from
one
thing
to
another
with
no
firm
grasp
or
sense
as
to
what
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
or
their
company
s
key
strategic
priority
perhaps
the
most
important
principle
for
me
be
maintain
balance
the
demand
and
pressure
of
business
can
be
enormous
and
can
take
a
toll
on
your
personal
life
when
i
be
grow
our
business
in
the
early
year
my
wife
elfriede
take
care
of
the
household
and
look
after
raise
our
two
child
leave
me
free
to
dedicate
a
large
portion
of
my
time
and
energy
on
building
magna
i
believe
i
be
a
good
father
but
in
hindsight
i
wish
i
have
spent
more
time
with
my
kid
that
s
why
it
s
so
important
to
carve
out
time
to
spend
with
your
family
and
time
to
recharge
through
hobby
sport
and
other
leisure
pursuit
for
me
it
s
my
passion
for
horse
that
provide
a
counterbalance
to
my
business
affair
but
it
could
be
any
other
type
of
activity
not
related
to
business
it
provide
you
with
the
opportunity
to
take
a
breather
so
you
can
tackle
business
problem
with
a
refresh
mind
and
a
reinvigorate
spirit
to
be
a
good
manager
you
ve
also
get
to
have
a
knack
for
know
people
and
for
pick
the
right
person
for
the
job
as
a
young
boy
during
the
second
world
war
i
be
force
to
grow
up
very
quickly
i
learn
to
rely
on
my
wit
to
avoid
potentially
dangerous
situation
and
when
you
live
in
a
constant
state
of
tension
like
that
you
develop
a
radar
you
re
always
alert
razor
sharp
like
an
animal
that
be
be
hunt
you
detect
danger
and
pick
up
warn
signal
immediately
and
you
acquire
a
surefire
instinct
for
judging
people
who
can
be
trust
who
be
the
good
guy
who
s
get
a
chip
on
their
shoulder
or
harbour
ill
will
you
begin
to
develop
a
finely
tune
sense
for
spot
these
quality
and
attribute
in
people
but
if
your
life
have
be
all
smooth
sail
with
no
ups
and
down
you
ll
probably
never
develop
the
same
sharp
instinct
the
same
radar
the
funny
thing
be
we
never
want
our
own
child
to
experience
hardship
or
humiliation
or
hunger
but
in
the
end
those
experience
infuse
certain
trait
and
attribute
that
make
them
strong
savvier
the
thing
i
ve
see
the
experience
i
ve
endure
you
could
never
learn
the
lesson
those
experience
impart
from
the
page
of
a
book
you
cannot
teach
shrewdness
or
toughness
they
re
the
kind
of
quality
you
can
only
acquire
by
be
in
the
trench
by
be
expose
to
harsh
and
sometimes
severe
condition
when
i
open
my
own
business
one
of
the
reason
i
be
successful
very
early
on
be
that
i
have
a
talent
for
pick
the
right
people
people
who
have
the
right
quality
and
disposition
need
for
perform
certain
job
i
believe
it
s
because
i
have
acquire
a
keen
sense
for
reading
people
earlier
in
life
for
assess
their
character
and
size
them
up
of
course
i
wasn
t
always
right
i
sometimes
hire
the
wrong
person
or
i
completely
misjudge
someone
on
occasion
especially
early
in
my
career
i
ran
into
a
few
bad
apple
that
never
paid
me
for
the
work
i
do
but
i
chalked
all
of
it
up
to
experience
in
any
aspect
of
life
or
in
any
field
of
human
endeavour
you
ll
always
find
good
people
and
not
so
good
people
but
on
the
whole
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
ve
have
the
fortune
of
work
alongside
many
good
and
decent
people
people
who
be
loyal
and
true
to
their
word
to
be
sure
i
ve
make
my
share
of
mistake
over
the
year
look
back
i
think
most
of
them
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
sometimes
trust
people
too
much
it
s
part
of
my
nature
i
guess
but
i
wouldn
t
change
it
even
if
i
could
the
thing
be
you
have
to
trust
people
and
you
have
to
give
them
the
freedom
and
space
to
act
independently
and
to
succeed
on
their
own
this
approach
have
paid
more
dividend
than
disappointment
for
me
at
magna
i
always
give
people
who
work
alongside
me
a
lot
of
leeway
and
room
to
grow
if
i
have
to
spoon
feed
everyone
i
hire
i
never
could
have
make
magna
as
large
as
it
be
i
often
hire
people
on
the
basis
of
their
character
as
much
as
or
more
than
on
the
content
of
their
r
sum
s
and
you
can
often
glimpse
a
person
s
true
character
in
the
way
they
treat
people
they
consider
to
be
below
them
or
the
way
they
treat
people
who
be
serve
them
like
the
big
shot
in
a
restaurant
who
tear
a
strip
off
a
waitress
because
the
meal
he
order
wasn
t
cooked
perfectly
or
take
a
long
time
to
arrive
when
you
start
out
in
life
at
the
very
bottom
when
you
wash
dish
or
sweep
floor
or
clean
toilet
you
re
a
lot
less
likely
to
act
that
way
toward
someone
serve
you
you
look
at
the
people
who
do
those
job
with
a
great
degree
of
sympathy
understand
and
respect
when
hire
people
the
one
quality
i
prize
above
all
others
be
attitude
i
believe
that
have
a
positive
outlook
and
attitude
be
critical
attitude
can
spell
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
between
overcome
what
look
like
an
insurmountable
problem
and
be
overwhelmed
by
despair
and
defeat
with
the
right
frame
of
mind
any
problem
can
be
solve
that
approach
to
hire
have
serve
me
well
over
the
year
and
it
s
one
that
i
still
rely
on
today
attitude
and
character
trump
every
skill
or
talent
every
educational
degree
or
type
of
training
every
kind
of
experience
magna
be
built
on
the
never
say
die
can
do
attitude
of
its
people
motivate
great
manager
be
great
motivator
a
manager
have
to
motivate
employee
to
think
and
they
will
only
think
if
their
heart
be
in
the
business
in
the
end
it
be
the
company
that

chapter
the
achilles
heel
of
democracy
we
as
a
people
don
t
recognize
that
government
be
the
management
team
of
a
country
and
the
primary
motivation
of
a
politician
be
to
be
elect
or
re
elect
the
result
be
that
the
country
end
up
be
manage
via
political
rather
than
socio
economic
reason
it
s
what
i
call
the
achilles
heel
of
democracy
over
the
year
i
ve
met
many
politician
from
many
different
country
everyone
from
senator
and
president
to
prime
minister
and
chancellor
i
ve
get
nothing
against
politician
my
daughter
be
one
and
although
most
politician
mean
well
and
want
to
serve
the
country
the
primary
mandate
of
a
politician
be
to
be
elect
or
re
elect
so
the
dilemma
we
in
western
democracy
face
be
that
government
must
manage
the
country
but
its
decision
be
driven
primarily
by
political
reason
it
s
what
i
call
the
achilles
heel
of
democracy
the
result
be
that
our
country
to
a
great
extent
be
manage
by
a
short
term
political
decision
make
process
what
we
need
to
do
be
find
a
way
to
counterbalance
the
political
management
of
the
country
with
some
socio
economic
think
if
we
could
find
a
way
to
do
that
we
could
make
government
more
effective
in
business
you
re
constantly
think
can
we
make
a
well
product
or
well
service
for
a
well
price
but
government
should
also
follow
this
line
of
think
can
we
govern
more
efficiently
can
we
improve
living
standard
and
close
the
grow
gap
between
the
wealthy
and
the
worker
i
believe
we
can
and
the
government
reform
i
ve
propose
ever
since
run
for
office
over
two
decade
ago
be
the
creation
of
a
new
chamber
of
citizen
representative
democratically
elect
citizen
who
would
provide
a
healthy
counterbalance
to
the
power
of
political
party
here
s
how
it
would
work
under
my
proposal
citizen
representative
would
represent
voter
from
two
exist
electoral
district
use
to
elect
political
representative
the
two
electoral
district
would
be
combine
for
the
purpose
of
elect
citizen
representative
as
a
result
there
would
be
one
citizen
representative
for
every
two
political
representative
or
half
as
many
citizen
representative
as
the
total
number
of
elect
politician
next
a
computer
would
randomly
select
a
list
of
candidate
for
the
position
of
citizen
representative
in
each
of
the
combine
electoral
district
much
like
the
process
use
to
select
citizen
for
jury
duty
from
that
list
twenty
or
so
citizen
above
the
age
of
who
want
to
serve
their
country
and
stand
for
election
would
allow
their
name
to
be
put
forward
as
candidate
for
the
chamber
of
citizen
representative
these
candidate
would
be
farmer
and
hairdresser
and
store
manager
and
technician
regular
people
with
practical
real
world
experience
under
their
belt
they
would
issue
a
one
page
r
sum
profile
their
background
and
work
experience
and
the
r
sum
s
would
be
circulate
to
all
of
the
household
in
the
district
voter
would
then
elect
one
to
serve
as
their
citizen
representative
the
concept
of
citizen
representative
be
as
old
as
democracy
itself
in
ancient
athens
citizen
representative
be
chosen
by
way
of
a
random
draw
the
same
process
we
still
use
today
when
select
jury
these
citizen
juror
would
take
up
their
role
in
government
as
part
of
their
civic
duty
and
would
only
have
to
sit
in
parliament
or
congress
a
total
of
about
fifteen
day
per
year
to
vote
on
major
bill
they
would
not
have
to
give
up
their
regular
job
and
would
be
compensate
for
the
time
they
spend
as
citizen
representative
and
just
like
with
jury
duty
employer
would
be
require
by
law
to
give
the
citizen
representative
time
off
to
serve
their
country
after
have
serve
one
full
term
the
citizen
representative
would
then
return
to
private
life
although
they
would
not
be
involve
in
formulate
policy
citizen
representative
would
have
a
significant
say
in
approve
major
legislation
citizen
representative
would
vote
only
on
major
bill
everything
from
budget
to
health
care
and
taxation
and
they
would
cast
their
vote
at
the
same
time
as
the
elect
politician
the
two
separate
set
of
vote
would
then
be
add
together
a
simple
majority
of
vote
would
be
require
to
pas
a
bill
however
unlike
the
political
representative
citizen
representative
would
vote
by
way
of
a
secret
ballot
this
would
insulate
them
from
any
personal
inducement
or
reprisal
they
might
be
subject
to
if
their
vote
be
make
public
the
addition
of
citizen
representative
would
make
government
much
more
effective
and
accountable
the
political
party
with
the
most
elect
member
would
still
posse
the
mandate
to
form
the
government
and
bring
forth
legislation
however
for
every
piece
of
legislation
introduce
by
the
government
the
opposition
party
would
be
require
to
submit
an
alternative
bill
on
the
same
issue
this
important
requirement
the
mandatory
table
of
alternative
legislation
would
enable
the
opposition
to
go
beyond
the
role
of
critic
by
offering
constructive
option
to
government
legislation
in
other
word
the
opposition
would
be
force
to
become
part
of
the
solution
this
reform
would
also
go
a
long
way
toward
eliminate
the
political
grandstand
and
knee
jerk
obstructionism
built
into
our
present
system
remove
from
the
straitjacket
of
party
discipline
remove
from
the
influence
of
special
interest
citizen
representative
would
bring
a
much
more
pragmatic
approach
to
manage
the
affair
of
the
country
i
strongly
believe
this
new
political
framework
would
address
the
structural
shortcoming
of
our
present
system
by
blending
short
term
political
imperative
with
much
need
longer
term
socio
economic
consideration
what
s
more
citizen
representative
would
be
much
more
inclined
to
place
the
country
s
socio
economic
welfare
and
long
term
national
interest
ahead
of
political
consideration
or
partisan
view
since
they
wouldn
t
be
beholden
to
any
political
party
or
leader
they
would
have
one
override
goal
or
objective
the
best
interest
of
the
country
the
great
statesman
and
parliamentarian
winston
churchill
at
one
time
advocate
a
concept
similar
to
the
chamber
of
citizen
representative
churchill
thought
that
partisan
politics
and
political
brawling
make
the
party
dominate
house
of
common
unsuited
to
deal
with
economic
matter
of
national
importance
in
plain
english
churchill
felt
we
have
too
many
politician
he
argue
for
the
creation
of
a
non
political
body
or
chamber
because
he
believe
that
elect
politician
would
always
put
their
own
short
term
political
interest
ahead
of
the
long
term
economic
interest
of
the
country
my
government
reform
proposal
would
certainly
go
a
long
way
toward
eliminate
many
of
the
dysfunctional
aspect
of
our
current
system
where
political
pork
barrelling
take
precedence
over
economic
consideration
where
the
public
will
to
curtail
spending
and
hold
the
line
on
tax
increase
be
ignore
and
where
taxpayer
watch
helplessly
on
the
sideline
as
government
ram
through
spending
bill
and
other
piece
of
legislation
that
hit
people
in
their
pocketbook
and
have
long
term
negative
consequence
for
our
economy
and
standard
of
living
our
system
of
government
be
broken
and
everyone
can
feel
it
in
their
bone
of
this
you
can
be
sure
country
that
place
political
wrangle
and
partisan
issue
ahead
of
economic
imperative
will
suffer
low
living
standard
in
the
year
ahead
but
those
country
that
have
an
effective
management
system
in
place
for
deal
with
national
and
global
issue
will
prosper
because
the
well
be
of
a
nation
ultimately
depends
upon
the
strength
of
its
economic
fabric
we
need
to
ensure
that
the
management
decision
of
government
be
also
driven
by
economic
consideration
by
modernize
our
government
management
system
we
could
reinvigorate
and
redemocratize
our
political
institution
and
loosen
the
bottleneck
that
have
stymie
real
economic
progress
we
would
finally
break
free
from
the
paralysis
of
party
politics
the
chamber
of
citizen
representative
would
help
depoliticize
the
run
of
the
country
and
it
would
bring
new
idea
to
the
table
of
government
we
would
slowly
rid
ourselves
of
empty
politics
and
put
the
run
of
the
country
on
the
straight
and
narrow
who
wouldn
t
vote
for
that
promote
lifestyle
education
and
sport
character
we
need
to
look
at
the
many
non
academic
aspect
of
education
that
help
develop
well
adjust
citizen
who
will
contribute
to
the
social
and
economic
well
be
of
society
later
in
life
i
call
this
approach
lifestyle
education
the
teach
of
basic
principle
such
as
nutrition
that
will
enable
young
people
to
lead
healthy
balance
and
productive
life
this
approach
include
instill
a
sport
character
in
student
through
a
great
focus
on
sport
activity
and
other
athletic
endeavour

i
believe
that
individual
everywhere
have
two
basic
desire
first
they
want
to
have
personal
freedom
which
in
essence
mean
they
want
the
right
to
choose
their
own
road
to
happiness
second
they
want
economic
freedom
which
mean
they
want
to
be
financially
independent
i
get
great
pleasure
talk
to
student
their
mind
be
wide
open
and
they
re
hungry
to
learn
some
of
the
secret
of
my
success
whenever
i
give
a
talk
to
college
or
university
student
i
always
begin
by
say
that
success
in
life
can
only
be
measure
by
the
degree
of
happiness
you
reach
and
then
i
always
add
but
let
me
tell
you
in
my
experience
it
s
a
lot
easy
to
be
happy
if
you
have
some
money
the
really
eager
student
ask
me
what
it
take
to
get
to
the
top
to
be
the
best
when
you
re
in
your
early
twenty
you
don
t
really
know
yourself
so
you
ve
get
to
try
your
hand
at
many
different
job
in
order
to
find
your
niche
i
tell
student
find
out
what
you
like
to
do
and
then
set
out
to
be
the
best
in
your
field
pursue
what
make
you
happy
because
you
can
t
be
good
at
anything
if
your
heart
s
not
in
it
but
if
you
enjoy
do
something
chance
be
you
ll
do
it
well
and
if
you
give
an
extra
effort
chance
be
you
could
be
among
the
very
best
at
what
you
do
when
you
do
something
you
enjoy
and
you
do
it
exceedingly
well
money
and
success
be
simply
by
product
for
people
think
about
start
their
own
business
my
advice
be
to
do
some
research
and
consider
your
own
experience
purchasing
various
product
and
service
there
s
an
enormous
amount
of
mediocrity
in
the
marketplace
and
we
ve
all
felt
the
frustration
of
buying
a
bad
product
or
get
poor
service
zero
in
on
an
area
where
you
think
you
can
do
something
well
the
opportunity
be
endless
but
before
you
start
your
own
business
you
ve
get
to
work
in
that
field
or
industry
for
a
few
year
to
learn
the
nitty
gritty
detail
all
the
in
and
out
if
you
borrow
money
make
sure
you
have
the
ability
to
pay
it
back
so
you
can
start
over
if
the
business
fails
once
your
business
be
up
and
run
don
t
spend
more
than
you
bring
in
and
always
sock
some
money
away
for
a
rainy
day
i
ve
never
yet
see
a
business
with
money
in
the
bank
that
go
broke
i
be
once
on
a
business
panel
with
some
other
entrepreneur
discuss
the
topic
of
start
your
own
business
a
man
in
the
audience
stood
up
and
complain
bitterly
to
the
panel
about
how
the
bank
be
unfair
and
discriminatory
have
turn
him
down
for
a
loan
to
start
a
business
a
lot
of
the
people
in
the
crowd
agree
say
the
bank
be
to
blame
for
not
give
them
the
start
up
capital
they
need
so
i
ask
the
man
who
have
griped
about
unfair
treatment
how
much
of
your
own
money
be
you
go
to
put
up
and
he
say
none
i
reply
why
would
the
bank
lend
you
some
money
if
you
re
not
willing
to
invest
in
your
own
business
as
soon
as
i
say
that
the
room
go
quiet
i
then
told
the
audience
of
would
be
entrepreneur
that
start
your
own
business
be
a
lot
of
long
hour
and
hard
work
and
cut
back
on
your
living
expense
not
the
sort
of
advice
they
be
hop
to
hear
when
you
have
a
small
company
you
ve
get
to
do
everything
but
when
you
get
a
little
big
when
you
re
no
longer
involve
in
all
of
the
minute
detail
that
s
when
business
ownership
start
to
become
more
enjoyable
at
that
point
business
isn
t
work
anymore
it
s
more
like
play
a
sport
create
job
and
give
people
the
chance
to
do
what
they
love
to
do
that
be
for
me
one
of
the
richest
reward
of
run
my
own
business
but
probably
the
most
important
bit
of
advice
i
give
to
would
be
entrepreneur
and
young
people
strike
out
on
their
own
be
the
follow
sell
your
wristwatch
and
buy
an
alarm
clock
own
and
operating
a
business
mean
a
lot
of
early
morning
and
long
hour
and
late
night
if
you
want
to
run
your
own
business
you
have
well
forget
about
nine
to
five
workday
and
weekend
off
it
s
a
sacrifice
that
most
people
be
not
willing
to
make
there
be
many
path
to
success
but
no
short
cut
over
the
course
of
my
career
i
sacrifice
a
great
deal
and
work
very
hard
invest
a
lot
of
time
and
money
to
build
a
business
but
i
do
this
so
that
i
could
make
the
business
a
success
and
eventually
reap
the
reward
of
that
success
by
attain
economic
freedom
that
s
what
drove
me
it
s
why
i
strongly
believe
that
society
must
ensure
that
there
be
a
reward
system
for
entrepreneur
if
there
be
no
tangible
financial
reward
associate
with
start
a
business
then
no
one
in
their
right
mind
would
risk
their
hard
earn
saving
and
the
enormous
investment
of
personal
time
and
effort
require
to
build
a
business
from
the
ground
up
consider
the
industry
i
ve
work
in
most
of
my
life
why
would
anyone
invest
money
to
build
a
factory
buy
machine
and
hire
employee
to
manufacture
product
if
they
could
make
more
money
by
buying
government
bond
most
individual
who
start
a
business
from
scratch
pay
a
heavy
price
and
face
fairly
tough
odds
of
succeed
that
s
why
the
reward
have
to
be
substantial
one
of
my
main
concern
nowadays
be
that
we
re
create
an
economic
environment
that
be
no
longer
conducive
to
entrepreneurship
we
re
strangle
the
market
s
creative
force
the
entrepreneur
and
inventor
who
create
wealth
and
we
re
kill
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
could
a
young
entrepreneur
build
a
company
like
magna
in
today
s
over
regulate
environment
i
m
not
quite
sure
he
or
she
could
i
m
always
leery
of
people
who
say
money
doesn
t
matter
the
truth
be
money
can
be
a
great
motivator
even
if
it
be
only
a
tool
for
achieve
other
end
and
money
can
never
be
your
only
goal
as
soon
as
you
become
preoccupy
with
only
make
money
there
s
no
way
you
can
achieve
greatness
or
excellence
our
society
need
people
who
go
out
on
a
limb
to
invent
and
develop
new
product
and
service
people
who
push
their
physical
and
mental
ability
to
the
limit
in
order
to
advance
society
and
improve
living
condition
i
have
a
concern
however
that
we
re
slowly
stamp
out
all
the
reward
that
encourage
people
to
become
entrepreneur
and
inventor
if
we
remove
the
incentive
to
strike
out
on
your
own
then
we
ll
lose
a
critical
element
of
what
drive
wealth
creation
when
i
look
back
at
my
own
career
and
add
up
all
the
hour
i
work
it
s
incredible
really
there
be
time
when
i
work
two
or
three
day
and
night
straight
to
finish
an
order
during
the
early
year
of
my
business
i
d
occasionally
take
a
brief
break
while
work
on
a
saturday
or
sunday
i
would
sit
under
an
old
chestnut
tree
outside
the
factory
to
get
some
fresh
air
and
sunshine
i
d
see
young
couple
buying
some
ice
cream
or
go
to
a
movie
and
i
d
sometimes
think
why
be
i
do
this
i
be
stuck
there
bashing
metal
to
meet
a
deadline
wish
i
hadn
t
take
the
order
hadn
t
make
that
promise
to
a
customer
but
when
you
re
in
business
for
yourself
especially
when
you
re
young
you
have
to
sacrifice
you
ve
get
to
knuckle
under
and
take
some
lump
along
the
way
run
and
grow
the
business
be
like
be
on
a
merry
go
round
you
get
on
and
it
go
faster
and
faster
and
it
sometimes
seem
that
you
can
t
get
off
but
that
s
the
beauty
of
be
your
own
bos
of
building
your
own
business
there
come
a
time
when
you
decide
to
slow
down
to
get
off
the
merry
go
round
and
have
the
freedom
to
do
whatever
you
want
that
s
what
i
do
when
i
cashed
out
at
magna
i
built
magna
so
that
i
could
one
day
be
economically
free
and
through
the
fair
enterprise
success
share
engine
i
create
i
want
to
give
everyone
else
who
work
there
a
shot
at
economic
freedom
as
well
if
i
could
do
it
all
over
again
i
d
do
some
thing
a
little
differently
no
question
but
i
d
do
it
all
over
just
the
same
although
i
paid
a
heavy
price
the
reward
be
immeasurable
and
the
reward
i
treasure
above
all
others
be
my
economic
freedom
i
be
free
totally
free
and
there
be
no
great
feel
in
the
world
than
that
know
your
employee
manager
must
know
their
employee
and
the
only
way
you
can
know
your
employee
be
if
you
be
always
on
the
floor
with
them
it
s
also
critical
that
a
manager
maintain
an
environment
where
employee
can
talk
about
problem
that
arise
in
the
workplace
that
way
if
something
isn
t
right
you
can
flush
it
out
and
deal
with
it
and
a
good
manager
will
always
encourage
employee
to
come
forward
with
new
idea
and
constructive
criticism
chapter
if
the
turtle
didn
t
stick
its
neck
out
good
manager
don
t
fall
from
the
sky
during
the
course
of
my
career
i
ve
do
a
lot
of
deal
with
japanese
business
people
and
magna
have
sign
a
number
of
strategic
partnership
with
japanese
company
over
the
year
when
i
have
lunch
with
japanese
business
leader
they
often
say
to
me
you
know
frank
we
feel
sorry
for
you
business
executive
in
europe
and
north
america
you
re
always
under
the
gun
to
boost
short
term
profit
for
your
shareholder
and
you
have
to
manage
your
company
on
a
quarterly
basis
it
must
be
pretty
hard
to
set
a
course
for
the
future
and
to
a
great
extent
the
japanese
be
right
for
some
shareholder
especially
those
driven
by
short
term
profit
take
the
roller
coaster
fluctuation
of
a
stock
price
during
the
course
of
a
few
hour
can
feel
like
a
lifetime
most
of
the
shareholder
of
large
public
company
today
be
mammoth
financial
institution
and
pension
fund
and
these
institutional
shareholder
be
focus
mainly
on
maximize
short
term
result
and
quarterly
profit
they
don
t
want
to
see
a
company
branching
out
into
a
new
line
of
business
for
example
since
that
carry
a
large
element
of
risk
and
eats
into
the
short
term
profit
they
also
don
t
want
to
see
a
company
plow
too
much
money
into
product
research
and
development
for
the
same
reason
it
reduces
short
term
profitability
even
if
the
r
d
initiative
have
the
potential
to
return
great
profit
year
later
so
the
dilemma
face
by
the
manager
of
large
public
company
in
the
west
be
this
how
do
the
company
balance
the
need
to
boost
profit
in
the
short
term
while
still
invest
in
the
future
and
keep
all
of
the
company
s
stakeholder
pull
in
the
same
direction
as
the
founder
and
former
control
shareholder
of
magna
i
always
look
down
the
road
not
just
five
or
ten
year
but
even
twenty
year
and
beyond
and
that
mean
plant
some
seed
in
the
ground
today
if
you
want
to
see
them
come
to
fruition
in
ten
or
twenty
year
it
s
like
the
walnut
business
if
you
want
to
be
a
supplier
of
walnut
you
ve
get
to
wait
about
twenty
five
or
thirty
year
before
the
tree
be
full
grown
and
you
re
able
to
start
harvest
your
product
the
same
hold
true
in
business
with
the
exception
that
you
can
t
ignore
short
term
productivity
and
profitability
and
from
the
shareholder
s
point
of
view
the
short
term
mean
the
current
quarter
so
as
a
business
manager
and
leader
you
try
to
achieve
a
balance
between
shareholder
short
term
interest
and
the
longer
term
interest
of
the
company
a
business
leader
have
to
think
about
all
of
the
firm
s
stakeholder
and
ask
the
follow
question
what
do
we
have
to
do
to
maintain
and
create
job
which
direction
be
our
industry
head
what
be
the
new
technology
and
product
on
the
horizon
in
other
word
what
research
do
you
have
to
carry
out
today
to
still
be
in
business
a
decade
later
because
research
be
the
foundation
of
the
future
at
magna
because
i
be
the
control
shareholder
our
executive
didn
t
always
have
a
gun
point
at
their
head
to
produce
short
term
profit
we
could
undertake
certain
business
project
or
development
know
that
they
might
not
make
a
profit
for
a
few
year
we
be
also
able
to
sit
down
and
plan
for
five
to
ten
and
even
twenty
year
down
the
road
without
the
enormous
pressure
that
some
firm
face
for
example
we
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
development
of
our
large
automotive
system
group
back
in
the
s
when
i
establish
magna
s
unique
corporate
constitution
i
make
research
and
development
one
of
the
key
pillar
long
before
product
innovation
become
a
business
buzzword
the
r
d
principle
of
magna
s
constitution
require
that
the
company
allocate
a
minimum
of
percent
of
its
profit
before
tax
to
ensure
magna
s
long
term
viability
company
that
don
t
invest
in
the
future
be
doom
to
fail
there
s
simply
no
way
they
can
continue
to
compete
with
obsolete
technology
and
outdated
product
especially
in
the
innovation
driven
world
of
business
today
in
the
end
the
successful
firm
be
the
one
that
find
a
way
to
manage
both
the
short
term
need
of
shareholder
and
the
long
term
need
of
new
business
development
balance
be
the
most
important
word
in
my
vocabulary
the
state
i
pursue
in
my
personal
life
and
in
business
and
balance
should
be
the
most
important
goal
of
any
business
manager
whether
it
s
balance
present
objective
with
future
goal
or
balance
the
need
of
different
stakeholder
balance
be
one
of
the
key
feature
of
the
corporate
constitution
i
create
it
attempt
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
right
of
management
employee
and
shareholder
the
three
drive
force
of
our
business
if
there
be
no
balance
it
s
only
a
matter
of
time
before
thing
begin
to
break
down
and
the
business
no
longer
function
properly
i
think
success
in
business
be
really
a
question
of
common
sense
when
you
boil
it
right
down
business
be
not
that
difficult
or
complicate
it
s
really
all
about
solve
problem
this
be
well
capture
in
the
joke
about
the
business
owner
who
ran
a
job
ad
for
the
position
of
ceo
the
ad
read
look
for
someone
to
run
my
business
and
take
all
my
worry
off
my
hand
will
pay
a
salary
of
million
per
year
the
owner
interviewed
a
number
of
candidate
and
then
select
the
person
who
would
become
the
new
ceo
at
the
conclusion
of
the
interview
the
two
men
shook
hand
the
owner
say
now
that
i
ve
found
someone
who
will
take
care
of
all
my
worry
i
can
step
down
and
retire
before
you
begin
do
you
have
any
question
yes
say
the
newly
hire
ceo
how
do
i
get
paid
the
owner
reply
that
s
your
first
worry
be
decisive
be
another
factor
that
be
critical
to
success
over
the
course
of
my
career
once
i
reach
a
conclusion
once
i
analyze
something
and
weigh
the
pro
and
con
i
come
to
a
decision
and
didn
t
turn
back
too
many
people
after
they
ve
make
a
decision
begin
to
waffle
and
second
guess
you
ve
get
to
go
through
some
soul
search
and
careful
analysis
but
once
you
ve
make
up
your
mind
and
make
a
commitment
move
forward
and
follow
through
otherwise
you
can
never
achieve
anything
several
year
ago
we
make
the
strategic
decision
to
move
into
russia
in
a
big
way
there
be
a
lot
of
risk
attach
but
after
painstaking
research
we
determine
that
russia
be
where
we
could
really
grow
our
business
we
ve
be
opening
more
and
more
factory
in
russia
which
be
on
track
to
surpass
germany
as
europe
s
large
producer
of
vehicle
i
ve
met
president
vladimir
putin
on
several
occasion
he
s
very
sharp
a
good
listener
with
a
dry
sense
of
humour
he
come
to
one
of
our
official
opening
a
few
year
back
surround
by
camera
reporter
aide
and
security
personnel
he
spoke
to
me
in
fluent
german
and
ask
me
to
explain
to
magna
s
new
russian
employee
why
we
open
a
plant
in
russia
and
what
our
plan
for
the
future
be
he
then
proceed
to
translate
every
word
i
say
into
russian
i
sincerely
believe
he
want
to
build
a
robust
middle
class
in
russia
because
the
middle
class
be
the
backbone
of
a
strong
economy
and
a
healthy
democracy
but
he
s
get
a
very
difficult
job
in
front
of
him
and
russia
will
go
through
a
lot
of
grow
pain
naturally
there
will
be
time
when
you
make
a
wrong
turn
or
go
down
a
dead
end
but
even
then
you
can
t
allow
yourself
to
get
bogged
down
by
indecision
and
second
guess
you
have
to
pause
briefly
and
look
back
to
learn
from
the
past
but
after
that
you
ve
get
to
continue
stride
into
the
future
in
the
end
the
most
vital
undertaking
of
any
manager
be
measure
risk
and
make
the
call
on
whether
to
proceed
with
a
plan
or
not
it
s
about
have
the
smart
to
calculate
risk
and
the
gut
to
go
forward
know
all
the
while
that
the
knife
will
come
out
if
the
plan
fails
throughout
my
career
i
ve
have
to
butt
head
with
people
inside
and
outside
the
company
who
always
come
up
with
a
thousand
good
reason
for
not
do
something
along
the
way
i
make
my
share
of
mistake
of
course
as
i
ve
say
if
i
could
do
it
all
over
again
i
would
do
some
thing
differently
but
a
number
of
the
project
i
champion
be
home

they
open
up
new
terrain
for
the
company

we
not
venture

all
those

always

why
it

we
have
to
be

that

overreact
in

of

increasingly

a
critical
tool
for

the

concern
about
excessively

also
applies
to
large
more
mature
company
in
order
to
compete
in

these
multinational

only
handcuff

even
more
without
get
to
the
root
of
the
problem
i
believe
we
should
consider
something
much
simpler
we
should
bar
top
executive
of
public
company
from
cash
in
their
stock
option
until
a
minimum
length
of
time
have
elapse
after
they
ve
left
the
firm
about
eighteen
month
and
only
after
they
ve
undergone
a
full
independent
audit
this
would
ensure
that
they
wouldn
t
be
reward
for
action
that
damage
the
firm
s
profitability
and
slash
the
value
of
every
other
investor
s
stockholding
if
the
book
be
cooked
if
there
be
any
financial
impropriety
it
would
bubble
to
the
surface
within
a
year
in
other
word
senior
manager
should
be
require
to
undergo
a
vest
period
after
leave
the
company
before
be
able
to
sell
their

this
vest
rule
would
apply
at
a
minimum
to
the
chief
executive
officer
the
chief
financial
officer
and
the
chief
operating

the

quickly
come
to
an

motivate

blow
to

the

saga
start
with
the
acquisition
of

in
when
the

open
in

out
hop
to
turn
a
long
shot
bet
into
some
winning
and
when
we
bought
it
in
the
late
s
the
great
race
place
be
still
one
of
the
shrine
of
thoroughbred
race
the
first
time
i
ever
go
to
santa
anita
park
be
when
i
ship
my
champion
thoroughbred
glorious
song
there
to
take
part
in
a
big
money
stake
race
back
in
the
late
s
i
couldn
t
even
get
into
the
director
s
room
the
fancy
lounge
and
restaurant
overlook
the
racetrack
because
i
didn
t
have
a
tie
i
told
myself
that
if
i
ever
happen
to
buy
the
track
one
day
i
would
change
that
policy
and
sure
enough
i
do
when
magna
bought
santa
anita
park
one
of
the
first
thing
i
do
be
to
get
rid
of
the
requirement
that
tie
have
to
be
worn
in
the
director
s
room
i
have
always
have
my
eye
on
santa
anita
park
with
its
art
deco
architecture
and
panoramic
vista
it
be
one
of
the
most
stun
racetrack
in
the
world
the
first
time
it
come
up
for
sale
i
sent
a
due
diligence
team
down
to
scout
it
out
but
i
pull
the
team
once
we
learn
the
ask
price
would
be
astronomical
the
racetrack
end
up
be
sell
to
meditrust
a
health
care
and
real
estate
investment
trust
for
approximately
million
but
then
about
a
year
later
i
get
a
call
from
the
investment
banker
who
have
work
on
the
meditrust
deal
they
ask
me
if
i
be
still
interested
because
meditrust
be
in
a
cash
bind
and
need
to
sell
santa
anita
quickly
i
told
the
banker
to
let
meditrust
know
that
i
wouldn
t
get
involve
in
an
auction
but
if
the
price
be
reasonable
i
could
do
the
deal
in
a
matter
of
week
one
of
the
banker
call
me
back
the
next
day
the
price
tag
million
it
s
a
deal
i
say
both
magna
s
management
and
board
of
director
be
highly
skeptical
at
first
but
once
they
flew
down
to
l
a
to
see
the
track
and
learn
about
the
fire
sale
price
they
begin
to
see
the
merit
in
own
the
property
if
only
for
the
value
of
the
real
estate
acre
of
highly
desirable
prime
development
land
on
the
edge
of
downtown
los
angeles
the
way
i
saw
it
branching
into
game
and
entertainment
would
allow
us
to
diversify
and
create
a
second
economic
base
the
main
concern
of
management
and
the
board
however
be
the
reaction
of
magna
shareholder
the
magna
purchase
of
santa
anita
park
spark
a
fire
storm
in
the
investment
world
and
some
of
magna
s
large
institutional
investor
be
up
in
arm
at
the
annual
shareholder
meeting
i
acknowledge
their
concern
when
investor
buy
automotive
stock
they
don
t
want
pony
thrown
into
the
mix
as
well
so
in
february
magna
make
a
binding
commitment
to
shareholder
that
we
would
not
put
another
penny
of
additional
funding
into
mec
without
their
approval
the
forbearance
agreement
as
it
be
know
be
a
kind
of
financial
firewall
around
magna
assure
shareholder
of
the
automotive
part
company
that
none
of
magna
s
profit
would
get
siphon
away
into
the
game
business
we
live
up
to
the
term
of
agreement
a
month
later
we
turn
mec
into
a
public
company
and
spun
it
out
by
distribute
mec
stock
to
magna
shareholder
who
be
then
free
to
sell
the
stock
or
tuck
it
away
in
their
portfolio
magna
shareholder
end
up
pocket
a
nice
return
on
the
sale
of
their
mec
share
follow
that
mec
become
a
separately
trade
public
company
control
by
magna
a
few
year
later
we
spun
out
the
real
estate
division
mi
development
mid
and
magna
transfer
its
control
interest
in
mec
to
mid
which
have
the
same
dual
class
share
structure
as
magna
with
me
as
the
control
shareholder
it
be
the
start
of
a
bitter
and
protract
war
between
a
number
of
mid
shareholder
primarily
hedge
fund
company
and
me
the
hedge
fund
company
be
only
interested
in
the
secure
and
steady
income
stream
from
mid
s
rental
property
and
they
lobby
hard
for
mid
to
cut
mec
loose
i
didn
t
realize
it
at
the
time
but
it
would
become
one
of
the
factor
that
drag
mec
under
in
the
end
around
the
time
i
form
mec
the
horse
race
industry
be
fragment
with
track
typically
own
and
operate
by
a
lone
individual
or
corporation
in
a
world
where
industry
where
consolidate
the
horse
race
business
be
stuck
in
time
as
a
lead
racehorse
owner
i
race
at
virtually
all
of
the
top
track
in
america
and
i
be
always
amaze
at
how
poorly
they
be
run
there
be
no
marketing
pizzazz
many
of
the
facility
be
rundown
and
in
dire
need
of
a
facelift
and
the
customer
service
be
crummy
to
make
matter
bad
the
industry
have
fail
to
keep
pace
with
advance
in
technology
and
change
customer
preference
it
be
no
wonder
horse
race
be
lose
ground
to
alternate
form
of
game
but
i
thought
it
present
a
powerful
and
potentially
lucrative
untapped
business
opportunity
i
believe
all
of
us
have
what
you
might
call
a
gamble
gene
whether
it
s
play
a
game
of
poker
with
your
buddy
buying
a
scratch
and
win
lottery
ticket
or
take
a
flyer
on
a
penny
stock
that
look
poise
to
shoot
up
in
value
most
people
like
to
place
bet
and
make
wager
whether
it
s
for
the
pursuit
of
financial
gain
for
the
satisfaction
of
pick
a
dark
horse
winner
or
for
the
sheer
excitement
that
come
with
place
a
bet
and
put
some
money
on
the
line
stand
at
a
slot
machine
be
nowhere
near
as
excite
as
bet
on
the
pony
and
the
adrenaline
rush
that
come
with
cheer
your
horse
across
the
finish
line
but
the
casino
and
lottery
and
other
game
business
be
do
a
much
well
job
of
marketing
their
product
with
the
poorly
run
racetrack
the
rot
usually
start
at
the
top
the
track
management
and
director
have
a
ritzy
lounge
with
gourmet
food
expensive
booze
and
cigar
you
name
it
when
you
spoke
to
them
about
the
business
they
thought
everything
be
wonderful
all
wine
and
rose
hardly
any
of
these
race
executive
ever
go
down
to
the
grandstand
to
eat
the
tasteless
burger
and
hot
dog
or
drink
the
overprice
draft
beer
but
why
would
they
care
in
many
region
of
the
country
they
be
the
only
game
in
town
and
enjoy
what
amount
to
a
monopoly
that
s
what
happens
whenever
you
have
a
monopoly
service
deteriorates
the
quality
be
shoddy
and
the
price
be
sky
high
monopoly
be
a
curse
on
society
mec
s
vision
be
to
bundle
together
some
of
the
world
s
best
horse
race
content
and
make
it
available
to
a
global
audience
through
the
internet
and
satellite
tv
but
to
do
that
we
have
to
assemble
a
critical
mass
of
racetrack
from
coast
to
coast
under
the
umbrella
of
a
single
company
by
do
so
we
determine
that
we
could
immediately
achieve
some
economy
of
scale
everything
from
the
cost
of
soft
drink
to
liability
insurance
in
practice
it
didn
t
always
work
out
that
way
the
highly
fragment
regulatory
framework
often
prevent
us
from
standardize
operating
practice
or
business
model
it
be
like
quicksand
the
harder
we
kick
the
more
we
thrash
the
faster
we
sank
the
big
mistake
i
make
with
mec
be
to
underestimate
all
of
the
rule
and
regulation
that
govern
the
sport
and
the
impact
on
our
bottom
line
that
they
would
have
the
hodgepodge
patchwork
of
rule
be
laid
down
nearly
a
century
ago
when
wager
on
horse
be
the
only
form
of
legalize
game
the
excessive
regulation
and
outdated
rule
be
the
main
reason
in
my
mind
the
industry
have
decline
so
much
since
its
heyday
we
be
saddle
with
regulation
that
no
other
industry
have
to
contend
with
include
dictate
how
many
day
of
the
year
we
could
open
our
door
for
business
obviously
government
have
a
role
to
play
in
regulate
all
form
of
bet
in
order
to
protect
the
public
and
uphold
the
integrity
of
the
sport
i
met
with
countless
governor
and
legislator
from
the
state
where
our
track
be
locate
and
i
always
have
the
same
message
give
our
industry
the
opportunity
to
grow
and
compete
accord
to
the
same
free
enterprise
principle
that
govern
other
industry
i
argue
that
racetrack
should
be
treat
like
any
other
business
free
to
establish
their
own
hour
of
operation
and
free
to
give
customer
the
ultimate
say
in
determine
the
success
of
a
business
that
way
the
good
racetrack
operator
will
prosper
and
the
bad
one
will
go
out
of
business
when
government
start
tell
you
when
you
can
open
the
door
of
your
business
you
re
in
trouble
and
we
be
in
trouble
despite
massive
lobbying
effort
both
on
our
own
as
well
as
through
various
industry
association
we
be
largely
unable
to
change
any
of
the
antiquate
regulation
in
the
meantime
the
loss
kept
mount
i
always
saw
mid
mec
s
parent
company
as
a
financial
cushion
or
backstop
that
would
allow
mec
to
sustain
loss
in
the
early
go
until
the
fledgling
racetrack
company
could
get
on
its
foot
financially
regardless
of
what
happen
on
the
race
side
of
the
business
mid
held
all
of
the
land
the
racetrack
sat
on
it
be
rock
solid
collateral
hundred
of
acre
of
prime
undeveloped
real
estate
in
major
urban
market
throughout
the
u
s
but
mid
shareholder
particularly
the
hedge
fund
didn
t
see
it
that
way
and
we
repeatedly
lock
horn
when
mid
and
mec
go
public
the
information
circular
sent
to
prospective
shareholder
clearly
spell
out
that
i
have
the
control
bloc
of
share
in
both
company
shareholder
knew
the
score
but
despite
that
some
shareholder
allege
i
have
act
unfairly
and
launch
legal
action
against
me
the
legal
attack
be
dismiss
but
they
be
an
enormous
drain
on
my
time
and
energy
i
always
have
one
eye
on
the
litigation
instead
of
both
on
run
the
business
our
revenue
climbed
year
after
year
but
we
couldn
t
turn
a
profit
a
lot
of
money
be
lose
even
to
the
very
end
we
kept
pour
cash
in
to
keep
mec
afloat
i
truly
felt
sorry
for
the
people
who
lose
money
i
knew
of
trainer
and
other
people
at
the
racetrack
who
have
invest
or
more
in
the
stock
a
lot
of
money
for
them
they
believe
in
the
business
and
the
money
they
have
sunk
into
mec
be
go
i
also
believe
the
business
could
be
viable
and
i
do
everything
i
could
to
save
mec
but
it
be
not
to
be
in
the
end
i
personally
lose
more
than
any
other
single
investor
about
million
when
mec
be
finally
push
into
chapter
bankruptcy
proceeding
i
have
no
idea
what
fate
lay
in
store
for
the
racetrack
but
once
i
sell
operating
control
of
magna
i
stockpile
enough
cash
to
rescue
the
race
business
otherwise
in
all
likelihood
the
racetrack
would
have
be
piece
off
or
shut
down
and
the
land
they
sat
on
sell
to
developer
i
settle
with
mid
s
disgruntle
shareholder
they
get
control
of
mid
and
be
able
to
turn
it
into
a
pure
real
estate
investment
play
and
i
get
the
beleaguer
race
asset
i
acquire
santa
anita

gulfstream
park
pimlico
laurel
park
golden

and
some
other

related
business
and
property
and
fold
them
into
my
privately
held
company
the
stronach
group
by
the
end
of
we
have
stop
the
bleeding
and
finally
turn
a
corner
in
term
of
the
profitability
of
the
track
with
mec
we
have
simply
run
out
of
money
and
we
have
run
out
of
time
i
still
believe
that
the
business
of
horse
race
have
a
great
future
i
m
free
now
to
do
a
number
of
thing
that
i
couldn
t
do
when
mec
be
control
by
mid
from
the
begin
of
record
history
people
have
always
bet
on
horse
race
and
i
believe
they
always
will
lead
by
example
my
philosophy
have
always
be
that
employee
don
t
work
for
you
they
work
with
you
i
remember
many
time
during
the
early
year
of
my
business
when
we
would
work
late
into
the
night
to
meet
a
deadline
i
would
roll
up
my
sleeve
and
work
on
a
bench
alongside
everyone
else
there
be
no
well
way
to
lead
than
by
example
chapter
the
high
a
monkey
climb
the
world
be
full
of
critic
but
there
be
very
few
people
who
can
offer
solution
i
m
pretty
philosophical
when
it
come
to
all
the
criticism
i
ve
receive
over
the
year
there
s
an
old
caribbean
say
that
go
the
high
a
monkey
climb
up
the
tree
the
more
his
as
be
expose
i
use
to
face
a
lot
of
my
critic
in
person
each
year
at
the
annual
shareholder
meeting
of
the
various
company
that
i
chair
one
of
my
toughest
critic
and
also
big
supporter
be
denise
altman
a
shareholder
of
magna
international
who
come
to
our
annual
meeting
each
and
every
year
well
into
her
eighty
she
never
pull
any
punch
and
if
she
thought
that
we
be
fall
short
or
go
off
course
she
let
us
know
but
she
be
also
the
first
to
stand
up
and
congratulate
us
on
a
job
well
do
some
of
the
criticism
i
ve
receive
over
the
year
be
about
the
pay
i
make
i
use
to
say
that
i
should
get
paid
as
much
as
a
hollywood
actor
since
i
sometimes
have
to
act
on
stage
and
i
should
get
paid
at
least
as
much
as
a
professional
hockey
player
since
i
sometimes
have
to
pas
the
puck
but
the
plain
fact
be
my
pay
be
tie
to
magna
s
profitability
the
more
profit
magna
make
the
more
i
get
paid
i
don
t
know
many
executive
who
would
base
their
compensation
entirely
on
the
performance
of
the
company
in
when
magna
didn
t
make
a
profit
i
earn
a
base
salary
that
be
low
than
the
salary
paid
to
some
of
our
firm
s
junior
lawyer
i
can
guarantee
you
that
no
one
come
rush
forward
to
say
that
stronach
should
get
paid
more
i
once
told
a
shareholder
who
criticize
my
pay
at
an
annual
meeting
that
my
employee
be
not
only
happy
about
how
much
i
make
they
hope
i
make
even
more
the
next
year
because
that
mean
that
they
ll
also
get
more
profit
share
that
s
the
magna
way
the
magna
formula
for
success
there
be
several
hundred
employee
in
the
crowd
and
they
broke
out
into
spontaneous
thunderous
applause
the
key
point
concern
management
compensation
be
that
it
s
primarily
base
on
the
profitability
of
the
company
when
magna
didn
t
make
a
profit
in
executive
management
include
myself
receive
compensation
that
be
far
below
industry
standard
at
many
company
however
management
be
paid
regardless
of
how
the
company
performs
but
if
executive
management
steer
the
company
in
the
right
direction
and
magna
make
high
profit
then
management
investor
and
employee
all
get
a
large
share
of
those
profit
everybody
benefit
without
good
management
a
company
can
t
thrive
and
you
won
t
have
good
management
unless
you
re
able
to
attract
the
best
in
the
industry
by
offering
competitive
wage
and
built
in
performance
incentive
the
top
manager
be
usually
individual
who
be
capable
of
run
their
own
business
if
they
could
make
more
by
run
their
own
business
there
would
be
no
incentive
for
them
to
stay
at
magna
so
we
need
to
make
sure
that
we
have
the
best
people
available
and
we
do
this
by
provide
incentive
i
look
at
some
of
the
high
paid
executive
in
north
america
the
hedge
fund
manager
and
investment
banker
and
many
of
them
didn
t
create
a
single
job
it
use
to
be
that
the
more
job
you
create
the
more
sale
and
profit
you
generate
the
more
money
you
make
but
that
doesn
t
seem
to
be
true
anymore
in
today
s
business
world
it
seem
that
the
more
people
you
lay
off
the
more
plant
you
close
and
job
you
kill
the
more
money
you
make
and
i
think
we
ve
get
it
backwards
the
business
leader
or
executive
we
should
really
reward
be
the
one
who
create
job
and
produce
a
profit
over
the
last
few
year
magna
absorbed
a
lot
of
criticism
from
pension
fund
and
investment
firm
that
our
corporate
governance
practice
be
below
standard
some
of
the
most
vocal
critic
have
be
the
large
institutional
investor
which
tend
to
be
concerned
primarily
with
short
term
profit
lately
a
lot
of
these
institutional
investor
want
to
go
beyond
mere
invest
they
want
to
also
have
a
major
say
in
how
the
company
be
run
they
re
great
at
pump
up
a
stock
s
value
then
flip
it
or
strip
out
the
most
valuable
asset
of
a
company
and
sell
them
for
short
term
gain
even
if
it
damage
the
long
term
viability
of
the
business
and
if
lay
off
employee
can
boost
short
term
profitability
even
if
the
company
be
do
well
they
ll
do
it
at
a
shareholder
meeting
a
few
year
ago
a
representative
from
one
of
those
large
institutional
investor
stood
up
and
read
a
long
criticism
of
magna
s
dual
class
structure
something
they
be
fully
aware
of
when
they
purchase
our
stock
i
believe
the
investment
firm
have
do
quite
well
since
magna
have
just
post
record
profit
and
sale
and
the
stock
be
up
year
over
year
so
i
told
the
institutional
investor
you
know
you
guy
remind
me
of
the
couple
that
buy
a
house
next
to
the
airport
and
then
constantly
complains
about
the
noise

many
of

on
the

and
although
the

preaches
about

it
curiously

not

loud
about

we
ran
the

be
free
to

elsewhere
that
s
not
the
case
for
the
ten
of
thousand
of
ontario
teacher
who
be
counting
on

i
ve
take
potshot
from
many
different
group
everyone
from
organize
labour
and
wall
street
investor
to
politician
and
reporter
and
during
that
time
i
ve
be
the
subject
of
a
lot
of
medium
coverage
most
of
the
reporting
be
fair
and
balance
which
be
all
that
anyone
can
ask
for
but
some
of
it
be
shoddy
and
downright
malicious
most
reporter
mean
well
they
strive
to
perform
their
job
to
the
best
of
their
ability
they
want
to
accurately
reflect
what
you
re
say
and
report
the
news
as
objectively
as
possible
some
reporter
though
harbour
a
strong
personal
bias
either
against
a
certain
individual
or
against
business
in
general
and
these
reporter
will
sometimes
distort
information
or
leave
out
key
fact
in
order
to
paint
a
negative
picture
of
a
company
or
particular
person
i
should
state
upfront
that
i
believe
the
medium
be
one
of
the
main
pillar
of
our
society
it
play
a
vital
role
in
inform
citizen
and
serve
as
a
check
and
balance
on
the
activity
of
business
and
government
it
can
also
have
an
enormous
influence
on
reform
government
and
on
educate
citizen
about
important
socio
economic
issue
or
make
them
aware
of
problem
that
need
to
be
address
in
short
the
medium
can
be
a
positive
force
within
our
society
i
furthermore
believe
that
a
free
press
be
a
cornerstone
of
a
free
and
democratic
society
but
that
freedom
shouldn
t
be
a
licence
to
publish
inaccurate
statement
or
falsehood
without
any
responsibility
for
the
repercussion
or
consequence
a
poison
pen
can
do
more
damage
than
bullet
if
the
medium
doesn
t
do
its
homework
if
it
get
the
fact
wrong
in
a
way
that
damage
personal
or
corporate
reputation
then
it
should
be
held
liable
put
it
this
way
if
magna
ever
make
a
faulty
brake
pedal
and
someone
get
injured
as
result
magna
would
be
penalize
by
the
court
and
sue
for
damage
but
when
medium
outlet
damage
reputation
because
of
false
reporting
there
be
hardly
ever
any
serious
financial
penalty
impose
the
medium
believe
that
one
of
its
chief
role
be
to
hold
business
government
academia
and
others
to

through

scrutiny
and
the
constant
monitoring
and
reporting
of
their

but
who

on
the
reporter
who
be
hold
the
medium
to
account
in
the
final
analysis
the
same
tough
standard
the
medium
us
to
hold
others
to
account
must
also
apply
to
the
medium
itself
at
this
point
in
my
life
i
need
more
criticism
like
i
need
a
hole
in
the
head
if
i
want
to
i
could
sit
back
rest
on
my
laurel
keep
quiet
and
i
would
be
in
everyone
s
good
book
but
that
would
be
take
the
easy
way
out
i
m
financially
independent
and
not
beholden
to
any
individual
or
group
i
don
t
need
government
handout
and
i
don
t
have
to
cater
to
any
politician
i
ve
always
do
what
i
thought
be
right
and
what
i
felt
be
in
the
best
interest
of
my
company
and
its
stakeholder
or
the
country
and
its
citizen
and
if
i
really
believe
in
a
certain
cause
or
issue
if
i
think
something
isn
t
right
or
fair
or
if
i
think
we
re
head
in
the
wrong
direction
then
you
can
be
sure
that
i
ll
speak
out
take
pride
in
do
something
well
my
trade
apprenticeship
taught
me
to
take
pride
in
everything
i
do
no
matter
how
small
the
job
if
you
don
t
posse
the
pride
to
do
something
well
and
if
that
pride
isn
t
deeply
engrained
in
you
then
you
re
doom
to
mediocrity
in
whatever
you
do
whether
it
s
your
career
or
your
business
chapter
make
the
wheel
a
little
rounder
if
thing
don
t
function
properly
be
it
in
your
personal
life
in
your
business
or
in
your
country
you
should
know
that
you
ve
get
a
problem
if
you
don
t
know
that
you
ve
get
a
problem
then
you
ve
really
get
a
problem
and
problem
be
like
cancer
if
left
unattended
they
will
grow
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
make
a
well
product
for
a
well
price
isn
t
just
a
formula
for
make
car
part
i
ve
always
believe
that
we
should
apply
that
think
to
every
facet
of
society
especially
those
area
that
have
the
great
bearing
on
our
quality
of
life
the
economy
education
and
health
care
the
truth
be
the
world
be
full
of
critic
but
there
be
very
few
people
who
come
forward
with
constructive
solution
and
then
submit
those
solution
to
public
scrutiny
over
the
year
i
ve
try
to
do
that
and
i
ve
encourage
others
to
do
so
as
well
there
s
nothing
fancy
about
a
lot
of
the
idea
that
i
ve
put
forward
i
think
they
re
fairly
logical
and
base
on
fairness
and
common
sense
most
importantly
i
think
they
re
idea
that
could
benefit
everyone
in
society
not
just
a
select
few
competition
in
its
purest
form
be
what
sport
be
all
about
i
love
competition
because
it
sharpens
your
mind
your
sens
your
body
whenever
i
play
tennis
i
always
want
to
square
off
against
well
player
because
i
end
up
improve
my
own
skill
and
my
own
game
we
need
to
do
more
to
develop
what
i
call
a
sport
character
in
student
school
ought
to
devote
more
time
to
sport
activity
and
other
athletic
endeavour
this
will
require
building
more
facility
to
give
youth
the
venue
they
need
to
play
and
practise
these
various
sport
but
the
long
term
social
and
economic
benefit
would
far
outweigh
the
initial
cost
through
an
enhance
focus
on
sport
we
would
expose
young
people
to
the
joy
and
rigour
of
competition
and
this
in
turn
would
help
them
develop
many
desirable
social
quality
such
as
leadership
determination
teamwork
persistence
and
the
harness
of
individual
talent
in
the
pursuit
of
a
common
goal
the
idea
of
make
physical
activity
and
athletic
competition
a
key
feature
in
the
education
of
our
youth
be
not
a
new
one
it
go
back
to
the
classical
civilization
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
but
it
seem
as
if
we
have
recently
lose
sight
of
the
tremendous
virtue
that
come
with
have
a
strong
athletic
component
in
our
educational
system
we
need
to
return
to
those
root
and
begin
reap
once
again
the
many
benefit
that
come
through
athletics
and
competitive
sport
in
other
word
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
the
many
non
academic
aspect
of
education
that
help
develop
well
adjust
citizen
who
will
contribute
to
our
social
and
economic
well
be
later
in
life
i
call
this
approach
lifestyle
education
the
teach
of
basic
principle
that
will
enable
young
people
to
lead
healthy
balance
and
productive
life
within
the
school
themselves
we
need
to
place
a
much
heavier
emphasis
on
physical
fitness
and
nutrition
particularly
in
the
young
grade
physical
fitness
and
nutrition
go
hand
in
hand
they
be
the
building
block
in
the
development
of
healthy
young
adult
every
child
should
have
at
least
one
nutritious
meal
at
the
school
cafeteria
or
lunchroom
and
the
education
system
should
instill
an
understand
of
nutrition
at
an
early
age
student
also
need
to
acquire
a
great
awareness
of
how
important
the
economy
be
to
the
overall
function
of
our
society
and
we
need
to
place
a
much
great
emphasis
in
our
school
system
on
the
creation
of
wealth
the
underpin
of
our
living
standard
i
believe
there
s
an
anti
business
bias
in
some
quarter
of
our
educational
system
for
some
teacher
and
educator
business
be
a
dirty
word
and
they
hold
the
view
that
if
a
business
do
well
it
must
be
because
the
company
be
take
advantage
of
people
or
engage
in
unethical
practice
for
others
there
be
plenty
of
real
world
example
to
point
to
company
that
treat
employee
unfairly
or
break
the
law
or
harm
the
environment
when
that
happens
it
s
not
surprising
that
some
people
develop
an
anti
business
disposition
and
there
be
many
teacher
who
absorb
negative
stereotype
through
the
medium
and
movie
these
negative
stereotype
sometimes
dissuade
young
people
from
think
about
career
in
business
especially
as
entrepreneur
but
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
student
need
to
gain
a
great
understand
of
the
importance
of
business
if
the
economy
doesn
t
function
nothing
else
will
function
either
our
health
care
our
education
our
art
and
entertainment
our
social
welfare
system
they
all
feed
off
the
wealth
that
business
creates
we
also
need
to
promote
technical
education
much
more
than
we
currently
do
a
college
or
university
education
be
not
for
everyone
from
age
to
our
student
should
be
expose
to
a
wide
range
of
trade
everything
from
carpentry
and
electronics
to
computer
repair
and
automotive
mechanic
when
you
look
at
the
strong
economy
in
the
world
germany
be
always
front
and
centre
and
one
of
the
reason
germany
be
such
a
robust
exporter
of
world
class
product
be
that
it
place
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
engineering
on
make
product
and
it
can
do
this
because
of
the
country
s
outstanding
trade
and
technical
skill
training
in
i
receive
an
honorary
phd
in
business
administration
from
laurentian
university
i
be
greet
at
the
convocation
ceremony
by
jean
chr
tien
the
former
prime
minister
who
teasingly
call
me
dr
stronach
sit
on
the
stage
wait
to
receive
my
honorary
degree
i
look
out
at
the
hundred
of
young
university
graduate
in
their
cap
and
gown
fill
with
hope
and
optimism
and
i
couldn
t
help
but
feel
sorry
for
them
give
the
state
of
the
economy
and
their
future
prospect
many
no
doubt
incur
a
lot
of
debt
to
pay
for
their
education
and
many
obtain
liberal
art
degree
that
will
be
of
little
practical
value
and
in
many
case
will
not
lead
to
a
productive
career
in
short
they
want
to
contribute
to
society
but
i
feel
we
ve
let
them
down
by
not
give
them
the
right
tool
by
not
provide
the
best
path
to
reward
and
successful
career
lastly
i
feel
that
we
need
to
do
more
in
regard
to
teach
our
young
people
how
to
become
economically
free
most
people
desire
personal
freedom
the
right
to
choose
their
own
road
to
happiness
combine
with
economic
freedom
what
might
also
be
call
financial
independence
it
astonishes
me
that
we
don
t
do
more
as
a
society
to
encourage
economic
freedom
among
individual
or
encourage
business
to
promote
profit
and
equity
participation
so
that
worker
can
become
part
owner
in
their
place
of
employment
and
share
in
the
company
s
financial
success
by
reform
our
educational
system
to
incorporate
some
of
these
idea
we
could
help
create
well
citizen
with
the
skill
need
to
prosper
in
the
new
global
economy
it
s
our
duty
to
give
student
the
tool
they
need
to
create
and
compete
and
to
open
them
up
to
the
limitless
possibility
that
lie
within
their
reach
if
we
can
do
that
then
we
will
have
a
much
great
chance
of
ensure
our
future
prosperity
we
need
to
undertake
similar
reform
in
the
field
of
health
care
to
begin
with
i
believe
that
in
a
civilize
society
every
person
must
have
access
to
basic
health
care
i
see
no
reason
why
a
public
system
and
private
system
could
not
co
exist
but
private
health
care
provider
should
be
require
to
make
between
to
percent
of
their
billing
available
at
government
prescribed
public
rate
this
would
relieve
the
enormous
strain
on
financial
and
human
resource
under
a
system
of
government
provide
health
care
while
opening
the
field
up
to
a
great
number
of
health
care
provider
the
key
feature
of
any
system
be
competition
and
incentive
without
competition
and
without
incentive
that
reward
the
best
and
most
efficient
any
health
care
system
be
destine
to
slide
into
mediocrity
cost
begin
to
spiral
high
while
quality
deteriorates
i
ve
also
be
a
long
time
advocate
of
push
medical
care
into
the
workplace
as
a
way
to
deliver
well
health
care
service
at
a
low
cost
by
bring
health
care
worker
directly
into
the
workplace
to
improve
health
care
access
and
service
for
employee
and
their
family
we
could
reduce
the
health
care
cost
paid
by
employer
individual
and
the
government
in
the
early
s
in
the
midst
of
a
severe
economic
downturn
i
propose
this
concept
to
the
ontario
government
under
my
proposal
corporate
manage
health
care
service
would
be
make
available
to
magna
s
employee
in
that
province
and
to
their
immediate
family
member
spouse
child
parent
and
grandparent
and
would
be
carry
out
with
the
consent
of
employee
who
would
remain
free
to
seek
medical
care
elsewhere
if
they
wish
employee
would
be
require
to
take
part
in
paid
preventive
health
education
in
the
workplace
and
employee
would
also
be
involve
in
oversee
the
management
of
the
program
through
the
appointment
of
advisory
board
member
this
new
health
care
model
would
have
take
an
enormous
strain
off
the
clinic
and
hospital
in
the
region
where
most
of
magna
s
employee
live
and
work
and
we
threw
in
a
classic
fair
enterprise
twist
we
propose
that
all
of
the
stakeholder
get
a
cut
of
the
saving
associate
with
health
care
efficiency
employee
would
share
a
chunk
of
the
saving
in
the
form
of
a
cash
rebate
while
the
company
would
divvy
up
almost
half
of
the
saving
a
portion
would
go
to
the
doctor
and
medical
staff
in
the
form
of
an
efficiency
bonus
to
reward
the
more
efficient
delivery
of
health
care
service
and
about
percent
would
go
into
a
medical
emergency
account
a
sort
of
rainy
day
fund
through
the
new
corporate
model
for
health
care
delivery
that
i
propose
i
believe
we
could
have
slash
cost
by
up
to
percent
while
improve
service
in
every
health
care
catchment
area
of
a
certain
size
approximately
employee
and
their
family
member
magna
would
have
built
a
state
of
the
art
medical
diagnostic
centre
with
x
ray
and
laboratory
facility
and
equipment
such
as
ultrasound
diagnostic
image
and
mri
scanner
the
cost
associate
with
the
purchase
and
maintenance
of
this
medical
equipment
would
have
be
cover
entirely
by
magna
we
would
have
also
establish
a
program
of
preventive
health
care
that
would
involve
a
minimum
of
ten

it
s
what
i
call
the

so
how
do
we
take
the

out
of

by
introduce
a

government
you
might
end
up
with
a
bureaucrat
who
d
say
the
pay
s
great
but
i
hate
spending
time
with
the
little
bugger
in
addition
to
volunteer
as
a
big
brother
i
ve
serve
as
a
volunteer
board
member
over
the
year
for
numerous
charitable
educational
and
philanthropic
cause
include
the
board
of
hospital
and
university
these
experience
have
give
me
valuable
insight
into
the
many
need
and
issue
that
exist
in
society
not
only
do
business
have
a
responsibility
to
support
the
social
fabric
but
so
too
do
individual
citizen
especially
those
among
us
who
be
more
fortunate
and
who
have
the
mean
and
opportunity
to
give
back
to
society
and
at
magna
give
back
to
society
isn
t
about
charity
it
s
about
share
profit
with
one
of
our
key
stakeholder
society
that
s
one
reason
why
magna
establish
a
technical
training
centre
a
number
of
year
ago
in
park
height
a
crumble
inner
city
neighbourhood
in
baltimore
maryland
plague
by
high
unemployment
one
of
our
racetrack
pimlico
home
of
the
famous
preakness
stake
race
sat
right
next
to
park
height
one
day
i
say
i
want
to
meet
some
of
the
community
leader
to
see
if
there
be
anything
we
could
do
to
help
the
community
they
be
a
little
skeptical
at
first
no
outsider
no
politician
no
business
person
no
philanthropist
have
ever
show
an
interest
in
the
neighbourhood
so
we
get
in
the
car
and
drove
up
and
down
the
street
the
place
look
like
a
war
zone
home
with
shatter
window
graffiti
and
garbage
board
up
building
one
building
in
particular
caught
my
attention
an
abandon
elementary
school
i
inquire
into
whether
or
not
we
could
get
the
school
my
plan
turn
it
into
one
of
the
most
modern
technical
training
centre
in
the
country
but
i
need
someone
to
run
the
facility
so
i
checked
into
whether
magna
have
any
manager
with
a
strong
technical
background
someone
who
would
be
a
good
person
to
take
young
teen
from
the
park
height
neighbourhood
and
turn
them
into
toolmaker
a
couple
of
our
operation
people
suggest
paul
myles
an
up
and
come
magna
manager
work
in
the
detroit
area
i
call
paul
and
ask
him
to
come
up
and
see
me
i
say
i
have
an
intrigue
proposition
we
chat
for
a
bit
about
business
at
his
factory
and
then
i
told
him
about
our
plan
for
a
technical
training
centre
would
you
be
interested
in
run
it
i
ask
would
i
ever
he
say
incredibly
as
fate
would
have
it
paul
myles
grow
up
in
park
height
a
stone
s
throw
from
the
location
of
the
training
facility
the
idea
of
return
to
his
root
and
give
kid
in
the
neighbourhood
the
same
shot
in
life
that
he
have
meant
the
world
to
him
so
in
january
with
paul
myles
at
the
helm
the
magna
baltimore
technical
training
center
open
its
door
to
young
african
american
men
and
woman
living
in
the
area
it
be
state
of
the
art
complete
with
the
most
technologically
advanced
equipment
as
well
as
a
gymnasium
and
community
activity
centre
i
want
to
give
the
kid
in
the
area
hope
a
ticket
to
a
well
life
at
the
official
opening
ceremony
a
number
of
the
neighbourhood
resident
have
tear
in
their
eye
we
believe
some
of
the
future
graduate
will
one
day
work
for
magna
and
perhaps
become
manager
to
be
a
magna
manager
you
ve
get
to
grasp
the
production
process
inside
out
otherwise
you
cannot
lead
the
men
and
woman
who
work
on
the
factory
floor
the
training
program
we
launch
in
baltimore
have
already
change
life
turn
homeless
youth
living
on
the
street
into
skilled
tradesman
earn
a
good
middle
class
wage
we
do
something
similar
nearly
twenty
year
earlier
building
a
magna
factory
in
a
remote
economically
depressed
area
it
be
probably
consider
the
last
place
on
earth
that
magna
would
ever
build
an
auto
part
factory
in
the
late
s
we
announce
plan
to
open
a
manufacturing
facility
in
cape
breton
a
harsh
rocky
region
of
canada
that
jut
out
into
the
atlantic
ocean
cape
breton
be
traditionally
a
coal
mining
region
and
most
of
the
men
who
work
near
sydney
the
large
town
in
the
area
be
coal
miner
but
the
industry
fell
on
hard
time
a
lot
of
the
mine
close
and
the
unemployment
rate
in
the
region
be
among
the
high
in
the
country
the
canadian
government
have
promise
local
resident
that
it
would
bring
new
industry
to
the
region
and
approach
magna
about
building
a
factory
there
i
be
intrigue
because
i
believe
in
the
notion
that
if
you
have
the
right
business
philosophy
and
the
right
operating
principle
you
could
go
into
an
economically
depressed
area
and
create
a
profitable
business
it
be
for
me
an
acid
test
for
magna
s
fair
enterprise
philosophy
geographically
it
didn
t
make
any
sense
cape
breton
be
thousand
of
mile
from
our
closest
customer
but
there
be
another
factor
to
consider
one
that
wasn
t
base
purely
on
hard
business
cost
it
be
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
could
make
a
contribution
to
society
by
create
manufacturing
job
in
a
remote
region
of
the
country
i
visit
the
area
and
immediately
take
a
like
to
the
cape
bretoners
they
be
salt
of
the
earth
people
friendly
good
natured
and
industrious
their
family
have
be
there
for
generation
and
i
thought
they
have
won
through
sheer
toil
and
perseverance
the
right
to
be
give
another
chance
while
the
community
be
elate
about
the
news
that
magna
would
open
a
factory
some
of
our
shareholder
be
less
enthusiastic
it
be
a
seedling
and
we
left
it
to
the
people
in
that
community
to
nurture
that
seedling
with
our
help
and
oversight
the
facility
be
around
square
foot
and
have
all
of
the
most
modern
equipment
we
even
start
a
small
program
to
train
tool
and
die
maker
right
in
the
plant
many
of
the
employee
be
the
son
and
daughter
of
coal
miner
the
plant
struggle
in
the
early
year
we
try
to
zero
in
on
the
right
product
and
decide
to
manufacture
small
transmission
component
part
that
could
more
easily
be
ship
long
distance
and
eventually
despite
the
prediction
of
many
skeptic
the
plant
begin
to
turn
a
profit
in
the
early
s
but
the
cape
breton
facility
under
pressure
from
cheaper
supplier
in
asia
pacific
saw
profit
sink
when
the
economic
crisis
hit
and
the
auto
industry
ground
to
a
halt
business
all
but
dry
up
the
facility
provide
meaningful
work
for
many
people
for
many
year
we
give
a
lot
of
young
people
a
good
ground
in
technical
skill
and
train
a
number
of
toolmaker
people
who
gain
the
know
how
to
create
product
and
open
their
own
small
tool
shop
the
cape
breton
plant
prove
that
with
the
right
business
approach
and
with
hard
work
people
willing
to
make
the
enterprise
a
success
a
business
could
make
a
go
of
it
even
in
a
part
of
the
world
that
most
people
have
write
off
cape
breton
and
park
height
be
world
apart
but
they
share
one
thing
in
common
it
s
easy
to
count
people
out
when
they
ve
be
knock
down
but
it
s
amaze
what
they
will
do
when
someone
give
them
a
hand
up
and
a
second
chance
whether
in
business
or
in
society
or
in
your
own
personal
life
if
something
doesn
t
function
properly
you
should
know
that
you
ve
get
a
problem
and
if
you
don
t
know
that
you
ve
get
a
problem
then
you
ve
really
get
a
problem
problem
be
like
cancer
they
don
t
go
away
by
themselves
they
have
to
be
identify
and
treat
or
they
will
grow
and
the
first
step
in
identify
and
treat
them
be
speak
out
one
of
the
great
danger
we
need
to
be
on
guard
against
be
citizen
especially
young
people
who
become
pacify
to
the
point
where
no
one
any
longer
care
about
try
to
improve
society
because
everyone
considers
that
to
be
the
responsibility
solely
of
the
state
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
to
stop
sweep
problem
under
the
carpet
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
to
stand
up
and
speak
out
that
sentiment
the
desire
of
regular
citizen
to
fix
what
be
wrong
with
the
country
be
what
inspire
me
more
than
fifteen
year
ago
to
create
a
competition
that
ask
college
and
university
student
to
come
up
with
solution
for
make
their
country
more
prosperous
it
be
call
the
canada
s
next
great
prime
minister
program
its
mandate
to
inspire
young
canadian
to
become
involve
in
shape
the
future
of
their
country
and
to
give
them
a
national
platform
to
share
their
idea
for
building
a
well
strong
and
more
prosperous
canada
we
be
tap
into
the
idea
of
ordinary
citizen
the
sort
of
discussion
and
debate
you
d
hear
in
a
corner
coffee
shop
or
bar
with
people
say
if
i
be
run
the
country
i
d
and
then
they
proceed
to
passionately
tell
you
what
they
would
do
to
make
the
country
well
the
competition
eventually
evolve
into
a
national
tv
show
complete
with
a
panel
of
judge
compose
of
former
prime
minister
and
a
live
studio
audience
that
vote
for
the
contestant
of
their
choice
to
become
canada
s
next
great
prime
minister
we
end
up
licensing
the
tv
show
concept
to
a
number
of
country
around
the
world
include
germany
with
ongoing
interest
from
many
others
over
the
year
the
annual
contestant
have
admirably
address
the
problem
face
their
country
with
creativity
courage
and
conviction
a
number
have
since
go
on
to
become
elect
politician
in
seek
a
new
vision
for
the
future
it
s
only
natural
that
we
turn
to
young
people
after
all
no
one
have
more
at
stake
in
the
future
than
they
do
the
issue
these
student
address
such
as
reform
the
political
system
and
ignite
economic
growth
be
issue
that
will
ultimately
have
a
bearing
on
the
country
s
standard
of
living
and
who
know
perhaps
a
future
president
or
prime
minister
will
have
gotten
their
start
as
a
contestant
in
this
unique
program
what
really
fire
me
up
to
become
a
donor
or
volunteer
be
that
it
would
eat
away
at
my
conscience
to
know
that
someone
need
help
and
i
do
nothing
about
it
it
s
like
the
story
of
the
teacher
who
take
his
student
on
a
field
trip
out
into
the
country
they
hear
the
distant
whine
and
yelp
of
a
dog
at
first
the
teacher
ignores
the
cry
but
after
a
while
he
follow
the
barking
until
he
discovers
a
dog
tremble
and
exhaust
entangle
in
a
leash
tie
to
a
tree
he
unties
the
dog
and
one
of
the
student
congratulates
him
on
his
good
deed
say
he
be
a
kind
man
the
teacher
reply
that
his
conscience
would
have
bother
him
and
he
wouldn
t
have
be
able
to
sleep
at
night
have
he
ignore
the
dog
s
cry
for
help
any
longer
and
so
it
be
in
life
certain
experience
become
embed
in
your
soul
forever
stuck
in
your
mind
if
i
could
enrich
someone
s
life
make
it
well
in
even
the
small
way
or
if
through
my
action
or
the
knowledge
i
ve
accumulate
i
could
bring
happiness
to
someone
less
fortunate
then
i
feel
compel
to
do
so
but
just
give
money
alone
isn
t
the
answer
just
as
important
perhaps
even
most
important
be
what
we
can
donate
in
term
of
our
time
and
talent
the
beauty
of
the
profit
share
formula
i
create
at
magna
be
that
a
cut
of
the
profit
go
to
society
two
percent
may
sound
minuscule
but
when
profit
approach
the
billion
mark
percent
be
million
money
that
get
invest
into
hospital
to
buy
advanced
equipment
for
diagnose
and
treat
cancer
and
heart
disease
it
s
money
that
be
donate
to
local
soccer
and
hockey
team
to
buy
jersey
and
scoreboard
and
pay
for
ice
time
and
referee
and
it
s
money
that
support
senior
citizen
hospice
for
the
die
rehabilitation
program
for
wayward
youth
and
virtually
every
sort
of
charity
and
volunteer
agency
that
help
individual
and
family
in
need
that
s
the
great
thing
about
have
a
successful
company
you
can
share
that
success
with
society
by
improve
the
life
of
others
there
s
not
a
day
go
by
that
i
don
t
think
i
be
truly
bless
life
s
be
great
to
me
i
ve
have
no
real
setback
no
major
sickness
no
handicap
i
ve
get
everything
a
man
could
want
with
all
of
the
resource
at
my
disposal
i
simply
can
t
in
all
good
conscience
sit
passively
by
when
i
have
a
chance
to
make
thing
well
i
look
at
my
grandson
and
my
granddaughter
and
all
of
our
future
generation
and
i
think
what
kind
of
world
do
i
want
to
leave
behind
what
contribution
can
i
make
so
that
we
can
have
less
poverty
and
a
well
society
i
ve
get
to
do
what
i
can
to
change
the
system
for
the
well
give
back
i
believe
that
all
of
us
should
every
now
and
then
reflect
on
how
we
might
be
able
to
serve
society
for
instance
i
always
tell
student
to
remember
that
they
re
fortunate
to
have
be
give
the
opportunity
to
study
and
that
while
they
have
a
right
to
use
that
knowledge
and
training
for
their
own
personal
benefit
they
should
never
forget
that
some
of
the
knowledge
they
ve
accumulate
should
also
benefit
society
chapter
the
harder
you
work
the
luckier
you
get
some
people
have
to
clean
the
sewer
but
as
a
society
we
must
ensure
that
we
never
screw
the
sewer
cover
on
so
tightly
that
someone
can
t
climb
out
and
perhaps
one
day
hold
the
high
office
in
the
land
overall
i
consider
myself
a
pretty
lucky
guy
luck
can
play
a
role
in
many
aspect
of
our
life
but
at
the
same
time
i
ve
always
believe
that
you
have
to
try
to
influence
the
amount
of
luck
that
come
your
way
it
s
like
the
old
say
you
ve
get
to
be
good
to
be
lucky
and
at
the
same
time
i
also
truly
believe
that
opportunity
often
come
call
you
just
have
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
it
next
to
my
canadian
home
be
the
barn
where
a
number
of
my
thoroughbred
racehorse
be
stable
in
the
spring
and
summer
after
visit
the
barn
in
the
morning
i
usually
walk
through
the
grass
on
the
way
back
to
my
house
the
grass
have
large
patch
and
clump
of
clover
throughout
which
the
horse
love
to
eat
and
often
when
i
walk
through
the
grass
i
stop
to
see
if
i
can
find
a
four
leaf
clover
accord
to
popular
tradition
the
leaf
bring
good
luck
to
their
finder
i
ve
even
heard
it
say
that
there
be
three
leaf
clover
for
every
one
four
leaf
clover
maybe
i
m
more
superstitious
than
i
d
care
to
admit
or
maybe
i
just
enjoy
the
challenge
but
you
ll
often
find
me
at
that
time
of
the
day
bent
down
sweep
my
hand
through
the
grass
try
to
spot
that
classic
symbol
of
good
fortune
most
day
i
come
up
with
a
four
leaf
clover
sometimes
a
whole
bunch
i
pick
them
out
of
the
patch
and
scoop
them
up
left
and
right
bam
bam
bam
and
people
who
be
with
me
usually
say
how
can
you
do
that
i
can
t
see
any
but
to
me
they
jump
out
it
s
as
if
they
re
red
it
s
not
unlike
when
you
immerse
yourself
in
something
you
start
filter
out
the
noise
that
you
don
t
want
to
hear
the
object
you
don
t
want
to
see
you
start
zero
in
and
you
get
so
close
you
can
practically
see
the
skeleton
whenever
i
have
a
bad
experience
i
try
to
take
away
a
lesson
so
i
don
t
make
the
same
mistake
again
but
i
never
look
back
in
anger
i
don
t
get
upset
or
hold
grudge
because
that
generates
negative
energy
it
s
also
a
question
of
be
pragmatic
what
s
the
point
in
get
mad
what
be
you
go
to
solve
i
always
look
ahead
and
stay
positive
i
m
happy
with
whatever
i
have
whatever
hand
i
get
dealt
i
simply
make
the
best
of
it
and
i
always
try
to
see
if
i
can
take
something
and
make
it
a
little
well
i
m
no
different
from
most
people
when
thing
be
go
smoothly
when
the
sun
be
shin
i
lay
off
the
pedal
a
bit
slow
down
become
more
playful
but
when
thing
be
tough
i
knuckle
under
i
shut
out
all
of
the
diversion
and
i
really
believe
that
from
time
to
time
a
storm
can
be
healthy
it
test
you
it
weed
out
weakness
and
blow
off
the
rotten
branch
as
long
as
it
doesn
t
sink
the
ship
a
storm
can
be
a
good
thing
i
m
a
true
believer
that
in
business
and
in
life
opportunity
and
good
future
often
come
disguise
as
hard
work
one
of
my
favourite
canadian
writer
be
the
humorist
stephen
leacock
what
i
admire
most
about
leacock
be
the
way
that
he
could
weave
certain
timeless
truth
into
a
witty
phrase
or
funny
story
one
of
my
favourite
line
from
leacock
s
write
go
something
like
this
i
m
a
great
believer
in
luck
the
harder
i
work
the
more
luck
i
have
leacock
s
famous
quotation
reminds
me
of
a
newspaper
ad
i
once
saw
describe
a
lose
dog
the
ad
say
miss
a
black
labrador
with
a
cripple
leg
be
run
over
by
a
truck
big
scar
on
its
back
be
shot
by
a
hunter
get
on
in
age
and
halfblind
answer
to
the
name
of
lucky
sometimes
lately
i
feel
like
that
old
labrador
other
time
i
feel
like
the
maple
tree
that
stand
in
a
field
near
the
magna
head
office
property
in
aurora
i
ve
be
told
the
tree
base
on
the
size
of
the
trunk
be
probably
more
than
year
old
sometime
during
the
s
the
tree
get
hit
by
lightning
the
lightning
strike
split
the
trunk
in
half
and
shear
off
most
of
the
tree
but
a
large
limb
grow
close
to
the
ground
survive
and
have
continued
to
grow
a
while
back
a
local
artist
ask
for
permission
to
come
on
the
property
and
paint
the
extraordinary
tree
the
artist
create
a
number
of
watercolour
print
of
the
maple
in
fall
summer
spring
and
winter
and
title
the
series
endurance
when
construction
be
take
place
on
the
property
a
number
of
year
ago
i
have
a
chain
link
fence
put
up
around
the
tree
in
case
one
of
the
worker
on
a
bulldozer
ripped
it
out
by
its
root
mistake
it
for
deadwood
i
figure
if
the
tree
have
make
it
this
far
the
least
i
could
do
be
give
it
a
fight
chance
about
three
year
ago
we
be
told
by
an
arborist
that
the
tree
would
most
likely
not
survive
the
winter
the
core
of
the
trunk
be
rotten
and
riddle
with
ant
but
in
spring
incredibly
the
tree
put
out
leaf
once
again
the
decay
trunk
be
splitting
apart
cause
the
last
survive
limb
to
fall
toward
the
ground
so
we
propped
up
the
big
branch
with
a
handmade
wooden
truss
we
then
take
seedling
around
forty
or
fifty
and
we
plant
them
all
over
my
property
i
drive
by
the
tree
quite
often
on
my
way
to
the
office
and
i
confess
to
have
a
soft
spot
for
that
old
maple
you
ve
get
to
admire
its
tenacity
it
s
be
through
a
lot
and
see
a
lot
and
it
have
the
scar
to
prove
it
and
just
when
you
be
ready
to
count
it
out
just
when
you
think
it
s
have
about
all
it
can
take
it
fight
on
still
full
of
life
i
would
like
to
think
that
tree
and
i
share
something
in
common
i
often
say
that
when
you
re
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
with
the
right
sort
of
ingredient
a
lot
of
great
thing
can
happen
and
by
ingredient
i
mean
the
experience
that
you
accumulate
in
life
when
you
ve
experienced
hunger
or
deprivation
or
persecution
you
re
well
able
to
sympathize
with
someone
who
have
suffer
when
i
look
back
now
and
analyze
my
life
i
can
see
clearly
that
my
early
experience
grow
up
in
austria
during
the
depression
and
world
war
ii
contribute
greatly
to
my
success
later
in
life
in
the
final
analysis
i
believe
these
experience
give
me
the
ability
to
recognize
and
seize
opportunity
that
come
along
and
they
taught
me
important
lesson
that
i
could
apply
to
my
career
first
as
an
entrepreneur
building
my
own
business
and
later
as
the
ceo
of
a
multinational
corporation
with
employee
and
customer
throughout
the
world
but
the
ingredient
the
experience
i
gain
along
the
way
be
the
intangible
quality
that
help
me
to
succeed
whenever
opportunity
present
themselves
in
other
word
it
s
not
enough
to
be
at
the
right
place
and
the
right
time
you
must
also
have
the
right
ingredient
like
most
thing
in
life
luck
play
a
role
so
too
do
our
education
our
upbringing
our
skill
and
talent
but
what
often
make
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
be
the
experience
we
bring
to
bear
on
the
challenge
and
opportunity
that
present
themselves
i
often
get
ask
to
state
in
a
few
word
or
a
short
sentence
how
i
would
like
to
be
remember
long
after
i
m
go
and
i
usually
answer
he
kept
his
word
he
be
fair
and
most
of
all
he
make
a
contribution
to
build
a
well
society
magna
the
name
of
the
company
i
built
from
scratch
from
a
one
man
tool
shop
be
latin
for
great
it
s
not
a
name
that
i
picked
but
one
that
i
inherit
when
i
merge
my
young
company
with
an
electronics
and
aerospace
manufacturer
in
the
late
s
nevertheless
the
company
have
live
up
to
its
name
grow
in
size
and
strength
year
after
year
decade
after
decade
to
the
point
where
magna
today
span
the
globe
with
more
than
factory
and
r
d
centre
in
twenty
six
country
on
five
continent
moreover
magna
be
widely
regard
as
the
world
s
lead
company
in
term
of
automotive
technology
that
be
a
legacy
i
be
proud
of
and
the
creation
of
magna
be
one
of
the
last
accomplishment
that
i
would
always
like
to
be
remember
for
the
same
hold
true
for
my
activity
in
the
horse
race
business
i
ve
breed
some
of
the
great
horse
in
history
i
ve
also
try
to
modernize
the
sport
of
king
and
in
the
process
i
ve
generate
some
controversy
along
the
way
many
of
the
people
in
the
horse
race
industry
appreciate
what
i
m
try
to
do
and
support
my
effort
but
some
have
felt
i
be
not
respect
the
industry
s
heritage
and
history
even
if
they
recognize
that
the
old
way
be
no
longer
work
whatever
happens
i
hope
that
when
the
dust
settle
the
fan
and
the
horseman
the
jockey
and
the
breeder
will
all
look
back
and
say
stronach
make
a
great
contribution
to
race
if
i
have
to
name
the
accomplishment
that
i
be
most
proud
of
it
would
be
the
fair
enterprise
business
philosophy
i
developed
while
at
magna
when
i
start
out
in
business
i
didn
t
have
any
grand
philosophy
i
be
simply
struggle
to
get
the
business
off
the
ground
and
make
enough
money
to
cover
my
operating
and
living
expense
what
i
would
later
label
as
the
fair
enterprise
philosophy
the
entrepreneurial
business
principle
that
have
shape
magna
s
growth
over
the
year
be
something
that
evolve
naturally
from
the
way
my
business
grow
fair
enterprise
isn
t
just
some
ivory
tower
theory
that
exists
only
in
the
page
of
a
pamphlet
it
s
a
living
breathing
operating
philosophy
that
still
guide
the
day
to
day
operation
of
magna
s
manufacturing
facility
around
the
world
in
essence
we
ve
built
a
real
world
role
model
and
i
believe
that
any
business
that
adopts
our
philosophy
and
follow
in
our
footstep
can
attain
the
same
level
of
extraordinary
growth
and
success
pursue
excellence
the
desire
to
be
the
best
and
to
pursue
excellence
be
a
powerful
human
urge
we
need
to
be
careful
that
we
don
t
limit
or
shut
off
the
avenue
that
allow
people
to
get
ahead
and
make
a
well
life
for
themselves
and
their
family
and
we
shouldn
t
pull
down
those
who
be
try
to
rise
high
and
reach
the
very
top
of
their
respective
field
whether
it
be
business
science
academia
or
the
art
in
the
final
analysis
any
society
that
stifle
individual
in
the
pursuit
of
productivity
ingenuity
and
creativity
be
a
decay
society
chapter
return
to
my
entrepreneurial
root
the
reality
be
that
people
be
not
truly
free
unless
they
have
economic
freedom
it
s
a
shame
that
only
a
small
percentage
of
people
be
economically
free
our
challenge
therefore
be
to
figure
out
how
the
majority
of
people
can
attain
economic
freedom
i
couldn
t
sleep
anxious
for
the
day
to
begin
reflect
on
all
that
i
have
do
in
all
the
year
go
by
i
awoke
at
a
m
it
be
may
and
in
a
few
hour
in
the
ballroom
of
a
suburban
toronto
hotel
i
would
announce
that
i
have
decide
to
sell
operating
control
of
magna
international
inc
i
have
come
to
the
decision
to
relinquish
control
after
a
great
deal
of
reflection
the
timing
be
right
and
i
felt
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
what
s
more
i
be
prepared
to
accept
the
verdict
of
the
shareholder
if
they
reject
the
offer
i
would
have
remain
the
control
shareholder
either
way
i
would
have
be
happy
absorbed
in
thought
i
lose
track
of
time
and
end
up
dash
out
of
the
house
and
speed
down
the
highway
to
the
hotel
in
my
haste
head
to
the
most
important
shareholder
meeting
of
my
career
i
realize
that
i
forgot
to
put
on
a
tie
if
my
good
friend
tony
czapka
be
still
around
he
would
have
smile
and
say
no
more
monkey
suit
for
you
frank
when
i
address
magna
stockholder
for
the
last
time
as
the
control
shareholder
i
share
with
them
some
of
the
soul
search
that
lead
to
my
decision
and
i
share
as
well
some
of
my
feeling
surround
this
milestone
event
in
my
life
i
have
put
a
lot
of
real
blood
sweat
and
tear
into
grow
magna
into
the
company
it
be
today
and
i
still
know
where
pretty
much
every
screw
and
bolt
be
locate
i
built
an
automotive
powerhouse
brick
by
brick
a
company
that
be
know
and
respect
the
world
over
but
the
most
important
outcome
for
me
be
the
fact
that
magna
now
employ
more
than
people
around
the
world
when
you
think
of
the
spin
off
or
multiplier
effect
on
the
economy
that
all
those
job
create
and
when
you
count
the
family
member
who
depend
upon
those
job
the
impact
of
magna
be
enormous
touch
the
life
of
several
million
people
it
s
a
reality
i
be
always
keenly
aware
of
as
the
founder
and
chairman
the
knowledge
that
every
decision
i
make
could
directly
affect
hundred
of
thousand
of
people
magna
will
always
be
much
more
to
me
than
just
a
business
so
it
wasn
t
an
easy
decision
for
me
to
sell
control
of
the
company
i
have
nurture
why
then
do
i
sell
control
first
of
all
i
truly
felt
that
the
current
rule
and
regulation
govern
public
company
have
become
stifle
even
strangle
i
start
to
feel
that
i
be
operating
with
a
straitjacket
on
and
every
business
decision
down
to
the
minute
detail
have
to
be
double
checked
and
rubber
stamp
by
lawyer
and
bureaucrat
all
the
thrill
and
zest
that
come
with
building
something
bold
and
big
be
go
suck
dry
by
the
never
end
rule
and
regulation
second
the
horse
race
business
meant
a
great
deal
to
me
by
sell
control
of
magna
i
be
able
to
acquire
sufficient
fund
to
inject
into
the
horse
race
business
to
help
it
turn
the
corner
and
get
it
back
on
the
path
to
prosperity
and
lastly
i
be
never
meant
to
be
the
chairman
of
a
public
company
i
m
an
entrepreneur
at
heart
a
builder
of
business
look
back
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
have
no
remorse
no
regret
when
i
m
ask
why
i
relinquish
control
i
often
joke
that
i
come
to
the
realization
that
i
couldn
t
manage
magna
from
the
grave
as
much
as
i
d
want
to
but
the
reality
be
i
ve
put
in
place
a
system
and
a
set
of
operating
principle
that
be
strong
than
any
one
individual
or
group
of
people
they
ll
guide
the
company
s
future
growth
for
decade
to
come
if
magna
should
ever
stray
from
its
found
principle
or
abandon
them
altogether
then
it
will
become
just
another
company
and
even
though
i
won
t
be
on
the
stage
at
future
magna
shareholder
meeting
there
s
one
thing
you
can
be
sure
of
i
will
always
be
available
to
give
guidance
if
call
upon
and
i
will
always
be
there
for
the
company
i
found
a
reporter
recently
ask
me
how
it
felt
now
that
i
have
step
back
from
the
business
of
run
magna
i
reply
what
do
you
mean
step
back
i
m
busier
than
ever
before
my
entrepreneurial
zeal
be
as
strong
today
as
it
be
the
day
i
open
the
one
man
tool
and
die
shop
i
have
hundred
of
idea
for
new
business
new
product
and
new
service
and
in
the
year
ahead
i
intend
to
pursue
a
variety
of
venture
that
i
m
passionate
about
freed
from
the
constraint
impose
by
the
regulation
govern
public
company
i
ll
be
able
to
run
much
faster
and
with
few
string
attach
i
ll
be
an
entrepreneur
once
again
i
have
nothing
hold
me
back
i
have
the
drive
and
desire
i
have
plenty
of
resource
at
my
disposal
and
i
have
one
other
ingredient
that
i
lack
when
i
first
start
out
experience
i
be
smarter
wiser
and
more
perceptive
today
than
i
be
fifty
year
ago
or
even
five
year
ago
i
m
eighty
year
young
now
and
i
increasingly
wonder
when
will
i
slow
down
the
answer
probably
when
i
m
confine
in
a
box
in
the
meantime
i
ll
be
incubate
a
number
of
innovative
new
product
and
business
in
health
care
agriculture
real
estate
retirement
care
game
and
entertainment
and
electric
technology
it
s
like
i
m
stand
on
the
deck
of
that
old
dutch
freighter
in
the
rotterdam
harbour
as
i
do
nearly
sixty
year
ago
set
sail
for
a
new
world
nothing
but
a
vast
ocean
of
limitless
possibility
before
me
the
money
i
ve
accumulate
over
the
year
won
t
be
sit
in
a
bank
either
i
ll
put
it
to
work
to
launch
new
company
and
create
new
job
the
truth
be
nothing
compare
to
the
sense
of
satisfaction
that
come
with
building
a
business
from
the
ground
up
and
give
the
people
who
work
alongside
you
a
piece
of
the
action
that
s
what
i
will
continue
to
do
for
many
year
still
to
come
i
ll
turn
raw
material
and
idea
into
tangible
product
that
improve
people
s
life
i
ll
plow
profit
into
the
development
of
new
medicine
that
heal
and
technology
that
give
million
of
people
the
world
over
the
freedom
to
travel
in
the
end
i
ll
do
what
i
have
always
do
i
will
make
a
well
product
for
a
well
price
behind
my
home
just
past
the
horse
barn
there
s
a
spectacular
forest
fill
with
maple
birch
and
pine
early
morning
i
enjoy
go
for
a
walk
through
the
wood
by
myself
with
the
sun
rise
behind
the
tree
i
m
not
an
overly
religious
man
but
i
sometimes
stop
and
pause
marvel
at
the
splendour
of
nature
the
dew
sparkle
on
the
grass
like
a
thousand
diamond
and
i
say
a
silent
prayer
i
thank
god
for
all
the
blessing
i
ve
receive
and
i
hope
that
i
can
make
a
contribution
to
well
the
life
of
people
at
this
point
in
my
life
i
m
not
look
for
title
or
honorary
degree
or
medal
i
want
to
be
of
service
to
society
i
want
to
make
a
last
contribution
one
that
set
society
on
a
new
and
positive
course
i
want
to
do
my
part
to
build
a
society
that
be
more
prosperous
and
more
democratic
a
society
that
have
great
fairness
and
great
freedom
most
of
all
i
want
to
find
way
of
give
people
the
opportunity
to
pursue
the
same
road
to
economic
freedom
that
i
follow
